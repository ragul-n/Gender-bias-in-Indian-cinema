00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:51,958
Hi!

5
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is your Vaishnavi,

6
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:55,042
Welcoming everyone to
"You can Cook Too"

7
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:58,583
Here I'll make varied delicacies
and showcase it everyday.

8
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,250
So come on, let's go!

9
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:05,000
Now I'm going to make
Organic Veg Cake,

10
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,958
This is Vallarai paste,

11
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:08,333
and this is Karslangani.

12
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,042
Everything being used
here are herbal products.

13
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,875
Once I'm done baking the cake,
will upload the recipe.

14
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,958
Tada! and the cake is ready!

15
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,875
Didn't I mention how
easy is to bake a cake.

16
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:29,333
I hope you guys will try this
at home and enjoy the same.

17
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,667
So tomorrow it's a new
day and a new recipe,

18
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,500
I'll meet you guys once again.

19
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,833
Until then this is Vaishnavi,
signing off with loads of love.

Ok, Bye!

21
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,042
I'm done with just drooling
at her on You Tube.

22
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,875
I'm going to directly attack.

23
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:51,500
Bobby, Yes!

24
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,875
Where's that Organic Cake?

25
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm going to ravish it.

26
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,917
Can't be found.

27
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,625

28
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,125
Oh no!

29
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,542
It's like a new slab
of Black Forest cake.

30
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,125
I'm going to eat it.

31
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,208
I haven't brushed my teeth.

32
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:22,417
You've been giving
me sleepless nights.

00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:23,125
It's my turn...

34
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,208
Ghost!

35
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,292
Came for Black Forest, but
this is a Black Ghost!

36
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,083
Who's that?

37
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,208
Who's this standing in
middle of the road?

38
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,625
Oh God, no...it's a witch,

39
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,333
please someone save me.

Nothing, let's go.

Vaishu, we got a new
order for the cake,

63
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,750
enough with the suspense
and tell me Balki.

instead of the cream...

65

...they want to put their name
and age mixed with poison on it.

Balki stop kidding.

67
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,542
I'm not kidding.

68

The order is from
your friend Ambujam.

Go and ask her.

Hey Ambujam!

71
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,208
Hello Sir, it's been long
since you've visited...

72
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:25,958
Why are you crying?

73
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:27,042
Look here,

74
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,250
tell me what's the problem.

75
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,083
I got permission from my family,

76
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,875
also have fixed the
date for engagement.

77
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,208
Then what's the issue?

78
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:38,792
Is he demanding a fat dowry?

79
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,042
Nothing of that sort.

80
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,375
He's got a job in London.

81
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,958
since he got the Visa, his
activities are weird.

82
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,417
If I call he
disconnects the call,

83
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,500
and is avoiding to meet,
whenever I tried to.

84
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:55,125
I suspect that he's having
an affair in London.

85
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,375
I'm really scared Vaishu.

86
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:59,625
I'll die if I don't get him.

87
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:00,667

Ok!

90
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,833
Where's he right now?

91
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,083
Excuse me!

92
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,792
Uh!...Excuse me!

93
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,333
YES...YES...YES!!!

Hey Cotton!

96
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:25,500
Is it you!?

97
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:26,375
Did you expect Thala
Ajith or what?

98
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,000
You fell in love with this pig?

99
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,292
Don't insult him Vaishu.

100
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,708
He's sweet!

101
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,542
Eyyy!

102
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:36,208
-Are you out of you senses?
-Why?

103
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,042
-You rather die than marrying this Hippo.
-Water Elephant!

104
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,625
Vaishu, it takes a while
for him to grow on you.

105
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:41,500
Hey Ambujam!

106
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,375
Why did you bring her here?
Take her outside.

107
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,250
-Don't get angry.
-Lower your voice.

108
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,208
Here on, she won't speak,
I'll speak for her.

109
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,833
I won't speak, 'cause
I'm really busy.

110
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,500
So you won't speak to me?

111
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,667
-Ya!
-You'll be in relationship for 4 years.

112
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,167
Then you'll start
avoiding calls.

113
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,917
If asked for reason,
you won't speak.

114
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:56,958
Didn't you do the same?

115
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,917
Do you think women
are so easy to you.

116
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,958
Hey...It's neither
easy nor tough,

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,958
this is my personal issue,
mind your own business.

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,417
I'm busy and I have
to go to the toilet.

119
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,833
For what? Are you
going to clean it?

120
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,917
How do you know that?

121
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,458
I'll whack you and
tear your face apart.

122
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,917
To you it's personal,

123
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,042
but to her it's life.

124
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,958
Can't bear looking at
your face for 4 minutes,

125
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:14,542
Insult!

126
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,875
But she's been in love
with you for 4 years.

127
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:17,875
It's 'cause of my personality.

128
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,042
Rightfully she
should've avoided you.

129
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,458
Hey I'm warning you,

130
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,792
if you dump her

131
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,458
will skin you alive.

132
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Skin me alive uh!?

133
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,458
Thought she was sane,
but sounds insane.

134
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,958
Fine, what do you want me to do?

135
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,583
Agree to the engagement.

136
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,000
-And apologize to her,
-Me!?

137
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,167
that too right away.

138
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,042
in front of me.

139
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,500
Before that, let us discuss
something in private,

140
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,958
and come to a settlement
or a compromise.

141
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,167
Hey, you get out.

142
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,625
Why should I go out?

143
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,042
She's here for me.

144
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,375
I'm responsible
for her security,

145
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,125
I can't leave her alone.

146
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,750
Hey...just calm down.

147
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:54,417
Don't think too much of
him, he's not worth it.

148
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,625
How is that she knows?

149
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,208
You get out, I'll deal with him.

150
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,625
Didn't you hear, get out!

151
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,250
If you don't get out, I'll
bash you with the computer.

152
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,875
Vaishu!

153
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,542
I've switched off the cameras,

154
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,625
I won't upload any
pictures on Facebook.

-Vaishu!
-Hmmm.

158
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,667
If you let people know about it.

159
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,042
It'll be embarrassing to you.

160
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,917
Ok, shouldn't let this out.

161
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:18,583
Ok!?

162
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,250
What...What are you going to do?

163
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,875
I'm getting ready for it.

164
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,208
Stand still, I'll come closer.

165
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,250
Now you'll see.

166
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,875
The leg is moving up,

167
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,167
I'm not worthy enough
to get slipper-ed, Vaishu.

168
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,750
Vaishu, for God sake
only you can save me.

169
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,542
Only you can help me with this.

170
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,625
I won't get up, I will get up
only after you swear on God.

171
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,083
Tell me.

172
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,125
Ok Promise, get up.

173
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:36,917
Fine then.

174
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,292
What's it!?

175
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,500
She must've mentioned I
got a job in London.

176
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,917
Ya, she also mentioned
you got the Visa.

177
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,292
That's when all these
issues started.

178
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,250
I applied for work after
stealing your recipe.

179
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,542
I got the job and the Visa.

180
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:53,500
Then what's the issue?

181
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,667
I don't have and issue,
it's my friend who does,

182
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,458
I don't understand.

183
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:59,000
Just like I did, even my
friend used fake certificate,

184
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,792
went on and joined a
cake shop in London.

185
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,292
The owner found out
he can't bake.

186
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,042
After which he complained
to the Police,

187
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,250
and they arrested him.

188
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,292
If I go there, I might
get caught too.

189
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,208
If I'm here, would've lied
and got married to her,

190
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,458
and would've lived my entire
life with guilty conscience.

191
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,042
That's why I made the decision.

192
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,375
And dumped Ambujam.

193
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,625
-Bloody sinner.
-What's it?

194
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:18,625
Then what about her?

195
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:19,500
As if it's something new to you.

196
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,000
She'll get someone better.

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,167
-Hey!
-Eh!

198
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,042
Don't stare at me.

199
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,750
If you co-operate we can get
a solution to this issue.

200
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,583
What can I do in this?

201
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:31,958
Can you come along
as my assistant?

202
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,708
-Damn you!
-Eh...Eh..Eh!

203
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,417
To others you're an assistant,

204
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,917
I'll be your assistant in real.

205
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,125
Is that fine?

206
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,125
It's 'cause you're
good at baking cakes.

207
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,708
With that, I'll take the
credit for baking it.

208
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,792
This is just for 2 months,

209
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,958
after which I'll
pick up on things.

210
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,375
And will become a great Chef.

211
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,583
You can get back to
India after that.

212
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,125
Ambujam will be happy too.

213
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,042
What do you say?

214
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,542
If you agree to this, I'll
agree to get married.

215
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,792
If not...

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,417
...I have to take
up the alternate.

217
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:01,542
No...Never!

218
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,708
I won't allow this.

219
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,958
A girl going alone all
the way to London,

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,125
do you know how far that is?

221
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,333
When we don't send a girl
alone in our own city,

222
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,417
look here Vaishu!

223
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,500
He's like a dried up river,

224
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,833
why do you have to go
to London for his sake?

225
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,292
Balki stop talking nonsense.

226
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:15,375
Ambujam is a poor thing.

227
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,333
Her marriage shouldn't
hit a bump.

228
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,458
Mom, you tell me...

229
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,667
...are you scared?

230
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,250
I'm not scared...

231
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:24,667
It's fine if its
only for few days,

232
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,750
but staying away from you
for months is quite tough.

233
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,000
Mom, I can understand
your feelings.

234
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,917
Now that we have internet,

235
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:34,458
I'll make a video call
daily and speak to you.

236
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,458
You won't get the feeling
that I'm far off in London.

237
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,750
I've also appointed someone
to manage the Cake Shop.

238
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,583
Vaishu!

239
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,458
Who's more important,
Mom or Ambujam?

240
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,125
Listen to what I have to say.

241
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:46,542
You're well aware, that Ambujam got
in Medical University of Delhi,

242
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,417
she rejected it for my sake.

243
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,958
She rejected studying
Medical just for my sake.

244
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,250
If I don't do this, her
marriage will be called off.

245
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,833
Dad, you tell me now...

246
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,583
...Vaishu you're very bold.

247
00:12:57,792 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm fine with your decisions.

248
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:01,708
Thank you Dad.

249
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,542
Just 'cause your Dad is
fine, doesn't count,

250
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,542
I won't agree to it,
you shouldn't go.

251
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,875
-Not allowed
-He's right.

252
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,083
-Balki!
-Uh!?

253
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,500
You're coming to London
with me, the Visa is ready.

254
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,417
Is it confirmed? then fine.

255
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,792
Women have reached moon,

256
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:19,125
London is right here.

257
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,833
Just 10 hours away,
why can't she go?

258
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,708
Tables have turned.

259
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,125

00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,125

Look here, Vaishu!

315
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,750
Hey Madhu!

316
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:46,333
A chick coming with tow monkeys.

317
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,833
Who's that? Looks
like a janitor.

318
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,625
-Hi Madhu!
-Good to see you.

319
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,958
-Hi Vaishu!
-Welcome to London.

320
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,042
Vaishu you look way prettier
than we saw you on Skype.

321
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,958
People say the same about me.

322
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,500
-Who are there people?
-This is Balki and Cotton.

323
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:02,000
What!? Did you say cotton?

324
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:03,875
Hey my name is Panjabikesan.

325
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,250
In short Panju...

326
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,458
if swag added then it's Cotton!

327
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,542
OH!

328
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,000
That's why your face
looks like that,

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,875
dummy face.

330
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:11,417
Shut up!

331
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,167
Take a selfie and
upload on Facebook.

332
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,167
Check in London!

333
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:16,583
Many will be jealous.

334
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:17,875
Come on, come on, come on.

335
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:19,958
Vaishu don't listen to him,
you'll end in trouble.

336
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,750
Vaishu, let's visit
New York on the way.

337
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,333
Oh God, Balki New
York is in America.

338
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,667
Did you see that, they
scrapped it from our country,

339
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,208
and have decorated theirs.

340
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,417
It looks awesome.

341
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,750
That building looks
like a cooking pot.

342
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,792
That building is really tall.

343
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,583
Look here, this London's
famous Tower Bridge.

344
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,833
Nothing can beat
our Cooum Bridge.

345
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,042
I'm really happy that, that you
guys are staying at our place.

346
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,750

-Thank you Ganesh.

Vaishu this is our house.

350
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,125

351
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,667
-This is our Sweet Home
-Wow!

352
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,625
Wow, is this where
we're going to stay?

353
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,667
This place doesn't
have big trees,

354
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,250
-What's he looking for?
-It's quite urgent though...

355
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,292
Hey Cotton, there's a
stream behind the house.

356
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,375
Once we're done with morning
business and bathing,

357
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:15,625
we'll be fresh as the
dew on the flower.

358
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,958
So Shall I get the
Soap and towel?

359
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,958
Get a washing Soap too,
have wash my underwear.

360
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,958
And you'll be locked up in the
jail wearing those undies.

361
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,500
Why?

362
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,625
It's not just the
morning business,

363
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:26,000
if you even try a bit to dirty
the place, they'll lock you up.

364
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:28,000
Did you get that?
Better be careful.

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,792
Looks like no one takes a
bath just like you don't.

366
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,792
I just love the interiors.

367
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,542
-Come on guys...
-Move on, we'll come.

368
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,458
Wow!

369
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:41,500
Madhu, the prayer room
is so well maintained.

370
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,458
Thank you Vaishu.

371
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,583
She's not maintaining this.

372
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,875
A Iyer comes down every Friday,

373
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,125
he's the one who looks
after this room.

374
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,292
So you're just a dummy!?

375
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,375
Even she's maintaining
me as her Husband.

376
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,083
-Thought as much.
-Shut up and come.

377
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,167
Vaishu, you guys freshen up...

378
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,417
...meanwhile I'll
order take out.

379
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:56,667
Why do you have to order?

380
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,708
I'll cook.

381
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,958
-Show me your kitchen
-Sure I will.

382
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:00,750
Wow!

383
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:01,792
Don't dip your face into it.

384
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:03,542
It smells soooo Good!

385
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,458
It gives the same aroma as
the food from Maami Mess.

386
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:09,625
Brinjal fry, Rice
fries, Spicy curry

387
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,833
Beans fry, Curd
curry and Papads.

388
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,458
Awesome, what a combination.

389
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,125
Hey, have you taken enough rice?

390
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,333
Fine, no one should come close
to this cooker anymore.

391
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,667
Are you planning to
wash it after the meal,

392
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,333
or will you just
lick it entirely?

393
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:21,917
Hey get lost.

394
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:22,792
It's not that,

395
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,917
We put rice and curry
on the plate to eat.

396
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,292
But he puts the curry
in the pot and eat.

397
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,417
As if this is rocket science.

398
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,542
Thanks a lot buddy.

399
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:30,875
Listen...

400
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,625
Eating the food at this house,

401
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,667
my taste buds have
died long back.

402
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,500
I've eaten things which
a human being won't.

403
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:40,708
Hey get lost from here.

404
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,667
-Hey cotton?
-What's it?

405
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,958
He doesn't seem like her
Husband nor a cook...

406
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
...what else his role could be?

407
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:47,958
May be he sweeps...

408
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,125
-Ah!
-Ah...!

409
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,167
Hey what are you saying?

410
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,167
I meant he must doing
the janitor's job.

411
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,167
Oh you meant that.

412
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:54,542
Ey! what were you thinking?

413
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,000
-Mind voice...
-You heard it as well?

414
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,500
Yes I did.

415
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,000
Whether it's Mind
Voice or Open Voice?

416
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,208
It doesn't matter to me, as
I'm not offended at all.

417
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:04,333
Didn't I say, that
he's a shameless.

418
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,625
No he's beyond that.

419
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:07,917
-Why is he laughing?
-Funny Guy

420
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,417
Who are you calling a pig?

421
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,167
If I throw that on your
face, You'll be upset.

422
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:13,583
I'm insulting you, and
you're being shameless.

423
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,417
Hey, why did the Ice Cream
truck come inside the house?

424
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,625
Stop ringing the bell.

425
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,292
Oh God, it's a Ghost!

426
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,750
Bloody it's that
Whats-App Saint.

427
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,250
Can't find his seeders
along with him.

428
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,958
You look like a
ghost from behind.

429
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,083
First tie that hair up.

430
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,208
Your face looks like
a ghost, damn it.

431
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,250
-Where's the Ghost?
-Ghost! where's it?

432
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:41,667
Where's the ghost?
Where's the Ghost?

433
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,958
I mistook Iyer for the Ghost.

434
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,792
Oh God!

435
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,333
You can continue
with the chants.

436
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,625
I'm going to be chanting
just one Mantra,

437
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,125
-Madhu!?
-Ah!

438
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,708
You had mentioned about an Iyer who
maintains you on weekly basis,

439
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:53,667
is that him?

440
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,875
It's him, shameless
bugger laughing.

441
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:59,542
He's insulting your wife
right in front of you,

442
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:00,917
instead of giving him a punch,

443
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:03,833
you're excited and laughing as
if you've heard a punchline.

444
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,542
If I give you another slap, you'll
find yourself at your Mom's place.

445
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,500
Don't come inside.

446
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,042
Isn't that should be his line,

447
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,083
It's all in the game ya...yeah!

448
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,417
It doesn't hurt...It
doesn't hurt!

449
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,792
Don't pretend as if
it doesn't hurt.

450
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,708
Vaishu, I've told the owner that
you guys are my assistants.

451
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,250
You should do a great job.

452
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:21,875
You won't change, do you?

453
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:22,958
-Hey Balki!
-What's it?

454
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,875
Don't be a loose mouth
and get me caught.

455
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:25,875
May be I won't.

456
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,500
The owner is here, don't
do something stupid.

457
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,000
Don't keep repeating yourself,

458
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,083
I'll forget then.

459
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,667
Wonder what kind of meeting
he's going to hold.

460
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:32,500
Hi Buddy!

461
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,333
First day looks
like a bleak one.

462
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,292
This the man you
were looking for.

463
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:36,542
-Hi!
-Nice to meet you.

464
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:37,542
Asta Limba!

465
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,125
Ok, Ok Mr.Cotton.

466
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,250
They're here to order
a very special cake.

467
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:44,167
Your first order on the
first day at this shop.

468
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,167
Damn he's done.

469
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,167
-Understand!?
-I don't get, what Stand he's mentioning

470
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,375
Ok, tell me what
you want to order?

471
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:51,042
-We want something different
-Ya Ya!

472
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,125
Did he say YG Mahendran?

473
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,208
Sure, we would like a 3D Cake.

474
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,375
What's he even saying
about 3D and CD?

475
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,167
Vaishu, save me from this clown.

476
00:22:58,292 --> 00:23:00,458
You mean a 3D cake with
3 layers of cream,

477
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,083
one with the fruit and
one with the nuts.

478
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,125
That's right!

479
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,458
Can be done.

480
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,333
You're aware of
my formula right?

481
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:09,167
So get the gas running
and boil the milk.

482
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,292
Oh hold on! Hold on!

483
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:10,958
Did he find out?

484
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,292
Aren't you the Chef?

485
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,625
Why are you telling her to go?

486
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:15,417
No no, he's just giving
me the instructions.

487
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:17,583
She's right, they're
my assistants.

488
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,125
This 3D one is a small cake,

489
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:20,708
I'm a Big Cake player.

490
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:23,250
One Tonne, Two Tonne,
Three Tonne...etc...

491
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,875
-Oh Really!?
-Sounds good.

492
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,750
I do everything.

493
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,833
Vaishu, if we keep speaking,
they'll find out the truth.

494
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,333
Go and do your job.

495
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,708
Sir, this lady Police
officer is pretty.

496
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,625
Where's the kitchen?

497
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,542
Around the corner.

498
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:34,500
Ok, thank you.

499
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,208
Stop wandering and
cut the onions.

500
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,708
Wonder how he ended up here.

501
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,000
Not capable of anything
but can talk well.

502
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,167
Vaishu, if anything you
have to handle it,

503
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,667
We'll handle it.

504
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,000
Stab him with that.

505
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,042
Just for fun.

506
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:49,458
Once you've emptied it that give it to
me will use the box to store tablets.

507
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:51,583
Are those white gems?

508
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:52,750
Did you think it's from Church?

509
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,792
Is this sugar free, will
come in handy for him.

510
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,375
Awesome, Vaishu
you've made a belt.

511
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,375
Tie it around your waist.

512
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:04,958
It'll look better
around your mouth.

513
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,792
Do they add these too?

514
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,833
Vaishu if the owner comes
to know, I can't bake,

515
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:15,625
He will whack me.

516
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,250
-Shall I inform him?
-Can't you just shut up?

517
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,375
Wow Vaishu, you made it
exactly as I would've.

518
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:32,125
Ey!

519
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,792
Just for fun!

520
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:36,417
Oh God no!

521
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,167
Hey, what are you guys doing?

522
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:39,792
You guys are doing
an idiotic job.

523
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,333
Why aren't the
Apples washed yet?

524
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,250
What have you guys been doing?

525
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,542
Keep a plate on his head.

526
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,750
Why are you pouring
Tar on the cake?

527
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:46,625
Isn't honey to be
poured in the mouth?

528
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,458
Keep that egg from your
mouth on top of it.

529
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,625
Doesn't seem to leave.

530
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,250
What's wrong with this capsicum?

531
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,708
Can't it be bigger?

532
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,000
Quick, quick...fast!

533
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:56,500
You guys are embarrassing me.

534
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,250
Don't stare, mind your work.

535
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,500
Owner is looking at us.

536
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:00,958
Make it, put it all in.

537
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,375
Very Good!

538
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,167
He doesn't seem to move at all.

539
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,625
Phew he's gone.

540
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,667
Vaishu!

541
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:10,250
Owner was looking here,
so was just faking it.

542
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,542
Don't take me wrong.

543
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:13,458
If not I'll lose the job.

544
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,125
If he wants something,
he'll beg...

545
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,542
...if not he'll trip us down.

546
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,333
Seems like he's planned
on doing something.

547
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,083
Don't trust him Vaishu.

548
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,917
Vaishu, you need a
brain to plan things.

549
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,833
I don't have that.

550
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:23,167
My entire lineage doesn't have.

551
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:25,292
You're right about that,
he's a poor thing.

552
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,375
Fine, the cake is ready.

553
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:27,625
Let's deliver it to them.

554
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,250
Shall I deliver it myself?

555
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:30,625
Please don't stare at me.

556
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,625
Keep the game face on.

557
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,208
Only then they'll
believe I made it.

558
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:36,458
Ah...here's your cake.

559
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:37,250
Asta Limba!

560
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:38,500
Oh Wow, you were really quick.

561
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,542
I made it, please
share it wisely.

562
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,792
-Sure Thank you.
-Hold this.

563
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,333
Wow, smells lovely.

564
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,583
Ya smells beautiful.

565
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:46,333
Ya!

566
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,625
Shouldn't come back again, if not
will boil you along with the water.

567
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:50,083
You're so good.

568
00:25:50,292 --> 00:25:51,292
Asta...!

569
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Lampa!

570
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:53,708
See you, Bye-Bye!

571
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:57,667
♫

572
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:02,208
♫

573
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:03,250
Vaishu!

574
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:04,625
-Uh!
-Thank you.

575
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:05,708
For what?

576
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,958
I think that foreigner
is in love with me.

577
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,125
Oh no, this is too much.

578
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,042
What did you say?

579
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:12,667
Didn't you see that
hug and the kiss?

580
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,167
Damn you!

581
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:17,042
This is their culture and
they say thank you like that.

582
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:19,333
Culture can be taught
to a human being,

583
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,375
how would this hippo understand?

584
00:26:21,542 --> 00:26:23,542
Hey, go and wipe those tables.

585
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,458
Ok damn it!

586
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,958
Hey, that comedy is old now.

587
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:26,917
So are you...

588
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:27,792
-get lost!
-Ok!

589
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:37,000
Don't know who's it that stealing
the dry fruits from the cakes.

590
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:38,667
If I get hold of him
will mince him.

591
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,542
He's been here since we're open.

592
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,375
Hey, Chef...Chef!

593
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:44,375
-What's it?
-Please come here.

594
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:45,250
-You're calling me?
-Yes...Yes!

595
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,917
He looks like the male
version of Hansika.

596
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,042
What do you want?

597
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:50,208
I would like to order
a cake for my wife.

598
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,042
Oh! What's your wife's name?

599
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,125
To put it on the cake.

600
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,125
Ok, Kardashi Ramiah!

601
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:57,625
Did he say Kuthu Ramya?

602
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,875
How do you know Kuthu Ramya?

603
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,750
May be they're Facebook friends.

604
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,000
Is your wife's name...

605
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:03,792
...Kuthu Ramya?

606
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:04,833
No...no!

607
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,583
Kardashi Ramkiah!

608
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,958
What kinda name is this?

609
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:10,583
It'll take a week for me
write this on the cake.

610
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,083
Please wait here,

611
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,125
I'll go and send my assistant.

612
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:14,917
What do you want to eat?

613
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,125
-Vaishu!
-The rodent is here.

614
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,292
Always bickering.

615
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,458
There's a Jersey Cow sitting there,
he's irritating the hell out of me.

616
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,875
He wants to put his
wife's name on the cake.

617
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:24,125
Then write it!

618
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,917
I don't understand what he's saying,
that's why asking your help.

619
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,917
Cotton I can't just leave now.

620
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,958
You be calm and write it down.

621
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,708
Hey, won't you
listen to you Chef?

622
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,875
-Hey!
-Sorry sister!

623
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:34,708
It's not that Vaishu.

624
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,875
Listening to him speak English,
I'll forget the little I know.

625
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:39,375
Please go.

626
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,792
-Why are you lying?
-What do you mean?

627
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:41,458
That you know English.

628
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,833
It's not the time for it.

629
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:45,042
Vaishu, I beg of you.

630
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,708
Please the owner might be here

631
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,542
Hey what's wrong with the car?

632
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:49,250
Fine, which table is he at?

633
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,542
He's at Table No.5

634
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,708
Give me that notepad

635
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:52,875
You go!

636
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,833
That was a close one.

637
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:57,958
Ok!

638
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:00,917
I'll call you back.

639
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,833
Why am I not able
to stop this noise?

640
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:08,250
-Hi
-Hmmm!

641
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,167
Can I have you
wife's name please?

642
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:12,000
What!?

643
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:15,125
Can I, Can I have
your wife's name?

644
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:16,500
Sorry!

645
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:21,042
Why is he saying Sorry,
when asked for Wife's name.

646
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,083
Laughing like a dumbo.

647
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:26,208
Don't you know your wife's name?

648
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:27,917
My wife!?

649
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:29,333
He's so arrogant,

650
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:31,167
bloody monger, bloody monger

651
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:34,792
fool, idiot, con and
stupid of the first kind.

652
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,417
-Don't you know your wife's name?
-Are you talking to me?

653
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,792
No...No...no, I
was just singing.

654
00:30:38,792 --> 00:30:40,958
I was just singing in my head.

655
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:41,333
Ok!

656
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:47,000
Tell me Mom.

657
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:48,500
What's it?

658
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:49,458
Damn you Vaishnavi!

659
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:50,333
Did you say Kumudham!?

660
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,333
Bloody!

661
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:52,667
I'll pick it up on the way.

662
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:53,708
Ok, bye!

663
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,875
I'm really sorry.

664
00:30:56,917 --> 00:30:58,292
I didn't know you
were a Tamizhan...

665
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,042
Hi, I'm Sandeep.

666
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:04,583
Please to meet you.

667
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,833
Hi I'm Vaishnavi!

668
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,250
Ah!...It's weird.

669
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:25,500
Nice to meet you.

670
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,792
I'm very glad to have met you.

671
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:28,417
Thank you!

672
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,250
The joy doubles when
you meet your people.

673
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:35,583
One Cappuccino please.

674
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:37,125
Sure 8 pounds.

675
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:37,833
No cream!

676
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,167
Thank you!

677
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,167
-There you go.
-Thank you.

678
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:43,875
Welcome Ma'am.

679
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:44,625
Hey Madhu!

680
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,167
I met an interesting
guy yesterday.

681
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:48,750
You usually don't
talk about guys.

682
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:51,000
I don't, but he spoke in Tamil.

683
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:52,750
Is he from our place?

684
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:53,958
I think so.

685
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Usually they're all good.

686
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:56,333
I think so too.

687
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,042
Bujji Dear!

688
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,667
I didn't know he was
Tamil and mocked him.

689
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,792
My dear daughter!

690
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:01,958
Bujji Dear!

691
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:10,417
Bujji Dear!

692
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,792
Bujji Dear!

693
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,208
Next let's go to the other side.

694
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,542
Bujji Dear!

695
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:20,792
It's already the closing time.

696
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,625
Bujji Dear!

697
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:25,958
Who's that?

698
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,083
Is she calling you?

699
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,083
-Madhu over here
-Oh ok!

700
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,250
Bujji Dear!

701
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,917
Tell me more about him.

702
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:44,042
Except for his name, I
don't know anything.

703
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,792
Bujji Dear! Bujji Dear!

704
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,083
So girls like the
mystery these days.

705
00:32:58,292 --> 00:32:59,750
If you come to know
more about him tell me.

706
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:00,625
Sure I will.

707
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:03,208
-Come this side.
-Why?

708
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,792
Want to check which

Please look at me.

711
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:11,917
Bujji Dear!

712
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:14,792
Who is she calling out to?

713
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,542
Oh no! the train is here.

714
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,708
The train is here let's leave.

715
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,792
This is the most convenient
means of transport here.

716
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:35,208
-Let's sit here
-Ok.

717
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,542
Bujji Dear!

718
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,250
Taxi!

719
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,458
You were here first,
please go ahead.

720
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,167
No it's fine, I'll leave.

721
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:22,917
Hey...Hey...Hey!

722
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:27,000
If you don't mind,

723
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,708
can I drop you?

724
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:32,250
Ok!

725
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:33,292
Ok.

726
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:42,292
You know what, I don't
believe in co-incidences.

727
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,208
But I believe now.

728
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:48,583
Actually it's interesting,

729
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:51,625
Monger head, Dumbo....etc...

730
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:52,583
Oh no!

731
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,167
Con! A Con!

732
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,250
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

733
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:57,917
I didn't know that you
understand the language.

734
00:34:58,583 --> 00:35:00,458
But it wasn't intentional.

735
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:01,917
It just happened,

736
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,250
didn't mean to.

737
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,542
But a mistake is a mistake.

738
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:06,042
And I'm really sorry.

739
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,333
Hey...hey all well!

740
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:09,917
I'm not angry, it's
ok don't worry.

741
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,458
Thank you!

742
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,792

743
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,875

will be thrilling to you guys.

744
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,167
what we're going to do
is, how an Italian dish

745
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,917
will have an Indian flavour.

746
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,250

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,250

My parents got divorced.

799
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,625
I'm the only child, I chose
to stay with my Mom.

800
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:19,500
Mom!

801
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:23,792
-Mom.
-Come in, Sandeep.

802
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,375
That's Vaishnavi.

803
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,750
-Greetings Mom.
-Greetings!

804
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:30,208
Come in Vaishnavi, sit down.

805
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:31,542
Feel at home.

806
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:33,542
Sandeep had mentioned...

807
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,750
I've downloaded all
your programs.

808
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:37,792
But never tried
making even one dish.

809
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,625
Not an issue, I'll
make it for you.

810
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,958
You just have to taste them.

811
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,667
Oh no, it's fine. Just sit down.

812
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,625
-Mom!?
-Hmmm.

813
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:44,833
Do you like Vaishu?

814
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:48,125
Food is the only thing which
we makes our heart content.

815
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:50,958
But when a girl, who can make that
with great taste for the entire life,

816
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:53,500
is going to be my daughter-in-law,
I'm very happy about it.

817
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,667
My son is very lucky.

818
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,625
-Thank you Mom.
-You really are lucky.

819
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,250
Ya I know Mom.

820
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,542
Should I drop her and come back.

821
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:02,583
Fine.

822
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:03,625
-Bye Mom.
-Let's go.

823
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,708
-Ok dear.
-Thanks Mom.

824
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,083
-I'll see you.
-Take care.

825
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,125
-Bye.
-Bye.

826
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:07,708
Come.

827
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,125
-She's really sweet.
-I know.

828
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,083
Come in Sandeep, I'll
introduce you to my friends.

829
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,167
Sorry Vaishnavi, can I
meet them some other time.

830
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm going to Austria tonight.

831
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,375
But I'm back in 15 days.

832
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:25,750
Is it really important?

833
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:27,792
Business calling.

834
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:29,917
-Ok.
-Ok.

835
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,625
Alright then.

836
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:32,333
-Take care
-Bye!

837
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,000
Be good.

838
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:35,958
-See you
-Cheers!

839
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,417
Wow beautiful flower.

840
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,208
How would you know
the worth of it?

841
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:45,875
Hi Dog!

842
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:47,125
Why are you disturbing him?

843
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:47,875
That isn't Dog, it's Doug.

844
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,000
Why is it all decorated?

845
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:49,958
Today is Queen's birthday.

846
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,333
Oh so today is Queen's Birthday?

847
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:52,375
-Bro!
-What's it?

848
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:54,833
What's your routine on Sundays?

849
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,500
A quarter in the morning, then one in the
afternoon along with a pint of a beer

850
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,417
finally in the night a half bottle
with Biriyani and get sloshed.

851
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,083
-So you're same as me.
-How did you find out?

852
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,542
It's written on your face.

853
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,750
-So tonight let's have a drink.
-Vaishu, look how they got along.

854
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,458
Madhu, cut an apple for Vaishu.

855
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:09,417
Where's the apple?

856
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:10,542
How come a truck
is on the water?

857
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,542
You guys were raving
about Thames and London,

858
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,000
This looks like our
local boating house.

859
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:14,958
Oh so do you go there as well?

860
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,250
We do it every weekend.

861
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:17,750
Oh no I dropped my chain.

862
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:19,583
Vaishu, my chain
fell into the water.

863
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,958
Wedding chain fell
into the water?

864
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,500
When did I ever wear one?

865
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:23,792
It's my wrist bracelet.

866
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:25,500
You can instead die,
rather getting insulted.

867
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:26,708
Hey, you're being disrespectful.

868
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,167
Your wife doesn't
seem to respect you.

869
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,750
I bought that in Paris, it
was blessed by Venus God.

870
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:32,083
It's a very lucky one.

871
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,708
Vaishu I want that
bracelet back, Vaishu.

872
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,125
It's a sentimental one.

873
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:35,875
Don't worry.

874
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,875
Ask him if he has something
to stop the boat.

875
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:39,417
What's that in English?
What's it called?

876
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:40,875
-Anchor!
-Anchor, please.

877
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:42,292
Ok wait I'll give you.

878
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:43,708
Give that to me.

879
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,125
Hey don't shake the boat.

880
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,083
-Give that.
-Anchor it.

881
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:48,000
Put it there.

882
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:48,958
Right there.

883
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,875
Exactly where he says.

884
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:50,625
Vaishu right there.

885
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,375
One, Two, Three.

886
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,958
Ya we got a catch, put it in your pocket.

887
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,208
Move the boat a bit.

888
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:04,042
-Hey!
-What's it?

889
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,042
Shouldn't we check
where we lost it.

890
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:06,583
Just a miss!

891
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,042
Vaishu, you carry on.

892
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:44,250
-Oh we got it...
-Tada! it's here.

893
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:45,125
Thank God.

894
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:46,167
A shell is along
with the bracelet.

895
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:47,375
What else? For the obvious.

896
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:48,792
-Vaishu
-Hmmm

897
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,167
what's this dirty thing?
Throw it away.

898
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,208
Hey this is found
only in Indian Ocean.

899
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:54,375
This is called Conch
Shell, a rare kind.

900
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,250
Keep it safe, Peter
be careful with it.

901
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,250
-What happened?
-Vaishu!?

902
00:42:58,333 --> 00:42:59,333
What happened Vaishu?

903
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,500
I cut my finger on
the sharp edge.

904
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,417
I did tell you.

905
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:03,875
It's just a cut.

906
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You never listen.

907
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:06,167
It's ok, I'm fine.

908
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,542
Tie your finger with this.

909
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:09,375
No issues, It's ok.

910
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:10,708
It'll be fine, If I wash it off.

911
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:40,250
Vaishu, what's so
special about this?

912
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,250
You're being so
particular about it.

913
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:42,708
The specialty of this Shell,

914
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,417
is that if we keep it
in the prayer room,

915
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:45,875
the house will stay
blessed with happiness.

916
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:47,667
-Is that so?
-All good will happen.

917
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,625
I think, finally I'll
have my wedding night.

918
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:50,625
Shall I put turmeric.

919
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:52,292
Try saying the same to your wife
and see what she does to you.

920
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,833
Why don't you just shut up.

921
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:09,583
It's been well cleaned.

922
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:11,625
No no, give it to the elders.

923
00:44:11,667 --> 00:44:12,792
He's scared of the Shell.

924
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:13,875
-Keep this in the prayer room
-Uh!

925
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,250
He looks exactly like
the guy from graveyard.

926
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:16,000
I'll throw this milk away.

927
00:44:16,042 --> 00:44:17,042
Where is she taking this?

928
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,875
Keep that aside, we can
use it make coffee.

929
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Ganesh, were you discussing
about the wedding night?

930
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:22,250
Go and clean that table.

931
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,417
-Can you bend over?
-What!?

932
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,375
Can you bend over and
get me that cloth.

933
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,375
That's better.

934
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,333
Lord Perumal, save us all.

935
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,042
Where's the water?

936
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:13,458
Damn!

937
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,250
-Ganesh!
-Hmmm!

938
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:19,333
-Ganesh!
-Are you fine with it now?

939
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:21,250
Go and get me cold
water from downstairs.

940
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:24,167
Will you do it after I
get you some water?

941
00:46:24,167 --> 00:46:25,375
Hey get lost!

942
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:29,167
Hey...It's going to be fun.

943
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,042
I'll be back.

944
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:40,000
First I'll fill the
bottle with water.

945
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:42,167
Then will have to impress her.

946
00:46:58,042 --> 00:46:59,042
Ah! Ghost!

947
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:02,083
Ghost! Ghost!

948
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,417
Ganesh, what happened?

949
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:05,167
Ganesh, what happened? Ganesh.

950
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:07,417
Ganesh why are you screaming?

951
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:09,792
What happened Ganesh?

952
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:10,958
Where are you now?

953
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,750
Ganesh, what happened?

954
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:15,250
Oh it's you.

955
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:16,125
Why are you screaming like this?

956
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,917
Gho...Gho...Ghost!!!

957
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,958
It's sitting right
inside the Fridge.

958
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,958
Are you dreaming?

959
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:23,167
It's nothing but the leftover
chicken which is inside the Fridge.

960
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:23,708
Not the Ghost.

961
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:26,500
Oh no! I swear there's
ghost inside.

962
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,500
You go and check.

963
00:47:27,542 --> 00:47:28,542
Did he really see a Ghost?

964
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:30,417
-Ah! Ey!
-Don't try to escape.

965
00:47:30,542 --> 00:47:31,542
Come and show me the ghost.

966
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:32,917
Fine, you go in the front.

967
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:36,792
If at there's no Ghost in there,

968
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:37,500
I'll make mango
chutney out of you.

969
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:39,000
If you don't believe,
check inside that Fridge.

970
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,000
Inside that Fridge?

971
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,583
-I'll look
-Please do.

972
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,458
Where did the Ghost leave?

973
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,125
Where's the chicken missing now?

974
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:50,375
You had the entire chicken
inside the fridge,

975
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:52,750
leaving the bones. And fooling
me with Horror stories.

976
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,375
Bloody, I'm going to...

977
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,417
Hey, I didn't hit you,
why are you screaming?

978
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,583
Ghost!...Ghost!

979
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:01,750
The Ghost is inside.

980
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:03,375
The Ghost is out there.

981
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:09,208
Hey! Look closely
that's your shadow.

982
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:12,958
Take a good look,
wave your hands.

983
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,083
Is it for real?

984
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:15,958
Wave it properly.

985
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:17,583
That's waving back at you.

986
00:48:18,292 --> 00:48:19,958
Now do you believe
it's your shadow.

987
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:21,833
Just a glimpse, shook me up.

988
00:48:22,292 --> 00:48:23,500
Dear...!

989
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:25,333
-Did you call me?
-Yeah!

990
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,500
I'm really scared.

991
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,375
Please hold my hands
and take me from here.

992
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,333
Why just hands, will put
my arms around you,

993
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,167
hey you're taking advantage
of the situation.

994
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:49,667
Hey who stopped the running
water, while I'm taking bath.

995
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:52,250
Hey, who the hell is taking
a bath at this hour?

996
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:55,583
Oh no! It's a Ghost!

997
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:56,917
Ghost! Ghost!

998
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:58,792
Oh no!, it's holding my pants.

999
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:01,500
It hasn't left I believe.

1000
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:02,500
Cotton is screaming.

1001
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:03,625
Cotton is done for now.

1002
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:04,958
I'm coming damn it.

1003
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,917
Hey Ganesh!

1004
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:07,333
Vaishu! Balki!

1005
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,167
Hey, come on.

1006
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:11,167
Hey Balki, come and
save me from the ghost.

1007
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:12,708
Hey Ganesh!

1008
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,667
Hey Ganesha!

1009
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,208
Hey Balki, run faster.

1010
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,500
-Hey
-Ghost is holding me from back.

1011
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,417
-What happened?
-Cotton!

1012
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:18,542
What happened Cotton?

1013
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:20,125
-It's the Ghost
-Ghost is in the bathroom too?

1014
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,000
-Where's it?
-It's inside.

1015
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:22,917
Inside!?

1016
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:23,917
Flash the light and check.

1017
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:24,333
Come outside.

1018
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:26,417
Why aren't you coming outside,
is it pulling your hands?

1019
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:27,625
Bloody, shut up!

1020
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:31,000
Hey, there's nothing
inside here.

1021
00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:31,625
Move away.

1022
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,125
Nothing!? Look it's
been holding my pants.

1023
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:35,375
Nothing it seems.

1024
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,167
Hey idiot!

1025
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:38,583
Your pant is stuck to the hook.

1026
00:49:38,917 --> 00:49:39,917
A hook!?

1027
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:41,167
Ghost is pulling him it seems.

1028
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:43,125
This ghost thing is
becoming too much.

1029
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:43,875
Go and sleep.

1030
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:45,542
Look at your mangled face.

1031
00:49:46,042 --> 00:49:47,750
Have to call for the Iyer in the
morning get the house blessed.

1032
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:48,458
Go on!

1033
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:49,833
Did you really see it?

1034
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:52,750
How did the light go off?

1035
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,292
It's confusing!

1036
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:59,792
[PRAYER]

1037
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:02,750
[PRAYER]

1038
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,750
Lord Ganesha, bless us all.

1039
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,208
God please bless my
wife with good wisdom.

1040
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,458
God of courage, save us.

1041
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:11,625
I've never seen such
a prayer till date.

1042
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:12,417
If you've done it,
will know about it.

1043
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:14,083
This is the first time for me.

1044
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:15,208
Yes Vaishu.

1045
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:17,875
I haven't seen Madhu inside
the Pooja Room before.

1046
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:19,542
This is the first time, I'm so happy.

1047
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,500
Drink without spilling it.

1048
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,833
Now that Vaishu is here, the
house will be filled with joy.

1049
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:25,458
Vaishu is a very lucky girl.

1050
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:27,625
It's 'cause of her, I'm
going to get married.

1051
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:28,667
-Oh!
-Yes Vaishu.

1052
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:31,500
If at all your luck
blesses us with a child,

1053
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:33,000
I'll be really happy.

1054
00:50:33,042 --> 00:50:33,917
What do you say Madhu?

1055
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:35,167
What's the hurry? Just shut up.

1056
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:37,250
I've been useless
all this while.

1057
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:39,250
Fine, today is an
auspicious day.

1058
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:40,583
Can someone blow this shell?

1059
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,375
-Give it to elders.
-Give it to him.

1060
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:43,833
-Balki you do it.
-Sure I'll do.

1061
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,250
Hey tighten it and
blow the shell.

1062
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,500
If do that, will lose my breath.

1063
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:48,583
Let it go!

1064
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:51,417
He doesn't seem to blow it,
just the air hissing out.

1065
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,667
I'm not able to,
why don't you try?

1066
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,542
I've never blown a shell.

1067
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:57,750
So you've stopped now.

1068
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:58,792
You did, so did I.

1069
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,042
Vaishu, you please
blow the shell.

1070
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:02,667
He's old, so you do it.

1071
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:03,667
Do it Vaishu.

1072
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:52,958
He doesn't look
like a local guy.

1073
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,250
We definitely need to get
these people out of here,

1074
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:57,542
they're tampering
with crime scene.

1075
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:08,708
No one can deny that.

1076
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:10,375
Excuse me Sir! I
have a bad news.

1077
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:12,417
-What!?
-Alex is no more.

1078
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:13,917
-Somebody murdered him.
-What!?

1079
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,167
Police is looking for them.

1080
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,417
They'll find the killer soon.

1081
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,167
Before police gets
to the killer,

1082
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,958
I need to know who
committed this murder.

1083
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,125
You personally follow this case.

1084
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:24,625
-Sure Sir.
-Ok!?

1085
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:26,250
-Ok Sir, I'll take care of it.
-Go!

1086
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,333
So I was saying....

1087
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:39,375
[VEDIC CHANTS]

1088
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:52,250
Come in Swami.

1089
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,000
Ganesh has made all
the arrangements.

1090
00:56:54,042 --> 00:56:55,375
You can start the prayers.

1091
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,333
Swami, why are you looking at this
house, as it's your first time?

1092
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:01,083
There's some kind of
change in the house.

1093
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,417
Ah! What! What are you saying?

1094
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:04,750
Who else is inside the house?

1095
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:06,417
Gather everyone.

1096
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:07,792
I need to see them.

1097
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:10,208
-Ganesh.
-Uh!?

1098
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,250
-Ganesh
-I'm coming.

1099
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,250
He's omnipresent.

1100
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:14,958
There's something which is
not right in this house.

1101
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,083
You're right Swami.

1102
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:18,292
We haven't even brushed our
teeth for two as we're scared.

1103
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:19,208
Did you run out of toothpaste?

1104
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,458
Hey shut up.

1105
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:23,667
Swami, what's not right.

1106
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,167
There's an evil force
inside this house.

1107
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:26,750
I think he was
talking about you.

1108
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,208
You guys have to
be really careful.

1109
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:32,083
Oh no Swami, I thought my
wife was the evil force,

1110
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:35,125
but I've seen worst
ghosts than her.

1111
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:36,750
-Hey!
-Did you see that?

1112
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:37,667
He's right Swami.

1113
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,875
Looks like something has been
scaring us in the house.

1114
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:41,292
You should help us with it.

1115
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,958
Don't worry, I'll hex a
thread and give it to you.

1116
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Ok Swami.

1117
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,500
Tie them in the four corners.

1118
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:47,958
Until it's around you
guys won't be harmed.

1119
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,917
Ok Swami.

1120
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:50,083
Thanks a lot Swami.

1121
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:19,792
[MANTRAS]

1122
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,208
I'll hex and give it to you.

1123
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,542
Tie them in the four corners.

1124
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:27,125
Until it's around you
guys won't be harmed.

1125
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:31,667
Ganesh have you closed
all the windows?

1126
00:58:32,042 --> 00:58:34,000
I came to bed only after
closing them all.

1127
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,583
Remove them all.

1128
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:38,083
Is it working out?

1129
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:39,458
Remove the string...

1130
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,250
looks like my darling
is in great mood.

1131
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:42,708
How can I say no,
when you have asked.

1132
00:58:43,083 --> 00:58:45,125
I'm here, and have removed them.

1133
00:58:45,917 --> 00:58:47,083
I'm ready...Oh God!

1134
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,208
Stupid, what are
you doing buffalo?

1135
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:50,583
-You were the one asked to remove
-What!?

1136
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:51,375
When did I ask to?

1137
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:53,000
I asked to remove the string,

1138
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:54,667
but you guys are not removing.

1139
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,792
Ganesh this sounds like
a different voice.

1140
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:00,250
What if this is the Ghost?

1141
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:01,958
How can it be when you're here.

1142
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I asked to remove it and
you're kidding with me.

1143
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,792
-Oh God!
-Now you want to fall on my feet.

1144
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:09,625
Open the door, open it!

1145
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:11,375
The latch doesn't
seem to come off.

1146
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,417
Why are you pushing me away.

1147
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:15,042
Hey the ghost is getting closer.

1148
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,542
Hey help me too get out.

1149
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:17,292
Oh God!

1150
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:19,708
Look at her run stepping on me.

1151
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,000
There's a ghost inside
another is here running

1152
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:24,458
I'm stuck in between them.

1153
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:26,625
Someone please help me...

1154
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:29,167
You guys look scared,
like you've seen a ghost,

1155
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:29,833
Ghost is inside.

1156
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,875
We're not running scared, but running
to escape the beating from the Ghost.

1157
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:35,583
You must've been watching
a horror movie on TV,

1158
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:37,958
and in that a ghost might have slapped,
you guys are scared looking at it.

1159
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,458
Oh God!

1160
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:43,917
Now you must know how it feels
to get beaten by a ghost.

1161
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:46,292
Hey it felt like
someone beat me up.

1162
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,083
it's the same ghost
which whacked us both.

1163
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,167
This is called the
Ghost massage.

1164
00:59:50,167 --> 00:59:51,458
Remove the string, damn it.

1165
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:53,125
Can just hear the voice,
but can't see it.

1166
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:53,833
Oh this string.

1167
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:55,958
I removed it, I removed it!

1168
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:57,667
Madhu is this fine?

1169
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,958
How dare you removed your
shorts in front of my wife.

1170
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:04,000
Hey, the Ghost asked
to remove it.

1171
01:00:04,042 --> 01:00:05,500
I can't take more
beatings from the ghost.

1172
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,667
Hey remove that string given
by Swami immediately.

1173
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,708
Which string is that?

1174
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,208
Bloody asking for a doubt,

1175
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:11,625
remove that string damn it.

1176
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:12,708
She has started.

1177
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,208
There's a reason for
the Ghost to beat me,

1178
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:17,958
Why the hell is your
wife, beating me up?

1179
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:20,333
Let's ponder on this later,

1180
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:21,917
first let's finish
this Ghost business.

1181
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:23,875
Remove that string
and throw it away.

1182
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:24,750
String!?

1183
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:25,875
The one which Swami gave.

1184
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:27,500
Oh this one.

1185
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:28,833
Look here,

1186
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,625
lift it up and show
it to the ghost.

1187
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:32,458
Just like you said,
I've removed it.

1188
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:35,708
Here on for any reason, you
shouldn't just beat me up...

1189
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:38,958
We threw it to the Ghost
and this Troll caught it.

1190
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:40,417
Hey Cotton throw that out.

1191
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:42,250
Hey, what's this?

1192
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:44,417
You're playing the string
given by the Swami.

1193
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:45,875
We're not, it's the
Ghost who's playing.

1194
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,250
Didn't he say if you wear this
Ghost won't come near you.

1195
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,333
Then why are you
throwing this away.

1196
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:49,208
Useless buggers.

1197
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,875
Hey, why are you guys
getting worked up?

1198
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:52,708
Ghost! It's behind you.

1199
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:55,375
Hey, I used to play
basket ball with Ghosts.

1200
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:56,708
And you're scaring me!?

1201
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:57,833
Ghost!?

1202
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:59,542
Is it behind me?

1203
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,958
Let's see if it can face me?

1204
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:03,292
That was quick.

1205
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:04,542
What is your name?

1206
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:09,792
Oh God!

1207
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,750
Once you used to play basket
ball with the ghosts.

1208
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:14,500
Now it played you as a football.

1209
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:15,750
I just played one game.

1210
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:17,792
Who knew it'll kick
me in the air.

1211
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:18,958
Cut those strings
and throw it away.

1212
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,125
-Hey, What!?
-Throw them Damn it.

1213
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,292
Hey no bad words.

1214
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:23,833
Can you please
show me your back?

1215
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:26,167
How can you talk so low to me?

1216
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,417
Hey everyone is
misinterpreting my language.

1217
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:30,000
It's on your back, turn around.

1218
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:30,792
Look there!

1219
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:33,000
On top of it this ghost.

1220
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:34,042
Remove it quick.

1221
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,125
Why are you scratching
me for that?

1222
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,250
Hey, remove and throw it away.

1223
01:01:37,292 --> 01:01:39,458
Hey throw that string
away, throw it away.

1224
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,292
Throw it sooner.

1225
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,125
Hey, where's the another string.

1226
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:44,792
Another one!?

1227
01:01:44,792 --> 01:01:46,083
One, Two, Three...

1228
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:47,417
Hey, where's your string?

1229
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:48,083
Where's it?

1230
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:50,667
My waist chain was tight
so I used it to extend it

1231
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:52,042
disgusting grown like a buffalo
and still wears a waist chain.

1232
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,083
It's not here, it's
in the cupboard.

1233
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:55,875
Bloody what are you doing here,
keep that in the cupboard.

1234
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,417
Go and take it.

1235
01:01:57,417 --> 01:01:58,417
Go faster...

1236
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:00,167
...not sure where I kept it.

1237
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,708
Hey where did you keep it.

1238
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:03,083
I kept it in this cupboard.

1239
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,375
It's a fridge, not a cupboard.

1240
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:06,417
Said that out of panic.

1241
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:07,500
I kept it somewhere around here.

1242
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:09,125
I kept the empty bottle here.

1243
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,833
then removed the shorts and
kept it inside the fridge.

1244
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:11,875
What are you guys still doing?

1245
01:02:11,875 --> 01:02:13,500
Ey! this is soooo good.

1246
01:02:13,542 --> 01:02:15,333
Beautiful, hold me tighter.

1247
01:02:15,375 --> 01:02:16,833
Hold your horses, let me enjoy

1248
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:17,917
either ways you're
not doing anything.

1249
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:19,417
-You continue
-Madhu!!!

1250
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:21,333
Damn, can't believe
I hugged him.

1251
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:21,875
Didn't know you liked me.

1252
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:22,917
What's with the romantic look.

1253
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:25,167
Fearing the Ghost, I
hugged a wild buffalo.

1254
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:27,792
Damn, shouldn't
trust these women.

1255
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:29,958
I imagined a different
scenario when you'll vomit.

1256
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:32,125
but you're here vomiting
in this situation.

1257
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:34,042
Disgusting, how worse
your imagination is.

1258
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:35,500
I found out.

1259
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,083
-Where!?
-Here!

1260
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,958
Here uh!

1261
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,083
I meant to say not there.

1262
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:40,708
then where is it?

1263
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,667
It's on my waist, who asked
you to come jump in haste.

1264
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:43,458
Come on get up.

1265
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,125
Throw it away.

1266
01:02:44,167 --> 01:02:45,667
Hey come on, take it and go.

1267
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:48,125
-All the strings are thrown
-You've become a nuisance.

1268
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:49,833
If you comeback again,
will break your jaw.

1269
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:57,625
Just watch a pig
coming out the grill.

1270
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,167
Oh God, it's a PIG roast.

1271
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:10,417
He's been praying for an hour.

1272
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,708
If the ghost has beaten you up,

1273
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,792
Then it must be really angry.

1274
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,500
It's very aggressive.

1275
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,292
Aggressive!?

1276
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:19,667
The Ghost and I have no problem.

1277
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:21,250
I watch a lot of horror films.

1278
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,583
I don't fear the Ghost,
as I like them a lot.

1279
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:25,708
-You like them?
-Yes father.

1280
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:27,917
He's the chief of
Ghosts Fan Club.

1281
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:29,417
-What's it?
-Both of you just shut up.

1282
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,500
Father, you should help us drive
the ghost away from our house.

1283
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:35,125
Can you please help
us with something.

1284
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:36,292
If that's the case,

1285
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:39,042
we have to find out,
who it has possessed.

1286
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:42,250
Father, we know how to go
about blood and urine test.

1287
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:45,417
How do we test, that
who it has possessed?

1288
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,458
Hold on a minute.

1289
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:48,208
Hey, where's he going?

1290
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:50,167
I think even he's scared.

1291
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:56,458
He's the best among
the ghost-busters,

1292
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:57,583
so he will demand
a higher payment.

1293
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,875
What is he bringing in that cup?

1294
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:00,375
-Take this.
-What's this Father?

1295
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:01,375
There's powder in it.

1296
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:04,292
Father, we wanted to drive the ghost
away and you're giving us powder.

1297
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:06,625
What are we going to do
with powder and the Ghost?

1298
01:04:06,667 --> 01:04:07,917
This is holy powder.

1299
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:10,333
If you apply this to the
person who's possessed

1300
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:12,000
it'll reflect it's real image.

1301
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:13,875
Then why don't you
do it right here.

1302
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,292
-No...no!
-Are you scared father?

1303
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:18,250
Take this and put it, where the
ghost is actually present.

1304
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:20,000
Only then we'll know
who it has possessed.

1305
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,875
Great escape.

1306
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:23,667
Only after that, we can
think of driving it away.

1307
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:25,125
Then ask her to apply it first.

1308
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:26,875
She's the one who always
wears powder on her face.

1309
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:27,875
Hey, what's it?

1310
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:28,917
How can you be disrespectful?

1311
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:29,917
I'm being nice, 'cause
Father is here.

1312
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:30,542
Don't be!

1313
01:04:30,542 --> 01:04:31,542
Ask sorry to Madhu.

1314
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:33,708
How can I ask for one, she
wears jeans all the time.

1315
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,250
Hey, can you guys
please shut up.

1316
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:36,042
Look how she's managing it

1317
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:39,292
Give me that Father, we'll try
this on everyone once we get home.

1318
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,875
Jesus, God bless you!

1319
01:04:40,917 --> 01:04:42,792
Father you're on my
feet, take it away.

1320
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:47,083
Hey Man, last night I met
this girl at the party

1321
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:48,667
she was damn nice.

1322
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:52,167
we were just hanging
and had fun all night.

1323
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,333
Hey look at that.

1324
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:55,417
I've seen her somewhere.

1325
01:04:58,125 --> 01:04:59,500
Hey that girl I know her.

1326
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:00,250
Oh yeah!?

1327
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,042
I've seen this girl
from somewhere.

1328
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,208
Hey come here...

1329
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,125
...stop, stop, stop.

1330
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:08,083
Don't worry,

1331
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:09,625
we just going to have
some fun come on babe,

1332
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:11,458
hey are you horny honey?

1333
01:05:11,583 --> 01:05:12,250
Don't touch me.

1334
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:13,500
Come on babe.

1335
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:17,125
Hey...Hey...let go off me.

1336
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:18,542
Help! Help!

1337
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:19,750
Have fun buddy.

1338
01:05:19,792 --> 01:05:21,333
-Leave me
-I'll wait for my turn.

1339
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,917
Let me go damn it, let me go.

1340
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:23,833
Oh you're so light.

1341
01:05:23,875 --> 01:05:26,417
Help! Hey just let go off me.

1342
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:28,833
Help! Help! Help!

1343
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:30,500
[RECITING PRAYER]

1344
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,000
[RECITING PRAYER]

1345
01:05:32,042 --> 01:05:33,750
Who do we start testing on?

1346
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:34,792
Put it on your husband.

1347
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:35,917
I'm really scared.

1348
01:05:35,917 --> 01:05:37,292
We'll close our eyes.

1349
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,833
and apply the power
on our faces.

1350
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:41,167
We'll find out who the
ghost has possessed.

1351
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,958
Fine, Ok.

1352
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,458
Put it on!

1353
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:45,250
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!

1354
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:50,833
When I open my eyes, I
wish I'm not the ghost.

1355
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:55,917
Why are you guys screaming?

1356
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:57,417
Ghost, you're the ghost.

1357
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:58,917
Hey why are you screaming?

1358
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:00,667
You're a Ghost! You're a Ghost!
You're a Ghost!

1359
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,292
So all four of us
are not possessed.

1360
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:04,708
If none of us are possessed,

1361
01:06:04,792 --> 01:06:06,000
then who's the ghost?

1362
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:10,500
Oh my god!

1363
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:13,917
-We need to call for back up
-Ok we'll do it.

1364
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,125
and record the statement.

1365
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,333
Oh my God it's horrible.

1366
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,833
So these are the two guys.

1367
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:19,250
let's see what we can
get out of them.

1368
01:06:19,292 --> 01:06:20,042
Hello chaps, you alright?

1369
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,042
Alright Sir!

1370
01:06:21,542 --> 01:06:22,417
Can you tell us what you saw?

1371
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,542
I'm actually pretty
good at drawing.

1372
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,125
I remember what she looks like.

1373
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:27,167
I can make a drawing.

1374
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:29,583
While he's doing that, can
you tell us more about her.

1375
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:31,542
I think she's Asian or Indian.

1376
01:06:31,542 --> 01:06:33,000
I don't know exactly.

1377
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:35,292
They've given me
such a huge bible.

1378
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:37,833
It's in English and
I can't understand

1379
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:41,083
Oh God, please somehow
save me from this Ghost.

1380
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:44,250
We've checked the entire
house with the powder.

1381
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:45,458
The ghost doesn't seem to be here.

1382
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,833
Don't get too relaxed,

1383
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:48,208
I'm still not convinced.

1384
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,583
-On who?
-The Ghost.

1385
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:50,958
Don't be talking nonsense.

1386
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:51,583
Don't keep scaring.

1387
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:52,625
What's your doubt?

1388
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:56,125
What if the ghost was under
the sheets sleeping,

1389
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:57,125
If we put the
powder during that,

1390
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:58,625
how it would've fallen on it.

1391
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:00,042
You and your stupid doubts.

1392
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:00,833
Come on Madhu let's
wash our faces.

1393
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:01,667
Grown up to be useless.

1394
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,917
Damn it's still in my hands,
Madhu I'm coming too.

1395
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:16,333
Does anybody else knows
about this, in this area?

1396
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,542
No I don't think so.

1397
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:20,542
Take a look.

1398
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:22,667
This is the girl!?

1399
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:23,625
Ya that's the girl.

1400
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:24,958
-Can I have a look?
-Ya sure.

1401
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:31,250
No that can't be right,
I know this girl.

1402
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,917
She went missing two years ago.

1403
01:07:32,917 --> 01:07:34,083
No no, that's her.

1404
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:35,875
It's not possible.

1405
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:36,792
Are you Sure mate?

1406
01:07:36,792 --> 01:07:38,208
I'm positive, I worked the case.

1407
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,750
Tell me exactly what happened?

1408
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,208
Help! Help!

1409
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:46,625
Help!

1410
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:48,333
-Help!
-Come on.

1411
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,583
Come on Baby!

1412
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,458
If you don't, then I'll
show you the blood.

1413
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:58,167
Bloody come here.

1414
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:26,750
YOU!

1415
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,417
What are you looking at?

1416
01:09:05,667 --> 01:09:08,375
What's happening,
it keeps changing.

1417
01:09:08,417 --> 01:09:09,542
Oh God!

1418
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:10,750
Is she the ghost?

1419
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:14,083
Vaishu!?

1420
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:15,667
Vishnavi!

1421
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,417
I'm not Vaishnavi,

1422
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:19,958
MOHINI!

1423
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,708
I N T E R V A L

1424
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:45,875
Sir, we're not
able to bend down,

1425
01:09:45,917 --> 01:09:47,542
please sir, only you
can try and save us.

1426
01:09:47,542 --> 01:09:49,667
You're saying a ghost
is making a trouble?

1427
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:50,542
Yes Sir!

1428
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:51,917
Ghost is a big trouble.

1429
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:53,625
One girl, two character roles.

1430
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:55,333
If she whacks us, it
feels like 2 tonne

1431
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:56,708
It keeps beating us,
please help us.

1432
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:58,292
Why don't you go and
see a church father?

1433
01:09:58,333 --> 01:10:00,542
It was him, who got us more
in trouble with the Ghost.

1434
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:01,708
He took the money though.

1435
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:02,833
He's a biggest fraud.

1436
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:04,042
-Really!?
-Help us, Sir please.

1437
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,500
I'll buy you drinks,
please arrest that ghost.

1438
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,917
Ok, Ok, come let's go.

1439
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:08,750
Come on everyone sit inside.

1440
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:10,542
Drinks work everywhere.

1441
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:11,542
Welcome to Ghost House Sir.

1442
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:12,542
Sure!

1443
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,125
Where's the Ghost?

1444
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:15,667
Ghost is inside, Sir.

1445
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:17,875
Inside!? Come inside,
show me the Ghost.

1446
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:19,458
No, No, No...we'll
be here, right here.

1447
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,500
Come show me the Ghost.

1448
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,167
You bloody get in, why do
you want us to get more.

1449
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:23,542
-You get in.
-Get in Damn it!

1450
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:24,708
Even they're scared I think.

1451
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:27,667
-Hello Madam.
-Hello Madam.

1452
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:28,208
Hello!

1453
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:30,250
I guess some people
are scared of Ghosts.

1454
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,292
-Ghost!?
-Ya.

1455
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:32,625
-In this house?
-Yeah!

1456
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:35,000
Impossible, there's
nothing I can assure you.

1457
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:36,125
Can we have a look inside?

1458
01:10:36,125 --> 01:10:37,750
Ya sure why not, come on.

1459
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:39,042
Trust me it's fake.

1460
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,542
-We've been wasting our time,
-Sorry Ma'am

1461
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:42,208
-Thank you for your time
-No problem.

1462
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:43,167
-Thank you.
-That's Ok.

1463
01:10:43,542 --> 01:10:45,500
I thought they'll get beaten up,
but they seemed to be smiling.

1464
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:48,292
There's no ghost in there,
only a beautiful lady inside.

1465
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:51,125
Hey, she's the Ghost, and
you were drooling at her.

1466
01:10:51,333 --> 01:10:52,417
Don't waste our time again.

1467
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:53,750
-Waste of time uh!?
-They're leaving

1468
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,333
Hey Balki, come inside.

1469
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:58,583
Balki she's calling
you, come on go.

1470
01:10:58,625 --> 01:10:59,875
It's not that Vaishu,

1471
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:02,958
I'm sweating inside
due to the cold,

1472
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:03,292
What!?

1473
01:11:03,292 --> 01:11:06,250
and outside, it's like raining
wind and seating too.

1474
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,167
Hey didn't you wanted
to use the rest room?

1475
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:09,125
Come on get inside.

1476
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:11,292
I'm practicing Jalsa
dance, shut up

1477
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,708
What are you guys blabbering?

1478
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,250
Madhu at least you come inside.

1479
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:15,708
Madhu uh!? Who's that?

1480
01:11:15,875 --> 01:11:17,708
Hey Ganesh, save me damn it.

1481
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,292
Is this Pakistan? Are
your selling explosives?

1482
01:11:19,292 --> 01:11:21,250
-Hi Guys,
-Who's that?

1483
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:22,042
Hello!

1484
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:23,667
Welcome, Ghost's boy friend.

1485
01:11:23,708 --> 01:11:25,417
Why does everyone
look so worked up?

1486
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:27,333
We were playing a game.

1487
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,042
We do exercise,

1488
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:30,625
jogging and Ghilli Dhandu

1489
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:31,333
That's nice.

1490
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:32,292
Nice!? Only when you
experience it you'll know.

1491
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:33,583
I don't get time
for all of this.

1492
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:34,875
-Come dear.
-Oh Hi.

1493
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:36,208
-Hi!
-Are you free now?

1494
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,167
Why do you ask?

1495
01:11:37,375 --> 01:11:39,292
Nothing much, there's
a surprise party.

1496
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:40,542
So came to take you for that.

1497
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,250
Vaishu is free as a bird.

1498
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:43,708
For God sake take her along.

1499
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:44,417
Please take her.

1500
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:45,917
It'll great if there's
a party daily.

1501
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,625
Why not!

1502
01:11:46,625 --> 01:11:48,042
Just give me 5 minutes,
I'll change and come.

1503
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:50,208
-So wassup,
-This shirt is nice on you.

1504
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:52,167
You're wearing nice
shoes yourself man.

1505
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:53,167
That's my selection.

1506
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:54,875
It was taken off the platforms.

1507
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:55,708
You were talking about
the shoes right?

1508
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,000
Hey can you guys shut up?

1509
01:11:57,042 --> 01:11:57,958
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

1510
01:11:58,042 --> 01:11:58,833
she's coming.

1511
01:11:58,875 --> 01:12:00,000
Why don't you join us?

1512
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,500
It's ok you carry on.

1513
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,125
Cotton and Balki, you
guys come along too,

1514
01:12:03,167 --> 01:12:03,958
for what?

1515
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:05,958
Food in these parties
will be great.

1516
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,167
You both are fond of food,

1517
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:08,917
Come.

1518
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:11,667
My stomach is upset
and making noises.

1519
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:12,583
Why don't you take him?

1520
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:17,250
Hey Vaishu, I've prepped to make
Pongal, when you return can have it

1521
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,417
Why are you getting me caught?

1522
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,042
I said come on.

1523
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,958
The tone is changing.

1524
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:24,750
Sandeep can we go shopping
before the party.

1525
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,500
Of Course Vaishu.

1526
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:26,917
Vaishu for us too.

1527
01:12:30,792 --> 01:12:34,083
Balki and Cotton, shouldn't
steal the cutlery from here.

1528
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:38,583
Wasn't he with us, but
is all suited up.

1529
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:39,208
Hi!

1530
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:41,000
Balki, keep your
bumper mouth shut.

1531
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:42,167
Hi Vaishnavi!

1532
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,833
-How are you?
-I'm good.

1533
01:12:43,917 --> 01:12:45,375
Sandeep introduce to everyone.

1534
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:46,667
Get the Ghost introduced

1535
01:12:46,667 --> 01:12:47,833
I can't find my brand here.

1536
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:49,417
Guys, let's have some fun.

1537
01:12:50,042 --> 01:12:50,833
Come on!

1538
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:53,375
What's this? he invited us to the
party and just offering a bun.

1539
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:55,250
That's not bun, it's Fun.

1540
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:57,500
He's asking us all to be happy.

1541
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,458
English!

1542
01:12:58,542 --> 01:12:59,125
Hello Friends!

1543
01:12:59,167 --> 01:13:00,625
-Who's this Dog Voice?
-Who's that?

1544
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:06,042
I have something really important
to share with all you people.

1545
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:10,583
Did he forget?

1546
01:13:10,917 --> 01:13:12,292
I'm going to propose.

1547
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:18,833
Vaishu!

1548
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:21,208
Will you marry me?

1549
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,417
He'll be the first to
propose to a ghost.

1550
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,583
Sandeep...

1551
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:32,958

that I've earned
this entire wealth,

1609
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:20,500

1611
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:27,042
These are its documents.

1612
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:33,875
To my Son,

-Take it.
-Thank you.

1616
01:17:45,917 --> 01:17:49,458
Sandeep, you're going
to be a life changer.

1617
01:18:01,167 --> 01:18:03,708
I'm getting too high, did they
mix our local liquor in it.

1618
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:04,833
Great that you guys
are having fun.

1619
01:18:04,917 --> 01:18:06,792
My eyes have gone blurry.

1620
01:18:06,792 --> 01:18:09,042
Check how my wife looks
when you're drunk.

1621
01:18:10,042 --> 01:18:10,917
You call that a face?

1622
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:12,667
Che...no comments.

1623
01:18:12,708 --> 01:18:14,125
My Madhu looks really hot!

1624
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:16,625

1625
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:17,667

1627
01:18:20,417 --> 01:18:20,958

1632
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:16,542

1633
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:18,417

1634
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:20,083
Sandeep...somebody...

1635
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:23,458
somebody was trying to kill me.

1636
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:25,625
Somebody tried to kill me.

1637
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:28,958
Somebody tried to kill me!

1638
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:29,625
Someone is here.

1639
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:31,583
Dad there's no one here.
see no one is here.

1640
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:32,083
No!

1641
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,500
You're way too drunk.

1642
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:35,167
Come on let's go.

1643
01:19:35,292 --> 01:19:36,333
-Come on!
-Somebody tried to kill me

1644
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:38,292
-you're just too drunk dad
-No Sandeep.

1645
01:19:38,417 --> 01:19:40,167
We've been drinking Orange
juice instead of alcohol.

1646
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:42,042
Dad I'll go to Canada
meeting instead of you.

1647
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:43,500
When I'm back, I'll
take you to the doctor.

1648
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,625
Somebody tried to kill me.

1650
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:47,667
Dad you're just drunk.

1651
01:19:47,792 --> 01:19:49,833
Vaishu has tried
killing Sandeep's Dad.

1652
01:19:50,208 --> 01:19:52,958
Wonder what's the reason, that Vaishu
is about to kill her Father in law.

1653
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:55,833
Don't know why she's
so angry with him.

1654
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,625
TWO YEARS AGO!

1655

1677
01:21:48,042 --> 01:21:48,792

1682
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,208
This kid is fine for
tonight's Pooja at the site.

1683
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:05,792
Ok Boss, if there's anything else,

1685
01:22:58,167 --> 01:23:01,042
Lara you said this pile work of
SEC-D will be completed last night

1686
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:02,125
Why it isn't completed?

1687
01:23:02,167 --> 01:23:03,250
The night shift didn't
work last night.

1688
01:23:03,292 --> 01:23:05,958
They asked us to leave, as they were
conducting a Pooja with School kids.

1689
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,042

You haven't selected a kid to
sacrifice for our site Pooja.

01:23:38,417 --> 01:23:39,417
-Excuse me
-Uh!

1695
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:57,625

Come select what you want.

1718
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:22,167
Ah...you can select

1719
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:24,583
Watch them Danny.

1720
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,667
We don't want to be here,
they're hurting us.

1721
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:00,000
Ssshhhh!

1722
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:05,375
It's hurting Madam, please
give us some water.

1723
01:28:33,083 --> 01:28:34,250
No, No, No!

1724
01:28:49,042 --> 01:28:51,458
From the information given
by Architect Mohini,

1725
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:55,292
Alex the head of child
trafficking gang,

1726
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:58,583
was arrested by the
England Police.

1727
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,375
Human Sacrifice, Violent killings,

1728
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:03,042
Human Trafficking and many
other illegal business

1729
01:29:03,083 --> 01:29:04,667
In order to sell them

1730
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:07,583
the kids who were kidnapped
from all over the world,

1731
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:11,250
were recovered and
saved by the Police.

1732
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:14,208
In addition to this, all the
construction sites of KVR,

1733
01:29:14,292 --> 01:29:16,708
the remains of the kids
who were sacrificed

1734
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:19,792
arrangements are made
to dig them out.

1735
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:28,542
Come on, Come on.

1736
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:29,875
Go, go!

1737
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:18,833
Doctor, you've done an extensive
research on Human Sacrifice,

1738
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:22,333
what's the nasty thought process
and motive of this horrific act,

1739
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,708
The sole reason for human
sacrifice is superstition.

1740
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:27,125
Growth in business.

1741
01:30:27,208 --> 01:30:28,750
To live longer.

1742
01:30:28,792 --> 01:30:30,167
To gain wizardry,

1743
01:30:30,292 --> 01:30:31,292
finding a treasure.

1744
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:33,875
Like this, everyone
pick one such reason,

1745
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:35,708
to perform such act.

1746
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:36,750
What nonsense!

1747
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:38,750
Such beliefs in this age.

1748
01:30:38,792 --> 01:30:42,792
It's not just now, this has
been happening for ages.

1749
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:47,125
back in days to win a war,
human sacrifices were given.

1750
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:50,583
In fact, to gain victory
in Kurukshetra,

1751
01:30:50,583 --> 01:30:57,208
Aravan, Son of Arjunan who was blessed with
32 chiromantic features was sacrificed.

1752
01:30:57,542 --> 01:30:58,375
Kala Bali!?

1753
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:00,083
God Sacrifices, Human Sacrifices

1754
01:31:00,083 --> 01:31:03,375
In the name of such actions, at
Quarries, construction building...

1755
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:04,958
also many other places.

1756
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,333
These kind of atrocities are
continuously happening.

1757
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:09,542
Recently in India
at a stone quarry,

1758
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:12,583
an investigation is
going on such a case.

1759
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:15,375
What's the solution to stop
this barbaric actions?

1760
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,708
Social Awareness.

1761
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:17,417
Ah!

1762
01:31:17,792 --> 01:31:19,333
We have a warrant
for you arrest.

1763
01:31:20,417 --> 01:31:20,875
What!?

1764
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:22,292
You have the right
to remain silent.

1765
01:31:33,458 --> 01:31:35,083
Mom he's that Rascal.

1766
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:37,208
Dear, why do we have to
indulge in such issues.

1767
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:38,333
God will take care of it.

1768
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:41,083
Mom, all of them
were small children.

1769
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:43,000
They've killed them without mercy.

1770
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:45,708
He doesn't have
any fear for God.

1771
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:47,917
He's a beast, a barbaric beast!

1772
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,500
Don't get angry dear.

1773
01:31:49,958 --> 01:31:51,833
The defendant Mr.KVR,

1774
01:31:51,833 --> 01:31:53,333
who is charged with
cruelty to persons,

1775
01:31:53,333 --> 01:31:58,000
under 16th Section 20/1 of Children
and Young Persons Act 1968

1776
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,458
I know that we will win.

1777
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,792
Sir, the Press is here.

1778
01:32:01,833 --> 01:32:03,292
I was sure this is
going to happen.

1779
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:05,458
Sir, what do you have to say about
the allegations against you.

1780
01:32:05,625 --> 01:32:07,542
Ok, Ok, Ok!

1781
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:09,042
I'll tell you.

1782
01:32:10,042 --> 01:32:11,250
Justice Prevailed!

1783
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:13,000
You know I'm innocent.

1784
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:14,833
It's a fabricated case.

1785
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:15,542
What!?

1786
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:17,250
That's why Honorable Judge,

1787
01:32:17,417 --> 01:32:18,625
just released me.

1788
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:20,417
I'm innocent and thank you.

1789
01:32:20,458 --> 01:32:21,333
Not guilty!

1790
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:23,542
Anyways thank you, no,
no, no more questions.

1791
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:25,625
Thanks, thanks, thanks a lot.

1792
01:32:25,667 --> 01:32:28,000
Mohini you worked so
hard to convict him,

1793
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:29,292
he got released like
it was nothing.

1794
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:31,042
I'll kill that bloody dog.

1795
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,250
Bujji Dear!

1796
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:48,667
Usually,

1797
01:32:49,542 --> 01:32:51,292
people who talk about
principles and justice,

1798
01:32:51,792 --> 01:32:52,792
either will be poor...

1799
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:56,000
...or will be a revolutionary.

1800
01:32:56,667 --> 01:32:58,208
But you're a woman.

1801
01:32:59,167 --> 01:33:00,583
Hey, what's your problem?

1802
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:03,500
People who sin either
will be in power,

1803
01:33:03,542 --> 01:33:05,583
or will be the richest.

1804
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:06,542
Just like you.

1805
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:10,708
So, you won't stop. Right!?

1806
01:33:11,333 --> 01:33:12,333
You wish!

1807
01:33:12,417 --> 01:33:13,750
I have to go to Prison,

1808
01:33:13,958 --> 01:33:15,333
hanged till death.

1809
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,375
For which you've met Supreme
Court Attorney General.

1810
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:24,500
You've met Parliament MP,

1811
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:30,250
and you've sent a lot
of emails to UNICEF.

1812
01:33:30,292 --> 01:33:32,250
You have mentioned a lot
of details about me.

1813
01:33:32,958 --> 01:33:34,417
I said the truth.

1814
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,333
Do you think I'm going to Jail?

1815
01:33:36,375 --> 01:33:38,667
Definitely, of course
you're going to jail.

1816
01:33:39,292 --> 01:33:40,458
No, no, no way!

1817
01:33:40,792 --> 01:33:43,875
Ay Mohini, there's a price for
everything in this world.

1818
01:33:44,792 --> 01:33:46,750
No matter how big my crime is,

1819
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:48,625
will get released in no time.

1820
01:33:48,917 --> 01:33:51,917
But you can't buy the
God, who's up there.

1821
01:33:52,667 --> 01:33:56,750
You can't easily escape the
punishment he'll have for you.

1822
01:33:57,708 --> 01:34:00,458
You! The God you've mentioned,

1823
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,667
has created those
children as well.

1824
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,583
Who are they? They're
born into this world,

1825
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,583
grow up,

1826
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:07,833
what are they going to become?

1827
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:10,875
Doctor, Engineer, Scientist?

1828
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:12,625
Or a Big Leader.

1829
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:14,333
Nothing!

1830
01:34:14,708 --> 01:34:18,250
If they don't have money, doesn't
matter if they're dead or alive.

1831
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:22,042
they're just like properties.

1832
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:25,000
They're no use in any
manner to anyone.

1833
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:28,125
That's why I used
them for my business.

1834
01:34:29,208 --> 01:34:29,958
That's all.

1835
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:32,917
They say God and
Children are the same.

1836
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:38,125
And people like you, who kill those
children are never going to change.

1837
01:34:39,125 --> 01:34:40,750
You'll never be forgiven.

1838
01:34:41,125 --> 01:34:42,500
I won't let you do this.

1839
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,833
If we have desired to win,

1840
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:50,917
the ones who stand
up against us,

1841
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:52,458
has to be killed like this.

1842
01:34:52,542 --> 01:34:53,417
Kill her!

1843
01:35:12,292 --> 01:35:15,375
You're going to die a gory
death splattered into pieces.

1844
01:35:15,958 --> 01:35:19,167
You're committing a
crime, let me go.

1845
01:35:21,208 --> 01:35:22,083
Let me go!

1846
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:23,458
Don't...

1847
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:25,542
...I did it for the
good of those children.

1848
01:35:27,417 --> 01:35:29,708
You're going to die without
anyone to give you last rites.

1849
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:32,667
You're doing a mistake,
a very grave mistake.

1850
01:35:33,125 --> 01:35:35,458
Even if you kill me,
I'll come back.

1851
01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:37,167
I will return.

1852
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,125
I will come!

1853
01:35:40,583 --> 01:35:42,292
Die! Die, damn it!

1854
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:44,792
Dispose her.

1855
01:36:04,083 --> 01:36:05,208
Goodbye Mohini.

1856
01:36:12,042 --> 01:36:13,000
Goodbye!

1857
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,500
Without a doubt, she's Mohini.

1858
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:11,875
How's it possible, even the
Police couldn't find the body.

1859
01:37:11,917 --> 01:37:12,667
Then how?

1860
01:37:12,708 --> 01:37:15,500
You killed her
body not her soul.

1861
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:18,333
Body is different from Soul.

1862
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:19,042
So!?

1863
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:21,417
You're saying that Mohini
has returned as a Spirit?

1864
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,083
Yes.

1865
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:23,875
To kill you.

1866
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:26,542
She has possessed a body
which looks just like her.

1867
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:27,833
Are you mad?

1868
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:29,958
How's that it
waited for 2 years,

1869
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:31,833
and found a body which
exactly looks like her.

1870
01:37:34,292 --> 01:37:36,542
I can't, I can't believe this.

1871
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,958
Can't get this ridiculous
bloody absurd theory.

1872
01:37:40,958 --> 01:37:44,708
The soul of the dead roams
the earth for a year.

1873
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:47,125
Once we finish the final rites,

1874
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:48,875
their soul rests in peace.

1875
01:37:49,542 --> 01:37:51,833
But Mohini died a violent death,

1876
01:37:52,292 --> 01:37:54,208
she's waiting to
avenge with violence.

1877
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:55,042
Ok!

1878
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:57,208
Let it be.

1879
01:37:58,375 --> 01:38:00,125
Even if Mohini
returned as a spirit,

1880
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:02,625
she could have
chosen another body.

1881
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:05,375
why did she choose a body
which looks just like her,

1882
01:38:06,125 --> 01:38:08,000
waited for 2 years

1883
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:09,750
How's that?

1884
01:38:10,042 --> 01:38:11,458
Even I have the same confusion.

1885
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:15,458
For these questions, answers can
be only found in Dharma Astrology.

1886
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,542
I have a friend in India,
who's an expert in this.

1887
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:19,375
We'll ask him.

1888
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,292
Greetings Monk, this is
Kannan Bhattacharya speaking.

1889
01:38:39,333 --> 01:38:41,042
From the details
you've given me,

1890
01:38:41,083 --> 01:38:42,625
around 200 years ago.

1891
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:46,042
Tirvandarum of the
Travancore territory,

1892
01:38:46,083 --> 01:38:48,292
Mohini hailed from
a family of cooks.

1893
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:55,000
As the time went by, Mohini's family
went in different directions.

1894
01:38:55,042 --> 01:38:56,958
From that one family
went overseas.

1895
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,792
And in that family,
Mohini was born.

1896
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:04,708
Five generations ago, Vaishnavi
and Mohini were born as twins.

1897
01:39:05,458 --> 01:39:07,958
In that life, they died
in a very gore manner,

1898
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:09,833
due to which the spirits
turned violent.

1899
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:13,625
Beyond that, when the blood
of their lineage was spilt,

1900
01:39:13,667 --> 01:39:17,042
the spirit which was around
Vaishnavi acquired great powers

1901
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:20,375
re-entered into the body which
looks exactly like her.

1902
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:23,208
And will fulfill its
desire to avenge.

1903
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,625
-Thanks a lot.
-You're welcome.

1904
01:39:30,208 --> 01:39:31,583
Unbelievable.

1905
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,417
In 21st century, Spirits
coming out and avenging,

1906
01:39:35,667 --> 01:39:37,208
It's hard to believe
in all this.

1907
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:38,583
It sounds really funny.

1908
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:41,750
You've done PhD. and
still believe this.

1909
01:39:41,792 --> 01:39:42,958
You didn't believe in Astrology.

1910
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:44,292
But will believe
in science right?

1911
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:45,333
Of course.

1912
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:49,292
KVR, have you heard Genetic
and Epi-Genetic theory?

1913
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:51,500
-No!
-Take this.

1914
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,792
Look at this.

1915
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:55,583
In simple terms,

1916
01:39:55,958 --> 01:39:57,667
if the son seems to
be short tempered,

1917
01:39:57,750 --> 01:39:59,792
it's sad he is
just like his Dad.

1918
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:02,875
they'll say my daughter
is just like her Mom.

1919
01:40:03,583 --> 01:40:05,458
Scientists went on and
did a research on it.

1920
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:09,750
It's called Trans generational
Epigenetic Inheritance Theory.

1921
01:40:09,917 --> 01:40:12,583
The ones who did research on
this are from Emory University,

1922
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:15,292
two scientists called Brian
Diaz and Kerry Russell.

1923
01:40:15,417 --> 01:40:17,042
The result of this research,

1924
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:18,583
even if you come past
the generations,

1925
01:40:18,667 --> 01:40:21,583
the relation to their DNA will
remain and will not change.

1926
01:40:21,625 --> 01:40:23,250
And that is true
in Mohini's case.

1927
01:40:24,625 --> 01:40:28,000
Vaishnavi's body DNA connection
has given Mohini full powers.

1928
01:40:29,583 --> 01:40:31,375
That's the reason, Mohini
waited for 2 years,

1929
01:40:31,833 --> 01:40:33,208
and made Vaishnavi
come to London.

1930
01:40:38,958 --> 01:40:40,500
Now you must've understood.

1931
01:40:42,375 --> 01:40:44,167
That Vaishnavi who has
turned into Mohini,

1932
01:40:44,417 --> 01:40:45,875
will definitely come
looking for you.

1933
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:00,167
Meneka!

1934
01:41:01,875 --> 01:41:03,958
Why were in such
an hurry to meet?

1935
01:41:04,042 --> 01:41:06,917
I'll tell you, who's that Vaishnavi
and how did she get here?

1936
01:41:07,875 --> 01:41:09,375
What's your aim and the plan?

1937
01:41:09,417 --> 01:41:10,417
Come on tell me.

1938
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:12,250
Vicky what are you
talking about?

1939
01:41:12,292 --> 01:41:13,208
I don't understand.

1940
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:14,125
You don't?

1941
01:41:14,833 --> 01:41:19,042
When we got divorced, I made
a settlement of 100 Crores.

1942
01:41:19,333 --> 01:41:20,667
Wasn't that enough for you?

1943
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,792
To clear the old scores and
with the intention of avenging,

1944
01:41:23,917 --> 01:41:27,292
you're trying to
swindle my property.

1945
01:41:27,458 --> 01:41:28,792
-Am I right!?
-Rubbish.

1946
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:29,875
What's wrong with you?

1947
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,333
-What court said...
-Hey!

1948
01:41:32,125 --> 01:41:34,125
I don't want to listen to
the bloody explanation.

1949
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:35,875
Where's Vaishnavi,

1950
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:37,583
just tell me that. Tell me.

1951
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:38,500
Why are you looking for her?

1952
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:39,250
Ey!

1953
01:41:39,417 --> 01:41:41,000
I don't have time
to explain Meneka.

1954
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,958
-She wants to kill me.
-What!?

1955
01:41:43,083 --> 01:41:44,250
She wants to kill me.

1956
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:45,667
Where's she, tell me.

1957
01:41:46,583 --> 01:41:47,458
Tell me!

1958
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:48,583
Tell me!

1959
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:49,667
I'll tell you.

1960
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,333
Did you expect this? You wouldn't
have expected to come alive.

1961
01:42:05,292 --> 01:42:06,292
Vaishnavi.

1962
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:09,583
Mohini!

1963
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:13,708
Ey!!!

1964
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:17,000
Oh no Vaishnavi,
what are you doing?

1965
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:18,125
Let him go.

1966
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:20,333
Didn't I tell you?

1967
01:42:20,833 --> 01:42:23,875
That it'll be me who'll return.

1968
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:26,875
Vaishnavi, what's all this?

1969
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:28,542
Let him go.

1970
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:30,000
Please let him go.

1971
01:42:30,042 --> 01:42:31,750
I beg of you Vaishnavi.

1972
01:42:31,792 --> 01:42:32,792
Please let him go.

1973
01:42:33,417 --> 01:42:35,417
Didn't I ask you to let
me go the same way?

1974
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:38,250
Did he let me go?

1975
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:40,542
Did he!?

1976
01:44:58,875 --> 01:45:00,000
If you kill me,

1977
01:45:00,375 --> 01:45:03,708
my son, will not let
you go that easy.

1978
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:07,417
Even if it requires the entire
wealth, he'll destroy you.

1979
01:45:07,625 --> 01:45:08,625
Come on!

1980
01:45:09,417 --> 01:45:13,417
The moment you said your son will
be successor to your wealth,

1981
01:45:13,542 --> 01:45:16,208
I decided to kill him too.

1982
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,375
Now you, later it will be him.

1983
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:20,042
Mohini will definitely
kill your son.

1984
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:24,458
Why should my Son die for
no reason of mistake,

1985
01:46:24,542 --> 01:46:26,208
What you're stating is Dharma.

1986
01:46:26,292 --> 01:46:30,667
But Mohini who has come to
avenge is a Spirit and a ghost.

1987
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
We can't expect any kinda
of Dharma from it.

1988
01:46:33,208 --> 01:46:34,792
Please do something about it.

1989
01:46:36,083 --> 01:46:37,500
There are so many religions,

1990
01:46:37,792 --> 01:46:39,500
there are many Gods.

1991
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:43,875
Isn't there even one
God to save my son.

1992
01:46:44,167 --> 01:46:46,583
There's a way to save your son.

1993
01:46:46,667 --> 01:46:47,792
Tell me what is that?

1994
01:46:47,792 --> 01:46:51,833
Mohini is so powerful, because
of Vaishnavi's body.

1995
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:54,708
We have to separate the
spirit from that body

1996
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:56,583
What are trying to say?

1997
01:46:56,583 --> 01:46:57,750
On the 13th,

1998
01:46:58,458 --> 01:47:00,583
there will be a Solar Eclipse,

1999
01:47:00,875 --> 01:47:03,292
exactly when the clock turns 6:52,

2000
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:05,417
the eclipse which
is going to form,

2001
01:47:05,542 --> 01:47:07,542
Avittam Star will
be seen in India.

2002
01:47:08,167 --> 01:47:09,167
At that time,

2003
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:14,333
Namboodri will perform one
of the crucial prayer.

2004
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:15,833
That's when,

2005
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,667
I'm going to separate Mohini's
Spirit from her body.

2006
01:47:18,667 --> 01:47:21,208
So you're saying, Vaishnavi...

2007
01:47:21,208 --> 01:47:23,875
That's right Menaka,
Vaihsnavi should die.

2008
01:47:28,167 --> 01:47:31,750
Only then Mohini won't
get Vaishnavi's body.

2009
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:33,875
To kill your son,

2010
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,917
Mohini needs only that body.

2011
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:39,292
Vaishnavi should die.

2012
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:40,708
Are you kidding?

2013
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:43,583
We didn't come here so that
Vaishnavi can be killed.

2014
01:47:43,625 --> 01:47:45,208
Your idea doesn't amuse us.

2015
01:47:45,333 --> 01:47:47,667
I'll be different person if
we're not inside a Temple.

2016
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:50,125
Let her stay alive, we don't
mind getting beaten up.

2017
01:47:50,208 --> 01:47:52,208
You're giving up on the ones
who have entrusted you.

2018
01:47:52,208 --> 01:47:54,708
Vaihsnavi is not my daughter
in law, she's my daughter.

2019
01:47:55,958 --> 01:47:57,583
I won't agree to this.

2020
01:47:58,042 --> 01:47:59,792
I understand all your problems.

2021
01:48:00,042 --> 01:48:01,667
I have no desire
to kill someone.

2022
01:48:02,875 --> 01:48:05,208
But there's no other
way to go about it.

2023
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:06,417
Hey, Balki.

2024
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:08,833
He seems useless, let's
Take Vaishu to our town.

2025
01:48:09,083 --> 01:48:10,833
You can't do anything now.

2026
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:12,792
Vaishnavi is now Mohini.

2027
01:48:12,958 --> 01:48:14,375
She won't listen to anyone.

2028
01:48:14,583 --> 01:48:16,750
It's the fate that one
life has to be lost.

2029
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:20,875
In order to save your Son,
we have to do some prayers.

2030
01:48:21,542 --> 01:48:23,042
Believe in God,

2031
01:48:23,375 --> 01:48:24,250
Be brave.

2032
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:25,792
everything will fall in place.

2033
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:28,750
But there will be a
sacrifice of one life.

2034
01:48:29,542 --> 01:48:30,833
No one can stop that.

2035
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:38,875
Who's that?

2036
01:48:39,958 --> 01:48:40,792
You're...!?

2037
01:48:40,833 --> 01:48:42,292
I'm Sandeep's mother.

2038
01:48:42,792 --> 01:48:44,958
-Can I come in?
-Please come in.

2039
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:49,333
Did you happen to see a
girl who looks like Mohini?

2040
01:48:50,042 --> 01:48:51,042
Yes...!

2041
01:48:51,417 --> 01:48:55,167
But...that happiness
was short lived.

2042
01:48:56,292 --> 01:48:58,500
I wasn't able to decide whether
it was dream or reality.

2043
01:48:58,625 --> 01:48:59,958
That was reality.

2044
01:49:01,125 --> 01:49:02,375
But that's not Mohini.

2045
01:49:02,875 --> 01:49:03,583
Vaishnavi!

2046
01:49:04,750 --> 01:49:06,750
I've come down to speak
to you about that.

2047
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,458
I didn't believe that
my daughter was dead.

2048
01:49:30,167 --> 01:49:33,042
That's why I haven't put
flowers on the picture.

2049
01:49:34,125 --> 01:49:35,125
I'm so sorry.

2050
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:39,667
Can you help us save Vaishnavi?

2051
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:43,042
I will definitely help you.

2052
01:49:52,042 --> 01:49:53,333
If I think of her now,

2053
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:56,375
we feel really proud.

2054
01:49:58,167 --> 01:50:01,750
We live with one notion and
he has another plans for us.

2055
01:50:03,917 --> 01:50:05,333
There's nothing in our hands.

2056
01:50:08,208 --> 01:50:10,292
-Let it happen if it has to.
-Don't cry.

2057
01:50:10,417 --> 01:50:13,083
Doesn't matter if my Son dies,
Vaishnavi should be alive.

2058
01:50:13,125 --> 01:50:14,500
Don't say such things.

2059
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:17,917
Even if Vaishnavi is alive,

2060
01:50:19,167 --> 01:50:22,375
that ghost will never
let her live in peace.

2061
01:50:22,417 --> 01:50:26,333
It'll kill your son, and will
stay inside my daughters body.

2062
01:50:27,583 --> 01:50:29,917
We both will lose our children.

2063
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:31,250
Moreover,

2064
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,917
God has given Vaishnavi an
opportunity to save a life.

2065
01:50:38,792 --> 01:50:40,000
Have to console ourselves.

2066
01:50:41,625 --> 01:50:42,792
There's no other way.

2067
01:50:42,792 --> 01:50:44,833
Just like the Swami from
Buddha Temple mentioned,

2068
01:50:44,917 --> 01:50:46,833
we'll take part in
Amman Temple Pooja.

2069
01:50:47,208 --> 01:50:48,542
And will pray for her.

2070
01:50:49,958 --> 01:50:51,250
I don't see another way.

2071
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,583
You carry on to the
Temple rituals.

2072
01:50:53,958 --> 01:50:55,792
I have to return to London
as soon as possible.

2073
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:58,292
And will take part in the
Pooja happening there.

2074
01:50:58,542 --> 01:51:00,500
The monk has informed about it.

2075
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:03,458
ECLIPSE DAY!

2076
01:51:06,167 --> 01:51:06,917
Where's Sandeep?

2077
01:51:07,042 --> 01:51:10,125
Only if he comes here, we can
get Mohini to come here.

2078
01:51:10,417 --> 01:51:12,875
I've sent a car to pic
up Sandeep from Airport

2079
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:16,125
It's him calling.

2080
01:51:17,458 --> 01:51:18,208
Tell me Victor.

2081
01:51:20,833 --> 01:51:21,625
What!?

2082
01:51:22,625 --> 01:51:24,458
Sandeep went away
with Vaishnavi?

2083
01:51:24,875 --> 01:51:25,875
Don't panic.

2084
01:51:25,958 --> 01:51:26,500
Sandeep...

2085
01:51:26,542 --> 01:51:28,125
Call Sandeep right away.

2086
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:31,750
Not reachable.

2087
01:51:35,417 --> 01:51:38,208
Where have you brought me,
straight from Airport?

2088
01:51:38,875 --> 01:51:40,875
I have something to
show you, please come.

2089
01:51:42,667 --> 01:51:43,333
After you,

2090
01:51:43,792 --> 01:51:45,083
how's the house Vaishu?

2091
01:51:45,125 --> 01:51:47,625
What's it Sandeep? you're speaking
like an Real Estate Agent.

2092
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:49,208
When did I say, that I
wanted to buy a house?

2093
01:51:49,833 --> 01:51:50,583
You didn't...

2094
01:51:51,125 --> 01:51:52,083
...but I bought one.

2095
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:53,250
Not for you.

2096
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:55,208
But for Us.

2097
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:58,208
It's my sweet dream house.

2098

02:08:03,083 --> 02:08:04,583
-Oh God! do something!
-Be calm.

2275
02:08:04,625 --> 02:08:06,125
Please go and stop it.

2276
02:08:19,375 --> 02:08:20,333
Sandeep!

2277
02:08:49,167 --> 02:08:51,375
She's going to kill him.

2278
02:08:51,958 --> 02:08:53,542
Come on please do
something and stop her.

2279
02:08:53,583 --> 02:08:55,208
At least now stop her, please.

2280
02:08:56,083 --> 02:08:56,625
Mohini!

2281
02:08:56,750 --> 02:08:58,167
No, no, no, don't go closer.

2282
02:08:58,458 --> 02:09:00,000
Please be patient,
please be patient.

2283
02:09:05,167 --> 02:09:05,875
It's time!

2284
02:09:17,083 --> 02:09:18,292
Sandeep come here.

2285
02:09:18,333 --> 02:09:19,333
Come and stand here quick.

2286
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:21,208
Come on!

2287
02:09:21,958 --> 02:09:24,000
Come faster, and stand
inside this grid.

2288
02:09:24,208 --> 02:09:25,625
Go on, go on inside.

2289
02:09:25,708 --> 02:09:26,417
Come on quick

2290
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:28,083
-Mom!
-Come inside.

2291
02:09:28,083 --> 02:09:28,958
Come on!

2292
02:09:30,542 --> 02:09:32,125
Sandeep come into that Grid.

2293
02:09:32,125 --> 02:09:33,250
Stand inside it.

2294
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:34,333
That's it!

2295
02:09:51,625 --> 02:09:53,500
You think you've escaped!?

2296
02:09:53,542 --> 02:09:54,708
Just five more minutes.

2297
02:09:56,083 --> 02:09:58,958
Then neither that Eclipse nor
this Grid will save you.

2298
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,083
I'll kill you, no
one can stop it.

2299
02:11:30,917 --> 02:11:31,500
Vaishu!

2300
02:11:31,708 --> 02:11:32,000
Beep.

2301
02:11:46,542 --> 02:11:47,458
Vaishu!

2302
02:11:49,292 --> 02:11:50,042
Vaishu.

2303
02:11:50,458 --> 02:11:51,917
Come on guys, let us take her

2304
02:11:51,958 --> 02:11:53,542
fast, fast...she needs help.

2305
02:11:53,583 --> 02:11:54,833
Go, go, go...help.

2306
02:11:54,875 --> 02:11:56,083
Check the oxygen level.

2307
02:12:37,833 --> 02:12:39,500
Swami what happened?

2308
02:12:39,542 --> 02:12:41,542
I've been performing the Blood
Ritual for 30 years for Amman.

2309
02:12:41,667 --> 02:12:45,625
When the ritual comes to an end,
Amman's face will be calm and relaxed.

2310
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:48,000
Today the case is not the same, looks
like something bad is going to happen.

2311
02:12:55,375 --> 02:12:57,917
'Blood Ritual is on I believe

2312
02:12:58,125 --> 02:13:02,333
'But the sinned spirit is not
the one you think it is.'

2313
02:13:02,458 --> 02:13:07,250
'It's not the usual
perverse spirit,'

2314
02:13:07,292 --> 02:13:10,958
'Mohini is an extremely
perverse Spirit'

2315
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,458
'If you want to destroy it...'

2316
02:13:13,917 --> 02:13:16,750
'You have to sacrifice a life'

2317
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,083
'Will you be able to give?'

2318
02:13:19,167 --> 02:13:22,250
'Will you be able to
sacrifice a life?'

2319
02:13:33,292 --> 02:13:35,167
Doctor please somehow
save Vaishnavi,

2320
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:37,000
Please Doctor, please!

2321
02:13:37,042 --> 02:13:38,208
-Let me try
-Please Doctor.

2322
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:39,167
Show me the report...

2323
02:13:39,292 --> 02:13:41,375
-...change to 260 Joules!
-Done Ma'am.

2324
02:13:48,833 --> 02:13:50,583
-She's not reacting
-What are you saying?

2325
02:13:51,083 --> 02:13:52,250
I think she's dead.

2326
02:13:52,292 --> 02:13:53,458
What the hell Doctor!?

2327
02:13:54,042 --> 02:13:55,375
What happened to Vaishnavi?

2328
02:13:55,625 --> 02:13:57,000
When the heart
stops functioning.

2329
02:13:57,708 --> 02:14:01,958
Using CPR, we can try and
revive it within 15 minutes.

2330
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:04,125
But that didn't happen
in Vaishnavi's case.

2331
02:14:04,833 --> 02:14:06,292
If I knew this will happen...

2332
02:14:06,583 --> 02:14:08,917
...I wouldn't have
agreed to this idea.

2333
02:14:08,958 --> 02:14:10,583
What idea are you
talking about Mom?

2334
02:14:10,625 --> 02:14:13,125
Sandeep, in order
to save your life,

2335
02:14:13,667 --> 02:14:14,958
Vaishnavi should die.

2336
02:14:15,917 --> 02:14:17,792
Once Mohini leaves her body,

2337
02:14:19,167 --> 02:14:21,542
Swami said can save Mohini.

2338
02:14:22,958 --> 02:14:23,917
That's why...

2339
02:14:24,292 --> 02:14:26,125
...even I for Vaishnavi's death

2340
02:14:26,458 --> 02:14:28,333
agreed to it with her
parents permission to it.

2341
02:14:28,333 --> 02:14:29,458
What nonsense!?

2342
02:14:30,333 --> 02:14:32,458
Mom how can you be so
selfish about this.

2343
02:14:32,667 --> 02:14:34,542
I could've rather died.

2344
02:14:34,917 --> 02:14:36,708
Could've rather died.

2345
02:14:39,167 --> 02:14:40,500
-Balki!
-Uh!

2346
02:14:40,875 --> 02:14:41,875
It's me speaking.

2347
02:14:42,667 --> 02:14:44,292
Our Vaishu is fine right!?

2348
02:14:44,917 --> 02:14:46,000
She's fine right!?

2349
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:46,792
Sister...

2350
02:14:47,625 --> 02:14:50,208
...I think Vaishu will
leave us all behind.

2351
02:14:50,875 --> 02:14:52,583
Doctor has given up.

2352
02:14:53,208 --> 02:14:54,917
She's lying there unconscious.

2353
02:14:55,042 --> 02:14:55,917
Oh no!

2354
02:14:57,750 --> 02:15:00,083
I didn't send my daughter to
London to sacrifice herself.

2355
02:15:01,458 --> 02:15:03,583
All the Gods I pray to
have given up on me.

2356
02:15:17,458 --> 02:15:21,458
Why should I lose Vaishnavi
for a dead daughter?

2357
02:15:21,500 --> 02:15:23,875
Not only Mohini, Vaishnavi
is a daughter to me as well.

2358
02:15:23,917 --> 02:15:26,292
DNA Connections has given
Mohini the full power.

2359
02:15:26,333 --> 02:15:27,917
A life has to be lost,
that's the fate.

2360
02:15:27,958 --> 02:15:29,958
'Will you be able to
sacrifice a life?'

2361
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,667
If that Mohini wants a life,

2362
02:15:32,125 --> 02:15:35,083
let Vaishnavi go,
rather take my life.

2363
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:53,500
Oh no!

2364
02:16:19,833 --> 02:16:20,583
Doctor!

2365
02:16:20,917 --> 02:16:22,208
She's back, do something.

2366
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:24,875
-Vaishnavi.
-Vaishu.

2367
02:16:25,625 --> 02:16:26,500
Vaishu.

2368
02:16:26,542 --> 02:16:27,792
Vaishu you're alright.

2369
02:16:27,833 --> 02:16:28,750
Vaishnavi!

2370
02:16:57,500 --> 02:17:01,625
Kids, tomorrow everyone should finish
their homework just like Neha.

2371
02:17:01,833 --> 02:17:03,750
If not there will be no
chocolate for anyone.

2372
02:17:03,750 --> 02:17:04,750
Ok!

2373
02:17:04,875 --> 02:17:06,542
Stop, Stop, Stop...stop
right here.

2374
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:08,625
Bye Archana!

2375
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,333
Come on kids get down.

2376
02:17:11,667 --> 02:17:12,542
Hi Mummy!

2377
02:17:12,625 --> 02:17:15,000
Neha, come on my dear.

2378
02:17:15,208 --> 02:17:16,958
You're my sweetheart.

2379
02:17:17,083 --> 02:17:18,542
Look at those cheeks.

2380
02:17:18,750 --> 02:17:22,375
Can keep loving you all
the time, Neha dear.

2381
02:17:27,750 --> 02:17:28,417
Neha.

2382
02:17:30,083 --> 02:17:30,958
Hey Neha!

2383
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:34,417
No, Mohini!

2384
02:17:44,792 --> 02:17:49,417
