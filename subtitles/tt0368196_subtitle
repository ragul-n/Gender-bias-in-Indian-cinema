- Wow!
- Excellent!

53
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:03,849
Well done, Prince.

54
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:06,765
Today, the desires of my
life have been fulfilled.

55
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:10,007
The Moghul emperor
is proud of Tansen.

56
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:13,770
Malwa is proud of his
Afghan prince, Baaz Bahadur.

57
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:15,244
Glory to the Prince.

58
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:16,768
The horses are ready for the hunt.

59
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:18,295
You go ahead. I'll
join you in a bit.

60
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,929
Hafiz Khan, you too
come with me today.

61
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:23,927
Spare me, Prince.

62
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:26,529
I have to reach
Sarangpur today itself.

63
00:06:26,615 --> 00:06:27,751
According to me, it
would been great..

64
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:29,254
If you would've accompanied me.

65
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:31,849
- Why?
- The emperor has called you.

66
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,689
Prince, this servant
is at your service.

67
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:38,769
- Who is he?
- Nothing, Lord.

68
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:41,164
He is my sister's
cousin brother's son.

69
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,530
Gosh! I guess he has
forgotten me after sister's death.

70
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:47,845
The emperor has sent
his letter for you.

71
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:52,607
- Father.
- Where is he?

72
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:53,764
In Sujawalpur.

73
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,004
What's the matter, Lord?

74
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:03,528
Father has ordered me to
go to Sahranpur right away..

75
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:05,845
And take charge of the army.

76
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:08,324
So, you see. I had told you.

77
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:11,095
Anyway. You don't need
to be worried at all.

78
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:12,847
You go for the hunt gladly.

79
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:15,245
But the emperor has sent this order.

80
00:07:16,695 --> 00:07:18,174
Why the hell am I there for?

81
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:20,925
I'm the commander-in-chief
of the Sarangpur fort.

82
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:22,768
This is my responsibility.

83
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:24,004
Thank you.

84
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:26,094
I trust you completely.

85
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:30,531
I live in Sajiabad instead of
Sarangpur because of my trust in you.

86
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,164
Okay.

87
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,591
But see to it that my
father doesn't get any chance..

88
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:39,607
Of being angry
at me in my absence.

89
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,606
Don't you worry, Prince.

90
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,014
I'll manage everything.

91
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,166
Okay. See you.

92
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,245
Lord. Look over there. A deer.

93
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:49,927
"The Bulbul sings in the orchard."

94
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:54,008
"The cuckoo sings on the branch."

95
00:09:54,255 --> 00:09:56,007
"Fall in love."

96
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:58,014
"Fall in love."

97
00:09:58,095 --> 00:10:00,768
"The season of love is here."

98
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:04,689
"The buds are
singing this to the bees."

99
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:30,533
"Love is like a knife edge."

100
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:34,528
"Love is difficult."

101
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:39,167
"Love drove Meera crazy."

102
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:43,771
"Chanting her beloved's name."

103
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:56,327
"The people who are in
love don't fear the world."

104
00:10:56,415 --> 00:11:01,011
"Lovers thrive in this fire."

105
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:12,853
"Millions of moths die in the
flame lured in by the flame."

106
00:11:17,535 --> 00:11:21,687
"The deer sacrifices its
life when it hears the flute."

107
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:25,529
"Fall in love."

108
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:27,925
"Fall in love."

109
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:32,167
"The season of love is here."

110
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:35,770
"The buds are
singing this to the bees."

111
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:40,328
"Love drove Meera crazy."

112
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,533
"Chanting her beloved's name."

113
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:56,530
"How is anyone going
to fall in love.."

114
00:11:56,615 --> 00:12:01,166
"Since there is no beloved here."

115
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:13,535
"Love can't win if there
is no love filled melody."

116
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:23,532
"When the strings of the Veena
( musical instrument)..

117
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:26,175
Are played love blossoms."

118
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:27,927
"Fall in love."

119
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:29,528
"Fall in love."

120
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,334
"The season of love is here."

121
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:36,169
"The buds are
singing this to the bees."

122
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:40,248
"Love drove Meera crazy."

123
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:44,328
"Chanting her beloved's name."

124
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,532
Princess! Princess!

125
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:31,248
- Listen.
- You?

126
00:13:31,535 --> 00:13:34,174
Yes. I'm Majid Khan.

127
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,767
People call me Baag Bahadur.

128
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:39,528
Oh. The prince of Malwa.

129
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,014
Don't get scared.

130
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:45,165
I know Dhansu, the
king of Dharampuri.

131
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,685
I guess you're his princess.

132
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:51,528
- Yes.
- What is your name?

133
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,324
Roopmati.

134
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,529
I want to hear your song once again.

135
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:03,167
My song. I don't sing well at all.

136
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:07,529
Today, after
listening to your song..

137
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,845
It seems as if I'm
nothing in comparison to you.

138
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,323
No, Princess.

139
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:13,591
The truth is that I
have heard such a melody..

140
00:14:13,615 --> 00:14:15,526
For the first time ever.

141
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:20,254
I wonder how come I got
the words of your son.

142
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,007
And I automatically started singing.

143
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:26,527
Princess, we're getting late.

144
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:30,531
Okay. I'm getting late. See you.

145
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:37,006
I come here to venerate
Narmada every morning and evening.

146
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:46,767
Friend, tell me.

147
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:51,531
Have you ever heard
such a melodious song?

148
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:53,526
To tell you the truth, these ears..

149
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:56,334
Are habituated to
listening to your singing.

150
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,768
Then how can I like
someone else's song?

151
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:01,004
You flatterer.

152
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:03,095
People should learn how to
flatter people from you.

153
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:05,528
There is no comparison between..

154
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:08,254
My singing and
that heavenly singing.

155
00:15:10,095 --> 00:15:14,771
Melodies from the soul
create a stir in the soul.

156
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,087
"Wake up, its morning."

157
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:44,930
"Wake up, its morning."

158
00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:51,250
"The morning has turned into the
afternoon in this conversation."

159
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:54,930
"Wake up, its morning."

160
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:58,530
"Wake up, its morning."

161
00:16:02,255 --> 00:16:05,850
"Wake up, its morning."

162
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,529
Sing, Prince.

163
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:38,531
"Wake up, its morning."

164
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:41,254
"Wake up, its morning."

165
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:42,764
Sing, son.

166
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:44,004
Sing.

167
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:09,526
Oh, my God! The emperor is here.

168
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:19,247
"The Bulbul sings in the orchard."

169
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:23,169
"The Cuckoo sings on the branch."

170
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:25,246
"Fall in love."

171
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:27,094
"Fall in love."

172
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:30,008
"The season of love is here."

173
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:33,690
"The buds are
singing this to the bees."

174
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:55,164
Majid Khan.

175
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:00,164
Father.

176
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:07,165
Father. You. Please have a seat.

177
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:09,173
I wasn't informed
that you were coming.

178
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:10,815
If I would've informed you..

179
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:13,295
You wouldn't you have got a
chance to conjure up an excuse.

180
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:16,845
I had sent you a letter
ordering you to leave for Sarangpur.

181
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:20,088
But neither have you
replied to that letter.

182
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:22,526
And nor did you go to Sarangpur.

183
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,526
I got to know that
you're having fun..

184
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:28,334
In your royal palace
disregarding my letter.

185
00:18:28,855 --> 00:18:31,244
That's why I had to come here.

186
00:18:31,415 --> 00:18:35,010
But I was ready to go to Sarangpur.

187
00:18:35,855 --> 00:18:39,404
Hafiz Khan had told me that
he'll call me when the need arises.

188
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,254
Can there be any more
pressing issue than this?

189
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:45,527
Do you know Behram Khan
the commander-in-chief..

190
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:48,004
Of the Moghuls is eyeing Malwa.

191
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,690
Akbar is prepared.

192
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:53,927
The Pathans will be doomed
if they launch an attack.

193
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:55,528
We'll find it difficult to flee.

194
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,333
Our enemies will have to flee.

195
00:18:57,695 --> 00:18:59,014
Pathans aren't this coward.

196
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:03,530
If the Moghuls don't
care about their lives.

197
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:06,526
The Pathans aren't sissies either.

198
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:09,246
We know how to give
them a fitting reply.

199
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:11,768
Malwa belongs to the Pathans.

200
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:13,455
And it will always
belong to Pathans.

201
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,764
Well said.

202
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,325
This is the answer I
expected from you.

203
00:19:17,695 --> 00:19:20,334
But this is no
ordinary task, Prince.

204
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:24,086
You'll have to give up
all your luxuries for this.

205
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:25,575
You can't carry out this task..

206
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:27,765
Just by sitting in a
chamber and singing.

207
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,927
You are not a kid anymore.

208
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,008
Try to understand
your responsibilities.

209
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:36,326
Don't forget that you are
the future emperor of Malwa.

210
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:38,246
This is what I have to say.

211
00:19:38,535 --> 00:19:40,526
We'll have to guard
the boundary of Malwa..

212
00:19:40,615 --> 00:19:42,591
On all three sides so that
we don't suffer any harm..

213
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,606
Because of the
attack of the Malwas.

214
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:47,325
Your brother Daulata is in Ujjain.

215
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:48,854
I shall leave for Shujawalpur.

216
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:52,610
And you leave for Sarangpur.
Right now.

217
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:56,333
Darling, Hafiz Khan is not a novice.

218
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,846
I've made a move that
will change the game.

219
00:20:00,255 --> 00:20:03,691
You know I
appeased king Shujad Khan.

220
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:05,766
As soon as Baag Bahadur comes here..

221
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:08,609
I'll get him married
to my daughter, Hamida.

222
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:12,769
Baag Bahadur is the
future emperor of Malwa.

223
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:15,765
Our daughter will be
the queen of Malwa.

224
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,849
Baag Bahadur is extremely
fond of singing and music.

225
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:22,531
And I want him to be engrossed
in this hobby all his life.

226
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,767
Only Hamida can do this.

227
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,690
Because she is expert
at dancing and singing.

228
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,606
- Mother.
- Come, dear. Come.

229
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,335
- They haven't arrived yet.
- Who?

230
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:35,845
Malwa's future king,
Baag Bahadur. Obviously.

231
00:20:36,015 --> 00:20:39,530
So, you saw. She
is thrilled to bits.

232
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,093
I don't understand
what you are saying.

233
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,526
I was saying that
Ustad ( maestro ) Maan Khan..

234
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:46,685
Is coming along with the prince.

235
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:48,926
Now, I'll learn singing from him.

236
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:51,086
Enough of your singing.

237
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:53,007
Now, I've made such a arrangement..

238
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:55,689
That you'll be teaching
Baag Bahadur all your life.

239
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:56,924
What?

240
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:58,926
Yes. I'm right, dear.

241
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:00,414
Ask your mother.

242
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:02,686
So, what were you saying, dear?

243
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:05,529
Baag Bahadur is the
future king of Malwa.

244
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:08,163
And our daughter will
become the queen of Malwa.

245
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:09,604
Mother.

246
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:14,605
Hail prince Majid Khan!

247
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:18,324
Hail prince Baag Bahadur!

248
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,085
Hail prince Baag Bahadur!

249
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:30,847
Stop it. Who is he?

250
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:32,004
Lord, he is..

251
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:34,014
Lord, it's me. I'm a singer.

252
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:35,324
Quiet.

253
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:37,685
Aren't you ashamed of
singing during the army drills?

254
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:39,766
Take him away. And
lock him in the dungeon.

255
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:41,004
Lord, forgive me.

256
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:42,528
What's my fault, Lord?

257
00:21:48,255 --> 00:21:50,086
Commander-in-chief,
this is sheer injustice.

258
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:55,003
This is the future emperor of Malwa.

259
00:21:55,095 --> 00:21:57,609
If this carries on, we'll
have to leave Malwa, Lord.

260
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:59,253
Yes, we'll have to leave Malwa.

261
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:00,991
- Yes, we'll have to leave Malwa.
- Quiet. Trust me.

262
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:04,610
I'll not let you be
harmed in any which way.

263
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:22,927
Gosh! He is a human or a monster.

264
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:25,924
Seems like he is a made of steel.

265
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:29,095
I had thought that he
is a singer. An artist.

266
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,690
He must be a pushover. But..

267
00:22:32,255 --> 00:22:34,007
But what happened?

268
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:36,530
Dear, ask me what did not happen.

269
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:39,688
Today, the prince
exhausted me to death.

270
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:44,008
We were riding horses all day long.

271
00:22:44,335 --> 00:22:46,849
And now, he wants to go hunting.

272
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:48,084
Great.

273
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:51,243
Now. At night.

274
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:54,088
Now, you go explain to him.

275
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:55,608
I can't dare to talk to him.

276
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:58,926
- I..
- How the hell do I go before him?

277
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:01,404
Dear Hamida, now you do something.

278
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:02,764
Save the day for me.

279
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,848
Perhaps he might get
absorbed in your singing..

280
00:23:05,935 --> 00:23:08,244
And I'm spared of going on
the hunt with him at night.

281
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:09,609
And I'm spared.

282
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:19,531
Who is singing away at
this inappropriate hour?

283
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:28,926
This is maestro Maan Khan's voice.

284
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,608
Khan sir! Khan sir!

285
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:53,005
- Khan sir!
- Darn it!

286
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,926
I'm stuck in such a lousy place.

287
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:58,246
They don't let me
practice even at night.

288
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:01,605
Oh, my God! What wretched life.

289
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:03,767
I'm stuck in such a awful place.

290
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:06,928
Maan Khan is whiling away
time killing mosquitoes.

291
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:10,527
There is no singing or dancing.

292
00:24:32,615 --> 00:24:34,094
Whose voice is this?

293
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:35,404
Whoever it might be.

294
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:39,006
God Almighty has
answered my prayers.

295
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:43,327
And he has sent a fairy from
heaven taking pity on you.

296
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:23,003
"It's such a beautiful night."

297
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,689
"And beauty is at its zenith."

298
00:25:25,935 --> 00:25:28,529
"My heart is crazy."

299
00:25:28,775 --> 00:25:30,606
"Only for you."

300
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:33,928
"Come, let's fall in love."

301
00:25:34,255 --> 00:25:36,530
"Settle down with me."

302
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:39,528
"My heart is crazy."

303
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:41,766
"Only for you."

304
00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:44,526
"Only for you."

305
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:47,768
"It's such a beautiful night."

306
00:26:00,535 --> 00:26:05,848
"Oh, unfaithful one, don't be late."

307
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:13,610
"Oh, unfaithful one, don't be late."

308
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:18,931
"Don't rekindle the
pain that's hidden."

309
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:23,927
"Don't rekindle the
pain that's hidden."

310
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:30,533
"The beautiful
seasons call out to you.'

311
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:35,609
"The beautiful
seasons call out to you.'

312
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:38,528
"My heart is crazy."

313
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:40,846
"Only for you."

314
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:43,014
"Only for you."

315
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,527
"It's such a beautiful night."

316
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,174
"The air is heady."

317
00:27:02,255 --> 00:27:04,849
"The climate is inviting."

318
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:10,333
"The air is heady."

319
00:27:10,415 --> 00:27:12,531
"The climate is inviting."

320
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:17,929
"The cold breeze has
started biting me."

321
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:22,926
"The cold breeze has
started biting me."

322
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:29,533
"Come silently. And
sneak into my heart."

323
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:34,609
"Come silently. And
sneak into my heart."

324
00:27:34,935 --> 00:27:37,529
"My heart is going crazy."

325
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,606
"Only for you."

326
00:27:40,255 --> 00:27:42,530
"Only for you."

327
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:45,529
"It's such a beautiful night."

328
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:48,255
"And beauty is at its zenith."

329
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:50,924
"My heart is crazy."

330
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,530
"Only for you."

331
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:55,766
"Only for you."

332
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:59,527
"It's such a beautiful night."

333
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:06,007
Great. Who are you?

334
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:08,604
What is your name?

335
00:28:08,695 --> 00:28:09,764
Why are you feeling shy?

336
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:13,526
This is the future emperor of Malwa.

337
00:28:13,855 --> 00:28:15,607
This is my daughter, Hamida.

338
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:17,415
She is extremely fond of singing.

339
00:28:18,535 --> 00:28:19,604
She sings well.

340
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:24,166
Okay. Keep the horses
ready for the hunt tomorrow.

341
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:25,924
Hunt?

342
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:28,084
I can't help it.

343
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:30,527
There is no other pastime here.

344
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:32,014
There sure is, Lord.

345
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:33,688
Singing. Dancing. Instruments.

346
00:28:33,775 --> 00:28:35,925
You'll get anything you wish for.

347
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:39,008
No. Keep the horses in the morning.

348
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:43,165
- See you.
- See you.

349
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:59,327
Roopmati, I've come to take you.

350
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:02,006
- Where?
- Mandav.

351
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:06,685
I've decided that I'll
take you to Mandav..

352
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:09,765
And built a temple
of music for you there.

353
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:13,609
And you'll rehearse singing there.

354
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:18,775
And because of that my craving
for music will also be satisfied.

355
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:24,325
But I can't leave my
motherland and mother Narmada.

356
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:26,004
Don't say that, Roop.

357
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:28,244
I saw a dream last night.

358
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:29,688
And I will fulfil it at any cost.

359
00:30:30,335 --> 00:30:32,929
Dream. What dream?

360
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:35,325
I saw that the subjects of Malwa..

361
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,848
Have gathered in large numbers..

362
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:39,084
And are singing together.

363
00:30:40,535 --> 00:30:41,854
Long live Malwa's Meera.

364
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:44,334
Long live Malwa's Meera.

365
00:30:44,415 --> 00:30:46,929
Malwa's Meera. No. No.

366
00:30:47,775 --> 00:30:49,527
Revered Meera is a Goddess.

367
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:51,927
She is an incarnation
of Goddess Saraswati.

368
00:30:52,615 --> 00:30:54,845
I don't even measure
up to her toenail.

369
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:57,085
Roop, you still
haven't known yourself.

370
00:30:58,175 --> 00:31:01,167
You aren't born to bloom in
the jungle and then to wilt away.

371
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:04,094
Come with me to Mandav.

372
00:31:05,335 --> 00:31:07,530
Live there and then you
shall see, how your singing..

373
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,845
Gets fame all over Malwa.

374
00:31:11,175 --> 00:31:12,688
I'll convince your father.

375
00:31:13,535 --> 00:31:15,014
You just give your approval.

376
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:17,925
If it was only about my approval..

377
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:20,254
I would've surely said yes.

378
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:23,527
But this is
entirely different matter.

379
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:25,604
What is it?

380
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:29,405
If you really want to know,
then here you go.

381
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,607
Many years ago.

382
00:31:33,535 --> 00:31:35,253
I wasn't even born then.

383
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:40,687
Mother Narmada flooded Dharampuri,
our motherland.

384
00:31:41,615 --> 00:31:45,244
Houses, palaces, and fields
everything was under water.

385
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:47,687
There was turmoil
among the subjects.

386
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:52,246
Mother Narmada, we
are at your mercy.

387
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:54,526
Please stop this destruction.

388
00:31:54,615 --> 00:31:56,055
Please stop this destruction,
Mother.

389
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:59,004
I pledge before you..

390
00:31:59,535 --> 00:32:04,689
That I'll surrender
my first child to you.

391
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:06,527
I will hand the baby
over to you, Mother.

392
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:18,528
Hail Mother Narmada!

393
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:20,526
Hail Mother Narmada!

394
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:22,606
Hail Mother Narmada!

395
00:32:45,535 --> 00:32:47,253
King, I'm pleased by you.

396
00:32:47,935 --> 00:32:50,529
Here. This girl is my boon.

397
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:54,008
If she has food only after
paying me a visit every day.

398
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:56,325
Your subjects will always be happy.

399
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:58,323
This is my blessing.

400
00:33:05,335 --> 00:33:09,169
As a result I'm
mother Narmada's blessing.

401
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,591
I was born only so
that the hardships..

402
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,455
Of the subjects of
Neema are done away with.

403
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:18,005
My duty is to live on
the banks of Narmada..

404
00:33:18,935 --> 00:33:21,688
And spend my life in
worshipping and revering her.

405
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:23,687
Then how will my dream come true?

406
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,175
How will I be able to
listen to your song?

407
00:33:27,535 --> 00:33:32,609
I'm also as keen to hear
your melodious voice as you are.

408
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:38,769
Okay. Can't you come here every day?

409
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:45,328
Can't we practice our singing
on the banks of the Narmada?

410
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:48,003
Why not? We can for sure.

411
00:33:48,535 --> 00:33:50,253
If you want, I'll
come here every day.

412
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:52,529
Roop, you don't know.

413
00:33:52,935 --> 00:33:54,527
I'm so hungry for music.

414
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:56,854
I can happily give up kingdoms..

415
00:33:57,255 --> 00:34:00,850
Empires and all the
luxuries of the world for music.

416
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:04,531
I wish I could break
all the restrictions..

417
00:34:04,615 --> 00:34:06,685
To hear to your songs.

418
00:34:06,775 --> 00:34:08,333
Princess.

419
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:10,688
You saw it?

420
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:11,844
Yes, Your Highness.

421
00:34:11,935 --> 00:34:14,244
All right. You may leave now.

422
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:17,764
This is the question of my pride.

423
00:34:20,335 --> 00:34:21,529
As soon as I benefited..

424
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:24,765
I had surrender Roopmati
at the feet of mother Narmada.

425
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:26,590
Roopmati is the
protector of the peace..

426
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:28,294
And well-being of
the subjects of Malwa.

427
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,172
If she takes one wrong step..

428
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:34,163
Our entire kingdom will go barren.

429
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:36,604
We'll have to leave our motherland.

430
00:34:37,014 --> 00:34:40,529
Your Highness, listen to our pleas.

431
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:43,231
Who is going to listen to
our grievances if not you?

432
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:45,007
Your Highness, listen to our pleas.

433
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:46,231
Your Highness, listen to our pleas.

434
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:47,775
- Protect us.
- Play heed to our pleas.

435
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:49,334
Protect us, Lord.

436
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:50,853
Give us a life.

437
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:54,244
Calm down. Calm down.

438
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:57,688
I'm very well aware of your pain.

439
00:34:57,935 --> 00:35:00,403
But there is no fault
of Roopmati in this.

440
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:01,911
If this is not princess's fault..

441
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,415
Then whose sins are we paying for?

442
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,165
Sin. What sin?

443
00:35:06,535 --> 00:35:08,526
Lord, don't make us open our mouths.

444
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:12,529
We would be better off
leaving our motherland.

445
00:35:13,535 --> 00:35:14,604
Oh.

446
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,526
The subjects demand justice, Lord.

447
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,254
The princess must be
punished for her sins.

448
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:20,848
Roopmati will have to atone for it.

449
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:22,655
Roopmati can't live
in Dharampuri anymore.

450
00:35:22,695 --> 00:35:24,094
We demand sacrifice, Lord.

451
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:25,311
We demand she atones for her sins.

452
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:27,007
We demand she atones for her sins.

453
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:30,008
Not a problem. Don't worry.

454
00:35:30,935 --> 00:35:33,324
If this indeed is the
outcome of someone's sin..

455
00:35:33,535 --> 00:35:36,415
Then he'll have to atone for his
sins even at the expense of his life.

456
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:38,766
Even if it's the princess.

457
00:35:57,535 --> 00:36:01,005
"The string of the
lute of life says."

458
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:04,925
"Every breath I take says.."

459
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:08,925
"Love speaks in
every beat of the heart."

460
00:36:09,015 --> 00:36:10,528
"What it says."

461
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,404
"What it says."

462
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:14,526
"What it says."

463
00:36:14,615 --> 00:36:16,173
"I wonder what it says."

464
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:17,324
"I wonder what it says."

465
00:36:17,415 --> 00:36:18,689
"I wonder what it says."

466
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:38,524
"Someone has satiated my
ears with this melody."

467
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:50,694
"Someone's melodies have
made my heart go crazy."

468
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:53,688
"Has made my heart go crazy."

469
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:57,925
"The joy in my heart says."

470
00:36:58,535 --> 00:37:01,845
"The sweet call of the Cuckoo says."

471
00:37:02,535 --> 00:37:05,845
"The clanking sound
of the anklets says."

472
00:37:05,935 --> 00:37:07,527
"I wonder what it says."

473
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:09,324
"What does it say?"

474
00:37:09,415 --> 00:37:11,406
"What does it say?
What does it say?"

475
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:13,173
"I wonder what it says."

476
00:37:13,255 --> 00:37:14,324
"I wonder what it says."

477
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:15,689
"I wonder what it says."

478
00:37:27,935 --> 00:37:31,848
"The waves of the ocean
produce melodious tune."

479
00:37:31,935 --> 00:37:35,530
"The clouds have turned red."

480
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:43,609
The sky has sung such a song today.

481
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:47,404
"That even mother earth is
joining in the orchestration."

482
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:50,607
"Mother earth too is
joining in the orchestration."

483
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,925
"The rays of the moon say."

484
00:37:55,255 --> 00:37:58,770
"The current of free
flowing streams says."

485
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:02,531
"My strings of hearts say."

486
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,173
"I wonder what they say."

487
00:38:04,935 --> 00:38:06,004
"What does it say?"

488
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:08,006
"What does it say?
What does it say?"

489
00:38:08,095 --> 00:38:09,608
"I wonder what it says."

490
00:38:09,695 --> 00:38:10,764
"I wonder what it says."

491
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,334
"I wonder what it says."

492
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:16,165
"The string of the
lute of life says."

493
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:20,005
"Every breath I take says."

494
00:38:20,535 --> 00:38:23,766
"Love speaks in
every heat of the heart."

495
00:38:23,855 --> 00:38:25,413
"What does it say?"

496
00:38:26,175 --> 00:38:27,244
"What does it say?"

497
00:38:27,335 --> 00:38:29,326
"What does it say?"

498
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:30,934
"I wonder what it says."

499
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:32,084
"I wonder what it says."

500
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:33,688
"I wonder what it says."

501
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:40,530
You know I was so
humiliated before..

502
00:38:40,615 --> 00:38:42,253
The subjects today because of you.

503
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:44,607
- Because of me.
- Yes.

504
00:38:45,175 --> 00:38:46,591
I know whom do you go to
meet under the pretext..

505
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,004
Of venerating and
revering mother Narmada.

506
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:52,689
I go to offer my prayers
to mother Narmada every day.

507
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:56,004
And prince Baaz
Bahadur also comes there.

508
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:58,926
So, how does that
cause you humiliation?

509
00:39:00,775 --> 00:39:03,084
Baaz Bahadur is a great musician.

510
00:39:04,535 --> 00:39:09,325
What's wrong in it if I get
to serve music by his grace?

511
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:11,014
There is nothing wrong, dear.

512
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:13,246
But I do shut people up.

513
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:16,687
They're of the view that you
meeting the prince is a sin.

514
00:39:17,015 --> 00:39:20,325
And it's the outcome of that sin
that our lands are going barren.

515
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:21,975
There is drought in many places.

516
00:39:22,015 --> 00:39:23,243
People are starving to death.

517
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:27,610
Sin. Is meeting the prince a sin?

518
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:28,764
Yes, dear.

519
00:39:28,855 --> 00:39:31,528
Your birth was for the
welfare of the subjects.

520
00:39:31,855 --> 00:39:33,686
You're the boon
granted by mother Narmada.

521
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:35,591
Our kingdom of Neemar flourishes..

522
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:38,254
Because of your veneration
and reverence of mother Narmada.

523
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:40,926
And today this, place is
suffering from draught.

524
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:44,095
And people are saying this
is the outcome of your sin.

525
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:45,604
Now, you tell me.

526
00:39:46,095 --> 00:39:48,404
What answer do I give them? And how?

527
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:50,324
Come with me.

528
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:53,174
See the miserable state your
dear Neemar is in for yourself.

529
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:54,404
Come.

530
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:00,844
Look at this.

531
00:40:01,255 --> 00:40:03,405
Our land is getting drier.

532
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:05,334
We are hit by draught.

533
00:40:06,255 --> 00:40:07,768
People are dying of starvation.

534
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:10,928
There is no food to
eat or water to drink.

535
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:14,255
The sin of their
untimely death is on you.

536
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:16,845
You'll have to atone for this sin.

537
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:19,093
You'll have to give them a life.

538
00:40:19,695 --> 00:40:21,526
I want to get you married off..

539
00:40:21,615 --> 00:40:23,526
Before people cast aspersions..

540
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:25,253
On the chastity of a single girl.

541
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:27,535
You'll have to get married to keep..

542
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:29,924
The honour of women race intact.

543
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:33,611
You'll have to marry
to atone for your sins.

544
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:36,767
Yes, Father. I'll get married.

545
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,688
I'll get married for the
peace and welfare of my subjects.

546
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:11,684
The wedding party is here.

547
00:41:11,775 --> 00:41:12,844
The wedding party is here.

548
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:14,404
Where is the groom?

549
00:41:14,535 --> 00:41:16,332
There he is. Look. Over there.

550
00:41:16,415 --> 00:41:18,690
Him. That fatso.
With huge moustaches.

551
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:21,071
I wonder if those are eyes
that he has or something else.

552
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,609
Move. Let me also see.

553
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:31,083
Oh. The groom is so gorgeous.

554
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,849
Great. So you're
going weak in the knees.

555
00:41:33,935 --> 00:41:35,004
Go away.

556
00:41:56,855 --> 00:42:01,326
"When the bride arrives
adorning her eyes with kohl.."

557
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:06,008
"When the bride arrives
adorning her eyes with kohl.."

558
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:22,528
Friend, will you do me a favour?

559
00:42:22,935 --> 00:42:24,414
Sure. Tell me.

560
00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:32,404
Friend, I want to go
there once before my wedding.

561
00:42:32,535 --> 00:42:35,686
- Where?
- To the banks of Narmada.

562
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:39,688
Where I had heard that
eternal melody for the first time.

563
00:42:40,535 --> 00:42:41,854
I can't control my heart.

564
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:44,246
That music is pulling me towards it.

565
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:46,004
Take me there.

566
00:42:46,095 --> 00:42:47,244
Take me there, Friend.

567
00:42:47,335 --> 00:42:48,404
But we don't have time.

568
00:42:48,615 --> 00:42:50,311
We have to go for the
veneration of the ancestral Goddess.

569
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:51,768
That can wait.

570
00:42:53,935 --> 00:42:56,085
First, let me satiate my heart.

571
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:59,246
Who knows when I'll
return after marriage?

572
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,604
Listen to me, friend.

573
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:01,764
I beg of you.

574
00:43:01,855 --> 00:43:02,924
What are you doing?

575
00:43:03,535 --> 00:43:06,174
- Wait. Let me go check first.
- Go.

576
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:10,613
"When the bride arrives
adorning her eyes with kohl.."

577
00:43:10,775 --> 00:43:15,166
"The groom's heart
will jump for joy."

578
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:29,015
"Come back. Come back."

579
00:43:31,535 --> 00:43:35,528
"Come back."

580
00:43:37,255 --> 00:43:42,534
"Come back, my beloved."

581
00:43:44,935 --> 00:43:49,008
"Come back, my beloved."

582
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:53,532
"My songs call you."

583
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:58,688
"Come back, my beloved."

584
00:43:58,775 --> 00:44:03,166
"My songs call you."

585
00:44:04,335 --> 00:44:09,090
"My music lies lifeless."

586
00:44:09,255 --> 00:44:13,089
"My music lies lifeless."

587
00:44:13,175 --> 00:44:17,771
"My songs call you."

588
00:44:18,935 --> 00:44:23,929
"Come back, my beloved."

589
00:45:01,255 --> 00:45:03,610
"The clouds pour down."

590
00:45:03,695 --> 00:45:05,526
"And so do my eyes."

591
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:07,845
"Look, my heart's longing for you."

592
00:45:07,935 --> 00:45:10,529
"Please come."

593
00:45:11,015 --> 00:45:13,245
"The clouds pour down."

594
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,246
"And so do my eyes."

595
00:45:15,335 --> 00:45:17,530
"Look, my heart's longing for you."

596
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:19,924
"Please come."

597
00:45:20,695 --> 00:45:24,688
"This cool breeze
kindles a fire within me."

598
00:45:24,775 --> 00:45:29,326
"Oh, beloved, please show up."

599
00:45:29,695 --> 00:45:34,610
"This is no way of fulfilling love."

600
00:45:37,095 --> 00:45:40,929
"This is no way of fulfilling love."

601
00:45:41,015 --> 00:45:45,327
"My songs call you."

602
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:51,529
"Come back, my beloved."

603
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:18,090
"You laugh sometimes.
And at times you cry."

604
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:22,168
"Such is life."

605
00:46:22,855 --> 00:46:27,610
"You laugh one moment.
And at times the other."

606
00:46:27,775 --> 00:46:31,529
"Such is life."

607
00:46:32,255 --> 00:46:37,010
"You meet one moment.
And separate the other."

608
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:40,770
"This world is a fair which
lasts for just a couple of days."

609
00:46:41,255 --> 00:46:45,931
"This moment might pass by."

610
00:46:48,335 --> 00:46:52,328
"This moment might pass by."

611
00:46:52,535 --> 00:46:56,767
"My songs call you."

612
00:46:57,935 --> 00:47:01,689
"Come back, my beloved."

613
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:06,167
"My songs call you."

614
00:47:07,335 --> 00:47:11,931
"My music lies lifeless."

615
00:47:12,015 --> 00:47:16,167
"My music lies lifeless."

616
00:47:16,255 --> 00:47:20,407
"My songs call you."

617
00:47:21,535 --> 00:47:26,529
"Come back, my beloved."

618
00:47:53,335 --> 00:47:55,166
Take a good look.

619
00:47:55,535 --> 00:47:58,845
Look. Isn't that your
spinster daughter Rani Roopmati..

620
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:01,325
Who you wanted me to marry.

621
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,327
Look how she's making
the Moon dynasty proud.

622
00:48:07,535 --> 00:48:08,604
Roopmati.

623
00:48:09,015 --> 00:48:10,084
Roopmati.

624
00:48:13,535 --> 00:48:15,855
Why did you come here at this
late hour of the night, dear?

625
00:48:17,855 --> 00:48:19,846
I'm asking you why you came here.

626
00:48:22,095 --> 00:48:23,323
What's wrong?

627
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,655
What are you all doing
here at this late hour?

628
00:48:28,535 --> 00:48:32,323
Prince, you're the
protector of the subjects of Malwa.

629
00:48:32,695 --> 00:48:34,526
You're the future emperor of Malwa.

630
00:48:34,935 --> 00:48:36,527
I want to know what you got..

631
00:48:36,615 --> 00:48:39,766
- By slandering me this way?
- I didn't understand.

632
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,004
How can you understand?

633
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:43,924
You're the king and
we're your subjects.

634
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,327
Our respect and
honour is a toy for you.

635
00:48:47,415 --> 00:48:48,530
Mind your language, Thakur.

636
00:48:48,615 --> 00:48:51,254
No, Prince, he's
my would-be husband.

637
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:54,007
We're supposed to wed today.

638
00:48:56,175 --> 00:49:00,691
Marriage. Marry a girl that
covertly meets another man.

639
00:49:05,095 --> 00:49:06,847
You're mistaken, young man.

640
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,526
Roopmati is chaste like the Narmada.

641
00:49:11,775 --> 00:49:15,245
I want you two to live in
Mandav after the marriage.

642
00:49:17,095 --> 00:49:19,391
Roopmati will help me in my
devotion towards the art of music.

643
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:20,768
I don't want to hear anything.

644
00:49:21,015 --> 00:49:25,008
I will never forget the
humiliation you've caused me.

645
00:49:27,015 --> 00:49:28,164
What are you doing, son?

646
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:29,404
Calm down.

647
00:49:29,535 --> 00:49:30,763
Try to understand.

648
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,333
Hari, Govind. You
two take Roopmati home.

649
00:49:34,535 --> 00:49:35,604
I'll be right back.

650
00:49:37,855 --> 00:49:38,924
Let's go, Sister.

651
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,527
Please return to Mandav,
Your Highness.

652
00:49:53,695 --> 00:49:55,253
I'll explain Baldev Singh.

653
00:49:55,935 --> 00:49:57,527
It's my mistake, Thakur sir.

654
00:49:58,615 --> 00:50:01,083
I never imagined that they'll
magnify such a trivial matter.

655
00:50:03,255 --> 00:50:07,328
Anyway.. please
inform me if you need me.

656
00:50:08,695 --> 00:50:10,253
I'll always be willing to help you.

657
00:50:12,855 --> 00:50:14,527
I'm leaving as well, Thakur.

658
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:19,007
But I'll see to it that who
marries your dear daughter.

659
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:21,245
No, son, don't leave like this.

660
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:22,775
It's the question of my honour.

661
00:50:23,015 --> 00:50:27,327
Just like you value your honour,
Thakur, so do I.

662
00:50:27,615 --> 00:50:30,527
If you had a daughter,
you would've understood..

663
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:33,404
The plight I'm
facing at the moment.

664
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:36,254
If I had such a daughter
I would've poisoned her.

665
00:50:36,855 --> 00:50:38,846
Anyway, I don't want to argue.

666
00:50:39,175 --> 00:50:40,847
If you value your daughter more..

667
00:50:40,935 --> 00:50:42,527
Then keep her with
you all your life.

668
00:50:42,615 --> 00:50:43,684
I'm leaving.

669
00:50:43,775 --> 00:50:46,164
Don't walk away from
this marriage, son.

670
00:50:47,095 --> 00:50:48,528
Think about me.

671
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:50,254
My honour will be tarnished.

672
00:50:50,855 --> 00:50:52,607
I plead you.

673
00:50:54,855 --> 00:50:56,607
Save my honour.

674
00:50:56,855 --> 00:51:00,530
A father like you
should die of shame.

675
00:51:15,695 --> 00:51:18,607
I raised you myself..

676
00:51:19,255 --> 00:51:21,405
And now I'm
giving you this poison.

677
00:51:21,855 --> 00:51:24,927
I want this poison to clear
the blemish on our dynasty.

678
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:27,086
Think about it once more, Dear.

679
00:51:27,855 --> 00:51:30,608
Roopmati is Goddess Narmada's boon.

680
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:33,244
We'll surely go to
hell for killing her.

681
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:36,323
That hell will be
certainly better than this one.

682
00:51:36,855 --> 00:51:39,244
Don't forget that we
belong to the Moon dynasty.

683
00:51:39,535 --> 00:51:41,844
Our ancestors laid
down their lives..

684
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,846
But saved their
dynasty from any blemish!

685
00:51:45,615 --> 00:51:47,253
Don't worry, Father.

686
00:51:48,535 --> 00:51:51,174
If the blemish on our dynasty
can be cleansed only with my life..

687
00:51:52,335 --> 00:51:55,532
- Then I won't hesitate to do so.
- Dear. My dear.

688
00:51:56,255 --> 00:51:57,695
My daughter is chaste, your majesty.

689
00:51:57,775 --> 00:51:59,003
My daughter is chaste.

690
00:51:59,095 --> 00:52:03,327
I know. Roopmati is chaste.
She's pure.

691
00:52:03,535 --> 00:52:07,164
But I can't face
this world like this.

692
00:52:07,335 --> 00:52:09,769
We'll have to make a
sacrifice to clear the blemish.

693
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:11,084
Roopmati.

694
00:52:11,535 --> 00:52:13,765
Your honour will
remain intact, Father.

695
00:52:14,695 --> 00:52:17,004
The moon dynasty will
retain their reputation.

696
00:52:19,415 --> 00:52:20,848
I will swallow this poison..

697
00:52:22,335 --> 00:52:24,769
Considering it
Goddess Narmada's offering.

698
00:52:26,535 --> 00:52:27,763
I certainly will.

699
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,527
Goddess Narmada, my
devotion towards music..

700
00:52:46,615 --> 00:52:48,924
Is left
incomplete in this lifetime.

701
00:52:51,015 --> 00:52:53,529
We both couldn't fulfil our desire.

702
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,167
I've been left all alone in
my devotion towards music.

703
00:52:59,855 --> 00:53:01,334
Shower your grace, Goddess..

704
00:53:02,255 --> 00:53:05,327
So that the entire world
hears Baaz Bahadur's music.

705
00:53:07,255 --> 00:53:09,530
After I die my soul is content..

706
00:53:09,615 --> 00:53:12,527
By hearing his music in heaven.

707
00:53:12,935 --> 00:53:15,688
Dear, committing suicide is a sin.

708
00:53:16,335 --> 00:53:17,575
Don't forget that you're born..

709
00:53:17,615 --> 00:53:20,083
To spread
happiness and peace in Malwa.

710
00:53:20,695 --> 00:53:23,767
You've gained Baaz
Bahadur's respect with your music.

711
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,604
Go there.

712
00:53:25,695 --> 00:53:28,767
You can solve the problems of
Malwa and its subjects from there.

713
00:53:29,015 --> 00:53:32,610
But Goddess, what
will the people say?

714
00:53:34,015 --> 00:53:35,334
What will father say?

715
00:53:35,855 --> 00:53:37,254
No one will say anything.

716
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:40,529
Baaz Bahadur is the
future ruler of Malwa.

717
00:53:41,415 --> 00:53:42,928
He knows his duty.

718
00:53:43,855 --> 00:53:45,695
You're the daughter of
a 'Kshatriya' ( caste ).

719
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,527
You know your duty as well.

720
00:53:48,015 --> 00:53:51,007
Go, go there and make
the art of music eternal..

721
00:53:51,255 --> 00:53:52,529
And lend a helping hand in..

722
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:54,685
Turning that barren
region productive again.

723
00:53:55,015 --> 00:53:57,006
Go. It's my order.

724
00:53:57,095 --> 00:54:00,167
- Go there. Go right now.
- Goddess.

725
00:54:24,615 --> 00:54:27,766
- Princess.
- You.

726
00:54:28,535 --> 00:54:31,925
- Friend, can you get me a fast horse.
- At this hour?

727
00:54:32,015 --> 00:54:33,084
But where will you go?

728
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:35,686
With Goddess Narmada's order..

729
00:54:36,095 --> 00:54:37,528
I'm going to Mandavgarh.

730
00:54:37,935 --> 00:54:40,403
- Hurry up, friend.
- But I won't let you go alone.

731
00:54:40,535 --> 00:54:42,015
- I will come along as well.
- No, no.

732
00:54:42,855 --> 00:54:44,846
If someone spots then
we both will be killed.

733
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:47,685
Why are you
risking your life for me?

734
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:49,529
What more would I want..

735
00:54:49,615 --> 00:54:52,687
- Then laying down my life in your service.
- Heera.

736
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:54,848
Come, come with me.

737
00:55:07,855 --> 00:55:10,847
- I beg your pardon, Your Highness.
- What is it?

738
00:55:11,015 --> 00:55:13,085
There's a man here from Sarangpur.

739
00:55:13,535 --> 00:55:16,845
- The Sultan's condition is delicate.
- Father.

740
00:55:17,255 --> 00:55:18,529
He's keen to see you.

741
00:55:19,335 --> 00:55:20,688
Ready the horses quickly.

742
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:22,255
I'll leave for Sarangpur right now.

743
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,530
Roopmati. What's wrong with her?

744
00:56:14,695 --> 00:56:16,413
She was coming to
Mandavgarh to meet you.

745
00:56:16,615 --> 00:56:18,735
But she collided with a
tree on the way and fell down.

746
00:56:19,015 --> 00:56:22,769
Prince. With Goddess
Narmada's permission..

747
00:56:23,335 --> 00:56:24,927
I've come to stay in Mandav.

748
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:29,691
Mandav? But your father?
Your would-be husband?

749
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:32,768
I've left everyone.

750
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,528
That was the Goddess's order.

751
00:56:38,935 --> 00:56:40,004
That's okay.

752
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:44,324
Tanchin. Take her
to the Jahaj Palace.

753
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:45,671
And you all go with her as well.

754
00:56:45,695 --> 00:56:46,935
I'll travel to Sarangpur alone.

755
00:56:49,535 --> 00:56:51,014
My father is ill in Sarangpur.

756
00:56:51,535 --> 00:56:53,055
It's very important
for me to go there.

757
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,535
But you won't face any
inconvenience in Mandavgarh.

758
00:56:56,535 --> 00:56:58,765
Look after her well.

759
00:56:58,855 --> 00:56:59,924
I'll return soon.

760
00:57:01,015 --> 00:57:03,085
Okay, goodbye.

761
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:15,526
Baaz hasn't arrived yet.

762
00:57:15,695 --> 00:57:17,253
He must be on his way, Your Majesty.

763
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:20,413
He left from Mandav as
soon as he received the news.

764
00:57:23,175 --> 00:57:26,008
Daulat Khan hasn't
arrived from Ujjain as well.

765
00:57:26,535 --> 00:57:27,604
Father.

766
00:57:30,255 --> 00:57:34,089
- Father.
- Who? Baaz.

767
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:41,250
You've arrived. What
was the hurry, son?

768
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:45,528
You should've waited..

769
00:57:45,615 --> 00:57:48,004
- For the news of my demise in Mandavgarh.
- Father.

770
00:57:48,695 --> 00:57:52,529
Look, Akbar's
commander-in-chief Behram Khan..

771
00:57:52,615 --> 00:57:54,765
Has sent this letter.

772
00:57:56,535 --> 00:58:00,528
He says either accept our reign..

773
00:58:01,255 --> 00:58:05,533
Or face the Moghul
army in the battlefield.

774
00:58:05,935 --> 00:58:07,334
How dare that Behram Khan?

775
00:58:07,695 --> 00:58:11,529
The Moghuls dared to
commit this insolence..

776
00:58:11,615 --> 00:58:13,685
Considering me old and weak.

777
00:58:15,855 --> 00:58:19,165
I wish I could give a
fitting reply to this letter, son.

778
00:58:19,255 --> 00:58:21,530
Behram Khan has dared
to wake a sleeping lion.

779
00:58:21,775 --> 00:58:24,608
You don't worry, Father, I'll send
a reply to this letter right away.

780
00:58:27,015 --> 00:58:30,849
All rise. All rise.

781
00:58:31,535 --> 00:58:34,003
All rise.

782
00:58:34,535 --> 00:58:37,174
All rise.

783
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:40,245
All rise.

784
00:58:40,695 --> 00:58:43,926
The great emperor. Esteemed ruler.

785
00:58:44,175 --> 00:58:46,405
Gulistan Taimuri.

786
00:58:46,695 --> 00:58:50,608
The shining star of the empire.

787
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:53,165
His highness.

788
00:58:53,535 --> 00:58:59,167
Emperor Jalaluddin
Akbar is arriving.

789
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:05,770
All rise. All rise.

790
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,530
- Emperor Akbar.
- Glory to him!

791
00:59:08,615 --> 00:59:10,845
- Emperor Akbar.
- Glory to him!

792
00:59:10,935 --> 00:59:13,529
- Emperor Akbar.
- Glory to him!

793
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:17,846
Any news from Malwa, Adham Khan?

794
00:59:18,015 --> 00:59:20,609
We received a reply to Behram
Khan's letter, your majesty.

795
00:59:21,095 --> 00:59:23,609
Shujjat Khan's son Bayezid
Khan has written the letter.

796
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:27,004
- Bayezid Khan?
- Yes, your majesty.

797
00:59:27,535 --> 00:59:29,605
He calls himself Baaz Bahadur.

798
00:59:30,015 --> 00:59:31,084
Insolent.

799
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,605
The flame always burns
bright before dying.

800
00:59:35,015 --> 00:59:37,848
Anyway, what has
Baaz Bahadur written?

801
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:46,608
The Pathan's of Malwa want to
fight us in the battlefield.

802
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:50,088
This isn't a letter
but an invitation to war.

803
00:59:50,535 --> 00:59:53,003
We've been challenged
through this letter.

804
00:59:53,855 --> 00:59:55,607
Will we still stay quiet?

805
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,844
Never!

806
00:59:56,935 --> 00:59:58,607
We'll fight fire with fire.

807
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,845
- Glory to..
- The Moghul empire.

808
01:00:01,695 --> 01:00:03,526
My commander-in-chief, Behram Khan..

809
01:00:03,615 --> 01:00:06,004
Knows the power of
the Pathan's of Malwa.

810
01:00:06,615 --> 01:00:08,412
As he isn't present
here at the moment..

811
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,165
We all should think
twice before taking any step.

812
01:00:12,855 --> 01:00:15,323
Pir Mohammad Khan,
what's your advice?

813
01:00:15,535 --> 01:00:17,526
Your Majesty, the king
of Malwa Shujjat Khan..

814
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:19,173
Won't live for long.

815
01:00:19,535 --> 01:00:21,765
It won't be right to
attack at this moment.

816
01:00:21,935 --> 01:00:24,244
What better moment can we get?

817
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:27,085
Your Majesty,
please give the orders.

818
01:00:27,255 --> 01:00:29,007
And I'll leave with
the troops right away.

819
01:00:29,175 --> 01:00:30,244
Victory will be ours.

820
01:00:31,535 --> 01:00:33,412
No, Adham Khan, we
shouldn't be so hasty.

821
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,591
His majesty would like
to know the advice..

822
01:00:35,615 --> 01:00:36,934
Of my valued musician Tansen.

823
01:00:40,175 --> 01:00:42,530
Your Highness, according to me..

824
01:00:42,615 --> 01:00:45,334
Baaz Bahadur is a great musician.

825
01:00:46,255 --> 01:00:47,455
As soon as Sujaad Singh dies..

826
01:00:47,535 --> 01:00:49,255
He'll be crowned as
the emperor of Malwa.

827
01:00:50,255 --> 01:00:52,086
And Your Highness knows..

828
01:00:52,535 --> 01:00:56,528
A musician has no special
interest in wars and battles.

829
01:00:57,095 --> 01:00:59,529
That's why it won't be difficult..

830
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:02,527
To overpower Baaz
Bahadur at that moment.

831
01:01:03,175 --> 01:01:06,531
Until Shujjat Khan is alive,
there's enmity.

832
01:01:06,615 --> 01:01:07,764
Very nice.

833
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:09,607
I liked this advice.

834
01:01:10,255 --> 01:01:11,324
Did you hear, Adham Khan?

835
01:01:11,855 --> 01:01:14,005
As long as Shujjat Khan is alive..

836
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:16,769
We should drop the
idea of attacking Malwa.

837
01:01:17,335 --> 01:01:20,532
Wonder when that old man will die.

838
01:01:21,015 --> 01:01:24,166
The Moghuls haven't replied yet.

839
01:01:27,015 --> 01:01:29,324
God knows what's going to happen.

840
01:01:30,535 --> 01:01:32,173
Don't worry, Father.

841
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,413
Whatever will
happen will be for good.

842
01:01:44,855 --> 01:01:46,846
It's terrible, Your Highness,
Roopmati..

843
01:01:46,935 --> 01:01:48,846
- What's wrong with her?
- She's fine.

844
01:01:49,015 --> 01:01:51,245
But if she
continues this way, then..

845
01:01:51,615 --> 01:01:53,055
Tell me clearly
what you mean to say.

846
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:57,325
Since she came to
Mandavgarh she doesn't eat or drink.

847
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:02,611
She won't eat until she
doesn't see the Narmada.

848
01:02:03,935 --> 01:02:05,084
That's really bad.

849
01:02:05,935 --> 01:02:09,245
She's our guest, if anything
unearthly happens to her..

850
01:02:09,535 --> 01:02:16,611
- Dear Baaz. Bayezid Khan.
- I'm right here, Father.

851
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,527
Stay close to me, son.

852
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,412
Don't leave me alone.

853
01:02:22,095 --> 01:02:24,848
We haven't received
any reply from Delhi yet.

854
01:02:25,095 --> 01:02:28,405
You don't worry,
Your Majesty, take rest.

855
01:02:28,935 --> 01:02:30,163
Everything will be fine.

856
01:02:31,255 --> 01:02:32,768
Everything will be fine.

857
01:02:34,415 --> 01:02:35,609
Everything will be fine.

858
01:02:37,415 --> 01:02:39,167
Malwa's honour.

859
01:02:44,015 --> 01:02:45,767
- Look, go to Mandav right now.
- Right now?

860
01:02:45,855 --> 01:02:46,924
Yes, right now.

861
01:02:47,255 --> 01:02:50,327
And build a tall dome
on Roopmati's palace.

862
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:53,414
From where she can see the
Narmada and venerate it.

863
01:02:53,535 --> 01:02:54,615
As you wish, Your Highness.

864
01:02:55,535 --> 01:02:56,615
- But Your Highness..
- Yes.

865
01:02:56,695 --> 01:02:57,923
The river is very far away.

866
01:02:58,015 --> 01:02:59,926
How can we build such
a tall dome so quickly?

867
01:03:00,015 --> 01:03:02,529
You can. You can do it in a day.

868
01:03:03,255 --> 01:03:05,255
Employ all the workers of
Mandavgarh for this work.

869
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:07,335
Ask the soldiers of the
army to do their best.

870
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,845
But build the dome
for Roopmati in a day.

871
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:12,295
Tell them its Baaz Bahadur's orders.

872
01:03:12,695 --> 01:03:16,165
If Roopmati dies then I
won't spare anyone. Go.

873
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:17,391
As you wish, I'll leave
for Mandavgarh right now.

874
01:03:17,415 --> 01:03:19,087
- And listen..
- Baaz.

875
01:03:22,535 --> 01:03:24,093
- Father.
- Baaz.

876
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,324
Go on, go quickly.

877
01:03:36,335 --> 01:03:38,087
Father! Father!

878
01:04:13,855 --> 01:04:14,924
Take a look.

879
01:04:15,015 --> 01:04:16,243
There's River Narmada.

880
01:04:28,775 --> 01:04:33,849
Goddess Narmada, I came
here with your permission.

881
01:04:35,535 --> 01:04:37,412
Now, my honour lies in your hands.

882
01:04:38,535 --> 01:04:40,412
It's in your hands, Goddess Narmada.

883
01:04:41,535 --> 01:04:42,604
Princess.

884
01:04:53,415 --> 01:04:54,530
Roopmati.

885
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,333
I have heard, Your Highness.

886
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:07,927
The sultan of Malwa is no more.

887
01:05:08,615 --> 01:05:09,843
What happened was destiny.

888
01:05:10,695 --> 01:05:12,606
But I'll always have a regret that..

889
01:05:13,255 --> 01:05:16,406
I couldn't make him
happy as long as he was alive.

890
01:05:17,615 --> 01:05:19,606
Then please his soul now.

891
01:05:20,535 --> 01:05:22,173
You're the sultan of Malwa.

892
01:05:22,855 --> 01:05:25,528
The responsibility of the
subjects of Malwa rests on you.

893
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,928
Come on, I'll support you.

894
01:05:29,015 --> 01:05:31,165
What are you asking
me to do, Roopmati?

895
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,689
Take a look, Your Highness.

896
01:05:34,335 --> 01:05:38,408
The entire Nimaad province
is turning into a barren land.

897
01:05:39,175 --> 01:05:40,403
If this continues..

898
01:05:40,615 --> 01:05:43,334
- Then Nimaad will turn into a desert.
- No.

899
01:05:43,855 --> 01:05:46,608
- I won't let that happen.
- Then come on.

900
01:05:47,255 --> 01:05:49,325
Goddess Narmada's
blessings are with us.

901
01:05:50,015 --> 01:05:53,166
We'll have to build a canal
from Narmada to Mandavgarh.

902
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:40,526
- Glory to..
- Queen Roopmati!

903
01:07:42,535 --> 01:07:44,526
- Glory to..
- Queen Roopmati!

904
01:07:45,335 --> 01:07:47,166
Glory to Queen Roopmati!

905
01:07:48,015 --> 01:07:49,084
Yes.

906
01:07:49,535 --> 01:07:55,167
The queen that rules the
hearts of Malwa's subjects..

907
01:07:56,255 --> 01:07:58,530
Roopmati has given
new life to Nimaad.

908
01:07:59,015 --> 01:08:01,848
She saved people
from dying of hunger.

909
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:05,247
And I'm a sinner that
blemished a chaste woman.

910
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:06,609
- Glory to..
- Queen Roopmati!

911
01:08:06,935 --> 01:08:08,766
- Glory to..
- Queen Roopmati!

912
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:39,903
- Mother.
- My daughter. My child.

913
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:42,500
You won't leave us this time,
won't you, dear?

914
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:46,501
Look, Baldev Singh
is so sad for you.

915
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:48,423
Forgive me, Roopmati.

916
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,900
You really are chaste
like the water of Narmada.

917
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:54,184
Give me a chance to repent
for the sin that I committed..

918
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:56,830
By falsely defaming you.

919
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:59,659
I'll arrange for
your marriage, dear.

920
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:01,258
Marriage?

921
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,900
I'm already married, Father.

922
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:07,661
- Dear.
- Yes, Father.

923
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:11,657
The day my would-be
husband rejected me..

924
01:09:13,189 --> 01:09:16,340
I devoted myself
to the art of music.

925
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:19,583
I've dedicated my life to that art.

926
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,498
And I'll spend the rest
of my life in its service.

927
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:27,664
- So, won't you forgive me?
- What are you saying?

928
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:32,823
I still respect you
just like I did earlier..

929
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,262
And I always will.

930
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:40,262
Mother, permit me to leave now.

931
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:43,059
And bless me..

932
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:46,503
So that I can serve
Malwa by living in Mandavgarh.

933
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:50,823
Everyone knows how
you served Malwa, dear.

934
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:53,180
But why do you want to stay there.

935
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,660
I went there on
Goddess Narmada's orders.

936
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:59,500
Mandav is a place of worship of art.

937
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,979
And Baaz Bahadur is a
true devotee of art.

938
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:07,182
He's a Pathan, and his
duty is dear to him.

939
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:10,743
I'm a Kshatriya and
my duty is dear to me.

940
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:14,583
But the devotion of music does
not differentiate between duties.

941
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,430
The art of music belongs
to a superior hierarchy.

942
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,579
And together we'll
take it to great heights..

943
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:22,184
That'll make us immortal..

944
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,340
Amongst the
devotees of Indian music.

945
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,818
Mother, allow me to leave.

946
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:31,067
The sultan is waiting for me.

947
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:42,422
One obstruction is out of my path.

948
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:45,059
The other has fallen for Roopmati.

949
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,183
Now the path is clear.

950
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:49,181
But you promised Hamida..

951
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:50,828
To make her the empress of Malwa.

952
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:53,265
That was my ruse.

953
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:56,979
Roopmati is doing
what Hamida couldn't.

954
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:00,068
I wanted Baaz Bahadur to
be engrossed in merriment.

955
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:02,989
And Roopmati is doing
this job fairly well.

956
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,579
Now, we don't need Hamida's help.

957
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:08,182
So, it was your ruse.

958
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:11,420
And to ruin my life.

959
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:15,501
I want to know what you got
from deceiving your daughter.

960
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:18,822
The empire of Malwa is
not small thing, Hamida.

961
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:22,263
Don't you want your father
to become the sultan of Malwa?

962
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:24,341
As far as your
marriage is concerned..

963
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,646
If not Baaz Bahadur we'll
get you married to someone else.

964
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:28,501
No, I won't marry anyone else.

965
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,344
I will marry only
Sultan Baaz Bahadur.

966
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:34,070
- You will have to fulfil your promise.
- Hamida.

967
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:37,185
Roopmati doesn't have
any right on Baaz Bahadur.

968
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:39,501
I'm the empress of Malwa.

969
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,898
I will take my right.

970
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:43,425
And ruin my game plan.

971
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:44,739
Isn't it?

972
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:48,899
Do you know.. Roopmati's
music has the enchantment..

973
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:51,738
To keep him
engrossed all his life.

974
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:53,670
Taking advantage of
this opportunity..

975
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,822
With the help of the Moghuls I
will become the sultan of Malwa.

976
01:11:57,430 --> 01:12:01,423
You.. you will become
the sultan of Malwa.

977
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:07,662
Oh, I never imagined..
That you can stoop so low.

978
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:11,422
Betraying your nation.
Deceiving your ruler.

979
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:12,989
Betraying your master.

980
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:15,342
Then listen carefully.

981
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:17,978
I'm no longer your
daughter nor are you my father.

982
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:19,419
Hamida!

983
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:21,184
Insolent girl!

984
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,261
- What are you doing?
- Leave me.

985
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:28,419
Hamida is your daughter.

986
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,886
She isn't my
daughter she's my enemy.

987
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:31,502
- Leave her.
- I will kill her.

988
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:32,659
Spare her for God's sake.

989
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:34,259
Spare her for God's sake.

990
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:47,739
Take her away and
throw her in the dungeon.

991
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:49,339
I say take her away.

992
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:51,669
For God's sake, don't do that.

993
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:53,343
I beg you.

994
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:55,182
She'll have to stay in the dungeon..

995
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,988
Until I finish my mission.

996
01:12:57,190 --> 01:13:00,500
Give out orders that she should
be kept under strict observation.

997
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:03,263
And if she flees then
I won't spare anyone.

998
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:11,742
"With enchanting eyes
filled with nectar and poison."

999
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:17,184
"A woman draped in white,
red and black."

1000
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:23,348
"Enchants you, enthrals you."

1001
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:28,984
"Each time you think about her."

1002
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,740
"The anklets tinkle."

1003
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,900
"The anklets tinkle."

1004
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:42,188
"I'm on my way to see my beloved."

1005
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:46,420
"The anklets tinkle."

1006
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:55,823
"The night's dark
the path's perilous."

1007
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:03,263
"The night's dark
the path's perilous."

1008
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:06,900
"How do I come to see you, beloved?"

1009
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:08,423
"The partridge sings."

1010
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:10,259
"The partridge sings."

1011
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,419
"It sounds so sweet."

1012
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:13,978
"Makes the heart sway,
gently, gently, gently."

1013
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,185
"The anklets tinkle."

1014
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:22,420
"The anklets tinkle."

1015
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:26,981
"Adorned like a new bride."

1016
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:35,188
"Adorned like a new bride."

1017
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:39,502
"She walks bravely
on the unsafe path."

1018
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:43,822
"It's the onset of spring."

1019
01:14:43,910 --> 01:14:48,188
"Cuckoos singing on every branch."

1020
01:14:50,190 --> 01:14:52,340
"The anklets tinkle."

1021
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:01,824
"Love's blossomed in every element."

1022
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:09,263
"Love's blossomed in every element."

1023
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:12,820
"Affection's blooming in my heart."

1024
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:14,343
"My heart slowly.."

1025
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:15,979
"My heart sings slowly."

1026
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:17,246
"Like the waves of Jamuna ( river)."

1027
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,830
"I walk softly."

1028
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,821
"The anklets tinkle."

1029
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:29,504
"The anklets tinkle."

1030
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:32,988
"The anklets tinkle."

1031
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:36,500
"The anklets tinkle."

1032
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:39,989
"The anklets tinkle."

1033
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,262
"The anklets tinkle."

1034
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:45,181
"The anklets tinkle."

1035
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:46,828
"The anklets tinkle."

1036
01:15:54,590 --> 01:16:00,586
"The anklets tinkle."

1037
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:09,148
"The anklets tinkle."

1038
01:16:09,172 --> 01:16:11,732
From Mandav to Sarangpur
and Sarangpur to Mandav.

1039
01:16:12,012 --> 01:16:13,889
From there to here.
And here to there again.

1040
01:16:14,092 --> 01:16:16,811
I wonder why I ever left Mandavgarh.

1041
01:16:17,092 --> 01:16:19,242
I didn't get a day's rest.

1042
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,005
Did you receive
any news from Mandav?

1043
01:16:21,332 --> 01:16:22,560
When is the prince returning?

1044
01:16:22,732 --> 01:16:25,485
Stop thinking that
he'll return, Khan sir.

1045
01:16:25,652 --> 01:16:27,882
He's no longer prince Bayezid Khan.

1046
01:16:28,092 --> 01:16:30,322
He's Sultan Baaz Bahadur.

1047
01:16:31,012 --> 01:16:32,809
So what if he's the sultan..

1048
01:16:33,012 --> 01:16:36,482
- He's still my student.
- What teacher and what student.

1049
01:16:36,652 --> 01:16:38,643
Those days are over, Khan sir.

1050
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:40,411
- Tansen.
- Oh, my.

1051
01:16:42,332 --> 01:16:44,243
Prepare to leave for Mandav.

1052
01:16:44,732 --> 01:16:48,645
- Sultan Baaz Bahadur has called you.
- Okay.

1053
01:16:49,092 --> 01:16:50,730
- Let's go, Khan sir.
- No.

1054
01:16:51,012 --> 01:16:54,721
- Khan sir will stay here.
- I get it.

1055
01:16:55,012 --> 01:16:57,242
Now, you want to learn music.

1056
01:16:57,332 --> 01:16:58,811
- But pardon me..
- Quiet!

1057
01:16:58,892 --> 01:17:00,086
Prepare to leave.

1058
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:03,891
Take a seat, Khan sir.

1059
01:17:06,412 --> 01:17:09,245
I never thought his majesty
Baaz Bahadur would be like this.

1060
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:11,212
He showed his true colours..

1061
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,890
As soon as he got
the reign of Mandva,

1062
01:17:13,012 --> 01:17:14,889
Why? What has he done?

1063
01:17:15,732 --> 01:17:18,724
Ask what he hasn't done.

1064
01:17:20,012 --> 01:17:25,405
He has said that he doesn't
need your guidance to learn music.

1065
01:17:25,492 --> 01:17:26,561
What did you say?

1066
01:17:26,652 --> 01:17:28,244
He doesn't need me now.

1067
01:17:28,492 --> 01:17:30,881
No, no, that can't be true.

1068
01:17:31,012 --> 01:17:32,132
I'll go to Mandav right now.

1069
01:17:32,172 --> 01:17:35,323
You'll only cause yourself
humiliation by going to Mandav.

1070
01:17:35,492 --> 01:17:38,006
Rani Roopmati's
orders are followed there.

1071
01:17:38,172 --> 01:17:40,322
She's the one that sacked you.

1072
01:17:40,732 --> 01:17:42,006
Rani Roopmati!

1073
01:17:42,172 --> 01:17:44,402
How dare that ignorant girl.

1074
01:17:44,492 --> 01:17:47,882
She teaches music to Baaz now.

1075
01:17:48,412 --> 01:17:49,481
Oh, my.

1076
01:17:49,652 --> 01:17:50,721
Curses.

1077
01:17:51,012 --> 01:17:52,491
Such importance to a petty girl.

1078
01:17:52,732 --> 01:17:57,010
If that's true, then I won't
step on the soils of Mandav again.

1079
01:17:57,332 --> 01:18:01,007
No one can tolerate the
insult of an artist like you.

1080
01:18:01,732 --> 01:18:04,405
Though a student yet
Baaz doesn't respect you.

1081
01:18:05,172 --> 01:18:08,403
I wish.. if you were in Delhi..

1082
01:18:09,012 --> 01:18:12,641
Moghul emperor Jalaluddin
Akbar would've honoured you.

1083
01:18:13,412 --> 01:18:15,562
I'm not so fortunate.

1084
01:18:16,332 --> 01:18:17,852
But my desire is to
display my talent..

1085
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:22,406
Before an assessor like
the Moghul emperor Akbar.

1086
01:18:22,492 --> 01:18:23,561
That's all.

1087
01:18:23,652 --> 01:18:25,005
Give me five.

1088
01:18:25,092 --> 01:18:26,810
Those are my thoughts as well.

1089
01:18:27,012 --> 01:18:28,161
Come on, get ready.

1090
01:18:28,252 --> 01:18:30,004
You've to leave for Delhi.

1091
01:18:30,092 --> 01:18:31,320
Right now.

1092
01:18:31,492 --> 01:18:33,722
I'll give you a letter
addressed to emperor Akbar.

1093
01:18:34,012 --> 01:18:37,322
If God wills then you'll
be one of his nine gems.

1094
01:18:37,572 --> 01:18:40,484
Really? May God
bless you with long life.

1095
01:18:40,812 --> 01:18:43,167
Sir, you saved my honour.

1096
01:18:44,172 --> 01:18:46,083
The singer from Malwa, Maan Khan..

1097
01:18:46,252 --> 01:18:48,482
Would like to come in the court.

1098
01:18:48,732 --> 01:18:51,405
- Maan Khan.
- Permission granted.

1099
01:18:56,172 --> 01:18:59,482
Tansen. Have you ever heard him?

1100
01:18:59,732 --> 01:19:01,245
I have not, your majesty.

1101
01:19:02,012 --> 01:19:04,003
But he's very famous in Malwa.

1102
01:19:04,412 --> 01:19:07,006
He has taught music to Baaz Bahadur.

1103
01:19:07,172 --> 01:19:09,003
Hail the emperor of India!

1104
01:19:20,012 --> 01:19:22,242
His majesty has heard of your fame.

1105
01:19:23,012 --> 01:19:24,491
You're very famous in Malwa.

1106
01:19:27,172 --> 01:19:28,321
Whose letter is this?

1107
01:19:28,492 --> 01:19:31,006
The commander-in-chief
of Malwa, Hafiz Khan.

1108
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,650
How dare that Baaz Bahadur..

1109
01:19:47,012 --> 01:19:50,004
Hafiz Khan has
written that Baaz Bahadur..

1110
01:19:50,092 --> 01:19:51,320
Wants to attack Delhi.

1111
01:19:51,812 --> 01:19:53,882
No, no, Your Highness, that's wrong.

1112
01:19:54,172 --> 01:19:56,561
Baaz Bahadur can never
have such intentions.

1113
01:19:56,732 --> 01:19:58,802
He doesn't have time from his music.

1114
01:19:59,172 --> 01:20:00,890
Hafiz Khan must be surely mistaken.

1115
01:20:01,332 --> 01:20:05,325
I feel this letter is a conspiracy,
Your Highness.

1116
01:20:05,732 --> 01:20:08,326
There's no conspiracy.

1117
01:20:08,812 --> 01:20:11,406
It's exactly what I feared.

1118
01:20:11,732 --> 01:20:13,563
If we had attacked back then..

1119
01:20:13,732 --> 01:20:15,723
Then we wouldn't be
facing this situation.

1120
01:20:16,012 --> 01:20:17,628
We haven't lost
anything yet, Your Highness.

1121
01:20:17,652 --> 01:20:19,722
Give the orders, our army is ready.

1122
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:21,161
Wait, Adham Khan.

1123
01:20:21,732 --> 01:20:23,245
Have patience.

1124
01:20:23,492 --> 01:20:26,165
It's the consequences
of old mistakes, Tansen.

1125
01:20:27,012 --> 01:20:28,809
Maybe Bayezid Khan doesn't know..

1126
01:20:29,332 --> 01:20:32,881
How I have been
ignoring the Pathans of Malwa.

1127
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,323
But now the situation
has gone beyond control.

1128
01:20:35,492 --> 01:20:37,801
We'll have to conquer Malwa quickly.

1129
01:20:38,092 --> 01:20:41,482
Adham Khan, give the orders to
the troops to march forward.

1130
01:20:41,572 --> 01:20:42,721
As you wish, Your Highness.

1131
01:20:42,892 --> 01:20:44,484
Pardon me, Your Highness.

1132
01:20:46,012 --> 01:20:49,482
I'll put my life at
stake but avert this war.

1133
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,003
I'm absolutely sure
that he'll reveal..

1134
01:20:52,092 --> 01:20:53,852
The conspiracy
behind Hafiz Khan's letter.

1135
01:20:54,492 --> 01:20:56,562
Baaz Bahadur won't attack Delhi.

1136
01:20:56,812 --> 01:20:58,132
I take full responsibility of it.

1137
01:20:58,172 --> 01:21:00,003
It's my insult, Your Highness.

1138
01:21:00,492 --> 01:21:03,006
If every member of the
court starts interfering..

1139
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:04,868
In political decisions
then there's no use of us.

1140
01:21:04,892 --> 01:21:06,007
Wait, Adham Khan.

1141
01:21:07,492 --> 01:21:09,323
What do you want?

1142
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:12,087
Give me one chance, Your Highness.

1143
01:21:12,892 --> 01:21:17,488
I want to go to Mandav and
test Baaz Bahadur and Roopmati.

1144
01:21:18,172 --> 01:21:19,810
If they're true artists..

1145
01:21:20,092 --> 01:21:22,322
Then this information
about attacking Delhi is wrong.

1146
01:21:22,492 --> 01:21:24,244
There's danger.

1147
01:21:24,892 --> 01:21:26,405
I won't let you go alone.

1148
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:28,809
I'm an artist, Your Highness.

1149
01:21:30,412 --> 01:21:33,484
I don't have any enmity
against the Moghuls or the Pathans.

1150
01:21:34,332 --> 01:21:38,723
Yes, but I do want
Delhi and Malwa to unite.

1151
01:21:39,012 --> 01:21:40,148
Moghuls and Pathans
that have drifted apart..

1152
01:21:40,172 --> 01:21:41,400
Join hands once again.

1153
01:21:41,492 --> 01:21:44,006
Your sentiments have
pleased me, Tansen.

1154
01:21:44,652 --> 01:21:46,244
I give you the permission to go.

1155
01:21:46,332 --> 01:21:47,708
But, your majesty, this isn't right.

1156
01:21:47,732 --> 01:21:50,724
And yes, do take some
handpicked soldiers along.

1157
01:21:51,012 --> 01:21:52,889
Don't worry about anything,
Your Highness.

1158
01:21:53,572 --> 01:21:55,085
My art is with me.

1159
01:22:01,332 --> 01:22:02,401
Where did Hamida go?

1160
01:22:03,092 --> 01:22:05,322
Did the walls of the
dungeon swallow her?

1161
01:22:05,412 --> 01:22:06,640
Sir, we don't know anything.

1162
01:22:06,732 --> 01:22:08,006
You don't know.

1163
01:22:08,092 --> 01:22:09,411
I know everything.

1164
01:22:09,732 --> 01:22:11,563
All of you are in this.

1165
01:22:12,012 --> 01:22:13,491
I'll hang each one of you.

1166
01:22:13,812 --> 01:22:17,805
If you value your life
then go and find her.

1167
01:22:18,012 --> 01:22:19,081
Dead or alive.

1168
01:22:28,012 --> 01:22:29,491
It's night time.

1169
01:22:30,332 --> 01:22:32,004
The bee is trapped in the flower.

1170
01:22:33,332 --> 01:22:35,641
Only the rays of the
sun have the capability..

1171
01:22:36,412 --> 01:22:39,165
To make the flower
blossom and release the bee.

1172
01:22:41,012 --> 01:22:43,321
I beg your pardon, Your Highness.

1173
01:22:44,012 --> 01:22:46,401
Real magic has the
power to enchant everyone.

1174
01:22:47,252 --> 01:22:50,722
Elders have said that
music has the power..

1175
01:22:51,012 --> 01:22:52,491
To turn night into day.

1176
01:22:52,812 --> 01:22:55,724
To make the flower
blossom and release the bee.

1177
01:23:01,572 --> 01:23:04,006
There's a big difference in
saying and doing it, old man.

1178
01:23:05,012 --> 01:23:07,401
The miracles of music
have only been heard of..

1179
01:23:08,252 --> 01:23:09,468
But no one ever has ever seen it.

1180
01:23:09,492 --> 01:23:11,642
You need that power in
the melody, Your Highness.

1181
01:23:12,492 --> 01:23:15,006
Turning night into
day is nothing unique.

1182
01:23:16,012 --> 01:23:19,004
The singers of Malwa
are famed in India.

1183
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:22,565
Famous musicians are
present in your court.

1184
01:23:23,172 --> 01:23:26,642
I'm sure if any
musician musters the courage..

1185
01:23:27,012 --> 01:23:29,252
Then the poor bee will be
released from the captivity.

1186
01:23:43,412 --> 01:23:45,243
I've a request, old man.

1187
01:23:46,412 --> 01:23:48,164
I never seen such a
miracle ever before.

1188
01:23:49,172 --> 01:23:53,085
If music really has that
power then please begin.

1189
01:23:54,012 --> 01:23:57,243
Yes, I would like to
hear such music as well.

1190
01:23:57,652 --> 01:23:58,721
Please begin.

1191
01:24:37,012 --> 01:24:39,082
"Fly away."

1192
01:24:39,172 --> 01:24:41,732
"Fly away."

1193
01:24:41,812 --> 01:24:49,812
"Fly away, bee, from the
captivity of the alluring lotus."

1194
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:59,252
"Fly away, bee, from the
captivity of the alluring lotus."

1195
01:25:00,732 --> 01:25:03,166
"Fly away bee."

1196
01:25:06,012 --> 01:25:10,722
"It's red in colour."

1197
01:25:15,332 --> 01:25:19,405
"It's red in colour."

1198
01:25:19,492 --> 01:25:24,566
"Its features are
beautiful as well."

1199
01:25:24,812 --> 01:25:30,011
"The petals you swing on."

1200
01:25:30,092 --> 01:25:38,092
"The petals you
swing on are a trap."

1201
01:25:40,652 --> 01:25:48,652
"Go and find another love."

1202
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:54,249
"Leave this flower."

1203
01:25:54,332 --> 01:25:56,800
"Fly away bee."

1204
01:25:59,732 --> 01:26:07,732
"Look, the rays of the
sun are approaching you."

1205
01:26:09,012 --> 01:26:13,563
"Fly towards the sky."

1206
01:26:13,652 --> 01:26:18,089
"With the wind in your face."

1207
01:26:18,252 --> 01:26:26,252
"Fly away, bee, from
this comfortable bee."

1208
01:26:27,332 --> 01:26:35,332
"You're black in colour so
clear the darkness in your mind."

1209
01:26:37,332 --> 01:26:42,486
"The morning.."

1210
01:26:42,732 --> 01:26:50,732
"The morning calls out to you."

1211
01:26:51,892 --> 01:26:59,892
"Fly away bee, from the
captivity of the alluring lotus."

1212
01:27:00,252 --> 01:27:02,322
"Fly away bee."

1213
01:27:11,412 --> 01:27:12,811
"Fly away. Fly away."

1214
01:27:12,892 --> 01:27:14,644
"Fly away."

1215
01:27:22,012 --> 01:27:25,243
"Fly away bee. Fly away bee."

1216
01:27:25,412 --> 01:27:29,007
"Fly away bee. Fly away bee."

1217
01:27:29,092 --> 01:27:33,005
"Fly away bee. Fly away bee."

1218
01:27:42,492 --> 01:27:44,722
"Fly away bee."

1219
01:27:59,652 --> 01:28:01,244
"Fly away bee."

1220
01:28:01,732 --> 01:28:04,246
"Fly away bee, from the
captivity of the alluring lotus."

1221
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:07,085
"Fly away bee, from the
captivity of the alluring lotus."

1222
01:28:07,172 --> 01:28:09,732
"Fly away."

1223
01:28:09,812 --> 01:28:13,009
"Fly away."

1224
01:28:34,412 --> 01:28:37,006
Wow! Wow! Wow!

1225
01:28:57,012 --> 01:29:04,407
"Why did you fly away?"

1226
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:10,245
"Is this your love?"

1227
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:18,009
"The lotus cries out and wails."

1228
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:24,088
"The days of
springs won't last long."

1229
01:29:24,172 --> 01:29:25,241
"Come back."

1230
01:29:25,332 --> 01:29:28,722
"Come back, bee, the path's
forlorn, the abode's lonely."

1231
01:29:28,812 --> 01:29:30,404
"Come back."

1232
01:29:31,012 --> 01:29:32,081
"Come back."

1233
01:29:32,172 --> 01:29:37,007
"Come back, bee, the path's
forlorn, the abode's lonely."

1234
01:29:37,092 --> 01:29:38,241
"Don't trouble me."

1235
01:29:38,492 --> 01:29:40,005
"Come back."

1236
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:43,482
"My eyes are sad,
waiting for your glimpse."

1237
01:29:43,572 --> 01:29:47,008
"Waiting for you to
return every moment."

1238
01:29:47,092 --> 01:29:48,161
"Come back."

1239
01:29:48,252 --> 01:29:51,324
"Come back, bee, the path's
forlorn, the abode's lonely."

1240
01:29:51,412 --> 01:29:53,004
"Come back."

1241
01:29:53,492 --> 01:29:54,811
"Come back."

1242
01:29:55,012 --> 01:29:57,572
"Hearing your hum."

1243
01:29:57,652 --> 01:30:01,565
"I've lost my senses."

1244
01:30:01,652 --> 01:30:04,007
"Hearing your hum."

1245
01:30:04,092 --> 01:30:07,562
"I've lost my senses."

1246
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:09,165
"Tormentor."

1247
01:30:09,252 --> 01:30:10,321
"Come back."

1248
01:30:10,412 --> 01:30:13,802
"Come back bee, the path's forlorn,
the abode's lonely."

1249
01:30:13,892 --> 01:30:15,484
"Come back."

1250
01:30:21,732 --> 01:30:24,485
"Come back bee, the path's forlorn,
the abode's lonely."

1251
01:30:26,652 --> 01:30:28,005
"Come back."

1252
01:30:28,092 --> 01:30:30,003
"Come back."

1253
01:30:33,412 --> 01:30:35,004
"Come back, bee.."

1254
01:30:39,012 --> 01:30:40,081
"Come back."

1255
01:30:40,172 --> 01:30:43,323
"Come back, bee, the path's
forlorn, the abode's lonely."

1256
01:30:43,412 --> 01:30:44,640
"Come back."

1257
01:31:19,012 --> 01:31:21,401
Hail the Meera of Malwa.

1258
01:31:25,172 --> 01:31:27,003
- Glory to..
- Meera of Malwa.

1259
01:31:27,172 --> 01:31:29,083
- Glory to..
- Meera of Malwa.

1260
01:31:29,652 --> 01:31:31,563
- Glory to..
- Meera of Malwa.

1261
01:31:38,412 --> 01:31:39,481
Tansen.

1262
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:41,731
The sultan of music.

1263
01:31:43,012 --> 01:31:46,800
- Tansen.
- Yes, I'm Tansen.

1264
01:31:55,172 --> 01:31:56,321
I'm so fortunate.

1265
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:11,324
Pardon me.

1266
01:32:12,012 --> 01:32:17,644
I would've dared if I had
known it was Tansen himself.

1267
01:32:18,012 --> 01:32:19,650
Bless you, Rani Roopmati.

1268
01:32:20,652 --> 01:32:24,008
You're exactly like
I heard about you.

1269
01:32:31,492 --> 01:32:32,720
Shining star of music.

1270
01:32:33,412 --> 01:32:35,482
I had a great desire
to listen to your music.

1271
01:32:36,172 --> 01:32:37,321
It's been fulfilled today.

1272
01:32:38,092 --> 01:32:40,652
But why are you disguised this way.

1273
01:32:41,012 --> 01:32:43,810
I'm here to ask you something,
Your Majesty.

1274
01:32:44,412 --> 01:32:46,801
What can I give to
an artist like you?

1275
01:32:48,252 --> 01:32:49,321
Still, please go ahead.

1276
01:32:49,412 --> 01:32:52,643
Promise me, you'll give
me anything I ask for.

1277
01:32:54,252 --> 01:32:56,243
I promise you, Tansen.

1278
01:32:57,012 --> 01:32:59,242
You can ask me for the Malwa empire.

1279
01:32:59,732 --> 01:33:01,802
And I'll stay near
your feet as a beggar.

1280
01:33:02,092 --> 01:33:06,563
No, Sultan, I don't
want the empire of Malwa.

1281
01:33:07,732 --> 01:33:09,068
I'm here to extend a
hand of friendship..

1282
01:33:09,092 --> 01:33:11,322
On behalf of emperor Akbar.

1283
01:33:12,172 --> 01:33:16,245
Can't the Moghuls and
Pathans live in India as friends?

1284
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:21,801
You know that my father
battled the Moghuls all his life.

1285
01:33:22,412 --> 01:33:25,722
And he didn't bow to the
Moghul reign until his last breath.

1286
01:33:26,172 --> 01:33:28,402
No one has to bow down.

1287
01:33:29,092 --> 01:33:31,811
I'm extending a hand of
friendship on behalf of the Moghuls.

1288
01:33:32,412 --> 01:33:37,008
If the Pathan's envy battles,
bloodshed and slaughter..

1289
01:33:37,172 --> 01:33:39,083
And love peace and harmony.

1290
01:33:39,332 --> 01:33:42,404
Then we can forget our
past enmities and mistakes..

1291
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:43,720
And embrace each other.

1292
01:33:44,172 --> 01:33:45,730
Brave Pathans of Malwa.

1293
01:33:46,092 --> 01:33:47,571
I ask you.

1294
01:33:48,092 --> 01:33:50,811
Won't you accept my
hand of friendship?

1295
01:33:50,892 --> 01:33:53,167
Of course! Of course! Of course!

1296
01:33:53,252 --> 01:33:56,881
Then come, let's
together voice our opinion.

1297
01:33:57,012 --> 01:33:59,003
- Moghul Pathan.
- Glory to them!

1298
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:00,889
- Moghul Pathan.
- Glory to them!

1299
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:04,321
Deliver my message to
the Moghul emperor Akbar.

1300
01:34:04,892 --> 01:34:06,068
That Baaz has
forgotten the old enmity..

1301
01:34:06,092 --> 01:34:08,322
Between the Pathans and Moghuls.

1302
01:34:09,252 --> 01:34:12,324
And that day isn't far
when we'll hug each other..

1303
01:34:12,412 --> 01:34:13,481
And say..

1304
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:15,802
- Long live..
- India!

1305
01:34:16,012 --> 01:34:18,003
- Long live..
- Moghul Pathan!

1306
01:34:18,732 --> 01:34:22,008
Every artist.

1307
01:34:22,172 --> 01:34:25,403
Tansen, Maan Khan,
Baaz Bahadur, Akbar.

1308
01:34:25,572 --> 01:34:26,721
They all want peace.

1309
01:34:26,892 --> 01:34:28,007
They want to compromise.

1310
01:34:28,172 --> 01:34:29,321
Cowards.

1311
01:34:30,092 --> 01:34:32,003
If I had gone to Delhi myself..

1312
01:34:32,092 --> 01:34:34,560
Instead of sending
that singer Maan Khan..

1313
01:34:34,732 --> 01:34:36,492
Then this situation
would've never arisen.

1314
01:34:36,732 --> 01:34:38,404
All my plans have been foiled.

1315
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:42,810
What are your orders for me?

1316
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:46,084
Should I return to Mandavgarh?

1317
01:34:47,012 --> 01:34:51,403
Yes, but listen. But
you've to be careful.

1318
01:34:51,732 --> 01:34:54,007
Take some handpicked
troops along and hide them..

1319
01:34:54,092 --> 01:34:57,562
In the jungles outside
the limits of Mandavgarh.

1320
01:34:57,732 --> 01:34:58,801
And..

1321
01:35:02,732 --> 01:35:03,881
As you wish, sir.

1322
01:37:40,372 --> 01:37:42,408
Fantastic! Marvellous!

1323
01:37:43,132 --> 01:37:46,841
Who are you? Are you
a fairy from heaven?

1324
01:37:47,052 --> 01:37:49,930
Queen, I'm an ordinary artist.

1325
01:37:50,332 --> 01:37:53,165
I had a great desire to
show you my talent once.

1326
01:37:53,532 --> 01:37:55,807
But the soldiers
stopped me at the gate.

1327
01:37:55,892 --> 01:37:59,009
So, I had to come to
you at night stealthily.

1328
01:37:59,092 --> 01:38:00,491
Come here.

1329
01:38:01,332 --> 01:38:04,130
So, you want to show me your dance.

1330
01:38:04,212 --> 01:38:06,123
Not only dance, but
also singing and music..

1331
01:38:06,212 --> 01:38:10,091
I want to show you
all the talent I possess.

1332
01:38:10,332 --> 01:38:14,086
I have come to you
because you value talent.

1333
01:38:14,172 --> 01:38:16,527
Very good. Why do you've
to ask for this good deed?

1334
01:38:17,052 --> 01:38:20,647
I'll really pamper
an artist like you.

1335
01:38:21,372 --> 01:38:22,691
Is anyone here?

1336
01:38:23,092 --> 01:38:25,401
Champa? Hira?

1337
01:38:28,012 --> 01:38:31,687
Look, you exhibit your
talent at the court tomorrow.

1338
01:38:32,252 --> 01:38:33,810
What is your name?

1339
01:38:34,212 --> 01:38:38,205
My name.. my name is Bhanumati.

1340
01:38:39,252 --> 01:38:40,446
Bhanumati?

1341
01:38:40,532 --> 01:38:42,363
You called me, Queen?

1342
01:38:42,452 --> 01:38:46,047
Yes, Sakhi. Make
arrangement for her stay.

1343
01:38:46,452 --> 01:38:48,647
I'll introduce her to the
emperor tomorrow morning.

1344
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:51,726
- He will be overjoyed to meet you.
- Okay.

1345
01:38:51,932 --> 01:38:54,207
Now, go and take rest.

1346
01:39:03,052 --> 01:39:07,409
Bhanumati is such
a beautiful artist.

1347
01:39:09,372 --> 01:39:11,727
She is a great artist, Your Majesty.

1348
01:39:12,612 --> 01:39:14,284
Her name is Bhanumati.

1349
01:39:14,372 --> 01:39:18,251
Your Majesty, I want to
show you such a dance..

1350
01:39:18,652 --> 01:39:22,122
Which you would have
never seen or heard.

1351
01:39:22,292 --> 01:39:25,762
Really? Then I will
definitely see your dance.

1352
01:39:26,212 --> 01:39:31,650
But Your Majesty, I will risk
my life and perform this dance.

1353
01:39:32,212 --> 01:39:36,763
So, promise me that you will
give anything I ask in return.

1354
01:39:37,252 --> 01:39:40,881
No doubt. I know
talent is priceless.

1355
01:39:41,452 --> 01:39:45,411
But still we promise that
we'll give you whatever you ask.

1356
01:39:45,892 --> 01:39:47,007
Thanks.

1357
01:39:47,492 --> 01:39:50,131
What did you say? Hamida
has reached the Mandav?

1358
01:39:50,852 --> 01:39:56,370
Oh! What if she unfolds
my secret to Baaz Bahadur?

1359
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:59,808
Tomorrow morning, she will dance
on the rope by risking her life.

1360
01:39:59,892 --> 01:40:01,962
- Then?
- Emperor has promised her..

1361
01:40:02,052 --> 01:40:04,646
That after the dance is over,
she will get whatever she asks.

1362
01:40:04,852 --> 01:40:06,604
Did you understand
what she will ask?

1363
01:40:08,132 --> 01:40:10,965
She will marry Baaz and
become the queen of Malwa.

1364
01:40:11,212 --> 01:40:13,248
Then she will reveal all my secrets.

1365
01:40:13,332 --> 01:40:15,562
She wants to ruin my entire plan.

1366
01:40:15,772 --> 01:40:17,524
But I will never let it happen.

1367
01:40:17,612 --> 01:40:19,728
I will kill her before that.

1368
01:40:20,412 --> 01:40:24,371
I will also risk my life
to become the king of Malwa.

1369
01:43:08,972 --> 01:43:10,291
Hamida?

1370
01:43:13,772 --> 01:43:16,570
No need to worry. I've
given her the medicine.

1371
01:43:16,652 --> 01:43:18,882
Call me as soon she
regains consciousness.

1372
01:43:20,332 --> 01:43:22,687
What did you say?
Hamida has survived?

1373
01:43:23,052 --> 01:43:25,407
Oh! This is real bad.

1374
01:43:25,652 --> 01:43:28,371
Now Baaz will come to know
all the secrets through her.

1375
01:43:36,852 --> 01:43:40,401
Sir, Mr. Tansen has left
Mandav to reach Delhi.

1376
01:43:40,492 --> 01:43:42,369
- Who is along with him?
- No one, sir.

1377
01:43:42,452 --> 01:43:45,012
Our work is done.
Sher Khan, go soon.

1378
01:43:45,092 --> 01:43:48,243
Arrest that singer as soon he
crosses the border of Mandav.

1379
01:43:48,332 --> 01:43:50,482
- As you say, sir.
- And listen.

1380
01:43:50,572 --> 01:43:51,788
Take him directly to
my fort in Sarangpur..

1381
01:43:51,812 --> 01:43:54,280
And imprison him there. Go soon.

1382
01:43:54,452 --> 01:43:57,524
Azim, you leave for Delhi right now.

1383
01:43:57,612 --> 01:43:59,842
- Right now?
- Right now. And listen..

1384
01:44:09,412 --> 01:44:12,006
What's wrong? What do you all want?

1385
01:44:12,092 --> 01:44:15,243
We want you, sir.
Get down of the horse.

1386
01:44:20,612 --> 01:44:24,685
What is this? You all
definitely have some misunderstanding.

1387
01:44:25,532 --> 01:44:27,727
Perhaps you have not recognised me.

1388
01:44:27,812 --> 01:44:32,124
We recognise you well,
sir. You are Mr. Tansen.

1389
01:44:32,412 --> 01:44:33,925
We have arrested
you on the command..

1390
01:44:34,012 --> 01:44:35,452
Of the army commander Hafiz Khan.

1391
01:44:35,492 --> 01:44:39,007
- Why?
- We don't know. But you can't go to Delhi now.

1392
01:44:39,092 --> 01:44:40,161
Take him along.

1393
01:44:40,252 --> 01:44:42,322
No, no. Please let me go to Delhi.

1394
01:44:42,412 --> 01:44:45,961
If I don't reach on time, the
Moghul army will attack Malwa.

1395
01:44:47,172 --> 01:44:49,686
Don't laugh. Your
Malwa will be destroyed.

1396
01:44:50,612 --> 01:44:52,011
I say, let me go.

1397
01:44:53,572 --> 01:44:54,908
Miscreants, if only
one me, then have mercy..

1398
01:44:54,932 --> 01:44:56,843
On the subjects of Malwa.

1399
01:44:58,052 --> 01:45:00,691
Leave me. Let me go. Let me go.

1400
01:45:00,892 --> 01:45:03,804
What did you say? The
great musician is arrested?

1401
01:45:04,052 --> 01:45:06,805
Army commander Hafiz Khan
placated a lot, Your Majesty..

1402
01:45:06,972 --> 01:45:08,812
But the emperor
didn't listen to him at all.

1403
01:45:10,772 --> 01:45:13,332
So that has happened what I feared.

1404
01:45:13,852 --> 01:45:19,085
But tell His Majesty for
what crime is Tansen arrested?

1405
01:45:19,292 --> 01:45:23,365
He had appealed to king Baaz
Bahadur and queen Roopmati..

1406
01:45:23,612 --> 01:45:28,970
To visit His Majesty's
court and show his talent once.

1407
01:45:29,172 --> 01:45:32,084
The emperor went mad
with rage on hearing it.

1408
01:45:32,972 --> 01:45:35,327
Tansen didn't say anything wrong.

1409
01:45:35,852 --> 01:45:37,683
It is a great
honour for a musician..

1410
01:45:37,772 --> 01:45:40,081
To exhibit his
talent at the Delhi court.

1411
01:45:40,172 --> 01:45:43,642
Your Majesty, Roopmati also
said that if the emperor..

1412
01:45:43,732 --> 01:45:45,768
Is so interested
in hearing the song..

1413
01:45:45,852 --> 01:45:48,161
I sing the songs of
wars very melodiously.

1414
01:45:48,292 --> 01:45:51,762
I'll sing it to him when I'll
meet him at that battlefield.

1415
01:45:51,852 --> 01:45:55,561
This girl dares to
challenge me to fight a war?

1416
01:45:55,972 --> 01:45:58,770
Adham Khan, attack Malwa right now..

1417
01:45:58,932 --> 01:46:01,048
And spread
destruction in entire Mandav.

1418
01:46:01,132 --> 01:46:03,407
- Emperor Akbar.
- Live long.

1419
01:46:03,572 --> 01:46:05,802
- Moghul Emperor.
- Live long.

1420
01:46:05,892 --> 01:46:09,885
- But listen..
- No harm should be done to Roopmati.

1421
01:46:10,932 --> 01:46:14,004
After attacking Mandav
your first work is to..

1422
01:46:14,292 --> 01:46:16,886
Reach Roopmati
safe and sound to Delhi.

1423
01:46:17,652 --> 01:46:20,371
I will include her in
the nine gems of the court.

1424
01:46:20,732 --> 01:46:22,768
Be assured, Your Majesty.

1425
01:46:23,292 --> 01:46:25,965
I will arrest Baaz
Bahadur and Roopmati..

1426
01:46:26,052 --> 01:46:27,644
And present them before you.

1427
01:46:27,732 --> 01:46:29,882
- It is my duty.
- You may go.

1428
01:46:31,372 --> 01:46:35,331
I have come to snatch the
throne and king of Malwa.

1429
01:46:35,772 --> 01:46:42,769
Hamida, neither the throne nor
the king of Malwa belongs to me.

1430
01:46:44,012 --> 01:46:45,491
Then how will you snatch it from me?

1431
01:46:45,572 --> 01:46:50,282
I know everything. You are the
ruler of Malwa and king's queen.

1432
01:46:51,332 --> 01:46:54,165
Well, I'm nothing.

1433
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:58,564
But as you have shown your
talent by risking your life..

1434
01:46:59,412 --> 01:47:02,484
So according to the promise,
you want to marry..

1435
01:47:02,572 --> 01:47:06,485
Baaz Bahadur and become
the queen of Malwa, right?

1436
01:47:07,332 --> 01:47:10,802
The emperor will have
to fulfil his promise.

1437
01:47:11,132 --> 01:47:14,090
But you don't want
to leave your place.

1438
01:47:14,292 --> 01:47:17,762
That's why you cut the rope
and tried to kill me dishonestly.

1439
01:47:18,132 --> 01:47:23,126
You are so innocent. Come on,
I'll take you to Baaz Bahadur.

1440
01:47:23,212 --> 01:47:26,124
You don't have to come.
I'll go to him.

1441
01:47:26,212 --> 01:47:27,440
Roop.

1442
01:47:29,492 --> 01:47:30,811
Your Majesty.

1443
01:47:33,852 --> 01:47:35,444
We were just coming to you.

1444
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:37,045
Why? What's wrong?

1445
01:47:37,412 --> 01:47:41,644
You had promised Hamida that
you will give her whatever..

1446
01:47:41,892 --> 01:47:43,308
She demands in return
of performing her dance.

1447
01:47:43,332 --> 01:47:45,368
Yes. I will definitely give.

1448
01:47:45,932 --> 01:47:50,767
Hamida, tell me. What do you want?

1449
01:47:54,972 --> 01:47:57,440
Tell me. What do you want?

1450
01:47:59,372 --> 01:48:00,725
I will tell you.

1451
01:48:01,692 --> 01:48:06,891
It is not only her
desire but mine too..

1452
01:48:08,572 --> 01:48:11,609
That you marry her and
make her the queen of Malwa.

1453
01:48:11,772 --> 01:48:12,921
Roop?

1454
01:48:16,772 --> 01:48:19,684
Why? Do you have any objection?

1455
01:48:20,172 --> 01:48:23,528
I don't have any objection. But..

1456
01:48:23,612 --> 01:48:27,002
No, Your Majesty. You give
your consent immediately..

1457
01:48:27,532 --> 01:48:30,126
And I'll make preparations
for my darling sister's wedding.

1458
01:48:32,852 --> 01:48:35,002
- Queen.
- Oh, what are you doing?

1459
01:48:35,452 --> 01:48:39,161
No. A girl like me is
fit to be at your feet.

1460
01:48:39,692 --> 01:48:44,049
Queen, you are not a
human but an angel.

1461
01:48:44,812 --> 01:48:47,201
You have made me
the queen in no time.

1462
01:48:48,452 --> 01:48:53,651
- And I? I had come to kill you.
- Hamida?

1463
01:48:58,812 --> 01:49:00,848
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

1464
01:49:01,732 --> 01:49:05,691
I tried to seize the moon
while staying on the earth.

1465
01:49:05,932 --> 01:49:09,845
Don't worry, Hamida.
You will get your moon.

1466
01:49:11,052 --> 01:49:12,167
Come here.

1467
01:49:12,812 --> 01:49:17,363
Champa. You are here?
Where were you till now?

1468
01:49:18,092 --> 01:49:20,970
Look, call Khizar
Khan and tell him..

1469
01:49:21,252 --> 01:49:23,368
To held a
celebration in the entire city.

1470
01:49:23,732 --> 01:49:27,691
Give an order to dance, sing
and rejoice at the palace. Go.

1471
01:49:28,132 --> 01:49:29,804
Your Majesty!

1472
01:49:32,732 --> 01:49:35,121
Your Majesty, the Moghul
army commander Adham Khan..

1473
01:49:35,212 --> 01:49:36,725
Has attacked Malwa.

1474
01:49:36,812 --> 01:49:37,927
He has attacked?

1475
01:49:38,012 --> 01:49:39,889
Yes. And we have got the
news that the armies..

1476
01:49:39,972 --> 01:49:41,690
Will reach the
Mandav border very soon.

1477
01:49:41,772 --> 01:49:45,367
A deception. So Tansen's
arrival was a plot too.

1478
01:49:46,012 --> 01:49:48,685
The Moghuls attacked without
giving us a chance to prepare.

1479
01:49:49,612 --> 01:49:51,812
But Hafiz Khan would have
fought with them at Sarangpur.

1480
01:49:51,852 --> 01:49:53,649
Hafiz Khan has
cheated us, Your Majesty.

1481
01:49:53,732 --> 01:49:55,852
Our armies at Sarangpur
have united with the Moghuls..

1482
01:49:55,972 --> 01:49:58,486
And they are preparing
to march towards Mandav.

1483
01:49:59,212 --> 01:50:00,850
Betrayer!

1484
01:50:03,052 --> 01:50:05,188
The Moghuls and Pathans who
were separated since years..

1485
01:50:05,212 --> 01:50:06,565
Have united today.

1486
01:50:06,852 --> 01:50:10,049
Now our armies will
attack Mandav together.

1487
01:50:10,292 --> 01:50:12,487
The victory will be ours.

1488
01:50:12,692 --> 01:50:17,766
You will seize the
throne of Malwa and Roopmati?

1489
01:50:17,852 --> 01:50:19,001
She will belong to you.

1490
01:50:21,292 --> 01:50:24,125
Okay. So order the
armies to march ahead.

1491
01:50:24,332 --> 01:50:27,483
We should overtake
Mandav before sunset.

1492
01:50:27,692 --> 01:50:31,321
Be assured. All the preparations
for the attack are done.

1493
01:50:31,772 --> 01:50:34,730
And yes, I forgot to
tell you one thing.

1494
01:50:34,972 --> 01:50:37,805
Your Tansen is
imprisoned in this fort.

1495
01:50:37,972 --> 01:50:39,928
Please come and meet him once.

1496
01:50:40,012 --> 01:50:43,925
Shut up! I don't even want to
hear that unlucky man's name.

1497
01:50:44,412 --> 01:50:49,327
Tansen! The great musician.
To hell with him.

1498
01:51:03,132 --> 01:51:05,885
But the war is held
between the Moghuls and Pathans.

1499
01:51:05,972 --> 01:51:07,121
Why should we get involved?

1500
01:51:07,212 --> 01:51:09,442
You don't get such an
opportunity often, Thakur.

1501
01:51:09,532 --> 01:51:12,205
It is not the question of your
Chammapuri or my Maheshwar..

1502
01:51:12,292 --> 01:51:14,123
It is the question
of Malwa's respect.

1503
01:51:14,212 --> 01:51:16,407
Malwa's respect is
our respect, Father.

1504
01:51:16,612 --> 01:51:18,603
We will protect it even
by sacrificing our lives.

1505
01:51:18,692 --> 01:51:24,164
Well said. My old body is also
pepped up on seeing your courage.

1506
01:51:24,332 --> 01:51:27,563
- Say the king of Malwa Baaz Bahadur..
- Live long.

1507
01:51:27,852 --> 01:51:29,888
- Queen Roopmati.
- Live long.

1508
01:51:30,292 --> 01:51:32,203
I'm a Kshatriya girl, Your Majesty.

1509
01:51:32,732 --> 01:51:34,529
I've not learned to
hide in the palace..

1510
01:51:34,692 --> 01:51:37,331
When the country is on fire.

1511
01:51:37,852 --> 01:51:41,242
I'll fight the war along
with you to protect Malwa.

1512
01:51:41,332 --> 01:51:44,051
No, Roopmati. It is not your work.

1513
01:51:44,772 --> 01:51:47,068
There is a great difference
between music and the battlefield.

1514
01:51:47,092 --> 01:51:50,641
Don't forget that the Kshatriya
girls who perform their talent..

1515
01:51:50,892 --> 01:51:53,008
Can also sing the
songs of war if required.

1516
01:51:53,852 --> 01:51:57,891
Take me along. Give me a
chance to sacrifice my life..

1517
01:51:57,972 --> 01:51:59,291
While protecting my country.

1518
01:51:59,372 --> 01:52:03,923
Well said, Roop. Now I can't
mar your enthusiasm. Come on.

1519
01:52:04,852 --> 01:52:07,844
Emperor Baaz Bahadur
live long. Hail Malwa.

1520
01:52:19,252 --> 01:52:23,404
"If you wish to write the history."

1521
01:52:23,812 --> 01:52:28,932
"If you wish to write the
history with the theme of freedom."

1522
01:52:30,692 --> 01:52:35,208
"If you wish to write the
history with the theme of freedom."

1523
01:52:35,292 --> 01:52:40,002
"Heroes, protect your
motherland with your blood."

1524
01:52:40,092 --> 01:52:42,287
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1525
01:52:42,372 --> 01:52:44,602
"Allah is the greatest!"

1526
01:52:44,692 --> 01:52:46,842
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1527
01:52:46,932 --> 01:52:49,048
"Allah is the greatest!"

1528
01:52:51,372 --> 01:52:53,602
"Stop fighting among ourselves."

1529
01:52:53,692 --> 01:52:55,887
"Wade away the differences."

1530
01:52:55,972 --> 01:52:58,122
"Stop fighting among ourselves."

1531
01:52:58,212 --> 01:53:00,442
"Wade away the differences."

1532
01:53:00,532 --> 01:53:04,969
"Unite the strings of hearts
when our country is in danger."

1533
01:53:05,052 --> 01:53:07,202
"Unite the strings of hearts."

1534
01:53:07,292 --> 01:53:11,683
"If anyone wants to
bond us with a cruel law."

1535
01:53:11,772 --> 01:53:13,728
"A cruel law."

1536
01:53:13,812 --> 01:53:18,567
"Heroes, protect your
motherland with your blood."

1537
01:53:18,652 --> 01:53:20,688
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1538
01:53:20,812 --> 01:53:23,007
"Allah is the greatest!"

1539
01:53:23,092 --> 01:53:25,162
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1540
01:53:25,252 --> 01:53:27,607
"Allah is the greatest!"

1541
01:53:31,932 --> 01:53:36,448
"Don't consider us weak, we
are the brave women of India."

1542
01:53:36,532 --> 01:53:38,727
"We are the brave women of India."

1543
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:42,885
"We are not delicate flowers,
we are fire and spark."

1544
01:53:42,972 --> 01:53:45,645
"We are fire and spark."

1545
01:53:47,012 --> 01:53:49,242
"Discard the chiming anklets."

1546
01:53:49,332 --> 01:53:51,448
"Hold the sword in your hand."

1547
01:53:51,532 --> 01:53:53,762
"Move your veil aside."

1548
01:53:53,852 --> 01:53:57,288
"Become the form of
Goddess Ranchandi."

1549
01:53:57,372 --> 01:54:01,490
"Hail Ambe. Jagdambe."

1550
01:54:01,772 --> 01:54:03,967
"Hail Ambe. Jagdambe."

1551
01:54:04,052 --> 01:54:06,805
"Hail Ambe. Jagdambe."

1552
01:54:09,012 --> 01:54:13,483
"If you wish our country
to always smile in peace."

1553
01:54:13,572 --> 01:54:15,449
"Smile in peace."

1554
01:54:15,532 --> 01:54:20,287
"Heroes, protect your
motherland with your blood."

1555
01:54:20,372 --> 01:54:22,442
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1556
01:54:22,612 --> 01:54:24,728
"Allah is the greatest!"

1557
01:54:24,932 --> 01:54:27,048
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1558
01:54:27,172 --> 01:54:29,481
"Allah is the greatest!"

1559
01:54:31,452 --> 01:54:36,003
"If you wish to write the
history with the theme of freedom."

1560
01:54:36,092 --> 01:54:40,608
"Heroes, protect your
motherland with your blood."

1561
01:54:40,812 --> 01:54:42,803
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1562
01:54:42,892 --> 01:54:44,803
"Allah is the greatest!"

1563
01:54:44,892 --> 01:54:46,723
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1564
01:54:46,812 --> 01:54:48,609
"Allah is the greatest!"

1565
01:54:48,692 --> 01:54:50,523
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1566
01:54:50,612 --> 01:54:52,284
"Allah is the greatest!"

1567
01:54:52,372 --> 01:54:54,169
"Hail Lord Shiva."

1568
01:54:54,252 --> 01:54:56,208
"Allah is the greatest!"

1569
01:55:17,572 --> 01:55:19,005
March ahead!

1570
01:56:00,732 --> 01:56:03,804
Kill them! Destroy them.

1571
01:56:23,052 --> 01:56:25,043
Stop, dear. Stop.

1572
01:56:25,892 --> 01:56:29,043
What will Roopmati say?
What will the people say?

1573
01:56:29,772 --> 01:56:30,841
Please stop.

1574
01:57:30,452 --> 01:57:35,845
Don't you dare! You don't
to kill but just arrest her.

1575
01:57:44,972 --> 01:57:49,011
Baaz Bahadur ran away from the
battlefield after being wounded.

1576
01:57:49,572 --> 01:57:52,166
But my soldiers are following him.

1577
01:57:52,652 --> 01:57:56,122
He will have to return
to Mandav dead or alive.

1578
01:57:58,372 --> 01:58:06,211
And you? I hand you over to
the King of Malwa, Hafiz Khan.

1579
01:58:10,452 --> 01:58:13,762
Soldiers, take
Roopmati to my palace.

1580
01:58:14,412 --> 01:58:17,722
I will marry her tomorrow.

1581
01:58:22,292 --> 01:58:30,292
Look, tell Roopmati to
spend three days anyhow.

1582
01:58:32,052 --> 01:58:33,929
Only three days.

1583
01:58:35,492 --> 01:58:42,011
As soon the armies of Burhanpura,
Asirgha and Khandesh arrive..

1584
01:58:43,692 --> 01:58:45,922
I will attack the Mandav fort.

1585
01:58:47,052 --> 01:58:51,603
Mandav will belong to
us again. Once again.

1586
01:58:57,012 --> 01:59:01,244
Listen.. tell her..

1587
01:59:02,652 --> 01:59:07,089
That I'll reach Mandav
before sunset on the third day.

1588
01:59:09,092 --> 01:59:13,529
If I'm unable to reach, then think..

1589
01:59:16,652 --> 01:59:19,405
Think that Baaz is no more.

1590
01:59:19,492 --> 01:59:21,130
Don't say this, Your Majesty.

1591
01:59:21,772 --> 01:59:24,923
Your Majesty, Mandav
will belong to you again..

1592
01:59:25,252 --> 01:59:27,288
On the third day from today.

1593
01:59:29,852 --> 01:59:31,604
It will happen so.

1594
01:59:33,972 --> 01:59:36,532
Hurry up, Hamida. I've to
cross the river before sunrise..

1595
01:59:36,612 --> 01:59:37,806
And reach the emperor.

1596
01:59:37,892 --> 01:59:40,122
Don't risk your life, Queen.

1597
01:59:40,932 --> 01:59:44,720
Silly girl. You are so
impatient to meet him?

1598
01:59:45,772 --> 01:59:48,366
Keep patience. We will go together.

1599
01:59:49,252 --> 01:59:52,005
It will take two days to
meet Baaz and gather the armies.

1600
01:59:53,412 --> 01:59:56,165
Then Mandav will belong to us again.

1601
01:59:58,132 --> 02:00:02,284
And you.. you will
become the queen of Mandav..

1602
02:00:03,332 --> 02:00:05,129
Baaz Bahadur's wife..

1603
02:00:14,692 --> 02:00:16,205
Perhaps someone is coming.

1604
02:00:16,652 --> 02:00:18,324
You wait here, I'll go and check.

1605
02:00:18,412 --> 02:00:22,405
No, Queen. You take the
horses down quickly, I'll check.

1606
02:00:22,572 --> 02:00:24,403
Listen.. be alert.

1607
02:00:52,932 --> 02:00:54,923
Who is it? Hamida?

1608
02:00:55,492 --> 02:00:59,201
I was searching you, dear.
It's better I found you.

1609
02:00:59,452 --> 02:01:01,283
I had heard that you were in Mandav.

1610
02:01:01,372 --> 02:01:03,840
I searched the entire fort
but I didn't see you anywhere.

1611
02:01:04,172 --> 02:01:07,323
Well, I'll become the
king of Malwa from tomorrow.

1612
02:01:07,652 --> 02:01:09,370
All my desires are fulfilled.

1613
02:01:09,572 --> 02:01:12,006
- Now your desires will be fulfilled too.
- Father!

1614
02:01:12,092 --> 02:01:14,652
Yes. Tomorrow the
Moghul army commander..

1615
02:01:14,732 --> 02:01:17,769
Adham Khan will marry Roopmati.

1616
02:01:17,972 --> 02:01:21,931
If you wish, you can
get married to him too.

1617
02:01:22,132 --> 02:01:25,204
Stop it, Father. It's enough.

1618
02:01:36,812 --> 02:01:38,609
Roopmati wants to escape.

1619
02:01:38,812 --> 02:01:42,566
Perhaps she doesn't know that
I've captured the Mandav fort.

1620
02:01:43,252 --> 02:01:45,402
Hamida, get out of my way.

1621
02:01:45,572 --> 02:01:47,688
You can't go there in my presence.

1622
02:01:50,172 --> 02:01:53,130
Foolish girl, you want to
die with your father's hands?

1623
02:01:53,292 --> 02:01:55,487
The father and daughter
relation has broken that day..

1624
02:01:55,692 --> 02:01:59,207
When you deceived me
and betrayed our country.

1625
02:02:16,892 --> 02:02:18,450
Why hasn't Hamida turned up yet?

1626
02:03:32,252 --> 02:03:34,846
Queen! Queen!

1627
02:03:35,532 --> 02:03:38,046
Hamida, let's go. Come on.

1628
02:03:38,452 --> 02:03:40,522
Hey? What's this?

1629
02:03:41,332 --> 02:03:44,881
You may go, Queen. Goodbye.

1630
02:03:45,172 --> 02:03:49,688
- Hamida!
- Queen of Malwa, live long.

1631
02:03:50,092 --> 02:03:53,289
Hamida! Hamida!

1632
02:04:19,092 --> 02:04:22,084
- Who is this?
- What do we see? It is Hafiz Khan.

1633
02:04:22,172 --> 02:04:25,608
- Hafiz Khan is murdered!
- Hafiz Khan is killed!

1634
02:04:35,212 --> 02:04:41,287
- Look, Roopmati is escaping.
- She is fleeing.

1635
02:04:41,732 --> 02:04:43,927
- Roopmati.
- Arrest her.

1636
02:04:44,012 --> 02:04:46,162
Don't let her escape. Follow her.

1637
02:04:46,252 --> 02:04:48,686
Listen! Don't injure her.

1638
02:06:10,492 --> 02:06:12,847
- Baaz!
- There is Roopmati. - Arrest her.

1639
02:06:13,372 --> 02:06:14,885
Save me, Baaz!

1640
02:06:24,492 --> 02:06:27,529
Oh, Almighty, where are you?

1641
02:06:32,012 --> 02:06:34,845
Oh, Lord, where has this
troublemaker arrived from?

1642
02:06:34,932 --> 02:06:37,287
Don't you recognise
the gardener's daughter?

1643
02:06:38,172 --> 02:06:40,766
Who doesn't know the
gardener's daughter?

1644
02:06:42,012 --> 02:06:43,365
But how did you reach here?

1645
02:06:43,452 --> 02:06:47,604
Oh, why are you asking?
Whatnot I had to do to reach here.

1646
02:06:47,692 --> 02:06:51,048
I pleased and displeased
many and reached till here.

1647
02:06:52,412 --> 02:06:56,007
Then what are you doing here? Go in.

1648
02:06:56,892 --> 02:06:58,883
- Wait!
- Stop.

1649
02:06:58,972 --> 02:07:01,805
- Who is she?
- Sir, she is the gardener's daughter.

1650
02:07:02,212 --> 02:07:03,988
She has brought flowers. I
know her since childhood.

1651
02:07:04,012 --> 02:07:05,889
She was so young, now
she has grown so big.

1652
02:07:05,972 --> 02:07:07,485
- I see.
- Yes.

1653
02:07:07,932 --> 02:07:10,002
- What does it contain?
- Flowers, sir.

1654
02:07:10,212 --> 02:07:13,284
She makes flower-braid,
garlands, sir. She is a good girl.

1655
02:07:13,852 --> 02:07:15,968
- Okay, you may go.
- You may go.

1656
02:07:16,052 --> 02:07:17,610
Go..

1657
02:07:18,852 --> 02:07:20,126
King..

1658
02:07:20,452 --> 02:07:26,049
- Queen! Queen!
- Who is it? Who are you?

1659
02:07:27,052 --> 02:07:28,246
What do you want?

1660
02:07:28,652 --> 02:07:30,722
I'm the gardener,
Queen. I've brought flowers.

1661
02:07:31,172 --> 02:07:33,845
- Who has sent you here?
- Don't be angry, Queen.

1662
02:07:36,452 --> 02:07:39,046
Emperor Baaz
Bahadur has sent me here.

1663
02:07:39,692 --> 02:07:41,045
Baaz Bahadur?

1664
02:07:50,932 --> 02:07:55,244
'Roop, I'll reach to Mandav
with the armies in three days.'

1665
02:07:55,692 --> 02:07:58,365
'If I can't reach before
sunset on the third day..'

1666
02:07:58,852 --> 02:08:00,604
'..I will never show
you my face again.'

1667
02:08:01,052 --> 02:08:04,328
'Think that Baaz has died.'

1668
02:08:05,412 --> 02:08:06,606
Baaz?

1669
02:08:06,692 --> 02:08:08,091
Roopmati.

1670
02:08:15,212 --> 02:08:19,125
You don't know Adham Khan well yet.

1671
02:08:19,692 --> 02:08:26,211
Well, you must have come to
know that it is not so easy..

1672
02:08:26,572 --> 02:08:28,563
To escape from my clutches.

1673
02:08:28,972 --> 02:08:32,647
I don't like this misbehaviour,
Roop. Listen carefully.

1674
02:08:32,852 --> 02:08:36,561
Either be ready to marry me or die.

1675
02:08:38,012 --> 02:08:42,688
Oh, God, I want to meet Baaz.

1676
02:08:44,132 --> 02:08:47,602
Do you hear me?
What have you decided?

1677
02:08:48,012 --> 02:08:49,365
Marriage or death?

1678
02:08:49,692 --> 02:08:54,322
No, no. I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1679
02:08:55,452 --> 02:08:58,410
I knew it. Who doesn't
love her life after all?

1680
02:08:58,572 --> 02:09:00,767
Okay, so our
wedding is fixed tonight.

1681
02:09:01,812 --> 02:09:03,689
- Is anyone here?
- No, no.

1682
02:09:04,292 --> 02:09:08,922
Please have mercy on me.
Give me three days time.

1683
02:09:09,212 --> 02:09:10,964
But why three days?

1684
02:09:11,692 --> 02:09:14,081
I want to overcome
the grief of death..

1685
02:09:14,172 --> 02:09:16,163
Of my father and
both the brothers.

1686
02:09:17,012 --> 02:09:24,407
- Only three days.
- I see. All right. Never mind.

1687
02:09:24,892 --> 02:09:28,601
But remember, you will
be mind after three days.

1688
02:09:29,052 --> 02:09:32,124
You will have to
become mine. Understood?

1689
02:10:05,172 --> 02:10:07,891
Your Majesty, the crowned musician..

1690
02:10:07,972 --> 02:10:10,964
Rank holder of nine gems,
king of music, Tansen..

1691
02:10:11,052 --> 02:10:12,772
Seeks your
permission to present himself.

1692
02:10:13,372 --> 02:10:14,964
King of music?

1693
02:10:20,612 --> 02:10:22,045
What's wrong, Tansen?

1694
02:10:22,652 --> 02:10:24,802
You were captured by Baaz Bahadur..

1695
02:10:25,092 --> 02:10:26,445
Then how did you reach here?

1696
02:10:27,012 --> 02:10:28,843
Has Adham Khan got
victory over Mandav?

1697
02:10:29,092 --> 02:10:30,764
It is terrible, Your Majesty.

1698
02:10:31,332 --> 02:10:34,608
- Hafiz Khan has succeeded in cheating you.
- Fraudulence?

1699
02:10:34,692 --> 02:10:37,525
Yes, Your Majesty. I was not
imprisoned by Baaz Bahadur..

1700
02:10:37,612 --> 02:10:39,045
But Hafiz Khan.

1701
02:10:39,132 --> 02:10:42,283
Hurry up, Your Majesty,
otherwise Mandav will be ruined.

1702
02:10:42,452 --> 02:10:44,647
Adham Khan has shed
the blood of men, women..

1703
02:10:44,732 --> 02:10:46,563
And children in
the lanes of Mandav.

1704
02:10:46,732 --> 02:10:49,963
He has killed Baaz Bahadur and
he is going to marry Roopmati.

1705
02:10:50,132 --> 02:10:54,011
No, great musician. Adham
Khan is my cousin brother.

1706
02:10:55,092 --> 02:10:56,491
He can never disobey me.

1707
02:10:56,572 --> 02:10:58,688
There is no time,
Your Majesty. Hurry up.

1708
02:10:58,772 --> 02:11:01,366
You will see the truth
as soon you reach Mandav.

1709
02:11:01,452 --> 02:11:06,207
If he has disobeyed me, I
will definitely punish him.

1710
02:11:06,292 --> 02:11:07,441
Come with me.

1711
02:11:20,692 --> 02:11:25,129
"Save me from humiliation,
Your Majesty..

1712
02:11:25,212 --> 02:11:29,569
That's all I ask today."

1713
02:11:29,772 --> 02:11:34,084
"Save me from humiliation,
Your Majesty..

1714
02:11:34,252 --> 02:11:38,530
That's all I ask today."

1715
02:11:38,772 --> 02:11:43,084
"Save me from humiliation,
Your Majesty..

1716
02:11:43,692 --> 02:11:47,367
No one has come to
fight against the Moghuls..

1717
02:11:48,052 --> 02:11:51,328
For the sake of Malwa's freedom.

1718
02:11:53,572 --> 02:11:55,802
But I can't wait anymore,
Sardar Khan.

1719
02:11:56,052 --> 02:11:58,202
I will go. I will go alone.

1720
02:11:58,292 --> 02:12:01,045
No, Your Majesty. You can't go
anywhere in such a condition.

1721
02:12:01,132 --> 02:12:04,283
You don't understand,
Sardar Khan. I will have to go.

1722
02:12:04,532 --> 02:12:09,128
I will have to go. I've very
less time. I've very less time.

1723
02:12:13,612 --> 02:12:15,967
No, Your Majesty. It
is your stubbornness.

1724
02:12:16,292 --> 02:12:19,329
You are unable to stand, then
how will you reach till Mandav?

1725
02:12:19,532 --> 02:12:21,568
I had promised, Sardar Khan.

1726
02:12:22,412 --> 02:12:24,562
Three days will be completed today.

1727
02:12:25,372 --> 02:12:28,762
I will have to reach
Mandav before sunset.

1728
02:12:29,492 --> 02:12:31,801
Roopmati is waiting for me.

1729
02:12:48,332 --> 02:12:52,166
The sun has set,
Roopmati. Three days have passed.

1730
02:12:54,812 --> 02:13:00,921
You know, Roop, tonight is the
most beautiful night of your life.

1731
02:13:02,212 --> 02:13:05,124
You will become the queen
of someone's heart today.

1732
02:13:05,692 --> 02:13:07,603
You will make someone yours.

1733
02:13:10,692 --> 02:13:12,569
What are you all doing here?

1734
02:13:12,652 --> 02:13:14,722
Go and make
preparation for the wedding.

1735
02:13:14,812 --> 02:13:16,928
Decorate the palace. Play the music.

1736
02:13:17,772 --> 02:13:19,125
Goodbye, Roop.

1737
02:13:20,532 --> 02:13:24,730
Oh, yes. I forgot to
tell you something.

1738
02:13:25,692 --> 02:13:28,684
Baaz Bahadur has died.

1739
02:13:33,492 --> 02:13:34,607
What?

1740
02:13:39,412 --> 02:13:40,481
Baaz?

1741
02:14:05,372 --> 02:14:10,048
"When the bride will
come with kohl-laden eyes."

1742
02:14:12,132 --> 02:14:16,364
"When the bride will
come with kohl-laden eyes."

1743
02:14:16,532 --> 02:14:20,810
"The music of love will
play in the groom's heart."

1744
02:14:20,972 --> 02:14:25,648
"The music of love will
play in the groom's heart."

1745
02:14:40,252 --> 02:14:45,565
"Return."

1746
02:14:46,332 --> 02:14:51,247
"Return."

1747
02:14:52,252 --> 02:14:56,723
"Return."

1748
02:14:57,972 --> 02:15:03,808
"Return, beloved."

1749
02:15:05,772 --> 02:15:13,772
"Return beloved, my
songs are calling you."

1750
02:15:15,612 --> 02:15:23,612
"Return beloved, my
songs are calling you."

1751
02:15:25,572 --> 02:15:30,407
"My music is forlorn."

1752
02:15:30,492 --> 02:15:34,451
"My music is forlorn."

1753
02:15:34,652 --> 02:15:39,203
"My songs are calling you."

1754
02:15:40,172 --> 02:15:45,530
"Return beloved."

1755
02:16:22,772 --> 02:16:27,050
"The rain is pouring,
my eyes are weeping.."

1756
02:16:27,132 --> 02:16:32,160
"My heart is desperate,
please come now."

1757
02:16:32,531 --> 02:16:36,649
"The rain is pouring,
my eyes are weeping.."

1758
02:16:36,852 --> 02:16:41,528
"My heart is desperate,
please come now."

1759
02:16:42,172 --> 02:16:46,165
"The cold breeze is
arousing my heart."

1760
02:16:46,332 --> 02:16:51,122
"O' beloved, show me your face now."

1761
02:16:51,451 --> 02:16:56,286
"What a promise of
love you have fulfilled!"

1762
02:16:58,812 --> 02:17:02,361
"What a promise of
love you have fulfilled!"

1763
02:17:02,611 --> 02:17:07,480
"My songs are calling you."

1764
02:17:08,132 --> 02:17:12,967
"Return back beloved."

1765
02:17:25,371 --> 02:17:30,161
"You smile at one moment
and cry at the other.."

1766
02:17:30,252 --> 02:17:34,530
"Such is the game of life."

1767
02:17:34,892 --> 02:17:39,727
"You smile at one moment
and cry at the other.."

1768
02:17:39,812 --> 02:17:43,851
"Such is the game of life."

1769
02:17:44,572 --> 02:17:49,327
"Meet at one moment and
separate at the other.."

1770
02:17:49,412 --> 02:17:53,200
"This world is a
short-lived carnival."

1771
02:17:53,652 --> 02:17:58,646
"This moment shouldn't pass away."

1772
02:18:00,892 --> 02:18:04,487
"This moment shouldn't pass away."

1773
02:18:04,691 --> 02:18:09,446
"My songs are calling you."

1774
02:18:10,132 --> 02:18:18,132
"Return back beloved, my
songs are calling you."

1775
02:18:19,371 --> 02:18:24,047
"My music is forlorn."

1776
02:18:24,132 --> 02:18:27,807
"My music is forlorn."

1777
02:18:27,892 --> 02:18:32,568
"My songs are calling you."

1778
02:18:33,371 --> 02:18:38,604
"Return beloved."

1779
02:19:26,652 --> 02:19:33,364
Oh! The bedecked bride
is waiting for her groom.

1780
02:19:38,652 --> 02:19:43,168
A veil like cloud on
the beautiful face.

1781
02:19:44,412 --> 02:19:50,203
The eyelids lowered out
of shyness, smiling lips.

1782
02:19:51,212 --> 02:19:57,208
Oh, my, my! She possesses
all the weapons to kill me.

1783
02:20:14,172 --> 02:20:17,608
Roop, raise your eyes.

1784
02:20:18,412 --> 02:20:23,088
Look, your lover is
ready to die before you.

1785
02:20:23,652 --> 02:20:26,485
I see. You are blushing.

1786
02:20:27,252 --> 02:20:32,849
Darling, it's not
good to blush so much.

1787
02:20:37,772 --> 02:20:40,240
Roopmati, what's this?

1788
02:20:47,732 --> 02:20:49,245
Don't you dare, Adham Khan!

1789
02:21:03,212 --> 02:21:05,726
Roop! Roop!

1790
02:21:06,812 --> 02:21:10,566
Roop? She has already
reached to heaven before you.

1791
02:21:10,652 --> 02:21:11,880
Roop!

1792
02:21:15,732 --> 02:21:19,611
Adham Khan, did I send
you to Mandav for this?

1793
02:21:20,332 --> 02:21:23,404
I had ordered you to bring
Roopmati and Baaz Bahadur to Delhi.

1794
02:21:23,772 --> 02:21:27,162
But you killed these two
artists with your dirty hands.

1795
02:21:27,532 --> 02:21:29,045
I didn't do anything, Your Majesty.

1796
02:21:29,132 --> 02:21:31,566
Roopmati consumed poison
and committed suicide.

1797
02:21:31,652 --> 02:21:33,768
Shut up, disobedient man!

1798
02:21:34,412 --> 02:21:37,085
I know why Roopmati consumed
poison and committed suicide.

1799
02:21:37,532 --> 02:21:39,682
Soldiers, arrest him!

1800
02:21:56,252 --> 02:21:59,562
Roop. Baaz.

1801
02:22:01,452 --> 02:22:04,330
I regret that
because of my mistake..

1802
02:22:04,412 --> 02:22:08,724
Two talented artists
of Hindustan have died.

1803
02:22:10,132 --> 02:22:14,842
Late artists, Akbar is your culprit.

1804
02:22:16,772 --> 02:22:18,967
It possible then forgive me.

1805
02:22:19,532 --> 02:22:24,208
"Meet at one moment and
separate at the other.."

1806
02:22:24,372 --> 02:22:28,047
"This world is a
short-lived carnival."

1807
02:22:28,372 --> 02:22:32,251
"This moment shouldn't pass away."

1808
02:22:32,452 --> 02:22:36,843
"My songs are calling you."

1809
02:22:37,852 --> 02:22:42,767
"Return, beloved."
