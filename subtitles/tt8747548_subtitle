1
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,708
Oh, damn!

2
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,166
{\an8}They're with me.

3
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,541
- Anything else?
- <i>Axone.</i>

4
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,416
Call her again.

5
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,125
- Yeah, Minam.
<i>- Yes?</i>

6
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,416
Why did you leave so early?

7
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,000
<i>I had to go to church.</i>

8
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,000
Are you okay?

9
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,208
Just focus on the interview, okay?

10
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,291
Yes.

11
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:26,125
Minam, we'll handle
everything for the evening.

12
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,958
Rock the interview, Minam!

13
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,208
Hurry up!

14
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,000
<i>Lift your feet & dance away.</i>

15
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,416
<i>Sing a melody, make the heart sway.</i>

16
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:58,083
<i>Joy & woe are woven fine.</i>

17
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,333
<i>So, go ahead & spread some smiles.</i>

18
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,500
<i>Those lovely days & nights</i>

19
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,083
<i>I remember those...</i>

20
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,333
<i>Those...</i>

21
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:20,416
<i>Those... lovely days & nights.</i>

22
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,291
"I remember those."

23
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,416
<i>I remember those meetings.</i>

24
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,291
<i>Those lovely days & nights...</i>

25
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,500
Hey! Stop, stop! Stop!
Who is that?

26
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,208
Granny, he's my cousin.

27
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,666
Cousin or convict, I don't care.

28
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,541
No boys are allowed
after six in the evening.

29
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,250
Yes, but he's just arrived, Granny.

30
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:58,458
This rooster sneaks out in the morning

31
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:02,375
before anyone can wake up,
and you say he's your cousin?

32
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,750
The bugger can't even
keep his eyes open!

33
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,541
Granny, I swear he's my cousin.

34
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,083
Yes, Granny. I'm her cousin.

35
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:14,208
Oh, my! Now, who is this?

36
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,666
Good morning, Granny.

37
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,791
Oh, God! Why do you guys lie so much?

38
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,875
Now, listen to me carefully!

39
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:29,333
I don't want to see any
boys in this house from today!

40
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,291
Hey! Where are you running off?

41
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,333
Stand right there, and listen to me!

42
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,500
You mongrels!

43
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,125
Hurry up, Ma.

44
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,416
Let's go!

45
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh, God!
Tell me, why did you wake up late?

46
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:48,583
You wake up late,
and then, you make me hurry.

47
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,166
You'll fall down. Be careful.

48
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,791
We are going to be late.

49
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,750
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Everyone has left.

50
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,541
<i>- Go, check with the other girl, please!</i>
- Okay.

51
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,625
Okay.

52
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,333
Give me this.

53
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,434
- Tomatoes?
- Yes, one kilo.

54
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,458
It's Rs. 35 a kilo.

55
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,021
- Pick out the good ones.
- Yes, sure.

56
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,875
One kilo? Don't worry.
I'll give you the good ones.

57
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,951
- You want the big ones?
- No.

58
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No? Okay.

59
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,458
Give me one kilo tomatoes.

60
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,958
- Have your tea.
- Look at that hot chick!

61
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,458
Add two more.

62
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,000
These girls have a tight booty!

63
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,750
I can do her all night.

64
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,583
- Do you have the stamina?
- You know, their moans are so sexy!

65
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,541
What did you just say?

66
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,875
What happened?

67
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,708
- You just said something. What was it?
- What happened?

68
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,083
- What did you just say?
- I didn't say anything.

69
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,125
- You did.
- No, I didn't.

70
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,208
No, you just...

71
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,750
- What were you saying?
- Nothing. I was sitting quietly.

72
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,416
What happened, dear?

73
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,375
Uncle, this guy was
being vulgar with me.

74
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,541
Hey! We didn't say a word.

75
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,875
- What do you exactly mean by vulgar?
- He said something dirty.

76
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,250
She's just making up stories.
It's nothing

77
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,250
I am not making up stories.
Ask him! He was right here.

78
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,666
- I didn't hear anything.
- Why are you lying?

79
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,833
Ma'am, you're obstructing my business.

80
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,250
Men say whatever they want.
Just ignore them.

81
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,000
He's saying he didn't hear anything.

82
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,125
Then, ask him. He was right beside me.

83
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,833
- She's crazy. Look, what...
- Hey, don't call me crazy!

84
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,708
- Hey!
- How can you hit a girl?

85
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,458
- Hey, back off!
- She pushed me first!

86
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,750
Or I would never touch a girl!

87
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,666
- You boys seem to be from a good family.
- She pushed us first!

88
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,375
- She pushed us first!
- Didn't you see that?

89
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,291
- These people deserve it!
- Just leave, please!

90
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,000
She pushed us! Let's go, let's go.

91
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,875
- Are you okay, dear?
- You should just ignore such people.

92
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,708
Just take her home, dear.

93
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,125
He was standing right there.

94
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,541
Listen!

95
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,333
Bendang has left.

96
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,875
Kapil's here. Just come!

97
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,750
Don't be scared!
I've taken her permission.

98
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,583
We'll play a couple of rounds.

99
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,708
Yes, come fast!

100
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,666
What are they doing here?

101
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,125
They always play outside,
but today, they change their mind.

102
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,958
Oh, God! I wonder why.

103
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,583
Zorem knows Hyper, right?

104
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,750
- Yes.
- Tell him to talk to Hyper.

105
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,166
But we've already taken
so much help from him.

106
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,583
I mean

107
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,541
you know... Zorem doesn't like Minam.

108
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,791
Hey, isn't he the landlord's son?

109
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,958
What's his real name?

110
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,250
You said you knew him!

111
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,708
Besides, we just moved.

112
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,208
Do you know the landlord's name?

113
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,750
We call him "Uncle."

114
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,625
- I hope you've got some money.
- Oh, no!

115
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,250
Come on! Give us your share.

116
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,125
Go away. I don't want to buy anything.

117
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:37,000
I've not come as a salesman.
I'm your son's friend.

118
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,750
I can't hear a word. Come in.

119
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,416
- Which son?
- Where's my share?

120
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,791
The one who's always hyper.

121
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:46,791
Take this.

122
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,333
I forgot his name.

123
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,875
What? You forgot his name? How strange!

124
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,125
What a friend you are!
You don't even know his name?

125
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:57,041
What's going on?
I've never seen you here before!

126
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,916
Hey! How come you're here?

127
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,208
Hey! Who is he?

128
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,791
He's a friend.

129
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,083
- Is he?
- Yes.

130
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,416
He doesn't even know your name.

131
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,333
Dad, look where he's from!
These guys can't speak Hindi!

132
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,416
But why doesn't he know your name?

133
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,166
He knows my name is Shiv!

134
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,416
Look at him! He's given away his name.

135
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,916
Uncle, he's my friend. He knows my name.

136
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,625
In that case, tell me. What is his name?

137
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,708
Come on, Dad!
Are you playing poker or detective?

138
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,958
- Forget all that. Tell us his name!
- Yes, tell us.

139
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,208
What's his name?

140
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,375
His name is Danny.

141
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,541
What is your name?

142
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,166
- Of course, he'll say Danny now!
- Oh, no!

143
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,541
Do you think I am an idiot?

144
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,416
- Stop trying to be Sherlock! Let's go!
- Keep your plate in the kitchen!

145
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,833
Spoiled brat!

146
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,226
- Where were you?
- Hey, come here!

147
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,125
How can you have a wedding here?

148
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,833
There's no place for dancing,

149
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,625
or a cocktail bar.

150
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,916
Come on! It's just us.

151
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,958
How's that a wedding then?

152
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,416
Shiv, we need to cook

153
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,000
while your granny takes
a nap and before

154
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,083
the Bengali auntie gets back.

155
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,771
We need to get done with our cooking.

156
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,033
There's hardly any time, then!

157
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,375
- What do we do?
- Shiv, can you help us?

158
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,291
On one condition.

159
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,708
What is it?

160
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,291
You guys must get me
a Northeastern girlfriend!

161
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,458
Sonu will be so jealous!

162
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,583
What happened?

163
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,541
I spoke to Puia and Jenjum.

164
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,041
They also don't know where Bendang is.

165
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:53,000
His phone... is not reachable.

166
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,208
Let's go to Bendang's house.

167
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is from me.

168
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,541
And this is from me.

169
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,625
- What's going on here? Tell me!
- Keep playing!

170
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,875
You've turned my daughter's
house into a casino!

171
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,208
- Mom, I had told you.
- What are you talking about?

172
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,750
Now, you're backing out. I had told
you we were coming to play cards.

173
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,000
- Yes.
- You had agreed to it.

174
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,041
- Then, why are you making a scene?
- I had said only half an hour,

175
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,708
- but you've been playing for hours!
- This is the last round.

176
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,791
My poor daughter toils away at work,

177
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,333
while you sit here swatting flies all day

178
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,041
with this bunch of graying cockroaches!

179
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,208
Dyeing your hair won't reduce your age.

180
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,875
You need to cool down, Mom.

181
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,375
You toad! Get out of here.

182
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,208
Sit, man.

183
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:11,833
My daughter ruined her life
the day she married this fraud!

184
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:16,125
- My life hasn't been a party, either!
- Hey, look at that picture.

185
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
This man is sucking the life
out of my last few days.

186
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,625
Look! I'm warning you!

187
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:29,041
If I curse you,
you won't even find a place in hell!

188
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,083
You'll spend your afterlife
drifting in space.

189
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,166
- Mark my words!
- Fine, I'm leaving!

190
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,041
- Get the hell out of here!
- Calm down, I'm going.

191
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,208
- Look at what they've done to my utensils!
- I'm going to spike your tea!

192
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,458
Useless househusband!

193
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,916
Such an animal!
Keeps playing all the time!

194
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,791
- Come out, Shiv. They're gone.
- All clear?

195
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,041
How could you run away, coward!

196
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,750
Just wait, okay?

197
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,916
Chanbi, come out!

198
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,125
Yeah, okay.

199
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,333
Okay, bye.

200
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,708
Bendang's house is locked.

201
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,166
Where's the smoked pork?

202
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,916
You put this later, right?

203
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:59,708
We ran out of gas!
What should we do now?

204
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,041
Didn't you know about it?

205
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,625
How would I know about it?

206
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:13,458
You think I can look inside a cylinder to
check if the gas is running low?

207
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:14,791
You've lost your mind!

208
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,083
It's Minam.

209
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,333
- Everything is under control.
- Yes.

210
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,750
<i>You guys are my guardian angels.
You know that, right?</i>

211
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:54,833
Yeah, alright!

212
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,875
I know that a cylinder doesn't
last more than two months,

213
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,708
and I don't even cook!

214
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,208
Why don't you maintain a schedule?

215
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:08,250
You know everything,
so let me know the exact date and time.

216
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,708
What do we do?

217
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,208
It's not possible now.

218
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:19,500
The cylinder is next to Granny's room
and she's asleep.

219
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:22,083
But there's a way.
You know Gupta's sweet shop?

220
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,958
His <i>jalebis</i> are famous.

221
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,291
His sweets sell out in an hour.
I went there yesterday...

222
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:33,541
Yes! So, Gupta is my guy.
He'll give us a cylinder.

223
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,833
But the Bengali auntie
can get here any minute!

224
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,166
It's right here.
It won't take us more than five minutes!

225
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,791
Five minutes won't be enough!

226
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,916
I swear on my mom!
Not a second more than five minutes.

227
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,333
- One of you just hop on my bike!
- On your bike?

228
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:46,666
I can't go alone!

229
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:47,791
You should go.

230
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,875
Why me? You should go.

231
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,541
I'm not going! I'm not going on his bike.

232
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,416
Ouch!

233
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,583
I can't hold this!

234
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:00,916
Put one hand on the cylinder
and another on me.

235
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,125
I'll fall down, idiot!

236
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,601
- Tell her.
- Hold it with your right hand.

237
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,916
Then, how do I hold the bike?

238
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,240
- With the left hand!
- Then, how do I hold the cylinder?

239
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:11,583
- Put it in front.
- And put my feet on your head?

240
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:14,291
- Oh, God!
- Will you hurry up?

241
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:17,291
I won't. I'll take the cylinder
and go for a movie!

242
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:19,375
- Okay, bye!
- Oh, God!

243
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,416
If you were a real Northeastern
girl, I would have dated you.

244
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,625
I am a real Northeastern girl, idiot!

245
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,073
- Hey, don't get mad.
- Shut up!

246
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:21,083
Put it in my lap.

247
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,083
- Hurry up!
- Here!

248
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:27,458
Ouch!

249
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,861
- It's too heavy!
- What happened?

250
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:29,833
I can't hold it!

251
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,375
Put one hand on the cylinder,
and another on me.

252
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:33,708
I'll fall down!

253
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:36,541
- Oh, God!
- Shiv, listen to me!

254
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,958
- Slow down!
- Why do you talk so much?

255
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:47,500
Stop honking! Hey, slow down!

256
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,166
If you were my girlfriend,
I'd break the cylinder on my head.

257
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:54,375
What are you doing?

258
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,333
What's wrong?

259
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:57,833
Who's this?

260
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,541
She's a tenant.

261
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:00,916
Why haven't I seen her before?

262
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:04,541
She's new. She lives on the first floor.
I had told you about her.

263
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:06,083
What is she doing with you?

264
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:09,083
What do you mean?
You think we are out on a drive

265
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,416
with this cylinder between us?

266
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,666
This is your last warning.

267
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,791
If I see you with another girl...

268
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:22,250
You said... you didn't have a girlfriend?

269
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,500
And you still want
a Northeastern girlfriend?

270
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,166
We're not serious. It's just for fun.

271
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:30,083
We got the gas!

272
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:33,666
We got the gas!

273
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,041
Do you know what time it is?
It's one o'clock!

274
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,041
I've been through hell!

275
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,625
Why didn't you pick up my call?

276
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:40,791
Careful!

277
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:41,916
How do I pick up the call?

278
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,142
I was holding the bike with one
hand and the cylinder with the other.

279
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,875
I'm not the ten-handed Goddess Durga!

280
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,583
- Don't fight, guys!
- Hello, brother!

281
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:49,125
Hi, dear. How are you?

282
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,916
Careful!

283
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:56,791
What do we do now?

284
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,791
Don't worry, I'll sort it out.

285
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,208
What will you tell her?

286
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,125
These guys are new.

287
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,125
They have no idea how
much your food stinks!

288
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,583
- What do you mean?
- I don't have time to explain.

289
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:08,875
It's falling down.

290
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,291
Auntie, you just have to shut
your doors and windows.

291
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,958
So, the smell doesn't get in.

292
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,559
Don't worry, the workers told me

293
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,958
they'll finish cleaning in half an hour.

294
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,208
They just need to repair the septic tank.

295
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,500
- Oh!
- Don't worry.

296
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,583
- Okay?
- Okay!

297
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:28,166
- Do you have a hankie?
- I have a purple one with flowers.

298
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:32,458
- I won't smell the stink, right?
- Not at all. Don't worry.

299
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:33,916
What about Granny?

300
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,166
She's fast asleep.

301
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,916
And she can't do squat
even if she wakes up.

302
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
- Why?
- Because I hid her walking stick!

303
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,500
If you are free in the evening,
please join us.

304
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:49,666
Careful!

305
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,270
Of course, I'll come.
After all, I have to dance at the wedding.

306
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,583
Oh, but we're from the bride's side!

307
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,875
We'll have fun, no problem!

308
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:01,833
She always calls me whenever
I'm having a good time!

309
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,458
Anyway, bye. See you later.

310
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:04,541
Good, he's gone.

311
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,666
You know, I can't stand him,
and you invited him to the wedding?

312
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,041
Move.

313
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,425
- Why did you invite him?
- Where's the <i>axone</i>?

314
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,375
You say you're from Northeast.

315
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:26,041
- Still, you can't tolerate its smell?
- It's because we Nepalis don't make it.

316
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,916
Is that enough?

317
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,458
Why don't you make it
if you're an expert?

318
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:39,250
Hey, I'm saying because
it's three kilos of pork.

319
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,833
It's enough! It's going to stink anyway.

320
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,458
It smells so bad.

321
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:33,916
Hey... Chanbi.

322
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,333
What's happened to the power?

323
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:17,291
Where's my walking stick? Shiv!

324
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,375
Where is it?

325
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,875
Shiv! Someone, find out about the power!

326
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,208
Ouch!

327
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:45,583
Hey! Stop it!

328
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:48,041
Stop cooking that stinky food!

329
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,291
How did she find out?

330
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,250
I'm going to die.

331
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,458
You're killing me!

332
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:53,875
Turn off the gas.

333
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,541
Arrest them!

334
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:56,541
Put it down there.

335
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,291
No, put it inside.

336
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,750
Let me come up there. I won't spare you.

337
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,875
Come! Let's keep it in the fridge.

338
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:10,166
It's very hot! It's very hot!

339
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:23,125
- What should we do now?
- Put it in your closet!

340
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,750
- Why?
- To hide it!

341
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:28,750
I mean, why do we have to put it
in my closet? Why not your closet?

342
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,500
You're stinking up the neighborhood!

343
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:36,750
It's nothing, Auntie. Wait for some time.
They're repairing the septic tank.

344
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:40,625
- I know what's going on inside!
- What happened, Granny?

345
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:44,416
My entire house is
stinking like a gutter.

346
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,250
I don't know what they've done!
Come out!

347
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,583
- Let me teach you a lesson!
- What has happened here?

348
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:52,250
Granny, you look like a sports girl today.

349
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,291
Shut up, and help me!

350
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:58,833
- Granny, we aren't cooking anything.
- Oh, really?

351
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:03,250
You think we're stupid?
Do you think we can't smell anything?

352
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:05,291
You can come and check.

353
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:06,916
What's there to check?

354
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,750
We know you guys are
cooking that shitty food.

355
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,333
Wait a minute! Let me handle this.

356
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:14,583
When you rented this
apartment, I had told you

357
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:15,875
that you can't make...

358
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:18,583
- Come on! Hurry up!
- That stinky food here, didn't I?

359
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,750
We haven't cooked anything, Auntie.

360
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,208
- Shut up!
- What happened, Granny?

361
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:24,333
- Keep quiet!
- Granny, he's the one

362
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,375
who told us about the septic tank.

363
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,750
How could you...
I'm going to stuff you in that tank!

364
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,375
Granny, listen to me.

365
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:34,166
You do this to your own granny?

366
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,291
Move aside.

367
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,750
Who are you?

368
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,125
Who the hell are you?

369
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:42,416
- I...
- Tell me!

370
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,875
- I...
- Why are you lying?

371
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,000
You think we don't know what's smelling?

372
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,208
You aren't even apologizing to Granny!

373
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:49,125
Say sorry!

374
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,916
We're sorry, Granny. We won't do it again.

375
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,833
There's a wedding.
So, we made some.

376
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:57,833
Wedding? You mean, in my house?

377
00:35:57,916 --> 00:36:00,666
We've just invited a few friends.

378
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,250
There will be no bloody
wedding or party in my house!

379
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,458
You heard her.

380
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:08,375
No party!

381
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:12,375
Granny... it's Minam's wedding today.

382
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:15,458
- You should thank God...
- Is this the time to check out clothes?

383
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,958
- I'm letting you live here.
- Zorem isn't picking up.

384
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,333
You can't cook your food
in this house from today!

385
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:22,458
If you do, we'll throw you
out of this neighborhood!

386
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:23,875
Just like they did in Munirka.

387
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,166
Oh! What had happened in Munirka, brother?

388
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:27,708
They all had decided

389
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:30,041
not to rent a place to these people!

390
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:37,541
That's enough. They're just kids.

391
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,041
She's bloody acting!

392
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,333
- Someone check on her. Get some water.
- What's wrong?

393
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,250
- What happened to her?
- Hey, her breathing is heavy.

394
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:56,375
- Granny, I'm just giving her water.
- Upasana, hurry up!

395
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,750
Let me help her!

396
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,291
Such drama!

397
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,291
It's okay. Try again next year!

398
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,416
I'm sure it went well.

399
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,958
We don't need to cook right now.

400
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,291
So, what's the plan?

401
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:31,583
What are you staring at?
India-China friends forever!

402
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:33,166
How can I leave you like that?

403
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:35,541
Come on, let's go.

404
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:37,666
Where are we going?

405
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:34,833
You should date Balamon instead.

406
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:15,958
Move! We don't have all day!

407
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:17,750
Come on, Shiv! You can do it!

408
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,440
- Why did you bring this guy?
- It's a matter of prestige now.

409
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,500
What's going on here?

410
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:28,416
Sorry. We've lost the key, so...

411
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,750
Uncle, you don't need to worry.
They are with me.

412
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,833
- And who the hell are you?
- Me?

413
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:35,000
- Uncle, we are Bendang's friends.
- Who's that?

414
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:38,291
- Bendang, the guy who lives here.
- Every day, I see a new face.

415
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:41,583
Anyway, all of you look the same.
So, how will I know who lives here?

416
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:46,125
If we all look the same, how can
you tell it's a new face every time?

417
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,166
It's open. Let's go.

418
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,666
I don't see the cocktail
party happening here either.

419
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,500
Oh, wow!

420
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:10,916
This is where they rehearse.

421
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:15,333
Where do we even start, dude?

422
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,083
I was in the school band.

423
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:14,375
Robin, hurry up!

424
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:16,958
Why is it taking so long?

425
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,500
Who is it?

426
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:00,208
It's Bendang's girlfriend.

427
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,541
Chanbi, what happened?

428
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:45,875
What are you doing here?

429
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,750
They threw me out,
because I burst a balloon.

430
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:54,250
You don't look well. Listen!

431
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:55,500
Let's go see a doctor.

432
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,583
- We need to find a place to cook first.
- What?

433
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:02,291
- A place to cook.
- The doctor's right here. Come!

434
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,083
Is he good?

435
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:09,750
Good? He's the best in Delhi!

436
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,375
But he's a child specialist!

437
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:15,750
Deep inside, we are all children! Come on!

438
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,541
She's asking how long do we have to wait?

439
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:41,083
She's asking about time. How much time?

440
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:45,666
I can speak English, okay?

441
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:53,583
Who needs this when your
patients are children?

442
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,333
Kids don't take stress,
but they love to give stress.

443
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:08,166
Here, dear.

444
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:11,541
Give me your hand. A little higher.

445
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:14,750
Damn, I forgot my glasses!

446
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,250
150!

447
00:48:20,166 --> 00:48:21,916
Looks like hypertension.

448
00:48:22,791 --> 00:48:24,625
What you had earlier
today was a panic attack.

449
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:26,250
Yes.

450
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,791
But don't worry.

451
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,208
You'll be fine.

452
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,125
It's not what it looks like.

453
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:54,166
She is also a tenant.

454
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:57,833
Oh, really?
Every girl is your tenant, Shiv?

455
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:00,541
They all live together.
What can I do about it?

456
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:02,666
I'm tired of your lies!

457
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,708
I had to take her to the doctor.
She just had a heart attack!

458
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:07,500
Yes.

459
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,500
Look at these pills.

460
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:13,208
Please have these pills! The doctor has
told you to have them, right?

461
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:16,833
Have your medicine. Come on!

462
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:18,833
Shiv, I am fed up of your antics.

463
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:20,416
- Listen...
- Shut up!

464
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,500
You are always seen with different girls!

465
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:26,708
You don't answer my calls!
But you spend time with these girls!

466
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:29,416
- Bunty called me for a game.
- Is she Bunty?

467
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,625
I had to help her.
She is a friend...

468
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:33,375
Why do you have to help everyone?

469
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:35,708
- You don't have time for me!
- Hey, where are you going?

470
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:40,208
Please, go after her.
Drive her around Delhi!

471
00:49:40,333 --> 00:49:43,083
- Baby, why don't you trust me?
- Trust you?

472
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:45,583
I just caught you with two girls!

473
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:46,791
Baby, everyone's looking

474
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:49,125
I don't care if everyone is looking at us!

475
00:49:49,208 --> 00:49:51,041
- Don't call me!
- Listen!

476
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:53,208
Baby, let's go for a coffee?

477
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,000
Do you want some tea?

478
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,541
No.

479
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,125
Jassi, stop it.

480
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:08,916
Why are you shouting at me?
He threw my iPod!

481
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,166
Stop it.

482
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:11,958
Martha's just coming.

483
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:17,291
Is the medicine helping?

484
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
I feel better.

485
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:23,708
- Hey!
- Sorry, I was cooking.

486
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:26,541
Did you find out?

487
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:30,333
These things create a lot of
tension between us and them.

488
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:38,125
Now, whose right is more right? Tell me!

489
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:39,750
But it's Minam's wedding.

490
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:43,458
Did you tell them that you
need to cook for the wedding?

491
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,166
I'd told her we should tell them.

492
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,791
Guys, you can

493
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:51,333
lecture me all you want
when I come tomorrow.

494
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,916
But today, let's not waste time.

495
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,291
There's one place, the community center.
Talk to the secretary.

496
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:00,166
Jassi will take you there.
He knows the place.

497
00:51:00,416 --> 00:51:02,125
What?

498
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:03,333
Come down.

499
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:07,541
What is it?

500
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,916
Come on, let's ask him!

501
00:51:27,541 --> 00:51:30,208
He was wondering

502
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:35,625
if you can see the entire
wall with those small eyes?

503
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,208
Motherfucker!

504
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,583
What did he say?

505
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:45,666
Motherfucker.

506
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:47,166
Shut up!

507
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,333
- Motherfucker! Motherfucker! Motherfucker!
- Shut your mouth!

508
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:52,291
Get lost, both of you!

509
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:56,541
What did you say?
Don't you dare say that again, got it?

510
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,833
You're the one who said that
the <i>axone</i> is not important.

511
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:52,000
You were the one who insisted
we cook no matter what!

512
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,750
Yes.

513
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:56,833
- It's not like that.
- Then?

514
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:03,625
Hold on.

515
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:04,791
What can we do?

516
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:37,625
She's on the phone. Yeah.

517
00:53:37,916 --> 00:53:40,333
What happened?

518
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:52,500
Chanbi went back. She got a call.

519
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,625
Yes, I came to know that.

520
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:00,833
I'm still here,
standing outside the secretary's house.

521
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:04,333
I haven't eaten yet. It's so hot.

522
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:09,333
He's here. I'll call you back.

523
00:57:10,666 --> 00:57:13,041
Martha has sent me.

524
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,916
She had called you before sometime.

525
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:16,583
Who?

526
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,083
Sunny's wife.

527
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:22,166
Yes, sure.

528
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:46,166
Dear, can you tell me what work it is?
Remind me.

529
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's nothing, sir.

530
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:59,166
I... I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

531
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,791
But you said someone had called me.

532
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:06,041
Yes. Sorry, Uncle! It was a mistake.

533
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,333
Yes, bye.

534
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,625
He got some neighborhood
kid to lock him in his room.

535
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:39,125
He was inside the whole time.

536
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,083
He didn't turn up.

537
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,583
Didn't turn up?

538
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:52,375
He just didn't come.

539
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:54,666
So, what about <i>axone</i>?

540
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,375
It's Minam.

541
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,208
It's her wedding.

542
01:02:02,916 --> 01:02:05,166
- Don't you have a table fan?
- No.

543
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:07,625
I'm going. Finish it quickly.

544
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,291
Oh, God!

545
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:36,500
<i>Yet another shameful incident from Delhi.</i>

546
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:38,208
<i>Our exclusive footage shows how...</i>

547
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:42,333
<i>Bendang Longkumer from Nagaland</i>

548
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:45,416
<i>was brutally beaten up in
the crowded Lajpat Nagar market</i>

549
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,083
<i>until he became unconscious.</i>

550
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:48,208
<i>Our sources say,</i>

551
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:52,958
<i>he was picked on by
some men at a dairy shop</i>

552
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:57,583
<i>in Lajpat Nagar market, simply
because he colored his hair blonde.</i>

553
01:03:57,666 --> 01:03:59,666
<i>When Bendang protested,</i>

554
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:03,208
<i>you can see how they attacked
him with hockey sticks and rods.</i>

555
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:05,875
<i>Look how they are beating him mercilessly!</i>

556
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:09,250
<i>We must warn you,
these images are violent and disturbing.</i>

557
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:12,833
<i>Bendang's life hangs by
a thread in the hospital.</i>

558
01:05:33,583 --> 01:05:35,083
What's going on here?

559
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,625
How can I help you?

560
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,333
- What's going on?
- We're cooking.

561
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:44,625
- You are cooking?
- Yes.

562
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,375
But we're the ones who have to cook.

563
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,500
And what's this stench?

564
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:52,208
You guys are early.

565
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:55,250
We're on time!
We're booked for three o'clock.

566
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:58,333
Just give them half an hour,
they'll leave.

567
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:00,458
- Where's Ram Prasad?
- He's not here.

568
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:02,750
It's just a matter of half an hour.

569
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:04,458
No, we can't do that.

570
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:07,333
- You should talk to ma'am.
- What's the matter?

571
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:09,500
Auntie, they just need half an hour.

572
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:10,875
Half an hour?

573
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:12,081
The guests will come soon.

574
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:14,245
- It's my grandson's first birthday.
- Please, Auntie.

575
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:18,291
Brother, half an hour turns into
an hour when you start cooking.

576
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:19,625
Our food is almost done.

577
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:23,791
Where's Ram Prasad?

578
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:25,541
Call him.

579
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:26,833
He's coming.

580
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,541
Is he your husband?

581
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:29,791
Yes, why?

582
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:31,833
He harassed me this morning in the market,

583
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:34,250
and when I complained, he slapped me.

584
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:36,250
Who are you? Why are you lying?

585
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:37,666
I don't know her.

586
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:39,833
- It was this guy?
- Yes.

587
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:42,041
You've forgotten me so soon?

588
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:43,375
Who are you?

589
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,708
Why are you spreading lies about my son?

590
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,666
Do you know her?

591
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,750
I don't know her... How dare you ask me!

592
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:51,041
She's lying.

593
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,416
So, now I'm a liar?

594
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:55,791
Have you forgotten how
you slapped me in the market?

595
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:59,041
Ma'am, you're mistaken.
I don't know you.

596
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,708
Your husband assaults women.

597
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:03,208
Please, just shut up!

598
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,000
Let's go, please.

599
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:07,333
I'm sure, he beats you as well.
Don't you protest?

600
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:09,500
That's enough or I'll slap you again!

601
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:10,666
- Try it!
- Hey!

602
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:13,750
I know girls like you very well!

603
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:15,833
All you girls have pimp-husbands!

604
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:20,708
They send you here in skimpy
clothes to ensnare our boys!

605
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,541
Let's go outside!

606
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:30,559
If my family wasn't here,
I would have thrashed all of you.

607
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:31,583
Quiet!

608
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:35,541
You've embarrassed us enough.

609
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:37,708
He must have learned it from you.

610
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:42,041
Let's go.

611
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:48,625
Please, leave.
We need to start our cooking.

612
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:02,958
- Tell me the story again.
- Yes.

613
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:08,083
A ship carrying hundreds of
passengers sank on the high seas.

614
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,791
Among the few who survived, was a woman.

615
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:14,625
But all four of her daughters had drowned.

616
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:17,750
She telegraphed her husband,
who set sail at once.

617
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:23,666
As his ship passed by the shipwreck,
he was overwhelmed with grief.

618
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:27,708
And as he tried to make sense

619
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:30,166
of the loss of his beloved daughters

620
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:33,208
he wrote a song.

621
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:44,291
<i>When peace like a river.</i>

622
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:48,500
<i>Attendeth my way.</i>

623
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,083
<i>When sorrows...</i>

624
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:56,583
<i>Like sea billows roll.</i>

625
01:08:58,291 --> 01:09:01,500
<i>Whatever my lot...</i>

626
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:05,916
<i>Thou hast taught me to say.</i>

627
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:08,458
<i>It is well.</i>

628
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:11,375
<i>It is well...</i>

629
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:16,833
<i>With my soul.</i>

630
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:21,291
<i>It is well...</i>

631
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:25,125
<i>With my soul.</i>

632
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:31,083
<i>It is well...</i>

633
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:35,375
<i>With my soul.</i>

634
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:46,833
He controls you so much.

635
01:10:47,916 --> 01:10:49,250
It's not like that.

636
01:10:57,958 --> 01:11:00,916
We have problems, but who doesn't?

637
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,208
You and Bendang have problems as well.

638
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,125
Bendang doesn't control me.

639
01:11:06,416 --> 01:11:09,208
It's you who controls him! All the time!

640
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:12,208
I don't!

641
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:21,125
For you and Minam, career is important.

642
01:11:22,916 --> 01:11:25,416
For me, it's more important that
I get married and settle down.

643
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,458
Has Zorem ever said he will marry you?

644
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:31,416
Zorem never says anything.

645
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:17,416
Hey, look what you did!

646
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,000
It's not like I did it on purpose!

647
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:23,875
No! You do this every day.
Don't you have any manners?

648
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:25,250
I was watering my plants.

649
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:27,291
What can I do if you
walk by at that time?

650
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:29,166
I know men like you

651
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,750
who just sit in the house,
while your wives go to work!

652
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:34,291
Why don't you take some other route, then?

653
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:38,416
I was going to my girlies' party.
Now, I'm completely drenched.

654
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:40,166
So, walk on the other side of the path.

655
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,958
Why don't you push back your building!

656
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,750
Oh, yes! Please, help me!

657
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:07,208
Don't you worry about Dad!

658
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:09,750
I'll handle him.
I know how to butter him up.

659
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:13,625
Dad, it's Minam's wedding
and she lives here.

660
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,958
How can Granny stop her
from inviting her friends?

661
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:18,458
Your granny didn't tell
me anything about this.

662
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:20,583
Tell you? She should have
checked with you first!

663
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:25,083
But Granny has never bothered
to check with you, anyway.

664
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:27,750
I get it.
Danny, what are you cooking?

665
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:29,791
Our special dish.

666
01:13:31,041 --> 01:13:32,291
Okay, go ahead.

667
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:34,208
I'll handle the witch!

668
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:36,500
She is not aware of what I can do!

669
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:43,625
Why do we always
fight like cats and dogs?

670
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:48,166
We're always at each other's throats.

671
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:52,583
- I don't know why...
- I pick up a fight?

672
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:53,791
Then, who else?

673
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:59,583
Who helped you when you lost your job?

674
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:02,541
- It must be you!
- Yes, that's correct!

675
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:07,125
I get that government officers

676
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:10,333
can't survive without bribes,

677
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:13,750
but you are the only one to get caught.

678
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:15,666
You brought dishonor to our family!

679
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:21,750
Yet, I let you squat in my house.

680
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,881
- You're always yapping around!
- Careful, Mom!

681
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:27,250
Sit properly or you'll hurt yourself.

682
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:28,875
- You scared me.
- I am sorry.

683
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:34,250
Now go for the other leg.

684
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:36,445
Shall I go for your neck instead?

685
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:39,416
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

686
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,500
Always yapping!

687
01:14:41,541 --> 01:14:46,458
I know they're tenants,
but this is where they live.

688
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,767
You won't even let
the poor girl get married,

689
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:51,875
and you scared the other one so much.

690
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:55,208
She had a heart attack.

691
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,916
Yes, heart attack!

692
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:02,916
Shiv said he had
to take her to our doctor.

693
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,666
Panic attack, not heart attack.

694
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:10,208
Ouch! That hurt!

695
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,851
- No, I...
- Do you want to break my bones?

696
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:13,791
It's all knotted up.

697
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,916
- What was that?
- It's nothing. I'll go and check.

698
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,416
Get some rest.

699
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,208
You might get a cramp.

700
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:21,541
- Leave!
- I still have to do the other leg.

701
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:23,833
- I'll come with you.
- No, you'll sprain yourself.

702
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,583
Very good!

703
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:27,791
- I'll come.
- No, stay here!

704
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:34,833
Who's making noise?

705
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:40,291
Who's making noise here?

706
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:42,416
What is this?

707
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:44,333
It's a gas cylinder.

708
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,083
Idiot, I can see that!
What's it doing here?

709
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:49,916
We need to cook, right?

710
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:53,416
And what about the one that's upstairs?

711
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:55,791
Minam's already reached. It's a surprise.

712
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:58,708
<i>Hey! Where's my walking stick?</i>

713
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:00,375
It must be next to you.

714
01:16:01,125 --> 01:16:02,208
This can't go upstairs.

715
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:03,875
How will we cook, then?

716
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:06,541
If this thing explodes,

717
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:11,083
it'll burn down my building!
Then, you'll understand!

718
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:13,333
It's Granny's building!

719
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:16,166
<i>- Where the hell are you?</i>
- Granny's bloody pet!

720
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:19,958
<i>- Did you hide my walking stick?</i>
- Why would I hide it?

721
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:23,541
<i>- Such a liar!</i>
- Take that old contraption.

722
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:29,250
<i>You father and son have
made my life miserable!</i>

723
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:31,083
<i>I'll tell my daughter everything.</i>

724
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:32,000
What old contraption?

725
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:35,833
The one that we used
before we switched to gas.

726
01:16:36,166 --> 01:16:37,791
Why would I hide your walking stick?

727
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:39,750
Oh, that one!

728
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,416
<i>- Oh, God! I've fallen down. Help me!</i>
- We're doomed.

729
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:44,625
Granny, what happened?

730
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:46,068
- Did you fall again?
- Such drama!

731
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:48,125
Where did you keep your walking stick?

732
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:56,125
You saw that?

733
01:17:02,041 --> 01:17:03,083
Will this work?

734
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,070
- We don't have a choice.
- I have to go. Granny's in pain.

735
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:09,000
Yes?

736
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:13,791
Are you sure?

737
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:28,375
What's going on?

738
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:30,750
We're cooking.

739
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:31,958
On the roof?

740
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:34,708
What are you doing?

741
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,291
Same old household chores.

742
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:37,708
Oh, okay.

743
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,458
What are you cooking?

744
01:18:44,166 --> 01:18:45,166
Good!

745
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:16,583
Are you going to a fancy-dress party?

746
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:20,125
Look, look!
Fashion parade at Granny's house!

747
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,666
Is it Jackie Chan's birthday?

748
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,125
Where are you going all decked up?

749
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:24,500
Are we invited?

750
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,958
What's the matter? Tell me!

751
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,666
Why are you crowding here?

752
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:36,541
You think it's some circus show?

753
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:41,625
Go home everyone!

754
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,541
Scoot!

755
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:46,625
Come on!

756
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:50,041
Move!

757
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,291
This is beautiful, dude!

758
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:22,333
I never thought this room
would look so pretty, dude!

759
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:30,541
- What do you mean?
- Bendang and I are going back home.

760
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:34,625
I'm so happy for you, dude!

761
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,458
But how so suddenly?

762
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:41,208
When did you decide?

763
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:49,875
I had to respond to the email
regarding the new job.

764
01:22:56,333 --> 01:22:58,375
I have made Bendang wait for so long.

765
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:01,458
But, listen! What will you do there?

766
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:04,541
I'll figure out something.

767
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:07,375
It's been ten years in Delhi.

768
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:14,166
You're leaving.

769
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:36,833
Look what I have to do for love!

770
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:41,416
<i>Love is stupid -Love is stupid.</i>

771
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:45,041
<i>- It's a twisted arrow.
- It's a twisted arrow.</i>

772
01:23:45,583 --> 01:23:49,916
<i>- It knows no joy, knows no...
- It knows no joy, knows no...</i>

773
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:51,416
Who invited Hyper?

774
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:53,958
Ain't I killing it?

775
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:56,625
I left the India-Sri Lanka
cricket match for this.

776
01:23:58,375 --> 01:24:02,791
Of course!
Who doesn't know this sneaky fellow!

777
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:04,625
He slithers in every night like a snake

778
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:06,434
and sneaks out at dawn
before anyone can spot him.

779
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,625
Bro, you must teach me your ways!

780
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:11,375
Minam loves fairy lights.

781
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:36,375
Look at it this way!

782
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:51,375
<i>Hi, sister!</i>

783
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:52,375
Are you okay?

784
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:54,958
<i>I'm fine. How was your exam?</i>

785
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:56,125
It was okay.

786
01:26:57,541 --> 01:27:01,333
- You look so beautiful!
<i>- Thank you, and so do you.</i>

787
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:11,375
<i>Yes! Here, meet everyone.</i>

788
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:14,041
- Oh! Hi, Uncle!
<i>- Hi, Minam.</i>

789
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:16,458
Hi, Auntie!

790
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:20,208
<i>You look so beautiful, Minam.</i>

791
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:22,875
<i>I wish you were here with us.</i>

792
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:24,958
How I wish I was there, too!

793
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:27,500
I do!

794
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:29,125
<i>- Hey!</i>
- Hi, sister!

795
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:30,583
<i>You should be here instead of me.</i>

796
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:36,375
<i>And say hi to everyone, please.</i>

797
01:27:41,416 --> 01:27:44,083
Is it Minam's wedding, or her sister's?

798
01:27:44,166 --> 01:27:49,208
It's Minam's, but her sister is
replacing her in the ceremony.

799
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,208
What do you mean?

800
01:27:52,458 --> 01:27:53,791
To take someone's place.

801
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:55,541
Hey, I understand English!

802
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:58,125
I mean, how can you replace
someone in a wedding?

803
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,583
The wedding is taking place there,

804
01:27:59,666 --> 01:28:02,125
but it's Minam and Chimar
who are getting married.

805
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:05,541
- But why isn't Minam there?
- Because her exam's going on.

806
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:08,750
Do you see that old woman?
That's Chimar's grandmother.

807
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:11,291
She just had a heart attack.
She may die any moment.

808
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,250
Sure it wasn't a panic attack?

809
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,625
So, is this how all of you get married?

810
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:33,208
This happens only in Minam's tribe.

811
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:35,670
An ancient ritual which
is not practiced anymore.

812
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:40,500
I badly need a drink.

813
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:47,250
Your marriages are strange.

814
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:49,958
How can the bride be replaced?

815
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:52,875
And if the real wedding's there,

816
01:28:53,083 --> 01:28:54,208
shouldn't everyone be there?

817
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:56,583
It makes no sense at all.

818
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,250
It's complicated.

819
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:02,166
By the way, what were
you doing locked inside?

820
01:29:02,458 --> 01:29:04,125
Didn't you hear us?

821
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:05,583
It was I who broke the lock.

822
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:09,416
Did you have a girl with you?

823
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:11,666
Bro, I also want
a Northeastern girlfriend.

824
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:44,000
<i>But this is an emergency so...</i>

825
01:29:44,583 --> 01:29:46,000
He called me a "fucking Indian."

826
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:55,041
You guys don't think you are Indian?

827
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:04,625
How sad is that, dude!

828
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:15,750
I'm sorry, bro.

829
01:30:45,708 --> 01:30:46,916
Wow! Three wickets in 30 runs?

830
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:05,833
Look at that handsome boy!

831
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:07,833
<i>Thank you. I guess, it's the hat.</i>

832
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,583
You still look good without the hat.

833
01:32:14,541 --> 01:32:18,833
<i>Yet you are there, and I am here.</i>

834
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:21,541
<i>I wish you were here with me.</i>

835
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:23,166
<i>I miss you a lot.</i>

836
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:43,791
<i>Lift your feet & dance away.</i>

837
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:49,000
<i>Sing a melody, make the heart sway.</i>

838
01:32:53,583 --> 01:32:58,041
<i>Joy & woe are woven fine.</i>

839
01:32:58,666 --> 01:33:01,541
<i>So, go ahead & spread some smiles.</i>

840
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:06,666
<i>Lift your feet & dance away.</i>

841
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:09,333
<i>Sing a melody, make the heart sway.</i>

842
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:13,041
<i>Joy & woe are woven fine.</i>

843
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:16,333
<i>So, go ahead & spread some smiles.</i>

844
01:33:23,541 --> 01:33:26,541
<i>Lift your feet & dance away.</i>

845
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:29,666
<i>Sing a melody, make the heart sway.</i>

846
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:32,708
<i>Joy & woe are woven fine.</i>

847
01:33:33,208 --> 01:33:35,958
<i>So, go ahead & spread some smiles.</i>

848
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:39,833
<i>Those lovely days & nights.</i>

849
01:33:39,916 --> 01:33:44,250
<i>- The indelible meetings at...
- Twilight!</i>

850
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:47,291
<i>- No sorrows, no cries.
- No sorrows, no cries.</i>

851
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:50,750
<i>- Ever since I've had you in my life.
- Ever since I've had you in my life.</i>

852
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:55,875
<i>- You are the fire & I'm the ice.
- You are the fire & I'm the ice.</i>

853
01:33:56,416 --> 01:33:59,416
<i>- Joy & woe are woven fine.
- Joy & woe are woven fine.</i>

854
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,380
<i>- So, go ahead & spread some smiles.
- So, go ahead & spread some smiles.</i>

855
01:34:19,166 --> 01:34:20,875
Bro, this song is also Indian.

856
01:34:23,583 --> 01:34:25,083
It's okay, brother. It happens.

857
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,250
What's the matter?

858
01:34:33,416 --> 01:34:34,666
Why did you take me outside?

859
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,250
You'll marry me!

860
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:05,208
- Really?
- Yes, dude.

861
01:36:06,541 --> 01:36:07,541
But

862
01:36:08,791 --> 01:36:11,000
didn't she just start working with you?

863
01:36:14,416 --> 01:36:16,750
That was quick!

864
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,750
A proposal in the hallway
and a wedding in the bedroom!

865
01:36:21,666 --> 01:36:24,166
- Does she have a younger sister?
- You mean, my sister-in-law?

866
01:36:30,166 --> 01:36:32,666
No, no. Don't have it yet.

867
01:36:57,583 --> 01:36:58,833
No. We made it.

868
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:01,583
- Come on, give me a plate!
- One second!

869
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:24,791
I love you, dude.

870
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:26,375
This is amazing, bro!

871
01:37:26,708 --> 01:37:28,416
Hey, come here!

872
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,041
I love both of you.

873
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:51,875
Come on, chill!

874
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:54,708
What do you want?

875
01:38:55,916 --> 01:39:00,500
Is there some <i>dal makhni,</i>
paneer curry or naan?

876
01:39:00,916 --> 01:39:02,041
We don't have all that.

877
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:05,166
Are you not eating?

878
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:06,875
I'm eating.

879
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:08,333
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

880
01:39:09,291 --> 01:39:12,416
- You want some more?
- No, I'm still eating.

881
01:39:13,083 --> 01:39:14,291
Hironya's calling me.

882
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:16,575
- Are you sure you don't want it?
- Hironya, I'm coming!
