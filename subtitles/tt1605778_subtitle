1
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:03,396
We're going ahead, and
you're left behind.

2
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:05,266
You car is slow.

3
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,700
What do you care? lt's our car.

4
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:11,238
Papa that train crossed
ahead as well.

5
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,813
Son, train always travels
faster than the car.

6
00:02:15,582 --> 00:02:17,049
And cycle? -Well..

7
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:20,085
That does too.

8
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:23,187
l can't see your face.

9
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:24,314
Keep this at the back.

10
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:25,652
lt will break.

11
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:27,421
Don't you remember? This
is the glass vase..

12
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,428
..which Mrs. Rai gifted
us on our anniversary.

13
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:30,987
Since then l've been thinking..

14
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:32,189
..who can l gift it, so that
l don't get it back.

15
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:53,419
Hello. -Hello.

16
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:54,986
Hello. Congratulations.

17
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:56,347
Oh, you're here too.

18
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,418
Listen, this is sister
Rajeshwari.

19
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:00,189
And brother Surinder. -Hello.

20
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:03,328
And Sister, he's.. -l
know. He's Mohan.

21
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:07,926
Mohan, you're very fortunate
that you got our Sarita.

22
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:10,592
Otherwise, all the boys
in our neighbourhood..

23
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,796
..got close to her but
didn't get her.

24
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:19,574
l mean, she rejected
every boy she met.

25
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:33,192
Let's get a photograph taken.

26
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:35,684
You stand beside Sarita.

27
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:38,160
And l'll stand alongside Mohan.

28
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,799
You won't come in the picture
if you stand here.

29
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:42,800
Pick him up in your arms.

30
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:47,298
Just a minute.

31
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:48,732
You won't come either.

32
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:51,700
A little to the left. Please.

33
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:53,443
Okay, ready?

34
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:55,011
Okay, smile.

35
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:56,649
Thank you.

36
00:03:57,684 --> 00:03:59,311
Do you remember Mrs. Chawla's
marriage?

37
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:00,945
lt's nice.

38
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:04,881
lsn't this fourth? -No Mama,
this is an ice-cream.

39
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,053
He's very smart. -Actually..

40
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:12,462
..Rajeshwari, even l can't
control myself over ice-cream.

41
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:13,998
That's right.

42
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,869
But just see the ice-cream that
they've served vanilla.

43
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:21,168
Butterscotch, almonds
and raisins.

44
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,237
They're expensive. -Right.

45
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:27,442
l've heard that they've spent
a lot on the wedding.

46
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,348
Money can't teach
you etiquettes.

47
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:32,878
You should have taste as well.

48
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,882
Carefully.

49
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:38,715
Rajeshwari, they've found
a suitable groom.

50
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:44,027
Hi.

51
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:48,264
The truth is, l didn't like
him one bit. -Why?

52
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:49,700
What's wrong with him?

53
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:54,172
Listen, there's nothing
wrong in this world.

54
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:56,268
Everything is good.

55
00:04:57,177 --> 00:04:58,474
lt's about matching

56
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:02,711
Such a highly educated girl.

57
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:06,014
And l've heard that the
boy has only a diploma.

58
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:08,081
He doesn't even have
a degree. -Really?

59
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:10,613
Both of them will look like..

60
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,386
Mrs. Rai.

61
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:19,630
Eastman colour.

62
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:24,001
She has worn every colour on her
person. From sari to purse.

63
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,268
Bravo.

64
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,098
Everyone's laughing.

65
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:32,971
What are you all joking
about? -About you.

66
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:36,182
What do you mean?

67
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,417
Your tenant. We were
talking about him.

68
00:05:41,254 --> 00:05:42,744
Haven't you thrown him out yet?

69
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,085
l'll ask him to vacate
the room on the first.

70
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,792
He won't find another
room immediately.

71
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,791
lt will take four to five days.

72
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:53,888
And then..

73
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:58,531
l'll have the entire month's
rent for myself.

74
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,337
Rajeshwari.

75
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:06,207
What gift did you give the
bride and the groom?

76
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,581
Looking at the size..
ls it a flower vase?

77
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:15,582
lt is. The one you gifted me.

78
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:17,156
Happy?

79
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,719
Listen. Please repair the hook
of the wedding necklace.

80
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:24,753
lt came off thrice at
the wedding too.

81
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:26,195
lt's come loose.

82
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,297
l've been asking you for so
long to buy me a new one.

83
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,700
lf it has loosened,
so, get it fixed.

84
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,539
Why do you need a new one?
-The fashion has changed.

85
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:41,045
You've a knack of changing
old things.

86
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:43,945
Television, fridge, telephone,
wedding necklace..

87
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:45,149
That's not it.

88
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:49,988
l still have one old thing
which l'll never change.

89
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:51,991
What's that?

90
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,057
l'll withdraw the money
from the bank..

91
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:00,524
..for the wedding necklace
tomorrow.

92
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,194
You're so nice.

93
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:05,728
You always do whatever l say.

94
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:08,936
But you haven't given the room
upstairs for rent yet.

95
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:11,304
That job is done as well.

96
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:15,070
Uncle Gajendra called
from Benares.

97
00:07:16,116 --> 00:07:17,981
His friend's son has got a job.

98
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,151
And he.. -And he wants
that room for free.

99
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:21,414
Therefore, he remembered
his nephew.

100
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:23,578
Give the room for
free, and then..

101
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,720
..tea, coffee, breakfast
and lunch everything.

102
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:28,892
We don't want to do
social service.

103
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:32,796
Mrs. Rai's pigeon house..has
been rented out for Rs.1000.

104
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,958
And our room is a grand
manor compared to that.

105
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:38,470
We won't charge anything
less than Rs.1200.

106
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:39,401
That's it.

107
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:42,203
You'll get the rent.

108
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:43,871
Let's do a Laxmi-Ganesh.

109
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,814
Look, it's Laxmi.

110
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:53,715
That means, concentrate
on the money.

111
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:55,948
With Rs.1200 as rent..

112
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:58,221
..we can fulfil many
of our requirements.

113
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:02,055
The children have grown up,
they need a computer.

114
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,056
And Nisha.

115
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:06,197
We've to get Nisha
married as well.

116
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:11,402
You know, these days whenever
l see a nice boy..

117
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:14,071
..l start thinking whether
he'll suit Nisha or not.

118
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,738
l've dreamt about this
since she was small.

119
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:20,812
That l'll get her married
very grandly.

120
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:22,105
She'll have a huge house.

121
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:24,039
A big car.

122
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,144
And the boy will be a prince.

123
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,119
We'll find a gem of
a boy for her.

124
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:31,750
And everyone will be
stunned to see him.

125
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:01,515
l'm..l'm sorry..l'm
really sorry.

126
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:02,887
Yes, yes.

127
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:04,885
lt's the grace of
God. -l'm sorry.

128
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,516
Otherwise, you'd almost
killed me.

129
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,953
No, actually, you were walking
in the middle of the road..

130
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,326
Otherwise.. -So what?

131
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,393
Will you kill me? -No,
no. l was just..

132
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,397
Actually, l did some work on
my engine. So, l was just..

133
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,930
Look, it stopped instantly
even at the speed of 80.

134
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:21,906
You're wonderful. -You
did a good job.

135
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:25,138
l'm sorry. -lf you like
speeding that much..

136
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:26,571
..then go for Olympics.

137
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:27,709
Should l throw it away?

138
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,306
Why do you trouble
the pedestrians?

139
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,276
This is our road.

140
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:34,150
We pay tax to the government.

141
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,050
And my husband is the cashier
in a government bank.

142
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:38,988
Look, it isn't all my fault.

143
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:41,185
Yet l apologise. So, that's it.

144
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:43,592
Forget it, madam. Let it be.

145
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:45,089
Forgive him.

146
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,729
Did l ask for advice?

147
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:51,192
And what's all this?

148
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,495
Are we shooting for a television
reality show?

149
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:54,534
Don't you've work?

150
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:56,197
Leave. Come on, leave.

151
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:58,467
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

152
00:09:58,745 --> 00:09:59,871
And you.

153
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:03,477
lf l see you speeding your
motorcycle again..

154
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,180
..l'll dismantle all the parts.

155
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:07,446
Of the engine, and
yours as well.

156
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,889
Likes to show-off the speed.

157
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:14,181
Leave it.

158
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,791
Listen, the key.

159
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:29,171
And that's a six.

160
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,713
What is it? -lce-cream,
ice-cream.

161
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:54,733
Shlok, come here.

162
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:57,159
Show me your hand.

163
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:04,806
lce-cream. -No ice-cream.

164
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,176
You get a sore throat easily.

165
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,270
lsn't it? Go.

166
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:16,818
You're just..

167
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,153
He doesn't know what's
best for him.

168
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,092
He wanted to.. -He'll
understand later..

169
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:25,323
..that we did the right thing.

170
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:28,058
But if.. -Fine, l understood.

171
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:31,369
You've a habit of arguing
with everyone.

172
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,337
No, l mean you always
argue with me..

173
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:37,474
..but you argued with
that boy as well.

174
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:39,608
Who? That goon.

175
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,174
l'm not going to be afraid
of some goon.

176
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,140
l call a spade a spade.
That's it.

177
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,547
There's a boy here to
meet you. -Which boy?

178
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:50,046
He's tall and fair.

179
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,584
And he has muscles.

180
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,951
And he's here on a bike.

181
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:05,366
So, are you here to vandalise?

182
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:07,639
To use strong-arm tactics.

183
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:09,205
What did you feel?

184
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:12,133
lf you come home,
l'll be scared?

185
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,410
Leave quietly.

186
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:17,673
Otherwise, l'll thrash you so
hard, you'll forget your name.

187
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:19,914
Rahul Saxena. -What?

188
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:21,081
That's my name.

189
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:23,515
lf you hit me before l complete
what l'm here to say..

190
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,983
..then you can remind
me of my name.

191
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:29,657
Are you here to joke with me?
-No, to return this purse.

192
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,224
You left it on the street
in the morning.

193
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:35,195
Count it, it must all be there.

194
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,902
No, there was an
important paper.

195
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,206
l was looking for that.

196
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:46,142
Someone on the streets told me..

197
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:48,440
..that you live in
our neighbourhood.

198
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:52,746
So, l asked for your address
and.. -Oh, you live here.

199
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:55,211
Where? -With Mrs. Rai.

200
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:57,583
But you're Saxena.

201
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,157
So, how can you be Mrs. Rai's
relative?

202
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:00,757
No, l'm her tenant.

203
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,918
l'm studying in the engineering
college here.

204
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:05,462
Engineering.

205
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:14,165
That's why you keep repairing
your motorcycle.

206
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:15,435
Oh, no. That's my hobby.

207
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,266
By the way, l'm not
doing mechanical..

208
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:18,934
..but civil engineering.

209
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,740
Whatever. But you're doing
engineering, aren't you?

210
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,108
Yes, final year.

211
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:24,205
Okay, l'll leave now.

212
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:32,248
Hey..

213
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,387
What did you say your name
was? -Rahul Saxena.

214
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:36,759
We're Saxenas too.

215
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:38,121
l 'M Rajeshwari. -Really?

216
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:40,461
And this is Surinder,
my husband. -Hello.

217
00:13:42,802 --> 00:13:43,769
Nice to meet you.

218
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,668
Which village are you
from? -Biruwa.

219
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:48,195
District Azamgarh.

220
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:49,533
We're from Jaunpur.

221
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,272
Sir, that's a nice
car. Nice car.

222
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,747
Yes, my grandfather..

223
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:00,376
He's from Azamgarh.

224
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:02,918
Final year, engineering.

225
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,184
Rahul..Rahul Saxena.

226
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:18,525
Nisha and Rahul will look really
nice as a couple, won't they?

227
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:23,304
Yes.

228
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,005
He's absolutely suited
for your sister.

229
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:30,012
But..

230
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:32,951
Don't always interfere
with your buts.

231
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:35,948
l'll have to, if you
fly too high.

232
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,691
Rahul is doing engineering.

233
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,023
Do you know the rates of
the boys these days?

234
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:47,359
lAS officer, from 50
lakh to 1 crore.

235
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:52,696
Doctor or engineer, 20-25 lakh.

236
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,206
These people charge that
much to get married.

237
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:03,308
We're.. -Not everyone is
concerned about money.

238
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:05,307
Some are more concerned
about the girl.

239
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:08,276
And you didn't ask for
any dowry as well.

240
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,185
l'm neither good looking
nor intelligent.

241
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,087
Otherwise, l would've got
an engineering degree..

242
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,821
..and dowry as well. -no.

243
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:22,766
But l've decided that Nisha
and Rahul will get married.

244
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,562
Now that you've decided, even
God can't save Rahul.

245
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:31,805
How are you? Rajesh. -Hello.

246
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:33,245
Pankaj.

247
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:36,013
Shaukat, how are you?
-Fine, how are you?

248
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:37,208
Absolutely fine.

249
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,710
Shaukat, make a betel-leaf
for me.

250
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:44,082
Look..it's my job to
make betel-leaves.

251
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:46,751
First, give the money, and
then take your betel-leaf.

252
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,192
l follow just one rule.

253
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:52,691
Friends are good,
but credit isn't.

254
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:55,924
Can l say something, Shaukat?
-Yes, go on.

255
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,525
There is no charge for talking.

256
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,533
Might not be in other places.

257
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,700
But in your place, we've
to pay for everything.

258
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:03,732
What are you saying?

259
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:07,909
What if l prove that you charge
pay for talking here?

260
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:10,540
Then l'll do anything you say.

261
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,839
Fine, tell me one thing.

262
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,076
Everyone uses a cell-phone
to talk. -Yes.

263
00:16:14,186 --> 00:16:15,585
You refill the balance in
the cell-phone. -Yes.

264
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:16,952
And you even charge
money for it. -Yes.

265
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,421
That means you charge for
talking as well. -Yes.

266
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,888
Yes.

267
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,826
Come on, keep your promise
now. -What?

268
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:32,230
Refill my mobile balance today
without charging anything..

269
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:34,397
..on credit. -l'll pay the
money tomorrow. For sure.

270
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:41,478
Sister.

271
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:44,647
l'll be right back.

272
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:53,182
He's coming.

273
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,192
Sister. Sister.

274
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:57,693
Oh, you. -Rahul Saxena.

275
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:00,223
Yes, l recognised you. -l see.

276
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,628
How are you, Rahul?
-Absolutely fine.

277
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:05,234
Come, l'll drop you. My
bike is right there.

278
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:09,197
You won't listen if l refuse.

279
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:10,839
But we'll walk.

280
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:14,704
Have you finished smoking,
or do you need to go back?

281
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,543
Oh, no. l don't smoke.

282
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,347
Then you must be eating
betel-leaf. -No, not even that.

283
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,847
l came here to refill
my cell-phone.

284
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:26,315
Sometimes in the evening,
my friends gather here.

285
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:29,456
We talk about different things,
it changes the mood.

286
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:31,720
That's absolutely right.

287
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:36,157
You can't spend the entire day
in college or with Mrs. Rai.

288
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:41,566
So, tell me, how is Mrs. Rai.
-She's fine.

289
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:44,837
Do you know, that tomorrow..

290
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:47,141
..that is on the first..

291
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,541
..she'll ask you to vacate
the room? -No.

292
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:56,416
Do you know where
you'll go? -No.

293
00:17:57,022 --> 00:18:01,652
You do know that you won't find
a room instantly. -Yes.

294
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:05,823
Then she'll say, Fine, you can
stay here a few more days.

295
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:09,601
And charge you the entire
month's rent.

296
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,462
l didn't know that.
-You should know.

297
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:16,405
The world is very selfish,

298
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:21,904
Anyway, you do know the address
of our house, don't you?

299
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:26,577
Yes, l do. -Look,
you're a Saxena.

300
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:28,041
You belong to our community.

301
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:32,954
So, whenever Rai tells you
to vacate the room..

302
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,888
..you can take your stuff
and come to my house.

303
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:38,220
To your house. -Yes.

304
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:41,390
Consider that there's
a room vacant..

305
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,559
..especially for you
in our house.

306
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:46,330
And don't tell Mrs. Rai
about this.

307
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:51,834
lt's a very nice room.

308
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:53,200
Come in. -Yes.

309
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:57,215
You can see the rising sun
from here in the morning.

310
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,014
And you wake up to the
chirping of the birds.

311
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:03,551
And if you look out the window,
you'll see greenery.

312
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:05,149
You'll be able to concentrate
on your studies..

313
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:06,383
..and top your class.

314
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,253
Sister, how much rent
will l've to pay?

315
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:16,024
Look, l like everything..

316
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:20,565
..but not when kin
discuss money.

317
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:23,136
You're no stranger. -No.

318
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:24,403
You're a kin.

319
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:28,235
So, l'm sister, but.. -Let
it be. Let it be.

320
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:29,837
Sister, l'm not a stranger.

321
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:32,040
l'm a kin. -Okay.

322
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:34,111
Keep this down.

323
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:37,947
Sister, all that is fine, but..

324
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:41,786
Still, l..

325
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:43,122
What is it?

326
00:19:43,496 --> 00:19:45,760
Today l gave you a room to
stay you're asking for the rent.

327
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,359
Then you'll ask for the price
of the blanket and pillow.

328
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:51,158
Tomorrow, if we serve you food..

329
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:52,531
..you'll ask for its
price as well.

330
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:54,906
And then the day after that,
if l get you married..

331
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:56,601
..then you'll ask for my fee.

332
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:59,473
No, Sister. Don't worry
about my marriage.

333
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:02,939
Why? Are you married?

334
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,618
So, are you having
a love affair?

335
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,946
Oh, no, Sister.

336
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:12,123
l just don't want
to get married..

337
00:20:12,157 --> 00:20:15,752
..until l finish my engineering
and find a job.

338
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:19,159
You can study and look for
jobs all your life.

339
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:22,063
But that doesn't mean that
you shouldn't get married.

340
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:24,227
No, Sister. The house
can't be proper..

341
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,997
..until the foundation
isn't strong.

342
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:28,098
Engineer.

343
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:31,906
But l'm sure.

344
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:33,771
No matter how many
times you refuse..

345
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:37,006
..your family must be looking
for a girl for you.

346
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:38,648
l don't have a family, Sister.

347
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:42,346
All l'd was a mother, she
passed away last year.

348
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:44,419
Now there is just an uncle..

349
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:46,549
..and he's mired in many
problems himself.

350
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:48,785
Uncle Rajbali.

351
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:04,873
This is called 'Sashtang
(knock-out).'

352
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,912
Come on. Now, apologise
to everyone. -Everyone?

353
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:11,715
But we flirted with just one.

354
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:14,215
Why did you.. -Apologise
to everyone.

355
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,445
Forgive us.

356
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:16,714
l'll beat you.

357
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:22,683
Uncle. -Nephew.

358
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:26,193
Wait. Wait. Wait.

359
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:30,257
Son. Son. Son.

360
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:33,730
Uncle, what are you doing
in my college?

361
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:36,097
Those boys were flirting
with the girls.

362
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:40,511
So, l taught them a lesson.
-Yes, but why did you come here?

363
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,110
l've selected a girl for you.

364
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,178
You remember Mr. Kedarnath?

365
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:46,846
His daughter Janvi.

366
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,282
ls he your uncle? -No,
l'm his nephew.

367
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:52,717
She's as virtuous as her name.

368
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:54,317
lt's a very nice family.

369
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:55,825
They're the followers of Gandhi.

370
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,229
He's a true Vaishnava
(caste) who..

371
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:02,098
Uncle, you know l don't want
to get married now.

372
00:22:02,468 --> 00:22:03,799
They were saying the
same thing. -Who?

373
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:04,958
Shyam Sunder Kedarnath.

374
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,603
Shyam Sunder Kedarnath, who?

375
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:09,002
Uncle, who are you..
-Janvi's father.

376
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:09,767
Janvi's father.

377
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,907
ls he your uncle? -No,
l'm his nephew.

378
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:13,772
l went there to make
arrangements..

379
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,437
..for the village council
elections.

380
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:18,149
So, l made a bad impression
on him.

381
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:22,120
He thought l was a goon.

382
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:25,582
He said, l won't get my
daughter married..

383
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:27,114
..into a family of ruffians.

384
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:29,223
My blood boiled.

385
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,753
l hope you didn't do anything.
-What didn't l do?

386
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:34,596
l've made all the arrangements.

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,592
We'll abduct the girl tomorrow.

388
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:40,263
And get you two married. -That's
what l came here to tell you.

389
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:42,301
Uncle, what are you going to do?

390
00:22:42,374 --> 00:22:43,466
He's your uncle, isn't he?

391
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:45,304
Yes, he's. Everyone has one.

392
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:49,511
Uncle, you know l don't want
to get married right now.

393
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:51,146
And you want to abduct
the girl..

394
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:52,615
..and invite her
family's wrath..

395
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:54,948
That's the problem with
you educated people.

396
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,311
You think so much that
you can't do anything.

397
00:22:57,956 --> 00:22:59,048
Now, l'll have to leave.

398
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,255
l'll have to cancel
the arrangements..

399
00:23:01,393 --> 00:23:02,553
..l made for the kidnapping,

400
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:08,265
Shall l send some clarified
butter from the village?

401
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:11,358
l'll have it sent. -Fine.

402
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,032
Uncle.

403
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:17,006
Uncle.

404
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:18,804
Get the car. -Yes.

405
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,076
Come, sir.

406
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:25,338
He's your uncle?

407
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:31,613
Everyone travelling to
Jaunpur alight here.

408
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:33,749
We've reached Jaunpur.

409
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,922
Everyone travelling to
Jaunpur alight here.

410
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:56,940
lf you'd informed..

411
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,710
..l would've sent someone
to the bus-stand.

412
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,646
Oh, Mother..l would've
called Kashiram..

413
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:04,949
..then he would've informed
you when he'd time.

414
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:06,586
l would've have arrived by then.

415
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:08,989
But this time around, l'll
give you a cell-phone.

416
00:24:09,294 --> 00:24:11,694
So that we can talk whenever
we want. That's it.

417
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:13,794
And l've told him to
buy an inverter.

418
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:16,762
He'll send it next week. -You
look after us so well.

419
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:18,299
Me and Nisha.

420
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,194
You're my son, and not daughter.

421
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:22,866
No, Mother. l'm your daughter.

422
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:25,941
But daughters take more care.

423
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:29,977
lf people understand that
then lndia will reform.

424
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:33,215
Nisha talks like that. -Really?

425
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:35,044
But where is she?

426
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:36,985
She's gone for her classes.

427
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:39,221
To educate the wives
of the farmers.

428
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:48,730
l've selected a boy
for her, Mother.

429
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:51,028
He stays in our room upstairs.

430
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:52,427
He's studying engineering.

431
00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:55,233
He's handsome, and has enough
property and wealth..

432
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:57,302
..in the village.

433
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:00,635
So, if you feel it right..

434
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,808
What can l say?

435
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:04,442
lf you like it, then it's fine.

436
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:07,242
Okay then.

437
00:25:07,653 --> 00:25:09,211
l'll take Nisha with
me tomorrow.

438
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,980
And fix the alliance.

439
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,559
Nisha.

440
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:41,206
There's a boy staying
upstairs, Rahul..

441
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,813
He must he studying. Give
it to him as well.

442
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,429
Come in.

443
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:26,715
You're.. -Aarti (veneration
fire).

444
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:30,324
Aarti. Nice name.

445
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:37,635
l'm Rahul. -l know. Sister
just told me.

446
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:42,539
Oh, you're sister Rajeshwari's
sister. -Yes.

447
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:44,138
She arrived last night.

448
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:48,538
She's beautiful..l mean,
she sings beautifully.

449
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:52,378
She doesn't just sing,
she cooks well..

450
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:53,910
..takes care of the house..

451
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:55,913
..teaches the children
in the village.

452
00:27:56,221 --> 00:27:58,052
And she's doing B.A. -Okay.

453
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:00,081
And she's a topper in
her studies as well.

454
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:03,394
Hindi, History, Geography, she's
a topper in everything.

455
00:28:03,862 --> 00:28:05,557
But her English is slightly..

456
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:09,192
English has unnecessarily been
given such importance.

457
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:11,391
Otherwise, English isn't
that important.

458
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,494
That's fine.

459
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:16,107
But here, English is important
to pass B.A.

460
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:22,840
lf you don't have any problem..

461
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:27,208
..can you teach English
to my sister? -l..

462
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:30,686
Oh, no. l'm not forcing you.

463
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:32,423
You shouldn't feel that just
because we aren't..

464
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,459
..charging you rent, you've to
teach her. -Oh, no, Sister.

465
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:36,050
l'll surely teach her. l..

466
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:38,591
Mama. -Coming.

467
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:39,561
l'll be right back. -Yes.

468
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:49,039
But l hope it won't be
any problem to you.

469
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,371
Oh, no. l'll teach you
when l'm not studying,

470
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,540
No, l mean..

471
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:57,114
l mean.. -l get it.

472
00:29:04,756 --> 00:29:05,518
lt's okay.

473
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,193
There definitely is something.

474
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:15,231
Does he like Nisha?

475
00:29:16,902 --> 00:29:18,563
Our sister isn't a vegetable..

476
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:20,834
..that he'll select
her at one look.

477
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:23,104
lt'll take some time.

478
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:25,139
Time? -Yes.

479
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:30,674
Days or months? -What difference
does it make?

480
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:33,650
A loss of 1200 every month.

481
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:36,120
Two months mean 2400.

482
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,155
And three months mean.. -3600.

483
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,257
l too know the tables of 12.

484
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:41,955
Pass me that pen. -Move.

485
00:29:42,027 --> 00:29:43,255
That..

486
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,697
Let me do a Laxmi-Ganesh
and clear everything.

487
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:54,164
Lord Ganesh.

488
00:29:56,775 --> 00:30:00,609
Which means? -That means think
less about wealth..

489
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:03,081
..everything is going well.

490
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,512
Before l start teaching you..

491
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:09,143
..l should know how much l know.

492
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:12,015
Sister, give it to me. l..

493
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:15,586
Did that hurt? -Yes.

494
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:19,991
Where should l.. Sorry.

495
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:24,293
Sit down.

496
00:30:28,106 --> 00:30:29,573
Start. -Yes.

497
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:32,943
We should know how much
English you know.

498
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:36,445
So, what is your name? -Nisha.

499
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:38,041
l did tell you.

500
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:42,977
What are your subjects?

501
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:46,514
You're so forgetful.
Didn't l tell you?

502
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:49,223
Hindi, History, Geography
and English.

503
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:51,725
Tell him. -No, l..

504
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,425
Wanted her to speak in
English and know..

505
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:57,693
..how much does she know,
so.. -Oh, that way.

506
00:30:57,936 --> 00:30:59,665
She can speak fluently.

507
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:00,863
You can ask her whatever
you want.

508
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:03,298
Fine.

509
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,674
Now, translate whatever
l say. -Okay.

510
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,104
Shakespeare was a great writer.

511
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:13,651
Shakespeare was a great
writer. -Yes.

512
00:31:13,718 --> 00:31:14,742
Say it.

513
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:18,685
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

514
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:21,785
Where there's a will, there's
a way. Say it.

515
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:24,026
Birds are flying.

516
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:25,153
Birds are flying.

517
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:26,957
Clouds are coming.

518
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:28,032
Clouds are coming.

519
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,131
l'm going.

520
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:30,292
l'm going.

521
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:44,042
l'm..going. -Oh, no,
Sister. Please sit.

522
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:47,841
No, no. l should leave.

523
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,079
Okay, fine.

524
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:53,848
What is your name? -Nisha.

525
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,729
Hungama. -Cartoon.

526
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:00,856
Hungama. -Cartoon.

527
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:04,458
Sana.. -Not on my stomach, not
on my stomach. No.

528
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:05,560
Sana, Shlok.

529
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:06,797
Sana, quiet.

530
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,199
Why have you created a racket?

531
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,567
She snatched the remote.
-He hit me.

532
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:11,836
When did l hit you?

533
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,499
Quiet.

534
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:15,273
You two are creating
such a racket.

535
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,311
You know Rahul must be studying
at the moment.

536
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:18,640
He'll get disturbed.

537
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:21,110
He's studying engineering,
it's no joke.

538
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:23,653
You two don't seem to get it.
You need to use your brains.

539
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:24,877
One needs silence for it.

540
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:27,581
But you two have created
uproar in the house.

541
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,260
You're screaming more
than us, Aunt.

542
00:32:49,914 --> 00:32:51,905
There's no confusion,
it's very simple.

543
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:54,651
Solar eclipse is
a solar eclipse.

544
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:57,711
And a lunar eclipse is lunar
eclipse. lsn't it?

545
00:32:58,256 --> 00:32:59,780
When you don't see
the sun, that's..

546
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:04,725
..called solar eclipse. rt?

547
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,726
And when you don't see the moon?

548
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:10,924
Go ask brother Rahul
to teach you.

549
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:13,064
He's tutoring aunt very well.

550
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:14,298
l.. l.. -Go, go.

551
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:15,964
Yes, l'm free. l'm free.

552
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,732
You teach the best.

553
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,300
Why don't you teach him?

554
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:22,076
You talk such nonsense.

555
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:24,278
Rahul will explain to
him scientifically.

556
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:35,349
Tell me, what is the centre
of the universe? -Sun.

557
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:36,724
Very good.

558
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:40,227
lmagine that l'm the sun, so,
what does the earth do?

559
00:33:40,498 --> 00:33:43,365
The earth rotates around
the sun. -Correct.

560
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:48,530
Now imagine that your
aunt Nisha..

561
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:51,733
lmagine it, Nisha.

562
00:33:56,314 --> 00:34:01,115
lmagine that your aunt
Nisha is the earth.

563
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:04,686
Now, tell her what
she has to do.

564
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:09,221
Aunt Nisha, rotate
around the sun.

565
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:13,596
lf you go around, it'll be
easier for Shlok to understand.

566
00:34:19,404 --> 00:34:25,400
So, Shlok, remember..the earth
always rotates this way.

567
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:49,734
When will the solar eclipse
occur? -Never.

568
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:54,728
Then what'll l write for
my homework. -Anything.

569
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:59,103
Oh, yes, homework.

570
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:07,514
Yes, now, tell me who rotates
around the earth. -Moon.

571
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:12,587
Correct. -Now, mummy
is the moon.

572
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:15,992
Now, everyone rotate
around. -Yes.

573
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:18,389
So, while rotating..

574
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:21,391
..the moon comes in-between
the earth and the sun.

575
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:26,199
The earth cannot see the sun.

576
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:30,072
lt seems like the sun has
strayed far away from earth.

577
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:36,379
The earth is scared, it's
gripped with darkness.

578
00:35:36,981 --> 00:35:39,609
The time when sun disappears..

579
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,483
..is called the solar eclipse.

580
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,311
But the sun hasn't disappeared.

581
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:47,152
lt's waiting for the
moon to move away..

582
00:35:47,992 --> 00:35:50,552
..so that it can shed his
ray of love on earth.

583
00:35:53,064 --> 00:35:57,057
And earth smiles once
again to see its sun.

584
00:36:07,378 --> 00:36:11,405
l..homework.. -Do your homework.

585
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:15,419
Let's go, Shlok.

586
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:19,512
Not from between the
earth and the sun.

587
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:51,879
Why is my heart making
me restless?

588
00:36:52,724 --> 00:36:59,755
Why is it yearning
for someone?

589
00:37:00,565 --> 00:37:06,868
lt desires those moments
of happiness again.

590
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:16,140
lt has fallen in love
with someone.

591
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:21,909
What's wrong with the heart?

592
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:47,169
lt desires those bangle-adorned
hands again.

593
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:54,648
Wishes someone to talk
to him for hours.

594
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:02,856
lt desires those feelings
at night again.

595
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:10,262
lt wishes to feel those
delicate lips again.

596
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:18,869
lt desires someone to stay
in the arms all night.

597
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:25,878
lt desires a sweet encounter
once again.

598
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:29,716
An encounter.

599
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:37,318
Why does it have
so many desires?

600
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:45,159
Why does it mention
only your name?

601
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:52,142
lt desires someone's
love once again.

602
00:38:52,810 --> 00:39:00,717
lt's expressing desires
once again.

603
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:08,555
Why is my heart making
me restless?

604
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:16,896
Why is it yearning
for someone?

605
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:23,334
lt desires those moments
of happiness again.

606
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:32,074
lt has fallen in love
with someone.

607
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:38,316
What's wrong with the heart?

608
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:54,065
What's wrong with the heart?

609
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:06,907
Did you fall asleep
while studying?

610
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:08,076
Or are you studying
while sleeping.

611
00:40:10,755 --> 00:40:12,154
l didn't realise when
l fell asleep.

612
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,117
l was watching a
beautiful dream.

613
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,891
l'll show you what beauty is.

614
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:19,257
Come.

615
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:21,732
No, Brother. l'll sit with aunt.

616
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:23,126
No, l want to sit
with aunt Nisha.

617
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:25,299
You can't sit with her. -No
Today, l'll sit with her.

618
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:27,098
Shlok, Sana. You'll fall
down. -Sit down.

619
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:28,433
lsn't she looking gorgeous?

620
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:33,408
Can any boy refuse to
marry her today?

621
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:37,311
No boy can ever refuse
to marry Nisha.

622
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:38,143
Rajeshwari.

623
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:40,345
We expect the same.

624
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:46,049
Tell me. -Yes.

625
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:48,455
When the ration arrives, have
it kept in place. -Okay.

626
00:40:48,593 --> 00:40:51,118
We're taking Nisha to the
doctor. -Doctor? Why?

627
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:52,589
Nisha was looking fine.

628
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:54,589
ln fact, she was looking
very nice.

629
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:56,124
That's why we're taking her.

630
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:57,526
To talk about her alliance.

631
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:08,070
Tell me is the MD greater
or MBBS? -MD.

632
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:10,246
Yes. The boy is studying
for that.

633
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:17,183
Wear that. -Shlok, you wear it
too. -Like this, isn't it?

634
00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:18,646
Yes. Like that.

635
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:28,660
What ruse have you plotted
now, madam?

636
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:32,966
lf you want Rahul to marry her..

637
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:34,463
..then why did you tell him..

638
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:36,095
We're fixing her alliance
with a doctor?

639
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:41,210
At times, you've to use crooked
means for fair end.

640
00:41:45,183 --> 00:41:47,174
And only a person who
handles the kitchen..

641
00:41:47,718 --> 00:41:48,946
..can know that.

642
00:41:50,054 --> 00:41:52,181
There's another truth that..

643
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:55,490
..men can never understand
women.

644
00:41:56,427 --> 00:41:57,951
lt would've been so much fun..

645
00:41:58,029 --> 00:41:59,189
..if uncle Rahul had
come along too.

646
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:00,127
lsn't it, Aunt?

647
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:04,496
lt'll be much more fun if
Rahul doesn't come along.

648
00:42:05,436 --> 00:42:06,494
What do you mean,
Brother-in-law?

649
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:13,742
He means, if Rahul doesn't
waste his time around..

650
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:15,543
..and tops his engineering
exam..

651
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,411
..that'll be much
better, isn't it?

652
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:25,488
Nisha, what do you
think of Rahul?

653
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:30,059
Just like you do, Sister.

654
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:33,195
l like him a lot.

655
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:35,465
So, do you?

656
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:43,663
The main course hasn't
been served yet.

657
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:45,201
And the dessert too.

658
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,498
Aunt Nisha..

659
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:19,403
Carefully, Sana.

660
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:20,799
You all are back.

661
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:22,805
You'll were late, isn't it?

662
00:43:24,382 --> 00:43:28,182
Nisha, Sana, Shlok. Go
change your clothes.

663
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:33,146
lt's so hot.

664
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:37,390
Sister. -Rahul, has
the ration arrived?

665
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:39,161
Yes, Sister. lt has been
delivered. -Okay.

666
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:43,362
You're sweating so much. -No.
Actually, while studying..

667
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:44,759
What happened, Sister?

668
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,169
lt's just as l'd expected.

669
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:51,966
That's why we got late.

670
00:43:54,612 --> 00:43:56,876
Get me a glass of water.
l'm feeling thirsty.

671
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:58,272
Yes, Sister. l..

672
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,279
Sister.

673
00:44:24,842 --> 00:44:27,367
Sana's book is in your room.

674
00:44:31,382 --> 00:44:35,819
Sister, what did the doctor
say? -Operation successful.

675
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:36,982
What?

676
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:39,554
That's what the doctors say..

677
00:44:39,824 --> 00:44:41,155
..when they're successful,
don't they?

678
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:44,457
So..Nisha's and the doctor's
alliance has been fixed, right?

679
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:49,426
That means..he has said
yes. -lnstantly.

680
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:52,428
Just like you did
before we left.

681
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:58,673
The truth is..l wanted
Nisha to marry you.

682
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:03,504
But that doctor turned out to
be more sensible than you.

683
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:05,246
How's that?

684
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:09,480
He didn't say, First education
and then marriage.

685
00:45:10,388 --> 00:45:11,685
He said Sister..

686
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,152
..if l fail in the examination,
l can reappear.

687
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:19,588
But if l lose a beautiful
girl..

688
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:22,157
lt's out.

689
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:25,596
The bangle is loose.

690
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:29,963
l'll just give Sana and Shlok
their book.. -Sister.

691
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:33,175
l was thinking. -lf
you were thinking.

692
00:45:33,677 --> 00:45:34,803
Continue to think.

693
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:37,679
As it's, you've more
brains to think.

694
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,006
Sister, my mother used to..

695
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:43,610
When you start building bridge
from both sides of the sea..

696
00:45:43,988 --> 00:45:48,857
..you should make sure that
they meet at a point..

697
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:50,193
..otherwise, it's useless.

698
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:56,190
Your mother was an engineer
too? -Yes. No..l mean..

699
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:59,828
..my mother would say, lf
you respect your elders..

700
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:01,428
..always listen to
their advice.

701
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,073
And l respect you
the most, Sister.

702
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,207
So, l'm ready to marry Nisha.

703
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:22,324
Really? -Absolutely, Sister.

704
00:46:23,427 --> 00:46:28,421
But that doctor.. -Yes, Doctor..

705
00:46:35,606 --> 00:46:37,597
l've a way to get rid
of the doctor.

706
00:46:40,544 --> 00:46:47,712
So, Sister..is it final? -Final.

707
00:47:09,206 --> 00:47:11,197
The heart wants to rejoice.

708
00:47:11,408 --> 00:47:13,399
Wants to create uproar.

709
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:15,568

00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:18,475

your marriage.

711
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:24,351
The heart wants to rejoice.

Wants to create uproar.

713
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:28,715

00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:33,953
Everyone will talk about me.

716
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:35,961
Everyone will talk about me.

717
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:38,226
The day l..

718
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:44,431
The day l get married, l
wonder what'll happen.

719
00:47:44,742 --> 00:47:49,679
The day l get married, l
wonder what'll happen.

720
00:47:57,955 --> 00:47:59,980
Few flowers and a
small garland.

721
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:02,287
Ward off all the jinxes.

722
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:04,156
All the guests have arrived.

723
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:05,751
They've arrived.

724
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:08,565
lroned traditional shirt,
polished shoes.

725
00:48:08,632 --> 00:48:10,998
l look like a handsome groom.

726
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:14,435
l've arranged for the horses
and the elephants.

727
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:17,604
How long do l control myself?

728
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:19,870
The heart's getting restless.

729
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,773
Everyone will be
present there.

730
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:24,075
The day l..

731
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:30,482
The day l get married, l
wonder what'll happen.

732
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:36,015
The day l get married, l
wonder what'll happen.

733
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:50,070
She's here, she's there.

734
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,335
Whether it's on land
or in the sky..

735
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:56,209
l see her face everyone.

736
00:48:56,547 --> 00:48:58,742
l would've brought
her home today.

737
00:48:58,816 --> 00:49:01,148
Crowned her as my queen.

738
00:49:01,252 --> 00:49:04,847
But look for an auspicious
date.

739
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:14,262
The day l..

740
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,461
The day l get married, l
wonder what'll happen.

741
00:49:20,804 --> 00:49:26,037
The day l get married, l
wonder what'll happen.

742
00:49:28,812 --> 00:49:30,871
The heart wants to rejoice.

743
00:49:30,981 --> 00:49:33,074
Wants to create uproar.

744
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,208
Happiness has returned
to my life.

745
00:49:35,386 --> 00:49:38,219
Run around announcing
my marriage.

746
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:40,355
Everyone will talk about me.

747
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:42,354
Everyone will talk about me.

748
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:44,721
The day l..

749
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:51,200
The day l get married, l
wonder what'll happen.

750
00:49:51,435 --> 00:49:56,236
The day l get married, l
wonder what'll happen.

751
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:05,714
Yes, Mother.

752
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,683
Yes, we've begun the
preparations.

753
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:10,010
Yes.

754
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:13,613
Yes. Rahul is preparing as well.

755
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,287
Yes, we've fixed an auspicious
day a few days from now.

756
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:21,087
Mother, tell Nisha..

757
00:50:21,198 --> 00:50:23,530
..that we've bought her bridal
wear of her choice.

758
00:50:24,368 --> 00:50:25,426
Yes, don't worry.

759
00:50:26,537 --> 00:50:27,265
Yes.

760
00:50:27,638 --> 00:50:29,162
Yes, he has taken leave.

761
00:50:29,907 --> 00:50:30,737
For 15 days.

762
00:50:31,775 --> 00:50:32,605
Yes.

763
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:34,437
Yes, Mother. Everything is fine.

764
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:35,608
l'll hang up now.

765
00:50:36,213 --> 00:50:39,239
Are you Mrs. Saxena? -Yes.

766
00:50:40,617 --> 00:50:41,641
l'm Yuvraaj Saxena.

767
00:50:41,919 --> 00:50:43,614
l've just joined Godrej
as the junior..

768
00:50:43,954 --> 00:50:45,512
Please leave, l don't
want to buy anything.

769
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:47,718
Oh, no. You're misunderstanding
me.

770
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:49,756
No, l'm absolutely right.

771
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:53,988
These big companies dress up
good looking boys and girls..

772
00:50:54,064 --> 00:50:56,123
..and send them as
their salesman.

773
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:57,459
l'm not a salesman.

774
00:50:57,668 --> 00:51:00,535
l've been appointed as the
Junior Manager in Godrej. -So?

775
00:51:01,972 --> 00:51:03,405
Why have you parked
the car here?

776
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:04,701
Take it out.

777
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:06,400
Your husband's uncle
has sent me.

778
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,408
Uncle Gajendra.

779
00:51:08,879 --> 00:51:10,244
Take your car out
quickly. Quickly.

780
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:13,181
He said that you've a room.

781
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,444
l mean l can rent it out.

782
00:51:15,219 --> 00:51:16,880
There was, l don't
have it anymore.

783
00:51:18,689 --> 00:51:21,624
Actually, the mess' food
doesn't suit me.

784
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:24,826
l wanted a room for
just two months.

785
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:26,856
Actually, the factory's
bungalow..

786
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,990
..will be ready in 2 months.
So, l can appoint a cook then.

787
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:36,939
And your family.. -l'm
still a bachelor.

788
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:47,976
You're the Junior Manager
in Godrej. -Yes.

789
00:51:49,853 --> 00:51:51,844
Fixed job. -Yes.

790
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:56,391
And you're going to get a
bungalow after two months. -Yes.

791
00:51:57,194 --> 00:51:59,185
ls that car yours? -Yes.

792
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:02,789
And you're a Saxena? -Yes.

793
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:04,299
Come on then.

794
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:13,902
You'll have to take one sweet.

795
00:52:14,578 --> 00:52:16,409
lt's an offering. -Okay.

796
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:21,411
So, why are you still
a bachelor?

797
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:23,108
Mummy is looking for a bride.

798
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:24,911
When she finds one,
l'll get married.

799
00:52:25,422 --> 00:52:27,822
On that note, have one more.

800
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:30,159
l just had this. -This one.

801
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:31,988
That's an offering as well.

802
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,554
Come.

803
00:52:35,766 --> 00:52:40,499
l was thinking, uncle Gajendra
has sent you here..

804
00:52:40,938 --> 00:52:42,963
..so, it's our duty to help you.

805
00:52:43,507 --> 00:52:44,804
Sit down, sit down.

806
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:46,673
So, l suggest that..you
adjust yourself..

807
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:48,769
..in the mess for two days.

808
00:52:49,313 --> 00:52:52,180
After that, we'll adjust
you in our house.

809
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:53,405
Thank you, Sister.

810
00:52:57,721 --> 00:53:00,189
These days, people hesitate to
rent their room to bachelors.

811
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:01,817
lf it wasn't for you..

812
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:03,823
-l'm helping you because
you're a bachelor.

813
00:53:04,728 --> 00:53:06,821
What? -l mean, anyone
would've easily..

814
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:09,756
..helped you'd you been married.

815
00:53:10,033 --> 00:53:11,830
You wouldn't need our
help then, isn't it?

816
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:13,695
You're right.

817
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:15,761
Only kin help in times of need.

818
00:53:17,107 --> 00:53:18,540
That's humanity.

819
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,177
Today, we've helped you.

820
00:53:22,412 --> 00:53:24,209
Tomorrow, you might be
of some help to us.

821
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,455
Sister.

822
00:53:35,626 --> 00:53:38,060
Sister, l need to finalise
from these two cards.

823
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:39,693
This blue one or..

824
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:44,292
ls..everything fine, Sister?

825
00:53:44,968 --> 00:53:46,731
You look worried.

826
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:49,701
You aren't an engineer,
but a doctor.

827
00:53:50,741 --> 00:53:51,708
You've guessed it right.

828
00:53:52,075 --> 00:53:53,064
What's wrong?

829
00:53:53,443 --> 00:53:55,343
l wouldn't mind if just
one person said it.

830
00:53:56,113 --> 00:53:59,048
But the entire neighbourhood
is talking about you.

831
00:53:59,116 --> 00:54:00,174
And l can't endure it.

832
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:02,909
Sister, tell me clearly..

833
00:54:05,122 --> 00:54:06,783
Mrs. Rai and Mrs. Sharma..

834
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:10,051
..say that you've become
a live-in son-in-law.

835
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:13,989
Now, l can't charge you rent
just to prove them wrong.

836
00:54:14,398 --> 00:54:15,660
So, they're right.

837
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:18,896
They don't see what their
children are doing.

838
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:20,834
lnstead, they pry on others.

839
00:54:21,705 --> 00:54:23,002
You know Mrs. Rai's daughter..

840
00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:24,973
What do we care about
what they do?

841
00:54:25,342 --> 00:54:27,276
But l couldn't endure
your defamation.

842
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:29,470
So, l just told them that
you don't stay here.

843
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:32,606
You did the right thing.

844
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:35,711
That's the end of the issue.
-That isn't the end.

845
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:37,586
They're coming here to
see it themselves.

846
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:39,613
And you know Mrs. Rai.

847
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:48,622
Mrs. Rai.. -No, Sister,
you..don't worry.

848
00:54:48,899 --> 00:54:52,767
l'll make some other
arrangements for myself.

849
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:56,296
Okay.

850
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:00,502
But Rahul.. -Yes.

851
00:55:00,978 --> 00:55:03,003
Where will you go at
such a short notice?

852
00:55:03,981 --> 00:55:06,575
l'll..go stay with Shaukat.

853
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:07,582
He's my friend.

854
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:09,777
You'll stay with a
betel-leaf seller.

855
00:55:10,287 --> 00:55:11,982
That isn't right,
then Mrs. Rai..

856
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:14,922
Don't worry, l won't tell
anyone anything.

857
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:17,187
As you wish.

858
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:20,388
They'll be here by 10 o'clock.

859
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,731
Fine, Sister. l'll
leave by 9:30.

860
00:55:32,676 --> 00:55:34,143
Look, l'm telling you again.

861
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:37,243
What you're doing isn't right.

862
00:55:37,948 --> 00:55:40,041
And what if Laxmi-Ganesh
say it's right?

863
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:41,443
Laxmi-Ganesh..

864
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:57,765
Last time, Lord Ganesh gave
the green signal for Rahul.

865
00:55:58,101 --> 00:55:59,568
Yes, so, he was the
right choice then.

866
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:03,028
Now, let's see what Lord
Ganesh says for Yuvraaj.

867
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:06,976
Laxmi.

868
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:08,643
l knew it will be Laxmi.

869
00:56:09,212 --> 00:56:13,080
That means wealthy Yuvraaj
will keep our Nisha happy.

870
00:56:17,621 --> 00:56:20,590
Rajeshwari, can l ask
you something?

871
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:25,151
What if tomorrow..we
find a better..

872
00:56:26,296 --> 00:56:28,890
..and wealthier boy
than Yuvraaj?

873
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:31,728
Then we'll get Nisha
married to him.

874
00:56:32,936 --> 00:56:35,063
Look, our responsibility
is to see..

875
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:36,403
..that the boy is nice.

876
00:56:37,174 --> 00:56:41,338
lf he's wealthy, Nisha
will be happier.

877
00:56:43,513 --> 00:56:45,606
And l'll fulfil my
responsibility at any cost.

878
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,312
Don't keep calling me all day?

879
00:56:51,755 --> 00:56:53,279
Otherwise, we'll keep discussing
the same topic.

880
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:55,288
Good morning, Sister.

881
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:58,520
Yuvraaj is here, and Rahul
is still upstairs.

882
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:00,694
What now? -We'll lose both
the boys. What else?

883
00:57:00,797 --> 00:57:01,821
No, no. Don't do that.

884
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:04,432
You'll have to help me. -Not at
all, l'm going to the office.

885
00:57:04,568 --> 00:57:05,899
You're under my oath. -What?

886
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:08,730
Yes, you'll have to
help me in this.

887
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:09,669
l don't know anything.

888
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:11,132
You're under my oath.

889
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:16,074
Yuvraaj why did you
come so early?

890
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:20,841
You arrived so early,
isn't it? -Yes.

891
00:57:21,585 --> 00:57:22,882
You asked me to come.

892
00:57:23,186 --> 00:57:25,245
So, l thought l'll shift before
l leave for office.

893
00:57:25,789 --> 00:57:26,813
You did the right thing.

894
00:57:27,257 --> 00:57:28,121
You did the right thing.

895
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:29,824
Yuvraaj, this is Surinder.

896
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:32,224
Uncle Gajendra's nephew. -Hello.

897
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:34,524
And this is Yuvraaj,
our new tenant.

898
00:57:35,098 --> 00:57:36,998
l'll shift my luggage
quickly. -Why?

899
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:40,535
Why quickly? Do it slowly.

900
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:43,895
lf there's something delicate
like glass or porcelain..

901
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:45,005
..it might break.

902
00:57:45,408 --> 00:57:46,238
Do it slowly.

903
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:48,276
Help him in getting the luggage.

904
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:50,172
l.. -Slowly.

905
00:58:02,259 --> 00:58:05,057
Get up. This isn't
the time to sleep.

906
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:07,488
Get up. Get up, they're here.

907
00:58:08,098 --> 00:58:11,226
ls that all the luggage you've?
-Yes, that's it.

908
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:12,393
Okay.

909
00:58:13,136 --> 00:58:14,933
Slowly, what's the hurry?

910
00:58:18,275 --> 00:58:20,607
Listen, listen. -Not that way,
go out from the rear exit.

911
00:58:20,677 --> 00:58:21,837
Okay, fine.

912
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:23,170
Hey. -What?

913
00:58:23,246 --> 00:58:24,440
My luggage. My luggage.

914
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:26,481
No. Stand beneath the window..

915
00:58:26,616 --> 00:58:28,049
..l'll throw it down. -Okay.

916
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:29,149
Don't forget.

917
00:58:30,187 --> 00:58:32,348
Can l help?

918
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:35,819
What's the hurry? There must
be expensive stuff inside.

919
00:58:35,926 --> 00:58:39,623
lt might break. Be
careful. Careful.

920
00:58:49,072 --> 00:58:52,599
Brother. Slowly, you might slip.

921
00:58:53,176 --> 00:58:54,438
Carefully.

922
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:13,794
Car. -Car?

923
00:59:14,064 --> 00:59:15,759
Ancestral car. -Oh.

924
00:59:15,832 --> 00:59:17,129
lt's my car. -Really?

925
00:59:18,668 --> 00:59:19,999
lt runs really nice. -Really?

926
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:21,864
But.. -Slowly, isn't it?

927
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:23,030
Yes.

928
00:59:23,974 --> 00:59:26,272
lt's small but.. -Runs slowly.

929
00:59:26,643 --> 00:59:27,405
Not bad.

930
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:31,576
l don't even need to send
it to the garage. -Why?

931
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:33,171
Because it just lies
here. -l see.

932
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:40,019
Now, you take care, l'm leaving.

933
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,384
Yes. -Go carefully.

934
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:44,189
Yujraaj, come in.

935
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,619
lt's a very nice room.

936
01:00:12,322 --> 01:00:14,654
You can see the rising sun
from here in the morning.

937
01:00:15,325 --> 01:00:17,225
And you wake up to the
chirping of the birds.

938
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:19,958
Come here, take a look.

939
01:00:21,531 --> 01:00:23,999
And if you look out the window,
you'll see greenery.

940
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:26,193
You'll be able to concentrate
on your studies..

941
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,904
l mean you'll be able to
concentrate on your work..

942
01:00:29,205 --> 01:00:30,399
..and reach the top.

943
01:00:48,258 --> 01:00:51,022
We don't have any cockroaches
or lizards.

944
01:00:51,494 --> 01:00:52,426
l don't let them in.

945
01:00:53,763 --> 01:00:55,526
l think they're scared
of you, isn't it?

946
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,531
You're very funny.

947
01:00:59,235 --> 01:01:00,964
We'll enjoy your company,
Yuvraaj.

948
01:01:03,806 --> 01:01:07,902
And listen, have tea, breakfast
and lunch with us.

949
01:01:08,511 --> 01:01:10,001
Feel at home, okay?

950
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,276
Of course. ln fact, uncle
Gajendra said the same thing.

951
01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:19,918
lf you don't mind, can
l ask you something?

952
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:23,350
lf l don't mind you'll
ask me only one thing.

953
01:01:24,027 --> 01:01:25,927
And how many questions will
you ask if l do mind.

954
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,361
You really are very funny.

955
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:36,229
But l wanted to ask..you're so..
What is it called in English?

956
01:01:36,339 --> 01:01:38,466
Handsome. Good-looking.

957
01:01:39,008 --> 01:01:40,407
You look just like an actor.

958
01:01:41,444 --> 01:01:43,105
Then didn't you think of trying
your luck in films?

959
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,406
Films are all fake.

960
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:47,047
They're an illusion, a delusion.

961
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:49,579
We belong to the family
of freedom fighters.

962
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,285
We're the followers of Gandhiji.

963
01:01:55,124 --> 01:01:58,184
Mummy says, Simple living,
high thinking.

964
01:01:59,095 --> 01:02:01,029
What high thinking you've!
-They're Gandhiji's.

965
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:04,463
What a high family you belong
to? -lt's my ancestors.

966
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:10,230
What a handsome photograph
you've?

967
01:02:10,974 --> 01:02:12,032
Mummy clicked this one.

968
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:14,771
Actually, she clicked
three photographs..

969
01:02:14,978 --> 01:02:16,809
..but mummy says, This
looks the best.

970
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,615
lt's your face, isn't it? -Yes.

971
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:21,440
Even the job. -Yes.

972
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:23,812
You'll be getting the
bungalow. -Yes.

973
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,610
And you'll get married.
-Yes, l'll.

974
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:27,449
But only with mummy's
permission.

975
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:32,425
Wow, Rajeshwari.

976
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:36,557
You thought of your uncle
Gajendra after a long time.

977
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:38,766
We remember you everyday, Uncle.

978
01:02:39,535 --> 01:02:40,763
We just called you today.

979
01:02:41,471 --> 01:02:43,962
Actually we wanted to see
you and Yuvraaj's mother.

980
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:47,209
Yes. Pick up the phone.

981
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:50,875
Hello.

982
01:02:52,515 --> 01:02:54,983
Hello, Mother. -Mother
has called.

983
01:02:56,386 --> 01:02:58,081
How did Yuvraaj's
mother call you?

984
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:00,947
She's talking on the phone.

985
01:03:01,391 --> 01:03:04,758
But..you're talking
on the phone, son.

986
01:03:05,094 --> 01:03:08,825
Yes, but she.. -Yes,
talk to your nephew.

987
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:11,125
Just a minute. -Talk to him.
-What will l say? -Talk to him.

988
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,565
l.. -Talk to him.

989
01:03:14,203 --> 01:03:15,363
Hello. -Hello.

990
01:03:15,438 --> 01:03:17,167
l can't hear you clearly. -Okay.

991
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,936
Hello, hello, hello.
-Yes, hello.

992
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:21,432
Hello. Hello.

993
01:03:21,511 --> 01:03:23,706
Mother, l..Mother..

994
01:03:24,514 --> 01:03:26,141
We wanted to talk about
Nisha's marriage.

995
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:30,211
Listen, please talk
to him. -With me.

996
01:03:30,453 --> 01:03:31,545
You talk to him.

997
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:34,988
But you're already married
to Rajeshwari, son.

998
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:39,720
That's right, Mother. But
now, she wants Yuvraaj.

999
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:42,128
What? She's gone crazy.

1000
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:43,523
Disconnect it, l'll
call her again.

1001
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:46,462
Come here. -Just a minute.

1002
01:03:47,904 --> 01:03:50,600
Mother..l'll talk to mother,
you talk to uncle. -Yes.

1003
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:52,837
And the network is very weak,
hold it right here. -Yes.

1004
01:03:53,443 --> 01:03:55,673
Hello. -Hello, hello.

1005
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:57,637
Hello.. -Hello, Mother.

1006
01:03:57,914 --> 01:03:58,903
What am l'm hearing?

1007
01:03:59,549 --> 01:04:03,508
You want to marry some
Yuvraaj? -Yes, Mother.

1008
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,080
He's a very nice boy.

1009
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:06,882
Exactly like l wanted.

1010
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:09,891
Then..what's wrong
with Surinder?

1011
01:04:10,827 --> 01:04:14,228
Mother..this isn't the time
to discuss his drawbacks.

1012
01:04:14,564 --> 01:04:15,724
Let him be as he's.

1013
01:04:16,566 --> 01:04:18,830
Just send Nisha here
as soon as you can.

1014
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:20,903
And yes, listen..don't
tell her anything.

1015
01:04:22,004 --> 01:04:24,871
Why shouldn't l? -She
might not be ready?

1016
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,608
l'm not ready for it as well.

1017
01:04:28,544 --> 01:04:29,203
Why, Mother?

1018
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:31,872
Because l can't send
the younger sister..

1019
01:04:31,948 --> 01:04:33,575
..to be the other woman in her
elder sister's marriage.

1020
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:41,548
What's wrong with mother?

1021
01:04:47,029 --> 01:04:49,054
l never seen mummy
so angry before.

1022
01:04:49,332 --> 01:04:50,264
And that too with you?

1023
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:51,958
lt's a new cell-phone.

1024
01:04:52,401 --> 01:04:53,891
She must've heard it
wrong. -Really?

1025
01:04:54,137 --> 01:04:56,469
That's why, she calmed down..

1026
01:04:56,572 --> 01:04:58,472
..only when brother-in-law
called.

1027
01:04:58,775 --> 01:05:00,572
l asked her, What was wrong?

1028
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:02,634
She said Nothing, it was
just a misconception.

1029
01:05:02,745 --> 01:05:05,714
And said Pack your bags and
go to Rajjo's house.

1030
01:05:05,815 --> 01:05:07,214
But what happened, Sister?

1031
01:05:08,284 --> 01:05:09,512
Nisha, the children's
bus must've arrived.

1032
01:05:09,652 --> 01:05:10,949
l'll go pick them up.

1033
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:12,787
Freshen up until then.

1034
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:26,225
Yes, that's fine.

1035
01:05:29,972 --> 01:05:31,439
My hand..

1036
01:05:43,753 --> 01:05:45,744
Did you get hurt?

1037
01:06:10,346 --> 01:06:14,510
Sorry, l thought it
was Rahul. -What?

1038
01:06:15,885 --> 01:06:18,479
Sorry. -What?

1039
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:25,687
Sorry. -Sorry.

1040
01:06:26,929 --> 01:06:28,897
What? -You..

1041
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:32,425
Hello.

1042
01:06:32,935 --> 01:06:36,871
Listen. Sorry. -Okay.

1043
01:06:40,443 --> 01:06:42,206
Sorry. -What?

1044
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:12,839
l only look at you
whenever we meet.

1045
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:23,808
My heart feels relaxed
when l talk to you.

1046
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:30,354
You dwell in me.

1047
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:35,496
You're the only one for me.

1048
01:07:36,232 --> 01:07:39,827
Come fall in love with me.

1049
01:07:40,603 --> 01:07:43,936
Come fall in love with me.

1050
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:48,742
l love only you.

1051
01:07:49,145 --> 01:07:51,136
Come fall in love with me.

1052
01:07:51,847 --> 01:07:55,442
Come fall in love with me.

1053
01:07:55,952 --> 01:08:00,651
You're the relief to my heart.

1054
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:35,080
When you're not with me..

1055
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:43,027
Life seems so full of despair.

1056
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:54,305
Darkness grips me in
broad daylight.

1057
01:08:55,311 --> 01:09:04,811
My heart says to you..l
belong to you.

1058
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:10,353
Come fall in love with me.

1059
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,491
Come fall in love with me.

1060
01:09:15,097 --> 01:09:18,897
l love only you.

1061
01:09:19,268 --> 01:09:21,828
Come fall in love with me.

1062
01:09:22,038 --> 01:09:25,872
Come fall in love with me.

1063
01:09:26,308 --> 01:09:30,836
You're the relief to my heart.

1064
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,425
People like to gossip.

1065
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:47,686
But when Rahul heard that
the neighbours..

1066
01:09:48,164 --> 01:09:50,098
..are calling him a live-in
son-in-law..

1067
01:09:50,666 --> 01:09:52,861
..he shifted to another
house instantly.

1068
01:09:53,069 --> 01:09:54,195
Rahul is like that.

1069
01:09:54,537 --> 01:09:56,971
l thought the boy living
upstairs is his friend.

1070
01:09:57,406 --> 01:09:59,897
No, no. That's Yuvraaj. Yuvi.

1071
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:02,271
Remember your brother-in-law's
uncle Gajendra?

1072
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:03,939
His friend's son.

1073
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:05,905
He works in Godrej.

1074
01:10:06,282 --> 01:10:07,442
He has a fixed job.

1075
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:09,875
And next month, he'll
get a bungalow.

1076
01:10:10,252 --> 01:10:11,879
But where did Rahul go?

1077
01:10:35,144 --> 01:10:38,079
What happened? -Sister, l can't
get him on the phone.

1078
01:10:38,147 --> 01:10:39,444
l don't know why it's showing
as unavailable.

1079
01:10:39,548 --> 01:10:42,779
You try it. -Okay,
you can try later.

1080
01:10:43,419 --> 01:10:44,909
Uncle Gajendra and Yuvi's
mother are coming over..

1081
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,214
..for dinner tonight.

1082
01:10:46,322 --> 01:10:48,620
Let's prepare for that. -Okay.

1083
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:49,756
Come on.

1084
01:10:53,662 --> 01:10:54,890
What happened?

1085
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:57,422
Did you finish the balance
in your cell-phone..

1086
01:10:57,466 --> 01:10:58,694
..talking to sister-in-law?

1087
01:10:59,101 --> 01:11:02,036
Not just Nisha, l can't even
talk to sister Rajeshwari.

1088
01:11:02,338 --> 01:11:04,203
l can't get through to
this number. -Why?

1089
01:11:04,273 --> 01:11:06,935
Have you been cut-off?

1090
01:11:07,476 --> 01:11:09,842
l'm not like your betel-leaves
to be cut-off.

1091
01:11:11,447 --> 01:11:13,381
lt's because of these
cell-phone companies.

1092
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:16,348
They make such big promises..
and when we try to call someone..

1093
01:11:16,452 --> 01:11:18,886
..either the network is missing,
or the.. -l got through.

1094
01:11:19,155 --> 01:11:20,019
Hello.

1095
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:21,248
Wrong number.

1096
01:11:23,225 --> 01:11:25,159
Thank God, we don't have to
pay for incoming calls.

1097
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:26,654
Otherwise we would've
been flat broke..

1098
01:11:26,762 --> 01:11:28,730
..paying for wrong numbers.

1099
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:30,859
Wow.

1100
01:11:33,802 --> 01:11:35,201
Sit down. -You sit down, sister.

1101
01:11:35,304 --> 01:11:37,534
Sit down, Nisha. Come on.

1102
01:11:38,374 --> 01:11:39,398
Have some.

1103
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:47,206
Dear, what've you prepared?

1104
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:51,077
Nisha has prepared
everything, Aunt.

1105
01:11:51,654 --> 01:11:52,484
Whenever she comes here..

1106
01:11:52,821 --> 01:11:54,152
..she doesn't let
us do any work.

1107
01:11:57,092 --> 01:12:00,289
But no one could cook as
good as Rajeshwari..

1108
01:12:00,496 --> 01:12:01,895
..and no one can.

1109
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:05,727
But it isn't right for a woman..

1110
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:08,464
..to be engrossed with
cooking and cleaning.

1111
01:12:09,071 --> 01:12:12,063
lsn't it? -Yes, Aunt.

1112
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:14,471
Sister Rajeshwari says
the same thing.

1113
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:17,240
That's why l teach
at the village.

1114
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:20,014
The children, as well as elders.

1115
01:12:22,918 --> 01:12:27,014
What are your hobbies?
-Learning, teaching..

1116
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:28,712
..and social-service.

1117
01:12:28,924 --> 01:12:30,016
Just like you, Aunt.

1118
01:12:30,426 --> 01:12:35,056
But no one can serve society
as Rajeshwari, isn't it?

1119
01:12:40,069 --> 01:12:41,502
What else do you like?

1120
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:45,104
Going out, watching movies
and fitting bulbs.

1121
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:52,271
Hello. Hello.

1122
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:53,775
l said wrong number.

1123
01:13:00,889 --> 01:13:01,821
lt was a wrong number.

1124
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:04,389
But the wrong number was
on that phone, Mummy.

1125
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:07,957
Enough of goodness for a day.

1126
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:10,364
Go. Wash your hands, come on.

1127
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:15,269
Dear, do you want to ask
Yuvraaj anything? -Me?

1128
01:13:18,374 --> 01:13:18,931
No.

1129
01:13:19,141 --> 01:13:24,943
Dear, would you like to keep
working after marriage, or..

1130
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,601
She's.. Nisha is very shy.

1131
01:13:49,938 --> 01:13:52,998
No one can be as shy as our..

1132
01:13:54,109 --> 01:13:56,634
Really, your sister
is very cultured.

1133
01:13:56,945 --> 01:13:57,912
And sweet too.

1134
01:13:58,314 --> 01:14:02,978
We like her. -And me too.

1135
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:09,457
So, is that done?
-Absolutely done.

1136
01:14:10,192 --> 01:14:13,059
And look, the marriage should
take place quickly.

1137
01:14:13,429 --> 01:14:15,761
Yuvi will get a house
in a month.

1138
01:14:17,866 --> 01:14:19,197
And our Nisha will bring
the good-fortune..

1139
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:20,563
..to turn it into a home.

1140
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:25,101
And, there's an auspicious
date after ten days.

1141
01:14:26,909 --> 01:14:28,638
A quick wedding and
a quicker marriage.

1142
01:14:29,244 --> 01:14:31,439
Just like our Rajeshwari
got married.

1143
01:14:42,624 --> 01:14:43,818
Please have some sweets. -Yes.

1144
01:14:43,892 --> 01:14:46,292
Sister, you'll make me fat
by feeding me sweets.

1145
01:14:46,362 --> 01:14:50,924
What's wrong with my heart?

1146
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:10,443
So, what is it that you don't
like about Yuvraaj?

1147
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:13,446
lt's not about Yuvraaj, Sister.

1148
01:15:13,956 --> 01:15:15,048
lt's about Rahul.

1149
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:17,682
You've fixed my alliance
with Rahul.

1150
01:15:20,295 --> 01:15:23,958
Wrong? l'd fixed your
marriage with Rahul.

1151
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:26,934
Now, l've fixed it with Yuvraaj.

1152
01:15:28,404 --> 01:15:30,429
lf she doesn't like
your decision..

1153
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,764
..then she has the
right to say no.

1154
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:47,647
She's na'l've.

1155
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,053
She doesn't know what's
best for her.

1156
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,118
And she's angry today.

1157
01:15:54,963 --> 01:15:56,294
But she'll understand tomorrow.

1158
01:15:57,433 --> 01:15:58,661
lt's such a nice family.

1159
01:15:59,168 --> 01:16:00,931
No one thinks about money.

1160
01:16:17,019 --> 01:16:19,453
Stay with aunt Nisha, l'll
get the offerings.

1161
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:29,561
Did you find out anything
about Rahul?

1162
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:32,457
Yes, he's close-by. -Where?

1163
01:16:32,835 --> 01:16:35,599
Will you give me chocolates?
-A lot of them.

1164
01:16:35,804 --> 01:16:38,500
First, tell me where is he.
-Finish the veneration first.

1165
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:43,335
Shlok. -Finish your
circumambulations first.

1166
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,738
..just like the earth
does around the sun.

1167
01:17:10,372 --> 01:17:11,964
No one was ever so
unhappy to see me.

1168
01:17:12,074 --> 01:17:13,371
Shall l leave? -Rahul.

1169
01:17:13,876 --> 01:17:14,934
That's more like it.

1170
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:18,108
So, tell me, how are you?

1171
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:20,511
When did you arrive?

1172
01:17:20,782 --> 01:17:21,749
Why didn't you inform me?

1173
01:17:23,118 --> 01:17:26,315
l know..Sister Rajeshwari
doesn't want us to meet.

1174
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:27,318
Correct?

1175
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:32,986
Where are you going, Mother?

1176
01:17:33,829 --> 01:17:34,796
For the circumambulations.

1177
01:17:35,297 --> 01:17:37,595
Why take such a big round?

1178
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,595
You can do it right
here. Like this.

1179
01:17:41,336 --> 01:17:45,102
And why? -Because the one who
takes the shorter round wins.

1180
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:48,437
Who said that? -Grandma did.

1181
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:51,543
What? -Yes, grandma told me.

1182
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:55,381
Grandma said Lord Ganesh
took smaller rounds..

1183
01:17:55,484 --> 01:17:58,817
..around Shiv-Parvati because
of which He won.

1184
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:01,689
Don't go, Mother.

1185
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:04,020
Otherwise, l won't
get chocolates.

1186
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:05,883
How is it connected with
the chocolates?

1187
01:18:06,194 --> 01:18:07,889
Aunt Nisha has said, Keep
mother busy here..

1188
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:10,262
..until she doesn't
meet Rahul.

1189
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:18,004
Sister Rajeshwari.

1190
01:18:19,942 --> 01:18:20,909
Come on.

1191
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:22,999
Carefully.

1192
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:24,341
Sister.

1193
01:18:26,715 --> 01:18:28,239
Sister, how can you do that?

1194
01:18:28,617 --> 01:18:31,711
Why? Do l need your permission
before doing anything?

1195
01:18:31,954 --> 01:18:34,013
But Sister, l've made all
arrangement for the marriage.

1196
01:18:34,556 --> 01:18:36,183
Just because you've prepared
for engineering..

1197
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:38,083
..it isn't guaranteed
you'll pass.

1198
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,588
But you were after me. -Fine,
l'm not after you now.

1199
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:45,065
You don't follow me as well.
-Sister, you can't do that.

1200
01:18:46,134 --> 01:18:47,795
Why? Are you the government..

1201
01:18:47,903 --> 01:18:49,894
..to tell us what we can do?

1202
01:18:50,906 --> 01:18:51,770
Sister, that's wrong.

1203
01:18:51,873 --> 01:18:52,862
l won't let that happen.

1204
01:18:53,241 --> 01:18:54,970
l love Nisha, and she loves me.

1205
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:56,236
And you promised me, Sister.

1206
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:57,537
You fixed this marriage.

1207
01:18:57,946 --> 01:18:59,777
So, l didn't sign
any stamp paper.

1208
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,249
Will you drag me to the court?

1209
01:19:03,518 --> 01:19:04,576
Put us behind bars.

1210
01:19:07,255 --> 01:19:07,949
Come on, Nisha.

1211
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:11,690
Nisha.

1212
01:19:12,995 --> 01:19:14,087
Let's go.

1213
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:39,886
l'm prepared to do anything
for your marriage.

1214
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:43,587
Yes. Tell me what l've to
do. -Nothing, Uncle.

1215
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:44,951
Nothing?

1216
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:47,795
Son, how will you get married
if l don't do anything?

1217
01:19:49,097 --> 01:19:49,927
Son.

1218
01:19:50,899 --> 01:19:55,802
Son. Are you crying?
-No, Uncle. l..

1219
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:59,106
l can count the feathers
of a flying bird.

1220
01:20:00,342 --> 01:20:01,274
Tell me the truth.

1221
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,902
Uncle, you reminded
me of mother.

1222
01:20:06,114 --> 01:20:08,378
He's missing his mother.

1223
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:14,351
Look, son. Don't worry.

1224
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:16,723
l'll do everything.

1225
01:20:17,726 --> 01:20:19,125
The bride's family is
doing everything.

1226
01:20:20,796 --> 01:20:23,390
You don't have to
come. l'm there.

1227
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:25,231
Fine, son.

1228
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:29,929
But do go to the
bride's family..

1229
01:20:30,038 --> 01:20:32,268
..and surely ask them if
they need anything.

1230
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:35,400
lf they need any help,
they can talk to me.

1231
01:20:36,344 --> 01:20:37,971
l'll do whatever needs
to be done, Uncle.

1232
01:20:39,848 --> 01:20:40,872
l won't leave them.

1233
01:21:14,216 --> 01:21:15,478
Didn't you bring the
police along?

1234
01:21:24,893 --> 01:21:26,485
The police arrest those
who commit crimes.

1235
01:21:28,196 --> 01:21:31,427
What do you mean? -No, l'm..here
to apologise.

1236
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:36,203
l'm here to tell you that
what l did was wrong.

1237
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,872
l don't have the right
to question you.

1238
01:21:41,943 --> 01:21:43,103
You're Nisha's elder sister.

1239
01:21:43,879 --> 01:21:45,847
You'll know better what's
best for her.

1240
01:21:46,715 --> 01:21:48,740
You can fix her alliance
with anyone you want.

1241
01:21:49,684 --> 01:21:51,311
You can fix it, and
then break it.

1242
01:21:51,887 --> 01:21:55,118
And get rid too..of you.

1243
01:21:56,491 --> 01:21:58,959
That's enough, leave.
-No, Sister.

1244
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:01,892
l won't leave until
you forgive me.

1245
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:04,288
And will you leave
if l forgive you?

1246
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:10,096
So, l forgive you. Go now.

1247
01:22:29,891 --> 01:22:33,292
Allah, did you really tell
Sister-in-law Rajeshwari..

1248
01:22:33,628 --> 01:22:35,755
..that Yuvraaj and Nisha.. -Yes.

1249
01:22:36,665 --> 01:22:41,398
But you told uncle Rajibali
that you and Nisha.. -Yes.

1250
01:22:41,803 --> 01:22:44,795
Because if l tell him the truth,
it'll be chaos here.

1251
01:22:45,473 --> 01:22:48,169
You mean..Sister-in-law and
Yuvraaj are really..

1252
01:22:48,944 --> 01:22:50,172
Do you think l'll
let that happen?

1253
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,145
That means you and sister-in-law
Nisha.. -Absolutely.

1254
01:22:56,818 --> 01:22:58,308
l'm just paving a way..

1255
01:22:58,653 --> 01:23:00,518
..so that Nisha and
l unite forever.

1256
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:04,816
That's why you told
sister-in-law Nisha this fact.

1257
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:05,951
l didn't tell her.

1258
01:23:06,094 --> 01:23:07,459
The green betel leaf
isn't right.

1259
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:10,323
Nisha is very innocent.

1260
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:12,127
lf she finds out the truth..

1261
01:23:12,234 --> 01:23:14,065
..then she won't be able to keep
it from sister Rajeshwari.

1262
01:23:14,236 --> 01:23:15,464
And my plans will be foiled.

1263
01:23:15,737 --> 01:23:17,500
So, it's better that only
l know about the truth.

1264
01:23:19,407 --> 01:23:20,840
Do you know what the truth is?

1265
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:24,744
Shaukat, the truth
is l love Nisha.

1266
01:23:26,047 --> 01:23:28,481
And only l'll marry her.

1267
01:23:40,862 --> 01:23:43,126
Sister. Why are you carrying
these things?

1268
01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:45,165
Let me carry them. -No,
no, l'll carry them.

1269
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:47,358
Sister, you know l won't listen
even if you refuse.

1270
01:23:47,469 --> 01:23:49,494
Why are you unnecessarily..
Don't be stubborn.

1271
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:52,540
Let go of this bag, and l'll
stop being stubborn.

1272
01:23:52,874 --> 01:23:53,841
Come.

1273
01:23:54,643 --> 01:23:56,668
And how are you? -Everything
is fine.

1274
01:23:57,345 --> 01:24:00,337
How are Surinder, Shlok and
Sana? -They're fine.

1275
01:24:01,483 --> 01:24:03,075
How are the preparations
for the marriage going?

1276
01:24:03,818 --> 01:24:04,750
Everything is fine.

1277
01:24:06,955 --> 01:24:09,185
Cards, musicians, catering..

1278
01:24:09,357 --> 01:24:10,722
Have you arranged
for everything?

1279
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:15,489
No, l mean..l was in contact
with these people.

1280
01:24:16,197 --> 01:24:17,721
l discussed with them about
the discount too.

1281
01:24:18,566 --> 01:24:19,931
l was getting a very
reasonable rate.

1282
01:24:20,235 --> 01:24:21,668
After all, l was
getting married.

1283
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:23,059
Here, Sister.

1284
01:24:23,571 --> 01:24:25,937
Keep this with you.
Take a look at it.

1285
01:24:26,574 --> 01:24:28,508
No. -Keep it, Sister.

1286
01:24:28,977 --> 01:24:30,171
Fine, l'll keep it in this.

1287
01:24:30,879 --> 01:24:32,904
You're my sister. l can
do this much for you.

1288
01:24:33,648 --> 01:24:35,206
l'll drop you, its close-by.
-No, no l've reached.

1289
01:24:35,283 --> 01:24:36,375
We've almost reached home.

1290
01:24:36,518 --> 01:24:37,712
Okay, fine, Sister.

1291
01:24:43,758 --> 01:24:45,123
l think..you dropped it, Sister?

1292
01:24:46,161 --> 01:24:47,093
l'm picking it up.

1293
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:49,888
l've kept it.

1294
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:55,101
7000 for the cards.

1295
01:24:56,838 --> 01:24:59,432
Band.. 2000 for the band.

1296
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:04,335
Tent, catering, car.

1297
01:25:04,846 --> 01:25:08,839
A savings of 18,200 including
everything.

1298
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,613
Rahul can bargain very well.

1299
01:25:16,958 --> 01:25:18,482
This is for you.. Sorry.

1300
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,891
This is mine.. Sorry.

1301
01:25:19,961 --> 01:25:21,121
You asked for orange, isn't it?

1302
01:25:21,229 --> 01:25:23,925
Yes. l was saying, Decorator..

1303
01:25:25,033 --> 01:25:26,330
Please can you charge
a 1000 rupees less?

1304
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:31,196
And in your case, l feel you're
charging 500 more.

1305
01:25:31,306 --> 01:25:34,833
And you.. lf you can charge
100, that'll be best.

1306
01:25:34,909 --> 01:25:38,572
And if we bargain, then we can
reduce a few thousands more.

1307
01:25:39,247 --> 01:25:41,875
Yes, we might get it for free.

1308
01:25:43,051 --> 01:25:44,177
Why will they do it for free?

1309
01:25:44,786 --> 01:25:46,083
They aren't related to us.

1310
01:25:46,755 --> 01:25:48,484
But we'll save 20,000.

1311
01:25:51,593 --> 01:25:53,254
l've already spent Rs.20,000.

1312
01:25:53,328 --> 01:25:55,455
How much more do you want? -30.

1313
01:25:56,331 --> 01:25:57,923
Think about that poor boy.

1314
01:25:58,767 --> 01:26:00,462
He was doing all this
for his own marriage.

1315
01:26:00,935 --> 01:26:02,368
lnstead, you're making him
do all this for you.

1316
01:26:03,271 --> 01:26:04,863
To save your 20,000
his heart doesn't..

1317
01:26:04,939 --> 01:26:06,463
..shatter into 2 million pieces.

1318
01:26:08,843 --> 01:26:11,038
So, have you splurged
your wealth?

1319
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:12,577
What if the plan doesn't work?

1320
01:26:13,148 --> 01:26:14,740
Look. -Laxmi?

1321
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:17,646
Pick up the phone
and save wealth.

1322
01:26:23,691 --> 01:26:24,919
No, l've hit the target.

1323
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:26,957
Bull's eye at that.

1324
01:26:29,397 --> 01:26:30,329
Yes, sister Rajjo.

1325
01:26:31,766 --> 01:26:34,530
So. ls the deal fixed?
-Yes, fixed.

1326
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:37,869
Don't change it later.
-We might.

1327
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,070
We'll reduce it.

1328
01:26:40,442 --> 01:26:43,605
We can reduce the rate
if Rahul says so.

1329
01:26:43,678 --> 01:26:47,944
lsn't it? -Please lower
the rate if you can.

1330
01:26:48,383 --> 01:26:49,748
How much will you
reduce it, son?

1331
01:26:50,552 --> 01:26:51,951
Let them spend some
money as well.

1332
01:26:52,353 --> 01:26:54,150
After all, it's their
family wedding.

1333
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:57,156
Yes, we've fixed the deal
and that's final.

1334
01:26:57,525 --> 01:26:59,823
l'll pay advance to
all of you. -Yes.

1335
01:27:00,028 --> 01:27:01,222
We've already received
the advance.

1336
01:27:04,365 --> 01:27:05,263
What do you mean?

1337
01:27:07,302 --> 01:27:09,770
Rahul, Rahul. -He means to say..

1338
01:27:09,904 --> 01:27:11,667
..Rahul's words are enough.

1339
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:15,839
You just make the final
payment. -Okay.

1340
01:27:16,644 --> 01:27:18,942
So, on that note, can
we've tea and sweets?

1341
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:21,874
Oh, yes, of course.
-Yes. -Until then.

1342
01:27:22,217 --> 01:27:24,276
l'll show them around the
house for the decoration.

1343
01:27:26,321 --> 01:27:27,652
Come. Please, come. -Come on.

1344
01:27:28,289 --> 01:27:31,554
l'll show you this part
later, and.. -Rahul.

1345
01:27:32,427 --> 01:27:33,485
Are you going to get
a big fat dowry?

1346
01:27:34,262 --> 01:27:35,388
Please take the measurement.

1347
01:27:36,998 --> 01:27:38,932
And make him stand at
the door, outside.

1348
01:27:39,634 --> 01:27:40,623
We've received the advance.

1349
01:27:41,102 --> 01:27:42,729
Why did you've to
open your mouth?

1350
01:27:42,804 --> 01:27:43,634
Come here.

1351
01:27:44,305 --> 01:27:46,273
This pillar.. -Yes.

1352
01:27:46,374 --> 01:27:49,104
Decorate that. -We'll decorate
this as well.

1353
01:27:49,944 --> 01:27:51,241
Go ahead, make me bankrupt.

1354
01:27:53,314 --> 01:27:54,941
Nisha. Nisha.

1355
01:27:55,049 --> 01:27:58,348
What are you doing? -Nisha.

1356
01:27:59,087 --> 01:28:01,885
l expected you to come
here, talk to sister..

1357
01:28:01,923 --> 01:28:05,290
..explain to her,
create a ruckus.

1358
01:28:05,894 --> 01:28:07,361
Otherwise, elope with me.

1359
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:10,288
Will you elope with me
if l tell you to?

1360
01:28:12,734 --> 01:28:14,634
By tarnishing the honour
of your sister..

1361
01:28:14,702 --> 01:28:15,964
..who has done so much for you..

1362
01:28:18,973 --> 01:28:20,304
l knew that you wouldn't
be able to do it.

1363
01:28:22,844 --> 01:28:24,744
That's why you're arranging
for my marriage, isn't it?

1364
01:28:26,614 --> 01:28:28,081
How could you imagine that..

1365
01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:30,880
..l'll marry anyone else
other that you?

1366
01:28:32,921 --> 01:28:33,853
How can l forget you?

1367
01:28:34,522 --> 01:28:35,614
Can you forget me?

1368
01:28:36,457 --> 01:28:38,823
Nisha, don't cry.

1369
01:28:40,795 --> 01:28:41,727
Believe me.

1370
01:28:49,404 --> 01:28:50,803
l'm doing the right thing.

1371
01:28:56,377 --> 01:28:58,345
Sister Rajeshwari only wants
the best for you.

1372
01:29:00,348 --> 01:29:02,248
You won't find a better
boy than Yuvraaj.

1373
01:29:03,551 --> 01:29:05,280
You'll be really happy
if you marry him.

1374
01:29:07,422 --> 01:29:11,483
You should forget me, and
think about Yuvraaj.

1375
01:29:13,127 --> 01:29:16,654
You're absolutely right, l
should think about Yuvraaj.

1376
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:21,163
A person who can't
defend his love..

1377
01:29:22,303 --> 01:29:23,998
..l don't want to
think about him.

1378
01:29:27,475 --> 01:29:29,102
l shouldn't shed tears
for someone..

1379
01:29:29,844 --> 01:29:31,471
..who can't think about me.

1380
01:29:31,813 --> 01:29:39,948
What's wrong with my heart?

1381
01:29:42,357 --> 01:29:43,722
Yes, Prakash. Have you
arranged for it?

1382
01:29:44,826 --> 01:29:46,191
The Saxenas are getting
married, no compromise.

1383
01:29:46,294 --> 01:29:47,283
Please. -Rahul.

1384
01:29:47,362 --> 01:29:48,454
Yes, Sister.

1385
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:49,722
Oh, Sister, sorry.

1386
01:29:49,797 --> 01:29:51,059
Prakash, l'll call you later.

1387
01:29:51,132 --> 01:29:52,360
No, you can finish talking
to him. -Yes..

1388
01:29:52,467 --> 01:29:54,697
No, Sister.. l'll
call you later.

1389
01:29:55,837 --> 01:29:56,565
Yes.

1390
01:29:56,771 --> 01:29:58,864
You really are a very nice man.

1391
01:29:59,107 --> 01:30:00,438
l misunderstood you.

1392
01:30:01,709 --> 01:30:03,836
l would've really got you
and Nisha married..

1393
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,804
..if l hadn't found Yuvraaj.

1394
01:30:08,316 --> 01:30:09,374
lts okay, Sister.

1395
01:30:10,184 --> 01:30:11,310
lf l can't get married..

1396
01:30:11,552 --> 01:30:14,180
..you'll have to allow me to
help you in the marriage.

1397
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,821
Okay, allowed. -Fine.

1398
01:30:21,629 --> 01:30:22,823
Now, l'll make this marriage
truly memorable..

1399
01:30:23,498 --> 01:30:26,331
..the kind no one has ever
seen or heard of.

1400
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:28,293
These are the wedding cards.

1401
01:30:28,369 --> 01:30:29,461
Fresh from the printers

1402
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:31,996
Enjoy before they get
old and stable.

1403
01:30:38,212 --> 01:30:40,112
This is Rahul. He's
a very nice boy.

1404
01:30:40,448 --> 01:30:42,006
Sit down, Rahul. -No,
Sister. l'm fine.

1405
01:30:42,517 --> 01:30:45,543
He's like our family member.
-Distant relative.

1406
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,180
But we're very close.

1407
01:30:47,955 --> 01:30:49,650
You're very interesting.

1408
01:30:50,258 --> 01:30:51,225
What do you do?

1409
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:53,854
At the moment, l'm only
interested in your marriage.

1410
01:30:54,696 --> 01:30:57,221
Once l get that done, l'll
think about the future.

1411
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,169
He knows how to talk. -l've
learnt it from you, Sister.

1412
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:04,633
l just remembered, you
haven't talked about..

1413
01:31:04,772 --> 01:31:07,434
..what you came here
for. -Oh, yes.

1414
01:31:08,009 --> 01:31:09,943
l was saying, you're living
in this guest house..

1415
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:11,703
..though we've our own house.

1416
01:31:11,946 --> 01:31:16,110
That isn't right. -No.
We'll stay here.

1417
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:17,714
Otherwise people will say..

1418
01:31:17,885 --> 01:31:19,978
..that Yuvi has become
a live-in son-in-law.

1419
01:31:20,822 --> 01:31:21,880
lf he doesn't get married..

1420
01:31:21,923 --> 01:31:22,855
..he can't be a live-in
son-in-law.

1421
01:31:24,325 --> 01:31:25,519
What do you mean? -No.

1422
01:31:25,626 --> 01:31:27,560
l mean, they'll call you
live-in son-in-law..

1423
01:31:27,662 --> 01:31:28,560
..only after you get married.

1424
01:31:28,863 --> 01:31:30,330
You aren't married yet, for
anyone to talk about that.

1425
01:31:30,498 --> 01:31:32,557
lsn't it, Sister? -Absolutely.

1426
01:31:33,134 --> 01:31:34,658
And anyway, Yuvi is quite
settled there.

1427
01:31:35,103 --> 01:31:37,264
So, the shopping, marriage,
and the preparations..

1428
01:31:37,505 --> 01:31:39,803
..will go smooth. -Fine.

1429
01:31:39,907 --> 01:31:42,876
Let Yuvraaj stay there,
l'll stay here.

1430
01:31:42,944 --> 01:31:45,208
And for the shopping..
-At your service.

1431
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,738
l'll help you in the shopping..

1432
01:31:46,914 --> 01:31:48,541
..and pickup and drop aunt
on the motorcycle.

1433
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:51,341
You were absolutely right.

1434
01:31:51,452 --> 01:31:52,817
He's a very nice boy.

1435
01:32:00,561 --> 01:32:01,528
Look.

1436
01:32:02,363 --> 01:32:03,227
How is this one?

1437
01:32:03,631 --> 01:32:06,691
Bride kidnapped from
the marriage dais.

1438
01:32:07,568 --> 01:32:08,899
Show me..the fourth one.

1439
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,934
Bride eloped, but sister-in-law
gets married.

1440
01:32:12,507 --> 01:32:14,236
What's going on in Palanpur?

1441
01:32:14,909 --> 01:32:15,898
Strange.

1442
01:32:16,544 --> 01:32:17,442
Yuvraaj. -Mother.

1443
01:32:17,678 --> 01:32:20,010
Have a lineage of
freedom fighters.

1444
01:32:20,982 --> 01:32:23,212
You all follow the principles
of Gandhiji.

1445
01:32:23,918 --> 01:32:25,715
You fight against social evils.

1446
01:32:26,954 --> 01:32:28,854
l know a girl who belongs
to a similar family.

1447
01:32:29,457 --> 01:32:31,550
Janvi. Principled.

1448
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,494
She'd be a perfect match
for Yuvraaj, but..

1449
01:32:36,197 --> 01:32:37,221
For Yuvraaj?

1450
01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:42,328
But son, Yuvraaj is getting
married to Nisha.

1451
01:32:45,072 --> 01:32:46,539
Show me that second sari?

1452
01:32:47,642 --> 01:32:49,200
ls this for Sister
Rajeshwari? -Yes.

1453
01:32:49,343 --> 01:32:52,039
Rahul. -Mrs. Rai, how are you?

1454
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:54,109
l'm fine. -Are you
here to buy saris?

1455
01:32:54,182 --> 01:32:56,013
Come, sit down.

1456
01:32:57,585 --> 01:33:00,179
You're buying many saris.

1457
01:33:00,655 --> 01:33:03,021
For Nisha? -Yes.

1458
01:33:03,558 --> 01:33:05,458
He's helping us with
the shopping.

1459
01:33:06,894 --> 01:33:10,159
l'm Mrs. Saxena and this
is my son Yuvi. -Hello.

1460
01:33:11,466 --> 01:33:15,527
l'm Mrs. Rai, Rajeshwari's
neighbour. -l see.

1461
01:33:15,636 --> 01:33:17,604
Then you'll have to attend
our marriage.

1462
01:33:17,839 --> 01:33:20,307
Me and Nisha. -Really?

1463
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:22,232
But Nisha.. -You're right.

1464
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:23,777
She's getting married
to Yuvraaj.

1465
01:33:24,212 --> 01:33:25,611
We lovingly call him Yuvi..

1466
01:33:25,713 --> 01:33:27,271
..that's why you were confused.

1467
01:33:27,381 --> 01:33:28,370
Show me that sari. -But..

1468
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:32,747
As far as l know, the
person Nisha likes..

1469
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:35,152
She'll like the red sari.
Show me the red sari.

1470
01:33:35,223 --> 01:33:37,691
You've given me the green sari.
Green again, then brown.

1471
01:33:37,725 --> 01:33:39,352
What are you doing?
-Brown again.

1472
01:33:39,427 --> 01:33:41,554
Come, Aunt. We'll look at the
other counter. -Let's go.

1473
01:33:41,629 --> 01:33:43,995
He isn't showing it properly?
-But you did like the sari here.

1474
01:33:44,065 --> 01:33:45,828
Green, brown, nonsense.

1475
01:33:45,867 --> 01:33:48,131
l'm stuck, someone get
me out of here.

1476
01:33:50,638 --> 01:33:51,570
Where did they go?

1477
01:34:03,484 --> 01:34:05,042
Bravo.

1478
01:34:06,888 --> 01:34:09,083
Mrs. Rai, where are you going?

1479
01:34:11,459 --> 01:34:13,324
To tell Yuvraaj about
me and Nisha.

1480
01:34:13,594 --> 01:34:15,721
Yes, there's nothing wrong
in speaking the truth.

1481
01:34:16,764 --> 01:34:18,789
Then let me tell you about
another truth. -What?

1482
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:22,735
Your daughter and the driver are
having an affair. -l see.

1483
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:27,508
What nonsense!

1484
01:34:28,009 --> 01:34:30,136
You should keep track of what's
going in your house too.

1485
01:34:32,113 --> 01:34:35,310
lf you again try to tell anyone
about me and Nisha..

1486
01:34:36,117 --> 01:34:37,914
..then you'll see your
daughter and..

1487
01:34:37,985 --> 01:34:39,612
..driver's poster on every wall.

1488
01:34:41,188 --> 01:34:42,553
Bravo.

1489
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:52,222
Put up posters everywhere.

1490
01:34:52,433 --> 01:34:54,162
Bravo.

1491
01:34:56,037 --> 01:34:57,902
l bought a lot of things,
it was fun.

1492
01:34:58,372 --> 01:35:00,772
Yes, l would've enjoyed too. -lf
Mrs. Rai hadn't arrived there..

1493
01:35:00,841 --> 01:35:02,536
..and spoiled all the fun.

1494
01:35:03,945 --> 01:35:04,912
What was she saying?

1495
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:08,007
You can never expect such woman
to think well of anyone.

1496
01:35:08,249 --> 01:35:09,147
They only know how
to defame people.

1497
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:11,545
She was saying Only
sari won't do..

1498
01:35:12,186 --> 01:35:13,585
Nisha is a very fashionable
girl.

1499
01:35:14,322 --> 01:35:16,620
She'll need matching handbags,
sandals, makeup everything.

1500
01:35:17,058 --> 01:35:18,218
So, l said, What's
wrong with that?

1501
01:35:18,759 --> 01:35:21,887
These days every girl likes
to stay decked up.

1502
01:35:23,698 --> 01:35:26,326
But Yuvi, Mrs. Rai wasn't
satisfied at that.

1503
01:35:27,068 --> 01:35:30,162
She was saying Nisha
likes jewellery.

1504
01:35:30,571 --> 01:35:32,937
Diamond ring, gold necklace,
she'll want everything.

1505
01:35:34,108 --> 01:35:35,473
l said What's wrong with that?

1506
01:35:35,843 --> 01:35:37,572
Her in-laws are wealthy.

1507
01:35:37,712 --> 01:35:38,906
She'll be their only
daughter-in-law.

1508
01:35:39,113 --> 01:35:41,206
Who else will they make
the jewellery for?

1509
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:44,450
Yes, you're right.

1510
01:35:44,852 --> 01:35:46,217
Yes. Come, Aunt.

1511
01:35:48,789 --> 01:35:50,120
She's a very evil woman.

1512
01:35:52,226 --> 01:35:53,784
There's no limit to the extent
she can go to defame someone.

1513
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:57,162
She was saying Nisha gets
fits at night. -What?

1514
01:35:57,365 --> 01:35:58,059
Yes.

1515
01:35:58,432 --> 01:36:00,866
l asked Have you entered her
bedroom at night and seen it?

1516
01:36:01,402 --> 01:36:02,460
lf you haven't gone
in her bedroom..

1517
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:04,299
..then have you heard
her screaming?

1518
01:36:05,006 --> 01:36:06,234
l did the right thing, isn't it?

1519
01:36:07,174 --> 01:36:08,368
You did the right thing.

1520
01:36:35,703 --> 01:36:36,863
Now, the real fun begins.

1521
01:36:38,806 --> 01:36:43,470
Aunt Nisha screamed,
and from our room..

1522
01:36:57,625 --> 01:36:58,819
Mummy. -Yes.

1523
01:36:59,293 --> 01:37:01,784
You run a social service
centre, don't you? -Yes.

1524
01:37:02,129 --> 01:37:05,860
lf someone gets fits, does
she scream like this?

1525
01:37:07,001 --> 01:37:09,526
Does she? -Yes, just like this.

1526
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:15,034
That means what we
heard was right.

1527
01:37:21,148 --> 01:37:23,981
But Rajeshwari didn't
tell us anything.

1528
01:37:24,051 --> 01:37:25,916
She won't say anything
now either, Mummy.

1529
01:37:27,021 --> 01:37:30,218
She'll come and say that it
was a cockroach or lizard.

1530
01:37:34,495 --> 01:37:37,692
Sister, what happened? -Nothing,
it was a rat.

1531
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:43,364
Please go and rest. -No,
we'll leave now.

1532
01:37:43,704 --> 01:37:45,865
Then please drop them.
-Yes, let's go.

1533
01:37:45,973 --> 01:37:48,999
Oh, no. Rahul is there.
-Yes, l'm there.

1534
01:37:49,076 --> 01:37:50,304
Okay. -Okay, see you.

1535
01:37:50,377 --> 01:37:51,401
Okay.

1536
01:37:53,781 --> 01:37:55,373
Aunt Nisha was scared of a rat.

1537
01:37:55,449 --> 01:37:57,041
Aunt Nisha was scared of a rat.

1538
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:01,117
The children are
trained as well.

1539
01:38:08,362 --> 01:38:11,024
Were you scared at
night? -Slightly.

1540
01:38:11,298 --> 01:38:12,424
Better get used to it now.

1541
01:38:12,933 --> 01:38:14,400
Now, you'll be slightly
scared while sleeping.

1542
01:38:14,769 --> 01:38:16,134
Why? Because l'm
getting married?

1543
01:38:16,537 --> 01:38:19,734
No. Because you're getting
married to Nisha.

1544
01:38:20,474 --> 01:38:22,601
God knows when she might
start screaming.

1545
01:38:25,913 --> 01:38:27,642
By the way, l salute
your courage.

1546
01:38:28,382 --> 01:38:29,679
You didn't refuse to marry..

1547
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:31,081
..though you knew
the truth. Wow.

1548
01:38:31,652 --> 01:38:32,516
What can l do?

1549
01:38:32,686 --> 01:38:34,779
What if Nisha had developed this
ailment after marriage?

1550
01:38:35,723 --> 01:38:40,160
Wow. What a thought!
-Not mine, Mother's.

1551
01:38:40,494 --> 01:38:41,620
l see.

1552
01:38:41,996 --> 01:38:43,793
l'll have to think of something
else. -What for?

1553
01:38:43,898 --> 01:38:45,297
Marriage. About your marriage.

1554
01:38:46,534 --> 01:38:47,125
You think so much.

1555
01:39:08,989 --> 01:39:11,082
l care about you more
than myself.

1556
01:39:13,327 --> 01:39:15,522
l talk about you all the time.

1557
01:39:17,498 --> 01:39:19,363
l care about you more
than myself.

1558
01:39:19,633 --> 01:39:21,430
l talk about you all the time.

1559
01:39:21,769 --> 01:39:23,634
My darling, my sweetheart.

1560
01:39:23,871 --> 01:39:25,702
My heart's filled
with your love.

1561
01:39:25,806 --> 01:39:27,671
Come steal my heart.

1562
01:39:27,908 --> 01:39:30,172
My heart's in a dilemma.

1563
01:39:30,277 --> 01:39:32,268
Come steal my heart.

1564
01:39:32,346 --> 01:39:34,371
My heart's filled
with your love.

1565
01:39:34,548 --> 01:39:36,379
Come steal my heart.

1566
01:39:36,784 --> 01:39:38,775
My heart's in a dilemma.

1567
01:39:38,919 --> 01:39:41,387
Come steal my heart.

1568
01:39:58,038 --> 01:40:00,029
No matter how hard you try..

1569
01:40:00,174 --> 01:40:02,108
You can't get me.

1570
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,974
Why are you after me?

1571
01:40:06,313 --> 01:40:08,474
My love is the blessings
of God.

1572
01:40:08,549 --> 01:40:10,483
lt's invaluable.

1573
01:40:10,885 --> 01:40:14,343
l've come across
many like you.

1574
01:40:14,755 --> 01:40:19,124
You might have many
lovers like me.

1575
01:40:19,193 --> 01:40:21,354
But l'm different
from all of them.

1576
01:40:21,862 --> 01:40:23,261
Why don't you believe that?

1577
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:25,361
My darling, my sweetheart.

1578
01:40:25,499 --> 01:40:27,558
My heart's filled
with your love.

1579
01:40:27,835 --> 01:40:29,496
Come steal my heart.

1580
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:31,761
My heart's in a dilemma.

1581
01:40:31,939 --> 01:40:33,770
Come steal my heart.

1582
01:40:34,041 --> 01:40:36,032
My heart's filled
with your love.

1583
01:40:36,176 --> 01:40:38,576
Come steal my heart.

1584
01:40:38,779 --> 01:40:40,713
Shake your feet, lock
eyes with me.

1585
01:40:40,881 --> 01:40:42,872
Come dance with me.

1586
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:44,915
Shake your feet, lock
eyes with me.

1587
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:46,916
Come dance with me.

1588
01:40:47,087 --> 01:40:48,987
My heart's shattered.

1589
01:40:49,156 --> 01:40:50,919
lt's not my heart's fault.

1590
01:40:51,058 --> 01:40:55,495
My suit's colourful. Your
eyes are so beautiful.

1591
01:40:55,562 --> 01:40:59,794
l'm your true lover, my
heart's crazy for you.

1592
01:41:03,904 --> 01:41:05,929
l can't take my eyes off you.

1593
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:08,040
l shower my blessings on you.

1594
01:41:08,242 --> 01:41:11,006
l wish..

1595
01:41:12,446 --> 01:41:14,311
May your life always be
filled with happiness.

1596
01:41:14,448 --> 01:41:16,382
May your beloved always
stay close to you.

1597
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:19,781
May you never be sad.

1598
01:41:20,654 --> 01:41:24,784
l won't let you face a
dearth of anything.

1599
01:41:25,092 --> 01:41:28,960
l'll take all your sorrows.

1600
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:31,264
My darling, my sweetheart.

1601
01:41:31,498 --> 01:41:33,329
My heart's filled
with your love.

1602
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,263
Come steal my heart.

1603
01:41:35,769 --> 01:41:37,760
My heart's in a dilemma.

1604
01:41:37,905 --> 01:41:39,566
Come steal my heart.

1605
01:41:39,907 --> 01:41:41,898
My heart's filled
with your love.

1606
01:41:42,076 --> 01:41:43,976
Come steal my heart.

1607
01:41:44,144 --> 01:41:46,271
My heart's in a dilemma.

1608
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,142
Come steal my heart.

1609
01:41:57,992 --> 01:41:59,118
Yes, come in. Come.

1610
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:00,918
Mind the head.

1611
01:42:01,261 --> 01:42:02,159
Come in, come in.

1612
01:42:02,262 --> 01:42:03,593
Bring the refrigerator inside.

1613
01:42:04,064 --> 01:42:05,361
lt's a heavy refrigerator.

1614
01:42:05,499 --> 01:42:06,329
Carefully. Yes.

1615
01:42:06,367 --> 01:42:08,028
Don't let it fall.

1616
01:42:08,235 --> 01:42:09,259
Come on.

1617
01:42:10,104 --> 01:42:12,698
Refrigerator, washing machine,
air conditioner..

1618
01:42:12,773 --> 01:42:14,707
..microwave oven, keep
all of it carefully.

1619
01:42:14,942 --> 01:42:17,638
To the left. Keep it down,
down. Carefully.

1620
01:42:17,911 --> 01:42:19,037
Carefully.

1621
01:42:19,913 --> 01:42:21,244
Okay, thank you, thank you.

1622
01:42:21,582 --> 01:42:24,050
And..and this diamond ring.

1623
01:42:24,752 --> 01:42:27,312
Diamond ring. This one.

1624
01:42:27,888 --> 01:42:29,253
This.. You keep it.

1625
01:42:31,392 --> 01:42:34,759
Bravo. Such an lot of dowry.

1626
01:42:35,662 --> 01:42:37,459
The families of all grooms
are like that.

1627
01:42:37,698 --> 01:42:39,689
First, they say We
don't want dowry.

1628
01:42:39,933 --> 01:42:44,700
And later they handover a
list of their demands.

1629
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:47,966
Take a look.

1630
01:42:57,518 --> 01:42:59,918
They've clearly said that
they don't want anything.

1631
01:43:00,521 --> 01:43:02,921
Then this television,
fridge..diamond ring.

1632
01:43:03,924 --> 01:43:06,017
Look, we don't have the stature
to give all this.

1633
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:07,486
So, don't.

1634
01:43:08,095 --> 01:43:13,397
Look, everyone was stunned to
see that you're giving all this.

1635
01:43:14,635 --> 01:43:16,102
Especially, Mrs. Rai.

1636
01:43:17,638 --> 01:43:19,367
Aunt doesn't want dowry.

1637
01:43:19,907 --> 01:43:24,606
When she refuses, we'll.. -We'll
return these things.

1638
01:43:24,711 --> 01:43:27,236
Correct. l've already discussed
it with the shop-owners.

1639
01:43:29,249 --> 01:43:32,275
Wow. You're so smart, Rahul.

1640
01:43:32,886 --> 01:43:35,013
So, Sister, l wasn't your first
choice without reason!

1641
01:43:42,096 --> 01:43:43,085
lt's a nice plan.

1642
01:43:43,697 --> 01:43:45,528
But don't end it here.

1643
01:43:46,867 --> 01:43:48,892
You're still my first choice.

1644
01:43:53,874 --> 01:43:56,035
We wanted to gift a double-door
fridge to Nisha. -Wow.

1645
01:43:56,443 --> 01:43:58,343
But it wasn't in the showroom.

1646
01:44:04,952 --> 01:44:06,112
Those who take dowry
always say..

1647
01:44:06,186 --> 01:44:09,986
We don't want anything. Give
it to your daughter.

1648
01:44:12,426 --> 01:44:15,554
People will think you're
one of them.

1649
01:44:18,365 --> 01:44:19,423
We made a big mistake.

1650
01:44:21,902 --> 01:44:22,891
Have you seen everything?

1651
01:44:23,403 --> 01:44:25,064
They're the best brands.

1652
01:44:25,572 --> 01:44:26,561
Rajeshwari.

1653
01:44:31,745 --> 01:44:34,179
We don't want dowry. -But..

1654
01:44:34,248 --> 01:44:37,740
Look. We only want our
daughter-in-law.

1655
01:44:41,455 --> 01:44:43,855
Please return all these things.

1656
01:44:46,894 --> 01:44:48,191
As you wish, Aunt.

1657
01:44:55,502 --> 01:44:57,265
Plan two has failed too.

1658
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:08,809
Aunt was insulted yesterday.

1659
01:45:09,883 --> 01:45:10,975
She must be hurt.

1660
01:45:11,985 --> 01:45:16,422
What did you do? -l feel like
breaking this alliance.

1661
01:45:18,492 --> 01:45:19,459
But mummy won't agree.

1662
01:45:21,061 --> 01:45:22,323
Because it's mummy's duty..

1663
01:45:22,396 --> 01:45:23,795
,,to think about the betterment
of others.

1664
01:45:24,498 --> 01:45:26,898
What is your duty? -To
think about mummy.

1665
01:45:27,801 --> 01:45:29,029
l was telling you.

1666
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:31,001
You're getting married
in the wrong family.

1667
01:45:31,939 --> 01:45:36,842
The best girl for you is..that
principled girl. -l know.

1668
01:45:37,377 --> 01:45:38,469
She's the right girl for me.

1669
01:45:39,813 --> 01:45:42,873
But there's no way to
break this alliance..

1670
01:45:42,916 --> 01:45:44,941
..and yet maintain
mummy's dignity.

1671
01:45:54,261 --> 01:45:55,159
There's one way.

1672
01:45:56,830 --> 01:45:59,890
Get yourself kidnapped. -Kidnap?

1673
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,998
Yes. lf the groom is kidnapped
on the day of the marriage..

1674
01:46:03,103 --> 01:46:04,331
..then the marriage
will be cancelled.

1675
01:46:04,771 --> 01:46:06,534
And it's neither the groom
nor his mother's fault.

1676
01:46:07,207 --> 01:46:08,936
l'll arrange for you
to get kidnapped.

1677
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:12,310
But what about poor Nisha?
-Don't worry about her.

1678
01:46:12,379 --> 01:46:13,437
l'm there. -What?

1679
01:46:13,513 --> 01:46:15,413
l mean, l'm there, l'll
handle everything.

1680
01:46:17,551 --> 01:46:18,779
You'll handle everything,
won't you? -Yes.

1681
01:46:19,052 --> 01:46:20,610
l'll even lay down
my life if needed.

1682
01:46:20,721 --> 01:46:22,484
l'll marry that girl
if required.

1683
01:46:23,890 --> 01:46:24,948
Thanks, friend. Thanks.

1684
01:46:27,494 --> 01:46:29,860
l'll arrange for an
expert kidnapper.

1685
01:46:30,864 --> 01:46:33,458
l don't want any violence
or bloodshed.

1686
01:46:34,167 --> 01:46:36,135
Everything should
be done nicely.

1687
01:46:37,137 --> 01:46:40,072
Yuvi is a good boy, he..
-Rahul, you don't worry.

1688
01:46:40,374 --> 01:46:41,170
Really?

1689
01:46:41,275 --> 01:46:44,438
And what about the
money? -Nothing.

1690
01:46:45,245 --> 01:46:47,736
lt'll be your wedding
gift from me.

1691
01:46:48,715 --> 01:46:51,115
Don't consider it a wedding
gift, madam.

1692
01:46:51,585 --> 01:46:53,246
lt's a real diamond ring.

1693
01:46:54,154 --> 01:46:55,849
Speak slowly, everyone
is listening.

1694
01:46:57,924 --> 01:46:59,448
What are you saying?

1695
01:47:00,027 --> 01:47:02,120
We won't accept a diamond
ring from you as gift.

1696
01:47:02,195 --> 01:47:04,561
l'm not going to give a gift.

1697
01:47:04,898 --> 01:47:07,628
lt's worth 100,000. -That's all.

1698
01:47:08,435 --> 01:47:11,427
lt looks so beautiful, it seems
like its worth 200,000,

1699
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:14,732
Madam, l don't want 200,000.

1700
01:47:14,808 --> 01:47:16,673
l want only Rs.100,000
of mine. That's all.

1701
01:47:16,777 --> 01:47:18,768
Yes, and l was coming to you..

1702
01:47:18,879 --> 01:47:20,141
..to pay your Rs.100,000.

1703
01:47:20,614 --> 01:47:22,309
You do your work. -Yes.

1704
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:25,914
But my husband had to go
somewhere urgently.

1705
01:47:26,286 --> 01:47:27,685
And the groom's mother..

1706
01:47:27,788 --> 01:47:29,915
She refused to accept the ring.

1707
01:47:30,324 --> 01:47:33,350
So, now, l'll have to return
the ring to you.

1708
01:47:33,427 --> 01:47:36,919
So, do it. Give it. -Why
are you screaming?

1709
01:47:37,564 --> 01:47:39,088
l'm telling you, l've
kept it somewhere.

1710
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:40,029
l can't seem to find it.

1711
01:47:40,133 --> 01:47:41,930
l'll return it as soon as l
find it in a day or two.

1712
01:47:41,968 --> 01:47:45,096
l want my ring, or Rs.100,000.

1713
01:47:45,405 --> 01:47:47,839
And before the marriage
tomorrow.

1714
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:50,574
Otherwise, l'll tell everyone.

1715
01:47:50,877 --> 01:47:52,139
Then whether you get slandered..

1716
01:47:52,379 --> 01:47:53,437
..or the marriage is broken..

1717
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:54,578
Goodbye.

1718
01:47:58,852 --> 01:48:02,549
What happened, madam? -Mind
your business, go.

1719
01:48:09,563 --> 01:48:12,225
You mean to say, l'm a goon..

1720
01:48:12,332 --> 01:48:14,664
..that's why Rahul didn't invite
me to his marriage.

1721
01:48:15,869 --> 01:48:18,167
l'm asking you something,
so, answer me.

1722
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:20,229
Sir, what can l say?

1723
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:22,198
Go see it for yourself.

1724
01:48:24,911 --> 01:48:26,811
Why didn't you say that before?

1725
01:48:28,482 --> 01:48:29,642
Sit down. -Yes.

1726
01:48:33,453 --> 01:48:34,750
Let's go.

1727
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:03,142
All set? -Absolutely,
smooth like a cake.

1728
01:50:03,477 --> 01:50:06,378
Bhikulal will be here any
moment to kidnap you.

1729
01:50:07,681 --> 01:50:09,808
Which one is Bhikulal? -Yes.

1730
01:50:10,517 --> 01:50:12,382
Amongst them? -Yes.

1731
01:50:13,053 --> 01:50:14,179
ls he amongst them or not?

1732
01:50:15,255 --> 01:50:16,244
l don't know.

1733
01:50:16,556 --> 01:50:17,750
l've never seen him before.

1734
01:50:22,762 --> 01:50:23,922
Bhikulal.

1735
01:50:23,964 --> 01:50:24,953
Bhikulal. -Wrong number.

1736
01:50:25,799 --> 01:50:27,699
Bhikulal, you're Bhikulal.

1737
01:50:27,767 --> 01:50:29,234
Then why are you inquiring
about Bhikulal?

1738
01:50:29,336 --> 01:50:31,201
Don't you see l'm in disguise?

1739
01:50:31,771 --> 01:50:32,760
Let it be.

1740
01:50:32,873 --> 01:50:35,205
l'm just checking whether anyone
recognises me or not.

1741
01:50:35,308 --> 01:50:36,605
Okay. -We'll find him.

1742
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:42,478
Are you Bhikulal? -Are you mad?

1743
01:50:42,549 --> 01:50:43,982
Excuse me, are you Bhikulal?

1744
01:50:44,284 --> 01:50:46,582
Oh, yes, my grandfather
was Bhikulal.

1745
01:50:48,622 --> 01:50:50,715
Are you here with the
wedding procession?

1746
01:50:51,758 --> 01:50:53,316
l've been observing you for a
while. This is the tenth one.

1747
01:50:53,593 --> 01:50:54,560
Come on, get out.

1748
01:50:55,262 --> 01:50:57,526
lf l leave, the groom will
leave along with me. -Why?

1749
01:50:58,064 --> 01:50:59,895
Are you the groom's father? -No.

1750
01:50:59,966 --> 01:51:01,194
l'm Bhikulal.

1751
01:51:11,111 --> 01:51:11,873
Uncle.

1752
01:51:12,212 --> 01:51:13,372
Uncle. Uncle.

1753
01:51:13,446 --> 01:51:15,812
Son, son. -Come here.

Uncle. -l missed you.

1756
01:51:18,785 --> 01:51:20,150
Yuvraaj, Bhikulal.

1757
01:51:20,787 --> 01:51:22,652
Bhikulal, the groom. -Groom?

1758
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:26,358
l came here to see
you get married.

1759
01:51:26,927 --> 01:51:28,588
But someone else is getting
married here.

1760
01:51:30,564 --> 01:51:32,191
Why didn't you tell
me all that before?

1761
01:51:34,034 --> 01:51:35,763
Anyway, it isn't too late yet.

1762
01:51:36,503 --> 01:51:38,027
l'll kidnap the girl right away.

1763
01:51:38,271 --> 01:51:40,262
That's why. That's why
l didn't tell you.

1764
01:51:40,607 --> 01:51:43,599
Uncle, Nisha.. -Fine, son.

1765
01:51:43,944 --> 01:51:47,402
Not the girl, let's
kidnap the boy.

1766
01:51:47,514 --> 01:51:48,913
Uncle, please don't do anything.

1767
01:51:49,282 --> 01:51:51,648
l've made all arrangements for
getting him kidnapped. -Please.

1768
01:51:52,485 --> 01:51:53,543
You too, son.

1769
01:51:55,255 --> 01:51:58,247
Look. After all, it's
in our blood.

1770
01:51:59,059 --> 01:52:00,356
Uncle, what are you doing?

1771
01:52:02,929 --> 01:52:03,759
Listen.

1772
01:52:03,897 --> 01:52:04,955

You..you didn't give
this platter yet..

1775
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:15,731
That glass-vase has come back..

Fine, l'll give it.

1777
01:52:18,745 --> 01:52:19,734

Come here.

1780
01:52:23,683 --> 01:52:25,913
Are you calling me? -Just

Please get some ice-cream
for Mrs. Rai.

1785
01:52:36,229 --> 01:52:38,629
She should know what real
almonds and raisins taste like.

1786
01:52:40,433 --> 01:52:42,492
Madam, he's watching.

1787
01:52:45,739 --> 01:52:46,865
That curtain isn't proper.

1788
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:50,432
Give this letter only to
uncle.. Yuvraaj. Who?

1789

only to uncle Yuvraaj. -Yes.

Now, you may go. Go.

Why would l call
you? -Nisha, l..

1793
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,252
Sister is right.

1794
01:53:08,361 --> 01:53:09,828
l should marry Yuvraaj.

1795
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:11,724
l'll be really happy with him.

1796
01:53:11,965 --> 01:53:13,193
Do you want to ask
anything else?

1797
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:15,333
Nisha, l love you.

1798
01:53:15,835 --> 01:53:17,962
And l won't let you get
married to Yuvraaj.

1799
01:53:19,673 --> 01:53:21,004
Really? -Really.

1800
01:53:24,110 --> 01:53:25,737
Yuvraaj will be kidnapped
right now.

1801
01:53:26,579 --> 01:53:28,877
And this wedding will stop
without much commotion.

1802
01:53:29,549 --> 01:53:31,414
But why didn't you..tell
me that before? -Rahul.

1803
01:53:31,518 --> 01:53:34,851
Coming. -Don't worry, everything
will be fine.

1804
01:53:34,954 --> 01:53:36,148
Rahul. -Coming.

1805
01:53:36,222 --> 01:53:38,019
Shlok must've given the letter..

1806
01:53:41,027 --> 01:53:45,396
'Yuvraaj, l love Rahul
and he loves me.'

1807
01:53:45,999 --> 01:53:48,263
'l want to marry only Rahul.'

1808
01:53:48,935 --> 01:53:51,301
'But l can't go against
my sister.'

1809
01:53:51,871 --> 01:53:53,771
'lf you refuse to marry..'

1810
01:53:55,008 --> 01:53:57,238
'Please refuse to marry.'

1811
01:53:57,644 --> 01:53:58,702
'Please.'

1812
01:53:59,079 --> 01:54:01,513
'Even if l've to stay unmarried
my entire life..'

1813
01:54:01,915 --> 01:54:06,579
'But l cannot marry anyone
other than Rahul.' Nisha.

1814
01:54:12,158 --> 01:54:13,887
Excuse me. Has Yuvraaj left?

1815
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,588
What can l say? -You haven't
taken him yet.

1816
01:54:18,031 --> 01:54:19,896
Now, we'll leave with
the bride? -Who?

1817
01:54:20,166 --> 01:54:20,996
The lover.

1818
01:54:22,102 --> 01:54:23,569
You tried to explain to me since
the past so many days..

1819
01:54:23,903 --> 01:54:25,165
..who the right girl for me is.

1820
01:54:26,406 --> 01:54:28,738
Now, l understood who the
right girl for me is.

1821
01:54:28,808 --> 01:54:30,639
Who? -Just watch.

1822
01:54:30,944 --> 01:54:32,912
Come on, come on. -You get lost.

1823
01:54:34,180 --> 01:54:35,545
The auspicious time
is passing by.

1824
01:54:35,615 --> 01:54:36,707
Call the bride quickly.

1825
01:54:52,599 --> 01:54:54,430
Priest, start the marriage
rituals quickly.

1826
01:54:54,801 --> 01:54:55,927
Enough of your charades.

1827
01:54:56,002 --> 01:54:57,560
lt's not right to insult him.

1828
01:54:58,872 --> 01:54:59,896
Leave me.

1829
01:54:59,973 --> 01:55:02,237
l'm kidnapping you. -Uncle.
Uncle, what are you doing?

1830
01:55:02,342 --> 01:55:03,673
Give me this hand.

1831
01:55:03,743 --> 01:55:05,802
Uncle, what are you doing?
-Give it to me.

1832
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:07,340
l'll take him away.

1833
01:55:08,114 --> 01:55:09,479
l'll take him away.

1834
01:55:10,283 --> 01:55:11,841
Uncle, don't..

1835
01:55:21,895 --> 01:55:22,725
You'll break his hand.

1836
01:55:22,829 --> 01:55:25,320
Leave me. l don't want
to be kidnapped.

1837
01:55:25,665 --> 01:55:28,031
And stop this charade. -Charade.

1838
01:55:28,434 --> 01:55:29,298
Charade?

1839
01:55:29,569 --> 01:55:31,298
Yes, this is a charade.

1840
01:55:32,272 --> 01:55:33,466
And this charade has
been plotted by..

1841
01:55:38,778 --> 01:55:39,745
Rahul.

1842
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:42,948
But why would Rahul
plot this charade?

1843
01:55:44,751 --> 01:55:46,685
Because he didn't want me
to get married to Nisha.

1844
01:55:48,388 --> 01:55:51,289
He tried to get me to
refuse the marriage.

1845
01:55:52,258 --> 01:55:53,919
And he hatched a plan to
get me kidnapped today.

1846
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:55,887
Bravo!

1847
01:55:56,329 --> 01:55:58,763
There are a lot of charades
in their marriages.

1848
01:56:12,879 --> 01:56:13,971
ls it true, Rahul?

1849
01:56:22,121 --> 01:56:27,286
Before we call the police..
-Police. Let's get out of here.

1850
01:56:27,527 --> 01:56:30,223
Better leave. -Excuse
me, don't threaten..

1851
01:56:30,597 --> 01:56:32,861
Uncle, let's go.

1852
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,661
Son, our daughter-in-law.
-Uncle.

1853
01:56:40,506 --> 01:56:42,599
Hey, girl, you can't
get married.

1854
01:56:42,675 --> 01:56:46,111
We're kidnapping you. -Why
are you giggling then?

1855
01:56:46,446 --> 01:56:47,344
Go ahead.

1856
01:56:48,681 --> 01:56:55,985
Pardon us, all this..all that..

1857
01:56:57,590 --> 01:56:59,353
This marriage.. -This marriage
will take place.

1858
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:04,492
And Nisha will be the bride.
-Yuvraaj is absolutely right.

1859
01:57:05,265 --> 01:57:09,497
You and Nisha aren't at fault
for whatever happened.

1860
01:57:10,203 --> 01:57:11,261
This marriage will take place.

1861
01:57:15,275 --> 01:57:17,641
Rajjo, go get Nisha.

1862
01:57:24,951 --> 01:57:27,476
Listen. -What? -Nisha.. -What

1863
01:57:27,553 --> 01:57:28,645
Bhikulal kidnapped her.

1864
01:57:30,056 --> 01:57:31,887

Yuvraaj, where are you
going? -Mummy, Nisha..

1869
01:57:41,567 --> 01:57:43,296
Sister, Brother-in-law,
don't worry.

1870
01:57:43,569 --> 01:57:45,298

safe and sound.

Hold.. Hold me.

1873
01:58:09,128 --> 01:58:10,925
No one will interfere.

1874
01:58:12,298 --> 01:58:13,822
Rahul will go alone.

1875
01:58:18,905 --> 01:58:19,894
l've a request.

1876
01:58:20,907 --> 01:58:23,341
Just like you brought her

home similarly.

1878
01:58:27,513 --> 01:58:30,175
And if you've any problem,
then l'll take her home.

What are you saying? -She's

1881
01:58:35,588 --> 01:58:37,579
You don't come along, that'll
be better. -Come on, Nisha.

1882
01:58:37,690 --> 01:58:39,681
Have you gone crazy?
-She's being crazy..

01:58:50,269 --> 01:58:51,258
Hello, Rajeshwari.

1886
01:58:52,905 --> 01:58:53,667
Rahul.

1887
01:58:54,841 --> 01:58:55,808
What's the use of

1888
01:58:55,908 --> 01:58:57,375
The marriage has been cancelled.

1889
01:58:57,510 --> 01:58:58,875
lt isn't cancelled, everything
has gone wrong.

1890
01:58:59,445 --> 01:59:01,106
l don't understand how Yuvraaj..

1891
01:59:02,582 --> 01:59:03,378
What a kick!

1892
01:59:04,017 --> 01:59:06,918
ls it because of our
letter? -Letter?

1893
01:59:07,286 --> 01:59:08,344
Why did you..

1894
01:59:09,856 --> 01:59:10,515
Which letter?

1895
01:59:11,257 --> 01:59:14,954
Go on. Go and tell everyone..

1896
01:59:15,028 --> 01:59:16,859
..that l stole your
ring worth 100,000.

1897
01:59:17,663 --> 01:59:19,631
And also tell them that l don't
have money to repay you.

1898
01:59:20,533 --> 01:59:22,865
But Sister, why would
l say that?

1899
01:59:23,569 --> 01:59:24,661
Everyone's creating
a scene here.

1900
01:59:25,238 --> 01:59:26,671
So, why not you too?

1901
01:59:31,277 --> 01:59:35,907
You won't say that? -No.
l've found my ring.

1902
01:59:36,382 --> 01:59:38,907
So, l've come here to
return the money.

1903
01:59:40,053 --> 01:59:40,883
You found the ring?

1904
01:59:43,022 --> 01:59:43,852
Where?

1905
01:59:44,624 --> 01:59:46,558
The woman who stole the ring..

1906
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:49,151
..came to sell it at my shop.

1907
01:59:49,829 --> 01:59:53,026
When l threatened to turn
her over to the police..

1908
01:59:54,133 --> 01:59:55,100
Here.

1909
01:59:56,135 --> 01:59:57,500
But we didn't give this money.

1910
01:59:59,739 --> 02:00:02,333
Rahul did. You must
have sent it.

1911
02:00:11,184 --> 02:00:12,082
We'll have to go back.

1912
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:15,378
Sister, Brother-in-law
will be worried.

1913
02:00:16,589 --> 02:00:18,557
No, l won't go back.

1914
02:00:19,292 --> 02:00:21,988
Sister will get me married
to Yuvraaj.. -Nisha.

1915
02:00:23,596 --> 02:00:25,063
Till now, we did everything..

1916
02:00:25,131 --> 02:00:27,531
..so sister and brother-in-law's
honour isn't tarnished.

1917
02:00:29,168 --> 02:00:30,567
lf we don't go back now..

1918
02:00:45,284 --> 02:00:46,717
Then why did he play
this charade?

1919
02:00:48,521 --> 02:00:51,115
Maybe he didn't know that it
would aggravate so much.

1920
02:00:54,227 --> 02:00:57,355
All he wanted..was for the
alliance to break..

1921
02:00:57,463 --> 02:01:00,762
..without our honour
being tarnished.

1922
02:01:03,603 --> 02:01:05,332
Otherwise, he could've
eloped with Nisha.

1923
02:01:07,907 --> 02:01:09,932
He could've told Yuvraaj and
his mother the truth.

1924
02:01:14,147 --> 02:01:16,308
And today, he even left without
saying the truth.

1925
02:01:19,352 --> 02:01:20,785
Rahul is such a nice boy.

1926
02:01:22,188 --> 02:01:24,679
lt wouldn't have been bad if
Nisha would've married him.

1927
02:01:25,158 --> 02:01:30,790
Why didn't you stop me? -l..

1928
02:01:36,335 --> 02:01:38,098
Anyway, there's no use of
saying these things.

1929
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:41,871
Yuvraaj is here with the
wedding procession.

1930
02:01:49,248 --> 02:01:50,510
Under the pretext of
Laxmi and Ganesh..

1931
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:51,912
..you did as you pleased.

1932
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,046
As you wished.

1933
02:01:58,791 --> 02:02:01,055
Now, with the grace of
Laxmi and Ganesh..

1934
02:02:03,062 --> 02:02:04,154
..do what's best for everyone.

1935
02:03:18,537 --> 02:03:19,834
Always stay happy.

1936
02:03:19,872 --> 02:03:21,032
Bless you.

1937
02:03:22,742 --> 02:03:24,903
Okay, do keep writing
to us. -Yes.

1938
02:03:25,544 --> 02:03:26,533
Sister.

1939
02:03:29,882 --> 02:03:30,871
Be careful.

1940
02:03:31,384 --> 02:03:33,409
And don't eat outside too much.

1941
02:03:33,586 --> 02:03:36,146
You might fall ill. -Why
do you worry so much?

1942
02:03:38,924 --> 02:03:43,156
Sister, forgive me. -What
are you saying?

1943
02:03:43,929 --> 02:03:45,590
Where is Rahul? -Yes.

1944
02:03:45,865 --> 02:03:49,164
There's Rahul. He's getting
tea for everyone.

1945
02:03:49,802 --> 02:03:52,032
He's such a nice boy. Very nice.

1946
02:03:57,176 --> 02:03:58,143
Shall we go?

1947
02:04:20,566 --> 02:04:23,091
Here. Your love.

1948
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:26,400
l..am sorry.

1949
02:04:27,206 --> 02:04:30,972
For everything. -No. Everything
is fair in love and war.

1950
02:04:31,877 --> 02:04:32,536
l was in a fit of rage.

1951
02:04:33,412 --> 02:04:37,371
But l can't stay angry all
my life. -How true.

1952
02:04:39,018 --> 02:04:40,713
Not me, mummy says that.

1953
02:04:41,554 --> 02:04:43,613
Why don't you say something?

1954
02:04:44,357 --> 02:04:45,153
Go on then.

1955
02:04:45,591 --> 02:04:47,889
l let Nisha go once
because of sister.

1956
02:04:48,494 --> 02:04:49,461
l won't let her go again.

1957
02:04:52,598 --> 02:04:53,690
Bye.

1958
02:05:16,522 --> 02:05:17,546
Vishal Saxena.

1959
02:05:18,424 --> 02:05:19,721
Hey, buddy, how are you doing?

1960
02:05:20,059 --> 02:05:21,924
l just arrived from America
after finishing my engineering.

1961
02:05:22,528 --> 02:05:25,156
Marriage? Oh, no.

1962
02:05:25,598 --> 02:05:26,997
Not there, l want to marry
someone from here.

1963
02:05:27,566 --> 02:05:29,261
No, no, my house is
being repaired.

1964
02:05:29,602 --> 02:05:31,536
So, l'm looking for
a place on rent.

1965
02:05:33,906 --> 02:05:34,565
Sister..

1966
02:05:35,408 --> 02:05:38,571
No, Sister, this marriage
is final.

1967
02:05:49,255 --> 02:05:51,519
The heart wants to rejoice.

1968
02:05:51,557 --> 02:05:53,457
Wants to create uproar.

1969
02:05:53,559 --> 02:05:55,550
Happiness has returned
to my life.

1970
02:05:55,861 --> 02:05:58,421
Run around announcing
your marriage.

1971
02:06:02,101 --> 02:06:04,331
The heart wants to rejoice.

1972
02:06:04,537 --> 02:06:06,630
Wants to create uproar.

1973
02:06:06,739 --> 02:06:08,570
Happiness has returned
to my life.

1974
02:06:08,941 --> 02:06:11,466
Run around announcing
my marriage.

1975
02:06:12,011 --> 02:06:14,036
Everyone will talk about me.

1976
02:06:14,180 --> 02:06:16,171
Everyone will talk about me.

1977
02:06:16,282 --> 02:06:18,079
The day l..

1978
02:06:20,553 --> 02:06:24,489
The day l get married, l
wonder what'll happen.

1979
02:06:25,124 --> 02:06:30,221
The day l get married, l
wonder what'll happen.

1980
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:40,197
Few flowers and a
small garland.

1981
02:06:40,372 --> 02:06:42,533
Ward off all the jinxes.

1982
02:06:42,741 --> 02:06:44,538
All the guests have arrived.

1983
02:06:44,710 --> 02:06:46,302
They've arrived.

1984
02:06:46,712 --> 02:06:48,942
lroned traditional shirt,
polished shoes.

1985
02:06:49,148 --> 02:06:51,343
l look like a handsome groom.

1986
02:06:51,450 --> 02:06:54,942
l've arranged for the horses
and the elephants.

1987
02:06:55,588 --> 02:06:57,715
How long do l control myself?

1988
02:06:57,957 --> 02:06:59,948
The heart's getting restless.

1989
02:07:00,159 --> 02:07:01,717
Everyone will be
present there.

1990
02:07:01,927 --> 02:07:04,157

The day l get married, l

1993
02:07:32,858 --> 02:07:34,655
She's here, she's there.

1994
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:37,124
Whether it's on land
or in the sky..

1995
02:07:37,396 --> 02:07:40,729
l see her face everywhere.

1996
02:07:41,567 --> 02:07:43,398
l would've brought
her home today.

1997
02:07:43,569 --> 02:07:45,662
Crowned her as my queen.

1998
02:07:45,871 --> 02:07:49,602
But look for an auspicious
date.

1999
02:07:56,782 --> 02:07:58,716
The day l..

2000
02:08:01,153 --> 02:08:05,180

2001
02:08:05,491 --> 02:08:11,259
