1
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,927
A long, long time ago,
lost in the mists of time,

2
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:30,202
there was a teardrop-shaped land
called Anga.

3
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:37,214
Here, a long forgotten tale
was eager to be told again.

4
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,386
lt all started one night,

5
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:45,413
when a demonic spirit returned

6
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,986
with the power to turn moonlight
into a blazing heat.

7
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,595
She had the power to annihilate
the entire universe. Her name,

8
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,225
lrendri.

9
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,659
She used her mystical Black Eye

10
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:28,462
to turn men into beasts,
spreading tyranny and destruction.

11
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,434
Slaughter everyone!

12
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,528
Burn everything!

13
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,503
Terrorizing and destroying
village after village,

14
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,409
lrendri filled the land

15
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:19,748
with the tears of its enslaved people.

16
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,302
Those who were strong
were drafted into her army

17
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,542
and marked with her Black Eye.

18
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,516
Under its mystical spell,

19
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:54,917
they swore allegiance
to lrendri's quest.

20
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,750
The weak were not so fortunate.

21
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,748
Sacrifice them to Sarpini.

22
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:13,195
Sarpini, these sacrifices
should quench your thirst.

23
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,072
You will fulfill my oath.

24
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,737
The Black Eye shall prevail.

25
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,342
Some corrupt priests
took advantage of the situation

26
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,479
to satisfy their own selfish needs.

27
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,217
They convinced the simple villagers
to perform meaningless rituals.

28
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:38,288
Our teardrop shrines are powerful and
will ward off the effect of the Black Eye.

29
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:42,600
This religious fervor spread
across Anga like a disease.

30
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:50,603
A dilapidated shrine
in the village of Agartha

31
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,907
was rebuilt in the shape of a teardrop.

32
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,751
Hail the five elements!

33
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:10,455
l welcome everyone to
the divine shrine of the five elements.

34
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,930
Tie a strand of your hair
to this amulet and place it here.

35
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:19,293
So what if you are bald?
You have a healthy moustache.

36
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,104
To complete the ritual,
offer your prayers.

37
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:26,844
The villagers foolishly
practiced these rituals,

38
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:33,213
unaware that the very evil
they were praying to be freed from

39
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:38,146
was gaining strength
deep below the temple

40
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,021
and emerging into their world.

41
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,345
The vicious attack of the serpents

42
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:04,246
left all the children
in Agartha unconscious.

43
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,982
lf this was any ordinary illness,

44
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,184
l would have cured it easily
long ago.

45
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,853
But this is a dangerous curse.

46
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,826
ls there no way out of this?

47
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:23,566
Swami, l know of a monastery
in the Pushpagiri mountains.

48
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,834
ln the monastery, a little girl
called Moksha has divine powers.

49
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:31,036
lf Moksha came here,
she could heal our children.

50
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,236
What is the point of having a leader

51
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,007
if everyone comes up
with their own solutions?

52
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,043
l swear on my son.

53
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,175
l was the midwife
when Moksha was born.

54
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,412
Believe me.

55
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,579
The journey to the monastery
is long and extremely difficult.

56
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,556
Who will escort Moksha back?

57
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:47,822
Ask Chitra's husband to go.

58
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,090
Then we'll know
if there's any truth to her words,

59
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,426
as well as my greatness.

60
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:57,867
l will make the journey
to save our children. l will go.

61
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,903
-Teacher...
-Let him go.

62
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,237
No matter how far a swing swings,

63
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:05,641
it always comes back
to the same place.

64
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:11,507
-Please return safely.
-l will.

65
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,279
l'll be waiting for you.

66
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,021
Swami.

67
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,999
Moksha, what brings you into
the inner realm, dear?

68
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,838
l found this wounded butterfly.

69
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,034
l can't seem to heal it,
no matter what l do.

70
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:49,137
l have tried many times,
but it's of no use.

71
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:53,148
Failure lies not in one's abilities,
but in one's mind.

72
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:57,281
You have the ability
to tap into the universal energy.

73
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,356
By doing that,
you will awaken the energy within you.

74
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,154
Try again.

75
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,246
-Hey! lt's flying, it's flying!
-Yes, my child.

76
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:37,785
The butterfly is living proof
of the special powers in your touch.

77
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:39,721
Do l really have special powers?

78
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,589
You were born with divine qualities.

79
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,861
What does that mean?

80
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:46,234
Peer into the enchanted waters.
You will see for yourself.

81
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,933
Some years ago,

82
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,309
you were born in Agartha.

83
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,679
Your mother passed away
right after your birth.

84
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:06,481
A divine voice foretold
the birth of a divine baby girl.

85
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,926
As she is born to bring peace
and salvation to the land of Anga,

86
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,054
Moksha shall be her name.

87
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,758
l'll take her to our monastery
where she'll be safe.

88
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,311
Do you now realize
how special you are?

89
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,815
What must l do now, Swami?

90
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,044
Just follow your heart.

91
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:37,382
My blessings will always be with you
in the form of these butterflies.

92
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,820
They will give you the wings
to carry you to your destiny.

93
00:12:55,107 --> 00:13:00,443
Swami, a terrible evil has befallen us
and wreaked havoc on our village.

94
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:05,215
Moksha, the children in our village
aren't waking up from their slumber.

95
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,816
Even the doctors are helpless.

96
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,746
We don't know what to do.

97
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,983
Please come to our village.

98
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,890
l won't leave the monastery.

99
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,018
You have to go, child.

100
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,829
Your presence there will help
the children of Agartha.

101
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,496
Won't you help them?

102
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,171
Okay. But can l go
after the ceremony?

103
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,566
Thank you, Swami.

104
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:32,007
l promise to bring her back safely.

105
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,841
Letting Moksha out into the world

106
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,714
is like exposing a divine flame
to the elements.

107
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,847
And this one needs
a strong pair of hands to keep her safe.

108
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,878
We have the right man for the job.

109
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,147
Yodha...

110
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,577
Yodha...

111
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:55,926
The Swami has sent for you.

112
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,258
He wanted me to give you a gift.

113
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,392
A gift? What is it?

114
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,130
Stretch out your hands.

115
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,599
Moksha!

116
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,603
-Moksha!
-Yodha.

117
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,809
He behaves like the youngest kid
in the monastery.

118
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:23,547
Moksha, wait!

119
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,682
Yodha!

120
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,159
ls he blind?

121
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,790
Yes, he is.

122
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,891
Then how will he protect Moksha?

123
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:40,098
Son, the blind see what we cannot.

124
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,642
Yodha. Yodha?

125
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:47,039
Caught you!

126
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:49,773
Let me go!

127
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,511
Make a fool of me, will you?
The Swami shall hear of this.

128
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:53,915
Yodha!

129
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,010
-Let me go.
-Swami?

130
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,486
She is becoming more
mischievous every day.

131
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,614
You're the one
who is becoming troublesome.

132
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:02,252
You have been impatient to leave
the monastery for quite a while now.

133
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,489
-You can leave tomorrow.
-Swami!

134
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,825
-Really?
-Yes.

135
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:07,865
-ls that really true?
-Yes, my son.

136
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,931
Forgive me for saying this,

137
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:13,028
but just last night, l was wondering
when l be would free of this place.

138
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,865
And here you are sending me off.

139
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,635
He's not asking you to leave.

140
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:17,733
Meaning?

141
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,004
He's asking you to escort me.

142
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,007
-Where?
-To Agartha.

143
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,379
lt's your responsibility
to take Moksha to Agartha safely.

144
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,279
Sounds like another mission!

145
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,378
l can't do it, Swami.
l can't do it anymore!

146
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,057
Long ago you healed me
when l was wounded.

147
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:36,416
l've been your slave ever since!

148
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,827
Mission after mission after mission!

149
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,988
That's all l've been doing.

150
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,501
l've wasted half my life here
serving you.

151
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,332
l am young.

152
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,567
Hot blood runs through my veins.

153
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:52,699
There are many pleasures
awaiting me in the outside world.

154
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,905
Red wine. White wine.

155
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,380
Country wine. Fresh grape wine...

156
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:03,920
l'm going to get drunk every day
and spend the rest of my life in bliss.

157
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,217
Don't think twice.

158
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,689
Bless me with your left hand.

159
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,784
And with the right,
usher me out, Swami.

160
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,385
Wonderful performance, my son.

161
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,922
Save it for the festival.

162
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,062
Blood...

163
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,766
l need blood.

164
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,769
Blood!

165
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,082
How long do l have to
thirst for blood?

166
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,963
Give me your hand!

167
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,828
My energy has diminished
and l feel weak.

168
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:20,488
Though l've caged you,
you've been good to me, little bird.

169
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:07,507
Dear Sarpini, the source
of all power. Emerge. Emerge.

170
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:45,607
My dear Sarpini.

171
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,515
At your service, Queen lrendri.

172
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:53,616
Sarpini, when the Eye does not receive
its usual drop of blood,

173
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,557
my body weakens.

174
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,591
l want to infuse the Black Eye
with a lot more blood.

175
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:02,861
lt doesn't matter
how much blood you take, my queen.

176
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:06,865
What matters is that
it be from your bloodline.

177
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:09,771
There's only one person alive
who is of my bloodline.

178
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,605
She is safely locked in my prison.

179
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,840
But what if something happens to her?

180
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,948
Every problem has a solution.

181
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,945
You are a spirit without a physical body.

182
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:26,616
This form of yours is a creation
of your powerful magic.

183
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:28,989
But the body has no life.

184
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,550
lf you want life infused into this body...

185
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:34,429
What should l do? Quick, tell me!

186
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:41,231
A baby with divine qualities
was born to the human race.

187
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,002
Her name is Moksha.

188
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,406
Only Moksha can give you
what you seek.

189
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:48,935
Sarpini, explain.

190
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,481
You need to mix Moksha's blood
with yours

191
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:56,078
during the next lunar eclipse
and feed it to the Black Eye.

192
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,817
Only then will you
become immortal.

193
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,589
Then triumph l will.

194
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,288
Who is this Moksha?
Where does she live?

195
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,087
Like a baby safe in a mother's womb,

196
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,795
Moksha has been cared for
by a monk for the last nine years.

197
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:17,708
ln the blink of an eye,
my men will snatch her from that womb

198
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,267
and feed her to the great serpent.

199
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,473
Then, my queen,

200
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:27,814
Anga and immortality will both be yours.

201
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:41,959
Come listen to a strange tale

202
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:48,471
A story with laughter, romance
courage, sadness and music

203
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:50,303
Like a scrumptious feast

204
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,400
A very unique tale

205
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,717
Once upon a time
there was a swordsman

206
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,755
He is the hero of our tale

207
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,391
His name is Yodha

208
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:39,222
l'm as handsome as the moon
and many stars pursue me

209
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:44,790
Though many pursue me
My heart longs only for my true love

210
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:56,032
l'm as handsome as the moon
and many stars pursue me

211
00:22:56,074 --> 00:23:01,569
Though many pursue me
My heart longs only for my true love

212
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,426
Her lips are bright like corals

213
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,162
Her words are sweet like sugarcane

214
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:27,966
She struts like a peacock
in all its glory

215
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:32,402
She has a million colors in her eyes

216
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,172
The movements of her waist
are like cannons firing

217
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,382
Her tresses are like cascading waves

218
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,285
l long for my man

219
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,088
My music is only for him

220
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:51,418
My life is but a journey to meet him

221
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:56,794
l'm as handsome as the moon

222
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:02,201
l'm as handsome as the moon
and many stars pursue me

223
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:07,806
Though many pursue me
My heart longs only for my true love

224
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,318
Beyond the seven seas
there's a secret castle

225
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:19,220
lnside which my love was held prisoner

226
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,427
The castle was guarded
by many beasts

227
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,329
To combat them l had tricks of my own

228
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,665
Did you defeat and chase them away?

229
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,466
Or were you no match for them?

230
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,674
Even the most savage of beasts
has a fondness for music

231
00:24:39,944 --> 00:24:42,879
l played a melody to tame the beasts
and made them dance to my tune

232
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,650
Overwhelmed with joy
they all surrendered

233
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:06,062
Suddenly a giant snake attacked me!

234
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,673
Just watch how l will tame
its arrogance

235
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:14,811
l'll play with it, tease it
and defeat it with ease

236
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:26,187
She was a prisoner of her own heart

237
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,954
Bravely, l freed her
from those shackles

238
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,894
And turned her into my love

239
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:37,626
Like golden grass beneath her feet

240
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,170
l've spread myself like a ray of light

241
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,834
l followed her like a shadow

242
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,373
His embrace is like a warm blanket

243
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,773
This life is his gift

244
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:56,119
This beauty is for him alone

245
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,054
l'm as handsome as the moon

246
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:04,551
l'm as handsome as the moon
and many stars pursue me

247
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:09,966
Though many pursue me
My heart longs only for my true love

248
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,152
Demons were all around me

249
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:40,593
Words and music
have no effect on them

250
00:26:41,966 --> 00:26:46,130
To defeat them
l use the biggest trick up my sleeve

251
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:49,369
This amazing sword

252
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,333
This amazing sword

253
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,904
You're supposed to go down.
lt's almost over. Fall, fall!

254
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,446
Look, they're all laughing. Get down...

255
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,676
Swami! Swami!

256
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:04,646
Our monks are all tied up!

257
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,490
Which one of you is Moksha?
Tell us or you'll all die.

258
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,363
Which one of you is Moksha?

259
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,066
Give us Moksha, or everyone dies.

260
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,195
Hey!

261
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,300
Forget about killing anyone.

262
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,400
You should worry about
your own life first.

263
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:28,343
Holding a sword does not make one
a warrior, you blind fool!

264
00:27:29,847 --> 00:27:32,714
Wearing a scary mask
does not make one a demon, you idiot!

265
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,882
Anyway, this is no ordinary sword.

266
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:39,150
Demon or not,
you will fall prey to its blade.

267
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,095
What is that mark on them?

268
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,496
My God! They are lrendri's men.

269
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,096
They have the mark
of the Black Eye on them.

270
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,267
Who is lrendri?

271
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:40,142
Where have you been?

272
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,873
lrendri is an evil sorceress.

273
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:44,174
What does lrendri want from Moksha?

274
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,216
Yodha, what's wrong?

275
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,025
lt feels like Priya's diamond eye...

276
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,155
What does lrendri
have to do with Priya?

277
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:00,964
Why are lrendri's men here?

278
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:02,761
lrendri is searching for Moksha.

279
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,296
Protecting Moksha
is your immediate duty.

280
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:09,698
l take my leave, Swami.

281
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:10,832
May you be victorious.

282
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:14,643
-Look after her, Yodha.
-l take my leave, Swami.

283
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:48,336
l've never seen
Yodha look so disturbed.

284
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,385
Yodha, who is Priya?

285
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,427
The pain in your heart will subside
if you confide in others.

286
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:08,691
Only then can we become friends.

287
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:12,100
All right.

288
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,635
l'll tell you, my little princess.

289
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,437
With no one to confide in,
l've kept my past buried within me.

290
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,281
l loved to travel.

291
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:34,715
Drinking wine, feasting and enjoying
the company of beautiful women.

292
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,517
That's how l spent my days.

293
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,587
l traveled far and wide
in search of beauty.

294
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,637
Welcome, everyone, welcome!

295
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,971
Welcome, everybody, welcome!

296
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:02,142
Come and have a look, people.

297
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,780
Your future lies in these balloons.

298
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:08,416
Pull on their strings and find out
what the future holds for you.

299
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,593
Come and have a look.

300
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,255
Find out what the future holds for you.

301
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:15,663
Even my wife can't predict my thoughts.

302
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,031
Here, take this.
Let's see what this balloon holds.

303
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,337
My future is hidden here?

304
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,706
l told you these are magical balloons!

305
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,504
You conceal what you have
and reveal what you lack.

306
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,712
You buy combs
though you don't have hair.

307
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:35,945
And you keep buying more!

308
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,987
Hello, beautiful!

309
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,452
Pull on the string.

310
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,615
Wow! Rose petals!

311
00:33:15,926 --> 00:33:17,416
You are as beautiful as a rose!

312
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,621
Beauty!

313
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,428
Beauty leads to attraction.

314
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,024
Attraction leads to infatuation.

315
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:26,760
lnfatuation leads to love.

316
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,235
And love leads to...

317
00:33:30,941 --> 00:33:32,408
Hey, dimples,

318
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,511
uninhibited love can kill you.

319
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,742
Hey!

320
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,013
They call me Honey. And you?

321
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,481
Bittersweet.

322
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,387
-Come on, tell me, sweetheart.
-Yodha.

323
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:21,823
My Lord!

324
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:23,587
What sharp features!

325
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:25,119
See this sword?

326
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,457
Have you seen a beautiful girl
with a satchel of gooseberries?

327
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,964
l don't care for beautiful women.
They make me nauseous.

328
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:34,927
Sweetheart, sweetheart!

329
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,167
Hey, sweetheart!

330
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,145
There is only one girl
who carries gooseberries around here.

331
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,608
And l know her name.

332
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,707
-You do?
-But l won't tell you.

333
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,243
Tell me, l beg you.

334
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,910
Her name is Priya.

335
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:52,115
-She's a fortune teller.
-Where l can find her?

336
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,915
-Have lunch with me first.
-Why?

337
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,390
They say that food is
the way to a man's heart.

338
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,121
So, will you come with me or not?

339
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,297
Fine. l'll come.
Now, tell me where she lives.

340
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,626
Hers is the last tent.

341
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,830
So beautiful!

342
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,192
Let go.

343
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,504
Hey, dimples,

344
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,640
how dare you take
such liberties with me?

345
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,912
What can l do?

346
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,346
You're so beautiful.

347
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,449
Why are you here?

348
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,381
How silly!

349
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,387
Why do you have a store?

350
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:05,459
You're here to sell stuff.

351
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,928
And l'm here to buy.

352
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,325
Sorry, we're closed for the day.

353
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:13,893
We're especially closed
for insolent fellows like you.

354
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,029
Now, leave.

355
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,402
Don't be rude.

356
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,411
lt's not polite to turn a customer away.

357
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:25,210
Nor is it polite for a customer
to overstay his welcome.

358
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:27,710
-Gooseberry girl!
-What is it now?.

359
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:29,949
l'll come to the point.

360
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:33,080
l'm tired from traveling
and need a little fun.

361
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:37,383
l want to have some fun this evening.

362
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:42,364
l'll accept anything that you can offer.

363
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:48,164
l get it. However,
that which you seek is elsewhere.

364
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:51,504
You will find it
at the other end of the street.

365
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,639
So, what do you have to offer?

366
00:36:55,212 --> 00:36:56,736
Your fortune.

367
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:57,940
Fortune...

368
00:36:58,816 --> 00:36:59,908
You mean fortune telling?

369
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,750
l don't believe in it.

370
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:02,911
Why not?

371
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,448
lf you know what tomorrow holds,
today becomes trivial.

372
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,189
The wise always think of the future.

373
00:37:10,227 --> 00:37:12,457
Fools, though, are content
with living for the day.

374
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,290
Which are you, dimples?

375
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,925
You got me there, gooseberry girl.

376
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:19,333
All right, l'll pick a card.

377
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,395
Will l get the girl l seek or not?

378
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,571
Got you.

379
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:30,341
Your cards reveal that you will be mine.

380
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,310
-Really?
-Yes.

381
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,419
But these cards predict
that l belong to this man.

382
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:39,780
A blind man?

383
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,125
So, for your prediction to come true,

384
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:45,627
are you going to pluck
some innocent guy's eyes out?

385
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,755
Who's this?

386
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,490
l see that you're practicing
to tie the blindfold.

387
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,661
Don't touch it.

388
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:58,270
This blindfold is my first gift
to my true love.

389
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,371
Does this mean
that l'm not good enough for you?

390
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:08,917
Yes, which means
that it's time for you to say goodbye.

391
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,046
Can you please get lost?

392
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:16,315
Fine. l know when l'm not wanted.

393
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:19,459
Such a waste of time.

394
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,826
But until you find your blind lover,

395
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:30,672
why don't you spend a little time
in my company, gooseberry girl?

396
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,700
What do you say?

397
00:38:34,678 --> 00:38:35,872
Fine.

398
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:38,073
But according to our traditions,

399
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:42,278
we celebrate a new friendship
with this sweet drink.

400
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,715
Anything for you.

401
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,085
Gooseberry...

402
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:09,002
A girl is like a lamp, my son

403
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,743
lf you don't take care
you'll be burnt, my son

404
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,595
My sweetheart must be close by.

405
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,132
Sweetheart! Sweetheart!

406
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,530
What's this?

407
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:33,730
Only the head? Where's the rest?

408
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,600
Oh, no! You've lost your voice, too?

409
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:41,675
This must be the work
of the gooseberry girl.

410
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,239
You spurn the ones that pursue you
and pursue the ones that spurn you.

411
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:47,476
Men are all the same,
that's their downfall!

412
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,820
Sweetheart, don't you worry.
l'll give you a hand.

413
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:04,927
Wow, he's a real looker!

414
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:06,634
Why are you giving him a hard time?

415
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,177
We've seen a lot of people
lose their money or valuables.

416
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,236
He's the first
to have lost his voice.

417
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:21,650
What you thought was a sweet drink
was a magic potion.

418
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,981
l can't understand you.
Speak up, please.

419
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:34,386
What's the point in shouting
when you've lost your voice?

420
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,003
How long will it be before
he gets his voice back?

421
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,998
lt may take a day or a week.

422
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,775
A month or a year.

423
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,974
For some, it's a lifetime!

424
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:56,512
The only one who can help you
get your voice back is me.

425
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:02,283
He says he'll do
whatever you want him to.

426
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:06,088
On your knees.

427
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,962
Salute me.

428
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:21,972
Open your mouth.

429
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,349
You witch!

430
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,328
What's happened to my voice now?.

431
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:45,496
You seem to have given him
the wrong berry by mistake.

432
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,867
l gave it to him on purpose.

433
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,838
He's a threat to all women.

434
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:51,033
So, l turned him into a woman.

435
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:54,137
Wait and watch! l will make you mine.

436
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:57,512
l told you before,
my lover is going to be a blind man.

437
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,846
Not a man with a woman's voice.

438
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:02,716
Give me my voice back, l'll show you.

439
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,526
Hey... How dare you!

440
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:14,761
l won't let you get off this easily.

441
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,697
Wait and see.

442
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:20,959
Never mind her. l'm ready to accept
whatever you have to offer.

443
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,498
Have an apple, then.

444
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:48,791
Evacuate this camp right now!
The Volcano's ordered it.

445
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:51,960
Lemons and melons!

446
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:55,664
ln my territory, even a flower
doesn't bloom without my permission.

447
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,639
lf it does bloom, it won't bear fruit.

448
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:01,474
lf it does,
it belongs to me, the Volcano!

449
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,446
l can swallow you scoundrels whole.

450
00:43:04,514 --> 00:43:05,742
Worthless gypsies!

451
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:09,684
Clear out at once,
or pay a fine of 1 00 gold coins.

452
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,251
Lemons and melons!

453
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:16,215
Sir, we are trying to make a living.
Please be kind to us.

454
00:43:16,426 --> 00:43:18,553
We will leave in a week.

455
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:21,086
Why should we go, Uncle?
This land doesn't belong to him!

456
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:22,895
Lemons and melons!

457
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,093
What a beauty!

458
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,426
A woman should not offer advice,

459
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,594
she should indulge in pleasantries.

460
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:32,440
You are indeed a beauty.

461
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,473
lf you agree to kiss me,
there will be no fine.

462
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:38,911
Lemons and melons!

463
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,149
Cherry or gooseberry.

464
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,912
-Lemons and melons!
-Cherry or gooseberry.

465
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,685
Why bother with the berries,
when l can bite those luscious lips?

466
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:49,324
First bite into this.

467
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,957
lt'll heighten your desire
and you'll get what you want.

468
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:55,795
Lemons and melons!

469
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,470
l fulfilled your wish.

470
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:08,035
Now, you fulfill mine...
Now, you fulfill mine.

471
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:12,946
What happened to my voice?
What happened?

472
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:18,543
You! What was in that gooseberry?
What happened to my voice?

473
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,749
l gave you a woman's voice.

474
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,757
Maybe now you'll learn
to respect women.

475
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:28,427
What are you fools looking at?
Grab her.

476
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,867
Leave her to me.
l have a score to settle with her.

477
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,706
Who are you?

478
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,977
One who lost his voice before you.

479
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,745
Did you bite into the berry, too?

480
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:51,020
lt's not an ordinary berry.

481
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,953
The worst is yet to come.

482
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:56,188
First you get a woman's voice.

483
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,420
That's happened already.

484
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,858
Next comes female behavior.

485
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,800
Your beard shall grow no more.

486
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,392
Will it fall off?

487
00:45:06,436 --> 00:45:08,427
No chest hair, either.

488
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:09,699
l'll lose that, too?

489
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,901
But how did you recover?

490
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:15,240
l begged the forest hermits
to change me back.

491
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:20,007
So, l need to settle
my score with her first.

492
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,876
-Leave it to me.
-No. lt should be me.

493
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,549
No. Me first.

494
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,217
-No. Me.
-A duel, then.

495
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,089
The winner gets
the gooseberry girl.

496
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,719
Then she will definitely be mine.

497
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,127
l'll kill you both.

498
00:45:33,196 --> 00:45:36,791
l am not some chicken
for you to fight over.

499
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,232
Don't bother with her.

500
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:40,798
Come. Duel with me.

501
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,771
lf you are man enough, that is.

502
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:51,507
You don't need a mountain like me
to crush a mouse like you.

503
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:52,980
Kill this fool, boys.

504
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,498
l don't even need a sword
to take care of these fools.

505
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:36,085
Lemons and melons!
Seen any stars yet?

506
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,745
l am the Volcano.

507
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:40,051
l can swallow you whole.

508
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,623
l let your men off easy.

509
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:44,626
l have something special
in mind for you.

510
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,820
What's that?

511
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,529
l'll fight you with my eyes closed.

512
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,725
Eyes closed?

513
00:47:58,074 --> 00:48:01,100
To show that l am willing
to spend the rest of my life in darkness.

514
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:06,771
Are you really going to fight
the Volcano blindfolded?

515
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,617
Not just with my eyes closed,

516
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,252
but also without stepping off this table.

517
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:02,823
Wait. Wait, no, no.
You can have the gooseberry girl.

518
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:04,197
But tell me how to get my voice back.

519
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,825
Brother!

520
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,493
You called me brother. l like you.

521
00:50:09,372 --> 00:50:12,398
The hermits in the forest
are your only hope.

522
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,871
Your feminine qualities
are getting stronger.

523
00:50:16,946 --> 00:50:19,881
Hurry before you lose
your manly attributes, sister!

524
00:50:19,949 --> 00:50:21,041
l mean brother!

525
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,052
Will l be able to stick them back on?

526
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:25,714
lt'll never be the same. Hurry!

527
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,253
l'll take care of you
when l get back from the forest.

528
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,060
Lemons and melons!

529
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:44,931
Gooseberry girl!

530
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,601
Hey, gooseberry girl!

531
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,013
You stole my blindfold.
Aren't you ashamed?

532
00:50:52,248 --> 00:50:54,651
All is fair in love and war!

533
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,484
lt's not theft,
just an attempt to win you over.

534
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,455
You think wearing a blindfold
will make me yours?

535
00:51:00,523 --> 00:51:02,457
You can't alter destiny.

536
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:05,421
Destiny or not, only time will tell.

537
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,726
For the determined,
time will provide a way.

538
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:47,502
He who will kiss me softly
like the breeze

539
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,663
He who will burn me with his passion

540
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:52,134
He who will love me till the end of time

541
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,871
Where can l find him?

542
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:56,673
He who will caress my hand like waves

543
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,078
He who will fetch me
the moon and the stars

544
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,413
He who will empty himself
and pour out his heart

545
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,941
What does he look like?

546
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:07,616
Look into my eyes and you'll know

547
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:12,194
Search your heart and you'll know

548
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:17,791
lt's me
Yes, it's me

549
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,803
Come, let's surrender to this love

550
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:25,904
Your love has made me your captive

551
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:30,537
Your love has made me forget
all boundaries

552
00:52:30,613 --> 00:52:36,245
Your love has filled
my heart with songs

553
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:39,984
What kind of magic is this?

554
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:44,653
This crazy sweet illness has tamed me

555
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:49,358
l was an outlaw
but l have laid down my arms

556
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:55,029
To sing a lullaby of love

557
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,566
Why does my heart beat so fast?

558
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,201
He who will kiss me softly
like the breeze

559
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,509
He who will burn me with his passion

560
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:06,708
He who will love me till the end of time

561
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:09,047
Where can l find him?

562
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,116
Your smile reminds me of falling stars

563
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:46,451
lt holds my feelings hostage
l become helpless

564
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:50,425
When l look into your blue eyes

565
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:55,726
l lose all my senses
l become helpless

566
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:59,667
Your smile planted the seeds
of this crazy love

567
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:04,298
Your touch gave wings
to this crazy love

568
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:09,677
Your lips sang the songs
of this crazy love

569
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:13,480
Come, let's surrender to this love

570
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:36,630
This crazy sweet illness has tamed me

571
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:41,269
l was an outlaw
but l have laid down my arms

572
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:46,908
To sing a lullaby of love

573
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:51,647
Why does my heart beat so fast?

574
00:54:54,657 --> 00:54:55,715
Hey, Priya!

575
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,789
Hold on, wait...

576
00:55:16,145 --> 00:55:19,080
Not yet. Our first kiss will have to wait.

577
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:28,882
What's this?

578
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,756
A family heirloom called the Black Eye.

579
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:34,320
l hope it doesn't contain any spells
or incantations.

580
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:38,759
lt might. Many of my ancestors
were known to be witches.

581
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,399
Are you also a witch, then?

582
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,099
Maybe. Who knows?

583
00:55:45,174 --> 00:55:46,505
l know.

584
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:48,669
You really are a powerful sorceress.

585
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:51,441
That's how you've transformed
a carefree fellow like me

586
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,445
into a prisoner of your heart.

587
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:58,249
l hope you've learnt your lesson
and will settle down.

588
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,516
Are you asking me to marry you?

589
00:56:02,558 --> 00:56:05,220
l just want to know what's in your heart.

590
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,028
l've always been pursued by women.

591
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:12,364
But like passing clouds, they drift away.

592
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:14,867
None of them ever touched my heart.

593
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,062
You mean l'm one of them, too?

594
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:20,131
Why, you dimple cheeked rascal!
You follow me around,

595
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,673
beg, plead and pursue me endlessly,

596
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:24,244
you wear a blindfold for me,

597
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,139
you fight for me and now...

598
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:28,247
Hey, wait, listen to me...

599
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:31,411
And now, you say l'm a passing fancy?

600
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:34,350
Hey, that reminds me.
What about your blind lover?

601
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,460
Rather than wait for a blind man
who may or may not exist...

602
00:56:47,603 --> 00:56:48,763
Rather than wait, what?

603
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,501
l better turn the one l have now
into my blind lover.

604
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:07,282
Through thick and thin,

605
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,290
through happiness and sorrow,

606
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:10,655
through poverty and fortune,

607
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,789
till death do us apart,

608
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,823
l will be yours forever.

609
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,628
You have tied a blindfold
and called it our wedding.

610
00:57:22,171 --> 00:57:24,969
l hope you don't slap me
and call it a kiss.

611
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,280
Yodha!

612
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,620
Gooseberry girl, l have returned.

613
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:50,154
Lemons and melons!

614
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:13,517
Lemons and melons!
How do you feel now?

615
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,049
Yodha.

616
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:22,724
Priya!

617
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,665
Look at her being consumed by the fire.

618
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:31,033
This is where your love story ends.

619
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:34,804
Priya!

620
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:50,389
Look at her! For the last time.

621
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:55,394
Gaze at the flaming end
to your love story.

622
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,630
Look at her!

623
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:03,963
You don't need your eyes.

624
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,400
lf you can fight without eyes,

625
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,569
you can live without them, too.

626
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,533
Lemons and melons!

627
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,634
Let's go.

628
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,067
Priya!

629
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,915
My son...

630
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:59,151
The Swami saved my life.

631
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,258
And he let me stay at the monastery.

632
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:12,463
lronically l fulfilled
Priya's prophecy by becoming blind.

633
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,501
Only, it was too late.

634
01:00:16,078 --> 01:00:19,138
ln death she found her love.

635
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,281
Forgive me, Yodha.

636
01:00:22,451 --> 01:00:25,045
l caused you pain
by stirring up your past.

637
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:29,155
You haven't hurt me.
You've shared my pain.

638
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,922
Shall l restore your sight with my touch?

639
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:34,690
No.

640
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:38,823
l don't wish to see a world without Priya.

641
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:46,532
ln being blind,
l'll always remain her love.

642
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:55,982
But how did lrendri come to possess
Priya's family heirloom?

643
01:00:56,018 --> 01:00:58,009
How are lrendri and Priya connected?

644
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,346
l need to solve the mystery.

645
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,723
Druki, let's go.

646
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:07,322
Yodha, be careful.

647
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:08,762
Tell that to Druki.

648
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:18,638
Eclipse, l command you.

649
01:01:19,508 --> 01:01:21,874
Moonlight shall turn into utter darkness

650
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:25,880
with the power of the Black Eye.

651
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,082
My queen! There is bad news.

652
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:32,211
The men sent to capture Moksha
have been found dead.

653
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,113
What about Moksha?

654
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,589
She has escaped.

655
01:01:36,892 --> 01:01:40,350
How far can a little girl run?

656
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:45,459
Send search parties
throughout the kingdom.

657
01:01:45,534 --> 01:01:48,594
Take the crow demons.

658
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:55,269
Moksha shall quench the thirst
of the Black Eye with her blood.

659
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:07,115
This way.

660
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:09,623
Careful, there are steps ahead.

661
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:10,875
Walk slowly.

662
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:14,424
Walk properly, Yodha!

663
01:02:14,463 --> 01:02:19,162
Why don't you lead the way
instead of riding on my back?

664
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,795
l'm a little girl and l'm tired.

665
01:02:22,104 --> 01:02:23,571
Druki, isn't that...

666
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:26,404
Why are you walking backwards?

667
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,239
lrendri's men are looking for us.

668
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:30,802
Someone needs to watch our backs.

669
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,506
l'm blind, l can't see either way.

670
01:02:34,216 --> 01:02:36,184
A blind man leads the way,

671
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,777
while the man who can see
walks behind us.

672
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:40,288
And l'm caught in the middle.

673
01:02:41,123 --> 01:02:42,920
Stop your wisecracks,
or l'll leave you here.

674
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,959
Don't forget that you're my bodyguard.

675
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,296
l should have never agreed to this!

676
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:49,592
lnstead of traveling with her,

677
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:54,228
l could have traveled alone in peace
and ate and drank to my fill.

678
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:58,466
The only thing you would have had
is a good scolding from the Swami.

679
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,075
Quiet! Someone's here.

680
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:04,745
Oh, no! lrendri's men!

681
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,808
Let's go!

682
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,261
Come, hurry.

683
01:04:09,778 --> 01:04:13,509
Crow demons, Queen lrendri
has asked you to help us.

684
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:19,478
Then it must be something
very important.

685
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,389
We need your help to capture
a little girl called Moksha.

686
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,916
We will capture her
and deliver her to the queen.

687
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,031
We should have stuck to the main road.

688
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:39,036
lt would also have helped
to have dogs chase you.

689
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:41,565
At least you would have
lost some weight.

690
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,942
Changing paths every time
you are scared

691
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,414
will never lead you to your destination.

692
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:48,745
-Wait!
-What's going on?

693
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:24,243
Moksha!

694
01:05:24,653 --> 01:05:26,280
Yodha! Yodha!

695
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:47,606
Swami, here's the ash.

696
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:52,173
lt's now sacred.

697
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,375
Mix it in water,
sprinkle it on the children.

698
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,784
You try a new ritual every day.

699
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,114
Nothing seems to help.

700
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,157
Even l'm a little scared.

701
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:06,687
Don't worry.

702
01:06:07,162 --> 01:06:10,962
l'll study the stars and the planets.

703
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,700
l will find the solution.

704
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:16,397
Your father will be back soon.

705
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:19,000
He will bring Moksha.

706
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,807
l have faith in him.

707
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:38,151
Yodha! Yodha! Yodha?

708
01:06:39,361 --> 01:06:40,726
Where were you?

709
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,662
Thank God, you're all right!

710
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:43,858
The crows snatched Moksha...

711
01:06:43,932 --> 01:06:46,298
Not crows. Crow demons.

712
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,098
They hunt people and eat them for fun.

713
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,694
What if they hurt Moksha?

714
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:53,339
l can hear them. This way.

715
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:39,145
We will now offer you to Queen lrendri.

716
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:42,219
Stop scaring that little girl.

717
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:46,021
l have a better gift for you. Come on.

718
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:50,027
lsn't she too small a gift?

719
01:07:50,532 --> 01:07:51,760
Let the fun begin!

720
01:07:52,534 --> 01:07:55,435
Come on! Come on!

721
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:13,279
Yodha!

722
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,514
Yodha!

723
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,992
Yodha!

724
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:40,240
Druki, what's the use of running
if one can't arrive in time?

725
01:09:43,111 --> 01:09:44,339
Let's go.

726
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:06,632
For all your bravado,
you couldn't come back with a little girl.

727
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:08,494
My queen,
even the crow demons failed.

728
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:14,772
Your excuses are an unpardonable
insult to the Black Eye.

729
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,877
No, my queen. We almost had her

730
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:23,510
but a blind swordsman slew
the crow demons.

731
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:33,427
The Black Eye doesn't like
others being praised.

732
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:34,887
Manju.

733
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,124
Your Highness.

734
01:10:40,435 --> 01:10:41,902
May the Black Eye prevail!

735
01:10:42,704 --> 01:10:43,932
General!

736
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:06,952
My queen.

737
01:11:06,995 --> 01:11:10,260
Our spies report that Moksha
is nearby, in the mountains.

738
01:11:10,465 --> 01:11:13,457
l will find her, kill her and...

739
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:14,661
General!

740
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,670
l want Moksha alive.

741
01:11:19,274 --> 01:11:22,471
lf not, l will chop you
into a thousand pieces

742
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,704
and feed you to Sarpini.

743
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:26,475
Yes, my queen.

744
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:17,062
Follow the kite.

745
01:12:25,273 --> 01:12:27,298
How can l quench my thirst?

746
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,174
Here, have some water.

747
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,713
Mere water cannot quench my thirst.

748
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:39,384
What l have is thirst of a different kind.

749
01:12:39,721 --> 01:12:42,781
The thirst for
the bittersweet taste of wine.

750
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,849
But what about your monkhood?

751
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:47,120
Druki, Druki...

752
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:50,023
The monastery and l
are like oil and water.

753
01:12:50,565 --> 01:12:52,726
We never really mix
though we're together.

754
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,137
My kite!

755
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:05,471
My kite!

756
01:13:06,314 --> 01:13:09,545
-Moksha, don't run ahead.
-Moksha.

757
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:10,943
My kite!

758
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:14,881
Wait.

759
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,224
Hey, wait!

760
01:13:28,236 --> 01:13:30,170
Moksha, where are you?

761
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,246
Caught you, little birdie.

762
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:43,241
-Moksha...
-Yodha!

763
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,452
-Oh, no!
-Go ahead and check it out.

764
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,154
Moksha!

765
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:57,958
Moksha!

766
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,427
Moksha!

767
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:11,301
Yodha, Moksha's kite.

768
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,348
lrendri's men are emerging
from the caves!

769
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,948
They might have captured Moksha.

770
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,284
Moksha.

771
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,039
Yodha!

772
01:14:48,683 --> 01:14:49,843
Moksha!

773
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:55,649
Let go of me.

774
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,320
Yodha!

775
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:16,869
Yodha!

776
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:18,270
Moksha.

777
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,904
Let me go!

778
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,180
Lemons and melons!

779
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,084
He's on the hill. Get him!

780
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,370
-Why are you cowards running away!
-Yodha!

781
01:15:55,283 --> 01:15:56,614
Let me go!

782
01:16:08,296 --> 01:16:09,558
Druki!

783
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:10,963
Moksha, are you okay?

784
01:16:13,768 --> 01:16:15,326
Lemons and melons!

785
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,732
Bring in the priests for the ceremony.

786
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:25,911
Hail lrendri's reign! May it last forever!

787
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,777
l am pleased. Very pleased.

788
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:33,680
The fact that you serve me...

789
01:16:33,955 --> 01:16:35,889
ls unknown to anyone, my queen!

790
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:38,418
Now, the end is near!

791
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,451
Let the ceremony begin!

792
01:17:27,475 --> 01:17:31,172
The apocalypse will be brought in
by poisonous fangs

793
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:34,079
The sound of revenge
hisses and crackles

794
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:36,874
A flaming tongue full of venom

795
01:17:38,586 --> 01:17:39,814
A hideous form

796
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:42,517
A monstrous presence

797
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,483
The ultimate serpent

798
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,489
l invite you

799
01:17:49,497 --> 01:17:51,089
l invite you

800
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:53,562
A hideous form

801
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:54,863
A monstrous presence

802
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:56,164
The ultimate serpent

803
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:57,967
l invite you

804
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:20,127
A powerful fiend

805
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,322
Scaring even the strongest of men

806
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,265
A snake that swallows up all others

807
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:26,664
A hideous form

808
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:27,895
A monstrous presence

809
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:29,334
The ultimate serpent

810
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,601
l worship you

811
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,468
A hideous form

812
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:34,667
A monstrous presence

813
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:36,267
The ultimate serpent

814
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,244
l worship you

815
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:57,162
l worship you

816
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:08,974
A hideous form

817
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,642
A monstrous presence

818
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,311
The ultimate serpent

819
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:14,139
l salute you

820
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:15,749
A terrifying form

821
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,509
A monstrous presence

822
01:19:17,585 --> 01:19:19,109
The ultimate serpent

823
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,778
l salute you

824
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:29,194
l salute you

825
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,332
The Black Eye shall prevail!

826
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:15,751
lrendri will rule!

827
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,777
What a fight.

828
01:20:22,183 --> 01:20:23,650
Moksha, are you tired?

829
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:54,712
Looks like everyone here
is a teardrop devotee.

830
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:58,884
Teardrop and Black Eye.
There's something fishy about this.

831
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,383
What's wrong?

832
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,019
What's that smell?

833
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:08,851
Jasmine leaves, dates, fragrant flowers,
musk all mixed together

834
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,595
to form a unique aroma.

835
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:16,431
Rich and intoxicating.

836
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:19,832
White and red wine!

837
01:21:21,876 --> 01:21:22,934
Other exotic wines.

838
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:25,273
l can't stop myself.

839
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:27,541
Yodha!

840
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:29,641
lt will be your fault
if we don't make it in time.

841
01:21:29,717 --> 01:21:31,184
You don't have any money.

842
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,881
What l have is thirst.

843
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,880
l will find some fool to quench it.

844
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:39,053
Druki, stop him.

845
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:49,002
Hey! Don't you know
it's a bad omen to sneeze?

846
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,765
Who are you?

847
01:21:50,838 --> 01:21:51,998
Who are you?

848
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,199
My name is Jaffa.

849
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:55,268
Jaffa.

850
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:57,644
But who are you?

851
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:58,804
You tell me.

852
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,279
Why? Can't you talk?

853
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:01,577
l'm blind.

854
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:03,675
Sir, your honey-mixed red wine.

855
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:06,783
My honey-mixed red wine.

856
01:22:08,389 --> 01:22:09,447
Red wine!

857
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:12,116
Why does the mention of red wine
make you weep?

858
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:16,620
Red wine reminds me
of my friend Veeraiah.

859
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:17,789
What happened to him?

860
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,933
-Like you, he...
-What?

861
01:22:21,135 --> 01:22:23,467
-...started drinking red wine and...
-And...

862
01:22:23,938 --> 01:22:26,498
-...died.
-Died? He's dead?

863
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,633
l tried to tell him.
But he didn't listen to me, Jaffa.

864
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:32,110
That fool might have not listened,
but this Jaffa will.

865
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:34,181
-What was your advice?
-''Jaffa,

866
01:22:34,315 --> 01:22:37,113
''before you drink the wine,
let some fool taste it.

867
01:22:37,151 --> 01:22:40,484
''You'll then know if it's poisoned.''

868
01:22:40,688 --> 01:22:42,849
Why bother looking for some fool?
You taste it.

869
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,356
Me! But... But it might be poison...

870
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,322
That's all right. Go ahead.

871
01:22:47,795 --> 01:22:49,592
-Okay.
-Finish it.

872
01:22:55,670 --> 01:22:57,035
ls there any poison in it?

873
01:22:57,505 --> 01:23:00,167
-There's no poison in it.
-There is no wine in it, either.

874
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:02,709
-Hey, get me a hot toddy.
-Yes, sir.

875
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:03,835
Oh, no! Hot toddy!

876
01:23:03,911 --> 01:23:06,471
Why are you crying
at the mention of a hot toddy?

877
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,741
Does a hot toddy remind you
of someone else?

878
01:23:08,816 --> 01:23:12,308
A hot toddy reminds me
of my friend Tataji.

879
01:23:12,353 --> 01:23:13,752
Why? What happened?

880
01:23:13,821 --> 01:23:16,187
He drank a hot toddy and...

881
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:17,315
What happened to him?

882
01:23:17,358 --> 01:23:19,019
He went home.

883
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:22,086
That's good.
You should be happy, not sad.

884
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:24,654
Once he got home,
he slept soundly on his cot.

885
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,099
So soundly that his wife
couldn't wake him up the next morning.

886
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:29,864
lt's not easy to wake up
after drinking all night.

887
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:34,707
She hit him again and again.
But he never woke up.

888
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:37,069
Oh, dear! What happened?

889
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:40,080
They had to carry him on that bed
to the crematorium...

890
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,980
Crematorium? Oh, no! Don't be sad.

891
01:23:43,017 --> 01:23:45,645
Come, relax.
Here, have a taste of the hot toddy.

892
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:47,848
Tataji...

893
01:23:49,424 --> 01:23:51,415
He would be here today
had he listened to you.

894
01:23:51,759 --> 01:23:53,249
-Yes.
-What else do you have?

895
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:54,659
Water.

896
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:55,856
Water?

897
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:58,261
Why? Does water also remind you
of someone?

898
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:00,564
From now on, it will remind me of a fool.

899
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:02,567
Who's that fool?

900
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:08,542
The fool who believed my tales,
gave me his drinks

901
01:24:08,876 --> 01:24:12,107
and ended up drinking water!

902
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:18,110
Oh, no! That's me!

903
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,482
What's this?

904
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:30,488
Why are you crying?

905
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:33,056
l'm crying for you.

906
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:34,966
Why are you crying for me?

907
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:38,472
Unable to bear the deaths of my friends
Veeraiah and Tataji,

908
01:24:38,539 --> 01:24:42,373
l mixed poison in that wine
to kill myself.

909
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,776
But you drank it.

910
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:50,775
A free drink for a thirsty warrior.

911
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:59,518
Your bangles bring back
fond memories.

912
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:04,131
A toast to those wonderful memories.

913
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:02,888
We're done eating.

914
01:26:03,858 --> 01:26:05,553
Why is Yodha taking so long?

915
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:08,253
Let's wait a while,
then go find him.

916
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:16,562
Lemons and melons!

917
01:26:16,637 --> 01:26:18,229
She's right here! Get her!

918
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:37,190
General.

919
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:38,584
The Black Eye shall prevail!

920
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:40,691
You have pleased lrendri.

921
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:43,253
-You may leave now.
-Yes, my queen.

922
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:47,831
How amusing!

923
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:51,766
The hopes of the people of Agartha

924
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:54,630
rest on these tender shoulders?

925
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:01,273
l don't know why the people of Anga
fear a mere mortal like you.

926
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:03,112
You don't scare me.

927
01:27:06,153 --> 01:27:08,587
l'm not a mortal. l'm a spirit.

928
01:27:08,956 --> 01:27:12,722
A spirit who is about to transform into
an all-powerful goddess!

929
01:27:31,045 --> 01:27:33,445
lf it's just magic
that makes you powerful,

930
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,348
l can perform miracles, too.

931
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:44,683
Tomorrow night, during the eclipse,
you will be sacrificed.

932
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:49,590
And l'll transform into a goddess.

933
01:27:54,468 --> 01:27:56,459
My little bird in a cage.

934
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,471
You may be my captive,

935
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:02,566
but you have made me
a slave to your blood.

936
01:28:03,277 --> 01:28:06,371
You are the only one in our bloodline

937
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:09,939
to have had the honor
of serving the Black Eye.

938
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:12,909
My dear great granddaughter.

939
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:22,157
This will be the last drop of blood

940
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:25,995
l need from you before the eclipse.

941
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:34,271
l'll feed you to the very flames
that freed me.

942
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:27,424
lt has been a long time long
since l met someone from my family.

943
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:32,396
Priya, my great, great,
great granddaughter!

944
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:34,359
Don't be scared.

945
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:38,905
l'm your great, great,
great grandmother!

946
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,571
Don't you understand?

947
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:45,274
l am the great sorceress,

948
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:50,249
the all-powerful lrendri.

949
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:56,418
lt's not that easy to run away from me.

950
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:58,487
l started the bloodline

951
01:29:59,093 --> 01:30:03,496
and you are the last
surviving pure blood.

952
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:07,759
l thought the witch lrendri
was only a myth.

953
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:12,563
Myths are often truer than facts.

954
01:30:12,773 --> 01:30:15,742
l was imprisoned in this heirloom.

955
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:19,970
You caused my resurrection
by bathing it in flames.

956
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:21,976
l've been wronged.

957
01:30:22,149 --> 01:30:24,379
l will bring forth the apocalypse!

958
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:25,646
You and me together...

959
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:26,778
Never!

960
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:31,190
l may share your bloodline,
but not your thirst for vengeance.

961
01:30:31,258 --> 01:30:35,251
Whether you like it or not,
you will do as l say.

962
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:38,057
The Black Eye will force you.

963
01:30:38,299 --> 01:30:40,096
lt will enslave you to its will.

964
01:30:40,301 --> 01:30:43,930
All l need from you is
a drop of your blood from time to time.

965
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:45,733
That's all.

966
01:31:06,994 --> 01:31:08,086
Who's there?

967
01:31:08,629 --> 01:31:09,755
Don't cry.

968
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:12,493
My bodyguard will come to save me.

969
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:14,330
l'll ask him to help you, too.

970
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:19,766
Yodha, where are you?

971
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,920
Please bring Yodha here.

972
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:44,362
Tell him to free me from this prison.

973
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:24,898
Moksha!

974
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:32,902
A butterfly?

975
01:32:35,015 --> 01:32:36,073
Moksha!

976
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:42,915
Where have you been?
They've taken Moksha.

977
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:44,584
They left you behind
because you were too heavy?

978
01:33:44,818 --> 01:33:45,910
Yodha!

979
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:47,818
Okay, okay.
Where did they take Moksha?

980
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,156
lnto that snake-like cave.
How do we get in?

981
01:33:51,558 --> 01:33:52,616
Druki, Druki.

982
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,855
lt's not how we get in,

983
01:33:54,929 --> 01:33:56,453
but how we get out
that's important.

984
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:58,056
So, how will we get out?

985
01:33:58,132 --> 01:33:59,497
We'll know that after we get in.

986
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:01,964
For now, just follow the butterfly.

987
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:07,005
lt's night now.
The right time to sneak in.

988
01:34:48,615 --> 01:34:49,912
-Yodha!
-Moksha.

989
01:34:49,984 --> 01:34:51,417
Watch out for the snakes!

990
01:34:52,052 --> 01:34:53,519
l knew you would come.

991
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:56,756
Forgive me, Moksha.

992
01:34:57,891 --> 01:34:59,358
Many a hope rests on you.

993
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:02,362
l won't be careless in my duties again.

994
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:17,738
Yodha!

995
01:36:30,150 --> 01:36:31,310
Lemons and melons!

996
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:34,652
lt's the blind boy from the gypsy village.

997
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:38,315
Strange that you are still alive
and doing so well.

998
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:39,654
Volcano!

999
01:36:41,995 --> 01:36:45,192
You killed my Priya
and destroyed my sight.

1000
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:48,694
Every day l regret not having killed you,

1001
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,301
and that feeling ends today!

1002
01:36:51,738 --> 01:36:53,205
Lemons and melons!

1003
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:25,596
Hey, you!

1004
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:27,232
Lemons and melons!

1005
01:37:52,232 --> 01:37:53,290
Yodha!

1006
01:37:57,137 --> 01:37:58,195
Moksha!

1007
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:00,567
Quick, get out of here!

1008
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:45,315
This is to avenge Priya's death!

1009
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:50,454
Priya is alive!

1010
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:53,886
But she's trapped in hell.

1011
01:38:54,928 --> 01:38:58,625
You will never find her.

1012
01:38:58,865 --> 01:39:00,594
Lemons and melons...

1013
01:39:03,971 --> 01:39:05,939
Priya is alive? Where is she?

1014
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:09,174
Where is she? Tell me! Tell me!

1015
01:39:12,646 --> 01:39:15,444
Priya! Priya!

1016
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:19,384
Yodha, l heard a woman's voice
in the dungeons.

1017
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,710
Could she be Priya?

1018
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:55,681
Priya?

1019
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:57,817
Priya!

1020
01:39:57,858 --> 01:39:59,325
Speak, Priya. lt's me!

1021
01:39:59,726 --> 01:40:02,957
lt's me, Yodha. Your Yodha.

1022
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:04,691
Don't you recognize me?

1023
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:06,658
Don't you recognize me?

1024
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,525
What has lrendri done to you, Priya?

1025
01:40:36,963 --> 01:40:38,863
Through thick and thin...

1026
01:40:39,566 --> 01:40:41,329
Through happiness and sorrow...

1027
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:43,329
Through poverty and fortune...

1028
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,394
Till death do us apart...

1029
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:48,337
l will be yours forever.

1030
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:50,474
l will be yours forever.

1031
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:34,948
Hey, dimples.

1032
01:41:36,556 --> 01:41:38,080
What took you so long?

1033
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:34,371
My eyes

1034
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:36,177
My eyes

1035
01:42:36,216 --> 01:42:39,117
Why do l need them if not to see you?

1036
01:42:39,486 --> 01:42:40,851
My hands

1037
01:42:41,087 --> 01:42:42,554
My hands

1038
01:42:42,622 --> 01:42:45,921
Why do l need them
if not to touch you?

1039
01:42:46,226 --> 01:42:49,525
My heart beats to
the tune of these beautiful words

1040
01:42:49,563 --> 01:42:52,657
My youth sways to
the rhythm of these beautiful words

1041
01:42:52,899 --> 01:42:55,800
Even if you are in a faraway universe

1042
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:58,930
l'll come and find you

1043
01:42:59,105 --> 01:43:02,336
Let's get lost and become lovers

1044
01:43:02,442 --> 01:43:06,037
Let's get lost and become one soul

1045
01:43:06,112 --> 01:43:07,409
My eyes

1046
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:09,046
My eyes

1047
01:43:09,683 --> 01:43:12,584
Why do l need them if not to see you?

1048
01:43:12,819 --> 01:43:14,150
My hands

1049
01:43:14,387 --> 01:43:15,513
My hands

1050
01:43:16,156 --> 01:43:19,592
Why do l need them
if not to touch you?

1051
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:46,044
l crossed great rivers
l crossed great mountains

1052
01:43:46,253 --> 01:43:49,381
And l come with a heart filled with love
vast as the sky

1053
01:43:51,191 --> 01:43:54,456
l've crossed many fields
l've crossed many plains

1054
01:43:54,494 --> 01:43:58,794
And l come like a branch
sprouting new love for you

1055
01:43:59,099 --> 01:44:02,398
l come like the clouds
filled with lightning

1056
01:44:02,435 --> 01:44:05,734
l come and shower you with my love

1057
01:44:05,772 --> 01:44:08,240
l'll come and find you

1058
01:44:09,209 --> 01:44:11,677
Let's get lost and become lovers

1059
01:44:12,445 --> 01:44:15,972
Let's get burnt in the fire of love

1060
01:44:16,049 --> 01:44:17,346
My eyes

1061
01:44:17,884 --> 01:44:19,112
My eyes

1062
01:44:19,586 --> 01:44:22,453
Why do l need them if not to see you?

1063
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:24,118
My hands

1064
01:44:24,558 --> 01:44:25,684
My hands

1065
01:44:26,126 --> 01:44:29,562
Why do l need them
if not to touch you?

1066
01:44:59,659 --> 01:45:02,856
Even if it means changing my fate
And altering my destiny

1067
01:45:02,929 --> 01:45:06,160
l will come running to you

1068
01:45:07,934 --> 01:45:11,062
Even if l have to use
the last breath in my body

1069
01:45:11,271 --> 01:45:14,468
l will come running to you

1070
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:19,139
All l needed was you

1071
01:45:19,245 --> 01:45:22,476
All l needed was a miracle

1072
01:45:22,515 --> 01:45:25,746
l'll come and find you

1073
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:28,845
Let's get lost and become lovers

1074
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:32,823
Let's become each other's shadows

1075
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:34,349
My eyes

1076
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:35,990
My eyes

1077
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:38,661
Why do l need them if not to see you?

1078
01:45:39,633 --> 01:45:40,759
My hands

1079
01:45:41,267 --> 01:45:42,529
My hands

1080
01:45:42,969 --> 01:45:46,166
Why do l need them
if not to touch you?

1081
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:19,096
My queen!

1082
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:26,601
The unthinkable has happened!
Please come quickly!

1083
01:47:18,732 --> 01:47:20,927
Sarpini!

1084
01:47:22,135 --> 01:47:23,295
Foolish girl!

1085
01:47:23,737 --> 01:47:27,070
She thinks she can escape
from her roots so easily.

1086
01:47:27,407 --> 01:47:28,601
Sarpini!

1087
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:31,442
Send forth your snakes

1088
01:47:32,112 --> 01:47:35,513
and bring Priya back to me.

1089
01:47:48,294 --> 01:47:52,754
Yodha, l'm very happy
that you've found Priya!

1090
01:47:55,435 --> 01:47:58,370
l gave up my sight,
but l would have also given up my life

1091
01:47:58,438 --> 01:48:00,030
to hold these hands again.

1092
01:48:03,443 --> 01:48:04,535
Priya...

1093
01:48:05,211 --> 01:48:06,303
This is all my fault.

1094
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:14,352
l came into your life
and brought nothing but darkness.

1095
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,580
No, Priya.

1096
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:18,318
Don't say that.

1097
01:48:19,225 --> 01:48:21,125
Then it's also your responsibility
to brighten it up.

1098
01:48:21,494 --> 01:48:23,587
Yodha, when l offered to
restore your eyes, you refused.

1099
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:26,188
You didn't want to
see a world without Priya.

1100
01:48:26,232 --> 01:48:27,722
But now she is here.

1101
01:48:28,568 --> 01:48:29,694
Come.

1102
01:48:31,171 --> 01:48:32,263
Sit down.

1103
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:38,337
Close your eyes.

1104
01:48:39,646 --> 01:48:42,911
l want Priya to be the first thing l see.

1105
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:45,009
Oh, no! Snakes!

1106
01:49:57,557 --> 01:50:01,220
The only way to stop lrendri's menace
is by destroying her completely.

1107
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:04,788
Yodha, without my blood,
lrendri's strength will wane

1108
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:06,698
and she will eventually die.

1109
01:50:06,766 --> 01:50:08,961
We just need a safe place
to hide for a few days.

1110
01:50:09,002 --> 01:50:10,936
But what will happen to
the children and my son?

1111
01:50:10,970 --> 01:50:13,837
We need to go to Agartha
as soon as possible.

1112
01:50:14,874 --> 01:50:17,274
Then let's go to Agartha right away.

1113
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:24,647
There's just one night left
before the eclipse

1114
01:50:25,218 --> 01:50:27,152
and Priya has disappeared.

1115
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:31,254
Don't worry.
She can never escape from us.

1116
01:50:31,891 --> 01:50:33,153
Her scent.

1117
01:50:33,993 --> 01:50:35,290
l can smell her.

1118
01:50:35,695 --> 01:50:39,688
l see that she is heading to Agartha.

1119
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:41,658
Agartha?

1120
01:50:43,569 --> 01:50:44,627
lrendri!

1121
01:50:44,671 --> 01:50:47,697
You have had all the snakes
rise and attack the villagers!

1122
01:50:48,174 --> 01:50:50,005
This devil should be sent back to hell!

1123
01:50:50,043 --> 01:50:51,203
Burn her! Burn her!

1124
01:51:12,465 --> 01:51:16,162
You might be able to destroy
my mortal body now,

1125
01:51:16,202 --> 01:51:19,729
but you won't be able to stop me
when my vengeful soul returns!

1126
01:51:33,219 --> 01:51:37,087
The place where you were burnt alive
in your previous life

1127
01:51:37,724 --> 01:51:41,683
is where you shall be
resurrected in this life.

1128
01:51:41,728 --> 01:51:44,356
The snakes that were burnt with you

1129
01:51:44,397 --> 01:51:47,662
are waiting restlessly
beneath the ground

1130
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:49,759
and inviting you to return.

1131
01:51:50,303 --> 01:51:55,570
For you to resurrect, the Black Eye
must feed on Moksha's blood.

1132
01:52:02,181 --> 01:52:06,015
Each of these amulets contains
strands of Queen lrendri's hair.

1133
01:52:06,185 --> 01:52:09,712
They will turn into an enormous snake
as the lunar eclipse commences.

1134
01:52:10,089 --> 01:52:11,386
Begin the ceremony.

1135
01:52:24,570 --> 01:52:26,629
The time is near

1136
01:52:26,706 --> 01:52:28,833
The eclipse approaches

1137
01:52:28,941 --> 01:52:31,501
And death looms close

1138
01:52:37,717 --> 01:52:40,982
Mountains, valleys, rivers and forests
are to be crossed

1139
01:52:44,257 --> 01:52:47,590
Yet the thirst of the fire-spitting snake
has not been quenched

1140
01:52:50,696 --> 01:52:55,065
And the breath of life
has yet to reach the stricken children

1141
01:52:59,572 --> 01:53:03,531
And the vicious snake
must be defeated

1142
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:12,174
The superstitions
propagated by the priests

1143
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:18,622
Awaken an ancient serpent power

1144
01:53:21,327 --> 01:53:25,320
And the Black Eye thirsts
for Moksha's blood

1145
01:53:27,867 --> 01:53:31,633
The tortured soul will take
the shape of a catastrophe

1146
01:53:35,675 --> 01:53:38,906
The madness
exceeds all boundaries

1147
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:44,514
Unfettered evil is a sign
of total destruction

1148
01:53:47,687 --> 01:53:49,780
Your beliefs are flawed.

1149
01:53:50,323 --> 01:53:52,348
Your shrines are powerless.

1150
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:55,519
Your gods have run away.

1151
01:53:55,695 --> 01:54:00,029
l will only be satisfied
when you have all suffered like l have.

1152
01:54:01,033 --> 01:54:04,799
This devil needs to be vanquished

1153
01:54:05,304 --> 01:54:09,240
Hell shall quake with her arrival

1154
01:54:09,642 --> 01:54:13,601
The sound of victory
needs to be heard again

1155
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:18,147
This is a test for all righteousness

1156
01:54:18,184 --> 01:54:21,210
To banish the lurking evil forever

1157
01:54:21,654 --> 01:54:24,851
To this end began
Moksha's journey

1158
01:54:26,726 --> 01:54:29,217
Yodha, you are the protector!

1159
01:54:30,329 --> 01:54:33,162
Yodha, you are the savior!

1160
01:54:34,834 --> 01:54:35,960
There are lights inside the shrine.

1161
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:46,204
Be careful, my queen!

1162
01:54:49,882 --> 01:54:51,611
The eclipse is approaching.

1163
01:54:52,919 --> 01:54:56,047
l feel weak without Priya's blood.

1164
01:54:56,923 --> 01:55:00,518
Once Priya is here,
l promise to provide you with her blood.

1165
01:55:04,197 --> 01:55:06,188
The shrine looks empty.

1166
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:07,756
There's nobody here.

1167
01:55:08,501 --> 01:55:09,900
Yodha, look over there.

1168
01:55:15,441 --> 01:55:18,239
Are these cocoons
part of the village ritual?

1169
01:55:18,277 --> 01:55:19,744
l have never seen anything like this.

1170
01:55:19,779 --> 01:55:21,770
l think it's another of
the priest's crazy rituals.

1171
01:55:21,847 --> 01:55:23,314
The shell is soft, like a snake's egg.

1172
01:55:34,727 --> 01:55:36,285
Oh, my God!

1173
01:55:36,329 --> 01:55:37,921
What have they done to the children?

1174
01:55:41,067 --> 01:55:42,762
She is still breathing.

1175
01:55:45,438 --> 01:55:46,496
You take care of the children.

1176
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:18,860
Manju, bring Priya to me.

1177
01:56:31,617 --> 01:56:32,675
Moksha!

1178
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:40,217
Moksha!

1179
01:56:54,206 --> 01:56:57,175
Moksha, you hide here.
Let me go and look inside the shrine.

1180
01:57:36,182 --> 01:57:38,673
Have you gone mad, Manju?

1181
01:57:39,051 --> 01:57:41,952
All l need is one drop of blood.

1182
01:57:42,121 --> 01:57:45,887
After tonight, she is of no use to us.

1183
01:57:47,326 --> 01:57:49,590
Loyalty is not simply a matter
of bloodline, my queen,

1184
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:52,754
but a matter of faith.

1185
01:58:07,446 --> 01:58:08,777
Elixir!

1186
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:12,373
The potion that brings me life!

1187
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:55,891
Where is Priya?

1188
01:58:56,829 --> 01:58:59,957
Priya does not matter.
And neither will Moksha.

1189
01:59:01,767 --> 01:59:03,132
Don't be scared, Moksha.

1190
01:59:03,169 --> 01:59:05,103
Stand your ground
and face her with courage.

1191
01:59:05,137 --> 01:59:06,297
Moksha.

1192
01:59:07,072 --> 01:59:11,532
The prophecy that she is the messiah
will remain but a tale for children.

1193
01:59:11,877 --> 01:59:13,811
She will be forgotten forever.

1194
01:59:14,013 --> 01:59:18,575
The only power that shall prevail
will be that of the Black Eye.

1195
01:59:26,125 --> 01:59:28,150
You seem to have forgotten
history, lrendri.

1196
01:59:28,494 --> 01:59:30,394
The human spirit
has always triumphed,

1197
01:59:30,463 --> 01:59:32,192
be it over the devil or the divine!

1198
01:59:32,431 --> 01:59:34,262
Man's beliefs may sometimes be blind,

1199
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:36,900
but his determination is unbeatable.

1200
01:59:38,537 --> 01:59:40,903
And l swear by that determination!

1201
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:44,673
No matter what you do, lrendri,

1202
01:59:45,911 --> 01:59:50,007
l will destroy you once and for all
before the eclipse ends.

1203
01:59:50,583 --> 01:59:51,709
Sarpini!

1204
01:59:52,017 --> 01:59:57,011
Take my body and make it yours.
Kill this foolish warrior.

1205
02:00:26,819 --> 02:00:29,287
Yodha, this is because of the eclipse.

1206
02:00:29,355 --> 02:00:32,586
The lunar eclipse is known to
strengthen demonic powers.

1207
02:00:33,259 --> 02:00:34,590
Have no fear.

1208
02:00:34,627 --> 02:00:36,288
Go and take care of the children.

1209
02:00:37,229 --> 02:00:38,890
-Leave now.
-Moksha, let's go.

1210
02:02:55,501 --> 02:02:56,661
Moksha!

1211
02:03:00,372 --> 02:03:01,430
Let me go.

1212
02:03:05,444 --> 02:03:06,604
Let me go.

1213
02:03:10,449 --> 02:03:14,545
With your blood,
lrendri shall become immortal.

1214
02:03:14,586 --> 02:03:17,282
This altar shall serve as the right spot
for your sacrifice.

1215
02:05:54,313 --> 02:05:55,905
-Moksha.
-Yodha.

1216
02:06:08,894 --> 02:06:10,088
Priya.

1217
02:06:10,529 --> 02:06:12,793
The serpent power is calling out to you.

1218
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:15,758
lt wants you to become its master.

1219
02:06:16,168 --> 02:06:19,467
You are my granddaughter,
a true blood witch.

1220
02:06:19,538 --> 02:06:20,937
Become my successor.

1221
02:06:23,175 --> 02:06:24,301
Priya!

1222
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:29,611
Evil can do without succession.

1223
02:06:30,983 --> 02:06:32,780
l will die a thousand deaths.

1224
02:06:33,719 --> 02:06:37,246
But l'll never let
the Black Eye rule this world.

1225
02:06:42,794 --> 02:06:43,886
Priya!

1226
02:06:44,930 --> 02:06:45,988
Priya!

1227
02:06:46,131 --> 02:06:48,361
Priya. Priya...

1228
02:06:50,302 --> 02:06:52,236
No matter how powerful you are,

1229
02:06:54,139 --> 02:06:59,042
the greatest power lies in
making the choice to be righteous.

1230
02:06:59,645 --> 02:07:02,705
lf you haven't understood this
in two lifetimes,

1231
02:07:02,781 --> 02:07:05,045
you never will, lrendri.

1232
02:07:05,117 --> 02:07:07,950
Moksha, fulfill your duty.

1233
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:08,837
My son!

1234
02:08:16,221 --> 02:08:20,123
From then on,
the teardrop-shaped land

1235
02:08:20,492 --> 02:08:22,426
was filled with joy and happiness

1236
02:08:22,494 --> 02:08:27,022
like the sweet laughter of children.

1237
02:08:28,022 --> 02:12:27,022
