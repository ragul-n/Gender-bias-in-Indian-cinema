Re-synched by Polestar

2
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,034
Man has to face many storms in life.

3
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:53,443
But this orphan has
to face another storm.

4
00:00:55,422 --> 00:01:00,420
And that is his
helplessness, his weakness.

5
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,495
And sense of loneliness.

6
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:08,289
What are you doing here by yourself?

7
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:14,532
Somebody definitely comes
to meet or take home all the kids.

8
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:17,313
But nobody comes to meet me
or to take me home.

9
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:20,065
Don't l have anyone in this world?

10
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:25,185
Yes, my son. Those who have nobody...

11
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,832
He belongs to them.

12
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,427
- Pass the ball.
- He's lame. He can't.

13
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:23,523
You cripple! Can't you hear?
Pass the ball!

14
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,401
Not only deaf is he lame,
he's also deaf!

15
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:32,066
- He won't understand like this.
- Then how will he?

16
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,777
Now let us see you walk.

17
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:43,008
l'll show you! Calling him lame?

18
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:54,946
Thank you pal. You helped me
a lot. What's your name?

19
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,305
Akash Verma. And yours?

20
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,146
From today Akash and
Aman are friends.

21
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,456
See what l have for you.

22
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:35,329
This looks imported.
Must be expensive.

23
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:37,984
That's not your concern. You eat it.

24
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,273
- What's in your hand?
- A 10 paise sweet.

25
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,377
- Give it to me. l like it.
- What are you doing?

26
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:48,321
That was for me, l ate it.
This is for you so you eat it.

27
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:59,040
Let go! What are you doing?

28
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,920
You're always up to something!
What if somebody sees you?

29
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:04,898
So what? l'll ask them for permission

30
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,692
Mister Viewer, can l romance my wife?

31
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:13,569
l've got used to asking for permission

32
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:17,122
First ask you if l could romance
you then your parents to marry you.

33
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:18,561
Then the priest to get us married.

34
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:21,088
A year later take permission from
our son, put him in the cradle...

35
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,098
And ask can l go to her?

36
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:28,623
When we first met, it felt
as if you didn't have a tongue!

37
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:29,984
l still don't.

38
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,249
- Now it's 100 parrots on one side
and you on the other! - Parrots?

39
00:04:33,535 --> 00:04:37,891
Who will believe that you are Rajiv
Verma, the owner of Verma Estates?

40
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:39,808
The father of a 12 year old boy.

41
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:43,682
That reminds me where is our son?

42
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,562
Gone to meet his friend.

43
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,768
Since he found this new friend
he has forgotten his old pal.

44
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:56,641
Dad this is my best friend Aman.

45
00:05:01,246 --> 00:05:04,802
Where do you live son?
What do your parents do?

46
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:08,386
l have nobody.
l live with Father D'mello.

47
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,592
No Dad, he's lying!
In this world l am his!

48
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:19,426
lf you love him so do we!

49
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,463
Never say that you have nobody.

50
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,416
Didn't you bring Aman?

51
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,873
- He refused to come.
- Refused?

52
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:26,144
Where are you going?

53
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,295
Let him go.

54
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:33,219
What we adults couldn't do,
Akash's love will do.

55
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,161
- Will you come or not?
- l will.

56
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:16,897
- What's going on?
- l'm looking for a coin l lost.

57
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:20,098
- Acting smart with me?
- Honest. But what are you doing?

58
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,353
He's asking me! l'm looking
for a 50 paise coin l dropped.

59
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:39,231
What is going on?

60
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:43,010
He lost 25 paise and l lost 50.
We were looking for them.

61
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:45,729
Come out. l'll find the coins.

62
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,736
- Let go my ear.
- First get up.

63
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:51,231
Someday he'll get me thrashed!

64
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:56,610
The kid is bad enough but
the Dad takes the cake!

65
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,784
By god! l'm terrible.

66
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:01,664
l'm getting fired thanks to you!

67
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:03,584
No, l got fired because of you!

68
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:21,891
Did you alone win all
these cups and shields?

69
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:29,862
What's terrific about it?
It's thanks to your blessings.

70
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:34,755
He is always terrific but ask
your useless son what he has brought.

71
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,787
What did l say? l knew
Mummy would ask this question.

72
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:40,672
But l haven't come empty-handed.

73
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:43,618
lf Aman has brought a cup,
l have brought a plate.

74
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,715
- Now answer me!
- See how cheeky you son is!

75
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:49,986
Aman has brought a cup and he a plate!

76
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:57,025
Tell her l'm 24 years old!

77
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:01,602
Forgive him this time. Next time
he does something, beat him not me.

78
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:03,520
Here's the plate.
Please get some tea.

79
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:08,097
- You'll never change.
- You'll get me thrashed!

80
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:12,098
- You've spoilt him thoroughly!
- Daddy, your dialogue.

81
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,458
Does love spoil anyone?

82
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,049
l love you too. Are you spoilt?

83
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:20,064
The kids are watching. Have shame!

84
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:32,354
The loyal and eflicient workers
of Verma Constructions.

85
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,898
Today l introduce you to my sons.

86
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,417
This is Aman.

87
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,288
- And this is...
- l am Akash,

88
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:53,409
- Okay carry on.
- What's left to say?

89
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:57,280
l forgot what l had to say.

90
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,972
You have encourage me so far.

91
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:07,137
To strengthen our foundation.
After today...

92
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,177
Help these boys in the same manner.

93
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,761
This is the oflice of
Varma Constructions.

94
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,530
- How is it?
- Very nice but what will l do here?

95
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:27,074
Here's a telephone.
You have fingers.

96
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,658
There are girls in town.
Call them up and have fun.

97
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,217
Can l really?

98
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:38,143
What are you doing?

99
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,562
l had heard about angels.

100
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:49,317
Never seen them but today l can say
confidently they're just like you.

101
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:51,104
What have we done?

102
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:55,587
The honor you've given me
by giving me your name...

103
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,450
That's a debt that l can never repay.

104
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,298
You call our love a debt?

105
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:06,913
Why do you talk of debt,
Ioan, obligations?

106
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:10,818
l've never considered you
any different from Akash.

107
00:12:11,423 --> 00:12:13,504
Of course. You think he's
intelligent while l'm a fool!

108
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,321
And that's right. No.

109
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:20,739
We have to attend a party.
But you won't go anywhere.

110
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:28,769
- Where are you going?
- To meet these.

111
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,448
- What's this?
- List of girls.

112
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,496
Rita at 12, Sita at 2.

113
00:12:34,815 --> 00:12:37,954
Meeta at 4, and somebody at 6.

114
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,056
And when l return home at 8,
my Dad gives me a spanking!

115
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,065
Your list is driving me mad.

116
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:47,584
Okay, should l move?

117
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:50,112
- Today is the first day of oflice.
- That is true.

118
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,473
- Okay, should l move?
- If Dad calls?

119
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:57,603
Then l'll be in trouble.
Okay, should l move?

120
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:00,289
What if you're needed in the oflice?

121
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,160
Okay, should l move?

122
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,617
- Please go ahead.
- Okay, l'm off.

123
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:10,210
The heart is at peace
by a glimpse of you.

124
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,569
The enemy of my peace is back!

125
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:32,736
What is it?

126
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,817
Come on.

127
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:37,471
Finally found time?

128
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:46,820
l had so many business appointments
since morning that l'm tired.

129
00:19:47,456 --> 00:19:49,153
Only now l've found time
for Menaka darling.

130
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:52,002
Let's go out. We'll freak out.

131
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,898
No, l'm exhausted.
l'm feeling sleepy.

132
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:01,474
Go to bed. This isn't your cup of tea!

133
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,032
That's a funny friend you have.

134
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:08,739
Why didn't he come with us?
Said he's tired and sleepy.

135
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:11,041
- Neither is he tired nor sleepy.
- Meaning?

136
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:14,850
l know him very well.
He must be reading something.

137
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:19,139
- You mean it was an excuse.
- To get rid of us.

138
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,754
Because he's not
interested in anything.

139
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:24,447
Not even in pretty girls?

140
00:20:24,896 --> 00:20:27,523
Girls? He runs miles away from them.

141
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,569
He's a modern Viswamitra.

142
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,385
lf l disturb his penance...?

143
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:35,299
l'll throw a grand party
for you and your friends!

144
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:49,635
- What's this?
- A picture and this for real.

145
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:54,147
- l'm busy and Akash isn't here.
- l know that.

146
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:59,780
But what do l do? Since l set
eyes on you, l see only you!

147
00:21:00,703 --> 00:21:02,978
You misunderstand me.

148
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,568
l'm not interested in these things.

149
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,019
l know that you're the
modern Viswamitra.

150
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,320
But my name is Menaka.

151
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,233
And l've come to
disrupt your penance.

152
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,131
Considering that you're Akash's
friend, l'm asking you to leave.

153
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:21,729
And if l don't go?

154
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,577
l'll have you thrown out of here.

155
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:26,368
You can't do that.

156
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:33,984
What do you think of me?

157
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:37,409
There's no place in my heart
for society girls like you!

158
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:40,353
Don't ever try to come here again!

159
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:44,034
Even my foot won't come to you!

160
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:47,106
Have you ever seen your face?
l got talked into a bet.

161
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:49,793
Otherwise a man like you
only deserves pity not love!

162
00:21:50,303 --> 00:21:53,666
You snubbed a pretty girl like me!

163
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,481
That is why God has rendered
one of your legs useless!

164
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:59,522
lf l had my way,
l'd break the other leg too!

165
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:04,002
You're a beggar living off others
in addition to being a cripple!

166
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,353
I've bet you to win his heart, 
not to break it!

167
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:22,432
You've insulted my friend! l'll...

168
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:26,144
What are you doing? Are you mad?

169
00:22:26,431 --> 00:22:29,634
- Take her out of my sight!
- Let's go before something happens.

170
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:54,178
Forgive me. Menaka has
been punished for her deeds.

171
00:22:55,423 --> 00:22:56,704
lt's not your fault.

172
00:22:59,551 --> 00:23:01,473
lt's that bitter truth of my life...

173
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:04,961
...that l'm used to living with.

174
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:09,730
Time will tell whether
l'm an ember or a dew drop.

175
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:13,154
At the moment l'm a tear
glistening on the lashes of time.

176
00:23:13,951 --> 00:23:17,475
Exquisite, l swear by poetry.

177
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:21,955
At this tender age,
such thoughts, such depths.

178
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:25,954
This upliftment. l swear...

179
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:29,058
Every word of your poems...

180
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:32,803
... stings the heart like a dagger.

181
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:40,614
But l don't understand in spite of
being the loved poet of thousands..

182
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:43,618
Why are you a stranger to them?

183
00:23:44,447 --> 00:23:47,137
Why don't you let people know that...

184
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:51,779
The one rising like the tide in
their hearts is none other than you!

185
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,994
No, l can't do this.

186
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,808
Let it remain a secret.

187
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:04,740
- But why? - l'd like my feelings
to reach every corner of the world.

188
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:07,970
But l'm scared to
come before the world.

189
00:24:09,343 --> 00:24:13,059
lf mother, Dad or Akash
feel my pain in my songs...

190
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
They will be very hurt.

191
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:19,651
They might feel there was
something lacking in my upbringing.

192
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,323
l can give up my life for them.

193
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,752
But l can't hurt them.

194
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,650
l live for them not myself.

195
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:37,316
Great! Not only are you a good
poet but also a good human being.

196
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:41,410
You embarrass me.

197
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,896
Let's get down to business.

198
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:48,193
According to your instructions...

199
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:53,475
l send all the royalty
earned by your books to...

200
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:55,713
Father D'mello's orphanage.

201
00:24:56,191 --> 00:25:00,996
These are some letters and fan mail.

202
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:04,611
The rest is ordinary but...

203
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:09,858
This is very special.
She seems a devoted fan.

204
00:25:10,464 --> 00:25:13,538
She is always requesting me
for your songs, your poems.

205
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:17,507
And her name is Miss Pooja.

206
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,809
l will fulfill her request.

207
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,337
l swear by poetry.

208
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:49,730
The name that l have earned
by singing your songs...

209
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:54,371
...is truly yours because the
words were from your treasury.

210
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:59,235
l'm sending you a cutting of the
picture of me receiving the prize.

211
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:08,288
And a gift for you.

212
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:37,090
Received your letter.
Was happy to read its contents.

213
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,553
l've kept my word and
sent you my new poem.

214
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,523
Hope you like it.
If you don't, don't hesitate.

215
00:30:44,096 --> 00:30:45,761
Let me know so l can write even better

216
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:59,779
The blank frame hanging in my house
and l await for your photograph.

217
00:31:09,631 --> 00:31:11,201
You snubbed a pretty girl like me!

218
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:13,921
That is why God has rendered
one of your legs useless.

219
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:16,962
lf l could, l'd break your other leg!

220
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:21,154
Not only are you a cripple,
you're a beggar who lives off others!

221
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:24,833
The Sagar (ocean) of my joy.
The Sagar of my imagination.

222
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:29,156
Every word written by you
sends my heart racing.

223
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,410
Your words woven with
pearls are my very life

224
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:37,410
l pray to God that you keep writing.

225
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:47,809
Today your face is extra bright.

226
00:31:48,352 --> 00:31:49,857
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

227
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,570
Looks like you're a victim of love.

228
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:56,834
With you around
anything can happen to me.

229
00:31:57,376 --> 00:32:01,604
- Why? - Because you have
the world rights for love.

230
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:06,788
You're talking to me but
your eyes are on that girl.

231
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:10,145
She looks as smooth as a duck!

232
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:17,221
l'll enjoy it when the mountain
sitting next to her falls on you.

233
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,835
You're talking of the mountain?
l'm thinking of cuddling up!

234
00:32:23,872 --> 00:32:24,704
That mountain?

235
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:28,835
No, the girl. The little hillock.

236
00:32:29,151 --> 00:32:31,810
Son then you're in for a lashing.

237
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,849
And if l hug her, you'll pay the bill.

238
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:37,601
Or l'll pay. Fine?

239
00:32:48,287 --> 00:32:50,594
What are you doing?

240
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:56,485
- l'm blind.
- Take him to the toilet.

241
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:04,131
Poor boy. He's blind.

242
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,272
He's had it.

243
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,138
Get dinner fast.
Or l'll have to eat a punch.

244
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,185
What a lively boy.

245
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,002
Seeing them together l'm
reminded of the film, -Dosti'

246
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,107
One chap is lame and the other blind.

247
00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:50,305
- Who is blind?
- That boy on that table.

248
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:54,083
He's Akash Verma. He'll become
anything to flirt with girls.

249
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,392
He fooled me!

250
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:01,824
See how l'll teach him a lesson.

251
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,657
Forget business. Talk about home.

252
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:17,891
- About children.
- My children are great.

253
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:20,513
lf one of my sons is a diamond,
the other is the Kohinoor diamond!

254
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,778
How do you differentiate between them?

255
00:34:24,224 --> 00:34:25,825
How do l tell them apart?

256
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,961
Hear and decide for yourself.
Take Aman for example.

257
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:32,739
A turbulent mind
becomes calm at seeing him.

258
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:35,617
When he speaks it feels as if
rose petals fall from his lips.

259
00:34:36,064 --> 00:34:38,946
Great! Then why don't
you open a flower shop?

260
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:43,266
l also want to start a shoe shop.
No place. Shall l use your head?

261
00:34:43,552 --> 00:34:46,531
Don't be angry. The other son?

262
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:54,311
Akash will write the name
of Varmas in the sky with light.

263
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,321
He will add light to our family name.

264
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,289
He's a dark horse.

265
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:08,451
l mean he'll run ahead of everybody.

266
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:15,682
He'll keep running with
the world behind him.

267
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:17,729
He'll keep running so will people.

268
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:25,410
Stop the car.

269
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,681
He's really running
like a horse in a race.

270
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,617
He's ahead with people behind him!

271
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,946
Tomatoes instead of flowers.
Stones instead of love!

272
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:48,865
Sticks instead of reward!

273
00:35:49,824 --> 00:35:51,552
What about our family name?

274
00:35:58,401 --> 00:36:01,859
- What happened to your family name?
- Nothing. Get off the car.

275
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:04,290
- He's getting a beating and l have
to alight? - Get off quickly!

276
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:05,792
How will l go home?

277
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,899
- Take a cab.
- Cabs don't go there.

278
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:11,458
- Then take a rickshaw.
- How will that go if cabs don't?

279
00:36:11,776 --> 00:36:12,865
Take your legs and go!

280
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:16,994
- l hold your legs.
- Not on hire, out!

281
00:36:23,488 --> 00:36:26,530
What's wrong with him? He's getting
beaten and l have to get off!

282
00:36:26,975 --> 00:36:28,192
Use your legs!

283
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:31,810
l'm ashamed of your condition.
Feel like drowning myself!

284
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,216
Why are you sounding link a man?

285
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,539
- What is it? - You're on the
phone when l'm scolding you!

286
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,905
There's no respect!

287
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:42,818
How did this tear?
Why did you get beaten up?

288
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,050
You won't understand.
l'd gone for a fancy dress party.

289
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:48,673
And those fools
thought l was a beggar!

290
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,801
Do l really look that foolish?

291
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:55,233
- Not that much.
- What? - Why?

292
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:59,618
Beggars are given charity, not
beaten by tomatoes, eggs, stones!

293
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:05,380
- How do you know?
- l was passing by. l saw you chased.

294
00:37:06,465 --> 00:37:07,969
Long live fathers of today!

295
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:11,234
- Didn't try to rescue me!
- Me rescue you?

296
00:37:12,095 --> 00:37:13,888
So that people leave you
and beat me up instead?

297
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,275
- Should have iced him there!
- l'm not ice cream to be frozen!

298
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:20,771
- l'll give you one!
- The father within awakens!

299
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,394
The one outside not within!

300
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:29,284
Forgive him now. l promise you
he'll never repeat it again.

301
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,905
l swear by my Dad l won't do it.

302
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,505
- Sure?
- Sure.

303
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:34,976
Must be Julie.

304
00:37:35,647 --> 00:37:39,236
This telephone is the reason
he's getting spoilt!

305
00:37:39,647 --> 00:37:42,979
You're right. If l get this
line cut, all his lines will be cut!

306
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,288
Ass! Donkey!

307
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:49,668
Whatever l am, however l am,
l am only your son.

308
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,433
My business partner.

309
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:02,531
My son Aman. We're building
a big hotel in Ooty with him.

310
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:04,641
The entire construction
responsibility is yours.

311
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:10,053
- Me? - The cold climate
of Ooty has affected him.

312
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:12,033
lt's not that.

313
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:15,330
l'm not sure whether
l can handle it well...

314
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:17,985
l am confident you will.

315
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,281
- When do l have to leave?
- When does the flight leave?

316
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:23,586
- Tomorrow.
- Is it your Pop's flight?

317
00:38:24,224 --> 00:38:26,402
lt leaves on Monday.
When will you reach?

318
00:38:26,624 --> 00:38:27,361
ln 4 days.

319
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,459
My other son. Listen to me..

320
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,029
- Why are you looking there?
- l've seen him somewhere.

321
00:38:37,376 --> 00:38:40,226
ln some party or restaurant.
l'm the life of every party.

322
00:38:40,544 --> 00:38:42,145
l'm always followed by thousands.

323
00:38:44,384 --> 00:38:45,793
One in front followed by thousands!

324
00:38:46,144 --> 00:38:48,290
A dark...

325
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,457
- Let me say horse.
- Doesn't sound nice from an ass.

326
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:55,363
- Go home! - First you say come
to office, then you say go home!

327
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:00,577
Are you making fun of my son?

328
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:03,714
Let your son do anything,
l'll have it printed in the papers!

329
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,594
- l don't have a son.
- Then who was in your house?

330
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:09,219
- The neighbor's son.
- And that woman in your house?

331
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,465
She is my wife.

332
00:39:11,936 --> 00:39:14,594
Any problems? Go do your work.

333
00:39:15,743 --> 00:39:19,202
Laxmi will come to pick
you up from the airport.

334
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,057
He'll tell you the rest.

335
00:39:32,031 --> 00:39:33,056
Since when are you here?

336
00:39:33,312 --> 00:39:39,205
- And before this?
- l was in Vellore.

337
00:39:40,192 --> 00:39:44,547
- How did you come here?
- What happened...

338
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,625
l once had a picture taken.

339
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:51,524
The positive appeared negative.

340
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:56,003
The photographer told me...

341
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:59,874
You'll become an ape in Vellore.

342
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:11,842
- Can you cook well?
- Yes sir.

343
00:40:12,224 --> 00:40:15,779
My parents were good cooks.

344
00:40:16,224 --> 00:40:21,796
Once you eat food cooked by me
you'll lick your fingers.

345
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:30,981
You cook very well.
You should join a 5 star hotel.

346
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,985
You're pulling my leg.
Here, wash your hands.

347
00:40:35,872 --> 00:40:38,017
- Is there any good market nearby?
- Sure.

348
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:40,001
Just 5 minutes away.

349
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:42,145
- What do you get there?
- Shoes.

350
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:45,698
- What nonsense!
- Listen to the rest.

351
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,378
Shoes, clothes, fruits, everything.

352
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:51,521
What do you want?

353
00:40:52,672 --> 00:40:53,665
l want some books.

354
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,546
- Is there any book stall?
- Book and stall too.

355
00:40:56,864 --> 00:40:58,945
- The owner is incomparable.
- What do you mean?

356
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:03,107
Her name is Pooja, but deeds othewise.

357
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,329
Are you responsible for everybody?

358
00:41:20,064 --> 00:41:22,241
Then why did you pay the rent
for Asha's shop?

359
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:24,609
That gangster was troubling her.

360
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:27,362
l thought you'd be happy
we could help somebody.

361
00:41:27,648 --> 00:41:33,316
But l get scared when you
start preaching to a hoodlum.

362
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,290
You make a mountain out of a molehill.

363
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:39,074
Pass me the books. l'll put them away

364
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,129
Do you have the latest Newsweek?

365
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:53,825
Sure. Come in.

366
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,752
Mother! Pass the books.

367
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:14,176
A little more space.

368
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:43,874
She's much more
beautiful than l imagined!

369
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:47,842
- Did you say something?
- No.

370
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:53,092
l want some editions of poets.

371
00:42:54,112 --> 00:43:00,902
lf you won't feel hurt may l say
something? Everyone has his choice.

372
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:06,340
But have you ever read Sagar's work?

373
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:08,736
Who the hell is he?

374
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:12,419
Haven't you heard of him?
He's a famous poet of these times.

375
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,074
l'm sure you'll like his work.

376
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:18,657
What can these poets of today write!

377
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:24,708
They steal drops from the works of
famous poets and become oceans!

378
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,578
No knowledge of the sound of
anklets yet write about it!

379
00:43:34,304 --> 00:43:37,475
l won't take it lightly if
you speak one word against Sagar!

380
00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:40,579
- What will you do?
- l won't give these books.

381
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,194
Looks like you...
What's the poet's name?

382
00:43:44,704 --> 00:43:48,644
Looks like you like him too much.

383
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,874
Yes l do! None of your business!

384
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,521
l mean you are flying off
the handle for no reason.

385
00:43:55,776 --> 00:43:58,498
l take back my words.
Now give me the books.

386
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,179
lf Sagar's new edition
is included in this...?

387
00:44:07,584 --> 00:44:08,800
Then you'll even get a discount!

388
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:13,633
How much is the bill
after deducting the discount?

389
00:44:14,241 --> 00:44:16,963
Rupees 40 for the books,
10 as discount. That's 30.

390
00:44:27,776 --> 00:44:29,410
Seems new to our city.

391
00:44:30,624 --> 00:44:34,467
- Looks like a stranger.
- An interesting stranger.

392
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,706
You don't know Sagar?
He's a famous poet of these times.

393
00:44:41,184 --> 00:44:43,265
l'm sure you will like his work.

394
00:44:52,545 --> 00:44:54,978
But why are you laughing?

395
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:57,090
l'm laughing because you're laughing.

396
00:44:58,049 --> 00:44:59,105
lt's great fun!

397
00:45:01,248 --> 00:45:02,561
The phone is ringing.

398
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,674
lt's the door.

399
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:18,820
- Who is it?
- Somebody from Bombay for you.

400
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,062
- When did you come?
- This morning.

401
00:45:25,664 --> 00:45:29,924
- How are mother, Dad, Akash?
- Fine. They miss you.

402
00:45:30,976 --> 00:45:34,370
- l too miss them.
- Hope you have no problems here.

403
00:45:35,264 --> 00:45:38,340
lf he has any problems,
l'll sort it out.

404
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:41,345
l have a very long name.

405
00:45:47,616 --> 00:45:50,370
- Get some tea for him.
- In a minute.

406
00:45:51,136 --> 00:45:52,512
Now who has come!

407
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:57,154
There are some maps and papers in this

408
00:45:57,696 --> 00:45:59,425
See them and try to understand.

409
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:24,931
Good day sir. Come in and sit.

410
00:46:30,272 --> 00:46:32,450
How can l serve you?

411
00:46:33,536 --> 00:46:38,340
- Get me first class tea.
- We don't serve it.

412
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,512
Then do you serve third class tea?

413
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:44,451
We serve no class of tea.
We only have...

414
00:46:51,424 --> 00:46:54,210
Does every tea here carry Ram's name?

415
00:46:54,496 --> 00:46:57,602
Yes. What is that sir?

416
00:47:00,032 --> 00:47:05,958
l'm Bajrangbali's devotee.
You tell me whose devotee he was.

417
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,461
- Ram's. - Yes.
That's why tea carries his name!

418
00:47:11,936 --> 00:47:13,698
So get me one Rampyari.

419
00:47:14,144 --> 00:47:17,859
Get one Rampyari for sir.

420
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,449
Can l get a paper and pen?

421
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:33,697
Here you are.

422
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,243
- One tea.
- Get a tea for sir.

423
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,986
So back on the same path?

424
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:23,617
To the same destination?

425
00:49:24,384 --> 00:49:26,337
Who are you?

426
00:49:27,777 --> 00:49:30,723
l'm your reflection, your conscience.

427
00:49:32,096 --> 00:49:36,645
l want to bring what's in
your heart to your tongue.

428
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:41,381
That you love Pooja intensely.

429
00:49:42,367 --> 00:49:45,539
And that love for her has
created a storm in your heart.

430
00:49:46,656 --> 00:49:48,353
And your heart has accepted her.

431
00:49:48,928 --> 00:49:54,244
You worshipped her and now
she's the purpose of your life.

432
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,864
You are right.

433
00:49:57,983 --> 00:49:59,329
l love her too much.

434
00:50:00,544 --> 00:50:03,619
Then why don't you tell her?

435
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:06,561
Some day l will.

436
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:09,314
l'll tell her l'm her Sagar!

437
00:50:12,864 --> 00:50:14,080
Have some sweets dear.

438
00:50:14,944 --> 00:50:19,364
- What for?
- Because my shop is doing very well.

439
00:50:19,776 --> 00:50:21,217
Really? How come?

440
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:23,361
- Thanks to you.
- Thanks to me?

441
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:26,722
A stranger comes to my shop everyday.

442
00:50:26,976 --> 00:50:29,569
And drinks 30-40 cups
of tea by evening.

443
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:31,201
How am l involved?

444
00:50:31,488 --> 00:50:34,530
Actually his eyes are on your shop.

445
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,577
Eyes here, tea there.

446
00:50:36,928 --> 00:50:40,483
And the total rupees 30.25

447
00:50:41,376 --> 00:50:45,059
So this is the matter!
Let that 30.25 come.

448
00:50:45,568 --> 00:50:47,522
l'll teach him such a lesson
that he'll forget to drink tea!

449
00:50:47,872 --> 00:50:49,954
Then what about my business?

450
00:50:50,337 --> 00:50:53,539
Don't worry. Call me when he comes.

451
00:50:53,856 --> 00:50:56,611
That l'll do but keep
the honor of these sweets.

452
00:50:57,024 --> 00:51:00,355
Lord! What difficulty
have you gotten me into!

453
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:07,811
What have l done!
Ruined my own business!

454
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,523
Lord! Save this foolish man!

455
00:51:11,872 --> 00:51:15,651
- How are you?
- The Lord is kind.

456
00:51:20,865 --> 00:51:23,139
The stranger has come!

457
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:30,946
So what's the latest news?

458
00:51:33,952 --> 00:51:37,283
l've heard the weather
outside is terrible!

459
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:41,027
Dark clouds are gathering.

460
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,482
Clouds are going to burst.

461
00:51:45,088 --> 00:51:46,786
Lightning is going to strike.

462
00:51:47,457 --> 00:51:49,954
There are chances of terrible rain!

463
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:07,458
Great! Exceptional!

464
00:52:07,905 --> 00:52:11,171
Listen to what Sagar says.

465
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:14,722
A picture is painted
in my heart since ages.

466
00:52:15,648 --> 00:52:21,158
My destiny sits in
the shade of your tresses.

467
00:52:22,176 --> 00:52:23,521
That book stall girl was right.

468
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:36,993
Listen to what else he has written.

469
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:42,532
As far as my vision..

470
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:45,698
l see only you, just you.

471
00:52:46,591 --> 00:52:47,649
l see you every moment.

472
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:52,708
lt's only the jeweller who
knows the value of the diamond.

473
00:52:54,912 --> 00:52:59,461
l'm reciting Sagar's poems to you
and you're not concentrating.

474
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:03,204
l meant to ask which
era did he write in?

475
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,306
- And where does he live?
- in my own city.

476
00:53:07,169 --> 00:53:09,474
And because of that l do meet him.

477
00:53:10,496 --> 00:53:13,315
lt's after coming here
that l learnt he writes well.

478
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,457
Didn't you know before that?

479
00:53:15,872 --> 00:53:19,620
That's a sign of greatness.
They never proclaim their greatness.

480
00:53:20,577 --> 00:53:23,395
Sagar, you turned out to
be deeper than the ocean!

481
00:53:24,191 --> 00:53:28,868
Now when l meet you,
l'll kiss your hand and say..

482
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:31,939
What will you say?

483
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,713
You are great!

484
00:53:36,737 --> 00:53:39,587
One fantastic Rampyari for him from me

485
00:53:40,511 --> 00:53:43,650
- Why the formality?
- Because you know Sagar.

486
00:53:43,905 --> 00:53:45,986
You belong to the same city,
you move in the same circles.

487
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,129
And l'm his fan.

488
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:54,629
lf you know Sagar, why did you
abuse him in my shop?

489
00:53:56,224 --> 00:53:58,401
l wanted to test the
limits of your love.

490
00:53:59,104 --> 00:54:00,641
By the way how do you know him?

491
00:54:01,024 --> 00:54:02,561
Through letters and his poems.

492
00:54:05,056 --> 00:54:06,433
Tell me something else about him.

493
00:54:07,104 --> 00:54:08,353
Ask me something else about him.

494
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:13,220
- How does he look?
- He's smart and young.

495
00:54:13,504 --> 00:54:17,316
Really? Can't you
introduce me to him?

496
00:54:17,728 --> 00:54:21,187
Definitely but on one condition.

497
00:54:24,096 --> 00:54:27,876
That you'll show me
this beautiful place.

498
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:31,331
Because l'm new to this area.

499
00:54:31,808 --> 00:54:32,993
ls that all?

500
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:34,784
So it's a promise?

501
00:59:48,032 --> 00:59:51,331
Mother, this is Aman.

502
00:59:55,104 --> 00:59:56,705
Have you come here for sight seeing?

503
00:59:57,216 --> 01:00:00,579
My Dad is constructing a hotel
here. l'm here in that regard.

504
01:00:01,951 --> 01:00:06,660
What a fool l am! l forgot to
tell you he knows Sagar very well.

505
01:00:07,232 --> 01:00:08,417
Now you're in deep trouble!

506
01:00:08,928 --> 01:00:10,914
- l don't understand.
- Neither do l.

507
01:00:11,584 --> 01:00:13,922
God knows why she is crazy for him!

508
01:00:15,008 --> 01:00:18,692
Now she'll drive you mad
talking about Sagar all the time!

509
01:00:19,488 --> 01:00:22,851
You've started off again!
l'll show you our house.

510
01:00:28,831 --> 01:00:29,890
This is Billu's room.

511
01:00:30,912 --> 01:00:33,441
That's mother's room.
And there's our prayer room.

512
01:00:34,496 --> 01:00:36,258
And that's the guest room.

513
01:00:41,184 --> 01:00:44,194
And this is my room.

514
01:00:52,097 --> 01:00:53,473
See the view from here.

515
01:00:54,592 --> 01:00:56,194
Everything looks so beautiful.

516
01:00:59,841 --> 01:01:02,691
Yes, it's truly beautiful.

517
01:01:03,968 --> 01:01:08,196
lf Kashmir is heaven on earth,
this place is our heaven!

518
01:01:09,312 --> 01:01:12,739
This place has made me
forget heaven on earth!

519
01:01:26,592 --> 01:01:28,482
You're wondering why
the frame is blank.

520
01:01:29,856 --> 01:01:32,675
This frame is waiting
for Sagar's photograph.

521
01:01:40,545 --> 01:01:44,068
Your wait is over.
Sagar has come in person.

522
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:51,329
Pooja here.

523
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:55,459
How did you think of me
so early in the morning?

524
01:01:56,064 --> 01:01:58,626
- To remind you of this evening.
- Anything special?

525
01:01:59,168 --> 01:02:03,236
That's why l called. There's a grand
show at Nehru Stadium this evening.

526
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,186
l'm also taking part in it.

527
01:02:05,825 --> 01:02:11,205
- Then l will definitely come.
- Don't be late. l'll be waiting.

528
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:17,893
l didn't know you dance so well.

529
01:08:18,368 --> 01:08:21,283
Forget it. l'm very happy today.

530
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,187
The show went off better than...
Veera....?

531
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,817
l'm a poet and you're my poetry.

532
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:38,691
That day you escaped my clutches.

533
01:08:39,488 --> 01:08:41,378
But who will rescue you today?

534
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,866
- Come on. - Let go!
- Get lost!

535
01:09:01,825 --> 01:09:03,201
Don't beat him!

536
01:09:26,048 --> 01:09:27,554
Police! Run!

537
01:09:27,937 --> 01:09:29,121
Catch them all!
Don't let anyone escape!

538
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:33,057
What were you doing here?

539
01:09:33,888 --> 01:09:37,604
You know how helpless you are.

540
01:09:38,305 --> 01:09:41,795
Man protects woman. You can't
Iook after yourself, forget any girl!

541
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:46,084
Had anything untoward happened,
you wouldn't ever forgive yourself!

542
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:53,668
Excellent God!
What justice you mete out!

543
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,372
You snatched my parents
as soon as l took birth.

544
01:09:58,977 --> 01:10:00,706
l said nothing.

545
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:05,027
When l was able to walk,
you gave me these crutches.

546
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:06,849
l kept mum.

547
01:10:07,713 --> 01:10:11,973
From childhood to youth
l had to cross many dark alleys.

548
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,273
l had to bear loneliness.

549
01:10:15,264 --> 01:10:17,345
l bore everything. Do you know why?

550
01:10:18,689 --> 01:10:21,315
Because l'm accustomed to
drinking this bitter truth!

551
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:26,276
But when you made me realize this
bitter truth in front of Pooja...

552
01:10:27,617 --> 01:10:28,993
l couldn't tolerate it.

553
01:10:30,816 --> 01:10:32,449
Today l realize it, dear God...

554
01:10:33,377 --> 01:10:35,394
l am truly an incomplete man!

555
01:10:35,937 --> 01:10:39,108
A cripple! Is this my fault?

556
01:10:39,745 --> 01:10:40,961
ls this my crime?

557
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:44,483
Who made this incomplete man?

558
01:10:45,184 --> 01:10:49,636
Who has made me a joke
in the eyes of the world?

559
01:10:52,129 --> 01:10:53,986
Answer me! Who brought me
to this juncture of life?

560
01:10:54,432 --> 01:10:58,853
You! You are the culprit not me!

561
01:10:59,648 --> 01:11:01,314
You are at fault, not me!

562
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,243
For what crime are you punishing me?

563
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,385
Answer me!

564
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:48,098
Let's go.

565
01:12:07,488 --> 01:12:09,313
l've found the answer
to every question, my Lord.

566
01:12:11,009 --> 01:12:12,162
Forgive me.

567
01:12:14,048 --> 01:12:16,259
Good your plane didn't get derailed.

568
01:12:16,705 --> 01:12:21,285
Once l was going to America, the
plane was delayed. Both stayed here.

569
01:12:21,792 --> 01:12:25,764
Quiet. Hope you didn't
tell Aman l'm coming.

570
01:12:26,081 --> 01:12:28,418
How could l say when
you told me not to tell him?

571
01:12:28,672 --> 01:12:30,819
You said, so l didn't tell him.

572
01:12:31,105 --> 01:12:34,115
But why the suspense?

573
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,603
Anything that occurs suddenly
has its own pleasure.

574
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,387
Aman and l will meet
each other suddenly.

575
01:12:46,848 --> 01:12:49,442
What happened suddenly, mamma mia!

576
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,066
l think the tire is punctured.

577
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,819
How did this happen suddenly?

578
01:12:58,432 --> 01:13:01,155
Did you call me beautiful?

579
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:06,917
You look after the tire.
l'll look after them.

580
01:13:07,457 --> 01:13:08,962
What is it?

581
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,016
Do you mind getting up?

582
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,713
Walking like a blind bat!

583
01:14:18,785 --> 01:14:19,905
Tire ready sir.

584
01:14:21,377 --> 01:14:23,778
He's got a flat!

585
01:19:22,569 --> 01:19:24,593
What a girl she was!

586
01:19:30,503 --> 01:19:33,160
You're in love again!

587
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:36,490
She was terrific from head to toe!

588
01:19:37,031 --> 01:19:39,786
She wounded this friend
of yours with one look!

589
01:19:40,265 --> 01:19:43,659
You! Hardly saw the girl
and already wounded?

590
01:19:46,729 --> 01:19:48,747
ln my shoes you too would be wounded!

591
01:19:50,344 --> 01:19:53,517
How do l describe her?
She's the first ray of the sun!

592
01:19:54,121 --> 01:19:56,265
What happens to the second,
third and fourth rays?

593
01:19:57,706 --> 01:20:01,517
Them? They'll get a complex on
seeing her and hide behind clouds.

594
01:20:02,154 --> 01:20:06,317
- And this?
- Don't ask pal!

595
01:20:07,306 --> 01:20:10,222
She entered my heart through
the windows of the eyes.

596
01:20:11,564 --> 01:20:13,231
ls that a heart or a traflic light?

597
01:20:13,995 --> 01:20:16,526
The eye blinks later but
the signal comes first.

598
01:20:17,163 --> 01:20:19,759
Careful. There might be an accident.

599
01:20:20,876 --> 01:20:22,957
lt had to take place and it has!

600
01:20:24,365 --> 01:20:26,415
Now l wait for the day..

601
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,910
When l will see her.

602
01:20:29,807 --> 01:20:31,855
Later. First let's eat dinner.

603
01:20:32,686 --> 01:20:34,320
You're not interested
in my love story!

604
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:45,586
- Where is Akash?
- He himself doesn't know that.

605
01:20:46,447 --> 01:20:50,259
l mean he doesn't eat or drink.
No manners to sleep either!

606
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,004
Honestly his condition
is very dangerous.

607
01:21:19,316 --> 01:21:21,750
You're standing here.
And l've searched the whole house!

608
01:21:23,028 --> 01:21:26,264
Why are you looking like a Romeo?

609
01:21:26,901 --> 01:21:29,208
You neither eat nor drink on time
nor do you come to the site.

610
01:21:29,876 --> 01:21:33,818
l don't know what's wrong with me.

611
01:21:35,094 --> 01:21:37,976
l don't like anything.
Only one thing bothers me.

612
01:21:38,868 --> 01:21:39,959
Where do l find her?

613
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:43,160
Don't you feel sorry for me?

614
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:47,259
- A little.
- Help me find her.

615
01:21:48,409 --> 01:21:50,425
Help you find her? Are you nuts?

616
01:21:51,255 --> 01:21:58,015
All right. Be ready in the morning.

617
01:22:05,561 --> 01:22:08,699
Get up!

618
01:22:12,987 --> 01:22:17,120
- Have you found her?
- Do you see her night and day?

619
01:22:17,661 --> 01:22:20,511
Harvest your beard and get dressed.

620
01:22:21,212 --> 01:22:23,293
Lalchand was asking about you.
Even Dad called up.

621
01:22:23,867 --> 01:22:27,392
Get on line before a warrant
is issued in your name.

622
01:22:28,701 --> 01:22:30,590
- Do l have to come?
- Yes, you have to!

623
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:35,967
Pooja is here to meet you.
She's waiting in the hall.

624
01:22:37,023 --> 01:22:40,449
Come down quickly. l'll be downstairs.

625
01:22:44,607 --> 01:22:46,977
- Who is Pooja?
- The owner of Popular Book Store.

626
01:22:47,391 --> 01:22:49,057
Aman sir buys books from her.

627
01:22:51,391 --> 01:22:52,384
A girl?

628
01:22:53,152 --> 01:22:56,708
Aman with a girl? Can't get it.

629
01:22:59,168 --> 01:23:01,443
Aman buying books. Get it?

630
01:23:02,369 --> 01:23:05,733
What you talking? l can't understand

631
01:23:10,401 --> 01:23:12,645
Go to the kitchen and
make me breakfast.

632
01:23:13,474 --> 01:23:15,653
Get it or do l have to explain?

633
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:24,391
- How did you come by?
- Nothing special.

634
01:23:25,027 --> 01:23:28,231
You didn't turn up after the show.
Mother too was upset.

635
01:23:28,931 --> 01:23:30,309
Even l wondered what the matter was.

636
01:23:30,628 --> 01:23:32,422
l couldn't come as l was busy.

637
01:23:32,997 --> 01:23:34,951
Tell her soon l'll come to see her.

638
01:23:36,773 --> 01:23:38,695
She has sent carrot pudding for you.

639
01:23:40,485 --> 01:23:42,248
Thank her on my behalf.

640
01:23:42,663 --> 01:23:45,448
See you. It's time to open the shop.

641
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:52,010
l forgot to tell you one thing.
Sagar's new book has arrived.

642
01:23:52,775 --> 01:23:53,929
You'll get it at a discount.

643
01:24:50,415 --> 01:24:51,279
What happened to him?

644
01:24:53,581 --> 01:24:54,703
Get some water!

645
01:24:56,015 --> 01:24:59,057
What happened to him?
Here's some water.

646
01:25:01,712 --> 01:25:03,665
- Found her!
- Found whom?

647
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,452
The one who stole my sleep, my peace!

648
01:25:07,089 --> 01:25:08,370
But where did you see her here?

649
01:25:09,201 --> 01:25:10,963
Don't ask the story of my love!

650
01:25:11,698 --> 01:25:14,836
The one l searched all over town,
was found in my own backyard!

651
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:20,084
- What's wrong with him?
- But who is she?

652
01:25:20,851 --> 01:25:22,836
The one who's just come home.

653
01:25:25,139 --> 01:25:29,238
She's the girl l was searching for!

654
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:33,334
The queen of my dreams.
My heart throb!

655
01:25:35,222 --> 01:25:37,974
lf l get her, my life will change.

656
01:25:39,861 --> 01:25:46,010
ls she the same girl?
Did you recognize her?

657
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:49,688
My eyes don't deceive me.

658
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:54,009
How can l forget the face
that made me forget myself?

659
01:25:54,903 --> 01:25:57,466
l swear by you l can never forget her!

660
01:25:59,862 --> 01:26:03,098
Perceive the target of the arrow.

661
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:07,548
Lightning struck there
but my nest was destroyed!

662
01:26:07,991 --> 01:26:10,746
The ship of hope was almost ashore.

663
01:26:11,256 --> 01:26:13,819
Time! Did the storm have to hit now?

664
01:26:27,551 --> 01:26:30,464
You gave new life to my words.

665
01:26:31,072 --> 01:26:34,083
She's the first ray of sunlight.
l can't live without her!

666
01:26:34,688 --> 01:26:37,891
Only you can diminish the distance
between us. l need your help.

667
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:42,692
There was only one ray
of light in my dark life.

668
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:46,979
l love her very much.

669
01:26:50,114 --> 01:26:52,677
My foot wouldn't come near you!

670
01:26:53,123 --> 01:26:56,229
Have you ever seen your face?
l became victim to a bet.

671
01:26:56,674 --> 01:27:01,415
Somebody can give you pity
but not love! Cripple!

672
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:06,319
For the sake of friendship
l will sacrifice my love.

673
01:27:07,724 --> 01:27:09,261
Pooja will only belong to Akash!

674
01:29:42,372 --> 01:29:44,615
You're standing here.
l looked for you all over.

675
01:29:45,284 --> 01:29:46,694
l've made one decision.

676
01:29:47,684 --> 01:29:51,497
To attain Pooja, l'm willing
to do anything, scale any heights.

677
01:29:53,349 --> 01:29:55,943
She is not that type of girl.
l know her quite well.

678
01:29:57,477 --> 01:30:00,715
She loves a poet whom
she has never seen.

679
01:30:01,831 --> 01:30:02,951
Who is that fortunate man?

680
01:30:04,647 --> 01:30:06,473
His name is Sagar.

681
01:30:07,688 --> 01:30:08,904
And he lives in Bombay.

682
01:30:09,703 --> 01:30:11,819
Through letters,
she gave him her heart.

683
01:30:13,415 --> 01:30:15,305
Then what do l do?
What happens to me?

684
01:30:16,265 --> 01:30:17,418
There is one way.

685
01:30:18,281 --> 01:30:21,613
To win her love, you must
pretend to be him.

686
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:26,445
- What do you mean?
- l mean you must become Sagar.

687
01:30:26,827 --> 01:30:28,875
No, l can't do this!

688
01:30:29,195 --> 01:30:32,878
You just said, you'd do anything.

689
01:30:33,515 --> 01:30:34,796
That doesn't mean l'll become Sagar!

690
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:45,573
Would it be right to reach the
peak of love through fraudulent means?

691
01:30:48,321 --> 01:30:53,478
Maybe you've forgotten that
Lord Krishna said in the Geeta...

692
01:30:54,017 --> 01:30:57,893
lf a lie helps somebody,
it's better than a 1000 truths.

693
01:30:58,947 --> 01:31:02,119
And then you are smart, handsome,
and belong to a rich family.

694
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:06,373
lf you come into her life,
her life will change.

695
01:31:07,715 --> 01:31:09,765
God knows what kind of a man Sagar is.

696
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:13,237
What if he is lame or cripple like me?

697
01:31:15,092 --> 01:31:16,468
l don't like this kind of joke!

698
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,046
We'll talk about it later.

699
01:31:21,493 --> 01:31:23,926
But do you agree with my decision?

700
01:31:24,884 --> 01:31:26,422
- What do you say?
- Yes.

701
01:31:48,344 --> 01:31:52,251
Today l'm going to give you the
gift you've been wanting for years.

702
01:31:53,402 --> 01:31:56,027
Do you recall l once
made you a promise?

703
01:31:56,889 --> 01:31:59,165
That l'd introduce you
to Sagar someday?

704
01:32:04,698 --> 01:32:10,753
Friends today l wish to present
my friend, a famous poet to you.

705
01:32:11,836 --> 01:32:14,558
He will sing his own
composition before you.

706
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:20,142
- You?
- Yes the same blind bat.

707
01:35:20,814 --> 01:35:22,639
Why didn't you tell me then
that you were Sagar?

708
01:35:23,118 --> 01:35:24,785
lf you had time to get up,
then l'd tell you.

709
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:28,144
Shall we go home?

710
01:35:28,559 --> 01:35:30,833
Meet him. He's Sagar.

711
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:33,008
She's my friend Renu.

712
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:38,805
Sagar is the name l write poems
with. My name is Akash Verma.

713
01:35:39,951 --> 01:35:41,201
Pleased to meet you.

714
01:35:41,999 --> 01:35:43,889
So am l but very little.

715
01:35:44,144 --> 01:35:47,188
Because she's the most happy.

716
01:35:47,985 --> 01:35:50,036
She'd talk of you night and day.

717
01:35:50,449 --> 01:35:51,505
You have to be naughty!

718
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:58,579
l'll wait for you in Garden
Court tomorrow evening at 6.

719
01:36:21,845 --> 01:36:26,490
Excuse me. Water.

720
01:36:44,088 --> 01:36:46,363
Excuse me.

721
01:36:51,512 --> 01:36:53,050
What's the time?

722
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:57,467
The best time to romance.
Don't disturb me.

723
01:36:58,875 --> 01:37:02,077
Not your fault. In your shoes
l probably would do the same.

724
01:37:02,876 --> 01:37:06,879
Keep a jug here.

725
01:37:10,651 --> 01:37:12,252
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

726
01:37:12,668 --> 01:37:15,646
Either that man is born thirsty
or he comes from a desert!

727
01:37:21,211 --> 01:37:22,333
When will she come?

728
01:37:24,413 --> 01:37:27,615
She will come. Positively.

729
01:37:28,703 --> 01:37:34,980
She won't go anywhere
without coming here.

730
01:37:38,110 --> 01:37:40,962
What's his problem?

731
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:48,006
About 4 years ago his beloved
promised to meet him here.

732
01:37:48,608 --> 01:37:52,323
But she never turned up
Initially he's drink water like you.

733
01:37:57,665 --> 01:37:59,106
Now he drinks liquor.

734
01:38:01,635 --> 01:38:03,236
l hope l don't turn to be like him!

735
01:38:08,706 --> 01:38:12,999
- Go.
- l'm nervous!

736
01:38:14,307 --> 01:38:16,870
Your aim is there. Now l'm ofl!

737
01:38:17,764 --> 01:38:19,013
- Come with me.
- Why?

738
01:38:20,643 --> 01:38:23,976
l'm scared. My heart is beating.

739
01:38:24,517 --> 01:38:27,239
lt's running faster than the Rajdhani

740
01:38:28,101 --> 01:38:29,863
- Where are you going?
- You're very cruel!

741
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:32,519
l'm dying of fright and
you're cracking jokes!

742
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:39,598
ln the field of love, beauty and
Iove have to confront each other alone

743
01:38:40,135 --> 01:38:41,833
- Just jump in!
- No!

744
01:44:20,114 --> 01:44:24,150
Come in and sit.

745
01:44:24,945 --> 01:44:27,829
- Get 3 coflees quick.
- In a minute.

746
01:44:29,426 --> 01:44:32,694
Are you so busy these days
that you have no time for friends?

747
01:44:33,331 --> 01:44:36,695
That's not true. Actually the
hotel work has increased so much..

748
01:44:36,947 --> 01:44:38,935
There's no time.

749
01:44:39,541 --> 01:44:42,838
He's learnt only 2 things
from Dad. To work real hard.

750
01:44:43,221 --> 01:44:45,110
And earn lots of money!

751
01:44:46,005 --> 01:44:47,380
lt's each one's destiny.

752
01:44:48,789 --> 01:44:51,095
Somebody is destined to work.

753
01:44:51,862 --> 01:44:53,430
And somebody is destined to relax.

754
01:44:54,422 --> 01:44:59,066
- Destiny reminds me...
- Of what?

755
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:03,001
On page 26 of Diwane-Sagar,
you've written a couplet on fate.

756
01:45:06,488 --> 01:45:10,394
- On fate?
- Yes. Recite it.

757
01:45:12,408 --> 01:45:13,623
- Page 26?
- Yes.

758
01:45:14,713 --> 01:45:19,324
Yes it is on page 26!

759
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:25,212
You are mistaken.
It is impossible!

760
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:29,211
Mistaken? l?

761
01:45:30,106 --> 01:45:32,348
l remember every word that
you've ever written!

762
01:45:32,986 --> 01:45:35,229
Why argue on the page?
Just recite the couplet.

763
01:45:37,243 --> 01:45:38,812
- Remember?
- Yes.

764
01:45:45,979 --> 01:45:47,133
Hot coflee.

765
01:45:48,859 --> 01:45:52,832
- Sir coflee for you.
- Destiny!

766
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:59,588
Yes, Amitabh Bachhan's film!

767
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:03,425
l'm going in. Have coflee.

768
01:46:09,568 --> 01:46:12,834
What's wrong? Why is the needle
of your voice stuck at this poem?

769
01:46:13,728 --> 01:46:18,661
Actually... it's my voice...

770
01:46:19,905 --> 01:46:23,237
Stupid you recited those lines to
me this morning. Have you forgotten?

771
01:46:24,513 --> 01:46:26,722
My Maker, you left no stone unturned.

772
01:46:27,362 --> 01:46:32,197
Ultimately each man
gets what's in his fate.

773
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:36,997
How surprising! You wrote
these lines but he remembers it.

774
01:46:37,667 --> 01:46:43,177
l can't help it. Since l saw you
l've forgotten myself not just poems.

775
01:46:50,885 --> 01:46:52,708
lt's very late. l must leave.

776
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:55,046
l'll drop her home.

777
01:46:56,741 --> 01:46:58,886
Do come home soon as you have time.

778
01:47:30,922 --> 01:47:32,234
Today l was saved by
the skin of my teeth!

779
01:47:32,906 --> 01:47:35,531
lf you hadn't recited the poem,
my cover would have been blown!

780
01:47:37,066 --> 01:47:39,308
This Sagar has made my life hell!

781
01:47:40,523 --> 01:47:41,995
We'll have to do something about him.

782
01:47:43,947 --> 01:47:48,047
Let's ask some gangster
to knock him off!

783
01:47:48,555 --> 01:47:51,919
Why get involved?
As it is he's a heart patient.

784
01:47:52,493 --> 01:47:55,697
You mean one leg in the grave
and one on the banana peel?

785
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,045
l'm off to Bombay.

786
01:48:01,166 --> 01:48:05,681
To push the other foot in the grave.

787
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:09,425
You've got Pooja's love due to him.

788
01:48:11,855 --> 01:48:13,327
Then what do we do about this rascal?

789
01:48:13,967 --> 01:48:19,508
You'll have to memorize all his poems.

790
01:48:20,401 --> 01:48:21,520
l'll give you the books.

791
01:48:23,535 --> 01:48:28,308
- Will l have to do this too?
- People gave their lives for love.

792
01:48:29,041 --> 01:48:30,513
You can't learn some poems?

793
01:48:35,858 --> 01:48:39,317
When the breeze lilts,
l feel it is you.

794
01:48:44,115 --> 01:48:45,235
Lovely!

795
01:48:47,251 --> 01:48:50,037
When some bough shyly bends low...

796
01:48:50,452 --> 01:48:51,509
l feel it is you.

797
01:48:51,891 --> 01:48:54,294
lt's a question of love.

798
01:49:34,331 --> 01:49:36,123
Good grief! He's coming!

799
01:49:42,042 --> 01:49:45,887
Listen if l've learnt it well.

800
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:50,750
Get up! Listen!

801
01:49:53,147 --> 01:49:54,940
Let me sleep. l'm very sleepy.

802
01:49:57,085 --> 01:49:59,133
You learn poems all night,
l'll hear them in the morning.

803
01:50:02,267 --> 01:50:05,089
You make me a poet,
keep me awake at nights.

804
01:50:07,166 --> 01:50:08,638
You sleep making excuses!

805
01:50:10,461 --> 01:50:13,024
- Isn't this a poem?
- Let me sleep.

806
01:50:37,633 --> 01:50:39,457
l don't understand where
to draw the line.

807
01:50:41,344 --> 01:50:44,453
- What a shade of love!
- What do you mean?

808
01:50:45,218 --> 01:50:49,093
Her love has made you
quite responsible.

809
01:50:50,115 --> 01:50:51,395
Trunk call from Bombay.

810
01:50:55,075 --> 01:50:59,272
- How are you?
- Fine and you and mom?

811
01:50:59,524 --> 01:51:01,476
Very well. How's the work progressing?

812
01:51:01,924 --> 01:51:04,805
- going on.
- How is Akash the trouble maker?

813
01:51:05,316 --> 01:51:07,686
Helping with the work.
Here, talk to him.

814
01:51:10,373 --> 01:51:15,467
- Forget about me. What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

815
01:51:15,908 --> 01:51:19,146
My work is my worship (Pooja)
and worship is my work!

816
01:51:20,135 --> 01:51:24,395
Good! That's what l expect from you
Let me know if there's any problem.

817
01:51:27,783 --> 01:51:33,004
The one you thought was useless is
working hard. Work is worship he says

818
01:51:33,736 --> 01:51:36,075
- After all he's my son!
- That's the sad part.

819
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,987
- Sad part?
- Feel proud of him!

820
01:51:39,944 --> 01:51:44,238
l know him well! He must have
found a girl to go around with!

821
01:51:44,619 --> 01:51:47,309
- That must be his work!
- Why do you scare me?

822
01:51:48,073 --> 01:51:52,211
Akash won't go wrong
when he's with Aman.

823
01:51:52,971 --> 01:51:56,557
Staying with him someday
he'll learn his responsibility.

824
01:51:56,938 --> 01:52:01,712
l pray to God that they
remain bound in friendship forever.

825
01:52:02,284 --> 01:52:05,039
Nothing should ever separate them.

826
01:52:05,741 --> 01:52:09,232
- Pray from my side too.
- Why can't you do that?

827
01:52:09,518 --> 01:52:11,950
- He won't listen to me.
- Because you're Akash' Dad?

828
01:52:12,364 --> 01:52:13,999
No because l'm his mom's husband.

829
01:52:23,374 --> 01:52:26,673
What was so urgent that
you couldn't tell me over the phone?

830
01:52:26,959 --> 01:52:28,112
And called me here?

831
01:52:29,072 --> 01:52:33,460
l need your help to solve a problem.

832
01:52:35,921 --> 01:52:37,199
How do l tell you?

833
01:52:42,417 --> 01:52:45,589
One coflee. What will you have?

834
01:53:00,755 --> 01:53:02,483
How did you come here?

835
01:53:02,962 --> 01:53:06,774
l'm staying in Hotel Skyrow with
friends. You left without telling me

836
01:53:07,475 --> 01:53:10,103
l have so many fans. Can't tell
everyone where l'm going!

837
01:53:18,548 --> 01:53:21,016
Lovely toy to while time.

838
01:53:24,564 --> 01:53:25,752
- Go ahead...
- Come on.

839
01:53:36,471 --> 01:53:37,979
- Listen to me.
- l don't want to!

840
01:53:38,617 --> 01:53:40,922
Don't you dare touch me!
Who was that girl?

841
01:53:41,816 --> 01:53:44,218
Whether Menaka or Suparnakha,
who was she to you?

842
01:53:44,761 --> 01:53:47,482
- Your niece, aunt?
- She was my fan.

843
01:53:47,738 --> 01:53:50,491
lf she's a fan she should hang
from the ceiling not your neck!

844
01:53:51,545 --> 01:53:53,627
- How do l explain to you?
- There's no need!

845
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:57,789
All men are alike!
See a girl and there they go!

846
01:54:01,402 --> 01:54:03,067
Really! There's a limit to suspicion!

847
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:05,853
l wanted you to solve my problem.
Instead you've created a problem!

848
01:54:06,524 --> 01:54:09,823
- What could be your problem?
- l'll tell you if you sit in peace.

849
01:54:13,661 --> 01:54:15,230
- Yes?
- l have a good friend.

850
01:54:15,869 --> 01:54:20,834
He loves a girl so much that he
used another name to attain her.

851
01:54:22,814 --> 01:54:24,286
Another man's name?

852
01:54:24,637 --> 01:54:28,096
- Why? - Because that was
the only way he could get her.

853
01:54:29,567 --> 01:54:32,513
- So what's the problem?
- Now he is scared.

854
01:54:33,247 --> 01:54:38,597
lf she finds out the truth,
she'll neither love nor respect him.

855
01:54:39,519 --> 01:54:41,087
Tell me what should he do?

856
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:45,698
l think your friend should
tell the girl the truth.

857
01:54:47,103 --> 01:54:49,410
Does your friend really love her?

858
01:54:49,761 --> 01:54:51,587
- Yes.
- So does the girl?

859
01:54:51,809 --> 01:54:54,788
- She does.
- Then she will be his!

860
01:54:56,545 --> 01:54:58,467
Then l'll write to him today itself.

861
01:54:59,332 --> 01:55:02,501
You might not forgive me
after reading this letter.

862
01:55:03,363 --> 01:55:05,030
l have deceived you.

863
01:55:05,922 --> 01:55:11,368
l set out to build a castle of sand
but l forgot the waves would erase it.

864
01:55:12,548 --> 01:55:17,834
l'm that unfortunate man who
in spite of having his own identity..

865
01:55:18,084 --> 01:55:20,262
To make place in his beloved's heart..

866
01:55:20,772 --> 01:55:22,501
He took the support of another name.

867
01:55:23,334 --> 01:55:25,894
l'm Akash, not Sagar.

868
01:55:35,111 --> 01:55:39,531
- Where are you going?
- To give Akash's letter to Pooja.

869
01:55:40,935 --> 01:55:42,215
Give it to me. l'll give it.

870
01:55:43,689 --> 01:55:45,129
l'm off to meet my beloved.

871
01:55:47,176 --> 01:55:49,194
After much deliberation,
l've reached a decision.

872
01:55:49,896 --> 01:55:52,394
After marriage a wife has
to perlorm many duties.

873
01:55:53,256 --> 01:55:56,684
For example, looking after the
house, scrubbing the dishes...

874
01:55:57,961 --> 01:56:01,325
lf you're willing to do all this,
l'm willing to marry you!

875
01:56:02,473 --> 01:56:04,650
Ouickly answer me if
these conditions are acceptable.

876
01:56:05,098 --> 01:56:07,692
l accept.

877
01:56:13,419 --> 01:56:14,572
lt is accepted!

878
01:56:16,235 --> 01:56:23,317
- It is accepted!
- Mom Dad...

879
01:56:23,565 --> 01:56:29,107
- Young man...
- You're talking in Dad's voice!

880
01:56:29,774 --> 01:56:33,233
- What is accepted?
- You didn't tell me...

881
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:37,936
Has he caught my childhood
habit of stammering?

882
01:56:38,286 --> 01:56:41,329
- It got passed.
- Who?

883
01:56:41,777 --> 01:56:47,893
You didn't tell them.
You sent the tender this morning.

884
01:56:48,174 --> 01:56:49,522
Very good! A friend
should be like you!

885
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:57,111
You hid your friend's fault so well.

886
01:56:58,385 --> 01:57:00,468
There is no limit to
this rascal's mistakes!

887
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,893
- How long will you cover up? He...
- Enough.

888
01:57:05,648 --> 01:57:08,884
She chewed my brains at home
My eyes are pining to see the boys.

889
01:57:09,362 --> 01:57:12,727
God knows what they eat!
Each day is like a decade!

890
01:57:13,268 --> 01:57:15,445
My darlings! My precious!

891
01:57:17,939 --> 01:57:19,475
Why are you laughing?
Am l holding your face?

892
01:57:19,667 --> 01:57:20,883
- No, l'm enjoying it.
- Shut up.

893
01:57:22,708 --> 01:57:25,335
Honestly the house seems
so lonely without both of you.

894
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:29,880
- The house is so quiet.
- House? The city is quiet!

895
01:57:30,293 --> 01:57:35,739
There's a wanted poster for you.
Demanded reward for finder.

896
01:57:36,278 --> 01:57:39,032
What have l done that people
are searching for me? Who's looking?

897
01:57:39,382 --> 01:57:42,521
l'd tell you if it was one.
Every tall, short, fat, thin,...

898
01:57:42,869 --> 01:57:47,066
Coming, going, every girl is looking
through binoculars for you!

899
01:57:48,151 --> 01:57:49,879
l've given that up.
But why is he laughing?

900
01:57:50,264 --> 01:57:51,289
Feed him and shut him up!

901
01:57:53,848 --> 01:57:57,371
Don't you remember something seeing
these hills, this cool breeze?

902
01:57:58,297 --> 01:58:03,581
When we came here for our honeymoon
after we got married....

903
01:58:03,993 --> 01:58:07,261
We'd lie under the blanket
and talk sweet little nothings.

904
01:58:08,505 --> 01:58:10,203
- Can't they be repeated?
- No!

905
01:58:10,906 --> 01:58:13,181
- Why not?
- Have shame for this grey hair!

906
01:58:13,627 --> 01:58:16,253
When l had no shame for black,
why should l feel shy from grey hair?

907
01:58:16,570 --> 01:58:20,768
Because these are not our times.
Time belongs to our kids.

908
01:58:21,148 --> 01:58:23,711
Do they take birth in planes?
How did their time come so fast?

909
01:58:30,109 --> 01:58:32,895
Do you see what l see?

910
01:58:33,756 --> 01:58:35,263
- Yes.
- They're not here!

911
01:58:38,524 --> 01:58:39,776
- Come with me.
- l don't understand...

912
01:58:40,574 --> 01:58:42,046
- There's something fishy.
- Where's the fish?

913
01:58:46,655 --> 01:58:48,704
This fish is going to be
fried in our kitchen!

914
01:59:08,834 --> 01:59:09,794
Where is everybody?

915
01:59:11,745 --> 01:59:12,611
Who are you?

916
01:59:13,889 --> 01:59:17,061
- We... are...
- Thieves?

917
01:59:17,730 --> 01:59:19,332
Aren't you ashamed to be
stealing at this age?

918
01:59:20,098 --> 01:59:23,462
- Do we look like thieves?
- They wear good clothes these days!

919
01:59:23,972 --> 01:59:25,252
- Who can trust them?
- But child...

920
01:59:26,211 --> 01:59:28,421
Where are you looking? You..

921
01:59:29,284 --> 01:59:32,646
- No shame to call me child?
- Since when do you know Akash?

922
01:59:33,189 --> 01:59:35,944
What's your concern?
Who are you to ask me?

923
01:59:40,710 --> 01:59:43,079
- What?
- My parents.

924
01:59:44,678 --> 01:59:52,688
What are you staring at?
Why don't you say something?

925
01:59:53,224 --> 01:59:55,304
Had l not caught them,
they'd have wiped the house clean!

926
01:59:55,912 --> 01:59:59,532
- They are my parents.
- They maybe your par...

927
02:00:02,344 --> 02:00:03,658
What did you say?

928
02:00:16,457 --> 02:00:18,476
So we look like thieves
in these clothes?

929
02:00:18,827 --> 02:00:21,260
No. Please forgive me.

930
02:00:22,218 --> 02:00:25,062
Everybody can make mistakes.
The young, old, she, you..

931
02:00:25,259 --> 02:00:26,476
You ask the next question.

932
02:00:26,627 --> 02:00:28,973
- Since when do you know him?
- Since l came here...

933
02:00:29,245 --> 02:00:30,877
Ouiet. What's your name?

934
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:42,338
You look this way.

935
02:00:43,165 --> 02:00:46,017
- What do you do?
- l run a book stall.

936
02:00:47,710 --> 02:00:49,375
- Who lives with you.
- My mother, little brother.

937
02:00:49,791 --> 02:00:51,488
- And?
- l'm a graduate.

938
02:00:51,966 --> 02:00:55,970
When did you come?
Is everything all right?

939
02:00:57,408 --> 02:01:00,097
Oh! So you are part
of this conspiracy?

940
02:01:01,343 --> 02:01:02,817
- Mother..
- Come here.

941
02:01:35,748 --> 02:01:37,701
After listening to all the witnesses..

942
02:01:38,755 --> 02:01:40,712
This court has reached this decision..

943
02:01:41,573 --> 02:01:45,928
The accused has committed the grave
sin of falling in love with Akash.

944
02:01:46,822 --> 02:01:52,076
Hence this court
sentences the accused...

945
02:01:52,646 --> 02:01:54,920
...to be tied together in the
bond of marriage for life!

946
02:01:56,359 --> 02:01:57,639
The court's feet maybe touched.

947
02:02:03,207 --> 02:02:05,609
- Where are you going?
- To get married. - Slap you?

948
02:02:08,519 --> 02:02:12,236
- What are you looking at?
- When will she come home?

949
02:02:14,952 --> 02:02:16,747
You are responsible for the
completion of this noble deed.

950
02:02:18,629 --> 02:02:21,642
You know how much Akash
and Pooja love each other.

951
02:02:22,344 --> 02:02:27,949
l know. But l also know
Akash is a millionaire's son.

952
02:02:28,934 --> 02:02:31,916
l fear that this wall of
poverty and riches...

953
02:02:33,544 --> 02:02:37,453
The ones who gave an orphan place
in their hearts, brought me here...

954
02:02:38,344 --> 02:02:41,196
Wealth, richness, poverty
has no meaning for them.

955
02:02:43,115 --> 02:02:45,195
Pooja will reign like a queen.

956
02:02:46,729 --> 02:02:48,459
Dad will pamper her to the hilt.

957
02:02:49,354 --> 02:02:51,563
Mother will protect her
with her maternal love.

958
02:02:52,650 --> 02:02:54,572
And Akash will keep her in the sky!

959
02:02:56,171 --> 02:03:01,169
Anybody who has a son like you as
their identity needs no other proof.

960
02:03:02,027 --> 02:03:03,500
l accept this proposal.

961
02:03:05,418 --> 02:03:09,969
By accepting you've kept my word.

962
02:03:10,861 --> 02:03:12,687
- l'll take leave.
- Have a sweet.

963
02:03:13,037 --> 02:03:15,888
No, l'll have it with Dad and Mom.

964
02:03:16,493 --> 02:03:18,479
They must be anxious
to hear the good news.

965
02:03:28,239 --> 02:03:29,936
l'd forgotten the key.
l came for it.

966
02:03:31,598 --> 02:03:34,771
l don't know how we are related.

967
02:03:36,464 --> 02:03:38,739
l don't know what
to call this relation.

968
02:03:40,528 --> 02:03:44,917
Some relations are
better off with no name.

969
02:04:02,772 --> 02:04:05,527
Wear these dear. They are a
sign of our family tradition.

970
02:04:06,165 --> 02:04:10,488
They are given to the bride of
the house. They are yours now.

971
02:04:29,464 --> 02:04:31,705
- First l'll go look for that
priest. - Which one?

972
02:04:31,959 --> 02:04:34,586
The one who finishes the wedding
rites soon after taking a bribe.

973
02:04:36,631 --> 02:04:37,751
You bribed him?

974
02:04:38,745 --> 02:04:41,050
Could we ever have got married
if l hadn't done that?

975
02:04:52,411 --> 02:04:54,588
- Come home early today.
- Why?

976
02:04:56,313 --> 02:04:59,772
Always questions me! l've booked
3 tickets for this evening...

977
02:05:01,403 --> 02:05:06,561
- You, me and Pooja.
- No. You go.

978
02:05:07,421 --> 02:05:09,758
The architect is coming home
this evening. We have a meeting.

979
02:05:10,331 --> 02:05:11,614
l can't come.

980
02:05:13,021 --> 02:05:18,050
- Why are you working so hard?
- l'll see you in the evening.

981
02:05:19,262 --> 02:05:23,842
Okay, l'm going. Work hard.

982
02:05:34,015 --> 02:05:38,883
Friends, l'm grateful to you
that you called me once again.

983
02:05:39,775 --> 02:05:45,766
Tonight l'm singing for you a song
composed by a young upcoming poet.

984
02:05:46,401 --> 02:05:52,230
l'm confident that you will
like Sagar's new composition.

985
02:07:10,559 --> 02:07:11,841
He'd come with me if he wanted.

986
02:07:12,352 --> 02:07:14,273
- l just saw him there.
- You imagined it.

987
02:09:23,256 --> 02:09:27,356
The Goddess of wealth comes to Laxmi

988
02:09:29,113 --> 02:09:30,458
Nobody is watching. Put it in.

989
02:09:37,657 --> 02:09:40,829
25 paise! Even a beggar
doesn't accept it these days.

990
02:09:41,595 --> 02:09:43,868
But l do. l don't refuse wealth.

991
02:09:48,699 --> 02:09:50,814
The greatest thing is cash!

992
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:53,534
Too much greed is bad.

993
02:10:03,325 --> 02:10:06,079
l found a 50 rupee note in your pant.

994
02:10:07,389 --> 02:10:09,438
- Keep it.
- Better to ask and keep.

995
02:10:10,174 --> 02:10:12,959
Aman got dressed and
Ieft early morning.

996
02:10:17,086 --> 02:10:20,995
5 paise? Money grows in this
trouser and reduces in this one!

997
02:10:21,343 --> 02:10:24,642
This seems to have a lot of cash!

998
02:10:26,207 --> 02:10:27,936
This looks like the ticket to a show.

999
02:10:28,735 --> 02:10:30,466
That too used! l don't want it.

1000
02:10:40,545 --> 02:10:44,550
- Where did you find it?
- In Aman's trousers.

1001
02:11:02,723 --> 02:11:04,903
Wouldn't he come with me
if he wanted to?

1002
02:11:05,670 --> 02:11:08,006
- l just saw him there.
- You imagined it.

1003
02:11:10,309 --> 02:11:12,776
The architect is coming home
tonight. We have a meeting.

1004
02:11:13,190 --> 02:11:14,599
You go ahead. l can't come.

1005
02:11:16,486 --> 02:11:18,152
Why did he lie to me?

1006
02:11:19,911 --> 02:11:21,287
What's the reason?

1007
02:11:22,630 --> 02:11:24,199
Why does he stay away from me?

1008
02:11:27,271 --> 02:11:28,777
Can't understand it.

1009
02:11:30,277 --> 02:11:32,725
Can't understand it

1010
02:11:38,825 --> 02:11:41,739
The weather is pretty bad today.

1011
02:11:42,313 --> 02:11:44,972
Close the shop and go home early.

1012
02:12:09,324 --> 02:12:13,040
What are both of you doing there?
You'll get wet. Come in here.

1013
02:12:14,478 --> 02:12:16,206
Tea tastes terrific in rains.

1014
02:12:25,487 --> 02:12:27,507
Sit my dear. Sir you too.

1015
02:12:31,854 --> 02:12:34,450
Get 2 teas. Quick.

1016
02:12:59,730 --> 02:13:02,903
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1017
02:13:04,819 --> 02:13:06,261
Are you feeling all right?

1018
02:13:08,949 --> 02:13:11,509
The stranger is not seen these days.

1019
02:13:11,765 --> 02:13:12,950
- Has he gone back?
- No.

1020
02:13:14,645 --> 02:13:17,527
- Whom is he talking about?
- Aman.

1021
02:13:18,838 --> 02:13:22,232
- Does he know him?
- l can forget the whole world.

1022
02:13:22,679 --> 02:13:27,002
But not him. He'd often
come here and kill time.

1023
02:13:27,414 --> 02:13:29,786
And add on to my business!

1024
02:13:30,741 --> 02:13:34,427
- How is that?
- Tea here, eyes there.

1025
02:13:34,902 --> 02:13:38,970
And the bill would be 30.25.
Isn't that right dear?

1026
02:13:44,635 --> 02:13:45,881
Why are you laughing?

1027
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,691
When l heard about this...

1028
02:13:50,171 --> 02:13:52,859
l came here to pull his ears.

1029
02:13:53,241 --> 02:13:55,645
Then he spoke about you.
That you belong to his town.

1030
02:13:57,114 --> 02:13:59,612
He meets you daily.
And my anger dissipated.

1031
02:14:00,730 --> 02:14:03,102
And he talked about you right here.

1032
02:14:03,674 --> 02:14:05,533
And promised to introduce you to me.

1033
02:14:08,507 --> 02:14:11,710
Why would Aman sit here
and watch Pooja's shop?

1034
02:14:13,533 --> 02:14:16,992
As far as l know, Aman does
not know any poet named Sagar.

1035
02:14:17,950 --> 02:14:21,313
And if he did, he'd never hide
this fact from his best friend!

1036
02:14:45,250 --> 02:14:46,850
- What happened?
- l have to go.

1037
02:14:47,457 --> 02:14:50,147
- Let the rain stop.
- It's already very late.

1038
02:14:51,522 --> 02:14:53,476
lf it gets any later,
it will be terrible!

1039
02:16:29,549 --> 02:16:31,055
Dear Sagar Sir, Hello.

1040
02:16:31,788 --> 02:16:33,455
Let me introduce myself.

1041
02:16:34,095 --> 02:16:36,401
l am Pooja. l study in
Wilson College in Ooty.

1042
02:16:36,943 --> 02:16:40,850
And l'm a fan of your poetry
which l often read to my friends.

1043
02:16:41,423 --> 02:16:44,498
When they appreciate it,
my heart dances with joy.

1044
02:16:47,087 --> 02:16:52,374
You are the true recipient of the
fame l earn by singing your songs.

1045
02:16:52,881 --> 02:16:54,803
Because the poem was one of yours.

1046
02:16:55,728 --> 02:16:59,956
Sending a cutting of the picture of
me with the prize and a gift for you.

1047
02:17:11,794 --> 02:17:14,358
Aman Sir alias Sagar,
greetings from Anees.

1048
02:17:14,835 --> 02:17:16,501
Congratulations on your success.

1049
02:17:16,947 --> 02:17:21,529
Your new novel Toofane-Sagar
is a resounding success.

1050
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:27,866
l send its royalty to Father
D'Mello's school on time.

1051
02:17:28,597 --> 02:17:31,096
Your partner in secret.

1052
02:18:11,195 --> 02:18:14,172
Maybe you'll never forgive me
after knowing the truth.

1053
02:18:15,163 --> 02:18:16,829
Then forget me as a dream.

1054
02:18:18,362 --> 02:18:22,335
And if you forgive me,
l'll assume you accept my love.

1055
02:18:27,260 --> 02:18:30,944
Now l understand why
Pooja kept thinking l'm Sagar.

1056
02:18:59,136 --> 02:19:01,666
You murdered your friend's love!

1057
02:19:03,297 --> 02:19:06,147
You poisoned your friend's life!

1058
02:19:07,073 --> 02:19:09,186
You are a blur in
the name of friendship

1059
02:19:09,505 --> 02:19:11,748
That blur can't be erased by God! No!

1060
02:19:27,299 --> 02:19:30,855
- Keep the bottle here.
- No, you've had enough.

1061
02:19:31,620 --> 02:19:33,510
Do as l say.

1062
02:19:33,956 --> 02:19:36,327
Keep the bottle here.

1063
02:19:58,151 --> 02:19:59,529
Tell me one thing.

1064
02:20:00,776 --> 02:20:05,389
Does this bottle contain the
same liquor that the label shows?

1065
02:20:05,737 --> 02:20:06,858
Definitely.

1066
02:20:08,905 --> 02:20:15,408
But if the label was different
from the liquor inside it...?

1067
02:20:15,657 --> 02:20:16,715
How can that be possible?

1068
02:20:18,667 --> 02:20:22,381
- It is not but if it is?
- It would be cheating.

1069
02:20:22,890 --> 02:20:24,267
Cheating!

1070
02:20:24,716 --> 02:20:26,026
How wonderful!

1071
02:20:29,611 --> 02:20:32,943
This is cheating friend.

1072
02:20:33,164 --> 02:20:35,533
The label is different.
The wine in it is different.

1073
02:20:36,172 --> 02:20:40,080
The one drinking is in the dark.
The one giving it is in the dark.

1074
02:20:41,164 --> 02:20:44,176
The maker is a cheat.

1075
02:20:48,943 --> 02:20:50,703
Why did you do this?

1076
02:20:58,830 --> 02:21:00,016
What's wrong with him?

1077
02:21:04,687 --> 02:21:06,513
- What a state you're in!
- You?

1078
02:21:07,089 --> 02:21:12,022
What's wrong with me?
Just a mix-up of labels.

1079
02:21:15,729 --> 02:21:19,894
Look at this, l came for its' support

1080
02:21:20,913 --> 02:21:23,028
- But it let me down.
- Let's go.

1081
02:21:28,658 --> 02:21:31,349
- Who is it?
- It's me.

1082
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:33,972
l thought it was Akash.

1083
02:21:34,612 --> 02:21:38,231
He's a colorlul man.
He must be enjoying somewhere.

1084
02:21:38,549 --> 02:21:41,335
Why are you ruining you sleep?
Eat dinner and go to bed.

1085
02:21:41,684 --> 02:21:44,279
l'll wait for Akash.

1086
02:21:45,302 --> 02:21:49,531
l said l'd wait. l'm used to it.

1087
02:22:25,338 --> 02:22:26,907
What happened?

1088
02:22:31,034 --> 02:22:33,535
Where were you? Are you all right?

1089
02:22:34,715 --> 02:22:36,029
Now l'm fine.

1090
02:22:36,796 --> 02:22:38,620
- But what's wrong?
- Cheating.

1091
02:22:39,805 --> 02:22:48,517
Who knows for the love of what
he kept serving me unlabeled wine.

1092
02:22:50,365 --> 02:22:54,625
l got intoxicated. In my shoes,
anybody would be in this state.

1093
02:22:56,702 --> 02:23:01,539
Wrong label, cheating...
What is all this?

1094
02:23:04,734 --> 02:23:06,498
The answer to that is in my eyes.

1095
02:23:07,743 --> 02:23:11,427
When you read my eyes,
you'll find the answer yourself.

1096
02:23:14,242 --> 02:23:16,386
What do you want me
to read in your eyes?

1097
02:23:17,153 --> 02:23:18,658
You are still intoxicated.

1098
02:23:19,425 --> 02:23:22,596
Look at your clothes?
Why do you do all this?

1099
02:23:23,649 --> 02:23:25,570
Do you know l haven't slept
all night worrying about you?

1100
02:23:26,177 --> 02:23:28,964
l called up everywhere. Pooja
too didn't know where you were.

1101
02:23:30,273 --> 02:23:33,381
Just tell me where you were stuck.

1102
02:23:34,787 --> 02:23:37,830
The place where l should
probably remain stuck forever!

1103
02:23:39,362 --> 02:23:42,343
Are you the same Akash?

1104
02:23:44,227 --> 02:23:47,079
No, l am not him.

1105
02:23:48,932 --> 02:23:50,887
Because the clouds over
the sky have dispersed.

1106
02:23:52,516 --> 02:23:55,879
And l can see everything clearly
in the streaming sun light.

1107
02:24:39,242 --> 02:24:42,543
l don't believe my own eyes
but l did see it.

1108
02:24:58,414 --> 02:25:00,945
- Who is it? Chameli?
- Pooja here.

1109
02:25:01,645 --> 02:25:08,500
- Can l speak to Akash?
- He isn't home.

1110
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:11,217
- Where has he gone?
- Don't know. Didn't tell me.

1111
02:25:11,791 --> 02:25:14,194
- And Aman?
- He's gone to the site.

1112
02:25:33,009 --> 02:25:36,374
l always swam but it's
great fun swimming with you.

1113
02:25:39,603 --> 02:25:43,896
Your talks are more
intoxicating than you!

1114
02:25:44,563 --> 02:25:45,938
Talking to you gives me a high.

1115
02:26:01,908 --> 02:26:02,967
What's wrong?

1116
02:26:04,085 --> 02:26:05,558
You change colors like a chameleon.

1117
02:26:06,069 --> 02:26:10,394
You were so romantic now and
the mood has gone? What's wrong?

1118
02:26:11,991 --> 02:26:14,650
Go to the room. l'll join you.

1119
02:26:49,723 --> 02:26:50,973
Forgive me Pooja.

1120
02:26:57,020 --> 02:26:58,878
l'll never forgive you!

1121
02:27:05,630 --> 02:27:07,935
Did you have to play with my life?

1122
02:27:39,521 --> 02:27:45,384
You were right but
l still can't believe it!

1123
02:27:46,786 --> 02:27:48,388
Sagar can't be like this!

1124
02:27:52,739 --> 02:27:55,846
Be brave.

1125
02:27:57,891 --> 02:27:59,430
l am shattered!

1126
02:28:06,757 --> 02:28:10,504
Aman here. May l talk to Pooja?

1127
02:28:13,606 --> 02:28:15,623
lt's Aman on the line.

1128
02:28:34,983 --> 02:28:37,739
Aman here. Did you meet Akash?

1129
02:28:40,137 --> 02:28:42,122
- No.
- Why didn't you?

1130
02:28:50,153 --> 02:28:51,243
There's no need now.

1131
02:32:28,870 --> 02:32:33,868
lt's more diflicult to pretend
to love than to hate somebody.

1132
02:32:38,791 --> 02:32:43,564
Not only are you deceiving me
but also Pooja and yourself.

1133
02:32:44,295 --> 02:32:48,716
Deception! Can you tell me
my importance in your life?

1134
02:32:49,608 --> 02:32:53,132
What do you think of me?
A mere pawn in your game of love?

1135
02:32:53,833 --> 02:32:55,401
Whom you can use as
and when you please!

1136
02:32:57,289 --> 02:33:01,423
The one who is a
pawn in life's hands...

1137
02:33:03,755 --> 02:33:05,421
...can't treat any one as a pawn!

1138
02:33:05,803 --> 02:33:09,935
By your behavior you are shaming
yourself in Pooja's and my eyes.

1139
02:33:10,379 --> 02:33:13,325
Why do you want to use
one woman against another?

1140
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:17,937
Are you so depraved that you
are not worthy of anyone's love?

1141
02:33:18,893 --> 02:33:21,711
Yes, l've fallen in my own eyes!

1142
02:33:22,604 --> 02:33:26,545
l'm that con man who borrows
some one's name and attacks him!

1143
02:33:27,885 --> 02:33:36,983
My life is in such a mess that
anybody trying to untangle it...

1144
02:33:37,295 --> 02:33:38,768
... will get knotted up like you.

1145
02:33:39,054 --> 02:33:41,809
Leave me alone.

1146
02:33:47,761 --> 02:33:49,298
You may never have
considered me your friend.

1147
02:33:49,935 --> 02:33:51,890
But l always treated you so.

1148
02:33:52,881 --> 02:33:57,269
When the ache in the heart
increases man drowns in it and dies.

1149
02:33:58,097 --> 02:34:00,148
lf not love, we can share pain.

1150
02:34:12,306 --> 02:34:13,556
l wish you could understand.

1151
02:34:23,155 --> 02:34:25,911
Wear these. They belong to our family

1152
02:34:26,580 --> 02:34:29,335
They are given to the bride
who comes to our house.

1153
02:34:29,653 --> 02:34:31,510
Now on they are yours.

1154
02:34:38,711 --> 02:34:44,636
l've noticed for some days
you are always lost.

1155
02:34:45,366 --> 02:34:46,744
What is the matter?

1156
02:34:47,319 --> 02:34:49,240
Nothing at all. Everything is fine.

1157
02:34:50,135 --> 02:34:55,294
lt isn't. You may hide
your pain from the world.

1158
02:34:56,055 --> 02:34:57,498
But not from your mother.

1159
02:34:59,001 --> 02:35:02,044
Because this relation of
pain began at that point...

1160
02:35:02,553 --> 02:35:05,980
...when l gave birth to you.

1161
02:35:16,251 --> 02:35:19,488
Who can understand your
pain better than me?

1162
02:35:21,723 --> 02:35:24,799
Take a hold on yourself.
Everything will be all right.

1163
02:35:49,086 --> 02:35:53,411
We were having such fun inside.
Why did you come out here?

1164
02:35:55,456 --> 02:35:57,249
l don't enjoy anything these days.

1165
02:36:10,626 --> 02:36:13,796
Excellent. What a
wonderlul way to romance.

1166
02:36:14,786 --> 02:36:19,045
The same old trick. Neither have
you changed nor has your love.

1167
02:36:19,747 --> 02:36:21,253
Only the faces changed.

1168
02:36:21,955 --> 02:36:24,773
But you stayed in your place.

1169
02:36:25,860 --> 02:36:27,558
One should learn romance from you.

1170
02:36:28,293 --> 02:36:30,341
lsn't she your fan from Bombay?

1171
02:36:32,389 --> 02:36:35,783
- What is she saying?
- Her only fault is ...

1172
02:36:36,261 --> 02:36:39,304
She is too innocent.
l told her a small lie.

1173
02:36:39,909 --> 02:36:43,274
That l'm her Sagar.
And she believed it.

1174
02:36:44,197 --> 02:36:46,888
- l hate you!
- If you don't believe me...

1175
02:36:47,655 --> 02:36:50,697
Go and ask Aman Verma.

1176
02:36:52,583 --> 02:36:56,298
No, he can't do this!

1177
02:36:56,904 --> 02:36:58,921
lf he won't can l do it?

1178
02:37:00,584 --> 02:37:02,602
Go and ask him. He's done it.

1179
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:05,033
l'm not your Sagar.

1180
02:37:10,890 --> 02:37:12,747
Keep this. May come handy.

1181
02:37:14,921 --> 02:37:17,325
No, don't stop her.

1182
02:37:18,412 --> 02:37:20,460
She's going to meet her Sagar.

1183
02:37:48,750 --> 02:37:50,832
Even nature is with you today.

1184
02:37:52,365 --> 02:37:54,481
At least you can hide
your face in the dark!

1185
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:57,584
Maybe you wouldn't be able
to meet my eyes in the light.

1186
02:37:58,896 --> 02:38:02,836
- But...
- l revealed my heart to you.

1187
02:38:03,632 --> 02:38:06,419
l thought you were a
good friend, my confidante.

1188
02:38:08,336 --> 02:38:10,450
l admired you and your friendship.

1189
02:38:11,794 --> 02:38:13,395
But you let down my trust!

1190
02:38:14,289 --> 02:38:15,987
What a response you gave
to my friendship!

1191
02:38:17,074 --> 02:38:19,892
l kept getting cheated
and you quietly watched the show!

1192
02:38:21,491 --> 02:38:25,174
Not only watched, you auctioned
my love in the market place!

1193
02:38:27,827 --> 02:38:31,286
What gave you the right to bring
your loafer friend in to my life?

1194
02:38:31,795 --> 02:38:36,087
Treated me like a toy, played when
you felt like it and then discarded!

1195
02:38:37,460 --> 02:38:40,182
Why did you do this?
What did you get by lying?

1196
02:38:41,332 --> 02:38:42,710
Your rich friend's applause?

1197
02:38:43,159 --> 02:38:44,951
To whom you are obligated for life!

1198
02:38:45,716 --> 02:38:48,984
Or an interesting story
to spice up you're lonely life?

1199
02:38:49,941 --> 02:38:51,862
Tell me why did you do this?

1200
02:39:54,815 --> 02:39:56,063
Aman is my Sagar!

1201
02:40:06,208 --> 02:40:09,378
Wait. You all go out.
l'll check this out.

1202
02:40:11,265 --> 02:40:12,416
You too.

1203
02:40:26,338 --> 02:40:28,676
You are pretending to be innocent
despite knowing everything.

1204
02:40:29,411 --> 02:40:33,958
Aren't you ashamed to
play with Pooja's life?

1205
02:40:35,106 --> 02:40:36,549
Had she ever harmed you?

1206
02:40:38,434 --> 02:40:39,941
l thought a storm had approached!

1207
02:40:40,612 --> 02:40:42,566
Had it been a storm,
it would have abated.

1208
02:40:43,236 --> 02:40:44,805
But you have wrought havoc.

1209
02:40:46,501 --> 02:40:50,184
You know very well how many Pooja's
entered and exited from my life.

1210
02:40:51,334 --> 02:40:54,471
ln any case when love becomes
binding, l break it ofl!

1211
02:40:54,949 --> 02:41:01,773
ls that why whatever you did
so far was a lie, a deception?

1212
02:41:03,526 --> 02:41:08,747
Was the claim to love Pooja a drama?

1213
02:41:09,191 --> 02:41:11,178
Convincing me that you loved her..
Was that too a pretense?

1214
02:41:11,367 --> 02:41:13,450
Fulfilling Dad and Mom's dream
was that too a pretense?

1215
02:41:14,343 --> 02:41:17,259
Sending a proposal to her mother
was that too a pretense?

1216
02:41:17,545 --> 02:41:19,338
Yes, it was all a pretense!

1217
02:41:19,657 --> 02:41:24,527
Very good! Today your hand
caught your friend's collar!

1218
02:41:25,705 --> 02:41:27,148
For one Pooja?

1219
02:41:27,818 --> 02:41:32,015
What is special about her that
caused a crack in our friendship?

1220
02:41:32,841 --> 02:41:36,814
What is special in her that
a wall came up between us?

1221
02:41:37,482 --> 02:41:41,807
What's special about her that made
you forget our childhood friendship?

1222
02:41:42,284 --> 02:41:45,712
Friendship! Friendship!
l accept that because of your..

1223
02:41:46,027 --> 02:41:48,013
... friendship, l achieved
name, fame, love and respect!

1224
02:41:48,589 --> 02:41:50,094
But l too possess something.

1225
02:41:50,477 --> 02:41:52,398
My conscience, my self respect.

1226
02:41:54,411 --> 02:41:57,682
This vile act of yours has
shamed me in her eyes...

1227
02:41:58,349 --> 02:42:00,656
l hate myself because of it!

1228
02:42:01,614 --> 02:42:03,824
My conscience reproaches me!

1229
02:42:04,654 --> 02:42:07,088
l've been made to stand in the
bar of suspicion and disgrace!

1230
02:42:09,327 --> 02:42:15,157
lf l knew l would have to
face this day for your friendship...

1231
02:42:16,048 --> 02:42:18,098
l would never have made any
move to make you my friend!

1232
02:42:18,672 --> 02:42:20,017
Which friendship
are you talking about?

1233
02:42:21,136 --> 02:42:24,468
There were no secrets between us.

1234
02:42:25,074 --> 02:42:28,372
We were such good friends
who would even die for each other!

1235
02:42:29,330 --> 02:42:31,188
Then why did you keep
this secret from me?

1236
02:42:31,601 --> 02:42:32,690
Answer me!

1237
02:42:33,649 --> 02:42:35,027
Didn't you trust me?

1238
02:42:35,954 --> 02:42:39,895
Or did you think l'd break down
or be destroyed if l find out?

1239
02:42:41,587 --> 02:42:45,528
No, Akash Verma is not so weak!

1240
02:42:46,738 --> 02:42:48,790
What secret?

1241
02:42:49,268 --> 02:42:51,735
The secret that wrought
a storm in our lives!

1242
02:42:52,981 --> 02:42:55,992
Why don't you say you love Pooja?
Do you have any answer to this?

1243
02:42:57,429 --> 02:42:59,608
Why didn't you let me
reveal the truth to her?

1244
02:42:59,924 --> 02:43:01,751
...That l'm not her Sagar?
Do you have any answer to this?

1245
02:43:03,670 --> 02:43:06,520
Why didn't you tell her you're
Sagar? Have any answer to this?

1246
02:43:08,407 --> 02:43:09,655
l have the answer!

1247
02:43:11,127 --> 02:43:13,498
You always wanted to see me happy.

1248
02:43:14,103 --> 02:43:17,884
You wanted to fulfil Mom and Dad's
dreams so you sacrificed your love!

1249
02:43:18,968 --> 02:43:23,933
But you never thought the strategy
you implemented would trap 3 lives!

1250
02:43:24,761 --> 02:43:27,130
Mine, Pooja's and yours!

1251
02:43:31,609 --> 02:43:33,594
Abhimanyu couldn't come out
of that impregnable battle array.

1252
02:43:34,104 --> 02:43:38,205
But l had to break Pooja's heart
to get out of your strategy.

1253
02:43:39,227 --> 02:43:40,732
Do you still deny this truth?

1254
02:43:42,682 --> 02:43:45,276
Why don't you own up
that you are Sagar?

1255
02:43:45,530 --> 02:43:47,389
Yes l am Sagar!

1256
02:43:48,155 --> 02:43:52,993
l'm the unlucky Sagar who despite
Ioving Pooja couldn't tell it to her!

1257
02:43:55,995 --> 02:43:59,712
But when l discovered that
you too love Pooja..

1258
02:44:00,924 --> 02:44:04,000
l cremated my desires,
my dreams in my heart!

1259
02:44:06,461 --> 02:44:10,306
Right from childhood, joys and
sorrows played hide and seek with me.

1260
02:44:10,942 --> 02:44:13,024
But sorrows were miles away from you.

1261
02:44:14,974 --> 02:44:19,460
lf you hadn't got Pooja's love,
you wouldn't have got over it.

1262
02:44:23,039 --> 02:44:28,357
That is why l decided to sacrifice
my love at the altar of friendship.

1263
02:44:30,688 --> 02:44:34,083
My happiness lies in yours.

1264
02:44:35,426 --> 02:44:40,102
l am dependant on these crutches
for every step l take in life.

1265
02:44:41,251 --> 02:44:42,916
How could l support anybody?

1266
02:44:44,609 --> 02:44:48,294
l am indebted to you for life.

1267
02:44:50,018 --> 02:44:55,080
Do me one last favor.
For the sake of my friendship.

1268
02:44:55,331 --> 02:44:56,645
Accept Pooja.

1269
02:44:57,637 --> 02:45:02,440
Beautiful! Hats off
to your friendship!

1270
02:45:05,510 --> 02:45:08,232
One should learn about
friendship from both of you!

1271
02:45:09,254 --> 02:45:13,738
Aman, you wanted to turn great in
your pal's eyes. So you did.

1272
02:45:14,726 --> 02:45:19,531
By sacrificing your love.
And you're the limit of sacrifice!

1273
02:45:20,357 --> 02:45:21,864
By returning Aman's love to him.

1274
02:45:22,856 --> 02:45:26,379
But both of you forgot to
think of what would happen to me!

1275
02:45:26,728 --> 02:45:29,226
Crushed between the sacrifices
of both you great friends!

1276
02:45:29,576 --> 02:45:32,203
My love is not a toy that you can
gift anybody when you feel like it!

1277
02:45:33,130 --> 02:45:35,434
l have my wishes, my loves.

1278
02:45:38,025 --> 02:45:39,979
How easily you gave your decision.

1279
02:45:40,842 --> 02:45:45,679
You never thought what l would
go through when l found the truth.

1280
02:45:47,274 --> 02:45:48,941
She'll fall in her own eyes!

1281
02:45:49,483 --> 02:45:52,750
She won't do justice
to herself or Akash!

1282
02:45:54,475 --> 02:45:57,516
Just once you should have
said, you were my Sagar!

1283
02:45:58,155 --> 02:45:59,822
l'd give up everything for you.

1284
02:46:02,507 --> 02:46:06,129
For men love is similar to
turning the page of emotions.

1285
02:46:06,925 --> 02:46:09,680
But it means her entire
history for a woman!

1286
02:46:10,349 --> 02:46:12,879
And l did not give anyone
the right to rewrite my history!

1287
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:37,266
You don't know how much Aman loves me

1288
02:46:38,032 --> 02:46:40,405
He has shared every happiness
with me from childhood to date.

1289
02:46:40,946 --> 02:46:43,636
He forgot that one thing in this
world can't be shared, your love.

1290
02:46:44,433 --> 02:46:46,418
The love of your beloved.

1291
02:46:47,121 --> 02:46:50,901
lf you reject his love today,
you'll regret it all your life!

1292
02:46:51,698 --> 02:46:54,166
And you'll be able to do
nothing when it's too late!

1293
02:46:54,451 --> 02:46:55,891
You won't be able to mend matters!

1294
02:47:09,685 --> 02:47:14,136
You wouldn't ever get over it,
if you hadn't got Pooja's love.

1295
02:47:17,687 --> 02:47:22,843
And so l decided to sacrifice my
Iove at the altar of friendship!

1296
02:47:27,575 --> 02:47:29,881
- See how pretty this is.
- No, not that one.

1297
02:47:33,687 --> 02:47:36,441
See how is this?

1298
02:47:36,758 --> 02:47:42,366
Very pretty, beautiful. You'll
Iook gorgeous when you wear it.

1299
02:47:42,840 --> 02:47:44,922
When will you learn something?

1300
02:47:45,755 --> 02:47:47,162
- When you do.
- What?

1301
02:47:47,321 --> 02:47:51,325
- Your taste is excellent.
- l've always had good taste.

1302
02:47:52,858 --> 02:47:55,196
- You realized it very late.
- l don't mean you.

1303
02:47:56,091 --> 02:47:57,757
Did l say you're referring me?

1304
02:47:59,675 --> 02:48:04,063
- When did you arrive?
- Just now.

1305
02:48:04,443 --> 02:48:06,877
- No intimation...
- Missed you so l just came.

1306
02:48:07,548 --> 02:48:09,501
Thank God he thought of us!
Here, look after this.

1307
02:48:09,979 --> 02:48:15,843
Pass me those saris. See these.
They are for Pooja.

1308
02:48:16,382 --> 02:48:19,487
Won't she look pretty in these?
She'll look like a fairy in these.

1309
02:48:23,071 --> 02:48:24,990
A woman knows a woman's choice better.

1310
02:48:26,238 --> 02:48:29,025
l'm exhausted mother.
l'll sleep for awhile.

1311
02:48:56,771 --> 02:48:59,012
You can fool your mother not me.

1312
02:49:01,441 --> 02:49:06,311
Shall l say something? If something
is weighing down the heart, say it.

1313
02:49:07,363 --> 02:49:11,208
The weight turns to words and
evaporates from the tongue.

1314
02:49:13,285 --> 02:49:16,294
l have always given in to you.

1315
02:49:17,284 --> 02:49:18,758
l have done whatever you wanted.

1316
02:49:20,420 --> 02:49:23,112
Not as a father but as a friend.

1317
02:49:23,942 --> 02:49:26,087
Because l always want
to see this face smiling.

1318
02:49:27,462 --> 02:49:30,600
Then why the tears in these eyes?

1319
02:49:33,671 --> 02:49:36,393
At times one is so happy that joy
turns to tears

1320
02:49:36,935 --> 02:49:39,433
And overllows from the eyes.

1321
02:49:40,072 --> 02:49:41,834
- You are lying!
- No Daddy.

1322
02:49:42,471 --> 02:49:45,131
You once said life is a gamble.

1323
02:49:45,735 --> 02:49:47,082
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

1324
02:49:47,913 --> 02:49:50,764
But in this game
l have won and l have lost!

1325
02:49:52,585 --> 02:49:55,148
This house will be
decorated like a bride.

1326
02:49:56,138 --> 02:49:59,020
Wedding bands will play.
When the procession leaves..

1327
02:49:59,753 --> 02:50:02,413
People will say Rajiv Verma's son
wedding procession is really grand!

1328
02:50:03,177 --> 02:50:04,363
Aman's wedding procession.

1329
02:50:05,611 --> 02:50:07,596
- Aman's?
- Yes mother.

1330
02:50:09,068 --> 02:50:10,956
He wanted to repay our obligations.

1331
02:50:12,427 --> 02:50:17,266
Pooja loves Sagar and Aman is Sagar.

1332
02:50:18,412 --> 02:50:20,622
And l am just...

1333
02:50:22,925 --> 02:50:26,704
You...proved to be very courageous!

1334
02:50:29,357 --> 02:50:31,087
l am proud of you son!

1335
02:50:46,737 --> 02:50:48,947
How did you come here?

1336
02:50:50,417 --> 02:50:51,985
l've brought Pooja.

1337
02:50:52,720 --> 02:50:54,770
To unite her with her beloved.

1338
