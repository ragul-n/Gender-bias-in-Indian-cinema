1
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:34,400
"The soil calls out."

2
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:40,078
"The soil calls out."

3
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:46,588
"You who love me, why
are you sitting dejected?"

4
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:52,143
"Everything I have belongs to
the one who touches me lovingly."

5
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:57,220
"The soil calls out."

6
00:00:58,028 --> 00:01:04,041
"The soil calls out."

7
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:33,796
"This is something strange.
It makes me laugh."

8
00:01:36,622 --> 00:01:42,253
"This is something strange.
It makes me laugh."

9
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:47,942
"The one for whom I mean
everything is ashamed of my soil."

10
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:50,316
"Come close to me, son."

11
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:54,088
"Why do you have these
useless misconceptions?"

12
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:59,687
"Everything I have belongs to
the one who touches me lovingly."

13
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:04,981
"The soil calls out."

14
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:10,801
"The soil calls out."

15
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:17,391
"The soil calls out."

16
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,579
Let's go for it!

17
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:50,619
Shivu!

18
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:52,976
My champ!

19
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:16,472
Master. Shivu!

20
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:21,717
Yes! Shivu!

21
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:41,099
Uncle Ramlal!

22
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:44,388
Uncle Ramlal, come home quickly.

23
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:46,504
You have a mail from Kolkata.

24
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:47,888
Aunt is crying badly.

25
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:51,549
Letter. There's a letter, Shivu.

26
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:54,786
In Kolkata. I wonder
what happened in Kolkata?

27
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:56,925
I'm going home. Come on.

28
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,225
Brother.

29
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,161
Sukhiya.

30
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:07,408
Look at the loser.

31
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:10,334
I'm doomed. We're ruined.

32
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:13,788
Oh, my God! What happened,
Parbatiya? What happened?

33
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:17,142
We're doomed. We've got
this letter from Kolkata.

34
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:20,982
Shivu, how did it come to this?
We have been ruined.

35
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:23,155
What will be our fate, God?

36
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:29,685
Brother. Brother. Sister, at least
read what's written in the letter.

37
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:33,866
There would nothing else but
disastrous news in the letter.

38
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:37,721
This indeed seems to
be bad news, Brother.

39
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:40,305
I had realised it beforehand.

40
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:43,257
We're ruined.

41
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:45,104
Brother Ganga. Shivram.

42
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,472
Brother Ganga, what's the matter?

43
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:49,305
How do I tell you, teacher?

44
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,619
How do I tell you?

45
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,637
We've got a letter.

46
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:54,554
Letter. Let me see.

47
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:00,432
What happened, teacher?

48
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:02,369
Why are you laughing?
Teacher!

49
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,308
There is good news in
the letter, Brother Ganga.

50
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:07,046
Good news? What good news?

51
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:09,178
Your brother Moti
has become a lawyer.

52
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:12,894
Brother. - He has stood
first in the L.L.B exams.

53
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:16,297
Really? Are you
speaking the truth, teacher?

54
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:19,554
Parbatiya, you heard that?

55
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,472
Our Moti has become a lawyer.

56
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:24,472
Teacher, just read it out.
What has Moti written?

57
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:26,557
What's the point in reading it now?

58
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:30,530
I had told you to see
what's written in the letter.

59
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:32,554
Shut up! What's written in it?

60
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:34,253
You couldn't even
pass the second grade.

61
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:36,087
Teacher, please read it out.

62
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:40,473
No. No. Come here. Here. Sit here.

63
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:42,439
Why are you guys crowding the place?

64
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,605
You heard what the news is.

65
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,041
Go home. Come on.

66
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:47,221
Yes, teacher. Read it out.

67
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:51,581
It's written that
your brother Moti..

68
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,818
No, teacher. In English. In English.

69
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:57,888
Let me hear what has my
Moti written in English?

70
00:06:58,195 --> 00:06:59,426
Shivu, why are you standing there?

71
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:01,554
Come here and hear this. Read it.

72
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:07,766
Stood first in L.L.B.
reaching day after. Moti.

73
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:10,191
Great! You heard that.

74
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:12,926
Our Moti has become a gentleman.

75
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:15,485
He has become a gentleman.

76
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,971
Here, Master. Give me the letter.

77
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:19,439
Give me the letter. Shivu.

78
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,356
Parbatiya, say something.

79
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:23,439
I'm going nuts.

80
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,895
Okay. Hang on. I'll just come.

81
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:27,609
Let me go tell the entire village..

82
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,452
..that my Moti has
become a civilised man.

83
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,477
He has become a lawyer.

84
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:34,502
He has become a lawyer.

85
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:39,884
Shivu, ask the teacher to
wait for some more time.

86
00:07:40,202 --> 00:07:42,763
I won't let him go away
without feeding him sweets.

87
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:44,786
Give me the sweets, Sister-in-law.

88
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:48,341
I'll sit. Shiv.
- Yes, teacher?

89
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:49,610
Why are you sneaking away?

90
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:52,547
Nowhere. I'm not sneaking away.

91
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,960
I'm right here.

92
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:57,006
Now, you realise the
importance of education.

93
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:59,919
That's why I say that you
guys come to school at night.

94
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:02,115
But you guys don't listen to me.

95
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,171
Teacher, that's right.

96
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:05,714
But how do I tell you?

97
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,360
I feel embarrassed to go to school.

98
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,538
Embarrassed.

99
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:12,993
Why do you feel embarrassed in
studying? You silly boy.

100
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:16,086
For instance. You got a
letter which had good news.

101
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,379
And you guys started crying.

102
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:20,634
In this day and age, you
can't even read a telegram.

103
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:22,490
Here. Give it to me quickly,
Sister-in-law.

104
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,664
Here, teacher. Have some sweets.

105
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,204
You are really naughty.

106
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:32,513
Look, if you don't
attend the school tonight..

107
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,846
Give it to me, Sister.
I'll get water for teacher.

108
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:38,992
No. I want to hear anymore rubbish.
Not at all.

109
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:41,875
Lord, we'll be ruined. If
I lose this land as well..

110
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:42,879
So, what do I do?

111
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,322
You think I have a well of money.
He has a well of money.

112
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:47,504
Repay the money within 15 days.
- Yes.

113
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:49,381
But Lord.. - Accountant.
- Yes, Master.

114
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,485
If he doesn't repay the
entire amount within 15 days..

115
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,719
Give all his documents to Sunderlal.

116
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,874
He'll get it
dispatched to the lawyer.

117
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:56,530
No. No, Lord.
- Mr. Hari.

118
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,633
My Moti has become..

119
00:08:58,714 --> 00:09:00,754
I heard everything.
I heard everything.

120
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:02,147
Okay. When will I get the sweets?

121
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:04,310
Mr. Hari, this has happened
only because of your kindness.

122
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:06,643
If you hadn't given
me money on my land..

123
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:08,810
..today Moti
wouldn't have been a lawyer.

124
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:12,561
Gangaram, Moti has
always been a talented boy.

125
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:15,144
Gangaram, he has made
the entire village proud.

126
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:17,197
He has made the entire
village proud. Come. Sit. Sit.

127
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:18,643
Not here, Brother.

128
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:21,692
Sit beside me,
Gangaram. Sit beside me.

129
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,483
Gangaram, you're no less.

130
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:26,810
No one does so much
for one's step-brother.

131
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:28,332
Isn't it, Sunderlal?
-Everyone does it, Master.

132
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,592
No. no. No one does it.

133
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:32,346
Yes. No one does,
Gangaram. No one does.

134
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:34,390
Mr. Hari, this is all your blessing.

135
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:36,198
I just have one more request.

136
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,144
Just as you have been
patient for all these days.

137
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,474
Give me some more time.

138
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,076
As soon Moti starts earning.

139
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:44,726
I'll repay your entire
loan little by little.

140
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:46,810
You'll have to repay it.

141
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:47,977
You keep quiet.

142
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:49,561
We're discussing
something important.

143
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:51,096
I'm quiet, Master.

144
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:54,394
So, Gangaram.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:56,802
You were talking
about repaying the loan.

146
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:01,886
As you know, I'm not
greedy about money or wealth.

147
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,463
I lend money to so many
people when they need it.

148
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:06,973
Some repay it. And some don't.

149
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:10,561
Well, now you don't
need to free the land.

150
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:15,977
I've thought of giving that
land to Moti just like that.

151
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:20,227
What? - There has been something
on my mind for quite a while.

152
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:21,643
If you say, I'll tell you.

153
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:22,810
Sure, Master.

154
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:25,849
Gangaram, after all
I'm father of a daughter.

155
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:28,065
I'll have to take the initiative.

156
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:30,481
If you are okay with it.

157
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:35,469
I want to get my
daughter Radha married to Moti.

158
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,561
What?

159
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,119
"Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud."

160
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:21,650
"Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud."

161
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:27,186
"He is so stupid. He doesn't
understand my love for him."

162
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:32,201
"Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud."

163
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:38,116
"He is so stupid. He doesn't
understand my love for him."

164
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:43,334
"Go there and pour down."

165
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:48,442
"Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud."

166
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,116
"He is so stupid. He doesn't
understand my love for him."

167
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:20,646
"I wonder how come I
looked into his eyes."

168
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:25,723
"I wonder how come I
looked into his eyes."

169
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:30,530
"I got smitten by
an absolute idiot."

170
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:35,898
"I got smitten and lost."

171
00:12:36,128 --> 00:12:41,300
"He is so stupid. He doesn't
understand my love for him."

172
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:46,683
"Go there and pour down."

173
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:51,754
"Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud."

174
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:57,579
"He is so stupid. He doesn't
understand my love for him."

175
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:18,435
"His energy has got into my body."

176
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:23,691
"His energy has got into my body."

177
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,438
"He never asks me why I look bored."

178
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:33,527
"I'm tired of trying to woo him."

179
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:39,408
"He is so stupid. He doesn't
understand my love for him."

180
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:56,691
"My drape explains to
him to hold my hand."

181
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,767
"My drape explains to
him to hold my hand."

182
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,577
"My drape explains
him to embrace me."

183
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:11,736
"I've given up
trying to explain to him."

184
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:17,208
"He is so stupid. He doesn't
understand my love for him."

185
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:22,348
"Go there and pour down."

186
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:27,395
"Go to my beloved, oh, dark cloud."

187
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:32,522
"He is so stupid. He doesn't
understand my love for him."

188
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:37,922
"He is so stupid. He doesn't
understand my love for him."

189
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:04,771
Radha, I know you're angry.

190
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:06,492
But I couldn't help it.
You don't know..

191
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,021
..the things that
happened in my house.

192
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:10,968
When you hear it..
- Shivu. - What?

193
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:17,912
Have you ever thought
why I meet you secretly?

194
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:20,302
Why do I wait for you hours on end?

195
00:15:20,605 --> 00:15:21,771
I sure have.

196
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,771
We're childhood friends.
We've played together.

197
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:28,136
I get sugarcane and guava for you.

198
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:32,526
Hey! You're still angry.

199
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:36,687
Look, Shiv. We've grown up.

200
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:38,854
We shouldn't be meeting like this.

201
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,604
I'll never come here.

202
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,355
And you also don't call me.

203
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:43,687
What's wrong with you, Radha?

204
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,234
Why are you talking rubbish today?

205
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,002
Radha.

206
00:15:50,672 --> 00:15:54,519
What is this?

207
00:15:55,523 --> 00:16:00,687
Shiva, have you ever
thought that I'm a girl.

208
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,406
What's there to think about?
You're a girl.

209
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:09,120
I'll get married.
- But every girl gets married.

210
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,188
I'll go to my in-laws' house.

211
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:14,105
I'll go away from you.

212
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:15,938
So what?

213
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:18,021
I'll come to your
in-laws' house to meet you.

214
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:20,599
And then at times, you'll
also come to you maternal house.

215
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:24,355
You'll also get married.

216
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:28,771
How can I get married?
I'm still small.

217
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,938
First, brother Moti will
get married. Only then.

218
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:35,377
You are indeed stupid.

219
00:16:35,688 --> 00:16:36,771
You'll never understand.

220
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:38,849
Radha, listen. Radha, listen.

221
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,687
She's such a silly and strange girl.

222
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:46,687
She is getting sad fearing
that we'll get separated.

223
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:51,355
She says that you'll
get married as well.

224
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:57,651
Great, Moti.

225
00:16:57,732 --> 00:17:00,938
Well done, Moti.

226
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:02,704
You're a champ..

227
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:07,020
What is this? What is this?

228
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:09,270
You are drunk.

229
00:17:09,356 --> 00:17:11,852
Listen, Parbatiya.

230
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,231
Everyone said it's great news..

231
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,985
..when they heard about Moti.

232
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:22,271
Get us some drinks. So,
I drank as well.

233
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:24,108
But why did you drink?

234
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:25,271
What do you mean why?

235
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:28,270
They said it's a happy occasion.

236
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:29,604
You also drink some.

237
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:31,271
And you drank it.
- Yes.

238
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:34,813
If you ever get drunk again,
it will be either you or me.

239
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:36,871
Is it?
- Yes.

240
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,780
Then I won't have drink.

241
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:41,809
My queen.

242
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:45,682
The queen of my heart.

243
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:49,938
Brother. What happened,
Sister-in-law?

244
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:53,602
He has got drunk in
trying to celebrate.

245
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,352
My Moti has become a
man of refinement.

246
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,604
Brother. Brother, get up.
Come on, have some food.

247
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:01,522
What have some food? Have some food.

248
00:18:01,603 --> 00:18:03,722
Listen, Shivu..
- Yes.

249
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,858
Shiv, here. Take this.

250
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:07,355
Where the hell is it?

251
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:10,110
Here. Take this.

252
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:14,568
Go get a little drunk.

253
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,274
Oh, my! What the
hell are you saying?

254
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:17,869
Just get back to your senses.

255
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,771
Stop talking about my senses.

256
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:26,941
It's such great news that you'll
also get drunk upon hearing it.

257
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:28,675
What the hell are you laughing for?

258
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:30,687
Pour a pot of water on him.

259
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:32,355
Brother. Brother, come.

260
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:34,173
What the heck?

261
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,185
You know what the news is?
- Brother.

262
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,098
Shall I tell what the news is?

263
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:39,355
First, lie down.
Then you can tell me.

264
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,355
Yes.
- lie down. - Yes, I'll lie down.

265
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:43,042
Here you are. I've lied down.

266
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:44,407
Now, shall I tell
you what the news is? - Yes.

267
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:47,538
My Moti is great. Well done, Great.

268
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:51,035
My Moti has become so able.

269
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,892
Parbatiya. Parbatiya.
- What?

270
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:57,662
Why are you getting annoyed?

271
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,858
At least hear me out.

272
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:04,278
You know what Mr. Hari
upon hearing about Moti?

273
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,635
He held my hand and said Gangaram..

274
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:10,331
..you don't have repay
the mortgage amount.

275
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:13,014
I'll give the land to
Moti just like that.

276
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:15,783
What?
- Yes.

277
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:18,522
And you know what he said.

278
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:23,574
He said, "Gangaram,
get Moti married to.."

279
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:28,224
"..my daughter Radha."

280
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:31,025
Really. Is this true, Brother?

281
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:33,271
This is not true for sure.

282
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:35,858
He's blabbering away under
the influence of the alcohol.

283
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:38,773
No, Parbatiya.

284
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:45,184
If you don't believe me,
then sent Shivu to..

285
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:48,280
..Mr. Hari and get it confirmed.

286
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:52,184
Shiva, what is he saying.
Is this true?

287
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:57,015
Will Mr. Hari get his
daughter married to Moti?

288
00:19:57,175 --> 00:20:01,308
Of course. Or do you think
he'll get her married to Shivu.

289
00:20:01,762 --> 00:20:03,854
He hasn't passed
even the second grade.

290
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,021
Where are you off to?

291
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:06,451
At least have your
meal before you go.

292
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,889
Gosh! What took you so long?

293
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,472
I've calling you since so long?

294
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:18,475
And you're walking as if
you're out on a stroll.

295
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:19,949
Of course.

296
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,257
I haven't come to meet you.

297
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:25,138
What?
- I had told not to call me.

298
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:26,834
Then why do you call me like this.

299
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:30,889
What an attitude!

300
00:21:31,476 --> 00:21:34,889
Little do you know the
good news I have for you.

301
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:37,889
Go away. I don't want any good news.

302
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:41,054
Listen. Listen.

303
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,971
Leave me.
-This is about your happiness.

304
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,552
Now, we'll never get separated.
Got it?

305
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,722
You're getting
married into my family.

306
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,193
What?
- Yes.

307
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:54,122
My brother and your father
have finalised everything.

308
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:56,042
Now we'll always be together.

309
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:58,763
You're getting
married to brother Moti.

310
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:01,333
Shivu.
- What happened?

311
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:06,638
You're so stupid.
You're a numbskull.

312
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,879
You'll never understand.
You'll never understand.

313
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:11,305
Radha.

314
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:19,889
What's the matter, Radha?

315
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:21,805
Why are you crying?

316
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,221
You broke the news so happily.
Hence I'm crying.

317
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,472
It would be better if you had got..

318
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,051
..some poison along
with this good news.

319
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:32,846
You're a man. And you can't
understand something so simple.

320
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:35,638
Then what do I do? How
do I explain to you?

321
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,889
You want me to rip my heart out.

322
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:39,881
Or jump into the sea and drown.

323
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:41,007
Tell me. What do I do?

324
00:22:41,088 --> 00:22:45,336
Radha.
- I'm so fortunate that I met you.

325
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,581
You're an idiot.

326
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:50,138
Go away. Go away.

327
00:22:50,222 --> 00:22:51,722
Radha.
- go away. I don't want to see you.

328
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:52,971
Radha.
- go away. I don't want to see you.

329
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:54,138
Go away.

330
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,555
Radha, I understood. I
understood everything.

331
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:07,221
Get up.

332
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:15,138
It would've been so much better if
you had explained to me earlier.

333
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:24,206
Sister. Sister.

334
00:23:24,306 --> 00:23:26,557
So, Sukhi, you found Shivu.

335
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,841
No, I didn't. I
looked for him everywhere.

336
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:32,472
I guess he has gone to Chandanpur.

337
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:37,049
Chandanpur. - Yes. There's a play that
going to be held there tonight.

338
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,805
Will you also come, Sister?

339
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,138
It will be a great play.

340
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:41,889
To hell with your play.

341
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,503
Listen. Oh, my God!

342
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:48,633
Oh, God! Get up.

343
00:23:50,101 --> 00:23:51,969
What happened? -
What happened!

344
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,453
You're sleeping upon getting drunk.

345
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:56,138
And he has gone away
angry without having food.

346
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:57,889
He's nowhere to be found.

347
00:23:57,972 --> 00:23:59,576
Sukhiya looked for him everywhere.

348
00:23:59,657 --> 00:24:01,638
But who went away?

349
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:02,971
Who else. Shivu.

350
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,443
Shiv. He hasn't returned yet.

351
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:10,889
Hold on. Hold on.

352
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:13,704
Oh!

353
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:15,388
I'll go get him.

354
00:24:15,473 --> 00:24:16,889
Sukhiya, come with me.

355
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,476
Parbatiya, don't worry.

356
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,805
I'll go get him.

357
00:24:20,886 --> 00:24:23,989
Don't worry. He is dozing off drunk.

358
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,126
He has thrown is
brother out of the house.

359
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:26,472
And he is asking me not to worry.

360
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:27,722
What am I supposed to do?

361
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:31,638
No, Radha.

362
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,472
I've thought about it long
and hard. It's too late.

363
00:24:37,473 --> 00:24:40,971
This marriage..
- Will not happen, Shiv. Never.

364
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:45,539
I'll kill myself
before this happens.

365
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,889
No, Radha. No. Don't say that.

366
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:51,031
Whatever happened is good for you.

367
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,472
And then why don't you understand?

368
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:55,472
I'm not worthy of you.

369
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,305
Have you made this decision
after thinking about it for so long?

370
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,138
I can't help it, Radha.

371
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:05,889
Everyone's happiness lies in this.

372
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,413
The happiness of your father,
and my brother and sister-in-law.

373
00:25:11,063 --> 00:25:12,763
And what about the
fact I'll be ruined.

374
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:14,502
You never gave it any thought.

375
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,805
Don't say that, Radha.

376
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:19,889
You know brother Moti
has become a lawyer.

377
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:22,638
You'll get married to brother Moti.

378
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:27,278
And the villagers will
address you as the lawyer's wife.

379
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:31,772
And me. I haven't even
passed the second grade.

380
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:33,943
As if I've passed the tenth grade.

381
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:36,555
I'm also not worthy of brother Moti.

382
00:25:37,972 --> 00:25:42,820
Your father's wealth will
make you worthy of brother Moti.

383
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:44,221
Enough. Let it be.

384
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,472
Look, Shiv, I swear on God.
Only you're my husband.

385
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:55,065
Yes, and if I don't get you,
I swear I'll kill myself.

386
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:57,103
No, Radha. Radha.

387
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:00,841
Radha, listen.

388
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:07,113
Shiv. Look, there's Shivu.

389
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:11,025
Shivu.

390
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,985
Sukhi, who is she?

391
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:23,221
I guess she is uncle
Sunder's daughter.

392
00:26:23,302 --> 00:26:25,713
Bindiya.
- Seems like her.

393
00:26:30,306 --> 00:26:31,472
What's the matter, Brother?

394
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,638
What's the matter! I've been
looking for you since so long.

395
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:38,138
Shivu, that was
Sunderlal's daughter, right?

396
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,709
Yes. Yes, Brother. Yes, Brother.

397
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,531
Okay. Not a problem.

398
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:46,722
Now, I'll have two daughter-in-laws.

399
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:49,737
Sunderlal is a rogue.

400
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:53,062
But I have no choice. I
can't see my Shiv sad either.

401
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:54,722
Isn't it, Sukhiya?- Yes, Brother.

402
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:56,565
Come on, let's go talk
to Sunderlal today itself.

403
00:26:56,646 --> 00:26:59,003
No. No, Brother. Don't ever
talk to uncle Sunder about this.

404
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,889
Why? Why should I?

405
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:03,889
Okay. I won't talk to him.

406
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:05,054
Come on, let's go home.

407
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:06,638
You left the house
without having anything.

408
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:08,555
And your sister-in-law
hasn't had anything either.

409
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:10,969
And I got drunk and
when off to sleep.

410
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:13,308
Let's go, Brother.
Let's go home quickly.

411
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:14,472
Come on.

412
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:27,809
Sunderlal. Sunderlal, why
are you turning away from me?

413
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,889
Listen. I was looking for you.

414
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,221
You were looking for me.
How is that possible?

415
00:27:37,302 --> 00:27:40,974
Gangaram, you are you going
to be Mr. Hari's relative.

416
00:27:41,055 --> 00:27:43,485
And..
- Will you keep blabbering away?

417
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:44,634
Or are you going to
hear me out as well?

418
00:27:44,972 --> 00:27:46,054
Go on.

419
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:51,638
If you want, I also
could be Mr. Hari's relative.

420
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,971
How's that?

421
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:54,388
Shall I tell you?

422
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,339
I've another boy.

423
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,138
So what?

424
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:03,977
Come on. You're the
father of a daughter, right? - Yes.

425
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,728
Sunderlal, your
daughter is now mature.

426
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:10,472
Do you realise what's
happening around you?

427
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:14,305
They secretly meet at
Lord Shiva's temple.

428
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:16,805
What?
- I have seen them.

429
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:18,971
I never knew this.

430
00:28:19,055 --> 00:28:20,805
How would you know, Brother?

431
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,889
They are the kids of today.

432
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:24,544
Forget it.

433
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,404
Tell me. Do you
accept this proposal?

434
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:27,807
Sure.

435
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,876
Gangarao, I'm so fortunate..

436
00:28:30,957 --> 00:28:33,200
..that I'll be getting my
daughter married into your family.

437
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:35,836
And then the boy is also nice.

438
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:39,054
And then, why wouldn't he?
After all, he is your brother.

439
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:41,625
So, doesn't that make
you Mr. Hari's relative?

440
00:28:42,237 --> 00:28:44,646
Brother, I forget to tell
you the important thing.

441
00:28:44,727 --> 00:28:46,543
Moti is coming
from Kolkata tomorrow.

442
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:48,009
Hence you'll have to
come with us to the station.

443
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,388
Sure. Why not, Brother?

444
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:50,722
Oh, Brother..

445
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:54,221
Oh, my! Who are you?

446
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:55,971
And why are you
barging into my house?

447
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:57,805
There is no one in
the house. Go. Go.

448
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:03,376
Help! Help! Someone help me. Oh, my!

449
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:06,791
Why are you shouting for help?

450
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:09,222
Just remove your veil and look.

451
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:12,625
Oh, my God! Moti. You.
- Yes, Sister-in-law.

452
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:15,067
I got scared. I thought some
officer had come into the house.

453
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:16,629
My Moti.

454
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:21,796
You look like
just like a gentleman.

455
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:25,121
And how do I look, Sister-in-law?

456
00:29:25,202 --> 00:29:26,501
Great.

457
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:32,006
No more talking please.

458
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:34,305
Sister-in-law, I'm really hungry.

459
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:37,194
It's been so long since
I've had food cooked by you.

460
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,964
I'll cook something right away.

461
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:49,162
Great. Go for it.

462
00:29:57,723 --> 00:29:59,889
Come. Come, Gangaram.
What took you so long?

463
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:02,027
Come, Moti.
How is it going, you prankster?

464
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,565
Mr. Hari, you've organised a party.

465
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,287
You needn't have done so much.

466
00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:11,889
Why not? Moti is not like
you or me. - That's true.

467
00:30:12,055 --> 00:30:15,181
We'll have food.
Some song and dance.

468
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:16,880
Master, there is a problem.

469
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:19,305
The singer from Chandanpur
has gone to some other village.

470
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:22,058
Sunderlal, have you
ever completed any task?

471
00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:23,305
Now what?

472
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,638
Master, don't worry.

473
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:29,432
Shivram also sings
very well. Very well.

474
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:31,305
Is it, your prankster?

475
00:30:31,473 --> 00:30:32,555
You sing as well.

476
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:34,889
No. No, I won't sing.

477
00:30:34,972 --> 00:30:36,275
Why won't you?

478
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,722
You roam around singing
in the jungles every day.

479
00:30:38,806 --> 00:30:39,889
And today, you're refusing to sing.

480
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:42,502
I'll make sure of that, Mr. Hari,
He'll sing for sure.

481
00:30:42,895 --> 00:30:45,305
Shiv, tonight is a celebration.

482
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:46,635
It's a happy occasion.

483
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,660
Yes, Brother. I forgot that.

484
00:30:49,741 --> 00:30:51,388
Great.
- Come. Come.

485
00:30:51,473 --> 00:30:52,635
Come, Gangaram.

486
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:57,649
Radha, there is
celebration in your house today.

487
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,859
And you're sad.

488
00:30:59,387 --> 00:31:01,557
What happened?
- Nothing, Aunt.

489
00:31:08,975 --> 00:31:10,537
Keep dancing! Bravo!

490
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,416
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

491
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,056
Stop!

492
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:17,255
People, sit down.

493
00:31:17,414 --> 00:31:21,889
Now, Mr. Shivram will
sing a song for you.

494
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:23,869
Wow! Great!

495
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:33,588
Listen. Listen to me. Quiet. Quiet.

496
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:36,109
I forgot to tell you
the important thing.

497
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:43,471
The question is why is there a
celebration at my master's house?

498
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:46,862
Firstly,

499
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:50,889
Mr. Moti, the
brother of Gangarao.

500
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:53,718
He's sitting right in front of you.

501
00:31:54,374 --> 00:31:58,359
He has returned from Kolkata
after passing the L.L.B exams.

502
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,305
Wow. Great! Great!

503
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:04,283
And secondly, my
master has decided..

504
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:09,488
..that he'll get his only
daughter Radha married to Mr. Moti.

505
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:31,960
"That night of happiness is here."

506
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,054
"Let there be a song."

507
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:45,752
"Sing your heart out."

508
00:33:46,572 --> 00:33:52,969
"Sing your heart out."

509
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:56,969
"That night of happiness is here."

510
00:33:57,225 --> 00:34:01,312
"Let there be a song."

511
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:08,269
"Sing joyfully."

512
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:16,677
"Let a thorn prick your feet."

513
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:23,384
"Dance joyfully"

514
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:50,599
"Today, I laugh so much
that I start shedding tears."

515
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:58,325
"Today, I laugh so much
that I start shedding tears."

516
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:05,373
"Today, I sing so
much I get emotional."

517
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:14,656
"Let this song play till
morning joyfully and with gaiety."

518
00:35:15,077 --> 00:35:21,325
"Dance joyfully."

519
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,125
"That night of happiness is here."

520
00:35:25,326 --> 00:35:29,409
"Let there be a song."

521
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:36,160
"Sing joyfully."

522
00:35:58,161 --> 00:36:01,850
"I'm the dirt. And
she's the pleasant breeze."

523
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:05,594
"Why does she want my company?"

524
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:09,291
"I'm the dirt. And
she's the pleasant breeze."

525
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:13,073
"Why does she want my company?"

526
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:19,883
"She shouldn't hold someone else's
hands. And not my hands."

527
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:28,989
"Let the bride get decked
up with tears in her eyes."

528
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:35,492
"Dance joyfully."

529
00:36:35,914 --> 00:36:39,489
"That night of happiness is here."

530
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:43,750
"Let there be a song."

531
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:50,478
"Sing joyfully."

532
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:58,315
"Let a thorn prick your feet."

533
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:04,185
"Dance joyfully."

534
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:09,461
"Sing joyfully."

535
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:15,505
"Dance joyfully."

536
00:37:40,362 --> 00:37:42,409
Shiv.
- Yes.

537
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,743
Are you asleep?

538
00:37:47,607 --> 00:37:48,733
No.

539
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:54,186
I got such nice clothes for you.

540
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:56,107
Why didn't you wear them today?

541
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,160
I'll wear them, Brother.

542
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:04,430
I'll wear them for sure when
there is some happy occasion.

543
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:15,160
Shiv, you sing so well.

544
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,993
It was a happy occasion.

545
00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:22,826
That's why I sang a bit well today.

546
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:24,404
No, Shiv.

547
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:28,378
This is
not happy occasion.

548
00:38:29,471 --> 00:38:31,984
This is not possible.

549
00:38:35,161 --> 00:38:36,395
What's not possible?

550
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:40,165
Shiv,

551
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,369
look you'll
have to do me a favour.

552
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:47,007
What is it, Brother Moti?

553
00:38:47,218 --> 00:38:48,220
Ah..

554
00:38:51,014 --> 00:38:53,107
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

555
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:56,630
Nothing. What does that mean?

556
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,349
I'll have to do something.

557
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:02,160
Shiv.

558
00:39:03,923 --> 00:39:06,417
Shiv, I ..

559
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:09,986
..can't marry Radha.

560
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:15,157
Why? Has anyone
said anything to you?

561
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:17,486
What do you mean?

562
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:20,117
I mean why can't you..

563
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:25,385
..marry Radha, Brother Moti?

564
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:27,996
Shiv, it's not about Radha.

565
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:30,004
I can't marry anyone.

566
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:32,892
Why?
- How do I tell you?

567
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,850
I.. I mean..

568
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:40,182
.. I'm already married.

569
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:45,989
Brother Moti. Really. Really,
Brother Moti.

570
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:47,913
You won't be marrying Radha?

571
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:49,160
How can I? You idiot.

572
00:39:49,241 --> 00:39:55,147
Brother Moti. Oh, no. Oh, my God!

573
00:39:55,664 --> 00:39:57,510
What have you done this?

574
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,794
What if sister-in-law will know then?

575
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:04,435
That's the problem. I thought
I'll convince brother and sister-in-law.

576
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:06,197
But brother did everything wrong.

577
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:10,037
What? Brother did?
Don't you shame.

578
00:40:10,514 --> 00:40:12,575
What's going on?
- Brother.

579
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,562
Shameless..

580
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:38,479
Of course.

581
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,632
Parbatiya, I'll go around naked.

582
00:40:41,713 --> 00:40:43,699
But I will not wear clothes
given by this shameless guy.

583
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,062
Nor will I.

584
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:46,156
Shut up.

585
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:47,646
You are already
prancing around in them.

586
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:49,062
And look at that moron.

587
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,395
He has worn trousers and
thinks that he is some officer.

588
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,966
Brother.
- What?

589
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:15,145
Brother Moti has made a mistake.
Forgive brother Moti.

590
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,142
Shut up. He is out
to defend the lawyer.

591
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,338
I've come across
many lawyers like him.

592
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:21,711
He has become a lawyer.

593
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:22,972
But does that mean
he will go against me?

594
00:41:23,053 --> 00:41:24,128
What say, Parbatiya?

595
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:25,562
Yes.
- What?

596
00:41:25,647 --> 00:41:27,458
No.
- Yes.

597
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:32,395
Go fall at brother's feet.
Trust me everything will be fine.

598
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,811
But..
- No ifs and buts. Come on, go.

599
00:41:36,892 --> 00:41:38,312
I say go.

600
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:51,187
Brother, I made a mistake.
Forgive me.

601
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,631
When you know the entire thing..

602
00:41:59,899 --> 00:42:01,062
How is daughter-in-law?

603
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:03,863
Sorry. -
How is daughter-in-law?

604
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:05,395
Sister-in-law is very nice.

605
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,728
You shut up.
Did I ask you?

606
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:11,302
Parbatiya, this rat knew everything.

607
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:12,895
No. No, Sister-in-law.

608
00:42:12,979 --> 00:42:14,229
I knew nothing of this.

609
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,778
Believe me. Brother Moti
told me everything last night.

610
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:17,896
What? What did he tell you?

611
00:42:17,977 --> 00:42:20,050
That sister-in-law is very nice.

612
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:21,268
She's Mr. Mahendra's daughter.

613
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:23,092
What?
- Whose daughter is she?

614
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,256
She's Mr. Mahendra's daughter.

615
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,334
Yes. and she is a graduate in B.A.

616
00:42:26,415 --> 00:42:27,673
What?
- Graduate in B.A.

617
00:42:27,841 --> 00:42:30,673
Why are you saying it softly?
Say it loudly.

618
00:42:30,927 --> 00:42:35,687
Parbatiya, didn't I tell you
that Moti won't marry any girl.

619
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:36,903
Of course.

620
00:42:36,984 --> 00:42:38,506
What's daughter-in-law's name?

621
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,171
Rekha.
- That's a very nice name.

622
00:42:41,343 --> 00:42:43,172
Parbatiya, hold the hookah.

623
00:42:43,257 --> 00:42:44,590
Let me go tell my fellow villagers..

624
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:48,055
..that my Moti has
become not just a lawyer..

625
00:42:48,136 --> 00:42:50,052
..but he has also got married to
a girl who is a graduate in B.A.

626
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:59,007
But Parbatiya, when Mr.
Hari gets to hear this..

627
00:42:59,173 --> 00:43:00,756
Is he going to kill us?

628
00:43:00,952 --> 00:43:03,087
We'll get the
daughter-in-law we want.

629
00:43:03,257 --> 00:43:04,339
No, Sister-in-law.

630
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:06,999
Radha will also be the
daughter-in-law of this family.

631
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,917
What?
- Yes, Brother.

632
00:43:09,424 --> 00:43:10,903
Radha will come into
this family as Shiv's wife.

633
00:43:10,984 --> 00:43:13,245
No ways. Shiv's
marriage has been finalised.

634
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:15,089
With Sunderlal's daughter Bindiya.

635
00:43:15,173 --> 00:43:16,768
I've promised Sunderlal.

636
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:18,506
But Brother, I told you.
- Shut up.

637
00:43:18,757 --> 00:43:20,339
You think I'll do
things as per your wish.

638
00:43:20,674 --> 00:43:22,244
All this won't do in my house.

639
00:43:22,325 --> 00:43:24,041
You have an affair with someone else.
And you marry someone else.

640
00:43:24,122 --> 00:43:25,840
Brother, you're mistaken.

641
00:43:26,008 --> 00:43:29,260
What? I'm mistaken.
You mean I make mistake.

642
00:43:29,341 --> 00:43:34,814
Bother, you believed Sukhiya and
fixed his wedding with Bindiya.

643
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:37,506
And actually, it wasn't Bindiya.

644
00:43:37,591 --> 00:43:39,503
What?
- Yes, Brother.

645
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:42,439
The one you saw at the Shiv's
temple wasn't Bindiya, but Radha.

646
00:43:42,674 --> 00:43:44,007
Radha.
- Yes.

647
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:49,087
Parbatiya, what
the hell is going on?

648
00:43:49,257 --> 00:43:53,629
Now, I understood why were so
sad while singing yesterday.

649
00:43:53,763 --> 00:43:54,927
Okay. Not a problem.

650
00:43:55,439 --> 00:43:57,820
I'll go explain to Mr. Hari.

651
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,458
And I'll fix Shiv's
wedding with Radha.

652
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:05,469
But what is Mr. Hari refuses..

653
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,144
..from getting Radha married to Shiv?

654
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:09,734
Why would be refuse?

655
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,422
Our Shiv is no ordinary boy. Got it?

656
00:44:12,503 --> 00:44:15,554
I understood everything. But
only if Mr, Hari would understand.

657
00:44:15,635 --> 00:44:16,920
Then go explain to him.

658
00:44:17,004 --> 00:44:18,582
But why are you screaming?

659
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:21,953
Listen, let me tell you.
I can't see my Shiv sad.

660
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,533
As if I can.

661
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:26,155
Moti, you heard your sister-in-law?

662
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,836
Have some patience.

663
00:44:28,921 --> 00:44:30,920
Then I'll go and
explain to Mr. Hari.

664
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:33,170
I agreed for the sake of this rat.

665
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:34,916
Don't look at me like that.

666
00:44:35,287 --> 00:44:37,337
I agreed for the sake
of this rat's happiness.

667
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,086
Otherwise, you think
I would've agreed..

668
00:44:39,171 --> 00:44:40,998
..to get that lousy bandicoot's
daughter married into my family.

669
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,254
Never.

670
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:47,811
Master. Master,

671
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:51,170
look, after all
what I said turned out to be true.

672
00:44:51,251 --> 00:44:52,419
What are you
talking about, Sunderlal?

673
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,833
Marriages should
happen only among equals.

674
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:57,003
You were out to get your daughter..

675
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:58,253
..married into a low caste family.

676
00:44:58,338 --> 00:44:59,264
And you've fallen flat on your face.

677
00:44:59,345 --> 00:45:01,417
Master, Motilal is already married.

678
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:04,170
Sunderlal, are you out of your mind?

679
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:05,890
What nonsense is this
early in the morning?

680
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:07,915
Master, this is no nonsense.

681
00:45:08,216 --> 00:45:11,175
This is true, I heard it.

682
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:13,922
This is the discussion
going on in Gangaram's house.

683
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:14,928
What discussion?

684
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:17,822
That Moti got married in Kolkata.

685
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:21,598
She is a graduate in B.A.
not with any ordinary girl.

686
00:45:23,912 --> 00:45:27,655
The entire village knows I'm
getting Radha married to Moti.

687
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,285
Now, what will be Radha's fate?

688
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,662
Don't worry, Master.

689
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:33,637
Shivram's there.

690
00:45:33,718 --> 00:45:35,582
Sunderlal.
- Master, this is not my decision.

691
00:45:35,663 --> 00:45:36,911
This is their decision.

692
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:41,495
So, they've made the
decision as well. - Yes.

693
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:46,829
Sunderlal, no one in the
village should come to know of this.

694
00:45:47,195 --> 00:45:49,008
Otherwise, I'll lose face.

695
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:53,609
Moti has married a girl
who is a graduate in B.A.

696
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:57,241
Gangaram.

697
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,611
Disgusting.

698
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:29,632
Hey! Hey!
- What is it, sir?

699
00:46:30,395 --> 00:46:32,556
Could you take me to Nandanpur?
- Nandanpur.

700
00:46:32,637 --> 00:46:33,705
Whose house do you want to go to?

701
00:46:33,786 --> 00:46:36,721
Mr. Gangaram.
- Gangaram.

702
00:46:36,806 --> 00:46:37,888
Yes. To his house.

703
00:46:37,973 --> 00:46:40,077
Are you by any chance
Moti's father-in-law?

704
00:46:40,158 --> 00:46:43,245
Yes. So, you know Mr. Moti?

705
00:46:43,326 --> 00:46:47,610
Sir, sure I do. He
is my cousin brother.

706
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,507
What?
- Yes.

707
00:46:49,762 --> 00:46:51,556
Give me your bags.

708
00:46:52,104 --> 00:46:54,309
And sit here comfortable.

709
00:46:54,624 --> 00:46:58,076
I'll harness the bulls
to the cart. Come on.

710
00:47:07,738 --> 00:47:11,926
Come on. Come on.

711
00:47:14,688 --> 00:47:20,222
Brother. Brother,
rest up for a while.

712
00:47:20,306 --> 00:47:21,472
Give this to me.

713
00:47:21,557 --> 00:47:23,191
What?
- The plough.

714
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:25,055
What are you saying?

715
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,222
What will anyone who sees you say?

716
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:27,389
What will he say?

717
00:47:27,473 --> 00:47:29,258
After all, I'm son of a farmer.

718
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:31,055
You mustn't forget your roots.

719
00:47:31,136 --> 00:47:32,139
Give it to me.

720
00:47:32,223 --> 00:47:34,139
Go from here. What if someone comes?

721
00:47:34,223 --> 00:47:35,389
No one's going to come. Give it me.

722
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:38,190
You won't relent.

723
00:47:38,271 --> 00:47:41,305
You're an educated man.
You'll get me embarrassed.

724
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:43,046
You're an educated man.
You'll get me embarrassed.

725
00:47:48,113 --> 00:47:50,139
What's happening, Mr. Moti?

726
00:47:50,223 --> 00:47:52,472
I'm done for.
Look, what I feared has happened.

727
00:47:52,557 --> 00:47:54,389
That lousy teacher
is coming this way.

728
00:47:54,473 --> 00:47:56,711
Go rush to him. Go. Leave it. Leave.

729
00:48:01,306 --> 00:48:02,389
Hello, Mr. Mahesh.

730
00:48:02,473 --> 00:48:04,254
Hello. What was going on?

731
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:07,588
Nothing. I told
brother to rest for a while.

732
00:48:07,669 --> 00:48:08,604
And that I would plough the field.

733
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,808
But he is not listening. - Why?

734
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,805
He is scared. What
if someone sees me?

735
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,177
What will he say?

736
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,305
Now, you tell me, Mr. Mahesh.

737
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,670
I'm a farmer's son.

738
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:18,556
What's wrong if I plough the field?

739
00:48:19,806 --> 00:48:20,888
What are you looking at?

740
00:48:21,223 --> 00:48:24,104
Mr. Moti, if you indeed
plough the fields for a while..

741
00:48:24,185 --> 00:48:26,638
..I would get all the
farmers of this village..

742
00:48:26,722 --> 00:48:28,854
..and show them that a
well-educated person..

743
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:33,315
..is not shy of
ploughing the fields.

744
00:48:34,668 --> 00:48:36,385
I understand your pain, Mr. Mahesh.

745
00:48:37,266 --> 00:48:39,241
That's no big deal.
Go call everyone.

746
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:40,389
As it is, I'm ploughing the field.

747
00:48:40,473 --> 00:48:45,415
Gangaram! Gangaram!

748
00:48:46,678 --> 00:48:48,225
Coming, Accountant.

749
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,805
Hello, teacher.
- Hello.

750
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:56,628
Hello, Mr. Moti.
- Hello.

751
00:48:57,223 --> 00:48:58,305
What's the matter, Accountant?

752
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,220
Sir has sent for you.

753
00:49:02,182 --> 00:49:03,971
Now.
- Yes.

754
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:07,472
I'm dead.

755
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:10,389
Accountant, you go ahead.
I'm coming.

756
00:49:10,473 --> 00:49:11,556
Okay.

757
00:49:14,024 --> 00:49:15,139
What's the matter, Brother Ganga?

758
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:17,139
Don't ask me. Ask him.

759
00:49:17,517 --> 00:49:20,725
I had fixed his marriage
with Mr. Hari's daughter.

760
00:49:20,806 --> 00:49:23,139
And this idiot had
already got married in Kolkata.

761
00:49:23,473 --> 00:49:24,556
This is a grave problem.

762
00:49:25,485 --> 00:49:27,198
That's no cause for concern.

763
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,294
There's another boy in your family.

764
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,151
That's what I've
thought of, teacher.

765
00:49:31,722 --> 00:49:33,062
I wonder what's going to happen.

766
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:41,414
Hello, Mr. Hari.

767
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:50,240
Gangaram, the times have
really changed so much.

768
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,574
Yes. You're right, Mr. Hari.

769
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:55,383
For instance, you people wouldn't..

770
00:49:55,632 --> 00:49:57,903
..dare to sit in front
of me in my house before.

771
00:49:57,984 --> 00:50:00,814
Yes?
- No, No, I was just saying it.

772
00:50:00,904 --> 00:50:02,823
Sit. Sit down.

773
00:50:06,488 --> 00:50:09,854
Mr, Hari, I've something
important to tell you.

774
00:50:09,935 --> 00:50:13,159
I'll listen to what you have
to say for sure, Gangaram.

775
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,487
You people might even
have to leave the village.

776
00:50:17,737 --> 00:50:19,132
I'm not going.

777
00:50:19,705 --> 00:50:23,172
But the task I've called you here..

778
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,403
..for is more important, Gangaram.

779
00:50:26,655 --> 00:50:27,903
Tell me, master. What is it?

780
00:50:28,154 --> 00:50:33,204
Okay. Gangaram, we are
not landlords anymore..

781
00:50:33,453 --> 00:50:35,986
..that we keep
giving you people charity.

782
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:39,736
That's why it would be
better if you repay the money..

783
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:44,654
..I lent to make your brother
a lawyer as soon as possible.

784
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:49,500
Because right now, I
need money very badly.

785
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:53,522
Mr. Hari, I did not get you.

786
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:56,153
Why? Your brother
has become a lawyer.

787
00:50:56,404 --> 00:50:58,819
He has got married to a
girl who is a graduate in B.A.

788
00:50:58,904 --> 00:51:00,654
So, have you forgotten
the ways of the village?

789
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:02,570
But Mr. Hari, you had said..

790
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:04,502
Forget it, Gangaram.

791
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:05,819
The times have changed.

792
00:51:05,904 --> 00:51:08,403
Now, a man can't have two wives.

793
00:51:08,488 --> 00:51:10,510
No. No, master.
That's not the case.

794
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:13,898
There's another boy in my family.

795
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,570
If you don't mind, Shivram..

796
00:51:16,655 --> 00:51:18,656
Gangaram, come down to earth.

797
00:51:18,811 --> 00:51:20,320
What do you think you are?

798
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:21,487
I just talked to you courteously.

799
00:51:21,571 --> 00:51:22,573
And you think you
can get on top of me.

800
00:51:22,654 --> 00:51:24,173
No, Mr. Hari. That's not the case.

801
00:51:24,254 --> 00:51:25,264
That's precisely the case.

802
00:51:25,412 --> 00:51:28,736
Otherwise, how dare you want to
make Hari Shankar's daughter..

803
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,153
..the wife of your brother who
is a vagabond, a loafer, a tramp?

804
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:36,040
Mr. Hari, agreed
that Shiv is illiterate.

805
00:51:36,412 --> 00:51:38,848
But he is not a vagabond
or a loafer or a tramp.

806
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:40,903
You wanted this marriage to happen.

807
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:42,913
And you had taken the initiative.

808
00:51:43,356 --> 00:51:44,979
You have given us
the money for sure.

809
00:51:45,107 --> 00:51:47,315
But I have
mortgaged my land for that.

810
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:50,570
As if you have done a favour on me.

811
00:51:50,754 --> 00:51:52,986
Repay the mortgage
amount within three months.

812
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:55,237
Otherwise, I'll be
compelled to move court.

813
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:57,105
Three months.
- Yes, three months.

814
00:51:57,512 --> 00:52:00,625
You feel now that your
brother has become a lawyer..

815
00:52:00,706 --> 00:52:02,070
..he owns the world.

816
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,464
Can't he repay Rs.50000?

817
00:52:04,545 --> 00:52:05,825
But Mr. Hari, three months..

818
00:52:05,906 --> 00:52:08,831
Yes, three months.
Not even a day more.

819
00:52:09,238 --> 00:52:10,570
You two-bit farmer.

820
00:52:10,655 --> 00:52:12,654
And you dare to come and
discuss things with me.

821
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:15,320
Get out. What are you looking at?

822
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:17,070
Get out. Get out of here.

823
00:52:20,052 --> 00:52:23,036
Okay, Mr. Hari. Very well.

824
00:52:31,623 --> 00:52:35,352
Oh... Yes!

825
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:42,467
Sir, look over there.
Moti is right there.

826
00:52:42,655 --> 00:52:44,237
He is ploughing the fields.

827
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,824
He is ploughing the fields.

828
00:52:45,905 --> 00:52:47,403
Wait. I'll call him.

829
00:52:53,163 --> 00:52:58,068
Moti, look, your
father-in-law is here.

830
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:02,255
Father-in-law.

831
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:15,098
Daddy, you. What brings you here?

832
00:53:15,815 --> 00:53:17,217
Yes, I had to come.

833
00:53:17,298 --> 00:53:19,155
We hadn't heard from
you for seven days.

834
00:53:19,725 --> 00:53:22,846
But I see that
you're quite busy here.

835
00:53:22,987 --> 00:53:24,070
Yes, Daddy.

836
00:53:24,238 --> 00:53:25,435
That's my own land.

837
00:53:25,695 --> 00:53:27,375
That's my own land.
- I see.

838
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:30,570
Come, Mr. Mahesh.

839
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,122
Daddy, this is Mr.
Mahesh. He is a social worker.

840
00:53:37,377 --> 00:53:40,157
And he is trying really hard to get
the adults of our village educated.

841
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:41,819
Mr. Mahesh, my father-in-law.

842
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:45,446
Hello.
- By the way, Moti..

843
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:48,370
Mr. Moti, I'll go now.

844
00:53:52,147 --> 00:53:54,490
Whatever, sir.

845
00:53:54,763 --> 00:53:58,570
It's our good fortune that
we have a relative like you.

846
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,819
Isn't it, Brother Ganga?

847
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,736
It's all because of Moti,
Brother. Only because of Moti.

848
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,282
Uncle Ganga, I
couldn't find Shiv anywhere.

849
00:54:04,363 --> 00:54:05,487
I've looked everywhere.

850
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:07,601
He's a shameless fellow.

851
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:12,395
Sir, my younger brother is
very naughty. Very naughty.

852
00:54:12,476 --> 00:54:14,511
He has grown up,
but he acts childish.

853
00:54:14,592 --> 00:54:16,149
He acts childish, sir.

854
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,137
Now, look, he's just five
or six years younger to me..

855
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:20,654
..but he still calls me by my name.

856
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:22,274
Come, son.

857
00:54:22,655 --> 00:54:24,108
He's my son.

858
00:54:26,184 --> 00:54:28,405
I think I should leave now.

859
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,365
The train will arrive soon.

860
00:54:30,446 --> 00:54:32,757
Sir, have something..
- Listen.

861
00:54:38,552 --> 00:54:41,816
Sir, your elder daughter says..
- What?

862
00:54:42,056 --> 00:54:43,240
Moti's sister-in-law.

863
00:54:43,503 --> 00:54:47,132
She says, "We couldn't be
hospitable enough to you."

864
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:50,571
If you could stay for a day..
- Oh, no. It's just impossible.

865
00:54:50,737 --> 00:54:51,819
What is that, sir?

866
00:54:53,772 --> 00:54:56,001
I mean there's a big case
coming up in court the day after.

867
00:54:56,185 --> 00:54:59,040
Otherwise, would I come
running to take Moti along?

868
00:54:59,668 --> 00:55:02,546
After all, he has come to meet
his brother, sister-in-law..

869
00:55:02,817 --> 00:55:04,625
..and relatives after so many days.

870
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,903
I think Moti must be ready.

871
00:55:07,984 --> 00:55:09,296
Moti!

872
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:19,023
Sir, your elder daughter says..

873
00:55:19,246 --> 00:55:20,736
..that it would be
great if you could send..

874
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,423
..our sister-in-law here
when you get to Kolkata.

875
00:55:23,692 --> 00:55:26,365
Because nobody here has seen her.

876
00:55:26,446 --> 00:55:28,037
Yes, sir.

877
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,306
Why not? After all, this
is her in-laws' house.

878
00:55:31,688 --> 00:55:34,623
She'll come here and
look at everything herself.

879
00:55:35,529 --> 00:55:36,924
Oh, you're ready?

880
00:55:37,238 --> 00:55:38,320
Yes, Daddy.

881
00:55:44,035 --> 00:55:47,993
Sister-in-law, I'm leaving.

882
00:55:49,366 --> 00:55:51,682
As soon as you get there,
send sister-in-law here.

883
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:58,086
Sister-in-law, I couldn't meet Shiv.

884
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:00,570
Poor guy would be very sad.

885
00:56:00,807 --> 00:56:02,278
Come on, don't delay any further.

886
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:03,710
Parbatiya, where are my shoes?

887
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:05,153
No. No. Why do you take the trouble?

888
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:06,948
Sir, it's no trouble.

889
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:08,570
Sukhiya.
- Yes. - Is the cart ready?

890
00:56:08,655 --> 00:56:10,654
The bulls have been
harnessed long ago.

891
00:56:10,737 --> 00:56:13,466
My bullock-cart
would be honoured today.

892
00:56:13,547 --> 00:56:15,362
Give me. Give me that. Come on.

893
00:56:15,624 --> 00:56:17,183
Did you bring my shoes?
Well, forget it.

894
00:56:18,345 --> 00:56:20,178
Moti, go on. Go on.

895
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,367
Sister-in-law!

896
00:56:28,963 --> 00:56:30,458
Sister-in-law!

897
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:34,099
Moti's father-in-law had came?
- Yes he had came and gone.

898
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:37,008
Yes, fool where were you?

899
00:56:37,151 --> 00:56:39,264
Guest was here
and you are not here.

900
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,196
You know,
Moti was very upset while going.

901
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:44,090
What?
Moti brother also gone?

902
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:46,670
Really?
- Mahendar was came to take him.

903
00:56:47,062 --> 00:56:48,393
Moti brother.

904
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:52,659
He gone without meet me.

905
00:56:53,752 --> 00:56:54,738
When he gone?

906
00:56:54,918 --> 00:56:57,788
Before too much time.
Your brother also gone station.

907
00:56:57,869 --> 00:56:59,274
Station?
- Yes.

908
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:03,916
Hey Shive, listen.
Listen where are you going?

909
00:57:03,984 --> 00:57:05,346
I am going!

910
00:57:31,018 --> 00:57:33,466
Brother, are they gone?
- Yes.

911
00:57:33,744 --> 00:57:36,380
Where were you? Do  you know
how much I had search you.

912
00:57:36,762 --> 00:57:39,262
Brother that..
- Yes.

913
00:57:40,315 --> 00:57:43,101
Something went wrong.
- What?

914
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:45,562
Hari babu had called today.

915
00:57:45,735 --> 00:57:48,531
He has got all information about Moti.

916
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:49,483
How is that?

917
00:57:49,524 --> 00:57:52,353
That becuase of cunning Sundarlal.

918
00:57:52,658 --> 00:57:55,291
And when I talked your
marriage with Radha..

919
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:57,867
..then you know what did he said.

920
00:57:58,338 --> 00:58:02,350
Finally he said.
Give your all money in three month..

921
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:04,494
Otherwise hand over you land.

922
00:58:04,755 --> 00:58:07,427
All these things I couldn't
talk to Moti.

923
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,376
But what is in that for worry?

924
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,069
We will see
whatever will happen.

925
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,240
What?
We will see?

926
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,458
Shiva all this happening
because of you.

927
00:58:18,617 --> 00:58:20,101
Moti has married.

928
00:58:20,142 --> 00:58:22,416
And you are enjoying with Radha.

929
00:58:22,497 --> 00:58:24,625
And all trouble is my head.

930
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:35,030
Radha! Radha! Listen!

931
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,917
No, no, no!
I won't say yes ever.

932
00:58:38,117 --> 00:58:40,244
You said such good news at midnight.

933
00:58:40,425 --> 00:58:42,742
"Radha, I am going to Calcutta."

934
00:58:45,342 --> 00:58:46,461
Radha.
- Yes!

935
00:58:46,502 --> 00:58:48,337
Why are you shouting?

936
00:58:48,953 --> 00:58:52,464
Tell me one thing. Why is your
objection that I am going to Calcutta?

937
00:58:58,197 --> 00:59:01,491
Look, Radha. It was tough to
persuade brother and sister-in-law.

938
00:59:01,817 --> 00:59:04,943
And you're acting like
a thorn in the feet.

939
00:59:06,057 --> 00:59:07,265
What?

940
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:10,903
Yes. I'm like a thorn.

941
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,189
I'm right before you.

942
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,706
Strangle me first and then you
can go wherever you want to.

943
00:59:14,896 --> 00:59:17,754
Oh, no! You make a
mountain out of a molehill.

944
00:59:17,835 --> 00:59:19,272
Why don't you understand?

945
00:59:19,487 --> 00:59:22,571
Look, Radha. We have to pay
your father to get back our land.

946
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,181
I swear, Radha.

947
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:25,736
I'll go to Kolkata, take
the money from brother Moti..

948
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:27,274
..and come back immediately.

949
00:59:28,654 --> 00:59:32,028
If you go to Kolkata,
you'll never come back.

950
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,596
Why not? That's great. I'm not
going to do farming in Kolkata.

951
00:59:35,677 --> 00:59:37,028
I'll just go there and come back.

952
00:59:38,113 --> 00:59:41,194
But they will not allow you to
come back. - Who? Brother Moti?

953
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:44,112
Then who? Sister-in-law?

954
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:47,407
Then who in Kolkata will stop me?

955
00:59:47,616 --> 00:59:51,874
They stay over there.
- They who?

956
00:59:52,532 --> 00:59:56,978
Witches! They cast a spell on
people. And they get trapped.

957
00:59:57,146 --> 01:00:00,194
Vishwanath's son Shankar
went there. Did he return?

958
01:00:00,278 --> 01:00:01,361
He got trapped over there.

959
01:00:01,442 --> 01:00:03,528
That's it? Such a trivial matter?

960
01:00:03,609 --> 01:00:07,080
All right then. I
won't look at any girl.

961
01:00:07,248 --> 01:00:09,643
You won't, but they will.

962
01:00:10,468 --> 01:00:12,807
One look into their eyes and
you'll be under their spell.

963
01:00:13,033 --> 01:00:15,534
Don't worry. I'll not
look into their eyes.

964
01:00:15,615 --> 01:00:17,277
Do you swear by me?
- I swear by you.

965
01:00:18,195 --> 01:00:19,277
Don't touch me.

966
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:25,194
Rekha!

967
01:00:31,193 --> 01:00:32,277
Rekha?

968
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,778
What foolishness is this?

969
01:00:40,667 --> 01:00:41,789
Listen to me.

970
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,789
I see.

971
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:46,318
So, you were laughing?

972
01:00:46,737 --> 01:00:49,810
And I thought you were..
- Crying. Right?

973
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:51,896
But why should I cry?

974
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,466
Because you went to meet
your brother and sister-in-law?

975
01:00:55,848 --> 01:00:57,569
And once you got there,
you forgot me?

976
01:00:58,819 --> 01:01:01,693
I shouldn't cry over it,
I should get annoyed.

977
01:01:02,113 --> 01:01:04,207
I won't talk to you.

978
01:01:04,557 --> 01:01:07,114
Rekha, you're not aware
that I was in big trouble.

979
01:01:07,445 --> 01:01:10,528
When I got there, I found out
that brother had fixed my marriage.

980
01:01:10,949 --> 01:01:12,148
Really?
- Yes.

981
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:15,736
On my way there, all I could think
of was how to convince brother.

982
01:01:15,862 --> 01:01:18,444
But when I got there, I
had a bigger problem at hand.

983
01:01:18,824 --> 01:01:20,626
You don't know my
brother and sister-in-law.

984
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,910
They scolded me about it.
- And then?

985
01:01:24,115 --> 01:01:25,736
Then? Then what?

986
01:01:25,926 --> 01:01:27,624
He got red with anger and said..

987
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:29,861
"Leave that girl and
get married again."

988
01:01:29,942 --> 01:01:31,277
Oh, really?
- Yes.

989
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:34,141
Well, the girl was also beautiful.

990
01:01:34,362 --> 01:01:37,736
And I thought since brother is
insisting, I should marry her.

991
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:39,322
So, I got married.

992
01:01:40,015 --> 01:01:42,736
You ungrateful man.
- Why?

993
01:01:43,271 --> 01:01:45,319
Couldn't you even send me an invite?

994
01:01:45,892 --> 01:01:47,486
Do you think this is a joke?

995
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:48,879
I'm telling the truth, Rekha.

996
01:01:49,094 --> 01:01:51,361
If you don't believe me..
- Wait. Wait.

997
01:01:52,035 --> 01:01:54,837
The one who was scared to
get married the first time..

998
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:56,649
..will marry a second time?

999
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:59,939
Had I not persuaded daddy..

1000
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,147
..you'd have run
away before the wedding.

1001
01:02:03,258 --> 01:02:04,403
Listen, Rekha.

1002
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,576
Listen to me.

1003
01:02:09,115 --> 01:02:10,611
I won't talk to you.

1004
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:13,528
I'm not asking you to talk to me.

1005
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:17,486
I'm just asking you to come closer.

1006
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:15,724
Mister

1007
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,338
Mister, where does Mr. Moti live?

1008
01:03:21,413 --> 01:03:22,703
Idiot.
- What?

1009
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:25,236
Do I look like a man?

1010
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,323
Oh, God!

1011
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:36,703
Hey!

1012
01:03:39,783 --> 01:03:41,286
Salute, sir.
- Where are you going?

1013
01:03:41,427 --> 01:03:43,884
Brother Moti lives here, right?
- Who is this Moti?

1014
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,400
Mr. Moti. The lawyer.
He's a renowned lawyer.

1015
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:48,844
Yes, he lives here. But
you can't meet him right now.

1016
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:52,861
Why can't I meet him? I'm
his younger brother Shiv.

1017
01:03:53,726 --> 01:03:55,699
Younger brother? Get lost.

1018
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,002
Why are you pushing me?

1019
01:03:59,495 --> 01:04:01,675
Don't touch me! I warn you!

1020
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:02,995
Why are you holding me?

1021
01:04:03,495 --> 01:04:06,630
What is it? - He says he's Mr.
Moti's younger brother.

1022
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:11,536
Are you Mr. Moti's younger brother?
- Yes.

1023
01:04:12,204 --> 01:04:13,286
Hello, Uncle.

1024
01:04:14,489 --> 01:04:16,615
Uncle, my name is Shiv.

1025
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,103
You don't recognise me
because you didn't meet me.

1026
01:04:20,901 --> 01:04:23,967
I see. Please come. Come on.
- Okay.

1027
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:38,195
What is it?

1028
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:40,165
Your younger brother has
come from the village.

1029
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:41,835
My younger brother?

1030
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:44,161
What are you saying?
- Yes.

1031
01:04:44,246 --> 01:04:45,679
I've seated him in
the staff quarters.

1032
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:49,412
Okay.

1033
01:04:58,495 --> 01:04:59,577
Shiv.

1034
01:05:03,537 --> 01:05:05,412
Brother Moti!
- Shiv.

1035
01:05:05,495 --> 01:05:08,183
Brother Moti. - How did you
come here? Who did you come with?

1036
01:05:08,403 --> 01:05:11,161
I came alone.
Can't I come on my own?

1037
01:05:11,246 --> 01:05:12,328
No, that's not the issue.

1038
01:05:12,413 --> 01:05:14,494
But why did you come so
suddenly without informing me?

1039
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,120
What do I say, Brother Moti?

1040
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:18,914
You came away in a hurry and
brother couldn't tell you.

1041
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:22,596
Radha's father Mr. Hari
turned out to be chameleon.

1042
01:05:22,768 --> 01:05:23,824
He changed his colour.

1043
01:05:24,147 --> 01:05:28,785
He told us that if we don't
repay his loan he'd seize our land.

1044
01:05:29,256 --> 01:05:31,153
That's why brother sent me to you.

1045
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:32,866
Yes. To bring the money.

1046
01:05:33,495 --> 01:05:34,577
I see.

1047
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:38,085
Well, don't worry.
You'll get the money.

1048
01:05:38,747 --> 01:05:41,940
But why do you look so pale?
Have you eaten anything?

1049
01:05:42,162 --> 01:05:44,908
No, Brother Moti. I'm famished.

1050
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:47,559
I had to make a lot of
enquires to get here.

1051
01:05:48,495 --> 01:05:51,203
Your father-in-law
has a luxurious house.

1052
01:05:51,495 --> 01:05:54,161
Your father-in-law
is also a nice person.

1053
01:05:54,495 --> 01:05:55,623
Father-in-law?
- Yes.

1054
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:57,161
When did you meet my father-in-law?

1055
01:05:57,468 --> 01:05:59,143
You weren't there when he
returned from the village.

1056
01:05:59,224 --> 01:06:02,411
So what? I just met him.
He seated me here.

1057
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,040
He is wearing such
wonderful clothes.

1058
01:06:05,624 --> 01:06:07,325
And his turban is great.

1059
01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:09,301
Turban?
- Yes.

1060
01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:15,078
What? What happened?

1061
01:06:15,287 --> 01:06:18,494
Nothing. Idiot, he's
not my father-in-law.

1062
01:06:18,578 --> 01:06:20,869
He's Shambhu, my
father-in-law's servant.

1063
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,786
Servant?
- Yes.

1064
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:26,494
If your father-in-law's servant
wears such wonderful clothes..

1065
01:06:26,578 --> 01:06:29,157
..then what kind of clothes
your father-in-law must be having?

1066
01:06:29,954 --> 01:06:32,036
Okay, fine. Sit here.
I'll get food for you.

1067
01:06:32,162 --> 01:06:35,494
No, Brother. I'll eat later.
Let me meet sister-in-law first.

1068
01:06:35,713 --> 01:06:37,953
I want to meet sister-in-law.
I want to take here back.

1069
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:39,995
Elder sister-in-law said so.
Come on. - Listen. - Yes.

1070
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,203
Listen.
- Yes.

1071
01:06:41,284 --> 01:06:46,286
Look, do one thing. Sit here.
I'll bring Rekha here. - Okay.

1072
01:06:49,954 --> 01:06:53,002
This is great. You're
in a ceremonial dress.

1073
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:54,494
Rekha? She's here.

1074
01:06:54,578 --> 01:06:57,699
Rekha, meet Mr. Johnson. - Hello.

1075
01:06:58,149 --> 01:07:00,828
Happy birthday to you. And
please accept this from me.

1076
01:07:00,954 --> 01:07:03,758
And he's Mr. Sarkar.
My daughter Rekha.

1077
01:07:03,898 --> 01:07:05,036
Hello.
- Where's your son-in-law?

1078
01:07:05,117 --> 01:07:06,245
Oh, Moti?
- Yes.

1079
01:07:06,329 --> 01:07:07,412
Moti.

1080
01:07:07,578 --> 01:07:09,673
He's here.
- Hello, Moti. How are you?

1081
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:11,161
Are you keeping well?
- Yes.

1082
01:07:11,242 --> 01:07:12,953
I'm sure he'll take your
place one of these days.

1083
01:07:13,037 --> 01:07:15,664
That's my ambition.
- Very good. - Come on.

1084
01:07:15,893 --> 01:07:17,010
Please come.

1085
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:19,078
Hello.

1086
01:07:20,611 --> 01:07:21,577
Listen, Rekha.

1087
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:22,786
Excuse me.

1088
01:07:23,495 --> 01:07:25,925
What is it? - Come with me.
I want to show you something.

1089
01:07:26,317 --> 01:07:27,941
What?
- Just come. Come on.

1090
01:07:37,162 --> 01:07:38,245
Shiv.

1091
01:07:39,607 --> 01:07:42,287
This is your sister-in-law.
My younger brother.

1092
01:07:42,582 --> 01:07:44,835
Oh, my God!

1093
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:50,214
Sister-in-law,
you're really beautiful.

1094
01:07:50,495 --> 01:07:53,492
I've never seen anyone
as beautiful as you.

1095
01:07:54,085 --> 01:07:56,115
What are you looking at?

1096
01:07:56,594 --> 01:07:59,539
Come on. Pack your things.
I've come to take you.

1097
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,823
Shiv, be seated.

1098
01:08:04,129 --> 01:08:09,160
Rekha, did you see him?
- Did you call me to show this?

1099
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:13,203
Don't feel bad, Rekha. Shiv
has come from the village.

1100
01:08:13,415 --> 01:08:15,336
He doesn't know the
ways of our society.

1101
01:08:15,537 --> 01:08:17,038
But he is pure at heart.

1102
01:08:18,162 --> 01:08:20,820
He's very hungry. Please
bring some food for him.

1103
01:08:21,144 --> 01:08:22,616
Why don't you do that?

1104
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,282
There comes Rekha.

1105
01:08:25,578 --> 01:08:29,249
What's this Rekha? Will you play
hide-n-seek on this day as well?

1106
01:08:29,742 --> 01:08:32,430
Yes, Rekha. This is too much.
We must celebrate. - No, please.

1107
01:08:32,511 --> 01:08:34,953
Yes. Come on. Come on. - Stop
being stubborn. Come to the piano.

1108
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:37,761
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be quiet.

1109
01:08:37,843 --> 01:08:39,850
Ms. Rekha will
oblige us with a song.

1110
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,345
Give her a hand, folks.

1111
01:08:47,108 --> 01:08:51,755
Brother, did
sister-in-law get angry?

1112
01:08:52,858 --> 01:08:55,889
No, Shiv. Why would she get angry?

1113
01:08:56,572 --> 01:08:59,277
Shiv, the problem is that your
sister-in-law is from the city.

1114
01:08:59,548 --> 01:09:01,578
She doesn't know the
ways of our village.

1115
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:04,609
As it is, Shiv, you
shouldn't have sat in that chair.

1116
01:09:05,743 --> 01:09:08,424
Well, forget it. Sit here.
I'll be right back.

1117
01:09:08,733 --> 01:09:09,899
And listen.
- Yes?

1118
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:12,045
Don't wonder around. Okay?

1119
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:59,107
"Love has been kindled."

1120
01:09:59,796 --> 01:10:05,029
"Let's be happy about it."

1121
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:11,174
"After many years of waiting.."

1122
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:16,577
"..this evening has
arrived in our lives."

1123
01:10:17,345 --> 01:10:21,977
"Love has been kindled."

1124
01:10:22,498 --> 01:10:26,908
"Let's be happy about it."

1125
01:10:27,595 --> 01:10:32,190
"After many years of waiting.."

1126
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:37,274
"..this evening has
arrived in our lives."

1127
01:11:07,793 --> 01:11:13,187
"Our bodies and
souls have become one."

1128
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:17,857
"As if fragrance in spring."

1129
01:11:18,266 --> 01:11:23,694
"Our bodies and
souls have become one."

1130
01:11:23,877 --> 01:11:28,172
"As if fragrance in spring."

1131
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,733
"The past, like the moonlight.."

1132
01:11:34,095 --> 01:11:39,315
"..is shining bright on our faces."

1133
01:11:39,603 --> 01:11:48,857
"Let's wander into
some beautiful memory."

1134
01:11:49,566 --> 01:11:54,533
"After many years of waiting.."

1135
01:11:54,701 --> 01:11:59,389
"..this evening has
arrived in our lives."

1136
01:11:59,922 --> 01:12:04,786
"Love has been kindled."

1137
01:12:05,234 --> 01:12:09,999
"Let's be happy about it."

1138
01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:15,140
"After many years of waiting.."

1139
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:20,330
"..this evening has
arrived in our lives."

1140
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,601
"The eyes twinkled."

1141
01:12:52,682 --> 01:12:55,315
"Trapped under the eyelids.."

1142
01:12:55,728 --> 01:12:59,857
"..are many beautiful dreams."

1143
01:13:00,234 --> 01:13:02,774
"The eyes twinkled."

1144
01:13:02,858 --> 01:13:05,642
"Trapped under the eyelids.."

1145
01:13:05,858 --> 01:13:10,195
"..are many beautiful dreams."

1146
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:12,883
"Only for a few moments.."

1147
01:13:12,964 --> 01:13:21,046
"..the times gone by
took shape before us."

1148
01:13:21,234 --> 01:13:30,720
"Call out to those moments
of the past in excitement."

1149
01:13:31,316 --> 01:13:36,017
"After many years of waiting.."

1150
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:40,637
"..this evening has
arrived in our lives."

1151
01:13:41,402 --> 01:13:46,092
"Love has been kindled."

1152
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:50,892
"Let's be happy about it."

1153
01:13:51,448 --> 01:13:55,889
"After many years of waiting.."

1154
01:13:56,343 --> 01:14:01,605
"..this evening has
arrived in our lives."

1155
01:14:30,525 --> 01:14:32,029
What is going on?

1156
01:14:34,525 --> 01:14:36,607
Stop! Stop!
- Who is he?

1157
01:14:36,775 --> 01:14:38,069
Who is he?

1158
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:39,440
Moti! Moti!

1159
01:14:39,566 --> 01:14:40,649
Move!

1160
01:14:40,775 --> 01:14:43,485
Rekha, how does Moti know him?

1161
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:46,739
Daddy, he's a servant at his house.
- What?

1162
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,233
But how come he is here?

1163
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,707
Let's go, Shiv.

1164
01:14:55,006 --> 01:14:57,024
Didn't I tell you not to
come out of this room?

1165
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,018
Why did you come out? You..

1166
01:15:00,706 --> 01:15:02,826
Shambhu, bring some food for Shiv.

1167
01:15:06,749 --> 01:15:08,322
Are you hurt?

1168
01:15:09,351 --> 01:15:11,877
No, Brother. Not at all.

1169
01:15:13,135 --> 01:15:15,440
Okay, sit here.

1170
01:15:18,858 --> 01:15:20,484
Now, we are suspicious.

1171
01:15:20,565 --> 01:15:22,994
I wonder what kind of
samples there are at your in-laws.

1172
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:25,216
Look, Mr. Moti is here.

1173
01:15:26,112 --> 01:15:29,716
Mr. Moti, your servant is very
interesting. I was really scared.

1174
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:31,565
Stop it!

1175
01:15:33,748 --> 01:15:37,149
He's not a servant.
He's my younger brother.

1176
01:15:37,483 --> 01:15:39,111
Brother?
- Yes, my real brother.

1177
01:15:48,613 --> 01:15:49,767
Give me that.

1178
01:15:57,650 --> 01:15:59,135
Shiv?

1179
01:16:02,316 --> 01:16:03,478
Shiv?

1180
01:16:13,526 --> 01:16:16,004
Moti, did you find your brother?

1181
01:16:17,484 --> 01:16:20,155
No.
- Really. It was disgraceful.

1182
01:16:20,983 --> 01:16:22,999
Not in my wildest
dreams did I think..

1183
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,558
..that Rekha would say such things.

1184
01:16:25,067 --> 01:16:26,874
No matter what, we are relatives.

1185
01:16:27,503 --> 01:16:28,936
She's really a stupid girl.

1186
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:32,008
But Moti, you're quite sensible.

1187
01:16:32,174 --> 01:16:33,440
Why did you make such a mistake?

1188
01:16:34,086 --> 01:16:36,315
Before calling your brother
here you should have told him..

1189
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:38,565
..about the society
you are now part of.

1190
01:16:38,931 --> 01:16:41,498
And what kind of a society it is.

1191
01:16:43,449 --> 01:16:47,922
I didn't call him, Daddy. He
came all by himself. - Oh.

1192
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:51,181
I need to talk to
you in this regard.

1193
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:52,760
Yes, tell me.

1194
01:16:54,472 --> 01:16:58,149
Daddy, I need some money.

1195
01:16:58,411 --> 01:17:00,694
Money? By all means.

1196
01:17:00,933 --> 01:17:02,058
How much do you need?

1197
01:17:02,816 --> 01:17:05,587
Around Rs.8000 to Rs.10000.
- That's it?

1198
01:17:06,234 --> 01:17:07,634
I thought..

1199
01:17:08,553 --> 01:17:10,249
But why do you want it?

1200
01:17:13,418 --> 01:17:18,723
You may have seen that the
land I was tilling is ours.

1201
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:22,729
But brother mortgaged that
land to provide for my education.

1202
01:17:24,391 --> 01:17:28,325
He notice had received that If we won't
return his money in three months..

1203
01:17:28,618 --> 01:17:30,015
..then we will lose that land.

1204
01:17:30,428 --> 01:17:31,982
Don't be silly Moti.

1205
01:17:32,351 --> 01:17:35,308
Let go that land.
Why are you getting neverse for that?

1206
01:17:35,888 --> 01:17:37,261
If all you want is land,
then buy a plot in..

1207
01:17:37,408 --> 01:17:41,819
..New Alipore or on VIP
road and build a house.

1208
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:43,817
You're getting me wrong, Daddy.

1209
01:17:44,351 --> 01:17:45,854
I'm not talking about such land..

1210
01:17:46,484 --> 01:17:50,747
..but about the land which
represents the honour of a farmer.

1211
01:17:51,605 --> 01:17:54,405
If a brother staked his
honour for his younger brother..

1212
01:17:54,739 --> 01:17:57,190
..then it's the duty of the
younger brother to get it back.

1213
01:17:57,691 --> 01:18:01,698
Moti, you have a
duty towards us as well.

1214
01:18:02,942 --> 01:18:05,164
I've never said
anything to you till now.

1215
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:07,523
But I'll say it today.

1216
01:18:08,192 --> 01:18:11,376
Now, you should forget
that you're a farmer.

1217
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:14,626
Because you're not
just my junior today..

1218
01:18:15,022 --> 01:18:16,423
..you're my son-in-law too.

1219
01:18:16,913 --> 01:18:19,172
Daddy, I understand
what you're trying to say.

1220
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,650
But my brother, sister-in-law..

1221
01:18:21,734 --> 01:18:23,304
..and the whole family
survives because of that land.

1222
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:26,733
So what? I've seen
their standard of living.

1223
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:29,941
Send them Rs.30 or Rs.40 a month.
They would survive.

1224
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,058
Daddy..
- Am I wrong?

1225
01:18:35,217 --> 01:18:37,697
My brother and
sister-in-law are poor..

1226
01:18:38,555 --> 01:18:39,849
..but they're not beggars.

1227
01:18:41,158 --> 01:18:43,024
They will never accept
the alms I give them.

1228
01:18:43,567 --> 01:18:46,772
But Moti, the money
you're asking from me..

1229
01:18:47,116 --> 01:18:48,739
..would also be considered as alms.

1230
01:18:49,419 --> 01:18:51,835
Because you have not
earned that money.

1231
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:56,267
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1232
01:18:57,109 --> 01:18:58,441
I've made a mistake.

1233
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:18,608
Shiv.

1234
01:19:22,401 --> 01:19:23,650
You've come so soon?

1235
01:19:24,484 --> 01:19:25,566
Yes, Sister-in-law.

1236
01:19:25,983 --> 01:19:28,441
And didn't Moti's wife come along?

1237
01:19:28,818 --> 01:19:30,196
What do I say, sister-in-law?

1238
01:19:30,484 --> 01:19:33,358
Moti's wife packed her things
and was ready to come along.

1239
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:37,515
But I thought if I
bring sister-in-law along..

1240
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:40,632
..who would cook for Brother Moti?

1241
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:42,441
You did the right thing.

1242
01:19:42,818 --> 01:19:45,024
Otherwise, Moti would
have been inconvenienced.

1243
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,372
How is your sister-in-law?
- What?

1244
01:19:49,275 --> 01:19:50,358
She's nice.

1245
01:19:51,312 --> 01:19:52,372
She's very nice.

1246
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,514
I hope she showered
her affection on you.

1247
01:19:55,317 --> 01:19:56,400
Affection?

1248
01:19:57,734 --> 01:19:58,982
What can I say, Sister-in-law?

1249
01:19:59,604 --> 01:20:03,771
She showered me with
so much affection..

1250
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,129
More than you do.

1251
01:20:07,025 --> 01:20:10,379
I see.
- Yes.

1252
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:12,691
She made me sit.

1253
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:15,229
She served food affectionately.

1254
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,899
And in front of all
those rich people..

1255
01:20:17,983 --> 01:20:20,650
..she said that I
was Brother Moti's..

1256
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:25,544
Sister-in-law, I'm famished.

1257
01:20:26,025 --> 01:20:27,108
Give me some food.

1258
01:20:27,484 --> 01:20:29,441
Freshen up. I'll get it right away.

1259
01:20:35,344 --> 01:20:37,547
Shiv, come here.

1260
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,982
Shiv?

1261
01:20:51,987 --> 01:20:54,899
Shiv.. - Shiv, you've
returned from Kolkata?

1262
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:56,817
Sukhiya, go sit there. Go there.

1263
01:21:00,658 --> 01:21:04,608
Shiv, you talked a lot
with your sister-in-law.

1264
01:21:04,818 --> 01:21:06,626
Now, tell me what really happened.

1265
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:09,200
Why are you silent? Speak.

1266
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:10,576
I'll endure everything.

1267
01:21:10,892 --> 01:21:12,374
I got it.

1268
01:21:13,317 --> 01:21:14,483
I understood everything.

1269
01:21:14,806 --> 01:21:16,735
But what's there to be sad about?

1270
01:21:17,233 --> 01:21:21,050
Moti has become a
rich man's son-in-law.

1271
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:24,899
Brother, forget Brother Moti.
- I'll forget him.

1272
01:21:24,983 --> 01:21:26,066
That's not difficult.

1273
01:21:26,816 --> 01:21:30,112
Shiv, I'm glad I didn't educate you.

1274
01:21:30,499 --> 01:21:32,233
To hell with education.

1275
01:21:32,495 --> 01:21:34,885
Teacher! Stop!

1276
01:21:40,628 --> 01:21:43,899
What is it?
- Teacher, don't you have a home?

1277
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,899
Yes, of course. - Then don't you
have a father, mother and siblings?

1278
01:21:46,983 --> 01:21:48,986
Yes, I have everyone.
- Then go home.

1279
01:21:49,067 --> 01:21:52,438
Why are you running our families
by telling us to get educated?

1280
01:21:52,818 --> 01:21:54,550
He's out to educate us!

1281
01:21:55,942 --> 01:21:59,308
Teacher? Teacher.
- What is it, Shiv?

1282
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:01,899
Don't take
brother's words seriously.

1283
01:22:02,219 --> 01:22:05,045
You know that brother
speaks in that manner.

1284
01:22:05,651 --> 01:22:06,733
But what happened?

1285
01:22:06,818 --> 01:22:09,441
Well..  Nothing, Teacher.

1286
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:10,982
Nothing, Teacher.

1287
01:22:56,288 --> 01:22:59,562
The Kolkata returned
gentleman is so angry.

1288
01:23:04,494 --> 01:23:07,448
Shiv, why are you angry?

1289
01:23:07,891 --> 01:23:11,190
I didn't know you'd
return from Kolkata so soon.

1290
01:23:20,059 --> 01:23:23,851
I never thought you love me so much.

1291
01:23:24,014 --> 01:23:27,369
Go away. I didn't
come back early for you.

1292
01:23:28,407 --> 01:23:32,224
What?
- Yes. I was forced to return.

1293
01:23:32,305 --> 01:23:34,169
But now I have to go forever.

1294
01:23:34,764 --> 01:23:36,570
Why?
- Why?

1295
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:39,383
Go ask your miserly father..

1296
01:23:39,546 --> 01:23:43,287
..who has ordered us to repay
within three months. Understood?

1297
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:46,746
Didn't you meet Brother Moti?

1298
01:23:48,478 --> 01:23:49,662
I did.

1299
01:23:51,682 --> 01:23:54,120
Didn't he give you the money?

1300
01:23:55,204 --> 01:23:56,828
You were right, Radha.

1301
01:23:57,641 --> 01:23:59,616
Witches live in Kolkata.

1302
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:03,455
They cast a spell of young guys
and convert them into cowards.

1303
01:24:03,868 --> 01:24:06,345
But listen. I warn you.

1304
01:24:06,478 --> 01:24:08,828
After marrying me, if you
call my brother a servant..

1305
01:24:08,912 --> 01:24:10,949
..then I'll break
your jaw. Understood?

1306
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:12,219
What has happened to you today?

1307
01:24:12,387 --> 01:24:13,953
Why are you saying such things?

1308
01:24:14,713 --> 01:24:16,961
I thought we'd be
meeting after many days.

1309
01:24:17,373 --> 01:24:20,333
We'll have a nice chat.
You'll tell me about Kolkata.

1310
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:24,833
But you want to break my
jaw and what not. Why?

1311
01:24:25,586 --> 01:24:27,271
That's because you're also a woman.

1312
01:24:27,352 --> 01:24:29,398
And all women are the same.

1313
01:24:30,033 --> 01:24:31,370
Except for eldest sister-in-law.

1314
01:24:32,963 --> 01:24:35,987
Look, Shiv, if you
behave like this with me..

1315
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:39,800
..then I warn you, I'll
never come to meet you.

1316
01:24:40,365 --> 01:24:41,704
Radha.

1317
01:24:43,163 --> 01:24:45,454
Radha, why don't you understand?
Brother Moti..

1318
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,370
I couldn't get money
from Brother Moti.

1319
01:24:49,999 --> 01:24:51,291
And we never will.

1320
01:24:51,996 --> 01:24:53,953
That's why I want to go
back to Kolkata again.

1321
01:24:54,662 --> 01:24:56,281
I will earn money over there.

1322
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:58,746
I will get back our land.

1323
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:01,287
This is the only
land we have, Radha.

1324
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,354
I'll have to go to Kolkata.

1325
01:25:03,914 --> 01:25:06,731
No. No. I won't let
you go to Kolkata.

1326
01:25:07,245 --> 01:25:10,370
You just said that that
place is full of witches.

1327
01:25:10,871 --> 01:25:13,646
They will take you away from me.

1328
01:25:13,996 --> 01:25:15,869
I'll never let that happen.
- Radha.

1329
01:25:15,993 --> 01:25:17,203
I'll never let that happen.

1330
01:25:17,891 --> 01:25:22,475
If you leave me, I swear
I'll commit suicide.

1331
01:25:23,506 --> 01:25:24,530
Radha.

1332
01:25:25,747 --> 01:25:27,645
Radha! Radha! Radha!

1333
01:25:37,285 --> 01:25:39,417
Mother-in-law, had I known earlier..

1334
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:41,102
..I'd have come to
receive you at the station.

1335
01:25:41,496 --> 01:25:43,828
Don't bother about
such formalities, Hari.

1336
01:25:44,118 --> 01:25:47,662
Now I'm taking refuge in
Lord Almighty forever.

1337
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:50,662
I thought I should
meet you before leaving.

1338
01:25:50,747 --> 01:25:53,454
And meet Radha as well.
- I see. Very well.

1339
01:25:53,538 --> 01:25:54,794
Mother-in-law, this..

1340
01:25:55,186 --> 01:25:56,277
Grandma!

1341
01:25:58,650 --> 01:25:59,828
Radha!

1342
01:26:00,829 --> 01:26:03,331
Grandma!
- Radha.

1343
01:26:03,412 --> 01:26:04,529
Grandma, when did you come?

1344
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:08,276
Just a while ago.
But where had you been?

1345
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,620
Do you still like the
trees in the jungle?

1346
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:13,828
No, Mother-in-law. She's a grown
up now, but she's still so naīve.

1347
01:26:13,912 --> 01:26:14,995
Be quiet.

1348
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:19,344
What's her fault?

1349
01:26:19,944 --> 01:26:21,514
This is what happens to kids..

1350
01:26:21,595 --> 01:26:24,662
..who lose their
mothers in their childhood.

1351
01:26:25,387 --> 01:26:27,495
Had Shanti been alive today..

1352
01:26:28,509 --> 01:26:29,746
Well, forget it.

1353
01:26:30,829 --> 01:26:33,637
Since I'm renouncing
wealth and worldly attachments..

1354
01:26:34,293 --> 01:26:35,828
..I won't shed any tears.

1355
01:26:35,954 --> 01:26:39,050
Come on, Grandma. I
won't let you go so easily.

1356
01:26:39,538 --> 01:26:41,579
Now, you'll live with me.

1357
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:42,911
No, silly girl.

1358
01:26:43,163 --> 01:26:46,196
Don't drag me back
into this material world.

1359
01:26:46,538 --> 01:26:48,245
Since I've made my
decision to leave..

1360
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:52,620
But mother-in-law, your land..
- I've ended that problem.

1361
01:26:52,747 --> 01:26:55,828
I've given some land to charity
and sold the rest of the land.

1362
01:26:55,954 --> 01:26:58,033
So much land and property..

1363
01:26:58,413 --> 01:26:59,512
What have you done?

1364
01:26:59,593 --> 01:27:01,372
I've done the right thing, Hari.

1365
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,828
You should be happy that I
gave everything in charity..

1366
01:27:03,912 --> 01:27:05,772
..and added to my virtues.

1367
01:27:06,038 --> 01:27:10,620
Did you think I'd write it all to
you and you'd reap the benefits?

1368
01:27:11,321 --> 01:27:15,037
Look, son. You shouldn't
desire wealth of your in-laws.

1369
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:17,287
Understood? - What are
you saying, Mother-in-law?

1370
01:27:17,368 --> 01:27:18,953
Son, I'm saying the right thing.

1371
01:27:19,829 --> 01:27:22,662
Mother-in-law, you
always get me wrong.

1372
01:27:22,747 --> 01:27:27,245
Yes, Hari. I understand
you very well and I know you.

1373
01:27:27,371 --> 01:27:31,620
Your whole life has been
spent accumulating money.

1374
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:32,828
Mother-in-law,
you're really amazing.

1375
01:27:32,996 --> 01:27:35,120
Well, forget it. These
things don't matter much.

1376
01:27:35,246 --> 01:27:37,293
Let me finish the
work I came here for.

1377
01:27:37,374 --> 01:27:38,746
Dear, give me my box.

1378
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:40,232
Give it to me.

1379
01:27:40,829 --> 01:27:41,911
Here you are, Grandma.

1380
01:27:42,246 --> 01:27:45,291
I've brought this with utmost care.
- Yes, Mother-in-law.

1381
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:51,113
This is for my journey expenses.
- I see.

1382
01:27:51,251 --> 01:27:52,363
Listen.
- Yes.

1383
01:27:52,444 --> 01:27:56,377
I've written off 15 acres of land
in Radha's name. - I see. I see.

1384
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:58,612
Here's the paperwork. Read it.
- Okay.

1385
01:28:00,121 --> 01:28:03,575
And here's Rs.10000.

1386
01:28:03,969 --> 01:28:06,710
Give it to me. - Don't touch it.
It's not for you. - Okay.

1387
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:07,910
It's for Radha.

1388
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:11,438
Don't spend a penny from
this on Radha's wedding.

1389
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:14,199
No, Mother-in-law. I won't
spend a penny from it. - Yes.

1390
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:17,418
Radha can spend this money
as per her wishes. - Okay.

1391
01:28:17,499 --> 01:28:18,746
Understood?
- Yes.

1392
01:28:18,829 --> 01:28:21,662
Radha, here are the keys.

1393
01:28:22,621 --> 01:28:25,846
Take this money and keep
it in the safe yourself.

1394
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:27,370
Yes. - Is that okay,
Mother-in-law? - Yes, absolutely.

1395
01:28:27,954 --> 01:28:29,965
Take it.
- Take this, dear. Keep it safe.

1396
01:28:30,121 --> 01:28:33,120
But grandma, will go today itself?
- Yes, dear.

1397
01:28:33,829 --> 01:28:36,109
I have to catch the
10pm train from Patna.

1398
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:38,530
And I'll be visiting
the landlord as well.

1399
01:28:38,611 --> 01:28:42,033
Mother-in-law is right.
Never delay a good deed.

1400
01:28:42,204 --> 01:28:45,953
Keep this money in the safe
quickly, dear. Go quickly. Quickly.

1401
01:28:47,538 --> 01:28:49,870
But mother-in-law, what's the hurry?

1402
01:28:49,954 --> 01:28:51,828
You could have
rested for a day or two.

1403
01:28:51,912 --> 01:28:55,911
Well, since you've decided to
leave, I'll see you off to Patna.

1404
01:28:55,996 --> 01:28:57,748
But why should you take the trouble?

1405
01:28:57,829 --> 01:29:00,579
How would Radha live
alone in such a big house?

1406
01:29:00,663 --> 01:29:03,746
Mother-in-law, she is always alone.

1407
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:06,620
Because I visit Patna quite
often because of my business.

1408
01:29:06,701 --> 01:29:08,579
Well, there's nothing to worry.

1409
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:11,953
I'll ask Sunderlal to sleep
in the house at night. Okay?

1410
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:13,242
Then it's fine.

1411
01:29:18,291 --> 01:29:22,567
You're taking it too easy.

1412
01:29:23,583 --> 01:29:26,686
Hurry up. It's 7:30pm.

1413
01:29:28,829 --> 01:29:30,291
May I say something, Rekha?

1414
01:29:31,905 --> 01:29:35,059
If you don't mind, you
should go to the party alone?

1415
01:29:36,076 --> 01:29:37,261
I'm not feeling well today.

1416
01:29:38,176 --> 01:29:39,809
I know you're making an excuse.

1417
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,089
What has happened to
you these few days?

1418
01:29:43,592 --> 01:29:45,387
You're always so gloomy.

1419
01:29:46,956 --> 01:29:49,036
Come on, get up. Please.

1420
01:29:50,425 --> 01:29:52,249
Don't insist, Rekha.
- What?

1421
01:29:53,811 --> 01:29:55,257
Do you want ..

1422
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:59,923
.. the
society to make fun of me?

1423
01:30:01,537 --> 01:30:06,163
Rekha, the other day you said
you can give up everything for me.

1424
01:30:08,137 --> 01:30:12,619
The society which makes
fun of you because of me..

1425
01:30:13,896 --> 01:30:16,094
..can't you give it up?
- Why not?

1426
01:30:16,428 --> 01:30:18,549
I'll definitely give
it up when needed.

1427
01:30:18,911 --> 01:30:20,427
But come with me today.

1428
01:30:21,538 --> 01:30:24,782
I'm telling the truth, Rekha,
I don't feel quite well today.

1429
01:30:25,347 --> 01:30:27,219
Besides, I've got some
important work to do.

1430
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:29,427
Listen to me and go there alone.

1431
01:30:29,581 --> 01:30:31,746
If anyone asks about me,
tell him I'm not keeping well.

1432
01:30:35,428 --> 01:30:39,125
I know very well what I have
to say when asked about you.

1433
01:30:39,888 --> 01:30:41,882
You don't have to tutor me.

1434
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:45,034
Rekha, listen to me.

1435
01:30:54,511 --> 01:30:55,594
Hello.

1436
01:30:56,012 --> 01:30:57,219
Yes, this is Moti speaking.

1437
01:30:57,428 --> 01:30:58,510
Is this Ramesh?

1438
01:30:58,845 --> 01:31:00,969
I've been waiting
for your phone call.

1439
01:31:01,428 --> 01:31:02,510
Were you able to arrange for it?

1440
01:31:05,179 --> 01:31:06,261
Oh.

1441
01:31:07,095 --> 01:31:08,178
What?

1442
01:31:08,511 --> 01:31:11,261
No, I badly needed that money, so..

1443
01:31:11,637 --> 01:31:12,719
Well, forget it.

1444
01:31:14,845 --> 01:31:16,552
Okay. Yes.

1445
01:32:17,385 --> 01:32:18,749
Shiv.

1446
01:32:20,603 --> 01:32:21,783
Radha?

1447
01:32:24,818 --> 01:32:26,261
What is it, Radha?
- Come out for a moment.

1448
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:27,704
What happened?
- Just come outside.

1449
01:32:27,785 --> 01:32:28,761
Yes, I'm coming.

1450
01:32:42,488 --> 01:32:45,472
Who is it?
- It's nobody, Brother. It is I.

1451
01:32:45,782 --> 01:32:47,793
What is it?
- Nothing, Brother. It's nothing.

1452
01:32:55,852 --> 01:32:56,935
Radha.

1453
01:32:58,769 --> 01:32:59,768
What is it, Radha?

1454
01:33:00,772 --> 01:33:02,100
Come here.
- What is it?

1455
01:33:02,227 --> 01:33:03,309
Just come with me.

1456
01:33:04,143 --> 01:33:05,226
Tell me.

1457
01:33:06,936 --> 01:33:08,017
What is it?

1458
01:33:08,143 --> 01:33:11,563
Shiv, you don't have to
go to Kolkata. - Why not?

1459
01:33:12,852 --> 01:33:16,434
Look at this. - Oh, my God!
Where did you get so much money from?

1460
01:33:16,727 --> 01:33:19,197
This is my money not my father's.

1461
01:33:19,435 --> 01:33:21,146
My grandma gave it to me.

1462
01:33:21,227 --> 01:33:23,309
But I won't take this money.
- Why not?

1463
01:33:23,435 --> 01:33:25,142
I can't take this money, Radha.

1464
01:33:25,395 --> 01:33:28,643
But why? Isn't my
money yours as well?

1465
01:33:28,727 --> 01:33:30,851
That's not the problem,
Radha. Why don't you understand?

1466
01:33:30,936 --> 01:33:33,157
If I take so much money,
what would I tell my brother?

1467
01:33:33,551 --> 01:33:36,768
I don't know that. But don't
tell him I gave it to you.

1468
01:33:36,849 --> 01:33:38,673
That's all right, but
what do I say to him?

1469
01:33:38,754 --> 01:33:40,761
Brother would think
that I stole this money.

1470
01:33:41,018 --> 01:33:43,017
No, Radha. I won't take this money.

1471
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:48,347
Okay. I won't take the money
back home and I won't go either.

1472
01:33:48,602 --> 01:33:50,100
What are you saying, Radha?

1473
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:55,341
Look, my father is not a good man.

1474
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:58,264
I don't know what he asked
your brother to write off.

1475
01:33:58,936 --> 01:34:02,285
If your brother doesn't pay
the money, he'll lose the land.

1476
01:34:02,731 --> 01:34:05,159
What will you do if
you lose your land?

1477
01:34:08,105 --> 01:34:11,171
Look, take this money.

1478
01:34:12,327 --> 01:34:15,531
Otherwise.. otherwise,
I'll commit suicide.

1479
01:34:15,612 --> 01:34:18,184
Oh, no! You always
threaten to do that. Always.

1480
01:34:18,852 --> 01:34:19,935
It's not a threat, Shiv.

1481
01:34:20,484 --> 01:34:24,684
I swear, if you don't take
the money, I'll commit..

1482
01:34:24,769 --> 01:34:25,874
Enough, Radha. That's enough.

1483
01:34:26,393 --> 01:34:27,476
Be quiet.

1484
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:31,392
Don't cry.

1485
01:34:32,012 --> 01:34:35,100
Will you take the money?
- Money?

1486
01:34:35,572 --> 01:34:37,183
But what do I tell brother?

1487
01:34:37,336 --> 01:34:40,599
Say anything that comes to
your mind. Keep the money.

1488
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:42,142
Will you take it?

1489
01:34:44,187 --> 01:34:46,809
Okay, should I leave? It's too late.

1490
01:34:59,223 --> 01:35:00,713
Radha.
- Shiv!

1491
01:35:02,018 --> 01:35:03,100
Shiv!

1492
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:04,601
Shiv!

1493
01:35:06,352 --> 01:35:09,226
I thought I saw someone over there.
- What?

1494
01:35:09,352 --> 01:35:11,139
Oh, no. There's no one.

1495
01:35:11,438 --> 01:35:12,518
What's there to be afraid of?

1496
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:14,935
Come. I'll see you home.

1497
01:35:23,998 --> 01:35:25,824
Parbatiya.
- What?

1498
01:35:26,124 --> 01:35:27,348
Come here.

1499
01:35:33,564 --> 01:35:34,775
What is it?

1500
01:35:35,004 --> 01:35:39,935
I think I should mortgage the
land to Laxmichand, the moneylender.

1501
01:35:40,731 --> 01:35:42,316
That would get Mr. Hari off my back.

1502
01:35:43,797 --> 01:35:45,453
Can I say something?
- What?

1503
01:35:46,323 --> 01:35:48,646
Write a letter to Moti.

1504
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:50,768
I think we have been mistaken..

1505
01:35:50,852 --> 01:35:54,364
Look, don't mention Moti
in front of me. Understood?

1506
01:35:54,877 --> 01:35:58,426
He's a rich man's
son-in-law and we are poor farmers.

1507
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:59,643
Moti.

1508
01:35:59,839 --> 01:36:01,173
Bring my coat.

1509
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:04,193
Brother.
- What is it?

1510
01:36:04,514 --> 01:36:07,170
You don't have to go
anywhere asking for money. - Why?

1511
01:36:09,018 --> 01:36:10,100
Look at this.

1512
01:36:14,734 --> 01:36:15,825
Shiv,

1513
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:18,097
where did you
get so much money from?

1514
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:22,158
Answer me. Where did you
get so much money from?

1515
01:36:22,824 --> 01:36:25,851
No, Brother. It's not what
you think. - Then what is it?

1516
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:27,321
Where did you get
so much money from?

1517
01:36:27,591 --> 01:36:29,267
Answer me. Where did you
get so much money from?

1518
01:36:29,578 --> 01:36:30,518
Speak up, Shiv.

1519
01:36:30,599 --> 01:36:33,017
This money? Brother Moti
sent it. Brother Moti.

1520
01:36:33,101 --> 01:36:34,851
Moti sent it?
Where did you meet him?

1521
01:36:34,996 --> 01:36:38,396
I went out last night.
When you asked, "Who is it?"

1522
01:36:38,699 --> 01:36:41,243
It was Brother Moti's friend.
He gave this to me.

1523
01:36:41,955 --> 01:36:46,729
Shiv, was it Moti's
friend or Moti himself?

1524
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:49,146
No, Sister-in-law. It
was Brother Moti's friend.

1525
01:36:49,227 --> 01:36:51,307
Would that shameless
guy show us his face?

1526
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:55,017
Forget it, brother. Take
this money, go to Mr. Hari..

1527
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,559
..and get our land papers back.

1528
01:36:56,769 --> 01:36:57,931
I'll go to the fields today.

1529
01:36:58,319 --> 01:36:59,351
Sister-in-law, can I
get something to eat?

1530
01:36:59,477 --> 01:37:01,640
No, let it be.
Send it to the fields.

1531
01:37:05,936 --> 01:37:07,017
Where are you lost?

1532
01:37:08,936 --> 01:37:11,601
You're smiling a lot. Hold this.

1533
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,559
Go bring my coat. Go on.

1534
01:37:42,327 --> 01:37:49,029
"Secretly, you and I are
bonded to each other."

1535
01:37:49,503 --> 01:37:54,326
"Where are you going, madam?"

1536
01:37:54,535 --> 01:38:00,685
"Secretly, you and I are
bonded to each other."

1537
01:38:01,035 --> 01:38:04,200
"Where are you going, madam?"

1538
01:38:04,327 --> 01:38:07,408
"This is a bond of love."

1539
01:38:07,492 --> 01:38:13,497
"Secretly, you and I are
bonded to each other."

1540
01:38:13,777 --> 01:38:18,837
"Where are you going, sir?"

1541
01:38:45,546 --> 01:38:48,162
"The one with kohl in your eyes.."

1542
01:38:48,243 --> 01:38:51,885
"..why do you get decked up again?"

1543
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:54,681
"The one with kohl in your eyes.."

1544
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:58,408
"..why do you get decked up again?"

1545
01:38:58,492 --> 01:39:04,678
"Darling, tell me the meaning
of that look before you leave."

1546
01:39:04,759 --> 01:39:08,159
"There's only one meaning."

1547
01:39:08,327 --> 01:39:09,408
"There's only one meaning.."

1548
01:39:09,492 --> 01:39:12,092
"..my eyes are calling for you."

1549
01:39:12,173 --> 01:39:18,037
"Secretly, you and I are
bonded to each other."

1550
01:39:18,221 --> 01:39:21,256
"Where are you going, sir?"

1551
01:39:21,337 --> 01:39:29,195
"Secretly, you and I are
bonded to each other."

1552
01:39:29,541 --> 01:39:33,836
"Where are you going, madam?"

1553
01:40:13,409 --> 01:40:16,134
"Look, the clouds have gathered.."

1554
01:40:16,412 --> 01:40:19,524
"..at the call of the breeze."

1555
01:40:19,826 --> 01:40:22,573
"Look, the clouds have gathered.."

1556
01:40:22,762 --> 01:40:26,242
"..at the call of the breeze."

1557
01:40:26,327 --> 01:40:32,408
"My love has won. My
ignorant lover has lost."

1558
01:40:32,534 --> 01:40:37,447
"It would be great fun..
great fun.."

1559
01:40:37,528 --> 01:40:39,658
"..this game of victory and defeat."

1560
01:40:39,743 --> 01:40:45,966
"Secretly, you and I are
bonded to each other."

1561
01:40:46,047 --> 01:40:48,783
"Where are you going, madam?"

1562
01:40:48,868 --> 01:40:56,830
"Secretly, you and I are
bonded to each other."

1563
01:40:56,971 --> 01:41:01,762
"Where are you going, sir?"

1564
01:41:34,243 --> 01:41:40,408
"Behind the veil, the
face is not fully visible."

1565
01:41:40,492 --> 01:41:46,742
"Behind the veil, the
face is not fully visible."

1566
01:41:46,826 --> 01:41:49,326
"Come in my arms."

1567
01:41:49,451 --> 01:41:52,950
"Let our meeting be complete."

1568
01:41:53,031 --> 01:41:57,408
"This meeting is not.."

1569
01:41:57,492 --> 01:41:59,867
"..just a onetime affair."

1570
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:05,962
"Secretly, you and I are
bonded to each other."

1571
01:42:06,243 --> 01:42:10,995
"Where are you going, sir?
- Where are you going, madam?"

1572
01:42:11,076 --> 01:42:14,242
"This is a bond of love."

1573
01:42:14,327 --> 01:42:20,275
"Secretly, you and I are
bonded to each other."

1574
01:42:20,453 --> 01:42:26,793
"Where are you going, sir?
- Where are you going, madam?"

1575
01:42:43,321 --> 01:42:44,992
As if my Moti has begged for it.

1576
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:46,825
Money.

1577
01:42:47,784 --> 01:42:51,075
Brother Ganga!
- I'm in a hurry! I don't have time!

1578
01:42:51,156 --> 01:42:53,159
Wait! This is important!

1579
01:42:53,285 --> 01:42:55,408
Fool, I was going for
some work and he stopped me.

1580
01:42:55,492 --> 01:42:56,738
Brother Ganga.
- What is it?

1581
01:42:56,819 --> 01:42:58,159
There's bad news.
- What bad news?

1582
01:42:58,243 --> 01:43:00,200
The police inspector is coming.
- What? - Yes.

1583
01:43:00,327 --> 01:43:02,738
Why? - I've heard that
he'll search your house.

1584
01:43:03,035 --> 01:43:04,620
What are you saying?
- The truth.

1585
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:07,622
That's why I came
running to give you the news.

1586
01:43:08,035 --> 01:43:09,555
To search my house?
- Yes.

1587
01:43:10,327 --> 01:43:11,571
Come with me.
- Okay.

1588
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:29,326
There it is, Inspector.

1589
01:43:33,701 --> 01:43:34,783
What is it, sir?

1590
01:43:35,524 --> 01:43:37,655
Gangaram, I have to
search your house.

1591
01:43:37,868 --> 01:43:40,620
Search my house? Sir, why my house?

1592
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:43,491
Listen to that,
Inspector. He acts so ignorant.

1593
01:43:44,132 --> 01:43:45,326
Gangaram.
- Yes?

1594
01:43:45,623 --> 01:43:48,351
Last night, Rs.10000 was
stolen from Mr. Hari's house.

1595
01:43:48,733 --> 01:43:50,829
Your brother Shivram
has stolen that money.

1596
01:43:50,910 --> 01:43:54,700
Sir, it's not true. Shiv
can't do such a thing.

1597
01:43:54,826 --> 01:43:57,326
Yes. He can't do that.

1598
01:43:57,409 --> 01:43:59,658
I've seen it myself, Gangaram.

1599
01:43:59,784 --> 01:44:01,408
Shiv jumped over the compound wall..

1600
01:44:01,492 --> 01:44:03,825
..of Mr. Hari's house last night.

1601
01:44:03,951 --> 01:44:05,034
Yes, sir.

1602
01:44:05,951 --> 01:44:07,765
Last night?
- Yes.

1603
01:44:08,081 --> 01:44:11,015
Let's go, Gangaram. I
have to search your house.

1604
01:44:11,564 --> 01:44:12,787
Wait a minute, sir.

1605
01:44:14,610 --> 01:44:16,976
So, last night he lied to me.

1606
01:44:17,743 --> 01:44:20,533
Sir, there's no need
to search the house.

1607
01:44:20,749 --> 01:44:22,526
There's no need, sir.

1608
01:44:24,327 --> 01:44:27,403
Here's the Rs.10000.
- Look at this. - Here's Rs.10000.

1609
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:30,575
As far as the thief is concerned,
then come with me.

1610
01:44:30,659 --> 01:44:32,243
Let's go.
- Just come with me.

1611
01:44:40,201 --> 01:44:41,284
Shiv.

1612
01:44:41,743 --> 01:44:42,825
Shiv.

1613
01:44:46,801 --> 01:44:48,033
Shiv.
- Yes.

1614
01:44:48,409 --> 01:44:51,947
Did Moti send that money?

1615
01:44:52,589 --> 01:44:54,929
Right? Right?

1616
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:00,222
No brother!
- You fool!

1617
01:45:15,327 --> 01:45:17,242
Brother..
- We'll not spare him.

1618
01:45:17,327 --> 01:45:20,280
Brother, I'm telling the truth.
I didn't steal it.

1619
01:45:20,431 --> 01:45:22,408
Brother, I'm telling the truth.
I didn't steal it.

1620
01:45:22,492 --> 01:45:24,738
Here he is,
Inspector. Take him away.

1621
01:45:24,826 --> 01:45:25,909
Take him away.

1622
01:45:26,035 --> 01:45:27,356
Hang him!
- Get up, Shivram.

1623
01:45:27,510 --> 01:45:29,097
I didn't steal it, brother.

1624
01:45:29,701 --> 01:45:31,590
Brother..
- I'm not your brother.

1625
01:45:31,926 --> 01:45:35,408
Don't ever show us your face.
- Brother.

1626
01:45:35,492 --> 01:45:38,159
We'll think that our Shiv is dead.
- Brother..

1627
01:45:38,243 --> 01:45:39,575
Take him away, Inspector.

1628
01:45:39,713 --> 01:45:42,607
Get him out of my sight.
Take him away.

1629
01:45:42,826 --> 01:45:45,326
Take him away.

1630
01:45:45,618 --> 01:45:47,816
Brother Ganga, have patience.

1631
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:51,893
What is it, Inspector?

1632
01:45:51,974 --> 01:45:54,120
What could it be, Teacher?

1633
01:45:54,201 --> 01:45:58,155
Shivram stole Rs.10000
from Mr. Hari's house.

1634
01:45:58,243 --> 01:46:00,114
Shiv stole the money?
- Yes, Teacher.

1635
01:46:00,195 --> 01:46:03,030
Teacher, I'm telling the truth.
I didn't steal.

1636
01:46:03,247 --> 01:46:05,341
Come on.
- I didn't steal it, Teacher.

1637
01:46:11,329 --> 01:46:12,836
Who is drunk?

1638
01:46:13,752 --> 01:46:15,350
Parbatiya!

1639
01:46:16,539 --> 01:46:18,852
Parbatiya..

1640
01:46:19,386 --> 01:46:22,534
Look at this. She's standing here.

1641
01:46:22,993 --> 01:46:24,605
Parbatiya.

1642
01:46:25,409 --> 01:46:26,491
Parbatiya.

1643
01:46:26,993 --> 01:46:28,200
Did you hear it?

1644
01:46:29,059 --> 01:46:31,606
Your Shiv is a thief.

1645
01:46:32,258 --> 01:46:38,167
He stole Rs.10000.
- That's a lie. I don't believe it.

1646
01:46:38,721 --> 01:46:41,061
Shiv can never steal.

1647
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:45,783
If he can't, then how
did Sunderlal see him?

1648
01:46:47,156 --> 01:46:52,039
Your mother-in-law has given you
such wonderful brothers-in-law.

1649
01:46:53,327 --> 01:46:56,683
One became the live-in
son-in-law of a rich man.

1650
01:46:57,182 --> 01:46:59,127
The other became a thief.

1651
01:47:00,201 --> 01:47:04,640
Parbatiya, I beat him up.
I beat him up badly.

1652
01:47:05,606 --> 01:47:09,072
I beat up Shiv like
an animal in public.

1653
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:13,393
And I warned him, "Don't
ever show us your face."

1654
01:47:14,227 --> 01:47:16,588
"I'll think that
my brother is dead."

1655
01:47:16,669 --> 01:47:21,071
Oh, God!
- Quiet! Quiet! Don't you dare cry!

1656
01:47:21,564 --> 01:47:24,139
Look here. Look at me.

1657
01:47:24,536 --> 01:47:25,533
Am I crying?

1658
01:47:25,932 --> 01:47:27,557
Why should I cry?

1659
01:47:28,409 --> 01:47:30,640
Should I cry over my step-brothers?

1660
01:47:31,395 --> 01:47:32,973
That's why I have beaten him.

1661
01:47:33,533 --> 01:47:34,898
And then consumed drink.

1662
01:47:35,939 --> 01:47:37,876
Didn't I said you?

1663
01:47:38,690 --> 01:47:40,277
That I won't drink.

1664
01:47:40,491 --> 01:47:43,508
But I have drink again. Much more.

1665
01:47:44,205 --> 01:47:46,722
Great my son.

1666
01:47:47,683 --> 01:47:50,520
Oh my Moti.

1667
01:47:51,837 --> 01:47:55,634
Inspector, I assure you
there's something fishy.

1668
01:47:56,036 --> 01:47:57,593
You are the protector of the law.

1669
01:47:57,761 --> 01:48:01,045
I hope an innocent doesn't
get punished by mistake.

1670
01:48:01,345 --> 01:48:04,404
Teacher, why do you forget..

1671
01:48:04,485 --> 01:48:09,306
..that Sunderlal saw
Shivram leave Mr. Hari's house?

1672
01:48:09,487 --> 01:48:10,798
Well, that is fine.

1673
01:48:11,071 --> 01:48:12,944
But I will request you again.

1674
01:48:13,071 --> 01:48:17,444
Meet Mr. Hari's daughter Radha once.

1675
01:48:17,737 --> 01:48:19,082
Radha?
- Yes.

1676
01:48:19,565 --> 01:48:21,399
But how is Radha
connected to this theft?

1677
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:22,527
There is a connection.

1678
01:48:23,983 --> 01:48:26,026
How do I explain to you?

1679
01:48:26,987 --> 01:48:28,986
I see. So, is that the case?
- Yes.

1680
01:48:29,071 --> 01:48:34,070
I'm sure, a meeting with
Radha will lead you to the truth.

1681
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,569
Let me explain to you.

1682
01:48:39,071 --> 01:48:43,694
Actually, the inspector is
coming here to talk to you.

1683
01:48:44,071 --> 01:48:48,152
If you tell him that you
gave Shiv that money..

1684
01:48:48,236 --> 01:48:50,694
..then things will
go terribly wrong.

1685
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:53,070
And then Shiv will be
booked for a greater offence.

1686
01:48:53,232 --> 01:48:55,778
And he'll get a harsher punishment.

1687
01:48:59,153 --> 01:49:02,161
If I gave him the money,
then what's Shiv's crime?

1688
01:49:02,487 --> 01:49:04,277
You'll not understand that.

1689
01:49:04,612 --> 01:49:06,444
You're still a kid. You're immature.

1690
01:49:06,737 --> 01:49:08,152
The inspector will
write in his report..

1691
01:49:08,236 --> 01:49:11,070
..that Shiv misled you and
got the money through you.

1692
01:49:11,297 --> 01:49:13,774
This is not about a
few rupees, Radha.

1693
01:49:13,855 --> 01:49:15,983
This is about Rs.10000.

1694
01:49:18,374 --> 01:49:20,527
What do I have to
say to the inspector?

1695
01:49:20,608 --> 01:49:23,611
Yes. I'll see to it that you
don't have to say anything.

1696
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:25,337
But if the inspector
doesn't listen to me..

1697
01:49:25,471 --> 01:49:28,152
..then just tell him that you
know nothing about the money.

1698
01:49:28,362 --> 01:49:32,330
Then I'll talk to the
inspector and get Shiv released.

1699
01:49:33,071 --> 01:49:34,152
What are you looking at?

1700
01:49:36,349 --> 01:49:37,527
I'm not asking you to
say something wrong.

1701
01:49:38,153 --> 01:49:40,277
This is legal stuff.

1702
01:49:41,071 --> 01:49:42,194
You won't understand.

1703
01:49:45,071 --> 01:49:46,486
I understood, Father.

1704
01:49:46,695 --> 01:49:48,070
Please come, Inspector.

1705
01:49:51,403 --> 01:49:54,070
Dear, the inspector has come.
Wait right here.

1706
01:49:54,153 --> 01:49:55,611
I'll call you when needed.

1707
01:49:59,253 --> 01:50:01,299
Welcome, Inspector.
- Hello. Take a seat.

1708
01:50:01,538 --> 01:50:05,585
It's an honour to have such a
respectable person in my house.

1709
01:50:06,071 --> 01:50:08,070
You are respectable, Mr. Hari.

1710
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:11,152
We're in constant touch
with thieves and criminals.

1711
01:50:11,236 --> 01:50:12,406
Yes, that's fine.

1712
01:50:12,487 --> 01:50:15,361
Sunderlal, arrange for
some snacks for the inspector.

1713
01:50:15,445 --> 01:50:17,053
That's not needed.

1714
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:21,490
Please call your daughter. I'd
like to ask her some questions.

1715
01:50:22,737 --> 01:50:26,313
Inspector, times have changed.

1716
01:50:26,737 --> 01:50:28,152
In the past, women of our family..

1717
01:50:28,236 --> 01:50:30,778
..would never go in
front of outsiders. - Yes.

1718
01:50:30,987 --> 01:50:32,277
You are right.

1719
01:50:32,612 --> 01:50:35,277
But your daughter
is like my daughter.

1720
01:50:35,358 --> 01:50:36,486
Yes, absolutely..

1721
01:50:37,987 --> 01:50:39,235
As you wish.

1722
01:50:40,445 --> 01:50:43,611
Dear Radha. Dear Radha.

1723
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:46,653
Radha, come here, dear. Come here.

1724
01:50:48,695 --> 01:50:52,736
Look, your inspector uncle has
come. Greet him, dear. - Hello.

1725
01:50:53,153 --> 01:50:54,736
He wants to ask you something.

1726
01:50:57,823 --> 01:51:03,277
Radha, I want to ask
you about that Rs.10,000.

1727
01:51:04,153 --> 01:51:07,044
If you know, then tell me the truth.

1728
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:10,444
Yes, dear. Say that you don't
know anything about that money.

1729
01:51:10,528 --> 01:51:13,944
Mr. Hari, I'm asking this
question to your daughter..

1730
01:51:14,487 --> 01:51:15,569
..and not to you.

1731
01:51:16,153 --> 01:51:17,736
Yes, of course. Dear..

1732
01:51:20,737 --> 01:51:25,697
Inspector, I had given..

1733
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:30,513
..that money to Shiv.
- Radha!

1734
01:51:37,153 --> 01:51:39,405
Mr. Hari, I'm going.

1735
01:51:40,428 --> 01:51:43,402
I've found
out whatever I wanted to know.

1736
01:51:50,957 --> 01:51:52,829
Wretched man. Idiot.

1737
01:51:53,154 --> 01:51:54,235
He took Rs.500 from me too..

1738
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,527
He didn't take it,
sir. He returned it.

1739
01:51:57,259 --> 01:52:00,997
It's amazing, sir. That
inspector is very generous.

1740
01:52:01,176 --> 01:52:04,277
But our Radha..
- She has become over-smart.

1741
01:52:05,846 --> 01:52:07,070
Radha!

1742
01:52:07,737 --> 01:52:08,944
Radha!

1743
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:13,357
Brother Ganga.
- Here comes master.

1744
01:52:15,570 --> 01:52:18,944
Welcome. Come, Master.

1745
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:22,487
Did you hear?

1746
01:52:22,913 --> 01:52:28,070
My Shiv..
my step-brother Shivram..

1747
01:52:28,365 --> 01:52:31,235
..committed a theft, he is a thief.

1748
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:32,653
No, Brother Ganga.
- Yes?

1749
01:52:32,737 --> 01:52:34,248
Shiv has not committed the robbery.

1750
01:52:34,403 --> 01:52:36,277
The inspector is
going to release him.

1751
01:52:37,991 --> 01:52:39,235
I have come here to take you.

1752
01:52:39,737 --> 01:52:42,235
What? Master?

1753
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:45,819
Yes. Radha had given
that money to Shiv.

1754
01:52:45,945 --> 01:52:47,472
Radha had given it to Shiv?
- Yes.

1755
01:52:48,071 --> 01:52:49,712
So, Shiv didn't commit the robbery?

1756
01:52:50,445 --> 01:52:51,905
Shiv is not a thief?

1757
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:55,104
Parbatiya. Parbatiya.

1758
01:52:55,786 --> 01:52:57,760
Our Shiv is not a thief.

1759
01:52:57,904 --> 01:52:59,361
Our Shiv is not a thief.

1760
01:53:01,153 --> 01:53:05,733
Master, I've hit him. I
thrashed him real hard, master.

1761
01:53:06,071 --> 01:53:09,175
I hit him like an animal
before the entire village.

1762
01:53:11,699 --> 01:53:14,983
I hit him because
I'm his step-brother.

1763
01:53:15,468 --> 01:53:17,240
Don't cry, brother Ganga. Don't cry.

1764
01:53:17,570 --> 01:53:21,070
Come on. Come to the
police station with me. Come on.

1765
01:53:27,559 --> 01:53:28,778
Shivram, come on.

1766
01:53:31,236 --> 01:53:32,319
Yes. You may go.

1767
01:53:36,023 --> 01:53:37,986
Come in, Master, I
want to talk with you.

1768
01:53:40,987 --> 01:53:42,070
Shiv!

1769
01:53:45,412 --> 01:53:48,478
No. I won't show my face to you.

1770
01:53:48,916 --> 01:53:51,031
You had forbidden me
to show you my face.

1771
01:53:51,654 --> 01:53:56,277
You said that you will
think that your Shiv has died.

1772
01:53:56,362 --> 01:53:57,444
Shiv.

1773
01:53:59,490 --> 01:54:04,235
Shiv, take it. Hit me to
your heart's content, Shiv.

1774
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,786
Hit me before everyone.

1775
01:54:05,987 --> 01:54:07,070
Take it.

1776
01:54:08,433 --> 01:54:09,798
Shiv!

1777
01:54:15,071 --> 01:54:18,948
I'm telling the truth, Sheela. I
don't attend any parties of late.

1778
01:54:19,837 --> 01:54:23,015
No, don't
misunderstand me. It is not so.

1779
01:54:23,096 --> 01:54:25,254
Rekha.
- Excuse me.

1780
01:54:25,987 --> 01:54:27,070
Rekha.

1781
01:54:27,654 --> 01:54:29,916
Rekha, do you know
what consequences..

1782
01:54:30,105 --> 01:54:32,287
..I had to face because of
your childishness today?

1783
01:54:32,654 --> 01:54:35,444
My status, prestige,
position, everything is ruined.

1784
01:54:35,913 --> 01:54:37,819
What happened, Daddy?
- What else?

1785
01:54:38,487 --> 01:54:40,624
The man who was not worth to
become the servant of this house..

1786
01:54:41,001 --> 01:54:42,949
..I made him my son-in-law
because of your stubbornness.

1787
01:54:43,362 --> 01:54:47,683
Daddy? - I ask, how long
will he keep defaming me?

1788
01:54:48,153 --> 01:54:50,541
It was already difficult for me to
face the society because of him..

1789
01:54:50,832 --> 01:54:52,486
..and he put me to
shame at the bar too today.

1790
01:54:53,153 --> 01:54:55,612
Those people who used
to seek help from me..

1791
01:54:55,897 --> 01:54:58,684
He had gone to beg
before them. It's disgusting.

1792
01:54:59,278 --> 01:55:00,736
I'll speak to him, Daddy.

1793
01:55:00,987 --> 01:55:03,694
What will you talk to him now?
He has crossed the limits.

1794
01:55:04,071 --> 01:55:06,569
If he wanted to improve, he
would have improved long ago.

1795
01:55:07,153 --> 01:55:09,926
The appearance of a
man can be changed..

1796
01:55:10,405 --> 01:55:11,986
..by knowledge and get up,
not his character.

1797
01:55:12,071 --> 01:55:13,944
The values of his
family can't be changed.

1798
01:55:14,752 --> 01:55:18,903
The biggest thing is, Rekha,
the genes can't be changed.

1799
01:55:34,781 --> 01:55:35,861
Listen.

1800
01:55:41,143 --> 01:55:43,599
Won't you let me
live peacefully at home?

1801
01:55:43,945 --> 01:55:45,986
Daddy was saying..
- I've heard everything.

1802
01:55:46,307 --> 01:55:49,421
So, is it true that you had
gone to beg from that man?

1803
01:55:50,215 --> 01:55:53,653
Yes. I had gone. Because
your daddy himself had..

1804
01:55:53,737 --> 01:55:56,152
Moti, you think only your
brother and sister-in-law..

1805
01:55:56,236 --> 01:55:59,694
..are respectable, my dad
doesn't have any respect?

1806
01:56:01,862 --> 01:56:02,923
Rekha,

1807
01:56:04,066 --> 01:56:06,070
your daddy is not
only my father-in-law..

1808
01:56:07,153 --> 01:56:08,235
..but my guru too.

1809
01:56:09,904 --> 01:56:14,235
Perhaps no one will
respect him as me.

1810
01:56:16,285 --> 01:56:18,377
My brother and
sister-in-law are illiterates..

1811
01:56:19,302 --> 01:56:24,277
..but if you make some mistake they
will abuse you, not your family.

1812
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:25,819
Not your blood.

1813
01:56:26,824 --> 01:56:28,486
But your daddy is not an illiterate.

1814
01:56:28,654 --> 01:56:30,152
He is educated. He is cultured,
in spite of it..

1815
01:56:30,236 --> 01:56:33,747
Listen, Moti, you
always criticise daddy..

1816
01:56:34,286 --> 01:56:35,808
..but you forget that
today too you depend..

1817
01:56:36,053 --> 01:56:38,486
..on him to feed you twice a day.

1818
01:56:38,570 --> 01:56:39,653
Rekha!

1819
01:57:01,236 --> 01:57:02,319
Where have they both gone?

1820
01:57:03,218 --> 01:57:05,903
Baby is not feeling well,
she won't eat food.

1821
01:57:06,737 --> 01:57:09,235
And son-in-law has
left the house forever.

1822
01:57:09,953 --> 01:57:12,120
What? He has left the house?

1823
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,979
Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

1824
01:57:15,473 --> 01:57:17,443
After all,
son-in-law is a farmer's son.

1825
01:57:17,956 --> 01:57:19,778
A farmer's blood runs in his veins.

1826
01:57:20,226 --> 01:57:23,575
The farmer who toils
round-the-clock to feed the people..

1827
01:57:23,977 --> 01:57:25,394
..how can he bear if he is taunted..

1828
01:57:25,475 --> 01:57:27,891
..about being fed twice a day?
- Shut up!

1829
01:57:29,146 --> 01:57:30,860
You are talking too much.

1830
01:57:38,899 --> 01:57:40,098
Shiv!

1831
01:57:50,697 --> 01:57:51,883
I was searching you.

1832
01:57:52,203 --> 01:57:53,592
Why? What's the matter?

1833
01:57:54,019 --> 01:57:57,224
Radha has called you. She is
sitting at Lord Shiva temple.

1834
01:58:02,113 --> 01:58:04,314
Okay, you go. I'm coming.

1835
01:58:10,593 --> 01:58:11,855
Radha!

1836
01:58:14,934 --> 01:58:16,016
Radha!

1837
01:58:17,411 --> 01:58:18,671
Radha!

1838
01:58:20,642 --> 01:58:21,725
You.

1839
01:58:21,809 --> 01:58:26,224
Yes, Shivram. Radha was
feeling shy to say this to you..

1840
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:27,853
..that's why I had to come.

1841
01:58:28,190 --> 01:58:31,224
Actually, Shivram, I
can't marry Radha with you.

1842
01:58:31,308 --> 01:58:32,658
It is a question of my respect.

1843
01:58:32,739 --> 01:58:34,750
And I can't see Radha unhappy too.

1844
01:58:34,831 --> 01:58:38,725
She has agreed to marry a boy of
my choice with great difficulty.

1845
01:58:39,201 --> 01:58:41,329
Yes, but she has laid a condition..

1846
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:45,090
..that I will have to return
your land without taking a penny.

1847
01:58:45,434 --> 01:58:48,307
Of course. Look, I have
brought the documents too.

1848
01:58:53,059 --> 01:58:54,415
Has Radha said this?

1849
01:58:54,496 --> 01:58:58,066
Then am I lying? It is the
matter of my daughter's happiness.

1850
01:58:58,147 --> 01:59:00,224
Otherwise it is not a joke
to let go Rs.7000-Rs.8,000..

1851
01:59:00,308 --> 01:59:02,307
..in today's world, Shivram.

1852
01:59:02,392 --> 01:59:03,975
But I have one condition too.

1853
01:59:07,059 --> 01:59:08,142
Tell me.

1854
01:59:08,658 --> 01:59:11,659
I will return your land but
you will have to go away..

1855
01:59:12,193 --> 01:59:16,681
..from the village
till Radha gets married.

1856
01:59:17,145 --> 01:59:20,343
If you need more money for it,
I'm ready to give that too.

1857
01:59:22,642 --> 01:59:26,175
All right. I will leave
the village.

1858
01:59:27,668 --> 01:59:29,019
I promise you.

1859
01:59:30,112 --> 01:59:33,297
I knew, Son. Take the documents.

1860
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:41,224
No. We are poor
farmers but not beggars.

1861
01:59:42,926 --> 01:59:47,234
Instead of two-three months,
give me one year's time.

1862
01:59:47,989 --> 01:59:51,058
I will earn money and
get my land released.

1863
01:59:51,271 --> 01:59:56,144
Son, forget about one year,
I'll give you three years time.

1864
01:59:56,225 --> 01:59:58,812
Repay my loan
whenever you get money.

1865
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:01,307
Anyway, I was ready to
give you the land right now.

1866
02:00:05,026 --> 02:00:10,404
"The land calls out."

1867
02:00:10,912 --> 02:00:17,401
"The land calls out."

1868
02:00:23,461 --> 02:00:30,064
"I feel like mocking
over this strange matter."

1869
02:00:32,336 --> 02:00:38,084
"I feel like mocking
over this strange matter."

1870
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:43,834
"My dear ones are
ashamed of my soil."

1871
02:00:43,918 --> 02:00:49,917
"Why do I have these
worthless illusions?"

1872
02:00:50,002 --> 02:00:55,485
"My everything belongs to
one who touches me lovingly."

1873
02:00:55,566 --> 02:01:00,539
"The land calls out."

1874
02:01:01,252 --> 02:01:05,082
"The land calls out."
- Hey? What are you doing, Brother?

1875
02:01:05,755 --> 02:01:08,556
Sir, shall I clean it?

1876
02:01:10,105 --> 02:01:13,866
All right, do it. But don't
steal anything. - No, sir.

1877
02:01:15,874 --> 02:01:21,229
"I'm looking forward
with hopeful eyes.."

1878
02:01:22,835 --> 02:01:23,917
Hey?

1879
02:01:27,669 --> 02:01:28,752
What is this?

1880
02:01:29,489 --> 02:01:32,701
I don't have another
cloth to clean it, sir.

1881
02:01:34,090 --> 02:01:35,850
I think you have newly
arrived to this city.

1882
02:01:35,931 --> 02:01:39,176
No, sir, I didn't come
flying but by the train.

1883
02:01:40,006 --> 02:01:41,872
I want to earn money.
- I see.

1884
02:01:42,386 --> 02:01:45,827
Yes, sir. I want to earn
money and get my land released.

1885
02:01:46,321 --> 02:01:48,997
My land is mortgaged
with the landlord.

1886
02:01:54,408 --> 02:01:57,245
You will get your land
released by cleaning the cars?

1887
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:04,585
Brother, I had come to this
city one day with this dream.

1888
02:02:05,839 --> 02:02:09,822
I thought I'll earn money
and get my land released..

1889
02:02:10,695 --> 02:02:14,959
..but that dream was
shattered and I lost my land too.

1890
02:02:16,807 --> 02:02:19,418
Why are you so shocked?
I am telling the truth.

1891
02:02:19,873 --> 02:02:21,979
Not only you or me,
lakhs of farmers like us..

1892
02:02:22,533 --> 02:02:26,138
..had come to this
city with this dream.

1893
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:31,932
Someone became a coolie, a
worker or a rickshaw driver.

1894
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:34,744
But no one returned back.

1895
02:02:35,912 --> 02:02:39,168
Everyone is struggling hard in
this city and breathing their last.

1896
02:02:39,588 --> 02:02:41,764
Sir..
- Did you panic?

1897
02:02:42,667 --> 02:02:43,668
Did you get scared
on hearing the truth?

1898
02:02:43,753 --> 02:02:46,710
No, sir. I will have to earn money.

1899
02:02:47,141 --> 02:02:48,917
I will have to get my land released.

1900
02:02:49,389 --> 02:02:50,959
I've been given one year's time.

1901
02:02:51,451 --> 02:02:53,907
I see. How much will
you be able to earn..

1902
02:02:53,988 --> 02:02:55,668
..by cleaning the cars in one year?

1903
02:02:57,487 --> 02:02:59,879
Okay, do you know to drive?

1904
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:02,192
Yes, sir. I can drive
the bullock-cart very well.

1905
02:03:02,273 --> 02:03:05,148
I'm not talking about the
bullock-cart but taxi, motorcar.

1906
02:03:05,796 --> 02:03:08,436
But I've never seen
this in my village, sir.

1907
02:03:09,872 --> 02:03:12,672
But it is the only way for
you to earn some more money.

1908
02:03:12,856 --> 02:03:14,644
But who will teach me?

1909
02:03:15,376 --> 02:03:17,172
I don't even have a
place to stay here.

1910
02:03:17,253 --> 02:03:19,346
I see. So, you depend
on the care of footpath.

1911
02:03:20,172 --> 02:03:21,440
Never mind, buddy.

1912
02:03:21,759 --> 02:03:23,172
My
dream has not fulfilled..

1913
02:03:23,437 --> 02:03:25,668
..but let's try to
fulfil your dream.

1914
02:03:25,753 --> 02:03:27,251
Come with me.
- Where, sir?

1915
02:03:27,336 --> 02:03:28,418
To my mansion.

1916
02:03:28,732 --> 02:03:30,623
Three-four wrestlers like
you are already present there.

1917
02:03:30,753 --> 02:03:32,995
Really?
- Yes. Sit.

1918
02:03:36,038 --> 02:03:37,123
Wait.

1919
02:03:40,308 --> 02:03:42,897
First, promise me.
- What, sir?

1920
02:03:44,990 --> 02:03:47,396
If you are able to
earn money in your life..

1921
02:03:48,391 --> 02:03:49,917
..you will return to your village.

1922
02:03:51,828 --> 02:03:53,666
If you are unable to
get that land released..

1923
02:03:54,367 --> 02:03:55,752
..you will buy another plot of land.

1924
02:03:56,735 --> 02:03:58,526
You will not die on the
footpath of this city..

1925
02:03:59,090 --> 02:04:01,997
..but in your village, on your land.

1926
02:04:03,623 --> 02:04:06,748
I promise. I promise.
- Sit.

1927
02:04:07,835 --> 02:04:09,126
Let it be, Uncle.

1928
02:04:09,605 --> 02:04:11,969
In today's world
and in our society..

1929
02:04:12,259 --> 02:04:14,168
..why do you have to
think of this and worry?

1930
02:04:14,575 --> 02:04:17,081
I see. I know, Ashok.

1931
02:04:17,377 --> 02:04:21,418
But actually, this girl is
stubborn like her mother.

1932
02:04:22,921 --> 02:04:28,374
Sometimes I feel that her
thinking is very old-fashioned.

1933
02:04:29,405 --> 02:04:31,787
You know, Ashok, your aunt never..

1934
02:04:31,868 --> 02:04:34,132
..compromised with me in her life.

1935
02:04:35,118 --> 02:04:37,737
And this girl has
got the same nature.

1936
02:04:38,088 --> 02:04:39,743
Not only aunt, she
must be affected..

1937
02:04:39,824 --> 02:04:41,627
..by that man's company too.

1938
02:04:42,379 --> 02:04:45,216
Let some time pass. Everything
will be normal automatically.

1939
02:04:46,193 --> 02:04:50,359
By thinking this, I told your
daddy to call you here from abroad.

1940
02:04:51,640 --> 02:04:53,031
Perhaps you don't know, Ashok..

1941
02:04:53,707 --> 02:04:57,439
..your daddy and I had
seen this dream long before..

1942
02:04:58,176 --> 02:04:59,323
..that you and Rekha..

1943
02:05:00,466 --> 02:05:02,456
Rekha?
- Come, Rekha.

1944
02:05:05,752 --> 02:05:07,838
Hello, Ashok.
- Hello, Rekha.

1945
02:05:08,825 --> 02:05:12,195
You both sit and talk.
Till then I'll go and change.

1946
02:05:15,786 --> 02:05:16,991
Please be seated.

1947
02:05:17,772 --> 02:05:20,532
Your daddy seems very disturbed.

1948
02:05:21,142 --> 02:05:22,472
Don't worry about it.

1949
02:05:24,408 --> 02:05:26,616
Why did you return from
abroad all of a sudden?

1950
02:05:27,161 --> 02:05:29,013
I had heard that you
will settle there.

1951
02:05:29,243 --> 02:05:31,407
I had this intention. But
I received daddy's letter..

1952
02:05:31,491 --> 02:05:33,407
..all of a sudden, in
which it was written..

1953
02:05:33,491 --> 02:05:35,329
..that I am appointed as
your daddy's junior here.

1954
02:05:36,204 --> 02:05:37,657
And uncle was also saying that..

1955
02:05:37,742 --> 02:05:39,949
Have tea.
- Thank you.

1956
02:05:42,703 --> 02:05:47,283
I think it's not good for you to
remain indoors round-the-clock.

1957
02:05:47,773 --> 02:05:50,292
You should go for outings.
You should enjoy.

1958
02:05:50,775 --> 02:05:52,338
I've also heard that
you have stopped..

1959
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:55,241
..attending any parties nowadays.

1960
02:05:55,909 --> 02:05:58,121
You have returned
just a few days back..

1961
02:05:58,563 --> 02:06:01,670
..but it seems you have
come to know a lot about me.

1962
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:04,250
Why not? Your daddy has
told me a little about you..

1963
02:06:04,591 --> 02:06:07,741
..and you know such
rumours do spread in our society.

1964
02:06:09,120 --> 02:06:13,109
It is reason for which I've stopped
attending the parties, Ashok.

1965
02:06:13,359 --> 02:06:14,847
It is fine but still..

1966
02:06:14,928 --> 02:06:17,699
Baby, there is madam
Sheela's call for you.

1967
02:06:18,798 --> 02:06:22,199
Excuse me. Please sit, I
think daddy must be coming.

1968
02:06:28,896 --> 02:06:30,702
That will be sorted out, Sunder.

1969
02:06:30,962 --> 02:06:32,195
That is fine, sir.

1970
02:06:32,276 --> 02:06:35,379
But Mr. Choudhary of
Chandanpur is very old.

1971
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:38,320
Sunderlal, not the age
but the family matters..

1972
02:06:38,453 --> 02:06:40,544
..while fixing a marriage.

1973
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:41,946
One has to care for the status.

1974
02:06:42,196 --> 02:06:45,170
I have fixed the date too.
Tenth of the next month.

1975
02:06:45,251 --> 02:06:49,284
Really?
- Yes. Sir, do you know something?

1976
02:06:49,537 --> 02:06:53,649
Forget about giving any
dowry at our Radha's wedding..

1977
02:06:53,730 --> 02:06:58,824
..he will shoulder for the wedding
expenses of both the parties.

1978
02:06:59,244 --> 02:07:03,490
I see. So, this is the real thing.
- Yes. What say?

1979
02:07:17,511 --> 02:07:21,127
I couldn't find out anything.
I couldn't find out anything.

1980
02:07:21,284 --> 02:07:22,908
Kolkata is a strange city.

1981
02:07:23,117 --> 02:07:25,199
I drive the bullock-cart.

1982
02:07:25,331 --> 02:07:28,116
If you ask this to
anyone in the village..

1983
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:29,541
..he will tell you who is Sukhiya.

1984
02:07:29,795 --> 02:07:32,582
He drives a motor here
but no one knows him.

1985
02:07:33,284 --> 02:07:35,575
I don't understand
what will happen now.

1986
02:07:36,863 --> 02:07:40,915
Brother Sukhiya, how much
trouble will you take for me?

1987
02:07:41,418 --> 02:07:43,199
Let me board the train for Kashi.

1988
02:07:43,955 --> 02:07:47,700
I will go to grandmother's place.
Then you return to the village.

1989
02:07:47,983 --> 02:07:52,044
Yes, I should return to
the village. Well said.

1990
02:07:52,248 --> 02:07:56,455
If your father would
have come to know by now..

1991
02:07:56,578 --> 02:08:00,721
..that I've escorted you,
he will peel off my skin.

1992
02:08:00,802 --> 02:08:03,116
Then he will beat me black and blue.

1993
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:05,149
Then why did you stop me?

1994
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:08,617
You should have let me die.
Everything would have been fine.

1995
02:08:09,127 --> 02:08:10,513
I am unfortunate after all.

1996
02:08:10,667 --> 02:08:12,950
Look, you have started crying.

1997
02:08:13,035 --> 02:08:15,700
Silly, I didn't tell you anything.

1998
02:08:15,784 --> 02:08:19,863
Don't cry. I won't
leave you alone here.

1999
02:08:20,326 --> 02:08:22,515
But what should we do?

2000
02:08:23,701 --> 02:08:28,072
Radha, I had
completely forgotten it..

2001
02:08:28,153 --> 02:08:31,203
..that Moti is an advocate here
and he must be visiting the court.

2002
02:08:31,284 --> 02:08:33,292
He must know Shiv's address too.

2003
02:08:33,845 --> 02:08:37,395
Come on, let's reach the court
asking the way from the people.

2004
02:08:37,476 --> 02:08:38,742
Come on, hurry up. Come on.

2005
02:08:40,746 --> 02:08:44,980
Sir, at least I should get
this case, it will be best for me.

2006
02:08:45,061 --> 02:08:46,848
Please try your best. I
shall be very grateful to you.

2007
02:08:47,237 --> 02:08:50,416
I will try my best, Mr.
Moti. Don't worry. - Thank you.

2008
02:08:50,868 --> 02:08:52,441
What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

2009
02:08:55,553 --> 02:08:58,527
Moti.
- You and here?

2010
02:08:58,846 --> 02:09:01,780
Sukhiya is
exhausted while wandering.

2011
02:09:01,861 --> 02:09:04,925
I am not alone. She is with me too.

2012
02:09:05,402 --> 02:09:08,346
Radha? How did she come here?

2013
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,898
What else? In search of Shiv.

2014
02:09:11,349 --> 02:09:14,223
Shiv is here at Kolkata?
- Listen to him. - Hey?

2015
02:09:16,045 --> 02:09:19,783
Don't you know? He has
left the village one year ago.

2016
02:09:19,868 --> 02:09:22,199
He drives the taxi here nowadays.

2017
02:09:22,558 --> 02:09:24,777
One year has passed and
I haven't come to know.

2018
02:09:24,909 --> 02:09:29,279
Moti, you will have to find
out now. Radha has come here.

2019
02:09:31,317 --> 02:09:34,311
Radha, you have done a wrong thing.

2020
02:09:35,486 --> 02:09:37,116
Why did you come
here without informing?

2021
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:41,357
What else? Her father
fixed her wedding elsewhere.

2022
02:09:41,631 --> 02:09:44,867
What should I tell you, Moti?
She was about to commit suicide.

2023
02:09:45,140 --> 02:09:48,325
Thank God that I spotted her.

2024
02:09:48,554 --> 02:09:51,023
She said that whom she has
accepted as her husband..

2025
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:54,603
..before God once,
only he is her husband.

2026
02:09:54,684 --> 02:09:57,450
If she doesn't get him,
why will she survive?

2027
02:09:57,751 --> 02:09:59,489
I didn't know the address too.

2028
02:10:00,068 --> 02:10:03,265
But I thought I will
definitely find you in this court.

2029
02:10:05,037 --> 02:10:07,823
Forget whatever that
has happened. Come on.

2030
02:10:07,904 --> 02:10:12,845
But Moti, if you take
Radha to your in-law's place..

2031
02:10:12,926 --> 02:10:15,908
No, Sukhiya. That
question doesn't arise now.

2032
02:10:16,868 --> 02:10:20,439
I've left my
in-law's place. Come on.

2033
02:10:31,890 --> 02:10:35,831
Rekha! Rekha!

2034
02:10:37,701 --> 02:10:38,783
What's wrong, Daddy?

2035
02:10:39,056 --> 02:10:40,199
You are asking this to me?

2036
02:10:40,623 --> 02:10:42,950
Go and ask that
idiot who has cheated me.

2037
02:10:43,207 --> 02:10:44,773
He has played with
my daughter's life.

2038
02:10:45,035 --> 02:10:46,620
What are you saying?

2039
02:10:46,793 --> 02:10:49,598
Rekha, do you know that
idiot has a second wife?

2040
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:52,619
Daddy?
- Yes, he was already married.

2041
02:10:53,001 --> 02:10:54,948
And today his wife has
come here from the village.

2042
02:10:56,581 --> 02:10:59,340
No. It is impossible.

2043
02:10:59,855 --> 02:11:01,825
I knew that you won't believe me.

2044
02:11:02,490 --> 02:11:05,456
But I've heard and seen everything.

2045
02:11:06,116 --> 02:11:07,828
That girl's name is Radha.

2046
02:11:08,289 --> 02:11:10,866
If you still don't believe me then
call up Mr. Surendra and ask him.

2047
02:11:11,042 --> 02:11:12,477
He was also with me.

2048
02:11:13,057 --> 02:11:16,054
What are you looking at? Do
you think I'm deceiving you?

2049
02:11:16,952 --> 02:11:18,022
No, Daddy.

2050
02:11:19,554 --> 02:11:21,600
You can never
do such a cheap thing.

2051
02:11:24,323 --> 02:11:27,116
You would always say that
for a woman her husband..

2052
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:30,545
..is her God and his
house is her heaven.

2053
02:11:31,832 --> 02:11:36,575
I didn't see the heaven,
but is this the form of God?

2054
02:11:37,702 --> 02:11:40,203
Is this the result of
true love and trust?

2055
02:11:40,821 --> 02:11:45,223
Madam, Mr. Ashok has come.
-Shall I tell him to go?

2056
02:11:45,853 --> 02:11:47,002
No.

2057
02:11:48,939 --> 02:11:52,928
Tell him to sit. I'll
change my clothes and come.

2058
02:11:57,444 --> 02:11:59,870
Hello, Mr. Ashok.
- Hello, Rekha.

2059
02:12:00,515 --> 02:12:02,703
Have a seat. Be seated.

2060
02:12:03,124 --> 02:12:05,116
Really, Ms. Rekha, I
am extremely shocked..

2061
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:06,386
..to hear these things.

2062
02:12:07,078 --> 02:12:10,514
I couldn't even dream that the
man whom you loved so much..

2063
02:12:10,595 --> 02:12:15,541
Forget about him. You
talk about yourself.

2064
02:12:16,869 --> 02:12:18,370
Why don't you come here nowadays?

2065
02:12:18,963 --> 02:12:20,124
What should I tell you, Ms. Rekha?

2066
02:12:20,341 --> 02:12:23,366
I felt as if you don't
like my visits here.

2067
02:12:24,216 --> 02:12:28,516
Don't be silly. So
what will you have? Tea?

2068
02:12:28,904 --> 02:12:33,631
No need for it. If you don't mind,
let's go for a drive.

2069
02:12:34,549 --> 02:12:36,299
You will feel better and..

2070
02:12:37,034 --> 02:12:39,940
Do you think I'm upset?

2071
02:12:41,209 --> 02:12:42,465
Let's go wherever you wish.

2072
02:12:45,632 --> 02:12:46,715
Please come.

2073
02:12:53,924 --> 02:12:54,925
Please come.

2074
02:12:56,157 --> 02:12:58,733
This is my
dream house which I've brought.

2075
02:13:01,666 --> 02:13:06,146
It's very late. I think we will
come to see it some other day.

2076
02:13:06,227 --> 02:13:07,237
Let's go now.

2077
02:13:07,318 --> 02:13:10,049
What's the harm in seeing it
when you've come till here?

2078
02:13:10,841 --> 02:13:12,049
For the sake of my happiness.

2079
02:13:12,549 --> 02:13:15,548
Ms. Rekha, I think you are
still unable to forget..

2080
02:13:15,632 --> 02:13:17,631
..that rustic and uncultured man.

2081
02:13:19,216 --> 02:13:20,631
Let's go.
- Please come.

2082
02:13:34,412 --> 02:13:37,631
That day has arrived today
luckily for which I waited for long.

2083
02:13:37,966 --> 02:13:39,049
Please come.

2084
02:13:44,716 --> 02:13:47,868
Please be seated. Now, tell me,
what would you like to have?

2085
02:13:48,258 --> 02:13:51,855
Something cold or something hot?

2086
02:13:52,632 --> 02:13:55,424
Pardon? No, thank you.

2087
02:13:56,548 --> 02:13:58,631
I think we should leave now.

2088
02:13:59,423 --> 02:14:00,673
It's very late.

2089
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:02,576
Daddy will think.. - No.

2090
02:14:03,301 --> 02:14:07,340
Your daddy will be happy on
hearing that you've come with me.

2091
02:14:07,833 --> 02:14:11,257
Perhaps because he doesn't
know you well. - Pardon?

2092
02:14:11,883 --> 02:14:12,965
Let's go.

2093
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:15,840
No.
- Ashok?

2094
02:14:16,218 --> 02:14:18,070
I won't let you go in this way.

2095
02:14:18,467 --> 02:14:21,631
Your daddy has told me
to win your heart anyhow.

2096
02:14:22,549 --> 02:14:24,359
How did you even
think that you can win..

2097
02:14:25,147 --> 02:14:27,310
..a girl's heart in this manner?

2098
02:14:28,716 --> 02:14:29,798
Get aside.

2099
02:14:30,410 --> 02:14:31,551
No.

2100
02:14:32,155 --> 02:14:37,848
If I can't win your heart,
I'll make you helpless, weak.

2101
02:14:38,549 --> 02:14:41,798
You have often
insulted me in many ways.

2102
02:14:42,549 --> 02:14:46,466
I will shatter your pride today.
- Ashok!

2103
02:14:48,549 --> 02:14:51,299
Rekha! I love you, Rekha.

2104
02:14:53,216 --> 02:14:54,299
I love you.

2105
02:14:56,467 --> 02:14:58,424
I can't live without you, Rekha.
- Shut up!

2106
02:14:59,341 --> 02:15:02,382
Open the door or I will scream.

2107
02:15:02,549 --> 02:15:05,007
Shout. Shout to
your heart's content.

2108
02:15:05,684 --> 02:15:07,288
But it's of no use to shout.

2109
02:15:07,702 --> 02:15:10,382
No one will hear your
voice within these four walls.

2110
02:15:11,467 --> 02:15:13,466
No one will hear your
voice in this isolation.

2111
02:15:13,796 --> 02:15:15,870
So, you have proved to be
a beast after all. - Yes.

2112
02:15:18,383 --> 02:15:19,781
Please let me go.

2113
02:15:20,216 --> 02:15:21,299
Where will you go?

2114
02:15:25,258 --> 02:15:26,340
No!

2115
02:15:35,716 --> 02:15:36,798
Come on.

2116
02:15:41,050 --> 02:15:42,132
No!

2117
02:15:42,387 --> 02:15:44,399
So, you won't remove your clothes?

2118
02:15:46,821 --> 02:15:49,058
No! No!

2119
02:15:51,549 --> 02:15:53,094
No!

2120
02:15:53,632 --> 02:15:55,010
No!

2121
02:15:58,833 --> 02:16:00,267
Why have you come here?
- Idiot!

2122
02:16:01,549 --> 02:16:02,631
Shiv!

2123
02:16:03,982 --> 02:16:06,000
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!

2124
02:16:06,383 --> 02:16:07,466
Sister-in-law!

2125
02:16:07,645 --> 02:16:10,679
Sister-in-law, go down and sit
in the taxi. - No! No, Shiv.

2126
02:16:10,857 --> 02:16:12,340
I'll take revenge with this
decent man and be right back. - No.

2127
02:16:12,425 --> 02:16:13,548
What are you doing? Come on.

2128
02:16:13,632 --> 02:16:15,798
Go, Sister-in-law. Go.
- No, Shiv. Shiv.

2129
02:16:15,883 --> 02:16:16,965
Sister-in-law, go.

2130
02:16:17,549 --> 02:16:21,102
So, sir, we are rustic,

2131
02:16:21,445 --> 02:16:24,923
uncultured, but you are decent.

2132
02:16:25,972 --> 02:16:28,269
Is this the
example of your decency..

2133
02:16:28,670 --> 02:16:31,106
..to rape someone
else's daughter-in-law?

2134
02:16:32,467 --> 02:16:34,466
You dare to do this.

2135
02:16:58,209 --> 02:17:00,530
Take this.

2136
02:17:02,963 --> 02:17:04,168
Take this.

2137
02:17:04,924 --> 02:17:06,132
Get up.

2138
02:17:44,549 --> 02:17:45,807
Shiv, this..

2139
02:17:47,718 --> 02:17:48,757
Let it be.

2140
02:17:50,632 --> 02:17:53,784
Sister-in-law, is this the
custom of your society..

2141
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:57,711
..to leave your husband at
home and go out with an outsider?

2142
02:17:58,178 --> 02:18:01,631
Why not? After all what has
your brother done with me.

2143
02:18:02,683 --> 02:18:06,263
He kept it a secret from me
that he was already married.

2144
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:08,903
Sister-in-law, what are you saying?

2145
02:18:09,547 --> 02:18:12,529
I am telling the truth. His
wife has come from the village.

2146
02:18:13,056 --> 02:18:14,420
Her name is Radha.

2147
02:18:14,966 --> 02:18:17,631
Radha? Radha has come here?

2148
02:18:18,591 --> 02:18:19,715
Do you know her?

2149
02:18:20,291 --> 02:18:24,491
Sister-in-law, of course, I
know her. Radha is.. - Shiv!

2150
02:18:24,804 --> 02:18:27,565
Come on, let's go home. I'll
tell you everything. Come on.

2151
02:18:38,549 --> 02:18:40,970
Shiv, won't you come in?

2152
02:18:41,998 --> 02:18:43,254
No, Sister-in-law.

2153
02:18:43,954 --> 02:18:45,401
One day I had come to this house..

2154
02:18:45,948 --> 02:18:48,174
..considering it my brother
and sister-in-law's house.

2155
02:18:49,121 --> 02:18:52,630
But I had to leave
in tears from here.

2156
02:18:53,826 --> 02:18:55,563
Now I will never come to this house.

2157
02:18:56,191 --> 02:18:57,658
I'll never come, Sister-in-law.

2158
02:19:09,174 --> 02:19:12,843
Rekha, where are you going?

2159
02:19:13,661 --> 02:19:16,498
Where I am supposed to go.
- Don't be silly. Go upstairs.

2160
02:19:16,824 --> 02:19:17,942
What has happened all of a sudden..

2161
02:19:18,022 --> 02:19:19,385
..for which you are
leaving this house?

2162
02:19:19,870 --> 02:19:22,710
Daddy, I've come to my senses today.

2163
02:19:23,607 --> 02:19:28,773
I've seen your society,
culture and everything.

2164
02:19:29,398 --> 02:19:33,230
And my in-laws too.

2165
02:19:33,315 --> 02:19:34,690
Don't talk nonsense.

2166
02:19:34,983 --> 02:19:36,356
Do you want to go to that hell?

2167
02:19:36,523 --> 02:19:38,146
Do you want to go to that hell?

2168
02:19:38,379 --> 02:19:39,400
Yes, Daddy.

2169
02:19:39,566 --> 02:19:41,056
No. You can't go.

2170
02:19:41,440 --> 02:19:44,058
I have already decided.
- What?

2171
02:19:45,531 --> 02:19:47,948
All right. Then
hear my decision too.

2172
02:19:48,438 --> 02:19:51,706
If you will leave, these doors
will be shut for you forever.

2173
02:19:52,037 --> 02:19:54,252
You won't get a single
paisa from my wealth.

2174
02:19:55,681 --> 02:19:57,883
I am a daughter-in-law
of a farmer's family.

2175
02:19:58,766 --> 02:20:00,301
Why do I need your wealth?

2176
02:20:00,382 --> 02:20:03,036
Shut up! Get out!

2177
02:20:07,031 --> 02:20:08,231
Get out!

2178
02:20:08,312 --> 02:20:09,987
I say get out!

2179
02:20:17,515 --> 02:20:20,796
No! I'll think my daughter is dead.

2180
02:20:21,908 --> 02:20:25,398
Radha, look whom have I brought.

2181
02:20:27,011 --> 02:20:28,356
See who has come.

2182
02:20:38,067 --> 02:20:39,231
What has happened?

2183
02:20:39,858 --> 02:20:41,031
Nothing.

2184
02:20:41,984 --> 02:20:44,891
But why have
you come like this, Radha?

2185
02:20:45,535 --> 02:20:47,231
I had promised your father.

2186
02:20:47,722 --> 02:20:49,663
That's why he extended the
time limit to repay his loan.

2187
02:20:50,775 --> 02:20:52,273
I wonder what will happen now.

2188
02:20:52,799 --> 02:20:54,741
How your father will take
revenge with my brother?

2189
02:20:55,719 --> 02:20:57,273
I was unable to
control myself, Shiv.

2190
02:20:57,826 --> 02:21:01,150
I had gone to commit suicide.
Brother Sukhiya saved me.

2191
02:21:01,729 --> 02:21:03,397
Radha? - Yes.

2192
02:21:03,642 --> 02:21:07,084
You always
thought that I just threaten you.

2193
02:21:07,652 --> 02:21:10,064
I've accepted you as
my husband before God..

2194
02:21:10,783 --> 02:21:12,481
..that's why I have come to you.

2195
02:21:12,829 --> 02:21:15,687
If you don't want to give
me support then tell me..

2196
02:21:16,023 --> 02:21:21,584
..I'll go anywhere but
never become a burden on you.

2197
02:21:21,991 --> 02:21:23,147
Don't say this, Radha.

2198
02:21:23,738 --> 02:21:26,982
You don't know I was so hurt
while leaving you and coming here.

2199
02:21:27,695 --> 02:21:31,015
But what should I do? I had to do
it for the sake of brother's land.

2200
02:21:31,732 --> 02:21:33,534
I'm brother's step-brother.

2201
02:21:34,256 --> 02:21:36,064
But brother and
sister-in-law have brought me up..

2202
02:21:36,148 --> 02:21:37,693
..like their own child.

2203
02:21:38,065 --> 02:21:40,020
Today brother Moti is taking
all the pain for elder brother.

2204
02:21:40,101 --> 02:21:41,847
That's why I had to repent for it.

2205
02:21:42,289 --> 02:21:47,064
Shiv, is the land everything
to you? Am I of no importance?

2206
02:21:47,148 --> 02:21:48,231
What are you saying?

2207
02:21:48,786 --> 02:21:51,147
Don't you know what you are for me?

2208
02:21:51,529 --> 02:21:52,818
I am here at Kolkata since one year.

2209
02:21:53,092 --> 02:21:55,982
I swear, I didn't even
glance towards any girl.

2210
02:21:57,863 --> 02:21:59,471
Shiv!
- Radha!

2211
02:21:59,599 --> 02:22:00,659
Oh, Shiv!

2212
02:22:01,761 --> 02:22:03,949
Don't cry, Radha. Don't cry.

2213
02:22:05,951 --> 02:22:07,250
What's the matter, Sukhiya?

2214
02:22:09,276 --> 02:22:13,186
What else? Radha and
Kishan have reconciled.

2215
02:22:13,759 --> 02:22:16,147
Radha? Has Shiv come?
- Yes.

2216
02:22:16,748 --> 02:22:19,234
Where are you going?
I'm standing here.

2217
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:23,918
Shiv! Shiv! Shiv!
- Brother Moti!

2218
02:22:24,103 --> 02:22:26,965
Shiv! Shiv!
- Brother Moti! Brother Moti!

2219
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:30,093
Shiv, what has happened to you?

2220
02:22:30,843 --> 02:22:33,583
It's nothing. It's
just a minor injury. Yes.

2221
02:22:34,651 --> 02:22:36,414
Shiv. Shiv.

2222
02:22:37,622 --> 02:22:40,871
Shiv, what wrong have I done
that you are here in Kolkata..

2223
02:22:41,361 --> 02:22:44,208
..since one year and you
didn't come to meet me once?

2224
02:22:45,498 --> 02:22:48,399
Is your brother Moti so bad that
you don't want to see his face?

2225
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:52,452
No, Brother Moti, forgive me.
I had misunderstood you.

2226
02:22:53,335 --> 02:22:55,656
No one has understood me right.

2227
02:22:57,010 --> 02:22:59,401
I have become the victim of
all the misunderstandings.

2228
02:22:59,695 --> 02:23:00,804
No, Brother.

2229
02:23:01,523 --> 02:23:05,121
Shiv, I want to tell
you something today.

2230
02:23:06,415 --> 02:23:09,048
The land which brother has
mortgaged to educate me..

2231
02:23:09,502 --> 02:23:13,311
..I won't show him my
face till I get it released.

2232
02:23:14,325 --> 02:23:15,640
Though I may die.

2233
02:23:15,721 --> 02:23:17,735
It is not a great thing,
Brother Moti.

2234
02:23:17,816 --> 02:23:22,154
I also earn now. We both will save
money and get our land released.

2235
02:23:24,435 --> 02:23:26,510
But, brother Moti, Radha
has created a big problem.

2236
02:23:26,707 --> 02:23:27,788
She has come here all of a sudden..

2237
02:23:27,869 --> 02:23:29,721
..now I wonder how her
father will treat brother.

2238
02:23:29,970 --> 02:23:31,961
What will he do? He
can't do anything.

2239
02:23:32,692 --> 02:23:34,595
Radha has taken a good
decision to come here.

2240
02:23:35,663 --> 02:23:38,524
Shiv, you are so fortunate.

2241
02:23:39,807 --> 02:23:42,580
I wonder when she
accepted you before Lord.

2242
02:23:43,476 --> 02:23:47,664
And she left everything
considering that relationship true.

2243
02:23:48,942 --> 02:23:51,560
This illiterate, rustic,
innocent village girl..

2244
02:23:52,482 --> 02:23:54,227
..is incomparable to Rekha..
- No, Brother Moti..

2245
02:23:54,599 --> 02:23:56,147
..we have
misunderstood sister-in-law too.

2246
02:23:56,582 --> 02:23:58,137
Actually,
sister-in-law is very nice.

2247
02:23:59,074 --> 02:24:00,199
Did you meet Rekha?

2248
02:24:00,280 --> 02:24:04,746
Yes. I forgot to tell you.
She returned home in my taxi.

2249
02:24:05,041 --> 02:24:08,038
I'm telling you, Brother.
Please meet sister-in-law once.

2250
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:12,625
No, Shiv. I've left that
house after being insulted a lot.

2251
02:24:13,308 --> 02:24:15,432
Now, I will never go there again.

2252
02:24:16,068 --> 02:24:17,231
Oh, Sister-in-law!

2253
02:24:18,368 --> 02:24:21,620
Rekha, you and here?
- Yes.

2254
02:24:23,983 --> 02:24:25,443
Why have you come?

2255
02:24:26,801 --> 02:24:31,343
I've left everything
and come to you forever.

2256
02:24:33,705 --> 02:24:37,811
But what about your
wealth and your society?

2257
02:24:38,684 --> 02:24:41,609
Won't you find it difficult
to make such a big sacrifice?

2258
02:24:42,691 --> 02:24:46,765
Why? If you can
abandon your wife whom..

2259
02:24:47,148 --> 02:24:51,575
..you had accepted as your
wife with fire as the witness..

2260
02:24:52,649 --> 02:24:55,295
..can't I leave the
wealth and society?

2261
02:24:56,628 --> 02:24:57,694
Forget it.

2262
02:24:59,300 --> 02:25:03,254
Daddy has shut the
doors of his house for me forever.

2263
02:25:05,738 --> 02:25:09,731
Now tell me. Are the doors of
this house are shut for me too?

2264
02:25:10,225 --> 02:25:11,576
What are you saying?

2265
02:25:11,919 --> 02:25:14,295
Who can close the doors of
this house for you, Sister-in-law?

2266
02:25:14,376 --> 02:25:15,419
Who can dare to do this?

2267
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:17,797
If brother Moti
taunts you, I'll write..

2268
02:25:17,963 --> 02:25:19,732
..a letter to elder
brother right now.

2269
02:25:20,932 --> 02:25:23,769
Look at this. Why are you crying?

2270
02:25:24,371 --> 02:25:27,062
Radha, what are you
doing there? Come here.

2271
02:25:27,143 --> 02:25:28,234
Come quickly.

2272
02:25:29,482 --> 02:25:31,564
Look here. She is my sister-in-law.

2273
02:25:31,649 --> 02:25:34,932
Look how beautiful
she is. Isn't she?

2274
02:25:38,191 --> 02:25:39,273
Oh, Radha!

2275
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:42,898
It is a day to rejoice.

2276
02:25:42,983 --> 02:25:44,961
Brother Moti, why are you
sitting with a downtrodden face?

2277
02:25:45,042 --> 02:25:47,190
You do something too.
- What should I do? Keep quiet.

2278
02:25:47,271 --> 02:25:48,374
Why are you like this?

2279
02:25:48,455 --> 02:25:50,815
I wish I could fly and get
brother and sister-in-law back.

2280
02:25:50,899 --> 02:25:51,882
Right, Sukhiya?

2281
02:25:51,963 --> 02:25:54,121
No. Never. I will never go there.
- Why? Why?

2282
02:25:54,202 --> 02:25:56,846
Shiv, you sing that song.
Which song was it?

2283
02:25:56,927 --> 02:26:00,310
Oh, yes. "It's the night to
rejoice. Dance gracefully."

2284
02:26:03,358 --> 02:26:05,418
Master! Master!

2285
02:26:06,099 --> 02:26:07,232
Master!

2286
02:26:08,732 --> 02:26:09,815
What's wrong?

2287
02:26:10,263 --> 02:26:11,339
Sister-in-law?

2288
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:13,967
Master, come quickly. The
police have arrested brother Ganga.

2289
02:26:14,048 --> 02:26:15,405
Why? What's the matter?

2290
02:26:15,649 --> 02:26:16,731
I don't know, Master.

2291
02:26:16,816 --> 02:26:18,594
Brother Ganga is cutting
the harvest in his farm.

2292
02:26:18,834 --> 02:26:20,894
The police came and said
this farm belongs to Mr. Hari.

2293
02:26:21,233 --> 02:26:22,579
And they have taken brother Ganga..

2294
02:26:22,660 --> 02:26:23,865
..under the allegation
of stealing the harvest.

2295
02:26:24,069 --> 02:26:26,734
How is it possible?
Sister-in-law, that is your land.

2296
02:26:26,899 --> 02:26:29,076
Only we know it, Master.

2297
02:26:29,229 --> 02:26:32,654
But I've heard that Mr. Hari
has shown the court documents..

2298
02:26:32,735 --> 02:26:35,203
..to the police, so the
land belongs to him. - What?

2299
02:26:35,534 --> 02:26:40,345
Yes, Master. This plot of land
has become a curse for our family.

2300
02:26:41,191 --> 02:26:43,594
Both of my brother-in-laws
have gone away because of it..

2301
02:26:44,306 --> 02:26:46,690
..and today my husband
is going to the jail.

2302
02:26:47,691 --> 02:26:49,316
You take me to him.

2303
02:26:49,397 --> 02:26:53,801
I will fall at his feet and say he
should take this plot and spare us.

2304
02:26:54,565 --> 02:26:56,497
We will leave the village.

2305
02:26:57,482 --> 02:27:01,142
We will eat one time meal
but we don't want this plot.

2306
02:27:01,223 --> 02:27:05,562
No, Sister-in-law. Your plot of
land is not the entire country.

2307
02:27:06,083 --> 02:27:07,773
And there is not one
but many Mr. Hari.

2308
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:10,481
The landlords have gone
but many money lenders..

2309
02:27:10,565 --> 02:27:14,006
..have taken their
place like Mr. Hari.

2310
02:27:14,598 --> 02:27:17,200
And the same
atrocity is done today too.

2311
02:27:17,772 --> 02:27:20,384
This news can't reach
the law ..

2312
02:27:21,464 --> 02:27:24,192
..but the sufferers..

2313
02:27:24,405 --> 02:27:27,273
..are still weak and illiterates.

2314
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:30,185
And not one but many
people like brother Ganga..

2315
02:27:30,337 --> 02:27:34,315
..lose everything
and leave the village.

2316
02:27:35,565 --> 02:27:37,064
This won't happen now.

2317
02:27:38,009 --> 02:27:41,174
This has to be revolted.

2318
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:51,671
Shiv, who is Mr. Mahesh?

2319
02:27:52,061 --> 02:27:53,805
He is the master of our village.

2320
02:27:54,314 --> 02:27:56,265
But Sister-in-law, what's wrong?

2321
02:27:56,742 --> 02:27:58,143
Is any bad news
written in the letter?

2322
02:27:58,270 --> 02:28:00,265
Yes, Shiv. Listen.

2323
02:28:01,192 --> 02:28:03,412
Dear Shiv, as soon
you get this letter..

2324
02:28:03,493 --> 02:28:06,143
..come to Manupur
immediately with Mr. Moti.

2325
02:28:06,802 --> 02:28:09,887
Your family is
facing a grave problem.

2326
02:28:10,658 --> 02:28:12,909
On the basis of a false appeal,
Mr. Hari has taken..

2327
02:28:13,144 --> 02:28:15,352
..the rights of the
land from the court.

2328
02:28:15,963 --> 02:28:18,602
Brother Ganga is in
police custody today.

2329
02:28:18,891 --> 02:28:21,978
I tried my best but I
couldn't get his bail granted.

2330
02:28:22,682 --> 02:28:26,223
Mr. Hari has done
all this cautiously.

2331
02:28:26,816 --> 02:28:29,751
Shiv, the biggest
thing to grieve is..

2332
02:28:32,330 --> 02:28:35,143
I already knew that it will happen.

2333
02:28:36,392 --> 02:28:37,894
All this is
happening because of her.

2334
02:28:38,272 --> 02:28:41,833
I'm having many problems since
my name is linked with my family.

2335
02:28:41,914 --> 02:28:43,957
She left her house and
came here. Unlucky girl!

2336
02:28:44,174 --> 02:28:45,804
Your work is ruined
if you see her face.

2337
02:28:45,885 --> 02:28:46,967
I feel like strangling her throat.

2338
02:28:47,051 --> 02:28:48,967
Shiv, come to your senses.
What are you doing?

2339
02:28:49,139 --> 02:28:52,341
Go. Go bring your
brother immediately. Go.

2340
02:29:06,568 --> 02:29:11,925
"The drape explains to
you to hold my hand."

2341
02:29:12,116 --> 02:29:17,142
"The drape explains to
you to hold my hand."

2342
02:29:17,426 --> 02:29:22,092
"The kohl explains
to you to embrace me."

2343
02:29:22,177 --> 02:29:27,387
"I'm fed up of explaining all this."

2344
02:29:27,801 --> 02:29:33,033
"He is so foolish, he
doesn't understand love."

2345
02:29:33,426 --> 02:29:38,470
"Go and cry there."

2346
02:29:38,551 --> 02:29:43,588
"Dark clouds go to
my beloved's door."

2347
02:29:43,885 --> 02:29:48,810
"He is so foolish, he
doesn't understand love."

2348
02:29:49,177 --> 02:29:54,550
"He is so foolish, he
doesn't understand love."

2349
02:29:55,010 --> 02:29:56,092
Rekha!

2350
02:29:58,259 --> 02:29:59,341
Radha!

2351
02:30:01,259 --> 02:30:02,383
Rekha?

2352
02:30:04,468 --> 02:30:06,675
Where have everyone gone
leaving the doors open?

2353
02:30:08,259 --> 02:30:09,341
Rekha?

2354
02:30:13,259 --> 02:30:15,985
Where had you all gone?
- I had gone to bring this letter.

2355
02:30:16,259 --> 02:30:17,425
And where is Radha?

2356
02:30:17,763 --> 02:30:19,802
Radha? She is at home.

2357
02:30:19,883 --> 02:30:21,092
She is not at home.

2358
02:30:21,342 --> 02:30:22,800
Where has she gone if
she is not present at home?

2359
02:30:25,342 --> 02:30:26,423
What if out of sorrow..

2360
02:30:26,634 --> 02:30:27,836
Out of sorrow?

2361
02:30:28,497 --> 02:30:31,723
Yes. Shiv had
abused her in a fit of anger.

2362
02:30:31,963 --> 02:30:32,962
What did he say?

2363
02:30:34,676 --> 02:30:35,759
What did you tell her?

2364
02:30:37,106 --> 02:30:40,999
Nothing, Brother. I got angry
on hearing the letter. And I..

2365
02:30:41,259 --> 02:30:44,845
But I didn't..
- Shut up! Stupid! Fool! Rustic boy!

2366
02:30:44,926 --> 02:30:46,540
You have grown up but
you are still childish.

2367
02:30:46,843 --> 02:30:48,145
I feel like giving you a tight slap.

2368
02:30:48,750 --> 02:30:50,232
I wonder where she must have gone.

2369
02:30:50,551 --> 02:30:52,009
I don't see Sukhiya around too.

2370
02:30:52,801 --> 02:30:55,040
What are you waiting for?
Go bring your taxi.

2371
02:30:55,121 --> 02:30:56,334
Find both of them.

2372
02:31:02,310 --> 02:31:04,425
Is it the same letter?
- Yes.

2373
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:23,047
Have you read it?
- Yes.

2374
02:31:25,823 --> 02:31:30,731
I never dreamt that
daddy will do this with us.

2375
02:31:31,864 --> 02:31:35,383
Why are you panicking?
We will have to face it.

2376
02:31:46,758 --> 02:31:49,981
Repeat with me. I will
tell only the truth.

2377
02:31:50,133 --> 02:31:51,757
I will tell only the truth.

2378
02:31:51,842 --> 02:31:55,590
Nothing except the truth.
- Nothing except the truth.

2379
02:31:55,943 --> 02:31:58,340
Is it true, Mr. Hari, that
you wanted to marry off..

2380
02:31:58,424 --> 02:32:00,924
..your daughter to
Gangaram's younger brother?

2381
02:32:01,008 --> 02:32:02,171
Yes.

2382
02:32:02,675 --> 02:32:05,213
What did you want to give as dowry?

2383
02:32:05,336 --> 02:32:10,225
I had said that I'll let go the
debt and give the land for free.

2384
02:32:10,541 --> 02:32:12,087
Gangaram, is it true?

2385
02:32:12,674 --> 02:32:14,206
He had promised something like this.

2386
02:32:14,758 --> 02:32:16,007
Then why didn't this
wedding take place?

2387
02:32:16,273 --> 02:32:18,966
Because Gangaram's younger
brother was already married, sir.

2388
02:32:19,098 --> 02:32:21,507
Oh, I see. Point to
be noted, Your Honour.

2389
02:32:22,693 --> 02:32:24,951
Gangaram, is it true that
you went to fix the proposal..

2390
02:32:25,032 --> 02:32:29,349
..your already married
brother with Mr. Hari's daughter?

2391
02:32:29,430 --> 02:32:32,729
Sir, I didn't know that
Moti is already married.

2392
02:32:34,568 --> 02:32:37,269
Mr. Hari, when did you
come to know about it?

2393
02:32:37,508 --> 02:32:40,814
When I arranged a feast for
the village out of happiness..

2394
02:32:41,028 --> 02:32:46,358
..there I announced that my
Radha's wedding is fixed with Moti.

2395
02:32:46,678 --> 02:32:47,841
After that.

2396
02:32:47,922 --> 02:32:50,837
Was Moti also present in
that feast along with Gangaram?

2397
02:32:51,175 --> 02:32:52,258
Yes.

2398
02:32:53,341 --> 02:32:56,340
Gangaram, let's believe
that you didn't know..

2399
02:32:56,424 --> 02:32:58,507
..that Mr. Moti is already married.

2400
02:32:59,089 --> 02:33:01,549
But had Mr. Moti also forgotten
that he is already married?

2401
02:33:02,186 --> 02:33:03,465
Order. Order.

2402
02:33:03,883 --> 02:33:06,846
Tell me, Gangaram. Why
are you silent? Tell me.

2403
02:33:07,092 --> 02:33:10,423
What should I say,
Advocate? You think.

2404
02:33:10,883 --> 02:33:12,503
Why don't you go and ask him?

2405
02:33:13,174 --> 02:33:17,286
Well, Mr. Hari, who told you
that Moti is already married?

2406
02:33:17,508 --> 02:33:21,068
Advocate, then Gangaram visited
our house after two-three days.

2407
02:33:21,259 --> 02:33:23,688
He said that Moti is already
married, so you marry off your..

2408
02:33:23,929 --> 02:33:27,339
..daughter to my
younger brother Shivram.

2409
02:33:27,508 --> 02:33:29,258
Then what did you say?
- I refused.

2410
02:33:29,589 --> 02:33:30,507
Why did you have an objection?

2411
02:33:30,591 --> 02:33:32,340
Advocate, it is not
a matter to object..

2412
02:33:32,424 --> 02:33:33,674
..it was a question of my respect.

2413
02:33:33,758 --> 02:33:36,326
I would have agreed
but Shivram's marriage..

2414
02:33:36,407 --> 02:33:39,548
..was already fixed with my
friend Sunderlal's daughter.

2415
02:33:42,627 --> 02:33:44,955
Gangaram, is it true?

2416
02:33:45,596 --> 02:33:49,507
Sir, it is true. But actually..

2417
02:33:49,591 --> 02:33:51,389
I don't want to know anything.

2418
02:33:51,470 --> 02:33:54,125
Just answer in yes
or no to my question.

2419
02:33:55,175 --> 02:33:56,258
Yes.

2420
02:33:58,925 --> 02:34:04,647
Your Honour, you know our
villages and society very well.

2421
02:34:05,217 --> 02:34:08,340
Today also if some
girl's proposal breaks..

2422
02:34:08,424 --> 02:34:12,340
..after being fixed once, it has
a great effect on her parents.

2423
02:34:12,424 --> 02:34:13,841
They are defamed.

2424
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:17,110
Your Honour, in spite
of knowing everything..

2425
02:34:17,191 --> 02:34:20,340
..this miscreant has
dishonoured two decent men..

2426
02:34:20,424 --> 02:34:23,384
..in the greed of
wealth and property.

2427
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:26,590
That's all, Your Honour.

2428
02:34:30,219 --> 02:34:33,234
Mr. Hari, which is the
plot that you were going to..

2429
02:34:33,677 --> 02:34:36,423
..give to Gangaram in
your daughter's dowry?

2430
02:34:36,784 --> 02:34:39,549
And which is that debt
that you were going to let go?

2431
02:34:40,124 --> 02:34:45,343
Why? My ancestral land which I
had lent to Gangaram to plough.

2432
02:34:45,653 --> 02:34:47,258
And that compensation amount which..

2433
02:34:47,339 --> 02:34:48,757
..Gangaram had not
paid me for last 30 years.

2434
02:34:48,842 --> 02:34:50,492
You are lying!
- Am I lying?

2435
02:34:50,573 --> 02:34:52,924
That land didn't belong to
your ancestors but Gangaram.

2436
02:34:53,336 --> 02:34:55,327
And that loan is not
the tax for tilling..

2437
02:34:55,408 --> 02:34:57,485
..but the money borrowed
by mortgaging that land.

2438
02:34:57,566 --> 02:34:59,340
Objection, Your Honour.
It is not a question..

2439
02:34:59,424 --> 02:35:01,698
..but an allegation on the witness.

2440
02:35:03,259 --> 02:35:04,475
I don't want to say
anything else, Your Honour.

2441
02:35:04,608 --> 02:35:07,996
I know, Your Honour, he
doesn't have any question..

2442
02:35:08,077 --> 02:35:10,844
..which reply may prove
that Gangaram is guiltless.

2443
02:35:11,668 --> 02:35:14,799
Just by shouting that it's a lie,
the lie can't be proved as truth.

2444
02:35:15,699 --> 02:35:17,647
The young advocate
should know that..

2445
02:35:17,882 --> 02:35:19,507
..it is not a farm but a court.

2446
02:35:19,897 --> 02:35:22,019
It is not the same
to plough and defence.

2447
02:35:22,827 --> 02:35:26,026
Your Honour, I've already
proved the allegations..

2448
02:35:26,107 --> 02:35:28,076
..of robbery and
defamation against Gangaram.

2449
02:35:28,585 --> 02:35:32,980
Now, I want to prove that
Gangaram's cousin brother..

2450
02:35:33,225 --> 02:35:36,281
..had placated Mr. Hari's
daughter to elope with him.

2451
02:35:36,820 --> 02:35:39,028
I have a proof that
the girl was reached..

2452
02:35:39,109 --> 02:35:42,317
..to Gangaram's brothers in Kolkata.

2453
02:35:43,475 --> 02:35:45,754
Your Honour, it is
possible that Radha was abducted..

2454
02:35:45,917 --> 02:35:47,423
..to take a revenge with Mr. Hari.

2455
02:35:47,857 --> 02:35:49,449
It is possible that
her life is in danger.

2456
02:35:49,654 --> 02:35:52,340
To know where she is
and in which condition..

2457
02:35:52,424 --> 02:35:55,886
..I'd like to call Gangaram's
younger brother Shivram to the court.

2458
02:35:56,111 --> 02:35:59,984
Your Honour, before
Shivram is called here..

2459
02:36:00,681 --> 02:36:02,361
..I want to say
something to the court.

2460
02:36:03,998 --> 02:36:09,141
I think, Your Honour, this
case is purposely made..

2461
02:36:09,944 --> 02:36:11,465
..to devastate Gangaram's family.

2462
02:36:12,987 --> 02:36:16,674
So, I request the court
to give me some time..

2463
02:36:17,954 --> 02:36:20,632
..so that I can save this
unfortunate farmer from the trouble.

2464
02:36:20,842 --> 02:36:21,799
But Your Honour,
how is it possible..

2465
02:36:21,883 --> 02:36:24,349
By accepting Mr. Moti's appeal..

2466
02:36:24,670 --> 02:36:28,007
..this case is postponed
to the 27th of this month.

2467
02:36:31,646 --> 02:36:33,803
Sister-in-law, why are you worried?

2468
02:36:34,490 --> 02:36:37,205
Why are you worrying
when brother Moti is here?

2469
02:36:37,689 --> 02:36:38,886
Sit.

2470
02:36:44,162 --> 02:36:45,486
Mr. Mahendranath,

2471
02:36:45,990 --> 02:36:51,444
keeping Mr.Moti's absence in mind the
court gives you permission to proceed.

2472
02:36:51,525 --> 02:36:52,681
Thank you, Your Honour.

2473
02:36:53,635 --> 02:36:56,893
I knew, Your Honour,
that young advocate..

2474
02:36:57,057 --> 02:36:58,899
..won't arrive at the
court on time out of shame.

2475
02:36:59,383 --> 02:37:02,166
Because he is a member
of Gangaram's family too.

2476
02:37:03,201 --> 02:37:05,785
And, Your Honour,
Gangaram's reality..

2477
02:37:05,866 --> 02:37:07,709
..has already been
revealed to the court.

2478
02:37:08,209 --> 02:37:09,765
Now I'd like to call
Gangaram's younger brother..

2479
02:37:09,846 --> 02:37:12,685
..Shivram at that witness box.

2480
02:37:13,084 --> 02:37:14,208
Permission granted.

2481
02:37:24,725 --> 02:37:26,166
Repeat with me.

2482
02:37:26,251 --> 02:37:28,359
I will speak only the truth.

2483
02:37:29,294 --> 02:37:30,826
I will speak only the truth.

2484
02:37:30,907 --> 02:37:34,903
Nothing except the truth.
- Nothing except the truth.

2485
02:37:36,726 --> 02:37:38,354
Isn't it true, Shivram,

2486
02:37:38,580 --> 02:37:41,780
that Mr.Hari's daughter
Radha was with you in Kolkata?

2487
02:37:43,002 --> 02:37:44,166
Yes, she was.

2488
02:37:44,710 --> 02:37:46,625
How did Radha reach Kolkata?

2489
02:37:48,020 --> 02:37:51,395
She had come there with
my cousin brother Sukhiya.

2490
02:37:51,588 --> 02:37:54,224
Shut up! She had not
come but she was..

2491
02:37:54,305 --> 02:37:55,979
..brought there
forcefully on your encouragement.

2492
02:37:56,060 --> 02:37:57,970
No, sir. Why will I do this?

2493
02:37:58,167 --> 02:38:00,391
So that you can exact revenge
of your enmity with Mr. Hari.

2494
02:38:00,922 --> 02:38:02,986
I also have a proof,
Shivram, that you thrashed..

2495
02:38:03,067 --> 02:38:06,083
..and committed atrocities
against Radha in Kolkata.

2496
02:38:06,167 --> 02:38:08,292
No, sir. One day in a fit of anger..

2497
02:38:08,376 --> 02:38:12,500
Your Honour, both of my
brothers will ruin me.

2498
02:38:12,776 --> 02:38:14,166
Order! Order!

2499
02:38:14,751 --> 02:38:15,834
Where is Radha now?

2500
02:38:17,454 --> 02:38:18,500
She got upset and went somewhere.

2501
02:38:18,585 --> 02:38:19,834
You are lying again.

2502
02:38:20,255 --> 02:38:21,717
You know where Radha is.

2503
02:38:22,002 --> 02:38:24,083
You all have hid her so
that you can pressurise..

2504
02:38:24,167 --> 02:38:26,125
..Mr. Hari and
derive money from him.

2505
02:38:28,233 --> 02:38:29,292
Now, tell me where is Radha.

2506
02:38:30,334 --> 02:38:33,375
Shivram, you will have to tell
in the court where Radha is.

2507
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:36,001
Where is Radha?

2508
02:38:36,082 --> 02:38:37,750
Radha is here, Your Honour.

2509
02:38:39,643 --> 02:38:41,779
Move aside.
- Order! Order! Order!

2510
02:38:42,201 --> 02:38:44,272
Order! Order! Order!
- Wretched Hari, what have you done?

2511
02:38:44,353 --> 02:38:46,372
Your Honour, this old lady
is disturbing the court.

2512
02:38:46,573 --> 02:38:48,141
What? Who is this idiot?

2513
02:38:48,222 --> 02:38:50,538
He is Moti's father-in-law, Grandma.

2514
02:38:50,619 --> 02:38:53,178
I see. So, both the
father-in-laws want to..

2515
02:38:53,259 --> 02:38:55,792
..ruin the lives of
both the son-in-laws.

2516
02:38:55,981 --> 02:38:58,274
Old lady, don't interfere
the investigation of the court.

2517
02:38:58,493 --> 02:38:59,477
Sit quietly.

2518
02:38:59,558 --> 02:39:02,169
Your Honour, I'll sit if you say.

2519
02:39:02,250 --> 02:39:05,271
But don't spare him.
Get aside, idiot.

2520
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:06,750
Order! Order!

2521
02:39:08,293 --> 02:39:09,417
Yes, Mr. Moti.

2522
02:39:09,639 --> 02:39:13,166
Your Honour, she is Mr.
Hari's daughter Radha.

2523
02:39:13,503 --> 02:39:15,792
The reply of all the
questions of this case.

2524
02:39:16,809 --> 02:39:18,915
I'd like to appeal the court
to give me permission to bring..

2525
02:39:18,996 --> 02:39:22,475
..Radha to the witness
box to reveal the truth.

2526
02:39:22,659 --> 02:39:23,955
Permission granted.

2527
02:39:24,036 --> 02:39:25,166
Please come.

2528
02:39:37,433 --> 02:39:38,712
Repeat with me.

2529
02:39:38,951 --> 02:39:43,116
I will speak only the truth.
- I will speak only the truth.

2530
02:39:43,197 --> 02:39:47,337
Nothing except the truth.
- Nothing except the truth.

2531
02:39:47,558 --> 02:39:49,110
Why? Are you jealous?

2532
02:39:50,970 --> 02:39:53,083
Radha, did you go to
Kolkata willingly..

2533
02:39:53,167 --> 02:39:55,548
..or did anyone take
you there forcefully?

2534
02:39:56,251 --> 02:39:58,458
I had gone there willingly.
- Why?

2535
02:39:59,849 --> 02:40:02,533
My father wanted to
marry me off to an old man..

2536
02:40:02,614 --> 02:40:04,292
..in the greed of money.

2537
02:40:04,946 --> 02:40:08,905
I had gone to commit suicide
but brother Sukhiya saved me.

2538
02:40:09,805 --> 02:40:12,306
And I went to Kolkata with him.

2539
02:40:12,521 --> 02:40:17,375
Okay, Radha, do you know
anything about this land?

2540
02:40:18,070 --> 02:40:21,787
Yes, Milord. This land
belongs to brother Ganga.

2541
02:40:22,266 --> 02:40:25,286
He mortgaged it to my
father and borrowed a loan.

2542
02:40:26,130 --> 02:40:29,953
Once I had given Rs.10,000
to Shiv to free this land.

2543
02:40:30,685 --> 02:40:33,654
That was my money, Milord.
My grandmother had given me.

2544
02:40:33,858 --> 02:40:35,574
Yes, Milord. I had given it to her.

2545
02:40:35,655 --> 02:40:37,166
It is a lie, Your Honour.

2546
02:40:37,293 --> 02:40:39,869
This girl is lying. She
is forced to tell lies.

2547
02:40:40,084 --> 02:40:43,184
Mr. Mahendranath, the
court will decide whether..

2548
02:40:43,627 --> 02:40:45,959
..the witness is telling
lies or truth and not you.

2549
02:40:46,461 --> 02:40:47,834
Proceed, Mr. Moti.

2550
02:40:48,614 --> 02:40:49,659
Thank you, Your Honour.

2551
02:40:51,167 --> 02:40:53,518
Radha, do you have
any other evidence..

2552
02:40:53,599 --> 02:40:56,625
..which may prove that
this land belongs to Gangaram?

2553
02:40:57,719 --> 02:40:58,875
Yes.
- What is it?

2554
02:41:09,084 --> 02:41:10,250
Take it.

2555
02:41:13,628 --> 02:41:14,753
What is this?

2556
02:41:16,339 --> 02:41:19,275
The real documents
of Gangaram's land.

2557
02:41:19,356 --> 02:41:21,737
No! It's a lie. The
real document is..

2558
02:41:21,818 --> 02:41:24,123
Why did you stop,
Mr. Hari? Answer me.

2559
02:41:24,246 --> 02:41:25,500
Where is the real document?

2560
02:41:26,389 --> 02:41:27,571
Your Honour, he can't tell.

2561
02:41:28,084 --> 02:41:30,837
Because he has burned and
destroyed the real document.

2562
02:41:31,004 --> 02:41:32,166
Then what is this?

2563
02:41:33,251 --> 02:41:34,320
Plain papers, sir.

2564
02:41:34,956 --> 02:41:36,166
Plain papers?

2565
02:41:36,459 --> 02:41:40,692
Yes, Your Honour. Like the
truth can't be proved a lie..

2566
02:41:40,773 --> 02:41:45,242
..by shouting it is a lie, the
truth can't be changed by shouting.

2567
02:41:46,084 --> 02:41:49,375
The truth is revealed in
this way, Your Honour.

2568
02:41:50,278 --> 02:41:52,208
Any objection, Mr. Mahendranath?

2569
02:41:56,722 --> 02:41:58,166
No objection, Your Honour.

2570
02:41:58,763 --> 02:42:00,250
Proceed, Mr. Moti.

2571
02:42:00,957 --> 02:42:01,991
Your Honour,

2572
02:42:03,201 --> 02:42:06,458
this is the reality of
respectable and cultured Mr. Hari.

2573
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:11,083
Respectable
advocate has dishonoured..

2574
02:42:11,167 --> 02:42:12,917
..Gangaram and his family.

2575
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:14,938
I don't want to repeat all that.

2576
02:42:15,335 --> 02:42:17,083
But he had said in this very court..

2577
02:42:17,167 --> 02:42:20,072
..that it is not the
same to plough and defence.

2578
02:42:20,378 --> 02:42:23,083
Perhaps he had forgotten
that he gets two times meal..

2579
02:42:23,167 --> 02:42:24,921
..only when the land is ploughed.

2580
02:42:26,543 --> 02:42:29,029
The farmer family
he has dishonoured..

2581
02:42:29,477 --> 02:42:32,500
..today..  one boy of that
family has become an advocate.

2582
02:42:32,585 --> 02:42:34,356
I request my respectable advocate..

2583
02:42:34,437 --> 02:42:36,333
..to plough the field once.

2584
02:42:38,167 --> 02:42:39,292
That's all, Your Honour.

2585
02:42:42,256 --> 02:42:45,423
Gangaram, the court
considers you innocent..

2586
02:42:45,653 --> 02:42:47,105
..and releases you with respect.

2587
02:42:50,914 --> 02:42:52,166
Sister-in-law!

2588
02:42:52,853 --> 02:42:55,083
We have won. We have won,
Sister-in-law. - Really?

2589
02:42:55,167 --> 02:42:56,985
We have won the case.
Brother Moti is here.

2590
02:42:58,171 --> 02:43:02,166
Daddy, you are my guru too.

2591
02:43:03,585 --> 02:43:05,834
Forgive me for my mistake.

2592
02:43:06,727 --> 02:43:10,166
Mahendra has never
lost any case. Today too..

2593
02:43:10,967 --> 02:43:15,358
It was my ambition. It was
the biggest dream of life.

2594
02:43:18,087 --> 02:43:19,250
Congratulations.

2595
02:43:32,534 --> 02:43:33,750
Radha.

2596
02:43:39,084 --> 02:43:41,166
Radha, please forgive me.
- Shiv!

2597
02:43:41,293 --> 02:43:43,701
Good grief! Your brother-in-law
and sister-in-law are standing here..

2598
02:43:43,782 --> 02:43:46,416
..and you are romancing before
them? Come on, cover this drape.

2599
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:51,677
Hari, you have committed many sins..

2600
02:43:52,065 --> 02:43:55,053
..that's why you are unable to
participate in this happy occasion.

2601
02:43:55,376 --> 02:43:56,907
Now give up your
greed and selfishness..

2602
02:43:56,988 --> 02:43:59,917
..and come to Kashi with me. Got it?

2603
02:44:00,084 --> 02:44:01,608
We will spend the
rest of our lives..

2604
02:44:01,689 --> 02:44:03,584
..at Lord Vishwanath's temple there.

2605
02:44:03,894 --> 02:44:05,378
I seek your
permission to go, Brother.

2606
02:44:06,084 --> 02:44:09,355
Moti, give whatever
punishment you like..

2607
02:44:09,436 --> 02:44:11,166
..to your illiterate
and rustic brother.

2608
02:44:11,668 --> 02:44:13,750
But please don't leave me.

2609
02:44:13,835 --> 02:44:16,918
No, Brother. I will never leave you.

2610
02:44:17,876 --> 02:44:20,208
I will never leave you, Brother.

2611
02:44:22,113 --> 02:44:23,292
Gangaram.

2612
02:44:29,012 --> 02:44:31,581
I had gone blind in the
greed of wealth and money.

2613
02:44:32,209 --> 02:44:34,166
I have made you suffer a lot.

2614
02:44:34,635 --> 02:44:36,805
Now, forgive me
before I go otherwise..

2615
02:44:37,167 --> 02:44:40,556
..my soul will never get peace,
Gangaram. I will never get peace.

2616
02:44:40,637 --> 02:44:44,256
Don't say this, Mr. Hari.
This village belongs to you.

2617
02:44:44,588 --> 02:44:46,250
It is your village.

2618
02:44:46,334 --> 02:44:49,709
No, Gangaram. The
times have changed.

2619
02:44:50,209 --> 02:44:51,997
The village belongs to the farmers.

2620
02:44:52,334 --> 02:44:55,792
The village doesn't
need Mr. Hari but master.

2621
02:44:57,274 --> 02:45:00,208
Take, Gangaram. Take it.

2622
02:45:01,379 --> 02:45:04,500
The documents of the other
farmers are kept in the locker.

2623
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:07,834
Please return them.
Let's go, Mother.

2624
02:45:12,167 --> 02:45:15,333
"It is the bond of love."

2625
02:45:15,418 --> 02:45:21,208
"We are bound in a
relationship stealthily."

2626
02:45:21,626 --> 02:45:27,730
"Where will you go?
Where will you go, beloved?"
