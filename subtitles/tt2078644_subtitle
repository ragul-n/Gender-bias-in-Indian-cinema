Prakash! Go and call him
You have come forthat, right?

29

He will sleep till mid-noon

They asked if it is real estate

l know it! Who will be that?

37
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,222
- Should l call them here?
- Move

38
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,269
Don't forget the commission
for me if it clicks!

39
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,871
Go and wash your mouth if you don't mind

40
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,467
lt stinks yesterday's left over

41
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,545

00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:10,997
l think so! Why?

45
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,834
Rainikka, Joyettan and party is there
lt is going on there

46
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,701
lf they didn't get anything
it will get nowhere

47
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,210
You know well about Rainikka!

48
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,305
We have suffered much for that business
You know well

49
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,178
What is difficult about it?

50
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:29,118
lt is just to show the place

51
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,782
We survive with the meager money like this

52
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,358
Get us some money from them

53
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,718
Damn it! ln the morning...!

00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,494
l'll call and tell Rainikka
You can go

55
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,087
lt won't work out without you

56
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,393
What is this nuisance?

57
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,492
You can go
l'll come there

58
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,774
Why do you invite
these slimy guys in the house?

59
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,040
l don't invite them
They get in themselves

60
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,740
Why do you create
an opportunity for it?

61
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:57,907
My dear mom!

62
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:02,420
l wish if Paris Aboobaker,
Alukas Joyettan

63
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,820
Malbar Gold Amudan and Ravi Pillai sir come

64
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,620
What to do?
They don't know me

65
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,104
- Have you seen Rainikka?
- That will not be right if we see

66
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,342
Move aside

67
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,107
Where is the Erinji bridge?
Over there!

68
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,511
The rate has gone up now!

69
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,548
That will not be right if we see

70
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,517
- Rainikka! One minute
- Tell me

71
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,814
We have to give those guys something!

72
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,219
- Which guys?
- Those standing there

73
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,384
Who are they?

74
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,930
They only told us about selling this site

75
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,933
Aren't you and him told us
about selling this site

76
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,534
lt was them who told us

77
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:55,265
Please come
You don't know about the world yet

78
00:07:55,675 --> 00:08:01,841
Many people will be there like that
How can l give money to all those?

79
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,643
Rainikka! What's the problem?

80
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,239
They both are doing business!

81
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,841
...and they have 2 assistants for them

82
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:10,389
They too want commission!
lt is really a problem!

83
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,586
You have to give those from
whatever you, and Hameed get

84
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,492
Don't come to us again
with worthless cases like these

85
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,859
Come Rainikka

86
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,736
Don't feed others when you
can't feed your self! You too

87
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,233
Come to the bridge tomorrow

88
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,173
lf he gives us anything,
we'll give these from that

89
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,438
- You can go now
- See you then

90
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,909
How long we'll go
behind Rainikka and Joyettan?

91
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:42,715
We can manage the brokers but the
nasty guys like this are unmanageable

92
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:47,754
lf anyone asks tell we are the brokers...
just like them

93
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,523
You know how much they earn in a day?

94
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,223
- How much?
- 15 millions

95
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,098
We have to play a game like them
right away no other go

96
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,135
God! He is here!

97
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,613
- Vasu uncle
- Prakash!

98
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,517
You didn't try that way
when l told you something

99
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,022
- What is it uncle?
- So you don't know

100
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,725
lt is long since l told you
to get a groom for Beena

101
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,695
She refuses by telling various reasons

102
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,093
l have not forgotten
l am looking into it

103
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,327
When l say the girl is a doctor
it doesn't click

104
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,960
The boy should be at least
a doctor, isn't it?

105
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,972
lt is not like that
The groom can be a business man

106
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,508
The business man only have plenty of money

107
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,107
You too are a land dealer

108
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,740
Tell him, we will give commission for him
He will have interest only then!

109
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,283
He is not a stranger

110
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,113
His mother will be
more or like my sister

111
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,189
Will he get it from me
if l give him any money?

112
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,849
He will get it from you full heartedly!

113
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,526
lt is his profession

114
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,824
We will get a guy for her

115
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,127
There are a few smart guys
who are in the real estate whom l know

116
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,498
ln that, one guy is keen
on making me a millionaire very soon

117
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,232
A millionaire very soon?
How is that possible?

118
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,308
lt is the specialty of this field, uncle

119
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,740
-At the wink of the eyes...
- Will become beggars!

120
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,475
Mom was searching you!
Stop your big talk and go to her

121
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,782
Ok! Then l'll go and see aunty...

122
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,381
You want to give me commission
if l find a boy for you!

123
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,582
What should l tell him, then?

124
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,488
Should l keep quiet when it is my

125
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,651
...groom and a millionaire too
who has earned from

126
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,490
...real estate business
and the marriage is not going to happen?

127
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,722
Won't it happen?

128
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,558
There is something to happen now
Do you want to see it?

129
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,568
What is it?

130
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,403
Your affair with her was
done by hiding so far!

131
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,170
Now you have brought it into the house!

132
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,837
l was just poking into this house
when l was going through this way

133
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,709
You mean through the main hall way?

134
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,985
Don't make me play
the role of the elder brother, right?

135
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,255
You were the only man
who was supporting me all the time

136
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,519
- You too have changed the party?
- She has two brothers other than me

137
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,685
One is a doctor and the
other is a engineer!

138
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:03,925
You're not any one of these two

139
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,554
You are the only rice merchant
in the market place!

140
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,567
You support when a real estate broker coming
as a brother in law, isn't it Surendretta?

141
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,701
l am a B.Com graduate
from Guruvayoorappan College

142
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,204
...before entering the rice business

143
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,365
- What about you?
- He has passed the 9th class

144
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,500
- What? - lt is betterto tell
that he has failed 10th class

145
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,512
- Who is this? - What aunt?
- ls it Prakasan?

146
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,208
l have told you to bring me
a calf long back!

147
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,848
Tell me how much commission you need?

148
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,612
Then the calf and its mom
will come to you!

149
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,952
He won't ask me any commission!
He is the brother in law of him!

150
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,184
Go and make tea, mom

151
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,960
- Won't you take food?
- l have to

152
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,930
Land broker... Marriage broker...
and now calf broker

153
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,439
l want to tell an urgent matter to you
Will you come out?

154
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,531
l'll come!
You start and l will be coming soon

155
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,009
Don't ask me any money
l am down this month financially

156
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,172
Take courage l won't ask you any money
Don't get delayed

157
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,946
Roychan's hotel is off today, isn't it?
The full team is enjoying orchestra

158
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,960
- JP! You are not to be seen these days!
- l've enough problems!

159
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,537
lt's long time since we heard your song!

160
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,072
Where is time to sing?
l'm on the move!

161
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,003
- Will you song this song?
- l have no touch these days

162
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,781
- lt is only 2 lines!
- God! Give me the mike

163
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,489
Oh! My lover! Your thoughts!

164
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:57,638
This river, twilights, and

165
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:02,846
...blue eye lids

166
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:07,883
With the feathers spread in the memories

167
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:12,547
...and have come running

168
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,618
Oh! My lover! Your thoughts!

169
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:20,491
This river, twilights, and

170
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:25,395
...blue eye lids

171
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,231
in the memories...

172
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,074
No chance, Beena has come

A human being should learn
to sing a song well

176
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,122
Doctors do not have any taste for music!

177
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,785

00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,163
They'll have to discuss
with the manager orthe advocate

195

196
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,201

- ls this KTC films?
- This is not KTC Films now

204
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,736
Now it is the real estate business

205
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,970
Estate? What estate?

206
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,042
Estate means selling and buying land!

207
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,409

247
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:16,823
How can we say that?

248
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,156

275

lt's in the town only...Nadakkavil

280
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,811

lt is actually in Vandipetta!

287
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,865
lt is 65 cents land,
but the house is old

288
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,801
l want to sell it at the earliest

289
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,709
The price of the house will be less
As the house is an old one

290
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,272
The land will have a sale value
and that's enough

291
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,539
ls it your house or property
of every one in the family?

Do you have any children?
Have the partition over?.

My children are abroad
They have no intention to come here

296
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,724
They only want
the money after selling this

297
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,188
The documents...?

298
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,521

00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,571

Rainikka should allow

317
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,631
No commission should be encouraged

318
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,364
Land in Mercara!
65 cent land in the town!

319
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,210
The signs of prosperity are seen!

320
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,813
- Don't call Rainikka
- Then?

321

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,643
Take your scooter and go
Go

345
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,633
l showed the documents to the advocate
lt is all ok!

346
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:02,798
- We have to give a name to it
- My name is Achutha Menon

347
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,134
l have told you earlier
Who else want a name?

348
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:09,680
- Don't you have a name?
- Giving a name is a practice for the brokers

349
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,339
We consider that as fixing a rate!

350
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,650
Please sit in the sitting room
l'll come now

351
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,722
lt looks as a poor atmosphere

352
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:25,053
No signs of prosperity here!

353
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:30,562
House, Parents, the old brass
vessels, furniture

354
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,236
The children go abroad leaving all these!

355
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:38,608
- He could ask 0.9 -1 million for a cent
- He is a retired tiger!

356
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,678
- He should be chained well
- He is coming!

357
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,650
2 groups came to me when l decided to sell

358
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,979
My rate was 0.6 million for a cent

359
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,084
l have no idea to sell it less than it

360
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,316
The market is dull now altogether

361
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,256
Dubai people's rush is almost stopped

362
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,252
lf the commerce buildings are to build

363
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,353
...there are damn laws induced
by the corporation

364
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,329
The area of the car parking
and the number of floors

365
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,492
the depth of piling! Damn it

366
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,129
No one like to build a house
in the middle of the road

367
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,799
- There is a nuisance by the thieves too!
- Very nuisance

368
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:14,675
...enough! l don't want to hear
the brokers' ready made talk

369
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,644
l have no time to hear it

370
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,513
l'll tell you a rate!

371
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:23,318
lf it is okay with you,
you can go further into it

372
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,985
Sir can tell it

373
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,757
- l want to get 0.8 million for a cent
- 0.8

374
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,823
Oops! 0.8 million will be large money for us

375
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:36,395
- Now it is your turn!
- Tell me what is your rate

376
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,802
lf you have to ask somebody, go ahead

377
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:47,105
1 minute! Rainikka!

378
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:53,713
We are at the spot
What is our final decision?

379
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:59,287
- How much shall we ask?
- Tell him it is 0.95

380
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,291
Syriyak is ok to give up to 11

381
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,324
See that if it can be fixed at 0.95

382
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:09,032
- Can we go down if needed?
- That is for you

383
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,566
l know that you won't change the rate

384
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:16,801
- Yet l am asking you...Are you sure?
- Yes

385
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,314
What?

386
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:26,976
There won't be a place available
in Kozhikode market

387
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,145
You have to find a place
in Koyilandi, Payyoli or somewhere

388
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,917
Yes, it will sound as a big sum!

389
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,049
lf you sell it again,
the price will go up, right!

390
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,393
l am standing before him
l will tell the price

391
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,327
You can go ahead or other party is there

392
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,857
Sir! l'll tell the price for
the business to go on!

393
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,267
...in a minimum time,
say within 1 month!

394
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,041
- Tell the rate
- 0.75 million for a cent

395
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,576
0.75 million!

396
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,146
lt is a top deal! Stretch your hands

397
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,046
- Registration is in one month!
- Done!

398
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,253
lt is the get together of my MBBS batch
of 2008 l want to take leave for that

399
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,260
- You too have to come with me
- l am asking you why!

400
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,629
What am l supposed to do there?

401
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,326
For Mysore Dussera there is a
usage of Nai Kudunga

402
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,267
My situation will also be like that

403
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:25,432
The married and whose engagement
is over in my batch are coming

404
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,703
How can l go alone?

405
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,802
- This damage was done by you
- What's that?

406
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,349
l told you not to pass the SSLC exam!
But you have passed

407
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,579
l told you not to go for Pre-degree
But you entered it

408
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:40,180
l told you not to join MBBS
But you joined

409
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,553
Don't worry

410
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,218
When l introduce you to my friends

411
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,558
l'll tell them, that you are a
big real estate dealer

412
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,965
- There are 2 conditions
- What?

413
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,071
Don't introduce me to anyone there

414
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,603
- l'll have two drinks and come
- Only 2 drinks!

415
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,307
You are paying for that
You can decide how much

416
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,414
For sometime, l wanted to give
some pain in the doctors' neck

417
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,780
- lt will work out today
- You JP

418
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:51,993
This river, twilights, and

419
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:57,098
...blue eye lids

420
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:02,562
With the feathers spread in the memories

421
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:07,675
...and have come running

422
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,321
My lover! Your thoughts!

423
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:29,297
This river, twilights, and

424
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:34,900
...blue eye lids

425
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:50,545
Your lips my lover,
craves for the kiss!

426
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:56,661
What would the moon told the cloud?

427
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,727
Your lips my lover,
craves for the kiss!

428
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:10,205
What would the moon told the cloud?

429
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,208
The bed room of the moon light

430
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:18,074
The stars are the friends who

431
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:24,051
...have poured the elation and
would it have forgotten

432
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:30,224
Will it forget the old elation?

433
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:36,726
Why your face has been reddened?

434
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:43,907
This river and the twilights...

435
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,417
lt is many nights and the pearly dreams!

436
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:07,054
Blossomed days...
and will those fade away?

437
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:13,664
lt is many nights and the pearly dreams!

438
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:20,004
Blossomed days...
and will those fade away?

439
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,147
ln the limit of sky of love...

440
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:29,514
Like birds with wings of
desire flying high

441
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:34,081
...did we forget that time?

442
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:39,991
Had the dream too faded off?

443
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:46,698
l was down with the flower of tears!

444
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:51,704
This river, twilights, and

445
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:56,811
...blue eye lids

446
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:02,276
With the feathers spread in the memories

447
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,557
...and have come running

448
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,350
My lover! Your thoughts!

449
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:15,463
This river, twilights, and

450
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:21,000
...blue eye lids!

451
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:59,437
- Sir! Get this, it is 0.5 million as a token
- l didn't ask you

452
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,544
There is a formal as the
things are set right

453
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,580
You have to do the registration fast

454
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:10,080
l can't handle this much amount
Somebody might kill me to get that

455
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,822
You need not have to keep it with you
You can remit in the bank

456
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,154
l have no bank account!

457
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,456
Even the beggars have bank account,
ATM card & PAN card

458
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,121
lncome tax raid to add to it

459
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:24,234
ln any case we can start an account
Larger payments are yet to come

460
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:29,462
There are nobody to do the
formalities for me for a help

461
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,167
Forget that lt is just a phone call
and the Bank will come here

462
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,147
lDlDl

463
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,730
Why don't you sit properly and eat?
Both are sitting in a lousy way

464
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,665
Mom!

465
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,263
- Bride is a doctor!
- What?

466
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:40,133
l was telling the name of an old film
-Why do you want to tell it now?

467
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,871
The 2nd part is coming
Groom is SSLC passed

468
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,411
You nasty dog

469
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:51,277
Do you believe that this marriage
will happen with your family's consent?

470
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,854
As long her dad is alive
there is no chance for that

471
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,927
Don't expect him to die one of these days

472
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,425
lf he is not going to die
we will kill him by the help of somebody

473
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,562
Who is it?
Pradeep!

474
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,804
Police have reached just
when the slaughter is planned

475
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,669
Why are you in this dress?
Sit and have some tea

00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,809
l am on duty
You finish eating and come

477
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,444
- What is it?
- There is nothing to get scared

478
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,249
lt is a small issue of the
Nadakkavu property sale

479
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,115
l don't know any details

480
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,688
Commissioner and AC are there in the spot

481
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,331
- You are asked to come to the station
- What's it Pradeep?

482
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,728
There is no problem teacher
lt isjust to take his statement

- ls there any problem, brother?.

486
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,048
DlSTRlCT COLLECTOR

487
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,361
What's the problem?

488
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,902
This house is on sale!
There are some problems because of it

489
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:17,975
Who has sold the house?

490
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:21,442
This is the house of External minister
Sankara Menon's ancestral house!

491
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,982
l know it! The Commissioner and collector
came here for that, right?

492
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,709
Who have sold it to whom?

493
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,650
lt was his dad who have done this business

494
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,263
lt is my father!

495
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:48,396
He left the house when
l was doing my school final!

496
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:54,968
l saw him later when mom's body was buried
in the burial ground among the spectators

497
00:36:55,346 --> 00:37:02,809
My sister and me knew it that my dad and
mom were legally separated years ago

498
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,081
But mom has not informed to us

499
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:13,561
Before sister went to US and
l went to Delhi he came again to see us

500
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:19,029
He asked me shelter to stay
and l gave him permission to stay here

501
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:24,633
l happened to know now his plan by chance
to sell this house

502
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:30,744
He has no power to do that

503
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,478
We happened to know that a buyer came
and gave the token advance

504
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:42,426
He has remitted it in a new lDlDl Bank

505
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,552
He took about 25000 Rs from that

506
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,088
You have to give that back to the buyers

507
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,099
l'll give you 25000 Rs

508
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,698
The party has come
who has bought the land

509
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,171
Call them

510
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,187
Hope you have understood the matter!

511
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:15,391
You have to come to the North AC's office
with the original agreement

512
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,461
- Understand?
- We will come sir

513
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,189
You have to take the amount in the bank
and give that back to them

514
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,333
We have already got
a signed check leaf from him

515
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,801
lt is to get back
the balance money from him

516
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:31,132
l knew that he has no powerto sell it

517
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:35,338
lf you are interested in it
we will sell it at the said price

518
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,808
The Bangalore party is ready now

519
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,282
Whoever it is,
we want to finish the business

520
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,410
l told him that it is 7.5
Don't take it serious

521
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,751
8.5, 8.75!!

522
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,153
We have to finish it in only a sitting

523
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,885
- What?
- Take them away

524
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,624
Go from here
l told you to go out

525
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,961
- Go out! lt's for you too
- Don't push me

526
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,604
The media shouldn't know it at any case

527
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,400
You two have to be careful

528
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,610
So that's how it goes!

529
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:30,251
See how he sits... damn it!
l'll hit you!

530
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,193
- Poor guy!
- ls he?

531
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,992
He has tried to sell the house
cheating his children

532
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,797
Children! His son has deserted him!

533
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:44,063
He wouldn't need to spent much money
for his dad as to a dog

534
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:48,073
You can't hide
the truth with coat and suit

535
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,682
l wanted to escape from that
by doing a fraud

536
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,620
l understood that there
is no easy way for that

537
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,817
l am ready to accept
the punishment for the fraud done by me

538
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,488
Don't beat me up
l can stand the pain

539
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:09,155
lt could affect the children of yours

540
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,167
- lt's not needed
- Where to...?

541
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:16,706
There are long railway tracks!

542
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,503
Do you want to go for a journey?
Or is it to end your life?

543
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,569
- lt is suitable for both
- l've not decided any thing else

544
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,728
Joy! See who have come!

545
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,334
Did you get back the advance of 0.5 million?

546
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,197
Oh! Who do you think l am?

547
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,602
How was it?

548
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:57,204
Forthe party the cost was 0.75 for a cent
The sale for 0.95!

549
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,509
0.2 million for a cent!

550
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,051
65 cent of the land in total!

551
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,780
13 millions profit!

552
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,187
lt is as if the balloon has exploded

553
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,718
Our history is something different
like climbing a palm tree!

554
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:15,663
You have to climb
every step of the tree with care

555
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,595
Who is there not expecting
any profit in a business?

556
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,731
There is no history which says the business
goes in the same way for no one!

557
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:30,075
Then the do's don'ts of real estate!
That was taught by you!

558
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:35,345
There are some laws
in lndia for any business!

559
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:40,890
lndia the great was born from a big
real estate deal!

560
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,221
The British gave the property
back to us it is the

561
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,227
...fight forthe manager's
post of that, right?

562
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,559
Cut in 2 pieces...gave 2 names

563
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,293
...registered in the name of 2 parties
and solved the problem!!

564
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:54,303
Then on, we learned the tricks and pranks
of the real estate business and following it

565
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,432
Don't teach him any social studies
We take leave then!

566
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,102
lf any thing useful comes,
don't forget to inform us

567
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,111
We will be here only
Come

568
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,442
Ok, then

569
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,051
Mom, tea!

570
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,261
Money chain!

571
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:27,269
The dist. judge loses 7.5 millions

572
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,528
The dist. Judge loses too!

573
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,369
This money should go into the real estate!

574
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:34,774
You have cheated a housewife
that she would get

575
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,779
...the double if she remit in the real estate

576
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,247
- Who is that woman?
- lt's me!

577
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:45,251
You will get back 3 times of the money
which you gave me for a necessity

578
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:47,381
lt is running in the deal market now

579
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:50,051
ls it any cat or dog for that?

580
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,924
l don't want any profit or interest
l want only my principal

581
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:58,525
Principal? You mean 0.3 million right?

582
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,933
That money is meagerfor you!

583
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:05,270
lf l search your shirt
there won't be even 30 rupees

584
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,003
You won't have it if
you search Ambanis' pocket!

585
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,272
We don't carry any cash with us

586
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,540
Where are you going wearing sari?

587
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:18,210
- l'm not to anywhere!
- You look well dressed!

588
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,950
-Aren't they coming today?
- Who is it?

589
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:25,086
Ooch! lt is them!
Sathish and his family

590
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:29,631
Oh! For engagement!
Was it today?

591
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,167
They are not coming for
engagement it is to...

592
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,167
...discuss the matters and
keep it as a secret

593
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,432
The date and otherthings

594
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,237
You have to ask them about the
gold ornaments apart from money!

595
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,574
...and you have to settle the matter

596
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,371
When will you give me back my 0.3 million?

597
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,313
You'll have to tell me that too!

598
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:55,121
The 0.3 million and the extra money
from here and there

599
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,591
We have to perform
the marriage with all this money

600
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,922
Are you old enough to get married?

601
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,965
Don't force me to tell the reply for that

602
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,228
Go and take bath!
They will come now

603
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,299
lt is the marriage of the reputed
real estate broker's sister

604
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,771
...in the Kozhikode market

605
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,774
Perform it in a grand way

606
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,105
The mother and daughter
of the real estate broker

607
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,841
...have to see the real me!

608
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,276
Mom!

609
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,809
lt is switched off mom

610
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,338
He will do it
He is of that kind

611
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,210
l know what has to be done

612
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,945
l'll perform the marriage by selling
this house and land!

613
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,146
The rest of the money is to be
deposited in the bank in your account

614
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,018
l won't give him even a paisa!

615
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,352
That's a good idea!

616
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:05,485
- Where will mom go?
- l'll go to Kasi!

617
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:10,027
lsn't it an old, outdated dialogue?
Change your place!

618
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,163
l'll come after a bath!
The rascal will come by then!

619
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,500
lt is switched off now

620
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,832
ls there any body here?

621
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:29,383
- l want to see Jaya Prakash
- He is not here

622
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:35,223
- Will he come now?
- We too are waiting for him

623
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,519
Come and sit

624
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,771
l went to his office

625
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,435
Ganesan has told me the way to here

626
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,171
Ganesan has called several times
in the mobile l couldn't get it

627
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:03,049
- You want to drink anything?
- 1 cup of tea if you won't bother!

628
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:09,015
- Did you have anything to eat?
- Only tea will do

629
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:13,619
- Will you mind if l give you 2 idlies?
- No

630
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,684
Why do you want to see my brother?

631
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:39,483
Do you have any idea to buy or sell land?

632
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,219
l had an idea for that
That's why l came to meet him

633
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:49,689
But now l came here to see
if he could handle the work!

634
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:54,162
Any work which suits me at this age!

635
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,968
All say that he is the best man
to give work to others

636
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,872
- God!
- What's it?

637
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:06,813
lt is some work for my brother!

638
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,118
lt's the team for my proposal!

639
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,720
- Take the plates
- What about tea?

640
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:18,219
But my hunger has subsided
l don't want it as it is luxury

641
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:19,454
l'll have it later

642
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,569
- Please come!
- Greetings!

643
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,100
Please sit

644
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:42,977
- l think we have met...
- No! This is the first time

645
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,986
You look very familiarto me

646
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:48,921
- May l know about you?
- l am...

647
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,727
Sit son! Prakash has gone out
He will come now

648
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,297
Let him come
We will leave now

649
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,526
An old man is admitted in the BMS
with poor condition

650
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,570
- We want to meet him there
-About the date

651
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,604
We have fixed Nov 26 Saturday

652
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,337
All can come for the marriage that day
as it is a holiday!

653
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,912
What do you say, madam?

654
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:12,678
You can have it if you feel right

655
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:19,484
That day may not be a good choice

656
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:28,288
As told by eminent astrologers

657
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:32,494
lt is dangerous if Saturday and
Thriketta come together

658
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,268
Was it told by any astrologer?

659
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:40,607
Yes! He is not a famous man
He is from our place

660
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:47,549
lt is not an auspicious day
You can select Nov 21

661
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:55,019
Being a suitable day for Lord Krishna
it is auspicious

662
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,559
lf you want, you can consult
a good astrologer

663
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,892
Ok then! lt is November 21 Monday

664
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,971
You know the details

665
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,539
What will you give
your girl as dowry?

666
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:15,174
We have to answer them if anybody ask us

667
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:19,042
Only then they'll have
a good opinion about us

668
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:25,216
Nobody like those who get money as dowry
lt is good to give as golden ornaments!

669
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:31,658
lt is funny to know
that this attitude have not changed

670
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:36,861
ls marriage a business deal
fixed by the parents?

671
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,401
lt should be a decision taken
by the girl and boy full heartedly

672
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:44,270
That's right! lt's the beginning
of a new relationship aftertheir meeting!

673
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,138
Why then they have avoided this business?

674
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:54,948
Will they be able to forget
their love in terms of money?

675
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,480
l don't accuse any old people

676
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:03,290
They just repeat
what their old generation did

677
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,793
But it is pitiful about the young ones!

678
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:11,261
When they see a girl instead of asking her
whether she likes him

679
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,599
...it is better to ask
how much property she has!

680
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,672
Then the matter would be easy!

681
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,605
Sorry! We haven't come
to receive the dowry

682
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:22,269
lf you feel so, l ask you to pardon us

683
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:26,145
No! We wanted to know
as we are curious about it

684
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,484
Yes! You have to know

685
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,687
You should know
that the dowry will not be less

686
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:37,360
You spoil the peaceful
atmosphere of a family by that

687
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,228
No! l am telling you
l have no demand for me

688
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:44,596
l am ready if you perform
the marriage in a register office

689
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,172
lt is your promise
to your girl for a bright life

690
00:51:54,277 --> 00:52:00,512
...is valuable than handful of
golden ornaments as dowry

691
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,516
You have asked me who l am

692
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,386
You can take me for a passer-by

693
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,252
lf my talk has hurt anybody,
sorry forthat

694
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:18,664
No sir! You would have come here
to teach me this

695
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:29,140
When l came here starving,
she was ready to give me food

696
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:33,546
lt is her mind which will be
the most valuable dowry for you

697
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,412
See you then! God bless you!

698
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,749
- Faizal!
- l know him

699
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:11,015
lt belongs to Papanchettan
who runs the Golden chit company

700
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,145
We heard that it is for sale

701
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,745
That is not yet been sold

702
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,018
The party l brought has given the advance

703
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,391
As their business is dull, they dropped
their idea and were gone

704
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,788
How much do they demand?

705
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,796
He asked not less than 1 billion

706
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:29,668
He came down to 850 - 900 millions!
Not more than that

707
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,667
You tell it to Rainikka

708
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,866
You should have a big team to manage

709
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,940
- lt is Sajitha from home
- Don't take

710
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,275
You know why she has called?

711
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:42,340
- Me...You know something
- Talk

712
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:50,081
So things are solved
You can come home boldly

713
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:52,423
Sathisan do not want any money or gold

714
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,954
He is ready to take free delivery

715
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:57,689
lt was Menon sir who have saved us

716
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,701
You have to give him proper care

717
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,341
He was in the station!

718
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,415
Did you find it difficult?
Keep the box inside

719
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,920
How long will you live
in a railway retiring room?

720
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,254
lf you don't mind you can stay with us

721
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,389
Our life is like the fishermen's life

722
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,655
We will starve at times
or will have enough food for us at times

723
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,324
You have asked for a job, what l heard

724
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,124
We will search for it
Sir come in

725
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,599
Thank you very much

726
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:39,798
l didn't pose a problem to anyone

727
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,536
You can ask me to vacate
if you wanted to

728
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,408
l wanted to reciprocate your help

729
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:47,005
My sister's marriage will be performed
without any problems

730
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,673
You are the reason for that

731
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:55,155
He will be here
till he get a job and place to live

732
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:59,584
Nobody will ask you the ticket
when travel in a drowning boat

733
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,685
Let him get in

734
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,891
Your entry is on an un cheerful day

735
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,868
- What's it?
- Samuelettan called from Viraj petta

736
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:12,231
Shiela Koshy's estate has sold
by a team from lrutti

737
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:16,538
What have they done?

738
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,146
They gave the signed authorization
to us forthe sale of the estate

739
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:22,943
Tear off the document and ask Ganesh
to prepare a black tea

740
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,847
The business has to procure
25 millions as commission!

741
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:30,790
We wouldn't be able to come out of
Rainikka and Joyettan's shade

742
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,987
Why don't we call Shiela Koshy?

743
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:35,189
We can tell what
she has done is a nasty thing

744
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:36,322
For the peace of mind

745
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,632
We have to go and see her in person

746
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:48,107
When you go,
you take a pre-dated stamp paper

747
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:51,180
...saying that it is decided
to sell the estate to another party

748
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:56,309
...and there should be a check
for an advance amount, with it

749
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,184
...and keep it before her with respect

750
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,383
Who is this guy?
There is no one like him

751
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:04,323
There is
l am that buyer

752
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:06,854
What about the check?

753
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,959
l have the old check book with me

754
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,897
lt is lDlDl Bank's

755
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,696
There could be stamp papertoo

756
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:17,099
What if she tell that
the estate has been sold out?

757
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,572
She should not tell that

758
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:23,911
Then it will be cheatery
she has done to you

759
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,838
We have to get the compensation for that

760
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,576
Or else, tell her
she would land up in the court

761
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:32,184
She'll compensate you when she finds that
she'll face problem to sell her land

762
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,957
- How much we can ask her?
- 5

763
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,618
lf you get only 2.5 million,
accept it and come

764
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,291
ls it right?
She is innocent!

765
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:47,502
Forget that

766
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,973
Try to escape when your boat
is getting drowned by catching a hay

767
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:57,508
You should have only
the feeling in your mind

768
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,447
...that you got only
2.5 millions instead of 25 millions

769
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,891
Where were you all this time?

770
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,826
We have told you before
if a better offer comes we will fix it

771
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,168
We haven't come empty handed now

772
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,834
We fixed that amount with the party
at 2 millions per acre

773
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,434
He gave a token advance to us for 2.5 millions

774
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:33,175
We have given the word

775
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:36,919
They have given a small amount as advance

776
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,384
You should have given
a word to us before that

777
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,047
That's a wrong thing on my part

778
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:45,816
Madam can talk to Menon sir in person

779
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,897
lf he is willing to vacate,
we can go

780
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:50,022
How can we vacate?
Menon sir won't vacate

781
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,361
Keep quiet!

782
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,237
Ganesa! Give it to Menon sir

783
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,900
Sir! lts JP Brother

784
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:01,574
Take it

785
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:05,273
No one told me that
you are lying

786
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:07,911
You talk to him any way

787
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,378
l will put you in speaker mode

788
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:07,874
That's him madam

789
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,241
He is a millionaire!
and a problematic too

790
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,005
lf he comes to know that this land
has slipped his fingers

791
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,742
He wouldn't deny to give
the quotation to kill me

792
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,645
He says he has connection
with the under world in Mali island

793
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:20,723
For Menon sir, he missed to
get the estate, he wanted to have

794
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:24,657
See our case
lt is 25 millions worth business

795
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:28,092
We can manage Menon sir
by falling on his legs!

796
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:30,529
But if we don't get anything?

797
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,793
- Give us a compensation and bail us
- Yes

798
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,331
Why madam?
l say, we don't want anything like that

799
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,634
This signed paper is
enough to stop the sale

800
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,505
Do you want that?

801
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,545
Don't think like that
She will give us something

802
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,977
Will 5 millions be enough for the business?

803
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,346
We should be given that much

804
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,282
But when she says to reduce it
we have to reduce

805
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,888
So it is not good
to be adamant on a figure!

806
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,217
The lawyer has come!

807
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,530
Are these the brokers you told?

808
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:05,566
You told it's very threatening!

809
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,363
Come!

810
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,754
The lawyer has come
Will the police follow him up?

811
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,083
lf l feel something fishy l will run!

812
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:31,225
Karnataka police are very talented!

813
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,554
What was it? We have to ask 5 millions and

814
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,254
...get it if it is only 2.5 millions

815
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,964
My Menon! lt was almost like killing!

816
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,359
We should as well get it
lf it is only a meager money

817
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:41,730
Why don't we ask it?

818
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,138
To stop the registration

819
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,174
...the sale authorization
duly signed by doctor

820
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:47,401
...is good enough

821
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,445
Give them half amount
and get the papers from them!

822
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,949
2.5 millions is too much!
ls it needed?

823
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:59,350
lf they go to the court,
they could give us problem!

824
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,322
We will have to go after it for sometime
That's all

825
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:06,689
There is no time for that
Give them whatever it is

826
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:15,462
- He is coming!
- Who?

827
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,608
lt is not forthe threatening you made!
lt's to avoid nuisance from you

828
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,802
You have to give back the paper to us

829
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:24,675
You have to sign the paper l give you

830
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,214
You will get 25 rupees!

831
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,340
- What do you mean by 25?
- 25000...

832
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:32,945
- 2.5 millions
- That is... 2.5 millions

833
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:35,320
- Will that be enough?
- You have to accept it

834
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:39,794
l told a decent amount
to avoid the cheap talk of the negotiation

835
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:43,628
That is...we will decide that is enough

836
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:46,258
What shall we do now other than that?

837
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:08,149
2.5 millions of lndian Rupees!

838
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:18,696
We should have said a word to Beena!
That's a fault on our part

839
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:26,440
Had you said to herthe money
would have been with Shiela Koshy!

840
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,969
...and you both would have been poor!

841
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:40,279
lf you get money without shame...
it's shame to change the money

842
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,016
The song is really truthful!

843
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:56,094
lf this 2.5 millions be given to you free
your problems will be gone, right?

844
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,105
No chance
There will be a little ease

845
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:01,040
All of my problems will vanish
l wouldn't go for any work

846
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:06,714
lf this money is robbed by someone
you will feel very much, right?

847
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,443
- There will be one feeling!
- What's that feeling?

848
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:09,916
You won't be able to come for my burial

849
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,179
l will kill you and go to the jail!

850
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,982
Move away from here
You are bothering me!

851
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:17,758
lt wouldn't become more
if you couldn't again and again

852
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:18,827
l feel very comfortable!

853
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:22,227
We don't know how long it'll be here
lt is a comfortable feeling to touch

854
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,959
Shouldn't we have to buy
something for touching?

855
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:26,694
- Good!
- l'll go and buy it

856
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:30,034
Go! A funny guy!

857
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:33,768
- Sir! Has the lnternet become ok?
- lt's ok

858
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:39,007
lt had a connection before
The big people here won't like

859
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:40,207
...when the bills came every month!

860
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:42,879
We can pay the bill now correct!

861
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:49,752
lt's someone who doesn't know English

862
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:52,556
- What's it?
-Appachan(dad)?

863
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,961
You mean Ouseppachan of the cycle shop?

864
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:58,033
He is not here for the last 2 days
That's his room

865
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:03,970
We were asked to come here at this address!
He told me he will be here

866
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:06,234
Who will be that?

867
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,440
Are you Chandu kutty amma?
Our KT?

868
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:13,111
- Ganesan, send them in
- Come in

869
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,653
ls Menon sirtheir appachan?

870
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,050
ls Appachan Menon his name?

871
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:27,062
Appachan! Appachan!

872
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:44,405
- Mary! Appachan!
- l saw him!

873
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,013
Why is the delay?

874
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:48,182
l had to change 2 buses!

875
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:51,912
We had to come with him in future
He won't stay quiet

876
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,689
Mary! Appachan!

877
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,024
How is your leg now?

878
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:03,197
That is...
Did you have any food?

879
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,864
l had lunch!
l want parotta and meat

880
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:11,768
- Meat and parotta!
- Ganesan!

881
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:14,132
l have money
l'll buy it

882
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,982
They will give you
Keep quiet, will you?

883
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,583
Are they his son and daughter?

884
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,481
He is a Menon!
How can he be a Christian uncle then?

885
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:31,082
Religion and caste are not
a problem to beget children!

886
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,457
Only the religion of born children
would be a problem!

887
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,892
He is a suspense thriller!

888
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,001
What is your mom's...

889
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,597
She is bedridden after
we have come out of the house

890
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:47,899
Didn't Philipose send you
out of the house?

891
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,472
lt is 0.6 million which we got at times!

892
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:54,045
lt has been 2.5 millions with interest
and compound interest

893
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,945
We will get the document back
only if we give the money back

894
01:05:57,053 --> 01:05:59,385
They told the stay there
will be after that

895
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:02,013
They locked the house
and went away one day

896
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:04,488
We were ashamed by this

897
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:06,823
That's why we went to
Koottu Puraile Mathu Papan

898
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,587
Now we are staying
at the corner of his tea shop

899
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:12,092
l do the kitchen work and
cleaning of the vessels

900
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,835
We will get food for 3 times!

901
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,141
lf Appachan comes there
and give some money

902
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:23,404
...Kuriakkos boss would give the house back

903
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:30,851
l'm not going to house today

904
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,513
25 is their problem too

905
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,413
You stay inside the box

906
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:36,852
l will call you tomorrow

907
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,686
- Mom! Food!
- Parotta and meat

908
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,291
Keep quiet

909
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,167
- Can l have some water?.
- Sure

910
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:50,235
- Parotta...
- l'll hit you

911
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:53,671
- Parotta and meat
- Have it

912
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:55,538
Stay here and you can go tomorrow

913
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,041
- We can go tomorrow
- Ok! Have this!

914
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,106
We can go tomorrow
We can go tomorrow

915
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,242
- My Jesus!
- Parotta and meat!

916
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,320
Let me take it out

917
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:08,314
They are my children

918
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:13,058
l had a plenty of fancy dress in a birth

919
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:17,428
That is Gopala Menon's personality

920
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:21,234
A blade company owner took away

921
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,562
...the house and land
l built for them

922
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,133
Mom and 2 children in the road!
l have to help them

923
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,278
My legs are not strong enough to stand

924
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,409
But l won't be able to
close my eyes on that issue

925
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,680
Sir! 2.5 millions are in this

926
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:42,147
This was earned by the brain of Menon sir

927
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:45,849
lf this is to divide we won't tell
the percentage matter

928
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,998
How much do you need from this?

929
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:53,830
l need 500 Rupees
to sent them back in the morning!

930
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:02,166
Can l call to overseas
from Prakash's phone?

931
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:03,807
l have lSD in my phone!

932
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:08,112
A little liquortoo

933
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:13,215
...to lit up the brain from the darkness

934
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:38,079
Menon sir! Who are you really?

935
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:47,085
ln the start of 1960, l had my BL
from Madras Law College

936
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,554
l came to Kozhikode

937
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:52,318
l was interested in the things
that happened outside the court!

938
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:56,827
When my belief in
the political sciences have lost

939
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,695
Gandhism, Socialism, Communism etc.,

940
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,909
The Mantra Dheekshas...
which l received one by one

941
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:12,670
Ammu alias Lakshmi Amma!
My first wife

942
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:16,216
Her elite class cleanliness...

943
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:19,850
Stinking nobility's ruling!

944
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,284
l left it when it was unbearable!

945
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:27,457
l was manager in the
tea estate in Cuddalore

946
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,797
A girl named Gracy
who was doing the house hold work

947
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,926
...and to share my bed

948
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:36,929
She was the daughter of
a poor estate worker

949
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,702
These two children were born
before l left Cuddalore

950
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:44,777
l bought a house and land
in lrutti and stayed there!

951
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:48,880
Some Christian wanted to
change my son a Christian!

952
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:51,982
There is no difficulty to get a new name!

953
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:55,256
lf a new physic and mind
can be offered by the church!

954
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,631
When it was not possible
to get a groom for my daughter

955
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:07,065
l left that place and started roaming!
There was no use!

956
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:09,937
lt was not because the child
was of a inter caste marriage

957
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:14,133
Unworthy thing which can't be sold
in dowry market...

958
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:16,644
Give me the phone

959
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:22,243
- Who are you calling in midnight?
- We are in the darkness!

960
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,653
lt is dawn on the other side of the world!

961
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:29,984
My girl in America!
the son in Geneva

962
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:32,391
ln the foreigner's language

963
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,755
...if their step brother and step sister

964
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:38,526
...could be saved from
the house near a tea shop

965
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:42,361
ln a way 2 children to retrieve the land

966
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:47,932
The other 2 children are
to undergo emotional back-mail...

967
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:00,581
2 coffee

968
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,124
When the call from CH's phone came

969
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:07,559
The daughter in America
and the son from Geneva

970
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:08,755
...appeared in the internet

971
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:09,625
ls it web camera?

972
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,791
No camera! Through dialogue!

973
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,768
lt was a threatening letter in detail
that he'll offerjob by committing suicide

974
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,300
- Bonda!
- No (Venda)

975
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:22,941
What work?

976
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,370
That would be the notice of a poor dad

977
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:28,314
...who has to starve even though he have
2 well placed children!

978
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:29,979
Why do they have to worry about that?

979
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,651
Their mom and Menon are
legally separated, right?

980
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:36,948
You can tell it in the court

981
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:42,023
His son is the UNN's...Damn it

982
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,120
ls he the Secretary General?

983
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:47,898
He could stand in the position of
Secretary General as lndia's representative!

984
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,301
lf they get a news like this
the national media will celebrate it!

985
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:54,639
He is a national star!
That too a Malayali!

986
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,438
lt is a wonderful chance!

987
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,303
What happened at the end?

988
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:02,043
The children agreed to
give 2.5 millions!

989
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:06,249
You have a master in the fraud game

990
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:09,247
You give the bill

991
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:12,122
Somebody is coming to buy
the Golden mall! He is an NRl tiger!

992
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:15,594
lt is a matter of money, dear!

993
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:25,597
- Greetings sir!

994
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:29,974
- l am here

995
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,114
This is the property!

996
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,982
Who is the one with coat?

997
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:41,315
- Don't you know him?
- No

998
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,716
He is Madhu Soothana Panikker!

999
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,859
He has work in Dubai and Africa!

1000
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,053
lt is a matter of pea nuts for him

1001
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:50,131
We can have a talk
and come to a conclusion today

1002
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:54,668
Has he got the Padma sri award?

1003
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,330
l heard, he would get it this time

1004
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,669
He looks stubborn
Can't you see that?

1005
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:22,119
- Do you know him?
- No

1006
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:24,026
He is the Golden Papan!

1007
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,668
Why is he standing on a blue fly?

1008
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,671
He has enough money to buy a car!

1009
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:35,472
He is the top most miser in the place!

1010
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:45,420
This is his character!

1011
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:47,489
He just has to put it in the stand

1012
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,348
He has something in his mind

1013
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:51,085
He would work for it,
until he finishes it

1014
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:08,333
- Jesus!
- Greetings Papan chettan

1015
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,474
Greetings Rainikka!
Do you go to the club?

1016
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,145
How are you Joey?

1017
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:14,408
You have put up some weight!

1018
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:15,744
- l am little thin!
- Grown up little fatter

1019
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:18,479
Jesus! Who is it?
Hai Ahmedka!

1020
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:21,488
- Don't call me ikka!
- l'll call!

1021
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,558
The word Golden is only in name

1022
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:28,687
- You are keen on the Kerala gold business!
- l'm Panikker, sir!

1023
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,428
l have heard of you very much!

1024
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:32,659
Now l can see you and touch you!

1025
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:37,796
Do you want to go in
or sit and discuss things?

1026
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:38,930
- Shall we sit then?
- Yes!

1027
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,474
- Then, we shall go to my house!
- Yes!

1028
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:55,418
-Are you going to Papanchettan's house?
- Take the vehicle!

1029
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:58,152
lf he is not with us,
our work would fail

1030
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:16,937
Don't close it
We are coming!

1031
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,175
lt is 5 to 6 years after my wife died

1032
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:22,440
l have 2 children

1033
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,383
The elder son is in America...in NASA!

1034
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:28,320
He is a scientist and
he married a Nair girl

1035
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:29,981
...not Nair, but a Menon!

1036
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,123
She too is in NASA!

1037
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:35,792
The young one is my daughter
She is a doctor and is in Bangalore!

1038
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,589
Her husband too!

1039
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,728
l have a plan to
bring them here!

1040
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,736
Let him do it
Do you have any objection?

1041
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:45,671
l am happy about it
l can see her!

1042
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:51,136
l bought the Calicut Medical center!
My situation would be very tight then!

1043
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:54,875
lt was! That's why l wanted
to sell the shopping moll!

1044
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:58,046
Shopping moll?
What is moll?

1045
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,713
lt's not moll, but mall!
Male

1046
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:03,313
Then came another problem

1047
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:06,724
My son called me from America
He wanted 2.5!

1048
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:07,988
lt is to give to his father in law!

1049
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:10,863
Raini! How much l asked you as advance?

1050
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:15,733
- Papanchettan asked me to give 1 .5
- ls it? l changed it now

1051
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:16,997
l need 2.5 now

1052
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,002
Our work will fail

1053
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,408
- Why?
- Watch it

1054
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:28,074
lt can be 2.5 or 5!
Papanchettan don't have to worry

1055
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,548
l can give you only account money

1056
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,551
How can it then?
l won't agree if l get only white

1057
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:37,489
Don't take it serious!
We will have solution!

1058
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,454
Do you agree with the money?
850 millions! How is it, chettan?

1059
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:45,730
lt was more than 1 billion, what have told!
850 millions...ok then!

1060
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:48,064
Shall we write it and sign by both of us?

1061
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:51,003
- Panikker sir will go to Dubai tomorrow
- ls it?

1062
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:55,070
To write...l have no practice in that

1063
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,607
l believe in my word!
l won't make any mistake

1064
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,805
l don't have any touch
with others who make mistakes!

1065
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:05,481
- This is only a formality!
- l have to send enough money then!

1066
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:13,019
lf l get 2.5 millions today
we can take it further ahead

1067
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:16,890
Eldose! Get some wheat porridge for me

1068
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,962
l take wheat porridge in the noon!

1069
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:20,534
l wouldn't invite anyone forthat

1070
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:23,270
Buy a good biriyani for
Panikker sir, Raini

1071
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:25,636
Take him to Paragon!
Buy him chicken!

1072
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:27,936
Ahmed! We have to talk...

1073
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:30,010
Papanchettan! We have to...

1074
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:43,618
- Raini! Who are these guys?
- They are my boys!

1075
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:47,019
l think they are commission agents
l'll tell you something!

1076
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:49,359
lf the commissioner comes
don't bring a group of people

1077
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:52,558
Don't tell me to
give to various people

1078
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,966
No! Let me solve this problem

1079
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,069
Swine!

1080
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:04,476
Don't discard at any cost!
85 is good enough to get!

1081
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,844
Call Ganesan!

1082
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:24,929
As you said
l'll give you 25 as token advance

1083
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:27,263
An agreement is written
with the payment schedule

1084
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,200
Registration is within 3 months!

1085
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:31,465
lf it is anyone
they will ask you 6 months time

1086
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:34,007
No need of that
We shall finish the work in 3 months

1087
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:36,737
Raini! l have to get my 25 today

1088
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:39,473
- Give the money and talk further
- Today is Sunday, right?

1089
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:41,481
Nobody will keep the money at home today

1090
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,608
Tomorrow when the bank opens
we will give you the money

1091
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:46,447
What is to get today
should get it today itself

1092
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:49,183
lf it is tomorrow,
there are a lot of things to see

1093
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:51,657
You should not be adamant like this

1094
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,456
Panikker sir! l asked you
as l have some urgent need

1095
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,258
Don't mistake me
Forget it

1096
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:58,130
There are people in the line!

1097
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:00,191
They are waiting for my call

1098
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,533
Ok! Then! You can leave now

1099
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:04,070
Let me have some food!
l feel hungry

1100
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:08,471
Brother! lf you can wait for 10 minutes
you will get 25 right now

1101
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:09,669
He has started to come

1102
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:18,411
25 means 2.5 millions!
What are you telling?

1103

01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:23,550
lt sounds good!

1105
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:24,818
Where will you get that money?

1106
01:19:24,926 --> 01:19:26,325
...from Palayam!
lt has reached here

1107
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,055
Who have asked the money from you?

1108
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:29,925
Don't say that

1109
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:33,057
lf he has arranged 25 lakh rupees
he is smart

1110
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:35,796
- What is your name?
- Jaya Prakash

1111
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:37,201

Who will bring it what you say?

1116

- Raini! Don't threaten him!
- l know about him

1117
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:03,161
Dear brother! l did it so that
the business would flourish

1118
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:04,892
You could as well return it to me tomorrow

1119
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,433
Cash has come

1120
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:38,761
You count it, Papanchetta

1121
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:40,698
l'll do it! l'll tell you
if there is any less amount

1122
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:42,360
You sit here
Tell me the name

- Do we need this, sir?
- What is the problem?

1126
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:58,816
We will give 25 to
the guy in the morning!

1127
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,148
We will give it

1128
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:02,155
He is a man who hasn't
got any value for his words

1129
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:03,622
He changes his words!

1130
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,751
Don't tell that Panikker sir
has cheated us

1131
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:08,757
Do what you feel like

1132
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,594
l like the property
l want the price too be reasonable

1133

That's all, l can say
What do you say?

That too is 1 lakh sq.feet

lf you don't believe it, forget it

1139
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:27,739
The deal with the nasty guy is not needed
Sir come

So...we take leave then

01:21:51,973 --> 01:21:54,874
- Cash!

1147
01:21:57,045 --> 01:22:01,345
Rainikka and Joyettan

1148
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:08,013
- l got it
-Aren't you going?

1149
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:09,620

Put the money in the box
without wasting time!

1152
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,883
What did you ask me?

1153
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:43,747
He was cracking a joke!

1154
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,694
l have no habit ofjoking
What l was asking...

1155
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:51,764
lf you have interest...
keep the cash down and shake my hand

4 floors! Parking lot for 100 cars!

1159
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:05,245
- Do you want it?
- l want it

01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,419
Today's date is 13

01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:21,358
Shake hands if you are ready

1164
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:26,832
- l'm ready!
- What ready? Are you mad?

1165
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,614
Are the details safe in your head?

1166
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:43,277
On 21st...10 millions

1167
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,815
lf not given,
2.5 millions will be gone what you gave!

1168
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:48,956
Remember, l didn't sign in any papers
that l took your money

1169
01:23:55,663 --> 01:24:02,330
lt's the first time in our life
we are watching 2.5 millions

1170
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:03,927
That was kept on your feet!

1171
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:08,836
We know, that money will be gone
if we can't maintain our words

1172
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:11,571
We have no strength
to grab the money from you

1173
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:20,153
l tell you, l will come on the 21st
...with 10 millions

1174
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:36,532
Listen! Yourtime is virtuous now!

1175
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:47,974
This courage has made
a big man big in this world

1176
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,720
Eldose! Take this and keep this inside

1177
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,620
Do you like to have this?
lt is wheat!

1178
01:24:57,592 --> 01:25:00,686
No brother!
We'll have another day

1179
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:06,461
Keep the box
in which the cash was brought

1180
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,433
Looks good!
We can dub things in it

1181
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:31,817
Menon sir! What are you doing here?

1182
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,493
This is my relative's house

1183
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:36,462
This is my son-in law's house
who is in America!

1184
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:40,664
She told me to get 2.5 millions from here

1185
01:25:42,604 --> 01:25:45,664
- Why are you here?
- We came to give 2.5 millions!

1186
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,001
Achutha Menon sir is wanted inside

1187
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,276
We will tell you
if any important news is there

1188
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:54,143
- We will meet you in your office
- Ok

1189
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:08,250
- Do you know what is news?
- No

1190
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:12,129
- Which 2.5 millions, he has come after?
- Those who came that day...

1191
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:16,135
Menon's sons whose house is to take away
by the blade company people

1192
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:19,263
To solve their problem,
the daughter in America

1193
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:21,535
...and the son who is the officer
in Delhi are been threatened

1194
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:24,339
...and got 2.5 millions! That is this!

1195
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:29,314
That 25 and this 25...!

1196
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:33,453
The daughter's husband means
Golden Papan's son

1197
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,250
l got it

1198
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:38,257
No! You haven't understood fully

1199
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:41,590
- What? - 2.5 millions which we
gave to Papan

1200
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:45,530
...comes back to our office with Menon sir!

1201
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:49,399
- My God!
- Take the bike

1202
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:10,220
When a necessity arose to Menon...
these people were not seen!

1203
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:11,425
They won't

1204
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:14,788
When the principle and
interest were not there

1205
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,523
...l know the agonies caused by that

1206
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:20,459
What the people say
the cruel work has made

1207
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:22,866
...the 2.5 millions reach here now

1208
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:28,806
Where were you all this time?

1209
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,878
l went to get back the car
given for service

1210
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:32,742
We have to reach up to Mercara, isn't it?

1211
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:38,451
25 in cash and a check for 50 millions
Both are before the Mother's statue

1212
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,111
Tell mom to give it to you

1213
01:27:40,488 --> 01:27:42,046
You know me well, isn't it?

1214
01:27:43,024 --> 01:27:47,324
Menon brought 2.5 millions
and closed the old account

1215
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:51,096
Hence l could give in cash
what that woman told

1216
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:55,299
You have to tell me
if you want to sell the house and land

1217
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:56,597
Aworthy party is there

1218
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:03,307
ls there any plan like that?
He is doing Real Estate business

1219
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:06,312
He is going now
There is a hotel for sale Mercara!

1220
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:09,382
lf you could give the document

1221
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:11,144
...and the other paper
which is written and signed

1222
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:12,616
...we could have left here

1223
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:14,687
They are ready

1224
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:19,483
This confusion was made by Nambiyar

1225
01:28:19,727 --> 01:28:21,957
Why did he tell it to you?

1226
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:24,491
Else you wouldn't have known this

1227
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:32,231
Madam should have called me
before giving out this money

1228
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:33,966
Forget it

1229
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:37,338
You are just repeating it and making him...

1230
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:44,142
l gave him that money
because his sight was a registered plan

1231
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:49,220
lf the sale was done through him
he should have got a big amount!

1232
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:55,055
So there is nothing wrong in it
What Jaya Prakash?

1233
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:59,963
You should beat me with chappals
instead of supporting like this

1234
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:04,628
Beena told it right
lt was a fraud work what we did

1235
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,167
That 25 lakh rupees
will be bought to you one day!

1236
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:11,438
l'll get a relief only then

1237
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:12,874
Everything will be right only then!

1238
01:29:14,382 --> 01:29:17,840
- lf we want to get a good life for us
that is needed - Go man

1239
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:21,988
l gave 2.5 millions to Jaya Prakash
without any difficulty

1240
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:24,149
There is no need to get emotional!

1241
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:29,386
You two get married and come to me

1242
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:33,958
Why do l need lot of money?

1243
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:35,625
There are no children for me to offer

1244
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:40,666
Whats' the use of having so much money
in this old age?

1245
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:42,376
What's it Nambiyar?

1246
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:44,875
Kuriakkose's son who has bought
the tea estate has come

1247
01:29:44,979 --> 01:29:46,139
Shall l call him?

1248
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:49,345
Nambiyar can see that

1249
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:53,246
lt is the first payment!
They want to give it to madam in person!

1250
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:58,250
- We take leave then!
- Sit, l will be back

1251
01:29:59,427 --> 01:30:00,519
Come

1252
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:05,423
- Greetings doctor
- Greetings

1253
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:07,228
2.5 millions in cash! And check for 50 millions!

1254
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:08,768
You wanted it like that

1255
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:14,832
l'll be back next week with dad
he wants to visit this place

1256
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,567
You can decide it with Nambiyar

1257
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:19,513
Ok, doctor

1258
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:48,607
Stop it somewhere and ask someone

1259
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:51,002
Let us go further away

1260
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:07,425
Stop here

1261
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:20,734
What is the crowd there?

1262
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:30,584
Move aside

1263
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:05,449
lt was a betrayal

1264
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:41,148
l have only seen things till now
which are not meant to see

1265
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:45,184
ln my life, l am forced to see...

1266
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:49,013
...the death of my wife and son
by committing suicide

1267
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:57,291
Enough, Jaya Prakash!
l am going

1268
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:01,497
l'll die somewhere on the road

1269
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:09,069
l don't believe any God
who can hearthe prayers!

1270
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:14,347
Hence, l could only give blessings
without any formalities

1271
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:17,551
Every thing will end up good

1272
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:24,490
lf there is a day like that
you should be with us to witness that

1273
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:29,821
lf the ship come to the shore by a storm
you should be inside it

1274
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,366
What is the use of it?

1275
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:35,159
All l have unlucky and cunning thoughts

1276
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:39,263
But lt'll be good
if l unite you together

1277
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:42,874
lf this man dreams of the millions
and fails to attain them

1278
01:34:42,977 --> 01:34:44,342
...we have to start a life!

1279
01:34:44,445 --> 01:34:47,505
l have to fight with the parents
and come out

1280
01:34:48,082 --> 01:34:51,711
We have only a few to depend on

1281
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,053
There is no need to think about that

1282
01:34:54,155 --> 01:34:59,752
We can share the feelings, good or bad

1283
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:05,828
l was looking for the land
for a wedding centre

1284
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:11,036
- Yes!
- Why don't we go for a lease agreement?

1285
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:15,174
l could only sell it

1286
01:35:15,276 --> 01:35:20,111
l was about to start a few projects...
l am not interested to sell this really

1287
01:35:20,214 --> 01:35:23,240
At this stage, it is difficult to hold it

1288
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:25,511
l was only asking it

1289
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:28,285
- You are telling it is 950 millions!
- Yes!

1290
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,186
- lsn't it negotiable?
- Yes

1291
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:32,350
We can have small adjustments, sir!

1292
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:36,720
The advance will be given in Trissoor
lt's a belief only

1293
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:38,458
You have to come home
and get it from mother's hands

1294
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:40,193
Why not? l'll come

1295
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:46,967
lt is Samy here
Hai! Raini

1296
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:50,844
lt is Rainikka

1297
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:53,175
l'm now here in your land, Kozhikode!

1298
01:35:53,948 --> 01:35:56,974
- What's up?
- The matter was almost fixed

1299
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:59,083
Then came a phone for Samy

1300
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,381
Our work will suffer, if it is Rainikka

1301
01:36:02,289 --> 01:36:04,450
The place is the best place!

1302
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:06,389
...and it is suitable
for the wedding centre

1303
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:11,398
ls it Jaya Prakash?
He is our dear

1304
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,859
Another problem in it are...

1305
01:36:13,968 --> 01:36:16,835
lf you ask me
no business will function these days...

1306
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:19,371
- What's it?
- l'll give it to Joy

1307
01:36:21,075 --> 01:36:23,066
- Greetings Samy!
- Hello Joy

1308
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:25,407
You are going to start
a new branch in Kozhikode, right?

1309
01:36:25,513 --> 01:36:27,344
ls the problem what Rainikka told?

1310
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:30,144
Rainikka and me have no belief in it

1311
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:31,980
But Samy has to see it

1312
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:34,714
You've some hold in that

1313
01:36:34,822 --> 01:36:38,189
As per Vaastu
there are a few problems there

1314
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:40,453
Don't get afraid of
any problems if you find

1315
01:36:40,561 --> 01:36:43,359
We will give you
the better property than this

1316
01:36:44,198 --> 01:36:46,894
Any way, we have to meet some time

1317
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:49,564
Will Rainikka give us problems?

1318
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:53,072
There will be worries we would flourish

1319
01:36:53,174 --> 01:36:58,339
One will worry only about other's gain
instead of his own loss

1320
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:02,347
So, shall l leave then?
l have to go to Thalipparambu!

1321
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:04,383
Haven't you heard about
Raja Rajeswari temple?

1322
01:37:04,485 --> 01:37:07,613
- l have heard about it many times!
- l take leave then!

1323
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,202
Protect Raini and Samy

1324
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:27,672
- We've to lose this one too, isn't it?
- Then what?

1325
01:37:29,276 --> 01:37:31,676
lf a Samy go off
another will come up

1326
01:37:55,903 --> 01:37:59,896
Eldose will be flat for 4-5 hours
if he gets drunk

1327
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:02,771
The vomit can't be left here like this

1328
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:05,243
Manappanchettan can move away
We will take care of this

1329
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:07,974
- CH is very good at this type of service
- ls it?

1330
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:10,812
Why do you give him drinks
if you know that he will vomit?

1331
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:12,408
He is innocent!

1332
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:15,613
l open his throat and force him to drink

1333
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,691
He don't like the smell of liquor

1334
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:20,157
Why do you force him to drink then?

1335
01:38:20,261 --> 01:38:22,855
He will sing a few poems
when he take liquor

1336
01:38:23,197 --> 01:38:25,188
My mother! Pardon me

1337
01:38:25,633 --> 01:38:29,569
This vain birth's dirty faces

1338
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:32,537
...are to be kissed on the
forehead and wake it up

1339
01:38:32,673 --> 01:38:37,736
We can forget a moment
the meaning of this vain birth

1340
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:39,972
l like these poems very much

1341
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,605
When hear it,
it sounds very amusing!

1342
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,475
Tell me about your plan!

1343
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:47,046
Brother! Let it be finished

1344
01:38:47,154 --> 01:38:48,644
This is usual thing
Tell me the matter

1345
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:52,590
- Our 21st is coming nearer!
- Let it be

1346
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:54,316
This is not any stray dog to scare about

1347
01:38:54,428 --> 01:38:55,588
lt's only a date

1348
01:38:55,763 --> 01:38:58,789
lt is not a stray dog
lt is a stray tiger!

1349
01:38:58,933 --> 01:39:01,094
Not many days! Only 10 days more

1350
01:39:04,405 --> 01:39:06,771
- lt would be very helpful!
- lt won't happen!

1351
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:10,502
As we expected, things didn't work out well

1352
01:39:10,744 --> 01:39:11,870
Do you want 2.5 millions?

1353
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,511
Do you want the advance back?

1354
01:39:17,584 --> 01:39:23,545
- No need - lf you won't give me
10 millions on 21st, forget 2.5 millions

1355
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,017
l'll find another party that day it self

1356
01:39:27,328 --> 01:39:30,229
We have just came in Papanchettan

CH! Then we will meet you on 21st

1358
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:36,961
- Can l see you then?

01:39:44,878 --> 01:39:46,971

1360
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:49,446
- He will have it
- Nasty guy

1361
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:58,418
We will come back to the things

1362
01:39:58,525 --> 01:40:02,188
Advocate and me are the representatives
of a Maharashtra based company!

1363
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:07,464
ln various majortowns in south
they buy or build shopping malls

1364
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:10,668
lf we buy for them property
for a reasonable price

1365
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:12,864
...we will get a good commission

1366
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:15,874
lf we get a green signal from Bombay
every thing will go on fast

1367
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:17,873
The company should know that
it is a genuine dealing

1368
01:40:17,978 --> 01:40:19,275
- That's all
- lt is

1369
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:23,280
You were with Raini and Joy Associates
for long, right?

1370
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:28,686
You mean Raini and Joy?
We have started at the same time!

1371
01:40:28,789 --> 01:40:32,782
My partner CH and me deal with high range
in estate

1372
01:40:32,893 --> 01:40:35,987
Rainikka is a dealer in
5 -10 cents in this town

1373
01:40:36,096 --> 01:40:38,860
How do you... Raini and Joy?

1374
01:40:39,233 --> 01:40:42,134
We study when we come to a place
about the market details

1375
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:45,330
along with the important
broker crocodiles there!

1376
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:48,000
Let it be
What is your demand?

1377
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:53,610
1 acre land,1 lakh sq.feet, 4 floors,
Parking for 100 cars!

1378
01:40:53,814 --> 01:40:55,714
950 millions... many have told

1379
01:40:55,816 --> 01:40:57,943
We will settle forthat money if we want!

1380
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:00,980
An E-Mail communication with the company!

1381
01:41:01,255 --> 01:41:04,122
The decision should come from there
We will wait for a day!

1382
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:08,761
lf it is completed, you just
have to tell what you want

1383
01:41:08,929 --> 01:41:10,726
- We will manage to give you
- You don't need to worry about that

1384
01:41:10,964 --> 01:41:12,192
Our company
will give us what we need

1385
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:16,034
- l take leave
- We will meet again tomorrow

1386
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:19,296
Mean time the matter will be settled
and we shall expect that

1387
01:41:19,473 --> 01:41:25,002
You have been really helpful!
Really we were in trouble

1388
01:41:25,312 --> 01:41:28,145
l invested whatever l had
in this business

1389
01:41:28,649 --> 01:41:30,207
l wish if it could be solved

1390
01:41:46,867 --> 01:41:49,165
- What did he tell before going?
- 950 millions

1391
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:51,897
He gave us an offerthat he would give
us a commission if the deal has clicked

1392
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:55,600
He can, if he gives 850 millions to Papan
he has a balance of 100 millions

1393
01:41:55,676 --> 01:41:57,234
How much the company
need to make it ready?

1394
01:41:57,845 --> 01:41:59,574
lt depends on the proposal we give

1395
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,113
1 billion, is good enough for it

1396
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:05,183
ls there anybody to backup Jaya Prakash
to help him financially?

1397
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:06,479
l don't think so

1398
01:42:06,753 --> 01:42:09,244
10 millions has to be given
to Papan in 3-4 days!

1399
01:42:09,356 --> 01:42:11,051
Else he'll lose the advance money 2.5 millions

1400
01:42:11,225 --> 01:42:13,557
He is playing a dangerous game

1401
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:16,686
Why don't we take him away
from this scene?

1402
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:18,964
We shall give a tip to him

1403
01:42:19,066 --> 01:42:21,557
lt is good for him!
He has a relative Surendran!

1404
01:42:21,668 --> 01:42:23,192
Let me talk to him

1405
01:42:24,571 --> 01:42:28,701
We should be able to play with Papan!
We can give 850 millions for Papan!

1406
01:42:29,209 --> 01:42:33,543
But, it is the work for Raini and Joy
to throw him out very smoothly

1407
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,205
- That work is ours!
- We can make it alright

1408
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:40,013
You will get an amount what we suggest

1409
01:42:42,089 --> 01:42:43,454
Can you say how much?

1410
01:42:43,557 --> 01:42:45,752
We would say it when it is time

1411
01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:57,303
lf Jaya Prakash get the merit of it
it is as good as my sons get the merit

1412
01:42:57,471 --> 01:43:00,599
This is only an emotional dialogue
Talk as the matter of fact

1413
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:05,134
Can Jaya Prakash raise 10 millions
to Papan at short notice?

1414
01:43:05,245 --> 01:43:06,041
l ask you that

1415
01:43:06,146 --> 01:43:09,343
lf no...it is 2.5 millions what gets lost

1416
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:11,017
Raini and me are worried that we couldn't

1417
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:13,552
...able to help him in a situation like this

1418
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:14,985
What do Surendrettan say?

1419
01:43:15,389 --> 01:43:18,847
l too want to help him
getting money from somewhere

1420
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:21,553
But l think that nothing
will work out well

1421
01:43:21,662 --> 01:43:23,289
We will ask Jaya Prakash about this

1422
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:30,261
- ls there any way to get 10 millions?
- l don't find any way out

1423
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:31,359
What shall we do then?

1424
01:43:31,572 --> 01:43:35,201
According to Papan, the token given
was swallowed

1425
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:38,468
Mahesh sir has come
as the company's official rep

1426
01:43:39,346 --> 01:43:44,545
We are ready to take up the deal giving
a gift or a certificate for Jaya Prakash!

1427
01:43:44,751 --> 01:43:47,345
lt means you'll get 2.5 millions in your hand

1428
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:50,623
- l think Surendran has heard it
- Prakash! lsn't it fair enough?

1429
01:43:50,724 --> 01:43:52,783
Prakash! Get it man

1430
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:55,987
lf you are intelligent
you could as well receive it

1431
01:43:56,096 --> 01:43:57,688
He is intelligent alright

1432
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:01,231
What? What you are going to
get is not a small amount

1433
01:44:01,335 --> 01:44:02,529
lt is 2.5 millions!

1434
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:06,732
lt is not 2.5 millions!
lt is an approximate figure that's all

1435
01:44:06,873 --> 01:44:09,068
No...We are ready to give that much!

1436
01:44:09,309 --> 01:44:11,675
Dear! Stretch your hand and get it

1437
01:44:14,181 --> 01:44:15,808
Why don't you talk anything?

1438
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:23,383
lf every body is willing to help and save us
l have nothing to say

1439
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:26,152
Sir! You can come up with the details

1440
01:44:26,326 --> 01:44:30,490
- You have made it!
- Then what?

1441
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:35,868
We eat biriyani and give
the bone to the dog

1442
01:44:35,969 --> 01:44:37,732
You say it is your time
seeing at its face

1443
01:44:37,838 --> 01:44:40,136
lt is such a nasty thing what you told now

1444
01:44:40,774 --> 01:44:45,905
For 850 millions from Papanchettan
to buy the shopping mall

1445
01:44:46,013 --> 01:44:47,844
You people came to us

1446
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:53,147
lnstead we didn't come
to anyone of you to save us

1447
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:56,813
lf we have to sell for 850 millions
what we have bought for 850 millions

1448
01:44:56,923 --> 01:44:59,255
...that will be done in a decent way

1449
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:03,955
Then we will be roaming in the market,
without money starving!

1450
01:45:04,164 --> 01:45:06,928
But even then l won't have
a guilty complex

1451
01:45:07,034 --> 01:45:08,968
...that the bone which you have
thrown to us is a loss

1452
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:11,867
l have no decent education for me

1453
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:15,304
l haven't studied the Corporate law
or business administration

1454
01:45:15,509 --> 01:45:17,238
But l know the market law
that what we bought for 10 rupees

1455
01:45:17,344 --> 01:45:19,972
...should be sold at 20 rupees!

1456
01:45:20,914 --> 01:45:23,644
We knew about one thing in this sitting

1457
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:26,980
We have people who need, from us...many

1458
01:45:28,288 --> 01:45:29,255
Ok then!

1459
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:39,098
Forget it if you can't help

1460
01:45:39,466 --> 01:45:42,264
lt is ok if you can't reach your hand
at the one who is in the pit

1461
01:45:42,536 --> 01:45:46,495
But don'tjoin those,
who put sand into the pit

1462
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:48,668
Come man

1463
01:46:17,337 --> 01:46:21,296
Will there be any news in the paper tomorrow
that 3 corpses were swept ashore?

1464
01:46:21,975 --> 01:46:24,136
l won't tell not to stab a corpse

1465
01:46:24,244 --> 01:46:26,610
l would tell not to stab, you corpse!

1466
01:46:28,248 --> 01:46:31,046
You have no money
and are cracking jokes!

1467
01:46:31,151 --> 01:46:33,984
Beena has come with a good news

1468
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:36,817
- What good news?
- l feel so

1469
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:41,051
When we are short of money
we feel so when we see Beena

1470
01:46:41,161 --> 01:46:42,719
Beena can make things happen!

1471
01:46:43,964 --> 01:46:46,455
Beena can make things happen even now!

1472
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:52,001
Come! Surendrettan is in the car

1473
01:46:52,773 --> 01:46:53,671
l won't come

1474
01:46:54,107 --> 01:46:55,665
Come!
Don't be adamant

1475
01:47:02,749 --> 01:47:03,681
That is...

1476
01:47:06,386 --> 01:47:08,354
Keep the phone down
Get in

1477
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:31,910
- What happened Prakash?
- Nothing

1478
01:47:32,345 --> 01:47:35,746
-Are you angry with me?
- For what?

1479
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:42,684
l wanted to discourage you
not because l envy you

1480
01:47:43,657 --> 01:47:47,093
lf anything good comes for you
l know well that, it is for hertoo

1481
01:47:48,695 --> 01:47:49,627
Forget it

1482
01:47:49,729 --> 01:47:51,560
l have 5 millions ready with me

1483
01:47:51,665 --> 01:47:53,895
You do what you like for the rest

1484
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:57,603
Take the bag on the back seat

1485
01:48:05,045 --> 01:48:07,240
Surettan l am...

1486
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:21,889
l feel as if l have swam half the sea!

1487
01:48:22,095 --> 01:48:25,394
The distance is half towards
the front and back

1488
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:26,659
l am towards the front

1489
01:48:26,766 --> 01:48:28,063
There is no doubt in that

1490
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:32,201
Today is 19 and the day after is 21

1491
01:48:32,973 --> 01:48:35,168
What if l go
and meet Papan again?

1492
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:39,604
5 millions in cash...
and 5 millions in lDlDl bank's check

1493
01:48:39,713 --> 01:48:43,945
- lt won't work
- My God! Release 5 millions more

1494
01:48:44,384 --> 01:48:47,911
...will come!
The way, this has come

1495
01:48:49,823 --> 01:48:51,654
When talking, if the mobile rings,
the Trivandrum girl

1496
01:48:51,758 --> 01:48:53,817
...will say it is TRUE!

1497
01:48:55,328 --> 01:48:58,161
Hello! Who is it?

1498
01:49:00,133 --> 01:49:03,500
...from where you are calling?
When did you reach?

1499
01:49:04,404 --> 01:49:08,101
l am in a serious problem here

1500
01:49:09,276 --> 01:49:10,300
l'll be coming

1501
01:49:11,011 --> 01:49:14,310
l will come
Bye

1502
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:17,847
- Who is it?
-Ashraf from Muscat!

1503
01:49:18,351 --> 01:49:23,812
He has enough money with him
want to see him?

1504
01:49:24,190 --> 01:49:27,318
He will come in Ashraf's disguise too!
Go and see him!

1505
01:49:28,161 --> 01:49:31,528
When the third too was a girl
my wife became serious!

1506
01:49:31,698 --> 01:49:33,825
She took up the finance
management herself

1507
01:49:33,934 --> 01:49:34,696
Her dad too was with her

1508
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:39,238
lf l get 10 Rs
he will take me to some land

1509
01:49:39,606 --> 01:49:43,337
Till the registration is over
it will be very tense afterwards

1510
01:49:43,443 --> 01:49:45,274
This time too, he has come to fix a deal

1511
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:48,538
Tell me some way out

1512
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:52,343
50 is with you...
and you need 50 too, right?

1513
01:49:52,652 --> 01:49:54,813
Yes! There is no time

1514
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:59,450
- Can you take a risk?
- l can take any risk

1515
01:49:59,559 --> 01:50:00,924
- Tell me
- lt is full risky thing!

1516
01:50:01,027 --> 01:50:04,463
l won't force you
You have to think and decide

1517
01:50:04,564 --> 01:50:06,361
Tell me the matter

1518
01:50:06,866 --> 01:50:08,356
lf you give 50, you will get 100

1519
01:50:08,468 --> 01:50:09,901
10 millions for 5 millions!

1520
01:50:15,308 --> 01:50:16,275
ls it black money?

1521
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:21,911
They won't catch you so easily

1522
01:50:22,349 --> 01:50:23,509
l have seen the lot

1523
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:24,982
l know the dealer too

1524
01:50:25,085 --> 01:50:27,918
But you have to think and do it

1525
01:50:28,488 --> 01:50:31,946
What does it mean that it won't
find it, who you are?

1526
01:50:32,058 --> 01:50:33,753
...even if it is in 2 looks!

1527
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:37,091
Do you know how many millions
are in Kerala?

1528
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:38,624
You can think about it

1529
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,360
l'll be here only

1530
01:50:41,534 --> 01:50:43,832
lf you are ready
l'll take you to the party

1531
01:50:50,543 --> 01:50:51,532
Making black money?

1532
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:53,272
Don't do that
lt will be problematic

1533
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:58,016
Think that there won't be any problem
and you go ahead!

1534
01:50:58,118 --> 01:50:59,676
This is not a child's play

1535
01:50:59,786 --> 01:51:05,053
This is cheating the country
But it is not started by us

1536
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:08,059
There are millions of rupees in this place

1537
01:51:08,161 --> 01:51:10,959
This is that money
going through our hands!

1538
01:51:11,064 --> 01:51:13,225
You or me might have touched it
without our knowledge

1539
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:15,824
...- many times!
- You are only arguing things

1540
01:51:15,935 --> 01:51:17,368
You know what the problems are!

1541
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:18,562
l know about the problems

1542
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:20,071
But there is no other go

1543
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:22,937
lt is just a wrong thing
to help out many souls!

1544
01:51:23,043 --> 01:51:24,135
l have decided to do it

1545
01:51:24,244 --> 01:51:25,802
Menon sir! He don't want to...

1546
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:29,404
l had been in the attire of Sakuni
who taught about gambling!

1547
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:34,582
Truth has no place in the game
which is played only to win!

1548
01:51:35,021 --> 01:51:37,512
But l'll suggest not to play this!

1549
01:51:40,493 --> 01:51:43,121
You have to imagine
what would be the result if get caught

1550
01:51:46,499 --> 01:51:49,468
lf get caught you would be
in jail for 7 years!

1551
01:51:51,738 --> 01:51:54,434
Don't tell me to give up
when l am half way through

1552
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:57,806
This time, l'm ready for this game
without you both

1553
01:51:57,911 --> 01:51:59,208
l'll come back only after l have won

1554
01:52:00,714 --> 01:52:03,308
- JP, you...
- There is no other solution for this!

1555
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:04,474
The vehicle has come

1556
01:52:06,252 --> 01:52:07,776
Take the box into the vehicle

1557
01:52:08,822 --> 01:52:12,588
- Shouldn't l come with you?
- No! You and sir can wait here

1558
01:52:15,695 --> 01:52:18,664
l'll be back in the late night
or in the dawn!

1559
01:52:18,765 --> 01:52:20,460
- You...
- You needn't tell anything!

1560
01:52:21,768 --> 01:52:26,796
Give your hands!
Place your hand

1561
01:53:04,144 --> 01:53:10,811
You invitee...is going back
like the sudden drizzle

1562
01:53:10,984 --> 01:53:14,317
Your aroma is like the kingly!

1563
01:53:14,454 --> 01:53:17,685
Will it fade off which is in the chest?

1564
01:53:17,857 --> 01:53:23,955
The invitee is going back!

1565
01:53:24,697 --> 01:53:31,296
You invitee as you have forgotten

1566
01:53:31,504 --> 01:53:34,837
The red is on your lip!

1567
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:38,204
lt is magic that it is there!

1568
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:43,780
You invitee is going back!

1569
01:54:11,177 --> 01:54:16,046
The blue window of my dream

1570
01:54:16,349 --> 01:54:19,682
The eyes of the imagination
are searching

1571
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:28,022
Your mind with the music has
come and filled in me

1572
01:54:28,328 --> 01:54:34,858
My mind with the music is knitting

1573
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:38,398
...new memories

1574
01:54:38,605 --> 01:54:47,035
The sweetness of the golden dream
has faded off from you

1575
01:54:47,247 --> 01:54:52,116
You invitee are going off

1576
01:54:57,457 --> 01:55:04,056
The past has given a few feathers

1577
01:55:04,364 --> 01:55:07,629
...which l have kept in my mind

1578
01:55:07,767 --> 01:55:10,895
The loveable and alone!

1579
01:55:11,137 --> 01:55:16,097
l have to go with a sorrowful mind

1580
01:55:16,442 --> 01:55:23,075
You invitee...is going back
like the sudden drizzle

1581
01:55:23,316 --> 01:55:26,717
Your aroma is like the kingly!

1582
01:55:26,853 --> 01:55:29,981
Will it fade off which is in the chest?

1583
01:55:30,223 --> 01:55:36,719
You invitee...is going back

1584
01:55:37,096 --> 01:55:41,863
The invitee is going back!

1585
01:55:42,235 --> 01:55:49,971
You invitee...is going back

1586
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:08,793
l went to sleep in the dawn only!

1587
01:56:15,935 --> 01:56:17,095
10 millions!

1588
01:56:22,475 --> 01:56:23,965
My God!

1589
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:30,681
You take it from the sack
and put it in the box

1590
01:56:30,783 --> 01:56:32,273
What is in the sack JP brother?

1591
01:56:32,785 --> 01:56:34,616
lt is halwa... the black halwa!

1592
01:56:34,721 --> 01:56:35,745
Black halwa?

1593
01:56:36,856 --> 01:56:39,552
You have to buy it from Delta
That is...

1594
01:56:40,393 --> 01:56:41,621
Oops! lt is cash!

1595
01:56:42,562 --> 01:56:47,397
- How much is it?
- 10 millions

1596
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:49,731
10 millions lndian Rupees!

1597
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:52,731
l don't care if l have to die

1598

But l have seen 10 millions now!

1599
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:33,140
- ls it 1 in this?
- Yes!

1600
01:57:41,421 --> 01:57:44,618
- l think it is not black money!
- lt is!

1601
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,593
Reserve Bank governor would believe it

1602
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:53,893
The currency wouldn't dare to come
to Papanchettan's house!

1603
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:06,273
- You don't have to count it
- l will!

1604
01:58:07,013 --> 01:58:07,911
Take this and go

1605
01:58:08,448 --> 01:58:12,384
- So, we take leave
- Wait

1606
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:19,253
My hands and legs are shivering!

1607
01:58:19,358 --> 01:58:20,518
l feel very chill!

1608
01:58:21,894 --> 01:58:23,725
You won't feel cold
if you are wet all over!

1609
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:27,864
- You got it?
- This is a rope bridge!

1610
01:58:27,967 --> 01:58:29,730
We can't be sure if one
could reach the other side

1611
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:37,436
lncluding the advance
money 12.5 millions

1612
01:58:37,543 --> 01:58:40,444
...is been received by me and
lf the matter is in your name

1613
01:58:40,546 --> 01:58:45,040
...or on the man's name told by you
l would register in 3 months!

1614
01:58:45,151 --> 01:58:46,448
lt is the agreement telling that

1615
01:58:51,858 --> 01:58:56,352
- Let me go!
- You are really smart!

1616
01:58:56,462 --> 01:58:57,690

1617
01:59:03,836 --> 01:59:09,866
- l'll call you if the amount is incorrect!
- Ok!

1618
01:59:26,359 --> 01:59:27,690
lt's Papanchettan!

1619
01:59:39,205 --> 01:59:40,229
Take it

1620
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:51,816
You don't make me a fool!

1621
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:58,423
- What is it?
- 1000 rupees is less in a bundle!

1622
02:00:02,395 --> 02:00:04,761
l counted it 2 times
but it is the same amount

1623
02:00:06,732 --> 02:00:11,192
ls it? Don't worry about it!

1624
02:00:12,438 --> 02:00:13,871
You have to remember it

1626
02:00:18,177 --> 02:00:22,477
- ls there any other problem?
- There is no other problem!

l mean if there is
any problem other than Rs 1000

02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:31,854
l think you have entered
a very lucky period!

1629
02:00:32,558 --> 02:00:36,153
- What is it chettan?
-A party has called me now from Gulf

1630
02:00:36,429 --> 02:00:38,192
They are still near the mall!

1631
02:00:38,297 --> 02:00:42,324
They seem to be the buyers,
in the way they talk!

1632
02:00:42,535 --> 02:00:45,504
Don't forget me
if you get a big profit

1633
02:00:45,605 --> 02:00:48,039
Don't give the commission to someone
You can give me

1634
02:00:48,474 --> 02:00:51,034
l will do that
Shall l cut the call?

1635
02:00:57,783 --> 02:01:01,742
Buyers waiting in the shopping mall
They are from Gulf

1636
02:01:01,854 --> 02:01:06,314
lf this deal is a success
l will be a big shot in this Kozhikode

1637
02:01:10,896 --> 02:01:12,363
Come, let's go

What is this?
Have you started to roam public?

02:03:35,374 --> 02:03:38,366
Parents have gone to Guruvayur
Do you know that?

1656
02:03:38,744 --> 02:03:41,440
Else you won't come
with her boldly

1658

There is some problem
You have to listen to me what l say

1764

Why did you ask for sack?

1765
02:15:02,427 --> 02:15:06,193
Keep this money in the sack,
tie up and keep it in the store room

1766
02:15:06,298 --> 02:15:07,526
Aren't you going to Lions meeting?

Hence l have to make ready
10 millions of original money

02:15:11,803 --> 02:15:13,100
Oh God!

1769
02:15:43,001 --> 02:15:46,960
Oh God! You didn't give me a clue
that he would cheat me

1770
02:16:11,096 --> 02:16:14,065
He gave me work
that l got 12.5 millions from him

- Did he pay you 10 millions?
- Yes he is right, and the money is here

1776
02:16:32,384 --> 02:16:34,284
lt is usual practice
changing fake notes here

1777
02:16:34,386 --> 02:16:38,015
No, for what reason
he gave 10 millions for you?

1778
02:16:38,123 --> 02:16:39,283
What is the connection between you both?

1779
02:16:39,391 --> 02:16:41,222
Didn't he tell you about shopping mall?

1780
02:16:41,326 --> 02:16:43,487
He gave the money as advance
forthe shopping which l sold him

1781
02:16:43,595 --> 02:16:46,291
No, l didn't pay the net cash

1782
02:16:46,398 --> 02:16:49,367
l have borrowed from others
and gave to him

1783
02:16:49,734 --> 02:16:51,292
- Did you call me?
- Yes

1784
02:16:51,403 --> 02:16:54,304
There is a case under my cot
in the bed room Bring that

1785
02:16:54,406 --> 02:16:55,304
Do you mean sack?

1786
02:16:55,407 --> 02:17:01,607
There is case under my cot in the bedroom

02:17:03,048 --> 02:17:05,175
l have counted it!
But there are 1000 rupees shortage in that

1788
02:17:05,283 --> 02:17:06,113
l have informed him

1789
02:17:06,284 --> 02:17:08,809

02:17:51,496 --> 02:17:54,294
Take your own time and check it
That is good for us

1793
02:17:54,399 --> 02:17:57,027
We can't find the difference
between original and duplicate

1794
02:17:57,135 --> 02:17:58,693
Sign and get the document

1795
02:17:58,803 --> 02:18:03,604
There is one more enquiry by enforcement
to prove this is original or not

1796
02:18:03,708 --> 02:18:05,733
You have to show the source
from where you got the money

You can take him out

1806
02:18:29,634 --> 02:18:31,659
Only if it is original,
you can move further

02:18:31,770 --> 02:18:33,863
l am sure that is original
There is no doubt in that

To love the wife more with guilty complex

1823
02:19:49,814 --> 02:19:54,148
...for having prostitutes
in the travel to sleep with!

1824
02:19:55,387 --> 02:19:59,949
These are the dreams of an average
educated Malayali youth

1825
02:20:00,058 --> 02:20:02,390
...which are mine too!

1826
02:20:02,827 --> 02:20:07,526
That becomes a fake note and ash
after getting burned

02:20:07,632 --> 02:20:11,762
My 10 millions is getting burned here

My father was a rubber tapping employee
and he worked very hard to bring me up

02:20:19,210 --> 02:20:24,409
Behind this luxury life of mine

Even if l loss Rs 10, l'll get upset

You deceived me Rs 10 millions

1832
02:20:43,234 --> 02:20:48,934
My dear Papanchetta!
You won't lose anything

1833
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:51,975

1834
02:20:52,243 --> 02:20:56,304
l wrote an agreement and gave you
that l was paid with 12.5 millions

1835
02:20:56,414 --> 02:20:58,541
10 millions from that are burning now

1836
02:21:06,624 --> 02:21:08,216

You've sold me this building
for Rs 850 millions

1841
02:21:32,717 --> 02:21:35,584
But l've sold it to Arumugan's son

Then the business will start
between you and Siddartha

You just give me 847.5 millions
You take the profits

1851
02:22:06,751 --> 02:22:08,275
No Papanchetta!

1852

l almost went nearjail doors
and came back

1853
02:22:12,824 --> 02:22:14,086
You saved me

He came to us from somewhere else

ln this strange life,
he entered as a page of book

1881
02:26:41,125 --> 02:26:43,150
...and left me by telling only the half part

1882
02:26:44,128 --> 02:26:46,358
He left his body and
continued the journey to somewhere

1883
02:26:54,972 --> 02:27:00,035
Why did Menon want to meet Jaya Prakash?

1884
02:27:01,078 --> 02:27:03,979
What he wanted to tell him?

1885
02:27:05,483 --> 02:27:08,384
How can Jaya Prakash know about it?

1886
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:11,582
Somebody should tell him about it

1887
02:27:17,228 --> 02:27:18,490

1894
02:27:41,853 --> 02:27:45,687
The dead Menon sir wrote this property
