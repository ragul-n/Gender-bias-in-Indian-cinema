(Cheering)

69
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,420
This may not be enough,
couple of more rounds of practice is needed

70
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,763
Just that, aren't they competing
for the first time..a kind of Preparation

71
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,964
It is the under 17 - South Zone Selection

72
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,693
Can see that fear on everyone's faces

73
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,799
(Don't worry they will surely win)

74
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,806
That aggressiveness of his...

76
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,081
but does lose control once in a while

77
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,247
Advise him when you go home

What bitterness?

130
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,160
Then why didn't you "Like" my photograph?

131
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,930
When did these "like" start!

132
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,398
But didn't our "likes"
start in our childhood, dude

133

What a pity!

188
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,357
Will she have this sprayed
on the entire Panchayath

189
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,817
Look, someone has come..
there is a bike,

190
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,429
Oh Father!

191
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,060
Hope you are fine

192
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,565
There she is again?

193
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,108
Oh Lord the powerful and omnipresent

194
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:02,246
(prayer continues)

195
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,071
Should it be opened!

196
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,179
Dude.. open

197
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:14,121
(In the background prayer continues)

198
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,384
It is the Cardinal

199
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,197
Com e, let's move

200
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:20,722
Cold Soda is best with this

201
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,567
I will come in the evening,
don't finish it off alone

202
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,803
(gesturing in frustration)

203
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,771
No, 
..

204
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,248
Oh was that you

205
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,289
I thought it was the sexton,
you scared me

206
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,154
What's this dad?
Isn't it time to stop?

207
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:50,885
This is regular business!

208
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,888
Last round it is

209
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,458
As if! Let mom not hearthat

210
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,691
(Sign language)

211
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,293
What are you saying, brother?

212
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,201
Why are you late today,
is what he is asking

213
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,907
Isn't it Election time,

214
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,106
Been busy running around
covering programmes

215
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,334
lam damn tired

216
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,806
I will move then, bye

217
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,585
Dude.. It is real stuff

218
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:21,816
Really good for a great sleep

219
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,218
How about one more peg?

220
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,259
No, I don't want

221
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,732
There your son is come..

222
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,333
Just a minute, I will be back now

223
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,243
What?

224
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,245
Rent!

225
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,280
Oh Rent amount!

226
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:47,676
Okay

227
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,282
Good night

228
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,248
He has left!

229
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,788
Can have four more rounds peacefully

230
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,285
Did you watch Messi's goal? Excellent

231
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:58,962
Come in

232
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,331
No, I am going

233
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,433
Had given my boot to him,
I came to collect that

234
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,230
- Like to have tea?
- No thanks

235
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:05,834
It's getting late

236
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,636
- Here
- Okay dude

237
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,238
What is tomorrow's programme?

238
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,735
Are you coming forthe match?

239
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:11,908
What about you?

240
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,839
I will be there

241
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,247
See you then..

242
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,356
(Got fever...)

243
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,831
Where is your shoe?

244
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:48,802
See!

245
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,309
Why didn't you tell me?

246
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,816
Doesn't matter, Dad, I will manage

247
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:07,023
Saajitha Dear...

248
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,491
Get that fish curry too

249
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,462
Shall I serve some chicken, son?

250
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,430
One piece

251
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,465
Mom, feed your son instead
of your son-in-law

252
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,640
What kind of talk is this!

253
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,701
My dear Sameer, had you informed your
coming, I would've cooked more dishes

254
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,641
Mom, there are already enough dishes

255
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:23,576
Are these not sufficient?

256
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,806
How many days are you here?

257
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,779
Eh.. howmuch ever days he stays,

258
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,648
we will not send you until we marry you off

259
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,455
In that case how about registering
in the matrimonial tomorrow itself

260
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,421
Is that needed? No need

261
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,654
Why? Is there any one in your mind?

262
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:42,665
You eat this fish

263
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,368
Mom is asking is there anyone in your mind

264
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,561
No..there is no one in my mind

265
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,908
Hmm..You are all the time in Facebook,
definitely there is someone

266
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,901
Isn't it?

267
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:52,966
Come on, all of you

268
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,812
Are you going to marry him
off tonight itself?

269
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,680
Let him eat peacefully

270
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:58,645
You eat

271
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,725
Why are you uncomfortable
about his getting married?

272
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,459
What discomfort?

273
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,495
Definitely his marriage
will take place this time

274
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:20,103
If you don't redeem my
ornaments you pledged

275
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:22,838
I won't step out into the
marriage venue, I warn you

276
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,867
Have you seen standard people?

277
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,978
They wearjust one chain,
one bangle and a pair of earrings

278
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,815
Getting decked with too much
of jewellery is local

279
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,650
Yeah

280
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,316
Ain't 
 your wife

281
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,621
Awife of a second hand bike dealer..

282
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:37,914
ls local..

283
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,824
Stop new excuses, and redeem
my ornaments at the earliest

284
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:41,859
Did you get that?

285
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,727
Smart!

286
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,865
Will not work!

287
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,803
- Can't you stay here, Pathu?
- Hmm.

288
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:54,095
Let her stay here then

289
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,497
She won't stay alone,

290
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,140
then you will have the trouble
of bringing her home at night

291
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,669
She will simply keep crying

292
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,535
Okay

293
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,841
Hubby, give me the keys

294
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,676
Put battery into it

295
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,580
Battery!

296
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,946
Sameer, come here

297
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,619
Bye aunty

298
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:12,812
Okay dear

299
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,559
Have you decided to get married?

300
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:21,456
Listen Sameeryou can buy a shirt and
give it off to someone if doesn't fit you

301
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:22,633
But Marriage is different

302
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,358
Even if it doesn't fit,
you will need to carry it with you

303
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,766
The present peace of mind also
would be lost. Hope you get me

304
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,801
For us, it's the Shirt and forthem,
it's Churidhar

305
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,945
And ifthe Churidhar doesn't fit them,
they still stitch it up and put it on

306
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,708
Doesn't matter, While buying a shirt,
take the one that fits perfectly

307
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,145
Then there won't be any problem

308
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,517
This Shirt looks fabulous!

309
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,711
Shall we leave

310
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,952
Good Selection! Did you buy for him?

311
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,456
Yeah I gifted for his birthday

312
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,058
Good one!

313
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,053
Correct Fit

314
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,857
-I will move then
- Okay

315
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,194
- Bye mom
- Bye

316
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:08,474
Come Mom

317
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:36,530
Sameer, you too were like Pathu then..

318
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,575
The proud gait with which you would walk out
saying
you were going to stay in great-Uncle's house

319
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:46,111
Then at night, you would start
crying to see your mom

320
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,816
And somehow reach back home

321
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:51,055
As a kid you wouldn't sleep
without seeing me

322
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,656
But now you don't have anything
like Mom needs to be seen, isn't it?

323
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:54,751
- I will do that..
- Let me..

324
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,755
Need not.. your hands will get dirty

325
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:56,858
Never mind

326
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,560
Oh Almighty..

327
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,723
Mom, at my work place

328
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,197
even ifthe Alarm keeps ringing

329
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,138
l neverwake up

330
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,838
lthink that you will
wake me up with a black tea

331
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,837
You are always with me, mom

332
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,981
Good proposals are coming for Suhra

333
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,107
But she wishes to study

334
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,146
Let her study, isn't she young?

335
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,852
Let her study how much ever she wants,
I will take care of her

336
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,686
This costs 130 Rs

337
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,690
If you are looking for the hybrid
Mango plant, it's on that corner

338
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,126
What are you looking for, Sir?

339
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,559
- Do you need any saplings?
-Yeah

340
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:08,890
What Saplings do you need?

341
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,262
Hmm..Yeah this will do

342
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,696
Which one do you prefer? Big or small?

343
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,306
- This one
- This one?

344
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:31,144
What happened?

345
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,847
Did you see her?

346
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,258
Only I saw, she didn't see me

347
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,057
Is this a scene in some movie!

348
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,788
It is the nth time!

349
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,296
No dude, wheneverl see her,
my hands and legs starttrembling

350
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,326
What's this?

351
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,964
Others shouldn't mistake us, isn't it?
Sol boughtthis

352
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,640
Couldn't you have bought some seed?

353
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,332
Was it necessary to buy this tree?

354
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:53,773
Come on sit

355
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:57,944
Sit

356
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,148
What kind of a man are you!

357
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,753
Good that you bought a guava sapling

358
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,723
Why?

359
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,888
When you go and see herthe next time

360
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,624
You can take guavas off
this for her children

361
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,166
Fantastic ones, that too!

362
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,996
What dude! I'm finding it
difficult to let her know

363
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:23,401
What the hell!

364
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,007
If you desire to marry her,
then talk to her dad

365
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,075
Her dad?

366
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,041
What nonsense are you talking?

367
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,144
Don't you rememberwhat happened last time?

368
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,714
We saw his dad thrashing
two fellows who were after her

369
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:33,713
Do you want us also to
be thrashed that way?

370
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,647
You are not going to profess love

371
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,412
You are asking his
daughter's hand for marriage

372
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:38,750
Won't that lead to trouble?

373
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,187
You just keep quiet,
I will go and talk to him

374
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,222
Just come along with me

375
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:43,058
Hope you don't mess it up

376
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,250
Nothing, You just come

377
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,002
This is his shop

378
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,065
This one?

379
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:53,928
Get down

380
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,334
Is this needed?
Can't we tell her directly?

381
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:57,673
Do you wish to marry her?

382
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:58,671
Then go

383
00:27:58,877 --> 00:27:59,809
l have slight fear

384
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,239
Hell with your fear

385
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,711
Like the fear before the exams, that kind

386
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,645
It will go off when the results come out

387
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,374
Walk.

388
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:08,816

00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:23,791

Do you recognize him?

398
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,022
Looks familiar but! don't recognize him

399
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,987
Our Mammooka's son, Sameer

00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,225
Aren't you in Gulf?

401
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,059

Hey, make it fast

411
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,488
Never attend to work

412
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,950
He has something to tell you

413
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:21,750
What is it?

414
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,426
Speak, dude

415
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,089
-l have a desire
-Okay

416
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,094
Not okay

00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,059
What the hell..Hey, hit hard

418
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,202
What the hell! You said you will speak

419
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,930
I love Zeenath since 5 years

420
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:38,838
Say again

421
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:42,501
Are you trying to cheat
dignified girls in guise of love?

422
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,279
No bro...

423
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,140
As he's not able to profess to her,
we approached you

424
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,282
Zeenath is unaware of his love

425
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,041
I don't go behind girls

426
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,380
What the hell are you doing?
Split that up

427
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,116
Run towards left...left

428
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,155
Have they gone?

429
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:06,064
Assume that student got Nipah infection
after eating guava bitten by bat

430
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,773
VorZ?

431
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:14,839
2005 Model?

432
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:15,808
Then must be V

433
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,274
It will cost around 4 to 4.25 lacs

434
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,075
You take a look, I will call you back

435
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,087
When did you reach?

436
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,122
Little while ago

437
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:42,198
Hey..

438
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:43,305
Stop

439
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,269
Come here

440
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:46,400
Who are we?

441
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,212
Ask him, Mom

442
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:54,875
What am 
 to ask?
Didn't he himself go and ask?

443
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:56,386
I will be back now

444
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,451
Hey..You sit down there

445
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,146
Sit down I say

446
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,054
Havel seen her?

447
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:12,961
Yeah Mom, you have seen her

448
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,562
She is here only

449
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:15,371
Where?

450
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,132
Come, I will showyou

451
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:20,544
Get up and come

452
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,039
How come I didn't see then?

453
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,109
Hold this, dear

454
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:24,974
Carefully

455
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,608
Where is it?

456
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:27,576
Here she is!

457
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,854
She studied along with me in School

458
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,923
The one on other side ofthe man
in blue shirt, is Zeenath

459
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,918
Oh I see

460
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:40,461
Was it to see her you were hanging around?

461
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,363
You thief!

462
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,232
Went alone seeking her hand!
Shameless fellow!

463
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,873
Look he is giggling!

464
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,373
What is to be done with this sapling?
Got to plant it or

465
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,177
Tell us and go

466
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,087
Look at his walk!

467
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,234
Sameer..

468
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:19,459
Ya..

469
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:21,970
Sit..Sit..

470
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,167
Hassan had come home

471
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:31,647
If his daughter is interested,
then he has no other view

472
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,540
And moreoverwe have no issues

473
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,447
Since you met herdad,
meet up with hertoo

474
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,159
Today's children... nothing can be certain

475
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,326
Requires real hardwork,
to make this the way it is

476
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:27,297
Definitely! Our back will break

477
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,040
Brother, tomato plants
do not seem to be manured

478
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:32,708
Would you check that out?

479
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:33,668
Tomatoes, right?

480
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,276
-You met dad yesterday, didn't you?
-Yeah

481
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,177
I think your dad got scared

482
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,016
True it was dad who got scared!

483
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:49,056
Yeah, I too got little scared

484
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,230
Why did you talk to
my dad instead talking to me?

485
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:58,064
I did come to tell you earlier,
but you were in 10th grade

486
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,031
Me?

487
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,130
So I thought of telling
you after returning from Gulf

488
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,275
Moreover my hands and legs were trembling,

489
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:06,306
When I was informing

490
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,207
And knowing this,
what could be your reaction,

491
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,109
when my parents wanted me to find out,

492
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:14,341
So to know your response also,
like what it would be earlier

493
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,552
And how would it be now

494
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:19,086
To inform at home.. an answer..

495
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,348
I am not getting any clue

496
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,053
Oh my god! My lady's finger

497
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,655
What is this?

498
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:29,094
-Won't it do if! buy this?
-What?

499
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,400
How much does this cost?

500
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,073
"Wheneverl see you"

501
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,336
"le heart throbs"

502
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,739
"le lips tremble always"

503
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,342
"To talk to you"

504
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,213
"But when! come near"

505
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,650
"The frightened words"

506
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:57,385
"Run away to hide"

507
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:15,307
"l sprouted roots
on the path you walk"

508
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,070
"I didn't give you a letter"

509
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,546
"Because I didn't want
to burn both houses"

510
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,552
"I burned myself"

511
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:26,552
"Whenl became almost mad"

512
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:35,358
"You made me a Sultan
by giving the sherbet of consent"

513
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:37,734
"Wheneverl see you"

514
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,266
"le heart throbs"

515
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,732
"le lips tremble always"

516
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,372
"To talk to you"

517
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:12,702
"I will smear you with Arabian scent
which! kept safe"

518
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:17,831
"We will go to the "Kaanjiramattam"
festival holding hands"

519
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:21,508
"l have seen a lot of dreams"

520
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,612
"When the day waits for me,

 feel that"

521
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,340
"The time which moves like a snail"

522
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,347
"Will increase its speed a little"

523
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:33,317
"Girl, to join you"

524
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,652
"Wheneverl see you"

525
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,155
"le heart throbs"

526
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,555
"le lips tremble always"

527
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,754
"To talk to you"

00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,236
"But when! come near"

529
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:48,462
"The frightened words"

530
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,730
"Run away to hide"

531
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,374
"Come with me"

532
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,269
"Run away to hide"

533
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,739
Select one more also

534
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,757
Here is some cash

535
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,789
As the marriage is nearing,
redeem her ornaments

536
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,256
Otherwise she will get worried

537
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,258
Sameer... It is enough to have
supported sister and her husband

538
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,659
You are going to become a family man

539
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,266
You will have more expenses

540
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,401
You keep this, I will redeem her ornaments

541
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:22,963
Okay

542
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,340
This is the best, shall I fix this?

543
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,203
Hmm

544
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:46,954
Sir, Eldo

545
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,491
Eldo is overthere

546
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,566
Your neighbor had just called

547
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:00,310
Your child is ill and taken to hospital

548
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:01,971
- (Daug hter?)
- Yes, daughter

549
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,005
Nothing to worry

550
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,712
You got to reach quickly

551
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,038
Ya...

552
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:21,855
Over there

553
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,930
When she was taken to the clinic nearby

554
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,998
Doctor advised to urgently
consult the Pediatrician here

555
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,360
A small infection.

556
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:29,765
Pneumonia is what is being told

557
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:30,831
Come

558
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:47,924

559
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:53,855
It is Tressa's dad

560
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,761
Asks whether he could see the child?

561
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,058
No, Not now

562
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:58,957
You can see the child later

563
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,314
Haven't you been allowing it
to be carried for sometime?

564
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,076
There is too much infection in the chest

565
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,816
That is why I moved her to ICU

566
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,078
Let her continue there for two days,
then I will tell you

567
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,990
(I will stay here)

568
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,597
(No, son will be back home)

569
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,368
Do I need to stay here?

570
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,829
(No, I will stay here)

571
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:37,773
Com e, let's move

572
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:38,634
Okay

573
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:39,741
We shall move, then

574
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,447
(Child..l will call you)

575
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,136
(Is it not connecting?)

576
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,005
Yeah, its connecting

577
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:17,409
Dad!

578
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:18,713
How is she, dad?

579
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,611
How is she?

580
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,051
In ICU

581
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,020
(You saw her?)

582
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,783
(Yes, she was sleeping)

583
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:29,982
Sleeping

584
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,456
Dad, do I need to come over there?

585
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:32,993
Do I need to come?

586
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,791
(No need..When is the match)

587
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,865
Match? That's on Friday

588
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:38,997
(Oh Friday, You needn't
come and the shoes?)

589
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:44,469
Oh shoes!

590
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:45,600
Not an issue

591
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,402
I will manage from my friend

592
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,636

593
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,678
Oh you will buy

594
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:52,507

595
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,541
Okay, Good night

It's not our fault

605
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,560
Didn't you run the bike over a disabled?

606
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:11,795

607

Come on, Wake up

742
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,586
There was a call from hospital

743
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,486
Saying you kid is been discharged

744
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:58,418
Try to reach quickly

745
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:00,388
Okay

746
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,076
Aren't you coming?

747
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,249
I will come later

748
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,582
Okay

749
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,352
Okay go carefully

750
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,779
Here he is! The other case

751
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:00,514
Are you from this locality?

752
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,725
-What?
- Do you hail from this place?

753
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:03,788
Yeah

754
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,525
I came to knowfrom my friends

755
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,569
What...

756
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:15,734
Take a look..

757
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,836
The man is sloshed out...

758
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,470
What a comedy!

759
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,046
What is wrong with him?

760
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,078
What is it, dude?

761
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,650
He is crossing limits! Look

762
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:46,127
Hey no..

763
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,598
Are you using my Dad to troll?

764
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,133
Hey no.

765
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:54,775
Hey You, I will smash your face,
You swine

766
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,737
Hey, what are you guys up to?

767
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,081
How dare you!

768
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,213
Hey stay apart

769
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,413
Hey.. separate them

770
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,777
You! Is it your mates on
whom to vent your anger!

771
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:05,884
Sir, Ask him..

772
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,120
He is the one who picked on me

773
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,719
He ridiculed my dad

774
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:09,722
Have a look at this, Sir

775
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:10,723
Everybody has got this

776
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:11,588
Hope you get me, sir

777
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,126
I didn't create this

778
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:14,357
Leave

779
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:15,722
Stop screaming

780
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,127
Have a look, Sir

781
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,833
It's already viral, Sir

782
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,539
What the hell is this?
Why are you picking on him?

783
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,834
It is your dad that you should
be asking about it

784
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,206
Share it in all groups

785
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,416
Let him show his frustration on his dad!

786
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,485
Can't all of you go home!
Enough of watching

787
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,146
What lack of awareness have you shown!

788
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,746
While travelling in the train
shouldn't you have been little careful?

789
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,781
Quite shameful, Eldo..

790
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,284
Mom, keep quiet

791
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:22,629
(That's why I dozed off
in the train unknowingly)

792
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:27,831
(Do you believe that 
 drink?)

793
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,263
If one looks at the way you are lying

794
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,175
Would anyone believe that you were sober?

795
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,436
(l swearon my child, I didn't drink)

796
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:43,610
Your son has come

797
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,253
Get in.

798
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:55,663
Lets move! Come

799
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,263
What are you standing to watch?

800
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:58,497
Can't you go home

801
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:16,477
(You)

802
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:18,384
Why do! need boots?

803
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:19,520
Where do 
 play?

804
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,515
I am thrown out from the team

805
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:23,550
(For what?)

806
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:24,851
You are the cause

807
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:18,513
(The message that went
viral me lying drunk)

808
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,940
(I swear I was not drunk)

809
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,009
(Even my son believed it)

810
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:25,516
(What will i do?)

811
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:43,299
(People will say lot ofthings)

812
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,304
(Butl am clear)

813
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:53,572
(Don't feel hurt)

814
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,307
(It's okay)

815
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:11,898
Eldo, what stupid thing have you done?

816
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,969
Moreover you are working
in a reputed school

817
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,805
(I swear I was not drunk)

818
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,840
What is the point of telling all this noVif?

819
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,409
People are laughing

820
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:23,670
It's a shame to this school

821
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,677
Manager has been calling me

822
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,711
Please stay away until
some decision is taken

823
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,817
(Madam...how do 
 make ends meet..)

824
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,013
I can't give any assurance about yourjob

825
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,823
Particularly in such a case

826
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:38,984
You can go

827
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:45,831

How can association request them
to take you back in yourjob?

00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:41,121
On what grounds can association involve?

844
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,683
Isn't it a Private school,

845
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,688
Keeping mum is sensible

846
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,691

933
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,453
All of you... don't forget the marriage date

934
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:22,151
No, we won't forget

935
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,823
Not only for the marriage,
please do come the previous day also

936
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:26,824
The previous day..

937
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,159
Definitely

938
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:29,895
Okay

939
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,104
Shall we move?

940
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:46,972
Come

941
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,596
Won't it be enough if you attend
the Parents meeting, dear?

942
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:43,997
Walk in

943
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:44,932
Sir

944
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:47,407
I will call you back, dear

945
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:48,667
He is the man..

946
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:50,675
This is that autorickshaw driver

947
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,513
Sir, he drives really carelessly

948
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:59,587
Moreover the vehicle
takes children to school

949
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:00,646
Look at this...

950
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,587
Neither has he a uniform

951
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,984
What is your name?

952
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:06,687
-What?
- Baiju!

953
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:09,556
What is your problem noVif?

954
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,064
Nothing

955
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:15,061
But then the complaint is that
you over speed with the children

956
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,972
l have no time for anything, that's why

957
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:20,702
Is that the reason for not wearing uniform?

958
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,375
ljust have one,
and it is put in forwash

959
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,307
I think of buying another one

960
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,675
But by dusk, money takes different routes

961
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,006
Expenses.. Sir..

962
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,144
Oh, so that is the problem

963
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:35,314
So the expenses in the evening
is your problem

964
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,656
Here take this 500 bucks

965
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:40,621
Go and get a full set uniform

966
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:43,265
Oh no, Sir, I will manage

967
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:44,455
No, you take this and buy one

968
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,725
No Sir

969
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,069
Just take it as a loan

970
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,430
Return it when you can afford

971
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,998
In that case shall I move?

972
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:55,072
Hey Baiju

973
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,975
You didn't tell me
when you would return it

974
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,477
As soon as he got it, he left

975
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,706
lsn't he in a hurry, man

976
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,516
I will return it after two days,
is that enough?

977
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,249
Hey, I am not in that much need

978
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,012
Return leisurely

979
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:08,688
Won't you have one rupee coin?

980
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,287
- One Rupee
-Yes.

981
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:12,427
Daily bring it here and give

982
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:13,458
In this Sir's hands

983
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,329
Satheesh, one rupee daily from him
for 500 days

984
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,023
500 days?

985
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:19,733
Come here

986
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:23,770
Don't fail!

987
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:27,572
So then leave..

988
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:30,804
Isn't he in a hurry?

989
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:39,651
You get inside

990
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:41,014
Please

991
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:54,094
What is the matter?

992
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:58,798
Complaint

993
01:07:59,208 --> 01:07:59,697
Please be seated

994
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:06,076
I had seen this

995
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:07,447
in the newspaper

996
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,442
That drinking case in the Metro!

997
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:14,449
In the present scenario,

998
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:17,524
everyone is aware of being caught
ifthey do such mischief

999
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,157
Yet see his audacity

1000
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:21,824
You don't drink, don't you?

1001
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:24,292
No, is it?

1002
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,859
Okay, we shall look into this

1003
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:29,430
You must catch him

1004
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:33,801
Who is this?

1005
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:37,677
- (My son)
- Oh Son!

1006
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:39,838
Don't worry, I will look into this,

1007
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:41,581
Go peacefully

1008
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:46,882
Good, I like it

1009
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,452
You have been playing games
since a long time

1010
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,285
How is this? Do you like it?

1011
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:51,858
Yes

1012
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,895
Isn't that orange better?

1013
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,466
No, this suits herwell

1014
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,566
Even otherwise he won't like all this

1015
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,104
Butl liked that orange,
Isn't that a good colour?

1016
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,636
Didn'tyou like? I liked it

1017
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:08,174
You mischief!

1018
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:11,869
Calling me You! Call me Sister

1019
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,303
Come on!

1020
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:19,719
Sameer, you better leave, we'll select

1021
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:21,513
Otherwise we won't be able
to buy what she likes

1022
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,354
Dear, take him somewhere

1023
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,289
Com e, let's have tea

1024
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:29,862
Being women, they will not be done
till the shop closes!

1025
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:30,798
Dear, you stay here

1026
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:31,929
Give me the mobile

1027
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:33,467
What's there to watch?

1028
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:34,829
Won't he have a desire?

1029
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,305
That's all after marriage, okay

1030
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:38,832
Only that much

1031
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:42,443
We just saw the experience
of a differently abled person named Eldo

1032
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:45,442
Who has been a victim
of the attack on Social Media

1033
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,444
Remember such a thing is done
to an speech challenged man!

1034
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:50,277
Without any mercy this brutal attack
was let loose on social media

1035
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:53,683
So do you intend to deal with this legally?

1036
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:56,881
Whoever it be,
if one amongst us is victimised,

1037
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,850
We will definitely bring him beforethe law

1038
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,507
Hello bro, my fare

1039
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:20,345
-What's it?
- Come here

1040
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:25,315
What's it?

1041
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:32,891
Don't you have sense, Sameer?

1042
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,954
How can you post a stranger's photo?

1043
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,864
Couldn't you have a thought and acted?

1044
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:37,765
Shucks!

1045
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,359
What to do? I made a mistake

1046
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,628
What mistake! You create trouble and come

1047
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:44,636
Your Goddam this way Selfie..
that way Selfie

1048
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,297
You playing with your mobile

1049
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:47,702
Had me guess that
you will be up to some mischief

1050
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,871
Seeing the way he was lying,
just for a comedy, 
..

1051
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,407
Clicked his photograph

1052
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,882
But I really, I swear,
didn't knowthat he couldn't speak

1053
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,388
What? He can't speak?

1054
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,880
You will be cursed, my friend!

1055
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:06,458
Isn't it my marriage

1056
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:07,787
I am totally tensed

1057
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,021
What will I do if police catches me

1058
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,694
You don't get tensed

1059
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,335
It's not only you who forwarded this

1060
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:16,697
Others must have also fonNarded it

1061
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:18,634
In that case they got to arrest everyone
and putthem injail?

1062
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,331
Then Jail will be ovenNhelmed

1063
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,643
But wasn't it I
who clicked that photograph first

1064
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,335
No..Don't worry, we will enquire

1065
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:25,444
Attend the call

1066
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:26,845
It's from her

1067
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:31,978
Hello dear

1068
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:35,656
Where are you?

1069
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,655
lam little busy, I will call you back

1070
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:38,723
Do call me back

1071
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:39,588
Okay

1072
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,307
Dear, accept..

1073
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:58,480
Isn't that this?

1074
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:01,411
Not this, dear,
I had sent it on whatsapp

1075
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,346
It was a photograph where the
leg is visible

1076
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:05,382
Isn't this the photograph
where the leg is visible?

1077
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:06,884
Where is it?
Where is the leg in this?

1078
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,687
Wasn't it in the photo
sent in the Whatsapp?

1079
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:09,824
Did you sent to me?

1080
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:11,492
Look, this is different one

1081
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:12,956
There brother is back

1082
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:13,690
Come here

1083
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:16,797
Total confusion about purchase of the cot

1084
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:20,564
Which one did you like amongst this?

1085
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:24,839
l and Sura selected the
cot in this photograph

1086
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:26,405
But he has bought a different one

1087
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:27,734
He is not accepting

1088
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,545
This is good!

1089
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:31,871
Oh! Now he turns the tables!

1090
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,511
This is our gift

1091
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,412
If you get excitement in
we can make this into a family cot

1092
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:44,686
I think he doesn't like it

1093
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:45,724
No, nothing of that kind..

1094
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:46,792
He must be feeling shy

1095
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:47,962
As if.. shy...

1096
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,591
Look at the way he left... he didn't like it

1097
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,859
You feel so,
I don't think he will have any problem

1098
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,593
Sura, go and sleep, It's getting too late

1099
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,604
Go and sleep, Pathu must have slept

1100
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:48,922
You stay here,
I will go and enquire

1101
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:09,511
Excuse me Sir

1102
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:10,903
One minute

1103
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:12,547
The time ain't right!

1104
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,445
Ah! How did he cometo knoVif?

1105
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,217
Come.. Sit

1106
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,551
Please tell, what is the case about?

1107
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:29,561
- Not a case...
-Ah..

1108
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,160

 just came to clear a doubt

1109
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:32,227
What doubt?

1110
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,496
Do you take up cases
relating to mobile phones?

1111
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:38,502
Yes of course! That is the trend now

1112
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,742
Troubling women by giving missed calls

1113
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:42,672
Exploitation through phone

1114
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:43,504
Me too

1115
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:46,806
I take up any dirty case
and free them with real ease

1116
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:47,879
Are you the accused?

1117
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:49,741
- Oh no..
- Even if it's you, not an issue

1118
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:51,212
Please tell

1119
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:56,451
Clicking someone's photograph.
posting in whatsapp and facebook

1120
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,684
And mildly slandering him,
would that become a case?

1121
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,153
Whether it be mildly or seriously,

1122
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:05,523
According lT ACT 66 A

1123
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:08,998
Leave that, lPC Section 499/500

1124
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:11,169
Defamation.. that is damaging reputation

1125
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,940
Then there are sections in
Kerala Police Act too

1126
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:17,042
Minimum 2 years of imprisonment
and 2 lacs rupees fine

1127
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,507
In case the Plaintiff's lawyer
were to be an intelligent one,

1128
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:23,515
Then the demanded compensation will
need to be paid too

1129
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:26,776
Said in short,

1130
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:31,619
Aselfie is sufficient to destroy
the peaceful existence of a family

1131
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:33,695
Hasn't the case been filed?

1132
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,159
Get the FIR details

1133
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:35,996
Which Station?

1134
01:15:36,265 --> 01:15:36,959
Hello

1135
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:38,733
No Station, Sir

1136
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:41,164

 just came to clear my doubt

1137
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:46,170
Ridiculous!
Now may I ask you a doubt?

1138
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:49,509
Do you hold on to any cash
as you are clearing your doubts?

1139
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:50,670
No

1140
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:57,243
What did he say?

1141
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,282
Eh..what!

1142
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:00,519
No issues?

1143
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:03,247
It is not coming

1144
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:04,987
Dude Police

1145
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:05,953
Police...

1146
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:07,955
Police!!

1147
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:09,286
Did they go?

1148
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,529
Listen, if you showthis fear of police

1149
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:15,168
they will catch for no reason
and flog you nicely

1150
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:16,070
Got it?

1151
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:18,629
What did that advocate say?

1152
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:24,772
Dude! Matter is simple

1153
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,171
Haven't you deleted it?

1154
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:27,245
Then what is the issue!

1155
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:27,945
No problem

1156
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:29,183
Yeah there is no problem

1157

1158
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:01,348
All of you look here

1159
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:14,193
I will get the sweet porridge..

1160
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:15,192
Dad.. here is the cake..

1161
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:17,194
Just a small piece for me

1162
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,222
Give him...

1163
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:22,632
What is it?

1164
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,935
My friend, Ananthu, got selection
in South zone

1165
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,400
Doesn't matter, try next time

1166
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:38,786

1167
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,888
His friend got selection in South zone

1168
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,317
He could be upset may be...

1169
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,249
Come..

1170
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,722
The efforts he put through
those guys need not know!

1171
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:54,426
What happened to the case?

1172
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,031
Leave it

1173
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:58,063
If such people are allowed to go free

1174
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:00,638
they will sit on the
heads of innocent people

Okay carry on

Is everything okay?
Or is there any problem?

1194
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:14,743
Everything is okay

Serve quickly

1200
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,399
Hey llyias! When did you arrive?

1201
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:33,394
Yesterday.

1202
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:34,963
But he didn't tell me

1203
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:36,794
I thought of giving you a surprise

1204
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:37,904
Surprise!

1205
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,743
- Come with me
- Let him eat

1206
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:54,421
Understanding the seriousness of the issue,
I couldn't sit there

1207
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,848
That is why I came rushing

1208
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,058
You know onething

1209
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,757
lam the admin ofthe group
and he was the one who took the photograph

1210
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,792
Oh you were the Admin! Fantastic!

1211
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:02,486
Nothing to worry

1212
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:04,025
What nonsense are you talking?

1213
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:06,266
If people at home come to know,
it will be big trouble

1214
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,494
l knowthe seriousness of the issue,

 deliberately avoided telling him

1215
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,036
Did you see Binish?

1216
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:13,899
There they are!

1217
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:19,580
- Wanted to know what can be done
- So..

1218
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,008
The other day we went to meet a lawyer

1219
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:24,978
Seeing his tension,
I made him seat in the car and

1220
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:26,811
I went alone to meet the advocate

1221
01:20:26,988 --> 01:20:27,977
Do you know what the lawyer said?

1222
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:31,225
Minimum 2 years of Imprisonment,
two lacs rupees fine for sure

1223
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:32,552
Oh my God!

1224
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:34,789
Hey Sameer!

1225
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:35,792
When did he come here?

1226
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:36,793
Hey dude!

1227
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,592
Sameer, get up

1228
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:40,434
You get the vehicle

1229
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:41,897
Don't scream and gather crowd

1230
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:43,396
Hey Sameer!

1231
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:44,537
Hey bring the vehicle

1232
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:54,547
B.P is quite high

1233
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:57,076
- Do you have head ache?
-Yes

1234
01:20:58,954 --> 01:20:59,318
Do one thing

1235
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:00,486
Let him get admitted here today

1236
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,221
And leave tomorrow after all the
check ups are done

1237
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:04,119
Oh no, Doctor, tomorrow is his marriage

1238
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:06,424
Not for nothing the B P rose

1239
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:09,828
Now don't get tensed because
the B.P is high

1240
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:11,026
It will get okay

1241
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:12,391
l have prescribed an injection

1242
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:13,829
There will be a little sedation

1243
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,229
Will be fine once he waken up
after a sleep

1244
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:16,404
Nothing to worry, okay

1245
01:21:16,638 --> 01:21:19,004
Will he wake up before the wedding time?

1246
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:23,935
Injection is better

1247
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:25,644
If it is the other one, you will doze off

1248
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:26,945
The tablet

1249
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:30,483
Brother Nasser is calling

1250
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:31,442
Has he come to knoVif?

1251
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,119
Hello

1252
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,081
Where are you?

1253
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:37,589
We are in the Beauty parlour

1254
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,386
Why didn't you tell me?

1255
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,118
If you had told, I too would have joined

1256
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:42,919
Sajitha too had wished to go

1257
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:44,928
The idea came up all of a sudden..
So couldn't inform

1258
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,995
Okay, come quickly,
all are enquiring for him

1259
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:49,964
He is doing facial

1260
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,497

1261

Facial!!

1263
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:02,439
No pain, is it?
Are you okay?

1264
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:09,319
Dude! I am thinking of
cancelling this marriage

1265
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,115
What stupidity are you talking?

1266
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:14,223
If you cancel the marriage
on your wedding day

1267
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:15,520
What will happen to that girl's future?

1268
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,426
Don't you know Hassan lkka?

1269
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:19,498
He's an iron cutter!

1270
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:23,229
No dude, even if police catches me
after marriage,

1271
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,063
Wouldn't that be a problem too?

1272
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:25,066
Then..

1273
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:26,898
Stay calm, We are there by you

1274
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:27,665
Don't speak..

1275
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:30,341
One fortaking photographs
and other one for sharing to all

1276
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,308
You know! didn't sleep for last two days

1277
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:33,981
I have lost 4 kgs

1278
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:38,685
Please don't have foolish thoughts
and mess up tomorrow's marriage

1279
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:40,682
Please advise him

1280
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:41,948

Everything is okay

1282
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:44,352
I am in a big tension

1283
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:45,491
Okay then take rest here

1284

01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:41,966
Stop there...
Hey..

1467
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,108
Crowd is gathering

1468
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:45,402
Come on sit, don't go

1469
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:46,872
-You will get into trouble
- Shouldn't we check

1470
01:34:47,048 --> 01:34:48,072
Come on sit

1471
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:50,809
Come fast...

1472
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:52,282
Get a vehicle

1473
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:54,086
We will check at their home..

1474
01:34:55,222 --> 01:34:55,950
Hold him

1475
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:57,449
Carefully...
Leg...

1476
01:34:57,858 --> 01:34:58,119
Hello

1477
01:34:58,426 --> 01:35:00,121
Take care of the vehicle

1478
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,845
Dear what happened?

1479
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:24,950
Nothing

1480
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:26,975
Are you not well?

1481
01:35:27,188 --> 01:35:28,746
- Nothing
- Do you have temperature?

1482
01:35:28,989 --> 01:35:30,923
Nothing

1483
01:35:31,759 --> 01:35:32,350
You sleep

1484
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:33,891
You sleep

1485
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:02,513
-Give it to me, mom, I will do
- No, dear

1486
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:04,380
It's okay, mom, You go and sit there

1487
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:10,825
Mom,

1488
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:15,393
Please don't feel offended if
I ask you something

1489
01:36:16,036 --> 01:36:17,196
What's it, dear?

1490
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:24,533
Is anything wrong with my husband?

1491
01:36:33,254 --> 01:36:34,016
Dear,

1492
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:37,549
As she is a decent girl,
she asked me openly

1493
01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:41,122
Suppose she had informed herfamily,
just think what would have happened

1494
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:43,157
Marriage has just got over

1495
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:45,989
Newly wed couples, isn't it?
Little tension will be there

1496
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,863
What tension does your son has when
the girl does not have?

1497
01:36:50,538 --> 01:36:53,336
Did you have any tension
when you married me?

1498
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:54,365
No, isn't it?

1499
01:36:55,943 --> 01:36:57,843
Go and ask him, dear

1500
01:36:58,212 --> 01:37:00,908
How can I discuss this looking at his face?

1501
01:37:01,081 --> 01:37:01,843
You go and ask

1502
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:02,914
Then do one thing

1503
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,107
Don't look at his face

1504
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:09,082
Men can't share all theirtensions openly

1505
01:37:09,356 --> 01:37:11,916
You women don't sit
around and create stories

1506
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,787
Oh, so nowthe blame is on women!

1507
01:37:15,596 --> 01:37:16,927
Where are you going?

1508
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:18,564
Won't give a peace of mind!

1509
01:37:18,933 --> 01:37:20,560
Like dad, like son

1510
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:26,529
- Shall I serve this, dear?
- Hmm

1511
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:29,007
Little

1512
01:37:30,945 --> 01:37:31,536
Enough

1513
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:34,409
- Dear, get me tea
- Okay

1514
01:37:36,884 --> 01:37:37,316
Son

1515
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:41,213
Do you have any problem
that can't be discussed with us?

1516
01:37:42,423 --> 01:37:43,151
No dad

1517
01:37:44,058 --> 01:37:46,891
In case if you have, do talk openly,
it is yourdad asking

1518
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:49,625
No dad, won't I tell you
ifthere is anything ofthat kind?

1519
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:54,229
No issues, I will make move,
I am little busy

1520
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:00,840
Where is he going?

1521
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:03,075
He said he is going to hospital

1522
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:04,401
Hospital

1523
01:38:05,412 --> 01:38:06,436
That's quite good

1524
01:38:21,161 --> 01:38:23,322
Whoeverthey may be,
whatthey did is dirty

1525
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:24,394
Obviously..

1526
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:26,858
Stay here fortwo more days
and then leave

1527
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:28,500
Only then will the case get stronger

1528
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:36,338
Don't keep turning and looking.

1529
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:37,066
Who are they? Since a long time..

1530
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:39,504
They are of a team, be patient

1531
01:38:39,713 --> 01:38:41,442
Will this person's relatives chase us away?

1532
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:44,209
No chance, does he look like he has any

1533
01:38:44,618 --> 01:38:47,610
Son, put that thing for him

1534
01:38:47,955 --> 01:38:48,614
This one

1535
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:51,523
Hasn't he been asking for a long time?

1536
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:54,023
- OthenNise the bed will start stinking
- Is it?

1537
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:54,986
Hey Sameer

1538
01:38:55,195 --> 01:38:55,490
You keep

1539
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:57,390
I came for your need, didn't I?

1540
01:39:05,172 --> 01:39:07,231
Dude, just check

1541
01:39:08,075 --> 01:39:08,439
Enough?

1542
01:39:08,642 --> 01:39:09,233
Over?

1543
01:39:12,246 --> 01:39:12,905
Yet not over?

1544
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:19,909
Still not over?

1545
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:20,519
Enough?

1546
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:22,382
Lets go and get food

1547
01:39:24,391 --> 01:39:25,153
Let's move out quickly

1548
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:26,391
Come

1549
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:29,561
How do you feel noVif?

1550
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:33,094
It was sheer fortune to have got his life

1551
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:37,735
Would you be able to identify
the person who rode the bike?

1552
01:39:38,105 --> 01:39:41,336
It was night hours,
so couldn't recognize

1553
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:42,736
Did not recognize!

1554
01:39:46,547 --> 01:39:48,139
Seems she has got only him

1555
01:39:49,049 --> 01:39:50,380
He still fears

1556
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:51,744
Someone is after him

1557
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:54,010
This must have been done by him for sure

1558
01:39:56,457 --> 01:39:59,392
Stay calm, We shall
investigate and find out

1559
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:03,363
Get a detailed report written

1560
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:07,656
Hello, just minute

1561
01:40:20,647 --> 01:40:21,739
Who could it be you said?

1562
01:40:22,249 --> 01:40:23,614
The one who took the photograph

1563
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:24,681
He must be the one

1564
01:40:25,052 --> 01:40:26,747
How are you so sure?

1565
01:40:28,455 --> 01:40:29,353
Fearing that he will get caught

1566
01:40:29,556 --> 01:40:30,716
And to resolve the case,
he would've attempted this

1567
01:40:31,091 --> 01:40:32,752
Else who is benefitted by this?

1568
01:40:33,227 --> 01:40:35,991
- So you are enquiring the things
-Yeah

1569
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:37,026
What is your name?

1570
01:40:38,065 --> 01:40:38,759
Prabhalan

1571
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:41,757
I am the District President of
Kaithangu (Support) Association

1572
01:40:44,805 --> 01:40:49,765
Let me also investigate
who all are benefitted by this case

1573
01:40:52,246 --> 01:40:53,577
Sir, just a minute

1574
01:40:58,419 --> 01:40:59,750
Would it land into trouble?

1575
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:05,516
Do you still wish to see him?

1576
01:41:14,101 --> 01:41:17,764
He is posing like everything
is gone out of hands!

1577
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:29,742
Won't he smile?
Has anything to be given for him to smile?

1578
01:41:30,617 --> 01:41:33,552
Dear, why are you standing
like this in all the shots?

1579
01:41:33,754 --> 01:41:34,778
Can't you smile a bit?

1580
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:37,481
Standing the same way in all photographs!

1581
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:41,485
Ah this looks fabulous!

1582
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:42,660
How does this look, dear?

1583
01:41:52,673 --> 01:41:53,731
This is also nice

1584
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:54,767
How is it?

1585
01:41:57,411 --> 01:41:59,845
Dear, say some thing

1586
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:05,416
Zeenath, I got something to tell you

1587
01:42:06,286 --> 01:42:07,082
What's it, dear?

1588
01:42:09,256 --> 01:42:10,348
This looks good

1589
01:42:11,758 --> 01:42:13,487
I received a call from Company

1590
01:42:15,395 --> 01:42:16,828
To report immediately

1591
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:19,790
Then?

1592
01:42:21,768 --> 01:42:22,757
I agreed

1593
01:42:27,274 --> 01:42:29,139
If you go now, when will you return then?

1594
01:42:35,749 --> 01:42:37,148
Won't it take a year?

1595
01:42:42,589 --> 01:42:43,521
Speak, dear

1596
01:42:45,893 --> 01:42:46,655
Speak

1597
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:50,921
Dear

1598
01:43:10,817 --> 01:43:12,648
You know how many days have it
been after marriage!

1599
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:17,416
Have you spoken anything happily with me?

1600
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:22,420
You go somewhere in the mornings
and return home at evenings

1601
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:25,223
Isn't that what you doing to me?

1602
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:31,694
Didn't you say that you were after me
for a long time for professing your love?

1603
01:43:32,606 --> 01:43:34,801
Now what is this you are doing to me!

1604
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:48,782
Shall I ask you something?

1605
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:51,519
Is anything wrong with me?

1606
01:43:55,329 --> 01:43:59,425
After marriage, did you feel that I am
not the girl matching your expectations?

1607
01:43:59,666 --> 01:44:01,964
What is this, Zeenath?
It's nothing like that

1608
01:44:02,436 --> 01:44:03,403
Then what is the problem, dear

1609
01:44:03,604 --> 01:44:04,400
Don't cry, Zeenath

1610
01:44:04,605 --> 01:44:06,436
In case ifthere is anything,
won't I tell you?

1611
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:08,371
You don't cry

1612
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:09,974
There are problems

1613
01:44:11,445 --> 01:44:12,275
I will tell you

1614
01:44:12,846 --> 01:44:13,608
Stop crying

01:46:20,474 --> 01:46:25,002
"Sky high is the sound of separation"

1647
01:46:25,479 --> 01:46:29,813
"Will turn joyful"

1648
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:37,947
"And are defeated by newness
and dawn on newly sprout wings"

1649
01:46:38,925 --> 01:46:41,917
"To fly, to bloom"

1650
01:46:48,135 --> 01:46:48,931
What is this mom?

1651
01:46:49,136 --> 01:46:50,728
It's around 12 '0 clock
aren't you sleeping?

1652
01:46:52,139 --> 01:46:53,606
Let this also be there

1653
01:46:55,876 --> 01:46:58,140
Anyway you will be returning
only after a long time

1654
01:47:01,515 --> 01:47:07,545
How serious be the matter be, leaving
immediately after marriage, isn't right?

1655
01:47:07,954 --> 01:47:10,946
Leave us, what would her
family members think?

1656
01:47:14,194 --> 01:47:15,752
When you return after your busy work,

1657
01:47:15,929 --> 01:47:18,557
only God knows
whether I and dad will be alive or not

1658
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:19,956
What is this, mom?

1659
01:47:21,568 --> 01:47:27,871
Leave us, but leaving that poor girl
immediately after marriage is not appropriate

1660
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:36,746
Anyways now spend the
remaining time with her

1661
01:47:36,817 --> 01:47:39,149
Go..

1662
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:40,980
Enough, mom, try to go and sleep

1663
01:47:41,188 --> 01:47:42,553
Yes, I shall

1664
01:48:02,509 --> 01:48:03,498
Isn't Sameer at home?

1665
01:48:04,611 --> 01:48:06,238
- He has left
-Where did he go?

1666
01:48:06,947 --> 01:48:08,915
He is gone back to work... to the Gulf

1667
01:48:09,216 --> 01:48:09,910
When did he leave?

1668
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:12,550
- Left just a while back
- Oh okay

1669
01:48:12,752 --> 01:48:13,719
Well, Son who are you?

1670
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:15,153
I am one of Sameer's friend

1671
01:48:15,522 --> 01:48:17,786
- Okay
- Okay

1672
01:48:26,132 --> 01:48:26,757
Sir..

1673
01:48:33,673 --> 01:48:34,605
Okay, Son..

1674
01:48:58,164 --> 01:49:00,189
Mom.. Won't he be returning soon?
Don't worry

1675
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:11,238
Sameer, give me your passport

1676
01:49:16,316 --> 01:49:16,805
Justaminute

1677
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:17,811
You can leave soon

1678
01:49:18,084 --> 01:49:18,778
Come

1679
01:49:24,224 --> 01:49:25,020
Come

1680
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:33,324
Sir

1681
01:49:50,984 --> 01:49:51,814
What's your name?

1682
01:49:52,619 --> 01:49:53,643
Talk loudly

1683
01:49:54,621 --> 01:49:55,815
What is yourfull name?

1684
01:49:58,658 --> 01:49:59,682
Where are you going to now?

1685
01:50:01,828 --> 01:50:02,726
Were you on leave?

1686
01:50:03,330 --> 01:50:03,955
Yes

1687
01:50:05,165 --> 01:50:06,291
How many days was your leave?

1688
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:09,131
One month

1689
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:11,637
Then why are you leaving this early?

1690
01:50:18,645 --> 01:50:19,771
Give me your phone

1691
01:50:27,087 --> 01:50:28,384
Unlock it

1692
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:37,686
Do you know the man seated over there?

1693
01:50:53,413 --> 01:50:54,812
Have you seen him anywhere?

1694
01:50:56,082 --> 01:50:57,106
No..No, Sir

1695
01:50:58,084 --> 01:50:58,743
Haven't?

1696
01:50:59,786 --> 01:51:00,275
No

1697
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:04,718
Get them in

1698
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,185
Sir, he is a very decent fellow

1699
01:51:09,896 --> 01:51:11,955
No Whatsapp orfacebook in his mobile

1700
01:51:12,265 --> 01:51:13,027
Very smart!

1701
01:51:24,177 --> 01:51:24,973
Decent man!

1702
01:51:28,782 --> 01:51:29,771
What's it, son?

1703
01:51:30,483 --> 01:51:31,450
What is it, sir?

1704
01:51:31,885 --> 01:51:32,749
Do you know her?

1705
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:33,975
My mom, Sir

1706
01:51:35,155 --> 01:51:37,419
I have to arrest your mom in a case, Sameer

1707
01:51:41,261 --> 01:51:44,856
That speech challenged person's photo
was taken and victimized on social media

1708
01:51:45,498 --> 01:51:46,328
That is the case

1709
01:51:46,866 --> 01:51:48,128
SIM is in your mom's name

1710
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:49,266
Yourmom will go inside

1711
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:54,298
It was me who did it

1712
01:51:54,474 --> 01:51:55,099
Not my mom

1713
01:51:56,910 --> 01:51:58,343
Hey, We know you did that

1714
01:51:58,511 --> 01:52:00,240
But didn't your poor mom got trapped!

1715
01:52:04,184 --> 01:52:07,347
Sorry Sir, I didn't do it
with any such intention

1716
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:08,452
Didn't expect things would
take go this way either

1717
01:52:08,822 --> 01:52:09,720
I apologize

1718
01:52:09,989 --> 01:52:11,320
Brother, I apologize

1719
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:13,488
Apologize?

1720
01:52:13,993 --> 01:52:15,858
Can the law apologize like you say?

1721
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:18,960
Apart from that, you attempted
to kill by running the vehicle over him.

1722
01:52:19,165 --> 01:52:20,792
Oh Son!

1723
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:21,760
Isn't that correct?

1724
01:52:22,168 --> 01:52:23,465
You thought no one could find out?

1725
01:52:25,105 --> 01:52:27,130
No, I went to seek his apology

1726
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:28,807
No Sir, he won't do such a thing

1727
01:52:29,075 --> 01:52:30,975
You are mistaken

1728
01:52:37,784 --> 01:52:39,479
- Kadeeja Beevi, right?
-Yes

1729
01:52:39,853 --> 01:52:42,321
He posted the photo from the number
in your name

1730
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:45,350
Not just that, the day he met
with an accident

1731
01:52:45,525 --> 01:52:48,858
That you followed him for
which we have all the proofs

1732
01:52:49,195 --> 01:52:51,390
Swear on the Almighty, Swear on mom,
I went to express my apologies

1733
01:52:51,564 --> 01:52:53,828
ls attempting to kill someone
You calling as apology?

1734
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:56,398
Please don't take him.

1735
01:52:56,569 --> 01:52:58,537
He will never harm anyone knowingly

1736
01:52:58,905 --> 01:53:00,805
It's just been 5 days after his marriage

1737
01:53:01,074 --> 01:53:02,302
Tell all that in court

1738
01:53:02,909 --> 01:53:04,399
Please arrest me if you want

1739
01:53:04,577 --> 01:53:08,877
Look at the girl..
they've just begun their lives

1740
01:53:09,415 --> 01:53:10,746
What's the point of regretting noVif?

1741
01:53:11,017 --> 01:53:13,281
Do you know because of him
what all that man had to endure!

1742
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:18,787
Son! If my son has caused any harm to you,
this Mom shall apologize

1743
01:53:19,092 --> 01:53:20,389
Please tell Sirto leave him

1744
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,858
Only if you say, he will leave him

1745
01:53:30,436 --> 01:53:33,098
(Sir, no need of anything)

1746
01:53:33,573 --> 01:53:40,342
(I and my family have
suffered a lot forthis)

1747
01:53:40,847 --> 01:53:43,941
(I don't want to make them to suffer..
Innocent mom)

1748
01:53:52,358 --> 01:53:53,450
(Don't arrest him)

1749
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:01,064
(Please tell him)

1750
01:54:01,267 --> 01:54:04,259
Sir, he says he has no complaint.
He has forgiven

1751
01:54:05,071 --> 01:54:05,867
Forgiven?

1752
01:54:06,573 --> 01:54:07,972
That is not possible!

1753
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:10,039
Based on your complaint,
I arrested the culprit

1754
01:54:10,276 --> 01:54:11,174
And nowyou ask to forgive

1755
01:54:11,377 --> 01:54:12,435
Tell that in the court

1756
01:54:16,115 --> 01:54:16,547
What?

1757
01:54:18,117 --> 01:54:19,379
One minute..

1758
01:54:33,433 --> 01:54:34,457
(Read this to him)

1759
01:54:36,369 --> 01:54:37,529
Law can't forgive

1760
01:54:37,937 --> 01:54:40,497
But we human beings can forgive

1761
01:54:40,907 --> 01:54:42,101
I have no complaint

1762
01:54:43,109 --> 01:54:47,842
(Please no need of all this sir..P
ease)

1763
01:55:05,598 --> 01:55:06,462
Thank you

1764
01:55:07,066 --> 01:55:08,158
Sorry...Sorry

1765
01:55:15,208 --> 01:55:17,506
(Don't worry.. It's okay)

1766
01:55:42,468 --> 01:55:44,026
What is your next programme?

1767
01:55:44,237 --> 01:55:45,261
Shouldn't we look forthe next flight?

1768
01:55:47,373 --> 01:55:50,001
- No, I am not going
-What?

1769
01:55:50,209 --> 01:55:51,005
No, let me stay here forfew days

1770
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:52,040
Nowl am relieved..

1771
01:55:52,245 --> 01:55:53,576
Let me stay with my wife and mom

1772
01:55:54,047 --> 01:55:55,036
Mom, you heard what he said

1773
01:55:55,515 --> 01:55:56,675
Such moments....

1774
01:55:57,650 --> 01:55:59,049
Pics are to be taken!

1775
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:01,452
Come on smile!

1776
01:56:02,055 --> 01:56:04,421
These frames cannot be got in your selfie

1777
01:56:05,224 --> 01:56:06,156
Look straight

1778
01:56:07,226 --> 01:56:08,090
Come on smile

1779
01:56:10,096 --> 01:56:11,063

1781
01:56:12,699 --> 01:56:15,224
- Oh my dude!

1782
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:16,558

1786
01:56:32,051 --> 01:56:33,382

1789
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:40,451
Mom

1790
01:56:44,464 --> 01:56:45,226
Mom, have a look

1791
01:56:46,232 --> 01:56:47,995
- Isn't that nice?
- Yes
