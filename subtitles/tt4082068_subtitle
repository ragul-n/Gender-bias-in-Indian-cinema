1
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,250
This is your children?

2
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:24,247
Yes I do.

3
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:34,674
- Do not you have parents? - Yes, there.

4
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,830
It's your daughter? She has a mother?

5
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,250
It's your daughter?

6
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,620
Tu n'as pas de tente?

7
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,542
You know anyone here?

8
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,115
This is your children?

9
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,705
Those two, yes.

10
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:20,787
She is my niece.

11
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:22,999
Where is his mother?

12
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,500
She is dead.

13
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,827
Do not you cry, you say nothing.

14
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,915
That's my girl. She is 9 years old.

15
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:45,674
It's my daughter. She is 9 years old.

16
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,075
It suits you?

17
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,825
T'as quel âge?

18
00:03:57,834 --> 00:04:00,674
- 26 years. - No, your real age!

19
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,367
26 years.

20
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:05,254
You do not look like the photo.

21
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:06,957
Attache your hair.

22
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:08,667
And losing weight.

23
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,039
Natarajan Dheepan he was 35 years old.

24
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,997
Sa femme, Waterside, 24 ans.

25
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:19,672
Their daughter, Illayaal, 9 years.

26
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,037
They died 6 months ago.

27
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:25,212
Now that family is you.

28
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:47,674
This really is your daughter?

29
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:51,417
It's your family?

30
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,462
You know her?

31
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:58,207
No. Why?

32
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,710
You're gonna leave us here?

33
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:06,207
No, but it is you who in occupied. Including?

34
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,422
Where we take the plane?

35
00:05:12,584 --> 00:05:13,754
At Madras.

36
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,415
Where we arrive in England?

37
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,459
We're not in England.

38
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,500
Where are we going, then?

39
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:31,294
And France.

40
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,920
The first half, move!

41
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,499
Hurry, first boat!

42
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:41,327
Other second boat! Go forward!

43
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:44,504
Hurry!

44
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,539
Dheepan! The cops, cops, come!

45
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,035
Fuck! I can not anymore.

46
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:08,919
Get up.

47
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:14,995
T'as de l'argent?

48
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,165
In the jacket.

49
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,462
Closes the pane.

50
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,002
Goes further, we need to talk.

51
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:22,582
It's not going to work.

52
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,957
They will see that we lied.

53
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,745
What do you propose?

54
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,537
I can not wait.

55
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,619
I go to my cousin in England.

56
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,075
With the small?

57
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,955
Why would it be for me to take?

58
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:38,964
You found it, you the guards.

59
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,872
I worked for an NGO.

60
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,749
I was a journalist peace activist.

61
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:57,044
And the Sri Lankan government accused me of ...

62
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,004
I know your history ...

63
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,707
The "peace activist".

64
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,712
It's your smuggler who sold it to you?

65
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,165
You were on which side during the war?

66
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,212
And you?

67
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,415
What is your real name?

68
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,252
Sivadhasan.

69
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,580
I thought you were dead. Your family still there?

70
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,209
They all died.

71
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,459
I said what?

72
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,325
Tell him that the Tigers have recruited you force

73
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,000
and that the Sri Lankan army hath captured, tortured,

74
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,207
and they tried to kill you.

75
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,962
I was wanted by the army.

76
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,165
They tortured me and tried to kill me.

77
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:24,424
You sure this is the right train?

78
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:33,754
What does that mean, "Le Pré"?

79
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,077
"Le Pré", what does that mean?

80
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:39,462
This is where we will live.

81
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,325
What does it mean?

82
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,787
This is a small meadow, pasture.

83
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:12,205
I will have my room?

84
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,792
I dunno. We'll see later.

85
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:28,999
Someone there?

86
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:56,672
Try to translate what he says.

87
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:03,504
He talks too fast. I do not understand.

88
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:04,617
It is not serious.

89
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,250
Asked whether the water is drinkable.

90
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:00,834
He talked about us?

91
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:01,957
Not.

92
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:32,079
You must wait until they are gone.

93
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,620
Milk, honey, sugar and lentils

94
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:44,422
I gathered these foods and I offer them.

95
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:47,502
Oh god with an elephant head, like a pure diamond,

96
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:50,119
Give me the three Tamil "Sangam".

97
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,245
O God Ganesh!

98
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,167
Do that no problem

99
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,579
and that all is well here.

100
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:10,254
Come eat.

101
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,870
Here.

102
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:32,707
Take a spoon.

103
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,330
It can eat with your fingers.

104
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,165
Tomorrow in school, she will have to eat with a spoon.

105
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,747
I can not find my satchel.

106
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,035
Go to bed.

107
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,710
T'as un oreiller?

108
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,415
You're a child!

109
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:07,874
You not need it.

110
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,995
I'll sleep there.

111
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,294
Put yourself further.

112
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,172
What does she say?

113
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:31,874
How "government" is said?

114
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:14,039
They ask many questions. That burned the school, why, how?

115
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,119
Everyone burns schools.

116
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:17,462
Why do you say that?

117
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,665
I do not want!

118
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,665
I want to stay with you!

119
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:24,579
Not let me!

120
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,750
Look at me.

121
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,790
It was a secret, all three.

122
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,119
I want to go.

123
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:34,462
Do not forget it.

124
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,075
We, the adults, we have to work.

125
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:39,829
And you,

126
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,035
you have to go to school and learn French.

127
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:46,865
You have to speak like other children.

128
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:49,919
Otherwise, we will return to our country.

129
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:51,962
Did you want to return?

130
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:53,622
T'as envie?

131
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,665
Neither do I.

132
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,329
Look at me.

133
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:00,919
Look at me!

134
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:02,579
You and you're going?

135
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:04,919
Get up.

136
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,004
vas-y.

137
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:20,329
Zaoui.

138
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,075
Building B.

139
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,420
"Z".

140
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:29,367
Samir Ben Cherif. "S" ...

141
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,289
Here, try. Sorts that.

142
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:36,579
He.

143
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,000
"D"...

144
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,117
It is easy.

145
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:45,539
I do not know them. You can not ask Youssouf?

146
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:49,415
What's he going to think if mind all the time?

147
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:51,334
Everyone has a locker.

148
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,040
People hit you their works.

149
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,794
They take their mail and voila.

150
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,120
And after?

151
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,212
I tell them what?

152
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,955
You want to tell them what?

153
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:10,869
You present yourself, you are friendly and that's it.

154
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,960
Dheepan!

155
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,495
I am here.

156
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,620
- Come! - What for?

157
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:32,624
Come quick!

158
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:33,825
Why?

159
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:57,172
If you do not know, why are you telling me to do?

160
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,544
Let them talk.

161
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:01,539
You understand them, you? I look for what?

162
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:02,789
Tais-toi!

163
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,670
What do you want?

164
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,245
She's crying.

165
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:28,004
It's nothing. She's tired. Go to bed.

166
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:36,619
What now?

167
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:39,794
Can I stay with you?

168
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,040
One.

169
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,825
It must have been a child's room.

170
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:19,120
"The involvement of India in the conflict against the Tamil Tigers ..."

171
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:32,464
Give me a kiss, like everyone else.

172
00:29:59,084 --> 00:30:02,254
I can not do everything alone.

173
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:06,294
It is as if I had two kids on our hands!

174
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:08,325
You can not work, you?

175
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,460
And that is not work?

176
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,785
Work out, for pay.

177
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:17,174
When I go out, everyone looks at me.

178
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:20,424
It is new, it's normal that we look.

179
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:21,997
We will do it.

180
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:28,542
Here, many women wear a headscarf.

181
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,754
You could do the same.

182
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,040
The scarf is not my religion.

183
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:34,922
I will not talk about religion.

184
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,117
But to do like everyone else. And...

185
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:41,334
stop making the mouth whenever I say something!

186
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,870
This is an old man of Building G.

187
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,002
Cooking and cleaning.

188
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:23,415
It's well paid.

189
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:24,707
How many?

190
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,790
Many, but act as if it was normal. 500.

191
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:31,922
500 euros?

192
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:35,169
What I said to you? Accepts, that's all.

193
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:45,044
Who will take care of Illayaal?

194
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,330
I'll take care.

195
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,422
500?

196
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,004
You calculate in rupees?

197
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:05,752
- For a month ... - 500 multiplied by 170 ...

198
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,710
85000th?

199
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:44,707
- Who's the type? - I do not know, like those below.

200
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:46,327
What are they doing with the old?

201
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,830
They remain locked up in the living room.

202
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,540
They talk as if it was their office.

203
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,915
- Who is it? - Thugs.

204
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:57,292
Gang? As Vannilas and Minnal?

205
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:01,787
A little similar, but less dangerous.

206
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:06,002
Youssouf said it is normal here.

207
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:43,582
What does it say?

208
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,830
This is poetry.

209
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,710
On friendship.

210
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:10,794
Are you kidding me?

211
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,080
Who do you think You Are?

212
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,995
I want to see you! Out!

213
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:23,374
I hate you!

214
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:43,577
My mother is dead! I have no mother.

215
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,670
You could still be nice to me.

216
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:51,044
I know how to do with children.

217
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:52,419
I know nothing.

218
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,289
You had children in Sri Lanka?

219
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,120
Brothers, sisters?

220
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:11,707
Two little brothers.

221
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:16,499
You were not kind to them?

222
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,172
And!

223
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,580
Why do not you do the same with me.

224
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:57,785
I can ask you a question?

225
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:02,584
You find them funny, you, the people here?

226
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,075
I dunno. Why?

227
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:12,250
Sometimes they say things and they laugh.

228
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:14,867
I understand all the words,

229
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,870
but I find it funny.

230
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:22,292
It is not a question of language.

231
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:23,915
What is it then?

232
00:49:26,084 --> 00:49:28,124
It is a question of humor.

233
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,214
On French humor?

234
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:37,575
On any short humor.

235
00:49:41,209 --> 00:49:43,249
You're not funny.

236
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:46,825
Even in Tamil, you're not funny.

237
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:52,457
Never?

238
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,245
What?

239
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,620
That's good.

240
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:08,207
What?

241
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:12,747
When talking like that, that's fine.

242
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:49,834
Your turn.

243
00:56:20,459 --> 00:56:21,959
What are you doing?

244
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:33,712
It's funny ... it's like the movies.

245
00:56:43,959 --> 00:56:45,579
You see that dog?

246
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,250
I know him.

247
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:08,287
I take everything?

248
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:11,042
No, just that.

249
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:21,999
First, we go to the temple.

250
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,294
After that?

251
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,424
You've taken everything?

252
00:58:28,917 --> 00:58:29,827
Fritters,

253
00:58:30,584 --> 00:58:31,674
the "rolls".

254
01:00:02,917 --> 01:00:04,537
Tu me parlais the Shoban.

255
01:00:04,709 --> 01:00:07,209
It is in Dortmund, now.

256
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:09,495
You can have her number?

257
01:00:10,334 --> 01:00:11,834
You see Ravi?

258
01:00:12,334 --> 01:00:13,794
One who is in Dortmund.

259
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:17,582
Ravi, can I have the number Shoban.

260
01:00:22,709 --> 01:00:25,169
My brother, you have crossed?

261
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,870
What's New?

262
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:26,499
You know...

263
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:30,502
The Greeks cut the head to the bearers of bad news.

264
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:33,539
The colonel is Cheran.

265
01:01:33,834 --> 01:01:35,124
He wants to see you.

266
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:38,115
- He is alone? - Yes.

267
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,830
Wait here.

268
01:01:59,709 --> 01:02:00,789
He's there.

269
01:02:07,834 --> 01:02:09,374
Attention softly.

270
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:11,825
Gently.

271
01:02:13,584 --> 01:02:14,964
- How are you? - Yes.

272
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,000
You want some water?

273
01:02:18,792 --> 01:02:20,042
Tell him to come in.

274
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,960
Between!

275
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:32,214
Sivadhasan!

276
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:37,537
It has been a long time.

277
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:39,457
How are you?

278
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,420
I'm happy to see you.

279
01:02:45,959 --> 01:02:48,329
I was told that you had been beheaded

280
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,620
and had been identified you.

281
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:54,252
I have an important mission.

282
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,250
Look for money.

283
01:02:58,292 --> 01:03:00,332
I contacted the Lebanese.

284
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,330
They want $ 100,000 for weapons.

285
01:03:05,209 --> 01:03:08,369
Those here still support the cause?

286
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,080
Why do you want guns, sir?

287
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,080
To send the country!

288
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:20,369
Who, in the country?

289
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,000
Comrades!

290
01:03:27,084 --> 01:03:28,084
Mon colonel,

291
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:30,579
all is finished.

292
01:03:31,709 --> 01:03:34,209
At Nandhikadal, I lost all my section.

293
01:03:35,459 --> 01:03:37,039
My wife is dead.

294
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:38,712
My children are dead.

295
01:03:39,417 --> 01:03:40,787
The war is over.

296
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,577
What are you saying?

297
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,120
Say that again!

298
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,205
Okay, sir.

299
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:49,577
The war is not over.

300
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:51,825
But for me...

301
01:03:52,042 --> 01:03:53,172
It's over.

302
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:10,622
Go in search of the graves of our enemies

303
01:04:10,792 --> 01:04:15,332
And continue the struggle for Tamil!

304
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:19,495
Our wounds will not close again

305
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:24,287
But I never cease to dream

306
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:28,750
We are not so far away. See the border of our enemies!

307
01:04:29,209 --> 01:04:32,749
Go in search of the graves of our enemies

308
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:37,037
And continue the struggle for Tamil!

309
01:04:37,834 --> 01:04:41,674
See all these ruined houses

310
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:46,424
Soon they will be rebuilt

311
01:04:46,709 --> 01:04:50,829
Hear crying in the refugee camps

312
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,960
These children will be crying tomorrow Tigers

313
01:04:56,125 --> 01:05:00,205
Our sufferings were not written

314
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:04,167
If all Tamils ​​united, there would be more opposite camp

315
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:06,174
Plus the adverse camp

316
01:05:06,334 --> 01:05:10,174
Pronounce the name of our leader and be ready to fight!

317
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:22,997
It stinks of the mouth.

318
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,455
How are you?

319
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,210
What happened?

320
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,920
You sure are you?

321
01:06:48,084 --> 01:06:49,754
Why he slept with us?

322
01:06:49,917 --> 01:06:51,077
I do not know.

323
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:53,424
He had a nightmare.

324
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:36,292
This is not my daughter.

325
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:41,037
Ni mon mari.

326
01:09:44,459 --> 01:09:45,669
Everything is false.

327
01:09:56,334 --> 01:09:58,174
Home ...

328
01:09:58,709 --> 01:10:02,289
You fall, you smile. You're hurting you, you smile.

329
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:05,292
Here...

330
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:08,619
If you smile too much,

331
01:10:09,584 --> 01:10:12,624
people believe that thou not understand

332
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,172
or you make fun of them.

333
01:13:19,584 --> 01:13:21,544
Go to your room!

334
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,620
- Why are they doing this? - Shut up!

335
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:27,122
In your bedroom!

336
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,540
You sleep?

337
01:17:27,459 --> 01:17:28,619
What are you doing?

338
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:31,329
- I'm leaving. - Or?

339
01:17:31,959 --> 01:17:32,919
En Angleterre.

340
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,830
At my cousin's.

341
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:36,577
I called.

342
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,540
We had to wait for our papers.

343
01:17:39,084 --> 01:17:42,124
I imagined that people would shoot it!

344
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:45,077
It reminds you nothing, all that?

345
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:47,674
This is not the same.

346
01:17:49,584 --> 01:17:50,754
Why?

347
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,035
Because there, it was you who was shooting?

348
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,870
It is that right?

349
01:18:06,334 --> 01:18:08,714
Your passport, how did you get?

350
01:18:11,084 --> 01:18:12,924
What do you believe?

351
01:18:13,625 --> 01:18:15,285
Are you going to stop me from leaving?

352
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:23,865
I leave!

353
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,000
I will go to England.

354
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:00,455
What are you meddling?

355
01:19:44,292 --> 01:19:45,872
Qu'est-ce que t'as?

356
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:48,959
Let me go or I'll scream!

357
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:02,749
You left without Illayaal?

358
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:05,747
Yes I do.

359
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,665
You can abandon it?

360
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,752
You thought what?

361
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:24,080
You've come to believe that story?

362
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:30,459
You think I'm his mother?

363
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:34,327
She thinks I'm his mother?

364
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:40,789
You're not my husband, Dheepan.

365
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:44,667
I'm not your wife.

366
01:20:46,084 --> 01:20:47,874
And it's not our daughter.

367
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:12,502
Spoken.

368
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:17,042
But talking about!

369
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:19,325
What?

370
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:24,374
I will not move from here.

371
01:24:04,042 --> 01:24:05,212
No Fire Zone!

372
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:47,285
The director wants you to sign this.

373
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:49,669
That is why?

374
01:24:50,292 --> 01:24:52,042
To make an appointment.

375
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:54,497
Why?

376
01:24:55,334 --> 01:24:58,294
She wants to put me in a normal class.

377
01:25:00,209 --> 01:25:01,329
Come eat.

378
01:25:08,292 --> 01:25:09,672
What are you doing?

379
01:25:09,834 --> 01:25:11,624
I'll be back in 5 minutes.

380
01:25:38,334 --> 01:25:40,334
This is your new army?

381
01:25:41,209 --> 01:25:43,169
What is your plan?

382
01:25:43,459 --> 01:25:45,369
You're going to train?

383
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,290
You gonna buy weapons?

384
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:55,960
You have everything?

385
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:57,205
Yes I do.

386
01:27:32,542 --> 01:27:33,962
You went to see him?

387
01:27:34,459 --> 01:27:35,419
Not!

388
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:38,252
Youssouf picked me.

389
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,670
Why you?

390
01:27:40,542 --> 01:27:42,582
Because he knows me.

391
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,250
Why not talk about me?

392
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:49,367
What are you going to do?

393
01:27:50,125 --> 01:27:52,865
Why are you meddling us all?

394
01:27:53,209 --> 01:27:54,619
Who's "we"?

395
01:27:54,792 --> 01:27:58,622
A little thug threatens to kill me and you say it like that?

396
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:01,620
It makes you neither hot nor cold?

397
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,460
- It's for your ... - Shut up!

398
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:29,870
What do you want?

399
01:28:33,959 --> 01:28:35,459
Why are you touching me?

400
01:28:35,959 --> 01:28:37,209
Excuse-moi.

401
01:28:40,167 --> 01:28:41,617
It takes you like that?

402
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:46,960
I do not want!

403
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:51,749
I do not want.

404
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:06,037
Take off your coat.

405
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:30,615
I can go on the anniversary of Yasmine?

406
01:30:31,209 --> 01:30:32,959
You ask Dad.

407
01:31:06,042 --> 01:31:07,832
What are you doing?

408
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:13,495
When are you coming back?

409
01:31:16,209 --> 01:31:17,209
I dunno.

410
01:31:22,542 --> 01:31:24,922
I found the passport and money.

411
01:31:28,334 --> 01:31:29,294
Thank you.

412
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:47,040
I'll call my cousin.

413
01:31:48,459 --> 01:31:51,329
I will go to England with Illayaal, after the summer.

414
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:55,707
I will inform the school.

415
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:58,170
Returns.

416
01:41:03,042 --> 01:41:05,422
Calm down, tell me what happens.

417
01:41:13,084 --> 01:41:14,674
Who will kill you?

418
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:23,035
T'es où, là?

419
01:41:26,209 --> 01:41:27,539
T'es où?

420
01:45:44,792 --> 01:45:45,622
Do not move!

421
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:50,115
Where is he?

422
01:45:50,834 --> 01:45:51,964
Where is he?

423
01:45:53,084 --> 01:45:54,254
He is dead.

424
01:45:59,417 --> 01:46:00,497
It's me.

425
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:09,205
Look at me!

426
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,000
All that blood ...

427
01:46:30,625 --> 01:46:31,825
Are you hurt?

428
01:46:33,542 --> 01:46:34,922
It's his blood.
