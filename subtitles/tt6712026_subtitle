1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,583


3
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:27,833
Do you know who I am?
I'm a politician!

4
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,792
If the people give you way,
you get to either Vanarapet or Saidapet.

5
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:35,750
You mess with them,
you'll end up at the Kanamapet cemetery!

6
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,458
What's your take on the Kaveri issue, sir?

7
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:44,542
The minute I land in Chennai,
a permanent solution will be ready.

8
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,542
'Wonder who's gonna put you in a spot?'

9
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:53,125
'Wonder who's gonna stroke your ego?'

10
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,208
'Wonder who's gonna steal your dreams?'

11
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,833
'For this is life
and it has no preview whatsoever.'

12
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,333
'There can be no merriment
on one's own.'

13
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:08,000
'And there can be no worriment
on one's own.'

14
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,625
'In the mirror of our hearts...'

15
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,625
'...there is no dearth of people
who want to glimpse at themselves.'

16
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,167
Show a profit on my investment first.

17
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:21,250
Become the best.
I'll raise your funding.

18
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,833
How many of you,
in the film department?

19
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,917
And how many of you,
in the documentary department?

20
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,292
Our political rivals cannot force our hand.

21
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,083
Don't just stand there.
Get them out of here!

22
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:52,458
This is another attempt by the opposition
to humiliate us.

23
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,125
'One day, love blooms with so-and-so.'

24
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,958
'One day, conflict arises with so-and-so.'

25
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,417
'Who knows who desires whom?'

26
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:07,250
'Is wisdom just a state of ignorance?'

27
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,792
'There can be no merriment
on one's own.'

28
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,458
'And there can be no worriment
on one's own.'

29
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:18,000
'In the mirror of our hearts...'

30
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,625
'...there is no dearth of people
who want to glimpse themselves.'

31
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,500
'Wonder who's gonna put you in a spot?'

32
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:51,250
'Wonder who's gonna stroke your ego?'

33
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,167
'Wonder who's gonna steal your dream?'

34
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:39,542
Thilak, this is my final diploma project.
Don't screw it up.

35
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:45,083
You're going to part ways.
We cut to the last shot, which is the hug.

36
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,917
The hug should be divine and gentle.
Not sexual. Do you get it?

37
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:51,042
Just do what I say.
That's enough.

38
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:54,000
But, can we do away with the hug?
I feel nervous.

39
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,625
Look at me, I'm sweating bullets.
-It's just acting. Nothing more.

40
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,375
Think of her as a doll.
A wooden doll at that!

41
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,250
Nimmi, spit it out now!

42
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,667
Creep! What did I tell you to do?
And what the hell are you doing?

43
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,708
I'm sorry, Malar.
I'm so sorry.

44
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,250
Idiot! She dumped you
and kicked you out of her life.

45
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,292
Why the hell do you mope around
dreaming about her?

46
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,292
To what do you owe this fall?

47
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,500
She was the one who directed me.
She was the one who told me to hug.

48
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,375
To make the scene more effective,
I improvised a kiss.

49
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,000
Ok, come here now.
-Why don't you get serious and settle down?

50
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:09,708
You wasted all your dad's money
in making pointless documentaries.

51
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:13,292
And who ended up watching it?
Only your father and I.

52
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:17,250
In the name of making a documentary
you have forced me to live in poverty.

53
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:23,167
Dad, life is too short to stand around.
One has to live it up.

54
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:24,458
You loafer!

55
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:28,708
You claim that your future is in TV.
You start work at Zen1 TV today.

56
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,333
It's eight A.M. and you aren't ready yet.

57
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,208
At least try and hold on to this job,
you slacker.

58
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,958
Else you'll end up as peddler
not far from here.

59
00:07:56,292 --> 00:08:00,333
What are you protesting against, sir?
-I'm protesting against Gandhi.

60
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,958
Not against! For Gandhi!
-That's right. For Gandhi.

61
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:10,167
Brother, why are they protesting?
-There is this sleazy talk show on Zen1.

62
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:13,292
Someone sparked a controversy
by slandering Gandhi.

63
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:16,792
And these politicians are protesting
to gain publicity.

64
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:20,792
When I was twelve, I bumped off a guy,
because he messed with my father.

65
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, just bumped him around a bit.
If I'd do that for my dud of a father...

66
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:31,000
Think I'll let anyone dishonor
the father of the nation?

67
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,375
We shouldn't.
-That's right. We shouldn't.

68
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,042
But my dear folks,
Gandhi has tied my hands.

69
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:42,333
This will be a non-violent protest.

70
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,208
For showing him in negative light.
What's the name again?

71
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,083
Zen1 TV
-I condemn Zen1 TV.

72
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:53,125
Zen1 TV should go down,
for speaking ill of Mahatma Gandhi.

73
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,708
Ashok, why has it not started yet?

74
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,833
It will be done and dusted in two minutes.

75
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,833
You all look like thugs.
Get changed guys.

76
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,958
Get changed soon!

77
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,292
Hurry up.
You've only got two minutes.

78
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:10,000
Sir, with cops and politicians around,
we need more money for this job.

79
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,250
There you go hiking it in the 11th hour.
We're not going anywhere.

80
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,167
Don't worry.
-This is no easy job.

81
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:25,625
We should blend in with the crowd
and not arouse any suspicion.

82
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,833
This isn't something new for us.

83
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,500
We got to get it done and escape
before the cops get wind of it.

84
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,833
'Thug' written on your face.
Get changed soon. Remove your chain.

85
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,417
Take only the tomatoes and eggs.
Leave the weapons.

86
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,208
Else in the heat of the moment,
you might kill someone.

87
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,542
Use tomatoes and eggs.
No bulbs and flares yet.

88
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,750
Mom, do you want tomatoes or eggs?

89
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,333
Who the hell are you?
Buzz off!

90
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:59,583
Are you guys selling tomatoes and eggs?
-Yeah right. We are cooking up a feast.

91
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,625
Whoa, bulbs with wicks!
Can one use it without electricity?

92
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,042
Just stay away and mind your business.

93
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,000
For defiling the name of the Mahatma,
-Death to Zen1 TV.

94
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,500
I condemn Zen1 TV which spoke against
the father of the nation.

95
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,583
Zen1 TV which spoke against Mahatma,
should go down.

96
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,917
Zen1 TV Down! Down!
-Down! Down!

97
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,375
Pass it on.

98
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,583
Let's get started.
- Zen1 TV. Down! Down!

99
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,167
Who are these guys?

100
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,917
They don't seem like our party men!

101
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,750
Open the gates.
Quick!

102
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,500
Don't spare a single cameraman.

103
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:30,667
You want to see the old 'Mannar' again?
Bring it on!

104
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,000
Who sent you guys?

105
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,417
Who do you think you are messing with?

106
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,542
Bring it on!
You don't want to mess with me.

107
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,542
The cops are here.
Let's scoot.

108
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,083
Who were they?

109
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,458
We aren't responsible.
-Don't cause any trouble. We have orders.

110
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,500
Why are you arresting us?
-Come with us. Please co-operate.

111
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,958
Blot on Gandhi's image,
so they say.

112
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,375
And a protest to condemn it,
ends up in violence.

113
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,083
How did a nonviolent protest
end up in violence?

114
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,625
How did Gandhians turn into rogues?

115
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,583
Do you know what really happened here?

116
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:40,000
Who were the thugs who disrupted this?

117
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,333
Are they henchmen?
If so, who orchestrated this?

118
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,250
Continue watching to find out the truth.
Thank you.

119
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,042
Politicians were looking
to gain publicity at our cost.

120
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:54,708
But you ripped them apart.
That's very smart of you, Kalyan.

121
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,125
Did your car get a nice egg-wash, Pillai?

122
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,500
Is it a laughing matter?
With all the ruckus and the damage caused.

123
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:06,708
That isn't an issue at all.
It'll be covered extensively in the papers.

124
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't know if there will be a debate
about Gandhi on social media...

125
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,208
...but our channel and the show
will gain a lot of publicity.

126
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:18,750
Take it from me.
Our TRP ratings will skyrocket.

127
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,667
It isn't ethical
to cheat our own fraternity.

128
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,375
Stones from inside a glass house?

129
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,458
That's why I have rusty old people
like you, on my team.

130
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:31,500
The trend is to do the exact opposite
of what you have to say.

131
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,125
That kind of stuff is
popular among us youngsters.

132
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,708
Oh! You identify yourself with the youth?
You look more like a phone booth to me.

133
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,458
Are you the new hire?
Late on your very first day?

134
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,667
I was delayed because of the riot outside.

135
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:07,000
Were you just gawking at it?
-No sir, I was shooting it.

136
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,625
"How did a non-violent protest
end up in violence?"

137
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,000
"Who were the thugs who disrupted this?"

138
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,333
"Are they henchmen?
If so, who orchestrated this?"

139
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,875
Go to the conference hall
in the first floor.

140
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:25,250
Sir, the phone is mine.
-I'll give it back. Get going.

141
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,167
Who is Mr. Shifty Eyes? Does he work here?
-He is the news editor.

142
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:39,792
My dear, no one knows the how and when.
But when it's time, I'll arrive in style.

143
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,167
Malar, mimicry is the only thing
that justifies his salary here.

144
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,083
Sorry, I don't know what happened.
-Shut up, Thilak.

145
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,583
If Nimmi kissed you,
why didn't you pull back?

146
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,750
You were smooching away.

147
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,750
Did you not hear me yelling "cut"?

148
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,042
Did you say "cut"?
I heard it as "cuddle".

149
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,375
Yeah right.
You creep.

150
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,875
When I hugged her,
I closed my eyes.

151
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,125
With every touch,
I only thought about you.

152
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:26,208
But deep down in my heart
I knew that it wasn't you.

153
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:31,708
Oh boy, but with curves like those!

154
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,875
That's where I slipped.

155
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,750
Men are all the same.
Such creeps.

156
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,875
Men!
You'll make out even in a sewer.

157
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,500
Stop it, now!
What's the big deal?

158
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:44,708
Listen up!
Scorpions sting, serpents bite...

159
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,667
...and men will be men.

160
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,875
It's a biological urge.
Understand that.

161
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,458
I'll slap the hell out of you!

162
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,875
Would you be okay with it,
if I had done the same?

163
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,500
Stop it, Malar.
Enough.

164
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,833
Don't blow it out of proportion.

165
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,125
If you constantly suspect me,
how can we ever get along?

166
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,708
So you'll get along better with her?

167
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,417
Get lost!
-Sorry.

168
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,417
I don't want to see you again.

169
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,083
You cheat.
Don't ever come into my life.

170
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,333
I don't want to see your face
ever again in my life.

171
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,375
I don't want to see you
even in my dreams.

172
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,208
How are you, Malar?

173
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,333
Do you guys know each other?

174
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,708
I'm Jagan. Associate Producer.

175
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,958
And my disciple, the promo producer.

176
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,625
You are late. Go join the new recruits.

177
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,917
Is this your purse?
-Think you're being funny, do you?

178
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:00,292
The bag might actually fit you just right.

179
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:03,000
Guys, boss is here.
-Time for you to suck up.

180
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:11,000
Hello guys, I'm Kalyan.

181
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,583
He is the chairman of Zen network.
I'm Bavana. Introduce yourselves.

182
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,583
Sir, I'm Nishanti.
I was a producer with Terra TV.

183
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:21,792
Hello Sir, I'm Arthy.
News reader.

184
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,250
Sir, I'm Thilak.
-Enough, it's getting a little boring.

185
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:29,917
When you achieve something here,
I will care to learn your names.

186
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,250
Let's come to the point.
There is a new idea for a music show.

187
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,625
Something which no one has tried before.

188
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,042
Fresh talents.
A cheerful duo of anchors.

189
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,875
Three judges from the film industry.

190
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,917
Do we have a name for it yet?
-We have shortlisted a few names.

191
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:48,667
Don't we have such shows already?

192
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,125
Isn't it true?

193
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,167
Sir, this aunty is pulling my shirt.
-Don't call her that.

194
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,667
Go ahead and say what you want.

195
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,625
Can I use the board, sir?
-Sure.

196
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:11,625
CH stands for channel.
And we have many channels on the block.

197
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,833
Every channel tries to do something new.

198
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,708
Most of them flop
and a few make it to the top.

199
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,792
Soon, the other channels follow suit
and try to imitate their success.

200
00:18:22,917 --> 00:18:27,042
Let's say he makes an omelette.
This guy peppers it up.

201
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:30,333
This guy adds a dash of salt.
Another adds vegetables.

202
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,833
And so on and so forth.

203
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:39,417
Everyone is busy reinventing the wheel.
And making photocopies of the same.

204
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:43,458
We end up with almost the same content
in all the channels.

205
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,875
We find ourselves stuck
in an indefinite loop.

206
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,375
We are caught in a vicious cycle.

207
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,208
No amount of drawing
is going to help woo any of these girls.

208
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,458
Girls, be wary of him.

209
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:02,125
Sometimes it is so hard
to tell the difference between channels.

210
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,583
Mr. Documentary, don't just talk the talk.
You must walk the talk.

211
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,625
Can you prove yourself by doing
something different?

212
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,250
I will give you a month's time.

213
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:23,250
"Today, a political party led by Dheeran
fought against our channel."

214
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,208
"A non-violent protest ends in violence."

215
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:31,833
"Rioters vandalized the property
by pelting stones."

216
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:39,375
"Based on the complaint raised by Zen1 TV,
Dheeran and his men have been arrested."

217
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,875
"Internal conflicts within the party
seem to be the primary cause for the riot."

218
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,292
"The rioter's rampage was valiantly
captured by our reporter Thilak."

219
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,583
This must be the handwork
of the opposition.

220
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,417
"Blot on Gandhi's image, they say."

221
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,500
"A non-violent protest ends in a riot."

222
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:59,375
"These people are capable of using
Gandhi's walking stick as a weapon."

223
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,125
"How did a non-violent protest
end in violence?"

224
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,250
"How did Gandhians turn into rogues?"

225
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,583
Wait, there is more.
Why did they edit it out?

226
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,750
That's a wonderful job.
A very interesting perspective.

227
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,958
I gave you a month's time.
But you've proved yourself in a minute.

228
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,375
Bavana, assign them
to their respective departments.

229
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,667
Malar and Jagan, show them around
when you guys have the time.

230
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,583
Sir, what just happened?
The footage has been edited.

231
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,167
Here is your phone.
-Why did you edit it out?

232
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:38,292
I had talked about the people
behind this riot. Why wasn't it aired?

233
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:42,542
Management will decide
what and what not to air.

234
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:47,042
This isn't fair, sir.
-Learn to live with it.

235
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,667
You and your ideas!

236
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:56,333
The primary studio which hosts live shows,
interviews and debates.

237
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:00,375
This is the primary edit suite.
All of post-production takes place here.

238
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,125
PCR stands for Production Control Room.
The broadcasts are controlled from here.

239
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:10,708
Instructions to anchors
and cameramen are given from here.

240
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,208
This is the Master Control Room.

241
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,042
This is CAR.
-Car? Where is the driver?

242
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,167
CAR stands for Central Apparatus Room.

243
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:26,208
All the programs are integrated
and broadcast from here.

244
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:31,250
From here, it is transmitted to the dish
and you get to watch Zen1 TV.

245
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,292
Looks like he is trying
to woo you already.

246
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:39,250
A ringtone in Malar's name?
-I've had it for two years.

247
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:02,250
'You once bestowed upon me
the very air I breathed.'

248
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:07,125
'When you left,
you robbed me off my very breath.'

249
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,917
'Like a leaf afloat on water,
days glide along the tides of time.'

250
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:16,500
'The moonlight showers upon the leaf
with intense heat.'

251
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:21,167
'You bruised me,
O beautiful one.'

252
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:26,083
'And you became erroneous,
O celestial cloud.'

253
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:30,500
'You arose as a wall at my door
and confined me within.'

254
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:35,958
'Have you surfaced again
to bait me with your charms?'

255
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:40,875
'You once bestowed upon me
the very air that I breathed.'

256
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,833
'When you left,
you robbed me off my breath.'

257
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:23,625
'We wandered together joyously
within the confines of our campus.'

258
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,500
'Your every caress is a breeze
that steals my heart away.'

259
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:33,167
'When the robe slides,
revealing a petite waist...'

260
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:37,833
'...my desire gets rekindled,
oh my dear Cinderella.'

261
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,417
'Far and wide in all of outer space,
I saw just your beautiful round face.'

262
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:47,167
'Deep within my heart,
I waged a war of love.'

263
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:52,000
'Love shall prevail,
beyond the edges of time and space.'

264
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:57,542
'But when you left me, my girl,
I killed my dream halfway.'

265
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:02,417
'You bestowed upon me,
the very air that I breathed.'

266
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:06,875
'When you left,
you robbed me off my very breath.'

267
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,458
'It is your stubbornness
that makes you wander in solitude.'

268
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:45,208
'And it is my self-esteem
that doesn't let me near your shadow.'

269
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:50,042
'My love isn't a weightless non-entity.'

270
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:54,542
'Itâs an enduring memory,
as heavy as a mountain.'

271
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:59,083
'Even in a vacant room,
being far away from you is pure agony.'

272
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:04,000
'Your heart will never know, my dear,
the pained words penned by my heart.'

273
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:08,792
'When you stand silently afar,
I am left with no burden.'

274
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:13,625
'To fall in love again,
I have no tears left.'

275
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,958
'You once bestowed upon me
the very air that I breathed.'

276
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:28,000
'When you left,
you robbed me off my very breath.'

277
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:33,500
'Like a leaf afloat on water,
days glide along the tides of time.'

278
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:38,042
'The moonlight showers upon the leaf
with intense heat.'

279
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:42,750
'You bruised me,
O beautiful one.'

280
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:47,625
'And you became erroneous,
O celestial cloud.'

281
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:52,083
'You arose as a wall at my door
and confined me within.'

282
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,625
Who is the special guest
for this music show?

283
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,917
We'll go with Harris or Vidyasagar
for the finals.

284
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,083
Please suggest someone
for this episode.

285
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,958
How about "Power Star" Srinivasan?
-Really?

286
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:39,958
What's he got to do with music?
-What's he got to do with cinema?

287
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:43,333
Please listen to me...
-This is my show. Don't ruin it.

288
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:46,917
Wonderful, Thilak.
We can really troll him.

289
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,958
I've been slaving away for years,
making movies...

290
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,000
...and you haven't awarded me yet.

291
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:05,958
But your lead actor will be nominated.
-Why do you give all the awards to him?

292
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:10,000
Pick me as Best Director,
and both my actors will perform on stage.

293
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,875
We will rock it.
-Who are you talking to, Bavana?

294
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,083
I'm with the jury that picks the winners.
If you try influencing my decision...

295
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,875
...I'll tell the press about it.

296
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,458
KV, Mr. Bhagyaraj is here!

297
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:27,500
He hung up.
Serves him right.

298
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,083
What a suck up!

299
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,167
What happened to Kalpana?

300
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:36,000
Why are you stopping us? Let us in!
-Get out of here!

301
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,583
Why won't you let us in?

302
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,833
We want to know what happened
to our friend!

303
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,542
She tried to kill herself
by jumping off a roof.

304
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:46,042
That's impossible!
She's an anti-suicide activist.

305
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,875
Please let us in.

306
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,667
We'll stop them, sir.
What's his name? Abdul?

307
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,333
Alright sir. I'll handle it.

308
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,917
Get these people out of here.

309
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,292
Leave!
-Seems to be a big problem.

310
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,625
I'm trying to be polite.
-Let me meet the doctor!

311
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,917
I won't go until I see him.
-Hands off the cops!

312
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:04,583
Get the hell out of here!

313
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:08,125
Let us go, sir!

314
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,750
Hey!
-Can you let us in now?

315
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:13,125
What are you doing?!
Take them to the Royapettah hospital.

316
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,000
Get in the van!

317
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:19,625
This guy Abdul cheated that Kalpana
and ruined her.

318
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,917
Poor girl!
She failed in love, and in suicide.

319
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:32,458
Mary 'chechi' ('sister' in Malayalam)...
-So, are all nurses manufactured in Kerala?

320
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:35,083
It's not 'Mary'.
It's 'Mariyamma'.

321
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:41,208
I'm sorry. There's a social activist
named Kalpana, who was admitted here.

322
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:44,125
I want to see her...
-Why the hell are you trying to bribe me?

323
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,167
Do I look like that kind of woman?
What the hell are you made of?

324
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,583
You and your stupid face!

325
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,292
Sorry, sister. Don't mistake us.

326
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:53,917
We're Kalpana's friends
and we're really worried about her.

327
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,500
Move aside, Ashok.

328
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,125
Sorry, ma'am. In times like this,
she'll need someone to talk to.

329
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,708
We need to see her.
Please help us. How is she now?

330
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:09,500
Poor girl has scratches all over her body.
It's as if she was torn apart by wolves.

331
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,875
How can one girl fight off so many people?

332
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,917
It's a miracle she survived.
-We need to see her. Please help us.

333
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:22,958
I'm taking a huge risk for you here.
Just do what I say.

334
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,083
That's an undercover cop.

335
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:30,708
One of the doctors just examined her.
She seems to have back pain.

336
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,000
Please see what's wrong.

337
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:51,875
I think it's a pelvic fracture.

338
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,292
We need to take an X-ray.
-Sure, doctor.

339
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,833
Stay here, ma'am.
We'll be back in five minutes.

340
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:01,250
Where are you taking her, nurse?
-To take an X-ray.

341
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:06,875
Wrap this up before the doctor comes back.
I'll return in ten minutes.

342
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,917
What happened Kalpana?
They're saying all kinds of things.

343
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,958
They're my colleagues from Zen1 TV.

344
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,958
They wanted to see how you are, too.

345
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,917
As far as you're concerned,
I'm just a news article, right?

346
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:30,792
Even now, you didn't come here
out of concern for me.

347
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,792
That's not true, Kalpana.

348
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,708
We came when we heard
that you tried to kill yourself.

349
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,417
Only after arriving
did we know of the real situation.

350
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:43,833
The cops are trying to cover this up.

351
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:47,542
Even now, they blamed your friend Abdul
for this, and took him away.

352
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,417
You won't get justice,
if you stay quiet.

353
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:00,042
We'll keep your name and face
out of this.

354
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:02,042
But we need to record your statement.

355
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:08,333
If you don't want to do it, that's okay.
We're here for you. So is our channel.

356
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,958
Stop. Turn off the camera.
-Why?

357
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:22,000
You don't have to face the camera.
Your voice is enough. Turn around.

358
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:28,375
What are you doing, Thilak?
She's agreed to show her face.

359
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,208
Why are you making her turn around?
Her face will boost up the ratings!

360
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,458
Shut up and do your work.

361
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,708
Come over here, Malar.
Let's roll, Ashok.

362
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:46,625
Our movement
is called 'Green Humanity'.

363
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,083
Our mission is to fight every crime
against nature.

364
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:56,083
A village called Kamangudi,
near Tiruvallur...

365
00:31:56,208 --> 00:32:01,167
...is being heavily polluted
by the 'Global Dragon' pesticide company.

366
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:06,875
A factory owned by Dheeran Maniarasu,
businessman and political bigwig.

367
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:12,042
We protested outside the factory,
to raise awareness about this problem.

368
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:19,125
There are many ways to disperse crowds.
Lathi charges. Arrests. Attacks from goons.

369
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:28,208
Beyond all this, the women who protest
are subjected to extreme humiliation.

370
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:31,917
Many have been sexually assaulted.

371
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:34,167
Bodily organs have been maimed.

372
00:32:35,917 --> 00:32:38,458
That day,
after Abdul dropped me home...

373
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,458
Come fast. Let's go.
-Shut the hell up, woman!

374
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:45,292
You like to protest
when nature gets ruined, eh?

375
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,875
We'll see who comes to protest
when you're ruined!

376
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,583
Don't let her get away!

377
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:15,375
"Shame me all you want."

378
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,500
"But you will have to answer
for every wound that befalls us."

379
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,917
"Try curbing one of us
and a hundred will rush to our defence."

380
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:28,208
"Sooner or later,
our resolve will conquer you."

381
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,500
"Despite your deception,
we will succeed."

382
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:35,375
In our society,
expectant parents want only a male child.

383
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,917
This is the very first crime against women.

384
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:42,458
This basic discrimination is the foundation
to every injustice faced by a woman.

385
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:45,875
Just recently,
to fight against the damage to nature...

386
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,625
...this lady protested outside
the factory owned by "Global Dragon".

387
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,167
Do her actions have anything to do
with the crime committed against her?

388
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:56,875
Despite her word that some savages
were responsible for this...

389
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,542
...why are the cops trying to cover it up,
by ruling it as a suicide attempt?

390
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,583
Who are those mongrels
who committed this horrendous crime?

391
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,500
Who do they work for?

392
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,000
It's not just this one woman.
Because of these heinous incidents...

393
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:14,250
...there are many,
who are ashamed to show their faces.

394
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:18,542
To those sisters who are forced to hide,
it is our duty to show them the way.

395
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:24,042
I don't know if we can feel their pain.
But at least, let us try to understand it.

396
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,708
Thank you.

397
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,333
You were just awesome.

398
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,250
In the two years we've been on air,
this is the best newscast.

399
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:54,500
Dheeran's on the line.
He's really angry.

400
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,792
Are you messing with me?

401
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:03,958
We're just broadcasting a statement
of a woman who was wronged.

402
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,917
What's she saying?
Why are you dragging me into this mess?

403
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:09,667
Was my company name
inscribed in the van she was raped in?

404
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,375
Enough with that crap!

405
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,042
Think you can give me soap
after slinging mud at me?

406
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:20,917
Think about it. You will need
our support during the election.

407
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:23,917
Many of my relationships
began with hostility.

408
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,917
But everything ended amicably.

409
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:31,167
First, retract the statement against me.
-We'll definitely do it.

410
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:34,083
But before that, let's talk over brunch.

411
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:38,750
'Bench'?
What are we? Lovers?

412
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:54,750
Is this a news channel
or a five-star hotel?

413
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:57,417
Now I understand why you won't work for me.

414
00:35:57,542 --> 00:35:59,625
So, how many film rights
do you want to sell?

415
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,542
156. Even if I sell all 350 films I own,
I can't pay off my debts.

416
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,958
But the lord is with me.
He won't let the righteous down.

417
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,375
And you want me to work for you!

418
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,667
Times change.
-He's the Managing Director.

419
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:19,708
Even if it has the biggest star,
no more than 8 crores on satellite rights.

420
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:21,875
Be very clear on that.
-Sit down.

421
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,333
If he signs now, it'll be 8.
If he's back tomorrow to bargain...

422
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,000
...I'll cut it down to 5 crores.

423
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,833
He's Mr. Mayilvahanan
from Muthamizh TV.

424
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,125
Mr. Pillai told me about you.

425
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,333
How many films did you say you have?
-156.

426
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:51,583
I can give you three crores.
-Sir, each film is an epic in itself.

427
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,250
Even if it's 5 lakhs per film,
it comes up to 7 crores.

428
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,250
Your offer is nowhere close to that.

429
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:02,708
Even three crores is a lot for this.
I don't know how I can use any of it.

430
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:06,583
This rotten trash can't be used
as either music or film.

431
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,417
What did you say?
"Rotten trash"?

432
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,917
Have you seen Tamil films, mister?

433
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,625
"Crap"?
Let me break it down to you.

434
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,250
'Listen up, my little boy.
Listen to what I have to say.'

435
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:31,125
'Pay close attention to my words.
You better pay attention to it.'

436
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,208
This song's from the film
'Arasilankumari'.

437
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:38,250
Who sang it? The pride of the masses,
the prince of the poor...

438
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:41,167
...the divine scholar,
the pristine king...

439
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:46,000
...and he who is one in a thousand people.
Do you know of the legendary M.G.R.?

440
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:49,542
I'm the only one
who has every single one of his films.

441
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:54,042
"The sky pours. The earth provides.
For what reason do I owe you taxes?"

442
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:58,125
"Did you work in our fields,
plant our crops, pull our weeds...

443
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:04,208
...irrigate our land,
or grind turmeric for our women?"

444
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:05,833
"Shameless fellow!"

445
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:08,667
This dialogue is from
'Veerapandiya Kattabomman'.

446
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:12,500
Who spoke it? A roaring lion,
a soaring eagle, a noble Tamilian...

447
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,667
...a majestic artist, a statue of virtue,
a fiery dynasty...

448
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:18,917
...a symbol of hope, a jewel of pride.
The greatest of all time.

449
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:23,375
The iconic Sivaji Ganesan.
Is this "rotten trash"?

450
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:28,542
Mr. Mayil, you're testing my patience.
-A celluloid demigod, an oratorical gem...

451
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:33,000
...armed with a sharp tongue,
he turned Tamil Nadu on its head.

452
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:35,417
Do you know anything about him?

453
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:38,458
Have you seen the film 'Chandralekha'
by Gemini S.S. Vasan?

454
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:42,833
The movie where hundreds of women
dance away on huge drums?

455
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:45,333
Have you seen it before
or do you want to see it now?

456
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:48,083
Let go of me, Pillai.

457
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,667
Once you see that dance,
you'll never forget it.

458
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:55,583
I'll give you a chance. Have a glance.
Then carry on with your silly dance.

459
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,583
Fight this,
and it'll get worse.

460
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:14,792
Hey mister, you might be a millionaire,
but you don't own an inch of my hair.

461
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:27,333
Listen up. 23 of my men are in jail
for rioting outside your office.

462
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:30,292
Now with this girl,
you're defaming me during the election.

463
00:39:30,417 --> 00:39:34,542
The press is relentlessly questioning me.
You said you'd fix this! What happened?

464
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:41,708
Other than your time of birth,
I can change everything else about you.

465
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,875
Mr. Pillai, do it.
-I'll add it to the next newscast.

466
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:54,708
Do you know the story of Saddam Hussein?

467
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,542
Script?
You want me to produce a film?

468
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:04,000
This is an incident from Iraq, sir.

469
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:07,958
Through a strategy called
'embedded journalism'...

470
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:13,667
...many media outlets convinced the world
that Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons...

471
00:40:13,792 --> 00:40:17,792
...which were a threat to world peace.

472
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,583
This induced fear among the public.

473
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:22,625
Several nations allied together.

474
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:27,250
They declared war against Iraq
and killed Saddam Hussein.

475
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:30,375
All of it was for oil.
Since then, there've been no traces...

476
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,833
...of a single nuclear weapon in Iraq.

477
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:35,125
When the media can rewrite history...

478
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,125
...it is child's play
to either boost or sink your image.

479
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:42,583
You're all talk, but no action.
-"Breaking News!"

480
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:47,250
"A few days ago, many individuals
associated with Dheeran Maniarasu..."

481
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:50,042
"...were arrested for rioting
outside our office."

482
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:53,583
"In a stunning turn of events,
new information has come to light."

483
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:57,625
"Take only the tomatoes and eggs.
Leave the weapons."

484
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,375
"Upon reviewing this footage,
it has been proved..."

485
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:07,250
"...that Dheeran's rivals staged this
to humiliate him and his party."

486
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:12,042
"The police are investigating
the true nature of the culprits..."

487
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:15,042
"...based on information
provided by Zen1 TV."

488
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:20,167
What kind of magic is this, Kalyan?
In one second, you changed everything!

489
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:24,417
You're a genius!
The media is so powerful!

490
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:28,625
Our research team has designed
some promotional strategies for you.

491
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:35,667
Your credibility with the public
is in the gutter.

492
00:41:35,792 --> 00:41:41,292
What are you saying? Just by batting an eye
I set social media on fire.

493
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,333
Won't these become votes tomorrow?

494
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,625
They're just trolling you.
None of it will become votes.

495
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,417
30% of the public see you as a clown.
25% of them see you as a rogue.

496
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:56,208
15% see you as an alcoholic.
We must change that.

497
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:59,958
Our personality branding
is a clinical process.

498
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,792
Like legalizing black money,
you'll be in the top news...

499
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:05,083
...at least once a week, on our channel.

500
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:08,125
We'll script a few incidents on our end
to get you there.

501
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,792
This will be further reflected
in our proxy media outlets and websites.

502
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:16,000
And your public image will simply soar.
-Alright. I'm in!

503
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:21,208
Take me as high as you can.
I'll make sure the money keeps pouring.

504
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:31,875
Put your hands together,
for Zen1 TV's 'All in All Extravaganza'!

505
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,250
Tamil Nadu's most innovative musical show!

506
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:37,917
Tonight, we have five finalists.

507
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:43,667
They're going to perform
new age covers of Bharathiar's music!

508
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:46,042
Would you like anything to eat?
-No, thank you.

509
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:09,167
'Gushing light, you are, to me.
Perceiving sight, I am, to you.'

510
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:12,833
'Flowing honey, you are, to me.
Dazed bee, I am, to you.'

511
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:16,542
'Words aren't enough
to describe your splendour.'

512
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:19,625
'Dazzling light of the heavens.
Oh, you balmy breeze.'

513
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:26,958
'Kannamma, my love!'

514
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:34,042
'Kannamma, my love!'

515
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:39,042
'Eternal love, you are, to me.
Enchanting pull, I am, to you.'

516
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:42,875
'Mystical knowledge, you are, to me.
Skillful mastery, I am, to you.'

517
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,542
'You are the brimming ecstasy
at the very end of enlightenment.'

518
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:50,167
'The embodiment of music.
Oh, you pleasing soul!'

519
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:57,125
'An ever playful boy.
Kannan!'

520
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:02,958
Put the chicken away.
You're on camera.

521
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:09,000
'A constant source of woe
to many a damsel.'

522
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:32,000
Do our judges know what they have to say?
-Let them say what they want to say.

523
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,583
What do you think
about their performance?

524
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,125
Amazing.
The idea is refreshingly new.

525
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,833
You guys rocked the stage.

526
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:45,583
Fantastic.

527
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:49,500
Don't simply praise them.
Spice it up with a bit of controversy.

528
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,542
Sure, will do.
You call that a song?

529
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:02,750
They were braying like donkeys.
Jumping around like monkeys.

530
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:04,792
Think you are dancing at a local funeral?

531
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:09,500
If one sings like this,
love will cease to exist.

532
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:12,958
Thank god the poet isn't alive
to witness this horror.

533
00:45:14,292 --> 00:45:16,708
Presenting to you, our special guest.

534
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,042
A man of smiles,
who goes many miles.

535
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:22,083
The one and only "Power Star".
A few words, sir.

536
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:25,500
What do I say?
-Tell us more about your doctorate title.

537
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,958
Sir, please talk about the performance.

538
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:34,667
It was fantastic. I was dazzled
by this rocking version of 'Bharathi'.

539
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,042
Sir, save this speech for another day.
This is no audio launch event.

540
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:42,833
Find a few faults.
Spruce it up a bit.

541
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,375
Just a small problem.

542
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,167
With your seat?
-No, with the beat.

543
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:52,458
The drummer is at fault.

544
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,875
The tempo was wrong.
-What?

545
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,750
Instead of setting it from six to four,
he went to three.

546
00:45:57,875 --> 00:46:00,833
The notes were a little faulty too.

547
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,375
But he managed it well.

548
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,292
What? Are you kidding me?

549
00:46:06,417 --> 00:46:09,958
Had any of the other judges said it,
I would've accepted it.

550
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,167
It's funny to hear you say it.

551
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:16,375
Funny, says the drummer!

552
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:21,583
He isn't at fault, says the drummer.
He is at fault, says Power Star.

553
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:25,125
Let's see who is right!
-Jagan, that's an interesting challenge.

554
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,375
Ask Power Star to play the drums.
-Challenge him to play a round.

555
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,417
You call yourself Power Star.
Do you really have it in you?

556
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:36,208
Oh! He's provoking the Death Star
by defying Power Star.

557
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:40,292
Why do I have to compete?
-Sir, be a sport and just play along.

558
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:41,917
It won't be a pretty sight.

559
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:47,167
Come on, sir. Go ahead.
-No, why do we need to do this?

560
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:48,625
We'll handle it in editing.

561
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,583
Hand him the sticks.

562
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,250
Look, his hands are trembling.
Capture it.

563
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,625
God, save me!

564
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,208
What is going to happen next?

565
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,167
You are a genius.
-You are too kind.

566
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:08,708
Please donât call me a genius.

567
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:13,833
Only as long as you see me as a buffoon,
will I be a hit with the public.

568
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:17,833
Don't ruin my career
by calling me a genius.

569
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:25,083
Still, fools don't always remain fools.
They might know a thing or two.

570
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:34,583
Next up, the Bombay Melody Girls.

571
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,917
Mr. Pillai, this is Lakshmi Mukund.

572
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:43,667
A branding expert
from the ABC Ad agency.

573
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,708
Ma'am, they look like dolls,
but they can't sing to save their lives.

574
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:58,042
They don't need to. Their costumes
and makeup have a far wider reach.

575
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:01,958
They aren't just show girls
but also showcases of commercial products.

576
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:06,333
Their performance is so poor.
They might get eliminated in this round.

577
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:14,958
These girls must reach the finals
if you intend to bag big brands.

578
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:19,958
Else you might have to settle
for run-of-the-mill brands.

579
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,875
Keep the CD ready.

580
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:59,875
'Kannamma, my beloved.'

581
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,042
'Kannamma...'

582
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:07,042
There is no lip sync.
-Don't look at the sync, look at the chick.

583
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:12,708
'Precious life, you are, to me.
Pulsating beat, I am, to you.'

584
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:16,542
'Immense wealth, you are, to me.
Endless reserve, I am, to you.'

585
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:20,333
'Eternal beauty.
Oh you all pervading radiance.'

586
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:23,958
'Your smile is akin to a blooming jasmine.
Oh you rush of joy.'

587
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:26,458
'An ever playful boy.'

588
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:30,792
Accept my apologies, my lord.
What was I even thinking?

589
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:32,542
You just turned the tide.

590
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:37,750
'Open Talk', a new talk show
is set to start with grandeur.

591
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:39,792
I'd like to discuss market prospects.

592
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:43,042
Who is the anchor?
-Mr. Pillai, show her the photos.

593
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:49,292
Looks like a guy
who performs at a circus.

594
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:51,333
Are we selecting a security guard?

595
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:57,125
I told you she wouldn't like any of them.

596
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,625
Why don't you rope in
some popular anchors?

597
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,375
We did try. No matter how much we offer,
they won't leave their channels.

598
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,792
I need someone young, bold
and knowledgeable.

599
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:10,333
Someone with a magnetic personality.

600
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:12,958
How about Thilak?

601
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:16,917
He is a sensible guy
but lacks clarity of speech.

602
00:51:17,042 --> 00:51:18,917
It's like he's constantly chewing gum.

603
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:24,250
He might not be sensational
but he is endearing and honest.

604
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:30,042
'Kannamma...'

605
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:33,792
'...my love.'

606
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:37,833
'Kannamma...'

607
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:41,250
'...my beloved,
my love.'

608
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,750
'Precious life, you are, to me.
Pulsating beat, I am, to you.'

609
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:49,583
'Immense wealth, you are, to me.
Endless reserve, I am, to you.'

610
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:53,250
'Eternal beauty.
Oh you all pervading radiance.'

611
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:56,458
'Your smile is akin to a blooming jasmine.
Oh you rush of joy!'

612
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:08,167
Thilak, his work is done.
Can you ask Power Star to leave?

613
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:11,000
Brief the judges about the elimination.

614
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:13,125
Ask the audience to break for lunch.

615
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:19,208
Bro, you rocked.
Thank you so much for accepting our invite.

616
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:23,375
Your work is done here.
- Already? What about the results?

617
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:28,292
Is it okay?
- No problem at all. You may leave.

618
00:53:30,042 --> 00:53:33,000
Fabulous. Fantastic. Amazing.

619
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:38,208
The performance was power packed.

620
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:43,792
Judges, please let us know if this team
is going to the next round.

621
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:46,500
Go ahead and declare it.
-Selection was tough.

622
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:52,083
The team to be eliminated
is Vanilla Folk Team.

623
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,542
You failed to use the lyrics of the poet
and tried to ride easy by rapping around.

624
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:02,792
Dancing like savages,
your performance lacked grace.

625
00:54:03,792 --> 00:54:07,750
And dear boy,
is this a gymnastics show?

626
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:12,250
We will improve ourselves.
We feel proud in performing before you all.

627
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,792
We'll do better next time.

628
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,917
Jagan, ask him to show some emotion!

629
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:20,958
They are scolding you. Don't grin.
Act like you're hurt.

630
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,875
They will show you in close-up.

631
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,500
They haven't said anything wrong.
Why should I cry?

632
00:54:25,625 --> 00:54:27,167
Let me come there.

633
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:32,500
Boy, if you lose,
you must cry.

634
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:35,583
Every one enjoyed our performance.
They applauded.

635
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:39,500
We don't consider this a failure.
Sorry but we don't feel like crying.

636
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:45,333
Look at the judges, okay?

637
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:51,667
What have you done?

638
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:54,125
Even his parents don't hit him.

639
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,125
Are you upset?
Then throw your instruments down...

640
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,250
...or throw the mike at the judges.

641
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:04,250
Do anything, but make it sensational.
-What? You want us throw the instruments?

642
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:07,875
Come on guys, let's leave.
Subu dear, please don't cry.

643
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:23,583
Thanks.
-For what?

644
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:27,250
Bringing Power Star on board
was the only real thing that happened.

645
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:31,250
Rest is just business.
And lies.

646
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,125
Are you free today?
-What do you mean by 'free'?

647
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:43,583
If you are free, we can...
-We can? What?

648
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,875
You want me to hang out with you
somewhere?

649
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,833
I felt like thanking you.
And I did. Thatâs all. Period!

650
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:54,375
Yet, this knight isn't going to giveth up.
Period!

651
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:01,917
At least a coffee at the canteen?
-Alright, come along.

652
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:05,000
Thilak, boss wants to see you.
-Sir, let me just have coffee.

653
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:06,375
A feast awaits you there.

654
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,458
I waited 3 years for this coffee.
-It would've gone cold by now.

655
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,708
Thilak, this is your best bet.
Don't screw it up.

656
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,708
Think of it as a show,
where you are the participant.

657
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:27,167
Look over there. That's Lakshmi.
Marketing head of ABC Ad agency.

658
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:28,583
She is playing the judge.

659
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:31,417
She will decide
if you are worth your salt.

660
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:48,333
Ma'am, he is Thilak,
the one I had mentioned earlier.

661
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:52,375
So Thilak, what is your idea
about a talk show?

662
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,875
What do you know about anchoring?

663
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,125
It's important for the anchor
to know the guest inside out.

664
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:05,667
An anchor can easily become a hero
by putting the guest in a spot.

665
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:08,958
But that's not the anchor's job.
-Should we make the guest a hero?

666
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:12,500
No, ma'am.
As per the ethics of journalism...

667
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:15,958
Don't bore me with your ethics theory.

668
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:24,583
Is journalism boring?
How can you say that?

669
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,542
Miss...?
Sir, is she a Miss or Mrs.?

670
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:29,167
Just give it a miss!

671
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:36,125
How can consumer products dictate
the proceedings of a current affairs show?

672
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,333
How can the market decide the concept?

673
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:43,458
Should media be a slave
to a soap company?

674
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:46,083
Is media your slave?
-Slave? I never said that.

675
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:50,583
It's not just my question.
The nation wants to know.

676
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:51,875
The nation is erupting!

677
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,417
It's a social anger of the moral fibre
of the Indian middle class society.

678
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:57,292
You have insulted the middle class.

679
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,542
Never ever interfere me
when I'm talking.

680
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:04,542
Listen to me, Lakshmi!

681
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,208
This is one way
to host a talk show.

682
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:13,375
Now for the other version?

683
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Hello Lakshmi.
It's a dream to have you on our show.

684
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:20,583
ABC agency is a leading marketing giant.

685
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:22,792
As their employee,
you would be very busy.

686
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:28,542
Setting all that aside, you came here
to personally find the right anchor...

687
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:34,208
...and decide the content of the show.
You're gladly shouldering our burden.

688
00:58:34,333 --> 00:58:39,375
Can you tell us how you acquired
such a sense of responsibility?

689
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,167
This is another way to ask questions.

690
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:47,667
One who thinks questions are important
raises his voice.

691
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:50,000
One who is looking for answers
speaks gently.

692
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:02,458
See if he would fit the bill?
-Sir, it's all done.

693
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:09,000
Already? What exactly did you do
to impress her?

694
00:59:09,125 --> 00:59:13,417
Just a sample, sir.
-Let's have Dheeran as our first guest.

695
00:59:13,542 --> 00:59:15,083
It will be a glorious start.

696
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:26,458
Mr. Dheeran, are you trying
to ignore the elephant in the room?

697
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:29,708
There has been a case registered
against you for torching a bus.

698
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:32,542
Do you or do you not accept your mistake?
-Hey!

699
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:36,875
Don't say a word.
Do you accept your mistakes or not?

700
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,083
The only mistake I committed in 1989
is giving birth to you.

701
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:44,875
Let's resume
after a short commercial break.

702
00:59:58,083 --> 01:00:01,750
He was jailed for selling illicit liquor.
But the year of arrest is unknown.

703
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:03,833
That information is crucial.
Dig deeper.

704
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:07,625
Most of his wealth is in his wife's name.
Her name means 'lucky'.

705
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:11,875
He is indeed lucky to have a wife
who doesn't mind his many concubines.

706
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,833
But look how unlucky this guy is.

707
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,750
He was trying to deliver
an Oscar-winning performance.

708
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:20,708
He kissed
only because of his commitment to the role.

709
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:24,750
Is that even a mistake?
Does that warrant a breakup?

710
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:28,458
Dude, don't screw this up for me.

711
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,708
I just convinced her
to have coffee with me.

712
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,917
Coffee?
What do you mean?

713
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:37,958
Despite having a feast every day,
you weren't satisfied.

714
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:49,375
"According to recently obtained reports,
Kalpana is mentally unstable."

715
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,583
"Presenting to you,
Kalpana's parents."

716
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:54,583
"My daughter isn't mentally stable."

717
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:56,792
"It's been the case
for the last four years."

718
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:59,167
"I think it has aggravated now."

719
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:04,833
"She hallucinated that someone
stalked and violated her, that day..."

720
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:07,167
"...which made her jump off a moving taxi."

721
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:13,750
"Our daughter hasn't been raped."

722
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:16,375
"The fault lies with our daughter."

723
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,625
"Kalpana is a schizophrenic patient."

724
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,958
"She just visualized of being stalked
and sexually violated."

725
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:24,625
"It is all a figment of her imagination."

726
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:29,667
"It is dangerous to release her outside.
She should be cared for in an asylum."

727
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:34,250
"Thereby, we confirm that Ms. Kalpana
wasn't subjected to any violence."

728
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:39,875
"We apologize for airing false news..."
-How can they put her face on air?

729
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,125
Kalpana is currently undergoing treatment.

730
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,458
When was this shot taken?

731
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:04,750
No, Thilak, don't do anything now.
-Let go of me.

732
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:08,375
Where do you think you are going?
Thilak, please wait.

733
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,292
Let's talk about it later.
It's getting late for your show.

734
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:13,458
I'm not interested in the interview.

735
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:15,375
I'm going to bash Ashok up.

736
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:20,375
Did you think about Kalpana's situation?
-Thilak, calm down and listen to me.

737
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,375
Would bashing Ashok change anything?

738
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:29,208
Calm down and consider what I just said.
-She trusted me.

739
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,208
Ashok has branded her a lunatic.

740
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:34,125
You have known Kalpana for a week.

741
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,833
I have known her for six years.
Do you think I'm not upset or angry?

742
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:40,042
We haven't cheated anyone.

743
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:43,417
Please understand! As a media person,
one has to face many problems.

744
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:46,458
If you take all of it personally,
you can never be at peace.

745
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:48,000
You won't be able to work.

746
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:54,250
Politics has played a role in this issue.
And, our channel is an accomplice to this.

747
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,250
You do realize that,
don't you?

748
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:58,792
How do you expect me to be
a mute spectator?

749
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:02,083
What are you going to do now?
Who are you to question this?

750
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:05,833
What does that have to do with this?
-Do you have any standing in the media?

751
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:09,250
If you want to make a difference,
you must first reach a certain level.

752
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:11,958
You need to become a respectable anchor.

753
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:14,833
Until you prove your worth,
the world won't respect you.

754
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:20,708
Your chance to soar high
is waiting at your doorstep.

755
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:23,458
We have your back. Alright?

756
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:26,792
The spotlight that shines on you today
will pave the way forward.

757
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:34,875
Not just in your dreams,
I will be there with you forever.

758
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:02,750
Hello sir!

759
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:06,042
You changed the entire story, Ashok!
-It's nothing new to us, sir.

760
01:04:06,167 --> 01:04:10,000
How long should I wait for you?
Why are you late?

761
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:13,708
Thilak, in that case of 100 deaths
due to illicit liquor supply...

762
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:16,250
...Maniarasu was arrested in 2004,
at Dharmapuri.

763
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:24,875
Stick with the questions
prepared by our research team. Got it?

764
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,583
I'll talk you through this segment.
Keep this, Malar. Don't confuse him.

765
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:33,542
"Upon watching a peacock dance..."

766
01:04:33,667 --> 01:04:36,583
This way, sir.
-This language is way too classical.

767
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:39,792
Don't worry. If you forget,
I'll prompt you through the earpiece.

768
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:43,042
Please give me that cheat sheet.
-Can you hear me, Thilak?

769
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:46,667
Hurry!
-Bavana, these questions are ridiculous!

770
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:50,500
Stick with those questions.
-It's time, Malar.

771
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,917
That's enough, sir!

772
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:01,208
Start with a respectful greeting.
Not too formal.

773
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:06,167
Try it once. Let's check the audio.
-Greetings, honourable sir!

774
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:09,500
This is way too much.
Be serious! Do it properly.

775
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:15,583
Welcome. Hello sir!
-Hello, my friend.

776
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:18,417
You don't need an introduction, sir.

777
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:22,625
People sing your praises every day
on social media.

778
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,083
An eminent politician and industrialist.

779
01:05:25,208 --> 01:05:27,875
Why don't you introduce yourself
in three sentences?

780
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,667
I'm Dheeran Maniarasu!
Public service is my life's purpose!

781
01:05:32,792 --> 01:05:34,917
I walk the path of truth and honesty.

782
01:05:35,042 --> 01:05:37,875
According to a proverb
in my ancestral home...

783
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,917
...there are no virgin mothers
or honest politicians.

784
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:45,958
What are you saying?
-Your introduction has proved that wrong.

785
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:57,625
You got the prefix 'Dheeran'
due to a valiant act, isn't it, sir?

786
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:01,583
This question should be asked boldly!
Don't be afraid.

787
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:06,625
Fifteen years ago, the government opened
several liquor shops in my town.

788
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,292
Every family suffered!

789
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:12,500
I couldn't just stand by
and watch the poor endure this pain.

790
01:06:12,625 --> 01:06:16,208
That's why I led a protest
to shut these shops down.

791
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:20,875
Back in 2004, due to this liquor issue,
didn't they arrest you in Dharmapuri?

792
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,542
You idiot! What are you doing?
-It happened in Dharmapuri, right?

793
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:31,458
Yes, I protested against
all kinds of alcohol, in Dharmapuri!

794
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:35,167
I endured a lot of physical abuse,
pain, suffering, and resistance.

795
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:37,875
Resistance, is it?
Who resisted whom?

796
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:42,625
The government.
They tried to assault and deter me.

797
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:49,500
I should've died from all that gunfire.
Look at these wounds!

798
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:53,917
That's enough, sir. Children are watching.
Cover up those wounds.

799
01:06:54,042 --> 01:06:55,542
I have a lot more scars in my body.

800
01:06:55,667 --> 01:07:01,125
On noticing my resolve, our leader,
Tamizhselvan, praised me a lot.

801
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,917
To ensure his words remain etched
in people's minds...

802
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:08,375
...he named me "Dheeran Maniarasu".
This was truly historic, my friend.

803
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,125
Truly historic, yes.
Worthy of being engraved in stone!

804
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:14,458
He's trolling him splendidly.
-Stop teasing him!

805
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:18,875
Shall we talk about your contribution
to education?

806
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,042
With three engineering colleges,
two medical colleges...

807
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:25,167
...you promote higher learning
among students.

808
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:32,083
That's about it.
-What about Abdul Kalaam?

809
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:33,917
Did you say "ape", sir?

810
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:38,458
You were going to compare me
with the great Mr. Abdul Kalaam?

811
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:40,333
He is an inspiration to me.

812
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:45,208
I promote education among the youth,
to support his vision of progress.

813
01:07:45,333 --> 01:07:47,667
When and why did you leave
your first party?

814
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:50,875
Listen up. He'll start with
"Upon watching a peacock dance..."

815
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:55,125
"Upon watching a peacock dance..."
-How did you know that?

816
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,792
"...a turkey yearns to upstage it."
-I wrote it.

817
01:07:57,917 --> 01:08:00,458
Have you heard that verse?
This is just like that.

818
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:02,833
Lovely poem!
'Purananooru' or 'Agananooru'?

819
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:07,667
Sir, it's 'Purananooru'.
-Of course, it's the one about 400 birds!

820
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,042
Awesome! Please do it again.
-'400 birds'.

821
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:12,542
'400 birds' indeed!
-Just like that, my friend...

822
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:16,833
...out of jealousy over my friendship
with the leader, some tried to ruin me.

823
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:20,000
So, I left them.
-Did you leave or did they kick you out?

824
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:24,000
If you provoke him,
you can kiss your career goodbye.

825
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:27,042
"Kick me out"? I walked out!
-Ask him about his titles.

826
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:32,333
'The guiding light of the poor',
'The anchor of the youth'...

827
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:36,500
...'The eighth wonder of the world',
and 'The guardian of progress'.

828
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:38,583
You have many more revered titles.

829
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:42,083
Which is your favourite?
-My friend, you left out my doctorate!

830
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,208
I'm sorry, doctor.

831
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:47,500
Though I have so many titles,
'Protector of the poor', is my favourite.

832
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:50,458
Announce a commercial break.

833
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:54,333
Stay tuned for more excitement
after a short commercial break.

834
01:08:55,417 --> 01:09:00,042
Hey kid! Why are you switching
the order of the questions?

835
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:03,417
How can I respond properly
if they're not in sequence?

836
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:06,750
Here you go, sir!

837
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:12,750
Why are you asking unnecessary questions?
Stick to the list.

838
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:15,417
Don't digress.

839
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:18,500
For goodness sake, look cheerful!

840
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:25,333
Have some water.
-Talk without looking at the cue cards.

841
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:29,542
They think I'm like the equipment here,
to turn on or off at the flick of a switch.

842
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:33,042
Put Thilak on the phone.

843
01:09:34,792 --> 01:09:36,417
Put him on the line!
-It's alright.

844
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:46,375
You traitor!
I told her not to trust the media.

845
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,292
She didn't believe me.
Is this what you call 'journalism'?

846
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:53,292
You're mistaken, Abdul.
-It may as well be prostitution!

847
01:09:53,417 --> 01:09:56,500
Please listen to me, Abdul.
-Aren't you ashamed?

848
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:59,750
Give me that.
-What are you going to say to him?

849
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,208
Brother...
-Please listen to me, Kalpana...

850
01:10:02,333 --> 01:10:06,375
You said my face wasn't necessary
and I needn't worry.

851
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:10,292
You assured me of your support,
as well as that of your channel.

852
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:18,708
Why did your channel brand me a lunatic
and humiliate me like this?

853
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:21,625
They threatened my parents
and made them tell lies.

854
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:25,333
My hands are heavily tied, Kalpana...
-No! Let me finish what I have to say.

855
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:30,042
Weren't you the one who told me
that if I stayed quiet...

856
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:33,750
...I wouldn't get justice?
Didn't you make me tell my story?

857
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:38,333
When it's time for you to tell the truth,
you choose to stay quiet and nod along.

858
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:43,250
I truly feel like a lunatic, now!

859
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:52,042
The people who assaulted me that day
were evil to begin with.

860
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:56,500
But you came along
like a virtuous man...

861
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,833
Disconnect the call!

862
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:08,833
Why are you on the phone now?

863
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:13,417
Just focus on the show! Understand?

864
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:19,333
Just follow the cue cards
and my voice on your earpiece.

865
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:32,458
Ask him about his upcoming initiatives.
Be more cheerful.

866
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:36,750
Speak to him with respect,
and more importantly, bolster his image.

867
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:42,125
Mr. 'Theechatti' Mannar?
-What?

868
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,375
What did you say?
-Isn't that your real name?

869
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,125
Weren't you born after your mom
appeased God with a fire pot...

870
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,917
...following years of childlessness?

871
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:58,792
Who told you that?
-Saroja, your concubine.

872
01:11:58,917 --> 01:12:01,417
Head of the women's division.
-Way to mess with him.

873
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:03,625
Don't be shy.
The whole city knows about it.

874
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:08,708
Our distinguished guest
started as an auto driver at 15...

875
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:13,375
...and became the auto union boss at 23.
After that, he joined a political party...

876
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,833
...burned down a bus, and was renamed
as 'Dheeran' Maniarasu.

877
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:22,583
After that, he saw nothing but growth.
With profits from unethical means...

878
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:24,208
...he set up 6 colleges...

879
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:26,417
...and several theatres under his name...

880
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,958
...as well as that of his family
and several proxies, right?

881
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:33,333
And in collaboration with China,
you set up a pesticide factory.

882
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:41,750
How did you grow from an auto driver
to a powerful industrialist?

883
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:44,958
You summed it all up in a few seconds.
My journey was far from easy.

884
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:47,625
I endured humiliations,
cruelties, and wounds...

885
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:52,000
You left out riots, betrayals,
and sexual assaults.

886
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:55,458
What the hell are you talking about?

887
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:58,708
Why are trying to mimic Raghuvaran
from the film 'Mudhalvan'?

888
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:03,833
Mr. Mannar, I was only referring
to the stepping stones you demolished.

889
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:07,500
Do you follow me?
Can I refresh your memory?

890
01:13:07,625 --> 01:13:11,917
A few days ago, didn't a youth movement,
named 'Green Humanity'...

891
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:16,083
...protest the ecological damage done
by your company, outside your office?

892
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:18,042
Look at what he's doing!

893
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:21,125
Didn't you try dispersing them
with physical force?

894
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:26,583
Didn't you have a few rogues
brutally violate one of its women?

895
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:29,958
Does any of that ring a bell?
-This is such a load of crap!

896
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:32,500
Mr. Mannar,
I haven't gotten to my questions yet.

897
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:38,333
What questions? "Who was I born to"?
"Who are my kids?" Is it relevant to you?

898
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:41,417
Do we stop this?
-Let it record. It'll be useful later.

899
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,000
Go for a commercial break.

900
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:45,000
You know what I've done to get this far?

901
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:51,708
Just one stage. 500 rupees per person.
I'll kill you, and take this channel out!

902
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:54,000
Your words brim with passion, sir.

903
01:13:57,792 --> 01:14:01,625
Relax. I'm just getting warmed up.

904
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,708
A statement from Abdul
about your death threat to him.

905
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:08,250
Listen up.
-"We won't stop until we stop you".

906
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:09,833
For the audience.

907
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:12,125
"You're threatening me
in the name of truce?"

908
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,167
"I called you not for a truce,
but to rip your throat out."

909
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:19,250
"Was defiling your friend Kalpana
not good enough for you?"

910
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:20,833
Give me that!

911
01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:23,792
Please calm down!
-That's not even my voice.

912
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,708
You used someone to mimic me.
Who's Kalpana? Who's Abdul?

913
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:29,333
What protest do you mean?
What crap is this?

914
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:32,375
Please cool down.
-Don't worry, sir. We've cut to break.

915
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,208
Nothing here will be telecast.

916
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:40,000
What are you doing?
-What the hell do you think I'm doing?

917
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:42,583
Turn off the camera
or I'll kill you.

918
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:45,875
Obviously when there's manufacturing,
there will be waste.

919
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,958
Don't you take a dump
before going to work?

920
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:52,542
Has anyone died because of that dump?
Do you have a list of victims?

921
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:57,042
Hold on for a second.
I only said there was ecological damage.

922
01:14:57,167 --> 01:14:59,750
Did people die?
So many that it warrants a list?

923
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,333
Shut the hell up!

924
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:05,250
Who the hell do you think you are?

925
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,792
Think you can humiliate me like this?
I'll kill you!

926
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:11,708
Did you record all of that?
-Some of it was off-camera.

927
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:13,750
Make sure you get all of this.
-Will do.

928
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:19,375
Let's assume you're innocent.
If you are, why are you getting angry?

929
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,250
Why are you sweating profusely?
It's all true, isn't it?

930
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:23,833
You know nothing about me!

931
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:28,583
You're hitting me for this question?
I've got a whole lot more for you!

932
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:32,375
Haven't you had enough?
You actually want more?

933
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,833
Oh no! Your dhoti is unravelling.
Did you trip and fall, sir?

934
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:43,417
Be careful, sir.
It might affect your blood pressure!

935
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:45,917
Or you might get a stroke!
Go and re-tie your dhoti.

936
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,417
Find your mini-bottle of booze
lying over there.

937
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:52,000
Take good care of yourself.
-Come with us, Thilak!

938
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,042
Take it easy on yourself, okay?

939
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:58,667
Your dhoti...
-Get out of here!

940
01:15:58,792 --> 01:16:01,042
Did you get all of that?
-Are you okay, dude?

941
01:16:03,042 --> 01:16:06,792
Don't tend to my wounds, my dear.
These are your prince's scars of victory.

942
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:09,417
Are you impressed?

943
01:16:09,542 --> 01:16:12,125
The more he struck you,
the more truth came to light.

944
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:16,458
I've seen heroes who kick ass in style.
Never one who gets his ass kicked in style!

945
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,083
Yeah, I'm no stranger to it.

946
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,958
Write down what I tell you.

947
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:26,625
Do your mimicry in the spots
that I tell you to.

948
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:29,458
Move aside!
Get down here, scumbag!

949
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:35,458
Think you can humiliate me on air?
-None of it was broadcast.

950
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:38,500
Is this what I pay you for?
-The public didn't see any of this.

951
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:41,042
We can fix all of this.
-What the hell can you fix?

952
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:47,125
Speak what's written here.
Make-up, freshen him up!

953
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,458
Just say this on air.
-Get him a fresh shirt!

954
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:53,708
We'll take care of the rest.
There's no problem.

955
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:55,292
Quickly give him the shirt.

956
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,000
The break ends in 20 seconds.

957
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:01,583
Get me old shots of Thilak.

958
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:03,833
Please come and sit down, sir.

959
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,750
Crop in the older footage with Thilak
and match it.

960
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:21,000
Quickly dub this in Thilak's voice.

961
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:26,500
Your hands are spotless.
-Tighten up the shot.

962
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:30,167
No one can know that Thilak isn't there.
Just keep him in the frame.

963
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,708
They're back on air.

964
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:36,333
"Your hands are spotless."
-How are they doing this?

965
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,875
"You always walk the path
of righteousness."

966
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,375
"Shouldn't the people know that?
The accusations against you are false."

967
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,833
"We know that.
Don't people need to know too?"

968
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:50,458
"That's why I asked such severe questions.
Please don't be offended."

969
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:54,292
My friend, the successful ones
are always targeted.

970
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:57,333
We can't let it drag us down.
-Crop Thilak into the wide shot.

971
01:17:57,458 --> 01:18:01,125
It took five years to fix my public image.

972
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:04,875
This poor girl was made a scapegoat
by my rivals, to take revenge on me.

973
01:18:06,042 --> 01:18:09,000
That makes me real sad.
-There's no "Greetings" from Thilak.

974
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:12,333
It won't be natural without it.
We'll end with Dheeran signing off?

975
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:17,375
He would've said it during the sound check.
Clip it from there.

976
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,125
Thank goodness you proved this to be false.

977
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:26,458
Thanks for letting me reinforce
my honesty, virtuousness, and nobility.

978
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:30,708
He altered the voice completely!

979
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:36,000
Awesome! Tell them I'm on my way.
With a lot of booze. We'll party all night!

980
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:42,208
Stay out of my way!
-You'll pay for this!

981
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,625
Why the hell did you do this?

982
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:49,417
Please stay out of my way, Malar!

983
01:18:49,542 --> 01:18:51,417
You street dog!
-You're the bloody dog!

984
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,000
Stop it, Thilak!

985
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:57,958
You filthy traitor!

986
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:06,417
Stop him!
-Get away from me!

987
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:10,500
Stop it!
-Out of my way, hag!

988
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:16,167
You thought I'm a pushover?

989
01:19:24,417 --> 01:19:26,625
You're dead meat, loser!

990
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:33,625
Would you do this to your sister?

991
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:47,625
You're branding rotten fish
as fresh and selling it.

992
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,000
Who is Dheeran Maniarasu?

993
01:19:49,125 --> 01:19:51,500
A womanizer. An alcoholic. A murderer.

994
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:53,917
And you want me to compare him
to Abdul Kalaam?

995
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:04,292
Do you have any idea
what prime time is all about?

996
01:20:04,417 --> 01:20:08,625
The time when folks spice up their dinner
by turning on their television!

997
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:12,708
The programming content in this block
must be extremely sensational!

998
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:16,167
As per company policy,
they must generate a ton of money.

999
01:20:16,292 --> 01:20:18,458
This wasn't what we planned for our show.

1000
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:21,958
You got rid of the regional team
who were great, in the very first show!

1001
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:25,667
Do people buy HD television sets
to watch these regional buffoons?

1002
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:29,375
On top of that,
that team didn't have even a single girl!

1003
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,500
Even if a man
can do a million tricks...

1004
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:34,667
...viewership rises only
when a beautiful girl can do the same!

1005
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:40,458
You're asking us to lie. We're asking you
to sensationally tell the truth.

1006
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:44,042
You saw how we covered
Kalpana's rape case, didn't you?

1007
01:20:44,167 --> 01:20:46,792
That day, we topped the ratings.

1008
01:20:46,917 --> 01:20:51,500
Don't you feel ashamed?
Even her attackers assaulted her only once.

1009
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:54,458
In the name of news,
you have assaulted her a million times!

1010
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:57,042
You got something to say to me?

1011
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:00,667
Good thing you don't have
the assault footage.

1012
01:21:00,792 --> 01:21:03,625
If you had that,
you would've aired it over and over again!

1013
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,583
That's enough out of you!

1014
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:13,458
If someone had killed your parents
or sexually assaulted your friends here...

1015
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:15,500
...you'd be the only one
shocked and sad.

1016
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:18,083
To me, it is news.
The best kind of news!

1017
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:27,333
Die, you sleaze ball!

1018
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:38,333
Don't let me fall, Thilak!
-If I do, you'll be the hottest news story.

1019
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:42,167
Have a nice death.

1020
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:00,167
Why are you laughing?

1021
01:22:00,292 --> 01:22:05,792
I imagined a terrific news story
involving you. It was hilarious.

1022
01:22:05,917 --> 01:22:08,417
Too bad you wouldn't have been around
to see it.

1023
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:14,042
That's what we're saying.

1024
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:17,083
Don't assume viewers are fools
and play with their emotions.

1025
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:19,625
They trust you now.
Almost blindly.

1026
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:24,667
Millions enjoy watching us.
They feel like they're in here, with us.

1027
01:22:24,792 --> 01:22:28,875
Sensational dramas. Questions raised.
Wins and losses in music shows.

1028
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,333
Every applause. Every teardrop.
Everything. They believe all of it.

1029
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:34,417
Their trust is our biggest asset.

1030
01:22:34,542 --> 01:22:40,042
The second you betray that,
they'll just change channels and move on.

1031
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:42,792
Our people tend to doze off a lot.

1032
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:44,875
But when it's time,
they wake up.

1033
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:50,000
And when they do,
you're finished.

1034
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:56,125
I'm fired. Is that right?
-Do you know who you're talking to?

1035
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:57,917
Get lost!

1036
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:04,250
Go ahead, Kalyan.
-No company in India will hire any of you.

1037
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:06,958
Let's not rush to this decision, sir.

1038
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:11,125
If you take their side, Mr. Pillai,
you can walk out with them.

1039
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,917
But I've been here since...
-How does this concern you?

1040
01:23:14,042 --> 01:23:16,375
Just do your job, and only that, sir.

1041
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,500
Oppose me and you...
-Excuse me, sir!

1042
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:26,042
Tell him we'd rather wash cups
in a tea stall than work for this creature!

1043
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,750
I'll see you when I see you.

1044
01:23:48,292 --> 01:23:53,708
Dude, all the channels are eagerly waiting
to give us dismissal orders.

1045
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:57,292
Thanks to Kalyan,
we've all been blacklisted.

1046
01:23:57,417 --> 01:23:58,875
The last sip is mine!

1047
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:03,583
Look!
It's that clown who screwed us.

1048
01:24:03,708 --> 01:24:08,000
He screwed you.
And you screwed us all.

1049
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:11,542
I can't beat you up.
Let me at least bash him.

1050
01:24:11,667 --> 01:24:14,625
Someone might get hurt.
On top of it, you threw away our booze.

1051
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:17,167
That's enough.
You and your social service!

1052
01:24:20,042 --> 01:24:22,125
What's happening here?
Any problem?

1053
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:27,125
Uncle, all the shops are shut.
Where can we get chilled beer?

1054
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:31,333
It isn't safe here.
And you're out with a bunch of drunkards.

1055
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:34,792
What if someone harms you?
-Don't worry, uncle.

1056
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:39,208
No one can do them more harm than us.
With friends like us, who needs enemies?

1057
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:42,417
Hey Thilak, doesn't he remind you
of someone?

1058
01:24:42,542 --> 01:24:45,458
Doesn't he look like the cook
from the film "Avvai Shanmugi"?

1059
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:47,250
They both have the same nose!

1060
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:50,000
Uncle, we are really sorry.
Doggie, take care of uncle.

1061
01:24:50,125 --> 01:24:52,542
Cops may nab you
for walking the dog at this hour!

1062
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:56,333
Why are you staggering?
Had too much to drink?

1063
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:03,833
Isn't it fishy? He's dressed like that
to take his dog for a leak at this hour.

1064
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:10,208
They are trying to kill us.
-He's driving like a lunatic.

1065
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:14,083
Dude, Kalyan is trying to get us killed.

1066
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:19,125
If you walk in the middle of the road,
will the lorry ply on the platform?

1067
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,667
Don't rattle me, Malar.
My bladder is full!

1068
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:25,750
Girls, donât peep in.
It is a cardinal sin.

1069
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:29,583
You drunkard,
you are such a disgrace to men.

1070
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:37,875
He's wasted. I have got to save him.
You guys wait right here.

1071
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:45,250
Our life is all dried up
and you're wetting his poster!

1072
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:47,208
Why do you think this toilet is here?

1073
01:25:47,333 --> 01:25:49,042
But, this pup is keeping me company.

1074
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:56,667
Nishanti and Malar, come here
and have a look at this opening.

1075
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:59,958
I'm going to whip his butt.
-Why is she pelting stones?

1076
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:01,833
Just come and have a look at this.

1077
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:07,417
Dude, look there is a job opening.
-'Facing setbacks? Don't worry.'

1078
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:11,625
'To perform at your best,
contact Muthamizh TV.'

1079
01:26:16,917 --> 01:26:20,875
It's a Tamil channel that has rescued us!
-Where is the interview happening?

1080
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:25,708
Maid, where is the receptionist?

1081
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:28,542
Why is she giving me a dirty look?

1082
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,125
What kind of channel is this?
-Discovery.

1083
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,500
True that.
Look, a hippo!

1084
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:40,500
What do you want?
-Whoa, the maid is the madam!

1085
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:43,458
We are here for the interview.
-Please be seated.

1086
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:46,167
Pushpa, is there anyone who fits the bill?
No, not you.

1087
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:51,083
No girls please.
And you look way too healthy.

1088
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,958
Doesn't he seem right for the part?
-He fits it to a T.

1089
01:26:59,792 --> 01:27:02,458
Wow! Your interview room looks
as fancy as a studio.

1090
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:05,542
Remain seated
and answer all their questions.

1091
01:27:06,792 --> 01:27:14,375
Welcome.
-Here is my resume and other particulars.

1092
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:18,583
Please tell us about the setbacks
you've endured.

1093
01:27:19,708 --> 01:27:25,458
We are a group of 6 - 3 boys and 3 girls.
We worked together day and night.

1094
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:28,083
Okay, we get it.
Remove your shirt and lie down here.

1095
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:33,250
What kind of a job
requires me to remove my shirt?

1096
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:37,958
We'll diagnose all your problems
and prescribe you this medicine.

1097
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:42,417
Just have two spoons of this medicine
and see all your problems melt away.

1098
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:47,042
Oh, it's that kind of a place!
-Remain seated.

1099
01:27:47,167 --> 01:27:49,375
Get off me, you pest!
I'll break your teeth.

1100
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,000
'Facing setbacks?'
The same poster from last night!

1101
01:27:57,875 --> 01:28:00,833
Dude, they are trying to use me
to sell male potency pills.

1102
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:02,958
We got duped by the words.

1103
01:28:03,083 --> 01:28:05,875
They aren't talking about setbacks
at work, but in bed.

1104
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,250
It is a sham of a show.
And they are all quacks.

1105
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:11,250
Who are you calling a quack?

1106
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:15,458
Master, this reptilian guy
walked out of the show midway.

1107
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,292
Sorry, we misunderstood.

1108
01:28:19,292 --> 01:28:20,917
We have a lot of media experience.

1109
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,708
It will be very useful
if you recruit us in your programming team.

1110
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:28,125
You guys are looking for a job?
-Yes, sir.

1111
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:32,000
I'm in no position to hire anyone.

1112
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:36,917
You may try selling these medicines.
You can make 50 per piece.

1113
01:28:37,042 --> 01:28:38,708
I have nothing else to offer.

1114
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:42,833
Have you acquired a broadcasting license
just to sell these bottles?

1115
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:45,208
Isn't this a sham?
-You call this a sham?

1116
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:51,167
Stress and tension are everywhere
except where they are supposed to be.

1117
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:53,167
Don't we need a solution for this?

1118
01:28:53,292 --> 01:28:56,792
Tamilians were once
the forerunners in medicine.

1119
01:28:56,917 --> 01:28:59,500
But today, some are scrawny like you.

1120
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:00,958
I mean no offense, sir.

1121
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:06,000
The world is torn apart by many problems.

1122
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:09,083
Leaving all that aside,
you seem focused on marital issues.

1123
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,333
Not bad, you seem to have a point.

1124
01:29:12,417 --> 01:29:15,958
The scientist who explored space...
The sage who enlightened the soul...

1125
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:19,250
Know what our very own Dr. Abdul Kalaam
had to say about world peace?

1126
01:29:19,375 --> 01:29:22,708
What did he say?
-Harmony at home equals an orderly nation.

1127
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:25,875
When there is order in the nation,
there is peace in the world.

1128
01:29:27,167 --> 01:29:30,250
Sir, it sounds great.
But I don't understand a word.

1129
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:32,625
Please translate.

1130
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:34,958
I'll explain it in a way
you best understand.

1131
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,417
A happy marriage leads to a happy home...

1132
01:29:37,542 --> 01:29:40,458
...which leads to a peaceful country
and a peaceful world.

1133
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:41,750
How is it?

1134
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:47,042
Sir, you are amazing.
I have decided to work for you.

1135
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:50,250
I have decided too.
There is no way I'm going to hire you.

1136
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:51,917
See you, sonny!

1137
01:29:52,042 --> 01:29:53,875
Who turned on these lights?

1138
01:29:54,167 --> 01:29:58,458
Just looking at the electricity bill
is enough to give you a shock.

1139
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:03,875
Sir, tell us where the HR room is.
We can initiate the joining formalities.

1140
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,042
Do you even know
what you're saying?

1141
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:09,625
I'm waiting for someone
to offer me a good deal for this channel.

1142
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:14,208
My job is like a boat caught in a storm.
So, don't get me started.

1143
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:16,083
We can be the oars in your boat.

1144
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,708
All I do here are chores.
We don't need any more oars.

1145
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:25,875
You have offered refuge to animals.
Won't you offer us a small space?

1146
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,833
We have been blacklisted by Zen1 TV
and no one is ready to offer us a job.

1147
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:35,417
So, you guys are up against Zen1 TV?

1148
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:38,542
One thing is clear.
He has decided to destroy you guys.

1149
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:41,833
But God has other plans.
He has decided to offer you refuge.

1150
01:30:46,292 --> 01:30:48,667
This is your room.
Take a good look at it.

1151
01:30:48,792 --> 01:30:50,917
Let me make one thing clear.

1152
01:30:51,042 --> 01:30:56,375
As quoted in the holy scriptures:
"Do your duty and expect not results".

1153
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:59,292
Why did he say that now?

1154
01:30:59,417 --> 01:31:02,083
He means you can kiss your salary goodbye.

1155
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,292
Shady pharmacy, downstairs.
Waste mart, upstairs.

1156
01:31:06,417 --> 01:31:08,292
Look, a customer is waiting for us.

1157
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:14,167
What are you waiting for?
We've got to give this room a makeover.

1158
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:27,417
'They say they wanna change it!'

1159
01:31:27,542 --> 01:31:31,000
'They say they wanna change something!'

1160
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:36,542
'There they go making tea
in an empty tea stall.'

1161
01:31:36,667 --> 01:31:38,458
'They say they wanna change it!'

1162
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:42,167
'They say they wanna change something!'

1163
01:31:42,292 --> 01:31:47,625
'There they go preparing tea
in an empty tea stall.'

1164
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:29,083
"Train service disrupted due to buffaloes"
-Is this what you call breaking news?

1165
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:31,708
I have a great idea for a new show...

1166
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:33,875
Get up!
Do you know who I am?

1167
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,167
Shantaram...

1168
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:38,958
Kids will be brimming with ideas.

1169
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:41,792
We need to learn to keep up,
else we'll be outdated.

1170
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,917
'Why all the ruckus
in this ruddy old office?'

1171
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:49,083
'Think you are 'Rajnikanth'
to soar to the sky in a single song?'

1172
01:32:49,208 --> 01:32:51,583
'Your mother bore you
to provide for the family!'

1173
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:54,458
'But you turned out to be
a stranded sailor in an island!'

1174
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:57,083
'A dramatic soap opera tops the chart.'

1175
01:32:57,208 --> 01:33:00,083
'Your silly documentary is simply a blot.'

1176
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:02,542
'You came to sell in a mucky market...'

1177
01:33:02,667 --> 01:33:05,500
'Pray tell!
Why the godforsaken principles?'

1178
01:33:16,917 --> 01:33:19,000
'They say they wanna change it!'

1179
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:22,333
'They say they wanna change something!'

1180
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:27,875
'There they go preparing tea
in an empty tea stall.'

1181
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,792
'They say they wanna change it!'

1182
01:33:29,917 --> 01:33:33,417
'They say they wanna change something!'

1183
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:38,333
'There they go preparing tea
in an empty tea stall.'

1184
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:46,500
Son, do you really need the light
for all this?

1185
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,792
'With your pals,
you crank up the craziness.'

1186
01:34:03,917 --> 01:34:06,750
'And bask in the roaring fire,
which you set upon the trash.'

1187
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:09,625
'You dream of converting
metal into sweetmeat.'

1188
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:12,375
'And you bungle up
the only meal for the day.'

1189
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,708
'On your antenna,
all there is, is crow crap.'

1190
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:17,917
'No matter what you do,
your TRP will never rise, my chap!'

1191
01:34:18,042 --> 01:34:20,667
'Take some rest
and have a cup of coffee.'

1192
01:34:20,792 --> 01:34:23,417
'And into the crappy cup of life
let's go pee-pee.'

1193
01:34:34,792 --> 01:34:36,250
You're too cute.

1194
01:34:37,292 --> 01:34:39,625
What kind of a show can we do
without any money?

1195
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,708
We can do a reality show on beggars.

1196
01:34:41,833 --> 01:34:43,958
And we even have a participant ready.

1197
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:46,375
Folks, check this out.

1198
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,458
Remember we saw an uncle
who was taking his dog for a walk?

1199
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:51,458
He is the police commissioner.

1200
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:54,167
While in disguise,
he arrested redwood smugglers.

1201
01:34:54,292 --> 01:34:56,417
That's the lorry that almost hit us.

1202
01:34:56,542 --> 01:34:59,542
So, the guy in shorts
was actually an undercover cop?

1203
01:35:00,542 --> 01:35:04,250
Look at this, sir! They brought back
the toilet seats, which we had disposed.

1204
01:35:04,375 --> 01:35:07,542
You may consider it trash,
but they look at it as treasure.

1205
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:10,833
They transformed toilet seats
into artistic artifacts. Let it be!

1206
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:12,792
Please sit down, sir.

1207
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:21,208
Back in the old days,
kings often went out in disguise.

1208
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:24,292
Similarly our current leaders
could disguise themselves...

1209
01:35:24,417 --> 01:35:29,750
...and keep tabs on the happenings
of their respective departments.

1210
01:35:29,875 --> 01:35:32,292
And this could be filmed by us candidly.

1211
01:35:32,417 --> 01:35:37,000
So you want the cops and corporation chaps
to disguise themselves?

1212
01:35:37,125 --> 01:35:40,333
Thilak, we are discussing something.
What are you fiddling with?

1213
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:43,417
Boss, this was the reality show
that screwed us at Zen1 TV.

1214
01:35:43,542 --> 01:35:46,625
We couldn't complete it.
He's been brooding over it all morning.

1215
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,750
Why does it make you so upset?
May I see it?

1216
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:51,125
I hope you don't mind.
-Of course not.

1217
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:54,750
"What about the adjacent lakes
drying up?"

1218
01:35:54,875 --> 01:35:58,000
"Did people die?
So many that it warrants a list?"

1219
01:35:59,417 --> 01:36:02,375
What the hell are they doing to you?

1220
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,417
We need to strike back.

1221
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:12,083
There is a bigger story behind his anger
than what you see here.

1222
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:14,083
If you permit,
we can take this further.

1223
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:17,167
This footage was taken covertly at Zen1 TV.

1224
01:36:17,292 --> 01:36:19,333
We will face legal issues if we air it.

1225
01:36:19,458 --> 01:36:21,167
That's alright.
We can face it.

1226
01:36:22,167 --> 01:36:24,000
I'm with you.
Go ahead and do it.

1227
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:27,833
Thilak, there he is.
Pull over.

1228
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:42,667
Sorry, Thilak.
I misunderstood you.

1229
01:36:42,792 --> 01:36:45,792
Malar told me about everything
that happened in the studio.

1230
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:53,542
A once mighty river runs dry now.
Look at its condition.

1231
01:36:53,667 --> 01:36:55,500
The river and the lake have dried up.

1232
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:57,667
This has affected agriculture.

1233
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:05,542
There are at least 60 kids
with skeletal deformities.

1234
01:37:07,542 --> 01:37:09,000
Let me finish washing these.

1235
01:37:09,125 --> 01:37:12,167
This is the result of the pollution
caused by Dheeran's factory.

1236
01:37:20,292 --> 01:37:23,333
Thilak, this is Murugan,
a member of our team.

1237
01:37:24,542 --> 01:37:27,125
This is brother Yaseem,
our village head.

1238
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:31,167
Had you seen this town
twenty years ago...

1239
01:37:31,292 --> 01:37:34,292
...you would have witnessed
the sprawling greenery.

1240
01:37:34,417 --> 01:37:41,458
Within three months of sowing seeds,
the land would be ripe with crops.

1241
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:44,708
No summer could dry up our lake.

1242
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:49,417
Our land was a healthy haven
to humans and other beings alike.

1243
01:37:49,542 --> 01:37:54,417
But now, the factory effluents,
let into the lake, cause various diseases.

1244
01:37:54,542 --> 01:37:57,417
Our young ones are paralyzed
by deformities.

1245
01:37:57,542 --> 01:38:01,792
Legendary actors
once danced on this very ground.

1246
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:03,125
Look at its state now.

1247
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:07,333
Contracts for fishing used to run
into the tune of several lakhs.

1248
01:38:07,458 --> 01:38:10,083
Now, one can't even spot a frog.

1249
01:38:10,208 --> 01:38:14,083
Once an ideal location for rustic films.
Now, it's apt only for morbid films.

1250
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:17,500
The factory releases a chemical
named 'Arsenic' into the lake...

1251
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:19,792
...which pollutes the ground water.

1252
01:38:19,917 --> 01:38:24,042
That is the sole reason for these
skeletal deformities and paralysis.

1253
01:38:24,167 --> 01:38:26,583
These people spin stories.
Don't believe them.

1254
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:31,583
Interfamilial marriages
are the primary cause for birth defects.

1255
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:33,958
Are you a doctor
or a suck up to the factory?

1256
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:37,542
Things are just settling down.
Why have you brought them here?

1257
01:38:37,667 --> 01:38:40,792
Thanks to this factory,
we are all employed.

1258
01:38:40,917 --> 01:38:45,667
Mr. Dheeran has donated a lot of money
to our temples and mosques.

1259
01:38:45,792 --> 01:38:49,417
Traitors!
Haven't they laid a bore well at 500 feet?

1260
01:38:49,542 --> 01:38:51,625
Enough!
What good is it to have a bore well?

1261
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:56,542
They're responsible for the depletion
of water in the first place.

1262
01:38:56,667 --> 01:39:02,083
Kaseem, you sold us out for money
and sabotaged our town.

1263
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:04,792
You will rot in hell!

1264
01:39:04,917 --> 01:39:09,167
Our people have realised that
Dheeran has used our own flesh to feed us.

1265
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:13,875
You're the root cause of all our problems.
Get lost!

1266
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,458
Check out what's happening.

1267
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:30,917
The minute you see a camera,
you flock around like geese!

1268
01:39:31,042 --> 01:39:34,292
Put the camera down.
-Sir, what are you doing?

1269
01:39:34,417 --> 01:39:40,000
Don't have anything better to do?
All you do is complain about methane.

1270
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:42,083
You complain about textile factories.

1271
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:44,083
You complain about nuclear plants.

1272
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:47,667
If you oppose every scheme,
how will our country progress?

1273
01:39:47,792 --> 01:39:50,125
This affects the livelihood
of ordinary people.

1274
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,792
Does electricity grow on trees?

1275
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:54,125
You keep saying
that chemicals are harmful...

1276
01:39:54,250 --> 01:39:57,333
...but if a toilet stinks,
you clean it with acid, not milk, right?

1277
01:39:57,458 --> 01:40:00,917
That's true.
But can we use acid to clean our butts?

1278
01:40:01,542 --> 01:40:03,667
So, you can say anything
if you're the press?

1279
01:40:03,792 --> 01:40:05,667
Didn't you see the board?

1280
01:40:05,792 --> 01:40:08,292
Aren't you an educated guy?
Leave now.

1281
01:40:08,417 --> 01:40:10,625
Wastrel!
-Sir, he's calling you!

1282
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:14,542
I meant that they have only bought
the waste land. But, what about the lake?

1283
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:16,083
Why have they cordoned it off?

1284
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:18,875
The lake belongs to the town.
Why is photography banned?

1285
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,583
What's going on behind closed doors?
Bomb making or rocket launching?

1286
01:40:22,708 --> 01:40:26,000
You belong to a nameless channel.
You think you know the law?

1287
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:28,250
Ask them to file a case.
Go ahead!

1288
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:30,250
What are you recording?
Shut it down.

1289
01:40:32,875 --> 01:40:36,292
Do you guys want to be bunched up in a cell
and bashed?

1290
01:40:43,292 --> 01:40:45,667
Please don't beat me.

1291
01:41:15,417 --> 01:41:20,083
'Dheeran' Maniarasu speaking.
-'Veeran' Mayilvahanan, here.

1292
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:27,792
What do you want?
-Don't air anything false about my factory.

1293
01:41:27,917 --> 01:41:35,625
Never! We'd never air anything false.
The truth would be telecast as it is.

1294
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:41,042
Think you're being funny, are you?
I'll make sure you regret it.

1295
01:41:41,167 --> 01:41:45,417
You cunning fox,
I'll see to it you end up in a trap!

1296
01:41:45,542 --> 01:41:47,708
Who the hell
do you think you are talking to?

1297
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:50,458
Hold on.
-Who does he think he's messing with?

1298
01:41:51,792 --> 01:41:58,625
If you telecast the content
that Thilak shot in my studio...

1299
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:02,708
...I'll file a defamation case.
It will be the end of you.

1300
01:42:02,833 --> 01:42:04,417
Hey boss, good evening!

1301
01:42:05,708 --> 01:42:08,125
Defamation case?
Go ahead and file it.

1302
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:13,667
I air it, you'll be stripped to the pants.
File a case, be ready to be stripped bare.

1303
01:42:13,792 --> 01:42:16,917
The truth will come out.
Your true colors will be revealed.

1304
01:42:17,292 --> 01:42:18,458
You cool with that?

1305
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:23,625
I'm a 'Rowdy' too.
-The game is on!

1306
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:25,292
Go and get Abdul!

1307
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:32,500
If the media and politics come together,
they can create or destroy anything.

1308
01:42:32,625 --> 01:42:36,125
By starting an illegal pesticide company,
politician Dheeran...

1309
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:39,875
...and the media which played accomplice
have ruined an entire town.

1310
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,750
A rogue like Dheeran
who committed such heinous crimes...

1311
01:42:42,875 --> 01:42:48,250
...is being shamelessly likened
to the great Kamaraj on Zen1 TV.

1312
01:42:48,375 --> 01:42:50,375
No other media has questioned them.

1313
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:55,000
Why don't you raise your voice
against them? Change the channel.

1314
01:42:55,125 --> 01:42:58,792
"Boss! Aren't you a media person too?
Why didn't you question them?"

1315
01:42:59,208 --> 01:43:01,500
"I can hear you guys shouting at me."

1316
01:43:01,792 --> 01:43:03,917
"I raised my voice and questioned them."

1317
01:43:04,375 --> 01:43:06,042
But the channel didn't air it.

1318
01:43:06,583 --> 01:43:10,458
As a media person, I raised questions.
As a business person, my boss buried them.

1319
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:14,042
For your viewing pleasure,
here's the exclusive footage...

1320
01:43:14,375 --> 01:43:20,583
...of Dheeran Maniarasu's transformation
to an action hero.

1321
01:43:22,708 --> 01:43:25,875
"Did people die?
So many that it warrants a list?"

1322
01:43:30,208 --> 01:43:34,667
What fate has befallen the victims
of Dheeran Maniarasu?

1323
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,667
What is their next move?

1324
01:43:36,792 --> 01:43:40,875
This is Kalpana, the once cheerful girl,
who has been reduced to a mere shell.

1325
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:44,708
When the protests begin,
she would stand behind, guiding us.

1326
01:43:44,833 --> 01:43:49,083
But the moment there is a lathi charge,
she would be the first to face the baton.

1327
01:43:49,208 --> 01:43:53,667
The factory which you just saw,
is downright poisonous.

1328
01:43:53,792 --> 01:43:59,375
Because, we questioned them,
they ruined her life.

1329
01:44:00,292 --> 01:44:05,250
Some doctors took bribes from Dheeran
and prescribed wrong medicines.

1330
01:44:05,375 --> 01:44:08,625
Without a hint of remorse,
they lied that they misdiagnosed her.

1331
01:44:10,875 --> 01:44:12,625
It's Dheeran's handiwork.

1332
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:14,042
What the hell?

1333
01:44:14,167 --> 01:44:20,000
With the HRC's support,
we sent water samples to UNESCO labs.

1334
01:44:20,125 --> 01:44:21,875
The results will be out soon.

1335
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,583
The reasons behind the protest
will come to light.

1336
01:44:25,417 --> 01:44:28,792
The dirt which surrounds us,
surrounds you too. Let's clean it.

1337
01:44:28,917 --> 01:44:32,750
Screaming your views on social media
isn't worth a single dime.

1338
01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:35,333
We have to be there in the flesh
and fight it out.

1339
01:44:35,458 --> 01:44:37,833
We have to meet our opponent
face to face.

1340
01:44:38,167 --> 01:44:39,833
They must feel the rage in our eyes.

1341
01:44:40,875 --> 01:44:45,083
If we remain quiet,
they will turn us into permanent slaves.

1342
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:47,583
That must not happen.

1343
01:44:47,708 --> 01:44:50,542
They've shown us what happens
when you question authority.

1344
01:44:50,667 --> 01:44:53,083
Let's show them the power of revolution.

1345
01:44:54,667 --> 01:44:57,750
Media has played a pivotal role
in creating change and awareness.

1346
01:44:58,167 --> 01:45:01,167
But itâs very agonizing
to think about the other side of media.

1347
01:45:01,792 --> 01:45:04,333
Films equal glamour,
politics equal corruption...

1348
01:45:04,458 --> 01:45:07,792
...religion equals violence,
and minorities equal terrorism.

1349
01:45:07,917 --> 01:45:09,917
An entire generation is tuned this way.

1350
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,417
We, the media, are responsible for this.

1351
01:45:17,042 --> 01:45:19,292
In spite of many threats,
look at their nerve!

1352
01:45:19,417 --> 01:45:23,625
This isn't something to sit and talk about.
It requires physical force!

1353
01:45:25,083 --> 01:45:27,583
There's a situation.
Have the truck ready.

1354
01:45:27,708 --> 01:45:29,542
Please be patient.
-What's the use?

1355
01:45:29,667 --> 01:45:32,708
He'll keep pissing in my mouth.
Should I just swallow it?

1356
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:37,375
The election is near. The whole city knows
about your issues with him.

1357
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:40,875
If you try killing him now,
they will surely suspect you.

1358
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,042
The media will wake up.
Just leave this to me.

1359
01:45:44,167 --> 01:45:49,792
Just watch how I tear them apart.
-I'll give you two days.

1360
01:45:49,917 --> 01:45:54,583
Beyond that, if you stop me,
the truck will run over you first.

1361
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,333
Our generation
and the two that preceded us...

1362
01:46:00,458 --> 01:46:05,292
What have we learnt from our predecessors?
How do we evaluate the choices they made?

1363
01:46:05,417 --> 01:46:08,875
If we interview all of them at once,
our target audience will get bigger.

1364
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,542
And we've got a certified hit show...
-Excuse me, sir!

1365
01:46:11,667 --> 01:46:13,333
Oh no! He's here too.
-May I come in?

1366
01:46:15,542 --> 01:46:18,625
Sit, my foot!
Get the hell up!

1367
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:20,417
Veerasamy, erase that board.

1368
01:46:22,458 --> 01:46:24,083
I've got a great idea for a new show.

1369
01:46:24,208 --> 01:46:27,375
Everyone's out celebrating
and you're torturing them like this?

1370
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,958
Don't you feel sorry for them?
Look at this guy.

1371
01:46:30,083 --> 01:46:34,417
He looks like a constipated chump
struggling to take a dump.

1372
01:46:34,542 --> 01:46:36,500
And you're just making it worse!

1373
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:41,750
Even someone who swims underwater
comes up once in a while for air.

1374
01:46:41,875 --> 01:46:45,333
That's what celebrations are for.
-And we will. Wonderfully.

1375
01:46:45,458 --> 01:46:47,500
But after five minutes, once this is done?

1376
01:46:47,625 --> 01:46:49,667
Time won't wait for you, pal.

1377
01:46:49,792 --> 01:46:53,250
When it's time to pick up a glass,
is it right to conduct a class?

1378
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:59,458
Oh mighty father, who swooped in
and saved us from this sinner!

1379
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:02,833
Show him no mercy!
-Give me that, Veerasamy.

1380
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:06,500
Here you go, sir.
-The New Year begins with a salary raise!

1381
01:47:06,625 --> 01:47:11,417
Spend this before it's declared invalid!
-Here you go, guys.

1382
01:47:14,875 --> 01:47:16,667
Your heart is as big as your girth.

1383
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:23,333
As of late, I've been overwhelmed
with a lot of appreciation...

1384
01:47:23,458 --> 01:47:26,833
...from people
who once saw this channel as a joke.

1385
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:29,292
All of this is very new to me.

1386
01:47:29,417 --> 01:47:32,250
Without you all, it wouldn't be possible.

1387
01:47:36,125 --> 01:47:37,333
Can I hug you, please?

1388
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:42,125
None of this would be possible
without you, sir.

1389
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:43,458
All praise to God.

1390
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:46,083
Just wait for five minutes.
We'll finish this.

1391
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:53,125
Dear boy, life just goes round and round.
Like bees, we may buzz around.

1392
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:57,125
That's why celebrations were found.
Don't be a dog in a pound.

1393
01:47:59,375 --> 01:48:01,958
Turn on the music.
Let's rock this joint!

1394
01:48:16,458 --> 01:48:18,125
'All our troubles are over.'

1395
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:21,000
'Work too hard
and your rear will catch fire.'

1396
01:48:22,792 --> 01:48:24,500
'I don't want any trouble.'

1397
01:48:24,625 --> 01:48:27,750
'No matter what anybody says,
live life your way.'

1398
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:33,958
'I am very, very, very happy.'

1399
01:48:38,542 --> 01:48:40,542
'I am very, very, very happy.'

1400
01:49:06,292 --> 01:49:09,333
'Let's forget our troubles
and spread our wings.'

1401
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:12,292
'And like a bird,
let's soar high in the sky.'

1402
01:49:16,958 --> 01:49:18,917
'I am very, very, very happy.'

1403
01:49:19,042 --> 01:49:22,125
'Let's burn the past and start anew.'

1404
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:25,125
'Let's flash a grin
at those who glare at us.'

1405
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:31,708
'I am very, very, very happy.'

1406
01:49:31,833 --> 01:49:34,875
'Life is a web of deception.
But we are not spiders.'

1407
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,083
'Can we try our hand
at life's game of dice?

1408
01:49:38,208 --> 01:49:41,542
'When a new year is born,
it calls for change.'

1409
01:49:41,667 --> 01:49:44,125
'Shall both generations
come together for this?'

1410
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:47,458
'The one who attacks,
the one who attracts...'

1411
01:49:47,583 --> 01:49:51,000
'...and the one who assaults, is you!
-Why me?'

1412
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:53,875
'You win with kindness
and stand with honour.'

1413
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,833
'You will always be our leader.
-That's enough about me!'

1414
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:03,500
'I am very, very, very happy.'

1415
01:50:08,208 --> 01:50:09,833
'I am very, very, very happy.'

1416
01:50:16,292 --> 01:50:19,333
'One shot.
Dude, is the party still happening?'

1417
01:50:19,458 --> 01:50:22,542
'Two shots. You don't know me.
Now, everything is mine.'

1418
01:50:22,667 --> 01:50:25,333
'Three shots. Boys dancing all around me.'

1419
01:50:25,458 --> 01:50:29,042
'I got four shots.
Everybody gotta get it in.'

1420
01:50:37,333 --> 01:50:38,792
'Bring it on, pal!'

1421
01:50:40,292 --> 01:50:42,083
'I'm cranking up the fun.'

1422
01:50:42,208 --> 01:50:45,292
'Giving advice is not my forte.'

1423
01:50:45,417 --> 01:50:48,417
'You aren't a half-baked tart.'

1424
01:50:48,542 --> 01:50:51,667
'Greed leads you to make mistakes
every day.'

1425
01:50:51,792 --> 01:50:54,375
'Learn to control it
and make victory come your way.'

1426
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:57,542
'Without knowing
what's right and what's wrong...'

1427
01:50:57,667 --> 01:51:00,750
'...with the beat,
your heart will go along.'

1428
01:51:00,875 --> 01:51:04,500
'Don't fall into the trap
of workplace tension.'

1429
01:51:04,625 --> 01:51:07,417
'Forget your miseries.
Go back to your nurseries.'

1430
01:51:07,542 --> 01:51:10,625
'The one who attacks,
the one who attracts...'

1431
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:13,750
'...and the one who assaults, is you!'

1432
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:17,000
'You win with kindness
and stand with honour.'

1433
01:51:17,125 --> 01:51:20,292
'You will always be our leader.'

1434
01:51:28,417 --> 01:51:31,125
'A few guys are getting antsy!'

1435
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:33,167
'Hit it strong!
Hit it fast!'

1436
01:51:33,292 --> 01:51:39,417
'I'm on my way, to set this world on fire.'

1437
01:51:53,917 --> 01:52:00,375
'Let's do it, buddy!'

1438
01:52:21,125 --> 01:52:23,208
Nobody over there knows your worth.

1439
01:52:30,375 --> 01:52:32,917
Bavana, I've been wanting to call you
myself.

1440
01:52:33,042 --> 01:52:37,292
We have an opening for you too.
For a maid, who cooks and cleans.

1441
01:52:37,417 --> 01:52:40,458
Are you up for it?
-Rot your life away over there.

1442
01:52:42,167 --> 01:52:45,667
Who was that?
-Bavana. She's offering 12 lakhs per year.

1443
01:52:45,792 --> 01:52:49,417
I got a call from her, too.
-What did you say?

1444
01:52:49,542 --> 01:52:52,167
I told her to get lost. You?

1445
01:52:52,292 --> 01:52:53,833
I asked her to come on over.

1446
01:52:56,333 --> 01:53:00,083
I meant there's an opening here for her.
And it's hers for the taking.

1447
01:53:00,208 --> 01:53:04,708
But seriously, she's quite a hottie.
-You creep. Wait for me.

1448
01:53:12,708 --> 01:53:14,458
Didn't you guys go as well?
-Where?

1449
01:53:14,583 --> 01:53:17,292
Your friends ran back to Zen1 TV.
-Be quiet.

1450
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:22,583
It's not their fault. It's natural
for birds to seek ponds with fish.

1451
01:53:22,708 --> 01:53:25,458
Had they told me,
I would have happily bid them farewell.

1452
01:53:28,625 --> 01:53:31,417
Ask Jagan to come out here.
-He was the first one to bail out.

1453
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:35,167
Nishanti and Arthy are gone, too.

1454
01:53:36,333 --> 01:53:40,167
Why didn't you go?
-I didn't get a phone call from them.

1455
01:53:41,708 --> 01:53:46,792
Come here. I can't pay you
that kind of a salary.

1456
01:53:46,917 --> 01:53:48,875
If you want to leave as well, go ahead.

1457
01:53:49,875 --> 01:53:52,708
I wasn't raised that way, sir.

1458
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:06,833
Jagan, you traitor! Why are you selfish?
-You know my role here? Executive Producer.

1459
01:54:06,958 --> 01:54:10,667
My salary? Rs. 61,300 per month.
Can I get it over there?

1460
01:54:10,792 --> 01:54:14,042
Aren't you ashamed to say that?
You had all kinds of fun...

1461
01:54:14,167 --> 01:54:17,917
...last night, at Mr. Mayil's expense.
Do you know how much he trusted you?

1462
01:54:18,042 --> 01:54:22,708
I can smell the stench of your loyalty
to him even here. It's unbearable.

1463
01:54:22,833 --> 01:54:26,583
That's why I'm saying, you be loyal there.
I'll be loyal here. Alright?

1464
01:54:26,708 --> 01:54:28,583
I've got a lot of work to do, so hang up.

1465
01:54:28,708 --> 01:54:31,208
That prick!
-Calm down.

1466
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:45,583
There's been an explosion
at the collector's office in Tiruvallur.

1467
01:54:48,083 --> 01:54:52,292
"Welcome. At 4:30 PM this evening,
there was a highly lethal bomb blast..."

1468
01:54:52,417 --> 01:54:56,333
"...in front of the collector's office
in Tiruvallur, which claimed five lives."

1469
01:54:56,458 --> 01:55:01,042
"Fifteen have been injured.
During the incident..."

1470
01:55:01,167 --> 01:55:04,792
How awful!
This is why I never go out.

1471
01:55:04,917 --> 01:55:09,083
"We've acquired exclusive footage
of this unfortunate incident."

1472
01:55:09,208 --> 01:55:15,833
"Who is this mysterious man?
Was there a bomb in his suitcase?"

1473
01:55:15,958 --> 01:55:18,917
"Shocking answers have been found
to these questions."

1474
01:55:19,042 --> 01:55:22,417
"After placing the suitcase
in a secluded part of the office..."

1475
01:55:22,542 --> 01:55:26,083
...the man seen leaving has been identified
as a terrorist leader..."

1476
01:55:26,208 --> 01:55:29,708
"...as per our research bureau's findings."
-Doesn't he look like Abdul?

1477
01:55:29,833 --> 01:55:35,667
When he gave that rousing speech that day,
I could see the terrorist urge in his eyes.

1478
01:55:38,583 --> 01:55:39,583
Yes, Thilak?

1479
01:55:39,708 --> 01:55:42,542
There's been a blast
at the Tiruvallur collector's office.

1480
01:55:42,667 --> 01:55:44,208
The media says you are behind it.

1481
01:55:44,333 --> 01:55:47,958
What are you talking about?
It's true I was there 30 minutes ago.

1482
01:55:48,083 --> 01:55:51,958
Don't explain anything. I trust you.
Do this. Go to the nearest police station.

1483
01:55:52,083 --> 01:55:56,875
Explain what happened. I'll be there soon.
-Why should I go there? I won't.

1484
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,042
Please do what I say.
You have to prove your innocence.

1485
01:56:00,167 --> 01:56:04,667
If you don't, false news will spread.
-He looks just like him.

1486
01:56:04,792 --> 01:56:06,625
Please trust me and do what I say.

1487
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:11,875
Go where I tell you to. They'll handle it.
-I'm not that kind of guy. Beat it!

1488
01:56:12,875 --> 01:56:16,417
Hey Kalyan,
there's a blockbuster director in you.

1489
01:56:16,542 --> 01:56:18,458
You even make the news look so grand!

1490
01:56:20,208 --> 01:56:24,708
Patiently watch the full match
until the final over.

1491
01:56:24,833 --> 01:56:28,708
Dude, each ball is a sixer from you.
This match is awesome.

1492
01:56:31,542 --> 01:56:34,583
The same group who bombed
the collector's office...

1493
01:56:34,708 --> 01:56:37,208
...also attacked a
Tiruvallur police station.

1494
01:56:40,458 --> 01:56:42,917
Make sure nothing false is reported.

1495
01:56:46,458 --> 01:56:48,333
Is this from a reliable source?

1496
01:56:53,292 --> 01:56:56,333
Is the news of Abdul's attack ready?
-Five minutes, sir.

1497
01:56:56,458 --> 01:56:58,500
Why the hell is it so slow?
Speed it up.

1498
01:56:58,625 --> 01:57:00,542
This okay?
-They must enter with a bang.

1499
01:57:00,667 --> 01:57:03,333
As soon as he enters,
I want the sound effect of gunfire.

1500
01:57:04,750 --> 01:57:08,542
Is the footage ready? Make it fast.
-Almost done.

1501
01:57:08,667 --> 01:57:12,375
"Abdul is an IAS terrorist. In our town..."
-Change the background...

1502
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:13,500
"Give me a sec..."

1503
01:57:13,625 --> 01:57:18,542
Fool! Just because he messed up his lines,
why the hell are you waiting?

1504
01:57:18,667 --> 01:57:20,000
Look for an alternate take!

1505
01:57:20,125 --> 01:57:23,375
"Sir. Abdul is...
-Put the paper away and talk."

1506
01:57:28,083 --> 01:57:32,208
"Abdul is an agent
of the ISIS terrorist group!"

1507
01:57:32,333 --> 01:57:36,250
Do I have to teach you basic editing?

1508
01:57:36,375 --> 01:57:39,625
Don't ever tell anyone
that you were Editor Anthony's assistant.

1509
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:41,542
Almost done, sir.
Let's go.

1510
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,708
"Breaking News!"

1511
01:57:48,833 --> 01:57:52,250
"The terrorist Abdul and his group
are in hiding..."

1512
01:57:52,375 --> 01:57:56,083
"...at the forest near Tiruvallur."

1513
01:57:56,208 --> 01:57:59,500
"These incidents have struck fear..."
-Get over there now, Ashok.

1514
01:58:00,583 --> 01:58:05,583
"A stunning new development.
Abdul and his gang..."

1515
01:58:05,708 --> 01:58:08,708
"...stormed into a police station."
-They've sped up the shot.

1516
01:58:08,833 --> 01:58:11,167
"The cops, who were attacked,
returned fire."

1517
01:58:11,292 --> 01:58:13,083
"Abdul was shot, but he got away."

1518
01:58:13,208 --> 01:58:16,583
Sir, how can one hear anything
on a surveillance camera?

1519
01:58:16,708 --> 01:58:20,250
"When we questioned the inspector..."

1520
01:58:20,375 --> 01:58:24,250
"We have on record, that Abdul's gang
are guilty of many anti-national crimes."

1521
01:58:24,375 --> 01:58:28,708
"The entire police force is on the hunt
to apprehend these terrorists."

1522
01:58:28,833 --> 01:58:32,375
"We are ready to handle any situation
that may arise."

1523
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:36,625
"Abdul is an agent of the ISIS group!"

1524
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:39,417
"He asked us to join him too.
He said it was a holy war..."

1525
01:58:39,542 --> 01:58:41,917
"...and how heaven awaits us
and all kind of crap."

1526
01:58:42,042 --> 01:58:44,208
"Had we turned him in
to the cops, that day..."

1527
01:58:44,333 --> 01:58:47,792
"...he wouldn't be humiliating us
like this. The whole town is ashamed!"

1528
01:58:47,917 --> 01:58:51,792
"Abdul's childhood friends have confirmed
that he has been linked..."

1529
01:58:51,917 --> 01:58:55,333
"...to many international terrorist cells
for many years."

1530
01:59:04,292 --> 01:59:07,833
They've branded only the three of us
as terrorists and are hunting us down.

1531
01:59:08,833 --> 01:59:12,958
Why are you risking your life needlessly
and coming along with us? Go away!

1532
01:59:13,083 --> 01:59:16,250
Why do you want me to leave now?
Didn't we start all of this together?

1533
01:59:16,375 --> 01:59:20,542
Did we bond because of religion?
If you're unsafe, I don't want to be here.

1534
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:23,792
We're comrades till the end. Let's go!
-Please listen to me.

1535
01:59:32,625 --> 01:59:35,583
What's going on?
-They're searching every vehicle for Abdul.

1536
01:59:35,708 --> 01:59:37,458
How do we get past them?
-Stop the car!

1537
01:59:37,583 --> 01:59:39,542
No entry for vehicles.
-We're press!

1538
01:59:39,667 --> 01:59:43,208
Stop the car!
-I'm coming, sir.

1539
01:59:43,333 --> 01:59:45,917
Didn't you hear me?
Turn around!

1540
01:59:46,042 --> 01:59:51,000
Please listen to me, sir.
-We can't permit anyone to go further.

1541
01:59:53,625 --> 01:59:58,917
The group under Abdul's leadership
is said to be linked to the gangs in Iraq.

1542
01:59:59,042 --> 02:00:02,083
We've been informed
that Abdul and his gang are in hiding...

1543
02:00:02,208 --> 02:00:06,542
...within a five-kilometre radius
around this Tiruvallur forest.

1544
02:00:10,042 --> 02:00:13,875
The search parties are on the prowl...
-Hey, Rashid. Where's Abdul?

1545
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,917
Come with me and I'll tell you.
-Stop rolling the camera.

1546
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:21,125
Hold this microphone.
Give me that camera.

1547
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:26,583
"Abdul's group is said to have been funded
by several prominent rogue nations."

1548
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:32,708
Turn left at the mud road, Thilak.

1549
02:00:58,375 --> 02:01:00,042
Come along. He's right here.

1550
02:01:06,792 --> 02:01:09,958
Abdul, it's us.
-Oh my god, what happened?

1551
02:01:11,042 --> 02:01:15,208
What the hell happened, Abdul?
Let's get you to a hospital.

1552
02:01:15,333 --> 02:01:18,083
Like you asked,
I went to a police station to tell them...

1553
02:01:18,208 --> 02:01:21,833
...I had nothing to do with the blast.
They didn't even let me explain.

1554
02:01:21,958 --> 02:01:24,292
They just started firing.
I can't be saved...

1555
02:01:24,417 --> 02:01:28,250
...but I will not die a terrorist.
-Let's get you to a hospital first.

1556
02:01:28,375 --> 02:01:31,125
I need to set the record straight.
You brought a camera?

1557
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:34,625
I want to speak my mind first.
-We'll record it en route to the hospital.

1558
02:01:36,583 --> 02:01:40,792
Yes, Ashok.
- Abdul is hiding behind Elephant rock.

1559
02:01:40,917 --> 02:01:44,333
On my way. Get our guys and come with me.
-Malar, go start the car.

1560
02:01:44,458 --> 02:01:48,583
Get him on his feet. Quickly!
-Careful. Let's get him to the car.

1561
02:02:18,292 --> 02:02:20,417
Are you set?
-Yes.

1562
02:02:20,542 --> 02:02:22,917
It's true
that I was at the Collector's office.

1563
02:02:23,042 --> 02:02:29,583
But it wasn't to kill anyone, but to
present proof of how Dheeran's factory...

1564
02:02:29,708 --> 02:02:32,625
...is killing hundreds.
-Are you Abdul? You can go in.

1565
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:35,500
That suitcase had the test results
and water samples.

1566
02:02:35,625 --> 02:02:38,792
There was a gang there,
who didn't let me meet the collector.

1567
02:02:38,917 --> 02:02:41,958
Is this the evidence?
-They threatened me and seized the case.

1568
02:02:42,083 --> 02:02:46,208
They asked me that if the air and water
was polluted, why couldn't I just leave?

1569
02:02:46,333 --> 02:02:49,292
Why should I leave?
Why do they see us as strangers?

1570
02:02:49,417 --> 02:02:50,792
This is my country!

1571
02:02:50,917 --> 02:02:55,042
Post-partition, India was the only
possible home for every other religion.

1572
02:02:55,167 --> 02:02:59,542
But for us Muslims, we had the choice
to go with either India or Pakistan.

1573
02:02:59,667 --> 02:03:03,833
Out of love for this country
and her people, with the belief...

1574
02:03:03,958 --> 02:03:07,250
...that we'd be safe here,
we willingly chose to stay in India.

1575
02:03:07,375 --> 02:03:09,000
We are the blood of this nation too!

1576
02:03:10,667 --> 02:03:14,167
During the Chennai floods,
they gave us refuge in several temples.

1577
02:03:14,292 --> 02:03:16,833
We got out there and saved millions.

1578
02:03:16,958 --> 02:03:19,750
Back then,
the media didn't care about my religion.

1579
02:03:19,875 --> 02:03:23,625
But when I'm fighting a politician,
they profile me like this.

1580
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:28,750
Instead of reporting the news ethically,
many are forced to sensationalize it.

1581
02:03:28,875 --> 02:03:32,792
The day the word 'news'
became 'news story', imaginations ran wild.

1582
02:03:32,917 --> 02:03:36,958
The media's hunger for sensation
has ruined the lives of many like me.

1583
02:03:37,083 --> 02:03:40,917
With this incident, they branded me
a terrorist, by tying it with my religion.

1584
02:03:41,042 --> 02:03:43,875
This is actual terrorism.
The media's terrorism.

1585
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,417
Only when the youth fight injustice,
do corporates show their true colours.

1586
02:03:48,542 --> 02:03:53,208
Then they brand the youth
as Dalits, Naxalites, and minorities.

1587
02:03:53,333 --> 02:03:56,625
But the public are well aware
of what's real and what isn't.

1588
02:04:08,917 --> 02:04:10,792
The cops are onto us.
Drive faster!

1589
02:04:13,542 --> 02:04:15,542
Keep your heads down.
-Careful, Malar.

1590
02:04:16,542 --> 02:04:19,292
Stay down, Abdul!
-Keep driving!

1591
02:04:20,542 --> 02:04:22,333
Don't be scared. Just keep going.

1592
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,375
Keep your heads down.
-Careful, Muruga!

1593
02:04:35,958 --> 02:04:38,125
They are firing again!
-Take cover!

1594
02:05:12,208 --> 02:05:14,292
Stay with me.
It's going to be alright.

1595
02:05:22,375 --> 02:05:25,167
Come on, Abdul!
-Get up there.

1596
02:05:32,042 --> 02:05:34,500
Abdul, are you hit?
-I've got to fight...

1597
02:05:34,625 --> 02:05:39,208
Go! They are specifically targeting you.
Keep moving!

1598
02:05:52,333 --> 02:05:58,042
Venkatesh, check inside the car!
Get him out of there.

1599
02:06:00,333 --> 02:06:02,375
Get them on their feet!

1600
02:06:03,667 --> 02:06:10,958
You killed Muruga! Scoundrels!
-Get him out of here!

1601
02:06:13,333 --> 02:06:19,708
Take them up to the jeep. Hurry!
-How could you do this to him?

1602
02:06:36,125 --> 02:06:39,250
I am getting a signal from Abdul's mic.
-He must be nearby.

1603
02:06:52,792 --> 02:06:55,917
This is enough to screw over
that old clown's network.

1604
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:05,042
"The perpetrators behind the two attacks
on government buildings at Tiruvallur..."

1605
02:07:05,167 --> 02:07:08,375
"...have been proven
to be linked to Muthamizh TV."

1606
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:13,542
"Our special correspondent, Ashok,
has captured exclusive footage..."

1607
02:07:13,667 --> 02:07:19,292
"...of Muthamizh TV's Thilak and Malar
rescuing Abdul from the police."

1608
02:07:19,417 --> 02:07:23,125
"This is Thilak of Muthamizh TV,
who helped the terrorist Abdul escape."

1609
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:28,833
"Will the government shut down
Muthamizh TV, for obstruction of justice?"

1610
02:07:28,958 --> 02:07:32,833
"Will its owner, Mr. Mayilvahanan,
be arrested?"

1611
02:07:39,375 --> 02:07:40,917
Over there! Abdul!

1612
02:07:44,083 --> 02:07:47,083
Finish this successfully
and your promotion is assured.

1613
02:07:48,083 --> 02:07:50,458
You'll be the next news editor
of Zen1 TV.

1614
02:08:01,542 --> 02:08:03,000
What's going on, Ashok?

1615
02:08:13,417 --> 02:08:15,833
Abdul, listen.
I had nothing to do with any of this.

1616
02:08:15,958 --> 02:08:17,750
Don't hurt me, Abdul.

1617
02:08:22,542 --> 02:08:27,167
"Breaking News! Our special correspondent,
Ashok, has been kidnapped..."

1618
02:08:27,292 --> 02:08:32,667
"...by the terrorist Abdul.
It appears he was violently attacked."

1619
02:08:32,792 --> 02:08:37,625
"Murugan, an innocent, was killed by
Abdul's gang, when he tried stopping them."

1620
02:08:37,750 --> 02:08:41,875
"What will happen next, in this situation
that seems to escalate every second?"

1621
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,708
"What are Abdul's demands?"

1622
02:08:43,833 --> 02:08:48,542
"Can our colleague Ashok escape them
or will he be executed by them?"

1623
02:08:48,667 --> 02:08:51,000
"More on this, after a short break."

1624
02:08:52,708 --> 02:08:56,333
"A shocking new development:
A triumph for the Tamil Nadu Police."

1625
02:08:56,458 --> 02:08:59,000
"Based on information given
by our research team..."

1626
02:08:59,125 --> 02:09:01,542
"...the police cornered
the terrorist Abdul."

1627
02:09:01,667 --> 02:09:07,250
"In the ensuing firefight,
Abdul and his gang were killed."

1628
02:09:07,375 --> 02:09:14,208
"For its valued input to the police
in these proceedings..."

1629
02:09:14,333 --> 02:09:17,917
"...there has been a tremendous outpour
of appreciation for Zen1 TV."

1630
02:09:21,042 --> 02:09:23,125
What happened? Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1631
02:09:23,250 --> 02:09:26,667
I couldn't reach you on the phone.
Didn't hear a peep from you for hours.

1632
02:09:27,667 --> 02:09:29,125
Have a seat, sir.

1633
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,458
Hello sir.
-Yes, Raghav.

1634
02:10:03,583 --> 02:10:06,667
Everything you did to orchestrate
Abdul's death...

1635
02:10:06,792 --> 02:10:08,958
...was captured by Thilak, on camera.

1636
02:10:09,083 --> 02:10:10,917
All the footage is in the editing room.

1637
02:10:18,958 --> 02:10:22,083
Not a single frame of Thilak's footage
should be broadcast.

1638
02:10:22,208 --> 02:10:24,167
How do you know about that?
-I know, Mayil.

1639
02:10:26,250 --> 02:10:28,958
Let's talk openly.
I'll buy the footage, as it is.

1640
02:10:29,083 --> 02:10:32,750
No wait...
I'll buy your entire channel.

1641
02:10:32,875 --> 02:10:37,375
Name your price. Come on!
How much do you want?

1642
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:42,625
How much can you offer?
-50 crores. Not a thing goes on air.

1643
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:45,833
You think you can hush this up
with just 50 crores?

1644
02:10:45,958 --> 02:10:52,042
If this footage goes on air,
your entire 1000 crore empire will crumble!

1645
02:10:52,167 --> 02:10:55,500
100 crores. Single payment.
-100 crores?

1646
02:10:55,625 --> 02:11:00,250
Includes channel properties, equipment
and all your old movie rights.

1647
02:11:00,375 --> 02:11:04,125
I can be at your office in fifteen minutes
with my lawyer.

1648
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:07,667
Not a millisecond of that footage
goes on air.

1649
02:11:07,792 --> 02:11:11,667
I need your assurance for that. Agreed?
-Agreed.

1650
02:11:13,542 --> 02:11:17,792
A 100 crores!
You can each take ten crores from that.

1651
02:11:18,917 --> 02:11:26,875
30 crores will settle my debts.
I can pay off my taxes and be stable again.

1652
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,583
Veerasamy, get everyone out of there
and lock the editing room.

1653
02:11:30,708 --> 02:11:34,083
Don't do this, sir.
All our troubles would've been for nothing.

1654
02:11:35,125 --> 02:11:38,167
Why are you changing tracks now?
Hold on for a minute, sir.

1655
02:11:38,292 --> 02:11:41,583
You're actually selling out to that fox?
-He is a fox.

1656
02:11:41,708 --> 02:11:45,750
A fox is just a fox. A dog is just a dog.
A leopard is just a leopard.

1657
02:11:45,875 --> 02:11:47,917
Combine all of them and you get a lion.

1658
02:11:48,042 --> 02:11:51,167
Shouldn't we show that slimeball
what this lion is capable of?

1659
02:11:52,875 --> 02:11:56,375
Is that all it was?
You scared me for a second!

1660
02:11:56,500 --> 02:12:02,292
Do you know he has a spy here?
-You knew about that, too?

1661
02:12:02,417 --> 02:12:07,083
Your eyes are in the front. So are mine.
But my eyes can see everything behind me.

1662
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:10,625
How do you do it?
Were you always this sharp?

1663
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:14,583
Let's stay focused.
We'll place hidden cameras in this room.

1664
02:12:14,708 --> 02:12:18,000
It'll record whatever he blurts out
and we'll broadcast it.

1665
02:12:19,292 --> 02:12:22,125
It won't work. It's an old idea.
He'll see through it.

1666
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:25,750
Do you have any new ideas?
-I don't have any of those.

1667
02:12:25,875 --> 02:12:28,083
But I have an idea
that's much, much older.

1668
02:12:29,625 --> 02:12:36,042
Muthamizh TV Down! Down!

1669
02:12:37,542 --> 02:12:40,292
Shall we barge in right now?
-Wait for our leader's signal.

1670
02:12:42,417 --> 02:12:47,667
Sir, all those videos were doctored.
It was all staged. None of it is true.

1671
02:12:47,792 --> 02:12:50,500
Ministry of Communication
is blacking out our channel.

1672
02:12:50,625 --> 02:12:52,250
Kalyan from Zen1 TV is here.

1673
02:12:54,542 --> 02:12:58,958
"Muthamizh TV has been blacked out
indefinitely, on charges of treason..."

1674
02:12:59,083 --> 02:13:01,417
"...and will soon face legal action..."

1675
02:13:01,542 --> 02:13:07,250
"...as ordered by the Central Government."

1676
02:13:07,375 --> 02:13:09,042
Muthamizh TV is off the air.

1677
02:13:09,167 --> 02:13:14,208
"For his complicity with terrorists,
Mayilvahanan will be arrested any minute."

1678
02:13:14,333 --> 02:13:15,708
Where's the editing room?

1679
02:13:15,833 --> 02:13:20,333
"Muthamizh's co-conspirators,
Thilak and Malar, are still at large."

1680
02:13:20,458 --> 02:13:24,292
"A TV network conspiring with terrorists
is a first in Indian history."

1681
02:13:24,417 --> 02:13:28,375
Don't let anyone near that room.
-"Suspicion has also been raised..."

1682
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:31,750
"...that Mayilvahanan is being funded
from overseas."

1683
02:13:31,875 --> 02:13:35,083
I'm Veerasamy,
Mr. Mayilvahanan's right-hand man.

1684
02:13:36,708 --> 02:13:38,333
They are here, sir.

1685
02:13:41,375 --> 02:13:44,417
Please come in.
Have a seat.

1686
02:13:44,542 --> 02:13:47,167
I'm Ramachandran,
Zen1 TV's Lawyer and Legal Advisor.

1687
02:13:47,292 --> 02:13:48,417
Please sit down.

1688
02:13:54,208 --> 02:13:58,625
In fact, I don't even trust myself.
So, let's all put our phones away.

1689
02:14:02,917 --> 02:14:06,375
We need to check if they've made
any copies of the footage in question.

1690
02:14:08,042 --> 02:14:11,333
The footage hasn't left the editing room.
It's all there.

1691
02:14:12,333 --> 02:14:16,208
My black sheep in this building
is supervising all of it.

1692
02:14:27,125 --> 02:14:31,208
Get the contract. The terms we discussed
over the phone. No changes in them.

1693
02:14:31,333 --> 02:14:32,792
I've already signed it.

1694
02:14:33,792 --> 02:14:35,250
Praise be to God.

1695
02:14:42,083 --> 02:14:44,917
Sketch pens everywhere.
Veerasamy, get me a fountain pen.

1696
02:14:45,042 --> 02:14:46,458
In a minute, sir.

1697
02:14:52,417 --> 02:14:53,875
Here you go, sir.

1698
02:15:00,875 --> 02:15:03,667
All's well that ends well.
Thank you.

1699
02:15:06,833 --> 02:15:08,292
[Come forth, lousy critter...]

1700
02:15:13,542 --> 02:15:16,333
Come forth, lousy critter,
you soggy banana fritter!

1701
02:15:16,458 --> 02:15:19,125
I'll roast you, you sinner,
and serve you for dinner!

1702
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,792
Can you feel the sting?
-Are you crazy?

1703
02:15:23,917 --> 02:15:27,208
Can't read the fine print?
I'll rip your tongue out.

1704
02:15:28,917 --> 02:15:33,250
I work this hard so that my company
doesn't falter for even a minute.

1705
02:15:33,375 --> 02:15:35,583
You completely blacked me out,
didn't you?

1706
02:15:35,708 --> 02:15:39,625
I'll make you black out your channel
with your own hands.

1707
02:15:43,750 --> 02:15:47,417
Wipe that smirk off your face.
Want to know what the real punch line is?

1708
02:15:47,542 --> 02:15:50,500
You sent one black sheep
to graze in my channel.

1709
02:15:50,625 --> 02:15:52,958
I've sent an entire herd
to graze in yours.

1710
02:15:53,958 --> 02:15:56,792
Jagan, change your SIM card.
Malar, get a backup phone.

1711
02:15:56,917 --> 02:15:59,125
When I need your help,
I'll call you Nishanti.

1712
02:16:01,458 --> 02:16:04,292
Yes, Mayil.
-We're on, Pillai.

1713
02:16:39,792 --> 02:16:45,208
"This agency is for those who are keen
to take up jobs in Gulf countries."

1714
02:16:45,333 --> 02:16:50,417
"They will be functional
in major metro cities every April..."

1715
02:16:50,542 --> 02:16:54,875
"...as announced by the Central Youth
and Sports Minister, yesterday."

1716
02:17:00,167 --> 02:17:06,125
"The Agricultural Minister inaugurated
the National Botanical Gardens, in Ooty."

1717
02:17:08,167 --> 02:17:12,417
"Near Melur, a government bus collided..."
-Johnson, Bavana called for you.

1718
02:17:12,542 --> 02:17:14,542
Why?
-To knit couch cushions for her sofa!

1719
02:17:14,667 --> 02:17:16,917
Some technical difficulties, dude. Go!

1720
02:17:17,042 --> 02:17:20,750
I'm monitoring a live feed here.
-I'll handle it. It's nothing new to me.

1721
02:17:20,875 --> 02:17:22,542
Don't mess with the controls.

1722
02:17:27,250 --> 02:17:30,958
"To protest the Kerala government
setting up a dam at river Bhavani..."

1723
02:17:31,083 --> 02:17:35,500
"...the labourers of Erode
have gone on a daylong hunger strike."

1724
02:17:36,667 --> 02:17:40,000
"A Jallikattu event was successfully
held near Tirupathur..."

1725
02:17:40,125 --> 02:17:45,875
"...in the district of Sivagangai,
yesterday. 350 bulls were involved..."

1726
02:17:52,958 --> 02:17:56,458
"Breaking News. Exclusive footage
which proves the innocence..."

1727
02:17:56,583 --> 02:18:00,708
"...of the suspected terrorist, Abdul,
that we just received from Muthamizh TV."

1728
02:18:00,833 --> 02:18:03,125
"It's true
that I was at the Collector's office."

1729
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:10,375
"But it wasn't to kill anyone, but to
present proof of how Dheeran's factory..."

1730
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:13,000
"...is killing hundreds."

1731
02:18:13,125 --> 02:18:17,500
Why did the feed change, sir?
-There's been a new development.

1732
02:18:17,625 --> 02:18:20,667
"Dheeran's Global Dragon factory
has been killing hundreds."

1733
02:18:20,792 --> 02:18:27,417
This is not in our channel's favour.
Who gave you these clips?

1734
02:18:27,542 --> 02:18:30,917
This wasn't in the schedule.
-Shut your trap and mind your business.

1735
02:18:31,042 --> 02:18:33,125
This isn't right. I'll get fired for this.

1736
02:18:34,333 --> 02:18:37,917
Move, Kaga! Stop the telecast.
-"They didn't let me meet the collector..."

1737
02:18:39,125 --> 02:18:42,708
They've stopped broadcasting, just like us!
-How the hell did this happen?

1738
02:18:42,833 --> 02:18:46,083
Give me the phone!
This can't be happening.

1739
02:18:46,208 --> 02:18:51,125
How long has it been since we've seen
the 'Sorry for the Interruption' sign?

1740
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:53,292
I last saw it on good old Doordarshan.

1741
02:18:53,417 --> 02:18:58,417
He is disrupting our plan at the PCR room
just as we suspected, Jagan.

1742
02:18:58,542 --> 02:19:00,333
No problem. I'll take it from here.

1743
02:19:01,333 --> 02:19:05,167
"They brand the youth
as Dalits, Naxalites and minorities."

1744
02:19:06,917 --> 02:19:09,958
"They will kill me.
I know I'm going to die."

1745
02:19:10,083 --> 02:19:13,625
"But I will not let this be for nothing."
-Why are you standing? Have a seat.

1746
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:17,875
"I wanted you to know..."
-Can one missing comb stop a wedding?

1747
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,542
You think your dam can stop a tsunami?
-What's happening? Where is Jagan?

1748
02:19:21,667 --> 02:19:25,667
You can cut us off here, at the PCR.
But can you stop the big daddy, the MCR?

1749
02:19:35,833 --> 02:19:37,833
Open this door!
What are you doing?

1750
02:19:37,958 --> 02:19:42,208
"I wanted you to know my true motives
at least in my last moments."

1751
02:19:42,333 --> 02:19:46,250
"By presenting this footage,
the world will understand Zen1's deceit..."

1752
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:53,208
Take a look, Kalyan!

1753
02:19:53,333 --> 02:19:58,500
Watch how your Zen1 TV has transformed
completely into Muthamizh TV!

1754
02:19:59,625 --> 02:20:01,083
Hey Thilak!
-Yes boss?

1755
02:20:01,208 --> 02:20:06,292
I'm a hero to the virtuous.
But, a villain to the vicious.

1756
02:20:23,500 --> 02:20:25,833
Don't you know
how to place a file properly?

1757
02:20:31,583 --> 02:20:33,792
You wanted to see me?
-No, I didn't.

1758
02:20:33,917 --> 02:20:37,917
Jagan said you needed my help.
-Check the Reuters feed in the MCR...

1759
02:20:38,042 --> 02:20:42,208
"Here's a confrontation between Abdul,
the activist, and a reporter of Zen1 TV..."

1760
02:20:42,333 --> 02:20:44,875
"Abdul, listen.
I had nothing to do with any of this."

1761
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,458
Don't hurt me, Abdul.

1762
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,083
I'm still here, sir.
Please give me a minute.

1763
02:20:55,083 --> 02:20:57,167
Abdul is right here, sir.
-What's going on?

1764
02:20:57,292 --> 02:21:00,917
I was just driving down the road.
He showed up in front of me and collapsed.

1765
02:21:01,042 --> 02:21:03,708
Is he still alive?
-Just a minute. Let me check.

1766
02:21:09,083 --> 02:21:12,667
Shall I call the police?
-No. First, load him up in your car.

1767
02:21:12,792 --> 02:21:17,792
I'll tell you what to do, after that.
Just follow my instructions. Load him up.

1768
02:21:17,917 --> 02:21:20,542
Stop saying "Okay". Make it fast!
-Right away, sir.

1769
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:35,833
"This conversation between Zen1's chairman,
Kalyan, and its reporter Ashok..."

1770
02:21:35,958 --> 02:21:39,292
"...was recorded on a microphone
attached to Abdul's shirt."

1771
02:21:41,125 --> 02:21:42,792
Let's hurry!

1772
02:21:49,625 --> 02:21:52,917
"I've got Abdul in the back of my car.
Should I turn him in, to the cops?"

1773
02:21:53,042 --> 02:21:56,958
"Not yet. We need to build on this.
I have another plan."

1774
02:21:57,083 --> 02:21:59,083
We'll need to rewrite this whole thing.

1775
02:21:59,208 --> 02:22:02,167
Right now, our channel has 90%
of the total viewership.

1776
02:22:02,292 --> 02:22:06,833
We're going to break the record
for ratings, through Abdul.

1777
02:22:06,958 --> 02:22:10,167
After five minutes, call Inspector Bala.
-Alright.

1778
02:22:10,292 --> 02:22:15,542
In that time, I'll consult with Dheeran
and devise a plan to share with you.

1779
02:22:27,042 --> 02:22:33,208
"This conspiratorial phone call between..."
-He looks tense. Get him some water.

1780
02:22:33,333 --> 02:22:38,083
Let's go back to the office, and stop this.
-It'll be too late. They'll pay for this.

1781
02:22:38,208 --> 02:22:45,542
"More to come on the other perpetrators
behind Abdul's brutal murder."

1782
02:22:45,667 --> 02:22:47,500
Yes sir?
-What's going there, Pillai?

1783
02:22:47,625 --> 02:22:52,167
Weren't you the one who wanted
a breaking news update every ten minutes?

1784
02:22:52,292 --> 02:22:57,417
We're just following your wishes.
Full of twists and turns. Do you like it?

1785
02:22:57,542 --> 02:23:01,667
I will kill you!
-Like how you killed Abdul?

1786
02:23:01,792 --> 02:23:03,917
What the hell is this crap?

1787
02:23:04,042 --> 02:23:07,125
The flash news is coming up.
It'll be even spicier. Don't miss it.

1788
02:23:07,250 --> 02:23:09,458
"How are Dheeran and Kalyan
connected here?"

1789
02:23:16,333 --> 02:23:19,917
Ma'am, the door isn't opening.
-What? Where is my card?

1790
02:23:31,083 --> 02:23:33,667
Sir, the PCR is offline.
MCR has the control.

1791
02:23:33,792 --> 02:23:36,667
Then, stop the MCR.
-Jagan has blocked it.

1792
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:40,750
Our spies are doing a good job, I hope?

1793
02:23:44,667 --> 02:23:47,250
"Will Zen1 TV be shut down?"
-What's happening?

1794
02:23:47,375 --> 02:23:51,792
"Will the owner Kalyan be arrested?"
-Kalyan, I'm locked in my office.

1795
02:23:51,917 --> 02:23:56,250
Somebody has taken over.
-Bavana, stop it at any cost.

1796
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:15,083
The signal is strong.

1797
02:24:19,958 --> 02:24:22,250
Hey Malar, look over there.
The cops are here.

1798
02:24:31,542 --> 02:24:33,000
Lay him down here.

1799
02:24:34,208 --> 02:24:36,500
"You wanted to shoot it.
Where's the cameraman?"

1800
02:24:36,625 --> 02:24:38,708
"He'll be here soon.
-We don't have time."

1801
02:24:38,833 --> 02:24:40,292
"He will be here any minute."

1802
02:24:41,417 --> 02:24:44,500
There he is.
Mohan, get the camera and come soon.

1803
02:24:44,625 --> 02:24:45,708
Bring them over.

1804
02:24:47,375 --> 02:24:48,833
Get him here.

1805
02:24:51,083 --> 02:24:54,458
Pillai, what's happening?

1806
02:24:56,083 --> 02:24:58,250
Have you gone mad?

1807
02:24:59,708 --> 02:25:02,667
You can't stomp down truth.

1808
02:25:05,250 --> 02:25:09,792
This slap is for calling yourself
'a youth'.

1809
02:25:10,167 --> 02:25:11,750
I won't spare you.
-Get lost!

1810
02:25:20,125 --> 02:25:23,583
Come on, sir!
Here's a gift from our boss.

1811
02:25:29,292 --> 02:25:30,875
He isn't worth wiping my shoes on.

1812
02:25:31,458 --> 02:25:34,292
"He tried to ruin me.
What are you waiting for? Kill him."

1813
02:25:34,417 --> 02:25:38,750
"He wanted to shoot it.
-A short film on murder? Skip it."

1814
02:25:38,875 --> 02:25:42,042
"We need footage to air.
You shouldn't be here. Please leave."

1815
02:25:42,167 --> 02:25:45,375
"He'll be dead
before you reach the end of the road."

1816
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:48,167
"I can't trust you with this.
I'll leave my men behind."

1817
02:25:49,333 --> 02:25:51,958
"Stay here and get the job done.
-We will, sir."

1818
02:25:52,458 --> 02:25:54,417
Lift him and have him lean over
on the tree.

1819
02:26:02,583 --> 02:26:04,125
Make it look like he's sitting.

1820
02:26:04,250 --> 02:26:07,083
We've got to get this done
before he regains consciousness.

1821
02:26:11,833 --> 02:26:14,125
His head is tilted.
Keep it straight.

1822
02:26:15,417 --> 02:26:18,083
Yeah, that's it.
-His head isn't stable.

1823
02:26:18,208 --> 02:26:19,667
Just a second, Bala.

1824
02:26:23,042 --> 02:26:24,500
Use this to prop his head up.

1825
02:26:25,417 --> 02:26:26,875
Get the dummy gun.

1826
02:26:28,375 --> 02:26:29,875
Mohan, the double tape, please.

1827
02:26:35,625 --> 02:26:37,083
Let's roll.

1828
02:26:37,917 --> 02:26:39,375
His eyes are closed.

1829
02:26:39,958 --> 02:26:41,500
Mohan, give me your sunglasses.

1830
02:26:45,583 --> 02:26:47,917
Remove the cars.
Clear the field.

1831
02:26:48,125 --> 02:26:51,625
Tie my hands.
Careful, Bala.

1832
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,500
You don't look like you've been kidnapped.
Your face is fresh.

1833
02:26:57,625 --> 02:26:59,083
What can we do about it, Bala?

1834
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,417
Hold him.
I will knock you out.

1835
02:27:02,542 --> 02:27:04,875
Tighter.
And you, go stand next to Abdul.

1836
02:27:07,208 --> 02:27:10,250
Ashok, what am I supposed to do?
-Get going. Come with them.

1837
02:27:12,667 --> 02:27:14,125
Mohan, make it realistic.

1838
02:27:16,125 --> 02:27:18,833
Just a moment.
Security is on the line.

1839
02:27:33,083 --> 02:27:35,000
I'm there now.
I'm near the MCR room.

1840
02:27:36,208 --> 02:27:37,917
We are unable to open the room.

1841
02:27:38,333 --> 02:27:39,583
Go to the adjacent room.

1842
02:27:39,792 --> 02:27:41,500
He wants us get to the CAR room.

1843
02:27:53,375 --> 02:27:54,833
Abdul, let go of me.

1844
02:27:55,125 --> 02:27:57,083
Abdul, please don't shoot me.

1845
02:28:06,458 --> 02:28:09,667
Where is the technician in charge of this?
-She wants the password.

1846
02:28:09,792 --> 02:28:12,083
Ask the man in charge.
-They're looking for him.

1847
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:30,208
Just do what I say.
Do you see the wires beneath the server?

1848
02:28:31,833 --> 02:28:33,042
Cut those wires.

1849
02:28:51,708 --> 02:28:54,500
Didn't I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1850
02:28:55,208 --> 02:28:57,125
And that's how I knock you out.

1851
02:28:57,250 --> 02:28:59,667
And you have ensured
your channel's blackout.

1852
02:29:00,792 --> 02:29:01,792
What is it, boss?

1853
02:29:03,083 --> 02:29:04,875
Don't you want to see the full story?

1854
02:30:52,542 --> 02:30:53,542
I'll kill you!

1855
02:31:25,208 --> 02:31:29,250
Thilak, don't mess with media.
-Oh no! I messed with the media, eh?

1856
02:31:29,625 --> 02:31:31,583
Don't play around with me.
You're doomed!

1857
02:31:33,083 --> 02:31:35,125
You think I shoot pornos for a living?

1858
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:36,875
I belong to the same media too.

1859
02:31:38,042 --> 02:31:39,708
You are going out of bounds!

1860
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,750
Let's come to an understanding.
-Between two men?

1861
02:31:47,875 --> 02:31:50,542
We will come to a deal.

1862
02:31:50,667 --> 02:31:52,250
It's a deal between you and me.

1863
02:31:52,875 --> 02:31:54,167
Me?
-Yeah.

1864
02:31:54,292 --> 02:31:56,958
With you?
-Yeah, just between us.

1865
02:31:57,083 --> 02:31:59,375
It will never work out for me,
you scumbag!

1866
02:32:10,875 --> 02:32:13,792
Look what they have done, buddy!
-Give me your phone.

1867
02:32:16,208 --> 02:32:18,708
Talk to the commissioner
and call for an ambulance.

1868
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:23,250
Come here.
Abdul, we have one last detail left.

1869
02:32:23,542 --> 02:32:27,792
Act like you are dead.
Just trust me on this.

1870
02:32:27,917 --> 02:32:29,708
I have a reason.

1871
02:32:33,333 --> 02:32:34,875
Go ahead and shoot that now.

1872
02:32:38,750 --> 02:32:41,458
Is it done?

1873
02:32:43,250 --> 02:32:46,917
I'll edit the footage of both our cameras.
Hand it over to your channel.

1874
02:32:47,042 --> 02:32:49,250
As far as your boss is concerned,
Abdul is dead.

1875
02:32:50,167 --> 02:32:55,958
And thus, Kalyan,
we can boost ratings by telling the truth.

1876
02:32:56,083 --> 02:32:57,875
Learn it from me.
No harm.

1877
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:02,667
Don't shoot him!

1878
02:33:02,917 --> 02:33:04,917
Go ahead!
Shoot me.

1879
02:33:06,750 --> 02:33:09,917
Do you think I'm a fool
to kill you guys here?

1880
02:33:11,250 --> 02:33:16,208
I will do it at the right time.
What can you guys do to me?

1881
02:33:16,333 --> 02:33:19,750
I was the one, who made people believe
that Abdul was a terrorist.

1882
02:33:19,875 --> 02:33:24,625
I made the cops shoot him
and made it a sensation on the news!

1883
02:33:24,833 --> 02:33:27,542
Top lawyers will come running
to my defense.

1884
02:33:27,875 --> 02:33:33,625
If I do get caught,
Ashok and Bala would be the scapegoats.

1885
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:35,333
Okay, guys.
Our leader is here.

1886
02:33:38,958 --> 02:33:40,750
Shall we take this place apart?

1887
02:33:40,875 --> 02:33:43,125
Get inside.
-Destroy everything!

1888
02:33:54,792 --> 02:33:57,833
When I commit crimes,
I always ensure that I leave no trail.

1889
02:33:57,958 --> 02:34:01,667
You guys don't have any evidence
against me.

1890
02:34:02,458 --> 02:34:04,333
Why are you wasting your breath on them?

1891
02:34:04,708 --> 02:34:07,875
I planted only a firecracker
in the collector's office.

1892
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,500
I've got an atom bomb here.

1893
02:34:09,625 --> 02:34:12,458
It is ten times stronger.
You can't do a damn thing about it.

1894
02:34:12,583 --> 02:34:17,000
We can't pull off anything against you.
But we can pull this off for sure!

1895
02:34:19,042 --> 02:34:20,833
This is called a fake beard.

1896
02:34:21,250 --> 02:34:24,250
Do you recognize our police commissioner?

1897
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:33,667
Our nation is down in the dumps
because of black sheep like you.

1898
02:34:36,292 --> 02:34:40,667
These guys are just pawns.
Kalyan will just dump them and move on.

1899
02:34:41,125 --> 02:34:44,083
We need strong evidence against him.

1900
02:34:44,375 --> 02:34:46,542
To get that kind of evidence,
we ought to...

1901
02:34:46,667 --> 02:34:49,625
We ought to do what?
-You'll need to put on another disguise.

1902
02:34:50,042 --> 02:34:52,250
Your dog walker act was superb.

1903
02:34:53,333 --> 02:34:57,083
What boss?
Fell for the oldest trick in the book?

1904
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Let go of me!

1905
02:35:04,375 --> 02:35:06,500
Your confessions have been recorded here.

1906
02:35:09,708 --> 02:35:14,292
In not so many words,
the commissioner says you're screwed.

1907
02:35:25,292 --> 02:35:29,250
"You were rescued from a staged encounter.
What do you have to say?"

1908
02:35:29,375 --> 02:35:33,458
"Humanity is a lot bigger
than politics, religion and authority."

1909
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:36,417
"Anything in the world can change."

1910
02:35:37,208 --> 02:35:41,333
"But someone will always be there
to help the needy."

1911
02:35:41,750 --> 02:35:45,125
"That will never change.
And it was Thilak, who saved me."

1912
02:35:45,958 --> 02:35:47,542
"Thank you very much, Thilak."

1913
02:35:48,292 --> 02:35:50,958
"If you want to fight us,
fight against our opinions."

1914
02:35:51,542 --> 02:35:54,417
"But don't be a coward
and play with our virtue or life."

1915
02:35:55,875 --> 02:35:57,583
Seeds of revolution will take root.

1916
02:35:58,167 --> 02:36:00,333
Rise or fall, we will pave the way!

1917
02:36:03,625 --> 02:36:05,667
"Why did you try to kill Abdul..."

1918
02:36:05,792 --> 02:36:10,292
Stop it right there. Haven't you made
enough of a joke out of me?

1919
02:36:10,417 --> 02:36:12,833
You've disgraced the media.
What do you have to say?

1920
02:36:14,375 --> 02:36:17,417
I just gave the audience
what they wanted to see.

1921
02:36:17,542 --> 02:36:18,625
What's wrong in that?

1922
02:36:43,083 --> 02:36:45,542
On this joyous occasion,
a song comes to my mind.

1923
02:36:47,250 --> 02:36:50,917
Wonderful, sir!
I have the same song on my mind.

1924
02:36:51,042 --> 02:36:52,792
Which song?

1925
02:36:52,917 --> 02:36:55,667
I haven't even opened my mouth yet.
How would you know?

1926
02:36:55,792 --> 02:36:57,042
I know your heart, sir.

1927
02:36:57,208 --> 02:36:59,708
Not the 'beep song'.
A song by our legend.

1928
02:36:59,833 --> 02:37:00,833
Go on. Sing!

1929
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,167
Shall I sing?
I'll really do it.

1930
02:37:03,375 --> 02:37:06,833
'Victory shall be mine.'

1931
02:37:06,958 --> 02:37:11,250
'And the credit for that shall be yours.'

1932
02:37:11,375 --> 02:37:15,417
'Victory shall be mine.'

1933
02:37:15,833 --> 02:37:20,708
'And the credit for that shall be yours.'

1934
02:37:21,500 --> 02:37:25,000
Leave all that aside.
Were you always like this?

1935
02:37:25,333 --> 02:37:29,917
No, sir.
Only after we all got together.
