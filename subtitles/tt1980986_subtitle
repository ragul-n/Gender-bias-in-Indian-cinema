1
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,842
It's your cue to bring the
animals forward when I say.

2
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,812
You two. I want you over there.

3
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,941
We've got one hour to go.

4
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:20,844
Henna Kapoor.

5
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,784
Designated member of
the LAW organization.

6
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,719
Loving Animals Worldwide.

7
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:28,384
These people torture the animals..

8
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,860
..To make them perform.

9
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,760
Boys, seize all the animals.

10
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,324
You can't do this.
- I'll show you.

11
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,525
I'll show you.

12
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,434
And who are you?

13
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,534
Bobby Kapoor.

14
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,669
Designated member of
the LAW organization.

15
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,178
Loving Animals Worldwide.

16
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,180
And how many are there world wide?

17
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,347
And this is the head
of our department.

18
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,577
Look, sir.

19
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,918
How this entire raid was
conducted because of me.

20
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,249
I had carried out this
sting operation, sir.

21
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,758
What else can a scorpion do?

22
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:02,824
Sting Operation.

23
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,327
Look, look, one second.

24
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,397
The credit of this
raid goes to both of you.

25
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,397
And this is nothing.

26
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,592
The pet that you have in your house.

27
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,532
A python.

28
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,332
What else do you expect, sir?

29
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,838
Her entire family is
a bunch of serpents.

30
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,637
Don't talk too much,

31
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,507
Of all the animals, you've
kept a crocodile in your house.

32
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,238
Correct.

33
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,282
Because your family is just too much.

34
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,645
Shut up, Bobby.
- You shut up, Henna.

35
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,343
Just mind your business.
- You mind your language.

36
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,284
You cow.
- You fox.

37
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,253
Shut up, Bobby.
- You shut up.

38
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,422
Sir, why are they quarreling?

39
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,423
Who are they?

40
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,955
They are cousin sisters.

41
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,659
If this is the case with the sisters..

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,286
..Then wonder how
their mothers will be?

43
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,691
I am Mrs. Kapoor.

44
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,426
I've a 4 o'clock appointment.

45
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,362
Excuse me.

46
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,469
I am Mrs. Kapoor.

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,631
And I've a 4 o'clock appointment.

48
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,232
Actually... both of
you are Mrs. Kapoor..

49
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,640
..So we made a mistake.

50
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,644
Look, that's your problem.

51
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,408
Now, if you'll excuse me.

52
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,504
My turn.

53
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,675
"My turn."

54
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,378
You've injected a ton of botox,
but what's the use?

55
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,880
You don't look like Ms.
England either.

56
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,014
You old hag.

57
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,916
Ma'am, please don't quarrel.

58
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,494
Otherwise your facelift will shift.

59
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,289
Shut up. - That will happen to her,
mine's been done fantastically.

60
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,525
Who are these two?

61
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,990
Sisters-in-law.

62
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,558
Oh, God.

63
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,966
If this is the case with them..

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,603
..Then wonder how
their husband's might be?

65
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,905
Good morning, gentlemen.

66
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,508
You'll be happy to know..

67
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,638
..That the demand for
our United Baby Products..

68
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,014
..Is increasing
worldwide and not just in UK.

69
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:34,944
Sixer!

70
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,385
Daboo, shut up.

71
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,829
How could you start
the meeting without me?

72
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:54,534
And with the company's co-chairman.

73
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,672
Gentlemen, since he joined us..

74
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,879
..The profit figures of our company..

75
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,675
..Have fallen, just like him.

76
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,444
Chintu, don't you dare.

77
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,485
I will, Daboo. I will.

78
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,554
Because you're just Kapoor and son..

79
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,920
..And I am Kapoor and real son.

80
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,890
Real.

81
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,584
Legitimate.

82
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,389
You're crossing your limit, Chintu.

83
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,426
My father was the one
who crossed his limit.

84
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,769
He gave me a brother, that
too from another mother.

85
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,736
But I was born first.

86
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,705
There was nothing official about it.

87
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,935
I had a direct delivery.

88
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,704
But I was born first.

89
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,877
Don't think so highly of yourself.

90
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,541
You're a Chintu since
the time you were born.

91
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,743
But I am more respected.

92
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,576
Though you were illegitimate..

93
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,847
..My father equally divided
the house, business, wealth.

94
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,354
..Between us.

95
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,856
That's why we've been
sharing everything all our life.

96
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,449
Remember one thing.

97
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,429
Illegitimates are born out of love.

98
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:53,923
Real sons, out of duty.

99
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,025
You and your family took
advantage of that love..

100
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,502
..And snatched my right.

101
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,730
Otherwise, you, your
wife and your daughter..

102
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,536
..Are no better than beggars.

103
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,941
Don't you dare take
my daughter's name.

104
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,640
Now I will show you what
my daughter's stature is..

105
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,080
..When I get her married
in UK's wealthiest family.

106
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,115
UK?

107
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,581
Uttarakhand!

108
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,949
Just watch where I get
my daughter married.

109
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,994
Your daughter's husband will
be a penniless pickpocket.

110
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,121
And your son-in-law
will be characterless.

111
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,922
You wait and watch, Daboo.

112
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,626
You watch your wait, Chintu.

113
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,997
I will get the best son-in-law.

114
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,126
I will get the best son-in-law.

115
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,166
I will get the best son-in-law.

116
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,871
I will get the best son-in-law.

117
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,925
Kapoor and son.

118
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,588
Kapoor and real son.

119
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,166
Both brother's will quarrel,
and Pasta will mint money.

120
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,164
After all I run London's
most famous marriage bureau.

121
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,563
Aakhri Pasta.

122
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,662
Kapoor, I am coming. I am coming.

123
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,142
Where are you these days, Pasta?

124
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,677
Since you opened up
the marriage bureau..

125
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,906
..You are really busy.

126
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,048
What to do, Mr. Kapoor?

127
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,449
These days the father of every young
girl has only one name

128
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,714
Aakhri Pasta.

129
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,790
To get engaged, Aakhri Pasta.

130
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,825
To get married, Aakhri Pasta.

131
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,486
Even on their wedding night,
Aakhri Pasta.

132
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,496
I am joking.

133
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,862
You'll have breakfast alone,
and Aakhri Pasta will starve.

134
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,957
Shut up.

135
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:38,968
Listen to me.

136
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,095
You can charge me double the fees..

137
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,139
..But I want London's
wealthiest and the best groom..

138
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,936
..For my daughter Heena.

139
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,476
Carlito

140
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,103
Hello.

141
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,111
Hello, Pasta.

142
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,142
Idiot. Come to my house right away.

143
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,608
Okay. I will come tomorrow.

144
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,686
Today, right now.

145
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,152
On the spot.

146
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,613
Excuse me, Mr. Kapoor.

147
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,057
Where's your bathroom?

148
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,218
It's a little urgent.

149
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,086
Urgent ?

150
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,164
Last night in the
restaurant I had the last pasta.

151
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,666
Now it's looking for a way out.

152
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,822
Daboo

153
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,828
What are you doing in
my bedroom, in my bed?

154
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,925
I want to douse my eternal craving.

155
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,900
Stop it!

156
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,629
I am joking.

157
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,296
That's better.

158
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,936
Look, Pasta.

159
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,037
You can charge me double.

160
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:57,012
But I want a top-notch,
fantastic boy for my daughter.

161
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,571
Okay, sir.

162
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,743
My words are like the
arrow shot from a bow.

163
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:06,885
And if you go to that rascal Chintu..

164
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,859
..Then I will shove
that arrow up yours *""".

165
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,190
Understood

166
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,829
Hello.

167
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,925
Pasta.

168
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,800
Are you immersed in your Potty

169
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,997
What's taking you so long?

170
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:24,902
Mr. Kapoor.

171
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,110
Do you have a loo in your house?
- What?

172
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,702
Bathroom.

173
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,745
Bloody fool, you were in the bathroom.

174
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,017
What are you doing in the kitchen?

175
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,990
There was no toilet
paper in the bathroom..

176
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,823
..So I came to get some water.

177
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,227
I wrote the names of
rich and famous boys..

178
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,697
..On the toilet paper
for your daughter Henna.

179
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,898
Bloody fool.

180
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,268
If this toilet paper
that has the names of..

181
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:59,072
..The rich and famous boys
falls in the hands of Daboo.

182
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,236
..Then I will hit you very badly

183
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,677
I will hit you very badly

184
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,304
How is that possible?

185
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,106
I am your man.

186
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,045
Your mouth stinks.

187
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,949
Mr. and Mrs. Rajendra Babani.

188
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,356
You will really like
Chintu Kapoor's family.

189
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,184
Pasta, please speak softly.

190
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,229
He has a heart condition.

191
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,961
Why does he get a shock
if someone speaks loudly?

192
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,902
Back in our company, a steel
weighing thousands of ton..

193
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,939
..Fell before him.

194
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,132
And it shattered his eardrums.

195
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,142
Gayatri

196
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,679
We're going to select a bride for Jai.

197
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,108
But today he isn't with us.

198
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,376
I wish he was with us..

199
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,913
Call him.

200
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,356
Jai sir.

201
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,925
Again.

202
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,331
Parul, I've told you
so many times that..

203
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,406
..You're not just my
assistant but also a good friend.

204
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,733
Please call me Jai.
- Okay, Jai.

205
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,037
That's better.

206
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,712
Actually..
- Yes.

207
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,046
There's something I want to say.

208
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,719
I know what you want to say.

209
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,245
But before that there's
something I want to say.

210
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,852
One second.

211
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,120
My dad

212
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:29,360
Jai. I know that you
always did as I said.

213
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,994
Actually, son, I called you to say..

214
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,202
..That we're going to
select a bride for you.

215
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,076
It's a really nice family, son.

216
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,268
I hope you won't say no.

217
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,341
Don't worry, dad.

218
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,273
I'll do as you say.

219
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,156
You were going to say something.

220
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,955
My dad has fixed my
marriage somewhere else.

221
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,494
And you don't want to hurt him.

222
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,037
Parul, you were going to
say something as well.

223
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,806
Yes. I...wanted to say something.

224
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,107
It was a pleasure assisting you, Jai.

225
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,918
Goodbye.

226
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,857
Welcome, Mr. and Mrs.
Rajendra Babani...

227
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,091
Please carry on with the snacks.

228
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,459
If you don't mind,
can you speak softly?

229
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,496
Loud noises give him a heart trouble.

230
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,326
Oh, I am so sorry.

231
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,029
I did not know, sorry.

232
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,773
I was saying, why
didn't your son come along.

233
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,034
We've to discuss about his life today.

234
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,372
How can he, Mr. Chintu.

235
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,945
He's serving time in
Delhi's Tihar Jail..

236
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,139
..For murdering a girl.

237
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,410
Are you serious?
- I am joking.

238
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,180
Right now he's doing a
calendar shoot in Hawaii.

239
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,516
That boy's a real gem.

240
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,812
He's so tall.

241
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,391
He's so handsome.

242
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,223
He doesn't look like his son.

243
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,264
You're joking?
- I am serious.

244
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,834
Don't be fooled by his looks.

245
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:11,833
He looks half-beaten.

246
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,164
He's completely opposite.

247
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,136
He's fairer.

248
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,831
He's very beautiful.

249
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:21,571
He doesn't look like his real,
but his step-son.

250
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,211
Step-son?

251
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,446
Step-son?

252
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,880
Excuse me, is he talking
about your son? - Yes.

253
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,823
Why, what's wrong?

254
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,154
"What's wrong?"

255
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,222
Keep the snacks down.

256
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,431
You're over-reacting.

257
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,091
Keep that laddoo down.

258
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,859
I am sure, completely sure.

259
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,096
That Jai is an illegitimate child.

260
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,001
He's their step-son.

261
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,504
Kapoor sir, what..

262
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,871
What are you..
- Keep that jalebi down.

263
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,104
Jai, is his father's son.

264
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,111
I never said he wasn't.

265
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,045
But you aren't his father.

266
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,118
Your wife took the 'Love
thy neighbor' too seriously.

267
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:01,947
Please, Mr. Kapoor.

268
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,884
Shut up, woman.

269
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,479
What's the point in
making steel locks..

270
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,288
..When your fair neighbor
had the key to your house.

271
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,156
Have some shame.

272
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,094
You shut up.

273
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,357
Your fate black.

274
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,227
You're black.

275
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,028
Life has done a black comedy with you.

276
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:17,600
Black comedy.

277
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,268
How dare you?
- You witch, keep quiet.

278
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,431
Impotent neutron, get
your son's DNA test done.

279
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,408
First lets get his ECG done. Come on.

280
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,535
Who would know better..

281
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,977
..About legitimate and
illegitimate better than me?

282
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,605
Out, out, out. Get out from here.

283
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,312
And remember, Pasta.

284
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,146
Don't get me proposals of
such illegitimate families.

285
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,915
Get me legitimate millionaires.

286
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,557
Hindujas. Mittal. JD's.

287
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,648
Get me their proposals.

288
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,552
Or don't show me your face.

289
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,458
Out!

290
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,059
What did you say?

291
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,363
Kapoor right?

292
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,597
And you didn't even stop him.

293
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,635
What could I do?

294
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,409
He kept insulting uncle non-stop.

295
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,503
He insulted him so badly
that he suffered a heart-attack.

296
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:06,606
He said "Get me proposals from
Hinduja, Mittal, or JD's son

297
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,450
What did you say?

298
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,013
JD's son.

299
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,180
He want's JD's son, doesn't he?

300
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,994
I will give him JD's son.

301
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,196
Because JD's son Jolly
is my childhood friend.

302
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:28,336
Now JD's son will avenge
my father's humiliation.

303
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,438
Come on, Jolly. Not again.

304
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,475
Look, I didn't stop in
my tracks this time.

305
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,511
Yes, but you are hesitating.

306
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,204
Why are you so scared of your dad?

307
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,542
I am not scared of my dad.

308
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,605
Last time I didn't even
get down from the chopper.

309
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,278
And this time I took ten steps
ahead from the chopper with you.

310
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,254
Let's face it, Jolly.
You don't have the guts.

311
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,153
You've brought me here 6th times.

312
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,190
Sixth time.

313
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,282
But you never
introduced me to you dad.

314
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,453
Seventh time, ma'am.

315
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,052
Shut up, Mike.

316
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,324
From now I am going to lead
my life the way I want to.

317
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,624
I am a model.

318
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,133
I will do bikini shoots.

319
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,064
Hot videos.

320
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,538
And you'll have the right to stop me..

321
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,505
..Only when you
introduce me to your dad.

322
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,201
And talk about our relation.

323
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,177
And tell him that
you want to marry me.

324
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,507
Bye.

325
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,584
Brother.

326
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,351
What a scene.

327
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,324
You are very strange.

328
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,224
You're a wealthy man now.

329
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,693
JD sir.

330
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,529
Yet the same simplicity.

331
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,792
The same dhoti, same kurta.

332
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,527
And cleaning Badal every morning,
brushing him.

333
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,095
What is this?

334
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,403
How do you manage it?

335
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,570
Patil, don't you know.

336
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,240
No matter however wealthy JD becomes.

337
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,815
He might touch the sky..

338
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,450
..But his feet will
stay rooted on the ground.

339
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:59,387
Father, today I will
speak and you will listen.

340
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:02,424
Father, today I will
speak and you will listen.

341
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,786
Yes.

342
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,421
Father.

343
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,493
What?

344
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,099
Today you'll speak and I will listen.

345
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,764
That's fine.

346
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,137
But where are you these days?

347
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,801
Spend some time...
with your father as well.

348
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,738
I...I have a friend.

349
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,114
Friendship is fine.

350
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,678
But don't get into a relationship.

351
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,553
You don't know.

352
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,523
But I've fixed your marriage..

353
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,824
..With my friend Batook Patel's
daughter when you were a child.

354
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,429
And I have given my word.

355
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,497
Word.

356
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,434
Let's go.
- Jolly.

357
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,172
Maharashtrian boy and Gujarati girl.

358
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,714
A combination of 'Lejim' and 'Dandia'.

359
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,808
"The clouds have parted, and
raindrops are falling pitter-patter."

360
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,292
Hello.

361
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,450
What?

362
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,263
You saw that Jolly.

363
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,767
Just like that Kapoor gave
my father a heart-attack..

364
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,668
..Similarly you'll give
that Kapoor a heart-attack.

365
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,400
Me?
- Yes, you Jolly.

366
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,872
That Kapoor want's JD's son.

367
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,409
You are JD's son.

368
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,241
Look, go up to him and fix
your marriage with his daughter

369
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,440
And refuse on the day of the marriage.

370
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,481
He will surely suffer a heart-attack.

371
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,918
If my father JD finds out
about this fake marriage..

372
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,177
No.

373
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,247
Jai, I haven't told my father
about my real girlfriend yet.

374
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,348
Jolly, this is my father.

375
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,824
And that is my father.

376
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,555
You don't know my father.

377
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,689
When he loses his mind,
I am really scared.

378
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,771
I can't do it, but someone else can.

379
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,730
What do you mean?
- I mean..

380
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:02,336
Kapoor want's JD's son, right.
- Yes.

381
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,344
You know I am JD's son.

382
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,213
I know I am JD's son.

383
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,476
But Kapoor doesn't
know who JD's son is.

384
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,446
What do you mean?

385
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,819
I mean we'll send someone
else to Kapoor's house..

386
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,449
..Posing as JD's son.

387
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,390
Bingo.
- He'll do our job.

388
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,987
You mean fake Jolly.

389
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,423
Exactly.

390
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,522
That's a good plan..

391
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,365
..But we need a big rascal for this.

392
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,531
Rascal.

393
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,935
Jai. Remember back in college.
- Who?

394
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:33,772
Him.

395
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,674
"Don't know about this, but that."

396
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,405
Him.
- Just a minute.

397
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,344
Are you talking about him?
- Yes.

398
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,940
I am talking about him.

399
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,853
He's a big rascal.
- How big?

400
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,687
Not just that, but he's
a common thief as well.

401
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,358
And only he can do this job.

402
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,827
Perfecto.

403
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,398
But what is his name?

404
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,295
Max!

405
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:49,747
Can't say about Italian,
but I will do the job.

406
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,912
Yes.

407
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,010
Thanks, Max.

408
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,024
So, how much will it cost us?

409
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,054
Cost you? What are you saying?

410
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,592
My charge will be 50,000 Pounds.

411
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,722
Cash.

412
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,925
Fine, Max.

413
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,335
We'll give you 50,000 Pounds.

414
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,535
But I will stay with you.

415
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,634
I want to see that Kapoor suffer.

416
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,637
His action for the marriage.

417
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,338
And his reaction for
the shattered marriage.

418
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,413
Then, Jai.

419
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,378
You and Max..

420
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,747
I mean you go with JD's
son Jolly as his driver.

421
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,910
Mind-Boggling.

422
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,851
Both will work as a screwdriver.

423
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,354
He will drive the car.

424
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,426
And he'll screw Kapoor's happiness.

425
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,356
Fine.

426
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,693
From tomorrow, I am
JD's son Jolly, not you.

427
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,431
Goodbye.

428
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,390
Just a second.

429
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,471
Why did you call me in
this sauna for this meeting?

430
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,597
Because we know your reputation.

431
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,106
And sauna's the only place..

432
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,810
..Where you can't
steal anything from us.

433
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,477
Really?

434
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,645
What can he steal from the sauna?

435
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,481
Mamma mia.

436
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,922
The rascal stole my towel.

437
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,653
Now I will have to go home nude.

438
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,995
The stray will chase me mamma mia.

439
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,075
That's great. That's great.

440
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,975
This is what God wants.

441
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,950
This Real Kapoor sign
should be here and not there.

442
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,888
This is where you belong.

443
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,119
I am sorry.

444
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,722
I am really sorry, sir.

445
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,792
Let's start.

446
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,766
I am checking, sir.

447
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,497
JD's son will have to stand
in the middle of the road..

448
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,665
"Because of a driver's carelessness.

449
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,706
JD's son?

450
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,175
Yes, yes. JD's son.

451
00:23:57,736 --> 00:23:58,806
Check it.

452
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:03,080
Excuse me. I am Mr. Kapoor.
- As if I care.

453
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,218
Son. Maybe you didn't recognize me.

454
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,081
But I do recognize you.

455
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,021
You're JD's son, aren't you?

456
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,891
Oh my, God. How did you know?

457
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,792
I've got a very good idea.

458
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,492
As long as JD's
son's car isn't fixed..

459
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,660
..JD's son can rest in my house.

460
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,864
What is this "JD's son"?

461
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,769
My name is Jolly.

462
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:25,898
Maybe you don't know..

463
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,705
..But every month I write
out a check to my father.

464
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,006
Really?
- Yes.

465
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,774
And he signs it and sends it back.

466
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,709
Sense of humor.

467
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,111
Where is your house?

468
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,018
This is my house.

469
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,555
This house?

470
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,788
Sir, our car is bigger than that.

471
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,555
Wait, wait, wait.

472
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,557
It appears smaller.

473
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,689
But it's much bigger from inside.

474
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,166
Come. Come in.

475
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:57,229
Kapoor...sir.

476
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,135
Kapoor sir.

477
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,167
Your watch had fallen down.

478
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,038
All that staring was beneficial.

479
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,613
You can come in too.

480
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,944
I will give you tea and biscuits.

481
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,049
Come.

482
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,576
Meet my wife, Dolly.

483
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,586
Dolly.

484
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,624
Multi-billionaire JD's only son Jolly.

485
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,852
Jolly, Dolly.

486
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,188
Dolly, Jolly.

487
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,921
Let's play Holi.

488
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,996
Excuse me, sir.

489
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,929
Rather than living in this shanty..

490
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,932
..I will call a taxi to
take you to the airport.

491
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,593
You fool.

492
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,200
Look at the time.
We've missed our flight.

493
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,739
Now there are no flights for 24 hours.

494
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,171
That's great. That's great.

495
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,141
Superb.

496
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,575
Hi, dad.

497
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,610
Look. She's my daughter Bobby.

498
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,087
Look who is here?

499
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:50,023
Mr. JD's multi-billionaire son, Jolly.

500
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,793
Your jacket..
- This is pure leather.

501
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,992
I love leather.
- Leather.

502
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,295
Like this belt.

503
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,933
Can't say about the charmer..

504
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:04,030
..But this is made of pure
snake skin. - Snake's skin

505
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,336
And these shoes are crocodile leather.

506
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:07,666
Crocodile.

507
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,871
Sir, tell her about the leopard.
- Of course.

508
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,882
The seats in my car
are pure leopard skin.

509
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:14,746
Leopard.

510
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,343
The same leopard sir
ran over with is car.

511
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,690
Shut up!

512
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,926
You're a murderer!

513
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,660
Animal skins are supplied..

514
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,822
"Because of rich brats like you.

515
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,367
Animals die, and you're showing off.

516
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,166
If you ask me..

517
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:39,935
..I would rather skin you alive.

518
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,835
You should be hanged to death.

519
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,351
Jolly.

520
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,851
Don't be upset.

521
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,324
Actually my daughter loves animals.

522
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,289
Can't say about your daughter.

523
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,931
But I am missing my mother.
- What?

524
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:06,794
She used to curse me similarly..

525
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,634
..And I really liked hearing those.

526
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,774
Dear, keep thinking
about those memories..

527
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,308
..And my job will get easier.

528
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:14,775
What?

529
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,313
I mean let's do something else.

530
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,642
What? Eat?

531
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,114
Even dogs eat.

532
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,741
Do dogs drink?

533
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,648
Come on, come on.

534
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,345
Let's go to my bar. It'll be fun.

535
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,122
Get something to eat, go on.
- Yes.

536
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,020
Come on, come on. Please.

537
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:34,163
It's going to be when
you get a heart attack.

538
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:41,329
Jolly. It's quite late.

539
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,328
Stay back for the night.

540
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:47,140
How can you drive in
this drunken condition?

541
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,370
Hello.

542
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,707
I am the driver.

543
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:50,905
I will drive the car.

544
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,209
Rascal. How can the driver drive..

545
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,284
..When the master's right here?

546
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,311
Here you go.

547
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,445
Jolly.

548
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,122
What are your thoughts on marriage?

549
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:09,995
I want a girl that makes me rich.

550
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,691
Me too.

551
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,465
Sense of humor.

552
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,034
Son-in-law.

553
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,337
What did you say?

554
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,010
I said, son, here you go.

555
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,948
Can't say about that..

556
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:32,316
..But I really liked
hearing son-in-law.

557
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,288
Say it again.
- Son-in-law.

558
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,217
Again.
- Son-in-law.

559
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,491
Now you say, father-in-law.

560
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,357
Father-in-law.
- Father-in-law.

561
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,060
Father-in-law.

562
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,500
Son-in-law.

563
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,284
Daboo!

564
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,445
Daboo! Daboo!

565
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,452
Who's barking this
early in the morning?

566
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,387
It's my neighbor's Alsatian.

567
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:11,585
Hey Doberman Daboo.

568
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,133
So you showed your true colors.

569
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,962
You proved your bad blood.

570
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,766
Why are you barking?

571
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:23,896
Mind your language.

572
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:24,996
Show some respect.

573
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,337
Why are you abusing him
saying "Daboo, Daboo"?

574
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,878
Daboo's my name.
- Sorry.

575
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,038
Who are you? Where are you from?

576
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:31,978
Want a slap?

577
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,946
Do you know who I am?

578
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,345
Do you know who he is?

579
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,114
Do you know who he is?

580
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,484
This is my sure-shot,
hot-shot, future son-in-law.

581
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,551
And if anyone yells
at my father-in-law..

582
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:43,917
..Then I won't spare him.

583
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:47,087
You rascal, thief.

584
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,555
This Daboo is a thief.

585
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:51,833
What are you saying?

586
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,529
He stole the 'Real'
from my nameplate..

587
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,897
..And stuck it on to his nameplate.

588
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,506
I am Chintu Kapoor.

589
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,402
Kapoor and Real son.

590
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,808
How can you go in the wrong house?

591
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,112
I am sorry.

592
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,379
And now that fool Max says..

593
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,545
..That Daboo's house is right for him.

594
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,449
Of course. Money, girl, he's
getting everything readymade

595
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,117
Look, Max is no use to us now.

596
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,458
Chintu has seen Max in Daboo's house.
- Oh no.

597
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,587
What now?

598
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:21,863
Simple.

599
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,559
Now you'll have to find
a bigger rascal than Max.

600
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,130
Bigger rascal..

601
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,263
A bigger rascal than Max.

602
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,498
Jai.

603
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,399
Remember him in our college.
- Who?

604
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,943
Him?

605
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,074
Him.
- Yes, him.

606
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,340
Jolly, we cannot call him.

607
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,313
He's too dangerous.
- I know, I know.

608
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,318
But don't you want to
avenge your father? - Yes, but..

609
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,184
You won't find a bigger rascal in UK.

610
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,416
And what is this rascal's name?

611
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,250
Sunny.

612
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,027
Excuse me. Sunny?

613
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,292
He's inside.

614
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,457
Be careful guys, I
am trying to fix it.

615
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:00,001
It's broken.

616
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,265
Oh no.

617
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,973
Why are you tiring yourself?

618
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,876
I got your virgin.

619
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,252
I mean, your version.

620
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,084
Sit down, slowly.

621
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:26,993
Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

622
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,890
Thank you.

623
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:33,527
Buffoons, have my grapes.

624
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,479
One by one.

625
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,479
Slowly.

626
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,161
Mr. Sunny is a gem of a person.
- Yes.

627
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,531
But sometimes I lose my character.

628
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,539
Now let's talk about money.

629
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:15,042
Jai, give him 50,000 pounds as well.
- Yes.

630
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,271
Him too?

631
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,104
Give him too?

632
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,183
Who did you talk to earlier?

633
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:25,516
I hope you didn't approach Max?
- No, no.

634
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,521
Max...Max...I don't who he is.

635
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,556
Give the money.

636
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:29,556
Here's the money.

637
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,682
And..

638
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:35,293
Keep it in the middle.

639
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,387
In the middle.

640
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:43,270
Who's the monster in the photo?

641
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,734
He's not a monster.

642
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,033
He's my father.

643
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,377
And I am his sin.

644
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,712
I am sorry.

645
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,346
But our deal.

646
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:00,181
Out.

647
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,035
Mamma mia.

648
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,237
One minute. One minute.

649
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:28,044
Why didn't you tell Sunny about Max?

650
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,719
Don't ever mention
Max in front of Sunny.

651
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,681
Why?

652
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,486
Because if Sunny spots Max
then he will definitely kill

653
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:38,049
And if Max spots Sunny
then he will kill Sunny.

654
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,325
How did they become enemies?

655
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,731
Actually, the two of us, Max and
Sunny studied in the same college.

656
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,469
These two senior
citizens with you two children.

657
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,368
No, Sunny and Max were
in their final year..

658
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,031
..When we were in the first year.

659
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,733
And when we were in our final year..

660
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,073
..Sunny and Max were
still in their final year.

661
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,208
They were best of friends.

662
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,176
And one day during the
college farewell party.

663
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,147
"Papa plays the band."

664
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,118
"Acts as the principal himself."

665
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:42,180
"Makes a keep quiet rule."

666
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,821
"He always screams."

667
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,455
"You're an idiot."

668
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:49,395
"You're a fool."

669
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,398
"You still don't have the knowledge."

670
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,369
"You're still not of the
age to lock horns with me."

671
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,237
"Whatever...whatever we do."

672
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,341
"Papa plays the band."

673
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,541
"Papa plays the band."

674
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,512
"Papa plays the band."

675
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,381
"Papa plays the band."

676
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,643
"Days filled with flirting around."

677
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,235
"Every night party night."

678
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:43,144
"But papa's sitting on
our dreams like dynamite."

679
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:48,456
"But papa's sitting on
our dreams like dynamite."

680
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:49,422
"Dynamite."

681
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:50,492
"Dynamite."

682
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:51,525
"You're an idiot."

683
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,424
"You're a fool."

684
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,519
"You still don't have the knowledge."

685
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,431
"You're still not of the
age to lock horns with me."

686
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:02,300
"Whatever...whatever we do."

687
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,597
"Papa plays the band."

688
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,671
"Papa plays the band."

689
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:40,238
"Wonder why does he
always grill and fry us?"

690
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,945
"What's the problem if
we chill out a little?"

691
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,717
"What's the problem if
we chill out a little?"

692
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,512
"You're an idiot."

693
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,420
"You're a fool."

694
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,459
"You still don't have the knowledge."

695
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,462
"You're still not of the
age to lock horns with me."

696
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,329
"Whatever...whatever we do."

697
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,628
"Papa plays the band."

698
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,990
I am scared of the dark.

699
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,318
Come on, come in, come in.

700
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,452
Come in.

701
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,665
Finally I am alone with you,
and in a cupboard.

702
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,771
Sonia. Sonia. What are you doing?

703
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,433
You're my best friend's girlfriend.

704
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:50,512
Your best friend is hot,
but you are hotter.

705
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,673
Sonia, you've lost your mind.

706
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,772
What do you mean by..

707
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,447
What are you doing, Sunny?

708
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:03,581
Sunny.

709
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,558
Max. Max.

710
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,662
He was hitting on me, Max.

711
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,727
He knew that I am your girlfriend,
but still he was..

712
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:16,369
Sonia. From acting smart to sympathy.

713
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,700
Shut up, okay.

714
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,673
You call him your friend, Max.

715
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,343
He was all over me, Max.

716
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,004
Sonia, just get out of here now.

717
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,010
Get lost.

718
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,545
He's my friend.

719
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,381
He trusts me, okay.
- How could you?

720
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:34,546
Hey, Max. What's wrong with you?

721
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,824
Max. Max.

722
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,487
Max.

723
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,101
You're not worth it.

724
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,071
You're not my friend.

725
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,777
And she's worth it.

726
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,006
You hit me, for this
characterless girl.

727
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,053
Max.
- Sunny. Sunny.

728
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:14,830
Let go.
- Max.

729
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:15,659
What are you doing, Max?

730
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:16,891
Sunny.
- Let go.

731
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,422
Max.
- Sunny.

732
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,523
We're no longer friends.

733
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,694
Who wants to be
friends with you anyway?

734
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,576
I swear on Thames.

735
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,847
Max is going to be
right in the next house..

736
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,854
..Where we are sending Sunny.

737
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:44,723
If they come face to face
it'll be world war four.

738
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:45,885
Oh no.

739
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,452
Just a minute.

740
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,621
You go back to Max.

741
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,063
And I will stay with Sunny.

742
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,627
Under no circumstances..

743
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:55,398
..Can we let Sunny and
Max come face to face.

744
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,861
Yes.
- Yes.

745
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:01,510
Blabbering baboon, vibrating vagabond.

746
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,771
What did I do, Mr. Kapoor?

747
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:03,937
What did you do?

748
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,038
You got a wealthy
son-in-law for that Daboo.

749
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,743
You've piles in your brains. Piles.

750
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,916
What's done is done.

751
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,009
If he got a wealthy
son-in-law then so be it.

752
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:16,421
But I want a extremely
wealthy boy for my Henna.

753
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,755
Your wish is my command, Mr. Kapoor.

754
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,590
It's a snap for me.
- "Snap for me."

755
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,822
You think it's that easy?

756
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,829
Will he drop down from the sky?

757
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,176
Mamma Mia.

758
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,447
Mr. Kapoor, it's
such a romantic scene.

759
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,109
What is this?

760
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,545
Get up.

761
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,756
Are you fine, dear?

762
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,093
Out of the frying
pan...and into the fire.

763
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,958
Who are you?
- JD's only son.

764
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,555
Who is JD's son?

765
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,499
My daddy was taking me to
see some girl for my marriage.

766
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:01,831
He was taking me in his private jet..

767
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:05,135
..But when I found out,
I jumped out in mid-air..

768
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,870
"Because if he's JD
then I am JD's son.

769
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,618
JD's son.

770
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:18,846
He's JD's son.

771
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:19,751
He's JD's son.

772
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,846
Why are you tiring yourself

773
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,619
Sir. Sir.

774
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,256
Sir. Jolly sir.

775
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,655
Why are you spitting?

776
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,095
Thank God you're safe sir.

777
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,188
It had to be.

778
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:35,032
Because I had a soft landing.

779
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,767
Excuse me. Hello.

780
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:42,708
Who are you?

781
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,646
He's my bodyguard
cum driver cum pilot.

782
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,916
Sir. You're father Mr. JD
must be looking for you.

783
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,180
He can send the entire
army here to get you married.

784
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:52,981
Army?

785
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,114
So we'll have to go
underground for a few days.

786
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:58,819
We might have to find
a safe spot to hide.

787
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,620
Where will we find such a place?

788
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:06,691
I want a bungalow, wall,
barb-wire, garden, orchard.

789
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,633
I suggest that we hide in the bushes.

790
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,797
Let's go, sir.
- Sir, sir, sir.

791
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:15,302
We have a barb
- wire, bungalow and a wall.

792
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:16,934
You have this house.

793
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:17,910
What house?

794
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,141
This is your house, sir.

795
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,818
This house?

796
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,214
This house.
- Shut up. Get out of here.

797
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,549
Sir, please come.

798
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,849
That's fine, but why are you
sending your LAW officer..

799
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,050
..To my house?

800
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,854
He's coming to study your research.

801
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,155
He's a man of high post.

802
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,992
He'll do a survey on
how you look after Fifi.

803
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,324
You might win the LAW award, Henna.

804
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,329
He'll be there, right now.
Reaching anytime.

805
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,295
Bye.
- Okay, sir.

806
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,969
I'll be nice to him. Bye.

807
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,937
You'll be really happy to meet her.

808
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:45,871
I'm telling you.

809
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:46,839
Henna.

810
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,014
Do you know who's this?

811
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,345
Yes, I know.

812
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,710
He's here for me.

813
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,116
And from high above.

814
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,289
We'll have to go to my bedroom..

815
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,286
..For the job you're here for.

816
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,989
Shall we?

817
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,119
Excuse me.

818
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,790
Where are you going?

819
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:12,890
I am a bodyguard, sir.

820
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,766
You bodyguards take
your job too seriously.

821
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,095
Good.

822
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:21,074
But a bodyguard's job is to
break the attackers bones. - Yes.

823
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,611
But you look like a skeleton yourself

824
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:28,006
Seems like you started dieting,
but forgot to stop. - Sir.

825
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,318
Whose bodyguard were you earlier?

826
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,644
The President.

827
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,989
President of America?
- No.

828
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,384
President of Lions Club, Bhandup.

829
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,627
Bhandup?

830
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,792
Bloody... What is Bhandup?

831
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,659
Just a minute.

832
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:51,968
Yes.
- Henna.

833
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,133
Wonder what's wrong with Tommy.

834
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,212
He's had a rash since I
made him wear clothes.

835
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,336
What should I do now?

836
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,348
Do me a favour, he
must be feeling hot.

837
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:01,906
Please take the clothes off.

838
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,714
How's he feeling?
- Cool.

839
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,382
I don't know what's wrong with Tommy.
- Cool.

840
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,350
Very cool

841
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,695
Now on the bed.

842
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,358
Okay.

843
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,029
How's he feeling now?

844
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,935
I think he's feeling better.

845
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,163
Let me hear him bark.

846
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,369
Kinky.

847
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,804
Tommy, bark.

848
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,844
Bark, Tommy.

849
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,311
Very kinky.

850
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:35,749
Tommy.

851
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,379
I can't hear.

852
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,813
Louder

853
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,797
Why are you tiring yourself

854
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,374
Mind-boggling.

855
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,834
From the mosquito net.

856
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,972
You two had such a cute,
lovely meeting.

857
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,481
That means you don't feel
offended like your daughter?

858
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:10,444
Offended?

859
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,049
No, no, not at all.

860
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,986
First meeting should
always be memorable.

861
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:20,357
That means now.. I
should call you father

862
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:21,828
Meaning.

863
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,796
Father...in-law.

864
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,193
No. Father-in-law.

865
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,462
Son-in-law.

866
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,259
Father-in-law.

867
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,363
Let's have some sweets on that note.

868
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,806
Stop!

869
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:35,774
Hey, Bhandup.

870
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,342
Nothing. He's just
checking whether it's poisoned.

871
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,436
Clear.

872
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,013
The LAW officer didn't come there.

873
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,086
He had some personal problems.

874
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,151
Okay, bye.

875
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,881
Okay, sir. Thank you.

876
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,092
You like taking off
your clothes, don't you?

877
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,959
I'll teach you a lesson now.

878
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,090
Henna, you called.

879
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:05,329
Actually...it was my mistake.

880
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,342
I was talking on the
phone and you thought..

881
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,504
What did I think?

882
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,275
I am going through a
lot of stress right now.

883
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:17,079
My mind's completely on Fifi.

884
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:18,782
Who's Fifi?

885
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,319
My cute little pet.

886
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,187
Her wisdom tooth's aching.

887
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,326
And the dentists are
on a strike today.

888
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:31,456
If you can extract her tooth..
- Sir.

889
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:32,358
All okay, sir?

890
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,958
And who is Fifi?

891
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,805
You two go in, I'll be right with you.

892
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,344
What do you think Fifi would be?

893
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,878
A small dog, what else?

894
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,952
Fifi. Fifi. Fifi.

895
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:52,414
Fifi. Fifi.

896
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,510
Fifi.

897
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,527
Fifi.

898
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,192
Fifi.
- Fifu.

899
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:04,895
Fifi.

900
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:06,433
Fifi.

901
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,337
Fifi.

902
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,060
What do we do? Fifi.

903
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,636
Why are you tiring yourself

904
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,930
Papa Ranjeet.

905
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:50,000
Papa Ranjeet gave me these
sleeping tablets for an emergency.

906
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,477
We'll take these and fall asleep?
- Not us.

907
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:55,516
Then? - I've put many
butterflies to sleep with this.

908
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,179
So she's no match for it.

909
00:47:58,408 --> 00:47:59,546
Come on, Fifi.

910
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,526
Bobby.

911
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,537
Can't say about coins,
but I have changed.

912
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,907
You've opened my eyes.

913
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:22,500
I promise I will never
wear any accessory..

914
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,570
..Like belt, shoes,
jacket made of animal skin.

915
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,440
I wouldn't wear my own skin either.

916
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:30,540
By the way...

917
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,679
What's his name?

918
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,154
Nagraaj.
- Nagraaj?

919
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,055
So sweet, what a lovely name.

920
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:39,149
Nagraaj.

921
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,552
Anything else, or can I leave.

922
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:43,597
Please leave, please.

923
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,257
You must be busy.

924
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,198
I will talk to Nagraaj.

925
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,706
Nagraaj.

926
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,205
Come on.

927
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,212
Come on.

928
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:06,247
Why you..

929
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:07,413
You think you're tough.

930
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,081
You think you're tough.

931
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,525
You snakes are so boring.

932
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,722
The entire day all you do is..

933
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,524
What do you think?

934
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,362
I am scared of you.

935
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,097
Where's the teeth?

936
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:36,677
Fifi. Fifi.

937
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,454
The door's not opening.

938
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,388
Wonder why he's running?

939
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,251
Because Fifi is awake.

940
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,360
Fifi is awake.

941
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:50,629
Fifi is awake.

942
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:51,665
Forgive me.

943
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,098
Don't eat me.

944
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,231
Don't eat me.

945
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:58,000
Open the door.

946
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,604
High five. High five.

947
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,141
You can't do it.

948
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,642
You don't even have hands.

949
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,171
Come on, come on.

950
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:06,339
Come on, come on.

951
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,689
Let go, let go.

952
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,059
Save me. Save me.

953
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,789
You've robbed a snake.

954
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,461
The serpent is after us.

955
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,562
Open the door. Open the door.

956
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:26,725
Open the door.

957
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,128
Let go of my pant.

958
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,398
Open the door.
- Open the door.

959
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,233
He swallowed my hand.

960
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:39,109
Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!

961
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:51,787
Leave me. Let go of my bum

962
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,258
Let go of my bum.

963
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,436
Its out. Its out.

964
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,594
You're a genius.

965
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,499
What is it now?

966
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,507
What happened?

967
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,071
Look down.

968
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,851
No! No!

969
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,106
Can't say about Hindi, but
your Sindhi's really nice.

970
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:40,732
What did you say?

971
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:44,370
That snake attacked me so brutally.

972
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,546
Come with me, I will
show you something else.

973
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,620
Yes, but..
- Max. Max.

974
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,313
Listen to me.
- No, I am..

975
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:56,413
Max, listen to me.

976
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:02,822
What is he doing here?

977
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,194
What is he doing here?

978
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,329
Let him go.

979
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,761
What are you doing?
Think about the plan.

980
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,355
Leave him.

981
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,230
Be grateful that
there's a wall between us.

982
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,200
Or your body would've been lying here.

983
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:45,364
But nothing can stop
me from killing you.

984
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:48,500
Shut up you slimy pseudopodia.

985
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:52,779
How dare you attack my son-in-law?

986
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:53,813
Shut up, Chintu.

987
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,781
How dare you talk to
my son-in-law like this?

988
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,351
You shut up, Daboo.

989
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,578
Hey.
- Yes.

990
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,677
Don't you dare touch my husband.

991
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,279
I won't spare you.

992
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,790
Shut up you witch.

993
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,486
You rascal.

994
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,323
I will pull out your fake nose.

995
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,626
Correct.
- Botox hag.

996
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,202
How dare you talk to
my mother that way?

997
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,363
Hey Bombay duck, if you say
anything about my mother..

998
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,564
..Then I will gorge out your eyes.

999
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:21,199
You cheapskates, we don't want
to speak to cheapskates like

1000
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,902
You're a cheapskate,
so is your family.

1001
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,770
Shut up.
- You shut up.

1002
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,252
That was fun, Sweeto. Really.

1003
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:38,349
My son-in-law hates his son-in-law..

1004
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,918
..As much as I hate him.

1005
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,289
Cheers to him.

1006
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,957
What son-in-law, dad?

1007
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:46,928
Did you ask for my consent?

1008
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,602
I am not getting into the
hassle of marriage. Please.

1009
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,799
But you have to get
married sooner or later.

1010
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,433
No, dad. Don't force me into this.

1011
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,773
You can sit with your Jolly,
and I am leaving.

1012
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,869
Why are you so angry that
you're leaving the house?

1013
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,813
I am not leaving the house, dad.

1014
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,441
I told you.

1015
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,520
LAW award function is on the cruise.

1016
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,247
You know how important that is to me.

1017
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:08,923
You can go for the event if you want.

1018
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,025
But on one condition?

1019
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:11,883
What condition?

1020
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:15,462
You will have to take Jolly along.

1021
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,462
How did my voice echo?

1022
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:33,277
Such beautiful scenery.

1023
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:34,781
What a beautiful ocean.

1024
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,314
Look, madam.

1025
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:40,411
If you don't mind,
let's take a love dip.

1026
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,820
Just shut up and stop irritating me.

1027
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:45,757
What's wrong with you?

1028
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,293
It's such a big day for you?

1029
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,888
You're going to receive an
award for protecting animals

1030
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:51,897
What's wrong?

1031
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,692
I don't think so.

1032
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,061
Why am I telling you all this?

1033
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:57,064
Can you just leave me alone?

1034
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,635
I am already tensed.

1035
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:00,401
What are you tensed about?

1036
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,443
Tell me.
- About that slime Bobby.

1037
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:04,409
I feel she'll win today's award.

1038
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,571
I feel the same.

1039
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:13,344
But...what if that doesn't happen?
- Meaning?

1040
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,980
I mean if Henna's not
present for the award, then..

1041
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:21,619
..Can't say about the broom,
but you'll sweep the awards.

1042
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:23,922
But how is that possible.

1043
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:28,859
Can't say about George Michael,
but have faith in me.

1044
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:30,766
I have an idea.

1045
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,771
Can't say about Birla,
but Tata to you.

1046
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,643
Now Bobby will win.

1047
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,061
Now...Henna will win.

1048
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,728
Sleeping with the enemy.

1049
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,696
Where the hell am I?

1050
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:09,826
What just happened?

1051
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,803
I don't know how I got here..

1052
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,670
..But I know you're
responsible for it.

1053
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,867
Me?
- Yes?

1054
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:15,739
It must be you.

1055
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:18,039
It's not her it's him.

1056
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,047
It's not me it's him.

1057
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,672
He put it on me.

1058
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,806
Me?

1059
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,010
Tell them the truth.

1060
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,485
Didn't you put
chloroform on me like this?

1061
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:27,680
Chloroform?

1062
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,951
I am getting out of here.
- Me too.

1063
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:07,195
I looked everywhere, but
couldn't find anything to eat.

1064
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:09,856
But don't worry, I..
- I don't care.

1065
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,990
I am stuck on this
island because of you.

1066
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:14,031
There's no way to go back.

1067
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,533
I am hungry.

1068
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,127
Get something to eat.

1069
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,969
Dad has sent you to
look after me, right?

1070
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:21,064
So fine.

1071
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,768
You take care of me.

1072
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:27,039
As long as I am on this
island you will find food for me.

1073
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:28,945
Why are you still standing here? Go.

1074
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:32,049
Get out. Go get me some food.

1075
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,560
Coconut.

1076
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,939
You still have eyes for
others things, don't you?

1077
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,219
You want this coconut, don't you?

1078
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,122
Try and take it.

1079
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:12,725
Ten years later I've an
opportunity to settle the score.

1080
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,787
And there's no one to stop us today.

1081
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,185
Climb up, Max.

1082
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,402
What are you staring at?

1083
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:43,171
I saved you earlier as well,
from that girl..

1084
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:46,008
..Who would fall for anyone instantly.

1085
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,113
But there's no use telling you.

1086
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,308
You don't have any brains.

1087
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,874
Come on. Hit me.

1088
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,179
Come on.

1089
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,257
What are you staring at?

1090
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,227
I am not hitting you.

1091
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:03,425
I want to befriends.

1092
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,273
We're back. We're back. We're back.

1093
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:19,346
We're back. We're back. We're back.

1094
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,502
Resort?

1095
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:04,222
Island in the front,
and resort at the back.

1096
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,857
Excuse me. Where's food?

1097
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,328
Where's room?
- Shut up.

1098
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:11,454
Shut up.

1099
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:41,459
We've eaten to our hearts content,
but who will pay the bill?

1100
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,155
Don't worry?

1101
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,097
Your bill.

1102
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:50,466
Thank you, Mr. Jolly.

1103
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,238
Jolly?

1104
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:55,605
Here?

1105
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:57,401
Now straight.

1106
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,946
Fantastic. Alright girls,
take a break.

1107
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,071
Jlo.

1108
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,013
I found the towel, Jlo.

1109
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:02,912
Cover yourself.

1110
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:03,949
What the hell are you doing?

1111
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,246
Cover yourself.

1112
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,249
What do you mean by cover yourself?

1113
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,621
Covered up girls in
Sosa's photo shoot.

1114
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,291
Jlo. Shoot such bold photos.

1115
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,126
I will make you rich and famous.

1116
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,928
Have faith on Sosa.

1117
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,397
Let's go.

1118
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,466
Jlo. Jolly's going to
tell his father about you.

1119
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,236
He will talk to him?
- Yes.

1120
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:32,541
He takes two steps
ahead and four back.

1121
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,208
Take one step ahead, Jolly.

1122
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:37,909
Take me home.

1123
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:41,247
And I will wear a
burkha all my life for you.

1124
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:51,064
These two? Here?

1125
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:53,328
What are you two doing here?

1126
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,398
And how did Gabbar and Thakur..

1127
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:56,595
..Turn into Jai and Veeru?

1128
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,429
The day we vented out
our 'Sholay' (anger)..

1129
01:04:58,527 --> 01:04:59,904
..We became best friends.

1130
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,099
Fantastic, guys.

1131
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,040
But where are the girls.

1132
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,012
We'll talk about that later,
first lets get something to eat.

1133
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,604
Fine. Lunch is on me.

1134
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,043
Okay.
- Really? - Here you go.

1135
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,050
Why you... my wallet.

1136
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,143
Thieves.

1137
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,587
You picked my wallet.

1138
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:50,452
Thanks.

1139
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,552
I had to help.

1140
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:58,427
Because a known enemy is far
better than an unknown friend.

1141
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:14,979
Oh my, God. What an adventurous story

1142
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,483
Then the girls must be famished.

1143
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:18,347
Yes.

1144
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,717
Then let's go tell the
girls about the resort. - Yes.

1145
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,284
Then let's go tell those
girls about the resort.

1146
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,516
Yes.
- Come on.

1147
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,558
Let's go. Let's go.

1148
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,355
Why are you tiring yourself?

1149
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:34,028
Henna.
- Bobby.

1150
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:47,407
Are you fine?

1151
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,076
Bobby.
- Hey, its Henna. - Yes.

1152
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,525
You know, Henna.

1153
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:05,091
500 kilometers is made
up of 500,000 meters.

1154
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,723
500 kilometers?

1155
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,730
You two walked 500 kilometers?

1156
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,361
Can't say about Ninja..

1157
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,461
..But we've become turtles.

1158
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:14,507
We crawled back 600 kilometers.

1159
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,474
You walked 500
kilometers and came back 600?

1160
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:19,637
We were lost for 100 kilometers.

1161
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:22,147
We searched the entire jungle..

1162
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,117
..And brought this for you.

1163
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:27,448
What are you doing?

1164
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:30,557
I wanted to see it for one last time.

1165
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,757
Thank you.

1166
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,731
Won't you two eat?

1167
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:45,465
Now. Seeing you eat is enough for us.

1168
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,667
That was a empty stomach burp.

1169
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,145
Our system is a complete mess.

1170
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:57,149
And look, we've become friends now.

1171
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:01,278
This place has had it
effect on us as well.

1172
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:06,122
And do you know what
we brought for you?

1173
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,627
Gulab Jamun.' (Sweet)

1174
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,219
Gulab Jamun.'

1175
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:11,092
Yes, it means.

1176
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,430
Jamun' (grapes)...and 'Gulab' (rose)

1177
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:30,441
"I am in love with you."

1178
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:38,625
"I am in love with you."

1179
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,221
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1180
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:49,563
"I am in love with you."

1181
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,239
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1182
01:08:56,265 --> 01:09:00,577
"The heart's been up to mischief."

1183
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:04,113
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1184
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,381
"When did this happen?"

1185
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,583
"How strange is this?"

1186
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,890
"We didn't knew."

1187
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:20,328
"My hatred's turned into love."

1188
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,598
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1189
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:31,441
"I am in love with you."

1190
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,940
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1191
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:10,645
"Let me do something-something."

1192
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:15,786
"Don't deny me today."

1193
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:19,448
"Let me do some thinking."

1194
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:24,263
"Give me the time."

1195
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,457
"Tell me."

1196
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,501
"Tell me. Tell me."

1197
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:33,436
"What you've been hesitating to say."

1198
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:36,834
"What's the hurry."

1199
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:41,811
"This is just the beginning."

1200
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:45,716
"Pain's also given me relief."

1201
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:50,846
"Pain's also given me relief."

1202
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:53,919
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1203
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:01,696
"I am in love with you."

1204
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:05,267
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1205
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,000
"Dreaming."

1206
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,007
"I am dreaming."

1207
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:45,936
"About the time we spent."

1208
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,810
"Waiting."

1209
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,009
"I am waiting."

1210
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:54,919
"Wonder when those
moments will come back again."

1211
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,856
"Why this distance?"

1212
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:03,863
"Why this aloofness?"

1213
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:07,731
"You can take me in your arms."

1214
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:12,000
"First marry me."

1215
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:15,940
"How do I tell you
about my condition?"

1216
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:20,910
"How do I tell you
about my condition?"

1217
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:24,475
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1218
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:31,921
"I am in love with you."

1219
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:35,652
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1220
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:43,069
"The heart's been up to mischief."

1221
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:46,505
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1222
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:51,702
"When did this happen?"

1223
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,905
"How strange is this?"

1224
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:58,417
"We didn't knew."

1225
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:02,956
"My hatred's turned into love."

1226
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:06,426
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1227
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:14,032
"I am in love with you."

1228
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:17,766
"Sweetheart, do you know?"

1229
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:46,995
You try.

1230
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,505
Bring out the inner animal.

1231
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,040
Watch again.

1232
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,151
I cannot do it. How can you do it?

1233
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,114
You've to bring out
the animal inside you.

1234
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:08,950
I have a suggestion.

1235
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:10,182
Give me your hand.

1236
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,461
What a couple.

1237
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:20,591
What a couple.

1238
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,134
Uncle. Uncle.

1239
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:23,828
Not uncle.

1240
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:25,469
Father-in-law.

1241
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:26,972
Future father-in-law.

1242
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:29,633
And to turn this
future into your present..

1243
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:33,975
..You will have to talk
to your father about this.

1244
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,139
No, no, no.

1245
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:36,773
Why will he talk to JD sir?

1246
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,476
He won't.
- Hey you.

1247
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:39,712
What's wrong with you?

1248
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,549
We aren't talking to your father?

1249
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:42,644
Son.
- No, sir.

1250
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:45,623
Call JD sir.
- Sure, uncle. Sure.

1251
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:46,522
JD sir.

1252
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:47,753
I want to talk to my daddy.

1253
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,022
Security, my phone.

1254
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:52,828
Dad, your son.

1255
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:54,958
Daddy?
- Yes, its your son speaking.

1256
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,000
JD.

1257
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,128
Daddy.

1258
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:58,227
I am in love.

1259
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,905
Yes, dad. Your son is in love.

1260
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,167
Can't say about BBC..

1261
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:03,771
..But I've got news for you.

1262
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:04,936
I am in love.

1263
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:07,606
What?

1264
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,649
You don't like my choice.

1265
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:12,077
Fine, dad.

1266
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:16,244
From now on I will leave
your house and live with them.

1267
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,856
From today this is my house.
I will stay right here.

1268
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:20,654
He's leaving his father.

1269
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:22,627
But his father won't leave him.

1270
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:23,696
You leave it to me.

1271
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:25,890
Father, I am leaving you.

1272
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:29,298
Son. Its okay to leave your father..

1273
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:32,162
..But not his wealth.

1274
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:33,766
What?

1275
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,900
Do you love my wealth or me?

1276
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,807
Wealth! No, no I love you.

1277
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,541
If you want I... I can get
you two engaged tomorrow.

1278
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,584
Dad, I am getting engaged tomorrow.

1279
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,675
Your son is getting
engaged tomorrow. Bye.

1280
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:49,119
Dad. I am getting engaged tomorrow.

1281
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,681
And you are no invited.

1282
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:57,023
Son-in-law.
- Father-in-law.

1283
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:58,320
Come, Henna.

1284
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,860
Let's have some dinner.

1285
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:03,264
What's going on?

1286
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,266
He left his father..

1287
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:07,807
..And you fixed your
daughter's engagement.

1288
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,844
I...have a plan.

1289
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,905
What's the emergency?

1290
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,245
Why did you call us at midnight?

1291
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,718
To tell you about my father JD.

1292
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,281
If you're willing pay
us 50,000 pounds extra..

1293
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:24,649
..Then tell us about your father.

1294
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:25,690
Right?

1295
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,055
I am serious, guys.
- Just a minute.

1296
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:30,119
Though fake, but you
talked to JD on the phone.

1297
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:33,723
At any cost, JD should never
learn about this lie. That's all.

1298
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:34,960
I've known you since college.

1299
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,003
Why are you so scared of your father?

1300
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,160
Fine, I am scared.

1301
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,637
I am a coward. Okay.

1302
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,003
My father should never
know about this, okay.

1303
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,336
Coward. Fine, let's forget it.

1304
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:44,110
You will have to tell us today.

1305
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:45,041
What do I tell you?

1306
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,168
Tell us.
- Jolly, tell us.

1307
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,246
What is it? What is the problem?

1308
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:48,178
Tell us. Tell us.
- Tell us.

1309
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,045
You want to hear,
don't you? Then listen.

1310
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:01,093
No one knows about the secret..

1311
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:02,685
.. That I am going to tell you today.

1312
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,262
30 years ago, the
Gangapur area of Maharashtra..

1313
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:11,065
..Was ruled by terror.

1314
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,303
He was terror for the landlords..

1315
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,840
..But a messiah for the villagers.

1316
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,913
Even fear, feared him.

1317
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:27,181
He was Jagga Dacoit.

1318
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,115
Jagga Dacoit had only one weakness.

1319
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:32,818
His childhood friend,
Superintendent of Police..

1320
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,224
..Batook Patel.

1321
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:38,092
When the police from 700
villages couldn't catch him..

1322
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:41,929
..Then Batook Patel
asked him to surrender..

1323
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:44,129
..For the sake of their friendship.

1324
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:30,807
Hail Goddess!

1325
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,909
Hail Goddess!

1326
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,137
I gave you my word.

1327
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:55,808
And Jagga can die or kill

1328
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:58,037
..to keep his word.

1329
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:00,135
You did the right thing, Jagga.

1330
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:02,443
You explained it to me right, Batook.

1331
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:08,386
The father's had
deeds can haunt the son.

1332
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:13,253
And ever son wants his
father to raise his hands..

1333
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:17,524
..In order to bless him,
not to fire a gun.

1334
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:21,093
I have another request.
- What?

1335
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:27,998
I want our friendship
to turn into a relation.

1336
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:31,802
My daughter and your son.

1337
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:40,484
Fine.

1338
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,887
I give you my word.

1339
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:51,227
My son will marry only your daughter.

1340
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:55,460
And I will plead to the government..

1341
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:58,037
..To give Jagga minimum punishment.

1342
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:02,302
So that he can start a new life soon.

1343
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:05,544
Hail Goddess!

1344
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,543
Hail Goddess!

1345
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:20,827
JD. Meaning Jagga Dacoit.

1346
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,086
After serving 14
years of imprisonment..

1347
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:28,860
..Jagga Dacoit has now become
London's JD with his hard work.

1348
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:32,336
I hid another thing from you.
- What?

1349
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,873
My real name isn't Jolly.
- Then?

1350
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:38,976
Only a dacoit can give
his son such a name.

1351
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:43,843
My real name is Jwala (Fire).

1352
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:45,842
Jwala

1353
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,184
This is why.

1354
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,221
This is why I
changed my name to Jolly.

1355
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:50,488
Now look.

1356
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:53,355
Don't give JD an opportunity
to turn into Jagga Dacoit.

1357
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:55,621
Don't even wander
around my house, okay.

1358
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:58,227
Now let's just
concentrate on one thing.

1359
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,999
Mission..
- Istanbul?

1360
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:01,431
No.
- Mission Kashmir?

1361
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,127
No.
- Mission Impossible?

1362
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:04,397
No, no.

1363
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:06,267
Mission engagement.

1364
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:08,301
Mission engagement!

1365
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:10,867
Yes. Yes.

1366
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:16,438
Bless you.

1367
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:18,245
Congratulations on
your engagement, Jolly.

1368
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,546
Congratulations, Jolly.

1369
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:21,985
Today is a very jolly day for me.

1370
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:27,057
Congratulations, children.

1371
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:28,650
Congratulations. Congratulations.

1372
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,190
Bless you.

1373
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:40,228
Father-in-law, can I
ask you something?

1374
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:41,432
Yes, my boy.

1375
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:45,501
Where are you taking
us with a blindfold?

1376
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:48,379
Stupendous surprise.

1377
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,074
I love surprises.

1378
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:03,189
Come on, get down. Get down.

1379
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:06,023
Don't take your blindfold off.

1380
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:07,293
We are not, father-in-law.

1381
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:08,595
Stand here. Stand here. Stand here.

1382
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,068
That's it.

1383
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:12,101
Now take off the blindfold.

1384
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:17,302
Do you like it? Are you shocked?

1385
01:22:17,365 --> 01:22:19,470
Are you stunned?

1386
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:24,006
Jolly. This is your engagement gift.

1387
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,685
Jolly got engaged.

1388
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:33,482
Oh, God.

1389
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,151
Oh my, God. This is my house.
- Yes.

1390
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,595
Oh my, God. This is my house!

1391
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,167
This is my father,
Jagga Dacoit's house.

1392
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:44,036
Dacoit Jagga.

1393
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:03,517
How did you like my surprise?

1394
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:05,387
There was once a price on his head..

1395
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,051
..And now he has brought
us here for a surprise.

1396
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:17,401
Uncle. Its mind-blowing from outside.

1397
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:18,631
Now let's go.
- Come on.

1398
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:20,001
Quiet.

1399
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:21,774
Shocked, right?

1400
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:23,235
Shocked..

1401
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:24,639
Why are you nodding your head?

1402
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,474
Is this your father's house?

1403
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:31,676
Papa.
- Oh my, God.

1404
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,207
Hail Goddess.

1405
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:25,933
Jolly, only a son can
calm his father down.

1406
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,269
Go and emotionally handle him.

1407
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:29,501
Go on. Go.

1408
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:43,315
Who are you?

1409
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:45,181
Try to understand.

1410
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:46,589
What's there to understand?

1411
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:50,957
I can see everything clearly.

1412
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:55,968
He thinks Jolly got engaged.'

1413
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:00,231
No one will come
between father and son.

1414
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:02,174
No one will.

1415
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:08,073
Sir. I will have to interfere.

1416
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:11,980
Because, JD sir, I am
your son's new driver.

1417
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:13,581
But also an old friend.

1418
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:16,349
Your son made a mistake.

1419
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:17,583
Let it be.

1420
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,251
He's your son.

1421
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:21,519
And JD sir.

1422
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:28,558
Every son wants his father to
raise his hands to bless him

1423
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,999
..not to fire a gun.

1424
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:35,174
Every son wants his father to
raise his hands to bless him

1425
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,133
..not to fire a gun.'

1426
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:46,482
Seems like you have
given someone your word.

1427
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:51,122
If your son's no more, then
what good is your promise?

1428
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,281
Wow. No showdown.

1429
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:55,483
Instead he's pacifying his
father with his volume down.

1430
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:56,722
This is our son-in-law.

1431
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,195
I suggest, JD sir..

1432
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:00,392
..Give them a place in
your heart and home.

1433
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:02,396
Try to understand.

1434
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,264
Until then I will break this relation.

1435
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:05,531
I give you my word.

1436
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,639
And I've complete faith on my promise.

1437
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:12,735
Because I...am a devotee
of 'Bhadrakaali' (Goddess).

1438
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:15,607
Hail Goddess!

1439
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:20,177
Hail Goddess?

1440
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:21,720
Hail Goddess?

1441
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,762
What the son did was wrong?

1442
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:42,366
But is the father doing
the right thing today?

1443
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:43,702
Tell me.

1444
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:45,840
A father is elder

1445
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:50,112
But he has a bigger heart as well.

1446
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:55,518
If you forgive your son today,
then JD will lose..

1447
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:59,919
..But a father will win.

1448
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:01,421
No, don't cry.

1449
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:08,498
Today a father has bowed
before his son's happiness.

1450
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:19,607
Congratulations.

1451
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:21,203
Congratulations.

1452
01:27:21,269 --> 01:27:23,545
Children. Come, take his blessings.

1453
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:32,783
Come.

1454
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:40,823
Wonderful mansion. By the way,
what would be the square foot area?

1455
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:42,827
Around?

1456
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:44,896
No answer.

1457
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:46,297
Come in, come on.
- Let's go.

1458
01:27:46,561 --> 01:27:47,699
Come on.

1459
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:50,572
What the..

1460
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:53,778
I can understand
Jolly taking blessings.

1461
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:55,675
But why did the driver?

1462
01:27:56,671 --> 01:27:59,277
Something doesn't fit.

1463
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:02,217
Something's surely wrong.

1464
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:11,890
"Lend me...a kiss."

1465
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:17,203
"And take Middlesex,
Trafalgar square in return."

1466
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:20,898
Stop it.

1467
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:25,344
Jolly got engaged and..

1468
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:27,672
..The driver's
celebrating honeymoon with her.

1469
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,881
Oh, God. Such a big mess.

1470
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:32,943
I will go tell Bhau right away.

1471
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:40,886
Jolly sir.

1472
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:42,723
Hey. How dare you?

1473
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:44,455
How could he barge in like this?

1474
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:46,396
Without knocking.
- Come out.

1475
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:47,865
Come on.
- What are you gesturing?

1476
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:50,333
If I punch you, you'll
keep doing that all your life.

1477
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,496
Jolly sir.
- Why don't you tell him to get out?

1478
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,698
Hail Goddess.

1479
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,476
Have you lost your mind?
- Jolly sir, let's go.

1480
01:28:57,532 --> 01:28:59,443
Get out of the room right now.
- Try to understand.

1481
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:01,375
Everything will be clear.

1482
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:02,847
See for yourself.
- Get out.

1483
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:04,314
Next time if you
attempt anything like this..

1484
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:05,544
..I will throw you out of the house.

1485
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:11,881
What do I say, father?

1486
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,520
Save me, God.

1487
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:19,526
Bhau. He was inside.

1488
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:20,725
See, sir.

1489
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:24,793
She threatened to throw
Jolly sir out in a single day.

1490
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:29,002
I've started the spark, we've to
wait until it turns into a fire.

1491
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:31,239
Believe me.

1492
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:32,437
I am..

1493
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:39,450
Do whatever you feel is right?
- Yes, sir.

1494
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:47,725
"She's taken the bait."

1495
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:53,757
Oh, God. He's such a rascal.
What a mess he's..

1496
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:57,299
Uncle. Uncle.

1497
01:29:57,825 --> 01:30:00,897
You'll be really shocked to
hear what I am going to say.

1498
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:03,334
I think there's
something in your mouth.

1499
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,378
Finish it first then talk to me.
- There's nothing.

1500
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:06,673
I was saying..

1501
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,578
..The wrong man is
hitting on your daughter.

1502
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:13,751
What? - Yes, go see for
yourself if you don't believe me.

1503
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:16,345
Your girl's taken the bait.

1504
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,982
You wait.
- Yes. What wait?

1505
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:22,858
You're evergreen Henna.

1506
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:36,467
What the..

1507
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:42,542
The right man's inside with my
daughter, you illiterate fool.

1508
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:46,751
What kind of a father is he?

1509
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:49,717
A groom cum driver for his daughter.

1510
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:52,718
The father's a
cheapskate and so is his daughter.

1511
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,793
I swear something's fishy.

1512
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,728
Mind-blasting shock absorbers.

1513
01:30:58,786 --> 01:30:59,924
What happened?

1514
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:01,694
UK's Forbes magazine..

1515
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:03,861
..Has chosen Mr. JD
as Man of the Year.

1516
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:06,402
Taking his firms, companies, bonds..

1517
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:10,466
..Mr. JD's personal asset
accounts to five billion pounds.

1518
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:11,908
Can you believe it?
- Listen. - Yes.

1519
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:13,673
He's here.
- JD sir.

1520
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:15,744
Good morning, JD sir. Good morning.
How are you this morning?

1521
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:17,439
I've been sitting at
your home since morning..

1522
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:19,678
..Like the third
umpire to see your empire.

1523
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,619
I would like to see your companies,
office etcetera.

1524
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:24,020
If you don't mind?

1525
01:31:24,445 --> 01:31:27,483
I am heading to the office,
you can come along.

1526
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:29,027
Wow.
- Patil. - Yes.

1527
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:30,758
Get the car.
- Fine.

1528
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:34,560
Hey, driver. Come here!

1529
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:43,375
Why are they both coming together?

1530
01:31:45,466 --> 01:31:47,537
Driver, get the car quickly.

1531
01:31:50,438 --> 01:31:52,509
Jolly, you will come along, won't you?

1532
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:57,612
Papa, coffee.
- Why are you serving me coffee?

1533
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:00,122
Give it to my future son-in-law.

1534
01:32:01,048 --> 01:32:03,790
One coffee, two people.

1535
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:06,654
Now let's watch who she
serves the coffee too.

1536
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:08,762
Come, come on.

1537
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:10,996
Give it.

1538
01:32:11,425 --> 01:32:12,563
She is heading towards you.

1539
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:13,931
We'll be caught.

1540
01:32:13,995 --> 01:32:16,032
Serve coffee to Jolly.

1541
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:18,603
Come on.

1542
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:21,510
Coffee. Coffee. Coffee. Coffee.

1543
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:38,092
A burnt man got burnt further.

1544
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:07,719
Good shot, son-in-law.

1545
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:09,120
You're playing beautifully.

1546
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:10,491
It's entirely my fault.

1547
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:12,929
I always thought
tennis is a two-player game.

1548
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,191
But you are playing beautifully.
Please, carry one. Carry on.

1549
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:21,867
Great.

1550
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:23,665
I am getting a call, Jolly.

1551
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:25,002
But you continue playing.

1552
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:26,838
Carry on.

1553
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:30,610
Hello.
- I wish you were here today, Daboo.

1554
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:32,885
Do you know where my daughter is?

1555
01:33:33,574 --> 01:33:35,713
JD's house.
- JD?

1556
01:33:35,876 --> 01:33:36,980
Yes, JD.

1557
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:40,853
But right now in front of my eyes..
- There's darkness, isn't it?

1558
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:43,790
Wont you say "Superb" now?

1559
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:46,825
Didn't I say, "Wait and watch".

1560
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:48,833
I will get the richest son-in-law.

1561
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:51,230
Now you know what your stature is.

1562
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:58,506
If JD's son is Chintu's son-in-law,
then who is he?

1563
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:02,708
Jolly.
- Yes.

1564
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:05,216
That's enough for today.
Game set and match.

1565
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:09,049
Come, I will take you on along drive.

1566
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:10,783
"Papa plays the band."

1567
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,587
"Papa plays the band."

1568
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:18,230
"Papa plays the band."

1569
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:26,264
Trouble. Trouble. Trouble.

1570
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:27,965
Look

1571
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:35,236
Hide me. Hide me.

1572
01:34:36,237 --> 01:34:39,912
Jolly. Where are we?

1573
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:41,620
Can't say about Slumdog..

1574
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,883
..But this is a millionaire's house.

1575
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:45,218
Millionaire.

1576
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:48,790
Understand.
- Where are you going?

1577
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:50,726
I'll go handle Jagga.

1578
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:51,923
Don't worry. Go on.

1579
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:53,963
Whose house?
- Whose?

1580
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:55,762
Whose.
- Whose?

1581
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:57,234
Whose?
- Must be someone's.

1582
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,599
This is JD's house.

1583
01:34:58,659 --> 01:34:59,797
This is JD's house.

1584
01:35:04,632 --> 01:35:07,010
JD's house. JD's house.
Jagga Dacoit's house.

1585
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:08,775
Jagga Dacoit's son Jolly.

1586
01:35:08,836 --> 01:35:09,974
Jolly's house, that means..

1587
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:11,983
My house. This is my house.

1588
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:14,348
I haven't been home for
a long time, so I forgot.

1589
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:16,218
Did someone change the color?

1590
01:35:17,144 --> 01:35:20,648
The color hasn't changed jolly has.
- What are you saying?

1591
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,059
Should I go? No, no.

1592
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:25,720
Hey. He's Chintu's
son-in-law's servant.

1593
01:35:25,786 --> 01:35:27,026
Hey you, come here.

1594
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:29,090
Why, why are you moving to and fro?

1595
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:30,294
Here.
- Should I go? No, no.

1596
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:31,796
Come here.

1597
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:33,930
Coming, coming.

1598
01:35:34,128 --> 01:35:35,334
What are you doing here?

1599
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:39,201
Sir, your neighbor's
son-in-law fired me.

1600
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:41,610
But thanks to Jolly sir who
gave me a job with JD sir.

1601
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:42,841
Glory to Jolly sir.

1602
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:45,042
Wow. Superb. Superb.
- Yes.

1603
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:46,915
So he's real Jolly.

1604
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:49,780
Real Jolly? You doubted me.

1605
01:35:49,844 --> 01:35:51,983
No, no, never.

1606
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,823
Come on, let's go.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1607
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:56,828
Not back.
- Then?

1608
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,857
Inside the house to meet JD sir.

1609
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:01,099
JD's hereto see you himself.

1610
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:11,105
I've understood everything.

1611
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:15,680
I will fulfill the duty of a father.

1612
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:18,076
You got engaged.

1613
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:20,849
But I will get you married.

1614
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:26,954
And till they get married
your all welcome to stay here.

1615
01:36:28,082 --> 01:36:29,220
Come.

1616
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:30,793
Come, dear.

1617
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:32,125
I am very happy, JD sir.

1618
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:33,790
I am really very happy

1619
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:35,325
Thank you. Thank you.

1620
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:36,901
Thank you. Thank you.

1621
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,398
How did this happen?

1622
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,217
How...how did you do all this?

1623
01:36:57,111 --> 01:36:58,886
I went to JD sir and said..

1624
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:03,791
.."JD sir, Jolly's friend and
her fiancee are waiting outside".

1625
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:07,799
"His father is
against their marriage."

1626
01:37:08,022 --> 01:37:11,026
And I said "if you let
Jolly's friend stay for few days..

1627
01:37:11,091 --> 01:37:15,437
"..In your house and heart,
then Jolly will be really happy.."

1628
01:37:15,796 --> 01:37:17,104
"..and pleased, and
according to my planning.."

1629
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:20,077
"..Henna will be out of this house."
- Wow.

1630
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:22,414
But, Sunny, I can't believe this.

1631
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:26,240
You convinced dacoit Jagga.
- Yes.

1632
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:29,186
It was so easy that I
pulled it off with my left hand.

1633
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:30,381
Left hand

1634
01:37:31,478 --> 01:37:32,855
Leave me.

1635
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:36,017
Leave me.
- Please, sir.'

1636
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:39,264
Leave me.
- I won't let go.'

1637
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:42,164
Please accept your son's friend sir.

1638
01:37:43,924 --> 01:37:45,961
For the sake of Goddess Bhadrakaali.

1639
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:50,072
Hail Goddess Bhadrakaali.

1640
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:51,968
Hail Goddess Bhadrakaali.

1641
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:53,136
Fine.

1642
01:38:02,743 --> 01:38:03,915
Sunny.

1643
01:38:04,211 --> 01:38:05,747
Where are you lost?

1644
01:38:07,314 --> 01:38:08,554
Everything's set now.

1645
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:10,155
Nothing's set yet.

1646
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:11,787
Daboo and Chintu are here..

1647
01:38:11,852 --> 01:38:14,389
..To get their daughter
married to JD's only son.

1648
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:15,832
Oh, no.

1649
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:19,497
That means if Daboo and
Chintu come face to face..

1650
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,103
Oh, no.
- Oh my, God.

1651
01:38:46,287 --> 01:38:47,823
What are you doing here?

1652
01:38:47,888 --> 01:38:49,231
Why are you imitating me?

1653
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:50,394
What are you doing here?

1654
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:53,233
I am in my relative JD's house.

1655
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:54,432
There you go again.

1656
01:38:54,828 --> 01:38:57,274
I am in my relative JD's house.

1657
01:38:57,331 --> 01:38:59,311
You terrorizing octopus.

1658
01:38:59,566 --> 01:39:01,341
Trying to spread your tentacles here.

1659
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:02,813
What are you doing here?

1660
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:05,043
Security.
- Security. - Security.

1661
01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:06,641
Security. Take him away.

1662
01:39:06,907 --> 01:39:08,045
Security.
- Calm down.

1663
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:09,346
Calm down father-in-law.

1664
01:39:11,111 --> 01:39:13,489
You want to know what
that imposter is doing here.

1665
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:17,926
I will tell you how
this Chintu came here.

1666
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:20,429
Actually, that muscleman..

1667
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:22,426
..The one who's with the imposter.

1668
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:24,932
Do you know who he is?
- No.

1669
01:39:25,893 --> 01:39:27,304
He's my brother.
- Brother?

1670
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:32,401
Not real. He's an illegitimate son.

1671
01:39:32,866 --> 01:39:34,311
Illegitimate?
- Yes.

1672
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:37,078
Illegitimate? Whose?

1673
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:39,410
Hers.

1674
01:39:39,506 --> 01:39:41,213
Our maid Simi.

1675
01:39:41,275 --> 01:39:42,379
Where? Where?

1676
01:39:42,843 --> 01:39:44,049
Look down, not up.

1677
01:39:50,184 --> 01:39:52,164
She's his mother.

1678
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:53,927
Oh, no.

1679
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:56,065
Such a big..

1680
01:39:56,323 --> 01:39:58,098
JD sir had such a little affair.

1681
01:40:00,561 --> 01:40:02,598
"0 girl, you're mine."

1682
01:40:02,863 --> 01:40:04,604
"0 girl, you're mine."

1683
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:07,105
"0 girl, you're mine."

1684
01:40:07,167 --> 01:40:09,272
"0 girl, you're mine."

1685
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:10,974
"0 girl, you're mine."

1686
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:13,510
"0 girl, you're mine."

1687
01:40:13,574 --> 01:40:17,181
"0 girl, you're mine."

1688
01:40:17,478 --> 01:40:20,254
Jolly, you've given
me such a jolly news.

1689
01:40:20,314 --> 01:40:22,089
Give me a hug.

1690
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:24,060
Superb! Sixer! That's great.

1691
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:25,290
That's great.

1692
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:28,663
All my life he
taunted me as illegitimate.

1693
01:40:29,223 --> 01:40:32,067
And now he'll be branded as one.

1694
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:34,031
Superb. Superb.

1695
01:40:34,094 --> 01:40:37,166
Every doctor wants
his son to be a doctor.

1696
01:40:37,231 --> 01:40:39,370
Every actor wants
his son to be a actor.

1697
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:41,674
Destiny gave an illegitimate son..

1698
01:40:41,935 --> 01:40:43,107
..A illegitimate son-in-law.

1699
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:46,446
The legitimate one ended up
with the illegitimate one..

1700
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:50,022
..And the illegitimate one,
with the legitimate.

1701
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:51,647
Bravo, son-in-law.

1702
01:41:01,955 --> 01:41:05,402
Its bad.
- Really, it's really bad.

1703
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:10,174
We're helpless before destiny.
- Yes.

1704
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:12,335
We're just puppets in its hands.

1705
01:41:13,534 --> 01:41:17,607
Now that they're engaged,
what can we do?

1706
01:41:18,505 --> 01:41:20,041
Let's go with the flow.

1707
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:23,312
So what if the
son-in-law has such a big flaw.

1708
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:24,685
Let's go with the flow.

1709
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:29,025
My sympathies are with you. Cheer up.

1710
01:41:31,285 --> 01:41:33,356
His sympathies are with me?

1711
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:35,528
He imitated me again.

1712
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:41,195
Look, didn't I tell you?
That's where he will be.

1713
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:43,707
Come on, I will make you successful.

1714
01:41:44,331 --> 01:41:45,969
Leave her hand.

1715
01:41:46,033 --> 01:41:47,273
What are you doing here?

1716
01:41:47,334 --> 01:41:49,405
Go and live happily
with both your wives.

1717
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:51,211
Look, Jlo. This is
our personal matter.

1718
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:52,511
And a misunderstanding
about the two wives.

1719
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:54,177
Tell her Jai.
- He's absolutely right..

1720
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:56,084
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

1721
01:41:56,143 --> 01:41:58,282
Just leave.
- Jlo, at least listen to us. Please.

1722
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:01,383
Jai. Better get lost.

1723
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:06,362
Or else you will get hit so
badly that you wont be able

1724
01:42:06,453 --> 01:42:10,265
Jolly. - If you weren't in
this condition then I...I..

1725
01:42:10,324 --> 01:42:11,530
You know what I had done.

1726
01:42:11,592 --> 01:42:13,629
I would've picked him up like this..

1727
01:42:13,727 --> 01:42:15,434
..And dropped you like this.

1728
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:16,600
And then..

1729
01:42:16,663 --> 01:42:20,736
Rascal, you're fortunate
that you can't stand up.

1730
01:42:21,001 --> 01:42:23,072
Otherwise I would've
made cream-pie out of you.

1731
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,514
And then I would've
smashed you like this.

1732
01:42:24,705 --> 01:42:27,311
Like this, this, this.
- Jolly.

1733
01:42:27,374 --> 01:42:29,376
Don't do it. Don't do it.

1734
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:32,322
Hey you, you don't know who I am.

1735
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:35,651
Rascal. Why you..

1736
01:42:35,716 --> 01:42:37,491
You don't know who I am.

1737
01:42:42,022 --> 01:42:44,298
Oh no.

1738
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:46,400
Scoundrel. Why didn't
you tell me earlier?

1739
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:49,407
I was telling you "Don't
hit him, don't hit him".

1740
01:42:49,463 --> 01:42:51,136
Couldn't you say it in Hindi?

1741
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:52,802
Didn't you speak in Marathi
when you were scared? - Yes.

1742
01:42:53,066 --> 01:42:54,443
I spoke in Sindhi when I was scared.

1743
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:55,639
What?

1744
01:42:56,103 --> 01:42:57,275
Sosa.

1745
01:42:58,138 --> 01:42:59,378
Why the wheelchair?

1746
01:42:59,773 --> 01:43:02,185
Why walk, when you can ride?

1747
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:04,149
My name is Sosa.

1748
01:43:04,378 --> 01:43:08,383
And I have appointed these
bodyguards for moments like these.

1749
01:43:08,782 --> 01:43:11,058
Come on, baby.

1750
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:13,394
Sorry, sorry. Sosa.

1751
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:14,830
Wait, wait.

1752
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:39,657
Now pick up that table,
and smash it on them.

1753
01:44:03,437 --> 01:44:04,780
You, you, you.

1754
01:44:04,871 --> 01:44:06,350
Kill him.

1755
01:44:54,321 --> 01:44:55,732
Now who is he?

1756
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:58,360
Why are they making
an entry one by one?

1757
01:44:58,425 --> 01:45:01,201
Relax. I will take care of them.

1758
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:42,473
What now?

1759
01:45:42,869 --> 01:45:49,286
Those who are blessed by
God can do impossible things.

1760
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:50,647
Kill him.

1761
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:08,437
Jlo. Look.

1762
01:46:08,495 --> 01:46:10,805
We brought two fake
Jolly’s to avenge Jai's father.

1763
01:46:11,798 --> 01:46:14,369
Everything was a lie.
Let me explain you.

1764
01:46:17,237 --> 01:46:18,511
They are their girlfriends. Not mine.

1765
01:46:18,572 --> 01:46:19,744
I love you.

1766
01:46:58,712 --> 01:47:01,591
Are you fine?
- Yes, Jlo. I love you.

1767
01:47:01,648 --> 01:47:02,888
But I am still angry with you.

1768
01:47:02,949 --> 01:47:04,622
And I can forgive you
on only one condition.

1769
01:47:04,684 --> 01:47:06,027
I accept all your conditions.

1770
01:47:06,286 --> 01:47:07,697
I accept. I accept. I accept.
- What are you saying?

1771
01:47:07,754 --> 01:47:08,858
First ask her the condition.
- Yes.

1772
01:47:08,922 --> 01:47:10,959
It can't be bigger than the
problem we're currently in.

1773
01:47:11,024 --> 01:47:12,435
I accept. Done.

1774
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:14,900
Fine. Then take me to your house.
- What?

1775
01:47:14,961 --> 01:47:16,065
What?
- What?

1776
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:17,501
What?

1777
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:19,475
Jolly, this is my condition now.

1778
01:47:19,533 --> 01:47:21,376
I don't want to take any risk now.

1779
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:23,381
I am going with you, to your home.

1780
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:25,572
And I will stay with you 2417.

1781
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:27,482
I can say any lie you want me to.

1782
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:29,612
But I am coming with
you to your house.

1783
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:42,660
Your driver got engaged.

1784
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:45,565
Is this a true story or a new story?

1785
01:47:45,892 --> 01:47:47,735
This is a love story.

1786
01:47:48,662 --> 01:47:49,936
We just need your blessings.

1787
01:47:51,531 --> 01:47:54,978
Now you want him to
bless drivers as well?

1788
01:47:55,035 --> 01:47:56,412
Why?
- Why?

1789
01:47:56,603 --> 01:47:57,877
What's wrong with drivers?

1790
01:47:58,071 --> 01:47:59,607
Don't they have a heart?

1791
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:03,716
I am devotee of Bhadrakaali.

1792
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:05,453
I've learnt only one thing.

1793
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:09,926
I will bless them.

1794
01:48:11,084 --> 01:48:13,826
Then you'll allow us to stay
here for a few days too, right?

1795
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:15,464
It's a wedding
atmosphere in the house.

1796
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:17,426
More the merrier.

1797
01:48:18,792 --> 01:48:19,896
Fine.

1798
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:22,565
But, hold. I will
give my blessings too.

1799
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:23,869
But in a traditional style.

1800
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:25,068
Yes.
- Hold.

1801
01:48:26,566 --> 01:48:27,909
Come, take his blessings.

1802
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:35,678
Bless you.
- Yes.

1803
01:48:36,576 --> 01:48:37,953
Come on.

1804
01:48:42,482 --> 01:48:43,790
God bless. God bless. God bless.

1805
01:48:44,618 --> 01:48:45,961
Where did he go?
- He left.

1806
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:47,999
He...he...left. Yes.

1807
01:48:48,655 --> 01:48:49,793
That's okay.

1808
01:48:51,791 --> 01:48:52,929
Take his blessings.

1809
01:48:57,631 --> 01:48:59,577
May you prosper. Like me.

1810
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:03,006
Next year... may you
be blessed with a child.

1811
01:49:06,106 --> 01:49:08,643
Come, let me show you
the baby making room.

1812
01:49:11,578 --> 01:49:13,683
What a hell?

1813
01:49:14,714 --> 01:49:17,024
What the hell is
happening in this house?

1814
01:49:17,617 --> 01:49:19,961
I can't understand.

1815
01:49:20,654 --> 01:49:22,190
What kind of a father-in-law is he?

1816
01:49:22,455 --> 01:49:24,935
He's blessing his own son-in-law...

1817
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:27,437
...to have a child from another woman.

1818
01:49:29,596 --> 01:49:32,099
This is as fishy as a
vegetarian eating fish.

1819
01:49:32,832 --> 01:49:35,540
Very fishy.

1820
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:37,910
Let me find out.

1821
01:49:37,971 --> 01:49:39,143
Right now.

1822
01:49:55,689 --> 01:49:57,464
"Do you want me?"

1823
01:49:57,624 --> 01:49:59,194
"Do you need me?"

1824
01:49:59,559 --> 01:50:01,129
"Wanna love me?"

1825
01:50:01,494 --> 01:50:03,098
"Come to me, baby."

1826
01:50:03,163 --> 01:50:06,975
"Right now."

1827
01:50:07,033 --> 01:50:10,879
"Right now."

1828
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:12,644
"Do you want me?"

1829
01:50:12,872 --> 01:50:14,579
"Do you need me?"

1830
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:16,516
"Wanna love me?"

1831
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:18,519
"Come to me, baby."

1832
01:50:18,578 --> 01:50:22,219
"Right now."

1833
01:50:22,482 --> 01:50:26,089
"Right now."

1834
01:50:26,553 --> 01:50:30,262
"I will spend my whole life with you."

1835
01:50:30,523 --> 01:50:34,164
"In any condition I will
spend my whole life with you."

1836
01:50:34,227 --> 01:50:37,606
"I can even lay down my life for you."

1837
01:50:37,664 --> 01:50:39,575
"Do you want me?"

1838
01:50:39,633 --> 01:50:41,112
"Do you need me?"

1839
01:50:41,534 --> 01:50:43,172
"Wanna love me?"

1840
01:50:43,236 --> 01:50:45,079
"Come to me, baby."

1841
01:50:45,138 --> 01:50:48,950
"Right now."

1842
01:50:49,009 --> 01:50:52,889
"Right now."

1843
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:12,241
"it's a beautiful moment."

1844
01:51:12,298 --> 01:51:14,209
"Here's the honey, and the moon too."

1845
01:51:14,267 --> 01:51:16,144
"You're my summer."

1846
01:51:16,202 --> 01:51:18,113
"You're my monsoon too."

1847
01:51:21,941 --> 01:51:25,753
"My intentions are to
blow out the lights."

1848
01:51:25,812 --> 01:51:29,589
"Fill my heart up with your love."

1849
01:51:31,017 --> 01:51:34,794
"Everywhere I looked I saw only you."

1850
01:51:34,888 --> 01:51:36,697
"Do you want me?"

1851
01:51:36,756 --> 01:51:38,599
"Do you need me?"

1852
01:51:38,658 --> 01:51:40,604
"Wanna love me?"

1853
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:42,230
"Come to me, baby."

1854
01:51:42,295 --> 01:51:45,606
"Right now."

1855
01:51:46,166 --> 01:51:50,012
"Right now."

1856
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:09,030
"Do you...want me?"

1857
01:52:09,656 --> 01:52:12,728
"Do you...need me?"

1858
01:52:13,259 --> 01:52:15,239
"The mood's romantic."

1859
01:52:15,295 --> 01:52:17,206
"And you're with me."

1860
01:52:17,263 --> 01:52:19,072
"The heart's mischievous."

1861
01:52:19,132 --> 01:52:21,043
"The ambiance is young."

1862
01:52:24,904 --> 01:52:28,681
"Your pranks makes
my heart beat faster."

1863
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:32,349
"Makes my entire body shiver."

1864
01:52:34,147 --> 01:52:37,720
"Let me hide you in my arms."

1865
01:52:37,784 --> 01:52:39,388
"Do you want me?"

1866
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:41,255
"Do you need me?"

1867
01:52:41,654 --> 01:52:43,327
"Wanna love me?"

1868
01:52:43,389 --> 01:52:45,198
"Come to me, baby."

1869
01:52:45,258 --> 01:52:49,104
"Right now."

1870
01:52:49,162 --> 01:52:52,974
"Right now."

1871
01:52:53,299 --> 01:52:57,145
"I will spend my whole life with you."

1872
01:52:57,203 --> 01:53:01,049
"In any condition I will
spend my whole life with you."

1873
01:53:01,107 --> 01:53:04,316
"I can even lay down my life for you."

1874
01:53:04,377 --> 01:53:06,288
"Do you want me?"

1875
01:53:06,346 --> 01:53:08,257
"Do you need me?"

1876
01:53:08,314 --> 01:53:10,021
"Wanna love me?"

1877
01:53:10,216 --> 01:53:11,889
"Come to me, baby."

1878
01:53:11,985 --> 01:53:15,831
"Right now."

1879
01:53:15,889 --> 01:53:19,701
"Right now."

1880
01:53:23,396 --> 01:53:27,173
"Right now."

1881
01:53:31,104 --> 01:53:34,847
"Right now."

1882
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:37,849
Good morning.

1883
01:53:38,878 --> 01:53:40,016
Good morning.

1884
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:44,189
Good morning, JD sir.

1885
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:46,153
Terrific house.

1886
01:53:47,086 --> 01:53:50,693
I listened to you and turned
my house into a guesthouse.

1887
01:53:50,757 --> 01:53:52,930
I feel like slapping
you below your ear...

1888
01:53:53,026 --> 01:53:54,903
No, no. not below the
ear but Behind his ear.

1889
01:53:56,095 --> 01:53:59,941
There's soap left behind Badal's ear.

1890
01:54:00,033 --> 01:54:01,171
Clean it please.

1891
01:54:11,311 --> 01:54:12,449
Hello.

1892
01:54:12,779 --> 01:54:14,725
My Jaggu's so nice.

1893
01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:16,727
He sat down for a bath.

1894
01:54:16,783 --> 01:54:18,729
The stool slipped from underneath him.

1895
01:54:18,785 --> 01:54:20,924
Jaggu started laughing.

1896
01:54:21,855 --> 01:54:23,732
My Batook's so nice.

1897
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:25,201
He sat down for a bath.

1898
01:54:25,258 --> 01:54:26,896
The stool slipped
from underneath him...

1899
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:28,064
Batuk started laughing.

1900
01:54:29,762 --> 01:54:34,734
You haven't forgotten
our childhood shenanigans.

1901
01:54:35,301 --> 01:54:36,974
Hail Sri Krishna.

1902
01:54:37,070 --> 01:54:40,074
Your friendship
doesn't let me, Batook.

1903
01:54:40,273 --> 01:54:41,843
Hail Bhadrakaali.

1904
01:54:42,208 --> 01:54:44,313
Then you wouldn't
have forgotten that...

1905
01:54:44,377 --> 01:54:48,120
...we promised each other that
we will get our children married.

1906
01:54:51,017 --> 01:54:52,291
Yes, I...

1907
01:54:53,019 --> 01:54:54,362
Actually, nowadays...

1908
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:56,366
No, no, not now but tomorrow.

1909
01:54:56,422 --> 01:54:58,368
Your SP friend will take his jeep...

1910
01:54:58,424 --> 01:55:01,337
No, no, catch a
plane and come to London.

1911
01:55:01,794 --> 01:55:03,273
I am bringing my
daughter along as well.

1912
01:55:03,329 --> 01:55:04,831
On the first flight, okay.

1913
01:55:05,064 --> 01:55:07,442
Send your son to pick me up.

1914
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,377
I have never seen him.

1915
01:55:09,435 --> 01:55:14,111
But I will recognize him using
my years of police experience.

1916
01:55:14,173 --> 01:55:16,779
Then your son and my
daughter will be together.

1917
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:18,220
Goodbye.

1918
01:55:20,780 --> 01:55:21,884
Why you...

1919
01:55:21,948 --> 01:55:23,894
Trust me one last time
like you did before.

1920
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:25,896
I will take care of
these temporary relatives.

1921
01:55:25,952 --> 01:55:27,260
And the permanent
one that's arriving...

1922
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:29,300
...will be received by your son.

1923
01:55:30,189 --> 01:55:31,293
How will you do that?

1924
01:55:32,792 --> 01:55:33,930
Hail Bhadrakaali.

1925
01:55:36,529 --> 01:55:38,975
Come on, Parul, walk faster.

1926
01:55:53,980 --> 01:55:55,926
I am Batuk Patel.

1927
01:55:56,182 --> 01:55:57,559
You're Jolly, right?

1928
01:55:58,418 --> 01:56:01,331
Yes...yes...
- No. He's Jolly sir.

1929
01:56:02,488 --> 01:56:03,933
Then who are you?
- What?

1930
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:05,469
He's your driver.

1931
01:56:05,925 --> 01:56:07,461
Maaro' driver.
- 'Maaro' driver?

1932
01:56:07,593 --> 01:56:09,197
I haven't done anything. Don't hit me.

1933
01:56:09,262 --> 01:56:12,539
In Gujarati 'my
driver' means 'Maaro driver'.

1934
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:15,943
And she's my daughter Parul.

1935
01:56:16,903 --> 01:56:18,246
Isn't your name Jai?

1936
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,442
Yes.
- No.

1937
01:56:19,505 --> 01:56:21,451
What's yes, no.
- Of course.

1938
01:56:21,507 --> 01:56:23,180
Jai's a short form.

1939
01:56:23,242 --> 01:56:25,222
Jai for... Jai for Jolly.

1940
01:56:25,278 --> 01:56:27,019
Yes. Jai for Jolly

1941
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:29,456
Do you know him?
- Yes.

1942
01:56:30,149 --> 01:56:32,390
Very good. That's great.

1943
01:56:34,587 --> 01:56:36,032
Driver.
- Yes.

1944
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:37,627
Take the luggage.
- Yes.

1945
01:56:38,624 --> 01:56:39,967
Sorry.

1946
01:56:40,026 --> 01:56:42,131
Please come, come, come.

1947
01:56:42,228 --> 01:56:44,139
You need to keep him in control.

1948
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:45,873
Now I get it.

1949
01:56:46,032 --> 01:56:50,003
You said that your daddy has
selected someone else for you.

1950
01:56:50,069 --> 01:56:51,946
And you would want to marry her only.

1951
01:56:52,205 --> 01:56:55,015
All this time you knew
that the girl was me.

1952
01:56:55,875 --> 01:56:57,411
What a surprise, Jai.

1953
01:56:57,477 --> 01:56:59,218
I mean Jolly.
- Yes.

1954
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,289
Really, what a surprise.

1955
01:57:02,448 --> 01:57:05,520
Come on, I want to see your house.
- Me too.

1956
01:57:06,452 --> 01:57:08,261
"Papa plays the band."

1957
01:57:10,456 --> 01:57:12,094
"Papa plays the band."

1958
01:57:14,093 --> 01:57:15,629
"Papa plays the band."

1959
01:57:16,262 --> 01:57:19,300
I am so happy to see you, so happy.

1960
01:57:19,365 --> 01:57:20,605
I am so happy.

1961
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:25,244
Why do you look worried?
- No, no, not worried...

1962
01:57:25,304 --> 01:57:26,442
I mean...

1963
01:57:26,606 --> 01:57:28,916
I get it. I get it.

1964
01:57:28,975 --> 01:57:30,113
You are thinking...

1965
01:57:30,176 --> 01:57:31,917
...when this friendship will
turn into us becoming in-laws.

1966
01:57:32,178 --> 01:57:33,521
Right? Right?

1967
01:57:33,646 --> 01:57:36,183
Don't worry. Consider it done.

1968
01:57:36,315 --> 01:57:40,491
Jolly and Parul
already know each other.

1969
01:57:48,494 --> 01:57:50,371
Who is standing besides Jolly?

1970
01:57:51,531 --> 01:57:53,101
That's my driver?

1971
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:55,101
Driver, did you eat?

1972
01:57:58,137 --> 01:58:01,209
You'll keep my family and me
locked in the room for two days?

1973
01:58:01,307 --> 01:58:02,513
Like I said.

1974
01:58:02,675 --> 01:58:04,450
Our astrologer has said...

1975
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:06,421
...if you keep the family
locked up for two days...

1976
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:09,289
...it makes the family grow fonder.
- I won't follow this

1977
01:58:09,348 --> 01:58:10,520
Can't say about the rites...

1978
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:12,722
...but you will have
to follow this ritual.

1979
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:15,326
He's outside.

1980
01:58:15,388 --> 01:58:18,267
What are you doing outside?
- He's... JD. JD.

1981
01:58:18,558 --> 01:58:21,095
We're in-laws now.

1982
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,298
In-laws?

1983
01:58:22,728 --> 01:58:24,139
But we are his in-laws.

1984
01:58:24,197 --> 01:58:25,403
You heard it wrong.

1985
01:58:25,465 --> 01:58:28,071
He's saying that they are friends.

1986
01:58:28,134 --> 01:58:29,511
Who are the background artists?

1987
01:58:32,672 --> 01:58:35,346
They...are family friends.

1988
01:58:35,408 --> 01:58:36,614
Distant relative.

1989
01:58:36,676 --> 01:58:39,020
That's why they are
standing to far away.

1990
01:58:41,114 --> 01:58:43,060
Let me show you your room.

1991
01:58:43,116 --> 01:58:44,322
Let's go. Let's go.

1992
01:58:44,383 --> 01:58:46,989
Let them see their room, and
I will show you the bathroom

1993
01:58:52,058 --> 01:58:54,004
There's a fire burning here, JD.

1994
01:58:54,427 --> 01:58:58,239
But since I met you
my heart is at peace.

1995
01:58:58,998 --> 01:59:00,773
But why are you so worried?

1996
01:59:01,367 --> 01:59:03,176
No, I...

1997
01:59:03,569 --> 01:59:04,707


1998
01:59:06,105 --> 01:59:07,641
...Be careful of your tongue, JD.

1999
01:59:08,207 --> 01:59:10,187
It's worth a lot.

2000
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:13,791
Your entire life
changed because of that.

2001
01:59:14,147 --> 01:59:17,720
Now your son's getting
married also because of your word.

2002
01:59:19,285 --> 01:59:23,563
And you raised your son so well.

2003
01:59:23,756 --> 01:59:25,133
I must admit.

2004
01:59:25,458 --> 01:59:28,769
Because these days the boys
in London are very advanced.

2005
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:31,765
They bring their bride home...

2006
01:59:32,031 --> 01:59:33,669
...without the
consent of their parents.

2007
01:59:36,669 --> 01:59:38,080
Listen to me.

2008
01:59:38,304 --> 01:59:40,215
Five days later it's
the 15th of August.

2009
01:59:41,107 --> 01:59:42,450
Lets fix Jolly's marriage.

2010
01:59:50,783 --> 01:59:56,461
Fine, Jolly's marriage is
fixed FOR the 15th of august

2011
01:59:57,056 --> 01:59:58,228
Yes.

2012
01:59:58,491 --> 02:00:01,529
Marriage is fixed the 15th. Yes.

2013
02:00:02,595 --> 02:00:03,733
Yes.

2014
02:00:04,330 --> 02:00:05,809
For Chintu Sunny is Jolly.

2015
02:00:06,265 --> 02:00:07,676
For Daboo Max is Jolly.

2016
02:00:07,733 --> 02:00:09,508
For Batuk Jai is Jolly.

2017
02:00:09,569 --> 02:00:11,571
And for JD Jolly is Jolly.

2018
02:00:12,071 --> 02:00:15,177
According to Chintu, Sunny with
sit with his daughter

2019
02:00:15,241 --> 02:00:16,413
...in the marriage dais.

2020
02:00:16,475 --> 02:00:18,819
But according to JD,
it's going to be Jolly.

2021
02:00:19,212 --> 02:00:21,488
According to Daboo Max will
sit with his daughter Bobby.

2022
02:00:21,547 --> 02:00:23,356
...In the marriage dais.

2023
02:00:23,449 --> 02:00:26,430
And according to Batook Jolly
will sit with his daughter..

2024
02:00:26,485 --> 02:00:28,328
...In the marriage dais.

2025
02:00:28,421 --> 02:00:31,129
But Jolly wants to marry Jlo.

2026
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:33,170
Why are you trying yourself?
Why are you trying yourself?

2027
02:00:33,226 --> 02:00:34,569
You've tired us.

2028
02:00:34,627 --> 02:00:36,573
You've caused this entire confusion.

2029
02:00:36,796 --> 02:00:40,243
Can't say about Brad but
we're in this pit because of you.

2030
02:00:40,299 --> 02:00:42,506
Because me. Because me.

2031
02:00:42,568 --> 02:00:44,275
Fight with this problem.

2032
02:00:44,337 --> 02:00:45,475
Why are you fighting
amongst yourselves?

2033
02:00:45,671 --> 02:00:47,412
You've finally become
friends after such a long time.

2034
02:00:47,607 --> 02:00:48,711
Just a minute.

2035
02:00:48,841 --> 02:00:53,517
If we turn JD and
Batuk against each other...

2036
02:00:53,879 --> 02:00:56,155
...then a lot of our
problems can be solved.

2037
02:00:56,215 --> 02:00:57,319
But how is that possible?

2038
02:00:57,383 --> 02:00:58,760
They both are best of friends.
- Yes.

2039
02:00:58,818 --> 02:01:00,229
What were we?
- Friends.

2040
02:01:00,286 --> 02:01:01,458
We were friends as well.

2041
02:01:01,754 --> 02:01:03,461
But we turned
enemies because of a girl.

2042
02:01:03,623 --> 02:01:07,469
If we can get a beautiful girl...

2043
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:10,564
...between those two old
HAGS then just watch the fun.

2044
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:13,270
Hey, you want to bring a girl
between my father and his friend?

2045
02:01:13,332 --> 02:01:15,175
Are you crazy? This is right.

2046
02:01:15,234 --> 02:01:16,508
And anyway, they both are widowers.

2047
02:01:16,569 --> 02:01:17,912
Why you... who are
you calling a widower?

2048
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:20,582
So what?
- What do you want to say?

2049
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:23,314
You want to get a girl
between these two old men.

2050
02:01:23,376 --> 02:01:26,789
Not a girl, but a beauty.

2051
02:01:26,846 --> 02:01:32,888
She always nails her target,
her name is Anarkali.

2052
02:01:35,888 --> 02:01:42,567
I even forgot my chandelier for you

2053
02:01:42,628 --> 02:01:44,335
Batuk sir has
organized a small party."

2054
02:01:44,563 --> 02:01:45,701
Here?

2055
02:01:45,765 --> 02:01:54,378
I even forgot my earrings for you

2056
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:56,511
Lets go down for a while. Or
else Batuk uncle will feel bad.

2057
02:01:56,575 --> 02:02:06,360
Let's go. "I forgot everything,
just for you."

2058
02:02:06,619 --> 02:02:09,532
"Just for you."

2059
02:02:09,622 --> 02:02:11,863
"Just for you."

2060
02:02:11,924 --> 02:02:13,926
"So what happened?"

2061
02:02:14,193 --> 02:02:19,404
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

2062
02:02:23,836 --> 02:02:28,444
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

2063
02:02:28,541 --> 02:02:31,681
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2064
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:40,461
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

2065
02:02:40,553 --> 02:02:43,659
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2066
02:02:45,324 --> 02:02:49,898
"You made me restless."

2067
02:02:49,995 --> 02:02:52,737
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2068
02:02:52,798 --> 02:02:54,971
"There she goes."

2069
02:02:55,234 --> 02:02:57,840
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2070
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:09,725
"Rock the night."

2071
02:03:09,782 --> 02:03:11,659
"Burn the floor." "Hold me tight."

2072
02:03:11,717 --> 02:03:14,698
"Anarkali, rock the floor tonight."

2073
02:03:18,591 --> 02:03:27,875
"A tormentor had me
pinned in the wall."

2074
02:03:28,033 --> 02:03:37,681
"He tried to imprison my heart."

2075
02:03:37,743 --> 02:03:39,916
"I love freedom."

2076
02:03:40,279 --> 02:03:42,452
"I don't want to stay
imprisoned any more."

2077
02:03:42,615 --> 02:03:46,859
"I won't endure his torments any more."

2078
02:03:47,386 --> 02:03:49,696
"Teach me the hip-hop."

2079
02:03:49,755 --> 02:03:51,894
"Top the beat."

2080
02:03:52,024 --> 02:03:54,470
"Play some trance."

2081
02:03:54,527 --> 02:03:56,803
"Give me a chance."

2082
02:03:57,363 --> 02:03:59,741
"Let me sway."

2083
02:03:59,799 --> 02:04:02,040
"Let me sway."

2084
02:04:02,301 --> 02:04:07,546
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

2085
02:04:12,011 --> 02:04:16,551
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

2086
02:04:16,649 --> 02:04:19,653
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2087
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:26,062
"You made me restless."

2088
02:04:26,325 --> 02:04:28,862
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2089
02:04:28,928 --> 02:04:31,408
"There she goes."

2090
02:04:31,464 --> 02:04:33,466
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2091
02:04:33,532 --> 02:04:36,479
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2092
02:04:43,409 --> 02:04:45,685
"Hit it. Hit it. Hit it."

2093
02:05:04,096 --> 02:05:13,540
"Our
love-story...will be really famous."

2094
02:05:13,839 --> 02:05:23,055
"Your beauty...killed me."

2095
02:05:23,115 --> 02:05:24,958
Our plan is a hit.

2096
02:05:25,017 --> 02:05:27,122
Our plan is a hit.

2097
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,864
"Give me some attention."

2098
02:05:29,922 --> 02:05:32,163
"Get rid of my tension."

2099
02:05:32,424 --> 02:05:34,734
"Your body's like fire."

2100
02:05:34,793 --> 02:05:37,069
"Your touch is electrifying."

2101
02:05:37,129 --> 02:05:39,541
"You're like a bombshell."

2102
02:05:39,598 --> 02:05:41,874
"My heart's burning too."

2103
02:05:41,934 --> 02:05:44,414
"Soothe my heart."

2104
02:05:44,470 --> 02:05:46,677
"Make this beautiful mistake."

2105
02:05:46,772 --> 02:05:51,846
"You're the cure for every pain."

2106
02:05:51,977 --> 02:05:57,051
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

2107
02:06:01,854 --> 02:06:06,428
"Leaving my Salim's alley."

2108
02:06:06,492 --> 02:06:09,564
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2109
02:06:11,163 --> 02:06:15,908
"You made me restless."

2110
02:06:15,968 --> 02:06:18,676
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2111
02:06:18,771 --> 02:06:21,012
"There she goes."

2112
02:06:21,073 --> 02:06:23,610
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2113
02:06:23,676 --> 02:06:25,781
"There she goes."

2114
02:06:32,751 --> 02:06:37,029
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2115
02:06:39,858 --> 02:06:41,963
"Anarkali's of to the disco."

2116
02:06:42,027 --> 02:06:43,973
Stand quietly.

2117
02:06:46,665 --> 02:06:48,110
She was with me last night.

2118
02:06:48,167 --> 02:06:49,874
She was asking about you.

2119
02:06:52,137 --> 02:06:53,980
She wants to meet you, sir.

2120
02:06:55,541 --> 02:06:57,543
If you say such nonsense...

2121
02:06:57,943 --> 02:06:59,251
...then I will slap you.

2122
02:06:59,845 --> 02:07:02,621
I will meet her. Never.

2123
02:07:03,015 --> 02:07:04,585
Then she'll come see you.

2124
02:07:04,650 --> 02:07:05,890
Stop blabbering your nonsense.

2125
02:07:05,951 --> 02:07:08,989
That's what she was saying, not me.

2126
02:07:10,723 --> 02:07:15,729
Fine, I will tell Sarla that
you don't want to meet her.

2127
02:07:16,061 --> 02:07:20,737
Who...who is Sarla?

2128
02:07:20,899 --> 02:07:23,004
She calls herself Anarkali
for this ruthless world.

2129
02:07:23,636 --> 02:07:25,206
Here real name is Sarla.

2130
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:30,849
But Sarla was Jolly's mother's name.
- No.

2131
02:07:31,176 --> 02:07:32,621
Jolly's mother?
- Yes.

2132
02:07:32,678 --> 02:07:33,850
Sana?
- Yes.

2133
02:07:36,682 --> 02:07:37,956
You must meet her now.

2134
02:07:38,584 --> 02:07:40,257
Please meet her. I insist.

2135
02:07:47,259 --> 02:07:49,739
Anarkali. Was asking about me.
- Yes.

2136
02:07:49,795 --> 02:07:51,832
What are you saying?
- Yes. She was asking about me?

2137
02:07:52,131 --> 02:07:53,872
Give me her phone number.
- Right away.

2138
02:07:53,932 --> 02:07:55,172
I will give you her phone number.

2139
02:07:56,168 --> 02:07:57,306
Let it be.
- Why?

2140
02:07:57,569 --> 02:07:59,048
Doesn't seem nice.
- Why?

2141
02:07:59,104 --> 02:08:01,050
I am here for my daughter's marriage.

2142
02:08:01,106 --> 02:08:02,847
How will it look?

2143
02:08:03,175 --> 02:08:04,586
Are you...are you sure?

2144
02:08:05,177 --> 02:08:08,090
Fine, then I will tell Hetal.

2145
02:08:08,881 --> 02:08:10,019
Hetal?

2146
02:08:10,282 --> 02:08:12,159
Who is Hetal?
- Anarkali.

2147
02:08:12,618 --> 02:08:14,291
She calls herself Anarkali
for this ruthless world.

2148
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:16,863
Her real name Hetal
is on the passport.

2149
02:08:18,123 --> 02:08:19,261
Why? What's wrong?

2150
02:08:20,726 --> 02:08:24,674
Parul's late mother's
name was Hetal as well.

2151
02:08:26,565 --> 02:08:27,703
What?

2152
02:08:27,766 --> 02:08:28,938
What a coincidence.

2153
02:08:29,668 --> 02:08:33,081
Then big brother you
must meet Hetal once.

2154
02:08:34,106 --> 02:08:37,679
Hetal. Hetal.

2155
02:08:38,711 --> 02:08:39,883
Hetal. Hetal.

2156
02:08:46,852 --> 02:08:49,059
JD sir! You! Here!

2157
02:08:53,058 --> 02:08:55,334
I love fools.
- What?

2158
02:08:55,961 --> 02:08:58,134
Come, sit. Sit. Come.

2159
02:09:02,768 --> 02:09:04,873
Oh, God!

2160
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:10,982
You...wanted to meet me. Why?

2161
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:13,913
Even I don't have an
answer to that question.

2162
02:09:14,313 --> 02:09:19,058
But yes, I did want to meet you once.

2163
02:09:20,385 --> 02:09:24,231
You dance... I mean
you sing very well.

2164
02:09:24,289 --> 02:09:25,632
Stupid.

2165
02:09:26,158 --> 02:09:27,933
You too, JD sir.

2166
02:09:29,862 --> 02:09:31,239
J... JD.

2167
02:09:31,930 --> 02:09:34,877
Though a little, but
you danced really well.

2168
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,877
I can't dance.

2169
02:09:37,069 --> 02:09:40,312
Last night the boys
gave me a few drinks..

2170
02:09:40,739 --> 02:09:43,185
..So my legs started
swaying to the beats, Hetal.

2171
02:09:43,742 --> 02:09:46,689
Sorry. Anarkali.

2172
02:09:47,045 --> 02:09:48,820
Oh Batook.

2173
02:09:49,681 --> 02:09:53,254
It sounds so nice when you say Hetal.

2174
02:09:54,920 --> 02:09:58,925
Just once, for my sake,
call my real name.

2175
02:09:58,991 --> 02:10:00,129
Sarla.

2176
02:10:02,261 --> 02:10:06,175
It sounds so nice to
hear you say Sarla.

2177
02:10:06,932 --> 02:10:08,104
Wow.

2178
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:09,903
You are so nice.

2179
02:10:10,169 --> 02:10:14,413
I wonder why people try
to demean wealthy people.

2180
02:10:15,707 --> 02:10:17,880
Who? Who are you talking about?

2181
02:10:17,943 --> 02:10:19,047
No, no.

2182
02:10:19,111 --> 02:10:21,955
Actually your friend
Batook really likes you.

2183
02:10:22,214 --> 02:10:25,923
But when I said that I want to
meet you he straightaway ref

2184
02:10:26,418 --> 02:10:28,955
He said that if I meet you..

2185
02:10:29,054 --> 02:10:33,867
..Then my image and
reputation will be ruined.

2186
02:10:34,059 --> 02:10:39,441
Because...there's a
shameful past connected with you.

2187
02:10:39,898 --> 02:10:42,708
Shameful past? Mine?

2188
02:10:42,835 --> 02:10:47,807
Batook was saying
that you were a dacoit.

2189
02:10:48,407 --> 02:10:52,753
And you were lying that
you were a feared dacoit.

2190
02:10:52,978 --> 02:10:56,050
JD was saying that
you spread a rumor..

2191
02:10:56,114 --> 02:10:58,924
..That you are a
retired police commissioner.

2192
02:10:58,984 --> 02:11:01,931
He was saying that you were a coward.

2193
02:11:01,987 --> 02:11:04,297
That you were just a
low-down constable.

2194
02:11:04,356 --> 02:11:07,360
He's never even killed a rat.

2195
02:11:07,426 --> 02:11:10,407
You would steal loose
change from blind beggars.

2196
02:11:10,562 --> 02:11:12,041
Jagga!

2197
02:11:12,097 --> 02:11:13,508
Batook!

2198
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:20,951
Today you've lost
respect in my eyes, Jagga.

2199
02:11:21,106 --> 02:11:23,518
You have.

2200
02:11:23,876 --> 02:11:29,383
We all know who has lost respect?

2201
02:11:29,748 --> 02:11:32,752
Today you proved one thing, JD.

2202
02:11:32,985 --> 02:11:36,057
You can't change a
person if you change his name.

2203
02:11:36,121 --> 02:11:37,794
You're the one who has changed.

2204
02:11:38,156 --> 02:11:41,296
I feel disgusted to
call you my friend.

2205
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:46,332
You broke all old
relations to make a new one.

2206
02:11:46,398 --> 02:11:51,313
So today I reject your
son's proposal. - Papa.

2207
02:11:51,370 --> 02:11:53,145
Who are you to reject it?

2208
02:11:53,839 --> 02:11:57,184
I reject your daughter's proposal.

2209
02:11:58,243 --> 02:11:59,415
Jolly.

2210
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:10,931
Jolly. You won't marry Parul..

2211
02:12:11,523 --> 02:12:14,129
..But your original choice Henna.

2212
02:12:15,060 --> 02:12:16,266
Are you happy?

2213
02:12:19,164 --> 02:12:21,474
Let it be.

2214
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:26,849
I will get my daughter Parul
married in a respected family.

2215
02:12:26,972 --> 02:12:31,580
Parul. I will go get
my luggage right now.

2216
02:12:36,114 --> 02:12:38,390
I cannot live with you, Jai.

2217
02:12:39,117 --> 02:12:40,357
I can't live without you.

2218
02:12:40,419 --> 02:12:42,490
Even I can't live without you, dear.

2219
02:12:42,587 --> 02:12:44,965
But these two..
- Try to understand, sir.

2220
02:12:46,091 --> 02:12:47,399
The father's good for nothing.

2221
02:12:47,459 --> 02:12:48,938
And so is the daughter.

2222
02:12:49,828 --> 02:12:51,239
She's flirting around with the driver.

2223
02:12:53,899 --> 02:12:57,073
Batook's daughter is having
an affair with the driver.

2224
02:12:57,269 --> 02:12:59,840
And he was looking for
a respectable family.

2225
02:12:59,905 --> 02:13:01,145
Give them your blessings.

2226
02:13:01,540 --> 02:13:03,349
And you will get your revenge.

2227
02:13:03,408 --> 02:13:06,218
Think, do, take your revenge.

2228
02:13:06,411 --> 02:13:09,119
On the 15th august..
- Listen here. it's for you.

2229
02:13:09,281 --> 02:13:11,192
These two will get married as well.

2230
02:13:13,852 --> 02:13:14,990
Thank you, uncle.

2231
02:13:17,923 --> 02:13:19,197
What are you doing there?

2232
02:13:19,391 --> 02:13:20,529
Come on.

2233
02:13:20,625 --> 02:13:22,536
Come on.

2234
02:13:31,036 --> 02:13:32,310
Good day.

2235
02:13:32,371 --> 02:13:34,112
Move aside.

2236
02:13:34,406 --> 02:13:36,249
Congratulations.

2237
02:13:36,641 --> 02:13:38,018
15th august.

2238
02:13:38,543 --> 02:13:42,252
Prepare for Jolly's marriage.

2239
02:13:54,993 --> 02:13:56,495
Jolly.
- Yes!

2240
02:13:58,263 --> 02:13:59,401
Yes!

2241
02:14:01,066 --> 02:14:02,238
Come.

2242
02:14:02,667 --> 02:14:04,010
Come along.

2243
02:14:06,238 --> 02:14:07,410
Max.

2244
02:14:09,007 --> 02:14:14,218
Everyone's father knows
except for papa Ranjeet.

2245
02:14:27,459 --> 02:14:30,167
Ranjeet, I am confused.

2246
02:14:30,362 --> 02:14:32,035
Tell me your problem.

2247
02:14:32,097 --> 02:14:35,010
I love Derek. But I also love Andrew.

2248
02:14:35,267 --> 02:14:36,940
Who should I marry?

2249
02:14:39,071 --> 02:14:44,111
If you choose A,
you'll definitely miss B.

2250
02:14:44,976 --> 02:14:48,446
And if you choose B, then A.

2251
02:14:49,614 --> 02:14:54,063
I think you should go for C.

2252
02:14:54,519 --> 02:14:59,366
Because long time no see.
- I didn't get it.

2253
02:15:05,063 --> 02:15:06,667
Let me explain.

2254
02:15:07,299 --> 02:15:10,178
Flirt with me.

2255
02:15:10,602 --> 02:15:14,209
By the way, I am free after nine.

2256
02:15:14,372 --> 02:15:17,979
Place is yours...or mine?

2257
02:15:18,310 --> 02:15:19,482
I will sleep over it.

2258
02:15:20,979 --> 02:15:22,481
Sleep over me.

2259
02:15:23,215 --> 02:15:25,286
Excuse me.
- Squeeze me.

2260
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:26,488
Shut up.

2261
02:15:29,421 --> 02:15:30,525
Papa.

2262
02:15:38,096 --> 02:15:40,736
Come here.

2263
02:15:41,266 --> 02:15:44,042
Sunny. Hi, Max.

2264
02:15:44,102 --> 02:15:45,638
Max. how are you my boy, how are you?

2265
02:15:46,705 --> 02:15:48,207
Can't say about Twentieth century..

2266
02:15:48,273 --> 02:15:50,116
..But you're the real fox.

2267
02:15:50,175 --> 02:15:51,711
Fox. Fox.

2268
02:15:53,044 --> 02:15:57,186
Now return the fox's
watch that you just stole.

2269
02:15:57,249 --> 02:15:58,592
Wow.

2270
02:15:58,650 --> 02:16:00,652
No joking around with papa Ranjeet.

2271
02:16:00,719 --> 02:16:02,494
No joking around with papa Ranjeet.
- Sorry.

2272
02:16:02,554 --> 02:16:03,692
Sorry. Sorry.

2273
02:16:03,788 --> 02:16:06,564
Look, son. You're still a novice.

2274
02:16:06,791 --> 02:16:09,169
But, uncle. Sunny's just like you.

2275
02:16:10,595 --> 02:16:15,169
Max. he can't be like me
by just saying ayee aye.

2276
02:16:15,634 --> 02:16:19,605
And no dog can hunt only by barking.

2277
02:16:20,505 --> 02:16:21,643
You know.

2278
02:16:22,707 --> 02:16:27,349
He's hasn't laid his
hand on any girl yet.

2279
02:16:27,612 --> 02:16:29,353
What?
- I am ashamed of him.

2280
02:16:29,681 --> 02:16:31,217
What?
- Yes.

2281
02:16:31,283 --> 02:16:32,387
Sunny, is this true?

2282
02:16:32,450 --> 02:16:34,760
You're insulting me
in front of my friend.

2283
02:16:35,153 --> 02:16:37,497
I am the one who's feeling insulted.

2284
02:16:37,556 --> 02:16:40,059
Papa, you'll be proud of me tomorrow.

2285
02:16:40,392 --> 02:16:43,669
We'll be laying our hands on
the real deal tomorrow. - Yes.

2286
02:16:43,728 --> 02:16:46,607
We'll marry the girls and take
all their money and leave them.

2287
02:16:46,665 --> 02:16:50,374
Papa, that marriage dais
will be our ATM counter.

2288
02:16:50,435 --> 02:16:53,473
And the marriage
certificate will be our blank cheque.

2289
02:17:00,512 --> 02:17:04,790
I taught you swindling,
cheating, stealing.

2290
02:17:05,450 --> 02:17:09,262
But I never taught you
to break anyone's trust.

2291
02:17:11,690 --> 02:17:16,469
You two will marry those
girls and then leave them.

2292
02:17:17,128 --> 02:17:18,573
Break their trust.

2293
02:17:19,531 --> 02:17:20,703
Children.

2294
02:17:21,099 --> 02:17:23,204
Never break anyone's trust.

2295
02:17:25,503 --> 02:17:29,781
Son, many girls came and
went in papa Ranjeet's life.

2296
02:17:30,875 --> 02:17:35,585
But he married only the one he loved.

2297
02:17:36,748 --> 02:17:38,193
And that was your mother.

2298
02:17:38,383 --> 02:17:39,487
Understand.

2299
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:41,558
Think about it.

2300
02:17:46,524 --> 02:17:49,300
I heard that anyone falls in love.

2301
02:17:49,461 --> 02:17:52,237
I feel we've fallen in love too.

2302
02:17:52,731 --> 02:17:56,235
Max. Can't say about the rapist..

2303
02:17:56,601 --> 02:17:59,741
..But my father did
his job as a therapist.

2304
02:18:02,674 --> 02:18:03,812
Let's go.

2305
02:18:13,518 --> 02:18:14,656
Bloody cheaters.

2306
02:18:15,553 --> 02:18:17,396
You toyed with our feelings.

2307
02:18:18,757 --> 02:18:20,498
We never want to see your faces again.

2308
02:18:26,564 --> 02:18:30,410
Jai, you...love Parul.

2309
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:33,372
You want to marry her, don't you?

2310
02:18:34,205 --> 02:18:35,513
But son...

2311
02:18:38,276 --> 02:18:39,721
will you hurt Mr. Kapoor for that?

2312
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:42,852
Avenge my insult?

2313
02:18:44,215 --> 02:18:46,217
Is this what I taught you, son?

2314
02:18:46,484 --> 02:18:49,328
Papa is always right.

2315
02:18:50,288 --> 02:18:52,825
Who are they, son? - Papa,
they are my friends Sunny and Max.

2316
02:18:52,891 --> 02:18:55,337
Hello, uncle.
- Hello, son. - Hello.

2317
02:18:55,627 --> 02:18:57,538
How are you feeling now?
- Fine, son.

2318
02:18:57,595 --> 02:18:58,869
I thought that after your coma..

2319
02:18:58,963 --> 02:19:00,772
..Your life would come to a full stop.

2320
02:19:01,266 --> 02:19:02,404
Full stop?

2321
02:19:02,467 --> 02:19:03,571
Don't be so kind too him.

2322
02:19:03,635 --> 02:19:04,773
That enough.

2323
02:19:08,773 --> 02:19:10,753
Jai. Keep this money.

2324
02:19:11,376 --> 02:19:12,650
We cannot do your job now.

2325
02:19:12,711 --> 02:19:15,282
What?
- Uncle, we're leaving now.

2326
02:19:16,281 --> 02:19:17,624
Have you filled an organ donor card?

2327
02:19:17,682 --> 02:19:19,593
Come on. What are you..

2328
02:19:28,727 --> 02:19:30,263
We thought over it.

2329
02:19:31,329 --> 02:19:33,639
What you two did with us was wrong.

2330
02:19:35,266 --> 02:19:38,679
But you could've done worse.

2331
02:19:40,605 --> 02:19:42,243
And whatever you two did..

2332
02:19:43,274 --> 02:19:47,745
..At least it brought us close

2333
02:19:48,713 --> 02:19:50,750
And maybe tomorrow our daddies..

2334
02:19:50,815 --> 02:19:53,955
..Who are bitter enemies
can be come together again.

2335
02:19:55,320 --> 02:19:58,631
With that hope we're
here to say something.

2336
02:19:58,690 --> 02:19:59,862
Sunny.

2337
02:20:03,928 --> 02:20:06,272
Will you marry me?

2338
02:20:12,003 --> 02:20:14,540
Can't say about Daler..

2339
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:17,510
..But I have adorned your
name's Mehendi (henna)..

2340
02:20:21,946 --> 02:20:23,323
We will get married, won't we?

2341
02:20:23,481 --> 02:20:25,358
Are you crazy?

2342
02:20:25,517 --> 02:20:26,655
How will we get married?

2343
02:20:27,285 --> 02:20:28,889
Did you forget?
- He's right.

2344
02:20:28,953 --> 02:20:30,455
So many marriage daises.
So many Jolly’s.

2345
02:20:30,522 --> 02:20:31,728
And so many fathers.

2346
02:20:31,790 --> 02:20:33,360
"Why are you tiring yourself?

2347
02:20:33,425 --> 02:20:34,631
"Why are you tiring yourself"

2348
02:20:34,826 --> 02:20:36,897
My father's amongst them all.

2349
02:20:36,961 --> 02:20:39,498
The mother of all fathers.
Jaggu dacoit.

2350
02:20:40,565 --> 02:20:42,806
And tomorrow we're
all getting married.

2351
02:20:43,067 --> 02:20:44,444
Jagga.'

2352
02:20:54,045 --> 02:20:55,524
Welcome, welcome.

2353
02:20:56,781 --> 02:20:59,352
Foreigner Fafda. Duke of Wellington.

2354
02:20:59,984 --> 02:21:01,861
Hello congratulations

02:21:02,687 --> 02:21:04,064
Welcome, welcome.

2356
02:21:04,923 --> 02:21:07,699
Duke sir. I have drunk
a lot of your lemonade.

2357
02:21:07,759 --> 02:21:08,965
Top.

2358
02:21:10,695 --> 02:21:14,040
Shocking Sabudana. Prince Charles!
Prince Charles!

2359
02:21:14,866 --> 02:21:16,004
Welcome.

2360
02:21:16,434 --> 02:21:18,038
It's a very joyous, pleasure...

2361
02:21:18,703 --> 02:21:21,980
...to attend the UK man
of the Year son's wedding.

2362
02:21:22,407 --> 02:21:23,818
It's an honour, JD.

2363
02:21:24,075 --> 02:21:26,919
Sorry.
- Sir. The bride's father. Sir, sir.

2364
02:21:26,978 --> 02:21:29,015
Make yourself comfortable.
Make yourself comfortable.

2365
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:30,457
Take care.

2366
02:21:31,850 --> 02:21:32,988
Watch ahead.

2367
02:21:33,051 --> 02:21:34,496
There'll be bigger
personalities arriving.

2368
02:21:34,552 --> 02:21:36,725
Mamma mia. Pappa pia.

2369
02:21:36,788 --> 02:21:38,563
Normally climax
comes after the marriage.

2370
02:21:38,623 --> 02:21:40,967
But here the climax is
along with the marriage.

2371
02:21:41,025 --> 02:21:43,505
Flowers. Flowers. Shower it.

2372
02:21:43,561 --> 02:21:44,767
JD sir. JD sir.

2373
02:21:44,829 --> 02:21:47,969
You're very fortunate to
have got a chance to meet me.

2374
02:21:49,367 --> 02:21:50,778
I am joking.

2375
02:21:50,835 --> 02:21:54,612
Kapoor and company, where is
my commission? my commission

2376
02:21:54,772 --> 02:21:58,083
"Beauties, come and sing with me."

2377
02:21:58,142 --> 02:22:00,383
Excuse me, London's waiter.

2378
02:22:00,545 --> 02:22:02,388
Go get me a cold drink.

2379
02:22:02,914 --> 02:22:04,518
Hey horrendously dressed fool.

2380
02:22:04,782 --> 02:22:06,159
Who let you in?

2381
02:22:06,417 --> 02:22:09,557
Don't you know Aakhri Pasta?
- No. No.

2382
02:22:09,621 --> 02:22:11,999
I run London's most
successful marriage bureau.

2383
02:22:12,056 --> 02:22:13,967
For cartoons like you

2384
02:22:14,025 --> 02:22:15,868
I've even started a
mobile marriage bureau

2385
02:22:15,927 --> 02:22:17,634
Press 1 for engagement.

2386
02:22:17,695 --> 02:22:18,867
Press 2 for marriage.

2387
02:22:18,930 --> 02:22:20,603
And to get married again...

2388
02:22:20,665 --> 02:22:22,804
Press your first wife's neck.

2389
02:22:23,101 --> 02:22:24,774
I am joking.

2390
02:22:24,836 --> 02:22:26,577
Hey, Bombay duck, come here.

2391
02:22:26,771 --> 02:22:28,148
Your father must have
taken one look at..

2392
02:22:28,406 --> 02:22:29,612
.. Your pregnant mother's stomach...

2393
02:22:29,674 --> 02:22:32,416
...and said to her
"This is our child, right".

2394
02:22:32,510 --> 02:22:34,786
And she must have replied yes.

2395
02:22:34,846 --> 02:22:36,723
And then she must have
turned to the driver and said...

2396
02:22:36,781 --> 02:22:38,658
..."I am joking".

2397
02:22:38,716 --> 02:22:39,888
Mamma mia.

2398
02:22:40,485 --> 02:22:41,930
Go get me a cold drink.

2399
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:43,124
Go.

2400
02:22:43,621 --> 02:22:45,897
The guests have arrived.

2401
02:22:45,957 --> 02:22:47,129
The auspicious time is passing by.

2402
02:22:47,191 --> 02:22:48,932
Let's get on with the marriage,
come on. - Come.

2403
02:22:50,028 --> 02:22:51,666
Call the brides.

2404
02:22:59,671 --> 02:23:01,207
Now call the grooms.

2405
02:23:01,806 --> 02:23:02,944
Jolly.

2406
02:23:11,916 --> 02:23:13,657
What is happening here?

2407
02:23:13,885 --> 02:23:16,161
Show us your face at least.

2408
02:23:38,242 --> 02:23:39,653
Sunny.
- What is it?

2409
02:23:40,011 --> 02:23:42,514
According to father I
am marrying Henna...

2410
02:23:42,614 --> 02:23:43,957
...and you're marrying Jio.

2411
02:23:44,015 --> 02:23:46,188
What now?
- Why are you tiring yourself

2412
02:23:46,584 --> 02:23:47,961
I've made all the arrangements.

2413
02:23:52,056 --> 02:23:54,627
What is this going on now?

2414
02:24:17,949 --> 02:24:20,930
Priest, begin the ceremony.

2415
02:24:20,985 --> 02:24:22,658
Stop!

2416
02:24:22,987 --> 02:24:25,627
Stop this marriage right now

2417
02:24:27,025 --> 02:24:29,596
Great, JD.

2418
02:24:31,963 --> 02:24:33,806
First you break our friendship.

2419
02:24:33,965 --> 02:24:35,706
Then our break their relation.

2420
02:24:35,767 --> 02:24:37,713
Then you make my daughter elope...

2421
02:24:37,769 --> 02:24:39,806
...and then get him
married to your son.

2422
02:24:39,871 --> 02:24:43,114
You're still a dacoit.

2423
02:24:43,975 --> 02:24:48,082
This man who you all know as JD...

2424
02:24:48,146 --> 02:24:49,853
...what was his reality?

2425
02:24:50,548 --> 02:24:51,720
Do you know who he is?

2426
02:24:52,717 --> 02:24:57,063
He's a dacoit from
Gangapur area in India.

2427
02:24:57,121 --> 02:24:58,794
Murderer. Plunderer.

2428
02:24:59,190 --> 02:25:00,601
Oh, my.

2429
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:04,665
JD a dacoit.

2430
02:25:04,896 --> 02:25:06,204
A bandit.

2431
02:25:06,597 --> 02:25:08,076
Jagga Dacoit.

2432
02:25:08,299 --> 02:25:09,778
Batuk.

2433
02:25:12,837 --> 02:25:13,941
See.

2434
02:25:15,807 --> 02:25:20,847
Who told you that your
daughter is marrying my son?

2435
02:25:20,912 --> 02:25:24,359
What's there to see or hear?

2436
02:25:25,683 --> 02:25:28,926
Look, JD's son Jolly.

2437
02:25:33,091 --> 02:25:34,900
He's not my son.

2438
02:25:35,626 --> 02:25:36,764
He's the driver.

2439
02:25:38,296 --> 02:25:41,175
JD has only one legitimate son.

2440
02:25:41,232 --> 02:25:42,768
And everyone knows who he is.

2441
02:25:43,768 --> 02:25:46,612
We just need to uncover his face.
- No, dad, please.

2442
02:25:49,607 --> 02:25:51,245
He's not my son either.

2443
02:25:52,777 --> 02:25:56,054
He's not his real son.

2444
02:25:56,781 --> 02:25:59,227
His real son is there.

2445
02:25:59,283 --> 02:26:02,059
We just need to uncover his face.

2446
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:05,829
You fool. This is his son.

2447
02:26:06,791 --> 02:26:09,237
He is not my son either.

2448
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:10,803
He's not.

2449
02:26:14,298 --> 02:26:16,335
Then who is JD's son?

2450
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:25,147
I am JD's real son. Jolly

2451
02:26:28,346 --> 02:26:33,091
I will explain how and
why all this happened.

2452
02:26:56,307 --> 02:26:57,411
Papa!

2453
02:27:04,715 --> 02:27:07,821
Enough! That's enough!

2454
02:27:08,186 --> 02:27:11,099
If they're bad, then
what are you, papa?

2455
02:27:11,522 --> 02:27:14,162
If they aren't worthy of
being called your son-in-law...

2456
02:27:14,792 --> 02:27:16,931
...are you worthy of
being called a father?

2457
02:27:17,295 --> 02:27:19,400
You set out to get your daughter...

2458
02:27:19,463 --> 02:27:21,170
...married to JD's son.

2459
02:27:21,933 --> 02:27:26,382
But before that did you even
bother to ask for our approval?

2460
02:27:26,804 --> 02:27:29,250
You only used your daughter like toys.

2461
02:27:29,807 --> 02:27:31,184
You just wound the
keys and let them loose.

2462
02:27:31,709 --> 02:27:33,086
Go on, fall in love.

2463
02:27:34,178 --> 02:27:37,853
And when we did, you said "Let's go".

2464
02:27:39,851 --> 02:27:42,297
I feel ashamed to call you father.

2465
02:27:42,353 --> 02:27:43,457
Bobby.

2466
02:27:54,332 --> 02:27:56,243
If you want to slap
someone then slap me.

2467
02:27:58,502 --> 02:28:00,413
All my life I called
you illegitimate...

2468
02:28:01,839 --> 02:28:03,182
...instead of calling you brother.

2469
02:28:04,508 --> 02:28:08,786
I always humiliated the
one I should have respected.

2470
02:28:09,981 --> 02:28:12,393
If I wouldn't have bothered about

2471
02:28:13,918 --> 02:28:15,454
...legitimate and illegitimate,
then I might not have see this day.

2472
02:28:17,455 --> 02:28:22,495
Daboo. Chintu couldn't understand
the important of relationships.

2473
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:23,966
Not at all.

2474
02:28:24,962 --> 02:28:26,873
Forgive me, please.

2475
02:28:29,166 --> 02:28:33,137
Chintu. Don't blame yourself.

2476
02:28:34,939 --> 02:28:38,182
Don't forget, I am your elder brother.

2477
02:28:40,077 --> 02:28:42,956
I left no opportunity to malign you.

2478
02:28:44,982 --> 02:28:46,427
Forgive me, brother.

2479
02:28:48,185 --> 02:28:49,562
Forgive me.

2480
02:29:11,943 --> 02:29:13,081
Mamma mia, mamma mia.

2481
02:29:13,144 --> 02:29:14,248
What a happy ending.

2482
02:29:14,312 --> 02:29:15,518
Let me take a picture.

2483
02:29:16,047 --> 02:29:17,549
Everybody say cheese.

2484
02:29:17,815 --> 02:29:19,192
Cheese!

2485
02:29:19,583 --> 02:29:21,119
Oh, God!

2486
02:29:27,591 --> 02:29:28,934
Jagga Dacoit!

2487
02:29:28,993 --> 02:29:31,200
Jagga Dacoit! Jagga Dacoit!

2488
02:29:31,395 --> 02:29:35,241
Dacoit Jagga is back again.

2489
02:29:36,434 --> 02:29:40,007
Now you are all in trouble.

2490
02:29:41,472 --> 02:29:47,150
You've compelled dacoit
Jagga to awaken again.

2491
02:29:49,013 --> 02:29:53,894
The first person that I
will shoot with this gun is...

2492
02:30:04,929 --> 02:30:06,067
You!

2493
02:30:07,598 --> 02:30:08,906
Jagga Dacoit!

2494
02:30:09,066 --> 02:30:10,204
Jagga Dacoit!

2495
02:30:10,267 --> 02:30:13,077
Dacoit. Jagga Dacoit!

2496
02:30:13,137 --> 02:30:15,117
Why are you tiring yourself?

2497
02:30:15,406 --> 02:30:17,044
No, no, no.

2498
02:30:17,108 --> 02:30:18,644
Hail Goddess.

2499
02:30:20,244 --> 02:30:22,554
He's gone crazy!

2500
02:30:22,613 --> 02:30:25,492
Run! Run!

2501
02:30:27,018 --> 02:30:28,156
Run!

2502
02:30:36,327 --> 02:30:37,567
Come out.

2503
02:30:38,462 --> 02:30:40,100
You have awakened Jagga.

2504
02:30:42,066 --> 02:30:46,105
Even the police from 700
villages were scared of Jagga.

2505
02:30:46,937 --> 02:30:48,541
What do you think?

2506
02:30:51,275 --> 02:30:53,255
Jagga.

2507
02:30:53,677 --> 02:30:56,248
You're gonna be buried
into the ground alive.

2508
02:30:56,313 --> 02:30:59,522
Why are you scared?

2509
02:30:59,583 --> 02:31:01,995
You're time is near. Bhau.

2510
02:31:09,260 --> 02:31:10,637
Jolly.

2511
02:31:11,095 --> 02:31:13,097
What is this?

2512
02:31:13,364 --> 02:31:15,071
Jolly's here, Jolly's there.

2513
02:31:15,132 --> 02:31:16,475
How many Jolly's?

2514
02:31:16,967 --> 02:31:18,537
Now face your father's gun.

2515
02:31:18,602 --> 02:31:20,582
No, listen to me.
- Bhau.

2516
02:31:30,181 --> 02:31:32,252
Max. Relax.

2517
02:31:33,117 --> 02:31:35,597
The dacoits have surrounded you.

2518
02:31:36,487 --> 02:31:38,990
So its better that you surrender.

2519
02:31:40,558 --> 02:31:42,094
Can't say about John...

2520
02:31:42,259 --> 02:31:44,671
...but Jagga won't take mercy on you.

2521
02:31:47,064 --> 02:31:48,236
Bhau.

2522
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:51,239
3210...fire.

2523
02:31:59,410 --> 02:32:00,980
Are you suffering from acidity?

2524
02:32:01,579 --> 02:32:03,752
The boy's taken the bait.

2525
02:32:04,014 --> 02:32:05,186
Bhau.

2526
02:32:06,484 --> 02:32:08,521
What the...

2527
02:32:09,487 --> 02:32:11,626
Where did he go?

2528
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:04,247
Bhau. Bhau.

2529
02:33:04,508 --> 02:33:05,680
Behind you.

2530
02:33:08,245 --> 02:33:10,384
Fire.

2531
02:33:10,781 --> 02:33:12,226
The gun's jammed.

2532
02:33:12,283 --> 02:33:15,389
Run!

2533
02:33:22,193 --> 02:33:23,672
Hide. Hide.

2534
02:33:24,662 --> 02:33:27,165
JD respects me a lot.

2535
02:33:27,398 --> 02:33:28,638
I will go and make him alright.

2536
02:33:28,699 --> 02:33:30,235
Give me a white handkerchief.

2537
02:33:31,268 --> 02:33:33,339
JD. JD.

2538
02:33:33,404 --> 02:33:36,351
I know that you won't shoot me.

2539
02:33:36,407 --> 02:33:38,580
Because you respect me.

2540
02:33:38,642 --> 02:33:41,418
Save me.

2541
02:33:41,478 --> 02:33:43,355
The fool.

2542
02:33:43,414 --> 02:33:44,825
He's gone crazy.

2543
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:48,823
I could've been dead had
the bullet hit me. Rascal.

2544
02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:51,326
Jagga uncle. Jagga uncle.

2545
02:33:51,388 --> 02:33:53,390
At least listen to your
friend Prince Charles.

2546
02:33:53,457 --> 02:33:54,731
Stop, JD. Stop.

2547
02:33:54,792 --> 02:33:56,396
You're not in Gangapur.

2548
02:33:56,460 --> 02:33:59,202
You're tax paying member
of the British Empire.

2549
02:33:59,263 --> 02:34:01,243
In the name of queen and country...

2550
02:34:01,298 --> 02:34:02,800
...put down your weapon.

2551
02:34:08,672 --> 02:34:10,379
Mamma mia, Camilla.

2552
02:34:11,275 --> 02:34:12,845
Sunny.

2553
02:34:14,311 --> 02:34:15,449
Come out.

2554
02:35:02,593 --> 02:35:04,573
Where are you running?

2555
02:35:05,262 --> 02:35:07,435
Sunny. Are you okay?
- Sunny.

2556
02:35:07,731 --> 02:35:09,608
Who do you think you are?

2557
02:35:09,867 --> 02:35:12,905
First you put JD to
sleep and awakened Jagga.

2558
02:35:13,804 --> 02:35:17,479
Now you have put Jagga to
sleep and awakened JD again.

2559
02:35:19,209 --> 02:35:20,415
A hug.

2560
02:35:24,915 --> 02:35:28,863
Dad your fine right? Superb. Superb.

2561
02:35:28,919 --> 02:35:30,830
That was great.

2562
02:35:31,588 --> 02:35:34,592
When everything's ending happily...

2563
02:35:35,426 --> 02:35:37,406
...then why don't you
adopt my son-in-law.

2564
02:35:37,594 --> 02:35:40,734
Just give him half
your wealth. Only half.

2565
02:35:40,798 --> 02:35:44,268
Brother, now you are dubbing my lines.

2566
02:35:44,501 --> 02:35:47,345
He's a good boy.

2567
02:35:47,604 --> 02:35:49,811
Adopt him and give him the wealth...

2568
02:35:49,973 --> 02:35:51,350
Shut up!

2569
02:35:52,476 --> 02:35:58,722
Today all three fake
Jolly's will get married.

2570
02:35:58,949 --> 02:36:03,261
But you won't get
married to this Jolly. - Why?

2571
02:36:03,954 --> 02:36:06,935
She will marry Jwala.

2572
02:36:06,990 --> 02:36:10,028
Jwala? Ewww

2573
02:36:15,566 --> 02:36:16,670
Cut it. Superb.

2574
02:36:16,934 --> 02:36:18,880
Superb.

2575
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:24,712
Give me a hug.

2576
02:36:27,511 --> 02:36:29,616
The wall's falling down.

2577
02:36:32,549 --> 02:36:33,687
Left.

2578
02:36:33,751 --> 02:36:36,789
Get ice.

2579
02:36:36,854 --> 02:36:38,424
Not like this.

2580
02:36:40,491 --> 02:36:42,664
Naughty.

2581
02:36:43,427 --> 02:36:44,838
JD sir, you're just..

2582
02:36:47,331 --> 02:36:49,470
What else did he say?

2583
02:36:49,533 --> 02:36:51,308
Enough.

2584
02:36:51,368 --> 02:36:52,506
Take it to that length.

2585
02:36:53,604 --> 02:36:55,709
Jolly.

2586
02:36:59,943 --> 02:37:05,017
"You're an idiot, you're a fool."

2587
02:37:05,282 --> 02:37:07,853
I can see your nose.

2588
02:37:07,918 --> 02:37:10,694
"Whatever, whatever we do."

2589
02:37:19,663 --> 02:37:20,937
Cut it.

2590
02:37:21,331 --> 02:37:22,833
"Sweet.."

2591
02:37:22,900 --> 02:37:24,846
"..meat."

2592
02:37:26,970 --> 02:37:28,779
"Papa plays the band."

2593
02:37:29,540 --> 02:37:32,077
How will we get married?

2594
02:37:32,342 --> 02:37:34,344
Shut up, Bobby.
- You shut up.

2595
02:37:35,612 --> 02:37:37,614
Papa.

2596
02:37:38,482 --> 02:37:40,428
Look who I brought along.

2597
02:37:40,484 --> 02:37:43,931
Beauty.

2598
02:37:44,755 --> 02:37:45,995
Beauty.

2599
02:37:46,056 --> 02:37:48,058
Beauty.

2600
02:37:48,325 --> 02:37:49,963
Papa, she's your daughter-in-law.

2601
02:37:50,594 --> 02:37:51,868
Daughter.

2602
02:37:52,329 --> 02:37:54,366
Daughter.

2603
02:37:56,967 --> 02:37:58,742
Papa, give her a hug sideways.

2604
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:03,947
"But papa's sitting on
our dreams like dynamite."

2605
02:38:04,541 --> 02:38:07,784
"But papa's sitting on
our dreams like dynamite."

2606
02:38:07,845 --> 02:38:10,155
"Dynamite."

2607
02:38:11,114 --> 02:38:13,185
Driver. Take this.

2608
02:38:14,384 --> 02:38:15,556
Have groundnuts.

2609
02:38:16,720 --> 02:38:17,892
And action.

2610
02:38:17,955 --> 02:38:19,400
Mamma mia.

2611
02:38:21,925 --> 02:38:23,529
I love you.

2612
02:38:24,695 --> 02:38:26,504
But I'm still angry with you.
- Why?

2613
02:38:27,364 --> 02:38:29,435
Anoint him with the whiskey.

2614
02:38:32,669 --> 02:38:33,841
Cut it.

2615
02:38:37,774 --> 02:38:41,551
Sajid Nadiadwala.
- Nadiad, come on.

2616
02:38:41,612 --> 02:38:45,059
Get up, get up, your famous step.

2617
02:38:46,583 --> 02:38:47,994
"Papa plays the band."

2618
02:38:49,152 --> 02:38:51,428
Great!

2619
02:38:53,857 --> 02:38:55,097
"Papa plays the band."

2620
02:38:55,158 --> 02:38:57,638
Your movie's a hit,
the result's are out.

2621
02:38:57,961 --> 02:39:00,032
You don't have to cry over it.

2622
02:39:00,097 --> 02:39:03,544
We'll..

2623
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:05,739
Everyone's out.

2624
02:39:05,802 --> 02:39:07,713
Those days are gone.

2625
02:39:07,771 --> 02:39:09,045
It's the age of multiplexes.

2626
02:39:11,675 --> 02:39:13,245
Its all bottles and things now.

2627
02:39:13,510 --> 02:39:15,490
What's bottle got to do with this?
