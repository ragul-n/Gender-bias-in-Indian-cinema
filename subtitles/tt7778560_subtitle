'With the blessings of my parents
and my guru'

'I present my small dream before you.
Hail Lord Ram.'

3
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:18,194
I have been taking
Prakash's tender many years

4
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:21,950
even this tender will be mine again.

5
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:25,786
Oh, my God!

6
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:29,371
There's been an accident.
- It's a pregnant woman, go and check.

7
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:31,286
Oh, my God!

8
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:34,417
Oh, my God! - What happened?
- Call the ambulance immediately.

9
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:36,614
Wait.
- Please save us, sir.

10
00:03:37,358 --> 00:03:39,642
I will save you.
- Sir!

11
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,687
Oh, my God! No!

12
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,565
'They are contract killers
who kill people'

13
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,268
'not because of personal enmity,
but for money.'

14
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:57,633
'The man behind this
is none other than...'

15
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:02,574
Sir, job done.
- Well done.

16
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:07,668
'Bhirava, the ruler of injustice'

17
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:10,215
'is the trustee of this temple.'

18
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:21,349
Your job is done.
- Very good, Bhirava.

19
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:24,328
Dev always ruined my business

20
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:27,985
now, there is nobody
to take this tender.

21
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:33,054
Now, it's just me.
I will pay you extra 25 lakhs.

22
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:34,772
Thank you.

23
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,517
'For money, he killed his wife'

24
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:39,994
'fearing that he would lose
his father-in-law's wealth'

25
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:43,183

26
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,613
'He is so cunning that'

27
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:48,545
'though he got many people killed,
there is no proof against him'

28
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,442
'because he appoints his close aides
and confidants'

29
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:53,975
'for first and second layer.'

30
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,167
'He hires contract killers from'

31
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,678
'Orissa, Bihar, Jharkand and UP

34
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:10,520
'After the deal is over,
they destroy all the used SIM cards.'

35
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,348
'Running the company under
the name Bhirava Finance'

00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:17,355
'by getting people killed stealthily
from the law'

38
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,776
'is living as VIP in the society.'

39
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,617
I borrowed money
because I was in need of it

40
00:05:28,697 --> 00:05:31,923
but he thrashed,
took away my bike just for Rs 2000.

41
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:34,614
You should've told him my name.
- I did but he didn't care.

42
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:36,748
He didn't care?
- No.

43
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:38,359
Who is he?
- Raja.

44
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,819
It seems he stays in the market.

45
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:42,109
Raja. Who is Raja?

46
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:44,235
Hey, auto driver!
- What is it?

47
00:05:44,315 --> 00:05:45,076
Who is Raja here?

48
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:47,482
You stay in Karnataka,
don't you know who Raja is?

49
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:49,328
Why? Shouldn't have I asked you?

50
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:53,206
He's the flower of the mountain that
is blooming in every Kannadigas heart.

51
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,515
If he is flower, our boss is the Sun.

52
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:59,375
He will wither if my boss
opens his eyes.

53
00:05:59,455 --> 00:06:04,982
Hey, where is he?
- He's here, there, and everywhere.

54
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:07,573
Is he Wi-Fi to be everywhere?

55
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:10,963
Or is he Narsimha
who was in Bhakta Prahlad movie?

56
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:17,189
Hey, he's the Bhakta Prahlad
who impressed Narsimha with his devotion.

57
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:19,783
Bhakta Prahlad? You mean, is he a kid?

58
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:23,159
Yes, he's kid to the one who loves him,
but Keechaka to the one who annoys him.

59
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,647
If you give respect,
he's Appu and he's a king by nature.

60
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:28,217
He's a leader for the brave
and Basava for the courageous.

61
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,465
He's a great warrior
and as powerful as the earth.

62
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:33,123
He's a great fighter
and wonderful actor.

63
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:35,507
He's a son of royal family
and the second name for victory.

64
00:06:35,587 --> 00:06:38,159
He's the king without a crown,
the one and only...

65
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,013
Anjani Putra (Son of Lord Anjaneya).

66
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:45,156
Hey, superb!

67
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:47,866
After hearing you,
I've become his big fan.

68
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:49,642
Can I meet him just once?

69
00:06:49,722 --> 00:06:52,925
Okay. - Boss, we've not come here
to give him ratings,

70
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,390
but to thrash him.
- No, no.

71
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,597
Seeing his voting and rating,

72
00:06:57,677 --> 00:07:00,074
I think chatting
is better than fighting.

73
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,037
You! Boss..

74
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:05,191
I want to meet him only once.

75
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:08,614
Boss, you stay quiet.
Go and get him here!

76
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,962
Hey!
- I beg of you, please don't.

77
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:41,513
What shine, what glamour!

78
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:43,908
Whatever they praised
about your personality

79
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:45,711
was very less, I think.

80
00:07:46,372 --> 00:07:48,857
We shouldn't force anyone to praise us.

81
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,732
If people like us, they'll respect us,
if not, they will shun us.

82
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:55,740
He's Raja!

83
00:07:57,424 --> 00:08:02,599
Hey, just not Raja, he's Rajanna!

84
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:06,360
I'll give you the money that
I had to give it to your boss,

85
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,066
go and thrash him.

86
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:23,809
Thrash him!

87
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:40,985
Oh no!

88
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:44,069
I should've kept quiet when people
told his highlights to me. Sir?

89
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,083
Where's the guy who said he was my fan?
- I don't know, sir.

90
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:49,610
I am here!

91
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:52,305
Hey, what are you doing there?

92
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:56,055
Sir, I'm anointing your cutout
with milk.

93
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,167
When did you arrange for these things?

94
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:03,649
Sir, you shouldn't ask fans about
when they built the cutout, garland it,

95
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,219
and anoint it with milk.

96
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:09,525
We will donate food as well as blood.

97
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:13,695
Sir, not just simple cut out,
we have built your temple in our hearts!

98
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:15,541
Okay, get down slowly.

99
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:18,987
Sir!
- Enough of this now, leave.

100
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:21,721
I can't leave without hearing your
great dialogue and seeing you fight.

101
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,468
Sir, please dance a
few steps to entertain us.

102
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:28,205
No.
- Sir, we're your fans, please dance.

103
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:31,231
Okay.
- He agreed!

104
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:35,156
To all the art lovers!

105
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:38,018
In just a few minutes,

106
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,818
there will be great
dance performance here.

107
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:44,610
Karnataka's Raja is coming
to entertain you all!

108
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:47,973
Boss?
- Play the music.

109
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:02,416
Very good! Come on, do it again!

110
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,371
Hey!
- Sir, we shall leave now.

111
00:14:29,074 --> 00:14:30,055
Who's this old lady?

112
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,773
I had been to Kaddi's house
to ask for the interest money,

113
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:36,013
his house was locked, this old lady
was sitting there, so I hijacked her.

114
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:38,782
If people in the market learns about this,
I will be defamed.

115
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:41,866
Sir, if you be so generous,
it will be difficult to run the business.

116
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:43,864
You have to hit the fruit with a stone
if you want to eat it.

117
00:14:43,944 --> 00:14:46,574
Hey, I got a call.
- Get me a juice.

118
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:50,137
I will turn on the speaker,
just hear what Shekhar has to say.

119
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,261
Hello. - When are you coming
to repay the interest money?

120
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:56,516
I'm not coming, but leaving.

121
00:14:57,322 --> 00:14:59,436
I've packed my luggage.
I am leaving this city.

122
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:01,796
What about this old lady then?
- You take care of her.

123
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:06,282
You idiot!
- Hey, what are you saying?

124
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,125
My grandma will ask for soup
with steamed bread in the morning to eat.

125
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:13,256
She will ask for beer with pilaf.

126
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:16,270
She will ask for mutton chops
if you give her chips with liquor.

127
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,857
I had got ruined by taking loan
from everyone to fulfill her needs.

128
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,798
You saved me.

129
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,705
Hey, what are you saying?

130
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,901
Didn't you reform even
after seeing Rajkumar's movie?

131
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:28,881
No matter how emotional you make me,

132
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,920
but if my grandma is with me,
I will die of loose motions.

133
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:34,203
Please consider my grandma as yours
and take care of her.

134
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:36,119
Hey!
- Hang up the phone!

135
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,285
I've landed myself in deep trouble.

136
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:40,605
Maybe.

137
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:43,093
Ma'am, what I am saying actually...

138
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:46,691
I don't want to hear anything.
I am famished.

139
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:49,926
Get me a pilaf,
one beer, one quarter bottle of liquor,

140
00:15:50,006 --> 00:15:52,800
one plate chops, and two chicken legs.

141
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,795
Ma'am, I don't have chicken legs,
but I have hands, do you want that?

142
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,331
Give me your hand.
- Oh, this old lady bit me!

143
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:03,151
Seth is always surrounded by girls.

144
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,354
He doesn't give even one to us.

145
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:07,449
Geeta, I am dying for you!

146
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,155
Listen to me..
- I am dying!

147
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,141
I've called Geeta, she's on her way.

148
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,676
No, I know she won't come. I am dying.
- Listen.

149
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:16,094
Sanjay can't live without Geeta!

150
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:18,046
Sanjay weds Geeta, part 2.

151
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:20,452
I have a doubt that if anyone falls
from here, they'll even get injured,

152
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:22,742
but he's talking about
committing suicide.

153
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:25,195
Sanju, stop!
- I will jump from here and die!

154
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,819
You scoundrel, go to hell!

155
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,657
I will hit you with my slippers!
May the cow pee on you!

156
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:32,111
May you rot in hell! You scoundrel.
- Hey!

157
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,202
May your dead body lie on the road!
Get down!

158
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:36,270
I don't know if he'll die
after jumping from there,

159
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,214
but he will die listening
to her abuses, for sure.

160
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:40,687
For what?

161
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,995
For hers love.
- Oh I see.

162
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,377
Geeta, I love you!

163
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:58,296
Sanju, Geeta is here.

164
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:12,111
Geeta, if you don't agree, I will die.
- Sanju, don't!

165
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,980
Don't die, I love you.

166
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,990
Sure?
- Yes, please get down.

167
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,981
Geeta!
- Move away!

168
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:22,076
Talk to him.
- Look, I have a weakness.

169
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:24,775
Now that you've agreed,
I'll accept all your weaknesses, tell me.

170
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:28,150
Look, I can't have
the same meal every day.

171
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:31,562
I eat different kinds of breakfasts.

172
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:33,957
There should be some variety.
- Hey, no problem.

173
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:37,064
Not just in food, but even in love..
- Then?

174
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:38,436
In love?

175
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,515
Look, I liked you so I proposed to you.

176
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,318
Tomorrow if I like him,
I will propose to him.

177
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,531
The next day,
if I like him, I will propose to him.

178
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:50,346
If I like him, I will propose to him.

179
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:52,519
Me?
- Yes, sir.

180
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:55,569
I will not let you do that,
I will get married to you soon.

181
00:17:55,802 --> 00:17:56,958
No, Sanju.

182
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,432
It's highly impossible to live
with one person all my life.

183
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,591
You! I followed you so much that

184
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:06,152
my shoes tore.
Did I come behind you for Wi-Fi?

185
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:07,554
I was even thinking of
committing suicide for you.

186
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,972
I have to hit myself with my own shoes.

187
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:14,902
You're not G for Geeta, but C for cheater,
T for terror, and D for Darn... - Hey!

188
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,752
I didn't tell that.

189
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:21,397
You meet me later,
I will teach you a lesson!

190
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,411
Guys always want to do social service.

191
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:26,175
Thank you.
- It's okay.

192
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:29,500
Buddy..

193
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,252
Hey, where did the girl go?

194
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:32,935
She told me I love you.

195
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:35,211
You're mistaken, she didn't tell you,

196
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,841
but she gave an example
about you to him.

197
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:39,979
Didn't you hear what she said?

198
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:42,210
Yes. Where did she go?

199
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,728
You did the right thing.
- Look, there she is.

200
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:47,606
It's okay, come on.
- Hey, stop. Come out.

201
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:49,931
What do you think love is?

202
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,326
You change guys like you change clothes.

203
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:56,292
Do you take guys to be like SIM card that
you can throw them to take a new offer?

204
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,868
Do you think guys are like
the security guards of the ATM

205
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:00,982
who sit there and watch people
swipe their cards? - I love you.

206
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:03,579
Hey.
- Again?

207
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:07,326
I told you that to shut your mouth.
What do you know about this matter?

208
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,325
He has parents to take care of
and a sister who goes to the college.

209
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:12,811
He has to get her married.
It is his responsibility.

210
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:15,444
He shouldn't spoil his life
by following me to love him.

211
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:19,222
I became characterless just to save him
from getting ruined. Get it?

212
00:19:19,302 --> 00:19:21,035
Don't talk without knowing anything.

213
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:23,232
Ma'am, I feel like touching your feet.

214
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:26,344
We misunderstood you
without knowing your good intentions.

215
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:28,680
Please bless me that
I find a girl like you.

216
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,213
G for! - Gauramma!
- K for! - Kempamma!

217
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:33,727
D for.. - Hey!
- I mean, she's a goddess. - Okay.

218
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,493
Please, you may leave.

219
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,380
I'll check the documents.
- Okay.

220
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,726
You go meet the boss.
- Okay.

221
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:55,175
Have you mentioned everything
correctly in the file?

222
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:57,745
Mr. Somashekhar,
the owner of SSK Exports, sent me here.

223
00:19:57,825 --> 00:19:59,212
Who do you want to get killed?

224
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:04,417
SP Suryaprakash.
- What's the matter?

225
00:20:04,497 --> 00:20:06,309
Our sir had a small case on him,

226
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:09,613
SP has made our sir's life miserable
because of that.

227
00:20:09,693 --> 00:20:10,596
What's the case.

228
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,875
Three girls who worked
in our garment factory

229
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:14,744
went missing for one month.

230
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:16,220
They didn't go missing.

231
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:20,856
Your owner raped them and murdered them.

232
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:25,809
If this matter leaks
during SP's enquiry,

233
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:29,585
your owner will be jailed.
So, you've come to me.

234
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:33,351
Don't worry, I will handle it.

235
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:37,295
You've come to Bhirava finance,

236
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,781
to mortgage your property
documents and take loan.

237
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:44,575
You have to maintain
the record everywhere.

238
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,193
Buy a new SIM card.

239
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:50,922
You'll receive calls from new numbers.

240
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:54,725
You have to receive them.
For any reason,

241
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:58,211
you shouldn't call anyone
from that number.

242
00:20:58,379 --> 00:20:59,417
Okay, sir.

243
00:20:59,497 --> 00:21:02,071
Who do we have to pay the money to?
- You'll get a call.

244
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:05,249
You may leave now.

245
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:07,333
Suri.
- Sir?

246
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:11,088
Collect the details of SP Suryaprakash.
- Okay, sir.

247
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:12,875
Gopi.
- Yes, sir?

248
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:14,837
SP Suryaprakash.
- Okay, sir.

249
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,482
Mano, buy a new SIM card immediately
and call me.

250
00:21:17,562 --> 00:21:18,688
Okay, sir.

251
00:21:49,904 --> 00:21:53,094
I feel very relaxed
when I visit this temple.

252
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:54,483
Is it?
- Yes.

253
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,077
Even I... - How dare you try to run
when we ask you for the interest money?

254
00:21:57,802 --> 00:22:00,162
Swati, listen, you go shopping,

255
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:02,487
I'll be back in five minutes. Okay?
- Okay, bye.

256
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,653
You don't have money in your pocket,
but you want to go around with girls?

257
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:07,709
You also tell them that
you'll take them to Bangkok.

258
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:10,081
I will thrash you.
- Sir, I like sandwich.

259
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,872
Even we like tomato chutney.

260
00:22:12,952 --> 00:22:16,120
Hey, thrash them.
- Leave me, sir. - Leave him.

261
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,240
Hey, get going. - Leave.
- Don't forget to pay the money tomorrow.

262
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:23,959
Raja, your girlfriend is coming this way.
- Hi.

263
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:26,354
Please come. Have a seat.

264
00:22:26,434 --> 00:22:31,692
Thank you.
- "Whose face did I see in the morning?"

265
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:35,465
"I don't know if my destiny
is sitting behind me."

266
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:39,495
Buddy, what could I do? Seeing her face,
I could remember this song.

267
00:22:39,575 --> 00:22:42,281
No problem.
Everyone sings the same song seeing me.

268
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:45,207
By the way,
why were you thrashing that guy?

269
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:46,890
He is the owner of the machine.

270
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,039
Machine?
- I mean...

271
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,836
Millet machine, washing machine,
put the clothes... - Hey!

272
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,290
It's just that I had given money on loan
to the Seth.

273
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,358
So, I was asking him
when he'll return the money.

274
00:22:57,438 --> 00:23:00,197
Oh, do you give money on loan?
- Yes.. - Bank business.

275
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,475
How much interest does your bank charge?

276
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,993
Fire interest.
- Fire interest?

277
00:23:04,073 --> 00:23:06,821
The interest rate is like fire.

278
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:09,484
We give him shock if he's unable
to repay the money.

279
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:12,206
He should die paying
the interest amount.

280
00:23:12,286 --> 00:23:13,725
But he won't be able to pay the loan.

281
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:16,050
It's like that. Do you know?

282
00:23:16,342 --> 00:23:18,877
She's a guest here. Get something chill
from the fridge for her to drink.

283
00:23:18,957 --> 00:23:20,407
Go. - No.
- She doesn't want it.

284
00:23:20,487 --> 00:23:22,008
Hey, go!

285
00:23:22,872 --> 00:23:25,795
Actually, I had come to the temple.
- Did you visit it?

286
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:28,819
Cool drink.
- Hey?

287
00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:30,501
What is this?
- You've come here for the first time.

288
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:32,511
Guests are incarnation of God.
Please have.

289
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:35,723
What's this? - You asked me
to get something chill from the fridge.

290
00:23:35,803 --> 00:23:37,323
In our fridge only this was available.

291
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:39,566
Won't she drink this?
- Oh no.

292
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:41,902
Raja. - Sorry.
- Which brand do you drink, tell me?

293
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:44,694
I will get all kinds of snacks for you
to eat with this.

294
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:46,937
I don't want anything. You have it.

295
00:23:47,017 --> 00:23:49,157
Oh, so sorry. - Hello.
- I don't want anything. I will leave. Bye.

296
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,273
As we've opened it, let's drink it.

297
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:01,797
I will drink 3/4th
and you drink 1/4th okay? - Oh my God!

298
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:06,037
Won't she think that I am a drunkard?

299
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:07,673
Take out all the things
from the fridge first.

300
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:10,955
Okay, we'll keep only tea or coffee
in the fridge.

301
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:23,992
My relatives have been waiting for you
from a long time. Please come inside.

302
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,640
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

303
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,280
Have a seat.
- Malathi, call sister-in-law. - Okay.

304
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:35,862
Greetings.
- Greetings, please have a seat.

305
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:38,759
We've planned to organize veneration
in the coming month of Karthik.

306
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:42,766
When Muthuraj was alive,
he would perform the veneration.

307
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:45,301
You all came and graced the function.

308
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:47,334
You've stopped coming now.

309
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:49,659
Even we want to come, but...

310
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,445
We are very busy with our work.

311
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:54,401
Just because you have stopped coming,

312
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:57,508
some other people are
trying to rule that place.

313
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:59,577
Rule?
- Yes, ma'am.

314
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:02,067
Your husband, the Godly man,
when he was alive,

315
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:05,173
he had written 1.5 acres of land
in Bangalore for the temple 28 years ago.

316
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:07,380
Before we could make the documents

317
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,522
and get it registered, he died.

318
00:25:10,602 --> 00:25:12,917
Now the price is 18 crore rupees.

319
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:15,849
The curator of our temple, Bhirava,

320
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:19,003
he is hell bent on acquiring
that property.

321
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:23,606
Why don't you remove him from the post?
- Who can go against him?

322
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:27,975
All the villagers have decided

323
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:31,877
to keep Bhirava away
from the temple premises.

324
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:36,188
We all wish that Satyaraj
should become the curator.

325
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,348
Uncle, why me?

326
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:42,497
Satyaraj, this is the respect
given by the villagers to us.

327
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:46,843
You are the right person for that post.
- Okay, sister-in-law.

328
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:52,860
We all will come to the temple and stay
there until the veneration gets over.

329
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:57,894
Let's register that 1.5 acres of land
to the temple.

330
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,534
Okay, ma'am. We shall leave now.
- Okay.

331
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,218
Chikka, look there.

332
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:06,748
It was superb.

333
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:11,760
The entire flower market
is coming to our office.

334
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:15,407
Hi.
- Hi, cheergirls, please come.

335
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:17,403
Only one person can sit as
there's only one chair. - No problem.

336
00:26:17,483 --> 00:26:19,319
Where's Raja?
- Why Raja? I am the mantri, I am here.

337
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:22,392
We've not come here to see the poster,
but the picture.

338
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:24,880
Counter?
- No, encounter.

339
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:28,104
What's the matter?
- I was in need of Rs. 30,000 urgently.

340
00:26:28,184 --> 00:26:29,576
Okay, we can't say no to girls.

341
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,959
What do you want to mortgage?
- Mortgage?

342
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:35,113
We didn't get anything.
- No problem.

343
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,994
Tell this girl in pink
color dress to sit here.

344
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:37,968
Let she be here for three days.

345
00:26:38,048 --> 00:26:40,990
We'll play with her, then you can repay
the money and take her.

346
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,264
Is it okay?

347
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:43,608
Hey!
- No.

348
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:44,893
Shut up.
- No, C.

349
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:46,341
I will talk to Raja.

350
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:50,196
Go away. - Then you won't get the money.
- Pinky, sit here.

351
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:57,674
Hey! Hey!

352
00:27:10,932 --> 00:27:12,138
Geeta, hi.

353
00:27:12,371 --> 00:27:14,932
Raja is here.

354
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:16,801
You've brought everyone
from the ladies hostel here.

355
00:27:16,881 --> 00:27:18,061
Have a seat.
- Thank you.

356
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:20,467
She's my friend Anita.
She's got a job. - Hi.

357
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:22,231
So, we asked her to give us treat.

358
00:27:22,311 --> 00:27:24,486
So, as you know it is month end
and we don't have cash.

359
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:26,075
She's even crossed
the credit card limit.

360
00:27:26,155 --> 00:27:28,739
So, we need Rs. 30,000 loan from you.

361
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,935
No problem. Kari...
- Okay, boss.

362
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:32,769
Why would you need
Rs. 30,000 for the treat?

363
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:34,872
Yes, actually we asked her to
give us treat in the Le Méridien Hotel.

364
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:37,010
So, you know it is very expensive.
That's why.

365
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,591
I've heard people taking loan
for their friends,

366
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:42,521
but you're the friend who's taking a loan
for a friend so that she can throw a party.

367
00:27:42,723 --> 00:27:45,106
Boss...
- Give it to her. - Okay.

368
00:27:45,982 --> 00:27:47,419
We'll return it in three days.

369
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,760
No problem. - But you didn't tell me
about the interest. - No.

370
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,536
Rs. 3000.
- Rs. 3000? - Fire interest.

371
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:54,837
That's only for business,
not for friends.

372
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:56,286
No problem,
you can give me whenever you want.

373
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:58,342
Thank you.
- Womanizer.

374
00:27:58,422 --> 00:27:59,686
Enjoy.

375
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:01,286
Will you have anything cold to drink?

376
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:02,970
No thanks.
- Something chilled?

377
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,235
No, nothing please.
- Hot drinks?

378
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:07,875
You are many, will you have
a quarter bottle of liquor? - No. - Hey!

379
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:09,791
No. - Half?
- We don't want anything.

380
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:12,396
I was asking about tea or coffee?
Did you think I will offer you liquor?

381
00:28:12,476 --> 00:28:14,721
Hey, go away. Don't feel offended.
- No, please.

382
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:17,887
Coffee!
- Chhotu!

383
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:20,738
He makes really good coffee.
- Is it?

384
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:23,507
Thank you.
- Actually, you know what...

385
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:25,726
I am so sorry.

386
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:27,455
No problem.

387
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,466
Tell her that her sari was stuck
in the door.

388
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:58,918
SP has only one weakness,
that is his wife.

389
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,912
He's booked two tickets
for the matinee show in Robin Theater.

390
00:33:04,992 --> 00:33:06,839
You have to kill him there.

391
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,767
In the theater?
- Yes.

392
00:33:18,883 --> 00:33:21,360
Come on, yes..
- There's place here.

393
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,709
Come on.
- It is Geeta. - Hey!

394
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:25,636
Give it to me.
- 'Hi, Raja.'

395
00:33:25,716 --> 00:33:27,517
Hi, Geeta. What is the matter?

396
00:33:27,597 --> 00:33:29,398
I had to return you the money.

397
00:33:29,478 --> 00:33:31,921
It's not urgent. You can give me later.
I've come here to watch a movie.

398
00:33:32,001 --> 00:33:33,159
Which movie?
- Dangal.

399
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:35,040
If you don't mind,
please can I join you?

400
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:38,311
Actually...
But the movie has already begun.

401
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,122
No problem, you go inside,

402
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:42,458
I will call you when I reach there. Okay?
- Okay.

403
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:45,566
Hey.
- I have four tickets with me.

404
00:33:45,646 --> 00:33:47,716
There will be two vacant seats
on either sides.

405
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:50,484
You both watch Dangal and have...
- Hey!

406
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:53,008
Where will you go?
- We'll go to the next theater.

407
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:54,608
Which film is running?

408
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,933
'Andheri Raat Me Diya Tere Haat Me.'

409
00:33:57,132 --> 00:34:00,239
Hey, that's a Marathi movie.
- Language is not important to me.

410
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,657
Body language is very important.
Come on, let's go.

411
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,512
You have to tell me what happened inside
while watching movie.

412
00:34:10,356 --> 00:34:11,559
Enjoy.

413
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:26,289
Tell me.
- SP is leaving.

414
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,717
Okay, you also leave.

415
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,436
SP left from the house.
Tell the boys to be alert. - Okay, sir.

416
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:38,065
Send two guys to the auto stand.
- Listen.

417
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:42,143
Send two guys to come
near the car parking.

418
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:46,547
Hope they are not local boys.
- 'No, sir.'

419
00:34:46,862 --> 00:34:50,320
At any cost, those boys shouldn't know
that we're going to murder SP.

420
00:34:50,717 --> 00:34:53,929
If we miss, we'll be in deep trouble.
- Okay, sir.

421
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,543
He's coming.

422
00:34:59,758 --> 00:35:01,721
Hold until I come.
- 'Okay, sir.'

423
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:04,899
Stay in the parking lot.

424
00:35:08,135 --> 00:35:09,840
Where are you?
- I am in the parking lot.

425
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,359
I can't come to the movie.
- Why?

426
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,488
There's something really wrong.

427
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,274
You come here soon.
- Okay, I will come.

428
00:35:14,354 --> 00:35:15,856
Tell the boys that the target
is approaching.

429
00:35:15,936 --> 00:35:17,106
Is it late?

430
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,423
Sir, forgive me.

431
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:25,016
Forgive me, sir.

432
00:35:25,096 --> 00:35:27,178
Who are you?
- Sir, forgive me. Hey!

433
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:31,325
Hey, leave him!

434
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:34,358
Leave him! Leave me!

435
00:35:34,438 --> 00:35:36,582
Hey, who are you? Leave me!

436
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,451
Dear!

437
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:49,748
Ma'am?

438
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:58,299
I've checked the scanning report.

439
00:36:58,379 --> 00:37:01,162
She's fine.
- Hello, sir. How are you? - I am fine.

440
00:37:01,242 --> 00:37:02,611
Sir, we've started investigating.

441
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:04,748
People who attacked on you
are not from this city.

442
00:37:04,828 --> 00:37:07,599
They are outsiders.
- You mean, contract killers?

443
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,941
Yes, sir. - Did you see how dangerous
your husband's job is?

444
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,020
Such things took place
without your knowledge till now,

445
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,761
but today you witnessed it yourself.

446
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:19,422
Dear, I want to meet the guy
who saved your life.

447
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:22,553
Yes, where's the guy?
- Sir, he admitted you to the hospital.

448
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:24,329
I don't know where he is..
- Listen,

449
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,887
he saved us by risking his life.

450
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:28,300
Can't you get information about him?

451
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,053
Sir, there's a CCTV camera
installed in the adjacent Hospital,

452
00:37:30,133 --> 00:37:32,097
I will check the footages.
- Listen,

453
00:37:32,342 --> 00:37:35,251
you told me that
they are professional killers.

454
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:37,039
They attacked on me today,

455
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,889
they may trouble him tomorrow.
Just leave him alone.

456
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:41,718
Okay, sir.
- Okay.

457
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:45,158
Did you see? This is my life.

458
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:53,323
Why didn't you kill him? Why?

459
00:37:53,861 --> 00:37:57,202
When a policeman was attacked
in such a big place,

460
00:37:57,282 --> 00:37:58,744
everyone were watching,

461
00:37:58,824 --> 00:38:01,898
but how did that guy enter the scene?
Who was he?

462
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:04,118
How is he related to SP?

463
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:06,688
Sir, I don't know.
- Was he from the public

464
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:10,531
or is he an undercover agent
who's watching our activities?

465
00:38:10,611 --> 00:38:13,826
Is he from the opposite gang!
Enquire about him!

466
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:16,432
Okay, sir.
- Scoundrel.

467
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,317
They have censored the movie. So sad.

468
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,746
Kari, what are you doing?

469
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:25,158
Chikka, I'm thinking what you call
these vegetables in English. - Hey!

470
00:38:25,393 --> 00:38:28,185
You should ask the people who know.

471
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,042
Is it? Okay.

472
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:31,841
What do you call this as?
- Pumpkin.

473
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,395
This?
- Earring.

474
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:35,860
Hey! - Potato.
- This? - Drumstick.

475
00:38:36,128 --> 00:38:37,390
This?
- Ladies finger.

476
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,119
This?
- Gents...

477
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,222
I mean, gents finger.

478
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:45,276
Okra is called as ladies finger because
it is as delicate as a woman's finger.

479
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,811
Chikka, how can you say
gooseberries as gents' finger?

480
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:50,533
Players play,
sorcerer performs magic, and you...

481
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,792
Okay, what do you call this as?

482
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,349
Hey, I am Kashinath's fan.
Don't talk to me in double meaning.

483
00:38:58,734 --> 00:39:01,152
Do you know what this is called as?
- No. - Chili.

484
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:03,699
If you talk more,
I will chop off your...

485
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:13,319
Geeta, no matter what you say,
I am unable to forget Anwar.

486
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:15,492
Chaitra, don't be in haste.

487
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:17,747
Raja is here.

488
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:20,060
Hi.
- Hi.

489
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:22,034
Hi, Raja.
- Hi.

490
00:39:22,114 --> 00:39:23,798
Sorry, I couldn't return you
the money that day.

491
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:25,574
So, I called you here.
- No problem.

492
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,618
Have a seat. Let's have a coffee.

493
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:30,013
Raja, you sit here.

494
00:39:30,093 --> 00:39:32,407
You sit there.
- You sit here.

495
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:36,134
Sir, was there any horoscope problem
with the chair?

496
00:39:36,214 --> 00:39:39,429
Raja will suit more
in that place than me.

497
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:43,097
Is he in love?
- Nice ambience.

498
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:45,160
If your madam agrees,
there'll be shower of love.

499
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,205
What nonsense?

500
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:47,642
G for Geeta,

501
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:49,231
are you allergic to L for Love?

502
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:52,245
I am not a senseless girl to fall
for movie dialogues delivered by guys.

503
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:54,850
I am a practical girl
who is clear about life.

504
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,373
What if a guy comes to you suddenly

505
00:39:57,453 --> 00:39:59,511
and proposes to you, what will you do?

506
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:01,287
I will hit him with my slipper.

507
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,394
You can hit a loafer with your slippers.

508
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,630
What if gentleman like Raja
proposes to you?

509
00:40:08,331 --> 00:40:09,604
Raja?
- Yes.

510
00:40:10,503 --> 00:40:13,167
He should be thankful
that a high-five girl like me

511
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:16,053
is friends with a guy who's doing
credit business in the market.

512
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,891
Do you think I will fall for such a guy?

513
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,808
Anyways, according to me,
love should have ethics,

514
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:28,139
morality, and moreover our status
should match. Am I right, Raja?

515
00:40:43,236 --> 00:40:44,326
Raja...

516
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:48,236
Hello madam, speaking in English
won't make you high-five.

517
00:40:48,316 --> 00:40:50,409
Status is not for showing,
you should have humanity too.

518
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,788
What status are you talking about?

519
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:54,556
Do you know what his status is,
who he is? - Chikka!

520
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:56,939
Come on.
- I'm coming.

521
00:41:00,678 --> 00:41:03,178
Geeta, why did you talk like that?

522
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:04,534
Actually...

523
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,349
She wants a high breed dog as a pet
and a high-five guy to fall in love with.

524
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:14,896
No matter if he stays in a hut,
he should have good money.

525
00:41:14,976 --> 00:41:16,041
She is...
- Chikka.

526
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:18,179
I didn't expect she would say that.
- Hey!

527
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:19,709
Hit me.

528
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:21,874
Hit me because I kept quiet
when she spoke about your status

529
00:41:21,954 --> 00:41:23,646
instead of chopping her tongue.

530
00:41:23,726 --> 00:41:25,480
Just shut up and do your work.

531
00:41:29,242 --> 00:41:32,630
Some girls don't understand which
is original and which is second hand.

532
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,064
They need a scapegoat who can take them
out for movies and shopping.

533
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:39,265
They need a husband who has enough
money in the bank to settle abroad.

534
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:41,262
She spoke about Raja's status.

535
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:43,202
She will be shocked to know his status.

536
00:41:43,282 --> 00:41:44,485
Chikka, what are you saying?

537
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:47,081
Do you know who Raja is
and which family he belongs to?

538
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:49,824
Our Raja is the owner
of Raj Group of Companies.

539
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,341
His house is like a palace.

540
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:06,976
'Raja's cousin Lavanya's
wedding got fixed.'

541
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:09,231
'When it was four days for the wedding,'

542
00:42:09,311 --> 00:42:12,105
'Raja threw a party for groom's family.'

543
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:13,869
'Won't you buy us liquor?'

544
00:42:14,056 --> 00:42:16,217
'Shut up, my mom is here.'

545
00:42:17,818 --> 00:42:19,103
'Nothing, mom.'

546
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,959
'Hey girl, tell me.
- I need to talk to you.'

547
00:42:38,134 --> 00:42:39,408
Where are you? I am here.

548
00:42:39,488 --> 00:42:42,060
'I'm inside the house. Come soon.
- Okay.'

549
00:42:50,692 --> 00:42:52,515
'Lavanya.
- Cousin.'

550
00:42:53,262 --> 00:42:55,458
'Where are you?
- I am here.'

551
00:42:56,557 --> 00:43:00,050
'What are you doing here?
What do you want to tell me? - Cousin!'

552
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:02,585
'Lavanya, what's wrong with you?'

553
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,781
'I like you very much.'

554
00:43:05,388 --> 00:43:08,028
'What are you saying?
Are you out of your mind?'

555
00:43:08,448 --> 00:43:11,999
'Cousin, I like you very much. I don't
want to marry him. - Listen to me.'

556
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,406
'I will marry only you, no one else.
- Lavanya, listen to me.'

557
00:43:14,486 --> 00:43:16,696
'Don't say such things. - Cousin,
listen to me. Please. - Leave my hand.'

558
00:43:16,776 --> 00:43:18,776
'You come with me.
- Hey, Lavanya. - Cousin!'

559
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,598
'Hey, what are you doing?
- Dad?'

560
00:43:22,678 --> 00:43:26,089
'Uncle, listen to me.
- I don't want to listen to you.'

561
00:43:26,169 --> 00:43:28,741
'Come with me. - Uncle, listen to me.
- Come here soon!'

562
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:31,884
'What happened?
- Your brother's son has stooped so low.'

563
00:43:31,964 --> 00:43:33,090
'What has he done?'

564
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:38,379
'He misbehaved with his aunt's daughter.
What do we do with him?'

565
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:41,066
'Uncle, why are you shouting?
Calm down.'

566
00:43:41,146 --> 00:43:43,601
'I'll ask him what happened.
- What will you ask him?'

567
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,603
'I saw him holding my daughter's sari.'

568
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:48,823
'Should I tell it before everyone'

569
00:43:48,903 --> 00:43:51,252
'and defame my daughter's name?'

570
00:43:51,332 --> 00:43:53,659
'Uncle..
- Look, don't talk without thinking.'

571
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:55,738
'I am not talking without thinking.'

572
00:43:55,818 --> 00:43:58,694
'Had I known that such loafers stay
in your house'

573
00:43:58,774 --> 00:43:59,861
'I wouldn't have come to this house.'

574
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:03,401
'Uncle, don't talk rubbish.
- Who is talking rubbish?'

575
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:05,533
'He should've been thrown out
of the house'

576
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:07,723
'with his share of property
when his father died.'

577
00:44:07,803 --> 00:44:11,042
'Uncle.. - Don't forget that sister-in-law
is the owner of this house.'

578
00:44:11,122 --> 00:44:12,993
'She may be the owner of this house'

579
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:15,060
'but you were waiting to call us home'

580
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,144
'and humiliate us like this.'

581
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:19,967
'Uncle...
- Ma'am, please come.'

582
00:44:20,047 --> 00:44:24,593
'Ask him what cheap thing
your son has done.'

583
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:28,980
'What did you do?'

584
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,755
'What did you do?'

585
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:33,799
'Sister-in-law.'

586
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:37,490
'Oh, do you think his mistake
will wash away if you slap him?'

587
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,955
'Listen, you stay quiet.'

588
00:44:42,397 --> 00:44:44,979
'Why did you do this?'

589
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:47,608
'I considered you as my own son.'

590
00:44:47,876 --> 00:44:51,147
'You put us shame before
all the relatives.'

591
00:44:51,637 --> 00:44:54,791
'Why did you do this?
- Why are you crying?'

592
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:56,323
'She's the daughter of our house.'

593
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,936
'Just because a third class guy
misbehaved with her'

594
00:44:59,016 --> 00:45:01,952
'we can't let go of our daughter-in-law.
- One moment.'

595
00:45:03,997 --> 00:45:06,088
'No one is third class in this house.'

596
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:09,978
'You have put me to shame
before everyone.'

597
00:45:11,193 --> 00:45:15,105
'Get out of the house! Get out!'

598
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:34,862
'If you try to see me again,
you'll see me dead.'

599
00:45:36,463 --> 00:45:37,981
'Get out!'

600
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:44,349
'Had Raja told the truth that day'

601
00:45:44,663 --> 00:45:46,731
'Lavanya's life would've got ruined.'

602
00:45:47,596 --> 00:45:50,539
'So, he kept mum and left the house.'

603
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:54,768
'He walked away from everyone's life.'

604
00:45:55,142 --> 00:45:57,420
I was working as a servant in his house.

605
00:45:57,806 --> 00:46:01,649
He didn't see my status and
became friends with me. Raja is great.

606
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:06,497
So, even I left the house when he did.

607
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:09,347
She asked him what status he has got
to fall in love with her.

608
00:46:10,235 --> 00:46:12,642
The entire state knows Raja's status.

609
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:18,109
Kari, I will behead everyone
in their house.

610
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:20,703
You get the vehicle,
I will go get the sword. - Okay.

611
00:46:22,642 --> 00:46:24,324
Manu.
- Okay, sir.

612
00:46:25,738 --> 00:46:27,467
Did you find out?
- I am at the theater.

613
00:46:27,547 --> 00:46:29,395
The one who fought
in the theater yesterday,

614
00:46:29,475 --> 00:46:31,778
do you know who he was?
- I don't know who he was.

615
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:33,683
He came in a white color jeep.

616
00:46:33,763 --> 00:46:36,533
They said he came in a white color jeep.
- Try asking everyone.

617
00:46:36,613 --> 00:46:38,554
Okay, sir. let's go.

618
00:46:42,853 --> 00:46:44,465
Swati, come soon.

619
00:46:45,493 --> 00:46:48,437
Raja!
- Geeta?

620
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:51,533
What brings you here at this hour?
- Chaitra.

621
00:46:51,613 --> 00:46:54,068
Geeta, come here soon.
- Swati.

622
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:56,335
Chaitra has eloped with Anwar.

623
00:46:56,415 --> 00:46:58,438
What? - Our parents don't
know anything about it yet.

624
00:46:58,518 --> 00:47:02,106
Geeta, shall we ask Raja to help?
- Raja? - Who is he?

625
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:03,800
Aunt, he is Geeta's friend.

626
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,557
I think she's right, you should
take his help. Go. - Yes, come on.

627
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,466
Oh no. - Her parents don't know
anything about it yet.

628
00:47:09,546 --> 00:47:12,071
Please Raja, help us. Please.

629
00:47:13,426 --> 00:47:14,380
Let's go.

630
00:47:14,723 --> 00:47:16,172
Wake up, give me the keys of the jeep.

631
00:47:16,342 --> 00:47:17,901
Gowda, I will send you photo
on Whatsapp.

632
00:47:17,981 --> 00:47:19,314
Send it to everyone.
- Okay. - Here's the key.

633
00:47:19,394 --> 00:47:21,721
Call me if you get any information.
Come on, let's go.

634
00:47:22,935 --> 00:47:24,360
Hello?

635
00:47:25,528 --> 00:47:27,304
Tell the guys to check
all the railway stations.

636
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:29,126
I've sent you the picture on Whatsapp.

637
00:47:32,796 --> 00:47:34,081
Tell them to check bus stops.

638
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:36,674
Don't let any private bus pass by.
Check every bus.

639
00:47:37,656 --> 00:47:39,221
Did you check everywhere?

640
00:47:39,525 --> 00:47:41,207
We didn't find the girl
in Cantonment Railway Station.

641
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:43,521
She's not in Majestic too.
- Not in Yeshwanthpur too.

642
00:47:43,601 --> 00:47:46,242
Oh no! - Buddy, everyone
is looking for them in the area.

643
00:47:47,644 --> 00:47:48,824
Hi, Raja. What brings you here?

644
00:47:48,904 --> 00:47:50,284
One of my friends has gone missing.

645
00:47:50,364 --> 00:47:52,495
If you have her photo, send it to me.
- Sure, right away, sir.

646
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,868
Hello, control room.

647
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:57,714
Do you have anybody's number?
- No.

648
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:03,543
Hello? - Raja, the girl's picture
that you sent me on Whatsapp,

649
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:05,412
she is here.
- Where?

650
00:48:05,492 --> 00:48:07,117
Kengeri Railway Station.

651
00:48:07,197 --> 00:48:08,987
Chaitra is at Kengeri Railway Station.

652
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:15,518
Come on, run!

653
00:48:20,776 --> 00:48:22,528
Hey, leave me.
- Leave him!

654
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,152
Leave him.

655
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,820
Raja, don't interfere in this matter.

656
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,544
This is my personal matter.

657
00:48:29,862 --> 00:48:31,593
What is your personal matter?

658
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:34,245
If you love someone,
you should face the world bravely.

659
00:48:34,759 --> 00:48:36,242
You shouldn't run away like this.

660
00:48:36,322 --> 00:48:38,416
I tried to convince my parents,
but they didn't agree.

661
00:48:38,496 --> 00:48:39,685
What else do you expect me to do?

662
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:43,146
Do you expect them to accept her
with open arms?

663
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:46,908
They've brought her up for 20 years,
they can't let her go

664
00:48:47,095 --> 00:48:49,829
with any stranger she likes.
- Raja, leave us alone.

665
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:52,539
This is the matter of my life.
- Which life are you talking about?

666
00:48:53,712 --> 00:48:56,441
If you run away,
your parents will have to

667
00:48:56,521 --> 00:48:59,747
face the society with humiliation.
Is that you want in your life?

668
00:49:03,158 --> 00:49:06,815
All the parents sleep peacefully
because they trust their children.

669
00:49:07,457 --> 00:49:10,681
They don't lock the door
and keep the key under their pillows.

670
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,300
Don't break their trust.

671
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,753
Raja, I love her very sincerely.

672
00:49:20,155 --> 00:49:22,316
Hey, look into history,

673
00:49:22,538 --> 00:49:25,984
everyone worships parents, not lovers.

674
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:33,086
Have you ever thought what your parents
will go through after you run away?

675
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,514
You won't know the value of parents
until they are alive.

676
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:41,662
You'll know only when they are no more.

677
00:49:43,776 --> 00:49:46,498
You wait for months to get a reply
from your girlfriend.

678
00:49:46,578 --> 00:49:50,132
Can't you wait for her parents' consent?

679
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:56,745
Look, it's not wrong to fall in love,
but you should have some ethics.

680
00:49:59,093 --> 00:50:01,137
Anwar, listen to me.

681
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:06,721
Chaitra, I take the responsibility
of convincing your parents.

682
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:18,087
Sorry Raja,
I will wait for her for years.

683
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:35,697
Bye, sister.
- Bye.

684
00:50:36,452 --> 00:50:41,195
Raja, do you love your parents so much?

685
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,643
Aren't they with you?

686
00:50:59,197 --> 00:51:00,544
Thank you, Raja.

687
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,955
Geeta, did you find Chaitra?

688
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:15,062
Yes, mom.
- Why are you looking so sullen?

689
00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:17,831
You made a grave mistake.
- What has she done?

690
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:20,915
Aunt, Raja liked her very much.

691
00:51:21,096 --> 00:51:25,518
But she didn't realize that
and hurt him badly.

692
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:29,092
But he doesn't have anything in mind.

693
00:51:29,408 --> 00:51:32,784
He came to our help in the
middle of the night when we called him.

694
00:51:33,018 --> 00:51:36,336
Geeta, you'll find many guys
who has status,

695
00:51:36,605 --> 00:51:40,016
but guys who value their parents
are rare to find.

696
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:44,549
If you miss a guy like him,
there's no bigger fool than you.

697
00:51:45,518 --> 00:51:49,409
Geeta, tell me, if you don't like him,

698
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:53,872
I am free,
I will try to entice him from tomorrow.

699
00:51:53,952 --> 00:51:56,418
Hey, I love him, Mom.

700
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,963
I am so happy.
- What's the matter?

701
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:05,940
We found our son-in-law.
- Is it? Congratulations.

702
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:07,354
When should I book the wedding hall?

703
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:10,987
"The girl..."
- Buddy, where have you been?

704
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:15,450
I went to Mysore to paint the Tiger's nails
which was brought from Africa.

705
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:20,953
You idiot! Get lost from here! Go away!

706
00:52:21,385 --> 00:52:22,499
Why is everyone sleeping?

707
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:24,399
Chikka, you are drunk
at such early hour of the morning.

708
00:52:24,479 --> 00:52:26,774
What do you think of yourself?

709
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:30,391
Hey! - You show respect
to the one who insulted?

710
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:36,208
Me? - She hit you with sandals
in the coffee day, didn't you feel ashamed?

711
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:39,222
Chikka, you're talking too much.
- Yesterday she called you

712
00:52:39,302 --> 00:52:41,337
and said that someone has eloped.

713
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,428
Why did you go to help her?

714
00:52:43,508 --> 00:52:46,676
Hey!
- Today she called again and said, 'Raja,'

715
00:52:46,756 --> 00:52:50,438
'my cook has not come',
you go and cook food for her.

716
00:52:50,594 --> 00:52:54,912
Hey, tomorrow she will make you
do all the household chores.

717
00:52:54,992 --> 00:52:56,910
She will fire all the servants

718
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:59,678
and hire you to do household chores.
Am I right, Raja?

719
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,921
My God!

720
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:04,083
Chikka has fallen unconscious,
bring water.

721
00:53:04,163 --> 00:53:05,929
Quick. Come on.

722
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:08,861
Chikka, what happened?
I will get you liquor, get up.

723
00:53:09,842 --> 00:53:11,349
I told you he will get up.

724
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:15,730
Are you all right? Are you okay?

725
00:53:18,814 --> 00:53:21,022
Raja, when did you come?

726
00:53:21,168 --> 00:53:22,219
Did you meet Chaitra?

727
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,620
You went alone yesterday,
had you called me I would've come along.

728
00:53:25,392 --> 00:53:26,670
How is Geeta?

729
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:30,123
I will go to the gym.
I need to work on my thighs.

730
00:53:30,203 --> 00:53:33,592
You are really shameless.
- Who said that?

731
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:36,026
I said it.
- No, I am familiar with your voice.

732
00:53:36,106 --> 00:53:39,492
Who insulted me?
Come and fight me. - Idiot.

733
00:53:42,765 --> 00:53:45,333
Mulhandi, the manager
of Raj Group of Companies.

734
00:53:45,413 --> 00:53:48,370
Oti Ketta, the wastrel with Raj.

735
00:53:48,722 --> 00:53:51,233
You haven't changed at you.
- You too.

736
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:53,792
Same tie.
- Same body.

737
00:53:53,872 --> 00:53:55,754
Same shirt.
- Same pant.

738
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:58,337
I am also wearing the same underwear.
Do you want to see?

739
00:53:58,465 --> 00:54:00,479
This is what happens if meat sellers
in Kalasipalya wear tie

740
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,286
and come on two wheeler.

741
00:54:02,366 --> 00:54:04,026
Clear the garbage.

742
00:54:05,697 --> 00:54:07,099
Sir.
- Vijay.

743
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:09,097
How are you?
- I am fine. How are you?

744
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:12,064
I am fine. Uncle has asked you to come
to the registrar office tomorrow.

745
00:54:15,954 --> 00:54:17,449
Okay, I will come.

746
00:54:21,117 --> 00:54:22,472
Hello.
- Hello, Raja.

747
00:54:22,552 --> 00:54:24,680
Hi, Rani.
- Hey, this is Geeta.

748
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,725
Sorry.
- Where is Raja?

749
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,517
He has gone to registration office
leaving his phone behind.

750
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:31,865
Oh. Okay, I will go there.

751
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:44,692
Satyaraj, how are you?
- Greetings.

752
00:54:44,772 --> 00:54:46,958
Please wait for 10 minutes,
I will send for you. - Okay.

753
00:54:55,686 --> 00:54:58,186
Brother, do you require
my and Lavanya's signature?

754
00:54:58,266 --> 00:54:59,576
Yes.
- How long will it take?

755
00:54:59,656 --> 00:55:01,503
Sister, wait in the car

756
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,875
I will call you once it's done.
- Lavanya.

757
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:12,088
Father, brother is standing alone.

758
00:55:12,259 --> 00:55:15,020
Please call him.
- No, my dear.

759
00:55:15,172 --> 00:55:18,338
I will go and talk to him.
- No, my dear.

760
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:20,406
There will be unnecessary commotion,
please don't.

761
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:23,259
I feel pained seeing brother.

762
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:31,212
Why has she come here?

763
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:35,126
Sir, please come.
- Okay.

764
00:55:35,324 --> 00:55:37,976
Raja, please come.

765
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:40,734
Hello, why did you come here?
- I want to meet Raja.

766
00:55:40,814 --> 00:55:43,806
You can't meet him, his mother has come.
- Mother? - Yes.

767
00:55:45,464 --> 00:55:47,685
The lady getting down from BMW car

768
00:55:47,765 --> 00:55:51,166
she's Anjana Devi, she's Raja's mother

769
00:55:51,469 --> 00:55:53,572
she's the owner of
Raj Group and Companies.

770
00:55:58,128 --> 00:55:59,659
Do you know why she has come here?

771
00:55:59,846 --> 00:56:03,175
She's here to donate her property worth
18 crores to the temple

772
00:56:03,255 --> 00:56:06,341
she, her family and Raja
have come here for registration.

773
00:56:09,145 --> 00:56:12,101
You were boasting about status that day

774
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:14,519
this is our Raja's status.

775
00:56:14,693 --> 00:56:16,937
Do you understand? Please leave.

776
00:56:22,264 --> 00:56:23,421
Raja!

777
00:56:44,203 --> 00:56:47,066
I lost property worth
18 crores because of him

778
00:56:47,146 --> 00:56:48,830
where is that old man?

779
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,217
Bhirava, you can't enter
the temple wearing slippers.

780
00:56:56,551 --> 00:57:01,189
How dare you bring those
who left the town to revolt against me?

781
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,582
No matter who comes,
they can never overpower me.

782
00:57:07,054 --> 00:57:10,465
This is harassment,
isn't there anyone to stop this?

783
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:12,837
Rs 10,000, take it.

784
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:14,928
Hi, Raja.
- Hi.

785
00:57:15,535 --> 00:57:17,720
Look into the balance money,
I will see you later.

786
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,309
How are you?

787
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:24,239
Raja, you saved my life from getting ruined
and made me understand what love is.

788
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,135
I want to tell you something.

789
00:57:27,215 --> 00:57:30,254
Tell me.
- Geeta loves you very much.

790
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,946
Really? - When she came to the registrar
office to profess her love to you

791
00:57:34,026 --> 00:57:36,762
she got to know everything about you.

792
00:57:36,947 --> 00:57:40,489
She felt guilty and left quietly.

793
00:57:41,297 --> 00:57:43,911
She asked us not to tell anybody
about it

794
00:57:43,991 --> 00:57:45,612
but I am still telling you.

795
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,230
She loves you very much.

796
00:57:55,901 --> 00:57:57,206
Geeta!

797
00:57:57,286 --> 00:57:59,893
I waited for three years
thinking he would propose to me

798
00:57:59,973 --> 00:58:02,148
but finally, I had to muster courage.

799
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,835
Ours is love marriage. Bye.

800
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,650
Hello. Who are you?
- Do something. Bye.

801
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:15,068
Sister Geeta! - You called me sister?
- Pay heed to my advice.

802
00:58:15,148 --> 00:58:17,085
What is it? - Read the message
behind my auto rickshaw.

803
00:58:17,165 --> 00:58:18,078
What?

804
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:23,748
'Hard earned money and the boy you love'

805
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:26,411
'never lose them.'

806
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:29,741
You look so beautiful.

807
00:58:29,821 --> 00:58:31,481
Take it.
- What is this?

808
00:58:31,561 --> 00:58:33,250
Open it.

809
00:58:37,766 --> 00:58:42,871
Who gave it?
- A handsome boy gave it to me.

810
00:58:44,391 --> 00:58:46,085
Look, he is there.

811
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:04,962
My family may be rich

812
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,539
but my wealth is my mother.

813
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:14,731
I swear by my mother,
I will protect you until my last breath.

814
01:00:36,541 --> 01:00:40,305
Greetings. I am Narayan, software engineer.
- I am Raja, hardware engineer.

815
01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:42,079
I like hardware.
- I like software.

816
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:44,636
My dear! I like him!

817
01:00:45,373 --> 01:00:46,811
Sorry.

818
01:00:54,228 --> 01:00:55,712
Mr. Hardware.
- Uncle.

819
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:58,668
You are touching my legs.

820
01:00:59,182 --> 01:01:00,217
Sorry.

821
01:02:58,878 --> 01:03:01,309
Stop! Take reverse!

822
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:11,764
The owner of the theatre said
he had come in white jeep, right? - Yes.

823
01:03:13,681 --> 01:03:15,084
Cheers!

824
01:03:20,117 --> 01:03:23,715
Mano, the one wearing
blue checked shirt.

825
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:25,888
No, boss.
- What...

826
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,271
Hey! Get up!

827
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:36,310
Which area do you come from?
What is your name?

828
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,203
Do you often visit the bar?

829
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,609
Why is he quiet?

830
01:03:42,058 --> 01:03:46,100
Do you want to offer prayers to God
for me?

831
01:03:50,913 --> 01:03:53,880
Who is that?
- Sir, police station.

832
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,668
There's brawl in Millennium Bar.

833
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:59,336
Sir, he thrashed our men only
because they enquired about him.

834
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:00,691
How did you spare him?

835
01:04:00,771 --> 01:04:04,255
Sir, we gave up fearing the brawl
would worsen.

836
01:04:04,335 --> 01:04:06,100
Idiot. Hang up the phone.

837
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:13,623
We are going to our hometown
after ten years.

838
01:04:14,172 --> 01:04:16,754
Let's take Raja along.
- But sister-in-law should agree for it.

839
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:18,693
He is the heir of our family

840
01:04:18,928 --> 01:04:21,965
he can't be absent for the
veneration of our deity. - Okay.

841
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:25,680
After going to our hometown,
I will talk to sister-in-law.

842
01:04:28,484 --> 01:04:29,629
Greetings, ma'am.

843
01:04:29,709 --> 01:04:32,468
Shobha, boil milk for the baby.
- Okay.

844
01:04:35,096 --> 01:04:36,954
Come, Lavanya. When did you come?

845
01:04:37,328 --> 01:04:38,520
Aunt...

846
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:42,342
I swear by my child

847
01:04:42,422 --> 01:04:44,034
your son is innocent.

848
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:55,074
I am responsible for him
to leave the house.

849
01:04:55,869 --> 01:05:00,156
He is facing punishment because
of the mistake I did that day.

850
01:05:00,332 --> 01:05:03,673
I am responsible for everything,
please forgive me.

851
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,665
There was a brawl here last night,
who is that boy?

852
01:05:24,745 --> 01:05:26,686
I know he comes here regularly.

853
01:05:26,766 --> 01:05:29,092
Who is he? Where does he live?

854
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:31,499
I think they are from Bazaar.
- I see.

855
01:05:32,551 --> 01:05:33,859
Okay.

856
01:05:39,911 --> 01:05:43,416
Tell me, Suri.
- Boss, he is from Bazaar.

857
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,706
Don't spare him! Finish him!

858
01:05:45,786 --> 01:05:47,470
Okay, boss. Let's go.

859
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:51,314
Greetings.
- Greetings.

860
01:05:51,512 --> 01:05:54,994
Why did you take the trouble?
- We respect you.

861
01:05:56,617 --> 01:06:02,622
Look Satyaraj, we have decided that
you will be the trustee of this temple.

862
01:06:07,366 --> 01:06:12,740
If you sign these papers,
the formalities will be over.

863
01:06:13,289 --> 01:06:14,749
Greetings to all of you.

864
01:06:29,549 --> 01:06:32,096
You boast because you are in power.

865
01:06:32,493 --> 01:06:34,117
Father... Oh, my God!
- Why are you beating him?

866
01:06:34,197 --> 01:06:36,383
How dare you?
- Let go! - Hey!

867
01:06:36,463 --> 01:06:38,802
Oh, my God!
Sir! - What happened? Let go!

868
01:06:38,882 --> 01:06:41,232
Let go of him!
- Let go of him!

869
01:06:41,593 --> 01:06:44,135
Uncle!
- What are you waiting for?

870
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,410
Hey! They are dignified people.

871
01:06:49,947 --> 01:06:51,991
You must not misbehave with them,
let's go.

872
01:07:03,942 --> 01:07:07,844
He hit with slipper in the temple
in front of people that day

873
01:07:08,135 --> 01:07:12,751
today, he had his man slap Satyaraj
and put him to shame.

874
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:18,090
There is nobody to fight against him.

875
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:21,091
He should be given a befitting reply.

876
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:23,872
There will be someone
to fight against him.

877
01:07:23,952 --> 01:07:28,323
We must bring him
and have him deal with him.

878
01:07:29,596 --> 01:07:31,146
If we bring a hooligan to fight him,

879
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:33,078
there will be no difference
between us and him.

880
01:07:33,158 --> 01:07:35,052
Let's complain to the police.

881
01:07:36,629 --> 01:07:41,150
It is futile to complain to the police
against those goons

882
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,077
we must give him a befitting reply.

883
01:07:43,615 --> 01:07:46,827
If the enemies find out
that the king has gone on an exile

884
01:07:46,907 --> 01:07:49,479
they will become fearless

885
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:53,054
and try to overpower the kingdom.

886
01:07:54,117 --> 01:07:56,243
Had the king been in his kingdom

887
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:59,642
would anyone dare to harm his family?

888
01:08:00,565 --> 01:08:05,834
If brother was here,
he would've thrashed the enemies to pulp.

889
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,758
If brother was here,
he would've killed the one who hit father.

890
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:12,899
Mom, brother should've been here,
ask him to come.

891
01:08:32,806 --> 01:08:36,044
Mom, please don't hit me!
- How dare you?

892
01:08:36,124 --> 01:08:38,133
I didn't do anything.
- How dare you?

893
01:08:38,213 --> 01:08:39,722
What did you steal?
- Ma'am.

894
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:42,678
Hit him only after you find out
whether he has made mistake or not.

895
01:08:47,584 --> 01:08:48,943
Hello.

896
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,916
Hello?

897
01:08:54,932 --> 01:08:56,261
Mom?

898
01:08:59,349 --> 01:09:02,050
Mom?
- Come to our hometown.

899
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:06,917
Come to our hometown.
- I will come.

900
01:09:20,236 --> 01:09:22,407
Where is Raja?
- Ask him.

901
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:24,884
Where is Raja?
- He is not here. - What's the matter?

902
01:09:24,964 --> 01:09:27,653
I want loan.
Where is he? - He is out of town.

903
01:09:28,762 --> 01:09:31,239
Where has he gone?
- Kottnahalli. - Kottnahalli.

904
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:33,201
Boss, he is from Kottnahalli.

905
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:35,293
Kottnahalli? He hails from our town?

906
01:09:35,373 --> 01:09:37,909
Yes.
- Come, bring our men along.

907
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:41,298
Right away.
- What are you waiting for?

908
01:09:41,823 --> 01:09:44,066
Keep the coffee there?
Will you keep it here?

909
01:09:45,117 --> 01:09:46,437
Leave!

910
01:10:19,076 --> 01:10:20,879
Who hit uncle?

911
01:10:23,413 --> 01:10:24,851
Who hit uncle?

912
01:10:42,324 --> 01:10:46,474
The one who hit your uncle,
break his hand.

913
01:10:56,906 --> 01:10:58,869
It's your mother's order

914
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:01,740
break his hand.

915
01:11:35,206 --> 01:11:37,344
Hey! Who are you?

916
01:12:28,465 --> 01:12:31,667
Brother, he is the one who hit father,
don't spare him.

917
01:13:38,172 --> 01:13:39,552
Brother!

918
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:45,918
Hey!
- Don't scream!

919
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:51,526
You screamed just once
and you have come to this state

920
01:14:53,711 --> 01:14:55,547
if you scream again

921
01:14:56,654 --> 01:14:59,318
you will be put to shame completely.

922
01:15:01,362 --> 01:15:04,726
Greatness doesn't lie in losing dignity

923
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:10,742
greatness lies in protecting dignity.

924
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:15,907
Millions of people
pay their respects to us

925
01:15:15,987 --> 01:15:21,564
so understand the power
and the history of our family.

926
01:15:23,709 --> 01:15:27,623
You need ability to
even stand in front of us

927
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:32,740
you need to have the capacity
to even lock horns with us.

928
01:15:34,318 --> 01:15:37,251
Just because the lion is quiet,
don't try to fiddle it,

929
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:38,816
this was just a roar

930
01:15:40,462 --> 01:15:42,869
let there be fear in you.

931
01:15:47,297 --> 01:15:50,405
He is my son Raj.

932
01:15:51,468 --> 01:15:52,629
Viraj!

933
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,987
He is the one who saved SP
in the theatre.

934
01:15:59,201 --> 01:16:03,302
He has now put you to shame in your
own town, he is not an ordinary man.

935
01:16:06,643 --> 01:16:09,119
What? Drink it.

936
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:27,216
Raja, you saved the dignity
of our family.

937
01:16:27,835 --> 01:16:30,639
Don't leave this house,
please stay here.

938
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:37,671
I will take your leave, uncle.
- Raja.

939
01:16:38,618 --> 01:16:40,744
Brother...
- Raja... - Bye, aunt. - Please...

940
01:16:40,824 --> 01:16:42,860
Please don't go, brother.

941
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:45,253
Please don't go.

942
01:16:45,428 --> 01:16:47,111
Please stay here.

943
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:49,682
Son...

944
01:16:51,936 --> 01:16:53,747
Don't leave your mother and go.

945
01:16:54,798 --> 01:16:56,936
Only I know the pain

946
01:16:57,731 --> 01:17:02,205
I went through staying away from you
for three years.

947
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:05,021
If you go away again

948
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,249
I won't be able to take it.

949
01:17:10,429 --> 01:17:12,263
I punished you

950
01:17:13,455 --> 01:17:18,280
for the mistake that you had not done.
Please forgive me.

951
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:22,030
Raja, you are the brightness
of this house

952
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,576
if you go away,
there will be only darkness.

953
01:17:24,833 --> 01:17:28,291
Please stay with us, Raja.
- Yes, brother. - I won't go anywhere.

954
01:17:28,852 --> 01:17:30,639
I will stay with you.

955
01:17:30,978 --> 01:17:32,210
Raja.

956
01:17:33,992 --> 01:17:35,616
I will stay with you.

957
01:17:50,836 --> 01:17:54,680
Ma'am, you came to the town
so thank you very much

958
01:17:55,567 --> 01:17:59,562
but we didn't stand by you
during difficulties

959
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,982
but the show must go on.

960
01:18:05,368 --> 01:18:07,000
We have brought the papers

961
01:18:07,369 --> 01:18:09,501
if Satyaraj signs them...
- No, uncle.

962
01:18:10,026 --> 01:18:11,090
Why, Satyaraj?

963
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:14,971
Our brother Mutturaj
was the dignity of our family

964
01:18:16,641 --> 01:18:21,384
only Raja has his qualities in him.

965
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,512
He is the heir of our family.

966
01:18:27,342 --> 01:18:30,426
He is the perfect choice
for the position of the trustee.

967
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:39,843
Raja is the power who destroys
our enemy Bhirava.

968
01:18:41,385 --> 01:18:43,713
He is the symbol of affection

969
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,197
he has the courage
to put an end to arrogance

970
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:50,240
the person with such great qualities

971
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:52,985
becomes the trustee of our temple

972
01:18:53,207 --> 01:18:55,000
we will be very fortunate.

973
01:18:55,431 --> 01:19:00,736
Yes!

974
01:19:00,985 --> 01:19:04,888
No enemy would dare to attack us
if we have a protector.

975
01:19:06,431 --> 01:19:10,238
Raja is equal to an army.

976
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:29,585
As you please my son
will become the trustee.

977
01:19:36,068 --> 01:19:39,608
Then why delay? I have brought
the papers let him sign them.

978
01:19:39,688 --> 01:19:45,671
The culture shouldn't change
because of us.

979
01:19:46,777 --> 01:19:49,783
We are not so great for the veneration
to take place in our house.

980
01:19:50,251 --> 01:19:54,632
Fix an auspicious day yourself and
let the ritual take place in the temple.

981
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,164
Okay.

982
01:19:57,319 --> 01:19:59,270
Shall we schedule the veneration
on the day of the festival?

983
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:00,818
Okay.

984
01:20:09,994 --> 01:20:13,898
Driver, we are unable to hear the song

985
01:20:13,978 --> 01:20:16,489
increase the volume.
- Increase the volume.

986
01:20:17,049 --> 01:20:20,858
"Shake it."
- Sitting on the bus

987
01:20:20,938 --> 01:20:23,183
it feels like I am sitting
on an Elephant. Don't you feel so?

988
01:20:23,263 --> 01:20:24,958
But there's a small change.
- What's that?

989
01:20:25,038 --> 01:20:26,687
Usually, the throne
will be on the Elephant

990
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:28,311
but here, the Elephant is on the throne.

991
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:30,262
"Shake it."
- Ticket!

992
01:20:30,484 --> 01:20:32,400
"We the people..."
- Ticket!

993
01:20:32,603 --> 01:20:35,927
Ticket! - Being a conductor, you get into
a running bus, don't you feel ashamed?

994
01:20:36,007 --> 01:20:36,879
Don't you feel ashamed?

995
01:20:36,959 --> 01:20:39,514
You look like my uncle's
second wife's son

996
01:20:39,594 --> 01:20:41,732
if you die trying to sell ticket to us

997
01:20:41,812 --> 01:20:43,262
who will look after your family?

998
01:20:43,342 --> 01:20:45,027
We don't know your address.
- That's right.

999
01:20:45,107 --> 01:20:47,795
The driver will look after my family

1000
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:49,384
buy ticket first.

1001
01:20:49,464 --> 01:20:53,040
So, your wife has two men
to look after her, enjoy.

1002
01:20:53,297 --> 01:20:54,769
Okay. Give me two half tickets
to Kottnahalli.

1003
01:20:54,849 --> 01:20:57,854
Both of you are adults

1004
01:20:57,934 --> 01:20:59,792
you have to buy full ticket.

1005
01:20:59,872 --> 01:21:03,392
I will thrash you. May you be ruined.

1006
01:21:03,472 --> 01:21:05,481
Don't talk rubbish.
Don't you have manners?

1007
01:21:05,561 --> 01:21:08,203
You charge same amount of money to the
passengers sitting inside and watching film

1008
01:21:08,283 --> 01:21:10,247
and same amount to those
sitting on the rooftop?

1009
01:21:10,327 --> 01:21:13,192
Charge us half the price.
- Will you buy ticket or will you get down?

1010
01:21:13,272 --> 01:21:15,554
What did you say?
- Will you buy ticket or will you get down?

1011
01:21:15,634 --> 01:21:18,251
How dare you say that?

1012
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:21,288
Do you know who I am?
- I don't care who you are.

1013
01:21:21,368 --> 01:21:24,898
I am the Tiger who has
escaped from the forest.

1014
01:21:25,879 --> 01:21:27,339
Chikka, what are you saying?

1015
01:21:27,419 --> 01:21:29,220
That's what people call me in my town.

1016
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:33,134
If you have the guts...
- Chikka, duck!

1017
01:21:34,278 --> 01:21:36,908
Oh, my God!
- Chikka!

1018
01:21:36,988 --> 01:21:40,096
What have you done?
Come fast, I will fall down.

1019
01:21:40,176 --> 01:21:42,187
You fatso, rescue me quickly.

1020
01:21:42,267 --> 01:21:46,194
Chikka, if luck is not in your favour,
you will have to face the consequences.

1021
01:21:46,274 --> 01:21:48,496
Idiot. Stop commenting and save me.

1022
01:21:48,576 --> 01:21:50,563
If I come down,
I will beat you to death. - No!

1023
01:21:50,643 --> 01:21:52,269
I will do something.
- Quick!

1024
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:55,237
Chikka, there's a bus coming,
don't worry

1025
01:21:55,317 --> 01:21:57,608
close your eyes and jump over it.

1026
01:21:57,688 --> 01:22:01,537
What if I become an impotent
trying to jump?

1027
01:22:01,617 --> 01:22:04,221
Why do you worry?
I will help you.

1028
01:22:04,301 --> 01:22:05,868
You idiot.

1029
01:22:05,948 --> 01:22:09,280
Chikka, the bus is coming,
jump, come on.

1030
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:13,007
I found a loin cloth for the festival.
- You idiot.

1031
01:22:13,087 --> 01:22:15,553
He took away my only loin cloth I had.

1032
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:17,832
May you be ruined.

1033
01:22:17,912 --> 01:22:19,877
You idiot.
- Chikka.

1034
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:22,587
You can't get scared
and remain on the tree.

1035
01:22:23,592 --> 01:22:25,426
There's a death procession coming.

1036
01:22:25,506 --> 01:22:27,458
Don't let go the chance, please jump.

1037
01:22:27,538 --> 01:22:28,954
I will meet you at the bus station.

1038
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:32,494
How will I come? Fatso, come here.

1039
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:41,081
Oh, my God! - Ghost!
- I am not ghost.

1040
01:22:41,265 --> 01:22:43,779
I am alive.
- I will thrash you.

1041
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:46,127
Then why are you pretending to be dead?

1042
01:22:46,207 --> 01:22:48,173
It's a big story.

1043
01:22:48,253 --> 01:22:51,727
My sons and my daughters-in-law
mixed poison in my food

1044
01:22:51,807 --> 01:22:53,919
hence I am pretending to be dead.

1045
01:22:53,999 --> 01:22:55,461
I myself will kill you.

1046
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:58,066
Your family is crying for you

1047
01:22:58,146 --> 01:23:02,584
why do you put false allegations on them?
- They are pretending to grieve.

1048
01:23:02,664 --> 01:23:04,842
Listen to them.

1049
01:23:04,922 --> 01:23:06,524
Really?
- Yes.

1050
01:23:06,734 --> 01:23:08,521
You take four acres of land

1051
01:23:08,601 --> 01:23:11,290
and I will take five acres of land.

1052
01:23:13,065 --> 01:23:15,834
You take the pearl necklace.

1053
01:23:16,488 --> 01:23:19,000
You take the gold necklace.

1054
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,313
You... - Did you hear them?

1055
01:23:21,757 --> 01:23:23,755
This is how you divide property?
- Yes.

1056
01:23:23,835 --> 01:23:26,383
Look, I will give away my wealth to you

1057
01:23:26,463 --> 01:23:28,427
please save me.

1058
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:30,238
Wait a minute.

1059
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:35,134
Jump!

1060
01:23:42,996 --> 01:23:45,508
Oh, my God!
Stop! Don't you want my wealth?

1061
01:23:45,588 --> 01:23:48,920
I don't want your wealth, give me your
loin cloth. Let's go. - My loin cloth.

1062
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,410
Okay.

1063
01:23:50,753 --> 01:23:54,817
Darling, if the two of us...

1064
01:23:55,554 --> 01:23:57,365
Oh, my God! Sir is coming!

1065
01:23:58,102 --> 01:23:59,831
Putaraju.
- Good morning, sir.

1066
01:23:59,911 --> 01:24:01,458
I told you clean the house
before we come

1067
01:24:01,538 --> 01:24:03,008
but you are coming two days
after we arrived.

1068
01:24:03,088 --> 01:24:06,303
Where have you been?
- Well...I had been to the village.

1069
01:24:06,383 --> 01:24:08,781
What for?
- To romance, sorry, for harvest.

1070
01:24:08,861 --> 01:24:10,638
You should've done that
after cleaning the house.

1071
01:24:10,718 --> 01:24:12,402
I cleaned the house that day.
- No, you didn't.

1072
01:24:12,482 --> 01:24:15,182
I actually cleaned the other house.
- Which house?

1073
01:24:15,262 --> 01:24:17,495
My mistress's house.
- Mistress's house?

1074
01:24:17,575 --> 01:24:19,422
What are you saying?
- You don't understand.

1075
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:23,231
This is the fate of men
who have two phones and two houses.

1076
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:26,105
They forget their numbers
and hold others responsible.

1077
01:24:26,185 --> 01:24:28,570
You must understand.
- Don't try to fool me. Putaraju.

1078
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:31,491
I have landed him in trouble,
he's finished.

1079
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:35,404
What is he saying?
- Don't listen to him, go inside.

1080
01:24:37,612 --> 01:24:40,100
Stop! Oh, my God!

1081
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:43,185
You idiot! Are you crazy?

1082
01:24:43,265 --> 01:24:45,907
You should apply brakes slowly.

1083
01:24:45,987 --> 01:24:49,225
"Who is she?'

1084
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:52,192
What are you doing?
- I am reading the headlines.

1085
01:24:52,272 --> 01:24:53,746
I will gouge out your eyes.

1086
01:24:53,826 --> 01:24:55,697
What's your problem?
- What did you say?

1087
01:24:56,001 --> 01:24:58,617
You idiot!
She is your brother's wife to be.

1088
01:24:58,697 --> 01:25:00,451
Who is my brother.
- I am your brother.

1089
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:04,517
It's me.
- It was in the past.

1090
01:25:04,692 --> 01:25:06,946
She now belongs to me.

1091
01:25:07,026 --> 01:25:08,769
It was I who wooed her first.

1092
01:25:08,849 --> 01:25:13,570
It is not important
as to who woos her first

1093
01:25:13,839 --> 01:25:15,778
what matters is whom she will love

1094
01:25:15,965 --> 01:25:17,823
and she loves me.

1095
01:25:17,903 --> 01:25:19,563
Let's see.
- Shut up.

1096
01:25:19,643 --> 01:25:21,187
What's your problem?
- What's your problem?

1097
01:25:21,267 --> 01:25:24,283
I will beat you to death, don't mess...
- They are fighting

1098
01:25:24,363 --> 01:25:27,041
now I will cast my spell on her.

1099
01:25:29,354 --> 01:25:32,975
My phone is ringing, I will show you
the video later, go and play. Okay?

1100
01:25:33,457 --> 01:25:38,244
Hi, Geeta. - You forgot your girlfriend
after going to your mother.

1101
01:25:38,324 --> 01:25:40,558
Not at all, I was about to call you.

1102
01:25:40,638 --> 01:25:43,957
I have become restless
without seeing you.

1103
01:25:44,037 --> 01:25:46,296
I miss you so much.
- All right.

1104
01:25:46,376 --> 01:25:48,993
I will come and meet you at the earliest.
- No.

1105
01:25:49,073 --> 01:25:51,668
I can't wait, I am already in your town.

1106
01:25:51,748 --> 01:25:54,483
In our town? Where?
- I am serious.

1107
01:25:54,563 --> 01:25:57,322
Look, just 5 kilometers to go,
I will be there.

1108
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:00,511
Stay where you are, I will come.
- Raja.

1109
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:09,880
Stop! Oh God!
I myself would've come. - Hi, Raja.

1110
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,281
Why did you come here? The villagers
will see you, please go. - Don't worry.

1111
01:26:13,361 --> 01:26:15,557
Please go.
- Bike.

1112
01:26:16,119 --> 01:26:18,689
Nobody will see us if we go by bike.
Listen to me. Please. - Please don't.

1113
01:26:18,769 --> 01:26:20,920
Please come.
- Are you crazy?

1114
01:26:22,999 --> 01:26:24,424
People will see us
only if we go on bike.

1115
01:26:24,504 --> 01:26:29,132
Usually, boyfriends wish
to take their girlfriends on bike.

1116
01:26:29,541 --> 01:26:32,531
Is that so?
- You're weak in Biology.

1117
01:26:32,766 --> 01:26:35,638
You will know when you come
across potholes.

1118
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:39,145
Is that so? But why?

1119
01:26:50,033 --> 01:26:51,622
Did you now understand?

1120
01:30:14,391 --> 01:30:16,809
Geeta, didn't I tell you
not to meet me frequently?

1121
01:30:16,889 --> 01:30:18,971
I will come to the city and meet you.

1122
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,599
It's been two days
since you called or message.

1123
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:25,420
Do you think love is Facebook to log in
and log out at your convenience?

1124
01:30:25,659 --> 01:30:29,042
Don't try to fool me with these things.
Come on, speak up.

1125
01:30:29,122 --> 01:30:30,654
Hello, boss.
- Tell me.

1126
01:30:30,734 --> 01:30:32,908
Raja is at the bus stop.
- I am coming.

1127
01:30:34,007 --> 01:30:35,771
Stay there, I am coming.

1128
01:30:37,664 --> 01:30:40,316
If you do this,
I will come to your house and settle.

1129
01:30:40,503 --> 01:30:43,669
Then... hey, look at me.
Why aren't you saying anything?

1130
01:30:46,403 --> 01:30:49,242
I am talking to you. Come on, speak up.

1131
01:31:02,853 --> 01:31:05,715
Geeta, the bus stop is here.
You leave. Be careful.

1132
01:31:06,555 --> 01:31:07,642
Okay.

1133
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:10,971
Hello?
- Yes Geeta, tell me.

1134
01:31:11,051 --> 01:31:13,810
Swati, I'm coming in a bus
from Raja's village. - Why?

1135
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:16,076
Did Raja leave you in the midway?

1136
01:31:16,156 --> 01:31:18,295
No, you won't understand.

1137
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:19,849
You just come and pick me up.

1138
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,399
Boss.
- Where is he? - He was here.

1139
01:31:26,532 --> 01:31:30,236
Where did he go? - He will surely come,
he has parked his bike here.

1140
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:33,390
Sir, tea.
- Did anyone ask you for tea?

1141
01:31:33,470 --> 01:31:35,808
Sir, will you give me
your residence number? - Why?

1142
01:31:35,888 --> 01:31:37,859
You all will be lying on the floor
in the next five minutes.

1143
01:31:37,979 --> 01:31:40,107
I will have to call the ambulance.

1144
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:43,074
Hey you! Enough of your build-up!

1145
01:31:43,154 --> 01:31:44,955
Sir, do you want tea or not?

1146
01:31:45,656 --> 01:31:49,487
Mom!
- Thank you, sir.

1147
01:31:50,574 --> 01:31:54,078
Sir, he doesn't want to have tea.

1148
01:31:54,288 --> 01:31:57,711
They want to get thrashed by you.
Come out!

1149
01:32:20,223 --> 01:32:22,127
He'll teach you a lesson.
- Go!

1150
01:32:22,207 --> 01:32:24,685
What are you watching? Go!
- Go!

1151
01:32:27,139 --> 01:32:28,781
Haven't you reformed yet?

1152
01:32:32,069 --> 01:32:34,091
I am quitting the job right away.

1153
01:32:34,558 --> 01:32:35,831
Sorry, boss.

1154
01:32:36,976 --> 01:32:39,537
Share auto, wait I'm coming.
- Hey!

1155
01:32:39,617 --> 01:32:41,369
Hey, you go.

1156
01:32:45,715 --> 01:32:48,648
I think you have a commitment.
You must have taken a loan.

1157
01:32:49,711 --> 01:32:53,706
I can't help it. Your bad luck. Come on.
- Go!

1158
01:32:57,993 --> 01:33:01,007
Hey, go in a group of four and hit him!

1159
01:33:09,302 --> 01:33:10,976
What are you doing?

1160
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,213
We've been eating pain killers even today
for the thrashing he gave us the other day.

1161
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:17,841
If he hits us again,
we will die for sure.

1162
01:33:18,519 --> 01:33:20,505
Sir, please leave us. We'll sleep here.

1163
01:33:20,726 --> 01:33:21,806
Intelligent fellow.

1164
01:33:22,127 --> 01:33:25,368
Eunuchs! Come on, hit him!

1165
01:33:25,749 --> 01:33:30,083
I was talking about humor till now,
now you face the hammer.

1166
01:34:35,164 --> 01:34:36,449
Raja!

1167
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:47,804
Geeta, tell me.
- You said Raja left me in midway.

1168
01:34:48,002 --> 01:34:49,953
I've sent you a video on Whatsapp,
have a look.

1169
01:34:50,033 --> 01:34:51,233
I will see.

1170
01:35:15,619 --> 01:35:18,609
He deserves this.
- Yes.

1171
01:35:18,689 --> 01:35:21,705
He was acting too much.
- He really deserved it.

1172
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:25,759
Bhirava, how are you?

1173
01:35:26,063 --> 01:35:30,198
Hey, don't fuel the fire.

1174
01:35:30,278 --> 01:35:32,126
Why will I fuel the fire?

1175
01:35:32,206 --> 01:35:34,206
He not only thrashed you
before everyone,

1176
01:35:34,286 --> 01:35:37,489
but has humiliated you
before the entire village.

1177
01:35:38,633 --> 01:35:39,755
What are you saying?

1178
01:35:39,835 --> 01:35:43,715
He has uploaded the video on YouTube.
Look here.

1179
01:35:48,726 --> 01:35:52,371
4 lakh people have viewed it
and 1 lakh people have liked it.

1180
01:35:52,967 --> 01:35:55,549
Sir, who uploaded it on YouTube?
Sir is already tense.

1181
01:35:55,629 --> 01:35:57,056
Delete this first.

1182
01:35:57,136 --> 01:36:00,327
I think it must be a girl because she
has put the status as 'He's my hero'.

1183
01:36:00,407 --> 01:36:02,677
I will give you her IP address
and details.

1184
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:04,651
Go and get her.

1185
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:10,631
Uncle, did you call me?
- Raja, Bhirava is not a trustworthy man.

1186
01:36:10,923 --> 01:36:12,641
He's very unpredictable.

1187
01:36:12,721 --> 01:36:15,141
I fear to send women
and children out of the house.

1188
01:36:15,491 --> 01:36:19,440
Its better we lodge a police complaint.
- Okay, Uncle.

1189
01:36:47,899 --> 01:36:49,420
Isn't it you in the video?

1190
01:36:52,798 --> 01:36:55,198
Yes.
- Officer, arrest him.

1191
01:36:57,084 --> 01:36:58,266
Sir...

1192
01:37:00,563 --> 01:37:03,507
I was feeling very bad that I couldn't

1193
01:37:03,587 --> 01:37:06,662
thank the man who saved my life
risking his life.

1194
01:37:07,491 --> 01:37:11,568
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1195
01:37:14,897 --> 01:37:17,969
My wife lost her parents
when she was born.

1196
01:37:18,285 --> 01:37:21,556
Had she lost her husband,
she would've become an orphan again.

1197
01:37:22,386 --> 01:37:24,283
You saved her husband.

1198
01:37:25,108 --> 01:37:26,705
Thank you very much.

1199
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,715
Now, I will come to the matter.

1200
01:37:33,648 --> 01:37:36,464
What is the enmity
between you and Bhirava?

1201
01:37:50,354 --> 01:37:52,761
I will lodge a complaint in your name.

1202
01:37:53,065 --> 01:37:54,922
Akash.
- Yes, sir.

1203
01:38:00,728 --> 01:38:03,425
You need not fear Bhirava.

1204
01:38:04,548 --> 01:38:07,795
I can alert 100 policemen
for your security,

1205
01:38:08,625 --> 01:38:11,476
but Raja alone is equal to all of them.

1206
01:38:15,553 --> 01:38:20,210
No one has the guts to touch
a high-voltage transformer.

1207
01:38:23,568 --> 01:38:28,019
Ma'am, you've not given birth
to a normal guy.

1208
01:38:29,432 --> 01:38:34,561
You've given birth to a fearless,
ferocious lion.

1209
01:38:37,937 --> 01:38:39,432
I shall leave.

1210
01:38:52,119 --> 01:38:54,140
Brother, who is that girl?

1211
01:38:54,443 --> 01:38:57,376
She's put a status on YouTube saying,
'He's my hero'.

1212
01:38:57,808 --> 01:39:00,308
What's brewing between you both?
Is she your girlfriend?

1213
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:02,376
Hey, nothing like that.

1214
01:39:03,682 --> 01:39:05,717
Okay, carry on.

1215
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:12,457
Hi, Raja.
- Geeta.

1216
01:39:12,627 --> 01:39:14,688
Did you shoot a video when
I was hitting Bhirava? - Yes.

1217
01:39:14,768 --> 01:39:18,287
Why did you upload it on YouTube?
- Me? No way.

1218
01:39:18,626 --> 01:39:22,703
Oh wait, I had sent the video to Swati,
I think she's uploaded it.

1219
01:39:23,217 --> 01:39:25,215
One moment,
I will put you on a conference call.

1220
01:39:25,519 --> 01:39:28,393
But is everything alright?
- What alright?

1221
01:39:28,696 --> 01:39:30,752
16 lakh people have viewed
the uploaded video.

1222
01:39:31,184 --> 01:39:33,486
Okay, put me on the conference call.
- Okay.

1223
01:39:34,326 --> 01:39:36,897
Who did you ask before
uploading the video on YouTube?

1224
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:41,094
Sir, actually...
- Hello, Swati.

1225
01:39:41,277 --> 01:39:43,356
How dare you upload the video on YouTube

1226
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:46,896
and pretending before me. You!

1227
01:39:48,485 --> 01:39:50,343
Sir, it was not me.

1228
01:39:50,423 --> 01:39:52,819
My friend Geeta shot the video.

1229
01:39:53,847 --> 01:39:55,529
Raja, what do we do now?

1230
01:39:55,609 --> 01:39:57,726
You don't be in the house.
Take your parents and come to the market.

1231
01:39:57,806 --> 01:40:00,249
Market? - There's no safe place for you
other than that.

1232
01:40:00,329 --> 01:40:02,553
Get them. Fast.
- Okay.

1233
01:40:02,633 --> 01:40:05,285
Mom! - Sir, this girl uploaded
the video on YouTube.

1234
01:40:05,365 --> 01:40:07,259
But her friend Geeta shot the video.

1235
01:40:07,339 --> 01:40:09,894
Then catch hold of her first.
- Okay, sir.

1236
01:40:17,597 --> 01:40:18,733
Raja...

1237
01:40:21,394 --> 01:40:22,562
Raja!

1238
01:40:25,366 --> 01:40:27,177
I am here, don't worry.

1239
01:40:27,411 --> 01:40:29,172
I am scared.

1240
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:31,722
Thank you.
- Greetings, sir.

1241
01:40:31,802 --> 01:40:32,966
Thanks.

1242
01:40:34,163 --> 01:40:38,007
Sorry, because of my daughter,
you had to face all these problems.

1243
01:40:38,253 --> 01:40:40,870
No problem, sir. It's not safe for you
to be in Bangalore.

1244
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:43,977
If you come to my house, you'll be safe.

1245
01:40:44,199 --> 01:40:45,700
If you don't have any problem.

1246
01:40:47,026 --> 01:40:48,192
What do we do?

1247
01:40:50,519 --> 01:40:51,682
Come on.

1248
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:55,636
Gowda, I shall leave.
- Okay, Raja.

1249
01:40:57,657 --> 01:40:58,706
Raja.

1250
01:41:00,787 --> 01:41:02,972
I am scared.
- Don't be.

1251
01:41:23,316 --> 01:41:24,461
Uncle.
- 'Yes.'

1252
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:26,529
I'm getting Geeta and her parents' home.

1253
01:41:26,609 --> 01:41:27,931
Inform mom.
- 'Okay, son.'

1254
01:42:42,019 --> 01:42:46,937
Raja, you were punished
for my daughter's mistake.

1255
01:42:49,332 --> 01:42:51,890
I am a sinner who separated a son
from a mother.

1256
01:42:52,929 --> 01:42:56,329
Please forgive me.
- Uncle, what are you doing?

1257
01:42:57,404 --> 01:43:01,119
Everyone should have a son like you.

1258
01:43:52,578 --> 01:43:53,978
Bhirava.

1259
01:43:56,316 --> 01:43:57,884
Why did you come here?

1260
01:43:58,676 --> 01:44:00,402
I didn't come here to ask
about your well-being

1261
01:44:00,482 --> 01:44:02,895
and offer you apple juice
or Horlicks.

1262
01:44:03,793 --> 01:44:07,921
You attacked on someone two days ago.

1263
01:44:08,688 --> 01:44:11,515
What's your enmity with him?

1264
01:44:13,151 --> 01:44:14,857
How much money did he give you?

1265
01:44:15,324 --> 01:44:17,625
He thrashed me
in the middle of the road.

1266
01:44:17,705 --> 01:44:19,961
Everyone near the circle
has witnessed it.

1267
01:44:20,041 --> 01:44:22,450
20 lakh people have viewed it
on YouTube.

1268
01:44:24,109 --> 01:44:25,968
What did I ask for so many days?

1269
01:44:29,354 --> 01:44:32,625
Anyway Mr. Bhirava,
we'll meet very soon.

1270
01:44:34,331 --> 01:44:36,060
What did you say?

1271
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:39,179
You asked me how much he paid me, right?

1272
01:44:41,678 --> 01:44:43,454
He gave me his life.

1273
01:44:49,587 --> 01:44:53,337
If I don't kill someone
from Raja's family,

1274
01:44:53,747 --> 01:44:55,705
I don't deserve to be called as Bhirava.

1275
01:44:58,525 --> 01:45:01,539
Chikka, sir didn't call you.
- Is it?

1276
01:45:02,076 --> 01:45:04,997
We'll use the money
for the association...

1277
01:45:05,077 --> 01:45:06,644
Sir, hi.

1278
01:45:07,006 --> 01:45:08,618
Did you call me?
- No.

1279
01:45:08,698 --> 01:45:11,200
The money...
- Kari told me that you called me.

1280
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:14,109
Go away. Don't you have
any better work to do? Idiot!

1281
01:45:14,827 --> 01:45:16,220
You stay quiet.

1282
01:45:19,028 --> 01:45:20,968
You, Kari!

1283
01:45:21,715 --> 01:45:24,577
Sir didn't call me, why did you lie to me?
- When did I say he called you.

1284
01:45:24,657 --> 01:45:27,381
I said, he didn't call you.
- Why did you tell that to me?

1285
01:45:27,461 --> 01:45:28,573
Had he called who should I tell?
- Me.

1286
01:45:28,653 --> 01:45:30,945
If he didn't call, who should I tell?
- Me. - So, I told you.

1287
01:45:31,025 --> 01:45:32,347
You!

1288
01:45:32,427 --> 01:45:35,629
You idiot, if you don't have work to do,
wash Venkatalakshmi's skirt.

1289
01:45:35,709 --> 01:45:38,059
Wash Parimala's nighty,
madam Susheela's sari... - Hey.

1290
01:45:38,139 --> 01:45:42,732
Go wash her sari. Instead of doing that,
you want to do comedy with me.

1291
01:45:42,812 --> 01:45:45,933
How dare you do comedy with me?
- Hey, leave him.

1292
01:45:46,106 --> 01:45:48,234
Why are you hitting this innocent kid?

1293
01:45:48,314 --> 01:45:50,022
Does he look like
an innocent kid to you?

1294
01:45:50,102 --> 01:45:52,008
What wrong has he done to you?
- I will tell you.

1295
01:45:52,088 --> 01:45:54,975
Sir didn't call him, so I told him that.
He got angry on me.

1296
01:45:55,055 --> 01:45:57,335
Had he called who should he tell?

1297
01:45:57,415 --> 01:45:59,648
Me. - Had he not called
who should he tell?

1298
01:45:59,728 --> 01:46:02,945
Me. - He said the same thing.
- You don't understand. You stay quiet.

1299
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:08,002
You idiots, if you fight like this,
how will our country progress?

1300
01:46:08,082 --> 01:46:10,139
How will RCB win in IPL?

1301
01:46:10,219 --> 01:46:12,417
How will Salman Khan marry?

1302
01:46:12,497 --> 01:46:14,252
Only because we fight like this,

1303
01:46:14,332 --> 01:46:16,471
Trump became the president of America.

1304
01:46:16,551 --> 01:46:17,955
There was an earthquake in Japan.

1305
01:46:18,035 --> 01:46:20,303
Girls of our country are roaming
half naked in Goa.

1306
01:46:20,383 --> 01:46:22,767
Hey, go away! Read the newspaper.

1307
01:46:22,847 --> 01:46:25,571
Know about the world.
Have some general knowledge.

1308
01:46:25,651 --> 01:46:28,024
Illiterate fools. Move aside.

1309
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:32,431
What's the connection between me hitting
Kari and Salman Khan not getting married

1310
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:36,319
and girls roaming half naked in Goa?

1311
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:38,796
Chikka, listen to me.

1312
01:46:39,017 --> 01:46:41,728
I swear, sir didn't call you.
- You!

1313
01:46:41,808 --> 01:46:44,505
You!
- Hey!

1314
01:46:47,931 --> 01:46:49,976
Dear, be careful.

1315
01:46:50,209 --> 01:46:52,148
Nothing, I just tripped.

1316
01:46:52,228 --> 01:46:54,184
It's inauspicious.
- Nothing like that.

1317
01:46:54,444 --> 01:46:56,634
Its better you sit for a while
and then leave.

1318
01:46:56,714 --> 01:46:59,955
Even you think like her.
- Uncle, what's the matter?

1319
01:47:00,095 --> 01:47:02,770
They are getting tense
for a petty matter.

1320
01:47:08,089 --> 01:47:11,467
Uncle, if you don't mind,
can I come along to the factory?

1321
01:47:11,547 --> 01:47:15,049
The factory belongs to you.
Why do you need my permission?

1322
01:47:15,251 --> 01:47:16,873
You're most welcome. Come.

1323
01:47:42,439 --> 01:47:44,425
That's the export department...

1324
01:47:44,505 --> 01:47:46,789
Hey, who are you?

1325
01:47:46,869 --> 01:47:49,587
Get up. Why are you holding my feet?
Get up.

1326
01:49:35,749 --> 01:49:36,924
Raja!

1327
01:49:52,869 --> 01:49:54,572
Sir, our plan failed.

1328
01:49:54,652 --> 01:49:58,207
How did you fail?
Those boys were not ordinary.

1329
01:49:58,287 --> 01:50:00,234
They were powerful rowdies.

1330
01:50:00,423 --> 01:50:02,257
How did the plan fail!

1331
01:50:02,834 --> 01:50:04,038
You...

1332
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:18,462
Police is enquiring the men
that you had sent to kill my uncle.

1333
01:50:18,813 --> 01:50:22,178
If they reveal everything,
you'll land up in jail, that's a guarantee.

1334
01:50:22,422 --> 01:50:25,152
You were born to a good father,

1335
01:50:25,232 --> 01:50:28,359
but my grandpa was a scoundrel
and my father was a loafer.

1336
01:50:28,439 --> 01:50:29,791
I was born to him.

1337
01:50:30,155 --> 01:50:32,254
I am an evil person.

1338
01:50:33,218 --> 01:50:36,983
No matter which jail of India
they put me into, if I have a mobile,

1339
01:50:37,334 --> 01:50:40,292
the countdown of your family will begin.

1340
01:50:41,281 --> 01:50:43,691
Your uncle who runs
a medical store in Tumkur,

1341
01:50:43,771 --> 01:50:47,564
your paternal uncle who works
in the registrar's office in Hubli,

1342
01:50:47,644 --> 01:50:49,685
your aunt's daughter
who stays in Mangalore,

1343
01:50:49,765 --> 01:50:52,928
I will kill everyone.
- Who gave you their addresses?

1344
01:50:53,186 --> 01:50:56,049
Why? - My maternal uncle
stays in Channapatna,

1345
01:50:56,129 --> 01:50:57,833
my elder aunt stays in Mysore,

1346
01:50:57,913 --> 01:50:59,468
my brother-in-law stays in Bijapur,

1347
01:50:59,548 --> 01:51:01,360
my elder uncle stays in Shimoga,

1348
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:03,278
my youngest uncle
who stays in Chikmagalur.

1349
01:51:03,358 --> 01:51:06,738
Write down the address.
If you have guts, touch any one of them.

1350
01:51:08,887 --> 01:51:10,928
If you start, it's a fight,

1351
01:51:11,306 --> 01:51:14,077
if I start, it's riots.

1352
01:51:36,848 --> 01:51:38,210
Where's Ratan?

1353
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:41,132
Ratan, look at this video.

1354
01:51:47,861 --> 01:51:49,297
What happened, son?

1355
01:51:52,844 --> 01:51:55,483
I will not spare him, mom.
I will not spare him.

1356
01:51:55,563 --> 01:51:57,186
I will kill him.

1357
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:01,348
Ratan, this is for you.

1358
01:52:03,024 --> 01:52:05,267
Son, don't spare him.

1359
01:52:05,347 --> 01:52:07,278
No, I won't.
- Don't spare him.

1360
01:52:14,590 --> 01:52:17,361
Look here, Anushka Shetty

1361
01:52:17,767 --> 01:52:21,591
had worn this sari in the movie 'Baahubali'.
Show them more.

1362
01:52:22,348 --> 01:52:26,672
This sari was worn by Deepika Padukone
in the movie 'Ram Leela.'

1363
01:52:26,827 --> 01:52:30,051
Geeta, this color will
look very good on you.

1364
01:52:30,267 --> 01:52:32,186
Ma'am, I don't want.
- Why?

1365
01:52:32,266 --> 01:52:35,280
My boyfriend doesn't like dark colors.

1366
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,700
Oh boyfriend?
- Yes.

1367
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:40,673
Who is he?
- Who else? - Who?

1368
01:52:40,753 --> 01:52:43,267
The one and only Raja, Viraj.

1369
01:52:44,225 --> 01:52:45,875
Raja?

1370
01:52:45,955 --> 01:52:48,254
Yes.
- Hello, don't joke.

1371
01:52:48,334 --> 01:52:51,484
You can fell a mango only by hitting
stone on it. - What do you mean?

1372
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:56,538
I mean, there are thousands of girls
waiting to marry him since his school days.

1373
01:52:56,618 --> 01:52:58,551
But he hasn't agreed to anyone.

1374
01:52:58,631 --> 01:53:01,822
Oh hello, even I have fan following.

1375
01:53:01,902 --> 01:53:02,686
Even during rainy season,

1376
01:53:02,766 --> 01:53:05,956
guys hold umbrellas and stand
in a big queue outside my house.

1377
01:53:06,036 --> 01:53:07,902
Oh.
- Oh God.

1378
01:53:07,982 --> 01:53:10,548
We forgot to get the umbrella.

1379
01:53:12,167 --> 01:53:13,997
Hello, is he your fan?

1380
01:53:16,511 --> 01:53:19,160
Like you say,
this is not a one way love story.

1381
01:53:19,733 --> 01:53:22,700
Then?
- Even Raja loves me.

1382
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:24,741
Raja?
- Raja?

1383
01:53:24,821 --> 01:53:27,443
We don't believe it.
- Even I don't believe it.

1384
01:53:27,755 --> 01:53:30,930
Why?
- No one will believe it. - Look.

1385
01:53:31,201 --> 01:53:33,579
We brought up Raja.

1386
01:53:33,659 --> 01:53:36,904
He won't take any decision
without our permission.

1387
01:53:36,984 --> 01:53:39,539
Oh, you mean to say,

1388
01:53:39,619 --> 01:53:42,674
I am lying to you?
- Yes. - Yes.

1389
01:53:44,194 --> 01:53:45,679
Raja is here.

1390
01:53:46,074 --> 01:53:49,566
Okay. You all hide,
I will prove it to you right now.

1391
01:53:49,646 --> 01:53:52,472
Go, hurry up.
- Let's see.

1392
01:53:52,552 --> 01:53:55,269
Hurry up.
- Come on. - Hey old man, leave.

1393
01:53:59,195 --> 01:54:00,620
Hi.

1394
01:54:08,727 --> 01:54:12,647
Our house was like a government office,
it's become like a theater.

1395
01:54:14,731 --> 01:54:17,486
I think something is fishy.

1396
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:21,905
Sit down.
- Sit?

1397
01:54:23,992 --> 01:54:26,283
How are you?
- What?

1398
01:54:27,662 --> 01:54:29,051
Forget that.

1399
01:54:29,892 --> 01:54:35,702
Do you remember when did you
propose to me? - Propose?

1400
01:54:35,979 --> 01:54:38,621
When did I propose to you?
- What did you say?

1401
01:54:39,459 --> 01:54:42,756
Look, when babies don't eat food,
mothers show them the moon.

1402
01:54:43,081 --> 01:54:45,689
They don't show the food
and make them eat the moon.

1403
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:48,865
What are you saying?
- What are you saying?

1404
01:54:49,689 --> 01:54:51,838
If you like me, you propose to me.

1405
01:54:52,162 --> 01:54:55,175
You're not so good looking,
but still I will manage. - What?

1406
01:54:55,905 --> 01:54:57,905
I can't take the decision myself.

1407
01:54:57,985 --> 01:55:02,459
My mom, my maternal aunts,
and my sister has to agree.

1408
01:55:02,539 --> 01:55:04,513
Even the dog and horse
of our house should agree.

1409
01:55:04,593 --> 01:55:07,742
Horse?
- Yes, I am a family hero.

1410
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:19,188
All the aunts, please come out.

1411
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:22,729
Aunts?
- Yeah!

1412
01:55:23,108 --> 01:55:24,986
Were you all here?

1413
01:55:26,068 --> 01:55:27,203
Raja.
- Thank you.

1414
01:55:27,283 --> 01:55:30,934
Didn't I tell you my brother wouldn't
propose to you without our permission?

1415
01:55:31,014 --> 01:55:32,421
Oh, do you like her?

1416
01:55:32,501 --> 01:55:34,367
When did she say she likes her?
- Aunt, even you like her?

1417
01:55:34,447 --> 01:55:37,340
Oh, when did she say that?
- Do you all like her?

1418
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:39,107
We didn't say...
- Sir, do you also like her?

1419
01:55:39,187 --> 01:55:41,932
Yes.
- Okay then.

1420
01:55:42,012 --> 01:55:44,583
Okay, I love you. Have fun.

1421
01:55:44,786 --> 01:55:49,718
Here, change your DP
and status on Whatsapp. Have fun.

1422
01:55:50,326 --> 01:55:51,745
Bye, family.
- Raja!

1423
01:55:51,825 --> 01:55:53,705
Mom, did you see?

1424
01:55:53,785 --> 01:55:55,510
He acted so well.

1425
01:55:57,219 --> 01:56:01,043
You said you want to go to the city to
meet your friends. Where do I drop you?

1426
01:56:01,813 --> 01:56:04,165
I lied to you.
- Why?

1427
01:56:04,908 --> 01:56:07,151
I don't get to talk to you at home.

1428
01:56:07,231 --> 01:56:09,002
So I lied to you and came with you.

1429
01:56:09,082 --> 01:56:11,935
Hey, I am going to the court.
- I'll also come with you.

1430
01:56:12,015 --> 01:56:14,894
What will you do there?
- I will be your security guard.

1431
01:56:15,165 --> 01:56:16,144
Security?

1432
01:56:16,224 --> 01:56:19,058
Yes, villains are troubling
my boyfriend.

1433
01:56:19,138 --> 01:56:20,651
What if something goes wrong?

1434
01:56:23,963 --> 01:56:27,746
If somebody has to touch you,
he should go through me.

1435
01:56:44,265 --> 01:56:46,409
Will you stay here? I will be back.
- Okay.

1436
01:57:26,518 --> 01:57:28,167
Yes, Geeta.
- Hello, Raja.

1437
01:57:28,247 --> 01:57:30,370
The guy who had come
to murder SP in the theater,

1438
01:57:30,450 --> 01:57:31,846
I am following him.

1439
01:57:33,424 --> 01:57:35,681
Come soon.
- You leave, I will come.

1440
01:57:36,655 --> 01:57:37,723
Auto!

1441
01:57:39,263 --> 01:57:41,223
I will tell you the address,
you come soon.

1442
01:57:41,303 --> 01:57:43,871
Follow him, I am behind you.
- Okay.

1443
01:57:45,776 --> 01:57:46,817
Sir...

1444
01:57:52,425 --> 01:57:54,044
Sir, I'll put you on a conference call.

1445
01:58:08,655 --> 01:58:10,112
You leave.

1446
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:36,316
Hey, why are you following me?

1447
01:58:40,885 --> 01:58:42,275
Who are you?

1448
01:58:46,344 --> 01:58:47,871
Raja, he is the one.

1449
01:58:54,614 --> 01:58:56,972
Come on! If you have guts, come on.

1450
01:59:33,981 --> 01:59:34,981
SP, don't do that.
You're making a mistake.

1451
01:59:35,061 --> 01:59:37,454
If I give money, there are people
from your department who will help me.

1452
01:59:37,534 --> 01:59:40,197
I will get released in a few days.
Do you think you won?

1453
01:59:46,225 --> 01:59:48,246
Sir, Surya got arrested.

1454
01:59:49,157 --> 01:59:53,180
What are you saying?
SP and Raja caught him.

1455
01:59:53,332 --> 01:59:54,972
How did they both connect
with each other?

1456
01:59:55,052 --> 01:59:57,846
Sir, I think they know
about our business.

1457
01:59:58,009 --> 02:00:00,536
Don't irritate me by telling stories.

1458
02:00:02,846 --> 02:00:06,886
Yes, I know that Surya got arrested.
- Forget that matter.

1459
02:00:07,183 --> 02:00:09,859
SP is making a warrant to arrest you.

1460
02:00:09,939 --> 02:00:14,640
Let he do it.
I know how to get released from jail.

1461
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:18,832
As per my information,
SP is planning to kill you in an encounter.

1462
02:00:25,048 --> 02:00:28,007
"My darling, my dear." - Hey, Kari.

1463
02:00:28,595 --> 02:00:29,817
Get fruit for sir.

1464
02:00:29,897 --> 02:00:31,105
Which fruit?
- Banana.

1465
02:00:31,185 --> 02:00:32,317
Go and get it yourself.

1466
02:00:34,967 --> 02:00:37,290
Shall I go?
- No, I will go.

1467
02:00:42,223 --> 02:00:46,088
'How dare he order me to get a banana?
I will teach him a lesson.'

1468
02:00:46,777 --> 02:00:48,575
Chikka, take this.

1469
02:00:49,358 --> 02:00:50,484
What is this?
- A banana.

1470
02:00:50,564 --> 02:00:52,061
Where's the skin?
- I threw it. - Why?

1471
02:00:52,141 --> 02:00:53,304
What did you ask me to get?
- A banana.

1472
02:00:53,384 --> 02:00:54,101
I brought that for you.

1473
02:00:54,181 --> 02:00:56,428
Do you think I would've eaten it with the
skin had you brought it with the skin?

1474
02:00:56,508 --> 02:00:57,371
Hey!

1475
02:00:57,601 --> 02:01:00,290
You should've told me clearly that
you wanted to eat banana with the skin.

1476
02:01:00,370 --> 02:01:03,715
Had you told me earlier, I would've brought
the skin and threw the banana. - Hey!

1477
02:01:03,795 --> 02:01:06,804
You scoundrel,
how dare you make fun of me!

1478
02:01:06,884 --> 02:01:10,682
How dare you play pranks with me?

1479
02:01:10,953 --> 02:01:13,263
If I don't teach you a lesson,
you'll do it more.

1480
02:01:13,343 --> 02:01:17,626
How dare you play pranks with me?
Tell me! Come on!

1481
02:01:21,170 --> 02:01:23,535
I didn't hit you?
- I don't know.

1482
02:01:25,203 --> 02:01:29,103
I will kill you!
You idiots, you always keep fighting.

1483
02:01:29,183 --> 02:01:30,664
What's your problem?

1484
02:01:31,143 --> 02:01:33,805
I asked him to get a banana, he threw
the skin and brought only the banana.

1485
02:01:33,885 --> 02:01:35,751
You tell me what do I do to him?

1486
02:01:35,831 --> 02:01:37,900
What did you ask him to bring?
- A banana.

1487
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:40,291
He gave it to you.
- There's no skin on it. - You!

1488
02:01:40,371 --> 02:01:42,873
A human being eats the fruit
and a cow eats the skin.

1489
02:01:42,953 --> 02:01:46,305
Are you a cow or human being?
- I am a human being.

1490
02:01:46,602 --> 02:01:50,319
He doesn't keep his hands clean.
He always keeps scratching his body.

1491
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:53,264
If I eat fruit given by him,
I will suffer from some ailment.

1492
02:01:53,344 --> 02:01:58,007
You scoundrel, you eat the Pani Puri
on road side, you don't fall sick.

1493
02:01:58,087 --> 02:02:00,412
You eat Manchurian which has worms in it,
you don't fall sick.

1494
02:02:00,615 --> 02:02:04,223
If you eat this banana, you will fall sick.
Hey, give that cloth to me.

1495
02:02:05,182 --> 02:02:07,385
Give that banana to me.
- Hey!

1496
02:02:07,696 --> 02:02:09,615
Why are you wiping the banana
in a dirty cloth?

1497
02:02:09,695 --> 02:02:12,317
Hey, I clean the car worth 20 lakhs
with this cloth

1498
02:02:12,397 --> 02:02:15,223
and I am wiping this banana to you.

1499
02:02:15,303 --> 02:02:17,859
How dare you call it as dirty?
Come on, eat this. - Oh no!

1500
02:02:17,939 --> 02:02:20,148
Hey, get me that box. Let's wash this.

1501
02:02:20,228 --> 02:02:22,300
Hey!
- Come on, pour it over this.

1502
02:02:22,624 --> 02:02:24,278
Do you have phenyl?
- Phenyl?

1503
02:02:24,358 --> 02:02:26,159
Do you have Dettol soap with you?
- Yes, sir. - Dettol?

1504
02:02:26,516 --> 02:02:28,300
Now it is clean.
- Hey?

1505
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:30,473
Why are you washing the
banana like you wash clothes?

1506
02:02:31,186 --> 02:02:33,629
I will never eat a banana
in my life after seeing all this.

1507
02:02:33,709 --> 02:02:36,137
I don't want to eat this banana.
No, never!

1508
02:02:36,217 --> 02:02:37,802
That's not dirty water.

1509
02:02:37,882 --> 02:02:39,470
It is cow's urine.
- Cow's urine?

1510
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:41,273
Now this banana has become pure.

1511
02:02:41,353 --> 02:02:44,678
You have wasted 10 minutes
for this banana.

1512
02:02:44,758 --> 02:02:45,964
I will not leave you until you eat it.

1513
02:02:46,044 --> 02:02:47,618
Hey, come on, everyone make him eat it.
- What?

1514
02:02:47,698 --> 02:02:49,903
Hey, everyone make him eat the banana!

1515
02:03:11,575 --> 02:03:12,564
Sir, tell me.

1516
02:03:12,644 --> 02:03:15,251
No matter how much we tortured Suri,
he is not revealing anything.

1517
02:03:16,235 --> 02:03:19,251
I think they are planning
something dangerous.

1518
02:03:20,905 --> 02:03:23,521
You and your family members be careful.

1519
02:03:23,601 --> 02:03:24,649
'Okay, sir.'

1520
02:03:33,154 --> 02:03:36,018
'No matter how much we tortured Suri,
he is not revealing anything.'

1521
02:03:36,883 --> 02:03:39,543
'I think they are planning
something dangerous.'

1522
02:03:40,303 --> 02:03:43,553
'You and your family members
be careful.'

1523
02:03:44,980 --> 02:03:46,796
Raja, he will be here in five minutes.

1524
02:03:47,564 --> 02:03:48,770
Okay.

1525
02:04:09,748 --> 02:04:11,262
Chikka.
- Yes?

1526
02:04:11,342 --> 02:04:13,586
Find out who the guy in blue T-shirt is.

1527
02:04:13,823 --> 02:04:15,002
Okay.

1528
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:18,483
Hey, where are you taking me?

1529
02:04:19,196 --> 02:04:20,699
Leave me.

1530
02:04:21,575 --> 02:04:23,402
Raja, I think he has come here
with wrong intentions.

1531
02:04:24,029 --> 02:04:25,391
He has a gun with him.

1532
02:04:27,531 --> 02:04:28,719
Who are you?

1533
02:04:30,916 --> 02:04:32,883
Who are you?
- My name is Ratan.

1534
02:04:33,619 --> 02:04:35,121
I have come from Jodhpur.

1535
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:41,035
'Raj Thakur is the king of contract
killing business in Rajasthan.'

1536
02:04:41,115 --> 02:04:44,613
'My father was the district collector
of Raj Thakur's state.'

1537
02:04:44,693 --> 02:04:46,913
'He had put many cases on him.'

1538
02:04:47,125 --> 02:04:49,737
'Bhirava was Raj Thakur's
right hand then.'

1539
02:04:49,817 --> 02:04:53,261
'They both planned to kill my father.'

1540
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:10,451
'Listen, don't go.'

1541
02:05:10,531 --> 02:05:12,689
'Come inside.
- Nothing will happen. Don't worry.'

1542
02:05:13,295 --> 02:05:15,965
'Listen to me, just come inside.
- Dad, come inside. - Nothing will happen.'

1543
02:05:32,397 --> 02:05:33,768
'No!'

1544
02:05:34,657 --> 02:05:37,359
'Don't kill him. Don't kill my husband.
- No.'

1545
02:05:37,439 --> 02:05:39,111
'I beg of you. Leave him.'

1546
02:05:40,290 --> 02:05:41,565
'Dad.'

1547
02:05:43,685 --> 02:05:46,567
'By killing my father
Bhirava proved that'

1548
02:05:46,647 --> 02:05:49,414
'they both are above police
and the law.'

1549
02:05:50,041 --> 02:05:52,409
'They killed my father
in front of my eyes.'

1550
02:05:52,489 --> 02:05:54,225
'And I couldn't do anything.'

1551
02:05:58,150 --> 02:06:00,625
In the police records, Bhirava is dead.

1552
02:06:01,998 --> 02:06:04,225
We all thought he was dead.

1553
02:06:04,476 --> 02:06:07,847
But we saw in your video
that Bhirava is still alive.

1554
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,852
He not only ruined my house,
but many houses.

1555
02:06:11,317 --> 02:06:13,988
I will not spare him.

1556
02:06:14,068 --> 02:06:15,934
I will kill him.
- Hey, listen to me.

1557
02:06:16,409 --> 02:06:18,592
You take care of your mother.
I am telling you.

1558
02:06:18,672 --> 02:06:20,841
I will handle Bhirava.
- No, sir.

1559
02:06:21,198 --> 02:06:24,495
You go. Kari, take him.

1560
02:06:31,735 --> 02:06:33,933
Raja, don't be in haste.

1561
02:06:34,690 --> 02:06:36,203
What do I do?

1562
02:06:36,701 --> 02:06:38,863
For how long can I provide security
to my family members?

1563
02:06:39,566 --> 02:06:41,826
He has ruined many families.

1564
02:06:42,311 --> 02:06:44,236
I won't let that continue.

1565
02:06:44,776 --> 02:06:47,836
After the veneration tonight,
Bhirava will be...

1566
02:06:48,484 --> 02:06:49,835
What do you mean?

1567
02:06:52,376 --> 02:06:55,662
This plan shouldn't fail at any cost.
- Okay, sir.

1568
02:06:55,742 --> 02:06:57,489
This is our last chance.

1569
02:06:57,569 --> 02:06:59,522
I am leaving.
- Okay.

1570
02:07:39,134 --> 02:07:41,502
Where are you?
- Raja, we're coming. We're on the way.

1571
02:07:41,582 --> 02:07:42,777
Be careful.

1572
02:09:52,271 --> 02:09:53,569
Raja.

1573
02:10:30,616 --> 02:10:35,146
Uncle? Lavanya, why are you all tense?

1574
02:10:35,406 --> 02:10:37,590
Nothing happened to them.
They just met with a small accident.

1575
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:39,190
Why did you all come here?

1576
02:10:40,368 --> 02:10:42,087
What are you doing here?

1577
02:10:47,221 --> 02:10:48,573
What's the matter?

1578
02:10:49,902 --> 02:10:51,480
What happened to whom?

1579
02:10:53,588 --> 02:10:54,809
What happened?

1580
02:10:55,826 --> 02:10:57,047
What happened?

1581
02:11:30,918 --> 02:11:35,081
Mom, I made a mistake.
You told me to break his hand.

1582
02:11:35,858 --> 02:11:37,625
Not just his hand,

1583
02:11:38,431 --> 02:11:40,975
I should've killed him.

1584
02:11:42,928 --> 02:11:44,442
Had I killed him that day,

1585
02:11:45,101 --> 02:11:47,220
you wouldn't have been
in this condition today.

1586
02:11:50,150 --> 02:11:53,328
I beg of you, please don't leave me.

1587
02:11:55,307 --> 02:11:59,037
I will give you
the news of his death soon.

1588
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:06,388
I don't have the courage
to live without you.

1589
02:12:36,816 --> 02:12:39,618
Raja, Ratan had called.
Bhirava is in Rajasthan.

1590
02:12:43,221 --> 02:12:44,961
I traced Bhirava's phone call.

1591
02:12:45,041 --> 02:12:46,864
I learnt he's in Jodhpur.

1592
02:12:46,944 --> 02:12:49,415
I will arrest him within 48 hours.

1593
02:12:49,957 --> 02:12:51,761
I can't wait until you arrest the man

1594
02:12:51,841 --> 02:12:54,004
who attacked my mom.

1595
02:12:54,393 --> 02:12:55,534
Raja!

1596
02:12:57,069 --> 02:12:59,689
I showed you concern
because you saved my life,

1597
02:12:59,769 --> 02:13:01,945
but you're taking advantage of it.

1598
02:13:02,025 --> 02:13:06,194
If you try to harm Bhirava,
I will have to arrest you.

1599
02:13:16,053 --> 02:13:19,036
Do you think I will tell that?
- Never.

1600
02:13:20,571 --> 02:13:23,155
You shouldn't sympathize the enemy.

1601
02:13:23,437 --> 02:13:27,156
When Lord Ram killed Ravana,
no one said Lord Ram was a murderer.

1602
02:13:28,117 --> 02:13:30,907
They said he was brave,
courageous and a warrior.

1603
02:13:31,512 --> 02:13:36,474
He has to die from your hands because
he has done injustice to your family.

1604
02:13:37,058 --> 02:13:38,906
I will handle the rest.

1605
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:41,160
Go. Kill him!

1606
02:14:07,823 --> 02:14:10,429
Bhirava and Raj Thakur live together.

1607
02:14:10,509 --> 02:14:12,774
It's difficult to meet him.

1608
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:17,566
Mom, this is Raja.

1609
02:14:17,867 --> 02:14:19,997
Bhirava tried to kill his mother.

1610
02:14:20,077 --> 02:14:23,283
He not only ruined our lives,
but of many people.

1611
02:14:23,363 --> 02:14:25,781
Don't spare him.

1612
02:14:25,861 --> 02:14:28,516
Don't spare him.
- Mom, calm down.

1613
02:14:28,596 --> 02:14:30,591
Don't spare him.
- Come with me.

1614
02:14:34,808 --> 02:14:37,284
Listen, I have to meet
Raj Thakur at any cost.

1615
02:14:37,364 --> 02:14:39,298
There's only one way,
but it is too dangerous.

1616
02:14:39,378 --> 02:14:40,202
No problem.

1617
02:14:48,192 --> 02:14:50,657
He's the one
who I spoke to you about on phone.

1618
02:14:52,041 --> 02:14:53,230
Come on, sit.

1619
02:14:56,138 --> 02:14:58,257
Hey, only he can come with me.

1620
02:14:58,337 --> 02:15:00,063
Move.
- No problem.

1621
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:15,425
He's the one.

1622
02:15:18,537 --> 02:15:19,780
Have you brought the money?

1623
02:15:51,683 --> 02:15:53,279
What is your name?

1624
02:15:55,813 --> 02:15:57,425
Where are you from?

1625
02:16:00,861 --> 02:16:02,499
Are you a Madrasi?

1626
02:16:06,883 --> 02:16:07,986
I'm from Karnataka.

1627
02:16:08,066 --> 02:16:11,856
Yes, Madrasi or Karnataka,
everything is same.

1628
02:16:16,322 --> 02:16:17,890
Come on, Madrasi, tell me,

1629
02:16:18,581 --> 02:16:21,561
why have you come here?

1630
02:16:22,462 --> 02:16:25,435
I have come to give you a contract.
- Contract?

1631
02:16:26,450 --> 02:16:28,255
Whose contract?

1632
02:16:28,807 --> 02:16:30,277
First tell me your rate.

1633
02:16:31,445 --> 02:16:36,570
You want to know the rate
without telling the name.

1634
02:16:41,248 --> 02:16:43,134
50 lakhs.

1635
02:16:45,099 --> 02:16:46,645
I'm giving you 5 lakhs advance.

1636
02:16:56,645 --> 02:16:59,654
Madrasi, tell me the name.

1637
02:16:59,932 --> 02:17:01,867
Bhirava.
- Who?

1638
02:17:02,202 --> 02:17:03,498
Bhirava!

1639
02:17:15,249 --> 02:17:16,686
I was getting confused

1640
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:21,930
from so many days as to how to kill you.

1641
02:17:23,574 --> 02:17:27,025
But you yourself got trapped here.

1642
02:17:28,244 --> 02:17:32,103
Hey, you're Raja only in Karnataka.

1643
02:17:32,752 --> 02:17:35,261
Here, Thakur is the king.

1644
02:17:37,358 --> 02:17:40,850
If he wishes, in only five minutes,

1645
02:17:41,110 --> 02:17:45,229
he will get your entire family killed.

1646
02:17:48,548 --> 02:17:52,667
You made a mistake
by entering this jungle.

1647
02:17:53,661 --> 02:17:57,469
Everyone is cruel here.

1648
02:17:59,954 --> 02:18:03,037
Confirm.
- What is confirmed?

1649
02:18:03,986 --> 02:18:05,846
I am the hunter.

1650
02:18:16,549 --> 02:18:19,457
I am not a Madrasi, but a Kannadiga.

1651
02:18:27,317 --> 02:18:30,949
You said you would get
my entire family killed in five minutes,

1652
02:18:31,673 --> 02:18:34,472
how can a corpse touch my family?

1653
02:18:35,208 --> 02:18:38,024
I am not Raja only in Karnataka,

1654
02:18:42,743 --> 02:18:46,505
I am the king of the place I step on.

1655
02:19:41,887 --> 02:19:43,953
How dare you attack on my mother?

1656
02:20:05,998 --> 02:20:08,438
Forgive me. Don't harm me.

1657
02:20:09,001 --> 02:20:11,725
I made a mistake.
Please don't harm me.

1658
02:20:12,525 --> 02:20:16,039
I beg of you, please forgive me.

1659
02:20:16,119 --> 02:20:19,066
I swear on my mother,
I will never make a mistake again.

1660
02:20:19,146 --> 02:20:21,866
I swear on my mother, please believe me.

1661
02:20:22,981 --> 02:20:25,951
Please forgive me,
I will not make a mistake.
