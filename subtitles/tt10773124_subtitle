1
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:17,398
He's in Seat number 12.

2
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,794
Neither did he take the last 
flight nor did he leave by road.

3
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:24,342
Like you said, he's 
heading in the train sir.

4
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,460
Finish him!

5
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:38,875
The damn bartender refused 
to give more alcohol!

6
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,298
The liquor had no effect on me.

7
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:43,658
If only I could've 
had another peg...

8
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:01,518
It's midnight, yet why 
aren't you all asleep?

9
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:04,205
We're the ones who are supposed 
to ask you this question, not you!

10
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,055
But it's you guys who need to 
wake up for work tomorrow, not us.

11
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,791
We have no job or errand to run.

12
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,508
The club called to us tell that 
four oldies are refusing..

13
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,760
...to leave the table despite 
it being the closing hour.

14
00:09:16,785 --> 00:09:19,222
Did he refer to us as oldies? 
- Dad!

15
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:22,580
You're a doctor. It's 
easy to advise everyone.

16
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,722
But make sure you 
stand without waltzing.

17
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:28,107
Gopali! Meet my daughter! 
- Hello!

18
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:32,579
Dear Father! Are you trying to 
introduce me to my father-in-law?

19
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:35,185
Where's my daughter? 
Did she fall asleep?

20
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,537
I'm right here, dad!

21
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:40,342
And why did the three of you come 
here instead of heading home?

22
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,789
Do you plan to continue boozing?

23
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:45,521
Heavens no! There's not a single 
bottle of Whiskey, Brandy at home!

24
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:47,841
Except for a bottle of Gin! 
- Thank God!

25
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:48,977
There's no stock!

26
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:52,649
Everyone complains about their kids 
and grand kids coming home late...

27
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:55,009
And it's the opposite 
in our house!

28
00:09:56,314 --> 00:10:01,254
Come on! We're fine. We all 
can walk, run, jump and fly.

29
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,502
What do you say?

30
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:05,772
As you say! Go to bed now. We 
can discuss this in the morning.

31
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:07,203
Please go!

32
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:11,109
They're standing right here. There's 
no fun in drinking like this.

33
00:10:11,134 --> 00:10:13,647
Good night! 
- Let's go!

34
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,478
When I came to this house, 
I was ten-years-old.

35
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,572
At first, I was a cleaner. 
Later I became the gardener.

36
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,533
And then, I was the watchman, 
until I became their milkman.

37
00:10:47,558 --> 00:10:49,994
I sneaked into this house 
and became their cook.

38
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:53,221
After grandpa's time, I'll 
be the boss of this house.

39
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:57,033
You? The boss? 
- Why not?

40
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:59,183
Can't an employee become 
the boss of the house?

41
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:04,199
If our younger boss hears you, 
your job will go out of the window!

42
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:09,393
Yeah right! No boss of this 
house can get me out of here!

43
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:14,049
Because I'm here thanks to the 
lady boss' influence! Got it?!

44
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:17,783
Take any house, those who are employed 
by the man of the house, don't stay back.

45
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:21,512
And the one's employed by the woman of 
the house will not leave the place.

46
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,102
Mark my words! With time, I shall 
rise higher! Keep watching!

47
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,246
Yeah right!

48
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,888
Things are yet to grow down 
there, and he speaks of rising up!

49
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:31,950
What do you mean?

50
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,927
Get rid of these 
shorts and wear pants!

51
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:35,763
Maybe then you can develop!

52
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,685
Mark my words! I shall make 
sure you develop things first!

53
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:44,084
Only then will I 
develop the rest!

54
00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:48,038
Saru, study hard for another year 
and be done with the course. Okay?

55
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:50,358
Don't listen to your friends 
and skip classes. Got it?

56
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,593
Kids aren't supposed to 
take phones to school.

57
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:53,647
Tulasi?

58
00:11:54,476 --> 00:11:56,757
It's getting late. 
Hurry up!

59
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,038
Bye mom!

60
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,918
I'll be there in ten minutes.

61
00:11:59,943 --> 00:12:02,402
*MUFFLED CONVERSATION* 
GOPAL: Boys?

62
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:04,735
I've fixed an appointment 
at the parlour.

63
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,152
Meera? 
- Grandpa?

64
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:09,237
We're late. Let's go! 
- We need to go shopping.

65
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:13,385
I'm waiting for my cup of coffee. 
Seems like no one's concerned.

66
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:22,753
What's up doc? 
How come you're serving coffee?

67
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:28,323
Apparently nobody will take care of you 
today for coming home late last night.

68
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,463
You're being punished.

69
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:35,135
When I was out walking, my daughter 
asked me to make breakfast for you.

70
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,589
All I know is to make omelette 
from a country chicken's egg.

71
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,472
And you can attach a copy to us. 
- Okay.

72
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:48,182
Excuse me. 
- Hello?

73
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:50,472
Huh?

74
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:51,628
What?

75
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:52,845
Gosh!

76
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:58,659
Next!

77
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:01,110
Who are these girls?

78
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,259
Doesn't she seem fine?

79
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:05,291
Everything is fine, but she should 
be compatible with Gopi right?

80
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:08,246
May I come in sir? 
- Welcome. Take your seat!

81
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:10,211
Your name? 
- Sundari.

82
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:11,634
Age? 
- 30!

83
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,306
Marital status? 
- Married.

84
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:15,548
What does your husband do? 
- He's a Taxi driver.

85
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:18,563
Then you're rejected. 
- We're not looking for married women.

86
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:22,306
We need a spinster or a 
divorcee to take care of Gopi!

87
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:28,852
This picture's good.

88
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,659
Uncle, what's 
happening here?

89
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:32,492
From now on, there's 
no need for anyone..

90
00:13:32,517 --> 00:13:34,211
...to worry about your 
father's well being.

91
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:37,492
We're looking for a partner 
to take care of him!

92
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,422
What? 
- I mean.. A caretaker!

93
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,004
We're looking for 
a female caretaker.

94
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,129
To give your father meds on time, 
to massage his leg when he's tired..

95
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:48,340
To take care of his breakfast, 
coffee, lunch and bed at night..

96
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,056
Dad! 
- Why are you chiding us?

97
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:54,657
Your father-in-law's 
announced in on social media..

98
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,845
The video's trending 
on the net today!

99
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,824
My dear in-law, you don't have 
to justify anything to them.

100
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:03,291
Please continue 
with the interviews.

101
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:04,659
Next! 
- What's all this?

102
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:08,612
All thanks to your idea of punishing 
him, he's returning us the favour!

103
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:12,854
We followed your words and ended up 
not giving him even a cup of coffee!

104
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,860
It's entirely your fault. 
Bear with it!

105
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:17,196
I've been divorced from my 
husband for over five years!

106
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:18,642
Very good. 
- How old are you?

107
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,720
I'm only 35! 
- Very good!

108
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:22,384
Is your husband paying 
for your living?

109
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:24,821
He's paying for my living, 
and living with another woman!

110
00:14:24,849 --> 00:14:27,435
Which means your 
future is fixed!

111
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,349
Shall I take the measurements? 
- You may now!

112
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:31,482
Let me take a picture. 
- Congratulations young lady!

113
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,833
Dad! Uncle! 
- Please stop this.

114
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:38,193
Your granddaughter's getting engaged 
next week. Does this seem necessary now?

115
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:41,833
Father, please forgive us.

116
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,974
We'll take good care 
of you from now.

117
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:48,067
Gopi! Don't let 
sentimental words melt you.

118
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:49,629
Dad! Quiet!

119
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,874
Uncle, please! 
*IN UNISON*

120
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:55,988
Fine! Based on your assurance..

121
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,574
Boys? 
- Yes?

122
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:02,121
The Interviews are cancelled. 
Pay them their fee and send them off.

123
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:04,816
Let's get back to work. 
- We shall leave now. Take care.

124
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,488
Please come along sir! 
- Greetings!

125
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:22,662
Please come in madam!

126
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:26,043
Welcome. I'm sorry if 
the rains troubled you.

127
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:28,116
Greetings! Welcome!

128
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:30,304
Seek blessings from the elders.

129
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,725
May you be blessed!

130
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,607
Let me do this, please!

131
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:38,710
Madam, you're looking very nice!

132
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,295
But one tiny correction.

133
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,061
What is that? 
- Let your hair down.

134
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:45,428
You'll look prettier. 
- Is it? Okay.

135
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:49,808
Looks like my evil eyes will get you. 
Madam, don't mind my words but..

136
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,091
You'll look better with a round 
bindi instead of a vertical one.

137
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:55,286
Let me take the flowers.

138
00:15:57,785 --> 00:15:59,878
And you are? 
- Groom's mother!

139
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:02,911
What? You look like his sister. 
I can't believe it.

140
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:06,177
Let me take it! 
What happened?

141
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:09,034
It's nothing. 
- First, it's for the kids.

142
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,668
The ladies get it next, and then 
it's the oldies' turn. Okay?

143
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:18,707
Come on kids, there you go. 
- Thank you uncle!

144
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:20,653
What a player he is!

145
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:25,567
His words.. His touch.. 
Everything was superb!

146
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:28,009
Did he play all 
his tricks at once?

147
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:31,845
Careful! He seems like a Ram, 
pray he doesn't ram into you!

148
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,626
Relax until the bride appears. 
- Thank you!

149
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:38,048
Seems like the groom's family 
has got an antagonist for me!

150
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:39,274
Here's some juice!

151
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,556
Ummm.. No thanks!

152
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:44,363
And for you guys? 
- No thank you! We're fine.

153
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,511
Didn't you say there was 
some Gin in your room?

154
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:48,829
There we go! 
- Does this seem like a club to you?

155
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:52,633
If we start drinking, 
there'll be a war at home!

156
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:53,916
Nothing can go wrong!

157
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:55,885
Tell us where the bottle 
is and let us handle it.

158
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:59,830
It's on the table in my room. 
But I'm not getting it.

159
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:03,056
Come on! How can you refuse a 
happy drink at the happy hours?

160
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:16,212
Damn this guy! Who's he serving 
the coconut cocktail to?

161
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,782
Some coconut water for you. 
- Nah!

162
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:20,392
Sir! This is a nice Ginny blend! 
- What? Give us some!

163
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,306
There you go!

164
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:23,531
What about me?

165
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:26,743
You really shouldn't. You'll have to 
talk to the groom's family, right?

166
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:32,954
This is no ordinary coconut water. 
He's mixed elixir in it!

167
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:34,493
Is it? Let me taste some.

168
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:36,829
Yeah right! Didn't you 
put up an act back then?

169
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:40,830
Who is this scene stealer? 
He can't be one of us.

170
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:42,392
Must be from the groom's family!

171
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,243
Wow! You look beautiful!

172
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:47,416
Thanks!

173
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:54,868
Fits you perfectly!

174
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:01,728
Where are you? 
- On the way!

175
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:04,917
What do you mean? The 
groom's family is here!

176
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:07,261
Who will read out the invitation vows? 
- I'm almost there.

177
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,355
Get here soon!

178
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:12,132
You smallie! 
There's another cocktail left. Want some?

179
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:15,383
Hold it! Follow me!

180
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:20,390
There you go! 
- Is this mine?

181
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:23,234
Enjoy! 
- Thank you!

182
00:18:27,414 --> 00:18:30,055
Dear Lord! Protect me!

183
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:40,379
Lord Harihareshwara!

184
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:45,450
My laptop hung! Apologies!

185
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:48,449
Please come! 
- Forgive me for being late.

186
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:49,997
It's okay. Please be seated.

187
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,737
This is an auspicious moment.

188
00:18:52,762 --> 00:18:55,622
Mr.Dattu! How's your health? 
And your diabetes?

189
00:18:55,647 --> 00:18:58,309
Have some Jamun seeds. 
It's help you!

190
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,091
Can I proceed? 
- Sure.

191
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:11,488
On the next Friday of Shravana month. 
Shukla period.

192
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:14,043
On the 9th of August of 2019..

193
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:18,818
At 10 A.M. of the Abhijin 
hour, in the presence of elders..

194
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:21,981
It is decided that the 
marriage will be conducted.

195
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:49,976
This is a perfect cocktail!

196
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:57,851
You must be the only moron 
to get drunk from water!

197
00:19:57,876 --> 00:19:59,235
This is psychology!

198
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,305
This is bliss!

199
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:06,312
We want you all to visit us before the 
marriage and experience our hospitality.

200
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:08,148
That way you'll get to 
meet our entire family.

201
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,227
Sure.

202
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:10,953
Make sure you bring 
that guy along!

203
00:20:11,436 --> 00:20:12,467
Which guy?

204
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:15,453
That guy who was actively 
doing all the work.

205
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,719
He came holding an 
umbrella with all of you.

206
00:20:17,744 --> 00:20:20,366
Not really. He got the 
umbrella from your house.

207
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,991
He's not one of us.

208
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,576
Who is he? Go check 
if he's inside.

209
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:28,178
We shall take your leave!

210
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:31,068
If he's not from either of our side..

211
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:32,614
Who could he be? 
- Look upstairs!

212
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,249
Find him! 
- I'll check the other side!

213
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:36,655
What is everyone looking for?

214
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:39,644
My boss is apparently missing. 
- What?!

215
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:40,848
Forgive me sir!

216
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:44,020
I'm right here.

217
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:51,011
I found out.. that you're 
looking for someone..

218
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:54,518
...to take care of master, 
in a video online.

219
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:57,441
I realised that you were 
looking for a woman.

220
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:01,238
But still, I'm here 
to take a chance.

221
00:21:01,824 --> 00:21:05,535
Instead of telling what I can do, 
I thought of letting you see for yourself!

222
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,394
If you liked what you 
saw, you may employ me.

223
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:11,285
And if we didn't? 
Will you leave?

224
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:15,394
We don't need him! 
Send him away!

225
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,442
Stay quiet!

226
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:20,691
Where will we find a better worker 
than you in all of Karnataka?

227
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,452
From now on.. You will work.

228
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:29,229
Specially, for me!

229
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,270
Thank you!

230
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:40,950
Look here and talk!

231
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:44,224
So, they took you in, huh? 
- Yep!

232
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:47,450
I'm completely 
sober thanks to you!

233
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:51,621
With you around, I wonder 
what my fate holds for me!

234
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,120
Dear Comrade!

235
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,864
You're the first one to pass out 
after drinking water! God bless you!

236
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:02,081
Krishna.. 
- Master?

237
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:04,681
The reason I asked you to 
stay in my room, is because..

238
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,825
If you stay out there, 
everyone will assign you work.

239
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,215
That would be troublesome 
for both of us.

240
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,999
From now on, you will 
eat, bathe and sleep here.

241
00:22:13,024 --> 00:22:14,241
This will be your bed.

242
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,139
There's the medicine box. 
Bring it over.

243
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:23,371
I need to take the red tablet once 
in the day and twice at night.

244
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,708
And I need to take the blue tablet 
twice in the noon and once at night.

245
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:28,098
Oh! Trika!

246
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,473
This one reduces anxiety 
and lets you sleep well.

247
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:32,318
And Losaro, controls 
your blood pressure.

248
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:33,818
Do you know a lot 
about medicine?

249
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:37,395
I worked for two 
years at a pharmacy.

250
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,630
Therefore, 
I know a bit about medicines.

251
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:43,529
That's wonderful. I don't 
need a doctor anymore.

252
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:48,521
Daddy! I'm scared.

253
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:51,068
Don't be. Get some sleep!

254
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,810
You're from RK studios, right? 
- Yes madam.

255
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,725
Do you have my engagement video? 
- There.

256
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,545
Give it to me! 
Everyone!

257
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:36,100
My engagement video's here!

258
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:38,872
I changed my hairstyle 
for the first time in the..

259
00:24:38,897 --> 00:24:40,639
...engagement. I want 
to see how I look.

260
00:24:40,664 --> 00:24:44,195
You seem more worried about your looks 
than of your daughter and the son-in-law's.

261
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,767
They need to change themselves to look 
good, but I look good no matter what.

262
00:24:48,037 --> 00:24:49,230
Hey Gopi!

263
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,598
Doctor! Police and the Lawyer!

264
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,394
How did you make it 
at the right time?

265
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:55,841
My granddaughter told me 
that the engagement video..

266
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:58,142
...will arrive at 10 A.M. 
and asked us to be here.

267
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,101
So only we came over. 
- That's good.

268
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,016
Set the Home theater up. 
- Sure sir.

269
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:07,127
Why do they all seem so unaffected 
about the happenings in their backyard?

270
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:09,424
Careful kids!

271
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:11,147
Krishna! Join us.

272
00:25:25,514 --> 00:25:27,256
Greetings! Welcome!

273
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:29,717
Grandpa looks like a star!

274
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:45,352
Woah!

275
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,362
This is no ordinary coconut water. 
He's mixed elixir in it!

276
00:25:49,387 --> 00:25:53,809
Uncle! Why do you have that crook like 
face while drinking coconut water?

277
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,767
Why do you all have such 
different reactions?

278
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,780
Sit down! Those who're behind can't see. 
- Will you sit down?

279
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:02,567
Damn our fate!

280
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:04,363
He's got a shot 
of the pickle too!

281
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,333
Coconut water and pickle? Heh?!

282
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:11,606
I've never seen this combo before.

283
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:13,505
Which means the coconut water..

284
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:15,497
Was mixed with something.

285
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:18,653
I'll reveal the coconut 
cocktail secret.

286
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:21,989
Look what he's done. 
- Your pickle fetish has got us caught now!

287
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24,005
Was it necessary? 
- Keep quiet!

288
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:26,598
Brother! I've something to tell. 
- Get lost!

289
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:30,943
It was Krishna who mixed 
coconut water in the pickle!

290
00:26:30,968 --> 00:26:32,217
Trust me!

291
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:36,683
Boss, please listen to me.

292
00:26:37,824 --> 00:26:41,855
It was Krishna who mixed 
the Gin in the pickle!

293
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,988
Trust me.

294
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,750
It was him who mixed 
pickle in the coconut water!

295
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,079
Trust me.

296
00:26:55,312 --> 00:26:57,742
Why is the pickle 
bothering me so much?

297
00:26:58,164 --> 00:26:59,703
What am I trying to say?

298
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,781
It was him, who mixed 
Gin in the coconut water..

299
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:05,898
On the next Friday of Shravana month. 
Shukla period.

300
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:08,259
On the 9th of August of 2019..

301
00:27:08,756 --> 00:27:13,219
At 10 A.M. of the Abhijin 
hour, in the presence of elders..

302
00:27:13,244 --> 00:27:16,480
It is decided that the 
marriage will be conducted.

303
00:27:35,214 --> 00:27:36,949
Lakshmi!

304
00:27:44,318 --> 00:27:45,855
Oh God!

305
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:50,037
Devaki! Vasudeva!

306
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,180
What a disaster 
my life has become!

307
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,558
Stop it!

308
00:28:03,073 --> 00:28:04,346
Turn it off!

309
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,448
Who put this video along 
with the previous one?!

310
00:28:09,535 --> 00:28:12,846
Do you wish to show my 
Lakshmi and burn me alive?

311
00:28:13,003 --> 00:28:15,454
The video must have 
been in the pen drive.

312
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:20,057
I didn't think it would 
play automatically. I'm sorry.

313
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:30,247
Everyone walked in celebrating, and 
now they're walking out mourning.

314
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,592
God, why this grief in a 
happy home like this?

315
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:42,944
Gopi.

316
00:28:44,068 --> 00:28:45,513
Get some rest.

317
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,295
We'll come back tomorrow.

318
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:00,452
Master.

319
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:02,944
What happened?

320
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,631
Who is she?

321
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:06,741
Don't ask me anything, Krishna.

322
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,304
You're nowhere connected to it.

323
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:11,459
Maybe..

324
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:13,742
But who did we see on the screen?

325
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,491
What's happening 
in the outhouse?

326
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:20,568
You're talking as 
if you know it all.

327
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,374
I'm asking you because I don't.

328
00:29:23,015 --> 00:29:25,233
From now on, don't ever 
go to the outhouse.

329
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,258
Don't ask me anything.

330
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,763
Okay Master. I'll get 
you something to eat.

331
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:33,452
I don't want anything Krishna.

332
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:36,022
Leave me alone.

333
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,818
Sorry dad!

334
00:29:48,256 --> 00:29:49,373
But why?

335
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:52,006
I was the one who 
gave the pen drive.

336
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:53,366
Oh God!

337
00:29:57,093 --> 00:29:58,210
Let it be.

338
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:00,914
It wasn't intentional. 
You're not at fault.

339
00:30:02,006 --> 00:30:03,397
Go have your lunch.

340
00:30:03,632 --> 00:30:07,084
I don't want anything. 
- Listen to me dear.

341
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:10,715
Sridevi. Take her. 
Both of you eat something.

342
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,466
Dad, I don't want anything.

343
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:06,426
A star floated down the sky, 
asking me what my secret was!

344
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:11,605
‘Wherever you go, people adore you. 
Tell me why’ the star went on to ask.

345
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:17,027
A star floated down the sky, 
asking me what my secret was!

346
00:31:17,053 --> 00:31:22,389
‘Wherever you go, people adore you. 
Tell me why’ the star went on to ask.

347
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:27,461
For there’s magic right in me, 
Everyone adores me a lot.

348
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:32,383
For there’s music in laughter, 
And everyone pays heed to it.

349
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:57,909
This hour shall never return..

350
00:31:57,934 --> 00:31:59,298
And this moment is solely yours.

351
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,915
All the happiness you seek, 
is out there for you.

352
00:32:05,607 --> 00:32:08,362
Life is an expansive ocean..

353
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:10,844
Loss is a tiny drop in it.

354
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:15,205
The more you grab, 
the more victorious you are.

355
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:18,151
Spread Friendship!

356
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,330
Spread Love!

357
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,610
Spread all the experience you gain. 
For our life is our own teacher.

358
00:32:27,174 --> 00:32:31,898
For there’s magic right in me, 
Everyone adores me a lot.

359
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:37,351
For there’s music in laughter, 
And everyone pays heed to it.

360
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:03,339
Sadness is no burden.. 
Nor is it everlasting.

361
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,868
Happiness too is inevitable.

362
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:14,106
Life is a mixture of bitterness and sweet. 
Tasting it is unavoidable.

363
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,625
This rhetoric will love on forever.

364
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:21,646
Spread Joy!

365
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:24,208
Spread Happiness!

366
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:27,028
Spread laughter to everyone.

367
00:33:27,053 --> 00:33:30,608
For this is the nature 
of extraordinary humans!

368
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:35,762
For there’s magic right in me, 
Everyone adores me a lot.

369
00:33:35,903 --> 00:33:40,622
For there’s music in laughter, 
And everyone pays heed to it.

370
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:53,145
Four years ago, Lakshmi sat right 
here and sang this song for us.

371
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:56,637
And today, you sang the same 
song and took us back in time.

372
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,729
But how did you sing 
that exact song?

373
00:34:01,754 --> 00:34:03,690
Last night, I heard 
something from the kitchen.

374
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:05,532
I went in to check.

375
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:08,314
A cat came out from the 
showroom next to the kitchen.

376
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:10,900
When I checked the 
showroom; I found the..

377
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:14,033
...piano, notes and the 
song among other things.

378
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:16,456
And when the same song 
as the notes from the room,..

379
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:19,456
...appeared in the video, 
I sang it for all of you.

380
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:23,606
I thought all of you would get 
angry and stop me from singing.

381
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:26,876
But all of you got so 
lost in the song, as if..

382
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:29,214
...she was right among you 
and all of you ate together.

383
00:34:29,613 --> 00:34:32,244
Are you that well versed 
with music to just take..

384
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:34,684
...a look at Lakshmi's 
notes and sing the song?

385
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,232
I worked at a church 
before I came here.

386
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,676
The Father of the church 
would play the piano.

387
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:44,082
He saw that I was interested in 
music, and taught me the piano.

388
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:47,341
After he passed 
away, I left the job.

389
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:52,689
Master, you remind 
me of the Father.

390
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:58,467
And I want you to be with 
me until my last breathe.

391
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:00,443
Damn the Grandpa 
made a commitment.

392
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:03,200
Only after my death, may 
you leave this house.

393
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,700
Take your words back! You 
think we'll let you go so soon?

394
00:35:07,082 --> 00:35:08,621
We'll make sure you live longer!

395
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:15,411
This woman just can't 
take her eyes off him!

396
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:17,310
Let's go.

397
00:35:18,161 --> 00:35:23,122
Look. Don't touch the piano again. 
Don't remind us of her.

398
00:35:23,147 --> 00:35:26,335
Put it where you found it. 
- Sure sir.

399
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,042
Master?

400
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:36,120
Without knowing about her, 
I managed to sing her song.

401
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:38,152
At least now, will you..

402
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,683
The one in the outhouse, 
is my granddaughter.

403
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,230
I had three sons and 
a daughter, Devaki.

404
00:35:47,751 --> 00:35:49,423
Her husband was Vasudeva!

405
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,376
Lakshmi was their daughter.

406
00:35:53,307 --> 00:35:58,213
My daughter and son-in-law 
passed away in a fire accident.

407
00:35:58,487 --> 00:36:02,328
Having witnessed it in 
real, the trauma destroyed..

408
00:36:02,353 --> 00:36:06,412
...my grand daughter 
and she's lost her mind.

409
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:11,352
Don't ever ask me anything 
that would remind me of them!

410
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:18,391
Mom! Pick the damn call!

411
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:22,416
Chetan! You told me that you'll be 
back in two days. It's been a week.

412
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:25,051
Where are you? Your 
father's scolding me here.

413
00:36:25,076 --> 00:36:26,137
Come back soon.

414
00:36:26,162 --> 00:36:28,977
Mom, didn't I tell you 
about my friend's wedding?

415
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:31,342
When one visits Goa, the trip 
is bound to get extended.

416
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:35,583
I've come to Bengaluru on a small job. 
And I’ll be back soon, okay?

417
00:36:35,608 --> 00:36:36,653
Okay. Take care.

418
00:36:37,388 --> 00:36:38,641
Mom!

419
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,516
You! Get out if you're 
going to be on your phone!

420
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:44,994
That is how it works here! 
- And if I talk in here?

421
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:48,064
I don't like it when someone 
disturbs me with noise.

422
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:50,447
So you don't like the noise, huh? 
- I don't!

423
00:36:51,323 --> 00:36:52,455
Guru! Let him go.

424
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,168
Does this noise work for you?

425
00:36:54,194 --> 00:36:56,178
They're drunk. Let go! 
- How dare you hit me!

426
00:36:56,202 --> 00:36:59,936
I'll teach you a lesson 
when you come to Mysuru!

427
00:37:12,743 --> 00:37:13,782
What's wrong with you?

428
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:15,063
Why do you sleep next to me?

429
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:17,042
On top of that you put 
your arms and legs on me!

430
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:21,350
The thing is.. I have a disease that 
makes me walk in my sleep at night.

431
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:25,248
If you have a disease, find another 
spot, why sleep next to me and bother me?

432
00:37:25,468 --> 00:37:31,195
I slept thinking of you. We 
work together all day and night.

433
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,545
Yet we sleep separately.

434
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:39,145
So only, my heart got 
me to sleep next to you.

435
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,317
Shall I?

436
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:43,768
Krishna? 
- Sit down!

437
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:46,784
Why the hell are you calling 
out Krishna in your sleep?

438
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:49,816
Since I was also thinking 
of Krishna all day..

439
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:54,598
I shall go wherever he is, 
tightly hug him and sleep.

440
00:37:54,623 --> 00:37:57,559
I have the same sleep 
walking disease!

441
00:37:57,584 --> 00:37:59,130
Since when did you 
get this disease?

442
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:03,353
Ever since you came and slept 
next to me, I got infected.

443
00:38:03,378 --> 00:38:05,769
This isn't a contagious disease.

444
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:15,370
What happened sis?

445
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:19,415
My laptop hung. I asked sister 
for help and she just walked away.

446
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,532
Is it a Mac book Pro?

447
00:38:20,557 --> 00:38:22,958
Do you know about Apple computers? 
- Type in the password.

448
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:26,118
Give it to me.

449
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:39,519
I was trying since so long. 
And you resolved it in a minute.

450
00:38:39,544 --> 00:38:41,238
That was great. 
- Thank you!

451
00:38:41,263 --> 00:38:43,759
Yesterday, 
uncle and I played video games.

452
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:46,144
He won all of them.

453
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:49,573
Come on! 
- Sister, he's right. Uncle's a hero!

454
00:38:49,754 --> 00:38:51,660
If he's a hero, what am I?

455
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:54,418
You..? You're a villain!

456
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:56,644
Run!

457
00:38:58,652 --> 00:39:00,635
Sir, who are you? 
- Who am I?

458
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:02,667
Who am I?

459
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:07,878
WHO AM I?

460
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:09,543
Why are you shouting?

461
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,191
How dare you come to my 
house and ask me who I am?

462
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,581
Who the hell are you?

463
00:39:13,606 --> 00:39:16,580
Look, please behave yourself 
- Why do I care?

464
00:39:16,682 --> 00:39:18,274
Who are you? 
- Chetu!

465
00:39:18,299 --> 00:39:20,917
You just entered the house and 
are already creating a ruckus!

466
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,940
Who is he to ask about me?

467
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:25,435
He's the new guy who'll 
take care of Grandpa.

468
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:29,309
Few days at work, and he's already 
a hero to all of you, is it?

469
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:31,172
You've been out since a week.

470
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:33,608
You'd no time for 
the event at home.

471
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:37,176
All you care is about your 
friends, pub and drinking.

472
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:38,902
How dare you come down 
and create a ruckus?

473
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:39,989
You useless brute! 
- Dad!

474
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:42,638
Don't scold me in 
front of strangers.

475
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,017
If only you had even an 
iota of goodness like..

476
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:47,271
...he does, you would be a 
better person in life.

477
00:39:47,296 --> 00:39:51,125
So that is why all you 
refer to him as a hero!

478
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:55,357
Is he an expert at 
taking care of you?

479
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:57,271
Shut your mouth! 
- Let it be master.

480
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:00,158
It's not fair to 
compare one another.

481
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:02,256
It'll only manifest 
their anger on us.

482
00:40:02,281 --> 00:40:05,388
There you go! The 
psychiatrist has spoken!

483
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:14,170
Hello? Please come.

484
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:15,850
What does he want from me?

485
00:40:16,072 --> 00:40:18,431
Fine! Damn this thing's blocking me!

486
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:20,034
Tell me what the matter is.

487
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:21,570
Heard that you sleep walk?

488
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:24,449
Excuse me. Talk to me. 
Since when do you sleep walk?

489
00:40:25,282 --> 00:40:26,790
Not like I was born with it.

490
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:29,821
Ever since I came to this 
house, I walk a bit in my sleep.

491
00:40:30,149 --> 00:40:32,683
And ever since the brat in 
this house hit me on my head..

492
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:35,304
...it has gotten frequent. 
But I'm glad I do.

493
00:40:35,973 --> 00:40:38,667
Move over. Let me tell you why.

494
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:40,441
What is it? 
- Close your eyes.

495
00:40:41,044 --> 00:40:42,832
How many fingers am I holding? 
- Two.

496
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,364
And now? 
- One.

497
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:45,529
Open your eyes.

498
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:50,834
How can anyone answer with their 
eyes closed? What a childish game!

499
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:52,796
So you can't see with your eyes closed? 
- Nope!

500
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:55,225
Then how do you sleep? 
- What sort of a question is that?

501
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,266
You close your eyes and go...

502
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,275
You can close your 
eyes and walk to the..

503
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,602
...right place next to 
the right person.

504
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:03,835
Yet you can't close your 
eyes and guess the number?

505
00:41:04,203 --> 00:41:06,539
Which means you don't 
really sleep walk.

506
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:11,320
Remember that everyone 
should respect women.

507
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:14,823
Just because they work with you, 
you think you can take them for granted?

508
00:41:15,338 --> 00:41:16,415
Careful!

509
00:41:31,729 --> 00:41:33,284
Wait a minute.

510
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:34,766
What are you doing here? Leave.

511
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,270
Your job is to take 
care of Master.

512
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,879
Hand me the tiffin box. 
Let me give it today.

513
00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:41,240
If they get to know that 
you're here, you're doomed.

514
00:41:41,386 --> 00:41:43,425
Don't worry. Everyone's asleep.

515
00:41:44,113 --> 00:41:45,715
Give me the tiffin box. Please?

516
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,049
Get a good look at this.

517
00:41:51,403 --> 00:41:54,767
I can bear this because I've been carrying 
her on my shoulders since she was six.

518
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:56,115
Can you bear it?

519
00:41:56,982 --> 00:42:01,022
And not just you, once Master was 
adamant about giving the food.

520
00:42:01,047 --> 00:42:03,108
Let me do it. 
- Master, please don't.

521
00:42:03,133 --> 00:42:05,085
He went in despite my warnings.

522
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,944
Master, listen to me! Please?

523
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,920
LAKSHMI: Who the hell are you?! 
- Lakshmi, listen to me. Don't do this.

524
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,873
LAKSHMI: Get out! 
GOPAL: Stop it! Listen..

525
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,296
Lakshmi!

526
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:17,927
Dad?! 
- Uncle!

527
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:21,264
What did you do to yourself, dad? 
Why are you here?

528
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,420
Don't we all love Lakshmi? 
- Not that we're heartless.

529
00:42:24,497 --> 00:42:27,559
We had to keep her here because she was 
reacting the same way at home, right?

530
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:32,186
I wonder how much longer we've 
to bear with God's punishment.

531
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,169
She takes over half an 
hour to eat a morsel.

532
00:42:35,911 --> 00:42:39,200
It takes almost three hours to feed 
her meal. Will you be able to do it?

533
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:40,810
Please leave.

534
00:42:41,232 --> 00:42:43,052
Oh my God! 
- Huh?

535
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:46,639
Krishna! Open the door! 
- Don't worry. I'll be fine.

536
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:48,178
Don't open the window 
from the inside.

537
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:14,118
If sound still interests you..

538
00:44:14,143 --> 00:44:16,883
...the rhythm in your 
body seems to be intact.

539
00:44:39,735 --> 00:44:45,490
Takita Takita.. 
This rhythm is melodious!

540
00:44:46,328 --> 00:44:52,020
Peeking through the window in 
search of you, came the moon.

541
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:58,988
Admiring your beauty, 
he couldn't help be wowed.

542
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:04,885
He descended from 
the sky just for you.

543
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:12,532
Takita Takita!

544
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:40,093
A fortunate moment has brought 
this divine bond together.

545
00:45:40,118 --> 00:45:46,386
My Dear.. May you be engulfed 
in eternal happiness.

546
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:53,171
May strings of 
happiness be yours..

547
00:45:53,196 --> 00:45:59,883
Keep stretching the bow 
of laughter on your lips.

548
00:45:59,908 --> 00:46:06,874
For once, pay heed 
to my request..

549
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:13,123
Go and live a life of comfort!

550
00:46:44,163 --> 00:46:52,552
Listening to the rhythm, the 
clouds slowly melted to rain down.

551
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:56,858
This is one such cheerful story.

552
00:46:57,202 --> 00:47:03,725
This ballad I now sing, 
is a serene journey.

553
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:09,968
Filled with rhythm and tempo, 
there's also a background score with it.

554
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:17,183
Why this loneliness, 
when your life can be musical?

555
00:47:18,095 --> 00:47:23,549
Highs and lows are 
common hurdles.

556
00:47:27,963 --> 00:47:33,585
Takita Takita.. 
This rhythm is melodious!

557
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:40,065
Peeking through the window in 
search of you, came the moon.

558
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:46,733
Admiring your beauty, 
he couldn't help be wowed.

559
00:47:47,662 --> 00:47:53,062
He descended from 
the sky just for you.

560
00:48:01,696 --> 00:48:02,743
What?

561
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:07,513
You managed to feed her 
in three minutes. But how?

562
00:48:07,746 --> 00:48:10,831
So you went to the outhouse 
and fed Lakshmi, huh?

563
00:48:10,856 --> 00:48:12,425
I'll get you into trouble now.

564
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:17,723
Master.. Any girl will get 
startled at the sound of thunder.

565
00:48:18,093 --> 00:48:20,288
But she pays attention to it.

566
00:48:20,562 --> 00:48:23,734
She looks for rhythm 
in the rattling windows.

567
00:48:23,993 --> 00:48:26,408
I used these sounds, 
sang to her while feeding her.

568
00:48:26,765 --> 00:48:29,609
Music continues to 
live in her heart.

569
00:48:30,555 --> 00:48:33,719
Being a music research student..

570
00:48:34,398 --> 00:48:37,468
Her aim was to build 
a music school and..

571
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:41,338
...she always dreamt of 
teaching music to poor children.

572
00:48:41,757 --> 00:48:44,720
When she was heading to 
New Delhi to take part in a..

573
00:48:44,745 --> 00:48:47,658
...National Level Music competition, 
the accident occurred.

574
00:48:47,946 --> 00:48:51,751
She forgot her dreams, 
forgot herself..

575
00:48:52,244 --> 00:48:53,454
...and forgot us all.

576
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:59,085
Even after consulting doctors at all 
the big hospitals, it was of no use.

577
00:48:59,624 --> 00:49:01,506
We got her admitted in a 
mental health hospital.

578
00:49:01,617 --> 00:49:03,831
When we visited her 
a few days later,..

579
00:49:03,856 --> 00:49:06,996
...Lakshmi's hands and 
legs were in shackles.

580
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:10,956
Why have you chained our child?

581
00:49:11,353 --> 00:49:14,251
Is this why you asked 
us not visit her?

582
00:49:14,276 --> 00:49:15,510
Sir, don't mistake us.

583
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:18,036
Two of our female wardens 
who tried controlling her..

584
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:20,427
...have suffered ligament 
tears in their hands and legs.

585
00:49:20,453 --> 00:49:23,609
We'll rather take her home instead 
of seeing her suffer like this.

586
00:49:23,634 --> 00:49:25,454
Discharge her immediately!

587
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:30,421
Unable to see her in that 
condition, we got her home.

588
00:49:31,671 --> 00:49:33,140
Master, don't mind me asking.

589
00:49:33,783 --> 00:49:37,666
All of you love her so 
much, then why the outhouse?

590
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:42,830
It was a treat to watch Lakshmi mesmerized 
while singing and praying to God.

591
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:47,766
After she came home, one day she saw the 
fire from the Pooja room and lost it.

592
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:51,573
She kicked the lamp, and created a 
ruckus almost putting everything on fire.

593
00:49:53,294 --> 00:49:54,988
Bhyraa get some 
water immediately!

594
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,884
Realizing that having her 
inside the house could..

595
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:00,223
...be dangerous to her, we 
moved her to the outhouse.

596
00:50:00,471 --> 00:50:02,885
On that day, I locked 
the God's room.

597
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:07,380
I vowed that if God does exist, 
and if he's indeed powerful,..

598
00:50:07,598 --> 00:50:12,155
I waited for him to cure Lakshmi 
and reopen the door by himself.

599
00:50:12,488 --> 00:50:17,855
Master, she will surely open the doors 
of the Pooja room and sing prayers to him.

600
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,081
You will witness it.

601
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:24,048
The very music that 
echoes in her heart..

602
00:50:26,032 --> 00:50:27,985
Will cure her to normalcy.

603
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:37,801
This is for him and this.. 
is for me!

604
00:50:38,324 --> 00:50:41,753
You think he can mess 
around with his senior?

605
00:50:41,778 --> 00:50:44,885
And you.. He thinks he's 
a big singer, doesn't he?

606
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:48,137
If he drinks this, his 
throat will be gone, forever.

607
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,871
Boss? Big Boss?!

608
00:50:51,897 --> 00:50:53,655
I'm right here. 
- Boss!

609
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,178
Boss, I looked for you 
all over the place!

610
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:59,311
My name's Krishna. 
No need to address me as boss!

611
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,678
Nah! That won't do boss! 
You are my boss!

612
00:51:01,703 --> 00:51:02,796
As you wish.

613
00:51:04,006 --> 00:51:07,022
What's this? 
- I've made Badam milk for you.

614
00:51:07,047 --> 00:51:08,417
Your dose of stamina!

615
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:12,382
Drink this and all your 
organs will work just fine!

616
00:51:12,407 --> 00:51:14,554
Is that so? Which one's mine?

617
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:16,415
This one's yours 
and this is mine.

618
00:51:16,878 --> 00:51:18,066
Why can't I drink this?

619
00:51:18,091 --> 00:51:20,934
What? No! 
- They both are Badam drink anyways.

620
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,933
If you exchange them, 
they're of the same colour.

621
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:25,833
Both are Badam drinks and 
are the same doses of stamina, right?

622
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:28,847
What has he done? 
- Fine! Take yours.

623
00:51:28,872 --> 00:51:32,302
Okay? Drink it! 
- Wait. Here..

624
00:51:32,815 --> 00:51:34,343
By the way, did you 
brush your teeth?

625
00:51:34,368 --> 00:51:37,134
No matter what doesn't 
get brushed in my body..

626
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:39,510
...my teeth surely get 
brushed four times a day.

627
00:51:39,535 --> 00:51:41,667
Any doubts? Smell it yourself!

628
00:51:55,621 --> 00:51:56,705
Shall I leave then?

629
00:52:00,653 --> 00:52:01,746
Everybody hurry up!

630
00:52:01,771 --> 00:52:03,747
We need to head to the 
groom's house for lunch!

631
00:52:03,772 --> 00:52:06,403
Meera! Quick, we're already late. 
- Coming.

632
00:52:09,779 --> 00:52:12,291
You think you can get 
away by complaining about..

633
00:52:12,316 --> 00:52:14,750
...Krishna going to the 
outhouse in sign language?

634
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:18,407
We're already late and 
you can't even speak up?

635
00:52:18,432 --> 00:52:20,619
It's late and no 
one's ready yet!

636
00:52:20,644 --> 00:52:22,205
What are you saying?

637
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:26,697
I'll fire you from your job. Idiot!

638
00:52:27,213 --> 00:52:29,728
There are kids in this house 
and what are you trying to show?

639
00:52:37,518 --> 00:52:40,234
Quit messing with me!

640
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:47,324
Whatever you wish to 
tell, won't happen.

641
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:49,016
You weren't here 
for the engagement.

642
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:52,651
I'm waiting right here by your car so 
that you don't miss out on the lunch.

643
00:52:52,676 --> 00:52:54,183
You think I'll miss this occasion?

644
00:52:56,085 --> 00:52:57,210
What is it?

645
00:52:59,735 --> 00:53:01,281
What are you blabbering?!

646
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,149
Where is he off to?

647
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,336
Wherever we're going.

648
00:53:08,827 --> 00:53:11,866
The groom's family has invited us. 
What work does he have there?

649
00:53:11,891 --> 00:53:13,024
I don't want him to come.

650
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:14,267
And if you still insist..

651
00:53:14,782 --> 00:53:16,422
If I still insist? 
- I won't come.

652
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:19,758
Master, I don't want you to 
miss out on this because of me.

653
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:22,133
All of you go ahead, 
I'll stay back.

654
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:25,054
If that's the case, you guys go ahead. 
I'll stay back.

655
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:26,835
Master.. Listen to me.

656
00:53:27,741 --> 00:53:28,750
Let's go.

657
00:53:29,218 --> 00:53:31,695
Let Grandpa stay back if 
he has chosen his side.

658
00:53:33,165 --> 00:53:35,470
Master! Why did you refuse to go?

659
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,705
Aren't you the 
head of the family?

660
00:53:38,024 --> 00:53:39,868
Your in-laws will 
be waiting for you.

661
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,946
Who told you that I'm not going?

662
00:53:43,424 --> 00:53:46,073
Are you going then? 
- WE are going!

663
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:48,094
But how?

664
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:52,375
This is my granddaughter's car.

665
00:53:54,032 --> 00:53:57,094
The car seems to be working fine, 
what will happen to her?

666
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,482
I'm already making it work.

667
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,208
Not everybody gets to visit their husband's 
house before the wedding. You're lucky.

668
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:09,749
Do you like this noise?

669
00:54:11,814 --> 00:54:14,086
He's my brother Chetan. 
- This is my son.

670
00:54:14,111 --> 00:54:15,610
Greetings!

671
00:54:20,171 --> 00:54:21,335
Looks like he's here.

672
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,569
After all, who is he? 
My father!

673
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:26,866
Krishna, join me inside.

674
00:54:26,891 --> 00:54:28,523
Master, you insisted, 
so I'm here.

675
00:54:28,695 --> 00:54:30,694
I don't want to come 
inside and hurt anyone.

676
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:31,993
You please go.

677
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:33,468
Greetings! 
- Greetings!

678
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:35,073
We were upset that 
you didn't join us.

679
00:54:35,098 --> 00:54:37,087
But we're happy now.

680
00:54:37,203 --> 00:54:39,321
Hello? Why can't 
you pick my calls?

681
00:54:39,835 --> 00:54:41,771
Remember the guy who 
beat you up at the bar?

682
00:54:41,796 --> 00:54:43,141
He's in our area now.

683
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:45,430
I saw him with my own eyes.

684
00:54:45,455 --> 00:54:47,174
He's here with his family.

685
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:48,657
Time to teach him a lesson.

686
00:54:48,682 --> 00:54:50,336
Get the boys along! 
I shall wait here!

687
00:54:51,296 --> 00:54:52,929
Krishna! Come here.

688
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:57,140
Here. Have it. 
- I'm fine Master.

689
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,149
There's a buffet waiting outside.

690
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:00,531
I didn't get you.

691
00:55:00,556 --> 00:55:02,783
Looks like our hero 
messed up with someone.

692
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,969
I'll look into it. 
You don't worry.

693
00:55:05,994 --> 00:55:07,907
You relax while I 
take care of it.

694
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:14,784
Where is he? 
- He's inside.

695
00:55:17,924 --> 00:55:19,213
Who is this guy?

696
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:25,540
One.. Two.. Three.. 
So there are nine of you.

697
00:55:25,564 --> 00:55:28,392
Looks like you've ganged 
up to beat our hero?!

698
00:55:28,417 --> 00:55:30,519
This is an internal matter.

699
00:55:30,544 --> 00:55:32,040
Do as you please 
when he's alone.

700
00:55:32,065 --> 00:55:34,158
But I won't let you touch 
him in front of his family.

701
00:55:34,183 --> 00:55:36,377
What will you do about it? 
- Oh, there’s a lot to do.

702
00:55:36,402 --> 00:55:38,759
What did you say? 
- Hold it! Let's toss the coin.

703
00:55:38,854 --> 00:55:39,946
There you go!

704
00:55:51,022 --> 00:55:52,569
Oh! I'll be back.

705
00:56:12,265 --> 00:56:13,851
Looks like he's an 
expert at this too!

706
00:56:24,855 --> 00:56:27,662
Did you get into trouble 
with someone off late?

707
00:56:28,027 --> 00:56:29,117
Not really!

708
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:32,867
There's a gang waiting 
outside for you.

709
00:56:33,805 --> 00:56:35,391
You can go upstairs 
and take a look.

710
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:34,471
I remember that guy who was actively 
doing all the work on that day.

711
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:37,839
You seem to have missed 
out on bringing him along.

712
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:41,414
That day, he took care of 
everything inside the house.

713
00:57:41,439 --> 00:57:43,758
Today he's handling 
everything outside the house.

714
00:57:47,405 --> 00:57:48,920
You asked him not to come.

715
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,812
And if he hadn't, you 
would've had it today.

716
00:57:53,364 --> 00:57:55,494
Phew! Lord help us!

717
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:59,457
By the time you take these women 
out and bring them back home..

718
00:57:59,482 --> 00:58:01,340
We would be done with 
four official meetings.

719
00:58:01,365 --> 00:58:05,043
My ears are still buzzing with 
all their chatter in the car.

720
00:58:05,068 --> 00:58:08,999
All men who make such statements, should 
be reborn as a woman in their next life.

721
00:58:09,024 --> 00:58:11,173
Only then will they realise 
the trouble we face.

722
00:58:11,198 --> 00:58:13,885
Bang on! I'll have a cup of coffee.

723
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:14,955
Okay sister.

724
00:58:16,111 --> 00:58:17,400
What is it?

725
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:22,922
Him and his sign language!

726
00:58:25,244 --> 00:58:28,353
My voice is back! 
My throat is fine!

727
00:58:29,408 --> 00:58:32,838
All those beatings from 
these men had no effect.

728
00:58:32,863 --> 00:58:36,214
One whack from the lady, 
and my voice is back.

729
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:41,371
Now I understand how men 
suffer in the hands of women.

730
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:42,607
Grandpa? 
- Huh?

731
00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:44,711
This one's for you. 
I chose it myself.

732
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:51,292
Father? Why do you seem upset?

733
00:58:51,317 --> 00:58:55,640
If Lakshmi was fine, she would 
have gotten married first, right?

734
00:58:56,918 --> 00:58:59,090
Master.. You're fretting 
about her all over again.

735
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:01,153
Six months from now, 
she'll get married too.

736
00:59:01,285 --> 00:59:03,035
You'll bless her 
with your own hands.

737
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:06,223
Who will even marry her?

738
00:59:06,248 --> 00:59:08,833
The one who understands 
her, will marry her.

739
00:59:08,858 --> 00:59:12,178
If your words come true, 
I'll give you a big reward.

740
00:59:12,203 --> 00:59:15,482
Yes! I'll leave this house 
only after I earn that reward.

741
00:59:15,507 --> 00:59:18,045
Keep watching! She'll 
get married for sure.

742
00:59:31,002 --> 00:59:33,862
Krishna? 
- Tell me madam.

743
00:59:34,134 --> 00:59:35,695
Take this. It's for you.

744
00:59:35,814 --> 00:59:38,392
Have you bought clothes for me? 
- Aren't you one among us now?

745
00:59:38,417 --> 00:59:41,869
Madam, can I ask you something 
if you promise not get offended?

746
00:59:42,135 --> 00:59:45,026
You bought clothes for everyone 
to wear at Sridevi's marriage.

747
00:59:45,735 --> 00:59:47,284
What about clothes for Lakshmi?

748
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:52,987
Clothes for Lakshmi? 
I don't know what to tell you.

749
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:56,983
Krishna? 
- Master..

750
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:02,538
Look at these clothes. 
They all belong to Lakshmi.

751
01:00:03,271 --> 01:00:05,271
She's not used even half of it.

752
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:08,037
My son-in-law Vasudeva..

753
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:13,201
Started a conglomerate called 
'Vasudeva Group of Companies'

754
01:00:13,841 --> 01:00:15,860
Business worth billions..

755
01:00:17,311 --> 01:00:22,827
Being born an orphan.. He wished to 
marry someone with a large family.

756
01:00:23,021 --> 01:00:25,373
And married my daughter, Devaki.

757
01:00:25,764 --> 01:00:31,013
After marrying her, he made all 
my sons quit their previous jobs..

758
01:00:31,038 --> 01:00:34,193
He took them in his company 
and made them as the Directors.

759
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:39,214
Today, my sons are running the 
very massive business he started.

760
01:00:39,966 --> 01:00:43,110
The 2,500 sovereign worth 
of gold he bought for Lakshmi,..

761
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,956
...continues to corrode 
in the bank lockers.

762
01:00:46,129 --> 01:00:51,074
If he was alive today, he would've 
taken lead and conducted the marriage.

763
01:00:51,099 --> 01:00:55,802
And here you are asking us to buy 
clothes to a billionaire's daughter.

764
01:00:55,827 --> 01:00:57,733
Master I didn't 
mean in that way.

765
01:00:58,111 --> 01:01:01,853
One might have a lot of 
clothes or jewellery..

766
01:01:02,263 --> 01:01:05,059
But the clothes we buy for an 
occasion is a special memory, right?

767
01:01:06,326 --> 01:01:09,303
Yes.. I agree.

768
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,383
But will she even understand 
why we're buying her clothes?

769
01:01:15,408 --> 01:01:18,047
Will she wear them 
and be at the wedding?

770
01:01:18,072 --> 01:01:19,766
I'll bring her along, Master.

771
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:23,523
Didn't we see a change in 
her when I was feeding her?

772
01:01:23,548 --> 01:01:24,760
This too will change.

773
01:01:25,002 --> 01:01:27,523
When you're with your 
family at a wedding..

774
01:01:27,548 --> 01:01:29,617
She will definitely 
respond positively.

775
01:01:30,156 --> 01:01:32,578
Trust me Master. 
Give me one chance.

776
01:01:32,603 --> 01:01:34,899
I will get her 
along with for sure.

777
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:37,672
Bring her Krishna.

778
01:01:45,398 --> 01:01:49,513
I know the trouble I go through 
while I bathe her once a week.

779
01:01:49,827 --> 01:01:51,374
You don't worry.

780
01:01:51,399 --> 01:01:54,328
Combing her hair isn't 
as easy as feeding her.

781
01:01:54,353 --> 01:01:55,509
Watch me do it.

782
01:01:56,101 --> 01:01:58,296
Hey Lakshmi! Good Morning.

783
01:01:58,835 --> 01:02:01,265
Look how scared she 
is of approaching you.

784
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:03,874
Do you like her or not?

785
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:08,084
I do. 
- Who is she?

786
01:02:09,984 --> 01:02:11,429
Mother!

787
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:15,913
Then who am I?

788
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,296
I don't.. Who are you?

789
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:19,726
A friend.

790
01:02:20,906 --> 01:02:22,977
Friend. 
- Yes!

791
01:02:23,141 --> 01:02:25,273
Okay. And now..

792
01:02:28,183 --> 01:02:30,931
Don't worry friend!

793
01:02:32,368 --> 01:02:35,508
I won't be combing your hair. 
Not yours at all..

794
01:02:35,533 --> 01:02:37,587
Do you see Lakshmi 
in the mirror?

795
01:02:37,612 --> 01:02:38,752
I'll comb her hair.

796
01:02:40,266 --> 01:02:43,375
I'll comb that Lakshmi's hairs. 
Not the one in front of the mirror.

797
01:02:43,454 --> 01:02:45,555
Is that okay?

798
01:02:47,812 --> 01:02:51,483
You see the Lakshmi in the mirror? 
- Yeah.

799
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:54,568
Will it look good on her if I 
part her hair in the middle?

800
01:02:55,328 --> 01:02:56,508
Or..?

801
01:02:57,078 --> 01:02:59,413
Will it look good if I 
lift the hair and tie it behind..

802
01:02:59,438 --> 01:03:01,320
...,without parting 
hair in the middle ?

803
01:03:05,235 --> 01:03:06,297
This is good. 
-

804
01:03:06,446 --> 01:03:09,726
As you wish!

805
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,283
Some mascara for Lakshmi..

806
01:03:12,618 --> 01:03:14,509
A coloured bindi for 
Lakshmi's forehead...

807
01:03:18,979 --> 01:03:22,162
Woah! Look at how good 
this Lakshmi looks..

808
01:03:22,187 --> 01:03:24,656
...when the Lakshmi in the 
mirror puts on some flowers?

809
01:04:13,303 --> 01:04:14,615
Is that Lakshmi?

810
01:04:16,983 --> 01:04:18,491
Be seated.

811
01:04:18,586 --> 01:04:21,382
Can't believe I ignored 
this beauty all this while!

812
01:04:46,455 --> 01:04:48,033
No!

813
01:04:58,605 --> 01:05:00,010
Don't!

814
01:05:00,824 --> 01:05:03,925
No! Don't!

815
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:05,051
Get that mad girl out!

816
01:05:05,136 --> 01:05:07,456
Bhyraa, bring her back.

817
01:05:07,481 --> 01:05:09,979
Who brought this mad 
girl to the wedding?

818
01:05:10,004 --> 01:05:12,855
Lakshmi! You'll be fine. 
Let's go.

819
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,973
Who brought this mad 
girl to the wedding?

820
01:05:15,106 --> 01:05:17,433
Speak up!

821
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,508
Somebody call up 
a mental hospital.

822
01:05:19,533 --> 01:05:21,396
Ask them to take her away.

823
01:05:21,673 --> 01:05:24,106
Lakshmi! Let's leave!

824
01:05:25,868 --> 01:05:28,253
Speak up! 
Who got the mad girl here?

825
01:05:30,142 --> 01:05:31,892
I was the one who got here here.

826
01:05:32,485 --> 01:05:35,587
She.. is my granddaughter.

827
01:05:35,876 --> 01:05:37,204
Dad..

828
01:05:38,251 --> 01:05:42,079
You never told us that there's 
a mad girl in your house!

829
01:05:42,552 --> 01:05:47,559
When we came to your house, 
you introduced everyone to us.

830
01:05:47,584 --> 01:05:49,632
Why did you hide this 
mad girl from us?

831
01:05:49,657 --> 01:05:52,534
Mr.Taptu. 
Don't mistake us.

832
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,896
We did this only because we 
didn't want to express our..

833
01:05:56,921 --> 01:06:01,247
...grief to you when an auspicious 
event was going on in the house.

834
01:06:01,272 --> 01:06:03,028
We didn't intend to 
hide it from you.

835
01:06:03,057 --> 01:06:06,557
Fine. I get that. 
But then we did meet again.

836
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:08,875
Your family came home for lunch.

837
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,610
You could've told us 
then, right?

838
01:06:11,392 --> 01:06:16,437
Is it right to have hidden the 
truth and arrange the marriage?

839
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:18,007
Sir..

840
01:06:19,623 --> 01:06:22,507
I'm not their relative, but I 
still have something to say.

841
01:06:22,957 --> 01:06:24,160
Forgive me for that.

842
01:06:25,004 --> 01:06:28,193
Mental imbalance 
isn't a birth defect

843
01:06:29,363 --> 01:06:30,772
It is caused by trauma.

844
01:06:31,636 --> 01:06:33,535
Instead of asking how 
all of their family..

845
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,240
...managed to smile with 
all this pain hidden..

846
01:06:36,949 --> 01:06:39,472
Is it right to ask why 
they hid it from you?

847
01:06:40,105 --> 01:06:42,675
A person suffering physical 
deficiency isn't necessarily unwell.

848
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,995
But the one who suffers from 
mental deficiency is unwell.

849
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:47,529
If you can't be 
compassionate, it's fine.

850
01:06:48,162 --> 01:06:50,185
But don't throw 
stones at their nest.

851
01:06:50,746 --> 01:06:52,937
Mr.Taptu, try to understand.

852
01:06:53,646 --> 01:06:56,310
Your grandson won't 
live in our house.

853
01:06:56,964 --> 01:07:01,574
But instead, our child will move to 
your house and bring in prosperity.

854
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,622
Nobody has to be worried.

855
01:07:05,757 --> 01:07:08,547
The mad girl you just saw, 
is my aunt's daughter.

856
01:07:09,828 --> 01:07:11,351
The girl I'm going to marry.

857
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:14,788
If her presence in our 
house bothers you so much..

858
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:17,742
I'll marry her tomorrow 
and move away with her.

859
01:07:18,647 --> 01:07:22,045
Please ask your son to tie 
the Mangalsutra to my sister.

860
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:29,325
Sir, I bow down to the 
unity of your family.

861
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:34,684
When a new guy is talking 
like he's one of your family member..

862
01:07:34,709 --> 01:07:37,936
It was wrong of me to have 
spoken like that. I apologise.

863
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:39,002
That's fine.

864
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:42,878
My son will not enter your 
house as an outsider..

865
01:07:42,903 --> 01:07:44,848
...but as one of 
your family members.

866
01:07:47,091 --> 01:07:48,415
Please continue with the rituals.

867
01:07:57,784 --> 01:08:00,057
Greetings! Welcome! 
- Greetings madam.

868
01:08:00,082 --> 01:08:01,639
May all of you be blessed.

869
01:08:01,664 --> 01:08:04,294
Master special wishes 
and prayers for you.

870
01:08:05,729 --> 01:08:09,471
We've forgotten all of it, and 
have become dependent on this.

871
01:08:09,496 --> 01:08:11,128
You.. Come closer!

872
01:08:11,755 --> 01:08:13,549
Whose horoscope am I 
supposed to look at?

873
01:08:13,574 --> 01:08:14,583
Lakshmi's horoscope.

874
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:17,446
Lakshmi's horoscope?!

875
01:08:17,471 --> 01:08:20,527
Don't worry. 
We wish to get her married.

876
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:24,255
Well.. The horoscope..

877
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,995
Let that be. Who's the groom?

878
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,269
It's our Chetan!

879
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:29,901
Chetan?!

880
01:08:31,392 --> 01:08:33,611
Are you planning to 
own all the wealth?

881
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:37,464
Are you hatching a plan to 
marry her for all her property?

882
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:38,972
Shut your mouth and do your job!

883
01:08:38,997 --> 01:08:41,823
If you screw around with the 
horoscope, I'll mess with your future.

884
01:08:41,848 --> 01:08:43,216
Are you threatening me?

885
01:08:43,241 --> 01:08:45,128
Watch what I do moron!

886
01:08:47,745 --> 01:08:50,152
Hand me the horoscope! 
- Here.

887
01:08:50,177 --> 01:08:51,972
Whose is this? 
- This is Lakshmi's

888
01:08:51,997 --> 01:08:53,972
Oh, is it?

889
01:08:54,011 --> 01:08:55,044
Wow.

890
01:08:56,292 --> 01:09:00,081
This is extraordinary. 
Her future seems bright.

891
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:01,808
You can get her married 
whenever you wish.

892
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:03,478
She'll have a 
happy married life.

893
01:09:03,503 --> 01:09:04,809
Master, 
there's nothing to worry.

894
01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:06,002
Go ahead and get her married.

895
01:09:06,027 --> 01:09:07,057
It'll be a happy ending.

896
01:09:07,082 --> 01:09:09,354
Please do select an auspicious 
date for the wedding.

897
01:09:09,379 --> 01:09:11,659
Am I not supposed to check 
the guy's horoscope too?

898
01:09:11,684 --> 01:09:14,417
I'm supposed to check this idiot's 
stars and planetary movements.

899
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:16,753
I'm an honoured astrologer 
of Master's family.

900
01:09:18,516 --> 01:09:21,008
Why are you groping my shoulders? 
Take it off?

901
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:23,210
Fine. Have fun. Give it to me.

902
01:09:23,235 --> 01:09:24,541
This is Chetan's horoscope.

903
01:09:24,566 --> 01:09:28,277
Oh, is it? His horoscope 
itself is crumpled.

904
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:32,109
The planets, moons and meteors 
are all in the wrong positions.

905
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:35,142
You moron. What are you doing?

906
01:09:37,351 --> 01:09:40,787
Why are you pointing a 
knife at my posterior?

907
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:44,260
I'll stab you right 
here if you mess around.

908
01:09:44,902 --> 01:09:46,019
Fine! I'll do as you say.

909
01:09:48,831 --> 01:09:52,827
Saturn has calmed down in the 
ninth house of his horoscope.

910
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,628
It's a perfect match.

911
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:57,011
You may get them married any day.

912
01:09:57,058 --> 01:10:00,144
Please go ahead and fix an 
auspicious day for the wedding.

913
01:10:00,169 --> 01:10:02,665
This entire week is auspicious. 
Be it day or night..

914
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:05,184
...you can get them 
married at any time.

915
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:07,129
Madam, here's her horoscope.

916
01:10:07,154 --> 01:10:09,162
And you boy, catch 
your horoscope.

917
01:10:09,187 --> 01:10:11,039
To hell with my 
horoscope and fate.

918
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:13,285
Master, I shall 
take your leave now.

919
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:15,995
Let me get out before he 
leaves a scar in my bum.

920
01:10:16,885 --> 01:10:19,895
Father, tell us when 
shall we get them engaged.

921
01:10:19,922 --> 01:10:23,323
Both of them are our children, what's 
the need for a separate engagement?

922
01:10:24,225 --> 01:10:27,034
This Friday, let's get them 
engaged at 7 A.M..

923
01:10:27,059 --> 01:10:29,601
...and go ahead with 
the marriage at 9 A.M.

924
01:10:30,677 --> 01:10:32,279
Great. 
- Let's go.

925
01:10:32,304 --> 01:10:33,748
Master? 
- Tell me, Krishna.

926
01:10:33,857 --> 01:10:35,529
Don't mistake me.

927
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:40,054
It's not good to get her married 
until she completely recovers.

928
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:42,507
What? You want her to recover? 
- Yes.

929
01:10:43,302 --> 01:10:47,734
If Lakshmi gets married in this condition, 
she'll remain the same all her life.

930
01:10:47,759 --> 01:10:50,913
Whether she recovers 
after the wedding or not..

931
01:10:50,938 --> 01:10:53,281
Who the hell are you to 
postpone this wedding?

932
01:10:53,306 --> 01:10:54,648
Look Krishna.

933
01:10:55,421 --> 01:10:57,695
This is our family's decision.

934
01:10:58,593 --> 01:10:59,890
Please don't interfere.

935
01:10:59,915 --> 01:11:03,577
It doesn't matter whether I 
belong to this house or not.

936
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:07,819
I'm confident that she'll 
completely recover in six months..

937
01:11:08,092 --> 01:11:09,403
Get her married then.

938
01:11:09,428 --> 01:11:11,967
Who do you think 
you are to cure her?

939
01:11:12,295 --> 01:11:15,420
You were a scum who roamed 
around begging for your life..

940
01:11:15,445 --> 01:11:17,640
With nowhere to go, you 
managed to plant yourself here.

941
01:11:17,665 --> 01:11:20,835
You're only Grandpa's caretaker, how dare 
you interfere in our familial matters?

942
01:11:20,907 --> 01:11:23,521
Who are you to cure her? Do you 
think you're a big psychiatrist?

943
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:24,639
Chetan!

944
01:11:25,349 --> 01:11:26,451
Don't you dare hit him!

945
01:11:26,476 --> 01:11:28,764
What else do you 
expect me to do?

946
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:31,826
Should I postpone my wedding 
just because he says so?

947
01:11:31,851 --> 01:11:35,271
How can you take his side 
and expect me to obey?

948
01:11:36,178 --> 01:11:37,522
Look Krishna!

949
01:11:38,654 --> 01:11:40,115
This marriage is a certainty.

950
01:11:40,556 --> 01:11:42,201
Nobody can stop this.

951
01:11:42,482 --> 01:11:45,716
My grandson will marry 
my granddaughter.

952
01:11:45,998 --> 01:11:48,943
Stop interfering in 
this matter from now.

953
01:11:49,693 --> 01:11:50,873
Everybody leave.

954
01:11:51,746 --> 01:11:53,246
Start preparing for the wedding.

955
01:11:57,287 --> 01:11:59,736
Master.. I have no intentions 
of stopping this marriage.

956
01:12:00,469 --> 01:12:02,294
My only wish is 
for her to recover.

957
01:12:02,646 --> 01:12:04,817
In a few days from now.. 
- Krishna?

958
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:08,103
If you really meant 
everything you spoke..

959
01:12:08,128 --> 01:12:10,533
...about our family at 
Sridevi's wedding.

960
01:12:10,884 --> 01:12:12,183
You may enter this room.

961
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,284
Or else.. Do as you please.

962
01:12:25,195 --> 01:12:27,571
Everything's happening as 
per your wishes, Krishna.

963
01:12:28,462 --> 01:12:33,733
You told me that someone who understands 
Lakshmi well, will marry her.

964
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:39,388
In her present condition, 
who other than Chetan will marry her?

965
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,340
Whatever happens.. 
Happens for the good.

966
01:13:03,203 --> 01:13:05,179
Hasn't Krishna showered yet?

967
01:13:08,647 --> 01:13:09,693
Sir?

968
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,369
Have you seen Krishna around?

969
01:13:11,394 --> 01:13:14,333
Your coffee's lying 
here since morning,

970
01:13:14,358 --> 01:13:16,226
Krishna never came 
to pick it up.

971
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:20,660
We want only two sarees each.. 
- Why two of them?

972
01:13:21,008 --> 01:13:24,975
I'm the groom's mother and 
the bride's aunt, right?

973
01:13:31,118 --> 01:13:33,789
What happened, Dad? 
- Krishna..

974
01:13:35,938 --> 01:13:37,315
...left this house.

975
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:39,033
Did Krishna leave the house?!

976
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:44,484
Master! Lakshmi's 
not in the outhouse.

977
01:13:44,509 --> 01:13:46,141
What? 
- I looked everywhere..

978
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:48,650
She's nowhere to be seen.

979
01:14:13,354 --> 01:14:15,111
If we post this online..

980
01:14:15,878 --> 01:14:19,947
When we visited the groom's house, 
you refused to come and took his side.

981
01:14:19,972 --> 01:14:22,205
And now? He's 
eloped with Lakshmi!

982
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:26,673
I constantly warned them not to 
employ him from the day he came along.

983
01:14:26,698 --> 01:14:29,844
Did anyone listen to me back then? 
Go on! Suffer now!

984
01:14:30,876 --> 01:14:33,048
We are worried ourselves, 
bugger off now!

985
01:14:33,073 --> 01:14:35,710
There's no point in worrying.

986
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:39,718
I've submitted the complete details about 
the car he took away, to the Commissioner.

987
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,960
He can't get out of the 
four southern states.

988
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:44,876
The police department will 
find him no matter where he is.

989
01:14:44,995 --> 01:14:46,548
I doubt that! 
- You!

990
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:13,385
When water can plummet down.. 
When a bird can fly away..

991
01:15:14,157 --> 01:15:16,233
When the sky can burn 
from the boiling sun..

992
01:15:16,258 --> 01:15:19,116
Why do you fear anything?

993
01:15:59,177 --> 01:16:03,825
Everyday, at dusk, 
the sun sets down.

994
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:08,923
With a smile he rises 
back, the next day.

995
01:16:09,728 --> 01:16:14,472
Though the moon and 
stars melt away,..

996
01:16:14,497 --> 01:16:19,467
...they rise above the horizon at 
dusk, to shine bright again.

997
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:24,633
It is natural for the heart to feel 
gloomy, and for the memories to haunt.

998
01:16:24,658 --> 01:16:28,332
To head towards the light, 
And witness the world shine.

999
01:16:28,357 --> 01:16:33,403
To face one's fear and emerge 
victorious is the ultimate bliss.

1000
01:16:36,501 --> 01:16:39,263
Keep marching without 
stumbling upon the hurdles.

1001
01:17:05,781 --> 01:17:10,813
Surging forward, the 
waves flow all day..

1002
01:17:10,838 --> 01:17:15,427
..and yet they progress, 
despite a fall.

1003
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:20,869
Come Rain, Come Shine.

1004
01:17:20,894 --> 01:17:25,757
Mother Earth never 
bows down to defeat.

1005
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:31,783
Put up against the mountains, the 
clouds will continue to graze past it.

1006
01:17:31,808 --> 01:17:36,316
To move past life's distressing 
times and fate's traps,..

1007
01:17:36,341 --> 01:17:40,318
...and to march against 
fear is the ultimate bliss!

1008
01:17:43,128 --> 01:17:45,646
Let go of fear, why 
be afraid anymore?

1009
01:17:56,762 --> 01:18:01,769
When water can plummet down.. 
When a bird can fly away..

1010
01:18:02,124 --> 01:18:04,755
When the sky can burn 
in the boiling sun.

1011
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,567
Why do you fear anything?

1012
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,016
I'm here!

1013
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:15,724
Come win over! 
Emerge victorious!

1014
01:19:18,686 --> 01:19:24,130
Come win over yourself!

1015
01:19:28,184 --> 01:19:32,599
No matter what happens to you!

1016
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:40,917
Even if the sky falls upon you!

1017
01:19:42,198 --> 01:19:45,597
Enlighten your trembling 
heart to stay strong!

1018
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,178
We have his visuals 
in this video.

1019
01:20:05,203 --> 01:20:09,346
I'll get it circulated on social media 
and get him here within 24 hours.

1020
01:20:18,548 --> 01:20:20,189
This camera might 
have caught his image.

1021
01:20:22,954 --> 01:20:24,532
He'll be seen now.

1022
01:20:24,566 --> 01:20:25,819
His face is not visible.

1023
01:20:25,852 --> 01:20:27,766
Look at him covering his 
face with the flowers.

1024
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:33,789
All we can see are his eyes.

1025
01:20:35,088 --> 01:20:36,930
He's covering his face 
with the coconuts.

1026
01:20:36,955 --> 01:20:38,417
Looks like he's 
planned it well.

1027
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:41,416
What a crook! 
- Forward it.

1028
01:20:44,565 --> 01:20:45,922
He's not shown 
his face anywhere.

1029
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:48,604
It all seems Pre-planned. 
He clearly walked in with a plan..

1030
01:20:48,629 --> 01:20:51,784
He didn't come to take care of father, 
he clearly intended to kidnap Lakshmi.

1031
01:20:51,809 --> 01:20:53,033
What a great actor he must be!

1032
01:20:53,058 --> 01:20:54,523
A brilliant actor indeed.

1033
01:20:54,548 --> 01:20:56,494
There's no way will we 
be able to catch him.

1034
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:58,174
Looks like your 
granddaughter is now his..

1035
01:20:58,222 --> 01:20:59,283
Grandpa!!

1036
01:20:59,353 --> 01:21:02,030
All of you might be 
feeling cheated by him..

1037
01:21:02,055 --> 01:21:03,538
But I'm sensing something else..

1038
01:21:03,718 --> 01:21:06,085
Gopi! I'm sure he'll get Lakshmi back

1039
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:07,138
Grandpa! Damn it!

1040
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:08,249
I doubt that.

1041
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,977
Krishna! You've 
eloped with a girl.

1042
01:21:13,002 --> 01:21:14,407
What's wrong with you?

1043
01:21:14,835 --> 01:21:16,741
My consciousness was killing me.

1044
01:21:17,758 --> 01:21:18,911
So I had to.

1045
01:21:19,329 --> 01:21:20,540
What do you mean?

1046
01:21:21,156 --> 01:21:23,039
I'm the reason behind 
her broken life.

1047
01:21:31,203 --> 01:21:32,992
Did you know her from before?

1048
01:21:33,017 --> 01:21:34,645
Don't ask me 
anything about that.

1049
01:21:34,785 --> 01:21:39,291
I have to get her to a music college 
and treat her with the help of music.

1050
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:40,737
That is my aim!

1051
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:42,801
You're not the one to 
take irrational decisions.

1052
01:21:42,903 --> 01:21:48,348
I'll pray to God that you cure 
her and get her back home.

1053
01:21:54,602 --> 01:21:57,302
I beg you! I'll fall to your feet! 
Let go of him!

1054
01:21:57,327 --> 01:21:58,850
Chetan! Stop it!

1055
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:00,227
Why are you beating him?

1056
01:22:00,252 --> 01:22:01,916
Who was responsible 
for Lakshmi's care?

1057
01:22:01,941 --> 01:22:04,264
Wasn't it his job? If he 
hadn't let Krishna inside..

1058
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:06,297
...the outhouse, would he 
have eloped with Lakshmi?

1059
01:22:06,322 --> 01:22:08,502
I'm responsible for Krishna 
to get close to Lakshmi.

1060
01:22:08,527 --> 01:22:10,596
If you feel like hitting me, go on! 
Take it!

1061
01:22:11,007 --> 01:22:13,789
I'm beating him because 
I can't do that to you!

1062
01:22:13,814 --> 01:22:16,485
Chetan! How dare you 
talk to him like that?

1063
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:19,470
For what he's done, don't 
you feel like scolding him?

1064
01:22:19,947 --> 01:22:23,712
Every one of you is unable to point out 
his stupidity and are keeping quiet!

1065
01:22:23,822 --> 01:22:27,078
Despite so many helpers in this 
house, did he need another caretaker?

1066
01:22:27,103 --> 01:22:28,485
Stop it!

1067
01:22:28,929 --> 01:22:30,601
Stop scolding Grandpa!

1068
01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:32,595
He'll definitely get Lakshmi!

1069
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,663
I doubt.

1070
01:22:33,688 --> 01:22:35,030
Father!

1071
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:38,273
Friend! I'm famished!

1072
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,670
Buy me food! 
- What? That's good!

1073
01:22:41,014 --> 01:22:44,623
If you're asking for food on 
you're own, I sense improvement.

1074
01:22:49,265 --> 01:22:50,635
Welcome sir! 
- What do you have?

1075
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:53,113
There's banana, buns and other fruits. 
- I'll take a pack of this.

1076
01:22:53,138 --> 01:22:54,200
Sure sir!

1077
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:56,926
Woah! Why are you rushing?

1078
01:22:57,497 --> 01:22:59,403
Are you happy? Good then!

1079
01:23:05,011 --> 01:23:07,533
How much is it? 
- Thirty.. Forty.

1080
01:23:07,713 --> 01:23:09,306
It's a Hundred and 
thirty in total.

1081
01:23:09,331 --> 01:23:11,072
Wait for me! 
- There's a forest ahead.

1082
01:23:11,097 --> 01:23:12,495
Make sure she 
steers clear of it.

1083
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,153
Okay! I will. 
Wait up Lakshmi!

1084
01:23:14,394 --> 01:23:17,486
Stop right there Lakshmi!

1085
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,282
Why did Gopi do this? 
I don't understand.

1086
01:23:24,313 --> 01:23:26,422
What happened? 
- I don't know anything.

1087
01:23:26,447 --> 01:23:27,978
He slept here last night.

1088
01:23:31,158 --> 01:23:33,056
You scared the 
daylight out of us!

1089
01:23:33,415 --> 01:23:35,977
What are you doing here? 
Please come home!

1090
01:23:36,002 --> 01:23:38,327
The kids are 
requesting you so much!

1091
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:39,389
I can't.

1092
01:23:40,744 --> 01:23:43,392
I have no face 
left to show them!

1093
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:46,494
I've no answers to my 
Grandson's questions.

1094
01:23:46,519 --> 01:23:48,306
He blurted something in anger.

1095
01:23:48,331 --> 01:23:49,721
No dear!

1096
01:23:50,667 --> 01:23:52,143
He was right.

1097
01:23:52,845 --> 01:23:55,384
I'm the one who's 
responsible for this mishap!

1098
01:23:56,189 --> 01:23:58,087
I trusted him completely.

1099
01:23:59,089 --> 01:24:01,843
Only to get hoodwinked by him! 
- Dad!

1100
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:03,811
How long will you stay here?

1101
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:05,627
Until Lakshmi is found!

1102
01:24:05,908 --> 01:24:07,791
Which means you'll 
be buried here.

1103
01:24:07,816 --> 01:24:09,119
Father! 
- Uncle!

1104
01:24:37,412 --> 01:24:39,351
Sir! Check out that car!

1105
01:24:39,376 --> 01:24:40,850
Head backwards.

1106
01:24:42,036 --> 01:24:45,679
We got a photo of a similar car from 
the Commissioner's office, right?

1107
01:24:45,704 --> 01:24:48,194
Yes sir! It's the same car! 
Check my phone.

1108
01:24:50,561 --> 01:24:52,890
Who came here in this car?

1109
01:24:53,195 --> 01:24:55,078
A guy had come 
along with a girl.

1110
01:24:55,251 --> 01:24:58,446
A girl? And was she..?

1111
01:24:58,471 --> 01:25:00,623
She seemed a bit different.

1112
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:04,224
Seemed different? 
Where did they go?

1113
01:25:04,249 --> 01:25:05,858
They went towards the forest.

1114
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:08,749
How long has it been? 
- It’s been almost two hours.

1115
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:30,594
I've got information that he's 
taken Lakshmi into the forest.

1116
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,410
Why did he take her 
into the forest?

1117
01:25:32,435 --> 01:25:35,058
To tell you that he's 
kidnapped your granddaughter..

1118
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:37,044
...and demand a ransom 
of One Crore rupees!

1119
01:25:37,069 --> 01:25:38,372
Can you keep quiet?

1120
01:25:38,748 --> 01:25:41,229
Police officials, forest 
officers have formed..

1121
01:25:41,254 --> 01:25:43,896
...a team and are searching 
across the forest.

1122
01:25:53,268 --> 01:25:55,680
What if he gets away from the 
forest before they get to him?

1123
01:25:55,705 --> 01:25:56,878
There's no chance.

1124
01:25:56,903 --> 01:26:00,801
Because Chetan has shared 
Lakshmi's pictures on social media.

1125
01:26:00,826 --> 01:26:05,580
Her pictures are being shared 
across the social media.

1126
01:26:05,605 --> 01:26:08,682
There's no way or chance 
for him to get away!

1127
01:26:08,707 --> 01:26:09,914
I doubt that!

1128
01:26:12,048 --> 01:26:13,844
Friend! Where are we?

1129
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:17,805
Who knows? I came behind you. 
But now I'm unable to find the way back.

1130
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:19,828
I'm unsure which way it is.

1131
01:26:24,828 --> 01:26:26,085
Let's go.

1132
01:26:26,886 --> 01:26:29,904
Oh my God! Where do I go now?

1133
01:26:32,984 --> 01:26:35,469
Nature is the right 
medicine for her.

1134
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:43,448
Sir, could anyone from your 
team have brought this in here?

1135
01:26:43,514 --> 01:26:45,723
Sorry sir! None of our 
officials eat inside a forest.

1136
01:26:46,981 --> 01:26:51,448
That means.. He must have 
got this from the tea shop.

1137
01:26:51,824 --> 01:26:55,301
So.. They must be close by.

1138
01:26:55,326 --> 01:26:57,426
Sir, this isn't a safe place.

1139
01:26:57,451 --> 01:26:59,592
Tigers, Lions and 
Leopards are found here.

1140
01:26:59,654 --> 01:27:02,731
There's a viewpoint 
on a hill close by.

1141
01:27:02,756 --> 01:27:05,355
We can view the entire forest 
from there and easily catch them.

1142
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:06,668
Let's go!

1143
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:12,689
No matter where they 
hide in the forest,..

1144
01:27:12,714 --> 01:27:14,323
...they can't get 
away from this camera.

1145
01:27:24,735 --> 01:27:25,815
Friend? 
- Tell me.

1146
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,188
Whose house is this?

1147
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:32,367
This house has been made by God 
for the Lions, Bears and Tigers.

1148
01:27:32,392 --> 01:27:34,111
Do they all stay together?

1149
01:27:34,136 --> 01:27:35,235
But how?

1150
01:27:35,932 --> 01:27:38,635
Just like how your Grandpa has 
managed to hold everyone together.

1151
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:40,675
Grandpa? Who? 
- Yeah.

1152
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:44,479
Who's that?

1153
01:27:44,504 --> 01:27:47,151
Your uncles, 
aunts and their children.

1154
01:27:47,176 --> 01:27:49,267
Your entire family.

1155
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:51,308
And your grandfather. 
Don't you recall?

1156
01:27:51,426 --> 01:27:53,768
I have no idea what 
you're talking about..

1157
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:38,971
Lakshmi! Where did she go?

1158
01:30:16,532 --> 01:30:17,649
Friend!

1159
01:30:18,852 --> 01:30:21,196
Let's go! 
Wait..

1160
01:30:23,181 --> 01:30:24,197
The cops are here!

1161
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,419
Sir, I see two people running!

1162
01:30:35,444 --> 01:30:36,860
Get closer to them!

1163
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:40,613
Go!

1164
01:30:43,824 --> 01:30:44,879
Sir..!

1165
01:30:45,883 --> 01:30:48,516
The trees are blocking our view. 
There's a thick forest ahead.

1166
01:30:49,368 --> 01:30:52,493
They have to get out from there. 
Keep following them.

1167
01:31:01,688 --> 01:31:03,099
There's a river ahead.

1168
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:05,201
I don't know where 
to look for them now!

1169
01:31:07,661 --> 01:31:10,747
Why are you heading back? 
Send it forward.

1170
01:31:10,772 --> 01:31:12,216
They have to get out of there.

1171
01:31:49,878 --> 01:31:51,214
I don't see anyone.

1172
01:32:09,353 --> 01:32:11,345
Sir, a tiger's been hurt.

1173
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:14,252
Damn it!

1174
01:32:19,379 --> 01:32:22,675
If he's managed to kill a 
tiger, he must be a genius!

1175
01:32:23,073 --> 01:32:25,792
Sir, he must be 
hiding in the forest.

1176
01:32:26,091 --> 01:32:28,286
Our surveillance cameras 
will catch hold of him and..

1177
01:32:28,311 --> 01:32:30,396
...we'll inform you as soon 
as we get hold of them.

1178
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:33,108
You please leave. 
Somebody inform the ambulance.

1179
01:32:33,418 --> 01:32:37,074
Disgusting. Can't believe 
the department hired you!

1180
01:32:45,982 --> 01:32:47,075
Help?!

1181
01:32:48,028 --> 01:32:49,137
Help?

1182
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:51,200
Hello!

1183
01:32:51,961 --> 01:32:54,458
Somebody help! 
- Baabanna!

1184
01:33:11,499 --> 01:33:13,692
She must have swallowed a lot of water. 
Please help her.

1185
01:33:14,127 --> 01:33:17,189
Who are you? 
- I'll tell you. Help her first.

1186
01:33:17,214 --> 01:33:18,778
Okay. Hold her straight!

1187
01:33:42,934 --> 01:33:44,911
Hello sir! 
The money you asked for.

1188
01:33:46,075 --> 01:33:48,497
Your laptop, clothes and 
surveillance cameras are here.

1189
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:50,437
There are also new clothes 
you asked for her.

1190
01:33:50,462 --> 01:33:54,070
On our way here, the cops checked 
our car for a mentally ill woman.

1191
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:56,193
It's not easy to 
get away on road.

1192
01:33:56,218 --> 01:33:57,893
It's risky. Please be careful.

1193
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:06,207
Hello? 
- This is Krishna here.

1194
01:34:06,232 --> 01:34:07,279
Is that really you?

1195
01:34:07,304 --> 01:34:08,443
How's Master doing now?

1196
01:34:08,468 --> 01:34:10,679
Chetan scolded 
Master recklessly.

1197
01:34:10,704 --> 01:34:11,898
Also he hit me.

1198
01:34:11,923 --> 01:34:13,701
A huge commotion took 
place in the house.

1199
01:34:13,823 --> 01:34:17,362
Unable to bear the brunt, 
he's staying at the outhouse.

1200
01:34:18,215 --> 01:34:23,277
If you don't bring Lakshmi back, 
I fear that it will affect his health.

1201
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:24,549
Where are you now?

1202
01:34:25,197 --> 01:34:26,505
Hello Krishna?!

1203
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:32,697
Is he the good guy? 
Or the bad guy?

1204
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:35,870
I just don't get it.

1205
01:34:38,749 --> 01:34:41,452
Name: Lakshmi. 
Age: 25!

1206
01:34:41,477 --> 01:34:42,836
Mentally ill patient.

1207
01:34:43,134 --> 01:34:46,485
If found, please contact 
the numbers provided below.

1208
01:35:04,101 --> 01:35:05,381
Move aside!

1209
01:35:14,093 --> 01:35:15,507
Hello? Take hold of this!

1210
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,724
Lakshmi! Get up!

1211
01:35:23,601 --> 01:35:25,844
Friend! I fell down. 
- You'll be fine Lakshmi.

1212
01:35:25,869 --> 01:35:26,907
Sorry!

1213
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:31,235
When the cops came by, why did you 
turn the boat around and make her fall?

1214
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:32,423
Don't mistake me.

1215
01:35:32,813 --> 01:35:35,477
Someone in her family doesn't 
want her to get cured.

1216
01:35:36,424 --> 01:35:39,250
They're trying to make sure 
she remains mentally unsound.

1217
01:35:39,689 --> 01:35:41,766
Therefore they've 
put up her picture on..

1218
01:35:41,791 --> 01:35:43,853
...social media and have 
complained to the cops.

1219
01:35:44,422 --> 01:35:47,500
Did he elope with Lakshmi? 
I knew it!

1220
01:35:47,525 --> 01:35:50,165
When I was examining Lakshmi's 
horoscope, I noticed him.

1221
01:35:50,192 --> 01:35:52,895
I knew he was up to something. 
And he showed his true face is it?

1222
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,490
Why didn't you tell us? 
- Chetan! What are you doing?

1223
01:35:55,515 --> 01:35:57,673
It's okay. He's a kid.

1224
01:35:57,698 --> 01:35:58,756
He didn't realise.

1225
01:35:58,781 --> 01:35:59,993
Astrologers are equal to Gods.

1226
01:36:00,018 --> 01:36:01,782
One shouldn't disrespect them.

1227
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:04,550
Forgive him. Will 
Lakshmi return home?

1228
01:36:05,083 --> 01:36:06,757
Please tell us what 
the future holds!

1229
01:36:06,782 --> 01:36:09,255
The planets and moons 
are not aligned.

1230
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,362
The Satan clearly 
wants to kick me.

1231
01:36:11,387 --> 01:36:12,393
What?!

1232
01:36:12,418 --> 01:36:15,676
I mean Saturn is staying on 
the right side of the path!

1233
01:36:15,701 --> 01:36:19,658
The chances of Lakshmi returning home.. 
are only 50%

1234
01:36:19,683 --> 01:36:22,016
Shastri sir, how do we 
increase the percentage?

1235
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:25,985
Everything is possible in Astrology. 
We can switch genders of a child.

1236
01:36:26,010 --> 01:36:28,078
We can bring a baby out, 
or even send it back in.

1237
01:36:28,103 --> 01:36:29,977
WHAT?! 
- Inside a house I mean.

1238
01:36:30,002 --> 01:36:35,119
Astrology has the power to 
seize all the properties.

1239
01:36:35,144 --> 01:36:40,041
But if you want 
Lakshmi to return..

1240
01:36:40,392 --> 01:36:43,966
For seven days, in the name of 
Lakshmi, we'll have to strictly..

1241
01:36:43,991 --> 01:36:45,979
Follow the 'Aham Bhanga Prayoga'.

1242
01:36:46,004 --> 01:36:48,910
We'll have to perform 
chants and rigorous rituals!

1243
01:36:48,935 --> 01:36:51,033
Please do it Guruji! 
Do everything you want.

1244
01:36:51,058 --> 01:36:52,625
I'm ready! 
- So?

1245
01:36:52,650 --> 01:36:54,848
But who's the groom? 
- He is!

1246
01:36:54,873 --> 01:36:55,989
Then he has to do them all!

1247
01:36:56,014 --> 01:36:59,442
He'll have to wake up in 
the Brahmi hour at 3:30 A.M..

1248
01:36:59,467 --> 01:37:01,924
...and bathe in cold water 
before he sits for the ritual.

1249
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:03,002
You mean I should do this?

1250
01:37:03,027 --> 01:37:04,840
Nah. I will perform the 
rituals and marry her!

1251
01:37:04,865 --> 01:37:06,341
Guruji! 
- Obviously you should!

1252
01:37:06,366 --> 01:37:07,646
Aren't you the groom?

1253
01:37:08,173 --> 01:37:11,342
At 3:30 A.M. 
After a cold shower, if you sit..

1254
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:14,684
...down for the prayers. 
Krishna will peacefully bring Lakshmi back.

1255
01:37:15,034 --> 01:37:19,138
Say he takes a piping hot 
shower with Lux soap..

1256
01:37:19,163 --> 01:37:23,177
From the rear end to his head, he 
will be burnt beyond recognition.

1257
01:37:23,202 --> 01:37:24,613
I won't let that happen.

1258
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:27,011
Not just cold water, I'll 
take bathe in Ice water.

1259
01:37:27,036 --> 01:37:28,357
I only want her 
to return Swamiji!

1260
01:37:28,382 --> 01:37:31,099
Will you follow my words? 
- He will!

1261
01:37:32,226 --> 01:37:33,823
Now he's on my turf.

1262
01:37:33,851 --> 01:37:40,121
Watch me strip you naked and 
make you sit on the tip of the Himalayas!

1263
01:37:40,432 --> 01:37:42,768
Two days ago, 
Krishna had called.

1264
01:37:42,793 --> 01:37:45,489
What did he say?! 
Where is he now?

1265
01:37:46,534 --> 01:37:48,519
He inquired about Master.

1266
01:37:49,448 --> 01:37:50,755
I told him what happened.

1267
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:53,300
Damn it! 
Where has he taken Lakshmi?

1268
01:37:54,019 --> 01:37:55,714
He didn't say 
anything about that.

1269
01:37:56,729 --> 01:37:58,815
I asked him. He 
disconnected the call.

1270
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:01,643
What took you so long to tell us? 
Give me your mobile phone!

1271
01:38:02,792 --> 01:38:04,933
What was the time when he 
called you two days ago?

1272
01:38:06,197 --> 01:38:08,965
At around 2:30 in the noon.

1273
01:38:11,432 --> 01:38:12,987
In the noon..

1274
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:16,120
At 2:30 P.M.

1275
01:39:07,348 --> 01:39:08,581
There he is!

1276
01:39:10,418 --> 01:39:11,846
Lakshmi! Stop there. 
- Friend!

1277
01:40:19,828 --> 01:40:20,867
Move it!

1278
01:40:21,598 --> 01:40:23,645
Is she there? 
- No sir!

1279
01:40:23,670 --> 01:40:25,279
Keep looking!

1280
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:46,413
Lakshmi! Let's get out of here..

1281
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:16,296
Let me go! I'm not here for you!

1282
01:41:19,153 --> 01:41:20,626
Today's your lucky day!

1283
01:41:20,970 --> 01:41:22,975
But I won't spare you!

1284
01:41:23,742 --> 01:41:25,642
He's not here for you.

1285
01:41:25,667 --> 01:41:26,796
He's here for me!

1286
01:41:28,367 --> 01:41:29,978
He's my relative, Bharath!

1287
01:41:30,913 --> 01:41:36,170
He mistook your presence on my 
boat and is here to kill me!

1288
01:41:36,195 --> 01:41:39,163
He knew you would tackle him along, 
so he got some men along with him.

1289
01:41:40,023 --> 01:41:42,109
Look.. Forgive me.

1290
01:41:42,458 --> 01:41:46,169
I thought you were here for the 
girl with me and hit all of you.

1291
01:41:46,833 --> 01:41:48,788
This girl is mentally ill.

1292
01:41:50,732 --> 01:41:53,523
She's helping me out.

1293
01:41:54,434 --> 01:41:56,082
Please don't doubt her.

1294
01:41:57,137 --> 01:42:01,343
If you still don't trust 
me, we will leave this boat.

1295
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:05,609
Take good care of them!

1296
01:42:07,290 --> 01:42:09,257
We should never let 
down those who trust us!

1297
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:11,922
I shall leave.

1298
01:42:20,241 --> 01:42:21,304
Grandpa!

1299
01:42:52,476 --> 01:42:56,850
Lord Krishna! Only you 
can protect my Lakshmi!

1300
01:42:58,359 --> 01:43:01,282
Four days ago, 
from this very number,..

1301
01:43:01,307 --> 01:43:03,292
...a person made a 
call to this phone.

1302
01:43:03,538 --> 01:43:05,762
We've received information 
from the Cyber crime branch.

1303
01:43:05,787 --> 01:43:07,440
Did he have a woman with him?

1304
01:43:07,465 --> 01:43:09,155
Do you have any idea who he was?

1305
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:11,172
Sir, you're right.

1306
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:13,686
But he seemed new to this town.

1307
01:43:13,998 --> 01:43:15,709
And there was no woman with him.

1308
01:43:18,108 --> 01:43:19,179
Sir..

1309
01:43:19,204 --> 01:43:23,383
All those who visit this 
place, stay in the house boats.

1310
01:43:23,408 --> 01:43:24,978
You might find him there.

1311
01:43:58,922 --> 01:44:02,547
Alibaba.. Alibaba! 
Here's some Toddy drink for you!

1312
01:44:02,572 --> 01:44:06,500
Come closer.. Come closer.. 
Come spread your nest and lay a trap!

1313
01:44:06,525 --> 01:44:09,750
Come on, it's time for some fun!

1314
01:44:09,775 --> 01:44:13,251
Son, will you become a drum beater?

1315
01:44:13,276 --> 01:44:17,405
Son, will you become a drum beater?

1316
01:44:25,307 --> 01:44:29,221
Uncle Khader! Uncle Ali!

1317
01:44:29,246 --> 01:44:33,106
Let's get together quick 
and sail the boats!

1318
01:44:49,343 --> 01:44:53,139
This one's a troublesome fish..

1319
01:44:53,164 --> 01:44:57,157
This won't fall for your hooks!

1320
01:45:01,102 --> 01:45:04,976
This one's a big slippery fish..

1321
01:45:05,001 --> 01:45:08,228
Your fishing nets 
just won't be enough.

1322
01:45:08,253 --> 01:45:12,181
Stay away.. Stay far away! 
Why are you in a hurry?

1323
01:45:12,206 --> 01:45:16,739
Stay away.. Stay far away! 
And son..

1324
01:45:16,764 --> 01:45:23,959
Son, will you become a drum beater?

1325
01:45:40,869 --> 01:45:44,881
To gauge what oyster 
holds what pearl..

1326
01:45:44,906 --> 01:45:48,884
Is an impossible task!

1327
01:45:52,561 --> 01:45:56,126
To find out what 
secret a woman holds..

1328
01:45:56,151 --> 01:45:59,529
Is a task no one takes up!

1329
01:45:59,844 --> 01:46:03,960
Quests and Expeditions 
are the missions of life..

1330
01:46:03,985 --> 01:46:07,297
New lessons and learning all around..  
 And son..

1331
01:46:07,326 --> 01:46:16,735
Son, will you become a drum beater?

1332
01:46:22,613 --> 01:46:26,091
Thanks a lot for saving 
us from the cops!

1333
01:46:26,683 --> 01:46:29,764
You got everyone 
together and helped us!

1334
01:46:29,789 --> 01:46:31,318
I shall always be 
grateful to you!

1335
01:46:35,311 --> 01:46:37,263
Something seems to be 
wrong with the fire..

1336
01:46:38,865 --> 01:46:43,395
Eww! It doesn't seem like 
you bathed in cold water.

1337
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:45,615
It was a hot shower then. 
Drat!

1338
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:50,132
You think you can fool me and 
take part in this pure ritual?!

1339
01:46:50,157 --> 01:46:52,835
I shall make sure your 
body temperature goes..

1340
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:54,995
...from 98 degree to 
119 degree Fahrenheit!

1341
01:46:55,551 --> 01:46:58,449
*INVOKES CURSE FROM THE GOD* 
- Mom!

1342
01:46:58,474 --> 01:47:00,989
Guruji! Please forgive him!

1343
01:47:01,284 --> 01:47:04,295
He's never taken 
bath in cold water.

1344
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,513
I was worried if he 
would catch cold,..

1345
01:47:06,538 --> 01:47:09,597
...and mixed a bit of hot water along. 
That was it!

1346
01:47:09,622 --> 01:47:13,712
Would you mix hot boiling 
water along with alcohol...

1347
01:47:13,737 --> 01:47:17,184
...instead of ice cubes 
and serve it someone?

1348
01:47:17,209 --> 01:47:19,787
Nope! Guruji knows it all!

1349
01:47:19,812 --> 01:47:22,474
'The Absolute Master', 
'The Ocean of Ancient Knowledge'..

1350
01:47:22,499 --> 01:47:25,184
'The Astrological Gem' are some of 
the titles bestowed upon me!

1351
01:47:25,209 --> 01:47:26,488
Feel free to keep those titles.

1352
01:47:26,513 --> 01:47:28,496
Just make sure my son 
gets Lakshmi back!

1353
01:47:30,002 --> 01:47:33,939
Nonsense! Why are you crackling 
like a brick in the smoke?

1354
01:47:34,229 --> 01:47:36,026
You want Lakshmi, right? 
- I do!

1355
01:47:36,051 --> 01:47:39,229
Then you'll have to stare right at the 
fire without breaking concentration!

1356
01:47:39,254 --> 01:47:41,544
If you don't, tears will 
flow from your eyes.

1357
01:47:41,569 --> 01:47:44,455
And they're no ordinary tears, 
they'll be tears of blood!

1358
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:47,455
You fool! 
- Do as he says. Stare into the fire!

1359
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,706
You'll have to stare into the 
fire with focus and dedication.

1360
01:47:50,731 --> 01:47:52,659
Do you understand? 
Take this!

1361
01:47:52,684 --> 01:47:54,417
May the rituals begin!

1362
01:48:21,377 --> 01:48:23,519
Didn't I tell you about 
the music college..

1363
01:48:23,544 --> 01:48:25,808
...students who come 
here every Sunday?

1364
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:27,347
You're lucky they're here today!

1365
01:48:54,063 --> 01:48:55,141
Follow them!

1366
01:48:56,645 --> 01:48:57,754
Come on! Quick!

1367
01:49:06,324 --> 01:49:10,582
Looks like God is leading us to 
the place we intend to reach!

1368
01:49:37,449 --> 01:49:38,491
Excuse me!

1369
01:49:39,277 --> 01:49:40,785
Which music college 
are you guys from?

1370
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:43,754
We're all students of 
Raaga Music college!

1371
01:49:44,362 --> 01:49:47,612
Music has caused 
a lot of miracles!

1372
01:49:47,885 --> 01:49:53,330
A lot of harsh personalities can be 
calmed down, and we've done it too.

1373
01:49:53,355 --> 01:50:00,796
But I'm not sure how to 
cure a mentally ill person.

1374
01:50:00,821 --> 01:50:04,692
Madam! I've managed to bring 
someone who had forgotten..

1375
01:50:04,717 --> 01:50:07,884
...herself, and was locked 
in a room till your doorstep.

1376
01:50:08,459 --> 01:50:11,255
Her aim was to achieve 
in the field of Music.

1377
01:50:12,166 --> 01:50:19,934
Your attempt to use her goal as a medicine 
to cure her, is very new and interesting.

1378
01:50:19,959 --> 01:50:21,099
Please bring her inside.

1379
01:50:22,958 --> 01:50:23,986
Hello?

1380
01:50:24,525 --> 01:50:25,690
Let's go! 
- This is a Veena!

1381
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:29,295
Name: Lakshmi.

1382
01:50:31,731 --> 01:50:33,223
Mentally ill patient.

1383
01:50:34,443 --> 01:50:36,013
If found, please contact..

1384
01:50:36,748 --> 01:50:38,286
Please be seated

1385
01:50:39,443 --> 01:50:41,115
Madam! She's Lakshmi!

1386
01:50:46,252 --> 01:50:47,635
Madam! Please don't.

1387
01:50:48,025 --> 01:50:50,149
I know who you're 
trying to call.

1388
01:50:50,174 --> 01:50:53,767
But before you do, 
please do read about me.

1389
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,455
Krishna@doc.com

1390
01:51:00,382 --> 01:51:01,663
Is that really you?

1391
01:51:02,163 --> 01:51:03,374
I'm sorry.

1392
01:51:04,977 --> 01:51:08,801
I now understand why 
you believed that music..

1393
01:51:08,826 --> 01:51:12,958
...instead of medicine, 
could cure her illness.

1394
01:51:13,544 --> 01:51:17,654
Only you can prescribe the 
musical therapy for her.

1395
01:51:18,662 --> 01:51:22,728
*RANDOM CHANTS*

1396
01:51:25,771 --> 01:51:28,560
You may now consume this!

1397
01:51:28,943 --> 01:51:30,894
Mom! What's this?

1398
01:51:30,919 --> 01:51:32,615
Do I have to eat 
from the ground?

1399
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:33,640
Ask him!

1400
01:51:33,665 --> 01:51:36,788
Would you like to have some Meat chops, 
Chaatna, Minced meatballs along with..

1401
01:51:36,813 --> 01:51:39,940
...some Hanumantu Biryani served in a 
silver plate and fed in a golden spoon?

1402
01:51:39,965 --> 01:51:41,354
That won't be necessary.

1403
01:51:41,379 --> 01:51:43,737
But won't eating that 
spoil his health?

1404
01:51:44,288 --> 01:51:47,218
You'll be cursed! 
What do you think of yourself?

1405
01:51:47,243 --> 01:51:49,383
What is this? 
Goddess Annapoorneshwari!

1406
01:51:49,408 --> 01:51:51,914
What do you think will happen 
if he eats this rice offering?

1407
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:55,110
We don't know! 
- Lakshmi will return by herself.

1408
01:51:55,135 --> 01:51:56,722
If he refuses to eat this..

1409
01:51:56,747 --> 01:52:01,244
Everyone in the house 
will puke your guts out!

1410
01:52:01,269 --> 01:52:03,222
Forgive us!

1411
01:52:03,247 --> 01:52:05,908
Not just sand, feel free to mix 
some powdered glass along with it!

1412
01:52:06,448 --> 01:52:07,510
Why not?

1413
01:52:07,535 --> 01:52:11,746
You morons! You deserve this!

1414
01:52:11,771 --> 01:52:15,005
Suffer for having given 
birth to a duffer like this!

1415
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:17,771
I will haunt you in all 
the next seven lives!

1416
01:52:17,796 --> 01:52:19,437
Shall we begin? 
- Please go ahead.

1417
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:22,019
Goddess Annapoorni, bless him.

1418
01:52:22,044 --> 01:52:24,676
And for now, 
accept this offering!

1419
01:52:26,903 --> 01:52:28,278
You've been blessed.

1420
01:52:29,590 --> 01:52:30,762
Please come along!

1421
01:52:31,482 --> 01:52:33,200
Wow!

1422
01:52:44,158 --> 01:52:45,307
It's a Piano!

1423
01:52:46,915 --> 01:52:48,837
My friend! Just for you..

1424
01:52:48,862 --> 01:52:51,830
Madam's students will 
play a unique track!

1425
01:52:51,855 --> 01:52:53,760
Shall we listen to them? 
Let's go.

1426
01:52:57,223 --> 01:52:58,324
Are you ready?

1427
01:54:43,675 --> 01:54:46,215
This was the change, 
I was looking for.

1428
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:47,284
Friend?

1429
01:54:48,369 --> 01:54:49,442
Superb.

1430
01:54:50,565 --> 01:54:52,644
Madam, 
your composition was beautiful.

1431
01:54:52,669 --> 01:54:54,128
Hats off to your students!

1432
01:54:54,192 --> 01:54:57,711
Seeing that rhythm and dance 
still remains inside her,..

1433
01:54:57,736 --> 01:55:01,192
I don't think you'll need to 
stay here for a lot of days.

1434
01:55:01,217 --> 01:55:02,260
I hope so madam.

1435
01:55:02,391 --> 01:55:05,750
There's another thing I want her 
to recall with the help of music.

1436
01:55:05,885 --> 01:55:10,431
If the students can compose for 
it, we can progress a step ahead.

1437
01:55:10,456 --> 01:55:12,705
Tell me what it is. 
I'll get it done.

1438
01:55:12,862 --> 01:55:18,161
You were my fostered parrot.. 
You were my adorable parrot..

1439
01:55:18,186 --> 01:55:19,405
Can't see him go through this.

1440
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:24,166
It pricked you as an eagle.. 
It pricked you as a nail in your foot..

1441
01:55:24,191 --> 01:55:27,358
Nobody in our dynasty had 
to undergo such sacrifices.

1442
01:55:27,383 --> 01:55:30,470
Nobody in your dynasty had 
pointed his feet at an astrologer.

1443
01:55:30,762 --> 01:55:34,591
What? You mean that's the 
reason he's doing all of this?

1444
01:55:34,616 --> 01:55:37,615
Does it mean he's 
avenging his anger?

1445
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,164
Look! 
Lakshmi's heading towards us!

1446
01:55:40,189 --> 01:55:41,621
Please join us lady!

1447
01:55:41,646 --> 01:55:44,725
That is no slipper of nails, 
it's a bed of flowers.

1448
01:55:44,875 --> 01:55:47,592
Please come! Everyone! 
Say your chants! Quick!

1449
01:55:47,617 --> 01:55:52,764
Jai Jai Ram! Please come Lakshmi!

1450
01:55:52,874 --> 01:55:55,702
Like you instructed, I've 
prepared my students.

1451
01:55:55,727 --> 01:55:56,913
They're ready.

1452
01:58:08,177 --> 01:58:09,332
Stop it!

1453
01:58:09,426 --> 01:58:11,903
Don't touch the instruments 
if you've no idea about Music.

1454
01:58:12,317 --> 01:58:13,653
Don't kill the music.

1455
01:58:13,678 --> 01:58:15,841
Who killed the music, huh?

1456
01:58:16,067 --> 01:58:17,098
Do you know that?

1457
01:58:17,123 --> 01:58:19,153
This is today's latest trend! 
Watch me!

1458
01:58:27,202 --> 01:58:28,281
Stop!

1459
01:58:29,281 --> 01:58:30,430
What do you want me to stop?

1460
01:58:30,455 --> 01:58:32,275
Do you know anything about music?

1461
01:58:33,132 --> 01:58:34,867
Just bragging about it won't do.

1462
01:58:34,892 --> 01:58:37,179
All you know is to 
listen to music.

1463
01:58:37,937 --> 01:58:40,218
What I'm playing is 
right, listen to it!

1464
01:59:00,389 --> 01:59:01,492
What was that?

1465
01:59:02,599 --> 01:59:04,904
I couldn't bear with 
whatever you played till now.

1466
01:59:05,289 --> 01:59:07,122
Such harsh notes! Why?

1467
01:59:07,147 --> 01:59:09,983
The sound of train, 
all the cacophony,..

1468
01:59:10,008 --> 01:59:11,988
Was all of it really 
meant to cure her?

1469
01:59:12,594 --> 01:59:14,797
Or was it to anger her more?

1470
01:59:14,822 --> 01:59:16,993
I don't get your 
behaviour at all.

1471
01:59:22,530 --> 01:59:23,929
What are you doing?

1472
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:26,922
A mentally ill patient is inside.

1473
01:59:27,163 --> 01:59:30,364
If she does something untoward, 
our institute will face the brunt.

1474
01:59:30,389 --> 01:59:31,421
Please let me go.

1475
01:59:32,147 --> 01:59:33,858
Let me go! 
She might..

1476
01:59:42,165 --> 01:59:44,696
You asked if I knew anything 
about music at all, right?

1477
01:59:45,095 --> 01:59:46,650
Here are some notes I composed.

1478
01:59:54,642 --> 01:59:58,900
You composed these notes to take part 
in the New Delhi competition, right?

1479
02:00:01,602 --> 02:00:03,743
Didn't you claim to 
know a lot about music?

1480
02:00:05,551 --> 02:00:06,676
Sing!

1481
02:00:32,298 --> 02:00:36,199
May this journey proceed..

1482
02:00:36,779 --> 02:00:40,842
Progress is the law of the land.

1483
02:00:41,404 --> 02:00:45,701
May this journey proceed..

1484
02:00:46,232 --> 02:00:50,373
Perseverance is 
the law of victory.

1485
02:00:50,707 --> 02:00:55,207
The earth and the sky are yours..

1486
02:00:55,232 --> 02:01:00,162
To rise and fly, 
fear won't do any good.

1487
02:01:00,638 --> 02:01:04,979
You are the best there is.. 
And who can ever equal you!

1488
02:01:12,003 --> 02:01:14,480
He sang my composition!

1489
02:01:28,978 --> 02:01:34,766
You played the instruments wrongly 
to anger her and ended up curing her.

1490
02:01:34,837 --> 02:01:35,891
Great.

1491
02:01:35,916 --> 02:01:38,673
Music managed to cure her illness.

1492
02:01:39,518 --> 02:01:43,459
But to get rid of her 
fear, and remind her..

1493
02:01:43,484 --> 02:01:47,052
...of her family, there's 
one ultimate test left.

1494
02:02:27,554 --> 02:02:28,598
Lakshmi!

1495
02:02:28,924 --> 02:02:29,926
Don't be scared.

1496
02:02:30,881 --> 02:02:32,051
Be brave!

1497
02:02:32,255 --> 02:02:33,426
Look over there!

1498
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:37,021
What happened in the 
train was an accident.

1499
02:02:37,505 --> 02:02:38,549
This is devotion.

1500
02:02:40,242 --> 02:02:41,335
Watch carefully.

1501
02:03:18,137 --> 02:03:19,434
Did anything happen to him?

1502
02:03:20,143 --> 02:03:22,982
Watch me do it! 
- Please don't.

1503
02:03:23,418 --> 02:03:25,996
If something happens to you.. 
- Nothing will. Watch me!

1504
02:03:26,021 --> 02:03:27,637
My friend! Don't!

1505
02:03:53,533 --> 02:03:54,549
Look here!

1506
02:03:55,173 --> 02:03:56,431
Don't I seem fine?

1507
02:03:57,659 --> 02:03:59,831
No! That's the power of the God.

1508
02:03:59,856 --> 02:04:01,512
You'll have to overcome 
the fear of fire!

1509
02:04:01,621 --> 02:04:03,765
You overcame it, right?

1510
02:04:25,821 --> 02:04:30,275
Now pray to God and light all 
the lamps around this temple.

1511
02:04:35,809 --> 02:04:40,019
May this journey proceed..

1512
02:04:40,459 --> 02:04:44,825
Progress is the law of the land.

1513
02:04:45,115 --> 02:04:49,600
May this journey proceed..

1514
02:04:49,803 --> 02:04:53,904
Perseverance is 
the law of victory.

1515
02:04:54,295 --> 02:04:58,990
The earth and the 
sky are yours..

1516
02:04:59,015 --> 02:05:03,858
To rise and fly, 
fear won't do any good.

1517
02:05:04,279 --> 02:05:08,248
You are the best there is.. 
And who can ever equal you!

1518
02:05:13,092 --> 02:05:14,131
Master!

1519
02:05:14,545 --> 02:05:15,632
Krishna's back.

1520
02:05:15,967 --> 02:05:18,037
Huh? 
- What did you do to Lakshmi?

1521
02:05:18,709 --> 02:05:21,076
Tell us! 
- Will you tell us or not?

1522
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:26,137
Do you know what sort of sacrificial 
rituals I had to endure because of you?

1523
02:05:26,279 --> 02:05:27,733
I wore slippers made of nails!

1524
02:05:27,758 --> 02:05:29,436
I ate the mud from the ground.

1525
02:05:29,507 --> 02:05:31,271
I won't spare you!

1526
02:05:33,035 --> 02:05:34,379
Let him go!

1527
02:05:34,847 --> 02:05:37,839
Will you still take his 
side and celebrate him?

1528
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:38,864
I won't!

1529
02:05:39,732 --> 02:05:41,248
Where is my granddaughter?

1530
02:05:41,724 --> 02:05:43,232
Where have you hidden her?

1531
02:05:46,295 --> 02:05:47,842
How much money do you want?

1532
02:05:48,466 --> 02:05:49,700
25 lakhs?!

1533
02:05:50,599 --> 02:05:51,958
50 lakhs?!

1534
02:05:52,435 --> 02:05:56,060
Take as much money as you want, 
but return my granddaughter to me.

1535
02:05:56,170 --> 02:05:59,217
Return my granddaughter to me!

1536
02:05:59,623 --> 02:06:07,130
KRISHNA!

1537
02:06:11,099 --> 02:06:16,646
KRISHNA!

1538
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:26,525
The Loved one of the Gopis!

1539
02:06:26,550 --> 02:06:29,080
Hey, Guardian of the Cows!

1540
02:06:29,105 --> 02:06:34,210
O' beloved butter thief.. 
Come by taking gentle steps..

1541
02:06:34,235 --> 02:06:38,177
Krishna, come by quickly!

1542
02:06:38,202 --> 02:06:44,539
O' Krishna, come by quickly!

1543
02:06:44,687 --> 02:06:48,570
Krishna, come by quickly!

1544
02:06:48,595 --> 02:06:54,837
O' Krishna, come by quickly!

1545
02:06:55,656 --> 02:06:58,326
The Protector of Cows!

1546
02:06:58,351 --> 02:07:00,767
The Loved one of the Gopis!

1547
02:07:00,792 --> 02:07:03,506
The toddler of Gokula!

1548
02:07:03,531 --> 02:07:05,806
Hey, Guardian of the Cows!

1549
02:07:05,831 --> 02:07:10,927
O' beloved butter thief.. 
Come by taking gentle steps..

1550
02:07:10,952 --> 02:07:21,286
Krishna, come by quickly!  
 O' Krishna, come by quickly!

1551
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,831
Lakshmi! 
- Grandpa?

1552
02:07:38,654 --> 02:07:40,881
Take Lakshmi to her room.

1553
02:07:40,906 --> 02:07:42,738
Okay Grandpa! 
Let's go Lakshmi!

1554
02:07:42,763 --> 02:07:43,794
Sister!

1555
02:07:46,445 --> 02:07:50,702
Krishna! You kept your words 
and returned my soul back to me!

1556
02:07:50,991 --> 02:07:53,607
Couldn't you have told us 
that you've cured her..

1557
02:07:53,632 --> 02:07:55,546
...before we 
could even hit you?

1558
02:07:55,804 --> 02:07:59,009
Master.. If I'd told you this before..

1559
02:07:59,921 --> 02:08:04,780
All the pain you suffered for the last 
three months wouldn't have left your mind.

1560
02:08:05,625 --> 02:08:09,391
That pain would've haunted 
you someday in the future.

1561
02:08:10,046 --> 02:08:12,437
Now that you slapped me, 
you've vented your anger out.

1562
02:08:12,525 --> 02:08:13,994
That pain has left you.

1563
02:08:14,033 --> 02:08:16,377
You speak like a psychiatrist.

1564
02:08:16,402 --> 02:08:18,970
No matter what. 
I seek forgiveness on..

1565
02:08:18,995 --> 02:08:20,987
...behalf of everyone for 
having hit you in haste.

1566
02:08:21,012 --> 02:08:23,182
Master! Please don't.

1567
02:08:23,666 --> 02:08:25,988
Now go ahead and 
conduct a grand wedding!

1568
02:08:27,433 --> 02:08:29,573
You heard him, right?

1569
02:08:29,604 --> 02:08:32,346
Let's begin with the 
wedding preparations.

1570
02:08:34,860 --> 02:08:37,614
What? You've arranged 
a marriage for me?

1571
02:08:37,639 --> 02:08:38,681
Yeah.

1572
02:08:39,297 --> 02:08:41,361
Who's the groom? 
- Post marriage..

1573
02:08:41,752 --> 02:08:44,122
If ever you develop 
differences, don't ever insult..

1574
02:08:44,147 --> 02:08:46,284
...her by reminding her 
that she was mentally ill.

1575
02:08:46,309 --> 02:08:47,421
Look there.

1576
02:08:48,703 --> 02:08:50,601
That's him! 
Are you okay with this?

1577
02:08:54,185 --> 02:08:55,364
Yes!

1578
02:09:22,375 --> 02:09:23,524
Sister?

1579
02:09:25,953 --> 02:09:27,773
Sridevi! 
- Hey!

1580
02:09:29,829 --> 02:09:33,375
I was watching your wedding 
video and here you are!

1581
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:38,900
We'd beeen to pray to Lord Krishna 
for your safe return at the Udupi temple!

1582
02:09:39,375 --> 02:09:41,383
Thanks to Lord Krishna, 
you came back safely.

1583
02:09:41,408 --> 02:09:45,146
Krishna is the reason 
behind my recovery.

1584
02:09:45,695 --> 02:09:48,453
Okay. Are you all alone? 
Where's your husband?

1585
02:09:48,478 --> 02:09:50,867
Not just my husband, my 
entire family's here.

1586
02:09:50,892 --> 02:09:52,782
Grandpa has ordered 
us all to live here..

1587
02:09:52,807 --> 02:09:54,740
...until your wedding 
with Chetan is over.

1588
02:10:02,556 --> 02:10:03,766
Chetan?

1589
02:10:10,287 --> 02:10:12,169
Has my marriage been 
arranged with Chetan?

1590
02:10:14,787 --> 02:10:16,131
What are you saying, Lakshmi?

1591
02:10:16,614 --> 02:10:19,582
We pointed Chetan out to 
you and you saw that too.

1592
02:10:19,967 --> 02:10:22,591
Only after you agreed that 
he understands you well,..

1593
02:10:22,616 --> 02:10:24,777
...did we start preparing 
for this wedding?

1594
02:10:25,944 --> 02:10:29,144
I didn't say yes to Chetan. 
But it was to Krishna.

1595
02:10:30,037 --> 02:10:31,147
Krishna?!

1596
02:10:31,172 --> 02:10:35,006
The very Krishna who 
cured me and got me back.

1597
02:10:36,794 --> 02:10:39,895
If I'm going to marry, it's 
going to be with Krishna.

1598
02:10:41,202 --> 02:10:42,665
Or else I won't ever marry!

1599
02:10:42,690 --> 02:10:44,069
I don't want a marriage!

1600
02:10:44,764 --> 02:10:48,102
I don't want to marry at all!

1601
02:10:48,127 --> 02:10:49,399
I don't want to marry at all!

1602
02:10:50,529 --> 02:10:53,514
I don't want it! 
I don't want to marry!

1603
02:10:53,539 --> 02:10:57,047
Lakshmi! 
- I don't want to marry!

1604
02:11:03,975 --> 02:11:05,998
Master! Lakshmi went 
back to the outhouse..

1605
02:11:06,023 --> 02:11:08,089
...and locked herself 
inside like before!

1606
02:11:10,518 --> 02:11:13,026
He took her away and 
changed her mind.

1607
02:11:13,051 --> 02:11:17,040
And in the end made her say it out 
loud that she wants to marry him.

1608
02:11:17,065 --> 02:11:18,688
What a player he is!

1609
02:11:19,571 --> 02:11:23,915
He knew he would be accused of this 
and left home yesterday itself.

1610
02:11:24,943 --> 02:11:27,224
What? Krishna went away?!

1611
02:11:27,249 --> 02:11:32,116
He came here, 
did what he had to do and left.

1612
02:11:33,104 --> 02:11:36,286
He had asked me not to 
reveal this until the end.

1613
02:11:37,698 --> 02:11:39,089
But..

1614
02:11:39,814 --> 02:11:41,825
It's time to tell you everything.

1615
02:11:42,547 --> 02:11:44,345
Lakshmi ended up being 
the reason for this.

1616
02:11:44,370 --> 02:11:47,330
So you knew about all of this? 
- I did!

1617
02:11:48,245 --> 02:11:51,120
Only after he requested me, 
did he come to this house.

1618
02:11:51,706 --> 02:11:56,042
For the last six months, he 
bore all the insult and yet..

1619
02:11:56,067 --> 02:12:00,784
...continued to do all the work. Do 
you even know who Krishna was?

1620
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:03,668
He's ten times wealthier 
than all of you!

1621
02:12:05,685 --> 02:12:10,051
He is the only son of Dr. Ram 
Kumar, the Chairman of..

1622
02:12:10,076 --> 02:12:13,964
...Shivaram group of hospitals, 
Dr.Shivarama Krishna.

1623
02:12:15,067 --> 02:12:17,567
He's one of the top 
psychiatrists in India.

1624
02:12:18,107 --> 02:12:21,138
Trika! This one reduces anxiety 
and lets you sleep well.

1625
02:12:22,598 --> 02:12:25,021
What was the reason for 
Krishna to work at our house?

1626
02:12:25,046 --> 02:12:28,082
The reason for Lakshmi to 
lose her mental balance..

1627
02:12:29,152 --> 02:12:30,214
Was him!

1628
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:36,644
When we were getting Lakshmi 
discharged from the mental hospital..

1629
02:12:36,669 --> 02:12:39,747
He was at the same 
hospital for some work.

1630
02:12:39,856 --> 02:12:44,323
Having seen Lakshmi's condition, 
he inquired about her with me.

1631
02:12:47,274 --> 02:12:50,011
I was in the same train that 
Lakshmi's parents were travelling in.

1632
02:12:50,337 --> 02:12:52,251
Devaki, is everything fine?

1633
02:12:52,276 --> 02:12:55,368
Nothing is fine! 
We're all sitting separately.

1634
02:12:55,532 --> 02:12:58,017
Did Lakshmi eat anything? 
- When would she do that?

1635
02:12:58,173 --> 02:13:01,257
Ever since she put on her headphones, 
she's immersed in her music.

1636
02:13:01,282 --> 02:13:03,274
I somehow managed to 
feed her two morsels.

1637
02:13:04,079 --> 02:13:08,000
This time, Lakshmi will ace the 
All India Music competition.

1638
02:13:08,490 --> 02:13:11,173
That was the first 
time I saw Lakshmi.

1639
02:13:12,471 --> 02:13:13,810
Has your seat been confirmed?

1640
02:13:13,893 --> 02:13:16,297
The berth hasn't been 
fixed, my seat is ready.

1641
02:13:16,322 --> 02:13:20,060
While one was immersed in music without 
paying heed to her surroundings..

1642
02:13:20,085 --> 02:13:22,463
And here was a couple struggling 
to be without each other.

1643
02:13:22,488 --> 02:13:25,302
I didn't want this family to 
get separated even for a night.

1644
02:13:25,327 --> 02:13:28,732
Sir.. Please take my seat. 
And let me take yours.

1645
02:13:28,757 --> 02:13:29,886
But why?

1646
02:13:29,911 --> 02:13:31,285
Don't worry. Please 
take this seat.

1647
02:13:32,923 --> 02:13:37,464
I gave them my berth, and left to 
another compartment with his RAC ticket.

1648
02:13:40,714 --> 02:13:42,128
You did a good deed, right?

1649
02:13:42,153 --> 02:13:44,230
How are you responsible 
for Lakshmi's accident?

1650
02:13:44,255 --> 02:13:47,196
The reason for it was a false 
accusation that my hospital had to face.

1651
02:13:47,924 --> 02:13:52,188
Three years ago, a nationally 
recognised powerful industrialist,..

1652
02:13:52,213 --> 02:13:56,130
...Chairman of JK Mines, Abhishek 
Agarwal got admitted to our hospital.

1653
02:13:59,930 --> 02:14:01,188
He passed away after four days.

1654
02:14:01,213 --> 02:14:03,342
Your hospital is being 
accused as the reason behind..

1655
02:14:03,367 --> 02:14:05,578
...Mr. Abhishek Agarwal's death. 
What's your response?

1656
02:14:05,603 --> 02:14:06,702
Not at all!

1657
02:14:06,727 --> 02:14:10,459
The media ganged up against my 
father and threw questions at him!

1658
02:14:10,484 --> 02:14:13,326
They maligned our 
hospital by accusing us of..

1659
02:14:13,351 --> 02:14:16,167
...carelessness that led 
to the VIP's death.

1660
02:14:16,192 --> 02:14:18,778
My father was very 
disturbed about it.

1661
02:14:19,029 --> 02:14:23,106
Certain political parties filed cases 
against us and got the CBI involved in it.

1662
02:14:23,396 --> 02:14:25,717
After this.. My father's 
health began to diminish.

1663
02:14:28,968 --> 02:14:33,632
To find out the truth, I checked 
the deceased VIP's report.

1664
02:14:33,657 --> 02:14:36,211
With his sugar level spiking at 
380, how could you suggest the..

1665
02:14:36,236 --> 02:14:39,280
...nutritionist to give the patient 
cashew, almonds and lots of sweets?

1666
02:14:39,305 --> 02:14:41,645
Sir, the patient's family 
claimed that it was..

1667
02:14:41,670 --> 02:14:44,052
...his regular diet and 
compelled us to follow it.

1668
02:14:44,077 --> 02:14:46,475
That's why we succumbed to their demands. 
- What rubbish!

1669
02:14:47,776 --> 02:14:49,903
The patient got admitted on 
the 29th of March, right?

1670
02:14:49,928 --> 02:14:52,276
I want to see the CCTV 
footage from that day.

1671
02:14:52,301 --> 02:14:54,824
Because of a server issue, 
the footage has been deleted.

1672
02:14:54,849 --> 02:14:59,301
Something seemed wrong when our 
own doctors were in their favour.

1673
02:14:59,326 --> 02:15:02,795
I doubted if the patient was hiding 
something when he got admitted..

1674
02:15:02,820 --> 02:15:06,756
...at our hospital, and went to 
the server room to check it.

1675
02:15:09,424 --> 02:15:13,628
Recover the deleted footage of 
the 29th of March from the server.

1676
02:15:14,207 --> 02:15:17,332
When I saw the footage, I realised 
that the VIP was already..

1677
02:15:17,357 --> 02:15:20,689
...weak when he entered the hospital 
and was entering into a Coma.

1678
02:15:20,714 --> 02:15:24,291
The partners of Abhishek Group 
of Company kept injecting..

1679
02:15:24,316 --> 02:15:27,829
...Mr. Abhishek with slow poison 
for the last eight months.

1680
02:15:28,176 --> 02:15:32,230
Every VIP who visited the patient 
were stopped from seeing him.

1681
02:15:32,559 --> 02:15:35,199
I learnt from my doctors 
that they'd taken..

1682
02:15:35,224 --> 02:15:38,232
...control over my hospital 
with the help of goons.

1683
02:15:38,544 --> 02:15:43,060
I decided to head to 
Delhi to submit all the..

1684
02:15:43,085 --> 02:15:47,900
...reports and CCTV footage 
of the VIP's admission to the CBI.

1685
02:15:49,968 --> 02:15:53,742
Krishna! They've learnt about your 
plan to hand evidence to the CBI.

1686
02:15:53,843 --> 02:15:57,311
Their men will be waiting for you at 
both Bengaluru and Delhi airports.

1687
02:15:57,578 --> 02:15:59,838
When they learnt that 
I'd not left by flight,..

1688
02:15:59,863 --> 02:16:02,043
...they came to the railway 
station in search of me.

1689
02:16:02,355 --> 02:16:05,128
Like you said, he's 
going by the train sir.

1690
02:16:05,153 --> 02:16:06,230
Finish him!

1691
02:16:09,568 --> 02:16:12,607
Assuming that it was me sleeping 
in the berth, they shot him.

1692
02:16:12,632 --> 02:16:14,864
They shot his wife 
who screamed for help.

1693
02:16:16,058 --> 02:16:18,861
If only I hadn't foregone 
my seat to Lakshmi's father.

1694
02:16:18,886 --> 02:16:21,027
The fire accident 
wouldn't have taken place.

1695
02:16:21,354 --> 02:16:24,178
The guilt that the danger 
that came my way ended..

1696
02:16:24,203 --> 02:16:26,967
...up destroying another 
family, kept haunting me.

1697
02:16:26,992 --> 02:16:29,029
She should've passed 
away along with them.

1698
02:16:29,358 --> 02:16:34,228
Since she was sleeping in the side 
berth, the other passengers saved her.

1699
02:16:34,630 --> 02:16:36,958
Sir! Can you do me a favour?

1700
02:16:37,060 --> 02:16:40,286
Tell me what can I do? 
- Take me to Lakshmi's house.

1701
02:16:40,683 --> 02:16:42,144
I'll make sure she recovers.

1702
02:16:43,388 --> 02:16:45,864
A doctor might cure 
thousands of patients.

1703
02:16:46,488 --> 02:16:49,714
But a doctor should never be the 
reason for someone becoming a patient.

1704
02:16:50,603 --> 02:16:53,094
Lakshmi's condition shouldn't 
return to what it was before.

1705
02:16:53,589 --> 02:16:55,597
I'll convince him 
and bring him back.

1706
02:16:58,556 --> 02:17:00,313
Greetings!

1707
02:17:00,338 --> 02:17:03,975
Are you Lakshmi's family? 
- Yes! We are.

1708
02:17:04,978 --> 02:17:07,907
The day he saw your 
granddaughter at the hospital.

1709
02:17:08,190 --> 02:17:10,126
He asked me to leave 
him alone for six month.

1710
02:17:10,237 --> 02:17:12,323
And that the girl was 
suffering because of him.

1711
02:17:12,348 --> 02:17:16,752
He felt that God wanted 
him to cure her and left..

1712
02:17:16,777 --> 02:17:21,090
...us telling that he won't 
contact me until then.

1713
02:17:21,115 --> 02:17:22,647
He returned only yesterday.

1714
02:17:23,598 --> 02:17:25,918
He expressed his happiness 
for having cured the..

1715
02:17:25,943 --> 02:17:28,584
...patient and handing 
her over to her family.

1716
02:17:28,609 --> 02:17:31,660
Krishna came to our house and 
lived like an ordinary helper..

1717
02:17:31,685 --> 02:17:35,154
...at our house without bothering 
about his reputation and wealth.

1718
02:17:35,179 --> 02:17:38,224
He left us without telling 
after curing our granddaughter.

1719
02:17:38,249 --> 02:17:40,677
After being with him all 
the while, my granddaughter..

1720
02:17:40,702 --> 02:17:42,828
...is now adamant about 
wanting Krishna in her life.

1721
02:17:42,853 --> 02:17:46,992
But he left to Europe last night 
for three months on a break.

1722
02:17:49,497 --> 02:17:51,656
He had a reason to come 
home the first time.

1723
02:17:51,916 --> 02:17:55,015
But now, he has to decide.

1724
02:17:55,405 --> 02:17:57,741
I'm not upset that 
Lakshmi said that!

1725
02:17:57,912 --> 02:18:02,084
Whatever is meant to happen in one's 
life, will happen no matter what, right?

1726
02:18:02,289 --> 02:18:04,046
It's enough if Lakshmi's happy.

1727
02:18:30,457 --> 02:18:31,567
Sir?

1728
02:18:31,910 --> 02:18:35,528
She's locked herself up in the outhouse 
since yesterday and isn't responding to us.

1729
02:18:41,081 --> 02:18:42,458
What did you do to Lakshmi?

1730
02:18:43,134 --> 02:18:44,908
Don't ever touch this piano again.

1731
02:19:29,703 --> 02:19:32,063
They might believe that you've 
gone back to your old self.

1732
02:19:32,088 --> 02:19:33,305
But I won't.

1733
02:19:34,248 --> 02:19:36,533
If at all you've become the 
person you were before,..

1734
02:19:36,807 --> 02:19:39,248
...it means that 
my treatment has failed.

1735
02:19:40,097 --> 02:19:44,172
None of my previously analysed 
treatments have failed.

1736
02:19:44,948 --> 02:19:46,321
Including this case.

1737
02:19:47,544 --> 02:19:49,935
I learnt that you aren't 
happy with the wedding..

1738
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:51,810
...your family has 
arranged for you.

1739
02:19:52,912 --> 02:19:54,052
Remember this.

1740
02:19:54,934 --> 02:19:57,452
Having been a mentally ill 
patient for three years,..

1741
02:19:57,477 --> 02:19:59,077
...you had no idea how you were.

1742
02:20:00,224 --> 02:20:05,196
But having been in this house 
for six months, everyday..

1743
02:20:05,221 --> 02:20:08,025
I've seen your 
family worry for you.

1744
02:20:08,050 --> 02:20:11,154
I've seen them lose their 
sleep and peace for you.

1745
02:20:12,378 --> 02:20:13,690
Do you know this?

1746
02:20:14,518 --> 02:20:18,056
Your grandpa's day begins 
with him taking a look at the..

1747
02:20:18,081 --> 02:20:21,590
...painting of your entire family 
which is just like a Banyan Tree.

1748
02:20:21,947 --> 02:20:25,463
He always desires to have his 
children and grandchildren around him.

1749
02:20:26,449 --> 02:20:30,197
He spends time everyday 
with his in-laws too.

1750
02:20:30,480 --> 02:20:33,838
In today's world, it's difficult 
to find a joint family.

1751
02:20:34,449 --> 02:20:38,644
Yet you have a family 
that always loves you.

1752
02:20:39,025 --> 02:20:42,494
But you wish to come along 
with someone who cured you.

1753
02:20:42,987 --> 02:20:44,339
I don't mind.

1754
02:20:45,073 --> 02:20:49,370
If you end up with someone like me 
who is constantly travelling, you'll..

1755
02:20:49,395 --> 02:20:53,846
...miss this house, the grandfather 
and this beautiful family, right?

1756
02:20:54,122 --> 02:20:55,236
Now you take a call.

1757
02:20:55,783 --> 02:20:58,002
Do you want me or do 
you want this family?

1758
02:20:58,927 --> 02:21:02,567
I don't wish to 
separate you from them.

1759
02:21:03,130 --> 02:21:06,096
A house with a united 
family, isn't just a house.

1760
02:21:06,722 --> 02:21:07,877
It's a nation in itself!

1761
02:21:25,706 --> 02:21:27,027
Friend?

1762
02:21:29,261 --> 02:21:30,385
Thanks.

1763
02:21:35,166 --> 02:21:36,237
Grandpa!

1764
02:21:37,752 --> 02:21:38,830
Lakshmi!

1765
02:21:54,969 --> 02:21:56,462
Driver! Let's go.

1766
02:22:00,672 --> 02:22:01,726
Friend?

1767
02:22:02,945 --> 02:22:04,036
Krishna?

1768
02:22:04,375 --> 02:22:05,513
Look over there.

1769
02:22:07,321 --> 02:22:08,474
Krishna!

1770
02:22:08,937 --> 02:22:12,132
You're not taking Lakshmi 
away from our family..

1771
02:22:12,157 --> 02:22:14,843
You've become one among 
our family today!

1772
02:22:17,446 --> 02:22:18,651
Take her along!

1773
02:22:19,251 --> 02:22:21,766
May you both live happily forever!

1774
02:22:22,227 --> 02:22:24,143
May you live long!Ayushman Bhava !
