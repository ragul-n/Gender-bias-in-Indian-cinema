1
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:34,619
Open Sesame

2
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,074
Close Sesame

3
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,374
Hamza, Zafar, scout ahead.

4
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:42,030
Then what happened Baba?

5
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:44,934
What else? The princess
is a princess after all.

6
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,837
She was adamant. The Vizier
tried to reason with her.

7
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:52,702
She said that she wouldn't
even drink a drop of water...

8
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:55,510
until she had avenged
her father's death.

9
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,916
In that blazing heat when even
the eagles would desert their eggs...

10
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:03,023
there she sat, thirsting
but not drinking.

11
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:06,889
Baba, this story of yours
makes me thirsty.

12
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:21,499
Bandits

13
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:23,474
Bandits!

14
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:26,570
The bandits! Run!

15
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:31,415
No! Don't run!
Hold your ground!

16
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,081
Don't run! Corral the camels.

17
00:06:15,964 --> 00:06:20,424
The bombs... give me the bombs.

18
00:07:26,935 --> 00:07:30,393
They have the magic!
The fires of the Satan!

19
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:36,400
They are raining the fire!
We can't fight them.

20
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:43,474
Then I must bring the Satan's fire
to serve me.

21
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:27,659
What Satan fears the fires of Satan?

22
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:31,723
Attack!

23
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:48,765
No! Don't kill my Baba!
(Baba = Father)

24
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,632
Where did your father find
the fires of the Satan?

25
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,737
It's gunpowder.

26
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:56,706
My Baba is the only one who knows
the secrets of gunpowder.

27
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:59,006
Don't kill him, please.

28
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:04,477
This is the soil from Satan's Hell.
Gunpowder. With its power, we could...

29
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:17,096
Help!

30
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:20,496
Help!

31
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:24,798
Qazi sahib!
(Qazi = Sheriff)

32
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,644
Please! Help me!
Someone help me!

33
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:36,114
I'm ruined!

34
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:57,432
Qazi Nuruddin at your service.
What is your plaint?

35
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:03,143
I've been ruined.
I had set out with my caravan.

36
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:07,938
They attacked all of a sudden!
All my men have been killed!

37
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:13,144
They looted everything!
I'm ruined!

38
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:14,915
Who were they?

39
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:19,425
That one-eyed Jack. The one who
holds all of Bahrestan to ransom!

40
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:22,792
Abu Hassan!

41
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:32,235
Do not cry.
I will help you.

42
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,275
Have this announced.

43
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:43,008
Hear one, hear all.

44
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:52,683
The Sultan of Bahrestan
and Qazi Nuruddin...

45
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,389
proclaim a reward of 10,00 Dinars
for the capture...

46
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:02,435
of Abu Hassan, the bandit,
dead or alive.

47
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:12,074
Good-for-nothing fellow!

48
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:15,444
Where the hell have you been?

49
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:19,553
I nearly died and went to Hell!

50
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:23,552
Blood? Whose blood is it?

51
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:26,250
The camel's.
- The camel's?

52
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:30,190
My dear brother, there's more to
the world than your bloody Dinars.

53
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:32,696
If it's on me, it could be
my blood, no?

54
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,461
Let me see.

55
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,398
It's a deep gash.

56
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:41,533
Amma...
(Amma = Mother)

57
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:42,905
Shut up.

58
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:46,144
What happened?

59
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:49,283
Your darling baby got into a fight.

60
00:13:52,954 --> 00:13:56,321
Allah! Look at all that blood!
The wound needs a dressing.

61
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:58,586
Else the wound could get worse.

62
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,523
Useless fellow!

63
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:05,555
Must you fool your brother?
This is insolence.

64
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,429
He was going to bash me up.
And that foul mouthing...

65
00:14:09,771 --> 00:14:13,502
He's your elder.
He's like a father to you.

66
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:19,142
No. No one can take the place of
my father. Not even my brother.

67
00:14:21,616 --> 00:14:26,576
I was so young when Baba went away.
I don't even remember his face.

68
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:36,123
I miss Baba. When I see this mark
of my father that I wear...

69
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:40,256
I wish I could be with Baba.

70
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:53,972
Yusuf Merchant, for folks at home,
having you back would be like...

71
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:58,050
celebrating the Idd.
- The moon that marks the Idd...

72
00:14:58,152 --> 00:15:00,382
comes once a year.
I'm going home after years.

73
00:15:00,521 --> 00:15:03,285
Why after so many years?
- For four years I have tried...

74
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:06,823
to make this crossing. But every time
the weather has been inclement.

75
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:09,523
Godspeed.

76
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:11,393
Aka...
(Aka = Uncle)

77
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:20,606
The sun is about to set. The men
are tired. Where do we pitch tents?

78
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:25,409
At the Oasis of Mercy
We are near the oasis now.

79
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,477
As you wish.

80
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:33,217
Ten more days this crossing
will take us.

81
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,718
There will be no more water
after this stop.

82
00:15:35,957 --> 00:15:40,155
The next watering will be at the dam
of the "Blossoming Gardens".

83
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:06,111
Happy tidings! My shop's fortunes
have changed!

84
00:16:06,354 --> 00:16:10,051
What can I offer you Bano?
(Bano = Lady)

85
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:13,889
I'm just taking a look.
- Sure. Take a good look.

86
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,357
You'll find pretty things here.
As pretty as you are.

87
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:18,833
These bladders...

88
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,266
What do these cost?
- Forget the price.

89
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:23,535
Take a look at it first.

90
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:26,063
Consider the shop
and the shopkeeper yours.

91
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:30,976
Two Dinars.

92
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:33,805
That's too much.

93
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:37,348
Too less, Bano. No one else
in town stocks this stuff.

94
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,008
Why not?

95
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:43,720
Haven't you heard about Abu Hassan?

96
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:46,787
He won't let a single caravan
reach Blossoming Gardens.

97
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,064
That is true.

98
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:54,000
All right give me twenty.

99
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:58,196
Never mind. Some other time.
- Take it.

100
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:04,238
A letter from Baba.
He's coming with his caravan.

101
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:05,877
He's bringing a lot of merchandise.

102
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:08,479
Show me. What does he write?

103
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:17,018
Lady, you bring us good luck.
I set my eyes on you...

104
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:20,092
and here I get news that
my father is headed home.

105
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:22,185
The next time you come,
I'll show you...

106
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,266
silks from Pataliputra, muslin from
Dhaka and lots more from Hindustan.

107
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:31,103
When is your father coming?

108
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:35,468
The caravan set out from Takshila on
the 15th day of the month of Moharram.

109
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:40,107
They will reach Blossoming Gardens
on the 11th of this month.

110
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:46,678
This is what you need
for the gunpowder.

111
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:49,514
May I see my father now?

112
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,390
Find out where they'll camp the night
before they reach Blossoming Gardens.

113
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:10,341
Fatima!

114
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,710
My child!

115
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:26,425
Don't weep my child, don't weep.

116
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:32,063
Those tears won't help us
break out of here.

117
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,927
But you could've escaped!
Why did you come back?

118
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:39,572
I couldn't desert you, Baba.

119
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:46,436
Had you escaped, you would've got
a chance to try and get me freed.

120
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:54,786
If they send you out again
to spy for them...

121
00:18:55,256 --> 00:19:00,421
make sure you get away.
Don't come back.

122
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:05,930
If I don't come back,
they will kill you.

123
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,637
I stay here as long as
you are here.

124
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:14,330
Old man, make sure the bombs
are ready by tomorrow.

125
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:18,308
Else, your daughter
is dead.

126
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:23,984
Must be a bad day for some
unfortunate caravan.

127
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:38,855
Everything is all right.
Let us rest.

128
00:19:57,251 --> 00:20:00,982
One of Yusuf Merchant's forefathers
built this dam.

129
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:04,953
This canal is the lifeline
for the Blossoming Gardens.

130
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:03,711
What goes on?
What are you doing?

131
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:07,586
Men, find out who
these people are.

132
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:23,628
Run!

133
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:32,368
Douse the fire!

134
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:20,822
Make sure the loot isn't
washed away with the corpses.

135
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:23,323
Don't worry, Sardar!
(Sardar = Captain)

136
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:48,316
I was going to give it
to you, Sardar!

137
00:22:48,556 --> 00:22:52,083
Or was it for your girl?

138
00:23:04,505 --> 00:23:07,565
The canal! The water is finished!

139
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:11,538
The water!
- Water!

140
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,840
Hear that? They say that
the water is finished!

141
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,098
Come on. Let's find out.

142
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:52,047
Qasim! Take a look here.
Could this be our Baba?

143
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:57,950
Thanks to The Lord,
he isn't.

144
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:04,955
I don't even remember
what Baba looks like.

145
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:08,533
Don't worry. Baba isn't
among the dead here.

146
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,438
Let's search once more.

147
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:13,540
Allah, please keep
our father safe!

148
00:24:18,846 --> 00:24:23,249
Could it be possible that
this isn't Baba's caravan?

149
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,717
Pray Allah, be it so!

150
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:46,536
Qazi sahib! My son is orphaned!

151
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:48,767
Give him to me.

152
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:54,142
People of the Blossoming Gardens,
you must have courage!

153
00:24:54,715 --> 00:24:56,307
Do not cry, my child.

154
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:59,509
Till such time that we have
the strength to fight...

155
00:24:59,753 --> 00:25:06,056
no Abu Hassan... no one in this world
can ever conquer us.

156
00:25:07,628 --> 00:25:10,825
He might have blown up the dam.
He might have destroyed our city.

157
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:15,128
But we won't let him make us die
of thirst. We will have wells dug.

158
00:25:15,636 --> 00:25:19,936
You will be able to buy water.
- What will the poor do, Qazi sahib?

159
00:25:20,507 --> 00:25:24,876
Why not petition the Badshah
to build the dam once again?

160
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:27,809
Come hell or high water...

161
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:30,380
What a shame!

162
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,986
The Badshah will never
build the dam.

163
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:38,221
That's because he can't
afford to build it.

164
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:41,394
Who is going to build the dam?
- We will. Together we can.

165
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:52,101
Remember, nothing can be done unless
the Badshah grants his permission.

166
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:05,017
Qasim!

167
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:06,983
What?

168
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:10,319
This is the stuff that you stock.

169
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:17,286
That girl! She bought it! She must be
with the bandits who blew up the dam!

170
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,600
Look! What a prize I've got us!

171
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:26,939
Come on...

172
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,536
Out of the way...

173
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:34,908
Don't touch her.

174
00:26:35,449 --> 00:26:37,747
Come on.

175
00:26:40,788 --> 00:26:42,255
Dance.

176
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:51,957
Dance!

177
00:27:15,889 --> 00:28:03,664
I'm a damsel,
a damsel...

178
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:18,748
So many lust after me, of all of them
who should I make my lover?

179
00:28:19,453 --> 00:28:34,699
I'm a damsel,
a damsel...

180
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:49,306
So many lust after me, of all of them
who should I make my lover?

181
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:57,819
I'm a damsel,
a damsel...

182
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:40,097
Who is he that I am crazy about?

183
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:47,397
Is he here, my darling?

184
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:54,739
Is it you? Is it you?
In who's eyes I've drowned...

185
00:29:54,915 --> 00:30:09,558
I'm a damsel,
a damsel...

186
00:30:29,516 --> 00:30:43,487
He who values my life the most
will be the one who can take it.

187
00:30:44,097 --> 00:30:51,560
Is it you? Is it you?
In who's eyes I've drowned...

188
00:30:51,738 --> 00:31:07,348
I'm a damsel,
a damsel...

189
00:31:37,851 --> 00:31:42,515
It's a woman who will destroy you.
Be warned.

190
00:31:42,656 --> 00:31:44,590
See with your own eyes
what goes on.

191
00:31:45,092 --> 00:31:48,186
You men will turn against you.

192
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:51,060
Stop them. Else, you are ruined.

193
00:31:57,137 --> 00:32:11,643
Either you say that, whom should I give a
chance, or I say whom do I want?

194
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:18,615
Is it you? Is it you?
In who's eyes I've drowned...

195
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:35,399
I'm a damsel,
a damsel...

196
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:47,350
So many lust after me, of all of them
who should I make my lover?

197
00:32:48,922 --> 00:33:22,645
I'm a damsel,
a damsel...

198
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:36,865
If you do this ever again,
I'll cut your throat.

199
00:33:39,304 --> 00:33:47,734
Fatima! Speak, my child.
What have the devils done to you?

200
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:58,651
I knew it. I knew those mongrels
would rape you someday.

201
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:06,293
Not yet. But I'll kill myself before
that happens. I have decided that.

202
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:16,468
What is it Baba?
What are you thinking about?

203
00:34:18,811 --> 00:34:22,474
There is only one way out.

204
00:34:26,985 --> 00:34:33,982
Keep this letter. Promise me you'll
open it after you're out of here.

205
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:38,320
But Baba...
- Give me your promise, my child.

206
00:34:38,797 --> 00:34:41,891
If that's what you want Baba,
I promise.

207
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:45,403
Fatima! My child!

208
00:35:07,526 --> 00:35:12,725
You mustn't mind this, Shamsher.
Now I happen to like you.

209
00:35:13,232 --> 00:35:16,497
But my daughter Morgiana
doesn't want to marry you.

210
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:19,531
And I won't force her into anything
she doesn't wish.

211
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:22,569
Think it over once again,
Your Majesty, lest...

212
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,300
What do you mean?
- That...

213
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:27,139
Your Majesty, there seems to be
a corpse lying over there.

214
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:33,676
Look into it.

215
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:39,319
Let it be. It's food
for the vultures.

216
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:41,187
He could be alive.

217
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:47,893
Forgive me for saying this.
Mercy is a weakness.

218
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:54,799
Maybe, for those who are my enemies.
My friends do not think so.

219
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,270
He's alive. Breathing.

220
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:00,573
Hear that? I was right.

221
00:36:02,648 --> 00:36:07,881
Your Majesty, it's rare for a king
to be mistaken.

222
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:13,748
For if kings were to make mistakes,
kings they wouldn't be.

223
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:25,260
Any chance he will survive?
- He will. But it'll take time.

224
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:27,598
He must have been in the water
for a long time.

225
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:33,841
Where did this pigeon come from?
- It was with him. A carrier pigeon.

226
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:36,704
A carrier pigeon?

227
00:36:37,082 --> 00:36:40,916
Then let the pigeon carry a message.
Write that he is my guest.

228
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:48,150
"But he is very weak and he is ill.
He cannot travel on his own."

229
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:53,128
"The Badshah wants someone from
his family to escort him home."

230
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,267
Thank The Lord for
keeping him alive!

231
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:00,434
Qasim...
- Yes, Amma?

232
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,233
You will set out at once
to bring your father home.

233
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,535
I?

234
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:06,473
Who else?

235
00:37:06,611 --> 00:37:09,808
I would've gone, Amma.

236
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:12,644
But there should be someone
to look after my shop.

237
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:15,049
Your shop means more to you
than your father?

238
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:21,159
Let him take care of his shop.
I'll go and get Baba.

239
00:37:23,729 --> 00:37:27,893
Bless you. Go at once.

240
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:31,165
But how am I to recognize Baba?

241
00:37:33,005 --> 00:37:37,965
This ring is an heirloom.
Your Baba wears one just like this.

242
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:52,285
Six days. If aren't back here before
sunset on the sixth day... with...

243
00:37:52,391 --> 00:37:55,883
with the gunpowder
and accessories...

244
00:37:56,028 --> 00:38:02,399
guess what will happen?
Your Baba will be killed.

245
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,590
"Fatima, my child: I am responsible
for whatever is happening to you."

246
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:33,195
"You are forced to serve these devils
to make sure they keep me alive."

247
00:38:33,632 --> 00:38:36,829
"Now no one can stop you
from escaping to freedom."

248
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:41,069
"By the time you've read this letter,
I will have killed myself."

249
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,168
"Forgive me, my child.
God bless you with a long life."

250
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:46,210
"Goodbye."

251
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:48,575
No!

252
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:39,853
Abu Hassan, I shall avenge
my father's death.

253
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:49,301
What are you thinking about?
Your next move? Or something else?

254
00:39:51,343 --> 00:39:56,872
There's still no reply
from Blossoming Gardens.

255
00:39:57,816 --> 00:40:01,718
If you would kindly let me,
Your Majesty, I'd leave directly.

256
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,882
Wait for a day or two.
If no one comes by then...

257
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:09,254
I'll have you escorted
back to Blossoming Gardens.

258
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:11,562
You are kind, Your Majesty.

259
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,527
Your move.

260
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,161
Check.

261
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:19,769
A revolt!

262
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:26,537
Your Majesty! There's a revolt!

263
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:28,506
Your Majesty...

264
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,810
At your service my Lord.

265
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:39,751
You?

266
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:49,564
If kings were to make mistakes,
kings they wouldn't be.

267
00:40:49,668 --> 00:40:52,569
Guards! Attack!

268
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:54,663
Yusuf, come with me.

269
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:11,449
Morgiana is in danger.
Take care of her, please.

270
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,718
Hurry!

271
00:41:33,745 --> 00:41:36,873
So the crown is mine.

272
00:41:37,082 --> 00:41:42,679
But I could spare your life, if you
gave your daughter in marriage to me.

273
00:41:43,021 --> 00:41:44,579
Never!

274
00:41:44,923 --> 00:41:46,652
Never?

275
00:41:47,058 --> 00:41:58,492
Never!
Bring me Princess Morgiana.

276
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:22,489
These people are after my life!
Please help me!

277
00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:23,923
Come on.

278
00:42:30,235 --> 00:42:31,862
After them!

279
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:37,029
You aren't hurt, are you?

280
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:41,399
Go on. I'll hold them.

281
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:51,301
How is my father?

282
00:45:54,806 --> 00:45:56,637
He was...

283
00:45:56,808 --> 00:45:58,742
What happened to him?

284
00:46:07,652 --> 00:46:11,452
Don't cry, my child.
Only the weak cry.

285
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:15,623
We must get out of here
as soon as we can.

286
00:46:18,463 --> 00:46:21,364
Come, we must find
a place to hide.

287
00:46:25,703 --> 00:46:27,762
Find her.

288
00:46:27,939 --> 00:46:30,567
Put the armies on the hunt.

289
00:46:30,742 --> 00:46:33,643
Announce a reward.

290
00:46:35,113 --> 00:46:40,551
I must have her.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

291
00:46:40,785 --> 00:46:44,346
And find the man who
helped Morgiana escape.

292
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:52,218
Your Majesty, I bear
the letter you sent me.

293
00:46:52,997 --> 00:46:59,334
I never write any letters.
Penmanship isn't my calling.

294
00:46:59,537 --> 00:47:01,505
I only know how to wield a sword.

295
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:03,163
Want to see?

296
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:07,209
There's more to statesmanship
than saber rattling, my Lord.

297
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:09,504
Maybe you could learn
the way of the words.

298
00:47:09,681 --> 00:47:11,444
This is insolence!
Who are you?

299
00:47:11,683 --> 00:47:14,777
I'm here to take my father back home.
His name is Yusuf Merchant.

300
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:19,115
Your father isn't in this world
anymore. He might be up there.

301
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,349
Throw him out.

302
00:47:22,994 --> 00:47:26,361
Is my father dead?

303
00:47:26,531 --> 00:47:30,558
Stop asking me questions. I'm not
a Prelector. I'm the Badshah.

304
00:47:30,768 --> 00:47:32,759
Throw this insolent fellow out. Out!

305
00:47:32,971 --> 00:47:36,498
Lord! Please! Please listen to me!

306
00:47:37,141 --> 00:47:40,008
Don't you ever show your face here.

307
00:47:45,817 --> 00:47:50,117
You must be knowing Yusuf Merchant,
right? He's my father.

308
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:54,223
He was the Badshah's guest.
Is he really dead?

309
00:47:56,294 --> 00:48:03,700
Shamsher has killed everyone
who was close to the last Badshah.

310
00:48:53,584 --> 00:48:57,577
You spy! I'll send you to your death!

311
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:05,022
Baba! What are you doing?
He saved my life.

312
00:49:05,897 --> 00:49:07,592
He did?

313
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:10,598
Then why was he coming in
like a thief?

314
00:49:10,835 --> 00:49:12,769
Did you expect me to come
with trumpets blaring?

315
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:15,429
Everyone in the city is looking
for your daughter.

316
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,208
My mistake. I took you for a spy.

317
00:49:20,445 --> 00:49:25,508
Forgive me, son.
- Please don't embarrass me.

318
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,218
If you're her father, you're
old enough to be my father too.

319
00:49:28,352 --> 00:49:31,651
She isn't my daughter.
She's the princess.

320
00:49:31,989 --> 00:49:35,516
But as of now, she's in my care.

321
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:39,761
It's dangerous for you here.
You must leave as soon as you can.

322
00:49:40,231 --> 00:49:45,100
You are right, son. Keep her company
till I return. Don't venture out.

323
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:49,296
I'll arrange for horses.
We leave at nightfall.

324
00:49:49,507 --> 00:49:54,103
Listen. The soldiers are everywhere.
They might recognize you.

325
00:49:54,278 --> 00:49:57,543
It could be dangerous for you.
I'll arrange for horses.

326
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:03,750
Allah sends us an angel.

327
00:50:03,888 --> 00:50:07,324
Who is he?
- I don't even know his name.

328
00:50:23,908 --> 00:50:27,400
Leave me!

329
00:50:36,621 --> 00:50:41,456
What happened?
Where's Morgiana?

330
00:50:43,394 --> 00:50:45,828
They took her.

331
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:54,904
Morgiana, if you knew my heart,
if you knew how much I love you!

332
00:50:55,173 --> 00:50:57,004
I hate you.

333
00:50:57,108 --> 00:50:59,838
Then you'll love me after
you've become my Queen.

334
00:51:00,011 --> 00:51:01,410
Never!

335
00:51:01,546 --> 00:51:03,980
Become the Queen you must!
For what would the people say?

336
00:51:04,182 --> 00:51:06,844
They will say that I did all this
murder and mayhem to grab the crown.

337
00:51:07,018 --> 00:51:09,145
My love for you
will be tainted, Morgiana.

338
00:51:09,287 --> 00:51:12,085
I'd rather kill myself!

339
00:51:12,256 --> 00:51:15,089
Not before I've stripped
you in public.

340
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:20,729
I'll make you dance before the men
who used to be your subjects.

341
00:51:21,098 --> 00:51:24,761
You cur! Your fed on the scraps
my father threw at you!

342
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:35,668
When the thong bites into the skin
the toughest will do the dance!

343
00:51:36,147 --> 00:51:37,808
Wait!

344
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:40,245
Tarry a while, Your Majesty!

345
00:51:42,787 --> 00:51:48,953
To make a beautiful girl dance,
you do not need a whip.

346
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,789
What you need is a wicked plot!

347
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:52,461
Understood?

348
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:56,157
She doesn't. But she will.
She will, Your Majesty, she will.

349
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,803
Who are you? How dare you enter
without permission?

350
00:52:01,005 --> 00:52:03,405
You do not know me, Your Majesty?

351
00:52:03,608 --> 00:52:11,105
I am the greatest of magicians!
I am the greatest of wizards!

352
00:52:11,415 --> 00:52:13,542
There's a dove!

353
00:52:15,553 --> 00:52:20,422
There goes the one bird in the hand!

354
00:52:20,658 --> 00:52:23,627
Can you bring this woman around?

355
00:52:23,761 --> 00:52:27,697
My magic has the power! I nod
at her, and she wags her tail!

356
00:52:27,832 --> 00:52:30,198
One wink at her, and
she comes into my arms.

357
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:34,065
And try as much as she might,
she will not escape my clutches!

358
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:38,766
Just give me your word, Your Majesty.
She will dance.

359
00:53:07,738 --> 00:53:15,838
The magician will do such a trick
that no one will believe it!

360
00:53:16,514 --> 00:53:21,076
Don't pout my trick, just dance for us,
or else...

361
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:31,593
The magician will do such a trick
that no one will believe it!

362
00:53:31,862 --> 00:53:35,992
Don't pout my trick, just dance for us,
or else...

363
00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:46,604
The magician will do such a trick
that no one will believe it!

364
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:13,467
Your lover will dance
and the whole world will see

365
00:54:13,671 --> 00:54:21,407
I control all the elements,
from water to fire!

366
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:30,444
Your lover will dance
and the whole world will see

367
00:54:30,921 --> 00:54:38,794
I control all the elements,
from water to fire!

368
00:54:39,397 --> 00:54:47,361
Come on my little dancer take these
anklets, just look at them and see...

369
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:56,412
The magician will do such a trick
that no one will believe it!

370
00:55:19,036 --> 00:55:27,375
Now I believe in you.
You are a crazy magician

371
00:55:27,545 --> 00:55:35,213
The way you turned me on
the whole world is amazed.

372
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:52,593
Now I believe in you.
You are one crazy magician

373
00:55:53,504 --> 00:56:01,036
The way you turned me on
the whole world is amazed.

374
00:56:02,246 --> 00:56:11,416
The magician will do such a trick
that no one will believe it!

375
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:37,144
It was a blessing of fate
that you had made me your trick

376
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:45,388
Just quietly dance till I say so.

377
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:54,520
It was a blessing of fate
that you had made me your trick

378
00:56:54,732 --> 00:57:03,037
Just quietly dance till I say so.

379
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:10,674
My head is at your feet, with you around
I fear no one, come what may.

380
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:20,255
The magician will do such a trick
that no one will believe it!

381
00:57:20,925 --> 00:57:27,330
Don't pout my trick, just dance for us,
or else...

382
00:57:27,565 --> 00:57:35,836
The magician will do such a trick
that no one will believe it!

383
00:58:08,894 --> 00:58:10,418
Come on Morgiana.

384
00:58:10,596 --> 00:58:13,326
They mustn't escape!

385
00:58:13,432 --> 00:58:15,093
Soldiers!

386
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:19,304
There's a caravan travelling to
Blossoming Gardens. Join the caravan.

387
00:58:19,472 --> 00:58:21,406
I'll join you after I've dealt
with the soldiers.

388
00:58:21,607 --> 00:58:25,600
No. You and Morgiana join the caravan.
I'll take care of the soldiers.

389
00:58:25,845 --> 00:58:28,439
You don't know the lay of the land.
You will get lost.

390
00:58:28,581 --> 00:58:30,549
Hurry. Join the caravan.

391
00:58:30,683 --> 00:58:32,776
Take care.

392
00:58:58,377 --> 00:59:01,244
One Dinar. Out with it.

393
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:04,871
If you can't pay for the water,
pray for it to rain.

394
00:59:05,117 --> 00:59:08,245
Look up at the sky, and don't you
forget to keep your mouth wide open.

395
00:59:10,623 --> 00:59:12,818
Give me a fill. Hurry.
- Right away.

396
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,170
Want a drink of water, Bano?

397
00:59:36,515 --> 00:59:41,817
You surely remember the day when
you bought the bladders from me?

398
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:44,716
So many others would have
bought bladders from you.

399
00:59:44,857 --> 00:59:48,418
But they use the bladders
to carry water.

400
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:52,622
Bladders aren't meant to be filled
with gunpowder to kill innocents.

401
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,322
What gunpowder?

402
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:55,728
You liar!

403
00:59:57,102 --> 00:59:59,400
You are the one who
blew up the dam.

404
00:59:59,538 --> 01:00:02,029
You are the one who is
forcing to buy water.

405
01:00:07,379 --> 01:00:10,473
You must be the one
who gives them the news!

406
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:13,882
I will hand you over
to the police!

407
01:00:14,019 --> 01:00:17,819
No! Don't! I am a victim
of Abu Hassan.

408
01:00:18,023 --> 01:00:20,685
He is responsible for
my father's death.

409
01:00:21,727 --> 01:00:22,955
Is that true?

410
01:00:23,095 --> 01:00:28,123
Yes. Oh how do I convince you?
I am not his accomplice.

411
01:00:28,267 --> 01:00:30,861
I was his prisoner.

412
01:00:31,637 --> 01:00:37,132
I was forced to obey him.
He held my father in a dungeon.

413
01:00:37,409 --> 01:00:42,472
Dungeon... Abu Hassan's?

414
01:00:45,084 --> 01:00:46,881
Do you know the way?

415
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:52,590
If you show me the way,
you are free.

416
01:00:54,827 --> 01:00:59,696
I know the area. But you will
have to find the entrance.

417
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:04,700
We will go immediately.
- No. Only after 6 days.

418
01:01:05,738 --> 01:01:08,070
The bandits will come for me
after six days.

419
01:01:08,274 --> 01:01:11,368
I hear the place is filled
with riches?

420
01:01:11,577 --> 01:01:14,569
For yours to keep.

421
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:18,113
All I want is Abu Hassan.

422
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:21,209
I want him dead!

423
01:01:37,102 --> 01:01:39,627
You must be the one!

424
01:01:39,872 --> 01:01:43,035
A soothsayer once told me that
my fortunes will change the day...

425
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:45,301
when the most beautiful of women
walks into my life!

426
01:01:45,477 --> 01:01:48,810
You must be the one!
Come, bring me luck!

427
01:01:49,848 --> 01:01:51,179
A soothsayer once told me...

428
01:01:51,283 --> 01:01:52,375
What?

429
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:55,577
That I'd meet a moron someday.
This must be the day.

430
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:05,889
Where are you sending the message?
- To Blossoming Gardens.

431
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:13,035
What have you written?

432
01:02:15,174 --> 01:02:19,270
I have asked them to be ready
to welcome a bride.

433
01:02:19,712 --> 01:02:22,909
I have asked for the roads
to be strewn with flowers...

434
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:26,212
and for the trees to be lit up
in the evening.

435
01:02:26,385 --> 01:02:28,683
And when the princess...

436
01:02:30,255 --> 01:02:32,485
When the princess
enters the city...

437
01:02:32,591 --> 01:02:36,118
she be welcomed with
the light of many moons.

438
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:54,536
Whose pigeon?

439
01:02:54,747 --> 01:02:57,409
There is only one man in the caravan
who is carrying pigeons.

440
01:02:58,717 --> 01:03:00,275
There he is.

441
01:03:00,452 --> 01:03:04,752
Your line of fortune is very bold.
You will find a treasure.

442
01:03:04,957 --> 01:03:07,585
Treasure?

443
01:03:07,893 --> 01:03:10,487
What bigger treasure
will I ever find?

444
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:15,029
I regret I have killed your pigeon.

445
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:19,532
You fool! I was sending
a message home.

446
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:22,538
Your message will not
reach the bandits.

447
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:25,836
What do you mean?
- I'll tell you.

448
01:03:26,045 --> 01:03:27,910
Tie him up.

449
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:33,246
Let him go! He's innocent.

450
01:03:33,419 --> 01:03:36,217
If you want him to live,
just marry me.

451
01:03:38,524 --> 01:03:40,992
Marry me.

452
01:03:41,593 --> 01:03:43,686
Say yes.

453
01:03:44,396 --> 01:03:46,387
Insolence!

454
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,496
Fire!

455
01:05:00,672 --> 01:05:04,108
Help!

456
01:05:07,513 --> 01:05:11,108
Get me out of here!

457
01:05:43,882 --> 01:05:45,645
Fraud!

458
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:52,950
Swine! Fight me if
you're man enough!

459
01:05:55,227 --> 01:05:58,788
You dare strike me?!

460
01:06:02,568 --> 01:06:04,195
Swine!

461
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:15,777
Yusuf! How dare you strike my man?

462
01:06:16,281 --> 01:06:21,150
This is my caravan.
And he's a spy for the bandits.

463
01:06:23,255 --> 01:06:28,522
He doesn't get a drop of water.
- I can vouch for him.

464
01:06:28,727 --> 01:06:32,527
And I know you too.
You're a thief. He isn't.

465
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:36,293
Let's see you stop me.

466
01:06:44,776 --> 01:06:46,243
Beware!

467
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:48,936
Drop the dagger.

468
01:06:49,314 --> 01:06:51,646
Well done, my child.

469
01:06:56,688 --> 01:06:58,485
Where did you find this ring?

470
01:07:02,127 --> 01:07:04,994
My mother gave it to me.

471
01:07:05,464 --> 01:07:07,796
It's a mark of my dead father.

472
01:07:09,501 --> 01:07:11,731
What's your name?

473
01:07:12,204 --> 01:07:15,071
Ali. Ali bin Yusuf.
(Ali, the son of Yusuf)

474
01:07:18,043 --> 01:07:20,238
Don't you recognize me?

475
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:23,438
I'm your father!
I'm Yusuf!

476
01:07:23,682 --> 01:07:31,680
Baba! You're alive!

477
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:38,728
My son!

478
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:53,036
Where's your ring?
- Abu Hassan looted us on the dam.

479
01:07:54,713 --> 01:07:56,271
No one moves!

480
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:01,014
Embrace your son, Yusuf.

481
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:08,590
You and your son go to hell.
And Morgiana becomes mine.

482
01:08:08,927 --> 01:08:10,861
Bandits!

483
01:08:59,745 --> 01:09:01,178
Run away!
I have to fight.

484
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:03,814
No! I'm not leaving you!
- Don't be adamant.

485
01:09:03,915 --> 01:09:05,109
Go away.
- But you?

486
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,877
Run!

487
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,368
Scoundrel! Leave me!

488
01:10:32,504 --> 01:10:33,801
Let go!

489
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:56,759
Go home. Take Morgiana with you.
Go to Blossoming Gardens.

490
01:11:00,065 --> 01:11:03,967
You're going to be all right, Baba.

491
01:11:04,102 --> 01:11:06,093
We'll go home together.

492
01:11:28,226 --> 01:11:29,523
What happened to him?

493
01:11:29,694 --> 01:11:30,661
What happened?

494
01:11:30,762 --> 01:11:32,696
Abu Hassan attacked us.

495
01:11:33,031 --> 01:11:34,794
I'll go and fetch the medicine man.

496
01:11:36,301 --> 01:11:42,137
No. Don't leave me now.
This is my last hour.

497
01:11:42,641 --> 01:11:47,374
Let me see all of you before I die.
- No! Don't say that!

498
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:53,868
Get water Hurry.

499
01:11:55,709 --> 01:11:57,870
Not a drop of water here.

500
01:11:58,112 --> 01:12:00,444
Go to the bazaar.
Buy the water.

501
01:12:01,448 --> 01:12:06,647
Is water being sold in my
Blossoming Gardens? Allah!

502
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:11,424
Here you are.
Rush home.

503
01:12:13,027 --> 01:12:15,962
Baba, drink some water.

504
01:12:16,096 --> 01:12:17,188
Take a drink, Baba.

505
01:12:17,364 --> 01:12:29,834
No. I'd rather die thirsting than
drink water that has been bought.

506
01:12:31,111 --> 01:12:33,102
Just one drink, Baba.

507
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:35,839
For my sake!

508
01:12:36,784 --> 01:12:44,816
Don't spare Abu Hassan.
For my sake.

509
01:12:44,959 --> 01:12:47,018
You will avenge my death.

510
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:48,753
And you will build
the dam once again.

511
01:12:48,896 --> 01:12:52,957
Yes, Baba. I will build the dam.

512
01:12:55,035 --> 01:12:59,597
Princess Morgiana was left to me
by my friend.

513
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:05,338
Promise me, you will find her.

514
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,509
Goodbye.

515
01:13:24,565 --> 01:13:29,662
The Badshah of Bahrestan had this
beautiful crown crafted...

516
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:34,432
for his successor. And to the
successor the crown has come.

517
01:13:34,608 --> 01:13:40,069
Abu Hassan is the Badshah of Bahrestan

518
01:13:40,414 --> 01:13:43,178
To Badshah Abu Hassan...
- Glory be!

519
01:13:49,957 --> 01:13:51,857
Glory to the Badshah of Bahrestan!

520
01:13:52,059 --> 01:13:54,084
Glory be!

521
01:13:56,196 --> 01:13:57,891
Now you should stake your claim
to the throne.

522
01:13:58,065 --> 01:13:59,760
Yes, you should.

523
01:14:02,002 --> 01:14:04,197
What are you waiting for?
Proclaim it.

524
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:07,864
No.

525
01:14:08,475 --> 01:14:10,602
It will never be.

526
01:14:12,146 --> 01:14:13,943
Abu Hassan

527
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:18,110
Abu Hassan will never
become the Badshah.

528
01:14:19,286 --> 01:14:21,379
Friends...

529
01:14:23,123 --> 01:14:27,321
It takes power to wrest a kingdom.
Wealth begets power.

530
01:14:27,561 --> 01:14:30,052
That power we would never have had
as long as I was merely a Qazi.

531
01:14:30,164 --> 01:14:32,132
That is why...

532
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:35,793
Abu Hassan was born.

533
01:14:36,003 --> 01:14:40,599
But a Badshah, I will become
in my own stead.

534
01:14:41,175 --> 01:14:44,008
As the Qazi of Blossoming Gardens.

535
01:14:46,113 --> 01:14:47,671
Long live

536
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:51,279
Long live the Qazi
of Blossoming Gardens!

537
01:15:00,327 --> 01:15:04,354
Long live the Qazi
of Blossoming Gardens!

538
01:15:23,984 --> 01:15:29,251
What if they don't come?
- They will. This is the sixth day.

539
01:15:31,892 --> 01:15:33,621
They are coming!

540
01:15:54,581 --> 01:15:57,880
Abu Hassan, I know that my father
has committed suicide.

541
01:15:58,252 --> 01:16:00,379
Still, I am leaving
this gunpowder for you.

542
01:16:00,554 --> 01:16:03,318
I hope you will give my father
a decent burial.

543
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:06,050
Don't try to find me: Fatima.

544
01:16:06,193 --> 01:16:07,922
The bird has flown.

545
01:16:08,095 --> 01:16:11,121
Let's take the horse back.
We must inform Abu Hassan.

546
01:16:28,449 --> 01:16:34,581
Abu Hassan and his men
won't survive the blast.

547
01:18:11,285 --> 01:18:13,048
The fire is spreading too fast.
I hope it doesn't get them...

548
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,017
before they have reached the cave.

549
01:18:51,358 --> 01:18:52,916
What do we do now?

550
01:18:53,026 --> 01:18:57,087
We have to work out a ploy
to set them after us.

551
01:18:57,264 --> 01:18:58,822
Why?

552
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:04,035
If we can capture even one of them,
finding the route won't be difficult.

553
01:19:06,907 --> 01:19:09,068
Friends...

554
01:19:09,276 --> 01:19:16,045
The first day of the New Year
is a happy day for all of us.

555
01:19:16,316 --> 01:19:22,744
Were the dam to have been built,
this would be a happy day indeed.

556
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:27,652
Worse, Abu Hassan is still alive.

557
01:19:27,928 --> 01:19:31,762
But, there is good news.
For today, water is free.

558
01:19:36,803 --> 01:19:41,968
A man gets only as much water
as he can drink.

559
01:19:46,246 --> 01:19:50,012
Why are you giving water free?

560
01:19:50,183 --> 01:19:55,621
The war for the throne of Bahrestan
draws near. I need support.

561
01:20:02,896 --> 01:20:06,696
You can take only as much water
as you can carry.

562
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,164
Let me help you, my sister.

563
01:20:11,338 --> 01:20:15,832
No! But you are the Qazi!
How can you carry my burden?

564
01:20:16,843 --> 01:20:18,743
Why not?

565
01:20:20,213 --> 01:20:24,775
The ruler bears all the burdens.
This is just a bladder of water.

566
01:20:24,951 --> 01:20:27,112
If only I could carry
all the bladders...

567
01:20:27,254 --> 01:20:28,516
for the people of
Blossoming Gardens.

568
01:20:28,722 --> 01:20:30,553
To the Qazi of Blossoming Gardens...
- Glory be!

569
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:33,159
Where is your house?

570
01:20:34,094 --> 01:20:36,426
Alibaba, your mother...

571
01:20:36,863 --> 01:20:39,832
My son, Alibaba.

572
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:44,497
But my Lord, this is the job
of a porter!

573
01:20:45,305 --> 01:20:50,675
I have these many faces... a brother
to a woman, a father to an orphan...

574
01:20:50,811 --> 01:20:53,939
a servant of Allah,
and a ruler of men.

575
01:20:55,582 --> 01:20:58,142
May The Lord preserve you.

576
01:21:05,492 --> 01:21:10,293
Water my horse.

577
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:05,380
He's coming.
Be ready.

578
01:22:05,519 --> 01:22:06,508
I'm ready.

579
01:22:32,345 --> 01:22:35,439
Where is Abu Hassan?
Tell me!

580
01:22:35,615 --> 01:22:37,344
I myself am looking for him.

581
01:22:37,551 --> 01:22:39,416
Did you go to the well
looking for him?

582
01:22:39,553 --> 01:22:41,487
It was a ploy.
To lure him.

583
01:22:41,655 --> 01:22:45,091
Tell that to the Qazi.

584
01:22:45,358 --> 01:22:47,417
Just wait for a while.
You'll come to know.

585
01:22:48,695 --> 01:22:50,322
Sure.

586
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:53,124
Help me!

587
01:23:41,248 --> 01:23:43,580
We should get out of here.

588
01:23:43,717 --> 01:23:46,447
If the bandits find us,
they will kill us.

589
01:23:46,586 --> 01:23:49,521
If Alibaba finds you,
he will take you to the Qazi.

590
01:23:50,857 --> 01:23:54,315
If Alibaba isn't convinced,
he'll keep coming in our way.

591
01:23:54,494 --> 01:23:57,395
Don't worry about Alibaba.
I'll talk him out of it.

592
01:24:48,715 --> 01:24:49,909
Qasim...

593
01:24:49,983 --> 01:24:51,075
What is it?

594
01:24:51,217 --> 01:24:52,650
That girl gave me the slip.

595
01:24:52,852 --> 01:24:54,649
Which girl?

596
01:24:54,821 --> 01:24:56,254
Morgiana?
- Not Morgiana.

597
01:24:56,389 --> 01:24:59,153
The girl who bought the bladders
from you... Abu Hassan's accomplice.

598
01:24:59,259 --> 01:25:02,854
Gave you the slip?
- Yes. I had got her.

599
01:25:02,963 --> 01:25:05,329
But her men engaged me.
And she escaped.

600
01:25:05,498 --> 01:25:10,128
Forget her.
You'd rather find Morgiana.

601
01:25:16,376 --> 01:25:19,311
Go on. Raise the bids.

602
01:25:19,479 --> 01:25:22,846
Is there no one in Blossoming Gardens
who can afford a gem like this one?

603
01:25:22,983 --> 01:25:24,780
290 Dinars

604
01:25:25,018 --> 01:25:26,645
310 Dinars

605
01:25:26,786 --> 01:25:27,844
370 Dinars

606
01:25:28,088 --> 01:25:34,027
Mustafa, give me one more chance
to find Alibaba. Please!

607
01:25:34,194 --> 01:25:37,322
I'll pay you whatever you want.
One last chance! Please!

608
01:25:37,597 --> 01:25:39,292
525 Dinars

609
01:25:39,466 --> 01:25:41,366
580 Dinars

610
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,434
600 Dinars

611
01:25:48,575 --> 01:25:49,872
650

612
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:52,069
700

613
01:25:55,181 --> 01:26:21,065
Rescue me! My dearest, today your love
is being sold on the streets.

614
01:26:22,108 --> 01:26:30,516
Rejection and Acceptance are both being sold

615
01:26:30,984 --> 01:26:40,086
Rescue me! My dearest, today your love
is being sold on the streets.

616
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:48,759
Rejection and Acceptance are both being sold

617
01:27:08,855 --> 01:27:17,422
Tradition and faithfulness are being
destroyed.

618
01:27:17,831 --> 01:27:29,436
A young woman is stripped down
and being auctioned on the road

619
01:27:30,477 --> 01:27:39,351
I'm being sold off
while they all gaze at me!

620
01:27:39,519 --> 01:27:48,689
Rescue me! My dearest, today your love
is being sold on the streets.

621
01:27:48,828 --> 01:27:56,633
Rejection and Acceptance are both being sold

622
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:31,662
The world is putting a price to my faith
This young woman is shedding tears

623
01:28:36,409 --> 01:28:44,441
The garland of love is being sold.

624
01:28:45,018 --> 01:28:53,551
Rescue me! My dearest, today your love
is being sold on the streets.

625
01:28:53,893 --> 01:29:01,823
Rejection and Acceptance are both being sold

626
01:29:02,669 --> 01:29:30,658
Rescue me! My dearest, today your love
is being sold on the streets.

627
01:29:38,895 --> 01:29:43,127
If you touch my slave,
I'll break your arm!

628
01:29:43,433 --> 01:29:46,869
If you call Morgiana a slave,
I'll pull your tongue out!

629
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:49,500
This isn't your caravan.
You aren't calling the shots here.

630
01:29:49,672 --> 01:29:51,367
I caught her when
I went across the border.

631
01:29:51,508 --> 01:29:54,477
According to our laws,
she's a slave.

632
01:29:54,644 --> 01:29:59,308
I can do whatever I wish.
She's mine. By the law.

633
01:29:59,449 --> 01:30:02,441
I'll teach you what the law is!

634
01:30:02,585 --> 01:30:07,613
If he caught her, she's his slave.
That's the law.

635
01:30:09,025 --> 01:30:10,856
How much?

636
01:30:11,394 --> 01:30:13,362
900 Dinars

637
01:30:13,463 --> 01:30:15,761
I'll give you a thousand.

638
01:30:20,403 --> 01:30:25,431
Amma, I've found Morgiana.

639
01:30:25,542 --> 01:30:27,510
Where is she?

640
01:30:27,644 --> 01:30:29,908
She was being sold
in the slave market.

641
01:30:30,046 --> 01:30:34,949
I need 1000 Dinars for her.
- Qasim will give you the money.

642
01:30:35,118 --> 01:30:39,851
1000 Dinars is a lot of money.

643
01:30:40,023 --> 01:30:41,513
This is a matter of my prestige.

644
01:30:41,658 --> 01:30:42,556
Prestige?

645
01:30:44,394 --> 01:30:46,259
Whose prestige?

646
01:30:46,396 --> 01:30:50,093
A man who has wealth to his name,
is a man of prestige.

647
01:30:50,233 --> 01:30:52,633
What are you saying Qasim?

648
01:30:52,836 --> 01:30:55,737
Whatever there is in this house,
belongs to both of you.

649
01:30:58,541 --> 01:31:00,566
Very well.

650
01:31:01,144 --> 01:31:03,908
Let me see how much
I can lay my hands on.

651
01:31:08,718 --> 01:31:11,516
Qasim never said anything
like that before.

652
01:31:11,721 --> 01:31:14,952
Don't you worry.
Qasim will give you the money.

653
01:31:18,795 --> 01:31:22,424
Here are your 1000 Dinars.

654
01:31:22,899 --> 01:31:25,094
But I'll give it to you
on one condition.

655
01:31:27,437 --> 01:31:29,496
All right. I accept.

656
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:31,436
Think it over well before
you say yes.

657
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:35,705
I've thought it over.
- Sign this paper, then.

658
01:31:36,446 --> 01:31:43,875
It says that you've sold your share
in our property for 1000 Dinars.

659
01:31:44,053 --> 01:31:47,682
You father has just been buried.
And you're robbing...

660
01:31:47,824 --> 01:31:51,316
your brother already?
- Not my fault, Amma.

661
01:31:51,494 --> 01:31:53,553
It's a matter of give and take.

662
01:31:54,163 --> 01:31:56,893
I have decided.

663
01:31:57,133 --> 01:31:59,931
There's another condition.
- Accepted.

664
01:32:00,203 --> 01:32:04,367
Morgiana doesn't enter
this house.

665
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:08,375
You robbed your brother blind.
Now you want to throw him...

666
01:32:08,478 --> 01:32:10,776
out of the house?
Aren't you ashamed?

667
01:32:17,053 --> 01:32:21,683
This house isn't mine anymore.
I won't bring Morgiana here.

668
01:32:21,991 --> 01:32:28,487
And I'll return your 1000 Dinars.
Consider all this my parting gift.

669
01:32:28,965 --> 01:32:30,865
Goodbye.

670
01:32:31,234 --> 01:32:34,965
Don't leave me, son!
- I'll take you with me, Amma.

671
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:41,840
Ali, wait.

672
01:32:42,278 --> 01:32:44,439
I'm coming with you.

673
01:32:45,548 --> 01:32:46,913
Amma!

674
01:32:47,784 --> 01:32:53,689
Your mother is dead!

675
01:33:05,902 --> 01:33:08,336
Not the right thing to do, Qasim.

676
01:33:09,472 --> 01:33:11,770
After all, Alibaba is your brother.

677
01:33:12,241 --> 01:33:14,175
Not your enemy.

678
01:33:18,081 --> 01:33:23,542
I want that wealth. And you're the one
who can give it to me. Not my brother.

679
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,421
Come home with me.
You can hide in my house.

680
01:33:28,825 --> 01:33:33,694
God bless you. I have found
the daughter I never had.

681
01:33:34,731 --> 01:33:37,859
And I have found a mother.

682
01:33:38,034 --> 01:33:41,299
But I thought she was going
to be your bride.

683
01:33:41,537 --> 01:33:43,505
Marry in haste, or you will
regret in leisure.

684
01:33:43,606 --> 01:33:45,836
All in good time.

685
01:33:46,542 --> 01:33:51,036
Before the dam has been built, I may
enjoy none of the pleasures of life.

686
01:33:51,247 --> 01:33:55,650
By the time you have saved up
enough to build the dam...

687
01:33:55,818 --> 01:33:57,809
you will have become
a doddering old man.

688
01:33:59,022 --> 01:34:01,183
You'll become that old man.

689
01:34:01,424 --> 01:34:02,789
I can achieve anything.

690
01:34:02,925 --> 01:34:05,416
I am strong.

691
01:34:06,162 --> 01:34:08,892
And no matter if I have to
cut timber for a living.

692
01:34:22,245 --> 01:34:24,338
Where are you going?

693
01:34:24,514 --> 01:34:26,505
Stop!

694
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:29,477
You won't find a husband waiting
for you over there!

695
01:34:30,486 --> 01:34:31,714
Stop!

696
01:34:44,333 --> 01:34:47,734
You fool! Stop!

697
01:34:54,844 --> 01:34:59,781
Stop, darling. Stop!

698
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,341
Open

699
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:36,341
Sesame

700
01:37:00,036 --> 01:37:01,731
Open Sesame

701
01:39:09,332 --> 01:39:10,856
Take.

702
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,331
You may take.

703
01:39:12,435 --> 01:39:14,198
Do not fear.

704
01:39:15,404 --> 01:39:18,635
I am Sim Sim,
the keeper of the cave.

705
01:39:18,808 --> 01:39:20,173
Where are you?

706
01:39:20,409 --> 01:39:25,278
You cannot see me. Only my Lord
can see me. No one else.

707
01:39:29,318 --> 01:39:33,015
Is all this wealth Abu Hassan's?

708
01:39:33,155 --> 01:39:38,183
Wealth belongs to no one.
Take what you want.

709
01:39:38,361 --> 01:39:42,297
I don't want these riches.
I want Abu Hassan dead.

710
01:39:56,979 --> 01:39:58,241
So much money?!

711
01:39:58,381 --> 01:40:00,713
I stole it.

712
01:40:01,017 --> 01:40:02,951
Have you been robbing people?

713
01:40:05,588 --> 01:40:08,148
I have to build the dam.

714
01:40:08,257 --> 01:40:10,088
With money you've stolen?

715
01:40:11,027 --> 01:40:14,224
This belongs to Abu Hassan.

716
01:40:15,031 --> 01:40:16,498
Have you found him?

717
01:40:16,766 --> 01:40:18,063
Yes.

718
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:22,694
I've just found his whereabouts.
But soon, I'll kill him.

719
01:40:23,072 --> 01:40:24,937
Tomorrow morning, I'll meet the Qazi
and I'll tell him all about it.

720
01:40:25,107 --> 01:40:26,768
Then the dam will never be built.

721
01:40:26,909 --> 01:40:28,137
Why?

722
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:31,871
Once Abu Hassan is apprehended,
his wealth will be confiscated...

723
01:40:32,014 --> 01:40:36,417
by the Badshah of Bahrestan.
And the Badshah sells water.

724
01:40:36,585 --> 01:40:39,452
Do you expect him to give you money
to build a dam?

725
01:40:39,622 --> 01:40:42,921
So I drop the idea
of building the dam?

726
01:40:43,159 --> 01:40:46,424
No. Till the time the dam is built,
let Abu Hassan remain a secret.

727
01:40:49,865 --> 01:40:54,302
Once the dam is built,
it's over for Abu Hassan.

728
01:40:56,972 --> 01:40:59,634
Splendid!

729
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:02,708
What brains!

730
01:41:02,878 --> 01:41:05,244
And why not? You're a princess.

731
01:41:05,548 --> 01:41:07,277
But there's something
that must be done tonight.

732
01:41:07,416 --> 01:41:08,815
What?

733
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:16,323
Who are you?

734
01:41:17,426 --> 01:41:19,656
Morgiana.

735
01:41:19,829 --> 01:41:24,198
So you are Morgiana?
Well, what do you want?

736
01:41:24,467 --> 01:41:27,732
1000 Dinars. Alibaba sends you.

737
01:41:28,104 --> 01:41:29,935
1000 Dinars?

738
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,940
Where did he find the money?

739
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:37,504
Did he rob someone?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

740
01:41:37,613 --> 01:41:40,776
Excuse me, I have to leave.
- Let me escort you home.

741
01:41:40,916 --> 01:41:43,578
No, thank you. Not necessary.
I'm going to the bazaar.

742
01:41:43,786 --> 01:41:46,778
To the bazaar? So late in the night?
What do you to buy from the bazaar?

743
01:41:46,922 --> 01:41:51,916
Alibaba asked me to buy
weighing scales.

744
01:41:52,128 --> 01:41:55,359
A weighing scale? I have one
at home. You can use it.

745
01:42:24,193 --> 01:42:27,560
What if someone wants to know
where all this wealth came from?

746
01:42:28,197 --> 01:42:31,564
I'll say, it was donated by people.

747
01:42:48,050 --> 01:42:50,109
What is the matter?

748
01:42:50,252 --> 01:42:52,584
I'm going to meet Alibaba.

749
01:42:53,122 --> 01:42:54,316
Why?

750
01:42:54,523 --> 01:42:56,423
He called me.

751
01:42:56,759 --> 01:42:57,851
Called you?

752
01:42:57,993 --> 01:43:00,359
Yes. He sent me an invitation.

753
01:43:02,364 --> 01:43:10,169
He has called me over to take my share
of the inheritance.

754
01:44:07,329 --> 01:44:09,490
Congratulations, Alibaba.

755
01:44:09,898 --> 01:44:14,631
You are making Baba's dreams
come true. I am proud of you.

756
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:15,737
What brings you here?

757
01:44:15,971 --> 01:44:20,408
I wish to help you
do your good deed.

758
01:44:20,609 --> 01:44:24,807
Is that true?
- I swear by The Lord!

759
01:44:28,017 --> 01:44:30,485
I am very happy.

760
01:44:30,586 --> 01:44:34,750
If you are here to work with me,
we'll build this dam in no time.

761
01:44:42,698 --> 01:44:45,428
Brother, take this paper
and tear it to pieces.

762
01:44:45,801 --> 01:44:48,964
What is it?
- That scrap of paper.

763
01:44:49,071 --> 01:44:51,835
Tear it to pieces, I tell you.

764
01:44:51,974 --> 01:44:54,238
Tear it! Tear it to pieces,
I tell you.

765
01:44:54,376 --> 01:44:55,968
Give it to me.

766
01:44:56,211 --> 01:44:58,941
Like this... and this!

767
01:45:02,951 --> 01:45:06,910
Do you know why Abu Hassan
blew up the dam?

768
01:45:07,389 --> 01:45:10,881
It was a show of strength. Showcased
to scare the people of Bahrestan.

769
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:14,223
And you're building the dam.
Do you think he'll let you live?

770
01:45:14,396 --> 01:45:17,763
This dam is my mission in life.
There are many more like me, who...

771
01:45:17,933 --> 01:45:21,801
will stake their lives for the dam.
- But the work will grind to a halt...

772
01:45:21,904 --> 01:45:25,499
unless there is money.
- Money there is.

773
01:45:25,774 --> 01:45:30,108
You speak as if you've
found a treasure.

774
01:45:30,312 --> 01:45:34,214
Yes. I have found a treasure.

775
01:45:34,316 --> 01:45:38,446
But I'm not speaking about it,
till the dam is complete.

776
01:45:38,687 --> 01:45:41,986
What if something happens to you?
How will the dam be completed?

777
01:45:42,124 --> 01:45:43,989
Tell me about it, my brother.

778
01:45:48,063 --> 01:45:51,829
You must promise that you won't
go there as long as I am alive.

779
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,697
I swear it. By you.
Now come on.

780
01:46:17,326 --> 01:46:18,190
Open

781
01:46:19,027 --> 01:46:20,756
Sesame

782
01:46:24,433 --> 01:46:26,993
Ya Allah!
(Oh God)

783
01:48:26,255 --> 01:48:26,922
Riches!

784
01:48:26,922 --> 01:48:28,048
Take it.

785
01:48:28,624 --> 01:48:30,285
Take it all. Do not be afraid.

786
01:48:30,459 --> 01:48:33,792
Take as much as you can.
The wealth is all yours.

787
01:48:35,864 --> 01:48:38,594
I will! I will!

788
01:48:39,635 --> 01:48:42,661
This one! And that too!

789
01:48:43,305 --> 01:48:45,170
I'll take it all away!

790
01:48:45,374 --> 01:48:48,639
I'll buy all of Blossoming Gardens!

791
01:48:48,810 --> 01:48:52,109
I'll become the Badshah!

792
01:48:52,247 --> 01:48:55,239
I'll marry many maidens!

793
01:48:56,485 --> 01:49:00,182
Fatima? I'll throw her out!

794
01:49:13,235 --> 01:49:15,169
Door, open up.

795
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:30,851
Open the door.

796
01:49:39,595 --> 01:49:40,892
Open up!

797
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:50,267
I've forgotten it! Tell me!
How do I open the door?

798
01:49:55,577 --> 01:50:00,537
Please! Let me leave!
I will never come here again!

799
01:50:02,084 --> 01:50:06,282
Let me out of here! Please!

800
01:50:37,552 --> 01:50:41,113
There must be someone in here.

801
01:50:41,289 --> 01:50:45,953
I know you're inside the cave!
Come out. You can't escape alive!

802
01:50:47,362 --> 01:50:48,693
You won't?

803
01:50:48,864 --> 01:50:52,197
Look for him. Search every corner.

804
01:51:14,389 --> 01:51:15,947
There's no one here.

805
01:51:16,058 --> 01:51:19,050
No one? We'll find out.

806
01:51:43,952 --> 01:51:46,147
Show me.

807
01:52:22,724 --> 01:52:24,555
Qasim's horse?

808
01:52:25,093 --> 01:52:28,551
Wash your hands and face.
Food is ready.

809
01:52:28,897 --> 01:52:32,765
My love, if you treat me so gently
like the women of Hindustan...

810
01:52:32,968 --> 01:52:37,598
you will spoil me.
- Slaves are meant to serve.

811
01:52:37,806 --> 01:52:40,366
After all, you bought me.
With 1000 Dinars.

812
01:52:40,542 --> 01:52:44,034
1000 Dinars. That was a ransom.

813
01:52:44,246 --> 01:52:48,342
And look at me.
I sold out for nothing.

814
01:52:49,618 --> 01:52:52,519
For nothing?
- That's true.

815
01:52:52,988 --> 01:52:54,353
You liar! What more do you want?

816
01:52:54,456 --> 01:52:56,321
What more do I want!

817
01:53:01,897 --> 01:53:05,663
Where's Qasim? He went
to meet you this morning.

818
01:53:06,168 --> 01:53:09,103
His horse just came back... empty.

819
01:53:09,271 --> 01:53:11,671
Amma...

820
01:53:12,207 --> 01:53:13,834
She's an accomplice of the bandits.

821
01:53:14,075 --> 01:53:17,010
Until I come back, take care of her.
She might be up to something.

822
01:53:17,212 --> 01:53:19,976
Alibaba, listen to me.
- Sure I will.

823
01:53:20,215 --> 01:53:22,080
After I've found my brother.

824
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:24,614
Don't go alone.
It's dangerous.

825
01:53:32,727 --> 01:53:38,165
Qasim, had you not been so greedy...

826
01:54:09,898 --> 01:54:15,564
Qasim! My son!

827
01:54:17,205 --> 01:54:21,574
Who killed him?

828
01:54:24,913 --> 01:54:27,279
The wounds have to be stitched up
before we bury him.

829
01:54:27,449 --> 01:54:31,112
Else, people will become suspicious
and the bandits will find us.

830
01:54:31,419 --> 01:54:35,378
I'll find an undertaker.

831
01:54:35,957 --> 01:54:39,620
Blindfold him.
No one must know.

832
01:54:40,095 --> 01:54:43,223
Alibaba! Listen to me, Alibaba!

833
01:54:43,431 --> 01:54:46,798
Just shut up.
Or I'll bury you with him.

834
01:54:46,968 --> 01:54:48,765
But...

835
01:54:49,638 --> 01:54:51,128
Go on.

836
01:55:04,552 --> 01:55:08,613
The dead man is gone!

837
01:55:10,058 --> 01:55:17,624
And we don't even know who
he is, or where he lives!

838
01:55:17,799 --> 01:55:20,768
So we don't know what
he'll do next!

839
01:55:22,304 --> 01:55:24,670
This is hilarious!

840
01:55:24,839 --> 01:55:28,172
We are forty of us! Forty!

841
01:55:29,945 --> 01:55:32,880
And we are at the mercy
of one man!

842
01:55:34,416 --> 01:55:35,883
Swines!

843
01:55:36,284 --> 01:55:41,221
Who are the ones who play
with lives? We do!

844
01:55:41,623 --> 01:55:45,491
Who turns blood into gold?
We do!

845
01:55:47,329 --> 01:55:52,733
If they have found our wealth,
they will find us!

846
01:55:52,901 --> 01:55:56,132
Who will find him?
Who, amongst you?

847
01:55:56,237 --> 01:56:01,504
Abu Hassan, leave it to me.

848
01:56:02,744 --> 01:56:05,941
Find out where Fatima is.

849
01:56:06,214 --> 01:56:09,809
I'm sure she's behind this.

850
01:56:10,952 --> 01:56:15,116
Find her... wherever she may be.

851
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:20,657
Eat something.

852
01:56:25,133 --> 01:56:27,033
Come, I'll untie you.

853
01:56:30,405 --> 01:56:35,035
Will you be able to escape the
hangman's noose as easily?

854
01:56:35,276 --> 01:56:41,112
Who is scared of death?
I'm just waiting for him.

855
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:44,683
In which case, you'll have
to wait this night out.

856
01:56:44,953 --> 01:56:48,252
Tomorrow morning, Alibaba is going
to turn you over to the Qazi.

857
01:56:48,490 --> 01:56:52,449
I don't want Alibaba
to be responsible...

858
01:56:52,627 --> 01:56:56,427
for the death of an innocent.
- The decision about your innocence...

859
01:56:56,564 --> 01:57:02,127
will be taken tomorrow.
You have my sympathies.

860
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:05,664
But Alibaba has just buried
his brother.

861
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:09,103
I don't think he's in any mood
to listen.

862
01:57:13,748 --> 01:57:16,182
Believe me! I'm innocent.

863
01:57:18,887 --> 01:57:21,151
Fatima is escaping!
Come with me.

864
01:58:01,629 --> 01:58:03,256
Go this way.
I'll look the other way.

865
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:11,295
Come into my arms, love.

866
01:58:37,732 --> 01:58:39,791
New here?

867
01:58:40,034 --> 01:58:44,130
How about a drink, my love?

868
01:58:47,709 --> 01:58:50,303
Get off me!

869
01:58:56,818 --> 01:58:58,877
You'd rather come with me.

870
01:58:59,087 --> 01:59:02,386
Leave me!

871
01:59:30,552 --> 01:59:34,682
Allah helps those
who help others.

872
01:59:35,523 --> 01:59:38,856
Morgiana is in danger.
I must help her out.

873
01:59:39,127 --> 01:59:41,425
I'll leave the rest to Allah.

874
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:57,369
In the whole city there is only one beauty
and she can only be me, not anyone else!

875
02:00:08,823 --> 02:00:20,894
In the whole city there is only one beauty
and she can only be me, not anyone else!

876
02:00:21,836 --> 02:00:29,572
Don't look at that her, look at me!

877
02:00:29,911 --> 02:00:42,085
In the whole city there is only one beauty
and she can only be me, not anyone else!

878
02:00:42,590 --> 02:00:50,827
Don't look at that her, look at me

879
02:01:17,659 --> 02:01:33,906
If you dare to love me,
you'll never forget it.

880
02:01:34,309 --> 02:01:39,440
Then you'll never take another name again

881
02:01:43,851 --> 02:01:47,252
You bitch! You think you can
escape us?

882
02:01:48,089 --> 02:01:50,216
Come along.

883
02:02:03,071 --> 02:02:15,279
In the whole city there is only one beauty
and she can only be me, not anyone else!

884
02:02:15,850 --> 02:02:23,848
Don't look at that her, look at me

885
02:02:48,950 --> 02:03:04,730
All eyes are on me, while yours are astray

886
02:03:05,066 --> 02:03:10,197
You ain't gonna find a babe like me anywhere

887
02:03:11,639 --> 02:03:19,546
In the whole city there is only one beauty
and she can only be me, not anyone else!

888
02:03:19,881 --> 02:03:28,050
Don't look at that her, look at me

889
02:03:50,545 --> 02:03:58,179
You best stay away from my man!
Your man wants me, not you!

890
02:03:58,352 --> 02:04:06,316
You best stay away from my man!
Your man wants me, not you!

891
02:04:06,627 --> 02:04:11,587
What are you compared to me?
You are a hoochie!

892
02:04:12,700 --> 02:04:20,732
In the whole city there is only one beauty
and she can only be me, not anyone else!

893
02:04:21,542 --> 02:04:28,846
Don't look at that her, look at me

894
02:06:26,911 --> 02:06:28,879
And then my father
committed suicide.

895
02:06:31,348 --> 02:06:36,615
Your brother gave me shelter.
But now that's gone too.

896
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:41,758
Now there is only one thing
that I live for.

897
02:06:42,393 --> 02:06:45,794
The fire of revenge
rages in my heart.

898
02:06:47,598 --> 02:06:51,898
One day, I'll find him.

899
02:06:52,103 --> 02:06:54,162
By which time, Abu Hassan
will have found us.

900
02:06:54,538 --> 02:06:55,698
What do you mean?

901
02:06:55,906 --> 02:06:58,670
We are marked. Someone has put
a mark on our door.

902
02:06:58,943 --> 02:07:02,811
No one else but Abu Hassan
needs to track us.

903
02:07:03,147 --> 02:07:07,550
He might attack.
Any moment now.

904
02:07:08,619 --> 02:07:11,782
We should inform the Qazi.

905
02:07:11,989 --> 02:07:15,891
I'll inform the Qazi about
everything tomorrow morning.

906
02:07:30,608 --> 02:07:31,836
Which house?

907
02:07:31,976 --> 02:07:33,637
The one with the mark.

908
02:07:35,813 --> 02:07:37,838
There's a mark here too.

909
02:07:42,419 --> 02:07:44,751
One over there too.

910
02:07:50,995 --> 02:07:52,860
Did you mark all of them?

911
02:07:53,030 --> 02:07:55,191
No. I just marked one.

912
02:07:55,366 --> 02:07:58,062
The enemy has outsmarted us.

913
02:07:58,202 --> 02:08:01,501
Someone must've seen you while
you were marking this house.

914
02:08:03,874 --> 02:08:05,432
Qazi sahib, you?

915
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:10,270
I was just coming to you.

916
02:08:10,447 --> 02:08:12,574
I have found Abu Hassan's cave.

917
02:08:12,716 --> 02:08:18,484
The more men we can muster,
the better.

918
02:08:18,622 --> 02:08:21,648
That devil won't surrender
to us so easily.

919
02:08:21,926 --> 02:08:24,360
Not so fast, Alibaba.

920
02:08:25,095 --> 02:08:27,723
Abu Hassan's spies might be here
in Blossoming Gardens.

921
02:08:27,898 --> 02:08:32,767
If they get wind that we are coming,
the bandits will vanish.

922
02:08:32,937 --> 02:08:35,667
What should we do then?

923
02:08:36,006 --> 02:08:43,174
Prepare for battle.
Muster 300 men at arms.

924
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:45,345
I am not destined to be defeated.

925
02:08:45,516 --> 02:08:47,143
The man whom no one could find...

926
02:08:47,251 --> 02:08:49,651
comes walking to me.

927
02:08:49,753 --> 02:08:51,243
Shall we proceed, Alibaba?

928
02:08:51,388 --> 02:08:52,912
Come.

929
02:09:34,565 --> 02:09:37,728
For the last time, Alibaba,
give me two answers.

930
02:09:40,437 --> 02:09:45,272
Where is Fatima hiding?
- I don't know any Fatima.

931
02:09:45,442 --> 02:09:50,345
Who else knows about the cave?
- I am the only one who knows.

932
02:09:50,614 --> 02:09:57,349
Think it over again, Alibaba.
You might remember?

933
02:09:57,621 --> 02:10:05,824
My brother knew about it.
And you've already killed him.

934
02:10:07,331 --> 02:10:10,266
If your brother knew,
your wife must be knowing too.

935
02:10:10,534 --> 02:10:13,833
You haven't a wife?
Well, you'll die a bachelor.

936
02:10:14,038 --> 02:10:19,806
He won't answer my questions. Maybe
he doesn't know I mean business.

937
02:10:31,355 --> 02:10:34,119
What is the mark
I put on your head?

938
02:10:34,325 --> 02:10:39,285
The mark I put
on Alibaba's house.

939
02:10:39,463 --> 02:10:41,795
And why is the mark
on your head now?

940
02:10:42,967 --> 02:10:46,994
Because that is the punishment
for a mistake.

941
02:10:47,137 --> 02:10:49,037
And you deserve it!

942
02:10:52,443 --> 02:10:54,308
Did you hear that?

943
02:10:54,478 --> 02:11:01,646
You and your family will pay
for your crimes.

944
02:11:02,419 --> 02:11:05,855
You killed my father!

945
02:11:06,256 --> 02:11:09,248
You murdered my brother!

946
02:11:09,426 --> 02:11:12,418
Not a word more about my family.

947
02:11:12,629 --> 02:11:15,393
I am the only one who knows
about this.

948
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:18,432
Do what you want to do with me!

949
02:11:24,675 --> 02:11:27,508
What say you, Alibaba?
Should I let him go?

950
02:11:29,179 --> 02:11:31,238
He will pray for you.

951
02:11:33,851 --> 02:11:35,648
Let him go.

952
02:11:36,286 --> 02:11:38,345
Run away.

953
02:11:39,089 --> 02:11:40,750
Run!

954
02:12:02,579 --> 02:12:06,481
You murderous dog!

955
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:10,545
Where is Qazi sahib?
Tell me, where is the Qazi?

956
02:12:13,524 --> 02:12:16,288
You've killed him too!

957
02:12:18,729 --> 02:12:21,357
Pull.

958
02:13:00,771 --> 02:13:03,296
He mustn't escape!

959
02:14:48,045 --> 02:14:50,240
Flood the dam!

960
02:14:51,615 --> 02:14:57,178
Open the lock.
Let the water in.

961
02:14:57,387 --> 02:15:00,356
Let the water in.

962
02:15:08,232 --> 02:15:12,168
Alibaba! Hurry!

963
02:15:30,454 --> 02:15:34,788
Friends, the Qazi is in danger.
We went in search of Abu Hassan.

964
02:15:34,958 --> 02:15:37,153
And there's still no news of him.
I'm afraid he must be...

965
02:15:37,327 --> 02:15:39,056
Qazi sahib is here...

966
02:15:39,296 --> 02:15:42,390
Friends, prepare to celebrate.

967
02:15:42,599 --> 02:15:46,000
Now you have nothing to fear
from Abu Hassan.

968
02:15:46,236 --> 02:15:51,139
With this sword he has been killed.
I have killed him myself.

969
02:15:51,308 --> 02:15:54,334
To Qazi sahib...
- Glory be!

970
02:15:55,445 --> 02:15:58,573
And thanks to Alibaba, water flows
in the canal once again.

971
02:15:58,749 --> 02:16:01,240
Let us celebrate for 40 days.

972
02:16:01,485 --> 02:16:04,113
In these 40 pitchers, is kept
the wealth Abu Hassan looted.

973
02:16:04,254 --> 02:16:06,916
Every day, the riches in one pitcher
will be given away to the poor.

974
02:16:07,090 --> 02:16:10,924
These pitchers are to be kept
in Alibaba's house.

975
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:16,199
"Abu Hassan took it from me"

976
02:16:16,433 --> 02:16:18,799
"Abu Hassan took it from me"

977
02:16:21,972 --> 02:16:24,167
"Abu Hassan took it from me"

978
02:16:30,681 --> 02:16:34,674
For this moment I have waited
an eternity, Qazi sahib!

979
02:17:02,746 --> 02:17:05,943
Fatima, where are you going?

980
02:17:06,149 --> 02:17:07,480
I'm going away.

981
02:17:07,651 --> 02:17:09,312
Why?

982
02:17:10,787 --> 02:17:13,051
I have lost.

983
02:17:17,394 --> 02:17:19,954
I couldn't avenge my father's death.

984
02:17:20,063 --> 02:17:22,031
Who says?

985
02:17:22,165 --> 02:17:24,633
We're celebrating your victory.

986
02:17:28,138 --> 02:17:31,505
Inside the 40 pitchers
are the forty bandits.

987
02:18:18,989 --> 02:18:28,296
If the secret in my heart ever comes out,
all hell will break loose.

988
02:18:28,532 --> 02:18:39,170
Doom! Doom! Doom!

989
02:18:39,342 --> 02:18:58,627
If the secret in my heart ever comes out,
Dooms Day will surely arrive!!

990
02:19:19,449 --> 02:19:38,358
Happy returns to you all.
Try to understand what I'm saying

991
02:19:38,768 --> 02:19:58,280
When my innocent glances are fixed on you
you day for Reckoning will surely come!!!

992
02:20:44,067 --> 02:21:03,045
When the flower's bud blooms
Sparks fly from the fire.

993
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:23,499
When Springs flowers arrive
you will face the Day of Judgement.

994
02:21:49,599 --> 02:22:08,543
Why do people hide their faces
Using a disguise to fool us

995
02:22:08,885 --> 02:22:17,850
When this beauty removes her veil
The End of Days will arrive

996
02:22:18,081 --> 02:22:19,013
Abu Hassan!

997
02:22:19,349 --> 02:22:20,373
The bandit!

998
02:22:20,984 --> 02:22:22,713
The Qazi is the bandit!

999
02:22:22,886 --> 02:22:25,855
Mark him well,
men of Blossoming Gardens.

1000
02:22:26,323 --> 02:22:29,087
He is the Qazi.

1001
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:33,691
The keeper of the law
is a murderous bandit!

1002
02:22:33,897 --> 02:22:36,866
Our Qazi, alias Abu Hassan.

1003
02:22:39,503 --> 02:22:43,496
Abu Hassan, your game is over.

1004
02:22:44,674 --> 02:22:50,806
You fool, who do you think
has the guts to face Abu Hassan?

1005
02:22:51,214 --> 02:22:58,552
Come out men!
Let's paint the town red!

1006
02:22:58,755 --> 02:23:02,316
Let's burn it down!
Don't spare a man!

1007
02:23:04,327 --> 02:23:05,817
No one?

1008
02:23:05,929 --> 02:23:09,990
Where the hell is everyone?

1009
02:23:10,133 --> 02:23:12,966
They are dead and gone.

1010
02:23:13,703 --> 02:23:17,230
But I have a gift for you.
A gift from Hell.

1011
02:23:17,441 --> 02:23:19,409
Remember this?

1012
02:23:19,576 --> 02:23:21,168
Gunpowder

1013
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:25,906
You blew up the dam and
you made us pay for water!

1014
02:23:26,917 --> 02:23:31,320
With your blood you will pay
for the water we thirsted for!

1015
02:23:31,455 --> 02:23:33,355
Stop!

1016
02:23:34,491 --> 02:23:36,755
What have you done?

1017
02:23:39,729 --> 02:23:47,067
Get ready to face Allah.

1018
02:23:47,971 --> 02:23:52,931
Say it with me:

1019
02:23:54,311 --> 02:23:58,839
There is no God but Allah

1020
02:23:58,949 --> 02:24:00,712
Say it!

1021
02:24:01,151 --> 02:24:05,451
There is no God but Allah

1022
02:24:06,656 --> 02:24:11,150
And Mohammed is His prophet

1023
02:24:28,512 --> 02:24:32,505
Sim-Sim, shut the gate.
Alibaba is coming for me.

1024
02:24:33,250 --> 02:24:37,277
I am all alone.
All my men have been killed.

1025
02:24:37,454 --> 02:24:42,118
A woman... you have brought
a woman here again.

1026
02:24:42,259 --> 02:24:45,592
I had told you to
beware of women.

1027
02:24:45,896 --> 02:24:49,923
A woman will destroy you.
I have told you that.

1028
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:52,293
Help me, Sim-Sim.

1029
02:24:52,669 --> 02:24:57,470
I will try, my Lord. For as long
as you are alive, I live.

1030
02:25:01,178 --> 02:25:07,413
The gate is closed forever.

1031
02:25:08,351 --> 02:25:10,319
Open Sesame

1032
02:25:12,422 --> 02:25:14,049
Open Sesame!

1033
02:25:23,733 --> 02:25:26,201
Now you're dead.

1034
02:25:49,359 --> 02:25:51,884
Alibaba! We must get out of here!

1035
02:25:53,463 --> 02:25:54,657
Where is Abu Hassan?

1036
02:25:54,831 --> 02:25:57,629
He's dead. Look, he's lying there.

1037
02:25:59,269 --> 02:26:04,400
He escaped my revenge!
I would've avenged...

1038
02:26:04,641 --> 02:26:09,442
my father, my brother, Fatima, and
everyone else in Blossoming Gardens.

1039
02:26:09,613 --> 02:26:12,673
Forget it. Hurry up now.
This place is scary.

1040
02:26:12,816 --> 02:26:13,874
Wait...

1041
02:26:14,017 --> 02:26:15,814
What happened?

1042
02:26:16,419 --> 02:26:18,819
I must take my father's ring.

1043
02:26:47,150 --> 02:26:49,243
I am here, Alibaba.

1044
02:26:49,386 --> 02:26:51,445
And I am here, Alibaba.

1045
02:26:52,656 --> 02:26:56,558
Very brave of you to have
come all alone.

1046
02:26:57,160 --> 02:26:59,253
This is going to be
difficult for you.

1047
02:27:00,430 --> 02:27:04,526
For there isn't just one Abu Hassan.
There are 40 Abu Hassans here.

1048
02:27:04,701 --> 02:27:08,068
Can you ever find out
who the real one is?

1049
02:27:21,851 --> 02:27:24,376
Which one of us?

1050
02:27:24,521 --> 02:27:27,752
A lie can never be hidden.

1051
02:27:29,259 --> 02:27:32,820
You think the disguise
can save you?

1052
02:27:33,330 --> 02:27:36,822
I'll find you, and then
I'll kill you like a dog!

1053
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:41,096
We don't use threats.

1054
02:27:42,706 --> 02:27:48,076
But I promise you a death
like a death never before.

1055
02:27:48,244 --> 02:27:50,906
Where is Morgiana?

1056
02:27:51,281 --> 02:27:54,273
Alibaba! I'm here!

1057
02:28:31,321 --> 02:28:43,529
Morgiana... where are you?

1058
02:28:45,068 --> 02:28:47,696
Alibaba! I'm here!

1059
02:28:48,405 --> 02:28:50,305
Alibaba! Help me!

1060
02:30:10,386 --> 02:30:16,188
Abu Hassan! Father!

1061
02:31:06,442 --> 02:31:08,069
Help!

1062
02:31:28,064 --> 02:31:30,692
Don't move.

1063
02:31:35,338 --> 02:31:38,774
There are many who seek revenge
against Abu Hassan.

1064
02:31:38,942 --> 02:31:42,810
But you are the object of
Abu Hassan's revenge!
