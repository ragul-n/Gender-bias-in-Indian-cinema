1
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,780
Bejawada

2
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,720
It has unswerving devotion for goddess Durga...

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,880
as well as the blood spilling for deadly violence.

4
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,500
To act as an evidence for both,

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,520
there is River Krishna too.

6
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,860
Brother...

7
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,880
Brother, I don't know anything.
Keep Moving...

8
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,580
I really don't know anything brother.
Keep moving

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Where is he?

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,860
I don't know brother.

11
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:01,720
Hey!

12
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,160
I know that you know it

13
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,320
Where is he?

14
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,480
Where is that bloody Lara?

15
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,700
Get your phone out.

16
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,880
Get it out now!

17
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,460
Isn't it your new number?
Yes!

18
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,840
Check this man,

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,660
check this!

20
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,760
Hey,

21
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,760
he is anyway going to die.

22
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,900
Do you want to live or not?

23
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,440
It's true that he called me.

24
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,980
But, I really don't know where he is, brother!

25
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,320
Trust me.

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,200
aaah

27
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,160
(Phone rings)

28
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,140
It's Lara, isn't it?

29
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,360
Talk to him.

30
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,460
But act normal.

31
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,820
Here, talk!

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
Switch on the speaker and tell him you are home.

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,240
uh.. Lara...

34
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,720
Did you go home?

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,140
Not yet, but i'll go now!

36
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,240
ok

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,480
uh... Are you alright?

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,060
Where are you?

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,480
I am in Amaravati.

40
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,900
Ok. ok. Be careful.

41
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,380
Keep him hear until Lara is dead

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,520
No.

43
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,680
What?
No.

44
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,040
No

45
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,240
(grunts)

46
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,520
Round him up guys.

47
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,200
(Squealing in pain)

48
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,620
(indistinct voices following)

49
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,280
aaaaah

50
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,220
(indistinct voices continuous to follow)

51
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,320
We all take birth in the same way

52
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
while breathing in for the first time

53
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,160
We all die in the same way too

54
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
by breathing out for the last time

55
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,840
We only live in different ways

56
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,760
Being humans, we often say

57
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,360
a man should live like this and that

58
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,620
what does it mean?

59
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,180
We have something in us apart from humanity

60
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,840
Rangu - Color

61
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,380
Buddy, give me some colors

62
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,600
come on, quick!

63
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,420
(Panting)

64
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,780
KIds get smarter as they grow

65
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,180
they don't get dumb

66
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
Exams are coming up

67
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,960
Do you even consider studying?

68
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,160
Eating and roaming around

69
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,800
Do you get food for playing?

70
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,180
Do you get ranks for playing colors?

71
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,220
what happened sister? You seem angry on someone.

72
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,440
Who else?

73
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,580
We've got one

74
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,140
He left in the morning and came back now

75
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,980
Exams are approaching and he isn't bothered to study

76
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,580
Though he is playful, Lara is good with studies sister!

77
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,500
He was topper of the school in his 10th, wasn't he?

78
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,075
That doesn't mean

79
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,280
he keeps roaming around now, right!

80
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,620
(indistinct cheers)

81
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,460
Hey Bheem, hit it man!

82
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,100
Come on Bheem!

83
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,460
Catch

84
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:55,960
hey

85
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,060
(Clapping)

86
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,620
Hey Lara, you go now

87
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,740
You fat ass!

88
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,120
You jumped in like a hero

89
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,040
Lara, come on! come on!

90
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,440
It's ok man! Give it here

91
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,180
(Cheering Lara)

92
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,480
Lara is here now

93
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,140
(Clapping)

94
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,000
(Cheering continuous)

95
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,960
Brother.. You got state second rank man!

96
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,800
(Cheering)

97
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,100
They've published you photo in newspaper

98
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,880
(Cheering)

99
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,120
Congrats mate!

100
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,320
Thanks, Thanks, Thank you man!

101
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,460
Congrats

102
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
They are here yar!

103
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,860
Your batch looks good!

104
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,360
Hey, you are the state second ranker, aren't you?

105
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,140
You are excused man! Step aside.

106
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,120
Bro, see what to do with them now!

107
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,320
Bro, I've got a good concept

108
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,260
hmmm.. hey

109
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,220
You come forward

110
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,860
come.. come here

111
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,560
Do you know how to braid the hair?

112
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,180
No, brother!

113
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,196
Take this girl aside,

114
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,440
braid her hair and come back.

115
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,140
Ok, brother!

116
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,920
(Girl starts weeping)

117
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,680
Go go

118
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,460
Hey Srinu, girls are coming man!

119
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,180
Oh girls!

120
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,380
Hey pal, that Yellow dress is mine!

121
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,080
You dawg!

122
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,960
(indistinct comments)

123
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,300
Yey yey

124
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,520
Hi

125
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,220
Bandi Srinu

126
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,160
Hey, you come here man!

127
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,120
Sir!

128
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,860
She is my girlfriend...

129
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,700
Girlfriend?

130
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,140
Your intermediate love isn't valid in graduation, dear!

131
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:33,840
go now

132
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,140
I've done this too

133
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,300
You're getting for class

134
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,400
Hi, Bandi Srinu!

135
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,900
Your Senior

136
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,060
She is my girlfriend.

137
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,560
what?

138
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
You aren't scared of seniors?

139
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,100
Didn't I tell you to get going?

140
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,660
get lost!

141
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,920

142
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,020
what? what happened bro?

143
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,220
What are you staring at man?

144
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,740
Go

145
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,780
hey hey hey, wait man. What happened?

146
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,060
I didn't say anything man..

147
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,600
Paddu..

148
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,300
You are frowning at me?

149
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,380
Am not leaving your girlfriend now

150
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,460
I been telling him that's my girlfriend.

151
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,500
They are doing this on Day 1

152
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,640
They might start ragging us from tomorrow!

153
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,140
Listen to me, Paddu!

154
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,260
Don't come to college. Just for four days.

155
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,160
I will talk to seniors and sort it meanwhile.

156
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,300
If I don't go to college, my dad will ask for reason.

157
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,160
father.. father!

158
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,480
If you think you want me,

159
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,960
don't come to college

160
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,940
Hey you... don't intend to study in this college?

161
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,140
When injuries are in the destiny,

162
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,360
no one can change it

163
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,280
Hi guys

164
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Hi man

165
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,680
Watch this guys

166
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,040
He saw the girl yesterday

167
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,140
today his full sleeves shirt became half sleeves one.

168
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,880
bro, the shirt's looking good

169
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,460
hmm go on

170
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,400
Paddu

171
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,100
is mine

172
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,340
Paddu won't come to college until I say so

173
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,020
what?

174
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,340
she won't come?

175
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,520
look there

176
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,400
Didn't I tell you?

177
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,280
Leave the past in past

178
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,460
She left it

179
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,480
That's why she is here

180
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,800
It's better if you get over it too

181
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,400
huh

182
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,980
Don't ever show me your face again. get lost!

183
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,640
(crying)

184
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,360
I am telling you the same

185
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,080
don't ever show your face to that girl.

186
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,400
aaay

187
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,120
hey, what happened

188
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,860
You...

189
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,720
(indistinct chatter of crowd)

190
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,080
Leave me guys

191
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,340
hey

192
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,540
Not now!

193
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,740
He roams around in certain locality

194
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,260
He walks in certain roads

195
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,660
and we have a certain time to do this

196
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,560
Yes! I live in the same locality through out the day

197
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,400
Come there and show prove your guts.

198
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,040
come here

199
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,980
Wrangle

200
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,160
Let's go strike the sky

201
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,080
nothing is impossible in the way of our aspirations

202
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
Wrangle

203
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,700
Let's rip open the darkness

204
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,240
Let's spread the rays of colors in every corner

205
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,660
The stars that shines bright in a place with no sunrise

206
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,960
they don't turn into the color of darkness

207
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,680
the one's who believes themselves

208
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,540
don't runaway from the shadow of fears

209
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,180
I've been observing from over 6 months

210
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,180
you both seem to find reasons to fight

211
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
this is last and final warning

212
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,140
you fight one more time,

213
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,820
and I'll suspend you both from the college

214
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,480
get out

215
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,480
Wrangle

216
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,820
Let's rip open the darkness

217
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,340
Let's spread the rays of colors in every corner

218
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,140
where the hell is he?

219
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,800
It's been a year that I removed her from my memory

220
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,340
Tell her to never come this side

221
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,080
ok, brother!

222
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,020
hit him man!

223
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,480
You'll hit Banda Srinu's friend?

224
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,300
come, come

225
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,500
hey!

226
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,500
(indistinct fights and grunts)

227
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,440
I guess they went that way!

228
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,120
No yar, I think they went this way!

229
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,860
hey hey, police man! police..

230
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,920
Hey what are you guys doing here at this hour?

231
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,520
Sir, we are coming back from a movie.

232
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,020
No, sir. They are coming back from some fights

233
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,540
trust me sir.

234
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,300
look here

235
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,460
see, the timber they carried with them

236
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,980
ok.. stay on line for a minute.

237
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,260
They came here with these sir!

238
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,520
look at them sir.

239
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,480
Where are you from?

240
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
Chitti Nagar sir!

241
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,920
If I see you like this again, I'll rip you apart.

242
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,320
keep walking.

243
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,140
Suri,

244
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,340
take him to the hospital

245
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,300
are you the ones who fought?

246
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,560
I been seeing them from the last 2 years

247
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,800
This is what they are up to

248
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,060
Why are you fighting instead of studies?

249
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,220
huh!

250
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,840
Wanna taste jail treatment once?

251
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,300
huh?

252
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,760
Sir, please call their parents

253
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,280
Sure, sir!

254
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,420
such a studious kid,

255
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,560
i thought he'll get good ranks

256
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,100
he's bringing fights home, instead!

257
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,040
Did he ever listen to me?

258
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,500
now the matter reached cops

259
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,620
I don't know what's next now!

260
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,740
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

261
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,360
It's all because of you

262
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,980
you spoiled him

263
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,180
did you ever stop him?

264
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,020
We can try and talk to humans

265
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Guys, it's really bad at home!

266
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,660
They might stop my studies too

267
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,360
Paddu is married now too

268
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,020
Let's stop all these fights

269
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,080
Hey, Lara!

270
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,460
Let's not bother them from today.

271
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,940
let's talk to them and tell them the same

272
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,520
what if they take us for granted?

273
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,680
Nothing will happen man!

274
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,160
Guys, Ravi is coming here!

275
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,560
Look guys, whatever happened has happened.

276
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,800
Let's stop fighting and focus on exams

277
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,580
If you agree,

278
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,060
my friends will join too

279
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,120
It's a mistake!

280
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,360
I shouldn't have done like that the other day.

281
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,960
I am sorry!

282
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,520
You are not the only one to blame.

283
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,080
I should've given you respect as seniors.

284
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,520
Anyway, I am sorry!

285
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,160
No formalities among us.

286
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,280
We are all friends.

287
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,780
Alright friends

288
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,280

289
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:23,900

290
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,740
wait wait

291
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,880
For us, today is Fresher's Day!

292
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,000
So...

293
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,000
Let's enjoy the party!

294
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,280
(cheering)

295
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,500
Cheers

296
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,020
Hey!

297
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,780
It's that Auto guy who got us in trouble the other day

298
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,580
him?

299
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,980
Come, guys

300
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,500
Stop, man!

301
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,720
what? you'll tell everything to the cops?

302
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,520
huh!

303
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,300
you fight and yell at each other

304
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,880
why does it matter to you?

305
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,980
Hey, who will save you here?

306
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,640

307
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,760

308
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,260

310
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,760

311
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,060
Hey, you leave now

312
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,600

313
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,240
let's go guys, it's unnecessary ..

314
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,040
Hey.. you think am alone?

315
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,240
I will see you tomorrow!

316
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,940
Who the hell is your group man?

317
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,620

318
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,820

321
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,400
are you blind?

322
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,800
the road is your dad's property?

323
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,640

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000

(panting)

339
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,800
He is dead!

340
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,900

341
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,800

350
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,840
I beg you.. please wait

351
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
Greetings, sir!

352
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,280
Lara's father.

353
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,420
Greetings, sir!

354
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,960
what happened?

355
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,920
Did he kill intentionally?

356
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,700
no no..

357
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,944
that was an accident.

358
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:05,720
he is not that kind of a guy..

359
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,820
Is he around? or ran away?

360
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,495
He didn't run away.

361
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,880
He'll be here if we send him a message.

362
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,940
We will talk rest of the formalities later!

363
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,240
There is a procedure to everything

364
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,760
Procedure!

365
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,820
We will catch that guy in 24 hours

366
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,140
and will file an FIR

367
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,000
Did you get it?

368
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,620

00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,200
I don't know

372
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,740

373
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,080
I am telling you I don't know anything..
(laughing)

374
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,620
You think I'll let you go?

375
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,940
I don't know anything

376
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,300

377
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,120

378
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,240
Sir, he might die sir!

379
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,280

380
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,080
come here

381
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,840
You think you can scare me with all this?

382
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,880
take him to the clinic..

383
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,140
move

384
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,860
trying to petrify me

385
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,380
who is this?

386
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,880
Lara..

387
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,200
I mean, last night's murder case

388
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
how dare you killing someone?

389
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,480
if you lock you up and start smacking...

390
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,800
everything comes out.

391
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,240
sir.. sir.. I didn't do anything sir!

392
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,740
I don't know anything, sir!

393
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,900
I didn't do it intentionally sir..

394
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,380
me.. me.. I ..

395
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,440
I didn't do it sir

396
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,820
Hey suri..

397
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,320
sir

398
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,760
He is our's... don't be harsh sir!

399
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,580
Get this Lara's casefile.

400
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,260
ok, sir!

401
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,620
Collect the FIR copy and apply for the bail.

402
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,780
Don't get scared

403
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,880
the lawyer will take care of everything

404
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,980
I am with you, my prisoner brothers!

405
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,480
Prisoner brothers!

406
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,780
This crack-head started again..

407
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,860
Coming...

408
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,923
they are coming...

409
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:03,640
the mighty wheels of lord Jagannatha's chariot

410
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,560
Let's go forward..

411
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,660
Let's push each other..

412
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,980
Let's go.. let's go upwards

413
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,180
Brother, what is this torture to us?

414
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,380
Is there no one out there to give you bail?

415
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,080
Everyone is trampling my brother's bail

416
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,900
We still won't stay calm

417
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,700
yeah.. trampling you

418
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
brother, what is you problem?

419
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,260
hand me the blanket

420
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,760
here, brother!

421
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,380
what are these holes?

422
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,580
what?

423
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,860
you idiot..

424
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,680
All this drama for a blanket?

425
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,800
Today, it's blanket

426
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,040
tomorrow it will be dark night

427
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,380
Day after comes the light

428
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,320
later afternoon

429
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,340
follwed by evening

430
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,140
how long do we bear the corruption?

431
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,880
Stop it

432
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,720
I will get you a new blanket in 30 minutes, ok?

433
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,600
I want a pillow too

434
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,140
ok

435
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,040
Who is this little brother?

436
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,840
He committed a murder

437
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,680
oh mother!

438
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,380
get in.

439
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,780
Brother, you didn't get your pubes too

440
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,900
you committed a murder?

441
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,284
If this was in my Vijayawada,

442
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:51,840
I'd have separated your hands and legs, brother!

443
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
He is from your Vijayawada too

444
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,460
what?

445
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,120
Brother, come...

446
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,460
sit here

447
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,600
My dear,

448
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,000
Who did you kill?

449
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,600
I don't know him brother..

450
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,160
We were fighting. It was by mistake..

451
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,800
Ooh.. a street fight?

452
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,680
and it was by accident..

453
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
nothing will happen

454
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,780
I will take care

455
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,420
I will take care, brother!

456
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,940
Brother..

457
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,420
why did you come to jail?

458
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:16,920
Conspiracy

459
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,040
They made a conspiracy on brother.

460
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,220
I will narrate, brother!

461
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,400
Ok, bro!
The conspiracy was on me, wasn't it?

462
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,920
I will narrate in detail..

463
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,200
Brother...

464
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,340
Chitti Nagar corporator is Balaraju..

465
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,880
I have a huge bar in the same Chitti Nagar

466
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,360
The corporator came to me one day and..

467
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,060
asked me to sell my bar

468
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,080
I won't see it, brother.

469
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,640
sell it, brother..

470
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,560
Sorry, brother!

471
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,220
That't it

472
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,060
he's got grudge on me

473
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,540
They've filed a false case saying I sell tainted liquor

474
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,640
They put in jail now

475
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,460
He tookover my bar too

476
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,640
brother...

477
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,800
I won't leave

478
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,760
I will get out

479
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,980
I will win as a corporator against him

480
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,200
I will win against the MLA supporting him.

481
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,060
By the way, did you appoint a lawyer?

482
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,660
yes

483
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,740
Is it? very good!

484
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,520
Who is the lawyer, brother?

485
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,380
Lawyer Ramesh

486
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,100
Oh god!

487
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,500
Mr. Chalasani Ramesh?

488
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,540
A very good friend of mine

489
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,320
brother...

490
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,780
you are winning this case

491
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,900
getting out

492
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,880
you are almost out

493
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,900
that's all. I am there with you

494
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,660
huh! what is this sir?

495
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,580
I saved your guy's life and I get just 2 lakhs?

496
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,600
SI sir, you are not understanding onething...

497
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,440
Lara's father believed his son is to blame for this murder

498
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,340
he is telling me not to defend his son

499
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,180
and this money is...

500
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,980
we got this coz he agreed to it initially.

501
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,680
If you wish, you can talk to his father.

502
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,880
You'll understand better!

503
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,860
Why is he acting too forthright?

504
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,455
Above all these police and courts;

505
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,520
there is something called self-consciousness

506
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,240
If my kid did that crime intentionally,

507
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,800
I would send him to jail before you do

508
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,680
If you still think he should be punished..

509
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,360
our lawyer won't defend him either.

510
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,500
You can make sure he get's his term.

511
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,940
Please think once again

512
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,980
my friend...

513
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,600
God is there

514
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,593
Forgot to ask..

515
00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:07,040
where is Bandi Srinu?

516
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,042
His parents freaked out.

517
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,880
Sent him to his sister's place in Bangalore.

518
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,940
Yes bro

519
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,940
Greetings Sir!

520
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,440
Please come sir

521
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,960
Greetings Sir!

522
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,260
Lara, all good?

523
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,180
All good sir!

524
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,520
MLP brother, said good things about you.

525
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,520
I really appreciate your fearlessness, man

526
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,940
You been honest and accepted your mistake

527
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,200
You know my network, don't you?

528
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,959
Whenever you have a problem,

529
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,940
don't hesitate you come to me.

530
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,740
I will take care

531
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,020
ok?

532
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,900
(thank you!)

533
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,920
We can sit and discuss, brother.

534
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,900
Why are you fighting?

535
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,340
This hero committed six murders, right!

536
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,360
Plus,

537
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,240
Benami to an MLA.

538
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,860
If I don't agree..

539
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,500
he will kill me and

540
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,580
make that number seven, apparently!

541
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,420
Let's see

542
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,840
If you get to commit your seventh murder or,

543
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,960
I get to commit my fourth.

544
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
It's not that, brother!

545
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,600
We Cops are here for you all, aren't we?

546
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,940
(laughs)

547
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,360
Good joke, sir!

548
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
Get me that paper.

549
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,120
Siren, listen to me.

550
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,920
brother...

551
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,980
Give me that paper, sir!

552
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,640
give me

553
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,920
This land belongs to you from tomorrow!

554
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,980
If anybody questions you...

555
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,560
tell them Siren is involved in this

556
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,100
let's see

557
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,540
you get to finish your fourth murder or,

558
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
I get to finish my seventh one.

559
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,980
(indistinct chatter of people playing)

560
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,100
Oh no, he missed it again!

561
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,360
Hey buddy, Purna is coming.

562
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,240
Hey, your friend is coming for my friend. Isn't she?

563
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,740
Ofcourse!

564
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,640
Lara knows it too

565
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,720
He failed in it once and

566
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,920
staying away from girls

567
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,300
Tell your friend not to waste her time.

568
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,440
She won't listen

569
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,560
She is already in deep love with him

570
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,080
catch.. catch.. catch...

571
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:08,800
Hey!

572
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,180
Great! He is out.

573
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,040
Now the match is ours.

574
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,600
(chatter continuous)

575
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,920
You said you aren't coming!

576
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,340
Bala...

577
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,660
Mom is calling you.

578
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,460
Coming.

579
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,700
(cheering)

580
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,780
Hey, you came for Lara, didn't you?

581
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,160
Bala..

582
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,080
Mom is angry.

583
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,900
Just one more Over, sister! I'll be there.

584
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,480
If you like him so much, why don't tell him that?

585
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,200
(cheering)

586
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,440
Hey.. Lara..

587
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,140
Come here

588
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,200
What happened, sir?

589
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,240
Sub-Inspector sir asked for you, let's go.

590
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,760
It's been 6 months since the case was closed.

591
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,600
what is it now?

592
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,980
Let's go to the station.

593
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,500
Make a list of the things you lost in each shop.

594
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,000
Ok, sir!

595
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,800
ok

596
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,500
You have to take care of this issue.

597
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,340
Mr. Ramadas..

598
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,340
Don't worry about this anymore. Get up.

599
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,980
Get up, sir

600
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,840
I will take care of it, ok!

601
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,640
You go home

602
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,340
Sir!

603
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,840
yes.

604
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,460
Did you ask for me?

605
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,140
Hey!

606
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,820
Well..

607
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,900
That blade batch roam around in your area, right!

608
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,120
Uh. Yes sir

609
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,100
Usually, at what time they are active?

610
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,220
At nights, between 10.30 PM and 12 AM sir..

611
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,280
I need detailed information on their timings and movements.

612
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,320
Lara..

613
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,340
Please help me in this one case

614
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,880
I will stay supportive to you for anything.

615
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,160
Ok sir

616
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,600
Ok, be on that task.

617
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,860
Hey Suri..

618
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,940
We shouldn't get caught to police at any cost guys..

619
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,480
Ok, brother.

620
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,320
Where are you going? You.. stop.

621
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,240
You are shop-lifting in my area?

622
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,320
Thank you, Lara!

623
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,640
I will call you tomorrow

624
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,600
(chuckles)

625
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,820
I will just come back

626
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,740
Careful man. Stay bold.

627
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,940
what's your name?

628
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,560
Poorna

629
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,120
What? What happened?

630
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,080
Sandhya's father is here

631
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,840
Turn around

632
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,580
Why are you tensed?

633
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,460
What happened now?

634
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,100
Someone's coming to see me day after.

635
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,700
If that goes further, I will kill myself.

636
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,200
hey

637
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,000
We will definitely get married.

638
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,180
Don't you trust me?

639
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,860
3 Lakhs

640
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,520
Our CI is very concerned about his part of the nobble

641
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,910
You did improve his business.

642
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,540
Am sure profits might have increased too

643
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,160
Increase our amount from next month

644
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,580
Sandhya..

645
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,320
Your dad just left from here

646
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,120
Dad?

647
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,060
Move aside.

648
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,720
come.. let's go..

649
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,320
Get started. let's go

650
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,880
hey..

651
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,180
They'll never change, man

652
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,540
Hello, brother!

653
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,000
Lara, my little brother...

654
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,980
no. This isn't good

655
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,700
We have a rally day after, dear!

656
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,280
We should be ready with our batch

657
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,360
This is no good either

658
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,360
Looking at our strength in Vijayawada,

659
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,760
chief minister

660
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,400
should keep that corporator Balaraju aside and

661
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,200
make friends with us.

662
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,600
Ok brother. Why not.

663
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,563
I will tell our people.

664
00:32:39,563 --> 00:32:41,280
I will get everything ready. Don't worry.

665
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,420
Bye, dear!

666
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:48,500

Remove this guys..

674
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,280
Get the bike off..

675
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,900
Brother...

676
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,160
Oh god!

677
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,440
Mission Impossible

678
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,940
You idiot!

679
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,200
(laughter)

680
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,960
You messed up everything

681
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,580
Hey, hi!

682
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,540
How are you?

683
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,360
Hey, that's Sandhya's father.

684
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,460
Get up!

685
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,280
Hey

686
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,640
You street dog!

687
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,020
You want my daughter?

688
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,100

689
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,140

690
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,420
Aye

00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Your daughter loved my friend too. Get your facts right!

692
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,660
So, you are leader to this batch?

693
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,820
You think you are a hero?

694
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,320
huh!

695
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,340
Why are you still talking to him, brother?

696
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:52,820
Yes!

697
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,840
I am the hero!

698
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,740
Come. Touch him and show me now

699
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,500
Touch him

700
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,680
Not now

701
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,700
I will see you in the police station

702
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,100
Let's see right now!

703
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,529
I will come to any police station.

704
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:08,820
Right still moment.

705
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,840
Let's meet again

706
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,420
Let's meet

707
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,000
What sir? That Ramadas gave any complaint?

708
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,220
I just gave him a tight...

709
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,320
Lara..

710
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,300
What are you staring at? you...

711
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,760
What are you staring at?

712
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,400
You said you'll decide in any police station?

713
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,500
You think Cops are your family friends?

714
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,900
You dirt bag..

715
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,040
I been nice to you and you start taking it for granted?

716
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,540
(spits)

717
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,520
Now decide you idiot.. decide!

718
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,420
Hey

719
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,060
sir

720
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,900
Give him a dose every hour.

721
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,400
ok, sir!

722
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,840
get up

723
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,640
up.. get up

724
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,340
(spits)

725
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,080
get up

726
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,440
hey, Paparao...

727
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:22,960
sir

728
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,440
sir

729
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
His old college nuisance cases,

730
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,840
didn't he murder someone a while ago?

731
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,580
that case,

732
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,860
turn this case into an attempt-to-murder and related crimes...

733
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,000
create a Rowdy Sheet file on his name.

734
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,700
Yes, sir!

735
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,539
He will not bother your daughter anymore.

736
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:38,660
I will take care of that.

737
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,500
you may go

738
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,380
Bala..

739
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,400
Mom is calling you

740
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,180
Lara, don't you get scared!

741
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,560
Leave this case to me

742
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,620
That bloody SI...

743
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,880
he took our help

744
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,000
but,

745
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,720
he sold himself to that Ramadas.

746
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,680
Our buddy..

747
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,420
They've opened a Rowdy Sheet on our friend.

748
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,060
Those buggers!

749
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,780
Did you ever see someone trusting a Police man?

750
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,120
This SI needs Ramadas more than you.

751
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,240
He bribes that SI with lakhs of money every month.

752
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,040
What do you give him?

753
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,280
Except these empty beer bottles..

754
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,880
So, he trashed you and stayed loyal to Ramadas.

755
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,816
If he can pay money,

756
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:55,940
he can change the truth?

757
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,560
You can do anything with money?

758
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,840
yes, of course!

759
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,592
That's why...

760
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,020
He took 2 lakhs for a murder we never did.

761
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,522
Whatever it is,

762
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:03,860
we are not sparing that Ramadas anymore.

763
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,711
It's him or us.

764
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:05,960
We gotta decide today!

765
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,176
We will go to any extent now.

766
00:37:07,176 --> 00:37:09,020
We will get our friend married and show him.

767
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,720
They think we aren't capable, don't they?

768
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,360
huh!

769
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,340
Now... They'll know what we are!

770
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,100
You promise to get us out

771
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,060
We will finish him right this moment.

772
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,309
We just need your nod.

773
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:20,240
He'll be dead today. Tell us, sir!

774
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,980
Stay calm for two days.

775
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,220
Even MLP brother isn't in town.

776
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,740
Let him come back. We'll think of further actions then

777
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:29,940
ok?

778
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,500
It's a human only when there is life force inside the body

779
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,160
It's called a Law only when there is justice in it

780
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,500
To save it's life,

781
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,240
a cat that is trapped in a room

782
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,100
turns into a tiger and reciprocates.

783
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,700
Likewise

784
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,820
to save justice,

785
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,880
human turns into a beast and fights

786
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
What are you looking at?

787
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,780
huh?

788
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,000
Now call that SI

789
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,560
What? You gonna hit?

790
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,400
You filed a case on me?

791
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,840
filed an Attempt to murder case on me?

792
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,520
You think I can't do anything?

793
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,060
get up

794
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,680
get up

795
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,240
I've threatened you

796
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,980
You've filed an attempt to murder case on me

797
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,380
I went to jail. Got my bail and came out

798
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,000
Now I've attempted a murder on you, for real.

799
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,120
Go file a case again!

800
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,560
I will go to jail. Get a bail again and come out

801
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,360
Next time I will kill you for good

802
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,920
I will see who will file case again!

803
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,080
Hey, get out

804
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,820
go.

805
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,180
go get your SI here

806
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,560
Come on.

807
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,680
File a case again.

808
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,660
That SI will come here,

809
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,560
you should file a again and

810
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,620
I should kill you

811
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,740
Get him here

812
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,820
Let that chump come here

813
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,480
brother.. brother

814
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,740
What happened?

815
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,120
uh.. Nothing happened

816
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,000
First take me to a clinic

817
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,720
Take me to a clinic..

818
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,552
Hey, You are going to marry your girlfriend.

819
00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:23,340
Let's see who can stop that

820
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
Did you find any information?

821
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,940
I am on it

822
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,780
I will call you back

823
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,440
ok

824
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,600
Sir.. sir

825
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,960
We are not supposed to trace calls with out CP's permission

826
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,900
It is not right sir.

827
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,300
It's illegal sir. Let's stop doing it now.

828
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,900
Hey

829
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,680
I know that

830
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,800
I am a cop too

831
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,380
sir?

832
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,360
You go on

833
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,600
Your daughter is a major

834
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,880
and that guy too

835
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,700
Whatever action we take at this time

836
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,220
the entire case will go against you

837
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,280
Little brother...

838
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,240
Brother, please come

839
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:51,780
How are you?

840
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,300
Am good

841
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,660
and the wedding arrangements?
Everything is good

842
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,380
No problem right!

843
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:54,880
No

844
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,620
Ok

845
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,178
You smashed it man!

846
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,760
Ramadas got a cold sweat because of you

847
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,940
Brother...

848
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,780
The day you strike a fight with Ramadas,

849
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,300
you became a huge star over night in Vijayawada.

850
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,000
Last night a man came to me and said,

851
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,319
Sir, can you please make me meet Lara,

852
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:15,700
I have a financial matter to settle.

853
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,580
If you agree,

854
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,580
I will arrange a meeting for you two for that settlement.

855
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,140
If you get a problem, me and lawyer will take care of it

856
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,480
what is a settlement, brother?

857
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,660
What else? Fixing your own justice.

858
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,420
Not like that

859
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,800
My little brother is massy.

860
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,440
We should explain him in detail.

861
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,040
Now your friend is here

862
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,880
what did you do?

863
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,687
when he told you

864
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:34,260
he wants to marry his girlfriend, Ramadas' daughter

865
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,367
No matter how much Ramadas threatened you,

866
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:38,000
even if he send you to jail,

867
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,600
what did you do?

868
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,741
You broke his bones,

869
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:41,136
brought his daughter and

870
00:41:41,136 --> 00:41:42,880
got your friend married to her

871
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,600
What do you call that?

872
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,760
Settlement

873
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,880
You are settling your friend's life

874
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,620
Do you realize the value of 'Settlement'?

875
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,420
A minister,

876
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,080
doesn't proceed legally when there is a glitch

877
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,227
He'll come to you and say

878
00:41:54,227 --> 00:41:55,740
'Hey Lara, please settle my problem'

879
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,880
Say our DSP got any problem,

880
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,276
he'll request our lawyer

881
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,720
to get you involve and settle that matter.

882
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,380
Its got a lot of demand, brother.

883
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,460
Just like we have a police station in every vicinity,

884
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,174
we have someone like you everywhere to settle things.

885
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,580
That is how country is set off peacefully.

886
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,820
Look here

887
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,300
There is a guy

888
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,120
He requested for a settlement

889
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,260
Call him

890
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,400
If you settle his problem...

891
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,760
his troop joins us too

892
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,580
We will grow powerful

893
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,180
In this city, you will be a

894
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,740
Top don

895
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,700
You will be the one for Vijayawada.

896
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,820
If you say Yes, we will unite and grow high, Lara

897
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,520
Are you ok?

898
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,740
Are you ok?

899
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,600
Yes

900
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,480
Yes Ok! Vijayawada is ours now.

901
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,040
Each experience gives us a different emotion

902
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,680
Gust is one of them

903
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,989
Gust looks at the past.

904
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:52,980
Thoughtfulness looks at the future.

905
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,263
Reaching sensibility is

906
00:42:54,263 --> 00:42:56,160
only possible by coming over gust.

907
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,140
But Lara..

908
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,560
chose to go with the gust

909
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,580
I am a cement and iron dealer sir.

910
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,320
6 months ago,

911
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,380
to a dealer named Samba,

912
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,640
I've sent goods worth 6 lakhs

913
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,157
The constriction work is done.

914
00:43:08,157 --> 00:43:09,320
But he is not paying me

915
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,680
He is threatening me when I ask him pay

916
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,240
I tried to complain to police.

917
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,320
But they took bribes and frightening me.

918
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,620
Please do justice to me

919
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,900
Let's go let's go

920
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,780
Like a thunder clap

921
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,920
against the attacking gloom

922
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,660
throw a trap of firestorm

923
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,780
Let's go let's go

924
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,760
Like a wave in the ocean

925
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,580
no matter who is the opposition

926
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,720
rage like a storm

927
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,580
Ask him

928
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,220
Brother, pay me back

929
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,359
If you want to get paid, go to court or police station.

930
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,340
I don't have money.

931
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,040
For him, I am court and I am the policed station

932
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,880
I am telling you

933
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,740
Pay him back

934
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,120
You can't scare with those looks. Pay him back

935
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,400
(chuckles)

936
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,480
You, ankle-biter!

937
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,080
Everyone feels like a goon with four kids behind him

938
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,020
(laughs)

939
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,280
Oh god!

940
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,180
Pay him back!

941
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,660
Let's go Let's go

942
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,720
Like a thunder clap

943
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,760
against the attacking gloom

944
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,320
throw a trap of firestorm

945
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,880
Let's go let's go

946
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,720
like a wave in the ocean

947
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,700
no matter who is the opposition

948
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
rage like a storm

949
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,200
Challenging the high sky

950
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,100
not listening to anything

951
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,985
The speed flowing in our nerves

952
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,860
don't know any boundaries

953
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,840
Hey

954
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,243
It's a mistake.

955
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:03,080
If you want to go past me

956
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:03,900
Hey

957
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,800
It's dangerous

958
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,000
If you ask for a fight

959
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,000
If you don't listen to what I say

960
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,880
That is your conclusion right there

961
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,800
Let's go Let's go

962
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,680
Like a thunder clap

963
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,840
against the attacking gloom

964
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,280
throw a trap of firestorm

965
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,180
Greeting, brother!

966
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,180
greetings

967
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,880
Greetungs, sir!

968
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,860
This is my daughter

969
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,520
we gave 10 lakhs dowry to her husband during the wedding.

970
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,220
Don't hurt her
Get lost you old hog

971
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,360
Dad..

972
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,620
come you...

973
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,460
get going

974
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,820
Hey you...

975
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,260
You won a job silently

976
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,620
hey hey come here

977
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,920
you won a great job, man

978
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,660
Hey tuck-in your shirt first!

979
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,220
He is taking us for granted day by day!

980
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,440
Give his 2 more days and...
hey...

981
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,520
Why are you going for these fights, dear?

982
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,300
Please listen to your dad and go for a job.

983
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,120
Brother, This is our man, Radhakrishna.

984
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,260
He stays in Patamata Lanka

985
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,580
owns a timber depot

986
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,060
struggling financially

987
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,500
He took some mortgage from Uma Maheswara Rao for 5 Lakhs

988
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,300
Now he went to clear his debt

989
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,440
offered that 5 lakhs

990
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,792
That guy changed the number from 5 to 50 and

991
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:03,840
says he won't give the depot back until he pays 50 lakhs.

992
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,880
I have got sword blinds around me,

993
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,560
I am seizing the boundaries

994
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,440
We have enough courage to surpass all of them

995
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,660
The dream that is hidden behind the eyes somewhere

996
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:21,860
we will make it come true with our intense foot steps.

997
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:29,020
If occupying this timber depot for 5 lakhs isn't wrong,

998
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,840
killing you for the same 5 Lakhs won't be a mistake too

999
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:42,220
our hero's movie will definitely run for 100 days.

1000
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,140
you are welcome to place your bets

1001
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,920
Ravi, which bike shall I get on?

1002
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,140
Lara, give Poorna a ride

1003
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,340
(cheering)

1004
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,400
Brother...

1005
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,160
Our man here is Brahmam

1006
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,420
from the traders caste

1007
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,020
stays in Machavaram

1008
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,600
He's got some land there

1009
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,840
Corporator Balaraju is constructing an apartment next to it

1010
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,240
He asked for our guy's land too

1011
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,020
but for a very less price

1012
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,420
Someone else offered him more money

1013
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,877
He is not letting his sell for profit,

1014
00:48:30,877 --> 00:48:32,180
he is not ready to pay fair price.

1015
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,340
Game is over for Balaraju

1016
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,300
Brother...

1017
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,380
Am not sure if he is goofing up looking at you or

1018
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,280
goofing up for you.

1019
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,340
But what he is doing is Wrong.

1020
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,140
wrong

1021
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,400
I only want justice

1022
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,500
If I do mistakes,

1023
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,860
I should be able to go to voters again, right

1024
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,520
I want justice too, brother!

1025
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,720
Today he is intoxicated with Truthfulness

1026
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,540
Disturbing him is dangerous for us

1027
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,620
Let's leave him for a while.

1028
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,140
Hey pal!

1029
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,620
Even though we are fighting for justice,

1030
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,940
there is a limit for everything

1031
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,780
We shouldn't fight beyond out limitations

1032
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,020
It's dangerous for us

1033
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,960
Why do need limits for justice, pal?

1034
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,160
You only need courage

1035
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,560
How do I explain to make you understand?

1036
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,660
God, save my kid!

1037
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,040
Please come sir, what can I get you?

1038
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,880
How much for KG?

1039
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,160
Take it sir, how many kilos?

1040
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,500
Everything

1041
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,840
I want everything!

1042
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,560
You are selling few and not selling a few'

1043
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,800
That's not right business

1044
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,320
She is new, guys.

1045
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,380
She'll learn soon

1046
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,200
If she doesn't learn,

1047
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,260
we will teach her

1048
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,440
You don't have to pay fees too

1049
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,160
In fact, we will pay you.

1050
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,020
What is your problem?

1051
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,420
hey!

1052
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,520
What is your problem ?

1053
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,660
I've slept with 60 females till now

1054
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,040
Only one night per woman

1055
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,280
But i spent 6 months for you

1056
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,680
I been roaming around you for 6 months

1057
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:23,760
Hey!

1058
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,600
What's wrong with me?

1059
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,140
Look.. I've got money

1060
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,640
I am 6 feet tall

1061
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,760
What else do you want?

1062
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,200
Here.. take all this money

1063
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,620
This is a blank cheque. Fill whatever number you want.

1064
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,500
I am giving you 10 more minutes

1065
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,780
Just 10 minutes.

1066
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,240
If you don't agree,

1067
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,120
I will just carry you off

1068
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,420
hey, who is it hitting our guy?

1069
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,240
ACP Rama Chandra.

1070
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:41,880
So?

1071
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,360
Say one more word, you'll sit naked there.

1072
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:47,840
Ramya...

1073
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:48,520
Sir.

1074
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,860
You come with me dear. Sir will take care of him.

1075
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,120
Who is the uncle here?

1076
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,007
come forward.

1077
00:51:56,007 --> 00:51:56,500

1078
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,440
This money was given by your guy.

1079
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,160
please come here

1080
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,040
Sir.. sir, I made a mistake.

1081
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,940
sir, please sir.

1082
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,080
sorry sir

1083
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,800
Sir, please don't hit us

1084
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,820
Pavan Kumar alias Lara, is it you?

1085
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,060
Go, sit there

1086
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,700
Greetings, brother!

1087
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:46,540
come.

1088
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:48,820
Brother,

1089
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,080
This is very normal qoutine

1090
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,860
Every time a new office joins,

1091
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,020
they call us like this

1092
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,360
give us a warning

1093
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,580
we listen to it and go back

1094
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,080
Siren Ramesh, isn't it?

1095
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,320
go that side.

1096
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:00,900
Hello Siren.

1097
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,400
hi

1098
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,220
He is Siren. a very big rowdy sheeter in the city.

1099
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,680
Whatever fights happens in the city

1100
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,420
they will have to come to him

1101
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,140
and he settles the scraps

1102
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,360
Alla, jesus, all hail lord shiva!

1103
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,360
Veeradas, write down!

1104
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,040
oh wow

1105
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,480
Everybody is here already

1106
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,540
I know you'll come

1107
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,400
Greetings, sir!

1108
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,400
Sir,

1109
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,540
There is absolutely no need for you to arrange meetings

1110
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,900
We all got to know ACP sir's sincerity.

1111
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,500
I am just coming back from prayer, asking god to keep ACP sir here.

1112
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,360
please take it sir.

1113
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,860
What is this man?

1114
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:31,872
Usually goons wish

1115
00:53:31,872 --> 00:53:34,120
the sincere officers to get transferred soon

1116
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,820
Why are you wishing him to stay?

1117
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,440
sir..

1118
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,180
I thought the same at the beginning

1119
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,200
If we are good with police, they'll help with cases

1120
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,160
But revenges,

1121
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,040
they come till here.

1122
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,960
If we are destined, we live or we die.

1123
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,660
That's why, I wish ACP sir stays here for ever.

1124
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,140
Manikanta, right!

1125
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,140
Please go inside.

1126
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,560
Greetings, brother!

1127
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,720
They called you too?

1128
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,200
please sit.

1129
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,520
Greetings, brother!

1130
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,620
He is Mani.

1131
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,740
an old rowdy sheeter

1132
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,140
He was whip-smart in his time.

1133
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,100
Now turned calm like a saint.

1134
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:14,660
Greetings, sir!

1135
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,700
All have turned up?

1136
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,140
Sir, one guy named Raju didn't turn out.

1137
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:19,660
Raju?

1138
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,820
He says, he'll make his MP talk to us.

1139
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,460
MP?

1140
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,700
Who is MP?

1141
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,660
He should be here in an hour.

1142
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,260
Sir.

1143
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,160
get going!

1144
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,680
Sir!

1145
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,596
They are all of them.

1146
00:54:32,596 --> 00:54:34,060
What do we do them sir?

1147
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,560
(chuckles) what do we do sir?

1148
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,020
For a human to live with humanity,

1149
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,200
we wrote Bhagavadgeeta, Bible and Quran.

1150
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,580
Since they are painting them with religion and it isn't enough,

1151
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,760
we wrote a constitution too.

1152
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,980
If that isn't enough too,

1153
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,340
they need something else.

1154
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,840
send them off sir.

1155
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,600
Manikanta! alias, Mani.

1156
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,720
Nearly 10 years

1157
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,060
9 Murder cases,

1158
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,880
6 attempt to murder cases

1159
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,300
15 settlement cases

1160
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,520
you left everything and living peacefully.

1161
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,980
How does it feel now?

1162
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,280
I wonder how did I live so far?

1163
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,300
back then,

1164
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,400
with a bad rage,

1165
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,940
to achieve something

1166
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,400
I took the weapon.

1167
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,820
If I turn around and see,

1168
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,840
except the wonds on my body

1169
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,980
and some vengeance in society,

1170
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,040
I have nothing else left.

1171
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,140
But, how did you change suddenly?

1172
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,540
Two...

1173
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,420
three years ago,

1174
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,600
I was taking my daughter fir 1oth standard board exams...

1175
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,860
they've attacked.

1176
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,600
hey..
daddy!
hey..

1177
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,700
don't hurt my father...

1178
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,720
leave me man!

1179
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,400
I was scared

1180
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,080
we were admitted in a clinic

1181
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,060
'Why did they stab you daddy?'

1182
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,300
my daughter asked me.

1183
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,900
I didn't have answer to that.

1184
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,680
29 cases in total.

1185
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,620
25 cases were closed.

1186
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:10,580
2 Murder & 2 Attempt to murder cases are still in pending.

1187
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,180
How did you manage to solve all those cases?

1188
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,360
MLA sir gathered everyone personally

1189
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,000
I paid monetary compensation to a few people.

1190
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,640
I can't give the lives back

1191
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,860
few people

1192
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,660
asked me to touch their feet

1193
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,760
I did.

1194
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,260
(laughing)

1195
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:45,900
(Mani touched my feet.)

1196
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,640
(creepy laughs)

1197
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,060
(Go live you son of ....)

1198
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,740
Few other people,

1199
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,180
my...

1200
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,860
asked for my life

1201
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,840
(would we leave you?)

1202
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,280
(Do we spare him if he touch our feet?)

1203
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,060
(No)

1204
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,880
(We want his life)

1205
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,120
Them... for my life,

1206
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,360
Me, for their forgiveness...

1207
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,620
we both are waiting, sir!

1208
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,620
You frightened a lot of people

1209
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,960
How will the trust you anymore?

1210
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,000
In times where humans can't believe each other,

1211
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,140
who will trust Goons like us and why?

1212
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,420
Any how,

1213
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,700
Your efforts are good.

1214
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,720
But ensure I don't hear your name again!

1215
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,920
Please go now.

1216
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:45,740
very well

1217
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,800
look at his looks. why is it so creepy?

1218
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,260
see this

1219
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,800
Let's listen to his track record

1220
00:57:58,740 --> 00:57:59,620
6 murders

1221
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,620
8 kidnaps

1222
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,300
4 attempt to murders

1223
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,660
approximately 20 settlement cases in the last 4 years.

1224
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,480
Maintaining an amazing track record.

1225
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,960
How much did you earn?

1226
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,472
He've earned so much

1227
00:58:10,472 --> 00:58:11,940
If he steps out, some one might kill him...

1228
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,620
He stays home all day. He've earned that much fear.

1229
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,960
Government pays me salary to live

1230
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,920
and gives me guns to kill people like you.

1231
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,680
What do you want and what you want to me use

1232
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,600
you can decide that yourself.

1233
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,040
Did you get it?

1234
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,540
go now.

1235
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,120
You understand what I am telling youj?

1236
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,000
Pavan kumar alias Lara

1237
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:33,740
Lara

1238
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,820
Intermediate state second ranker

1239
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,840
Getting used to settlements now

1240
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:39,900
is it?

1241
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,040
Settlement means bringing someone out of troubles

1242
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,240
and showing him a way to live.

1243
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,400
but why are you

1244
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,680
showing someone a way to live while

1245
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,340
finding a way to die for yourself?

1246
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,860
Who will do your settlement?

1247
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,400
huh?

1248
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,820
Sir, Raju is here sir.

1249
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,120
Who is MP?

1250
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,160
Who is that MP?

1251
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,060
Sir, it's not that...

1252
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,440
You are asked about MP, so talk only about that.

1253
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,320
Bring him in at the end.

1254
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:04,860
ok sir.

1255
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,360
move

1256
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,040
You wont understand a word I tell you

1257
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,260
I know what will you become by the time you understand

1258
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,900
committing mistakes isn't so bad.

1259
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,440
but making it a habit is.

1260
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,800
a crime.

1261
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,440
I am giving you 4 months.

1262
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,000
If you repeat this again,

1263
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,960
I won't give you 4 minutes too..

1264
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,740
understand?

1265
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:31,920
go now

1266
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,500
M. Leela Prasad Alias MLP

1267
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,080
sir!

1268
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,180
Hello Mr. MLP

1269
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,820
You seem to be good mood

1270
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,220
I hear you are conducting marriages, protests

1271
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,240

1272
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,740
May be he wants to become an MLA.

1273
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,860
My India is the greatest!

1274
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:53,506
Hail state Andhra!

1275
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,260
Hail state Telangana!

1276
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,080
MLP brother will come too. Let's wait for him.

1277
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,220
Looks like he is getting his share of the dosage too

1278
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,620
One... Two... Three... harder!

1279
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,220
Brother

1280
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,760
Our MLP brother isn't coming out yet. Why?

1281
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,220
He will come man.

1282
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:07,780
ouch

1283
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,180
33, 34, 35, 36

1284
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,200
Want to take a break?

1285
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,100
Yes, sir!

1286
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,280
Thank you sir!
ok.

1287
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,900
Bro, my brother isn't coming out yet!

1288
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,220
He will come man.

1289
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,440
They aren't going to bash your boss him inside.

1290
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,060
Start

1291
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,200
One!

1292
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,060
huh?

1293
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,300
One?

1294
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,220
Sir, wasn't that 37?

1295
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,180
Didn't we tell you it'll start over if you take breaks?

1296
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:30,860
Sir...!

1297
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,240
I fold my hands for you and your leather belts.

1298
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,000
I will do whatever you say from today, sir
!

1299
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:40,880
Look...

1300
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,580
Whenever we meet, it will be exactly like this.

1301
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,540
you decide.

1302
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,620
Whether you want to meet me here?

1303
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,820
or you want to meet Lara outside.

1304
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:50,900
Your call.

1305
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,820
Bro, what did he say?

1306
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,760
Little brother,

1307
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,622
Until I tell you,

1308
01:01:00,622 --> 01:01:02,840
none of you try to reach me.

1309
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:04,920
Don't call me.

1310
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,220
Don't text me.

1311
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,880
Don't ping me on whatsapp.

1312
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,720
Don't try to meet me too.

1313
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,240
Love you, dear!

1314
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,120
It is unnecessary for us to know if the ACP is a good person or a bad one?

1315
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,680
He worked in 8 locations till dat.

1316
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,600
Looks like he has always been sincere everywhere.

1317
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,100
As long as he is here

1318
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,780
It's better to stay alert.

1319
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,000
New ACP Rajendra entered into the city.

1320
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,740
He declared war on illegal forces.

1321
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,087
He have announced that

1322
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,780
no one is allowed to be seen on roads post 10 PM

1323
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:37,140
Even Political leaders are being watchful about ACP.

1324
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,280
Whatever we believe, that is our life.

1325
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,940
But, we need to choose our beliefs very carefully.

1326
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,600
Otherwise, Nectar can turn into poison and

1327
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,060
Good can turn into Bad.

1328
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,200
All the rowdy sheeters in the city

1329
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,800
believed ACP's sincerity

1330
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,580
and took a step down.

1331
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,060
Except Lara.

1332
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:58,780
Call him.

1333
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:05,600
Yes!

1334
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,300
Pay me back, brother.

1335
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,560
Hey, how many time I told you? put the phone down.

1336
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:10,860
He denied.

1337
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:13,500
Call him again!

1338
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,560
He have disconnected the call.

1339
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,520
It's 4 Lakhs in total. Pay me back.

1340
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,700
Yes, you were saying...

1341
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,280
Yes brother, about Balayya...

1342
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,100
Brother, give that man his money

1343
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,200
What did he tell you?

1344
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,080
Brother!

1345
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,240
You...

1346
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:14,900
I will pay.

1347
01:03:15,327 --> 01:03:16,120
I will give.

1348
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,700
Sir, please leave me sir!

1349
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,740
If things go wrong,

1350
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,280
you'll be behind the bars before your father.

1351
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:26,820
Hello!

1352
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,200
Fight?

1353
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,480
Don't you understand?

1354
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,220
Why did you hit Siren?

1355
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,940
You think that ACP will spare you?

1356
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,220
Hey, if he wants to arrest, let him do.

1357
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:36,100
We'll take care of it later.

1358
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,540
What will we take care of?

1359
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,720
He won't give make you sit and treat you well

1360
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,300
He is not currept like that SI.

1361
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,180
If he takes you to station,

1362
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,940
he will make you confess the fight within 30 mins

1363
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,400
Alright, what do we do now?

1364
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,380
You should ask this before hitting him.

1365
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,920
Stay out of sight for a few days

1366
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,220
We can't do anything more now!

1367
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,920
Don't get out until I call you.

1368
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:58,780
move

1369
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:12,500
Sir,

1370
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,820
He owes money to someone.

1371
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:14,700
That man brought Lara

1372
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,880
Who started the fight?

1373
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:16,800
Lara

1374
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,360
Catch him

1375
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,320
Hey pal!

1376
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:25,060
I will be in city outskirts for 4 days

1377
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,680
No one shall call me over phone

1378
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,480
If there is anything, come and meet me directly.

1379
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,620
Are you all clear about it?

1380
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,640
Don't you understand?

1381
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,380
Don't you understand that ACP is very sincere?

1382
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:34,900
Hey

1383
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,760
Don't you remember that SI?

1384
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,100
He is just another police like him.

1385
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,940
Everyone acts sincere in the beginning.

1386
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,160
Just wait for 6 months.

1387
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,460
Wait for 6 months.

1388
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,060
Then you'll understand.

1389
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,320
Is that it?

1390
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,940
You will be like this all your life?

1391
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:50,500
You'll keep escaping from police?

1392
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,080
I am leaving

1393
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:58,820
move

1394
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,680
Leave them out of this

1395
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,240
I will come with you

1396
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,260
Sir...

1397
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,520
No one will file case on Lara, as long as you are around.

1398
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,680
Because, there is MLA Veerabhadram involved.

1399
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,960
How are you now?

1400
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,300
I shouldn't come when Police are here.

1401
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,720
That's why my visit is delayed.

1402
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,400
Half of MLA's properties are

1403
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,060
on Siren's name.

1404
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:47,720
Siren is his Benami, sir!

1405
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,100
If you file ny case now,

1406
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,500
that Lara will

1407
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,540
make another victim to file against you.

1408
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,180
You'll treat case like a case

1409
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,900
and go arrest Siren.

1410
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,680
If that happens, it'll be difficult to bring you into politics

1411
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,060
Once the ACP is transferred, within an hour,

1412
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,680
we will take care of Lara.

1413
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,720
I will take leave sir!

1414
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,720
Take care
!

1415
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,940
I will take care of it

1416
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:07,980
Brother,

1417
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,440
If we keep calm, we'll take us for granted.

1418
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,980
If we let him go, he'll keep making noise.

1419
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:16,440
He'll stay in his limits only if we give him a strong attack.

1420
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:17,800
Balaraju,

1421
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,360
You must hit the wise one with trust

1422
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,880
but you should hit the fearless one with patience.

1423
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,600
We will get a chnce too

1424
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,500
Sir,

1425
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,940
this is not how we deal with him, sir!

1426
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,940
Send him off

1427
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,040
Sir, everyone is here.

1428
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:44,860
Hey

1429
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,280
Why did I gather you all here,

1430
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,980
am sure you know it by now.

1431
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,820
What will you do if a wild beast entered a town?

1432
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,220
We will put it in a cage, sir.

1433
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,780
Then why are you all hanging out with Lara?

1434
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,740
He turned into a beast and scaring people...

1435
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:04,240
Instead of keeping him away,

1436
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,700
you are being friends with him?

1437
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,800
You are drinking beers with him in bars?

1438
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,580
'We will be with Lara', 'We will die for Lara',

1439
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,720
if someone feels that way, please step forward

1440
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,480
If I find any of you hanging with him,

1441
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,640
If I see you with him,

1442
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,780
even if you receive his phone call,

1443
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,760
I will open a rowdy sheet on all of you.

1444
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,840
If I see him in your bar again,

1445
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,480
If you let him sit in your bar,

1446
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,760
it'll be seized immediately.

1447
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,140
This is your last warning!

1448
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:37,540
Along with me, you will be the one to do justice to people.

1449
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,120
Greetings, dear!

1450
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,800
You continue doing your work.

1451
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,500
If anyone asks you,

1452
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,740
tell them Lara is with you.

1453
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:47,980
Ok, sir! Thank you.

1454
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:49,580
Dear,

1455
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,460
You and me are from here

1456
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,420
that ACP is here today and leaves tomorrow

1457
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,720
Looks like he called my brother the other day

1458
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,640
and warned him.

1459
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,380
He said you've turned this bar into your hub.

1460
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,120
Be nice and as long as he is here,

1461
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,640
please don't mind

1462
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,380
don't come to this bar.

1463
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:47,360
Why?

1464
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:06,960
Lara..

1465
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,380
I.. I don't mean to...

1466
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,760
Come with me.

1467
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,220
Hey .. Hey...

1468
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,260
Lara... Lara...

1469
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:15,840
Stop yar. listen to me.

1470
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,740
Let's not fight with that ACP.

1471
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,560
Hey! that ACP scared you all, right!

1472
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,500
Now I will scare him.

1473
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,940
I'll show you, come!!!

1474
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,060
Come...

1475
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:29,960
Lara..

1476
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,420
Lara... wait..

1477
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,300
Oh god! He will make a mess today

1478
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,180
Hello!

1479
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:41,840
Lara.

1480
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,260
No Lara. Listen to me

1481
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,800
Lara, stop.

1482
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:45,580
Hey!

1483
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,640
It's Lara.

1484
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,460
Hello!

1485
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:08,020
You warned me friend not to hang with me.

1486
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,540
I am your target. Aren't I?

1487
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,160
I am waiting for you in the Center of the city.

1488
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,740
Come. Let's see if you can scare me or I will scare you

1489
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:21,240
Come if you have guts.

1490
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:22,620
Shiva,

1491
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,180
Get the vehicle out.

1492
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,180
I beg you, let's go!

1493
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,880
What happened, man?

1494
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:39,420
He called that ACP and challenged him to come here.

1495
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:42,560
Hey, what is this? Let's go!

1496
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,079
Let's go.

1497
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,980
I will touch your feet. Let's go!

1498
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,040
We will go.

1499
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,240
Guys, ACP is coming.

1500
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,700
He is coming. Let's go.

1501
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,200
Who are you to threaten us?

1502
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,860
Who the hell are you to threaten us?

1503
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,980
Who are you?

1504
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:17,380
You've got avarice for 5, 10 thousand.

1505
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:19,240
Gets yourself transferred to wherever you get enough bribe.

1506
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,460
Who are you to threaten us?

1507
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:24,660
You will scare me?

1508
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,340
Come.

1509
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:26,480
Come and scare me.

1510
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,260
Come

1511
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:28,520
Why are we still discussing with him sir?

1512
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,240
Let's take to the station and smash him

1513
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:30,820
Yes!

1514
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,900
I am waiting for it too. Come!

1515
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,900
Any man with guts can come inside.]

1516
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,860
Are the vehicles ready?

1517
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,500
Ready, sir!

1518
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,940
Did you check them?

1519
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:09,620
They are ok sir.

1520
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:11,680
Ok.

1521
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:14,960
Sir!

1522
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,560
Lara, you are too young.

1523
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,700
You've got a lot of future ahead!

1524
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,380
They want to frame you somehow

1525
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,660
and close your chapter.

1526
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:31,040
Do something and get away from here.

1527
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,960
I can only suggest this as an elderly man

1528
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,260
Get going.

1529
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:39,960
Please give me this one chance

1530
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,820
Else it gets tougher sir!

1531
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,720
Hey!

1532
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:49,880
Gun down!

1533
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:52,480
Guns Down!

1534
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:19,980
Are you ok?

1535
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:21,580
Ramesh, are you ok?

1536
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,300
Ok, sir!

1537
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,240
Is it a mistake to make him go?

1538
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:31,480
No

1539
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,360
He doesn't have fear for police.

1540
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,280
He's got that fear now.

1541
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,200
That's what I want too!

1542
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,760
Lara alias Pavan Kumar who fought with ACP last night

1543
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,760
is suspected to get encountered

1544
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,540
Let's ask his friends for more details.

1545
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:03,040
We respect ACP sir and we trust him as well.

1546
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,080
But we aren't moving from here until he show us Lara.

1547
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,820
Commissioner sir is coming, give him way!

1548
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,660
Commissioner sir, one minute!

1549
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,520
Sir, everyone is saying Lara was encountered!

1550
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,520
is it?

1551
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,500
Where did you see his dead body?

1552
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,200
Your answer isn't convincing sir!

1553
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,240
First learn how to question appropriately.

1554
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,560
If you ask sensibly, I'd answer the same way

1555
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,580
Good Morning, sir!

1556
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:24,980
Good morning? what is this new ahbit?

1557
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,500
Look, you've got a fan-base already!

1558
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,080
Didn't I tell you not to risk too much with these goond?

1559
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,560
If that Lara met with any accident now,

1560
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,600
that'll become your headache.

1561
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,560
Police job is full of risks sir!

1562
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,320
Hello!

1563
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:41,180
Lara..

1564
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:50,720
Greetings!

1565
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,740
My name is Lara!

1566
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,180
Last night police tried to encounter and

1567
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:00,220
I escaped from there

1568
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,380
Sir, let's talk about the encounter later

1569
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,360
First of all, what is police duty?

1570
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,740
If someone does any mistake...

1571
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:11,320
you have to arrest them

1572
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,640
and present them at the court.

1573
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:16,460
If their crime is proven, court will punish them.

1574
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,740
But,

1575
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:22,800
Will this happen in any police station?

1576
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:26,700
No

1577
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,720
It is not happening.

1578
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,280
Do you know what happens there?

1579
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,200
huh?

1580
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,320
I will tell you

1581
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,120
Police have absolutely no interest in truth

1582
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,100
That's why if we have money,

1583
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,220
police is always ready to sell himself.

1584
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,500
If we have reputation,

1585
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,860
he is always waiting for a chance to please us.

1586
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,560
Then, he will write as we say...

1587
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,320
and we call that FIR.

1588
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:54,080
For us to live here,

1589
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,080
we should either have money

1590
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,040
or reputation.

1591
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:00,140
If you don't have both...

1592
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:02,520
you should stay shut up in front of everyone.

1593
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,640
or, die in their hands.

1594
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,640
That's all.

1595
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,220
If you escape that, police will encounter you.

1596
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:11,380
That is exactly what happened to me.

1597
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:15,100
This is...

1598
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,340
our police and our constitution.

1599
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,960
Police like this,

1600
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,160
and a constitution like this,

1601
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:26,380
do we need them?

1602
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,700
very well said.

1603
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,700
That's why I set my own rules and

1604
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:31,240
wrote my own constitution.

1605
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,660
And, they name it...

1606
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,340
Rowdyism,

1607
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:36,480
Settlements.

1608
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:41,400
If police are really in a place to punish the crime,

1609
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:45,180
I wouldn't get a need to talk in front of media today!

1610
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,340
If you say Law and Order works for bribes

1611
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,640
and police works for political power;

1612
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,720
We don't need those police and those constitutions.

1613
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,040
Not at all

1614
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,920
Or, is there a police station that doesn't take bribe?

1615
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,620
Is there a police station that doesn't take bribe?

1616
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:01,880
Tell me if there is one.

1617
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,800
I will go surrender myself there.

1618
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,400
The day when Police Station operates without bribe...

1619
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,060
when a cop does his duty sincerely...

1620
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:07,840
I will stop doing all these.

1621
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,400
Until then, I will stay the same.

1622
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,060
Who can control me?

1623
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:15,560
Sir, you have under estimated him.

1624
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,560
You should've killed him when you found him

1625
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,220
Sir, this isn't going to stop here.

1626
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:21,940
If you let them go, everyone in the city will turn violent.

1627
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:23,800
Sir,

1628
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,260
As far as it is Lara's case,

1629
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,580
I shall take risk.

1630
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:28,580
If you give me permission,

1631
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,440
I shall close him within 2 days.

1632
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,680
(Slaps)

1633
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,160
Just because you have a uniform and

1634
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,080
gun in hand, you'll kill anyone?

1635
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,380
If there is a question of killing, it should be to you.

1636
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:42,260
If he was encountered, what would people think?

1637
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:44,060
Do you know?

1638
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:45,140
Since you are sold,

1639
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:46,280
someone like Ramadas commits crime.

1640
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,360
thinking a sold cop can't do justice,

1641
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,620
someone like Lara is committing crime.

1642
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,560
You are the reason for both. Do you know that?

1643
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,200
Because of cops like you,

1644
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,840
to make people believe I am a police,

1645
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,200
nearly my whole service time is spent.

1646
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:00,860
When do I do my duty?

1647
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,980
There are 90,000 cops in state.

1648
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:05,500
9 Crores of Salary per month.

1649
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,040
After all, a female greengrocer doesn't have security here.

1650
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:12,240
This is how we do police duty

1651
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,260
What do we get for sincere duty sir?

1652
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:15,120
Except transfers.

1653
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,600
Or they'll get the one's who'll turn case around for them

1654
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:18,500
Quit it.

1655
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,240
If transfers worry you,

1656
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,420
why do you need this job?

1657
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,040
If you are transferred,

1658
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,660
another police will replace you.

1659
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:25,140
not a politician.

1660
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,040
If every police is sincere in his duty,

1661
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,540
how many cops they'll transfer?

1662
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,320
How many time they'll shift the case?

1663
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,500
The one who is corrupt will always be there.

1664
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,120
He will try to scare you or lure you.

1665
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:39,700
Wear this uniform only if none of them affect you.

1666
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,840
Or resign the job and become a mediator.

1667
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,460
Our duty is not to encourage crime.

1668
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,360
controlling the crime.

1669
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:52,500
You took 2 lakhs from Ramadas and made Lara a goon

1670
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,540
Now I will give you 10 lakhs.

1671
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,320
Turn him back into a human!

1672
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:57,060
Rajendra!

1673
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,180
Man has invented Airplane...

1674
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:01,420
explored universe too...

1675
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,080
Way before all that,

1676
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,460
Knowing there is hatred and revenge in humans,

1677
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,520
they will kill us eventually,

1678
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,860
he have discovered Constitution too.

1679
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,600
Parents give birth to you

1680
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:11,920
Teachers give you knowledge,

1681
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,100
Police gives you protection.

1682
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,660
A human can only live with the help of these three.

1683
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:17,740
Rajender is doing the same duty.

1684
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,640
Stay here only if you can work sincerely.

1685
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,500
Or else,

1686
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,680
admit you are incapable, resign and go away!

1687
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:24,760
Meeting is over!

1688
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,140
Tell me, Lara!

1689
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,320
I called you for bail.

1690
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,700
I already told you.

1691
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,860
We were safe because that SI was a corrupt.

1692
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,840
You'll realize the power of this ACP going further.

1693
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,580
Don't call me anymore.

1694
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,460
You better surrender in the court.

1695
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,760
Then I can arrange the bail.

1696
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:53,920
Meanwhile,

1697
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,020
stay hidden from the police.

1698
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,560
Let's leave them, sir!

1699
01:19:57,820 --> 01:19:59,480
He will definitely surrender himself in the court.

1700
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:01,680
What he thinks is none of our business.

1701
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,420
We will tighten it in our way and bring him to our terms.

1702
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,300
If you don't tell us where is Lara...

1703
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,800
you'll get third degree now!

1704
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,400
Shiva, get it ready for third degree.

1705
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,680
Sir....

1706
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:13,880
Hey, get up.

1707
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:16,900
Yes, tell me.

1708
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:23,040
Sir...

1709
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,840
Our MLP brother knows

1710
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,580
Lara details, sir!

1711
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,200
Brother...

1712
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,220
Oh god!

1713
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,820
I swear, I don't know where is Lara, sir!

1714
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:38,300
I swear on goddess Kanaka Durga.

1715
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,640
If you want, I will walk on fire and prove that!

1716
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,520
What do you mean walking on fire?

1717
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,580
If I am telling you the truth...

1718
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,460
even if I walk on fire, nothing will happen

1719
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:46,900
I won't get hurt. not even a little bit, sir!

1720
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:47,820
I am ready, sir!

1721
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,440
Where do you want me to arrange fire now?

1722
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,460
(cricket commentary)

1723
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,620
Do you watch Cricket?

1724
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:55,940
Yes sir! I like the game very much, sir!

1725
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,140
The match is on.

1726
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,220
Yes, sir!

1727
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:02,160
Do sit ups until they get a wicket.

1728
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,580
If you don't get hurt...
Oh mother!

1729
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,340
I will believe whatever you said.

1730
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,280
Sir...

1731
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,360
In a test match,

1732
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,900
You are asking me do sit ups until they get a wicket?

1733
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,260
Who is batting?

1734
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,160
Ajinkya Rahane, sir!

1735
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,360
He won't give a wicket even for 3 days.

1736
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,920
If I do sit ups until they get a wicket in a test match,

1737
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,220
I will die sir!

1738
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:24,340
That is exactly why I asked you to do sit ups.

1739
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:25,320
Start!

1740
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,000
Guys, who gave in my name?

1741
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,580
At the end,

1742
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,740
is any opposition group from Vijayawada involved in this?

1743
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:39,880
They said third degree.

1744
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,580
I was scared and told them your name, brother!

1745
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:42,440
You son of a...

1746
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,140
If they say third degree, you'll give them brother's name?

1747
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:45,680
We were so tense, brother!

1748
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,500
At least, tell me where is our guy.

1749
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,800
We have no idea, brother!

1750
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,600
You have no idea?

1751
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:51,600
No, brother!

1752
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,260
None of you know it?

1753
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,500
No, brother!
What a unity, guys!

1754
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:59,480
You know an upcoming political leader like me...

1755
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,960
should count on who?

1756
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,780
We should count on people.

1757
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,460
We should count on the followers.

1758
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,080
We can count on money.

1759
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:10,040
We should never count on trouble makers like you.

1760
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,840
The complete information of Lara's friends, sir!

1761
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,740
Who is Bala?

1762
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:15,440
Bala is Poorna's brother sir!

1763
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,220
Who is Poorna now?

1764
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:17,660
Poorna is a girl sir.

1765
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:20,260
Rumor says Lara and Poorna are in love.

1766
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,640
(knocking)

1767
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,460
Please. Don't open the door. it could be cops.

1768
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,000
Please, no. Listen to me.

1769
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:43,080
No. Please. come with me.

1770
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,440
Who is inside? Open the door.

1771
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,700
Open the door.

1772
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,260
What took you so long to open the door?

1773
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,240
I was in the bathroom.

1774
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,780
If you are bathing inside, why did you lock it outside?

1775
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,140
Where are your parents?

1776
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,380
They went to a function.

1777
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:11,780
Go, get dressed and come.

1778
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,180
Do you know Lara?

1779
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:20,920
Yes!

1780
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,680
You know him since how long?

1781
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:23,360
2 years

1782
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:24,320
Are you both in a relationship?

1783
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,260
No.

1784
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,960
We are informed that Lara is here.

1785
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,220
Tell me the truth, or I'll drag you to the station and smack you.

1786
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,840
Narasimha, sir is calling you. come.

1787
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:56,640
come.

1788
01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:06,420
He won't enter the city sir!

1789
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:07,540
He is inside.

1790
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,260
Inside?
Sir, why did you leave him?

1791
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:11,220
That girl is uncomfortable, let it be.

1792
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:12,400
Sir, how can we let him go?

1793
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,160
They say if an irresponsible one get married

1794
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,520
...he might change. This is of some sort.

1795
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,220
Let him go.

1796
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,220
I didn't expect something like this will happen

1797
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,420
It's always dangerous to you

1798
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:32,300
I don't care about all this.

1799
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,560
I've decided to be with you.

1800
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,580
Living one day with you is enough!

1801
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,060
Will you marry me?

1802
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:49,980
I wouldn't marry anyone else.

1803
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,760
Sir, what happened that day?
Please, please, please..

1804
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,120
After presenting Lara in the court,

1805
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,780
I will explain everything to you.

1806
01:24:57,780 --> 01:24:59,140
Please stay patient till then.

1807
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,740
Please move. Lara come.

1808
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,800
Last question sir. Mr. Lara, please say something.

1809
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,040
He looks peaceful.

1810
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,720
May be he is getting married, sir.

1811
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,820
Why? You don't want him to get better?

1812
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:08,740
What did I say, sir?

1813
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,200
Your way of commenting looks like that

1814
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:11,940
You started it.

1815
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,220
I heard that

1816
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,680
That's with in us

1817
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,660
Woke up the dreams,

1818
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,300
Filled the lights,

1819
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,080
This moment is making it true.

1820
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,220
I have witnessed the sweetness of life,

1821
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:21,940
It's the happiness of celebrations.

1822
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,860
The feet never comes back from

1823
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,920
this rush of new journey. Why is that?

1824
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,440
The life came back to me once again

1825
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,800
This is the feeling of new beginnings.

1826
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,560
Every time it is our struggle

1827
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,940
It's the story of the heart that make us walk with it.

1828
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:44,920
Like a dream hidden in your eyes...

1829
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:48,220
This celebration came to us because of that.

1830
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:50,440
I heard that

1831
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:57,000
It is with in us both

1832
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,860
Like a star in the night,

1833
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:41,740
couldn't find a way to you

1834
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,680
I been wandering, all this while

1835
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,000
with breeze as my companion.

1836
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:51,060
I am not mine anymore.

1837
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,860
I couldn't reach you until

1838
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:59,820
the unruly wave inside me, made me walk with you.

1839
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:05,680
In my deserted life, you are the trace of rainfall

1840
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:09,240
Looking at you this moment,

1841
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,140
and comparing it with my heart beat.

1842
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:15,380
Every time it is our struggle.

1843
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:18,200
It's the story of the heart that make us walk with it.

1844
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:21,160
Like a dream hidden in you eyes...

1845
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:24,460
This celebration came to us because of that.

1846
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,360
I heard that

1847
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,720
It is within us

1848
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:59,860
It was strange until yesterday

1849
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,840
I am your shadow now...

1850
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:09,040
the desire to walk with you is chasing me from every side.

1851
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:11,740
I am far away from myself,

1852
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:14,920
but close to your breathe

1853
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,800
once again in every life...

1854
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,040
I want to live peacefully.

1855
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:24,080
I won't ask anything more,

1856
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,760
said my little life.

1857
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,440
All this love,

1858
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:32,880
let's get together and seize it

1859
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,360
Every time it is our struggle.

1860
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,140
It's the story of the heart that make us walk with it.

1861
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:42,060
Like a dream hidden in you eyes...

1862
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:45,660
This celebration came to us because of that.

1863
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,360
I heard that

1864
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:53,640
It is within us

1865
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,180
(Screams)

1866
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,720
(Gasps)

1867
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:21,980
Poorna...

1868
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,180
What happened?

1869
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:26,080
Poorna, what happened?

1870
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:36,120
What happened, Poorna?

1871
01:30:45,340 --> 01:30:47,560
Yes, he is joining today.

1872
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,960
Ok. ok. I will be there by 10.30

1873
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,000
Pal, the get up is stunning.

1874
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,800
Give that to him.

1875
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:54,760
You are looking too good

1876
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,400
Poorna,

1877
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,760
doesn't he look like a bank employee in that dress?
Yes, Yes!

1878
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:01,500
Hey pal, if you trim the b ear a little,

1879
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,520
you'll look much better.

1880
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,920
Can I see Lara, please!

1881
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,380
Greetings, sir!

1882
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:07,340
Please sit.

1883
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:08,980
Tell me.

1884
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:10,500
My name is Thatha Rao.

1885
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,640
I have 10 crores worth property in Benz Circle.

1886
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,540
Some big wigs have eye on it.

1887
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,640
I need your help in that settlement.

1888
01:31:18,860 --> 01:31:21,860
We can only live if you help us.

1889
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:25,620
Sorry!

1890
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:27,700
I've joined a job.

1891
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:29,440
Please don't mind.

1892
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:33,900
You are my only hope.

1893
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:35,420
If you change your mind,

1894
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:37,220
there is my number in that visiting card.

1895
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:38,220
Please call me.

1896
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:39,080
I will take leave, sir!

1897
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:48,500
Go, wait there!

1898
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,840
I am a social worker.

1899
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,280
The supplies they give in ration stores

1900
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:09,660
aren't reaching even half of the people.

1901
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:11,260
So, I came for your help.

1902
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:13,480
If you help me, I will fight for it.

1903
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:21,680
Get up.

1904
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:23,440
Get up man!

1905
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:24,620
Get up man!

1906
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,300
Plan 2: Sekhar

1907
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:29,460
Who Sekhar here?

1908
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:30,420
Who is Sekhar?

1909
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,280
Get up man!

1910
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,900
Sir, I don't know anything sir!

1911
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,680
Sir, Please leave me. I don't know anything.

1912
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,460
Sir, leave me, sir!

1913
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,520
I really don't know sir.

1914
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,020
No... No...

1915
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,900
It's burning!

1916
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,920
It's burning

1917
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,200
Suri,

1918
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:12,500
Next?

1919
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,460
Plan 3: Bhaskar

1920
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,760
Hey, Aren't you Bhaskar?

1921
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,440
Sir, I will tell you sir.

1922
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:19,080
I will confess

1923
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:21,420
I will confess, sir!

1924
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:22,220
Get up man!

1925
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,240
But, they've arrested your nephew too, haven't they?

1926
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,500
They didn't arrest.

1927
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:34,260
I sent him myself.

1928
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,300
We should cooperate to Law, right!

1929
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,100
I am the nephew of MP.

1930
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:44,340
In the conspiracy of Ration supplies,

1931
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,320
my uncle is involved, sir!

1932
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:53,400
Ashok got to know about it. So, We planned to kill him.

1933
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:55,040
But...

1934
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,320
He escaped sir.

1935
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:01,700
Tell the same in court tomorrow.

1936
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:03,320
You know the consequences if you don't.

1937
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:07,320
Hey... get up... move.

1938
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,800
What? Came to do your signature?

1939
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:14,460
Do it, and go!

1940
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:21,760
Sir

1941
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:23,880
He missed all these treatment, didn't he?

1942
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:24,480
Yes, sir!

1943
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,320
Got spared in a fraction.

1944
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:29,800
Looks like, he's changed a little, sir!

1945
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,280
The girl touched right, sir! Anyone will change.

1946
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:38,180
These women are truly great, sir!

1947
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,800
If you continue this for another 4 months,

1948
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,880
I will close down the rowdy sheet on your name.

1949
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:48,860
Go

1950
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:57,500
Why did you give him 4 months, sir?

1951
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,360
He already looks changed.

1952
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,700
It's not as easy to become a goon...

1953
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:04,140
to become a human

1954
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,320
Why not, sir?

1955
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:05,980
Hey!

1956
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:08,660
That 7th house house in Becent road, 4th street;

1957
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,020
I told you million times.

1958
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:11,500
Did you stop going there?
sir...

1959
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:12,740
This is same scenario.

1960
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,280
Few habits are not easy to get rid of

1961
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,080
His actually problem started now!

1962
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:32,540
Hello!

1963
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:34,260

1964
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:35,040
Lara!

1965
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,520
How are you? Are you alright?

1966
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,680
The cops are tracing my phone.

1967
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:42,040
Inform Poorna that am alright.

1968
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:44,320
Ok. You take care.

1969
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,020

1970
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:54,060
Sir, the phone is trapped sir!

1972
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,480
You are amazing, boss!

1973
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,700
Finished your target just within 15 days.

1974
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:26,900
Nothing so great, boss! Used some known contacts.

1975
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:32,360
Is Manager available?

1976
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:33,540
Sir is inside.

1977
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,120
Greetings, sir! Please come. sit.

1978
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:43,800
How are you?

1979
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:47,080
Your account is one of our top ten accounts.

1980
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,240
How can I help you?

1981
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:49,700
What is he doing here?

1982
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:50,400
Who?

1983
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,960
That pale green shirt.

1984
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,180
Him? His name is Pavan Kumar, sir!

1985
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:58,940
He joined 15 days ago. A very good employee

1986
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,400
Do you know him before sir?

1987
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,140
His original name is Pavan Kumar.

1988
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,920
But people call him Lara.

1989
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:08,340
How did you take him in? He is a huge rowdy sheeter.

1990
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,600
Rowdy sheeter?

1991
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,480
Look, this This scar is given by him.

1992
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:15,140
Sir, I wasn't aware of it, sir! I am transferred here recently

1993
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:17,680
I can't main an account in place with goons like this

1994
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:18,700
I'll take leave.

1995
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:26,080
I just got to learn about you.

1996
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,380
Some of our big accounts are getting closed coz of you

1997
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:31,520
I am answerable to my superiors.

1998
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,960
knowingly I can't let you work here.

1999
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,340
Please try to understand.

2000
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:38,120
Don't worry, pal! If isn't this, you'll get another job.

2001
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,420
We are not fit for these jobs.

2002
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:42,460
Wherever we go, some one or the other will spoil it.

2003
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,720
Our old work was apt for us.

2004
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:46,220
Hey, shut up!

2005
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,360
Pal, we'll find some way.

2006
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,640
Yes, Poorna.

2007
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,474
Dear...

2008
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,820
Mom! When did you come?

2009
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:03,820

2010
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,460
I heard a good news as soon as I came.

2011
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:07,580
Good new?

2012
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,160

01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:14,380
Tell me, Poorna.

2015
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,260
Do you want a girl? or a boy?

2016
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:22,460
Is it true?

2017
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:24,480
Yes.

2018
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:27,580
I am coming

2019
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:32,460
Hey pal! You are going to be an uncle now!

2020
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,160
Hey, congrats, pal!

2021
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:36,300
Guys, our friend is becoming a father!

2022
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:39,640
Congrats, buddy!

2023
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:40,360
Move, man!

2024
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,300
Hey buddy, don't stay here anymore.

2025
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:45,820
Take Poorna and move to Hyderabad.

2026
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:47,640
Hey, stop man!

2027
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:50,660
That Siren is scared of that ACP.

2028
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:52,180
He isn't attacking on us now.

2029
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:55,360
If we step out of the city, It'll be out of ACP's margins.

2030
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,100
He will definitely try to plan on us.

2031
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,540
So, it's good for you to stay here for a while.

2032
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:03,280
Hey buddy, I been trying to call you.

2033
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,200
Your phone is engaged!

2034
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,380
Real Estate Bharani called me for your number.

2035
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:07,700
He wants to meet you once.

2036
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:08,860
Bharani?

2037
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:12,220
Hey hey hey... Lara brother! You are amazing brother!

2038
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,700
I heard you've shaken that ACP

2039
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:15,940
You are amazing, brother!

2040
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,300
Brother, you wanted to talk to me?

2041
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:21,220
Brother, You know our corporator Balaraju, don't you?

2042
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:22,980
That son of a bag,

2043
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:26,060
entered my site and challenged me,

2044
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:27,520
You says he'll occupy it.

2045
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:30,080
Brother, every time he stood for elections

2046
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:33,460
the money he spent on votes to win is mine.

2047
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:37,240
Today he is using the same power to occupy my site.

2048
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,580
His arrogance came with the power, right!

2049
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:41,300
I want that power.

2050
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:43,200
If you all support me brother...

2051
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,440
I will win brother.

2052
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:48,360
Brother, we've stopped all these fights.

2053
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:49,380
We are doing it now.

2054
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,620
What fights, brother?

2055
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,100
Who wants to fight?

2056
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:53,520
I don't want you to fight.

2057
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,680
I want you to do campaign on behalf of me.

2058
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:57,040
'To our Bharani brother...'

2059
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,060
'give your valuable vote and'

2060
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:00,960
'make him win with a great success'

2061
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,960
I need you to do my campaign, brother!

2062
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,080
What do you say, brother?

2063
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:08,820
Alright, brother.

2064
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:09,860
Brother
(kisses)

2065
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:11,020
I love you brother!

2066
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:12,520
Watch now, I'll play with him.

2067
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:14,940
Hey, Balaraju... See now!

2068
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:43,700
Long live, Bharani!

2069
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:47,840
A while ago, in a small incident...

2070
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,320
we said things to each other.

2071
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:51,420
Keeping it in mind, It isn't fair to do it, brother!

2072
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:52,980
What happened to you both? You seem fine so far.

2073
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,480
I am alright, brother!

2074
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:56,880
For him to become a corporator...

2075
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,840
I've spilled money and liquor to support him.

2076
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,400
Now he is blocking up my business

2077
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:03,180
Isn't it the arrogance of Power?

2078
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:04,020
Look...
Sit

2079
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:06,500
The votes I bought for him.. I will buy them for myself

2080
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:08,900
Then Business and Power both will be with me.

2081
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,360
I'll see what can he do?

2082
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:11,620
You tell me the justice.

2083
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:13,040
Matter of a very small land, brother.

2084
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,720
I didn't think he'll make such drama for it.

2085
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,980
You want politics or business?

2086
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:21,360
Politics is about...

2087
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,760
creating groups out of people to live.

2088
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:26,380
Nut business is about...

2089
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,440
Picking people out of groups to live.

2090
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,980
You were talking about some justice...

2091
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:33,660
To live with honesty,

2092
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:35,820
these aren't ancient Ramayana & Bharata days, Bharani

2093
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,760
They've turned into stories now.

2094
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:42,740
People used to vote if your character was good.

2095
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:46,260
Now, they are voting for someone who's got money.

2096
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:48,400
To become a Leader...

2097
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,760
it's not enough to be with people...

2098
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,800
it's important to be on good terms with rich ones.

2099
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,280
Then we end up creating a new leader everyday like this.

2100
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,900
If we keep fighting, the third one will benefit.

2101
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:59,420
Brother, forgive me!

2102
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:01,760
You aren't understanding one thing.

2103
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:04,400
That ACP is very angry with Lara.

2104
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:06,220
If you support him,

2105
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,960
that ACP will target you now.

2106
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:09,640
He is saying Sorry...

2107
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:11,080
Forgive him for now.

2108
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:11,960
Please, brother!

2109
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,020
If he wins, he'll get you all the municipal contracts

2110
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:15,020
Make him say that

2111
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:16,300
Sure, brother!

2112
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:17,600
Now what about Lara?

2113
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,920
Leave his matter to me.

2114
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:23,740
Hey buddy!

2115
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:25,740
Bharani have joined hands with that MLA.

2116
01:42:25,740 --> 01:42:27,820
He is opening their office tomorrow!

2117
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:28,900
what do you mean joined with MLA?

2118
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:29,960
huh?

2119
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:32,360
What the hell do you mean joined with MLA?

2120
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,920
We went to every house to make that Bharani win.

2121
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,620
This is how they treat the weak

2122
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:37,640
If you were the old Lara...

2123
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,920
No. Don't make a scene.

2124
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:41,860
No one make any nuisance.

2125
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:44,760
buddy, not now. We'll take care of him later.

2126
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,160
we'll see it later.

2127
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:49,760
I am going there to find out when to submit the nominations.

2128
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:51,460
Yes! for our Balaju.

2129
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:54,440
The deal is to make him corporator and he'll get us works

2130
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:55,920
Brother, Lara is here.

2131
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,920
Brother... Come in. It is for you.

2132
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,120
I been waiting for you.

2133
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:03,180
come come.

2134
01:43:03,180 --> 01:43:04,740
Let's go meet the MLA

2135
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:18,060
Move from there and I will kill you!

2136
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:21,260
Sir, I just got saved in a hairline distance sir!

2137
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:22,600
I would've died today, sir!

2138
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,680
You should've died, good for all.
Sir!

2139
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:26,980
I beg you. Please do something, sir!

2140
01:43:26,980 --> 01:43:27,940
He will kill me sir..

2141
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:28,980
Fine! write down a complaint.

2142
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,680
Oh no! I won't write against him.

2143
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:32,920
He will kill me.

2144
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:34,700
Please do something, sir!

2145
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:35,580
Fine, get out.

2146
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,080
Oh god, no! I won't step out, sir.

2147
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,420
You please do something, sir! He will kill me.

2148
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:41,220
It doesn't work like that.

2149
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:43,220
You either write a complaint or get out.

2150
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:44,560
You can't stay here. It's against rules.

2151
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:48,680
Sir, tell me what to do to stay here. I will do it

2152
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,560
I am safe as long as am here, sir.

2153
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:51,660
There are bathrooms to clean.

2154
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:52,440
Bathrooms?

2155
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,500
I will clean them, sir!

2156
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,680
Greetings, sir!

2157
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,060
wohoo

2158
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:57,980
Greetings, sir!

2159
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:05,360
He won't complain sir.

2160
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,120
Because, Elections are approaching.

2161
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:08,980
If he complains, the Lara get's more popular

2162
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:10,020
and they will lose votes.

2163
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:12,520
So, they'll consult that MLA and put up some pity case.

2164
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,580
Looks like his first strike, sir!

2165
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:16,460
He looks scared.

2166
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,140
I will take leave, sir

2167
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:20,620
Want to talk to your MLA?

2168
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:21,260
Yes, sir!

2169
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:26,720
Greetings, mother!

2170
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:30,280
Please sit.

2171
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:32,540
Sit.

2172
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:36,860
Look...

2173
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:39,460
I gave your boy a chance to get over his temper

2174
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:40,360
Sir, one minute.

2175
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:42,780
Our sir said he gave a chance to your boy.

2176
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:43,960
That's his humanity.

2177
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:46,600
In real, what he gave was Life.

2178
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:50,780
You think you saved Lara from us that day.

2179
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,600
Though he knows Lara was in bathroom...

2180
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:54,760
our sir left him and walked away!

2181
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:57,800
But, your guy is involving you in cases too.

2182
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,160
He didn't listen to me back then.

2183
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:02,420
Now I won't listen.

2184
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,680
For his behavior,

2185
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:05,520
how do I answer others' mothers like you?

2186
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:07,560
See, you bring a human to life.

2187
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,540
We bring goodness to life.

2188
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:12,660
To bring Goodness to life, it's unavoidable for evil to die.

2189
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:15,600
Mother,

2190
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,220
Anything can happen to your man bacause of us

2191
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:19,280
If that happens,

2192
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:21,740
please don't curse us.

2193
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:27,860
Greetings, sir!

2194
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:30,580
I managed a lot to get you the bail.

2195
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:31,800
You are lucky.

2196
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:34,080
They filed a case saying, you've verbally threatened them.

2197
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,440
But, that ACP won't leave you.

2198
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:37,960
Be careful with him.

2199
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:40,500
Veeradas, Maddi Kesavulu, Patamatalanka Suri,

2200
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,240
they all belong to Veerabhadram.

2201
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:45,300
Karri Srinu, Bali, Mastan Vali,

2202
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:47,080
Edamakanti Koti, Thatichettu Giri

2203
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:48,900
These all are on behalf of Ex MLA Masthan.

2204
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:52,240
The one who is too problematic in them is Lara, sir.

2205
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:54,280
First arrest him under PD Act.

2206
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:56,160
We'll think about him after elections.

2207
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:56,660
Ok Sir.

2208
01:45:56,660 --> 01:45:59,000
Doctor said everything is normal. Don't need to worry.

2209
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:00,680
She said eat in time,

2210
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:02,080
asked you to take good rest,

2211
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,580
what else she said?
Lara...

2212
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:16,220
Ch. Poorna!

2213
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:24,380
Please come back on 11th next month.

2214
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,320
Excuse me!
Tell me, sir!

2215
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:30,300
Our Bhavana...

2216
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,860
Ready, sir! Take this.

2217
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,980
Greetings, Brother!

2218
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,240
I am Lara, Brother!

2219
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:40,640
Lara!

2220
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,040
You are here..

2221
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,040
Wife, brother... she's pregnant

2222
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,440
for check up...

2223
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:53,640
ACP has his eyes on you!

2224
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:55,500
be careful.

2225
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,440
Thats's ok, brother! It is all..

2226
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:58,880
Brother-in-law, shall we go?

2227
01:46:59,160 --> 01:46:59,660
yes

2228
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:01,600
ok.

2229
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:04,440
Let's go.

2230
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:09,940
We arresting you under PD act.

2231
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,480
Leave him, dear!

2232
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:14,420
Let's go!

2233
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:15,900
Take him

2234
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:23,600
Greetings, sir!

2235
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:25,180
Greetings, brother!

2236
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,480
I guessed ACP will arrest you first in Vijayawada.

2237
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,660
That's exactly what happened.

2238
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:32,020
Everyone is scared of ACP.

2239
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:33,780
But, you are playing him well, brother!

2240
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:35,060
You are great, brother!

2241
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:36,760
Greeting Sadhu brother!
Greetings.

2242
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:38,720
What? your remand isn't done yet?

2243
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:40,180
No. there are 2 more months.

2244
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:42,180
Isn't the one who killed your brother is here too?

2245
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:42,820
Yes, he is here.

2246
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:44,780
Careful brother, he might plan on you too!

2247
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,800
When your target is superior,

2248
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:49,840
your way should be superior too!

2249
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:51,220
Gandhi said that.

2250
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:54,760
ACP who is sincere enough to arrest the sitting MP,

2251
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:57,220
Lara couldn't trust him in right time.

2252
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,160
That's why he is

2253
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:00,320
away from his wife, when is supposed to be closer

2254
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:03,620
and close to his enemies, when he is supposed to be away.

2255
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:05,340
He brought it on to him.

2256
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:08,320
Hey, the one's under PD act are releasing tomorrow!

2257
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,620
Where is that Sadhu Bhai?

2258
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:10,740
He'll be around, go check.

2259
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,200
Oh no! That Shiva is outside too.

2260
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:14,200
Sadhu...

2261
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:14,840
(Spits)

2262
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:37,380
You've killed my brother..

2263
01:49:21,780 --> 01:49:22,580
Brother...

2264
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,480
I killed your murderer, brother!

2265
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:25,900
I killed him.

2266
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:27,820
He's lying as a dead body, see!

2267
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:29,880
I killed him, brother!

2268
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:31,680
I killed your murdered.

2269
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,220
Now I don't care about myself.

2270
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:39,500
I didn't imagine Sadhu will kill him like this.

2271
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,820
The one who kills won't give a warning, brother!

2272
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,880
They'll come peacefully like Sadhu.

2273
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:46,440
He'll burst out like a tsunami when the time is right.

2274
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:49,340
Whatever it is, human's should always stay from the enemies.

2275
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:51,900
If not, he'll die like this.

2276
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:53,840
He's not even scared, that it's jail, brother!

2277
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:57,300
An enemy won't see the Jail, Courts and Police.

2278
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:59,420
Only the enemy's life is visible.

2279
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:15,080
If you change your mind...

2280
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,680
to the number in the visiting card,

2281
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:19,320
please call me!

2282
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:26,080
What happened?

2283
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:27,540
10 years ago,

2284
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:30,620
I bought a land I city with 10 crores.

2285
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,500
2 years ago,

2286
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,380
to a financier named Venkat Rao,

2287
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:36,740
I kept the land in mortgage and took 2 crores.

2288
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:39,060
Now the land value is

2289
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:40,480
10 crores.

2290
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,260
When I said I want to clear the debt,

2291
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:44,260
He said leave that site.

2292
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:46,180
Who all are involved in this?

2293
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:47,620
MLA Veerabhadram,

2294
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:50,300
Mani's brother-in-laws Chandu, Durga Prasad.

2295
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:51,820
Being scared of them,

2296
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:54,900
no one is daring to take my side in the city

2297
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,200
If ACP is transferred, or

2298
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:08,940
if Lara isn't stopped,

2299
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:10,600
he looks weaker in front of public.

2300
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:13,220
That Lara has got an eye on ne.

2301
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:16,960
If we take a back step, he'll become a hero

2302
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:20,900
Lara shouldn't settle that land matter

2303
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,960
You should deal this issue

2304
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,940
Anything can happen in Lara's matter.

2305
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:25,900
Mani,

2306
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:27,680
I don't have courage to kill, but...

2307
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,860
I have capacity to save the one who can kill

2308
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,160
Mani, I need your help.

2309
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:35,640
I will not let anything happen to you.

2310
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:38,300
Sir, I would've died if you didn't save me then.

2311
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:41,760
At least if I stop Lara, that can be my pay back to you

2312
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:42,920
Thank you, Mani!

2313
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:44,020
Thank you!

2314
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:46,680
The gust of a human is an addiction

2315
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:48,220
If gust is our slave,

2316
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:49,520
it'll tell us how to live.

2317
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:51,300
If we became slave to gust,

2318
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:53,160
It'll tell us how long we would live.

2319
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:54,240
Like these!

2320
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:56,160
Think again, brother-in-law!

2321
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,920
It's not easy to convince Lara with words.

2322
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:00,120
He is still coming after knowing it's you.

2323
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:02,480
ThathaRao must have given him a bait of money

2324
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:07,020
Greeting, brother! All good?

2325
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:17,620
Our Durga said something.

2326
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:21,320
If you guys discuss, it might lead to a fight

2327
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:22,960
That's why I came along.

2328
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:26,300
There is justice in Thatharao's side.

2329
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:27,540
that's why,

2330
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:29,820
I came to ask you to return his property.

2331
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:30,500
what?

2332
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:31,800
justice?

2333
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:33,600
You came to say this?

2334
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:35,600
What's your share in this?

2335
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:42,060
Aren't I talking here?

2336
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,680
Don't mind him, Lara.

2337
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:49,260
It's my responsibility to make sure he gets justice.

2338
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:51,180
You go.

2339
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,720
I will take care

2340
01:52:58,640 --> 01:52:59,880
Did you see, brother?

2341
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,460
Look at his face.

2342
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:03,400
That's why...

2343
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,820
Do that justice in front of me. I will stay here

2344
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:09,380
What? Don't do know how to do settlements?

2345
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:10,320
Chandu!

2346
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:18,540
I know they'll talk this way, brother.

2347
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:19,537
That's why...

2348
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:22,360
only because I respect you, I came here.

2349
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:23,490
What if I don't talk?

2350
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:23,980
Chandu!

2351
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:30,040
Lara, This is why I am involved.

2352
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:31,820
If there is anything,

2353
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:33,460
I will take care.

2354
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,140
You go!

2355
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:39,280
Brother...

2356
01:53:39,940 --> 01:53:42,240
Don't take me otherwise.

2357
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,020
Do you have a share in this?

2358
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:46,580
Hey!

2359
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:48,540
If my brother-in-law has got a share...

2360
01:53:48,540 --> 01:53:49,100
Chandu!

2361
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:57,060
Brother...

2362
01:53:58,240 --> 01:53:59,660
As you suspected,

2363
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,600
I don't have anything with this.

2364
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:05,560
I promised MLA that I'll keep you away from this matter

2365
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:06,800
I am telling you again.

2366
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:11,360
I will ensure Thatharao gets his justice.

2367
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:14,760
Leave this matter right here.

2368
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:18,180
No way, brother.

2369
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:19,480
Didn't I tell you, brother-in-law?

2370
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:22,740
He came well-planned to snatch this property.

2371
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:23,520
Is it?

2372
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:24,940
Really?

2373
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:29,920
I know your sketch too!

2374
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:32,720
I know you both are MLA's benamis

2375
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:35,920
I know you want to occupy the land

2376
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:38,380
and build some shopping complex...

2377
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:40,660
I know you three will share it too.

2378
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,120
What do you call this?

2379
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:45,120
What do you call this?

2380
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,520
Brother, there is something called justice.

2381
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,700
Lara,

2382
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:53,320
It is Police and courts job to do justice.

2383
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,920
it is injustice for us to do it.

2384
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:59,200
We don't have any right to talk about justice.

2385
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,580
It's all about strengths.

2386
01:55:01,580 --> 01:55:02,840
If you are strong enough,

2387
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:04,380
you'll live.

2388
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,840
If I am strong enough,

2389
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:06,900
I'll live.

2390
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:07,860
That's all!

2391
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:11,600
Let's keep living aside,

2392
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:14,640
if police and courts are doing their job,

2393
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:17,480
you and me might not talk like this, brother.

2394
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:18,740
No more words, Lara!

2395
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,680
Tell me what do you want.

2396
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:22,540
I will give you

2397
01:55:28,780 --> 01:55:30,200
You tell me what do you want, brother!

2398
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,440
I will give you.

2399
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:33,660
Hey,

2400
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:35,280
what will you give us?

2401
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:36,000
Chandu!

2402
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:37,360
Lara,

2403
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:39,420
This is not the way.

2404
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,080
You came after knowing it's me.

2405
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
It's not us who should step back.

2406
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:47,500
You.

2407
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,940
He came to me saying it's his property.

2408
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:53,040
I came to help him get his property back.

2409
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:55,700
That's all. Not because you.

2410
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,620
Whoever came in your plce,

2411
01:55:58,620 --> 01:55:59,760
I wouldn't step back.

2412
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:06,560
You said it right

2413
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:09,440
He won't listen

2414
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:11,640
My guy said it right too, brother!

2415
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:14,740
Not bad using your brother-in-laws to cover your settlements.

2416
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:17,120
Lara...

2417
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:19,880
This will be the last time to talk to you.

2418
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:21,900
Are you stepping aside?

2419
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:23,040
or not?

2420
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,800
Why are you still talking to him, brother-in-law?

2421
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:25,340
Hey!

2422
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:27,460
I give you 2 mins to get lost.

2423
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:29,960
Hey!

2424
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:31,940
You gave me 2 minutes.

2425
01:56:31,940 --> 01:56:33,620
I am giving you 2 days.

2426
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:36,100
Handover the property papers and I will let you live.

2427
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:39,040
Let's see who will live.

2428
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:56,760
Hey,

2429
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:58,880
listen you me, man!

2430
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:01,720
It's a big mistake to fight with that Mani

2431
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:02,980
No, pal.

2432
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:05,980
At any cost, this settlement shouldn't stop.

2433
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:07,980
You will get yourself in to trouble, man

2434
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,720
They will kill you.

2435
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:11,480
I don't have another way!

2436
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:20,300
I've done settlements for many people.

2437
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:23,880
They won't let me live, anyway

2438
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:25,720
but,

2439
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:29,280
I don't even know when will I be dead

2440
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:33,620
If something happened to me,

2441
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:37,500
Poorna will be clueless

2442
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:42,380
When I was nothing to her,

2443
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:46,960
she saved me, risking her own life.

2444
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:51,020
Before I die...

2445
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:54,100
I need to do something for her

2446
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,400
At any cost, this settlement shouldn't stop.

2447
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:16,860
He gave us 2 days time

2448
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:19,080
and we,

2449
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:21,320
give him 1 day

2450
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:26,220
That's all

2451
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:59,320
Brother, your hand is cut.

2452
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:18,440
I was going on a bike, sir.

2453
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:20,780
An auto came very fast from behind and hit me.

2454
01:59:20,840 --> 01:59:22,440
I fell down with the bike

2455
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:25,320
I got up and shouted on him

2456
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:26,720
He started fighting with me

2457
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:28,300
meanwhile,

2458
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:30,040
Another guy got down from Auto with a knife

2459
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,340
and cut my hand

2460
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:33,260
That's all I remember, sir!

2461
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:35,320
Is that all?

2462
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,280
Is that all?

2463
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:40,800
Mani,

2464
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:45,680
I will write the same

2465
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:50,320
Elevated Streetfights!

2466
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:53,420
(A gang war has started between Rowdy sheeters Mani and Lara)

2467
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:55,880
(I got to know there is some political involvement in this)

2468
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:59,380
(If that is true, many fights and murders might happen.)

2469
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:02,620
(ACP Rajendra, who's been sincerely controlling rowdyism in the city...)

2470
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:04,800
(...how is he going to act on this)

2471
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,300
(every one is eagerly waiting for that)

2472
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:10,440
Even if we arrest them, I don't think these fights will stop, sir

2473
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:14,320
Exactly!

2474
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,980
That's why don't arrest either of them two

2475
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:20,840
Whoever you find, encounter thewm

2476
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:23,800
Then rest of them, will stay in control.

2477
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:29,820
When people stop trusting the real constitution,

2478
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:32,940
We need to act upon the constitution that they know

2479
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,500
Or the common public will suffer

2480
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:36,160
Ok, sir!

2481
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:38,580
Buddy,

2482
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:39,740
Where did you go?

2483
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:41,980
Poorna didn't eat anything since the last 2 days

2484
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:43,580
Are you planning to kill that girl?

2485
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:46,180
It's not that. Police are trapping my phone.

2486
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:47,040
So, I've switched it off

2487
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:48,440
Give it to Poorna first.

2488
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:49,840
Hello!

2489
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:52,160
Lara, are you alright?

2490
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:54,200
I am alright. Don't get scared.

2491
02:00:54,220 --> 02:00:55,860
Take me with you

2492
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:57,880
Or, I will die right here

2493
02:00:57,920 --> 02:00:58,640
Poorna...

2494
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:01,740
Day after is Holi festival.

2495
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:03,320
I will come on that day

2496
02:01:03,580 --> 02:01:04,460
No, you won't

2497
02:01:04,460 --> 02:01:06,460
Ravi brother told me everything.

2498
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:07,400
What did he tell you?

2499
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:09,140
You are collecting money for me

2500
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:11,700
If you aren't there, I don't want that money

2501
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:12,960
Take me along with you

2502
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:15,420
Poorna, don't cry!

2503
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:18,040
Please don't cry, Poorna.

2504
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:21,660
I will definitely come on Holi festival.

2505
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:23,980
I will come for you

2506
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:25,920
Ok?

2507
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:39,760
Tell me, Lara.

2508
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,560
You know the situation, brother.

2509
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:52,080
in this time, if I have some politician's support...

2510
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:56,540
It's very difficult to get political support in this time.

2511
02:01:57,100 --> 02:01:57,800
But Lara,

2512
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,260
Politicians may help you get out of the case.

2513
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:02,200
But they can't save you from death.

2514
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:04,760
Did you see Sadhu in jail?

2515
02:02:04,980 --> 02:02:06,200
Revenge looks like that

2516
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:07,440
Maddelacheruvu Suri,

2517
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:08,340
Moddu Srinu

2518
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:09,260
Paritala Ravi.

2519
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:10,800
Did any politician save these?

2520
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,360
Because, they are not politics but revenges.

2521
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:15,740
If these politicians get some public pressure,

2522
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:17,800
They will say I don't know any Lara.

2523
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:21,100
Rowdy is all about scring people

2524
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:22,720
and dying with fear

2525
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:26,980
don't take me otherwise, brother!

2526
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:30,720
The day you fought with Siren, I knew this day will come

2527
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:33,060
You wouldn't listen to me even if I say something.

2528
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:34,740
I can't do anything now

2529
02:02:34,740 --> 02:02:36,240
Not just you, brother.

2530
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:38,440
Everyone like us gets a day like this

2531
02:02:38,540 --> 02:02:41,900
They build these idols to tell us we are doing wrong

2532
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:45,960
We still don't change. Mani is just like you. No one can scare him.

2533
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:47,860
He is just not scared of police

2534
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:50,820
That's why that MLA strategically sent him to you

2535
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:52,600
Look, brother.

2536
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:55,160
Listen to me and compromise with Mani directly.

2537
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:57,900
Don't trust any one.

2538
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:58,980
Not even me.

2539
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:07,940
Hey!

2540
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:11,060
If you find Lara, kill him

2541
02:03:16,340 --> 02:03:17,620
If you don't find him...

2542
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:20,380
you all split into four teams.

2543
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:23,120
In each team...

2544
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:26,000
keep one who can identify him

2545
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:29,480
SI and Balaraju..

2546
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,920
will keep giving you information from here

2547
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:37,240
Kesava will go towards Amaravathi.

2548
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:39,380
Tella Sai will go towards Guntur.

2549
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:41,240
Siren Ramesh

2550
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:42,980
stays in the city outskirts.

2551
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:44,100
and will come wherever you need him

2552
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:46,820
Chandu will gather Lara's information

2553
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:49,560
from his family and Relatives.

2554
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:54,820
Remember one thing!

2555
02:03:56,680 --> 02:03:58,660
We will only meet again...

2556
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:02,000
Only after that Lara is dead.

2557
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:07,760
It's true that Lara asked me for support, sir

2558
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:09,920
Mani asked me for support too

2559
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:11,620
But, I didn't support anyone

2560
02:07:12,220 --> 02:07:14,260
I am staying away from all these activities.

2561
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:15,840
Even you know that.

2562
02:07:16,940 --> 02:07:19,900
Sir.. It's true I went to seek Lara's help

2563
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:22,400
But I don't have any communication with him, sir.

2564
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:25,260
Whatever information you get about Lara,

2565
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:26,440
you should inform me

2566
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:29,540
Hello, Lara!

2567
02:07:36,980 --> 02:07:39,120
Sir, Lara's phone is getting trapped.

2568
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:42,280
Sir, that is Lara and this is Ravi.

2569
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,660
He is talking from our office sir.

2570
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:46,800
Sir, Lara is on the line.

2571
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:47,800
He wants to talk to you.

2572
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:49,060
Please talk to him once, sir!

2573
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:50,580
Hello!

2574
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:52,660
I made a mistake, sir!

2575
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:53,700
Why are you telling me that?

2576
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:55,900
Hello!

2577
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:57,480
Hello!

2578
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:59,800
I am not worthy of your help.

2579
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:03,500
But I thought only you can help me now.

2580
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:06,000
That's why I called you.

2581
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:07,180
What can I do?

2582
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:10,000
You are carrying a weapon, saying I can't do anything

2583
02:08:10,780 --> 02:08:12,920
It's you who have to build a weapon-free society

2584
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:16,180
When those weapons are on our necks...

2585
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:18,640
Instead of you,

2586
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:20,560
we are thinking of our lives sir!

2587
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:25,360
Before me, there are many that doesn't fear police.

2588
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:28,080
I am unlucky like them,

2589
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:31,440
couldn't meet a sincere office like you in right time,

2590
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:34,220
I became one of them.

2591
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,100
Even you know that, sir!

2592
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:38,980
That's why

2593
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:41,040
you let me go without encountering.

2594
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:43,520
Though you know I was inside the bathroom,

2595
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:47,800
you know it sir.

2596
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:50,860
If every cop was like you,

2597
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:52,860
I wouldn't be like this today, sir!

2598
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:55,900
When I was a kid, my dad used to scare me, sir!

2599
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:58,000
That's why I never missed school for a day!

2600
02:08:58,580 --> 02:09:00,460
The teachers used to scare me too, sir!

2601
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:03,140
That's why I studied well and got a state rank.

2602
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:05,180
But, your police sir...

2603
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:08,400
couldn't scare me.

2604
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:12,920
Now my to-be-born kid reminded me what fear feels like

2605
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:22,000
I was a good son to my dad.

2606
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:25,400
I was a good student to my teachers.

2607
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:29,380
I was a good husband to my wife.

2608
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:32,940
But your police didn't let me be a good man in the society

2609
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:40,740
I couldn't see the difference between good and bad

2610
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:42,700
That's why,

2611
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:45,280
I couldn't believe you too

2612
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:48,200
Now I am standing at the edge of death

2613
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:50,980
Knowing I will be dead,

2614
02:09:51,180 --> 02:09:54,460
this is the mistake to keep at least my wife alive.

2615
02:09:55,420 --> 02:09:57,740
I felt like telling all this to you.

2616
02:09:58,520 --> 02:09:59,820
So I called you.

2617
02:10:00,340 --> 02:10:02,180
I am not worthy of your help

2618
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:05,040
But I don't have any other way.

2619
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:10,500
Please help me for this once.

2620
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:13,160
I want to save my wife and kid

2621
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:13,800
Fine.

2622
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:15,120
Come and meet me in the station tomorrow.

2623
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:17,060
Thank you sir.

2624
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:18,220
I will come, sir

2625
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:20,880
But, not now, sir.

2626
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:23,920
Mani's men are searching for me to kill

2627
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:26,900
Some of your cops are his men too

2628
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:29,840
They'll kill me in the lock-up too

2629
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:31,860
If you send me to jail,

2630
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:33,760
there is no guarantee to life there too!

2631
02:10:34,920 --> 02:10:36,580
Ok, what do you want me to do now?

2632
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:37,420
Sir,

2633
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:39,220
please convince Mani and

2634
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:41,740
stop him just for 4 days.

2635
02:10:44,240 --> 02:10:45,920
My kid will be born by then

2636
02:10:46,600 --> 02:10:48,140
Then I will take my kid,

2637
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:49,760
place it near his feet and

2638
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:51,180
request him to let me live.

2639
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:54,100
He wants me to die or live,

2640
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:55,220
It's up to him.

2641
02:10:57,640 --> 02:11:00,280
Please keep me alive until then, sir!

2642
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:01,380
Ok!

2643
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:02,900
I will try

2644
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:04,320
Thank you, sir!

2645
02:11:12,660 --> 02:11:13,360
Mani,

2646
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:15,260
ACP will definitely call you.

2647
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:28,360
Brother,

2648
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:28,940
Mani!

2649
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:30,360
It's me, PVR!

2650
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:32,920
Calling you from ACP sir's office.

2651
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:36,300
Your daughter is with us.

2652
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:38,800
No one can escape from police.

2653
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,720
You are in hide knowing that, aren't you?

2654
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:42,940
Don't get scared.

2655
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:46,320
Just to take your personal contact,

2656
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:47,620
we've called your daughter here.

2657
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:49,640
ACP sir is calling you here

2658
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:52,760
I am...

2659
02:11:53,140 --> 02:11:53,880
very,

2660
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:55,360
very far away

2661
02:11:55,600 --> 02:11:56,500
I know!

2662
02:11:56,660 --> 02:11:57,480
Tomorrow,

2663
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:01,060
I'll be there by morning.

2664
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:31,420
Mani, you know about me.

2665
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:33,800
You know what I am capable of, too.

2666
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:36,520
I am telling you to avoid that extremes.

2667
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:38,440
Let Lara go.

2668
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:39,200
If I leave him,

2669
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:41,420
If I leave him, will he let me go, sir?

2670
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:43,760
Lara says he'll surrender himself

2671
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:44,400
huh?

2672
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,740
So, I'll surrender myself too, sir!

2673
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:47,720
what do you mean?

2674
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:50,900
Do you want to kill Lara?

2675
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:53,220
You are a great man, sir!

2676
02:12:55,740 --> 02:12:57,020
We are unfortunate

2677
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:58,300
we couldn't change.

2678
02:12:58,300 --> 02:13:01,560
Each time I want to change, I saw death.

2679
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:02,140
This

2680
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:04,560
This is what I've learned from my experience.

2681
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:10,940
We are living filthy lives, that doesn't listen to anyone.

2682
02:13:10,940 --> 02:13:13,800
I can save Lara without discussing with you.

2683
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:17,680
I called you assuming you now know the value of life.

2684
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:20,720
I will make sure Lara won't hurt you.

2685
02:13:21,060 --> 02:13:21,940
Let Lara go!

2686
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:27,680
(laughs)

2687
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:30,500
Will you give me security, sir?

2688
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:34,260
(Laughs)

2689
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:34,920
Sir!

2690
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:40,580
What are we and lives, sir?

2691
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:41,120
huh!

2692
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:44,600
How do I tell you sir?

2693
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:46,700
The day I got into this Rowdyism,

2694
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:50,460
I've learned how to reply with death coz, I can't trust words anymore.

2695
02:13:51,880 --> 02:13:52,920
You are still...

2696
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:55,720
considering us like humans

2697
02:13:57,640 --> 02:13:59,600
I am ashamed of myself to sit in front of you.

2698
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:02,940
We are not humans, sir!

2699
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:04,340
not humans.

2700
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:11,160
Someone...

2701
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:13,900
Someone tried to help me

2702
02:14:15,620 --> 02:14:17,480
Someone save my life.

2703
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:22,460
Now I am the sharp weapon built in his hands sir

2704
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:29,480
Sir, unlike you, you you and you, I can't trust anyone sir!

2705
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:33,060
I don't even have the life force in me, sir!

2706
02:14:33,120 --> 02:14:35,360
I am a grave always looking for deadbodies!

2707
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:43,100
It's not as easy as telling morals, Mani!

2708
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:45,360
Living!

2709
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:47,820
It's not as easy as talking.

2710
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:49,300
Killing!

2711
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:53,000
I am asking you for the last time.

2712
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:56,160
Will you let Lara go or not?

2713
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,760
You won't listen like this

2714
02:15:05,620 --> 02:15:06,500
won't listen

2715
02:15:11,680 --> 02:15:13,600
You made your mind to kill him

2716
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:15,680
Now, I am telling you

2717
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:18,600
You've sent a team to kill him, didn't you?

2718
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:21,680
I will sit right here!

2719
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,360
I am sending my team.

2720
02:15:25,740 --> 02:15:28,220
Let's see if you can kill or I can save.

2721
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:29,540
Shiva!

2722
02:16:24,140 --> 02:16:28,540
Where is the messy knot?

2723
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:35,440
What is it telling you?

2724
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:41,300
Where is the messy knot?

2725
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:47,560
What is it telling you?

2726
02:16:49,620 --> 02:16:52,460
These are the invisible handcuffs

2727
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:55,640
Who will break them?

2728
02:16:55,940 --> 02:16:59,040
The eyes looking like glass balls

2729
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:02,140
what is the difference even if they are open

2730
02:17:02,400 --> 02:17:07,000
Where is the messy knot?

2731
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:13,340
What is it telling you?

2732
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:45,560
We strangle ourselves with our own hands

2733
02:17:45,720 --> 02:17:48,600
we compress the breathe in our hearts

2734
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:58,280
We strangle ourselves with our own hands

2735
02:17:58,300 --> 02:18:01,520
we compress the breathe in our hearts

2736
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:06,980
We welcome the death and assume that is living

2737
02:18:07,980 --> 02:18:13,560
We welcome the death and assume that is living

2738
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:16,900
Every warm blood drop,

2739
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:19,760
a cold fight between life and death

2740
02:18:19,960 --> 02:18:23,380
It won't light any sun-ray

2741
02:18:23,540 --> 02:18:26,920
Every morning is the birth of darkness

2742
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:32,040
Where is the messy knot?

2743
02:18:33,400 --> 02:18:38,120
What is it telling you?

2744
02:19:18,380 --> 02:19:26,100
One can't hear their own cry,

2745
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:29,640
in this echo of silence

2746
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:37,580
One can't hear their own cry, in this echo of silence.

2747
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:43,180
Who is crying and

2748
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:46,540
who will console the other?

2749
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:52,880
Who is crying and who will console the other?

2750
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:55,920
There are many people for name sake.

2751
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:58,800
But loneliness is piling up.

2752
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:02,420
cowardliness spreading in each nerve.

2753
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:05,640
We are the answers to all questions.

2754
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:13,160
Where is the messy knot?

2755
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:19,340
What is it telling you?

2756
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:25,560
Where is the messy knot?

2757
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:31,860
What is it telling you?

2758
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:36,660
These invisible handcuffs

2759
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:39,680
Who will break these now?

2760
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:43,160
The eyes looking like glass balls.

2761
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:46,420
what is the difference even if they are open

2762
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:51,040
Where is the messy knot?

2763
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:57,380
What is it telling you?

2764
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:02,060
When I traced his number last time,

2765
02:21:02,060 --> 02:21:03,880
he was in Mangalagiri

2766
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:08,120
Wherever he went after that

2767
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:10,740
Our people...

2768
02:21:10,740 --> 02:21:12,660
I asked Tella Sai's team to go there.

2769
02:21:14,260 --> 02:21:14,980
that's all

2770
02:21:54,580 --> 02:22:00,560
(Sloka of Goddess Kanakadurga)

2771
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:55,980
Hey!

2772
02:22:58,100 --> 02:22:58,780
Kill him

2773
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:19,300
Brother...

2774
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:21,600
Listen to me once, brother!

2775
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:23,560
I will leave all this, brother!

2776
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:25,460
I will never bother you, brother!

2777
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:26,800
Please, brother!

2778
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:28,560
Please let me go, brother!

2779
02:23:28,700 --> 02:23:29,440
Hey!

2780
02:23:31,100 --> 02:23:33,720
You think I am Ramadas to let you go?

2781
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:35,180
Siren

2782
02:23:35,720 --> 02:23:36,880
Siren

2783
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:38,420
Brother.. Brother...

2784
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:40,460
Take me to Mani brother

2785
02:23:40,460 --> 02:23:41,560
I will talk to him, brother

2786
02:23:41,860 --> 02:23:42,780
(spits)

2787
02:23:43,100 --> 02:23:44,120
Hey,

2788
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:47,100
I won't let you go alive. Mother promise!

2789
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:48,820
I need to go to the hospital, brother!

2790
02:23:49,060 --> 02:23:51,180
My wife is pregnant, brother!

2791
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:55,160
She is giving birth in an hour, brother!

2792
02:23:55,780 --> 02:23:58,100

Hello!

2795
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:07,860
Sir,

2796
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:10,000
Someone is beating the person you showed.

2797
02:24:10,060 --> 02:24:11,540
They might kill him, sir

2798
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:12,240
Where?

2799
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:13,620
It's near Krishna Barrage sir.

2800
02:24:14,420 --> 02:24:14,920
Hey!

2801
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:19,900
Please let me go to the hospital, brother!

2802
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:21,980
I beg you all

2803
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:24,280
Goddess Durga!

2804
02:24:28,700 --> 02:24:31,400
Please save my life for this once!

2805
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:46,080
Brother, please let me go once

2806
02:24:46,860 --> 02:24:49,360
You can kill me after that

2807
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:51,440
Please push one more time

2808
02:24:54,020 --> 02:24:57,160
Let me see my kid once and then kill me

2809
02:24:57,360 --> 02:24:58,580
Please brother

2810
02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:01,800
I beg you. I'll touch your feet

2811
02:26:06,060 --> 02:26:08,100
The cops are coming. The cops

2812
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:11,320
They are coming. let's go

2813
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:13,380
move. let's go

2814
02:27:12,080 --> 02:27:12,820
Careful

2815
02:27:24,060 --> 02:27:25,280
Sit here

2816
02:27:29,660 --> 02:27:30,300
Lara...

2817
02:27:32,140 --> 02:27:32,780
Lara...

2818
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:34,700
Lara...

2819
02:27:40,020 --> 02:27:41,300
You are blessed with a baby boy!

2820
02:28:07,060 --> 02:28:07,980
Look, Mani

2821
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:09,900
You are not goons by birth

2822
02:28:10,460 --> 02:28:11,920
I am not police by birth either

2823
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:14,360
We are all humans first

2824
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:15,980
who are born just like this

2825
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:19,220
Shall we talk like humans for a while?

2826
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:24,340
There is a basic difference between wild animals and us

2827
02:28:26,660 --> 02:28:29,220
We know the difference between the life and death

2828
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:30,460
they don't

2829
02:28:30,460 --> 02:28:32,140
That's why we wrote a constitution for ourselves

2830
02:28:32,140 --> 02:28:35,160
Since the animals don't understand it, we came far from them

2831
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:37,380
Now tell me

2832
02:28:37,780 --> 02:28:39,140
Where do you belong?

2833
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:42,300
You don't have guarantee for your lives here...

2834
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:45,520
Then, how will you take care of someone else?

2835
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:51,360
It became so easy for you to kill each other.

2836
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:55,740
You'll know the value of life when you save one.

2837
02:28:56,700 --> 02:28:59,360
You'll the value of life if you give birth to one.

2838
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:03,800
Carry a life for 9 months and give birth, you'll know it's value

2839
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:09,620
How does it feel to give birth...Ask that mother.

2840
02:29:10,460 --> 02:29:11,900
If she says it's easy,

2841
02:29:13,900 --> 02:29:15,120
Get out and kill each other

2842
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:31,920
To the mothers who are giving birth...

2843
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:34,120
To the police who are saving lives...

2844
02:29:34,600 --> 02:29:35,560
Our film is...

2845
02:29:35,920 --> 02:29:36,720
dedicated!
