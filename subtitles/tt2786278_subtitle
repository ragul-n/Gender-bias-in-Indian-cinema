00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,211

- I don't know!

3
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,588
- What is it?
- Feac...

4
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:51,964
Keep quiet!

5
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,387
Do we have brazen people
in our place to do this?

6
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,599
When I went to supply milk
at Lonappan's place this morning...

7
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,685
I saw Bakery Mathai ducking here...

8
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,480
- Could it be him?
- Not likely!

9
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,445
Ma'am, praise the Lord!

10
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,615
What is that golden covered packet?

11
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,407
Feaces!

12
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,369
Is it pork meat?
Make pickled pig's knuckles!

13
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,913
It would be splendid!

14
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,751
Ma.

15
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,153
Can't you figure out what it is?

16
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,363
Feaces!

17
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:03,244
When did Mathai
pack this and left it there!

18
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:08,916
He even asked ma'am
if it is pork meat?

19
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,543
He told her to make
pig knuckles and consume it!

20
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,255
I would make him eat it!

21
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,841
Get me two teak leaves!

22
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,979
- What is it Chachappa?
- Few fishes Thangamma!

23
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:31,730
It is moray eel!

24
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,280
Would be great for fish gravy!

25
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,828
Is it a backwater catch?

26
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:50,791
No, it is baited from the toilet!

27
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,336
Thresy! ls the stove hot?

28
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,964
It is moray eel!
If we don't heat it up...

29
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,799
...it would become
difficult to peel them!

30
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,467
From where did you
get moray eel?

31
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,303
Chachappan brought it

32
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,596
You prepare for the gravy!

33
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,602
My God!

34
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,827
Mathai! Salvage our family esteem!

35
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,040
Chachappa!

36
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,196
What happened?

37
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,823
Sir! This beggar hurled
faeces in my house!

38
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:08,786
Sir! This fellow gave faeces
to my mom saying it is moray eel!

39
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:16,126
'Police Station'

40
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,422
Stop it!

41
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:28,597
Don't come to my station
with such faecal cases!

42
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,182

43
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,654

144
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,906
Are you going to play
band tomorrow?

145
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,165
Brother!

146
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,709
When I started for the church
did I not wake you up?

147
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,503
Did you sleep again?

148
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,005
After you left,
I felt little feverish...

149
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,423
So I went to bed again!

150
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,509
Jesus! Let me see!

151
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,595
Like cows defecate
this guy gets fever so often!

152
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,974
He needs bum whipping!

153
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,769
If this is repeated
that is sure to happen

154
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:10,937
- It is true mom!
- Is it!

155
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,898
Dad and his angels
gave me coffee and left!

156
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,108
Jesus!

157
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,820
There is no coffee powder
and sugar at home!

158
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,947
Then how could dad
prepare coffee?

159
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,240
Keep quiet, Clara!

160
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,285
The angels would have brought
coffee powder and sugar!

161
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,704
Son! Did dad say anything else?

162
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:28,997
Mom bless me!

163
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,249
I am going to play
the band tomorrow!

164
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,710
Hey! Bless me and go

165
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,503
Tomorrow your brother
is playing the band!

166
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,046
- Are you coming mom?
- Go woman!

167
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,298
Bye!

168
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,971

lam going to play
before a gathering!

170
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,392
In case I tremble,
stay along with me!

171
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,204
Solomon! Is this the attire
for an helper of the church?

172
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:13,583
Pope told me to join
the band today!

173
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,669
An helper's job in church
is not playing the clarinet!

174
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,964
Those who did not take
part in new year prayer...

175
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,591
...need not play in church band!

176
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,009
Please don't talk like that, Father!

177
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,928
I informed everyone that
I would play the band tomorrow!

178
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,267
Don't look at him!

179
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,771
Gee Varghese band expenses
are not borne by the pope

180
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,314
It is borne by the church!

181
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:39,067
Church may bear
the band expenses!

182
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:43,988
But it is me who decide
who should play in the band!

183
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,618
I am a vicar in this parish
for the last 15 years!

184
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:52,789
All these years the church band
has lost everywhere!

185
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,541
I believe Thomas's contention is
do not accept anything...

186
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,126
...until seen by your own eyes!

187
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,337
Why are you creating
an issue Father?

188
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,172
Is it because we asked him to play?

189
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,342
More than this guy
he has all the credentials...

190
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,177
...to play for the church band

191
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:09,222
He is the son of Esthappan master!

192
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,474
A person is not selected for band...
<font color="#00ff00"><font face="Palatino Linotype"><b>Team Jaffa [ExclusivE]</b></font></font>

193
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,601
...based on his dad's name
and his lineage!

194
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:16,396
Have you heard him play?

195
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,649
You may play now!

196
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,113
Let me hear you!

197
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,385
No sound is coming from this!

198
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,971
Has someone packed cloth inside?

199
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,306
Father...!

200
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,809
Come on play man!

201
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:58,062
When you suddenly
asked me to play...

202
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,941
Are you going to play in toilets?

203
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,776
Come on play, man!

204
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:15,997
May man!

205
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:25,214
First learn to ring the bell
and make frankincense

206
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,216
Try to become a sacristan!

207
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:32,054
Remove the shirt
and give it to the pope!

208
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,557
Must be at the church at 5 AM...

209
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,976
...and ring the bell
for the first mass!

210
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,544
Leelamma! Keep this at the Kitchen!

211
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,963
Kamalahasan engineer bought this!

212
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,840
On the other bank
today it is Davi's band!

213
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:08,716
It is impressive

214
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,759
Leelamma!

215
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,261
Is it grilled breast
or duck roast?

216
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,765
Leelamma, you didn't answer me!

217
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,142
Engineer sir! What is that you want?

218
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,770
You take it home
I will answer him!

219
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,021
Kamalahassan Engineer!

220
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,564
This is not meant for today!

221
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,068
For tonight all creatures
living in water and land...

222
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,654
...are cooked and the curries
are swanked on table!

223
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,281
The only one left out
is the cow in the cowshed!

224
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:35,076
Shall I cut the cow's udder
and make pickles for you?

225
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:39,497
- What are you talking?
- How else can I answer him?

226
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,500
Engineer sir! He was just joking!

227
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,252
Come on sir
Climb up sir!

228
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:45,795
I thought...

229
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,049
Matha!

230
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:54,011
That guy Solomon
who is after this girl...

231
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:58,099
...stitched shirts for band
and went upstairs

232
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,433
Will the Father allow him?

233
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,394
Instantly he drove him out

234
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,982
Dad! Don't talk ill of Solomon!

235
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,568
I would splash chilli water on your face!

236
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,243
Who is Solomon for you?

237
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,870
Shall I serve you a cutlet?

238
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,497
Did you not hear me?

239
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,584
Who is Solomon for you?

240
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,461
I am going to marry him
He is my groom

241
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,432
What have you done Mathacha?

242
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,809
Coddle her!
You pampered her and now...

243
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,352
Wash the face!

244
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,127
- Mom!
- Stay there!

245
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:09,879
Are you going to kill her?

246
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,213
Mom!
I was...

247
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:17,595
- Mathacha! She has fainted!
- I will be back now!

248
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:18,596
Binamma!

249
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,139
Serve little buffalo meat!

250
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,849
My god! Mom...

251
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,768
Binamma!
Get some water soon!

252
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,144
coming!

253
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,480
My God! What happened to you?

254
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:29,440
Binamma, get some water

255
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,943
- I just enacted a scene!
- Water!

256
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:38,074
I just tested if my son still has
affection for me!

257
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,450
This is queer!

258
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,285
What are you looking at?

259
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,913
Get me two pieces of
duck meat and one appam!

260
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,666
- This is excessive!
- Are you a big...

261
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:52,630
Let me go to bed!

262
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,258
Granny!

263
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,889
When I mentioned your name...

264
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,975
...yesterday my uncle
was about to kill me

265
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,896
I don't think I can
hold out any longer!

266
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,898
You are bothered
about your problems only

267
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:14,235
I yearn to play in the band!

268
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,278
When Father asked me to play...

269
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,697
...I trembled

270
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,657
He drove me out

271
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,077
The other guy is now
wearing the shirt stitched for me!

272
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,579
If you couldn't play there
then you are unsuitable!

273
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,456
You play standing
beneath my window

274
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,959
Why are you not able to
play before a gathering?

275
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,461
You know everything!
Yet should you say this?

276
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,423
When I hold the clarinet
before a gathering...

277
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,466
...I get to see my dad drowning!

278
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,679
That makes my throat dry!
I would tremble!

279
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,265
Are you not ashamed to say
you are Esthappan master's son!

280
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:47,435
It will be better for you to discard this
and seek some other job

281
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,311
I wanted to become
a Father in church!

282
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,440
- You only prevented me
- Because I loved you...

283
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,900
But if you continue
to behave like a child...

284
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:57,319
...one day I would leave you!

285
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,413
They are celebrating their victory!

286
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,415
You don't waste time standing here!

287
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:13,002
Clean your clarinet
and put it on the attic

288
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,426
This is appam
Give it to your mom!

289
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,497
How great was this band?

290
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,792
Now every year we are losing
It has become a routine!

291
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,043
Gulp it!

292
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,795
Can you get me pork meat?

293
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:57,963
I would whack your throat

294
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,341
You have already devoured
2 Kgs of pork meat

295
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,968
Slug! Has lost the competition!

296
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,140
Jesus! He is crestfallen!

297
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:11,727
He is not playing the clarinet!
He is weeping through the instrument!

298
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,198
Take the boat to the toddy shop!
Today we must batter them!

299
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,964
My Lord! Thommeri Davis and
his group are coming here!

300
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,967
Don't know what is
going to happen today!

301
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,762
Guys! They are coming here!

302
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,856
"Granny's children!
You are a pain in the neck!"

303
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:57,773
"Will you not go?"

304
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:02,069
"Don't play an endless game
This is a queer lancet!"

305
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:06,532
"We don't want to win or lose!
We are incompetent!"

306
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,868
"Times have changed!
Appearances also have changed!"

307
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,912
"it is all seamed!
It is a raucous rooster call!"

308
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,627
"Losers became obdurate!"

309
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:23,048
"Why did your nose tip turn red?"

310
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,218
"Why is your gaze embarrassed?"

311
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,304
"Why your words are incisive?"

312
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,556
"Why is your gaze embarrassed?"

313
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,641
"Why your words are incisive?"

314
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,560
"Am I your kith and kin to clap?"

315
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,770
"Are you a rogue because
you consume Therutha's toddy!"

316
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,106
"Who am I to you!
Am I a brother or a bother to you!"

317
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,275
"Don't you want to be well disposed
with your neighbour!"
<font color="#00ff00"><font face="Palatino Linotype"><b>Team Jaffa [ExclusivE]</b></font></font>

318
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,736
"Did you not run away
without turning your back?"

319
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,529
"But now are you not panting?"

320
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:49,825
"After drinking toddy
you can't even stand erect!"

321
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,077
"Come straight to me!"

322
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:54,580
"Lying down and staying at home
You were shamed!"

323
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:58,959
"To win or lose,
you could not bid on us!"

324
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,878

It is a raucous rooster call!"

"Was it not Mariamma on the dais?"

327
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:29,365
"While she strip teased her
hubby would sit in front yard!"

328
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,953
"Look at the sun
alas! It appears like moon!"

329
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:37,623
"it is a rhythmic beat!"

330
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:42,211
"Scamp, come on perform!
How dare you abuse my dad!"

331
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,588
"You can't even uphold
your esteem and repute!"

332
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,757
"You scoffed others!
Have you got anything to say now!"

333
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,968
"When you strike back
and forth to wash dhoti..."

334
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,095
"...the dhoti went past
Bums did not notice this!"

were watching two bums..."

"...they were busy
making a mallet for a game!"

338
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,124
- Come here guys!
- Stop it!

339
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,795
Dogs! Defeat us in slugfest, if you can!

340
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,714
Anybody can combat anyone

341
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,298
If you mean slugfest,
come to our place!

342
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,717
We too have men at our place!

343
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,260
If we want to bash you...

344
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,680
...we would come to your house

345
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:35,848
Do you want to see that?

346
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,307
Then bash me!

347
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:41,395
You should have shown this spirit
while playing the band!

348
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,855
Move away!

349
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,860
Your dad Kochu Lonappan
taught me to play clarinet!

350
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,029
Do you know what he told me...

351
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:52,364
...when he gave me
the clarinet for the first time?

352
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:55,617
God blew soil and made man...

353
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,370
...and gave music to give life to man

354
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,792
Every time we breath
we are giving life to this clarinet

355
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:06,962
There is neither defeat nor
victory for a genuine musician

356
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,714
Only music dwells!

357
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:13,010
Do you mean to belittle our musicians!

358
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,929
If you have any self esteem,
compete and defeat them

359
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,806
Then deliver your discourse!

360
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:21,351
Even if the Gee Varghese Band
toils for 50 years...

361
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,604
...this trophy in the name of the Lord

362
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:28,108
...would stay before the garlanded photo
of my dad Kochu Lonappan

363
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,486
This is a challenge
thrown by Thommeri Davis!

364
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,612
Come Mariamma!

365
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,031
Don't blabber because you won this time!

366
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:34,698
Come or! guys!

367
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,702
We will show our mettle
in the next year's competition!

368
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,373
Year long toils for
teaching a band like this...

369
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,459
...and later dumping
in the attic is futile

370
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,420
It would be better to fart
in the backwaters rather than doing this

371
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:52,216
At least two bubbles would
surface and blast with a sound

372
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:57,221
Trumpet, Clarinet and yosr attires
keep everything on the attic!

373
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,599
Unless I tell you
no one should touch it!

374
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,267
Go to the other side of the bank

375
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:03,936
If you come this side again...

376
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,647
...we would drop you
guys in the backwaters!

377
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:26,250
- That is not required!
- Not like that!

378
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,627
Father! When our band was victorious...

379
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,714
Louis Pope and Esthappan master
were in the forefront!

380
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,384
When the boat capsized
with Mathoon and 4 other people...

381
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,262
...my son in law and Molamma
were also dead

382
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,265
Along with them our band
was also drowned!

383
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:44,518
That can't be viewed as insignificant!

384
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,689
Stop it!

385
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:53,610
We are hearing this story for years!

386
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:58,407
When there is a difference
of opinion on the church band...

387
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:02,286
...let us put to vote to decide
if we should continue the band or not?

388
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,371
Before that let this guy
give a reply, Father!

389
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:05,831
Let him respond!

390
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,708
He is silent when the church
committee is questioning

391
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,919
Under the circumstances
please don't think I am also raising an issue

392
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,005
We need an answer!

393
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:22,681
There was a time when
the Gee Varghese band was a big-name

394
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:26,935
Those days band
earned money for the church!

395
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,980
Those days even
if a key is defective in clarinet...

396
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,773
...a new clarinet would be given

397
00:36:32,191 --> 00:36:36,069
If someone can not play it right
he would be replaced by a new person

398
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:37,946
Those golden days of the church band...

399
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,407
...are now enjoyed by the Martha Mariam
band on the other side of the banks

400
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,284
Have anyone of you bothered to ask...

401
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:46,538
...how church band members
make a livelihood?

402
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:49,458
Our band members
fair Thoma and kochu Agusti...

403
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,794
...sold their houses and crossed
the waters to join their band

404
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,297
They did so out of poverty

405
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,343
For the last few years
the Gee Varghese band...

406
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,387
...is defeated by the church
and no one else

407
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:07,976
I don't have any
further elaboration on this!

408
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:12,773
Those present here
want to dissolve the band

409
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:16,068
Please inform this in
the Sunday Prayer mass, Father!

410
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:20,197
If the members of the parish
also have the same opinion...

411
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,949
I have nothing more to say

412
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,200
Come or! guys!

413
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,245
Go!

414
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,528
What is this pope!
<font color="#00ff00"><font face="Palatino Linotype"><b>Team Jaffa [ExclusivE]</b></font></font>

415
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:02,906
You have not completed it this time also
Half way through, is it not?

416
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:08,287
After the Edathuva Church festival
we were all returning in a boat

417
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,580
All those who accompanied were sleeping!

418
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,207
It was a bright full moon day!

419
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,252
Suddenly Esthappan took his clarinet...

420
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,046
...and started playing
a tune unheard until then!

421
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,009
In an excitement,
I also joined him!

422
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:25,012
All those who were sleeping got up!

423
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,972
In that bright moonlit night...

424
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:32,311
...amidst few of us, I felt it was
Saint sitting there right in the middle

425
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:37,983
In our experience none of us
have ever played such a tune...

426
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:42,404
After birth and death
you swim across to another point

427
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:43,947
It was such a bliss!

428
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:48,201
Esthappan used to tell me always...

429
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,579
...at a convenient time
we should reach the ultimate

430
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,247
But it did not happen

431
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:56,335
It could not be completed
by both of us!

432
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:57,919
Couldn't complete it

433
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,089
In life everything breaks
halfway through!

434
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,884
Esthappan and Molamma
are no more with us

435
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:07,095
ltteri, Kochu Thomma, Antappan
All of them have gone!

436
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:11,808
Now our band will also go!

437
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,685
I have witnessed it

438
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:18,148
After winning the trophies from
Edathuva, Chambakulam and Cherukara...

439
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:22,069
...you and Esthappan would reach
the shores of our place in boat

440
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,281
Who recalls all those days?

441
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,785
Relax yourself pope!

442
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,203
To set right all these...

443
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,040
Saint will send someone
This is my surmise!

444
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:34,474
This boat does not follow the safety
regulations stipulated by the government

445
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,810
For all those travelling in this boat...

446
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:41,106
...there is only one life jacket
and that is worn by me

447
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:44,317
If passengers sit quiet
this boat will reach shore!

448
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:53,762
Quite for some time
I wanted to sit with you people

449
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:57,766
Dead people are better than those living!

450
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,851
Cheers!

451
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:08,193
What is this?
Come on have a drink!

452
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,452
'ITTOOP LOTTERY
PAWN BROKERS'

453
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:22,207
ittoop brother! Boat has come
lam making a move

454
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,543
I said I am making a move!

455
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:40,642
Brother! Mom fainted!

456
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:43,562
Get her tablets!
Get money from lttoop's shop

457
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:44,771
lam going for collections!

458
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,856
You may go
I will get her tablets!

459
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:50,443
Seems you would wait for
the boat to return from the banks

460
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:53,363
You go home!
Mom is alone

461
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,615
Don't order me Clara, I will go!

462
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,827
Are you trying to stare me down?

463
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:02,831
If you misbehave with me, with the umbrella
I would throw you in the lake!

464
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:03,873
Let me see that!

465
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,584
Clara! You may go
The boat has arrived!

466
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,627
- Yabber!
- Go prattler!

467
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,754
Have this cashew!

468
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,650
Is he Saint Gee Varghese!

469
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:34,154
He has a lance with him
What he needs is a horse!

470
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,427
Give me a lime soda!

471
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,808
Brother! The church...

472
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:08,355
Are you not the son of
Puthukudi Thomas sir!

473
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,857
From America and then Bombay

474
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,484
How did you guess?

475
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:15,987
You are a replica of Thoma sir!
Can't I recogonize?

476
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:18,073
Where are your things?

477
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,950
It would come in the boat later
Now I have come!

478
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:22,994
Come on
Ride as my pillion!

479
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:24,996
I want to go to the church!

480
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,042
Will people coming to Kumarangiri
go home without seeing the Saint?

481
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,001
Get on to the bike

482
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:31,544
lam also going to the church!

483
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:33,630
This bike belongs to the church!

484
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:36,132
I am the sacristan, Ouseph!

485
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:38,426
Are you the sacristan!
Then let us go!

486
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:41,846
Brother!

487
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:53,108
Sacristan! Give this
to the senior Father!

488
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:56,361
Tell him Chachappan gave this!

489
00:44:56,444 --> 00:45:00,198
- What is the matter!
- I want to stop drinking!

490
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,535
Inform Father to pray
for me at a convenient time!

491
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:08,206
There is no urgency!
He can take his own time!

492
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,169
I will give him!

493
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:16,214
'But this fish will not reach church'

494
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,550
'It will reach the kitchen
at sacristan's house!'

495
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:22,721
'From there it will travel
to sacristan's intestine!'

496
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:24,222
'Amen!'

497
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:25,765
Hold this son!

498
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,311
Is he using the oil
meant for rockets in his bike?

499
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:35,984
Now you must buy
some lands in Kumarangiri

500
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:40,780
Marry a beautiful girl and settle here

501
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:43,032
I would arrange for everything!

502
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:49,914
What do you say?

503
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,292
There are lot of beautiful
girls in Kumarangiri

504
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,835
Shall I bring marriage proposals?

505
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,796
Is priests in our parish
allowed to marry?

506
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,298
Why do you ask this?

507
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,426
I am the new junior
vicar for this church!

508
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,095
Father Vincent Vattoli!

509
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:06,222
Fish!

510
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,693
Father! Praise the Lord!

511
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,446
All the time Praise the Lord!

512
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,742
I am the new junior
vicar - Vincent Vattoli

513
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,412
lam telling the truth!

514
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,372
I have come to take charge!

515
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:34,125
I am Father lrunnalamkuzhi
Joseph lrunnalamkuzhi!

516
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:37,879
Attuva parish vicar is my cousin
Father idannalamkulam!

517
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,840
But there was no information
about your arrival!

518
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,467
I had to come suddenly!

519
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,472
Where did you stitch this robe?

520
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:50,058
This is not stitched
It is ready made apparel!

521
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,351
Pants and shirt!

522
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,853
- What?
- Pants and shirt

523
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:56,356
Seems you didn't have time
to wear the priest's robe!

524
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:59,734
No Father! Priest robe can be worn
while doing religious duties!

525
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:01,528
I am used to wearing these!

526
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,824
I am comfortable in
these attire at normal times!

527
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,535
- What?
- Comfortable!

528
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:13,206
Besides, does our parish stipulate
wearing robes all the time?

529
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:16,334
You must be weary after the travel
Have some fruits!

530
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,710
- Come on!
- No thanks!

531
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,546
Then it is ok

532
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:25,760
A priest is a replica of Jesus
This is what I have learnt!

533
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,472
A replica of Jesus wearing
pants and shirts is little excessive

534
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:31,558
Is it not Vattoli?

535
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:38,106
When I am a vicar of this parish
I don't want any outside influences!

536
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:41,734
Glasses and shoes
Glasses and shoes!

537
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:46,364
Even otherwise there are few
revolutionaries in this parish!

538
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:50,785
This parish can not bear the brunt
of having another revolutionary Father!

539
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,372
So if you want to continue
as a junior vicar of this church

540
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:58,626
Change these attire and
wear the priest's robe!

541
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:00,712
Yes Father!

542
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,387
Is it permissible to have two
extra pockets in the robe?

543
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:13,558
I guess it is not permitted
Okay

544
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:21,816
Tomorrow morning will be
Vattoli's first mass!

545
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,985
Let me see how smart he is!

546
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,154
My god!

547
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,549
No problem! You can wear it!

548
00:48:48,051 --> 00:48:50,511
Seems the church band
lost this year also!

549
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,513
- Yes, we lost Father!
- What happened?

550
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,515
That is a big story!

551
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:58,311
Seems neighbouring parish
got the trophy this time also!

552
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:58,978
Right?

553
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:01,773
It was all planned!
They have lots of money!

554
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,275
Thommeri Davis and
his wife Mariamma

555
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:05,860
Both of them have lots of money

556
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:07,820
- Does Davis play?
- Never!

557
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:10,615
His dad Kochu Lonappan
used to play!

558
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:12,742
These people will make
others play their band...

559
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:15,495
...win the trophy and steal the limelight
Both of them

560
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,497
That lady is flashy!

561
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:20,083
She would wear a shirt,
dhoti and a dark glass!

562
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:20,875
Is it?

563
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,504
Solomon, attend the call

564
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,005
Father! I am scared to attend calls!

565
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:27,465
There are just 2 phones in this town!

566
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:30,343
One in contractor's house
and another one in church!

567
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:36,474
Your brother has
assumed charge in a church!

568
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:37,976
Can't you visit me?

569
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:42,647
His aunt in Kayankulam
slipped in bathroom!

570
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:44,732
We had been there
and just returned!

571
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,526
Give it to me!
Give

572
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,444
The jack fruit stain will
go on the phone!

573
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,362
Dear Brother in law!

574
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:50,613
Big brother in law!

575
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:52,240
Dear brother in law!

576
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,866
Big brother in law!

577
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:57,161
What is the news!
Did you not go home?

578
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:59,747
I had to come here
earlier for some wok

579
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:02,125
Any way, if you call
from the other banks...

580
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:04,627
...me and your sister
would reach there!

581
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:06,796
Did you meet Ottapla Father?

582
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:10,591
Yes I met him, taunted and
then only came here!

583
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:15,763
Your younger brother
is taunting Ottapla Father!

584
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:19,684
Have you started your pranks!

585
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:23,604
If I come to know any of
your mischieves there...

586
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,481
I would immediately
come there in a boat!

587
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:26,607
Ok

588
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,111
Is it your sister, Father?

589
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,614
We have only one sister, Mariamma!

590
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:36,117
- You know her
- Is it?

591
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,662
She is married to
Thommeri Davis of the other bank!

592
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:44,709
I take leave Father!
It is time to ring the bell!
<font color="#00ff00"><font face="Palatino Linotype"><b>Team Jaffa [ExclusivE]</b></font></font>

593
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:46,127
Solomon, wait!

594
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,880
You complained about
my sister and brother in law

595
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,548
How can you leave just like that!

596
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,175
I don't know anything

597
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,677
Vincent Vattoli from Changanaserry...

598
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,972
Why should he choose Kumarangiri
parish to become a junior vicar?

599
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,098
Do you know Solomon?

600
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:00,683
I don't know Father!

601
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,936
Will the church band
survive tomorrow's voting?

602
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,064
What do you think Solomon?

603
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,066
I don't know about that too, Father!

604
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:09,942
But I have understood one thing!

605
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:12,070
It is a concerted planned move!

606
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,657
Gee Varghese band does not
belong to the church alone!

607
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:19,827
It belongs to this town and
also to the Lord in this church!

608
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,622
I don't want anything
to happen to the band!

609
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:44,727
Before we decide to continue or not
the Saint Gee Varghese band...

610
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:48,731
...our church's new
priest Father Vincent Vattoli

611
00:51:48,815 --> 00:51:51,984
...would address you briefly!

612
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:10,086
I saw this place for the first time
on a new year day long ago!

613
00:52:10,378 --> 00:52:11,796
I was a young child then!

614
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,049
I was like the little son
sitting in front!

615
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,343
<i>- What is your name son'?
- Joy men!</i>

616
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:19,303
I was like Joy mon!

617
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,432
That day my dad said
something to his brother!

618
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:25,017
That is still ringing in my ears!

619
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:26,978
In Kumarangiri, one can't find a person...

620
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:31,023
...who has not hummed a song or
who has not fallen in love at least once

621
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:32,733
When I stepped in to this place...

622
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:36,487
...my dad and uncle
took me first to this church!

623
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:39,949
Through the big gathering...

624
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:44,120
...what struck me first
was a priceless thing!

625
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:48,499
People who came out of the church
touched and caressed that!

626
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,084
It is still vivid in my memory!

627
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,754
After many years I have returned
to this place as a priest!

628
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,924
When I entered
the Saint's church again...

629
00:52:57,008 --> 00:53:02,388
...my eyes were looking
for that invaluable thing!

630
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:20,031
It is there
It is still here!

631
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:03,741
When I returned on that day
in boat with dad and uncle...

632
00:54:03,783 --> 00:54:07,745
...along with ice stick and toys
I took along one more thing

633
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,956
The music of this town!

634
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:14,168
The music of this place made
Kumarangiri renowned!

635
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:17,755
That music was shared
to everyone who lived here...

636
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:20,049
...by the saint Gee Varghese band!

637
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:23,302
That band is now like
this neglected piano...

638
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:29,350
...full of dust and is getting
ready to receive its last rites!

639
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:35,273
Esthappan master, ltteri,
Kochu Thommy, Antappan

640
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:39,527
What was drowned in the lake
was merely their bodies!

641
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:44,448
You have forgotten all of them
After having lost all near and dear...

642
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,575
...Pope Louis is, still living
for the sake of music!

643
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:48,536
If you don't want him...

644
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,956
...you would be losing
the soul of Kumarangiri

645
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,125
...and also Kumarangiri's music

646
00:54:55,084 --> 00:55:00,089
Let that music bring back excitement
and integration of this town

647
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:03,467
Should we not submit
the ever rolling trophy...

648
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,261
...at the feet of the saint again?

649
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,680
What do you say Lonappan brother?

650
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,433
Don't you want ittoop brother?

651
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:18,524
- What about you Joy mon?
- I want

652
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:21,902
Should we dissolve the church band?

653
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:25,573
No
No

654
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:28,200
No

655
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:59,148
Father! You could have
contested the election!

656
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:01,650
I have contested and won too!

657
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:10,618
"The entire village looked
in overwhelming surprise!"

658
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:13,621
"From where did this
divine messenger come?"

659
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:17,291
"You caress while weaving
a tender leaf garland!"

660
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:21,754
"You have changed the feeble wind!
Is it a fortune for this town?"

661
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:25,758
"Your flair is throbbing
and shining outwardly!"

662
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,635
"Welcome you
Welcome you!"

663
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,512
"You are a pulsating fortitude!"

664
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,347
"Vattoli father's gait
is graceful and rhythmic"

665
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,349
"it's a rhythmic sway
to left and right!"

666
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:37,478
"Have you not noticed
his captivating smile!"

667
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:41,357
"How elegant he is!
It is a treat to watch!"

668
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,984
"We are endowed with this gift today!"

669
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,486
"Vattoli!"

670
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:49,281
"His words are coated with honey!
His looks are serene!"

671
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:51,450
"You are a fortune to this town!"

672
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,661
"Vattoli"

673
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:04,463
"The gentle breeze
from south is nippy!"

674
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:09,677
"To get over the chill
you fell in campfire and wine!"

675
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:18,936
"The gentle breeze
from south is nippy!"

676
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:25,401
"To get over the chill
you fell in campfire and wine!"

677
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:27,361
"Sunshine of Kumaram!"

678
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:29,405
"Good people vowed for betterment..."

679
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:33,701
"...you sprouted like a golden ray
from a mango seed!"

680
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:37,413
"You are like Kuravilangadu saviour!
Country's first sailor captain!"

681
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:41,542
"it is cherubic!
The song and rhythm!"

682
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:45,463
"Like an harvest
let us celebrate!"

683
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,134
"Vattoli!"

684
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,641
"Vattoli!"

685
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,229
"Vattoli!"

686
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,667
"Vattoli!"

687
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,420
He is wearing pants and sun glasses!

688
00:58:26,504 --> 00:58:27,963
Is he a Father?

689
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,135
Saint has sent us Vattoli Father!

690
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:35,429
- Sufficient for one load
- My god!

691
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:27,064
Say so
You are an artist!

692
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:32,444
Yesterday I thought why should
a Father coming from eastern hill side...

693
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:35,614
...argue for Gee Varghese band?

694
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:38,158
That is why I said only
those who drink toddy...

695
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,828
...will know the taste
of the carp fish!

696
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:42,871
Is it not?

697
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:44,999
Come in!

698
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,377
Have you seen her Father?

699
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:50,629
She is from France
Michelle

700
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:52,590
All those who came
with her have returned!

701
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:55,384
She wants to learn our music
and stayed back!

702
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:58,012
Her parents are not in
agreement with her

703
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,263
She is a smart girl!

704
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:02,224
Child! This is Father Vincent!

705
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:04,518
He is our church's new junior vicar!

706
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:10,274
Pappan! Shouldn't
Solomon practice playing!

707
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:14,153
Let him first learn
to hold it properly Father!

708
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,113
Is it not Charlie?

709
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,660
When one plays it should not be
merely blowing out air!

710
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:23,621
Music should also come!

711
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,473
You are a Father in the Church!

712
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:44,058
Yes

713
01:00:46,644 --> 01:00:49,688
But the other day you danced
with me in the boat!

714
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:53,150
I understand English!

715
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:56,236
But I like to talk in Malayalam!

716
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,490
I can understand Malayalam!

717
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,951
What is wrong in both of us
dancing together?

718
01:01:03,494 --> 01:01:07,414
People and your culture...

719
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,167
...would miscon-

720
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:12,127
Will not misconstrue

721
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:16,507
People with good intentions
never misconstrue!

722
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,926
They will look at us
as two human beings!

723
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,831
It is like a cinema scene!

724
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:33,000
You dog!
Go

725
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:52,770
Stop there!

726
01:02:55,731 --> 01:03:00,110
You need not bathe
at home sacristan!

727
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:04,990
I did not insist on selling
the house...

728
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:06,867
...because I don't want you
and kids to be left in lurch!

729
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:07,993
I have made some computations

730
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:09,870
I will take a decision
shortly about that!

731
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:11,872
Then you decide quickly
and inform us

732
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:13,499
Should we also not know about it?

733
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,584
- You...
- Don't do it dad!

734
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:16,460
Hope you know...

735
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:19,254
If I consider the interest and
compound interest Esthappan owe...

736
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:22,090
...even if the house is sold
you may have to pay me

737
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:23,675
Went there to help them!

738
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:27,471
Come fast!
I left the dinner half way

739
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:30,057
'The food leftover by sacristan...'

740
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:36,396
'...would have been by now
consumed by his pet dog Chakki!'

741
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:39,066
'The deal for Chakki will follow'

742
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:55,916
Stay there!

743
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:06,844
'That night 7 1/2 year old chakki
died due to sacristan's fatal blows!'

744
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:16,562
ls there anything tastier than this?

745
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,647
Couldn't you get some fish?

746
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,068
Is anything stuffed in your throat?

747
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:26,113
No point in opening your mouth
when you come for food!

748
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,615
Do you know what is
happening here?

749
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:29,575
How will you know?

750
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:31,702
All the time you roam around
carrying the clarinet!

751
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,871
My dad's name is Esthappan!

752
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:35,330
I will roam with the clarinet!

753
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:38,083
I care a damn
if others feel bad about it!

754
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,669
For one week I have been
telling you to change the bulb!

755
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,671
Today mom went there
and fell down

756
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:46,758
Until now she was screaming!
She has just gone to bed!

757
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:02,858
When can I see you thriving?

758
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:07,905
I will die only after
seeing you well off

759
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,619
I don't know mom!

760
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:23,337
Don't cry dear

761
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:31,970
Clara!

762
01:05:32,721 --> 01:05:35,182
- Is Solomon not there?
- He is inside!

763
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:35,974
What is it?

764
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,559
He has been asked
to go to the church!

765
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:39,311
Junior Vicar has a session!

766
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,562
Is it?

767
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:42,397
Yes, bro

768
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:44,024
I have just come from church!

769
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,193
You may leave!
I will go

770
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,746
Give me some water, Clara!

771
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,122
No

772
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:00,999
I asked because of thirst!

773
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:31,238
Does this hen lay eggs?

774
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:35,033
No, it lays orange
Shall I get some?

775
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,997
Give that vessel
I have other works to do

776
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:43,250
Wait for a moment!

777
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:46,253
I saw you keeping the paper there!

778
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,046
Seems you took great troubles!

779
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:52,050
If you drink water like this
you will find time only to urinate!

780
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:53,468
Have you not gone yet?

781
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,511
Get into the boat!
I am coming!

782
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:55,929
Has Nancy come for delivery?

783
01:06:55,971 --> 01:06:56,888
Yes

784
01:06:57,973 --> 01:06:59,057
Go hen!

785
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:07,649
In whose house is the session?

786
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:10,569
Looks like at the contractors house!

787
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:11,570
My God!

788
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,953
- Sebi!
- Brother!

789
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,671
Father! Should I accompany?

790
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:32,632
If I come, they may not like it!

791
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:33,759
You keep quiet!

792
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:36,928
We don't go for sitting
on such criteria

793
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:39,347
Philipose!

794
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,515
What is it in the sac?

795
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:43,310
It is hen's dung,
manure for plantains

796
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:45,020
Take care not to soil your foot!

797
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:47,147
It has a good smell!

798
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,149
What is this Father?

799
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,694
Will it be possible to hang
on the comb of a rooster?

800
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,782
Because your family is big
your parents would have...

801
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:59,367
...vowed to make one of them
a Father, is it so?

802
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:04,498
Father Ottaplakal only
does sacraments at our house!

803
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,125
The Senior Vicar considers them
as insignificant!

804
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:10,128
Let it happen
The saint will forgive!

805
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,142
Where are you going?

806
01:08:24,226 --> 01:08:26,186
I am going for a blessing!

807
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,231
Will you not come
for the band practice in the evening?

808
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,113
Seems you are close with the lady!

809
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:40,450
Poor girl! She is very religious!

810
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:43,954
Will blessing the house
make it alright?

811
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:44,704
Do one thing!

812
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:46,915
I will give you the holy book
and holy water!

813
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:51,044
You may do it and return them
at your convenience to the church!

814
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:54,798
You sit quiet,
but give knockout punches!

815
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,924
Keep quiet you dog!

816
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:57,884
I would jab at your vital spots!

817
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,097
Don't take it seriously
It is somniloquy

818
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:03,390
He is not drunk!

819
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,935
Lord! Let this holy water
provide protection...

820
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:08,895
...from evil spirits and
all that is unholy

821
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,063
Amen!

822
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,401
Blessing is over

823
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:16,319
Someone from the house
read the bible!

824
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:17,487
Child!

825
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:24,035
Psalms of Solomon!

826
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,413
The sacred poems from 1 to 10

827
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:32,377
<i>Let HIM kiss me with his lips</i>

828
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:35,672
Your Love for me is absorbing

829
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:38,508
Your oil is fragrant!

830
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:45,223
Your name is like an oil stream
So virgins love you!

831
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:49,311
Draw me to follow you!
We would run together!

832
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:53,440
You dog!

833
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:54,900
Are you showing roguery in my house?

834
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,484
- Mathacha!
- My God!

835
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:58,445
Leave him
Mathacha! Don't hit him!

836
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,739
Move away!

837
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:03,825
Run away from here! Run!
Father! Move away!

838
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:08,038
- I would kill you beggar!
- Stay quiet!

839
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:12,792
How dare he enters our house
and make our girl...

840
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:14,878
Father! Take him away!

841
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:15,879
Go!

842
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:17,881
- You dog!
- Calm down!

843
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:21,259
We will drown our girl
and burn you fellow!

844
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:23,803
Get to the other banks
Go man!

845
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:29,601
- Solomon!
- Never mind Father!

846
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:52,791
Do you know father...

847
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,377
Actually I wanted to join the seminary!

848
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,378
Then...

849
01:10:58,964 --> 01:11:00,465
It was Shoshanna who...

850
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:12,936
When your people said...

851
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,272
...have you started with your
belongings to join the seminary?

852
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:17,148
What are you talking Shoshanna?

853
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,525
He got a divine call!

854
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,819
Then what else will he do
other than joining the seminary?

855
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:21,695
You move away!

856
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,530
Give me the number
of the God who called him!

857
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,532
Let me ask,
if he called him?

858
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:28,535
When did I call?
I have not called anyone!

859
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,328
What are you talking?

860
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:31,830
Is the God carrying a phone?

861
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,581
You move away!
The boat will go now!

862
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,459
Have you forgotten
the blooming at school?

863
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:37,711
What is that man?

864
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:39,546
- Blooming!
- What does that mean?

865
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,715
Blooming is a word!

866
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:45,927
What did I give to guys like Francis,
Anto and Raghu who gave me letters?

867
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,887
- What did she give?
- Blows!

868
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,181
What did I give you?

869
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:51,474
What did she give you?

870
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:53,351
- Kiss!
- Kiss?

871
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,603
Have you not heard about kiss?

872
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:59,024
At the cemetery bushes
what did you do to me?

873
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:01,568
At the cemetery bushes
what did you do man?

874
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,738
Don't you know what is done
at the cover of bushes?

875
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:07,699
Shoshanna! I am like your dad...

876
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:10,493
...I tell you even if the leaf falls
on the thorn or thorn falls on leaf

877
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:11,369
Move away!

878
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,470
It is confirmed the sacristan
has fallen down!

879
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:30,430
- My God!
- Stay there man!

880
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:32,557
I want to know
your decision right now!

881
01:12:32,599 --> 01:12:34,976
Do you want to join seminary
and become a Father in church...

882
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,103
...or do you want to marry me
and father my children?

883
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,897
I would father your children!

884
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:40,648
What?

885
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:44,069
I would like to be
father of your children!

886
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:00,627
Heard you called me Father!

887
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,004
Heard it is urgent,
so I rushed here!

888
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:07,384
More than 1500 people have signed
and sent a petition...
<font color="#00ff00"><font face="Palatino Linotype"><b>Team Jaffa [ExclusivE]</b></font></font>

889
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:09,219
...to the Bishop's house!

890
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:12,639
The demand is to remove
Father Ottaplakan who is...

891
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,517
...the vicar of Kumarangiri parish
for the last 15 years!

892
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,478
Today Bishop called Father
and told him to change...

893
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,522
...parish after the church's festival!

894
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:26,528
We know not even a stone moves in
Kumarangiri without your knowledge

895
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:30,949
Who spearheaded the petition drive
got signatures of so many people...

896
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,701
...and sent it to the Bishops's palace?

897
01:13:39,374 --> 01:13:42,877
This assignment should reach
the destination safely!

898
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:44,796
My saint!

899
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:47,507
Sacristan!
That is...

900
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:50,176
Any problem in revealing the name?

901
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:54,305
Though it is true
how can I betray persons in the group?

902
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,599
I am also a witness
to the preparation of petition...

903
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,393
...and making people signatories!

904
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:00,103
It was done by...

905
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:07,527
Is it not the Gee Varghese band group
maintained by the church for decades?

906
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:08,319
Right?

907
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:09,821
I swear on Lord and saint...

908
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,656
...I am not involved in this!

909
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:13,408
I told Louise Pappan
and Chali Pappan...

910
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,578
...umpteen times not to do this!
They did not pay heed

911
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,087
When I eased myself
what a great relief!

912
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,382
Dog faeces!

913
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:40,393
What is it Pappa!
Have you started early today?

914
01:14:42,187 --> 01:14:44,481
What is it in the boat?
Is it shrimps?

915
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:03,208
Good riposte for Pappan's music!
Who is it?

916
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:06,211
Might be someone from
Davi's band on the other banks

917
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:10,757
Then take this one!

918
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,812
That is Esthappan's style!

919
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:27,774
Who is there to play this?

920
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:36,491
- Who is it?
- I can't see!

921
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:38,451
There is no light in the boat!

922
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,124
Go close to that boat!

923
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,178
Give that light to me!

924
01:15:58,263 --> 01:16:01,891
Who is this vying
to compete with Pappan?

925
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:14,195
My God!
Solomon! Was it you?

926
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,408
From whom did you
learn this my son?

927
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,703
- Come near me!
- Go there!

928
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:23,162
Go there!

929
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:25,623
Let me see your face once!

930
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:38,177
My Esthappan is not dead!

931
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,890
My Esthappan's music is
also not dead!

932
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:46,102
Play my Son!
Play!

933
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:24,015
'When Louis Pappan
learned Esthappan's son...'

934
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:27,477
'...Solomon is a wizard,
it was exactly 7 hours and 2 minutes'

935
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,772
'The same evening,
the mother duck did not know...'

936
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:33,149
'...if the egg was dropped
in lake or boat'

937
01:17:33,191 --> 01:17:37,320
'...looked perplexed
and was staring at the sky!'

938
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:41,783
'Without losing a moment, an arched
coconut tree over the backwaters...'

939
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:44,035
'...dropped a red coconut in water!'

940
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:48,581
'The same evening Shoshanna's marriage
with Davis's nephew Alby...'

941
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:54,045
'...settled in US was verbally
finalised by Philipose contractor'

942
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:59,467
'Esthappan master and Angels
were sulking after a game'

943
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:07,642
'Ink spread on the speech I was
preparing for the next day mass'

944
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:12,855
'At that time Ottplakkan Father
was worried about his parish change '

945
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:17,777
'Sacristan Kochu Ouseph was
closing the church doors with a bang!'

946
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,787
How old is this church sacristan?

947
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:12,290
Must be 300-400 years old!

948
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:18,504
Then balks and rafters
would have attenuated

949
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:21,340
The roof and terrace
would have eroded!

950
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,969
Then any time the church's roof...

951
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:28,598
...may fall on those assembled
for prayers in church!

952
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:29,974
Yes Father!

953
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:35,271
Should we not protect
the Kumarangiri devottees!

954
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,899
A Father thus protecting
the Kumarangiri people...

955
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,026
...should never be
disturbed from this parish!

956
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:43,237
We would send a petition
to this effect to the Bishop's palace!

957
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:45,031
We would certainly send one!

958
01:19:45,156 --> 01:19:47,283
The responsibility of building
the new church...

959
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:51,621
...would be given
to the devotee Philipose contractor

960
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:53,456
- Is it not Father?
- Yes

961
01:19:53,623 --> 01:19:57,335
So the sacristan
will oversee the renovation...

962
01:19:57,376 --> 01:20:02,215
...and the vicar of the church would close
his eyes to some of the deeds of sacristan

963
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:22,568
'AMEN'

964
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:37,542
I saw...l saw!

965
01:20:38,626 --> 01:20:45,466
Wearing red silk and an armour
sitting on a snow white colour horse

966
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,718
I saw our saint!

967
01:20:48,803 --> 01:20:54,433
'Kumarangiri church's terrace,
balks rafters and pillars are weakened!'

968
01:20:55,059 --> 01:21:02,191
'Ottaplaka! Before its roof fall
on the head of my beloved people...'

969
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:08,447
'...Kumarangiri church must be rebuilt'
Our Saint said this to me

970
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:10,157
He said

971
01:21:47,111 --> 01:21:51,157
"Is it not a fete ordained from above?"

972
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:55,369
"Did not the saint say it univocally?"

973
01:21:55,453 --> 01:22:01,876
"if postponed,
it will ravage generations!"

974
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:07,173
"Who said it is
a command from above?"

975
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:11,344
"Don't sow lies that would not sprout!"

976
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:17,058
"it's easy to demolish!
But difficult to build and raise!"

977
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:21,145
"Don't we need a wall
to draw the cross?"

978
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:25,524
"Don't we need
a church to assemble?"

979
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:48,923
"To save our esteem under the sky,
don't we need a roof?"

980
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:53,386
"To hold the roof,
don't we need a firm wall?"

981
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:57,473
"Don't we need a roof
and wall for the church?"

982
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:28,462
"Doesn't the church
need staff and musicians?"

983
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:32,675
"Doesn't the church need
a bell and a sacristan?"

984
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:33,384
"What...what?"

985
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:37,430
"Like the old one
don't we need a new birth?"

986
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:41,350
"Should not the church
also have a transformation?"

987
01:23:41,434 --> 01:23:43,519
"Doesn't the church need
an edifice and a tower?"

988
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,521
"Doesn't the church
need a wall and a chamber?"

989
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:48,524
"To raise a new one
need to demolish the present one"

990
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:51,902
"We can demolish
and build a new one"

991
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:17,511
"Whether the church is there or not..."

992
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:19,889
"...don't wreck our boozing!"

993
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,559
"if we don't get booze..."

994
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:27,563
"We would stir up!
Would stir up!"

995
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,607
"if the church is there or not..."

996
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,860
"...is there or not
ls there..."

997
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:34,862
"Can't demolish the church"

998
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:38,032
"We can't"

999
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:40,159
"Demolishers hands would burn!"

1000
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:42,620
"Hands would burn!"

1001
01:24:43,621 --> 01:24:45,623
"We would demolish!"

1002
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:47,541
"You don't demolish!"

1003
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:51,587
"We would demolish!
You don't demolish"

1004
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:55,591
"We would demolish!
You don't demolish!"

1005
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:59,595
"We would demolish!
You don't demolish!"

1006
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:03,599
"We would demolish!
You don't demolish!"

1007
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:07,603
"We would demolish!
You don't demolish!"

1008
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:11,190
"We would demolish!
You don't demolish!"

1009
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:14,819
"We would demolish!
You don't demolish!"

1010
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:37,800
She is far away Solomon!

1011
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:38,569
Philipose contractor is smart!

1012
01:26:39,153 --> 01:26:41,488
Without anyone knowing
in this side of the lake...

1013
01:26:41,572 --> 01:26:45,993
...he took her to a church
across the lake for engagement!

1014
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:51,165
Seeing the American groom
she has fallen flat!

1015
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:54,710
You take two pieces of this!

1016
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:57,963
Bite the sorrow and
push down the throat Solomon!

1017
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:02,343
Paila! ls there pork meat in kitchen?

1018
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:05,471
- Is it there mom?
- Must be there in the vessel!

1019
01:27:07,348 --> 01:27:11,185
It is a never ending sorrow mom!

1020
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:19,485
Don't you know Solomon
that women are treacherous!

1021
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:23,572
On the night of a festival in church...

1022
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:28,202
...do you know with whom
my hubby eloped to Tamilnadu?

1023
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:31,413
...It was my own sister
That whore...!

1024
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:32,373
My god!

1025
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,334
What is it?

1026
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:36,377
Chain got entangled!

1027
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:39,171
- What!
- Chain got entangled!

1028
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:42,383
Solomon his chain got entangled!

1029
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:44,843
- All of you hear this!
- Where did it get entangled!

1030
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:48,597
- Mom! Don't put me to shame!
- You are a shameless guy!

1031
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,057
- Go fellow!
- Is he not your son!

1032
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,768
He is wearing a long chain
like a father and...

1033
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:59,650
My Jesus! You have given me
a son who is a...

1034
01:28:02,236 --> 01:28:03,237
<i>l am going...</i>

1035
01:28:06,991 --> 01:28:14,331
Solomon! Wear your dhoti and go!

1036
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:21,964
Poor fellow!
He has started drinking toddy!

1037
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,597
God has given you a talent!

1038
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,309
Instead of refining
and polishing that talent...

1039
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,269
...you were after a girl
See what has happened?

1040
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:36,729
When she saw another guy...

1041
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,356
...did she not prove
she is her father's daughter!

1042
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:42,693
During mornings,
have you ever visited the band?

1043
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:44,862
In 4 month's time
we have the competition!

1044
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:47,614
If you are not serious
you will not play this time!

1045
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:50,951
You are not a person to become
obscure because of a girl!

1046
01:28:51,035 --> 01:28:54,913
Go, have a sound sleep and
come for tomorrow's practice!

1047
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:55,914
Father!

1048
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:04,006
It was like a idiotic act, Father!

1049
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:07,259
They were determined
not to inform me beforehand!

1050
01:29:07,426 --> 01:29:10,512
I learnt the girl is Shoshanna
only after going there!

1051
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:18,437
If I tell you something,
will you do it for me Father?

1052
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:20,064
What is it Solomon?

1053
01:29:42,294 --> 01:29:44,630
Enough Father!
We can go

1054
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:46,632
That window will not open hereafter!

1055
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:50,094
I will stop playing clarinet from today!

1056
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,390
I think you can decide on that
after getting down from my shoulder!

1057
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:05,109
Father to the left!

1058
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:06,568
To the right Father!
To the left!

1059
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:07,945
Father!

1060
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:29,842
Your name is like an oil stream
So virgins love you!

1061
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,720
Draw me to follow you!
We would run together!

1062
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:40,811
I want to see you
both together before I die

1063
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:42,688
Granny!

1064
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:24,021
Her marriage is fixed

1065
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:26,857
Why should she come here?
That too with him!

1066
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,568
Mathacha! She is my daughter!

1067
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:31,361
She will honour her words!

1068
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:33,197
We have fixed her marriage!

1069
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,282
Besides! She is right in front of us!

1070
01:31:35,407 --> 01:31:37,326
Yes
If I say...

1071
01:31:37,701 --> 01:31:39,077
What happened?

1072
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:43,749
- Has the power gone?
- Is it power shutdown!

1073
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:46,710
Power is resumed!

1074
01:31:47,878 --> 01:31:51,215
My God! Jesus and Mary are missing!

1075
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:53,383
It is a festival
and it is in procession

1076
01:31:53,467 --> 01:31:55,469
But we can't avoid saying this

1077
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:58,680
- Who's face it is?
- Ours!

1078
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:20,118
Boat is coming!
You may go

1079
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:21,745
I will take care of the rest!

1080
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,631
Brother in law!
What is this?

1081
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:34,007
You are having a lance and crown!
<font color="#00ff00"><font face="Palatino Linotype"><b>Team Jaffa [ExclusivE]</b></font></font>

1082
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:36,093
Who is this?
Is it Jesus?

1083
01:32:37,094 --> 01:32:39,846
- Is it not Shoshanna?
- Davis! Don't let him go

1084
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:44,851
Don't let him go!
Catch him!

1085
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:52,818
- Matha! Don't beat him
- Don't beat

1086
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:54,486
Leave me...

1087
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:03,287
Father, please tell them
to stop beating me

1088
01:33:03,829 --> 01:33:06,039
Father, please tell them
to stop beating me

1089
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:29,980
I don't have any share in this blood!

1090
01:34:07,351 --> 01:34:09,019
Let someone call Father

1091
01:34:09,102 --> 01:34:11,188
Let Father take a decision on this!

1092
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:14,191
He has abducted a girl
whose engagement is over!

1093
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:16,318
He is not doing a sacristan's job!

1094
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:17,569
You beggar!

1095
01:34:17,653 --> 01:34:19,696
See the venomous guy's stance!

1096
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:23,200
If we don't get a decision on this
We would kill him today!

1097
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:26,078
- Leave him
- He would die

1098
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:28,747
- Leave him!
- Move away!

1099
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:31,541
Shoshanna from a respectable family
is engaged to another respectable family

1100
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,460
Are you trying to tarnish
our family esteem?

1101
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:34,461
You sacristan!

1102
01:34:34,544 --> 01:34:36,129
If anyone touches him...

1103
01:34:36,213 --> 01:34:40,759
...he would not leave
Kumarangiri with that hand

1104
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:42,302
- Move away
- You...!

1105
01:34:42,386 --> 01:34:44,888
<i>'</i> Stop it!
- You...!

1106
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,641
Our girl was abducted
The loss is ours!

1107
01:34:47,724 --> 01:34:49,476
But you are trying to overawe us?

1108
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:51,311
Who abducted your daughter?

1109
01:34:51,395 --> 01:34:53,063
They have eloped!

1110
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:56,024
The entire town knows they are lovers!

1111
01:34:56,108 --> 01:34:59,611
But did you not fix her
marriage with another guy?

1112
01:34:59,695 --> 01:35:04,616
If the children love each other
You must help them to get married!

1113
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,535
Damn it!

1114
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:09,913
Come here girl!
She is my only child

1115
01:35:09,955 --> 01:35:10,914
Have you understood?

1116
01:35:10,956 --> 01:35:13,166
Then for what fu****g thing
are you here?

1117
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,584
- You are...
- Stop I say

1118
01:35:14,668 --> 01:35:19,673
The entire town knows
the status of a sacristan of this church!

1119
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:21,341
Every one here is involved in love

1120
01:35:21,425 --> 01:35:23,343
The sacristan is in love here!

1121
01:35:23,427 --> 01:35:25,679
- Stop it man
- Leave it man

1122
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:30,600
He is not a mere sacristan!
He is a good artist too!

1123
01:35:30,684 --> 01:35:31,977
He is my Esthappan's son!

1124
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:35,981
Artist! Does he have
any value in Kumarangiri?

1125
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:40,068
Does he have a penny with him?
His intentions were different!

1126
01:35:40,152 --> 01:35:44,406
If he married my daughter,
he can eat for life time without a job

1127
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:48,452
Even otherwise for quite some time
Kumarangiri people have started devouring

1128
01:35:48,535 --> 01:35:51,037
Sitting on terrace and
whistling passersby at junction...

1129
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:52,456
...are the only thing they know

1130
01:35:52,539 --> 01:35:55,292
ls there a single person here
who knows to play clarinet?

1131
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:57,461
Damn with Louis Pappan
and his group!

1132
01:35:57,544 --> 01:36:01,006
They play in some toddy shop
unnoticed by anyone!

1133
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:05,135
Does anyone in Kumarangiri
including Esthappan's son...

1134
01:36:05,177 --> 01:36:06,803
...has the guts to
come forward and play?

1135
01:36:06,887 --> 01:36:09,556
If they climb the dais
they would urinate!

1136
01:36:11,475 --> 01:36:12,934
Take it from me!

1137
01:36:13,018 --> 01:36:16,605
If the Gee Varghese band
is playing for the coming new year

1138
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:19,441
Solomon would be at the forefront!

1139
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:22,360
For the last 17 years
you have never come near the dais

1140
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:23,862
Will you play in the band?

1141
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:25,197
I will...

1142
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,698
Then will you win the trophy?

1143
01:36:26,782 --> 01:36:29,326
Tell him brother!
We will win the trophy!

1144
01:36:30,202 --> 01:36:31,203
We will win!

1145
01:36:31,495 --> 01:36:34,080
If the clarinet I play has life...

1146
01:36:34,164 --> 01:36:36,750
If the saint in this church is true...

1147
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:39,044
We will occupy the dais and play!

1148
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,337
We will win the trophy!

1149
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:43,507
And we will dedicate it
to the saint too!

1150
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:50,972
In case you win the trophy
we will offer last <i>8</i> years prize money...

1151
01:36:51,056 --> 01:36:53,058
...won by Martha Mariam band to this boy!

1152
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:54,476
Is it not contractor?

1153
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:55,393
Yes!

1154
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:57,562
Shoshanna was engaged to our boy!

1155
01:36:57,604 --> 01:36:59,981
If you win the trophy,
we offer to marry Shoshanna to Solomon

1156
01:37:00,065 --> 01:37:01,942
Tell contractor,
you would abide it!

1157
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:03,068
I would!

1158
01:37:03,944 --> 01:37:05,737
- If it is otherwise...
- Tell me

1159
01:37:06,488 --> 01:37:07,823
Tell Pappan!

1160
01:37:08,323 --> 01:37:11,785
Gee Varghese band
will never play again!

1161
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:15,455
We will decide Shoshanna
is not destined to marry Solomon!

1162
01:37:16,206 --> 01:37:17,541
That is enough!

1163
01:37:19,376 --> 01:37:20,377
Stop it!

1164
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:30,387
Whatever is said here does not bind
the church or the vicar of this church

1165
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:33,765
But we did not ask you
take this responsibility

1166
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:37,978
Not only that,
for a band of this type...

1167
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:40,772
...church will not spend a penny!

1168
01:37:40,856 --> 01:37:43,775
The church no longer
is associated with this band!

1169
01:37:44,985 --> 01:37:47,070
The church can only ban the band

1170
01:37:47,112 --> 01:37:49,030
You cannot forbid us
from competing!

1171
01:37:49,114 --> 01:37:52,659
We will get a person to sponsor
the band from this side of the bank itself!

1172
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:55,579
Let us see that
Bye Pappan!

1173
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,122
Will see you at the competition!

1174
01:37:57,163 --> 01:37:57,831
We will

1175
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:00,542
Do you know who helped
the junior sacristan in abduction?

1176
01:38:00,584 --> 01:38:02,127
It was the junior vicar!

1177
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:04,129
Mathacha take leave and come!

1178
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:05,589
- Come!
- Solomon...!

1179
01:38:05,672 --> 01:38:06,840
Come, let's go

1180
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:09,175
Instead you could have killed me!

1181
01:38:24,024 --> 01:38:28,028
Father! Where should I keep this?
I mean this lance and crown!

1182
01:38:29,863 --> 01:38:34,618
Father Vincent Vattoli!
Pack your belongings

1183
01:38:35,201 --> 01:38:39,706
Don't forget to take your
pants, shirt and sun glasses!

1184
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:42,292
Hereafter you may not
have to wear a robe!

1185
01:38:43,168 --> 01:38:47,714
You need not waste time
until tomorrow morning to vacate!

1186
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:51,718
I have not done anything so far
that my conscience did not permit

1187
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:55,180
lam damn sure it will not
happen henceforth too!

1188
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:01,853
Wait Father!

1189
01:39:02,646 --> 01:39:07,442
Senior Vicar feels you are against
the demolition of the church!

1190
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:09,194
This ire is because of that!

1191
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:11,112
What do you want me
to do sacristan?

1192
01:39:11,196 --> 01:39:14,199
You should not
impede his actions

1193
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:16,743
Demolishing the church
stopping the church band...

1194
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:21,039
...or preventing lovers coming together
Which one I should not impede?

1195
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:24,417
I said this because of my love
for you, Father!

1196
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:27,212
But if you help a devotee
coming to church...

1197
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:29,839
...and a helper of the church to elope

1198
01:39:29,923 --> 01:39:31,758
Will the locals tolerate you Father?

1199
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:34,302
Sacristan! I have not made any vow...

1200
01:39:34,386 --> 01:39:37,097
...to continue in Kumarangiri parish
amidst so many hardships

1201
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:38,682
I would pack my things
and will be ready!

1202
01:39:38,765 --> 01:39:40,809
When you get information
from the Bishop's palace, call me!

1203
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:42,102
Ok Father!

1204
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:46,648
Pappan! What made you
wager my affair with Shoshanna...

1205
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:47,899
...for a band competition?

1206
01:39:47,983 --> 01:39:53,154
If Pappan did not do that together
both sides would have killed you

1207
01:39:53,238 --> 01:39:56,157
Solomon don't you believe
our band can stage a show?

1208
01:39:56,241 --> 01:39:57,450
How is it possible, Pappan?

1209
01:39:57,534 --> 01:40:00,245
All these years, all of you tried
and could not succeed!

1210
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:01,788
How will I do it?

1211
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:04,749
Even after engagement with another guy
Shoshanna came with me!

1212
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:06,793
How will I pacify her?

1213
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:08,795
All of you have ruined my life!

1214
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:11,089
Pappan! On what basis
you thought we can...

1215
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:12,966
...win the trophy with Solomon
at forefront!

1216
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:14,467
Thoma! Keep quiet!

1217
01:40:14,551 --> 01:40:19,597
Seems Pappan forgot our efforts
for this band for many years!

1218
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:24,144
Has he proved his caliber
for you to support him?

1219
01:40:24,811 --> 01:40:27,605
Who are you to say we would
stop playing band if we lose this time!

1220
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:29,816
For the sake of a
good for nothing fellow...

1221
01:40:29,858 --> 01:40:33,319
...should we stop playing band
It was a bit excessive Pappan!

1222
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:40,660
Don't you want others to hear
the music you held back all these years!

1223
01:40:40,744 --> 01:40:42,662
Don't you need your girl?

1224
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,832
My Esthappan's son!
Tell me

1225
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:48,126
They would not win, son!

1226
01:40:48,668 --> 01:40:51,129
Tell me
Will not we win?

1227
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:54,966
If your decision is final,
then we don't like to play in this band!

1228
01:40:55,050 --> 01:40:58,720
If that is band master's decision,
Solomon would play from forefront

1229
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:00,180
And we would win the trophy!

1230
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:01,473
I tell you!

1231
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:04,476
If anyone is opposed to Solomon
as the lead player...

1232
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:05,393
Tell that right now!

1233
01:41:05,477 --> 01:41:07,353
Chali Pappan!
Why are you <i>so</i> worked up?

1234
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:10,774
For quiet some time
I have been planning this for you!

1235
01:41:10,857 --> 01:41:14,152
Don't think no one knows
about your behind the scene maneuvers!

1236
01:41:14,235 --> 01:41:17,030
I don't want to see you
around the band anymore!

1237
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:18,782
Go man!
Go dog!

1238
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:29,709
Who is coming here
at this midnight?

1239
01:41:50,355 --> 01:41:54,150
From now on Gee Varghese band
is not run by the church!

1240
01:41:54,192 --> 01:41:56,486
I, Chachappan is going to
sponsor the band henceforth!

1241
01:41:56,528 --> 01:42:00,657
Even if it means spending a lot,
I don't mind!

1242
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:01,825
I am not doing this for fun!

1243
01:42:01,908 --> 01:42:05,662
Gee Varghese Saint
told me to do it!

1244
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:19,384
'That night Ottaplakal Father
and Ouseph sacristan...'

1245
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:22,345
'...also had a dream
that could not be deciphered '

1246
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:27,058
Father Vincent
is a son of my cousin!

1247
01:42:27,142 --> 01:42:30,019
This is his first parish
Let him continue here!

1248
01:42:30,103 --> 01:42:33,773
- Yes!
- Let it be so!

1249
01:42:33,857 --> 01:42:36,234
Then you think about it
and do what is required!
<font color="#00ff00"><font face="Palatino Linotype"><b>Team Jaffa [ExclusivE]</b></font></font>

1250
01:42:36,317 --> 01:42:37,318
Yes!

1251
01:42:42,323 --> 01:42:45,869
'Next day morning Vishakol Pappan
crossed the waters and joined...'

1252
01:42:45,952 --> 01:42:49,414
'...Thommeri davis's Martha Mariam Band'

1253
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:02,218
"You fluttered!"

1254
01:43:02,302 --> 01:43:06,514
"Weary eyes!
Go to sleep!"

1255
01:43:07,307 --> 01:43:09,893
"Weary eyes!
Go to sleep!"

1256
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:13,813
"My heart is stirred up"

1257
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:17,734
"it's full of desires!"

1258
01:43:19,277 --> 01:43:21,779
"Will you not give yours!"

1259
01:43:22,906 --> 01:43:30,997
"You held my fingers
even without me knowing it!"

1260
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:38,796
"Soulfully...! One day
when we dine together..."

1261
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:43,051
"...my colours would bloom in sky"

1262
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:46,137
"...bloom in sky"

1263
01:43:46,804 --> 01:43:50,850
"In the rainbow of my psyche..."

1264
01:43:50,934 --> 01:43:54,771
"...would sound the cherubic amen!"

1265
01:43:54,854 --> 01:43:58,775
"In the rainbow of my psyche..."

1266
01:43:58,858 --> 01:44:02,946
"...would sound the cherubic amen!"

1267
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:26,302
"Honey! I initially I looked for you"

1268
01:44:26,386 --> 01:44:34,060
"Would commingle
with your soulful emotion!"

1269
01:44:34,143 --> 01:44:41,442
"Go without informing me...
Arrogant guy!"

1270
01:44:41,526 --> 01:44:45,446
"Came back on account of
bewitching love!"

1271
01:44:45,530 --> 01:44:49,450
"The twilight is a blooming season!"

1272
01:44:49,534 --> 01:44:58,501
"Finally when we unite,
it will be intense passion!"

1273
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:02,797
"Rainbow of my psyche..."

1274
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,884
"...would resound the cherubic amen!"

1275
01:45:06,968 --> 01:45:10,930
"Rainbow of my psyche..."

1276
01:45:11,014 --> 01:45:15,351
"...would resound the cherubic amen!"

1277
01:45:31,034 --> 01:45:34,412
Ponnappa!
Don't take the boat close!

1278
01:45:34,495 --> 01:45:35,705
Go straight!

1279
01:45:35,997 --> 01:45:39,834
I have something to talk to Father!

1280
01:45:40,752 --> 01:45:44,088
Is this your regular work Father?

1281
01:45:44,172 --> 01:45:46,007
I mean, abduction!

1282
01:45:48,885 --> 01:45:52,138
Don't stare Father!
They are my friends!

1283
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:53,890
He is Mr.Ernakulam

1284
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:56,601
He is...runner up!

1285
01:45:58,978 --> 01:46:04,609
Father! For one day
can I take her with me?

1286
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,541
Amen!

1287
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:25,004
Dear Kumarangiri residents!

1288
01:46:25,088 --> 01:46:28,132
For the 50th Gee Varghese
ever rolling Trophy...

1289
01:46:28,216 --> 01:46:32,095
...there will be a three day
Band competition at Church Premises

1290
01:46:32,178 --> 01:46:33,763
We welcome you all

1291
01:46:33,846 --> 01:46:39,852
The next day after the competition
our church's demolition work will commence

1292
01:46:39,936 --> 01:46:43,272
Hence from the same day
prayers and worships...

1293
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:47,693
...would be held in the temporary thatched shed
at contractor Philippose's premises

1294
01:46:47,777 --> 01:46:49,362
Son! Did you call me?

1295
01:46:50,029 --> 01:46:54,409
Here is a son who farts
and a mom who responds to farts!

1296
01:46:55,451 --> 01:46:59,247
Son! Don't suspect
the anus that farted!

1297
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:02,333
If you wipe it with sand
you can eat it with rice flakes!

1298
01:47:04,544 --> 01:47:06,838
In the boat that reached
the jetty that day

1299
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:10,716
There were 3groups who are going to rewrite
the history of Kumarangiri maintenance

1300
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:16,472
One was an archaeologist to take
a final decision on demolition of church

1301
01:47:16,597 --> 01:47:22,687
Second was two thugs imported
by Contractor Philippose to handle Solomon

1302
01:47:22,728 --> 01:47:25,314
Vikraman
Muthtu

1303
01:47:25,898 --> 01:47:27,608
Come
Walk

1304
01:47:28,943 --> 01:47:30,278
It is not yet over!

1305
01:47:30,403 --> 01:47:34,157
Third one - to drub Gee Varghese Band...

1306
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:38,202
Thommeri Davis paid
to bring from Fort Kochi

1307
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:40,121
Chavelier Pothachan!

1308
01:47:41,456 --> 01:47:44,041
So this is Kumarangiri!

1309
01:47:44,125 --> 01:47:45,877
Sir! Jetty is on this side!

1310
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:47,503
He has gone!

1311
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:49,922
Hold my hand!
This side

1312
01:47:50,006 --> 01:47:51,174
- Where?
- Here!

1313
01:47:52,008 --> 01:47:54,093
Anyway I am drenched!

1314
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:59,182
I will be there at the shop!
You just come there!

1315
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:07,940
- Saint has come earlier
- Who is this guy?

1316
01:48:08,107 --> 01:48:10,735
Is this the horse or is it snake?

1317
01:48:29,587 --> 01:48:31,797
On inspection, we are convinced that...

1318
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:35,051
...there is substantial weakening
to the church building!

1319
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:38,387
Kumarangiri church has to
be demolished and rebuilt!

1320
01:48:38,471 --> 01:48:40,723
We don't see any other way out!

1321
01:48:56,072 --> 01:48:57,198
Come or! guys!

1322
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:02,662
How about it sir!

1323
01:49:02,954 --> 01:49:06,582
Is it sufficient to maul him
or should we break his limbs?

1324
01:49:11,587 --> 01:49:15,841
Therutha! Get me two bottles of toddy!

1325
01:49:33,526 --> 01:49:36,529
He is Pothachan
Chavelier Pothachan!

1326
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:39,240
Davis has brought him
from fort Kochi!

1327
01:49:50,209 --> 01:49:53,129
So if we bribe even any
ancient thing is vulnerable!

1328
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:55,631
Is it not engineer?
Have one more egg!

1329
01:49:57,049 --> 01:50:01,304
Ancient thing will be vulnerable
But not public works or maintenance!

1330
01:50:01,846 --> 01:50:06,851
Break his fingers
so that he can not...

1331
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:08,561
...can not happen

1332
01:50:08,644 --> 01:50:10,896
Dear! Do you know who they are...?

1333
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:13,149
Poor girl! She does not know

1334
01:50:13,733 --> 01:50:17,528
They are the accused in
the stabbing case of North station SI

1335
01:50:17,612 --> 01:50:19,363
Vickraman and Muthu!

1336
01:50:19,447 --> 01:50:22,033
I brought them
To give few blows to him!

1337
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:24,201
They are in doubt whether to
break his hands or legs!

1338
01:50:24,243 --> 01:50:25,494
For the present they are
biting the leg piece!

1339
01:50:25,578 --> 01:50:26,746
Poor fellows!

1340
01:50:29,081 --> 01:50:31,250
Shall I serve you some chicken curry?

1341
01:50:52,313 --> 01:50:55,232
You never told me your
daughter is a hothead!

1342
01:51:27,056 --> 01:51:32,228
Who are the bootlicks
of Gee Varghese band?

1343
01:51:32,978 --> 01:51:34,855
Were you asking for me?

1344
01:51:37,274 --> 01:51:40,194
If so, I am right
in front of you, Pothacha

1345
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:47,201
Pappa! Seems you have
lost your old drive!

1346
01:51:49,078 --> 01:51:54,583
If someone plays, don't you
have the strength fight back

1347
01:51:58,963 --> 01:52:02,174
"Desires were benumbed!"

1348
01:52:02,258 --> 01:52:05,344
"Hands wearing rings hardened"

1349
01:52:05,428 --> 01:52:08,973
"But mind alone...
mind alone..."

1350
01:52:19,442 --> 01:52:24,447
First time, at the Kanjoor church
for Saint Sebastian's festival

1351
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:25,406
Is it not?

1352
01:52:26,323 --> 01:52:29,452
Later at Saint Sebastian's
festival at Chalakudy church!

1353
01:52:29,535 --> 01:52:32,288
At Ollur Gabriela angel's festival

1354
01:52:33,456 --> 01:52:37,626
Lastly at Kottamam Sain't Rocke's festival

1355
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:40,045
That day you floored me!

1356
01:52:41,213 --> 01:52:43,841
I was shamed and heard insults!

1357
01:52:45,217 --> 01:52:48,012
I think that was the last time, right?

1358
01:52:48,721 --> 01:52:53,017
No, I was waiting for your return!

1359
01:52:53,142 --> 01:52:55,936
Esthappan left without giving us a chance

1360
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:58,522
Now you are the only one left

1361
01:52:58,606 --> 01:53:01,817
I have some scores to settle!

1362
01:53:02,276 --> 01:53:06,113
I have not come
to Kumarangiri for money!

1363
01:53:06,155 --> 01:53:08,616
Not for wine or women!

1364
01:53:09,492 --> 01:53:14,497
I want to defeat you at least once!

1365
01:53:15,289 --> 01:53:17,208
I am obdurate about it

1366
01:53:17,291 --> 01:53:20,127
For this time you may discard that desire!

1367
01:53:21,462 --> 01:53:24,381
Come next time
I will lose it for your sake!

1368
01:53:26,759 --> 01:53:28,344
No Pappan!

1369
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:31,764
I have promised Thommeri Davis!

1370
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:35,976
I have assimilated years of
learning, playing and hearing

1371
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:38,562
I have come well prepared!

1372
01:53:39,563 --> 01:53:41,941
I would not give up, Pappan!

1373
01:53:42,149 --> 01:53:48,531
I have also made a promise to deceased
colleagues and to Kumarangiri Saint

1374
01:53:48,614 --> 01:53:50,282
That can't be changed!

1375
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:03,379
You have an eternal soul
that defies death!

1376
01:54:03,712 --> 01:54:05,464
Jesus!

1377
01:54:20,354 --> 01:54:26,485
I will leave this place
only after shattering that!

1378
01:54:36,954 --> 01:54:38,455
So we will meet!

1379
01:54:44,169 --> 01:54:45,045
Come guys!

1380
01:54:50,676 --> 01:54:53,679
My Jesus! This is the first time...

1381
01:54:53,762 --> 01:54:58,225
...a guy is visiting this shop who consumes
glass pieces along with toddy!

1382
01:54:58,309 --> 01:55:02,229
"Ascent, ascent thus!
Hold your breath and ascent!"

1383
01:55:02,313 --> 01:55:05,024
"We can not now afford to lose!"

1384
01:55:05,107 --> 01:55:06,233
"Can not afford...!"

1385
01:55:06,317 --> 01:55:10,279
"Those who can't, may leave
if they are work-shy!"

1386
01:55:10,362 --> 01:55:11,864
"This is our last chance!"

1387
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:14,074
"if we don't win
it will be a shame!"

1388
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:15,868
"Will confront them
To succeed..."

1389
01:55:15,951 --> 01:55:18,162
"...let us start our work sans barriers!"

1390
01:55:18,203 --> 01:55:20,164
"Commensurate with talent
elegance soars!"

1391
01:55:20,205 --> 01:55:22,541
"We have esteem and regard too!"

1392
01:55:22,625 --> 01:55:26,170
"Don't you want to be in dais
Come all of you!"

1393
01:55:26,211 --> 01:55:28,380
"it's excitement everywhere!"

1394
01:55:28,464 --> 01:55:31,175
"Join us
Come, come!"

1395
01:55:31,216 --> 01:55:34,386
"Come, come!
Come, come!"

1396
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:36,305
"Break the barrier!"

1397
01:55:36,388 --> 01:55:40,142
"Join the band
Join, join!"

1398
01:55:40,184 --> 01:55:42,186
"Join, join
Join, join!"

1399
01:55:43,145 --> 01:55:44,271
"You be the blaze!"

1400
01:55:44,355 --> 01:55:46,607
"Come together!
Come, come!"

1401
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:51,111
"Come, come
Join, join!"

1402
01:55:51,195 --> 01:55:52,321
"Break and recast!"

1403
01:55:52,404 --> 01:55:53,572
Mike check!

1404
01:55:53,822 --> 01:55:58,035
Farid! Bring sugar less tea and laddu!

1405
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:01,914
Dear countrymen, friends!

1406
01:56:01,997 --> 01:56:04,917
I have come
with a solution for everything!

1407
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,588
Davis band's fair
Thoma's brother Paulachan...

1408
01:56:09,672 --> 01:56:12,216
...would marry Clara
without demanding a penny!

1409
01:56:12,257 --> 01:56:15,928
I mean the Paulachan who is
working in the Cashew factory!

1410
01:56:16,053 --> 01:56:19,765
After the festival Solomon can play
in the Davis band at a good salary

1411
01:56:19,974 --> 01:56:24,186
This is the house document
I took from Esthappan

1412
01:56:24,228 --> 01:56:27,731
Besides all this,
I take the responsibility...

1413
01:56:27,856 --> 01:56:32,778
...to see he marries Shoshanna
at the Kumarangiri Church!

1414
01:56:32,861 --> 01:56:37,157
Tell us what we should do
in return for all these favours!

1415
01:56:37,533 --> 01:56:39,618
She has understood it!

1416
01:56:39,702 --> 01:56:44,164
Just do one thing
A help that does not damage anyone!

1417
01:56:44,707 --> 01:56:47,543
You should not play in the competition!

1418
01:56:48,293 --> 01:56:52,297
"Our band is named after the saint!"

1419
01:56:52,381 --> 01:56:55,259
"Whoever confronts us will lose!"

1420
01:56:55,718 --> 01:56:57,720
"Victory is not yours!"

1421
01:56:57,803 --> 01:56:59,680
"The honour is ours!"

1422
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:04,768
"We know you bring
outsiders and thugs!"

1423
01:57:04,852 --> 01:57:07,521
Matthai! Is it time for lunch?

1424
01:57:07,604 --> 01:57:12,735
"Even if we lose
we walk with head held high!"

1425
01:57:12,818 --> 01:57:14,278
"Go man!"

1426
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:16,905
- The programme is about to start!
- Let it be

1427
01:57:16,989 --> 01:57:19,283
- How is my uniform?
- Splendid!

1428
01:57:19,324 --> 01:57:21,493
- Shall I ask you something?
- What is it?

1429
01:57:21,577 --> 01:57:25,998
In this uniform I look taller than you
and my pomp has enhanced!

1430
01:57:26,081 --> 01:57:27,916
Now how should I call you mom?

1431
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,835
Call me aunt!

1432
01:57:31,003 --> 01:57:34,298
My brother trembles
when he takes the clarinet

1433
01:57:34,339 --> 01:57:36,133
He is going to lead the band

1434
01:57:36,216 --> 01:57:38,510
I can even give you
a signed document!

1435
01:57:38,552 --> 01:57:41,096
The church band will never win!

1436
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:42,639
Are you ready for a bet?

1437
01:57:42,723 --> 01:57:44,308
What about you brother!

1438
01:57:48,062 --> 01:57:48,854
SQ"!

1439
01:57:48,937 --> 01:57:50,522
Solomon! Please wait!

1440
01:57:50,606 --> 01:57:51,857
Let me tell you!

1441
01:57:52,608 --> 01:57:57,696
Solomon! I know you play better
than your dad Esthappan

1442
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:59,948
If you play the band would win too

1443
01:58:00,699 --> 01:58:03,952
After the competition you may play
Play anywhere you like!

1444
01:58:04,453 --> 01:58:07,456
What will they pay you
for this service?

1445
01:58:09,249 --> 01:58:13,545
Do you know what will happen to
a family if the church excludes them?

1446
01:58:13,629 --> 01:58:16,465
You will not get rice
Not even a crystal of salt

1447
01:58:16,548 --> 01:58:17,966
Will not get water!

1448
01:58:19,093 --> 01:58:23,013
Not even a child in the parish
would talk to the family
<font color="#00ff00"><font face="Palatino Linotype"><b>Team Jaffa [ExclusivE]</b></font></font>

1449
01:58:23,222 --> 01:58:26,433
Mom and children may have
to leave the place in midnight!

1450
01:58:27,559 --> 01:58:29,937
The saint is inside the cage!

1451
01:58:30,062 --> 01:58:34,441
But all functions are carried out
by the father and the sacristan!

1452
01:58:49,665 --> 01:58:53,669
"Our band is named after the saint!"

1453
01:58:53,752 --> 01:58:57,214
"Whoever confronts us will lose!"

1454
01:58:57,297 --> 01:58:59,049
"Victory is not yours!"

1455
01:58:59,133 --> 01:59:01,176
"The honour is ours!"

1456
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:07,349
"We know you bring
outsiders and thugs!"

1457
01:59:07,683 --> 01:59:14,231
"Even if we lose
we walk with head held high!"

1458
01:59:14,314 --> 01:59:17,609
"Go man!"

1459
01:59:36,712 --> 01:59:39,840
Clara! How did we play?

1460
01:59:39,923 --> 01:59:41,592
Will we reach the Last Eight?

1461
01:59:42,426 --> 01:59:43,760
Tell me

1462
01:59:43,844 --> 01:59:45,554
I will be confident, If you say

1463
01:59:49,224 --> 01:59:50,058
Viewers!

1464
01:59:50,142 --> 01:59:53,645
For the second
round <i>8</i> teams have been selected!

1465
01:59:53,729 --> 01:59:55,147
I will read out the names!

1466
01:59:55,230 --> 01:59:58,567
Makkamman Mary Matha Band!

1467
02:00:00,819 --> 02:00:03,906
Vettikavalam Eso Band!

1468
02:00:05,741 --> 02:00:09,661
Next is Chenkaiyil Chamayam Band!

1469
02:00:11,997 --> 02:00:15,000
Thommeri Martha Mariam Band!

1470
02:00:17,461 --> 02:00:20,714
Attookara lruvetta Band!

1471
02:00:22,883 --> 02:00:25,719
Kurisadi Cherupushpam Band!

1472
02:00:27,554 --> 02:00:30,766
Kuruvithalam OK band!

1473
02:00:33,602 --> 02:00:38,190
And last Kumarangiri Gee Varghese Band!

1474
02:00:51,954 --> 02:00:55,415
Boss, for your happiness
I have done a thing!

1475
02:00:55,499 --> 02:00:56,333
What is it?

1476
02:00:56,416 --> 02:00:59,127
I removed the reed from Solomon's
clarinet and scathe it on floor!

1477
02:00:59,211 --> 02:01:02,172
So he could not play
How will he play without reed?

1478
02:01:02,256 --> 02:01:03,924
His church cleaning job
would end today!

1479
02:01:04,007 --> 02:01:05,175
You idiot!

1480
02:01:05,676 --> 02:01:07,511
It should be a manly contest!

1481
02:01:07,594 --> 02:01:11,223
Don't deceit to win!
Get lost

1482
02:01:11,348 --> 02:01:13,267
I don't want
to see you in the band!

1483
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:15,227
- Leave the place
- Go man!

1484
02:01:17,521 --> 02:01:19,314
He can't be blamed!

1485
02:01:19,523 --> 02:01:21,817
The sacristan asked him
to scratch the reed!

1486
02:01:22,067 --> 02:01:23,360
So...

1487
02:01:27,572 --> 02:01:29,241
Can't be blamed!

1488
02:01:30,575 --> 02:01:31,910
Never mind Solomon!

1489
02:01:32,244 --> 02:01:34,579
Anyway we are not
out of the competition!

1490
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:39,376
You must think only
about tomorrow now!

1491
02:01:39,626 --> 02:01:41,128
This has happened today

1492
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:43,880
It should manifest
your resoluteness tomorrow!

1493
02:02:00,272 --> 02:02:04,276
"Oh when the saints go marching in..."

1494
02:02:04,359 --> 02:02:08,196
"When the saints go marching in..."

1495
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:12,576
"Oh lord I want to be in that number..."

1496
02:02:12,617 --> 02:02:16,872
"When the saints go marching in"

1497
02:02:16,955 --> 02:02:20,917
He may be sheepish!
But he is Esthappan's seed!

1498
02:02:21,001 --> 02:02:23,003
This time he would revel!

1499
02:02:24,254 --> 02:02:28,258
"No one with us, but truth!"

1500
02:02:28,383 --> 02:02:32,304
"The saint is always with us!"

1501
02:02:32,387 --> 02:02:36,308
"The saint is always with us!"

1502
02:02:36,391 --> 02:02:38,143
"The saint is always with us!"

1503
02:02:38,226 --> 02:02:43,231
Dear people! A plantain cluster donation to
Makkammam Mary Matha band!

1504
02:02:43,315 --> 02:02:43,982
Move away man!

1505
02:02:44,066 --> 02:02:45,817
This is plucked from my grove!

1506
02:02:45,901 --> 02:02:47,527
Thief!
Thief!

1507
02:02:47,986 --> 02:02:50,155
Encourage him

1508
02:02:50,322 --> 02:02:51,615
Get down man!

1509
02:02:51,656 --> 02:02:53,241
- You thief!
- Go man!

1510
02:02:53,325 --> 02:02:54,451
You drunkard!

1511
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:55,994
Go man

1512
02:02:56,078 --> 02:02:58,830
Friends! Another happy news!

1513
02:02:58,914 --> 02:03:04,503

...by Chakkarakara Ambrose!

1515
02:03:08,673 --> 02:03:11,927
Go guys!
Has anyone laid eggs here?

1516
02:03:12,844 --> 02:03:17,682
Friends! For the 2nd day's
Semi final competitions...

1517
02:03:17,766 --> 02:03:22,646

1518
02:03:22,687 --> 02:03:24,856
lam announcing the band names!

1519
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:28,276
Makkammam Mary Matha Band!

1520
02:03:28,944 --> 02:03:32,114
Kurisadi Cherupushpam Band!

1521
02:03:32,781 --> 02:03:36,660
Kumarangiri Gee Varghese Band!

1522
02:03:37,035 --> 02:03:40,455
Thommeri Martha Mariam Band!

1523
02:03:55,137 --> 02:03:57,806
Why do you touch and kiss
the horse and the snake?

1524
02:03:57,889 --> 02:04:00,684
Saint or the horse or the snake...!

1525
02:04:00,725 --> 02:04:03,979
Let anyone of them
help the band to win!

1526
02:04:05,313 --> 02:04:06,690
My Saint!

1527
02:04:07,482 --> 02:04:09,526
"We can not now afford to lose!
Can not afford...!"

1528
02:04:09,609 --> 02:04:11,695
"Those who can't may leave
if they are work-shy!"

1529
02:04:11,736 --> 02:04:13,238
"This is our last chance!"

1530
02:04:13,321 --> 02:04:15,407
"if we don't win
it will be a shame!"

1531
02:04:15,490 --> 02:04:17,325
"Will confront them
To succeed..."

1532
02:04:17,409 --> 02:04:19,411
"...let us start our work sans barriers!"

1533
02:04:19,494 --> 02:04:21,496
"Commensurate with talent
elegance soars!"

1534
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:23,957
"We have esteem and regard too!"

1535
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:27,544
"Don't you want to be in dais
Come all of you!"

1536
02:04:27,627 --> 02:04:29,671
"it's excitement everywhere!"

1537
02:04:29,713 --> 02:04:30,547
"Join us
Come, come!"

1538
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:33,175
Father! if you look from here...

1539
02:04:33,258 --> 02:04:37,762
...with the instrument and uniform
he resembles Esthappan!

1540
02:04:37,929 --> 02:04:40,557
If you mull over
It does not augur well

1541
02:04:40,849 --> 02:04:44,769
If the church band climbs the stage
it will expose our vulnerability

1542
02:04:45,645 --> 02:04:49,733
"Those who can't may leave
if they are work-shy!"

1543
02:04:49,774 --> 02:04:51,359
"This is our last chance!"

1544
02:04:51,443 --> 02:04:53,445
"if we don't win
it will be a shame!"

1545
02:04:53,528 --> 02:04:55,280
"Will confront them
To succeed..."

1546
02:04:55,363 --> 02:04:57,491
"...let us start our work sans barriers!"

1547
02:04:57,574 --> 02:04:59,576
"Commensurate with talent
elegance soars!"

1548
02:04:59,659 --> 02:05:01,912
"We have esteem and regard too!"

1549
02:05:01,995 --> 02:05:05,540
"Don't you want to be in dais
Come all of you!"

1550
02:05:05,624 --> 02:05:07,709
"it's excitement everywhere!"

1551
02:05:07,751 --> 02:05:11,463
"Join us
Come, come!"

1552
02:05:11,546 --> 02:05:13,507
"Come, come!
Come, come!"

1553
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:19,304
Dear friends! In the competition
held at Kumarangiri church...

1554
02:05:19,387 --> 02:05:23,225
Two teams are selected
for the last round!

1555
02:05:23,308 --> 02:05:24,893
I am reading out the names!

1556
02:05:25,143 --> 02:05:28,480
Kumarangiri Gee Varghese Band!

1557
02:05:37,572 --> 02:05:41,785
Thommeri Martha Mariam Band!

1558
02:06:56,776 --> 02:07:01,740
No one in Kumarangiri would have thought
you would play clarinet so well!

1559
02:07:02,616 --> 02:07:06,286
I was also diffident!

1560
02:07:12,584 --> 02:07:15,170
- Is this a new one?
- No, it is an old one Father!

1561
02:07:15,545 --> 02:07:18,048
So, tomorrow will you play with this?

1562
02:07:21,509 --> 02:07:23,678
So the church band will win, right?

1563
02:07:24,596 --> 02:07:28,350
For your sake
you want me to lose!

1564
02:07:42,739 --> 02:07:47,994
Now play tomorrow
and try <i>to</i> win!

1565
02:08:06,137 --> 02:08:08,640
My God! What is it?

1566
02:08:09,849 --> 02:08:12,769
Son! What happened?

1567
02:08:14,479 --> 02:08:17,732
Jesus! Tell me son!

1568
02:08:17,982 --> 02:08:19,776
How will I play tomorrow!

1569
02:08:21,111 --> 02:08:22,445
My clarinet...

1570
02:08:25,031 --> 02:08:27,283
To play, I...

1571
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:59,691
Is this not dad's?

1572
02:08:59,774 --> 02:09:01,735
I don't want to learn
what happened!

1573
02:09:01,985 --> 02:09:04,404
Tomorrow you are playing with this!

1574
02:09:11,953 --> 02:09:16,791
It is our dad's desire that you
should play with this at stage tomorrow!

1575
02:09:18,293 --> 02:09:25,842
I didn't know my brother
is a whizz than our dad!

1576
02:09:26,176 --> 02:09:27,594
I didn't know about it!

1577
02:10:43,795 --> 02:10:48,466
Shoshanna! Don't ask me
where is the clarinet you gave me?

1578
02:10:49,092 --> 02:10:50,593
That is no more with me

1579
02:10:51,594 --> 02:10:53,096
This is my dad's

1580
02:10:53,847 --> 02:10:55,265
Esthappan master's!

1581
02:10:56,140 --> 02:10:59,727
Wherever he has taken this or used
he has seen only victories!

1582
02:11:00,687 --> 02:11:02,730
But I am not Esthappan master!

1583
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:06,317
Have I ever won?

1584
02:11:08,111 --> 02:11:12,115
If I take the stage tomorrow,
our band will lose!

1585
02:11:13,157 --> 02:11:14,492
I am going!

1586
02:11:15,118 --> 02:11:16,452
I can't...

1587
02:11:16,744 --> 02:11:19,664
Will you go?
Will you lose?

1588
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:25,295
If you lose, along with you Louis Pappan
who has faith in you will also lose

1589
02:11:26,462 --> 02:11:28,131
Kumarangiri will also lose!

1590
02:11:30,258 --> 02:11:31,843
Don't you want to win?

1591
02:11:33,845 --> 02:11:35,597
Don't you want to marry me?

1592
02:12:17,305 --> 02:12:20,725
Whose screams you were
responding at this midnight?

1593
02:12:20,892 --> 02:12:21,935
I will go!

1594
02:12:22,185 --> 02:12:25,188
If my Solomon calls I will
go even if it is midnight!

1595
02:12:41,412 --> 02:12:44,040
Tomorrow will be your guys
last day playing of the instrument!

1596
02:12:44,082 --> 02:12:47,585
Let me see how you will
reach the church premises!

1597
02:12:48,252 --> 02:12:50,505
Until we return
from the church tomorrow...

1598
02:12:50,546 --> 02:12:51,798
...don't open the door!

1599
02:12:53,424 --> 02:12:56,427
Aunt! Ask him to open the door!

1600
02:12:57,011 --> 02:12:59,514
Brother! Open it!

1601
02:13:06,104 --> 02:13:09,232
Vattoli! Are you going to hit me?

1602
02:13:14,362 --> 02:13:18,866
I don't want others to know
about certain things!

1603
02:13:19,242 --> 02:13:20,702
Tell me, what it is!

1604
02:13:25,373 --> 02:13:27,625
What you did yesterday
were deeds not supposed...

1605
02:13:27,709 --> 02:13:29,377
...to be done by a person
wearing the robe!

1606
02:13:29,419 --> 02:13:30,420
What is it?

1607
02:13:30,712 --> 02:13:32,714
You broke Solomon's clarinet...

1608
02:13:32,797 --> 02:13:36,009
...you don't even qualify
to be a human being, Father!

1609
02:13:36,718 --> 02:13:40,304
I am wearing this robe
for the last 40 years!

1610
02:13:40,722 --> 02:13:45,935
You need not teach me
the do's and don'ts of wearing this robe!

1611
02:13:47,979 --> 02:13:52,066
Diocese has not given you robe and
authority to help a girl whose engagement...

1612
02:13:52,150 --> 02:13:55,194
...is over to elope with someone!

1613
02:13:56,571 --> 02:13:59,407
One does not become
a father to work against...

1614
02:13:59,490 --> 02:14:05,496
...the church, diocese,
superiors and noble Christians

1615
02:14:07,290 --> 02:14:11,127
Bible says a tree
that does not produce fruit...
<font color="#00ff00"><font face="Palatino Linotype"><b>Team Jaffa [ExclusivE]</b></font></font>

1616
02:14:11,210 --> 02:14:13,546
...will be cut down
and thrown into the fire

1617
02:14:14,297 --> 02:14:19,886
But what I learned evidently
from bible is 'let us love one another'

1618
02:14:20,678 --> 02:14:26,100
Father, you have time only to roam
around with a foreign woman!

1619
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:33,024
Locals say you would soon
discard the robes!

1620
02:14:33,107 --> 02:14:38,029
Those days locals said the same thing
about Jesus and Mary Magdalene

1621
02:14:38,863 --> 02:14:42,241
It was Lord Jesus Christ
who was crucified

1622
02:14:42,325 --> 02:14:44,160
Not Father Vincent Vattoli!

1623
02:14:45,161 --> 02:14:49,082
So let us not try to taunt
each other on this score!

1624
02:14:49,707 --> 02:14:52,794
You believe, if you close
your eyes, it is night!

1625
02:14:53,252 --> 02:14:57,757
Don't think no one knows the motive
behind the church demolition!

1626
02:14:58,883 --> 02:15:03,096
For certain deeds
I follow my own style!

1627
02:15:04,013 --> 02:15:08,935
I will do what is required
to make others also think in those lines!

1628
02:15:09,143 --> 02:15:11,562
You are not the congregation!

1629
02:15:11,896 --> 02:15:15,399
But I am the vicar of
the Kumarangiri church!

1630
02:15:15,858 --> 02:15:20,113
Whether it is demolition of church
or dissolving the band...

1631
02:15:20,154 --> 02:15:25,910
...or Shoshanna's marriage with Solomon
it is I who take the final decision!

1632
02:15:27,578 --> 02:15:33,918
On top of that is the saint
who protects the church and Lord Jesus!

1633
02:15:34,293 --> 02:15:36,671
They will also have
made some decisions!

1634
02:15:38,881 --> 02:15:40,800
Father! Have a cup of coffee!

1635
02:15:41,425 --> 02:15:43,136
The competition is about to start!

1636
02:15:49,392 --> 02:15:50,393
No thanks, Father!

1637
02:15:50,601 --> 02:15:52,854
Will have coffee after the competition!

1638
02:15:54,605 --> 02:15:58,442
L...l will stay here!

1639
02:15:59,026 --> 02:16:05,408
Me and the saint
want to hear you play and win!

1640
02:16:06,117 --> 02:16:07,326
Chali!

1641
02:16:27,722 --> 02:16:31,559
Dear friends!
The exciting contest is about to start!

1642
02:16:31,642 --> 02:16:36,647
The two teams are ready
like war horses!

1643
02:16:36,731 --> 02:16:39,483
I read your letter
kept inside the rafter!

1644
02:16:40,818 --> 02:16:43,821
Try to play well and win!
I will give you a reply then!

1645
02:16:47,909 --> 02:16:53,581
Clap your hands and encourage them!
Yes clap like that!

1646
02:16:56,167 --> 02:16:58,836
Competition is going to start!

1647
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:05,718
Dear friends! We welcome you all
to witness this competition!

1648
02:17:10,848 --> 02:17:15,770
Dear friends! The exciting contest
is about to start!

1649
02:17:15,853 --> 02:17:20,107
We invite both teams to the stage!

1650
02:17:36,207 --> 02:17:40,127
Both teams have occupied the dais!

1651
02:17:40,211 --> 02:17:44,465
Both teams are charged up
electrifying competition!

1652
02:17:44,507 --> 02:17:49,220
Few minutes from now
the competition starts!

1653
02:17:49,303 --> 02:17:52,139
Come on clap!
Come on

1654
02:17:52,890 --> 02:17:58,062
Play soft where required
and loud where required!

1655
02:17:58,145 --> 02:18:04,527
The clarinet now in your hand
will decide whether you should live or not!

1656
02:18:05,069 --> 02:18:08,990
A sobbing person
with prayers is sitting inside!

1657
02:18:09,073 --> 02:18:10,366
Don't forget that!

1658
02:18:12,326 --> 02:18:16,706
Did you not hear how he played
the third tempo yesterday!

1659
02:18:17,039 --> 02:18:21,168
Is he the guy who is going to
defeat me and win the trophy?

1660
02:18:22,461 --> 02:18:25,339
Today he would poop while playing!

1661
02:20:02,395 --> 02:20:08,609
"It is a prayer to Saint Gee Varghese"

1662
02:22:03,390 --> 02:22:05,142
"Challenge or defiance!"

1663
02:22:05,226 --> 02:22:07,394
"Even if we die
we would not give up!"

1664
02:22:07,478 --> 02:22:09,146
"Challenge or defiance!"

1665
02:22:09,230 --> 02:22:11,398
"Even if we die
we would not give up!"

1666
02:22:11,482 --> 02:22:15,402
"Defeat stares you!
But putting up a brave face!"

1667
02:22:15,486 --> 02:22:19,323
"Defeat stares you!
But putting up a brave face!"

1668
02:22:19,406 --> 02:22:25,955
"Challenge or defiance!"

1669
02:22:27,331 --> 02:22:33,629
"Death or defeat...!"

1670
02:26:46,048 --> 02:26:50,093
I don't know about
the decision of the judges!

1671
02:26:50,302 --> 02:26:52,638
But I know about one thing!

1672
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:58,519
I can't play better than this!

1673
02:28:42,539 --> 02:28:45,542
'Perhaps he did not want to
witness the church demolition!'

1674
02:28:45,709 --> 02:28:48,295
'So he left us earlier!'

1675
02:29:09,191 --> 02:29:11,193
- Philipose!
- What is it, Father?

1676
02:29:13,111 --> 02:29:14,363
Solomon! You proceed!

1677
02:29:16,406 --> 02:29:19,576
Should we not take
a decision on this?

1678
02:29:19,618 --> 02:29:20,535
About what?

1679
02:29:21,203 --> 02:29:23,205
You made a promise!

1680
02:29:23,246 --> 02:29:25,332
If Solomon wins the competition...

1681
02:29:25,415 --> 02:29:28,210
You mean that one...!

1682
02:29:29,211 --> 02:29:34,216
Me making a promise on street
and he winning the trophy is all true

1683
02:29:34,257 --> 02:29:36,218
But how can I give
my daughter to him?

1684
02:29:36,259 --> 02:29:38,512
Is this a child's play, Father?

1685
02:29:39,721 --> 02:29:41,431
I can consider about it...

1686
02:29:41,515 --> 02:29:47,437
...if the guy who played the bet with me
who is in grave or the saint tells me

1687
02:29:48,271 --> 02:29:54,861
As I decided earlier, my daughter
would marry Davis's nephew

1688
02:29:54,945 --> 02:29:56,154
Is it not Davis?

1689
02:29:56,238 --> 02:29:59,866
If that is to happen my dad
should not be Thommeri Kochu Pappan

1690
02:29:59,950 --> 02:30:02,244
if you are manly honor your words!

1691
02:30:02,285 --> 02:30:05,539
For idiotic acts like this
don't expect my support!

1692
02:30:07,249 --> 02:30:11,628
After the first mass and
first consecration of the new church...

1693
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:14,881
...the first wedding at the new church
will be my daughter's

1694
02:30:14,965 --> 02:30:20,303
We will invite all and sundry!
Come and enjoy the free feast!

1695
02:30:21,263 --> 02:30:22,180
Go guys!

1696
02:30:23,306 --> 02:30:24,307
Come Matha!

1697
02:30:25,308 --> 02:30:26,268
Move away!

1698
02:30:56,214 --> 02:30:58,008
First remove the saint!

1699
02:30:58,091 --> 02:30:59,760
Then do the rest!

1700
02:31:38,256 --> 02:31:42,803
'Kumarangiri rained
for one full day and night!'

1701
02:31:42,886 --> 02:31:46,056
'Along with that
3 great things happened!'

1702
02:31:46,598 --> 02:31:52,479
'Father Ottplakan had a dream that
the church need not be demolished'

1703
02:31:52,562 --> 02:31:57,275
'Contractor Philipose understood Shoshanna
is destined to be Solomon's wife!'

1704
02:31:57,651 --> 02:32:03,657
'Sacristan Ouseph decides to return
Esthapan's house document to them!'

1705
02:32:03,740 --> 02:32:06,284
'Without much delay
with locals as witness'

1706
02:32:08,078 --> 02:32:15,919
'Shoshanna and Solomon got married
at the Kumarangiri church!'

1707
02:32:17,003 --> 02:32:20,090
'After few weeks,
there were rain laden clouds!'

1708
02:32:20,173 --> 02:32:23,301
'Moist wind was blowing on that day'

1709
02:32:23,677 --> 02:32:28,765
'That day Gee Varghese band
