1
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:28,224
Everyone knows how to tease.

2
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:34,069
Everyone knows how to crush.

3
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:37,109
You need a heart of steel to clash..

4
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:40,078
You need a heart of steel to clash..

5
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,842
lf anyone attacks from front.

6
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,976
There will be no
time to reload the gun.

7
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:48,782
lf anyone attacks from front.

8
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:51,949
There will be no
time to reload the gun.

9
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:54,789
lf anyone attacks from front.

10
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:58,387
There will be no
time to reload the gun.

11
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:14,142
Many have their weapon
still in their hands.

12
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:20,018
Hit them with a blade.

13
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:24,382
Many have their weapon
still in their hands.

14
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:27,426
Hit them with a blade.

15
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:30,395
Was used by others for long.

16
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:33,364
Was used by others for long.

17
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:36,197
lf anyone attacks from front.

18
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:39,329
There will be no
time to reload the gun.

19
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,033
lf anyone attacks from front.

20
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:45,202
There will be no
time to reload the gun.

21
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:48,076
lf anyone attacks from front.

22
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:51,709
There will be no
time to reload the gun.

23
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:01,785
Hail the Lord.

24
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:06,265
All the villagers are being
informed that today at 7 o'clock..

25
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:09,665
..the complaints against
Fiat Nihaal Singh will be heard.

26
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:16,073
Anyone who has a complaint
can bring it there at 7o'clock.

27
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:18,368
Headman, now this is too much.

28
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:21,174
Your son has troubled us too much.

29
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:26,914
Headman, till date we have
not feared anyone so much..

30
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:29,148
..as much as we fear her son Nihaal.
- Yes.

31
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:32,555
First of all tell me,
what has my son done.

32
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,059
This is a limit, sister.

33
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:36,459
He has troubled the whole village..

34
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,589
..and you are asking,
what has your son done.

35
00:03:38,698 --> 00:03:42,794
Aunt, listen to me, your son
has lied and broken my wedding.

36
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:44,632
He tells everyone that l abuse people.

37
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:47,901
Tell me, do l ever
swear at any rascal.

38
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:51,068
With such difficulty someone
agreed to get his girl married to me.

39
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,735
With great difficulty we
found a girl for him..

40
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,474
..otherwise at this age
where will we get a girl for him.

41
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:57,608
lt is all your fault.

42
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:00,811
What a useless son you
have given birth to.

43
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:02,852
Aunt, even l live in this village.

44
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:04,720
Have you ever heard
anyone complaining about me?

45
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:06,519
Son, you are educated.

46
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,958
He is uneducated like his mother.

47
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:12,260
His poor father died for
the welfare of the village.

48
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:16,699
The son has disgraced his
name instead of respecting it.

49
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,238
Sister, don't say such things.

50
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:21,797
l have got him after a lot of prayers.

51
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,604
Did you pray for him or cursed?

52
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:29,204
Headman, before there is any
more loss to the village..

53
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:31,716
..we should banish him
from the village. - Yes, yes.

54
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:34,184
Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

55
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:37,246
Yes, yes.
- One minute.

56
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:42,191
Sister, keeping in
mind your late husband..

57
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,389
..l will give you another chance.

58
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,733
lf your son troubles the villagers..

59
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:51,804
..then l will not be able to help you.

60
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:56,734
We are not with you in
happiness or sorrow.

61
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,835
Remember, that after this no one
will come or go to your house.

62
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:02,471
Anyway, when will we
come to your house?

63
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:04,608
Your son will get
married only when someone..

64
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:06,117
..will agree to get their
daughter married to him.

65
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:11,123
ls it fine, villagers?
Everyone agrees? - Yes, absolutely.

66
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,134
These villagers have
troubled us so much.

67
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:25,433
Everyday they call
mother to the Village Council.

68
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,097
And look at their threats!

69
00:05:27,207 --> 00:05:28,799
They say, Don't come to
the marriages we hold.

70
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,036
Tell me, am l hungry for the
sweets at your marriages..

71
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:33,545
..that l will come to
your marriages. Taari..

72
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:39,217
You rascal, you love
the laptop more than me?

73
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:42,851
All the time you keep
looking at these pictures.

74
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:44,253
lf you are so desperate, get married.

75
00:05:44,324 --> 00:05:46,019
Who will get his daughter
married to him? - Really?

76
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:50,028
Absolutely right. Who will
get his daughter married to me?

77
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:53,725
Listen, talk to your father.
Maybe he will give me his daughter.

78
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,028
Don't go till my house!

79
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:57,661
How will he go to your house,
he does not go to his own house.

80
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,999
All the time he is sitting here.

81
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:00,164
What nonsense are you guys talking?

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,071
The Headman is going to
banish me from the village.

83
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:03,370
And you guys are
sitting here having drinks.

84
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,171
Find some solution.

85
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:07,370
You have a solution in your hands.

86
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,471
The Headman will go to a parrot.

87
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,517
The parrot's name is Sapna.

88
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,449
She is the only niece of the Headman.

89
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,317
The Headman loves her so much..

90
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:18,619
..as much as the people of
Rajasthan love a water tap.

91
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,216
lf you can set up with her..

92
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:22,056
Whatever you say, Sapna will do..

93
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,823
..whatever Sapna will say,
the Headman will do.

94
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:27,526
This means directly who
is come into your hand..?

95
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:29,295
Headman.

96
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:33,705
Now l have only one dream..

97
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:35,336
Sapna.

98
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:39,902
Goes walking early in the morning.

99
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:45,974
A thorn has pierced
your leg. Take care.

100
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,649
Poor thing is going around in a cycle.

101
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:52,988
You push the pedal of the tractor.

102
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,458
What will happen to that?

103
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,459
Hello Ms. Sapna.
- Hello, Nihaal.

104
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:08,335
What happened, Sapna?

105
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:10,238
Something wrong with the chain?
- No.

106
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,108
The pedal of the cycle was loose,
l thought it may come off.

107
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:14,805
Really? No problem.

108
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,711
Come l will drop you on my motor bike.

109
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:18,215
Will you sit on my bike?

110
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:20,912
Yes, sure. Will you allow me to sit?

111
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:22,852
Since childhood l had this dream..

112
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,356
..that l make Sapna sit on my bike..

113
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:28,826
..and take her around and around.

114
00:07:28,895 --> 00:07:31,523
And ourjourney should never get over.

115
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:34,532
Oh gosh! You talk so sweetly, Nihaal.

116
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:35,692
Let it be.

117
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:37,599
What is in this bag?

118
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,403
l have brought 800
gms of okra for you.

119
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:49,377
l specially told the vegetable
vendor, and got him to add coriander.

120
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:53,375
Why 800 gms? Why not 1 kg?

121
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:55,819
l cannot carry so much on my bike.

122
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:58,249
Come, sit.

123
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:01,293
l hope you won't take undue
advantage of me on the way.

124
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:04,296
Oh gracious me, what confidence!
- What do you mean?

125
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,491
Your uncle is the
Headman of the village.

126
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:10,035
How can l even think of such a thing?

127
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:11,228
Don't worry about that.

128
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:12,931
l will handle uncle myself.

129
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,566
Really? You will
handle your uncle, isn't it?

130
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:20,443
Yes, but l hope you won't
change like the weather.

131
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:23,949
Change like the weather.. never.

132
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:26,315
Everything is
happening so fast, isn't it?

133
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,216
l just don't believe it.

134
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,757
l don't believe it myself,
that all this is happening.

135
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:34,259
Come sit on my bike.

136
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:40,388
Come sit on my bike,
when you are free.

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,001
The neighboring Headman's
daughter eloped and got married.

138
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:52,237
You take care of your daughter.

139
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:57,009
l feel like getting married,
my mother does not agree.

140
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,550
Uncle!

141
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:02,487
Okra? Where did you bring these from?

142
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:05,285
This is auspicious okra gift for me.

143
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,985
Auspicious okra gift?

144
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,924
How do l explain to you?

145
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:11,496
Now you make
arrangements for sending me off.

146
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,059
Where are you going, dear?

147
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:17,534
l and Nihaal have
decided to get married, uncle.

148
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:21,102
Our Nihaal?
- The Fiat Nihaal.

149
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:23,669
Have you gone crazy?

150
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:26,643
No one will give that
rascal a glass of water..

151
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:28,738
..and l should give
away my daughter to him?

152
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:31,648
Uncle, l don't want to
hear one word about my Nihaal.

153
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:37,054
Really? His own uncles
don't ever say 'our' Nihaal..

154
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,623
..how did he become 'your' Nihaal?

155
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,716
l don't want to hear
one word about him.

156
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:42,852
Enough, uncle. l don't
want to hear any more.

157
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:44,294
Otherwise l will do something.

158
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:45,887
What will you do?

159
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,125
What will you do?

160
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,394
Tell me, what will you do?

161
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:52,630
Acting smart! Dare you back answer me!

162
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:54,070
Don't talk nonsense.

163
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:57,506
Uncle, if l was your own daughter,
would you do the same?

164
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,478
l am a stranger!
- Look at this! Dear!

165
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:03,473
Explain to her.

166
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:07,781
Don't be stubborn. You know,
she will not agree.

167
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:10,788
And after marriage,
the boy will improve.

168
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:15,055
Consider one thing, the boy is
the owner of such huge property.

169
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:18,858
She is a child. What has
happened to your brains?

170
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,090
lf the villagers come to
know that l am proposing to..

171
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,760
..Nihaal for my daughter..

172
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:28,000
..the respect with which they
made me sit on the Headman's chair..

173
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,304
..the same respect they will show..

174
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:33,470
..in throwing me down
from the Headman's chair.

175
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,181
How will l go there?

176
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,243
We are blessed. You
have come to our house?

177
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:44,721
Sister, l wanted to talk
to you about something.

178
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:49,561
Why are you looking here and there?

179
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:52,756
The matter is such. No
one should hear about it.

180
00:10:53,967 --> 00:10:58,267
We have come to propose our
Sapna's proposal for your son Nihaal.

181
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:01,737
l didn't understand.
- Even l did not understand.

182
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:05,844
However useless Nihaal is..

183
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:07,573
..but he is a nice boy.

184
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,911
We were blind that
we could not see that.

185
00:11:11,017 --> 00:11:16,922
We have decided that we will get
our Sapna married to your Nihaal.

186
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:18,615
You start making
preparations for the wedding.

187
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:20,989
Let me ask Nihaal first.

188
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:26,225
Nihaal and l have decided that
we will go so far away in life..

189
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,166
..that the journey of
this life will never end.

190
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,596
l will always make okra for him and..

191
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:34,901
..he will pluck radish
for me from the fields.

192
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:36,999
She has brought a
complaint against me.

193
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,505
Headman, l did not tease her.

194
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:43,241
Her cycle pedal was spoilt,
l just gave her a lift. Ask her.

195
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:45,113
Nihaal, what nonsense are you talking?

196
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:46,276
Come with me.

197
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:48,286
l have not come here to complain.

198
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:50,788
But whoever has come to our
house has always come to complain.

199
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:53,519
Uncle has come here
with a marriage proposal.

200
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,719
Our marriage proposal?
- Yes.

201
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:59,832
Headman, l request you, give
us the boycott punishment.

202
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:01,559
Nobody come or go to our house.

203
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:04,762
But don't give us
such a big punishment.

204
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:07,937
Nihaal, you had said, you want
to spend your entire life with me.

205
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:09,941
You want to eat okra made by me too.

206
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:11,670
By that you considered that we marry?

207
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:13,336
Crazy girl, no one
stuffs okra so fast nowadays..

208
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:14,936
..and you want to marry so soon?

209
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:16,811
Listen to me.

210
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,447
Look..

211
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:22,013
..you are like my elder sister.
- Nihaal!

212
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:25,013
Listen to me, l will not marry you.

213
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:26,786
But what is wrong with me?

214
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:29,384
Nothing is wrong, you
only weigh 35-40 kgs extra.

215
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:32,295
Listen to one thing, l said,
this marriage can't take place.

216
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:33,957
But why can't it take place?

217
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:40,964
l love someone else.

218
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:42,234
Say that this is a lie!

219
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,037
How can l say, it's a lie?

220
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:47,971
That girl is my God. My true love.

221
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:49,639
l cannot be someone else's.

222
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:53,048
This body which is pure
like gold is already hers.

223
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,019
Who is she? Tell me.

224
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,953
Who took away this body
which is like pure gold?

225
00:12:57,056 --> 00:12:59,581
Who is it? Tell me, who is she?

226
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:03,653
The girl will die if l
tell you. Am l crazy?

227
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:06,163
What nonsense is this?
lf you didn't want to..

228
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,096
..marry my daughter then
why did you entice her?

229
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,601
l was scared of your
punishment and took advantage of her.

230
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,571
You.. you are taking
advantage of my girl?

231
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:16,631
Why didn't l die before hearing this?
- Dear..

232
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,837
Dear, listen..

233
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,842
lf anything happens to my niece..

234
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:27,244
..l will not spare you.

235
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:33,481
Son, tell me the truth,
is there any other girl?

236
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:35,788
No mother.

237
00:13:35,862 --> 00:13:38,422
lf that's the case
then get married to Sapna.

238
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,260
The girl is not bad.
- Really?

239
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,267
She is not bad she is strong.

240
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,269
lf anyone talks to
me about this again..

241
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,066
..l will climb on the
tank and jump from there.

242
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,573
See, today our
village will be blessed.

243
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:50,472
Today she will jump from the tank.

244
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:52,374
Dear, come down.

245
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:53,810
Dear, don't do that.

246
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,079
Uncle, l will jump from here, if
you don't get me married to Nihaal.

247
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:01,682
Headman, is he our Fiat Nihaal?

248
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:04,314
She wants to get
married to him? Shame!

249
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,292
Shut up. lt's not my fault.
He has spoilt her head.

250
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,828
l am coming, uncle.

251
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:12,694
No, dear, no. For the
sake of God, don't jump.

252
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,733
Stop, dear, stop.

253
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,791
That was Dharmendra who
gave the threat ofjumping..

254
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,962
..from the tank and he
got married to Hema.

255
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:20,868
Nobody will marry you.

256
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,970
Villagers, l am coming.

257
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:26,272
One..

258
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:28,807
Two, three.

259
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:30,940
Let it be, dear.

260
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:34,475
lt will be difficult for us to
collect your pieces from here.

261
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:35,885
Shut up.

262
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,650
Dear, you come down. l will
get you married to Nihaal.

263
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,749
But he said, there is
another girl in his life.

264
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,297
No, dear, crazy girls like you
are not available nowadays..

265
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:49,164
..who fall in love with a
guy like Nihaal. Come down.

266
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,661
Sir, you say something.

267
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:56,799
Absolutely. He will have
to get married to you.

268
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:59,241
Yes.
- Come down. - Come down.

269
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,940
Dear, l will get you
married to Nihaal. Come down.

270
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:04,949
For the sake of God,
come down. Come down.

271
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:07,815
Come, we will go to Nihaal's
house and talk to his mother.

272
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,218
Come, come.
- Come.

273
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:11,813
Everyone come.

274
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,019
You rascal whenever
you have given advice..

275
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:15,458
..its been bad advice.

276
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:18,088
And l am a fool who
listens to your advice.

277
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:20,688
And the head of fools, the
Headman of the village..

278
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,961
..who brought the proposal
of his drum like daughter..

279
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:24,661
..for a handsome guy like me.

280
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:26,762
l am surprised. Who will marry her?

281
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:28,237
She is so huge.

282
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:29,569
Wow!

283
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:34,708
Wow!
- Hold it. Don't look here.

284
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:39,275
Taari, what do you
get by printing these..

285
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:41,081
..innocent girls photos from Google.

286
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:44,316
After printing 5-7 such
photos and keeping in the pocket..

287
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,823
..a person's confidence increases.

288
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:50,453
Do one thing, print 2-3 for me too.
- Why?

289
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,027
l like her.

290
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:53,622
And my confidence will also increase.

291
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,462
And one more thing.

292
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,627
Don't print for yourself.
- Why?

293
00:15:57,737 --> 00:16:00,706
She is my personal. Raveena Tandon.

294
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:02,865
Push the button.

295
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:05,410
What nonsense is this!

296
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:07,240
He makes each one his personal.

297
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:09,474
Come on everyone.

298
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,825
Taari, we have not done anything..

299
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,587
..where are these
villagers heading to?

300
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:23,628
Come on.

301
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:29,425
They are not going anywhere.
They are coming to your house.

302
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,430
Come on.

303
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:33,562
Dear, don't worry.

304
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,606
l will.. come on.

305
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:47,950
Tell me.. What sort of boy he is?

306
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:50,522
He should atleast
consider his widow mother.

307
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:53,558
What happened?
- Don't you know what happened?

308
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:56,288
Sister, the whole village
has decided that Nihaal..

309
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:58,489
..will have to get
married to my niece.

310
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:00,429
Only we know how we have
brought her down from the tank.

311
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:01,898
Look at her state.

312
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:04,959
l beg of you, now
you all go from here.

313
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:06,402
l will explain to my son.

314
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:07,802
ls this ajoke?

315
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:11,274
lf we have come, we
will talk and then leave.

316
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:14,010
Move aside. Strange.

317
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,140
Mother, this is great.

318
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:19,707
Today all these people
have come to our house.

319
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:22,379
All of them and also the Headman.

320
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:23,752
Have you invited them for a meal?

321
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:25,289
See how innocent they are acting.

322
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:26,450
As if they don't know anything.

323
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:29,358
Talk nicely, uncle. He
is your future son-in-law.

324
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:30,895
Shut up.

325
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:32,793
She has considered you her husband.

326
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,025
Now tell me what to do?

327
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,160
Listen, l have told you earlier,
l will not marry her.

328
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:39,203
l am set somewhere else. What say?

329
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:40,431
Yes. Yes.

330
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:43,373
l will marry that girl.
- Son, why are you lying?

331
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,774
l know everything, there
is no such setting anywhere.

332
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:47,971
Aunt, you know a lot about setting.

333
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:51,141
ln 1965, were you set somewhere?

334
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:56,013
l don't know about that
but l know he is lying.

335
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:57,555
Why will l lie?

336
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:59,352
As if my non-medical was kept..

337
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:01,154
..that l did not get
the time to do setting.

338
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:03,991
Listen to me all of you,
get lost from here..

339
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:06,155
..don't talk nonsense
in front of my mother.

340
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:07,493
Why not?

341
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,329
Tell us, who is she?

342
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:12,132
Who is she?
- What work does she do?

343
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:14,866
She works in films.
Rani Mukherjee. Tell me.

344
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,805
There is no match
between you and Rani Mukherjee.

345
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:18,137
And your horoscopes also don't meet.

346
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,438
She is a Bengali and
you are a Punjabi.

347
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:21,446
Rascals, you all
don't let lndia unite.

348
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:24,312
You come up with caste and
creed before everything.

349
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:26,009
Catch him!

350
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:29,286
Why are you interfering?
- Don't try to act too smart.

351
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:31,220
Get married to my niece.

352
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:35,885
Son, if there is no girl,
then why are you lying?

353
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,360
There is, mother.

354
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:39,496
There is.

355
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,394
Tell them there is.

Wait a minute.

358
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,877
We will show the girl.

359
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:54,306
Take this.

360
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,519
Whose photo did you show?
- lt's the Canada one, l think.

361
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:06,716
lf you are having an affair with her,
then why is the photo with him?

362
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:08,259
lt is to be framed.

363
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:12,787
Yes. lt is my sister-in-law's photo.
l have to frame it.

364
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:15,095
What is in the photo that
you want to get it framed?

365
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,566
You have a lot of experience in that..

366
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,398
..do you go often to click your photo?

367
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:22,497
Keep quiet? Nihaal,
make her talk to us.

368
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,873
Make some excuse.
- Keep quiet.

369
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:26,844
l will make her talk to you, aunt.

370
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,641
She will have a long
conversation with you.

371
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:30,739
When? Have her speak to us now.

372
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,977
How can she speak now?
She lives in Canada.

373
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:34,314
She speaks in English.

374
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:36,581
She will ramble off in English.

375
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:37,815
Does anyone know English?

376
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,358
The villagers are come together!
Village Department.

377
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:43,918
Even you don't know English,
how do you speak to her?

378
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:45,588
Have you ever fallen in love, brother?

379
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:47,689
lf you had, you would have known.

380
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:49,461
There is a language of love too.

381
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:52,936
Love is done from here.
From the heart.

382
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,063
With emotions!

383
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:57,939
Hail Revolution.. -.
Control your emotions, Taari.

384
00:19:58,477 --> 00:20:00,138
Listen, Nihaal.

385
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,478
Listen..

386
00:20:08,454 --> 00:20:12,288
..now you will not insult me
in front of the whole village.

387
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:15,788
lf you have a love
affair with this girl, then..

388
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:19,763
..in one month, you
have to bring her here.

389
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:23,326
Otherwise quietly get
married to my niece Sapna.

390
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:26,729
And the whole village is the witness.

391
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:30,070
ls that fine?
- Yes, absolutely.

392
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:32,633
Son, is it fine with you?

393
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:38,279
Yes.

394
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,945
Come on.
- Come on.

395
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,216
Let's see what he does.

396
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:51,724
Come.

397
00:20:57,336 --> 00:20:59,804
Like mother, like son.

398
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:04,366
Both of you have disgraced all of us.

399
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:21,119
Thank God mother is asleep.

400
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:24,093
Otherwise all my
intoxication would be washed away.

401
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:44,411
Nihaal.
- Yes, mother.

402
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,679
What else will you hide from me?

403
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:52,953
Mother, Taari's relatives had come.

404
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:56,289
Taari did not have to
drink so he forced me to drink.

405
00:21:56,362 --> 00:21:58,796
Son, you lie at every instance.

406
00:21:58,897 --> 00:22:01,388
How many more lies will you tell me?

407
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:05,062
ls there any girl in your life?
Tell me the truth, son.

408
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:08,936
Mother, you don't trust me?
- No, l don't.

409
00:22:09,742 --> 00:22:13,439
What sort of a life is mine,
whose mother has no trust in him?

410
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:17,039
l will go and bring the girl
tomorrow and show her to you first.

411
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:19,117
l will show the villagers later.

412
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:22,112
Will you remember all this
when you get up in the morning?

413
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:25,884
Otherwise all the villagers
will kill me with their taunts.

414
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:28,357
l will remember, you
please go to sleep.

415
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:31,892
Keep your hand on the head.
- Here, mother.

416
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,859
Not yours, mine.
- Here.

417
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,195
ls it fine?

418
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:39,795
Take an oath that you will
bring the girl tomorrow.

419
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:46,205
l will bring her, you go to sleep.

420
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:56,220
Hail to the Lord.

421
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:57,846
Victory to the Lord.

422
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:00,288
All the villagers are being informed..

423
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:03,453
..that everyone should
reach Nihaal's house.

424
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:07,692
His mother wants to tell
everyone that her son is not a liar.

425
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,291
He is going to Canada to
get her daughter-in-law.

426
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:12,132
Nihaal has done an amazing thing.

427
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:15,469
Will Nihaal bring a wife
for himself from Canada?

428
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:16,769
Let it be.

429
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:17,866
He just talks.

430
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:20,434
His wife will come and
only touch our feet.

431
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:23,447
Let's talk about eating sweets.
- What have we got to do?

432
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:27,709
ls Nihaal just telling lies
or will he bring the girl?

433
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:30,653
Sister, Nihaal will
surely bring the girl.

434
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:33,658
Last night, he has sworn by me.

435
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,590
l pray to God, what you say is true.

436
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:43,591
Nihaal, you are awake? Good morning.

437
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:48,802
Son, tell them.. who
considered me a liar along with you..

438
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:50,966
..that you will
bring my daughter-in-law.

439
00:23:51,877 --> 00:23:55,108
Oh gosh, wonder why the villagers
take everything l say seriously.

440
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,479
Son, why are you quiet? Tell them.

441
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,745
That you will surely
bring my daughter-in-law.

442
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:02,719
Tell us. Say something.
- Say something.

443
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:07,952
lt's the limit.
- Why are you quiet now?

444
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,891
Yes, l will bring her.

445
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:13,863
Did you all hear? My son will
surely bring my daughter-in-law.

446
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:19,165
Go and tell the Headman, to look
for another boy for his niece.

447
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:21,762
Long live, my son. Long live.

448
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,434
She kills me herself and
then says, Long live.

449
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:27,107
Taari, where are you, you rascal.

450
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:30,538
Rascal, you did not
find any girl nearby?

451
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:34,677
lf we look at any girl nearby,
the villagers will kill us.

452
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,584
Think far.. Think far..

453
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:38,088
First of all l have sworn by mother.

454
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,317
On top of that you have shown
such a photo to the villagers..

455
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:42,053
..whom we don't know at all.

456
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:43,958
Now what are you doing here?

457
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:45,587
Look for the girl. Girl. Jasneet.

458
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:46,892

459
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:52,362
Here.. JASNEET. Jasneet.

One E and T here it is.

461
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:58,574
We are deceived.

462
00:24:58,677 --> 00:24:59,769
All are males.

463
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:01,846
Don't put Singh, put Kaur.

464
00:25:02,581 --> 00:25:06,210
Here you are.. KAUR.

465
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:11,615
Got it.

466
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,515
Here is your sister-in-law.

Fire-cracker!
- Hey!

476
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,572
She likes to burn in Diwali.
lt's written there.

477
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:36,239
But Taari, how will l go to Canada?

478
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:38,215
By sailing in a tube in the sea.
- What?

479
00:25:38,283 --> 00:25:40,251
l know many agents here.

480
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,082
When will they come of any use?

481
00:25:42,154 --> 00:25:43,314
You just collect money.

482
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:44,514
7.5 lakhs.

483
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:45,647

But l have kept that for the Jontier.
- Then go by the Jontier.

00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:52,361
Okay buddy. l have
the money, l will go.

487
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:56,059
Just bring the money and
you will fly in an aeroplane.

488
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:58,593
Jasneet Kaur.

489
00:26:00,138 --> 00:26:01,605
Nihaal Singh is coming.

490
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:04,137

- Hail to her.

491
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:06,074

Aunt from Canada.
- Hail to her.

494
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:12,109
Aunt from Canada.

495
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:17,018
What is this nonsense? Useless people.

496
00:26:17,122 --> 00:26:17,747
They come together.

497
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:18,914
What's happening?

498
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:21,785
Strange.

499
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:23,088
Look at him.

500
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:24,093
Look at him.

501
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:25,789
This is the visa to Canada.

502
00:26:27,499 --> 00:26:28,898
Enough. You want to erase the visa?

503
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:32,027
Headman, l hope you are happy to
know that the Jatt is off to Canada..

504
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:34,937
..to get the
daughter-in-law of the village.

505
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:35,598
Not the
daughter-in-law of the village.

506
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:37,005
The daughter-in-law of the house.

507
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:38,736
l mean the
daughter-in-law of the house.

508
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:41,176
Son, there is still time,
if you listen to me..

509
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,544
..ask the villagers for forgiveness.

510
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:46,482
The whole village will have to
ask for forgiveness from me.

511
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:51,045
They will say, Nihaal Singh,
you were right and we were wrong.

512
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:53,751
Your stars foretell
a bad period of time.

513
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:56,123
From where will you get a girl?
Your Saturn is sitting down.

514
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:58,219
Why is it sitting down?
Can't it sit on top?

515
00:26:58,297 --> 00:27:00,231
l have just changed the sofa covers.

516
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:05,599
And you Mr. Anmol Singh. Listen, l go
Canada and bring your sister-in-law.

517
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:10,535
And you priest, if l don't
bring you down to your knees..

518
00:27:10,609 --> 00:27:12,201
..change my name.

519
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,573
You should not talk
like that to a priest.

520
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:14,577
You will be burnt to ashes here.

521
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,272
l will beat you in front
of the Village Council.

522
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:19,010
Come on, Taari, lets go.

523
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:20,517
'Now make the preparations.'

524
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:21,916
'The Jatt will leave.'

525
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:24,046
'Don't threaten us.'

526
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:28,183
'Make way..'

527
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:33,188
lt's the sunshine in the moonlight.

528
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:35,961
Mr. Nihaal Singh, welcome to Canada.

529
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:37,797
Hey, there is so
much cleanliness here.

530
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:40,337
This looks like the flag of Canada.

531
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:42,873
lt is so crowded also. But so strange.

532
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:46,342
ln so many fair foreigners,
where will l find my madam?

533
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:49,972
l mean to say, my
Google one.. Jasneet Kaur.

534
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:52,414
My dear, come before me.

535
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:12,634
Uncle, remember one thing.. today
you will return after you leave me..

536
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:15,400
..but after a few days you have
to leave me back at the airport.

537
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:20,502
And at that time l will not go
alone but there will be two of us.

538
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:32,851
'Taari has sent me with
the address of Mr. Tindsa..'

539
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:34,949
'..but Taari is also a liar like me.'

540
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,925
'l hope the address is not wrong.'

541
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,195
Who is this beautiful lady?

542
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:48,266
l hope she is not
Taari's sister or something.

543
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:52,835
Let's talk to her and see.

544
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:55,245
Hello.
- Hello.

545
00:28:55,313 --> 00:28:57,372
ls this Mr. Tindsa's house?
- Yes, it is.

546
00:28:57,482 --> 00:28:58,540
But who are you?

547
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:02,246
Myself Nihaal Singh Grewa, Party
President, Rutuberand College, Nabba.

548
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:04,548
Nabba?

549
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:07,154
There is a lot of fear
for the people of Nabba.

550
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:09,523
Madam, will l meet Mr. Tindsa inside?

551
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:10,356
This is not his house.

552
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:11,760
But you just said, this is his house.

553
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,695
He sold this house to me and left.

554
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:15,824
But where will l go?
- What do l know?

555
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:18,402
l swear.. l am good guy
please let me stay with you.

556
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,335
Are you crazy?
- Please..

557
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:21,702
Hello. Hello.

558
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:22,501
Don't touch me.

559
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:23,700
l am a Judo Karate champion.

560
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:24,799
Understood?
- Really?

561
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,844
Even l am a champion; we
will look for the house later.

562
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,140
Shall we see your Judo Karate first?

563
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:29,305
Please.

564
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:31,372
You will leave? l
will not let you leave.

565
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:33,451
l have not let anyone pass till today.

566
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:35,145
You don't know.

567
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,552
l have not let great men pass by.

568
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:39,351
What are you?

569
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:46,924
Strange! The car is just like her.

570
00:29:47,032 --> 00:29:48,624
She has got the steering
fixed on the wrong side.

571
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,758
Otherwise l would not let her go.

572
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:53,762
Uncle, where are you?

573
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:56,897
Grocery store.

574
00:29:58,076 --> 00:30:00,135
Wow! Wow!

575
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:01,975
Such a big place.

576
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:05,917
This cannot be Taari's uncle's place.

577
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:08,008
He must be working here.

578
00:30:09,454 --> 00:30:11,046
Apple..

579
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:14,587
..they have wrapped
them in blankets and kept.

580
00:30:15,327 --> 00:30:16,351
Wow!

581
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:18,396
Come out from the blanket.

582
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,454
Oh God! He has come here too.

583
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,493
Take this.

584
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,967
Mango, you too enjoy the blanket.

585
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:26,526
Poor thing is weak.

586
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:30,871
l think mama and papa must have
sent him to check on me. Stupid.

587
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:36,038
What is she doing here?

588
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:38,210
Oh my God! He is coming towards me!

589
00:30:38,316 --> 00:30:39,613
Oh my God!

590
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:40,685
What are you doing here?

591
00:30:40,752 --> 00:30:42,617
That is what l am asking..
what are you doing here?

592
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:44,951
This store is mine.
- ls it?

593
00:30:45,056 --> 00:30:47,752
This store is
Taari's uncle's Mr. Tindsa.

594
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:49,691
He sold this store and left.

595
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:51,752
Hey! Does not look like!

596
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,923
You have kept a broken useless car.
And this store is yours?

597
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:56,126
What have you got to do
with my car? Go out from here.

598
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:57,498
Whom did you ask and pick this up?

599
00:30:57,569 --> 00:30:59,366
l have seen many rich people..

600
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:01,268
..but have never seen a rich person..

601
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:02,863
..who grabs an apple
from a hungry person.

602
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:03,930
You don't know who l am.

603
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:06,306
ln the year 1982, my
father had a Fiat car.

604
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:08,812
We were discussing
about buying a Jontier.

605
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,475
We had 18 contracts.

606
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:15,109
l have brought 632 dollars.

607
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:17,546
Acting smart!

608
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:25,263
People fix ltalian marble and keep.

609
00:31:25,363 --> 00:31:29,163
The sights you get in the
fields is totally different.

610
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:31,532
Taari, go ahead.

611
00:31:33,238 --> 00:31:36,765
Oh God! l wonder how people come to..

612
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,399
..know that Taari is
doing some important work.

613
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:40,674
Hello.

614
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:42,212
Taari, what did you do?

615
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:44,714
You gave me the wrong
address of your uncle.

616
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:48,241
The address is right. l just got a
card from uncle on the new year.

617
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,049
l have gone there.

618
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:51,713
No uncle of yours stays there.

619
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:53,017
Did you go to the store?

620
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:54,422
l went to the store also.

621
00:31:54,492 --> 00:31:57,017
Your uncle has sold the
store to some crazy girl.

622
00:31:57,095 --> 00:31:58,892
She threw me out.

623
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:02,092
l don't understand that should
l look for a place to stay..

624
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,598
..or should l look for Jasneet.

625
00:32:03,668 --> 00:32:05,465
You have sent me on an exile.

626
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,537
You are strange.

627
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:08,095
l did so much for you, you
are not appreciating that.

628
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:09,468
l have stood by you.

629
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:11,031
Let it be.

630
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,337
When did you stand by me?

631
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:14,412
Whenever there was a problem,
you would run first.

632
00:32:14,512 --> 00:32:15,274
Stupid.

633
00:32:15,347 --> 00:32:16,974
Did l run deliberately?

634
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:20,017
Sometimes the pressure increases.
You should understand.

635
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:22,144
ls there any use
getting angry with me?

636
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:23,653
Whatever had to happen has happened!

637
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:26,223
Now you do one thing..
look for a Gurudwara near by..

638
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,087
..and go there.

639
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:29,251
Brother, God is always there
for those who have no one.

640
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:34,988
Gurudwara of the foreigners will do?

641
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:56,414
Lord, l wanted to talk to
you about something important.

642
00:32:57,355 --> 00:33:00,153
But l don't
understand which side you are.

643
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:02,953
l will look ahead and talk.

644
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:06,962
Please send a message to my Lord..

645
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:08,994
..that Nihaal has reached Canada..

646
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:10,762
..but is facing a small problem.

647
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:12,602
Lord, l will tell you the truth.

648
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,935
What is there to hide from you?
You know the whole matter.

649
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:16,200
But in Canada l have one problem.

650
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:17,605
You know what its like in lndia.

651
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:21,305
With your grace, in the year 1982,
my father had a Fiat car.

652
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:22,880
We had bought it for 1800.

653
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:24,414
We were discussing
about buying a Jontier.

654
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:25,881
That did not happen.

655
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,645
We had 18 contracts.

656
00:33:27,752 --> 00:33:29,777
But God, we have to
think of one thing.

657
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:31,515
Mother can't do everything alone.

658
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:33,454
l have to be there, isn't it?

659
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:37,221
Lord, if you help me,
everything will go smoothly.

660
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:39,957
God, just help me
this time. Thank you.

661
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:41,464
Bye.

662
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:46,928
Lord, there is no
arrangement for the holy 'prasad'..

663
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:48,597
Lord, you must be wondering,
what sort of a guy is he.

664
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:49,901
Lord, l am very hungry.

665
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:51,908
l have not had a cup
of tea since morning.

666
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,104
l had some snacks that were
also removed by the Delhi customs.

667
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,171
l am in a bad state.

668
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,147
You? What are you doing here?

669
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:03,881
Now don't say that Mr.
Tindsa sold this place to you.

670
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:05,216
Okay. Relax.

671
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,087
Hey! No veil on your head.

672
00:34:07,158 --> 00:34:08,022
And you are wearing shoes.

673
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:09,957
l will hit you with a candle.

674
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:11,050
Are you crazy?

675
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:12,289
Okay. This is a Church.

676
00:34:12,397 --> 00:34:13,295
We can come like that.

677
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:14,865
May it be a Church or whatever..

678
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:16,627
..our parents have taught us
that the head should be covered..

679
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:17,895
..and one should not
wear shoes inside.

680
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,870
You have kept your legs naked also.

681
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:22,064
Okay, l am sorry.

682
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:23,731
l made a mistake.
- How did you make a mistake?

683
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:25,503
You don't make any mistake?
- l make a mistake?

684
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:27,442
Yes.
- l make a mistake? - Yes.

685
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,047
l make a mistake..

686
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:34,785
l have made a mistake.

687
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:39,146
l can sit here in the Church, right?
- Of course.

688
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:42,426
l came to Canada on the
say of that crazy fellow.

689
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:44,256
Since morning l have
been looking for uncle..

690
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,628
..where is Mr. Tindsa?
Where is Mr. Tindsa?

691
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:52,093
Mr. Tindsa is there?
- He is?

692
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,502
First tell me, will you have coffee?
- With whom?

693
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:56,039
With me.

694
00:34:56,107 --> 00:35:00,134
Coffee with a girl?
Wow! Lord, you are great!

695
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:02,372
Today l have come to
know how fast Canada is.

696
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:03,675
Just two minutes
back l sent a message..

697
00:35:03,748 --> 00:35:06,216
..you sent it to my Lord so soon.

698
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:07,615
l salute you, Lord.

699
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:09,245
l love you.

700
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:12,446
Strange. You saw some
girl's photo on Facebook..

701
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:14,650
..and you came so far to meet her.

702
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:15,988
l saw the photo of this one.

703
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:19,552
Once or twice l went just like that.
My friends said she is a nice girl.

704
00:35:19,798 --> 00:35:22,892
Hello. She is the
richest girl in this city.

705
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:23,899
Understood?

706
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:25,196
Leave aside two months.

707
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:27,100
Even if you go behind her for two..

708
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:28,332
..lives you will not
be able to do anything.

709
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:29,737
Am l crazy?

710
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:32,276
ln the year 1982, my
father had a Fiat car.

711
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:35,107
You told me.

712
00:35:35,547 --> 00:35:37,310
Now will you take me
to Mr. Tindsa's house..

713
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:38,747
..or will you kill me in the cold.

714
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,976
Shall l tell you something?
- Yeah.

715
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:43,452
That house where we met earlier..
that is uncle Tindsa's house.

716
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:47,387
And that grocery store
also belongs to Mr. Tindsa's.

717
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:49,120
Then why did you lie to me?

718
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:53,728
Actually l am also from Nabba.
- You are from Nabba?

719
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:55,356
Yes.
- Oh gosh.

720
00:35:55,467 --> 00:35:59,403
One minute, listen to me.
- From Nabba.

721
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:03,134
The thing is, two years
back l made a mistake. - What?

722
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:07,408
l used to like a boy on the lnternet.

723
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:09,379
On the lnternet? Then?

724
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:11,347
l came here to get married to him..

725
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:13,417
..against the wishes
of my mama and papa.

726
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:17,252
After coming here, l came to
know that he has deceived me.

727
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:21,085
He says that since you
have left your parents..

728
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:23,491
..means you don't have any property.

729
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:25,256
So l am not interested in you now.

730
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,389
Tell me where he is, l
will teach him a lesson.

731
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:28,796
l don't know where he is.

732
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:33,664
Mom, dad, think that l am
married to him and l am very happy.

733
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:36,871
They always tell me to have
him talk to them on the phone.

734
00:36:36,941 --> 00:36:38,340
To talk to their son-in-law.

735
00:36:38,409 --> 00:36:40,604
But l always avoid it.

736
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:43,203
That's why l got scared, when
you said you are from Nabba.

737
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:46,011
l thought mama and papa
had sent you behind me..

738
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:48,052
..to check on me.

739
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,788
Come on now, will you
kill me in the cold..

740
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:52,686
..or will you
introduce me to Mr. Tindsa.

741
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:54,549
There also there is a problem.

742
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,183
lf the son agrees
the father does not..

743
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:57,751
..and if the father
agrees the son does not.

744
00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:01,891
Nihaal Singh has turned
around the whole village..

745
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,297
..these are only two guys.

746
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,062
Come.

747
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:06,069
Dad, please listen to me. Please.

748
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:07,934
Nooo!

749
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:10,804
l cannot shut my grocery store.

750
00:37:10,909 --> 00:37:14,106
Rack your brains, you donkey.

751
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:15,475
Talk sense.

752
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:18,015
How can l shut down my grocery store?

753
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:19,640
Crazy fellow.

754
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:22,117
Oh God, dad! Who is
telling you to shut it down?

755
00:37:22,186 --> 00:37:23,676
You don't understand what l am saying.

756
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:26,918
l am just saying, in place
of that we will open a club..

757
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:28,151
..where there will be dancing.

758
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:32,753
Donkey, you mean l should close
my store which is 25 years old..

759
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:36,356
..and wear shorts
and dance like Shakira.

760
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:38,425
Oh God, dad! l am
not talking about you.

761
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:40,026
You don't have to dance.

762
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:41,628
Dad, just think.

763
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:43,674
Our Tinsa Grocery store..

764
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:46,266
Not Tinsa.. Tindsa.. Tindsa.

765
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:47,776
Learn to say it properly.

766
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:51,337
Dad, just think, the
location of our grocery store..

767
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:53,350
..there will be a T Club.

768
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:56,714
You will get down from a limousine.

769
00:37:56,821 --> 00:38:00,052
There will be TV
reporters all four sides.

770
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:04,026
There will be beautiful
girls dancing in front of you.

771
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:06,957
The mothers of these
girls will also be there?

772
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:09,659
Oh God, dad! Mothers and
fathers don't come there.

773
00:38:09,734 --> 00:38:10,996
Parents aren't allowed, dad.

774
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:14,061
But l will sit at the
cash counter, isn't it?

775
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:16,231
Dad, there won't be
a cash counter too.

776
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:18,172
Then what will l do
by opening a club..

777
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:20,210
..when there is no
work over there for me.

778
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:22,336
And this is against our culture.

779
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:23,846
Talk sense.

780
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:27,315
Nihaal, l think we have
come at the wrong time.

781
00:38:27,418 --> 00:38:30,854
There is no wrong or
right time for Nihaal.

782
00:38:30,955 --> 00:38:34,049
Taking care of old things is called
culture. - Now watch Nihaal effect.

783
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:37,526
Tomorrow you will say,
these parents have become old..

784
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:38,994
..throw them out.

785
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:42,362
This is your culture?
Shame on your culture.

786
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:44,731
You are absolutely right, uncle.

787
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:46,269
Hold this.

788
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:49,829
lf we forget our roots, we
will fall down. - Absolutely.

789
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:51,374
He is talking sense.

790
00:38:51,442 --> 00:38:53,410
This is the culture
of these foreigners.

791
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,274
They give their children full freedom.

792
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:56,244
That is right.

793
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:58,077
Look, one thing we have to agree.

794
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:00,947
The foreigners don't stick
to their children. - Yes.

795
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:03,180
But if we cut off the
thread of the kite..

796
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:05,119
..it will surely fall on the ground.

797
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:09,353
Wow, uncle! Wow! Wonderful, uncle.

798
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:11,520
l am blessed that l have
got the opportunity to live..

799
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:13,826
..in the house of
such a great man, uncle.

800
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:15,489
You are great! Great!

801
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,092
Enough.. l am not so great.

802
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:21,068
Welcome, this is like your own house.

803
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,766
You can stay here.

804
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:25,599
One minute.. hold this.
- Yes.

805
00:39:26,244 --> 00:39:27,609
l did not recognize you.

806
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:28,576
Who are you?

807
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:30,944
You did not
recognize me, uncle? Strange.

808
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:33,176
l am your Nihaal.

809
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,115
Your tiny Nihaal.

810
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:35,311
Which Nihaal?

811
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,978
Uncle, from the village. From Nabba.

812
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:37,919
Taari's friend.

813
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:39,388
Nihaal Singh Grewa.

814
00:39:39,957 --> 00:39:41,447
l hope Taari has not come.

815
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:43,857
Who will give him a visa for Canada?
Taari is not there.

816
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:44,758
l have come alone.

817
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:46,626
He is a very characterless boy.

818
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:50,030
Just like you! He is not gone on you.

819
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:51,830
Where is Taari and where are you!

820
00:39:51,903 --> 00:39:54,531
What a great
personality you have, uncle.

821
00:39:54,605 --> 00:39:55,629
lt was great!

822
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:57,402
Son, you will live here from today.

823
00:39:57,508 --> 00:40:01,410
From today, my nephew will
stay in this house with us.

824
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,879
There will be no
interference from you.

825
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:06,142
Sorry, uncle. Where is my room?

826
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,582
Go upstairs, on the left, second room.

827
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:10,314
Thank you, uncle. You are great.

828
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:12,356
Did you hear? Take care.

829
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:15,449
Madam, my mother did not keep
my name Nihaal just like that.

830
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:19,018
Wherever l go, l do wonders.

831
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:20,388
Meet you later.

832
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:23,093
No!

833
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:26,601
lt's strange, Nihaal Singh.

834
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:30,774
l tell people my sad story
and they start laughing.

835
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,573
That was enjoyable.

836
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:42,944
That's like a man.

837
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:46,313
When trouble occurred,
you didn't get scared.

838
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:48,984
You took action.
- He did take action.

839
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:51,084
But have you thought about
what you're going to do next?

840
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:54,221
Dear, in such matters, you
shouldn't think about what to do next.

841
00:40:54,332 --> 00:40:55,765
He came here without thinking.

842
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,323
Now without thinking
too much will move ahead.

843
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:59,961
But uncle, at least help me get
a picture clicked with the girl.

844
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:02,266
ln my village, aunt's taunts
must have increased my mother's..

845
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,705
..blood pressure.

846
00:41:03,808 --> 00:41:06,106
She should know that
Nihaal has reached Canada.

847
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:08,111
All right. Let's get
a picture clicked.

848
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:10,443
Father, forget about
getting a picture clicked.

849
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:13,242
First tell me, do you
even know where she lives?

850
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:16,618
You idiot, the whole
world knows where she lives.

851
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:18,483
Read the newspaper sometimes.

852
00:41:18,556 --> 00:41:21,719
She belongs to the
richest family in the city.

853
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:30,531
Uncle, this is the first
time l am waiting for a girl.

854
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:32,836
Am feeling very odd.

855
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:34,363
Wonder when will she come out?

856
00:41:34,472 --> 00:41:37,873
lt's the sunshine in the moonlight.

857
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:41,240
Feeling on my face all bright.

858
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:43,540
Uncle, she is so beautiful.

859
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:44,842
She looks better than the photo

860
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:48,511
My heart is pumping out
with the pace of love.

861
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:51,214
There's a rhythm on my mind.

862
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:52,756
Uncle, usually there's a
firecracker in 'Diwali'..

863
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:55,121
..which we burst right in the end.

864
00:41:55,193 --> 00:42:01,029
lt's equal to all the other
firecrackers. She's that firecracker.

865
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:04,364
Hung up and don't get away.

866
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:08,733
'Oh gosh, it should
be the rainy season.'

867
00:42:09,006 --> 00:42:11,497
'lt should be drizzling.'

868
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:14,975
'The Jatt should be
sitting on the Jontier.'

869
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,977
'And my Raveena Tandon..'

870
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,380
'..wearing an anklet on her left leg.'

871
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:26,055
'Making a lovely sound,
brings something for the Jatt.'

872
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:27,283
lt will be amazing.

873
00:42:27,391 --> 00:42:31,794
But you said, we are still
discussing about buying the Jontier..

874
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,864
Uncle, we are still
discussing about her too.

875
00:42:38,502 --> 00:42:40,697
But who are these
colorful men behind her, uncle?

876
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:42,397
ls her father a minister?

877
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:44,874
Forget about that.

878
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:46,603
We need to get a
picture clicked with her.

879
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:47,905
Come on, sit in the car.

880
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:52,706
Nihaal, this is the
Downtown of Vancouver.

881
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:56,549
What? - Like how we have in the
crossroad village.. this is it.

882
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:57,746
Really?

883
00:42:57,822 --> 00:42:59,016
You didn't understand?
- No.

884
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:02,116
Just like there is
sector 17 in Chandigarh.

885
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:03,490
Assume that this is Sector 17.

886
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:05,426
This means there's a
fountain on the next turn?

887
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,792
There's no fountain here. Just
see the liveliness around you.

888
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:13,494
But l don't see my heroine anywhere.

889
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:15,998
We'll see her somewhere.

890
00:43:23,748 --> 00:43:24,840
She is standing there.

891
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,749
Take a nice picture.
Don't do any foolishness.

892
00:43:27,818 --> 00:43:29,547
Yes, don't worry.

893
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:45,333
Just wait and watch. l'll click
such an amazing picture today..

894
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:46,597
..that you'll praise me.

895
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:48,866
The girl looks so
beautiful in the camera..

896
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,339
Uncle, click.

897
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:53,137
Dear, l will click. At
least let me finish talking.

898
00:43:55,046 --> 00:43:57,537
Just wait and watch what
an amazing picture l take.

899
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:03,918
l clicked. l clicked. l clicked.

900
00:44:06,691 --> 00:44:07,885
Hello.

901
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:09,751
Did you see the picture?
- Uncle, show me.

902
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:11,089
Look.
- lt's very nice.

903
00:44:11,162 --> 00:44:14,256
Uncle, show me. - Look what an
amazing picture l've clicked.

904
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:15,390
What do you think about it?

905
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:17,763
What have you done?
- Why? lt's your picture.

906
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:19,334
You clicked my
picture with the black man.

907
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:22,065
Why do you look at him?
Look at your picture.

908
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:24,573
You look like
Dharmendra when he was young.

909
00:44:24,642 --> 00:44:26,166
Now do you believe how
talented your uncle is?

910
00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:27,403
Where is the girl?

911
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:30,942
Why do you worry? Your
picture will be clicked.

912
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:32,675
You'll click my picture
only when the girl is found.

913
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:34,273
We will find the girl...

914
00:44:35,453 --> 00:44:37,318
She's standing there.

915
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:38,849
Get the car please.

916
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:42,518
Now you click my picture.
- Okay done.

917
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:43,651
My mother should not get
tension in the village.

918
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:45,558
Everything will be fine. You go.

919
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:51,366
What are you saying?
Thank God for that. No.

920
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:54,529
Click when Nihaal
comes close to the girl.

921
00:44:54,605 --> 00:44:56,095
One sec. One sec.

922
00:44:58,609 --> 00:45:01,601
Not now. Not now. Wait. Listen to me.

923
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,913
Yeah. Like that.

924
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:07,007
On the count of one, two, three...

925
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:10,417
Oh, damn! l missed her.

926
00:45:10,521 --> 00:45:12,989
l didn't even say
three and you clicked.

927
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:14,957
You were trying to be a photographer.

928
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,925
Show me. Show me. Show me.
- lt's very nice. - Look at it.

929
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:19,520
What's this?

930
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:22,030
lt's nice? - At least l
clicked your picture with a man.

931
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:24,294
She clicked your
picture with the statue.

932
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:36,435
Shit. Out.

933
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:41,710
Yes.

934
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:45,288
Oh father, no.

935
00:45:49,493 --> 00:45:50,790
Father, why are you slapping me?

936
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:52,886
Don't you respect your father?
- Uncle..

937
00:45:52,997 --> 00:45:55,329
You're disconnecting my calls. -
Father, l was clicking his picture...

938
00:45:55,433 --> 00:45:56,695
You're concerned about the picture.

939
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:59,395
lsn't your father.. - Uncle,
one minute. Show me the picture.

940
00:45:59,603 --> 00:46:01,935
l couldn't click. Father
kept calling in between.

941
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:03,870
l'm very angry.

942
00:46:03,974 --> 00:46:05,168
Now you..

943
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:09,343
Don't you respect your father?
- Uncle, where's the coffee?

944
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:12,207
l dropped the idea of having coffee.

945
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:15,377
l was thinking that
coffee would spoil our taste.

946
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:17,010
Moreover, it will cost us 8 dollars.

947
00:46:17,088 --> 00:46:20,683
l've brought two lemons.
We'll make a cool drink at home.

948
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:24,285
Please forgive me. l beg of you.
Will you do me a favor?

949
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:27,023
What?
- Don't try to help me!

950
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:31,460
l have taken a stand..
- Ouch! Father, slow down.

951
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:33,734
l'll have to do something.

952
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:51,882
Taari has selected a wonderful photo.

953
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,589
Mother will keep you
carefully like a glass item.

954
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:04,694
l just feel like
staring at her all the time.

955
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:07,731
Your coffee.

956
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:09,231
Thanks.

957
00:47:34,231 --> 00:47:36,358
l don't think this
will happen so easily.

958
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,593
l'll have to do something.

959
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,024
Six.

960
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:47,664
Hello.

961
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:55,436
What have you done?
There was no sound.

962
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:56,774
l will tell you.

963
00:49:58,575 --> 00:50:00,873
These are just five.
Where's the sixth one?

964
00:50:12,723 --> 00:50:15,658
May your soul rest in peace.

965
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:18,092
My heroine is gone.

966
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:19,389
Madam, they ran away..

967
00:50:19,496 --> 00:50:21,794
l tried a lot, but l
could not catch them.

968
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:23,196
Excuse me, who are you?

969
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:24,766
Mind your own business alright.

970
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:26,394
Talking to her.

971
00:50:26,503 --> 00:50:28,198
Madam, very good English.

972
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:30,330
But myself Nihaal Singh Grewa.

973
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:32,671
Party President,
Rutuberand College, Nabba.

974
00:50:32,743 --> 00:50:34,005
All right. All right. All right.
- One minute!

975
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:35,636
All right. Whoever you are..

976
00:50:35,713 --> 00:50:37,510
Whoever you are, don't
create a scene here, please.

977
00:50:37,581 --> 00:50:39,105
But l.. for you..

978
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:40,777
But Madam, listen to me..

979
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:42,078
Hello.

980
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:46,648
What use are you? l will beat you up.

981
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:51,321
Bye.

982
00:50:51,795 --> 00:50:53,422
Now crush my foot also.

983
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,931
Uncle, what does she
think of herself? That witch!

984
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:06,840
Amazing. l really enjoyed the abuses.

985
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,141
You reminded me of Punjab.

986
00:51:10,214 --> 00:51:11,772
Please say it once more.

987
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:15,444
Uncle, l was humiliated. That witch!

988
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:20,256
lt was amazing! lt was amazing!

989
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:21,949
These are called abuses!

990
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:25,085
The abuses here are so boring.

991
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:27,060
Stupid. ldiot.

992
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:30,223
Abuses should be such that
when you abuse a buffalo..

993
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,427
..she shouldn't give
milk for two days.

994
00:51:32,503 --> 00:51:33,868
Only then are they real abuses.

995
00:51:33,937 --> 00:51:35,063
Say it once more.

996
00:51:35,172 --> 00:51:36,605
l was humiliated.

997
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:38,800
ln front of everyone,
she said, Who are you?

998
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:42,141
So what if she said Who are you?

999
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:45,440
Hasn't anyone said Who
are you to you before?

1000
00:51:45,516 --> 00:51:46,949
To me?
- Yeah.

1001
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:51,048
Rimpi from Ramgard had said it.

1002
00:51:52,456 --> 00:51:55,653
Tell them what the
Ramgard female told you.

1003
00:51:56,393 --> 00:51:58,623
Uncle, you act
stupid when you're drunk.

1004
00:51:58,729 --> 00:52:00,492
l'm not alone.

1005
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:03,465
The whole world acts
stupid when they're drunk.

1006
00:52:03,534 --> 00:52:05,729
Tell them what she said.

1007
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:08,863
Uncle, she just told me,
Who are you? - Yes.

1008
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:12,066
Then l turned on my magic.
- Really?

1009
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:16,473
After a few days she was following me.

1010
00:52:16,547 --> 00:52:19,380
After that, once when l
was drunk, l called her.

1011
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:22,113
Her number.. l don't know..

1012
00:52:22,219 --> 00:52:25,985
lt was 164075..

1013
00:52:26,056 --> 00:52:27,956
l don't know whether it was 134..

1014
00:52:28,058 --> 00:52:30,390
No problem. You talk
- Okay.

1015
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:32,020
What does she say?

1016
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:35,097
Uncle, it's still ringing. Wait.
- Okay.

1017
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:39,102
Hello. Rimpi. lt's me.

1018
00:52:39,203 --> 00:52:40,329
What does she say?

1019
00:52:40,604 --> 00:52:42,071
Let me talk to her first.

1020
00:52:42,673 --> 00:52:43,799
Where are you?

1021
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:46,269
What does she say? Tell me.

1022
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:51,046
She says she has gone
to her aunt's house.

1023
00:52:51,114 --> 00:52:52,638
One. Two. Three.

1024
00:52:54,485 --> 00:52:56,851
l asked her where are you.

1025
00:52:56,954 --> 00:52:58,046
Where are you.

1026
00:52:58,121 --> 00:53:00,521
She had gone to her
aunt's house in the village.

1027
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:02,057
To her aunt's house.

1028
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:03,558
l asked her what she did.

1029
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:06,892
She said she was sitting
with her sister-in-law.

1030
00:53:06,964 --> 00:53:08,829
l asked her where are you.

1031
00:53:08,932 --> 00:53:11,162
She had gone to her
aunt's house in the village.

1032
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:12,725
To her aunt's house.

1033
00:53:12,803 --> 00:53:14,236
l asked her what she did.

1034
00:53:14,304 --> 00:53:16,829
She said she was sitting
with her sister-in-law.

1035
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,168
Was sitting with her sister-in-law.

1036
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:21,700
Since morning, l tried your phone.

1037
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:24,872
l couldn't sleep at night.
You've driven me crazy.

1038
00:53:24,948 --> 00:53:27,815
But you did not answer.
- But you did not answer.

1039
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:30,719
l dozed off.

1040
00:53:30,821 --> 00:53:33,119
l dozed off.

1041
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,455
l asked her where are you.

1042
00:53:35,526 --> 00:53:38,051
She had gone to her
aunt's house in the village.

1043
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:41,291
To her aunt's house.

1044
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:51,937
Where had you gone, without
informing, leaving your old friend.

1045
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:55,478
She said she had
informed me in an email.

1046
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:58,912
ln an email.

1047
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:02,645
Where had you gone, without
informing, leaving your old friend.

1048
00:54:02,753 --> 00:54:05,847
She said she had
informed me in an email.

1049
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:07,390
l asked her if she wants to come.

1050
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:09,083
Don't want to come.

1051
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:12,458
She met me just yesterday.

1052
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:14,594
l asked her where are you.

1053
00:54:14,698 --> 00:54:17,166
She had gone to her
aunt's house in the village.

1054
00:54:17,234 --> 00:54:21,193
To her aunt's house.

1055
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:26,237
To her aunt's house.

1056
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:32,873
l was listening to
sad songs on my iPhone.

1057
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:36,647
She said she danced
and had fun at night.

1058
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,053
Danced at night.

1059
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:43,490
l was listening to
sad songs on my iPhone.

1060
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,688
She said she danced
and had fun at night.

1061
00:54:46,763 --> 00:54:48,458
l said.. l wish..

1062
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:50,260
l said.. l wish..

1063
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:52,598
She said she had been to a party.

1064
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:55,365
Had gone to a party.

1065
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:57,235
l asked her where are you.

1066
00:54:57,341 --> 00:54:59,832
She had gone to her
aunt's house in the village.

1067
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,969
To her aunt's house.

1068
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,196
Hello, mother.

1069
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:24,233
Hello, son. Hello.

1070
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:27,098
So, you forgot your mother
after going to my daughter-in-law.

1071
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,104
What are you saying, mother?

1072
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,933
Where is my daughter-in-law, son?

1073
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:33,306
She is with me.

1074
00:55:33,443 --> 00:55:35,673
l mean she has brought me Downtown.

1075
00:55:35,746 --> 00:55:37,338
Where? Downtown?

1076
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:39,712
lt's a city, mother. A city. Yes.

1077
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:42,274
Mother, she takes me
around in her scooter.

1078
00:55:42,352 --> 00:55:44,650
Sometimes to her relatives,
to her sisters.

1079
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:48,054
What should l tell you? l'm
being talked about everywhere.

1080
00:55:48,158 --> 00:55:49,989
Today she fed me
'Seviya' (sweet dish).

1081
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,460
Your daughter-in-law made it herself.

1082
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:54,497
She made 'Seviya' for him.

1083
00:55:54,598 --> 00:55:58,364
He's lying. Would a Canadian
girl know to make 'Seviya'?

1084
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:01,335
Tell him that l want to
talk to daughter-in-law.

1085
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:05,071
Okay. Your aunt wants to
talk to daughter-in-law.

1086
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:06,301
She wants to talk?

1087
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:07,968
She has never spoken to
her own daughter-in-law..

1088
00:56:08,078 --> 00:56:10,672
..and she wants to talk to
others' daughters-in-law. Nonsense!

1089
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:13,011
l won't allow her.
- Don't say that.

1090
00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:15,380
l feel like talking too.
Let me talk to her.

1091
00:56:15,452 --> 00:56:16,544
Mother, she's your daughter-in-law.

1092
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,520
You can talk to her to
your heart's content.

1093
00:56:18,622 --> 00:56:20,817
But.. Hello. Mother.

1094
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:23,223
Hello. Hello, Nihaal.

1095
00:56:23,293 --> 00:56:24,419
Hello.

1096
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:26,987
l think the line got disconnected.

1097
00:56:27,097 --> 00:56:28,997
Did the line get disconnected
or did he do it on purpose?

1098
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:30,726
God knows.

1099
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:44,344
Here. lt's him.

1100
00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:47,676
Hello, Nihaal.

1101
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:50,219
Hello, mother. Jasneet speaking.

1102
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,686
How are you?
- Hello, dear.

1103
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:55,718
Bless you. May you always be married.

1104
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:58,393
We've been eagerly
waiting for you here.

1105
00:56:58,528 --> 00:56:59,620
Really, mother?

1106
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:01,323
l miss you a lot too.

1107
00:57:01,398 --> 00:57:04,060
But don't worry. We're
coming to meet you soon.

1108
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:08,036
Dear, speak to your aunt. l'm
putting the phone on loudspeaker.

1109
00:57:08,238 --> 00:57:09,933
Aunt. On the speaker?

1110
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,200
What?
- Yes.

1111
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:13,299
Hello, aunt. Yes.

1112
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,173
How are you, dear?

1113
00:57:15,245 --> 00:57:16,906
Why did you put the
phone on loudspeaker?

1114
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,675
Put it on the
loudspeaker of the Gurudwara.

1115
00:57:18,749 --> 00:57:20,114
Tell the whole village.

1116
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:22,913
Aunt, you keep gossiping
about every house in the village.

1117
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:27,546
l know everything. l'll have
to talk to uncle to shut you up.

1118
00:57:27,657 --> 00:57:29,147
Turn this off.

1119
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:31,194
He doesn't think before talking.

1120
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:32,660
Oh, God!

1121
00:57:32,763 --> 00:57:33,889
Hello!

1122
00:57:34,698 --> 00:57:35,892
Nihaal!
- Yes?

1123
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:37,829
Why did you talk so rudely to aunt?

1124
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:39,561
Everything has
happened because of her.

1125
00:57:39,669 --> 00:57:41,296
They asked me to get the
girl and not her picture.

1126
00:57:41,371 --> 00:57:42,929
ls it so easy to get the girl..

1127
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:44,597
..that l'd ask her
and she'd come along?

1128
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:46,232
The picture has created a problem.

1129
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:51,105
lt would have been better if you
had shown your mother my picture.

1130
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:52,307
Really?

1131
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:55,943
Then mother would never let me come.

1132
00:57:56,987 --> 00:57:58,079
Nihaal!

1133
00:58:38,762 --> 00:58:40,389
Help! Help!

1134
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:46,633
Help!

1135
00:58:52,075 --> 00:58:53,975
Help!

1136
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:12,193
Help!

1137
01:00:24,601 --> 01:00:26,933
When lovers fall in love,
they do so with passion.

1138
01:00:28,204 --> 01:00:30,729
When they fight,
they fight like a Jatt.

1139
01:01:06,509 --> 01:01:08,033
What's your name?
- Nihaal.

1140
01:01:08,144 --> 01:01:09,304
Very good.

1141
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:13,810
We don't have any enmity.
We don't have any enemies.

1142
01:01:14,317 --> 01:01:16,877
Then l wonder who's
attacking my niece.

1143
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:19,445
Who is after her life?

1144
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:21,421
Mr. Siddhu, l can't be sure about it..

1145
01:01:21,524 --> 01:01:23,890
..but on the 20th of last month,
someone tried to..

1146
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,361
..mess with Jasneet's father's will.

1147
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:31,699
According to it, if anything happens
to Jasneet before she turns 21..

1148
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:33,493
..then the entire property
will be equally distributed..

1149
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:34,730
..among the relatives.

1150
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:36,271
What do you mean to say?

1151
01:01:36,439 --> 01:01:38,031
Look, don't misunderstand me.

1152
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:40,702
The documents were
leaked one month back.

1153
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:42,641
Since then, Jasneet is being attacked.

1154
01:01:42,712 --> 01:01:46,944
l feel there is surely some
connection between these two things.

1155
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:48,244
lt's possible.

1156
01:01:48,852 --> 01:01:50,149
Do one thing, dear.

1157
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:52,380
l suggest don't leave the
house for the next two months.

1158
01:01:52,622 --> 01:01:55,056
And what if the enemy is in the house?

1159
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:57,958
What do you mean to say?
That l'm attacking my niece?

1160
01:01:58,028 --> 01:02:01,122
You are saying it yourself.
l didn't accuse anyone.

1161
01:02:01,231 --> 01:02:03,825
She's my niece! My flesh and blood!

1162
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,063
Not like you outsider, who
killed my brother as soon as she came!

1163
01:02:07,303 --> 01:02:09,396
lt had been just one
month to your marriage.

1164
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:11,834
And my brother was
killed in an accident.

1165
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:14,168
l doubt you.

1166
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:16,073
You have done this

1167
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:18,410
Now you are acting
innocent in front of me.

1168
01:02:18,681 --> 01:02:19,943
Dear, you stay with me.

1169
01:02:20,016 --> 01:02:21,984
Let me see who attacks you.

1170
01:02:22,052 --> 01:02:26,216
Yes, take my daughter along.
So that its easy for you.

1171
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:27,722
One minute, mom!

1172
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:29,552
Can you guys please stop fighting!

1173
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:34,287
Uncle, if you really care for me..

1174
01:02:35,398 --> 01:02:37,229
..hire Nihaal as my bodyguard.

1175
01:02:38,034 --> 01:02:39,194
As you wish, dear.

1176
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:47,173
Son, are you ready to take up
the job of Jasneet's bodyguard?

1177
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:48,437
l'm absolutely ready.

1178
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:52,175
Think about it, son. You'll have
to be with Jasneet all the time.

1179
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:53,442
What's there to think?

1180
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:55,916
lt's a 24-hour service.
l'll work dedicatedly.

1181
01:02:55,985 --> 01:03:00,786
Good. All right, then.
Until Jasneet turns 21..

1182
01:03:00,857 --> 01:03:03,553
..it's your
responsibility to protect her life.

1183
01:03:03,626 --> 01:03:05,992
Don't worry. Don't take tension.

1184
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:07,393
Forget about 21 years..

1185
01:03:07,497 --> 01:03:09,431
..it's my responsibility to
protect her till eternity.

1186
01:03:09,866 --> 01:03:12,232
That's good. Thank you,
son. Thank you.

1187
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:17,197
Strange.

1188
01:03:17,307 --> 01:03:19,468
ln the village, people try to
protect girls from Nihaal Singh.

1189
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:21,840
But here, Nihaal Singh has
been hired to protect a girl.

1190
01:03:22,178 --> 01:03:23,611
Canadians are smart.

1191
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:25,374
They understood Nihaal Singh's talent.

1192
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:28,940
lt's the sunshine in the moonlight.

1193
01:03:29,052 --> 01:03:32,215
Feeling on my face all bright.

1194
01:03:32,322 --> 01:03:35,917
My heart is pumping out
with the pace of love.

1195
01:03:35,992 --> 01:03:39,655
There is rhythm on my mind.

1196
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:42,493
Get up and go get a life.

1197
01:03:42,632 --> 01:03:45,897
Party, go party tonight.

1198
01:03:46,136 --> 01:03:49,537
Go and get yourself a fight.

1199
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:52,834
Come on, go get it.

1200
01:03:53,676 --> 01:03:57,339
You wear sleeveless clothes.

1201
01:03:57,447 --> 01:04:00,905
You shake your waist.

1202
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:04,350
You wear sleeveless clothes.

1203
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,856
You shake your waist.

1204
01:04:07,957 --> 01:04:11,415
l'm crazy about you, girl.

1205
01:04:11,494 --> 01:04:15,555
l'm your fan, girl.

1206
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:35,013
Because of you, the
boys fight each other.

1207
01:04:35,084 --> 01:04:36,813
The boys fight each other.

1208
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,387
The boys fight each other.

1209
01:04:38,488 --> 01:04:42,151
Single handsome guy,
aims for your heart.

1210
01:04:42,225 --> 01:04:43,954
Aims for your heart.

1211
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,425
Aims for your heart.

1212
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:48,987
Because of you, the
boys fight each other.

1213
01:04:49,098 --> 01:04:52,590
Single handsome guy,
aims for your heart.

1214
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:56,127
The dresses that you wear.

1215
01:04:56,206 --> 01:04:59,232
Your back is bare.

1216
01:04:59,342 --> 01:05:02,971
You're like a can of beer, girl.

1217
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:06,914
l'm your fan, girl.

1218
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,814
Your fashion is hot. lt burns me.

1219
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:43,943
lt burns me. lt burns me.

1220
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,922
What you do.. l don't
understand your action.

1221
01:05:47,991 --> 01:05:51,154
l don't understand your action.
l don't understand your action.

1222
01:05:51,261 --> 01:05:54,753
Your fashion is hot. lt burns me.

1223
01:05:54,864 --> 01:05:58,391
What you do.. l don't
understand your action.

1224
01:05:58,468 --> 01:06:01,733
The dresses that you wear.

1225
01:06:01,804 --> 01:06:05,240
Your back is bare.

1226
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:08,708
You will kill me, girl.

1227
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:12,611
l'm your fan, girl.

1228
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:34,498
So, Nihaal. What do you want to have?

1229
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,265
No, thanks, l don't
want to drink anything.

1230
01:06:36,372 --> 01:06:37,999
What? Have something atleast.

1231
01:06:38,107 --> 01:06:40,007
Coffee, cold drink. Something.

1232
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:41,868
Coffee, cold drink, at this time?

1233
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:43,775
Why? What do you mean this time?

1234
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,314
At this time a Jatt will drink
2-3 drinks and must be sleeping.

1235
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:48,244
Then have it.

1236
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:49,911
Should l drink?

1237
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:51,686
Yes, have one.

1238
01:06:52,755 --> 01:06:57,351
Okay. But look, l'm not in
favor of drinking during work.

1239
01:06:57,427 --> 01:07:00,191
l am a bodyguard. Not a
policeman who will be drunk.

1240
01:07:00,296 --> 01:07:03,595
But if you insist, l'll have one.
- But please stop me.

1241
01:07:03,666 --> 01:07:06,533
Look, after drinking one..

1242
01:07:07,036 --> 01:07:08,435
..l become a little..

1243
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:12,639
Okay?
- Okay, have one. l'll stop you.

1244
01:07:24,787 --> 01:07:27,381
Madam, it's nothing serious.

1245
01:07:27,757 --> 01:07:30,817
lt's just that after drinking,
the love within me awakens.

1246
01:07:30,893 --> 01:07:32,827
l feel like expressing my feelings.

1247
01:07:32,895 --> 01:07:35,056
You're sitting in front of me.

1248
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:38,999
l mean.. l must say..
l love you, madam.

1249
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:42,160
No, no. l mean.. not this.

1250
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:46,139
lf someone is in love and his
girlfriend is sitting in front of him..

1251
01:07:46,242 --> 01:07:48,107
..he'll feel like saying it.

1252
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:50,839
You get the courage. Right?

1253
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:55,813
But madam, since l'm
drunk today, let me tell you.

1254
01:07:56,185 --> 01:07:57,709
You're very beautiful, madam.

1255
01:07:58,221 --> 01:07:59,620
l am amazed.

1256
01:07:59,689 --> 01:08:04,524
Thank you. - When l saw you for
the first time, my heart said it.

1257
01:08:04,594 --> 01:08:05,754
From within.

1258
01:08:06,462 --> 01:08:08,692
You are soft material.

1259
01:08:08,765 --> 01:08:09,959
What?

1260
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:11,329
What does that mean?

1261
01:08:11,968 --> 01:08:15,199
lt means..

1262
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:17,570
..soft material.

1263
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:21,109
Soft..?

1264
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:24,607
Nihaal.. what does that mean?

1265
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,740
Madam, you understood
what l meant to say.

1266
01:08:28,151 --> 01:08:29,914
You are very beautiful.

1267
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,982
Thank you, Nihaal.

1268
01:08:32,054 --> 01:08:35,854
You are just like those
heroines of English movies.

1269
01:08:35,925 --> 01:08:37,654
You watch English movies?

1270
01:08:38,227 --> 01:08:43,324
Of course. What else do
we do on Taari's motor?

1271
01:08:46,169 --> 01:08:48,262
Taari's motor...

1272
01:08:48,371 --> 01:08:50,862
Which movie have you
watched on Taari's motor?

1273
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,874
Forget about that. That's just...

1274
01:08:52,942 --> 01:08:55,638
But l've watched
'Titanic' on my mobile phone.

1275
01:08:55,745 --> 01:08:57,178
Why did you watch it
on your mobile phone?

1276
01:08:57,246 --> 01:08:58,838
Why didn't you watch it on TV at home?

1277
01:08:59,015 --> 01:09:01,677
You can't watch such movies at home.

1278
01:09:01,784 --> 01:09:03,183
lt's a clean movie.

1279
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:05,015
'Titanic'?
- Of course.

1280
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:06,418
What are you saying?

1281
01:09:06,522 --> 01:09:08,149
The ship sank on time..

1282
01:09:08,257 --> 01:09:10,919
..or else they had made
all arrangements to mess up.

1283
01:09:10,993 --> 01:09:13,257
Paintings were being made.

1284
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:16,821
All the boys in the village
have it in their mobile phones.

1285
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,459
Some of them only have that scene.

1286
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:20,968
Stop, Nihaal.

1287
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:25,266
Madam, you must be thinking,
what sort of a guy l am talking to.

1288
01:09:25,641 --> 01:09:30,840
l mean to say that richness
and poverty is nothing, madam.

1289
01:09:30,947 --> 01:09:32,107
lt's just a circumstance.

1290
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:34,342
There should be love in your heart.

1291
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:36,180
A rich person can love a poor person.

1292
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:39,186
A poor person can love a rich person.
- You're right.

1293
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:43,056
Love doesn't care about
riches or poverty. - Right.

1294
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:44,615
Love is just love.

1295
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:47,527
lf love had cared
about riches or poverty..

1296
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:51,163
..then Roop wouldn't
have been in my life.

1297
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,040
Roop is the one who l love.

1298
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:04,110
Where is Roop now, madam?

1299
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:05,340
Roop?

1300
01:10:06,215 --> 01:10:10,447
Roop lives in America most
of the time due to business.

1301
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:16,123
You're being attacked
here and Roop is in America?

1302
01:10:16,192 --> 01:10:19,320
Roop doesn't know about it,
because l haven't told him.

1303
01:10:19,395 --> 01:10:20,828
This is true love.

1304
01:10:21,497 --> 01:10:23,988
lf l tell him, he'll
come here running.

1305
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:27,399
And l didn't want to
put him in danger.

1306
01:10:28,371 --> 01:10:30,339
His life could be in danger too.

1307
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:33,600
This is called true love.

1308
01:10:42,285 --> 01:10:44,253
l'll just make a call.

1309
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:46,547
Sure.

1310
01:10:58,668 --> 01:11:02,195
Hello. - Taari, could
you find only this girl?

1311
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:03,738
Firstly, she doesn't speak Punjabi.

1312
01:11:03,806 --> 01:11:06,240
Secondly, she belongs
to a very rich family.

1313
01:11:06,309 --> 01:11:09,870
Moreover, she has five
bodyguards and a boyfriend too.

1314
01:11:09,979 --> 01:11:12,311
Your mother has organized
veneration in the temple.

1315
01:11:12,381 --> 01:11:14,315
She has shown her
picture to the whole village.

1316
01:11:14,383 --> 01:11:16,908
Moreover, the eunuchs danced and
took Rs. 21000 from your house.

1317
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:21,681
Listen, whatever is
happening let it happen.

1318
01:11:26,829 --> 01:11:29,764
No. Nothing can be done now.

1319
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,927
Nothing can be done.

1320
01:11:33,869 --> 01:11:35,962
Yes, there's an idea.

1321
01:11:36,138 --> 01:11:38,504
Do one thing. Go back to Nabba.

1322
01:11:38,574 --> 01:11:42,738
Fall at everyone's feet there and
tell them that you made a mistake.

1323
01:11:42,845 --> 01:11:44,745
Son, people make
mistakes in their youth.

1324
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:46,042
One minute, uncle.

1325
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:48,212
Nihaal, why are you so sad?

1326
01:11:49,418 --> 01:11:51,443
So what if she has a boyfriend?

1327
01:11:52,488 --> 01:11:55,514
You didn't come here to make
her your girlfriend, right?

1328
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:59,850
Look, make her fear your strength.

1329
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:02,258
Anyway, she trusts you..

1330
01:12:02,365 --> 01:12:03,957
..or else she wouldn't
have told you about Roop.

1331
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,531
She feels safe with you.

1332
01:12:06,636 --> 01:12:09,070
Nihaal, l have an idea.

1333
01:12:09,438 --> 01:12:12,601
All of us together will
scare her so much.. so much..

1334
01:12:12,675 --> 01:12:15,542
..that she'll realize that she
feels safe only with Nihaal.

1335
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:17,972
Whether it's lndia or Canada.

1336
01:12:19,515 --> 01:12:22,109
By the way, what's
her plan for tomorrow?

1337
01:12:23,486 --> 01:12:24,680
Scrapyard.

1338
01:12:38,501 --> 01:12:40,366
Where is he?

1339
01:12:41,704 --> 01:12:44,571
l hope he didn't get scared
while trying to scare the girl.

1340
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,904
He's left me in a graveyard of cars.

1341
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,577
lt's been quite long.

1342
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:52,578
lt's sorted. Thank you. Thank you.

1343
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,248
Nihaal!

1344
01:12:58,654 --> 01:12:59,780
Nihaal!

1345
01:12:59,889 --> 01:13:01,584
Look at his gun.

1346
01:13:01,657 --> 01:13:02,988
Rascal.

1347
01:13:08,964 --> 01:13:10,625
Leave me.

1348
01:13:15,171 --> 01:13:17,230
Bravo! Leave her.

1349
01:13:17,973 --> 01:13:19,634
You're pointing your gun at a girl.

1350
01:13:19,709 --> 01:13:21,267
You want to shoot?

1351
01:13:21,911 --> 01:13:23,242
Don't be scared. lt's nothing.

1352
01:13:23,345 --> 01:13:28,112
Shoot a man. Point your gun at
a man if you have the courage.

1353
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:29,411
Here. Properly.

1354
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:32,485
Shoot. l'm standing right here.

1355
01:15:17,393 --> 01:15:19,361
Nihaal!

1356
01:15:39,114 --> 01:15:40,706
You... rascal

1357
01:15:42,985 --> 01:15:44,247
You escaped, Nihaal Singh.

1358
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,719
The bullet just scrapped through.

1359
01:15:45,788 --> 01:15:47,380
lf l have to take the
girl alive to mother..

1360
01:15:47,456 --> 01:15:50,016
..l will have to leave Canada.

1361
01:15:50,659 --> 01:15:51,785
Come sit.

1362
01:15:51,861 --> 01:15:54,125
lt's okay. lt's okay. Sit in the car.

1363
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:55,788
Nihaal, what's going on?

1364
01:15:55,898 --> 01:15:57,627
l just don't understand.

1365
01:15:58,033 --> 01:16:01,366
Who is hell-bent on killing me?

1366
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:03,231
What have l done to him?

1367
01:16:03,572 --> 01:16:04,937
lt's simple, madam.

1368
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:07,902
After two weeks, you'll turn 21.

1369
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:11,312
All your property will be
transferred to your name.

1370
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:15,045
But l feel one of your
relatives doesn't want you..

1371
01:16:15,117 --> 01:16:17,051
..to own your property.

1372
01:16:17,253 --> 01:16:18,413
Relatives?

1373
01:16:19,221 --> 01:16:23,157
What do you mean? Mother? Uncle?

1374
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:27,627
No. This is hard to believe.

1375
01:16:28,764 --> 01:16:32,928
But whoever it is, l will find out.

1376
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:36,066
Madam, to find him,
you'll have to remain alive.

1377
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:37,829
And seeing the situation..

1378
01:16:37,907 --> 01:16:40,307
..neither will you be
alive for long, nor will l.

1379
01:16:40,409 --> 01:16:43,867
How much can l protect you
in this unknown country?

1380
01:16:43,946 --> 01:16:45,937
Listen to me. These two weeks..

1381
01:16:46,048 --> 01:16:50,542
..until you turn 21, without
telling anyone come to Punjab with me.

1382
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:53,044
Punjab?
- Punjab.

1383
01:16:53,422 --> 01:16:55,014
But l have no one in Punjab.

1384
01:16:56,058 --> 01:16:58,026
You still feel that you
have no one in Punjab?

1385
01:16:58,961 --> 01:17:03,557
Nihaal Singh will die, but won't
let any harm come to Jasneet Kaur.

1386
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:05,959
But...

1387
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:11,033
But Roop? l can't go
without informing Roop.

1388
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,732
l'll have to tell him.

1389
01:17:13,642 --> 01:17:15,041
That poor boy..
- Madam.

1390
01:17:15,878 --> 01:17:17,675
We're not going to a fair, madam.

1391
01:17:17,846 --> 01:17:19,211
lt's a game of death.

1392
01:17:19,415 --> 01:17:22,213
l will save you, but
who will save your Roop?

1393
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:29,887
You have trusted so
many people till now.

1394
01:17:30,459 --> 01:17:32,757
Trust Nihaal Singh this time.

1395
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,899
See that you don't break my trust.

1396
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:11,243
Hail the Lord. Victory to the Lord.

1397
01:18:11,351 --> 01:18:15,378
Everyone is being informed
that Fiat Nihaal Singh..

1398
01:18:15,455 --> 01:18:19,289
..is bringing his wife
Jasneet from Canada.

1399
01:18:25,031 --> 01:18:26,293
What's wrong with you?

1400
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,731
Why are you crying? At least
tell me what the matter is.

1401
01:18:28,902 --> 01:18:32,497
Uncle, l'm ruined. l'm heartbroken.

1402
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:38,606
l'm surprised too. Who
gave this boy his daughter?

1403
01:18:38,678 --> 01:18:42,079
Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh. Singh. Singh.

1404
01:18:42,148 --> 01:18:45,083
Oh God! - You had said there
is no girl in his destiny.

1405
01:18:45,151 --> 01:18:47,381
Sir, he brought a girl along.

1406
01:18:47,487 --> 01:18:49,546
l wonder what Nihaal is made up of.

1407
01:18:49,656 --> 01:18:51,817
His stars don't meet with mine.

1408
01:18:51,891 --> 01:18:55,418
Singh. Singh. Singh. Singh.

1409
01:18:56,262 --> 01:18:57,559
l'm surprised.

1410
01:18:57,831 --> 01:19:00,459
He's a dropout and l passed BEd.

1411
01:19:00,533 --> 01:19:02,592
How did he get a Canadian girl?

1412
01:19:02,669 --> 01:19:05,399
Son, l agree that
Nihaal is a scheming guy.

1413
01:19:05,505 --> 01:19:08,997
But which scheme did he use that
he brought a Canadian girl along?

1414
01:19:09,075 --> 01:19:11,873
Yes, aunt. Go there and have tea.
- Nihaal is nearly reaching.

1415
01:19:11,978 --> 01:19:14,446
So soon?

1416
01:19:14,514 --> 01:19:15,572
Strange.

1417
01:19:15,682 --> 01:19:17,741
At the speed they are coming, l
hope they don't cross the house.

1418
01:19:17,851 --> 01:19:18,943
Go and stand on the road.

1419
01:19:19,018 --> 01:19:21,748
Taari, tell me something.
ls everything else done?

1420
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,152
Yes, everything else is done, aunt.

1421
01:19:23,256 --> 01:19:25,053
Just one thing is left to be done.

1422
01:19:25,258 --> 01:19:26,350
What is that?

1423
01:19:26,459 --> 01:19:29,553
Everyone is married,
aunt. Now get me married too.

1424
01:19:30,163 --> 01:19:33,724
l've told you so many times to
offer prayers at the temple.

1425
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,268
l'm ready to do whatever it takes..

1426
01:19:36,336 --> 01:19:37,633
..but it should prove to be fruitful.

1427
01:19:37,704 --> 01:19:40,639
Stop, stop. Stop the car right now.

1428
01:19:41,274 --> 01:19:43,401
What happened now? Why
has she stopped the car?

1429
01:19:43,476 --> 01:19:45,774
The village is far. Why
has she stopped the car?

1430
01:19:45,879 --> 01:19:48,279
Hello. Madam, what happened?

1431
01:19:48,348 --> 01:19:50,339
No way. l'm not wearing
these kinds of clothes.

1432
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:53,681
Bloody bed sheets! l'm
feeling hot in these!

1433
01:19:53,753 --> 01:19:54,845
l won't wear these clothes.

1434
01:19:54,921 --> 01:19:56,013
Strange. You're the first
girl who's saying that..

1435
01:19:56,122 --> 01:19:57,214
..she doesn't want to wear clothes.

1436
01:19:57,290 --> 01:19:58,552
What kind of clothes
have you made me wear?

1437
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,593
l was feeling hot in an AC car.

1438
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,252
Actually, the AC of
the car is not working.

1439
01:20:02,328 --> 01:20:03,420
lt's working, sir.

1440
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:04,690
Then why didn't you turn it on?

1441
01:20:04,764 --> 01:20:06,664
Brother Taari paid me for a Non AC.

1442
01:20:06,733 --> 01:20:08,598
That rascal Taari.
- Oh, gosh!

1443
01:20:08,668 --> 01:20:11,501
So many clothes! Moreover, the
AC in the car is not working.

1444
01:20:11,571 --> 01:20:13,471
l need to change.
Driver, open the dickey.

1445
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:15,167
Okay, madam.
- Hey! No open!

1446
01:20:15,441 --> 01:20:17,807
You can't change your clothes,
Jasneet. - Let her change, sir.

1447
01:20:17,877 --> 01:20:20,004
l'll slap you! Come on,
sit in the car!

1448
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:23,674
Jasneet, look, you'll have to keep
your identity card a secret here.

1449
01:20:23,783 --> 01:20:24,875
ldentity card?

1450
01:20:24,951 --> 01:20:26,441
l mean no one should recognize you.

1451
01:20:26,519 --> 01:20:27,918
But who will recognize me here?

1452
01:20:27,987 --> 01:20:29,386
No one in the world
might recognize you..

1453
01:20:29,489 --> 01:20:30,820
..as much as the
people of our village do.

1454
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:33,256
What? - lf you wear short
dresses and roam about..

1455
01:20:33,326 --> 01:20:34,725
..then someone will
surely recognize you.

1456
01:20:34,794 --> 01:20:37,456
There's internet, Google,
everything in villages nowadays.

1457
01:20:37,564 --> 01:20:40,328
People sit on motors and
print pictures of girls.

1458
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,595
Listen to me. Look, l've
grown a beard for your sake.

1459
01:20:42,669 --> 01:20:44,330
l've changed my identity card for you.

1460
01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:45,666
Please try to understand.

1461
01:20:45,772 --> 01:20:48,434
Jasneet, you're not Jasneet here.
You're Jasneet Kaur.

1462
01:20:48,508 --> 01:20:50,476
Kaur?
- Kaur means pride.

1463
01:20:50,543 --> 01:20:52,670
Respect your elders
and love the young ones.

1464
01:20:52,745 --> 01:20:54,076
lf there's any problem,
come on the side..

1465
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:55,374
..and discuss it with Nihaal Singh.

1466
01:20:55,481 --> 01:20:57,881
Now sit in the car.
Remaining we will talk at home.

1467
01:20:57,984 --> 01:20:59,246
Whatever.

1468
01:21:00,753 --> 01:21:03,551
Thank God. You are saved here.

1469
01:21:03,656 --> 01:21:05,988
Now wonder how many more lies will
you have to tell on reaching home.

1470
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:07,251
Come.

1471
01:21:10,563 --> 01:21:12,360
Aunt, the confectioner
has done all the work.

1472
01:21:12,432 --> 01:21:14,400
Everything is all set now.
- Thank God. - Yes..

1473
01:21:14,467 --> 01:21:16,526
He's here.

1474
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:18,437
Come, come. Alight.

1475
01:21:18,504 --> 01:21:20,904
Call my mother.. Bebe.

1476
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:25,540
Simpo, come. He's here!
My dear son has come!

1477
01:21:25,645 --> 01:21:27,306
Mother likes to be called Bebe.

1478
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:28,972
You mean, baby, right?

1479
01:21:29,415 --> 01:21:31,815
Not baby, Be.. be..

1480
01:21:31,985 --> 01:21:34,249
Be..
- Be. - Okay.

1481
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,947
Mother.
- Come my son.

1482
01:21:36,022 --> 01:21:38,320
Bless you! Bless you.

1483
01:21:38,391 --> 01:21:40,951
Here you go, mother. l've
brought her from Canada.

1484
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:44,689
She's original. Born
and brought up in Canada.

1485
01:21:44,764 --> 01:21:46,391
Wait. Wait, dear.

1486
01:21:46,466 --> 01:21:48,593
l'm finally seeing this day.

1487
01:21:48,735 --> 01:21:50,566
Let me venerate you.

1488
01:22:05,151 --> 01:22:07,449
Dear, why are you scared?

1489
01:22:10,089 --> 01:22:13,217
Priest, your
predictions are all wrong.

1490
01:22:14,494 --> 01:22:17,429
Nihaal's best friend.
Taranjeet Singh, alias Taari.

1491
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:19,794
Oh God!

1492
01:22:19,899 --> 01:22:21,423
This is impossible.

1493
01:22:22,035 --> 01:22:24,060
Something is surely fishy here.

1494
01:22:24,504 --> 01:22:28,304
Let's wait for a few days.
The truth will be revealed.

1495
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:29,768
Okay.
- Let's go.

1496
01:22:30,143 --> 01:22:31,610
Taari, my turn.

1497
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:35,945
You really brought her.
- Thank you.

1498
01:22:36,049 --> 01:22:37,710
You got hands on the real one.

1499
01:22:37,917 --> 01:22:40,181
We only press the
buttons and are happy.

1500
01:22:40,653 --> 01:22:44,282
Don't laugh, you dog. Get lost.

1501
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:47,816
Rascal. - Your
daughter-in-law is very beautiful.

1502
01:22:47,927 --> 01:22:51,260
The daughter-in-law is so pretty.
- Aunt, why are you jealous?

1503
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:54,390
She's from Canada. Original. Real.

1504
01:22:56,569 --> 01:22:57,763
What kind of a zoo is this?

1505
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:59,667
Why are they singing songs?

1506
01:22:59,872 --> 01:23:02,340
And that other lady.. Why is she
calling me her daughter-in-law?

1507
01:23:03,209 --> 01:23:04,642
What do l tell you, Jasneet?

1508
01:23:11,918 --> 01:23:14,751
Do you know when the last marriage
took place in our village? - When?

1509
01:23:14,821 --> 01:23:17,221
ln the year 1993,
when there was a flood.

1510
01:23:17,423 --> 01:23:19,220
What?
- Flood.

1511
01:23:19,325 --> 01:23:21,816
Oh. - lt was Sajjan's
son's wedding in our village.

1512
01:23:22,195 --> 01:23:23,890
The bus was filled with guests..

1513
01:23:24,397 --> 01:23:26,661
..plummeted into the river.

1514
01:23:28,768 --> 01:23:30,599
l mean it jumped.

1515
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:34,100
Oh, my God. Really?
- Yes.

1516
01:23:35,508 --> 01:23:37,635
Taari's father was driving the bus.

1517
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:39,841
He died.

1518
01:23:40,513 --> 01:23:41,980
Tell her that it happened.

1519
01:23:42,115 --> 01:23:45,175
Yes.. Yes. Yes.

1520
01:23:45,451 --> 01:23:49,046
Along with the bus, father 'thend'.

1521
01:23:49,388 --> 01:23:50,514
'Thend'?

1522
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:55,289
Since his father died, he
reads 'the end' as 'thend'.

1523
01:23:56,496 --> 01:23:59,192
After that accident, no
one has had the courage..

1524
01:23:59,298 --> 01:24:00,959
..to get their son married.

1525
01:24:01,134 --> 01:24:03,762
Now whenever an unmarried
girl comes to our village..

1526
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:06,361
..people address her as
their daughter-in-law..

1527
01:24:06,472 --> 01:24:08,497
..and complete the rituals.

1528
01:24:09,142 --> 01:24:10,837
Papa!
- What?

1529
01:24:11,244 --> 01:24:13,804
l mean.. father.

1530
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,880
Taari, l'm so sorry to hear that.

1531
01:24:16,983 --> 01:24:18,507
Really?
- Yes.

1532
01:24:18,818 --> 01:24:21,286
Why are you troubling my girl?

1533
01:24:21,354 --> 01:24:23,288
Come on, dear. Let's go in.

1534
01:24:25,191 --> 01:24:26,988
What was wrong with you?

1535
01:24:27,059 --> 01:24:29,152
Why did you have to kill my
father who is still alive?

1536
01:24:29,228 --> 01:24:30,923
lf mother finds out anything inside..

1537
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:34,124
..then the villagers
will kill us. Come on.

1538
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:35,732
What's the matter, dear?

1539
01:24:36,169 --> 01:24:37,727
Why are you so sad?

1540
01:24:38,104 --> 01:24:41,198
Nihaal told me everything, mother.

1541
01:24:41,707 --> 01:24:43,368
l felt very sad to hear that.

1542
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:46,942
Sad for what, dear?
- That bus incident...

1543
01:24:47,613 --> 01:24:49,444
God shouldn't do this to anyone.

1544
01:24:49,882 --> 01:24:52,646
Mother, Jasneet must be tired.

1545
01:24:52,718 --> 01:24:54,208
She's come from so far.

1546
01:24:54,287 --> 01:24:55,754
She's come by flight.

1547
01:24:55,822 --> 01:24:59,121
Yes, it means the same.
Go, Taari. Show her the room.

1548
01:24:59,192 --> 01:25:01,160
Yes, yes. Let's go.

1549
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:06,824
Son, which bus was she talking about?

1550
01:25:07,099 --> 01:25:10,296
The same mini bus in
which you had gone.

1551
01:25:10,403 --> 01:25:12,598
To Malerkotla, to the
Gurusaheb Gurudwara.

1552
01:25:12,705 --> 01:25:15,299
But when did l go to
Gurusaheb Gurudwara?

1553
01:25:15,408 --> 01:25:18,138
Mother, at that time when the
buffalo had come in front of your bus.

1554
01:25:18,744 --> 01:25:21,178
What is there to feel sad about that?

1555
01:25:21,247 --> 01:25:22,839
Your daughter-in-law is from Canada.

1556
01:25:22,915 --> 01:25:25,611
There they consider
animals equal to humans.

1557
01:25:25,818 --> 01:25:27,445
That's why she must have felt sad.

1558
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:32,617
She is so innocent. Anyway, you
have never done a good thing..

1559
01:25:32,692 --> 01:25:36,890
..but by bringing my daughter-in-law
home, you've won my heart, son.

1560
01:25:39,732 --> 01:25:40,892
Bless you.

1561
01:25:44,604 --> 01:25:47,539
Wonder how many more
times l will escape.

1562
01:25:48,374 --> 01:25:49,864
Lord, where are you?

1563
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:56,180
What happened? Why are you crying?

1564
01:25:56,382 --> 01:25:58,009
l'm heartbroken.

1565
01:25:58,217 --> 01:26:00,447
lf you're heartbroken, why
are you chewing sugarcane?

1566
01:26:01,621 --> 01:26:03,919
My heart is broken. My
teeth are not broken.

1567
01:26:04,123 --> 01:26:05,886
l just don't understand you.

1568
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:08,859
Sometimes you climb on the
haystack and sometimes on the tank.

1569
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:10,223
Have you lost your mind?

1570
01:26:10,696 --> 01:26:12,687
Tell me. Why did you call me?

1571
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:19,065
Anmol, first tell me, what does
that Canadian girl have that l don't?

1572
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:22,801
Will Nihaal find a
healthy girl like me?

1573
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:27,608
l'm fair. l have beautiful
features and black hair.

1574
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,547
Tell me. What do l lack,
Anmol? Tell me.

1575
01:26:30,616 --> 01:26:32,982
Silly girl. There's no
comparison between you two.

1576
01:26:33,085 --> 01:26:35,349
Will he get a girl like you?

1577
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:38,652
Forget the sugarcane.
l will do anything.

1578
01:26:38,724 --> 01:26:40,692
But Nihaal should be mine.

1579
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,320
Anmol, l'll tell you what l lack.

1580
01:26:43,396 --> 01:26:46,331
My only drawback is that
l can't speak English..

1581
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:47,866
..like that Canadian girl.

1582
01:26:47,934 --> 01:26:49,094
Yes. You are right.

1583
01:26:49,168 --> 01:26:51,728
Anmol, teach me to talk in English.

1584
01:26:51,804 --> 01:26:52,896
Yes, l'll teach you...
- Will you teach me?

1585
01:26:53,005 --> 01:26:54,666
l'll teach you...

1586
01:26:56,509 --> 01:27:01,742
Heave ho! Heave ho!

1587
01:27:01,814 --> 01:27:03,873
Heave ho!

1588
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:07,044
Oh God!
- Heave ho!

1589
01:27:07,153 --> 01:27:10,054
Heave ho!

1590
01:27:10,523 --> 01:27:15,017
Did you see? Even though it is
spoilt, my father's car runs so fast.

1591
01:27:15,661 --> 01:27:17,891
Heave ho!

1592
01:27:19,432 --> 01:27:22,162
You call this a car? Bloody garbage!

1593
01:27:22,234 --> 01:27:24,395
Hey! Don't call it garbage.

1594
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:27,337
Listen to me. This is the
first car that came to our village.

1595
01:27:27,406 --> 01:27:28,805
My father had brought it.

1596
01:27:28,908 --> 01:27:30,205
After that.. Ford..

1597
01:27:30,276 --> 01:27:32,335
Even today when announcements
are made in the Gurudwara..

1598
01:27:32,445 --> 01:27:33,878
..people know us by this Fiat car.

1599
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:35,572
We feel proud to hear it.

1600
01:27:35,681 --> 01:27:39,412
There is less pride in a man's
turban compared to our Fiat car.

1601
01:27:39,518 --> 01:27:42,954
Stop! Stop! Stop it,
Nihaal! You talk so much.

1602
01:27:45,725 --> 01:27:48,489
Sorry. lf l have spoken
something wrong about you.

1603
01:27:48,561 --> 01:27:49,823
When father was there,
you worked well..

1604
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:51,522
..now when its my turn..
you conked out.

1605
01:27:51,597 --> 01:27:52,825
You can get me humiliated
as much as you want to..

1606
01:27:52,898 --> 01:27:54,092
..but l always respect you.

1607
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:55,326
lt's my father's last memento.

1608
01:27:55,401 --> 01:27:56,925
Nihaal.
- Yes?

1609
01:27:57,603 --> 01:28:00,697
l'm going to Kashmiro. Her
buffalo is sick. - Okay.

1610
01:28:00,773 --> 01:28:04,038
Ask Jasneet to cook
food before l return.

1611
01:28:09,682 --> 01:28:13,083
Food? Forget it, mother. Why does
she need to cook? l'm not hungry.

1612
01:28:13,185 --> 01:28:15,847
l suggest you also eat at
aunt Kashmiro's house. - Why?

1613
01:28:15,955 --> 01:28:17,923
Why should l eat at
someone else's house?

1614
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:19,480
Their buffalo is sick.

1615
01:28:19,592 --> 01:28:22,026
This is strange, mother. Will
the buffalo knead the dough?

1616
01:28:22,128 --> 01:28:23,390
Can't aunt serve you a meal?

1617
01:28:23,496 --> 01:28:25,430
Why are you talking nonsense, Nihaal?

1618
01:28:25,531 --> 01:28:27,658
l will come home and eat.

1619
01:28:28,401 --> 01:28:31,302
Then today my mother will
eat from Jimmy's restaurant.

1620
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:33,429
Their cottage cheese is so delicious.

1621
01:28:34,173 --> 01:28:36,835
Just forget about it.
- l don't want to eat cottage cheese.

1622
01:28:36,909 --> 01:28:38,604
Today l want to eat the flatbreads..

1623
01:28:38,677 --> 01:28:40,304
..and lentil prepared
by my daughter-in-law.

1624
01:28:42,848 --> 01:28:44,611
You can eat the
flatbreads and lentil, mother.

1625
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:47,785
But get for me the medicine to
cure the sick buffalo. l'll have that.

1626
01:28:48,287 --> 01:28:49,447
Jasneet.

1627
01:28:49,522 --> 01:28:51,615
Tell me something.
- Ask.

1628
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:52,782
What do you like to do?

1629
01:28:53,092 --> 01:28:55,356
You mean hobbies?
- Yes.

1630
01:28:55,528 --> 01:29:00,192
Oh. Long drives, adventure sports,
music, world travel... - No, no.

1631
01:29:00,266 --> 01:29:02,734
Household hobbies.
- Household?

1632
01:29:02,935 --> 01:29:06,098
Kneading the dough, making rolls,
making flatbreads.

1633
01:29:07,206 --> 01:29:10,869
l hate cooking! l don't
even know the 'C' of cooking.

1634
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:12,500
l just know to eat.

1635
01:29:12,578 --> 01:29:14,603
Forget about making flatbreads,
l have never even been..

1636
01:29:14,713 --> 01:29:15,873
..to the kitchen before.

1637
01:29:15,948 --> 01:29:17,381
Then l'll show you the kitchen today.

1638
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:20,317
Forgive me, Nihaal. l
don't want to see the kitchen.

1639
01:29:20,386 --> 01:29:22,286
l'm going on a tour
of the village. Okay?

1640
01:29:22,555 --> 01:29:23,920
Oh. One second.

1641
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:27,626
Tell me something. That tank..
- Who told you about the tank?

1642
01:29:28,127 --> 01:29:30,061
No one told me. l'm going to see it.

1643
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:33,958
Don't go to see it.
This tank is troublesome.

1644
01:29:35,134 --> 01:29:36,897
Wonder what nonsense you talk.

1645
01:29:38,604 --> 01:29:40,003
Now who will cook the food?

1646
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,200
Taari.

1647
01:29:43,242 --> 01:29:44,834
Come on, burn up.

1648
01:29:45,578 --> 01:29:48,012
Taari. Taari.

1649
01:29:49,248 --> 01:29:50,806
The flatbread is ready.

1650
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:55,045
Yes.
- Look. The flatbread is made.

1651
01:29:55,387 --> 01:29:57,947
You start the work of twisted sweets.
- Why?

1652
01:29:58,057 --> 01:29:59,991
You have made the
flatbread like twisted sweets.

1653
01:30:00,292 --> 01:30:02,260
l'll make it again.

1654
01:30:02,328 --> 01:30:03,454
This is not your love letter..

1655
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:04,826
..that you can keep
tearing and throwing away.

1656
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:08,559
lt's food. lt's our bread.
Ask for forgiveness.

1657
01:30:08,634 --> 01:30:09,794
Did you clean the lentils?

1658
01:30:09,869 --> 01:30:12,736
lf you don't clean it, l will be dead.

1659
01:30:12,805 --> 01:30:15,467
That will be easier to do. lt
will be done in five minutes.

1660
01:30:15,574 --> 01:30:16,939
l don't understand whether
the dirt is in the lentils..

1661
01:30:17,042 --> 01:30:18,475
..or the lentils are in the dirt.

1662
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:19,738
You know what..

1663
01:30:19,812 --> 01:30:22,975
Forget all this. Let's take
your mother to the Gurudwara.

1664
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:26,550
Half of your idea is good.

1665
01:30:26,619 --> 01:30:28,246
How? - We won't take
mother to the Gurudwara.

1666
01:30:28,354 --> 01:30:30,914
lnstead, we'll get food
from the Gurudwara. - Yes!

1667
01:30:31,123 --> 01:30:34,149
Taste this, mother. Your
daughter-in-law has made this herself.

1668
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:35,853
With her lovely hands.

1669
01:30:35,961 --> 01:30:37,792
What nonsense.

1670
01:30:37,863 --> 01:30:39,387
Mother, she has gone out.

1671
01:30:39,498 --> 01:30:41,796
But she wanted me to
ask you if you liked it.

1672
01:30:41,867 --> 01:30:43,061
ls it good?

1673
01:30:45,504 --> 01:30:48,598
My daughter-in-law is blessed.
- Thank God.

1674
01:30:48,674 --> 01:30:51,643
The lentil is delicious. Just
as they make at the Gurudwara.

1675
01:30:51,744 --> 01:30:53,837
l feel like sitting on the
floor and eating. - Oh God.

1676
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:55,477
You have to sit on
the floor and eat it.

1677
01:30:55,748 --> 01:30:57,079
We have brought it from the Gurudwara.

1678
01:30:57,550 --> 01:30:59,814
What nonsense are you talking?
What if mother had heard you?

1679
01:30:59,885 --> 01:31:02,445
You don't know how much trouble l
had to face to get the food. - Why?

1680
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:04,489
That guy was after me all the time.

1681
01:31:04,557 --> 01:31:05,751
He said you can eat
as much as you want..

1682
01:31:05,824 --> 01:31:07,519
..but you can't take it home.
Then how did you get it?

1683
01:31:07,593 --> 01:31:08,890
The same old idea.
- Which one?

1684
01:31:08,994 --> 01:31:10,586
l told him..
- What?

1685
01:31:10,663 --> 01:31:14,064
The same thing, l said, My younger
brother is hungry since two days.

1686
01:31:14,166 --> 01:31:15,292
Please give me food.

1687
01:31:30,849 --> 01:31:32,612
Who has come?

1688
01:31:33,919 --> 01:31:35,819
She is too good.

1689
01:31:35,888 --> 01:31:37,378
Thank God we put the wood down.

1690
01:31:37,623 --> 01:31:39,215
Otherwise she would burn everything.

1691
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:40,758
Oh gosh!

1692
01:31:41,594 --> 01:31:44,961
Excuse me. l want to meet Nihaal.
- What?

1693
01:31:45,764 --> 01:31:47,459
l'm here to meet Nihaal.

1694
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,497
l didn't recognize you.

1695
01:31:50,603 --> 01:31:54,699
l'm Simrat. Nihaal and l
know each other from Canada.

1696
01:31:55,107 --> 01:31:56,199
Oh!
- Yes.

1697
01:31:56,275 --> 01:31:57,833
So you have come from Mr. Tindsa?

1698
01:31:57,910 --> 01:32:00,504
Yes, yes. That one.
- He is my uncle.

1699
01:32:00,579 --> 01:32:01,671
l see.
- Yes.

1700
01:32:01,747 --> 01:32:03,681
l had plans of going to Canada too.

1701
01:32:03,849 --> 01:32:06,545
l was stuck in some problem.

1702
01:32:06,752 --> 01:32:08,777
So l could not come.

1703
01:32:08,854 --> 01:32:11,687
Next year l will
surely come to Canada.

1704
01:32:12,391 --> 01:32:15,326
What else?
- What are you doing?

1705
01:32:15,394 --> 01:32:16,486
You..
- Get lost.

1706
01:32:16,595 --> 01:32:17,721
Simrat...
- Hi, Nihaal.

1707
01:32:18,297 --> 01:32:19,992
What's this?

1708
01:32:20,266 --> 01:32:21,665
Have you ever been abroad?

1709
01:32:22,234 --> 01:32:24,293
This is how they greet each other.
- Really?

1710
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:27,539
Then whatever happens,
l will go abroad.

1711
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,232
You will sell the forts?

1712
01:32:29,341 --> 01:32:30,706
We don't have so many.

1713
01:32:30,909 --> 01:32:33,878
Come, Simrat. Let's go
there and talk. Come.

1714
01:32:34,913 --> 01:32:37,905
What's this?
- Stop this sometimes.

1715
01:32:38,017 --> 01:32:39,484
And cover this and keep.

1716
01:32:40,886 --> 01:32:43,548
They were watching Mithu's
parents film, after the marriage.

1717
01:32:43,656 --> 01:32:45,248
Now l have decided for sure.

1718
01:32:45,424 --> 01:32:48,188
l won't go back to Canada.
l'll stay here.

1719
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:49,522
That's great.
- Hey!

1720
01:32:49,995 --> 01:32:52,395
l have someone. We
will sell her passport.

1721
01:32:52,464 --> 01:32:56,560
ln 25 lakhs. We will make
5 lakhs. l mean 4 lakhs.

1722
01:32:56,769 --> 01:32:59,397
Why?
- We have to give 1 lakh to another.

1723
01:32:59,638 --> 01:33:01,572
We have to give his money.

1724
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:03,005
Looks like the game will change.

1725
01:33:03,609 --> 01:33:05,941
But l have a problem, Nihaal.
- What?

1726
01:33:06,011 --> 01:33:09,139
l don't understand
how to face my parents.

1727
01:33:09,214 --> 01:33:12,843
They think that l am coming
back with their son-in-law.

1728
01:33:12,951 --> 01:33:15,385
Just tell them the truth.
What's the big deal?

1729
01:33:15,454 --> 01:33:18,912
They'll be upset for a few days.
Then they will be fine. - Yes.

1730
01:33:19,158 --> 01:33:21,558
That's why l've come
straight to you from the airport.

1731
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:23,890
Please come with me and appease them.

1732
01:33:24,196 --> 01:33:26,164
Please explain to them. Please.

1733
01:33:26,265 --> 01:33:27,391
Hey!
- l..

1734
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,297
Don't tell the truth.

1735
01:33:29,368 --> 01:33:33,429
Last time when you spoke the truth,
the teacher had hit Mithu.

1736
01:33:33,505 --> 01:33:35,097
Mithu is in coma till now.

1737
01:33:35,207 --> 01:33:37,835
Please, Nihaal. l have full
confidence in your talent.

1738
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:42,770
You would say that wherever
you go, you impress everyone.

1739
01:33:43,015 --> 01:33:45,506
Nihaal, come. Please.

1740
01:33:47,086 --> 01:33:48,553
Please.

1741
01:33:49,121 --> 01:33:51,817
Tell lies.
- Please, Nihaal. Please.

1742
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:53,152
Lies, lies.

1743
01:33:55,427 --> 01:33:59,659
l think you are lighter in
front of the girl. Get lost.

1744
01:33:59,732 --> 01:34:00,892
Lies.

1745
01:34:02,034 --> 01:34:04,229
You will get us killed. Tell lies.

1746
01:34:04,303 --> 01:34:06,362
Rascals, you have
trying to become leaders.

1747
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:09,669
Come on, you all talk nonsense.
l don't like them.

1748
01:34:09,742 --> 01:34:11,767
Uneducated people.
Uneducated Village Council.

1749
01:34:11,844 --> 01:34:13,835
He changes too fast.

1750
01:34:13,946 --> 01:34:15,937
And when he tries too
smart he is beaten up.

1751
01:34:16,014 --> 01:34:17,140
And then he will come to us.

1752
01:34:17,216 --> 01:34:20,083
Now in this matter we
will check out the motor.

1753
01:34:20,152 --> 01:34:23,053
Bring the CD of your
parents marriage. Okay?

1754
01:34:23,122 --> 01:34:26,683
My turn! My turn! My turn!

1755
01:34:26,759 --> 01:34:30,126
l will beat you.
- My turn!

1756
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:31,423
lt was my turn.

1757
01:34:31,663 --> 01:34:33,187
Give me two marbles.

1758
01:34:33,298 --> 01:34:36,233
Nihaal, l'm very nervous.

1759
01:34:36,335 --> 01:34:38,565
l don't understand
how to face my family.

1760
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:40,865
lt's your family. There's
nothing to be scared about.

1761
01:34:42,708 --> 01:34:44,005
Sister Simrat is here!

1762
01:34:44,109 --> 01:34:45,667
Sister Simrat is here!

1763
01:34:45,778 --> 01:34:47,678
Sister Simrat is here!
- These are all yours.

1764
01:34:47,746 --> 01:34:49,043
Sister Simrat is here!

1765
01:34:49,148 --> 01:34:50,911
Sister Simrat is here!
- Sister Simrat is here!

1766
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:52,712
Sister Simrat is here!
- Sister Simrat is here!

1767
01:34:52,818 --> 01:34:55,150
Sister Simrat is here!
- Simrat!

1768
01:35:00,759 --> 01:35:03,489
Hey, mother has become emotional.

1769
01:35:04,129 --> 01:35:05,494
Where is father?

1770
01:35:17,276 --> 01:35:18,436
What are you looking at?

1771
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:19,807
Where are you going?

1772
01:35:20,512 --> 01:35:22,139
What is this?
- Hand.

1773
01:35:22,247 --> 01:35:23,612
l will hit you.

1774
01:35:23,682 --> 01:35:27,516
Brother-in-law.
Brother-in-law is here!

1775
01:35:27,786 --> 01:35:29,253
Whose brother-in-law?
- You.

1776
01:35:47,539 --> 01:35:48,699
Mother, one minute!

1777
01:35:58,250 --> 01:35:59,376
Hold on!

1778
01:36:03,555 --> 01:36:04,749
You're back?

1779
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:07,820
Who is this?
- Father.

1780
01:36:07,893 --> 01:36:09,485
l didn't expect this from you.

1781
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:13,789
You didn't bother to consult
your father before doing all this?

1782
01:36:13,866 --> 01:36:16,767
He looks angry. Does
your father have a gun?

1783
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:22,904
Son, she is a kid, but you
should have spoken to us.

1784
01:36:22,975 --> 01:36:25,443
You're misunderstanding.
l'll explain everything to you.

1785
01:36:25,511 --> 01:36:27,342
There's nothing to explain.

1786
01:36:27,613 --> 01:36:30,309
l know that people go
abroad and get busy.

1787
01:36:30,682 --> 01:36:33,845
But you could have
at least called once.

1788
01:36:35,487 --> 01:36:38,388
A son-in-law is like a son.

1789
01:36:38,757 --> 01:36:41,385
At least you should have
fulfilled your responsibility.

1790
01:36:41,493 --> 01:36:43,427
But father, it's nothing..
- Listen.

1791
01:36:43,495 --> 01:36:45,122
Don't be so angry.

1792
01:36:45,197 --> 01:36:48,132
Are we away from each other?
Come on. Embrace him.

1793
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:51,658
Come on.
- l had so many desires to see him.

1794
01:36:52,037 --> 01:36:54,028
My son-in-law!

1795
01:36:54,907 --> 01:36:57,239
Swear on God, you are so handsome.

1796
01:37:03,849 --> 01:37:06,784
l'm so happy to see such a nice boy.

1797
01:37:06,852 --> 01:37:09,446
Do one thing. - l feel like
hitting you. - Come. Come.

1798
01:37:09,555 --> 01:37:13,047
We need to take a family
photo with our son-in-law!

1799
01:37:14,526 --> 01:37:19,361
Jasneet! Jasneet dear, listen to me!

1800
01:37:20,532 --> 01:37:21,624
Yes, mother?

1801
01:37:22,935 --> 01:37:24,926
Mother, what's this?

1802
01:37:25,037 --> 01:37:28,302
Dear, this is our ancestral bangles.
- What do you mean?

1803
01:37:28,407 --> 01:37:32,639
l mean, when Nihaal's grandma
got married into this family..

1804
01:37:32,778 --> 01:37:35,144
..Nihaal's
great-grandmother gave these to her.

1805
01:37:35,347 --> 01:37:37,076
When l got married into this family..

1806
01:37:37,215 --> 01:37:39,342
..Nihaal's grandma gave these to me.

1807
01:37:39,451 --> 01:37:41,316
Now l want to give these to you.

1808
01:37:41,553 --> 01:37:45,546
But why do you want to gift
your ancestral bangles to me?

1809
01:37:45,657 --> 01:37:46,988
Dear, gift?

1810
01:37:47,559 --> 01:37:49,550
You're going to be my daughter-in-law.

1811
01:37:49,695 --> 01:37:50,992
l have to give these to you.

1812
01:37:51,129 --> 01:37:52,960
You'll give these to your
daughter-in-law in the future.

1813
01:37:53,098 --> 01:37:54,463
l didn't get you.

1814
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:57,125
Dear, you've been brought up abroad.

1815
01:37:57,235 --> 01:37:59,760
You won't understand our traditions.

1816
01:37:59,905 --> 01:38:03,306
l want Nihaal and you to get married.

1817
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:11,677
What? Nihaal and my marriage?

1818
01:38:11,817 --> 01:38:14,718
Look, dear, this is
not America or Canada..

1819
01:38:14,853 --> 01:38:17,845
..where a boy and a girl can live
together without getting married.

1820
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:19,855
You'll have to get married here.

1821
01:38:19,958 --> 01:38:22,722
'That means Nihaal has
brought me here by lying to me.'

1822
01:38:22,861 --> 01:38:24,226
'That my life is in danger.'

1823
01:38:24,363 --> 01:38:26,490
'Here my full family is in danger.'

1824
01:38:26,632 --> 01:38:28,793
What's the matter, dear?
Why did you become quiet?

1825
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:33,234
No matter where a Punjabi
girl stays, she is always shy.

1826
01:38:37,609 --> 01:38:39,474
She's such a nice girl.

1827
01:38:39,678 --> 01:38:42,670
Thank You, Lord.

1828
01:38:43,348 --> 01:38:46,317
l can't believe Nihaal cheated me.

1829
01:38:46,518 --> 01:38:49,487
Now l understood why everybody
was calling me 'daughter-in-law'.

1830
01:38:49,621 --> 01:38:52,681
Bloody cheat Nihaal! l don't want
to see your face! Where am l going?

1831
01:38:54,092 --> 01:38:55,616
Where is the airport?

1832
01:39:01,299 --> 01:39:03,358
l don't want to see your face, Nihaal!

1833
01:39:07,472 --> 01:39:08,700
Jasneet?

1834
01:39:08,974 --> 01:39:10,407
What is she doing here?

1835
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:14,976
Stop! Stop!

1836
01:39:20,752 --> 01:39:22,583
Jasneet, where are you
going with your luggage?

1837
01:39:22,721 --> 01:39:25,121
l'm going to hell.
- Okay. So going there.

1838
01:39:25,257 --> 01:39:26,724
Hey, listen. Just stop
your nonsense, okay?

1839
01:39:26,825 --> 01:39:29,350
l've come to know what a big
liar your friend Nihaal is.

1840
01:39:29,494 --> 01:39:31,826
Okay, then. Since you've come to
know, let's sit and talk. Come on.

1841
01:39:31,963 --> 01:39:33,328
Don't touch my suitcase!

1842
01:39:33,465 --> 01:39:36,229
You too are a liar like your friend.

1843
01:39:36,535 --> 01:39:38,230
Our village is filled with liars.

1844
01:39:38,336 --> 01:39:40,065
From the headman to the hen,
everyone is a liar.

1845
01:39:40,172 --> 01:39:41,833
Like the hen so are her children.

1846
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,771
Our village comes first in lying.

1847
01:39:43,909 --> 01:39:47,003
You mean this whole bloody village
of yours is full of liars? - What?

1848
01:39:47,412 --> 01:39:48,811
God, you bloody villagers.
- Strange.

1849
01:39:48,914 --> 01:39:51,849
You guys are so educated,
you understand everything.

1850
01:39:52,117 --> 01:39:55,348
Come on. Let's sit and talk.
- l told you not to touch my suitcase!

1851
01:39:55,487 --> 01:39:57,512
Give your friend
Nihaal a message of mine.

1852
01:39:57,622 --> 01:39:59,954
l'm going back to Canada.
There's no need to come after me.

1853
01:40:00,058 --> 01:40:01,184
Listen to me...

1854
01:40:02,828 --> 01:40:06,264
Jasneet!

1855
01:40:06,798 --> 01:40:09,028
Jasneet, listen to me.
Don't get angry. - Move aside.

1856
01:40:09,134 --> 01:40:10,328
At least listen to me.

1857
01:40:10,435 --> 01:40:11,993
Give the suitcase to me. Listen to me.

1858
01:40:12,104 --> 01:40:14,197
Don't get angry.
Let's go home, Jasneet.

1859
01:40:14,339 --> 01:40:16,534
Jasneet, don't do this.
- l'm going.

1860
01:40:16,675 --> 01:40:18,006
Driver, let's go!

1861
01:40:18,143 --> 01:40:20,737
Sony! Don't take money,
she is our guest.

1862
01:40:20,846 --> 01:40:22,507
l will pay for the ride.

1863
01:40:22,614 --> 01:40:24,582
Okay, take the money, l
will settle accounts with you.

1864
01:40:24,716 --> 01:40:27,150
Here's a return gift for Nihaal!

1865
01:40:27,385 --> 01:40:29,615
Hey, come up.

1866
01:40:29,888 --> 01:40:31,856
What is your name?
- Sunny.

1867
01:40:32,524 --> 01:40:34,219
You are a real troublemaker.

1868
01:40:34,359 --> 01:40:36,827
Will have to show your
horoscope to the priest.

1869
01:40:36,962 --> 01:40:38,327
Listen to me.

1870
01:40:38,597 --> 01:40:40,030
Beware of me.

1871
01:40:40,132 --> 01:40:42,191
l am very mean.

1872
01:40:44,302 --> 01:40:45,462
Taari?

1873
01:40:47,272 --> 01:40:48,967
Nihaal.
- Yes, Taari.

1874
01:40:49,107 --> 01:40:50,472
You are doomed.

1875
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:52,870
What happened? - You will
also have to climb the tank.

1876
01:40:52,978 --> 01:40:54,172
Will you tell me what has happened?

1877
01:40:54,312 --> 01:40:55,540
Jasneet was roaming
about with her suitcase..

1878
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,977
..and she just sat
in the tempo and left.

1879
01:40:57,115 --> 01:40:58,207
She has come to know everything.

1880
01:40:58,350 --> 01:41:00,443
She says there is no other
liar in this world like Nihaal.

1881
01:41:00,552 --> 01:41:02,076
What?
- Yes.

1882
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:06,982
Wait, wait.

1883
01:41:09,594 --> 01:41:10,822
Why are you sitting here, Jasneet?

1884
01:41:10,929 --> 01:41:12,055
Take your suitcase. Let's go home.

1885
01:41:12,197 --> 01:41:14,358
l won't go to a liar's house.
- Liar?

1886
01:41:14,466 --> 01:41:16,297
lf l have ever lied, then Taari
will die in front of his laptop..

1887
01:41:16,434 --> 01:41:18,698
..and the image of his
corpse will be printed.

1888
01:41:18,804 --> 01:41:22,137
Then why did your mother say
that she knew Nihaal would bring..

1889
01:41:22,274 --> 01:41:23,935
..a daughter-in-law like an angel?

1890
01:41:28,747 --> 01:41:30,806
What do l tell you about my story?

1891
01:41:30,916 --> 01:41:33,180
l loved a girl whose name was Simrat.

1892
01:41:33,485 --> 01:41:34,850
She left me and went to Canada.

1893
01:41:34,953 --> 01:41:36,818
At mother's behest, l
followed her to Canada.

1894
01:41:37,055 --> 01:41:38,488
After going there, l didn't find her.

1895
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:40,057
But l got hired as your bodyguard.

1896
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:41,921
When l brought you to Punjab,
mother thought that..

1897
01:41:42,027 --> 01:41:43,892
..l've brought that girl
who l followed to Canada.

1898
01:41:43,995 --> 01:41:45,087
She thought you were
her daughter-in-law.

1899
01:41:45,197 --> 01:41:46,494
So what should l do?

1900
01:41:46,798 --> 01:41:48,129
lt's your problem. You handle it.

1901
01:41:48,233 --> 01:41:50,360
Please adjust.
- l won't adjust.

1902
01:41:50,468 --> 01:41:52,299
You should have thought
about all this before.

1903
01:41:52,604 --> 01:41:54,595
l'm not asking you to stay for
too long. Just for a few days..

1904
01:41:54,739 --> 01:41:56,400
l won't adjust. Please leave.

1905
01:41:57,008 --> 01:41:59,704
Listen to me..
- lt's futile. l said just go.

1906
01:42:00,779 --> 01:42:03,179
Try to understand..
- l said just go!

1907
01:42:06,618 --> 01:42:10,611
Look.. - l said just go! - Just
once.. - Just get lost! Go away!

1908
01:42:12,657 --> 01:42:13,885
Hello.

1909
01:42:17,796 --> 01:42:20,458
Let's go.
- Ask her again. She may agree

1910
01:42:20,565 --> 01:42:22,260
You ask her! Let's go!

1911
01:42:24,703 --> 01:42:26,193
Everyone wants to become a boss.

1912
01:42:29,641 --> 01:42:31,108
Mother..

1913
01:42:33,078 --> 01:42:34,909
Praise the Lord.

1914
01:42:35,847 --> 01:42:36,973
Yes, son. Tell me.

1915
01:42:37,115 --> 01:42:39,413
Mother, l wanted to
tell you something.

1916
01:42:39,551 --> 01:42:41,109
What do you want to say, son?

1917
01:42:41,253 --> 01:42:46,054
Mother, l was thinking of
taking you to the Gurudwara.

1918
01:42:46,191 --> 01:42:48,955
That's a great thought, son.

1919
01:42:49,094 --> 01:42:51,927
Let the day get better, then we'll go.

1920
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:54,430
We'll take Jasneet along too.

1921
01:42:54,766 --> 01:42:59,135
Mother, actually.. l
wanted to talk to you about her.

1922
01:42:59,237 --> 01:43:02,001
Tell me. - We'll have to
leave the village, mother.

1923
01:43:02,107 --> 01:43:04,234
Why? Where do you want
to go leaving the village?

1924
01:43:04,342 --> 01:43:07,971
We'll go to Chandigarh, mother.

1925
01:43:08,113 --> 01:43:10,343
There are a lot of
facilities over there.

1926
01:43:10,482 --> 01:43:13,542
Rose Garden, Sector 17, PGl is nearby.

1927
01:43:13,652 --> 01:43:15,347
There's a very big
Gurudwara over there too, mother.

1928
01:43:15,453 --> 01:43:16,818
You can pay homage
whenever you feel like.

1929
01:43:16,955 --> 01:43:20,220
Sure. Now that your wife
has come from Canada..

1930
01:43:20,358 --> 01:43:22,292
..you won't like it in the village.

1931
01:43:22,394 --> 01:43:24,760
Mother, l wanted to
talk to you about that.

1932
01:43:26,298 --> 01:43:31,634
The girl from Canada..
she.. actually.. Thank you.

1933
01:43:31,903 --> 01:43:33,131
She...

1934
01:43:35,941 --> 01:43:37,909
Hello.

1935
01:43:43,949 --> 01:43:46,611
Son, what were you saying
about the girl from Canada?

1936
01:43:46,718 --> 01:43:50,085
Yes, mother. This girl from
Canada makes very good tea.

1937
01:43:50,221 --> 01:43:52,781
Mind blowing tea.

1938
01:43:53,925 --> 01:43:55,722
Okay, tell me something.

1939
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:58,586
Nihaal, do you really
want to shift to Chandigarh?

1940
01:43:58,730 --> 01:44:00,163
l was just joking.

1941
01:44:00,265 --> 01:44:01,357
Who wants to go to Chandigarh?

1942
01:44:01,466 --> 01:44:03,400
Too much noise and pollution.

1943
01:44:03,501 --> 01:44:05,469
The greenery in the
village is something else.

1944
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:08,403
Beautiful flowers
blossom here these days.

1945
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:13,943
Roop, don't worry.

1946
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:16,411
l'm fine here. l'll be safe, really.

1947
01:44:17,015 --> 01:44:19,279
lt's just a matter of a few days.

1948
01:44:20,352 --> 01:44:22,616
l miss you too. Bye.

1949
01:44:26,391 --> 01:44:29,326
Jasneet, l can't repay
you even by giving my life.

1950
01:44:29,594 --> 01:44:30,686
Really?

1951
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:33,730
lf l were the king of Nabba..

1952
01:44:33,865 --> 01:44:37,062
..l would have gifted my
expensive pearl necklace to you.

1953
01:44:37,535 --> 01:44:40,868
But right now l only have a hug.

1954
01:44:41,906 --> 01:44:43,897
And l think that
will not match with you.

1955
01:44:44,676 --> 01:44:46,143
Don't do too much drama.

1956
01:44:46,378 --> 01:44:47,902
You are a liar.

1957
01:44:48,546 --> 01:44:49,774
Thank you.

1958
01:44:50,782 --> 01:44:53,410
But l respect people who love.

1959
01:44:53,685 --> 01:44:56,381
Only respect. Don't love.

1960
01:44:57,789 --> 01:45:00,952
What? - What's my fault
if l didn't get my love?

1961
01:45:02,293 --> 01:45:05,262
l am also feeling bad that
you did not get your love.

1962
01:45:05,363 --> 01:45:06,489
Really.

1963
01:45:06,798 --> 01:45:09,323
Only fortunate people
like you get their love.

1964
01:45:09,768 --> 01:45:11,395
That's true.

1965
01:45:12,103 --> 01:45:15,595
l feel so lucky. Roop loves me a lot.

1966
01:45:16,441 --> 01:45:17,601
And l love him too.

1967
01:45:18,443 --> 01:45:20,707
Oh, God. l can't wait to see him.

1968
01:45:20,845 --> 01:45:24,872
Be happy. Prosper. Always be
around your near and dear ones.

1969
01:45:25,016 --> 01:45:26,506
Okay. Don't do this drama.

1970
01:45:26,918 --> 01:45:29,751
My life is spent doing dramas.

1971
01:45:30,121 --> 01:45:31,679
Mr. Drama..

1972
01:45:31,923 --> 01:45:34,858
Whatever l'm doing is
only for mother's sake.

1973
01:45:35,593 --> 01:45:37,857
Because l can't see her sad.

1974
01:45:42,033 --> 01:45:43,864
Take care of mother.

1975
01:45:44,002 --> 01:45:47,460
Even if mother's son is dying.

1976
01:45:49,941 --> 01:45:56,870
The driver has to go on the road.

1977
01:45:57,015 --> 01:46:00,041
ls this safe?
- Safe? What are you talking?

1978
01:46:00,185 --> 01:46:03,586
The women of our village take
three children on the tractor..

1979
01:46:03,721 --> 01:46:05,120
..and knit sweaters.

1980
01:46:05,256 --> 01:46:07,622
And they hold the wool
rolls under their armpit too.

1981
01:46:07,759 --> 01:46:09,124
They are never hurt.

1982
01:46:09,194 --> 01:46:12,095
Don't get scared, Jasneet Kaur.

1983
01:46:12,197 --> 01:46:15,792
Don't worry. This is safer than a BMW.

1984
01:46:16,367 --> 01:46:17,834
Reached.

1985
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:21,234
Finally! Safe landing.

1986
01:46:24,742 --> 01:46:26,300
So much dust.

1987
01:46:27,045 --> 01:46:28,672
l will change my clothes and come.

1988
01:46:29,781 --> 01:46:32,807
Keep changing your clothes,
don't change your mind.

1989
01:46:33,051 --> 01:46:36,077
Nihaal! Listen to me!
- Yes?

1990
01:46:36,588 --> 01:46:40,080
Kashmiro's buffalo died.
l'm going to the funeral.

1991
01:46:40,291 --> 01:46:43,556
You're going to aunt's
house again. God bless me.

1992
01:46:44,129 --> 01:46:47,929
What did you say? - l said.. may
the buffalo's soul rest in peace.

1993
01:46:48,066 --> 01:46:50,500
l pray it gets a place
in heaven. Go, mother.

1994
01:46:50,635 --> 01:46:51,727
Do one thing.

1995
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:56,273
Ask Jasneet to wash the
clothes that are kept on the couch.

1996
01:47:02,046 --> 01:47:05,106
Really? The clothes
have to be washed? - Yes.

1997
01:47:05,383 --> 01:47:07,908
l mean, do the clothes have to
be just washed or dried too?

1998
01:47:08,052 --> 01:47:10,043
Let's put them in the washing
machine. They'll get dried too.

1999
01:47:10,188 --> 01:47:12,383
Son, how can we put them
in the washing machine?

2000
01:47:12,524 --> 01:47:14,116
lt's not been working since so long.

2001
01:47:14,225 --> 01:47:16,193
Mother, the detergent is over.
We'll wash them tomorrow.

2002
01:47:16,327 --> 01:47:19,728
No, son. Everything is there. Bye.

2003
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:23,862
Lord, give me the wooden bat.

2004
01:47:24,669 --> 01:47:26,967
l should be able to use it.

2005
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,867
lt's so difficult to wash clothes.

2006
01:47:34,245 --> 01:47:38,511
All will be washed white.

2007
01:47:39,884 --> 01:47:41,852
She has come to make fun of me.

2008
01:47:44,422 --> 01:47:45,889
You are washing clothes?

2009
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:47,981
No. They've fallen unconscious.

2010
01:47:48,126 --> 01:47:50,219
l'm dipping them in water
and making them conscious.

2011
01:47:50,328 --> 01:47:52,057
You had gone to change.

2012
01:47:52,297 --> 01:47:54,231
l changed my mind.

2013
01:47:54,465 --> 01:47:57,025
Don't do it with me.
- What? - Nothing.

2014
01:47:57,135 --> 01:47:59,103
Listen, should l help you?

2015
01:47:59,237 --> 01:48:01,228
Yes, you can. Absolutely.

2016
01:48:01,372 --> 01:48:02,634
Pick that.

2017
01:48:03,775 --> 01:48:05,174
The wooden stick.

2018
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:07,505
l mean this bat.

2019
01:48:07,645 --> 01:48:11,979
Oh. This bat.
- Yes. Now hit that cloth.

2020
01:48:16,154 --> 01:48:17,485
Don't do that.

2021
01:48:17,622 --> 01:48:19,214
You said hit it.
- Let it be.

2022
01:48:19,357 --> 01:48:20,949
Do one thing. Pick the water pipe.

2023
01:48:21,059 --> 01:48:24,028
Tell me where the stains are.

2024
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:28,399
There are stains on your
face too. Shall l wash it?

2025
01:48:28,533 --> 01:48:29,727
Really?

2026
01:49:03,801 --> 01:49:07,737
Careful, madam. Your spare
parts are not available here.

2027
01:49:10,475 --> 01:49:12,670
Hello.
- Nihaal, come quickly.

2028
01:49:12,777 --> 01:49:15,439
l still have to wash
mother's veil and two vests of mine.

2029
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:17,172
ldiot! Forget the veil and the vests.

2030
01:49:17,282 --> 01:49:19,546
Father's friend is coming
home in the evening to meet you.

2031
01:49:19,651 --> 01:49:22,745
Just come quickly.
- ls it? l'm coming right away.

2032
01:49:29,193 --> 01:49:33,061
Nihaal, Amreek is a very
old friend of mine. - Okay.

2033
01:49:33,264 --> 01:49:35,664
He's his son Samar.
- Hello. - How are you?

2034
01:49:35,933 --> 01:49:38,094
Take this, dear.
Serve this to everyone.

2035
01:49:38,202 --> 01:49:40,033
Come on. Let's cook food.

2036
01:49:40,238 --> 01:49:43,730
Wow, Jarnail. Our
kids have grown so big.

2037
01:49:44,175 --> 01:49:47,906
lt seems like just
recently when we got married.

2038
01:49:57,955 --> 01:50:02,892
By the time they get the food,
you go and chat.

2039
01:50:03,027 --> 01:50:06,724
You're very lucky that you've
got the love of a girl like Simrat.

2040
01:50:07,098 --> 01:50:08,861
Really? Thank you.

2041
01:50:09,367 --> 01:50:12,859
You're marrying the one you desired.

2042
01:50:13,137 --> 01:50:16,300
What else do you want in life?
- You're right.

2043
01:50:16,441 --> 01:50:20,207
The lover feels that l
should take her and fly away.

2044
01:50:20,511 --> 01:50:23,275
Sometimes l feel like
becoming her shadow.

2045
01:50:23,581 --> 01:50:26,482
Sometimes l feel like
making her my shadow.

2046
01:50:27,118 --> 01:50:30,053
Sometimes l feel like
washing clothes with her.

2047
01:50:30,355 --> 01:50:33,017
Sometimes l feel like
putting them to dry.

2048
01:50:33,291 --> 01:50:37,057
One clothes bat in
my hand, one in hers.

2049
01:50:37,562 --> 01:50:40,793
l should hit once,
she should hit once.

2050
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:44,066
They hit us and drive us crazy.

2051
01:50:44,168 --> 01:50:46,898
Don't you think we took the
matter to a different direction?

2052
01:50:47,171 --> 01:50:49,002
l don't know in which
direction the matter has gone.

2053
01:50:49,273 --> 01:50:50,934
But it was fun talking about it.

2054
01:50:51,075 --> 01:50:53,270
So, what were you talking about?

2055
01:50:53,411 --> 01:50:55,402
How are you, Samar?
- l'm fine.

2056
01:50:56,914 --> 01:50:58,643
Okay. l'll leave.

2057
01:51:01,986 --> 01:51:03,578
Since when have you known him?

2058
01:51:04,122 --> 01:51:07,853
Since we were kids. He
was my classmate. But why?

2059
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:09,421
No, l just asked.

2060
01:51:09,861 --> 01:51:11,761
Still, why?

2061
01:51:12,096 --> 01:51:13,461
He loves you.

2062
01:51:14,799 --> 01:51:17,097
You've gone crazy, Nihaal.

2063
01:51:20,805 --> 01:51:22,329
Amazing, Lord.

2064
01:51:22,774 --> 01:51:24,674
You made lovers like that.

2065
01:51:25,777 --> 01:51:28,371
And females like twisted sweets.

2066
01:51:28,513 --> 01:51:32,643
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

2067
01:51:32,784 --> 01:51:35,685
Humpty Dumpty had...

2068
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:38,921
l can't learn this.

2069
01:51:39,023 --> 01:51:41,753
And l can't change
myself for someone else.

2070
01:51:41,893 --> 01:51:44,453
People should like me the way l am.

2071
01:51:44,729 --> 01:51:45,923
Who will like you?

2072
01:51:46,063 --> 01:51:49,760
Since the 4th grade, you've
only been chanting Nihaal's name.

2073
01:51:49,901 --> 01:51:53,337
Anmol, you would notice me
when l was in the 4th grade?

2074
01:51:53,471 --> 01:51:55,166
Yes, l would notice you.

2075
01:51:55,306 --> 01:51:58,935
l beat up two boys in
school because of you. - Why?

2076
01:51:59,243 --> 01:52:01,108
They would call you fat.

2077
01:52:01,245 --> 01:52:04,544
They would call me fat. Why
would you feel bad about it?

2078
01:52:05,116 --> 01:52:06,913
l liked you.

2079
01:52:07,051 --> 01:52:10,020
And now? Don't you like me now?

2080
01:52:11,022 --> 01:52:13,354
l do. l like you even today.

2081
01:52:13,624 --> 01:52:16,855
Anmol, l really like you.

2082
01:52:16,994 --> 01:52:20,521
To hell with Nihaal. l
love you very much, Anmol.

2083
01:52:20,665 --> 01:52:22,496
Hey! You're talking in English.

2084
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:24,932
l always knew this much English.

2085
01:52:25,069 --> 01:52:26,434
Anmol, you tell me.

2086
01:52:26,537 --> 01:52:28,505
You'll marry me, won't you?
- Yes.

2087
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:29,799
You'll marry me, won't you?

2088
01:52:29,907 --> 01:52:32,068
Tell me, Anmol. You'll
marry me, won't you?

2089
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:33,336
You will, won't you, Anmol?
- Yes, l will.

2090
01:52:33,478 --> 01:52:36,242
Or else l'll climb up the
tank and jump! - Yes, l will.

2091
01:52:53,397 --> 01:52:56,230
Discussion about love, and friends.

2092
01:52:56,367 --> 01:52:59,200

They don't back out.

Mother, should l put
the clothes for drying?

Let it be, dear.

2124
01:54:57,555 --> 01:55:00,115
After your marriage, you have to
work for the rest of your life.

2125
01:55:00,591 --> 01:55:05,460
At Anmol's wedding, Nihaal and
you looked very nice as a couple.

2126
01:55:05,997 --> 01:55:07,692
What were you singing?

2127
01:55:07,832 --> 01:55:09,925
Singha. Singha. Singha. Singha.

2128
01:55:10,067 --> 01:55:12,467
Mother! That's not how it was.

2129
01:55:12,737 --> 01:55:13,795
lt was like that.

2130
01:55:13,938 --> 01:55:15,337
Singha. Singha. Singha. Singha.

2131
01:55:15,473 --> 01:55:16,667

Singha. Singha. Singha. Singha.

01:55:21,979 --> 01:55:23,640
Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh.

2135
01:55:25,916 --> 01:55:27,679
Crazy girl!

2136
01:55:28,152 --> 01:55:31,087
Mother, you're very sweet.

2137
01:55:31,222 --> 01:55:33,486
l don't know about sweet.

2138
01:55:33,691 --> 01:55:38,719
l just knew that my future
daughter-in-law would be an angel..

2139
01:55:38,829 --> 01:55:42,094
..when l saw your photo.
- My photo?

2140
01:55:42,233 --> 01:55:46,067
Let alone me, the whole
village had seen your photo, dear.

2141
01:55:46,203 --> 01:55:47,795
The whole village saw my photo?

2142
01:55:47,938 --> 01:55:49,132
Don't you know, dear?

2143
01:55:49,273 --> 01:55:52,470
The headman brought
Sapna's marriage proposal to us.

2144
01:55:52,576 --> 01:55:54,203
Nihaal refused.

2145
01:55:54,311 --> 01:55:56,279
Sapna went and climbed on the tank.

2146
01:55:56,414 --> 01:55:59,474
That's when Nihaal
showed your photo to us.

2147
01:56:03,921 --> 01:56:06,651
This means you saw my
photo before l came here?

2148
01:56:06,757 --> 01:56:09,555
Yes, dear. After seeing your photo..

2149
01:56:09,727 --> 01:56:13,094
..the village forced
Nihaal to bring you here.

2150
01:56:13,197 --> 01:56:17,065
'Nihaal, l trusted
you so much and you..'

2151
01:56:20,838 --> 01:56:23,306
Taari? Hello. Yes, Taari.

2152
01:56:25,376 --> 01:56:26,502
What?

2153
01:56:35,052 --> 01:56:37,680
Where? Hello. Jasneet.

2154
01:56:37,888 --> 01:56:41,324
Where are you going
with your suitcase?

2155
01:56:41,659 --> 01:56:42,956
Hey, stop.

2156
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:45,494
Stop, stop, stop.

2157
01:56:48,299 --> 01:56:49,994
Where are you going?

2158
01:56:50,234 --> 01:56:52,202
Or you want to put up a
photo on the Facebook..

2159
01:56:52,336 --> 01:56:54,634
..going around in the village.

2160
01:56:55,339 --> 01:56:56,806
You know a lot about Facebook!

2161
01:56:56,907 --> 01:56:57,896
You had printed my
photo from Facebook..

2162
01:56:58,042 --> 01:56:59,202
..and shown your mother, isn't it?

2163
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:00,402
That this is your daughter-in-law.

2164
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:02,341
Which photo?
- My photo.

2165
01:57:02,446 --> 01:57:03,913
Mother has told me everything.

2166
01:57:04,048 --> 01:57:06,414
Mother leaks out everything so soon.

2167
01:57:06,517 --> 01:57:08,041
Since mother has told you everything..

2168
01:57:08,185 --> 01:57:10,779
..let me tell you the
remaining truth. - Enough!

2169
01:57:10,921 --> 01:57:12,388
l don't want to hear
any more lies from you.

2170
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:14,617
Don't go by my reputation,
l am telling the truth.

2171
01:57:14,759 --> 01:57:16,920
The villagers wanted me to
get married to such a girl..

2172
01:57:17,061 --> 01:57:18,119
..whom l did not love at all.

2173
01:57:18,262 --> 01:57:20,253
Taari printed your photo from
the lnternet and showed them.

2174
01:57:20,397 --> 01:57:22,922
Then l came to Canada, you
know the remaining story better.

2175
01:57:23,033 --> 01:57:24,466
Hello. Let's go home.

2176
01:57:24,568 --> 01:57:26,593
Just shut up. How dare you..

2177
01:57:26,704 --> 01:57:29,070
To solve your own problem,
you used me?

2178
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:30,773
No, no. lt's not that.

2179
01:57:30,908 --> 01:57:32,341
Try to understand. Listen to me.

2180
01:57:32,443 --> 01:57:34,707
Please come home.
What will l tell mother.

2181
01:57:34,845 --> 01:57:36,904
No! Driver, let's go!
- Please.

2182
01:57:37,047 --> 01:57:38,708
l hope your yellow bag does not break.

2183
01:57:38,849 --> 01:57:41,317
l said, no way. Driver, come on.

2184
01:57:41,418 --> 01:57:45,013
Driver, one minute. - Just get
out of my life. Just go away.

2185
01:57:45,322 --> 01:57:48,155
Okay. Don't give him more than Rs 25.

2186
01:57:48,292 --> 01:57:50,089
l will give him Rs 50. Any problem?

2187
01:57:50,227 --> 01:57:54,129
Get lost.
- Take Rs 50. l will adjust 25.

2188
01:57:54,231 --> 01:57:56,699
Driver, move on.
- Take care.

2189
01:57:57,067 --> 01:57:58,295
Coming?

2190
01:58:01,438 --> 01:58:05,374
She is going to Canada. Now
what will l say to mother.

2191
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:08,572
The villagers will
harass us with their taunts.

2192
01:58:09,613 --> 01:58:11,911
The tyre has punctured!

2193
01:58:34,371 --> 01:58:36,202
Nihaal!

2194
01:59:03,634 --> 01:59:05,568
Nihaal!

2195
01:59:20,017 --> 01:59:22,008
Nihaal!

2196
01:59:40,537 --> 01:59:42,232
Only four days are left.

2197
01:59:44,909 --> 01:59:47,434
After four days you
will be 21 years old.

2198
01:59:49,947 --> 01:59:53,041
Till then it is my
duty to save your life.

2199
01:59:57,154 --> 01:59:58,951
Nihaal Singh is not saying this..

2200
02:00:05,229 --> 02:00:06,958
..your bodyguard is saying this.

2201
02:00:10,434 --> 02:00:18,933
Beloved..

2202
02:00:19,476 --> 02:00:25,904
Beloved..

2203
02:00:32,723 --> 02:00:40,528
Beloved..

2204
02:00:41,598 --> 02:00:47,867
Beloved..

2205
02:00:47,972 --> 02:00:51,237
l repent having fallen in love.

2206
02:00:51,342 --> 02:00:54,209
l look forward to meet you.

2207
02:00:54,345 --> 02:00:59,305
Beloved, l look forward.

2208
02:00:59,984 --> 02:01:03,351
l repent having fallen in love.

2209
02:01:03,487 --> 02:01:06,422
l look forward to meet you.

2210
02:01:06,557 --> 02:01:11,790
Beloved, l look forward.

2211
02:01:21,672 --> 02:01:24,539
lt's good, Nihaal, that
you told her the truth.

2212
02:01:24,641 --> 02:01:27,610
She will be 21 years old in 2-4 days.

2213
02:01:27,711 --> 02:01:29,770
Our problem is solved, right?

2214
02:01:30,114 --> 02:01:32,275
You brought the girl
and showed the villagers.

2215
02:01:32,583 --> 02:01:34,813
Mother will also
understand on explaining to her.

2216
02:01:35,719 --> 02:01:38,244
But l don't wish that
Jasneet goes away from here.

2217
02:01:38,856 --> 02:01:42,292
Why? - l did not think
that a lie told by me..

2218
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:45,592
..will become such a
big truth of my life.

2219
02:01:46,296 --> 02:01:48,856
You know, she loves someone else.

2220
02:01:49,266 --> 02:01:51,166
What is the use of thinking of this?

2221
02:01:51,635 --> 02:01:54,297
Love is like this flowing water.

2222
02:01:55,172 --> 02:01:57,072
Which we cannot stop.

2223
02:01:57,941 --> 02:02:00,341
l can't understand your talks.

2224
02:02:01,779 --> 02:02:04,304
God and love cannot be understood.

2225
02:02:04,815 --> 02:02:08,080
lf you want to understand, go
and look into the eyes of Samar.

2226
02:02:08,385 --> 02:02:10,410
Samar? What do you mean?

2227
02:02:11,989 --> 02:02:15,322
The eyes of a real saint
and a true lover speak.

2228
02:02:16,593 --> 02:02:19,619
Go and hold his hand,
your life will be made.

2229
02:02:20,097 --> 02:02:22,327
He will convince your family.

2230
02:02:22,833 --> 02:02:25,563
Lovers know lots of things.

2231
02:02:31,041 --> 02:02:43,078
Praise the Lord.

2232
02:02:47,724 --> 02:02:49,954
'Thank you very much, Lord.'

2233
02:02:50,661 --> 02:02:53,425
'Today in the happiness of the
arrival of my daughter-in-law..'

2234
02:02:53,564 --> 02:02:56,192
'..l kept the Holy Book in
my house and venerated it.'

2235
02:02:57,234 --> 02:03:00,226
'This house is
blessed after many days.'

2236
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:08,568
Nihaal's father, today
l am missing you a lot.

2237
02:03:09,146 --> 02:03:13,583
At this happy moment, if
you were with us, then..

2238
02:03:20,324 --> 02:03:22,884
Mother, what is the matter?
Why are you crying?

2239
02:03:23,127 --> 02:03:27,223
Dear, l am missing
Nihaal's father a lot today.

2240
02:03:27,998 --> 02:03:34,836
When Nihaal was very small, he
left us both alone and passed away.

2241
02:03:36,273 --> 02:03:39,902
Mother, l am sorry..
- No problem, dear.

2242
02:03:40,043 --> 02:03:46,778
After he left us, this is the
first time we have got some happiness.

2243
02:03:47,017 --> 02:03:49,645
Now l just pray to Lord..

2244
02:03:49,786 --> 02:03:52,448
..that no one should cast
an evil eye on this house.

2245
02:03:52,556 --> 02:03:55,650
And you and Nihaal get
married as soon as possible.

2246
02:03:56,093 --> 02:03:58,994
And from today, the
responsibility of Nihaal lies on you.

2247
02:03:59,296 --> 02:04:02,732
Now l desire to play
with my grandchildren.

2248
02:04:02,833 --> 02:04:06,098
And one more thing,
whether it's a boy or girl..

2249
02:04:06,236 --> 02:04:08,033
..it should not be like my Nihaal.

2250
02:04:08,172 --> 02:04:16,272
Beloved..

2251
02:04:17,047 --> 02:04:23,452
Beloved..

2252
02:04:24,721 --> 02:04:30,284
Beloved..

2253
02:04:30,427 --> 02:04:33,328
Beloved..

2254
02:04:33,463 --> 02:04:40,164
Beloved..

2255
02:04:46,443 --> 02:04:54,441
Beloved..

2256
02:04:55,419 --> 02:04:58,946
Beloved..

2257
02:04:59,056 --> 02:05:01,115
What do you think? What do you think?

2258
02:05:01,258 --> 02:05:02,919
What do you think of yourself?

2259
02:05:03,994 --> 02:05:09,296
Do you know, Nihaal, mother has so
many dreams about the two of us.

2260
02:05:10,567 --> 02:05:14,367
l don't have the
strength to break those dreams.

2261
02:05:16,607 --> 02:05:20,373
Who told you to lie to your mother?

2262
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:27,846
Who told you, Nihaal? Who told you?

2263
02:05:46,670 --> 02:05:48,433
l have made a mistake.

2264
02:05:48,705 --> 02:05:53,904
l have lied to all the good
people that God has sent in my life.

2265
02:05:54,978 --> 02:05:57,105
l had lied to you also
and brought you here.

2266
02:05:57,814 --> 02:06:01,875
You forgive me. l will pacify mother.

2267
02:06:02,019 --> 02:06:09,585
Was going towards heaven,
came back half way.

2268
02:06:10,761 --> 02:06:18,668
Did not come to know of the pain,
wonder from where it came.

2269
02:06:19,903 --> 02:06:27,776
You quietly went off to sleep,
the stars in the sky.

2270
02:06:29,346 --> 02:06:35,512
The tiger's heart is hurt,
a deer has wounded it.

2271
02:06:35,619 --> 02:06:41,251
The tiger's heart is hurt,
a deer has wounded it.

2272
02:06:41,391 --> 02:06:44,554
l repent having fallen in love.

2273
02:06:44,661 --> 02:06:47,596
l look forward to meet you.

2274
02:06:47,731 --> 02:06:53,033
Beloved, l look forward.

2275
02:06:53,370 --> 02:06:56,669
l repent having fallen in love.

2276
02:06:56,807 --> 02:06:59,708
l look forward to meet you.

2277
02:06:59,843 --> 02:07:05,304
Beloved, l look forward.

2278
02:07:05,615 --> 02:07:13,021
The heart is broken.

2279
02:07:14,624 --> 02:07:22,156
The problem of the heart,
is slowly increasing.

2280
02:07:24,134 --> 02:07:27,865
The heart is miserable.

2281
02:07:28,271 --> 02:07:31,069
'Mother, l have
always given you sorrow.'

2282
02:07:31,308 --> 02:07:33,538
'l could never become your good son.'

2283
02:07:33,677 --> 02:07:35,872
'But one thing is there
for sure. Your useless son..

2284
02:07:35,979 --> 02:07:37,810
..loves you a lot.'

2285
02:07:39,182 --> 02:07:45,314
The tiger's heart is hurt,
a deer has wounded it.

2286
02:07:45,455 --> 02:07:52,122
The tiger's heart is hurt,
a deer has wounded it.

2287
02:07:54,131 --> 02:08:04,905
Praise the Lord.

2288
02:08:06,943 --> 02:08:09,377
Mother.
- Yes.

2289
02:08:09,646 --> 02:08:14,345
l wanted to ask you something.
- What did you want to ask?

2290
02:08:15,285 --> 02:08:19,221
What is the strongest pillar
between the love of a mother and son?

2291
02:08:19,322 --> 02:08:23,190
What sort of question
is this? Are you okay?

2292
02:08:23,427 --> 02:08:26,988
l am okay, but first
reply to my question.

2293
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:30,691
The strongest pillar
is of love and trust.

2294
02:08:30,801 --> 02:08:33,031
The relationship may be of any sort.

2295
02:08:33,570 --> 02:08:36,266
But what if the pillar breaks, mother?

2296
02:08:36,406 --> 02:08:40,365
lf the pillar breaks then it's
very difficult to patch it together.

2297
02:08:40,477 --> 02:08:43,571
Even if it is patched,
there is always a crack in it.

2298
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:46,012
But if God's blessing is there..

2299
02:08:46,116 --> 02:08:49,210
..then it can be
repaired with forgiveness.

2300
02:08:49,486 --> 02:08:53,513
Then mother, forgive your useless son.

2301
02:08:54,958 --> 02:08:56,619
What happened, Nihaal?

2302
02:08:57,527 --> 02:09:00,155
Mother, l have lied
to you all the time.

2303
02:09:00,297 --> 02:09:04,631
l am not married to Jasneet. l
lied to her and brought her here.

2304
02:09:06,269 --> 02:09:07,736
Nihaal.

2305
02:09:09,239 --> 02:09:10,934
Forgive me, mother.

2306
02:09:11,074 --> 02:09:14,703
Otherwise God will also not
forgive your unfortunate son.

2307
02:09:15,011 --> 02:09:17,502
Your lie has hurt me a lot, son.

2308
02:09:17,981 --> 02:09:20,814
But you have done so much
for your mother's happiness..

2309
02:09:20,917 --> 02:09:23,044
..where does God give
everyone such a son.

2310
02:09:24,054 --> 02:09:25,419
No, son.

2311
02:09:25,722 --> 02:09:27,747
lf you had not lied..

2312
02:09:27,891 --> 02:09:30,860
..l would not have got the
love of a daughter like Jasneet.

2313
02:09:31,194 --> 02:09:34,493
She also did a lot to keep me happy.

2314
02:09:38,768 --> 02:09:42,363
Nihaal's father, forgive Nihaal.

2315
02:09:42,873 --> 02:09:45,637
He lied for my happiness,

2316
02:09:49,746 --> 02:09:52,909
Nihaal has told me
the whole truth, dear.

2317
02:09:53,850 --> 02:09:58,184
lf l have ever spoken rudely
to you, please forgive me, dear.

2318
02:09:58,288 --> 02:10:02,520
Mother, no.. don't say such things.

2319
02:10:03,059 --> 02:10:05,926
ln my whole life, no one
has given me so much love..

2320
02:10:06,062 --> 02:10:10,021
..as you have given me
in such few days. l..

2321
02:10:10,166 --> 02:10:11,497
Jasneet..

2322
02:10:12,702 --> 02:10:14,260
Someone has come to meet you outside.

2323
02:10:38,795 --> 02:10:41,355
Surprise! Here l come!

2324
02:10:42,832 --> 02:10:46,290
Happy birthday to you.

2325
02:10:46,570 --> 02:10:49,971
Happy birthday to you.

2326
02:10:50,106 --> 02:10:53,041
Oh gosh! l missed you so much.

2327
02:10:55,111 --> 02:10:56,738
l love you, my sweetheart.

2328
02:10:58,582 --> 02:11:01,449
What happened? Where are you lost?

2329
02:11:01,585 --> 02:11:03,314
You have forgotten your birthday.

2330
02:11:04,921 --> 02:11:06,149
Jassi?

2331
02:11:08,425 --> 02:11:09,653
Nihaal.

2332
02:11:12,228 --> 02:11:13,889
Nihaal, Roop.

2333
02:11:14,264 --> 02:11:16,129
Hi Nihaal. Nice to meet you.

2334
02:11:16,466 --> 02:11:19,526
Hello. Please bless me.
- Bless you.

2335
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:21,062
Shall we leave?

2336
02:11:22,472 --> 02:11:24,463
Son, you have come for the
first time to our house.

2337
02:11:24,608 --> 02:11:26,166
Have some tea and snacks and go.

2338
02:11:26,276 --> 02:11:27,607
Aunt, thank you very much.

2339
02:11:27,711 --> 02:11:29,474
Actually we are getting very late.

2340
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:31,572
Shall we leave?

2341
02:11:31,715 --> 02:11:33,615
No, you go, l'll come.

2342
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:36,981
Okay, l'll wait near
the car. Okay bye.

2343
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:45,953
Dear, if you come to lndia again,
surely come to meet us.

2344
02:12:04,514 --> 02:12:05,811
Thank you, Nihaal.

2345
02:12:11,988 --> 02:12:15,890
One more thing, always wear a turban.

2346
02:12:16,626 --> 02:12:18,025
You look handsome.

2347
02:12:19,629 --> 02:12:21,028
Roop is waiting for you.

2348
02:12:51,995 --> 02:12:55,328
Thank you so much, Sardar. You
have taken good care of her.

2349
02:12:55,632 --> 02:12:58,567
l say, you also find a
beautiful girl and get married.

2350
02:12:58,668 --> 02:13:00,966
What say, Jassi?
- Don't worry about me.

2351
02:13:01,271 --> 02:13:03,068
Every Sardar gets a girl.

2352
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:06,031
But every girl does not get a Sardar.

2353
02:13:09,279 --> 02:13:11,270
Okay. Shall we go?

2354
02:13:11,514 --> 02:13:12,708
Come, sit.

2355
02:13:26,296 --> 02:13:27,627
Stop the car, Roop.

2356
02:13:36,072 --> 02:13:38,905
What happened, darling?
Why did you get off the car?

2357
02:13:39,008 --> 02:13:40,839
l hope everything is okay?

2358
02:13:41,511 --> 02:13:43,945
Come on, let's go.
- One minute. - What happened?

2359
02:13:47,217 --> 02:13:49,014
l don't want to leave.

2360
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:53,512
l don't know l just don't
want to leave this place and go.

2361
02:13:53,656 --> 02:13:55,180
Have you gone mad?

2362
02:13:55,458 --> 02:13:57,255
l have come from so far to
take you and you are saying..

2363
02:13:57,393 --> 02:13:58,883
..you don't want to leave.

2364
02:14:00,597 --> 02:14:02,497
l don't know what's
wrong with me, Roop.

2365
02:14:03,032 --> 02:14:04,761
l am just confused that..

2366
02:14:06,102 --> 02:14:10,562
All l know is that l don't
want to go back to Canada.

2367
02:14:10,673 --> 02:14:14,632
Just feel l am missing something.
- Excuse me.

2368
02:14:16,012 --> 02:14:18,742
Hello. Look at me.

2369
02:14:20,316 --> 02:14:21,442
Look at me.

2370
02:14:26,122 --> 02:14:28,249
Don't tell me that you
are in love with Nihaal.

2371
02:14:28,825 --> 02:14:31,726
Oh my God! Oh my..!

2372
02:14:31,828 --> 02:14:34,695
Don't tell me you are in
love with Nihaal. Shit.

2373
02:14:36,099 --> 02:14:38,499
You should have
stopped her at least once.

2374
02:14:38,802 --> 02:14:41,464
What's the use? She loves Roop.

2375
02:14:41,571 --> 02:14:43,664
Look Nihaal, you may be mistaken.

2376
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:47,068
About a girl, you can
know whom she is angry with.

2377
02:14:47,343 --> 02:14:50,471
But it's very difficult
to say, whom she loves.

2378
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:51,842
l don't know that.

2379
02:14:52,248 --> 02:14:55,115
l just know that the
one a person loves..

2380
02:14:55,218 --> 02:14:56,981
..you can't break her heart.

2381
02:15:01,624 --> 02:15:03,148
Did Nihaal say anything to you?

2382
02:15:03,693 --> 02:15:06,184
He is a liar. He
does not say anything.

2383
02:15:06,863 --> 02:15:08,490
He just talks nonsense.

2384
02:15:11,968 --> 02:15:15,768
Okay listen to me,
Nihaal is a very nice guy.

2385
02:15:17,073 --> 02:15:21,942
lf you both love each other,
then don't bother about me.

2386
02:15:23,146 --> 02:15:27,082
l will do anything for your
happiness, Jassi. Trust me.

2387
02:15:27,650 --> 02:15:29,345
Thank you so much, Roop.

2388
02:15:30,119 --> 02:15:31,916
Thanks a lot for that.

2389
02:15:32,655 --> 02:15:35,146
Today l am going to tell
your family the whole truth..

2390
02:15:35,258 --> 02:15:37,624
..that l was not the one to
call you to Canada deceivingly.

2391
02:15:37,861 --> 02:15:39,829
l knew this truth earlier, son.

2392
02:15:41,231 --> 02:15:45,133
And l also know that you are
doing all this for our happiness.

2393
02:15:46,069 --> 02:15:48,037
And l had welcomed
you as my son-in-law..

2394
02:15:48,171 --> 02:15:50,696
..for the sake of the
happiness of my family.

2395
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:57,212
But my eyes are still looking for
the guy who deceived my daughter.

2396
02:15:57,313 --> 02:15:58,473
Let it be, father.

2397
02:15:58,615 --> 02:16:00,879
Let me see how much
handsomer he is than me.

2398
02:16:00,984 --> 02:16:02,508
Please.
- Give me.

2399
02:16:02,785 --> 02:16:04,047
l hate him.

2400
02:16:08,625 --> 02:16:13,324
Now to make you and Nihaal meet...

2401
02:16:46,296 --> 02:16:49,788
Roop.
- How do you know Roop?

2402
02:16:49,899 --> 02:16:53,335
He is the same person
who took Jasneet from me.

2403
02:16:54,570 --> 02:16:55,730
Oh no!

2404
02:17:07,116 --> 02:17:09,550
Jasneet don't say anything.
Listen to me carefully.

2405
02:17:09,686 --> 02:17:13,417
Roop is the same person
who destroyed Simrat's life.

2406
02:17:15,525 --> 02:17:17,857
l think the attacks that
were happening on you..

2407
02:17:17,994 --> 02:17:19,484
..he was the one who
was getting them done.

2408
02:18:21,157 --> 02:18:23,091
You.. don't come near me.

2409
02:18:26,796 --> 02:18:30,630
What is the matter,
Jasneet? Why are you so scared?

2410
02:18:30,767 --> 02:18:32,291
These are our own people.

2411
02:18:35,938 --> 02:18:38,805
You.. don't come near me.

2412
02:18:40,610 --> 02:18:45,206
Don't come near you.. me?

2413
02:18:47,617 --> 02:18:49,608
l am your Roop, isn't it?

2414
02:18:50,920 --> 02:18:53,150
Girls don't run away from Roop.

2415
02:18:54,390 --> 02:18:56,722
Roop leaves them.

2416
02:18:57,727 --> 02:18:59,251
You come with me. Come.

2417
02:18:59,395 --> 02:19:01,989
Come with me.
- Roop!

2418
02:19:07,303 --> 02:19:09,328
Why are you laughing? Catch her.

2419
02:19:12,508 --> 02:19:15,909
Nihaal!

2420
02:19:19,949 --> 02:19:21,143
Jasneet..

2421
02:19:22,652 --> 02:19:25,120
Brother, she ran away.

2422
02:19:29,725 --> 02:19:32,888
Don't ask with whom.
She has gone alone.

2423
02:19:33,196 --> 02:19:35,562
But you don't worry.
Don't worry at all.

2424
02:19:36,466 --> 02:19:38,696
l have sent my men behind her.

2425
02:19:48,010 --> 02:19:50,240
l say, you also come.

2426
02:19:51,314 --> 02:19:52,508
We will look for her together.

2427
02:19:52,615 --> 02:19:55,778
lf anything happens to Jasneet..
- Don't shout..

2428
02:19:56,352 --> 02:19:59,685
Till today you were saving her
because l did not want to kill her.

2429
02:20:00,289 --> 02:20:02,450
But today l will surely kill her.

2430
02:20:03,493 --> 02:20:06,826
lf Singh has the guts, save your Kaur.

2431
02:20:15,371 --> 02:20:16,838
Jassi!

2432
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:19,735
Jasneet!

2433
02:20:19,842 --> 02:20:24,939
lf you want to play
hide and seek, we will.

2434
02:20:30,586 --> 02:20:31,917
l said leave me.

2435
02:20:36,692 --> 02:20:38,284
l said leave me.

2436
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:41,822
Nihaal!

2437
02:20:42,698 --> 02:20:46,896
Come here.. you..

2438
02:20:50,072 --> 02:20:53,337
l did not think, you
will be like that.

2439
02:21:05,254 --> 02:21:07,916
You have ruined all my plans.

2440
02:21:09,325 --> 02:21:11,793
l had you attacked so many times.

2441
02:21:12,562 --> 02:21:14,655
And you escaped all the time.

2442
02:21:16,098 --> 02:21:17,531
Do you know why?

2443
02:21:18,568 --> 02:21:21,002
Because l did not want to kill you.

2444
02:21:21,304 --> 02:21:23,101
l just wanted to scare you.

2445
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:29,177
So that the whole world
suspects your family. Not on me.

2446
02:21:29,478 --> 02:21:32,413
Then when you turned into a
21 years old millionaire..

2447
02:21:32,548 --> 02:21:35,210
..and the whole property would
be transferred in your name..

2448
02:21:36,319 --> 02:21:38,685
..then l would marry you.

2449
02:21:39,822 --> 02:21:42,518
And then l would slowly kill you.

2450
02:21:46,195 --> 02:21:49,824
After that automatically the
whole property would become mine.

2451
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:54,959
But you fell in love with
Nihaal and ruined all my plans.

2452
02:21:55,071 --> 02:21:56,299
But now..

2453
02:21:57,373 --> 02:22:00,865
Now you are in my hands,
who will save you?

2454
02:22:01,978 --> 02:22:06,108
That Singh? Nihaal Singh.
He got scared.

2455
02:22:08,684 --> 02:22:11,551
Singh singha. Singh singha.

2456
02:22:11,787 --> 02:22:14,585
Mr. Singha, Mr. Singha.

2457
02:22:14,724 --> 02:22:17,693
Singh singha. Singh singha.

2458
02:22:17,793 --> 02:22:20,591
Mr. Singha, Mr. Singha.

2459
02:22:20,696 --> 02:22:23,824
Singh singha. Singh singha.

2460
02:22:23,966 --> 02:22:26,730
Mr. Singha, Mr. Singha.

2461
02:22:26,836 --> 02:22:29,737
Singh singha. Singh singha.

2462
02:22:29,839 --> 02:22:32,865
Mr. Singha, Mr. Singha.

2463
02:22:46,889 --> 02:22:49,756
When a lover loves,
he will beat you up.

2464
02:22:52,495 --> 02:22:55,396
When the fear is lost,
then face a Jatt.

2465
02:22:59,769 --> 02:23:02,067
Touch her. Touch her.

2466
02:23:27,697 --> 02:23:36,071
Beloved..

2467
02:23:36,706 --> 02:23:42,975
Beloved..

2468
02:24:02,998 --> 02:24:09,733
Beloved..

2469
02:24:12,007 --> 02:24:17,741
Beloved..

2470
02:25:14,804 --> 02:25:15,930
Nihaal!

2471
02:26:22,171 --> 02:26:23,399
Nihaal!

2472
02:26:46,795 --> 02:26:49,195
Your Roop's job is done.

2473
02:26:49,398 --> 02:26:50,660
Now tell me what is the plan?

2474
02:26:50,799 --> 02:26:52,289
What should l say?

2475
02:26:52,568 --> 02:26:54,297
Make me your mother's daughter-in-law.

2476
02:26:55,204 --> 02:26:56,694
Tell me, you agree?

2477
02:26:56,805 --> 02:26:59,069
lf l would not agree, would l
be unnecessarily following you?

2478
02:26:59,208 --> 02:27:02,644
Listen, go back home. You
will have to wash clothes here.

2479
02:27:02,778 --> 02:27:04,837
You will wash the clothes.
- Why?

2480
02:27:04,980 --> 02:27:06,811
You have more experience.

2481
02:27:06,949 --> 02:27:09,144
Flatbread?
- You will make the flatbread..

2482
02:27:09,285 --> 02:27:10,980
..do you want to get
from the Gurudwara?
