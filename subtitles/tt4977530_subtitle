1
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:07,918
Oi! Jeet! What took you so long?

2
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,710
<i>This is what I imagine
England looks like.</i>

3
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:28,918
<i>England is all slums
and bombsites.</i>

4
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,626
- You know why they're letting this go?
- No.

5
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,918
The war has exhausted them.
They can't afford to keep us.

6
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,793
Careful, she'll hear you.

7
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:43,501
Queen Victoria, Empress of India.
She never even set a foot here.

8
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:44,918
Now Mountbatten sahib

9
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:48,210
can finally take his great-grandmother
back home.

10
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,543
This is the new recruit, Jeet Kumar.
He's Punjabi, like me.

11
00:03:57,626 --> 00:04:00,585
From my village near Lahore.
I have known him since he was a boy.

12
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:02,543
Very good, sir, very capable.

13
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:05,626
It is a great honour
to be in Viceroy's House.

14
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,251
I spoke with your last employer
on the telephone this morning.

15
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:13,085
The Governor of Punjab expressed
his regret at losing you.

16
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:16,960
You'll be working with Mr Gupta
in the inner circle.

17
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:20,168
We are responsible for the personal
care of the Viceroy.

18
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:23,335
It is a position of great trust,
you understand?

19
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:24,626
Yes, sir.

20
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,960
A privilege.

21
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:29,626
Mountbatten sahib is a heroic man.
He freed Burma.

22
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,835
Indeed.

23
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,543
Now he has come to free India.

24
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:38,418
You think you Indians are ready
to run your own civil service?

25
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,418
Courts of law?

26
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:42,751
Your own armed forces?

27
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:45,501
We've learnt from the best, sir.

28
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:50,043
I have chosen you, not because of
your vast experience,

29
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:53,710
but because The Honourable
Pamela Mountbatten is 18

30
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,918
and might appreciate your youth.

31
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:00,126
But what about my duties here?

32
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,043
This is an honour I am giving you.

33
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:07,085
Yes, ma'am.

34
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:12,626
The men translate for statesmen while
we translate chitchat for English child.

35
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,835
I hear she's friends with
Princess Elizabeth.

36
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:16,793
Protocol - stand to attention
when they pass.

37
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:19,460
Then she'll be looking down
her long Mountbatten nose at...

38
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:21,251
Oi, sala, move.

39
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:23,376
Stop staring at them.

40
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,251
Aalia?

41
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:27,376
Sorry, miss. My friend is new.

42
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,126
He doesn't know the protocol yet.

43
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,876
Aalia, we're late.

44
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:44,585
Wait, sala. Who is she?

45
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,168
A Hindu boy like you
and a Muslim girl?

46
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:51,835
I knew her father when he was in jail
in Lahore.

47
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:54,960
You started out as a policeman?

48
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:58,793
Yes, sir. I have been under-valet
for two years.

49
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:02,210
Why did you leave your job?

50
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:04,543
I was working in a jail, sir.

51
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:07,210
Many of our leaders
were in prison there.

52
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:11,710
I found myself unable to turn keys, sir.

53
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:13,460
And yet...

54
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,710
you'd work for the British Viceroy?

55
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,251
He will not be Viceroy for long, sir.

56
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:20,876
Freedom is coming.

57
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,751
Better to be close to power and watch

58
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:29,126
than to agitate against it.

59
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,626
How else will we step in
when our time comes?

60
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:38,710
What's that? Look, Mizzy.

61
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:41,418
What can you see?
What can you see?

62
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:45,585
That's more like it.

63
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,501
Stop hogging the mirror, Daddy.

64
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,918
You know, the Aussies called him
a beaut.

65
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:54,918
And who can deny it?

66
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:59,460
Churchill called this
the worst job in the world.

67
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:02,751
Well, he's wrong.
Burma was the worst job in the world.

68
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:06,043
You're giving a nation back to its people.
How bad can it be?

69
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,793
Churchill was wrong about Gandhi too.

70
00:07:08,876 --> 00:07:12,376
- What did he call him?
- A half-naked fakir.

71
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,960
That's really rather rude.

72
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:20,168
Yes, British Empire brought to
its knees by a man in a loin cloth.

73
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,710
Poor Winston.

74
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:24,626
He's walking around like a chap
who's swallowed a wasp.

75
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,751
Well, he is part of the past, darling.

76
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:28,376
You're bringing the future.

77
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,876
<i>We</i> are.

78
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:33,085
Well...

79
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,835
Then let's not make a mess of it.

80
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,126
Attention!

81
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,376
Your Excellency.

82
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,210
Not for much longer.

83
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:19,460
Welcome. You know Lord Ismay,
Chief of Staff.

84
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:22,043
- Pug, good to see you.
- Glad to be on the team.

85
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,543
Welcome to the infernal heat, my dear.

86
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:26,835
- Lady Wavell.
- Dickie.

87
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,251
I must say, I think it's a little shabby,
the way Whitehall's ousted you.

88
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:32,751
- Sir? One photo, sir?
- I was always Churchill's man

89
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:36,085
and now Atlee's Labour government
has swept the board.

90
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:38,793
Lord Louis, what do you hope
to achieve?

91
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,543
I have been given a very specific task.

92
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,835
I am to be the last Viceroy of India

93
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:45,793
and I shall carry out the role
with great pride.

94
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:53,251
Ah.

95
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:55,626
Oh, this is quite something.

96
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,876
Wonderful!

97
00:08:58,335 --> 00:09:00,251
This is the indoor staff.

98
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:02,126
Good heavens!

99
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,418
500 and something, I believe.

100
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:07,126
On behalf of you all...

101
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,918
I'd like to welcome the incoming
Viceroy and his family.

102
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:20,126
I am sure that you will give them
the same good service

103
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,668
that you have always given us.

104
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:31,876
So?

105
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,501
Who is he?

106
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:38,210
My father was jailed for marching
with Gandhiji.

107
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:41,376
My mother and I were not allowed
to visit him,

108
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,710
but there was this young
Hindu policeman who helped us.

109
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:50,918
He took letters, food, medicine
for my father.

110
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:53,710
But your face when you saw him.

111
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,251
I was... I was only surprised
to see him.

112
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:59,543
- Stop making mischief.
- This solves a mystery, Aalia.

113
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:02,293
Sunita, there's nothing between us.

114
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:04,918
Nothing for you, maybe.

115
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,793
I don't envy you, Dickie.

116
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:10,501
I tried to solve it, but it's operation
madhouse, if you ask me.

117
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:12,293
Thousands dead already.

118
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:15,835
300 million Hindus and Sikhs
want a united India

119
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:19,793
but many of the 100 million
Muslims do not.

120
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:23,043
The Muslim minority don't want to be
part of India.

121
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:26,085
They want their own country, Pakistan.

122
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:29,376
There's such rancour between
the leaders now,

123
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,751
it's nigh on impossible to get them
in the same room.

124
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:35,918
Well, whatever their differences are,
all Indians have one thing in common.

125
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,918
- What's that?
- They can't wait to get rid of us.

126
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:41,543
- Mr Nehru, sir.
- Hm.

127
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,793
Mr Nehru and some of the other
leaders were kind enough

128
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,210
to come and meet my plane.
I asked them all to eat with us.

129
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:49,043
It seemed the least I could do.
I hope it's not inconvenient.

130
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,626
- Excellency.
- Good afternoon.

131
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,085
- Lord Ismay.
- Hello.

132
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:56,585
My dear, dear Dickie.

133
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:58,585
Panditji, thank you for joining us.

134
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:02,835
It is always a pleasure to be in
the Viceroy's house and not in his jails.

135
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:05,043
You would not have needed
to be jailed

136
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:08,210
had you not been trying to undermine
us as we fought the Nazis.

137
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,418
We promised you help in return
for independence.

138
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,376
How could we fight Hitler

139
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,710
when our own country was already
under foreign occupation?

140
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:20,585
2.5 million of your fellow countrymen
found a way.

141
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:23,668
- Those Indians volunteered.
- Indeed.

142
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:26,585
You would not have won
without their sacrifice.

143
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:28,876
You owe India a great debt.

144
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,710
And Panditji owes Cambridge
a great debt

145
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:34,043
for honing his debating skills.

146
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:39,293
There are 34
reception rooms, 34 state rooms,

147
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:42,543
ten private dining rooms, a cinema.

148
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:45,418
Makes Buckingham Palace
look like a bungalow.

149
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,376
I'm so hot, I think I might actually die.

150
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,085
Ma'am, here's the food for the dog.

151
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:58,751
Would you take them onto the terrace?
It was such a long journey.

152
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:01,168
It's just terribly, terribly hot.

153
00:12:01,251 --> 00:12:03,001
Ah, just there, please.

154
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:06,335
What do we have here?

155
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:11,168
I haven't seen chicken like this
since before rationing.

156
00:12:12,585 --> 00:12:16,543
Lady Sahib, if the food is incorrect,
we are very sorry. We will take it away.

157
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:18,376
No, please, leave it.

158
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,793
You don't think...

159
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,126
Why not?

160
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,501
Mm.

161
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:36,085
The Order of the Garter,
worn singularly

162
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:39,918
or together with the Order of the Star
of India, depending on the occasion.

163
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,710
If I want to push the boat out,
then I will wear all four.

164
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:44,335
Now to dressing.

165
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:46,376
We're going to get this down to
a fine art.

166
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,835
I never want to spend more than
two minutes dressing.

167
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,168
Yes, Excellency.

168
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:53,085
Not "Excellency" till after
the ceremony. "Sir" will do.

169
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:55,835
Right. Socks, no suspenders.

170
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:58,126
Braces, leave on the trousers.

171
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,335
Have you seen that before?

172
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:02,210
- Hm?
- No, sir.

173
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:05,835
How much time do we waste
buttoning trousers?

174
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,710
One just steps into these and...
The whole of the Navy uses them now.

175
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:13,501
This morning I'd say we're pulling out
all the stops.

176
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:14,835
And...

177
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:17,460
Duleep Singh, isn't it?

178
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:18,835
Yes, sir.

179
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:20,626
Lord Wavell speaks very highly of you.

180
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,876
- Thank you, sir. Honour to serve.
- And...?

181
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,126
Jeet Kumar, sir. From Punjab.

182
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,376
He's the new boy.

183
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,626
Well, Kumar, we have something
in common there.

184
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,876
Now...

185
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,043
Are we ready?

186
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:09,960
13 minutes.

187
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:11,335
Hm.

188
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,251
We'll do better next time.

189
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:23,418
<i>I, Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas,
Viscount Mountbatten of Burma,</i>

190
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:29,543
<i>do swear true allegiance to our
Sovereign Lord, King George VI,</i>

191
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:33,501
<i>Defender of the Faith,
Emperor of India,</i>

192
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:38,876
<i>and I will faithfully fill the office
of Viceroy of India</i>

193
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,085
<i>according to law.</i>

194
00:14:40,168 --> 00:14:42,085
<i>May God be my guide.</i>

195
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,876
Oi! Have you never seen gories
in fine dresses before?

196
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,376
You may be new but you must know
your place.

197
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,751
Oi, Mohsin bhai. Leave him be.
He's my friend.

198
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:03,793
You Punjabis always look after
your own.

199
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:06,626
- You Bengalis...
- Hey! Don't talk like that.

200
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,751
Get back to your places.

201
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:15,043
<i>This is not a normal
Viceroyalty on which I am embarking.</i>

202
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:19,543
<i>I am under no illusion about
the difficulty of my task.</i>

203
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:24,376
<i>I shall need the greatest goodwill
of the greatest possible number</i>

204
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,501
<i>and I am asking India today
for that goodwill.</i>

205
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:33,001
Why don't you listen
to what he has to say?

206
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:35,585
Because I've heard it all before.

207
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,960
Ubba, maybe the Mountbattens
will be different.

208
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:46,168
He is the King's cousin.

209
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:48,751
He has empire in his blood.

210
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:58,460
My husband's study
is the first priority.

211
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:02,335
It has to be refurbished.
It needs light and brightness.

212
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:06,335
He says it reeks of failed negotiations.

213
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:08,918
Consider it done, ma'am.

214
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:13,376
I'll continue my tour after breakfast,
Miss Reading,

215
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,585
but in the meantime,

216
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:19,168
would you put your heads together
with the ADCs

217
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:21,793
and rethink the guest lists?

218
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:28,543
From now on almost half of all guests
at all occasions must be Indian.

219
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:31,918
- Yes, ma'am.
- Also, I want to meet Indian women.

220
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,293
Thank you.

221
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,543
Sarojini Naidu, Pandit Nehru's sister,

222
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:43,293
Mrs Aruna Ali Asif,
Rajkumari Amrit Kaur.

223
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:46,251
- Have you got that, Miss Noor?
- Yes, ma'am.

224
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,626
Here are the riders.

225
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,251
I have a feeling, Pammy,

226
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:52,727
that might be the only hour of the day
I get to spend with you.

227
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:54,293
Each day is so crammed.

228
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:57,376
Two poached eggs, tomatoes,
sausages, tea.

229
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,543
Lots to do.

230
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:02,210
Darling, did you know that 92%
of the population is illiterate?

231
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:03,460
Good morning.

232
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:07,168
And that one in five babies dies
before they're four months old?

233
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:10,043
Edwina, I could not be blessed
with a more active, able wife,

234
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:12,293
- but sometimes we have to accept...
- I know.

235
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:13,918
...what we cannot change.

236
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,043
But we can change a lot, Dickie.

237
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:18,793
We really can,
and we absolutely have to.

238
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:23,710
India's problems are not just political.
They are social and economic.

239
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,085
Almost half the babies born here
die before they're five.

240
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:31,668
That cannot be the legacy the British
leave India after three centuries.

241
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:35,210
We have enough time
to improve the infrastructure

242
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:37,493
- so that when we leave...
- That is not why we're here.

243
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:39,585
- Yes.
- You'll wear yourself out.

244
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:41,876
You mean I'll wear you out.

245
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,376
No...

246
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,793
Edwina, I have the governors
arriving from the provinces.

247
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:50,043
I know. I'm entertaining their wives.

248
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,585
And I'm very grateful
for everything you do.

249
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,668
Miss Hudson, is there something
the matter?

250
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:09,626
Nothing at all, ma'am, only I do wish
they wouldn't come so close.

251
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:15,876
Perhaps your very able gifts
would be better used in Surrey.

252
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,085
I beg your pardon, ma'am?

253
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:20,835
Would you please pack your bags
and go home?

254
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:38,585
Have you got the papers? I'll need
them for the meeting after this one.

255
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:40,876
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:18:45,293 --> 00:18:47,460
Miss Noor?

257
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,335
I have a message for you, from home.

258
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:53,793
Go on.

259
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,168
I had to see you.

260
00:18:59,626 --> 00:19:02,001
How is your father?

261
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:05,585
Jeet, what are you doing?
Nothing has changed.

262
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:08,376
I see you are still unmarried.

263
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,626
I am still promised to another.

264
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:19,960
I have tried every day for the past
two years to forget you.

265
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:22,085
Then try harder.

266
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,918
The violence is escalating
day by day.

267
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:03,085
This hatred between Hindu, Sikh
and Muslim

268
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,501
is poisoning everything we've built.

269
00:20:05,585 --> 00:20:10,085
In Bengal the violence is
compounded by a famine

270
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:13,876
which the people think we are doing
precious little to relieve.

271
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,710
The sooner we can hand over
to an Indian government...

272
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,293
the better.

273
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:20,626
But what government?

274
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,460
These wretched Indian leaders
won't agree.

275
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:27,418
If the Muslims are denied their Pakistan

276
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,210
my province will have all-out civil war.

277
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:31,751
The same in the Punjab.

278
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:35,210
The Hindus won't tolerate a Pakistan
they haven't voted for.

279
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:37,751
Oh, God! Gentlemen...

280
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:39,918
Our saviour is here.

281
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:41,251
He walks among us.

282
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:42,376
Off the record, Pug,

283
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,960
we're not sure Dickie Mountbatten's
the man for this job.

284
00:20:46,043 --> 00:20:50,543
Look, he has amazing ability
to get along with people.

285
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:55,335
But these Indians are as slippery
as eels.

286
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:58,418
The Indians have to believe

287
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:01,585
that whatever the future of India is,

288
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:03,543
it is their idea.

289
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:05,543
And trust me,

290
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:08,168
if anyone can get them to agree,

291
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:10,085
it's Dickie.

292
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:14,293
He could charm a vulture off a corpse.

293
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:17,543
Nothing will stop the violence now, Pug.

294
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,710
It's already far too late.

295
00:21:19,793 --> 00:21:23,668
And if Mountbatten thinks charm
alone can do it, then he's a fool.

296
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,668
Thank you for your candour.

297
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:29,126
- Your Excellency...
- I know how grave the situation is.

298
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,293
I'm meeting the leaders
and all the maharajas,

299
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:33,043
who of course have their own fears

300
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,835
about what a transfer of power
will bring.

301
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,043
There is a great deal to do.

302
00:21:37,126 --> 00:21:38,668
I want to hear from all of you.

303
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,501
<i>The growing conflict between Muslim
and Hindu</i>

304
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,793
<i>has left 40,000 dead.</i>

305
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:57,668
<i>The new Viceroy arrives in India</i>

306
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:00,876
<i>amid scenes of terrible death
and destruction.</i>

307
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,126
<i>It would be a disgrace</i>

308
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,626
<i>and an everlasting slur on Britain's
standing in the world</i>

309
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:14,126
<i>if we were to abandon 400 million
primitive Indians to their fate.</i>

310
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:19,960
Do it nicely.

311
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,793
You have to cut neatly.
It has to be neat.

312
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:27,751
They all have to be the same size.

313
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:31,376
This is most irregular.
The staff will not understand.

314
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,585
I want them to know who we are.

315
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:42,876
Lady Mountbatten.

316
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,085
Your Excellency.

317
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,918
Aap door!

318
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,501
<i>Get the chickens from the oven now!</i>

319
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:54,960
Our head English chef left us rather
unexpectedly with Lord Wavell.

320
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:58,376
We are awaiting his replacement
from England.

321
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,043
Meanwhile, may I present
our acting head chef,

322
00:23:02,126 --> 00:23:04,585
Ram Lal Chandra,

323
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:10,626
He has been fully trained
in the finest European cuisine

324
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,543
and should meet your requirements
sufficiently.

325
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:18,626
I do believe we can save the new
English chef the journey.

326
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,210
Mr Chandra will do
a perfectly good job.

327
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:28,001
That wonderful dinner you served last
night put Claridges to shame.

328
00:23:28,085 --> 00:23:32,710
Lady Sahib, the credit must also
go to my staff

329
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:36,376
and my sous-chef, Jinnah Abdul Malik.

330
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,001
He prepares a most excellent
Lamb Wellington

331
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,085
and bread and butter pudding
with the finest marmalade.

332
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:47,585
That's all well and good, but with
your agreement, Chef Chandra,

333
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:50,501
I'd like to make a few changes.

334
00:23:50,585 --> 00:23:56,210
From now on there'll be more Indians
of all faiths round our table.

335
00:23:56,293 --> 00:23:59,043
Their culinary needs must be waited for.

336
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:04,043
Many of them eat with their fingers,
Your Excellency.

337
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,960
If that is custom, then it's perfectly
acceptable.

338
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:11,335
Lady Sahib, many Indians are
vegetarians.

339
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:14,293
No mutton, no chicken, no game.

340
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:20,710
Is there something wrong?

341
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,668
What he was saying...

342
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:24,668
Your Excellency.

343
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,251
It is so fine that you want
to be more inclusive.

344
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:34,293
We have waited a long time for this day.

345
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:38,293
I appreciate your understanding.

346
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,960
And your skill.

347
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:44,710
I need to meet with the governors' wives.

348
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:47,876
What kind of an example
are you setting, Abdul bir?

349
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,293
Yard.

350
00:24:49,376 --> 00:24:51,501
- Z for...?
- Zebra!

351
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:53,710
I wish I could communicate with them.

352
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,835
Why don't you try this?

353
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:58,085
Mera naam Pamela hai.

354
00:24:58,168 --> 00:25:00,793
Er... Mera naam Pamela hai.

355
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,293
No Viceroy or members of his family

356
00:25:05,376 --> 00:25:08,751
have ever visited the staff
compound before.

357
00:25:08,835 --> 00:25:12,543
The houses look small
for an entire family.

358
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,001
Where do you live here, Aalia?

359
00:25:14,085 --> 00:25:16,043
I live right there with my father.

360
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:18,085
Did you go to the school?

361
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:19,460
No, I grew up in Amritsar.

362
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:21,876
I went to a ladies' college.

363
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,293
And then events turned unfortunate.

364
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:28,043
My father lost his eyesight and...

365
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,626
and now I work.

366
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,418
That must be very hard.

367
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:34,710
Not at all. My work gives me
independence.

368
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:36,376
That's what my mother says.

369
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,751
She says she didn't know who she was
until she started working

370
00:25:39,835 --> 00:25:41,751
and really she's tireless.

371
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:44,585
I hardly saw her during the war.
She was so busy.

372
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:24,710
Welcome, Jeet, to my son's
engagement party.

373
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,043
You know of course my son, Sanjit.

374
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:28,585
Of course. Welcome here.

375
00:26:28,668 --> 00:26:32,126
Have you met this wonderful girl
who is going to be his wife, Sunita?

376
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,460
No, we have not formally met yet,
but I am delighted.

377
00:26:35,543 --> 00:26:37,793
- Congratulations to you both.
- Thank you.

378
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:41,585
Hello, sir.

379
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:45,668
I hope you will remember me.
I am Jeet Kumar.

380
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:48,710
Ah, Jeet Kumar.

381
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:50,501
The little policeman.

382
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,543
Barely old enough to tie his shoes.

383
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:57,418
- Ha, ha! Yes, sir.
- Sit, sit.

384
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:59,960
It's good to meet you again,
Jeet Kumar.

385
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:03,668
Remember, you used to read me
Dickens?

386
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:06,751
Yes, sir. <i>David Copperfield,</i>

387
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,543
<i>Bleak House.</i>

388
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,501
What brings you to Delhi?

389
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:13,126
I have great expectations.

390
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:18,210
I am working for Mountbatten sahib.

391
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:24,626
Aalia, I thought you'd never get here.

392
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,043
I was with Lady Pamela.

393
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:28,460
- What's she like?
- Full of questions.

394
00:27:28,543 --> 00:27:30,501
She's actually interested in us.

395
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:33,210
She wants to be involved
and improve the school.

396
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:35,918
Aren't you married yet?

397
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:39,668
That girl you used to talk to me about,
did she change her mind?

398
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:42,918
No, sir...

399
00:27:43,001 --> 00:27:44,710
but I live in hope.

400
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,335
Ah.

401
00:27:46,418 --> 00:27:49,043
- Ubba.
- Ah, Aalia.

402
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,168
Do you remember Jeet Kumar?

403
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:52,918
Yes, Ubba.

404
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:55,168
My daughter too is still unmarried

405
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:58,418
but her young man, Asif,
will soon be back.

406
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:03,376
He has been in Europe all this time,
fighting in the British army.

407
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,918
As soon as he returns
we will have the wedding.

408
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:09,960
This is Aalia's poor mother's
dying wish.

409
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,543
She chose you a good man.

410
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:14,126
- Don't you think, Aalia?
- Yes, Ubba.

411
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,126
We must go now. It's late. Come.

412
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,960
Come, my friend. I'll walk you home.

413
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:24,210
You stay, celebrate with your friend.

414
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:27,418
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Jeet Kumar.

415
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:30,876
Jeet?

416
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,501
That prison took away my sight.

417
00:28:35,585 --> 00:28:38,668
It could have taken away my dignity too.

418
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:41,210
You made sure it did not.

419
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:44,043
I'm grateful.

420
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:53,668
I'll always be grateful
for your care for my father.

421
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:56,418
There you are! Come on.

422
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,793
Let's show them how we do things
in Punjab.

423
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,835
What harm is in a dance?

424
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:33,960
Oi, sala. She doesn't want to dance.

425
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:35,918
Watch what you're doing.

426
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:40,876
He wasn't doing anything. It's fine.

427
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,376
You dance with your own kind.

428
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,710
- My own kind?
- Calm down.

429
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:48,501
Have some respect.

430
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:51,543
Since when does a Mussalman
tell us what to do?

431
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:58,001
Come, come, come.

432
00:29:58,085 --> 00:29:59,543
Shake now.

433
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:01,876
Musicians, please...

434
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,918
It's three o'clock in the morning.

435
00:30:39,626 --> 00:30:41,335
Come to bed.

436
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,293
Your family tree can wait.

437
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:46,126
Edwina, I wasn't...

438
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,668
I'm reading the governors' reports.

439
00:30:49,793 --> 00:30:51,460
Very unpleasant.

440
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:54,168
I fear a migraine looms.

441
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:57,793
- Did you take one of your pills?
- They are not working.

442
00:30:57,876 --> 00:31:00,210
Nothing works. It's just...

443
00:31:03,418 --> 00:31:06,376
Jenkins' report on Punjab is the worst.

444
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:12,043
The more I discover here, the more...

445
00:31:12,126 --> 00:31:13,626
depressing it is.

446
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,251
The real lesson of the day is that
our time frame for exiting won't work.

447
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,168
We have to act more quickly
than I thought.

448
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:21,585
Dickie...

449
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:23,168
this needs time.

450
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:25,876
The longer we stay, the more we risk
further violence.

451
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,335
We haven't the means or the manpower
to keep the peace.

452
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:31,251
Don't rush.

453
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:33,293
Seriously.

454
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,501
This is why you're terrible at chess.

455
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:42,001
Pug believes that Pakistan is inevitable.

456
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:45,668
He thinks I should meet Jinnah first
to understand why.

457
00:31:46,876 --> 00:31:52,168
Nehru has offered you
a very precious thing.

458
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:54,293
Friendship.

459
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:56,460
Why don't you talk with him first?

460
00:31:56,543 --> 00:32:00,585
Now, we want to find
the best possible solution.

461
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,710
Congress will not contemplate
dividing our Mother India.

462
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:08,460
It would make a mockery of everything
that we have striven for

463
00:32:08,543 --> 00:32:11,335
and it would break Gandhiji's heart.

464
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:13,460
Then how are we to keep the peace?

465
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:16,626
You want us to quit India,
but how can we leave

466
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,085
when you can't agree on what
your future should be?

467
00:32:19,168 --> 00:32:22,210
Are you blaming us
for the situation here?

468
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:26,585
I'm not blaming anyone, but at all costs
we must avoid a civil war.

469
00:32:26,668 --> 00:32:30,793
Forgive me, but this is the result of
British policy.

470
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:33,210
You have done everything

471
00:32:33,293 --> 00:32:36,210
to foster hatred between
our different communities.

472
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:40,960
Separate schools, textbooks, elections.

473
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,376
That was always your policy,

474
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,001
divide and rule.

475
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:51,210
So now you have divided us,
you ask me for a solution.

476
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:53,918
"Without peace,

477
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:56,501
"all other dreams vanish

478
00:32:56,585 --> 00:32:58,335
"and are reduced to ashes."

479
00:33:01,585 --> 00:33:03,251
You went on to say

480
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:09,501
that the only alternative to co-existence
is co-destruction.

481
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:14,793
But I'm really only here to ask you
to pass on a message.

482
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:18,835
Your sister very kindly offered
to show me round Congress.

483
00:33:18,918 --> 00:33:22,585
Please, would you tell her
I'd be honoured to accept?

484
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,043
Gladly.

485
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:35,085
Your wife is very well read.

486
00:33:35,168 --> 00:33:36,585
Yes.

487
00:33:36,668 --> 00:33:40,793
The irony is, of course, that she's far
more of a political animal than I am.

488
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:43,751
She's an idealist,
tends to the left. I'm...

489
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:46,335
more of a military man.

490
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:48,501
What are your orders here?

491
00:33:48,585 --> 00:33:54,626
To bring independence to India
as smoothly as is possible.

492
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,001
But what is that India?
What will it be?

493
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:01,043
India is her people,

494
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:03,751
individual men and women

495
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:06,876
held together by indivisible threads.

496
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,918
Our spirit can never be beaten.

497
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:14,501
Through all the years of your empire,
it has only grown stronger.

498
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:18,043
We belong together, in a secular...

499
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:21,085
This is what our fathers fought for.

500
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:24,668
I'm so happy that we're here
to witness it.

501
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:29,710
What is the first thing
you'll do when India becomes free?

502
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:33,918
I'm going to climb to the top of
the dome of Viceroy's House

503
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:35,543
and scream for joy.

504
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:37,418
And you?

505
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:41,960
I'm going to marry you.

506
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:47,043
How can that ever happen?

507
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,335
You are so courageous.

508
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:53,001
You are the bravest woman I know.

509
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,751
Don't run from what is true.

510
00:34:59,918 --> 00:35:03,543
What do you personally think?

511
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:10,251
To divide India would be a tragedy.

512
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:14,751
Then please, talk to Jinnah.

513
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:18,960
This is quite a new sensation.

514
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:20,543
What is?

515
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:22,835
Trusting the Viceroy.

516
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,085
I've spent nine years of my life
in British jails,

517
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:32,335
but I believe in your sincerity, Dickie,

518
00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:35,793
and I believe that you love my country.

519
00:35:36,876 --> 00:35:39,876
Don't let Jinnah persuade you
to tear it in two.

520
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,918
Ubba?

521
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:18,460
I have brought someone to see you.

522
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,460
Aalia, where have you been?

523
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:24,085
Ubba, here is Jeet Kumar.

524
00:36:24,168 --> 00:36:26,126
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

525
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,126
We have something important
to speak...

526
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,460
Later, later.

527
00:36:29,543 --> 00:36:32,335
You will never guess who is here.

528
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:36,751
Aalia.

529
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:38,876
- Asif?
- As-Salaam-Alaikum.

530
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,710
Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.

531
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:46,960
I was so worried that you wouldn't
recognise me.

532
00:36:47,043 --> 00:36:49,168
It's been too long.

533
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:52,918
I thought the British Army
would never let us leave.

534
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:55,376
We were the last regiment
to be demobbed.

535
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,876
Finally I feel the war is over.

536
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,876
Asif, this is Jeet Kumar,
my old friend from Lahore.

537
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,501
Aalia, can you believe, Asif's working
with Jinnah sahib?

538
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:08,126
Mohammad Ali Jinnah?

539
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,501
Only as his driver and aide.

540
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:13,126
I'm aiming to serve him however I can.

541
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,960
Asif, tell Mr Jinnah,

542
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:18,960
many Muslims also fought for India.

543
00:37:19,043 --> 00:37:21,418
We don't want a separate country.

544
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:26,043
- Jinnah sahib is a visionary, sir.
- He is a troublemaker.

545
00:37:26,126 --> 00:37:29,668
He's the only one
speaking for us.

546
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,210
- Mr Jinnah...
- Mr Jinnah...

547
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:45,251
<i>Spokesman for a large group of
India's Mohammedans</i>

548
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:48,960
<i>is the leader of the All-India Muslim
League, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.</i>

549
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:51,668
<i>In direct conflict with the Congress
party's request</i>

550
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:53,126
<i>for national independence...</i>

551
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,668
Pakistan Zindabad!

552
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:59,210
<i>...he has demanded that Britain create
a separate and independent state</i>

553
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:02,293
<i>out of those provinces in which
Muslims predominate.</i>

554
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,418
We are also looking
to the future.

555
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:09,751
I learned this when I visited
the ancient spires of Cambridge.

556
00:38:09,835 --> 00:38:13,918
Oh, yes, a haven
for historians.

557
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:16,251
Cambridge also creates visionaries.

558
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,626
Such as your old friend Mr Nehru.

559
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,876
A little after Mr Nehru's time, in 1933,
a group of Cambridge students

560
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,168
came up with a truly magnificent
original idea.

561
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:28,501
And what was that?

562
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:30,710
Pakistan.

563
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:32,460
The land of the pure.

564
00:38:33,626 --> 00:38:35,751
Muslims do not want to be reduced

565
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:38,543
to the unequal position of negroes
in America.

566
00:38:38,626 --> 00:38:42,043
I assure you Muslims would never be
treated as second-class citizens.

567
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:45,418
But we are a minority of one to four.
How can you guarantee that?

568
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:47,210
If you engage with the other leaders,

569
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:50,543
constitutional protection for
Muslim citizens can be secured.

570
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:54,251
It is the other leaders who refuse
to engage with me.

571
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:58,001
I already have the solution.

572
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:01,835
The creation of an Islamic country,
Pakistan.

573
00:39:08,668 --> 00:39:13,501
Could you really see India cut in half?

574
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:17,168
Sometimes surgery can save
the patient.

575
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:21,501
Where do you propose
to make the incision?

576
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:24,793
Pakistan will include all the states
that have a Muslim majority.

577
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:27,585
But what about those states
where the numbers are equal?

578
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:30,001
The Punjab, Bengal,
what do we do there?

579
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:32,418
Include them in Pakistan.

580
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:36,418
The ideals of Islam have taught us
democracy and justice.

581
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:39,668
Our Hindu and Sikh citizens will be
able to worship

582
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:41,668
and to vote as they please,

583
00:39:41,751 --> 00:39:45,085
but we Muslims will be protected.

584
00:39:45,168 --> 00:39:46,918
We will be in a majority.

585
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:51,001
Perhaps there was a time when
I believed

586
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:54,335
our interests could be secured
within a united India,

587
00:39:54,418 --> 00:39:56,543
but that was long ago.

588
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:01,918
Nehru and Gandhi have shown
no respect for me or my views,

589
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:04,751
so how can I trust them to respect
the views of my fellow Muslims?

590
00:40:07,835 --> 00:40:10,543
Look at this branch of my family tree.

591
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:14,251
See how it withers with
no new shoots.

592
00:40:14,335 --> 00:40:16,460
That's my Uncle Nicholas.

593
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:18,418
He was Tsar of Russia.

594
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:23,918
He and his entire family and staff
bayoneted, set on fire,

595
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:27,085
in order to create someone's utopia.

596
00:40:27,168 --> 00:40:29,418
New nations are rarely born in peace.

597
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:34,126
But to yoke Hindus and Muslims
together in one unequal state

598
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,876
is a recipe for the very bloodshed
you want to avoid.

599
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,418
United...

600
00:40:39,918 --> 00:40:43,043
...you are one fifth of
the world's population.

601
00:40:43,126 --> 00:40:46,585
India would be the greatest power
in all Asia.

602
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:49,043
India has never been a true nation.

603
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:52,501
It only looks that way on a map.

604
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:55,251
The British divided Ireland
to maintain peace.

605
00:40:56,835 --> 00:40:59,293
They are dividing Palestine.

606
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:02,126
They must do the same here.

607
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,126
I have heard with my own ears.

608
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,293
Jinnah sahib said he will cut India
in half.

609
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:10,251
- He will give us Pakistan.
- Yes.

610
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,418
No, no, no, no, no.
That cannot happen.

611
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:15,668
- Why can't it happen?
- Gandhiji said over his dead body.

612
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:17,501
He would not lie.

613
00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:19,918
Pakistan Zindabad.

614
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:23,043
- Pakistan Zindabad.
- Stop! Stop!

615
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:27,085
Stop, brothers!

616
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:29,626
Stop, brothers! Stop!

617
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,418
The British have controlled India
this past 300 years

618
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:35,335
by making sure we fight amongst
ourselves just like this.

619
00:41:35,418 --> 00:41:36,751
Guptaji...

620
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:39,668
No, Mohsin, do not allow this poison
to enter our thoughts.

621
00:41:39,751 --> 00:41:42,793
- Guptaji, Pakistan...
- Gentlemen!

622
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:46,126
Whatever is going on
in those rooms upstairs

623
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,335
is none of your business.

624
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:50,293
It's 5.45.

625
00:41:50,376 --> 00:41:52,376
Dinner is now running late.

626
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,335
All of you, jaldi, jaldi.

627
00:42:02,335 --> 00:42:05,460
Your family are from the Punjab,
aren't they?

628
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:07,501
Yes, sir, they are.

629
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:12,168
In my village, I have five sisters,
13 nieces and nine nephews.

630
00:42:12,251 --> 00:42:14,501
Duleep Singh, sir, his family
are our neighbours.

631
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:17,210
Do you have Muslim neighbours too?

632
00:42:17,293 --> 00:42:18,626
Of course, sir.

633
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,793
All the children play together.

634
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:24,835
They celebrate Diwali with us,
we celebrate Eid with them.

635
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:27,751
Sometimes there is even
marriage between us.

636
00:42:30,835 --> 00:42:32,251
Are you married?

637
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:34,418
No, sir.

638
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:37,376
I do not know if it is in my destiny.

639
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,001
My mother dreams of it.

640
00:42:39,085 --> 00:42:40,168
And your father?

641
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:47,543
He died, sir.

642
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:51,960
When I was a child.

643
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:56,751
Killed by the British at
the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.

644
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:19,085
Namaste, Bapuji,

645
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:25,418
It is a great honour to meet you, Bapu.

646
00:43:39,043 --> 00:43:41,460
- This way, sir.
- Over here, please, sir.

647
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,251
We Indians have
always marched, campaigned

648
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:58,751
and fasted together,
regardless of our creed or class.

649
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:04,168
For so long we have been united
in our opposition to one oppressor.

650
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:06,126
And now we are leaving.

651
00:44:07,918 --> 00:44:13,001
It seems freedom, although
longed for... is a fearful thing.

652
00:44:13,085 --> 00:44:16,710
And with fear comes violence.
It's contagious.

653
00:44:18,126 --> 00:44:20,585
But courage is even more contagious.

654
00:44:26,126 --> 00:44:28,960
Shall I tell you what the solution is?

655
00:44:33,668 --> 00:44:38,585
Jinnah should be asked
to form the first government.

656
00:44:38,668 --> 00:44:40,835
Of independent India?

657
00:44:45,585 --> 00:44:51,126
Congress must be prepared to accept
the leadership of the Muslim League

658
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,710
if, by so doing, they ensure
the unity of our country.

659
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:59,418
You would give the Muslims the baby
rather than carving it up?

660
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:01,293
But that's...

661
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,960
That's splendidly bold.

662
00:45:05,043 --> 00:45:08,251
Would Congress ever be induced
to accept it?

663
00:45:08,335 --> 00:45:09,501
Would Jinnah?

664
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,751
We must rekindle the lamp
of neighbourliness

665
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,543
between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs.

666
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:20,251
You give me hope that reason
will prevail.

667
00:45:20,335 --> 00:45:22,460
What we need is not reason.

668
00:45:23,626 --> 00:45:26,543
We need a far greater force.

669
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:31,960
A force that politicians
seldom care to mention.

670
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:33,751
Love?

671
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:35,626
Precisely.

672
00:45:36,793 --> 00:45:39,585
I hope you will honour me
with sharing my food.

673
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:41,293
This is goat's curd, my favourite.

674
00:45:41,376 --> 00:45:42,668
- Is it?
- You must try this.

675
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:44,043
- No...
- I insist.

676
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:45,293
May I have a spoon, please?

677
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:49,043
You must try this.
This is not cow's milk.

678
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:50,960
Wish me luck.

679
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,043
Delicious, isn't it?

680
00:45:57,126 --> 00:45:59,835
Would you like to try yourself?

681
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,168
I think it's what you'd call
an acquired taste...

682
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,835
Did you tell Asif it was too late for him?

683
00:46:12,918 --> 00:46:14,335
How could I?

684
00:46:17,793 --> 00:46:20,293
It's the truth.

685
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:23,335
My father has lost everything.

686
00:46:23,418 --> 00:46:25,751
His wife, his sight.

687
00:46:28,668 --> 00:46:30,626
He's a proud man,

688
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,001
unable to work, dependent on me.

689
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,460
Before Asif arrived, I'd forgotten what
it was like to see him really smile.

690
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:43,293
I have always made your father smile.

691
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:45,210
And you too.

692
00:46:45,293 --> 00:46:47,793
Aalia? Are you all right?

693
00:46:47,876 --> 00:46:49,668
Yes, ma'am.

694
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:05,085
The Viceroy certainly knows
how to throw a party.

695
00:47:05,168 --> 00:47:06,626
Your Excellency.

696
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,376
Mr Jinnah, welcome.

697
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,335
May I present Mr Henry F Grady,
the American ambassador.

698
00:47:11,418 --> 00:47:12,626
Your Excellencies.

699
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:14,460
Welcome, Mr Ambassador.

700
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:18,751
Ambassador to one country or to two?
The world can't wait to find out.

701
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,585
The answer may be in the hands
of Mr Jinnah.

702
00:47:21,668 --> 00:47:26,335
It must feel pretty galling for you
to be giving all of this back.

703
00:47:26,418 --> 00:47:28,043
Not at all.

704
00:47:28,126 --> 00:47:29,835
Well, it is high time.

705
00:47:29,918 --> 00:47:32,001
Aalia...

706
00:47:32,085 --> 00:47:34,293
imagine life in Pakistan.

707
00:47:34,376 --> 00:47:36,293
No prejudice, no tension.

708
00:47:36,376 --> 00:47:38,876
It's a nation our children
will be proud of.

709
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,085
We were born in India.

710
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:44,793
And our parents and all our ancestors
are buried here.

711
00:47:44,876 --> 00:47:47,460
- How can we leave?
- We'll visit.

712
00:47:47,543 --> 00:47:51,293
I'll drive my lovely wife
in Mr Jinnah's car.

713
00:47:51,376 --> 00:47:53,293
Why should we not be happy?

714
00:47:55,626 --> 00:48:00,293
We've both come through hard years
and I've kept you with me, always.

715
00:48:10,085 --> 00:48:11,626
I'm just a schoolgirl here.

716
00:48:12,751 --> 00:48:14,460
And I was just a boy.

717
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:18,376
But I knew.

718
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:22,251
Asif.

719
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,335
I am not that girl any more.

720
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,168
I understand this distance
you're keeping.

721
00:48:34,251 --> 00:48:36,876
You must have felt I abandoned you.

722
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,085
But I am here now.

723
00:48:42,168 --> 00:48:43,460
Please...

724
00:48:45,085 --> 00:48:46,376
Give me a chance.

725
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,376
I'll prove I can look after you.

726
00:48:54,085 --> 00:48:56,376
Miss Jinnah, I've been longing
to meet you.

727
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,460
And I you.

728
00:48:57,543 --> 00:49:00,626
Your Excellency... a word.

729
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,168
Please excuse me.

730
00:49:03,793 --> 00:49:05,251
Just one moment.

731
00:49:07,585 --> 00:49:09,501
That is not a conversation
I should leave.

732
00:49:09,585 --> 00:49:10,793
This better be good, Pug.

733
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:12,918
Anything but good.

734
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:14,918
There's been a massacre in Punjab.

735
00:49:15,001 --> 00:49:17,251
Half of Rawalpindi is on fire.

736
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:19,668
Muslims burned down
Sikh and Hindu houses.

737
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:23,251
Brutal reprisals have spread
through Muslim streets.

738
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:25,501
Order the Punjab police out in force.

739
00:49:25,585 --> 00:49:27,835
- We have.
- If this is replicated...

740
00:49:27,918 --> 00:49:31,376
With respect, there are
18,000 towns like this in Punjab.

741
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,960
We don't have the men.

742
00:49:33,043 --> 00:49:34,335
Then call in the Army.

743
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:37,668
There are barely any
English soldiers left.

744
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:39,835
The Indians have divided loyalties.

745
00:49:39,918 --> 00:49:44,210
How can we ask Sikhs to fire on
Sikhs, Muslims on Muslims?

746
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:47,460
I'm telling you, Dickie,
India is a ship on fire.

747
00:49:47,543 --> 00:49:48,793
Daddy, guess what?

748
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:51,001
- A telegram has come...
- Pamela, do not interrupt!

749
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:52,876
- From the King.
- Get them round the table.

750
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,043
All the leaders.

751
00:49:57,043 --> 00:49:58,543
Pammy!

752
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:01,501
I'm sorry.

753
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,251
Please tell me what it is.

754
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,460
Princess Lilibet is going to marry
Philip.

755
00:50:08,626 --> 00:50:10,126
But that's wonderful.

756
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,085
They want me for a bridesmaid.

757
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:14,043
That's splendid, Pammy.

758
00:50:15,668 --> 00:50:19,168
Come on, now. Let's not have this.
Can't let the side down, not in public.

759
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:29,876
<i>Following the bad news
of communal fighting in India,</i>

760
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,126
<i>with his wife and daughter, the
Viceroy has been paying a visit</i>

761
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:35,751
<i>to the north-west frontier and Punjab.</i>

762
00:50:35,835 --> 00:50:39,085
<i>He visited many of the places where
the worst clashes had occurred</i>

763
00:50:39,168 --> 00:50:42,710
<i>and saw for himself the serious extent
of the rioting</i>

764
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,710
<i>and the vast amount of damage done.</i>

765
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:28,876
Let Jinnah be Prime Minister
of independent India.

766
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,251
Bapuji, it won't work.

767
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:33,293
Why not?

768
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:37,710
With the best will in the world,
Jinnah will never agree.

769
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:40,126
He wouldn't even come to this table.

770
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:43,126
He said the time for talking is over.

771
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,626
I think it's a very daring idea.

772
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:48,876
Daring, yes, but feasible?

773
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,626
Jinnah's not a fool, Dickie.

774
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,501
He knows that you can't place
300 million Hindus

775
00:51:54,585 --> 00:51:57,668
under the rule of the Muslim League.
They won't have it.

776
00:51:57,751 --> 00:52:00,085
But if you leaders give him
your support?

777
00:52:00,168 --> 00:52:02,376
This is a democracy.

778
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,210
At the first opportunity,
the people will vote him out.

779
00:52:05,293 --> 00:52:08,460
Which brings us back to square one:

780
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:12,168
- The Muslim minority and Pakistan.
- I agree.

781
00:52:12,251 --> 00:52:16,543
Why do you all not see,
if we oppose partition,

782
00:52:16,626 --> 00:52:18,835
India remains united.

783
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:22,293
How many towns
descending into slaughter?

784
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:25,668
We've tried too long to break
this deadlock.

785
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:27,960
Singh, Kumar.

786
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:38,793
The world moves on.

787
00:52:38,876 --> 00:52:41,793
Not as we like it, but it moves.

788
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:43,751
We will have our independence.

789
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:45,751
Let Jinnah have his Pakistan.

790
00:52:45,835 --> 00:52:48,710
In five years' time, he will be knocking
at our door

791
00:52:48,793 --> 00:52:51,418
and begging to be part of India again.

792
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:56,710
It is not possible to divide the heart
and expect it to work.

793
00:52:56,793 --> 00:52:59,251
Gandhiji, how can we reach
an agreement with Jinnah

794
00:52:59,335 --> 00:53:01,210
if you can't agree with Jawahar?

795
00:53:01,293 --> 00:53:04,001
Every moment we debate
brings more violence.

796
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:09,251
We can concede the provinces
with a clear Muslim majority,

797
00:53:09,335 --> 00:53:12,710
but Jinnah cannot have Punjab
and Bengal.

798
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:15,543
They have large Hindu and
Sikh populations.

799
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:21,001
Then we must divide the two provinces
between the two countries.

800
00:53:21,085 --> 00:53:25,918
Half of the Punjab and
Bengal to India,

801
00:53:26,001 --> 00:53:28,960
the other half to Pakistan.

802
00:53:29,043 --> 00:53:30,835
Partition.

803
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:36,501
And which god among you
decides where the border falls?

804
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,710
You've spoken yourself about
the beauty of compromise.

805
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,418
This compromise will have
beauty, Bapu...

806
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:03,751
...because it will bring peace.

807
00:54:04,835 --> 00:54:07,626
The callouses on my feet,

808
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,418
the years in prison...

809
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:14,751
...the hopes and dreams of our people

810
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,668
were for independence,

811
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:19,585
not partition.

812
00:54:19,668 --> 00:54:22,626
No one is listening to Gandhiji.

813
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:25,501
Mountbatten sahib and Nehru
seem to agree.

814
00:54:25,585 --> 00:54:28,460
Pakistan will come to be.

815
00:54:28,543 --> 00:54:30,168
Ah, Allah be praised.

816
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:32,293
- Pakistan Zindabad.
- Our Pakistan.

817
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:35,793
Mohsin, our sisters are all in hiding
because of you animals.

818
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:38,126
You're the animals,
destroying the peace.

819
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,626
All religions are true.

820
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,293
We are brothers with one soul.

821
00:54:45,085 --> 00:54:47,835
To divide us on religious grounds...

822
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:50,376
is against the will of God.

823
00:54:51,626 --> 00:54:56,960
Division does not create peace.

824
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,501
It creates havoc.

825
00:54:58,585 --> 00:55:02,460
Partition unleashes passions.

826
00:55:02,543 --> 00:55:05,710
It does not dampen them.

827
00:55:05,793 --> 00:55:08,543
We shall tear ourselves asunder

828
00:55:08,626 --> 00:55:11,335
in the womb of the mother
who bears us.

829
00:55:11,418 --> 00:55:14,293
The Viceroy's house is not
for the likes of this.

830
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:17,251
You are dismissed, both of you.

831
00:55:24,293 --> 00:55:26,210
- Mohsin, no.
- Mohsin.

832
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,251
Get your things.

833
00:55:29,335 --> 00:55:31,793
The guards will escort you
from your quarters.

834
00:55:31,876 --> 00:55:32,960
We are guards.

835
00:55:33,043 --> 00:55:35,376
Us leave? It is you who have
no place here.

836
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,126
One more word,
I'll have you both arrested.

837
00:55:41,585 --> 00:55:45,585
Get them out of here!
Back to work!

838
00:55:45,668 --> 00:55:48,001
Come, let's go, please. Jaldi!

839
00:55:49,085 --> 00:55:50,668
Come on!

840
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,668
It's worse than Glasgow
on a Saturday night.

841
00:56:03,043 --> 00:56:04,418
Thank you, my friend.

842
00:56:06,543 --> 00:56:08,001
Thank you.

843
00:56:11,418 --> 00:56:15,293
What happened with Ewart and the staff?
You were there, were you?

844
00:56:15,376 --> 00:56:17,876
Yes, sir. It was terrible.

845
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,543
I've just seen Pug.

846
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,418
You're going to London with him?

847
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:25,501
We have to make the best possible
case to the government,

848
00:56:25,585 --> 00:56:29,543
get it to endorse partition and shock
the leaders out of their intransigence

849
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:31,126
by accelerating the process.

850
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,793
Otherwise the bloodshed will
continue.

851
00:56:32,876 --> 00:56:35,918
So when were you intending to tell me
you'd made your decision on partition?

852
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:37,418
It's the only way forward.

853
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:39,501
We've barely been here two months.

854
00:56:39,585 --> 00:56:41,210
And the country is burning.

855
00:56:41,293 --> 00:56:43,626
Dickie, there's no going back
on this decision.

856
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,001
There is no time for indecision.
I must act.

857
00:56:47,085 --> 00:56:51,751
You cannot change tack so hastily.
You are a statesman, not a sailor.

858
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:54,126
Edwina, people are dying every day!

859
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,710
Murders, rapes, reprisals,

860
00:56:55,793 --> 00:56:58,251
from Calcutta to Bombay,
Amritsar to Kahuta.

861
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:01,793
Imagine that repeated in every city
and village across India.

862
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,793
How much longer
do you want me to wait?

863
00:57:07,085 --> 00:57:09,126
How can it be getting worse
under us?

864
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,293
Precisely my point.

865
00:57:11,376 --> 00:57:13,251
We have no control.

866
00:57:13,335 --> 00:57:15,210
But a solution is in sight.

867
00:57:15,293 --> 00:57:16,960
But partition?

868
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:21,960
It may seem a good solution now,
but in the long term...

869
00:57:22,043 --> 00:57:24,918
It's hard enough negotiating
with them, Edwina.

870
00:57:31,376 --> 00:57:33,085
You have my support.

871
00:57:33,168 --> 00:57:35,501
But not your approval.

872
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,501
You don't need my approval.

873
00:57:37,585 --> 00:57:41,043
I have to persuade the prime minister,
Churchill, and the opposition.

874
00:57:41,126 --> 00:57:43,001
Heaven help me if I can't
persuade you.

875
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:47,293
We came to give India back
her freedom.

876
00:57:48,668 --> 00:57:50,460
Not to tear her apart.

877
00:57:50,543 --> 00:57:52,335
We have no choice.

878
00:57:52,418 --> 00:57:56,543
If we don't transfer power soon,
there may be nothing left to transfer.

879
00:58:04,376 --> 00:58:08,293
<i>The Viceroy arrives in Britain by air,
having returned for consultations</i>

880
00:58:08,376 --> 00:58:12,460
<i>of the utmost importance regarding
the British withdrawal from India.</i>

881
00:58:12,543 --> 00:58:16,460
<i>He can only hope that the Viceroy will
find a solution.</i>

882
00:58:16,543 --> 00:58:19,626
<i>With communal fighting increasing in
violence, especially in the Punjab,</i>

883
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:22,918
<i>the task of handing over is obviously
a tremendous problem.</i>

884
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:27,710
Curfews have been imposed
in Lahore and Calcutta,

885
00:58:27,793 --> 00:58:32,918
and large areas of Bengal
and the Punjab remain unsafe.

886
00:58:34,126 --> 00:58:39,960
Rawalpindi and its surrounding
villages are in a critical state.

887
00:58:40,043 --> 00:58:45,085
We know that some of you
have families in these areas.

888
00:58:45,168 --> 00:58:47,543
They may come to you here.

889
00:58:49,501 --> 00:58:51,668
<i>Basic accommodation
will be found</i>

890
00:58:51,751 --> 00:58:55,460
<i>and food will be rationed
to meet demand.</i>

891
00:58:55,543 --> 00:58:57,960
<i>A hardship fund has been
made available.</i>

892
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,043
- Pamela?
- I'm here, Aalia.

893
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:10,626
This child has a very high fever.

894
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:13,876
Yes, he's dehydrated.

895
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,960
In certain cases,
permission will be given

896
00:59:22,043 --> 00:59:25,585
for you to go and bring
your people back.

897
00:59:25,668 --> 00:59:27,210
I need to get back to our village.

898
00:59:27,293 --> 00:59:30,251
The refugees have told me terrible
things. I need to get home.

899
00:59:30,335 --> 00:59:31,710
Wait.

900
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:35,418
The violence is caused by uncertainty.

901
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:38,418
If the British do what Mountbatten says,

902
00:59:38,501 --> 00:59:40,668
he says the violence will stop.

903
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:43,001
And you believe him?

904
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:45,668
What country will our village be in?

905
00:59:45,751 --> 00:59:47,585
What if it's Pakistan?

906
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:51,418
There is a madness taking hold here,
a hatred.

907
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:53,376
It's soldiers deserting the army,

908
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:57,460
men from other towns
forming into gangs and militias.

909
00:59:57,543 --> 00:59:59,876
They want our land.

910
01:00:02,376 --> 01:00:04,751
- Well, then, I must go with you.
- No.

911
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:07,876
I need you to stay here.

912
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,960
What if they've left already?

913
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:14,335
What if they arrive here and we are gone?
You stay, I'll go.

914
01:00:33,835 --> 01:00:35,043
Have you seen this, sir?

915
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:06,085
- Ah.
- Welcome home, Daddy.

916
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:07,918
Thank you, darling.

917
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:10,793
- How was Westminster?
- Deliciously cool.

918
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,001
The cabinet passed the plan
in the blink of an eye.

919
01:01:13,085 --> 01:01:15,960
We got the green light
to speed up independence.

920
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:17,043
What about Churchill?

921
01:01:17,126 --> 01:01:20,251
He was quite sanguine.
Accepted the plan.

922
01:01:20,335 --> 01:01:21,918
He was very complimentary.

923
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:24,585
He pointed out that Dickie has,
in a matter of weeks,

924
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:28,335
achieved what Wavell and
all the previous Viceroys

925
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,835
failed to achieve in years.

926
01:01:32,251 --> 01:01:37,335
The government and the press
are calling it the Mountbatten Plan.

927
01:01:38,501 --> 01:01:40,043
Well done.

928
01:01:42,793 --> 01:01:45,460
The Mountbatten Plan?

929
01:01:47,251 --> 01:01:49,626
Mr Jinnah, what is your solution
to end the violence?

930
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:53,210
- Is partition the only way?
- Is Pakistan the answer?

931
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:56,293
Mr Jinnah, what will you be doing
to stop the escalating violence?

932
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:58,293
Mr Nehru, a moment, please.

933
01:01:58,376 --> 01:02:02,085
Mr Nehru, do you have the support
of the Indian National Congress?

934
01:02:02,168 --> 01:02:04,585
What is your answer for freedom
in India, please, Mr Nehru?

935
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:13,168
Now... Why has Gandhi not attended?

936
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:18,376
He apologises but he cannot assent
to the Mountbatten Plan.

937
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,126
But will he go against it?

938
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:23,543
- Will he try to speak out, to sabotage...
- Bapuji has informed me

939
01:02:23,626 --> 01:02:26,751
that today is his day of silence.

940
01:02:28,418 --> 01:02:31,960
Why must everything now be rushed?

941
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:34,751
I wanted all of the Punjab and Bengal.

942
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:38,835
You expect me to accept
a moth-eaten Pakistan?

943
01:02:38,918 --> 01:02:41,251
You should be grateful.

944
01:02:41,335 --> 01:02:43,751
You've held us to ransom
for long enough.

945
01:02:43,835 --> 01:02:46,585
- Mr Nehru, it is you...
- I am chairing this meeting

946
01:02:46,668 --> 01:02:49,751
and I demand that we respect
one another.

947
01:02:49,835 --> 01:02:53,543
The British cabinet has formally
approved the partition of India.

948
01:02:53,626 --> 01:02:55,585
By the end of this meeting,
it is my intention

949
01:02:55,668 --> 01:03:00,001
that all parties will accept the plan
and our new timeline.

950
01:03:00,085 --> 01:03:01,918
Impossible.

951
01:03:02,001 --> 01:03:03,085
We'll need a week at least

952
01:03:03,168 --> 01:03:05,293
to get formal approval from
the Muslim League.

953
01:03:05,376 --> 01:03:07,460
I can't hold this position for a week.

954
01:03:07,543 --> 01:03:09,251
You've got your Pakistan,

955
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:11,876
which at one time no one in the world
thought you'd get.

956
01:03:13,668 --> 01:03:18,293
If I don't have your agreement,
this plan will collapse,

957
01:03:18,376 --> 01:03:23,251
and the country that you have conjured
out of thin air will disappear.

958
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:28,335
What about the borders?

959
01:03:28,418 --> 01:03:30,293
Who decides?

960
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:34,418
And where exactly is this Pakistan
we are signing for?

961
01:03:34,501 --> 01:03:37,585
The cabinet has appointed
Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a barrister,

962
01:03:37,668 --> 01:03:39,293
to chair the border commission.

963
01:03:39,376 --> 01:03:42,501
<i>He will be assisted by members of
the Muslim League and by Congress.</i>

964
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:44,710
<i>It will be a wholly impartial process.</i>

965
01:03:56,335 --> 01:04:00,960
They say, don't they, that tea is
actually cooling in the hot weather?

966
01:04:01,043 --> 01:04:05,501
- Would you like it cool, sir?
- No, no. No, thank you.

967
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,251
- Sir Cyril, welcome.
- Your Excellency.

968
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,543
Good to see you.

969
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:17,960
- You know Lord Ismay.
- Everyone knows Pug, sir.

970
01:04:18,043 --> 01:04:20,501
You've come in the hottest summer
for 75 years,

971
01:04:20,585 --> 01:04:22,085
114 degrees in the shade.

972
01:04:22,168 --> 01:04:25,126
- I'll adjust, I'm sure.
- You don't mind if I...

973
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:27,043
Now, Atlee's told you of the task.

974
01:04:27,126 --> 01:04:30,335
Yes, you want a fair decision
on a boundary line

975
01:04:30,418 --> 01:04:33,876
dividing 90 million Muslims, Sikhs
and Hindus.

976
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,918
Quite so.
Tea with milk.

977
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:38,335
And you want it by
August 15th.

978
01:04:38,418 --> 01:04:39,668
Actually, that's one day shy.

979
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:42,835
I've agreed to move the date up to
midnight of August 14th

980
01:04:42,918 --> 01:04:45,126
to satisfy the astrologers.

981
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,501
That's less than five weeks.

982
01:04:46,585 --> 01:04:48,543
You'll have a small team working
with you.

983
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:51,793
They'll be representing
all the parties concerned.

984
01:04:51,876 --> 01:04:57,418
We'll provide you with maps,
census figures, geographical data,

985
01:04:57,501 --> 01:05:00,835
and any other information you require.

986
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:05,960
You're asking me to draw a line
through people's houses,

987
01:05:06,043 --> 01:05:09,168
rice paddies, jute fields...

988
01:05:09,251 --> 01:05:13,960
Look, I understand.
It's a daunting proposition, yes.

989
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:19,210
And we all accept that some anomalies
will be inevitable.

990
01:05:19,293 --> 01:05:22,251
Radcliffe, how well do you know
Bengal and the Punjab?

991
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,001
I assumed Pug would have
told you, sir.

992
01:05:25,085 --> 01:05:27,251
I've never set foot in India in my life.

993
01:05:31,543 --> 01:05:33,835
What I don't understand is 15 August.

994
01:05:33,918 --> 01:05:35,626
That's just a few weeks away.

995
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:38,960
Why so soon, huh? They were
supposed to leave next year.

996
01:05:39,043 --> 01:05:41,543
They don't want to be accountable
for the carnage.

997
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:44,460
Mountbatten sahib is trying
to prevent carnage.

998
01:05:44,543 --> 01:05:46,251
That is why he moved the date.

999
01:05:46,335 --> 01:05:49,210
You listen to his faithful serving boy.

1000
01:05:50,793 --> 01:05:52,501
People need certainty.

1001
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:55,460
That is his intention.

1002
01:05:55,543 --> 01:06:00,668
Jeet, intentions are one thing.
Actions another.

1003
01:06:00,751 --> 01:06:02,918
The British are like rats
leaving a sinking ship.

1004
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:08,001
They say the gutters in Lahore
are flowing like rivers of blood.

1005
01:06:08,085 --> 01:06:11,460
People killing each other when
we've lived together for centuries.

1006
01:06:11,543 --> 01:06:13,626
- The army is deserting.
- Listen to me...

1007
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:16,710
Soldiers keeping their weapons,
groups of militia running wild.

1008
01:06:16,793 --> 01:06:19,626
Listen to me, this is nothing
but a lawless land grab.

1009
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:22,876
How is Mountbatten sahib
going to stop all the violence?

1010
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,501
<i>Vast mobs have been out
in the streets of Bombay</i>

1011
01:06:25,585 --> 01:06:28,501
<i>during six days of violence that have
included murder,</i>

1012
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:30,710
<i>as well as wrecking, burning
and looting,</i>

1013
01:06:30,793 --> 01:06:32,168
<i>a question of state boundaries.</i>

1014
01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:35,043
<i>Curfew was one of the methods
adopted in Delhi</i>

1015
01:06:35,126 --> 01:06:38,376
<i>in an attempt to get the communal
fighting under control.</i>

1016
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,835
<i>So one part of the picture shows
empty streets and locked doors.</i>

1017
01:06:42,918 --> 01:06:46,043
<i>The other picture of Delhi shows
mob violence, the looting of shops,</i>

1018
01:06:46,126 --> 01:06:48,876
<i>and the consequent loss of life
and destruction of property.</i>

1019
01:07:08,626 --> 01:07:09,835
Ubba?

1020
01:07:09,918 --> 01:07:11,126
Ubba!

1021
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:14,168
Aalia! Wait, wait, wait.

1022
01:07:17,668 --> 01:07:19,501
What happened? Where is Ubba?

1023
01:07:21,501 --> 01:07:23,668
Where are you, sir? Aalia?

1024
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,126
Cowards!

1025
01:07:29,585 --> 01:07:31,710
Don't you know me?

1026
01:07:31,793 --> 01:07:34,501
Don't you know my father?

1027
01:07:34,585 --> 01:07:35,668
Where's Ubba?

1028
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,710
No violence will be
tolerated in Viceroy's House.

1029
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:43,335
Perpetrators will be dismissed and
jailed, their families told to leave.

1030
01:07:43,418 --> 01:07:45,293
Ubba? Ubba!

1031
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:50,960
The harshest measures will be taken.
There will be no riot here!

1032
01:07:51,043 --> 01:07:54,168
It's time for us
to come together now.

1033
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:58,335
What we face is the most significant
moment

1034
01:07:58,418 --> 01:08:01,251
in the history of this sub-continent.

1035
01:08:01,335 --> 01:08:05,126
Our children and our grandchildren

1036
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:08,376
may one day ask us how we served.

1037
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:14,126
We must ensure we can be proud
of what we say.

1038
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,793
In less than 30 days now,
India will be divided.

1039
01:08:19,043 --> 01:08:22,960
The partition council has agreed
that the national assets and debt

1040
01:08:23,043 --> 01:08:28,501
will be apportioned 80% to India
and 20% to Pakistan.

1041
01:08:28,585 --> 01:08:32,418
We will be following that same
formula in this great house.

1042
01:08:32,501 --> 01:08:33,918
Finally...

1043
01:08:35,168 --> 01:08:37,251
...and I am sorry to say this...

1044
01:08:38,835 --> 01:08:42,126
...each one of you must choose which
country will have your allegiance,

1045
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:43,835
India...

1046
01:08:43,918 --> 01:08:45,126
or Pakistan.

1047
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,543
Suhara Kapur, India.

1048
01:09:00,626 --> 01:09:02,085
Next.

1049
01:09:02,168 --> 01:09:03,876
I, too. Pakistan.

1050
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,626
Next.

1051
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:09,418
Sanjit Gupta.

1052
01:09:09,501 --> 01:09:10,960
India.

1053
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:12,626
Next.

1054
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,168
Mr Ali.

1055
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:16,293
Sir, I want to go to Pakistan.

1056
01:09:16,376 --> 01:09:17,835
I wish you well.

1057
01:09:17,918 --> 01:09:22,376
Jeet, what's going to happen to us?

1058
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,960
Come.

1059
01:09:25,043 --> 01:09:26,793
- I'm so scared.
- Come.

1060
01:09:28,418 --> 01:09:32,251
Soup spoons, 15 cases for India,
three cases for Pakistan.

1061
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:36,418
Teaspoons, 40 cases for India,
ten cases for Pakistan.

1062
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:40,835
Butter knives, 20 cases for India,
five cases for Pakistan.

1063
01:09:40,918 --> 01:09:42,835
Tuba, India.

1064
01:09:42,918 --> 01:09:44,918
French horn, Pakistan.

1065
01:09:50,001 --> 01:09:53,626
Right, what do the latest reports say?

1066
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:55,876
Ah, well, that we know about.

1067
01:09:57,376 --> 01:09:59,918
India. Pakistan.

1068
01:10:01,668 --> 01:10:04,210
- India.
- Next!

1069
01:10:07,168 --> 01:10:09,668
Pakistan.

1070
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:12,085
India. Pakistan.

1071
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,251
India. Pakistan.

1072
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:32,960
I don't know what to do.

1073
01:10:35,293 --> 01:10:37,793
Your father's a good man.

1074
01:10:37,876 --> 01:10:40,168
He'll understand.

1075
01:10:40,251 --> 01:10:41,585
Aalia.

1076
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,626
We belong together.

1077
01:10:47,418 --> 01:10:48,918
Take this kara.

1078
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:52,126
It shows our unity.

1079
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,168
I'm scared.

1080
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:03,001
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> must come to
Pakistan.

1081
01:11:03,085 --> 01:11:06,251
Then <i>Jane Eyre</i> stays here
and all of the Jane Austen.

1082
01:11:06,335 --> 01:11:08,293
India. Pakistan.

1083
01:11:08,376 --> 01:11:11,293
But we can't break the encyclopaedias.
That would be a crime.

1084
01:11:11,376 --> 01:11:16,501
No, 20% comes to Pakistan.
A to E or S to Z?

1085
01:11:16,585 --> 01:11:18,543
- Give me A to E.
- This is absurd.

1086
01:11:20,918 --> 01:11:22,793
<i>Where communities are so mixed</i>

1087
01:11:22,876 --> 01:11:24,960
<i>it is of course impossible to draw
boundaries</i>

1088
01:11:25,043 --> 01:11:28,501
<i>which will segregate Hindus on
the one hand, Muslims on the other.</i>

1089
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:31,335
<i>Fires raged unchecked in many
places</i>

1090
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:34,460
<i>while pitched battles continued
between Muslims and Hindus.</i>

1091
01:11:34,543 --> 01:11:37,835
<i>Casualties totalled 3,000 killed
and 8,000 injured.</i>

1092
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:39,960
Very well. Thank you. Where?

1093
01:12:23,793 --> 01:12:26,001
Ubba, are you comfortable?

1094
01:12:26,085 --> 01:12:27,293
Aalia!

1095
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:33,001
I have to take my father to Lahore.

1096
01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:36,043
Asif has very kindly agreed
to take us to the station.

1097
01:12:36,126 --> 01:12:39,210
My father is my first
responsibility, Jeet.

1098
01:12:39,293 --> 01:12:42,876
- I have to do what's best for him.
- Running away isn't best for him.

1099
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,751
I'm trying to keep him alive.

1100
01:12:44,835 --> 01:12:46,460
It's all changed now.

1101
01:12:48,293 --> 01:12:51,793
When people see us, they don't see
Indians any more. We're Muslims.

1102
01:12:51,876 --> 01:12:54,626
Aalia, you are as Indian as I am.

1103
01:12:55,918 --> 01:13:00,043
- India is what we make it.
- Don't make it any harder, please.

1104
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:03,168
Aalia, please, I am begging you,
don't do this.

1105
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:04,835
Aalia, are you ready, beta?

1106
01:13:04,918 --> 01:13:07,168
- Just a minute, Abba.
- Who's there?

1107
01:13:07,251 --> 01:13:08,543
Jeet Kumar, sir.

1108
01:13:08,626 --> 01:13:11,751
We have to go.
Our train leaves at midnight.

1109
01:13:11,835 --> 01:13:15,210
I hear you helped Aalia and Ubba
when the house was set on fire.

1110
01:13:15,293 --> 01:13:17,793
I thank you for everything that you did.

1111
01:13:19,085 --> 01:13:22,710
My mother and brother will be at
the station in Lahore to receive you.

1112
01:13:22,793 --> 01:13:25,876
My home will be your home
just as soon as we're married.

1113
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:29,001
- Tell him. Tell him, Aalia.
- Tell me what?

1114
01:13:32,043 --> 01:13:35,960
I know right now
it's the hardest thing to stay,

1115
01:13:36,043 --> 01:13:37,543
but you are brave.

1116
01:13:39,376 --> 01:13:41,585
- And your father...
- He has to be safe.

1117
01:13:44,543 --> 01:13:46,835
My father must be safe.

1118
01:13:52,668 --> 01:13:54,168
Goodbye, Jeet.

1119
01:13:59,543 --> 01:14:01,001
- We have to go now.
- Kumar?

1120
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,960
I never thought this would
happen to my country.

1121
01:14:14,626 --> 01:14:16,501
But I must, for my daughter's sake.

1122
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:22,710
Is your future still clouded, my friend?

1123
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:26,668
Have you spoken yet
to your young woman?

1124
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,668
Yes, sir.

1125
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:35,460
It won't happen.

1126
01:14:35,543 --> 01:14:36,835
Why not?

1127
01:14:38,168 --> 01:14:39,668
Because she is leaving...

1128
01:14:41,335 --> 01:14:43,460
...on a train for Pakistan.

1129
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:54,793
It's been an honour knowing you, sir.

1130
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:14,835
We have to go.

1131
01:15:28,126 --> 01:15:30,168
We'll be safe in Pakistan, Ubba.

1132
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:05,460
Well, this really is splendid!

1133
01:16:05,543 --> 01:16:08,793
Mr Nehru, we in America are
well aware

1134
01:16:08,876 --> 01:16:10,751
of your admiration for
the Soviet Union.

1135
01:16:10,835 --> 01:16:12,585
I admire America too, Mr Grady.

1136
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:14,918
Good, I'm glad to hear that.

1137
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:18,126
There is a lot that America can do here.

1138
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:20,001
After freeing ourselves from
one empire,

1139
01:16:20,085 --> 01:16:22,793
we'll not get too close to another.

1140
01:16:22,876 --> 01:16:25,335
India must go her own way.

1141
01:16:25,418 --> 01:16:26,793
Excuse me, sir.

1142
01:16:26,876 --> 01:16:29,376
Mr Radcliffe would like to speak
with you.

1143
01:16:31,376 --> 01:16:33,293
With your permission, sir, I'll go.

1144
01:16:36,918 --> 01:16:39,335
I strongly think we need more time.

1145
01:16:39,418 --> 01:16:40,585
Sit down.

1146
01:16:40,668 --> 01:16:43,960
Pug, I don't know if you really
understand,

1147
01:16:44,043 --> 01:16:48,876
but the commission is in deadlock
with every city we come to,

1148
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,710
and I'm most concerned about
the fairness of the thing.

1149
01:16:52,793 --> 01:16:55,793
I wonder if we might not involve
some other body.

1150
01:16:55,876 --> 01:16:57,835
What other body?

1151
01:16:57,918 --> 01:17:00,293
The United Nations, for example.

1152
01:17:00,376 --> 01:17:04,460
And admit that we British
can't see to our own affairs?

1153
01:17:04,543 --> 01:17:08,710
With respect, it's a monstrous
responsibility for just one man.

1154
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:15,335
I'm going to go and see Mountbatten.

1155
01:17:15,418 --> 01:17:18,626
Dickie has to stay impartial.
You know that.

1156
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:23,085
If he comes down on either side,
the whole thing will blow up.

1157
01:17:23,168 --> 01:17:25,585
It's got to be a clean cut.

1158
01:17:25,668 --> 01:17:30,418
It's a bloody axe, Pug, cleaving
right through people's lives.

1159
01:17:37,335 --> 01:17:40,793
This might be everything you need.

1160
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:55,376
It's a policy document drawn up by
Churchill when he was Prime Minister.

1161
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,210
Two years ago.

1162
01:17:57,293 --> 01:17:59,876
It sets out the future of India.

1163
01:18:03,168 --> 01:18:05,293
It should make your task easier.

1164
01:18:09,335 --> 01:18:10,460
What's this map?

1165
01:18:10,543 --> 01:18:14,085
It was drawn up by Viceroy Wavell
last year.

1166
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:19,043
I don't understand. There's already
a boundary line there.

1167
01:18:19,126 --> 01:18:21,543
I've been asked to pass it on to you.

1168
01:18:21,626 --> 01:18:24,210
By whom? Mountbatten?

1169
01:18:24,293 --> 01:18:26,668
No. He knows nothing of it.

1170
01:18:27,751 --> 01:18:31,543
This comes right from the top, Radcliffe.

1171
01:18:31,626 --> 01:18:37,585
We didn't beat the Nazis and the Japs
to give away the shop to the Soviets.

1172
01:18:41,626 --> 01:18:45,960
As you can see, there are no
straight lines in India.

1173
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:57,168
Good heavens!

1174
01:19:02,418 --> 01:19:05,501
There are hundreds coming every day.

1175
01:19:05,585 --> 01:19:07,376
Thousands in the city.

1176
01:19:08,626 --> 01:19:10,168
The stories they tell...

1177
01:19:12,168 --> 01:19:15,043
This isn't part of Daddy's plan, is it?

1178
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:23,043
This way, this way.
Please, keep moving. Keep moving.

1179
01:19:40,585 --> 01:19:42,418
Duleep!

1180
01:19:43,501 --> 01:19:45,043
What happened?

1181
01:19:45,126 --> 01:19:47,751
Are any of our family here?

1182
01:19:48,835 --> 01:19:49,918
No.

1183
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:53,168
Then I was... I was too late.

1184
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:55,001
It was destroyed.

1185
01:19:55,085 --> 01:19:57,668
- What?
- Our village. They're all gone.

1186
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:02,793
Men came from miles around,
destroying.

1187
01:20:02,876 --> 01:20:05,126
Our families are gone.

1188
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:08,210
My mother? My sisters?

1189
01:20:08,293 --> 01:20:10,460
I couldn't find them.

1190
01:20:10,543 --> 01:20:13,710
I hope to God they are in
a refugee camp somewhere.

1191
01:20:13,793 --> 01:20:16,376
This girl I found in a barn.

1192
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,376
The only one left.

1193
01:20:21,043 --> 01:20:24,418
All the way back, the dead lying
by the road.

1194
01:20:24,501 --> 01:20:27,960
Women jumped in the well
rather than be raped.

1195
01:20:48,085 --> 01:20:50,626
Sir, the boundary line is drawn.

1196
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:56,626
We shan't announce this until after
the independence celebrations.

1197
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:58,460
Why on earth?

1198
01:20:58,543 --> 01:21:02,085
The pressure I've been under
to produce that by today.

1199
01:21:02,168 --> 01:21:04,918
Let them have the joy of
their independence days

1200
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:07,418
and face the misery of
the situation afterwards.

1201
01:21:08,501 --> 01:21:11,876
There will be carnage, sir,
either way.

1202
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:16,626
All the leaders believe that partition
will reduce the violence, not inflame it.

1203
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:18,876
I've done a wholly inadequate job.

1204
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:22,043
I'm sorry you think so.

1205
01:21:22,126 --> 01:21:26,126
In all conscience, I cannot accept my fee.

1206
01:21:30,918 --> 01:21:32,710
I believe...

1207
01:21:32,793 --> 01:21:34,710
that you rather love this country.

1208
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,960
I think you deserve to know.

1209
01:22:25,501 --> 01:22:28,043
Our porter is ready to load.

1210
01:22:32,376 --> 01:22:35,210
Do you think we'll have enough?

1211
01:22:35,293 --> 01:22:38,960
There are too many people,
Lady Sahib.

1212
01:22:39,043 --> 01:22:42,668
If we work all night,
we would still not have enough.

1213
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:45,751
Let me see what I can do.

1214
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,751
Which train did Aalia take?

1215
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:05,251
The night train, the last train.

1216
01:23:12,668 --> 01:23:14,376
It says there are no survivors.

1217
01:23:50,251 --> 01:23:52,710
- Dickie, the refugees...
- Not now.

1218
01:23:58,418 --> 01:24:00,001
Please leave us.

1219
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,126
This is why Jinnah wouldn't budge.

1220
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:10,043
He'd already been promised
his Pakistan!

1221
01:24:10,126 --> 01:24:12,210
Why the hell did no one tell me?

1222
01:24:12,293 --> 01:24:14,418
So you could better do your job.

1223
01:24:14,501 --> 01:24:18,210
My job? Double-dealing
with men I've come to revere?

1224
01:24:18,293 --> 01:24:20,543
What do you mean, double-dealing?

1225
01:24:20,626 --> 01:24:24,835
You were perfectly honest,
and they gave you their trust,

1226
01:24:24,918 --> 01:24:26,251
as we hoped they would.

1227
01:24:26,335 --> 01:24:29,168
So I could urge them
to your foregone conclusion?

1228
01:24:29,251 --> 01:24:32,960
We have to protect our interests here.

1229
01:24:33,043 --> 01:24:34,585
Churchill can see it.

1230
01:24:34,668 --> 01:24:36,001
See what?

1231
01:24:36,085 --> 01:24:37,793
The future.

1232
01:24:37,876 --> 01:24:42,543
Look at the map.
Look at where the power will lie.

1233
01:24:42,626 --> 01:24:44,918
The Gulf, oil.

1234
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:50,335
We need to secure our access,
you see, to these huge reserves,

1235
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:53,543
and block access by others.

1236
01:24:53,626 --> 01:24:57,918
We'll have that security,
courtesy of Pakistan.

1237
01:24:59,585 --> 01:25:02,210
You've divided India for oil?

1238
01:25:02,293 --> 01:25:05,585
For security.

1239
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:07,626
There's a Soviet empire.

1240
01:25:08,751 --> 01:25:13,210
Stalin needs a warm-water
eastern port.

1241
01:25:13,293 --> 01:25:17,043
He's had his sights set on Karachi.

1242
01:25:17,126 --> 01:25:19,626
He won't get it now.

1243
01:25:19,710 --> 01:25:21,626
Pakistan will be easier to influence

1244
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:24,335
than an unruly India with
its socialist leanings?

1245
01:25:24,418 --> 01:25:26,168
Is that what you imagine?

1246
01:25:26,251 --> 01:25:28,585
It's not my place to imagine.

1247
01:25:28,668 --> 01:25:32,043
You have used me and my family.

1248
01:25:32,126 --> 01:25:35,126
You came here to serve
your king and country

1249
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:37,835
and you've done so admirably.

1250
01:25:37,918 --> 01:25:41,085
I hear they're promoting you
from Viscount to Earl.

1251
01:25:42,835 --> 01:25:46,126
What about the people whose lives
have been destroyed by this?

1252
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:48,043
That is unfortunate.

1253
01:25:48,126 --> 01:25:51,501
- Nobody foresaw...
- Blood is on your hands for this.

1254
01:25:51,585 --> 01:25:53,751
But Dickie...

1255
01:25:53,835 --> 01:25:55,543
it's your name on the plan.

1256
01:25:57,210 --> 01:26:00,251
It will always be known
as the Mountbatten Plan.

1257
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:06,126
Good evening, Your Excellency.

1258
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,376
What the hell is this?

1259
01:26:47,626 --> 01:26:49,293
You said you would protect us.

1260
01:26:51,126 --> 01:26:53,085
You have torn India to pieces.

1261
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:04,251
- Everyone I loved is dead.
- Kumar...

1262
01:27:04,335 --> 01:27:06,751
Is this the price that we pay
for our freedom?

1263
01:27:06,835 --> 01:27:11,293
I have seen many young men
lose loved ones in the war.

1264
01:27:12,376 --> 01:27:15,001
- And in time...
- You have lost no one, nothing!

1265
01:27:16,210 --> 01:27:19,251
In time, you will go back
to England, untouched.

1266
01:27:20,585 --> 01:27:22,251
You will forget what you have
done here.

1267
01:27:22,335 --> 01:27:24,001
Never.

1268
01:27:27,918 --> 01:27:31,043
I cannot serve you any more, sir.

1269
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:35,168
I hope you never know
a moment's peace again.

1270
01:27:51,876 --> 01:27:53,543
We shan't go home.

1271
01:27:54,793 --> 01:27:57,626
After the transfer of power,
we'll stay on.

1272
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:00,210
We must.

1273
01:28:00,293 --> 01:28:02,793
We'll do everything we can.

1274
01:28:03,876 --> 01:28:06,418
This tragedy was not of your making.

1275
01:28:38,585 --> 01:28:40,418
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1276
01:28:40,501 --> 01:28:41,835
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1277
01:28:41,918 --> 01:28:43,460
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1278
01:28:43,543 --> 01:28:45,376
- Hindustan!
- Zindabad!

1279
01:29:05,293 --> 01:29:07,543
<i>The gate of freedom is open in India</i>

1280
01:29:07,626 --> 01:29:10,501
<i>as thousands of Hindus in New Delhi
swarm the streets,</i>

1281
01:29:10,585 --> 01:29:13,626
<i>awaiting their hour of liberation.</i>

1282
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:17,210
<i>In Karachi, capital of the newly
created Muslim state of Pakistan,</i>

1283
01:29:17,293 --> 01:29:21,001
<i>Lord Louis Mountbatten,
last Viceroy of India,</i>

1284
01:29:21,085 --> 01:29:24,001
<i>arrives to take part in the official end
of British rule.</i>

1285
01:29:33,626 --> 01:29:36,751
I am pleased you can share
in the joyous birth of our nation.

1286
01:29:36,835 --> 01:29:39,668
The impossible dream is a reality.

1287
01:29:39,751 --> 01:29:44,126
It shouldn't be me standing here with
you. It should be Churchill.

1288
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:47,543
He's the midwife who delivered you
your Pakistan.

1289
01:29:47,626 --> 01:29:52,168
I did what any leader would do
to realise his people's dreams.

1290
01:29:53,668 --> 01:29:55,960
The truth is we've both been used.

1291
01:29:56,043 --> 01:29:57,751
But you got what you wanted.

1292
01:29:57,835 --> 01:30:02,251
I got only half the country I wanted.

1293
01:30:04,668 --> 01:30:07,751
We will always fear for our existence.

1294
01:30:07,835 --> 01:30:12,543
The British, on the other hand,
got everything they were playing for.

1295
01:30:12,626 --> 01:30:14,960
You are the victors here.

1296
01:30:16,418 --> 01:30:19,876
Predicting the future is a dangerous game.

1297
01:30:21,168 --> 01:30:23,835
I fear there will be no victors here.

1298
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:25,710
<i>I have a letter</i>

1299
01:30:25,793 --> 01:30:30,460
<i>from President Harry S Truman
of the United States of America.</i>

1300
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:34,293
<i>Congratulations to Pakistan</i>

1301
01:30:34,376 --> 01:30:39,626
<i>on its emergence among the family
of nations.</i>

1302
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:44,585
<i>Long years ago we made a tryst
with destiny,</i>

1303
01:30:44,668 --> 01:30:49,085
<i>and now the time comes when
we shall redeem our pledge.</i>

1304
01:30:49,168 --> 01:30:54,126
<i>At the stroke of the midnight hour,
when the world sleeps,</i>

1305
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:58,251
<i>India will wake to life and freedom.</i>

1306
01:31:00,751 --> 01:31:06,168
<i>Pakistan shall be a secular country,
where all shall be welcome,</i>

1307
01:31:06,251 --> 01:31:10,668
<i>and I assure you that
we shall not be wanting</i>

1308
01:31:10,751 --> 01:31:13,751
<i>in friendly spirit with our neighbours.</i>

1309
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:18,751
<i>We have to build the noble mansion
of free India,</i>

1310
01:31:18,835 --> 01:31:22,085
<i>but our freedom is only possible</i>

1311
01:31:22,168 --> 01:31:26,251
<i>because millions have
suffered and sacrificed.</i>

1312
01:31:26,335 --> 01:31:30,043
<i>We pledge to them to build a free India</i>

1313
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:32,876
<i>where all her children may flourish.</i>

1314
01:31:49,418 --> 01:31:51,126
Shouldn't we wake Bapuji?

1315
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:59,251
He's fine, he's sleeping.
He said there's nothing to celebrate.

1316
01:32:10,918 --> 01:32:14,168
<i>One million people become refugees
overnight.</i>

1317
01:32:14,251 --> 01:32:18,168
<i>Carrying their few possessions,
they flee from savagery and butchery</i>

1318
01:32:18,251 --> 01:32:21,626
<i>that has never been exceeded
even in India's stormy history.</i>

1319
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:36,876
<i>Another two million are preparing
for their trek.</i>

1320
01:32:48,043 --> 01:32:50,376
<i>Many will never reach their new land.</i>

1321
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:53,126
<i>The refugee problem is immense.</i>

1322
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:55,751
<i>Smallpox and cholera are reported
from their camps.</i>

1323
01:33:00,335 --> 01:33:02,168
Bibi Harmeet Kaur...

1324
01:33:02,251 --> 01:33:03,710
Jahlad Singh...

1325
01:33:45,751 --> 01:33:50,126
We ask for your patience, please.
There is enough food for everyone.

1326
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:53,043
Please, move.

1327
01:33:57,126 --> 01:33:59,460
- Give to the children.
- Feed the children first.

1328
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,668
Make sure the children...

1329
01:34:02,751 --> 01:34:04,751
Show me.

1330
01:34:06,918 --> 01:34:10,126
They haven't got enough food. Make
sure supplies are getting through.

1331
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:15,710
Chandan Devi, Mandeep Singh,
Faishala Wad...

1332
01:34:32,168 --> 01:34:34,293
Sorry.

1333
01:34:34,376 --> 01:34:35,626
Nehruji.

1334
01:34:37,835 --> 01:34:39,835
Bring back my family.

1335
01:34:39,918 --> 01:34:41,793
I want my family back.

1336
01:34:44,293 --> 01:34:47,085
Forgive me, forgive me.

1337
01:35:09,335 --> 01:35:12,210
Daddy? Daddy?

1338
01:35:12,293 --> 01:35:14,501
Let's not have this.

1339
01:35:14,585 --> 01:35:16,710
Can't let the side down.

1340
01:35:16,793 --> 01:35:18,418
Not in public.

1341
01:35:32,376 --> 01:35:34,418
Some help over here, please.

1342
01:35:36,835 --> 01:35:39,668
My daughter.
My daughter, she is very sick.

1343
01:35:39,751 --> 01:35:42,543
This one is very weak, half-starved.
Jeet, find a stretcher!

1344
01:36:16,876 --> 01:36:19,751
Father's name?

1345
01:36:19,835 --> 01:36:22,460
- My daughter, she is very sick.
- What is your family name?

1346
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:27,043
Bibi Jind Kaur Bedi,
Machine Mala, one.

1347
01:36:27,126 --> 01:36:28,710
District Jhelum.

1348
01:36:28,793 --> 01:36:32,001
- And your daughter?
- I had a daughter like her.

1349
01:36:32,085 --> 01:36:34,210
A mob took her away.

1350
01:36:34,293 --> 01:36:36,918
I found this girl on the railway tracks.

1351
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:41,335
He father pushed her off the train
before everyone was killed.

1352
01:36:41,418 --> 01:36:42,918
So she is a Muslim.

1353
01:36:43,001 --> 01:36:44,335
- She must go to other camp.
- No.

1354
01:36:44,418 --> 01:36:46,852
- She's my daughter now.
- These are rules you have to follow.

1355
01:36:46,876 --> 01:36:51,001
We all suffer the same way, no?
Please try to understand.

1356
01:36:51,085 --> 01:36:53,043
- I can't allow it!
- Please try.

1357
01:36:53,126 --> 01:36:56,960
Please try to understand, beta.
She's my daughter now.

1358
01:37:00,418 --> 01:37:02,335
Jeet? Jeet?

1359
01:37:14,793 --> 01:37:16,418
Sorry, sorry.

1360
01:37:16,501 --> 01:37:19,043
My daughter is very sick.

1361
01:37:25,168 --> 01:37:26,876
Jeet?

1362
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,585
<i>Jeet Kumar?</i>

1363
01:37:29,876 --> 01:37:31,293
<i>Jeet?</i>

1364
01:37:33,626 --> 01:37:35,668
<i>Jeet?</i>

1365
01:37:35,751 --> 01:37:37,626
Hey, stop, please!

1366
01:37:40,835 --> 01:37:43,335
Jeet?

1367
01:37:43,418 --> 01:37:45,210
Sorry, no, ma'am.

1368
01:37:55,835 --> 01:37:57,585
Aalia?

1369
01:37:57,668 --> 01:38:01,085
<i>- Narinder Singh...</i>
- Aalia Noor? Aalia Noor?

1370
01:38:01,168 --> 01:38:03,085
- Go back to line.
- Noor, Aalia.

1371
01:38:03,168 --> 01:38:06,251
Sir, let me assure you,
we're doing all we can.

1372
01:38:06,335 --> 01:38:09,876
Yes, we will. It's coming.
Darling, water's coming.

1373
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:13,251
- There's more water coming.
- There are more water vases coming.

1374
01:38:13,335 --> 01:38:17,085
Now, for the time being, I would like
all families to stick together.

1375
01:38:20,043 --> 01:38:22,418
Aalia!

1376
01:38:25,626 --> 01:38:27,543
Aalia!

1377
01:38:27,626 --> 01:38:29,626
Jeet!

1378
01:38:29,710 --> 01:38:31,876
- Aalia!
- Jeet!

1379
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:35,085
Jeet!

1380
01:38:35,168 --> 01:38:37,251
Jeet!
