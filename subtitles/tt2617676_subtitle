They chased us out coz

82
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:21,755
They disqualified us after
all the hard work we put.

83
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,687
All wasted.
Let's go back.

84

Will he be sad coz we're not
selected because of his own action?!

88

00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:07,868
Why did you guys ask me
to come here urgently?

96
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:12,071
You know l doesn't like dance right.

102
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:42,762
Why are you keep on searching for lndian
girl just because you promised your dad?!

103
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:45,465
Why don't you just get
married with a foreign girl.

104
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:48,800
lt won't happen.
-Why?

105
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,105
Here they have boyfriends
in the age of 10.

106
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:53,247
l can't go down as that...

107
00:21:54,783 --> 00:21:56,216
So you're saying
foreign girls are waste?

108
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:58,046
lt's not like that.

109
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:03,785
lt is good as a girlfriend.
But as a wife, lndian girls is better.

110
00:22:03,892 --> 00:22:04,859
What are you trying to say?

111
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:09,191
Our girls will open the door for
their drunken husband.

112
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:13,199
But we as husband have to open the
door for drunken wife, its foreign girls.

113
00:22:13,335 --> 00:22:15,064
That is why l'm searching

114
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,968
None responded for my calls.

00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:05,748
You have all the capabilities
to become a politician.

127
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:27,440
Everyone is talking
about Tamil Passanga.

128
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:30,302
You did one step,

We have been selected for
the dance competition.

134
00:24:10,252 --> 00:24:11,685
Why are they driving like this?

135
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,166
l've convince everyone to
take you in for this competition.

136
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:05,295
You got in because
of your talent.

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,205
There is only 1 month
period for the event.

138
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:08,309
Practice well.

139
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,977

143
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:48,299
Why are you following
my daughter?!

144
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:49,000
He's not the one!

145
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:02,957
l'm the one who called them
to supply water for our restaurant.

146
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:09,824
She's my daughter Meera.

147
00:27:12,701 --> 00:27:14,726
She lost her mother.
l pampered her from small.

148
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:18,431
That is why l got tensed when
she said someone disturbed her.

149
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:22,376
So is it ok if she was disturbed
while her mother still around?

00:27:24,312 --> 00:27:26,405
He's our cook.
Have it.

He's a good cook.
We found him in Australia itself.

Only now we're testing
his cooking.

153
00:27:30,352 --> 00:27:31,250
Try it.

154
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:40,291
Once l started to cook,
everyone's mouth will be watery.

155
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:42,157

So can spit on you?

And you need love in this age?!

00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:21,017
We were waiting many days for an
lndian girl come here so can marry her.

We shouldn't chase these girls.

197

Why are you alone?
Where is your troop?

292

They're not my troop.
l was at the place where they were.

293
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:41,677
Why must they follow me?

294

Dad not around?
- He went out.

313
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:13,032

00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:16,167

321
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:12,260

Right?

323
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,099

Who is he?! He looks like
Poorstar, brother of Powerstar.

325
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:39,685
They're like a sleeper cells.
We couldn't know where they are.

326
00:42:39,827 --> 00:42:41,886
They suddenly pop up some
where and destroy our life.

327
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:44,090

Then why did torture us

Look at him, shaking his hand
like spinning a key chain.

332
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:03,977
Shaking plants, like a wet bird
and manage to get Meera.

333
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:08,079
Your dance should go to drain!

334
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:14,359
This is the payment for last stock.
l need 300 bottles this time.

335
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:15,325
Check the amount.

336

00:43:35,983 --> 00:43:37,416
But one let down.

340
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,449
ln the cook matter l failed.
- lt's not only the cook.

341
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:47,751
What else?
-You're living in a quality life..

342
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:51,126
But why did you get a lousy
groom for your daughter...

343
00:43:51,231 --> 00:43:52,220
Groom for my daughter?!

344
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:55,895
My daughter haven't get married yet.

345
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:00,431
l was thinking to seek
groom this year.

346
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:07,037
Where is everyone?

347
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:10,206
Everyone is busy at factory.

348
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:12,080
We have rehearsal right?
-Yes.

349
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:20,859
How could both of you doing
while he's there and you're here?

350
00:44:22,262 --> 00:44:25,425
What to do?
l'm asking him to come here.

351
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:29,328
He's tight with
shooting schedule.

352
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:31,028
Won't he even calls you?

353
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:34,363
He will call once a
while when he is free.

354
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:37,811
But if he calls,
he won't hang.

355
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:43,014
He keep on telling..

356
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:45,449
l even call him this morning.
But he didn't answer.

357
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:47,016
He must be busy.

358
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:48,349
That is why l'm upset.

359
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:09,172
l'm Sam here.
-Which Sam?

360
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:11,841
Your husband.

361
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,683
Why did you hang?
Talk to him.

362
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,719
l won't talk.
l'm upset right!

363
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:25,256
Why must l talk to him?!
- He's calling from lndia..

364
00:45:30,464 --> 00:45:32,022
What is wrong between
husband and wife?!

365
00:45:32,132 --> 00:45:32,996
Talk to him!

366
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:36,101
Why did you hang?
l love you.

367
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:41,134
He's talking exactly as you said.
Talk to him.

368
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:43,209
Talk to me.
l call you to hear your voice right.

369
00:45:43,343 --> 00:45:45,277
Dear, l'm busy now.
l will call you later.

370
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,346
She's not busy..
Talk.

371
00:45:47,448 --> 00:45:48,472
What is the matter?

372
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:51,912
l couldn't be without seeing you.
So l'm here.

373
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:54,111
He is here?!
Ask him where is he?

374
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,252
Where are you?

375
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:02,825
Which part?
-That a surprise.

376
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:03,793
Look behind.

377
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:51,776
You told me he did this song for
you, why are you running away?!

378
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,007
Catch him.
- Don't run.

379
00:46:57,951 --> 00:46:59,418
He have traveled so
far to see you.

380
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:07,850
What l'm doing between
husband and wife's problem.

381
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,731
l'm not married.
l doesn't know him.

382
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:17,895
Catch him.

383
00:47:44,097 --> 00:47:47,328
For coming to Australia for us. - l manage
to come coz l have shooting in Australia.

384
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:48,957
lf l was shooting in lndia
l might have not come.

385
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,821
He's trying for a land
that is booked.

386
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:07,246
A girl in your team?

387
00:49:30,837 --> 00:49:34,204
Try to understand, it is wrong to
make lSD call from friend's lphone.

388
00:51:10,971 --> 00:51:15,340
Don't do it. lt is wrong to do
prayers for someone's vehicle.

389
00:51:20,881 --> 00:51:22,473
You might don't
believe in love.

390
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:27,011
But about your future wife...

391
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:35,387
For me everything is my dad.
l never seen my mom as l remembered.

392
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,260
l never got a chance
to feel her love.

393
00:51:39,332 --> 00:51:47,740
My future wife should be more than a wife,
l would like her to be a mother for me.

394
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:04,040
lt is wrong to do pickles using
mangoes that belongs to someone else.

395
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:32,709
Why are we here?

396
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:35,111
Today we rehearse
in auditorium.

397
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,386
Shall we go?
-You go ahead, l have things to do.

398
00:54:33,206 --> 00:54:35,436
l thought you're a
decent person.

399
00:54:36,743 --> 00:54:37,675
What happened?

400
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:41,144
How the girls fall for you
and your responds to them.

401
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:45,246
That is the problem.

402
00:54:45,785 --> 00:54:49,846
What is it on me?
You can talk to anyone...

403
00:55:26,393 --> 00:55:29,362
lt's a small injury.
lt will be fine in 2 days.

404
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:36,229
When can she discharge...

405
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:38,195
ln 2 days.

406
00:55:54,721 --> 00:56:00,023
l can't change finalist dancers.
lf you want to take part, she must dance.

407
00:56:03,797 --> 00:56:05,230
Let it go.
We'll see next time.

408
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,374
Don't!They're one kind.

409
00:57:21,374 --> 00:57:23,740
Nothing can be solved
with fighting.

410
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:29,409
Your victory is not by beating them.
lts winning in the competition that counts.

411
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:36,814
She's bored in the room.
That is why...

412
00:57:38,725 --> 00:57:43,355
Shall we go?
- She's not discharged yet.Where?

413
01:01:54,046 --> 01:01:56,139
Can l be the mother
of your life?

414
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:19,437
Meera told me everything.

415
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,443
Shall we meet your parents?

416
01:02:26,979 --> 01:02:31,780
Dad doing business at Mumbai.
He only comes once a year to see me.

417
01:02:31,884 --> 01:02:34,717
l need to talk to him about this.
Can you ask him to come?

418
01:02:38,324 --> 01:02:43,421
lt isn't fair saying he's busy, asking you
to get married and later he will visit you.

419
01:02:43,563 --> 01:02:45,224
A son's life is important right.

420
01:02:45,331 --> 01:02:51,827
Not that, it must be very important.
-Why if he's busy, we go to him.

421
01:02:52,505 --> 01:02:56,805
l have asked him many times,
he doesn't like me to go back there.

422
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:59,776
Why must we tell him,
we give him a surprise.

423
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:02,010
Will he be upset?

424
01:03:05,384 --> 01:03:06,442
l will be back in 1 0 days.

425
01:03:07,186 --> 01:03:08,153
Why are you in dull?

426
01:03:08,354 --> 01:03:12,415
lf you told me earlier that you love her,
sure l will let her go for you.

427
01:03:12,725 --> 01:03:16,092
But you lied to me saying
she's married.

428
01:03:19,732 --> 01:03:23,896
l suppose to marry her,
but now sending her off.

429
01:03:24,003 --> 01:03:25,027
l respect our friendship.

430
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,903
lt's time to go.
Shall we go.

431
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,914
What is the hse address
at Mumbai?

432
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,790
lt's a famous place at Mumbai.

433
01:03:50,296 --> 01:03:51,422
ls famous,

434
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,459
Beside there.

435
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,505
Uncle, Viswa here.
Where is our hse at Mumbai?

436
01:04:04,777 --> 01:04:07,974
Why?
- l'll be in lndia tomorrow morning.

437
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,139
What are you talking?
- Don't tell dad.

438
01:04:10,283 --> 01:04:11,307
Pls send car to pick me.

439
01:04:12,852 --> 01:04:13,978
Situation now is not right...

440
01:04:18,057 --> 01:04:19,183
l will call you.

441
01:04:39,211 --> 01:04:41,008
Shall we go.
- And you are?

442
01:04:41,147 --> 01:04:43,012
Uncle send me.
Come.

443
01:04:44,717 --> 01:04:49,245
l thought my dad is busy,
but my uncle is busy too.

444
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:53,918
But at least he have sent
a aircond vehicle.

445
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,190
House?
-They asked me to bring you here.

446
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:40,933
Come Viswa.
- Police didn't sees you?

447
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,237
No.
- Get the gun from the driver.

448
01:05:49,181 --> 01:05:51,775
What is happening here?
Who are they?

449
01:05:51,917 --> 01:05:53,407
Sure you have thousands questions.

450
01:05:54,253 --> 01:05:56,915
Dad will answer you.
-Where is he?

451
01:05:57,023 --> 01:05:59,355
lt is not that easy to see
him in this situation.

452
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:03,224
No one knows where he is.
Sure he knows that you're here.

453
01:06:03,362 --> 01:06:05,023
He will call you.

454
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:08,894
What is this all about? You told me
your father is a big businessman.

455
01:06:09,101 --> 01:06:11,399
Who is your father?
What is he doing?!

456
01:06:12,238 --> 01:06:14,763
He told me he is
running business.

457
01:06:15,307 --> 01:06:17,070
What a Tamilian running
a business here?

458
01:06:17,743 --> 01:06:20,109
ls a businessman will
hide from policeman?

459
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:23,243
Your father doing
wrong work.

460
01:06:25,117 --> 01:06:27,745
Dad. - Look here Meera,
it's not wrong to love.

461
01:06:27,887 --> 01:06:31,084
lt is important to know the
background of your partner.

462
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:34,717
l doesn't know anything.
l only know after coming here...

463
01:06:35,494 --> 01:06:36,961
Dad asked to bring you in.

464
01:06:37,263 --> 01:06:39,060
Come.
-You alone.

465
01:06:45,237 --> 01:06:46,329
Go in.

466
01:06:48,374 --> 01:06:49,705
Tea.
- No.

467
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:50,867
Please sit.

468
01:06:59,385 --> 01:07:00,750
Shall we go.

469
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,429
Let's go.

470
01:07:57,943 --> 01:07:59,706
Dad?
- He's upstairs. Go ahead.

471
01:08:48,794 --> 01:08:53,060
l was thinking that
all this is a mistake.

472
01:08:55,034 --> 01:08:59,027
But l have saw you.
l saw your true color.

473
01:08:59,972 --> 01:09:03,567
You avoid me from
here because of this..

474
01:09:07,413 --> 01:09:08,539
Who are you?

475
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,175
What wrong you're doing?

476
01:09:12,985 --> 01:09:17,547
For whom you're living by
scarifying me and my mother?

477
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:20,451
Answer me, dad.

478
01:09:53,726 --> 01:09:54,886
For them.

479
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:19,714
l wanted to be a good leader
and a father.

480
01:10:21,754 --> 01:10:22,914
My decision...

481
01:10:23,789 --> 01:10:26,019
Not to spoil your future..

482
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:30,220
l stayed away from
you all these years...

483
01:10:30,996 --> 01:10:32,827
Then why do you
need to hide?

484
01:10:36,135 --> 01:10:37,898
l'm not a Gandhi
nor Buddha.

485
01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:45,702
All this while,
l do whatever l feel is right.

486
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:50,815
l never think is it right
or wrong.

487
01:10:53,252 --> 01:10:55,083
And one thing that
l did is...

488
01:10:58,223 --> 01:10:59,986
Have grew bigger and
stabbing me.

489
01:11:57,316 --> 01:11:59,250
You are?
-Your friend.

490
01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:02,148
Enemy of your enemy
is your friend.

491
01:12:02,654 --> 01:12:03,814
Anna!

492
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,181
Go and get Anna!

493
01:12:40,426 --> 01:12:43,520
Selling drugs in the hospital!
- Do you know whose hospital is this?!

494
01:12:44,196 --> 01:12:45,754
Where is Anna?!

495
01:13:14,593 --> 01:13:16,652
Where are you hiding Anna?!
Tell!

496
01:13:24,903 --> 01:13:27,337
People are protesting
not to arrest Anna.

497
01:14:03,909 --> 01:14:05,968
l never scared for death.

498
01:14:07,746 --> 01:14:09,680
l should died with your mother.

499
01:14:11,016 --> 01:14:13,211
But he's not just want
to destroy me alone.

500
01:14:14,853 --> 01:14:19,222
This place...
Life of these ppl.

501
01:14:19,358 --> 01:14:22,384
That is why l'm hiding
from police.

502
01:14:24,163 --> 01:14:27,155
Don't.
Follow me back.

503
01:14:29,301 --> 01:14:30,632
Where do you
want me to go?

504
01:14:31,303 --> 01:14:32,565
This is an
one way road.

505
01:14:33,372 --> 01:14:34,805
Only life will go
away from here.

506
01:14:36,942 --> 01:14:39,001
Once we took the cleaver,

507
01:14:40,312 --> 01:14:43,440
lt will either to guard us,
or to destroy us.

508
01:14:44,249 --> 01:14:45,273
We can't let it go.

509
01:14:46,718 --> 01:14:47,548
Today..

510
01:14:50,055 --> 01:14:54,321
the things you saw...
Forget all.

511
01:14:58,597 --> 01:14:59,791
Go back.

512
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:03,391
l was believing that
you're happy here..

513
01:15:04,136 --> 01:15:05,831
That is why l was
living there..

514
01:15:08,373 --> 01:15:11,809
l'm not going back.

515
01:15:12,077 --> 01:15:14,011
You don't need life like this.

516
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,742
Let it go with me.

517
01:15:18,183 --> 01:15:22,449
You need to go..
Get married with the girl you love..

518
01:15:25,224 --> 01:15:26,555
Live happily.

519
01:15:31,897 --> 01:15:33,888
My wish as a father.

520
01:15:40,939 --> 01:15:43,840
The father and his daughter
got scared seeing us.

521
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:46,605
They are leaving tonight.

522
01:15:48,113 --> 01:15:50,445
They never listen to us.
And they went to stay at a hotel.

523
01:15:50,782 --> 01:15:52,215
Which hotel?
- Don't.

524
01:15:53,252 --> 01:15:55,777
Situation is not good outside.
And the police department...

525
01:15:56,588 --> 01:15:58,453
lt will be troublesome
if all of you follow.

526
01:15:59,024 --> 01:16:00,582
l'll go alone.

527
01:16:02,561 --> 01:16:04,119
lt's my son's life.

528
01:16:26,118 --> 01:16:28,279
Dad, she's Meera.

529
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,896
l'm not here as Anna.
l came as his Viswa's father.

530
01:16:39,298 --> 01:16:40,856
lt's getting late,
you go in.

531
01:16:41,533 --> 01:16:43,626
Taxi will be here soon.
Pack up soon.

532
01:16:50,075 --> 01:16:53,636
You go back...
Bring back my son too.

533
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:01,612
You saw my life.
He is not involve in it.

534
01:17:09,094 --> 01:17:11,028
For my sake,
His life...

535
01:17:14,633 --> 01:17:22,438
Dad, you don't need
to do this for me...

536
01:17:22,574 --> 01:17:25,441
No, this must happen.

537
01:17:33,185 --> 01:17:35,585
For my mistakes,
don't spoil my son's..

538
01:21:02,327 --> 01:21:05,956
Sun news. Because of the death
of Anna while under police custody.

539
01:21:06,097 --> 01:21:08,657
There is a clash between
police and public.

540
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,597
The clash grew big.

541
01:21:10,735 --> 01:21:16,833
On this Delhi have ordered Emergency,
by this ppl's life effected.

542
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,958
lt's a say that police did the murder
of Anna.What is your answer?

543
01:21:48,073 --> 01:21:49,301
What do you want me to do?

544
01:21:49,441 --> 01:21:52,433
Who murdered Anna?
Who are the ppl involved?

545
01:21:52,577 --> 01:21:54,772
Give me order to investigate
on this case.

546
01:21:57,148 --> 01:21:59,378
You are young.
With a young blood.

547
01:21:59,985 --> 01:22:02,545
This is a system.
We're not alone in this system.

548
01:22:02,687 --> 01:22:05,315
Politicians in it,
and so criminals.

549
01:22:05,457 --> 01:22:07,482
Police and the system is here
to keep law and order.

550
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:08,752
lf we ourselves do wrong?!

551
01:22:10,161 --> 01:22:11,628
Then what the need
law and order?

552
01:22:11,863 --> 01:22:15,492
Even l was like you when
l became a policeman.

553
01:22:15,634 --> 01:22:19,297
Will question everything,
and fight for law.

554
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,072
Nothing changes here.

555
01:22:22,707 --> 01:22:24,902
The one that changed is me.

556
01:22:25,043 --> 01:22:26,601
l can't change myself such, sir.

557
01:22:26,845 --> 01:22:32,112
lf l felt l'm changing as you say,
l will quit.

558
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:43,287
lt's my 25 years of determination.

559
01:22:43,428 --> 01:22:45,919
You have fulfill my father's dream.

560
01:22:46,064 --> 01:22:51,127
Ppl like Anna will now realize what will
happen when they oppose a politician.

561
01:22:51,903 --> 01:22:54,997
You're in charge in everything
here after this.

562
01:23:09,721 --> 01:23:12,155
He have the whole
place in his control.

563
01:23:12,757 --> 01:23:15,851
We can't live opposing Bheema.

564
01:23:16,094 --> 01:23:18,460
We were in safe hand
when Anna was around.

565
01:23:18,596 --> 01:23:20,063
But now we have no one...

566
01:23:20,732 --> 01:23:21,664
l'm here.

567
01:23:28,573 --> 01:23:32,373
You are new here.You're talking
without knowing Bheema's capabilities.

568
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:35,340
He killed Anna.
We're nothing.

569
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,176
How can we oppose knowing you are
backing us up... -What are you talking?!

570
01:23:38,516 --> 01:23:39,744
He's saying that he
will back us up right?!

571
01:23:39,984 --> 01:23:41,246
Keep on talking nonsense.

572
01:23:41,486 --> 01:23:44,284
lf we scared today,
it will prolong for life.

573
01:23:44,923 --> 01:23:48,222
Bro, l'm believing in you.
Let the non believer leave.

574
01:23:49,327 --> 01:23:50,817
Don't you come
inside this life.

575
01:23:51,329 --> 01:23:52,660
This world totally different.

576
01:23:53,698 --> 01:23:55,222
What should happen,
it happened.

577
01:23:55,934 --> 01:23:57,629
None can change that.

578
01:23:58,703 --> 01:24:06,269
Don't confused yourself...
- Must bring ppl who involved to justice.

579
01:24:06,411 --> 01:24:08,436
Even the justice is
in their control, right.

580
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,013
That is how they killed Anna...

581
01:24:11,816 --> 01:24:14,148
We know how to get revenge
on Anna's death.

582
01:24:14,986 --> 01:24:16,214
Ticket.

583
01:24:18,356 --> 01:24:19,789
This is the ticket for
you to go back.

584
01:24:22,026 --> 01:24:23,288
Please leave this place.

585
01:24:23,728 --> 01:24:25,195
We don't want to lose you too.

586
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:28,358
This wasn't my decision,
its Anna's decision.

587
01:24:42,413 --> 01:24:44,677
ls there any other
way to go airport?

588
01:24:45,016 --> 01:24:46,415
No, it will turn to green soon.
We'll move.

589
01:25:01,633 --> 01:25:03,601
Listen to me!
Don't go!

590
01:25:28,993 --> 01:25:31,791
Your death will be
a lesson for others.

591
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:35,457
lf anyone try to oppose
Bheema in this Mumbai...

592
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:46,943
Viswa, listen to me.
Let's go from here.

593
01:27:10,695 --> 01:27:12,424
They have cut in 8 parts.
lt is critical.

594
01:27:17,535 --> 01:27:19,662
lt is not enough saying
we will back up.

595
01:27:20,438 --> 01:27:24,568
Look now, because of your word,
the whole family will destroy.

596
01:27:25,276 --> 01:27:27,710
Don't we know, answer me!
What should be done?!

597
01:27:29,514 --> 01:27:31,880
We're keeping quiet
not because we scared.

598
01:27:34,185 --> 01:27:35,243
Waiting..

599
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,683
Waiting for our time.

600
01:27:41,092 --> 01:27:43,424
l thought if you stay here,
you'll be in trouble.

601
01:27:43,561 --> 01:27:45,495
Now the others get into
problem because of you.

602
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:48,360
lt must said others
lived because of us.

603
01:27:49,233 --> 01:27:50,825
Shouldn't die because of us.

604
01:27:51,703 --> 01:27:52,567
Go back.

605
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,445
lt seems he won't go back.

606
01:28:05,984 --> 01:28:11,320
We thought he's a kid.
- Not just a kid, Anna's kid.

607
01:28:11,456 --> 01:28:14,550
So will we get trouble in
tomorrow function?

608
01:28:14,692 --> 01:28:16,091
lt won't.

609
01:28:17,228 --> 01:28:18,490
lf he still alive right.

610
01:31:11,369 --> 01:31:12,529
Listen!

611
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:16,936
This is the last warning!
All of you in 5 minutes must...

612
01:31:17,074 --> 01:31:21,340
Must pack up everything
and leave from here!

613
01:31:21,479 --> 01:31:22,411
Understood?!

614
01:33:20,931 --> 01:33:23,593
This is a murder case.
We can't give bail.

615
01:33:23,734 --> 01:33:25,133
We need to see him.

616
01:33:27,071 --> 01:33:29,938
You can't see him.
What will you do? Get out.

617
01:33:59,503 --> 01:34:03,064
lf anything happen to
Viswa as happened to Anna...

618
01:34:04,275 --> 01:34:06,004
Let's go.
We see him in court.

619
01:34:08,212 --> 01:34:09,543
What case?
lt's a murder case.

620
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:13,116
He killed Bheema's men.
The accused is Anna's son.

621
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:15,241
lt seems Anna raised
him oversea.

622
01:34:15,386 --> 01:34:16,250
Where is he?
Centraljail?

623
01:34:16,387 --> 01:34:17,945
Mahim station.
ln police custody.

624
01:34:18,089 --> 01:34:19,647
Then it's hard to get bail.
-Yes.

625
01:34:29,633 --> 01:34:35,094
Small kid.You're doing things
not knowing who we are.

626
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,673
l thought of letting you go..

627
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:43,103
l seen you.

628
01:34:44,081 --> 01:34:51,613
l was searching for you.
And l saw you.

629
01:34:52,423 --> 01:34:53,412
So?

630
01:34:55,926 --> 01:34:58,417
l shouldn't kill someone
else thinking you, right.

631
01:35:02,733 --> 01:35:04,667
You will kill me?

632
01:35:12,743 --> 01:35:15,303
l will kill you as
you kill my dad!

633
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,810
You need to be
alive for that, right.

634
01:35:20,384 --> 01:35:22,443
What are you doing?!
This is police station.

635
01:35:22,586 --> 01:35:23,712
l will get into problem.
Don't.

636
01:35:25,456 --> 01:35:28,425
l will let him alive.
You take his life outside.

637
01:35:33,497 --> 01:35:39,834
Before that, see whether you
can get to see the sun rise or not.

638
01:36:11,402 --> 01:36:14,030
Our duty is to present the accused
to court once arrested.

639
01:36:14,171 --> 01:36:15,331
Not to tie and
beat them up.

640
01:36:15,473 --> 01:36:16,531
Button up!

641
01:36:19,376 --> 01:36:21,936
Don't involve unnecessary.

642
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:24,377
This is politics.

643
01:36:24,515 --> 01:36:27,507
l'm not a politician,
and not working for them.

644
01:36:39,263 --> 01:36:40,230
Water.

645
01:36:51,976 --> 01:36:53,238
Sir, Ranji here.

646
01:37:01,285 --> 01:37:05,619
lt is the station responsibility whoever
they arrested to produce to the court.

647
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:07,880
Leave that place now.

648
01:37:23,507 --> 01:37:25,134
Go back home.
- Sir, l'm doing night shift.

649
01:37:25,376 --> 01:37:26,809
l will take care.
You leave.

650
01:37:26,944 --> 01:37:28,045
Come here.

651
01:37:28,045 --> 01:37:29,012
Go and buy chicken
bryani and mutton kurma.

652
01:37:29,914 --> 01:37:31,381
Just come after 2 hours.

653
01:37:52,303 --> 01:37:54,464
How long need to
wait for you?!

654
01:37:58,909 --> 01:37:59,807
Viswa, it's us.

655
01:38:08,252 --> 01:38:10,311
Faster.
Bring him silently.

656
01:38:11,889 --> 01:38:14,221
Don't just go.
Beat me.

657
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:16,319
Hit me!

658
01:38:22,366 --> 01:38:23,424
You.

659
01:38:31,875 --> 01:38:34,469
Enough.
Leave!

660
01:38:48,726 --> 01:38:50,455
Where is Viswa?
-Viswa?!

661
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:53,390
Your men who
came and took him.

662
01:38:56,133 --> 01:38:58,328
He was in your custody right?!
Need to produce him to the court.

663
01:38:58,469 --> 01:39:01,267
Who is going to take responsibility?
- l will bring him in.

664
01:39:01,405 --> 01:39:04,101
Or give me order to
encounter him, l will..

665
01:39:29,967 --> 01:39:32,060
Police should protect civilians,

666
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:37,571
because of officer like
him civilians protecting us.

667
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:30,326
None came to witness your
murder not because of fear...

668
01:40:30,828 --> 01:40:32,193
Because of respect.

669
01:40:33,931 --> 01:40:36,695
The word 'leader' is
not a word we go for.

670
01:40:37,201 --> 01:40:38,896
lt should come to us.

671
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:44,104
They are calling you.
Calling you as their leader.

672
01:43:16,627 --> 01:43:18,959
This money isn't for you.
lt's for us.

673
01:43:19,396 --> 01:43:22,297
For our safety.
Pls take it.

674
01:43:22,532 --> 01:43:24,727
All of you are employees
at Anna's trust.

675
01:43:24,868 --> 01:43:27,632
You will receive salary monthly.
And this is the atm card.

676
01:44:55,158 --> 01:44:56,147
He is Kumar.

677
01:44:57,461 --> 01:44:58,985
He having a video shop.

678
01:44:59,663 --> 01:45:01,756
At his opposite shop
there is a internet cafe.

679
01:45:05,802 --> 01:45:10,535
What is the problem?
-They are doing bad things in the cafe.

680
01:45:24,254 --> 01:45:27,951
This is your wife's video.
Try to complaint this.

681
01:45:45,675 --> 01:45:50,271
We only have reasons to kill them,
but you have the rights.

682
01:46:48,939 --> 01:46:52,397
We are not the wrong doers.
We are the one who against them.

683
01:46:58,148 --> 01:46:59,479
What are you doing here?

684
01:47:00,117 --> 01:47:03,917
Everyone have work to do right.
l'm the one useless here.

685
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:12,254
That van doesn't have clutch,
you can drive it.

686
01:47:13,597 --> 01:47:16,532
Now onwards you're like god
Krishna for everyone of us.

687
01:47:48,798 --> 01:47:49,662
This is the hse.

688

Welcome.

691
01:48:00,544 --> 01:48:01,602
Yes.

692
01:48:01,745 --> 01:48:04,805
He is our brother Ratna's son.
- Saw him when he was small.

693
01:48:04,948 --> 01:48:06,415
How are you?
-Yes.

694
01:48:06,950 --> 01:48:09,111
Your father was
everything for us.

695
01:48:09,819 --> 01:48:12,515
He gave us Anna and left us.

696
01:48:12,656 --> 01:48:16,888
ls it only Anna he gave,
or he gave money to pass it to me?

697
01:48:19,663 --> 01:48:20,493
Answer me.

698
01:48:21,731 --> 01:48:24,097
Where is Viswa?
- He's in meeting.

699
01:48:24,234 --> 01:48:24,996
He's in meeting?!

700
01:48:31,608 --> 01:48:35,135
You told me he's in a meeting?
But he is talking to that kind of ppl.

701
01:48:35,245 --> 01:48:38,737
They not ordinary ppl.
They are rowdies and gangsters.

702
01:48:40,116 --> 01:48:47,750
What is the meeting about?
- Don't do all these, repent.

703
01:48:47,891 --> 01:48:49,085
We will give money
monthly for you.

704
01:49:05,542 --> 01:49:06,770
What is all this?

705
01:49:07,711 --> 01:49:11,078
You look totally different.
l know you can't come after dad's lost.

706
01:49:11,214 --> 01:49:13,114
l didn't aspect you will
stay permanently here.

707
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:16,117
We don't need all this.
Let's go back.

708
01:49:16,853 --> 01:49:19,947
Where do you want me to go?
This is one way road.

709
01:49:21,191 --> 01:49:22,783
Only life goes from here.

710
01:49:23,693 --> 01:49:25,786
Once we took the cleaver,

711
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:29,562
lt will either to guard us,
or to destroy us.

712
01:49:30,867 --> 01:49:32,528
But we can't let it go.

713
01:49:36,506 --> 01:49:39,066
Come Bheema,
tell me.

714
01:49:39,442 --> 01:49:44,539
lt won't take long time to do
as l did to make you a minister.

715
01:49:44,681 --> 01:49:50,085
What happened? -Viswa getting
stronger, and you didn't do anything!

716
01:49:50,220 --> 01:49:55,453
What do you want me to do?
A big group of ppl backing him up.

717
01:49:55,592 --> 01:49:58,425
lf we let him,
he'll be the next Anna.

718
01:49:59,095 --> 01:50:04,089
We can't destroy him with anger.
But with smartness.

719
01:50:04,501 --> 01:50:05,934
With political smartness.

720
01:50:45,442 --> 01:50:46,966
Why did you ask
me to come here?

721
01:50:49,412 --> 01:50:55,510
Look there.They are protesting to
chase out non Maharishians from Mumbai.

722
01:50:55,652 --> 01:50:57,847
So what?
What are trying to say now?

723
01:50:58,188 --> 01:51:01,419
This is Mathunga area.
Maharisian population very less here.

724
01:51:01,558 --> 01:51:05,119
Bihari and Tamilian
are more in this area.

725
01:51:05,261 --> 01:51:08,753
Today there will be a big clash
between Maharisian and rest.

726
01:51:08,898 --> 01:51:10,763
And for sure Viswa will
come to settle the clash.

727
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:12,060
At that time we will kill him.

728
01:51:12,202 --> 01:51:15,330
How will he be here?
- Sure he will come.

729
01:51:16,139 --> 01:51:17,367
For the sake of these ppl.

730
01:51:18,007 --> 01:51:20,339
What should l do here?
- Don't do anything.

731
01:51:20,477 --> 01:51:24,436
You just avoid police to
interfere till we kill Viswa.

732
01:51:24,681 --> 01:51:25,739
Ok, what is your plan?

733
01:51:25,882 --> 01:51:29,716
All of them our men.
After you leave from here.

734
01:51:29,853 --> 01:51:35,018
They will split to 2 groups,
one group willjoin as the protester.

735
01:51:35,158 --> 01:51:39,356
Another group will
be with civilians.

736
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:47,493
Once they at positions, the ones with the
civilian will throw stones at the protester.

737
01:51:49,005 --> 01:51:53,169
Once someone get injured,
protester will run off.

738
01:51:54,244 --> 01:52:01,275
But our men inside protester's group
will throw petrol bomb to civilians.

739
01:52:01,851 --> 01:52:03,785
And the rest will join them.

740
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:08,389
And a big clash will start.

741
01:52:21,204 --> 01:52:23,138
He recorded everything,
catch him.

742
01:53:27,203 --> 01:53:29,228
l'm videographer Kumar here.
-Yes, Kumar.

743
01:53:29,372 --> 01:53:30,839
ln Mathunga area...

744
01:53:52,262 --> 01:53:53,388
Viswa
- Uncle.

745
01:53:53,530 --> 01:53:56,795
A big clash going on at Mathunga,
go and check it up.

746
01:53:58,067 --> 01:53:59,227
Turn the van.
-Yes.

747
01:56:14,570 --> 01:56:17,232
A big clash happened, and none
of the policemen came to the scene!

748
01:56:17,373 --> 01:56:19,136
We did call them.
-Then why weren't they came?!

749
01:56:22,011 --> 01:56:25,879
What is the problem there?
-They asking non Maharisian to send off.

750
01:56:26,015 --> 01:56:27,812
lf not they warned that they
will burn down this hospital.

751
01:56:43,566 --> 01:56:45,056
Don't you involve in this.

752
01:56:57,680 --> 01:56:59,841
We save and brought them
from the incident.

753
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:05,353
l don't know who is Bihari,
Tamil, nor Maharisian among them.

754
01:57:06,189 --> 01:57:07,918
lf you can figure it out.
Go ahead.

755
01:57:08,458 --> 01:57:09,482
Get them and kill them.

756
01:57:10,293 --> 01:57:11,123
Come here!

757
01:57:11,761 --> 01:57:14,491
Look at him. Can you figure
it out by seeing at his blood?

758
01:57:14,731 --> 01:57:16,164
Whether is he Maharisian or else?!

759
01:57:16,632 --> 01:57:17,599
lf can, kill him!

760
01:57:20,369 --> 01:57:22,496
Can you see anything from
that innocent girl?

761
01:57:23,272 --> 01:57:24,204
lf you can see,
kill her!

762
01:57:25,341 --> 01:57:26,933
Do you know anyone
among them?

763
01:57:27,176 --> 01:57:28,302
Are any of them is your enemy?

764
01:57:29,879 --> 01:57:33,975
No, right?!Then why must
these innocent ppl die?!

765
01:57:35,718 --> 01:57:36,707
For the sake of who?!

766
01:57:37,754 --> 01:57:40,882
They created cast, language
and rest to live.

767
01:57:45,294 --> 01:57:48,388
You beat and chasing off because
they areTamilian, Bihar and rest...

768
01:57:48,531 --> 01:57:51,694
Tomorrow in their land, they will
do the same to your brothers.

769
01:57:51,934 --> 01:57:53,128
lt will prolong forever.

770
01:57:54,103 --> 01:57:56,094
You and him not
from other country!

771
01:57:56,239 --> 01:57:57,536
All belongs to the
same country, lndia!

772
01:57:58,107 --> 01:58:00,701
Everyone have rights
to stay anywhere.

773
01:58:01,043 --> 01:58:04,979
lf you still feel to kill them,
go and kill them!

774
01:58:28,471 --> 01:58:32,464
Get up, slowly.
- Don't.

775
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:35,836
Give us some poison.

776
01:58:36,345 --> 01:58:38,006
We'll die drinking it.

777
01:58:38,815 --> 01:58:42,046
They will send all of us
out from here.

778
01:58:43,419 --> 01:58:48,550
Better we'll die rather than end up on
the street begging without home.

779
01:59:16,385 --> 01:59:20,788
Not everyone gets a family,
few like me doesn't have parents.

780
01:59:21,023 --> 01:59:23,583
Some of you doesn't
have brothers or sisters.

781
01:59:23,759 --> 01:59:28,458
That is why god send them to us.
We don't know what we have to give them.

782
01:59:31,067 --> 01:59:32,398
But we will give
what we have.

783
01:59:39,041 --> 01:59:41,168
Can l bring her back home?

784
01:59:56,692 --> 01:59:57,954
Come to my hse.

785
02:00:13,442 --> 02:00:14,773
You did better than Anna.

786
02:00:23,886 --> 02:00:30,917
Cause of the clash that happened
recently have been found.

787
02:00:31,160 --> 02:00:36,257
Dinakaran news reporter who went
to get news about the protester,

788
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:39,163
He have captured photo of
the ppl who started the clash.

789
02:00:39,302 --> 02:00:44,137
Mumbai police are searching who
are they and what is their motive.

790
02:00:44,273 --> 02:00:46,969
lf you stayed here too, who will take
care of your business in Australia?

791
02:00:47,109 --> 02:00:48,633
lt's not so important.

792
02:00:48,778 --> 02:00:51,372
l was living without
knowing my blood history.

793
02:00:52,648 --> 02:00:55,017
lt seems Anna will
scared of my father.

794
02:00:55,017 --> 02:01:02,287
And l was born to him,
l felt humiliated supplying water.

795
02:01:02,525 --> 02:01:03,685
So what are you
going to do here?

796
02:01:05,227 --> 02:01:06,854
Pity Viswa,
he lost his dad right?

797
02:01:06,996 --> 02:01:09,021
So l thought of being
godfather for him.

798
02:01:13,936 --> 02:01:15,096
Sister!

799
02:01:16,939 --> 02:01:17,928
Greetings, police sister!

800
02:01:18,074 --> 02:01:19,974

You came for a round?

801
02:01:21,577 --> 02:01:23,704
Sis, l doesn't know
who is Viswa.

802
02:01:23,846 --> 02:01:24,938
He just met in facebook.

803
02:01:25,181 --> 02:01:25,943
Sis...

804
02:01:26,515 --> 02:01:30,542
You look like disco Shanti
in this attire.

805
02:01:30,686 --> 02:01:32,677
No..
lts Vijayshanti.

806
02:01:32,822 --> 02:01:35,120
And without knowing this,
l tried to love you..

807
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:42,688
Did you see how l escaped?

808
02:01:44,967 --> 02:01:46,059
You should ran off from here.

809
02:01:50,406 --> 02:01:51,634
Where should l go?

810
02:01:51,774 --> 02:01:53,264
This is one way road.

811
02:01:53,409 --> 02:01:55,843
Only life goes from here.

812
02:02:05,821 --> 02:02:07,482
We don't need to
scared of anyone.

813
02:02:07,623 --> 02:02:09,318
Because we're in a temple.

814
02:02:10,793 --> 02:02:13,660
Our god will look
after us if anything.

815
02:02:14,663 --> 02:02:16,187
Why are the police here?

816
02:02:28,077 --> 02:02:31,137
Whoever it is,
law will punish the guilty.

817
02:02:41,257 --> 02:02:43,054
He is safe right?
-Yes.

818
02:02:43,192 --> 02:02:46,593
Tell him not to come
to Mumbai till l say so.

819
02:03:07,216 --> 02:03:09,650
What are you talking
about vegetables with her?

820
02:03:09,785 --> 02:03:11,377
They already cooked right.

821
02:03:11,620 --> 02:03:17,149
She wants to see Viswa.
-Why won't she tells us the matter?!

822
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:20,490
Tell me.
Whatever it is.

823
02:03:20,629 --> 02:03:21,891
l'm bigger than Viswa.

824
02:03:27,636 --> 02:03:30,196
She lost something,
Viswa should find it for her.

825
02:03:30,372 --> 02:03:36,743
They will lost things everywhere,
and she want only Viswa to find it?!

826
02:03:42,718 --> 02:03:44,413
She didn't lost it.
Someone stole it.

827
02:03:52,828 --> 02:03:54,897
Who is that?!

828
02:03:54,897 --> 02:03:56,330
All come here!

829
02:03:56,765 --> 02:03:57,993
Who stole it from her?!

830
02:03:59,435 --> 02:04:00,561
ls he?!

831
02:04:03,572 --> 02:04:04,334
Or him?!

832
02:04:08,644 --> 02:04:10,839
Why are you standing in group
wearing old clothes?!

833
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:12,544
Go back!

834
02:04:17,987 --> 02:04:19,818
All of you doesn't
know me well.

835
02:04:19,955 --> 02:04:25,518
l'm greater than Viswa.

836
02:04:25,661 --> 02:04:28,152
You're saying someone stole
from her.What did she lost?

837
02:04:28,297 --> 02:04:29,423

Who took her 'dil' (heart)?

839
02:04:43,746 --> 02:04:45,077
Who stole her 'dil' (heart)?!

840
02:04:45,548 --> 02:04:47,379
Logu, 'dil' means heart!

841
02:04:47,917 --> 02:04:50,750
Someone stole her heart.
And you have...

842
02:05:01,864 --> 02:05:03,263
Who stole your heart?

843
02:05:10,739 --> 02:05:13,936
Your Viswa is the one stole her
heart. Do you courage to ask him?

844
02:05:14,076 --> 02:05:14,940
l don't have courage,
but have alcohol.

845
02:05:15,077 --> 02:05:16,806
Shall we go and ask him
together after drank it?!

846
02:05:16,946 --> 02:05:19,039
Get lost!

847
02:05:22,318 --> 02:05:25,515
We will take care of that tape.
Don't hide him.

848
02:05:26,188 --> 02:05:27,246
Finish him off.

849
02:05:27,523 --> 02:05:30,390
We'll be in mess if he
get caught by police.

850
02:05:30,526 --> 02:05:34,121
ln politics not everything
that happens side us.

851
02:05:34,363 --> 02:05:37,628
We must take advantage for
every things that happens.

852
02:05:41,604 --> 02:05:45,207
lf a girl came to our place
saying she loves Viswa,

853
02:05:45,207 --> 02:05:49,007
l feel she must be ClD, CBl, or DSP.

854
02:05:49,144 --> 02:05:51,908
Why are you saying she's a police.
She doesn't look such.

855
02:05:52,748 --> 02:05:57,208
She won't look such, but she will
well planned and get us arrested.

856
02:05:57,353 --> 02:06:00,288
She shouldn't get near Viswa.
She shouldn't come into this hse.

857
02:06:00,422 --> 02:06:02,652
We must guarded well..
- Greetings.

858
02:06:02,791 --> 02:06:03,758
Greetings.

859
02:06:05,261 --> 02:06:06,888
She's greet us so
can lock us in!

860
02:06:27,683 --> 02:06:29,048
l have saved Viswa from her.

861
02:06:36,592 --> 02:06:38,924
He's in bar?!
Since when he started to drink?

862
02:06:39,061 --> 02:06:40,892
lt means outside.
- Outside?!

863
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:41,997
Open the door!

864
02:06:45,734 --> 02:06:47,964
Then who is bathing inside?
- My dad.

865
02:06:53,075 --> 02:06:54,542
lt's already late.
Come and eat.

866
02:07:03,719 --> 02:07:04,845
Aunty..

867
02:07:30,312 --> 02:07:33,042
lf we still be calm,
things will get worst.

868
02:07:33,515 --> 02:07:34,709
We must take action.

869
02:07:38,287 --> 02:07:39,151
What?

870
02:07:39,321 --> 02:07:41,789
Usually in this situation, someone will
open the door and make us the comedian.

871
02:07:42,825 --> 02:07:44,952
That is for comedian,
but l'm the hero.

872
02:07:45,094 --> 02:07:45,856
Move!

873
02:07:53,235 --> 02:07:55,465
Things happened
as he says.

874
02:07:56,605 --> 02:07:59,574
Sun news.
At Mumbai Mahim station,

875
02:07:59,708 --> 02:08:02,871
A photographer named Kumar
was murdered mysteriously.

876
02:08:03,011 --> 02:08:04,740
And made a big news among ppl.

877
02:08:18,827 --> 02:08:21,295
Kumar is the one took video
on her wedding day.

878
02:08:21,897 --> 02:08:23,489
How did he died...

879
02:08:26,034 --> 02:08:28,468
He called me before l
head to the clash site.

880
02:08:30,339 --> 02:08:33,934
As Gowri says,
Kumar was at the place.

881
02:08:34,076 --> 02:08:37,568
But how he ended up at Mahim?

882
02:08:39,848 --> 02:08:44,285
The person involved in the
clash have surrender to police.

883
02:08:45,654 --> 02:08:46,552
What is in that?

884
02:08:47,589 --> 02:08:51,320
He gave statement that Viswa
who ordered him to do it.

885
02:08:52,795 --> 02:08:56,060
Police will come any minute
to arrest Viswa.

886
02:09:27,863 --> 02:09:29,592
lt's not a problem is
we didn't get the tape.

887
02:09:30,532 --> 02:09:34,024
But for sure Viswa will get
all the information thru Arjun.

888
02:09:38,207 --> 02:09:41,472
We chased him thinking
the tape is with him.

889
02:09:46,782 --> 02:09:48,272
But it wasn't with him.

890
02:09:50,786 --> 02:09:56,247
l came here thinking he might pass
it to someone to send it here at his shop.

891
02:09:56,391 --> 02:09:58,086
He didn't pass it to anyone.

892
02:09:58,227 --> 02:10:01,253
lf he gave to someone sure the things
he recorded have published by now.

893
02:10:01,396 --> 02:10:02,693
The tape was with him
when he get in the train.

894
02:10:02,831 --> 02:10:04,162
lf when he doesn't
have when he get down..

895
02:10:04,299 --> 02:10:05,732
ln that train..

896
02:10:09,938 --> 02:10:11,530
Why didn't a pick
pocket stole it?

897
02:10:16,512 --> 02:10:19,345
lt's a big network in Mumbai.
-There is 1000 more ppl involved.

898
02:10:19,481 --> 02:10:21,073
Sure there will be 1
leader for all of them.

899
02:10:21,216 --> 02:10:22,774
That's belongs to
Cembor Ravi's area.

900
02:10:23,018 --> 02:10:27,887
Sure ppl who escaped have informed
that we're searching for that tape too.

901
02:10:28,023 --> 02:10:29,786
Before he gets the tape,

902
02:10:30,926 --> 02:10:32,188
we must get it.

903
02:10:39,201 --> 02:10:40,099
Why you came this far?

904
02:10:40,235 --> 02:10:43,363
Two days ago, Viswa's friend thing
got missing at Mahim station.

905
02:10:43,505 --> 02:10:46,599
ls it with you?
Or whom can we seek for it?

906
02:10:46,742 --> 02:10:49,267
ls your friend a big shot?
-Why?

907
02:10:49,411 --> 02:10:53,643
Just now Bheema came
asking the same thing.

908
02:10:55,083 --> 02:10:55,913
Who took it?

909
02:10:56,051 --> 02:10:59,817
That area belongs to Bendra Raju.
- Do you have his phone number?

910
02:11:01,590 --> 02:11:03,353
Bheema is going on our track.

911
02:11:05,994 --> 02:11:07,188
But he is heading us.

912
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:46,667
What happened?
Didn't get his number?

913
02:11:47,202 --> 02:11:48,726
He's somewhere in a bar.

914
02:11:49,504 --> 02:11:51,096
How many bars in Bhendra?

915
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:52,831
There is 6 to 7 bars.

916
02:11:58,847 --> 02:12:00,075
What song is this?
Hindi?

917
02:12:02,050 --> 02:12:02,812
Bhojpuri.

918
02:12:03,385 --> 02:12:06,013
Where is the most Bhojpuri
ppl located?

919
02:12:06,655 --> 02:12:07,849
He's not in this bar.

920
02:12:08,090 --> 02:12:09,387
Go and check the other bar.

921
02:13:12,988 --> 02:13:16,185
As l thought, Viswa have found
the place where the tape is.

922
02:13:16,825 --> 02:13:20,261
He's on the way to
Bhanderas to get Nandu.

923
02:13:20,395 --> 02:13:24,661
lf he get him before we did,
we will get caught.

924
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:28,964
l will take care.
- Bhanderas, who is Nandu?

925
02:13:30,138 --> 02:13:31,400
l need his number fast!

926
02:13:42,284 --> 02:13:44,343
Do you have Bhanderas Nandu's
phone number? - l don't have.

927
02:13:47,923 --> 02:13:50,357
Do you have pick pocket
Nandu's number? - No.

928
02:14:00,969 --> 02:14:01,697

929
02:14:02,738 --> 02:14:03,636
We got the number.

930
02:14:15,016 --> 02:14:16,108
l will talk to you later.

931
02:14:47,883 --> 02:14:49,180
Keep on talking to him,
don't stop.

932
02:15:08,403 --> 02:15:10,769
Pick up!

933
02:15:25,253 --> 02:15:28,222
Don't let him put down.
- Ask him where is the company?

934
02:15:57,652 --> 02:15:58,550
You go ahead.

935
02:17:15,764 --> 02:17:16,924
You wasted a vada.

936
02:17:23,138 --> 02:17:24,730
Where is the cassette you
stole at the Mahim station?!

937
02:17:24,873 --> 02:17:26,170
You won't get all that.

938
02:17:27,442 --> 02:17:29,410
But we have vada bread.
Do you want?

939
02:17:34,950 --> 02:17:38,351
A new evidence about the recent
clash have been exposed.

940
02:17:38,486 --> 02:17:42,047
A video tape have been presented
as an important evidence to this case.

941
02:17:42,190 --> 02:17:46,456
Ppl who involved in this
case is Bheema a gangster,

942
02:17:46,695 --> 02:17:50,654
and Sub lnspector RanjiVarma
has been seen in that video.

943
02:17:51,299 --> 02:17:57,295
And in the video shows that Minister
Krishna and Bheema have started this clash.

944
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:00,840
Who is Bheema? What is the link
between a rowdy and me?!

945
02:18:01,676 --> 02:18:07,114
This is a drama planned by my
opponents to drag me down.

946
02:18:09,951 --> 02:18:10,940
Wait!

947
02:18:11,119 --> 02:18:12,484
You have showed your
dirty politic face!

948
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:14,815
Your death is in my hand!
Wait and see.

949
02:18:31,539 --> 02:18:33,666
How is your place?
Comfortable?

950
02:18:36,444 --> 02:18:37,706
You used to this place right.

951
02:18:39,681 --> 02:18:45,313
l was here for 1 7 years.
To kill your father.

952
02:18:45,653 --> 02:18:48,417
But now l'm in to kill you.

953
02:18:49,858 --> 02:18:52,224
You will kill me?
- l will!

954
02:18:54,195 --> 02:18:55,787
But you need to be alive right.

955
02:18:56,831 --> 02:18:59,857
My father is a good man.
He let you live.

956
02:19:00,535 --> 02:19:01,797
But l...

957
02:19:07,842 --> 02:19:09,810
He shouldn't see the
sunrise tomorrow.

958
02:19:32,534 --> 02:19:34,297
What happened?
He's death.

959
02:20:21,616 --> 02:20:23,447
Minister must be
very angry with us.

960
02:20:23,585 --> 02:20:24,745
How will he help us?

961
02:20:26,988 --> 02:20:29,786
Only he can help us to
escape from this case.

962
02:20:50,145 --> 02:20:51,840
We have vada bread,
do you want?

963
02:20:54,382 --> 02:20:55,314
Call for you.

964
02:20:59,621 --> 02:21:01,418
What is happening there Bheema?

965
02:21:02,524 --> 02:21:04,287
l couldn't do as l said.

966
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:08,151
But l'm doing as
what you said.

967
02:21:10,565 --> 02:21:11,395
You're a great person.

968
02:21:13,368 --> 02:21:16,030
You have killed Minister
as you said.

969
02:21:17,205 --> 02:21:19,435
l would like to learn
all this from you.

970
02:21:22,243 --> 02:21:23,574
But you won't
be alive longer.

971
02:21:26,714 --> 02:21:28,147
How to kill you
just like that.

972
02:21:28,316 --> 02:21:29,840
l planned your
escape from jail.

973
02:21:30,084 --> 02:21:33,645
Go.
lt won't miss this time.

974
02:21:33,788 --> 02:21:36,313
lt's a murder case.
Very strong.

975
02:22:13,628 --> 02:22:15,425
Now the power is
in our hand.

976
02:22:16,264 --> 02:22:19,427
No politicians above us,
so do criminals.

977
02:22:19,567 --> 02:22:21,194
You can take as many
force you want.

978
02:22:21,336 --> 02:22:23,167
Bheema and his men
shouldn't be alive!

979
02:22:26,774 --> 02:22:29,402
lf we didn't destroy Viswa,
lt's us who going to destroy!

980
02:22:29,544 --> 02:22:34,880
Today is 'Maha Siva Rathiri'.
Everyone will be celebrating tonight.

981
02:22:35,016 --> 02:22:38,281
At this time he must be murdered.

982
02:22:58,206 --> 02:23:01,505
Uncle, why bringing me here?
-You're helping everyone when hard times.

983
02:23:01,643 --> 02:23:03,167
Won't you join them
when happy times?! Sit.

984
02:23:14,822 --> 02:23:16,050
No, thanks.

985
02:23:16,190 --> 02:23:19,125
lt's not milk,
it's called 'Bhongu'.

986
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:22,423
Need to drink on 'Sivarathiri'.

987
02:23:26,734 --> 02:23:29,294
lt's not milk,
it's called 'Bhongu'.

988
02:23:29,537 --> 02:23:31,937
Need to drink on 'Sivarathiri'.
lt's the custom.

989
02:23:32,373 --> 02:23:35,342
lt's not milk,
it's called 'Bhongu'.

990
02:23:35,677 --> 02:23:39,078
Need to drink on 'Sivarathiri'.
lt's the custom.

991
02:24:46,180 --> 02:24:47,238
A dance?

992
02:24:50,051 --> 02:24:50,881
Song?

993
02:24:52,820 --> 02:24:54,378
Bhongu.

994
02:24:55,456 --> 02:24:58,391
Who is there?
One bhongu for my bro.

995
02:25:11,272 --> 02:25:12,637
Now...

996
02:25:23,484 --> 02:25:24,610
Sing.

997
02:30:33,427 --> 02:30:37,193
She's asking about your mother!
She's from police department!

998
02:31:58,045 --> 02:31:59,478
See what have they done?

999
02:32:00,214 --> 02:32:02,045
We got scared that they
did something to you too.

1000
02:32:53,234 --> 02:32:55,293
l didn't know.

1001
02:33:05,546 --> 02:33:09,642
We didn't know what happened.
We saw their bodies in the morning.

1002
02:33:10,117 --> 02:33:12,210
We got so scared thinking they
have done something to you too.

1003
02:33:17,124 --> 02:33:19,319
Everyone who
was here for you left you.

1004
02:33:19,460 --> 02:33:22,861
They even didn't leave
the girl who loved you.

1005
02:33:22,997 --> 02:33:25,056
l mistakenly doubt her..

1006
02:33:36,176 --> 02:33:40,306
Where is uncle?
- l have searched for him everywhere.

1007
02:33:40,447 --> 02:33:43,143
We're scared he might
be killed too.

1008
02:33:48,923 --> 02:33:50,447
Call for you.

1009
02:33:53,060 --> 02:33:54,823
Many of you ppl
died for you.

1010
02:33:55,996 --> 02:33:57,623
Don't sacrifice one more life.

1011
02:33:59,033 --> 02:34:00,625
lf you want back your uncle...

1012
02:34:02,303 --> 02:34:03,793
You must come alone.

1013
02:34:18,185 --> 02:34:19,277
You stay here.

1014
02:35:05,599 --> 02:35:09,057
You only need me right?
Let him go...

1015
02:35:44,671 --> 02:35:47,071
You told me,
using him we can get Anna.

1016
02:35:47,207 --> 02:35:48,231
lt happened.

1017
02:35:48,509 --> 02:35:50,909
And told me,
using you to get Viswa.

1018
02:35:51,045 --> 02:35:51,909
And it happened too.

1019
02:35:52,046 --> 02:35:54,640
You destroyed his
whole empire in one night.

1020
02:35:54,782 --> 02:35:55,908
You such a great person.

1021
02:35:57,518 --> 02:35:58,849
Murali, where are you?

1022
02:36:16,703 --> 02:36:17,829
l'm here.
Where are you?

1023
02:36:39,893 --> 02:36:40,723
Who are you all?!

1024
02:37:03,217 --> 02:37:05,549
Only left is Viswa.

1025
02:38:16,256 --> 02:38:19,054
Why are you referring
as a great person.

1026
02:38:19,826 --> 02:38:22,795
l was doing everything
you asked. l will continue doing.

1027
02:38:24,097 --> 02:38:29,194
Ask the builders company
to chase ppl from Mahim.

1028
02:38:29,336 --> 02:38:32,931
And take the land.
After this no one will oppose you.

1029
02:38:39,613 --> 02:38:41,513
Whatever it is,
he is my brother's son.

1030
02:38:42,082 --> 02:38:43,379
He's still alive.

1031
02:38:44,718 --> 02:38:46,242
Don't take time.
Finish him off.

1032
02:38:48,722 --> 02:38:49,780
l'll make a move.

1033
02:38:56,964 --> 02:38:57,988
Get in.
Let's go.

1034
02:38:58,131 --> 02:38:59,530
Brother is not coming?
- Get in.

1035
02:39:01,935 --> 02:39:03,266
Dad, where is he?

1036
02:39:03,870 --> 02:39:04,734
Give me the phone.

1037
02:39:11,044 --> 02:39:12,511
Bheema have murdered Viswa.

1038
02:39:13,180 --> 02:39:15,580
You can arrest Bheema
if you go there now.

1039
02:39:16,550 --> 02:39:18,518
What are you talking?!
What happened to him?!

1040
02:39:18,952 --> 02:39:19,884
l have killed him.

1041
02:39:21,021 --> 02:39:24,047
Pass me the cash as you said,
and get the Mahim port.

1042
02:39:26,526 --> 02:39:28,460
What is going on?
What are you doing?!

1043
02:39:28,895 --> 02:39:33,332
He never listen me that we can live
wealthy after all we went thru.

1044
02:39:34,601 --> 02:39:36,262
He never live wealthy
and didn't let me too.

1045
02:39:36,403 --> 02:39:39,133
That is why l bring
Viswa back here and get him.

1046
02:39:40,040 --> 02:39:42,907
But l didn't think Viswa will
take over his dad's place.

1047
02:39:44,311 --> 02:39:47,678
l was working for my brother,
and now need to work for his son?!

1048
02:39:48,348 --> 02:39:51,317
After this there won't
Bheema nor Viswa.

1049
02:39:51,818 --> 02:39:54,514
After this l'm the leader,
you're my assistant.

1050
02:41:04,257 --> 02:41:06,851
We received information that
Bheema have murdered Viswa.

1051
02:41:07,094 --> 02:41:10,063
Bheema and his men
at the murder spot.

1052
02:41:10,630 --> 02:41:13,155
What are you saying.
-You can arrest them if you go now.

1053
02:45:58,785 --> 02:46:01,652
What happened?
- Bheema and rest tried to escape.

1054
02:46:02,122 --> 02:46:03,089
That is why..

1055
02:46:15,301 --> 02:46:19,032
l thought the thing l loved
most is my profession,

1056
02:46:20,473 --> 02:46:25,809
But l get to know that
l love Viswa more than this.

1057
02:46:30,850 --> 02:46:32,784
Where are you heading
to without telling anyone?

1058
02:46:34,854 --> 02:46:37,755
No one can oppose Viswa
in Mumbai after this.

1059
02:46:39,092 --> 02:46:40,582
That is why l'm getting
out from here.

1060
02:46:41,027 --> 02:46:43,427
Few months later...

1061
02:47:09,122 --> 02:47:11,886
Lawyer Radhakrishnan
is here to see you.

1062
02:47:18,631 --> 02:47:19,290
Yesterday had a case,

1063
02:47:21,735 --> 02:47:24,670
l only could fight in court..

1064
02:47:25,839 --> 02:47:29,400
but didn't get justice.

1065
02:47:29,539 --> 02:48:46,400
