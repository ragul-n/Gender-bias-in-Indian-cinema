26
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,666
Ratanlal Bagula.

27
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,335
Sub-inspector.

28
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,043
You're in our custody today.

29
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,409
We're going to question you..

30
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,452
...until you don't give us answers.

31
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,717
Who was she?

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,351
How did you know her?

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,758
You don't know that“

34
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,487
...you're a police officer yourself?

35
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,564
Tell <i>us...</i>

36
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,125
...how it happened?

37
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,537
Who paid you to do this job?

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,606
How were you connected to that girl?

39
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,341
How were you connected to that girl?

40
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,320
Sir, this is Satyakam.

41
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,718
Shyam Dada.

42
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,624
JB sir.

43
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,220
How were you connected?

44
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,263
Sir.

45
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,485
Bagula.

46
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,190
I am the head of this investigation.

47
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,224
Arun Roy.

48
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,428
And my study is..

49
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,467
...you'll be rotting behind bars for a long time.

50
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,035
Be sure.

51
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,407
I can help you.

52
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,711
<i>H you...</i>

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,120
...help me.

54
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,485
<i>Look...</i>

55
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,694
Bagula, I know that the..

56
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:42,557
...person who shook up the law and country is a girl.

57
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,567
Her name isn't Sigdi.

58
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,069
Her real name is Kaanchi.

59
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,607
I can see confirmation in your eyes.

60
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,208
Right?

61
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,016
We will catch her, soon.

62
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,090
Be sure of that.

63
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:14,188
Soon she will be behind bars.

64
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,298
And maybe...she'll face rigorous punishment.

65
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,335
What difference does it make, sir?

66
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,046
It won't make a difference to her if you hang her.

67
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,013
She will just smile.

68
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,581
She's a b***h.

69
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,389
Forget it, sir.

70
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,131
<i>Look...</i>

71
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,688
I want to know everything.

72
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,326
I want to know the real story.

73
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,664
A petite girl like her can't do such a big job.

74
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,103
It's impossible.

75
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,266
What's the truth behind these facts?

76
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,406
How are you related to Kaanchi?

77
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,038
We're friends.

78
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,179
Since we were kids.

79
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,187
We studied in the same village, the same school.

80
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,195
She was junior to me.

81
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,061
Seven years ago I came to Mumbai.

82
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,304
And she grew up there...

83
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,076
in that village.

84
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,445
Koshampa.

85
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,345
A village for retired army soldiers in Uttrakhand.

86
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,248
She was the star of that place.

87
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,480
Kaanchi.

88
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,102
Kaanchi!

89
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,073
How did they get in Kakda Land without permission?

90
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,236
<i>"The scorching heat, cooling shade."</i>

91
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,301
<i>"Entire village against one small girl."</i>

92
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,281
<i>"Wouldn't you want to know her name?"</i>

93
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,681
<i>"Kaanchi."</i>

94
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,553
<i>"Scorching heat, cooling shade."</i>

95
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,722
<i>"Entire village versus one small girl."</i>

96
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,528
<i>"Wouldn't you want to know her name?"</i>

97
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,201
<i>"Kaanchi."</i>

98
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,463
<i>"Kaanchi."</i>

99
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,418
<i>"You're fragile like glass."</i>

100
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,616
<i>"She's like fire."</i>

101
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,264
<i>"She's a girl from my country."</i>

102
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:40,262
<i>"Let the world know...hello, hi."</i>

103
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,633
<i>"She displays all the seven colors."</i>

104
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,306
<i>"The entire world's assessed from her heart."</i>

105
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,145
<i>"Kaanchi."</i>

106
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,642
Kaanchi!

107
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,651
Kaanchi!

108
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,584
Kaanchi!

109
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,552
Kaanchi!

110
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,518
Kaanchi!

111
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,284
Kaanchi!

112
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,322
Kaanchi!

113
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,325
Kaanchi!

114
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,602
Kaanchi!

115
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,144
Kaanchi!

116
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,577
You played foul.

117
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,410
Get lost.

118
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,478
Why you..

119
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,577
"Kaanchi."

120
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,323
"Kaanchi."

121
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,399
We've to turn this Koshampa valley..

122
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,103
“Into JB Koshampa city in a year.

123
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,645
World class valley.

124
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,716
And anyone who causes obstructions“

125
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:36,382
...will be responsible for his position and life.

126
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,250
Don't you know who you slapped?

127
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,256
Yes, I know.

128
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,384
He's that scoundrel inspector Bhagwafis son.

129
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,655
You hurled the trophy which the MLA presented you.

130
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,287
You're no princess.

131
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,035
What else did you expect?

132
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:48,152
I was holding the trophy in my hands..

133
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,291
...so that's what I hurled at him.

134
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,028
You're still arguing with me.

135
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,627
You're a girl still you abuse people.

136
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,033
What do you expect?

137
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,334
Did you want me to bow before that rascal?

138
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:57,337
Be quiet.

139
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,560
Don't beat her.

140
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,570
Get her married. Her in-laws will do the beating.

141
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,774
Get going-

142
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,347
Nirman Singh, will Kaanchi ever change.

143
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,612
N eve r.

144
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,709
What?

145
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
That Deepu complained to mother?

146
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,282
Yes. To mother.

147
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,758
And he even cried before her.

148
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:17,839
Kaanchi.

149
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:19,586
Where are you going?

150
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,567
Please spare some change.

151
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,733
Please spare some change.

152
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,372
Hold it!

153
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,743
Hi-five..

154
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,639
Did you complain to my mother?

155
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,273
Yes, I did. So?

156
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,041
Why you..

157
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,385
Now go complain to her again“

158
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,389
“that I slapped you again.

159
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,659
And this is in advance..

160
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,527
...for the next time you complain to her.

161
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,533
- You'll get it tomorrow.
- That's okay.

162
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,296
Hail Goddess!

163
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,165
She slapped my son, now watch“

164
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,107
...how I sc*** her and her family.

165
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,199
Mind your tongue.

166
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,506
Okay, here. See.

167
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,605
You will all have to mind your tongues.

168
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,379
When Kakda family comes to Koshampa..

169
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,512
“And exterminates all of you.

170
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,157
Binda has given Kaanchi an apt name.

171
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,453
'Sigdi' (furnace).

172
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:26,654
Kaanchi's the brave daughter of my brave son.

173
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:31,098
If you mess with her, she will roar back.

174
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,331
So do you women want to burn everything down?

175
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:38,541
Your father...
died in the Kashmir war.

176
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,373
He left us few pieces of land.

177
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:46,546
Now Khajra, Bhagwat will trouble us to sell the lands.

178
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,117
We were born in Koshampa..

179
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,620
“And we'll die here.

180
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,421
Your Binda has gone crazy..

181
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,653
...by doing rounds of the court.

182
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,059
And you..

183
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,824
If you keep picking fights with government officials“

184
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,998
“won't they make our life difficult.

185
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,759
Even if we all join hands..

186
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,299
...we still can't face this storm

187
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,601
Mother, who are you talking to?

188
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,236
<i>You.</i>

189
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,093
Mother, you're singing in the wrong tune.

190
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,193
And the words are wrong too.

191
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,764
<i>Mother...</i>

192
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,536
It's been 19 years since..

193
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,737
“I've been hearing this wrong lullaby.

194
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:52,514
The words can be wrong, but the meaning is right.

195
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,285
Can I say something?

196
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,220
If I say sorry will you forgive me?

197
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,568
Sorry, mother.

198
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,141
Don't cry.

199
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,477
She's crying.

200
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,486
Fine, go on cry.

201
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,054
Wretch“

202
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,759
Only one man can set you right.

203
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,751
Your Binda.

204
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,455
Let him set himself right first.

205
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,734
Who does he think he is?

206
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,760
Is he back from the city or not?

207
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,499
No. He never tells me.

208
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,480
One, two, three, four, five..

209
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,177
One, two, three“

210
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,617
Come on, come on.
Faster. Faster.

211
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,282
<i>Faster.</i>

212
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,289
Yes, sir!

213
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,290
Five, six...

214
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,258
Faster. Faster.

215
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,657
Come on, come on.

216
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,563
Come on

217
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,728
30..

218
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,663
29..

219
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,759
Come on, come on.

220
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,163
28...Z7...Z6...

221
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,710
Come on.
Go back to training.

222
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,734
Come on.

223
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,039
Z4.

224
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,379
Your hands are amazing.

225
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,580
Kamla, you haven't seen my magic yet.

226
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,657
Come on, I'll show you magic.

227
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,714
- Hey..
- Quiet.

228
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,370
She falls down intentionally.

229
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:44,217
Don't I know?

230
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,490
So that Binda picks her up and..

231
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,225
...touches her under the pretext of applying balm.

232
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,528
If you feel jealous then don't come to my compound?

233
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,795
Learn if you want to, or else leave.

234
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:52,961
Fine, I won't come.

235
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:54,460
Don't try to boss me, wretch.

236
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,029
What did you say?

237
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,472
Scoundrel“

238
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,773
Get going all of you.

239
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,007
No anger.
No anger at all.

240
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,113
Binda has to look after all the students.

241
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,118
- That wretch“
- No abusing.

242
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,710
Girls don't abuse.

243
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,423
- You don't know that ***
- For my sake.

244
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,717
Fine.

245
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,259
He loves you.

246
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,160
I see. ls this love?

247
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,698
He applied ointment on her back..

248
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,664
Quiet!

249
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,159
I am quiet.

250
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,062
He's returned tired and worn out from the city..

251
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,197
“And is already training.

252
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,372
He's also brought gift for you and your mother.

253
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,372
I don't want any gift.

254
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,141
He didn't even say sorry.

255
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,510
Scoundrel“

256
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,049
Get lost.

257
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,052
Papa, why are you wasting time on her?

258
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,613
- Because I like her.
- I see.

259
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,283
Give me one reason.

260
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,416
She's untainted, honest.

261
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,085
And second, she's my martyr friend“

262
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,461
“soldier Surat Singh's daughter.

263
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,166
She still steps out wearing his army belt.

264
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,530
With pride.

265
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,194
Is that the only reason?

266
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,670
Yes .

267
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,305
Papa...you're totally great.

268
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,036
Completely.

269
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,356
Have some shame?

270
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,491
What's shameful in this?

271
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,546
Return the towel.

272
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,191
First I want to know why did you stay so long in the city?

273
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,756
I went to see a girl for myself.

274
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,525
Papa said so.

275
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:33,635
Did you find one?

276
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,535
Her name's Haseena.

277
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,706
Is she more beautiful than me?

278
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,141
Every other girl's more beautiful than you.

279
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,270
- Lie.
- And one more thing.

280
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,673
I went to see a boy for you.

281
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,648
Your mother asked me to do so.

282
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,774
So did you find one?

283
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,020
You'll be really happy to see him.

284
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,152
Then do one thing.

285
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,184
Come like this to my house.

286
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:56,521
Hey! Kaanchi.

287
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,386
Kaanchi.

288
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,492
Hey naked, here's your towel.

289
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,294
Cover yourself.

290
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,017
Binda.

291
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,051
Yes, Pa Pa-

292
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,051
Son, are you okay?

293
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,616
Sorry, P3Pa-

294
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,386
I forgot to take the towel.

295
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,428
You forgot to take the towel.

296
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,397
Don't feel shy from me.

297
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:37,763
Here you go.

298
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,562
Tell me...what's your new plan?

299
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,135
See what I do tomorrow, papa.

300
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,708
I'll take a gorgeous face along for her.

301
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,241
Let me introduce you.

302
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,375
This is Paddu Pahalwan.

303
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,517
Hailing from the village Surajmukhi.

304
00:17:56,675 --> 00:18:01,181
Famous singer, Basya Maharaj is his father.

305
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:05,962
And harlot Reshma Bai is his mother.

306
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,992
Paddu Pahalwan is their youngest son.

307
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,499
Actually speaking his name is Padam Singh.

308
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,029
I really like the boy.

309
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,229
Paddu.

310
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,573
We won't find a rich boy like him again.

311
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,640
He's nice, sister.

312
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,147
Take him home once.

313
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,246
Can I say something?

314
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,420
I was looking for a successful man like him.

315
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,027
I don't want a fair, handsome looking mouse.

316
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,062
I am ready for the marriage.

317
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,191
Start preparing for the marriage.

318
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,548
Binda, you just lit the furnace.

319
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,442
Go inside and see the consequences of your charade.

320
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,271
She's Kaanchi.

321
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,678
Glass may shatter, but not Kaanchi.

322
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,049
What do I do with this crazy girl?

323
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,618
You teased her, now you convince her.

324
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,723
She couldn't take a small joke.

325
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,458
She troubles me all day long.

326
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,265
Kaanchi.

327
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,766
<i>"Ev, Sigdi.</i>

328
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,521
<i>"The goat gazed on the grass."</i>

329
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,057
<i>"The girl got scared."</i>

330
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,524
<i>"Crossed the seven seas."</i>

331
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,529
<i>"And drove everyone insane."</i>

332
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,603
Scared?

333
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:30,468
Yes .

334
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,305
What would you have done ifl had died?

335
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,801
Followed you.

336
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,273
Why?

337
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,442
'89' YOUr point?

338
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,052
What?

339
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,483
Should I say it or do it?

340
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,093
Do it.

341
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,471
I almost forgot.

342
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,112
Papa gave me this, it was for you.

343
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,374
I told him to remind me.

344
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,110
I gave the t-shirts, bags and everything else, but“

345
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,446
“but one should give this beautiful bracelet“

346
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,077
...to the beautiful girl first.

347
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,053
Get lost. Rascal.

348
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,322
Next time you do something like this..

349
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,526
...l'll hang you from a rope.

350
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,760
That fatty was right for you.

351
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:34,828
You should marry..

352
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:36,725
I'm looking for a fatty for you too.

353
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,740
Find me one.

354
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,037
I'll have real fun with a fatty.

355
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,371
This girl has no fear of death.

356
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,046
When it comes to teach someone a lesson..

357
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:50,314
...her brain runs faster than a computer.

358
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,649
One.

359
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,157
Two

360
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,819
Three.

361
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,619
Four.

362
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,736
Now keep stretched.

363
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:01,385
Everyone stand straight.

364
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,395
Come on.

365
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,164
Brother, Kakda's men are here to buy our land.

366
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,744
Good morning, Binda.

367
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,022
Good morning.

368
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,564
Good morning.

369
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,507
You still have an eye.

370
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,037
I do, Binda.

371
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,040
There's 2 million, in this bag.

372
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,718
And Kakda sir has sent it especially for you.

373
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,650
All you need to do is sign.

374
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,523
One sign, chapter close.

375
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,027
You don't get such an opportunity, try to understand.

376
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,393
- Give it.
- Yes.

377
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,769
- Take a look.
- It's heavy.

378
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,205
Chandu, give it to papa.

379
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,170
<i>O</i> kaY-

380
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:43,884
Thank you, Khajura.

381
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,288
Thank you.

382
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,535
Hold on.

383
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,371
Just one sign.
One sign.

384
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,338
Very good.

385
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,314
Very good.

386
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,783
Very good. Very good.

387
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,999
What are you doing?

388
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:01,446
This is cheating.

389
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,626
What have you done?

390
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,655
The school needed money, Khajura.

391
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,426
Because I need money to defend my case against you.

392
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,980
You don't get it, Binda.

393
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,187
This is cheating.

394
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,295
Your bosses are doing the cheating.

395
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,305
They bought the lands of the soldiers by paying peanuts.

396
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,363
You won't get a sq.ft.

397
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,373
If you play games like this“

398
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,604
“then Kakda sir won't spare you.

399
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,779
Who is Kakda?

400
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,751
Why don't you bring this weakling before me?

401
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,213
If Jhoomar Babu shakes hands with Binda..

402
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,314
...his fingers will crack.

403
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,583
Do you want to see his strength?

404
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,157
I'll see his later.

405
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,129
First let's test yours.

406
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,101
Go, go to the court.

407
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,266
Let's see who is Jhoomar Babu Kakda.

408
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,678
Sorry, sir.

409
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,277
Bakula here.

410
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:08,384
Wrong timing but right information, sir.

411
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,094
Sir, engineer Pandey turned about to be a ratter.

412
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,254
Yes, sir.

413
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,059
He leaked all the information“

414
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,034
“about the Uttranchal Project to Davar's CA.

415
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,530
For 100 million.

416
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,767
Yes, sir.

417
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,769
What did he say?

418
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,341
What else.

419
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,673
Kill him.

420
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,549
Koshampa Valley project is a scam.

421
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,518
Mr. Jhumar didn't hesitate“

422
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:41,319
...to seize the lands of old retired soldiers.

423
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:45,486
Because he's supported by politicians.

424
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,220
Beware of him.

425
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,984
Okay, sir.

426
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,987
Yes, I am Neeraj Pandey.

427
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,106
Jimmy.

428
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,733
It's your brother.

429
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,479
- Yes, brother.
- As your elder brother“

430
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,573
“I've tried telling you many times“

431
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,278
...that every job should be done with a system.

432
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,280
Try to understand.

433
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:50,788
Small mistakes lead to the destruction of the rich.

434
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:56,027
I had a word with the Chief Minister of that state.

435
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,628
We'll have to go to Koshampa once.

436
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:00,993
You will have Koshampa..

437
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,529
“But only through political influence.

438
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,406
Through a system.

474
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:27,066
You look rich, can't you afford a driver?

475
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,604
No. I like it alone.

476
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,506
Listen.

477
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,189
Can you show me the way to sunset point?

478
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,559
Look, if you help me out...

479
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,494
...it'll be nice.

480
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,628
That's fine.

481
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,194
How do I tell you?

482
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,772
Do one thing.

483
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,540
See this path.

484
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,598
Take this route down.

485
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,507
Up ahead you'll find a dirt road.

486
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,444
Take a right from there.

487
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,379
Next you'll come across a hillock.

488
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,508
Jump on it.

489
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,383
And as soon as cross that“

490
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,387
...you will come across a lake.

491
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,679
After you cross that“

492
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,725
...Narayan Temple is 40 steps ahead.

493
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,460
Look.
You can see it from here.

494
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,757
That's where Sunset Point is.

495
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,756
You'll get there in no time.

496
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,432
Get it?

497
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,662
Interesting.

498
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,668
But I don't understand shortcuts.

499
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,738
You don't get shortcuts?

500
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:32,536
It's right in the middle.

501
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,777
You'll get there in 2 minutes.

502
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,172
If you could sit in the car..

503
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,307
“And direct me to Sunset point“

504
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,351
...l'll be obliged.

505
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,743
I like painting.

506
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,551
So it's important to see Sunset Point.

507
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,519
So please.

508
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,620
Will you help me?

509
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,758
Papa and uncle are here too.

510
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,037
Koshampa Valley Project belongs to us.

511
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,528
<i>Oh“.</i>

512
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,734
So you're Kakda.

513
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,600
Strange name, right?

514
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,737
Yes, but I am not like my uncle and papa.

515
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,412
I am different.

516
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,483
You see, I am an artist.

517
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,382
Simple nature lover.

518
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,119
Beautiful Koshampa.

519
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,087
Magical painting.

520
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,625
I want to paint it from every angle.

521
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:29,756
If you show me a beautiful spot like this every day?

522
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,326
Who will do the work?

523
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,528
My father.

524
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,199
You're right.

525
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,240
I'll pay you 1000 Rs. every day.

526
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,035
A reward for your work.

527
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,771
Like..

528
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,639
Like a tourist guide.

529
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,546
I hope I didn't hurt you.

530
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,413
I paint too.

531
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,085
Wow, that's great.

532
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,416
Then we can respect each other.

533
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,685
Come, I'll drop you home.

534
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,491
The children are waiting.

535
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,097
No.

536
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,363
I'll take this route.

537
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,195

- So did you take it?
- Yes. Look.

541
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,412
Free note.

542
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:26,078
Kaanchi, people's trouble start with this free note.

543
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:29,181
But I want this to deposit in the school.

544
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,686
Donation.

545
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,594
How's the SUV?

546
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,091
Better than you.

547
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,590
Because he gave you a note?

548
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,232
He respects me, not like you.

549
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,030
Fine, go around with him.

550
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,766
And then come back to me.

551
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,537
Jealous.

552
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:04,593
The General Secretary of India's favorite political party.

553
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:08,390
Creator of many leaders, benefactor of the poor..

554
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:12,262
...Shyam Dada will say a few words.

555
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,763
Hello.

556
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,110
I didn't come here to give a speech.

557
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,615
I came here to confess some of my crimes.

558
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:33,249
Everything my secretary said is a lie.

559
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:37,253
That, "lam great, I am this, I..."

560
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,524
N01 "0, no, no.

561
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,122
The truth is that“

562
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:48,662
...we've tarnished the image of this country.

563
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,167
We've tarnished our own image.

564
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,248
We've donned new garbs of corruption.

565
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:06,647
We've played sleazy games for power and position.

566
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,250
The truth is I did nothing“

567
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,660
...that I should've done for the country.

568
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:23,104
So I want you to let your children join politics.

569
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,530
So that they can lead the progress of the country..

570
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,405
...in the right direction.

571
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,579
Sorry.

572
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,750
I've nothing more to say.

573
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,453
He's playing mind-games.

574
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,609
Hail India.

575
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:43,475
Hail Koshampa.

576
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:51,057
JB Kakda, who's going to build Koshampa valley here..

577
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,262
...we'll say a few words to you.

578
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,736
My brother...

579
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:03,379
...Shyam Dada's weakness is..

580
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:07,142
...he crosses all limits of modesty.

581
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:11,209
He just said he did nothing.

582
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:15,616
I want to ask, if he hasn't done anything“

583
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,256
...then who helped this country progress?

584
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:26,196
Roads, dams, airport, school, technology“

585
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,334
...who built all this.

586
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:32,530
All this is the creation of your vision, brother.

587
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:35,234
Due to your efforts.

588
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,413
He has the habit of taking blame..

589
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,246
...for the dirty jobs of the other politicians.

590
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,342
My brother is great.

591
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,582
My brother is great!

592
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,383
Teach your children to progress this country.

593
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,128
Make money.

594
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:56,063
Make money in every way.

595
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,292
Greed...

596
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,631
...is nothing bad, it's a good thing.

597
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,003
<i>"Money..."</i>

598
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,698
<i>"What's money?"</i>

599
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,531
<i>"Nothing's like it."</i>

600
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,736
<i>"Like money."</i>

601
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,991
What are you thinking, Jhoomar?

602
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,665
That you're peeling an orange.

603
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,730
Orange?

604
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:39,036
These days' politics is like this orange.

605
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,610
Different from the inside“

606
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,669
“and different on the outside.

607
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,151
Here...eat it.

608
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,719
So...what did you learn from me today?

609
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,086
That always tell the people..

610
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,358
“What they want to hear.

611
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,092
Very good.

612
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:10,070
But, Jhoomar, sometimes you get too loud. Loud.

613
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,731
Brother, I am what I am.

614
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:12,736
This is how I am.

615
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,442
I am not a hypocrite.

616
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,153
Shushant sir liked her simplicity“

617
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,563
“and Kaanchi liked his humbleness, sir.

618
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:03,154
We don't know what anyone wrote or taught us.

619
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,488
- Kaanchi.
- Yes.

620
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,492
Straight.

621
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:09,224
We just know three things.

622
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,497
1.Fear no evil.

623
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,633
2.Do what is right.

624
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,231
And 3. Fight for your right.

625
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,703
Where's the India that was better than the rest?

626
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,614
Who'll be the leader of the people?

627
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,413
And who will be the benefactor of India.

628
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,642
We.

629
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,280
All of us.

630
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,180
<i>Me.</i>

631
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,083
Myself.

632
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,524
Me alone.

633
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,553
My strength, my honesty.

634
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,760
- Is it true?
- It is.

635
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,591
- Is it true?
- It is.

636
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,634
Is it true?

637
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,669
I like this man.

638
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,205
He's my best friend. Binda.

639
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,073
And me?

640
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,536
We just met.
Good friend.

641
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,714
But doesn't he talk too much.

642
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,340
Exactly.

643
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,979
I tired of explaining him.

644
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,714
He's such a bore, right?

645
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,652
Tell me...can a single man change the entire country.

646
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,391
If it's like this, then so be it.

647
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,689
We've to lessen the distance between the rich and the poor.

648
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,171
Bravo.

649
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,738
I heard that young man likes some local beauty.

650
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,080
Shall we abduct her?

651
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,114
But that's not right, uncle.

652
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,677
Ia-

653
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,474
I mean..

654
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,185
Say it.
You're sc***.

655
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,653
You're in love with her.
What?

656
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,026
How do I explain it?

657
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,725
I like meeting her.

658
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,568
The way she talks.

659
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,019
The way she moves.

660
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,164
She's the best gift of God in Koshampa.

661
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,633
I see, let's do one thing then.

662
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,433
Let's sell Koshampa..

663
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,202
“And bring your 'God's gift' here.

664
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,341
What do you say?

665
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,399
Yes .

666
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,740
I want to make her mine.

667
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,448
So the fever's all time high.

668
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,175
Go ahead, son.

669
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,201
Let the heat off.

670
00:40:10,227 --> 00:40:12,542
When you cool down, you can come to me.

671
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,055
<i>O</i> kaY-

672
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,549
Do you know what brother's biggest mistake is?

673
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,024
This boy here.

674
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,425
Lover boy.

675
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,129
Come on.

676
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:43,208
You know, today I am going to make a painting of you..

677
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,311
...more beautiful than you.

678
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:46,783
Why?

679
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:48,282
Am I not beautiful?

680
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,153
You are.

681
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,520
But colorless.

682
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,660
There's lack of color in you.

683
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,522
Yes...

684
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,325
...so you are there...
to fill in the colors.

685
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,656
That's right.

686
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,066
That's why you will have to“

687
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,264
...close your eyes like a divine idol.

688
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,203
Please, come on.

689
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,468
<i>O</i> kaY-

690
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:07,732
Perfect.

691
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,476
You know, I love red color.

692
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,777
And this red color will look beautiful on your lips.

693
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,547
I hope you didn't mind that.

694
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,652
I want to go home.

695
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,439
- I want to complete my painting“

696
00:41:30,465 --> 00:41:31,788
- I want to go home.

697
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,249
'Why didn't you slap him?'

698
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,581
'You were scared, weren't you?'

699
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,332
Subedar was here last evening.

700
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,298
To ask for Kaanchi's hand in marriage for Binda.

701
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,100
And he wants to get them married this month.

702
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:14,571
When the mango's falling in your lap..

703
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,134
...then what's the hesitation?

704
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,771
That's what I am saying, get them married.

705
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,308
Anyway, they are made for each other.

706
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,443
I don't see anyone else.

707
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,278
Why not ask Binda first?

708
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,280
I'll talk to him.

709
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:40,696
Early morning?

710
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,637
I couldn't sleep.

711
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,037
Why?

712
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:49,372
You know...
my family talk about us.

713
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,178
What?

714
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,613
About our marriage.

715
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,417
Will you marry me?

716
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,358
I am not crazy?

717
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:08,622
Why?

718
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:10,460
Am I so bad?

719
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,527
Look, Kaanchi.

720
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,592
You're not old enough to get married, neither am I?

721
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,562
You still need to grow up, mentally.

722
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:20,268
And I've to fight these devils to save Koshampa.

723
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,109
Our families have been seeing us together“

724
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,146
...since we were kids so..

725
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,283
Now...will you marry me or not?

726
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,346
No.

727
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,516
WhY Won't you?

728
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,187
I'll tell everyone that you kissed me.

729
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,230
Get lost, you're crazy.

730
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,390
You're a rascal.

731
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,297
And if you say no now..

732
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,233
...then I'll tell the entire village“

733
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,704
“that you kissed me.

734
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,435
And you also did what's forbidden before marriage.

735
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,774
Now...are you scared.

736
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:02,546
If you scream at the top of your voice..

737
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,610
“And tell everyone what I did with you..

738
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,990
...still I won't marry you.

739
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,184
Now go, get lost.

740
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:14,994
Fine, don't do it.

741
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,028
Go and die. And I'll die too.

742
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,692
I'll jump to my death.

743
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:23,164
Rascal, who do you think you are?

744
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,558
Now go tell your family..

745
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,063
“That I did what's forbidden before marriage.

746
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:54,464
And...they can put this noose around my neck.

747
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,629
Noose?

748
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,136
Yes .

749
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,040
So why do you talk about dying?

750
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,577
Everyone knows that I was born for you..

751
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,445
“And I will die for you.

752
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,078
"Beloved."

753
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:12,586
Do I have to say "Love you" in English?

754
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:25,661
"Stay in my sights."

755
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:35,667
I see. I was born for you and I will die for you.

756
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,401
Good luck.

757
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:43,210
"My life-my heart."

758
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,319
Shushant, look.

759
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,025
Hello. Kaanchi.

760
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,132
Come on, Seema.

761
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,639
I don't want to talk to this rascal.

762
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,199
He's not Kakda, they are 'Kekde' (crabs).

763
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:13,977
Sorry my friend.

764
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,284
Kaanchi.

765
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,252
I want to talk to you.

766
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,158
I don't want to talk to you.

767
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,599
Listen to me, Kaanchi.

768
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,363
- Go away.
- Kaanchi.

769
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:10,428
- Where are you going inside?
- Kaanchi.

770
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,971
Kaanchi.

771
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,974
Sir, this is not your father's house.

772
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,639
This is Kaanchi's house.

773
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:22,608
Sir.

774
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,708
<i>You hawk,“</i>

775
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,986
Leave him.
Leave him, Siddhu.

776
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,563
Go leave.

777
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,006
We're kids of soldiers.

778
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,632
Don't mess with us.

779
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,458
What's his name?

780
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:09,995
Binda.

781
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,292
Binda.

782
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:20,702
Kids of the dishonest and rich have one problem.

783
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,104
As soon they grow up..

784
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:27,372
...they think they're rich and powerful.

785
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:29,716
Bad.

786
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,481
It's very, very bad..

787
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:37,248
“That he loved your girlfriend.

788
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,496
But what to do?

789
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,430
I am a father.

790
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,393
I'll have to support him in this battle of love.

791
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,196
You're right, sir.

792
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,132
I am right too.

793
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:56,100
And if a war's meant to be, then so be it, sir.

794
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,440
Do you know what war means?

795
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,039
What nonsense.

796
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,049
Sir, even I've read history.

797
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,982
And anyway, the girl's issue is a short story.

798
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,258
The real issue is Koshampa.

799
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,910
The government has already passed verdict on Koshampa.

800
00:49:11,936 --> 00:49:12,342
What else?

801
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,521
You're the one who controls the government.

802
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,723
You, you and you.

803
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:20,228
I am really pleased to meet you.

804
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:25,339
Every common man of India should be like you..

805
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,575
“That was Gandhiji's dream.

806
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,708
Sir, every resident of this village is exactly like that.

807
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,176
But you can't see it through those glasses.

808
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,146
That's true.

809
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:41,077
The storm sometimes doesn't see the lamps.

810
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,525
That's a nice dialogue.

811
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,356
We'll use it in some meeting.

812
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,622
Go, son.

813
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,498
Bless you. Go.

814
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,108
Blessings?

815
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,336
Brother thinks he's Sai Baba.

816
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,706
Blessings?

817
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:05,303
He just gave blessings and let him go.

818
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,746
Shoot those bloody ba****.

819
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,541
In all these years you didn't recognize Dada yet.

820
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,381
He always greets his enemies affectionately.

821
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,422
Because he never says what he thinks“

822
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,151
“and never thinks what he says.

823
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,250
I say what I think.

824
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,226
That's why you're not a politician.

825
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,354
You see Dada is far-sighted.

826
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:26,500
And we cannot lose Koshampa for one Shashank.

827
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,796
Ia-

828
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,570
Brilliant.

829
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,263
Brilliant.

830
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,339
We came here to do business, rascal..

831
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,540
Not a love-story. Music please.

832
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,051
Burn me if you can.

833
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,284
I am not worried about getting burned

834
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,493
In every aspect, in every way..

835
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:56,393
...l am waiting to make you mine.

836
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:58,691

I see no light on your face.

I can see fused bulb, son.

882
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,357
What's the problem, my dear?

883
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,293
He's deeply in love, sir.

884
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,261
But she's getting married to Binda.

885
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,378
So break it off.

886
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,791
What's the problem?

887
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,327
You can commit a number of crimes, no worries.

888
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:31,445
We're behind you.

889
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:33,160
Don't worry!

890
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,585
Such a strong boy, going weak.

891
00:55:36,611 --> 00:55:37,804
Shameful.

892
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,116
Where were you?

893
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,745
- To the city.
- Why?

894
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,421
Sherwani (Traditional attire).

895
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,688
Before your marriage?

896
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,425
I am only going to show-off today.

897
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,234

But Kaanchi always does what isn't allowed.

905
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,416
That's the fun.

906
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,487
No one knows we're here.

907
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,591
Let's runaway, get married.

908
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,625
That will be great fun, isn't it?

909
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,720
Yes, great fun.

910
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,464
Now give me a pose.

911
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,330
Look, I am going down, you stay here.

912
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,231
Stay there.

913
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,768
Wow, sweetheart.

914
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,767
Something filmy.

915
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:44,777
A bit to the left.

916
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,014
How am I looking?

917
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,177
Honestly...first time you're looking so beautiful.

918
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,084
You want to know a truth too.

919
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:56,215
For the first time you can see clearly.

920
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,986
- Can I say an old dialogue?
- What?

921
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,996
I love you, Kaanchi.

922
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,197
Always stay like this.

923
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:17,108
Binda.

924
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:19,177
Binda.

925
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,211
Binda. Binda.

926
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:20,762
Binda.

927
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,309
Binda, look at me.

928
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,045
Binda, look at me.

929
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,177
Get up.

930
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,345
Binda, look at me.

931
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,252
Binda.

932
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,195
Binda.

933
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,514
Fight.

934
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:31,208
Stop.

935
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,500
JB uncle...

936
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,272
...l killed him.

937
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,643
What did you say?

938
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:15,721
I killed him.

Get a receipt from Koshampa Valley Toll-booth“

- Yes.

966

Mr. Gupta.

967
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:53,093
Talk to him, and you talk to the police.

968
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:54,357
Yes .

969

Yes, sir.

Binda!

Can't you hear?

994
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:39,592
I am calling you.

995
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,267
Binda.

996
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,675
Binda!

997
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:59,291
Suraj Chauhan has lost his mind.

998
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,062
I just met all the villagers.

999
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,295
No one has the courage“

1000
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:07,493
...to stand against the law and government.

1001
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:10,534
Everyone's scared...

1002
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,503
...of Kakda and his government.

1003
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,487
Let's go home, dear.

1004
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,357
What happened has happened.

1005
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:42,694
I've serving in the police force for 40 years.

1006
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,332
I've just two words to tell you.

1007
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:46,706
Forget everything.

1008
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:51,701
We should be used to accepting injustice as destiny.

1009
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:57,107
Powerful people like Kakda run this country, not us.

1010
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,113
We're weak.

1011
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:00,448
And that's how we should be.

1012
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:03,116
We're fools, and we should remain fools.

1013
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:08,656
Everyone knows about Binda's murder.

1014
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:14,701
But in Bhagwafis FIR it's been termed as an accident.

1015
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,502
What can you do?

1016
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,763
And what can we do?

1017
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,300
Forget it.

1018
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:23,301
Forget it.

1019
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:03,242
I've written that his death was an accident.

1020
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:06,253
And this record is proof.

1021
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,250
Don't stare at me.

1022
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:18,664
If you have the courage, then fight with the Kakda family.

1023
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,277
What are you doing?

1024
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,779
Take that and that.

1025
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,120
Take that.

1026
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,328
Rascal..

1027
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,363
Corrupt.

1028
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,091
You dare make a false report.

1029
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,692
Rascal..

1030
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,665
Kaanchi.

1031
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,236
Get up rascal.

1032
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,137
Kaanchi, what are you doing?

1033
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:01,334
Rascal.

1034
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:05,209
She assaulted a government servant.

1035
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:08,215
I will burn this police station down to ashes.

1036
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,308
I will burn you alive here.

1037
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,114
Let me go.

1038
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,140
Who do you think you are?

1039
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:14,276
Leave me.

1040
01:05:14,302 --> 01:05:15,646
Let me go.

1041
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,026
Enough!

1042
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,487
Who else are you going to kill?

1043
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,130
First you destroyed him..

1044
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,098
...now you want to destroy the village.

1045
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:28,327
You want to fight them.

1046
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,371
You want to fight the law.
No.

1047
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,673
I won't let you do what you're thinking, Kaanchi.

1048
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,230
I will.

1049
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,306
I will do as I want.

1050
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,067
- Kaanchi.
- Move aside.

1051
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:40,637
- For my sake, Kaanchi.
- No oaths.

1052
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:45,145
You're used to living like insects, but not me.

1053
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:48,116
You want peace, but not me.

1054
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:51,452
I don't want to live with you cowards..

1055
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:54,723
- ..Who want to forget the truth.
- Kaanchi.

1056
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,195
I won't forget it.

1057
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,590
I will die but never forget it.

1058
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,657
I won't forget it.

1059
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,961
<i>L</i> am going!

1060
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:05,201
Don't try to find me.

1061
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:05,967
Kaanchi.

1062
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,072
Kaanchi.

1063
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,199
Kaanchi stop.

1064
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,275
Kaanchi!

1065
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,970
Kaanchi!

1066
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,684
Kaanchi!

1067
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,243
Kaanchi!

1068
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,719
Kaanchi, stop!

1069
01:06:56,311 --> 01:06:59,155
So Kaanchi...

1070
01:06:59,848 --> 01:07:01,384
...didn't die.

1071
01:07:06,388 --> 01:07:09,528
If she was dead, would I be sitting here, sir?

1072
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:14,070
With the bruises, the beating, the wounds..

1073
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:15,938
“The heartache.

1074
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:24,106
After that Kaanchi swam across the river..

1075
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:25,446
“And reached a village.

1076
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,453
From there she travelled to Katgodam, Dehradoon.

1077
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,423
And finally arrived in Mumbai.

1078
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,854
Well, I am sorry to break this news, son.

1079
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:11,292
Kaanchi leaped to her death and committed suicide.

1080
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:14,066
It's not good for us.

1081
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:30,377
She kept wandering around for 12 days“

1082
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,385
...on a empty stomach.

1083
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,647
Looking for whom?

1084
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,114
Me, sir.

1085
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,655
She didn't know anyone else here.

1086
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:38,414
- No one.
- Why?

1087
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:40,824
We were childhood friends.

1088
01:08:40,882 --> 01:08:42,293
She was looking for my address.

1089
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,225

Same place where there's theft, robbery, girls and booze.

1098

Rascal.
It's me Kaanchi.

1154
01:11:57,412 --> 01:11:59,414
So you've come to Mumbai...

1155
01:12:00,348 --> 01:12:01,452
...to try your luck.

1156
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:03,257
To be successful.

1157
01:12:04,252 --> 01:12:05,322
Quickly.

1158
01:12:05,453 --> 01:12:06,523
Short-time.

1159
01:12:08,323 --> 01:12:09,893
Great.

1160
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:11,929
Doing great.

1161
01:12:12,894 --> 01:12:15,067
I've been rotting here for 7 years.

1162
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,235
But I am still an insect in this city.

1163
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:18,977
Listen to me carefully.

1164
01:12:19,003 --> 01:12:19,902
No means no.

1165
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,148
I don't have a place for you.

1166
01:12:22,437 --> 01:12:25,008
Fine. I'll leave.

1167
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,052
I'll sleep on the streets.

1168
01:12:28,176 --> 01:12:29,951
Starve to death.

1169
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,019
But I will stay here.

1170
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,184
I'll return home only when I am successful..

1171
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:35,023
...when I've done something.

1172
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:39,962
Determination.

1173
01:12:41,823 --> 01:12:43,200
I understand...

1174
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:46,300
...what you want to be.

1175
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:49,103
Katrina Ka if.

1176
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:54,946
Come on, I'll make you Katrina Kaif.

1177
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:01,585
See that?

1178
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:06,483
VT Station.

1179
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:08,086
Keep this.

1180
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:10,555
3000, keep it.

1181
01:13:11,486 --> 01:13:14,933
Buy a ticket and head back home.

1182
01:13:15,123 --> 01:13:16,397
Get it?

1183
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:18,098
Bye .

1184
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:25,443
Come on India!

1185
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,945

...in the day too.

1195
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:52,838
Hail Bajrang“

1196
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,334
Tea.

1197
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:59,106
Sir, someone from the inquiry commission's here.

1198
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,341
Can I call you back?

1199
01:14:01,436 --> 01:14:02,847
Jai Hind, sir.

1200
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,383
What are you doing here?

1201
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:08,148
Aren't you ashamed?

1202
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:10,584
You threw a helpless girl from our village“

1203
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:12,415
“out of our house.

1204
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,017
She's my friend Teji's daughter.

1205
01:14:15,383 --> 01:14:19,092
She's looking for a job, like you did one day.

1206
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:23,093
Kaanchi will stay here, with me.

1207
01:14:24,192 --> 01:14:26,035
Come, Kaanchi.

1208
01:14:29,197 --> 01:14:31,404
'I was shocked by her intelligence.'

1209
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,169
'And what do I see next morning?'

1210
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,446
So you convinced mother?

1211
01:14:44,312 --> 01:14:46,815
You've grown very smart, Kaanchi.

1212
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:50,358
Now get up, today is a Sunday.

1213
01:14:51,986 --> 01:14:53,465
I want to see Mumbai.

1214
01:14:53,855 --> 01:14:56,301
"You're like a taxi."

1215
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,065
I really am like a taxi.

1216
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,970
You've become really naughty in Mumbai, Bagula.

1217
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,236
Those who decide to come and die in Mumbai..

1218
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:05,505
...Mumbai belongs to him.
Get it?

1219
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:09,041
A city of big people, big stars.

1220
01:15:09,871 --> 01:15:11,942
Do you know Kakda?

1221
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:14,114
Do you know Kakda?

1222
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:16,588
How do you know him?

1223
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:20,822
They're building a city in Koshampa.

1224
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:24,129
Kakda. Tremendous power.

1225
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,497
I'm one of his important men.

1226
01:15:28,089 --> 01:15:33,368
"Don't forget the childhood love."

1227
01:15:33,461 --> 01:15:35,441
You haven't changed.

1228
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,208
Better, Kaanchi.

1229
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:40,944
Much-much better.

1230
01:15:43,204 --> 01:15:44,410
Sigdi.

1231
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,950
My name's Sigdi.

1232
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:50,022
Did you forget?

1233
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:52,318
My childhood name is Sigdi.

1234
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:54,456
And I like it too.

1235
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,491
Listen, get me a job with the Kakda's.

1236
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,896
Don't you like me wearing these good clothes?

1237
01:16:02,957 --> 01:16:04,265
Why?

1238
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,565
Impossible.

1239
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,033
My job's still safe, and that's what matters.

1240
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,370
Drink the cola and watch the sights.

1241
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:19,045
I refused to get her a job at Shyam Kakda's house.

1242
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,547
Believe me, sir.

1243
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:25,087
She stood outside Shyam Kakda's house for 12 days.

1244
01:16:25,146 --> 01:16:27,387
To see who goes in, and who goes out.

1245
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:42,470
And she started identifying every person going in or out.

1246
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:49,938
And you know what she did one day?

1247
01:16:50,004 --> 01:16:53,542
She made Shyam Kakda's housekeeper, Maya, her target.

1248
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:33,551
Where are you from?

1249
01:17:34,115 --> 01:17:35,287
Uttranchal.

1250
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,023
What do you do?

1251
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,396
I am looking for a job.

1252
01:17:40,021 --> 01:17:42,467
Anything, small household chores.

1253
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:47,867
Maya sister, Vidya from our staff is on a month's leave.

1254
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,374
So appoint her instead.

1255
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:51,171
She looks poor.

1256
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:54,842
I don'tjust look poor, I am.

1257
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:57,005
What's your name?

1258
01:17:57,972 --> 01:17:59,417
- Sigdi.
- What?

1259
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:00,544
Sigdi.

1260
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:03,222
Do you know anyone here?

1261
01:18:03,878 --> 01:18:04,618
No.

1262
01:18:04,879 --> 01:18:06,483
No one?

1263
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:09,358
Yes. I knowjust one person.

1264
01:18:13,354 --> 01:18:16,528
Dada, <i>C</i> news' report on the exit polls is..

1265
01:18:16,591 --> 01:18:18,502
...that Satyakam and the youth party..

1266
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,005
...are getting stronger.

1267
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,099
They are the only obstructions in our polls..

1268
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,906
“And there's nothing else to worry about.

1269
01:18:30,104 --> 01:18:32,209
Dada, the situation is serious.

1270
01:18:32,273 --> 01:18:33,616
We'll have to do something.

1271
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:36,947
Bagula, what's the news?

1272
01:18:37,278 --> 01:18:41,852
Sir, Satyakam has been talking rubbish in the media.

1273
01:18:42,116 --> 01:18:43,459
You know him.

1274
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:45,122
He's your friend, isn't he?

1275
01:18:45,186 --> 01:18:46,893
Not actually.

1276
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:49,935
- Vedant.
- Yes.

1277
01:18:50,224 --> 01:18:51,464
Call him.

1278
01:18:54,929 --> 01:18:56,306
- And this“
- Hold on.

1279
01:19:00,468 --> 01:19:02,175
Hello, sir, Satyakam speaking.

1280
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,364
Yes, this is Vedant speaking.

1281
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,332
On behalf of Shyam sir.

1282
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:07,148
Why, can't Dada talk to me?

1283
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:09,983
Look, Satyakam, just your name's Satyakam“

1284
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,019
“but you're no honest person.

1285
01:19:12,246 --> 01:19:15,284
Brother has served the country for 50 years.

1286
01:19:16,317 --> 01:19:18,422
No, he's scavenged the country for 50 years.

1287
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:21,625
The youth are really angry, sir.

1288
01:19:22,256 --> 01:19:24,862
And they're prepared to uproot you.

1289
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:36,438
Satyakam, I comply with all your thoughts.

1290
01:19:37,271 --> 01:19:40,081
These discussions are just an exchange of words.

1291
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:42,948
You move ahead, we're behind you.

1292
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:45,891
God bless you my son.

1293
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:48,320
He hung up.

1294
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,355
Satya, it's not easy to expose Shyam Kakda.

1295
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,822
It's not difficult either.

1296
01:19:55,089 --> 01:19:58,036
One day we'll definitely expose his lie.

1297
01:19:58,226 --> 01:19:59,899
What's this?

1298
01:20:00,161 --> 01:20:01,572
Didn't you hear?

1299
01:20:01,829 --> 01:20:08,906
I said "You move ahead, I am...right behind you".

1300
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,543
Tell me Delhi's schedule, Savita.

1301
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:17,555
The media's been favoring Satyakam because..

1302
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:18,955
“They keep giving them secrets“

1303
01:20:19,013 --> 01:20:20,151
“through RTI or different contacts.

1304
01:20:20,214 --> 01:20:23,024
We'll have to do something.

1305
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,132
Even I shouted slogans when I was young.

1306
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:27,063
Let them.

1307
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:28,566
They'll calm down eventually.

1308
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:30,330
But what about the media?

1309
01:20:30,391 --> 01:20:32,997
The media's job is to shout.

1310
01:20:33,594 --> 01:20:36,336
Event to event, person to person.

1311
01:20:36,397 --> 01:20:38,070
They want to raise TRP.

1312
01:20:38,132 --> 01:20:40,112
When we do an event, our TRP soars.

1313
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:42,170
When they show the event, their TRP soars.

1314
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:00,895
Bagula.
What are you looking around for?

1315
01:21:00,955 --> 01:21:03,094
I've done your job.
Happy?

1316
01:21:03,157 --> 01:21:04,101
HaPPV?

1317
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:06,035
What are you staring at?

1318
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,537
On your reference I appointed Sigdi“

1319
01:21:07,595 --> 01:21:10,166
...in Vidya's place for a month.

1320
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:14,436
Right, right, right.

1321
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:16,582
- Can I meet her?
- No.

1322
01:21:16,904 --> 01:21:18,440
Is this house?

1323
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,851
Now you've to do my son Ritesh's job.

1324
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:24,048
Get it?

1325
01:21:34,922 --> 01:21:38,392
Those who come to Mumbai and decide to die..

1326
01:21:38,459 --> 01:21:40,336
...Mumbai belongs to him.

1327
01:21:42,263 --> 01:21:44,106
Thank you, Bagula.

1328
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:48,841
"Kaanchi."

1329
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:52,509
"Kaanchi."

1330
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:02,255
What did you say her name was?

1331
01:22:02,316 --> 01:22:04,489
Sigdi.
Reference, Maya.

1332
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,431
Thank God you're here.

1333
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:11,527
Otherwise I've to do all this alone.

1334
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:14,130
You don't know...

1335
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:19,269
...the Kakda family are a big scoundrel..

1336
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:20,539
Who else lives here?

1337
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:23,415
JUSt the senior master.

1338
01:22:24,305 --> 01:22:27,309
Public meetings during day.

1339
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:30,322
Private meetings at night.

1340
01:22:31,879 --> 01:22:34,120
He has a son too.

1341
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:35,590
Yes, he does.

1342
01:22:35,983 --> 01:22:37,485
Shushant.

1343
01:22:37,985 --> 01:22:42,229
He's insane, completely mad.

1344
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,963
Scoundrel.

1345
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,471
Thank God he's gone to Dubai for a month.

1346
01:22:46,527 --> 01:22:48,905
They've a big house out there.

1347
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,176
Kaanchi has committed suicide.

1348
01:22:59,173 --> 01:23:03,883
I am sorry, but you were too obsessed with that girl.

1349
01:23:04,478 --> 01:23:07,391
I am sure someone will definitely come from there.

1350
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:09,328
To destroy you.

1351
01:23:11,018 --> 01:23:11,962
Who?

1352
01:23:12,353 --> 01:23:14,424
Some youngster from Koshampa.

1353
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:20,338
Shake hands.

1354
01:23:21,996 --> 01:23:23,475
What are you doing?

1355
01:23:23,865 --> 01:23:25,139
Shushant.

1356
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,837
I am Kakda, you know that.

1357
01:23:29,136 --> 01:23:30,308
Kakda.

1358
01:23:31,138 --> 01:23:32,845
So just chill.

1359
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,164
Who else do you have here?

1360
01:23:45,219 --> 01:23:46,994
I have a brother. Sudhir.

1361
01:23:47,054 --> 01:23:51,025
He's a party worker with Sanjay Pathar.

1362
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:55,540
I had a mother.

1363
01:23:57,031 --> 01:23:59,033
But she passed away last year.

1364
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:02,242
Do you have a mother?

1365
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:05,006
- Yes, I do.
- Where?

1366
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:06,343
In the village.

1367
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:11,253
I really miss my mother.

1368
01:24:12,513 --> 01:24:13,958
Don't you.

1369
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:18,054
That's how mothers are.

1370
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:22,463
She yells, beats us, then she cries..

1371
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:26,369
“And then feeds us.

1372
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:05,377
'For 25 days she waited for Shushant.'

1373
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,412
'But he didn't come.'

1374
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:16,216
You look sexy in this hairstyle.

1375
01:25:17,478 --> 01:25:21,153
I like the way you call me sexy, Savita.

1376
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,838
Did you see anything?

1377
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:44,474
Yes .

1378
01:25:44,538 --> 01:25:48,418
Savita was combing your hair.

1379
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:53,186
And you were kissing“

1380
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:58,091
What you saw...

1381
01:25:58,886 --> 01:26:01,059
...you did not see.

1382
01:26:01,522 --> 01:26:06,904
And if you tell anyone what you saw.

1383
01:26:07,561 --> 01:26:12,271
Then you won't be able to see yourself tomorrow.

1384
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,850
Sweet girl.

1385
01:26:21,909 --> 01:26:23,445
Go.

1386
01:26:25,946 --> 01:26:27,050
Sir.

1387
01:26:27,114 --> 01:26:29,151
Jhoomar sir's call for you.

1388
01:26:30,117 --> 01:26:32,028
Yes, Jhooma r.

1389
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:34,259
What did you see?

1390
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:45,508
What you saw...you did not see.

1391
01:26:45,566 --> 01:26:47,375
Get that?

1392
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:49,242
Good girl.

1393
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:55,120
"Kaanchi."

1394
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:02,460
There's a powerful failure outside the bungalow.

1395
01:27:02,516 --> 01:27:04,120
Call Dhanraj.

1396
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:08,867
Where's Sigdi?

1397
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:10,402
She's gone to call her aunt.

1398
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:11,937
I see.

1399
01:27:17,231 --> 01:27:18,869
The electrician's here.

1400
01:27:18,933 --> 01:27:20,378
We'll have power back on in a while.

1401
01:27:20,434 --> 01:27:21,879
Sir's sleeping inside.

1402
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:23,506
Don't disturb him.

1403
01:28:48,055 --> 01:28:50,467
My brother Sanjay called.

1404
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:53,129
He was asking when is Shyam Dada..

1405
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:55,605
“Getting you a MLA ticket?

1406
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:57,407
I said I don't know.

1407
01:28:57,464 --> 01:29:01,310
I know your aspirations of becoming a minister.

1408
01:29:01,368 --> 01:29:03,473
I've been with you for 9 years.

1409
01:29:03,537 --> 01:29:06,108
I gave you everything.

1410
01:29:06,373 --> 01:29:09,115
That's why I am with you too.

1411
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,218
Forget it.

1412
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:15,624
We should talk about public matters in a private room.

1413
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:21,227
Make love, with a system.

1414
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:24,961
You and your system.

1415
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:27,301
I love you...Savita.

1416
01:29:31,232 --> 01:29:32,870
Siam!

1417
01:29:45,412 --> 01:29:46,982
Call her.

1418
01:29:47,047 --> 01:29:48,287
Yes .

1419
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:56,432
She hung up.

1420
01:30:02,329 --> 01:30:05,936
Mohanlal, open that door.

1421
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:10,381
I hope you remember, tomorrow“

1422
01:30:10,437 --> 01:30:14,886
...is my brother's musical night at Mustaq lttarwala's bungalow.

1423
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:17,218
You will have to come as my guest.

1424
01:30:17,244 --> 01:30:18,917
Savita, you know.

1425
01:30:18,943 --> 01:30:22,582
I've to attend Godrej's Holi party.

1426
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:26,364
You won't go there.

1427
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,236
Is that a threat?

1428
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:35,332
Yes, it is.

1429
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:38,933
If you don't come...

1430
01:30:41,435 --> 01:30:43,506
...then I'll have to request“

1431
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:45,106
“Satyakam to come there.

1432
01:30:52,813 --> 01:30:54,451
<i>Then...</i>

1433
01:30:55,182 --> 01:30:57,253
...you will have to join his party.

1434
01:30:57,384 --> 01:30:59,125
Maybe.

1435
01:30:59,586 --> 01:31:03,363
You'll have to tell him my secrets.

1436
01:31:04,558 --> 01:31:06,435
You said...

1437
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,507
...anything's possible in politics.

1438
01:31:12,032 --> 01:31:13,477
Savita.

1439
01:31:16,003 --> 01:31:17,846
You're my confidante.

1440
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:20,474
Yes, I am loyal.

1441
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:24,487
Swiss Banks, millions in scams.

1442
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:28,156
That boy's murder in Koshampa Valley..

1443
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:30,489

If a VIP guest winks at us, what should we do?

1619
01:42:36,549 --> 01:42:38,222
Good question.

1620
01:42:38,385 --> 01:42:40,888
Then you should wink back.

1621
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:44,029
Shouldn't we slap him?

1622
01:42:44,090 --> 01:42:47,094
Sigdi, do you know who you're talking to?

1623
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,106
It's alright.
It's alright.

- Sorry sir if I've offended you.
- No, no, no.

1629
01:43:02,442 --> 01:43:06,015
You should always speak what's in your heart.

1630
01:43:06,146 --> 01:43:08,820
Before you ruin my party.

1631
01:43:08,882 --> 01:43:09,621

Anointment.

1647
01:44:02,068 --> 01:44:04,514
No one anoints the host.

1648
01:44:04,571 --> 01:44:07,484
I did it only because you said so.

1649
01:44:07,874 --> 01:44:10,480
Such a sweet girl.

1650
01:44:12,045 --> 01:44:13,183
Shall we?

1651
01:44:13,246 --> 01:44:14,452
Come on.

1652
01:44:20,453 --> 01:44:22,933

Some scoundrel...has sent it.

1675
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:17,381
Take it.

01:53:29,502 --> 01:53:32,506
Few people saw him run after a girl.

You've to find a girl.

1833
01:53:49,288 --> 01:53:50,494
Who?

1834
01:53:50,556 --> 01:53:53,435
The girl that ran with Nattu.

1835
01:53:53,492 --> 01:53:55,130
Done, sir.

1836
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:56,162

We need to make this night special.

1844
01:54:12,078 --> 01:54:13,284
Sweet hart.

1845
01:54:13,979 --> 01:54:15,515
Can I drink some water?

1846
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:19,827
- Go.
- Be right back.

1847
01:54:20,519 --> 01:54:23,989
Go. Go. Go.

1848
01:55:00,793 --> 01:55:03,171
Love you, Sigdi.

1849
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:32,097
My husband unconscious, but I am still conscious.

1850
01:55:33,325 --> 01:55:35,066
He's gone mad.

1851
01:55:36,896 --> 01:55:39,809
But youmlittle girl“

1852
01:55:40,032 --> 01:55:42,239
If you value your life, then“

1853
01:55:42,301 --> 01:55:44,781
“get out of this house in 3 minutes.

1854
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:47,143
And don't even dream about this man.

1855
01:55:47,339 --> 01:55:50,320
Just save your life and get out.

1856
01:55:50,876 --> 01:55:52,014
Get out!

1857
01:55:59,018 --> 01:56:01,430
God favors the brave.

1858
01:56:03,789 --> 01:56:05,496
Mission JB successful.

1859
01:56:06,926 --> 01:56:10,806
But a bad news was waiting ahead.

1860
01:56:14,066 --> 01:56:16,512
The entire city's under a shock..

1861
01:56:16,569 --> 01:56:18,276
...because Shyam Kakda's secretary“

1862
01:56:18,337 --> 01:56:21,181
“Savita Pathare died in a bomb blast yesterday.

1863
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:23,151
Who and how this bomb blast took place..

1864
01:56:23,209 --> 01:56:25,917
...the government has no answer.

1865
01:56:26,111 --> 01:56:28,022
Shyam Kakda's personal secretary Savita Pathare“

1866
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:31,289
...who was present here during the incident“

1867
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:32,954
...fell prey to the bomb blast.

1868
01:56:33,018 --> 01:56:35,396
Home Minister's secretary JB Godbole has stated that..

1869
01:56:35,454 --> 01:56:37,229
...terrorist from the neighboring country..

1870
01:56:37,256 --> 01:56:38,860
...can be behind this bomb blast.

1871
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:40,596
And an enquiry commission has been appointed.

1872
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:42,066
This is women killing.

1873
01:56:42,161 --> 01:56:44,038
Sister Savita was very nice woman.

1874
01:56:44,096 --> 01:56:46,576
Savita Pathare was supposed to get the MLA ticket.

1875
01:56:46,832 --> 01:56:50,211
But unfortunately, she fell prey along with 4 other people.

1876
01:56:50,269 --> 01:56:52,180
This is Jananta, Zee News.

1877
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:56,448
Savita's death isn't just a loss to the country“

1878
01:56:56,508 --> 01:56:59,114
“but for me too.

1879
01:56:59,278 --> 01:57:01,417
Savita was the daughter of this country.

1880
01:57:02,014 --> 01:57:03,357
She was a rising youth.

1881
01:57:03,415 --> 01:57:05,122
She was the future.

1882
01:57:05,517 --> 01:57:08,157
May God give peace to Savita's soul.

1883
01:57:08,220 --> 01:57:09,494
Hello.

1884
01:57:10,155 --> 01:57:11,225
Can I speak to Manjari?

1885
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:14,567
The rival country hasn't done a good thing“

1886
01:57:14,627 --> 01:57:16,231
...by killing her.

1887
01:57:16,328 --> 01:57:19,901
The enemy should know our strength.

1888
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:25,173
Those rascal terrorists killed sister Savita.

1889
01:57:25,237 --> 01:57:27,376
That's why I was calling you.

1890
01:57:28,641 --> 01:57:30,643
I lost my phone.

1891
01:57:32,044 --> 01:57:33,022
Lost.

1892
01:57:33,078 --> 01:57:35,217
Hold on.

1893
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:37,188
I found this phone in the garden.

1894
01:57:39,251 --> 01:57:41,026
This is my phone.

1895
01:57:41,954 --> 01:57:43,297
Come on India.

1896
01:57:43,355 --> 01:57:44,857
Come on India.

1897
01:57:44,924 --> 01:57:46,164
Come on India.

1898
01:57:46,225 --> 01:57:47,829
Come on India.

1899
01:57:47,893 --> 01:57:49,099
Come on India.

1900
01:57:49,161 --> 01:57:50,265
Come on India.

1901
01:57:50,329 --> 01:57:54,072
Where's that India that was better than the rest.

1902
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:19,267
We got it.

1903
01:58:19,491 --> 01:58:21,596
Not one, but two.

1904
01:58:23,329 --> 01:58:26,333
We politicians concentrate more on power..

1905
01:58:26,398 --> 01:58:29,208
“And less on doing our jobs.

1906
01:58:30,002 --> 01:58:34,007
We spend 70% of our time in party politics.

1907
01:58:34,039 --> 01:58:35,643
And do less development.

1908
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:37,319
The real leaders are those“

1909
01:58:37,376 --> 01:58:40,823
...who take the demands of the poor to the Parliament.

1910
01:58:45,417 --> 01:58:48,455
We'll have to erase Savita's name from our list.

1911
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:51,194
But with a system.

1912
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:56,304
Terrorists kill innocent people and leave.

1913
01:58:56,528 --> 01:59:00,908
When girls like Nirbhaya get raped my heart aches.

1914
01:59:03,135 --> 01:59:06,309
My heart aches seeing these poor people.

1915
01:59:09,074 --> 01:59:12,078
My heart aches when I see these kids.

1916
01:59:14,179 --> 01:59:17,490
Protection of women is my first responsibility.

1917
01:59:25,124 --> 01:59:27,968
What other responsibilities do you have?

1918
01:59:28,027 --> 01:59:29,938
Do tell us.

1919
01:59:30,095 --> 01:59:32,632
Shyam Kakda!

1920
01:59:50,215 --> 01:59:52,456
Calm down. Everyone calm down.

1921
01:59:52,518 --> 01:59:54,964
This is a game of the opposition party.

1922
01:59:57,589 --> 02:00:02,368
Look...Satyakam's party is..

1923
02:00:04,463 --> 02:00:06,136
I am standing right here.

1924
02:00:06,198 --> 02:00:08,303
And I will stand here.

1925
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:11,572
No one can budge me.

Come.

2153
02:13:57,295 --> 02:14:00,037
Where have you brought me?

2154
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:10,576
Thank you my friend.

2155
02:14:11,809 --> 02:14:13,811
There's 5 million in that bag.

2156
02:14:14,045 --> 02:14:17,288
You kept your promise, here's your reward.

2157
02:14:20,418 --> 02:14:21,522
Thank you, sir.

2158
02:14:21,586 --> 02:14:25,466
Forgive me for taking a peek.

2159
02:14:27,458 --> 02:14:29,404
Here's your memorabilia.

2160
02:14:30,561 --> 02:14:31,869
Can I go?

2161
02:14:32,463 --> 02:14:34,272
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

2162
02:14:40,371 --> 02:14:42,317
Thank you, sir.

2163
02:14:44,208 --> 02:14:46,449
Bagula. Rascal.

2164
02:14:46,511 --> 02:14:48,149
You betrayed me.

2165
02:14:48,212 --> 02:14:49,816
You dare sell me out.

2166
02:14:49,881 --> 02:14:52,088
I will kill you first.

2167
02:14:52,150 --> 02:14:53,390
Bagula.

2168
02:15:21,379 --> 02:15:22,585
Obsession.

2169
02:15:23,014 --> 02:15:25,585
Obsession.

2170
02:15:26,985 --> 02:15:29,022
After you left...

2171
02:15:29,253 --> 02:15:34,168
...l could see only your face in every painting.

2172
02:15:36,027 --> 02:15:37,904
Your gleam.

2173
02:15:39,530 --> 02:15:41,441
Your eyes.

2174
02:15:43,768 --> 02:15:45,406
These cheeks.

2175
02:15:47,905 --> 02:15:50,909
These lips.

2176
02:15:51,776 --> 02:15:53,551
I still love you.

2177
02:15:54,946 --> 02:15:57,426
I will make another painting of you.

2178
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:00,056
Naked.

2179
02:16:01,352 --> 02:16:02,558
Nude.

2180
02:16:23,508 --> 02:16:26,853
You can kill me if you want.

2181
02:16:27,245 --> 02:16:29,088
No so easily.

2182
02:16:31,082 --> 02:16:36,464
You should feel the same pain I did.

2183
02:16:38,156 --> 02:16:39,100
Look.

2184
02:16:41,426 --> 02:16:42,496
Look. Look.

2185
02:16:42,860 --> 02:16:43,565
Look.

2186
02:17:45,156 --> 02:17:47,966
Ba**** wrong timing.

2187
02:17:48,025 --> 02:17:49,595
Sir, this is not the way.

2188
02:17:49,861 --> 02:17:51,306
Out.

2189
02:17:51,596 --> 02:17:52,766
Sir, this isn't right.

2190
02:17:52,792 --> 02:17:54,067
Sigdi snatched my gun.

2191
02:17:54,098 --> 02:17:55,236
I am a police officer, sir.

2192
02:17:55,299 --> 02:17:57,108
- Out.
- This isn't right, sir.

2193
02:17:57,168 --> 02:17:58,909
You bring Kaanchi's sister home and don't tell me.

2194
02:17:58,970 --> 02:18:00,278
- This isn't right.
- Out.

2195
02:18:00,338 --> 02:18:02,477
This isn't right, sir, you're pointing a gun at me.

2196
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:04,186
I am your servant, your friend.

2197
02:18:04,212 --> 02:18:05,273
I am loyal to you.

2198
02:18:05,309 --> 02:18:07,016
And you're pointing a gun at me. At me.

2199
02:18:07,078 --> 02:18:09,319
There's just one way to show you.

2200
02:18:09,345 --> 02:18:11,449
And that is to kill you, sir.

2201
02:18:11,482 --> 02:18:13,359
Kaanchi, run away.

2202
02:18:13,417 --> 02:18:14,589
I'll deal with this rascal.

2203
02:18:15,453 --> 02:18:16,864
<i>"Jai He."</i>

02:18:21,058 --> 02:18:22,230

<i>"Jai He."</i>

2206
02:18:28,866 --> 02:18:31,870
Now watch my way.

2207
02:18:32,069 --> 02:18:34,879
Take this. And that.

2208
02:18:34,939 --> 02:18:37,078
And this.

2209
02:18:51,255 --> 02:18:52,256
Nini.

2210
02:18:52,423 --> 02:18:53,834
Nini.

2211
02:19:01,566 --> 02:19:03,273
Fight.

2212
02:22:06,484 --> 02:22:09,260
Kill me.

2213
02:22:10,855 --> 02:22:12,528
Kill me.

2214
02:22:35,212 --> 02:22:38,125
So where did Kaanchi go?

2215
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:42,489
To her village Koshampa.

2216
02:22:43,053 --> 02:22:44,532
With her mother.

2217
02:22:46,323 --> 02:22:47,893
Just like Kakda fled from Koshampa..

2218
02:22:47,992 --> 02:22:50,063
“Without leaving any evidence.

2219
02:22:50,227 --> 02:22:53,470
Similarly, Kaanchi returned to her village“

2220
02:22:53,531 --> 02:22:55,238
“without leaving any evidence.

2221
02:22:55,366 --> 02:22:59,143
You mean Kaanchi fled from the law.

2222
02:23:01,972 --> 02:23:04,316
One, two, three, four.

2223
02:23:04,375 --> 02:23:05,581
Come on, come on, jump.

2224
02:23:05,843 --> 02:23:07,113
Jump, come on.

2225
02:23:07,139 --> 02:23:09,315
One, two, three, four.

2226
02:23:09,413 --> 02:23:10,915
<i>Faster.</i>

2227
02:23:11,982 --> 02:23:17,523
"Stay in my sights."

2228
02:23:18,889 --> 02:23:25,499
"Stay in my sights."

2229
02:23:35,239 --> 02:23:36,013
Sir.

2230
02:23:42,012 --> 02:23:46,154
Is it true that you gave orders to close Kaanchi's file?

2231
02:23:46,417 --> 02:23:48,294
What do you think?

2232
02:23:48,886 --> 02:23:50,263
Who is right?

2233
02:23:50,554 --> 02:23:52,465
Kaanchi or Kakda.

2234
02:23:54,425 --> 02:23:56,962
Sir, there's tremendous pressure from the superiors.

2235
02:23:57,795 --> 02:23:59,274
I'm getting calls from Delhi.

2236
02:23:59,330 --> 02:24:01,503
- Let it ring.
- But, sir..

2237
02:24:01,866 --> 02:24:03,243
Leave it.

2238
02:24:07,171 --> 02:24:10,243
You do know Arindham Barua from Delhi Office.

2239
02:24:10,307 --> 02:24:11,411
'75 batch.

2240
02:24:11,475 --> 02:24:14,046
One day when he was drunk he told me that“

2241
02:24:14,111 --> 02:24:16,853
“the minister gave him his unnamed flat“

2242
02:24:16,914 --> 02:24:20,157
...to change two lines in his report.

2243
02:24:21,151 --> 02:24:23,961
More than 60% politician politicians“

2244
02:24:24,021 --> 02:24:28,970
...have amassed from 100 to 1000 crores in 10 years.

2245
02:24:29,426 --> 02:24:31,372
From system.

2246
02:24:33,163 --> 02:24:36,235
The law is sold outside the court.

2247
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:38,537
Deals are made with the media.

2248
02:24:39,136 --> 02:24:41,946
MLAs are bought and sold in party politics.

2249
02:24:42,006 --> 02:24:45,180
MPs are bought and sold.

2250
02:24:46,911 --> 02:24:49,448
Businessmen make the news laws of business.

2251
02:24:49,513 --> 02:24:50,491
Wow!

2252
02:24:51,815 --> 02:24:53,192
You do know that.

2253
02:24:53,250 --> 02:24:56,026
You, me, we all know it.

2254
02:24:56,387 --> 02:24:58,367
Yet, we keep quiet.

2255
02:24:58,923 --> 02:25:01,426
Because we're slaves of the system.

2256
02:25:02,059 --> 02:25:05,165
And these politicians make this system, control it..

2257
02:25:05,229 --> 02:25:06,970
“And break it too.

2258
02:25:09,266 --> 02:25:13,339
Corruption dwells in our blood, Gautam.

2259
02:25:15,406 --> 02:25:16,885
What a shame.

2260
02:25:17,041 --> 02:25:22,992
But Kaanchi's the new youth.

2261
02:25:23,447 --> 02:25:26,087
She gave a fitting reply to a power like Kakda..

2262
02:25:26,150 --> 02:25:28,187
...from her system.

2263
02:25:28,819 --> 02:25:32,130
And said...Fear no Evil.

2264
02:25:32,823 --> 02:25:36,066
And do what is right.

2265
02:25:39,229 --> 02:25:42,108
And that's why I closed Kaanchi's file.

2266
02:25:42,366 --> 02:25:45,040
And I know I'm doing the right thing.

2267
02:25:45,235 --> 02:25:47,408
Because I feel good.

2268
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:54,287
Kaanchi!

2269
02:25:54,445 --> 02:25:56,118
Kaanchi!

2270
02:25:56,313 --> 02:25:57,951
Kaanchi!

2271
02:25:58,082 --> 02:25:59,823

02:26:01,852 --> 02:26:03,331
Kaanchi!

2274
02:26:03,487 --> 02:26:05,194
Kaanchi!

2275
02:26:15,065 --> 02:26:16,100
You know, Kaanchi..

2276
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:18,077
“Both the Kakdas were sentenced to 15 years ofjail.

2277
02:26:18,135 --> 02:26:21,548
The court has also cancelled Kakda's project.

2278
02:26:21,805 --> 02:26:24,217
Koshampa's lands were returned too.

2279

With the grace of God.

2280
02:26:26,210 --> 02:26:27,120
Right.

2281
02:26:27,177 --> 02:26:29,020
You were furious for no reason and left us.
