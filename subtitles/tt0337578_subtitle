1
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:16,858
''Baghban - the one that
tends to his garden''

2
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:21,488
''And a father,
who starts a family''

3
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:29,495
''Both sweat and toil to make
their roses and wards thrive''

4
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,916
''The gardener loves
not just the trees in his garden...''

5
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,919
''he loves their shadow too''

6
00:01:37,586 --> 00:01:41,923
''For he hopes,
that one day...''

7
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,926
''when he's tired of life...''

8
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:48,346
''it is this very shade
that will prove useful for him''

9
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:06,946
''To the thirsting earth,
the clouds bring rains...''

10
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:11,909
''seasons come and go...''

11
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:24,921
''the fragrance of every season...''

12
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,967
''the gardener gifts
to his Eden''

13
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:37,974
''Every flower in the garden
is dear to the gardener...''

14
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,611
''he stands guard every moment,
on every leaf, every branch''

15
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:57,034
''ln the gardener
lives God''

16
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,656
Time for the morning walk...
c'mon!

17
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,995
Good morning!
Where are the others?

18
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:47,830
Fast asleep

19
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:51,667
''Wake up, O traveller.
Dawn has...''

20
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:55,337
l've been shouting and shouting.
Can't you walk a bit slowly?

21
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:58,256
''How are you, Ram Avtar...?''

22
00:03:58,757 --> 00:04:02,260
But you said you weren't in the habit
of waking up early

23
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:04,554
''Yes, l did.
But how can l help it...?''

24
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:06,681
The way you shout up
early in the morning...

25
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:09,892
you wake up the whole neighbourbood.
And l live right behind your house

26
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:11,977
''Oh yes, you do''

27
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:15,814
You are the one who has
given me the house on rent

28
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:18,442
The landlord. You can evict me
any time you wish to

29
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,819
''l'll vacate the house, if you insist.
- Now look...''

30
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:26,407
don't ruin my mood early in the day.
You call yourself my brother...

31
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,161
and now you play with my emotions?
Like hell you'll vacate the house!

32
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:32,454
''Of course!
One day, l'll vacate your house''

33
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,164
Let's see!

34
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:37,376
Sat Sri Akal!
- Sat Sri Akal

35
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:40,045
lt's time you found another excuse
to start a fight

36
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,714
l've been listening to it for
25 years and l'm bored stiff

37
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:45,091
''Am l wrong, Tito?''

38
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:48,094
Why do you take the donkey out
for a walk everyday?

39
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,972
What rubbish! Tito's not a donkey.
lt's a dog!

40
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:54,725
lt was your dog
l put the question to!

41
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,060
There! He had the last word!

42
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:00,063
''Never mind, Ram Avtar.
l'll fix our friend tomorrow''

43
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:33,385
So you're up!
- What can l do?

44
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:35,554
When you leave for the walk...

45
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:39,057
''l'm in such a deep sleep,
that l just can't open my eyes''

46
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:41,726
''Come here, Pooja''

47
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:44,771
Guess why l go for a walk.
- For good health

48
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:48,774
Not at all. l go for a walk
so that when l return...

49
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:53,153
l can see your smiling face
when l return. Sit down

50
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,406
''ln that case, you needn't worry.
This story shall forever continue''

51
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,951
So let's sweeten our tongue!
- l haven't brushed my teeth yet

52
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:02,579
As if tigresses brush their teeth!
Eat it up

53
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,749
No...
- Eat! Jalebis from Jhanguram!

54
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,752
You will never improve.
- Never!

55
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:16,758
Here you are.
- What am l going to do with it?

56
00:06:17,134 --> 00:06:19,469
Tie it.
- Do l know how to tie it?

57
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:23,348
You're a grown up man.
Why don't you learn it?

58
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,809
''lf l learn to tie it,
what happens of you?''

59
00:06:27,226 --> 00:06:29,770
You will never improve!
- Why must l?

60
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,064
Listen...

61
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,775
l keep it right in front of your eyes.
And you still forget it every day

62
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,110
l don't forget it.
l deliberately leave it there

63
00:06:37,235 --> 00:06:39,571
Why?
- Money from the Goddess of Wealth...

64
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:43,199
is always useful. May l go now?

65
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:46,452
''Come back soon.
- l'll stay back, if you insist''

66
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:48,829
You will never improve!

67
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:09,473
''Hello, Ram Sharan! Has your
grandson's fever subsided?''

68
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:11,600
''Yes, sir.
- Good''

69
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:15,479
He can just play with words
to flatter me

70
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:18,482
Couldn't he take a day off
from the office?

71
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,986
''But no, sir.
He can't see beyond his work''

72
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,825
''What's up, mister?
You look worried''

73
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:34,455
l've got to rush to the hospital
once l withdraw the money here

74
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,873
l've had my daughter-in-law
admitted in the labour ward

75
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,543
But no one here understands!
- Why must that upset you?

76
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,671
We have an ATM machine here.
You'll get the money immediately

77
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,173
Really?
- Yes

78
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,551
''To my loving husband''

79
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,886
''Who am l writing the ''loving'' for?''

80
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,889
lt's okay if he forgot it
in the morning

81
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,558
But he could've called
from the office

82
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:59,269
Let him return this evening.
l won't even talk to him

83
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:06,526
Our branch in Nainital can send a
bankers' cheque to the child's school

84
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,279
''Wow, Mr Malhotra!''

85
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:16,201
Everyone has it. But you are the one
who puts his brains to use

86
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:21,206
Take my advise and start
a business of your own

87
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,627
''Not a bad idea, sir.
But my problem is...''

88
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:29,880
l've got into the habit
of having a boss over me

89
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,549
You're the boss here.
And it's the wife at home

90
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:04,662
You! A magician!

91
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:07,748
''Before l can ring the bell,
you know it's me!''

92
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:10,668
Whether you ring the bell or not...

93
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,671
your footsteps ring a bell
in my heart

94
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:18,592
''Really? So let's...
- No, nothing today''

95
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:22,679
Why not?
- l'm angry with you

96
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,973
''Really? ln that case,
l'm angry with you too''

97
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:28,559
Why you?
- You tell me first

98
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:31,645
''lt's evening already,
and you haven't even wished me yet!''

99
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:35,357
Did you wish me then? How could
you forget this day?

100
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:38,402
''l forgot it...?
- Yes, you did''

101
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,987
l forgot it...?
And what's that?

102
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:43,740
''l've been cleaning up the house,
baking a cake for you and...''

103
00:09:46,784 --> 00:09:49,745
So you haven't forgotten?

104
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,374
Does anyone forget to breathe?

105
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,003
''Without you, Pooja...
l was just a living being''

106
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:02,006
My heart started beating only after
you come into my life

107
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:04,676
And this was the day
you came into my life

108
00:10:05,093 --> 00:10:07,303
''And this day, l shall
remember forever''

109
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:12,641
Congratulations on our
fortieth wedding anniversary

110
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:17,062
Fortieth! Don't be funny! l haven't
even looked at you properly yet!

111
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:22,484
Let me take a good look...
Wow! So beautiful!

112
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:28,990
Why don't you and l go out for
a candlelight dinner tonight?

113
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:34,078
''Champagne, roses...
you and l''

114
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:38,540
How about us?
- Hey! How did you get here?

115
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:40,834
What could we do?
You've forgotten...

116
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:43,378
that you have four sons and
three daughters-in-law

117
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,004
A grandson and a granddaughter too

118
00:10:45,213 --> 00:10:47,131
But Mr and Mrs Raj Malhotra
have set out...

119
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:48,633
for a candlelight dinner

120
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,676
Are you going to stand there
and talk? Come here

121
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:56,974
When did you arrive...?
We didn't even get to know

122
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,354
You there... come here!

123
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,481
''How could we miss your
40th anniversary, dad?''

124
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:10,486
Who else is left...?
Karan! Come here

125
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:13,781
l'm the youngest.
l was waiting for my turn

126
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:17,784
''Wrong, Uncle!
l'm the youngest in the family''

127
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:20,453
Come here!

128
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:23,706
Where's Payal...?

129
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,422
She's growing up to be
just like her mother!

130
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:36,843
Ajju bhaiyya got married early
like you. And he stands to gain

131
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:38,178
How?

132
00:11:38,553 --> 00:11:40,639
His daughter has grown up
before his hair has started graying!

133
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:43,641
Don't cast an evil eye
on our little girl

134
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:46,185
You kids have made us happy
by giving us a surprise today

135
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:50,481
''Your turn to make us happy by
giving us a small party, dad''

136
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:15,963
''Mr Bedi, they are...?''

137
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:19,591
They're the roses in
Mr Malhotra's garden

138
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,968
''This is Mr Rawal, our boss''

139
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,805
''That's son number one, Ajay.
Son number two Sanjay''

140
00:12:26,264 --> 00:12:29,183
''Son number three Rohit,
and son number four...''

141
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:33,020
That was a wrong introduction

142
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:39,901
''Whatever their names, these sons are
like Ram, Laxman, Bharat and Shatrughan''

143
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,237
That's very well said!

144
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:47,283
''But where's their father,
the King Dashrath ?''

145
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:00,253
What are you staring at?
Come and fasten it

146
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,963
Oh sure

147
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:09,929
''l was right, you know.
- What?''

148
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:12,389
You are indeed a magician

149
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:16,226
You know how to hold time
in your fist

150
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:21,231
Which is why you're still 20
and l'm already 60

151
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,445
lt isn't time. lt's your love
l have held in my fist

152
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:31,699
Love is the magic that
keeps you forever young

153
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:35,953
''ln that case, we're going
to be young all our lives''

154
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:39,956
''Ajay, go and see if the bride
and the bridegroom are ready''

155
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:45,628
''The newly-weds haven't left for their
honeymoon already, have they?''

156
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,633
Look at those smiles!

157
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,679
Congratulations

158
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:59,307
''To you too, sister-in-law''

159
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:02,977
lf we can follow the
traditions of the British...

160
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:05,897
''in honeymoons, birthdays
and anniversaries...''

161
00:14:06,355 --> 00:14:08,733
why don't we remember a
lovely little custom of theirs?

162
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,067
What custom?

163
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:13,153
ln which the bridegroom carries
his bride in his arms...

164
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,614
and crosses the threshold
of his house!

165
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:19,993
''That's a nice idea!
- That's a great idea, Rawal-saheb!''

166
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:22,996
''So carry your wife, Raj!''

167
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:28,292
Are you out of your mind...?
Look at Raj's age at least

168
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,628
What's wrong with my age?

169
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,674
''Raj, if you strain your waist,
you'll land in serious trouble''

170
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:39,094
You think l've grown old?
l've gone senile?

171
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,347
l'm still young enough.
Want me to carry her to prove it?

172
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,350
''C'mon, lady...''

173
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:47,018
where to?

174
00:14:47,393 --> 00:14:49,020
Hey beautiful one...

175
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:51,730
''well, all right.
Plan number two''

176
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:53,190
C'mon!

177
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:07,328
''My butterball,
my pretty lady...''

178
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:11,373
''my moonbeam''

179
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:44,445
''Your gait is so enticing...''

180
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,824
''you are amazing, O beautiful one''

181
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:03,421
''My pretty lady,
my beautiful one...''

182
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,050
''without you,
l would surely die''

183
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,021
''My handsome beloved...''

184
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:25,775
''yours is an amazing dance''

185
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:31,447
''My butterball,
my beautiful lady...''

186
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:33,866
''my moonbeam''

187
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:08,231
''A picture as lovely
as the Moon...''

188
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:13,027
''you are the most beautiful one''

189
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:17,823
''You are the one
l could die for...''

190
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:24,495
''you are the one
l need oh so much''

191
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:33,545
''You are my dream,
you are my destiny...''

192
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:36,882
''you are the Moon
among the stars''

193
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,760
''You are the one who puts
the stars to shade...''

194
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:47,517
''you are the most beautiful
of them all''

195
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:50,853
''O beloved...''

196
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:05,867
''Your gait is so enticing...''

197
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:10,830
''you are beyond compare,
O beautiful one''

198
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:15,542
''My handsome beloved...''

199
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,547
''yours is an amazing dance''

200
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:25,885
''My butterball,
my beautiful lady...''

201
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:27,929
''my moonbeam''

202
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:16,598
''My heart l lost
in finding my beloved''

203
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:20,935
''l was lost to myself
so l could have you''

204
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:26,274
''Your beauty it is
that lights up...''

205
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:31,862
''my humble abode''

206
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:41,413
''You are the one
l continue to breathe for''

207
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:44,916
''lt's you that keeps me young''

208
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,961
''ln your thick tresses...''

209
00:19:49,712 --> 00:19:55,676
''l find my heaven,
my life''

210
00:19:57,177 --> 00:20:00,013
''O beloved...''

211
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:13,942
''Your gait is so enticing...''

212
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:18,738
''you are amazing,
O beautiful one''

213
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,335
''My butterball,
my beautiful lady...''

214
00:20:33,877 --> 00:20:38,090
''without you, l'd die''

215
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:50,768
''My handsome beloved...''

216
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:56,148
''yours is an amazing dance''

217
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:36,990
''You are my father,
you are my mother...''

218
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:39,868
''you are my friend,
you are my confidante''

219
00:22:42,203 --> 00:22:43,538
Alok! My son!

220
00:22:43,705 --> 00:22:44,664
Alok!

221
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:47,542
''My respects, father.
- May you live a hundred years''

222
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:50,252
Talk to your mother.
She badly wants to talk to you

223
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:53,922
''Hello, mother. My respects''

224
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:58,969
l pray to God that you
keep smiling forever...

225
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:01,054
and forever be together

226
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:05,475
Your studies are over now.
When are you coming to lndia?

227
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,894
We miss you so much.
- l miss you all too

228
00:23:09,895 --> 00:23:12,398
''With your blessings, l've found
a very nice job here''

229
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:16,693
l'm trying to get a transfer to
lndia in a month or two

230
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:20,238
That's wonderful! Come back soon

231
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:23,658
We'll find a pretty girl
and get you married to her

232
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,537
Why're you laughing?
- l've found the girl already

233
00:23:28,996 --> 00:23:30,539
Found her...?

234
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:33,959
lt's for you to decide
whether she's pretty or not

235
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:37,337
So send us a photo quickly.
What's her name?

236
00:23:38,004 --> 00:23:40,966
l've sent the photographs.
You could receive it tomorrow

237
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:44,260
''Her name is Arpita, mother
- Lovely name''

238
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:45,636
''Thanks, mother.''

239
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:48,973
''Good bye, mother''

240
00:23:50,015 --> 00:23:53,977
l could at least muster the courage
to talk to mother and father

241
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:57,939
And what if your parents
don't approve of me?

242
00:23:58,315 --> 00:23:59,941
Will you still marry me?

243
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,905
They are the folks who picked
up an orphan from the streets...

244
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:10,451
and took him to the stage
where l stand today

245
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,370
''They're my Gods, Arpita''

246
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,541
lt's true that if they had
turned down this marriage...

247
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:21,378
l wouldn't have gone ahead with it.
lt's also true...

248
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,547
that l wouldn't ever have
married all my life

249
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:29,552
But l'd love you all my life.
l promise you

250
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,641
lt's just this trait of yours
that makes me love you so much

251
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,394
''Whether we get married or not,
l will always belong to you''

252
00:24:47,026 --> 00:24:49,028
The kids' arrival really
livened up things

253
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,697
You have given me
very lovable children

254
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:54,700
''l gave you the children, yes.
But it's you who made them lovable''

255
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:56,702
Have they gone to bed?
- Yes...

256
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:58,620
Anju and Karan are
sleeping in our room

257
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:01,539
Sanjay and Rohit?
- ln the room downstairs

258
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:03,708
Where's the poor bachelor Karan?

259
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:06,586
Karan's sleeping in the hall
with Rahul and Payal

260
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,172
That's all right...
but where are we going to sleep?

261
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,967
We...? Come with me

262
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:17,012
We're going to sleep here.
- Here...?

263
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:21,349
''Why? lsn't it good enough?
- Oh no, it's first-class''

264
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:25,853
''People unnecessarily go to
places like London, Paris...''

265
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:29,065
New York and so on
for their honeymoon

266
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:32,359
This is a great place

267
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,656
And where is your pillow?
- Mine?

268
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:40,033
Here it is

269
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,038
You will never improve either

270
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:48,457
''We must leave now, dad.
We had a great time''

271
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,627
When are you coming again?
On Diwali?

272
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:55,756
But Holi's coming up before Diwali.
- Oh yes! For Holi!

273
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,061
Don't forget to call once
you get home

274
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:22,072
''ln just 24 hours, the house
appears to be so lonely again''

275
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,701
''True, but these 24 hours
gave us so much of joy''

276
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:30,621
Sanju wasn't to be seen.
ls he staying over for a few days?

277
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:33,791
There's still time for his train.
- l see

278
00:26:34,124 --> 00:26:36,251
And he...
- He...?

279
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:41,089
''He needs 50,000 rupees.
- 50,000 rupees?''

280
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,717
He wants to take a loan
to buy a car

281
00:26:45,176 --> 00:26:48,721
And what do you call one's
own initial contribution...?

282
00:26:49,221 --> 00:26:51,473
''The down payment.
- Yes, right''

283
00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:56,395
He's hesitating to tell you.
- Hesitating to tell me?

284
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:57,646
Yes

285
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,484
''What happened, dad?''

286
00:27:05,862 --> 00:27:08,698
l'm very angry with you.
- Angry? What...

287
00:27:09,156 --> 00:27:11,492
What you have done
is very bad

288
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:14,078
''Dad, l was only...
- Sit down''

289
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:22,127
''Now tell me, since when has your
Mummy been coming between you and me?''

290
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:25,129
''lf there's anything you need,
you must tell me...''

291
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:27,381
why hesitate in telling me?

292
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,800
''Dad, l thought maybe you will...''

293
00:27:30,217 --> 00:27:33,762
''My son, l am your father.
And as long as l live...''

294
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:36,765
my children need not worry
about anything

295
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:40,560
Go to Delhi without a worry.
The money will follow you there

296
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,774
''Don't you want to have breakfast?
- Sure, dad''

297
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:55,532
''lt's this loan of 50,000 that you've
sought against your gratuity''

298
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:59,578
''Do you realise, there will be nothing
left in your account after this?''

299
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:07,835
There's no question of turning down
a sincere employee like you

300
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:10,671
But you're a friend too

301
00:28:11,422 --> 00:28:16,176
And you have always encouraged people
to invest wisely for the future

302
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:19,846
But you haven't thought
of your own future

303
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:24,559
''Whatever you have earned, you have
spent in meeting your children's needs''

304
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:28,187
The truth is that
after one retires...

305
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:33,734
one's savings is his
greatest strength

306
00:28:35,277 --> 00:28:38,238
''My strength is the smile on
my children's faces, sir''

307
00:28:38,738 --> 00:28:42,659
What good is the money that is
of no use to my children?

308
00:28:43,284 --> 00:28:47,205
''ln any case, l'm just not worried about
what will happen after my retirement''

309
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:52,418
''By God's grace, l have four sons.
Four priceless fixed deposits''

310
00:28:53,585 --> 00:28:56,880
''Four fixed deposits,
eight able hands...''

311
00:28:57,297 --> 00:28:59,758
are more than enough for my support

312
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:10,768
''Documents for you, sir''

313
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:22,028
My dear lady! The flight might
be delayed in a take off...

314
00:29:22,612 --> 00:29:26,074
but you will never be late
in opening the door!

315
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:30,119
Why're you messing with the teapot?
Let that be and give me your hand...

316
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:32,079
your hand

317
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,252
Wow! So quickly?

318
00:29:39,628 --> 00:29:43,298
''As a father, one has to
do his sons' bidding''

319
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:46,300
Our children mustn't be held up
for the sake of money

320
00:29:46,676 --> 00:29:48,970
Whose letter is it?
- Alok's

321
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:51,305
lt must be the girl's pictures!

322
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:53,724
You're still such a kid!

323
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:56,602
''Let me see.
- Lovely girl, isn't she?''

324
00:29:57,477 --> 00:30:00,730
Yes. Beautiful couple

325
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:03,983
l'm glad Alok will
settle down too

326
00:30:04,442 --> 00:30:09,363
But you left no stone unturned
in making him what he is today

327
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:11,657
''No, Pooja.
l have done nothing''

328
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:16,953
This kid always had the spirit
to reach out for the skies

329
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:20,332
l have only encouraged his spirit

330
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,918
''lt seemed as if it happened
only yesterday, isn't it?''

331
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:26,546
On my mother's death anniversary...

332
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:28,798
the two of us were coming out
of the orphanage...

333
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:32,718
when a sweet little voice
made us freeze in our trail

334
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:35,179
''Sir! Want a shoeshine, sir?''

335
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:39,391
''Please, sir. l'll give it
a great shine for just one rupee''

336
00:30:43,478 --> 00:30:45,980
''ls that your book, son?''

337
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:49,692
''Yes, sir. l want to study.
And study a lot too''

338
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:53,821
People say it's very necessary to study
to achieve something in life

339
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:57,991
''So l shine shoes.
Please let me do it, sir''

340
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:05,957
What is your name?
- They call me Chhotu at the orphanage

341
00:31:06,374 --> 00:31:09,377
''But when l join a school,
l'll register myself as Alok''

342
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:14,006
Do you know what Alok means?
- Yes

343
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:17,759
''The manager says,
Alok means light''

344
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,097
''Who are you talking to, Chhotu?''

345
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:24,849
''You're still here, sir?
- Yes''

346
00:31:25,475 --> 00:31:28,894
''This child shall henceforth
be called Alok, not Chhotu''

347
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:31,855
He wants to study and
do something in life...

348
00:31:31,981 --> 00:31:33,899
and l'm sure he will do it

349
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,859
''Alok, come here''

350
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:41,114
''l'll have you admitted
to a school, son''

351
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:45,493
You can study there.
As much as you want to

352
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,497
''To do that, you won't need this''

353
00:31:49,955 --> 00:31:51,874
Enough. Be happy

354
00:31:57,546 --> 00:32:02,217
lt wasn't my feet. The child had
touched my heart that day

355
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:06,888
True. And he did what he wanted to

356
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:11,892
With his sincerity
and your loving support...

357
00:32:12,518 --> 00:32:16,104
Alok has even gone abroad
for studies. And now...

358
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:23,903
Mother?
- Alok?

359
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:26,489
You'll live a hundred years!
We were talking about you

360
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:29,909
Set it down. Let me also listen.
- Mother...

361
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,911
''Ask her about the photographs.
- Yes, l will''

362
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:35,539
Mother...
- Ask her!

363
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:38,542
Ask her is she has
received the envelope!

364
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,919
''Mother, that envelope...?''

365
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:45,506
''Young man, are you asking us about
the photographs or the envelope?''

366
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,632
''Hello, father''

367
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:49,218
''l must tell you,
we've received both''

368
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,719
So what do you think?

369
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:56,558
''She's okay. Although the nose
is a bit small, she's plump...''

370
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:02,021
''and the eyes, Pooja...?
- Why're you teasing him?''

371
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,899
''Alok, he's only joking''

372
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,944
''Arpita is very sweet.
- Thanks, mother''

373
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,866
Don't delay the good deed.
Get married immediately

374
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,536
Without your presence?

375
00:33:17,911 --> 00:33:23,917
''My son, think we are with you.
You have our blessings...''

376
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,586
but it's impossible for us
to be there with you

377
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:30,965
We'll wait for the day when you will
come home with our daughter-in-law

378
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:34,009
''Very well, father.
As you wish''

379
00:33:34,384 --> 00:33:35,969
Bless you. May you be happy

380
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:49,023
What happened?
What did they say?

381
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:52,276
Why do you look so worried?

382
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,990
Why the sad face?
Tell me what they said

383
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:04,329
''They said, you appear to be a snob''

384
00:34:05,663 --> 00:34:08,582
lf only your lips were...
it would be so good

385
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:10,209
Who said that?

386
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:13,587
Mummy said something
about being the snob...

387
00:34:13,712 --> 00:34:17,632
and father spoke about your lips.
As for the eyes...

388
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:20,010
As for the eyes...?

389
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:24,931
They said...
- What?

390
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:27,433
They can see your heart
in your eyes...

391
00:34:27,642 --> 00:34:31,604
with my picture etched on it.
- Who said that?

392
00:34:31,854 --> 00:34:36,024
Both. Orders are to get married
at the earliest

393
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:40,654
''With whom...?
- You, of course''

394
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:24,110
''Never before...''

395
00:35:24,694 --> 00:35:28,114
''was l in such a state''

396
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,702
''l've lost my sleep,
l'm losing my peace...''

397
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:36,496
''something surely
is happening to me''

398
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:48,549
''Never before...''

399
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:52,094
''was l in such a state''

400
00:35:53,762 --> 00:35:58,141
''l've lost my sleep,
l'm losing my peace...''

401
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:02,145
''something surely
is happening to me''

402
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:47,186
''lt's the first ever feeling
of love...''

403
00:36:55,861 --> 00:37:00,240
''how will l tell you
what my thirst is all about?''

404
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:07,163
''lt's restless,
it beats wildly...''

405
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:12,167
''my heart has found someone...''

406
00:37:12,293 --> 00:37:15,170
''something surely
is happening to me''

407
00:37:52,204 --> 00:37:56,833
''My beloved, l have found
on the path of love...''

408
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:08,219
''every desire of my heart
has been fulfilled''

409
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:15,225
''Let there be no distances
between us anymore''

410
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:20,230
''ln the shade of your tresses,
l'm going to sleep...''

411
00:38:20,855 --> 00:38:23,233
''something surely
is happening to me''

412
00:38:31,156 --> 00:38:35,244
''Never before...''

413
00:38:35,452 --> 00:38:39,289
''was l in such a state''

414
00:38:40,582 --> 00:38:45,294
''l've lost my sleep,
l'm losing my peace...''

415
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,297
''something surely
is happening to me''

416
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:32,921
Today's not a holiday...

417
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:35,924
so why's the bank so deserted?

418
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,356
What's all this?

419
00:39:52,982 --> 00:39:56,360
''Mr Malhotra, today is your
last day at the office''

420
00:39:56,985 --> 00:40:02,949
And everyone here says that it'll
be very lonely without you

421
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:08,663
''Raj, you are the one who shared
everyone's joys and sorrows...''

422
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:12,416
''you lent a ear to everyone.
But today, everyone will listen...''

423
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,752
and you will do the talking.
- What will l say?

424
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:22,050
lt's been 30 years.
365 days of a year...

425
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:25,428
and eight hours of the day...

426
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:30,057
l've spent a major part
of my life here with you folks

427
00:40:30,474 --> 00:40:32,434
With your love and affection

428
00:40:35,395 --> 00:40:37,064
l'm feeling sad about leaving

429
00:40:38,064 --> 00:40:41,443
But that's the rule of life

430
00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:44,028
One goes away and another comes
to take his place

431
00:40:45,113 --> 00:40:47,490
''When l leave, someone
else will come here...''

432
00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:50,493
''with a new name, a new face
and a new spirit''

433
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,122
''And l'll go away elsewhere,
take up another job''

434
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,543
There's my new boss

435
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,130
She's looking at me angrily
with the expression...

436
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:06,466
You'll never improve!
- Never

437
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:08,467
Raj Malhotra isn't one
who'll improve

438
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:17,434
''Malhotra saheb, we're all
very sad that you're retiring''

439
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:22,105
Why don't you take an extension of
another 2 years and continue with us?

440
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,147
Absolutely!

441
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:27,485
''Rawal saheb, in the mad rush
of our work...''

442
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:32,781
we treat life like a morsel
of food had in haste

443
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:38,120
''The rest of my life, l want to
take it easy and enjoy myself''

444
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,538
With my wife and kids

445
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,544
''Should you ever have the need,
do please remember...''

446
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,549
that the doors of this office and
our hearts are forever open to you

447
00:41:57,054 --> 00:41:58,138
Pooja...

448
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:09,732
''What happened?
- You ask, what happened?''

449
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:14,153
''Will you fix this tie, please?
- Where will you go then?''

450
00:42:15,153 --> 00:42:18,031
''Mr Malhotra, maybe
you're forgetting...''

451
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:21,701
that l have retired?
So what if l've retired?

452
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:24,954
''A tie, l will wear every day.
And that too...''

453
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:28,249
as usual

454
00:42:31,252 --> 00:42:33,754
Actually you're right

455
00:42:34,213 --> 00:42:36,381
Where will we go?
What will we do?

456
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:40,593
''l've read the newspaper
four times over, watched TV...''

457
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:44,180
''had my breakfast,
but things are so boring''

458
00:42:46,224 --> 00:42:50,186
''l think l must visit Mr Rawal
tomorrow and say, l'm joining duty''

459
00:42:52,229 --> 00:42:54,898
You're going back on your word now.
- Why?

460
00:42:55,357 --> 00:42:59,778
You're the one who told Mr Rawal
that you will live with your children

461
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:02,238
Didn't you say that?

462
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:06,284
''Oh yes, l did''

463
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:20,171
''Dear son. Lots of love
to all of you''

464
00:43:21,006 --> 00:43:23,550
''Your Mummy and l miss you all
very much''

465
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,720
''l miss you a bit too much.
Because l have all the time now''

466
00:43:28,137 --> 00:43:33,892
''l have retired and want to take
some decisions for the future''

467
00:43:35,102 --> 00:43:37,396
''We want you to help us
take the decision''

468
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,066
''Holi is coming up next week.
lf you could come over...''

469
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:44,068
''it would not only brighten the
festival, we could have a chat too''

470
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:47,280
''Lots of love.
Your Papa''

471
00:43:54,078 --> 00:43:56,997
''Hello, brother. Sanjay here.
- Yes, Sanjay?''

472
00:43:57,372 --> 00:43:59,958
''Have you received Papa's letter?
- Yes, l have''

473
00:44:00,292 --> 00:44:04,671
So what have you decided?
- Your sister-in-law says...

474
00:44:05,046 --> 00:44:08,924
we must all go there.
Dad has retired...

475
00:44:09,425 --> 00:44:13,053
he must have received the money
of his gratuity and provident fund

476
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:17,849
We must talk to him about what needs
to be done with such a huge amount

477
00:44:18,433 --> 00:44:20,852
We'll even celebrate
Holi there

478
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:33,280
''When music is made...''

479
00:44:35,157 --> 00:44:39,286
''the drum beat
rents the air''

480
00:44:42,122 --> 00:44:46,834
''When heart meets heart...''

481
00:44:51,463 --> 00:44:56,134
''one colour blends
into another''

482
00:44:59,054 --> 00:45:02,807
''So play with the colours,
O valiant heroes''

483
00:45:09,313 --> 00:45:12,650
''The valiant heroes of
Avadh play with the colours...''

484
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:15,611
''they play with the colours''

485
00:45:44,429 --> 00:45:47,348
''Here come swaying
the folks and the wives...''

486
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:53,520
''with gay abandon, play the
valiant heroes of Avadh''

487
00:45:54,438 --> 00:45:58,150
''So let's play with the colours''

488
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:35,100
''He feels no shame...''

489
00:46:35,434 --> 00:46:38,103
''he forgets how old he is''

490
00:46:47,111 --> 00:46:50,030
''At 60, he flirts with me''

491
00:46:50,698 --> 00:46:55,452
''He applies the colour on my face.
My beloved is indeed a colourful one''

492
00:47:00,582 --> 00:47:03,960
''He sprays the colours
on my scarf...''

493
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:06,921
''the valiant hero of Avadh
plays with the colours''

494
00:47:40,535 --> 00:47:45,498
''This season, do not douse
the colours on me''

495
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:52,046
''l have sworn
to stay off you''

496
00:48:03,556 --> 00:48:05,433
''She sizes me up
from head to toe...''

497
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,728
''my beloved won't look
in my heart''

498
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:20,280
''Although l'm old,
l'm young at heart...''

499
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:26,077
''take me in your arms.
Let your anklets chime''

500
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:37,504
''lt's so truly said, the valiant
heroes of Avadh play with the colours''

501
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:57,981
''Let's play with the colours''

502
00:49:59,562 --> 00:50:01,689
Dinner's about to be served

503
00:50:03,357 --> 00:50:06,068
''Grandpa, why do you always
sit on that chair?''

504
00:50:06,443 --> 00:50:08,528
Because this chair is meant
for the head of the family...

505
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:10,572
and l'm the head of this family.
- How come?

506
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:11,990
How come?

507
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:17,161
This dining table is
like a huge tree

508
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:21,248
''Your grandma, who's about
to sit there...''

509
00:50:21,624 --> 00:50:27,587
is the root of the tree.
She holds the tree together

510
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,257
And your grandpa
is the strong stem...

511
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:35,261
''who keeps a watch over everyone.
- How about Mummy, Papa...''

512
00:50:35,636 --> 00:50:38,014
uncle and aunt?
All the others?

513
00:50:38,347 --> 00:50:41,267
They... they're the branches
of this mighty tree

514
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:45,020
''And before you ask me what you
and Payal are, let me tell you...''

515
00:50:45,437 --> 00:50:48,940
you are the sweet fruit
this tree has borne!

516
00:50:50,817 --> 00:50:53,278
Here comes the food!

517
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:56,322
Wow! Almond halwa!

518
00:50:56,697 --> 00:50:58,366
This bowl is for me!

519
00:50:58,658 --> 00:51:00,493
No one else is getting it

520
00:51:02,828 --> 00:51:04,788
''Forget it, Rohit.
Everyone knows...''

521
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:07,791
''that the chief of the Branch, Ajju,
is Mom's favourite blue-eyed boy''

522
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,752
Make do with the water

523
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:13,171
''Wow, Mom! Phirni!''

524
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,966
Don't worry. l've made something
special for each one of you

525
00:51:17,383 --> 00:51:18,342
How about me?

526
00:51:18,634 --> 00:51:21,220
You can eat what we leave.
- Really?

527
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:33,189
''Come on, children''

528
00:51:33,565 --> 00:51:34,941
''C'mon, girls''

529
00:51:36,734 --> 00:51:41,447
You won't hurt your hand
if you put it in my mouth

530
00:51:44,741 --> 00:51:48,370
''After ages, we've enjoyed
Holi so much. lsn't it?''

531
00:51:48,703 --> 00:51:52,165
''Yes, father. this is the best Holi
l've had since my marriage''

532
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,043
And this is my first Holi.
- Don't tell me!

533
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,005
''When the family's together, every day's
Holi and Deepawali. Right, father?''

534
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:06,178
''Yes, my son. l must accept it
before the whole family...''

535
00:52:06,595 --> 00:52:09,639
that l'm indeed very fortunate
to have got so much of happiness

536
00:52:10,515 --> 00:52:12,934
There were only the two of us
to begin with

537
00:52:13,851 --> 00:52:18,022
''And gradually, with your arrival,
our joys knew no bounds''

538
00:52:18,439 --> 00:52:21,025
''Dad, there was something
you wanted to say?''

539
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,194
''Yes, there was something
l wanted to say''

540
00:52:25,571 --> 00:52:28,782
''But before l say it, there's
something l also want to ask you''

541
00:52:29,157 --> 00:52:30,241
''Go ahead, dad''

542
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:35,997
l have always believed
that l have very good sons

543
00:52:38,457 --> 00:52:42,086
What l want to know is
whether our children...

544
00:52:42,503 --> 00:52:44,922
consider their Mummy and Papa
to be any good too?

545
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:47,424
''Dad, you're the limit''

546
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:53,221
''l don't think anyone in the world
has as good parents we have, dad''

547
00:52:53,555 --> 00:52:58,934
''We are very lucky, dad, to have
loving and caring parents like you''

548
00:53:05,774 --> 00:53:07,692
Good. Now l can say
what l want to

549
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,571
lt's just this much

550
00:53:12,572 --> 00:53:19,036
lf we had to account for whatever we
had collected over the last 40 years...

551
00:53:19,703 --> 00:53:25,292
we would come to the conclusion that
in the struggle of life...

552
00:53:33,591 --> 00:53:36,761
''we never could be together,
despite wanting to''

553
00:53:39,555 --> 00:53:42,975
We didn't even get to know when you
had grown up and gone your ways

554
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:49,147
The joy that was in
living together...

555
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:53,526
came to us in small moments

556
00:53:54,652 --> 00:53:59,824
And we always kept looking forward
to these small moments...

557
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:03,160
when we would meet
and get together

558
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:10,000
But now l have retired

559
00:54:12,627 --> 00:54:14,796
And l have all the time
in the world

560
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:22,386
''And now, l want to make good what
l have lost in the last 40 years''

561
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:33,188
''By giving you our love,
by having your love...''

562
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:35,606
by staying with you

563
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:42,863
''Till now, we made a lot of
decisions for you''

564
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:51,913
''But now, we want you to
take this decision in our lives''

565
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,881
Your Mummy and Papa...

566
00:55:04,424 --> 00:55:07,969
don't want to stay away from you
anymore. They want to live with you

567
00:55:16,686 --> 00:55:18,646
You must now decide...

568
00:55:19,647 --> 00:55:24,193
''when, how and whom we
are going to stay with''

569
00:55:32,826 --> 00:55:35,161
That's all l had to say

570
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,920
You want to discuss it
among yourselves?

571
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:47,381
Go ahead. We'll go out

572
00:55:47,798 --> 00:55:50,300
''Come on, Pooja.
Let the kids get to work''

573
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,446
What?
Why's everyone looking at me?

574
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,699
The two of us have
a lot of problems anyway

575
00:56:18,534 --> 00:56:22,204
To live in a city that's so
expensive... you know how it is

576
00:56:22,871 --> 00:56:25,207
And we have to get our daughter
married in a couple of years

577
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:30,045
What happens of that?
- Absolutely. lt's just not possible

578
00:56:30,337 --> 00:56:32,964
l'd definitely have taken
Mom and Dad with me

579
00:56:33,715 --> 00:56:36,634
But Reena goes to work
and...

580
00:56:37,009 --> 00:56:39,637
No way! To work in
the office all day...

581
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:43,766
and put up with the arrogance of my
in-laws at home! That's not happening

582
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:52,357
l've just started a new life.
l'm in a bad way

583
00:56:52,774 --> 00:56:54,692
l've got to change residence
every eleven months

584
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:58,612
''Karan, why don't you take them along?
You'll be looked after and so will they''

585
00:56:59,071 --> 00:57:01,657
''Wow, sister-in-law!
Thanks but no thanks!''

586
00:57:02,074 --> 00:57:04,827
l can barely look after myself.
How will l take care of them?

587
00:57:07,204 --> 00:57:09,623
The kids are taking a lot
of time in taking a decision

588
00:57:09,998 --> 00:57:13,960
They must be having a fight about
who will take us home first

589
00:57:14,919 --> 00:57:16,754
''Oh yes, that's quite possible''

590
00:57:27,014 --> 00:57:30,600
Think of something.
What are we going to do?

591
00:57:32,894 --> 00:57:38,024
''What else, Kiran? We'll have to
take Mom and Dad with us''

592
00:57:40,067 --> 00:57:41,819
They have no one here

593
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:47,657
''For years, we have lived
as we wanted to, Ajay''

594
00:57:48,074 --> 00:57:51,703
''lt's not a joke to suddenly start
all over again, is it?''

595
00:57:52,287 --> 00:57:53,288
One minute

596
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,458
Can't Mummy and Daddy continue
to live here?

597
00:57:57,833 --> 00:58:00,836
''Whatever help they need, we...
- What are you saying, sister-in-law?''

598
00:58:01,253 --> 00:58:03,672
Help... and Dad...?
He'll never accept it!

599
00:58:04,131 --> 00:58:05,591
l have an idea

600
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:12,180
''Brother, you take Mummy with you.
And l'll take Papa to my house''

601
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:14,724
''Three months later,
Papa will go to Rohit's place...''

602
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:18,519
and Mummy will go to Karan's.
They'll get to live with all of us

603
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:23,357
And that won't burden anyone either.
Well? What do you say?

604
00:58:23,816 --> 00:58:25,609
''That's a flop idea, brother''

605
00:58:27,069 --> 00:58:31,406
You know very well that Mom and Dad
will never agree to part from each other

606
00:58:31,823 --> 00:58:34,575
That's the main punch of
my husband's idea

607
00:58:35,827 --> 00:58:38,496
Neither will Mummy and Papa agree
to live apart from each other...

608
00:58:38,871 --> 00:58:42,249
nor will they come to live with us.
End of the problem

609
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:48,130
They'll be happy where they are
and we'll be happy in our homes

610
00:58:50,882 --> 00:58:52,509
Here they are

611
00:58:54,844 --> 00:58:57,221
''Sorry to have kept the
two of you waiting, dad''

612
00:58:57,847 --> 00:59:02,226
''Actually, we couldn't decide which
one of us will take you along first''

613
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:07,731
''Karan said, if Mummy and Papa live
with everyone in turns...''

614
00:59:08,106 --> 00:59:10,066
his turn would come after 2 years

615
00:59:11,901 --> 00:59:15,780
Why must l wait for so long?
- Hey Karan... l come before you

616
00:59:16,114 --> 00:59:19,450
l wish l could have Mummy
and Papa with me. Forever

617
00:59:20,326 --> 00:59:22,745
We thought about everybody's
feelings and decided that...

618
00:59:23,162 --> 00:59:27,624
Papa will live with us
and Mummy will stay with Kiran

619
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,962
''After six months, Papa
can move to Rohit's...''

620
00:59:33,379 --> 00:59:35,339
and Mummy can go to Karan's

621
00:59:37,592 --> 00:59:40,386
''ln that way, all of us
will have your love''

622
00:59:40,803 --> 00:59:42,554
What do you think?
- Great idea

623
00:59:47,392 --> 00:59:49,644
lmpossible! They don't
want to share our love...

624
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,397
they want to split the two of us!
- Will you listen...?

625
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:55,441
l'm not listening and l can't
part with you. And that's it

626
00:59:59,111 --> 01:00:03,741
''Now look, you are mistaking
your own flesh and blood''

627
01:00:04,074 --> 01:00:08,620
''That's just what l regret, Pooja!
Despite being our flesh and blood...''

628
01:00:08,995 --> 01:00:12,457
''and a part of us, they can't see
that their parents are one''

629
01:00:13,374 --> 01:00:15,626
God has united us as one...

630
01:00:16,085 --> 01:00:18,629
and they think of separating us?
- That's not how it is

631
01:00:19,088 --> 01:00:22,883
l don't want to listen to anything.
Go and tell your children...

632
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,260
that we are happy where we are

633
01:00:27,095 --> 01:00:30,640
l never needed their support in the
past. Nor will l in the future

634
01:00:31,266 --> 01:00:34,894
How can you say such things?
What mistake have they made?

635
01:00:36,187 --> 01:00:38,648
They have yearned for our love
for so many years

636
01:00:39,273 --> 01:00:45,237
''To have that, they have found a way.
So why are you so angry?''

637
01:00:49,115 --> 01:00:54,871
''Look, please don't suspect
our children's intentions''

638
01:00:57,331 --> 01:00:59,333
Please don't break their heart

639
01:01:01,377 --> 01:01:05,005
l place you under oath

640
01:01:07,174 --> 01:01:10,552
You know how your tears
and oaths weaken me

641
01:01:16,307 --> 01:01:20,394
All right. Go ahead. And tell
your children what you want to

642
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:41,664
We agree with your decision

643
01:01:43,082 --> 01:01:46,335
Let us know when and where
we are going

644
01:01:55,301 --> 01:01:58,179
''And you guys were rejoicing
at your idea, weren't you?''

645
01:01:59,138 --> 01:02:00,764
See what happened?

646
01:02:01,223 --> 01:02:04,810
How were we to know that they so
badly want to come to our houses...

647
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:07,145
that they'd even agree
to live separately?

648
01:02:25,912 --> 01:02:33,544
''O Sun, who has spread this
gloomy sunshine in my rosegarden?''

649
01:02:42,177 --> 01:02:48,391
''Why the darkness
of loneliness...?''

650
01:03:00,361 --> 01:03:03,322
''What did you seek?
And what did you get...?''

651
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:05,657
''think hard, O Guardian''

652
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,381
''God is our Guardian...''

653
01:03:23,173 --> 01:03:25,384
''only God is our Protector''

654
01:03:45,485 --> 01:03:47,779
''You're still here, Karan?
Who'll get a cab? Go on''

655
01:03:49,322 --> 01:03:53,117
Will you hurry up a bit?
- l can't shut the bag

656
01:03:53,493 --> 01:03:56,162
''l can't understand why you travel
with so much of luggage, Priya''

657
01:03:56,496 --> 01:04:00,624
Don't fight. Go on.
l'll see

658
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:17,932
Want me to fix the tie?

659
01:04:21,518 --> 01:04:25,272
l'm not going to wear the tie.
Never again

660
01:04:56,342 --> 01:04:58,803
Listen... come here

661
01:05:10,563 --> 01:05:14,275
l won't be there with you

662
01:05:16,569 --> 01:05:18,529
Take your medicines on time

663
01:05:20,364 --> 01:05:22,991
You have an allergy
to frozen foods

664
01:05:24,243 --> 01:05:25,911
Don't forget

665
01:05:27,537 --> 01:05:29,539
Ram Avtar says...

666
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:35,211
if the rudraksh remains
near your heart...

667
01:05:38,589 --> 01:05:40,549
your blood pressure will be normal

668
01:05:43,594 --> 01:05:45,554
''You are the one who's
closest to my heart, Pooja''

669
01:05:47,264 --> 01:05:51,142
There's no room for a rudraksh
or anything else

670
01:05:53,144 --> 01:05:54,896
You will never improve

671
01:05:56,689 --> 01:06:00,401
''Yes, l will never improve.
Never''

672
01:06:01,652 --> 01:06:04,821
''Where are Mom and Dad?
- lnside, romancing''

673
01:06:05,572 --> 01:06:08,366
Mom and Dad! Hurry up!
We're getting late

674
01:06:28,635 --> 01:06:35,600
''Who has lit the fire
of sorrow...?''

675
01:06:38,644 --> 01:06:43,399
''my fields are rendered
wastelands''

676
01:06:44,399 --> 01:06:50,947
''From a thriving garden
of life...''

677
01:06:51,698 --> 01:06:56,244
''rises a sandstorm''

678
01:06:58,537 --> 01:07:01,332
''What did you sow?
What did you reap...?''

679
01:07:01,707 --> 01:07:03,917
''think about it, Caretaker''

680
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,349
''Only God is our Protector today''

681
01:07:20,766 --> 01:07:23,435
''He's our only Caretaker''

682
01:07:41,493 --> 01:07:42,911
''Must say, Raju''

683
01:07:44,454 --> 01:07:48,667
Nice way you're repaid me for a
friendship and love of 40 years

684
01:07:49,709 --> 01:07:51,461
What had you said to me?

685
01:07:52,462 --> 01:07:54,964
''That we're friends as youngsters,
we will not part even as old men''

686
01:07:55,882 --> 01:08:00,052
''So what happened now?
Where is your friendship, love...''

687
01:08:00,553 --> 01:08:03,263
''affection and loyalty...?
- Ram Avtar, listen to me...''

688
01:08:03,722 --> 01:08:07,976
l don't want to listen to anything.
You're a cheat of the first order

689
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:12,689
''Without even a word to me,
you're breaking all relationships?''

690
01:08:14,607 --> 01:08:18,778
Breaking relations?
With you and this house?

691
01:08:19,403 --> 01:08:21,405
This is the house
where l brought my wife

692
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,490
This is where my children
were born and brought up

693
01:08:23,907 --> 01:08:26,910
Will l break relations with it?
No way

694
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:31,289
l have very fond memories
with you and this house

695
01:08:31,748 --> 01:08:33,833
How can l severe ties
with them?

696
01:08:34,751 --> 01:08:35,668
Tell me

697
01:08:41,757 --> 01:08:42,966
Here you are

698
01:08:45,761 --> 01:08:47,387
What will l do with it?

699
01:08:47,763 --> 01:08:49,889
What will l do with the keys?

700
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:54,394
Must l erase your memories
and find a new tenant?

701
01:08:55,812 --> 01:08:59,523
No tenant is ever going to live here.
This is your house

702
01:09:01,025 --> 01:09:02,776
And yours it will always be

703
01:09:08,782 --> 01:09:11,242
''l must leave now, brother''

704
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:46,525
l'll take the dogs with me.
l can't see them stay apart and suffer

705
01:09:55,741 --> 01:09:58,119
''Stay with Karan.
And don't bother him, okay?''

706
01:10:13,883 --> 01:10:15,176
Mama...

707
01:10:16,636 --> 01:10:19,472
our taxi's over there

708
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,454
How much?
- 80 bucks

709
01:12:01,592 --> 01:12:04,053
''What will l say?
When we got there, we were told...''

710
01:12:04,428 --> 01:12:07,348
that Sanju's father has retired.
He has neither a place to stay...

711
01:12:07,765 --> 01:12:10,309
nor any money. What could l do?
l had to bring him along

712
01:12:11,768 --> 01:12:13,311
Tell me about yourself

713
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:17,357
''Please don't suspect
our children's intentions''

714
01:12:18,483 --> 01:12:20,276
''Please don't break their heart''

715
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:23,487
''l place you under oath''

716
01:12:27,491 --> 01:12:29,451
Let's go to our room!
- Our room?

717
01:12:29,743 --> 01:12:33,455
''Yes, your room and mine.
C'mon!''

718
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:39,419
''Hello, sir.
- Hello, Lalita bai''

719
01:12:39,752 --> 01:12:41,004
''Come on in, Mom''

720
01:12:42,755 --> 01:12:43,673
l'll be right back

721
01:12:43,965 --> 01:12:46,467
''Hello, madam.
- Hello. ls everything okay?''

722
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:52,222
''Lalita-bai, take Mom's luggage
to Payal's room''

723
01:12:53,849 --> 01:12:55,850
l can't share my room with anyone

724
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,229
''Payal, she's your grandmother.
- So what?''

725
01:13:00,563 --> 01:13:03,316
l don't want to compromise
my privacy at any cost

726
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:12,366
''This girl won't even let me into
her room for a long time, Mummy''

727
01:13:12,783 --> 01:13:16,369
What are you getting at?
ls Mom going to live in the hall?

728
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:20,123
''Don't be upset, son.
l'll manage anywhere''

729
01:13:20,498 --> 01:13:22,500
Just find a place
to keep my luggage

730
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:25,419
''Lalita, keep her luggage
in your room''

731
01:13:25,753 --> 01:13:28,005
And spread a new bedsheet
on the bed

732
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:32,759
ln my room?
- Yes. You can sleep in the kitchen

733
01:13:35,554 --> 01:13:39,432
''Who does she think she is? With the
luggage in my room, where will l go?''

734
01:13:39,807 --> 01:13:42,059
''At this rate,
l'm going to move out soon''

735
01:13:56,990 --> 01:14:00,493
''Where do l keep your glasses, grandpa?
- Oh yes, give that to me''

736
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:04,497
And what is this?
- lt's a typewriter

737
01:14:04,955 --> 01:14:09,043
Why've you brought the typewriter?
You can type on my computer instead

738
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:13,422
''This is the typewriter your grandma
gifted to me, my son''

739
01:14:13,797 --> 01:14:16,549
She asked me to write to her.
But l never had the opportunity

740
01:14:16,925 --> 01:14:19,219
''Neither was l separated from her,
nor did l ever write to her''

741
01:14:19,636 --> 01:14:26,016
''But now, l'm going to type out
a letter to your grandma''

742
01:14:28,102 --> 01:14:32,230
''Grandpa, you love grandma
very much, don't you?''

743
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:36,484
''Sure, l do.
- And she loves you a lot too?''

744
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:39,153
She loves me just too much

745
01:14:39,654 --> 01:14:45,618
''l'll give you so much of love,
you will never miss grandma!''

746
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:57,879
''Yes, son. l can only
think of your grandma now''

747
01:15:21,067 --> 01:15:23,027
''Dinner is served, Sanju''

748
01:15:31,952 --> 01:15:35,413
''Papa-ji, that's Sanju's place.
Please sit on the other chair''

749
01:15:48,634 --> 01:15:50,761
''Mummy, that chair is for the head
of the family''

750
01:15:51,094 --> 01:15:54,347
''And grandpa is the head!
- That's true, my son''

751
01:15:54,764 --> 01:15:58,476
But the one who sits there
has a lot of work to do

752
01:15:58,768 --> 01:16:01,521
''Passing around the dishes,
looking into everyone's plate''

753
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:04,649
''Let your Papa do that, not me''

754
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:15,575
''Where were you, Reena?
l called your office''

755
01:16:15,992 --> 01:16:17,952
l was very busy.
Was it something important?

756
01:16:18,328 --> 01:16:21,414
Nothing important. l thought we'd
have a Chinese meal together

757
01:16:21,789 --> 01:16:25,376
''Tomorrow.
Right now, eat what l've made''

758
01:16:28,128 --> 01:16:30,339
''Stop it now, Sanju.
You've done enough work''

759
01:16:30,756 --> 01:16:32,632
''A bit more, darling.
- No''

760
01:16:33,008 --> 01:16:34,926
l've got to wake up early.
Come on

761
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:38,930
Come on!

762
01:16:41,724 --> 01:16:42,725
Let's go

763
01:16:43,309 --> 01:16:45,102
You want me to come running to you?

764
01:16:45,728 --> 01:16:46,729
Listen son...

765
01:16:48,147 --> 01:16:49,940
The telephone...?

766
01:16:51,984 --> 01:16:53,276
could l...

767
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,321
use it...?

768
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:01,325
to talk to your mother

769
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:14,463
''And where is your pillow?
- Mine?''

770
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,756
''Here it is''

771
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:33,618
l've been waiting for your call.
Did you reach home safely?

772
01:18:34,828 --> 01:18:36,830
This is the first time
l'm not with you...

773
01:18:37,205 --> 01:18:40,208
l can't go to sleep without you.
l'm missing you very much

774
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,043
How are you?

775
01:18:44,045 --> 01:18:46,422
''Why don't you speak?
Say something, please''

776
01:18:48,132 --> 01:18:50,884
''You and l are separated...''

777
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:54,137
''what has life come to?''

778
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:17,826
''You and l are
separated...''

779
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:23,247
''what has life come to?''

780
01:19:25,916 --> 01:19:30,546
''You are the only one l see
everywhere l cast a glance, my love''

781
01:19:41,305 --> 01:19:46,435
''l get no sleep...
l miss you badly''

782
01:19:47,061 --> 01:19:51,106
''l can't live
without you anymore''

783
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,489
''You and l are
separated...''

784
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,578
''what has life come to?''

785
01:20:28,307 --> 01:20:31,393
''lt's as if Time has come
to a standstill''

786
01:20:32,269 --> 01:20:35,230
''There's gloom everywhere''

787
01:20:37,273 --> 01:20:39,234
''l pine for you...''

788
01:20:40,026 --> 01:20:42,361
''l'm lonely in body,
thirsting in soul''

789
01:20:45,281 --> 01:20:49,243
''Not even for a moment...''

790
01:20:50,285 --> 01:20:54,414
''why won't your face
fade away from my eyes?''

791
01:20:58,334 --> 01:21:02,463
''Days and nights do go by...''

792
01:21:03,464 --> 01:21:07,676
''a lonely life,
just won't go by''

793
01:21:18,311 --> 01:21:22,899
''l can't say a word to you,
even if l wish to...''

794
01:21:23,274 --> 01:21:28,237
''what anguish do l suffer?''

795
01:21:34,034 --> 01:21:36,453
''You and l are
separated...''

796
01:21:39,122 --> 01:21:41,833
''what has life come to?''

797
01:21:52,175 --> 01:21:55,428
Okay then... bye

798
01:21:59,140 --> 01:22:00,892
Don't forget to write

799
01:22:03,436 --> 01:22:07,773
''Whenever l hear footsteps...''

800
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:13,278
''l feel as if you have arrived''

801
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:20,910
''Like a whiff of fresh air...''

802
01:22:21,452 --> 01:22:26,415
''you have lent
fragrance to my breath''

803
01:22:36,424 --> 01:22:41,345
''Those were the days
when we were always together...''

804
01:22:41,763 --> 01:22:46,392
''and there is so much of
distance between us now''

805
01:22:52,189 --> 01:22:55,358
''You and l are
separated...''

806
01:22:57,318 --> 01:23:00,363
''what has life come to?''

807
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,662
''Good dogs don't bite
good folks, son''

808
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:58,875
''l'm glad you stopped him, mota bhai...
He kept chasing me like mad''

809
01:23:59,209 --> 01:24:02,461
But why was it chasing you?
- He was making me jog

810
01:24:03,296 --> 01:24:06,215
That dog came in my wife's dowry.
lt's from my in-laws' place

811
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:10,219
And l thought it wanted to bite you.
- That's my wife's job

812
01:24:10,636 --> 01:24:12,721
He only makes me run

813
01:24:14,139 --> 01:24:16,057
But l'm surprised he stopped
at your voice

814
01:24:16,516 --> 01:24:18,852
''Yes, l have two dogs too.
Tiger and Pinky''

815
01:24:19,227 --> 01:24:23,481
l also take them for a stroll.
- l see. You've just arrived in Delhi?

816
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,484
''Yes, l came only yesterday
to stay with my son''

817
01:24:26,817 --> 01:24:29,278
See that building there...?
Urvashi...? That's the one

818
01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:32,197
Whose flat in Urvashi?
- Sanjay... Sanjay Malhotra

819
01:24:32,572 --> 01:24:36,826
''Third floor? So you're Sanjay's father?
- Yes, do you know him?''

820
01:24:37,243 --> 01:24:39,162
''Of course. He has a son, Rahul''

821
01:24:39,495 --> 01:24:42,290
Very sweet kid.
He comes to my music cafe

822
01:24:42,582 --> 01:24:44,875
Music cafe...?
- Behind Urvashi...

823
01:24:45,251 --> 01:24:48,462
Archie's Music Cafe. lt's mine.
- l see

824
01:24:49,546 --> 01:24:53,300
''lt's two in one. Listen to the music
and drink coffee, if you wish to''

825
01:24:54,259 --> 01:24:56,177
''Actually, it's three in one.
- Three in one?''

826
01:24:56,553 --> 01:24:59,138
''ln the ''hole'' inside, there's a library.
Read whatever book you want to''

827
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:02,266
''You mean, one has to
get into a hole to read?''

828
01:25:02,642 --> 01:25:06,770
''No! Not ''hole''...
a big ''hole''. 20 by 20''

829
01:25:09,606 --> 01:25:13,276
Hall! l see!
So you're a Gujarati?

830
01:25:13,652 --> 01:25:16,988
''But my wife's Hindi speaking.
- Two in one again, l see''

831
01:25:17,655 --> 01:25:20,241
''Mota bhai... comic punch, eh?''

832
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:24,453
Why do you call me Mota bhai.
Do l look mota (mota=fat) ?

833
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:31,918
''Not fat... in Gujarati, mota bhai
means elder brother. Out of respect''

834
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,671
What is your name?
- Hemantbhai Patel

835
01:25:35,755 --> 01:25:38,174
''Yes, l'm leaving.
He's going to make me run''

836
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:42,178
You must come to my music cafe and
drink the coffee my wife makes

837
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:44,347
First class coffee

838
01:25:45,347 --> 01:25:47,808
l only drink the tea
my wife brews...

839
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,852
l mean...

840
01:25:51,395 --> 01:25:52,354
l used to

841
01:25:52,729 --> 01:25:57,609
''For the first time, l am not
serving you tea today''

842
01:26:21,464 --> 01:26:25,259
Here you are with the newspaper
and Sanju's been screaming for it

843
01:26:25,676 --> 01:26:28,095
You'll remain at home all day.
You can read it later

844
01:26:41,649 --> 01:26:45,194
Kiran... where are you?

845
01:26:45,653 --> 01:26:48,947
What is the matter?
- Am l not getting any tea?

846
01:26:49,656 --> 01:26:52,409
l knew this was coming.
- What is coming?

847
01:26:52,743 --> 01:26:55,829
''You know, the maid has run away
after Mummy arrived?''

848
01:26:56,371 --> 01:26:58,039
She has run away?

849
01:26:58,456 --> 01:27:01,417
What has Mama to do
with the maid running away?

850
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:05,087
You don't know how spoilt
the servants are nowadays

851
01:27:05,504 --> 01:27:07,256
She refused to sleep in the kitchen!

852
01:27:08,716 --> 01:27:11,260
Why are you quiet? l'm not getting
up early to make tea for everybody

853
01:27:11,718 --> 01:27:14,262
''Let her make the tea for herself.
- Don't be upset, Kiran''

854
01:27:14,638 --> 01:27:16,097
l'm here

855
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,601
l'm in the habit of working

856
01:27:20,393 --> 01:27:24,605
l used to make the tea for your Papa.
Now l'll make it for my children

857
01:27:33,738 --> 01:27:36,199
Reena! Hurry up!

858
01:27:37,742 --> 01:27:39,744
l'll be delayed again because of you!
- What can l do?

859
01:27:40,161 --> 01:27:42,788
There's an extra man's work to do
l've got to cook for your father...

860
01:27:43,164 --> 01:27:47,710
''iron his clothes, get Rahul ready,
and there's no one to help''

861
01:27:54,716 --> 01:27:55,967
''Bye, my child''

862
01:28:22,742 --> 01:28:27,037
''Mummy, l'm leaving for the kitty party.
Cook whatever you want to for yourself''

863
01:28:27,746 --> 01:28:29,373
But Payal...
- She has already left

864
01:28:29,748 --> 01:28:32,084
She'll return only in the evening
after her dance classes. Bye

865
01:28:43,761 --> 01:28:44,845
Mota bhai!

866
01:28:48,766 --> 01:28:50,225
Come on!

867
01:28:52,352 --> 01:28:56,439
''Welcome, mota bhai!
This is my music cafe''

868
01:28:56,773 --> 01:28:58,525
Come on inside

869
01:29:00,818 --> 01:29:02,403
The music cafe... see?

870
01:29:03,863 --> 01:29:05,322
Shanti...

871
01:29:06,824 --> 01:29:09,785
take care of your dowry

872
01:29:10,118 --> 01:29:13,163
l'm coming...
and you're always picking on him

873
01:29:13,538 --> 01:29:16,041
What is it? Why've you been yelling?
- The dog's been barking...

874
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:18,376
and she says l'm yelling!
This is Rahul's grandpa

875
01:29:18,793 --> 01:29:22,004
''l told you that l met him in
the garden. Mota-bhai, this is my wife''

876
01:29:22,713 --> 01:29:23,965
Namaste.
- Namaste

877
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,428
''Forgive me, you dropped
your lemons because of me''

878
01:29:29,803 --> 01:29:33,223
You speak very good Hindi.
- Please don't embarrass me

879
01:29:33,557 --> 01:29:36,476
''Things will fall, mota bhai. But she
broke some eggs the other day''

880
01:29:36,851 --> 01:29:41,230
''She's not just my wife,
she's my life! My better-half''

881
01:29:41,606 --> 01:29:44,400
Please be seated. l'll get
some great coffee for you

882
01:29:44,817 --> 01:29:46,777
Could l have some tea instead?

883
01:29:47,611 --> 01:29:50,364
At least try the coffee l make

884
01:29:50,864 --> 01:29:53,450
He wants tea. So get him tea.
And make it nicely

885
01:29:53,867 --> 01:29:56,536
''The other day you made tea and the
customer said, ''Wonderful soup''

886
01:29:58,872 --> 01:30:00,832
How would a monkey know
the stage is bent?

887
01:30:01,874 --> 01:30:06,337
''God! lf you must use proverbs in
Hindi, at least get them properly''

888
01:30:06,754 --> 01:30:10,007
''Why do you mix them up?
- No, l always use single terms''

889
01:30:10,674 --> 01:30:14,302
''Lies! You decide this, mota bhai.
You are Hindi speaking, aren't you?''

890
01:30:14,678 --> 01:30:17,639
''The one he used just now,
wasn't it a mix of two proverbs?''

891
01:30:17,972 --> 01:30:20,475
Two.
- Two? How?

892
01:30:20,892 --> 01:30:23,269
''How would a monkey know
the taste of ginger''

893
01:30:24,562 --> 01:30:26,564
''The one who can't dance
blames the dance floor''

894
01:30:26,981 --> 01:30:30,692
l mixed up ginger and dance floor.
- Hear that? Okay?

895
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:33,653
l'll get you some nice tea now

896
01:30:34,446 --> 01:30:36,656
The lemons! She left them here!

897
01:30:37,032 --> 01:30:39,701
Great! You have indeed
a cheerful place here

898
01:30:40,118 --> 01:30:43,371
lsn't it? Earlier we pined
for a child

899
01:30:43,746 --> 01:30:45,581
And now there are so many
boys and girls around

900
01:30:45,956 --> 01:30:48,208
''We don't have a child, you see''

901
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,712
Hey kids... come here

902
01:30:56,091 --> 01:30:59,594
This is the kid party.
And this is Mr Raj Malhotra

903
01:30:59,969 --> 01:31:01,929
He's like my elder brother.
Please be seated

904
01:31:02,513 --> 01:31:05,933
''This is Kapil. ln London,
his father...''

905
01:31:06,976 --> 01:31:07,434
has a publication.
And that's Nili

906
01:31:10,562 --> 01:31:12,439
She's fair of skin but
calls herself nili (blue)

907
01:31:27,161 --> 01:31:30,038
''Kiran...
- She has gone out somewhere, son''

908
01:31:30,664 --> 01:31:33,625
She must've told you where she's going?
- No

909
01:31:34,709 --> 01:31:36,044
She must be coming

910
01:31:36,711 --> 01:31:39,047
''May l say something, son?''

911
01:31:41,799 --> 01:31:44,051
You must keep a track
of these things...

912
01:31:44,343 --> 01:31:47,680
''where your wife is,
where your daughter is''

913
01:31:47,805 --> 01:31:51,058
Your Papa always took care
of these things

914
01:31:51,725 --> 01:31:56,479
''That was interference on his part, Mom.
lt was his dominating nature''

915
01:32:01,692 --> 01:32:05,112
Every human being must have the right
to lead the life he wants to

916
01:32:05,738 --> 01:32:08,699
But there's need for
order in the family

917
01:32:09,074 --> 01:32:14,663
lt's your job. Your Papa always
kept the family under control

918
01:32:14,871 --> 01:32:16,664
He maintained a certain amount
of discipline

919
01:32:16,873 --> 01:32:21,085
He kept the family together.
- Not so much discipline...

920
01:32:21,711 --> 01:32:25,673
as to start interfering in each
other's lives and ruining their freedom

921
01:32:26,715 --> 01:32:30,052
Whatever he did
was for our own well-being

922
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:32,054
lt was only his love

923
01:32:33,722 --> 01:32:38,017
''When love crosses its limits,
it becomes suffocating, Mom''

924
01:32:39,936 --> 01:32:43,105
''You mean, our love for you
was stifling you?''

925
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:48,110
Why're you getting into this argument?
You're here as a guest for a few days

926
01:32:48,277 --> 01:32:50,154
So behave like a guest

927
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:56,910
l came here because
l thought it was my house

928
01:32:57,786 --> 01:33:01,164
But you have turned your mother
into a guest

929
01:33:19,305 --> 01:33:20,639
Haven't you gone to sleep?

930
01:33:21,307 --> 01:33:24,268
''l couldn't go to sleep, but what are
you upto? lt's 2 in the morning''

931
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:28,897
''l have a presentation of a new project
at the office tomorrow, dad''

932
01:33:30,273 --> 01:33:32,525
''So l'll have to complete
my work, won't l?''

933
01:33:40,282 --> 01:33:41,659
''Not your cup of tea, dad''

934
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:46,246
Why not? This is what l've been
doing for the last forty years

935
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:51,084
How can you compare
your petty 9 to 5 job...

936
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,712
with the workload of
a multinational like ours?

937
01:33:55,838 --> 01:34:01,719
''ln your days, there wasn't any
competition nor any tension''

938
01:34:03,345 --> 01:34:06,348
But we've got to keep up
all nights to survive

939
01:34:06,515 --> 01:34:10,352
So you think things were
very easy for us?

940
01:34:11,394 --> 01:34:15,648
''That we had no tension in our lives?
Of course, there was the tension''

941
01:34:16,315 --> 01:34:19,944
''But despite that, we gave the
best of our output to our work...''

942
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,697
''we worked hard for a living,
earned respect...''

943
01:34:24,323 --> 01:34:27,617
l brought up four sons to lead a
life with their heads held high

944
01:34:28,869 --> 01:34:31,704
''Yes, dad. But you will
have to admit, dad...''

945
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:36,292
''that your sons had the ability,
the skill and the talent...''

946
01:34:36,501 --> 01:34:40,337
with which they paved a way for
themselves and achieved their goals

947
01:34:40,671 --> 01:34:42,756
''And built this house.
That's not all, dad''

948
01:34:43,007 --> 01:34:46,009
''With my presence, l have
also secured my future...''

949
01:34:47,386 --> 01:34:50,347
so that l don't have to beg
before anyone when l grow old

950
01:34:54,058 --> 01:34:57,311
''What happened, dad?
Why're you looking at me like that?''

951
01:35:00,439 --> 01:35:03,359
''You have to agree, whatever we are
today, it's on our own steam''

952
01:35:03,525 --> 01:35:05,944
''ln any case, what have
you done for us?''

953
01:35:18,956 --> 01:35:22,251
''that your sons had the ability,
the skill and the talent...''

954
01:35:22,376 --> 01:35:25,754
''with which they paved a way for
themselves and achieved their goals''

955
01:35:25,921 --> 01:35:28,006
''And built this house.
That's not all, dad''

956
01:35:28,423 --> 01:35:31,342
''With my presence, l have
also secured my future...''

957
01:35:31,593 --> 01:35:34,387
''so that l don't have to beg
before anyone when l grow old''

958
01:35:38,724 --> 01:35:40,392
True...

959
01:35:44,438 --> 01:35:46,398
what have we done for them?

960
01:35:53,446 --> 01:35:55,823
lf we have fed you children...

961
01:35:55,948 --> 01:36:00,870
and ourselves gone to bed
on a hungry stomach...

962
01:36:00,995 --> 01:36:02,871
what have we done for you?

963
01:36:09,002 --> 01:36:11,880
lf we have killed every
little desire we had...

964
01:36:14,424 --> 01:36:16,384
to fulfill all your...

965
01:36:18,427 --> 01:36:21,180
''to fulfill all your needs,
what have we done for you?''

966
01:36:25,434 --> 01:36:30,397
lf we have sacrificed
our present for your future...

967
01:36:33,149 --> 01:36:34,817
what have we...

968
01:36:36,486 --> 01:36:37,862
still done for you?

969
01:36:46,495 --> 01:36:48,455
We have done nothing
for anyone

970
01:36:55,503 --> 01:36:57,463
Nothing at all

971
01:37:06,555 --> 01:37:11,476
''Walking in your footsteps when we
were taking the vows, l thought...''

972
01:37:11,851 --> 01:37:13,478
''l was your shadow''

973
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,439
''But you took my hand
and said...''

974
01:37:17,523 --> 01:37:20,860
''you are not my shadow,
you are my better half...''

975
01:37:21,527 --> 01:37:23,487
''my companion for life''

976
01:37:25,530 --> 01:37:29,868
''Separated from you,
l feel so incomplete''

977
01:37:30,535 --> 01:37:32,495
''Neither is it the same 7
in the morning anymore...''

978
01:37:33,037 --> 01:37:34,872
''nor is it 5:30 of the old times''

979
01:37:35,498 --> 01:37:38,876
''Nor even do l find the tea
any sweet without you''

980
01:38:09,613 --> 01:38:11,948
What happened?
- ls everything all right?

981
01:38:12,073 --> 01:38:17,495
Oh yes. l received a letter from
my wife and couldn't stop my tears

982
01:38:18,537 --> 01:38:21,916
''For the first time in 40 years,
we have been separated from each other''

983
01:38:23,542 --> 01:38:25,544
See? He's missing sister-in-law

984
01:38:28,839 --> 01:38:31,925
See how he misses his wife.
And look at you!

985
01:38:32,133 --> 01:38:35,553
''That's not true, darling. l shed tears
too, when l'm separated from you''

986
01:38:35,762 --> 01:38:38,180
Really?
- Tears of joy!

987
01:38:39,098 --> 01:38:40,975
Stop joking and learn
something from him

988
01:38:42,601 --> 01:38:45,979
Uncle Raj can miss his wife and cry
even after 40 years of marriage

989
01:38:46,271 --> 01:38:48,565
Will you also miss me
like this?

990
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:51,568
''Now look, children.
lf your love is true...''

991
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:55,613
it remains fresh and attractive
till you breathe your very last

992
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:59,992
''After listening to you, the kids have
forgotten about Romeo Juliet...''

993
01:39:00,659 --> 01:39:03,287
and become your fans.
- Oh yes. And they must too

994
01:39:03,662 --> 01:39:07,999
All the legendary lovers died
pining for their beloveds

995
01:39:08,625 --> 01:39:13,963
But our mota bhai has been living
with his beloved for 40 years

996
01:39:16,132 --> 01:39:17,842
The world ought to know
about this love story

997
01:39:18,592 --> 01:39:20,970
''You ought to write, Uncle.
- Yes! Why don't you write?''

998
01:39:25,641 --> 01:39:30,020
''Write about it, mota bhai...
- But l'm not a writer. l can't write!''

999
01:39:31,646 --> 01:39:34,023
At least try... try!

1000
01:40:09,347 --> 01:40:11,349
''The world ought to know
about this love story''

1001
01:40:11,724 --> 01:40:16,104
''You ought to write, Uncle.
- Yes! Why don't you write?''

1002
01:40:18,731 --> 01:40:22,693
''Write about it, mota bhai...
- You must! You must''

1003
01:40:56,807 --> 01:41:01,228
''Times of the past,
l think of...''

1004
01:41:01,854 --> 01:41:05,232
''whenever l'm alone''

1005
01:41:10,111 --> 01:41:14,115
''Silence speaks to me...''

1006
01:41:15,074 --> 01:41:19,120
''and l cry,
away from prying eyes''

1007
01:41:22,373 --> 01:41:27,169
''lt's ages since l have smiled''

1008
01:41:35,301 --> 01:41:38,763
''Tears are now my lot''

1009
01:41:45,602 --> 01:41:48,230
''You and l are separated...''

1010
01:41:51,191 --> 01:41:54,235
''what has life come to?''

1011
01:41:56,237 --> 01:42:01,200
''You are the only one l see,
everywhere l cast a glance, my love''

1012
01:42:03,869 --> 01:42:08,290
''Sleep eludes me,
l can't stop thinking about you''

1013
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:20,217
''Without you,
l cannot live anymore''

1014
01:42:50,954 --> 01:42:53,539
THE CARETAKER

1015
01:43:23,567 --> 01:43:27,320
''Payal, you're late again today?''

1016
01:43:33,076 --> 01:43:34,702
What happened?
Why're you yelling?

1017
01:43:35,328 --> 01:43:39,290
''Make it clear to your mother, daddy.
Ask her not to play mummy with me!''

1018
01:43:39,582 --> 01:43:41,292
She keeps taunting me
and intruding...

1019
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:45,921
''Payal, my child...
- Please be quiet''

1020
01:43:46,088 --> 01:43:48,965
And please stop interfering
in my personal life. Okay?

1021
01:43:50,175 --> 01:43:52,927
Why're you targetting
my poor daughter?

1022
01:43:53,136 --> 01:43:54,929
Payal is my daughter too...
- Mama!

1023
01:43:55,638 --> 01:43:57,640
We have enough troubles
in our lives already

1024
01:43:57,765 --> 01:43:59,350
Why're you creating more problems?

1025
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,602
l say it because there
ought not to be anymore problems

1026
01:44:02,978 --> 01:44:05,397
Payal is a girl...
- Times have changed

1027
01:44:06,023 --> 01:44:07,983
There's no difference
between men and women

1028
01:44:08,191 --> 01:44:10,151
Times never change for a woman

1029
01:44:12,028 --> 01:44:15,907
''lt was my duty to caution you,
and l did''

1030
01:44:16,449 --> 01:44:31,337
We know our duties! l beg you...
don't say anything to Payal again!

1031
01:44:53,024 --> 01:44:55,985
''Sanju... wake up, please''

1032
01:44:56,569 --> 01:44:59,447
What happened?
- You can drink and go to sleep

1033
01:44:59,572 --> 01:45:03,450
But what about me? Papa has hit upon
a new ruse to disturb me

1034
01:45:04,076 --> 01:45:06,453
''Go and ask him to stop
making that noise, please''

1035
01:45:06,578 --> 01:45:09,414
l've got to get up early and
do the chores. l need to sleep

1036
01:45:20,049 --> 01:45:22,384
Dad... what are you doing
in the middle of the night?

1037
01:45:23,052 --> 01:45:25,679
l couldn't go to sleep.
So l thought...

1038
01:45:26,054 --> 01:45:28,014
''You get less sleep
at this age anyway, dad''

1039
01:45:28,181 --> 01:45:30,392
But that doesn't mean you
won't let the others sleep

1040
01:45:31,559 --> 01:45:34,437
At least think about Reena.
She's the first to wake up...

1041
01:45:34,562 --> 01:45:36,439
get Rahul ready
and cook for all of us

1042
01:45:37,565 --> 01:45:41,443
Please... it would be nice
if you could think about her

1043
01:45:53,079 --> 01:45:55,081
God! He's going to get me
killed someday!

1044
01:45:58,084 --> 01:46:00,085
''Preetam!
- Yes, brother-in-law?''

1045
01:46:00,336 --> 01:46:02,463
''Come here, pipsqueak!
- Coming''

1046
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:07,092
Didn't l ask you to write the accounts?
- That's what l have done

1047
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,135
ls this the accounts
or a love-letter?

1048
01:46:09,219 --> 01:46:13,431
l will write just as much as l can!
- You know nothing... nothing!

1049
01:46:13,598 --> 01:46:15,433
Why're you yelling at him?

1050
01:46:16,058 --> 01:46:19,437
''Look at him. He's scolding me!
- Why're you scolding my Jittu, Hemant?''

1051
01:46:19,854 --> 01:46:23,023
Your Jittu's going to
drive me bankrupt some day!

1052
01:46:23,607 --> 01:46:26,443
ls this the accounts
or the will of a pauper?

1053
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:30,447
Where does he find the time?
The poor chap is busy all day

1054
01:46:30,613 --> 01:46:33,241
How will he find the time? He keeps
hovering around the girls' tables!

1055
01:46:36,119 --> 01:46:37,536
See? Wasn't he flying?

1056
01:46:38,162 --> 01:46:40,539
Who'll write the accounts now?
- Let me write it

1057
01:46:41,165 --> 01:46:43,083
l will! Mota bhai will

1058
01:46:44,793 --> 01:46:47,129
You will keep the accounts?
- Why? Can't l ?

1059
01:46:47,254 --> 01:46:50,757
''l'm your mota bhai, after all.
- True... but on one condition''

1060
01:46:51,174 --> 01:46:55,136
You will quietly accept
whatever l put in your pocket

1061
01:46:55,303 --> 01:46:58,139
''No, that's not happening. lmpossible.
- No...?''

1062
01:46:58,472 --> 01:47:01,517
So this is not happening either.
Let me go to prison

1063
01:47:01,684 --> 01:47:04,102
Makes no difference.
- All right. You win. l lose

1064
01:47:07,731 --> 01:47:10,567
A typewriter?
- Yes

1065
01:47:10,734 --> 01:47:13,069
l started writing at the
children's behest the other day

1066
01:47:13,486 --> 01:47:17,531
But l can't bring about the mood at
home. lf you don't mind the noise...

1067
01:47:18,157 --> 01:47:21,118
How can you say such a thing?

1068
01:47:21,368 --> 01:47:24,121
Do you think l call you mota bhai
only for effect?

1069
01:47:24,246 --> 01:47:27,541
lt comes from the depths of my heart.
Sit wherever you want to

1070
01:47:28,583 --> 01:47:30,543
''ls that place okay?
- Sure, go ahead''

1071
01:47:30,627 --> 01:47:33,129
Anywhere you wish to.
- lt's all yours

1072
01:47:33,838 --> 01:47:39,510
Keep punching away at the typewriter.
lt's as melodious as our music anyway

1073
01:47:40,219 --> 01:47:44,139
l'll get you some tea.
- Please add a dash of ginger

1074
01:47:45,224 --> 01:47:47,184
Wow! That's one step worse!

1075
01:47:47,309 --> 01:47:49,561
lt isn't worse...
it's for the better!

1076
01:47:53,523 --> 01:47:59,570
''She doesn't know, l deliberately
make mistakes in the proverbs''

1077
01:48:00,446 --> 01:48:05,617
''Whenever she corrects me,
there's a lovely glow on her face''

1078
01:48:06,243 --> 01:48:10,205
''For that glow, l can make mistakes
all my life, mota bhai''

1079
01:48:11,247 --> 01:48:12,874
Coming...
l'll be back

1080
01:48:15,209 --> 01:48:17,128
''You're lucky, Hemant bhai...''

1081
01:48:18,713 --> 01:48:22,549
your wife is with you
to correct you

1082
01:48:25,385 --> 01:48:30,557
''Pooja, l think of
your smiling face...''

1083
01:48:31,224 --> 01:48:33,226
''even as l try to
get on with my live''

1084
01:48:34,268 --> 01:48:36,229
''But your letter has made me cry''

1085
01:48:37,897 --> 01:48:40,900
''l do miss you...''

1086
01:48:41,734 --> 01:48:44,194
''but God has given me
some very good friends here''

1087
01:48:44,903 --> 01:48:48,198
''The husband and wife
run a cafe''

1088
01:48:48,782 --> 01:48:51,201
''l spend the day with them''

1089
01:48:51,785 --> 01:48:57,665
''But when it's time to go home,
my feet refuse to move''

1090
01:48:59,291 --> 01:49:02,252
''My heart just doesn't
feel like going there''

1091
01:49:03,295 --> 01:49:06,673
''After all, home is
where the heart is''

1092
01:49:07,299 --> 01:49:11,636
''And my heart is with you...
thousands of miles away''

1093
01:49:12,971 --> 01:49:17,600
''What else will l write to you?
We wanted to have our children's love...''

1094
01:49:18,267 --> 01:49:20,227
''but we have lost our own love''

1095
01:49:27,275 --> 01:49:30,653
''Papa, buy me a new pair of shoes.
This pair is so old''

1096
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:34,240
''All right, l'll buy a pair for you.
- Today!''

1097
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:37,243
''Hurry up, Rahul''

1098
01:49:42,289 --> 01:49:45,292
''Reena, l've given Rahul 1500 rupees
for a pair of shoes. Check the size''

1099
01:50:11,399 --> 01:50:14,027
Your Mummy's love-letter.
- From grandma!

1100
01:50:15,361 --> 01:50:17,321
Grandma's letter!

1101
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:23,911
Trouble-time

1102
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:28,331
''The glasses have broken.
- Sorry, grandpa''

1103
01:50:28,748 --> 01:50:32,335
''lt's okay, son. l'll tell your Papa
and he'll have it fixed''

1104
01:50:36,422 --> 01:50:40,843
''Sanju, my glasses have broken.
Will you have it fixed please?''

1105
01:50:40,926 --> 01:50:45,806
''l want to read your Mother's letter.
- lt isn't possible this month, dad''

1106
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:49,434
''End of the month, you see.
We're short of cash''

1107
01:50:51,478 --> 01:50:54,439
''But next month, l'll surely
have it fixed. l promise''

1108
01:50:56,482 --> 01:50:58,818
''Rahul, hurry up.
We're getting late''

1109
01:51:11,496 --> 01:51:14,791
Shanti darling! What have you cooked?
That's a lovely aroma

1110
01:51:14,957 --> 01:51:18,836
''You needn't be so happy. lt's not
for you, lt's for mota bhai''

1111
01:51:19,253 --> 01:51:21,422
Welcome... how are you?
- l'm okay

1112
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:23,841
''l have a bit of a bother
for you, Hemant-bhai''

1113
01:51:23,966 --> 01:51:26,843
Yes?
- l've received a letter from Pooja

1114
01:51:27,761 --> 01:51:32,432
My glasses broke today and
they can't be fixed immediately

1115
01:51:32,557 --> 01:51:35,810
''But l must read this letter at once
Will you read it for me, please?''

1116
01:51:35,977 --> 01:51:38,854
What's the big deal ? Come on

1117
01:51:49,489 --> 01:51:52,867
What happened?
- lt's in Hindi

1118
01:51:53,493 --> 01:51:55,453
But never mind.
When will my wife help?

1119
01:51:57,788 --> 01:52:00,457
lt's in Hindi!
- Coming

1120
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:05,003
lt's a letter from his wife.
How can l read it?

1121
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:07,923
Stop acting funny.
Mota bhai's so restless... read it

1122
01:52:08,548 --> 01:52:11,509
Now tell me something. Will you also
read my letter as...?

1123
01:52:11,843 --> 01:52:17,139
''No, may God never separate you...
He mustn't ever do this to you''

1124
01:52:18,974 --> 01:52:19,975
Read it

1125
01:52:23,312 --> 01:52:28,859
''You always say that
l make you cry with my letters''

1126
01:52:29,651 --> 01:52:32,237
''But you made me cry this time''

1127
01:52:32,529 --> 01:52:35,531
''Why did you write
that you have lost your love?''

1128
01:52:36,491 --> 01:52:40,452
''As long as you and l are alive,
how can our love ever be lost?''

1129
01:52:41,161 --> 01:52:42,538
''Never''

1130
01:52:49,586 --> 01:52:52,964
''Know what?
l hope you won't laugh''

1131
01:52:54,090 --> 01:52:56,968
''Earlier, whenever l used to
get ready before the mirror...''

1132
01:52:58,010 --> 01:53:00,971
''l always felt as if
you were watching me...''

1133
01:53:01,597 --> 01:53:05,934
''saying, ''The kohl looks very
nice in your eyes, Pooja''

1134
01:53:06,601 --> 01:53:08,937
''A blue-coloured sari
looks lovely on you''

1135
01:53:12,607 --> 01:53:16,152
''To be honest, l don't feel
like dressing up anymore''

1136
01:53:17,570 --> 01:53:19,947
''Whom will l dress for?''

1137
01:53:22,074 --> 01:53:23,575
''Who will look at me?''

1138
01:53:27,579 --> 01:53:30,957
''No, mota bhai...
l can't read anymore''

1139
01:53:33,835 --> 01:53:37,171
''When your glasses are fixed,
you can read it on your own''

1140
01:54:06,698 --> 01:54:10,618
''Hey! Who brought this? Daddy?
- No, l brought it''

1141
01:54:10,785 --> 01:54:12,996
Where did you get the money from?

1142
01:54:13,121 --> 01:54:14,956
Dad had given me money
for a pair of shoes

1143
01:54:15,123 --> 01:54:16,958
But l can manage with these
for another two months

1144
01:54:17,583 --> 01:54:19,543
''You've got to read
grandma's letter, isn't it?''

1145
01:54:19,752 --> 01:54:21,253
So go ahead. Don't feel shy!

1146
01:54:26,633 --> 01:54:30,595
''Away from you, l feel as if
l'm standing at a place...''

1147
01:54:31,179 --> 01:54:33,139
...that is plunged in darkness

1148
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:36,642
''There was neither a soothing voice,
Nor your comforting arms...''

1149
01:54:36,851 --> 01:54:39,645
Nor even sleep...
There was only anticipation

1150
01:54:40,062 --> 01:54:42,272
You are lying to me?
You're trying to cheat me?

1151
01:54:42,690 --> 01:54:44,650
One slap and you'll straighten out!

1152
01:54:44,733 --> 01:54:47,652
''ls this what you have learnt? Next
time you do this, l'll break your legs!''

1153
01:54:47,778 --> 01:54:50,030
''What happened, daughter-in-law?
- Please don't interfere''

1154
01:54:50,155 --> 01:54:54,033
He has got spoilt because of you.
He has started lying and cheating

1155
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,661
He spent the money of his shoes
on your glasses today

1156
01:54:56,994 --> 01:54:59,663
''Soon, he'll sell household
stuff for some need of yours''

1157
01:55:01,707 --> 01:55:02,624
Come with me!

1158
01:55:21,392 --> 01:55:23,644
''l have a small problem, brother.
- What happened?''

1159
01:55:23,727 --> 01:55:28,064
l brought those dogs here...
and they've run away today

1160
01:55:28,732 --> 01:55:31,901
So what should l do?
Must l inform mom and dad or...?

1161
01:55:32,735 --> 01:55:35,071
Why make an issue out of
something so trivial?

1162
01:55:35,196 --> 01:55:38,074
And where will they go anyway?
They've got to come back home

1163
01:56:04,765 --> 01:56:07,184
What's all this for?

1164
01:56:07,809 --> 01:56:10,562
''Today's a special day, Uncle.
lt's Valentine's Day''

1165
01:56:10,812 --> 01:56:13,690
''What's that?
- Let me explain, mota bhai''

1166
01:56:14,232 --> 01:56:19,695
''On Valentine's Day, boys lie
to girls that ''l love you''

1167
01:56:19,904 --> 01:56:22,698
What rubbish!
- Why're you getting angry?

1168
01:56:22,906 --> 01:56:25,075
You're not my girlfriend.
You're my wife already

1169
01:56:27,744 --> 01:56:29,746
The boy sinks with the life!

1170
01:56:30,747 --> 01:56:32,749
''That life is saved,
means millions are earned...''

1171
01:56:33,458 --> 01:56:35,376
''and the mole sinks the ship''

1172
01:56:36,627 --> 01:56:38,129
You ought to call aunty today.
- No

1173
01:56:38,295 --> 01:56:39,713
''Oh yes, you must!''

1174
01:56:50,807 --> 01:56:53,268
''What's Pooja, Pooja...?
Say something more''

1175
01:56:53,476 --> 01:56:55,478
What...?
- Anything!

1176
01:56:59,982 --> 01:57:04,194
''Look at you! For 40 years,
l've been only your Valentine''

1177
01:57:04,820 --> 01:57:09,199
''That's not happening. l asked you in
English, so reply to me in English''

1178
01:57:58,369 --> 01:58:01,247
''They're blowing again...''

1179
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,961
''the winds of love
are blowing again''

1180
01:58:11,965 --> 01:58:14,801
''They're blowing again...''

1181
01:58:15,259 --> 01:58:18,179
''the winds of love
are blowing again''

1182
01:58:42,910 --> 01:58:47,873
''l have a crazy heart...''

1183
01:58:49,958 --> 01:58:52,877
''it looks for my beloved
in every lane and street''

1184
01:58:53,419 --> 01:58:56,297
''They're blowing again...''

1185
01:58:56,422 --> 01:58:59,300
''the winds of love
are blowing again''

1186
01:59:36,959 --> 01:59:39,920
''Shirins, Lailas...''

1187
01:59:40,629 --> 01:59:43,298
''Majnus and Chhailas...''

1188
01:59:54,976 --> 01:59:57,937
''be he a lover or king...''

1189
01:59:58,312 --> 02:00:01,357
''the excitement of love
grips every heart''

1190
02:00:02,024 --> 02:00:04,943
''They're blowing again...''

1191
02:00:05,068 --> 02:00:08,405
''the winds of love
are blowing again''

1192
02:00:45,939 --> 02:00:48,441
''l shall forever love you...''

1193
02:00:49,109 --> 02:00:52,070
''not for a moment
can l forget you''

1194
02:01:03,622 --> 02:01:06,500
''ln love with you,
l have spent my days...''

1195
02:01:06,625 --> 02:01:09,502
''my heart has longed for you''

1196
02:01:10,545 --> 02:01:13,423
''They're blowing again...''

1197
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:16,467
''the winds of love
are blowing again''

1198
02:02:13,644 --> 02:02:16,021
What's the venue?
Resort or Retreat?

1199
02:02:19,066 --> 02:02:23,028
''Where are you going all alone?
That too, dressed like this?''

1200
02:02:23,653 --> 02:02:28,324
So you've taunted me again?
You'll never give up your stunts!

1201
02:02:28,658 --> 02:02:29,784
You've ruined my mood!

1202
02:02:42,003 --> 02:02:44,673
''There's mischief,
there's charm...''

1203
02:02:45,215 --> 02:02:48,092
''there is the high of youthfulness''

1204
02:02:49,761 --> 02:02:52,096
''Come into my arms...''

1205
02:02:52,763 --> 02:02:55,724
''and see how
l have been pining''

1206
02:02:56,016 --> 02:02:59,102
''They're blowing again...''

1207
02:02:59,228 --> 02:03:02,105
''the winds of love
are blowing again''

1208
02:03:02,981 --> 02:03:06,109
''My crazy heart...''

1209
02:03:09,737 --> 02:03:13,115
''looks for my beloved
in every lane and street''

1210
02:03:40,766 --> 02:03:46,104
First you set my blood on fire
by wearing those skimpy dresses...

1211
02:03:47,855 --> 02:03:49,524
you keep giving me
those inviting looks...

1212
02:03:51,192 --> 02:03:54,445
and then you pretend to be
the touch-me-nots

1213
02:03:57,781 --> 02:03:59,449
Old hag!

1214
02:04:07,582 --> 02:04:11,794
What did you think? She's a tramp?
There's no one to take care of her?

1215
02:04:12,211 --> 02:04:14,130
You think you can get her
into your clutches...

1216
02:04:14,255 --> 02:04:18,092
by giving her a ride in your car?
You think you can do anything to her?

1217
02:04:18,759 --> 02:04:24,723
lf l see you around our house ever
again or see you looking at Payal...

1218
02:04:24,931 --> 02:04:28,142
l'll gorge your eyes out!
l'll have you sent to jail!

1219
02:04:28,518 --> 02:04:29,894
She's my daughter

1220
02:04:51,831 --> 02:04:55,793
This is the limit!
lt's 3 and Payal hasn't returned yet

1221
02:04:56,877 --> 02:04:58,795
She's never so late

1222
02:04:59,171 --> 02:05:01,840
''Did you try her mobile?
- l did, it's switched off''

1223
02:05:03,883 --> 02:05:05,802
There she is

1224
02:05:12,183 --> 02:05:13,184
''Mummy, you...?''

1225
02:05:13,392 --> 02:05:16,186
And Payal...
- Actually Kiran...

1226
02:05:16,854 --> 02:05:20,190
l had heard about Valentine's Day.
But since l am in Bombay...

1227
02:05:20,315 --> 02:05:22,817
l thought l'd check what
it's really all about

1228
02:05:23,068 --> 02:05:25,487
l told Payal to take me out

1229
02:05:25,820 --> 02:05:27,989
''But you should've looked
at the time, Payal''

1230
02:05:28,281 --> 02:05:33,202
''lt's not her mistake, son.
She wanted to return early''

1231
02:05:33,869 --> 02:05:36,538
But l insisted that we enjoy
for a little while more

1232
02:05:36,580 --> 02:05:39,249
''Hear that?
- This is amazing, Mama!''

1233
02:05:39,875 --> 02:05:43,837
You're worried about enjoyment
and it has ruined our sleep!

1234
02:05:44,045 --> 02:05:47,257
l told Kiran to go to bed.
But how could she get any sleep?

1235
02:05:47,382 --> 02:05:51,219
''She's a mother, after all.
- Why would your mother worry about us?''

1236
02:05:51,886 --> 02:05:54,221
She has only her fun to pursue

1237
02:05:54,472 --> 02:05:58,267
And you were lecturing me to
keep my family under control!

1238
02:05:58,392 --> 02:06:00,894
So where's your discipline?

1239
02:06:01,061 --> 02:06:05,273
Neither is your mom worried about her
age nor the respect of this family

1240
02:06:10,945 --> 02:06:12,321
''Come on, grandma''

1241
02:06:30,421 --> 02:06:35,843
Grandma... l'm a very bad girl.
l'm terrible

1242
02:06:36,927 --> 02:06:40,305
''l always nursed contempt for you,
But you gave me only love.''

1243
02:06:40,972 --> 02:06:45,310
''My child, you don't keep track of
what you give and take in love''

1244
02:06:46,686 --> 02:06:47,895
Love is to be given and l...

1245
02:06:51,983 --> 02:06:54,318
l love you very dearly

1246
02:07:08,456 --> 02:07:10,833
Here you are to enjoy
the early dawn meal!

1247
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:15,837
''l've explained to you several times
that this fast of ''Karva Chauth''...''

1248
02:07:15,962 --> 02:07:19,841
is meant for women and you...
- Listen... listen...

1249
02:07:19,966 --> 02:07:21,843
Why do you women observe
this fast?

1250
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:25,846
So that we can have our husbands
for seven births

1251
02:07:25,930 --> 02:07:28,808
All right. And l
observe this fast...

1252
02:07:29,934 --> 02:07:34,438
so that you will meet me
every time l am born

1253
02:07:37,482 --> 02:07:39,442
''l won't improve, l know''

1254
02:07:41,027 --> 02:07:43,821
''Here you are, mota bhai.
Tea with a dash of ginger''

1255
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:45,865
''No, sis. l'm fasting today''

1256
02:07:46,032 --> 02:07:47,867
l'll have something only after
l've seen the Moon

1257
02:07:48,492 --> 02:07:51,870
Today's my fast too. Karva Chauth.
- Mine too

1258
02:07:52,204 --> 02:07:54,873
Yours...? You too...?
- Yes

1259
02:07:55,499 --> 02:08:00,336
For sister-in-law...?
Hemant...

1260
02:08:03,548 --> 02:08:05,508
''l'm dying of hunger, Sanju''

1261
02:08:05,841 --> 02:08:08,928
''Don't talk of dying, love...
let's go and eat''

1262
02:08:09,553 --> 02:08:11,930
But you said we were going out!
l haven't cooked anything

1263
02:08:12,014 --> 02:08:13,891
Don't be angry.
Let's go out

1264
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:16,852
What will grandpa eat?

1265
02:08:18,186 --> 02:08:21,648
''Whenever he returns after nine,
he already eats at the cafe''

1266
02:08:24,901 --> 02:08:27,486
''The Moon is out, mota-bhai.
l've done my ritual...''

1267
02:08:27,653 --> 02:08:29,488
so take a look at the Moon
and l'll serve the dinner

1268
02:08:29,697 --> 02:08:33,909
''No, Shanti-behn. Pooja must be
trying to telephone me at home''

1269
02:08:34,034 --> 02:08:35,911
Let me first talk to her.
l'll eat later

1270
02:08:42,834 --> 02:08:46,837
My respects!
- May we always be there for each other

1271
02:08:47,963 --> 02:08:49,757
''You saw the Moon?
- Yes, l did''

1272
02:08:50,591 --> 02:08:51,967
Did you drink some water?

1273
02:08:58,265 --> 02:08:59,682
What are you looking at?

1274
02:08:59,891 --> 02:09:01,809
''You look at your Moon,
l'll look at mine''

1275
02:09:02,101 --> 02:09:04,103
''And hurry up, please.
My throat's drying of thirst''

1276
02:09:04,896 --> 02:09:07,231
How can l drink any water
unless l've seen my Moon?

1277
02:09:08,691 --> 02:09:12,361
''This year, l just didn't get
to see my Moon''

1278
02:09:13,612 --> 02:09:15,530
Will you only keep talking?

1279
02:09:18,867 --> 02:09:21,911
lmagine l'm with you

1280
02:09:23,579 --> 02:09:25,957
Go on. Have some water

1281
02:09:26,582 --> 02:09:27,958
All right. Hold on

1282
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:37,259
l've had water

1283
02:09:41,012 --> 02:09:43,556
l've had some too

1284
02:09:44,015 --> 02:09:46,726
Now have something to eat

1285
02:09:47,601 --> 02:09:48,978
Wait

1286
02:10:36,730 --> 02:10:39,858
What a plate-full of food!

1287
02:10:40,733 --> 02:10:42,485
What has your daughter-in-law
prepared today?

1288
02:10:42,735 --> 02:10:49,116
''What's this...? Potatoes.
Cauliflower, peas and cottage cheese''

1289
02:10:52,744 --> 02:10:56,706
And this is yogurt raita
and laddoos

1290
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:00,460
There are jalebis and puris too!

1291
02:11:01,169 --> 02:11:07,133
Let me break a piece of puri
and put it in my mouth

1292
02:11:11,512 --> 02:11:13,180
Fantastic!

1293
02:11:15,724 --> 02:11:17,142
Excellent food!

1294
02:11:19,728 --> 02:11:23,147
You can't even tell a lie

1295
02:11:28,777 --> 02:11:30,112
You will never improve

1296
02:11:32,781 --> 02:11:33,865
Never

1297
02:11:55,510 --> 02:11:57,179
''Excuse me, sir...
- Yes?''

1298
02:11:57,345 --> 02:11:59,180
Your mother is here.
May l send her in?

1299
02:12:02,350 --> 02:12:04,811
''No, serve her some tea.
l'll be coming out''

1300
02:12:07,980 --> 02:12:11,859
How often have l told you not to
bring family fights into my office?

1301
02:12:12,067 --> 02:12:15,779
And that's just what has happened.
What's Mama doing here?

1302
02:12:15,946 --> 02:12:17,405
l'm sick of all this!

1303
02:12:17,656 --> 02:12:19,366
''l'll have a word with her, okay?''

1304
02:12:27,373 --> 02:12:30,167
l know it. There must be something
cooking between mother and son

1305
02:12:33,795 --> 02:12:35,797
They must be badmouthing me

1306
02:12:39,843 --> 02:12:41,803
''Kiran, l had not gone there
to badmouth you''

1307
02:12:41,886 --> 02:12:46,265
Don't try to act innocent
What do you want...?

1308
02:12:46,390 --> 02:12:49,268
Why're you bent on ruining the
peace and happiness of my family?

1309
02:12:49,393 --> 02:12:52,813
''That's just what l come to ask,
leaving all my work in the office''

1310
02:12:53,021 --> 02:12:56,858
''lf you had any doubts, couldn't you
have waited for me to come back home?''

1311
02:12:56,983 --> 02:12:59,235
Where was the need
to come to my office?

1312
02:12:59,903 --> 02:13:02,155
l've asked you a question.
Answer me

1313
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:03,322
Why don't you speak?

1314
02:13:03,906 --> 02:13:06,242
lt was the mother in me
that took me there

1315
02:13:08,285 --> 02:13:13,248
This almond halwa...
you have always loved it

1316
02:13:14,875 --> 02:13:18,837
''On every birthday of yours,
l have prepared it for you''

1317
02:13:21,214 --> 02:13:24,842
And today is your birthday

1318
02:13:26,886 --> 02:13:31,849
''l prepared the halwa this morning,
but you left early for the office''

1319
02:13:32,891 --> 02:13:35,268
l thought l'd go after you

1320
02:13:36,895 --> 02:13:41,858
How was l to know that my love
would prove to be my crime?

1321
02:13:43,276 --> 02:13:47,238
So you want to prove that only
you remember his birthday?

1322
02:13:47,405 --> 02:13:50,240
l had made all the arrangements
to give him a surprise

1323
02:13:50,616 --> 02:13:53,243
But you've ruined all my efforts!

1324
02:13:55,954 --> 02:13:58,915
''You've made her cry, haven't you?
Are you happy now?''

1325
02:14:00,959 --> 02:14:03,294
You can see her crying...

1326
02:14:03,961 --> 02:14:09,341
''but your mother's tears,
her love and affection...?''

1327
02:14:09,967 --> 02:14:11,927
can't you see anything
of that at all?

1328
02:14:14,304 --> 02:14:18,266
There's no point in asking you
this question

1329
02:14:18,892 --> 02:14:22,270
Because you have forgotten
that you are my son

1330
02:14:24,188 --> 02:14:28,275
But l will always remember
that l am your mother

1331
02:14:34,323 --> 02:14:36,658
''Sister-in-law, Karan here.
- Yes, Karan?''

1332
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:38,952
''ls Rohit there?
- Yes, one moment''

1333
02:14:39,035 --> 02:14:40,411
lt's a call from Karan

1334
02:14:45,374 --> 02:14:46,959
''Yes, Karan? What's up?''

1335
02:14:47,084 --> 02:14:51,964
''What else, brother? l called to
remind you that six months are up''

1336
02:14:52,131 --> 02:14:54,758
lt's our turn now to
welcome mom and dad

1337
02:14:55,967 --> 02:14:59,387
''Karan, what are you
reminding me for?''

1338
02:15:02,098 --> 02:15:04,725
This is just what is causing
fights in my family every day

1339
02:15:08,521 --> 02:15:11,482
Pooja...?
- You? My respects

1340
02:15:12,525 --> 02:15:15,444
How are you?
You've called after so many days

1341
02:15:15,778 --> 02:15:17,863
''You're keeping well, l hope?
- Yes, l'm okay...''

1342
02:15:17,946 --> 02:15:20,324
''l was a bit ill for a few days,
but l'm all right now''

1343
02:15:20,949 --> 02:15:24,828
l know why you must've taken ill.
You must've had something cold to drink...

1344
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:27,705
and not taken care.
You mustn't have taken your medicines

1345
02:15:27,789 --> 02:15:31,125
l've told you so often...
- Won't you let me say something?

1346
02:15:31,542 --> 02:15:33,461
Now listen...

1347
02:15:33,794 --> 02:15:35,838
What's the day after tomorrow?
- Our wedding anniversary

1348
02:15:36,005 --> 02:15:38,465
''Yes, our wedding anniversary.
Wouldn't you like to meet me?''

1349
02:15:38,590 --> 02:15:40,884
Now listen carefully.
l'll explain

1350
02:15:41,218 --> 02:15:44,471
You and l are leaving our
respective places tomorrow

1351
02:15:44,679 --> 02:15:49,892
''ln a matter of five minutes, our trains
will cross the Vijaynagar Station''

1352
02:15:50,518 --> 02:15:53,479
Whoever gets there first will
get down and wait for the other

1353
02:15:53,854 --> 02:15:55,481
But...
- No buts!

1354
02:15:55,689 --> 02:15:57,900
''We're meeting the day after.
Just wait for me, okay?''

1355
02:16:19,336 --> 02:16:20,295
Grandpa...

1356
02:16:29,554 --> 02:16:31,514
May l say something?

1357
02:16:32,515 --> 02:16:33,933
''Sure, go ahead, son''

1358
02:16:34,558 --> 02:16:36,518
Don't come back here ever again

1359
02:17:00,999 --> 02:17:04,961
What's this?
- A small gift for you

1360
02:17:23,061 --> 02:17:24,771
''l must leave now, Hemant-bhai''

1361
02:17:25,605 --> 02:17:27,774
''lf it wasn't for you, what would
l do with my loneliness?''

1362
02:17:28,608 --> 02:17:31,193
Thank you... thank you very much

1363
02:17:31,611 --> 02:17:33,195
Don't say that

1364
02:17:35,489 --> 02:17:37,366
You're the one who says such things

1365
02:17:38,617 --> 02:17:42,746
You don't realise what you have
given me. l found an elder brother

1366
02:17:43,413 --> 02:17:45,957
You know what that means?
lt means shelter

1367
02:17:46,374 --> 02:17:49,210
''And only he who does not have
shelter, realises what it means''

1368
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:51,963
Here you are...

1369
02:17:52,463 --> 02:17:53,422
What...?
- No way!

1370
02:17:53,672 --> 02:17:57,301
l know you're a proud man who will
not accept any charity...

1371
02:17:57,676 --> 02:18:01,054
but this is your hard-earned money.
You have maintained our accounts...

1372
02:18:01,430 --> 02:18:04,057
and this is the payment.
Go away now...

1373
02:18:04,432 --> 02:18:07,185
''or l won't let you go,
if you stay another minute''

1374
02:19:19,876 --> 02:19:23,213
People are watching...
- Let them watch

1375
02:19:24,506 --> 02:19:26,132
What will they say?

1376
02:19:26,549 --> 02:19:29,177
''They'll say, although we're old,
our love is still going strong''

1377
02:19:30,761 --> 02:19:37,184
''Pooja, these six months without you
were spent like six lifetimes''

1378
02:19:38,894 --> 02:19:40,854
l had forgotten what
it means to breathe

1379
02:19:43,690 --> 02:19:49,695
See? One look at you
and my heart is beating again

1380
02:19:51,739 --> 02:19:53,949
You could teach them a lesson
or two in playing with words

1381
02:19:54,366 --> 02:19:56,910
''Not just words,
about love too''

1382
02:19:59,788 --> 02:20:01,748
Congratulations on our
wedding anniversary

1383
02:20:02,624 --> 02:20:04,292
To you too

1384
02:20:04,626 --> 02:20:07,587
But l have nothing to
give you today

1385
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:10,590
''You do, Pooja.
Only you have it''

1386
02:20:11,591 --> 02:20:16,345
Take back the oath that compelled
us to live away from each other

1387
02:20:17,304 --> 02:20:21,600
''Tied in the oath, we have suffered
for six months. Release me of the oath''

1388
02:20:23,893 --> 02:20:25,228
There you are

1389
02:20:26,646 --> 02:20:27,605
C'mon

1390
02:20:28,898 --> 02:20:32,360
Over there. The waiting room.
- What will we do in the waiting room?

1391
02:20:32,735 --> 02:20:34,987
''We'll leave our luggage there,
go out for a walk...''

1392
02:20:35,362 --> 02:20:37,281
and celebrate.
- Celebrate?

1393
02:20:37,656 --> 02:20:42,202
You forget...? What does the sign say?
- Vijaynagar

1394
02:20:42,577 --> 02:20:48,624
This is the city here we had started
our lives together. C'mon

1395
02:20:49,917 --> 02:20:53,254
But our trains...?
- We'll think about it later. Come

1396
02:20:57,857 --> 02:21:00,527
''Karan, where have you been? l've been
trying to reach you since this morning''

1397
02:21:00,902 --> 02:21:05,072
But there was no trace of you!
Has Mummy reached there?

1398
02:21:05,489 --> 02:21:08,451
Where has she come? l've been
to the station thrice already

1399
02:21:08,868 --> 02:21:11,245
l don't know where she has gone.
But has dad come there?

1400
02:21:11,578 --> 02:21:14,122
No. And that is why l'm so upset

1401
02:21:14,831 --> 02:21:17,792
l called Ajay and Sanjay's place.
The two of them have left

1402
02:21:18,209 --> 02:21:20,920
l wonder where they've gone.
They are really...

1403
02:21:21,254 --> 02:21:25,841
Forget it. Trouble avoided in
my house for at least a day

1404
02:21:30,766 --> 02:21:33,102
''Today you will
wear a tie, won't you?''

1405
02:21:35,729 --> 02:21:38,732
''No, l will have it put on''

1406
02:21:45,321 --> 02:21:46,948
''For this very moment, l...''

1407
02:22:44,918 --> 02:22:51,799
''To the gardens
you have brought the Spring...''

1408
02:22:54,593 --> 02:22:59,598
''the climes are no longer deprived''

1409
02:23:00,807 --> 02:23:07,689
''My search of many lifetimes
ends here''

1410
02:23:11,859 --> 02:23:16,822
''Moments of separation
are past''

1411
02:23:17,948 --> 02:23:22,994
''The Caretaker dreams dreams
that were once shattered''

1412
02:23:37,716 --> 02:23:42,637
''God is the Caretaker...''

1413
02:23:59,074 --> 02:24:00,492
''Shanti, come on...''

1414
02:24:04,663 --> 02:24:08,291
''You're crying?
- Yes, l'm crying''

1415
02:24:08,708 --> 02:24:10,919
''When you read this,
you will also cry''

1416
02:24:11,252 --> 02:24:13,045
What's written in that?

1417
02:24:13,629 --> 02:24:17,174
''lt isn't written, Hemant.
He has poured his heart out''

1418
02:24:19,969 --> 02:24:25,682
''To be honest, only a man who can
starve for his wife, can write this...''

1419
02:24:26,308 --> 02:24:28,518
a man who can fall ill
thinking about her

1420
02:24:28,852 --> 02:24:30,645
Only he can write it

1421
02:24:36,567 --> 02:24:39,737
''When you expect,
you don't find love''

1422
02:24:40,362 --> 02:24:43,198
When you get so much of it at a place
you least expect it from...

1423
02:24:43,532 --> 02:24:46,493
you don't know how to handle it.
- l must say something

1424
02:24:48,411 --> 02:24:50,330
One must never pin hopes on anyone

1425
02:24:51,372 --> 02:24:53,541
''When hopes are dashed,
it causes a lot of agony''

1426
02:24:55,584 --> 02:24:58,087
True. So what now?

1427
02:24:59,588 --> 02:25:04,343
''Let's go to the station, pick up our
luggage and head for our destination''

1428
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:06,595
''Yes, that's what we will do''

1429
02:25:07,512 --> 02:25:09,597
''Go to the station,
pick up our luggage...''

1430
02:25:10,890 --> 02:25:14,393
and head not for two different
destinations. Only one

1431
02:25:17,563 --> 02:25:21,817
''Except death, no power can
separate us now''

1432
02:25:22,359 --> 02:25:24,695
We will live together

1433
02:25:25,695 --> 02:25:27,572
But where will we go?

1434
02:25:28,406 --> 02:25:30,116
Wherever life takes us

1435
02:25:32,327 --> 02:25:34,162
''Over there, right now''

1436
02:25:36,539 --> 02:25:39,625
To have an ice-cream?
- l've worn a tie after months

1437
02:25:40,042 --> 02:25:41,752
So let me sweeten my tongue

1438
02:25:44,629 --> 02:25:46,923
l have a nice round cone

1439
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:56,390
What are you looking at?

1440
02:25:57,475 --> 02:25:59,602
lt's a dream that was
never fulfilled

1441
02:26:00,019 --> 02:26:03,272
When we had just got married...

1442
02:26:03,689 --> 02:26:08,276
l had dreams of owning a car.
That l'd return from the office...

1443
02:26:08,693 --> 02:26:11,321
''honking away at the gate,
and you'd come running down...''

1444
02:26:11,696 --> 02:26:16,075
''l'd take you by the hand and
we'd go on a long, long drive''

1445
02:26:16,450 --> 02:26:19,912
That we'd stop somewhere and have
some snacks and ice-creams...

1446
02:26:21,705 --> 02:26:25,167
but our dreams remained unfulfilled
in trying to fulfill our childrens'

1447
02:26:25,625 --> 02:26:27,127
But never mind

1448
02:26:28,086 --> 02:26:30,004
What do you think of the car?
- We don't want to buy it

1449
02:26:30,380 --> 02:26:32,340
We were only taking a look.
- Sir. l'll give you its catalogue...

1450
02:26:32,757 --> 02:26:35,426
''with the features. Please come.
- l told you, mister''

1451
02:26:35,801 --> 02:26:37,970
We don't want to buy a car.
- Why not take a test drive?

1452
02:26:41,473 --> 02:26:43,433
''Try it, sir.
- How about it?''

1453
02:27:12,543 --> 02:27:17,047
''So what you think about the car, sir?
- lt's a wonderful car''

1454
02:27:17,423 --> 02:27:19,425
lt's really very nice.
- So let's go inside

1455
02:27:19,758 --> 02:27:23,095
l'll give you more information...
- l have already told you

1456
02:27:23,428 --> 02:27:26,139
''We don't wish to buy the car.
Honestly, l can't buy it''

1457
02:27:26,473 --> 02:27:31,185
''A car is no big deal nowadays, sir.
Think about it, and you have the keys''

1458
02:27:31,561 --> 02:27:34,897
l'll try and arrange a loan for you...
- You're forcing yourself on us!

1459
02:27:35,273 --> 02:27:39,526
''l told you, we don't want the car.
We don't have the money to buy it''

1460
02:27:39,943 --> 02:27:43,572
''ln that case, why did you sit
in such an expensive car?''

1461
02:27:43,947 --> 02:27:46,199
Get going... get lost!
- Hey... what are you doing...?

1462
02:27:47,826 --> 02:27:51,371
''What misbehaviour is this, mister...?
- Father...''

1463
02:27:55,833 --> 02:27:57,501
My son! You...?
- My respects

1464
02:27:57,835 --> 02:27:59,295
When did you arrive?

1465
02:27:59,837 --> 02:28:01,088
One second

1466
02:28:02,005 --> 02:28:04,091
''Alok, listen to me...''

1467
02:28:05,842 --> 02:28:07,594
You know whom you just pushed?

1468
02:28:08,887 --> 02:28:11,931
''lt was my father!
- Let him go, my son''

1469
02:28:19,730 --> 02:28:21,231
Where have the two of you been?

1470
02:28:21,607 --> 02:28:23,775
''Ever since l've arrived in lndia,
l made so many phone calls...''

1471
02:28:24,151 --> 02:28:27,237
but they were not answered.
l couldn't take it

1472
02:28:27,654 --> 02:28:30,281
''So l went to your house,
but l found it locked''

1473
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:34,827
Even Uncle's house was locked.
l got terribly scared

1474
02:28:35,745 --> 02:28:38,080
l used to make a call every
morning and evening...

1475
02:28:38,455 --> 02:28:42,626
and pray to God to take me
to my father and my mother

1476
02:28:43,043 --> 02:28:46,504
God has listened to my prayers.
You must come home with me

1477
02:28:46,922 --> 02:28:50,425
Someone's waiting for you
- All right. Let's go

1478
02:29:02,186 --> 02:29:04,187
l'm coming... what is it?

1479
02:29:05,689 --> 02:29:08,191
The gods you worship every day...
l've brought them with me

1480
02:29:13,696 --> 02:29:16,073
My respects.
- May you be happy forever

1481
02:29:16,407 --> 02:29:19,118
You took so much of time
to give me your blessings

1482
02:29:20,661 --> 02:29:23,372
We had everything here...
but it still felt so incomplete

1483
02:29:24,915 --> 02:29:28,335
You have given me everything today.
My family is complete

1484
02:29:31,337 --> 02:29:33,214
What?
- The customary gift

1485
02:29:43,765 --> 02:29:45,267
''Here you are, dear...''

1486
02:29:45,642 --> 02:29:47,435
it's a customary gift. Keep it

1487
02:29:48,061 --> 02:29:50,522
Take it. lt's God's gift

1488
02:29:50,980 --> 02:29:53,274
Our parents are so irresponsible

1489
02:29:54,150 --> 02:29:58,279
We're worried sick and he's
just not bothered about us

1490
02:29:58,654 --> 02:30:01,949
What is it with him...?
He has nothing to do anyway

1491
02:30:02,741 --> 02:30:05,243
But we're employees. How long can we
take days off like this?

1492
02:30:06,077 --> 02:30:09,873
Enough now. How long can we wait?
They'll come back when they want to

1493
02:30:10,206 --> 02:30:12,166
''Mother, father...
dinner is ready''

1494
02:30:12,959 --> 02:30:16,921
''You ought to have called me, dear.
l was doing nothing''

1495
02:30:17,338 --> 02:30:19,715
Why must you work when your
daughter-in-law is around?

1496
02:30:20,090 --> 02:30:21,341
Please sit down

1497
02:30:21,758 --> 02:30:24,136
''Here, father. Please sit here''

1498
02:30:24,761 --> 02:30:27,389
''But that chair is meant
for the head of the family, son''

1499
02:30:27,764 --> 02:30:29,474
''That's you, father''

1500
02:30:29,974 --> 02:30:33,519
''Papa, that's Sanju's chair.
Please sit in the other chair''

1501
02:30:37,773 --> 02:30:39,400
You are the pride of this family

1502
02:30:39,775 --> 02:30:42,611
This house and this chair have been
waiting for you for four months

1503
02:30:42,986 --> 02:30:44,613
''And you will sit here, mother''

1504
02:30:44,988 --> 02:30:47,449
Because l can't bear to see
the two of you sitting apart

1505
02:30:51,995 --> 02:30:56,957
''No, Shanti. They haven't come to
ask us where their parents are''

1506
02:30:57,833 --> 02:31:01,295
They've only come to find out
whether they're alive or dead!

1507
02:31:02,004 --> 02:31:04,673
''lf they're dead, who will
have them cremated?''

1508
02:31:05,006 --> 02:31:08,426
''And if they're unfortunately alive,
who will have them treated!''

1509
02:31:08,802 --> 02:31:10,970
Hemant-bhai...
- Please!

1510
02:31:11,387 --> 02:31:16,684
Please don't call me bhai (brother ).
Don't try to forge a relation with me

1511
02:31:17,143 --> 02:31:21,230
''The one you shared a blood relation
with, you drove to shed tears of blood''

1512
02:31:21,688 --> 02:31:23,732
That poor man used to hide there
and weep in misery

1513
02:31:24,149 --> 02:31:27,319
Listen to us...
- Please go away

1514
02:31:28,820 --> 02:31:32,281
''lf you weren't mota bhai's sons,
l'd have had you thrown out''

1515
02:31:34,033 --> 02:31:37,995
You have committed a sin by
separating your parents at this age

1516
02:31:38,787 --> 02:31:42,332
''Maybe God will forgive you for that,
but Hemant never will''

1517
02:31:43,750 --> 02:31:46,419
Remember...
you have made your parents cry

1518
02:31:46,836 --> 02:31:49,047
''One day, your children
will make you weep''

1519
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:10,066
''How they harassed mota bhai, Shanti''

1520
02:32:12,193 --> 02:32:15,071
lf this is how children are...

1521
02:32:15,863 --> 02:32:22,703
l'm glad we don't have any children.
We don't want any... we don't

1522
02:32:54,106 --> 02:32:57,818
Let all that be. We must set out
immediately to look for mota bhai

1523
02:32:58,194 --> 02:33:00,863
''That's all right,
but where will we go?''

1524
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:03,824
One minute... maybe he
has gone to his house

1525
02:33:04,199 --> 02:33:06,243
''His house?
- Yes, his old house''

1526
02:33:06,576 --> 02:33:09,913
l saw the address in his file.
- So where is the file?

1527
02:33:10,371 --> 02:33:12,498
Kapil and Nili took the file away
to read the manuscripts

1528
02:33:12,915 --> 02:33:16,711
So ring them up and send for the file.
- That isn't just a file anymore

1529
02:33:17,044 --> 02:33:18,003
Who's that?

1530
02:33:18,254 --> 02:33:20,756
lt's about to become
a beautiful book

1531
02:33:21,131 --> 02:33:24,092
''Uncle, this is my Papa.
- Oh... hello''

1532
02:33:35,102 --> 02:33:38,689
''You are our father, our mother...''

1533
02:33:39,148 --> 02:33:42,568
''who else will l seek
shelter in?''

1534
02:33:48,281 --> 02:33:55,162
''There is no one except You, Lord...''

1535
02:33:56,205 --> 02:33:59,792
''on whom l pin my hopes''

1536
02:34:01,001 --> 02:34:05,172
''Glory be to You, Lord''

1537
02:34:15,222 --> 02:34:17,099
Father...? Mother...?

1538
02:34:19,184 --> 02:34:21,603
''Are the two of you going out somewhere?
- No, Arpita''

1539
02:34:22,020 --> 02:34:23,814
lt's an old habit with father

1540
02:34:24,189 --> 02:34:27,150
''He bathes and gets ready
every morning. Right, father?''

1541
02:34:27,942 --> 02:34:32,405
''Yes, son. But it has to do with
necessity today, not with my habit''

1542
02:34:32,780 --> 02:34:35,157
''lt's time for our train, son.
- Train...?''

1543
02:34:37,993 --> 02:34:39,745
''Where are you going, father?''

1544
02:34:41,997 --> 02:34:45,167
''We're going home, son.
- But this is your house too, father''

1545
02:34:46,209 --> 02:34:50,171
''Yes, father.
l've always had a dream''

1546
02:34:51,005 --> 02:34:54,508
Of a small house...
where my parents are with me

1547
02:34:55,009 --> 02:34:58,721
l want to live the dream
l could never fulfill till today

1548
02:35:02,057 --> 02:35:06,228
''That will surely happen, son.
But we've got to leave now''

1549
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:10,064
We've got to pick up
the threads in life

1550
02:35:10,481 --> 02:35:14,944
''Father... for a few days, please.
Mother, please tell him''

1551
02:35:16,195 --> 02:35:17,780
''For a few days more, please?''

1552
02:35:21,033 --> 02:35:22,826
''l promise, l will be back''

1553
02:35:24,036 --> 02:35:30,500
''l too wish to stay with a son,
who takes his father to be his god''

1554
02:35:31,167 --> 02:35:34,879
lt isn't make believe.
You are really my God...

1555
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:40,050
who has come into my life
as my father

1556
02:35:42,302 --> 02:35:47,891
You held the hand of a child
no one in the world needed

1557
02:35:49,309 --> 02:35:53,229
Who neither had a name
nor an identity...

1558
02:35:53,771 --> 02:35:57,233
he was like a lifeless stone
on the streets

1559
02:35:58,943 --> 02:36:01,945
He would have been rendered to dust
under trampling feet...

1560
02:36:02,321 --> 02:36:06,616
had you not kept a protective
hand on his head

1561
02:36:07,117 --> 02:36:11,079
''This life of mine is
a gift from you, father''

1562
02:36:13,331 --> 02:36:15,291
The life l lead today...

1563
02:36:17,126 --> 02:36:20,546
is indebted to you
in every breath

1564
02:36:23,298 --> 02:36:28,386
''Arpita, even in a hundred
births, l will not be able...''

1565
02:36:30,221 --> 02:36:31,931
to repay their debt

1566
02:36:32,348 --> 02:36:33,808
''Enough, son... enough''

1567
02:36:34,350 --> 02:36:36,977
No father.
l know nothing else

1568
02:36:38,145 --> 02:36:39,855
You can't leave me and go away

1569
02:36:41,148 --> 02:36:44,901
''l'm not leaving you, my son.
lt's only for a few days''

1570
02:36:45,318 --> 02:36:48,655
''All right, father. l will not
turn down anything you say''

1571
02:36:49,239 --> 02:36:52,992
But you will have to listen
to something l have to say

1572
02:36:53,409 --> 02:36:56,954
''You will, won't you?
- All right... what is it?''

1573
02:37:00,165 --> 02:37:03,001
Your daughter-in-law and l have
bought a small gift for you...

1574
02:37:03,377 --> 02:37:05,337
''no, you will not refuse it, father''

1575
02:37:06,296 --> 02:37:12,176
''You promised you won't turn me down.
Come with me... come, mother''

1576
02:37:31,486 --> 02:37:32,695
Father...

1577
02:37:35,489 --> 02:37:37,408
what do you think of the gift?

1578
02:37:40,411 --> 02:37:44,790
My son... what have you done?

1579
02:37:45,165 --> 02:37:46,833
''lt's nothing, father''

1580
02:37:55,508 --> 02:37:59,094
''May you live long, my son''

1581
02:38:11,314 --> 02:38:12,440
Raju...?

1582
02:38:21,448 --> 02:38:24,826
They're here...?
Come to me!

1583
02:38:29,080 --> 02:38:31,082
Brother Raju!
- Ram Avtar!

1584
02:38:31,666 --> 02:38:34,794
lt's months since
l've been waiting for you!

1585
02:38:36,504 --> 02:38:39,089
They've recognised me!
- l knew it...

1586
02:38:39,506 --> 02:38:42,467
the king had to
come back here from his exile

1587
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:45,178
Go inside and take a look...

1588
02:38:45,595 --> 02:38:48,014
l've preserved your house and
your memories as they were

1589
02:38:48,431 --> 02:38:51,517
All right. Look who's here
- Sister-in-law! How have you been?

1590
02:38:51,851 --> 02:38:56,063
''God is kind, brother.
- Recognise me, Uncle...? Alok''

1591
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:58,524
My respects

1592
02:39:00,067 --> 02:39:02,986
But you were staying abroad!
- He's here now...

1593
02:39:03,362 --> 02:39:06,489
''and he has become a very big man!
Touch his feet, daughter-in-law''

1594
02:39:07,324 --> 02:39:08,324
My respects

1595
02:39:09,534 --> 02:39:10,994
''Bless you, daughter-in-law''

1596
02:39:11,327 --> 02:39:14,080
''Go and rest, sister-in-law.
l'll bring some tea for you''

1597
02:39:14,455 --> 02:39:17,458
''Come with me, my child.
l'll show you your in-laws' house''

1598
02:39:22,296 --> 02:39:25,507
''You know what's the best part, Uncle?
You haven't changed...''

1599
02:39:25,882 --> 02:39:28,009
''nor has this house, nor even
the atmosphere in this house''

1600
02:39:28,551 --> 02:39:32,180
''And where have you changed, son?
Though you're a bit taller''

1601
02:39:32,555 --> 02:39:33,514
A bit

1602
02:39:37,393 --> 02:39:39,186
We're home at last

1603
02:39:40,437 --> 02:39:43,273
''We are, but how are
we going to manage it?''

1604
02:39:44,524 --> 02:39:47,944
Do you trust me?
- More than l trust myself

1605
02:39:48,403 --> 02:39:50,822
You love me?
- More than you do yourself

1606
02:39:51,197 --> 02:39:53,157
So what's there to worry about?

1607
02:39:53,449 --> 02:39:56,118
''When you're with me,
l can win over the whole world''

1608
02:39:56,619 --> 02:39:59,580
''Come, let's step into the house.
- Mota bhai...!''

1609
02:40:03,625 --> 02:40:05,585
''Hello, Shanti-behn.
- Pooja, come here...''

1610
02:40:05,961 --> 02:40:08,880
Hemant-bhai... my companion
in lonely times

1611
02:40:09,797 --> 02:40:13,259
Now l know why mota bhai was
so sad in your absence

1612
02:40:13,634 --> 02:40:16,804
''The moment l saw her,
l knew she was Pooja''

1613
02:40:17,096 --> 02:40:20,182
''ln ''Baghban'' he has so often
spoken about her beauty that...''

1614
02:40:20,599 --> 02:40:22,559
''How would you know about ''Baghban''?''

1615
02:40:24,186 --> 02:40:26,354
l see! So l left it at your place?

1616
02:40:26,730 --> 02:40:28,606
Wasn't it a nice thing
that you forgot it there?

1617
02:40:28,940 --> 02:40:32,610
''London's New Wave Publications
had decided to publish it, mota-bhai!''

1618
02:40:33,277 --> 02:40:35,279
What are you talking about?
- Here's the advance

1619
02:40:35,613 --> 02:40:37,573
A cheque of a million rupees.
- A million

1620
02:40:38,616 --> 02:40:39,700
A million...?

1621
02:40:40,367 --> 02:40:41,493
A million...?
- Yes

1622
02:40:41,827 --> 02:40:44,579
Pooja! lt's a million!
- A million

1623
02:40:44,996 --> 02:40:48,083
What's that about a million...?
- My book is getting published!

1624
02:40:48,416 --> 02:40:49,584
Don't tell me!
- Oh yes!

1625
02:40:59,677 --> 02:41:02,012
Have you read the news?

1626
02:41:02,471 --> 02:41:06,308
Dad's book has been acclaimed as a
bestseller in the international market

1627
02:41:06,683 --> 02:41:08,685
Dad's rolling in millions!

1628
02:41:10,812 --> 02:41:12,855
We aren't getting a penny

1629
02:41:13,731 --> 02:41:15,691
All thanks to our elder brothers

1630
02:41:16,484 --> 02:41:19,111
Why?
What wrong have we done to them?

1631
02:41:19,528 --> 02:41:20,904
The two of you must've done something

1632
02:41:21,321 --> 02:41:23,282
Which is why they went away
instead of coming to us

1633
02:41:23,740 --> 02:41:26,576
This is no time to fight
between ourselves!

1634
02:41:27,702 --> 02:41:32,790
This is the time to placate them.
- We must go to Papa and placate him

1635
02:41:33,416 --> 02:41:35,167
Makes no difference

1636
02:41:35,668 --> 02:41:40,047
They won't agree.
- Why not? We're their children

1637
02:41:40,672 --> 02:41:44,009
And no parents can be angry
with their wards forever

1638
02:41:44,468 --> 02:41:46,469
We'll ask for their forgiveness
if we have to

1639
02:41:46,720 --> 02:41:50,139
''Yes, we'll fall at their feet,
grovel before them...''

1640
02:41:50,598 --> 02:41:52,308
let's see how they don't agree.
- Right

1641
02:41:52,725 --> 02:41:55,686
We mustn't delay it anymore.
We must go to them

1642
02:41:57,730 --> 02:42:00,983
Payal and Rahul! Get ready quickly.
We're going to meet grandpa and grandma

1643
02:42:02,818 --> 02:42:06,363
You are all so disgusting! You're
not going to them to apologise...

1644
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:08,698
you're going to them
for the money!

1645
02:42:09,741 --> 02:42:13,244
We've seen them being put to
enough trouble. Not anymore

1646
02:42:13,744 --> 02:42:15,871
We are not going.
Come Rahul

1647
02:42:28,550 --> 02:42:32,261
''See the magic of your brimming
rosegarden, Mr Malhotra?''

1648
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:36,348
''lt's all thanks to the kids
and you, Mr Varma''

1649
02:42:36,766 --> 02:42:39,143
l didn't ever expect
such a tremendous response

1650
02:42:39,476 --> 02:42:42,396
Response? The first edition has
sold like hot cakes

1651
02:42:42,771 --> 02:42:46,733
The second one is in press.
And this is all yours

1652
02:42:50,695 --> 02:42:53,406
What's this...?
- Just keep collecting it

1653
02:42:53,781 --> 02:42:55,658
''There's no saying how much more
''Baghban'' will make''

1654
02:42:56,784 --> 02:43:01,413
We're holding a function next week
in your honour

1655
02:43:01,747 --> 02:43:05,250
Do please attend. And bring
your family along too

1656
02:43:16,719 --> 02:43:17,720
Over there?

1657
02:43:52,668 --> 02:43:57,506
''Ladies and gentlemen,
''Baghban'' needs no introduction''

1658
02:43:58,674 --> 02:44:02,135
That its author has been honoured
with the Bookers' Prize...

1659
02:44:02,719 --> 02:44:06,097
speaks volume for its success

1660
02:44:08,850 --> 02:44:14,230
''Before l ask Mr Malhotra to
throw some light on ''Baghban''...''

1661
02:44:14,897 --> 02:44:19,109
l would like his son to say
a few words about his father

1662
02:44:21,653 --> 02:44:24,072
l therefore request to the stage...

1663
02:44:25,866 --> 02:44:27,826
Mr Alok Raj

1664
02:44:31,245 --> 02:44:32,830
Alok-ji...

1665
02:44:46,843 --> 02:44:50,597
You must've often heard people
saying that no one has seen God

1666
02:44:51,514 --> 02:44:55,518
''That it's a matter of devotion,
faith and one's belief''

1667
02:44:56,018 --> 02:44:59,647
But l can tell you
that l have seen God

1668
02:45:01,899 --> 02:45:04,651
''ln flesh and blood,
smiling and laughing...''

1669
02:45:05,026 --> 02:45:10,114
''in every joy, in every sorrow,
in every test and every situation''

1670
02:45:11,949 --> 02:45:13,701
lt's none else...

1671
02:45:14,035 --> 02:45:15,911
than my father

1672
02:45:19,248 --> 02:45:23,502
l was an orphan. l had
never seen my parents

1673
02:45:24,878 --> 02:45:27,380
Neither did l ever
have their love

1674
02:45:29,257 --> 02:45:33,845
''But l can tell you with confidence,
that had they been here today...''

1675
02:45:34,887 --> 02:45:38,641
they couldn't have given me
so much of love and affection...

1676
02:45:39,016 --> 02:45:40,976
as l got from my father

1677
02:45:42,728 --> 02:45:44,688
l have got so much from my father...

1678
02:45:45,730 --> 02:45:47,691
that l can't ask him
for anything more

1679
02:45:49,150 --> 02:45:51,569
But of God l seek one thing

1680
02:45:53,696 --> 02:46:01,954
''ln His world, he must continue to
make people like my father''

1681
02:46:08,918 --> 02:46:12,922
That's it. l have
nothing more to say

1682
02:46:15,758 --> 02:46:17,384
''Please come here, father''

1683
02:46:26,977 --> 02:46:28,686
Ladies and gentlemen...

1684
02:46:29,104 --> 02:46:32,440
l hope you won't believe all that
you heard about me just now

1685
02:46:34,025 --> 02:46:37,111
Alok praises me so much only because
he loves me very much

1686
02:46:38,654 --> 02:46:40,948
And he doesn't love me because
l'm a very good human being...

1687
02:46:41,323 --> 02:46:43,617
or because l have several virtues.
He loves me because...

1688
02:46:43,992 --> 02:46:45,952
he himself is a very nice boy

1689
02:46:47,954 --> 02:46:52,500
''Actually, l am not a writer''

1690
02:46:55,002 --> 02:46:57,796
Writers are those that plunge deep
into the oceans of knowledge...

1691
02:46:58,130 --> 02:47:00,966
and come up with rare gems
of literature

1692
02:47:03,218 --> 02:47:08,181
l have only written
what life has taught me

1693
02:47:11,934 --> 02:47:17,815
''Baghban'' is not about me
or any other individual''

1694
02:47:21,068 --> 02:47:26,364
lt's a book of the conflict
arising between the days gone by...

1695
02:47:26,740 --> 02:47:29,284
and the days to come

1696
02:47:32,829 --> 02:47:38,792
lt's a book about the broken
relations between two generations

1697
02:47:41,128 --> 02:47:47,050
lt's a book about
the drooping shoulders...

1698
02:47:48,968 --> 02:47:53,681
on which some children had once sat
to see the world

1699
02:47:55,975 --> 02:48:01,730
lt's a book about the
trembling hands...

1700
02:48:04,149 --> 02:48:09,445
''that once had held the hands of their
children, as they taught them to walk''

1701
02:48:11,989 --> 02:48:14,492
lt's a book about the parched lips...

1702
02:48:16,202 --> 02:48:18,078
that once sang lullabies

1703
02:48:21,123 --> 02:48:23,125
But which have now been silenced

1704
02:48:32,091 --> 02:48:33,718
Times have changed

1705
02:48:35,136 --> 02:48:36,929
Life has changed

1706
02:48:39,056 --> 02:48:41,391
lf people of my generation
will recall...

1707
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:45,562
we were always caught up ties and
in relations that yielded nothing

1708
02:48:48,857 --> 02:48:50,817
Our father was God

1709
02:48:53,194 --> 02:48:55,488
At our mother's feet
lay our heaven

1710
02:48:59,992 --> 02:49:01,160
And now...

1711
02:49:03,203 --> 02:49:05,163
now people have become
very sensible

1712
02:49:08,249 --> 02:49:13,421
The new generation is very
clever and practical

1713
02:49:17,133 --> 02:49:20,594
''For them, every relation
is like a ladder...''

1714
02:49:21,011 --> 02:49:23,680
on which they will step
to rise further in life

1715
02:49:26,183 --> 02:49:30,144
But when they have no use
for the ladder anymore...

1716
02:49:31,938 --> 02:49:35,358
with the rest of the broken
furniture in the house...

1717
02:49:37,193 --> 02:49:42,531
''old vessels, old clothes
and newspapers...''

1718
02:49:44,991 --> 02:49:49,621
they are dumped in the attic

1719
02:49:54,292 --> 02:50:00,672
''However, life does not
take you up like a ladder''

1720
02:50:04,968 --> 02:50:06,761
Life grows like a tree

1721
02:50:09,389 --> 02:50:15,478
Parents are not the steps
on a ladder

1722
02:50:19,231 --> 02:50:23,860
Parents are the soul
of one's life

1723
02:50:25,237 --> 02:50:29,199
''However big the tree is,
however green and filled it is...''

1724
02:50:31,284 --> 02:50:34,495
''it can't stand on its own,
once its roots are hacked''

1725
02:50:37,331 --> 02:50:40,584
''With all humility and respect,
l ask today...''

1726
02:50:47,299 --> 02:50:49,467
the children for whose happiness...

1727
02:50:51,052 --> 02:50:57,016
a father spends every penny of his
hard earned money with a smile...

1728
02:50:59,310 --> 02:51:04,272
''those very children, when the
father's eye-sight weakens...''

1729
02:51:05,357 --> 02:51:08,318
why do they hesitate in
giving them light ?

1730
02:51:13,156 --> 02:51:19,244
lf a father can help his son to
take the first step in his life...

1731
02:51:20,287 --> 02:51:22,247
why can't the son...

1732
02:51:22,497 --> 02:51:28,044
give his father support when he's
taking the last few steps of his life?

1733
02:51:30,338 --> 02:51:33,925
What crime is it of the parents
who have devoted all their lives...

1734
02:51:34,342 --> 02:51:38,846
''to their children, that they are
given tears and loneliness?''

1735
02:51:40,472 --> 02:51:42,766
lf they can't give us
any love...

1736
02:51:43,141 --> 02:51:45,644
who gives them the right to
snatch our love from us?

1737
02:51:46,228 --> 02:51:50,982
What do these children think?
The parents God has united in love...

1738
02:51:51,357 --> 02:51:56,320
can they separate and force them to
lead a life of misery and despair?

1739
02:51:57,488 --> 02:52:00,491
ls it for a day like this
that man seeks children?

1740
02:52:03,410 --> 02:52:05,453
Children perhaps forget...

1741
02:52:07,330 --> 02:52:09,457
''what is our present today,
will be their present tomorrow''

1742
02:52:11,459 --> 02:52:14,378
''lf we are old today,
they will also grow old someday''

1743
02:52:15,421 --> 02:52:18,465
''The questions we ask today,
they will ask tomorrow''

1744
02:52:22,135 --> 02:52:25,889
As for me...

1745
02:52:29,392 --> 02:52:31,602
please don't worry about me

1746
02:52:33,396 --> 02:52:38,150
Because if l am capable of
bringing up my children...

1747
02:52:38,525 --> 02:52:42,362
helping them become able
and independent...

1748
02:52:43,196 --> 02:52:45,365
l am capable of taking
care of myself too

1749
02:52:46,283 --> 02:52:50,119
l feel no need to expect
anything from anyone

1750
02:52:52,121 --> 02:52:55,041
Because l am very fortunate

1751
02:52:58,419 --> 02:53:00,379
l am fortunate...

1752
02:53:05,217 --> 02:53:10,179
because life has given me
a companion...

1753
02:53:14,517 --> 02:53:18,187
walking with whom has
made my path easier

1754
02:53:20,314 --> 02:53:24,693
Walking with whom my hardships
were always blown away

1755
02:53:29,239 --> 02:53:32,158
And that companion is my wife

1756
02:53:40,207 --> 02:53:44,711
People often fall in love.
However...

1757
02:53:48,381 --> 02:53:51,467
they don't express it
as often as they should

1758
02:53:53,302 --> 02:53:55,471
l wouldn't want to
make a mistake like that

1759
02:54:05,981 --> 02:54:07,148
Pooja...

1760
02:54:08,900 --> 02:54:10,944
l love you very much

1761
02:54:15,281 --> 02:54:16,657
Very much

1762
02:54:21,578 --> 02:54:24,456
''Because you are, l am''

1763
02:54:26,958 --> 02:54:28,960
And there's everything
if we are together

1764
02:54:31,546 --> 02:54:35,758
''Else, there's nothing.
Nothing''

1765
02:54:43,307 --> 02:54:47,185
That's all l had to say

1766
02:55:08,371 --> 02:55:10,999
Sorry... please forgive us

1767
02:55:11,416 --> 02:55:12,959
''Please forgive us, dad''

1768
02:55:19,506 --> 02:55:23,468
''Sir, how would you react had ''Baghban''
''been your personal experience?''

1769
02:55:25,971 --> 02:55:28,473
''Those children,
who don't love their parents...''

1770
02:55:30,266 --> 02:55:32,185
who don't give them shelter...

1771
02:55:32,977 --> 02:55:34,979
who don't respect them...

1772
02:55:36,355 --> 02:55:38,357
l'd never forgive them

1773
02:55:41,568 --> 02:55:43,528
l'd rather punish them

1774
02:55:45,572 --> 02:55:47,532
l'd disown them

1775
02:55:57,625 --> 02:56:02,546
A mother always forgives her children

1776
02:56:03,422 --> 02:56:05,590
Won't you forgive us?

1777
02:56:08,426 --> 02:56:14,932
''Yes, as a mother l may
perhaps forgive you''

1778
02:56:16,392 --> 02:56:18,936
But as a wife...

1779
02:56:20,479 --> 02:56:23,565
l cannot forget the
tears my husband has shed

1780
02:56:24,357 --> 02:56:27,569
And all of you are the ones
who made them shed tears

1781
02:56:30,613 --> 02:56:36,410
l can't say anything about.
But l have nothing to give you today

1782
02:56:37,453 --> 02:56:39,163
Not even forgiveness
