VINARA SODARA VEERA KUMARA

2
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:23,786
[music]

3
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:46,970
[waves splashing]
Come uncle, I'll tell you.

4
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,974
You woke me up at midnight and
brought me here. Where are you taking us?

5
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:50,560
-Come, brother.
-Why don't you say where you're taking us?

6
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:52,236
-What's this haste?
-It's you we are asking.

7
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,554
Wait.

8
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,826
Hey kid, wait!

9
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:03,232
[music]

10
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:20,905
See how this idiot is guzzling
the beer carelessly ignoring us!

11
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,747
He won't stop his meddles
until he gets all of us in trouble.

12
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:27,588
Calm down whitey!
Whom does he have other than us?

13
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:31,301
Then, who will be there for us if
Poorna gets to know that we are with him?

14
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:33,782
So what Srinu bro? Would he kill us?

15
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:36,308
If we hit him with a Jackscrew
when he lays hands on us,

16
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:37,619
He would puke blood.

17
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:38,405
You fool!

18
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:41,462
You are not even as big as a
tyre, and you talk like Ramana?

19
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,758
He is the root cause of all this mess.

20
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:47,810
Look uncle, things would get messy
if Poorna comes to know about this.

21
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,510
Better you come along with me.

22
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:53,100
Your daughter's education will abruptly
end if something wrong happens to you.

23
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,778
Even your dream would be
snapped midway. It's up to you.

24
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:57,522
Come on dude!
Why should we even discuss with them?

25
00:03:58,643 --> 00:03:59,649
To hell with his love!

26
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,221
Forgive me kid!

27
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,704
Please stay uncle.
He would be all alone.

28
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:07,015
Uncle stay.
Please uncle.

29
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:09,236
-Please leave me.
-Uncle, wait!

30
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:17,881
Hey, what are you doing here?

31
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,655
Where have you been since evening?

32
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:24,099
I want to stay with brother.

33
00:04:24,976 --> 00:04:26,363
Forget him! Get inside.

34
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,568
Please mom, he is all alone.

35
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:32,471
Everyone left me.

36
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,416
Even Sulochana left me.

37
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,180
Next week, she's getting
married to her cousin, Poorna.

38
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:47,461
I've decided to die right before
her eyes in the very wedding hall.

39
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:50,099
Before I die, I have a work to do.

40
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:54,730
I have a friend named Suri.

41
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:57,209
He resides beside my house.

42
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:02,719
The strange thing is that he
can be neither seen nor heard.

43
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:05,981
He knows just one thing.

44
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,152
He knocks twice to say 'yes'
and and knocks once for 'no'.

45
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:12,142
There is a last wish of his.

46
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:15,098
I gave him my word to fulfil
his last wish before I die.

47
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:17,004
His last wish is,

48
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:23,144
He asked me to visit four important
people in his life and apologize to them.

49
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,222
The four important people
in his life are his teacher,

50
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:33,015
parents, his friend and his lover.

51
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:40,487
This one week journey of mine
is to meet those four people.

52
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:46,308
Initially, I came to his college to
meet his teacher as per my word to Suri.

53
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:50,736
Whom do you want mister?

54
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:52,999
I want to meet a teacher.

55
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:56,681
-Are you looking for principal?
-Yes.

56
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:58,773
Take left and sit there. I will call you.

57
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,069
[running sound]

58
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:10,835
Hey you bloody Poorna!
Won't you stop chasing me?

59
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:13,019
You've sent your boys again.

60
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:21,455
How dare you flirt with my sister?

61
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:24,407
Brother, we are just juniors.
The seniors are on the upper floor.

62
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:26,366
Hey, let's go.

63
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:32,625
[music]

64
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:44,549
Young blood!

65
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,380
Even I was like them a few years ago.

66
00:06:51,383 --> 00:06:53,124
Is it necessary to bash Venu?

67
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:55,155
He has to be beaten black and blue today.

68
00:06:55,807 --> 00:06:57,607
Leave it dude. Let's go home.

69
00:06:58,143 --> 00:07:00,511
He is arrogant as
his father is a local president.

70
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,906
He might come that way,

71
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:04,020
You hide here
and I'll be hiding there.

72
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:04,921
Go dude.

73
00:07:07,797 --> 00:07:09,191
Hey, I think he is coming.

74
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:12,044
-Is it him?
-Yes, dude.

75
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:16,060
Listen, it is difficult for me at
home to come out at midnight.

76
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,140
Stop blabbering.

77
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:19,028
You are the reason my
husband fights with me daily.

78
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:22,151
Hey! These are just usual daily tiffs.

79
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:23,954
Why do you blabber?
I will take care of that.

80
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:27,282
Don't trouble me again.
I can't take it anymore.

81
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:29,188
It is not happening.
[Fighting sound]

82
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:33,234
-Hey
-Who are you?

83
00:07:33,337 --> 00:07:34,848
It's me, Ramana.

84
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:36,202
Look at me, fool!

85
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:37,261
Look at me properly.

86
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,441
If you mess with me ever again,

87
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:43,208
I will crush you under
my auto, filthy fool!

88
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:52,169
[birds chirping]

89
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:58,541
[phone ringing]

90
00:07:59,312 --> 00:07:59,954
Hello

91
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:03,667
Suri, the president's son got to
know that you are at the rice mill.

92
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:05,039
-He is coming for you.
-Is it?

93
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:06,033
Run away from there.

94
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,829
Hey Ramana, get up.
Come on, get up.

95
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,048
Get up man, they are coming.

96
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:15,879
Run.

97
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:18,115
Come on, run.

98
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:20,017
Didn't you hit them in the dark?

99
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:21,509
How did they get to know about it?

100
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:23,834
-I told him.
-You fool!

101
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,033
Are you nuts?
Come on, run.

102
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,436
They are carrying sticks too!

103
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:30,593
You've become power star Pawan
Kalyan! [vehicle arriving]

104
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:31,950
Yous saw that Suri?

105
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:33,793
We just thought about
our boss and he's here.

106
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:34,882
Come on, move.

107
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,573
Hey!

108
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,778
You fools!
How did you even try to catch Ramana!

109
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,082
Hey, play the song of our boss.

110
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:44,341
Hey, you arrived at the right time.

111
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:49,534
Come on idiots, catch us.

112
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,556
Why are they trying to catch us?
What do they think about Ramana?

113
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:55,931
Why do we bother if he is the son of
the president or anyone else?

114
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,202
[soil rustling]

115
00:08:57,981 --> 00:09:00,663
[vehicle halts]

116
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:05,940
It costed 7000 bucks for your maintenance,

117
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:07,603
6000 bucks for the rent
of the auto-rickshaw,

118
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:12,111
and 5000 bucks to get the
auto-rickshaw from the police station.

119
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:13,648
making it a total of 18,000 bucks.

120
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:20,629
Is it true the SI and the president became
allies and asked you to leave the village?

121
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:26,070
And they threatened you
to book an FIR against you?

122
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:30,619
Your father said that you
are leaving the village.

123
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:32,909
Pay the total amount and then, leave.

124
00:09:33,494 --> 00:09:34,466
I am not going to America,

125
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:38,228
It is just the neigbouring village.
I will run it in that village.

126
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:40,160
I will come here once a
week and pay your money.

127
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,791
I won't trust you.

128
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:45,209
Hey, get that wrench.

129
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:58,219
Enough of your service to us,

130
00:09:58,991 --> 00:09:59,993
First pay up and leave.

131
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:01,527
That is the reason,
I was asking the auto-rickshaw again.

132
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:06,055
I'm like Basha.
I won't keep telling the same thing.

133
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,577
Let it be dude. We can ask some
other people in the village.

134
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,083
That is what I was saying. It would
better if you have a calm attitude.

135
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:19,332
Like your friend got accustomed
to me from last half an hour,

136
00:10:19,713 --> 00:10:21,634
You're also
accustomed to me since 4 years.

137
00:10:23,284 --> 00:10:24,139
You have everything abnormal.

138
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:26,337
Calm down a little.

139
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:29,530
Don't repeat this monkey
business in that village.

140
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:30,977
Keep the vehicle safe.

141
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,089
You have to make payment on time.

142
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:38,005
I wouldn't take it easy this time.

143
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:41,226
-Stay safe. Stay in touch on phone
-Keep visiting.

144
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,584
-Alright dude!
-Bye.

145
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,750
-Okay, bye.
-Bye

146
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:46,207
I'll keep visiting.

147
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:48,299
What's up Suri? Shall I leave?

148
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:50,337
Be careful.
Don't be aggressive.

149
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:52,758
Don't keep messing with people
there. It's not our village.

150
00:10:53,002 --> 00:10:54,815
Hey, I belong to the
place wherever I stand.

151
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,540
I won't discriminate
anyone if they cross me.

152
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:57,756
Call me if you
get into any such situations.

153
00:10:57,985 --> 00:11:00,095
Attaboy! That's my Suri.

154
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,461
-Fine. Take care of your parents.
-Alright, shall I leave?

155
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:05,755
Don't forget us if you
make new friends over there.

156
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:08,120
No matter how many friends I
make, I won't forget Suri.

157
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,348
He is unique.

158
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:13,305
-First, leave from here.
-Hey Suri!

159
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:20,044
[music]

160
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:27,856
It is our ill-fate that we have
to flee from our own village.

161
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,822
How does the place matter?
We are dependent on the ocean.

162
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,790
Wherever there is an ocean,
it is our place.

163
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,674
Is it not enough if we live with
decently wherever we go?

164
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,329
You have given birth to
such a shameless son.

165
00:11:36,505 --> 00:11:38,569
Is it? As if it was on my own.

166
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:41,374
It is now that you are
having understanding problems,

167
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:43,525
Aren't you the one who
pampered him since childhood?

168
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:46,462
That is the reason your son had made
us to get thrown out of our own village.

169
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:49,526
He roamed worthless when
I asked him to study.

170
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,846
Now, he is making us roam
around cop stations and courts.

171
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:54,525
Very soon, they'll hang me
for his mischievous acts.

172
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,396
You'll get rid of me.

173
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:57,766
Did he steal or murder?

174
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,743
Isn't aggression common in youth?

175
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,208
This is the very result
of that aggression.

176
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:05,174
Where's your awesome son
who said he'd follow us?

177
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,956
Oh! Why do you keep whining about
him always? He'd be on the way.

178
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:08,950
-Is this the house?
-Yes.

179
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,287
-Looks good enough.
-Yes, but the rent is a little high.

180
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,816
-No problem.
-I will unload the luggage.

181
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,104
Here, place them here.

182
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,016
I will unload them and
you place them inside.

183
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,905
Careful! You might give them dents!

184
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:25,901
Is it you who moved
into this house, sister?

185
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,272
-Yes, dear. Where do you stay?
-I'm your neighbour.

186
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:30,080
Is it? That's my husband.

187
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,275
Take this, sister. There are
lemon rice and curry in this.

188
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,571
Oh! Why do you take the trouble?
I would have cooked in a while.

189
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,510
-That's okay sister.
-I'll place it here.

190
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:39,377
-Which village did you come from?
-Panaspadu village, near Samalkota.

191
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,390
My niece was married to a guy
who lives in that village.

192
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:44,071
I fogot his name.
Actually, he is a tailor.

193
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:45,001
Is it?

194
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:47,225
He is my son, Gyaneswar Rao.

195
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:48,720
Everyone calls him 'kid'.

196
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:53,425
-Is it just the two of you?
-No, we have a good for nothing gem!

197
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:56,058
-Tell her about your great son.
-This is the case.

198
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,803
They can't even stay
calm even for a second.

199
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,180
Both are poles apart.

200
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:01,778
-I am being crushed between them.
-What does he do, sister?

201
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:04,382
He used to fly planes.
Just that they don't fit into the lanes.

202
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:07,164
-Hey, give me.
-He is an auto-driver.

203
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,389
Auto-rickshaw?
Where is brother, aunt?

204
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:10,749
This kid sure knows the relations!

205
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:13,984
He started along with us. He might
have been to an auto-rickshaw stand.

206
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:17,390
-Auto-stand?
-Hey, be careful.

207
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:20,162
His dad passed away leaving him behind.

208
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,127
I am unable to bear with him.

209
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:24,099
-He is crazy about auto-rickshaw.
-Is it?

210
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:26,557
No one gives him work for
long as he is a kid.

211
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,148
Somehow, I am managing our lives.

212
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,201
I won't move my auto.
Do whatever you can.

213
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,098
How dare you dominate us at our place?

214
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:33,910
-Who the hell are you to decide?
-You move it first.

215
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,759
-Why don't you speak up uncle?

216
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:38,079
-I won't move it.
-Just a minute.

217
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:41,785
Brothers, its a tiff of our auto-rickshaw
union. Kindly leave us alone.

218
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:44,502
-Uncle.
-Yeah.

219
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:48,891
Are we fools to allow a stranger to
park his auto-rickshaw in our stand?

220
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:49,960
Then, show it man.

221
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,793
What should we show? We aren't.

222
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,929
-You aren't what?
-We aren't that foolish?

223
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:55,767
-Then, how foolish are you?
-Hey, Whitey!

224
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:59,266
Not even once did he utter that word.
It's you who are branding us fools.

225
00:13:59,336 --> 00:13:59,941
You hold on.

226
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,341
What's your final call young man?

227
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:04,887
I want my auto-rickshaw
to stay in this stand.

228
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,356
-What if we didn't accept?
-Who are you to dictate terms?

229
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:10,734
There is only one stand in this village.
And it doesn't belong to your father.

230
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,534
-We have to work together. Okay uncle?
-Yes.

231
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:15,222
Anjanna, give me a cigarettte.

232
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:17,520
And the match box too.

233
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:20,412
Here bro.

234
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:25,242
Brother, hire me for your auto-rickshaw.

235
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:28,825
-Sure. Tag along.
-Thanks, brother.

236
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:33,245
Come early in the morning.
We have good deals from college students.

237
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,303
-Is it?
-Yes.

238
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:36,589
-Where do you stay?
-In your lane, brother.

239
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:38,471
I just met your mother.

240
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:42,704
Don't tell her about this habit.
She would bash me with her broom.

241
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:43,393
Sure brother.

242
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:45,172
You are superb. Come with me.

243
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:48,884
Where did you go so early in the morning?

244
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:51,612
I've dispatched a load of fish to Kolkata.

245
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,059
-Did our girl wake up?
-Yes.

246
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,424
Isn't she getting late to the college?

247
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:58,937
Sulochana,
you are getting late to college.

248
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:02,296
[music]

249
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:07,916
Wow! You are beautiful!

250
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:10,030
Did Sulochana get ready aunt?

251
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:13,192
Gayathri is already here.

252
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,066
-Come fast.
-Bye mom.

253
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:18,822
Bye dad!

254
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:21,512
I've got ready hastily.
Am I looking good?

255
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:23,993
You look beautiful no matter how you are.

256
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:27,388
But people get into a bad state
if I look any less beautiful.

257
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:28,704
They get so worried.

258
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,223
Is it? Who are those people?

259
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:32,463
It's our classmates.

260
00:15:32,671 --> 00:15:34,847
Yesterday, Uday sir was staring at
me without even blinking his eyes.

261
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:36,628
I thought of warning him.

262
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:38,800
but I stopped myself
because he might deduct my marks.

263
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:40,246
Poor old man!

264
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:42,207
Why are you so late bro?

265
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:45,599
Why were you early?
I told you I'd pick you, didn't I?

266
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,407
Make sure you call me
before you come next.

267
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:50,135
-Hey!
-Brother!

268
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:51,718
Thank god!

269
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:55,594
Brother, babe is saved!

270
00:15:55,694 --> 00:15:56,798
He dare calls me babe!

271
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:00,875
Come, let's teach him a lesson. Idiot!

272
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:06,275
Moron!

273
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,476
It is burning inside me
looking at his auto first.

274
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,037
I'm already in ashes.

275
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:12,328
Look out for the college students.

276
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,760
Sister get into this auto-rickshaw.

277
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:16,499
This is only auto-rickshaw
which has Babubali tyres,

278
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:20,027
power star engine and a
poster of Mahesh Babu.

279
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,264
Step in and start the day for my bro.

280
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,787
I will smash your teeth if
you ever call me babe again.

281
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:39,244
-You...
-No brother.

282
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:41,386
Leave it bro. Forget it.

283
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,060
-Who the hell is she?
-Sulochana, daughter of Jaya Babu.

284
00:16:51,284 --> 00:16:53,757
She has a cousin,
Poorna who is a scoundrel.

285
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,321
He is cunning and rich.

286
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:57,531
Does that mean they can slap anyone?

287
00:16:57,836 --> 00:17:00,812
Consider that she touched you for
some reason, forget it brother.

288
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,174
I don't understand why
Sulochana slapped you.

289
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:04,108
Just leave it.

290
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:06,656
Wouldn't anyone board my
auto-rickshaw other than students?

291
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,470
Yeah they would!

292
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:10,963
Only uncles and aunties would.

293
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:14,923
The size of three oldies will
be equivalent to 10 students.

294
00:17:16,016 --> 00:17:16,879
It isn't profitable bro.

295

[vehicle arriving]

296
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,186
Isn't your awesome son home yet?

297
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:28,170
God knows whom he is
quarrelling in this new village?

298
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,005
I don't think that's the case!

299
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,244
Seems he is finding commuters.

300
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:33,731
Stop scolding him all the
time and go to early to sleep.

301
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:35,028
You've got to sell the
fish in the morning.

302
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:41,759
This looks like a good place.

Please try again later.

Ramana is wrecked man.

312
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:16,077
I boasted that I would rock
in this village, didn't I?

313
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,227
Everything turned upside down man!

314
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:25,714
Some girl named Sulochana
slapped me for no reason.

315
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:33,397
That's it. No one is
boarding my auto-rickshaw.

316
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:37,602
What a life this
Ramana had in our village?

317
00:19:39,154 --> 00:19:40,962
Everything is lost here.

318
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:48,315

Ramana... Suri, are you listening?

Hey, I won't spare her.

322
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:11,421
I will kill her Suri.

00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:16,895
What shall I do?

345
00:21:16,935 --> 00:21:18,235
What happened?

346
00:21:18,315 --> 00:21:21,294
There is a girl named
Sulochana in this village.

347
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,425
She is the root cause of everything.

348
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:30,886
She looks like a beautiful damsel.

349
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,306
But she is a big demon.

350
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:38,534
Hey, shall I kill her?

351
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:39,116
[knock]

352
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,563
Hey Suri,
I'll kill her and bury her right here.

353
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,191
[knock]

354
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:50,509
That would be the end of her menace.

355
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:51,642
Hey Suri, stay on line.

356
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,133
Hello Ramana.

357
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:55,814
Hello... Why did it get disconnected?

358
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:57,893
I'll kill her. Hey...
[knock]

359
00:21:58,879 --> 00:21:59,759

Hey, I will kill.
[knock]

362
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:28,996
Why are you going slow brother?

363
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,201
We wouldn't have
auto-rickshaw after the evening.

364
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:34,533
What are you talking about brother?

365
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,580
You heard it. Raju Uncle called me.

366
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:40,488
He said he would seize the auto-rickshaw
if I wouldn't pay him by the evening.

367
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:43,325
Don't worry brother. Today, we
will get customers at any cost...

368
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,280
Oh no!

00:22:54,698 --> 00:22:58,183
-Brother, babe is saved again!
-Hey...

[puppy crying]
Sulochana

375
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,728
He was actually referring to
that puppy when he called babe.

376
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:10,547
Are you sure?

377
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:12,752
Yeah. I think that puppy
came in his way that day too.

378
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,558
He hit us to avoid it.

379
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:21,504
-Sister, please board it.
-Please board for Engineering college.

380
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:24,429
Engineering college!

381
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,147
Hey...

382

384
00:23:40,975 --> 00:23:42,724
Brother, they've boarded our vehicle.

385
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:44,813
Hey, you get down.

386
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,463
-How did you let them board the vehicle?
-We are sorry.

387
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:48,504
-Get down first.
-Let it be, brother.

388
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:50,727
Sulochana boarded that
auto-rickshaw. Let's go.

389
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:53,302
-Please, let them stay.
-Sulochana boarded that auto-rickshaw.

390
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:56,611
-Please bro.
-She is Swapna.

391
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,963
Please bro.

392
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:02,155
Right... Right
Bajrangbali!

395
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,495
Hello, I am sorry.

396
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:26,673
Are you out of your mind to
apologise to him? Let's go.

397
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:28,164

Why did you come so early sister?

401
00:25:18,532 --> 00:25:20,936
I've got relatives at home. Dad called.

402
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:22,043
Come on move.

403
00:25:23,512 --> 00:25:24,873
Where should I head to? Into a canal?

404
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:27,028
Hey kid, tell her that this vehicle
wouldn't move unless it's full.

405
00:25:27,346 --> 00:25:29,620
I will pay the fare of all
the seats. Ask him to move.

406
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,024
Brother, she said she'd
pay it all. Let's go.

[tyres screeching]

410
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:50,243
He did what he said.

411
00:25:50,907 --> 00:25:51,625
What did I do?

412
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:56,269
Didn't he ask me if it's into
a canal that I want to go?

413
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:58,859
Who knows it would turn real?

414
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:01,538
Brother, you keep talking

415
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:03,776
Meantime, I will go get some help.

Why do you sulk all the time?

Why don't you smile a bit?

421
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,933
I tried many times to apologise to
you for slapping you on that day.

422
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:08,561
But you turn into a stone
the moment you look at me.

423
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:13,798
I am sorry for what
happened that day.

424
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:20,575
Anyway, why don't we go
inside instead of standing here?

425
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:22,172
Is there anyone inside?

Why do you look all excited and
enthusiastic today bro?

432
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:24,900
I suspect something fishy brother.

433
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:26,756
Nothing of that sort.

434
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:31,793
I've been observing you since
your arrival. Tell me brother.

435

Nothing dude.

Hey, where are you going?
This is our auto-rickshaw.

437
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:38,778
Let's board another auto-rickshaw today.

438
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:41,782
If we keep changing
auto-rickshaws every day

439
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:44,671
The young guys waiting for me
would pass away out of frustration!

-Tell me, brother.
-Hey, Sulochana is here.

Look, he is the one who drops
us quicker than the others

I've got an ache in my leg.
That's the reason.

Don't you have a front row?

-Look at me once. I love you.

497
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:34,066
Sister, please tell him
to stop hitting him.

00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:35,077
Please sister.

499
00:33:37,465 --> 00:33:39,251

Please leave him.

00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:47,010
Sister, tell him to stop
hitting my brother.

502
00:33:50,286 --> 00:33:52,405
How dare you write a love letter to
her despite knowing she is my sister?

503
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:53,828
Drag him away.

Let's go. The principal is calling you.

507
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:03,185
Tell me.

508
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,550
My friend Suri
studied in this college sir.

509
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,510
What happened to him?

510
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,640
He is dead.

511
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:14,483
So, I came to meet his
favourite teacher and his friend.

512
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,571
When did he study here?

513
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:16,816
It's been two years sir.

514
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,838
It's been only a year
that I joined this college.

515
00:34:19,038 --> 00:34:21,043
Go and get the details from
the lecturers upstairs.

516
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:23,094
Suresh... I mean your Suri.

517
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:27,269
He was an extraordinary student and
we've expected him to become a collector.

518
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:29,913
But we find it some kind of a
mystery to hear about his death.

519
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:33,693
Suresh was a very bright student...

520
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:39,859
Hey Suri, I met many lecturers but
I felt that they are not your Guru.

521
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:42,661
I lost faith that I'd meet your Guru.

522
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:48,747
[music]

523
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,831
Suri... He used to top in every subject.

524
00:34:57,924 --> 00:34:59,079
Even in music.

525
00:35:00,095 --> 00:35:01,792
He used to grasp any Raga in a jiffy.

526
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,275
He used to share everything with me...

527
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,347
...including family matters and friends.

528
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,154
He never did anything
without intimating me.

529
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:10,113
That is the one thing...

530
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,842
But that idiot didn't
inform me before dying!

531
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,199
He sent you to ask me forgiveness.

532
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:18,147
And you came down.

533
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,230
Every student of this
college would remember us.

534
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:22,861
But we would remember only two persons.

535
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:25,573
One is an adept and
the other one an idiot.

536
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:26,873
He falls under both categories.

537
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,706
An idiot who doesn't know how to live.

538
00:35:30,972 --> 00:35:33,235
He is an idiot who betrayed me for love.

539
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:36,735
I won't forgive him. I can't either.

540
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,514
Leave.

541
00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:44,284
[music]

542
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:54,979
Listen... this is the
list of Suresh's friends.

543
00:35:55,473 --> 00:35:56,415
The principal asked me to give it to you.

544
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,641
Most of his friends hail from Marripalem.

545
00:36:01,013 --> 00:36:02,540
You might get any useful
information if you go there.

546
00:36:04,027 --> 00:36:05,590
-Thank you very much.
-Okay.

547
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:06,808
Take care.

548
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,623
It's alright that he
cried, because he turned old.

549
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:12,971
He cried because he cannot
understand your love and sacrifice.

550
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,309
Why do I have tears in my eyes too?

551
00:36:15,844 --> 00:36:17,623
Well, the old man is finicky.

552
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:19,535
He said he won't forgive you on my face.

553
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:23,685
How can he even
understand the love in youth?

554
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,163
Now, I am going to meet your friend.

555
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:28,523
But your Guru asked me
something in the end.

556
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:30,431
I didn't know what to answer.

557
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:33,625
It's about... your acquaintance.

558
00:36:34,796 --> 00:36:37,148
-Hey Suri.
-What are you doing dude?

559
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,488
-I'm boozing man.
-Where?

560
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:42,186
-In my house.
-Good gracious! You became a daredevil.

561
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:44,270
Hey, my parents are out of town.

562
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:48,608
Awesome! Is it just booze or
do you have anything else too?

563
00:36:48,628 --> 00:36:50,357
As if my life doesn't have enough hassles.

564
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:55,680
Hey Suri, I will kill Poorna... very soon.

565
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,258
-He laid his hands on Ramana.
-Did he hit you?

566
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:05,372
It's not just that!
But he hit me before Sulochana.

567
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:15,773
Hello... Hello.

568
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:19,918
Moron! He seems to have passed
out due to excess boozing.

569
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:27,233
Hey Suri, where were we?

570
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:30,136
Yeah! He bashed me before Sulochana.

571
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,972
He claims that Sulochana belongs to him.

572
00:37:34,234 --> 00:37:35,667
As if I give up so easily!

573
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:40,706
Even Sulochana likes me dude.

574
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,776
Why would she stop Poorna
from bashing me otherwise?

575
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:46,955
She is crazy about Ramana.

576
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:50,424
It was because of me.

577
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:55,064
When she was close to me,
I couldn't control myself.

578
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,233
So, I kissed her.

579
00:37:57,761 --> 00:38:01,073
Nothing wrong in getting
thrashed daily to get such a kiss.

580
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,124
But Suri...
[knock knock]

581
00:38:07,331 --> 00:38:08,983
Hey Suri
[knock knock]

00:38:11,378 --> 00:38:14,659
Hey Suri...
[knock knock]

583
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,827
Hey Suri...
[knock knock]

584
00:38:20,222 --> 00:38:23,764
Hey idiot! Why do you make
sounds instead of coming before me?

585
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:31,507
Are you a ghost?
[knock knock]

586
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:34,173
So you aren't a human?
[knock knock]

[phone ringing]

588
00:38:51,102 --> 00:38:53,580
-Hello.
-It's me, Suri.

589
00:38:53,657 --> 00:38:54,352
Tell me.

590
00:38:54,725 --> 00:38:57,122
Last night, you were telling
about someone bashing you.

591
00:38:57,214 --> 00:38:59,374
It was Poorna.
Didn't I tell you last night?

592
00:38:59,557 --> 00:39:02,307
When did you tell me? I was on the
line and you didn't talk at all.

593
00:39:02,714 --> 00:39:05,995
-Haven't I told you, man?
-Whom did you tell? Try to remember.

594
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:09,139
Hey Suri, I told you, didn't I?
[knock knock]

595
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:19,889
-Suri, I will call you back. Hang up.-Okay dude

596

598
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:01,904
Hello.

599
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:03,384
-Hello Suri-Tell me.

600
00:40:03,576 --> 00:40:04,200
[knock knock]

601
00:40:07,854 --> 00:40:10,599
When I was calling you,
some kind of knocking sounds are coming.

602
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:12,119
Is it a ghost?

603
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:15,024
Is it a ghost or a demon?
Are you still having a hangover?

604
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,365
Hey, I am telling the truth.

605
00:40:17,076 --> 00:40:21,158
Please stop it. Actually, I
called you to tell something.

606
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,829
My niece in Hyderabad got engaged.

607
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:26,421
I'm leaving to Hyderabad tomorrow
and would stay there for a few days.

608
00:40:26,745 --> 00:40:28,002
Take care. Bye.

609
00:40:28,405 --> 00:40:29,278
Hey...

610
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:38,660

[knock knock]

612
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:43,693
Who are you?

613
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:48,685
Are you a ghost?

00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:49,675

I am very hungry.

00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:20,258
Don't ghosts come at night?

621
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,533
Don't you have a sense of time?

622
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:38,492
What is your name?

623
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,274
Why do you respond when I call Suri?

624
00:42:46,151 --> 00:42:49,145
Is your name... Suri?

625
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,425
[knock knock]

626
00:42:57,932 --> 00:42:59,596
I understood one thing
about your knocking sounds.

627
00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:04,492
You knock twice for 'yes'

628
00:43:05,132 --> 00:43:06,988
and once for 'no', ain't it?

629
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:07,903
[knock knock]

630
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:09,854
It is...

631
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:21,463
Are you a good ghost
or a tormenting one?

632
00:43:24,647 --> 00:43:27,171
Oh no! I am scared
when I think about ghosts.

633
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,133
Let's consider you a soul.

634
00:43:32,814 --> 00:43:34,399
Okay?
[knock knock]

635
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:40,023
Thank God! Now, I am feeling relieved.

636
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:41,956
I am not scared anymore.

00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:43,403

638
00:43:49,441 --> 00:43:50,907
Seems like you laughed?

[knock knock]

640
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:00,544
How old are you? 25?

641
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:01,399
[knock]

642
00:44:03,022 --> 00:44:04,732
21 or 22?

644
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:06,774

00:44:09,076 --> 00:44:11,846
Oh! You are here?
[knock knock]

647
00:44:19,017 --> 00:44:21,338
Aren't you a college student?
How did you die?

648
00:44:22,098 --> 00:44:22,877
Was it an accident?

649
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:23,565
[knock]

650
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:28,469
Did someone scold you
for scoring less marks?

[knock]

652
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:34,153
Oh man! If someone didn't harm
you... Did you die on your own?

653
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:34,988
[knock knock]

654
00:44:38,147 --> 00:44:40,048
Does it mean suicide?

655
00:44:40,256 --> 00:44:40,944
[knock knock]

656
00:44:42,354 --> 00:44:42,944
Oh God!

657
00:44:43,168 --> 00:44:45,983
Would you possess me as shown in movies?
[knock]

658
00:44:48,823 --> 00:44:50,888
I asked because I have my own fears.

659
00:44:53,097 --> 00:44:55,506
By the way, why did you die?

660
00:44:56,984 --> 00:44:57,550
Is it love?

661
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:58,430
[knock knock]

662
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:03,489
Expected that. What could be
there other than love at that age?

663
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:07,405
I was scared initially but...

664
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,421
I feel pity for you Suri.

665
00:45:10,484 --> 00:45:13,481
I was talking informally. Is it alright?

666
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,281
[knock knock]

667
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:16,655
Thanks dude.

668
00:45:17,255 --> 00:45:21,528
After I left my village, I have no
friends for casual talks except that kid

669
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:24,473
Even if Suri is not with me,
I am happy that you are.

670
00:45:25,288 --> 00:45:27,632
I was the one who over-acted
while leaving my village

671
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:32,414
As Suri sticks with me all the time.

672
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:34,172
Never mind.
You bumped into me and have the same name.

673
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:37,059
I mean you got to know you.

674
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:39,192
We are friends from now.

675
00:45:39,715 --> 00:45:40,164
Okay?

Hey...

00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,350
What happened to you?

681
00:46:02,622 --> 00:46:04,725
Are you not having food
properly being busy with work?

682
00:46:06,532 --> 00:46:07,081
Hey...

Look at him.

00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:24,327
O God, bless our family.

00:46:25,484 --> 00:46:27,261
Where did I place the curry leaves?

688
00:46:29,598 --> 00:46:30,908
What happened to him?
Has he lost it?

689
00:46:30,994 --> 00:46:33,495
-How can you say that to your son?
-You keep feeding that glutton.

690
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:34,374
Enough.

691
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:36,801
Hey! Be careful. Go slowly.

692
00:46:37,053 --> 00:46:37,550

00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:45,429
Hey Suri, I saw Sulochana just now.

695
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,290
I am very happy today.

696
00:46:48,354 --> 00:46:52,660
Since that incident, I feel embarrased
to go to the centre or meet Sulochana.

00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,176
Anyhow Sulochana likes me.

698
00:46:55,548 --> 00:46:58,961
Still, does everyone
face so many troubles?

699
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:02,941
I think you have faced similar troubles
like me for the sake of love, right?

700
00:47:03,034 --> 00:47:04,045
[knock knock]

701
00:47:04,419 --> 00:47:05,939
I too want to know about your love story.

702
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:08,668
Why didn't you ever
narrate your love story?

703
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:12,661
What would you say anyhow?

704
00:47:13,173 --> 00:47:16,017
I'll make you speak the truth. "Tuneega
Tuneega song from Manasantha Nuvve movie"

705
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:17,610
There are all the
Telugu love movies in this.

706
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,279
I will start narrating one by one.
Just answer yes or no. Okay?

707
00:47:20,511 --> 00:47:21,201
[knock knock]

708
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,516
Is it a childhood love story like
the movie 'Manasantha Nuvve'?

709
00:47:33,682 --> 00:47:34,155
[knock]

710
00:47:35,858 --> 00:47:37,154
So not that.

711
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:41,792
[music]

712
00:47:44,068 --> 00:47:46,266
Is it a college love story
like the movie 'Prema Desam'?

713
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:46,820
[music]

714
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,852
Musthafa Musthafa...
What a wonderful song it is!

715
00:47:52,563 --> 00:47:54,555
Suri and I like this song very much.

716
00:47:55,484 --> 00:47:57,531
We used to halt wherever we
heard this song during childhood.

717
00:47:58,612 --> 00:48:01,285
We used to stay
there till the song ends.

718
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:06,037
I love this song and Suri so much.

719
00:48:07,883 --> 00:48:09,287
Do you have a friend similar to him?

720
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,200
[knock knock]

721
00:48:11,172 --> 00:48:12,673
Is it a favourite song for both of you?

722
00:48:12,869 --> 00:48:13,446
[knock knock]

723
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:19,810
[music]

724
00:48:27,298 --> 00:48:29,357
Ramana presents Suri's love story.

725
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,150
My name is Suresh.

726
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:32,906
I fell in love with a Muslim girl.

727
00:48:33,383 --> 00:48:35,630
I fell for her on the day of Ramzan
when I saw her in a tinsel dress.

728
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,128
I imagined that scene in
this way. What do you say?

729
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:42,763
One day, I met her at the
mosque and proposed her.

730
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:46,818
She scolded me in their language.
I didn't take that road after that.

731
00:48:47,746 --> 00:48:49,205
Later, she came to attend a fair.

732
00:48:50,734 --> 00:48:54,262
I lent her 50 bucks when she had
insufficient amount to buy bangles.

733
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:56,051
Despite she had no interest in me,

734
00:48:56,059 --> 00:48:57,379
she accepted that amount
because of her fascination for bangles.

735
00:48:58,015 --> 00:48:59,396
After that, our conversation synced.

736
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:01,956
One day, when I was on
the bed due to high fever,

737
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:04,525
She brought an amulet from
the Dargah and tied it to me.

738
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:08,756
I don't know whether it was the power
of the amulet or her entry in my home,

739
00:49:09,587 --> 00:49:10,916
The fever went down by the next morning.

740
00:49:12,057 --> 00:49:15,411
When I was passing by her lane
during Dusshera procession,

741
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:16,979
She even kissed me.

742
00:49:18,553 --> 00:49:20,508
Hey Suri, you were lucky.

743
00:49:21,172 --> 00:49:23,217
I got slapped just for one kiss.

744
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,245
[knocking]

745
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:27,073
Hey, don't laugh.

746
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:31,245
After that, we loved
each other so madly that,

747
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:34,558
I used to take
medicines when she fell ill.

748
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:38,142
I felt no hunger and sleep if I
couldn't see her for even a day.

749
00:49:41,803 --> 00:49:43,293
When I was in dire need of money,

750
00:49:43,757 --> 00:49:45,634
She arranged money by
selling her gold bangles

751
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,474
and told her parents that she lost them.

752
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:51,459
They came to know about me when
they felt suspicious and inquired.

753
00:49:52,343 --> 00:49:54,959
Sadly, she was beaten
and confined her to home.

754
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,260
I came to know about
that and went to her home.

755
00:49:57,984 --> 00:50:00,472
Everyone in that lane thrashed me badly.

756
00:50:01,872 --> 00:50:05,515
Meanwhile, she saw me and threatened them
she would cut her hand if they don't stop.

757
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:07,625
Then, they left me.

758
00:50:09,064 --> 00:50:11,216
But we were unable to leave each other.

759
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:17,669
I couldn't concentrate on studies as
the girl didn't eat food for 15 days.

760
00:50:19,274 --> 00:50:23,716
She was admitted in hospital.
And I was unable to take it anymore.

761
00:50:25,597 --> 00:50:28,045
I went to her and brought her out at the
time when there were no nurses around.

762
00:50:30,384 --> 00:50:33,161
Both of us understood
that we can't live together.

763
00:50:35,797 --> 00:50:40,669
We felt that there would be happiness in
dying together when we can't live together

764
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:44,556
So, we brought poison.

765
00:50:47,397 --> 00:50:49,540
She kissed me for the second
time before we took poison.

766
00:50:51,738 --> 00:50:52,774
I felt her kiss was like ambrosia.

767
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:59,415
Now, we didn't feel the
bitterness of poison and drank it.

768
00:51:01,915 --> 00:51:02,627
[gasping]

769
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,699
Why am I crying when it's
me who has written it, Suri?

770
00:51:10,582 --> 00:51:11,590
I am becoming emotional dude.

771
00:51:20,492 --> 00:51:21,708
Aren't you weeping too?

772
00:51:22,118 --> 00:51:23,338
[knock knock]

773
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:28,976
Does this glass belong to you?

774
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:29,907
[knock knock]

775
00:51:30,107 --> 00:51:30,932
[chuckling]

776
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:33,192
I found this here.

777
00:51:36,966 --> 00:51:37,874
Cheers dude!

778
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:47,780
[music]

779
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:56,956
Hey,
did you drink the poison in this glass?

780
00:51:57,337 --> 00:51:57,880
[knock knock]

781
00:52:00,272 --> 00:52:01,597
Hey idiot!

782
00:52:01,937 --> 00:52:05,305
Is that the reason the air flowed heavily
every time I drink alcohol in this glass?

783
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:08,757
You thought that I was also
drinking poison, didn't you?

784
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:13,617
But Suri, whatever it is,

785
00:52:14,023 --> 00:52:16,335
I feel very jealous of you
after knowing your love story.

786
00:52:19,201 --> 00:52:22,322
Both of you died in order to
persevere your love, didn't you?

787
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:22,992
[knock]

788
00:52:25,745 --> 00:52:27,138
Both of you died, didn't you?

789
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:28,365
[knock]

790
00:52:30,957 --> 00:52:32,085
Is she alive?

791
00:52:32,712 --> 00:52:33,357
[knock knock]

792
00:52:35,309 --> 00:52:36,429
Where is she now?

793
00:52:39,338 --> 00:52:40,522
You can't answer, right?

794
00:52:42,149 --> 00:52:44,310
But still... Hey...

795
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:48,123
You have love also has honesty in it.

796
00:52:48,146 --> 00:52:49,350
But I don't have that in mine.

797
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:54,559
Damn! We have to love like you did!

798
00:52:55,056 --> 00:52:55,593
I will do that!

799
00:52:59,812 --> 00:53:01,860
I'll keep her in my heart always.

800
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:04,698
Right here.

801
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:11,753
[music]
[waves splashing]

802
00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:16,834
Where are you?

803
00:53:17,034 --> 00:53:21,003
Where will I be? I don't know where
to go, so I am sitting at the center.

804
00:53:21,393 --> 00:53:22,698
It is very embarassing brother.

805
00:53:23,487 --> 00:53:27,252
Everyone here is speaking ill of
you due to Sulochana sister's episode.

806
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:30,396
Yes, I too feel embarrased to come there.

807
00:53:30,532 --> 00:53:31,233
So, I am not.

808
00:53:31,786 --> 00:53:32,646
That's why I didn't call you...

809
00:53:32,755 --> 00:53:37,442
...even when Sulochana sister
went to the temple before me.

810
00:53:37,742 --> 00:53:38,694
What? She went to the temple?

811
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,718
[temple bell ringing]

812
00:53:43,536 --> 00:53:44,972
[whistling]

813
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:51,463
-Dear Sulochana
-Yes Mr Priest

814
00:53:51,471 --> 00:53:52,367
-What is this?
-Prasada

815
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,128
Why are you distributing
Prasada at this time dear?

816
00:53:55,449 --> 00:53:57,024
They are done in the morning itself.

817
00:53:57,881 --> 00:54:00,701
There would some people outside
the temple. Distribute to them.

818
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:02,765
-Okay?
-Okay.

819
00:54:06,508 --> 00:54:07,253
What can we do now?

820
00:54:07,879 --> 00:54:09,732
You didn't listen when your mom
asked you to come in the morning.

821
00:54:09,932 --> 00:54:12,171
As told by the priest,
no one would come now.

822
00:54:12,524 --> 00:54:15,006
Mom will scold me if I
don't distribute it now.

823
00:54:15,206 --> 00:54:17,153
Let's see. Somebody might turn up.

824
00:54:18,674 --> 00:54:21,132
-Why aren't the chicks coming back?
-They would come eventually.

825
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:28,728
Oh no! Me? Would the youth stay calm if
a beauty like me distributes the Prasada?

826
00:54:28,804 --> 00:54:31,819
-Oh my God!
-Please... Please distribute it.

827
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,594
-Please...
-No, I can't

828
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:41,028
Ramana...
Over here.

829
00:54:41,735 --> 00:54:43,271
-Me?
-Yes.

830
00:54:50,368 --> 00:54:52,608
Actually, Sulochana's
mom made this Prasada.

831
00:54:53,784 --> 00:54:56,016
There are no people
here to distribute this.

832
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,228
Kindly distribute it
to the people outside.

833
00:55:03,906 --> 00:55:04,934
Are you mad?

834
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,743
Chill! He came to flirt you
but we are using him.

835
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:10,266
What's wrong in it?

836
00:55:10,815 --> 00:55:15,137
[music]

837
00:55:15,742 --> 00:55:17,251
Hey children, come here.

838
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:20,697
Give it to me too brother.

839
00:55:27,034 --> 00:55:27,866
They have left.

840
00:55:28,265 --> 00:55:30,489
If you give me the bucket,
I will deliver it to them.

841
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:34,222
When did you come?

842
00:55:35,279 --> 00:55:36,175
Just after you.

843
00:55:37,105 --> 00:55:39,234
Didn't you abruptly disconnect the
call when I told you about the temple?

844
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:42,458
By the way, Sulochana sister
asked me to convey her thanks.

845
00:55:42,658 --> 00:55:43,494
-To me?
-Yes.

846
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:46,390
She conveyed it with little anger.

847
00:55:47,602 --> 00:55:49,273
This is the reason they
have bashed you on that day.

848
00:55:49,563 --> 00:55:50,435
Have a little control.

849
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:55,746
Thank God! What would you have
done if she told you directly?

850
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,496
[music]

851
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:02,125
"Waking up before the rooster"

852
00:56:02,414 --> 00:56:04,878
"Applying soap on the dark body"

853
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:07,634
"The boy jumped out of shyness"

854
00:56:07,834 --> 00:56:09,721
"and laughed crazily"

855
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:12,853
"He wore sunglasses and
looked like a superstar"

856
00:56:13,057 --> 00:56:15,572
"He groomed his hair and
looked like a stylish star"

857
00:56:15,845 --> 00:56:18,166
"He applied talcum powder
and looked like a power star"

858
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:20,187
"He fell in love"

859
00:56:21,113 --> 00:56:23,611
"He stepped on a fox tail somewhere"

860
00:56:23,835 --> 00:56:26,011
"after looking at the beautiful damsel"

861
00:56:26,347 --> 00:56:31,600
"Won't he see the stars in
daylight when he grabs the moon?"

862
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:34,438
Yes, we have Hilsa. Take it.

863
00:56:37,988 --> 00:56:38,524
The motorcycle?

864
00:56:38,754 --> 00:56:40,566
Hey, where is my motorcycle?

865
00:56:40,766 --> 00:56:41,895
Ramana might have taken it.

866
00:56:42,095 --> 00:56:44,936
He is not talking to me since 2 years
but he wants my motorcycle. Idiot!

867
00:56:45,136 --> 00:56:46,671
Shameless moron!

868
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:52,078

I am working in a photo

-The oldie coconut trader is ill.
-You mean Abbulu grandpa?

912
00:59:17,893 --> 00:59:20,091
Yes. Your father asked
us to pay him a visit.

913
00:59:20,817 --> 00:59:22,347
Why didn't dad tell this in the morning?

914
00:59:22,746 --> 00:59:23,934

Grandpa, it's me, Sulochana,
daughter of Jaya Babu.

919
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:47,790
Oh! Is it?
I have a bad vision these days.

Oh! Both of you came together!
Did you bring a wedding invitation?

923
00:59:58,128 --> 01:00:00,728
No, grandpa. We heard that you
were ill. So we came to visit you.

God bless you my child!

Granny has been to milk booth. Meanwhile,
make some tea for your brother-in-law.

Okay. What about you?

927
01:00:08,415 --> 01:00:11,966
Listen, prepare it with excess
sugar before your granny arrives.

When will you marry her?

01:00:24,481 --> 01:00:25,996
It's been 5 years since she matured.

932
01:00:26,196 --> 01:00:28,200

It is very aggressive.

936
01:00:41,366 --> 01:00:43,755
Yes, because we have a
stiff the competition now.

937
01:00:43,975 --> 01:00:47,118

just one mill for 4 to 5 villages.

I will come in the evening. You can go.

I will bring her with me in the
evening when I come to your village.

This haste would bring you trouble.

It's not good if Mr Jaya Babu
comes to know about that.

They have raised her well, didn't they?

I will marry her even
if I have to lock her parents.

I will not leave her.

She wants to attend college along
with her friends from tomorrow.

01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,005
It is not a good practice
to keep a girl confined

I won't spare you. What's the reason?

Oh God!

987
01:03:49,157 --> 01:03:50,399

brother-in-law's henchmen.

-Are you insane?

Why did you send your men again?

990
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:01,033
I would have informed either you or
my dad if he had done something.

991
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:04,661
Won't you let me be at
peace at my college?

Hey Sulochana...

997
01:04:20,103 --> 01:04:20,675
Tell her dude.

998
01:04:21,142 --> 01:04:23,028
What the hell is there to
tell? Who the hell are you?

999
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:24,649
He is my friend.

1000
01:04:24,749 --> 01:04:26,892
Only such idiots can
be friends to people like you.

1001
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:30,507
I slapped you,
my brother-in-law bashed you too.

1002
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:33,772
But still, you are following
me like the shameless dog.

1003
01:04:34,816 --> 01:04:36,607
I am not someone like
you who is easy going like you.

1004
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:37,665
I am pursuing my studies.

1005

Both you and my
brother-in-law on the other side.

1006

Why don't the two of you kill me?

1007
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:43,451
Don't you compare me with
your brother-in-law, Sulochana.

1008
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:44,194
I sure will!

1009
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:47,189
He is a useless moron and
you are an irresponsible idiot.

1010
01:04:47,594 --> 01:04:48,247
Both are same.

1011
01:04:48,472 --> 01:04:49,570
Don't push it Sulochana.

1012
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:51,455
Sulochana, he told me
everything yesterday.

1013
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:53,053
Who the hell are you?

1014
01:04:54,176 --> 01:04:56,128
Have you been spreading
the entire village about me?

1015
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:58,029
If you follow me again,

1016
01:04:58,229 --> 01:05:00,289
It won't be my brother-in-law
who would hit you but me.

1017
01:05:00,982 --> 01:05:02,189
Listen to me Sulochana

1018
01:05:02,673 --> 01:05:05,093
Stop. Don't you follow me.

1019
01:05:05,617 --> 01:05:06,433
I plead you.

1020
01:05:11,886 --> 01:05:12,615
So be it, your majesty.

1021
01:05:12,934 --> 01:05:15,463
Respected Sulochana, I will neither
follow you nor show you my face.

1022

You live happily.

1023
01:05:18,026 --> 01:05:19,063
He would again do that someday.

Oh my freaking life!

1025
01:05:21,624 --> 01:05:24,646
I was a fool to follow you
and get insulted,

1026
01:05:25,694 --> 01:05:30,682
bashed by some fellows and was still
following you like a dog as you said.

1027
01:05:33,015 --> 01:05:34,263
There would be no more trouble from me.

1028

01:06:54,526 --> 01:06:57,363
-By the way, is the seat soft?
-Yes.

1045
01:06:59,388 --> 01:07:02,509
I have made it done at
Kakinada in Basha's store on credit.

1046
01:07:03,574 --> 01:07:04,750
You are comfortable, aren't you?

1047
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:05,733
Yes.

1048
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,291
[tires screeching]

1049
01:07:08,499 --> 01:07:09,832
What happened? Did the fuel run empty?

1050
01:07:10,431 --> 01:07:11,786
Gandhi made my tank full recently.

1051
01:07:12,026 --> 01:07:12,768
You give me 50 bucks.

1052
01:07:13,801 --> 01:07:14,793
Is it for the ride?

1053
01:07:15,135 --> 01:07:17,343
Basha warned me that he would take
away the seat if I don't pay him.

1054
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:18,758
So why would I have to pay?

1055
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,234
Aren't you sitting on that seat?

1056
01:07:22,588 --> 01:07:23,390
You...

1057
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:24,903
You should have informed
first that it wasn't a free ride.

1058
01:07:25,507 --> 01:07:27,683
All the people of this
village know my way.

1059
01:07:28,207 --> 01:07:30,144
It is 25 bucks till here and 50
bucks to get into the village.

1060
01:07:30,488 --> 01:07:31,521
Are you coming with
me or staying back?

1061
01:07:35,362 --> 01:07:36,969
-Move it.
-Give me the cash.

1062
01:07:37,743 --> 01:07:38,488
I will pay after I get down.

1063
01:07:39,129 --> 01:07:41,457
Dude, does the same thing
work in a bus or a train?

1064
01:07:44,544 --> 01:07:44,995
That's better.

1065
01:07:49,616 --> 01:07:50,954
Your technique is nice.

1066
01:07:51,874 --> 01:07:55,326
Making a ride comfortable
and then asking for money.

1067
01:07:55,548 --> 01:07:57,219
It's just the blessing of people like you.

1068
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:00,596
It's our sheer innocense actually.

1069
01:08:01,434 --> 01:08:03,578
By the way, whom do you want
to visit in this village?

1070
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,570
Why? Would you ask money for even that?

1071
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,878
I'm commercial but not a moron.

1072
01:08:08,414 --> 01:08:09,302
I came to visit a friend's home.

1073
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,719
What's his name?

1074
01:08:10,919 --> 01:08:12,799
[phone ringing]
He is Su...

1075
01:08:14,645 --> 01:08:16,241
Hold it near my ear dude. It's
difficult to drive with a single hand.

1076
01:08:19,112 --> 01:08:20,962
-Hello-Laxman Rao, where are you?

1077
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:23,260
I'm with a client dude. I'll be
there after I drop him in a village.

1078
01:08:23,476 --> 01:08:25,252
Didn't I tell you be there
at the time of bus arrival?

1079
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,825
Chill dude.
I'll be there in two... 10 minutes.

1080
01:08:28,019 --> 01:08:29,352
Two tens is equal to 20 minutes.

1081
01:08:29,798 --> 01:08:31,146
Have a smoke till then. I'll be there.

1082
01:08:31,387 --> 01:08:33,592
You snatched 100 bucks from
me on the name of advance.

1083
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:34,685
If I announce this in the village,

1084
01:08:34,885 --> 01:08:37,214
-not even a child would board your bike.
-Okay, hang up. I am coming back for you.

1085
01:08:40,546 --> 01:08:43,459
If you walk straightly in this way for
half kilometre, you will reach the village

1086
01:08:43,659 --> 01:08:45,041
Why should I walk after
I paid you 50 bucks?

1087
01:08:45,297 --> 01:08:47,569
Your logic is right but
my cousin is waiting.

1088
01:08:47,889 --> 01:08:48,654
He cannot walk because he is a cripple.

1089
01:08:49,188 --> 01:08:50,405
I'm emotionally tied.
Sorry, don't mind.

1090
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:58,484
If you come next time,
I will give you a free ride till half way.

1091
01:08:58,684 --> 01:08:59,273
Okay?

1092
01:08:59,473 --> 01:09:05,154
[music]

1093
01:09:10,426 --> 01:09:13,779
Hey Suri, they've shocked me
before I set foot in your village.

1094
01:09:14,134 --> 01:09:16,150
I don't know what happens
once I step into the village!

"Chethilona Cheyyesi song

Give me a cigarette bro.

1097
01:09:37,983 --> 01:09:40,113
Bro, a friend of mine named
Suresh used to live in this village.

1098
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:42,130
-His friends...
-Which Suresh were you asking for?

1099
01:09:42,518 --> 01:09:44,575
Gedhal Suresh or Matta Suresh?

1100
01:09:46,575 --> 01:09:47,592
No, I was looking for Surigadu.

1101
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:48,810
Hey, are you looking for Surigadu?

1102
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:52,125
That idiot just left in this way after
he bought a stack of beedi on credit.

1103
01:09:52,698 --> 01:09:53,868
By the way,
what work do you have with him?

1104
01:09:56,107 --> 01:09:58,302
I have some work with his friend, not him.

1105
01:09:58,496 --> 01:09:59,105
Who are you?

1106
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:01,508
I'm Surigadu's friend.

1107
01:10:01,837 --> 01:10:04,466
Which village are you from?
What's the matter with you?

1108
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:05,779
No bro.

1109
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:09,379
My friend Suri and the one you
are referring to are different.

1110
01:10:10,568 --> 01:10:13,152
He is from Kovvur.
Everyone addresses him as Surigadu.

1111
01:10:13,884 --> 01:10:16,491
I have to meet his friend
who was his classmate.

1112
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:18,998
-Did you get it?
-It is pretty clear after you explained.

1113
01:10:19,877 --> 01:10:23,190
There is a rice mill in the south of
this village. You can find him there.

1114
01:10:26,558 --> 01:10:27,595
-Thanks bro.
-Welcome.

1115
01:10:30,341 --> 01:10:32,615
Who the hell is he? I didn't
understand anything he said.

1116
01:10:32,822 --> 01:10:34,409
As if I did!

1117
01:10:34,641 --> 01:10:37,404
All the educated youth gather at the
rice mill and watch cricket, don't they?

1118
01:10:37,819 --> 01:10:40,134
I sent him there as he might find the
guy he was looking for in that gathering.

1120

We have a wicket in this over.

1121
01:10:48,537 --> 01:10:50,797
Steady.
Come one by one.

1122
01:10:51,058 --> 01:10:54,509
Hey, wait! What's your amount?

1123
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:57,972
Hey, careful!

1124
01:10:58,991 --> 01:11:02,657
Hand me the cash.
Do you think I am a fool?

1125
01:11:03,358 --> 01:11:05,833
-Police! Run! Run!
-Why did you come here?

1126

[water rustling]

1137
01:12:48,722 --> 01:12:51,261
He didn't tell anything
before his death but

1138
01:12:51,994 --> 01:12:53,219
Did he ask you to apologise to me?

1139
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,470
Our Suri is a freaking fool dude!

1140
01:12:56,226 --> 01:12:58,698
-But he is deceased now.
-That's the reason for my anguish!

1141
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:04,233
Why don't you forgive him dude?

1142
01:13:04,678 --> 01:13:06,281
Sure, we can do that dude.

1143
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:10,269
But I would have done if he wouldn't have
been my benchmate and become my friend.

1144
01:13:11,597 --> 01:13:15,108
The day when my father absconded
leaving me and my mom to severe debts,

1145
01:13:15,316 --> 01:13:16,813
We were on the verge of committing suicide

1146
01:13:17,069 --> 01:13:19,836
but he came like a
hero and gave us courage.

1147
01:13:19,936 --> 01:13:21,135
I would have forgiven him
if he didn't do that dude.

1148
01:13:24,262 --> 01:13:26,732
I wanted to commit suicide
again when my mother died.

1149
01:13:26,932 --> 01:13:29,887
If he wouldn't have come to me and said,

1150
01:13:29,979 --> 01:13:30,825
I would have forgiven him.

1151
01:13:33,971 --> 01:13:36,955
After that, when he committed
suicide and made me an orphan,

1152
01:13:37,368 --> 01:13:39,192
I didn't feel like dying.
I was enraged dude.

1153
01:13:41,983 --> 01:13:42,566
Even now,

1154
01:13:42,774 --> 01:13:45,735
I won't get emotional remembering
my mom but I do remembering him.

1155
01:13:45,935 --> 01:13:48,075
[weeping]

1156
01:13:49,393 --> 01:13:52,399
I can't forgive him dude. I would
forget that idiot if I forgive him.

1157
01:13:52,778 --> 01:13:53,744
I don't want that.

1158
01:13:56,326 --> 01:13:58,431
I'm very emotional now
because Suri is my close friend,

1159
01:13:58,631 --> 01:14:01,268
But this guy,
Balaraju is an arch-rival of Suri.

1160
01:14:01,556 --> 01:14:02,633
Ask him if he would forgive Suri?

1161
01:14:03,303 --> 01:14:04,951
Why do you still hold a
grudge after his death?

1162
01:14:05,603 --> 01:14:08,216
He killed me too with his death.

1163
01:14:09,376 --> 01:14:14,615
Everyone in the college including
juniors, seniors, lecturers, professors

1164
01:14:15,347 --> 01:14:16,851
know my rivalry with Suri.

1165
01:14:17,635 --> 01:14:22,217
If you ask anyone about Suri,
they used to remember me and vice-versa.

1166
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:23,409
Now, he is dead.

1167
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:28,855
There is no one to fight
with me or remember me.

1168
01:14:29,902 --> 01:14:31,562
He took my identity along with him.

1169
01:14:34,027 --> 01:14:35,255
I will never forgive him.

1170
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:38,216
I used to think of how he
would fight me when I see him.

1171
01:14:40,984 --> 01:14:43,725
But I never expected that he would
give a death blow with his suicide.

1172
01:14:46,071 --> 01:14:46,847
Concentrate on your drink dude.

1173
01:14:47,311 --> 01:14:48,962
Anyone would turn this
way if he bumps into someone.

1174
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,010
He marked his impression on
us and took away our identity.

1175
01:14:52,372 --> 01:14:53,188
Freaking moron!

1176
01:14:53,825 --> 01:14:55,914
But dude, I understood
one thing because of him.

1177
01:14:56,114 --> 01:14:57,063
Friendship doesn't mean just love.

1178
01:14:57,263 --> 01:14:59,469
It is a blend of anger,
grudge, enmity and jealousy.

1179
01:14:59,897 --> 01:15:03,775
Because if we remember any
person with any of these feelings,

1180
01:15:03,975 --> 01:15:04,884
That means he is our friend.

1181
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:06,984
How the hell can you call him as a friend?

1182
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:11,082
He faced me like a man in
college but died for a mere girl.

1183
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:13,844
His friendship is of some other kind.

1184
01:15:14,444 --> 01:15:17,004
Didn't I tell you that he is
doing fine after his death?

1185
01:15:17,334 --> 01:15:18,999
But he is torturing us in the
form of his remembrance every day.

1186
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:22,472
Suri, amongst the people
that I met for you.

1187
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,488
No one said ill about you.

1188
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:27,667
Perhaps, everyone
becomes good after death.

1189
01:15:28,085 --> 01:15:30,164
If people consider a human to
be good even when he is alive,

1190
01:15:30,601 --> 01:15:33,670
I guess there wouldn't be any necessity
for anyone in this world to die forcefully

1191
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:35,140
You are making us emotional dude.

1192
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:42,930
Where are Suri's parents now?

1193
01:15:43,245 --> 01:15:44,727
They left their home and
are residing in another village.

1194
01:15:45,431 --> 01:15:46,348
Will you drop me?

1195
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:49,452
When I'm going on a
motorcycle in this way

1196
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:52,997
I remember my trip to Sai's village

1197
01:15:53,957 --> 01:15:55,941
after I told Sulochana
that I would never meet her.

1198
01:15:58,566 --> 01:16:01,835
What's up Ramana? Why did you
come to my village all of a sudden?

1199
01:16:02,103 --> 01:16:02,635
Is it love?

1200
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:07,002
Got you!
That's the reason I brought you here.

1201
01:16:08,056 --> 01:16:11,016
-A girl named Sulochana.
-Wow! Beautiful name.

1202
01:16:11,496 --> 01:16:13,622
Even the girl is very
beautiful. They are rich too.

1203
01:16:13,898 --> 01:16:16,013
-Is it? Did she fall for you?
-Yeah.

1204
01:16:16,449 --> 01:16:17,773
Then, what's the worry about?

1205
01:16:19,411 --> 01:16:20,324
She is not letting her feeling out.

1206
01:16:20,524 --> 01:16:22,142
[motorcycle arrived]

1207
01:16:24,969 --> 01:16:26,018
Mom, we are here.

1208
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:27,636
Did you prepare egg curry as I said?

1209
01:16:27,961 --> 01:16:29,197
Yes I did.

1210
01:16:29,397 --> 01:16:31,094
wash your feet and
enter. I will serve the food.

1211
01:16:33,538 --> 01:16:35,546
So you came here telling that
you wouldn't ever show your face?

1212
01:16:36,413 --> 01:16:39,165
I have said those words but...
my heart is craving dude.

1213
01:16:39,612 --> 01:16:40,761
You would feel that initially

1214
01:16:41,049 --> 01:16:42,362
but everything will be
alright after a few days.

1215
01:16:42,618 --> 01:16:43,491
I can't take this anymore.

1216
01:16:43,874 --> 01:16:46,356
I would have at least seen her from
a distance if I was in her village.

1217
01:16:46,777 --> 01:16:49,694
But I don't know that it would be painful
if I go far away from her in this way.

1218
01:16:50,056 --> 01:16:51,353
Now that you have come here, let's see.

1219
01:16:52,463 --> 01:16:55,142
-Let's see.
-I said the same thing, didn't I?

1220
01:16:55,587 --> 01:16:57,429
-I want to see now.
-What will you see?

1221
01:16:57,938 --> 01:17:00,015
I have to see Sulochana. I'm going.

1222
01:17:00,607 --> 01:17:02,295
Hey! At this time?

1223
01:17:02,675 --> 01:17:04,328
There would be auto-rickshaws of the
late night shows at the main road

1224
01:17:04,561 --> 01:17:07,024
Are you nuts? You can go in
the morning. Sleep now.

1225
01:17:07,852 --> 01:17:10,315
-It's a different feeling inside.
-That's common.

1226
01:17:10,755 --> 01:17:13,162
I'll show you my girlfriend in the
morning. You can go after that.

1227
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:18,244
Hey Sai,
I can't believe that you fell in love.

1228
01:17:18,589 --> 01:17:21,327
It happened recently bro.
We've been for a movie too.

1229
01:17:21,609 --> 01:17:24,657
-Oh! You are rocking bro!
-Yeah!

1230
01:17:25,486 --> 01:17:28,082
-What's her name?
-Her name is...

1231

[music]

1232
01:17:35,048 --> 01:17:36,758
-Hey, it's Sulochana!
-Radha Kumari.

1233
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:39,811
-Hey, it's Sulochana!
-No, it's Radha Kumari dude.

1234
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:41,310
Hey, look there, it's Sulochana.

1235
01:17:43,817 --> 01:17:47,065
The girl is in pink
saree is my Radha Kumari.

1236
01:17:47,498 --> 01:17:48,022
Oh!

1237
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,902
The girl is in white dress is Sulochana.

1238
01:17:54,281 --> 01:17:55,641
Even your lover is beautiful dude!

1239
01:17:56,126 --> 01:17:57,071
Why did she come to this village?

1240
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,173
Maybe she came for you.

1241
01:18:00,077 --> 01:18:00,723
That might be not the case dude.

1242
01:18:05,715 --> 01:18:11,647
[music]

1243
01:18:21,688 --> 01:18:24,243
Hey... they have built
a big church over there.

[temple bell ringing]

1245
01:18:30,781 --> 01:18:31,765
-Dude
-Yes.

1246
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:36,238
-Who is that beside Sulochana?
-Padma, second daughter of Mr Subbaraju.

1247
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:37,522
Her wedding is in 4 days.

1248
01:18:38,906 --> 01:18:41,130
-So Sulochana came to attend her wedding.
-Yeah.

1249
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:43,910
Then I would stay here.

1250
01:18:45,009 --> 01:18:46,750
-How about a beer tonight?
-Absolutely.

1251
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:53,045

1253
01:19:03,756 --> 01:19:05,453
Dude, did they come out?

1254
01:19:08,303 --> 01:19:10,698
-Go man! Go.
-Okay!

1255
01:19:10,898 --> 01:19:12,735
-Sister, I'll come later. Carry on.
-Okay.

1256

[motorcycle leaving]

1257
01:19:20,642 --> 01:19:21,498
How are you?

1258
01:19:21,698 --> 01:19:22,896
We need to talk. Come with me.

1259
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:30,177
[music]

1260
01:19:34,331 --> 01:19:36,342
Don't you have any shame?
Aren't you human?

1261
01:19:36,763 --> 01:19:38,449
How can you follow me to this village

1262
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,081
after telling me you would
never show your face?

1263
01:19:40,281 --> 01:19:41,275
That is not the case.
Listen to me Sulochana...

1264
01:19:41,474 --> 01:19:42,955
Do you want to create nuisance here

1265
01:19:43,131 --> 01:19:44,827
because you'll get
thrashed in our village?

1266
01:19:46,387 --> 01:19:47,903
Don't you want to make me
stay decently over here?

1267
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,257
-Sorry Sulochana. I came here before...
-If I see you again,

1268
01:19:51,577 --> 01:19:54,129
I will somehow commit
suicide in this village.

1269
01:19:55,057 --> 01:20:00,991
[music]

1270
01:20:10,669 --> 01:20:12,118
I thought that you would
stay here till the wedding.

1271
01:20:12,742 --> 01:20:15,710
-That's not the reason.
-If you want to come back here,

1272
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:16,652
Come down

1273
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:20,114
Anyway, it was my mistake.
I should face this

1274
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:22,057
Shut that nonsense. Go safe.

1275
01:20:22,374 --> 01:20:23,668
-Alright?
-Damn! Go man.

1276
01:20:24,698 --> 01:20:25,798
Okay. Safe journey.

1277
01:20:28,192 --> 01:20:28,911
Take care dude.

01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:47,766
Get on.

1281
01:20:48,647 --> 01:20:50,069
-What?
-Get on the bike.

1282
01:20:52,025 --> 01:20:52,857
Come on.

1283
01:20:58,236 --> 01:21:00,010
Maintain distance. Don't touch me.

1284
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:06,103
[music]

1285
01:21:17,713 --> 01:21:18,850
I have to tell you something.

1286
01:21:19,813 --> 01:21:20,314
What is it?

1287
01:21:23,464 --> 01:21:24,134
Padma.

1288
01:21:31,073 --> 01:21:34,295
His name is Janardhan.
He followed me many times.

1289
01:21:34,507 --> 01:21:35,765
He didn't stop despite insulting him.

1290
01:21:36,366 --> 01:21:39,543
When I complained about him
to my cousin, he bashed him.

1291
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:43,062
But still, he followed me like a dog
without feeling ashamed or remorse.

1292
01:21:43,403 --> 01:21:44,580
Recently,

1293
01:21:44,803 --> 01:21:46,039
He said he jumped
over the wall in my back yard

1294
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:49,578
and recorded my video when I was bathing.

1295
01:21:52,135 --> 01:21:55,580
He started blackmailing me on
calls since my wedding is fixed

1296
01:21:58,378 --> 01:21:59,735
In order to handover that video to me,

1297
01:22:00,059 --> 01:22:02,164
He asks me to sleep with
him before the wedding...

1298
01:22:02,404 --> 01:22:08,398
[weeping]

1299
01:22:08,614 --> 01:22:09,945
She informed me last night.

1300
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,332
The wedding is in 2 days.

1301
01:22:12,068 --> 01:22:14,772
My brother, Sudheer who bashed
Janaradhan is staying abroad.

1302
01:22:15,438 --> 01:22:17,118
Her wedding would be cancelled if she
informs about this incident to her parents

1303
01:22:17,748 --> 01:22:20,580
She would be humiliated if it is
known to anyone in this village.

1304
01:22:21,694 --> 01:22:23,090
We are outsiders, aren't we?

1305
01:22:25,238 --> 01:22:25,814
What?

1306
01:22:26,427 --> 01:22:29,486
We have to help her
because we are outsiders.

1307
01:22:32,339 --> 01:22:35,543
Leave it to me.
Don't worry.

1308
01:22:35,883 --> 01:22:36,603
Thanks Ramana.

1309
01:22:37,169 --> 01:22:40,079
What is that you have to do with
moron Janardhan instead of going home?

1310
01:22:40,636 --> 01:22:42,012
Did you find out where he lives?

1311
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:45,047
Yeah. Heard that he is boozing near
an abandoned bridge at the outskirts.

1312
01:22:46,313 --> 01:22:47,140
Drive fast.

1313
01:22:47,841 --> 01:22:50,064
What's the matter dude? Any tiff?

1314
01:22:50,663 --> 01:22:53,982
If she doesn't sleep with
me before her wedding,

1315
01:22:54,356 --> 01:22:56,820
I will shave my moustache and
accept that I am a fool.

1316
01:22:58,736 --> 01:23:00,712
-Hi dude.
-Hi

1317
01:23:01,945 --> 01:23:04,314
I was thinking to call you but
you did instead. Come over.

1318
01:23:10,454 --> 01:23:12,275
What's up dude?
Have a seat.

1319
01:23:12,315 --> 01:23:14,974
-Who's he? Is he from our gang?
-He is my friend, Ramana.

1320
01:23:15,473 --> 01:23:16,590
He is a jovial chap.

1321
01:23:18,585 --> 01:23:21,049
-By the way, why did you come?
-Ask him.

1322
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,125
I was betrayed dude.

1323
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:26,101
-Is it love?
-Yeah.

1324
01:23:26,869 --> 01:23:28,194
-Is it?
-Yes dude.

1325
01:23:28,451 --> 01:23:30,094
So you too fall under our category.

1326
01:23:31,592 --> 01:23:32,321
What's you story dude?

1327
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,964
There is a chick in our
village named Padma.

1328
01:23:36,772 --> 01:23:37,387
She is beautiful.

1329
01:23:38,257 --> 01:23:39,884
I proposed her.
She rejected me.

1330
01:23:40,376 --> 01:23:42,950
I asked her to come behind the
buses at least. But she didn't come.

1331
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,982
I was enraged. So I recorded
her video when she was bathing.

1332
01:23:47,765 --> 01:23:48,277
Is it?

1333
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:50,918
He is a dim-wit.

1334
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:52,211
That's the reason I didn't tell you.

1335
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:53,054
Continue your story dude.

1336
01:23:54,586 --> 01:23:55,417
So the next thing I did was,

1337
01:23:55,904 --> 01:24:00,068
I said, "You marry anyone but I should
be the first person to sleep with you"

1338
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:01,284
You are superb dude!

1339
01:24:01,837 --> 01:24:04,801
I've followed her for two
years like a dog, dude!

1340
01:24:05,603 --> 01:24:06,473
Won't she come now?

1341
01:24:07,707 --> 01:24:08,398
I followed my lover for 3 years.

1342
01:24:09,933 --> 01:24:12,068
You have more patience than me dude.

1343
01:24:12,549 --> 01:24:13,843
But I won't give up dude!

1344
01:24:14,677 --> 01:24:17,537
Hello Ramana dude!
Even I'm not giving up.

1345
01:24:18,082 --> 01:24:19,638
If she doesn't turn up to me,

1346
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:22,879
I will post her video to
all the youth in this village.

1347
01:24:23,611 --> 01:24:26,924
Look, he can operate internet.
He will post it on YouTube.

1348
01:24:28,628 --> 01:24:29,473
I'll also have to do the same thing.

1349
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:30,620
Did you too record the video?

1350
01:24:30,897 --> 01:24:31,724
Yeah!

1351
01:24:31,924 --> 01:24:32,453
Is it?

1352
01:24:33,246 --> 01:24:35,863
Yours was in the bathroom whereas
mine was recorded in the bedroom

1353
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:37,206
for 4 consecutive days.

1354
01:24:37,802 --> 01:24:40,550
Dude, please show me.
I'm crazy about such things.

1355
01:24:41,229 --> 01:24:43,033
By the way, which place
does that girl belong to?

1356
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:44,382
This Village.

1357
01:24:45,027 --> 01:24:45,634
Our village?

1358
01:24:46,371 --> 01:24:47,859
Is there any chick who
are not known to us?

1359
01:24:48,482 --> 01:24:49,117
Is she beautiful?

1360
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:50,412
She is mind-blowing.

1361
01:24:50,941 --> 01:24:53,007
She looks hot
when she's wearing clothes!

1362
01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:56,489
Don't tease me dude.
At least, tell her name.

1363
01:24:56,697 --> 01:24:57,352
Geetha.

1364
01:24:58,144 --> 01:25:02,001
-Which Geetha?
-What's that name that starts with D?

1365
01:25:02,553 --> 01:25:03,378
Got it, it is Dhannipudi Geetha.

1366
01:25:04,139 --> 01:25:06,779
-Here, I'm showing you. One, two...
-She is my sister dude.

1367
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:08,711
How dare you to record
the video of my sister!

1368
01:25:08,948 --> 01:25:09,684
Stop it dude.

1369
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:12,555
Isn't your sister a woman or
doesn't she have a body like any woman?

1370
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:13,501
She is my sister idiot!

1371
01:25:13,743 --> 01:25:16,940
Hey, even Padma is someone's
sister and someone's daughter.

1372
01:25:17,185 --> 01:25:18,979
Come on, post it wherever you want.

1373
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:22,707
You humiliate Padma and I will
shame your sister in the entire village.

1374
01:25:22,989 --> 01:25:25,476
If your insanity is a drop,
my insanity is an ocean.

1375
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,333
Are you ready?

1376
01:25:26,965 --> 01:25:30,711
Hey... She is innocent.
Please leave her.

1377
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:31,511
I'm pleading you.

1378
01:25:31,974 --> 01:25:35,322
-Please...
-Take it out.

1379
01:25:36,146 --> 01:25:38,812
-Take it out.
-On it

1380
01:25:39,049 --> 01:25:42,215
-Wait, I'm doing it.
-Do it.

1382
01:25:45,451 --> 01:25:47,186
Please delete my sister's video

1383
01:25:48,251 --> 01:25:48,938
Please leave her dude.

1384
01:25:49,643 --> 01:25:51,057
I don't have anything dude.

1385
01:25:52,601 --> 01:25:53,526
What did you say?

1386
01:25:54,431 --> 01:25:56,598
I don't even know who is
your sister till I was here.

1387
01:25:59,896 --> 01:26:03,039
Hey, whether it is your sister
or someone's, dignity is the same.

1388
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:07,383
We have to tease for
fun but never humiliate.

1389

-Hello
-I'm sorry Padma.

1390
01:26:12,554 --> 01:26:13,365
I've done a grave mistake.

Thanks Ramana.
Thank you so much.

1393

I'm also thankful to you

1394
01:26:29,996 --> 01:26:31,585
because everything got
sorted because of your friend.

01:26:31,797 --> 01:26:32,413
Thank you.

1396
01:26:32,962 --> 01:26:35,948
Your sister called me a friend herself.
But you are like...

1397
01:26:38,446 --> 01:26:38,892
Friends?

1398
01:26:50,268 --> 01:26:51,158
Don't start now!

1399
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:52,469
We are just friends.

1400
01:26:53,025 --> 01:26:56,117
You shouldn't take advantage
and propose me like older times.

1401

I just got to know that
tomorrow is Sulochana's birthday.

01:30:43,885 --> 01:30:46,288
I've been waiting for a
right time to propose her.

01:30:48,111 --> 01:30:49,324
Now, the right time has arrived.

1443

But I don't money to buy a good gift.

1444
01:30:54,271 --> 01:30:56,605
There is no one who would give me a loan.

1445
01:30:56,906 --> 01:30:59,434
I have no scope to even consider
that someone is indebted to me.

1446
01:31:03,237 --> 01:31:04,783
By the way, is there any person
who would give you a loan?

give a loan to you dude?

Hey Suri, this seems like
a register of credits?

1454
01:31:38,733 --> 01:31:40,733
Were you a supplier to general stores?

Where's the money for
the goods that I supplied?

1460
01:32:00,507 --> 01:32:02,790
Do you want to evade the
debt due to his absence?

1461
01:32:02,995 --> 01:32:06,610
Are you playing games? His father
collected the amount recently, didn't he?

Hello, who's speaking?

1475
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:31,091
Hello, I'm Ramana friend of Suri.

1476
01:33:32,045 --> 01:33:34,080
Heard that you need to pay him 8000 bucks.

1477
01:33:35,162 --> 01:33:37,886
Yes, I have to pay him... 8000 bucks.

1478
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:40,643
He gave me the money that he earned
from the supply of commodities.

1479
01:33:40,934 --> 01:33:43,382
I've been to Hyderabad and
earned a job with that money.

1480
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:44,397
After that, I ve been to America.

1481
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:47,572
I came to know about his
death when I was in America.

1482
01:33:48,191 --> 01:33:50,175
It's been a week that I
returned from America.

1483
01:33:51,193 --> 01:33:53,448
I thought to visit his
parents and pay his amount.

1484
01:33:53,785 --> 01:33:55,132
But you called me before that

1485
01:33:55,425 --> 01:33:58,589
I'll transfer the amount if you
send me the account number.

1486
01:34:02,995 --> 01:34:05,259
Hey Suri, thank you very much!

1487
01:34:05,494 --> 01:34:06,657
Is it necessary to meet him?

1488
01:34:07,487 --> 01:34:09,555
He would be disappointed if I
don't meet him on my birthday.

1489
01:34:09,731 --> 01:34:11,251
I've already called him and
informed that I'm on my way.

1490
01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:14,851
Anyhow, why do you give him such space?

1491
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,073
That's the reason the people of
our village are gossiping about you.

1492
01:34:18,203 --> 01:34:19,027
What are they gossiping?

1493
01:34:19,235 --> 01:34:21,620
What would they gossip?
They think both of you as love birds.

1494
01:34:21,816 --> 01:34:23,367
And your cousin, Poorna came to my home

1495
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:26,443
and hatched a plan with my
brother to murder Ramana.

1496
01:34:31,102 --> 01:34:32,990
There is nothing as such.

1497
01:34:33,802 --> 01:34:35,481
I told him at the beginning itself
that we would remain as friends.

1498
01:34:35,621 --> 01:34:36,433
And he too agreed to that.

1499
01:34:38,557 --> 01:34:39,120
That won't be the case.

1500
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:41,392
Ask me if he doesn't propose you now.

1501
01:34:42,276 --> 01:34:42,949
Hell with your guess.

1502
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:49,080
[waves rustling]

1503
01:34:56,059 --> 01:34:56,935
Did you come too?

1504
01:34:56,965 --> 01:35:00,409
Why! Can't you see me?
Oh! I'm a barrier to you?

1505
01:35:00,973 --> 01:35:01,517
Shut up.

1506
01:35:03,518 --> 01:35:05,042
Happy birthday Sulochana.

1507
01:35:05,524 --> 01:35:08,388
Remove your sunglasses.
It's awful to look at.

1508
01:35:08,936 --> 01:35:10,299
Is it looking bad? So be it.

1509
01:35:23,236 --> 01:35:24,166
Why did you present this to me?

1510
01:35:24,931 --> 01:35:25,949
I love you Sulochana.

1511
01:35:28,097 --> 01:35:28,677
-That's how you should treat him.
-Sulochana.

1512
01:35:28,793 --> 01:35:31,186
Disgusting.
She's been trying to explain.

1513
01:35:31,278 --> 01:35:33,198
I was a fool to
consider it as a friendship.

1514
01:35:33,899 --> 01:35:34,882
You wouldn't change ever.

1515
01:35:36,122 --> 01:35:38,226
Not just me, no one changes.

1516
01:35:38,768 --> 01:35:42,752
They try to stay beside her if
they decide her as a soulmate.

1517
01:35:42,976 --> 01:35:44,413
Friends might turn into lovers but

1518
01:35:44,853 --> 01:35:46,678
Lovers cannot turn into
friends, Sulochana.

1519
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:50,293
And if someone says it otherwise,
that can be nothing but nonsense.

1520
01:35:51,038 --> 01:35:52,619
Sulochana, I like you very much.

1521
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:54,842
Every time you board my vehicle,

1522
01:35:54,902 --> 01:35:56,927
I consider myself as a
power star and superstar.

1523
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:01,301
But after you get down from my vehicle,
I felt something pulling down here.

1524
01:36:01,539 --> 01:36:02,963
I too didn't understand what it was.

1525
01:36:03,203 --> 01:36:04,335
But on that day when it was raining...

1526
01:36:06,349 --> 01:36:07,002
Both of us...

1527
01:36:08,789 --> 01:36:10,793
You left that place
thinking that it was a vulgar act.

1528
01:36:12,397 --> 01:36:13,215
But for me...

1529
01:36:15,946 --> 01:36:17,075
I felt that I want to marry you.

1530
01:36:19,382 --> 01:36:21,902
I wanted to be with you in
a romantic way Sulochana.

1531
01:36:22,002 --> 01:36:24,054
If you really love her,
you can do that from a distance too.

1532
01:36:24,345 --> 01:36:26,721
This... This is called nonsense.

1533
01:36:27,591 --> 01:36:30,631
Look Sulochana,
if we are crazy about someone,

1534
01:36:31,134 --> 01:36:32,247
it is not just their heart we wish for,

1535
01:36:33,362 --> 01:36:34,808
we see their physical appearance too.

1536
01:36:36,262 --> 01:36:38,186
Anybody would fall in
love seeking everything.

1537
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:41,148
But not for half baked
dialogues and touching.

1538
01:36:42,706 --> 01:36:43,864
I am super crazy about you.

1539
01:36:44,073 --> 01:36:45,764
That's the reason I've
been following you like a dog

1540
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:47,845
despite having severe debts
and no vehicle to do my job.

1541
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:52,116
Now, if someone sees us and
informs my cousin, he would kill us both.

1542
01:36:56,486 --> 01:36:57,661
What kind of dirt are you into?

1543
01:36:58,981 --> 01:37:00,152
What's his position and what's yours?

1544
01:37:01,811 --> 01:37:02,797
You look like an angel.

would come with you leaving my parents?

1720
01:53:09,421 --> 01:53:13,943
Look, it is better to lose
you than lose my parents.

1721
01:53:16,241 --> 01:53:17,456
Ramana, just go away from here.

1722
01:53:18,676 --> 01:53:19,497
I can't come with you.

1723
01:53:20,493 --> 01:53:25,108
If at all if I come with you,
my parents will die at my wedding venue.

1724
01:53:27,462 --> 01:53:29,199
I can't get them into such situation.

1725
01:53:30,233 --> 01:53:31,928
I can't do this any more. Not possible.

1726
01:53:33,028 --> 01:53:36,640
If you follow me again, I'll kill myself
before my parents take that extreme step.

1727
01:53:36,997 --> 01:53:42,983
[music]

1728
01:53:52,815 --> 01:53:54,247
We are fools.

1729
01:53:56,767 --> 01:53:59,129
If we fall in love, we'll be left
with nothing but her memories.

1730
01:54:01,065 --> 01:54:03,471
From the moment we get up in the morning,
we'll think whether she woke up or not,

1731
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:06,826
what's she doing, what dress she wore,

1732
01:54:06,998 --> 01:54:08,375
Did she eat?

1733
01:54:10,059 --> 01:54:13,261
We want to talk to her, see her,
be with her,

1734
01:54:13,436 --> 01:54:15,403
roam with her everywhere and what not.

1735
01:54:17,822 --> 01:54:19,475
We'll just waste our time.

1736
01:54:23,298 --> 01:54:24,865
But in the end, what did she do?

1737
01:54:28,311 --> 01:54:32,094
Her wedding got fixed with her cousin.

1738
01:54:42,578 --> 01:54:44,003
I don't mind if she scolds me.

1739
01:54:46,519 --> 01:54:48,873
I don't mind if she hits
me because she is mine.

1740
01:54:53,540 --> 01:54:55,236
Why's she getting married?

1741
01:54:56,323 --> 01:54:58,339
I'm feeling unexplained pain dude.

1742
01:55:01,045 --> 01:55:02,549
I feel like dying.

1743
01:55:03,172 --> 01:55:03,592
[knock]

1744
01:55:04,194 --> 01:55:06,632
No dude, I'll die.

1745
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:07,370
[knock]

1746
01:55:07,455 --> 01:55:08,951
I can't live without her.

1747
01:55:09,676 --> 01:55:10,387
I'll die.

1748
01:55:10,511 --> 01:55:10,964
[knock]

1749
01:55:11,064 --> 01:55:12,471
Hey, stop dude!

1750
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:17,274
This pain can go unless I die.

1751
01:55:17,929 --> 01:55:20,929
She said that her parents
would die if she goes with me.

1752
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:24,122
Shouldn't she know that I
can't live without her?

1753
01:55:24,618 --> 01:55:27,426
I'll take better care
of her than her parents.

1754
01:55:28,542 --> 01:55:30,565
Don't I have love for her?

1755
01:55:31,778 --> 01:55:37,470
[sobbing]

1756
01:55:41,324 --> 01:55:43,184
I'll die dude.

[music]

1760
01:56:40,918 --> 01:56:41,794
I'll die.

1761
01:56:42,094 --> 01:56:42,570
[knock ]

1762
01:56:43,809 --> 01:56:44,818
I'll die.

1763
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:45,874

1766
01:56:50,878 --> 01:56:51,565
What's that sound?

1767
01:56:57,202 --> 01:56:59,049
[knocking]
Ramana

1768
01:56:59,549 --> 01:57:01,715
Ramana
[knocking]

1769
01:57:03,035 --> 01:57:03,458
Hey...

1770
01:57:05,461 --> 01:57:06,068
What happened?

1771
01:57:07,523 --> 01:57:08,223
What's that sound?

1772
01:57:08,856 --> 01:57:09,464
Nothing mom.

1773
01:57:10,643 --> 01:57:14,127
I don't get this Ramana.
People are gossiping about you

1774
01:57:14,376 --> 01:57:16,829
that you were roaming with
a girl from a wealthy family

1775
01:57:17,021 --> 01:57:18,762
and they have even thrashed you.

1776
01:57:19,054 --> 01:57:19,484
Is it true?

1777
01:57:19,948 --> 01:57:22,588
If it is true, he would beg
with broken arms or limbs.

1778
01:57:22,845 --> 01:57:25,162
If it is not, he would live
a carefree life with no work.

1779
01:57:25,274 --> 01:57:26,894
What difference does it make to us or him?

1780
01:57:26,994 --> 01:57:28,318
Don't bother about your father's words.

1781
01:57:28,939 --> 01:57:31,323
Anyhow, why do we need to
have a tiff with wealthy people?

1782
01:57:31,467 --> 01:57:35,491
Alright, take this money and
give it at Aunt Susheela's home.

1783
01:57:35,631 --> 01:57:36,795
They are going to Kasi.

1784
01:57:37,634 --> 01:57:38,410
Why are they going to Kasi?

1785
01:57:38,958 --> 01:57:40,787
They had a death of an
elderly person in their home.

1786
01:57:40,795 --> 01:57:43,837
It was his wish to
visit Kasi before his death.

1787
01:57:43,839 --> 01:57:45,432
Meanwhile, he became bedridden.

1788
01:57:45,911 --> 01:57:48,951
So he asked them to immerse
his ashes in Kashi at least.

1789
01:57:49,169 --> 01:57:50,558
If we don't fulfil such wishes,

1790
01:57:50,782 --> 01:57:53,102
it seems that their souls
would be roaming around us.

1791
01:57:53,461 --> 01:57:54,081
Souls?

1792
01:57:54,181 --> 01:57:55,549
Yes, souls.

1793
01:57:55,718 --> 01:57:57,260
If the old man's wishes get fulfilled,

1794
01:57:57,568 --> 01:57:59,809
Then his soul would attain peace
and rest happily in heaven.

1795
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:03,490
What is meant by soul attaining peace?

1796
01:58:03,797 --> 01:58:05,847
I don't know. But the elders say so.

1797
01:58:06,255 --> 01:58:06,932
Who are those elders?

1798
01:58:07,216 --> 01:58:10,269
Here, start now. They're getting delayed.

1799
01:58:10,477 --> 01:58:14,133
Well, you dad is getting angry.
Go and give it at their home quickly.

1800
01:58:14,306 --> 01:58:15,280
But mom, who are those elders?

1801
01:58:15,506 --> 01:58:18,071
How would I know? Ask Brahmins.

1802
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:24,559
A human lives with a lot
of desires when he's alive.

1803
01:58:24,884 --> 01:58:26,251
If they die unexpectedly,

1804
01:58:26,674 --> 01:58:32,268
Their souls would roam around us till
their wishes get fulfilled says science.

1805
01:58:34,558 --> 01:58:38,035
-In fact...
-Enough sir. Thank you sir.

1806
01:58:38,327 --> 01:58:38,832
Hey listen...

1807
01:58:45,236 --> 01:58:46,584
Hey Suri, are you around?

1808
01:58:46,708 --> 01:58:47,220
[knock knock]

1809
01:58:47,986 --> 01:58:49,458
I just met a priest.

1810
01:58:51,761 --> 01:58:54,662
He said that people who die with their
wishes unfulfilled would become spirits.

1811
01:58:55,550 --> 01:58:57,138
Do you have any unfulfilled wishes too?

1812
01:59:00,184 --> 01:59:03,179
It's you I'm asking.
Do you have any such wishes?

1813
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:05,098
[knock knock]

1814
01:59:05,909 --> 01:59:07,719
Why do you take time to reply?

1815
01:59:08,135 --> 01:59:08,803
Are they big wishes?

1816
01:59:09,276 --> 01:59:09,698
[knock]

1817
01:59:11,467 --> 01:59:15,407
Oh! Is it a small wish?
Is it the reason you are here?

1818
01:59:15,638 --> 01:59:16,263
[knock knock]

1819
01:59:16,971 --> 01:59:20,489
Don't worry. I'll fulfil your
wishes. You did a lot to me.

1820
01:59:22,895 --> 01:59:23,987
I too should help you.

1821
01:59:26,431 --> 01:59:27,903
What are your wishes? Tell me.

1822
01:59:30,887 --> 01:59:32,328
What wishes would you have before death?

1823
01:59:41,771 --> 01:59:43,683
What if I ask who are
in the verge of dying?

1824
01:59:45,511 --> 01:59:46,343
Then I would know them.

1825
01:59:48,611 --> 01:59:50,382
I never had a
comfortable life after marriage.

1826
01:59:51,151 --> 01:59:53,348
You used to intoxicate all the times.

1827
01:59:53,722 --> 01:59:55,892
Now, his intoxication
habit is killing him.

1828
01:59:57,159 --> 01:59:59,518
Hey oldie, do you have any last wishes?

1829
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:02,700
[gasping]

1830
02:00:04,589 --> 02:00:07,653
I want to have a qu... quarter of alcohol.

1831
02:00:10,832 --> 02:00:13,350
To hell with you and your quarter!

1832
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:20,935
Why did you attempt suicide?

1833
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:24,064
My parents always scolded me to study.

1834
02:00:24,413 --> 02:00:26,488
Even my college wanted me to get a rank...

1835
02:00:26,676 --> 02:00:29,673
...for their fame and I
was fully pressurised.

1836
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:33,904
Unable to withstand pressure
and study as per their expectations,

1837
02:00:34,372 --> 02:00:36,652
I took sleeping pills to kill myself.

1838
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:39,322
Do you have any final wishes?

1839
02:00:42,716 --> 02:00:44,060
My son...

1840
02:00:44,684 --> 02:00:46,942
My dear son, this is a heartbreaking step!

1841
02:00:46,985 --> 02:00:52,166
You are our only son.
How did you even think to abandon us?

1842
02:00:52,785 --> 02:00:55,759
Forgive me mom. Forgive me dad.

1843
02:00:55,922 --> 02:00:59,885
-What have done to you?
-I'll never do this again.

1844
02:01:00,461 --> 02:01:01,756
Please forgive me.

1845
02:01:09,804 --> 02:01:13,832
I've visited all the persons who are on
the verge of death to know your last wish.

1846
02:01:16,189 --> 02:01:17,051
But there was no use.

1847
02:01:18,661 --> 02:01:21,620
I've visited different persons
such as old man, drunkard etc.

1848
02:01:21,962 --> 02:01:25,850
I've visited a college goer who was
saved after his failed suicide attempt.

1849
02:01:26,594 --> 02:01:30,296
But he was crying and asking for
forgiveness when his parents came.

1850
02:01:35,891 --> 02:01:36,681
Forgive me dude.

1851
02:01:38,536 --> 02:01:41,233
I didn't know your last wish.

1852
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:44,139
Sorry dude
[knock knock]

1853
02:01:47,268 --> 02:01:49,865
Do you want me not to apologise to you?

1854

[knock]

1855
02:01:52,471 --> 02:01:54,085
Or do you want to apologise?

1856
02:01:55,055 --> 02:01:56,650
Then try saying it.

1857
02:01:57,314 --> 02:01:57,946
[knock knock]

1858
02:01:59,242 --> 02:02:04,904
What? Do you want to apologise to

[knock knock]

1860
02:02:09,875 --> 02:02:12,593
Hey, whom do you want to apologise to?
"Radio playing Maatru Devo Bhava song"

1861
02:02:15,423 --> 02:02:18,504
Hey... Do you really want
to apologise to anyone?

1862
02:02:19,134 --> 02:02:19,773
[knock knock]

1863
02:02:20,054 --> 02:02:21,774
I'm hearing 'Maatru Devo
Bhava, Pitru Devo Bhava'.

1864
02:02:23,338 --> 02:02:24,934
It means respect mother and father.

1865
02:02:25,989 --> 02:02:27,030
Do you want apologise to them Suri?

1866
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:28,464
[knock knock]

1867
02:02:28,664 --> 02:02:29,852
Is it just them or do
you have anyone else?

1868
02:02:30,385 --> 02:02:31,275
Just as the lyrics of that song,

1869
02:02:32,011 --> 02:02:35,450
'Maatru Devo Bhava, Pitru Devo Bhava
Acharya Devo Bhava Atithi Devo...'

1870
02:02:37,382 --> 02:02:38,374
'Acharya Devo Bhava'

[knock knock]

1872
02:02:40,730 --> 02:02:41,425
It means respect teacher.

1873
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:43,140
Is it just one person?

1874
02:02:43,768 --> 02:02:44,409
[knock knock]

1875
02:02:48,388 --> 02:02:53,141
Similarly, 'Atithi Devo Bhava'

1876
02:02:53,982 --> 02:02:55,537
It means respect realtives.

1877
02:02:56,370 --> 02:02:57,957
Who would be related to us at this age?

1878
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:02,152
Is it a friend?

1879
02:03:02,404 --> 02:03:03,102
[knock knock]

1880
02:03:03,348 --> 02:03:04,971
Thank God! Are you done with the list?

1881
02:03:05,531 --> 02:03:06,128
[knock]

1882
02:03:06,773 --> 02:03:07,665
Who else are left, you idiot?

1883
02:03:08,397 --> 02:03:09,613
Just that I'm helping,
you're playing with me.

1884
02:03:14,855 --> 02:03:17,644
Fine! Don't whine about it.

1885
02:03:18,311 --> 02:03:21,339
You're making me plead
you as if you're my lover.

1886
02:03:21,927 --> 02:03:22,754
[knock knock]

1887
02:03:30,228 --> 02:03:30,893
Is it your lover you're referring to?

1888
02:03:31,517 --> 02:03:32,305
[knock knock]

1889
02:03:35,875 --> 02:03:39,175
So you want me to go to
your teacher, parents,

1890
02:03:39,563 --> 02:03:42,427
friend and lover and
apologise to them on your behalf?

1891
02:03:43,066 --> 02:03:43,717
[knock knock]

1892
02:03:44,084 --> 02:03:44,665
Okay.

1893
02:03:46,246 --> 02:03:48,262
By the way, why you
need to apologise to them?

1894
02:03:51,571 --> 02:03:52,513
Do you have any loans?

1895
02:03:52,751 --> 02:03:53,200
[knock]

1896
02:03:54,937 --> 02:03:56,093
Or did you do any mistake?

1897
02:03:56,267 --> 02:03:56,778
[knock knock]

1898
02:03:58,676 --> 02:04:01,740
I didn't find any mistakes
in your story till your death.

1899
02:04:05,223 --> 02:04:06,154
By any chance,

1900
02:04:07,178 --> 02:04:11,403
do you consider your suicide bid as a
mistake just like that student?

1901
02:04:11,740 --> 02:04:12,564
[knock knock]

1902
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:15,220
What's the mistake in that?

1903
02:04:16,031 --> 02:04:18,623
Your love failed,
so you committed suicide.

1904
02:04:19,916 --> 02:04:22,048
I too fell in love, but it failed.

1905
02:04:22,915 --> 02:04:25,384
I'm committing suicide too.
What's the mistake in that?

1906
02:04:27,594 --> 02:04:28,329
Is it a mistake?

1907
02:04:28,853 --> 02:04:29,606
[knock knock]

1908
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:34,019
It might be a mistake for you,
but not for me.

1909
02:04:34,627 --> 02:04:36,592
You would think that you've
showered great love on your lover.

1910
02:04:37,096 --> 02:04:38,992
But I loved my
Sulochana more than you did.

1911
02:04:40,002 --> 02:04:43,382
That's the reason I don't want to live.

1912
02:04:44,146 --> 02:04:45,300
Dying is the right thing.

1913
02:04:49,417 --> 02:04:50,619
Before I commit suicide,

1914
02:04:51,962 --> 02:04:53,517
which means before Sulochana's wedding,

1915
02:04:54,499 --> 02:04:57,451
It's my responsibility
to fulfil all your wishes.

1916
02:04:59,658 --> 02:05:00,130
[dialing]

1917
02:05:02,171 --> 02:05:05,195
The number you are trying
is currently not reachable

1918
02:05:05,559 --> 02:05:08,484
To leave a voice SMS,
just dial 'star' followed by...

1919
02:05:09,029 --> 02:05:11,301
The phone isn't connecting when I'm
trying to call your friend, Pramod.

1920
02:05:12,839 --> 02:05:14,183
I don't know where they live.

1921
02:05:16,067 --> 02:05:16,642
Fine,

1922
02:05:17,108 --> 02:05:19,779
Meanwhile, I'll visit my
auto-rickshaw gang for one last time

1923
02:05:20,543 --> 02:05:22,445
and tell that I'm leaving this village.

1924
02:05:24,102 --> 02:05:27,481
Because, they don't know that I'm
committing suicide, don't they?

1925
02:05:30,451 --> 02:05:34,280
Hey guys! I told you on the day of his
entry in our village that he is a big fool

1926
02:05:34,726 --> 02:05:35,625
No one believed me.

1927
02:05:36,172 --> 02:05:37,307
What trouble is he bringing this time?

1928
02:05:40,103 --> 02:05:40,794
He is here, look at him.

1929
02:05:44,908 --> 02:05:45,621
I'm leaving.

1930
02:05:46,949 --> 02:05:49,918
I can't stay here after all these ruckus.

1931
02:05:51,354 --> 02:05:55,023
Hey, please forgive me if I've
done any mistake unknowingly.

1932
02:05:57,165 --> 02:06:00,493
You are a good person.
But control your jealousy and foolishness.

1933
02:06:03,969 --> 02:06:08,017
Hey Srinu, don't just
blindly follow people,

1934
02:06:09,138 --> 02:06:10,730
Even you are intelligent.
Channelise it the right way.

1935
02:06:12,765 --> 02:06:15,937
Forgive me if I've hurt you too.

1936
02:06:19,568 --> 02:06:23,406
Uncle, if you have a son as of my age,

1937
02:06:23,838 --> 02:06:25,197
You wouldn't have had these hardships.

1938
02:06:27,044 --> 02:06:30,502
When you're making efforts
to survive your daughters at this age,

1939
02:06:31,887 --> 02:06:33,339
I wanted to help you in
some or the other way.

1940
02:06:36,935 --> 02:06:39,967
Take my first position Uncle.

1941
02:06:41,755 --> 02:06:44,122
Work till your energy lasts
and get them a good education.

1942
02:06:44,846 --> 02:06:45,390
Okay?

1943
02:06:48,733 --> 02:06:49,390
I'll leave.

1944
02:06:51,384 --> 02:06:53,488
-Hey Ramana, what happened?
-Ramana...

1945
02:06:54,149 --> 02:06:57,071
-Ramana... Hey...
-What happened to him?

1946
02:07:00,275 --> 02:07:01,099
[dialing]

1947
02:07:01,423 --> 02:07:03,248
[phone ringing]

1948
02:07:04,175 --> 02:07:04,587
Hello.

1949
02:07:04,807 --> 02:07:07,870
Ramana held a meeting with the other
auto-rickshaw drivers at the centre.

1950
02:07:08,072 --> 02:07:08,882
What meeting?

1951
02:07:09,214 --> 02:07:11,278
He should have definitely
hatched a plan for Sulochana.

1952
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:14,158
-For Sulcohana?
-I suspect the same thing.

1953
02:07:14,506 --> 02:07:16,874
Forget suspicion. We should bash him.

1954
02:07:17,263 --> 02:07:19,106
Even he shouldn't know
that we've done that.

1955
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:25,120
Brother what's up?
Heard that you came to my home?

1956
02:07:25,331 --> 02:07:28,484
The fisherman gave 50 bucks
for a ride. Do you want it?

1957
02:07:33,713 --> 02:07:35,381
I couldn't do anything for you.

1958
02:07:35,503 --> 02:07:38,191
Or shall I get a cigarette
for you, brother.

1959
02:07:38,399 --> 02:07:44,335
[music]

1960
02:07:53,845 --> 02:07:54,282
No dude.

1961
02:07:56,904 --> 02:07:57,664
Stay safe.

1962
02:07:59,548 --> 02:08:00,387
What happened brother?

1963
02:08:04,308 --> 02:08:04,883
I'm leaving.

1964
02:08:06,650 --> 02:08:07,271
Do you have any work?

1965
02:08:20,853 --> 02:08:26,802
[fighting sounds]

1966
02:08:38,901 --> 02:08:40,704
-I can't find brother.
-They might have killed him.

1967
02:08:40,744 --> 02:08:44,908
A minute before Poorna
ties knot to Sulochana...

1968
02:08:45,775 --> 02:08:47,251
I decided to commit suicide.

1969
02:08:48,472 --> 02:08:50,163
As per my promise to Suri,

1970
02:08:50,303 --> 02:08:54,954
I'll have to meet his teacher,
parents, friend and lover.

1971
02:08:55,653 --> 02:08:57,557
He is a fool who doesn't
know the way of living.

1972
02:08:57,688 --> 02:08:59,911
He is an idiot betrayed my
trust for the sake of love.

1973
02:09:00,146 --> 02:09:01,819
I won't forgive him.
I can't do that.

1974
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:03,081
I won't forgive him.

1975
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,284
If I did that, I'll forget that fool.

1976
02:09:05,584 --> 02:09:06,639
I don't want that to happen.

1977
02:09:07,034 --> 02:09:08,314
Where are Suri's parents?

1978
02:09:15,186 --> 02:09:16,442
My love story is done.

1979
02:09:16,942 --> 02:09:18,310
I'm left with my responsibility.

1980
02:09:19,003 --> 02:09:20,963
That's nothing but my word to Suri.

1981
02:09:23,101 --> 02:09:25,821
That's the house...
where Suri's parents reside.

1982
02:09:28,504 --> 02:09:29,132
Won't you come?

1983
02:09:29,308 --> 02:09:31,484
No, they would remember his
memories when they see me.

1984
02:09:31,784 --> 02:09:33,727
You meet them. When you're done,
call me. I'll stay at the centre.

1985
02:09:46,344 --> 02:09:46,813
Hello sir.

1986
02:09:48,107 --> 02:09:49,835
I'm Ramana, Suri's friend.

1987
02:09:52,463 --> 02:09:54,515
You are Suresh's father, right?

1988
02:09:56,023 --> 02:09:57,071
What do you want?

1989
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:58,663
I'm sorry.

1990
02:09:59,391 --> 02:10:00,911
Before Suri took the extreme step,

1991
02:10:01,319 --> 02:10:03,411
he asked me meet and
apologise to you on his behalf.

1992
02:10:06,366 --> 02:10:08,122
So you're done with the apology,
right? Now, get going.

1993
02:10:08,298 --> 02:10:10,390
Did Suri come back?

1994
02:10:11,685 --> 02:10:15,679
-Is she Suri's mother?
-No, just go away from here.

1995
02:10:16,161 --> 02:10:16,713
Just go.

1996
02:10:17,031 --> 02:10:17,865
My dear Suri...

1997
02:10:18,264 --> 02:10:18,945
She's calling sir.

1998
02:10:19,787 --> 02:10:21,043
She's not calling you. Just go.

1999
02:10:21,155 --> 02:10:22,595
-Suri...
-Why is she calling Suri?

2000
02:10:22,815 --> 02:10:24,027
Hey, I told you she is not calling, right?

2001
02:10:24,103 --> 02:10:25,997
-Suri
-Hey, wait...

2002
02:10:26,392 --> 02:10:31,908
My dear Suri...
How are you?

2003
02:10:32,748 --> 02:10:34,071
Why aren't you coming home?

2004
02:10:35,442 --> 02:10:36,482
Did your dad scold you?

2005
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:42,382
Did you eat food?

2006
02:10:42,859 --> 02:10:44,155
Shall I prepare Dal and eggplant curry?

2007
02:10:47,563 --> 02:10:49,563
Hey, our Suri came. Did you greet him?

2008
02:10:50,321 --> 02:10:51,588
[weeping]

2009
02:10:51,756 --> 02:10:53,215
Why do you stare like a mad person?

2010
02:10:55,395 --> 02:10:56,495
Our Suri is back.

2011
02:10:59,557 --> 02:11:00,416
Give me a moment.

2012
02:11:05,897 --> 02:11:08,494
Keep this in your pocket.
Buy some food at your college.

2013
02:11:09,270 --> 02:11:10,199
Don't tell your father.

2014
02:11:13,186 --> 02:11:16,160
Study well. You have to take
good care of your mother.

2015
02:11:18,738 --> 02:11:21,822
My dear son, I'm having severe
health issues these days.

2016
02:11:24,135 --> 02:11:25,484
You won't leave me, right?

2017
02:11:25,932 --> 02:11:26,916
Now, say your apologies to her!

2018
02:11:29,150 --> 02:11:30,038
Do you want me to forgive?

2019
02:11:32,363 --> 02:11:35,359
They say children would fly
away after they develop wings.

2020
02:11:36,043 --> 02:11:40,209
But our Suri...
he just broke our wings and went away.

2021
02:11:40,385 --> 02:11:41,206
He just left us.

2022
02:11:41,788 --> 02:11:45,872
[weeping]

2023
02:11:47,516 --> 02:11:48,385
Will you come back?

2024
02:11:50,219 --> 02:11:51,271
Yes, he would come.

2025
02:11:56,152 --> 02:11:59,288
[phone ringing]

2026
02:12:02,925 --> 02:12:08,862
[music]

2027
02:12:23,381 --> 02:12:28,833
[machine beeping]

2028
02:12:30,511 --> 02:12:33,561
-Mom
-Ramana

2029
02:12:38,362 --> 02:12:40,474
Don't cry. I'm fine.

2030
02:12:43,401 --> 02:12:44,934
I was good in the morning.

2031
02:12:46,044 --> 02:12:49,093
They said that I was
collapsed after I got a seizure.

2032
02:12:51,329 --> 02:12:54,866
Your dad took me to the hospital when
he saw froth leaking from my mouth.

2033
02:12:55,885 --> 02:12:59,294
Look, I bit my tongue. That's it.

2034
02:13:00,348 --> 02:13:01,232
What happened mom?

2035
02:13:01,986 --> 02:13:02,918
It's just nothing.

2036
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:06,388
They said that it would take

2037
02:13:09,328 --> 02:13:11,169
five lakh rupees to save your mom's life.

2038
02:13:14,228 --> 02:13:16,068
We can't afford that amount.

2039
02:13:17,556 --> 02:13:20,980
Hey... I'm not worried
about losing my life.

2040
02:13:27,273 --> 02:13:28,889
Your dad is a dumbo.

2041
02:13:31,058 --> 02:13:32,642
And you are a stubborn person.

2042
02:13:33,955 --> 02:13:38,288
I'm worried about how you
would survive after my death.

2043
02:13:40,495 --> 02:13:42,279
He's been roaming around
the hospital like a madman

2044
02:13:44,244 --> 02:13:46,995
worrying that I might die.

2045
02:13:49,659 --> 02:13:52,828
Please go and check
where your father is my dear son.

2046
02:13:56,499 --> 02:13:57,902
Ramana, please do that for me.

2047
02:14:07,498 --> 02:14:08,886
Sir, where did my father go?
I saw him sitting here some time ago.

2048
02:14:08,946 --> 02:14:10,614
He went to meet Auto
Raju for money, Ramana.

2049
02:14:13,771 --> 02:14:14,553
It is 5 lakh rupees.

2050
02:14:14,745 --> 02:14:15,667
Thanks for having trust in me

2051
02:14:15,791 --> 02:14:17,535
and giving that amount despite you
don't lease your vehicle to my son.

2052
02:14:17,839 --> 02:14:19,983
I don't believe in trust
and other related things.

2053
02:14:20,037 --> 02:14:21,565
That's the reason
I'm giving you this amount.

2054
02:14:22,199 --> 02:14:23,805
Sign those papers and take that amount.

2055
02:14:25,780 --> 02:14:26,772
What did you write in those?

2056
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:32,310
I wrote, your son Ramana would work
under me for 10 years without a payment.

2057
02:14:32,570 --> 02:14:35,099
It is unfair to pawn my son's future sir.

2058
02:14:35,391 --> 02:14:37,260
Anyway, you don't any faith in him.

2059
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:38,933
He would at least learn the
skill if he works under me.

2060
02:14:38,993 --> 02:14:40,190
What will you teach him?

2061
02:14:42,502 --> 02:14:45,495
What's the need to get these costly
diseases despite having no money for food?

2062
02:14:45,785 --> 02:14:47,593
Why should you have pride
for giving birth to such fool?

2063
02:14:47,815 --> 02:14:49,211
Raju, mind your tongue.

2064
02:14:49,671 --> 02:14:51,255
You and I know that he's got skills.

2065
02:14:51,788 --> 02:14:54,444
You are not a fool to invest this huge
amount on him if he's not having skill.

2066
02:14:55,839 --> 02:14:56,513
He is a golden boy.

2067
02:14:57,376 --> 02:14:59,955
He might be irresponsible
due to his young age factor,

2068
02:15:00,399 --> 02:15:01,873
But if takes stand and
work hard for few years,

2069
02:15:02,073 --> 02:15:03,663
He can make four people
like you work under him.

2070
02:15:04,607 --> 02:15:07,344
It's my ill-fate that I
came to you for money.

2071
02:15:09,143 --> 02:15:12,677
I don't mind if his
mother couldn't be saved or me.

2072
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:16,674
We don't have any right
to pawn his future.

2073
02:15:29,512 --> 02:15:35,432
[music]
[weeping]

2074
02:15:47,382 --> 02:15:48,256
Hey Suri!

2075
02:15:48,648 --> 02:15:49,216
[knock knock]

2076
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:52,448
Do you what my dad spoke about me?

2077
02:15:52,869 --> 02:15:57,113
He said that there can be no
match for me if I work hard.

2078
02:15:59,549 --> 02:16:02,009
I need 5 lakh rupees to save my mother.

2079
02:16:04,060 --> 02:16:07,229
Where is the money if I'm very great?

2080
02:16:10,175 --> 02:16:13,027
My dad is a madman as my mom said.

2081
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:19,700
I'm a foolish son to them.

2082
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:34,360
Hey Suri, I met your Guru.

2083
02:16:38,335 --> 02:16:39,385
He said he won't forgive you.

2084
02:16:41,392 --> 02:16:44,200
I thought he won't understand the
meaning of love as he is an old man.

2085
02:16:46,081 --> 02:16:47,553
I even met your friend.

2086
02:16:49,847 --> 02:16:50,975
He said the same thing.

2087
02:16:53,076 --> 02:16:55,620
I thought he is too
foolish to understand your love.

2088
02:16:58,361 --> 02:16:58,964
But...

2089
02:17:03,943 --> 02:17:06,082
When I met your parents...

2090
02:17:09,685 --> 02:17:11,701
I felt for the first time that

2091
02:17:12,836 --> 02:17:15,057
You made a grave
mistake by committing suicide.

2092
02:17:32,791 --> 02:17:33,413
Hey Suri...

2093
02:17:35,793 --> 02:17:40,357
I have to apologise to you as how you
asked me to apologise to your people.

2094
02:17:42,618 --> 02:17:44,166
You've asked me to meet everyone,

2095
02:17:45,908 --> 02:17:48,100
But I couldn't meet your lover.

2096
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:51,136
Please forgive me.

2097
02:17:53,554 --> 02:17:57,443
Can anyone live up to
face the death of his mother.

2098
02:18:00,963 --> 02:18:02,855
Adding to my woes,
I have to lose Sulochana.

2099
02:18:03,550 --> 02:18:05,224
I loved her and she's
getting married to another guy.

2100
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:15,055
The thought about Sulochana getting
married to Poorna itself is devastating.

2101
02:18:19,237 --> 02:18:22,486
Instead of living a life where I have to
watch that and do nothing about it,

2102
02:18:23,938 --> 02:18:25,192
It is better to die.

2103
02:18:26,712 --> 02:18:28,196
It is better to die.

2104
02:18:28,787 --> 02:18:34,739
[woman weeping]

2105
02:18:42,671 --> 02:18:44,311
Hey, who are you?

2106
02:18:44,957 --> 02:18:46,683
I'm asking you. Who are you?

2107
02:19:03,783 --> 02:19:06,514
She is my daugter, Fareedha.

2108
02:19:10,633 --> 02:19:12,617
A person named Suri
used to live in this house.

2109
02:19:13,710 --> 02:19:15,502
He and my daughter loved each other.

2110
02:19:18,111 --> 02:19:23,235
Both of them consumed acid as
we didn't accept their love.

2111
02:19:28,728 --> 02:19:31,234
Suri died peacefully.

2112
02:19:34,430 --> 02:19:37,626
But she dangled between life and death,

2113
02:19:40,539 --> 02:19:43,306
and got discharged from
the hospital recently.

2114
02:19:46,565 --> 02:19:49,799
As she is our only daughter
and her life got devastated,

2115
02:19:51,121 --> 02:19:52,689
Her father became bed-ridden.

2116
02:19:54,244 --> 02:19:58,053
My family is completely devastated!

2117
02:19:58,337 --> 02:20:00,165
Completely devastated!

2118
02:20:00,673 --> 02:20:03,570
He died two years ago on this very day.

2119
02:20:07,292 --> 02:20:10,107
She asked me to bring her
here for one last time, so I did.

2120
02:20:12,516 --> 02:20:16,901
I thought that she would cry
off her pain and forget about it.

2121
02:20:17,785 --> 02:20:20,597
But I don't understand
what's about this love?

2122
02:20:23,263 --> 02:20:25,888
Does love devastate these many lives?

2123
02:20:28,569 --> 02:20:33,012
The girl who is treated with utmost
love and affection since her birth,

2124
02:20:33,813 --> 02:20:39,105
is made to fall in love with guys
like you by following her for a few days.

2125
02:20:40,617 --> 02:20:42,867
In order to raise them,

2126
02:20:44,192 --> 02:20:48,388
Do we turn our blood into sweat and
raise them up with utmost care.

2127
02:20:49,391 --> 02:20:51,611
so that guys like
you can take them away from us?

2128
02:20:53,969 --> 02:20:58,175
If we didn't accept your love and
make our daughters listen to us,

2129
02:20:58,995 --> 02:21:02,063
You would either kill
her or kill yourselves.

2130
02:21:04,326 --> 02:21:08,878
Don't we know whom we
should get her married to?

2131
02:21:13,213 --> 02:21:15,893
A lot of people are in
pain due to just one guy.

2132
02:21:18,664 --> 02:21:23,672
Everyone around him including his
family and our family are suffering.

2133
02:21:24,682 --> 02:21:25,706
Is this a solution?

2134
02:21:34,655 --> 02:21:37,727
I just understood that,

2135
02:21:39,344 --> 02:21:43,255
a lot of lives would be devastated

2136
02:21:45,143 --> 02:21:46,471
if a person commits suicide.

2137
02:21:47,796 --> 02:21:50,696
When I asked you if you had
any last wishes on that day,

2138
02:21:54,053 --> 02:21:55,957
You thought for a while and answered it.

2139
02:22:01,042 --> 02:22:06,315
I understood today that
it was meant to save me.

2140
02:22:11,793 --> 02:22:16,076
I understood that it is a grave mistake

2141
02:22:17,163 --> 02:22:18,731
to kill someone or oneself for love.

2142
02:22:21,427 --> 02:22:23,668
Damn! Let her go away!

2143
02:22:24,244 --> 02:22:24,987
Let her go away!

2144
02:22:25,399 --> 02:22:28,115
It doesn't matter if
she is with me or not.

2145
02:22:37,481 --> 02:22:38,179
Hey...

2146
02:22:40,297 --> 02:22:46,027
I have my mother, father,

2147
02:22:47,623 --> 02:22:52,455
friends and many
people around me to love me.

2148
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:56,412
I don't want her anymore.

2149
02:22:57,493 --> 02:23:00,405
However, what more do I want
when I have a friend like you?

2150
02:23:02,767 --> 02:23:05,895
Hey Suri, are you with me?

2151
02:23:09,452 --> 02:23:13,253
Hey Suri... are you with me?

2152
02:23:15,973 --> 02:23:17,414
Hey Suri...

2153
02:23:19,202 --> 02:23:19,928
Are you with me?

2154
02:23:22,042 --> 02:23:23,023
Hey Suri

2155
02:23:25,134 --> 02:23:26,262
Are you with me?

2156
02:23:27,327 --> 02:23:28,112
Hey Suri...

2157
02:23:30,328 --> 02:23:31,544
Hey Suri...

2158
02:23:33,666 --> 02:23:35,795
Hey Suri!

2159
02:23:38,145 --> 02:23:39,618
FROM BIRTH TILL DEATH,

2160
02:23:39,826 --> 02:23:45,687
PARENTS, SIBLINGS, RELATIVES, FRIENDS,
WORLD, NATURE, COURSE AND DESTINATION

2161
02:23:45,946 --> 02:23:50,170
WILL INTERTWINE AND FLOW WITH
ENDLESS LOVE. THAT IS CALLED LIFE.

2162
02:23:50,779 --> 02:23:54,347
THE LOVE THAT IS BETWEEN
LOVERS IS JUST A PART OF LIFE

2163
02:23:54,743 --> 02:23:59,487
IT IS A GRAVE MISTAKE TO KILL SOMEONE
OR KILL YOURSELVES DUE TO LOVE FAILURE.

2164
02:23:59,764 --> 02:24:01,818
TRY TO LOVE YOUR LIFE.

2165
02:24:02,042 --> 02:24:03,914
SEE HOW GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL IT WOULD BE!

2166
02:24:04,146 --> 02:24:06,253
WE AREN'T BORN TO FAIL OR DIE.

2167
02:24:06,669 --> 02:24:07,869
WE ARE BORN TO LAST.

2168
02:24:08,239 --> 02:24:09,871
GET UP. PICK YOURSELVES
UP EVERYTIME YOU FALL.

2169
02:24:09,958 --> 02:24:11,159
GET HEALED EVERYTIME YOU'RE INJURED.

2170
02:24:11,653 --> 02:24:12,914
WAGE A WAR WITH YOUSELF.

2171
02:24:13,296 --> 02:24:14,325
WIN OVER YOURSELF.

2172
02:24:14,666 --> 02:24:15,914
THAT IS LIFE.
