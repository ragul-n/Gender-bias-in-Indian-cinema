1
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:39,875
<i>Please pay attention.</i>

2
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:44,291
<i>The last local for Borivali</i>

3
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,166
<i>is arriving at platform three
at 11:20 p.m…</i>

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,625
<i>Next station: Goregaon.</i>

5
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:07,500
<i>The darkness will creep up behind you
To sting.</i>

6
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:15,583
<i>Time will outrun you
The morning is still far away.</i>

7
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:23,458
<i>Only darkness shall stand by you
Till the end.</i>

8
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,958
<i>Accidents lurk at every step.</i>

9
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,708
<i>Waiting to pounce on you.</i>

10
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:41,250
<i>They'll latch onto you
Even if you try to get away.</i>

11
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,791
Yeah, Harsh?

12
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,875
<i>We found one more.</i>

13
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,166
Okay, I'm coming.

14
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,000
Who found it?

15
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,500
An on-duty lineman.

16
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,250
Anyone touched it yet?

17
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,041
No. You'd given instructions,

18
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,916
so the police informed us directly.

19
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:03,666
Any footprints?

20
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,500
No.

21
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,208
The bag is of the same size.

22
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,375
Hmm.

23
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,291
The method is similar too.

24
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,541
Once again, he kills her
somewhere else

25
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,916
and dumps the body here
for our convenience.

26
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,625
How sweet of him!

27
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,750
We should personally
thank him for this.

28
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,333
Just wait till we meet him.

29
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,416
Harsh.

30
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,958
Question those people.

31
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,333
Ask them if they saw something.

32
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:05,916
Okay.

33
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,083
Vivaan.

34
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,166
Hmm?

35
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,125
Ever seen something like this before?

36
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,791
Fourth corpse
in the last four months.

37
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,541
This is bad news for us.

38
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,833
We must locate
the actual crime scene, Harsh.

39
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,125
At any cost.

40
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,458
No, Vivaan.

41
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:50,541
I don't think we'll find a clue
at the actual crime scene.

42
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,375
He doesn't look like someone
who makes mistakes.

43
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,250
He's too smart.

44
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,166
Murder for him
is not just lust or violence.

45
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,416
It's about possession.
It gives him a high.

46
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,333
Once he realizes his victims

47
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,833
are breathless and
are inching closer to their deaths,

48
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,416
it literally trips him out.

49
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,541
That's exactly when
he'd make a mistake.

50
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:17,375
Hopefully!

51
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,583
And we need to find that mistake.

52
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,291
That's when our investigation
will find a proper direction.

53
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,583
Footprints, hair sample,
we could find anything.

54
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,250
Poor Mishra lost all his hair

55
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,166
in a bid to find the hair samples.

56
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,336
He was left only with samples,
lost all his hair.

57
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,457
What do you think?

58
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,457
You're right.
Mr Mishra was a great investigator.

59
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,457
I think, he'd use Google
for his searches.

60
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,083
"Top ten ways to catch a
serial killer" or something.

61
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,458
Frankly, I'm glad
he was transferred.

62
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,666
Do you think
I don't look that stuff up?

63
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,916
The Internet is down
or else the killer would have been…

64
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,125
- You would've screwed him, right?
- Obviously.

65
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,500
<i>This night is too short
For our long chats.</i>

66
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,583
<i>Why are you so aloof?</i>

67
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:14,958
<i>This night is too short
For our long chats.</i>

68
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,000
- Hi, Richa.
- Hello.

69
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,708
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

70
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,541
School?

71
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,000
College.

72
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,666
In Delhi, you call it school,

73
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,750
in Mumbai
after tenth grade, it's college.

74
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,791
I'm so sorry. I tend to forget.

75
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,875
Yes, going to college.

76
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,875
Isn't your college opposite
that famous <i>vadapav </i>joint?

77
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,125
Very funny.

78
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,875
- That joint is opposite my college.
- I see.

79
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,458
How will you get there?

80
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,541
A rickshaw to the railway station
and then I'll walk from there.

81
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,750
In this weather, you won't find
a rickshaw. Let me drop you.

82
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,250
No, it's okay.

83
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,666
Hello, Ms Okay.

84
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,541
Everything is okay, okay?

85
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,631
Give me the umbrella.
I'll bring my car around.

86
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,375
How am I looking?

87
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,541
- Good.
- Cool.

88
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,211
<i>This is the fourth murder
by the Strolley Killer.</i>

89
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,250
<i>Local trains are considered
the lifeline of Mumbai.</i>

90
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,541
<i>What measures are the government
taking for their safety?</i>

91
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,500
<i>Or are they just
twiddling their thumbs?</i>

92
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,291
<i>The fourth murder
took place on the Western line</i>

93
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,583
<i>where four million people
commute every day.</i>

94
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,083
<i>Who will take
their responsibility?</i>

95
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,625
<i>Does the government
have an answer?</i>

96
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,500
A senior officer of this department
would often say:

97
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,375
"To understand an artist,

98
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,166
you must look at his
paintings carefully."

99
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,750
But this artist and his paintings…

100
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,125
I just don't understand.

101
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,500
Why does he stuff the corpses
in bags before dumping them?

102
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,083
The killer saws off his victims' feet
and keeps them.

103
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,000
Expecting logic from this guy
is a waste of time.

104
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,208
Did the latest victim
also wear open footwear?

105
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,625
It is not confirmed yet, sir.

106
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,375
But based on the killer's pattern,

107
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,666
I'm sure Rita Madhav must have
worn open footwear.

108
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,458
Hmm.

109
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:55,291
Apart from the fact that all
the victims traveled by train,

110
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,708
you found any common factors
or connections?

111
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,083
No, sir.
Nothing so far.

112
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,208
None of them knew each other

113
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,625
and there's no common factor.

114
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,708
But this is what
we're trying to crack.

115
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,875
The day we find the common factor…

116
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,891
We'll be very close to catching
this guy.

117
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,000
Vivaan, we have to catch this monster
as early as possible.

118
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,041
Yes, sir.

119
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,625
Even Mishra couldn't find anything.

120
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,416
And you know the pressures.

121
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,750
And I don't want to be
a part of any news debate

122
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,375
where I have to defend myself.

123
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,458
Yes, sir.

124
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,500
Let our actions speak.
I trust you.

125
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,708
- Yes, sir.
- That's why you're here.

126
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,875
- Sir.
- Hmm, Rishabh?

127
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That night,
she left at around 10 p.m.

128
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,750
Her friends said
she always traveled by train.

129
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,875
- What about her family?
- Locals.

130
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,083
She lived with her parents
in Goregaon.

131
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,250
Dad is a banker
and mom, a housewife.

132
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,291
Goregaon Station, 10th August.

133
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,750
Line up the CCTV footage.

134
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,416
Maybe she got off
the train after 10:30.

135
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,708
- Find and you call me immediately, okay?
- Okay, sir.

136
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,291
- Vivaan.
- Huh?

137
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,875
I got a call from the lab.

138
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,666
Did you find something new
or same as before?

139
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,916
I'm afraid, no.

140
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,583
The MO is identical.

141
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:19,125
No signs of sexual assault
on her body.

142
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,000
The victim has died
due to asphyxiation.

143
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:21,958
She was deprived of oxy…

144
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,041
Yes, I understand.
Asphyxiation.

145
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,333
Look at her legs.

146
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,708
Her feet were chopped off
by a saw or something.

147
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,083
That's why it's a little uneven.

148
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,541
There are no traces of saliva,

149
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,708
fingerprints, blood or hair
on her body.

150
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,583
That means, same as before.

151
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,291
And the strolley bag?

152
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,250
Clean.

153
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,333
It's useless.

154
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,375
Let me see.

155
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,708
I'd feel so terrible.

156
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,250
I couldn't imagine the plight
of the victims' families.

157
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,208
They must go through a lot.

158
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,541
Never knew
there would come a day

159
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,208
when I also would have to…

160
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,541
It's fine.

161
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,625
Yeah, you wanted
to ask me something?

162
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,708
Right.

163
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,291
Did she make any new friends…

164
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,833
Anything odd about
that relationship?

165
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,708
No.

166
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,666
Rita was a decent girl.

167
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,958
She'd focus on work, had only
a few friends in our neighbourhood.

168
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,666
Do you think that whatever
happened to Rita

169
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,666
- was done by someone she knew?
- No.

170
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,833
Look, we can't confirm anything
right now, Mr Madhav.

171
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,833
We're checking every lead.

172
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,416
If you recall anything,

173
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,208
or if you find out something,
do inform us.

174
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,708
Did Rita ever tell you
that someone was following her

175
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,208
or did she suspect
she was being followed?

176
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,708
No.

177
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,625
Never.

178
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,291
I found no leads from
this strolley bag.

179
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,083
It is just like those
other three bags.

180
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:30,166
There are almost 288
registered stores in Mumbai.

181
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,583
There must be thousands
across Maharashtra.

182
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,875
- If it was bought from another state…
- Forget it.

183
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,125
Once we narrow down
the search criteria,

184
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,083
then we'll waste time on it.
Don't sweat it.

185
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,916
Sir, I found it.

186
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,375
Look at the left corner.

187
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,916
Estimated time of death?

188
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,416
Approximately at midnight.

189
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:59,375
The footage says 11:35.
Almost half an hour.

190
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:03,208
The strolley bag was found
almost 100 meters from the station.

191
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,208
Right.

192
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,708
Harsh.

193
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,500
- Get all the units.
- Okay.

194
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,250
Rishabh, a little further.

195
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,000
Jadhav, look there.

196
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,791
Look here.

197
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,458
Sir, check this out.

198
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:35,708
Come here!

199
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,333
Come, sir.

200
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,041
Look at this.

201
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,625
I think this is it.

202
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,875
Of course, this is it.

203
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,375
Okay, so…

204
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,875
The victim's house is almost

205
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,208
two-hundred meters from here
in the east.

206
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,208
Suppose she…

207
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,165
Took this route…

208
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,000
The suspect waited for a while,

209
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,708
attacked her at the right moment.

210
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,375
Then he carried her…

211
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,165
And brought her here.

212
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,208
Right! This is the spot.

213
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,833
And then…

214
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,458
Maybe he took 15 minutes
to chop her feet off.

215
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,296
And then may be he double-checked
if she's dead.

216
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,333
His planning is near perfect,

217
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,250
so he must've hidden
the strolley bag somewhere here.

218
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,458
Look for the
wheel marks of the bag.

219
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,791
- Check it.
- Yes, sir.

220
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,208
Okay.

221
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,541
So now…

222
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,625
He had to take
the strolley bag to the final spot.

223
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,333
He took the victim there…

224
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,833
And stuffed her in the bag.

225
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And…

226
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,208
Sir.

227
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,666
Footprint.

228
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,875
<i>The CBI seems to have found new
evidence in the Strolley Killer Case.</i>

229
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,666
<i>Even though the same
hasn't been confirmed,</i>

230
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,208
<i>it is possible
that this evidence</i>

231
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,125
<i>will tilt this case
into a new direction</i>

232
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,333
<i>and the CBI might
catch the perp soon.</i>

233
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,291
Hello.

234
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,833
Hello, how are you?

235
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,041
I'm fine.
I just have a headache, that's all.

236
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,583
Richa?

237
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
At college.

238
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,333
She didn't even eat breakfast.

239
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,208
- She was running late, so she left.
- I see.

240
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,041
Did you find a cook?

241
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,015
No, you were going
to send someone, right?

242
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,541
Oh damn!

243
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,291
I am getting so forgetful.

244
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,791
- I'll tell you as soon as I find one.
- No problem.

245
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,833
- Please let me know.
- Sure.

246
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,416
- Okay, bye.
- Okay.

247
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,458
Rishabh has something to show you.

248
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,125
Then say it, Rishabh.

249
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,791
Only you have something to say,
not us.

250
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,083
I can neither find a cook
nor a clue to the killer.

251
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,333
Sir…

252
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,916
I see a strange connection
in this case.

253
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,000
I mean, take a look.

254
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,791
These are the CCTV videos

255
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,515
from stations
for second and third murder.

256
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,958
Look at this man, sir.

257
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,791
In both videos, when the victim
walked past him,

258
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,958
he started following her
like a shadow.

259
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,625
There is more.

260
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,041
This is the first and fourth.

261
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,833
Exactly similar style, sir.

262
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,958
So a similar looking man

263
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,083
got off the train
as an ordinary passenger

264
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,750
and followed the victim.

265
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,166
I'm damn sure, sir,
it's the same guy.

266
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,875
Same height, same built.

267
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,583
What do you think, Vivaan?

268
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,166
Is he the one?

269
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,375
I don't know. What are the odds!

270
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,058
It couldn't have been
a mere coincidence.

271
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,500
Four murders, four men of the same
built, similar khaki pants.

272
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,416
The boot print was
size ten, right?

273
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,500
Right.

274
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,708
He is almost 5'11.

275
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:15,958
Yes, almost.

276
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,500
I think it's him.

277
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:28,833
It means

278
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,583
he doesn't choose
his victims randomly.

279
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,833
He follows them
and then kills them.

280
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,291
Sir…

281
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,416
All the victims boarded
the train from Bandra.

282
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,166
Should I check the footage?

283
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,125
Maybe a better shot
while boarding the train?

284
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,333
It's pointless.

285
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,458
He's wearing a cap for a reason.

286
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,875
He knows the angles
of the CCTV cameras.

287
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,017
He won't make the mistake
of showing his face anywhere.

288
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,166
He's too smart.

289
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,458
These khaki pants look
like a taxi driver's uniform.

290
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,750
It could be.

291
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,666
Maybe the killer is a taxi driver.

292
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,708
It's possible.

293
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,083
If he carries a strolley bag,
nobody would suspect him.

294
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,583
Yes, but can a taxi driver
be that smart?

295
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,375
We don't know if a taxi driver
can be that smart,

296
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,416
but the killer is definitely
smart enough

297
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,666
to disguise himself
as a taxi driver and kill.

298
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,958
Send a team to
the Western line stations.

299
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,791
Check if anyone saw something suspicious.

300
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,958
Inquire with every
stall and bar around the area.

301
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:30,083
Okay, sir.

302
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,000
- Harsh.
- Yes?

303
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,041
Get a list
of all the taxi permits issued

304
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,605
in the past six months
from the union.

305
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,625
Okay.

306
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,291
- Vivaan.
- Sir.

307
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,351
I got a call from
the Commissioner's office.

308
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,416
Three knives were found in
a taxi driver's bag at a checkpoint.

309
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,583
They were covered in blood.

310
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,250
The cops wanted to stop him,

311
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,833
but he tried to escape.

312
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,333
Where is he now?

313
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,958
Bandra Police Station.

314
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,708
It's being said
that the suspect apprehended

315
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,958
is the Strolley Killer.

316
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,291
He had caused much trouble
for the people of Mumbai.

317
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,875
It's still an ongoing investigation.

318
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,791
Shit.

319
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,791
Who invited the circus?

320
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,708
Someone tipped them off.

321
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,750
You give a tip
and also receive a tip later.

322
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,208
Get them out of here.

323
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,291
- Kamble, throw them out.
- Sure.

324
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:38,833
Who caught him?

325
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,833
Constable Jiten Mangley.

326
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,416
- Mangley!
- Yes, sir.

327
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,291
Let's start from the beginning.

328
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,375
It's routine, sir.

329
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,875
It was a routine checkpoint
at Hill Road.

330
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,708
I stopped him and searched his cab.

331
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,458
I found a bag.

332
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,125
I asked him about the contents,
he tried to flee.

333
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,708
So I chased him right away.

334
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:06,500
I jumped over a divider, chased him
for more than half a mile.

335
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:07,791
I nabbed him finally.

336
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:10,958
Where is he now?

337
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,000
In the remand room.

338
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,291
Your name?

339
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,500
Shashikant More, sir.

340
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,500
Why did you try to run?

341
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm a poor man.

342
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,333
Those cops…

343
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,875
I mean the officers caught me.

344
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,958
They wanted to search my cab.

345
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,250
I had cannabis in my bag.

346
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,791
I was headed for a delivery.

347
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,208
I tried to flee
because I was scared.

348
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,083
Cannabis?

349
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,750
I drive a cab at night.

350
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,666
It doesn't pay much these days.

351
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,291
Then this Uber
and other cab services…

352
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,166
It just ruined my business.

353
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,291
My family lives in a village.

354
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,666
I have kids.

355
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,166
I need money to raise them.

356
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,916
So I moonlight once a while.

357
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,250
And the three knives?

358
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,125
The blood on them…

359
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,750
Those are not mine!
They belong to Arshad.

360
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,833
I told the officer
they weren't mine.

361
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,291
But he didn't listen.

362
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,583
You should check them.

363
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,208
Arshad is from my village.

364
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,666
He is a butcher, sir.

365
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,666
He owns a chicken shop in Ma him.

366
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,416
Sir, if you don't believe me,

367
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,208
come with me. I'll show you.

368
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,041
He went back to the village
and left those knives in my bag.

369
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,791
I'm so damn unlucky.

370
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:34,708
Sir.

371
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:36,500
I'm very poor.

372
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm very poor, sir!

373
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,875
Sir, please let me go.

374
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,333
Forgive me.

375
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,416
Check if he's telling the truth.

376
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,833
He's a hustler,
he can't be the Strolley Killer.

377
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,708
Strolley Killer!
Anyway, I hate the name strolley killer.

378
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,916
Oh! Finally!

379
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,208
I thought you'd never show up.

380
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,041
Actually, that's what I thought.

381
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,875
I can't help it.
I can't find a cook.

382
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:20,708
So I decided to eat home-cooked
meal instead of eating out.

383
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:23,083
- Oh wow!
- Nobody refuses free drinks, right?

384
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,541
The blood report is here.

385
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,958
The blood on the knife
was of chicken.

386
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,125
I'm so surprised, Harsh.

387
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,125
Look.

388
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:32,416
We even found two witnesses.

389
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:35,017
He was in his village
at the time of the second murder

390
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,333
and he drove to Virar
at the time of the third.

391
00:25:38,416 --> 00:25:40,000
That's what I like about you.

392
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,125
You follow orders,

393
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,625
but not before checking the facts.

394
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,583
Absolutely.

395
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,416
Good! Keeps a check on me, Harsh.

396
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,708
Yes, come.

397
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,458
An is ha.

398
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,166
- Hey, An is ha. So sorry, I'm late.
- Hi, Vivaan.

399
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,125
No problem.
I just finished cooking.

400
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,208
Superb, great.

401
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:58,000
Vivaan, this is my college friend,
Devika.

402
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,208
Hi.

403
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,458
Hi. Vivaan.

404
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,750
- Hi, Devika. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

405
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:05,041
Devika, he is my boss.

406
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:06,666
Hey!

407
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,500
Devika is a… PD…

408
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,958
- Pediatrician.
- Yes.

409
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,291
Kids' doctor.

410
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,833
You know, sometimes I wonder how
you passed the bureau exam.

411
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:17,083
You must have cheated.
Come on, be honest.

412
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,666
- Cheating…
- That's how he married me.

413
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,041
Man!

414
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,875
I heard at a seminar

415
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,666
that a particular event
in their lives

416
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,375
acts as a trigger.

417
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:31,583
That trigger turns these normal
people into the Devil.

418
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,791
For years, researchers have been trying
to find out

419
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:36,208
what triggers them, as you said

420
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,333
what makes someone
a serial killer or a psychopath.

421
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,333
But there are no concrete answers
so far.

422
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,083
But there's one thing.

423
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,083
All serial killers are psychopathic.

424
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:47,625
But all psychopaths
are not serial killers.

425
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,791
You know, Vivaan?

426
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:51,583
Devika is obsessed with stories

427
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:52,767
- about serial killers.
- What!

428
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,151
- I'm not obsessed, okay?
- Really?

429
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:57,083
But yes, I'm definitely fascinated.

430
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,666
- Really?
- Yes.

431
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,250
I mean, it is fascinating

432
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,500
that most of these serial killers
look so unassuming, right?

433
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:05,708
They look normal.

434
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,000
Middle-class, 9 to 5 types.

435
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,958
But when you decipher
their thoughts

436
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,161
that's when you get shocked.

437
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:15,333
A few days ago, I was telling
someone about Ted Bundy.

438
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:16,875
I mean,

439
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:20,125
nobody could look at him
and say he was a necrophiliac.

440
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:22,791
Having sex with his victims'
dead bodies

441
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:24,625
until they start decomposing!

442
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,250
You know, there are many
jerks like Ted Bundy.

443
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,375
Have you read about
Jerry Brudos?

444
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:32,684
- Somewhat similar to our killer. You must be knowing.
- Yeah.

445
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,916
He was also obsessed
with ladies' footwear.

446
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:37,791
Once, he killed a 19-year-old girl

447
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:41,250
and chopped off her left leg
for his personal collection.

448
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,875
Before disposing of the body,

449
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,333
he'd cut his victims' right breast

450
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:49,375
and make a mold out of it
to use it as a paper weight.

451
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,000
Wow!

452
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,833
Yeah, fascinating, isn't it?

453
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,666
Okay, enough now.

454
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,583
Please exchange numbers, guys.

455
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:59,791
You can have this intense
conversation elsewhere, okay?

456
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,708
For now,
shall we continue the game?

457
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:02,916
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sorry.

458
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:13,791
<i>The next train expected at
platform three…</i>

459
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,291
Yeah, Harsh?

460
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,708
Foot Fairy.

461
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,750
It seems, he also didn't like
the name Strolley Killer.

462
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:05,083
Who found it?

463
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,625
The slum kids.

464
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,375
They come here to play
every day.

465
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,166
Crime scene?

466
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,916
In a ladies' restroom close by.

467
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,291
There is blood everywhere.

468
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,291
Any footprints?

469
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,166
No.

470
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:23,541
The floor was wet.

471
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,833
His confidence is growing
by the day.

472
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,208
This time, he didn't even try
to hide the crime scene.

473
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,833
His murder rate is also increasing.

474
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:35,750
Two this month.

475
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,291
And the month hasn't even ended yet.

476
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:41,458
Sir.

477
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,666
Why did he change the pattern
this time?

478
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,583
He didn't change his pattern.

479
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,541
He is being overconfident.

480
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:21,458
He is bored of dumping bodies
in strolley bags.

481
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:23,875
Now he's playing games with us.

482
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,625
He's challenging us.

483
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,125
This makes one thing very clear.

484
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:34,541
He doesn't miss
any piece of news about himself.

485
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,250
In fact…

486
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,125
He'd be collecting news articles.

487
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,333
He waits for the Foot Fairy news
to hit the channels.

488
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,250
He gets high
by dominating his victims

489
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:49,166
and now he wants to be a celebrity,
to be seen on every news channel.

490
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,666
Bastard!

491
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:51,875
He's loving it.

492
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:57,291
Now we must think like him, Harsh.

493
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:58,791
Hmm.

494
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,750
Mr Deshmukh.

495
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,250
- Yes?
- It is semen.

496
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,000
We are sending
this sample to Delhi

497
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:05,958
for cross-referencing.

498
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:07,916
Only they have a DNA database

499
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,583
- of sexual offenders.
- Right. Okay.

500
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,375
- We'll keep in touch.
- Okay, thanks.

501
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:18,250
Vivaan, do you really think
the semen belongs to the killer?

502
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,458
Honestly, I think this semen

503
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,333
doesn't belong to the killer.

504
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,416
Think about it.

505
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:31,250
He never even
left a hair strand behind.

506
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,500
Suddenly we found
a tsunami of semen!

507
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:34,791
Why?

508
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,791
A tsunami of semen?

509
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:44,125
Honestly!

510
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:46,291
Harsh, you're a funny guy.

511
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:47,625
A tsunami of semen.

512
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:48,958
That's a good one.

513
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,666
Look, I'm not sure

514
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:58,041
if this tsunami of semen,
as you say, belongs to the Foot Fairy.

515
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,041
But let's see!
Let's find out whom it belongs to.

516
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,958
And remember that
one mistake, Harsh.

517
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,375
Mistakes are made
when you're high.

518
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:09,250
Maybe that's his mistake.

519
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,083
Hmm.

520
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,500
By the way,
it's Vanessa's prayer meeting today.

521
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,750
Vanessa D'Souza,
the first victim.

522
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So?

523
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,250
Hari, come in.
Anything?

524
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:35,708
No, sir.

525
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:51,916
Sir.

526
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:53,625
Do you think

527
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,625
he'll show up?

528
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I don't know.

529
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,291
But there's no harm if we try.

530
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:04,125
There are many cases

531
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:06,583
where the killer visits their victims.

532
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,708
You know, on special days
like birthdays.

533
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,083
It gives them a sense of power.

534
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,083
Hmm.

535
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,833
Power?

536
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:24,125
Imagine you have a power to
decide who should live or die,

537
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,833
won't you consider yourself God?

538
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,208
Sir?

539
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,166
He's here, he's here.

540
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,875
- Shit!
- Hurry!

541
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,520
Hari, he's on the run!
He's on the run!

542
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,125
- He's getting away.
- Move!

543
00:37:47,541 --> 00:37:49,333
He's getting away.

544
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:50,833
Get him!

545
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,416
- Come on!
- Hurry!

546
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,625
This way!

547
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:00,500
He went that way.

548
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,958
- Wait!
- Hey! Get him!

549
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,666
Cover the back exit!

550
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:55,875
Wait!

551
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,666
- Move it!
- Move your vehicle!

552
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,000
Hurry up!

553
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,250
Move it!

554
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:15,583
Shit!

555
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,916
Rishabh, check the footprints.

556
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,083
<i>Okay, sir.</i>

557
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:41,708
Good evening, everyone.

558
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,583
As you all know,

559
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:47,041
this killer communicated
with us directly.

560
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,125
He…

561
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:50,916
Called himself the Foot Fairy.

562
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,458
More details will be delivered
by Vivaan Deshmukh.

563
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:56,875
Assistant Joint Director,
Special Crimes Division.

564
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:01,000
He took charge of this case
a couple of days ago.

565
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:05,541
Good evening, everyone.

566
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:08,083
As you all may know,

567
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,875
we're still investigating this.

568
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,458
So I can't share
all the information with you.

569
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,916
But I can assure you
that we're trying our best.

570
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,750
We found some evidence
that is being evaluated now.

571
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,166
You can help us
find the culprit too.

572
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,250
We've set up a hotline number

573
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:28,250
that you can call on
to contact us any time of the day.

574
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:31,416
Our guess is that the killer
has an average built.

575
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:34,708
He may be 25 to 35 years old.

576
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:37,708
Approximate height: 5'11.

577
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,750
If you find someone suspicious,

578
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:42,125
please call the hotline
immediately

579
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:45,125
or you may head to a branch
of Special Crimes Division.

580
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:48,666
Your safety is our responsibility.

581
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:51,125
Please stay alert.

582
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:55,416
<i>We know that the people
of Mumbai consider themselves safe</i>

583
00:40:56,375 --> 00:41:00,208
<i>and we hope to maintain that trust.</i>

584
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,916
<i>Thank you.
Glory to India.</i>

585
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,750
Look at you.
You don't look nervous at all.

586
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:07,500
- Handling like a pro, huh!
- What rubbish!

587
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:10,083
I hate media briefings, interviews

588
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,291
or any kind of public speaking.

589
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,458
I hate it!

590
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:14,541
- Really?
- Yeah.

591
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:17,333
I thought you got used to it
after the Yamuna River Case.

592
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:20,333
Okay, tell me.

593
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,166
How's the investigation going?

594
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:24,666
Fine.

595
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,583
- Fine?
- Yeah.

596
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,750
You know? This is what everyone
talks about even during breaks.

597
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:30,750
Really?

598
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,642
I think it's become
the favorite topic of the nation.

599
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:33,583
- You're right.
- Like…

600
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:35,506
The nation wants to know
who the Foot Fairy is.

601
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:38,375
The nation wants to know
who the Foot Fairy is!

602
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,708
- Okay.
- I see.

603
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,041
Shh, sorry, sorry.

604
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,041
By the way, do you guys
treat patients at the hospital

605
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,666
or do you kill your time
with gossip out there?

606
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:49,833
Very funny!

607
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,583
But yes, who doesn't like mysteries?

608
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,333
Okay, tell me.

609
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,041
If a girl has dirty feet…

610
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,416
Dirty!

611
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,291
Do you think he'll attack her?

612
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm sorry, dirty means?

613
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:06,333
- You know? Like dirty. Cracked skin…
- Oh my God!

614
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,250
- Yuck! Stop it!
- Not pedicured, smelly.

615
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,166
- What?
- Gosh! Disgusting!

616
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,916
I've lost my appetite.

617
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:16,541
Tell me.

618
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:20,083
Well, you know,
everyone has a secret obsession.

619
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,291
This Foot Fairy could have too.

620
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:24,958
Just imagine,

621
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,125
he collects his victims' feet.

622
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:30,375
Only he knows
what goes on in his head.

623
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:34,416
You think the Foot Fairy
would like my feet?

624
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:36,125
I mean, you think he'll attack me?

625
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:39,541
Are my feet pretty enough
for the Foot Fairy?

626
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:44,875
Are they pretty enough?

627
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,541
No more questions,
this press conference is over.

628
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:49,875
Thank you for coming.

629
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,666
The food was actually good.

630
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,000
- It was great.
- Yeah.

631
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,928
- It was even better because of you…
- Yeah.

632
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,833
- Is this your car?
- Yes, it is.

633
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:08,166
I'll see you. Bye.

634
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:10,333
Thank you.

635
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:13,041
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

636
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:14,833
- See you.
- Take care.

637
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,291
Well, your feet are pretty.

638
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,666
Okay, Star! Get in.

639
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,458
So how is school?

640
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,708
College. Fine.
How's college?

641
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:04,871
What's going on these days?

642
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:06,583
It's good.
We're busy with exams.

643
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,041
Exams?

644
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:11,333
- All the best. Do well.
- Thank you.

645
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:13,583
- Did you prepare?
- Yes.

646
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:18,583
By what time do you get back home?

647
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:20,250
Mostly by 8 p.m.

648
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:22,791
After extra lessons, I chill with
my friends for a while

649
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:24,791
then I catch the 7:12 p.m.
express train.

650
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:28,958
Okay.

651
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,666
Hello?

652
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,750
<i>Mr Deshmukh?</i>

653
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,583
This is Murthy from FSL, Delhi.

654
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:47,041
Yes, Mr Murthy?

655
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:48,875
You had sent evidence

656
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,041
item number 566

657
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,458
<i>- 34J56, right?</i>
- Yes.

658
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,291
We found a positive match.

659
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:55,375
Oh, that's great.

660
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,458
The sample is of Ravi Kale.

661
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,333
Last year,
Mumbai Police arrested him

662
00:45:00,416 --> 00:45:02,041
<i>- for a sexual assault.</i>
- I see.

663
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,125
In October.

664
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,208
Last year.

665
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:06,458
Do you have his address?

666
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:07,958
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

667
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:09,833
That's okay, I'll find it.

668
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,958
Please email me the report.

669
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:12,875
<i>I'll do that.</i>

670
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:13,958
Thank you, Mr Murthy.

671
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:21,666
Sir.

672
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,791
Ravi Kale.

673
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,708
We arrested him last year

674
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,416
for sexual assault.

675
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:29,083
But we didn't find
any evidence against him,

676
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:30,625
he was released in ten days.

677
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,125
Do you have his latest address?

678
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,208
Yes, I do.

679
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,416
He lives nearby.

680
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,750
Is he there yet?

681
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,791
<i>Not yet, sir.</i>

682
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:48,291
Okay, okay.

683
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,541
Are you sure he still lives here?

684
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,291
Yes, sir. Hundred percent.

685
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:55,666
But I am not sure.

686
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:57,583
About what?

687
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:01,791
Whether he is
the Foot Fairy or not.

688
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:03,625
But he fits the profile

689
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:05,708
based on the sexual charges.

690
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:06,833
He is well-educated.

691
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:08,083
His shoe size is 10

692
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:10,500
and lives close to the crime scene.

693
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:13,666
Most importantly, his semen
was found near the body.

694
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:16,708
Harsh,

695
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:18,958
has your semen

696
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,333
ever ended up somewhere
it shouldn't be?

697
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,833
<i>He's going to the left,
a girl is with him.</i>

698
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:38,125
Okay, grab him as soon
as he gets out.

699
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:39,875
He is here.

700
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:58,708
- Back off!
- Move, move!

701
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,583
Get him!

702
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,875
- From the side!
- Stop!

703
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:06,875
Catch him!

704
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,833
Turn around.

705
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,250
Why run if you did nothing wrong?

706
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,083
I swear, I did nothing wrong.

707
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:49,500
I thought he was Afzal's man.

708
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,000
I'd borrowed 300,000 from him.

709
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:56,375
Now I don't even have a job.
How do I pay him back?

710
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:57,958
We found your magazine

711
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,208
that had your prints
and your semen.

712
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:03,458
It was three feet
away from the body.

713
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:05,666
Magazine?

714
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:07,750
- Which magazine? What…
- Hey!

715
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:09,500
Stop this drama.

716
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:12,750
Confess your crime
or we'll break your bones. Okay?

717
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:15,791
I did nothing wrong.
What should I confess?

718
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,000
Sir, I'm telling the truth.

719
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:20,125
I know nothing about a magazine.

720
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:23,583
Look.

721
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,041
Do you remember it now?

722
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:32,500
You turned this soft cover into
a hard cover and you don't remember?

723
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:35,750
How can I tell you about this?
I'm embarrassed.

724
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:39,000
Start talking!
Once I beat the hell out of you,

725
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,500
you will be embarrassed forever.

726
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:42,958
Get it?

727
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:44,708
Get it?

728
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:47,833
Speak up!

729
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:51,458
Sir, I live in a small house

730
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,375
and my relatives have come over.

731
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:58,250
I took the magazine to my car

732
00:48:58,708 --> 00:48:59,875
and jerked off a bit…

733
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:00,958
A bit?

734
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:02,500
You call this a bit?

735
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,375
I felt relieved.

736
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:08,333
Then I threw this magazine
near the railway track.

737
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:10,083
I swear, sir.

738
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:13,666
Forgive me, sir.
I haven't done anything else.

739
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,666
I'm telling the truth.

740
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:20,958
What do you think?

741
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:22,791
Is he telling the truth?

742
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:24,208
I'm not sure, sir.

743
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:27,125
Hold him in custody.

744
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,375
Take good care of him.

745
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:30,208
We might find out something more.

746
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:34,875
Sir, I feel really bad for him.

747
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:36,916
Why?

748
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,666
Poor man…

749
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,500
He just went out to jerk off

750
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:42,250
and that shook up his whole life.

751
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:18,416
Yes, Dr Bhogle?

752
00:50:18,666 --> 00:50:19,791
<i>Yes, Mr Deshmukh.</i>

753
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:21,833
<i>The handwriting analyst
has confirmed</i>

754
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:24,541
<i>that the body inscriptions
and the suspect's handwriting</i>

755
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:25,916
<i>don't match.</i>

756
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:28,208
Okay, thank you.

757
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:31,958
Sir…

758
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,708
He has two strong witnesses.

759
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:35,333
Who?

760
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:36,958
On the night of the
fifth murder,

761
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,833
he was at
Sai Shakti Bar, Marine drive

762
00:50:38,916 --> 00:50:40,666
and on the night
of the third murder,

763
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,791
he was at Mantra Bar, Andheri East.

764
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,916
We are screwed again!

765
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,041
Back to zero again!

766
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:51,666
Forget it!

767
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,208
Let's have lunch.

768
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,125
The taxi union has sent a report.

769
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,583
275 permits were issued
in the last six months.

770
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,583
Should we follow up?

771
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:04,000
Let it be.

772
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,916
The taxi angle is wrong.

773
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,666
But where did we
get this angle from?

774
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,833
Sir…

775
00:51:09,916 --> 00:51:11,666
- The khaki pants.
- Right.

776
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:14,458
I own three khaki pants.
You would have too.

777
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:17,916
Anybody can wear khaki pants.

778
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:19,166
Yeah, right.

779
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:21,958
You were right, Harsh.

780
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,916
This semen can't belong to
the Foot Fairy.

781
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:25,791
We wasted our time.

782
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,458
No, Vivaan.

783
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,291
If I were in your place,
I would've done the same.

784
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,750
As a lead investigator,
you can't overlook any facts.

785
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Relax.

786
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:37,666
Don't take so much stress.

787
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:40,291
What is it?

788
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:42,083
Why are you looking here?

789
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:43,916
Eat your food.

790
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,000
Anyway…

791
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:57,250
We have to find something before
Mr Saleem's patience wears thin.

792
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,500
One more thing, sir.

793
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:02,750
There is a weird connection
in all the cases.

794
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:05,041
I mean, it may be
completely irrelevant.

795
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,166
- But…
- Say it.

796
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:07,583
Okay, sir.

797
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,625
There is a restaurant in Bandra.

798
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:10,916
So?

799
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:13,791
All our victims have visited it.

800
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:15,458
Two weeks before
they were murdered.

801
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:18,333
And three of them had gone there
two days before their murder.

802
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:19,958
And?

803
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:22,750
Why didn't you
tell us this earlier?

804
00:52:23,875 --> 00:52:25,958
You remembered everything
about khaki pants.

805
00:52:26,041 --> 00:52:27,750
Why didn't you say this earlier?

806
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:31,541
Get the details and send it
to me as soon as possible.

807
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,083
Yes, sir.

808
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:34,541
Listen.

809
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,070
I'm going to Thane Jail tomorrow.

810
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,375
The warden wants to see me.

811
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,083
There is a prisoner who wants to
share some information with us.

812
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,250
Shall we?

813
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,916
See if you can find anything.

814
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,333
Anything else?

815
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49,166
You want to eat
or to say something?

816
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,250
No, sir.

817
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:52,750
- Should I get the bill?
- Yes, sir.

818
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:07,458
Thanks, Vivaan for helping me shop.

819
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:08,625
My pleasure.

820
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,810
I thought it would be a great
opportunity for me to shop as well.

821
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,458
Why do you look so exhausted?

822
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:17,208
Didn't you sleep all night?

823
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:20,000
I just worked all night.

824
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:21,166
Any breakthrough?

825
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:26,416
Had we found any clue,
it would've been on the news by now.

826
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,875
I think the media will find
the Foot Fairy before we do.

827
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:34,000
So I won't get any
confidential information from you.

828
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:35,916
Like they say, if you tell me,

829
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,541
you'll have to shoot me, right?

830
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:38,625
Of course.

831
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:41,125
Is it?

832
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:42,291
Professional ethic!

833
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,500
Fine, Mr Vivaan Deshmukh.

834
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,458
I won't share my
highly confidential

835
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,333
baby medical files
with you then.

836
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:51,125
Doctor-patient code. Okay?

837
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:52,833
I never asked for them.

838
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,458
Not even if you do.

839
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,041
You ask all the questions.

840
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,166
- I see. I ask all the questions?
- Yes.

841
00:53:58,583 --> 00:53:59,666
Okay, fine.

842
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,416
Continue with your shopping.

843
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,166
No, I'm serious.

844
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:10,053
Ninety percent of the calls
are crank calls.

845
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:12,125
"I think my neighbour
is the Foot Fairy.

846
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:14,728
My father-in-law keeps staring
at my feet, he is the Foot Fairy.

847
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:16,750
My mother-in-law is
the Foot Fairy, arrest her."

848
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:17,708
Oh God.

849
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:20,125
It gets so irritating at times.

850
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:24,041
Sometimes I think the hotline
was a really bad idea.

851
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:27,750
It's like those crank calls
we'd make as kids.

852
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,750
I must tell you this.

853
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:32,625
The other day,
a client was telling me

854
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,041
that she doesn't
travel alone at night anymore

855
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:36,916
and also forbids her daughter.

856
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,541
She also asked her daughter

857
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:41,583
not to wear heels, stilettos or
any kind of fancy footwear.

858
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:42,875
Only sneakers.

859
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:44,333
The foot has to be fully covered.

860
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:46,541
What's the use of a pedicure then?

861
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:47,625
No use.

862
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:49,938
By the way, I'm not
surprised by this.

863
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,583
My friend Aditi

864
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:54,125
has stopped getting
pedicures from men.

865
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:56,291
These people don't
even travel by train. I mean,

866
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:58,500
this man kills people
near the railway station,

867
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,958
but the entire city is terrified.

868
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:04,291
Hello?

869
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:05,625
Yes?

870
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,083
Yes, Aditi?

871
00:55:07,166 --> 00:55:08,166
Hi.

872
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:09,958
Yes.

873
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,458
Yeah.

874
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:13,291
Yes.

875
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:15,250
Yes, he is here.

876
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:18,625
Yes.

877
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,291
What?

878
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:22,458
Did you solve the case?

879
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,708
Hundred percent,
he'll love the intern.

880
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:31,291
Aditi, I'll call you later. Okay?

881
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:32,750
Okay, bye.

882
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,708
What? Which case?

883
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:38,208
I was just telling you about her
and she called.

884
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,041
She was saying that…

885
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:42,750
There's a joint in Bandra
named Lock Stock &amp; Burgers.

886
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,125
The owner of that
joint is the Foot Fairy.

887
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,250
And she wants you
to go arrest him.

888
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:51,666
I think
I've heard this name before.

889
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:53,166
What name?

890
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,750
The one you were saying,
Lock Stock…

891
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:56,291
- Lock Stock &amp; Burgers?
- Yeah.

892
00:55:56,416 --> 00:55:57,708
Yes, you might have.

893
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:58,875
It's a famous joint.

894
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:03,166
Why does your friend think
that the owner is the Foot Fairy?

895
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:04,916
Aditi?

896
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:06,833
She is mad.
Totally crazy.

897
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:10,666
You know but this man is
obsessed with feet.

898
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:13,291
For the first time,
I've heard about a man

899
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,833
who goes to a spa this regularly.

900
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,583
And he keeps staring at
other women's feet.

901
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:22,666
And he advises them
about cracks, moisturizers…

902
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:26,333
Sea salt scrub
and things like that.

903
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:28,833
- He advised me once, but I ignored it.
- Is it?

904
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:30,458
A very knowledgeable guy.

905
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:33,125
In fact, he is the first man

906
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:35,875
who only looks at women's feet.

907
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:37,986
Otherwise you know
where men look.

908
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:40,125
We will definitely arrest him.

909
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:42,583
Do you know him?

910
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:43,875
Why?

911
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:45,583
Are you jealous?

912
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,375
Jealous?

913
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Yes?

914
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:51,708
He just looks at feet, right?

915
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,375
Is it?

916
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,708
Wow, very smart, Mr Vivaan Deshmukh.

917
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
Having fun?

918
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,958
- Your parcel, sir.
- Oh, that was quick.

919
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:46,041
Yeah.

920
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:48,125
By the way, who owns this place?

921
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:50,333
Sorry, I don't know
who owns this property.

922
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:52,541
No, not the property.
I mean this restaurant.

923
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:54,000
Oh! Mr Joshua, sir.

924
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:55,333
- Mr. Joshua?
- Yeah.

925
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:56,708
Is he from Mumbai?

926
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,625
No, he is not from Mumbai,

927
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:00,416
but he's been around
here for months.

928
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,541
But sir, I don't know
much about it.

929
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:04,208
I mean I'm here since March,

930
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:05,208
the day this joint was opened.

931
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,166
That's it.

932
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,333
Can I meet him?

933
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:09,226
As in I want to congratulate him,
you know…

934
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,625
Such a wonderful place,
lovely interiors

935
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:13,291
such a friendly staff,
quick service.

936
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:15,958
Thank you, sir, but sorry,
he is out of the city now.

937
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,541
He'll back in a few days.

938
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:19,958
- He'll meet you next time when you come.
- Okay.

939
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:20,958
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, sir.

940
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:22,392
- Thank you, visit again, sir.
- Sure, sure.

941
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:23,416
- Okay.
- Bye, sir.

942
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,208
Vivaan.

943
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,500
Do you really think the
restaurant owner is a suspect?

944
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:36,250
Are you serious?

945
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,541
You aren't joking, right?

946
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:40,458
Have you seen his Facebook page?

947
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:42,250
I checked it out last night.

948
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:45,291
He has liked many pages
related to foot fetish.

949
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:46,750
Check for yourself.

950
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,333
But Vivaan…

951
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:52,791
If I like Deepika and
Katrina's Facebook pages,

952
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:54,583
it doesn't mean

953
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:57,083
I'll become a suspect
if someone stalks them.

954
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:58,726
- Come on, I think…
- Harsh, listen to me.

955
00:59:58,750 --> 00:59:59,833
Listen to me, Harsh!

956
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:02,333
I know it sounds a bit absurd

957
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:05,291
but I'm sure
we'll find a clue there.

958
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,041
- Vivaan.
- Listen to me.

959
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:12,916
Joshua came back from Mhapsa, Goa.

960
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:15,166
Exactly two months before
the first murder.

961
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,458
Later, we've had
a series of murders.

962
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:18,750
I know, Vivaan, but see…

963
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,583
- Just a minute, listen to me.
- See.

964
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:25,250
Nothing is common among all
the victims except this restaurant.

965
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:26,625
Right?

966
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:27,833
Right.

967
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,416
Yeah, right?

968
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:31,291
Check these comments.

969
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:37,333
Yes.

970
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,166
"You are seriously a freak.

971
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,500
Weirdo."

972
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,458
- Oh!
- Now look at this.

973
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,458
"What sort of a man is so
obsessed with women's feet?"

974
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:50,351
Tell me something,
do you know somebody…

975
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:52,666
Who is so obsessed
over women's feet?

976
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,333
I'm sure your answer is 'no', right?

977
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:57,375
I don't know.

978
01:00:57,666 --> 01:00:59,208
But I seriously doubt it.

979
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:01,833
I think
we're just wasting our time.

980
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:05,416
I know your doubts are
always backed by logic, but…

981
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,642
- This is a bit illogical.
- Just trust me on this one.

982
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:08,666
Just get the details.

983
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,125
Okay, can you do that?

984
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:14,500
Okay, sir.

985
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,791
You are the boss.

986
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,500
The nearby restaurant?

987
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:45,083
- The burgers are very famous, try them.
- Really?

988
01:01:45,208 --> 01:01:46,666
You go there regularly?

989
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:48,125
No, sir.

990
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,791
Why? Don't you like burgers?

991
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:52,958
No, sir, That's not true.

992
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:55,333
I used to go there
with my friends…

993
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:56,458
Hmm?

994
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,750
- The owner, Joshua…
- Yes?

995
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:00,708
He is our privileged customer.

996
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:03,416
- Joshua?
- Yes, he comes here regularly.

997
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:05,166
But…

998
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:07,458
But?

999
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:09,750
I stopped going there.

1000
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,458
He is a bit weird.

1001
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:15,250
Weird? How?

1002
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:21,166
Whenever he comes here
for a massage, he…

1003
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:24,666
He stares at my feet
in a weird way.

1004
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:26,208
In a bad way.

1005
01:02:27,291 --> 01:02:30,250
Once he even tried
touching my feet.

1006
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,916
Oh, my God!

1007
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,333
He is very strange and weird.

1008
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:37,125
Sir, can I say
something honestly?

1009
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:38,375
Yes?

1010
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:41,166
Sometimes I think
he is the Foot Fairy.

1011
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,125
No, sir, seriously.

1012
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:46,958
I didn't think of it at first.

1013
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:49,458
I've thought about it now.

1014
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:51,625
Whenever there is a murder,

1015
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:54,083
he disappears for
the next three to four days.

1016
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:56,333
How can you be so sure?

1017
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:58,625
Because for those
three to four days,

1018
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,208
he neither comes here
nor is he at the restaurant.

1019
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:03,291
He must be working from home.

1020
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,708
He must be busy or something.

1021
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:06,583
It doesn't mean that…

1022
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:07,750
No, sir.

1023
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:09,291
I have a friend

1024
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:11,458
who works at his restaurant.

1025
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,208
He's my neighbor.

1026
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:15,875
Sometimes we go home together.

1027
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:19,875
Once I just asked him casually.

1028
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:21,403
- Oh!
- I didn't ask him directly.

1029
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,541
I wanted some information
about Joshua.

1030
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,166
He told me his boss isn't home.

1031
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:28,041
That he is out of station.

1032
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:29,708
Out of station.

1033
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:31,458
Isn't it weird, sir?

1034
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:39,583
It is weird.

1035
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,666
- Vivaan.
- Yes.

1036
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,875
The girl from
the foot spa was right.

1037
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:54,208
The building watchman couldn't
confirm the date, but he was

1038
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:57,333
sure that our guy goes away
for three to four days.

1039
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,958
It has happened for three-four
times during these murders.

1040
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:01,416
Interesting.

1041
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:02,875
Sir.

1042
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:07,208
I tried to get some information
about him from Mhapsa.

1043
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,250
And sir, you won't
believe what I found.

1044
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:10,333
What?

1045
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:12,541
They found two dead girls
within a month.

1046
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,500
And both had their legs missing.

1047
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:17,333
Sir.

1048
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:23,166
But was Joshua there
when these murders took place?

1049
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:25,625
I am not sure
whether he was there

1050
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:27,041
at the time of both the murders.

1051
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:30,041
The second girl was fished out
of the lake behind the church

1052
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:32,500
and Joshua left only a week ago
from there.

1053
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:34,375
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

1054
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:37,208
I called Mhapsa Police Station
to get some information.

1055
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,083
Strangely, they recognized
Joshua right away.

1056
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:42,125
He had a girlfriend
named Priya Mihre.

1057
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:45,291
They'd often fight
and she'd call the police.

1058
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:47,583
In fact, sir, on 21st Jan

1059
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:50,041
a complaint was registered
against him.

1060
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,166
Sir.

1061
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:53,333
One second.

1062
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:54,416
Good job.

1063
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:55,458
Good.

1064
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:57,541
<i>Hello.
Yes.</i>

1065
01:04:57,958 --> 01:04:59,718
- Yes.
- Do you have his girlfriend's number?

1066
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:00,833
Yes, sir.

1067
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:02,250
Over here.

1068
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:04,958
Good job, Rishabh.
Well done.

1069
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,041
Thank you, sir.

1070
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:20,666
<i>Hello.</i>

1071
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,416
- Hello, Ms. Priya Mihre.
- Yeah?

1072
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:25,750
This is Vivaan Deshmukh,
from CBI, Mumbai.

1073
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:28,875
We need some information
about a man.

1074
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,833
We found out
that you know him socially.

1075
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:33,916
Who?

1076
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,333
Joshua Matthews.

1077
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:39,583
It would help us a lot
if you cooperate with us.

1078
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,541
Something wrong with him?

1079
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:42,958
Aren't you in touch with him?

1080
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:46,458
Mr Deshmukh, right?

1081
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:47,541
Yes.

1082
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:50,541
Forget about me, I say no one
should stay in touch with him.

1083
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:51,875
But…

1084
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:53,458
I don't get it.

1085
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:54,458
What happened?

1086
01:05:54,541 --> 01:05:57,291
I don't know if you are
following the news or not,

1087
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:59,750
but a serial killer is on a rampage
in Mumbai.

1088
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:01,916
And Joshua is a suspect?

1089
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,125
What do you think?

1090
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:07,083
If he is a suspect,
I won't be surprised.

1091
01:06:07,875 --> 01:06:09,916
<i>But how can I help you?</i>

1092
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:12,125
I just need some basic information.

1093
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:16,375
You must know about his foot obsession…
Foot fetish, right?

1094
01:06:16,916 --> 01:06:18,125
It's true.

1095
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,750
He is a freak.

1096
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:20,791
<i>He is not normal.</i>

1097
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,083
I'm so glad I left him.

1098
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:27,333
Ms. Priya, was he ever
abusive with you… physically?

1099
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:30,166
Yes, Mr. Deshmukh,
a lot of times.

1100
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:33,291
In fact, you won't believe it.
The last time I met him,

1101
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:35,333
he slapped me so hard

1102
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:36,875
that I fainted.

1103
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:38,000
And that was it.

1104
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,625
I went to the police station,

1105
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:42,041
filed a complaint and left him.

1106
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,250
Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.

1107
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:48,000
Anything else that can
be helpful for us?

1108
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:50,666
Something weird or dangerous?

1109
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,625
There's something

1110
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:57,000
that I have shared with
a very few people.

1111
01:06:58,041 --> 01:06:59,333
<i>But it has happened to me twice.</i>

1112
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:02,541
It's not normal.
Weird and scary.

1113
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,416
What is it?

1114
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:09,750
He tried to suffocate me.

1115
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:11,208
Suffocate?

1116
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:16,000
He covered my face with a pillow
while we were laughing.

1117
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:19,666
<i>And he started pressing
it hard, like really hard.</i>

1118
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,666
After a point, I couldn't breath.

1119
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:27,000
<i>I started screaming and
retaliating physically.</i>

1120
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,416
And only after a point,

1121
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:30,666
<i>He took the pillow away.</i>

1122
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:36,666
Didn't you ask him
why he did so?

1123
01:07:36,833 --> 01:07:39,166
<i>I did ask him,
but he started laughing out loud.</i>

1124
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,333
He said it was his childhood game.

1125
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:45,791
But trust me, Mr. Deshmukh.

1126
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,815
<i>This is not a childhood
game for him.</i>

1127
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:51,000
I could feel him enjoying
suffocating me.

1128
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:54,250
Ms. Priya, may I ask you
a direct question?

1129
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:55,833
Yes.

1130
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:58,875
As much as you know him,
do you think

1131
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,166
can Joshua murder someone?

1132
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,125
Oh yes, Mr. Deshmukh.

1133
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,750
For sure.

1134
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,258
Thank you, Ms. Priya.
Thank you for your help.

1135
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:16,957
Okay, tell me.

1136
01:08:17,875 --> 01:08:19,957
Is "Feets" a word?

1137
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:21,541
Ha, ha, very funny.

1138
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:28,250
Yes, ma'am, it's ready.

1139
01:08:29,832 --> 01:08:32,000
Oh!
Smells good.

1140
01:08:32,082 --> 01:08:35,957
Vivaan's tasty and delicious
instant noodles with chopsticks.

1141
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:38,625
Enjoy!

1142
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:40,916
Thank you.

1143
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:44,416
By the way…

1144
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,666
I got a call from my dad.

1145
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:46,750
I see.

1146
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:48,541
We talked about you.

1147
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,125
What did you talk about?

1148
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:52,750
That you're handling
the Foot Fairy case.

1149
01:08:52,832 --> 01:08:54,000
You're heading a team.

1150
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:56,832
And?

1151
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:00,082
And that, you are not
a typical civilian.

1152
01:09:00,207 --> 01:09:01,082
Yes.

1153
01:09:01,166 --> 01:09:04,125
You too have professional ethics
and codes like the military people.

1154
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:06,582
Yes, ma'am.
Professional ethics and codes.

1155
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:11,707
But today, I am going to break
my professional codes and ethics.

1156
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:13,541
Because you deserve to know.

1157
01:09:14,332 --> 01:09:17,375
We got our first break
and the credit goes to you.

1158
01:09:18,166 --> 01:09:19,166
Okay.

1159
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:21,332
I didn't get you.

1160
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:23,541
Your friend.

1161
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:25,250
- Yes?
- That restaurant.

1162
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,000
Its owner.

1163
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:28,332
His weirdness.

1164
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,041
Wait…

1165
01:09:31,457 --> 01:09:32,832
My friend, Aditi.

1166
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,541
And the owner? Joshua?

1167
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:38,000
Are you serious?

1168
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:40,291
I mean, is he your suspect or…

1169
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:43,750
Okay, fine.
You can't tell me, but…

1170
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:45,666
Seriously?

1171
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,416
This is really screwed up.

1172
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:50,166
Why screwed up?

1173
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:54,207
I mean, you are not telling me now.

1174
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:57,625
Guessing from your calculations,
he is your suspect, right?

1175
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:00,375
What if later they prove him innocent?

1176
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:03,791
I will feel guilty.

1177
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:06,416
You can't suspect a poor man
because I said…

1178
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Why are you laughing?

1179
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:10,833
You are taking it too far.

1180
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:13,500
I put this idea into your head.

1181
01:10:13,916 --> 01:10:14,916
Okay.

1182
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:18,250
Firstly, I don't believe in gossip.

1183
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,791
I've cross-checked everything.

1184
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:22,208
And secondly, my team
member Rishabh

1185
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:25,000
had already pointed this out.

1186
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:28,166
So, please enjoy Vivaan
special, yummy, tasty

1187
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:32,250
dish and don't give yourself
all the credit.

1188
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:33,625
So it's credit?

1189
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:34,666
Okay.

1190
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:37,916
One second.

1191
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:44,958
Hi.

1192
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,375
- Hi.
- What's this?

1193
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:49,166
Grandma has prepared
carrot pudding for you.

1194
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:51,416
This is Devika.

1195
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,083
And this is Richa.

1196
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,583
- Hello.
- Hi.

1197
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:58,625
Is she the same Richa
you often talk about?

1198
01:10:58,708 --> 01:10:59,625
Yes, she is the one

1199
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:02,791
whose college is just opposite
the famous <i>vadapav </i>joint…

1200
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:03,958
The same…

1201
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Very funny!

1202
01:11:06,125 --> 01:11:09,916
Your grandma didn't find me a cook,
so I made Vivaan special.

1203
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:11,875
Would you like to try some?

1204
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:14,875
Sorry, actually I need to
complete my homework.

1205
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:16,166
Okay.

1206
01:11:16,416 --> 01:11:18,125
- Bye. Nice meeting you.
- Bye.

1207
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,041
She is so cute.

1208
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:21,333
Isn't she?

1209
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,708
These are Joshua's phone records.

1210
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:33,601
His phone was switched off at
the time of the first and fourth murder.

1211
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:37,291
He was near the spot where the second,
third, and the fifth murder took place.

1212
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:39,833
Within the radius of more than
half a mile.

1213
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,791
And you still think he is clean?

1214
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,541
Not exactly, but it could
also be circumstantial.

1215
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:51,166
Look, you're right to point out

1216
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,083
that he had some connection with…

1217
01:11:53,166 --> 01:11:54,333
Harsh, I'm telling you.

1218
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:57,416
Whatever clues we've found so far
can't be coincidental.

1219
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,708
I like this guy.

1220
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:00,875
He is our prime suspect.

1221
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:12,541
<i>He's a bit weird.</i>

1222
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,708
<i>They found two dead girls within a month.</i>

1223
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:17,041
<i>Both the girls had
their feet missing.</i>

1224
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:18,666
<i>…he tried to suffocate me.</i>

1225
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,291
<i>He's the first man I know</i>

1226
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:22,291
<i>who looks only at a girl's feet.</i>

1227
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:24,559
<i>His phone was switched off at the time
of the first and fourth murder.</i>

1228
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:27,666
<i>He was near the spot where the second,
third, fifth murder took place.</i>

1229
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,310
<i>It's not just a childhood game for him.</i>

1230
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:30,791
I could feel him…

1231
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:33,625
<i>Sometimes I think
he is the Foot Fairy.</i>

1232
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:35,083
<i>He is obsessed with…</i>

1233
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:37,458
<i>Two girls were killed within a month.</i>

1234
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:52,833
No, Vivaan.

1235
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:54,833
How can you expect me

1236
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:57,833
to issue a search warrant
based on these proofs?

1237
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,916
The magistrate will file
a case against me.

1238
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:02,375
And you very well know.

1239
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:04,041
These are not even circumstantial.

1240
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:06,291
Could you find only him
in the entire city

1241
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:08,208
who has no previous record?

1242
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:10,208
Sir, you know how unusual
this case is.

1243
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:11,791
The suspects will
also be unusual.

1244
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,059
I have a very strong feeling
about this man, so if you…

1245
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,625
- Vivaan!
- Please trust me on…

1246
01:13:16,791 --> 01:13:17,833
I'm not against you.

1247
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:20,125
Think about it
from my point of view.

1248
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:23,833
There is a panic in Mumbai,
everyone is questioning me.

1249
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,791
And I have no answers.

1250
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:29,500
Now you want me to let you pursue
this lead on that basis?

1251
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:31,583
You get something more.

1252
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:34,291
I will try my best
to get you a warrant.

1253
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,000
Saleem Sir is right.

1254
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:44,791
We need something substantial.

1255
01:13:45,875 --> 01:13:48,250
Or else the media will roast us
even before the court.

1256
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:50,583
But what are we supposed to find?

1257
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:53,250
I mean, we have no direction.

1258
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:56,916
We saw so many
possibilities with this suspect.

1259
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:59,000
The rest were dismissed…

1260
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:01,208
Hello.

1261
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:02,875
Sure?

1262
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,583
Okay.

1263
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:09,541
Our burger boy is back in town.

1264
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:12,083
He is at his restaurant right now.

1265
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Come on.

1266
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,916
Let's say hello
to the Foot Fairy.

1267
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,875
Sorry, sir. We're shut for the day.

1268
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,458
Joshua Mathews.

1269
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,666
Actually…

1270
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:41,166
Mr Joshua…

1271
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:07,541
She is the one.

1272
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,666
"Cappuccino with extra cream,
it's not hot enough."

1273
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,333
She complains all the time.

1274
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,750
I've seen her here too.

1275
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:23,083
These three…

1276
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,000
No, I don't remember.

1277
01:15:26,708 --> 01:15:28,208
Are you sure, Mr. Joshua?

1278
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:29,708
Of course, I am sure.

1279
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:32,416
These victims
visited your restaurant

1280
01:15:33,041 --> 01:15:36,916
almost a week before
they were murdered.

1281
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:39,375
Isn't that strange?

1282
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:41,333
Strange? I don't know.

1283
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,625
Maybe, coincidence
is the right word.

1284
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,083
Coincidence!

1285
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:51,125
I like this word, coincidence.

1286
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:53,083
Do you know,

1287
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,166
two such cases coincidentally,

1288
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:57,958
happened even in Mhapsa
when you were there?

1289
01:15:58,916 --> 01:15:59,958
Coincidence?

1290
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:05,583
Hold on.

1291
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,333
I hope you are not assuming that…

1292
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,541
I am the Foot Fairy.

1293
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:15,750
I'm sorry.

1294
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:17,791
I always imagined

1295
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:19,875
that to become a CBI officer,

1296
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:22,833
you need to be intelligent,
have a high IQ, but…

1297
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:25,083
I guess I was wrong.

1298
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,791
We have information

1299
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,500
that you have a weird
kind of foot fetish.

1300
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:34,125
- Oh God!
- Would you like to elaborate?

1301
01:16:35,375 --> 01:16:38,500
If taking extra care of one's feet
is called as fetish…

1302
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:41,208
Look, I think that…

1303
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:45,083
Out of all the body parts
in a girl,

1304
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:47,083
her feet is the most beautiful.

1305
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:52,291
If you want to call it a weird
kind of fetish, so…

1306
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,416
Yes, I have a foot fetish.

1307
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,375
Look at these dates.

1308
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:03,833
Where were you on these dates?

1309
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:08,500
I don't eat almonds,
so my memory is not that strong.

1310
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:12,000
Give me a day,
I'll give details for each day.

1311
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:15,458
What about those three-four days
when you suddenly disappear?

1312
01:17:16,916 --> 01:17:18,500
That's none of your business.

1313
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:21,250
Tell the truth.

1314
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:23,375
Or else it will be my business.
You understand?

1315
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,375
I go for trekking.

1316
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:31,875
Why? To destroy all the evidence?

1317
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,541
I… I think you're crossing
the line here. Okay?

1318
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,000
Crossing the line?

1319
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,750
Is this crossing the line?

1320
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:47,000
Please… Please don't do this.
Please stop this.

1321
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:49,059
- Please stop it. Please…
- Is this crossing the line?

1322
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:51,416
I'm warning… Oh, God!

1323
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,458
Do you remember this?

1324
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:54,916
This… Please take it away.

1325
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,559
- Move it, please…
- And this, look here.

1326
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:59,041
- Take a look. It's your masterpiece.
- Please stop it.

1327
01:17:59,666 --> 01:18:00,666
Please stop it!

1328
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:02,958
- Hey, look over here. What's wrong?
- Stop it.

1329
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:04,642
- It's time for you to leave.
- Are you not enjoying now?

1330
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:06,642
- Please stop it.
- All these are your masterpieces.

1331
01:18:06,666 --> 01:18:08,809
- You only enjoy while killing them?
- Move this away from me.

1332
01:18:08,833 --> 01:18:11,875
- How do you choose your victims?
- Take it away.

1333
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:13,142
- You look at their feet, right?
- Please stop it.

1334
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:14,958
- You must get a sexual high…
- Stop it!

1335
01:18:15,083 --> 01:18:17,291
- …when they struggle to breathe…
- Just shut up!

1336
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:20,458
- Shut up!
- And this is your final trophy!

1337
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:23,208
- You saw off their legs and then…
- Stop it!

1338
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:25,291
- Vivaan…
- Mother…

1339
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,142
Are you out of your mind?
You want to hit me?

1340
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:28,666
Hit me if you want to!

1341
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:30,041
Then see what happens…

1342
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,333
I am not a poor man!

1343
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:35,500
First, find out who I am.

1344
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,208
And then come and see me.

1345
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:39,476
Before that, don't you dare
enter my property again.

1346
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,000
- Okay…
- Please leave right now!

1347
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,083
- Right now!
- Vivaan, relax.

1348
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:44,416
Please come.

1349
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:45,833
Come.

1350
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:47,750
What the hell!

1351
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:11,958
You should've let me
punch the bastard!

1352
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:14,083
Punch the bastard!

1353
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,541
I should also
let him sue you, right?

1354
01:19:20,625 --> 01:19:22,291
We were in his restaurant.

1355
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:24,791
And that too, without a warrant.

1356
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,041
Do you remember
what did Mr. Saleem say?

1357
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:29,458
One mistake,
and it will be over.

1358
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:31,750
Didn't you see how he reacted?

1359
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,875
He is guilty and that's why…

1360
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,041
In fact, most get scared
when they see us.

1361
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:38,833
Maybe you are right.

1362
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:42,791
But only our suspicion
can't send him behind bars.

1363
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:44,791
You get it, don't you?

1364
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:48,750
We set up a trap to catch

1365
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,000
an officer
accepting bribe, don't we?

1366
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:52,791
- Right?
- Right.

1367
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:54,000
So?

1368
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:56,541
Then let's set up a trap.

1369
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,916
How is that?

1370
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,791
We'll let loose a target
for the hunter.

1371
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:04,083
Who will be the prey?

1372
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:08,375
There is someone.

1373
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,666
You'll only do what I have
told you to, okay?

1374
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:19,666
Don't worry,
I am here with my entire team.

1375
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:22,291
We'll watch you
and you won't be harmed.

1376
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:24,791
Like I promised,
you will also get 50,000.

1377
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:26,750
I'll also help your brother
get a job

1378
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:28,513
with the Manipur Police.
I'll talk to them.

1379
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Shakhin…

1380
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:33,333
Don't you want the Foot Fairy
to be caught?

1381
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:36,791
What if someone dear to you
ends up in his suitcase tomorrow?

1382
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,166
How will you feel then?

1383
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,958
We need to display some courage.

1384
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:41,583
Come on, let's get this bastard.

1385
01:20:41,791 --> 01:20:44,166
But sir, why would he attack me?

1386
01:20:45,125 --> 01:20:47,125
He could've done that already
if he wanted to.

1387
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:49,250
You don't travel by train,
that's why.

1388
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:51,125
He knows you go home by bus.

1389
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:53,541
He attacks only near the station.

1390
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:55,000
Shakhin, listen…

1391
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:56,208
Don't worry.

1392
01:20:56,291 --> 01:20:57,291
You'll be fine.

1393
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:59,208
Just do

1394
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:01,458
whatever I've told you to.
Follow my instructions.

1395
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:03,583
Trust me, okay?

1396
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:32,041
- Hi.
- Hi.

1397
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:33,875
- You placed your order?
- Yeah.

1398
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,805
- What are you getting, a burger?
- Burger.

1399
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:38,000
I'll send you a kitsch.
It's really good today.

1400
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:40,833
Hey, hi, Shakhin.

1401
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:44,291
- Hello. Good, good.
- How are you?

1402
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:46,041
- How are you?
- I'm perfectly fine.

1403
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:47,934
You didn't visit the spa
for a long time. Not in the city?

1404
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:50,166
<i>I was busy with some work.
I'll come tomorrow.</i>

1405
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,250
Okay.

1406
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:53,916
Hey! That is a lovely anklet.

1407
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,017
- Oh! Thank you.
- <i>Very pretty! Where did you buy it from?</i>

1408
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:57,958
- This one? From Midnight Flea Market.
- Okay.

1409
01:21:58,041 --> 01:21:59,208
Ma'am, here's your order.

1410
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:00,666
Thank you.

1411
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:02,333
Okay, then see you.

1412
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,250
- Bye.
- Bye.

1413
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:05,666
- You live in Bandra East, don't you?
<i>- Yes.</i>

1414
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:07,333
<i>I'm on my way to Goregaon.</i>

1415
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:08,416
<i>Okay.</i>

1416
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:10,208
To see a friend.

1417
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:12,125
She will pick me from the station.

1418
01:22:12,208 --> 01:22:13,375
- Traveling by train?
- Yes.

1419
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:14,958
<i>- Alone?
- Yes.</i>

1420
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,000
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Okay.

1421
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:18,125
- See you.
- Bye.

1422
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:21,416
Be careful.

1423
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:22,833
Yeah.

1424
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:35,208
Very good, Shakhin, very good.

1425
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:38,250
Don't be afraid.
We are right behind you. Okay?

1426
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:40,791
- Okay.
- Just stick to the plan.

1427
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:42,416
Okay.

1428
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:48,000
Rishabh, be ready.

1429
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,541
- We have already left.
- <i>Okay, sir.</i>

1430
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:52,083
- Is Hari at the exit?
- Yes.

1431
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,125
<i>Sir, he is leaving.</i>

1432
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:06,250
No one follows.

1433
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:08,875
I repeat, no one follows. Okay?

1434
01:23:09,291 --> 01:23:10,833
Let's get this bastard.

1435
01:23:48,291 --> 01:23:49,625
Remember, be normal.

1436
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,791
And get off at
Goregaon Station. Okay?

1437
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:53,083
<i>Goregaon Station.</i>

1438
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:25,791
Keep walking. Maybe he is
watching you and act normal.

1439
01:24:25,875 --> 01:24:28,041
Stick to the route
I've told you about.

1440
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:29,791
<i>Don't worry,
I am watching you. Okay?</i>

1441
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:30,875
Okay.

1442
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:34,833
I'm right behind you. Okay?

1443
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,541
Shakhin, okay?

1444
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:08,041
Shakhin…

1445
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:16,875
Shakhin, okay?

1446
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:21,208
Shit!

1447
01:25:27,166 --> 01:25:28,541
<i>Shakhin is with us.</i>

1448
01:25:28,625 --> 01:25:29,958
- Vivaan.
- Yes?

1449
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:31,875
Shakhin is at the exit point.

1450
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:33,083
With Hari and Rishabh.

1451
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:34,208
She is fine.

1452
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:38,000
Come.

1453
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:47,333
What's the next move?

1454
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:48,708
He never came.

1455
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:50,291
I don't know.

1456
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:54,291
I don't know.
He must have suspected something.

1457
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:57,333
Did anyone follow her?

1458
01:25:57,625 --> 01:25:58,625
No.

1459
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:06,541
Drop her home and keep a watch.

1460
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,548
I don't want that bastard
getting to her. Okay?

1461
01:26:09,041 --> 01:26:10,041
Okay.

1462
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:17,875
Hari, drop her home.

1463
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,708
I told you, you'd be fine.

1464
01:26:24,166 --> 01:26:25,791
Not today, but later…

1465
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:27,041
You'll be fine.

1466
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:28,583
Now, you're under state protection.

1467
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Okay?

1468
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:32,750
I will send the cash home.

1469
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:36,125
I'll also put in a word
for your brother's job.

1470
01:26:38,708 --> 01:26:39,708
Shakhin…

1471
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:41,208
Don't worry.

1472
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:43,166
Okay?

1473
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:49,916
Devika!

1474
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:06,000
Vivaan!

1475
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:09,833
What happened?

1476
01:29:12,208 --> 01:29:13,666
Why weren't you
answering your phone?

1477
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:16,041
The neighbor's son suddenly
started vomiting…

1478
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:18,041
But what happened?

1479
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,208
What is it?

1480
01:29:21,791 --> 01:29:23,083
I was so worried.

1481
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,000
Vivaan, are you okay?

1482
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:32,375
Am I looking fat here?

1483
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,000
It's a really unique idea
to scare me.

1484
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,250
Very good.

1485
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:41,333
But you can't get rid of me
so easily.

1486
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,208
I wish, it was my idea.

1487
01:29:44,708 --> 01:29:45,750
But it's not.

1488
01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:49,250
Chill, Vivaan.

1489
01:29:49,583 --> 01:29:52,416
Maybe a journalist
pulled this prank on you.

1490
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:56,375
You don't give them an interview
or any information.

1491
01:29:56,708 --> 01:29:59,041
You never know, this must be
their way of pissing you off.

1492
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:03,291
And, I am not scared of
that perv Joshua.

1493
01:30:04,958 --> 01:30:05,958
Okay?

1494
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:08,625
Okay.

1495
01:30:09,791 --> 01:30:10,791
Good.

1496
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:16,125
Maybe the other day
he went to your home

1497
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:17,976
and so he didn't
show up at the station.

1498
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:20,583
I don't know. My brain
has stopped working.

1499
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,666
Hari tracked him that night
after the raid.

1500
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:24,333
Joshua was in his house.

1501
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,791
He didn't leave the house
even for a second.

1502
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:28,083
Where is he now?

1503
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:29,833
At the restaurant.

1504
01:30:30,708 --> 01:30:32,708
Did you send those photographs
to the lab?

1505
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:34,083
Rishabh has sent them.

1506
01:30:34,166 --> 01:30:36,291
But I doubt if we'll find
any prints.

1507
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:47,958
Vivaan…

1508
01:30:48,125 --> 01:30:49,250
A college student is here.

1509
01:30:49,333 --> 01:30:51,750
He says he might've seen
the Foot Fairy.

1510
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:55,166
Come.

1511
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:58,750
Face?

1512
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:01,916
I couldn't see his face clearly.

1513
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,166
He had put on a cap…

1514
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,708
The hood of his sweatshirt
covered the cap, so…

1515
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:09,791
Why do you think
he could be the Foot Fairy?

1516
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:12,916
Because you said,

1517
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,625
he wore khaki pants
and white sneakers.

1518
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,500
That's what he was wearing.

1519
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:20,333
I even saw him getting out
of the station.

1520
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,041
- And…
- And?

1521
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,750
As he passed by me,

1522
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:30,750
I spotted surgical
gloves in his back pocket.

1523
01:31:32,333 --> 01:31:34,125
The fingertips were sticking out.

1524
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:35,750
The color of the gloves?

1525
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:37,291
Black.

1526
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:42,708
San deep.

1527
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,125
Out of these five, who could be
the one you saw?

1528
01:31:47,291 --> 01:31:48,375
Take your time.

1529
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,500
Sir, this man.

1530
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:05,208
Sure?

1531
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,500
Well…

1532
01:32:09,916 --> 01:32:10,916
Sir…

1533
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:14,416
It could also be him.

1534
01:32:15,166 --> 01:32:17,833
I mean, one of these two.

1535
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:20,458
Both look similar.

1536
01:32:23,458 --> 01:32:24,916
It could be any of these two.

1537
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:37,041
And what about the other man?

1538
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:39,250
He has been in Thane Jail
for a year, sir.

1539
01:32:39,416 --> 01:32:40,458
- Okay.
- Yes.

1540
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:43,208
So it's enough to order
a search warrant and DNA analysis.

1541
01:32:43,291 --> 01:32:44,291
Yes, sir.

1542
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:46,083
Want to interrogate him?

1543
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:48,708
No, sir. There's no point.
He is too smart and won't confess.

1544
01:32:49,833 --> 01:32:50,953
Whatever you think is right.

1545
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:52,541
But remember one thing, Vivaan.

1546
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:54,333
We need evidence

1547
01:32:54,416 --> 01:32:57,291
with which we can connect this man
directly to all the murders.

1548
01:32:57,458 --> 01:32:58,583
Yes, sir. I know…

1549
01:32:58,791 --> 01:33:01,000
I'll find something,
a murder weapon or something

1550
01:33:01,083 --> 01:33:02,625
that links him
to the murder directly.

1551
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:04,666
I will… For sure.

1552
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:32,250
I can't give you more time, Vivaan.

1553
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:35,458
Joshua's lawyer can sue us
for defamation.

1554
01:35:35,791 --> 01:35:38,500
And then, you know
the media will tear us apart.

1555
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:41,750
Give up on him,
look for other suspects.

1556
01:35:44,458 --> 01:35:45,708
One second.

1557
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:48,375
Yeah.

1558
01:35:51,416 --> 01:35:52,416
Okay, thanks.

1559
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:56,291
That was the lab.

1560
01:35:56,791 --> 01:36:00,083
The inscription on the body
doesn't match with Joshua's handwriting.

1561
01:36:00,916 --> 01:36:01,916
One more thing.

1562
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,416
The Foot Fairy is right-handed
and Joshua is left-handed.

1563
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:06,125
Many people are ambidextrous.

1564
01:36:06,208 --> 01:36:07,291
Shut up!

1565
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,083
<i>Can I ask you something?</i>

1566
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:17,208
You were never that passionate
about any other suspect.

1567
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:19,250
Only Joshua.

1568
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:21,041
Why?

1569
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:24,083
You really think
he is the Foot Fairy?

1570
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:26,625
Or you want him to be?

1571
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:29,416
Just to feel less stressful?

1572
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:33,750
You know…

1573
01:36:34,291 --> 01:36:35,833
More than any research,

1574
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:38,208
I trust my gut feeling.

1575
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:42,250
It tells me
Joshua is the Foot Fairy.

1576
01:36:43,291 --> 01:36:45,208
I can't explain,

1577
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:47,916
but I find something strange
in his eyes

1578
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:49,750
that I can't describe.

1579
01:36:50,333 --> 01:36:53,000
Once I understand that…

1580
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:54,916
Then…

1581
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:58,000
And God forbid,

1582
01:36:58,208 --> 01:36:59,708
What if you are wrong?

1583
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:01,416
There's no chance.

1584
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:03,583
I am sure it's him.

1585
01:37:04,416 --> 01:37:06,916
I will have that bastard
in custody before…

1586
01:37:10,125 --> 01:37:11,666
Before he harms me?

1587
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:17,916
Don't you worry,
Mr. Vivaan Deshmukh.

1588
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,041
And don't forget,
I am an Army child.

1589
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,500
See these manicured nails?

1590
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:25,875
If that perv comes any closer,

1591
01:37:27,291 --> 01:37:29,208
I will scratch his face off!

1592
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:31,625
Got it?

1593
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:34,375
Got it.

1594
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:35,500
Good.

1595
01:37:36,375 --> 01:37:37,375
Now, smile.

1596
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:43,333
Coffee?

1597
01:37:46,541 --> 01:37:49,708
Should we talk to Mr. Saleem about
police protection for Devika?

1598
01:37:50,541 --> 01:37:52,916
No, you know she wouldn't agree.

1599
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:55,958
We spoke yesterday.

1600
01:37:56,041 --> 01:37:58,458
She says if she sees that joker
anywhere around her…

1601
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:00,708
She will scratch his…

1602
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:03,041
What happened?

1603
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:04,541
Vivaan!

1604
01:38:05,541 --> 01:38:06,958
Will you tell me what's wrong?

1605
01:38:09,958 --> 01:38:12,291
When we raided Joshua's house,

1606
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,000
he was in his boxer shorts.

1607
01:38:14,208 --> 01:38:15,875
- So?
- There were scratches on his hands.

1608
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:17,500
I'm sure, they're nail scratches.

1609
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:19,517
The victim would have scratched
him in self–defense.

1610
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:21,250
Yes, but we have already checked.

1611
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:23,208
Nothing was found
under any of the nails.

1612
01:38:23,291 --> 01:38:26,000
And the victims who were
handled by the cops before us?

1613
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:27,958
The second victim Seema Bimal…

1614
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:30,166
There's nothing about her nails
in the report.

1615
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:31,666
Maybe she scratched him?

1616
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:33,333
Maybe she didn't.

1617
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:35,625
That's why there is no mention
of it in the report.

1618
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:37,666
But still, it's a protocol, Harsh.

1619
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:39,666
What if this is the mistake
we have made?

1620
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:41,708
Yes. Dr. Bhogle…

1621
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:44,083
I'd like some information
about a case.

1622
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:49,750
Did the lab confirm
that there could be a lapse?

1623
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:51,166
Yes, sir and that's why

1624
01:38:51,375 --> 01:38:53,833
we need to exhume the body
to test it again.

1625
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:55,541
Sir…

1626
01:38:55,791 --> 01:38:56,916
Sir, please…

1627
01:38:57,125 --> 01:38:59,500
I really need this to catch him.

1628
01:39:00,416 --> 01:39:01,416
Need?

1629
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:03,583
No, Vivaan.

1630
01:39:04,083 --> 01:39:05,166
You don't need this.

1631
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:06,916
You want this.

1632
01:39:25,708 --> 01:39:27,642
Final DNA results will be
ready by the day after tomorrow.

1633
01:39:27,666 --> 01:39:28,666
Yes, sir.

1634
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:31,750
If Joshua's skin tissues match
with those found under the nails…

1635
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:33,916
No ifs and buts, they will match.

1636
01:39:34,166 --> 01:39:35,041
Okay.

1637
01:39:35,166 --> 01:39:36,851
He's under bumper lock surveillance,
isn't he?

1638
01:39:36,875 --> 01:39:39,083
Yes. I've also sent
a restraining order.

1639
01:39:39,291 --> 01:39:41,708
He can't leave Mumbai
till the results are out.

1640
01:39:42,291 --> 01:39:43,291
Good.

1641
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:44,333
Mr Saleem…

1642
01:39:46,166 --> 01:39:47,333
Thanks for trusting me.

1643
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:07,583
Let me ask Hari.

1644
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:14,041
- Hari…
- Yes, sir?

1645
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:15,333
What's the status?

1646
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,083
He is at home, sir.

1647
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:19,666
Okay.

1648
01:40:34,916 --> 01:40:37,267
What happened at the office?
You're wearing a new shirt today?

1649
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:38,375
Sir, don't make fun of me…

1650
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:39,666
You're looking handsome today.

1651
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:40,750
I am here…

1652
01:41:01,041 --> 01:41:02,291
Hello. Yeah, Rishabh?

1653
01:41:22,416 --> 01:41:23,416
Sir.

1654
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,333
The railway police had called.

1655
01:41:26,208 --> 01:41:27,208
Sir, gloves…

1656
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:23,666
Sir!

1657
01:42:24,583 --> 01:42:25,583
Sir!

1658
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:34,541
Yes, Rishabh.

1659
01:43:05,416 --> 01:43:06,583
Shit!

1660
01:44:02,833 --> 01:44:04,333
She was only 15.

1661
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:08,875
Why her? It's not your pattern.

1662
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:12,416
You did it only to exact
revenge upon me, right?

1663
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:16,958
I am going to kill you,
you bastard!

1664
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:20,291
You know what?

1665
01:44:21,458 --> 01:44:24,166
It will make no difference to
anyone if you die.

1666
01:44:35,375 --> 01:44:36,833
Tell me. Didn't you kill her?

1667
01:44:37,916 --> 01:44:40,291
Tell me the truth.
Didn't you kill her?

1668
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:45,708
Yes.

1669
01:44:47,416 --> 01:44:48,833
I killed her.

1670
01:44:50,291 --> 01:44:51,708
I killed them all.

1671
01:44:53,791 --> 01:44:55,041
All those girls.

1672
01:44:58,041 --> 01:44:59,625
Is that what you want to hear?

1673
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:16,416
Stop!

1674
01:45:16,625 --> 01:45:17,666
Are you out of your mind?

1675
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:18,916
Control yourself.

1676
01:45:23,291 --> 01:45:25,083
Just watch what I do with you.

1677
01:45:25,333 --> 01:45:26,458
Arrest the bastard!

1678
01:45:28,166 --> 01:45:29,791
Harsh, arrest the bastard!

1679
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:35,291
DNA result.

1680
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:49,916
It's a mistake.

1681
01:45:50,791 --> 01:45:52,500
This report is wrong.
Get it checked again.

1682
01:45:54,125 --> 01:45:56,250
Vivaan, get a grip.

1683
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:01,625
Control yourself.

1684
01:46:42,208 --> 01:46:44,041
At least, the end was peaceful.

1685
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:46,583
I guess so.

1686
01:46:46,625 --> 01:46:48,333
<i>- Is the family okay?</i>
- Yes.

1687
01:46:50,291 --> 01:46:51,625
They're not in shock.

1688
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:52,625
I guess, they were expecting it.

1689
01:46:52,708 --> 01:46:54,291
They were prepared.

1690
01:46:58,166 --> 01:46:59,666
Anyway, say hi to Harsh.

1691
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:00,833
<i>Sure, I will.</i>

1692
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:03,458
Listen, I'll call you from
the airport. Okay?

1693
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:05,208
Okay. Safe flight.

1694
01:47:05,458 --> 01:47:06,458
Okay, bye.

1695
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,541
Bye.

1696
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:08,708
Bye.

1697
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:17,291
How is Bengaluru?

1698
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:19,642
Looks like, it's treating you well.

1699
01:47:19,666 --> 01:47:20,916
Not really.

1700
01:47:22,125 --> 01:47:24,250
How is your security company doing?

1701
01:47:24,333 --> 01:47:25,333
It's good.

1702
01:47:26,333 --> 01:47:27,973
You tell me. What's going on
in your life?

1703
01:47:28,625 --> 01:47:29,708
What about me?

1704
01:47:30,166 --> 01:47:31,375
It's the same.

1705
01:47:31,875 --> 01:47:33,333
Only the governments change.

1706
01:47:33,666 --> 01:47:35,166
Our work doesn't.

1707
01:47:35,833 --> 01:47:36,833
What about Rishabh?

1708
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:40,000
Russia. A special assignment.

1709
01:47:40,583 --> 01:47:41,583
Hmm.

1710
01:47:42,083 --> 01:47:43,375
And Joshua?

1711
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,083
Any news about Joshua?

1712
01:47:49,541 --> 01:47:50,583
I don't know.

1713
01:47:51,583 --> 01:47:52,583
He must be somewhere.

1714
01:47:54,541 --> 01:47:57,833
LSB has shut shop and a new joint
has taken its place.

1715
01:47:59,375 --> 01:48:00,500
I don't know the rest.

1716
01:48:03,458 --> 01:48:05,166
- Vivaan…
- Yes?

1717
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:08,500
I wanted to say something
for a long time.

1718
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:11,708
But I never got a chance.

1719
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:15,000
I could neither muster the courage
to tell you this.

1720
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:16,083
Tell me.

1721
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:20,500
I hope you didn't feel

1722
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:23,500
that I backed out
at the last minute.

1723
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,958
You know, when you resigned,

1724
01:48:28,208 --> 01:48:30,208
I should've resigned too.

1725
01:48:30,958 --> 01:48:32,416
Don't be stupid, Harsh.

1726
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:35,500
You know,
I didn't want to resign.

1727
01:48:35,791 --> 01:48:37,375
But I had no choice.

1728
01:48:39,041 --> 01:48:41,125
Joshua's defamation case.

1729
01:48:41,833 --> 01:48:44,541
Mr. Saleem had no option.

1730
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:47,500
Since I was
heading this investigation.

1731
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,166
It had to be me.

1732
01:48:52,541 --> 01:48:54,708
My only regret is…

1733
01:48:55,875 --> 01:48:57,541
That the case was closed.

1734
01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:07,041
Forget it.

1735
01:49:09,083 --> 01:49:10,625
- See you soon.
- Sure.

1736
01:49:49,666 --> 01:49:51,541
Please pull over to the left.

1737
01:50:17,875 --> 01:50:22,416
<i>The Foot Fairy Case will always
be a successful failure for me.</i>

1738
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:26,958
<i>Successful
because we stopped the killings.</i>

1739
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:31,750
<i>But a failure
because we couldn't catch him.</i>

1740
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:33,375
Mister!

1741
01:50:34,333 --> 01:50:35,375
What are you looking at?

1742
01:50:37,416 --> 01:50:39,583
Nothing, just looking.

1743
01:50:40,291 --> 01:50:41,291
You too?

1744
01:50:43,041 --> 01:50:44,041
What do you mean?

1745
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:48,125
Some time ago, a man like you
was standing here.

1746
01:50:48,583 --> 01:50:49,750
He was looking over there.

1747
01:50:49,833 --> 01:50:51,500
I asked him the same question.

1748
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,083
So what did he say?

1749
01:50:56,125 --> 01:50:57,333
He told me,

1750
01:50:57,541 --> 01:50:59,750
he had kept a red suitcase
over there.

1751
01:51:00,125 --> 01:51:02,583
Many years ago.
He came to check on that.

1752
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:11,083
Did you see his face?

1753
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,166
What did he look like?

1754
01:51:14,375 --> 01:51:17,458
Like you, like any other middle-aged man.

1755
01:51:18,166 --> 01:51:19,333
And where did he go?

1756
01:52:49,458 --> 01:52:55,833
<i>The darkness will creep up behind you
To sting.</i>

1757
01:52:58,333 --> 01:53:05,083
<i>Time will outrun you
The morning is still far away.</i>

1758
01:53:07,166 --> 01:53:14,000
<i>Only darkness shall stand by you
Till the end.</i>

1759
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:19,916
<i>Accidents lurk at every step.</i>

1760
01:53:20,333 --> 01:53:24,375
<i>Waiting to pounce on you.</i>

1761
01:53:24,708 --> 01:53:28,791
<i>They'll latch onto you.</i>

1762
01:53:29,125 --> 01:53:33,500
<i>Even if you try to get away.</i>

1763
01:53:38,125 --> 01:53:41,208
<i>Darkness!</i>

1764
01:53:42,708 --> 01:53:49,500
<i>Time will outrun you
The morning is still far away.</i>

1765
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,125
<i>See the blind vortex of dreams.</i>

1766
01:54:14,583 --> 01:54:18,750
<i>And the rising smoke
That pricks your eyes.</i>

1767
01:54:19,125 --> 01:54:22,625
<i>Everyone will be destroyed.</i>

1768
01:54:22,708 --> 01:54:26,958
<i>Oh this killer darkness!</i>

1769
01:54:27,083 --> 01:54:29,875
<i>At every step.</i>

1770
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
