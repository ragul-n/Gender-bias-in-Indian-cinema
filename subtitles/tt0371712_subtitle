1
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,037
Stop!

2
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:11,442
March ahead.

3
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:51,968
"Don't cast an evil eye on my beloved,
oh cloud."

4
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,752
"Don't cast an evil eye."

5
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:56,657
"Oh cloud,
don't cast an evil eye on her."

6
00:02:57,725 --> 00:03:00,319
"My beloved is sleeping."

7
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:03,049
"My beloved is sleeping."

8
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,846
"Don't make noise. Talk softly."

9
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,820
Give me the keys.
- I don't have them.

10
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,482
I know where it is.
It's tied to the sari of the lady.

11
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,563
Hey! Drag all the women of the
house by their hair and bring them here.

12
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:25,752
We can't do that.
- What?

13
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,157
How dare you argue with me?
Why can't you do it?

14
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:30,455
Everybody has short hair. Bob cut.

15
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:39,631
I hope you know that I don't
think twice before beheading someone.

16
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:43,009
Tell me where the keys
are or I'll kill you.

17
00:04:56,206 --> 00:04:57,223
Give me the spear.

18
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:08,672
It won't help.

19
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:12,055
Give me the stick.

20
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:22,434
Get the crowbar.

21
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:23,461
One..

22
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,575
How far have you proceeded?

23
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,068
I'll soon succeed.

24
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:29,938
You'll never.

25
00:06:30,997 --> 00:06:34,068
The money of the offering
made to the Goddess is still pending.

26
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:36,965
Why? I'm trying my
best to collect the money.

27
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,548
It's thirteen and half rupees.

28
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:42,446
I want to offer silver
leaves to the Goddess.

29
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:44,857
Please make one for me.

30
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,138
I'll give you the money before
Ashtami (eight day of Durga puja).

31
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:48,683
Wretched fellow.

32
00:06:48,763 --> 00:06:50,208
You managed thirteen
rupees after such a long time.

33
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:51,462
It's thirteen and half rupees.

34
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:53,894
I'll slap you hard, you wretched fellow.

35
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,397
How dare you act smart with me?

36
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:56,964
You are a cheat.

37
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:00,197
As if you are a honest man.

38
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:02,856
You sell impure silver.

39
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,856
I do the right thing.

40
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:07,656
I'm an artist.
- Me too.

41
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:10,003
No one in this district
has skills like me.

42
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,143
I'll pick their pockets
and they won't even find out.

43
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:15,527
I know what you are worth.

44
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:18,587
Why are you eager to form a dacoit gang?

45
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:21,171
My skills aren't helping me these days.

46
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:24,804
They keep the money in
the pocket of their shirts.

47
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,344
They don't keep anything
in their pant pockets.

48
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,463
Go and steal from the houses.

49
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:33,442
That won't help.

50
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,177
People don't have silver
or copper utensils.

51
00:07:36,577 --> 00:07:38,382
They use glass utensils.

52
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:39,939
Steal money.

53
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:42,631
They don't keep cash.
They keep cheque books at home.

54
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:45,658
They have cash, jewelry and gold coins.

55
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:48,664
I'm not sure if people
have silver utensils.

56
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:53,237
But, they've big brass glasses,
copper utensils.

57
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:56,610
You'll get everything.
- Where?

58
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,891
In the house of Ratan Banerjee.

59
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:01,550
Don't speak nonsense.

60
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:05,388
You are scared of their dog.
- Dog?

61
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:07,226
It won't take me long to hypnotize it.

62
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,738
Then what are you scared of?

63
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:10,836
Their loyal and strong servant Panchu..

64
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,998
..he can kill people with his stick.

65
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:16,382
Then he is more powerful than you.
- Don't talk rubbish.

66
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:19,668
How do you know about
what the Banerjee family has?

67
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:21,117
I saw it with my own eyes.

68
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,290
Did you enter their house?

69
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,814
They had called me.

70
00:08:25,063 --> 00:08:27,614
They want to make a gold
nose ring for the Goddess.

71
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,436
Have you made it?
- Yes. I'll deliver it tomorrow.

72
00:08:35,786 --> 00:08:37,809
Oh no! The power cuts have
become a regular occurrence..

73
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:38,890
..before the festival.

74
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:40,100
It's unbearable.

75
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,463
It's difficult to work
under these circumstances.

76
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,879
Give me the lantern from the shelf.

77
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:48,404
Be careful. Don't break it.

78
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:49,582
Bring it carefully.

79
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:51,280
I'll get it. Don't shout.

80
00:08:55,712 --> 00:08:56,696
Keep it.

81
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:02,923
Is it made of gold?
- Most of it is gold.

82
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:05,150
What about the remaining portion?

83
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,733
Gopi da, you've added
impurities to the gold that..

84
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,139
..you've used to make
the jewelry of the Goddess?

85
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,950
Gold is like human character.

86
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:14,360
It has pure as well
as impure substances in it.

87
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,133
Both of them together
makes it interesting.

88
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:34,359
Master..
- Hmm..

89
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,511
..it's late.

90
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:48,392
12:30?
- 1:30. Take this.

91
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:51,862
What's this?

92
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,251
Dew drops fall at this time.

93
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:57,397
But, you can't feel it.

94
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:04,564
When will the drummers
come tomorrow morning?

95
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,743
They'll be late this year.
- Why?

96
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,153
The high tide is scheduled
later in the day.

97
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:14,834
What if the drummers
have to go back tomorrow?

98
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:17,192
This is why I don't like
it when you stay awake till late.

99
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,559
You stay awake worry unnecessarily.

100
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,900
We'll complete 30
years of puja this year.

101
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:26,716
If anything unpleasant happens then..

102
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:36,294
..we'll lose the property,
our grandeur, celebrations.

103
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,483
Don't let unpleasant
thoughts disturb you.

104
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,073
As Pitru Paksh (fortnight dedicated
to ancestors) ends the Banerjee family..

105
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:52,262
Yes. My second son is
coming from America this year.

106
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:57,116
I'm planning to go to America with him.

107
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,132
What do you say?
- Do as you please.

108
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:07,461
I'll take you along.
- I won't go.

109
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:12,532
They also celebrate Durga puja grandly.

110
00:11:12,954 --> 00:11:14,067
Do they play the drums?

111
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,857
Do kashful ( Kans grass) bloom there?

112
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:25,138
I'll make a small hut
beside the river and stay here.

113
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:29,484
I won't go.

114
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,786
Go to bed.

115
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:37,052
On the dawn of autumn morning
as the cymbals are heard..

116
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:42,554
..the clouds spread across
the vast sky of this earth.

117
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:50,186
Nature announces the arrival
of the Goddess on this earth.

118
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:56,651
The steps of Anandamayi also
called Mahamaya can be heard tinkling.

119
00:12:56,953 --> 00:13:02,564
She brings along with
her a new beauty on this earth.

120
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:10,922
The beautiful green earth
welcomes the Mother Goddess.

121
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:22,651
"As the flute of Your
light starts playing.."

122
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:28,229
"..it fills the world with ecstasies."

123
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:38,488
"As the flute of Your
light starts playing.."

124
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:51,288
"When I heard the music this
morning I opened the doors of my mind."

125
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:58,239
"It starts playing..
it starts playing.."

126
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:26,899
Lakshmi, Saraswati comes with
the better half of Lord Shiva Parvati.

127
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:31,276
You are the generous,
benevolent Goddess.

128
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:38,800
She is the daughter of sage Kaktayan,
Goddess Kaktayani.

129
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:42,313
She is also called Kanyakumari.

130
00:14:42,393 --> 00:14:46,734
She is Durga the primordial energy.

131
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,276
She is Sati, the devoted wife.

132
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:54,184
She takes on a fiery
form to vanquish evil.

133
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:59,200
Her complexion becomes fiery,
her eyes emit fire.

134
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:05,653
On this dawn, Goddess we
devotedly welcome your presence.

135
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:12,691
Let flowers bloom everywhere.

136
00:15:13,004 --> 00:15:18,053
The powerful light, Mother Durga..

137
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:22,670
..may your presence
fill the earth with life.

138
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:27,113
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up, Mother.

139
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:31,458
"Wake up.."

140
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:40,507
"Wake up."

141
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:45,112
"Wake up Durga."

142
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:51,177
"Wake up Mother who carries
ten weapons in your ten hands."

143
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:59,209
"Wake up Mother who instills courage
in everybody and is incomparable."

144
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:01,685
"Wake up.."

145
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:04,096
"Wake up."

146
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:10,777
"You are the boon-provider,
ageless and incomparable."

147
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:15,825
"You are the boon-provider,
ageless and incomparable."

148
00:16:16,863 --> 00:16:22,693
"The bearer of several powers,
controller of cardinal passions."

149
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:27,741
Devi Durga was given weapons
by gods to fulfill her purpose.

150
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:30,736
Come. Come.

151
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:33,547
Come. Come.

152
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:37,644
Come. Come.

153
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,196
Come. Come.

154
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:44,455
The Goddess decked
up in her fierce form.

155
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:46,833
Himachal gave her a lion, her carrier.

156
00:16:46,913 --> 00:16:48,498
Vishnu gave her chakra (discuss).

157
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:51,536
Lord Shiva gave his trident.

158
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:53,590
Lord Yama gave her kaldand.

159
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,990
Kaal (time) gave her
shining sword and armor.

160
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,536
Chandra dev gave her beauty.

161
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,654
The sun gave her bows and arrows.

162
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:04,129
Vishwakarma gave her Farsa,
weapons made of fresh flowers.

163
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:06,864
Brahma gave her kamandalu (water pot).

164
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:08,583
Kuber gifted her wealth.

165
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,102
The gods decked up the
Goddess with different weapons.

166
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:19,081
They prayed to the Goddess
to defeat Asura (evil).

167
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:25,178
The three worlds resounded
with the battle cry.

168
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:38,130
Everyone prayed devotedly to the Goddess,
their savior before her journey.

169
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:45,006
"Salutations. Salutations.."

170
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:52,509
Wake up. Wake up, son.

171
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:54,876
Won't you listen to Mahalaya
(hymns dedicated to the goddess)?

172
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,228
It's almost over.

173
00:17:58,022 --> 00:17:59,611
I'll listen to the cassette.

174
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,195
Your father is going to the city.
Will you go there?

175
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:04,162
Why is he going there?

176
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,422
He'll call your uncle
from the SDO's house.

177
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:09,049
Go with him. You can talk to Tinni.

178
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:15,200
No. She speaks only in English.

179
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,227
Come on, wake up.
Your grandfather will be angry.

180
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:23,481
Why does grandpa get
up so early in the morning?

181
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:27,372
Uncle Panchu was saying
that he didn't sleep last night.

182
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:31,966
How did Panchu know?

183
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:34,680
I think he also didn't sleep.

184
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,842
That's very bad.
- Why?

185
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,755
Jimmy also can't sleep
if anyone in the house is awake.

186
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:47,284
Look at the way he is sleeping now.

187
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,397
Wake up.

188
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:56,214
Switch on the radio.

189
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,203
I'll hear it from the bathroom.

190
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,856
"If one bathes You, the virtuous
with the golden waters of the ocean.."

191
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:14,417
"..will he not experience
the divine joy?"

192
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:16,201
"..will he not experience
the divine joy?"

193
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:19,855
"If one bathes You, the virtuous
with the golden waters of the ocean.."

194
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,320
"..will he not experience
the divine joy?"

195
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:48,297
Chotka (youngest uncle).

196
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:54,211
Father is going out.

197
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,443
He is calling you.

198
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:57,562
Won't you get the
ornaments for the Goddess?

199
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,172
You always bunk exercise.

200
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:03,389
It won't help me.

201
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,108
My biceps measure only 8 inch.

202
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:07,465
It'll never become
15 if you don't work out.

203
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:10,794
Is yours 15?
- 16.

204
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:13,281
Ok. I'll exercise. Ready.

205
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,881
Can you say why Arjun
was also called Sabyasachi?

206
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:29,681
He could shoot arrows
with both his hands.

207
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:32,632
Why aren't you using your left hand?

208
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,729
It's over for the day.

209
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,334
My call has come.

210
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:48,188
Mother told you to buy a conch shell.

211
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:50,567
It'll be mentioned in the list.

212
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:52,307
It's not for Durga puja.
It's for her daily use.

213
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,962
Have this.

214
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:11,962
I'm supposed to observe a fast
today without even drinking water?

215
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,687
The rituals don't matter
in case of medicine.

216
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:17,649
Let me finish my prayers first.

217
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:19,422
I'll ask you to give it to me.

218
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,530
Has Bhupen come?
- Yes.

219
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:31,854
What about the drummers?

220
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:33,281
It's not yet time for them to arrive.

221
00:21:34,956 --> 00:21:36,016
Anyone else?

222
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:40,740
He won't come.

223
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,091
If he comes?

224
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:46,243
We'll do something if he comes.

225
00:21:56,136 --> 00:22:00,331
Why did the Goddess give
it when She had t take it away.

226
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:11,563
Bhupen da..
- Yes, tell me.

227
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:14,396
What's the measurement of
Mahisasur's bicep? - What?

228
00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,948
Why is Mahisasur green in color?

229
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:18,548
Which colour would you prefer?

230
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:21,499
Blue. Colour of Supreman.

231
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:24,083
But, how can the Goddess kill Superman.

232
00:22:24,163 --> 00:22:28,861
Bupen da, what do I need to bring?

233
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:30,903
The list is with master.

234
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,309
Get everything mentioned in it.

235
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:33,725
Don't forget the chandmala
(moon shaped paper garland)..

236
00:22:33,805 --> 00:22:35,790
..like you did last year.
- Ok.

237
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,898
Listen.. come back and help me.
- Work Education?

238
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:41,801
We need to decorate the courtyard.

239
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:42,968
It's grandpa's order.

240
00:22:44,158 --> 00:22:45,985
Why did you take so long?

241
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:56,168
How can I go without taking bath?

242
00:22:56,248 --> 00:22:59,541
I can't call from Mahitosh's
place if we don't reach there within 10.

243
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:01,995
Come on, hurry up. Let's go.
- Ok.

244
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:17,660
Once I witnessed the
Puja celebrations in Kolkata.

245
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,098
In your maternal uncle's house?

246
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:21,336
They don't make clay
idols at home like we do.

247
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,590
The idols comes in lorries.

248
00:23:22,828 --> 00:23:24,449
That happens only in Kolkata.

249
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:27,952
I've heard of Mother
arriving in boat, horse.

250
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:29,563
But Mother arriving in a lorry..

251
00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:32,146
Is Mother bricks or wheat?

252
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,449
How does the idol arrive on horse?

253
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:38,039
The idol doesn't arrive on horse,
Mother arrives on horse.

254
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:39,498
What do you mean?

255
00:23:39,578 --> 00:23:42,071
According to scriptures
Mother comes to earth..

256
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:43,411
..on different modes
of transport every year.

257
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:46,319
Sometimes she comes riding
a horse and sometimes an elephant.

258
00:23:46,535 --> 00:23:48,503
What is she arriving on this year?
- On a boat.

259
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,026
It is a good sign.

260
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:52,751
Arriving on a boat
signifies good harvest.

261
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:53,843
Check it out.

262
00:23:54,762 --> 00:23:55,789
The harvest will be very good this year.

263
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,016
Will mangoes grow on our tree?
- Of course.

264
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:01,334
There'll be wealth and
prosperity in every household.

265
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:04,545
Drums.

266
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:40,449
Mother.. where are your scissors?

267
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:42,556
You want my scissor again?

268
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:45,324
Grandpa told me to
decorate the courtyard.

269
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,934
Today on Mahalaya
(beginning of Devi paksha)?

270
00:25:47,994 --> 00:25:49,237
Let me start doing it from today.

271
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:51,713
I won't be able to
do anything when she comes.

272
00:25:52,027 --> 00:25:57,108
Who? Who is coming?
- Tinni Banerjee from America.

273
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:01,529
Tinni is a very nice girl.

274
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,199
Not at all.
She always speaks in English.

275
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:07,778
Bhupen, has the jewelry for
Mother arrived? - Grandpa!

276
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:11,389
What are you doing?

277
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:12,372
Panchu!

278
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:14,967
Look, the drummers have arrived.

279
00:26:15,047 --> 00:26:18,222
Grandpa is in the courtyard
but I haven't got the scissors yet.

280
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:21,756
I couldn't go to take
bath because of you.

281
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:24,459
I have to make arrangements
for the veneration

282
00:26:24,988 --> 00:26:27,864
Greetings. I've come from distant land.

283
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:31,313
Where is Ratan Lal
Banerjee's 'bati' (house)?

284
00:26:31,518 --> 00:26:34,588
'Bati' (bowl). You mean copper bowl?

285
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:42,037
Ratan Lal Banerjee's copper bowl?
How will I know?

286
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:45,268
Go and ask Gopi, the goldsmith.

287
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,744
Your knowledge of language is very weak.

288
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:55,528
I'm asking you the address
of Ratan lal Banerjee's house.

289
00:26:56,372 --> 00:26:57,810
Can't you speak in Bengali?

290
00:26:58,772 --> 00:27:01,766
I think I'm talking in Bengali.

291
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:04,902
I don't know whose ominous
face I saw when I woke up.

292
00:27:04,982 --> 00:27:06,696
Go from here. Spare me.

293
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:08,296
There is the person who
can give you the information.

294
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:09,896
Go and talk to him.

295
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:13,042
Well, there's no time to spare and rest.

296
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:16,058
Well, you are a busy man.

297
00:27:16,858 --> 00:27:19,258
I'll find his address. Thank you.

298
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:42,068
Sir! Sir! Sir!

299
00:27:47,495 --> 00:27:50,716
Come on, shake hands with me.

300
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:58,122
Shake hands? Of course.

301
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,982
Please allow me to leave.

302
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,804
You want to go to Ratan
Banerjee's house. Right?

303
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:12,112
Go straight. You'll find
a Diospyros tree on the right.

304
00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:15,744
If you take left from there
you'll reach Mr. Ratan Banerjee's house.

305
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:18,803
You'll find them preparing for Durga puja.
- Thank you.

306
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,338
Be careful. They've a dog.

307
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:41,712
I can't play it. Please guide me.
- I will.

308
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:44,026
You'll play during the arati
(prayers) on Saptami evening.

309
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:46,717
There'll be rock and roll
performance on Saptami evening.

310
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:48,631
Tinni is coming from America.

311
00:28:50,933 --> 00:28:54,414
Habul, what are you doing?

312
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:56,501
Saw you cutting papers some time back.

313
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:59,323
Now you are paying the drum.
What about studies?

314
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:03,323
I'll start after Lakshmi puja.
Ask mother. - Ok.

315
00:29:03,971 --> 00:29:07,939
I'll finish my work and take
you to the garden at the backyard.

316
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:10,685
Why?
- I'll teach you how to use the stick.

317
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:14,491
When will you go?
- Have patience.

318
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:16,394
Stop hitting the drum.

319
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:20,242
You haven't finished
decorating the courtyard yet?

320
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:23,031
The Goddess' jewelry hasn't arrived yet.
- So what?

321
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,702
I won't be able to do anything until
Chotka arrives. I can't do it alone.

322
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:30,059
I think someone is at the door.

323
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:47,907
Does Ratan Lal Banerjee stay here?

324
00:29:49,702 --> 00:29:50,740
He is my grandpa.

325
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:52,762
Are you his son's son or daughter's son?

326
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:55,746
I'm his elder son's son.

327
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,200
Who are you?
- I'm Gandharva Kumar.

328
00:29:58,372 --> 00:30:01,486
You..
- I wish to meet your grandfather.

329
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:02,804
Oh!

330
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:05,907
Grandpa is praying right now.
- I'll wait here.

331
00:30:06,394 --> 00:30:08,048
No. No. Come inside.

332
00:30:08,254 --> 00:30:09,335
I'll control Jimmy.

333
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,222
You don't have to.

334
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:16,816
Humans can be enemies but animals,
birds and nature are my friends.

335
00:30:18,254 --> 00:30:19,616
Do you write poetry?

336
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:22,038
Gopi da!

337
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:27,897
What happened? Why are you panting?

338
00:30:27,977 --> 00:30:29,054
Was anyone chasing you?

339
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:32,816
I'll be able to form
my gang of dacoits now.

340
00:30:36,588 --> 00:30:37,561
Have you got a lottery?

341
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:38,599
I don't know yet.

342
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:39,627
A man from a distant
land has come to our village.

343
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:40,913
He has a diamond ring on his finger.

344
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:43,854
If it's a real diamond ring then
it won't be less than 100,000 rupees.

345
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:45,194
What do I have to do?

346
00:30:45,464 --> 00:30:47,626
Just assure that it's real diamond.

347
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:49,605
Come on, give me the ring

348
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:51,518
I don't have it.

349
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,621
I don't have it yet. It's with that man.

350
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:57,313
You've started dreaming
before you've achieved anything.

351
00:30:58,005 --> 00:31:00,167
It won't take me long to get that ring.

352
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,195
You just have to tell
me if it's worth the hard work.

353
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:06,763
How do I see it?

354
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,898
You are supposed to visit
Ratan Banerjee's house. Right? - Yes.

355
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,325
To give the nose ring of the goddess?
- Yes.

356
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:14,957
The man has gone there.

357
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,590
What if I don't meet him?

358
00:31:16,957 --> 00:31:19,433
You will. The goddess
will definitely be kind to us.

359
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:21,962
Mother! Mother!

360
00:31:22,243 --> 00:31:23,638
Mother..
- Yes?

361
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:26,437
..a gentleman has come to meet grandpa.

362
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:28,653
Tell him to sit.
- Yes, I told him.

363
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,594
From where is he coming?
- I'm not sure.

364
00:31:31,908 --> 00:31:33,486
But I think he has
come from a distant place.

365
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,362
Tell someone to give
him sweets and sherbet.

366
00:31:36,903 --> 00:31:40,286
Grandpa will meet him only after
he offers prayers and has breakfast.

367
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,735
I'll go. They've started
playing the drums.

368
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:45,433
Don't forget to offer
him sherbet and sweets.

369
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:44,264
You play really well,
Gandharva Kumar da.

370
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,751
Did you like it?
- Yes.

371
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,286
Please come inside.

372
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:50,502
Mother has arranged snacks for you.

373
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:53,951
Convey my thanks
and regards to her. - Ok.

374
00:32:59,453 --> 00:33:01,432
Please come in. this way.
- Ok.

375
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:08,015
Gandharva Kuar da..
- I feel uneasy if you address me that way.

376
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:12,491
Oh! Then what shall I address you as?
Kumar babu?

377
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:16,696
Address me as Genu da.
- Ok.

378
00:33:16,923 --> 00:33:18,674
What's your name?
- Habul.

379
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,819
My good name is
Kaustav Kanti Banerjee. - Nice name.

380
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:24,598
Let's talk.
- Oh!

381
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:28,133
Have the snacks, I'll make
arrangements of your relaxation.

382
00:33:31,213 --> 00:33:35,429
Your language is also
weak just like the thief.

383
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:37,127
Thief?

384
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:39,731
I met him on the way.

385
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:43,418
He was staring at my ring greedily.

386
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:47,634
Is your ring expensive?
- Of course.

387
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,910
It belongs to our royal family.
- Royal family.

388
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:54,316
Are you a prince?

389
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:56,467
That's why you speak in chaste Bengali.

390
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:20,630
All this is rubbish.
They don't have any value.

391
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:24,782
Doesn't any of them match that one?

392
00:34:25,322 --> 00:34:26,739
He had a bigger stone.

393
00:34:27,074 --> 00:34:28,090
It wasn't dull like all these.

394
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,133
It was shining bright.

395
00:34:31,387 --> 00:34:34,144
Describe the ring properly.

396
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:42,533
Do something, Gopi da.

397
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:44,934
Go and see the ring.

398
00:34:46,296 --> 00:34:48,134
Tell me about your intentions first.

399
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:54,677
I'll see the ring and make a fake one.

400
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:56,763
What next?

401
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,622
After that you'll see
how efficient Sashti Charan is.

402
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:06,136
I'll replace the original
ring with the fake one.

403
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:09,131
What next?
- What next?

404
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:15,368
I'll break your limbs.

405
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:17,271
What will be my share?

406
00:35:18,957 --> 00:35:20,622
You'll get everything.

407
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,297
I don't want much.

408
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:29,671
8 horses, 6 guns, cartridges
and advance to my gang members.

409
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:32,265
I also need a crowbar.

410
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:34,827
Are you aware of the expenses?

411
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:36,978
Do something.

412
00:35:37,432 --> 00:35:38,740
Go to Agra.

413
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:44,567
Take the crowbar with you.
Steal Taj Mahal and sell it.

414
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,292
You won't be satisfied
with anything else.

415
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,378
Gopi da, make a miniature
Taj Mahal for me.

416
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:05,680
Can you guess what is this?

417
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:10,631
Lotus.

418
00:36:15,398 --> 00:36:16,469
Bird?

419
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:18,404
Genu da..

420
00:36:21,496 --> 00:36:22,869
..how long will you stay here?

421
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:26,328
I'll travel to my
capital tomorrow morning.

422
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:28,566
Tomorrow? Oh no!

423
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:32,026
I thought that you'll be able to help
me with the work education projects.

424
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,550
I've very less time.

425
00:36:34,728 --> 00:36:36,393
There's conspiracy everywhere.

426
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:38,522
The subjects are disturbed.

427
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:43,073
It won't be right to stay away
from my capital for a long time..

428
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:44,457
..under the present circumstances.

429
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,165
So much is going on?

430
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:49,073
Where is your capital? Murshidabad?

431
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:53,063
Don't ask me. It's confidential.

432
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,312
Let me get back my throne
and then I'll tell you.

433
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:10,262
Chariot? - I can't send a chariot,
I'll send horses instead.

434
00:37:13,268 --> 00:37:14,684
But, I can't ride the horse.

435
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:19,214
My soldier will train
you in horse riding.

436
00:37:21,268 --> 00:37:22,544
Do soldiers ride horses?

437
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:28,706
Oh no! they've arrived.
- Who?

438
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,116
My cousin sister.

439
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:33,776
She is a dangerous girl.
She is over-smart.

440
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:34,911
Can she ride the horse?

441
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,554
Hi, aunt!

442
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:39,581
You've made my clothes impure.

443
00:37:39,852 --> 00:37:44,100
She has just touched you.
I'll kiss you.

444
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:45,322
Tinni, open your shoes.

445
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:47,787
You've had a haircut?

446
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:52,198
Why? Don't I look good in it?
- You look beautiful just like Tinni.

447
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:55,213
Your complexion has tanned, sister.

448
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,835
Habul. Habul's complexion
has also tanned.

449
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:01,256
Tinni, come and touch
your elder brother's feet.

450
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:07,159
The grown up boy sleeps with his mother.

451
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:45,462
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

452
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:48,500
Six. Seen. Eight. Nine. Ten.

453
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:50,824
Brother, why ten hands?

454
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:53,635
She is the Goddess with
ten hands so she had ten hands.

455
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:57,041
No. sometime she has
eight and sometimes even 16.

456
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,468
Eight hands? Is she an octopus?

457
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,246
I read about it in
Indian mythology books.

458
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:06,845
You read about Goddess Durga in English?

459
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,953
Mrs. Banerjee, where is your husband?

460
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:17,926
He went to call his irresponsible
brother who lives abroad and..

461
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:20,931
..who didn't inform when he is coming.

462
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:25,309
No! I sent a telegram.
- No! we didn't get it.

463
00:39:25,504 --> 00:39:26,520
How will you get it?

464
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,688
I peon knocked at the
door and went back when..

465
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:28,801
..he didn't get any answer.

466
00:39:29,072 --> 00:39:30,196
You sleep.

467
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,434
When did you find me sleeping?

468
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:34,153
Then how come you gained so much weight?

469
00:39:34,434 --> 00:39:35,883
Why are you pulling her leg?

470
00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:38,369
After all she is elder to you.
Did you touch her feet?

471
00:39:39,256 --> 00:39:42,024
The Bongs have decided
not to bow down before anyone.

472
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:44,813
Boudi (sister-in-law),
can you touch your feet..

473
00:39:44,893 --> 00:39:46,391
..without bending your knees?

474
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:47,742
What will I get if I do it?

475
00:39:47,822 --> 00:39:49,688
Rice cooker. You won't
have to strain the excess water.

476
00:39:49,768 --> 00:39:50,931
Sure?
- Yes.

477
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:56,218
Great! Come on place
your hands on my head now.

478
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:58,510
I've sought your blessings.
- Shut up!

479
00:39:59,170 --> 00:39:59,991
I had no other option.

480
00:40:00,071 --> 00:40:02,532
Slip disc. I can't bend down.
- Is it?

481
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:03,825
Sanatan!

482
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:07,089
You've come?

483
00:40:07,284 --> 00:40:10,830
I'm coming.
- Hi Panchu da! How are you?

484
00:40:11,511 --> 00:40:14,430
Not good. I'm still a bachelor.

485
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:17,326
You promised to bring
a English bride for me.

486
00:40:17,406 --> 00:40:18,299
I've brought one for you.

487
00:40:18,526 --> 00:40:19,975
Where is she?
- In my bag.

488
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:45,575
Why are you taking
me to that house, Gopi da?

489
00:40:46,786 --> 00:40:47,986
I'll tell them that
you've mended your ways..

490
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,587
..and are learning work from me.

491
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,451
What do you mean? Was I bad?

492
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,927
Everything is like
that in the beginning.

493
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:58,667
When you start earning money
and name everyone respects you.

494
00:40:58,852 --> 00:41:00,171
Take the case of Ratan Banerjee.

495
00:41:00,744 --> 00:41:02,387
He led a poverty
ridden life in the past.

496
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:04,344
He lives in a palatial building now.

497
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:05,598
He has cars.

498
00:41:05,782 --> 00:41:06,906
He orgabizes puja.

499
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:08,128
How does he manage all this?

500
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:10,031
Did Ratan Banerjee
form a gang of robbers?

501
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,409
Everybody is not like you.

502
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,603
Then he must taken up
the profession of a goldsmith.

503
00:41:15,068 --> 00:41:17,500
Sashti, you are crossing your limit.

504
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:23,209
Genu da..
do you've coins? Mother needs it.

505
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:27,166
Coins? Are coins easily
available like bananas?

506
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,944
The coins will be kept next
to bananas in the prayer room.

507
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,609
Dada (elder brother),
Boma (aunt)is calling you.

508
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:39,089
I thinks he is your cousin from abroad?
- Yes. Tinni.

509
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,895
I told you about her.
- Yes.

510
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:44,722
His name is Genu da.
- Hi!

511
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,678
Prince. Gandharva Kumar.
- Prince?

512
00:41:49,684 --> 00:41:51,954
Really? I don't believe you.

513
00:41:56,516 --> 00:41:59,165
Take it.
- It's only one. I asked for two.

514
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:01,025
You asked for two?

515
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:03,252
Ok. Keep this.

516
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:12,289
Now there are two.
- Wow! Great!

517
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:13,662
You are like Houdini.

518
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:15,402
Do you know Houdini.

519
00:42:17,607 --> 00:42:19,694
Chotka has come.
- Oh!

520
00:42:19,774 --> 00:42:21,456
I'm going. See you.

521
00:42:23,694 --> 00:42:25,888
You know magic too?
- I know many other things.

522
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:27,975
Your mother is waiting for you.

523
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,246
Her prayers won't get over
if you don't give her the coins.

524
00:42:30,689 --> 00:42:32,894
You may leave now.
- Oh

525
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:38,494
"She eats mangoes and
berries and hamburger."

526
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,705
"She also eats sweet potatoes,
paniphal and fried snacks."

527
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,289
"She eats Indian fried
snacks with mayonnaise."

528
00:42:46,808 --> 00:42:50,127
"She has fried frogs for breakfast."
- Oh no!

529
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:54,375
"Sweetwater fish and oblation.."

530
00:42:54,732 --> 00:42:57,943
"..Our Tinni loves them."

531
00:42:58,483 --> 00:43:04,709
Chotka.. did you bring
chandmala and the conch shell?

532
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:06,309
It's in the bag. Check it.

533
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,969
Dada, give it to me.

534
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,845
Will you be able to play it?

535
00:43:17,543 --> 00:43:19,207
Is Habul blowing the conch shell?

536
00:43:23,326 --> 00:43:24,667
It maybe Tinni.

537
00:43:25,034 --> 00:43:26,461
Can Tinni blow the conch shell?

538
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:30,310
Why Tinni is also a Brahmin's daughter.

539
00:43:31,521 --> 00:43:35,066
"The thunder of the dark clouds
resonates in the mountain peaks."

540
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:36,775
"The forest is shrouded in darkness."

541
00:43:36,855 --> 00:43:38,948
"It rains hevaily."

542
00:43:39,413 --> 00:43:47,268
The deer couple couldn't hear the
footsteps of the approaching hunter."

543
00:43:47,348 --> 00:43:51,888
"The tiger left behind
his footprints on this path."

544
00:43:52,483 --> 00:43:53,510
This isn't Tinni.

545
00:43:53,877 --> 00:43:57,077
No. it's my wife.

546
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,969
Let's go.

547
00:43:59,142 --> 00:44:00,720
We've to go to the prayer room
when father finishes his prayers.

548
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,823
Come on.

549
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:07,909
Genu da..
grandpa has finished his prayers.

550
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:09,806
I'll go and tell your name to him.

551
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,795
Don't mention my name.

552
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,806
Say that Ram Dulal's grandson is here.

553
00:44:15,882 --> 00:44:20,347
Son's son or daughter's son?
- He knows the hint.

554
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:25,017
Bisheswar Banerjee of sandilya gotra.

555
00:44:27,893 --> 00:44:30,639
Pratima Banerjee.. - Daughter-in-law, come.
- Coming, father.

556
00:44:34,152 --> 00:44:35,482
Bireshwar Banerjee

557
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:36,898
It's my turn before him, father.

558
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,206
When did you come?
- A little while ago.

559
00:44:40,286 --> 00:44:42,022
Me first. Grandpa, me first.

560
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:44,357
Yes, darling. You first. Take this.

561
00:44:45,525 --> 00:44:47,103
You came without
sending any information.

562
00:44:47,482 --> 00:44:48,779
I sent a telegram.

563
00:44:48,963 --> 00:44:50,401
I don't know why you didn't get it.

564
00:44:50,481 --> 00:44:52,768
Somshwar Banerjee of sandilya gotra.

565
00:44:53,093 --> 00:44:54,120
Daughter-in-law, how are you?

566
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,775
How are you father?
- As good as I can be at this age.

567
00:44:59,472 --> 00:45:01,829
Bireshwar Banerjee of sandilya gotra.

568
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:08,542
Grandpa..
- Why are you always late, Habul?

569
00:45:08,763 --> 00:45:10,482
I was attending the guest.

570
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,801
Who is this guest?
- Genu da. Gandharva Kumar.

571
00:45:14,471 --> 00:45:17,162
What's this?
You haven't finished praying yet.

572
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:19,790
Gandharva Kumar.

573
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:21,844
He said that he is
a prince of some place.

574
00:45:21,924 --> 00:45:25,022
He said that there's a hint
word which you'll understand.

575
00:45:25,595 --> 00:45:26,860
What's the hint word?

576
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:28,395
Ram Dulal's grandson is here.

577
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,108
Panchu, tell them to drop
the fishing nets in the pond.

578
00:45:36,146 --> 00:45:38,676
Ram Dulal's grandson shouldn't
be uncomfortable here.

579
00:45:40,665 --> 00:45:43,021
Habul, tell him to be seated.

580
00:45:43,638 --> 00:45:44,967
Grandpa will meet him
after he eats something.

581
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,432
I'll eat later.

582
00:45:53,908 --> 00:45:56,579
Habul, tell him to wait
in the drawing room downstairs.

583
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,265
I'll go there.

584
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:10,093
What's wrong, uncle Panchu?
- Nothing.

585
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:13,206
Don't worry. Have a good time.

586
00:46:20,103 --> 00:46:21,681
What's wrong?

587
00:46:27,022 --> 00:46:28,913
Wait here. I'll go and check.

588
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:37,594
Why is grandpa so upset?

589
00:46:39,238 --> 00:46:40,362
What did she say?

590
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,276
Why is grandpa so upset?

591
00:46:43,507 --> 00:46:47,259
He met you after a long time,
so he got emotional.

592
00:46:49,065 --> 00:46:52,546
Get up and help sister-in-law
serve the guest.

593
00:46:57,735 --> 00:46:58,880
Let's go.

594
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:04,210
What's wrong?
- I'm not sure.

595
00:47:05,506 --> 00:47:08,047
Dada.. do you know anything?

596
00:47:10,004 --> 00:47:11,669
I'm also not aware of anything.

597
00:47:16,232 --> 00:47:21,605
Ram Dulal's grandson.. Ram Dulal?

598
00:48:08,446 --> 00:48:09,538
Grandpa..

599
00:48:14,911 --> 00:48:16,381
..here he is.

600
00:48:24,014 --> 00:48:26,717
Habul, I wish to talk to him alone.

601
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:30,435
No one should disturb me.

602
00:49:00,296 --> 00:49:02,015
You play really bad.

603
00:49:02,095 --> 00:49:03,540
I'm trying my best.

604
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:04,955
Is this your best?

605
00:49:05,035 --> 00:49:06,198
It's better than you.

606
00:49:06,425 --> 00:49:08,501
Bhupen da, who plays better? She or I?

607
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:13,063
It's better when both
of you aren't playing.

608
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,355
Who was worst amongst the two of us?

609
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:16,901
I didn't notice that.

610
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,284
I was thinking about something else.

611
00:49:20,565 --> 00:49:21,517
What is it?

612
00:49:21,797 --> 00:49:24,446
Ram was proving to be difficult,
now he has Sugreev for company.

613
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:25,927
What do you mean?

614
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:28,132
You have read Ramayana in English?

615
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:29,970
Didn't you read about Sugreev?

616
00:49:30,186 --> 00:49:31,051
Please tell me.

617
00:49:31,131 --> 00:49:32,867
Open your shoes.

618
00:49:42,304 --> 00:49:43,428
Jimmy!

619
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:45,958
Jimmy sit down.

620
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:51,287
Is master at home?

621
00:49:52,714 --> 00:49:54,163
Grandpa is busy.

622
00:49:54,444 --> 00:49:55,612
He asked me to deliver something.

623
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:57,579
Shall I call father ?

624
00:49:57,752 --> 00:49:59,925
Shall we wait for some time?
- Ok.

625
00:50:00,596 --> 00:50:02,477
I hope he won't bite us.
- No.

626
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:04,478
Come inside.

627
00:50:08,953 --> 00:50:13,148
You've a guest at home today. Right?
- Guest? - Yes.

628
00:50:14,034 --> 00:50:16,466
No.. my uncle has come from America.

629
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:17,536
No. there is someone else.

630
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,504
He asked me your address.

631
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:20,833
He had a big ring on his finger.

632
00:50:20,913 --> 00:50:23,190
No.. he is a handsome man.
- Oh!

633
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,768
Fair..
- Genu da?

634
00:50:24,848 --> 00:50:26,433
Genu da?
Is he your relative?

635
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:27,784
No, he has come to meet grandpa.

636
00:50:27,864 --> 00:50:29,373
You are right. Where is he?

637
00:50:29,453 --> 00:50:30,465
He is talking to grandpa.

638
00:50:30,545 --> 00:50:32,335
Won't we get to meet him?
- Grandpa?

639
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,811
Well, we travelled a
long distance to come here.

640
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:36,909
I'll seek master's blessings and leave.
- Oh!

641
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,016
Have a seat.

642
00:50:39,308 --> 00:50:40,962
Okay. Inform us when
your grandpa finishes talking.

643
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:42,357
You'll know when he finishes talking.

644
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,768
He is in that room.
- Ok.

645
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,022
This place is too sunny.

646
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:51,925
Shall we go inside and sit?
- Ok.

647
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:55,514
Sister, where shall I keep this?

648
00:50:56,152 --> 00:50:57,893
Keep it there,
I'll keep it inside later.

649
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:02,519
Can Tinni eat with her hands?
- Yes. Why not?

650
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:06,228
Why didn't you take out the glass?
- It's in the kitchen.

651
00:51:06,498 --> 00:51:07,427
Shall I bring it?

652
00:51:08,595 --> 00:51:09,871
Take the plates.

653
00:51:10,184 --> 00:51:11,557
The ground near the
shelf is very slippery.

654
00:51:15,676 --> 00:51:17,362
This is the reason why
you can touch your feet.

655
00:51:17,729 --> 00:51:18,378
What do you mean?

656
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:19,837
You exercise a lot daily.

657
00:51:20,096 --> 00:51:21,815
The utensils are very heavy.

658
00:51:24,929 --> 00:51:27,005
What's the price of kansa, Gopi da?

659
00:51:28,065 --> 00:51:30,238
You told me that you won't
touch anything you see here.

660
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:31,849
I won't touch anything.
I'm just asking.

661
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:34,141
You are asking?

662
00:51:36,465 --> 00:51:39,449
Do you have any evidence
except this ring?

663
00:51:41,763 --> 00:51:44,152
Yes, I have.
They'll come tonight.

664
00:51:45,071 --> 00:51:47,644
Who?
- Swet and Lohit.

665
00:51:48,476 --> 00:51:49,968
This is for Habul.

666
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:55,340
Do they wear this while running?
- No. No.

667
00:51:55,643 --> 00:51:57,124
This is worn before running.

668
00:51:57,513 --> 00:51:58,864
They open it while running.

669
00:51:59,081 --> 00:52:00,021
Take it.

670
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,038
This is for you.

671
00:52:05,848 --> 00:52:07,621
What's this?
- Hair dryer.

672
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:08,746
I'll show you how to use it.

673
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:11,351
That'll turn your hairs grey.

674
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,578
Dada, this is for you.

675
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:20,800
What's this? Hair dye?
- No. Cologne. - Ok.

676
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:23,363
This is for Panchu da.

677
00:52:27,482 --> 00:52:28,974
Shoes for uncle Panchu?

678
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:30,433
He needs it.

679
00:52:30,617 --> 00:52:31,882
He wanders here and there.

680
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:34,520
Last time I heard that
he was bitten by a snake.

681
00:52:34,953 --> 00:52:37,245
Once he stepped on something.

682
00:52:37,493 --> 00:52:38,790
This is for Biru.

683
00:52:39,071 --> 00:52:41,645
There's a razor.
It also has lipstick and nailpolish.

684
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:46,207
What will Biru do with all that?
- I'll take care of that.

685
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,413
You couldn't do anything
about it till date.

686
00:52:48,705 --> 00:52:50,121
I'll get Biru married this time.

687
00:52:50,586 --> 00:52:52,294
Show me the razor.

688
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:06,133
It isn't working.

689
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:10,046
Give it to me. You didn't switch it on.
- Oh!

690
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,620
Well, you've saved an expense.

691
00:53:17,117 --> 00:53:18,955
We won't have to call
a barber on Biru's wedding.

692
00:53:19,528 --> 00:53:21,279
They've brought a lot of gifts.

693
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,572
It's so late.

694
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,572
I'm drenched in sweat.

695
00:53:26,512 --> 00:53:28,339
Check if they've brought
expensive perfume.

696
00:53:29,064 --> 00:53:30,858
They've brought a
machine that heats water.

697
00:53:33,107 --> 00:53:33,745
Shall I steal it ?

698
00:53:33,825 --> 00:53:35,777
Do you want to heat the
water from the pond with it?

699
00:53:35,857 --> 00:53:36,967
Rascal!

700
00:53:37,853 --> 00:53:40,361
Make fun of me as much you wish to.

701
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:42,231
You are at a position
of advantage right now.

702
00:53:42,729 --> 00:53:45,702
I won't care for anyone
once I get the ring.

703
00:53:47,334 --> 00:53:48,502
It's not a ring.

704
00:53:48,956 --> 00:53:50,502
It's a royal treasure.

705
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:57,193
Is it pure gold, Chotka?
- No. it's gold foil.

706
00:53:57,582 --> 00:53:58,814
Golden foil.

707
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,944
You are so stupid, Tinni.

708
00:54:01,344 --> 00:54:03,593
If all these were made of gold then
we wouldn't be living in this house.

709
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:05,127
Then where would you've been?

710
00:54:05,207 --> 00:54:06,889
We would've been rich.

711
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:08,770
We would travel the world.

712
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:11,690
The pyramids of Egypt.

713
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:14,360
The hanging garden of Babylon.

714
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,381
Jungles of Africa.

715
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:18,490
The desert of Sahara.

716
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,063
Shame on you! What are you saying?

717
00:54:21,474 --> 00:54:23,149
How can you travel the world
by selling the ornaments of deities?

718
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:27,516
Will you go back tonight?

719
00:54:28,436 --> 00:54:29,668
Why do you want to know?

720
00:54:30,825 --> 00:54:36,133
They go back at night.
- They are active at night.

721
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:42,176
If I stay here.. will it
be a problem if I stay here tonight?

722
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,186
What are you saying?

723
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:46,813
You are my guest.

724
00:54:50,316 --> 00:54:52,381
Where did you meet him, Sashti?

725
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,067
Tell me where you met him.

726
00:54:56,814 --> 00:54:59,117
What are you up to? Are you sleeping?

727
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,744
Where did you meet him?

728
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:05,732
On the other side of the mountain.

729
00:55:19,884 --> 00:55:21,516
The gate is closed.

730
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:24,306
How do we get in?
- Chant the mantra.

731
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:25,722
Which mantra.

732
00:55:26,295 --> 00:55:30,295
Let's offer flowers and leaves
to the Goddess with sandalwood.

733
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:33,441
No! Those mantras won't help.

734
00:55:34,025 --> 00:55:35,928
Open the door.

735
00:55:40,123 --> 00:55:41,777
Hey! Hey!

736
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:45,571
Yes, he is the man.

737
00:55:46,479 --> 00:55:47,798
How are you, Mr. Sashti?

738
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:53,485
You.. how did you recognize me?

739
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,226
It's difficult to know a person.

740
00:55:55,593 --> 00:55:56,631
I only know your name.

741
00:55:57,172 --> 00:56:01,128
How?
- Your name is tattooed on your arms.

742
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,177
You are a good observer.

743
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:08,554
Your vision seems to be shrouded.

744
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,479
Perhaps because of your age.

745
00:56:10,965 --> 00:56:13,895
You can't see what you
wish to see from that distance.

746
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:15,689
Take a look.

747
00:56:17,355 --> 00:56:18,274
Wow!

748
00:56:19,636 --> 00:56:20,457
Beautiful!

749
00:56:20,537 --> 00:56:25,322
Is it American diamond?
- It's real diamond. Goodbye.

750
00:56:36,598 --> 00:56:38,933
He is smarter than you.

751
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:40,490
Come to the point.

752
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,198
Did you see the ring?
- Yes. I saw it.

753
00:56:42,955 --> 00:56:45,431
It's pure. Unadulterated.
- Sanatan!

754
00:56:47,745 --> 00:56:50,156
What brings you here?

755
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:55,268
What do you want?
- Well..

756
00:56:56,857 --> 00:56:58,587
I want to meet master.

757
00:56:59,105 --> 00:57:00,187
You can't meet him now. Come later.

758
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:03,128
I brought the nose ring
I made for the Goddess.

759
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:05,766
Give it to me.

760
00:57:06,566 --> 00:57:07,863
I'll give it to master.

761
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:09,474
Come in the evening.

762
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:16,209
Hey you!

763
00:57:16,404 --> 00:57:18,912
I?
- No. He.

764
00:57:36,372 --> 00:57:39,864
Master..
- Come in.

765
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:48,090
Sit down.

766
00:57:51,842 --> 00:57:53,096
Did you talk to him?

767
00:57:55,107 --> 00:57:58,826
The ring is real.
It belongs to Ram Dulal.

768
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:00,804
What shall you do now?

769
00:58:02,848 --> 00:58:06,750
I'll talk to my sons.
- Ok.

770
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,123
Gupi, the goldsmith had come.

771
00:58:15,831 --> 00:58:17,636
Tell elder son to give him the payment.

772
00:58:18,738 --> 00:58:20,814
He'll come in the evening.
I sent him back.

773
00:58:23,377 --> 00:58:25,907
Will you keep it or will
I give it to elder daughter-in-law?

774
00:58:26,523 --> 00:58:28,188
Keep it with you.

775
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:40,523
Why should I keep the
nose ring meant for veneration?

776
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,766
The puja may not take place.

777
00:58:44,512 --> 00:58:45,733
What are you saying, master?

778
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,063
Is he is inch hurry?

779
00:58:47,143 --> 00:58:48,966
Can't he wait for ten days?

780
00:58:49,701 --> 00:58:53,161
He is Ram Dulal grandson.
They don't wait.

781
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:00,004
Strange! You haven't
forgotten anything this time.

782
00:59:00,598 --> 00:59:01,982
I never forget anything.

783
00:59:02,869 --> 00:59:05,712
Last time I accidentally
forgot to bring the chandmala.

784
00:59:06,144 --> 00:59:08,869
What about the banana
leaves the year before?

785
00:59:09,042 --> 00:59:10,501
I didn't forget it.

786
00:59:11,171 --> 00:59:13,885
I kept it in the shop
and decided to bring it later.

787
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:15,895
You brought it only
after father scolded you.

788
00:59:16,187 --> 00:59:18,511
Habul! Mother is calling you for lunch.

789
00:59:18,836 --> 00:59:20,090
Bring Tinni with you.

790
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,344
Panchu da, listen to me.

791
00:59:26,081 --> 00:59:27,378
Won't Chotka come?

792
00:59:27,962 --> 00:59:29,162
The children will have lunch first.

793
00:59:29,681 --> 00:59:32,330
Bring that man too.

794
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,513
Man? Oh Genu da.

795
00:59:37,108 --> 00:59:39,670
Who is Genu da?
- Gandharva Kumar.

796
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,767
Who is he?

797
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:43,724
He has come to meet grandpa.
You didn't meet him.

798
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,703
Oh!

799
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:47,314
Ram Dulal's grandson.

800
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:49,584
Have your lunch.

801
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,882
You've to cut papers.
- It's done.

802
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:56,925
Did you cut them?
- No. Genu da did it.

803
01:00:05,554 --> 01:00:09,445
Gopi da, hurry up.
- Don't ask me to hasten up.

804
01:00:09,525 --> 01:00:11,727
It's a high class work.

805
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:14,267
No need to be so precise.

806
01:00:14,473 --> 01:00:17,002
We'll lament if we lose the target.

807
01:00:20,192 --> 01:00:23,294
We won't get to enjoy the goodies.

808
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:24,819
Take it.

809
01:00:27,813 --> 01:00:28,624
See.

810
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:32,559
Is it okay?

811
01:00:33,424 --> 01:00:34,786
You are a true artist.

812
01:00:35,911 --> 01:00:41,586
Will you be able to replace
the real ring with the fake one?

813
01:00:42,949 --> 01:00:44,657
Why do you think I'm useless?

814
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:48,019
I've been doing this job
since I was seven. - Is it?

815
01:00:50,591 --> 01:00:55,110
Pancha said that no one could
steal the duck eggs of Choudhury house.

816
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:57,457
One day I stole them.
- How?

817
01:00:58,623 --> 01:01:03,488
I replaced the egg with
a similar looking stone.

818
01:01:03,715 --> 01:01:06,050
They didn't even find out.
- When?

819
01:01:07,889 --> 01:01:09,770
I told you that I was
seven years old at that time.

820
01:01:10,018 --> 01:01:13,812
Stupid! I mean which day of the week.
At what time?

821
01:01:14,612 --> 01:01:17,618
Was it on Saturday?
Was it a new moon night?

822
01:01:19,586 --> 01:01:21,229
How would I know?

823
01:01:21,499 --> 01:01:23,596
I didn't consult the
almanac before stealing.

824
01:01:23,867 --> 01:01:27,045
That's why you never
did well in life, Sashti.

825
01:01:27,467 --> 01:01:29,488
Do you know what's
written in the scriptures?

826
01:01:29,704 --> 01:01:36,071
Anyone who goes out towards
south to do something important..

827
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:42,222
..on Saturday evening from his home..

828
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:45,368
..is blessed by Goddess
of Lakshmi (goddess of wealth)..

829
01:01:45,594 --> 01:01:49,054
..with wealth and prosperity.

830
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:02,428
Many years back on the full moon nights
of the month of Kartik (Oct-Nov)..

831
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:05,163
..celebrations would go on for a week.

832
01:02:05,866 --> 01:02:07,282
People from far and
wide would come here.

833
01:02:08,547 --> 01:02:11,423
The women of the house would
sit here and watch 'ras' (theatre)?

834
01:02:12,137 --> 01:02:13,196
What's 'ras', dada?

835
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:16,505
You mean gold rush?
- No. That's a movie.

836
01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:17,640
It was a jatra (folk theatre).

837
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,424
Was jatra performed here?

838
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:21,013
It used to be in the past.

839
01:02:21,315 --> 01:02:22,872
It's den of pigeons now.

840
01:02:24,829 --> 01:02:27,737
The broken palanquin that you
see there was used by the ladies..

841
01:02:27,817 --> 01:02:28,980
..of the family to travel
to the Ganges for a bath.

842
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,894
I've never been here before.

843
01:02:31,672 --> 01:02:33,088
Anyone hardly comes here.

844
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:36,115
So what? We are children we can come.

845
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,969
No one except grandpa came here.

846
01:02:39,261 --> 01:02:42,764
You mean the old men come here?
- Yes, they do.

847
01:02:43,498 --> 01:02:46,125
Grandpa comes. Panchu da comes.

848
01:02:46,353 --> 01:02:48,558
Daily?
- No.

849
01:02:50,148 --> 01:02:51,456
Sometimes.

850
01:02:52,732 --> 01:02:54,278
They come at strange time.

851
01:02:56,451 --> 01:02:58,581
Once I woke up from
sleep as I was hungry.

852
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:04,397
I was busy having biscuit
and jam in the kitchen when..

853
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:10,148
..I suddenly saw grandpa standing there.

854
01:03:12,332 --> 01:03:14,332
I looked at the clock. It was 2 am.

855
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:20,440
On another occasion,
it was winter, just before the exam..

856
01:03:20,873 --> 01:03:22,937
..i woke up early
in the morning to study.

857
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,002
Chotka had also not woken up.

858
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,764
I suddenly spotted grandpa
standing there alone amidst the fog.

859
01:03:31,143 --> 01:03:32,375
Kaustav.

860
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,152
Have this.
- Why?

861
01:03:46,385 --> 01:03:48,060
I know you are not
allowed to climb trees.

862
01:03:48,774 --> 01:03:50,731
But, I don't think you are
restricted from having fruits.

863
01:03:51,012 --> 01:03:53,639
Yes, I have. I just had lunch.
Why should I've fruits now?

864
01:03:55,152 --> 01:03:58,071
Don't worry about the outcome.
Do your duty.

865
01:04:09,044 --> 01:04:11,174
If you had broken the rod
grandpa would've been angry.

866
01:04:11,606 --> 01:04:13,455
Try it.

867
01:04:22,266 --> 01:04:23,315
Dada!

868
01:04:25,606 --> 01:04:27,012
My 'tip' (target) isn't good.

869
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:29,444
What's 'tip', dada?

870
01:04:29,671 --> 01:04:30,709
The one mother wears on her forehead?

871
01:04:33,163 --> 01:04:35,087
Genu da, what's the
English word for 'tip'?

872
01:04:37,455 --> 01:04:41,109
I've travelled to different
places like Venezuela..

873
01:04:41,531 --> 01:04:43,466
..Jerusalem, Honolulu.

874
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:47,249
But, English is not
widely used in those places.

875
01:04:48,611 --> 01:04:54,622
In easy language 'tip' means
the efficiency to hit a target.

876
01:04:55,573 --> 01:04:56,989
Do you call this easy language?

877
01:05:01,487 --> 01:05:06,320
Where do we find milk
that's sticky like gum of tree?

878
01:05:07,174 --> 01:05:08,233
You find it in fairytales.

879
01:05:09,163 --> 01:05:11,369
Come and stay with us.
I'll treat you to it.

880
01:05:12,936 --> 01:05:18,384
People go to America
for higher studies and job.

881
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:21,239
It'll be the first time that
someone will go there to drink milk.

882
01:05:24,322 --> 01:05:25,987
Your brother can't live without fish.

883
01:05:27,597 --> 01:05:29,176
I can't treat you
to small variety of fish.

884
01:05:29,586 --> 01:05:31,673
But there are substitutes for rohu fish.

885
01:05:32,322 --> 01:05:33,911
Shall I give fish fry to father?

886
01:05:35,393 --> 01:05:37,684
Father, you didn't eat anything.

887
01:05:41,068 --> 01:05:42,105
What's wrong, father?

888
01:05:42,765 --> 01:05:43,986
Are you feeling unwell?

889
01:05:46,754 --> 01:05:48,137
Has that boy finished his lunch?

890
01:05:48,386 --> 01:05:49,770
The three of them had lunch together.

891
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:51,791
Habul, Tinni and..

892
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:53,781
Panchu!

893
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:56,332
Where are they at the moment?

894
01:05:56,635 --> 01:05:57,716
They've gone out.

895
01:05:58,364 --> 01:05:59,672
They must be somewhere around.

896
01:06:01,186 --> 01:06:03,305
Father, shall I give kheer (sweet)?

897
01:06:04,192 --> 01:06:05,392
Bhuban had come yesterday.

898
01:06:05,472 --> 01:06:06,722
The kheer was nice so I bought it.

899
01:06:06,938 --> 01:06:08,603
You all have it.
- Yes, we will.

900
01:06:09,262 --> 01:06:10,538
You have it first.

901
01:06:10,938 --> 01:06:12,775
You didn't eat anything since morning.

902
01:06:13,186 --> 01:06:14,667
It's 3 pm now.

903
01:06:14,873 --> 01:06:15,998
You'll fall sick.

904
01:06:16,078 --> 01:06:18,679
Panchu, close the door.

905
01:06:27,501 --> 01:06:28,831
Meeting.

906
01:06:30,074 --> 01:06:31,955
You may faintly remember it.

907
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,528
Biru wasn't even born at that time.

908
01:06:34,971 --> 01:06:36,701
Daughters-in-law are
not supposed to know it.

909
01:06:38,765 --> 01:06:41,511
I started my life as
a priest of the temple.

910
01:06:42,495 --> 01:06:46,311
The owner of the temple
was Ram Dulal Sarkar.

911
01:06:46,744 --> 01:06:49,004
People would call him
Raja (king) Ram Dulal.

912
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:52,226
His critics would call
him dacoit Ram Dulal.

913
01:06:53,004 --> 01:06:55,209
He owned lots of land.

914
01:06:55,869 --> 01:06:57,296
He was timber merchant.

915
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,587
He also had this temple.

916
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,501
Temple of Dasbhuja
(goddess with ten hands). - Yes.

917
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:05,523
Mother Dasbhuja.

918
01:07:06,139 --> 01:07:08,085
Do you remember it?
- Yes.

919
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:12,756
Ram Dulal was a widower.

920
01:07:13,674 --> 01:07:17,533
His son and daughter-in-law had expired.

921
01:07:18,604 --> 01:07:21,221
He had no one in his
family except is grandson.

922
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:22,615
Gandharva Kumar?

923
01:07:23,924 --> 01:07:25,675
He was three months old at that time.

924
01:07:26,227 --> 01:07:27,286
He was not even named at that time.

925
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:35,041
"I'm Raju,
I'm unaware of my family background."

926
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:39,041
"I'm Raju,
I'm unaware of my family background."

927
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:43,495
"I stay where the river Ganges flow."

928
01:07:43,575 --> 01:07:47,722
"I'm Raju,
I'm unaware of my family background."

929
01:07:47,802 --> 01:07:51,873
"I stay where the river Ganges flow."

930
01:07:51,953 --> 01:07:54,035
"I'm Raju."

931
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:58,705
Genu da.. who named you?

932
01:08:00,684 --> 01:08:03,170
My father.. I mean my father's father.

933
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,592
I never saw my father.

934
01:08:06,057 --> 01:08:07,451
I called my grandpa father.

935
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,079
I heard that Arjun called
Bhishma father when he was small.

936
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:13,928
Did you hear the
Mahalaya in the morning?

937
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:15,658
I heard a small portion.

938
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,420
I woke up late.

939
01:08:17,874 --> 01:08:21,690
Did you hear it?
- I was on my way. - Way?

940
01:08:22,771 --> 01:08:24,760
I was riding on the boat to reach here.

941
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:26,782
Did you hear it on the boat?

942
01:08:27,691 --> 01:08:30,988
No, I didn't I heard the shehnai.
- Shehnai?

943
01:08:32,837 --> 01:08:38,848
A musical show was going on
in a huge house next to the river.

944
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,502
They were playing the
shehnai to celebrate the puja.

945
01:08:40,739 --> 01:08:42,231
But shehnai is generally
played during weddings.

946
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,405
Didn't you hear shehnai
played during the puja?

947
01:08:46,157 --> 01:08:50,005
When I woke up that morning I
saw that the rain clouds had dispersed.

948
01:08:50,491 --> 01:08:53,443
The sun was shining brightly
on the bamboo branches.

949
01:08:54,113 --> 01:08:58,264
On this holiday the shehnai
of puja can be heard in the distance.

950
01:08:58,762 --> 01:09:02,276
Three Indian mynas fight
on top of the roof over the kitchen.

951
01:09:02,892 --> 01:09:06,968
Beneath the idol of
Dasbhuja in the temple..

952
01:09:07,962 --> 01:09:09,562
..I found a wooden box one day.

953
01:09:11,704 --> 01:09:14,493
What was inside it?
- Gold coins.

954
01:09:15,477 --> 01:09:16,936
Lot of gold coins.

955
01:09:18,266 --> 01:09:20,979
I felt tempted at first.

956
01:09:21,715 --> 01:09:24,634
Then I realized that the
person who had given me shelter..

957
01:09:25,315 --> 01:09:27,034
..the person in whose
temple I found it..

958
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:29,899
..should be given those coins.

959
01:09:31,078 --> 01:09:34,548
Your mother agreed with me.
- But I didn't.

960
01:09:35,435 --> 01:09:38,722
How could he give away the
blessings of the goddess to a dacoit?

961
01:09:41,414 --> 01:09:42,743
I didn't listen to Panchu.

962
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:46,322
I did what my conscience told me.

963
01:09:47,219 --> 01:09:50,170
I don't regret it.

964
01:09:57,122 --> 01:10:00,863
Don't you feel bad Genu da?
- What?

965
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:03,976
You gave dada such a wonderful gift.

966
01:10:04,268 --> 01:10:05,933
You didn't give me anything.

967
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:07,825
I'm making this one for you.

968
01:10:09,328 --> 01:10:10,809
Really?
What's this?

969
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:13,382
You'll soon find out.

970
01:10:14,786 --> 01:10:18,127
How long will it take
- How long?

971
01:10:20,029 --> 01:10:23,327
It'll get done soon. Wait.
- Shall I go and stand next to dada?

972
01:10:35,252 --> 01:10:39,133
Wow ducks!
From where did the ducks come?

973
01:10:39,213 --> 01:10:44,008
From Siberia?
- No. they came from our house.

974
01:10:44,224 --> 01:10:47,737
You mean they are pets? Call them.

975
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:49,175
They won't come if I call them.

976
01:10:49,683 --> 01:10:50,840
They'll come if Panchu da calls them .

977
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,418
Then call Panchu da.

978
01:10:52,818 --> 01:10:54,191
They'll come if I call them.

979
01:10:54,505 --> 01:10:55,456
Do you want to check?

980
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:03,879
Oh! Look they are coming.

981
01:11:13,749 --> 01:11:15,544
Look at that. They are here.

982
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:25,566
Where did you learn this?
- Egypt.

983
01:11:27,392 --> 01:11:31,727
Where did I learn this? - Where?
- In the country of Holland.

984
01:11:31,807 --> 01:11:33,068
Holland?
- Yes.

985
01:11:34,095 --> 01:11:35,555
There are many windmills there.

986
01:11:36,528 --> 01:11:38,171
They gave me the idea.

987
01:11:38,251 --> 01:11:41,695
But, it's not moving.
- It'll move.

988
01:11:41,955 --> 01:11:43,760
There's no wind right now,
so it isn't moving.

989
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,599
How do we get wind?

990
01:11:46,193 --> 01:11:47,253
You want wind?

991
01:11:48,593 --> 01:11:49,587
Let's run.

992
01:12:00,798 --> 01:12:04,160
The news of the secret treasure
of Ram Dulal didn't remain a secret.

993
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:08,701
It was the last night of Pitripaksha.
Mahalaya.

994
01:12:09,274 --> 01:12:11,079
Dacoits attacked Ram Dulal's house.

995
01:12:11,836 --> 01:12:14,733
Ram Dulal brought the
gold coins to me and said..

996
01:12:15,241 --> 01:12:16,538
.. "Keep these gold coins with you."

997
01:12:17,165 --> 01:12:18,549
"I'll come back and take them."

998
01:12:19,111 --> 01:12:22,300
"If I can't come,
my grandson will come."

999
01:12:23,532 --> 01:12:25,446
"Give him his property."

1000
01:12:26,764 --> 01:12:29,315
But how will I recognize him?

1001
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:33,154
He showed the diamond
ring on his fingers and said..

1002
01:12:33,846 --> 01:12:35,121
"He'll wear this."

1003
01:12:35,878 --> 01:12:41,381
"He'll say that Ram
Dulal's grandson is here."

1004
01:12:43,089 --> 01:12:45,294
The dacoits were shouting loudly.

1005
01:12:45,575 --> 01:12:48,981
Their burning torches
turned the sky crimson.

1006
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,666
As Ram Dulal escaped
through the backdoor..

1007
01:12:52,746 --> 01:12:56,461
..he looked back and said,
"My grandson will definitely come..

1008
01:12:57,088 --> 01:13:00,029
..he'll come on the day of Mahalaya."

1009
01:13:00,223 --> 01:13:02,850
Where are the gold coins?
- They are with me.

1010
01:13:03,877 --> 01:13:07,780
I spent few when I made this house.

1011
01:13:08,406 --> 01:13:13,812
So, this house,
the furniture legally belongs to him.

1012
01:13:13,892 --> 01:13:16,309
If you don't give the boy anything?

1013
01:13:16,655 --> 01:13:18,179
That's impossible.
- No. No.

1014
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,352
He isn't suggesting
that you deprive him .

1015
01:13:20,633 --> 01:13:21,292
He wants to say that..

1016
01:13:21,372 --> 01:13:24,871
Ram Dulal had two guards..
Swet and Lohit.

1017
01:13:26,092 --> 01:13:28,567
They come on every night
of Mahalaya to find out..

1018
01:13:29,713 --> 01:13:30,827
..if anyone had come.

1019
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,534
We never saw them.
- Panchu knows about them.

1020
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:39,129
Their condition was that
they would come at night..

1021
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,562
..utter the hint sentence,
show the diamond ring..

1022
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,216
..and Swet and Lohit will identify him.

1023
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,368
We aren't bound return he property
until Swet and Lohit identifies him.

1024
01:13:51,596 --> 01:13:53,974
But, I'm bound.
- Why are you bound?

1025
01:13:55,023 --> 01:13:58,244
I'm bound to my conscience.
To my religion.

1026
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:03,996
I know that Swet and
Lohit will come at night.

1027
01:14:04,299 --> 01:14:06,126
Well, how do you put it?

1028
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:08,710
No one except you knew about this. If..

1029
01:14:08,893 --> 01:14:11,337
You mean if I died?

1030
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:14,991
I'm not yet dead.

1031
01:14:15,932 --> 01:14:19,748
I was not supposed to wait forever.

1032
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:24,537
Ram Dulal said that if no
one came here within thirty years..

1033
01:14:25,034 --> 01:14:26,688
..then the property would be mine.

1034
01:14:27,121 --> 01:14:29,207
How long is it before thirty years?

1035
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:33,553
Thirty years gets over today.

1036
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:41,888
Are you tired?

1037
01:14:43,099 --> 01:14:45,401
Do you ride the horse?

1038
01:14:46,147 --> 01:14:47,196
Why do you ask this question?

1039
01:14:47,877 --> 01:14:54,623
You are a prince.
- Oh! I never rode a horse.

1040
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:57,305
You told me in the morning.

1041
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:00,548
It was someone else.

1042
01:15:02,342 --> 01:15:04,147
A traveller from far.

1043
01:15:06,017 --> 01:15:09,055
I'm your Genu da. Let's go.

1044
01:15:09,898 --> 01:15:11,931
Let's go back. It's been long.

1045
01:15:12,384 --> 01:15:13,466
Call Tinni.

1046
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:19,509
Tinni! Tinni!

1047
01:15:20,146 --> 01:15:21,790
Come on, let's go home.

1048
01:15:23,023 --> 01:15:26,266
I've decided to shift from here.

1049
01:15:27,088 --> 01:15:28,320
What about Habul's school?

1050
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,914
There'll be a school wherever we shift.

1051
01:15:31,217 --> 01:15:34,049
It'll be difficult to get
admission in the middle of the year.

1052
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:36,579
I didn't call you to
discuss Habul's problems.

1053
01:15:37,249 --> 01:15:40,903
I had decided.. no I've decided that..

1054
01:15:41,649 --> 01:15:43,270
..I'll ask two days time from him.

1055
01:15:43,735 --> 01:15:45,768
What next?
- What?

1056
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,162
We'll have to leave the house and go.

1057
01:15:51,075 --> 01:15:51,940
What about the puja?

1058
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,399
It'll get stalled.

1059
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:58,037
Tell Bhupen and the drummers..
- I'll see to it.

1060
01:15:58,946 --> 01:16:00,113
What's this?

1061
01:16:00,849 --> 01:16:02,849
Why isn't there no
lights near the oddses?

1062
01:16:04,069 --> 01:16:07,594
Bhupen da..
- Bhupen da has gone.

1063
01:16:12,275 --> 01:16:14,080
Why? Is he sick?

1064
01:16:15,648 --> 01:16:16,891
Father told him to go.

1065
01:16:17,734 --> 01:16:21,205
Who'll make the idol?
- I'll tell you.

1066
01:16:23,335 --> 01:16:26,708
Tinni, your mother is looking for you.
Go to her.

1067
01:16:27,897 --> 01:16:30,405
You go and rest in your room.
- No. it's ok.

1068
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:33,541
You'll have to stay awake
throughout the night. - Why?

1069
01:16:34,081 --> 01:16:35,454
Will he make the idol?

1070
01:16:35,534 --> 01:16:36,416
I'll tell you everything. Wait.

1071
01:16:37,756 --> 01:16:38,675
Please go.

1072
01:16:49,339 --> 01:16:50,680
What's wrong, Chotka?

1073
01:17:22,767 --> 01:17:25,384
Mother.. when will the drummers leave?

1074
01:17:25,913 --> 01:17:26,767
Tomorrow.

1075
01:17:27,264 --> 01:17:29,189
When will we leave?
- I don't know.

1076
01:17:29,773 --> 01:17:31,535
Your father and Chotka will
go in search of a house tomorrow

1077
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:36,313
Shall I serve dinner to Tinni?

1078
01:17:38,247 --> 01:17:39,685
Shall I serve dinner to Tinni?

1079
01:17:42,647 --> 01:17:45,771
Sister, do you've any
medicine for headache?

1080
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:47,134
I'll check.

1081
01:17:47,214 --> 01:17:48,604
Shall I get tea for you?

1082
01:17:51,523 --> 01:17:53,058
I think I'll go and get shower.

1083
01:18:06,324 --> 01:18:07,578
She is asleep.

1084
01:18:07,945 --> 01:18:08,810
Won't she have dinner?

1085
01:18:09,005 --> 01:18:11,059
Tinni, aunt is calling you.

1086
01:18:11,308 --> 01:18:12,226
Go and have dinner.

1087
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:15,956
Tinni, don't be naughty.
Go and have dinner.

1088
01:18:16,443 --> 01:18:17,416
Don't scold her.

1089
01:18:17,496 --> 01:18:19,167
I'll get milk for her.

1090
01:18:45,134 --> 01:18:47,999
Who is singing?
- Biru.

1091
01:18:52,605 --> 01:18:55,978
No.. this isn't Biru's voice.

1092
01:18:56,497 --> 01:18:57,794
I think it's Gandharva.

1093
01:18:58,129 --> 01:19:04,345
"She takes Mother's name and cries."

1094
01:19:04,853 --> 01:19:11,059
"Giri go and bring Gauri."

1095
01:19:11,351 --> 01:19:15,881
"Uma is very sad."

1096
01:19:18,779 --> 01:19:25,482
"Your son-in-law is a beggar."

1097
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:32,584
"My daughter Gauri
lived a luxurious life."

1098
01:19:32,664 --> 01:19:39,308
"Your son-in-law is a beggar."

1099
01:19:40,183 --> 01:19:45,686
"My daughter Gauri
lived a luxurious life."

1100
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:51,827
"All the belongings of Uma.."

1101
01:19:52,475 --> 01:20:04,248
"All the belongings of Uma
were sold by Bhola for drugs."

1102
01:20:05,101 --> 01:20:10,907
"Giri go and bring Gauri."

1103
01:20:11,879 --> 01:20:17,252
"Uma is very sad."

1104
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:26,431
"Bhola is addicted to bhang
(drink made from cannabis)."

1105
01:20:26,852 --> 01:20:32,604
"He has all the bhang
from all the three worlds."

1106
01:20:32,684 --> 01:20:38,809
"Bhola is addicted to bhang."

1107
01:20:39,285 --> 01:20:44,971
"He has all the bhang
from all the three worlds."

1108
01:20:45,051 --> 01:20:50,561
"The seeds of Dhutra (devil's
trumpet) and the powder of bhang.."

1109
01:20:50,983 --> 01:20:56,821
"The seeds of Dhutra
and the powder of bhang.."

1110
01:20:57,437 --> 01:21:02,972
"..are smeared on Uma's body by Bhola."

1111
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:09,513
"Giri go and bring Gauri."

1112
01:21:09,945 --> 01:21:14,778
"Uma is very sad."

1113
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:24,497
What will be the name of the episode?

1114
01:21:25,308 --> 01:21:28,216
'The theft of the ring'.
- No.

1115
01:21:34,302 --> 01:21:35,675
The terror.

1116
01:21:37,816 --> 01:21:43,707
I'll attack Ratan Lal Banerjee's house,
steal the ring..

1117
01:21:45,307 --> 01:21:49,977
..sell it in the market
and form the gang of robbers.

1118
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:53,685
The story will be different
after you reach there.

1119
01:21:53,858 --> 01:21:56,691
You'll go there,
get caught and will be imprisoned.

1120
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:01,859
Well, the you can't fool
the dog by going there in disguise.

1121
01:22:02,249 --> 01:22:03,330
They can smell a person.

1122
01:22:04,206 --> 01:22:05,406
I've news that he doesn't.

1123
01:22:05,849 --> 01:22:06,746
The dog has become old.

1124
01:22:07,017 --> 01:22:08,250
He dozes off in the evening.

1125
01:22:08,563 --> 01:22:10,877
You never saw him that way.
- No, I didn't.

1126
01:22:12,823 --> 01:22:15,266
Gopi da, give me the
mosquito spray that you have.

1127
01:22:15,346 --> 01:22:16,347
What will you do with it?

1128
01:22:16,427 --> 01:22:18,595
I'll spray it and he'll lie unconscious.

1129
01:22:19,298 --> 01:22:22,228
Think again if you are
ready to take this risk.

1130
01:22:27,915 --> 01:22:30,931
Gopi da, you've read many books.

1131
01:22:31,839 --> 01:22:33,839
What's the value of human life?

1132
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:36,617
My grandma used to say that
human life is worth very les.

1133
01:22:38,737 --> 01:22:44,856
And this ring.. the real
one costs around 2,00,000 rupees.

1134
01:22:45,494 --> 01:22:46,553
You won't get killed.

1135
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:49,526
You'll get caught and
thrashed badly by Panchu.

1136
01:22:51,385 --> 01:22:53,234
Did you hear of Putli Bai,
the dacoit from Chambal?

1137
01:22:53,871 --> 01:22:55,168
She didn't have a hand.

1138
01:22:57,017 --> 01:23:00,866
Sashti Sardar will lose a leg. Right?

1139
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:05,255
Sashti Sardar?
No. that's not a good name.

1140
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:08,725
Gopi da,
think of a powerful name for me..

1141
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:11,676
..when I go to steal the ring.

1142
01:23:22,594 --> 01:23:24,756
Why should you stay awake for them?

1143
01:23:26,162 --> 01:23:27,329
I'll call you if they come.

1144
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:28,432
You sleep.

1145
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:33,957
12:30
- They are never so late.

1146
01:23:35,384 --> 01:23:36,519
They are waiting.

1147
01:23:36,865 --> 01:23:38,195
They'll come when everybody is asleep.

1148
01:23:40,184 --> 01:23:41,438
Haven't they gone to bed?

1149
01:23:43,027 --> 01:23:44,303
The main door is closed.

1150
01:23:45,082 --> 01:23:46,314
I've tied up Jimmy.

1151
01:23:48,487 --> 01:23:54,497
If we shift..
it'll be difficult for Jimmy. Isn't it?

1152
01:23:55,383 --> 01:23:57,091
How are you, Mr. Ratan?

1153
01:23:59,632 --> 01:24:00,680
Why are you alone?

1154
01:24:01,805 --> 01:24:03,448
Where is Lohit?
- He didn't come.

1155
01:24:05,534 --> 01:24:08,712
The condition was that both
of you'll identify him together.

1156
01:24:09,015 --> 01:24:10,615
Lohit will never come.

1157
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:12,236
He is dead.

1158
01:24:13,036 --> 01:24:14,020
What's the proof?

1159
01:24:43,794 --> 01:24:44,735
What's this?

1160
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:47,599
This is the death certificate
of someone called Lal Chand Barai.

1161
01:24:47,773 --> 01:24:49,557
That's Lohit's real name.

1162
01:24:53,179 --> 01:24:55,644
I must investigate the matter.

1163
01:24:56,563 --> 01:24:58,563
I'll keep the death certificate with me.

1164
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:02,369
Kumar will also stay here.

1165
01:25:03,937 --> 01:25:05,969
Come and meet me after seven days.

1166
01:25:09,007 --> 01:25:10,737
You were a priest Ratan Lal.

1167
01:25:11,688 --> 01:25:13,137
Since when did you become a lawyer?

1168
01:25:13,217 --> 01:25:15,839
Don't act smart.
You are a religious man.

1169
01:25:18,887 --> 01:25:21,579
Will dacoits like you
decide what he should do?

1170
01:25:25,925 --> 01:25:27,330
Panchu..

1171
01:25:31,374 --> 01:25:32,736
Call Kumar.

1172
01:25:33,266 --> 01:25:35,947
And get the keys of the safe.

1173
01:25:42,812 --> 01:25:45,115
Chotka. Chotka.

1174
01:25:46,044 --> 01:25:47,417
Yes, tell me, I'm awake.

1175
01:25:47,796 --> 01:25:49,071
They've come.

1176
01:25:52,509 --> 01:25:54,272
Both of them?
- No. One of them.

1177
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:57,309
Where?
- Under the tree.

1178
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,466
Under the tree?

1179
01:26:03,785 --> 01:26:05,525
Where is your Genu da?
- He is over there.

1180
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:09,320
Let's go.

1181
01:26:31,071 --> 01:26:33,341
Kumar, utter the hint sentence.

1182
01:26:39,709 --> 01:26:45,125
There's nectar in the sunshine,
nectar in the water, nectar in the wind.

1183
01:26:45,785 --> 01:26:48,368
Let the darkness of the
new moon night be erased.

1184
01:26:48,887 --> 01:26:50,823
Let Kumar's coronation take place.

1185
01:26:55,472 --> 01:26:59,808
I've carried a heavy burden
since the past thirty years.

1186
01:27:00,478 --> 01:27:02,954
You've relieved me from that burden.

1187
01:27:03,365 --> 01:27:05,257
May the Goddess bless you.

1188
01:27:06,111 --> 01:27:10,986
I've a request.
- Yes, tell me.

1189
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:15,104
Give me two days' time.

1190
01:27:15,947 --> 01:27:17,774
I'll leave this house
day after tomorrow and go away.

1191
01:27:18,023 --> 01:27:20,596
This was not mentioned
in the terms and conditions.

1192
01:27:21,634 --> 01:27:23,320
Many terms were not mentioned.

1193
01:27:24,045 --> 01:27:26,034
For example you were
not supposed to come alone.

1194
01:27:26,114 --> 01:27:29,256
Panchu! Go and get the safe.

1195
01:27:35,154 --> 01:27:40,473
I've a request.
- Yes, tell me.

1196
01:27:41,013 --> 01:27:42,462
Go away after the puja.

1197
01:27:43,154 --> 01:27:47,348
The children will be very
sad if you don't celebrate the puja.

1198
01:27:48,407 --> 01:27:49,921
I told you that he is a nice person.

1199
01:27:50,818 --> 01:27:52,580
Then why does he keep bad company?

1200
01:27:53,207 --> 01:27:54,894
I can't keep this request of yours.

1201
01:27:57,337 --> 01:28:01,218
If you want to celebrate the puja,
there won't be any problem.

1202
01:28:02,397 --> 01:28:03,976
The drummers have not left yet.

1203
01:28:04,549 --> 01:28:06,624
I'll inform Bhupen tomorrow morning.

1204
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,630
All the other arrangements are in place.

1205
01:28:10,419 --> 01:28:11,652
Will Habul and Tinni attend it?

1206
01:28:12,743 --> 01:28:14,116
I won't stop them.

1207
01:28:24,602 --> 01:28:27,845
Kumar, this is the
nose ring of the Goddess.

1208
01:28:28,656 --> 01:28:32,656
We had vowed that we would deck the
Goddess with it during the veneration.

1209
01:28:36,212 --> 01:28:43,304
This is your grandfather's
property which he entrusted to me.

1210
01:28:44,072 --> 01:28:45,185
Thank you.

1211
01:29:11,814 --> 01:29:14,019
Chotka look,
there are lots of gold coins.

1212
01:29:15,111 --> 01:29:16,840
It'll take the entire
night to count them.

1213
01:29:17,598 --> 01:29:19,782
Take a bowl from the kitchen.

1214
01:29:20,084 --> 01:29:21,555
It'll help you count them faster.

1215
01:29:22,808 --> 01:29:24,138
Shall I smear some gum on the bowl.

1216
01:29:25,306 --> 01:29:26,149
How will that help?

1217
01:29:26,229 --> 01:29:27,501
The gold coin that'll
stick on it will be enough..

1218
01:29:27,581 --> 01:29:28,928
..to bear the expenses of the puja.
Isn't it, Chotka?

1219
01:29:32,182 --> 01:29:36,572
It'll help but think
of Ali Baba's story.

1220
01:29:38,085 --> 01:29:41,220
Do you like the people who cheat?

1221
01:30:04,984 --> 01:30:07,211
Look at the room they've allotted you.

1222
01:30:09,535 --> 01:30:12,778
The stairs are too steep.

1223
01:30:17,644 --> 01:30:18,725
Is it too heavy?

1224
01:30:20,065 --> 01:30:21,481
I'll slap you hard.

1225
01:30:21,989 --> 01:30:23,384
Rogue!

1226
01:30:25,157 --> 01:30:26,368
Why are you getting excited?

1227
01:30:27,059 --> 01:30:30,021
Don't pretend. Why am I getting excited?

1228
01:30:31,373 --> 01:30:35,914
Your use of chaste Bengali and
request to stay back until the puja.

1229
01:30:37,427 --> 01:30:38,659
What if he had agreed?

1230
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,421
So what?

1231
01:30:40,972 --> 01:30:42,302
You've waited for a long time.

1232
01:30:42,626 --> 01:30:45,037
It wouldn't have hurt
if you waited for ten days.

1233
01:30:45,859 --> 01:30:47,480
How would it have helped you?

1234
01:30:48,994 --> 01:30:50,864
The children would've enjoyed.

1235
01:30:50,944 --> 01:30:52,140
They shouldn't enjoy so much.

1236
01:30:52,334 --> 01:30:53,643
They've exams when the school re-opens.

1237
01:30:53,826 --> 01:30:55,037
Let them study.

1238
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:59,340
Where will they study? Under the tree?

1239
01:31:00,335 --> 01:31:01,935
The house belongs to you now.

1240
01:31:03,395 --> 01:31:04,908
Don't give lectures.

1241
01:31:05,817 --> 01:31:06,811
I gave you ten rupees yesterday.

1242
01:31:06,891 --> 01:31:08,174
Give me the details of your expenses.

1243
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:11,967
The boat ride cost me
one rupee and four annas. - Ok.

1244
01:31:12,746 --> 01:31:14,703
The rickshaw fare from station
to the banks two and half rupees.

1245
01:31:14,783 --> 01:31:15,935
Look at your tantrums.

1246
01:31:16,455 --> 01:31:17,514
Why did you ride a rickshaw?

1247
01:31:17,785 --> 01:31:18,768
Why didn't you walk?

1248
01:31:19,633 --> 01:31:22,476
I started walking but I got blisters
on my foot because of the shoes.

1249
01:31:23,202 --> 01:31:24,585
Sticking plaster cost me 60 paise.

1250
01:31:25,709 --> 01:31:30,077
One rupee four annas,
two and half rupees adds upto..

1251
01:31:30,455 --> 01:31:32,920
..three rupees seventy five paise.

1252
01:31:34,195 --> 01:31:36,022
What else?
- 60 paise.

1253
01:31:36,974 --> 01:31:38,541
I got the shoes repaired.

1254
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:41,590
It cost me 50 paise.
- 50 paise.

1255
01:31:42,445 --> 01:31:43,656
Is he a dacoit?

1256
01:31:45,634 --> 01:31:48,185
I forgot to ask him his name.

1257
01:31:48,607 --> 01:31:50,715
That would've helped you
to find out if he is your relative.

1258
01:31:52,012 --> 01:32:00,164
60 and 50 is 1 rupee 10. Ok.

1259
01:32:03,764 --> 01:32:04,510
Why did you return one and half rupee.

1260
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:05,732
I bought a packet of cigarettes.

1261
01:32:06,099 --> 01:32:07,407
If you've any problem
then deduct it from my share.

1262
01:32:08,034 --> 01:32:09,645
Share?
- Yes.

1263
01:32:10,456 --> 01:32:12,186
My remuneration.
- Remuneration?

1264
01:32:12,769 --> 01:32:14,055
I'm the one who toiled hard.

1265
01:32:14,293 --> 01:32:16,077
I carried the heavy safe upstairs.

1266
01:32:18,574 --> 01:32:19,817
What about my acting?

1267
01:32:20,142 --> 01:32:21,374
That's not hard work.

1268
01:32:21,731 --> 01:32:23,115
You came dressed in expensive clothes.

1269
01:32:23,547 --> 01:32:26,185
Had good food and went
out for walk in the evening.

1270
01:32:27,191 --> 01:32:28,380
You've a good sense of humor.

1271
01:32:29,245 --> 01:32:32,856
But, humor at this hour
of the night isn't acceptable.

1272
01:32:33,872 --> 01:32:34,823
We had decided that you would pay for..

1273
01:32:34,903 --> 01:32:35,602
..my travel expenses to Bombay.

1274
01:32:35,682 --> 01:32:37,050
I didn't agree to
any terms and conditions.

1275
01:32:37,753 --> 01:32:38,628
Where is Mr. Lohit?

1276
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:40,163
I hit him on the head with the stick.

1277
01:32:40,769 --> 01:32:42,152
To hell with your terms and conditions.

1278
01:32:42,412 --> 01:32:44,325
If I give you a share
I won't be left with anything.

1279
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:49,676
I didn't come here to steal.

1280
01:32:50,076 --> 01:32:52,000
I came here to steal that man's ring.

1281
01:32:52,606 --> 01:32:53,914
Why did you wear this moustache?

1282
01:32:54,573 --> 01:32:57,211
Do you think we can't
recognize you? Fool!

1283
01:32:58,487 --> 01:33:00,130
It becomes a problem
if I come in disguise.

1284
01:33:00,347 --> 01:33:01,968
What about that man?

1285
01:33:02,142 --> 01:33:04,131
You heard everything.
- Right!

1286
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:06,271
What shall I do now?

1287
01:33:06,509 --> 01:33:08,671
Listen, go and inform
your family members.

1288
01:33:08,952 --> 01:33:10,379
I'll keep an eye on them.
- Ok.

1289
01:33:12,423 --> 01:33:14,240
Don't unleash the dog.

1290
01:33:30,413 --> 01:33:31,223
Stop!

1291
01:33:32,478 --> 01:33:33,732
Let me go, Panchu.

1292
01:33:34,964 --> 01:33:36,218
Keep the gold coins here.

1293
01:33:36,672 --> 01:33:37,905
The gold coins are mine.

1294
01:33:38,207 --> 01:33:40,035
Ratan Lal has given them to me.

1295
01:33:40,218 --> 01:33:41,570
He didn't give it to you.

1296
01:33:42,164 --> 01:33:44,067
I won't stop the person
to whom they were given.

1297
01:33:44,898 --> 01:33:46,649
Don't try to challenge me, Panchu.

1298
01:33:47,925 --> 01:33:49,482
You won't be alive.

1299
01:33:50,628 --> 01:33:52,185
Let me check how strong you are.

1300
01:34:52,444 --> 01:34:55,320
Who hit you? Who scolded you?

1301
01:34:55,752 --> 01:34:58,920
That's why the child is
angry and didn't eat yesterday.

1302
01:35:01,838 --> 01:35:04,487
I'm speaking in Bengali.
Isn't it Bengali?

1303
01:35:07,277 --> 01:35:12,066
Look, I've real diamond.

1304
01:35:12,801 --> 01:35:16,304
Come on tell me which one is real.

1305
01:35:16,384 --> 01:35:18,628
This or that?

1306
01:35:24,379 --> 01:35:26,077
Chotka has caught that man.
Come quickly.

1307
01:36:30,986 --> 01:36:32,402
Get a rope quickly.

1308
01:36:33,332 --> 01:36:34,532
Here you go, sir.

1309
01:36:36,672 --> 01:36:39,083
What else do you've in your bag?

1310
01:36:39,861 --> 01:36:40,759
I've this too.

1311
01:36:40,839 --> 01:36:42,305
Apply it on your wounds.

1312
01:36:43,634 --> 01:36:44,813
I'll take that later.

1313
01:36:45,483 --> 01:36:47,202
Take care of Panchu da.

1314
01:37:03,536 --> 01:37:04,553
Hey!

1315
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:09,990
I know a herb which cans top blood loss.

1316
01:37:10,444 --> 01:37:14,401
Wait. Have you started practicing
medicine, Sashti Charan?

1317
01:37:15,481 --> 01:37:18,043
Biru, bring Panchhu to my room.

1318
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:21,103
Bishu, call the doctor.

1319
01:37:27,481 --> 01:37:29,946
From who did you take music lessons?

1320
01:37:35,243 --> 01:37:36,443
I'm self-trained.

1321
01:37:36,993 --> 01:37:45,631
Music, magic, call of ducks,
I'm self-trained. - Egypt?

1322
01:37:46,290 --> 01:37:49,382
Besides my village
school was a huge pond.

1323
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:52,322
Lots of ducks would swim on it.

1324
01:37:53,187 --> 01:37:54,549
I never paid attention
to what the teachers taught..

1325
01:37:55,446 --> 01:37:56,797
..during the afternoon classes.

1326
01:37:57,122 --> 01:37:59,003
I would be busy hearing
the quacking sound of ducks.

1327
01:37:59,534 --> 01:38:04,874
The one day I realized that
I could imitate their voice. - Ok.

1328
01:38:05,577 --> 01:38:08,031
Well, I've travelled only
till the city in my district.

1329
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:12,550
I've travelled the world
only with the help of books.

1330
01:38:13,469 --> 01:38:17,339
How would you travel to Bombay?

1331
01:38:17,609 --> 01:38:19,718
You also stay in a different village.

1332
01:38:20,128 --> 01:38:21,145
Didn't I manage to reach here?

1333
01:38:21,225 --> 01:38:23,166
This is a small village.

1334
01:38:23,643 --> 01:38:25,567
That's a huge city.

1335
01:38:26,324 --> 01:38:29,156
It's not an easy task
to become a film actor.

1336
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:32,518
Why? Didn't you like my acting?
- Yes.

1337
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,567
Why did you take this huge risk.

1338
01:38:35,901 --> 01:38:40,128
He promised to pay my
travel expenses to Bombay..

1339
01:38:40,528 --> 01:38:41,901
..and the expenses
of few days stay there..

1340
01:38:42,096 --> 01:38:43,620
..if I played the role of a prince
and help him recover his lost property.

1341
01:38:44,507 --> 01:38:50,701
You were about to ruin our
lives for such a small sum of money?

1342
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:53,025
He told me everything.

1343
01:38:53,566 --> 01:38:55,382
He described your house
situated on a vast land,

1344
01:38:55,462 --> 01:38:59,447
The temple of the goddess, the
safe filled with gold coins. everything.

1345
01:39:00,301 --> 01:39:04,572
He didn't mention the
children Habul and Tinni to me.

1346
01:39:06,193 --> 01:39:08,031
But, this experience has helped me.

1347
01:39:08,658 --> 01:39:10,485
I got the chance
to meet Habul and Tinni.

1348
01:39:11,285 --> 01:39:13,479
Do you know the cost
of the ring on your finger?

1349
01:39:14,636 --> 01:39:15,955
I don't know the exact value.

1350
01:39:16,035 --> 01:39:17,112
But, I know it's expensive.

1351
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,220
You could've sold it an gone to Bombay.

1352
01:39:19,511 --> 01:39:21,760
You wouldn't have
to take so much trouble.

1353
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:25,879
An actor never sells his accessories
when the show is going on..

1354
01:39:26,322 --> 01:39:27,532
..even if it's expensive.

1355
01:39:28,678 --> 01:39:30,148
This was a part of my prince's get up.

1356
01:39:31,132 --> 01:39:34,991
I had promised to return him
the ring after the work gets done.

1357
01:39:35,543 --> 01:39:38,603
You don't have to.
Keep the ring with you.

1358
01:39:39,414 --> 01:39:40,463
It's my order.

1359
01:39:40,895 --> 01:39:42,106
I didn't wish to win a lottery.

1360
01:39:42,355 --> 01:39:45,792
I wanted to earn with my acting skills.

1361
01:39:47,696 --> 01:39:49,220
What shall you do?

1362
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:50,712
You take the decision.

1363
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:52,107
Sorry, father.

1364
01:39:52,485 --> 01:39:55,015
I can't suggest anything in this regard.

1365
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:57,901
I'm still confused.

1366
01:39:58,744 --> 01:40:01,133
I'll tell you whatever
I heard from Lohit.

1367
01:40:02,302 --> 01:40:05,556
Ram Dulal and his
grandson are not alive.

1368
01:40:06,735 --> 01:40:10,032
They took shelter in a deep
forest after escaping from home.

1369
01:40:10,659 --> 01:40:13,816
They were afflicted
with a serious ailment..

1370
01:40:14,562 --> 01:40:16,421
..after being bitten
by some poisonous insect.

1371
01:40:16,865 --> 01:40:19,135
They died after few days.

1372
01:40:19,946 --> 01:40:23,871
Swet and Lohit had taken
care of them before they died.

1373
01:40:24,693 --> 01:40:29,492
So, before death Ram Dulal
gave this diamond ring to them.

1374
01:40:30,671 --> 01:40:34,379
Since that day they searched
someone who could play the role..

1375
01:40:34,865 --> 01:40:37,957
..of Ram Dulal's grandson.

1376
01:40:39,190 --> 01:40:41,330
Finally they met me.

1377
01:40:41,772 --> 01:40:43,070
I am actor.

1378
01:40:44,269 --> 01:40:46,584
Since childhood I had
a dream to go to Bombay..

1379
01:40:46,664 --> 01:40:47,935
..and become a film actor.

1380
01:40:48,194 --> 01:40:51,308
Why did you learn chaste
Bengali instead of Hindi?

1381
01:40:52,086 --> 01:40:53,448
This is also a part of my acting.

1382
01:40:53,924 --> 01:40:58,486
I used some difficult words
as I was playing the part of a prince.

1383
01:41:01,946 --> 01:41:05,837
Great! You've everything in your bag.

1384
01:41:07,653 --> 01:41:10,864
I've everything except money.

1385
01:41:10,944 --> 01:41:17,405
Oh! Here is the papers of the
house and the nose ring of the goddess.

1386
01:41:19,394 --> 01:41:22,129
Now it's up to you to decide
if you want me to get arrested.

1387
01:41:23,264 --> 01:41:25,232
The Devipksha (the period when people
surrender to Goddess) starts from today.

1388
01:41:26,096 --> 01:41:28,778
I don't want anyone
to go away from my house..

1389
01:41:30,378 --> 01:41:31,437
..with unfulfilled wishes.

1390
01:41:31,902 --> 01:41:35,675
Father.. we can leave him.

1391
01:41:39,263 --> 01:41:40,885
I announced my decision.

1392
01:41:40,965 --> 01:41:43,188
Do what you this is right.

1393
01:41:43,707 --> 01:41:46,247
It's time for Panchu's medicine.
I'll have to go now.

1394
01:42:01,318 --> 01:42:05,199
Mr. Gandharva Kumar..
- My name is Dilip Kumar Biswas.

1395
01:42:06,756 --> 01:42:09,458
Do something. Come with me.
- Where?

1396
01:42:09,815 --> 01:42:12,150
I'll make arrangements
for your travel to Bombay.

1397
01:42:18,162 --> 01:42:21,675
Brother-in-law,
he must leave after having breakfast.

1398
01:42:22,346 --> 01:42:23,513
Thank you sister-in-law.

1399
01:42:23,913 --> 01:42:29,264
Excuse me, change your
name after you got to Bombay.

1400
01:42:30,886 --> 01:42:33,794
Which name?
Dilip Kumar or Gandharva Kumar?

1401
01:43:10,033 --> 01:43:13,136
Genu da, won't you come here again?

1402
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:15,504
Yes, I will

1403
01:43:17,731 --> 01:43:20,099
On the day of Mahalaya.
- Sure?

1404
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:22,358
Of course.

1405
01:43:23,472 --> 01:43:24,942
I hope you won't forget your promise.

1406
01:43:26,607 --> 01:43:27,731
No. I won't.

1407
01:43:28,617 --> 01:43:33,547
I give this to you so
that you don't forget me.

1408
01:43:45,387 --> 01:43:48,381
Token?
- That's not the fake one.

1409
01:43:48,619 --> 01:43:49,700
That's the real diamond ring.

1410
01:43:50,338 --> 01:43:51,949
I've the real one with me.

1411
01:43:53,484 --> 01:43:54,424
Bye.

1412
01:44:43,613 --> 01:44:44,954
Chotka, you?

1413
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:48,327
I was waiting for you. Let's go.

1414
01:44:52,197 --> 01:44:54,792
Chotka, Swet was a muscular man.

1415
01:44:55,181 --> 01:44:56,683
How did you manage to pin him down?

1416
01:44:57,538 --> 01:44:58,770
He is a bad man.

1417
01:44:59,483 --> 01:45:01,040
He was fighting because he was greedy.

1418
01:45:02,025 --> 01:45:03,614
I was fighting in self-defense.

1419
01:45:04,187 --> 01:45:05,549
I was fighting to save everybody.

1420
01:45:05,927 --> 01:45:07,906
Oh! Just like Sabyasachi.

1421
01:45:11,452 --> 01:45:12,954
I could because I exercise daily.

1422
01:45:15,613 --> 01:45:16,586
From tomorrow.

1423
01:45:30,284 --> 01:45:31,754
It's time to make
offerings to the goddess.

1424
01:45:32,067 --> 01:45:33,505
Take flowers.

1425
01:46:17,414 --> 01:46:19,447
Salutations to the
Supreme powerful Goddess.

1426
01:46:19,771 --> 01:46:21,566
Salutations to the
Supreme powerful Goddess.

1427
01:46:21,879 --> 01:46:23,501
The goddess decked
with garland of heads.

1428
01:46:23,581 --> 01:46:25,393
The goddess decked
with garland of heads.

1429
01:46:25,473 --> 01:46:27,436
One who saves us from evil.

1430
01:46:27,516 --> 01:46:29,393
One who saves us from evil.

1431
01:46:29,473 --> 01:46:31,242
With a scepter in her hands.

1432
01:46:31,322 --> 01:46:32,950
With a scepter in her hands.

1433
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:37,112
Let's offer flowers
to you dipped in sandalwood.
