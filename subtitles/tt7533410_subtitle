1
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,417
'He is Sethu.'

2
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,917
'For the past few days,
he has been doubting...'

3
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,125
'whether he is the avatar of God,
or not.'

4
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,250
'In this story, we will get to know'

5
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,292
'if he is really an avatar.'
- Sethu!

6
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,125
Sethu, come upstairs.

7
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,458
You still haven't brushed
your teeth.

8
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,542
King Parikshit asks sage Shuka...

9
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,500
'You told everything
about the two dynasties.'

10
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:21,375
He said, 'You revealed
the history about the kings'

11
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,583
'from Soma dynasty
and Surya dynasty.'

12
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,625
He asked King Parikshit
if it wasn't interesting.

13
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,375
He said, 'You skipped
the story of Lord Krishna.'

14
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,792
That's because Lord Krishna
took an avatar.

15
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:38,750
King Parikshit wanted
to hear His story in detail.

16
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,042
Because Lord Krishna took birth
in the family of a cow grazer.

17
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,375
He worked as a cow grazer.

18
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,917
Getting inspired by
Lord Krishna's story,

19
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,458
he wanted to know about Him.
- Meera.

20
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,583
Because he was...
- Meera, wake up.

21
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,792
Lord Krishna will take birth...
- Sister.

22
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,458
Lord Krishna will be born
in a low-income family,

23
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:02,125
but will rule the world.

24
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,167
He will protect the people
from demons.

25
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:11,042
When a devotee who
always worships Lord Krishna,

26
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,500
when he can impress sage Shuka,

27
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,583
he can impress anyone in the world.

28
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,583
Bhumidevi, not able to bear

29
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:29,875
the weight of the earth,
went and met Lord Brahma.

30
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,583
Lord Brahma immediately took
Bhumidevi and the other Gods

31
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:37,292
and went to Lord Narayanan.

32
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:42,167
Lord Narayanan told Lord Brahma,
"Reduce the burden of the earth."

33
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,000
"Very soon, I am going to
take an avatar on earth."

34
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,458
He also mentions the location.

35
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,667
He says that he will take
birth in Vasadev's house.

36
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:54,250
Due to an increase in the
atrocities of the demons,

37
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:56,958
due to sins committed by them,

38
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,542
and because they lead everyone
on the wrong path,

39
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:04,375
the Lord says that he will be born
as Krishna.

40
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,958
For the betterment of
the people in this world,

41
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,750
he takes this crucial decision.

42
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,125
The elder son will be called Rama,

43
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,583
that's how Balarama gets his name.

44
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:24,458
Avatar means coming
from one place to the other.

45
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:27,917
God descends
on earth from Vaikuntha.

46
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:30,042
Why did He descend upon earth?

47
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:33,958
To guide common people like us.

48
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,292
Hence, he took an avatar.

49
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,333
Because...
- Meera forgot her card.

50
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,458
He said, "To drive away

51
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:47,417
the injustice from earth, I will
take an avatar on the planet."

52
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:25,417
Meera...

53
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,958
Our respective families know
that we're in love with each other.

54
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:30,750
Yes.

55
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,583
We'll get in trouble if we
are caught meeting stealthily.

56
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,833
You're right. Let's go.
- Hello, sit down.

57
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,458
No.

58
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,125
We have been dating each other
for a long time.

59
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:02,125
My father has given his approval
for our marriage, please wait.

60
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,667
He said we should get married
only if I settle down.

61
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,458
Won't you settle down in life?

62
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:10,125
Come on, Meera.

63
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,417
I will settle down after
graduating from college.

64
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,083
Then clear your supplementary exams.

65
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,958
Lord Krishna has a girlfriend
in the neighbourhood.

66
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:39,000
She doesn't talk to
him for several days.

67
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:43,582
He decides to talk to her.

68
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,542
He comes to the shrine

69
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,208
and waits for her eagerly.

70
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:52,375
But during his absence,
she attends school.

71
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,833
When she peeped,

72
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,708
Lord Krishna also
peeped at the same time.

73
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,999
He then waved at her.

74
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,917
Lord Krishna asks his girlfriend,
"Where have you been?"

75
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,625
I will beat you!

76
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,833
It's been days since I beat you,

77
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,375
that's why you're doing this.

78
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:34,958
If you return home without the dog,

79
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,708
I won't spare you.

80
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,125
Find the dog.

81
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,708
Someone must have taken it away.

82
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,291
You failed to look after a dog,

83
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,917
you don't deserve to have one.

84
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,708
Such a waste of money.

85
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,958
They were after me to buy a dog.

86
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,958
Initially, they were
after it all the time

87
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,667
and then they lost interest.

88
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,917
Why are you here?
You also played with him.

89
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,417
Find the dog.

90
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:17,125
I will trace the dog

91
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,750
using my sixth sense.

92
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,708
If I am right,

93
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,333
that would be great.

94
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:49,750
Mom!

95
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,208
Mom, I found the dog!

96
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,917
Where did you find it?

97
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:13,250
I found it in the temple corridor.

98
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,208
Do you want tea?

99
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,583
Give me some.

100
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,375
When I serve food to dad,
I'll serve you as well.

101
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,250
Mom.

102
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,750
Mom.
- Yes?

103
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,875
My menstrual date was on the 3rd,

104
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,917
it's 7th today,
I still haven't got my periods.

105
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,708
It's been delayed by four days.
- Yes.

106
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,417
That's not a problem,

107
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,292
it happens when your body is weak.

108
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,833
Look at you, you don't eat well.

109
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,583
You go to college
without having breakfast.

110
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,833
I wonder if you even have lunch.

111
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,833
You don't even have dinner properly.

112
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,958
It's been delayed by four days?
- Four days.

113
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,167
Change the channel,
let's see who is batting first.

114
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,583
Wait, dad.

115
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,458
Only for a little while.
Please.

116
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,292
Wait, dad.

117
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,333
It's the central minister,
he was here to meet the seer.

118
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:52,500
Oh.

119
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,208
Me?

120
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,125
Me?

121
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,292
He's calling you.

122
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,458
I visit often, but he has
not called me even once.

123
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:53,917
Yes?

124
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:56,417
Child,

125
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,958
tell him your problem.

126
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:05,583
I have to clear the
supplementary exams at any cost.

127
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:16,875
I'll be able to settle down only if
I clear the supplementary exams.

128
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,542
I am dating a girl.

129
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:23,292
I'll be able to marry her,
only if I settle down.

130
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,125
With the grace of God,

131
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,667
everything will fall into
place for you, hereafter.

132
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:45,583
Eat.

133
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,667
My stomach is full.

134
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,583
Hello.
- Meera.

135
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:22,750
Tell me.

136
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,708
The seer spoke to me.
- I see.

137
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,708
He said everything will
fall into place.

138
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,417
When are you coming back?

139
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,583
Tonight.

140
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,333
Okay. We will meet tomorrow.

141
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:18,500
Did you get your menses?

142
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,125
Not yet.

143
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,625
I am very powerful.

144
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,833
I am the avatar of God.

145
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,375
No one other than me knows about it.

146
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,083
I'm telling you because
you're my best friend.

147
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,417
I found my missing dog
using my powers.

148
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,542
I won't use my power now,
I'll use it for a greater purpose.

149
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,708
I will use it for my benefit.

150
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,792
I won't use it unnecessarily.

151
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:25,542
Don't tell anyone about it.

152
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,583
Okay.

153
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,417
Sethu! Narayanan! Get up!

154
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:35,125
Why are you talking in class?

155
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,583
Sethu, this is the
last warning for you.

156
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,583
If you talk again, I'll throw
you out of the classroom.

157
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:50,583
Sit!

158
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,375
Yes, mom?
- I'm here to take the lunch box.

159
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,458
Why didn't you have lunch?
- I was not hungry.

160
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,833
Are you unwell?

161
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,583
I am just tired.

162
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,583
Did you get your menses?

163
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,583
No, mom.

164
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:25,750
Meera...

165
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,167
Why are you still asleep?

166
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:31,542
Don't you have college today?

167
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,667
I do.

168
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:35,958
Did you get your menses?

169
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:41,625
Don't go to college today.

170
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,125
There shouldn't be
so much of a delay.

171
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,458
Let's meet our family doctor.

172
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,417
Karnan.

173
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,833
Duryodhana.

174
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,042
Dharman.

175
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:13,167
Arjunan.

176
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,625
Bheeman.

177
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,583
Nakulan. Sahadevan.

178
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,500
Who's playing Draupadi?

179
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,083
Draupadi...
- Ma'am...

180
00:22:26,667 --> 00:22:27,500
Krishnan.

181
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:40,833
Thank you.

182
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,292
They are playing soldiers.

183
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,208
You're God, not him.

184
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,250
Let's rehearse.

185
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:12,208
Ma'am..

186
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,417
Ma'am.
- Yes?

187
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,750
I want to pee.

188
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:20,583
Make it fast.

189
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
She's crazy.

190
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,333
Sethu is the real God.

191
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,375
You're right.

192
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:16,333
He will be the right
person to play Krishnan.

193
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,042
He looks like Lord Krishna's avatar.

194
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:27,417
Shall we tell her
you're the real avatar?

195
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,708
I have told you not to tell
anyone about it, didn't I?

196
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:31,208
Yes.

197
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,333
I am the avatar of God.

198
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,250
Promise me you won't
tell anyone about it.

199
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:48,625
I swear by God, I won't
tell anyone about it.

200
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
She's pregnant.

201
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,500
No doctor, it can't be.
- Shut up!

202
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:07,333
Are you crazy?

203
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:10,250
Dad had given his approval
for your marriage.

204
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,500
But, what the hell have you done?

205
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,667
No, mom.
- Shut up!

206
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:14,958
Just shut up!
- Look,

207
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:16,845
such a matter becomes worse only

208
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:18,667
because of parents like you
who panic.

209
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,208
Understand that first.

210
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,625
She's not a school kid.

211
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:28,833
She's in the final year
of college.

212
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,000
I will speak to your husband.

213
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:48,958
Meera is weak.

214
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:53,792
An abortion would stress her
physically and mentally as well.

215
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:58,625
I know people who haven't
been able to have children

216
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,792
after the first abortion.

217
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,542
Mudra.
- Uncle.

218
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:08,958
Come here.

219
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,042
It's a being.

220
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:20,417
Ethically, I'd advice
not to kill it.

221
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,583
And one more thing.
We won't understand it.

222
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:28,583
The memory of the foetus

223
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:31,417
would make her feel guilty forever.

224
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:35,375
You said the boy's family

225
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:38,167
is aware about them
dating each other.

226
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,375
I suggest you get them both married
instead of going for an abortion.

227
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,000
Sister!

228
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,583
Hello.

229
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,667
Who's this?
- I am Meera's father speaking.

230
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,792
Uncle. Tell me.

231
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:25,958
Come home.

232
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,083
I'll be there.

233
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,625
Who was it?
- I will tell you later.

234
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,917
Increase the volume
of the television.

235
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:09,917
Hi.

236
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,167
Hi, uncle.

237
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,333
Gayu, go inside.

238
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:57,000
She's pregnant.

239
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,167
She's pregnant?

240
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Who's pregnant?

241
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:15,875
My daughter is pregnant.

242
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,792
Meera is pregnant.

243
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:35,792
What?

244
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,375
My daughter is pregnant.

245
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:50,083
Meera?

246
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:28,375
Give me your father's number.

247
00:32:30,042 --> 00:32:30,875
Uncle?

248
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,292
Tell me your father's number.

249
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,625
My father's number?

250
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,542
98...

251
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,542
98...

252
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,958
4... 402...

253
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,167
Is it double 4?

254
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:45,958
No, just 4.

255
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,667
8888.

256
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,458
Uncle, Meera..

257
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,667
Okay.

258
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:17,333
Is your father out of his mind?
He says you're pregnant.

259
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:21,083
Meera, he told me you're pregnant
and took my father's number.

260
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,750
Stop him. Otherwise,
there will be a mess.

261
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,917
Hey, why are you crying?

262
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:36,667
Mom and I saw the
doctor this morning.

263
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,792
Is it? Regarding what?

264
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,417
My menses have been
delayed by six days.

265
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:45,208
Does it mean you're pregnant?

266
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:48,292
But the doctor said that
I am pregnant.

267
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:50,583
Is it?

268
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,583
Did he examine you?

269
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:59,250
He's not a good doctor,
don't believe what he said.

270
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,167
Initially, even I
didn't believe him.

271
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,500
I then did a strip test at home,

272
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,083
even that showed positive.

273
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:11,250
What's a strip test?

274
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:13,417
One comes to know with that.

275
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:18,333
How does one come to know with that?

276
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,500
One comes to know with that.

277
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:24,042
Why are you crying
as if you're pregnant?

278
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:26,708
All the tests are positive.

279
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:31,042
How is it possible, Meera? I...

280
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:35,667
Nothing happened between us.
How is it possible?

281
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:38,708
Don't get confused.

282
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:42,250
The doctor and the
test results are wrong.

283
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:43,958
Don't worry.

284
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,542
Let's consult a good doctor
tomorrow itself.

285
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,250
You're good for nothing.

286
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,208
My daughter...

287
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,250
Meera is very weak.

288
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,625
The doctor said that
abortion is a bad idea.

289
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:35,792
He said she would face problems
in the future.

290
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,833
I don't want my daughter to suffer.

291
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:45,667
She's a young girl.

292
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:57,083
I'm sorry about what happened.

293
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:01,875
Tell me, how should
we go about this?

294
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,167
The only option I see is marriage.

295
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:28,625
Okay.

296
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,750
Anyway, we were
about to get them married.

297
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:42,250
We should've done it
after my son's graduation.

298
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:52,458
But in today's day and age,
it's not a problem, let's do it.

299
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:00,417
But let's do it at the earliest,

300
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:02,833
or else, it will bring us shame.

301
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:07,417
Let's tell the people
that the horoscope says,

302
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,833
'If not now, they won't be able to
get married in the next ten years.'

303
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,000
Don't worry.

304
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,083
Let's fix the wedding date
at the earliest.

305
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,250
Thank you very much.

306
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,417
It's okay.

307
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,042
Give her the prescribed medicine.

308
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:07,167
The test is positive.

309
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Don't try to abort
the baby elsewhere.

310
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:14,917
She's very weak, already.

311
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,458
If something goes wrong,
she'll suffer forever.

312
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:19,667
Careful.

313
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,958
Go home and inform
your parents about it.

314
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,708
Don't stress her.

315
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,958
It's the matter of her life.

316
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:37,667
You're smart when it comes to
general things.

317
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:42,458
You know where to meet, what to do

318
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,917
and if something like this
happens, whom to consult.

319
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:53,792
But you don't realize the
consequences of such things.

320
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:09,708
You may go.

321
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,708
Mister.
- Sir.

322
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,333
Is this medicine for me?

323
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:23,708
No, sir.

324
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,375
Sir, fees.

325
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,125
The fees.

326
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:40,167
Pay outside.

327
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:41,750
Okay, sir.

328
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:55,792
Yes, sir.
- The fees.

329
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:57,125
Rs. 300.

330
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:06,917
Buy the medicine over there.

331
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:39,125
He's with a patient, I will
call you once he's done.

332
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:40,708
Please wait.
- Okay.

333
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,458
Meera.

334
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,167
Meera, don't cry.

335
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:02,417
Why are you crying?

336
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,583
Even this doctor
told the same thing.

337
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:13,667
Meera, give me one last chance,

338
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:16,167
let's consult the best
gynaecologist in Madras.

339
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:18,458
Let's tell the doctor everything.

340
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:03,875
Where is your phone?

341
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:05,708
Where have you been?

342
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:10,333
We had gone to see the sample
of the wedding invitation card.

343
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:12,792
Are you crazy?
He has no common sense.

344
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:13,833
What's the matter with you?

345
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:16,833
You must not travel on the bike
during pregnancy.

346
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:22,667
Give her this folic acid tablet.

347
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,208
You're pregnant.

348
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,542
Your foetus is four weeks old.

349
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:35,625
You will have a baby
in the next 37 weeks.

350
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:52,750
Doctor, is she pregnant?

351
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:54,042
Why do you ask?

352
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,500
Actually,

353
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:58,417
we consulted two doctors, already.

354
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,375
They also said that
she's pregnant.

355
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:02,833
All the doctors would
say the same thing.

356
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:04,750
Doctor,

357
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:07,125
what I mean to say is,

358
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:09,500
nothing...

359
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:13,750
nothing happened...

360
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:15,542
Nothing happened
between the two of us, doctor.

361
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,583
What?

362
00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:20,708
There has never been
intercourse between the two of us.

363
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,250
Then how did you become pregnant?

364
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:25,708
I don't know,

365
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:27,417
but nothing happened
between the two of us.

366
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,958
Then how did you get pregnant?

367
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:41,792
You know. Maybe
after the party in a pub...

368
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:44,583
No doctor, we have
never been to such a place.

369
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:48,000
Maybe the two of you
got drunk and...

370
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:50,625
No doctor, we don't drink.

371
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,333
Do you stay together?

372
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,042
No doctor, we live in
our respective houses.

373
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:56,500
Then how can this happen?

374
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,667
Mister.
- Doctor.

375
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:12,125
Could you wait for a few minutes?

376
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:14,708
Okay, doctor.

377
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,875
Are you kidding me?

378
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:30,208
How could it be possible
without your knowledge?

379
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:32,833
I don't understand, doctor.

380
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:34,792
What's your name?
Come again.

381
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,000
Meera.

382
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:38,792
Meera, did you sleep
with another man?

383
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,667
Don't cry, Meera. Stop crying.

384
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:53,625
Meera, it's a very serious issue.

385
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:55,292
Try to remember.

386
00:46:55,417 --> 00:46:58,750
If you had a visitor home
and without your knowledge...

387
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:00,708
How is it possible, doctor?

388
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:03,875
What are you trying to tell me?
Are you still a virgin?

389
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:10,375
Stop crying, Meera. Stop crying.

390
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:27,792
Yes, doctor.

391
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,625
Send the boy inside.
- Okay, doctor.

392
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,958
The two of you

393
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,098
come to this
multi-speciality hospital

394
00:47:56,122 --> 00:47:58,500
sharp at 11:30 tomorrow.

395
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:01,042
Don't delay. See me there.

396
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,208
Sir, come.

397
00:50:47,708 --> 00:50:48,458
Go inside.

398
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:32,583
Are you her boyfriend?

399
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:36,958
Fantastic!

400
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:40,333
All right, you may go.

401
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:49,583
We will run through the
reports of the tests conducted.

402
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:53,458
We will send for you
after a couple of days.

403
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:45,042
It's not for you, drink it.

404
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:03,167
Why do you look stressed
all the time?

405
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:05,667
Me? I am fine.

406
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:10,292
I see. Let's book a wedding hall.

407
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,375
The wedding hall? Okay.

408
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:14,499
Number of guests for
the wedding reception?

409
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,333
Well, we need to consult
the groom's family.

410
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,792
Around 300-400 people.

411
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,875
300-400 people... Yes.

412
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,458
Welcome drink, sweets,

413
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:28,292
steamed cake, fritters,
porridge, fried pancake,

414
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:31,417
different types of
puddings, ice cream.

415
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,750
It will be a grand feast.

416
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:35,792
We also cater North Indian food.

417
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:39,667
Food will be the highlight
in your daughter's wedding.

418
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:11,542
Eat.

419
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:33,458
Our family doctor has prescribed
medicines because I am pregnant.

420
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,667
They will call us tomorrow,
won't they?

421
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,958
Yes, they will.

422
00:54:45,417 --> 00:54:46,333
Are you crazy?

423
00:54:46,458 --> 00:54:47,917
You're not supposed
to carry any weight.

424
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,208
When will they call us?

425
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,792
I can't take it any more.

426
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:08,625
We can expect a call from
them by evening, have patience.

427
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,583
Hello.

428
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:35,208
I am calling from
Chettinadu hospital.

429
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:37,125
Come to the hospital in the evening.
- Okay.

430
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,917
You must be here by four.
- Okay.

431
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,375
Bring your parents along.

432
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:42,375
Oh.

433
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:44,750
Okay, I will.

434
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:45,583
Okay.

435
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:46,458
Okay.

436
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:54,458
Hello, Meera.

437
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:56,583
I just got a call from the hospital.

438
00:55:58,792 --> 00:55:59,917
What did they say?

439
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:01,792
They have asked you to
bring your parents along.

440
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,708
What will I tell my parents?

441
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:07,125
Meera, tell them the truth.
It's the only option.

442
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:08,958
It's mandatory.

443
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:11,542
Okay.

444
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,500
Dad?

445
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:21,417
Mom...

446
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:45,167
What's your name?

447
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:47,125
Rangarajan.

448
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,958
I am Ramachandran.

449
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,458
Rangarajan, where do you work?

450
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,625
At the agriculture department.

451
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,500
Then it's easy.

452
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:59,292
I'm sure you know
about asexual reproduction.

453
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:01,292
Yes, I do.

454
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:04,583
Your daughter is just like

455
00:58:04,792 --> 00:58:07,167
the species you just saw.

456
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:15,458
These species conceive on their own.

457
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,458
Meaning, without
the support of a male,

458
00:58:21,792 --> 00:58:27,417
the female has conceived
on her own.

459
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:30,292
It's just fantastic.

460
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:35,500
It happens only
with certain species.

461
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:38,167
A year ago,

462
00:58:38,542 --> 00:58:44,250
in a zoo in America,
a shark conceived on its own.

463
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:50,167
Medically, we call
it Parthenogenesis.

464
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:54,083
Otherwise, we call
it as a virgin birth.

465
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:58,292
Or, baby without a father.

466
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:05,458
Meaning, a female conceives

467
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:10,417
on her own
without the help of a male.

468
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,625
A research is being conducted if

469
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:20,667
the same thing can happen
to humans as well.

470
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:25,625
In the 1950s, a woman in
England, conceived on her own

471
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:28,250
and birthed a girl baby,

472
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:29,750
that's what they said.

473
00:59:30,042 --> 00:59:32,708
But it was not proved medically.

474
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:34,417
It has happened now.

475
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:39,125
In the human race, your daughter

476
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:42,542
is the first woman to
conceive on her own.

477
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:58,167
Meaning, a baby without a father.

478
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:01,833
Doctor, why did it happen
only to my daughter?

479
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,833
It's not a disease.

480
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:08,125
Actually, your daughter
is very special.

481
01:00:08,792 --> 01:00:10,750
Whether you like it or not,

482
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:13,667
the news will go to
the medical council,

483
01:00:14,292 --> 01:00:16,000
the entire world
will know of it.

484
01:00:18,417 --> 01:00:20,417
Your daughter is still a virgin.

485
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:22,958
She's still a virgin.

486
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,208
Sorry.

487
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:47,917
Thanks.

488
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:00,792
Hello.

489
01:01:01,042 --> 01:01:02,958
Sara, where are you?

490
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:04,750
I have come out with mom. Tell me.

491
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:06,292
I see.

492
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:08,458
Why?

493
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:10,667
Can you come home?

494
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:11,792
Is it?

495
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:15,083
I'll drop mom home.
Shall I come in an hour?

496
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:17,625
Okay.

497
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:41,000
'The minister met the seer today
and returned to Delhi.'

498
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:44,167
'A woman in Chennai
has conceived on her own.'

499
01:03:44,292 --> 01:03:49,167
'A woman named Meera in Chennai
has conceived on her own.'

500
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:52,458
'The doctors say it
is Parthenogenesis.'

501
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,917
'Similar kind of incident
took place abroad.'

502
01:03:56,042 --> 01:03:58,792
'A female has
conceived on her own.'

503
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:00,958
'The unborn is called,'

504
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,375
'baby without a father.'

505
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:13,167
'A woman in Chennai
has conceived on her own.'

506
01:04:13,292 --> 01:04:16,958
'The medical council
said it is Parthenogenesis.'

507
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:18,708
"Radio City."

508
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:22,417
You are listening to
Radio City, 91.1 FM.

509
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:26,167
'The entire city is talking
about this since morning.'

510
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:29,375
'If such things can
happen on its own,'

511
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:31,792
'what are men for?'

512
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,667
'Why should anyone talk about it?'

513
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:59,000
I am Ganesh, welcome
to the live debate.

514
01:04:59,167 --> 01:05:01,875
An incident has shocked
the entire nation.

515
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:05,042
A young woman named Meera
from Chennai

516
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,583
will be birthing a
baby without a father.

517
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:11,250
To talk about it, we have
with us, Venkatachalam and

518
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:14,125
reporter Aarti, Meenakshi Verma,

519
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:16,333
and social activist Karthik.

520
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:18,250
We will discuss this.
Aarti, go.

521
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,000
This is such a blessing.

522
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,667
If this goes on continuously,

523
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,875
we won't have to
depend on men at all.

524
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,250
Dependency will decrease.

525
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:28,500
I think as time goes by,
the male race will decrease.

526
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:29,417
You are right.

527
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:30,958
Suppose, by God's grace,

528
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:34,000
if you experience the same thing,

529
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,625
what if you give
birth to a baby boy?

530
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,833
No, this is a rare phenomenon.

531
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,667
A very rare phenomenon.

532
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:44,167
It's highly doubtful that such
a thing will happen again.

533
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:45,417
I don't think so.

534
01:05:45,667 --> 01:05:46,917
This is human evolution.

535
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:49,875
Like humans evolved from monkeys.
This is an evolution.

536
01:05:50,042 --> 01:05:51,125
Everything happens for good.

537
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,958
'This is a very big issue.'

538
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,750
'For God's sake, don't get confused
by relating it to science.'

539
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:06,167
'Like doctors say, this is
not the first child.'

540
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:08,750
'This has happened earlier.'

541
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:12,042
'5000 years ago,
in the Mahabharata,'

542
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:15,417
'how did Kunti give birth
to Karna and Pandavas?'

543
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:19,750
'2000 years ago, how did
Mary give birth to Jesus?'

544
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:22,958
'Such children are not common.'

545
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:24,958
'They are God's children.'

546
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:28,333
Then, Sethu.

547
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:33,292
'A child who is born without
with a father, is an avatar.'

548
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:38,458
'Krita, Treta, and Dvapara era...'

549
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:43,042
'In every era
an avatar will be born.'

550
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:47,375
'Similarly, in this bad era, an
avatar will be born to guide us.'

551
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:49,708
'That avatar'

552
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:53,042
'has come into this
girl's womb on its own.'

553
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:57,542
'The child that will be born
is the avatar of God.'

554
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:05,833
Should there be only
one God in this world?

555
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,917
There is Muruga, Vinayaka, Ayappa,

556
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:15,542
Jesus,
like Him, even you're a God,

557
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:16,917
even that is a God.

558
01:07:17,042 --> 01:07:19,417
There may be many such Gods.

559
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:24,417
What are you thinking?

560
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,833
There are many Gods,

561
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:29,583
but I don't know if they exist.

562
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:31,375
That's what I was thinking.

563
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,750
The jeweller had called.

564
01:07:44,167 --> 01:07:45,208
He says the nuptial chain is ready.

565
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,667
Let's pick it up from there
on an auspicious day.

566
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,417
When should we start
giving away invitations?

567
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:51,875
I have to apply for leave
in the office.

568
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,792
What will you say when you
distribute the invitations?

569
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:55,833
Everyone in the city knows about it.

570
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,917
They are flashing it
on the TV and radio

571
01:07:58,042 --> 01:08:00,833
that the child is
born without a father.

572
01:08:01,917 --> 01:08:03,333
Do you think the
wedding is necessary?

573
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:06,167
Mom, how is that issue
connected to the wedding?

574
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:08,333
Stay quiet.
We can't do as you please.

575
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:14,500
Your mom is right.

576
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:17,583
We can't go ahead without knowing
what is going on in Meera's house.

577
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:37,333
We wanted to get them married
soon, but that didn't happen.

578
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:40,250
Everyone has learnt about it.

579
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:42,750
Then why should we
hurry for the wedding?

580
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,667
Let them finish college
and then get married.

581
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:48,208
So, we came to talk to you.

582
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:49,458
Sir...

583
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,333
We wanted to know your opinion.

584
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:54,125
Do you have any other idea?

585
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:56,708
We haven't informed anyone yet

586
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:58,375
or given away the invitations.

587
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,250
We have just paid the advance money.

588
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:02,667
That's not an issue.

589
01:09:02,792 --> 01:09:07,208
Moreover, we don't want
to trouble Meera at this time.

590
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:23,250
Sir, he is still young.
He doesn't know anything.

591
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:25,125
He blabbers nonsense.

592
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:27,292
What does he say?

593
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:30,875
Uncle, no matter who says what,

594
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:34,292
it's our child, we have to
support each other during this time.

595
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:40,708
Moreover, we couldn't look after it.

596
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:42,083
We have to be together.

597
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,167
I don't want to be a father
after the child is born,

598
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,500
I need to be a father to it
before it is born.

599
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,333
I don't have any confusion.

600
01:09:57,917 --> 01:09:59,208
He is my son-in-law.

601
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:04,500
I have decided to solemnize the
wedding on the day we had fixed it.

602
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:08,375
It's up to us.

603
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,333
The wedding will take place
according to the wish of the family.

604
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:12,917
We were wrong that day.

605
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:16,708
If he had said anything wrong,
things would have gone haywire.

606
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:21,792
Sir, we learnt a lot
from him.

607
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:27,083
He is the reason why
we're living peacefully today.

608
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:29,625
Sir, he has always
been supportive of us.

609
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:33,250
Let's support them.

610
01:10:35,042 --> 01:10:38,083
Why should we get
confused and tensed?

611
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:40,958
Sir, let's go ahead with
what we had decided.

612
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:50,417
You're right, sir.

613
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,375
Let's not change anything.

614
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,625
Let's go ahead with the
wedding as we had decided.

615
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:42,125
Finally, you became pregnant.

616
01:11:53,667 --> 01:11:54,917
Is it sir or ma'am?

617
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,875
Get admitted one week
before the delivery date.

618
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,875
We live close by, do we
have to get her admitted?

619
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:19,875
Okay. Come here immediately if
she experiences any discomfort.

620
01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:22,583
Not just you, this is
the first time for us too.

621
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:02,167
Sara...

622
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,958
Sara, it hurts!

623
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:16,583
Is it hurting too much?
- Yes.

624
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:31,500
Hello, I am Saravanan speaking.

625
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:33,292
Meera's husband speaking.

626
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:34,750
Meera is suffering from labour pain.

627
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:39,667
Please come soon.

628
01:16:43,917 --> 01:16:45,250
I'll inform them.

629
01:17:01,542 --> 01:17:03,417
What is it? - Meera is
suffering from labour pain.

630
01:17:03,542 --> 01:17:04,417
Lakshmi!

631
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:15,917
Call the doctor.

632
01:17:16,042 --> 01:17:18,542
Uncle, I called. They are sending
an ambulance. - Is it?

633
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:20,417
Don't worry.

634
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:04,042
Take care of the house,
we're going to the hospital. - Okay.

635
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,208
Take care.

636
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:18,333
Get in.

637
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:33,250
She gave birth to a baby girl.

638
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,292
Move aside.

639
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:47,625
Move back.

640
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:51,500
Move back.

641
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:55,583
Move aside.

642
01:21:55,667 --> 01:21:57,208
Move!

643
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,958
'Meera, who had become
pregnant mysteriously,'

644
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:04,875
'gave birth to a baby girl
today.'

645
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:08,875
'The family informed that
the child and mother are fine.'

646
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:12,375
'People believe that this
child is an avatar of this era.'

647
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:18,292
'People expressed their happiness
by offering prayers and celebrated.'

648
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:20,125
'The Prime Minister,
the chief minister'

649
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:23,792
'and the other ministers have
conveyed their best wishes.'

650
01:23:23,875 --> 01:23:27,083
'The time the child was born
is not ordinary.'

651
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,208
'All the planets...'

652
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:34,500
'Seemed like the world was praying'

653
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:37,708
'for this special baby to be born.'

654
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,500
'As per the planetary positions,
this baby is more favourable'

655
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:49,625
'than the similar kind
of children born earlier.'

656
01:23:49,708 --> 01:23:52,958
'Special and surprising news!'

657
01:23:53,083 --> 01:23:57,375
'Nostradamus had written
about this in his book.'

658
01:23:57,625 --> 01:24:00,000
'He had predicted that'

659
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:03,292
'a virgin mother will give
birth to a child'

660
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:05,667
'and that child will
be born in a country'

661
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:07,833
'which is surrounded by
three parts of the ocean.'

662
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:11,458
'He already predicted that
the child would rule this world.'

663
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,667
He could've been born
anywhere in the world.

664
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,917
Why did he take birth
in your house?

665
01:24:29,792 --> 01:24:31,583
He could've been born as a male God,

666
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:33,875
why did he take birth
as a female God?

667
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:38,667
Like Sita for Rama.

668
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:44,042
Like Parvathi for Shiva.

669
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:49,292
For Sethu...

670
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:10,875
She's cute.
Her smile is so beautiful.

671
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:16,708
Sethu, why are you standing there?
Come close and look at her.

672
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,583
Mom...

673
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,042
Say, 'Mom'.

674
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:54,750
Say, 'Dad'.

675
01:27:19,292 --> 01:27:21,417
Darshini.
- Dad.

676
01:28:20,833 --> 01:28:22,250
Get your child admitted
to our school.

677
01:28:22,292 --> 01:28:24,542
We have a very advanced syllabus.
- Excellent facilities.

678
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:25,667
You need not pay the fees.

679
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:27,583
You just get your child
admitted in our school.

680
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:54,917
"Radio City!"

681
01:28:55,292 --> 01:28:58,625
You have heard
about Radio City 91.1.

682
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,333
Many celebrities have
come on our show.

683
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,792
I can't address her as a celebrity
as it will be an insult to God.

684
01:29:02,833 --> 01:29:05,541
God's child is on our show.

685
01:29:05,542 --> 01:29:07,750
We're going to talk to you
on our show for the first time.

686
01:29:07,917 --> 01:29:09,250
Greetings. What is your name?

687
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:10,458
My name is Darshini.

688
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:14,042
Mom's name is Meera, and
dad's name is Saravanan.

689
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:15,958
Don't get confused.

690
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:18,583
She is addressing her
mother's husband as her dad.

691
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:19,458
Excuse me.

692
01:29:19,792 --> 01:29:20,458
Ma'am?

693
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:21,917
Don't say that.

694
01:29:22,292 --> 01:29:25,917
No one can become a father
just by begetting a child.

695
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,250
Saravanan is Darshini's father.

696
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:31,875
I said it in a flow, I'm sorry.

697
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,583
No problem.

698
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:34,926
The child considers
me as her father.

699
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,167
I don't care about what others say.

700
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:38,250
I'll let the God child
touch it first.

701
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:02,542
Sara.
- Yes.

702
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:05,458
Everyone is calling her God's child,

703
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:07,333
do you feel the same?

704
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:09,542
No.

705
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:10,958
Sarvannan.

706
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:12,042
Dad?

707
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,375
There was a call from the monastery.

708
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:16,417
Why, dad?

709
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:19,333
I don't know. He asked to get the
child's horoscope when you meet him.

710
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:20,917
Horoscope?
- Yes.

711
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:24,292
He has called us, let's meet him.

712
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Okay, dad.

713
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:54,875
Greetings, please come.

714
01:32:00,958 --> 01:32:02,208
You go, I'll join you.

715
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,333
I'll be back.

716
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:40,917
They are here.

717
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,375
Get them inside.

718
01:32:48,917 --> 01:32:49,792
Please come.

719
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:27,458
This is a divine horoscope.

720
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:46,875
The Goddess had come in my dreams
early in the morning.

721
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:50,833
So, I asked you to meet me.

722
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:57,500
She has reached where she had to.

723
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:03,333
May her dwell here.

724
01:34:03,792 --> 01:34:05,792
People will take care of her.

725
01:34:13,833 --> 01:34:17,750
It is time for the prayers.
Everyone will be waiting for us.

726
01:34:18,167 --> 01:34:20,750
Get the Goddess to the temple.

727
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:59,667
What did the sage say?
I didn't understand.

728
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:02,167
How can I leave my child here?

729
01:35:02,292 --> 01:35:04,375
Why are you saying such things?

730
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:06,458
This child was born for
the betterment of this world.

731
01:35:06,583 --> 01:35:08,125
She should stay where she has to.

732
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:12,292
No, I won't give my child to anyone.

733
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:15,167
That child was not born
as per your decision.

734
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:17,917
Did you know you would give
birth to such a divine child?

735
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:19,750
How do you take it to be your child?

736
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:23,208
If God wishes, He can
choose anyone for this task.

737
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:25,958
He has chosen you. That's it.

738
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:29,375
Don't address her as God's child.
She is a three-year-old girl.

739
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,208
How can we leave her here?
- Stay quiet.

740
01:35:32,375 --> 01:35:35,250
How are you related to her?
I'm speaking to the mother.

741
01:35:36,625 --> 01:35:39,958
I can't give her away.
She can't live without us.

742
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:43,583
We take care of children
as if they were Gods.

743
01:35:43,958 --> 01:35:47,292
If God is born as a child,
wouldn't we take care of it?

744
01:35:48,208 --> 01:35:50,125
Listen, tell them to leave her here.

745
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:52,458
It is time for the
prayers, let's go.

746
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,375
Let's go, mom.

747
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:58,542
We won't leave her here.

748
01:36:50,542 --> 01:36:52,042
The priest is waiting.

749
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,792
Stop. Where are you going?

750
01:39:01,833 --> 01:39:02,750
My child.

751
01:39:02,792 --> 01:39:04,583
She left long ago.
You can leave now.

752
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:13,417
Where is the child?

753
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,750
Which child?

754
01:39:14,833 --> 01:39:16,667
My child. You took
her inside a while ago.

755
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:18,167
You worshipped her.

756
01:39:18,333 --> 01:39:19,208
She?

757
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:21,958
She left with the priest long ago.
Wait.

758
01:39:22,667 --> 01:39:23,875
You can't go there.

759
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:25,042
Come.

760
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:34,833
Stay here, I'll tell you.

761
01:39:56,167 --> 01:39:57,417
He is inside.

762
01:39:57,667 --> 01:39:59,042
You can't trouble him.

763
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:01,083
The worship hours are over.

764
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:04,042
You can't stay here. Please leave.

765
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:06,000
How can we leave without our child?

766
01:40:11,625 --> 01:40:12,667
Please leave.

767
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:17,167
Don't get angry.

768
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,875
It is futile to do so.

769
01:40:20,458 --> 01:40:21,333
What about Darshini?

770
01:40:25,333 --> 01:40:26,292
I will go.

771
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:31,333
Tell me.

772
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:32,708
I want my child.

773
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:34,292
She is inside.

774
01:40:35,625 --> 01:40:36,583
I want to see her.

775
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:39,833
Outsiders are not allowed inside
after dusk.

776
01:40:39,958 --> 01:40:41,250
Even the Goddess won't come out.

777
01:40:43,292 --> 01:40:44,583
At least allow the mother...

778
01:40:44,833 --> 01:40:47,833
Oh, my God! That's impossible.

779
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:50,000
She shouldn't meet anyone.

780
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:53,458
So, Goddess shouldn't
meet her mother at all.

781
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:08,750
Until we are here, we won't
be able to do anything.

782
01:41:09,333 --> 01:41:11,167
We have to deal with it
another way.

783
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:12,958
Let's go to Chennai.

784
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:15,083
We will have to deal with it
legally.

785
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:18,875
Sara, she would look for me.

786
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:21,667
Meera, we will surely get Darshini.

787
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:23,958
It won't be possible
until we are here.

788
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:29,917
Mom!

789
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:48,379
How could they
take the child without

790
01:42:48,403 --> 01:42:49,625
the permission of the parents?

791
01:42:51,583 --> 01:42:53,958
You don't wish to give
the child to them, right?

792
01:42:55,542 --> 01:42:57,375
Then it is confirmed that the
child should be with the parents.

793
01:42:57,917 --> 01:42:59,167
Don't worry.

794
01:42:59,292 --> 01:43:01,056
They took the child without
the parents' permission

795
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,708
so, our case is strong.

796
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:07,333
They are influential people,
so, the pressure will be more.

797
01:43:07,625 --> 01:43:08,458
We'll see.

798
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:11,458
I'll try and get the hearing date
as soon as possible.

799
01:43:11,958 --> 01:43:13,000
We can get back the child.

800
01:43:14,875 --> 01:43:15,542
Meera,

801
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:18,583
I have taken an
appointment with the minister.

802
01:43:19,167 --> 01:43:20,708
I will meet him.

803
01:43:22,708 --> 01:43:25,583
Shall we meet Dr. Ramachandran?

804
01:43:26,125 --> 01:43:29,167
He knows everything
about Darshini and us.

805
01:43:29,583 --> 01:43:31,667
He will surely help us.

806
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:35,375
I read it in the newspaper.

807
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:37,917
I thought I'd meet you.

808
01:43:38,125 --> 01:43:40,833
Doctor, you have to tell them that

809
01:43:40,958 --> 01:43:44,167
Darshini is not God's child.
Get her back to me.

810
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,000
When it happens to other species,

811
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:47,667
it's easy to deal with it.

812
01:43:47,875 --> 01:43:49,167
There won't be any problem.

813
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:52,625
Belief in God and superstition
are two different things.

814
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:57,292
The problem began when it
was considered as superstition.

815
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:04,000
I don't know how much
my words will matter,

816
01:44:06,625 --> 01:44:11,083
but I will do my best to help you.

817
01:44:13,375 --> 01:44:15,083
Doctor, what is her mistake?

818
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:26,250
Mom...

819
01:44:29,583 --> 01:44:30,833
Mom...

820
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:35,083
Come, sit here. Eat this.

821
01:44:35,125 --> 01:44:36,875
Look here.

822
01:44:37,542 --> 01:44:40,708
Sit here. Eat this.

823
01:45:42,417 --> 01:45:43,500
She is suffering from fever.

824
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:45,458
I will prescribe some medicines.

825
01:45:47,917 --> 01:45:49,125
Somebody stay with her.

826
01:46:09,333 --> 01:46:11,625
Sara, I don't know how she is.

827
01:46:12,583 --> 01:46:13,625
I am scared.

828
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:17,542
Will we get Darshini?

829
01:46:18,042 --> 01:46:19,250
Sure, Meera.

830
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:22,750
People say she is God's child,

831
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:25,667
I am scared they will make her one.

832
01:46:26,125 --> 01:46:28,917
Meera, don't worry.
Nothing as such will happen.

833
01:46:29,667 --> 01:46:32,625
She is our child.
We will surely get her home.

834
01:46:43,792 --> 01:46:44,958
Bring God's child here.

835
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:38,167
God's child is refusing to come.

836
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:47,292
God's child isn't in the mood
to talk to anyone.

837
01:47:47,417 --> 01:47:49,042
I will call you some other day.

838
01:47:49,208 --> 01:47:53,792
It would've been nice had we
taken blessings from God's child.

839
01:47:54,375 --> 01:47:57,667
Some other day, please.
I'll call you.

840
01:47:59,333 --> 01:48:00,167
Okay, priest.

841
01:48:00,292 --> 01:48:01,792
We shall leave now.
- Good day. - Okay.

842
01:48:09,125 --> 01:48:11,458
God's child is going here and there.

843
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,958
It is difficult to find her.

844
01:48:16,292 --> 01:48:18,333
Shall we get her here
after she's a little older?

845
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:19,458
Yes, priest.

846
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:23,458
Sir, it is not just you
who has filed a case...

847
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:25,000
Sir?

848
01:48:25,458 --> 01:48:27,500
Pontiffs of many temples
have filed a case

849
01:48:27,625 --> 01:48:28,958
stating that the child
belongs to them.

850
01:48:29,292 --> 01:48:30,667
One of them has asked me
to take up this case.

851
01:48:30,958 --> 01:48:32,542
There are so many lawyers.

852
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,250
How many cases would've
been filed! Think about it.

853
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:40,833
I don't think this case
will end up quickly.

854
01:49:14,042 --> 01:49:15,000
Priest,

855
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:18,625
the God's child is missing.

856
01:49:21,875 --> 01:49:23,542
Go, find her.

857
01:52:38,792 --> 01:52:40,125
She is not in her senses.

858
01:52:41,917 --> 01:52:44,708
There won't be any problem if she
regains her senses within six hours.

859
01:52:44,917 --> 01:52:47,750
She has hurt her head.
We have to perform scanning.

860
01:52:48,458 --> 01:52:51,250
First-aid has been administered.
She has lost a lot of blood.

861
01:52:51,708 --> 01:52:54,167
We have performed a test
to find out her blood group.

862
01:52:54,583 --> 01:52:56,250
Only after knowing her blood group,

863
01:52:56,375 --> 01:52:58,250
we have to inform the
donors and the blood banks.

864
01:53:04,667 --> 01:53:06,583
Doctor, please don't
let anyone know about it.

865
01:53:10,625 --> 01:53:13,083
Doctor, here is the blood report.
Her blood group is A1B negative.

866
01:53:15,208 --> 01:53:16,125
It is a rare group.

867
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:18,083
Inform the donors and the
blood banks immediately.

868
01:53:18,292 --> 01:53:19,958
We need A1B blood.

869
01:53:20,125 --> 01:53:22,375
No one should know about it.
- Okay, doctor.

870
01:54:26,917 --> 01:54:28,125
Where is she?

871
01:54:29,792 --> 01:54:30,583
There.

872
01:54:31,667 --> 01:54:32,542
Who are you?

873
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Why are you barging inside?

874
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:35,542
Doctor, they are her parents.

875
01:55:11,458 --> 01:55:12,750
I saw the scan report.

876
01:55:12,833 --> 01:55:15,917
She's hit her head severely, so
there's a blood clot in her brain.

877
01:55:16,792 --> 01:55:19,167
She's lost lots of blood.
We have arranged for some,

878
01:55:19,542 --> 01:55:22,458
but we would need more blood
for the operation.

879
01:55:22,667 --> 01:55:25,792
Her blood group is rare,
so, it is difficult to get it.

880
01:55:26,667 --> 01:55:28,833
We have informed the
donors and the blood banks.

881
01:55:29,208 --> 01:55:30,458
We will get it.
- Doctor...

882
01:55:30,958 --> 01:55:32,875
Darshini and I share
the same blood group.

883
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:36,958
Sir, we'll keep you as a back-up.
We'll need it later.

884
01:55:37,292 --> 01:55:38,708
Then we can ask you to donate.

885
01:55:39,042 --> 01:55:40,958
Now, we'll arrange it from
elsewhere for the operation.

886
01:55:41,625 --> 01:55:43,750
'The child which
was born by a miracle,'

887
01:55:43,792 --> 01:55:47,208
'pontiffs of several temples are
claiming the child to be theirs,'

888
01:55:47,333 --> 01:55:50,375
'the hearing of the case is in
Chennai High Court tomorrow.'

889
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,542
'The parents say that their child'

890
01:55:52,667 --> 01:55:55,250
'has been taken away from them
forcibly'

891
01:55:55,417 --> 01:56:00,333
'and the seers say that she
is the avatar of Goddess.'

892
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:03,625
'The case will be heard
in the court tomorrow.'

893
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:27,167
Stay here.

894
01:56:41,833 --> 01:56:42,958
Sign here.

895
01:58:17,875 --> 01:58:23,167
God's child is battling for her life

896
01:58:23,208 --> 01:58:25,750
and the hearing of
her case is today.

897
01:58:26,625 --> 01:58:28,958
God's child hasn't
regained her senses yet.

898
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,542
The parents of the
child are shattered.

899
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:36,917
It is surprising that

900
01:58:37,042 --> 01:58:39,333
the people who claimed
the child to be theirs,

901
01:58:39,458 --> 01:58:41,583
haven't come to the court today.

902
01:58:45,542 --> 01:58:46,875
This child is God's child.

903
01:58:47,375 --> 01:58:50,167
Everyone says the
child belongs to them.

904
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:53,958
I would like to take a few names.

905
01:58:54,458 --> 01:59:01,333
Murugan, Dhanalakshmi, Peter,
Mohammed Ali, and many other names.

906
01:59:01,583 --> 01:59:02,875
The above-mentioned names,

907
01:59:03,042 --> 01:59:06,167
these people donated their blood
to the child when she was in need.

908
01:59:07,125 --> 01:59:09,875
They didn't know who they
were donating their blood to.

909
01:59:11,792 --> 01:59:13,250
If you think about it,

910
01:59:13,625 --> 01:59:15,250
the names that I just
called out, Murugan,

911
01:59:15,542 --> 01:59:17,708
Peter, and Mohammed.

912
01:59:18,250 --> 01:59:21,875
Now, people of three castes
have donated their blood to her.

913
01:59:22,417 --> 01:59:24,083
Who does the child belong to?

914
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:30,333
If you ask me, the one who comes
forward to help someone in need,

915
01:59:30,458 --> 01:59:31,708
he is God.

916
01:59:36,708 --> 01:59:38,167
The child is God's child.

917
01:59:38,458 --> 01:59:41,667
Today, she is battling for life.

918
01:59:43,250 --> 01:59:46,083
If something happens to her,

919
01:59:46,875 --> 01:59:48,250
what will you do?

920
01:59:49,875 --> 01:59:52,792
We have become so selfish that

921
01:59:52,833 --> 01:59:54,708
we're ready to sacrifice a child.

922
01:59:56,417 --> 01:59:58,917
Forget considering the child as God,

923
01:59:59,083 --> 02:00:01,792
let's try and save that child.

924
02:00:03,167 --> 02:00:04,917
The one who took away the child

925
02:00:05,208 --> 02:00:07,375
without the parents' permission,

926
02:00:07,625 --> 02:00:10,000
this court condemns them.

927
02:00:10,458 --> 02:00:13,333
Moreover, the court orders

928
02:00:13,667 --> 02:00:15,583
an enquiry against them.

929
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:19,125
I don't know if that child is God,

930
02:00:19,708 --> 02:00:21,125
she might be,

931
02:00:21,583 --> 02:00:25,792
but let her turn 18 years old
and decide what she wants to be.

932
02:00:26,333 --> 02:00:28,000
That is good for the child.

933
02:00:29,167 --> 02:00:30,625
I pray to God

934
02:00:30,917 --> 02:00:32,250
that the child should survive.

935
02:00:32,667 --> 02:00:35,542
The child should
stay with her parents.

936
02:00:36,042 --> 02:00:37,917
This is the verdict of the court.

937
02:01:21,958 --> 02:01:23,125
Mom...

938
02:01:36,083 --> 02:01:37,500
Dad...

939
02:01:58,292 --> 02:02:03,083
'When the story began, there was
someone who said he was an avatar.'

940
02:02:03,458 --> 02:02:04,500
'Where is he now?'

941
02:02:13,083 --> 02:02:13,958
Sethu,

942
02:02:16,042 --> 02:02:17,333
did you hear the news?

943
02:02:19,042 --> 02:02:20,167
A child is born

944
02:02:20,417 --> 02:02:23,542
with '666' on the forehead
in Kazakhstan.

945
02:02:25,958 --> 02:02:28,583
Satan is born, get to work.

946
02:02:38,125 --> 02:02:40,250
Did you finish your homework?
- Yes.

947
02:02:40,958 --> 02:02:42,625
You finished it, didn't you?
Go away.

948
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:51,083
'Being children, they understood,'

949
02:02:51,375 --> 02:02:52,208
'but...'
