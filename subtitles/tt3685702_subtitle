00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,426
'LONDON BRIDGE'

2
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,774
'Truly speaking I was not
like this till yesterday'

3
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:23,111
'Even for making a small decision
today I think quite a lot'

4
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:28,919
'Perhaps today may become
the most important day in my life'

5
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,853
'That's what I expect'

6
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:35,690
'ln fact this is definitely
the most important day of my life'

7
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,787
'The most important day'

8
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,804
"Here we go"

9
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,471
"Here we go"

10
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,848
"Here we go"

11
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,727
"Beat the bass...Party is on"

12
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,105
"Everybody...run now"

13
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,752
'Before one could wink
the life of a person could change'

14
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,217
'lt was almost like that
in my case too'

15
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,654
'To tell you precisely
it happened 18 days before'

16
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,187
'The day Kurien and Kumar
came to meet me at my office'

17
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,500
Because brother Kurien is with me...

18
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,437
...hope you would guess
the purpose of our visit

19
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:01,479
Mr.Vijay you know
brother is in troubles

20
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,775
I know

21
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,077
To tell you the truth

22
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,553
I was wondering if I can donate
my kidney to relieve him from his troubles

23
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,851
Is that made
to be funny Mr.Vijay?

24
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,016
Why did you not relish it?

25
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:19,857
After taking liquid cash from me
have you come with someone to plead

26
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,024
You dirty

27
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,261
What are you doing?
Leave him

28
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,167
Look Mr.Vijay

29
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:32,075
Pavan group of companies MD
C.S.Nambiar has sent me here

30
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,237
Kurien is very close to him

31
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:39,577
In fact sir came to know
about his financial crisis only yesterday

32
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:45,087
Now Nambiar sir is ready to
clear all his liabilities including yours

33
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,751
I am not bothered
about Nambiar or Chakkiar

34
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,126
I must get my money
11280 pounds

35
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,257
Inclusive of today's interest
that is the amount he owes to me

36
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,065
My God! No Kumar however
you calculate it can't be this high

37
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,629
I swear I have paid interest on many
occasions to the tune of 4000 pounds

38
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:06,110
Hey man, don't talk
as if we do cattle business

39
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,908
Do you have any proof
for the payments made?

40
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,744
Proof...now it is-

41
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,183
If you have the proof
then show it to me

42
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,982
Don't simply blabber

43
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,547
If you have something in writing
show it to me man

44
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,685
'l knew Kurien will never
have any such proof'

45
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,660
'lt was not out of
any greed for money...'

46
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,925
'...I inflated 4000 pounds
to the money he owes me'

47
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,866
'Because Kurien has troubled me
so much by not paying my dues'

48
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,598
'Besides since Pavan group
companies have intervened...'

49
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,732
'...I guessed they might
pay whatever I demand'

50
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,036
'But my hunch was wrong'

51
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,738
'They asked forthe account
and things reached to fistfights'

52
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,872
'Finally that scene came to
an end this way'

53
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,611
Kurien on his strength
you can go now

54
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,916
But I know the place where your
wife and children live in lndia

55
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,751
I will settle scores
at our land

56
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,950
Nothing Kurien brother
He can't do anything

57
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,788
Before that he would
realise what we are

58
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:58,227
Will you and Nambiar
take me by the horns?

59
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,229
Go man

60
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,061
- Let's see
- We can

61
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,795
He does not know about CS

62
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,894
Come, let's go

63
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,301
'Out of my excitement
that day I was hostile to Kumar'

64
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,871
'But on second thoughts
I realised it was a big folly'

65
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:21,648
'Just like wiping a drop
of water from his tache...'

66
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,588
'...he could wipe me out forever'

67
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,785
'Kumar's boss was so
powerful C.S.Nambiar'

68
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,633
You are greed for money

69
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,669
Take it from me you would flourish
only when you get rid of that

70
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,932
Francis brother how can
you also talk like this?

71
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,006
What else can I do?

72
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,133
You do all nonsense
and come to me

73
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,235
I am not St.Francis to
solve all your problems

74
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,679
I am an ordinary
mortal Francis

75
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,082
Earlier also I have intervened
in many issues created by you

76
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,643
On that score I have earned
many enemies too

77
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,316
But this time I am very
sorry to say I will not intervene

78
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,825
Because the opponent
this time is Nambiar

79
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,895
I can't shut my shop dear

80
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,760
You may please carry on

81
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,663
Francis brother-

82
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,258
First he would
come to my office

83
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,271
Then drag me in to this
and the flame would engulf

84
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,806
Let me tell you brother

85
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,908
Yes Francis brother

86
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,182
Vijay, Nambiar called me

87
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:34,659
He wants to meet you in
the Croydon park club at tomorrow 2 p.m

88
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,922
- What for...?
- He only knows about it

89
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:40,090
He asked me about
our acquaintance

90
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,294
I told him we have just
met in some social gatherings

91
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,370
You don't give
a different picture to him

92
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,700
What would he think of me?

93
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,966
- What?
- Don't forget

94
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,405
Tomorrow noon at 2 PM

95
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,841
Do as I explained
Good luck!

96
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,105
No brother, l-

97
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,340
Hello...hello?

98
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,022
'l pondered over it
the whole night'

99
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,326
'Finally I decided
come what may...'

100
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,799
'To go and meet
Mr.C.S.Nambiar'

101
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:39,148
"Everybody...run now"

102
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,452
Excuse me

103
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,020
- Mr.C.S.Nambiar
- He is there

104
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,793
- Thank you
- Welcome

105
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:04,012
- Nambiar sir
-Yes

106
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,785
- I am Vijay Das
- Oh

107
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,184
You are bang on time

108
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,451
Good

109
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,956
The privilege is mine, sir

110
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,924
Sit

111
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,018
So how are things?

112
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,981
- Going on, sir
- Good

113
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,816
You should have guessed by now
why I wanted to meet you?

114
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,025
Kurien brother is like
a godfatherto me

115
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,035
You knowthose days
when I came to London...

116
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,900
...he helped me quite a lot

117
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:04,408
No sir, actually it was a mistake

118
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,544
Have you seen this?

119
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:14,575
Central London's private
investigation agency called Wheelers...

120
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:19,852
...on my instruction inquired
about you and has sent this mail to me

121
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:37,135
In 2003 November on a student Visa
from lndia you have come to London

122
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,540
Is that correct?

123
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:54,188
But for many including me the earlier days
in London were not so pleasant

124
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,491
Might have been so
for you too, right?

125
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,440
Wash room assistant
kitchen assistant

126
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,669
Barman and many
jobs of this type

127
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:18,077
During that time you met
solicitor Francis of Eastham

128
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,244
That was a big
turning point in your life

129
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,890
You are right, sir

130
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,221
After coming to London

131
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:35,290
Francis brother gave me a job
which I could proudly mention to others

132
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:42,273
Perhaps out of his fear for me
he did not say all these to me yesterday

133
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,371
Anyway at that point
through advocate Francis...

134
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,110
...you took over a loss making
corner shop and started running it

135
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:58,246
It was your good fortune
that the shop started making profits

136
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:04,027
And now in many areas of East London's
you have 10 to 12 corner shops

137
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,927
Besides you run
a money lending enterprise

138
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,993
So Vijay Das is flying high

139
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,040
- lsn't it?
- Nothing like that, sir

140
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,597
Sir, before you-

141
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:23,177
I am going through that mail
my rage about you vanished

142
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:28,208
Because what I read was
my own story 30 years ago

143
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,083
Those days it was
Kurien brother for me

144
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,988
Now it is Francis
that was the difference

145
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,565
I have earned enough

146
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:45,467
I have lost the passion
to earn more long ago

147
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:49,633
Because I could sustain
my hard earned money

148
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,078
I had lots of tragedies in family life

149
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,637
5 years ago
I lost my wife

150
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:01,410
The very next year
in an accident I lost my son too

151
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,216
He was only 26

152
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,323
Now my only solace
is my daughter Pavitra

153
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:12,057
A guy who knows everything
the tricks and turns of business...

154
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,156
...should become her life partner

155
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,756
I am very particular about it

156
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,532
Then only my hard earned
wealth would sustain

157
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:30,312
My quick decisions and intuitions
were always right in my life

158
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,646
On such an intuition
I am asking you

159
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,278
Can you marry my daughter?

160
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,392
Sir?

161
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,128
'l first thought Nambiar
was fooling me'

162
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:58,608
'But I realised it was not so when
we both reached Croydon High street'

163
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:17,292
To show an interesting scene
I have brought you here

164
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:23,601
The sole heir of a business empire
worth 5000 million pounds...

165
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,160
...is begging there in the streets

166
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,829
She is my biggest
problem now

167
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,669
Her charity
and literature antics

168
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,442
I can at least tolerate

169
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,143
But see this

170
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:19,885
"Along the lake I see a heart throbbing
in sandy wind through the deserts"

171
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,691
Who is this?

172
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,889
He is from Kerala
Surendran Kanjani

173
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,930
My daughter's
ex boy friend

174
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:37,666
"The grief of break up that shows up
in your face rises up like a tide before me"

175
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:45,740
"My unchanged love
I dedicate as a poem"

176
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,251
They have not met
even once in person

177
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,551
Through some social networking site
they became friends

178
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:01,495
Until few days ago she said
she will live only with him

179
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,531
Do you know one thing?

180
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:11,474
These days I wake up with a shudder
seeing this guy's face in my dream

181
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,519
They had an argument over
one of the verses in Surendran's poem

182
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,564
Now they have
parted ways totally

183
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:36,260
This is the right time
for me to present you before her

184
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,903
But before that I have
to know your answer

185
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,339
That sir

186
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,308
All on a sudden
if you ask me

187
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,210
No no, I don't want you
to tell me now

188
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,271
You can take your
own sweet time

189
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,778
'lncluding Scotland's 3 distilleries'

190
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,945
'lf I am to borrow
Nambiar's words sole heir...

191
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,218
...of 5000 million pound
worth business empire'

192
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:04,625
'Let her be Surendran Kanjani's
or any dirty fellows ex love'

193
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,960
'lt is not an issue
at all for me'

194
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,900
'Though I said to Nambiar I would think
about it it was just a pretence'

195
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,530
'To be frank I could
not sleep that day'

196
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:18,575
'Next day morning I called Nambiar
and told him about my consent'

197
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:22,704
'Perhaps he was more sure
about my likely response'

198
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:27,309
'l felt my response
did not excite him'

199
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,718
'But the very next day itself'

200
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,519
'l witnessed Nambiar
in an ecstatic mood'

201
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,026
Now I am certain
this will happen

202
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:40,861
Without any reason normally
she opposes whatever I say

203
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:44,265
When I said this to her
she laughed for some time...

204
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,463
...but did not say
a word objecting it

205
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,968
Why did she laugh?

206
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,372
You must ask her

207
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:55,744
Anyway she said she would
like to spend a day with you

208
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,304
That itself is a great thing

209
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,747
What would be
the purpose sir?

210
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,786
Mainly could be
to study you

211
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,353
Anyway your day
with her is very crucial

212
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,857
So make it a good day

213
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,339
'Nambiar said this
day is decisive'

214
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,312
'And this is that day'

215
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:35,411
'Perhaps whicheverway this day could
become an unforgettable day in my life'

216
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:40,618
'As I said this is definitely
the most important day of my life'

217
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,122
And have you
met the banker?

218
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,526
Go meet them

219
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,890
- Good morning, sir
- Good morning Vijay

220
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:14,618
Coffee?

221
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,718
No, sir
I am already late

222
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,021
Vijay, don't you
remember Kumar?

223
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,086
Why not?

224
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,793
Daughter would be there
near her mother's tomb

225
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,073
- Hi
- Hi

226
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,938
- I am Vijay Das
- I am Pavitra

227
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,770
Hope daddy would
have told you

228
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,246
Yeah, he told me

229
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:22,514
But Vijay, daddy said
you would come at 10 o'clock

230
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,020
But now it is

231
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:27,189
Are you always like this
or is it just one off?

232
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,123
No not like that

233
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,092
I was rushing
but somehow I am late

234
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,720
- Sorry
- Okay

235
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,162
- Let's go
- Okay

236
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:05,619
By the way Pavitra I am also
very much interested in charity

237
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:09,565
- But I don't find time
- Oh Really?

238
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,602
-Yeah
- Then

239
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,197
This is our pink day
celebration coupon

240
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,571
Let the start be
from you Vijay

241
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,575
Sure

242
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,738
Not any meager amount
It is 1000 pounds

243
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,948
- How much...?
- 1000 pounds

244
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,018
Why not?

245
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:39,927
How should l
pay this amount?

246
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,226
That's ok

247
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,962
Before you leave
I would collect it from you

248
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,850
Daddy would have
told you about

249
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,686
He did say and I had
an hearty laugh too

250
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:21,702
Who could be that big fool
who likes to propose to a girl like me

251
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,934
That made me laugh

252
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,637
Sorry, I didn't mean that way

253
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:30,408
For a person like you
I am neverthe right girl

254
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:36,083
Atypical family life with hubby
and kids is not my cup of tea Vijay

255
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,880
To lean on
when I become tired

256
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,948
I need a partner in life
to stand by my side

257
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,960
I am a socially
committed person

258
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,963
So my family life
should not go beyond that

259
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,934
And one more thing is...

260
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,362
...as the in law of
the immensely rich C.S.Nambiar

261
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,375
...my would be life partner
cannot enjoy anything

262
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,106
Because after daddy's life time...

263
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,081
...Pavan group of companies
would be made a charitable organisation

264
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,981
That is my decision

265
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,215
- Sorry
- It's ok

266
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,756
So Vijay, ponder
over it thoroughly

267
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:19,764
I also need time to understand
if you would be compatible to me

268
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,322
Don't worry

269
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,891
Without your knowledge
I would understand you

270
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:36,346
She is truly worthy of
being Nambiar's daughter

271
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,972
No doubt

272
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:10,171
"Miniscule flashes from your eyes
before me turned as gilded plumes!"

273
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:14,048
"Why didn't you sport
the whitish smile?"

274
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,179
"You are lovely
even in dreams"

275
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:21,452
"At dawn
you are a breeze"

276
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,790
"Your soft foot taps
are rhythmic"

277
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,056
"Oh Oh..."

278
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,462
"l just want to
do this baby"

279
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,936
"Come romantically"

280
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:38,164
"ln night's dreamy chariot
on this shore"

281
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:18,812
"To see and hearyou..."

282
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:28,349
"l swam across
this longish night's ocean"

283
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:38,834
"Moonlight lily's will
bloom in this garden"

284
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:44,933
"Will you come with love?"

285
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,478
"At dawn
you are a breeze"

286
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,982
"Your soft foot taps
are rhythmic"

287
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,278
"Oh Oh..."

288
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,820
"l just want to
do this baby"

289
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:00,449
"Come romantically"

290
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:05,857
"ln nights dreamy chariot
on this shore"

291
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,008
'Harry!'

292
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:47,128
"lf you would keep company..."

293
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:55,977
"...we would plunge in
thousand moonlit nights"

294
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:07,185
"lf you would coalesce with me
even daylights could turn..."

295
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:11,422
"...thousand lovely dreams!"

296
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:17,624
"At dawn
you are a breeze"

297
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,263
"Your soft foot taps
are rhythmic"

298
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:30,245
"Miniscule flashes from your eyes
before me turned as gilded plumes"

299
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:34,183
"Why didn't you sport
the whitish smile"

300
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,415
"You are lovely
even in dreams"

301
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:41,447
"At dawn
you are a breeze"

302
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,962
"Your soft foot taps
are rhythmic"

303
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,257
"Oh Oh..."

304
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,958
"l just want to
do this baby"

305
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:53,499
"Come romantically"

306
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,169
"ln nights dreamy chariot
on this shore"

307
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,269
- Hello, sir
- Why didn't you call me?

308
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,139
Sorry, sir

309
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,235
On the way
I went to my office

310
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,746
- I had some work to do
- What happened?

311
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,215
-What did Pavi say?
- She said many things

312
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:14,717
But I didn't
understand anything, sir

313
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,084
But one thing has
become very clear

314
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,313
You have given me
a good assignment

315
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,826
Vijay, don't become
despair at the start itself

316
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,188
Did I not tell you
that is her character?

317
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,788
You did say but I didn't
expect this much

318
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,334
You do one thing
Call her now

319
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,302
What for, sir?

320
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,065
Should I teach
you that too?

321
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,667
Tell her you can never forget
the day you have spent with her

322
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,210
Tell her you are
grateful to her for that

323
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,474
Just say something
like this romantically

324
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,040
Should I do that sir?

325
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,482
Then do as you like

326
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,680
Not like that sir
I will call her

327
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,213
- Please text me her number
- Okay, I will send it to you

328
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,454
What is wrong
with this man?

329
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,861
Let it be anything

330
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,239
- Hello?
- Hello Pavitra

331
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,868
I am Vijay here

332
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,577
Why at this time Vijay?

333
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,442
I haven't yet
reached home

334
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,414
Just crossed Houghton park

335
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,383
- So what...?
- Nothing for that

336
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,851
Because I was
driving in solitude...

337
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,548
...I was thinking about
the day we spent together

338
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,454
It was really
beautiful you know

339
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,823
I...I had a lot of fun

340
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,429
Hello?

341
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,672
Hello?

342
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,842
Hello Vijay?

343
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,344
Are you there?

344
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,510
Pavitra...

345
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,679
Vijay, what's happening there?

346
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,284
My...my car

347
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,755
I just hit someone

348
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,832
Oh God! Then?

349
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,267
Seems the person is dead

350
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,570
No movement
lying on road

351
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:22,511
Might be unconscious
Get down and check, Vijay

352
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,546
Pavitra, that-

353
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,909
- Should I do that?
-You must

354
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,510
It's a question of
someone's life

355
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,852
Don't waste time, go
Please

356
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,007
Hello?

357
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,248
- Hello?
- Hello Pavitra

358
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,442
Vijay, you need not
have any fears

359
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:38,784
I have informed everything
including your full details to 999

360
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,725
Police would reach there now

361
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,352
Pavitra, why did you do that?

362
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:23,848
Hello?

363
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,411
Where were you?

364
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:36,131
Hello, seems the owner of this phone
met with an accident few minutes ago

365
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,691
- Who are you?
- Me...?

366
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:43,103
I was at the spot
at that time

367
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,607
Then, where is she now?

368
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,200
Anything serious?

369
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,470
Nothing to worry

370
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,415
Police came and took her
in an ambulance

371
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,577
Can you find out
which hospital?

372
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,677
They moved towards Basildon

373
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,656
So it could be
the NHS hospital there

374
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,091
Okay

375
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,060
I would come now

376
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,096
Hello, Vijay tell me
I was waiting for your call

377
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,540
- What happened afterwards?
- Everything is okay, Pavitra

378
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,942
Actually she was
a Malayali girl

379
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,240
What a coincidence!

380
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,918
With great difficulty I managed to find out
the girls relatives and informed them

381
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,512
Now they will take care of her
We don't have to worry about anything

382
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:35,252
- Where are you now?
- I am going home

383
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,554
Vijay, what are you talking?
Your car has hit her

384
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,997
So you have
a responsibility to her

385
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,168
No, I have a-

386
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:49,263
Business people don't have
any human consideration

387
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:53,575
If you can't go tell me the hospital
where she is taken to...

388
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:54,941
...I would go there

389
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,479
No no
You need not go

390
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,275
I would go

391
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,746
I have already turned my car
I am on my way actually

392
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:03,616
Good

393
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:09,082
Vijay, it is not about making money
You must be a humane

394
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,593
Sure, I know that
Of course

395
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,688
However late it may be
as soon as you reach hospital call me

396
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,756
- Okay?
- Okay, Pavitra

397
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:27,501
Here comes the next bother
seems this is a worst day for me

398
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,641
Hello?

399
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:33,581
- Did you get any other information?
- Actually I am going to the hospital

400
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,710
- So would you be there?
- Yes, I would be there

401
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,310
- I would reach now
- Okay

402
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:42,792
If hospital wants details
about her what should I tell them?

403
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,626
I mean her name
where is she working such details

404
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,028
She is a nurse

405
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,596
She was directly
recruited by NHS...

406
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:53,228
...she has just landed
today noon from lndia

407
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:58,006
Her name is Merin
Merin Lissa John

408
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:03,206
- Gracy sister
-You toothy

409
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,106
I thought you would
have forgotten my arrival

410
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:08,838
How can I forget you, dear?

411
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,846
It is very chill here

412
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:14,042
Then what would you say
about the real cold season?

413
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:16,609
This is the normal climate here

414
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,751
Where is Thambi Kuttychayan?

415
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,122
Hi baby

416
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,899
- Hello
- Move man

417
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,130
Come on...come on

418
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,298
You scoundrel

419
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:39,867
Horrible

420
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,434
Here comes your Thambi Kuttychayan

421
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,706
Poor guy! He is looking foryou

422
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,116
Dear Merin

423
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:54,281
O lord!
How did you get here?

424
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,350
He will try to utilise the opportunity
You better be prepared

425
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:00,226
- Dear...!
- Thambi Kuttychayan

426
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,166
Hope the journey
was comfortable

427
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,292
Great

428
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:08,835
Then, let's go

429
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,388
It's so beautiful out here

430
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,889
Do you like?

431
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,185
This is nothing

432
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:31,955
If you want to see the beauty of Britain
you must go to the countryside

433
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,055
One day I would
take you there

434
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:41,300
How is your
online paper in UK?

435
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,202
That's great

436
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,798
UK Malayali's need
my paper early morning

437
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,743
'Malayali at Britain'
to ease themselves

438
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:49,972
They can't live without it

439
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:50,741
That's right

440
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:53,214
The paper is best
suited for that time

441
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:03,952
Anyway, your trip to this place would
have relieved Johnny uncle greatly

442
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,824
How will he get
relief sister?

443
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:10,060
Even if I toil here for 10 years
the debts cannot be cleared

444
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,159
Along with that Malu's education
is also to be taken care of

445
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:17,196
Relax, any way God has
given you the life you wanted

446
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,902
He would have decided
on the rest also

447
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:45,998
Few nurses known to me stay here
All of them are Malayali's

448
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,263
Have you reached?

449
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,304
- Hello
- Hi

450
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,567
Since you didn't turn up
I was about to call you Gracy

451
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,868
- The flight was delayed
- No doubt might have been Air lndia

452
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:54,911
Yes

453
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,378
Dear, the room is on top

454
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,075
Jessy, what do you have?

455
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,118
Dear

456
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,955
Have you packed
a stone mortar inside?

457
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,584
It is very heavy

458
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,860
Merin, she is Jessy

459
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,028
She worked with
me in City hospital

460
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,037
- Which is your town in lndia?
- Koothattukulam

461
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,039
It is time to go for duty

462
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,268
Let us get acquainted
in the evening

463
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,039
- Okay, see you girls
- See you

464
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,815
Sorry, I am little busy

465
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,144
Today it is
my turn in kitchen

466
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,081
I have to finish that
before I leave for wok

467
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,619
- You carry on
- Okay

468
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:41,288
- We would leave now
- Ok, I would call you later

469
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,393
Some money for you

470
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,594
You would get salary
only next month

471
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:53,966
Keep it with you

472
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:58,405
Dear, I would have loved
to keep you with me

473
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,040
You know about it
That may not work out rightly

474
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,105
Don't bother about it, sister

475
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:31,899
380, 400, 420
440, 460, 480, 500

476
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,511
My God
500 pounds

477
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,949
That means
500 x 100

478
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,917
50,000 rupees

479
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,190
- Hello?
- Gracy sister

480
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,091
Why did you give
so much money?

481
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,060
Let it be with you, dear

482
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:57,098
If there is a crisis
I can get from you too

483
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,965
From next month
who do you think you are?

484
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:03,063
Your starting salary
is 2200 pounds

485
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,175
That is peanuts for
money lenders back home

486
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,541
Jeez! Is it like
an anticipatory bail?

487
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,079
Okay

488
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:19,219
Merin, I am going for duty

489
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,018
Food is on the dining table

490
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,354
- Help yourself
- I would, sister

491
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,452
Take rest
Will meet tomorrow

492
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,621
Sister

493
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:30,133
'l just want to
know one thing'

494
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:33,327
'How do you send
money to lndia?'

495
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,702
'ln the next street there is
a Muthoot money transfer'

496
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:40,072
'l normally send
through them'

497
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,804
Gracy sister!

498
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:10,678
Hello Pavitra

499
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,789
I am in the hospital

500
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,719
She has just been
taken in to the HDU

501
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:20,861
Yes!

502
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,321
No, I am waiting outside

503
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:25,594
Sure

504
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:27,568
Okay

505
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,068
Did I talk to you over phone?

506
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:45,537
Yes

507
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,007
What's your name man?

508
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:48,675
What?

509
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,440
I asked what is your name?

510
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,106
Vijay

511
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,443
Where do you
look while driving?

512
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:56,746
Were you drunk?

513
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,920
I am asking you
are you laughing?

514
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,618
You don't know about me

515
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,423
I would thrash you and-

516
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,554
Dear

517
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,723
Take off your hand

518
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,868
I said take off your hand

519
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,104
For the sake of courtesy
I was waiting here...

520
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:25,841
...until someone from
the girl's side come

521
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,785
Nowl feel it was a folly

522
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,562
Hello Mr young entrepreneur

523
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:51,799
Prasad, sir

524
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,772
Your work place is really nice

525
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,744
Thank you, sir
Please

526
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,882
Why this unusual
visit to my office, sir?

527
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:06,445
Vijay, sometime ago you wanted me
to join with you in some liquor business

528
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,787
Why not we think about it now?

529
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:13,018
You then said you are not
keen on that business

530
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,429
when I came to your office
to discuss about it

531
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,991
You insulted and
chucked me out

532
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,799
- Don't you remember that, sir?
- I am extremely sorry Vijay

533
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,703
My mood was very
bad on that day

534
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,174
Please don't take it to heart

535
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,541
That's a...
That's alright

536
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:34,506
I heard a news
A stunning news

537
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:39,145
Your marriage with
C.S's daughter is fixed

538
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:44,058
I tried for this alliance
for my second son

539
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,186
But C.S. turned down then

540
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,430
How did you manage this?

541
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:59,173
So that is what made you keen on this
business proposal once declined by you

542
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,240
What you heard
is true sir but-

543
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,245
Just a minute

544
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,019
- Hello Vijay
- Pavitra

545
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,050
I am at the hospital now

546
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,559
After leaving
the hospital yesterday...

547
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:24,464
...I came to know
you haven't even made a call

548
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,867
- Where are you?
- Pavitra l-

549
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,267
- I am coming there
- Then come fast

550
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,840
Merin's surgery
is going on here

551
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,002
This girl is really

552
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,275
It was Pavitra
Nambiar uncle's daughter

553
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,575
She wants to meet
me immediately

554
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,812
She was pampered
too much by him

555
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:47,118
I am busy with my work
she doesn't understand that

556
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,851
So let me take leave of you

557
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,129
Then about the business
proposal you made

558
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,596
I have to discuss
with Nambiar uncle

559
00:58:56,666 --> 00:59:01,865
He has strictly warned me shouldn't
jump into any undesirable ventures

560
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:03,603
Okay?

561
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,723
Sorry, Pavitra
I am little late

562
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,589
There was heavy
traffic in motorway

563
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,652
It's okay
Surgery is over

564
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,560
Doctor is talking to them

565
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:29,926
Oh

566
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:34,294
She has a fracture on her right leg
and left half of the rib cage

567
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,897
Nothing seem to be worried about
But this...this is unfortunate

568
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:41,239
Could have happened on the impact
or in her attempt to brake falling on

569
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:44,280
However she got a really
bad hit on her right wrist

570
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,783
She has developed a condition
called radial nerve palsy

571
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:49,841
What we call drop wrist

572
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:56,050
In her present condition Merin is
technically paralysed from her wrists down

573
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:58,992
But regarding treatment
for her condition

574
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,723
I am sorry, there is
nothing that we can do

575
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:02,917
How dare you talk
a business deal with me...

576
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,927
...that day Prasad said to me
and chucked me out of his office

577
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,931
And nowto discuss about the same
business deal he has come to my office

578
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,297
More people
would come to you

579
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:17,806
Once this marriage is over why Prasad
all rogues in UK would come to you

580
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,672
Though you are a dirty guy...

581
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:23,769
...you had your share of bad times
in life at lndia and UK

582
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,341
May be God
compensates it this way

583
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,782
One can't say

584
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:33,049
I would have fallen now

585
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:41,754
Vijay, if things should move smoothly
Nambiar's daughter should say 'yes'

586
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:46,024
If she remains like a cat
on the wall, it may not be easy

587
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,865
You need not worry about that

588
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:51,395
Now I know
how to impress her

589
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,768
Yes, brother

590
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:58,775
I have a God sent
opportunity now

591
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:23,834
- Sorry
- It's okay

592
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,266
Hi

593
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,737
Have they just shifted her?

594
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:32,837
Yes

595
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,473
Merin, this is Vijay

596
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:35,983
Hi Merin

597
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,445
Get well soon

598
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:42,146
Thank you

599
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:46,485
Merin that day
it was my car that-

600
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:54,160
I am sorry

601
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:57,369
Did they say anything
about her discharge?

602
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,409
No, minimum she may
have to wait for 2 weeks

603
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,306
Oh

604
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:04,369
On her own she can't
sit up or have food

605
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,245
Some one should be with her
That's the present problem

606
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:11,275
That's not a problem at all
All of us together can manage it

607
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:14,914
Any time you can call me
Always at your service

608
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,790
Will it not be a nuisance
amidst your busy schedule?

609
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,127
Not at all

610
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,761
Wherever I am
I can do my business over phone

611
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:38,171
It is not about making money
One should be a humane is it?

612
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:03,236
"Did you come opening
the glass doors?"

613
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:07,470
"Did you throwfewflowers?"

614
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:12,071
"l cuddled it to my bosom
and lived through it"

615
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:16,881
"But I could not
find you near me"

616
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:26,319
"ln this misty lonesome crave
like a spreading blaze"

617
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:35,929
"ln this deep winter season
you became my passage"

618
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:40,499
"Pristine clouds
come down"

619
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:45,377
"Oh valley
come embrace"

620
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:58,088
"Pristine clouds showerflowers
mist laden ones pristine clouds"

621
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:02,358
"Did you come opening
the glass doors?"

622
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:06,492
"But I could not
find you near me"

623
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:36,421
"The diamond magic
extends to the woods"

624
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:46,135
"ln some reminiscence
the damp creepers slant"

625
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:55,549
"Will a solitary flower's silent smile
make a shower of thousand flowers?"

626
01:05:55,618 --> 01:06:04,993
"Will a solitary soft breeze
whistle thousand songs?"

627
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:14,094
"ls love turned as a gentle incantation
showering day break sun rays?"

628
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:19,105
"Pristine clouds
come down"

629
01:06:19,175 --> 01:06:23,942
"Oh valley
come embrace"

630
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:36,221
"Pristine clouds showerflowers
mist laden ones pristine clouds"

631
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:10,117
"ln the silent clouds where
white pigeons fly"

632
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:19,533
"ln gleeful shores where gilded
cone bearing plants join hands"

633
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:24,663
"Grief gets crumpled
in spring season"

634
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:29,541
"Oh gilded delicate twilight"

635
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:38,816
"Oh good dear here I swim
in the tides of the lake"

636
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:43,549
"When doused in love
it is a hymn"

637
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:47,653
"Do you feel it in heart?"

638
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,759
"Did you come opening
the glass doors?"

639
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:57,635
"But I could not
find you near me"

640
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,376
- Vijay
- Francis brother

641
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,506
-Where are you?
- I am at office

642
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:45,452
I called you to talk about the girl
Merin who met with the accident

643
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:52,357
We made a request to NHS to
meet her hospital and other expenses

644
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,622
- They have rejected it
- Why?

645
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:57,290
Merin came here on receipt
of their offer letter

646
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:58,731
So she is their responsibility

647
01:08:58,834 --> 01:08:59,801
That's all okay

648
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:02,133
But that's not
what the Briton says

649
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:04,672
Merin's accident was
not during duty time

650
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:08,506
Besides she hasn't
yet joined them

651
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:11,478
On that score
they have declined

652
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:17,315
My fear is on the plea she is
physically unfit they may even fire her

653
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:21,550
Jeez! Let God forbid that brother
you must somehow protect her

654
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,852
I will do whatever I can do

655
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:29,329
Anyway your association with Nambiar's
daughter had made you humane

656
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:31,525
That's a good indication

657
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,333
For the first time I see you
worried about another person

658
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:40,573
No, brother
She is a poor girl

659
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:41,610
Okay

660
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,629
Brother, I want to lie down

661
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:13,607
You may take rest
I would sit here quietly

662
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:32,893
Who is it?
Who is calling?

663
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,224
That...

664
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:39,396
From lndia
I will call them later

665
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,999
Dear, you may lie down

666
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:45,603
- Should I help you?
- Not required

667
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:48,768
No problem
I would help you

668
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:52,871
If it is not inconvenient, can you
please get me some hot water?

669
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:56,247
Why do you say this?
Will I not do anything foryou?

670
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,013
I would get you now?

671
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,745
- Hello
- Sorry

672
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:38,526
I was in a situation
where I couldn't attend the call

673
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:40,755
That's why l
hung up the phone

674
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,389
What is that situation that
you couldn't attend a call?

675
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:44,454
That...

676
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,860
Thambi Kuttychayan is here

677
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,403
Has he gone?

678
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:52,702
No, seems he would not leave

679
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:54,709
He is drunk too

680
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:57,940
- Is there no one else?
- No, all of them are on duty

681
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:08,651
Merin dear, is the heat sufficient?

682
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:09,986
Enough...!

683
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:13,688
No...no
I would hold it for you

684
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:14,793
Have it!

685
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:16,353
No, I would do it myself

686
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:19,094
Have it, dear
Am I a stranger to you?

687
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,563
Take it away

688
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:24,071
That 's gone
What's this, dear?

689
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:28,003
You sit in that chair
Else I would call Gracy sister

690
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,068
Today her duty is in OTl

691
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:32,943
So your call may
not reach her

692
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:39,786
Who is it?

693
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:43,625
Damn it

694
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,319
Might be Jessy sister

695
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,656
Open the door

696
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,521
No, else I would go

697
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,692
You need not
I would go

698
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,051
What a surprise
Thambi Kuttychayan?

699
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:23,096
You would have come
probably to get rid of the cool

700
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,157
- What do you want?
- Move away, brother

701
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,994
Where is Merin?

702
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,597
She must be upstairs

703
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:34,665
- I would see her there
- What do you mean man?

704
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,501
Stay there

705
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:38,443
Hai Merin

706
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:41,881
How dare he walks in
where the inmates are only women

707
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,180
I want to see
what you would do

708
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,114
Hi

709
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,179
Dear, what is he doing here?

710
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,083
What?

711
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:52,821
- What have you got to do here?
- Gosh I forgot to tell him about that

712
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,055
- Brother, come
- What for?

713
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:56,153
Let me tell you
why I came?

714
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,563
Come on, brother
Merin, just a minute

715
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:21,517
It's burning

716
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,888
Your infliction is
because of the cold

717
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:26,928
If you get a good burn
you will get cured

718
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:35,897
If I come to knowyou approached
the girl again with your dirty games

719
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:39,805
The next day your paper
would publish your obituary

720
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,130
He has gone

721
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:06,099
He has gone to get
some medicine urgently

722
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:10,662
Anyway I would leave this place
only after someone returns from duty

723
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,906
Shall I tell you what is
in your mind now?

724
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:23,708
Are you thinking this guy
is a bigger bother than Thambi Kutty?

725
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:31,182
It is a call from lndia

726
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:32,555
Just a minute

727
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:38,158
Dad

728
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:39,890
No

729
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,830
I am on duty

730
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,139
No, didn't get yet

731
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:55,845
I know about it

732
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,852
Will I not send when I get?

733
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:01,756
Oh sorry sorry

734
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:06,260
I would start writing
from tomorrow in detail

735
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,993
So I will call later, okay?

736
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:25,177
It's a habit from the days
I studied nursing at Mangalore

737
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,580
No matter how many
times I talk over phone

738
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:32,142
If he doesn't read
a letter from me...

739
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:34,347
...he does not get satisfied

740
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,621
Then?

741
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:41,857
Have you not informed
them about the accident?

742
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:45,158
No...not because of anything else

743
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:50,830
Few years ago my dad
owned 10 to 12 buses

744
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,601
Later we lost every thing

745
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:58,977
Though dad would not agree after
my mom's death he screwed up the business

746
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:03,874
On few occasions when he
could not manage to hold on

747
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:07,717
He even tried
to commit suicide

748
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:13,020
When I got a job here
after a very long time...

749
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,858
...I saw him having
a hearty laugh

750
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:20,027
He believes this would resolve
all his problems

751
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:27,208
But if he comes to
know about this

752
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,773
I fear Vijay
My dad would...

753
01:17:58,306 --> 01:17:59,364
Merin

754
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:16,718
Merin

755
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:21,020
You need not worry

756
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:26,757
Don't ever think
there is no one for you

757
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:29,735
We are all-

758
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:37,402
Merin

759
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:49,348
Merin

760
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,061
'Why this sentiment
for an interest monster?'

761
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:36,934
'To begin with that
was my thought too'

762
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:39,200
'But first time in my life'

763
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:43,937
'My heart has over stepped
a line drawn by my intellect'

764
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:05,356
Brother...

765
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:07,264
Which is the way
to Kallupara?

766
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:08,825
Go straight!

767
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,132
Comes Paipadu and Kaviyur

768
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:12,139
From Kaviyur turn left
you would reach Kallupara

769
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,139
Thanks, sir

770
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:18,479
I am not familiar
with the southern side

771
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,946
Usually my trips are
on the northern side

772
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:23,348
Do some southern
trips too Suguna

773
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:24,976
For a change

774
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,451
I would do it, sir

775
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:41,829
To Mr.John Daniel...

776
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:42,801
To

777
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:44,030
Mr.

778
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,237
John...

779
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:46,137
Daniel...

780
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:47,505
Mattathu house...

781
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:49,607
Mattathu...

782
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,104
house...

783
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:54,876
Kallupara P.O

784
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:57,975
Kallupara...
P.O

785
01:20:58,053 --> 01:20:59,111
Thiruvalla

786
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:03,850
Thiru...valla...

787
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,187
That's enough

788
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:18,601
Dad...!
I honour my promise

789
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:20,538
I...

790
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,075
honour...

791
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:28,082
...my promise

792
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:33,087
With in 10 days you
would get this letter

793
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:35,281
With in 10 days...

794
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:38,050
you would...

795
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:43,062
...get this letter

796
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:46,498
I write this trusting you

797
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:49,402
On reaching lndia
in your busy schedule...

798
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,234
...if you forget to post this

799
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:53,365
I would cut a sorry
figure before dad

800
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:54,669
That would never happen

801
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,174
The moment I get down
from flight at Nedumbassery

802
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,872
I would post this letter

803
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:00,039
That will do

804
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:02,240
Then write the rest

805
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:09,452
'Though I said that to Merin'

806
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:13,085
'l decided much earlier
on reaching lndia'

807
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:16,653
'This letter should be personally
delivered to her house'

808
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:34,505
'Doing oblation
for my dad and mom'

809
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:37,449
'Then few sundry
business dealings'

810
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:41,517
'Collecting money owed by
London's Mohan Das in pounds...'

811
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:45,252
'...as lndian rupees
from his brother-in-law'

812
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,295
'From there
straight to Kallupara'

813
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:51,389
'To Mattathu...
John Daniel's house'

814
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:56,169
I can't wait any more John

815
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:58,364
I must get her
number today

816
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:01,441
Even if it means
losing few rupees

817
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:03,477
I want to know
the real situation

818
01:23:03,578 --> 01:23:08,345
Only because of her promise
I am tolerating you

819
01:23:09,617 --> 01:23:12,279
Thomas! She wouldn't
do it deliberately...

820
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,649
There might be some...

821
01:23:13,722 --> 01:23:15,053
Damn with her situation!

822
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:19,582
When I filed a case the other day
everyone including you blamed me

823
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:23,563
I knew it would
happen like this only

824
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,203
Some one has come there

825
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:31,499
Let me check dad

826
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:34,172
Girl...Ieave that
broom here

827
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,069
- Keep it with you
- Damn it...!

828
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:53,994
- Is this Merin's house?
-Yes

829
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,629
Greet you

830
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,531
I am Vijay
Vijay Das

831
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:03,571
Coming from London
I am Merin's friend

832
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,200
- I am Merin's dad
- I understood

833
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:07,571
Come inside

834
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:12,805
Please sit down

835
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:24,615
- Malu...right?
-Yes

836
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,250
Merin has said about you

837
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:27,726
Few chocolates

838
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:29,559
Specially sent
by your sister

839
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:30,461
Take it

840
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:38,304
Thanks

841
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:43,272
If I am not mistaken
may I know about this sir

842
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:45,835
I am Thomas
their neighbour

843
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,605
What do you do...?

844
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:51,481
If I tell you what I do
it would appear a dirty one...

845
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:54,818
...from your point of view
Money lending

846
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:01,221
How about the local market here?

847
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:03,264
Is there a good scope?

848
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:04,593
No scope at all

849
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:07,658
Certain dirty
fellows don't repay

850
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:16,503
Merin has sent
this for you!

851
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:39,766
Except the letter and chocolates
didn't she give anything else?

852
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:44,298
Other than that...

853
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:48,401
He may be ashamed
to talk about that!

854
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:50,612
But I can talk about that

855
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:53,103
Many times he has
borrowed money from me

856
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:55,741
Its interest and
interest accrued on interest

857
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:58,341
He owes me
a considerable amount!

858
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:03,356
That girl promised to repay me
once she gets the London job

859
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:06,222
I stayed quiet temporarily
on her assurance!

860
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:10,230
But it is 2 months
since she left!

861
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:13,165
But I haven't got a penny yet!

862
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,498
I strongly suspect

863
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:19,539
It is a drama enacted
by all of them!

864
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:27,441
You have reminded me
I just forgot about it

865
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:30,848
Merin has handed over to me
cash received as salary!

866
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:32,808
Please

867
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,218
Give that to me

868
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:36,483
How can you forget
such things young man?

869
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:39,152
Doesn't matter
It is suffice for 1 month's interest

870
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:41,387
So Johnny I am moving

871
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,362
There are some
more bad debtors

872
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:45,331
So I take leave of you son

873
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,231
That's okay!

874
01:27:02,584 --> 01:27:08,545
You said you have
umpteen jobs back in lndia

875
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:12,690
But without informing me
you have gone to my house

876
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,728
Given them the cash
you had and has...

877
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:17,765
...returned with
snacks from there!

878
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:18,924
Are you mad...?

879
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:20,958
Yes, a little?

880
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:22,667
It is a recent affliction!

881
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,739
Let me tell you...

882
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:29,903
To get that money back you may
have to wait for a long time!

883
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:32,877
I can wait

884
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:08,538
"To remember you forever
deep down was this verse written"

885
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:18,888
"Falling today on this foggy
gilded field is a gleaming verse"

886
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:24,061
"Today love is
dawn's ray of light"

887
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:29,464
"With a row of celestial trees
spreading leaves"

888
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:33,064
"The song sinks in..."

889
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:43,041
"...just to hear"

890
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:53,921
"Gently...to whistle"

891
01:28:53,995 --> 01:29:02,733
"To blend I am craving"

892
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:12,809
"To blend I am craving"

893
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:50,613
"l sawtoday a foggy droplet
gushing as a love stream"

894
01:29:51,052 --> 01:30:00,825
"Here I come as the rainy
season dusk and search for you"

895
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:11,397
"Don't know about
this lonely world"

896
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:22,411
"l can't but express the crave
that spreads my soul!"

897
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:33,985
"To remember you forever deep down
was this verse written"

898
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:44,832
"Falling today on this foggy
gilded field is a gleaming verse"

899
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:49,707
"Today love is
dawn's ray of light"

900
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:55,044
"With a row of celestial trees
spreading leaves"

901
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:58,984
"The song sinks in..."

902
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:09,523
"...just to hear"

903
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:19,700
"Gently...to whistle"

904
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:28,442
"To blend I am craving"

905
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:39,557
"To blend I am craving"

906
01:31:39,627 --> 01:31:44,724
"l am craving"

907
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,102
Merin

908
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:52,473
Come here!

909
01:31:56,577 --> 01:31:57,271
What is it, sister?

910
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:58,672
Did you see this?

911
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,710
'Young industrialist
cruelly shatters Merin's life'

912
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:05,980
This is done by
Thambi Kuttychayan!

913
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:18,056
Because of him a tragic
incident happened in Merin's life

914
01:32:18,132 --> 01:32:20,566
But he has no
guilty conscience

915
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:24,093
Taking advantage of this in many
other ways he is trying to utilise Merin

916
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:27,106
Our secret reports confirm this

917
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:30,735
He is following the business
culture of the lndian Mafia

918
01:32:30,845 --> 01:32:34,975
He has become a shame and threat
to all Malayali's in UK!

919
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:43,915
Good morning

920
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:46,086
Good morning, sir!

921
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:54,896
Hello, sir

922
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:56,299
Hello Vijay
Where are you?

923
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:56,995
At home?

924
01:32:57,104 --> 01:32:59,299
No, sir...I just walked
into my office

925
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:01,599
Good, I want to
meet you right now

926
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:02,608
It's very urgent

927
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:04,076
Can you come to Derby Hotel?

928
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:05,076
Sure, sir

929
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:06,943
I will be there in 20

930
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:08,208
Thank you, Vijay

931
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,766
- Welcome
- Thank you

932
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:51,822
- Hello, Vijay
- Hi, sir

933
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:53,984
Come, sit down!

934
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,826
Meet my friends
from Scotland

935
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:01,094
- Mr.Loly
- Hi

936
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:02,157
- Mr.Steve
- Hi

937
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:03,134
And Mr.Robins

938
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:04,171
- Hi
- Hi

939
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:05,671
Could I have the file please?

940
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:06,672
Sure

941
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:10,200
They want your signature

942
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:19,812
Sir! This is...

943
01:34:19,887 --> 01:34:20,911
Don't worry

944
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:22,683
Because I said to you

945
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:25,190
You need not sign without
knowing what it is all about

946
01:34:25,259 --> 01:34:28,888
In Scotland's lnverness
there is Ben Nevis distillery

947
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:30,988
It is taken on lease
in your name

948
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:32,293
This is an agreement for that

949
01:34:33,434 --> 01:34:36,835
This lease agreement is
to solve few legal problems

950
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:41,172
Afterwards you can make
the distillery your own!

951
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:48,274
Sir I am...

952
01:34:49,984 --> 01:34:52,782
...not that much prepared

953
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:55,447
Mr.Vijay, I wanted
only your signature

954
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,681
So forget about
the other things

955
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:02,127
Yes, man...this is
my gift to you

956
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:05,222
After a very long time...

957
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,063
...my daughter said to me
a very glad news!

958
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:14,231
Now she is ready
to marry you!

959
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,004
Though you are
outwardly ambitious

960
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:24,476
She says you are
good at heart

961
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,346
I thought your well wisher

962
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:28,922
Francis must witness this

963
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:31,889
So I invited him too

964
01:35:31,959 --> 01:35:33,290
Don't delay it any further

965
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,486
Come on, sign it

966
01:35:34,762 --> 01:35:35,786
Sir...!

967
01:35:36,964 --> 01:35:37,931
Just a minute

968
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:39,124
Sure...no problem

969
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:43,401
Francis brother
Please come with me!

970
01:35:43,471 --> 01:35:45,371
- What's it?
- Please come

971
01:35:46,774 --> 01:35:48,071
Might be to get my blessing

972
01:35:48,142 --> 01:35:49,837
- One minute
- Oh sure!

973
01:35:56,117 --> 01:35:57,880
Here is my legs
Come on do it

974
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:00,745
- What...?
- Blessing!

975
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:02,720
It is not that Francis brother

976
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:04,189
Then what?

977
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,352
I won't sign that agreement

978
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:09,258
Why...?

979
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:14,232
What about Merin, brother?

980
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:19,729
So as I guessed Thambi kutty's
news item was not wrong!

981
01:36:19,807 --> 01:36:20,899
Is that so?

982
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:25,735
Then tell this
to Nambiar also

983
01:36:25,813 --> 01:36:27,337
Few minutes ago...

984
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:29,177
...he asked about this
to me casually!

985
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:30,945
- Francis brother l...
- What else is this?

986
01:36:31,018 --> 01:36:33,009
Don't you think what
you said now is lousy?

987
01:36:33,087 --> 01:36:36,818
All those in London who knows you both
know very well about this proposal!

988
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:38,950
Until nowthe girl
was blocking this move

989
01:36:39,059 --> 01:36:40,492
But nowwhen she agrees you

990
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:43,927
I warn you again
You don't know about Nambiar

991
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:49,834
Dear Vijay

992
01:36:49,937 --> 01:36:51,404
Merin is a good girl

993
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:54,771
Not merely you
all of us like her

994
01:36:55,009 --> 01:36:57,773
But it is all out of sympathy

995
01:36:58,913 --> 01:37:01,848
Since I knowyou very well

996
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:03,213
I again tell you for sure

997
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:06,947
Out of excitement
declining the prosperity...

998
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:09,012
...that comes your way
if you marry Merin

999
01:37:09,089 --> 01:37:12,058
Very soon you will regret forthat

1000
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:15,021
You will hate her
That is your nature

1001
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:17,893
But Francis brother
her present plight

1002
01:37:18,098 --> 01:37:19,326
I understand

1003
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:22,528
But Vijay...this is not
a solution for that

1004
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:24,934
You help her financially

1005
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:27,940
Give her and her family
all that is required for sustenance

1006
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:30,374
This alliance will get you
more than you require

1007
01:37:30,444 --> 01:37:31,911
What else you want?

1008
01:37:34,915 --> 01:37:37,509
If we delay any further
Nambiar would get suspicious

1009
01:37:37,585 --> 01:37:38,415
Come

1010
01:38:30,271 --> 01:38:31,295
Merin

1011
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:35,266
This is for you

1012
01:38:35,342 --> 01:38:37,606
- Is it for me?
-Yes, it is from NHS

1013
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:38,975
Shall I open it?

1014
01:39:05,306 --> 01:39:07,331
From what Nambiar said...

1015
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:09,638
...I think the marriage
date is approaching

1016
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:13,578
Just 20 days left
for November 2nd

1017
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:19,915
Though Pavitra doesn't
want it to be ostentatious

1018
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:23,353
We should invite
our close friends

1019
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:38,298
- Hello Merin
- Vijay

1020
01:39:38,405 --> 01:39:41,602
I received a letter from NHS

1021
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:45,702
Because I am physically unfit
they have cancelled my appointment

1022
01:39:45,779 --> 01:39:47,303
It says using their visa...

1023
01:39:47,381 --> 01:39:50,077
...I can stay here
only up to 30th

1024
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:52,015
What should I do, Vijay?

1025
01:39:52,086 --> 01:39:53,280
Merin l...

1026
01:39:53,387 --> 01:39:56,686
Merin, I am Francis
Vijay's friend

1027
01:39:56,757 --> 01:39:58,384
Don't worry

1028
01:39:58,459 --> 01:40:01,519
Today itself
I will contact NHS...

1029
01:40:01,595 --> 01:40:05,156
...and get an appointment
to meet HR Manager

1030
01:40:05,232 --> 01:40:08,224
Let us try to explain
your plight to them

1031
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:10,963
- If they empathise...
- Okay

1032
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:13,529
After getting appointment
I will call you

1033
01:40:13,607 --> 01:40:15,438
- Ok bye
- Merin

1034
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:17,576
Francis brother

1035
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:20,139
Don't stare at me

1036
01:40:20,214 --> 01:40:23,012
I deliberately prevented
you from talking to her

1037
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:26,280
You would again give
false hopes to that girl

1038
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:34,321
Mr.Francis

1039
01:40:34,395 --> 01:40:38,024
At the NHS...we have to follow
certain rules and regulations

1040
01:40:38,098 --> 01:40:41,158
And when we have made
a decision in this particular case...

1041
01:40:41,235 --> 01:40:43,396
...after checking up
this procedural case

1042
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:46,462
I don't think we can
do a recheck over it

1043
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:47,700
Sorry!

1044
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:51,040
Ma'am I mean
on humanitarian grounds...

1045
01:40:51,111 --> 01:40:52,043
If you can...

1046
01:40:52,112 --> 01:40:57,243
See Mr.Francis, the best NHS
can offer is a compensation...

1047
01:40:57,351 --> 01:41:00,479
...and a ticket back to lndia
That's all

1048
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:03,055
That's not all...
How does it work...?

1049
01:41:03,123 --> 01:41:05,023
Merin is here on
your invitation

1050
01:41:05,092 --> 01:41:07,356
So she is your
responsibility

1051
01:41:09,763 --> 01:41:13,255
Ma'am, I really beg you
to help me in this situation

1052
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:15,824
Please consider me
as a care assistant...

1053
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:18,128
...at one of the small nursing homes

1054
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:19,205
Please!

1055
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:22,470
I don't know how I will
get back home this way

1056
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:30,477
Merin...I will pray for
a miracle foryou

1057
01:41:30,584 --> 01:41:32,108
I am so sorry

1058
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:34,449
There is nothing
more that I can do

1059
01:41:34,521 --> 01:41:36,045
I feel so helpless

1060
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:38,182
Dear...don't weep

1061
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:24,329
Merin...!

1062
01:43:06,914 --> 01:43:09,382
Hello, sir
Welcome to Ben Nevis

1063
01:43:09,449 --> 01:43:10,473
Thank you

1064
01:43:10,551 --> 01:43:11,643
This way

1065
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,854
Please take your seat, sir

1066
01:43:47,721 --> 01:43:48,813
Sorry, sir!

1067
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,880
Cell phones are
prohibited in the plant

1068
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:53,426
It may cause
a chemical reaction

1069
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:56,193
- Oh sorry
- That's fine, sir

1070
01:44:19,419 --> 01:44:22,513
- Has Francis brother come?
- He is in upstairs

1071
01:44:38,338 --> 01:44:40,363
Have you come?

1072
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:44,467
How is the distillery gifted to
prospective son-in-law by Nambiar?

1073
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,637
Distillery is stupendous

1074
01:44:46,747 --> 01:44:50,410
In fact it is beyond our dreams

1075
01:44:50,717 --> 01:44:53,982
But it has started
suffocating me

1076
01:44:54,588 --> 01:44:57,250
Without informing me
he gifted this to me

1077
01:44:57,324 --> 01:44:59,815
I get the feeling
it was a gratis to me

1078
01:44:59,926 --> 01:45:01,689
You would feel it, dear

1079
01:45:01,762 --> 01:45:07,632
Because you've started to attend
humanist classes in the evening

1080
01:45:07,734 --> 01:45:11,363
Else many...people would
have seen your other side

1081
01:45:13,507 --> 01:45:14,496
That reminds me

1082
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:16,474
Have you heard
about Merin's case...?

1083
01:45:16,543 --> 01:45:17,441
Gosh...

1084
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:20,344
I switched off the phone
when she called me today morning

1085
01:45:20,414 --> 01:45:22,507
I forgot to switch it on again
Let me call her

1086
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:23,378
Wait

1087
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:24,678
Before you call

1088
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:27,413
We took her to NHS today

1089
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:32,053
Merin may have to go back
to lndia by this month end

1090
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,988
No other alternatives for that

1091
01:45:37,898 --> 01:45:39,889
You need not
worry about that

1092
01:45:39,966 --> 01:45:42,662
Merin is mature
enough to comprehend

1093
01:45:42,769 --> 01:45:46,933
I would make her
understand about your situation

1094
01:45:48,108 --> 01:45:52,511
Then...whatever you have decided
about helping her issue a cheque...

1095
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:55,343
...in her name and
give it to me

1096
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:56,575
I would give it to her

1097
01:45:56,650 --> 01:45:57,844
Giving a cheque to her...?

1098
01:45:57,951 --> 01:45:59,418
Brother...what are you talking?

1099
01:45:59,486 --> 01:46:03,718
If you really want to help her at this
time this is what you should do

1100
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:25,803
- Were you sleeping?
- No

1101
01:46:25,912 --> 01:46:26,776
Come!

1102
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:39,558
I am now coming from NHS...

1103
01:46:40,994 --> 01:46:43,792
...1000 pounds and air ticket

1104
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:48,160
Gratis shown on
compassionate grounds

1105
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:51,763
The ticket is booked for 27th

1106
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:01,748
Don't worry on this score

1107
01:47:01,848 --> 01:47:03,713
We are all with you

1108
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:07,581
Have you seen this?

1109
01:47:07,687 --> 01:47:10,383
Vijay has sent this for you

1110
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:11,985
What is it?

1111
01:47:12,058 --> 01:47:14,652
A gift to you from him

1112
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:17,525
Until such time there is
a solution to all your problems...

1113
01:47:17,597 --> 01:47:20,657
...to lead a comfortable life
foryou and yourfamily

1114
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:22,998
He has given you
an amount in this

1115
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:26,997
Don't think about
anything else

1116
01:47:27,107 --> 01:47:28,540
Take this, dear

1117
01:47:37,684 --> 01:47:42,121
When Vijay was 17
their Kolkata business...

1118
01:47:42,189 --> 01:47:45,488
...crumpled and his
parents committed suicide

1119
01:47:45,559 --> 01:47:49,120
Somehow he managed
to come here

1120
01:47:49,696 --> 01:47:52,426
And presently
he is in this stage

1121
01:47:52,532 --> 01:47:56,024
So no one else here
can understand you better than him

1122
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:58,502
I have understood that, brother

1123
01:47:58,605 --> 01:48:01,665
This cheque testifies that

1124
01:48:01,741 --> 01:48:03,106
Certainly!

1125
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:14,177
Francis brother told me
about your marriage

1126
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:23,159
But I may not be able
to attend your marriage

1127
01:48:23,263 --> 01:48:26,790
For coming 27th they have booked
the ticket for me

1128
01:48:26,867 --> 01:48:28,732
Merin, l...

1129
01:48:29,236 --> 01:48:34,469
Thinking about my plight
you need not get tensed

1130
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:37,543
I will recoup from all these

1131
01:48:37,611 --> 01:48:41,843
I will come back in life
I have that confidence

1132
01:48:43,884 --> 01:48:48,116
But the gift given by you
would be a hindrance for that

1133
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:51,749
I knowyou gave this
so that I would not suffer

1134
01:48:51,825 --> 01:48:54,259
But I don't want this now

1135
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:56,894
Please take this back

1136
01:49:02,135 --> 01:49:03,864
Please Vijay...

1137
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,564
Merin, l...

1138
01:49:10,343 --> 01:49:12,004
I didn't give this for...

1139
01:49:12,078 --> 01:49:14,706
I merely said
now I don't want this

1140
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:16,180
In case I need it in future

1141
01:49:16,249 --> 01:49:17,307
I will ask you

1142
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:21,119
I always have that freedom

1143
01:49:25,926 --> 01:49:29,157
But I wanted to meet
you for another purpose

1144
01:49:29,262 --> 01:49:31,753
You know Vijay
ever since I came here...

1145
01:49:31,865 --> 01:49:35,164
...other than the hospital
and nearby places

1146
01:49:35,235 --> 01:49:37,203
I haven't gone anywhere

1147
01:49:37,304 --> 01:49:38,737
If it is not inconvenient

1148
01:49:38,838 --> 01:49:40,635
Only if it is not inconvenient

1149
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,834
Can you take me
around for a trip?

1150
01:50:08,735 --> 01:50:12,637
"Pristine clouds swing"

1151
01:50:12,706 --> 01:50:17,040
"Glassy encamp
at heaven's brink"

1152
01:50:17,143 --> 01:50:21,375
"Can reach there?"

1153
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:24,982
"Will you come butterfly"

1154
01:50:25,051 --> 01:50:27,110
"To visit the unseen world"

1155
01:50:27,187 --> 01:50:29,314
"To look for celestial flowers"

1156
01:50:29,389 --> 01:50:33,382
"To jaunt in the
chariot of desires"

1157
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:42,796
"To dethaw some pricking grief
did you consume strawflower honey?"

1158
01:50:47,107 --> 01:50:51,601
"Pristine clouds swing"

1159
01:50:51,678 --> 01:50:55,705
"Glassy encamp
at heaven's brink"

1160
01:50:55,782 --> 01:50:59,912
"Can we reach there?"

1161
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:04,354
"Will you come butterfly"

1162
01:51:17,203 --> 01:51:25,838
"At kerb or at coast
let's move together"

1163
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:33,375
"ln each leaf tip
let's fall as foggy droplets"

1164
01:51:33,486 --> 01:51:37,820
"Gleams abound henceforth
In xanthous cities"

1165
01:51:37,891 --> 01:51:42,089
"ln dreamy chariots
in the infinite sky"

1166
01:51:42,162 --> 01:51:46,064
"ln flowery breeze
can we move around"

1167
01:51:46,132 --> 01:51:48,692
"To visit the unseen world"

1168
01:51:48,802 --> 01:51:50,963
"To look for celestial flowers"

1169
01:51:51,037 --> 01:51:55,030
"To jaunt in the
chariot of desires"

1170
01:51:55,141 --> 01:52:03,139
"To dethaw some pricking grief
did you consume strawflower honey?"

1171
01:52:03,249 --> 01:52:05,774
"Shower now"

1172
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:28,068
"While on move I will
lean on your shoulders"

1173
01:52:28,174 --> 01:52:35,740
"Will cuddle to bosom
this land's beauty"

1174
01:52:35,815 --> 01:52:39,808
"ln exquisite note..."

1175
01:52:39,886 --> 01:52:48,419
"...those dreamy verses written by moon
would become the sixth epic"

1176
01:52:48,528 --> 01:52:50,894
"To visit the unseen world"

1177
01:52:50,997 --> 01:52:53,124
"To look for celestial flowers"

1178
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:57,226
"To jaunt in the
chariot of desires"

1179
01:52:57,303 --> 01:53:05,210
"To dethaw some pricking grief
did you consume strawflower honey?"

1180
01:53:05,311 --> 01:53:08,508
"Shower now"

1181
01:53:08,982 --> 01:53:12,975
"Pristine clouds swing"

1182
01:53:13,052 --> 01:53:17,785
"Glassy encamp
at heaven's brink"

1183
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:23,981
Shall I leave, Gracy sister

1184
01:56:03,323 --> 01:56:06,224
Hello...
Ah Sara

1185
01:56:06,459 --> 01:56:10,259
Ya...we have reached

1186
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:12,327
Ya we will come there

1187
01:56:13,299 --> 01:56:14,527
Okay Sara, bye

1188
01:56:17,337 --> 01:56:21,330
Vijay, a friend of mine is
in Kuwait Airways- Sara

1189
01:56:21,441 --> 01:56:24,171
She would help
Merin for checking in

1190
01:56:24,243 --> 01:56:27,178
She would accompany
you up to aircraft

1191
01:56:41,627 --> 01:56:43,595
I would leave her with Sara

1192
01:56:43,696 --> 01:56:44,993
Come, Merin

1193
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:53,095
Shall I leave...?

1194
01:58:35,875 --> 01:58:40,642
Friends colleagues
Ladies and gentlemen

1195
01:58:40,713 --> 01:58:42,305
Thank you all
for coming here

1196
01:58:42,415 --> 01:58:48,376
Some of you might find the motive
behind this occasion a trifle baffling...

1197
01:58:48,488 --> 01:58:50,854
...considering my lovely
daughter Pavitra

1198
01:58:50,923 --> 01:58:53,551
Getting married
in three days time

1199
01:58:53,626 --> 01:58:57,255
So this get together is to formally
introduce my future son in law

1200
01:58:57,363 --> 01:58:59,558
Mr.Vijay Das
to all of you

1201
01:59:00,566 --> 01:59:02,796
Pavitra and Vijay please

1202
01:59:05,638 --> 01:59:06,730
Go

1203
01:59:39,405 --> 01:59:40,895
Vijay is new to us

1204
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:45,543
In fact he is new to our circle
and to this strata of society

1205
01:59:45,645 --> 01:59:47,875
When I talked
about this proposal...

1206
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:49,880
...many of my friends
talked to me as though

1207
01:59:49,982 --> 01:59:54,419
I am going to
commit some big folly

1208
01:59:54,921 --> 01:59:59,915
Me and my daughter were blackmailed
by Vijay to make us accept this

1209
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:03,458
Some people in this group
even thought in those lines

1210
02:00:03,863 --> 02:00:05,455
But I strongly believe

1211
02:00:05,531 --> 02:00:09,831
Vijay is a bright young man
and my daughter and my legacy...

1212
02:00:09,936 --> 02:00:11,961
...are safe in his hands

1213
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:15,772
So I welcome Vijay
to our August group of friends

1214
02:00:15,841 --> 02:00:17,331
Let's celebrate

1215
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:05,422
Hello

1216
02:01:12,765 --> 02:01:14,289
Are you sure?

1217
02:01:16,702 --> 02:01:17,999
What's it Vijay?

1218
02:01:19,338 --> 02:01:20,635
What happened?

1219
02:01:21,474 --> 02:01:22,771
Who called you?

1220
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:25,477
It was Gracy

1221
02:01:25,911 --> 02:01:27,936
- Merin...
- Merin?

1222
02:01:28,514 --> 02:01:31,039
Merin has not yet
reached home

1223
02:01:37,890 --> 02:01:42,554
Are you sure?
Oh that's fine

1224
02:01:42,628 --> 02:01:45,563
Ok...thank you Sara

1225
02:01:45,665 --> 02:01:50,728
I will call you later
It was Sara's call

1226
02:01:50,803 --> 02:01:53,636
Merin has alighted at
Nedumbassery airport

1227
02:01:53,706 --> 02:01:56,038
She has inquired
with airlines

1228
02:01:56,309 --> 02:01:59,506
Anyway with Merin's
passport details

1229
02:01:59,612 --> 02:02:02,809
I have sent a mail to
lndian emigration department

1230
02:02:02,882 --> 02:02:04,850
But you know
about our system

1231
02:02:04,950 --> 02:02:06,542
Perhaps they might reply

1232
02:02:06,652 --> 02:02:08,381
My strong suspicion is...

1233
02:02:08,454 --> 02:02:10,820
...she would have taken
some extreme steps

1234
02:02:10,890 --> 02:02:13,415
Because her plight is so

1235
02:02:17,963 --> 02:02:20,864
No point in this
round table conference

1236
02:02:20,966 --> 02:02:21,955
Must enquire...

1237
02:02:22,068 --> 02:02:24,866
One of us must go
to lndia and enquire

1238
02:02:24,970 --> 02:02:27,302
If required I would go

1239
02:02:28,641 --> 02:02:30,768
Oh that's good

1240
02:02:30,843 --> 02:02:34,438
Then ticket and other expenses
I would meet

1241
02:02:35,014 --> 02:02:38,040
No...no one need to go

1242
02:02:43,456 --> 02:02:48,519
I would go
I must go

1243
02:03:10,516 --> 02:03:12,507
Vijay did you
really mean that...

1244
02:03:12,585 --> 02:03:14,951
...you would go to
enquire about Merin...?

1245
02:03:15,388 --> 02:03:16,446
Yes!

1246
02:03:16,522 --> 02:03:20,424
Then what about our marriage
scheduled after 2 days?

1247
02:03:20,893 --> 02:03:22,884
I don't know Pavitra

1248
02:03:22,995 --> 02:03:25,054
I don't know anything

1249
02:03:25,698 --> 02:03:30,601
I only knowwhat I do now
is a big mistake

1250
02:03:30,669 --> 02:03:37,939
First to Merin and nowto you
I can mend only one of the two mistakes

1251
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:40,638
I am going only for that

1252
02:03:42,148 --> 02:03:43,979
I must go

1253
02:04:01,834 --> 02:04:03,199
May I come in?

1254
02:04:06,105 --> 02:04:07,197
Sure

1255
02:04:19,051 --> 02:04:21,519
I made many
calls to you

1256
02:04:25,991 --> 02:04:27,720
Pavi is very upset

1257
02:04:28,694 --> 02:04:32,755
What we business people think
she may not understand

1258
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:39,494
When things reach a point
where anything can be demanded

1259
02:04:39,905 --> 02:04:41,964
Then utilise it
to the maximum

1260
02:04:42,074 --> 02:04:44,804
That is business
Is it not?

1261
02:04:45,110 --> 02:04:46,134
Sir...I

1262
02:04:46,212 --> 02:04:49,613
Anyway you may have
an idea about my wealth

1263
02:04:49,715 --> 02:04:51,979
So nowyou can ask

1264
02:04:52,284 --> 02:04:54,878
Sir...what I said to Pavitra

1265
02:04:55,654 --> 02:04:57,884
What I said to Pavitra is true

1266
02:04:57,990 --> 02:05:00,891
What...?
Are you such a fool?

1267
02:05:01,227 --> 02:05:02,717
I don't believe it

1268
02:05:06,665 --> 02:05:12,570
Do you believe after insulting me
and my daughter before the entire society?

1269
02:05:12,671 --> 02:05:15,162
You can leave this place?

1270
02:05:20,779 --> 02:05:21,768
Never

1271
02:05:23,082 --> 02:05:25,107
So forget everything else

1272
02:05:25,184 --> 02:05:26,617
Cheer up

1273
02:05:26,685 --> 02:05:28,880
You are getting
married in 2 days

1274
02:05:28,954 --> 02:05:30,046
Okay?

1275
02:05:31,657 --> 02:05:33,591
If it is not so

1276
02:06:31,116 --> 02:06:32,674
Hey stop

1277
02:06:34,887 --> 02:06:36,548
What damn are you doing?

1278
02:06:36,622 --> 02:06:38,021
Are you blind?

1279
02:06:43,262 --> 02:06:45,822
Come and get
in to the car

1280
02:06:53,072 --> 02:06:56,303
Nambiar sir wants
to meet you urgently

1281
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:59,077
I have to...

1282
02:06:59,244 --> 02:07:01,804
I have to go
to lndia urgently

1283
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:03,643
I would meet him on
my return, tell sir

1284
02:07:03,749 --> 02:07:04,977
How can you
talk like that?

1285
02:07:05,050 --> 02:07:07,109
Nambiar sir asked us
to bring you to him

1286
02:07:07,186 --> 02:07:08,983
Come on... Iet's go

1287
02:07:09,088 --> 02:07:11,750
Clear your hands off me

1288
02:07:16,929 --> 02:07:18,226
Leave me

1289
02:07:30,309 --> 02:07:31,936
Stop it

1290
02:07:33,646 --> 02:07:35,614
What's going on here?

1291
02:07:36,315 --> 02:07:37,873
Leave him

1292
02:07:37,950 --> 02:07:40,783
I said leave him

1293
02:07:45,924 --> 02:07:47,653
Who instructed you?

1294
02:07:47,826 --> 02:07:49,418
I asked who instructed you?

1295
02:07:49,662 --> 02:07:51,892
Nambiar sir asked us
to bring him

1296
02:07:51,964 --> 02:07:53,625
Did daddy say?

1297
02:07:53,699 --> 02:07:57,328
Did daddy ask you to
tussle in middle of the road?

1298
02:08:00,339 --> 02:08:01,897
Nonsense

1299
02:08:03,275 --> 02:08:04,902
Vijay, one minute

1300
02:08:27,433 --> 02:08:30,960
Vijay you may go
No one would prevent you

1301
02:08:31,036 --> 02:08:33,800
But before that
you must meet daddy once

1302
02:08:33,872 --> 02:08:34,998
Please...

1303
02:08:36,508 --> 02:08:40,877
Else what you do
can never be justified

1304
02:08:40,979 --> 02:08:43,413
It would become
a covert fleeing

1305
02:08:43,482 --> 02:08:44,779
Please...

1306
02:10:03,262 --> 02:10:04,422
Sir

1307
02:10:15,507 --> 02:10:17,372
You are not as
I thought you to be

1308
02:10:17,442 --> 02:10:20,377
Your emotional
intelligence is very poor

1309
02:10:20,445 --> 02:10:23,243
That's ok
It will change

1310
02:10:33,125 --> 02:10:36,322
This is an agreement
for transferring 30%...

1311
02:10:36,395 --> 02:10:40,923
...of my share in my entire
wealth including the distillery

1312
02:10:40,999 --> 02:10:47,029
This one is to cancel the existing lease
agreement with you and Ben Nevis

1313
02:10:48,841 --> 02:10:51,935
You can sign
either of them

1314
02:11:05,457 --> 02:11:10,622
Perhaps this may be the most
crucial signature of your life

1315
02:11:10,896 --> 02:11:13,091
So do the right thing

1316
02:12:29,441 --> 02:12:31,636
I can do only this sir

1317
02:12:33,578 --> 02:12:35,512
The mistake is mine

1318
02:12:36,014 --> 02:12:37,481
Mine only

1319
02:12:40,218 --> 02:12:43,051
My mind is now
very far away...

1320
02:12:43,989 --> 02:12:48,551
...from what you have
offered me now

1321
02:12:56,335 --> 02:13:00,032
I realised it very late

1322
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:05,970
But if I still lie to myself

1323
02:13:07,412 --> 02:13:11,576
It would be my biggest
to you and Pavitra betrayal

1324
02:13:14,052 --> 02:13:17,044
I want nothing sir
Nothing

1325
02:13:20,192 --> 02:13:22,285
Allow me to go

1326
02:13:23,128 --> 02:13:24,186
Please...

1327
02:13:51,556 --> 02:13:54,684
I shouldn't have looked for
a guy who could carry on my business

1328
02:13:54,760 --> 02:14:01,393
I should have looked for a guy
who would love my daughter

1329
02:14:01,600 --> 02:14:04,433
Anyway it was my fault

1330
02:14:04,603 --> 02:14:05,535
Sir l...

1331
02:14:05,604 --> 02:14:07,094
You need not
wait any longer

1332
02:14:07,172 --> 02:14:09,299
Go...
Just go

1333
02:14:11,476 --> 02:14:12,465
Then

1334
02:14:13,078 --> 02:14:18,038
First time a guy is walking out
in front of me smartly

1335
02:14:18,116 --> 02:14:22,815
So thank my daughter
at least in your mind

1336
02:14:23,188 --> 02:14:25,179
Poor girl

1337
02:14:25,424 --> 02:14:28,018
She did her best
to convince me

1338
02:15:02,627 --> 02:15:03,787
Let's go

1339
02:15:04,362 --> 02:15:07,058
If we delay any further
you may miss the flight

1340
02:15:57,182 --> 02:15:59,878
So ok Vijay
Wish you all the best

1341
02:15:59,951 --> 02:16:01,179
On reaching lndia...

1342
02:16:01,286 --> 02:16:03,846
May you find Merin
as quickly as possible

1343
02:16:06,158 --> 02:16:07,557
Thank you Pavitra

1344
02:16:07,626 --> 02:16:08,923
Good luck

1345
02:16:39,758 --> 02:16:41,419
Hello Francis brother...

1346
02:16:41,493 --> 02:16:42,926
No I have just reached

1347
02:16:42,994 --> 02:16:44,552
Howwas the journey?

1348
02:16:44,629 --> 02:16:45,755
Not bad

1349
02:16:45,864 --> 02:16:48,731
- Did Pavitra call you?
- No

1350
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:50,162
What is it?

1351
02:16:50,235 --> 02:16:52,226
She called me
some time ago

1352
02:16:52,337 --> 02:16:54,532
She said if I could
reach you to inform you...

1353
02:16:54,606 --> 02:16:57,200
...to reach Merin's house
as soon as possible

1354
02:16:57,309 --> 02:16:58,776
What happened brother?

1355
02:16:58,877 --> 02:17:00,242
Any idea about what it is?

1356
02:17:00,312 --> 02:17:02,337
No, she didn't say anything

1357
02:17:02,647 --> 02:17:05,275
But she was very tensed

1358
02:18:26,398 --> 02:18:29,561
Lousy job in this rain

1359
02:18:29,934 --> 02:18:32,368
These utensils...

1360
02:18:45,784 --> 02:18:47,547
Bring it man

1361
02:18:47,619 --> 02:18:49,450
Clean and keep it here

1362
02:18:49,554 --> 02:18:53,786
Why do you bring
these broken things?

1363
02:18:58,430 --> 02:19:01,399
Bring it man
Keep it there

1364
02:19:01,499 --> 02:19:05,367
Bring that
Bring that here

1365
02:19:05,470 --> 02:19:06,767
Don't break it

1366
02:19:06,871 --> 02:19:08,099
Bring it here

1367
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:10,433
They will have
only these things

1368
02:19:10,508 --> 02:19:13,033
When did the
London sir come...?

1369
02:19:13,144 --> 02:19:19,913
Finally they have made me earn the bad
name that I have pushed them to streets

1370
02:19:20,018 --> 02:19:23,852
What to do?
There is no other go

1371
02:19:30,061 --> 02:19:30,857
Merin...?

1372
02:19:30,929 --> 02:19:33,090
That reminds me...

1373
02:19:33,164 --> 02:19:38,067
If some people are extended help
beyond a limit even God doesn't like it

1374
02:19:38,136 --> 02:19:42,539
Else howwill the girl
who went to London...

1375
02:19:42,607 --> 02:19:45,974
...to earn a fortune
return losing her hand?

1376
02:19:46,411 --> 02:19:49,903
It is all one's destiny

1377
02:19:50,014 --> 02:19:52,414
Do it carefully man

1378
02:19:52,484 --> 02:19:54,975
Don't annoy me unnecessarily

1379
02:20:32,590 --> 02:20:33,887
Sister

1380
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:37,393
Sister

1381
02:20:38,963 --> 02:20:40,590
It is for you

1382
02:20:49,541 --> 02:20:50,599
Hello?

1383
02:20:54,045 --> 02:20:55,478
Merin

1384
02:21:15,467 --> 02:21:16,866
It is Pavitra

1385
02:21:17,235 --> 02:21:19,430
She wants to talk to you

1386
02:21:25,677 --> 02:21:27,542
- Hello
- Vijay

1387
02:21:27,645 --> 02:21:30,045
Did what I said happen?

1388
02:21:34,652 --> 02:21:38,645
As soon as you reached lndia
you could soon find Merin

1389
02:21:38,723 --> 02:21:39,849
Pavitra

1390
02:21:39,924 --> 02:21:43,690
Only when we
lose something for ever...

1391
02:21:44,062 --> 02:21:46,997
...we realise it was
so precious to us

1392
02:21:51,636 --> 02:21:56,232
With 10000 pounds
you wanted to settle your love

1393
02:21:56,508 --> 02:21:58,533
But for that wisdom
to dawn on you...

1394
02:21:58,610 --> 02:22:00,942
...before me you had to

1395
02:22:01,045 --> 02:22:02,239
Sorry

1396
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:04,580
Now not only you

1397
02:22:04,682 --> 02:22:06,741
All of us understand

1398
02:22:06,818 --> 02:22:11,118
Your love for
Merin was genuine

1399
02:22:13,191 --> 02:22:16,217
Any way when you
return to London

1400
02:22:16,294 --> 02:22:19,991
I will look forward to
meet Mr and Mrs Vijay Das

1401
02:22:20,098 --> 02:22:21,531
Bye Vijay

1402
02:23:04,742 --> 02:23:05,936
Sorry

1403
02:23:10,615 --> 02:23:12,276
I am late

1404
02:23:14,586 --> 02:23:16,076
Very much

1405
02:23:40,411 --> 02:23:43,346
'My thoughts were only about me
It has changed'

1406
02:23:43,414 --> 02:23:47,612
'From now on I have
started living for others too'

1407
02:23:47,719 --> 02:23:49,880
'ln the language of
Francis brother...'

1408
02:23:49,954 --> 02:23:52,980
'...I went to learn
humanism in evening class'

1409
02:23:53,057 --> 02:23:55,116
'l have passed in first class'

1410
02:23:55,426 --> 02:23:57,053
'l just realised'

1411
02:23:57,128 --> 02:24:02,361
'This is the most important
day of my life'

1412
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:05,660
'The most important day'
