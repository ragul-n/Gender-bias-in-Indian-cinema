1
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,396
Did you ask for me?
- Yes.

2
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,934
What's the matter?
- What do I tell you?

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,334
Nothing worse could happen.
Our ancestral memento has been stolen

4
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,204
You mean, that dragon?
- Yes.

5
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,544
But, how?
- Ask, who stole it?

6
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,606
Who?
- Your brother!

7
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,539
Madan!
- Yes, Madan stole it.

8
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,946
If I knew that l'd
have to see this day...

9
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,947
...then I would have
killed him when he was born!

10
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,950
But what do I do now?
- I'll go.

11
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,123
You don't know his whereabouts.

12
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:07,231
I'll complain to the police.
- No.

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,964
Everyone will know
that my son is a thief.

14
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,565
I won't be able to face anyone.
- What do I do?

15
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,976
Find him somehow and bring him here.

16
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:20,513
How?

17
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,521
Greetings, Mr. Madan.

18
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,725
Didn't you recognise me?

19
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,791
I used to work at your
place in Rangoon. I'm Shamu.

20
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,127
Yes, I remember.
What are you doing here?

21
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:00,136
With God's grace and yours,
I ride a carriage.

22
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,473
That's good.

23
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,733
When did you come?
- This morning. I have some work.

24
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,878
How's your wife and Mr. Prem?
- Fine.

25
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,407
May I drop you somewhere?

26
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,746
I'll take time.
- I'll wait for you.

27
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,156
I have a lot of work.
You go ahead.

28
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,689
Is the carriage empty?
- Yes.

29
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,166
How much will you charge
to take me to Sham Bazaar?

30
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,932
Twenty rupees...
I mean, two rupees.

31
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:41,174
I can get any price I quote
for this, in the market.

32
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:46,507
Your family's honour will be at
stake if you do so in the open.

33
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,778
That's the problem.

34
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:53,625
Once upon a time, this dragon was
the pride of the Chinese Kings.

35
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,958
Then, it went to King Shung of
Burma and finally to my ancestors.

36
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,793
You know everything.

37
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:09,402
But circumstances
compel me to sell it.

38
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,807
You are quoting a very low price.

39
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:18,206
One can quote a price
only if it has good returns.

40
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:23,552
Like you, even I cannot
sell it in the open market.

41
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,781
Right?
- Yes.

42
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,490
Come here at 1 1 a.m. tomorrow.

43
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,629
I'll get the cash from the bank.

44
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,564
Let's both think it over.

45
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,601
I'll pay you a few thousands more.

46
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,301
I'll come here at 1 1 a.m. sharp.
- Okay.

47
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,279
Who's it?...
It's me. Call Mr. Pyarelal.

48
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:34,953
The dragon is genuine. It's worth
at least 500 thousand rupees.

49
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,696
I like it very much.

50
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,976
Come with me.

51
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,661
The man over there wants a taxi.

52
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,403
Glory to Lord Shiva!

53
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,406
Where are you running?

54
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:44,753
Where are you going?
You have left your man behind.

55
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,887
Why do you consume alcohol
if you can't handle it?

56
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:53,754
Excuse me...get up.
Your men have gone away.

57
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,964
He is dead! It's a ghost!

58
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,969
Uncle Shamu!

59
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:12,715
Why are you screaming at this hour
of the night? He is not here.

60
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,112
Someone was murdered.
- Who?

61
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,979
I don't know. But I witnessed it.

62
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,051
Three men removed a
dead man from the car...

63
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,230
...threw him from
Howrah bridge and escaped.

64
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:31,127
What were you doing there?
- I was relaxing with my opium.

65
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,135
You are high and
are talking rubbish!

66
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:38,876
I came back to my senses
when I saw this. Secondly...

67
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,975
Enough! Go and sleep now.

68
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,479
If someone hears you,
you will be behind bars!

69
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,078
Why?

70
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,085
For talking gibberish in this state!

71
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,814
But..
- Go.

72
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,926
Strange!

73
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,822
Some men threw a dead man,
and I've to keep my mouth shut!

74
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,222
Where did you find it?
- Here. Your wallet is heavy.

75
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,056
Are you making an official tour?
- Yes. To Calcutta.

76
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,231
Here's my card.

77
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:11,069
I own a big hotel there. My dancer,
Edna, will keep you entertained.

78
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,231
She'll be performing now.
- I'm not interested.

79
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,287
Waiting for your girlfriend?

80
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,594
Are you counting the
waves in the ocean?

81
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,169
Your name is 'Prem' (love)...

82
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,051
Alright, go ahead.
I'll change and come.

83
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,483
Your dance was incredible!

84
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,898
I'm Edna's uncle, Joe.

85
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,568
I'm glad, you liked her dance.

86
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,506
You really are incredible!

87
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,911
If my dance was so good, then
your friend wouldn't walk away.

88
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,581
Did you like her dance?

89
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,657
We've already met.

90
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,090
This is my niece, Edna.

91
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,593
She is shy.

92
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,080
See you.

93
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,991
Greetings, Mr. Prem.
- You?

94
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,328
How's everybody at home?
- Fine.

95
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,134
Keep the luggage.

96
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,679
I am sorry to hear
about your elder brother.

97
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,515
How did you know?
- I'll tell you. Please sit.

98
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:01,031
When did you meet Madan?
- The evening he was murdered.

99
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,636
I was then called
to the police station.

100
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,477
I identified the body.
- Why were you called?

101
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,204
If a tourist is harmed...

102
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:15,044
...then the cops call all the
drivers for the investigations.

103
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,056
Where did you meet Madan?
- Near a hotel.

104
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,652
Take me there.

105
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,486
Alright, but it's a dangerous place.

106
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,393
I had asked Mr. Madan
not to go but he refused.

107
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,656
I want to go there, for they
may have a hand in the murder.

108
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,069
May be.
- Take me there.

109
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,262
Give a false name and address.

110
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:05,536
Pretend as though we are strangers.

111
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,543
Here comes your hotel.
- Remove the baggage.

112
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,714
Remove the baggage.

113
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,367
He wants a good room.
- Where are you from?

114
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,800
He is a foreigner.
- Where are you from?

115
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,803
Your name?

116
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,840
How long will you stay here?

117
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,715
...please sign here.

118
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,584
Have a bath and relax.

119
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,863
I'll come in the
evening to take you out.

120
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,497
Keep his luggage in Room. No. 1 0.

121
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:20,772
My commission?

122
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,183
I can't understand English.

123
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,178
So, you've come?

124
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,111
Chang is waiting for you.

125
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,792
Have you got some customer, Shamu?

126
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,896
No. I forgot to take money from
the customer I had got earlier.

127
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,127
You?
- Yes, Sir.

128
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,068
How much do I pay?
- Five rupees and nine annas.

129
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,874
That girl has followed me
from Rangoon. Do you know her?

130
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,212
Yes.
- What does she do?

131
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:26,815
She owns a hotel near the shore
and sells drugs, like Chang.

132
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:32,482
Get me a room in that hotel.
- I'll try.

133
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,222
Rs.5 and 9 annas, right?
- Yes.

134
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,289
Look, who's here.

135
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,502
How are you? Please sit.

136
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,000
Edna, you have come
here after a long time.

137
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,308
This place hasn't changed at all.

138
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,909
But you have drastically changed.

139
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,087
You look so beautiful and lovely.

140
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,653
Let's talk about business first.

141
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,194
Alright.

142
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:14,454
What do you wish to talk about?

143
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,701
Joe says that we'll get the
stock of narcotics tomorrow night.

144
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,799
Get the stock tomorrow.

145
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:26,866
When I got your call, I knew that
you were successful in your mission.

146
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,042
Edna deserves to be lauded, not me.

147
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,210
There was a lot of danger involved.

148
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,554
Don't talk nonsense!
Edna has nothing to worry about.

149
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,890
One look at Edna and the
person will be hypnotised!

150
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,166
I have a small request to make.
- Yes?

151
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,900
It's Christmas tomorrow.
I want to buy Edna, a gift.

152
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,134
I've just returned
from Hong Kong and Rangoon.

153
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,833
I'm broke. So please
arrange for some money.

154
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,582
Don't worry. I will
handle all the expenses.

155
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,585
I'll give Edna, a gift, too.

156
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,183
I'll send some cash
with Pyarelal tomorrow.

157
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,256
Will that be fine?...
Edna, is that okay?

158
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,320
Let's go, uncle.
- Have a soft drink.

159
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,691
No. I'm very tired.

160
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,606
Pyarelal, please wait here.

161
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,976
I'll see you later.

162
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,965
Alright, take Rs.1 0.
- Thank you.

163
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,075
Greetings, madam.
- Greetings. How are you?

164
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,151
I'm fine. How are you?

165
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,146
Do you know the man,
you were with just now?

166
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:21,990
No. He's a new customer.

167
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,995
I too have a hotel.
I can get him a room.

168
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,823
I can't say...

169
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,197
I get the point, madam.

170
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,145
Why did you give Shamu Rs.1 0?
- I gave him a tip.

171
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:47,151
I am marketing for our hotel.

172
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:50,017
You are already learning
the tricks of the trade.

173
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,693
The carriage is ready.
- What happened?

174
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,360
The plan boomeranged.
- Meaning?

175
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,221
She wants you to stay in her hotel.

176
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,098
What!

177
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:13,871
Stop...Sir, here's your hotel.

178
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,049
Come in.

179
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,215
Joe, I have you got a customer

180
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,726
Have you put up here?
- It's my hotel.

181
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,061
I'm glad, we've met again.

182
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:34,226
Do you know each other?
- Yes, we are friends.

183
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,461
We were in the same
ship from Rangoon.

184
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:41,398
I got a customer for him.
But now, I won't get my commission.

185
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,263
Don't worry.

186
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,542
I'll give you a double commission
for getting a rich man like him.

187
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,146
It's good, you came today.
It's our festival night.

188
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,753
My friend here is a rich man.
Give him the best room.

189
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,418
All the rooms are occupied.

190
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,420
Why are you messing things up?
I won't get my commission.

191
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,422
Don't worry.

192
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,566
Take Sir's baggage.
I'll give him my personal room.

193
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,783
I'm glad, a rich man like you
has come to stay in my hotel.

194
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,592
You'll be happy with our service.

195
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,606
Cool breeze.

196
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,613
Wasn't there a murder at
Howrah bridge some days back?

197
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,614
You may relax now.

198
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,381
Do you want some drinks?

199
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,414
Send me a cup of tea.

200
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,353
I'll take this.
- No.

201
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:51,861
I'll get a good tip.
- I'll tip you.

202
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,600
You have my word.
Now give it to me.

203
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,893
Prepare it.

204
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,356
You?

205
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,666
No.

206
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,798
But you are speaking in Hindi.

207
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,734
You're not bad.
Speak to me in Hindi.

208
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,934
I feel shy.

209
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,271
You will initially,
but not after you learn it.

210
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,745
Is that so?

211
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,351
Will you teach me Hindi?

212
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:17,755
Certainly.

213
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:23,688
You are beautiful, you dance well...
I'll get a chance to be with you.

214
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:28,295
What are you saying?
- Did I say something wrong?

215
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:34,770
But you didn't even
look at me on the ship.

216
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,975
I had some worries then.

217
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,979
Help can I do in any way?

218
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,644
You should say, can I help you
in any way?

219
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,646
I've been chattering and
your tea has become cold.

220
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:50,979
No problem.

221
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm sorry for intruding.

222
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,003
I've been waiting
for you since long.

223
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,333
I am Pyarelal.
I am Edna's friend.

224
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,677
Glad to meet you.

225
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,411
Isn't your name, Rakesh?
- How did you know?

226
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,617
Edna's uncle, Joe,
was all praises for you.

227
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,585
I am Rakesh. This lighter
belongs to my friend.

228
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,462
I see!

229
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,030
We'll meet later.

230
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,061
I don't like this.
- What?

231
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,861
Why did you insult him?
Why did you have his tea?

232
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,067
I have a right over you.
- But it was not my tea.

233
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,801
But you must have prepared
it with your delicate hands.

234
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,869
Leave my hand!

235
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,076
What will he think
about your behaviour?

236
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,945
So now, you are more worried
about that fool, than me?

237
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,880
How often should l...

238
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:35,850
I was wondering, where you were.
- Where will I go without Edna?

239
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,097
Why are you not yet
dressed for the dance?

240
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,765
I won't dance today.
- Why?

241
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,830
She is angry with me.

242
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,302
It's no use getting angry.
Get dressed.

243
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,606
It's our festival night.

244
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,108
The tables are
booked because of you.

245
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,115
Our new customer, Rakesh...

246
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,047
...will be in raptures,
seeing your dance.

247
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:07,122
Did you call him for my dance?
- Yes.

248
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,128
Then, I'll certainly dance.
I'll be ready in a minute.

249
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,736
Keep an eye on Edna.
- Meaning?

250
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:28,737
If she keeps giving her
heart to every customer...

251
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,876
...then how long
will your hotel run?

252
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,811
What are you saying?

253
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,747
I know Edna.
She will never leave me.

254
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,821
Are the decorations done?

255
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:17,029
Did you gather any information?
- I met the girl just yesterday.

256
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,029
This girl is your only
source of information.

257
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,100
I'm trying my best.
- lndeed!

258
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:27,239
You are just relaxing here.
- What should I do?

259
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,241
The girl is downstairs.
Go and extract information.

260
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,459
How are you?
- Fine.

261
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,861
What are you doing?
- Admiring the beauty.

262
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,654
From a distance? Come down.
- Alright, I'll just wear my coat.

263
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,803
Are you going to sit here?
- Yes, I'll wait for you.

264
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,000
Be quick.

265
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,571
What are you doing?

266
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,473
I was talking to him...
Are you through?

267
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,146
Whose boat is it?
- It's my boss, Uncle Joe's boat.

268
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,953
It's mine.

269
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,586
I feel like going for a ride..
- No, I have some work.

270
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,992
Sir will be angry.
- Tell him that I took it.

271
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,663
But I have some work.
- I'll return soon.

272
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,525
Did you like Calcutta?

273
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:51,860
It's a nice city, but is big and...

274
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,531
...it's strange.
- Strange?

275
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,967
By strange, I mean,
it's mysterious like you.

276
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,537
Am l?

277
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:05,542
The difference being, that the
city may disappoint me but not you.

278
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:07,978
How?

279
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,948
Will you stand by me even
if the city lets me down?

280
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,895
Look! It's the Howrah bridge!

281
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,900
Hundreds of thousands of people
travel to and fro everyday.

282
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,271
What are you looking at?

283
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,012
These flowing tresses...

284
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,412
...the reflection of
twilight on your face...

285
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,619
What do I tell them?

286
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:27,616
One never knows, whom
we are destined to meet.

287
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,426
We were at different
places, then we met...

288
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:34,623
...we fought a little
and then became friends.

289
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:39,158
Do you consider me, your friend?
- My heart says so.

290
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,631
And your head?

291
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,633
My head won't agree with my heart.
- Why?

292
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,644
My head will always ask
me to be on an alert...

293
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,208
...that Edna has many friends and...

294
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:54,207
I have no friends.
- No? But I know of one.

295
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,385
Who?

296
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,656
He is a bad man...a crook.

297
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,125
He's always trying to
impress me with his wealth.

298
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:08,189
He says that he will give me money,
the best saris, jewellery...Rascal!

299
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:09,466
What jewellery?

300
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,929
His friend...

301
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:18,334
What jewellery? Is it some crown...

302
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,677
I don't know. I want
nothing to do with him.

303
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:26,008
You will be rolling in
luxury if you marry him.

304
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,116
If you talk this way again,
we'll have another fight!

305
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,690
I'll never marry for money.

306
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:37,060
I want a good man...

307
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,182
You are a rascal.

308
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,747
Why did you keep the boat there?
What about the goods now?

309
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,680
The ship will leave tomorrow.
I've already paid the Captain.

310
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:02,948
I'm doomed. You have ruined me!
- I didn't know, she'd take the boat.

311
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,423
Don't act too smart.

312
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:11,532
Edna wouldn't take the
boat without your permission.

313
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,632
You really think, I'm a fool?
- I am innocent.

314
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,372
You are not. Deliver the
goods tomorrow morning.

315
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,643
Why didn't you lock it?
- It used to never be locked.

316
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:31,146
Do so, from tomorrow.
- Why worry? She'll be back soon.

317
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:34,152
Indeed! How do you know?

318
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,394
Sir, the boat has arrived.

319
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,014
Where have you been?

320
00:51:58,448 --> 00:52:02,350
I had gone out with Mr. Rakesh.

321
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,449
That's nice! Who is going to
pay for the losses incurred?

322
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:08,617
Don't interfere!

323
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:13,760
We earn our profits when
customers come to see your dance.

324
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:19,026
There are many hotels in Calcutta.
But why do people come here?

325
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:22,703
You mean, because of her?
- Yes.

326
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,769
How much loss did you incur?
- Around Rs.400.

327
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,839
I'll pay you.

328
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,048
What are you doing?

329
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,709
Return his money.
- Return it?

330
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,055
Be careful. You are
not a child anymore.

331
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,617
You won't return his money?
- No!

332
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,239
Food for you, Sir.

333
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,077
Madam Edna has sent you this letter.

334
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,365
Why did you return the money?

335
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:32,537
I didn't like uncle
borrowing money from you.

336
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:34,909
I apologise.

337
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:38,312
But I gave your uncle
the money, not you.

338
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:44,317
You don't understand.
Uncle always does this.

339
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:48,647
He makes money from
this hotel, from my dance...

340
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,127
I always dance to his tunes.

341
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:54,861
But I can't talk my heart out.

342
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,929
What's it?

343
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,137
I came with you...

344
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,142
You don't know...

345
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:11,544
I wouldn't have been in this
plight, had my parents been alive.

346
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,551
But what is your problem?

347
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:23,148
He's bad and so are his friends.
He indulges in underground dealings.

348
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,558
He's very bad.

349
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,159
Underground?

350
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,829
I mean...

351
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:40,569
Everyone I meet is selfish.

352
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,179
You think of me also
to be like the others?

353
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,911
You are different from the others.

354
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:51,178
You are nice.

355
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:55,581
How do you know that?
- My heart says so.

356
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:45,708
This bridge always reminds
me of the crossroads I am at.

357
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:49,245
Don't worry. The police
are investigating the case.

358
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:54,242
The Calcutta police are a smart lot.
Even the dacoits fear them.

359
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,849
But if I don't find the dragon
even after the culprits are caught...

360
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,056
...then my efforts will be in vain.

361
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,757
You're right.

362
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,055
I have an idea.
- What?

363
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,592
Take me to a jeweller.
- Why?

364
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,860
Do you know of any?

365
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:12,996
I know all of Calcutta.
We'll go to Bada Bazaar.

366
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,275
How are you?
- Fine.

367
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,475
Where have you been?
- I've been busy.

368
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,945
He wants to get something made.
- What?

369
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,682
Something special.
- I'll take you to the Manager.

370
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,679
Please attend to him.
- Yes.

371
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,454
I want to make a replica of this.

372
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:43,290
What is it for?
- For a play...the jewels...

373
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:48,694
The jewels should be
fake but appear genuine.

374
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,040
I'll do that.
When do you want it?

375
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,105
Tomorrow.
- So soon?

376
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,107
How it can be so soon!

377
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,473
The play will be staged tomorrow.
I'll pay you extra.

378
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:02,309
It will cost you Rs.500.
- What!

379
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,651
No problem...Pay him
Rs.1 00 in advance.

380
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,324
Make it a replica of this.

381
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:12,855
When will you deliver it?
- Tomorrow.

382
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,667
My commission?

383
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,677
He is a rich Arab merchant.

384
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:37,117
He wishes to discuss
business with your boss.

385
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:39,355
I'll just speak to him.

386
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,728
A rich Arab merchant
wants to speak to you.

387
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,699
Take him to the boss.

388
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,171
Pardon?

389
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,374
He means, after you.
- Please come.

390
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,977
You are definitely
going to make me broke!

391
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,049
I'm only asking for a commission.

392
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,390
I've got you a customer.

393
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,397
This famous Arab
merchant's name is...

394
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,140
I've heard...

395
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:40,939
Respectable?
We are both respectable.

396
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:44,842
No, I mean,
I have heard about you.

397
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,083
Where did you hear about me?

398
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,855
Who told you about me?

399
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:55,158
Your secretary is beautiful, but...

400
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:11,173
Who told you about me?
- A merchant from Rangoon...

401
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,244
who works for the underworld...

402
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,747
Underworld?
- The ones who evade the police.

403
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:20,581
I don't indulge in
any underground work.

404
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,792
I understand.
My work is also legal.

405
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:30,126
I went to Rangoon from
Hong Kong to get what I want.

406
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,128
I've got something for you.
- What?

407
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:38,467
It's nothing extraordinary.
- I have a flourishing business.

408
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:42,901
I'm not interested
in ordinary things.

409
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:46,812
I'm in dire straits,
so I've come to you.

410
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:52,149
I don't want to waste my time.

411
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,922
...and you don't waste yours either.

412
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,493
At least, take a look at it.

413
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:04,160
Where did you get it from?
- You even know it's name.

414
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:07,230
You must have definitely seen it.

415
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,505
...but a fake one.
- Fake?

416
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:12,502
This is genuine. Mr. Madan,
from Rangoon, who had come...

417
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,070
...with the fake one, was murdered.

418
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:18,378
I don't know a thing about it.

419
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,842
Alright, I'll leave.

420
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,188
Please sit for a while.

421
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,684
Do you like it?
- Yes.

422
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,528
How much will it cost?

423
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,930
Seven hundred thousand.
- Seven hundred thousand!

424
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:38,795
Is it too high?
- Not at all.

425
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,970
Sit here. I'll be back soon.
Don't leave.

426
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,542
I'll get the money.

427
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:24,580
You know the Arab who was here?
- Who?

428
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:28,576
The man, whom Shamu got.
He's a dangerous man.

429
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:32,250
He knows my secret.
He's just escaped from my room.

430
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:34,249
Follow him!

431
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:38,923
Catch him and deal
with him properly.

432
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:54,943
Did Shamu bring any Arab?
- Yes, he's just left.

433
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,950
I am sorry, but I have a customer.

434
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,996
I know that they have the dragon.

435
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,962
But they are suspicious.
Let's go from here quickly.

436
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,976
Who's here?
- A horse.

437
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:36,311
Who's inside?
- A customer.

438
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,449
Why are you lying?

439
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,986
Let me check.
- Allow me.

440
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:46,459
You've known me for so long.
You should trust me.

441
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,663
Let me see the carriage first.

442
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:53,469
Madam...

443
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:56,069
...this is the hotel
owner, Mr. Pyarelal.

444
01:02:56,372 --> 01:03:01,867
He wants to see you. If you
don't mind, then may I lift this?

445
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,478
Shameless!

446
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,848
Ask him to go home and look
at his mother and sisters.

447
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,343
He wants to see me indeed!

448
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,347
I'll tell my husband about it.

449
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:16,692
Come quickly. I'll
complain to the police.

450
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:22,130
I'll take you right now...
Are you satisfied?

451
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:28,029
He will come with you.
- He will?

452
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:34,699
Yes, he will...Please sit behind.

453
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:45,384
There is no need for the 'mister'
or the 'lal'. Just call me Pyare.

454
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,624
I wouldn't dare make that mistake!

455
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:53,958
Just try it once.
- You think, I am foolish?

456
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:57,964
You know very well,
what I think of you.

457
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,967
I don't know.
- You do.

458
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,972
But you pretend not to,
because of Rakesh.

459
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:10,645
You would've behaved differently
with me, if it weren't for him.

460
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,421
Nobody has the right to
interfere in my personal life.

461
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:18,482
I do, as I have a right over you.

462
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:22,486
Very soon, I shall pay
your uncle, your price...

463
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,096
...and make you mine.

464
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:32,339
I don't listen to
such irrelevant talks!

465
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:37,576
I always get what I want.

466
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:10,273
Why didn't you come again?
- You had asked me not to...

467
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,774
You listened to what I said,
but not to what my heart said.

468
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,817
What was in your heart?

469
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:25,390
When will you understand...
and how?

470
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:28,290
What is it?

471
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,796
You want to hear it from me...

472
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:34,069
I'll tell you.

473
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:40,871
I can't believe...

474
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:46,673
Believe me, I love you
with all my heart.

475
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:49,846
Trust me.
- But...

476
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:54,479
You...don't you trust me?

477
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,087
I do. I wanted to ask...

478
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,594
Will you marry me?

479
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:10,105
But I don't like this
hotel and you dancing...

480
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,566
I'll leave everything for you.
I'll do as you please.

481
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,707
When will you take me away?

482
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:20,575
I've nearly accomplished my mission.
Wait for a little while.

483
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:22,018
At least, you be considerate to me.

484
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:26,019
I won't ask for the skies.
All I want is Rs.50 odd rupees.

485
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,363
I don't want to be in a debt.

486
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,159
The news for today...

487
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,860
The government has kept a reward
of Rs.1 0,000 for the murderer.

488
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:39,033
What's the reward for?

489
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:42,377
Reward of Rs.1 0,000 for the murderer
of the Howrah bridge incident.

490
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:44,736
A reward of Rs.1 0,000?

491
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,041
Give me the money.

492
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:51,045
Where is the news printed?
- Here.

493
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:05,400
Blind man! You have such big eyes
and yet can't you see where you go?

494
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,397
Don't be angry. Listen to me...

495
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:12,866
No. I'll break your
head for breaking my pot!

496
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:15,842
Listen...

497
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:19,414
If you break my head,
then who will marry you?

498
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:22,078
Who will buy you
jewellery and clothes?

499
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:27,080
I've incurred a huge loss because
of you and now you give big talks!

500
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:33,019
You will understand only when
I get the reward of Rs.1 0,000.

501
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,929
I'll become Mr. Bhikharilal.

502
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:40,097
You've had it early in the morning?
- What?

503
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:41,436
Opium.

504
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:46,763
Watch how I get you
back to your senses!

505
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,103
Uncle.

506
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:53,039
What is all this noise
about so early in the morning?

507
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:56,451
You've spoilt him!
He's stoned all day long.

508
01:15:56,919 --> 01:16:00,252
Bhiku, what is it?
- Call me Mr. Bhikharilal.

509
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:05,122
Alright, Mr. Bhikharilal,
is my carriage ready?

510
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:11,124
It's ready. But hire a servant from
tomorrow to massage the horse.

511
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,465
What nonsense are
you talking about?

512
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:16,270
I'm only talking now.

513
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:22,042
But after I get Rs.1 0,000,
I'll be flying in air!...Read this.

514
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:29,246
The historical Red Fort...

515
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,213
...was illuminated...

516
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,988
Read the news
pertaining to the reward.

517
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:38,493
Reward of Rs.1 0,000 in cash.

518
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:44,230
Anyone finding the man responsible
for the murder at Howrah bridge...

519
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,501
...will be given a
cash prize of Rs.1 0,000.

520
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:50,497
Enough! Don't read further.
I'm the man.

521
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:53,170
Did you murder him?
- Yes.

522
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:59,913
I didn't commit the
murder, but I saw it.

523
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:01,249
What?

524
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,519
I saw four men on Howrah bridge.

525
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:08,253
A car got down.
- What!

526
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,457
Four men got down from a car.

527
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:17,189
Yes. They left a corpse
on the bridge and escaped.

528
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:20,194
Did you see it for yourself?
- Yes.

529
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:23,197
I clearly saw one of them.

530
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,540
I could recognise him anywhere.

531
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,542
Stay here. I'll be back soon.

532
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:32,547
You'll go to the police station
and keep the reward for yourself.

533
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:36,884
I'm going elsewhere. You keep
the reward. But stay here.

534
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:43,223
Don't let him go till I return.

535
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:01,576
Listen...

536
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:05,370
You talk to me with
a lot of respect now.

537
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:09,913
You know that I'll be
getting Rs.1 0,000 now.

538
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,588
I don't care for money.

539
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,717
You are already acting so snobbish.

540
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:19,188
When you get the money, your
feet won't touch the ground!

541
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:22,258
I'll be flying high!

542
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:27,601
I'll marry a girl with a motor car.

543
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:32,038
Alright, go ahead!

544
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,404
I won't talk to you.

545
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:50,271
Do you believe me now?

546
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:52,807
Yes, but don't ever
talk that way again.

547
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:58,476
By God, I spoke about some other
woman only to test your love.

548
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:00,815
I am your slave.

549
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,808
Enough. Don't give big talks!

550
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:05,981
May I say something?
- Yes.

551
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:08,485
You are very lucky.
- Why?

552
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:12,384
You loved a poor man named, Bhiku...

553
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:15,261
...and you'll be
marrying Mr. Bhikharilal.

554
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,835
What's wrong?

555
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,205
Uncle has not yet returned.

556
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,570
He must be on his way.
What's your hurry?

557
01:22:26,875 --> 01:22:30,572
I hope, uncle doesn't
end up taking my reward.

558
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:33,512
Aren't you ashamed
for talking this way?

559
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:36,841
Why should I be? It's a
matter of Rs.1 0,000. I'll leave.

560
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:38,843
Where to?
- To the police station.

561
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:41,289
Don't put hurdles when I'm
going for something auspicious.

562
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,849
I'll be back soon.

563
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:46,420
Come back soon

564
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:54,265
Mr. Rakesh.
- What are you doing here now?

565
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:55,866
Have you read today's papers?

566
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,663
The news about
finding the murderer...

567
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:02,536
I know somebody named, Bhiku,
who has witnessed the murder.

568
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:04,071
What did he see?

569
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:08,875
He was smoking opium, when he
saw 4 men dump a corpse...

570
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,478
What!

571
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:14,318
One man removed 4 cars...

572
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:17,551
Take me to him.

573
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,885
Alright. Bhiku had
opium and I am high!

574
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,889
Wait here. I'll get him here.

575
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:25,094
Alright, be quick.

576
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:36,911
A reward of Rs.10,000?

577
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:39,914
This is what I had feared...

578
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:45,511
I hope, no one divulges the truth
to the police to get this reward.

579
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,184
The taxi driver...

580
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:52,292
No. He's a trustworthy man.

581
01:23:54,295 --> 01:23:56,263
No having trust...

582
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:58,523
...no evidence...

583
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,434
...no proof...

584
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:03,938
No witnesses should
be left for the police.

585
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:09,443
I want the taxi
driver's dead body here.

586
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:12,276
You're right.

587
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:16,950
Did you hear?
The taxi driver should be...

588
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:24,481
Was anyone present there?

589
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:30,692
When the streamer light fell
on my face on Howrah bridge...

590
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:34,961
...I suspect, someone saw me.

591
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:38,965
Somebody must have
definitely seen you.

592
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,977
Find his address somehow...

593
01:24:45,013 --> 01:24:46,981
...and bring him here.

594
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:52,318
We, and not the police,
will reward him...Now go.

595
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:56,780
I feel...

596
01:24:57,192 --> 01:25:01,253
We should place our men at all the
police stations near Howrah bridge...

597
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,262
The man will definitely come
there on hearing about the reward.

598
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:14,273
Take this matter in your hands.
It's very serious.

599
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:01,045
Where are you going?
- lnside, obviously.

600
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:04,792
What do you want?
- Hush! I want to see the officer.

601
01:26:06,895 --> 01:26:07,862
Look here.

602
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:10,963
It's about the reward for
identifying the murderer.

603
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:15,397
Don't worry. I'll give you a tip.

604
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:18,402
By God...
- Shut up! Go away.

605
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:22,607
Fine! You will regret this.

606
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:27,673
I know a lot about this case. I came
to tell the lnspector about it.

607
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:32,075
But you aren't letting me in!
Goodbye. You will regret this.

608
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:39,085
Do you know anything about it?
- I swear, I do.

609
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,256
Come with me.

610
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,425
This way.

611
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:49,660
Who's he?
My suspicions are confirmed.

612
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:53,767
Go in and hear what he has to say.

613
01:26:57,579 --> 01:26:58,841
Wait here.

614
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:09,990
Who's he?

615
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,786
He has something to say
about the Howrah bridge murder.

616
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:14,128
Sit.

617
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:20,124
What do you know?
- A lot.

618
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:24,128
What do you want?
- I want to file a complaint.

619
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:26,473
Wait inside. Sir is busy.

620
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:33,747
Was there anyone else with you when
the streamer light fell on his face?

621
01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:35,946
No.
- Did you see the car number?

622
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:39,151
If I were literate, then
I'd have been an lnspector now.

623
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,487
Shut up.

624
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:45,148
Will you be able to identify the car?
- By God, I will.

625
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:47,822
It was an old black car.

626
01:27:48,196 --> 01:27:52,428
It sped so fast, that
it vanished in no time!

627
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,894
There are many such cars in Calcutta.
- Damn the car!

628
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:58,169
Arrest the man, Sir.

629
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:00,871
By God, I'll identify him.

630
01:28:01,242 --> 01:28:05,178
He was a thin man with a
dry face and a long moustache.

631
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:09,175
He looked like a ghost.
- Alright, we'll get back to you.

632
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:12,175
But the reward...

633
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:16,514
First, we'll have to track
the car, then the murderer...

634
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:20,987
We'll call you to identify him. You
will be rewarded after he's punished.

635
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:25,858
If the procedure is so long,
then why did you print...

636
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:28,329
All government matters
adhere to procedures.

637
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:32,198
Alright, I'll leave. Good-day.

638
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:36,210
What's your name?

639
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:40,544
If we are able to arrest
the murderer with your help...

640
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:42,215
...then, you'll be rewarded.

641
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:47,611
That's true. But atleast, pay
me the rickshaw fare for now.

642
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:51,217
Constable...drop him home.

643
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:14,248
You saw Bhiku
reporting to the police...

644
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:17,913
Why are you telling me this?
Why didn't you kill him?

645
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:22,689
He went with a policeman.
- Now, you go and get him.

646
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:29,920
Where is my partner?
- He has gone to Uncle Joe's hotel.

647
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:36,703
I am in a soup here and he
is busy romancing with Edna!

648
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:40,537
What about the taxi driver?
- We'll set him right now.

649
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:46,610
Go and do both the jobs.

650
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:00,092
Do you stay here?
- Yes.

651
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:03,627
Where does Bhiku live?
- The drug addict?

652
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:06,299
He lives opposite.
- This one?

653
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:09,101
Yes. What's wrong?
- Nothing.

654
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:15,970
Who's it?

655
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,303
Please come.

656
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:23,649
Don't be scared.
We have come to trouble you.

657
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:28,712
You'll have to come to the
police station to collect Rs.1 0000.

658
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:31,657
Wow! Bless you, Sir!

659
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:34,794
What's it?

660
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:38,496
Sir, kindly ask for her
permission to take me out.

661
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:42,996
We will be taking him to the
police station to reward him.

662
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:47,340
That's wonderful! Happy
days will be here now.

663
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,339
Get my coat.

664
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:54,575
Be quick.

665
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:01,683
I'll leave.

666
01:31:10,298 --> 01:31:11,890
Good-day.

667
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,369
Good-day. What brings you here?
- I'm in deep trouble.

668
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:20,968
My man, Sant Singh, took the taxi
yesterday, but has not returned.

669
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:25,368
I've looked for him everywhere.
I'll tell you, how he looks.

670
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:28,840
He is a little below five feet.

671
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,783
He is fair.

672
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:37,391
He has a mark on his
forehead and is 26 years old.

673
01:31:37,758 --> 01:31:41,888
May God bless your children! I'll
be grateful to you, if you find him.

674
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:44,194
Don't worry. We'll try our best.

675
01:31:44,432 --> 01:31:46,992
I'll be grateful.

676
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:56,402
Where's he?

677
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:08,412
You are here?...He has gone to the
police station to collect his reward.

678
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:12,020
He's been doing that the whole day?
- No.

679
01:32:12,393 --> 01:32:17,092
He had just returned. Then,
two cops took him in a black car.

680
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:19,157
Black car?
- Yes.

681
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:23,426
Just as I had thought.
- What?

682
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,173
Nothing. I'll be back soon.

683
01:32:35,483 --> 01:32:38,452
Are these crisp green notes mine?

684
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:40,787
Yes.

685
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:46,051
You may take them if you want.
- I am here to rake it.

686
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:51,158
With this money, I'll buy a shop,
a house, a horse, a carriage...

687
01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:53,467
...and will marry Chamia.

688
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:02,033
Who was with you when you saw
the murder at Howrah bridge?

689
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:06,002
I swear, I was all alone.

690
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:09,142
What did you see?

691
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:12,484
Three man got down from a car.

692
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:15,082
They removed a corpse.

693
01:33:15,456 --> 01:33:19,153
Then, the steamer light fell
on the face of one of them.

694
01:33:19,527 --> 01:33:22,087
You are lying.
You didn't see a thing.

695
01:33:22,396 --> 01:33:26,492
What are you saying?
I could identify that man anywhere.

696
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:46,519
I swear, he's that ghost.
He was the man, I saw.

697
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:47,854
No.

698
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:56,691
You have never seen him.
You just can't recognise him.

699
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:59,931
Rubbish! I, myself, saw him.

700
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:03,195
You'll have to say this
if you want Rs.10,000.

701
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,530
Is that so?
I can make double profits!

702
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:08,203
I'll get Rs.10,000 for
identifying him, from the police...

703
01:34:08,576 --> 01:34:10,976
...and the same from
you for not doing so!

704
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:14,173
But you will not go
to the police station.

705
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,551
How will I get
my reward then? Now...

706
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:22,889
What a mess I am in!

707
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:27,288
Take him away.

708
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:30,223
Have pity on me.
I don't want any reward.

709
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:34,557
I won't tell anybody a word.
Chamia will be in anguish.

710
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:39,573
Forgive me. I don't want...

711
01:34:47,548 --> 01:34:49,379
I've been waiting
for you since morning.

712
01:34:49,617 --> 01:34:52,984
What I had feared, has happened.
- What?

713
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:55,585
I went to get Bhiku, but he
had gone to the police station.

714
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:58,584
I was told there that he had
written a complaint and gone home.

715
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:01,325
I went home.
A black car passed by.

716
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:06,929
Chamia told me that he had left
in a black car. That's Chang's car.

717
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:11,260
I'll break his head...
- Quiet or we'll be in trouble.

718
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:13,470
Take me to Chang's hotel.

719
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:20,981
Where were you?
- I got Bhiku for you.

720
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:24,207
What about the merchant?
- Who?

721
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:29,614
The one, who had come
with Shamu to sell the dragon.

722
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:31,287
He's gone.

723
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:34,958
You don't understand.
He belongs to the ClD.

724
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:38,296
You're least bothered.
You'll put me also in jail with you.

725
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:42,293
You don't work.
You are busy romancing with Edna.

726
01:35:43,003 --> 01:35:45,369
You have no right to
interfere in my personal life!

727
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:49,635
What are you saying?
- The truth.

728
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:52,911
What have you done with the dragon?
- It's with me.

729
01:35:53,347 --> 01:35:55,372
Why haven't you yet sold it?
- It's none of your business.

730
01:35:55,683 --> 01:36:01,087
You can't reap its benefits alone.
Sell it soon and give me, my share.

731
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:15,066
Wait.
- What happen?

732
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:17,398
I'll walk. You wait here.

733
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:21,835
Should I inform the police,
just in case there's trouble?

734
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:23,937
Alright.

735
01:36:30,718 --> 01:36:33,414
When does the ship
to Singapore leave?

736
01:36:34,655 --> 01:36:37,249
Ten O'Clock?...Is there a seat?

737
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:39,692
Book a seat.

738
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:45,358
I'll be there.

739
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,368
What did you say?

740
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:52,706
Chang's hotel? But who are you
and where are you speaking from?

741
01:36:57,778 --> 01:37:00,372
There's going to be
trouble at Chang's hotel.

742
01:37:00,848 --> 01:37:03,043
But the informant
didn't divulge his name.

743
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:10,777
Your partner.

744
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:13,854
What are you doing here?

745
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:19,285
I came to see the change
in my partner's intentions.

746
01:38:20,828 --> 01:38:24,457
What nonsense are you talking?

747
01:38:24,865 --> 01:38:26,799
Where are you going?

748
01:38:27,835 --> 01:38:30,360
Don't you know, the
police are on the alert?

749
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:33,366
So you're escaping with the goods?
- What goods?

750
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:37,607
What's in it?
- Some personal papers.

751
01:38:38,145 --> 01:38:39,806
I have a right to half of this.

752
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:42,548
What nonsense are you talking?
- Open it.

753
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:45,810
I won't.
- I'll open it.

754
01:38:46,787 --> 01:38:48,084
You will?

755
01:38:50,057 --> 01:38:52,150
Alright, open it.

756
01:39:44,912 --> 01:39:48,348
Now you plead! Open it.

757
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:50,984
Why aren't you opening it?

758
01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:55,888
I'll open it for you.

759
01:40:02,196 --> 01:40:06,565
See this...this cash...

760
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:09,698
...this Chinese dragon...

761
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:11,972
...all these belong to Chang.

762
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:14,907
I'll take them all.

763
01:40:15,275 --> 01:40:18,574
And you...you will be dead!

764
01:40:18,946 --> 01:40:21,915
No, don't do that...I got greedy...

765
01:40:23,951 --> 01:40:26,920
You are apologising only
because I have a revolver.

766
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:30,415
I'll never come in your way.
Forgive me!

767
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:32,918
I'm going.

768
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:38,928
Wait.

769
01:40:40,567 --> 01:40:42,933
You said 'sorry'?
- Yes.

770
01:40:43,437 --> 01:40:44,927
You apologised?

771
01:40:46,073 --> 01:40:48,337
You apologised because
you were in the wrong.

772
01:40:50,978 --> 01:40:52,946
Chang won't let you go empty handed.

773
01:40:55,983 --> 01:40:57,951
Take some cash.

774
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:29,642
Who's in?

775
01:41:31,018 --> 01:41:32,781
Open the door!

776
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:49,397
Open the door!

777
01:42:48,695 --> 01:42:50,060
Who's it?

778
01:43:21,128 --> 01:43:23,756
Call the police station soon.
- Why?

779
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,430
Chang has been murdered.
- What!

780
01:43:35,142 --> 01:43:36,541
What's wrong?

781
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:40,443
I just called you up.
- Why?

782
01:43:42,349 --> 01:43:44,681
My partner, Chang has been murdered.
- Murdered?

783
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:48,586
I got a call 20 minutes back and
there was no mention of a murder.

784
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:51,791
You got a call?
- Yes.

785
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:54,127
I was only told that
there would be trouble.

786
01:43:56,496 --> 01:44:00,125
It implies that the
murderer had an accomplice.

787
01:44:01,268 --> 01:44:04,931
I have locked the murderer.
Come with me.

788
01:44:19,586 --> 01:44:21,554
Come in.
- Where did the murder take place?

789
01:44:26,193 --> 01:44:28,161
The murderer is in this room.

790
01:44:28,395 --> 01:44:31,159
Stay where you are. If you
act too smart, you'll be shot.

791
01:44:32,199 --> 01:44:33,962
It'll be best if you surrender.

792
01:44:34,268 --> 01:44:36,498
Where's the switch?
- Babu, switch on the light.

793
01:44:40,207 --> 01:44:43,608
There's only the corpse here.
- Sir, he has escaped.

794
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:50,174
Take the body. Don't let anyone
touch anything in this room.

795
01:45:06,033 --> 01:45:08,900
Whose is it?
- I had seen it with Joe's customer.

796
01:45:09,336 --> 01:45:11,531
How did it land here?
- He may be the murderer.

797
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,303
Do you know him?
- Yes.

798
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:15,202
Come with me.

799
01:45:20,647 --> 01:45:22,205
Who's it?

800
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:24,717
You?

801
01:45:25,252 --> 01:45:27,720
You've come?
- What are you doing here?

802
01:45:28,255 --> 01:45:31,884
I had got you food.
I dozed off, waiting for you.

803
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:36,558
Where were you? You've come so late.

804
01:45:41,268 --> 01:45:43,236
You're perspiring.

805
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:47,902
I have a headache.
- I'll get some medicines.

806
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:50,766
No. I'll get better by morning.

807
01:45:51,278 --> 01:45:53,246
You don't ever listen to me.

808
01:45:57,651 --> 01:46:00,245
But where is my cigarette case?
- Where is it?

809
01:46:01,221 --> 01:46:03,655
I must have dropped it there.
- Where?

810
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:06,054
...On the streets.

811
01:46:07,294 --> 01:46:09,922
Let's go and get it.
- There's no need. I'm not well.

812
01:46:10,297 --> 01:46:12,060
Why are you screaming at me?

813
01:46:12,999 --> 01:46:14,967
I understand everything.
- What?

814
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:19,931
You are unwell. So rest.

815
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:43,693
Mr Rakesh.

816
01:46:49,669 --> 01:46:51,637
What is it?
- Hurry up

817
01:47:04,151 --> 01:47:06,051
What happened?
- A blunder has happened.

818
01:47:06,286 --> 01:47:08,914
Pyarelal has put all the blame on you.
- On me?

819
01:47:09,289 --> 01:47:11,314
Yes. You had left your cigarette case
there. Police found it.

820
01:47:11,625 --> 01:47:13,490
I thought so, that my cigarette case
must have fallen there.

821
01:47:13,693 --> 01:47:15,456
Police will be here any moment.
Let's flee from here.

822
01:47:15,629 --> 01:47:17,597
Where to?
- Come with me. Don't be afraid.

823
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,360
Where is Rakesh?

824
01:47:55,735 --> 01:47:57,532
You haven't told me where Rakesh
has gone, have you?

825
01:47:57,737 --> 01:47:59,170
I don't know.

826
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:02,374
Don't try to do anything
against the Law, Miss Edna.

827
01:48:02,642 --> 01:48:04,166
You'll get into trouble if
you do that, Madam.

828
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:07,380
Tell them the truth, Edna.
Where has that man gone?

829
01:48:07,747 --> 01:48:09,715
I've spoken the truth, Uncle.
I don't know anything!

830
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:12,711
But what is all this about?
- Rakesh has committed a murder.

831
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:20,985
That is true, Edna.
Rakesh has killed Chang.

832
01:48:22,696 --> 01:48:25,824
This can't be true!
It must be all wrong!

833
01:48:26,466 --> 01:48:29,401
Rakesh can never do that!
How could he ever...!

834
01:48:31,071 --> 01:48:33,062
The police have evidence
against Rakesh.

835
01:48:33,373 --> 01:48:36,399
It would be good for you
tell them whatever you know.

836
01:48:36,743 --> 01:48:38,540
What will I tell them,
when I know nothing?

837
01:48:38,778 --> 01:48:41,076
Think it over.
Try to remember it, Madam!

838
01:48:41,448 --> 01:48:43,678
You have helped the
murderer, Miss Edna.

839
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:46,408
I have helped no one!
- It's a crime to abet a criminal!

840
01:48:46,887 --> 01:48:50,084
Oh no, sir!
My Edna's an honest-to-God girl!

841
01:48:50,457 --> 01:48:53,426
She'd never lie! She'll tell you
everything she knows!

842
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:56,155
Search the room, constables.

843
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:36,469
Prem Kumar?
What does that mean?

844
01:49:36,803 --> 01:49:38,896
It means his real
name is Prem Kumar.

845
01:49:39,573 --> 01:49:43,805
You could see the lighter, lnspector.
It has P.K. for initials.

846
01:49:45,512 --> 01:49:48,242
He had obviously planned this.
- That is beyond any doubt!

847
01:49:48,515 --> 01:49:50,483
Why else would he
assume a false name?

848
01:49:50,684 --> 01:49:53,653
I can't believe this!

849
01:49:53,853 --> 01:49:56,151
Everything he said and did
were a pack of lies too!

850
01:49:56,523 --> 01:49:58,821
Do you know anything more
about him, Mr Pyarelal?

851
01:49:59,526 --> 01:50:02,962
Miss Edna can answer this
question for you, lnspector.

852
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:07,491
Why are you getting me into trouble?
Haven't I said, I know nothing?!

853
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:09,735
I'll get to the bottom
of it, in that case!

854
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:11,665
You will have to come with
me to the Police Station.

855
01:50:11,871 --> 01:50:15,170
Oh no, sir! We are innocent!
Edna doesn't know anything!

856
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:18,773
Why should you be scared, when
we have done nothing? Come on!

857
01:50:22,983 --> 01:50:25,679
This is not an ordinary case.
It has to do with murder.

858
01:50:26,987 --> 01:50:29,922
If he hasn't committed the murder,
then why did he run away?

859
01:50:32,559 --> 01:50:35,960
He must have been scared.
- Why should he have been scared?

860
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:42,535
If he's innocent, he should've proved
it by surrendering to the police.

861
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:49,803
But why are you asking
me all these questions?

862
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:55,145
Because he had a relation with you.
You should know something about this.

863
01:50:55,949 --> 01:50:57,814
But he never told me
about anything.

864
01:50:58,051 --> 01:51:00,952
Didn't you even know that his name
was Prem Kumar and not Rakesh?

865
01:51:01,287 --> 01:51:02,879
By God, I don't know!

866
01:51:03,089 --> 01:51:06,354
Which means he fooled
you with his love!

867
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,560
I can't believe it,
that he'd deceive me.

868
01:51:08,862 --> 01:51:11,160
I can't even believe that
he's killed Chang!

869
01:51:12,599 --> 01:51:17,059
He's a very nice man.
I'll prove it, that he's innocent.

870
01:51:17,604 --> 01:51:19,572
How can you prove that,
without knowing anything?

871
01:51:19,873 --> 01:51:22,239
Or without even meeting him?

872
01:51:22,609 --> 01:51:25,976
Or how will you meet him,
when you don't know his whereabouts?

873
01:51:26,346 --> 01:51:28,314
Nevertheless, I will
search for him.

874
01:51:28,615 --> 01:51:30,583
Where will you find him,
in such a big city?

875
01:51:31,051 --> 01:51:33,019
I will look for him everywhere!

876
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:35,321
You will need the help of
the police for that.

877
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:39,083
No thank you, lnspector.
I will prove that he's innocent.

878
01:51:40,126 --> 01:51:42,321
Well, okay then...
...you may leave now.

879
01:51:48,668 --> 01:51:50,397
Come along, Uncle.

880
01:52:05,085 --> 01:52:07,610
See that girl there?
...Follow her.

881
01:58:55,862 --> 01:58:58,023
I say, Madam...!
My cab's not free.

882
01:58:58,397 --> 01:59:01,491
Move aside...the cab's
certainly free for Madam!

883
01:59:02,001 --> 01:59:04,196
Well then, where do you
want to go, Madam?

884
01:59:05,104 --> 01:59:08,562
You'll have to explain
everything to her in English!

885
01:59:12,078 --> 01:59:13,773
I don't wish to go anywhere.

886
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,471
Do you see that man there...?
He's a perfect scoundrel!

887
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:19,846
The one in the trousers and shirt.
- The scoundrel!

888
01:59:22,388 --> 01:59:24,049
Don't you have womenfolk at home?

889
01:59:24,323 --> 01:59:26,655
You should be ashamed to
chase a girl like this!

890
01:59:27,093 --> 01:59:29,721
You don't understand, Sardarji!
She belongs to a notorious gang!

891
01:59:30,096 --> 01:59:32,064
And you're the decent one, eh?
Get lost now!

892
01:59:32,431 --> 01:59:34,399
Else, I'll beat you to pulp!

893
01:59:34,767 --> 01:59:38,498
What nonsense is this! Take
a look...I belong to the C.I.D.

894
01:59:41,107 --> 01:59:42,802
By God! I've made a mistake!

895
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:45,669
Hey, Gitta Singh!
Get a chair quickly!

896
01:59:46,045 --> 01:59:49,674
And you...get some butter-milk.
The "CD's" come to our house!

897
01:59:50,149 --> 01:59:52,743
I say, sir...Iisten
to a request.

898
01:59:53,152 --> 01:59:56,087
Our driver, Sant Singh, is
untraceable for many days now.

899
01:59:56,389 --> 02:00:00,018
Listen to the description; he's
a little below 5 feet.

900
02:00:00,459 --> 02:00:04,691
He's fair like I am...and has a
moustache like the one I sport too!

901
02:00:05,131 --> 02:00:07,497
I'll listen to that later.
But tell me where the girl is!

902
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:11,099
Don't you worry, C.D.!
She's sitting in the car!

903
02:00:11,837 --> 02:00:14,101
Say, Kartar Singh...where
has the Ma'am flown?

904
02:00:14,473 --> 02:00:17,442
She was sitting in the car!

905
02:00:18,144 --> 02:00:21,113
A calamity, sir!
She seems to have flown!

906
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:23,380
You've spoilt the show!
Move aside now!

907
02:00:23,583 --> 02:00:28,543
But Mr C.D...don't forget the
description of a little below 5 feet!

908
02:00:37,597 --> 02:00:40,566
Where's Shamu?
- You're here, Madam?

909
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:42,868
Where's Shamu?
This is important.

910
02:00:43,169 --> 02:00:46,798
It is important that meet
Rakesh immediately.

911
02:00:47,273 --> 02:00:49,468
Rakesh? Who is that?

912
02:00:50,576 --> 02:00:53,670
I know everything...Rakesh
came here with Shamu.

913
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:57,149
You know it, too.
- I don't know anything.

914
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:02,852
You don't know it, do you?
Look at me...

915
02:01:03,189 --> 02:01:05,157
Where is he?
Tell me.

916
02:01:05,658 --> 02:01:07,751
But Madam...there's danger here.

917
02:01:08,194 --> 02:01:10,162
I know that.

918
02:01:10,563 --> 02:01:12,861
Where is he?
- You won't tell anyone, will you?

919
02:01:13,232 --> 02:01:16,497
I won't!
I promise you that!

920
02:01:17,603 --> 02:01:21,164
Don't tell anyone.
- I promise; I won't.

921
02:01:21,574 --> 02:01:23,542
Not anyone?
- No one!

922
02:01:41,327 --> 02:01:43,124
It's me, Chhamiya, sir.

923
02:01:59,245 --> 02:02:01,805
It's good that you came here.
I was thinking of meeting you.

924
02:02:02,048 --> 02:02:04,016
I need your help, Edna.

925
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:07,219
You want to trap me in your moves
with your sweet-talk, do you?

926
02:02:07,586 --> 02:02:09,713
Trap? What trap?
What are you talking about?

927
02:02:10,256 --> 02:02:13,384
You're asking me! I've come
to know everything about you!

928
02:02:13,693 --> 02:02:15,388
About me?!
What have you come to know?

929
02:02:15,594 --> 02:02:18,563
What I didn't know...I always
thought you were a very nice man.

930
02:02:19,198 --> 02:02:22,224
But you've killed a man!
You've even betrayed my love!

931
02:02:22,635 --> 02:02:24,967
You don't know anything!
I have not killed anyone!

932
02:02:25,338 --> 02:02:27,602
Nor have I betrayed you.
This is what I wanted to tell you.

933
02:02:29,275 --> 02:02:31,971
How dare you enter someone house
when it's womenfolk are alone?

934
02:02:32,278 --> 02:02:34,075
What are you talking about?
I've got to search the place.

935
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:38,239
Why? Are criminals staying here?
Or has a murder taken place?!

936
02:02:38,517 --> 02:02:40,075
You can search the place
when Shamu Uncle is here.

937
02:02:40,286 --> 02:02:41,981
It's a crime to
obstruct the Law.

938
02:02:42,288 --> 02:02:43,983
Move aside now!

939
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:46,553
Who's in there?!
Who is it?

940
02:02:46,726 --> 02:02:48,694
So, you've brought the police
with you, have you?

941
02:02:49,295 --> 02:02:51,058
You have no idea why
I'm hiding from the police

942
02:02:51,297 --> 02:02:53,527
What do you know of the
harm you're causing to me!

943
02:02:59,372 --> 02:03:01,340
Not there...this way!

944
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:04,871
So you can hand me over to them, eh?
- No, Rakesh! Please listen to me!

945
02:03:05,311 --> 02:03:07,279
Open the door! Open up!

946
02:03:12,585 --> 02:03:15,281
What is it? What is the fuss about?
Who the hell are you?

947
02:03:16,655 --> 02:03:18,623
You'll know that very soon.
Where is he?

948
02:03:19,325 --> 02:03:21,293
Who's "he"?
- Chang's killer, Rakesh.

949
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:23,628
Alias Prem Kumar, to meet
whom you came here!

950
02:03:23,829 --> 02:03:26,297
Oh come on!
I've come here to meet my friend.

951
02:03:26,732 --> 02:03:28,700
I'll go anywhere I please.

952
02:03:31,771 --> 02:03:33,739
And why are you taking my packet?

953
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:37,300
Will you smoke?
- Tell me where he is!

954
02:03:38,144 --> 02:03:40,874
Here he is...in my purse.
Take a look!

955
02:03:43,649 --> 02:03:45,514
Haven't I said l
don't know anything?

956
02:03:45,718 --> 02:03:47,515
Then why are you bothering me?

957
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:49,688
I noticed you following me
on the streets too!

958
02:03:49,989 --> 02:03:53,049
Fooling with me, eh?
Get lost now, will you!

959
02:03:53,692 --> 02:03:56,661
I will...but I'll deal with you.
- Sure!

960
02:04:10,376 --> 02:04:12,003
Where is he?

961
02:04:12,378 --> 02:04:14,346
He must be around.
Come along.

962
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:19,445
Sir! Sir!

963
02:04:20,386 --> 02:04:23,355
You keep watch, Chhamiya...just
in case the cops return.

964
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:26,357
I'll check the boat

965
02:04:36,535 --> 02:04:39,163
The police has left;
you've escaped.

966
02:04:41,407 --> 02:04:44,035
Strange! You call the
police yourself and then...

967
02:04:44,410 --> 02:04:46,378
I speak the truth!
I didn't call the police.

968
02:04:47,079 --> 02:04:49,047
How should I know who
called the police?

969
02:04:49,281 --> 02:04:51,374
You wanted to get me arrested,
a little while ago. Right?

970
02:04:53,819 --> 02:04:57,721
You heard what I said; but you
didn't understand my feelings.

971
02:04:59,425 --> 02:05:02,826
Do you really think I can
hand you over to the police?

972
02:05:05,431 --> 02:05:07,729
You don't know how
much I care for you...

973
02:05:08,434 --> 02:05:10,732
I know...
- You don't! You're stone-hearted!

974
02:05:11,437 --> 02:05:13,735
You can't understand a person's
feelings...her anguish!

975
02:05:14,106 --> 02:05:16,074
I wish the police
had taken you away!

976
02:05:16,542 --> 02:05:21,206
Edna, l...
- And I told the police...

977
02:05:21,447 --> 02:05:23,210
...that Rakesh could
never kill anyone.

978
02:05:23,516 --> 02:05:25,746
But I haven't...
- Why are you lying again!

979
02:05:26,552 --> 02:05:28,986
I'm speaking the truth, Edna.
I'm a victim of their conspiracy.

980
02:05:29,488 --> 02:05:31,820
In fact, Pyarelal
has killed Chang.

981
02:05:32,124 --> 02:05:34,422
Pyarelal!
Why should he do this?

982
02:05:35,261 --> 02:05:37,422
It's a long story, which l
have never told you about.

983
02:05:37,796 --> 02:05:39,423
But why?
- Because I thought...

984
02:05:39,632 --> 02:05:41,429
...you were one of them, too.

985
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:45,861
I see! That is why you pretended
to be in love with me!

986
02:05:46,472 --> 02:05:49,441
That is the past; I want to
tell you the whole truth now.

987
02:05:49,808 --> 02:05:52,174
Yes!
You must tell me the truth now!

988
02:05:52,478 --> 02:05:54,776
Or I'd think you're
still pretending with me!

989
02:06:09,495 --> 02:06:11,053
Who's sitting in the room?

990
02:06:11,297 --> 02:06:13,458
Mr Pyarelal is here; he's
having a chat with the boss.

991
02:06:17,503 --> 02:06:20,472
Come with me. It's important.
- Very well, Madam.

992
02:06:23,742 --> 02:06:25,266
You're finding it funny, Uncle...

993
02:06:25,511 --> 02:06:28,947
...but Chang's partner has inherited
a lot of wealth after his death.

994
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:35,952
But of what use is the wealth?
- Why so?

995
02:06:36,522 --> 02:06:38,820
With something...
- And what is that?

996
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:43,760
Do you want to marry Edna?

997
02:06:44,863 --> 02:06:47,832
If you marry Edna, what
will happen of my hotel?

998
02:06:48,267 --> 02:06:50,827
What will I do? It's because of
Edna that I've got a business.

999
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:53,104
You can stay with us then, uncle.

1000
02:06:54,406 --> 02:06:56,271
But who will bear
the loss that I suffer?

1001
02:06:56,875 --> 02:06:59,309
How much will you lose?
How much money do you want?

1002
02:07:00,546 --> 02:07:03,709
We are in the same business, Pyarelal.
You know what I'd expect.

1003
02:07:04,984 --> 02:07:07,248
Would you be happy, if l
gave you a lakh of rupees?

1004
02:07:07,886 --> 02:07:09,854
One lakh!
- Yes...

1005
02:07:10,155 --> 02:07:13,181
...if Edna agrees to marry me,
I'll give you a lakh of rupees.

1006
02:07:13,459 --> 02:07:15,256
Why won't she agree?
I'll order her to agree!

1007
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:20,531
Are you selling me away?

1008
02:07:23,569 --> 02:07:25,332
And you're buying me, are you?

1009
02:07:25,638 --> 02:07:29,540
Don't be angry. I love you so much,
that I can't live without you.

1010
02:07:29,908 --> 02:07:33,036
Then why are you buying me?
I already belong to you!

1011
02:07:33,579 --> 02:07:35,342
What?!
- It's true!

1012
02:07:39,652 --> 02:07:42,553
I love Pyarelal very much
and I will marry him!

1013
02:07:44,523 --> 02:07:46,548
You will marry him!
What about my money, Pyarelal?

1014
02:07:46,959 --> 02:07:50,292
What money?
It's a love-marriage!

1015
02:07:50,729 --> 02:07:52,094
Let's go, Pyare!

1016
02:07:52,698 --> 02:07:54,563
Where are you taking Edna?

1017
02:07:54,767 --> 02:07:59,568
Pyare isn't taking Edna...
Edna's taking Pyare, Uncle!

1018
02:08:02,641 --> 02:08:04,973
I haven't got the money...
...and Edna's gone, too!

1019
02:08:11,717 --> 02:08:13,582
Greetings!
- What is it?

1020
02:08:13,852 --> 02:08:15,376
Uncle Shamu hasn't returned.

1021
02:08:15,621 --> 02:08:19,079
Miss Edna has sent a note for him.
- A note? Let me see.

1022
02:08:22,628 --> 02:08:24,858
Okay then...I'll give it to
Uncle when he returns.

1023
02:08:32,071 --> 02:08:34,665
Miss Edna's servant has
brought this letter, Sir.

1024
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:45,047
Where's Shamu?
- At the Hill Top Hotel.

1025
02:08:45,551 --> 02:08:47,348
Ask him to come to Chang's hotel...

1026
02:08:47,653 --> 02:08:50,622
...and to call the police
when he hears gun-shots.

1027
02:08:51,023 --> 02:08:53,617
Gun-shots!
Is everything okay, sir?

1028
02:08:53,892 --> 02:08:55,621
Yes. Hurry now.

1029
02:09:03,402 --> 02:09:05,302
What are you looking at, darling?

1030
02:09:05,671 --> 02:09:08,799
What I notice is that...everything
seems to have changed here.

1031
02:09:09,108 --> 02:09:11,076
What has changed?

1032
02:09:11,677 --> 02:09:15,636
All this belonged to someone
else earlier. And now...

1033
02:09:16,682 --> 02:09:20,083
It's yours now.
You own everything.

1034
02:09:22,554 --> 02:09:26,991
You're so lovable, Pyare!
But I'm scared for you now!

1035
02:09:27,392 --> 02:09:30,190
Why? What's up?
- Didn't I tell you...

1036
02:09:30,696 --> 02:09:33,665
that man from Rangoon
wants to trap you.

1037
02:09:33,966 --> 02:09:35,524
How can he, when he's
trapped himself?

1038
02:09:35,768 --> 02:09:42,003
I know that. But what is that
royal-jewellery...?

1039
02:09:42,374 --> 02:09:44,842
What Chinese-dragon?
- That's the cause of the fights!

1040
02:09:45,110 --> 02:09:48,102
He says that it's because of the
dragon that you killed Chang.

1041
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:51,347
It's a lie. He killed Chang!
- I know that, darling...

1042
02:09:51,717 --> 02:09:54,345
...but you must keep that
dragon in a safe place.

1043
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:57,054
It's at a place where nobody
can ever know about it!

1044
02:09:58,791 --> 02:10:02,352
But Rakesh knows where it is.
- How does he know?

1045
02:10:02,795 --> 02:10:06,492
Beats me. But if he informs the
police, they'd come here...

1046
02:10:06,965 --> 02:10:10,366
...and they'd certainly find it.
- Yes. That's true.

1047
02:10:10,736 --> 02:10:13,364
And then...you'd be arrested
for Chang's murder!

1048
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:17,708
You must quickly hide
the dragon elsewhere.

1049
02:10:18,410 --> 02:10:20,378
Else, we'd be caught!

1050
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:24,114
Isn't that so?
- You're right, Edna. Come along.

1051
02:10:32,758 --> 02:10:36,387
Is this the room? I see!
And where have you hidden the dragon?

1052
02:10:36,762 --> 02:10:38,730
It's in there.
- Get it out quickly.

1053
02:10:47,873 --> 02:10:49,534
Take a look.
How precious it is!

1054
02:10:49,708 --> 02:10:52,734
We'll see that later. Let's go.
We've no time now.

1055
02:10:53,111 --> 02:10:55,636
But I have all the time!
- It's you!

1056
02:10:55,914 --> 02:10:59,145
I've come to decide things...
and where are you hiding, Edna?

1057
02:10:59,785 --> 02:11:02,413
I always suspected that you're one of
them and that you're making moves.

1058
02:11:02,788 --> 02:11:04,278
Don't move!

1059
02:11:04,890 --> 02:11:08,656
You pretended to be in love with me
and passed on information to them!

1060
02:11:11,563 --> 02:11:14,191
I had told you, Pyarelal...
he's not a good man!

1061
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:18,161
He wants to trap all of us.
And I asked you to escape quickly!

1062
02:11:18,604 --> 02:11:21,198
There's no escape now.
I've informed the police.

1063
02:11:25,143 --> 02:11:27,373
You're lying!
You can't do that!

1064
02:11:27,813 --> 02:11:29,781
You'd be arrested
for murdering Chang!

1065
02:11:30,115 --> 02:11:32,310
We'll know very soon as
to who murdered Chang.

1066
02:11:32,618 --> 02:11:35,314
But first handover
the dragon to me.

1067
02:11:43,829 --> 02:11:50,200
Speak up now...do you want
to know who killed Chang?

1068
02:11:51,003 --> 02:11:53,801
It's I who has killed Chang.

1069
02:11:54,773 --> 02:11:56,798
I was the one to kill
your brother, too.

1070
02:11:57,209 --> 02:11:59,677
And now...
...it's your turn!

1071
02:12:16,261 --> 02:12:18,491
Why did you kill him?
We could have escaped anyway!

1072
02:12:19,197 --> 02:12:21,165
I have committed the third murder.

1073
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:24,630
We're doomed, boss!
The police have surrounded us.

1074
02:12:24,937 --> 02:12:27,497
You'd better be careful. Some of
them are coming towards your room.

1075
02:12:33,879 --> 02:12:35,847
Why are you getting scared?

1076
02:12:36,214 --> 02:12:38,512
We'll say that he came to kill us
and that...

1077
02:12:38,884 --> 02:12:40,852
he got killed instead.
Is that okay?

1078
02:12:41,153 --> 02:12:43,121
You must also say that he's
the one who killed Chang.

1079
02:12:43,322 --> 02:12:46,018
But you killed Chang!
- Okay; the police don't know that.

1080
02:12:48,226 --> 02:12:50,524
Go and open the door...and
give that to me.

1081
02:12:57,035 --> 02:12:59,003
What's going on over here?
- It's good that you've come.

1082
02:12:59,338 --> 02:13:01,465
Shamu informed me that Chang's
murderer is hiding here.

1083
02:13:01,673 --> 02:13:03,538
The one you're looking for.
- Where is he?

1084
02:13:03,775 --> 02:13:05,606
Tell them everything, Edna.

1085
02:13:07,846 --> 02:13:10,337
I don't know anything!
- What's wrong with you?

1086
02:13:12,985 --> 02:13:14,953
Chang's killer came
to kill us too...

1087
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:17,686
...there was a scuffle
and his own bullet killed him.

1088
02:13:18,190 --> 02:13:20,283
Mr Rakesh has been shot!
- There's the body.

1089
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:24,690
Wait! Take the body in
your possession, constables.

1090
02:13:25,931 --> 02:13:28,092
You must to come to the police
station to give your statement.

1091
02:13:29,368 --> 02:13:31,893
But I already have his
statement, lnspector.

1092
02:13:34,006 --> 02:13:35,906
I'll make you listen to it.

1093
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:43,905
How are you?
You really had me scared!

1094
02:13:44,149 --> 02:13:45,912
But you knew that they were
only blanks that he fired.

1095
02:13:46,051 --> 02:13:47,712
And you fell as if
struck by real bullets!

1096
02:13:47,953 --> 02:13:51,912
Fake-bullets! How could he
die then, Mr Pyarelal!

1097
02:13:52,357 --> 02:13:54,257
What's all this about?
I haven't understood it.

1098
02:13:54,559 --> 02:13:56,390
I'll explain, lnspector.

1099
02:14:05,237 --> 02:14:06,932
That's a recorder.
- You're right.

1100
02:14:07,239 --> 02:14:09,469
You can hear this scoundrel's
statement in his own voice.

1101
02:14:17,315 --> 02:14:19,545
"You're lying!
You can't do this"

1102
02:14:19,985 --> 02:14:21,953
"The police will take you
away for killing Chang!"

1103
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:24,288
"You will know very soon
as to who killed Chang"

1104
02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:27,122
"Give that dragon to me. Come on"

1105
02:14:36,068 --> 02:14:40,300
"Speak up now. Do you want
to know who killed Chang?"

1106
02:14:41,006 --> 02:14:43,975
"It's l...I was the one
who killed Chang"

1107
02:14:44,443 --> 02:14:46,502
"l was the one to have
killed your brother, too"

1108
02:14:47,145 --> 02:14:49,636
"And now...
...it's your turn"

1109
02:15:08,033 --> 02:15:12,333
Where's Rakesh?
Where has he gone?

1110
02:15:13,038 --> 02:15:14,801
He must have gone this.
- There's no way there.

1111
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:18,009
He must have gone from here;
it goes straight outside.

1112
02:15:20,412 --> 02:15:23,609
There's someone shouting in there.
- That's Bhiku's voice!

1113
02:15:30,055 --> 02:15:32,023
Leave him alone now
and come along!

1114
02:20:08,199 --> 02:20:10,167
Stay here, I'll go up there.
Come constable

1115
02:22:37,482 --> 02:22:40,007
Please convey my regards
to your father...

1116
02:22:40,919 --> 02:22:43,012
...and tell him that
I often remember him.

1117
02:22:43,221 --> 02:22:44,245
Sure.

1118
02:22:44,822 --> 02:22:46,016
Let's go
