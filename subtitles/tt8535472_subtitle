1
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,770
Bride ran away!

2
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,810
Seems, she doesn't like the groom.

3
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,650
Groom ran away, too.
Seems, he likes the bride.

4
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,810
Seems, they don't like them both.

5
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,060
Three...

6
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Four...

7
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,270
Five...

8
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Six...

9
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,770
Seven...

10
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
Wait, wait.

11
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,270
Do you all like her so much?

12
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,650
She likes all of us!

13
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,480
Eight brands with a single soda!
Hey you go.

14
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,150
What happened?

15
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,310
I helped to escape 8 groom and a bride.

16
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,350
Enough!

17
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,350
Jacket, you thought to become
minister, doing marriages?

18
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,270
You became MLA, stitching jackets.

19
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,100
I am cleverer than you,
as I became MLA, by rigging.

20
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,810
Hey, what will you answer,
when minister asked about those 25 couples?

21
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,600
Uh! Do you need the poster?

22
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,940
Minister, you haven't considered me, though
am servicing to the party about 25 years.

23
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,190
You are supporting to him,
who stitched your wife jackets.

24
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,600
Are you against me?

25
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,650
Look at his face, like a full moon.

26
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,230
Brother, why are you
shredding your own poster?

27
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,850
No one should doubt on us.

28
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,850
What are you doing, dear?

29
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,166
You have not stopped your tailoring
activity, even after you became MLA.

30
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,310
The great Ramojirao will
have his own pickles daily.

31
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,270
We should not forget the past.

32
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,230
Ok, did you remember what I said yesterday?

33
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,560
Wait, I will recollect.

34
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,900
Yesterday morning at 5
o'clock, cock has crowd.

35
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,190
Enough, do you at least remember
about marriages of 25 couples?

36
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,400
How would I forget it?
I will become famous after this event.

37
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,230
Oh yes, phone rings as a good sign.

38
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,520
Hello...

39
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,230
Sir, 8 grooms and one bride are escaped
from here.

40
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,940
Oh dear.

41
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,270
I feel like my heart is
getting stitched on machine.

42
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,230
What happened?

43
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,100
8 grooms and one bride are
escaped, it seems.

44
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,996
Why do you worry about it, you can
take help from your follower Veerababu.

45
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,020
Give it to me.

46
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,810
Hey, call Veerababu.

47
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,060
Hey, Veerababu is kidnapping youngsters, as grooms
are shortage for marriages conducted by MLA.

48
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,100
Don't go to town side.

49
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:19,810
(WHO IS HE...? WHO CARRYING YOU.?
WHOM IS HE BORN TO...?)

50
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,100
Hey...

51
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,020
Not just town side,
shouldn't go to pond side too.

52
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,100
Leave me.

53
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,150
Leave me.

54
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,400
Bars should be open by 6 a.m.

55
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,036
Drinkers should be provided with pension.

56
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,206
They should be freely delivered to home,
after completely exhausted.

57
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,900
Get in. Why...?

58
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
Home delivery.

59
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,150
Gov't responded so soon!

60
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Let's go.

61
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,900
Sir, I am single, please give me something.

62
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,230
I'll give you a wife.

63
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,270
Get in.
Oh...!

64
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,060
Hey catch it...

65
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,560
Catch it...

66
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,850
Catch.

67
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,850
Out.

68
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,230
Hey, Leave me.

69
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,480
Sir, I have a best offer for you,
if you buy paste, brush is free.

70
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,600
We have even better offer for you.
What's that?

71
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,076
If you get married,
you will get a golden ring free. Is it?

72
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Come on... take him.

73
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,060
Come on... move.

74
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,230
Why you are behind me, leave me.

75
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,400
Hey stop.

76
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,900
Veerababu, what about this mug?

77
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,190
Take it, can be used to wash his legs.

78
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,020
Damn...! I took it to wash my
seat, not for feet.

79
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,650
This is called fate. Let's go.

80
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,400
No one else know that we three are
here, is it? No.

81
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Except we four, nobody knows.

82
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,310
Catch them.

83
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,350
Come on take him.

84
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,400
Veerababu, we need one more.

85
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,690
One more, is it?
We should get him.

86
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,400
(GIVE ME ONE GREAT KISS...)

87
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,650
Sorry uncle, I thought it is Krishnaveni.

88
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,560
It is just 30 minutes you got wedding
cards, you already went on dreams.

89
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,350
Thank god I am not bleeding.

90
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,786
Uncle come back home after
distributing cards at Gopalapeta.

91
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,850
Suribabu.
Veerababu, hug me.

92
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,286
Happy Friendship dude.
Same to you.

93
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,400
Why you are so late?

94
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,980
I got wedding cards in the morning,
I just placed the first card at temple.

95
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,850
So, I got late.

96
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,100
Hey, you took my bananas.

97
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,230
Sorry uncle.

98
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,166
I thought it is mine, as it was besides me.

99
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,310
Hey, you come, he is thinking that
everything besides him is belongs to him.

100
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,900
Hey what's this dude?

101
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,650
I don't know what I am doing,
in the happiness of my marriage.

102
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,940
Hey, at any cost, my marriage should be
done with blessings of our MLA, Jacket.

103
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,270
Okay dude...
He is there at wedding hall itself.

104
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,376
You can meet him and get it done.

105
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,770
Jacket Janakiram, long live.

106
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,520
Jacket Janakiram, long live.

107
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,060
Jacket Janakiram, long live.

108
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,310
Greetings...

109
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,376
You want to get married with your blessings.
Is it?

110
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,456
Hey speak out, dude.
Yes Sir.

111
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,286
It's my good luck to get
married with your blessings.

112
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,230
No, it's my good luck.

113
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,650
Hey, take him inside and treat well.

114
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,230
Sure.

115
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,310
Wedding card...

116
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,150
It's not a good sign,
we will give it later.

117
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,230
Let's get in.
Please go.

118
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,810
Reddy, Suri has come, give him tea.

119
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,650
No one will doubt if I
drink alcohol in a teacup.

120
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,940
It's so strong.

121
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,400
Is it stronger than this?

122
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Which brand is that?

123
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,160
I think it is Red Label.
Give it to me.

124
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,350
Hey.

125
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,650
Is it tea?

126
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,650
What did you think about?

127
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,980
I thought it is another Red Label.

128
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,690
Sorry.

129
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,940
Oh God, he made his shirt as t-shirt.

130
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,770
Give him another shirt.

131
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,310
Reddy, you kept it ready, is it ready made.

132
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,270
No, it is Reddy made!
I stitched it.

133
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,100
Go, change it.
Okay.

134
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,730
Go...

135
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,810
Idiot made it ugly.

136
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,206
It is fitted, as if you stitched it for me.

137
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,996
It will like that...
when the time is in worst.

138
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,126
He is telling that, everything will
be fitted, if your time is good.

139
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,400
Oh...!

140
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,900
Veerababu..

141
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,326
What happened, why you are tensed?

142
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,020
One among the 25 grooms is escaped.

143
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,020
Escaped? Who is that?

144
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,900
One who is brought for Pushpa!

145
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,690
Oh God, MLA will get Heart Attack,
if he come to know about it.

146
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,916
That means he'll not come for my marriage.

147
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,690
Stop it, dude.

148
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,690
Veerababu, we left with only 10 minutes.

149
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,100
I am doing adoration, otherwise
I would have act as groom.

150
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,650
Can anyone of you act, please?

151
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,376
My wife will die, if she comes to know about it.
My wife will kill me if she comes to know about it.

152
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,940
Friend is not the one who is shares bikes back
seat, one who pushes it when it is punctured.

153
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,940
Is he really asking you to get married,
is just asking you to act as groom.

154
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,600
Are they really your friends?

155
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,940
Cool dude.

156
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,520
Why don' you act, instead of telling us.

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,150
Hey, next month is my marriage.

158
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,770
That's why, you will be practiced.

159
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,690
Hey don't force him.

160
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,350
Veerababu, I agree to act as a bride,
but you failed to get a groom for me.

161
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,690
I am trying, Pushpa.

162
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,690
Listen, I will take bed and
cot from MLA's marriage gifts.

163
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,310
You can give gold ring to
the groom who agreed to act.

164
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,770
I don't mind.

165
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,706
Dude, will they give a gold ring for those
who are getting married here?

166
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,100
Yes, they will give.

167
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,390
But, I could not get the one
who is willing to take it.

168
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,900
If, I agree immediately
I will lose my image.

169
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,730
If not immediately, you lose ring.

170
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,100
Do you know what a China's
poet said about friendship?

171
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,850
What he said?

172
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,980
You can't understand as he
said in Chinese language.

173
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,270
Ok dude, for your sake I
agree to act as a groom.

174
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,600
Hey, you saved MLA's life.
I want him to come for my marriage.

175
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,440
You are my best friend.
Same to you.

176
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,980
You understand it right, I did it
for relationship not for this ring.

177
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,480
See Ms. Pushpa.

178
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,730
You should get away from here as soon as
you become Mrs. Pushpa.

179
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,456
After that,
we both are nothing to each other.

180
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,060
Don't think as if you are Prabhas.

181
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,650
Why do I marry you if I am Prabhas?

182
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,810
Ok, Minister will come anytime, let's go.

183
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,310
(JANAKIRAM, LONG LIVE.)

184
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,190
(GOVARDHAN, LONG LIVE.)

185
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,730
(JANAKIRAM, LONG LIVE.)

186
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,100
(GOVARDHAN, LONG LIVE.)

187
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,520
Greetings!
Sir, bouquet.

188
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,060
Please come sir.

189
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,150
Hey, move away.

190
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,600
Greetings! How are you all?

191
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,560
Hey, move away.
Move away.

192
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,350
Greetings..
Come Mr Langa Bangaru Babu.

193
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,060
How are you?

194
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,270
Sir, my name is Lanka Bangaru Babu.

195
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,730
Let it be.

196
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Hey, jacket.

197
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,600
You both should work together as jacket
and skirt for the party.

198
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,350
Sure.
Ok?

199
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Sure, sir.

200
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,150
There will be always gap between jacket
and skirt, they will not come together.

201
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,980
Yes, I am on top and you are at bottom.

202
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Hey...

203
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,770
Greetings...

204
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,980
Greetings, minister.
Hey Pushpa, how are you?

205
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,350
Minister still remember me!

206
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,060
How can I forget, Pushpa?

207
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,230
God, she knows everybody.

208
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Greetings to everybody!

209
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:24,060
I welcome honorable minister Govardhan
for this event on behalf of Mr Jacket.

210
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,400
So many people are trying to damage Mr
jacket's image in the party and in public.

211
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,770
Yes, you are right.

212
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,980
We will not let them to do
it until we are with him.

213
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,400
Sorry brother,
I slipped as I am on high dose.

214
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,020
In this situation, I will slip my hand.

215
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,980
Henceforth, instead of 25 pairs
he will make it to 125 pairs.

216
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Is my smile ok?

217
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,060
See how I do it.

218
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,350
That's why...

219
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,480
Brother, they are exactly 25 pairs here.

220
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,730
Veerababu has overcome our plan,
and saved Jacket's dignity.

221
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:14,810
He sincerely grown up from the stage
of stitching jackets to the MLA Janakiram.

222
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,900
No doubt, he will become a Minister
next to me.

223
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,100
It's all your mercy.

224
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,350
Till date used to tell that you
are his son or brother in law.

225
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,150
But now he is telling that Jacket
is his political successor.

226
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,440
May be he is a political successor,
but I am for his wealth.

227
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,940
(CHANTS...)

228
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,690
(BLESSINGS...)

229
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:44,980
Greetings, sir.

230
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,060
Greetings.
Greetings.

231
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Come on, Tie a knot...

232
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,940
Hey... do it.

233
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,180
Hello... please you help her.

234
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,690
Hey not you, I should tie.

235
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,900
I will tie it.

236
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,020
You should not tie it to me.

237
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,560
(BLESSINGS...)

238
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,440
In a hurry I tied three knots.

239
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
You idiot, drinker.

240
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,150
Wait, I did not tie the Rakhi yet.

241
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,560
(SONG HUMMING...)

242
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,440
Hey, I will surprise my
Krishnaveni showing this ring.

243
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,850
Before that, cheers.

244
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,310
Cheers.

245
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,600
Hey dude, you forgot that you are
on adoration and drinking alcohol.

246
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,650
I was doing it to make 25 marriages,
I did it, so I finished it.

247
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,850
So, you involved me to escape on yourself.

248
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,730
No dude.
It's ok, I will leave you for this ring.

249
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,190
That's why, you are trapped.

250
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,100
If you ask me to marry anybody on the
road, I will do it.

251
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,270
But, that girl is great, she left a golden
ring for me and took bed and cot with her.

252
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,520
She is like a gold who doesn't care gold.

253
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,230
Hey, somebody clicked gold's photo.

254
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
Yes dude.

255
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,850
When did you both acted for advertisement?

256
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,480
This is not ad, it's my bad.

257
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,400
What should I answer to my Krishnaveni.

258
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,650
I want to kill who clicked this photo.

259
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,310
Why dude, he captured it very nice.

260
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,650
He took off my dignity.

261
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,060
Take the call.

262
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:21,650
Hello...

263
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,310
Why did you marry a public figure like
Pushpa, instead of a decent Krishnaveni.

264
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,560
I tempted for the gold.

265
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,440
By the way how did you know
that her name is Pushpa.

266
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,810
Not just me, entire state knows about her.

267
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,850
She is a famous recording dancer.

268
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,480
Recording dancer?

269
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:47,310
(BACHELOR BOY BE WITH ME YOU
WILL BECOME A BEST HUSBAND.)

270
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:57,600
In addition to that, her mother,
grandmother all is having group visa.

271
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,230
They even go for the foreign tours.

272
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,650
Because of you we lost our
dignity in India and Overseas too.

273
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,230
Stop it.

274
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,190
It's just a dummy marriage.

275
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,560
Don't discuss this topic
with Krishnaveni's father.

276
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,400
I got to know this from him.

277
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,440
How did he know?

278
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,600
It is a breaking news in TV.

279
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,850
Breaking news?

280
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,350
Are they using me too?

281
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,600
Oh God!

282
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,560
Hey, they would give 10 acres land
as a dowry if I marry Krishnaveni.

283
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,400
Now I lost both Krishnaveni and land too.

284
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,190
Stop it dude.

285
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,706
Tomorrow, will go to Krishnaveni's house,
explain what happened.

286
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,350
Why till tomorrow, let's go now itself.

287
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,100
Everybody got to know
about my marriage, is it?

288
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,480
You are telling on yourself.
Shut up and come.

289
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
What happened Dasu.

290
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,770
Car is not getting started.

291
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,190
Come let's help him.

292
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,350
It's my life matter there is it required now?
Shut up and come.

293
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,650
This side Veerababu.

294
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,770
You be there.

295
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,690
Do it properly.

296
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,770
Hey, what are you doing?

297
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,100
We are pushing the car.

298
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,980
You...

299
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,626
Are doing it as if you are trying for kids
after you are operated for family planning.

300
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,076
You do like this, if you are over drunk.
Push it from the back side.

301
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Push it.

302
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,600
What are you pushing at?

303
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,650
I am pushing the car brother.

304
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,310
I am so tired of pushing the car.

305
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,100
You are not pushing the car
you are pushing the air.

306
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,230
Push it properly.

307
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,060
Brother, you are Pushpa's
husband, am I right?

308
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,480
Hey...

309
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,100
How could he recognise me that
I am Pushpa's husband, even after drunk?

310
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,650
Is that Minister post?

311
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,400
It is more than that, you just push it.

312
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,810
My fate!

313
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,650
Brother.
What?

314
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,600
Don't hurt Pushpa at any time.

315
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,850
If she gets hurt, will you commit suicide,
I will kill you before that.

316
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Stop it.
No brother.

317
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,310
If you are prisoned killing
me, Pushpa will become lonely.

318
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,560
He is making her to his own.

319
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,730
Hey, come on Push.

320
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,400
I can't handle his torture ask
him to leave or I will leave.

321
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:12,900
Hey wait.

322
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,190
Suribabu.
You push it.

323
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,860
Brother, what is that
sound from the boot space?

324
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,900
Nothing. The gas cylinders.

325
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,190
Please push it.

326
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,900
Silence.

327
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,600
Why is he telling silence
to the gas cylinder?

328
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,480
Let's open it and see.
Nothing is there.

329
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,190
Who are you?

330
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,400
Why are you playing in the car at midnight?

331
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Oh no...

332
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,190
Oh no...

333
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,810
She is beating Pushpa's
husband, let's see her end.

334
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,850
How dare you beat Pushpa's husband.

335
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,230
Hey, what?
What?

336
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,350
You are a girl, otherwise.

337
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,020
Otherwise!

338
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,060
Oh no..

339
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,810
How can you break a boy's hand?

340
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,100
I curse you that you
will not get a baby boy.

341
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,150
Hey..

342
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,730
Oh God, it's my mistake please leave me.

343
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,650
Hey wait.

344
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,020
Veerababu!

345
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,940
She broke your hand.

346
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,190
Hey, Suri...

347
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,310
I cannot turn my neck and
my hand is also not working.

348
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,310
You are making us to push a car,
where you are taking a girl to rape her.

349
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,020
I can't do anything today,
how could I do rape!?

350
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,650
By the way, who is she?

351
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,480
She is the daughter of Mangamma
who started a hotel near to church.

352
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,600
She is trying for a police job, it seems.

353
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,650
Still trying?

354
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,286
She is behaving like as
if she is real police.

355
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:04,230
We are playing cards in the night,
as children will be there at daytime.

356
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,310
Is it wrong?

357
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,960
Not as much as playing in the daytime.

358
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,350
Then why did she beat us?

359
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,206
We are all together could catch her
and place her in the boot space of the car.

360
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,376
And planned to push it from the hill.

361
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,810
In between we came and allowed
to escape the devil, is it?

362
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,600
Yes.

363
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,270
Suribabu, check the phone call.

364
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
Please check.

365
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,900
Tell me dude.

366
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,190
It's not me somebody Photoshop it.
Please listen me.

367
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,230
Who is that?

368
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,020
It is Balu from Delhi.

369
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,060
Oh..so what...?

370
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,230
They posted my marriage photo on Facebook.

371
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,270
Got 10000 likes in 10 minutes.

372
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,480
It seems, he is very happy.

373
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,940
Oh God, 10000 likes in just 10 minutes!

374
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,270
Congratulations.

375
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,310
My fate!

376
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,940
Come out.

377
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,900
Come...

378
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,480
Move...

379
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,190
Come out.

380
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,350
Everybody, wait.

381
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,650
Dude, you call them.

382
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,900
'Ammaaaa'

383
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,650
Hey, seems beggars have come,
give them left over food.

384
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,310
What, are you guys roaming
in autos for begging?

385
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,666
What, are you guys roaming
in autos for begging?

386
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,190
You know, we are left and right for MLA.

387
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,400
Hands!

388
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,240
Your daughter broke our
right and left hands.

389
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,350
Why did you come to hotel?
Go to the hospital.

390
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,270
Doctor said, this case should be treated
by the one who broke it.

391
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,230
Oh girl...

392
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,230
She looks different form yesterday!

393
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
So much variation!

394
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,850
Mom, who are they?

395
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,600
What is happening?

396
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,850
What are you looking at, don't you
remember, last night while kidnapping you?

397
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,940
How dare you to kidnap me.

398
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,900
My hand will come out completely,
we are not kidnapers, we saved you.

399
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:43,770
Sorry,

400
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,826
I thought you both are
kidnapers, in the dark.

401
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,036
Is it enough to say sorry,
for what you have done for us.

402
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,480
Hey, she apologies, leave it.
Move aside.

403
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,780
Its not your mistake, anyone in your
place would do same way as you did.

404
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,150
That's why, I will give your sorry back.

405
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,350
I am sorry.

406
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,690
What? Is it painful?

407
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,560
Subbu, bring some oil.

408
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,900
Come.

409
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,400
Let's go, we shall to go a massage parlor.

410
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
Come on... move.

411
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,400
Girl, your cheeks are making me crave,
as if they are tasty food.

412
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,100
My heart expands as a Puri.

413
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:31,350
When you rotating your belly as Chapati,
made my breath boils like Upma.

414
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,480
Your looks like Minapavada,
made my heart beats heavy.

415
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,100
Your curves like Uthappa,
are made me to swing.

416
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,020
Let's love each other life
long, as Sambar Idli.

417
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,060
Girl!

418
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,980
Oh girl!

419
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,230
Girl, your cheeks are making me crave,
as if they are tasty food.

420
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,190
My heart expands as a Puri.

421
00:22:53,650 --> 00:23:00,690
When you rotating your belly as Chapati,
made my breath boils like Upma.

422
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:30,060
If you are police like pepper in Pongal,
I am politician like chilly in Bajji.

423
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,770
You should arrest goons with Wada...

424
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,190
I should grow like Modi,
who became leader by selling Tea.

425
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,230
Like coffee powder and milk mingles,
we both should mingle.

426
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,900
Like potato and Paratha, law
and order should run.

427
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,730
We should be like, mixed rice and curd.

428
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,020
Girl!

429
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,810
Oh girl!

430
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,190
Girl, your cheeks are making me crave,
as if they are tasty food.

431
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,190
My heart expands as a Puri.

432
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,190
Everybody...

433
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,060
Just shake it baby...

434
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,560
Oh come on baby...

435
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,150
I will write wedding invitation on
Pulka, which you make.

436
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,810
I will make a marriage flexi with
a paper Dosa, which you prepare.

437
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,520
I will treat the lemon rice as
blessing, which you prepared.

438
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,940
I will tie them all Punuku,
and put around your neck.

439
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,060
Yellow in the egg is Thali,

440
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,730
I will tie Maggi noodles
like a yellow thread.

441
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,770
Be with me,
we will be like Pesarattu and Upma.

442
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:46,810
Oh girl!

443
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,650
Oh girl!

444
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:53,060
Girl, your cheeks are making me crave,
as if they are tasty food.

445
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,810
My heart expands as a Puri.

446
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:03,440
When you rotating your belly as Chapati,
made my breath boils like Upma.

447
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,270
Please, please Krishnaveni.

448
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,246
Please listen to me, that's not the actual marriage,
that's a drama marriage which I did for my friend.

449
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,100
Don't you trust me?

450
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,480
Alright, I will trust you.

451
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,876
But, this society should trust you.

452
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,900
After our marriage, what if she comes again
and fight for you?

453
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,230
She won't,
she will be busy with all people.

454
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,310
What if she comes.

455
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,400
I can't handle her for life long.

456
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,770
Get divorce papers, saying that you
and Pushpa are separated.

457
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,850
After that, we will marry each other.

458
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,746
Otherwise, will you stay
like this for entire life?

459
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:55,100
No ways, I will marry my
brother in-law Ramakrishna.

460
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,690
Hey, Krishnaveni.

461
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,060
I will come with divorce papers and I will
give first wedding card to Ramakrishna.

462
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,060
Like Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma,
Veerababu and Vasanthi.

463
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
How is the combination?

464
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,060
What? Vasanthi!

465
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,326
You both are not for each other.

466
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,536
We both are made for each other

467
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,900
I will become MLA,
once Mr. Jacket becomes minister.

468
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,690
Police and politician, is there any
best combination than this?

469
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,190
Mine and Pushpa's!

470
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,600
I am supposed to roam to distribute wedding cards,
but you made me to hold these divorce papers.

471
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,286
And, you are planning
for your own marriage.

472
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,456
What are those divorce papers?

473
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,600
I met Krishnaveni at temple
and explained everything.

474
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:34,520
She said, get divorce from Pushpa,
otherwise we can't marry each other.

475
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,310
Somehow, you speak with MLA and
get these papers signed by Pushpa, please.

476
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,690
Ok, I will speak with MLA.
You come along with Pushpa.

477
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,730
Thanks.

478
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,020
What are you talking?

479
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,666
I have seen her first and last
time at marriage event itself.

480
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,250
Or else, call her and ask where she is.

481
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,730
I would I know her contact number?

482
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,940
Don't you know your wife's contact number?

483
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,350
My wife!

484
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,270
Is she my wife?
Hey, stop it.

485
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,850
You made to marry her and
now asking like this, idiots.

486
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,190
I will kill you all.

487
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,350
How do I get her number, now?

488
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,020
8790241948.

489
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,480
How do you know her contact number?

490
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,940
Am asking you, answer me.

491
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,440
Hey wait, is that important now?

492
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,350
First, call her.

493
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,810
It has a meaning if a college going guy
has her number, but he also got her number.

494
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,650
Tell me!

495
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,310
879...

496
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,940
8.. 7.. 9...

497
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,060
0.. 2...

498
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,940
02...

499
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,270
41...

500
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,400
4.. 1...

501
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
94...

502
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,520
9.. 4...

503
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,980
8...

504
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,400
The subscriber you have called
is busy with other customer.

505
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,100
Please wait on line.

506
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,310
Busy with customers!
Confirmed, it is her number.

507
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,480
God, bless to start the
day with good business.

508
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Hey, come.

509
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:16,650
(BANTHI AND VASANTHI KISSES!)

510
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:22,060
(BANTHI AND VASANTHI KISSES!)

511
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,310
Subbu, look at there.

512
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,480
(BANTHI AND VASANTHI KISSES!)

513
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,400
That's not Vasanthi, Chamomile.

514
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,850
What items you have?

515
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,690
Idli is ready.
No, Dosa?

516
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,126
It will take half an hour.
I don't want.

517
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,730
Chilli bajji?

518
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,060
We prepare them in the evening.

519
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,230
Then, we want them, we will wait till then.

520
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,350
Till the evening?

521
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,956
Meanwhile, get something to
drink, at least.

522
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,020
Hey what is that you have
hot, tea or coffee?

523
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:43,940
My sister is hot!

524
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,650
Is it?

525
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,230
I am feeling so chill ask
her to come and hug me.

526
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,230
Seems, they have not come to have anything.

527
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
What happened, dear?

528
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,350
I can't tolerate their torture.

529
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,600
Wait dear, you want to become police.

530
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:58,996
It will be difficult,
if any case is filed against you.

531
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,310
Give this money at Giri's shop.

532
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,190
You go, I will take care of them.

533
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,060
Hey, aunty is coming, somehow manage her.

534
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,020
What is this, not fair what you are doing.

535
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
One minute, aunty.

536
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,650
He called at right time.

537
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,600
Hello...

538
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,190
I got an information about Pushpa.

539
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,190
She did a program at Bellary, last night.

540
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,230
Oh you!

541
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,310
You are posted at Bellary?

542
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,850
What is posting!
There are posters of her everywhere.

543
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,270
Police job, is it?

544
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,940
By the way, is Bellary belongs
to Karnataka government?

545
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,520
Yes, do you think it is
under Canada government.

546
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,940
Don't worry, I will recommend
you to transfer to Telangana state.

547
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,520
If require,
I will ask our MLA to speak with DGP.

548
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,666
Hey what is the topic I am speaking
and what you are answering for?

549
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,690
Okay...?

550
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,770
Shit, it's like one-way
traffic to speak with him.

551
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,480
Sorry aunty, you are saying something else.
Nothing.

552
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,230
I want to speak with you
personally, please come inside.

553
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:54,900
Sure.
Come.

554
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,980
My mother in law is calling me, I will go.

555
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,020
Listen, it's a dream for my
daughter to become police.

556
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,310
You have good contacts with MLA, right.
Take these 10 lacs and give her a job.

557
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Money is not required aunty,
I can do it for Vasanti.

558
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,900
No, just a recommendation is not enough.

559
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,690
Money has to be transferred.

560
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,230
She wanted to get a job on her merit.

561
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,770
A year is passed,
to realize that merit is not just enough.

562
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,810
Please take it.

563
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,230
Don't let her know about this.

564
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,850
She doesn't like to give bribe.

565
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,190
Sure, aunty.

566
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,900
We should monitor for minimum 48 hours.

567
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,600
After that?

568
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,020
Should keep in ice box!

569
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,520
Condition critical.

570
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,150
It's great that he lived so
long, for his lifestyle.

571
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,650
Your Thali is so strong!

572
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,020
Yes doctor, it is made of 12 grams.

573
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,650
So thick!

574
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,690
Sister, did brother in law speak anything?

575
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,100
How dare he to speak in front of me?

576
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:12,060
You fool, did he speak
anything about 500 crores.

577
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,440
No, but he asked to call
Mr. Jacket Janakiram.

578
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,060
Oh that guy...!

579
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,650
Why?

580
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,230
Maybe to stitch new jackets for me.

581
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,560
Oh! You...

582
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,326
when I am thinking about crores
and you are thinking about jackets.

583
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,020
Brother... something is happening
between crores and jackets.

584
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,770
Correct Abhijeet.

585
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Something wrong.

586
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,190
Om cream ice cream!

587
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,190
Om cream face cream!

588
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,900
He is saying ice cream and face
cream, is he really Baba?

589
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,400
Shut up he is really powerful.

590
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,980
He will show you missing people or missing
things, by sketching on betel leaves.

591
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,650
Oh...!

592
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,810
Oh, leaves search as of Google search?

593
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:01,600
Whose name has a power
to make an older person active!

594
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,730
Even a baby boy will play with ecstasy!

595
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,440
The same form is coming by cat walking!

596
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,850
God, all these are Pushpa's qualities.

597
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,150
36... 26... 36!

598
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,270
Uncle, why is he telling measurements?

599
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,350
Not measurements, they are sizes!

600
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,126
That's what, why you are checking
sizes instead of to finding the person?

601
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,980
Sir, can I see it once?

602
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Just once.

603
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,850
Baba, you are not an ordinary
one you are glorious.

604
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,020
I feel like I am saying Pushpa directly.

605
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,310
She wore a green color saree.

606
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,440
She must have worn a
black color blouse too.

607
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,190
How did you know without saying on leaf?

608
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,270
See straight, you will be shocked.

609
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,520
2000 to show a person on leaf.

610
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,980
5000 if I bring the
person directly to home.

611
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,940
Give 5000 to baba and go.

612
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,350
I could not find you anywhere in
India, where were you?

613
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,440
I went to Kashi to vanish my all sins.

614
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,940
My image is damaged with this marriage.

615
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,310
Rest of the life is with you.

616
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,020
With me?

617
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,350
When I ask you to act,
why did you do it in real?

618
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,940
Pushpa, where do I keep this bed?

619
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,810
Inside my bedroom.
Okay.

620
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,690
Our bedroom?

621
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,770
What is your scheme?

622
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,650
Don't you understand, along with the ring
this bed and cot are also for you.

623
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,770
Father-in-law, please bless me.

624
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,770
Stay happy, dear.

625
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,230
Anyway, she will be happy.

626
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:28,690
It's me who should roam
around and do recording dance.

627
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,560
Why are you supporting her?
Please go inside.

628
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,690
OK, your wish.

629
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,060
Where are you going?
My house.

630
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
Your house?

631
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,020
Are you blackmailing me?

632
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,940
You are not my wife, just sign
on the divorce papers and get out.

633
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,190
You said I am not your
wife, why should I sign?

634
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,376
Brother in law,
where should I keep the bed?

635
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,270
Keep it in your back!

636
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,350
Keep it in your back!

637
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,940
I will give you money if you want,
just sign on these papers.

638
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,770
Why should I go?

639
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,650
We are not married in
secret, we married in public.

640
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,150
If you want, ask our MLA to tell me.

641
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,940
Oh, you are coming in this route?

642
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,940
Wait, right now I'll bring our MLA here
and make you sign on these papers.

643
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,480
First you bring MLA
here, we will see later.

644
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,190
You stay here,
I'll bring him in just 10 minutes.

645
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,270
Don't go inside.

646
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,650
Dear, please bring rice while
coming, I need to cook.

647
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,730
I will cook you!

648
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,520
Good morning, brother.

649
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,060
Veerababu, come in.

650
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,730
Have breakfast.

651
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,326
No, thank you sister in law.
I just had.

652
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,400
He is trying for a hotel owner's daughter.

653
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,810
He might have had in full.

654
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,560
Hey, is it true?

655
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,956
Nothing like that sister-in-law,
brother is just joking.

656
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:38,520
Then why are you spending much time in hotel rather
than in tailor shop or in Party office? Ask him.

657
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,690
What are you waiting for?
Ask them to come, we will speak.

658
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,770
Minister sir is in serious
condition, need to go to hospital.

659
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,020
Keep my files in the car.

660
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,650
Brother.
Yes.

661
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,940
Take this. What is this?

662
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,060
Money, 10 lacs.

663
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,600
10 lacs, What for?

664
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,850
My lover's mother has given
this amount to post her SI job.

665
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,850
I have taken money to stitch jackets.

666
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,520
But, never to help people.

667
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,310
I know you will not take.
But you may need to give this to others.

668
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,600
Moreover, it's a police job.

669
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,440
Please brother, for my sake.

670
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,270
Ok ok.

671
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:15,350
Anyway, I am going to town, I will meet
DGP Sadasivam, and I will speak about this.

672
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Greetings...

673
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,900
Brother!
Hey, Suri!

674
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,310
Why are you tensed?

675
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,060
Brother, please come with me.
Where?

676
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,350
Pushpa has come to my home,
I should live with her it seems.

677
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,440
Wife and husband should live together.

678
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,850
She is not my wife.

679
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,310
Other day, I pretended to be her husband,
to save your dignity.

680
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,150
He told you, didn't he?

681
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,230
What is this?

682
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,350
I will not do anything without telling you.

683
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,690
Try to remember it.

684
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:45,440
Early morning 5:00 a.m., cock has crowd.

685
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,980
What is he telling about,
when I am asking about marriage?

686
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,850
Hey, you wait.

687
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,310
I know how to remind him.

688
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,810
Brother, we did not do
25 marriages that day.

689
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,600
Why not, we have given all the gifts
like ring, bed and cot to each couple.

690
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,100
Nobody is escaped from there.

691
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,100
Why not, you brought them back.

692
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,706
Yes, I am the one among them.

693
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,350
Minister has not come to the function.

694
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,770
Why not, he came and greeted Pushpa
who is standing beside him.

695
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:14,020
Same Pushpa is asking me to live together.

696
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,060
How is it possible, it's wrong!

697
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,456
Now. You could understand it.

698
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,020
I will get out of this problem, if you come
and make her sign on these divorce papers.

699
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,400
Let's go.
Brother, wait.

700
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,270
Minister's condition is serious it seems.
He need to go on urgent.

701
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,840
There is another important work too.

702
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,940
Hey Suri, I will do your work after coming.

703
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,690
Just give me 5 minutes,
my house is on the way.

704
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,440
You're getting late, please get in.

705
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,980
Brother just 5 minutes, please.

706
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,600
Let's go.
Brother please.

707
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,230
Leave him, let him go. Brother.

708
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,060
Brother... don't forget about my work.

709
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:49,230
I got to understand that, we should not
trust the one who is behind the politician.

710
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,850
Dude, I can understand your
feelings, cool down.

711
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,626
All of you come to the party office.

712
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,650
Okay.

713
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,690
Greetings...

714
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:00,850
Where is minister?

715
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,980
In gym!

716
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,810
Is this time for kidding?

717
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:07,900
You are kidding, do you think it is an
IMAX theatre, club or pub?

718
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,100
He is there in ICU.

719
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,190
Okay.

720
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,270
Hey brother.

721
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,400
You should tell me whatever
my brother in law tells you, inside.

722
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,650
This is not comedy I am serious.

723
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,980
Sure.
Thank you.

724
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Hey..
Brother..

725
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:29,600
Brother in law's beard is grown up
we will shave it after he becomes fine.

726
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:30,850
Ok sir.
Brother in law.

727
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,100
See who has come.

728
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,650
It's me Jacket.
Mr. Jacket.

729
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,600
Should I come there,
tell me now brother in law.

730
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,350
Tell me.

731
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,650
Oh God, I am here nothing
will happen to you.

732
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:51,940
I am like dying, first you take out
your legs from the oxygen pipe.

733
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,850
Oh God, I am sorry.
Idiot.

734
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,060
Oh God, I am sorry.

735
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,810
Go out.
I am going out.

736
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,650
Brother, do you remember what I told you.

737
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,850
Yes.
Thank you.

738
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:12,190
I brought him up as I don't have children.
Now he become threat to me.

739
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,190
Hey.. Move.

740
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:24,100
So far, I could earn money and respect,
but I couldn't earn the dignity.

741
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,730
Entire world knows about this,
did you call me to say this?

742
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,310
Not about that.

743
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,440
Those 500 crores...

744
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,230
Oh no...

745
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,900
Who is that?

746
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:42,020
It's me, I came to check the oxygen supply.

747
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,940
Idiot, get out.

748
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,310
Come out!

749
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,020
You hide those 500 crores there?

750
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,900
Transfer that amount to your
account and use it for good being.

751
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,850
Let me gain some dignity too.
Sure sir.

752
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Don't discuss with that idiot.

753
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,020
See you Sir.

754
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,730
Why did he beat you being a brother in law?

755
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,810
Brother, Yes.

756
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,850
Why Mr. Langa is coming here?

757
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,100
It seems, he is telling about money
to all the public, instead of us.

758
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,980
Greetings sir.

759
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,100
Why did Minister call Mr. Jacket?

760
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:32,560
He is calling every one of
you to tell about 500 crores.

761
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,980
Hey, stop kidding.

762
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,400
Hey, Abhijeet.
Yes, brother.

763
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,400
First time in my life I told him the truth.

764
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,706
But, why does he not believe it?

765
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,536
Henceforth don't tell
the truth for entire life

766
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,080
I will not tell it for any of my life.

767
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
Sir.

768
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,270
Where is Mr. Jacket.
I don't know.

769
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,900
Where he hides himself?

770
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,020
Mr. Jacket.

771
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,850
Don't call that name I
am getting irritated.

772
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,850
We too, getting irritated.

773
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,270
Hey Abhijeet, he looks like an elephant,
how can he escape from this room?

774
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,600
He cheated us.

775
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,940
The word cheating is very
famous in this state.

776
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,350
He is also a cheat. Let's find him.
Okay brother.

777
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,480
Mr Langa, see you.

778
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:13,190
Oh my god, he is escaping. Yes.

779
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,150
Let's go.

780
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,650
Start the vehicle.

781
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,690
Look, I started rowdyism at the age of 10.

782
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,770
I developed in politics by the age of 25.

783
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,850
Not looking at my service but they gave me a
party ticket looking at the murders I did.

784
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,980
That Minister post should come only to me.

785
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,810
I'll kill even if you come in my way
and this is the final warning.

786
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,270
Brother, Doctor is coming.

787
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,060
Sorry, he is no more.

788
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,860
Have you given a warning
to dead body till now?

789
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,230
I didn't expect he died.

790
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,600
If you murdering with talks,
is into the CC cameras, we will die.

791
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,480
Come on, let's escape.

792
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,560
Come on, move.

793
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,150
There, he's going...

794
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,770
We too are going, right bro?

795
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,560
Take right... Take right...

796
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,690
He's going. He's going.
Come on, I'm going bro.

797
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,650
Hey Abhijeet,
I'll feed you a good Bawarchi Biryani.

798
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,230
Where are you going this way?

799
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,536
You said Bawarchi Biryani, right?

800
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,576
You idiot, after the work is done and after
we catch him and then is the Biryani.

801
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,150
Turn back.
I'm turning bro.

802
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,190
Move on.

803
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,810
Go... Go... Go on dude.

804
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,650
Take a turn... Turn the way he turns.

805
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,650
Hey, he's crossing the bridge on the river.

806
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,400
Oh no...

807
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,841
Oh no, vehicle turned upside down.
Has he died by mistake?

808
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,980
Oh God, no moment in the legs.
You think, he's alive.

809
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,310
Bro, it was you killing
mercilessly by saying chasing.

810
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,940
Is it to make an accident,
when I said to go fast?

811
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,100
If he dies, it's like we too are dead.

812
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,190
Oh Goddess, you shall save us.
Oh God, he should be alive

813
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,770
(LIVE MY DEAR,
YOU LIVE LIFELONG FOR HUNDRED YEARS...)

814
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,520
Oh God, is he breathing from the nose?

815
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,730
Hey, he's breathing.
Hail Mysamma Goddess.

816
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:28,810
Hey. My 500 crores are alive. Bring the vehicle
and we shall take him to the hospital.

817
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,020
Oh no Veerababu, what's all this?
Please Control sister in law.

818
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,826
Be with courage and nothing
will happen to brother.

819
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,900
Oh God...!

820
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,900
See Veerababu, even those not taking
money to vote are also crying means...

821
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,900
It's definitely...
Please control sister in law.

822
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,850
Hey, why's he gone even without
finishing his 5 year term?

823
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,730
Stop it man, it's not the MLA sir who died.

824
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,230
You continue madam.

825
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,900
It's not brother. Take him on.

826
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,560
How's brother Sir?

827
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,350
MLA sir is into Coma getting
a strong wound to his head.

828
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:58,480
Oh God, it's my bad luck.

829
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,730
A man not knowing even to put Allout for mosquitoes
but just knows to stitch blouses is gone into Coma...

830
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,956
Don't cry madam, we started the treatment and there's a
chance that he'd come back to consciousness in 10 days.

831
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,996
What if he doesn't come back?

832
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,350
I'll not take back my word
and say 10 days even then.

833
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,690
You go and visit him.

834
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:13,810
Go sister in law.

835
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:18,650
MLA Sir, how long would it take for MLA
Sir to come back into senses?

836
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,230
Is there no any discount?

837
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:23,230
This isn't any sari to give season discount
but it's his blouse.

838
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:28,810
Let even crores be spent but MLA Sir should be back
to senses, go to the Assembly and say Speaker Sir...

839
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,520
No problem even if 499 crores are spent.

840
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,230
That is brother, not even
a crore is left behind if he dies and...

841
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,190
Come on, we shall go that way.

842
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:39,850
Hey, I'd have settled the matter
if he had come with me for five minutes.

843
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,820
You said we shall look into after he comes.

844
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,286
But the situation now is like we shall
look at him when he's out from Coma.

845
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:46,150
Hey, he'd come out fast
and it's my guarantee.

846
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:50,690
No idea when he's back from Coma and when
he'd make Pushpa sign these divorce papers...

847
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:51,810
Damn!

848
00:43:53,690 --> 00:44:00,600
As Jacket Jagannatham, MLA of Satynarayanapuram met with
a dreaded road accident, he's admitted to KIMS hospital.

849
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,440
Oh no, accident of MLA?

850
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,850
It's like I lost 10 Lakhs.
What's happened mom?

851
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,520
Give these 10 Lakhs and get her a job Sir.

852
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,150
Do you have any sense, idiot?

853
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,076
Where were you when brother
was driving the car?

854
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,350
I'd been to drink water bro.

855
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,416
How long would you drink water?

856
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,376
I got late by the time I
mix a quarter and drank.

857
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,020
Wow, what a duty minded...

858
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,190
Get out rascal.

859
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,190
Veerababu...

860
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,730
What, have you come to meet MLA Sir?

861
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,150
No, we came to get BP checked.

862
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,786
Do you have BP in such tender age?

863
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,650
Won't we get a BP losing 10 Lakhs?

864
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,100
That is... I said it getting
a BP listening out accident.

865
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,810
I don't like to get a job by bribing.

866
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:40,210
We don't have a facility to
get a bribe after getting jobs.

867
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,440
Give our money back.

868
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,690
What, do I look like any comedy villain?

869
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,730
Your mom pleaded and put
that money in my hands.

870
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,520
I went and gave it to that MLA
and MLA handed that to DGP Sadasivam.

871
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:53,166
Maybe money changing banks would come into hands,
but money changing hands would never come back

872
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,190
I won't believe you

873
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,650
I'm a loyal man and check by
Googling if you wish to...

874
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,250
I'll make that Sadasivam say
if you still have doubts, come on.

875
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,690
What dude, a new problem?

876
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,230
Old one but started newly again.

877
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,036
These aren't believing then I said to have
give money to Sadasivam for a Police job.

878
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,876
That's why taking these
to make him say the truth.

879
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,690
Why these to Sadasivam? He's coming here
at 10 in the morning to meet MLA Sir.

880
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,060
Heard right, come tomorrow.

881
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,230
If he says not to have taken me,
hit me on the spot with your slippers.

882
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:15,810
Okay.

883
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,956
Ok, we will come tomorrow morning.
I'll bring a bag too while coming.

884
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,650
Not a bag but get a large bag.

885
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:21,126
Maybe he'd return with interest. Move dear.

886
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,100
Thanks dude, you proved that real friend
is the one saving in trouble.

887
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:27,246
Thanks to you too. You proved real friend
is that drowning down when in troubles.

888
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,730
Ok, leave that topic now.

889
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,730
Ok dude, how do you know that
DGP Sadasivam is coming to meet MLA?

890
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,650
DGP Sadasivam, who's that fellow?

891
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:34,900
Hey, you just said right?

892
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,810
Hey, I said about that
snack vendor Sadasivam.

893
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,480
It seems, he'd come tomorrow
in the morning to feed MLA.

894
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,730
That guy? I heard you and have said her that DGP
Sadasivam is coming tomorrow morning, right?

895
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,150
Leave it, you escaped today right?

896
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:48,496
She said to hit me with slipper
if he doesn't come tomorrow.

897
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,576
Go in the night and steal her slippers.

898
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,240
Then she'd buy new slippers and then hit.

899
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,190
Let's do one thing, we'll go meet that DGP
Sadasivam and ask him to come here tomorrow.

900
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:58,690
Hey, you come to my house
and offer me a bribe, rascal?

901
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,076
Total magazine will enter your
body if I press the trigger.

902
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,020
Sorry Sir leave me. I made a mistake Sir.

903
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,900
You're saved as I'm in uniform, get lost.

904
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,900
Hello watchman, is DGP Sir inside?
Go guys.

905
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,940
Hey, why's he so much frightened?

906
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,746
It's DGP right,
he would have used him up well.

907
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,770
Hey, we don't need to fear like him.
We're the men of MLA Sir.

908
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:21,310
We shall be strong and added
he's taken money from us.

909
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,100
Look dude, I'll dash in
getting a narrow space. Come on.

910
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,270
Sada... Sada...

911
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,560
Dude Sada...

912
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:30,810
House is quite big.

913
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,230
He is taking 10 lakhs per post
and it'd be at least so big.

914
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,190
Hi Sada, how are you I'm Good

915
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,310
I'm just average.

916
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,940
There are so many shields.
Did you rob all these and did you win?

917
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:44,270
Hey, so many are for sale
in the market for 500.

918
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,730
Yes, just for fun dude.

919
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,900
May I know who you are?

920
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,650
Can we sit there and talk?

921
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,190
I'm right and he's left for MLA Jacket.

922
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,230
Hands.

923
00:46:59,270 --> 00:46:59,900
Oh...!

924
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,100
You know that MLA met with an accident
and is admitted in the hospital, right?

925
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:07,150
He gave you 10 lakhs for the post of
SI, right? We came to talk about that.

926
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,690
By the way, get her posted right here.

927
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,230
Why?

928
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,520
Why do you question back?

929
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:16,060
If you join her at Annavaram or Gannavarm,
how does he meet?

930
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,810
Use some common sense.

931
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,400
Look dear, my guy already said her.

932
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:26,440
All these Police jobs are done by the idle
people and those with huge bellies like you.

933
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,940
But she didn't care.

934
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:29,150
Is it so?

935
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,100
Ok, are you free?
Why?

936
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,690
Nothing, I promised my
lover to bring you tomorrow.

937
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,350
Why?

938
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,520
What are questions like why, how?

939
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:41,060
Are you born to a human or animal?
Shut up and do what's said dear.

940
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,400
You come tomorrow morning
at 10:30 to hospital for seeing MLA.

941
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,270
We'll send AC vehicle for pick up and drop.

942
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,376
We'll also feed you chicken Biryani.
With leg piece.

943
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,350
Enjoy your self.

944
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,480
Is there anything else?

945
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,810
We wish to have a drink with
you, if this deal is ok.

946
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,230
Shall we go upstairs?

947
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,870
Why, you can't get a kick drinking here?

948
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,100
I think kick would be strong if upstairs.

949
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,440
Added you brought the material and
I should give the side dish, right?

950
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,230
Wow, he knows how to respect.

951
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,560
Order a prawn fry for me.

952
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,480
And mutton fry for me.
Sure.

953
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,730
Dear, this is imported drink.
Handle with care, ok?

954
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,890
I'm getting doubts seeing
upstairs, are these original?

955
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,810
Oh... Original dude...

956
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,770
We shall plan Singham 5 with you, ok?

957
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,480
Move up...
Yes.

958
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,600
Hey, this guy's very greedy for money.

959
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:34,060
Paying 5 more Lakhs, he looks
to give away his DGP post to me.

960
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,690
Yes, move on.
Move.

961
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,600
(HEY DEAR... LITTLE LORD KRISHNA...
WHO HIT YOU...?)

962
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,900
(HEY DEAR... LITTLE LORD KRISHNA...
WHO HIT YOU...?)

963
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,900
(MOM WAS HIT ME.)

964
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:56,270
I withstood how much ever he hit dude,
but he said a word at the end...

965
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,100
Saying you're Pushpa's husband.

966
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,770
Damn... I felt like dying for that...

967
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,980
MLA hasn't met Sadasivam
and didn't give the money.

968
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,650
Then what about that 10 Lakhs?

969
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,900
Hey, I'm feeling to have lost my prestige
and are you feeling for that 10 Lakhs?

970
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:17,400
All from a tailor to Police know
about Pushpa. How did I miss dude?

971
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,970
Shall we say Vasanthi about what really happened?
She'd hit with her slipper.

972
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,850
You gave the offer to hit with slipper,
if you don't bring Sadasivam, right?

973
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,416
It was you getting me trapped saying
Sadasivam is coming to hospital, right?

974
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,730
Hey, no use to fight in between us.

975
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,500
Arrange that 10 Lakhs if you can
or arrange Sadasivam at hospital.

976
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,600
Who ordered for Brandy?

977
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,940
Brandy is needed to get
down hits from Police.

978
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:41,990
How do you know that
these are by the Police?

979
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,980
I can just see and say which are the hits
by Police and which are from wife.

980
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,810
How?

981
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,350
I wished to be a Police from childhood.

982
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,270
Then what is this?

983
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,100
I later came to know that just dreams are not
enough to be a Police but also need education.

984
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,826
Will you be the Police
tomorrow in the morning?

985
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,850
Do you have any objection
if I become right today?

986
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,810
Why'd you come in auto?

987
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,900
This is high for what you gave.
I even fixed the red light.

988
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,600
Ok, say something and manage them.

989
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:24,690
Okay.

990
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,520
I use Government vehicle when I come on Government
work and use private vehicle when on private work.

991
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,310
Red light is common.

992
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,480
Are you in a confusion as I
said the answer without asking?

993
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,940
I'm of the same type. Come on, follow me.

994
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,900
Come inside after five minutes.

995
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,100
Come in...

996
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:48,100
He is our MLA.

997
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,770
Personality suited perfectly.
What's his daily payment?

998
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,350
He's original Original?

999
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,020
Look, once she comes in say with confidence
that her job is confirmed in department.

1000
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:01,230
Your duty is just to give the
dialogue and I'll excel it.

1001
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,440
Ok, do it great.
Okay.

1002
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:09,100
What's the scanning saying?
Hey, this is Xray.

1003
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,650
Oh... I too know.
I felt so as it was seen in reverse.

1004
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:17,810
Hello, give it here. Is it not open?

1005
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:24,190
Hit here, hit here and then here again.

1006
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,400
Yes, take it.

1007
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,060
Look dear, your job is
confirmed in Police department.

1008
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,940
In Police department?
Yes.

1009
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,980
Thank you Sir,

1010
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,750
I'll go to my Doctor and come back
resigning my job Ok, proceed.

1011
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,286
It's not with her that you
need to say that dialogue.

1012
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:42,190
I too know that...
I just did a rehearsal.

1013
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,980
Nurse too believed me,
means my performance is a hit, right?

1014
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,400
They'd give you a Nandi.

1015
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,600
Give me a tip even if they
don't give me a Nandi.

1016
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:52,100
Hey, they are coming...

1017
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:57,270
Good morning Sir.

1018
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,940
Hello, good morning Prashanthi.
How are you?

1019
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,520
My name is Vasanthi Sir.

1020
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,940
Vasanthi... Prashanthi...

1021
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:05,520
Yes.

1022
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:09,270
I tested whether you were alert or not.
Our department is so...

1023
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:14,060
By the way, your job in Police
department is confirmed Thank you Sir.

1024
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,536
Not for you madam, but for your daughter.

1025
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,270
Yes Sir, my daughter dreamt to be into
Police department from her childhood.

1026
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,690
They can't be by just dreaming
but should study hard.

1027
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:25,900
If not, they'd become bearers in the bar.

1028
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,150
Excuse me...
Yes.

1029
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,980
Why are so many here?
Is this a bar or an ICU?

1030
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:34,230
Don't insult the bar. We know how
many will be in a bar and how...

1031
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,020
Come here...

1032
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,350
Looks like you are in drink.

1033
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:44,190
Have you taken with beer in Mansion house?
You think I don't know that.

1034
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:45,900
You may have taken drink but... Hey...

1035
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:50,416
You had it, ok. But looks like you gave even to
him and is not getting up from the time we came.

1036
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,440
Ok, you please carry on, I will come again.

1037
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,310
No, don't come. Stay right there.

1038
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,060
You're so great Sir.
How could you find it out like that?

1039
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:00,900
Experience! I served for 25 years
and can't I find out this much?

1040
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,020
You served?

1041
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,770
I mean, he says to have served
Police department from 25 years.

1042
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,690
You start now,
you should go to the bar, right?

1043
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,230
Yes, for riding.

1044
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,270
Yes, didn't inform the owner too.

1045
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:13,940
What owner?

1046
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,730
That is... Owner means the Commissioner.

1047
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,190
Like we say bro for brother,
he calls Commissioner as owner in shortcut.

1048
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,810
Sir, thank you so much Sir.

1049
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,100
Not to me but say thanks to Veerababu.

1050
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:30,520
He worked very hard for you
If not what am I a Police Officer, my foot.

1051
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,560
Go on man.

1052
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,166
It's been a week since the blouse is given,
when will you give?

1053
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,706
I'll give an hour sister, please wait.

1054
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,520
Hey Veerababu? What's the hurry?

1055
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,270
Is it Pushpa's matter?

1056
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,166
Whole village knows that
Pushpa is a big matter.

1057
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,690
This is your matter My matter?

1058
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,536
It seems Police selections
results are out today.

1059
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,160
Vasanthi and her morther are coming
to the shop searching for you.

1060
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,166
Then, shall we close the shop?
Oh, yeah.

1061
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,150
Veerababu, my blouse...

1062
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,246
Come after 2 months and I will stitch it.

1063
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:03,980
What till then?
Stop wearing.

1064
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,440
You close it guys.

1065
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,060
We're caught, we're out.

1066
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:11,520
Knowing her name isn't there in results,
our drama will be out.

1067
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,270
Mom, shop is closed.

1068
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:20,020
Have you too given blouses to this fellow?

1069
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,440
Come after two months.

1070
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,190
What's that?

1071
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,990
He has said the same to me
and is sitting inside closing the shutter.

1072
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:25,900
Idiot..

1073
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,706
You don't take any tension dude. We shall stay
right here for a week closing the shutter.

1074
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:32,890
Our Jacket idiot will be out of Coma by then and then
we shall give back their ten lakhs taking from him.

1075
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,560
You think we can't know where you are.

1076
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:41,940
What Sir, you did it all
and are now hiding in here?

1077
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,560
Actually I don't anything madam.
He did it all.

1078
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,690
You know madam?
I know.

1079
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:48,060
Where are you going? You too have it.

1080
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:49,480
Give that here.

1081
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,900
Not that Vasanthi,
I actually would go to MLA and...

1082
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,800
Thought she would bash us and
why did she take out the sweet?

1083
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,980
I'm very happy Veerababu.

1084
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:00,770
Getting a Police job is tough
and I got it in my own place.

1085
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,020
What, you got the job?
It's all because of you...

1086
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,350
I won't forget your help in my life time.

1087
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,826
You can't forget even in next life knowing
the real matter madam.

1088
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,310
DGP Sadasivam called us in the morning and
said this good news instead of good morning.

1089
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,706
I didn't say you this as you would
miss the thrill knowing it in advance.

1090
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:15,560
Really?
Yeah.

1091
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,980
Absolutely, unfortunately...

1092
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,770
I'm joining in duty tomorrow
and you should come for sure.

1093
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,770
Congrats Vasanthi Thank you.

1094
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,980
Look, it's like insulting
me if you say thanks.

1095
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:28,730
Okay.

1096
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:30,520
All the best madam Thank you.

1097
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,310
Hey Suri, is this a dream or true?

1098
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,940
How did this miracle take place?

1099
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,850
Hey, didn't the public believe
when KA Paul said he made Trump win?

1100
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,690
This too is the same.

1101
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:40,530
What if she comes to know the truth later?

1102
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:45,060
Hey, say her I love you by then, marry and have
two children and they'll be there on safe side.

1103
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,100
Thanks for the good idea.

1104
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:48,190
Hey, I didn't give you
idea for your thanks. Then?

1105
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:50,150
No idea when our Jacket
fellow would come out.

1106
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:55,100
Vasanthi anyways has become an SI and thought
to deal Pushpa's matter from this side.

1107
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,680
Hey, I won't delay anymore. I'll propose
my love right tomorrow in a grand way.

1108
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,310
Hey, you're going to propose for
the first time. Take my blessings.

1109
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,810
The guy winning in love would win in life

1110
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,190
and the guy losing in love
would win over the world.

1111
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,020
Hey, Veerababu.

1112
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,650
Take off the autos...

1113
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,770
Two wheelers shouldn't be parked here.

1114
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,520
Maybe the buffalos would move
but these wouldn't move madam.

1115
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,020
Stop,

1116
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,650
Is it enough.. Yes.

1117
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:26,310
What is this?

1118
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,076
You've kept the shop right on the road.

1119
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,150
You've come new here but we've been doing
business here, from years madam.

1120
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:34,511
It was different till now
and would be different from now.

1121
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:37,900
Vasanthi has come and you should
vacate this place by tomorrow and leave

1122
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,770
I understood why you got anger madam.
Here, take this.

1123
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:42,400
What is this?

1124
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,350
Bribe madam, this is normal for us.

1125
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,480
You bribe me?

1126
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,440
What's wrong madam?

1127
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,730
You got the job bribing 10 Lakhs. You
should collect back with interest, right?

1128
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,600
Hey, what are you talking too much?

1129
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,190
Enough, take off your hands madam.

1130
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:57,770
You can get jobs by bribing
and can't we do business?

1131
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:01,730
Madam, all are watching us. Move madam.

1132
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,730
Goddess of Justice is come to save the law!

1133
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,150
Go...

1134
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,650
You can get jobs by bribing
and can't we do business?

1135
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,376
Take the vehicle directly to SP office.
Ok Madam.

1136
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,690
SP sir is in meeting with
DGP Sadasivam Sir, madam.

1137
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,650
Is even DGP Sadasivam right there?

1138
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,060
Very good.

1139
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,850
I'll throw my resignation
letter right over his face.

1140
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,560
What, will you resign job?

1141
00:57:30,770 --> 00:57:33,350
Who said I gave you the
posting taking bribe?

1142
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,980
All are aware that DGP Sadasivam is loyal.

1143
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,730
You didn't get the job because
of bribe or recommendation.

1144
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,260
It has come because of your merit.

1145
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,030
Someone cheated your mom
and looted the money.

1146
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,400
Find out who he is and show
the power of Police uniform.

1147
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:23,060
Oh, you! We were tensed thinking
terrorists attacked on the station.

1148
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:24,440
What's this mess?

1149
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,690
I came to propose your madam.

1150
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,230
Hey...
Sir.

1151
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,286
You guys are stay right here.

1152
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:31,600
I will scream loud once
she says yes to me inside.

1153
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,876
Immediately you play the band to
pierce the sound through the ears.

1154
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,076
We'll play such that your
screams can't be heard out Sir.

1155
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,020
You'll see it.

1156
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,980
Even AR Rehman wouldn't say so confidently.

1157
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:39,650
Good.

1158
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,560
Thank you Sir...

1159
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,940
Wow, what a style.

1160
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,440
Not left right but it's right is right

1161
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,560
(I'M A LOVER ALSO, FIGHTER ALSO...)

1162
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:52,020
My dear friendly Police,
today is valentines day for me.

1163
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,310
So, ask for whatever you need.

1164
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,060
Veerababu... Promotion for me

1165
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,190
I'll inform MLA and get you
promoted as Home guard, Ok?

1166
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,350
Home guard?
Yes.

1167
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,150
That isn't a promotion but the demotion.

1168
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:04,270
Some motion... Ok, is DSP fine.

1169
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,310
Brother Yes.

1170
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,706
Are offers only for the Police
and none for us, the prisoners?

1171
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:08,940
What have you done bro?

1172
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,230
I broke one guy's head bro.

1173
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,940
Oh, that's all? It's cheap

1174
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:12,850
I'll do one thing

1175
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,786
I'll make them a murder case on you
and they would transfer you to Tihar jail.

1176
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,100
Your level will go up. Ok?

1177
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,850
Yes, where is my darling?

1178
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,810
Madam went out on duty, wait here.

1179
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:22,900
You think, I came here as I was idle?

1180
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,800
Still, what's me waiting for her? She must
wait for me in future after we get married.

1181
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:32,690
Hello.

1182
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,810
Hello Vaasu, I got to meet you urgently

1183
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,850
I too should meet you urgently,

1184
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,076
if you say your whereabouts,
I'll come and meet you urgently.

1185
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,730
Where else would I be, in our station.

1186
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,900
It'd be comfortable, stay right there.
I'll come right away.

1187
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,850
I won't leave till you come

1188
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,270
I won't let you leave at all, after I come.

1189
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,560
I am waiting.

1190
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,350
(HEY GOLDEN CHICK...)

1191
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,690
What man, driving with eyes closed?

1192
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:58,520
This is Police vehicle man.

1193
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,920
What if Police vehicle?
Aren't the eggs broken when dashed?

1194
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,150
Boss, why mess? They will give money...

1195
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:05,440
Hey no money nothing, leave...

1196
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,440
Madam, hello madam...

1197
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,400
Pay 5000 at the rate of 5 each for 100 eggs

1198
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,270
500 enough for 100 eggs, sir.

1199
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:17,100
We too know it's 500 and who'd give
the tips? Will your driver give?

1200
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,190
Madam, have you become Police madam?

1201
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:21,310
Hey...

1202
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,440
Hello madam...

1203
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:29,600
Come on bring him.

1204
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:30,690
Hey, move in...

1205
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,410
Your madam and I'll go here for Honeymoon.

1206
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:34,770
We go here Into the Seas?

1207
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,060
Welcome Vasanthi, welcome.

1208
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:41,440
I've been waiting eagerly for you to come.

1209
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,440
I'm coming to you with 100 sticks.

1210
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:43,980
Good joke.

1211
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,810
Sense of humor is gone high in you
after becoming a Police officer.

1212
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:49,050
Huh, who's he? Is he a terrorist?

1213
01:00:49,770 --> 01:00:50,270
Congrats,

1214
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:53,111
did you catch such a big criminal just
on the second day of your duty?

1215
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,060
Still, his body language says
he isn't a criminal but a supplier.

1216
01:00:57,810 --> 01:00:59,770
Like a guy supplying beers at bar, right?

1217
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:00,560
Exactly...

1218
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:01,650
Leave about this fellow.

1219
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:04,600
How much will DGP
Sadasivam take for posting?

1220
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:10,600
That is... He takes 20 to 25 Lakhs for all.
He took 10 for you as I requested in special.

1221
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:12,980
Yes! I brought him to
station for saying thanks.

1222
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,020
Is it?

1223
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:17,900
Closed... Finished...
You're trapped Veerababu.

1224
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,350
Who's this fellow looking
just like our DGP Sir?

1225
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,440
Hey, don't overact Then, ok.

1226
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,980
When I was taking eggs to bar,
madam caught me like a duck.

1227
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,060
You rascal...

1228
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,600
Call from a celebrity, I'll just be back.
Stop, who is that celebrity?

1229
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,626
He's like Bigg Boss.
He won't be seen but just heard.

1230
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:35,020
Then make us listen.

1231
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,850
What dude, have my blessings worked out?

1232
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,850
Did you say, I love you to Vasanthi?

1233
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:46,600
If she overacts, take her into a lockup
without prisoners and then... give lip lock.

1234
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,150
Oh no..Hey...

1235
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,730
She'd then be just behind you
like a Constable behind SI.

1236
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:52,810
You idiot...

1237
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:53,440
Hey...

1238
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,770
I spoke a deal with that Gudumba Govindam.

1239
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:59,400
He's saying to give one Lakh per month if
he's given permission to prepare Gudumba.

1240
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,270
We three would get 33 each, if you
settle the deal talking to your lover.

1241
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:05,170
Ask that idiot to come here first.

1242
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:05,980
Will you kill?

1243
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,746
I'd never say what I'll be doing?
So, you'll say after killing?

1244
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,900
Why're you silent dude?
Is anybody beside you?

1245
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,190
Say him to come.

1246
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:13,100
None is here.

1247
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,416
You come to the Police station
and we shall directly talk.

1248
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,440
That is better.

1249
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,810
He's coming and I'll leave.

1250
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:19,850
Where'll you go?

1251
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,630
Idiot, why do you fall on me? Get up.

1252
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:23,100
Oh no... No...

1253
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:26,520
Hey, Sir is screaming
and play the band now.

1254
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,270
Vasanthi, listen please. Listen to me

1255
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:33,350
I'm saying no, please stop...
Oh no... No...

1256
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,400
Arrangements are great from our guy.
Idiot has even a music taste.

1257
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:51,810
Hair is shabby and even the shirt is with
folds. Did you finish first night already?

1258
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:54,060
Yeah...

1259
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:56,126
My guy would've already
explained you the deal.

1260
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:59,730
Look, though we're going to do illegal
business we should have a clarity between us.

1261
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,916
Do they give shake hand even like this?

1262
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:03,940
Why did she hit so dude?

1263
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,126
Is this why we made her a
Police taking so much risk?

1264
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:09,270
Look, I'll call that DG Sadasivam
right away and dismissed you.

1265
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,440
Cal him, come on call him.

1266
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,980
You say such a big man as rascal.
You're gone now.

1267
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,100
You're out..

1268
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:20,900
Cut it dude.

1269
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:23,190
Why's he cutting the call?

1270
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,746
I think he's in a meeting.
He'll call back looking at the missed call.

1271
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,480
No problem call again I will

1272
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:31,400
I will call again and again.
It is the last for you in this dress.

1273
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,730
If you have any selfies to
take, do it right away

1274
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:36,400
(PHONE RINGING...)

1275
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,830
What, why is the ring coming from behind?

1276
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:46,850
Oh, is our DGP Sadasivam Sir right here?

1277
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,100
Make me dismiss.

1278
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:50,550
Come on, I said for fun and why
do you take it so seriously?

1279
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,810
Bro, did she hit?

1280
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,650
I expected you'd get hit right
that day when you overacted.

1281
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:00,610
Ok, I'll come and meet
when my time is good.

1282
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:03,560
Oh no, she's killing me.

1283
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,680
What rascal, why're you
screaming even before I hit?

1284
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,456
As I may not have the
energy after getting hit.

1285
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,730
You...
Oh no...

1286
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,310
Oh no...

1287
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,730
Enough of that hitting, stop it.
I said stop it.

1288
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,520
Get my 10 Lakhs immediately.

1289
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,480
Madam, arrange even for my Ten thousand.

1290
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,350
Get out idiot Ok madam.

1291
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,190
Money isn't coming even from ATM and how'll
you get money asking penniless like us?

1292
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:31,850
If you don't give my money in 24 hours, I'll take off your
clothes and make you roam on streets in under garments

1293
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,190
I'm safe then why...?

1294
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:34,900
I won't wear under garments
You...

1295
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:35,980
Oh No...

1296
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,326
Why do you hit right there when
I said didn't wear under garment?

1297
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:40,940
Hello... What, did MLA gain consciousness?

1298
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:42,560
Is MLA regained consciousness?

1299
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,826
Is Jacket back to consciousness?

1300
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:46,980
Hey, it seems MLA is back to consciousness.
Is it.

1301
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,710
It seems MLA is back to consciousness.

1302
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,060
Oh no...

1303
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:51,520
Stop it I say.

1304
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,100
Not in 24 but in 24 hours I'll get
your money and throw on your face.

1305
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:55,690
Well said.

1306
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,560
You said great like the Telugu film hero.

1307
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:00,400
You are under dismissed
Be ready packing your luggage

1308
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:01,810
I'm waiting

1309
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,350
I'm coming soon

1310
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,730
and nearby theaters.

1311
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:07,400
Hey, stop idiot.

1312
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:13,520
Hey, play the band now guys...

1313
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:16,150
Silly... silly..Silly fellows...

1314
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:18,690
funny... funny..funnyy fellows...

1315
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:22,190
Silly... silly..Silly fellows...

1316
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,850
(CHOTA BHEEM... CHOTA BHEEM...)

1317
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:45,480
(CHOTA BHEEM... CHOTA BHEEM...)

1318
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:46,310
Brother.

1319
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,480
Brother, are you good? Thank God.

1320
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,350
You know how happy am I seeing you so?

1321
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,690
I was thinking to enter Coma
myself and talk to you, brother.

1322
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:57,150
That Pushpa came to my house
and is asking to be a family.

1323
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:58,520
I couldn't bear that and...

1324
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,770
Oh no...

1325
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:03,850
See bro, you listening are unable to bear
and how much should I feel bad?

1326
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,440
Hey, great...

1327
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:09,020
( A SMALL TWIST IN THE STORY...)

1328
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,350
Why does he say so dude?

1329
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,230
Hey, say the real matter.

1330
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:14,940
Bro, you should come immediately
and make Pushpa sign on these papers.

1331
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,270
Who is Pushpa?

1332
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:18,940
Who is Pushpa...!?

1333
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:24,150
You are the only man asking
who is Pushpa, brother.

1334
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,666
Hey, I'm not knowing
whether to laugh or to cry.

1335
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:27,690
You wait dude...

1336
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:30,666
Brother, you took 10 Lakh saying to
get Police job for Vasnthi, right brother?

1337
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,100
Who is Vasanthi?

1338
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,650
Daughter of that hotel lady, brother.

1339
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:35,400
Who are you uncle?

1340
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:36,810
Uncle...?

1341
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,230
Why does he call me uncle, sister in law?

1342
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:40,770
What to say Veerababu?

1343
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:44,480
Crying from the morning,
who is this aunty, uncle?

1344
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,480
Am I an auntie?

1345
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,770
Who are you, aunty?

1346
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,940
No, he's saying me aunty.
Control sister in law.

1347
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:53,190
Hello, my dear boy, how are you?

1348
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,520
Doctor Sir, what's wrong with my husband?

1349
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:59,130
Before you listen to what I say...

1350
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:02,480
Don't say like make your heart strong,
kidneys soft etc., Say what's wrong.

1351
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:07,150
His head had a strong wound in the accident
and there was a small damage to his brain.

1352
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,480
And MLA sir is gone back
to his 10 years of age.

1353
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,826
And MLA sir is gone back
to his 10 years of age.

1354
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:14,150
From his recent reactions,
I thought he's into Amnesia.

1355
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:16,520
This situation is very
rare about one in a crore.

1356
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:19,190
He's lost 40 years and gone
back to 10 years of age.

1357
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:22,150
Will it take 40 more years for him
to come back to the present?

1358
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:24,076
That means...
Should I be Pushpa's husband till then?

1359
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,666
Are you happy now?
Come on, stay calm dude.

1360
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:28,940
Doctor Sir, how long will it take for
my husband to get a cure from this madness?

1361
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,730
No, this isn't madness
but just the memory loss.

1362
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,690
What if we take to Kerala?

1363
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:36,100
Are tours and honeymoon needed now?

1364
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:38,190
Not for that Doctor but to
get Ayurvedic treatment.

1365
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,770
No, then my treatment?
We've seen it right?

1366
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:46,060
Yes, take him and see. He'll then lose the balance
of his mind and goes to his 3 or 4 years of age.

1367
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:48,666
If it goes so, shall I forget about
my divorce matter and change his diapers?

1368
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,560
Not just that,
you'll have to carry him daily.

1369
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:51,850
Enough, give it.

1370
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:54,376
Come with me, I'll write all tests
available and you can get them done.

1371
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,270
Auntie, please carry me. Oh God.

1372
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:58,810
Sister in law...

1373
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,310
I'm crying as my life is ruined
and are you licking the lollypop?

1374
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:11,150
Dear, you're coming from, inside right?

1375
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:12,650
Is MLA sir back to consciousness?

1376
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,480
What just conscious, he is jumping.

1377
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,350
Wow...
Oh no.

1378
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,900
What's this man, you poured
tomato sauce like a kid in your ears?

1379
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:21,690
Wow, I thought you'd say it blood.
You identified greatly.

1380
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:24,400
Dear, how do I talk with brother?

1381
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:28,480
Grab his lollypop and then
he'll answer correctly.

1382
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,980
Hey, take this point. Thank you

1383
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,100
(RINGA RINGA ROSES, POCKETFUL OF ROSES...)

1384
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:37,940
(RINGA RINGA ROSES, POCKETFUL OF ROSES...)

1385
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,980
What's he licking a
lollypop like a mad fellow?

1386
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:46,270
Nothing bro, maybe his taste buds are down
as he was in Coma from a longtime.

1387
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,600
I think Doctor said to
lick and he is licking.

1388
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:49,746
Ok, ask about the matter first.

1389
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:53,100
Hey Jacket macho,
where did that Minister hide money?

1390
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:56,020
(CUTE BABY PARROT...)

1391
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,690
Yes, it seems at our
shop owner Chilakamma...

1392
01:08:58,730 --> 01:08:59,350
What next...?

1393
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,980
Did your mom hit and have
you been to the garden?

1394
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,350
Oh no, it seems her mom hit,
and she went to garden. Ok, next...

1395
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:09,730
Did you bring the fruit
and hide in the shelf?

1396
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,520
Bro, it seems she kept it
in the shelf at the garden.

1397
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,230
Ok, next...

1398
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:14,560
Did you swallow it?

1399
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,020
Oh God, it seems she swallowed 500 crores.

1400
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:18,020
Oh no...

1401
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:22,190
Idiot, are you translating Andhra
Pradesh Telugu to Telangana Telugu?

1402
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:23,850
He is singing rhymes.

1403
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:24,900
Yes.

1404
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,270
Cutie baby parrot...

1405
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:27,440
Snatch that...

1406
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,376
come on pull that lollypop.
Are you overacting rascal?

1407
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,560
Say where did you hide it?
Say, where did you hide that money?

1408
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:35,350
Oh no...

1409
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:36,900
Stop it now.

1410
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,270
Hey ghost, it seems Jacket
is out from Coma right?

1411
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,350
He asked for you immediately
after coming out of Coma, brother.

1412
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,270
Really?
Yes.

1413
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:44,810
Why?
No idea why bro,

1414
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:46,900
but he'd say in your ears if you ask him.

1415
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,850
Why'd you pour tomato sauce on your ears.

1416
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,980
Oh, you too felt so?

1417
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:56,600
Nothing, they said in YouTube that hairs in
and out of ears are gone with tomato sauce.

1418
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:59,520
Why all those for you bro?
MLA is waiting for you, go.

1419
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,150
Come on dude, come Coming.

1420
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,400
Bro, don't pull out that lollypop
from his mouth by mistake.

1421
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,690
To hell with that idiot...

1422
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,730
He's said so means there's
something in that lollypop.

1423
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:11,770
Correct brother.

1424
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,900
Abhijeet Brother.

1425
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,560
You think that Jacket
fellow is really gone mad?

1426
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,996
Bro, it's like you are gone mad
thinking that fellow is mad.

1427
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:20,560
Confirmed?
What if not?

1428
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:25,940
That rascal is playing drama
as mad looting 500 crores.

1429
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,310
Oh no..
Hey...

1430
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:27,900
Brother...

1431
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,060
It's very difficult to make him
say the truth in this hospital.

1432
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,520
Let's kidnap him this night.

1433
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,520
(RAIN, RANI GO AWAY...)

1434
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,850
What Mr. Jacket, how are you?

1435
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:40,650
That Minister position is mine,
if you hadn't come out of Coma.

1436
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:45,730
(NOT JUST THE SEAT BUT WON'T LET YOU
CROSS EVEN THE ASSEMBLY GATE...)

1437
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:49,560
Wow great... Uncle said it great right?

1438
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,270
He's still not lost his fun.

1439
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,480
Hey, pull that lollypop first...

1440
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:58,770
Oh no...

1441
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,770
Hey, that Jacket guy
is playing some dramas.

1442
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,440
Get him tonight by kidnapping.

1443
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,150
Ok brother.

1444
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:07,400
Cheers...
Cheers.

1445
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,400
Hey, Vasanthi is saying to hit us on the
roads with under garments on our bodies.

1446
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,190
That Jacket is biting the ears.
I'm not knowing what to do.

1447
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:19,150
Listen to me and run away to some Pakistan or
Bangladesh and can come back after MLA is better.

1448
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:21,810
Is she any Arundhati or Sivagami to fear?

1449
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,230
Oh no, Police.
Oh no, I didn't wear an under wear.

1450
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:26,480
Is she now hit me...?

1451
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,520
Hey, it's an Ambulance.

1452
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:34,810
Why are you laughing, guys?

1453
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:38,810
Ambulance comes if someone gets a heart attack,
but you get a heart attack if Ambulance comes.

1454
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:41,416
They say to give a side when Ambulance
comes and thus we gave a side.

1455
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,400
It's all from the top
but fears to her from in.

1456
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,520
Not a fear but love.

1457
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,770
Fear exists where there is love.

1458
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:50,900
Mine is a fear to lose my loved ones.

1459
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:13,350
Life is a big headache...
Life is a big headache...

1460
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,600
Love isn't a matter to be
settled having a quarter.

1461
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:25,810
Life is a big headache...
Life is a big headache...

1462
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:30,060
Baby twists the life into
circles putting a ring to finger.

1463
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:34,650
Love is headache and having
lover is a headache...

1464
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:38,900
Life with no love and lover
is a further headache...

1465
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:43,190
It's headache with the girl
and more with the marriage...

1466
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:47,150
Bachelor life is a further bigger headache.

1467
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,190
It's a headache helping and
headache being selfish too.

1468
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:57,190
Headache can't be avoided
if you have a head.

1469
01:12:57,230 --> 01:13:01,150
Don't ask for a life without
that, God gets a headache.

1470
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:05,520
Headache comes on to you
once you are onto this earth.

1471
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:09,810
Headache won't leave you till
you're out from this earth.

1472
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:31,440
Life is a big headache...
Life is a big headache...

1473
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,900
Babe has tightened life like
Income Tax people attacked over the house.

1474
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:39,770
Life is a big headache...
Life is a big headache...

1475
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:44,150
Have we become alone in life like
ATMs with no cash after demonetization?

1476
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:48,810
RGV has a headache with women associations.

1477
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:52,810
Hero fans have a headache
from critics like Kathi.

1478
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,150
Astrologers have a headache
with people like Gogineni.

1479
01:13:57,310 --> 01:14:01,150
Headache becoming weak
with Veeramachaneni diet.

1480
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:05,350
Released films have a
headache with ratings.

1481
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:11,310
Headache can't be avoided
if you have a head.

1482
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:15,440
Don't ask for a life without
that, God gets a headache.

1483
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,480
Headache comes on to you
once you are onto this earth.

1484
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,980
Headache won't leave you till
you're out from this earth.

1485
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:44,560
Life is a big headache...
Life is a big headache...

1486
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,900
Life is a big drama like the fight of
Tamil brothers after Amma expired.

1487
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:52,940
Life is a big headache...
Life is a big headache...

1488
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:57,230
Brain is gone to dirt like Lalu
jailed getting into the grass scam.

1489
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:01,650
Center has a headache
from the special status.

1490
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:05,850
State gets a headache taking the package.

1491
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:10,150
Headache with girls when
Rakhi festival comes.

1492
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:14,400
Headache from Bhajrangdal
when lovers day is here.

1493
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,520
Consoling tour pacifying after
troubling is a big headache for me.

1494
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,310
Headache can't be avoided
if you have a head.

1495
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:28,310
Don't ask for a life without
that, God gets a headache.

1496
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,650
Headache comes on to you
once you are onto this earth.

1497
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:36,900
Headache won't leave you till
you're out from this earth.

1498
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,310
Is this real...! I thought it was a dream.

1499
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,940
Saying to return money in an hour,
are you into drink and dance coming here?

1500
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:56,270
Where are my 10 lakhs?

1501
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,020
On the way.
On the way?

1502
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,560
You'll have it bad.

1503
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,900
If I don't receive my money
by tomorrow morning...

1504
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,376
Won't you take if we give in the night?

1505
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,650
Even if I'd be there to take, you won't
be alive to give. I'll encounter you.

1506
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:09,850
Oh no, really?

1507
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:11,310
Confirmed.

1508
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:25,900
Hey, it'd be great insult dying in
encounter, after leading such a great life.

1509
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:28,650
I have an idea to escape from her.

1510
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,600
I know dude.
You'll handover me and escape, right?

1511
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,100
No dude, we shall kidnap brother.

1512
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:35,166
Why kidnap?
Enough that he is discharged, right?

1513
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,990
Doctors won't agree in
the present condition.

1514
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,270
Then kidnap is correct.

1515
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:46,810
The name of operation which
we are doing now is...

1516
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:48,916
You called for the kidnap,
but again saying it as an operation.

1517
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:53,480
Idiot, the name of the
kidnap is operation Jacket.

1518
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,810
Come on, follow me.

1519
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:12,020
Hey, doctors who come for rounds
will get doubt, if this bed is empty.

1520
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:14,310
So, I will sleep here in his place.

1521
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,310
You guys take him from here.
I will come later.

1522
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:17,560
You are super, brother.

1523
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,020
First, take him from here.

1524
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,810
Oh god, how is he so heavy?

1525
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:25,650
Brother, you sleep now.

1526
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:30,150
Hey, wear face mask.

1527
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:35,060
Hey, somebody is coming.

1528
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,310
Good morning, doctor.
Good night, doctor.

1529
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,600
Come.

1530
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,310
Did you get the spray?

1531
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,600
Yes, I brought.
Spray it.

1532
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,480
Idiot, I told you bring
spray for unconsciousness.

1533
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:06,060
Hey, doctors who come for rounds
will get doubt, if this bed is empty.

1534
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,900
You guys take him from here. I will sleep
here in his place. I will come later.

1535
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,060
You are super, brother.
Let's go.

1536
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,270
Hey, doctors coming.

1537
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:25,190
Good night, doctor.

1538
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,480
Mid night, doctor.

1539
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:37,650
Doctor, it may be higher dosage.

1540
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,770
His body requires it.

1541
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,150
He will sleep happily throughout the night,
with this anaesthesia.

1542
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:45,270
Oh no..

1543
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:48,060
Take rest my boy.

1544
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:59,230
Brother...

1545
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:01,480
Hey, he is in deep sleep.

1546
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,290
Help me, we shall take him from here.

1547
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,350
Hey, doctors coming,
will put him in this room.

1548
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:20,770
Yes doctor, patient out of
danger, it's a medical miracle.

1549
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,230
He is still sleeping,
let's take him from here.

1550
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:35,850
Brother.

1551
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:39,150
Ok.
Ok.

1552
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:41,980
Okay.

1553
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:46,230
I got to know today,

1554
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:50,150
I know it today,

1555
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,850
My beautiful dream has got the shape!

1556
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:57,270
That's like you...

1557
01:19:57,310 --> 01:19:58,310
Oh...!

1558
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,400
Oh no... What I ask and what you did...?

1559
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,400
Show me his face before he dies.

1560
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,440
Sure.

1561
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:08,650
Hey, what's this. Why did you bring him?

1562
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:12,940
You drunk idiots!
I will kill you all. Wait.

1563
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,020
I am going by car!

1564
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,440
By the way, what's your plan.

1565
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,520
I will tell you.

1566
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,690
Dear Janakiram, do you want lollipop or not?
I want uncle.

1567
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:27,270
Did you kidnapped him to give lollipop?

1568
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:28,400
Wait.

1569
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:30,650
Then, what will you answer to Vasanthi.

1570
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:37,150
Vasanthi, it is the fact that I have taken
10 lacs from Veerababu.

1571
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:42,100
I couldn't give it to DGP,
as I met with accident.

1572
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,480
I will give back your money,
you don't mistake Veerababu.

1573
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,230
Veerababu loves you sincerely.

1574
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,400
With this, your problem will be solved.
What about mine?

1575
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,480
Wait and see.

1576
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,960
Then, what will you answer to Pushpa.

1577
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:05,270
Pushpa, a small mistake is happened,
when I did marriage event.

1578
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:09,850
For that reason,
you should not trouble Suribabu.

1579
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:15,940
You immediately sign on divorce papers
and leave his house.

1580
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:19,770
It is my order as MLA.

1581
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:20,900
How is it, uncle?

1582
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,230
Super, Jacket.

1583
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:25,400
I made him practice all these dialogues,
throughout the night.

1584
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:28,770
Anyhow, Pushpa and Vasanthi are not
aware about his mental condition.

1585
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:29,440
Yes.

1586
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,900
You solved our problems
with just 2 lollipops.

1587
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:35,150
Alright, let's go to
police station directly.

1588
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,020
Sure.

1589
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:39,060
I am tired of making him practice
all dialogues, throughout the night.

1590
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,416
Take a nap. I will wake you up,
once we reach police station.

1591
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:47,400
Uncle, there,
cow and bull are loving each other.

1592
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,280
Hey, why did you drive to your house,
instead to the police station.

1593
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:57,690
First, I should get rid of my problem.

1594
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,690
Hey, Pushpa, come out.

1595
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:05,810
Let's conclude it today.
Hey, come out.

1596
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:06,980
Hey, come out.

1597
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:10,230
What's this?

1598
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:15,770
You might see lion on TV and movie,
but you did not see directly, right.

1599
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:16,810
Watch now.

1600
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:18,810
What's this snoring?

1601
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:21,270
It's not snoring, it is a roar.

1602
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:24,150
You said, you will sign on divorce
papers, if I bring MLA.

1603
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:25,206
See, here is MLA Mr. Jacket.

1604
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,020
Greetings, sir.

1605
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:29,020
Shut up and sign on these papers.

1606
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:31,480
Ok, give me those papers.
Take it.

1607
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,020
That's the way you should behave.

1608
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:37,480
Did you see, her body language is changed.

1609
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,310
Hey, you wait.
Brother, you please come.

1610
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:44,270
It seems, you said, you will not sign on
divorce papers, until MLA brought here.

1611
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:48,900
Brother, being gentleman,
give the judgment to separate them.

1612
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:52,230
She is agreed to sign,
why is his performance required?

1613
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:53,666
You wait, how can we leave it as such.

1614
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:54,770
Brother, you tell her.

1615
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:57,850
Vasanthi.
Vasanthi?

1616
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,900
It is the fact that I have taken 10 lacs from Veerababu.
Not this, other one.

1617
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:06,350
I couldn't give it to DGP,
as I met with accident.

1618
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,900
You spoiled it.

1619
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:12,060
I will give back your money,
you don't mistake Veerababu.

1620
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,560
Veerababu loves you sincerely.

1621
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:16,400
Am I correct, uncle?

1622
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,350
You are telling Vasanthi's
dialogue to Pushpa.

1623
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,720
Change the dialogue and tell her.

1624
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:23,810
I will tell only one dialogue for one lollipop.
What?

1625
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:27,020
I will tell you a dialogue, if you give me a lollipop.
Hey, get out.

1626
01:23:27,230 --> 01:23:29,980
What is this,
you can't do anything properly.

1627
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,060
It's my mistake to be with you.

1628
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:33,786
You are trying to cheat
me with this mental.

1629
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:34,940
I will not sign.

1630
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:37,100
Wash those utensils and bring in.

1631
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:40,430
Seems, I should wash utensils.

1632
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,560
What did I do to you?

1633
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,730
Sweets! Sweets!

1634
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:45,850
Hey, sweets!

1635
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:48,350
Hey, sweets boy, wait.

1636
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,520
Sweets! Sweets!

1637
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:56,940
If you could stay calm for a minute,
I would have taken sign on these papers.

1638
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:58,730
Sorry, dude. It's my mistake.

1639
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:02,600
Before going to Vasanthi,
we shall practice it again.

1640
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:08,060
It is ok for you, if my life is spoiled.
And, you want your life to be happy.

1641
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,496
Everything is happened, because of him.

1642
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,560
Hey, where is he?

1643
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,940
He is just a kid of 10 years.

1644
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:17,230
Yes, he is innocent, you are
clever, in between I am cheated.

1645
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:18,310
Let's go search for him.

1646
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,730
(DISTINCT VOICES..)

1647
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:22,560
Greetings sir.

1648
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,310
Hey, MLA sir also came.

1649
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,440
Please come everybody.

1650
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,060
Close the factory and save the village.

1651
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:31,150
MLA joins the protest,
let's continue this movement at any cost.

1652
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:34,600
At any cost, I should not
leave him without having sweet.

1653
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:35,940
Sweet! Sweet!

1654
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,850
Hey, wait.

1655
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,100
Everybody is struggling by this factory.

1656
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:40,980
We will take a stay order.

1657
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:43,060
Why stay order, we will take it now itself.

1658
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:46,206
Greetings, sir.
Hey, sweet vendor!

1659
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:48,230
Who wants your greetings.
He is going away.

1660
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:49,286
What is he telling about Sweet?

1661
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:51,980
He is telling that he will
kill him and distribute sweets.

1662
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:57,310
All-time wish of Satyanarayanapuram's
residents is transformed as a movement.

1663
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,690
Mr. Jacket Janakiram is leading this
movement from the front.

1664
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,850
Let's ask him about his
views on this movement.

1665
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:08,190
Sir, what is the reason
behind this serious movement?

1666
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,440
Sweets! Sweets!

1667
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:14,900
Save our Village...

1668
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:19,350
He is a great leader, is said that he
will not speak until company is closed.

1669
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,480
What is this?

1670
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:23,400
You took bribe to start the factory.

1671
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:27,230
Now, you are cheating us, by initiating
a movement with your party MLA.

1672
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,150
No, I am drinking.

1673
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:33,060
Indecent fellow...
stop drinking and watch the news.

1674
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:36,480
Intelligent fellow?

1675
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:39,060
We shall see his end today.

1676
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,900
Hey, it's Jacket.

1677
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:44,350
Mr. Jacket is playing some drama,

1678
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:48,190
kill him and create an impression
that factory owner is killed him.

1679
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:51,940
How dare is he to scold
me as intelligent fellow?

1680
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:56,850
Hey, there he is.
Hey, move away.

1681
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,650
Brother, where are you going?

1682
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:01,560
That, sweets boy is going away.

1683
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:02,480
Sweets...

1684
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:03,520
We are getting irritation.

1685
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:05,456
Then come with me,
I will buy sweets for you too.

1686
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,720
Hey, we have no other option, we should
bring him to our way by behaving like him.

1687
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:12,850
He is roaming on roads as a mental person,
let's take him from here.

1688
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:15,580
He will lose dignity, if everyone
knows about his mental condition.

1689
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,230
Hey, Abhijeet, what's this.

1690
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:21,400
You said, he is behaving
like 10-year-old child.

1691
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,400
But, he is leading a movement.

1692
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,810
Yes, brother. I guess,
he is planning to take 500 crores.

1693
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,400
What are you planning here?

1694
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,810
Go and bring him here.

1695
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:31,480
Let's go.

1696
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,230
Close the factory and save the village.

1697
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:39,480
Close the factory and save the village.

1698
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:43,520
Close the factory and save the village.

1699
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:45,440
Where are you going?
Just come with me.

1700
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:48,520
Should be closed!
Should be closed!

1701
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,560
Attack!

1702
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,100
Attack!

1703
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:55,310
Something is happening here,
let's take him from here.

1704
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:58,730
Hey, move.

1705
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:04,650
Careful, brother.

1706
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:12,810
Hey, move.

1707
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,060
Move.

1708
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:15,310
My sweet!

1709
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,916
Brother come here.
First, take MLA sir into the ambulance.

1710
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:20,060
MLA's mental condition is bad.
Please listen to me.

1711
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,270
Don't confuse in between.

1712
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:25,246
He is fighting against common people's problems, how
dare you to say that his mental condition is bad.

1713
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:27,310
You are a biggest fraud in the world.

1714
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,996
Shut up and come.
Listen to me, Vasanthi.

1715
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,150
You will regret later.

1716
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:32,480
My Sweet!

1717
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:35,850
Brother.

1718
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:37,150
Get in.

1719
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:44,350
Hello sir.

1720
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,150
What's happening there, Vasanthi?

1721
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:48,150
They planned to attract MLA.

1722
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:49,850
I send him in the ambulance, safely.

1723
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,416
Now, everything is under my control.

1724
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,980
What is that in your control?

1725
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:56,190
Somebody fooled you, and kidnapped
MLA in the duplicate ambulance.

1726
01:27:56,730 --> 01:28:00,090
If media comes to know about his kidnap,
they will play football with our department.

1727
01:28:00,690 --> 01:28:03,940
Find him immediately,
otherwise I will dismiss you.

1728
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:06,270
Stop the vehicle.

1729
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:10,560
Get down, Veerababu.

1730
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:11,980
Why did she stop here?

1731
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:12,520
Get down.

1732
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:13,900
What Vasanthi...?

1733
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:15,996
After all, for 10 lacs,
will you encounter me, Vasanthi?

1734
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,190
No, somebody kidnapped MLA.

1735
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:20,020
What somebody kidnapped MLA...?

1736
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,040
I told you that, his mental
condition is bad. You did not listen.

1737
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,810
Sorry.

1738
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:26,810
You know about MLA's rivals.

1739
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:28,850
Please help me to catch them.

1740
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,770
Help? You should have asked
me before arresting me.

1741
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:32,980
Please...

1742
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,190
I have few conditions.

1743
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:36,600
What are they?

1744
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:37,810
How can I tell you, suddenly?

1745
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:40,480
Let me think and tell you one by one.
First, release me.

1746
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:43,190
Greetings, brother.

1747
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:45,600
I kidnapped MLA.

1748
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:49,770
Oh my goodness, Abhijeet,
I will there in an hour.

1749
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:51,940
Meanwhile, take care of him.

1750
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:52,980
I am coming.

1751
01:28:53,230 --> 01:28:54,690
We missed Mr. Jacket, again.

1752
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:57,060
Useless fellows.

1753
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:00,650
What is the use, you left the opportunity?

1754
01:29:04,690 --> 01:29:05,900
Can you tell me, sir?

1755
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,650
Who are all rivals to MLA?

1756
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:09,020
How can I say?

1757
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:11,060
There will be around 50000 rivals to him.

1758
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,600
What, 50000?

1759
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:15,770
Yes, everyone who did not vote for
him, is rival to him.

1760
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,060
To find the kidnaper,
should we go to everyone of 50000?

1761
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,100
Cool, I will find him from here itself.

1762
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:23,230
Wait and see.

1763
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:26,770
Hello.

1764
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:28,440
Is it MLA Langa Bangarubabu?

1765
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,980
Hey, whoever it is.

1766
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:30,600
Who are you?

1767
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:31,770
You don't need to know.

1768
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:34,350
MLA Jacket Janakiram is in my custody.

1769
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,900
I will handover him, if you get 10 lacs
to the place where I suggest. Deal ok?

1770
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,190
Hey, who are you?

1771
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:43,350
Is it important,
to know about me or to get MLA?

1772
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:46,100
Ok, where and when should I give money?

1773
01:29:46,190 --> 01:29:47,810
I will call you again.

1774
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:53,770
He is ready to give money,
so he did not kidnap MLA.

1775
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:56,100
So, who is your next doubt.

1776
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,020
Next doubt!

1777
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,190
I want ice cream.
What?

1778
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:01,850
I should think, right?

1779
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,770
Ice cream.
Vanilla.

1780
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,560
Hello.
Sir.

1781
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,980
I got to know where Mr. Jacket is.

1782
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:14,650
What you got to know?
Its Veerababu, called you.

1783
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:17,730
He called you, to clear his doubt on you.

1784
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:21,810
Inform me about every
activity of Veerababu.

1785
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:22,980
Ok, sir.

1786
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:29,310
Hey, buy a Jio sim for him.

1787
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,600
Hey, I got him.

1788
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:38,310
Hey, what are you doing?

1789
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,230
We are playing hide and seek.
Come on, brother.

1790
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:41,326
Should I play hide and seek?
Yes.

1791
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:44,520
I know what to play. I know.

1792
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:46,940
Stop it, brother.

1793
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:49,536
You told us to follow Mr. Jacket's instructions, right?
Ha yes.

1794
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:52,060
He asked us to play hide and seek.

1795
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:53,980
You mistaken us.

1796
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,600
Ok, I am sorry. Where is Mr. Jacket?

1797
01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:59,400
(DRAGONFLY! DRAGONFLY! WHERE WILL YOU RUN?)

1798
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,440
Oh my god.

1799
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,600
Uncle out!

1800
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:04,980
Are you playing games or dramas?

1801
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:06,850
Uncle got angry.

1802
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:09,310
If you don't like this game.
We will play other game.

1803
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:13,560
No other game, I know how to deal with you.

1804
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,400
(GO, GO HORSE! ACTIVE HORSE!)

1805
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:21,850
(GOOD HORSE! BRAVE HORSE!)

1806
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:25,400
(FUNNY HORSE! BAAHUBALI HORSE!)

1807
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,940
(JUMPING HORSE!
GOUTHAMI PUTRA SATHAKARNI HORSE!)

1808
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:31,440
I too know about songs. Come to the matter.

1809
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:34,600
What brother in law told you?
Who is brother in law?

1810
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:38,730
My god, how beautifully acting...

1811
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:42,770
Brother, he is a politician, he can act.

1812
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:45,810
Why you are so stubborn,
fix some percentage.

1813
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,060
Ok, we will fix it.

1814
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:51,850
Buddy take one percent.

1815
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,286
What is he,
he is going for toilet currently?

1816
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:56,020
It is regular, nowadays.

1817
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,060
What, going to toilet?

1818
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:58,600
No, about two percentage.

1819
01:31:58,770 --> 01:31:59,770
Is it?

1820
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,900
Buddy, two for you.

1821
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,770
Again, he is asking for three.

1822
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:10,440
Ok buddy, with respect on you, take three.

1823
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:14,730
My BP is getting raised, with his acts.

1824
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:17,020
You can take tablets, if BP is raised.

1825
01:32:17,230 --> 01:32:21,520
It will not work out,
if you say one percent, two percent.

1826
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,980
Close it, saying five percent.

1827
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:25,310
Five percet...?

1828
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:26,770
We still have 95%, brother.

1829
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,100
Jacket, finally five for you.

1830
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:36,270
Oh dear, I am showing you two
fives, ten percent.

1831
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:37,730
Oh no...

1832
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,270
Hey, Abhijeet.

1833
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:44,600
What happened to him?

1834
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:47,150
He is not moving at all.
Is he alive or not?

1835
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:48,190
Go and check.

1836
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:49,310
Hey!

1837
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,650
My goodness!
Brother, he is fine.

1838
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:56,310
Thank god, he is alive.

1839
01:32:57,690 --> 01:32:58,770
Hey, what's that noise?

1840
01:32:58,810 --> 01:33:00,020
Nothing, brother.

1841
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:05,520
I brought the one who bite his
ear, to take the revenge.

1842
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,600
Abhijeet.

1843
01:33:07,770 --> 01:33:08,310
Brother!

1844
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,400
Everyone will burn it when
they asked to watch it!

1845
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,440
You are the one who is burning on yourself!

1846
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:14,850
Go, bring him.

1847
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:16,270
Please, have it darling.

1848
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:20,270
You have it, darling.

1849
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:25,850
This spoon is in my name.

1850
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:26,770
Enough, dear.

1851
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:28,230
Have it.
No.

1852
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,440
Have it.

1853
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:29,900
Hey.

1854
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:32,940
I am tensed here, do you need dreams now?

1855
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:33,980
Wait.

1856
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,600
Do you need MLA or not?

1857
01:33:36,690 --> 01:33:37,690
My fate!

1858
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:40,480
Listen, for the sake of
MLA am tolerating you.

1859
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,060
I can't, anymore.

1860
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:45,810
Please, cooperate.

1861
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:48,230
Now, my ego is satisfied.

1862
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,400
Let's go.

1863
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:52,150
Hey...

1864
01:33:52,350 --> 01:33:53,440
Stand properly.

1865
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,190
Do this batch kidnapped MLA?

1866
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,190
Hey.

1867
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,350
What?

1868
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,520
He is MLA.

1869
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,350
I know.

1870
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,080
Then, why are you treating him like that?

1871
01:34:01,190 --> 01:34:05,980
If Veerababu comes to know about this,
he will not leave anyone of you.

1872
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:07,230
My god!

1873
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:10,020
My god am scared!

1874
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:12,020
Where should I go?

1875
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,076
Who are you, first of all?

1876
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:16,190
Pushpa's husband.
Pushpa's husband.

1877
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:17,230
Stop it.

1878
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:21,730
Are you Pushpa's husband?
You are saved, go.

1879
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:24,850
I hate myself, I don't want to live.

1880
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,060
Kill me, please.

1881
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:28,310
Hey, stop it.

1882
01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:31,520
How dare you to beat my
brother, in front of me.

1883
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:34,440
Suri, what's the issue with these people.

1884
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,900
Brother, you became matured!

1885
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:38,400
Can men be matured?

1886
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:39,770
Stop nonsense.

1887
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:47,480
You met with accident, went to hospital,
went to coma, became 10year old boy.

1888
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,480
Just now,
you turned back to your actual age.

1889
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:51,496
Hey devil, did your brother-in-law
discharged from hospital?

1890
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,770
He discharged and dead a month ago.

1891
01:34:55,810 --> 01:34:56,850
Is he dead?

1892
01:34:57,270 --> 01:34:58,060
Oh my god.

1893
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,810
Why should we bother about him?
I die every day.

1894
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:03,826
My entire life will be spoiled. Please come
and settle Pushpa's matter, immediately.

1895
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:04,850
Mov.

1896
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:07,560
What? Is it not settled yet?

1897
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,060
How can it be settled, without you?

1898
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:10,770
Let's go, I will see Pushpa.

1899
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:11,270
Brother!

1900
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,270
That's what, I will settle her matter.

1901
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:15,310
Let's go, then.

1902
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:16,400
Hey.

1903
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:24,600
If you don't answer me,
I will kill your brother.

1904
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:27,480
Devil first ask them to leave him.

1905
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,980
I will tell you what ever you want.

1906
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:30,810
What did brother-in-law tell you?

1907
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:34,150
Devil, we both know each
other for about 25years.

1908
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,400
He might have told me many things.
Ask me clearly, what you want.

1909
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,810
That evening you went to hospital.

1910
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:41,520
You met my brother-in-law.

1911
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:44,150
What did my brother-in-law
tell you in secret?

1912
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:48,600
That day early morning at 5 am, cock crowd.

1913
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:49,270
He started it again.

1914
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,650
Then, my wife!

1915
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:57,190
Daddy, I don't want what
cock, dog and cat did.

1916
01:35:57,350 --> 01:36:01,310
I want, what did my
brother-in-law told you in secret.

1917
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:04,270
Listen, it's my hobby to
remember anything in order.

1918
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,850
If you disturb in between, I can't.

1919
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:08,350
Hey, Abhijeet.
Brother.

1920
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,770
What is this,
he is telling it from starting?

1921
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:13,100
Let him say, is it any issue for us.

1922
01:36:13,190 --> 01:36:14,310
He will be tired himself.

1923
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:15,350
You are dead!

1924
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:18,190
You did not catch him,
you people caught by him.

1925
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,900
Ok daddy, you say it as you wish.

1926
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:27,560
That day early morning at
5am, cock has crowd.

1927
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:33,520
Then, my wife wakes me up after having bath
and keeping flowers on her head.

1928
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:34,690
Jasmine flowers or what?

1929
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:35,440
Hey, stop it.

1930
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,190
You say..

1931
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,100
That day early morning at
5am, cock has crowd.

1932
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:45,600
Oh my god, he initiated it again.

1933
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:46,650
Brother.
Haa..

1934
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:49,060
This is the only bad habit he has.

1935
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:53,480
If you disturb in between,
when he is speaking in a flow.

1936
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,600
Now, you all know about his problem.

1937
01:36:56,850 --> 01:37:00,400
So, hold on even if you are
about to cough or sneeze.

1938
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,480
It's a matter of 500 crores.

1939
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,496
Can't you hold on for just half an hour.

1940
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,520
Thank you very much.

1941
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,850
Idiot shut up.

1942
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:08,310
You can start...

1943
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:13,690
That day early morning at
5am, cock has crowd.

1944
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:20,230
Then, my wife wakes me up after having bath
and keeping flowers on her head.

1945
01:37:20,650 --> 01:37:26,690
It was 8am by finishing my
regular chores and bathing.

1946
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:27,230
(SNEEZES)

1947
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:28,730
Oh no..

1948
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:30,830
Sorry bother.
You people are killing me!

1949
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:32,060
He put the knife in my nose.

1950
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:38,940
Hey, do anyone in this world
keep knife in the nose?

1951
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:41,520
It should be kept on the neck.
Why did you put it in the nose?

1952
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:49,690
If you put this knife again in to the nose or
any other hole, I will cut all your organs.

1953
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:56,400
Daddy, I apologise on behalf of everyone.

1954
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:59,020
Please start it again.

1955
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:04,400
That day early morning at
5am, cock has crowd.

1956
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:12,270
Then, my wife wakes me up after having bath
and keeping flowers on her head.

1957
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:19,440
It was 8am by finishing my
regular chores and bathing.

1958
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:27,600
Then, as I switched on the TV, 'beauty of dream
world as has come in front of me to surprise'.

1959
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:29,600
After that...
That is...

1960
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:31,350
After that...

1961
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:36,440
She has come from the heaven to the earth.
My god!

1962
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,650
Brother, Suswagatham movie.

1963
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:40,810
Power star Pawan Kalyan's song.

1964
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:43,440
Damn...!

1965
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:46,310
Brother, please forgive me.

1966
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:50,600
My body shaken by listening to Power
star's song. I beg you, please forgive me.

1967
01:38:50,690 --> 01:38:51,850
Damn...!

1968
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:56,190
Hey, do you think I don't know songs.

1969
01:38:56,310 --> 01:39:01,560
Khaidi No 150, Mr. Chiranjeevi's song,
I can sing like, 'Darling let's do fight'.

1970
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:03,310
But I controlled on myself.

1971
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,190
One should have humanity.

1972
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,600
Why are you laughing?

1973
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:10,370
You can't make him to say it,
even if you tried for entire life.

1974
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,900
How can I make him say it?

1975
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,650
Only one person can help you.

1976
01:39:14,650 --> 01:39:15,940
Hey...
Hey, it's a phone.

1977
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:19,770
Yes buddy, tell me.

1978
01:39:19,810 --> 01:39:21,310
MLA is kidnapped.

1979
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,520
I know, I am searching for him.

1980
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,650
Buddy, I am also...
Hey, don't disturb me.

1981
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:28,730
He disconnected the call.

1982
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:29,940
Try again.

1983
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:36,810
I shouldn't attend his call until
I find MLA, I will switch off.

1984
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:39,020
This time, it is switched off.

1985
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,230
How to express love to her?

1986
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,730
Hey you.

1987
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:49,520
It is not my mistake.
Driver applied a sudden break. Ask him.

1988
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:53,400
Don't apply the break
even at speed breaker.

1989
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:54,020
Sure, madam.

1990
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:58,150
By the way, if sudden break is applied,
you should have move forward.

1991
01:39:58,270 --> 01:40:01,770
How did you come back and kiss her?

1992
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:04,060
Yes, it is a logic.
Logic?

1993
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:07,480
Driver apply the sudden break again,
we will check how is it happened.

1994
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:08,150
Again?

1995
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:09,440
Just shut up.

1996
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:14,190
It was 9am, by getting ready.

1997
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,060
My wife prepared Upma for me.

1998
01:40:16,270 --> 01:40:19,150
At the same time,
Veerababu came to my house.

1999
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:24,770
When I asked, are you in love
with hotel owner's daughter?

2000
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:27,600
He tried to escape saying, nothing brother.

2001
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:34,350
When I forced him, he asked me to place
a SI job for his lover and gave me 10lacs.

2002
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:40,650
I agreed and started from home.

2003
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:42,076
As soon as I come out, one person has come.

2004
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:43,310
Vehicle reached the station.

2005
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,770
The person is...

2006
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:46,730
It's me. Yes, It's me.

2007
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:47,310
Oh no...

2008
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:52,020
If you could give me just 5minutes on that
day, Pushpa's matter would be settled.

2009
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:59,310
My god! What sin I did?

2010
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:03,940
Entire story would be finished in
another minute, I would have saved.

2011
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:09,770
Do you have at least common sense?
Give me your hand.

2012
01:41:09,850 --> 01:41:11,270
Shut up. Turn this side.

2013
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,560
Turn this side.

2014
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:13,480
Shut up.

2015
01:41:13,730 --> 01:41:14,270
Turn.

2016
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,940
If you open these two holes,
I will close them completely.

2017
01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:27,650
That day early morning at
5am, cock has crowd.

2018
01:41:27,690 --> 01:41:29,730
Shit, it is punctured.

2019
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:31,310
Change it immediately.

2020
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:35,150
Am tensed that, MLA's life will be in
risk, as we are getting late.

2021
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:36,270
Cool.. Cool.. Cool..

2022
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:39,850
Mr. Langa Bangarubabu is the only enemy
who wants to kill MLA.

2023
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,690
As MLA is not with, he is safe.

2024
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:48,020
You are telling everything as detective,
but you couldn't tell who the kidnaper is.

2025
01:41:48,980 --> 01:41:49,980
Wait.

2026
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:53,520
MLA met with accident when
he went to meet the minister.

2027
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:59,850
Sir, at any cost MLA sir he should be fine
and should go to the assembly.

2028
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:01,730
Yeah, I got him.

2029
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:02,440
Follow me.

2030
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,060
Where?

2031
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:04,706
I will tell you,
first you remove the dress.

2032
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:05,270
What?

2033
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,496
Don't mistake me.
I am asking you to come in civil dress.

2034
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,520
Oh ok.

2035
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:10,650
You get the vehicle
ready and go to station.

2036
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:11,850
I will call you if needed.

2037
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:12,980
Ok.
Ok madam.

2038
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:18,230
Hello...

2039
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:22,400
To help him, I took 10lacs and came out.

2040
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:23,810
Then, one person came.

2041
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:27,150
Ha, he is the one.
See how he is sitting there.

2042
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:32,480
He came and requested me to
settle the Pushpa's matter.

2043
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:40,560
Then Veerababu gave a correct suggestion as, 'minister is
in serious condition, he must go to hospital immediately'.

2044
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:41,980
Idiot..

2045
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:44,650
I came to hospital directly.

2046
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:48,440
By that time, it is 12.30pm.

2047
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:50,940
You were standing in front of me.

2048
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,400
You made fun of me.

2049
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:54,270
Do you remember?

2050
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:58,060
You told me to explain everything
what is happened inside.

2051
01:42:58,230 --> 01:42:59,600
You took inside, too.

2052
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:01,900
He was sleeping.

2053
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:04,190
He was given oxygen inhalation.

2054
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:05,350
Do you remember it or not?

2055
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:10,480
Do you know what you said,
brother-in-law check who is it.

2056
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:15,400
Then, he slowly opened his eyes.

2057
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:18,770
Oh God...!

2058
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,850
He is born with the cylinder in stomach.
Kill him.

2059
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,520
Please... Please...

2060
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:32,520
You could hold the cough and sneeze,
why can't you hold this too.

2061
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:40,600
I could hold it form the start of
the story, I couldn't hold it more.

2062
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:49,900
You should hold it, if you want 500 crores.

2063
01:43:50,690 --> 01:43:55,980
Even a biggest story Ramayanam
will be narrated in simple way.

2064
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:57,520
This is not that kind of a story.

2065
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:01,560
Please tell it in simple.

2066
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:02,600
He will not.

2067
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:09,480
That day early morning at 5am, cock
cuckooed as Co Co in short cut.

2068
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:11,310
I said it right.

2069
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,850
Hey, what is this?

2070
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:19,020
Sorry.

2071
01:44:19,190 --> 01:44:19,810
Sorry?

2072
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:22,060
It's crime if I do and it's
a dream if you do, is it?

2073
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:26,310
I moved to front,
as the sudden break is applied,

2074
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:29,560
but, why did you turn
aside at the same time?

2075
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:32,560
That means, I know that I
will apply a sudden break.

2076
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:33,230
What?

2077
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,900
Kiss should be wasted, right.

2078
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:35,980
Hey.

2079
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:39,150
Your brother-in-law slowly opened his eyes.

2080
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:41,190
We both were there in front of him.

2081
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:44,940
You were standing on the oxygen
tube, by mistake.

2082
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:46,470
He couldn't catch the breath.

2083
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:49,940
He said, 'idiot, move away from the tube'.

2084
01:44:50,190 --> 01:44:52,310
You moved away in a hurry.

2085
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:55,270
He told you to get out.

2086
01:44:55,690 --> 01:45:01,520
While going out, you insisted to me to
tell you everything, what happened there.

2087
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:04,690
Your brother-in-law asked
me to come close to him.

2088
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,690
I went close and placed
my ear near to his mouth.

2089
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:16,520
He said, I earned a lot of money
but I couldn't earn the dignity.

2090
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:19,980
At the same time, you people opened doors.

2091
01:45:30,770 --> 01:45:33,770
Pushpa, why did you disturb at the end?

2092
01:45:33,850 --> 01:45:36,440
Is it fair kidnapping the groom?

2093
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:37,690
Why did you come here?

2094
01:45:37,810 --> 01:45:39,730
Today is Sunday, new moon.

2095
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:41,650
Are you planning for occult activities?

2096
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:42,600
No,

2097
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:44,286
I am planning for the first night.

2098
01:45:44,310 --> 01:45:45,480
First night?

2099
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,350
Shut all your mouths.

2100
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:49,440
First night.

2101
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,650
First night for you!

2102
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:51,770
No. For you, first night.

2103
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:52,560
For me?

2104
01:45:52,650 --> 01:45:54,270
I mean, for both of us.

2105
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:57,730
Pushpa, how did you know
that Suribabu is here?

2106
01:45:57,940 --> 01:46:00,940
One of my fans is there in your group.

2107
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:01,520
God!

2108
01:46:01,810 --> 01:46:04,480
Pushpa's fan is there in my group?

2109
01:46:05,230 --> 01:46:06,230
Who is that?

2110
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:08,020
You...

2111
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:09,270
Pushpa's...

2112
01:46:09,690 --> 01:46:10,690
Fan...

2113
01:46:11,230 --> 01:46:14,770
Idiot, how can you cheat me?

2114
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:17,690
Brother, my luck, she came here herself.

2115
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:22,350
Please ask her to sign on divorce papers.
So that, I will get rid of my problem.

2116
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:25,440
Hey devil, I need two minutes of time.

2117
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:27,560
No one can go out.

2118
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,480
Then, you go.

2119
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,100
No, I will turn aside, if you want.

2120
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:32,150
Then, We will turn back.

2121
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:33,850
We can also turn back.

2122
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:34,900
Pushpa, come here.

2123
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:39,190
What do you want, to sign on this file?
Concealer or corporater?

2124
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:42,020
It's a small for post
for this huge signature.

2125
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:45,400
Human illegal affairs minister, how is it?

2126
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:47,650
This looks fine.

2127
01:46:47,690 --> 01:46:48,060
Come sign..

2128
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:49,100
Fix it.

2129
01:46:49,150 --> 01:46:50,150
Come sign..

2130
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:53,310
Good, she learned to sign.

2131
01:46:58,650 --> 01:46:59,650
Brother...

2132
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,060
Remove it.

2133
01:47:01,270 --> 01:47:02,270
Speak out.

2134
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:07,850
How much ever precautions we take, one or
the other way somebody is disturbing us.

2135
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:10,060
First tie him.

2136
01:47:10,350 --> 01:47:14,690
What did brother-in-law tell you in secret?

2137
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:22,400
That day early morning at
5am, cock has crowd.

2138
01:47:22,730 --> 01:47:28,310
Then, my wife wakes me up after having bath
and keeping flowers on her head.

2139
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:34,230
It was 8am by finishing my
regular chores and bathing.

2140
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,100
When I switched on the TV,

2141
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:37,190
beauty of dream world as has
come in front of me to surprise.

2142
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:40,190
Fly... Fly... Fly...
Death knell to you...

2143
01:47:40,230 --> 01:47:43,940
I'll take your life easily...

2144
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:50,940
Fly... Fly... Fly...
Death knell to you...

2145
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:54,690
I'll take your life easily...

2146
01:48:08,730 --> 01:48:12,520
He asked me to place a SI job for his lover and gave me 10lacs.
Sorry Mr. Rajamouli.

2147
01:48:12,810 --> 01:48:18,940
I agreed and started from home.

2148
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,100
He said about 500crores money...

2149
01:48:22,150 --> 01:48:23,480
Hey...

2150
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:27,150
Bruce Lee. Jackie Chan.
Tiger shroff Tony Jaa.

2151
01:48:27,230 --> 01:48:29,350
Vasanthi. Open the arm out!

2152
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:31,020
Your foot!

2153
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:35,060
If you would come a minute later,
I would have given you a crore rupees.

2154
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:37,900
Hey, Devil, who is this?

2155
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:38,770
Pushpa?

2156
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:41,650
It's not Pushpa, open your eyes and check.

2157
01:48:44,270 --> 01:48:45,900
Hey, Veerababu.

2158
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:47,520
Brother, you became normal.

2159
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:48,980
Are you alright now?

2160
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:50,826
He is alright,
but these people became abnormal.

2161
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:52,310
Suri, are you here?

2162
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:53,440
You should have call me.

2163
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:55,160
You should have picked the call.
Stop it.

2164
01:48:55,230 --> 01:48:58,400
You all are under arrest,
as you kidnapped MLA.

2165
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:03,270
You all are under arrest,
as you kidnapped MLA.

2166
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:03,900
Wait.

2167
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:04,850
What do you want?

2168
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:05,980
I can make him answer that.

2169
01:49:07,230 --> 01:49:10,600
Brother, the day when accident happened,
I did not meet you at all.

2170
01:49:10,690 --> 01:49:15,060
Veerababu, you came and
met me while I was having breakfast.

2171
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:18,480
You gave me 10lacs to place a police
job, for your lover.

2172
01:49:18,650 --> 01:49:19,650
Do you understand?

2173
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:20,560
Sorry.

2174
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:22,850
Veerababu is nick name of honesty.

2175
01:49:23,020 --> 01:49:26,900
He is right, he may cheat friends,
but he will not cheat lover.

2176
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:27,560
God!

2177
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:32,520
Why did you come here? To solve your
love problem or to solve my problem.

2178
01:49:32,980 --> 01:49:34,900
You have given that 10lacs to Sadhasivam.

2179
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:38,310
I did not give him as
he denied recommending,

2180
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:41,940
so I gave to contractor
Gurunadham, to deal it other way.

2181
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,400
Your matter is clear.

2182
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:46,060
Brother, you did not
meet minister at 12:30pm.

2183
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:47,060
I met him.

2184
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:49,650
I did not tell you about 500crores.

2185
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:57,770
Why not, he told me that, he kept that money at
his old house which is located at Gandhinagar.

2186
01:49:58,850 --> 01:49:59,850
Hey, Yes..

2187
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:02,520
The lord has arrived.

2188
01:50:02,810 --> 01:50:05,850
The earth has raised the umbrella,
filled with stars of the sky.

2189
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:09,100
The lord has given.

2190
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:13,400
A promise sprouting wings of a new hope.

2191
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:19,520
The lord has arrived.

2192
01:50:19,770 --> 01:50:23,020
The earth has raised the umbrella,
filled with stars of the sky.

2193
01:50:23,770 --> 01:50:26,100
The lord has given.

2194
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:30,350
A promise sprouting wings of a new hope.

2195
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,440
I am grateful to you.

2196
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:33,310
Come here.
Brother.

2197
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:37,600
It is difficult, if they ask for percent
from 500crores. So, kill them all.

2198
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:45,810
Brother, have you gone mad?

2199
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:46,850
Hey...

2200
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:50,400
Hey, how dare you calling
a millionaire as mad?

2201
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:54,020
We are not yet sure, whether money
is there in that place or not.

2202
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:58,810
We will kill them all, once we confirm.

2203
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:02,850
Super idea. Location shift.

2204
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,230
Sir, it is like haunting place.

2205
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,940
Yes, it belongs to the Devil from today.

2206
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:17,060
Come in.

2207
01:51:25,730 --> 01:51:26,770
Hey, switch on that light.

2208
01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:31,310
Hey Jacket, where is the money hidden
by my brother in law?

2209
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:35,440
Cock that morning at 5 cuckooed...

2210
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:38,190
Oh no, I salute you Sir. Not all these...

2211
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:43,230
He dragged me into this Cock track 'and
this brother in law shouldn't be let gone.

2212
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:55,560
What is this?

2213
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,060
Hey Abhijit Brother.

2214
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:03,940
Maybe my brother in law murdered somebody, put the
dead body in this box and planned to trap us.

2215
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:06,770
This old man is troubling even after dying.
To hell with him...

2216
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:10,480
Oh no... Brother What?

2217
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:12,900
Money bro, money Money?

2218
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:14,770
Rs.2000 notes...

2219
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:17,770
Will you be on that side or this side.
500 crores, for me...

2220
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:18,850
Hey Devil...

2221
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,520
Hey, your brother in law asked me
to use this money for good deeds.

2222
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:29,150
What, shall I spend this money for Swatch Bharat project,
build bathrooms all over India and sit cleaning those?

2223
01:52:29,190 --> 01:52:30,190
Go away...

2224
01:52:30,230 --> 01:52:34,350
Mistake has happened. Money is gone into this idiot's hands.
Will you be on that side or this side.

2225
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:36,980
And I'm unable to keep the
word given to the Minister Sir.

2226
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:40,770
Look dude, if you put aside word of that
old man, he'd become a ghost and take you.

2227
01:52:40,810 --> 01:52:45,150
Hey, I'm a ghost,
I'm a devil and I'm the God.

2228
01:52:45,190 --> 01:52:46,730
Where is the devil greater than me?

2229
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:49,690
Kill that idiot with the same hands.
Kill him.

2230
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:50,730
Hey devil...

2231
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:54,850
He shouldn't die in your hands but in mine.

2232
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,810
Who cares about which
idiot, kill with your hands.

2233
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:02,770
If you instigate the public, make them
do protests and close the factory,

2234
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:05,810
will your dad pay the 5 crores
to be paid to that owner?

2235
01:53:06,190 --> 01:53:08,980
Hey item,
did you come just for the 5 crores?

2236
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:12,810
Idiot, we are worried thinking you came
for the whole of 500 crores.

2237
01:53:12,940 --> 01:53:14,496
Oh no 500 crores...
Why does this idiot say 5 crores bro?

2238
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:17,690
Hey Abhijit, you are such a great fool.

2239
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:22,730
Brother, they became so shocked for this and what
happens to them knowing about the 1000 crores.

2240
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:24,940
What, 1000 crores?

2241
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:26,060
1000 crores?

2242
01:53:26,230 --> 01:53:27,230
1000 crores?

2243
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:29,440
He's keeping some new twist again.

2244
01:53:29,650 --> 01:53:30,980
What is 1000 crores dude?

2245
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:33,310
Yes bro, act the same like
you don't know anything.

2246
01:53:33,350 --> 01:53:37,230
Hey Jacket, don't get into Cuckoo story
again and say where's that 1000 crores.

2247
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:38,480
You want to escape!

2248
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:39,810
Don't say brother.

2249
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:43,520
Don't say that the details about 1000 crores
are in the file in the hands of that Suri.

2250
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:46,730
Oh no... Is it why you've been roaming
around with that in your hands?

2251
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:48,206
Hey, stop idiot. Pull it guys.

2252
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:49,230

Yes, we shall look into shares later,
put that first into the vehicle.

01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:58,350

Oh no... Catch guys, catch.

2268

Hey, you bent great in matrix style.

2269
01:54:53,230 --> 01:54:54,230
My foot pose...

2270
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:56,786
I'm dying with my waist bent and
why do you overact without helping me?

2271
01:54:56,810 --> 01:54:58,810
Oh no...
How to lift him up?

2272
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:00,650
How do I lift when you're so?

2273
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:02,100
Hey, lift dude.

2274
01:55:02,190 --> 01:55:03,990
Shall I lift from this side?
Lift dude, lift.

2275

Hey, don't leave them.
They broke my nose...

2277
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,150
Hey What?

01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:41,350
What shall I do dude?

2280
01:55:41,730 --> 01:55:42,730
Do one thing.

2281
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:03,900
Hey, my beauty saved us.

01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:07,150
Thank God Thank you God.

2283
01:56:08,150 --> 01:56:10,310

2284
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:13,520
Oh no, I don't know anything.

2285
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:17,810
Brother, I got a great idea.

2286
01:56:17,850 --> 01:56:21,150
I got the phone numbers

01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:24,810
I'll call one by one, wherever is the
phone rings you just shoot there.

2288
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:29,230

Damn...

2296
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:07,560
You trap us. Wait, I'll teach you a lesson.
Lines aren't clear.

2297
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:11,270
Why is this Veerababu calling me?

2298
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:14,060

01:57:23,650 --> 01:57:24,730
Oh no..

2305
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:26,440
Who threw it? I'll shoot, idiot.

2306
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:29,150

01:57:36,690 --> 01:57:37,560

2309
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:42,810
You come behind me and fool me idiots?

2310
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:44,876
I mean, we thought to take
shelter in your shade.

2311
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:46,270
Should I then be in the Sun?

2312
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:46,650
No...

2313
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:47,520
Where's that fellow?

2314
01:57:47,650 --> 01:57:48,440
This guy?

2315
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,940
No, not him but Pushpa's husband.

2316
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:54,270
Oh no...

2317
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:56,560
Only that up there knows about him Sir.

2318
01:57:56,650 --> 01:57:58,690
I'm asking again,
where is Pushpa's husband?

2319
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:02,850
What's that reaction idiot?

2320
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:05,416
I mean, I've bullet smoke allergy
like the cigarette smoke Sir.

2321
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:07,850
Not with words but I'll
hit you with bullets.

2322
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:10,810
Say where is Pushpa's husband.
I don't know sir.

2323
01:58:11,810 --> 01:58:16,310
Don't involve me asking where is Pushpa's
husband, every time. I'm frustrated.

2324
01:58:16,350 --> 01:58:18,770
You are frustrated,
and my base is burning here.

2325
01:58:18,850 --> 01:58:20,690
I'll do the first murder
and open the account.

2326
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:22,900
Not her but please kill me.

2327
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:26,060
Many will go without a lady if
she is killed. Please kill me.

2328
01:58:26,150 --> 01:58:27,850
Ladies first, kill me first.

2329
01:58:28,690 --> 01:58:31,230
Not the lady but I'm a senior
citizen and kill me first.

01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:33,100
No, not him but kill me first.

Hey, stop idiot. You shoot bro.

DGP Sir, I'm the brother
in law of the dead Minister.

2349
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:26,600
Will you give that file?
I'll get you 5 new and fresh files.

2350
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:30,400
Do I look like an LKG kid
to stop crying by giving a chocolate?

2351
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:31,480
What's in this file?

2352

01:59:54,980 --> 02:00:01,310
This is the divorce document written by us in agreement
due to differences in opinions to get separated.

2359
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:02,400
What's this?

2360
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:04,690
I'm asking the same Sir.
What's this, rascals?

2361
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:08,810
Though you are a DGP,

2362
02:00:09,150 --> 02:00:14,100
DGP Sir, you ask without any shame

I'll give 50%, give me the file.

What's me getting a heart attack?

2367
02:00:31,150 --> 02:00:33,786
You'd really get heart attack
if Police gets the money in the Ambulance.

2368
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:36,730
Oh no, I got a heart attack.

02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:52,020
Come brother...

2380
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:54,600
Sir... DGP Sir... Sir, it is cheating.
Come bro.

2381
02:00:54,690 --> 02:00:58,060
He has no heart attack Sir, there's 500
crore property in that Ambulance Sir.

2382
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:00,770
They are playing drama for
that, catch them sir.

2383
02:01:00,810 --> 02:01:02,400
Is it them or you playing drama?

2384
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:09,270
It is as true that 500 crores in that in that
Ambulance as there's 1000 crores in that file.

2385
02:01:09,650 --> 02:01:11,530
Hey, take these and make
them get into the van.

2386
02:01:12,190 --> 02:01:13,440
Move, get into the van.

2387
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:16,060
Sir, here is your bag.

2388
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:18,480
Hey, catch...
Veerababu, love you dear.

2389
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:21,100
Maybe he cheated but
gave us our share dude.

2390
02:01:22,230 --> 02:01:27,770
What giving bro, he threw the banned
old 1000 rupees notes on our face.

2391
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:28,980
Banned notes?

2392
02:01:30,230 --> 02:01:35,100
I could change 499 crores,
50 Lakhs to new currency from 500 crores.

2393
02:01:35,150 --> 02:01:37,100
I couldn't exchange the
balance 50 Lakhs, sorry.

2394
02:01:37,150 --> 02:01:38,440
Your Minister Govardhan...

2395
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,310
Hail Lord Govinda...

2396
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:41,810
you exchange the old notes...?

2397
02:01:42,230 --> 02:01:45,150
Where's the other 499 crores and 50 Lakhs?

2398
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:51,150
That day early morning at
5, the cock cuckooed.

2399
02:01:55,730 --> 02:01:58,400
Though comedy, how can it be
a story without giving an end?

2400
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:01,310
Jacket fulfilled the
word given to Minister.

2401
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:06,230
He did many good deeds
and got the Minister seat.

2402
02:02:08,190 --> 02:02:15,350
As Jacket's seat became vacant, Veerababu contested
there as MLA and won with bumper majority.

2403
02:02:15,810 --> 02:02:20,770
Match got set for Police and politics and as a result
Veerababu and Vasanthi imposed life term family sentence.

2404
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:27,520
Our Pushpa stepped into politics as Corporator and
kicked off her routine public service forever.

2405
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:31,150
And you see yourself how did
Suribabu's story reach the climax

2406
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:35,730
(MARRIAGE CHANTS)

2407
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:49,286
Priest Sir, you wish to
ask anything to my fellow?

2408
02:02:49,310 --> 02:02:50,456
No...
No problem... ask him.

2409
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:51,480
Hey, will you stop?

2410
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:54,600
Priest Sir, you start the chants
and I'll urgently tie the knot.

2411
02:02:54,650 --> 02:02:57,650
You stop dude, always in a hurry.
He wants to ask something and let him ask.

2412
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,440
You are Pushpa's husband, right?

2413
02:03:01,690 --> 02:03:05,060
Yes, I'm Pushpa's husband and
I tied knot in her neck,

2414
02:03:05,100 --> 02:03:06,300
So what?
Hey Krishnaveni...

2415
02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:19,600
(MARRIAGE CHANTS)

2416
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:28,230
Huh, you ruined my marriage and
you are silently reading the chants rascal?

2417
02:03:28,770 --> 02:03:29,560
Hey, Suri...

2418
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:30,880
I'll give an end to your life...
