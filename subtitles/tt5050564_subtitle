00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,930
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,030
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,460
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

4
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,340
How will you take me in?

5
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,140
There is a secret passage that goes
to the dungeons. My vizier told me.

6
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,780
We will slip through there
without anyone realizing.

7
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,040
Don’t give in, son! Be strong!

8
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,400
They will test your will to the limits.

9
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,860
What more can they do to me?

10
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,430
I do not care about myself...

11
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,560
...I wonder what they are doing
to that innocent boy.

12
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,600
They might have even killed him.

13
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,280
Look, young man...

14
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,620
...if your body is in this dungeon...

15
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,840
...the thing that awaits you
is much more than death itself.

16
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,960
If you are so sure about what will happen to us...

17
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,400
...you must know those infidels well.

18
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,900
Because I know them so well,
I am in this dungeon for 17 years.

19
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,800
How did you bear this for so long?

20
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,080
With love.

21
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,960
Don’t stop even for a moment
thinking about the One...

22
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,360
...who enlightens the darkness in you
when you close your eyes.

23
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,760
-Are you a hunter.
-I am the hunt this time.

24
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,320
The new home will be a new and joyous life
for all of us. Especially for us.

25
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,220
-Does Aleppo have everything?
-It has everything.

26
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,880
When we reach there, it will be complete.

27
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,900
We will go and we will wed.

28
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,360
This is my promise to you.

29
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
Aykiz?

30
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,440
Let me see?

31
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,960
It is a deep wound.

32
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,300
Thank you.

33
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,960
Aykiz...

34
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680
...I was presumptuous.

35
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,900
I broke your heart.
But believe me, it was not my intention.

36
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,020
When you talked like that
about Ertugrul...

37
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,580
Aykiz, there is nothing
in my hand except my dreams and hopes.

38
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,140
It’s only my hope that keeps me alive.

39
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,160
If I lose it, I cannot live anymore.

40
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,780
You cannot sooth your pain
by hurting others, Gokce.

41
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,180
But do not despair so much.
My problem is not you.

42
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,800
I thought that as we near Aleppo
I would be relieved...

43
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,280
...I would be joyous with
seeing Turgut again.

44
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,860
But now there is a shadow
casting over my heart.

45
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,220
It’s like I’m not getting closer
but away from my loved one.

46
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,030
I keep dreaming about our memories.

47
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,140
Don’t tire your heart in vain, Aykiz.

48
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,220
Over all the hardships and
sorrows we go through...

49
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,560
...your love is like a flower
that heralds the spring.

50
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,900
Ertugrul’s love made you a poet.

51
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,880
May God bless us all.

52
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,560
I only want to meet Turgut safe and sound,
that is enough for me.

53
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,000
Come on.

54
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,640
I am hungry as a bear, Hatun.

55
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,420
Can’t you hurry up a bit?

56
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,880
I am coming, my Bey.

57
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,960
I have prepared your favorite meal.
It has been a while since we ate alone.

58
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,020
-May it be healthy, Gundogdu.
-Thank you, Hatun.

59
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,180
May it be healthy.

60
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,940
Hatun, I’m engaged with the matters of our tribe.

61
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,680
You are right, Gundogdu.
You are like the Bey of the tribe right now.

62
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,960
It’s not easy to handle all this.

63
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,360
May God give you strength.

64
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,600
-Come on! In the name of God. Please.
-In the name of God.

65
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,320
Do I have permission, Gundogdu?

66
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,180
Gundogdu.

67
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,900
What do you want?

68
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,760
Control yourself, Gundogdu.
Don’t do anything you might regret.

69
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,460
You stay away from this, Selcan Hatun.
There are things you don’t know.

70
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,160
Yes...

71
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,680
...these are the things
that happened, my Bey.

72
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,320
But as you have opened your eyes,
nothing is important anymore...

73
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,920
...they will all pass away,
if God permits.

74
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,900
Now, even if all hell breaks loose,
we can put it out with our hearts, my Bey.

75
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,740
As long as we fight shoulder on shoulder,
nothing can defeat us.

76
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,060
You have always stood by me, Deli Demir.

77
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,040
You have always supported me in any difficulty.

78
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,800
You are more than a brother to me.

79
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,100
When you talk about brotherhood, my Bey...

80
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,300
...you, I, Kurdoglu...

81
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,840
...Alpsungur.

82
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,980
Yes, we once were.

83
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,400
Look, we still are so but…

84
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,800
The older the friendship, the stronger the ties, my Bey. Old friends like you and I.

85
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,220
Did you see Kurdoglu? He could not hit
a bear in front of him in the old times.

86
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,700
As he gets older, his eyes started
seeing better than a hawk, God bless.

87
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,740
This man… the man I call as my uncle…
the man that our Shah calls his blood brother…

88
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,360
But what did he do?
He tried to kill our Shah.

89
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,980
The matter is not like you think,
Gundogdu.

90
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,980
-First you have to listen to me.
-What will you tell me? What?

91
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,860
How you panicked when I told you
that you secretly went into the tent?

92
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,220
Or how you went to finish off the job
in the middle of the night? Which one?

93
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,400
What are you saying, Gundogdu?

94
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,600
I went to save Suleyman Shah from
the fury of the rabid son of Baybora.

95
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,340
I saved our Bey at the last second.

96
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,900
Moreover it was you who warned me
by telling me the tear in the tent.

97
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,180
It was Bozok who went
into the tent that night.

98
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,940
I went after him so that he wouldn’t be able
to complete his will.

99
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,320
And...

100
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,000
...I just came to congratulate you.

101
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,160
Mother Hayme told me.

102
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,000
I came here to say how happy I’m for our nephew.

103
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,860
Everyone in the tribe is talking about that.

104
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,460
Did Suleyman Shah,
our father heard it as well?

105
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,300
What did he say?

106
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,940
He was the most happy one.
Suleyman Shah was overjoyed with...

107
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,360
...the news of a grandson.

108
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,220
Anyway...

109
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,820
...I said what I came to say.
I should not bother you anymore.

110
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,420
Everything happened as you expected,
Ertugrul Bey.

111
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,520
Yes, it did.

112
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,840
They've become prey while they were the hunters,
with God’s permission.

113
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,720
But the situation is more complex
than we thought.

114
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,500
If Sahabeddin’s most trusted maid
whom he sent for me is a traitor...

115
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,880
...the vizier is caught in the trap.

116
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,520
If a lion is caught in a trap
even the coyotes nurse a grudge.

117
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,820
Whatever it takes, we do have to save him.

118
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,220
I will be gone for a while, Ertugrul Bey.

119
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,720
Is this the right time, Afsin Bey.

120
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,800
Will you be leaving us alone
in this fight?

121
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,720
Ertugrul Bey, I know that you wonder
who I am, how far I can reach and...

122
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,620
...where my roots are. I will answer
all your questions and more in time.

123
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,520
But now, we have to pass through a bridge
that is thinner than a hair and...

124
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,900
...sharper than a sword. I ask for
one thing and that is for you to trust me.

125
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,260
We fought side by side, Afsin Bey.
We have the merit of a war between us.

126
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,360
I trust you.

127
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,000
Tomorrow you should go to the Turkmen
carpet man in the market, Ertugrul Bey.

128
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,440
His name is Aykutluk.
He will help you in every way he can.

129
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,600
And I will enter through
the gates of hell for Turgut and Yigit.

130
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,900
Thank you.

131
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,400
Where did those men come out of?
How could you not see them, Aftalia?

132
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,260
He didn’t have time to inform anyone.

133
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,120
It is clear that he became suspicious
and prepared for it in advance.

134
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,200
But how could you not notice
those two goat herders while walking?

135
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,740
Do you have an explanation for this?

136
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,140
I could not see, Commander Titus,
that is why I escaped in the last minute.

137
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,020
Just like you failing against
Ertugrul every single time...

138
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,720
...I failed to notice his warriors.

139
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,480
You should understand me very well in this
manner as you are much more experienced.

140
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,800
Stop! What are you doing?

141
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,860
We are all like the apostles
fighting for God’s sheep.

142
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,220
If we don’t trust each other, Jerusalem
can only be a far-reaching dream for us!

143
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,700
Moreover, when Sahabeddin
is killed tomorrow...

144
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,400
...Ertugrul will only be like a sewer rat
walking around the streets of Aleppo.

145
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,000
Then it’s up to your personal pleasure
to decide what you will do to him.

146
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,980
You caused all this!

147
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,640
When will you stop being a stubborn brat?
You don’t care for anyone.

148
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,480
Not your father, nor your tribe!

149
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,340
Look at the state of this tribe!
It is cracking up!

150
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,180
Winter is coming and we don’t even
know where to go! Open your eyes!

151
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,180
Open your eyes!

152
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,080
How will this tribe stand strong,
Ertugrul? How?

153
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,360
You are lying, Ertugrul.

154
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,400
The eagle is in the cage.
Now it is the wolf’s turn.

155
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,920
Be the sultan of my heart,
the mother of my children...

156
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
...and my companion till the end.

157
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,340
When I could not even become
the sultan of the palace I was born in...

158
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,980
...I cannot be the sultan of your heart.

159
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,700
Great God, Creator of the heavens and earth!
I wended my way to you…

160
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,120
my aim is to set off for a new path.

161
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,660
You are the owner of both the path and the range.

162
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,120
May You bless us at the end of this road.

163
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,860
My request from you is not the throne,
not the crown or being the possessor.

164
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,400
I have set off with your name and
what lies in my heart is...

165
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,020
...to exalt your name on this path.

166
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,380
My aim of using my sword is to make it
the servant of the scales of justice.

167
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,760
Oh God! If I ever happen to think
or feel and lose my path...

168
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,420
...lead me back to my path
by the ones who represent justice.

169
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,300
On this path in which I have set off
to exalt your name...

170
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,040
...prevent me from thinking of the earthly life...

171
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,220
...prevent me from following Satan and
prevent me from getting embarrassed.

172
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,360
Oh God! Let me and my descendants
serve for your purpose.

173
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,560
Let me and my descendants
close our eyes as martyrs.

174
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,460
Hamza.

175
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,020
Yes, my Bey?

176
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
Take this and load it to the camel.

177
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,100
Look, Gundogdu.
His little feet will be wearing these.

178
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,960
With time our son will grow and
be a valiant man, just like his father.

179
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,760
Your heart and mine is beating
right here now.

180
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,420
Everything we have, all our hopes,
our happiness is here now.

181
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,820
He will be our life, our blood,
future of our progeny.

182
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,420
You will see that
all troubles will be left behind.

183
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,260
The new homeland will be
a new world for us.

184
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,140
If God permits, Hatun, if God permits.

185
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,000
Let us complete
this migration journey first.

186
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,680
Come on, I have some business to
attend to, you should get ready as well.

187
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,720
Father?

188
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,960
We ran away for so long...

189
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,340
...we faced so many troubles...

190
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,280
...we went through so much...

191
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,700
But at the end,
we could not protect Yigit.

192
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,560
There is nothing we can do
but pray, father.

193
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,260
Look at me.

194
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,740
I cannot even move.

195
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,640
We will find a way in the end, Halime.

196
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,120
God will surely open up a blessed path
in front of us in time.

197
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,280
Ertugrul Bey promised me.

198
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,220
He will not let Yigit and Turgut Alp
be captive in enemy hands.

199
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,260
He will not, right, father?

200
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,440
Your wound is very serious. I beg you,
don’t distress yourself so much, Halime.

201
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,160
There is a Turkmen carpet man
around here with the name of Aykutluk.

202
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,640
Do you know his place?

203
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,840
Wake up! Wake up!

204
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,160
Wake up!

205
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,320
Be patient, my girl, Leila, be patient.

206
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,360
Do not throw yourself
into those dark wells once again.

207
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,440
May God help you.

208
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,740
-Didn’t she eat?
-No.

209
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,360
Today will be a difficult day
for all of us.

210
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,420
We do not know how it will end.

211
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,860
No news about our vizier
shall reach Leila Sultan, do you understand me?

212
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:16,460
As you wish. We will of course be careful.
But, how can something like this be?

213
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,800
How can our great vizier,
Sahabeddin Tugrul...

214
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,880
...whom no one can suspect his honesty
and righteousness be put on trial?

215
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,840
You are right. We don’t know with
what kind of a slander he was imprisoned.

216
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,140
The only thing we can do for him
is to pray God. You may leave.

217
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,860
God! God! God!

218
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,440
God! God! God!

219
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,260
God! God! God!

220
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,060
Welcome, Ertugrul.

221
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,480
Those mad men of ours have been giving
the good news of your coming.

222
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,160
Are all those mad men, beggars and
drunkards your comrades?

223
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,460
When mayors are being bought
and sold in the market...

224
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,860
...we work with mad men
in this life or death market.

225
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,680
We need to rescue
the vizier from the dungeon.

226
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,740
We need at least one week, my lad.

227
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,520
We need to contact the guards in
the dungeon, arrange their schedule.

228
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,860
Besides, Sahabeddin has his trial today.

229
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,580
In the Muslim world the balance of justice
is not that crooked yet.

230
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,680
We should not lose hope from God.
We should wait for the outcome.

231
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,360
What if it is crooked?

232
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,700
What will we do then?

233
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,840
If betrayal harms the justice...

234
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,220
...then our swords will bring those ones
to the right path.

235
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,440
But, Nasir...

236
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,800
...this is dangerous.

237
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,080
Judge Effendi!

238
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,460
You never thought of any danger while
pouring your belt with gold-filled sacks.

239
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,120
You were saying the vizier is as good as
dead. Why do you tremble like a leaf now?

240
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,660
And...

241
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,180
...think well, Judge Effendi...

242
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,140
...after the issue of the
vizier is done...

243
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,980
...his highness Melik will need
consultants like you beside him.

244
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,340
Can you really do this, Nasir?

245
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,860
Of course.

246
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,640
You are very important for me,
Judge Effendi.

247
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,220
It is not easy to find a man
that can be bought so easily in Aleppo.

248
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,600
On behalf of Emirate  of Aleppo,
Melik El Aziz.

249
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,060
In the name of God; The Embodiment of Justice,
The Retaliator...

250
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,460
...The All-Prevailing One and The Beneficent...

251
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,640
...we shall commence the trial of  Emirate
of Aleppo Vizier, Sahabeddin Tugrul.

252
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,320
The accusations are murder,
disobedience of an order...

253
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,520
...breach of confidence, betrayal of trust
to the city of Aleppo...

254
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,000
...and the Muslim world.

255
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,340
I am one of the private guards of
Sahabeddin Tugrul...

256
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,440
...he ordered me to provide him with
a highly effective poison.

257
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,240
I did as I was ordered.

258
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,220
I saw the people who tried to kill the
Kayi envoy with the vizier in the market.

259
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,660
The vizier was giving something to them
in a pouch. I am sure that it was gold.

260
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,620
I am a trader, the vizier forced me...

261
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,160
...he used me as a tool for his trade business...

262
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,640
...in Antioch, the Earldom of the Crusaders.

263
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,580
Sahabeddin Tugrul, you heard
the accusations.

264
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,980
Is there anything you wish to say?

265
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
I deny all what has been said.

266
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,500
The people speaking here are
false witnesses that were paid to lie.

267
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,160
This is the council of the rights and truths.

268
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,820
These eyes distinguish the truth from the lie...

269
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,120
...as they distinguish black from white
with the permission of God.

270
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,820
You do not need to worry.

271
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,100
Call in the last witness.

272
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,100
God send you to us, sister Ummulhayr.
We were going to send a message to you.

273
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,620
-We have a problem.
-Peace be upon you.

274
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,660
-And peace be upon you.
-Welcome, sister. What happened?

275
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,740
You talked about an important matter.

276
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,840
I do not know whether you heard about
what happened to our vizier.

277
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,140
Sahabeddin Tugrul is
an honest person inside and outside.

278
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,200
He is a valuable statesman
Great God has bestowed upon us.

279
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,000
Everyone knows that he had been doing
his duties in a competent manner.

280
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,120
He is going through a difficult test...

281
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,200
...May God the Opener, the Judge help him.
-Amen.

282
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,720
Leila has learned about her uncle.

283
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,440
She is devastated since she learned that
it was her brother who arrested him.

284
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,700
I worry that she may fall ill once again
and turn her back on life.

285
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,800
Poor girl, she was recovering
quite well recently, wasn’t she?

286
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,360
Yes. She had recovered with
the support of our vizier but...

287
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,720
How can we of help, sister?

288
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,940
I...

289
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,100
...if it is possible...

290
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,380
...she may be refreshed with
a conversation with our Sheikh Effendi.

291
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,680
I just thought that she could have
a relief with his divine light...

292
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,820
...before she gets worse.
-You thought well.

293
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,180
I shall inform our Sheikh
and tell you his decision.

294
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,020
May God bless you.
I heard that you have a problem as well.

295
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,800
We have visitors in our lodge.

296
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,400
They are also going
through difficult tests.

297
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,580
A young girl like Leila is wounded.
The doctor did all he could but...

298
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,200
...the wound is getting worse.
The cure is in God’s hands.

299
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,380
If the palace physician checks her,
maybe he can find a remedy.

300
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,760
Of course, I will immediately
tell him to visit you tomorrow.

301
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,100
The girl’s condition
is an emergency, sister.

302
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,200
Will you swear on the Qur’an
that there won’t be any lies...

303
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,840
...nor contradictions about
what you will tell us?

304
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,280
I do, my Effendi.

305
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,000
Tell everything as you
told me before, my girl...

306
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,800
...and do not be afraid of anyone.
What happened in that room that day?

307
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,140
The vizier and I went into
the room the killer was in, Effendi.

308
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,920
Was there anyone else who knew that room?

309
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,980
What did you see when you went in?

310
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,300
The man...

311
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,820
...was lying down.
He started to tremble...

312
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,880
...and his mouth foamed up.

313
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,000
He was poisoned…

314
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,200
He…

315
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,820
...he died in the arms of my vizier.

316
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,960
You may leave, my girl.

317
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,080
We have heard enough.

318
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,480
The decision has been made.

319
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,360
The physician has completed
his examination.

320
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,200
You were wise to inform us.

321
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,480
The wound is infected,
her condition is not well.

322
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,140
-I have given her a small medical treatment.
-May God bless you.

323
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,700
But we cannot do much here.

324
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,380
She needs to be looked after in the palace
and treated with special medicine.

325
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,000
We can take her to the palace. If her
condition requires it, we shall abide.

326
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,760
Physician, can you tell us what to do
so that we can treat her here?

327
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,760
I don’t find it in my heart
to let her out of my sight.

328
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Her situation is critical,
she may not come out of this alive...

329
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,040
...we did whatever can be done here,
we shall do the same in the palace.

330
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,280
But only God knows
what the outcome will be.

331
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,000
You can be rest assured, Effendi.
Your daughter is entrusted in me.

332
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,780
I will personally take care of her.

333
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:14,880
Ummulhayr Hanim is my sister.
She will look after your daughter well...

334
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,280
...in the palace and she was also
the governess of El Aziz and his sister.

335
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,320
Sultan Aziz is like her son.
If God permits, there'll be no problem...

336
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,660
...you can be rest assured.
