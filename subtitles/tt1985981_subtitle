1
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,169
Due to recession unemployment is
spreading like cancer..

2
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,092
In many countries.

3
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,852
Bank of England's chief Merlyn
drops economic bombshell.

4
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,652
Everyone's crisis could become
worse than the great depression.

5
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,504
We end today's show with President
Barack Obama's words on global crisis.

6
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,627
He says, "These are hard times."

7
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,802
"There will be more jobs lost,
more of closures and more pain."

8
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:18,741
Hi, you have reached Jerry Patel.

9
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,831
If you're my landlord,
I've already sent the money.

10
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:22,749
If you're my parents,
please send me some money.

11
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,416
If you're my friends,
you owe me money.

12
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,835
And if you are a girl, don't worry.

13
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:27,253
I have plenty of money.

14
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,643
Where are you going, Jasmeet?

15
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,313
Did you hear?

16
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,682
They just sacked Jasmeet.

17
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,649
I think they're
picking on you brown guys.

18
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,685
You will be the first to walk
the gallows in this recession.

19
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,485
Your parents are from Bhatinda.

20
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,400
You live in South Hall.

21
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,318
And I'm brown?

22
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,704
- That's racist man.
- Exactly.

23
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,295
Nicky boy...

24
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,756
Big day.

25
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,639
'Finally! At least someone
remembered my birthday.'

26
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,726
Here's your bonus.

27
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,811
Thanks, Mr. Weisswork.

28
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,772
Spend that bonus wisely.

29
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,228
Hey, Paula. I'll pay you
by the end of the month.

30
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,445
Whatever.

31
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,656
Hey, kiddo. You're not
allowed to skate in here.

32
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,696
Burglary on exit four.

33
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,577
Kid on a skateboard
heading your way.

34
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,612
Jerry, watch your position.

35
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,323
- I'm on it.
- Let's go.

36
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:22,428
Give me the bag.

37
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,225
Medicines.

38
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,435
I swear my grandma needs these.

39
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,688
Can't breathe without them.

40
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:31,649
Please let me go.

41
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,905
- Punch me.
- What?

42
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,323
Punch me and run.

43
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,368
On the face, you idiot..

44
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,489
I was ordered to fire
one man from my team today.

45
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,239
You made my job easier.

46
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,662
Give me your badge.

47
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,800
Bye, Jerry...

48
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,423
That's mall property.

49
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,633
Get off right now.

50
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,472
Duffer.

51
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,542
What's up, Graig.

52
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,343
Surprise.

53
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,464
Oh no.

54
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,593
No, guys.
The surprise isn't for him.

55
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,310
False alarm.

56
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,642
<i>Guys, surprise.</i>

57
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,859
Come on. He's here.

58
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,399
Surprise.

59
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,696
What a party!

60
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,649
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Thank you.

61
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,319
I have been planning your party..

62
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,486
For the past two days.

63
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,487
- It got wasted on him.
- It's okay, Rads.

64
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,456
This is awesome. Thank you.

65
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,658
I got it for you.

66
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,792
At least he brought something.

67
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,454
- You know, Nick..
- Happy birthday, my brother..

68
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,297
From a hotter mother.

69
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,507
Don't mess with him.

70
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,549
When Nick came to college,
Jerry was his senior.

71
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:28,304
And when Nick graduated then
also Jerry was his senior.

72
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,264
Since then, they've
been living together.

73
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,477
They share everything.

74
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,518
Except for responsibilities,
bills and rent.

75
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,525
And then, thank God for that.

76
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,479
But I tolerate Jerry because..

77
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,568
If it wasn't for him,
then three years ago..

78
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,613
Nick would have faced
some problems in meeting me.

79
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,479
Nine o'clock check.

80
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,604
I have already noticed.

81
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:21,694
She is waiting for someone.

82
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,486
Sorry honey I am late. Sorry.

83
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,322
- Yeah, but look at her, J.
- Forget it.

84
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,569
HOW?

85
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,454
Alcohol.

86
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,323
Perfect.

87
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:38,295
Jessica. Send your finest bottle of
Chardonnay to that Indian girl there.

88
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,621
Sure.

89
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,340
Give me the 200 pounds.

90
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,800
Why are you wasting money?

91
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,386
And anyway, she is with someone.

92
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,545
She is with a foreigner.

93
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,430
This will go on for
two-three months, maximum.

94
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,299
As soon her parents find out..

95
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,467
They will get her
married to some boring..

96
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,390
Microsoft techie type guy..

97
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,605
Who has more money and less hair.

98
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,813
Think of it, J.

99
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,433
If I don't go to her..

100
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,980
How will she know
what God has sent for her?

101
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,353
I am the total package, J.

102
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,698
Sorry, Superman.
Your bottle got turned down.

103
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,284
- What?
- Your package got rejected.

104
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,449
By the way, Nick. You are right.

105
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,413
How will she know what
God has sent for her?

106
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,249
What are you thinking about?

107
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,744
That girl's future lies
in your hands. Go get her.

108
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,957
Go.

109
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,588
And listen, don't
come back empty-handed.

110
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,466
He'll get bashed up.

111
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,349
If you spend all the
time with your brother..

112
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,646
Then how will the other
boys get a chance? - Excuse me.

113
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,732
- Do you know him?
- No.

114
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,237
That's what I am here to change.

115
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:48,323
Just tell me are you
going to marry him?

116
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,861
Please leave us alone.

117
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,369
If you're not going to marry him..

118
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,329
Then let me take you out to
dinner tonight. - That's it.

119
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,369
Brian.

120
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:04,874
I am 6 ft., and you look 5 ft. 8
we will look great together.

121
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,375
I don't believe this guy.

122
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,216
Tell him to stop speak in Hindi.

123
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,428
Brian, that's it.

124
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,798
After we get married,
we'll have a house in Hampton..

125
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,348
Two cars, two children.
And a doggy.

126
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,894
The perfect life.

127
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,889
How many girls have you
tried this stunt with?

128
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,357
Are you flirting with him?

129
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,394
Honestly, I'm a very boring person.

130
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,771
No one inspired me to
resort to such madness.

131
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,277
You are the first.

132
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,448
Brian.

133
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,577
Brian, what are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

134
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,201
"What's wrong with me?"
What's wrong with you?

135
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,331
What are you doing with
the poor guy? He's bleeding.

136
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,798
Radhika, whose side are you on?

137
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,259
You know, you are a witch.

138
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,517
Talk respectfully.

139
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:00,933
She is my sister-in-law.

140
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,354
Losers.

141
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,898
One day this will
make a great flashback.

142
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,273
That was the first and last time..

143
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,944
When Jerry did
something nice for me.

144
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:14,283
Don't waste beer.

145
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,286
- Come with me.
- Pathetic.

146
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,739
Where are we going?

147
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,582
I'm tired of tolerating
your attitude and tantrums.

148
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,960
It's always "Do this, do that".

149
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,453
What the hell, Nick!

150
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,376
- First of all this party..
- Rads, shut up.

151
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,508
I was told that this
is very rare and unique.

152
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,882
But not more than you.

153
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,393
I have never come across anyone..

154
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:45,432
- More stubborn, tall and beautiful..
- There is, Nick.

155
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:46,854
I know many of them.

156
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,852
What are you doing? Will
you marry just about anyone?

157
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,069
Don't be lazy.

158
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,529
You can do better than this.

159
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,365
Focus.

160
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,781
Do you want to spend your
entire life with Jerry or me?

161
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:07,166
- Radhika Awasthi, will you marry me?
- No, no, no.

162
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,925
- Nick Mathur.
- No, no, no. Say no.

163
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,543
Yes.

164
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,938
Come on, J. Look here.

165
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,744
Jignesh. Jignesh. Get up.

166
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,539
Not, Jignesh. It's Jerry, mother.

167
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,246
Fifteen years ago I
changed that name..

168
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,792
When I boarded the plane.

169
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,381
Get used to it, mother.

170
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,793
I am Jerry.

171
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,586
Jignesh is dead.

172
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,171
Really, mother. It's
not that difficult.

173
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,843
Jignesh turned to Jerry.

174
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,466
Jerry is Jignesh.

175
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,017
Yes, mother.

176
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,307
Yes, mother. I bought a car.

177
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,975
That too a convertible.

178
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:11,188
Your son drives to the
office breathing fresh air.

179
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,741
"Let it be. Let it be. Let it be."

180
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,536
"Let there be a twist in the story."

181
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:30,787
"I have this right.
Give me a chance, life."

182
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:34,961
- I love her, J.
- I love her, too.

183
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,171
Shut up.

184
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,384
I don't care what
problems the two of you have.

185
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,628
Sort it out.

186
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,970
The problem is with you, Nick.

187
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,549
Whenever she looks at
you she imagines a house.

188
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,597
She imagines the
Country Club membership.

189
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,181
A chauffeur-driven car.

190
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,813
Private education for her children.

191
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,273
I don't think you're her boyfriend.

192
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,899
She thinks you are a LIC agent.

193
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,610
She doesn't see a house,
but our house.

194
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,488
Not her children, but
the future of our children.

195
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,402
This is our dream.

196
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,401
So for God's sake, brother..

197
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,951
Don't ruin it.

198
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,403
LIC agent?

199
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,538
What am I in your life?

200
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,076
An ATM card with unlimited credit.

201
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,793
Oh yes, I just remembered.

202
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,163
The debit card is exhausted.

203
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,539
Deposit some money.

204
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,510
You know you are being
laid off when your boss says..

205
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:24,721
"We need to talk" or
"Times are tough" or..

206
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,393
Nick, this company
cannot afford you..

207
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,762
Due to the current economy.

208
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,354
I am sorry.
We'll have to let you go.

209
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,311
But just yesterday
Mr. Weisswork gave me a bonus.

210
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,350
And that's why the
company has fired him as well.

211
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,443
- And who are you?
- Your new boss.

212
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,772
Sorry, ex-boss.

213
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,786
Nick. Nick.

214
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,787
Are you fine?

215
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,418
That bonus.. spend it wisely.

216
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,049
Do you know anything
about DBS return policy?

217
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,376
You will get one week off in a year.

218
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,836
No bonus.

219
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,550
If you come late,
your salary will be deducted.

220
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,427
You will have to laugh
at the boss's jokes.

221
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,508
And yes,
you do have knowledge about..

222
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,260
PowerPoint and Excel, don't you?

223
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,808
Ma'am, I don't think you
have read my resume properly.

224
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,977
I am not applying for
a typist's job.

225
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,399
This is a really bad phase.

226
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,938
Tomorrow you might
not get this as well.

227
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,526
Sorry, I am
over-qualified for this job.

228
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,732
Who is behind you?

229
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,197
Who is this gentleman?

230
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,987
Madam, I don't need a
single holiday in a year.

231
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,451
I don't want a bonus.

232
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,034
I will laugh at the boss's jokes.

233
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:32,454
In fact, I will amuse him.

234
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,127
He will teach me PowerPoint
and Excel.

235
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,463
You can teach me some small things.

236
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,249
So, do I get the job?

237
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,253
I am sorry, but you are
under-qualified for this job.

238
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,129
- Say it.
- What is your problem?

239
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,926
Fine, I am
over-qualified for this job.

240
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,925
But my friend is perfect
for this job.

241
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,597
Please leave, gentlemen.

242
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,844
This interview is over.

243
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,596
By the way, madam, what
are your qualifications?

244
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,144
- Tell us.
- Get out of my office.

245
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,734
Fine. At least tell
us your measurements.

246
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,520
Get out right now.

247
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,116
They are very
popular hot destinations.

248
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,542
Nick, I think we should
get the bookings done soon.

249
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,287
Otherwise we won't get tickets later.

250
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,503
Look.

251
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,000
'How do I tell her
that I don't have money..'

252
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,504
'..to even take the subway?'

253
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,882
'Just give me a hint..'

254
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,394
'..and I will steal the ring
from her finger in some dark alley.'

255
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,561
'People get mugged all the time.'

256
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,809
Nick, this gown is perfect, isn't it?

257
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,186
The price tag's much more beautiful.

258
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,688
It's a Valentino, my
favorite designer.

259
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,151
'Promise me that while
stealing the ring..'

260
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,744
'..you won't hurt her.'

261
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,120
'I can try, but I won't promise.'

262
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,419
'Forget it. I'll try something.'

263
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,255
Rads, we are blindly doing
everything that others do.

264
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,040
What? - I mean a fake,
over-the-top wedding..

265
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,668
And then a fairytale honeymoon.

266
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,338
These things give one such
high expectations that..

267
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,472
Real life just can't match up.

268
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,599
That's why marriages breakup.

269
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,180
'And Nick Mathur hits that
for <i>a</i> six.'

270
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:21,902
'Don't go out of the crease
and bat. You will get out.'

271
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:23,819
I agree.

272
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,773
A reception at a five-star
hotel and hours of sitting..

273
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,195
On those stupid stools,
while we keep smiling for hours.

274
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,409
Yes.

275
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,616
And, Radhika,
what about your father..

276
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:34,954
Who will run after the
car like a lunatic saying..

277
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:36,244
"..My daughter, my daughter?"

278
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,537
That.. think.

279
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,623
My God! I can actually see that.

280
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,911
Rads, shall we run
away and get married?

281
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,164
I love it.

282
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,757
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

283
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,759
- Okay. So a small ceremony.
- Super.

284
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,505
And then a long exotic honeymoon.

285
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,473
Just you and me, alone.

286
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,841
For a change.

287
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,218
And then as soon <i>as</i> we return..

288
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,765
I'll redecorate the entire house.

289
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,312
French windows there.

290
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,772
A bar on that side.

291
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:00,890
A study for you upstairs.

292
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,438
And a king-size master bedroom.

293
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,483
Life is just gonna be perfect.

294
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,445
The poor girl doesn't know that..

295
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,703
Our apartment is going
to be redecorated anyway.

296
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:18,742
"We would watch films.
Sing few songs."

297
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:23,870
"What happened to those nights when
we used to instantly fall asleep?"

298
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:28,593
"We would watch films.
Sing few songs."

299
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:33,510
"What happened to those nights when
we would instantly fall asleep?"

300
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:38,228
"When we used to fail
and face the brunt together."

301
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:42,766
"When we used to fail and
face the brunt together."

302
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:47,769
"We didn't have a penny,
yet we would somehow dare to."

303
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,651
"What happened to those nights when
we used to instantly fall asleep?"

304
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,676
Veer. - You forgot to pay
my fees again, didn't you?

305
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,516
If I had paid your fees
then I wouldn't have met you.

306
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,806
- Did you have your breakfast?
- No.

307
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,774
Want some scolding? Go. Meet Fatty.

308
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,855
I can endure Fatty and her temper,
but not your anger.

309
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,697
Look.

310
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,362
Now your holidays have started.

311
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,657
I want you to tell me your plans..

312
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,653
What you want to do
during your holidays.

313
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,870
Understand?

314
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,660
Until then, I will kiss Fatty.

315
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,541
Kiss Fatty.

316
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,582
- You would rather kiss me.
- Okay.

317
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,835
Good luck, Jerry.

318
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,724
Jerry, I'm afraid things have
become a little more serious..

319
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,392
Than you expected.

320
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,937
This is Vikrant Mehra
from Social Services.

321
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,851
From today I am handling
Veer's case.

322
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,315
Veer is not some case.

323
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,977
Mr. Patel,
please don't interrupt me.

324
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:09,443
I am here on behalf of
the government.

325
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,323
After the death of your
sister and her husband..

326
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,485
Veer's legal
custody was given to you..

327
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,612
Only because you would
fulfill that duty responsibly.

328
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,160
But I am afraid due to
your fluctuating jobs..

329
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,658
And financial status..

330
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:26,536
Veer's file is getting quite fat.

331
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,627
Jerry, you haven't paid his school
fees for the past four months.

332
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,375
Four months, Mr. Patel.

333
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,958
It cannot be ignored.

334
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,211
I am not ignoring him.

335
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,218
Yes, I have been a little
late in paying his fees.

336
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,844
But I assure you that..

337
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,804
I won't repeat this mistake.

338
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,348
I just need some time.

339
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,686
And we are giving you that time.

340
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:47,727
But for the last time.

341
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,768
And that is only thanks to
Mr. Brown and Veer's advice.

342
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,440
- Thank you, sir.
- But after the holidays..

343
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,155
If you can't fulfill
Veer's basic expenses..

344
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,149
Then we will start
looking for another family..

345
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,536
- A foster home for him.
- What?

346
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,205
Foster family. Why?

347
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,829
- I am Veer's family. I..
- Mr. Patel, please.

348
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,870
Maybe you are forgetting
that Veer is a child, not me.

349
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,588
I hope that you
won't break Veer's trust.

350
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,216
See you after the holidays.

351
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,340
Two weeks.

352
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,590
Mr. Brown.

353
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:31,351
Sorry, Mr. Mathur.
We aren't hiring right now.

354
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,279
Mr. Mathur, there are no
job openings in our company.

355
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,733
Radhika, I need to
talk to you urgently.

356
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,492
- Something happened in my office and..
- Nick..

357
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,278
I'm going to India tomorrow.
So first some fresh gossip.

358
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,578
Priya-Prashant broke up.

359
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,580
What? But they were
supposed to get married next week.

360
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,666
Prashant got fired and
Priya got cold feet.

361
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,660
So will Priya marry
Prashant or his job?

362
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,708
That's exactly what I told her.

363
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,752
- I mean she can work as well.
- I can't believe it.

364
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,927
When Prashant needed her
the most, she left him.

365
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,842
There must have been parental
pressure from the beginning.

366
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,590
She might be thinking
practically as well.

367
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,550
Everyone has some
dreams for themselves.

368
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,852
After all, one can't
live on love alone.

369
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,304
Oh, so people should fall in love..

370
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,639
Only when they can afford food.

371
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,732
Come on, Nick.

372
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,643
There is nothing wrong in
wanting a nice, comfortable life.

373
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,318
You can't eat chicken roll
for the rest of your life.

374
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:22,694
"From where to bring courage when
there is not a penny in my pocket?"

375
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:27,744
"Where did those nights vanish when
I would fall asleep in an instant?"

376
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:32,496
"I would watch movies
and sing songs."

377
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,372
Jerry, cookies.

378
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,588
Here you go.

379
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,672
Oops.

380
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,383
Sorry.

381
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,588
What a pity. All the
good men are married.

382
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,715
He is Jerry Patel, single.

383
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,638
Quiet, my Facebook profile.

384
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:53,815
Call me.

385
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,692
Now you will have to buy this box.

386
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,527
Cool.

387
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,659
That will be 15 pounds.

388
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,412
Brother, I'm short of four.

389
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,294
Jerry, I don't want cookies.

390
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,588
Mom says they give you cavities.

391
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,480
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

392
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,860
- Do you like video games?
- It's awesome, Jerry.

393
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,529
Daniel, this game for Christmas.

394
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,658
And I always come first
in car racing.

395
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,373
Wow! Show me your hands.

396
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,419
- Take this.
- Wow! Cookies.

397
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,844
Bills. Bills.

398
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,880
Job rejections.

399
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,760
Job rejections. Rent.

400
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,679
Rent.

401
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,552
And a letter from your mother.

402
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,558
Jiggu, a letter from your mother.

403
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,606
I get it.

404
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,650
Jiggu, a letter from your mother.

405
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:30,455
Look, I have only two weeks
to pay Jerry's school fees.

406
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,831
Look, J. I lost the money that
I invested in the stock market..

407
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,375
And my savings were spent in
paying the rent and expenses.

408
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,381
Nick, you don't understand.

409
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,375
The Social Service people..

410
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,379
Will hand over my
Veer to a foster family.

411
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,389
I cannot lose Veer, Nick.

412
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,723
Don't even think like that, Jerry.

413
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,430
We will figure something out.

414
00:25:57,431 --> 00:26:01,686
Nick, I was thinking why don't you
take up some small jobs like me?

415
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,278
Drive a taxi.

416
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,276
Sell pirated DVDs.

417
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,817
I am an MBA from the
London School of Economics.

418
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,953
If I take up such jobs,
what's the point of my degree?

419
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,537
Degree. Degree. Degree.

420
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,406
What is the difference
between you and me today?

421
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,657
Tell me. What is the difference?

422
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,366
Today your Mercedes and my cycle..

423
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,244
Are standing at the
signal of recession.

424
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,539
Mr. Mathur, you and I.. are same.

425
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,292
We are on the same level.

426
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,594
Bragging about his degree.

427
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:33,388
J, if one door has closed on us,
another one will open up..

428
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,433
Where we will make money
and retain our honor as well.

429
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,296
J, I don't think
we should go inside.

430
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,922
Like you said, Nick..

431
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,766
If one door closes,
the other one opens up itself.

432
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,305
Come on.

433
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,633
- I have seen enough.
- Nick, stop.

434
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,767
If you didn't want to
stay then why did you come?

435
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:02,352
Don't you want to know
why I gave you my card?

436
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,544
Welcome, boys.

437
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,969
Instead of sitting at the
bar and crying like girls..

438
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,972
Take a look at
yourselves in the mirror.

439
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,053
You two have it in you.

440
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,476
But don't have the
brains to recognize it.

441
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,685
I have three branches,
London, New York and Tokyo.

442
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,566
I am having some
license troubles in Mumbai.

443
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,988
Here's the form. That's the door.

444
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,903
It's your choice.

445
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,917
Chest.

446
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,996
Biceps.

447
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,005
Size.

448
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,925
Fantastic career move.

449
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,340
Super plan.

450
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,348
- I am waiting outside.
- Nick.

451
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,133
Nick.

452
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,186
He's slightly crazy.

453
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,976
The poor guy's in love.
He is in love.

454
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,140
What is love.

455
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,519
Baby don't hurt me.

456
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,863
Don't hurt me no more.

457
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,067
You are in love too.

458
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,162
The only difference is he is
standing outside for his love..

459
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,408
And you.. will fill this form.

460
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,918
Name, Jerry Patel.

461
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,885
Chest..

462
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,380
42

463
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,344
- Biceps..
- 20.

464
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,604
Mine.

465
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,733
Yours are 16.

466
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,270
16

467
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:16,069
Size, 11.

468
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,494
Sexual preference.

469
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,659
- Female.
- Good.

470
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,535
Obviously female.

471
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,457
- Sir, let me sign.
- No need for that.

472
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,218
Like I said..

473
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,462
You just need to be recognized.

474
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,174
From today you are Rocco.

475
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:48,105
You have all the
qualifications of an escort.

476
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,398
Sir, what will I have to do?

477
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,017
You will spread happiness..

478
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,652
Is Santa Claus on a holiday?

479
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,274
To lonely, sad and bored women.

480
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,744
Make them forget the
problems of their life for a while..

481
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,904
And you will make them happy.

482
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,489
It may be shopping.

483
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:07,123
And then a bit dinner.

484
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,618
Or making her boyfriend jealous.

485
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:11,211
- Or taking girls to the cinema.
- Right.

486
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,962
You will get the time
and address on this.

487
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,505
- Okay.
- Got it.

488
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,212
Get used to the new name.

489
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,465
I am Rocco.

490
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,841
I am Rocco.

491
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,385
From Jignesh to Jerry.

492
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:27,887
And now Rocco.

493
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,475
The standard of your
name is falling lower.

494
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,562
Oh, your principles, your rules.

495
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,066
Your principles can't get us
a decent square meal, Nick.

496
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,905
How can you joke about it, Jerry?

497
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,820
How could you fill that form?

498
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,067
It's nothing.

499
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,326
I just had to write my
upper-body measurement..

500
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,366
And my shoe-size. That's all.

501
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,243
If you wrote down your shoe size..

502
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,082
Then there is going to
be a long line of girls.

503
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,341
- Hello.
- Ritz hotel. Room 136.

504
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,929
<i>7</i> o'clock.

505
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,347
Jignesh Patel, get up.

506
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,436
There's a message for your shoes.

507
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,903
She will tell you the
means of her happiness.

508
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,657
And you will decide the
limits of her happiness.

509
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:31,708
The smaller the limits,
the more the money.

510
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,227
My name is Rocco, and I am
here to spread happiness.

511
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,652
Perfect.

512
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:10,865
I have heard that male
escorts are naughty, not shy.

513
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,407
I'm getting married next week.

514
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,706
So I thought I deserved some fun.

515
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,041
So, Rocco.

516
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,549
What's the first item
on the fun menu?

517
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,085
Madam, there wouldn't be any
dearth of happiness in your life.

518
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:29,008
For fun we can go for shopping,
have dinner, and go to the cinema..

519
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:33,062
I am not paying you 400
pounds to take me to a movie.

520
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:39,060
We all have a right to
celebrate our freedom, right.

521
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,528
Paying hard to get home.

522
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,861
Your husband is calling.

523
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,958
Amit. Yes, I'm taking
the morning flight.

524
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,123
Yes, please send
the driver on time. Okay.

525
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,250
Talk to you later.

526
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,137
Whether I am single, divorcée
or the mother of six children..

527
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,847
It shouldn't make
any difference to you.

528
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,557
Sorry, but I can't do this.

529
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,472
What the hell!

530
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,187
I'm going to complain
to your agency.

531
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:37,285
Jerry, you won't leave me
like my parents, will you?

532
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,910
No, son. Never.
I'll never leave you.

533
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,413
How can I leave you?

534
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,127
I promise.

535
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,545
Take this.

536
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,168
I swear on Iron Man.

537
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,631
You swear on Iron Man?

538
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,546
Yes. I swear on Iron Man.

539
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,511
Close your eyes. Come on.

540
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:59,480
It's bad, but its business.

541
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,815
There's a bachelorette party.

542
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,601
Listen carefully.

543
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,946
A girl's wedding day is the
most important day of her life.

544
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,485
But what's more important is
the last night of her freedom.

545
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,287
And you won't let this
night come to an end.

546
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,831
This is your last chance, Rocco.

547
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,785
I know you won't listen to me.

548
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,754
Even then, I'm saying stop.

549
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,338
I know you won't listen to me..

550
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,295
But even then I'm saying,
come with me.

551
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,842
What do you think?

552
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,341
Don't I love Veer?

553
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,925
I know that we've been
sitting idle in this house..

554
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,178
For the past three months.

555
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,347
And you'll earn a lot
of money with this job.

556
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,770
But you're not that
kind of a person, Jerry.

557
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,482
What kind of a person are
you talking about, Nick?

558
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,189
The person who plays the sad songs..

559
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,362
On the subway benches because..

560
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,572
His seven-year-old child is growing
up with some other family? That one?

561
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,070
You are right. I am not that person.

562
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,369
Look, I will take up
that typist's job.

563
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,492
You can talk to the
restaurant manager.

564
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,168
You might get that job.

565
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,413
How long will we lie
to ourselves, Nick?

566
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,796
Today we don't even have the money..

567
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,666
To pay the rent of this apartment.

568
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,879
Why don't you understand?

569
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:12,255
Since college, I have
failed in everything..

570
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:14,222
That you haven't supported me in.

571
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,764
But I cannot fail today.

572
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,885
It's okay if you aren't coming along.

573
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,934
At least don't stop me from trying.

574
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,581
Attention, ladies.

575
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,744
I am inspector Rocco.

576
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,463
And according to my investigations..

577
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,582
A serious crime is
going to be committed here.

578
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:56,262
A hot, single, innocent
girl is about to get married.

579
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,723
Where is she?

580
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,519
I am Natasha Mehra.

581
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:08,485
And I am that hot,
single, innocent girl..

582
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,228
Who is about to get married.

583
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:15,610
By the way, what will my
punishment be, inspector?

584
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:28,672
Natasha, you will have to
spend the night in my jail.

585
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,667
Will you punish all the girls?

586
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,842
Alone? You will get tired,
inspector.

587
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,759
Batman is incomplete without Robin.

588
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,683
Veeru is incomplete without Jai.

589
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,847
Similarly, Hunter will
surely come on Rocco's call.

590
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,271
Even Rajnikant will
clap on such a dialogue.

591
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,645
"Make some noise for the Desi Boyz."

592
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,693
"The Boys."

593
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:57,700
"The Boys."

594
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,258
"Let's go. Come on."

595
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,508
"We will rule the
hearts of the girls."

596
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,512
"That's the rumor."

597
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:28,269
"We will break even Romeo's record."

598
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,313
"Set new rules of love."

599
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,645
"Everyone says we are naughty."

600
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,741
"But we are decent at heart."

601
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,572
"Make some noise for the Desi Boyz."

602
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,528
"One two three go."

603
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,196
"Dancing on English beats."

604
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,706
"Swaying to the heartbeats."

605
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,450
"Jamming to the rhythm."

606
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:47,833
"The Desi Boyz."

607
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,624
"Looking all handsome and decent."

608
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,587
"With their broad chest and biceps."

609
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:52,921
"Jamming to the rhythm."

610
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,666
"The Desi Boyz."

611
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,634
"Dancing on English beats."

612
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,503
"Swaying to the heartbeats."

613
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,845
"Jamming to the rhythm."

614
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,588
"The Desi Boyz."

615
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,512
"Looking all handsome and decent."

616
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:04,930
"With their broad chest and biceps."

617
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,644
"Jamming to the rhythm."

618
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,684
"The Desi Boyz."

619
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:25,493
"We only spread love."

620
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,742
"The girls are always
looking for us."

621
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:32,497
"They say Lady Gaga is our fan."

622
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,499
"Tell her to come
and meet us sometime."

623
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:42,222
"Our only rule is to
keep the girls happy."

624
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,840
"Make some noise for
the Desi Boyz."

625
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,509
"One two three go."

626
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,518
"Dancing on English beats."

627
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:48,894
"Swaying to the heartbeats."

628
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,685
"Jamming to the rhythm."

629
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,398
"The Desi Boyz."

630
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,641
"Looking all handsome and decent."

631
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,727
"With their broad chest
and biceps."

632
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,441
"Jamming to the rhythm."

633
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,235
"The Desi Boyz."

634
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:29,515
"We are quite good
at doing mischief."

635
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,890
"it is our duty,
whenever we see a girl."

636
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:36,518
"We always drop at home,
never return late at night."

637
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:39,487
"Come dance with me."

638
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:43,234
"We are the weakness of girls,
they squander all their wealth on us."

639
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,487
"The entire world quarrels over us."

640
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,535
"What did you see in us? Come,
let's ask her too."

641
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,830
"Come dance with me."

642
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,500
"Everyone says we are naughty."

643
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,792
"But we are decent at heart."

644
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,714
"Make some noise for the Desi Boyz."

645
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,418
"One two three go."

646
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,887
"Dancing on English beats."

647
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,677
"Swaying to the heartbeats."

648
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,590
"Jamming to the rhythm."

649
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,934
"The Desi Boyz."

650
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,678
"Looking all handsome and decent."

651
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,680
"With their broad chest and biceps."

652
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:15,307
"Jamming to the rhythm."

653
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,899
"The Desi Boyz."

654
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,560
"We have seen in all the nooks
and corners of the entire world."

655
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,440
"The Desi Boyz are the best."

656
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,440
"Raise your voices."

657
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,239
"Make some noises."

658
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,745
"We are here just for you."

659
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,655
"The Desi Boyz."

660
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,407
800. 900.

661
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,451
1 OOO

662
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,654
These are the fees,
and this the rent.

663
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,658
Desi Boyz is the only
company that is recession-proof.

664
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,954
Look, Jerry.

665
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:17,456
Don't get so happy.

666
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:18,703
And listen carefully.

667
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:19,954
We have to follow three rules.

668
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,707
Your rules, your principles.

669
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,301
Listen, nothing else.

670
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,921
Fine, next.

671
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,297
Rule no 2.

672
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:33,302
No one should know our real names.

673
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,594
I was thinking of changing
my name to Rocco permanently.

674
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,938
- Third rule.
- Yes, third one.

675
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,352
Radhika.

676
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,397
Radhika should never
find out about is.

677
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,894
It's better that she finds out.

678
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:43,770
She will leave you.

679
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:44,862
This matter will end here.

680
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:03,710
My husband.

681
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:12,423
Thank you, for last night.

682
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,654
Thank you, for last night.

683
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,965
Thank you, for last night.

684
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,469
But still, Jerry.

685
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,811
Everyone's fathers will be
talking about their jobs.

686
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,351
What's this idea about giving
an interview on Father's Day?

687
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:02,849
If we were been in India..

688
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,318
It would've ended with a
game of musical chair and snacks.

689
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,352
But what is the problem, Jerry?

690
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,698
You have paid my fees and
now you also have a job.

691
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,404
That's the problem, Shorty.

692
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:14,944
What happened?

693
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,533
Say something.

694
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,998
I have a bet with Daniel.

695
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,708
He keeps teasing me all the time.

696
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,920
Today he will know
that I have a dad as well.

697
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,757
Thank you, Dr. Gibson.

698
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,335
So, who is next?

699
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:32,341
Mr. Patel.

700
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,723
Would you like to tell the
class about what you do?

701
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,352
Since it's Father's Day
I would like to talk..

702
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,594
In the language me
and my son understand.

703
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,939
- If that is okay with you.
- Sure, Mr. Patel.

704
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,441
What do I tell you
about my job, Veer?

705
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:57,696
I don't hold a dignified
job like the other parents.

706
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,699
I am an ordinary man..

707
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,334
Who has done really ordinary jobs.

708
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,710
But my recognition isn't
from what I do but from you.

709
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:13,712
I will happily take up
any good or bad job..

710
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:17,431
So that you don't lack anything.

711
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,467
You won't be ordinary like me.

712
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,310
You can dream all you want.

713
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,723
And I promise you, all
your dreams will be fulfilled.

714
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:26,645
Love you, my son.

715
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,150
Love you Jerry.

716
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,610
Don't cry.

717
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,199
All the girls are watching.

718
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,989
They will tease you all your life.

719
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,741
- Here, your PSP.
- Wow!

720
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,003
Mr. Patel, I don't think
anyone needs a language..

721
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,291
To recognize love.

722
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,801
- Thank you for coming.
- Pleasure.

723
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:58,590
Rocco and Hunter have
the longest clientele..

724
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,591
In the shortest time.

725
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,640
Here's to the Desi Boyz family.

726
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:04,683
Bottoms up.

727
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,730
Delivery in 30 minutes or free.

728
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,816
That's 20 quits for the pizza, right?

729
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,581
This is for thinking I
am a pizza delivery boy.

730
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,793
And this is for
stealing my daughter from me.

731
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,587
- Aren't you surprised to see us?
- He is shocked.

732
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,211
Come on, introduce us
to your guests.

733
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,008
And keep the change.

734
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,300
I didn't know there is a party here.

735
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,135
And who are these people?

736
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,428
I have never met them before.

737
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,021
Nothing, they are
just colleagues, Rads.

738
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:47,809
I thought we will meet at home.

739
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,058
- They will get to know each other.
- Well done.

740
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:54,279
'Show her the new office
along with the new colleagues.'

741
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,740
'I will handle Radhika
and you handle her dad.'

742
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,024
Daddy. Daddy.

743
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,704
Relax, you are like so pretend.

744
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,792
I am a little ticklish.
So stop it please.

745
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:09,873
Please.

746
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,713
And leave you stressed out
like this? No way. - Okay.

747
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,922
Uncle, uncle.

748
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,708
I am Jerry, Nick's friend.

749
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,507
- Nick's best friend.
- Suresh Awasthi, nice to meet you.

750
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,763
Radhika often talks about you.

751
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,762
Wake me up, before you go. Go.

752
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,351
No, no. Not now.

753
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,345
Continue. You are priceless. Come on.

754
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,349
- Actually it's 200 pounds an hour.
- What?

755
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,892
What does Radhika say about me?

756
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:36,734
Radhika says that you
are a useless, insolent..

757
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:40,028
Ill-mannered man.

758
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,698
- By the way, I like people like you.
- Thank you, uncle.

759
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,070
Can I say something?

760
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:48,082
Your daughter Radhika
isn't like you at all.

761
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,710
Son, God blessed
Radhika with my looks..

762
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,920
But unfortunately with
the brains of her mother.

763
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,163
Cherry, hop on.

764
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,916
Let's go for the ride of our life.

765
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,338
Come on.

766
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,170
Okay, Cherry.

767
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:01,588
You don't look so heavy.

768
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,339
- Because it's not Cherry, it's Jerry.
- Jerry.

769
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,016
- Here's your drink.
- Thank you.

770
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,722
You know what?

771
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,850
Nick has the finest body at work.

772
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:11,977
Excuse me.

773
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:14,062
Finest body of work, Rads.

774
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,647
My client's list is very impressive.

775
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,361
Oh, they just love him.

776
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,401
Don't be so modest, Nick.

777
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:20,899
I see, and what do you do?

778
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,900
I forgot to introduce you.

779
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,323
- Radhika is my girlfriend.
- Fiancé.

780
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:27,371
Fiancé?

781
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:31,701
You are going to break
a lot of hearts, Nick.

782
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,836
She was flirting with
you right before me.

783
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,752
Girls are crazy about me.

784
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,215
Jealous?

785
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,181
I don't have a problem with that.

786
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,801
Suresh Awasthi.

787
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,145
- And you are..
- It's not easy.

788
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,981
- It will take time.
- I have all the time.

789
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,935
- I don't like empty glasses.
- Sir.

790
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,738
You must be Nick's boss.

791
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,900
I can recognize a
person's talent really well.

792
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,319
Beautiful head.

793
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:10,911
Baby oil.

794
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,373
My company needs people like you.

795
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,710
Thank you very much.

796
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,289
By the way, I'm a
retired gynecologist.

797
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,966
You look really fit
even after retirement.

798
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,885
Do pay me a visit
when you have the time.

799
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,183
Here's my card.

800
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,979
Sir, I will keep this card.

801
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,139
Sir, your drink.

802
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,400
- He's a good boss.
- Yes, sir.

803
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,939
- Baby oil.
- Yes, sir.

804
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,983
- I like him.
- I like him too.

805
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,526
Ask your dad to stop hitting me.

806
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,407
Sir, you aren't drinking anything.

807
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,692
Sir?

808
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:48,570
You are going to marry my daughter..

809
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,783
And you are calling me sir?

810
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,863
Celebration time, friends.

811
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,958
Hunter is going to get married.

812
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,997
What a coincidence!

813
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,671
Nick and Radhika are
getting married as well.

814
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,585
You will be happy to know that..

815
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,959
Your son-in-law has been promoted..

816
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,756
To the Platinum Club of our agency.

817
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:08,177
A person can be recognized
from the friends he keeps.

818
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,637
I am proud of you.

819
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,179
Can you feel love tonight.

820
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:19,729
Darling, on the occasion
of your wedding to Hunter..

821
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,150
The employees from our
agency will dance for free.

822
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,533
- Meaning?
- He means to say..

823
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,700
Everyone will dance freely, openly.

824
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,618
In joy. Open. Open.

825
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,332
Why is he calling you Hunter?

826
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,953
Because he hunts his
clients down, baby.

827
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,961
I am so proud of you.

828
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,591
Good choice.

829
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,892
Salmon Lounge. 10:00 PM.

830
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,056
Okay, we will be there.

831
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,470
We?

832
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:57,638
Both of us.

833
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,807
Do you know Hunter and
Rocco are so much in demand?

834
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,229
I don't care.

835
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,567
I can't handle this double life.

836
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:03,811
I can't lie to Radhika.

837
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,276
And finally I have lined
up some decent interviews.

838
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,649
I need a real job soon.

839
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,777
- 5000 pounds and..
- Tomorrow 10,000.

840
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,152
The day after tomorrow 15.

841
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:13,450
Vodka tonic for you.

842
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:14,823
J, you are forgetting..

843
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:17,200
What we are losing
to earn this money.

844
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,951
What else do we have
other than these biceps?

845
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,870
I don't know about you
but I have a lot of things.

846
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,872
Paid Veer's fees, saved the house.

847
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,544
Saved money for Radhika's wedding.

848
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,799
Now find a suitable
boy and get her married.

849
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,926
Yes, and I will dance at her
bachelorette party, right?

850
00:51:27,927 --> 00:51:29,545
Fantastic. Mind-blasting idea.

851
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:30,929
Listen carefully.

852
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,966
Hunter has retired.

853
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,635
Hey listen. Listen.

854
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:38,429
What are you doing?

855
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,898
Hunter, you took up this job for me..

856
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:44,485
- And I love you for that.
- Get up, Jerry.

857
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,818
I want to get Veer out
of the boarding school..

858
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,816
And keep him with me.

859
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,693
I know you can get a good job.

860
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:53,988
And no need to be concerned about me.

861
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:55,112
I can take up any job.

862
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,207
But, Nick, our life
will become normal.

863
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,336
This is the startup cost
of a normal, simple life.

864
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,414
I swear, on my mother.

865
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:08,292
This is the last time.

866
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,842
Always resorting to
emotional dialogues.

867
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,268
We are <i>so</i> compatible.

868
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,853
Why don't you leave
Radhika and marry me?

869
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:21,351
Keep a distance from me.

870
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:28,396
- This is crazy.
- What's so funny, guys?

871
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:30,229
Rads, you have to check this out.

872
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,857
He has the maximum hits on-line.

873
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,408
"They call us Superman."

874
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,829
"Switch on your handycam."

875
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,743
"From AM to PM."

876
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,792
"We are at your service ma'am."

877
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,586
"Don't let the night end."

878
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,504
"Don't let this meeting end."

879
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:57,625
"Don't let.. each other fall asleep."

880
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,828
I love you.

881
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,873
"I love you immensely."

882
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,704
"Come into my arms, darling."

883
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,548
"Only for this night."

884
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,877
"Our attitude is rustic."

885
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,506
"You will be floored."

886
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:40,518
"Come into my arms, darling."

887
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,720
"Only for this night."

888
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,769
"Don't let the night end."

889
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,482
"Don't let this meeting end."

890
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,853
"Don't let.. each other fall asleep."

891
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,696
"You are my hero."

892
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:57,697
"You are my hero."

893
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:00,329
"Don't let the night end."

894
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:01,743
"Don't let this meeting end."

895
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:05,164
"Don't let.. each other fall asleep."

896
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:06,786
"I am your hero."

897
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,795
"I am your hero."

898
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:10,623
"Hero."

899
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,757
"I am your hero."

900
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,332
"I find you really hot."

901
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,252
"You look one in a million."

902
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:53,295
"Now I have the chance."

903
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,840
"We won't get this chance again."

904
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,759
"Give me the opportunity."

905
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,680
"Come and have some fun."

906
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,772
"Come into my arms, darling."

907
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,857
"Only for this night."

908
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,852
"Don't let the night end."

909
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,649
"Don't let this meeting end."

910
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:18,195
"Don't let... each other fall asleep."

911
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,238
"You are my hero."

912
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,368
"You are my hero."

913
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,579
"Don't let the night end."

914
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,292
"Don't let this meeting end."

915
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,703
"Don't let.. each other fall asleep."

916
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,377
"You are my hero."

917
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:39,386
"You are my hero."

918
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,217
"I am your hero."

919
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,386
"Listen, you rich girls."

920
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:44,884
I am a pious man.'

921
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:46,926
"I am everyone's friend."

922
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,554
"I have seen the world."

923
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,397
"We are the only good guys left."

924
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,857
"Girls are crazy about us."

925
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:53,643
"They squander their wealth on us."

926
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,732
"Life has brought us to a turn."

927
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,571
"To save myself I have to run."

928
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,486
"I said to my Lord."

929
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,573
"I said to him."

930
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,699
"Don't let the night end."

931
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,861
"Don't let the night end."

932
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,579
"Don't let this meeting end."

933
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:09,200
"Don't let.. each other fall asleep."

934
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,496
"You are my hero."

935
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,881
"You are my hero."

936
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,216
"Hero."

937
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:19,714
"I am your hero."

938
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,508
"I am your hero."

939
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,263
"You are my hero."

940
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,552
"You are my hero."

941
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:31,354
"They call us Superman."

942
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,848
"Switch on your handycam."

943
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,608
"From AM to PM."

944
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,853
"We are at your service ma'am."

945
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,229
"Hero."

946
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:39,438
"You are my hero."

947
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,364
"You are my hero."

948
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,200
"You are my hero."

949
00:56:58,415 --> 00:56:59,792
"You are my hero."

950
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,312
Rads, I know this looks bad.

951
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,644
But I didn't sleep with any of them.

952
00:57:13,645 --> 00:57:14,606
Please listen to me.

953
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:15,815
I was unemployed for three months.

954
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,401
I didn't have money.

955
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,518
I was about to lose my home.

956
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:20,817
I thought I would lose
you too if I tell you.

957
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,199
You have already lost me, Nick.

958
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,822
Or should I call you Hunter?

959
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,490
Rads, I didn't want to lie to you.

960
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:28,487
But how could I tell you the truth?

961
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,365
You didn't consider me worthy
of telling me the truth, Nick.

962
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:34,417
- God, who was I with for three years?
- Rads, please..

963
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,749
I was going to spend
my life with a stranger.

964
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,624
At least you saved me
from making that mistake.

965
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,757
Radhika, please don't do that.

966
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,560
- Mr. Mehra, I can get a good job.
- How?

967
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,766
You are a college dropout.

968
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,768
You can't stay long
even on a small job.

969
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,362
You had to become a male escort.

970
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,356
After all, what options do you have?

971
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:07,402
You see I can.. I can try and..

972
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,535
Jerry please. Please don't do this.

973
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,322
Mr. Patel, you and I
want the same thing.

974
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,532
What's right for Veer.

975
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,869
Jerry, there is a nice
family who wants to adopt him.

976
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,417
Veer has already lost his family.

977
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:20,790
He won't endure this.

978
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,382
Not just him, even I
won't be able to endure this.

979
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,719
Look, Jerry, if you want you
can still rectify your mistake..

980
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,759
Just clean up your act.

981
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,681
And four months later..

982
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,761
You can fight in the court
for legal custody of Veer.

983
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:35,429
But for now..

984
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:38,353
The department will keep
Veer with a foster family.

985
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,332
Shall we go home?

986
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,595
Veer, I..

987
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,428
I'm going to India for a few days.

988
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:13,891
You're lying.

989
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:18,306
You'd promised that
you would never leave me.

990
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,429
I'm not leaving you.

991
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,399
I'm going there only for a few days.

992
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,560
And you know I have found
a very big family for you.

993
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,904
You will stay with them.

994
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,443
This is just a small video game.

995
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,282
They have a bigger video game.

996
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,742
Bigger swimming pool.

997
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,907
You can bring your friends
there and play with them.

998
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,945
You will have lots of fun.

999
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,530
No, I don't want anything.

1000
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,374
I don't want the PSP.

1001
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,460
I won't ask for a cookies either.

1002
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,328
I will be a good boy.

1003
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:43,672
But you already are a good boy.

1004
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,539
Who said you are not a good boy?

1005
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,416
You are a very good boy.

1006
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:49,010
Then why does everyone leave me?

1007
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,426
And you are leaving me
just like mom and dad.

1008
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,300
- No, son. It's not like that.
- No. Don't go, Jerry.

1009
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,976
We need to go now, Mr. Patel.

1010
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,392
No, I'm not coming with you.

1011
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,605
<i>Okay.</i>

1012
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,817
When I come back,
we'll live together.

1013
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,310
Understand.

1014
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,359
And this.

1015
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,657
Keep this phone with you.

1016
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,284
And this PSP.

1017
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,909
I'll call you every day from India.

1018
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,246
No, you are lying.

1019
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,828
I swear on Iron Man, okay.

1020
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,962
I'm sorry, sir.
But we need to go now.

1021
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:25,668
- Look after yourself.
- Jerry.

1022
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,507
- I'll call you every day.
- Jerry.

1023
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,005
- I'll call you every day.
- Jerry, please.

1024
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:30,844
Please, stop him.

1025
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,553
But wish I could.

1026
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,234
Nick, what is this?

1027
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,525
What I should have done long ago.

1028
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,324
Then I might not have lost Radhika.

1029
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:00,366
- Will she come back if I leave?
- I don't know.

1030
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:04,286
But if you stay here then
I will lose her forever.

1031
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:06,004
Nick, do you know
what you are saying?

1032
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,797
Darn it, I was an investment banker.

1033
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:09,500
I had a promising future.

1034
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,376
I was not a shortcut
expert like you.

1035
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,004
The truth is today
I lost everything..

1036
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,805
In my efforts to make you win.

1037
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,850
You turned me into you.

1038
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:23,389
Nick, you and I knew what
we were doing was wrong.

1039
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,478
- But for Veer..
- Where is Veer?

1040
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,268
Did you get Veer?

1041
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,859
You didn't bring him along?

1042
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,195
Veer. Veer.

1043
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,818
Where is he?

1044
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,649
Face it, Jerry.

1045
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,618
If you were really
concerned about Jerry..

1046
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,658
Then you would have
understood long ago.

1047
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,329
That a person who isn't capable..

1048
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,290
Of shouldering his
own responsibility..

1049
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,250
Can never handle the
responsibility of a child.

1050
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,459
Stop it, Nick.

1051
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:48,376
Thank God, Jerry.
They took Veer away from you.

1052
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,832
Maybe now he will have
a better life..

1053
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,006
Which you could
never have given him.

1054
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,387
You have proved that
Veer isn't your son.

1055
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,343
Stop it.

1056
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,602
Get out.

1057
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:40,882
My abs.

1058
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,309
Radhika.

1059
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,262
Radhika, I can't run
early in the morning.

1060
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,185
Rads, listen to me.

1061
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:48,606
Rads, just stop.

1062
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,725
Rads. Rads.

1063
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:54,863
Radhika, I love you.

1064
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,409
Tired.

1065
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:07,584
In our times girls
used to be so stubborn.

1066
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,544
But we knew how to appease them.

1067
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,169
What do think? Romeo
used to beg like you do?

1068
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,008
There weren't male escorts either.

1069
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,169
And there's no use.
Radhika doesn't love..

1070
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:18,887
She still loves you.

1071
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:20,551
I understand her really well.

1072
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:23,173
I raised her and pampered her.

1073
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,222
- So there's hope?
- Of course there is hope.

1074
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,812
Good luck for winning
my daughter's heart.

1075
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:31,350
- Thank you, sir.
- And this is for breaking her heart.

1076
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,192
Sorry.

1077
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,445
It's a father's
right to slap you once.

1078
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,196
Otherwise her mother will feel bad.

1079
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:39,653
Miss you, Gayatri.

1080
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,947
- Sorry, aunt.
- Say "Sorry uncle".

1081
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,536
- Sorry, uncle.
- Yes.

1082
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,576
You won't get your love back..

1083
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:47,324
By spending one
night outside the house.

1084
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:50,539
Only the one who is ready to wait
all his life outside the house..

1085
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,458
Gets his love.

1086
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,296
Are you thinking what I am thinking?

1087
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,424
If you are thinking
what I am thinking..

1088
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:01,713
Then you are really intelligent.

1089
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,507
- I really like you.
- Uncle.

1090
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,890
No, no, not in that manner.

1091
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,472
My daughter likes you.

1092
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,308
Don't get ambitious.

1093
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,149
"Let it be, let it be,
let it go now."

1094
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,073
"I cried enough,
now let me smile."

1095
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:29,200
"I know that I deserve
another chance."

1096
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:32,328
"Let me rectify my mistake."

1097
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,251
"Let me bring a twist to the story."

1098
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:40,465
"I know that
I deserve another chance."

1099
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,801
"For the sake of my helplessness."

1100
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,016
"For my sake."

1101
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,806
"Just forsake your anger."

1102
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,305
"How long will you
stay aloof from your kin."

1103
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:54,182
Twelve years ago
I made a big mistake.

1104
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,067
I left college.

1105
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,604
So I thought of
rectifying my first mistake.

1106
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,441
And maybe everything
else will get better itself.

1107
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,830
Jignesh, Jerry, Rocco.

1108
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,625
Three names, no job.

1109
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,298
Qualification, too low.

1110
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:22,506
Age, too old.

1111
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:24,675
Hello.

1112
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,302
Hi, I am Rohan.

1113
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:27,845
Your son Jerry's roommate.

1114
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,638
Hey, bro.

1115
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,511
You didn't tell me your dad's here.

1116
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,889
Oh no, this is
Jerry's dad and not mine.

1117
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,232
- Jerry's dad.
- My new roommate.

1118
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:38,644
By the way, uncle, where is Jerry?

1119
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:41,396
Children, I am Jerry.

1120
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,574
- No. No. No ways.
- Such a big Jerry.

1121
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,075
Give your uncle a big hug.

1122
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:49,784
Now come on, let's
take a bath together.

1123
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,573
- No, no.
- Come on, let's go.

1124
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,041
Let me put some shampoo on you.

1125
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:13,641
"A beautiful girl lives
right in front of me."

1126
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,647
- Dad.
- Why are you screaming, dear?

1127
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,892
I am right here. I came
to have beer with him.

1128
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,526
Dad, call the police.

1129
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:23,146
He is illegally
trespassing on our property.

1130
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,490
- This is our parking space, dad.
- Oh, God.

1131
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:26,904
- Will you tell her or should I?
- I will tell her.

1132
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:30,154
Dear, this morning I sold
the parking space to him.

1133
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:32,372
Rads, dad needed the money.

1134
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,287
That's why I bought Fubu too.

1135
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,576
- Fubu.
- Baby.

1136
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,044
He is not like you.

1137
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,837
Once he gives a commitment..

1138
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,331
He never breaks it.

1139
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,333
Dear, he has turned his
bathroom into his drawing room..

1140
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:45,005
And his drawing
room into his bedroom.

1141
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,548
Disgusting fellow.

1142
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,216
And you are helping him?

1143
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,798
Unbelievable, dad.

1144
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:54,394
Rads. - Son, people often make
such mistakes during recession.

1145
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,847
The only difference is that
I sold him the parking lot..

1146
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,518
And he took off his clothes.

1147
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,229
Silly boy...

1148
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:04,067
Nick. I think I will have to
sleep here with you tonight.

1149
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,736
- Uncle.
- Don't get ambitious.

1150
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,108
Come on, get in.

1151
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,907
"Until I don't want."

1152
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,780
"I will spend the
night at your doorstep."

1153
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:17,955
"I know that I
deserve another chance."

1154
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,544
- Hello.
- Jerry.

1155
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:21,003
Jerry is dead, mother.

1156
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:23,130
Jignesh. Your son, Jignesh.

1157
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:25,216
You woke up early today.
Going to work.

1158
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:26,968
I lied to you, mother.

1159
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:28,720
- I left my job.
- What?

1160
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,713
And the car? I never had a car.

1161
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,761
I don't understand anything.
Where are you, son?

1162
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,055
- I am at the college, mother.
- College.

1163
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,803
I am at the college, mother.

1164
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:39,898
You have become a teacher.

1165
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:42,692
Jiggu, what are you teaching?

1166
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:44,686
I am not teaching, I am learning.

1167
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,404
What are you learning at this age?

1168
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:48,068
I am learning to speak the truth.

1169
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,315
Jiggu.

1170
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:53,703
- Are you fine?
- I love you, mother.

1171
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,086
Sorry. I am Jerry.

1172
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,134
Hi, guys. I am Tanya Sharma.

1173
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,599
Your economics
professor for this semester.

1174
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:17,310
Hotness.

1175
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,350
Wake up, gulls...

1176
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,018
I know you had a long holiday.

1177
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,268
But a warmer welcome would be nice.

1178
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,405
If anyone had done
this in your times..

1179
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:31,191
He would have been
thrown out of the class.

1180
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,904
Please get out of my class.

1181
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:36,033
Even in your times he has
to stay out of the class.

1182
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,789
Not you. You.

1183
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,539
Out of my class.

1184
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:46,835
But I haven't done anything.

1185
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,879
I know what you have done.

1186
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,377
Out of the class.

1187
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:59,511
So class we begin with
chapter one of Micro economics.

1188
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,804
Now I am back to
complete my last semester.

1189
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,477
Excuse me.

1190
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:05,517
- Oh sorry.
- Sorry.

1191
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,230
Excuse me, professor.

1192
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,863
Can I know why you
threw me out of the class?

1193
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,403
Because you didn't call back.

1194
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:16,410
- When did you ask me to call back?
- Twelve years ago.

1195
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:18,659
What do you mean by 12 years?

1196
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:22,993
When you used to make
put in a proxy for you..

1197
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,624
Copy my notes and
during the exams..

1198
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,294
Sit behind me and copy my
paper in the senior years.

1199
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,214
Tanya Sharma.

1200
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,088
Even after that I failed.
Here, here Taniya.

1201
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:37,348
Because you couldn't
even copy properly.

1202
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,008
And you didn't even recognize me.

1203
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,306
How could I recognize you?

1204
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:42,969
You used to wear braces then.

1205
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,517
You've lost 50 kilos.

1206
01:09:44,639 --> 01:09:50,237
The Tanya I knew used to be
the model for XXL clothes.

1207
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,730
Now you are so unfit.

1208
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,190
Stop.

1209
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,409
- You haven't changed at all.
- Thank you.

1210
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:57,740
I am a bit confused.

1211
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,739
Either you have opened up a
super-successful website..

1212
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,706
And become a multi-millionaire.

1213
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,247
And then returned to
college after getting bored.

1214
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:08,372
Or.. - No, no, I didn't
become a multi-millionaire.

1215
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,831
Yes. Do you know what's common..

1216
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:13,836
Between Dhirubhai Ambani,
Bill Gates and Jerry Patel?

1217
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,429
All three of them
are college dropouts.

1218
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,423
The only difference is
they have become special..

1219
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,801
And I am specially challenged.

1220
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,969
Basically life has
taken them to new heights..

1221
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,144
And sent me back
here for graduation.

1222
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:29,643
So the first step to
complete your graduation..

1223
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,862
Your class has
started five minutes ago.

1224
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,199
- What?
- Time.

1225
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:37,734
Thanks for getting me late.

1226
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,569
Run, Jerry, run.

1227
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,322
Yeah, fatso.

1228
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,660
Whatever.

1229
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,602
"Now you don't.."

1230
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:05,719
"..have to.."

1231
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,767
"..keep my heart.."

1232
01:11:06,768 --> 01:11:08,390
"..deprived of its happiness."

1233
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,766
"It was my mistake."

1234
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,360
"That I ever followed you around.."

1235
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:13,899
"..unnecessarily."

1236
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:24,705
"Now you don't.."

1237
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:25,744
"..have to.."

1238
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:27,242
"..keep my heart.."

1239
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:28,618
"..deprived of its happiness."

1240
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,837
"It was my mistake."

1241
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:32,581
"That I ever followed you around.."

1242
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:33,752
"..unnecessarily."

1243
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:36,547
"I don't trust you."

1244
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,795
"Your love seems fake to me."

1245
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,298
"I will never make
you my sweetheart."

1246
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,595
"All the dreams were unreal."

1247
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:44,717
"The heart knows."

1248
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,264
"Lord knows."

1249
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:48,729
"I made a big mistake
losing my heart to you."

1250
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,395
"It was my mistake."

1251
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:52,642
"That I ever followed you around.."

1252
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,644
"..unnecessarily."

1253
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:00,400
That reminded me of Manali.

1254
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:05,201
Radhika's mother and
I spent our honeymoon there.

1255
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:06,827
Mind blowing.

1256
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:11,415
No, no. Not him, not him. Oh no.

1257
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,292
The thing is good.

1258
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:15,872
But we should not do it regularly.

1259
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:18,843
Nicky boy keep of the grass.

1260
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,684
"Whenever I look for you.."

1261
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:33,479
"..I find myself."

1262
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,899
"I am wherever you are."

1263
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:43,284
"I swear on everyone and promise you."

1264
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:47,406
"I will never do such a thing again."

1265
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:50,663
"I don't love you any more."

1266
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:53,332
"I don't need you any more."

1267
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,625
"I am so beautiful."

1268
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,211
"Many will lose their hearts."

1269
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,672
"I am one in a million."

1270
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:03,262
"No one can surpass me."

1271
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,632
"It was my mistake."

1272
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:06,848
"That I ever followed you around.."

1273
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,718
"..unnecessarily."

1274
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:10,891
"..unnecessarily."

1275
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:16,359
Dad. - Dear, he offered me 20 pounds
for the breakfast. Tip included.

1276
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,897
If you two weren't facing a problem..

1277
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:19,862
I would have had
offered him the room above.

1278
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,401
As a tenant.

1279
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,649
One mistake should always be
forgiven in every relation.

1280
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,867
Can I have my 20 pounds back?

1281
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:40,758
"I can feel the sorrows
in your eyes."

1282
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:44,345
"I want to spend
the entire lifetime."

1283
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,852
"In each other's arms."

1284
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:54,563
"No need for the world to know."

1285
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,433
"And no need to say anything."

1286
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,187
"Let our destiny's meet."

1287
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,527
"The nights last as long as years."

1288
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,657
"Try to imagine
such moments of love."

1289
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,490
"Such a tomorrow, such moments."

1290
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,872
"it will come in
our love filled life."

1291
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:13,582
"It was my mistake."

1292
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:14,700
"That I ever followed you around.."

1293
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,452
"..unnecessarily."

1294
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,579
"I don't trust you."

1295
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,423
"Your love seems fake to me."

1296
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,667
"I will never make you
my sweetheart."

1297
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,796
"All the dreams were unreal."

1298
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,297
"The heart knows."

1299
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:28,463
"Lord knows."

1300
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:31,183
"I made a big mistake
losing my heart to you."

1301
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,551
"It was my mistake."

1302
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:34,804
"That I ever followed you around.."

1303
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,894
"..unnecessarily."

1304
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,247
You said that the one who is
ready to wait all his life..

1305
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:03,591
His love comes back.

1306
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:09,507
- You really meant it, right?
- Got it, got it.

1307
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,807
I know none of you
nincompoops can do this.

1308
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:19,600
But let's try and see who
can get this answer first.

1309
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,317
Hello.

1310
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,726
I'm fine.

1311
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:24,646
I'll call you later, bye.

1312
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:28,365
Rohan Mehta,
can you please stand up?

1313
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:31,907
Sorry, sir.
That was my mom from India.

1314
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:36,283
India. I received
an e-mail yesterday..

1315
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,751
That taught about your country.

1316
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,496
Do you know what
the population of India is?

1317
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:45,750
A lot, sir. A lot.

1318
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:49,254
1.2 billion and counting.

1319
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,849
And of this billion people,
millions are illiterate.

1320
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:57,343
In fact India has the highest
rate of illiteracy in the world.

1321
01:15:57,344 --> 01:16:00,644
Rohan, you should be thankful
that we allow fools like you..

1322
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:03,439
To come to our
country and get an education.

1323
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,279
Yes.

1324
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,739
If you don't mind me
asking you, Professor.

1325
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,359
- What e-mail account do you use?
- Hotmail.

1326
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:14,704
Ah, Sameer Bhatia, one of
those million illiterate Indians.

1327
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,496
Created that mail.

1328
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,538
Can we get back to the
problem on the board?

1329
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:23,371
Sir, can we solve that
problem without the number zero?

1330
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:27,254
No we can't and stop
asking these foolish questions.

1331
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,419
Aryabhatt, sir.

1332
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,715
Another illiterate Indian
who invented the number zero.

1333
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,171
If you guys are
such bloody geniuses..

1334
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:35,425
Why don't you study
in your own country?

1335
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:38,428
Sir, it's not easy for
nincompoops like us.

1336
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:41,429
Only brilliant minds
get accepted in India.

1337
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,603
Who knows? If you apply,
you might get rejected.

1338
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:44,850
How dare you?

1339
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,398
Get out. Both of you. Get out.

1340
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,404
Jerry, why are you
locking horns with them?

1341
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,490
That professor will give
us a zero in our exams.

1342
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:53,655
"Here you go,
a gift from Aryabhatt."

1343
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,368
Jerry.

1344
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,530
How is your general
knowledge so good? Tell me.

1345
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,953
Google. The foreigners have made it.

1346
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,826
Forget all this. There is
a party at the frat house.

1347
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,294
Are you coming?

1348
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,834
Hot chicks.

1349
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,423
I have something urgent.
See you later.

1350
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:09,383
Jerry.

1351
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:14,381
That's three chicken
burgers and two large fries.

1352
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,433
Can I have kid's combo, please?

1353
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:19,768
That will be four pounds.

1354
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,428
One kid's combo.

1355
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:24,557
50, 51, 52...

1356
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,522
I still have about..

1357
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:27,768
Give me whatever you have.

1358
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,653
Okay. That's cool. Here.

1359
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:38,488
Clap for our employee of the month.

1360
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:43,876
Since Jerry has arrived he
has increased our sales by 40%.

1361
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:47,372
Because he has
lowered our prices by 50%.

1362
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,420
Sir, that boy was hungry and
you can deduct it from my salary.

1363
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,509
Take off your uniform and get going.

1364
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,252
Excuse me.

1365
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,301
One Burger and fries.
Take-away please.

1366
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,678
No need for that. A treat
from the employee of the month.

1367
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,351
- Thank you.
- Hey, what are you doing?

1368
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:17,443
Veer, there is
someone here to see you.

1369
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:18,820
Me?

1370
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,668
I thought you'd forgotten me.

1371
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:27,953
That's impossible.

1372
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:29,546
Are you happy?

1373
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:31,414
Mom and dad left me.

1374
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,962
Jerry went to India.

1375
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,592
And I am rotting in a foster home.

1376
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:36,419
I'm very happy...

1377
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,512
Stop it, tragedy king.

1378
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,724
- How are your studies?
- Everything is fine.

1379
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,515
When Jerry returns from
India I'll come back home.

1380
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:45,309
Just look after yourself, Veer.

1381
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,726
Don't worry about Jerry.

1382
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,224
I know as long <i>as</i> you are there..

1383
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:49,942
Nothing can happen to Jerry.

1384
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,232
You don't need me or Jerry.

1385
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,230
Do you know why?
Because you have got..

1386
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,240
Iron Man.

1387
01:19:21,257 --> 01:19:22,349
Hello.

1388
01:19:22,466 --> 01:19:24,969
- Jerry.
- Hey, shorty.

1389
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:28,356
I defeated Daniel in the
100 meters race today.

1390
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:31,601
Do you go to school or not?
Or are you only after Daniel?

1391
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:33,477
When will you return, Jerry?

1392
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:36,147
- Veer, dinner is ready.
- Coming.

1393
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:38,862
Are you happy?

1394
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,909
I am filled with happiness.

1395
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,571
Can't you and Nick
ask any other question?

1396
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:46,741
Nick? Where did you find Nick?

1397
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:48,618
He came to see me.

1398
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,369
He looked sad.

1399
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:51,620
Veer.

1400
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,839
Veer, go eat your food.

1401
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:55,173
I'll talk to you later.

1402
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,840
I miss you, Jerry. Come back soon.

1403
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,179
- Love you, Veer.
- Love you too.

1404
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:05,351
If you miss him so much,
why don't you go meet him?

1405
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:12,351
No, Rohan. Now I'll go meet Veer
only when I can take him home.

1406
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,399
You know, I don't blame
you for being nervous.

1407
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:21,150
Even I've never been on
a blind date.

1408
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:22,572
No, that's not it.

1409
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,616
Blind dates are my USP.

1410
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:27,915
But the last time I was on a date..

1411
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:31,753
Her over-possessive,
violent ex-boyfriend came there.

1412
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:33,495
And he..

1413
01:20:34,621 --> 01:20:35,793
Hey, that's a game.

1414
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,336
Come on.

1415
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:38,542
Look.

1416
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,966
Which stuffed toy do you want?

1417
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:43,847
Kung Fu Panda.

1418
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:46,801
This is for you.

1419
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,772
You don't have to hit the
stuffed toy but the cans.

1420
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:55,441
Gun, please.

1421
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:59,067
- Let's go.
- Wait, he's challenging me.

1422
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,323
I will win that Panda.

1423
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,745
Wow! I'm Ajay Bapat

1424
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:11,918
I love Radhika so much that
I can kill anyone for her.

1425
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,628
Now you have to decide
whether you can die for her.

1426
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:15,834
Who is he?

1427
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:17,464
Ajay, ex-boyfriend.

1428
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,749
Ex-boyfriend, Ajay.

1429
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:20,008
My date.

1430
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:21,464
It's not that.

1431
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:25,639
Radhika, I think we should go.

1432
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:28,635
- Which stuffed toy?
- Winnie, the Pooh.

1433
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:34,894
Well done, baby.

1434
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:38,603
Well.. I was imagining your face.

1435
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,566
Let's go.

1436
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:43,565
Let's go.

1437
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:45,817
I feel like vomiting.

1438
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:49,412
See you on Monday.

1439
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,949
And before you leave please
pick up your mid-term results.

1440
01:21:58,705 --> 01:21:59,922
Fail.

1441
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:09,341
A consumable item that's
useful to people but scarce..

1442
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:14,514
A consumable item that's useful
to people but scarce in relation..

1443
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:15,935
In relation to.. No.

1444
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:19,230
A consumable item that's useful
to people but scarce in relation..

1445
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:20,523
In relation to..

1446
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:22,029
A consumable item that is..

1447
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,566
Are you taking revenge
from the books after failing?

1448
01:22:24,731 --> 01:22:26,654
Only the Economics book.

1449
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:29,035
I don't understand half the things..

1450
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:30,746
And can't remember the other half.

1451
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,957
I might stand last but can't fail.

1452
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,371
A consumable item that's useful..

1453
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,618
Do you consider me your friend?

1454
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,960
Yes, you are a very dear friend.

1455
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,252
F for friend.

1456
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,381
Trust me, I am helping you. Okay?

1457
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,796
Now come with me. Come on, Jerry.

1458
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,423
Who will Study this?

1459
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:52,142
You will when you have to. Come on.

1460
01:22:52,259 --> 01:22:54,603
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on.

1461
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,950
Tanya, don't you think
it will be a problem..

1462
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,622
If someone sees us here?

1463
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,954
I'm neither a teacher
nor do I answer questions..

1464
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,626
Outside the classroom.

1465
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:38,472
You hate me, don't you?

1466
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:43,478
Why? - You're dancing in
happiness because I failed.

1467
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,943
I heard that Rocco
dances really well.

1468
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:50,533
He died three months ago.

1469
01:23:51,109 --> 01:23:52,326
Now it's only Jerry.

1470
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:53,787
Oh, so sad.

1471
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,416
I wanted to meet him.

1472
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,628
Your case is really very serious.

1473
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:04,373
I know.

1474
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:08,090
That's why I had a
crush on you in college.

1475
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:09,879
So now I understand.

1476
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,672
You wanted me to notice you but..

1477
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,640
I was busy after the cheerleaders.

1478
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,976
And now you are taking
your 12-year-old revenge..

1479
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,470
By making sure I fail.

1480
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:19,938
I was helpless then.

1481
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:23,733
Now I am good and powerful.

1482
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,524
Why do I feel that
if I stay here any longer..

1483
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:29,068
Then I might be in danger?

1484
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,328
Everyone needs love
but not everyone gets it.

1485
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:41,668
But those who get it
don't understand it.

1486
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,083
Do you remember anything?

1487
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:46,915
Yes.

1488
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,508
Love is like an economical good..

1489
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,172
Which is consumable item
that is useful to people..

1490
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,841
But scarce in relation to demand..

1491
01:24:51,842 --> 01:24:54,556
So human efforts are
required to obtain it.

1492
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,220
Goods are divided into
tangible and intangible..

1493
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:57,638
For example.

1494
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:00,729
Your bracelet is
tangible because I can touch it.

1495
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:05,147
But love is intangible,
you can only feel it.

1496
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:07,395
Yes, I got it. I got it.

1497
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,740
I mean no one has
ever called me back.

1498
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:15,782
And you are out of my league.

1499
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:19,789
I thought that you won't
even remember my name.

1500
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,283
Don't be silly, Vijay.

1501
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,410
It's Ajay.

1502
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:27,256
- Will he come here?
- Who?

1503
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:30,380
Your ex-boyfriend?

1504
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:34,630
Nick. You don't worry
about that idiot, darling.

1505
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:36,598
He's yesterday's news.

1506
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,805
You are my future, darling.

1507
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:44,523
- And you smile wonderful.
- That sound nice.

1508
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,233
So tomorrow may be..

1509
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:48,685
I cannot stop myself.

1510
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:51,654
- I want to fly like a free bird.
- Fly.

1511
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:53,820
- I want to touch the sky.
- Touch it.

1512
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:55,738
Where no one can stop us.

1513
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:57,652
- No one.
- So take me.

1514
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,405
Take me higher, Ajay.

1515
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:01,664
- Higher.
- Higher.

1516
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:02,829
- Higher.
- Higher.

1517
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,326
Higher.

1518
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:05,873
Ba pat!

1519
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:08,793
Hi, Nick.

1520
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:11,675
- Shall we go inside?
- Inside?

1521
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,965
The date has just started, isn't it?

1522
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:16,634
Let's go.

1523
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:22,393
Ba pat!

1524
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,266
No, Radhika.

1525
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,934
We shouldn't take a
wrong step before marriage.

1526
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,152
Just sit there quietly.

1527
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:32,897
What the..

1528
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:35,732
One, two, three..

1529
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:42,531
"I cannot stop myself."

1530
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:45,751
"I want to fly like a free bird."

1531
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:47,827
Take me higher, Ajay.

1532
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,751
Higher. Higher, Ajay.

1533
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:51,756
Higher.

1534
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,759
Rads, I have known
you for three years.

1535
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,423
I know when you are faking it.

1536
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:57,671
You know what? You're right.

1537
01:26:57,796 --> 01:27:01,801
Because just like you, I don't
have any experience in these things.

1538
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,594
Shall I help you, Rads?

1539
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:04,766
Don't call me Rads.

1540
01:27:04,767 --> 01:27:06,684
Hey, only I call her Rads.

1541
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:08,773
I have had enough from you, fool.

1542
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:13,441
And if I slap you now
you will start bleeding.

1543
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:17,783
You might have a good body
but I have courage. Courage.

1544
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,118
- Vijay, I think you should leave.
- Ajay.

1545
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:21,529
Whatever, get out.

1546
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:22,787
But I..

1547
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,953
- Will you have a beer?
- No..

1548
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,206
Strictly veg.

1549
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:33,456
Then I will treat
you to omelet, come on.

1550
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:35,710
No. But my scooter
is standing outside.

1551
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:36,756
Scooter won't do any good.

1552
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,254
Radhika is very high maintenance.

1553
01:27:38,545 --> 01:27:40,718
Income tax was first
collected in 1977, no..

1554
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:43,767
- 1877..
- 1797.

1555
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:44,760
Thank you.

1556
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:46,683
Should I help?

1557
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,766
You took me to Salsa
Club after mid-terms.

1558
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:52,939
And you can take me to
Disney World after the finals.

1559
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,857
I need to focus, sunshine.

1560
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:56,772
Think about it.

1561
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:59,366
I have a fool proof method to study.

1562
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,617
You won't forget even if you try to.

1563
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:07,287
I will take off a piece of
clothing for every correct answer.

1564
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,584
The more correct answers you give..

1565
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,879
- The more clothes I take off..
- Are you stupid, Tanya?

1566
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,462
I will be ruined.

1567
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,208
Relax, it's not that easy.

1568
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,793
I ask really difficult questions.

1569
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,592
I have been studying
for the past four months.

1570
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:23,758
You will have to take off
at least three-four things.

1571
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,889
And anyway we can ask this
question after the graduation.

1572
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:28,262
First question.

1573
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:29,892
Tell me the history of income-tax.

1574
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:31,435
I don't know.

1575
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:33,316
Tell me the history of income-tax.

1576
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,482
First collected in 1797
by the Dutch Republic..

1577
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:39,777
Introduced in UK in 1799,
abolished in 1860..

1578
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:43,277
- And reintroduced in 1852.
- Very good.

1579
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:55,204
I hope you have worn many layers..

1580
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:57,549
Because right now I am in form.

1581
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,673
Define cross-elasticity.

1582
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:03,756
Cross-elasticity is when
the price of one good..

1583
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:05,799
Affects the demand of another good.

1584
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,801
For example, if the
price of coffee increases..

1585
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:09,599
People start drinking tea.

1586
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:10,808
If the price of petrol goes up..

1587
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,897
The demand for cars goes down.

1588
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:15,599
And Jerry gives his answers..

1589
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,318
And Tanya has to
take off her shirt.

1590
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:18,561
I want your shirt.

1591
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:19,734
I want your shirt.

1592
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,203
Next question.

1593
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,204
You have multiple choices.
So listen carefully. - Okay.

1594
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:38,747
I am playing this
game with you because..

1595
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:41,592
Option A, I am feeling really hot.

1596
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:46,306
Option B, this is
the best way to revise.

1597
01:29:46,423 --> 01:29:50,519
Or Option C, you haven't
kissed your girlfriend yet.

1598
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,597
The AC's on so you can't feel hot.

1599
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:56,809
You aren't my girlfriend.

1600
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:02,526
Option B. Option B.

1601
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,695
This is the best way to revise.

1602
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:09,538
Thank God, I haven't
worn anything under this.

1603
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,456
Option A.

1604
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,492
Option C. Option C.

1605
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:14,743
C.

1606
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,595
All the best for your exams.

1607
01:30:27,714 --> 01:30:29,716
It's definitely Option C.

1608
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:45,778
"Oh Lord."

1609
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:48,322
"After falling in love with you."

1610
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:51,492
"I have been ruined in
expressing it to you."

1611
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:54,207
"I fell in love with you."

1612
01:30:54,324 --> 01:30:56,497
"May God forgive you!"

1613
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:59,329
"O, Lord. That was terrible."

1614
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:01,502
"May God forgive you!"

1615
01:31:08,505 --> 01:31:11,304
"I fell in love with you."

1616
01:31:11,424 --> 01:31:13,552
"May God forgive you!"

1617
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:16,595
"Oh Lord, that was terrible."

1618
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:18,849
"May God forgive you!"

1619
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:22,524
"The sight of you
made me breathless."

1620
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:25,739
"My eyes bowed before you."

1621
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:28,315
"I worshiped you."

1622
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:30,739
"May God forgive you!"

1623
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:33,862
"I fell in love with you."

1624
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:36,457
"May God forgive you!"

1625
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:38,576
"Oh Lord, that was terrible."

1626
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:41,626
"May God forgive you!"

1627
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,465
Hey, isn't that Nick.

1628
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:50,221
You two would always
stay together in college.

1629
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:52,508
- Still in touch.
- No.

1630
01:31:55,301 --> 01:31:56,393
"Oh Lord."

1631
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:58,601
"After falling in love with you."

1632
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:01,601
"I have been ruined in
expressing it to you."

1633
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:03,523
"These days of fervor."

1634
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:04,860
"These days of love."

1635
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:07,572
"I spend them this way."

1636
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:10,400
"Thinking about you."

1637
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,822
"Questioning myself."

1638
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:14,617
"I get confused."

1639
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,833
"I finally fell in love."

1640
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:22,420
"The feelings in
our heart came out."

1641
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:24,752
"There was slight mischief."

1642
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:27,541
"May God forgive me!"

1643
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:30,261
"I lost my senses."

1644
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,676
"May God forgive me!"

1645
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:35,300
"I fell in love with you."

1646
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:36,597
"May God!"

1647
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:52,818
"I know the world taunts me."

1648
01:32:52,942 --> 01:32:55,570
"I am a vagabond."

1649
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,369
"Whatever I am.."

1650
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:00,367
"..whether I am this or that.."

1651
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:03,371
"..now I belong only to you."

1652
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:07,375
"I see you everywhere."

1653
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,343
"Wonder what's wrong with me."

1654
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,758
"I rebelled against everyone."

1655
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:15,547
"May God forgive me!"

1656
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:17,846
"I lost all my decency."

1657
01:33:17,967 --> 01:33:20,766
"May God forgive me!"

1658
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:22,855
"I fell in love with you."

1659
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:24,599
"May God!"

1660
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:28,357
"I fell in love with you."

1661
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,648
"May God forgive you!"

1662
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,482
"Oh Lord, that was terrible."

1663
01:33:33,483 --> 01:33:36,485
"May God forgive you!"

1664
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:37,453
"Oh lord."

1665
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,618
"After falling in love with you."

1666
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:41,616
"I have been ruined in
expressing it to you."

1667
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:44,626
"Oh Lord."

1668
01:33:44,744 --> 01:33:46,328
"After falling in love with you."

1669
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:48,377
"I have been ruined in
expressing it to you."

1670
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,677
Jerry

1671
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,339
Jerry, get up. Get up.

1672
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,509
The finals are in five minutes.

1673
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,678
- Get up.
- Yes.

1674
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:13,739
Culture, sir.

1675
01:34:13,857 --> 01:34:15,359
We Indians are always late.

1676
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:33,836
"The ambience is really.."

1677
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:37,305
"Deceiving today."

1678
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:42,390
"The ambience is
really deceiving today."

1679
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:45,351
"There's a.."

1680
01:34:45,471 --> 01:34:47,690
"..storm on the way."

1681
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:49,684
Rads. Rads.

1682
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:51,687
I've been trying to
apologize to you..

1683
01:34:51,811 --> 01:34:53,313
For the past three months.

1684
01:34:53,438 --> 01:34:55,440
Tell me how can
I make this better, Rads.

1685
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:57,529
Fine.

1686
01:34:58,443 --> 01:34:59,786
Then come to a hotel room tomorrow..

1687
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:03,248
Where 50 men are
throwing money on one girl.

1688
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:04,490
And that girl will be me.

1689
01:35:05,325 --> 01:35:07,953
And the day you can get
that image out of your mind..

1690
01:35:08,328 --> 01:35:09,750
I will forgive you.

1691
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:14,960
Rads, did you ever ask me
why I had to take this step?

1692
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,253
How would that justify it, Nick?

1693
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:20,388
Have you ever thought about it
that for the past three years..

1694
01:35:20,389 --> 01:35:21,974
Our life was revolving
around your perfect wedding..

1695
01:35:22,342 --> 01:35:26,220
Perfect gown and
picture-perfect honeymoon..

1696
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:29,316
In which your less than perfect
boyfriend was paying the bills?

1697
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:31,355
- And when Jerry needed my help..
- Of course.

1698
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,820
- It was Jerry's idea.
- Wake up, Radhika.

1699
01:35:35,772 --> 01:35:37,365
Today Veer is in a foster home.

1700
01:35:39,901 --> 01:35:44,748
And the truth is I can become
a male escort for Jerry a 100 times.

1701
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:54,966
Radhika Awasthi, people can survive
on chicken roll all their life.

1702
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,335
"The distance
between truth and dreams."

1703
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,337
"How will I cover that distance?"

1704
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:02,261
"But this journey is half mine."

1705
01:36:02,382 --> 01:36:04,931
"And half yours."

1706
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:14,357
"I am standing in your path."

1707
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:19,783
"Shattered, broken and alone."

1708
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:25,614
"I admit I made a mistake."

1709
01:36:26,155 --> 01:36:30,956
"But you are generous."

1710
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:33,747
Coffee?

1711
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:39,886
- Father, am I selfish?
- Who said that?

1712
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:41,300
Nick.

1713
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,466
If Nick said it then it must be true.

1714
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:46,976
You always favor Nick.

1715
01:36:47,343 --> 01:36:50,438
Radhika, if Nick isn't
perfect then neither are you.

1716
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:54,521
The problem is that we often
make mistakes in relationships..

1717
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:57,361
But we never apologize.

1718
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:59,697
Even I hurt your mother.

1719
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:04,407
But.. I delayed in apologizing.

1720
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:06,579
Apologies only add to the love.

1721
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:12,244
And anyway, one mistake should
be forgiven in every relationship.

1722
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:15,004
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

1723
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:16,247
Relax.

1724
01:37:22,503 --> 01:37:25,097
Come on, Jerry. You
finally got a degree.

1725
01:37:28,051 --> 01:37:29,223
Hotness.

1726
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,687
Not bad, Jerry Patel.

1727
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:32,271
An A in Economics.

1728
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:35,141
Even the Cardinal ensured I passed.

1729
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,609
Thank you, sir.

1730
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,733
For the first time in life
someone had confidence that..

1731
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,070
I could do something.

1732
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:42,486
Thanks, Tanya.

1733
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:44,571
Relax.

1734
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:48,287
And that's not true.

1735
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:50,414
I am not the only one
who believes in you.

1736
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:53,375
Look.

1737
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,808
My mother.

1738
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:18,484
My mother.

1739
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:19,985
My mother.

1740
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:22,356
Jiggu. Jiggu.

1741
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:26,701
Mother, I missed you.

1742
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:32,161
Jiggu. You really passed.

1743
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:34,454
Look. Look. Here's the degree.

1744
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,411
And I did it without him.

1745
01:38:37,203 --> 01:38:39,171
See, aunt. I told you.

1746
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:41,298
He doesn't calm down easily.

1747
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:43,134
Mother, ask him to get out.

1748
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:45,219
Jiggu, come here.

1749
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:47,964
What are you doing, mother?

1750
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:50,717
At this age, people come
to meet their grandchildren.

1751
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,686
And look at me, I am here to
collect my son's report card.

1752
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:56,105
You were right..
In throwing him out of the house.

1753
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:57,394
You did the right thing.

1754
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,267
Otherwise he would've been
working as a guard somewhere.

1755
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:00,894
I would've been
a security consultant.

1756
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,108
And, aunt. He slapped me.

1757
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:04,648
Slapped me.

1758
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:06,281
Shut up.

1759
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:08,568
Aren't you ashamed?

1760
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,987
Your friendship dates back 15 years!

1761
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:14,161
Shake hands.

1762
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:18,670
You know, Jiggu.

1763
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:23,041
Your friend here
called me, looking for you.

1764
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:25,881
And he brought me here to say sorry.

1765
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:27,966
Forgive him.

1766
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:29,179
Forgive him.

1767
01:39:29,422 --> 01:39:31,641
Look, if you don't forgive
him today..

1768
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:36,312
I will feel that I shouldn't
have given birth to you.

1769
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:38,439
What are you saying?

1770
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:39,682
Then forgive him.

1771
01:39:39,849 --> 01:39:42,068
I still have to shop.
I don't have the time, son.

1772
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:52,403
Fool, you can bring
mother here, go meet Veer..

1773
01:39:52,528 --> 01:39:53,996
But couldn't give me a call.

1774
01:39:54,113 --> 01:39:55,911
I was tired of
saying sorry to everyone.

1775
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:58,667
Radhika.

1776
01:39:58,784 --> 01:39:59,910
Forget it.

1777
01:40:00,036 --> 01:40:01,162
I missed you.

1778
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:04,211
Forget it. - You were busy
with your private tuitions.

1779
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:06,755
Hello, aunt.

1780
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:08,093
Mother, my teacher.

1781
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:10,220
- She's still a teacher.
- What is this, mother?

1782
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:12,632
- Can you cook?
- What are you saying, mother?

1783
01:40:12,798 --> 01:40:13,970
I'm just asking.

1784
01:40:14,133 --> 01:40:16,135
I can cook food.

1785
01:40:16,761 --> 01:40:18,104
Gujarati daughter-in-law.

1786
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:19,931
Gujarati..

1787
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,267
You know Gujarati?

1788
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:37,665
Everyone here looks like an MBA.

1789
01:40:38,366 --> 01:40:40,334
I don't think
I will get a job here.

1790
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:43,121
Three firms have already
rejected you.

1791
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:44,956
Now listen to me.

1792
01:40:45,081 --> 01:40:47,300
- It's a fool proof plan.
- It's a useless idea.

1793
01:40:47,542 --> 01:40:49,886
Don't spend too much time
with that cartoon. - Who?

1794
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,546
That Radhika's dad.

1795
01:40:51,837 --> 01:40:54,386
- Mr. Patel.
- Yes, that's me.

1796
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:56,763
Think about it, Jerry.

1797
01:40:58,678 --> 01:41:02,478
Security guard. Burger joint.

1798
01:41:05,685 --> 01:41:08,905
You just completed your
graduation two weeks ago..

1799
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:11,316
And you are applying
for the post of an analyst?

1800
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:13,234
Very ambitious, I must say.

1801
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:17,288
Sir, my resume can only
tell you what I used to be.

1802
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:19,244
And not the things that I can be.

1803
01:41:19,365 --> 01:41:20,537
I just need one chance, sir.

1804
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:21,792
To prove myself.

1805
01:41:21,993 --> 01:41:24,166
That means you want
to learn from us..

1806
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:26,255
And for that
we will have to pay you.

1807
01:41:26,622 --> 01:41:27,714
I am sorry.

1808
01:41:27,832 --> 01:41:29,675
But all the
candidate sitting outside..

1809
01:41:29,834 --> 01:41:31,211
Are more qualified than you.

1810
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:33,178
Please don't waste my time.

1811
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:39,802
Raj.

1812
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:47,602
We will meet this
evening in the golf club.

1813
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:49,775
See you, buddy.

1814
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:51,439
And let's get it drink after that.

1815
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:53,365
- Bye.
- No!

1816
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:56,493
Why are you beating me, Mr. Dillion?

1817
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,571
I just came here to ask for a job.

1818
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:01,324
Leave me, what are you doing?

1819
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:03,584
Don't touch me.

1820
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:04,998
I'm not touching you.

1821
01:42:04,999 --> 01:42:06,211
Leave me.

1822
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:08,043
I'm not holding you.

1823
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:11,630
Stay away from me.

1824
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:14,675
God! My encyclopedia.

1825
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:18,724
Get your hands off of me.

1826
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,518
No, no, no. Not my fish tank.

1827
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,057
Don't drown me in the water.
I cannot swim.

1828
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:30,028
Stop Finding Nemo In My Fish Tank.

1829
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:36,571
Look, you need counseling..

1830
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:38,987
And I need a blood
pressure measuring machine.

1831
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:42,578
- Help me.
- Help me. Help me.

1832
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:46,168
Help me. Close your zip Mr. Dillion?

1833
01:42:46,786 --> 01:42:48,379
Save me from this man..

1834
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:02,848
- I have called the police.
- Please.

1835
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:06,264
Please don't call the police.
I'll lose my job.

1836
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:08,765
How many years will
he have to serve..

1837
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:11,770
- For assault and violence?
- At least 10 years.

1838
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:13,396
By the time he comes out..

1839
01:43:13,521 --> 01:43:14,738
His wife will be
married for the second time..

1840
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:16,152
And his son for the first time.

1841
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:18,150
No, no, please.

1842
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:20,244
I'm ready to do anything you want.

1843
01:43:20,361 --> 01:43:21,738
I'll give you the
post of senior analyst.

1844
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,738
It's all yours.

1845
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:28,245
No. I'll become the senior
analyst on my own merit.

1846
01:43:28,911 --> 01:43:30,413
I just request you..

1847
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:33,832
To consider me for the more
junior position in this company.

1848
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:37,588
- Please.
- Is this a request or a threat?

1849
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:38,796
<i>I'll</i> tell you.

1850
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,173
No, no. Just want to know.

1851
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:44,302
His starting salary will
be 40,000 pounds plus bonus.

1852
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:47,604
An individual office, and
one month holiday a year.

1853
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:52,314
And don't ever discuss
this incident again.

1854
01:43:54,854 --> 01:43:56,777
This is called threatening.

1855
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:04,497
Who are you? - I am his
brother from a hotter mother.

1856
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:06,620
Come, J.

1857
01:44:20,588 --> 01:44:23,717
Now you wear a suit and go to work
every day. You will pay the rent.

1858
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:26,682
And I will sit at home and
play PlayStation with Veer.

1859
01:44:26,802 --> 01:44:29,726
- But Veer hasn't returned home yet.
- Come on, J.

1860
01:44:29,889 --> 01:44:32,187
You have a degree, a job
and an Economics professor..

1861
01:44:32,308 --> 01:44:33,725
Is crazy about you.

1862
01:44:33,726 --> 01:44:35,820
Even the judge will get a complex.

1863
01:44:36,395 --> 01:44:38,648
- 3 o'clock.
- You're still staring at girls.

1864
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:40,782
Take a look. She is just your type.

1865
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:48,707
What is she here to
say after four months?

1866
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:50,747
So should I tell her
that you aren't interested?

1867
01:44:50,868 --> 01:44:53,337
I'm not even interested in
what you want to tell her.

1868
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:54,873
<i>Okay.</i>

1869
01:44:56,499 --> 01:44:57,671
Jerry, you're late.

1870
01:44:57,792 --> 01:44:59,840
You called me here at <i>7</i> o'clock.

1871
01:45:00,252 --> 01:45:02,175
How much did you drink?

1872
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:05,341
Who the hell drinks to tolerate?

1873
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:10,355
I drink to sit here. Look at Nick.

1874
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,182
And tolerate you.

1875
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:16,644
Stop your charade..

1876
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:18,609
- He is dying to meet you.
- Really?

1877
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:19,730
I have set everything up.

1878
01:45:19,731 --> 01:45:22,233
Just show your dimples.. Your hair.

1879
01:45:22,358 --> 01:45:23,860
And that will melt him. Understand.

1880
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:26,778
And anyway, he
doesn't stare at any girl.

1881
01:45:26,779 --> 01:45:28,281
Open wide.

1882
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:32,747
But girls can look at him.

1883
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,628
Darn it, she's hot.

1884
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:40,676
Your time starts now.

1885
01:45:43,754 --> 01:45:45,427
If you are not going to marry her..

1886
01:45:45,631 --> 01:45:46,757
Can we go for dinner tomorrow?

1887
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,384
- Do you know her?
- No.

1888
01:45:49,385 --> 01:45:51,386
I am 5 ft. 7, you seem 6 ft.

1889
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:53,355
We'll look fabulous together.

1890
01:45:53,472 --> 01:45:55,520
Would you please leave us alone?

1891
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:57,735
After marriage, a house
in Hampstead, two cars..

1892
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:01,488
- Two children, the perfect life.
- What is your problem?

1893
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:05,242
One slap and you will never
need any plastic surgery again.

1894
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:06,573
Buzz off.

1895
01:46:06,694 --> 01:46:09,573
Bravo. Indian woman.

1896
01:46:10,823 --> 01:46:12,496
Crazy woman.

1897
01:46:18,289 --> 01:46:20,667
Nick. Please marry me.

1898
01:46:23,502 --> 01:46:25,675
I don't have money, house or a job.

1899
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:28,723
I can't give you the life you want.

1900
01:46:28,841 --> 01:46:31,685
Nick, I can spend my
entire life eating chicken roll.

1901
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:33,729
But there is no fun
in eating it alone.

1902
01:46:33,846 --> 01:46:38,522
- Fine. First job then marriage.
- Done.

1903
01:46:38,684 --> 01:46:40,652
- No honeymoon.
- No honeymoon.

1904
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:43,272
We will live in my
trailer until we get a house.

1905
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:44,611
Now you are pushing it.

1906
01:46:44,732 --> 01:46:47,406
I don't have the money
to feed you every day.

1907
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:49,536
Come aboard if you want to..

1908
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:51,914
Or else I will call back the
blonde. - Don't be so pushy.

1909
01:46:52,281 --> 01:46:53,328
You don't have a job,
a home nor money.

1910
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:54,412
At least you have a girlfriend.

1911
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:56,376
She's getting hooked
for less, say yes.

1912
01:46:56,535 --> 01:46:58,208
- You are saying this?
- Say yes to her.

1913
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:05,461
Do you always keep this with you?

1914
01:47:05,586 --> 01:47:07,714
I wanted to sell this today.

1915
01:47:07,838 --> 01:47:09,306
And I met you.

1916
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:21,398
They made me emotional.

1917
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:24,772
I can't handle <i>so</i> much happiness.

1918
01:47:29,234 --> 01:47:32,283
J, the real test begins now.

1919
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:33,701
Ready?

1920
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,497
Ready.

1921
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:44,540
Case 463.

1922
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:46,459
State versus Jerry Patel.

1923
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,428
The prosecution and the defense..

1924
01:47:48,545 --> 01:47:51,344
Have stated Hindi as
their preferred language.

1925
01:47:51,507 --> 01:47:53,259
Will the defense
please present their case?

1926
01:47:53,384 --> 01:47:55,807
Your Honor, today when
I stepped out of the house..

1927
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:59,315
I told my mom 'Mom, I will
be home for lunch' because..

1928
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:02,310
Frankly the
prosecution doesn't have a case.

1929
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:05,316
- Who have you brought?
- He was the only one free.

1930
01:48:05,437 --> 01:48:07,314
Few months ago due to
the job status..

1931
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:08,778
Of my client, Jerry Patel..

1932
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:11,865
Social Services placed
Veer in a foster home.

1933
01:48:12,611 --> 01:48:16,286
Today, Jerry has
successfully changed his life.

1934
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:19,326
And as Veer's legal guardian..

1935
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:22,671
He wants to challenge the
decision of the Social Services.

1936
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:25,499
Will the representing lawyer
from the Social Services..

1937
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:27,467
Please present their case?

1938
01:48:30,963 --> 01:48:34,308
Oh no, Jerry. I'm saying
sorry in advance. - Why?

1939
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:36,509
- Vijay-
- Vijay?

1940
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:39,434
Ajay. Vijay. Dhananjay.

1941
01:48:39,722 --> 01:48:41,472
You can call me anything..

1942
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:44,443
But today after this case is over..

1943
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:47,484
Every person sitting
here will remember..

1944
01:48:47,604 --> 01:48:50,483
Ajay Bapat's name.

1945
01:48:50,649 --> 01:48:52,401
Who is this cartoon?

1946
01:48:52,484 --> 01:48:54,202
Pogo channel's brand ambassador.

1947
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:56,287
Your honor, don't be fooled..

1948
01:48:56,447 --> 01:48:59,496
By this super-duper handsome,
stud and innocent face.

1949
01:48:59,616 --> 01:49:04,662
Hiding behind this mask is an
irresponsible and immoral man.

1950
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:06,415
And his friend is a thief as well.

1951
01:49:06,623 --> 01:49:09,467
He steals others girlfriends
in broad daylight. - Bapat.

1952
01:49:10,627 --> 01:49:12,755
Mr. Bapat, please keep
your personal life..

1953
01:49:12,921 --> 01:49:15,265
- Out of this courtroom.
- Apologies.

1954
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:19,808
But in the next few minutes
I will prove to everyone that..

1955
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:25,227
Jerry needs a foster
home more than Veer does.

1956
01:49:25,476 --> 01:49:27,729
Your honor, this
happened on 13th November..

1957
01:49:27,853 --> 01:49:33,451
When Jerry all night,
along with three clients..

1958
01:49:44,828 --> 01:49:47,581
- Did I miss something?
- No, dear, it just started.

1959
01:49:47,706 --> 01:49:49,253
You didn't bring popcorn?

1960
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:50,713
Snacks or hotdog.

1961
01:49:52,419 --> 01:49:54,547
Hey, Jerry Betty...

1962
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:56,841
Nick, I am saying sorry in advance.

1963
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:58,383
Jerry, we had a rule.

1964
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:03,554
When a man like Jerry
spends the entire night..

1965
01:50:03,555 --> 01:50:07,685
With such an
amazingly beautiful girl..

1966
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:10,695
Then obviously they
weren't playing carom.

1967
01:50:10,771 --> 01:50:13,615
Did you or did you
not pay this man money?

1968
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:15,359
Of course I had to.

1969
01:50:15,484 --> 01:50:19,409
We had so much fun and
he was so good at it.

1970
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:24,372
We would all love to
know what he is so good at.

1971
01:50:24,493 --> 01:50:27,292
- Rummy, baby.
- What?

1972
01:50:27,412 --> 01:50:29,335
The poor girl lost a
fortune after that.

1973
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:32,166
If it wasn't for my man Jerry..

1974
01:50:32,167 --> 01:50:33,840
I would've kept living a lie.

1975
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:38,807
But thanks to him, I
can proudly say, I'm gay.

1976
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:41,310
I knew it. So he did sleep with you.

1977
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:42,727
No.

1978
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:45,598
But he did ask me
three simple questions.

1979
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:48,358
- What questions?
- Who are your best friends?

1980
01:50:48,517 --> 01:50:50,315
Kalpana, Sweety, Pinky, Pammy.

1981
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:52,312
Lovlina, Hrithik and Kookie.
My seven sisters.

1982
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:53,404
What is your favorite song?

1983
01:50:53,522 --> 01:50:59,370
'The only crime that
I commit is that..'

1984
01:50:59,486 --> 01:51:04,663
'I am a man and I love all men.'

1985
01:51:04,825 --> 01:51:06,543
Congratulations, Mr. Bapat.

1986
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,583
You are officially gay.

1987
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:10,713
Mr. Bapat, do I need
to remind you that..

1988
01:51:10,873 --> 01:51:14,417
You are defending against
Mr. Patel and not for him?

1989
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:16,887
There is nothing wrong
in it. But you are gay.

1990
01:51:18,255 --> 01:51:22,300
I was lonely and
I hired a male escort.

1991
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:24,349
That's how Jerry came to
spend the night at my house.

1992
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:28,599
Yes, yes. And you lost money
in rummy, or was it scrabble?

1993
01:51:30,767 --> 01:51:33,395
Or did you play in a dark room?

1994
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,408
Silence means guilt.

1995
01:51:38,525 --> 01:51:40,778
- And guilt means..
- Objection, your Honor.

1996
01:51:40,903 --> 01:51:42,403
He is harassing the witness.

1997
01:51:42,404 --> 01:51:43,530
Objection over-ruled.

1998
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:45,290
The witness will have to speak up.

1999
01:51:45,407 --> 01:51:47,284
Call your mother and tell her that..

2000
01:51:47,451 --> 01:51:48,919
You won't be back before dinner.

2001
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:51,956
Now, Mrs. Smith, may
I remind you that..

2002
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:53,248
You are under oath?

2003
01:51:53,415 --> 01:51:57,795
Now please tell me why you
paid that man on November 30th?

2004
01:52:00,255 --> 01:52:03,725
Your Honor, we did
have sex that night.

2005
01:52:03,884 --> 01:52:06,307
I won. I won. I won.

2006
01:52:06,428 --> 01:52:08,977
Thank you, lonely woman.

2007
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:11,900
Jerry, I know you didn't want to.

2008
01:52:12,017 --> 01:52:14,691
But you understood the
emptiness of my life.

2009
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:17,318
You were a friend to me that night.

2010
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:19,398
I wish I could help you.

2011
01:52:19,399 --> 01:52:21,322
Jerry, I am so sorry.

2012
01:52:22,486 --> 01:52:24,580
Your Honor, it proves that..

2013
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:29,369
Jerry isn't just a mere
publican but the king of vulgarism.

2014
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:36,751
"I am your hero. Listen, rich guys."

2015
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:40,379
"I am the man of God. I
am everybody's friend."

2016
01:52:40,545 --> 01:52:43,298
"I see each corner of the world."

2017
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:45,391
Don't you feel sir's
biceps have increased?

2018
01:52:45,509 --> 01:52:46,681
Must be the demand of the clients.

2019
01:52:46,843 --> 01:52:49,562
"I splurged money.
Life taught me a lesson."

2020
01:52:49,721 --> 01:52:51,348
"I slept on the moon."

2021
01:52:51,473 --> 01:52:53,225
"I told the sun."

2022
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:56,271
"To bring a superb morning."

2023
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:58,397
This is a court room
and not your living room.

2024
01:52:58,563 --> 01:52:59,655
You are breaking the law.

2025
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:01,158
It's an old habit, your honor.

2026
01:53:01,316 --> 01:53:02,909
I have been doing
that since childhood.

2027
01:53:03,527 --> 01:53:05,495
Jerry's case is strong.

2028
01:53:05,612 --> 01:53:07,410
But short of witnesses.

2029
01:53:07,906 --> 01:53:10,116
- May I take the stand?
- But who are?

2030
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:12,245
I am London's highest paid lover..

2031
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:17,417
Who spreads happiness
to every women in London.

2032
01:53:17,582 --> 01:53:18,754
Without clothes.

2033
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:20,843
This is who Jerry
really is, your honor.

2034
01:53:20,961 --> 01:53:23,714
He failed in every job in the world.

2035
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:26,349
Because he's only good
at taking off his clothes.

2036
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:29,345
Shorty, anyone can become a lawyer..

2037
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:31,688
After writing 15-20 exams.

2038
01:53:32,306 --> 01:53:33,774
But no book in the world..

2039
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:36,359
Can teach you to make
a woman happy.

2040
01:53:36,685 --> 01:53:39,985
For that you need
pedigree and not a degree.

2041
01:53:40,105 --> 01:53:41,482
I'll ask for a card.

2042
01:53:42,107 --> 01:53:44,280
He gave it last time,
but I didn't get it.

2043
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:47,617
And only a woman can
understand that.

2044
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:52,538
A mother feels happy when her
child stands first in the exams.

2045
01:53:53,327 --> 01:53:54,544
A sister feels happy..

2046
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:57,752
When her brother is
promoted in the office.

2047
01:53:58,457 --> 01:53:59,674
A wife feels happy.

2048
01:53:59,791 --> 01:54:02,260
When her husband brings
money home.

2049
01:54:02,419 --> 01:54:04,137
But a woman feels happy..

2050
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:07,348
When the owner of Desi
Boyz hands her his card.

2051
01:54:10,218 --> 01:54:11,470
Objection, your honor.

2052
01:54:11,636 --> 01:54:14,185
- He is breaking the law.
- Over-ruled.

2053
01:54:15,682 --> 01:54:17,434
Think about it, Bapat.

2054
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:20,779
They only brought
happiness to the ladies.

2055
01:54:22,189 --> 01:54:24,533
Many people even commit
murder for their children.

2056
01:54:24,649 --> 01:54:26,242
Mr. Desi Boyz.

2057
01:54:26,401 --> 01:54:27,869
Explain to me the meaning of..

2058
01:54:28,028 --> 01:54:30,122
Spreading happiness to the ladies.

2059
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:31,660
Bapat, my boy...

2060
01:54:31,865 --> 01:54:33,333
Have you ever thought..

2061
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:36,294
Why do your seven
sisters smile <i>so</i> much?

2062
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:41,378
- Sir, card please.
- Dad.

2063
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:43,509
Oh I got his card.
I got his card finally.

2064
01:54:43,668 --> 01:54:45,966
Please maintain
decorum in the courtroom.

2065
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:51,393
Your honor.

2066
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:54,855
You only heard and saw
the witnesses from my past.

2067
01:54:56,098 --> 01:55:00,399
But no one said
anything about my present.

2068
01:55:00,769 --> 01:55:03,067
And I have just one request to make.

2069
01:55:03,271 --> 01:55:08,243
Base your decision on my
present and not my past.

2070
01:55:09,653 --> 01:55:10,825
That's it.

2071
01:55:10,987 --> 01:55:12,330
Ma)! I. your honor?

2072
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:16,247
People become a father
after getting a child.

2073
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:21,465
But that small Veer has
turned Jerry into a man.

2074
01:55:22,082 --> 01:55:24,255
And even good people make mistakes.

2075
01:55:24,376 --> 01:55:26,470
But it's a bigger crime..

2076
01:55:26,586 --> 01:55:29,931
If you don't give him an
opportunity to rectify that mistake..

2077
01:55:30,549 --> 01:55:32,096
That's all, your honor.

2078
01:55:32,884 --> 01:55:34,101
Thank you.

2079
01:55:39,474 --> 01:55:44,776
The court grants Veer's custody..

2080
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:47,987
To his father, Jerry Patel.

2081
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:12,762
Jerry.

2082
01:57:10,065 --> 01:57:12,159
Clap your hands,
whistle all you want.

2083
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:14,612
My Desi Boyz have returned.

2084
01:57:15,195 --> 01:57:17,869
You used to rule
the hearts of girls.

2085
01:57:17,989 --> 01:57:20,583
Rocco and Hunter are really naughty.

2086
01:57:20,825 --> 01:57:23,044
And soon all of India
will know this.

2087
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:26,047
I have obtained the
license for Mumbai branch.

2088
01:57:26,581 --> 01:57:29,084
- Pack your bags, boys.
- Okay, sir.

2089
01:57:29,209 --> 01:57:33,510
The women of Mumbai want to
see Batman and Robin at the dorm.

2090
01:57:34,214 --> 01:57:36,137
- Robin, Batman.
- I don't want to be Robin.

2091
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:38,727
You will look better than
Batman in Robin's outfit.

2092
01:57:38,843 --> 01:57:41,221
- No, I don't want to be Robin.
- Are you crazy? Don't whine.

2093
01:57:41,429 --> 01:57:44,023
- Fine, be Superman.
- Okay.

2094
01:57:44,182 --> 01:57:46,605
"Make some noise for
the Indian boys."

2095
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:49,692
"The boys."

2096
01:57:49,813 --> 01:57:51,315
Don't whine, take this.

2097
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:53,358
"The boys."

2098
01:58:11,293 --> 01:58:13,546
"Let's go. Come on.
Heart of girls.."

2099
01:58:13,712 --> 01:58:15,305
Ba pat.

2100
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:19,889
"We will break the
record of Romeo's love."

2101
01:58:20,051 --> 01:58:21,928
You could have called.

2102
01:58:22,053 --> 01:58:23,851
- Do you want to kiss me?
- Here.

2103
01:58:24,222 --> 01:58:25,849
I have never..

2104
01:58:26,391 --> 01:58:28,018
- What's this..
- Oh no.

2105
01:58:28,226 --> 01:58:31,275
"My heart is very decent."

2106
01:58:31,396 --> 01:58:34,741
"Make some noise for the
Indian boys. One. Two. Three. Go."

2107
01:58:34,899 --> 01:58:37,277
"English moves."

2108
01:58:40,822 --> 01:58:42,324
I would've been
a security consultant.

2109
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:43,701
Cut, cut.

2110
01:58:43,867 --> 01:58:47,041
I want to fly like a free bird.

2111
01:58:47,162 --> 01:58:49,335
Higher, Ajay. Higher.
Higher. Higher.

2112
01:58:49,456 --> 01:58:50,799
I have known you for three years.

2113
01:58:52,459 --> 01:58:54,837
I have known you for three years.
I know when you are faking it.

2114
01:58:55,003 --> 01:58:58,428
"Dressing up handsomely
and flaunting their muscles."

2115
01:58:58,548 --> 01:59:01,017
"Indian boys dance merrily."

2116
01:59:01,176 --> 01:59:03,645
- Who, we?
- You and me.

2117
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:06,314
- Rick and Rocco..
- Who are Rick and Rocco?

2118
01:59:12,395 --> 01:59:13,863
I am MBA from the..

2119
01:59:15,857 --> 01:59:17,655
Don't get ambitious.

2120
01:59:22,322 --> 01:59:24,245
"They say Lady Gaga is our fan."

2121
01:59:24,366 --> 01:59:25,618
Sorry.

2122
01:59:30,413 --> 01:59:31,881
Order the food only when..

2123
01:59:33,833 --> 01:59:35,460
Stay away from me.

2124
01:59:36,503 --> 01:59:38,801
"The Indian boys.
One. Two. Three. Go."

2125
01:59:39,172 --> 01:59:42,426
"English moves on the
rhythm of the heart."

2126
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:45,554
"Indian boys dance merrily."

2127
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:49,224
If I slap you, you will start..

2128
01:59:50,475 --> 01:59:54,605
Yes, you might have
a body but I have a..

2129
01:59:56,731 --> 01:59:59,280
Finals in five minutes, get up.

2130
01:59:59,442 --> 02:00:01,695
- Get up, Jerry.
- Don't go.

2131
02:00:04,781 --> 02:00:06,875
A girl's wedding..

2132
02:00:08,493 --> 02:00:10,621
A girl's wedding..

2133
02:00:10,745 --> 02:00:13,749
"In the window opposite yours."

2134
02:00:14,582 --> 02:00:19,429
"Come back. Amazing! Come on!"

2135
02:00:19,546 --> 02:00:22,881
"It's women's weakness. They
splurge their wealth on us."

2136
02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:24,634
"Fighting for us."

2137
02:00:24,801 --> 02:00:26,394
Nice job.

2138
02:00:27,762 --> 02:00:29,730
And a doggy. Bow wow.

2139
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:30,807
One second. Sorry.

2140
02:00:31,224 --> 02:00:32,316
I have set up everything.

2141
02:00:32,434 --> 02:00:34,687
And anyway, he doesn't meet
any girl.. What is wrong with me?

2142
02:00:34,853 --> 02:00:36,446
Ba pat.

2143
02:00:39,149 --> 02:00:40,696
I'm learning to speak the truth.

2144
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:43,203
"The Indian boys.
One. Two. Three. Sing."

2145
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:46,535
"English moves on the
rhythm of the heart."

2146
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:49,742
"Indian boys dance merrily."

2147
02:00:49,743 --> 02:00:53,373
"Dressing up handsomely
and flaunting their muscles."

2148
02:00:53,496 --> 02:00:56,625
"Indian boys dance merrily."

2149
02:00:56,750 --> 02:01:00,175
"Seeing the corners of the world."

2150
02:01:00,295 --> 02:01:03,390
"Indian boys are the best."

2151
02:01:03,548 --> 02:01:06,677
"Raise your voice. Make some noise."

2152
02:01:06,801 --> 02:01:10,396
"Indian boys have come for you."

2153
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:25,403
Please maintain
decorum in the courtroom.
