1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,840
'No character in this film'

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,960
'represents the community
he or she comes from.'

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,520
'His or her views are limited
to that character only.'

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,240
'This film respects
all religious faiths.'

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,920
'It does not intend to hurt
the sentiments of any religion.'

6
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,280
'Separated, God'

7
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,960
What's the word if we place
a dot here? - 'God.'

8
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,840
And what's it if we place
a dot here? - 'Separated.'

9
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,440
"Everybody came from the same place"

10
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,800
"to tread the same path."

11
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
"Half way along, some misgiving"

12
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,040
"caused everyone to go
their separate ways."

13
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,880
"Where do you come from,
where do you have to go?"

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,280
"That's what you need to know."

15
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,720
"Find a good Guru to guide you,"

16
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,960
"to open the window to your soul."

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,840
"and make you forget
your differences."

18
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,080
"Both Hindus and Muslims are deluded."

19
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,720
"Always fighting each other."

20
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,600
"Both Hindus and Muslims are deluded."

21
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,880
"Always fighting each other."

22
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,960
"Be it Yogis, rich or poor people,"

23
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,560
"everyone is lost in greed."

24
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,680
"Everyone is lost in greed."

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,120
"Where do you come from,
where do you have to go?"

26
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,680
"That's what you need to know."

27
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,440
"Find a good Guru to guide you,"

28
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,880
"to open the window to your soul."

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,160
"and make you forget your differences."

30
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,240
Come here. Buy my wares for cheap.

31
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,320
Shahid, all these people are
accused of being Muslims.

32
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,520
Unfortunately, they're not.

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,520
Wearing kurta-pajama,

34
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,520
a cheap hat

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,200
and flocking the streets
on Friday to offer prayers

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,040
doesn't make one a Muslim.

37
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
The parents make their
children memorise

38
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,640
the verses of the Quran in Arabic,

39
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,400
but they don't know the meaning.

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,760
If they did,

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,840
Muslims wouldn't be
in this deplorable state.

42
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,320
We would have fought for our place.

43
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,840
And we will.

44
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,600
We'll fight and get our
rightful place, God willing.

45
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,080
God willing.

46
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,720
'It's the ultimate truth.'

47
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,960
'The name of the Lord is the truth.'

48
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,320
'It's the ultimate truth.'

49
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,640
'The name of the Lord is the truth.'

50
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,960
'It's the ultimate truth.'

51
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
'The name of the Lord is the truth.'

52
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,640
'It's the ultimate truth.'

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,920
'The name of the Lord is the truth.'

54
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,240
'It's the ultimate truth.'

55
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
'The name of the Lord is the truth.'

56
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,880
'It's the ultimate truth.'

57
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,200
'The name of the Lord is the truth.'

58
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,640
'It's the ultimate truth.'

59
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,080
'The name of the Lord is the truth.'

60
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,120
'May the peace and mercy of Allah
be with you too.'

61
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,680
'Stop right there, fatso!'

62
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,840
'Good morning, Varanasi.'

63
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,280
'I'm your beloved RJ Prerna.'

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,960
'So, let's start the first song.'

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,360
"If you were a city full
of crisscrossing streets,"

66
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,320
"I wouldn't mind getting lost in you."

67
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,040
"I like the way you talk,"

68
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,320
"and your eyes are spellbinding."

69
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,760
You roam around all night on
your motorbike these days.

70
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,640
Stop doing that and sit at the
shop, or else get out of my house.

71
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
I don't want to sell 'paan'.

72
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,040
Do you want to be a goldsmith then?

73
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm trying to make ends meet,

74
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,280
and you want a life of luxury.

75
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,320
Greetings, Mr Chaubey.
- Greetings...

76
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,120
What are you doing, Sonkar?

77
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,840
We must keep India clean.

78
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,080
Move it!
- I'll tell mom you hit me.

79
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,800
Hey, don't tell mom.

80
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,160
Hey, Sonkar!

81
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,560
Mr Chaubey's son looks more
like you, rather than his father.

82
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,280
Lallan, even you look like me.

83
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,400
Are you opening up late today?

84
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,640
Lallan, the advocate is here too.

85
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,680
Hey, Chutkan. I'm here.
- Hello!

86
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,640
Greetings, Kanhaiya.

87
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
Greetings, sir.
- May you be at peace.

88
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,640
I got you the medication
for constipation. - Okay.

89
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,960
This is what you have to do.
You must take four tablets

90
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,320
four times a day.

91
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Got it?
- Four times.

92
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,640
Very well.
- Here's your tea, sir.

93
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,600
Yes.

94
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,480
Would you like to
place a bet for Rs 100?

95
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
On what?

96
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,240
Australia will beat India tomorrow.

97
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,800
India cannot lose.

98
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,080
Counsellor!
- Welcome, Mr Chaubey.

99
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,560
Don't place any bets with Lallan.

100
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,880
He never loses a bet.

101
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,640
Greetings!
- Who's that?

102
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Oh! You got such a lot of bread
early in the morning, Farhad.

103
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,600
The feat is in the evening.
- Actually...

104
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
Spit the 'paan' out first.

105
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,920
He says that aunt needed it early.
- Have a 'paan'.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
I will bring fresh bread later in
the evening for the feast.

107
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Aayat.

108
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,600
Aayat!

109
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,160
Rashid, please keep
the bread in the kitchen.

110
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,240
Okay.

111
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,720
Rashid.
- Yes?

112
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,640
Place a newspaper under that.

113
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,280
May I say something to you?
- Yes.

114
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,160
You don't seem like yourself
when you dance.

115
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,040
Is it? So, do you like her or me?

116
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,960
Well, I like your
neighbour Tarannum too.

117
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,080
Let me tell you something.
- Aayat!

118
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,080
Uncle... Uncle is here...

119
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,520
Wear the pink dress
that I gave you on your birthday.

120
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,560
You look lovely in it.
- Aayat!

121
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,600
Rashid.
- Greetings, aunt.

122
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,920
Tell your mom to bring the drum
along in the evening. - Yes.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,760
Aayat, where is your mom?

124
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Does she need an invitation
to come downstairs?

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,240
You're here.
- Yes.

126
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,960
Do you know what time it is?
- Why?

127
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,440
I came home directly after
offering prayers.

128
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,760
Didn't you go to Kanhaiya's
tea stall to have tea?

129
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,640
Oh!
- Greetings.

130
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
Here, my child.
- Hurry up, Salim.

131
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,040
Some friends get together over
a cup of tea and chat a while.

132
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,040
But you can't take it.

133
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,240
If I couldn't take it,

134
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,080
I'd have made your life miserable
by now.

135
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,520
Don't say that, Tabassum.

136
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,840
I will marry you again.

137
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,400
You are turning 65 tomorrow.

138
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,440
And you want to marry.
- So what?

139
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,120
Choti Tabassum!
- Coming.

140
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,520
You don't do anything
except feed the birds.

141
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,040
We have to make arrangements
for the banquet this evening.

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,600
We don't have enough money to buy meat.

143
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Don't worry about the money.

144
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,000
What do you mean?

145
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,320
When we don't have money,

146
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
why should we worry about it?

147
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm coming, Tabassum.

148
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,840
I was making a list.

149
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
Where is Shahid? The lights
have to be put up as well.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,800
He was repairing Sonkar's TV
the entire night.

151
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,800
Oh!
- I don't know where he is.

152
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
Okay. How many guests are there?
- 72.

153
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,040
Greetings.

154
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,800
I heard 72.

155
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,320
There weren't as many people
at our wedding.

156
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,760
Greetings, Tabassum.

157
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,520
Greetings. - Oh! Why are the onions
cut in chunks?

158
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,560
Have you done this?

159
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,840
How much meat
do we need for the banquet?

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,880
Tell him that 30 kg will be enough.

161
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I haven't counted children.
I hope we don't fall short.

162
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,600
There's never enough when he cooks.

163
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,040
I think we should get 40 kg
should be more than enough.

164
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,560
30 kg!

165
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,240
We don't want to waste the food.

166
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
30 kg should be enough.
- Okay. I'll get 30 kg.

167
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,760
30 kg should be fine.

168
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,240
Keep this.

169
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,320
No... - Take this.
You can return it later.

170
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,200
Greetings!
- Greetings to you too.

171
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,480
Aftab had called me last night.

172
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,240
He asked me to go to the airport.

173
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,320
Aarti is coming from London
to surprise us. - Aarti!

174
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
Aarti!
- Look who is here.

175
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,960
Greetings. How are you?
- God bless you.

176
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,520
Hey...
- God bless you.

177
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
Where is Aftab?
- He is in Germany.

178
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,800
I planned this trip alone.

179
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,920
You could have called us.
- You gave us a surprise.

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,400
Did you like the surprise?
- When I saw you,

181
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,080
I wanted to scold you for coming
without informing us.

182
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,080
But now that you are
here, I'm so happy.

183
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,080
Come and give me a hug.
- Wow!

184
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,840
You are turning 65.

185
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,360
How could out get angry?
I have brought a gift for you.

186
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,920
Oh!
- What about me?

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
I have brought perfume for you.

188
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,200
Wear it in the evening.

189
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,680
Greetings.
- Greetings to you too.

190
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,200
You seem to have lost weight.

191
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,720
Even I have lost weight.

192
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Of course. That's because
you have lost a lot of hair.

193
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,320
Look at that.

194
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,080
I think she has lost weight.
- Go and make some tea.

195
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,600
I'll also have some tea.

196
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,320
What? Who will bring the meat?

197
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,360
What will we serve the guests?
- Oh, yes.

198
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,960
Go on.
- 40 kg, right?

199
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,120
30!

200
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
Yes. 30.
- He seems to have turned deaf.

201
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,280
30!

202
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,440
Uncle Bilaal!

203
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,680
Yes, come on.

204
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,200
Uncle Bilaal.

205
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,560
Take us to the street corner.
We are going to school. - Hop on.

206
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,760
Why are you going to the school
when you don't want to study?

207
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,360
Count the cash, uncle.

208
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,760
It will be demonetised soon.

209
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,720
I bet you find some way
to use the cash, Bilaal.

210
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,160
I'll lose my weight if you
make me run around.

211
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,560
What is this I hear?
- What did you hear?

212
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,280
Aftab called me.

213
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,920
I'm here to tell all of you about it.

214
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,520
Aftab and I are planning to live
separately for a couple of months.

215
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,120
I'll never be able to repay this
family for everything they gave me.

216
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,720
None of my wishes were fulfilled
by my parents.

217
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,640
But you fulfilled all my wishes.

218
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,520
But there's one thing left.

219
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,280
When I got married, my mom said,

220
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,440
'It's your responsibility to keep
the brothers together.'

221
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,200
But I couldn't do it.

222
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,880
Why? We live together, don't we?

223
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,640
You don't talk to each other.

224
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,160
What's the point of living together?

225
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,920
Forget it. Keep this money.
You might need it in the evening.

226
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,520
Take it. Come on.

227
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Bilaal is an irresponsible man.

228
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,080
Well, it's not that I don't like kids.

229
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,320
Mother keeps telling me.

230
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,240
Children...

231
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,600
Then what's the problem?

232
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,840
He wants to decide their religion

233
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
before they are born.

234
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,840
Children follow the religion

235
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,160
which their parents follow.

236
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,400
Which religion do their parents follow?

237
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,000
I remember, when I got married

238
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,280
neither Aftab nor any of you
asked me about my religion.

239
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,640
I married a human being,

240
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,680
not any religion.

241
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,480
But why does he want to place
the condition to decide

242
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,160
the religion of the children
even before they are born?

243
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,520
Mom, let Aarti get some rest.

244
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,120
So, Aarti, tell me.

245
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,600
Where should I fix these lights?

246
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Mom wanted to fix them
on the trees as well.

247
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,840
Come on, let's fix the lights.

248
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
We'll fix it everywhere.
- Yes.

249
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,560
Come on, let's decorate
the entire house.

250
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,640
Sonkar, stop smelling the food,

251
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,280
it's not in good taste.
You will spoil the korma.

252
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,840
Ali, the aroma is fantastic.

253
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,400
That's obvious.
- Tell me one thing.

254
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
Did Shrivastav's son marry a Christian?

255
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,560
You always have your eyes on
other people's wives.

256
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,080
Mr Chaubey is eating kebabs.

257
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,160
Oh! Hear this.

258
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,520
Chaubey is secretly eating kebabs.

259
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,960
He eats it every day
without his wife's knowledge.

260
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,520
Someone call Aarti.

261
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,000
Hey, Aarti.

262
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,040
"My beloved wanted my love
for only that could satisfy him."

263
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,400
"He gave the cash to the other
woman and came to me broke."

264
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
Will you be going to Kanpur
to watch the match?

265
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,280
Yes, I'll leave later tonight.

266
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,400
Wow! India will win.

267
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,040
"There was once a thief."

268
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,000
"He had a long beard."

269
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,920
"My beloved was brutal,"

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,880
"like a wild horse."

271
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,760
"He held me by my wrist."

272
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,640
"And closed his eyes."

273
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,080
"For my beloved seemed squint-eyed."

274
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,360
"Yes, he was squint-eyed."

275
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,280
"I said, I don't care."

276
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,160
"I said, I don't care."

277
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,120
"I said, I don't care."

278
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,080
"I said, I don't care."

279
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,640
"I said, I don't care."

280
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
Hey, Salim. Come here.

281
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,120
The korma is ready.
Feed it to the children first.

282
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,840
I'll go get dressed.
- Okay.

283
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,320
Hey, Vimla. You aren't eating.
- No.

284
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,880
You can't refuse. We have made
vegetarian food especially for you.

285
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,160
Choti... Here it is.

286
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,560
Have it.

287
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
We do attend their functions,

288
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,560
but we don't eat at their house.

289
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,840
"My beloved wanted to hold my hand."

290
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,760
"To spend some time together."

291
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,760
"I felt a bit shy."

292
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,920
"When he asked me
for something in the night."

293
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
"He looked innocent,"

294
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,720
"but he was quite cunning."

295
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,640
"If he was like an emperor,"

296
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,520
"I was nothing less than a queen."

297
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,480
"When he teased me,"

298
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,360
"I took him to task."

299
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,640
"But he couldn't take his eyes off me."

300
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,960
"He just couldn't."

301
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,760
"I said, you stand no chance."

302
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,400
"I said, you stand no chance."

303
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,680
Hey, keep some for Murad
in a separate bowl.

304
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,280
Or else there will be none
left for him.

305
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,880
I've already kept some aside.
One for him, and another for us.

306
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,840
Okay. Wait a minute...

307
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,320
How will you lose weight if you
don't stop doing this, uncle?

308
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,760
Aunt!
- I will... Everything is possible

309
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,480
by the will of God.

310
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,080
Yes!
- Dad.

311
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,760
Greetings.
- Come here.

312
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,320
"When I asked my wife for some love,"

313
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,360
"she demanded the whole market
in return."

314
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,160
"From gold jewellery
to pearl necklaces,"

315
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,960
"From diamond earrings
to silver anklets..."

316
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,880
"Dupattas clad with stars,"

317
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,840
"and everything was on discount."

318
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,960
"My wife's choices were lavish...'

319
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,600
"Quite Lavish...
- Oh, my God!"

320
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,440
"I said, forget it!"

321
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,360
"I said, forget it!"

322
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,280
"I said, forget it!"

323
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,200
"I said, forget it!"

324
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,080
"I said, forget it!"

325
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,080
"I said, forget it!"

326
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,040
Salim, keep another cauldron
of korma over there.

327
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,560
Everybody will pounce on the food
now. - Yes, ma'am.

328
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,720
Come on.
They have started making rotis.

329
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,160
Very good.

330
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,800
Aftab sounded sad over the phone.

331
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,320
Well, I'm not sad.

332
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,400
But the children...

333
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,200
Can we talk about this later?

334
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,080
We'll talk after you return
from the match.

335
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,520
I won't talk to mother
before you're back.

336
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,800
I promise.

337
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,400
Let's teach Chaubey a lesson.

338
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Give me a bowl of korma.

339
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Uncle...
- Father, don't...

340
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,840
Keep quiet.

341
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,360
Why are you doing this?
- Mr Chaubey...

342
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,800
Have some piping hot korma!

343
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,200
No, we're vegetarians.

344
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,800
We're vegetarians.

345
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,200
Oh, really!

346
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,640
Well, then enjoy
the bitter gourd and okra.

347
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,600
Yes...
- Don't forget to eat it.

348
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,680
Wahid!

349
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,040
Start making some dessert to go
along with the korma.

350
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,480
Why are you getting down here?

351
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Dad, I have to meet my friends here,

352
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,240
and then we'll leave for Kanpur.

353
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,520
Okay.

354
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,080
Well then...

355
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,080
Take care.
- Yes.

356
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,400
Goodbye.

357
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,240
When we went to meet the
prospective bride for Bilaal,

358
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,160
Farhad was very excited.

359
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,080
Bilaal had chosen the bride for him,

360
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,320
and he wanted revenge.

361
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,720
How was the korma?
- It was wonderful.

362
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,280
We reached her house

363
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,960
and saw her.

364
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,040
My joy knew no bounds.

365
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,320
She was extremely beautiful.

366
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,920
I asked her,

367
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,360
'What's your name?'

368
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,320
We speak to the girl to make sure

369
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,640
that she doesn't stammer.

370
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,160
So, I asked her, 'What's your name?'

371
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,360
And she said...

372
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,040
She said...

373
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,640
She said...

374
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,800
What did she say?

375
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,560
Hold on. I can't stop laughing.

376
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,240
She replied, 'I'm Tabassum.'

377
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,440
We had two women named
Tabassum in our family.

378
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,960
I was really overwhelmed.

379
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,360
And then, I said,

380
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,560
'You are Junior Tabassum
and I'm Senior Tabassum.'

381
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,480
Is that okay?

382
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,680
And then we met her...

383
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,600
When I met her, I felt,

384
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,280
she's the one who can love
Aftab more than me.

385
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,920
I never asked her anything.

386
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,960
Come and give me a hug!

387
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,320
Wonderful. God bless you!

388
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,880
Serve the coffee now.

389
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,120
If you brew it so much,
the coffee beans might spout.

390
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,280
Serve it.

391
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,200
'Incredible shot.'

392
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,520
'Beautiful timing.'

393
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,800
You seem to signal him a lot, nowadays.

394
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,560
Aayat!
- Yes, uncle.

395
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,520
Here, take this...

396
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,360
Aarti, I needed some help.
- Yes, tell me.

397
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,120
Will you please smell the milk?

398
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,840
Go ahead.

399
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,760
This is fresh milk.

400
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,880
Unlike the milk you get

401
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,360
in plastic bags and containers.

402
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,800
And you say, 'Visit London.
Life is good over there.'

403
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,960
We'll order milk from India.

404
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,200
I'll paint the shop by Eid,

405
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,440
and put up a new board.

406
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,640
You can tell your customers,

407
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,960
that your stall is opposite
Shahid Electronics.

408
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,600
Bilaal, why don't you
get me a new 4G connection?

409
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
You keep telling me
to get you a 4G connection.

410
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,560
It's going to be 6G soon.

411
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,080
'We have some breaking news.'

412
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,640
'A blast happened in Allahabad.'
- Bilaal, watch this.

413
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
'The bomb exploded inside a bus.'

414
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,680
'The bus was travelling
from Varanasi to Allahabad.'

415
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,400
'40 passengers were on board the bus.'

416
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
'The bus had departed from Varanasi.'

417
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,440
'RDX has been used, at least
10 people are presumed dead.'

418
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,360
'Please... - What about
the further investigation?'

419
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,920
'Please... Stay back.'

420
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
Mom!

421
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,560
Mom, Shahid's on TV!
- Yes...

422
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,160
Mom, Shahid's on TV!
- Where is he?

423
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,200
He's right there, on top...

424
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,520
On the right side of the screen.

425
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,240
He's in the second row.
- Exactly.

426
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,440
Didn't he just wave at us?
- Yes.

427
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,480
I can't see him. - I can't see
properly without my glasses.

428
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,040
We expected that from Aayat,
but you too, Aarti!

429
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,280
Naughty girl! There's no one here!

430
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,280
Here, have a bite, mom.
- Don't be naughty.

431
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,400
Hey, come here! He hit a six!

432
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,960
What's the score?
- 44 runs.

433
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,680
You're going to lose today.

434
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,560
How about you?
- Never against you.

435
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,960
Why not?

436
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,640
'And he went through...'

437
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,000
What's that flag on your motorcycle?

438
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,360
It's the party's flag.

439
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,880
Don't get involved in politics.

440
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,720
Stay put at the shop and help me out.

441
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,960
And earn a living.

442
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,840
Everybody can earn money, dad.

443
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,400
But very few get the opportunity

444
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,080
to work for their religion
and their nation.

445
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,560
Go and check out the news. They're
killing us in our own country.

446
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,960
And you feast at their house.

447
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,480
Get the CCTV footage
of all the private cars

448
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,120
on this road in the last one hour,
and get their details.

449
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,840
And find out how many buses
left for Allahabad from Phulpur

450
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,520
during the time of the blast.

451
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,880
Please, be quick!

452
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,720
'Sir, have you identified
the terrorists, yet?'

453
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,640
'We're checking the CCTV footage.'

454
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,240
'We'll keep you updated.'

455
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,400
'Sir, is it some
terrorist organisation...'

456
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,600
Bilaal.
- Yes.

457
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,720
We'd brought 350 SIM cards last month.

458
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,040
74 of which are in stock.

459
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,240
Which means 276 SIM cards
have been sold.

460
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,600
The money...
- What?

461
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,600
Have we received the payment?

462
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,960
I'm not talking
about the payment, Bilaal.

463
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,520
I have receipts of 262 SIM cards,

464
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,520
and 14 of them are missing.

465
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,920
How did that happen, Bilaal?

466
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,280
I never issued a SIM card
without making a receipt.

467
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,040
Come on...

468
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,240
Why don't you figure out something?

469
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,480
I know you can manage.

470
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,040
Do something about it.

471
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,920
Station our men at the hospital.

472
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,080
Look for those who have regained
their senses or are about to.

473
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,800
Ask them if they saw
any suspicious person.

474
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,160
Crosscheck that data
with the CCTV footage.

475
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,520
Sir, we've identified three
suspects from the CCTV footage.

476
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
The voice that we'd sent for sampling,

477
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,080
we suspect it is Mehfooz Alam's voice.

478
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,600
Let's go.

479
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,920
'According to our sources'

480
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,720
'the mastermind behind this blast is'

481
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
'the dreaded terrorist, Mehfooz Alam.'

482
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,800
'The police believe that the other
terrorists will be identified soon.

483
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,960
'The opposition believes that
the blast was planned'

484
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,240
'to provoke communal violence
before the upcoming elections.'

485
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,160
'But the police believes'

486
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,520
'that a Jihadist group is
responsible for the blast.'

487
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,000
Goodness gracious.

488
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,760
I wonder how they can term this jihad.

489
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,440
Do they even know the meaning of jihad?

490
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,040
Jihad means war, right?

491
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,960
Jihad means...

492
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,560
Jihad means struggle.

493
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,760
Struggle against your bad habits.

494
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,000
Struggle against injustice...

495
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,560
That is jihad.

496
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,640
'They had planted bombs
in three different buses.'

497
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,840
'The Allahabad police has issued
the photographs of 3 terrorists.'

498
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,400
'They are trying to gather
more information about them.'

499
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,600
Mom! Uncle!

500
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,600
Mom!
- What happened?

501
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,280
Uncle!
- What happened?

502
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,560
What happened, Aayat?

503
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,320
That's Shahid. A terrorist...

504
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,160
They're saying
that Shahid is a terrorist.

505
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,560
Look at those pictures...

506
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,160
What was he wearing?

507
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,560
Is it really Shahid?

508
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,200
What was he wearing?

509
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,640
'The police investigation
is in process.'

510
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,680
Was he wearing a white shirt?
What is all this, Murad?

511
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,520
Get my cell phone.

512
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,520
Chaubey... Come here quickly.
- Yes.

513
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,160
What's the matter?
- Come here, quickly!

514
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,360
What's the matter?

515
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,080
'The police has issued an alert
on the highway.'

516
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,160
Isn't that Shahid?
- Yes.

517
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,480
He's Shahid.

518
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,440
But he'd gone to Kanpur
to watch the match.

519
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,320
I wonder if Murad is aware of this.

520
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,160
It's on TV, Sonkar.

521
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,120
The whole of Varanasi has seen it.

522
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,200
Let's inform the police.

523
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,080
Are you nuts?
He's from our neighbourhood.

524
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,560
It's not about our neighbourhood.
It's about the country.

525
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Chaubey!
- 16 people are dead.

526
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,960
My son is right.

527
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,040
Driver, listen!

528
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,880
Please pull over.

529
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,560
I need to get down.

530
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,080
Goodbye.

531
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,200
Come on.

532
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,240
I got off the jeep.

533
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Leave for Bhadohi, Shahid.

534
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,320
Stay underground for a couple
of days. - Yes, Alam.

535
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,960
You did a great job.

536
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,280
Thank you, Alam.

537
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,800
The Lord is watching you.
- Correct.

538
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,680
Goodbye.

539
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,800
'We have just received news
that two boys'

540
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,560
'on board a truck travelling from
Allahabad to Phulpur'

541
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,400
'opened fire on the police and fled.'

542
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,960
What is all this, counsellor?

543
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,280
Mr Yadav...

544
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,040
That's why I'm here.

545
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,920
They haven't revealed
their names, but we suspect...

546
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,440
Are you still in doubt?

547
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,480
Chaubey!
- Who is Chaubey?

548
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,680
Do you realise what's happening?

549
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,720
What do you people not get over here?

550
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,400
Did we tell you to stay back?

551
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,320
You should have gone to Pakistan!

552
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,440
If you really like using
arms and ammunition,

553
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,360
send your children to the army.

554
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,080
Why do you kill innocent people?
- Chaubey!

555
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,200
Look at us...

556
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,760
We treat you with utmost respect.

557
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,240
We greet you with affection.
It's disgusting!

558
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,360
We've been friends for 40 years.

559
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,840
How would you feel
if you were in my shoes?

560
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,880
Think about it.
- Stop it, Chaubey.

561
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,080
'We have some breaking news.
The explosion that occurred

562
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,800
'at Hanuman Gunj bus station
near Allahabad'

563
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,240
'has left more than ten people dead
and more than 20 people injured.'

564
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
'The police suspect
this to be a terror attack'

565
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,040
'executed by three terrorists.'

566
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,440
'The police has killed two of the
terrorists in an encounter.'

567
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,880
'The third terrorist Shahid Mohammed,'

568
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,600
'is said to be a resident of
Varanasi is still absconding.'

569
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,720
'According to our sources,
he's hiding in a house in Bhadohi.'

570
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,320
'The house has been surrounded'

571
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,520
'by the police and an ATS team.'

572
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,360
Is he having breakfast?

573
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,360
Tell him SSP Danish Javed had called.

574
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,360
Come on, make way.

575
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,320
Step back.
- Come on, step back.

576
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,520
Sir, we have surrounded the house.

577
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,000
We've covered the perimeter.

578
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,200
Sir, over there...

579
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,440
They hide in such rat holes.

580
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,480
Each lane has over 100 houses,

581
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,440
and each one is filled
with kids freaking out.

582
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,240
They have always been like that.

583
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,080
I'm sorry, sir.

584
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,640
Yes, sir.

585
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,960
Keep the press
at a distance of 100 metres.

586
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,920
Is everything under control?

587
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,920
Yes, sir. It's totally under control.

588
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,400
It's a rented house.

589
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,600
We've surrounded it.

590
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,200
Come on, step back.
- Move it.

591
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,200
No, sir.
I don't need additional forces.

592
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,760
Yes.

593
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,120
Sir, if you allow him, I'll go in alone
and shoot him dead in five minutes.

594
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,720
Try to get him alive.

595
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,920
Sir, he will become a famous terrorist.

596
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,200
We'll keep making
security arrangements,

597
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,520
and he'll become a star on TV.

598
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,480
Sir, should I kill him?

599
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,800
Okay, sir.

600
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,960
Try to persuade him
to talk to his family.

601
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,680
I'll try to speak to him.

602
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,680
16 of our people are dead,
and we've to keep negotiating.

603
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,200
Hey, come here.

604
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,720
Yes, sir.
- I want a soldier on every rooftop.

605
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,920
Get it? And make sure
their guns are working.

606
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,680
Don't apologise later.
- Yes, sir.

607
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,560
Sir, there are kids
in the neighbouring house.

608
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,360
Didn't you think about it before
giving him a place to hide?

609
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,760
Evacuate the children.

610
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,720
Yes, sir.

611
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,480
SSP Mishra.

612
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,520
Anti-terrorist.

613
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,840
We need to speak to you.

614
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,120
Come in.

615
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,960
Yadav.

616
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
His life is in danger.

617
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,240
If he surrenders, he might live.

618
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,200
Shahid, I envy you.

619
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,120
The Almighty has chosen you.

620
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,920
'These are the very people who
have persecuted us for years.'

621
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,120
Accept the gift of God.

622
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,400
Don't spare anyone.

623
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,600
May the Almighty grant you success.

624
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,480
'Allah is the greatest.'

625
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,680
Start firing, young man.

626
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,200
Okay, Alam.

627
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,520
I want to hear the sound of gunfire.

628
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,960
'Allah is the greatest.'

629
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,960
'Allah is the greatest.'

630
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,480
You dare shoot at me!

631
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,360
You're from Varanasi, aren't you?

632
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,120
Have you read SSP Danish Javed's
name in the newspaper?

633
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,360
If I lose my cool,

634
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,520
I will riddle your body with bullets.

635
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,400
The police have reached your house.

636
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,720
They are requesting us
to let them talk to you.

637
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,760
If you deem fit.

638
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,760
Or else your entire family
will be killed.

639
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
You decide what to do.

640
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,880
Or else it is just you

641
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,120
and me.

642
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,240
Shahid...

643
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,120
Shahid, who set you up?

644
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,800
No one has set up.

645
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,640
All Muslims have been set up.

646
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,720
Even you have been set up.

647
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,040
You won't understand now.

648
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,200
What are you saying?

649
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,080
Son, come home and talk to us.

650
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,000
Meet us, please.
- Believe us.

651
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,960
Son, it is your father,
everything will be alright.

652
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,680
Mom, I can't come home.

653
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,120
Shahid, please come back.

654
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,640
I am waging war.

655
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,840
For all of you,

656
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,400
for our religion.

657
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,520
Shahid, what is wrong with you?

658
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,640
Son, please come home.

659
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,520
You said you would open a showroom.

660
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,720
I will help you open one.

661
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
Just come back home.
- Come back!

662
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Everything will be fine.
- Shahid.

663
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,400
Dad, there will be no showroom.

664
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,760
Until we don't defeat these infidels,

665
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,480
Muslims won't prosper.

666
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,880
Why don't you understand that there were
three Muslims among those 16 people?

667
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,560
They were not Muslims.

668
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,120
They thought they were Muslims.

669
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,320
Like you think you're a Muslim.

670
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,280
What are you saying?

671
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,240
Son, listen,
everyone loves you very much.

672
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,280
We love you a lot.

673
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,760
Your family and friends...

674
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,440
I know they say
that you are a bad person.

675
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,240
Come back home.
- Yes, son.

676
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,920
She's right, please return home.

677
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,200
All of you should be proud of me.

678
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,880
You will feel proud when you
see me in His abode.

679
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,360
I will stand proudly besides Him.

680
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,400
Goodbye.

681
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,880
Shahid!
- Shahid.

682
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,720
Son!
- Shahid!

683
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,200
Shahid.
- Shahid!

684
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,280
Dad!

685
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,320
Dad!

686
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,440
Dad!

687
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,000
Dad!

688
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,760
I'm posting some guards
outside your house.

689
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,560
Guards! But why?

690
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,880
It's needed.

691
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,920
This is my house.
I don't need security.

692
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,800
You will be surprised.

693
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,680
They are taking Uncle Bilaal
to the police station.

694
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,840
I will go with him.

695
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,280
God, have mercy.

696
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,520
Why will you go with him?

697
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,160
I will go with him.
- No, you stay here with the family.

698
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,640
I will keep you posted.

699
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,280
Oh, God!

700
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,560
One moment.

701
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,800
Who are you?

702
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,320
I am his lawyer.

703
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,280
Sir, will you tell us
who is the mastermind?

704
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,560
Three terrorists have been gunned down.

705
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,160
But we're still looking for the
mastermind behind the blasts.

706
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,840
We will get to him soon.

707
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,720
But, sir...
- That will be all. I'm out.

708
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
Sir, can you tell us how long will
it take to find him?

709
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,680
Send the dead body home
after the autopsy.

710
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,560
Drag the body all the way.

711
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,520
Let them know how the police operates.
- Okay, sir.

712
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,360
Oh, God!

713
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,600
Sir.

714
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,760
There are eight pieces. Two CPUs.

715
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,120
There's a lot of material too.

716
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,360
He's in for a long haul.
Thank you, sir.

717
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,680
Hurry up.

718
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,120
It must have reached.

719
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,560
Check the old man's CDR.

720
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,120
So many calls made to Pakistan.

721
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,760
None of it has any sugar.

722
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,960
Look here.

723
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,960
Answer me. Had you been there?

724
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,240
Did you teach him how to manufacture
bombs or did you send him for training?

725
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,760
Sir, I had no clue

726
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,680
that he was in the company
of such people.

727
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,640
Bilaal, stop pretending.

728
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,360
Bilaal...

729
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,680
Don't try to pun on an act.

730
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,120
Do you hear me?

731
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,680
I could've arrested your son
if I wished.

732
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,040
I shot him four times.

733
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,840
One shot in the head

734
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,800
and three in the chest.

735
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,000
Only then did he die.

736
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,080
The post-mortem is going on.

737
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,320
Allow us to go there.
We need to hear their conversation.

738
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,520
You cannot stop us.

739
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,600
This is not done. Allow us to go there.

740
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,840
Yes?

741
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,720
Give me the keys.

742
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,120
I will open it for you.
This is my shop.

743
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,360
Just give me the keys.
It will take us a lot of time.

744
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,040
I will open it for you.
This is my shop.

745
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,480
Consider yourself lucky that
this isn't your shop.

746
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,480
Give me the keys.

747
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,560
Thank you.

748
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,120
We'll call you.

749
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,480
Move back. Come on!

750
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,040
My name is Bilaal.

751
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,280
Shahid was a terrorist.

752
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,640
I am his father.

753
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,000
I don't know anything else.

754
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,560
My name is Bilaal.

755
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,920
Shahid was a terrorist.

756
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,280
I am his father.

757
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,600
I don't know anything else.

758
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,800
My name is Bilaal.

759
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,600
Just a minute, father.

760
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,560
Yes.
- Aarti...

761
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,080
How much more time will Bilaal take?

762
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,360
I think it will be long.

763
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,600
I will come there.
- No.

764
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,120
You don't need to.

765
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,040
I am sitting in the corridor.

766
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,920
You stay with the family.

767
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,840
I will keep calling you.

768
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,080
Aftab had called.

769
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,040
He wanted to come here,
but I told him not to.

770
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,560
We'll wait for a couple of days.

771
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,960
Okay.

772
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,400
Sir, please. Just two questions.

773
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,720
Father...
- No.

774
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,200
Father, are you okay?
- Please leave.

775
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,000
Hello! Father, are you okay?
- Sir, please.

776
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,600
Hello?
- Yes.

777
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,360
Yes, I am alright.

778
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,760
Shahid was a terrorist.

779
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,560
Keep saying it.

780
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,680
I am his father.

781
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,640
If you remember anything, say that too.

782
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,840
My name is Bilaal.

783
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,640
Shahid was a terrorist.

784
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,200
I am his father.

785
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,680
Greetings, sir.

786
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,000
We are organising all-night
prayers for the Goddess.

787
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,680
Park your car over there
for a few days.

788
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,440
Even you're invited.

789
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,800
Hey! Keep working.
- Okay.

790
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,120
'And this has resulted in some
hope that a lot will change.'

791
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,360
The demand for reservation.'

792
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,440
I watched TV all night and saw
this newspaper in the morning.

793
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,920
To be honest,

794
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,760
I can't believe it.

795
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,080
He had a terrorist at home

796
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,760
and he was not aware of it.

797
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,520
Muzzamil who lives in the neighbourhood
teaches my daughter maths.

798
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,920
What do I do now?

799
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,640
Should I take homeopathic
medicine from him or not?

800
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,520
Should I send my daughter
to Muzzamil for tuitions?

801
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,520
Didn't I tell you to turn the
speaker towards Badar Manzil?

802
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,360
Go and fix it.

803
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,920
Chaubey, what is your son up to?

804
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,200
No prayers were organised
in this temple till date.

805
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,720
If there haven't been prayers,
there had never

806
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,200
been a terrorist in the
neighbourhood either.

807
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,960
They should know

808
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,680
that the entire country will stand
together if needed.

809
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,320
Hello!

810
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,720
Yes, Murad Ali Mohammed speaking.

811
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,040
Yes.

812
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,240
I will be waiting.

813
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,360
Chhoti,

814
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,680
they are coming here

815
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,960
with Shahid's dead body.

816
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,000
You will have to sign
to receive the dead body.

817
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,560
Come with me.

818
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,600
No...

819
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,480
I don't want it.

820
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,640
His shouldn't be brought to this house.

821
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,880
I don't want him in this house.

822
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,400
Never!

823
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,720
Shahid is not welcome in this house.

824
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,840
Bury him, cremate him,
throw away his dead body.

825
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,440
Don't bring him to this house!

826
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,920
He is not my son.

827
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,200
Tabassum, let me go.

828
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,840
His dead body shouldn't
be brought to this house.

829
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,800
Tabassum, let me go.

830
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,960
Tell them not to bring his
corpse to this house.

831
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,320
Come with me.

832
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,160
"The most forgiving and merciful..."

833
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,640
Murad, don't bring his corpse
to this house.

834
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:18,960
"I am shattered completely.
Lend me Your support."

835
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:26,080
"There is darkness everywhere.
Let there be light."

836
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:33,080
"I am shattered completely.
Lend me Your support."

837
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:41,200
"There is darkness everywhere.
Let there be light."

838
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,440
Please sign here.

839
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,000
We don't want him.
- What?

840
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,720
He is not from our family.

841
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,760
Do whatever you want with him.

842
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,040
We don't want him.

843
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,640
"I'm not myself anymore."

844
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,360
"Smothered in a cloud of smoke."

845
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,080
"No sight of land or sky."

846
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,040
"Where am I?"

847
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,280
"Lead me to my destination,
Lord Almighty."

848
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,040
"Show me the way, Lord Almighty."

849
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,640
"Lead me to my destination,
Lord Almighty."

850
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:32,160
"Show me the way, Lord Almighty."

851
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,240
"Guide us on to the right path."

852
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,080
"The path of those who You have graced
and not of those who have angered You."

853
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,320
No, Aftab. It doesn't look good.

854
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,200
They have been questioning him
for the past 17 hours.

855
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,360
Yes. Sorry.

856
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:57,800
"Take my breath away, let me die."

857
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:04,720
"I've been away from home for long,
let me go home."

858
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:12,720
"How long should I think about You
and pray to You?"

859
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:20,600
"Come before me,
I want to question Thee."

860
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,040
"Am I wrong or is it the world?"

861
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,720
"Or are You wrong?"

862
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,520
"O Lord, answer me."

863
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:38,560
"I stand before Thee."

864
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,720
Can I meet him?
- We're arresting him.

865
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,760
We will conduct a medical test first
and produce him in court in two hours.

866
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,680
Talk to your lawyer if you wish.

867
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,920
I am his lawyer.
- Oh, really?

868
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,600
Uncle, don't worry.

869
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,560
I am with you, don't worry.

870
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,240
The FIR has been filed.

871
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,920
Have a look.

872
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,960
You have no choice but to defend him.

873
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,920
By the way, what's your name?

874
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,800
Aarti.

875
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,840
What's your full name?

876
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,800
Aarti Mohammed.

877
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,160
Doctor, she's sweating profusely,
she has turned cold too.

878
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,400
If you could please come immediately...

879
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,880
Yes, she's nervous.

880
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,520
Tell me which medicine...

881
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,240
Aayat, mix some sugar and salt
in a glass of water and bring it.

882
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,720
Please spell it.

883
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,840
Mix sugar and salt in a glass of
water and bring it for your mom.

884
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,440
Okay, thank you.

885
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,600
Where is she going?

886
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,960
Aayat!

887
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,960
Aayat!

888
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,360
No, father. There will be no press.

889
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,120
The police will get custody.

890
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,480
There's a special court, I will attend.

891
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,960
Okay, the card was
renewed the last time.

892
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,120
Step back.

893
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,480
Wait a minute.

894
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,680
Go on.

895
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,440
'State versus Bilaal Mohammed!'

896
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,640
I want his custody.

897
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,920
Your Honour,

898
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,160
the accused Bilaal Mohammed

899
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,280
is the father of one of the terrorists
involved in the Allahabad bomb blasts.

900
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,840
The police took him into custody and
have made preliminary enquiries.

901
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,720
But for a thorough investigation,

902
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,600
the court is requested

903
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,160
to grant 14 days police custody.

904
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,720
What do you have to say, ma'am?

905
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:24,080
My Lord, my client has already been
questioned non-stop for 17 hours.

906
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,400
His house was searched too,

907
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,520
and he will be available
for further questioning,

908
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,520
there is no need for the police
to retain custody.

909
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,640
I see.

910
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,720
Does the police not need it?

911
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,080
Your Honour, the evidence
can be tampered with.

912
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,560
There can be a threat to his life too.

913
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,520
The investigation will be hampered.

914
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,360
Mr Santosh Anand, you seem quite
concerned about the life of the accused.

915
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,520
Police custody granted.

916
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,360
Thank you.

917
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,280
Sir, my client has gone through
immense mental trauma.

918
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,640
I fear his life is at risk too.

919
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,960
Hence, I request that his medical report
be provided to me every 48 hours,

920
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,520
and as per the provisions
under section 41 D CRPC,

921
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,560
grant us permission to meet him
during the investigation. - Alright.

922
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,320
Are you new to this court?

923
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,640
I haven't seen you before.

924
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,280
Alright, granted.

925
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,880
'State versus Bundaram.'

926
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,360
Where is Rashid?
- What happened?

927
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,760
Wait! Listen!

928
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,200
Listen to me!

929
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,560
Listen!

930
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,160
Rashid!

931
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,960
Rashid, come downstairs!

932
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,640
Rashid!

933
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,080
You knew, didn't you?
- What?

934
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,960
You were aware, weren't you?

935
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,360
I didn't know about yesterday's plan.

936
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,200
Then what were you aware of?

937
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,960
Rashid, my brother Shahid died.

938
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,240
What happened?

939
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,120
Tell uncle what you did.

940
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,600
Shahid was unable to find
his cell phone that day.

941
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,040
When I found it near the television,
I went to his room to surprise him.

942
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,120
'Shahid, I found the phone.'

943
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,400
'Aayat.
- What's that?'

944
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,480
'We were just having fun.'

945
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,080
When I asked them, they told me
they were just watching it.

946
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,080
When I questioned Rashid today,
he got scared.

947
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,880
He didn't tell me anything.

948
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,240
I will go and ask Rashid.

949
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,200
Where is Rashid? I am...

950
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,120
Greetings.

951
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,880
Greetings.

952
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,480
I want to talk to Rashid.

953
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,560
I sent him to Dubai.

954
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,840
I mean, he is leaving tonight.

955
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,480
Bilaal is in deep trouble

956
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,200
and I somehow want to prove

957
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,960
that Bilaal has got nothing to do
with what Shahid did.

958
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,560
So...
- No.

959
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,600
Bilaal is your friend too.

960
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,080
So, what do I do?

961
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,520
What do you expect me to do?

962
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,400
Should I take the blame on me?

963
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,800
Should I get my son into trouble?

964
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,880
In fact, you should
not get us involved.

965
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,760
You have been disgraced.

966
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,280
We shouldn't...

967
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,280
The mistakes committed by Shahid,

968
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,720
that you might have overlooked.

969
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,840
Murad,

970
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,680
you've been pointing out

971
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,200
my mistakes all my life.

972
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,040
I failed to understand my mistakes.

973
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,440
When you didn't realise

974
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,080
that Shahid was making mistakes,
how could I?

975
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,680
I was assured as Shahid
was under your care.

976
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,240
It was better for him
not to learn anything from me.

977
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,960
If you have made any mistakes...

978
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,840
You're talking to me
after two long years.

979
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,280
I've always been wanting to
please you somehow

980
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,560
so that you start talking to me again.

981
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,240
I might have erred.

982
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,200
But it wasn't intentional.

983
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,560
It wasn't intentional.

984
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,960
Please get me released, Murad.

985
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,120
Get me out of here.

986
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,440
Please get me released.

987
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,400
Everything will be alright, uncle.

988
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,360
I hope you're not being tortured.
- No.

989
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,280
If they do, let us know.

990
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,800
Okay.

991
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,840
Bilaal!

992
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,240
I will have you discharged honourably.

993
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,880
Good day, Murad.
- Good day.

994
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,760
'There never used to be
so much traffic here.'

995
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,800
'There's a shrine ahead.'

996
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,120
'They must be celebrating.'

997
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,160
'Why are they doing
that on the street?'

998
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,120
'Uncle, they go to the shrine
to celebrate.'

999
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,560
'When the shrine was built,
there was space in the city,'

1000
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,800
'it wasn't densely populated.'

1001
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,360
'But it's different now.'

1002
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,720
'Customs should change with time.'

1003
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,680
'Customs never change, uncle.'

1004
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,560
'No community has stopped
celebrating on the streets.'

1005
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,280
I seem to have missed something.

1006
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,600
What is justice, counsellor?

1007
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,520
There was no judicial system
in the prehistoric times.

1008
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,760
Man would drink cow's milk.

1009
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,720
And a tiger would eat the cow.

1010
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,520
Nobody believed in the law.

1011
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,720
Neither man nor cow.

1012
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,400
It was only after society was formed,

1013
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,240
that there was talk of laws.

1014
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,200
And it was decided

1015
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,360
that those who obey
the law will be happy

1016
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,400
and those who don't will be unhappy.

1017
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,960
But is it possible all the time?
- No.

1018
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,480
At times, the one who obeys
the law will be unhappy.

1019
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,960
Isn't that true?

1020
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,520
That's great.

1021
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,440
Isn't it, Danish?

1022
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,280
Is truth more important or the law?

1023
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,160
I take your leave. We can continue
this conversation some other time.

1024
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,560
Good day.

1025
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,760
He talks a lot.

1026
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,640
He is Dr Shastrabudhe.

1027
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,400
He is quite useful.

1028
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,200
Well-connected politically.

1029
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,800
Has the media in his control.

1030
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,560
Nowadays, it's not just the arguments
in court that make an impact.

1031
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,320
What is debated on TV,

1032
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,960
what's published in the newspapers
and on social media.

1033
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,680
All of that has
a great impact on the case.

1034
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,440
I have summoned him for our case.

1035
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,080
He will manage everything.

1036
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,960
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1037
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,040
Two of the three terrorists
involved in the Allahabad blasts

1038
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,880
on 14th October were shot dead
by the police at a distance of

1039
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,680
around 100 kilometres
from the scene of their crime,

1040
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,360
and their leader,

1041
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,920
Shahid Mohammed was
cornered at one of his hideouts.

1042
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,440
At his other hideout in
Madanpura, Varanasi...

1043
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,040
Objection!

1044
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,520
Allow him to complete, Mr Ali.

1045
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,680
Your Honour, it's not a hideout,

1046
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,240
it's a house.

1047
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,000
You may call it a house.

1048
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,880
Allow me to call it a hideout.

1049
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,920
There's an ancestral house in Madanpura

1050
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,040
and the house belongs to a family.

1051
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,560
The activities happening there don't
usually happen in a house, Mr Ali.

1052
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,160
That's what he meant.

1053
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,560
Don't call it a hideout, Mr Anand.

1054
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,960
Call it a house.

1055
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,880
Alright.

1056
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:30,440
If you see the telephone records of
Bilaal Mohammed, you will come to know

1057
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,400
that in the past three months
he has received 300 calls

1058
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,080
from five numbers in Pakistan.

1059
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,640
Pakistan.

1060
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,520
300 calls from Pakistan,
Mr Ali Mohammed.

1061
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,640
Therefore, the accused Bilaal Mohammed

1062
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,280
should be charged under sections

1063
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,760
302, 120B and 124A
of Indian Penal Code 1860,

1064
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,920
section 9B of Explosive Act 1884,

1065
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,480
and section 16 of

1066
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:04,720
unlawful activities
prevention act 1967.

1067
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,800
That's all, Your Honour.

1068
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,360
Is Afzal at home?

1069
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,240
Tabassum Zohra.

1070
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,880
Wasn't that was your name
before marriage?

1071
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,200
Yes.

1072
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,160
How long have you known Mehfooz Alam?

1073
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,840
What?

1074
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,720
Since when do you know Mehfooz Alam?

1075
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,800
I don't know him.
- You don't?

1076
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,160
Does your mom not know Mehfooz Alam?

1077
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,960
Alright.

1078
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,400
You must have heard
your mom mention Mehfooz.

1079
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,440
Did you hear the name or not?

1080
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,760
Look at me and talk.

1081
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,640
No, I haven't.
- I will put both of you behind bars.

1082
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,040
When did you introduce
Mehfooz Alam to Shahid?

1083
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,440
When and how?

1084
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,960
They never met.

1085
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,800
Look, your son is dead.

1086
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,040
I'll make sure your husband
is not released for 10 to 20 years.

1087
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,200
Tell me everything you
know about Mehfooz,

1088
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,480
so that you and your daughter
can go home.

1089
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,960
When and how did Shahid meet Mehfooz?

1090
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,640
Look, we'll be able to help you
only if you help us,

1091
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,240
or else...

1092
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,920
Who will marry her?

1093
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,960
Think about the future.

1094
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,640
Think and let me know.

1095
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,520
Greetings, counsellor.

1096
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,280
Greetings.

1097
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,120
Things were different earlier.

1098
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,160
There was no television or internet.

1099
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,520
Nobody knew what was going on
in the world.

1100
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,720
But now, kids get to know everything.

1101
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,960
What do they get to know?

1102
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,760
They get to know the condition
of the Muslims in this world.

1103
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,200
The kids get to see everything.

1104
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,640
They get to hear everything.

1105
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:39,120
By the grace of God, they are eager
to fight for the Muslims.

1106
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,920
We should thank you and Shahid

1107
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,880
for doing what I was supposed to do.

1108
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,280
May God grant heaven to Shahid.

1109
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,800
We've heard a proverb since childhood,

1110
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,160
'The British left, but they left
their progeny behind.'

1111
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,000
The proverb has changed now.

1112
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,160
'The Moghuls left,
but they left Jihad behind.'

1113
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,880
Objection, My Lord!

1114
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,800
Mr Anand,

1115
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,360
refrain from making
religious comments in court.

1116
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,840
I won't allow it.

1117
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,560
It is not religious, My Lord.

1118
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,640
Terrorism has nothing to do
with religion.

1119
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,560
'My name is Khan,
and I am not a terrorist.'

1120
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,160
He said something like
that, doesn't he?

1121
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,240
Your Honour, this is not a case

1122
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,840
where a terrorist killed
innocent people

1123
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,640
and the court convicted him.

1124
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,080
Then, there's the next case.

1125
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,760
Candle marches are held.
How long will this continue?

1126
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,680
My Lord, I will take some more time
of the court.

1127
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:43,600
But this is an ideal case
to understand terrorism.

1128
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,480
Santosh Anand,
you always take more time.

1129
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,240
Go ahead, I'm listening.

1130
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,520
The situation that we're dealing with

1131
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,800
is the business of terrorism.

1132
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,160
There are lots of children
in their community.

1133
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,920
Objection, My Lord!

1134
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,680
Which community is he talking about?

1135
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,200
He's talking about your community.

1136
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,920
Mr Anand,

1137
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,160
you can't level allegations
against religion in court.

1138
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,680
This is my second warning.

1139
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,880
My Lord, it's not an allegation,
there's enough data.

1140
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,520
More than one marriage is allowed
in their community.

1141
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,440
It is obvious that they'll have
more children.

1142
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,240
More than one marriage is allowed

1143
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,040
to give birth to more children.

1144
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,120
They are crying.

1145
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,600
In their community,
the level of education

1146
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,360
is very low.

1147
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,240
Objection, My Lord!

1148
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,760
Why are you taking it personally?

1149
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,120
Let me finish.

1150
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,600
My Lord, I will produce some data
pertaining to that.

1151
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,240
When there are more children
and very few jobs,

1152
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:47,640
one of the family members
is sent on the path of Jihad.

1153
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,720
Giving them a chance
to serve their religion

1154
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,600
and also earn some money.

1155
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:57,520
My Lord, Bilaal Mohammed is
a member of such a family.

1156
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,400
To prove my point,

1157
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,120
I would like to present Bilaal
Mohammed before the court.

1158
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,280
Bilaal Mohammed,
present yourself in court.

1159
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,280
What's your name?

1160
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,360
Bilaal.
- What does it mean?

1161
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,200
Your Honour, Bilaal

1162
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,600
is the name of their ancestor
mentioned in the Quran

1163
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,720
who was the first to give the Azaan
in the history of Islam.

1164
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,400
Azaan is a call to prayer

1165
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,160
which is given five times a day

1166
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,480
through huge loudspeakers
in every city of our country.

1167
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,080
Objection, My Lord!

1168
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,080
Five times a day we are told

1169
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,680
that there is only one God

1170
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,520
and they are the ones who
worship Him, that is Allah!

1171
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,840
Objection, My Lord!

1172
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,640
He's merely stating a fact,
Mr Ali Mohammed.

1173
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:53,000
Isn't the call to prayer given five
times a day, through loudspeakers?

1174
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,920
Our Hindu Gods have no value.

1175
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,960
They aren't considered to be Gods.

1176
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,280
'There's no God but Allah...'

1177
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,720
Don't they say that in Arabic?

1178
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,400
Well, I know a bit of Arabic...
- Objection, My Lord!

1179
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,080
The public prosecutor will need
to learn a lot more Arabic

1180
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,240
to find out what the Quran says
about other religions.

1181
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,320
And he also needs to
learn some manners.

1182
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,680
This is not relevant to the case.

1183
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,680
This is the case, My Lord.

1184
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,720
This is not just about
Shahid and Bilaal.

1185
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,320
This is a case about a mentality

1186
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,840
that kills innocent people
in the name of religion

1187
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,480
and then they say,
'Every Muslim is not like that.'

1188
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,920
Well, then, who will tell us who is
and who isn't like that?

1189
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,480
Objection, My Lord!

1190
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,440
He's connecting crime to religion.

1191
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,720
Mr Ali Mohammed, he is arguing

1192
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,000
that this crime is
connected to religion.

1193
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,440
Please sit down. Yes.

1194
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:52,440
You teach the Quran to children
since childhood, right? - Yes.

1195
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,080
You must have taught it to Shahid too.

1196
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,680
We did try,

1197
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,200
but he showed little interest.

1198
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,520
If this is what he did
when he had little interest,

1199
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,920
what if he had developed
a keen interest?

1200
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,320
I object, Your Honour!

1201
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:12,360
This is blasphemous!

1202
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,440
Why don't you listen to him?

1203
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,600
You will get your chance.

1204
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,520
I am sorry, Your Honour.

1205
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,720
I am not insulting any religion.

1206
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,880
I respect Mr Ali Mohammed,

1207
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,680
he's like my elder brother.

1208
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:31,760
Your Honour, Hindu and Muslims
live together in this country.

1209
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:35,760
Every Muslim is welcomed
in this country

1210
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,840
and the society respects them

1211
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,120
because his Muslim community

1212
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,960
has given us gems like

1213
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,080
Abdul Hameed,
Abdul Kalam, Bismillah Khan,

1214
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,120
though it is exceptional.

1215
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,120
Your Honour, I would like to call
Bilaal Mohammed's daughter

1216
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,320
Aayat Mohammed to the witness box.

1217
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,600
Aayat Mohammed,
present yourself in court.

1218
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,960
Go, my child.

1219
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,560
Aayat,

1220
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:23,280
when you came to know that
your brother has been killed,

1221
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,280
how did you feel?

1222
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:33,680
Listen, dear, I know it is difficult
to answer such a question.

1223
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,960
But it is important.

1224
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:42,280
So, when you learnt that
your brother was killed,

1225
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,200
how did you feel?

1226
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,120
I felt bad.

1227
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,920
I felt bad.

1228
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,880
Why did you feel bad?

1229
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,960
I used to love him a lot.

1230
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,080
Exactly!

1231
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,560
Your Honour, the sister felt bad
that her brother got killed,

1232
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,280
but she didn't feel bad

1233
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,400
that her brother had killed
many innocent people.

1234
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,560
If he was alive,
everything would've been alright.

1235
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,400
Objection, My Lord!

1236
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,760
None of the allegations levelled against
the accused Bilaal has been proved.

1237
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,160
And his family members are

1238
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,880
being questioned
on the basis of religion.

1239
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,400
I am not raising these questions.

1240
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,160
These questions come to mind naturally.

1241
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,680
Your Honour, the accused
Bilaal and this family

1242
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,800
prepared the child for
martyrdom since childhood.

1243
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,240
They introduced him to terrorists

1244
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,200
and incited him against
India and Indians.

1245
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:39,560
They prepared him

1246
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:44,040
and provided him logistical support
to carry out the blasts.

1247
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,440
Your Honour, I'd like to request
the court to give me some time

1248
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,240
to prove

1249
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,120
that not just the accused,

1250
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:58,080
but his entire family is involved
in this terrorist conspiracy.

1251
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,520
Aayat, have one roti at least.

1252
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,080
Keep it.

1253
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,400
Mom!

1254
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,080
Mom!
- What happened?

1255
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,560
Mom...
- What happened?

1256
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,840
What happened?

1257
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,160
See this.

1258
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,640
What is it?

1259
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,720
What happened?

1260
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,760
Get them out here!

1261
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,360
Step out of the house!

1262
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,520
Go inside!

1263
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,280
Who is it?

1264
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,440
Murad!
- All of you, go inside.

1265
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,280
Go inside.
- Come with me.

1266
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,480
Go inside.

1267
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,800
For God sake, come inside.

1268
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,880
I am feeling scared.

1269
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,040
I am feeling scared.

1270
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,040
"I can't take my eyes off you."

1271
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,360
"Your beauty holds me spellbound."

1272
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,680
"You are the epitome of love."

1273
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,960
"I am the eternal spring."

1274
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,320
"You are the epitome of love."

1275
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,800
"I am the eternal spring."

1276
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,480
"We belong to each other"

1277
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,480
"that's all I know."

1278
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,880
"If I ever look at someone
other than you,"

1279
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,720
"may I go blind."

1280
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,520
"Even the pebbles on your street
seem incredible."

1281
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,080
"I yearn for..."

1282
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,840
'Go to Pakistan'

1283
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,400
It's good that no one was hurt.

1284
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,280
Get the wall painted quickly.

1285
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,440
It doesn't look good.

1286
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:30,040
I suggest you should not
register an FIR.

1287
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,320
It must be some hooligans.

1288
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,880
I'll find them and warn them.

1289
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,200
It's about the neighbourhood.

1290
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,920
If an FIR is registered,

1291
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,280
we will have to investigate the matter.

1292
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,200
Why do you want to upset them?

1293
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,680
You will need the help of the people
in your neighbourhood in this case.

1294
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,960
Won't they need me?

1295
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,560
You don't understand.

1296
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,120
The case against you is for terrorism.

1297
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,240
My case is related to terrorism.

1298
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,920
And what happened last night
was done by some hooligans?

1299
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,720
Well, they didn't kill anyone.

1300
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,280
What if they had killed someone?

1301
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,840
Five of us were sitting
in the courtyard.

1302
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,520
They threw 12-15 stones at us.

1303
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,440
If one or two of us
had lost their lives,

1304
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,400
would you believe that
they were terrorists?

1305
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,360
A lot of people died in Delhi in 1984.

1306
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,480
They weren't killed by Muslims.

1307
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,160
Wasn't that an act of terrorism?

1308
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,400
Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bengal,
Gujarat, Ayodhya, Kashmir...

1309
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,560
Who will decide which of these
were acts of terrorism?

1310
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,240
Who will decide that?

1311
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,560
And you speak of terrorism!

1312
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:32,000
An act of terrorism doesn't
necessitate killing someone.

1313
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,960
Trying to scare someone
is also an act of terrorism.

1314
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,400
Your Honour,

1315
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,440
I would like to call the accused
Bilaal Mohammed's elder brother

1316
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,480
advocate Ali Mohammed
to the witness box.

1317
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,080
That's unusual.

1318
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,680
I have the right to call him,
Your Honour.

1319
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:09,880
Mr Ali Mohammed,

1320
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,920
can you please tell the court

1321
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,120
where were you on the night
of 6th December 1992?

1322
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,560
Your Honour,

1323
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,080
on the night of 6th December 1992,

1324
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,400
he was at the house of Mir Qasim Asad,

1325
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,160
which is at a distance of
2 km from his house.

1326
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,400
'After the demolition of the mosque,'

1327
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,280
'it's now the turn of our homes'

1328
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:32,960
'and our very existence.'

1329
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,120
'Everything could be attacked.'

1330
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,800
'We are at war.'

1331
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,480
'Only those who are prepared
to wage war,'

1332
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,960
'should live in this city.'

1333
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,520
'We will be victorious, God willing.'

1334
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,920
"Raise the slogan,
Allah is the greatest!"

1335
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,640
"Raise the slogan,
Allah is the greatest!"

1336
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,840
"Raise the slogan,
Allah is the greatest!"

1337
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,200
And most of the rioters

1338
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,800
were those who were present
at that meeting.

1339
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,800
Murad is not at fault.

1340
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,200
I took him to the meeting.

1341
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,600
Silence!

1342
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,480
Your Honour,

1343
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,640
this is the copy of the FIR
which was registered that night.

1344
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,960
This family has a history
of communalism, sir.

1345
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,840
Murad has nothing to do with this case.

1346
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,920
Shahid is my son.

1347
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,640
I'm responsible for everything,
Your Honour.

1348
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,720
Defence, talk to him.

1349
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,280
Shahid is my son.

1350
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,280
He was my son.

1351
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,920
Murad can't be held responsible.

1352
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,640
I'm solely responsible for everything.

1353
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,480
Murad is not at fault.
Punish me any way you deem fit.

1354
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,360
Defence, you need to explain

1355
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,160
the charges that have been
filed against him

1356
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,880
and that he will face more charges.

1357
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,680
Take him away.

1358
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:41,160
Shahid was a terrorist.

1359
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,640
I'm his dad.

1360
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,200
I don't know anything more about him.

1361
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,480
My name is Bilaal.

1362
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,120
Shahid was a terrorist.

1363
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,040
I don't know anything else.

1364
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,840
He has received calls

1365
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,800
from the same Pakistani phone numbers

1366
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,120
that are under investigation.

1367
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,080
And the investigation has led
us to conclude

1368
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,960
that all the charges levied against
Bilaal Mohammed

1369
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,440
are applicable to Ali Mohammed too.

1370
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:09,360
Hence, the investigating officer has
named him as an accused in this case.

1371
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:16,920
Hence, for further investigation
and examination,

1372
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,120
I plead that Ali Mohammed be remanded
to police custody for 14 days.

1373
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,840
My Lord, this FIR has got nothing
to do with this case.

1374
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,200
Mr Ali Mohammed is a reputed
lawyer and citizen of this city.

1375
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,840
He has been living in that house
all his life.

1376
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,880
He will always be available
for examination.

1377
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,120
The prosecution has no basis
for his custody, sir.

1378
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,520
He is available for examination, right?

1379
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,680
Press the charges first.
We'll talk about the custody later.

1380
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,240
Fair enough, Your Honour.

1381
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,840
Thank you.

1382
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,800
Father.
- Yes.

1383
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,120
Are you okay?

1384
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,960
Yes...

1385
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,760
It's just that I am unable to sleep.

1386
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,000
I was just thinking...

1387
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,480
When Tabassum came to this house
after we got married,

1388
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,040
she would fight with me quite often.

1389
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,520
She would complain
that I don't love her.

1390
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,800
I would say that I did.

1391
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,480
A lot.

1392
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,320
And she would say, 'Prove it.'

1393
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,640
How do you prove your love for someone?

1394
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,480
By showering your love, right?

1395
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,160
Today, I was asked in court

1396
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,960
to prove my love for my country.

1397
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,440
How do I go about it?

1398
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,800
How do I prove my love?

1399
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,120
Aarti...

1400
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,400
I want you to fight this case for me.

1401
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:17,320
I want you to prove my love
for my country.

1402
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,760
Or else I'll lose the
argument in court.

1403
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,560
I stand to lose.

1404
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,480
We won't lose the argument, father.

1405
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,360
'After filing charges against
the father of Shahid,'

1406
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,960
'the terrorist responsible for
the blasts in Allahabad,'

1407
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,040
'the prosecution has also
named Bilaal's elder brother'

1408
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,240
'Ali Mohammed as an accused
in this case.'

1409
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,480
Look, Aarti, you got married into
that family, we didn't object.

1410
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,720
But now...

1411
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,080
Now what, mom?

1412
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:55,680
Even the court has said that they
participated in the riots.

1413
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,000
The court didn't say that, mom.
The prosecutor said that.

1414
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,520
Turn on the TV.
Everyone is against them.

1415
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,400
Listen to me.

1416
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,960
Come back to us.

1417
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,960
You can go back
after the case concludes.

1418
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,520
We don't want any trouble.

1419
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,360
It's about terrorism, Aarti.

1420
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,600
Besides, you are a woman and...

1421
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,960
And you are unable to say
that I'm not a Muslim.

1422
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,240
I'm the daughter-in-law
of this family, mom.

1423
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,440
And father has given me the
responsibility of handling this

1424
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,520
without considering my gender

1425
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,320
or my religion.

1426
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,120
Aarti, please try to understand.

1427
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,840
It's time for the hearing, mom.

1428
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,080
I have to go.

1429
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,880
Just a minute.

1430
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,800
Yes, Mr Yadav. Tell us.

1431
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,960
Sir, during the course
of the investigation,

1432
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,480
I searched the accused
Bilaal Mohammed's house.

1433
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:05,560
A lot of material related to
the training of terrorists

1434
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,400
was recovered from the computer
at his house.

1435
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,440
And an electronic workshop was set up
in one of the bedrooms in the house

1436
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,200
from which a small mobile network
has been operated.

1437
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,840
What do you mean by
a small mobile network?

1438
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,520
You can call it
a private mobile network.

1439
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,800
It doesn't touch
any Indian mobile network.

1440
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,920
And we cannot tap the network.

1441
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,160
Your Honour, this is the antenna

1442
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,480
that was used to operate
the private mobile network,

1443
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,640
and it was installed on the rooftop
of the hideout.

1444
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,920
Objection, My Lord, that is a house.

1445
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Accept the facts
now at least, counsellor.

1446
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,120
Mr Anand, if you have the facts,
just present them.

1447
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,440
Why do you insist on saying
something that they don't like?

1448
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,280
I'm sorry.

1449
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,600
Your witness, Mohammed Aarti.

1450
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,840
Sorry.

1451
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,480
Aarti Mohammed.

1452
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,440
Mr Yadav, if I may ask,

1453
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,200
what are your qualifications?

1454
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,840
Sir, I have a Masters in
Computer Applications,

1455
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,200
besides which I have...
- So, if an expert like you

1456
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,600
had not been present
during the investigation,

1457
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,840
these things wouldn't
have been discovered, right?

1458
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,160
Yes. If you don't have
knowledge about computers...

1459
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,760
I would like to once again
show the court Bilaal's phone

1460
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,600
which the public prosecutor
has placed as an exhibit.

1461
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,320
This is not even a smartphone.

1462
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,280
In fact, Bilaal Mohammed is
a high school pass out.

1463
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,920
And it's almost impossible
for him to know

1464
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,560
what Shahid was doing on his computer.

1465
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,960
That's all, My Lord.

1466
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,520
Well...

1467
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,760
This proves beyond any doubt,
Your Honour

1468
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,600
that the level of education
in their community is very low.

1469
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:49,120
This antenna was installed
at the hideout...

1470
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,560
I'm sorry.

1471
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,440
On the roof of the house.

1472
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,360
They used to hang out
clothes to dry over there.

1473
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,200
Did none of the family
members see this?

1474
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,440
Or did all of them think

1475
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,160
that this a new machine
to attract pigeons?

1476
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:04,960
Your Honour!

1477
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,720
I would like to call
Bilaal Mohammed's helper

1478
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,040
Afzal Sabir to the witness box.

1479
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,080
You may go.

1480
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,320
Go ahead.

1481
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,680
Yes, Afzal.

1482
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,560
How long have you
been working for Bilaal?

1483
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,320
It's been a year and a half.
- Okay.

1484
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,560
This month 14 SIM cards
were released from your shop

1485
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,360
without verification of the documents.

1486
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,440
Is that true?

1487
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,120
Yes.
- On whose instructions?

1488
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,560
Please tell the court.

1489
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:37,280
The 14 SIM cards were delivered
without any documents,

1490
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,800
and Bilaal had asked me

1491
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:44,600
to arrange for the documents
from somewhere. - Right.

1492
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,160
Your Honour,

1493
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,760
the 14 SIM cards were given
to Mehfooz Alam.

1494
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,960
Out of which 4 SIM cards were used
during the Allahabad blasts.

1495
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,800
Point to be noted. That's all.

1496
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,720
Cross.

1497
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,560
Afzal, where did you work before
you started working for Bilaal?

1498
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,440
I used to work

1499
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,880
at Mr Patel's mobile shop in Lahartara.

1500
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,600
And before that?

1501
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,080
At Mishra Electronics.

1502
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,840
While you were working there,
did it ever happen that SIM cards

1503
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,440
were handed over to someone
without proper documents?

1504
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:23,600
Friends or relatives were
given cards sometimes

1505
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,080
I'm sorry to interrupt, Your Honour,

1506
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:30,640
but Mr Patel and Mr Mishra
don't promote jihad!

1507
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,880
Mr Anand, that's a different argument.

1508
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,400
It doesn't have to do anything
with this case.

1509
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,920
Afzal, did Bilaal Mohammed tell you

1510
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,240
to give SIM cards to someone
without any documents?

1511
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,120
No, sir.

1512
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,640
Did Shahid tell you to do that?

1513
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,520
No.

1514
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:51,560
Which means Bilaal could have
taken those SIM cards

1515
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,640
or Shahid might have taken them,

1516
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,080
or you could have taken them.

1517
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,200
Objection, Your Honour.

1518
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,960
The defence is trying
to browbeat the witness.

1519
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,560
Not at all, My Lord.

1520
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,920
It is a possibility which the public
prosecutor might have missed.

1521
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,760
I'm just presenting it in court.

1522
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,520
Hence, it can't be conclusively proved

1523
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,880
that the 14 SIM cards were
given to someone

1524
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,960
with Bilaal Mohammed's knowledge
or following his instructions.

1525
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,840
That's all, My Lord.

1526
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,160
Greetings, sir.

1527
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,440
Greetings to you too.
- We are holding a meeting for Bilaal.

1528
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,680
What meeting?

1529
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,360
For the martyrdom of Shahid...

1530
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,680
Martyrdom!

1531
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,080
Was he martyred?

1532
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,480
Sir, they are defaming our community.

1533
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:07,360
Check out the social media
platforms and Facebook.

1534
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,640
If we don't stand united now,

1535
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,800
it will be impossible for us to
live in this country.

1536
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,520
Which country do you live in?

1537
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,040
I have the support of my country.

1538
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,640
The law is doing its job,

1539
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:20,920
and I'm doing mine.

1540
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:24,760
Of course.

1541
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:27,200
I have seen the wall of your house.

1542
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,360
They have called you a Pakistani.

1543
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,720
They are bound to write
that on my wall.

1544
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,720
That's because some families
celebrate when Pakistan wins.

1545
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,400
Also,

1546
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,960
what Shahid did is termed martyrdom.

1547
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,920
And what some thugs did to my house
is called patriotism!

1548
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:49,440
Yes. I accept that there are
some thugs in our neighbourhood.

1549
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,120
Just the way we had
someone like Shahid.

1550
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,360
The only difference is that
you are looking for the thugs,

1551
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,760
and I'm looking for Shahid.

1552
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,880
Do you know this man?

1553
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,200
No, sir.

1554
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,920
I don't know him, sir.

1555
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,960
You and Shahid have met him.

1556
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,880
You took Mehfooz Alam
to the railway station.

1557
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:23,520
Your Honour,

1558
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,960
Hari Om Jewellers is a shop right
opposite his shop.

1559
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:30,920
I want to show you the CCTV
footage of that shop.

1560
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:48,960
Exactly ten days before
the Allahabad blasts,

1561
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:52,520
this terrorist named Mehfooz Alam

1562
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:54,560
had visited his shop, Your Honour.

1563
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,640
What was the amount at which
the deal was finalised?

1564
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,960
He came to the shop with Shahid.

1565
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,440
I... I didn't even know him.

1566
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,280
That wasn't your shop.

1567
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,280
It was your third hideout

1568
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,920
where you provided
SIM cards to the terrorists

1569
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,640
and finalised a deal.

1570
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,200
What was the price you
got for your son?

1571
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,520
Objection, My Lord! None of
the charges has been proved yet.

1572
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,680
Mr Anand, do you have any evidence
that the deal happened?

1573
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,560
Well then, I will prove that too,
Your Honour.

1574
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,000
I would like to call the manager
of Ameer Nishan Hotel,

1575
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:28,040
Abdul Latif to the witness box.

1576
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,920
'Abdul Latif,
present yourself in court!'

1577
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,400
Please tell the court your occupation.

1578
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:44,480
I own Ameer Nishan Hotel in Dalmandi.

1579
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:46,280
Do you know Bilaal Mohammed?

1580
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,160
I don't know him personally,

1581
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,760
but a few days ago someone
from Pakistan...

1582
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:52,840
From where?

1583
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,120
A guest had arrived from Pakistan.
- Okay.

1584
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,360
He left

1585
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:01,120
$1500 cash for Mr Bilaal Mohammed.

1586
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,760
Did you give the $ 1500
to Bilaal Mohammed?

1587
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,120
Yes, sir.
- When?

1588
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,440
On 14th October at...
- At what time?

1589
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,200
Around 12 o'clock.

1590
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,640
Around 12 o'clock on 14th October,

1591
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,840
that is exactly four hours
after the blasts,

1592
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:25,000
Bilaal Mohammed gets the money
that came from Pakistan.

1593
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,880
And ten days before the blasts,

1594
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,920
this terrorist named Mehfooz Alam

1595
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:33,280
finalises a deal with Shahid
and Bilaal at their third hideout.

1596
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,360
And for a mere 100,000 rupees

1597
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:39,160
16 innocent Indians are killed.

1598
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,880
That's all, Your Honour.

1599
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:51,600
Uncle, who receives money
from Pakistan these days?

1600
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,080
You are a Muslim.

1601
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,760
If I do it, the Intelligence
Department won't spare me.

1602
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,640
That's not true.

1603
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,640
People are doing
business with Pakistan.

1604
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:07,560
And I received the
money from my sister.

1605
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,120
Neither of us can prove that
Aunt Roohi had sent the money.

1606
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,840
The mode of transfer was not legal.
Do you understand that?

1607
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,920
What could I do?

1608
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,600
The doctor said that surgery
was necessary.

1609
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,400
I could never do anything for Aayat.

1610
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:36,680
I cannot always ask Murad, can I?

1611
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,840
You are like a daughter to me.

1612
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,560
I can ask you.

1613
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:46,640
Listen, Aarti.

1614
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,600
They won't spare me.

1615
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,760
But I beg you.
- No.

1616
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:57,080
Please get Murad out of this mess.

1617
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,920
Get him out.

1618
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,440
It's 12:30, ma'am.

1619
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,440
A glass of water?

1620
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,160
What do you think?

1621
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,040
Will you win the case?

1622
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,560
What do you think?

1623
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:05,120
I will bring forth the truth in court.

1624
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,520
It's up to the court to do justice.

1625
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:15,880
"Hail the Goddess."

1626
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:17,880
"Answer the prayers"

1627
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:20,880
"of the devotees who flock to You."

1628
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:26,360
"We sit at your feet..."

1629
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,920
"Get rid of all our sorrow."

1630
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:38,640
"Your face..."

1631
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:40,800
"It gives us great pleasure"

1632
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,280
"to see You in all Your splendour."

1633
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,000
"Pay heed to everyone's prayers."

1634
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,480
"Please help me attain my objective."

1635
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,960
Let us through.

1636
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,880
"Your name..."

1637
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,600
"To see You in all Your splendour."

1638
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,800
"It gives us great pleasure"

1639
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,600
"to see You in all Your splendour."

1640
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,440
Are you done fighting the case?

1641
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,720
All of you are coming with me.

1642
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,040
No one will stay here.

1643
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,560
Where do you not want us to stay?

1644
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,680
No one will stay back in India.
- Why?

1645
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,160
Why should we stay here?

1646
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,960
We have no one here.

1647
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,440
We thought they are family.

1648
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,120
But did they?

1649
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,880
A few days back, everyone was
here in this veranda,

1650
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,720
having a feast.

1651
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,240
And Bilaal's corpse was laid
at this very place today.

1652
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,640
Did any of them come here?

1653
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,360
Why should we stay here?

1654
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,040
How can you say that?

1655
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,560
It wasn't Shahid's funeral.

1656
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,440
Aunt refused to accept his corpse.

1657
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,160
Isn't that enough?

1658
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,800
Aftab is right, Ali.

1659
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,760
There's a young girl in this house.

1660
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,440
Uncle's case is over, dad.

1661
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,400
They have no case against you.

1662
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,840
The trial will go on for years.

1663
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,400
Let's leave this place.

1664
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,200
Why should I leave?

1665
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:23,400
Where do I go?

1666
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,960
This is my home.

1667
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:29,240
Why will we let the trial
go on for years?

1668
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,760
What will I say to myself?

1669
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,960
Am I a traitor?

1670
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,360
Was Bilaal a criminal?

1671
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,600
Is Aayat a terrorist?

1672
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,640
How will Sonkar face the
people in this neighbourhood?

1673
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,520
Will he say that he
was supporting terrorists?

1674
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:46,720
We'll fight the case right here.

1675
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:47,840
We'll fight till the end.

1676
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,560
And we will let everyone see the fight.

1677
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,200
Aarti, talk to him.

1678
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,800
He's absolutely right.

1679
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,720
No one likes to leave his house.

1680
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:02,640
What if we lose the case?

1681
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:08,280
We'll speak the truth, Aftab.

1682
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:17,960
Sir, it so happened

1683
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,920
that we received a message on our
WhatsApp group around two years ago.

1684
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:26,040
It was to help the people of Kashmir
who were ravaged by floods.

1685
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:30,080
Shahid and I gathered around
7,000 rupees

1686
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:32,800
from our friends and acquaintances.

1687
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,040
We gave the money to Alam.

1688
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:48,280
'Thank you.
- You are welcome.'

1689
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,800
'What's your name?'

1690
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,200
'My name is Rashid.'

1691
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:52,880
'And I'm Shahid.'

1692
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,680
Alam told us that he's from Mumbai.

1693
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,160
And that he's an engineer.

1694
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,760
A few months later, he felt

1695
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,640
that the poor and deprived Muslims
of this country needs him.

1696
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,600
So, he quit everything else
and started helping the needy.

1697
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:17,040
What next?

1698
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,960
After that, he called us a few times...

1699
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,120
He called us directly a couple of times

1700
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,920
and asked us to collect donations.

1701
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,120
And we did it.

1702
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,000
Twice he told us to deliver
the money to someone else.

1703
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,360
And once, he'd come
to Varanasi personally.

1704
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:35,280
He met us and took the money.

1705
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,080
When did you meet him last?

1706
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:40,520
Around four months ago.

1707
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,960
'I'm tired of all this.'

1708
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,680
'I don't get support from the people.'

1709
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,680
'I don't get support from
the government.'

1710
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,160
'They trouble me instead.'

1711
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:52,520
'Why do they trouble you?'

1712
01:39:58,120 --> 01:40:00,400
'When I try to help the Muslims
in Kashmir,'

1713
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,040
'they say that I'm a Pakistani.'

1714
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,560
'They tap my phone,'

1715
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:07,960
'and call me to the police station.'

1716
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,840
'They trouble all those I speak to
over the phone.'

1717
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,240
'No...'

1718
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:18,920
'Henceforth, I won't call you.'

1719
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:24,400
'Or else they'll start
troubling you too.'

1720
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,480
'Why don't you use
the internet to make calls?'

1721
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,440
'Are you crazy?
- What?'

1722
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,920
'We have no idea who is and
what he wants.'

1723
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,560
'I hope you know what the
situation is these days.'

1724
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,440
'Alam is trying to do
something good here.'

1725
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:45,240
'He rightly says that the condition
of the Muslims is pathetic.'

1726
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:46,520
'Did I get a job?'

1727
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,600
'Did you get a job?'

1728
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,200
'Did Ashish get a job?'

1729
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,080
'What about Rakesh?'

1730
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,440
'We didn't even score that well.'

1731
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,680
'Let me make this clear.'

1732
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,920
'I don't want to receive any calls
or messages from that man.'

1733
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,800
'And you won't speak to him either.'

1734
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:00,680
'You won't talk to him!'

1735
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:03,880
And I decided

1736
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,040
not to meet him ever again.

1737
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:14,680
My Lord,

1738
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:17,920
here is Rashid's phone,

1739
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:21,000
and it has the WhatsApp group
which he just mentioned.

1740
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,040
That's all, My Lord.

1741
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,920
Do you have any questions, Mr Anand?

1742
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,720
Thank you, Your Honour.

1743
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:42,880
Rashid,

1744
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,160
did you inform anybody
about your meeting, my boy?

1745
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:49,840
No, I didn't tell anyone
about the meeting.

1746
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:50,800
What?

1747
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:53,240
I didn't inform anyone
about the meeting.

1748
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,840
Did you ever ask Shahid

1749
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,800
if he had met Mehfooz Alam?

1750
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,720
I had told him not to.

1751
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,920
We never spoke about it after that day.

1752
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,560
Your Honour,

1753
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:09,760
it's that simple.

1754
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:11,880
Rashid felt that it was
a mere coincidence

1755
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,160
that they met a terrorist.

1756
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,440
So, Rashid told Shahid,

1757
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,760
'Do whatever you want, I'm not
interested in terrorism.'

1758
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,000
That's all.

1759
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:24,800
He didn't find the need to speak
to anyone from his family about it.

1760
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,840
Your Honour,

1761
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:31,280
for this family terrorism
is a profession.

1762
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:33,880
Some people take it up, others don't.

1763
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:35,520
How would we know

1764
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,600
which terrorists Rashid continues
to be in contact with,

1765
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,080
as he refuses to divulge any
information about them.

1766
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,360
Or will he speak up

1767
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:47,080
when several innocent Indians
will be slaughtered?

1768
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,920
That's all, Your Honour.

1769
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,600
You may leave.

1770
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:53,600
Defence.

1771
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,200
My Lord,

1772
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,520
I would like to cross-examine
Afzal Sabir,

1773
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:03,120
and I'd like to show the footage of
Bilaal's shop to the court once again.

1774
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:06,040
'Afzal Sabir,
present yourself in court.'

1775
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:18,680
Can you please stop there?

1776
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,360
Afzal, what were you doing
standing on a chair?

1777
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:26,320
Sir, the account files are kept
on the top shelf in the cupboard.

1778
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,760
Bilaal had told me to retrieve
a file of a particular year.

1779
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,920
When did Bilaal tell you
to retrieve the file?

1780
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,120
He had just arrived at the shop

1781
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,960
and asked me to get
the file immediately.

1782
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:36,480
He had just arrived. Okay.

1783
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,360
Had he come in late that day?

1784
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,640
No. He had a meeting at the bank.

1785
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,200
But he had forgotten the file,
and he came back to get it.

1786
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,360
So... When he reached the shop,

1787
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:49,680
was someone already present there?

1788
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,840
Shahid and Alam were present
at the shop.

1789
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:56,920
Did Bilal know that Alam
was going to be there that morning?

1790
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,080
No, sir.

1791
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:01,320
He wasn't even aware
that Shahid was there too.

1792
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,320
Had you seen Mehfooz Alam before?

1793
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:06,720
No, sir.

1794
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:09,280
Shahid introduced me to Alam that day.

1795
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,440
He told me that Alam
is his friend's elder brother.

1796
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,920
My Lord, Bilal Mohammed

1797
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:17,760
had a meeting at ICICI bank,
regarding a loan.

1798
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:18,960
He'd forgotten to carry a file,

1799
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:20,640
and he returned to the shop
to retrieve it.

1800
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:21,880
And when he reached the shop,

1801
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:25,160
Shahid and Mehfooz Alam
were already present there.

1802
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,200
So, that was the first time

1803
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:30,000
when Bilal Mohammed met Mehfooz Alam.

1804
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,120
Yes, Your Honour.

1805
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:34,000
And he didn't like riding
the scooter all by himself.

1806
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:37,240
And he said, 'It doesn't matter
if you're a terrorist.'

1807
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:38,720
'Let's go for a drive!'

1808
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:44,120
My Lord, there's a railway station
right next to the ICICI bank.

1809
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:46,520
So, out of courtesy,
Bilal Mohammed offered

1810
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:49,640
to drop Mehfooz Alam to
the railway station.

1811
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:52,960
He was unaware
that he was aiding a terrorist.

1812
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:55,120
Such an abstract story, Your Honour.

1813
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:57,120
Of the highest order...

1814
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:00,000
The prosecution still believes

1815
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:03,040
that a deal had been finalised
between Bilal Mohammed, Shahid,

1816
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,440
and Mehfooz Alam.

1817
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,080
You may leave.

1818
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,360
My Lord,

1819
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:15,040
I would now like to cross-examine
Ajit Yadav, the nodal officer.

1820
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:17,600
Go ahead.

1821
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:24,560
Mr Ajit Yadav,

1822
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,240
do you think anyone could tell

1823
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,680
that this is a machine
for shooting pigeons?

1824
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,840
I think I wasn't clear enough.

1825
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:36,840
Do you think anyone could tell

1826
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:39,200
that this is a machine for
shooting pigeons?

1827
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,120
I don't think so, ma'am.

1828
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,480
It isn't meant for that.

1829
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,760
What's the probability

1830
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:46,080
that someone would figure out
what it really is?

1831
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,640
It isn't possible to say
anything in the first look.

1832
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,440
A tech-savvy boy from
their family said,

1833
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:52,720
'This is a signal booster for
the dish antenna.'

1834
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,920
And the family agreed to him.

1835
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:56,200
That's it, sir.

1836
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,600
Your Honour,

1837
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:00,040
It's not necessary that Bilal Mohammed

1838
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,760
or Ali Mohammed knew about this antenna.

1839
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:04,560
The prosecution believes

1840
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,080
that they both knew it very well.

1841
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:08,280
They knew what Shahid was up to.

1842
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:11,040
And also the amount of money
that he was going to get for it.

1843
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,320
Such an abstract imagination, My Lord.

1844
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:16,960
Presumption.

1845
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:19,680
Each argument by the public prosecutor

1846
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,480
is based on the abstract imagination.

1847
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:23,520
They think they know that the family
is full of terrorists,

1848
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,640
and everyone is a part of the plan.

1849
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:29,520
But they haven't provided
any strong evidence to prove it.

1850
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:30,800
That's all, My Lord.

1851
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,040
You may leave.

1852
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,440
My Lord,

1853
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:40,800
I'd like to summon the accused
Advocate Ali Mohammed

1854
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,800
to the witness box.

1855
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:46,040
'What's going on?'

1856
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:48,840
Mr Ali Mohammed, do you drive a car?

1857
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,520
Yes.

1858
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,400
How many traffic tickets do you have?

1859
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,320
None.

1860
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,360
Do you file income tax returns?

1861
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:57,640
Yes.

1862
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,720
Do you vote?
- Yes.

1863
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:01,920
Do you give bribes?
- What?

1864
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,760
Do you bribe government officials

1865
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:06,040
to get your work done smoothly?

1866
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,920
No. I don't.

1867
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,120
How many terrorists
do you have in your family?

1868
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:12,160
None.

1869
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:14,040
How can you be so sure?

1870
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:17,040
Because I know my family very well.

1871
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:18,760
Didn't you know Shahid, very well?

1872
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,520
Shahid... We made a mistake.

1873
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:24,200
What about Bilal?

1874
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,040
Bilal hasn't done anything.

1875
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,160
It hasn't been proved to the court yet.

1876
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:30,720
The charges levied on him
haven't been annulled.

1877
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:31,760
Anyway...

1878
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,200
Your son, Aftab Mohammed,
what about him?

1879
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,560
He has a business in London.

1880
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,960
Can you be dead sure
that he isn't a terrorist?

1881
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,280
No, he isn't a terrorist.

1882
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:44,080
Are you saying
this with the same belief,

1883
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:45,880
which made you think that
Shahid was innocent?

1884
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:49,400
I don't have any reason to doubt him.

1885
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,320
You might not have a reason,
Mr Ali Mohammed.

1886
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,400
But the prosecution believes

1887
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:56,440
that you and your family
breed terrorists

1888
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,160
and that's your source of income.

1889
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:01,640
You all are accused of being traitors.

1890
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:03,320
You and your entire family.

1891
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:06,680
We... We aren't traitors.

1892
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:08,680
How would you prove that?

1893
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:13,000
How do we accept
that you aren't a traitor?

1894
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:16,480
Just because when you had a choice
in the year 1947,

1895
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,360
to go to a Muslim state, you didn't?

1896
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:21,160
Or because

1897
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:23,400
you pay income tax, cast votes,

1898
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:24,920
and don't bribe government officials?

1899
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,040
You don't have any proof,
Mr Ali Mohammed,

1900
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:29,720
to state that you aren't a traitor.

1901
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:31,280
And we require proof.

1902
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:35,520
We require proof because
your look doesn't reflect patriotism.

1903
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,600
For how long do you have this beard?

1904
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,920
It's been around three years.
- Why?

1905
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:45,080
Religious custom.

1906
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:46,760
Have you ever thought about this?

1907
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:50,440
How would a patriot differentiate
between the bearded Ali Mohammed,

1908
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,200
and those bearded terrorists

1909
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:55,240
from Syria, Afghanistan,
Pakistan and Kashmir,

1910
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,680
whose photographs are printed in
newspapers every other day?

1911
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,360
How would we know
that they are the bad Muslims,

1912
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,280
and you're the good one?

1913
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:09,560
Mr Ali Mohammed, your nephew
stayed with you in that house,

1914
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:13,440
and he has killed 16 people
in collaboration with terrorists.

1915
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:15,520
Your brother Bilal Mohammed,

1916
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:18,040
has been accused
of being a part of this conspiracy.

1917
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:20,800
You've been accused
of being a part of this conspiracy.

1918
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,080
How would you prove
that you're a good Muslim?

1919
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:26,160
Tell us...

1920
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:34,640
How will you prove
that you're a good Muslim?

1921
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:39,920
When I'd read the Quran,

1922
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:45,040
I knew that Allah would ask me
this question on the judgement day.

1923
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,040
Whether I was a good Muslim

1924
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,600
or not.

1925
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:52,680
And He will decide.

1926
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,600
He will decide.

1927
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:59,640
I tried my best to be a good Muslim,

1928
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:02,800
but I made some mistakes.

1929
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:08,080
Mr Santosh Anand spoke about
the meeting in the year 1992,

1930
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:13,200
and I have been accused
of disturbing communal harmony.

1931
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:14,800
'They'll set our house on fire.'

1932
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:16,800
'Look outside.
People are killing everyone.'

1933
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:18,680
'This is my house.
I won't leave this house.'

1934
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:21,080
'We will have to leave.
Hurry up, Bilal.'

1935
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:22,040
'I won't leave.'

1936
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:24,520
'That was the night
of 6th December 1992.'

1937
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,400
'We were very scared on that night.'

1938
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,640
'Every Muslim was scared.'

1939
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,160
'And some people came to my house.'

1940
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,600
'Sonkar. Chaubey.'

1941
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:37,680
'The situation is getting worse.'

1942
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,880
'But you don't worry.
Both of us will stay here.'

1943
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:43,000
'We won't let any harm come on you.'

1944
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:46,000
I wish Chaubey and Sonkar

1945
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:47,680
went to every Muslim.

1946
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:51,360
I'm sorry to take your time,

1947
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:54,160
but it's necessary to know those people

1948
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:56,720
who are accused of being terrorists.

1949
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:58,360
My lord,

1950
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:00,960
whatever happened in this life,

1951
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,680
it is because of this country.

1952
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:05,040
Abdul Hamid fought for the country

1953
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,560
so did Gandhi,

1954
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,560
and Mother Teresa.

1955
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,480
In this country, I also
benefited from being a Muslim,

1956
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,560
and at times,
I was under suspicion too,

1957
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:18,120
but I will be buried
in the very same cemetery

1958
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:21,160
which is 200 meters away from my home.

1959
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,360
The public prosecutor said

1960
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:25,680
that he respects the Muslims

1961
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:27,560
and welcomes them.

1962
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:32,240
Who gave him the right to
welcome me in my own house?

1963
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:36,360
This country belongs
to you and me too.

1964
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,960
If you think I am unfaithful,

1965
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,840
go and find out why it is so.

1966
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:44,160
If you don't know how to differentiate

1967
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:46,120
between Shahid and Murad Ali,

1968
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,840
then find out why it is so.

1969
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,400
And if you're unable to differentiate

1970
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,880
between my beard and
Osama Bin Laden's beard,

1971
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,720
I still have the right
to follow my religion.

1972
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,560
If you are good to me,

1973
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:05,840
I will lay down my life for you.

1974
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,120
But if you point finger at me,

1975
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:12,360
then remember,
I am not answerable to you,

1976
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:15,440
I'm answerable to my community
and my country.

1977
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,920
That's all, my lord.

1978
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,920
You may go.

1979
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:33,040
My lord, I now want to examine

1980
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:35,360
the investigating officer
Danish Javed.

1981
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:38,160
Danish Javed, present
yourself in court.

1982
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,360
As per the phone call records
of the accused Bilaal Mohammed

1983
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:49,720
submitted by the prosecution,
about 300 calls are from Pakistan.

1984
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:53,960
Can you tell us from which terrorist
organisation these calls were made?

1985
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:55,320
We don't know yet,

1986
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,880
but we've sent a request
to the Government of Pakistan and

1987
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:59,320
our own intelligence.

1988
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,320
Are these numbers on the alert list
of any Indian agency?

1989
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:04,920
No, but that doesn't mean...

1990
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:05,960
Of course, not.

1991
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,560
It doesn't mean that these numbers
cannot be under suspicion.

1992
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:13,120
My lord, these 300 phone calls
were made from five numbers.

1993
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:16,240
Here's the report
from Telenor, Pakistan.

1994
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:20,080
The first number belongs
to his cousin Dr Pervez Ahmed.

1995
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:23,440
The second number belongs to Sayyed
Mohammed Naved, also his cousin.

1996
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:26,240
Then Sameena Begum, his cousin's wife.

1997
01:53:26,440 --> 01:53:27,920
Mr Arshad Mumtaz

1998
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:31,400
and his wife Roohi Mohammed,
cousins again.

1999
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:33,320
She is the same Roohi Mohammed

2000
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:35,880
from whom Bilaal Mohammed
had borrowed 1500 dollars

2001
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:37,360
for his heart surgery,

2002
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:41,280
which he received on the day
of the blast, coincidently.

2003
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:47,160
Mr Danish, do you believe in Islam?

2004
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,560
Yes, I do.
- Objection, Your Honour.

2005
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:51,440
Why does a serving officer's religion
matter in this case?

2006
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:54,560
Sir, I think the entire case
is related to religion,

2007
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,280
and I shall prove that right now.

2008
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,840
Danish, do you believe that every
Muslim is not a terrorist?

2009
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:04,480
Yes, I do.

2010
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,840
And is every Muslim a terrorist?

2011
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:13,640
I think so, based on my experience.

2012
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:15,680
What is the definition
of terrorism, Danish?

2013
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,080
Objection, Your Honour.

2014
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:19,480
Will the definition of terrorism
be written in court?

2015
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:21,680
The unlawful use of
violence or intimidation

2016
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:24,640
especially against civilians in
the pursuit of political or social aims.

2017
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,080
That's the definition of terrorism.

2018
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,560
Thank you.

2019
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:30,280
The unlawful use of
violence or intimidation

2020
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:35,000
especially against civilians in
the pursuit of political or social aims.

2021
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:39,080
Use of violence
for political or social aims,

2022
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:42,280
especially against civilians.

2023
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:45,200
Am I right?
- Yes.

2024
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:47,200
Did you notice there was

2025
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,840
no religion mentioned
in the definition? - Yes.

2026
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:54,440
So, how can you decide
this is terrorism and this is not?

2027
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,760
Danish, you can choose not to answer.

2028
01:54:56,840 --> 01:55:00,320
Who decides this is
terrorism and this is not?

2029
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:01,840
Objection, Your Honour.

2030
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:04,440
Is untouchability terrorism?

2031
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:08,560
Is assaulting the innocent
tribal population terrorism?

2032
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:10,200
The upper class people humiliate

2033
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,600
the lower class, is that terrorism?
- Objection, Your Honour.

2034
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,800
Or do you think Islamic terrorism

2035
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,360
is the only terrorism?
- I object, Your Honour.

2036
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,600
Santosh, let me finish!

2037
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:25,040
For how many years have you been
working in the anti-terrorist squad?

2038
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:28,200
I strongly object, Your Honour.

2039
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:30,320
For almost ten years.

2040
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,960
And how many Muslims
are there in your team?

2041
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:34,600
I strongly object, Your Honour.

2042
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,920
Enough, Miss Aarti,
there's no relevance.

2043
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:39,840
My lord, in this case, there has been

2044
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,960
a historical and
mythological significance

2045
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:45,160
even of the names of the accused
and his family, so, I...

2046
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:46,240
All right, go on,

2047
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:47,680
but come to the point soon.

2048
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:48,800
Thank you, sir.

2049
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:52,480
Tell me. How many Muslims
are there in your team?

2050
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:54,880
Very few.

2051
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:56,000
Why?

2052
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:59,200
Because most of your
targets are Muslims?

2053
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:01,360
Yes.

2054
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:03,640
In the heat of the moment,
has it ever happened

2055
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:06,840
that your team forgot
that you're Muslim yourself

2056
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,080
and said something offensive
to Muslims in front of you?

2057
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:10,240
I don't remember.

2058
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:12,240
Don't remember? Or it never happened?

2059
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:14,720
Never?

2060
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:15,960
Maybe,

2061
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,800
but in the heat of the moment,
sometimes... - Right.

2062
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:21,760
And did you ever feel

2063
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,360
that some people are bringing
a bad name to the entire community?

2064
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,800
Every time.

2065
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:28,920
That's the point, my lord.

2066
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:32,600
This entire case is
based on prejudice.

2067
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:36,720
The investigating officer of this case
Danish Javed is a Muslim himself,

2068
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:39,160
is prejudiced that some people

2069
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:41,840
are bringing bad name
to the entire community,

2070
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:44,960
and their agenda is to prove

2071
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,560
and to set an example

2072
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:49,880
that nobody becomes like Shahid.

2073
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,160
Right or wrong?

2074
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:52,920
Yes or no?

2075
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:56,080
Isn't it true that
you could've arrested him?

2076
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:57,960
Yes or no, Officer Danish Javed?

2077
01:56:58,040 --> 01:56:59,880
Objection, Your Honour.
- You could've arrested him,

2078
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:01,800
but you killed him by shooting at him.

2079
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:03,160
Yes or no?

2080
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:06,280
Objection, Your Honour.
- Don't you want to prove that

2081
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:09,640
nobody dares to become another Shahid?
- I strongly object, Your Honour!

2082
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,960
The family too will meet the same fate!
- Objection, Your Honour!

2083
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,760
Yes or no?
- I strongly object!

2084
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:15,920
Did you want the same for this family?
- Yes!

2085
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:18,240
Yes.

2086
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:30,600
That's all, my lord.

2087
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:32,680
You may go now.

2088
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:42,800
Santosh, closing arguments.

2089
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:49,480
My lord, there's a wonderful proverb.

2090
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:53,320
'How will we convince
them to be ours?'

2091
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:55,520
'They don't consider us their kin.'

2092
01:57:56,680 --> 01:57:57,840
Your Honour,

2093
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:00,760
two boys from this family

2094
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,600
knew a dreaded terrorist
for a long time,

2095
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:08,160
and one of them killed
16 innocent Indians.

2096
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:12,480
The prosecution has produced
the evidence to the court

2097
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:16,320
that this family made the plan
in their Badar Manzil house.

2098
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:19,120
Nodal Officer Ajit Yadav
produced the evidence.

2099
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:23,000
It is clear through CCTV footage

2100
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:28,080
that Bilaal Mohammed knew terrorist
Mehfooz Alam for a long time,

2101
01:58:28,160 --> 01:58:32,400
and he got 14 SIM cards
activated for Mehfooz Alam

2102
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:34,640
without examining the documents,

2103
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:40,680
out of which, four SIM cards were used
by the terrorists in Allahabad blast.

2104
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:44,280
There were several calls made
from unknown numbers

2105
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:48,480
from Pakistan to Bilaal Mohammed
and Ali Mohammed,

2106
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,280
and they also received a fee

2107
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:56,600
of 1500 US dollars exactly
four hours after the blast.

2108
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:59,560
Murad Ali Mohammed

2109
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,720
has a history of 25 years

2110
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,520
being associated with rioters.

2111
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:10,400
Hence, the prosecution
requests the court

2112
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:14,480
to grant Murad Ali Mohammed
the most severe of punishments

2113
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:19,080
seeing which
no citizen of the country will

2114
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:23,320
ever dare to involve
in anti-national activities.

2115
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:26,320
According to the Indian Penal Code,

2116
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:28,920
there can't be nothing less

2117
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:32,960
than death penalty
for this heinous crime.

2118
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:35,760
That's all, Your Honour.

2119
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,480
Aarti.

2120
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,600
Sir, it's a beautiful couplet.

2121
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,520
'How will we convince
them to be ours?'

2122
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:50,880
'They don't consider us their kin.'

2123
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:53,920
Us and them.

2124
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:56,600
Us and them.

2125
01:59:58,120 --> 02:00:03,440
Sir, tragically, this case is not about
Shahid, Bilaal or Ali Mohammed.

2126
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:06,520
This case is about 'Us' and 'Them'.

2127
02:00:07,480 --> 02:00:09,360
Judge, there are different kinds
of people in this court.

2128
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,120
My family and I have to prove
that we are innocent.

2129
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:15,720
Santosh Anand,

2130
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,880
Danish Javed and all these officers,

2131
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:21,720
have decided that
this is a family of terrorists.

2132
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:31,680
These people too.

2133
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:34,400
They have nothing to do
with this case.

2134
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,560
Few of them may be reporters,

2135
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:39,760
few people who are
interested in this case,

2136
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:42,480
but I don't know if you noticed or not

2137
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,720
that whenever Santosh Anand
made any accusation like,

2138
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:48,080
'There are more kids in
their community,'

2139
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:49,880
'or the literacy level is less,'

2140
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,680
everyone used to laugh.

2141
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:56,120
Can you tell me what made you laugh?

2142
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:00,360
Can you tell me?

2143
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:04,880
Sir, can you tell me?

2144
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:10,240
They were laughing on

2145
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:12,600
the community with more children

2146
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,520
and lower literacy rates

2147
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:16,640
because that is his community,

2148
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:18,280
not theirs.

2149
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,000
Us and them.

2150
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:29,160
Sir, a country cannot be divided into
parts by drawing lines on a paper.

2151
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,400
It is divided in our minds,

2152
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:33,760
by colour, language,

2153
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,480
religion, and caste.

2154
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:38,920
Santosh Anand has divided this country

2155
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:41,280
very beautifully in 'Us' and 'Them'.

2156
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:45,080
It is their punishment

2157
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:49,040
which Santosh Anand announced
before you could give your verdict.

2158
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:54,040
He's taught them the same bias
which he believes in.

2159
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:56,840
Judge, I am reiterating myself,

2160
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:00,520
this case is based on prejudice.

2161
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:04,280
Badar Manzil is the house
which was built in 1927,

2162
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,160
a family lives in it,

2163
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:09,560
who chose the country
when they had to choose

2164
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:11,640
between country or religion in 1947.

2165
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:14,520
This is a country where people
speak 150 languages,

2166
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:16,120
follow many religions,

2167
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:20,720
how can you do justice with the bias
between 'Us' and 'Them' in that country?

2168
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:22,360
I really don't understand.

2169
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:27,280
Gandhi was not killed by a community.

2170
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:30,000
He was killed by a man.

2171
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:33,720
You can't blame
his community for his crime.

2172
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:36,840
Terrorism is a criminal act,

2173
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:39,120
not a communal act.

2174
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:43,080
If every Muslim is weighed
in the same weighing scale,

2175
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:47,400
then one-fourth of the population
of this world will be under suspicion.

2176
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:49,880
We have to find other ways, sir.

2177
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:52,080
Sonkar and Chaubey have to go
to Ali Mohammed's house

2178
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:54,280
and tell him that they are with him.

2179
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,960
Aayat, Bilaal, Ali Mohammed will have

2180
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:59,120
to keep an eye on Shahid and Rashid.

2181
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:02,280
Only then, this country will become
the best country in the world.

2182
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:05,240
The country can't stand divided.

2183
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,960
All of us are a part of this country.

2184
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:12,480
Shahid was responsible
for his own death.

2185
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:15,200
Who will take the responsibility
of Bilaal's death?

2186
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:17,480
He was unwell.

2187
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,400
The money that he saved
for his treatment

2188
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:21,920
was considered as the fees for Jihad.

2189
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:25,200
Aayat lost her father,
Tabassum lost her husband.

2190
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:27,280
Sir, who will look after them?

2191
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:38,720
Defence refutes all the allegations
by the prosecution.

2192
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,720
I request the court

2193
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:43,160
that the accused should be acquitted.

2194
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:45,400
I rest my case here, sir.

2195
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:48,400
Thank you.

2196
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:56,160
I'll give the verdict in an hour,
after the recess.

2197
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,920
You argued over two cases.

2198
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:18,840
I can give the verdict for one, not two.

2199
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:21,880
But I can suggest you something.

2200
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:26,640
Ali Mohammed, if anyone questions
your beard hereafter,

2201
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:28,480
don't get emotional,

2202
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,520
and don't get angry.

2203
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:31,880
This book,

2204
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:35,600
the Constitution of India.

2205
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:40,480
Get three or four photocopies
of the first page.

2206
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:43,760
Show that paper to anyone
who questions you.

2207
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:46,560
If they still continue to trouble you,
we'll handle it.

2208
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:48,360
These are fringe elements.

2209
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:50,880
You're getting them to the mainstream
by reacting.

2210
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:54,240
Your brother died during the case,

2211
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,400
the court and I are sorry for the loss.

2212
02:04:57,440 --> 02:04:58,880
I'm also upset

2213
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:01,720
that you couldn't control your son.

2214
02:05:02,240 --> 02:05:04,720
You can't be punished for that.

2215
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:06,680
Control the guys,

2216
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:09,960
watch them, who they meet,
what they watch,

2217
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:12,760
what booster antenna they use...

2218
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:15,480
Terrorists are not agents of Islam.

2219
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:18,280
They are misusing Islam

2220
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,080
for business and politics.

2221
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:21,960
If we acknowledge it,

2222
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:24,040
we'll find a way to escape from it.

2223
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:28,960
Danish, you're prejudiced against
your own community.

2224
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:30,920
You must've known that.

2225
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:35,640
If you weren't,
you would've filed a case

2226
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:37,360
instead of talking about Hawala
for so many days.

2227
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:39,440
You are more interested in

2228
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:42,280
terrorism and encounters.

2229
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:44,200
Your focus is on that.

2230
02:05:44,720 --> 02:05:46,520
Change your outlook,

2231
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,840
the world will look clearer to you.

2232
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,160
Santosh Anand,

2233
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:57,800
no one present in the court would
know their grandparent's name.

2234
02:05:57,880 --> 02:06:01,000
You're talking about a man named Bilaal

2235
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:02,720
from the 7th century.

2236
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,920
Is this how we are going to solve
the problems of 2018?

2237
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:10,480
Who came first? Who came later?

2238
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:14,840
If we discuss this after 500 years,
we'll lag 5000 behind.

2239
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,920
You lied in court.

2240
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:20,800
Abdul Kalam, Abdul Hamid and

2241
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:24,120
Bismillah Khan are exceptions
in the Muslim community.

2242
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:29,720
You must have read this
message on WhatsApp, right?

2243
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:34,040
Had you utilised your time
to go through history,

2244
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:37,440
rather than watching news channels
and using WhatsApp,

2245
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,440
you would've known

2246
02:06:39,560 --> 02:06:41,600
how many Muslims are terrorists

2247
02:06:41,720 --> 02:06:43,800
and how many of them
have made our country proud.

2248
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:45,600
I can tell you the names,

2249
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,200
but it is not my job.

2250
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:55,040
As for the rest of you,
Danish gave a definition of terrorism.

2251
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:58,080
Even after leaving this room,
don't forget that.

2252
02:06:58,280 --> 02:06:59,600
A bomb blast is an act of terrorism,

2253
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:01,800
but there are many more things
that are acts of terrorism.

2254
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:03,800
If we don't allow lectures
in the temple

2255
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:05,600
and prayers in the parliament,

2256
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:08,000
everything will be under control.

2257
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:11,680
Whenever someone

2258
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:14,920
tries to divide us,

2259
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:19,600
misguide us,

2260
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:23,080
go home and check the calendar,

2261
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:26,200
check how many days are
left for the elections.

2262
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:29,080
Ali Mohammed,

2263
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:31,560
I acquit you.

2264
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:37,200
The court discards
all the allegations on you.

2265
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:47,920
Wow.

2266
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:51,440
Law got the better of religion
again today.

2267
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:54,120
Congratulations.

2268
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,760
Dad, I won.

2269
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:11,720
Very good.

2270
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:19,720
Come on.

2271
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:27,400
Will you forgive me?

2272
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:33,960
Had you told me earlier,
this wouldn't have happened.

2273
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:40,160
Sir, if you look for love,

2274
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,240
you'll find it.

2275
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:11,600
Dear,

2276
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:15,960
I got Bilaal acquitted.

2277
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:31,800
"All the seven colours
belong to my beloved."

2278
