What is your inspiration
for this show?

9
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,508
Well, as far as our company's
inspiration is concerned..

10
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,104

of clothes we've shown..

12
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,117
..very vibrant colours and very
young styles and designs.

13
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,120
Are you working global?
- Yes.

14
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,125
Every company wishes to work
globally in any field.

15
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,127
And, we're trying for the
international market.

16
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,130
And, we're looking at
buyers from America..

17
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,132
..and most of Europe, so
let's see how far we get.

18
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:56,536
Hopefully, right on top.

19
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,802
What about your love life?
- My love life?

20
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,814
It's non-existent for right now.

21
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,153
And, nobody knows what the
future has in store for us.

22
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,153
So, let's see.

23
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,555
Anyway, thank you very much.

24
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,149
Really nice talking to you.

25
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,319
Please enjoy the party.

26
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,487
Thank you.

27
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,689
Thank you.
- Thank you.

28
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,163
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

29
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,166
Thank you.

30
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,500
How you doing?
- Fine, thank you.

31
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:32,168
Oh! What a pleasant surprise!

32
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,507
Hi!
- Hi. - You're having fun!?

33
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,911
Thank you. Thank you very much.

34
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,182
It's so good to see you.
It's so exciting.

35
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,184
Hi.
- Hi.

36
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:49,192
The one that is being
protected by the air.

37
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,195
How can that candle diffuse
which is been cared by God?

38
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,527
Nice.
- Nice?

39
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,192
One more.

40
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,202
No, no, no.
- For my sake. One last.

41
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,207
The Zamana (world) has
not guts to erase us..

42
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,743
..since the world is with us
and we're not with the world.

43
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,213
What is Zamana (world)?
- Zamana?

44
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,542
You don't know Zamana?
- No.

45
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,210
Zamana (world) is like
Jamana (To set).

46
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,219
Jamana?
- Thikana (abode).

47
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,220
Thikanal?
- Didn't get it.

48
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,551
It's like Hasana (To make laugh).

49
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:23,822
What is Hasana (To make laugh)?
- What is Hasanal?

50
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,227
Hasana is like; what
is want with you!

51
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,559
What you want with me!?
- Yes, Hasana.

52
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,225
I think you're talking something
else. - No, no.

53
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,237
Raj! Can I ask you something?

54
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,241
Tell me, Diana.
- What is the meaning of Hasana?

55
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,244
You're gonna get us in a fix.

56
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,246
Actually, he's talking about
an Indian love story.

57
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,248
Buddy, I really don't waste time.

58
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,648
That's all right. Still,
there's a way to talk.

59
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,252
Decency. Huh?

60
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,584
Okay.

61
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,784
Okay, Mr. Decent man! Okay.

62
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,986
Who is that decent man?

63
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,262
Hello! He's that decent man.

64
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,264
I'm Sameer and she's my bird.

65
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,594
Oh! Diana.

66
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,259
Diana, wish her.
- Hi.

67
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,597
Hi. Nice to meet you.

68
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,262
You've set up everything great.

69
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:12,604
This party, the show and these
designs and your name as well.

70
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,606
Thank you.

71
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,943
By the way, your style of
appreciation is quite good.

72
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,680
Marble is the main thing in Taj.

73
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,286
And, style is the main thing in Raj.

74
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,287
I say, hello.

75
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,290
Great. You're quite a funny man.

76
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,291
No, rather he's a man who always
lands us in problems.

77
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,295
By the way, I'm Raj Oberoi.

78
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,297
Don't get misled with the surname.

79
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,301
I'm no industrialist's son.
But, a simpleton.

80
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,907
I deal in cutting in fixing.
Just like you. - Meaning?

81
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,307
Meaning.. you cut the fabric and
fix them and make designs.

82
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,844
And, I cut the frames and
join them and make films.

83
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,642
Oh!

84
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,307
It seems my colleagues have
selected the right man.

85
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,978
Not the right man,
but the decent man.

86
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,317
By the way your show was too great..

87
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,327
..but I didn't like one thing.

88
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,330
What?

89
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,330
It ended quite fast, isn't it?

90
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,337
Perfect, man.

91
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,737
It was really nice meeting
you all.. and, have fun.

92
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,343
I really liked meeting you.

93
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,878
Yes, the meeting was quite great,
but it was a bit short.

94
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,080
The first meeting should
always be short.

95
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,942
Bye.
- Bye.

96
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,681
Okay, take care. Good bye.

97
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,396
Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,401
Actually, my car broke down
and I was waiting for a taxi.

99
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,732
By the way.. if I ask you as to
whether can I give you a lift?

100
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,408
Then you'll say, 'No, Raj.
I'll go by a taxi.'

101
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,738
But, if I insist that your
home is on my way..

102
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,007
"then, perhaps you'll agree to it.

103
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,742
You shouldn't waste time
in just talking..

104
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,408
..and simply sit in the car.

105
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,421
Should we move if you've
ended your talk?

106
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,751
Why not?

107
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,951
My house is on that side.
- This way.

108
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,425
Yes.
- Okay.

109
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,177
If you don't mind.. can you
put down the AC? - Oh!

110
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,450
I'm sorry.
- I'm feeling chilly.

111
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,452
All right?

112
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,792
By the way.. I've already told it.

113
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,455
But, I would like to say it again..

114
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,469
You're gorgeous.

115
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,009
I mean.. you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

116
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,504
Can I offer you some coffee?

117
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,834
Sounds good.

118
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,497
But, I'm not that
decent so as I'll..

119
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,509
..miss the opportunity..

120
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,840
..to meet you for the third time.

121
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,515
Some other time.

122
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,516
Bye. See you.
- Thank you. Bye.

123
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,550
Oh, wow! Just look at this! Just
look at the coverage! - Yeah.

124
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,143
It's excellent. - Put this blue
on the side. - Yes, ma'am.

125
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,882
See this one also.

126
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,560
This very show has given
us so much coverage.

127
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,562
Wow! This is excellent!

128
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,894
Rekha, our first show has reaped
so much of profit for us..

129
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,056
"You see the way the buyers
are making phone calls".

130
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,568
..you just can't.. excuse me.

131
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,570
Where is my phone?

132
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,901
Just a minute.

133
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,566
Hello?
- Hi, Sia.

134
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,971
Oh! Decent man.

135
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,238
How are you?
- I'm fine, Sia.

136
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:19,582
Sia, tell me something.. so far
we've met two times, isn't it?

137
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,979
So?

138
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,111
So, after these two meetings,
so is it possible for me to..

139
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,178
..invite you and that you won't
decline my invitation?

140
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,590
Raj, what do you want to say?
I'm really not getting it.

141
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,254
Come right away to my office.
- Right awayl?

142
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,130
See? Didn't I say
that you'll refuse?

143
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,261
Raj, I'm not refusing, but
tell me; what's the matter?

144
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,932
Sia, the matter that is
disclosed on the phone..

145
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,598
..is really not a matter.

146
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,608
Come, please.

147
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,006
Fine, I'll come.

148
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,627
Diana..
- Yeah?

149
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,631
There was a block buster film
called Gadar. - Gadar?

150
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,961
Wish you could have seen Gadar.

151
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,625
A Tara Singh was required
to rescue..

152
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,637
..Sakina madam from Pakistan.

153
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,967
But, I can easily rescue
you from Bangkok.

154
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,633
Oh, shut up.
- Trust me.

155
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,641
No, problem.

156
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,177
Hi.
- Oh, hi!

157
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,645
Hi, Sia, how are you?
- Very well. How are you?

158
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,045
Very good.
- Where's Raj?

159
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,640
Raj was just somewhere..

160
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:27,979
Hi, Sia.
- Here he comes.

161
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,644
Hi.
- Right in front of you.

162
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,654
And, how could have it
been possible for me..

163
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,814
..to call you over here
and not to be present?

164
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,050
Moreover, why shouldn't he make..

165
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,184
..20 rounds in 10 minutes
while waiting for you?

166
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,659
Shut up. I was just walking.

167
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,660
By the way, a walk is quite
good for the health.

168
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,992
Yeah.

169
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,329
So, let's walk?
- Excuse me.

170
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,669
Lucky man.

171
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,671
He has got a story.

172
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,001
God make my story.

173
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,269
You know, what is Jamana?
- Jamana?

174
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,674
Thikana?
- Oh! Not again.

175
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,006
No?

176
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,344
Your office is so beautiful.
- Yeah, but not more than you.

177
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:02,014
What?
- No, actually.. Sia, actually l..

178
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,281
Tell me what's the matter?
- I don't want to tell..

179
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,687
..rather I want to show something.
- What?

180
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,691
Have patience, my dear.

181
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,693
Please come.

182
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,735
Don't you find it nice?

183
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,734
What are you talking, Raj?

184
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,738
I never thought that our
show will look so great.

185
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,740
This is absolutely fantastic.

186
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,744
Then"

187
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,747
Not mere appreciation will do.
- Then?

188
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,749
One cup coffee?

189
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,755
Sia, your business needs
a strategist, I mean you..

190
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,758
Sugar?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you. - Okay.

191
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,761
I mean, your designs should be
at a place, which they deserve.

192
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,764
You designs will be on every TV
channel and on every news item.

193
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,095
Isn't it great?

194
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,759
And, for this we need to take
the help of electronic media.

195
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,771
That's the idea.

196
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,773
There's some hard work, but..
that's not a big problem.

197
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,106
And, if you take my word..
then we can get..

198
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,770
..a global exposure because of this.

199
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,177
And, I'll make sure of that.

200
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,442
You don't at all worry. I'll
take care of everything.

201
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,115
Why are you looking at me like this?

202
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,315
I was thinking.. as to why
are you so much interested?

203
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,118
Did I show too much of interest?

204
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,783
No, no. I was just saying.

205
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,793
Then, I think I was right.

206
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,808
Give me three-four days more.

207
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,807
I'll find out it's details.

208
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,828
Hello.
- Hello, Raj.

209
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:30,832
Yes, tell me, Sia.
- Raj.. can I ask you for a favour?

210
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,833
Of course, Sia. Tell me.

211
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,499
Raj.. I wanted to see
that edit once more.

212
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,845
Sia..

213
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,573
I think that you're sitting for the
first time on a bike, isn't it?

214
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,851
Why?

215
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,854
Because, a beautiful girl like you..

216
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,859
...will never sit like this behind
a handsome chap like me.

217
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,865
ls it fine, now?

218
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,404
Sia, I consider you
more beautiful than me.

219
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,884
Sorry, Raj. I disturbed
you so late at night.

220
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,215
If you really want to say
sorry.. then stay mum.

221
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,222
By the way, there are a lot many
things to say better than sorry.

222
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,897
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,285
O, beloved.

224
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,618
O, beloved.

225
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:51,975
I've turned eighteen, so dear,
take me from here.

226
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,135
O, beloved.

227
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,972
O, beloved.

228
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:00,973
I've turned eighteen, so dear,
take me from here.

229
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,988
I've turned eighteen, so dear,
take me from here.

230
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,991
The days are difficult to pass.

231
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,992
And, I count the
nights restlessly.

232
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,326
The days are difficult to pass.

233
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,989
And, I count the
nights restlessly.

234
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,000
Come and get to know
about my state.

235
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,005
And, dear, take me from here.

236
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,007
O, beloved.

237
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,339
O, beloved.

238
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,002
Come and get to know
about my state.

239
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,015
And, dear, take me from here.

240
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:38,020
I've turned eighteen, so dear,
take me from here.

241
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,041
The mind suggests that
I sing something.

242
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,046
And, it suggests me to jingle
my anklets as well.

243
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,641
The mind suggests that
I sing something.

244
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,381
And, it suggests me to jingle
my anklets as well.

245
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,049
I have fallen in love
just like Radha had loved Shyam

246
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,456
And, dear, take me from here.

247
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,587
O, beloved.

248
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,062
I have fallen in love
just like Radha had loved Shyam

249
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,066
And, dear, take me from here.

250
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:30,071
I've turned eighteen, so dear,
take me from here.

251
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:49,091
O, dear!

252
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:53,085
O, dear!

253
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,098
All my friends have went
away with their hubbies..

254
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,100
"but, mine is yet to come.

255
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,103
All my friends have went
away with their hubbies..

256
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,266
"but, mine is yet to come.

257
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,104
I've painted my dress in red.

258
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,113
So, dear, take me from here.

259
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,115
O, dear! O, dear!

260
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,708
I've painted my dress in red.

261
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,118
So, dear, take me from here.

262
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:23,659
I've turned eighteen, so dear,
take me from here.

263
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,126
The days are difficult to pass.

264
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,460
And, I count the
nights restlessly.

265
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,123
The days are difficult to pass.

266
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,736
And, I count the
nights restlessly.

267
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,466
Come and get to know
about my state.

268
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,134
And, dear, take me from here.

269

O, beloved. O, beloved.

I've turned eighteen, so dear,
take me from here.

271
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:52,153
I've turned eighteen, so dear,
take me from here.

272
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,158
O, beloved. O, beloved.
O, beloved.

273
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,162
O, beloved. O, dear! O, dear!

274
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,517
Oh, my God!

275
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,181
This is a letter from Richmond
Global Incorporate.

276
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,523
They want to deal with us!
They want to deal with us!

277
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,187
They want to do global
business with us!

278
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,197
Oh, my God! This is great!

279
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,197
We're gonna be so big!

280
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,529
Diana, listen. Listen to me.
- Yeah?

281
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,728
Do you know that white
girl who was..

282
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,795
...In love with the hero
in 'Lagaan?' - Yeah.

283
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,206
Oh, God! That white ma'am
looks exactly like you.

284
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:50,212
Beautiful! Tall! Blonde! With
a royal touch! - Thank you.

285
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,542
Welcome.

286
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,607
And, the hero was exactly like
me. Short, sweet and cute.

287
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,209
No?
- What do you want to say?

288
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,220
I want to say that why
come he created..

289
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,619
..the same magic again and time for?

290
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,214
Such a great history again.

291
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,623
History is okay. But, it
will affect geography.

292
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,230
Geography?
- Because you fail in it.

293
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,231
Raj!

294
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,391
Where were you?

295
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,627
What happened?
- Hi.

296
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,226
Yeah.

297
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,236
Are you in love?
- Why do you say so?

298
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,569
Because you cant stop smiling
and your face is glowing.

299
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,244
You're right, Diana. I'm in love.

300
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,574
So.. who's the lucky girl?

301
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,239
She's..
- She's there? - Yeah.

302
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,249
The lucky girl.
- Excuse me. - Excused.

303
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,249
Hi, Raj.
- Hi, Sia.

304
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,786
I've good news.
- Tell me.

305
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,585
Your strategy has worked.
- What are you talking about?

306
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,250
A while ago I received a call
from Richmond Global.

307
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,260
Hey, that's fantastic, Sia!
- Exactly!

308
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,590
They saw our work on television
and they liked it.

309
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:41,790
Now, they want to deal with us.

310
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,265
They will represent you?
- Yes, absolutely.

311
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,426
Globally?
- Globally.

312
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,662
And, thanks to you.

313
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,262
It's all because of you. Come
right away to my house.

314
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,603
Sia, I've just reached the office.
How can I come right away?

315
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,276
Oh, c'mon, Raj.

316
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,608
I'll see you, guys.
- Okay. - Sure.

317
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:02,284
Diana, Raj's face was glowing, no?

318
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,286
When will my face glow?
- Right now.

319
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,286
Howl?

320
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,322
Good house.

321
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,339
Look.. you called me and I've come.

322
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,347
Missed you so much.

323
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,346
Smile please.

324
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,356
How is it possible that you
call me and I don't come?

325
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,686
I'll shun the world if you say so.

326
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,350
Do you know what was Diana saying?

327
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,362
She was saying that
my face is glowing.

328
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,692
It's true, Ria.

329
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,355
Ever since I met you..

330
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,370
I feel that I've changed.

331
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,372
I love you so much.

332
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,377
What's this? You're still angry.

333
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,707
Look, I cannot afford
to make you angry.

334
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,382
At least, smile please.

335
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,402
<i>Y g“!</i>

336
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,994
So? Didn't you get a shock?

337
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,735
Sia..
- She's my twin sister Ria.

338
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,408
Twin?

339
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,413
I'm really sorry, Ria.
I thought that..

340
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,816
Actually, there's not an iota
of difference between you both.

341
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,421
I'm really sorry, Ria.

342
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,751
But, anyone can be
led into the trap.

343
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,416
But, why didn't you say that
you're not Sia but Ria?

344
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,757
That's because she can neither
speak nor listen.

345
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,421
What?!

346
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,829
I'm really sorry, Ria.
- No, no.

347
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,427
Ria hates the people who
shower sympathy on her.

348
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,436
Furthermore, I informed
you about it.

349
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,441
Or else you would have never known
that she's deaf and dumb.

350
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,838
Do you know..

351
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,436
even if you make her stand
amidst a 100 people..

352
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,447
..then she can easily make
out what they are saying..

353
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,449
..through their lip movements.

354
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,781
In a way, we were born five
minutes of each other.

355
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,454
But, as far intellect is concerned..

356
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,783
..she's years ahead than me.

357
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,448
Raj, do you know.. those designs..

358
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,458
..that you saw in
that fashion show..

359
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,857
..they were all Ria's creation.

360
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,987
My sister is genius.

361
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:02,053
I'm simply the public
face of the company.

362
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,793
Just a PRO.

363
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:07,462
And, that too because Ria
simply hates crowd.

364
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,868
She has an allergy with parties.

365
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,203
She likes to stay alone.

366
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,475
And, she mostly does everything
from house itself.

367
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,808
And, if she's gotten herself
into something..

368
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,472
..then he can never leave
that thing unfinished.

369
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,482
And, he's Raj.

370
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,814
The man in my life.

371
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,819
Tell me, Ria?

372
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,484
How did you like my choice?

373
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,497
Ria, your designs are
just terrific like you.

374
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,828
Had I met you before Sia
then I would have..

375
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,503
...really fallen in love with you.

376
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:51,164
No matter you raze down
a temple or a mosque.

377
00:27:56,574 --> 00:28:02,855
Because the great saint,
Bulleshah says..

378
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:12,533
But, don't ever break a
heart filled with love.

379
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:20,873
..that it's the abode
of the of the beloved.

380
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:28,539
It's the abode of the beloved.

381
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,558
I've stirred the pain of love.

382
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:45,560
I've started the fire of love.

383
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,570
I've stirred the pain of love.

384
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,901
I've started the fire of love.

385
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:58,571
I've got myself into reading
the lips of the beloved.

386
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:05,586
And, lo, I've missed that
beloved's love in my life.

387
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,592
I've stirred the pain of love.

388
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:18,600
I've started the fire of love.

389
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,634
The Lord has played such a game.

390
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,637
That, it's all sorrow in my life.

391
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,643
The Lord has played such a game.

392
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,645
That, it's all sorrow in my life.

393
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,978
And, I was alone yesterday,
and I'm alone today.

394
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,643
But, the hope hasn't
yet shattered.

395
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:15,650
The hope indeed hasn't
yet shattered.

396
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,663
But, I've lost all
my peace of mind.

397
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,666
Lo, I've missed that beloved's
love in my life.

398
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:33,674
Lo, I've missed that beloved's
love in my life.

399
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:39,010
Raj, I and Ria are everything
for each other.

400
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:43,014
Mother, father, brother. Everything.

401
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,019
We simply understand by
each other's look..

402
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,692
..as to what we want to say.

403
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,693
Since she cannot speak and hear,
so I pay much heed..

404
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,697
...lest to miss any of her reaction.

405
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,698
Do you know, Raj.. we're both are..

406
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,100
..not just habitual of each other..

407
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,695
..rather we're the
need of each other.

408
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,368
ls Ria like this since childhood?
- No, Raj.

409
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,043
It was when we were of
around eight years..

410
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,707
..that we lost our parents
in a car accident.

411
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,046
And, along with that Ria lost her
power of speech and hearing.

412
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,719
At that time, our uncle brought
us along to Bangkok..

413
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,724
..and it was he who raised us.

414
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,727
We've reached this far with
each other's support.

415
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,731
I made a lot many efforts to
get rid of Ria's handicap..

416
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,733
...I met many a doctors. But
everyone has the same to say..

417
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,066
..that it's not an ENT problem.

418
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,747
It's some kind of a neurological
disorder.

419
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:50,752
After that accident, Ria
has lost a part of hers..

420
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:55,086
..that controls the speech and
hearing senses of humans.

421
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,760
Every doctor said the same thing..

422
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,762
..that the operation is risky.

423
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,095
And, I don't want to take
any risk for Ria.

424
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:11,102
Raj.. I'm happy with Ria,
no matter how she is.

425
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,764
Sia..

426
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,775
My love for you has
augmented after..

427
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,780
...I came to know about you and Ria.

428
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,784
I mean..

429
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,116
There's great love among every
brother and sister, Raj.

430
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:29,450
But, our bonds are too strong
since we're twins.

431
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,792
She's a great sister.

432
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,793
We always thought that
we don't need..

433
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,127
..anyone else in our lives.

434
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,789
We felt complete together.

435
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,793
And, then..

436
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,805
..you came.

437
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,079
Hello?

438
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,589
Raj, where are you? I am searching
for you since so long.

439
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,319
Sia, I was at home.
The phone was dead.

440
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,519
Okay, fine. Come to Central
Plaza quickly.

441
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,925
lam waiting for you.

442
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,327
I will be back in ten mins.

443
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:49,456
Fine, I will be there.

444
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,261
Come quickly.
- Bye.

445
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:35,096
What is this? You
are studying a lot?

446
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,099
Ria?

447
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,102
Right.

448
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,433
Sia must be inside.
I will just come.

449
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,500
So you are Sia.

450
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,111
This is a great problem.
It is difficult..

451
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,847
..to understand who is Sia and Ria.

452
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,380
Please say something.

453
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,456
One needs to look at
their love with..

454
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,325
..the eyes of their heart
to recognize it, Raj.

455
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,126
ls it so?

456
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,129
If you agree.

457
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:15,466
Not here, Raj. Let's go inside.

458
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,160
What is the matter?

459
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,222
All of a sudden, you love me a lot?

460
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,222
Hey.. looking gorgeous.

461
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,627
What happened?

462
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,429
Because you applied the lipstick?

463
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,231
Come on, Raj. We are getting late.

464
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,396
Come on, let's go.

465
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,410
Come on.. come on..

466
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,912
The volley ball match in the middle
of the beach has started.

467
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,319
And I am seeing that on one side..

468
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,857
..there is Raj and Diana,
and on the other side..

469
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,324
..there is Sia and her companions.

470
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,266
Wow.. this beautiful
service of Diana.

471
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,268
And more than the service, the one..

472
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,861
..who is doing this service is
beautiful. Sia has lifted the ball..

473
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,270
This is Diana coming
from a distance..

474
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:32,864
..and she is trying
to reach the ball..

475
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,671
..and her try..

476
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:43,283
Diana has fallen down. See,
if she is hurt.. Diana..

477
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,289
And the ball has been
lifted up nicely".

478
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,954
..and Diana has tried
her level best..

479
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,357
Volley..

480
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:09,469
Good..

481
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,603
Very good.

482
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,648
Wow.. very good. Buck
up, Sia. Buck up.

483
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,715
And both the teams are..

484
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,848
And Sia's team has lost.

485
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,384
Stop it, Raj.

486
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,750
And another point.

487
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,346
And Raj's team has won it.

488
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,413
Applause"

489
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,436
Enough. Diana.

490
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,447
Raj"

491
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,423
Sia..

492
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,435
What happened?

493
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,443
Any problem?

494
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,946
Are you angry that I hugged Raj?

495
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,509
Come on, it was just
a game. Me and Raj..

496
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,731
Help me.

497
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:02,812
Help me..

498
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:03,977
Help!

499
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,543
He
p..

500
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,514
No..

501
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:52,593
Doctor Harrison of Neurosurgery.

502
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,257
Sia, the doctor about whom
I am speaking about..

503
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,599
..he is the best doctor
for neurosurgery.

504
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,597
I think that if we take Ria to him..

505
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:08,666
..there are chances that
she can be cured.

506
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,223
The operation has been successful.

507
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,126
Will she be able to speak again?

508
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:31,632
For that, we will have
to wait till the..

509
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:36,694
..22nd of the next month.
- Thank you, very much, doctor.

510
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,637
Thank you.

511
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,038
My Ria will be able to speak.

512
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,638
You don't know since when I have
been waiting for this day.

513
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,252
Ria will be able to
call me with my name.

514
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,654
She will be able to listen.

515
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,324
Now, when the doctor
has given a date..

516
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,382
..it seems that time has stopped.

517
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:03,164
How will this time be passed?
I can't wait.

518
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,673
Yes, sir.

519
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,003
Looking at the dead body,
it seems that the murder..

520
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,170
..took place between ten and
ten thirty in the night.

521
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,206
It seems that the murderer
doesn't have a heart.

522
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,374
We don't know who the murderer is.

523
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:58,719
But we will find it.

524
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,725
There isn't any thing wrong.

525
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,920
We tried our level best.

526
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:10,727
But Ria won't be able
to listen or speak.

527
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,794
I am sorry.

528
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,945
Ria..

529
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:02,779
Tears in your eyes?

530
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,113
What is this?

531
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,279
Such a strong girl is crying?

532
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:12,459
We tried, but we didn't succeed.

533
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:13,961
So what?

534
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:16,122
We will try again.

535
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,962
Never consider yourself
to be alone.

536
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,127
I will always be with you.

537
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:24,304
We will be with you at every step.

538
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,309
Now come on, cheer up.

539
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:44,484
Raj, why does God do this with us?

540
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,325
He gives us happiness for a moment..

541
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:55,164
..and then he snatches
all of it. Why?

542
00:49:55,892 --> 00:50:00,341
Sia, if you think that
this is a defeat..

543
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:03,844
..how will we take care of Ria?
- Then..

544
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,848
What should I do? You tell
me. What should I do?

545
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:10,350
What will happen to Ria, Raj?

546
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,251
Everything will be all right.

547
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,867
Ria madam.

548
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,199
This is my marriage invitation card.

549
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,865
Please come to my marriage.

550
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,874
I will be very happy.

551
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,933
Thank you.

552
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,994
How many times have I told you?

553
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,327
I need some difference between..

554
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:32,924
..this sample and this sample.

555
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,263
What will I do of all this now?

556
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:36,201
There aren't any buyers
to buy all this.

557
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,261
You didn't understand even when
I told you so many times?

558
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:40,001
Madam.
- What is it?

559
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,599
Madam.
- What?

560
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:42,939
Ria madam wants to go
to America alone..

561
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,536
..for the Richmond Global meeting.

562
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:47,072
What?

563
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,614
What is this? Why did you decide
to go to America alone?

564
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:03,126
Yes. I know that is important
for one of us to be here.

565
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,291
But Ria, you have been
operated recently.

566
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,629
You need rest.

567
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,136
You cannot go so far all alone.

568
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,968
And as it is, I can handle the
clients better than you.

569
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,307
ls what you say always right?

570
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,041
If one of us goes to America,
that is me.

571
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,481
And this decision is
final. All right?

572
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,057
What are you thinking about, Sia?

573
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,005
Just like that.

574
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:49,009
I have never Ria all alone
for so many clays.

575
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:52,171
Ria has grown up now, Sia.

576
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,511
She can take care of herself.

577
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,175
I know.

578
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,515
But who will tell this to my heart?

579
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,681
And then, even I am there
to take care of her.

580
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,423
That's really sweet.

581
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:08,520
But you cannot be with her for
twenty four hours to look after her.

582
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,088
Yes. This is correct.

583
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,197
But I have one solution.

584
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,036
What?

585
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,773
If you want then..

586
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,654
Oh God! Ria! I am so excited.

587
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,563
Come on, come on, quickly. Let's go!

588
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,494
Come on, Ria. Hurry up.

589
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,659
What has happened to Ria?

590
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,786
She seems like a extinguished light.

591
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:51,631
We decided about marriage
all of a sudden.

592
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,793
Maybe she is upset because of that.

593
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,803
Please come.. please
come.. Ms. Sia..

594
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,637
Sister-in-law".

595
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,537
Congratulations.

596
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,136
Thank you.

597
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,149
Ria..

598
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,211
I know that you are angry with me..

599
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,417
..because I took this decision
without asking you.

600
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,660
But please try and understand.

601
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,891
I am leaving you alone
for fifteen days.

602
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,166
During this time, there should be..

603
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,169
..someone with you, who
we can call our own.

604
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:31,762
Whom we trust fully.

605
00:55:32,228 --> 00:55:35,437
And after the marriage, Raj
becomes our family member.

606
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,679
As soon as I go, Raj
will take a holiday..

607
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,340
..from his office and
he will stay with you.

608
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,515
Ria, you understand what I say?

609
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:49,455
I know that you wanted to hold
our marriage in a grand way.

610
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:53,517
But please don't be angry now. And
sign this nuptials certificate.

611
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,585
Please?

612
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,763
My beloved went away from me.

613
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:13,273
This heart was so helpless.

614
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:16,469
Who will rejoin this heart?

615
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,605
The mirror which has been broken.

616
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:25,449
Now, we keep searching pieces..

617
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:28,955
Now, we keep searching pieces.

618
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:33,961
What is this that we have done?

619
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:41,560
We have lost our beloved.

620
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,123
Congrats! Meet my husband.

621
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,716
Hello!

622
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:17,731
We missed you in our wedding
function but you didn't turn up.

623
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,731
Madam, you too should marry now.

624
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,899
Thank you.

625
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,737
How are you?

626
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,739
Hey, hi!

627
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:38,149
Oh, you make a great couple.
You look gorgeous.

628
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,414
And he is looking great, isn't it?

629
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,752
Hello, everybody. How are you?
- Hi!

630
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:46,589
Nice party, man. Can you come out
for a moment, please? - Excuse me.

631
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,824
Listen something!

632
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,427
Raj!
- Hi! - Hello!

633
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,768
Isn't she going to the US..

634
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,603
..tomorrow for 15 days?
- Yes, but..

635
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:07,043
My dear, today is your golden night.

636
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,779
And half of it is over.

637
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,781
Stop spreading fake
smiles over here..

638
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,618
..take her along and
go home. Get along.

639
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,788
I wouldn't mind, but..

640
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,621
..what will happen to these guests?

641
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,459
I will handle the show
and then Ria is also there.

642
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,125
I am moving.. take care, ok?
- Yeah, sure.

643
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:27,967
Hi!

644
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:32,972
How is wife?

645
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,478
Brother..
- Yes.

646
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:43,642
Can see Raj and Sia anywhere?

647
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:48,488
Brother, Raj and Sia didn't marry..

648
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:51,150
..just to offer your food and drinks.

649
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:54,994
But where are they, by the way?

650
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,657
Gone to play the Dandiya.

651
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,899
Dandiya? Over here?

652
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:07,169
Friend like you wouldn't have
allowed them to play anything.

653
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:11,511
So they escaped! Escaped.

654
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:42,867
Teach me to live!

655
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:50,039
Teach me to live my
life to the fullest!

656
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:55,554
I am incomplete since years.

657
01:01:55,611 --> 01:02:02,221
Make me complete, please.

658
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:11,900
Teach me to live.

659
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:19,980
Fulfill my life.

660
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:46,657
Let the lips lock each other.

661
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:01,773
Let the breaths mingle.

662
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:12,796
Let the lips lock each other.

663
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:17,964
Let the breaths mingle.

664
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:24,639
Take me in your embrace..

665
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:31,242
..and let us forget the world.

666
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:41,058
Teach me to live.

667
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:49,067
Fulfill my wishes.

668
01:04:51,888 --> 01:05:01,741
Let the bodies melt and unite.

669
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:17,751
Let the electrifying
sensations run through the veins.

670
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:22,922
Let the bodies melt and unite.

671
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:28,094
Let the electrifying
sensations run through the veins.

672
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:33,764
I have been in deep slumber..

673
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:41,270
..wake me with your soft touch.

674
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:50,449
Teach me to live.

675
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:58,395
Fulfill my life.

676
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,319
Ria!

677
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:30,329
Raj!

678
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:00,852
Raj!

679
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,931
Raj!

680
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,877
You are lucky.

681
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:22,040
It could have been fatal otherwise.

682
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:25,047
Don't worry.

683
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:29,286
He would be fine now.

684
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:33,890
He has to just wait for 24 hours.

685
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,087
Thank you, doctor.

686
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,061
Thank you, doctor.

687
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,407
How can you be so careless?

688
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,314
And stubborn?

689
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:01,318
What could have happened,
had Raj been not there?

690
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:05,257
And by the way what the hell were..

691
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:07,123
..you doing there, at midnight?

692
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,929
Forget it.

693
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,987
Ria wouldn't have done it on purpose.

694
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:14,534
How to forget it?

695
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,126
I have a flight tomorrow morning..

696
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:18,433
..and how can I go
under such circumstances?

697
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:21,134
lam not going.

698
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:22,938
I will get my tickets cancelled,
right away.

699
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,000
How can you do that?

700
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:27,445
Ria and I will take
care of each other.

701
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,281
We cannot wait such
a great opportunity.

702
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,115
Just concentrate on your work.

703
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,680
We will be waiting for you.

704
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,125
Cheer her up!

705
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,963
I am sorry.

706
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,722
Ria, take care of yourself..

707
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,318
..and also Raj's.

708
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,496
I love and I will miss you.

709
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,343
Your wife loves you a lot!

710
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,605
Yes, sister.

711
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,011
Had I not forced her to go..

712
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:36,208
..she would have missed the flight
for this love and miss you stuff.

713
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:41,687
Ok. Take care.
- Thank you, sister.

714
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:53,032
Has Sia gone?

715
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:09,048
Don't worry, Ria, I am ok.

716
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,207
Come on, Ria.

717
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:16,222
You were not at fault.

718
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:20,252
No use thinking about it. I am ok.

719
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,065
I am 0k, Ria.

720
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,394
Ria, I am fine.

721
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:35,066
Please don't bother.

722
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,233
I am 0k, Ria.

723
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,135
I said, I am fine, Ria.

724
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:44,811
Ria, it's 0k, I am alright, Ria.

725
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:53,422
Hi, doctor!

726
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:56,425
Hello! How are you feeling?
- Better.

727
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:59,295
You are ok now.

728
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,164
You can go home in the evening.

729
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:04,761
But take care of your arm.

730
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,829
Fine, doctor.
- Ok? - Yeah.

731
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,509
What?
- Nothing, doctor.

732
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:14,775
She is asking what
time can she take me home?

733
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,774
But don't bother. I
will come home myself.

734
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,841
It's ok.

735
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:22,644
You are a lucky man.
You have a good wife.

736
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:25,385
And a good sister-in-law.

737
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:29,128
Thank you, doctor.
She is very caring.

738
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:32,187
She is a great girl.

739
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,274
Ria?

740
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,336
You don't know to swim?

741
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,286
I will teach you. Come on.

742
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:08,616
It is very easy, Ria.

743
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,953
I will hold your hands and
you start moving your legs.

744
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,458
Yeah, like that.

745
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,290
lam letting go of your hands.

746
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,830
Nothing to worry. Come on.

747
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:21,690
Just try, Ria.

748
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:24,299
You can swim, Ria.

749
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,965
Come on.

750
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,507
Yeah. You can swim.

751
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:36,375
I am going to the market.

752
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,370
You want to come?

753
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:52,734
Here, take your purse, Ria.

754
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:54,025
Hello?
- Hello, Raj.

755
01:20:54,081 --> 01:20:56,027
Hi, Sia. How are you?

756
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:58,689
lam all right. How are you?
How is your hand?

757
01:20:59,086 --> 01:21:00,292
It is better now.

758
01:21:00,354 --> 01:21:01,492
And I miss you, you know.

759
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:03,558
I know, I miss you too. How is Ria?

760
01:21:03,624 --> 01:21:05,035
She is taking care of you, isn't it?

761
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:10,032
More than needed.

762
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:12,636
What do you mean?

763
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:15,647
She doesn't leave me alone. She
clings to me like a shadow.

764
01:21:16,103 --> 01:21:17,446
She is all right, isn't it, Raj?

765
01:21:18,105 --> 01:21:20,107
She is all right, she is all right.

766
01:21:21,108 --> 01:21:24,453
You know how Ria is. She does
everything to the extreme.

767
01:21:24,645 --> 01:21:26,056
But she only cares for you.

768
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:33,655
That is all right. But nobody
can take your place.

769
01:21:36,123 --> 01:21:38,535
None can replace you. Come soon.

770
01:21:39,126 --> 01:21:42,403
I will come back soon. You take
care of yourself, okay?

771
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,073
Miss you a lot.

772
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:45,337
Bye.

773
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:46,571
Take care.

774
01:22:35,182 --> 01:22:37,128
I am sensual..

775
01:22:40,254 --> 01:22:42,461
Sensual love..

776
01:22:54,201 --> 01:22:56,203
I am a sensual..

777
01:22:59,206 --> 01:23:01,208
I am a sensual..

778
01:23:03,744 --> 01:23:05,746
lam a real..

779
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:18,159
Feel me, touch me I am
holding the moment.

780
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:27,303
Feel me, touch me I am
holding the moment.

781
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,477
Look, Ria.

782
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:06,273
I don't know what is going
on in your mind.

783
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:08,809
But you stop taking care
of me and my things.

784
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:11,812
I can take care of them myself.

785
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:13,417
Understand?

786
01:26:57,444 --> 01:27:00,050
What do you want? I should
sleep with you?

787
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:02,384
I should take you to bed with me?

788
01:27:02,449 --> 01:27:04,395
Do everything that you want to?

789
01:27:04,451 --> 01:27:05,725
I can do all of that.

790
01:27:05,986 --> 01:27:08,057
But I am not an insolent like you.

791
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:11,062
I can do whatever you want all day.

792
01:27:11,892 --> 01:27:13,394
But I respect relations.

793
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:17,067
You are just Sia's sister
for me. Nothing else.

794
01:27:17,998 --> 01:27:20,069
That sister who loves
you more than her life.

795
01:27:21,068 --> 01:27:22,411
How many times did I try to make..

796
01:27:22,469 --> 01:27:23,607
..you understand, directly
and indirectly.

797
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:25,412
But you don't understand at all.

798
01:27:26,607 --> 01:27:29,588
You can betray Sia, not me.

799
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:33,822
Do you know why? Because
I love Sia.

800
01:27:34,481 --> 01:27:35,960
I don't love you.

801
01:27:36,016 --> 01:27:38,018
If you cannot hear it,
repeat it and see.

802
01:27:38,085 --> 01:27:39,428
I don't love you.

803
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:45,561
Now Sia will decide
what she has to do.

804
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:48,100
But I am going to leave
this house right now.

805
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:49,635
ls that clear?

806
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,480
You want to say, that
if I leave this house..

807
01:28:28,535 --> 01:28:30,537
..you will kill yourself?

808
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:36,552
Whether you die or live.. I
am not concerned with this.

809
01:28:38,145 --> 01:28:40,625
Go to hell. And I am
leaving this house.

810
01:29:02,703 --> 01:29:04,910
What do you do, Ria?
You are really crazy.

811
01:29:46,613 --> 01:29:48,559
I cannot understand what to do.

812
01:29:48,615 --> 01:29:51,152
What is there to think about that?

813
01:29:51,618 --> 01:29:54,895
Do whatever she wants to.
She looks like Sia.

814
01:29:54,955 --> 01:29:56,957
She is beautiful. Enjoy.

815
01:29:57,758 --> 01:29:59,897
There cannot be anyone
luckier than you.

816
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:03,573
You have got an item
in the discount sale of life.

817
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:05,576
One
free with another.

818
01:30:05,632 --> 01:30:07,634
This isn't anything to
laugh about, Sameer.

819
01:30:07,968 --> 01:30:09,572
This is very serious.

820
01:30:10,237 --> 01:30:12,046
You know that I cannot do like this.

821
01:30:12,106 --> 01:30:13,585
But why can't you do like this?

822
01:30:14,241 --> 01:30:15,584
See.

823
01:30:15,642 --> 01:30:17,588
Two swords cannot exist
in one scabbard..

824
01:30:17,644 --> 01:30:19,590
..we all have heard this.
But one sword..

825
01:30:19,646 --> 01:30:22,650
..can exist in two scabbards,
isn't it, brother?

826
01:30:23,183 --> 01:30:25,185
One by one..

827
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:26,595
Are you mad?

828
01:30:27,187 --> 01:30:30,100
Sia is my wife. I love
her and not Ria.

829
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:33,595
She is mad.

830
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:35,597
She is a monster.

831
01:30:36,096 --> 01:30:37,598
How can I tell it to you?

832
01:30:38,198 --> 01:30:39,609
I am trapped badly.

833
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,808
Just a minute, what do
you mean by trapped?

834
01:30:43,937 --> 01:30:48,886
If the matter is so serious,
why are you staying here?

835
01:30:50,077 --> 01:30:52,023
Don't live her. Just
leave this house.

836
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:55,686
I tried this last night,
but she cut her wrists.

837
01:30:56,216 --> 01:30:57,957
What?
- Yes, Sunil.

838
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:01,631
Think that..

839
01:31:01,822 --> 01:31:03,631
Ria is made such a boundary
with her blood..

840
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:05,101
..that cannot be crossed by me.

841
01:31:05,692 --> 01:31:09,640
Oh! You mean, Ria's boundary.
Just like Laksmana's boundary.

842
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,766
Sameer.

843
01:31:10,831 --> 01:31:12,640
No, I was telling you, if you
want to leave this house..

844
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:14,701
"Leave it, how are you
concerned with it?

845
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:17,171
After that, if she wishes
to cut her wrists, let her.

846
01:31:17,237 --> 01:31:18,648
Let he die if she wants to.

847
01:31:18,705 --> 01:31:21,311
If she commits suicide,
how are you guilty?

848
01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:24,120
Just leave this house.

849
01:31:24,178 --> 01:31:25,657
Let her be.

850
01:31:25,846 --> 01:31:27,655
And what answer shall I give to Sia?

851
01:31:29,249 --> 01:31:30,660
What shall I tell her?

852
01:31:31,718 --> 01:31:33,994
I promised her that I will
take care of her sister.

853
01:31:35,322 --> 01:31:39,737
If this mad girl does something,
I won't be able to face her.

854
01:31:42,729 --> 01:31:44,675
She will never forgive me.

855
01:31:48,268 --> 01:31:50,339
You problem is really very serious.

856
01:31:53,273 --> 01:31:54,684
You are trapped. You
are really trapped.

857
01:31:56,009 --> 01:31:57,181
What will you do now?

858
01:31:58,212 --> 01:31:59,691
I will wait for Sia.

859
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:04,219
Hello..
- Hi, Raj.

860
01:32:04,284 --> 01:32:06,286
Sia.. how are you?

861
01:32:06,353 --> 01:32:09,095
I am fine.
- I was speaking to Sunil about you.

862
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:12,035
We have got a huge contract
from Marks and Spencer.

863
01:32:12,759 --> 01:32:14,705
That's so good. I am
really happy for you.

864
01:32:14,761 --> 01:32:16,707
What is the matter, Raj?
You don't seem happy.

865
01:32:16,763 --> 01:32:18,709
I am very happy, Sia. Very happy.

866
01:32:18,765 --> 01:32:21,712
But what_ I will tell yoq now,
you wlll jLllTlp with joy.

867
01:32:21,768 --> 01:32:24,840
Guess.
- I cannot, tell me.

868
01:32:24,905 --> 01:32:26,714
lam coming by the four
o clock flight today.

869
01:32:26,773 --> 01:32:27,911
You will come at the airport,
isn't it?

870
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:30,785
Of course, Ria. I will
see you at the airport. - Bye.

871
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:35,392
All passengers going by flight 18..

872
01:32:58,338 --> 01:33:00,340
Raj..
- Hey, Sia..

873
01:33:07,347 --> 01:33:08,758
How are you, Sia?

874
01:33:08,815 --> 01:33:11,295
lam all right, how are you?
- All right.

875
01:33:12,085 --> 01:33:14,087
I missed you a lot.
- I missed you too.

876
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:18,293
Sorry, I am late, thanks
to Bombay traffic.

877
01:33:18,358 --> 01:33:20,838
Doesn't matter. Shall we move now?
- Yes.

878
01:33:29,836 --> 01:33:31,110
I missed you, Raj.

879
01:33:31,838 --> 01:33:33,112
Missed you too, Sia.

880
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,979
What is the matter?
You seem very tensed?

881
01:33:36,910 --> 01:33:40,119
No, Sia. You love your sister
very much, isn't it?

882
01:33:41,848 --> 01:33:43,794
What kind of question is this, Raj?

883
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:47,127
When you weren't in my life,
she was my life.

884
01:33:47,854 --> 01:33:50,460
And now, both of you are my life.

885
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:54,000
Actually, Sia isn't
how she seems to be.

886
01:33:55,862 --> 01:33:58,001
ls it? Then how is she?

887
01:33:58,465 --> 01:34:00,809
You won't believe me if I tell you..

888
01:34:00,867 --> 01:34:04,405
..but ever since you have gone,
the way she looks at me.

889
01:34:05,472 --> 01:34:06,815
It's not normal.

890
01:34:07,407 --> 01:34:11,287
Raj, she is only trying to care.

891
01:34:11,545 --> 01:34:13,491
She is just trying to
take care of you.

892
01:34:14,214 --> 01:34:15,818
And you know that she
doesn't understand..

893
01:34:15,882 --> 01:34:18,328
..what one says if they don't
have a lip or body movement?

894
01:34:18,885 --> 01:34:21,365
Then how will she understand
what you say?

895
01:34:22,022 --> 01:34:24,229
I had explained it to you before
I left too, isn't it?

896
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:25,827
How can I make you understand?

897
01:34:26,326 --> 01:34:27,964
You don't need to tell me anything.

898
01:34:28,028 --> 01:34:30,508
I know that it is difficult
to stay with my sister.

899
01:34:30,897 --> 01:34:32,843
But if you stay with
her for some days..

900
01:34:32,899 --> 01:34:35,243
..you will understand everything
all by itself.

901
01:34:35,902 --> 01:34:37,040
But Sia..

902
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:41,450
Now, Raj. You don't need to worry.
I have come, isn't it?

903
01:34:41,508 --> 01:34:42,851
And then.. we will not talk
anything about Ria.

904
01:34:42,909 --> 01:34:44,115
we have met after so many days..

905
01:34:44,177 --> 01:34:45,850
..and you are speaking about Ria?

906
01:34:46,513 --> 01:34:48,254
We will forget ourselves
amongst ourselves.

907
01:34:50,917 --> 01:34:53,193
The sinking what I am
telling you about.

908
01:35:12,472 --> 01:35:15,885
The beloved".

909
01:35:15,942 --> 01:35:17,888
Me..

910
01:35:17,944 --> 01:35:22,552
Both of us, didn't let
each other sleep.

911
01:35:23,383 --> 01:35:26,887
The beloved".

912
01:35:26,953 --> 01:35:28,899
Me..

913
01:35:28,955 --> 01:35:34,234
Both of us, didn't let
each other sleep.

914
01:35:34,961 --> 01:35:40,377
We just loved".

915
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:44,439
We just loved".

916
01:35:44,504 --> 01:35:50,580
Love didn't let us sleep.

917
01:35:51,111 --> 01:35:54,456
The beloved".

918
01:35:54,514 --> 01:35:55,925
Me..

919
01:35:55,982 --> 01:36:02,092
Both of us, didn't let
each other sleep.

920
01:36:30,016 --> 01:36:35,016
The rhythm of her bangles,
her glittering ‘bindiya’.

921
01:36:41,027 --> 01:36:46,027
The rhythm of her bangles,
her glittering ‘bindiya’.

922
01:36:52,038 --> 01:36:57,038
Her gaze didn't let me sleep.

923
01:37:03,049 --> 01:37:09,000
We just loved".

924
01:37:09,055 --> 01:37:13,003
We just loved".

925
01:37:13,059 --> 01:37:19,340
Love didn't let us sleep.

926
01:37:58,638 --> 01:38:03,638
Her attitudes.. have
wrecked havoc..

927
01:38:09,249 --> 01:38:14,249
Her attitudes.. have
wrecked havoc..

928
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:25,460
The speed of my heartbeats
didn't let us sleep.

929
01:38:31,471 --> 01:38:37,080
We just loved".

930
01:38:37,143 --> 01:38:41,091
We just loved".

931
01:38:41,147 --> 01:38:47,757
Love didn't let us sleep.

932
01:38:48,154 --> 01:38:51,101
The beloved".

933
01:38:51,157 --> 01:38:53,103
Me..

934
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:58,768
We didn't let each other sleep.

935
01:38:59,165 --> 01:39:02,112
The beloved".

936
01:39:02,168 --> 01:39:04,114
Me..

937
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:09,518
We didn't let each other sleep.

938
01:39:28,194 --> 01:39:29,332
Raj"

939
01:39:32,799 --> 01:39:34,142
Want more? - No.

940
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,338
Apples"

941
01:39:38,738 --> 01:39:40,149
Raj"

942
01:39:42,475 --> 01:39:43,647
Hey"

943
01:39:46,813 --> 01:39:48,156
Raj"

944
01:39:52,752 --> 01:39:54,163
How much do you love me?

945
01:39:56,823 --> 01:39:58,825
As much as the lashes love the eye.

946
01:39:59,225 --> 01:40:00,363
I didn't understand.

947
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:04,230
This is what I am sad about. You
didn't understand my love.

948
01:40:04,764 --> 01:40:06,175
What?

949
01:40:06,232 --> 01:40:07,302
You fool.

950
01:40:07,367 --> 01:40:09,176
If the eyes are even
in a bit of pain..

951
01:40:09,235 --> 01:40:11,181
..the lashes come over
them immediately.

952
01:40:11,237 --> 01:40:12,716
Just like my love is.

953
01:40:13,239 --> 01:40:15,515
I don't want anyone to come near me.

954
01:40:18,778 --> 01:40:20,849
I want to be so close to you..

955
01:40:21,247 --> 01:40:23,193
That even air shouldn't
come between us.

956
01:40:23,249 --> 01:40:25,195
But this is impossible.

957
01:40:25,251 --> 01:40:27,197
No, nothing is impossible in love.

958
01:40:27,253 --> 01:40:29,733
No, you are impossible.

959
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:32,194
Do you think that what
I say is funny?

960
01:40:32,258 --> 01:40:34,260
Come on. I will not talk to you.

961
01:40:44,804 --> 01:40:46,681
Till today, I didn't understand..

962
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:49,220
When the beautiful
people get angry..

963
01:40:49,275 --> 01:40:51,221
..why do they seem more beautiful?

964
01:40:51,277 --> 01:40:53,757
You don't need to butter me.
I am angry with you now.

965
01:40:54,681 --> 01:40:59,221
Let me see what is the
taste of angry lips?

966
01:41:18,304 --> 01:41:20,306
Here.. your loved sister has come.

967
01:41:21,641 --> 01:41:22,779
Ask her.

968
01:41:22,842 --> 01:41:25,413
Why is she so sad looking
at us happy together?

969
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:29,750
Why has she tears in her eyes?

970
01:41:33,853 --> 01:41:36,766
Because I didn't think that
you will be such a person.

971
01:41:38,324 --> 01:41:39,598
She is speaking..

972
01:41:39,793 --> 01:41:41,272
Sia..

973
01:42:00,947 --> 01:42:02,290
Ria..

974
01:42:02,882 --> 01:42:04,293
So you are Ria?

975
01:42:11,891 --> 01:42:14,428
You betrayed me. I must tell you.

976
01:42:14,761 --> 01:42:16,297
You are a big liar.

977
01:42:16,496 --> 01:42:18,305
Mind your language, Raj.

978
01:42:18,898 --> 01:42:21,310
It won't be good if you tell
anything to my sister.

979
01:42:21,901 --> 01:42:26,475
Sia.. Sia.. listen to me.

980
01:42:26,906 --> 01:42:28,977
Your sister is not deaf and dumb.

981
01:42:29,642 --> 01:42:35,649
She can speak and listen. Her
operation has been successful.

982
01:42:37,383 --> 01:42:39,659
But she never let
her voice come out.

983
01:42:40,386 --> 01:42:42,866
Sia, please believe me.

984
01:42:43,823 --> 01:42:46,326
Ever since you left, she
has been after me.

985
01:42:46,392 --> 01:42:47,666
And when I didn't agree
to what she said..

986
01:42:47,727 --> 01:42:49,331
..she presented herself
to me as Sia.

987
01:42:49,796 --> 01:42:51,867
She called me. She met
me at the airport.

988
01:42:52,398 --> 01:42:54,400
And since then, she has
been speaking to me.

989
01:42:54,667 --> 01:42:57,409
Now she was telling me..
Raj with out you..

990
01:42:57,937 --> 01:43:01,680
Why don't you speak now? Speak..

991
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:03,947
Sia, she is staging a drama.

992
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:06,684
Shut up, Raj. You are the
one who is staging a drama.

993
01:43:06,746 --> 01:43:08,350
You are making false stories.

994
01:43:08,414 --> 01:43:10,826
But your truth has been unveiled.

995
01:43:11,951 --> 01:43:14,363
Now, I know that since the
beginning till today..

996
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:18,368
..you had an eye on my sister.
So that you could take..

997
01:43:18,424 --> 01:43:22,702
..advantage of her helplessness
in my absence.

998
01:43:22,962 --> 01:43:25,374
Therefore, you were
so upset that day..

999
01:43:25,431 --> 01:43:28,037
..when I spoke of canceling
my ticket in the hospital.

1000
01:43:28,868 --> 01:43:31,041
But now I understand
every little thing.

1001
01:43:31,771 --> 01:43:33,773
I know you since a few days.

1002
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:37,378
I don't know my sister
from childhood".

1003
01:43:37,443 --> 01:43:41,516
..but I know her since
my mother's womb.

1004
01:43:42,982 --> 01:43:46,862
She cannot think or
do anything wrong.

1005
01:43:49,055 --> 01:43:52,400
Don't falsely accuse my sister
to veil your mistakes.

1006
01:43:52,926 --> 01:43:54,405
I committed a huge mistake.

1007
01:43:54,994 --> 01:43:57,565
I committed a huge mistake
in recognizing you.

1008
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:00,410
What I took you to be, and
what you have turned out. - Sia..

1009
01:44:00,466 --> 01:44:02,002
Don't touch me, Raj.

1010
01:44:02,468 --> 01:44:05,005
It is good that I found
out the truth now.

1011
01:44:05,471 --> 01:44:07,542
Or else, I would have a lot
of sadness further in life.

1012
01:44:10,076 --> 01:44:11,749
And thank you very much.

1013
01:44:11,811 --> 01:44:14,018
You looked after my
sister very nicely.

1014
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,423
Sia..

1015
01:44:16,015 --> 01:44:17,426
Come on, Ria.

1016
01:45:53,012 --> 01:45:54,116
You..

1017
01:45:54,180 --> 01:45:55,853
You turned my life into a hell.

1018
01:45:56,115 --> 01:45:57,526
You created such a
wall of suspicion..

1019
01:45:57,583 --> 01:46:01,190
..between me and Sia, that
she left me forever.

1020
01:46:01,587 --> 01:46:03,123
This is what I wanted, Raj.

1021
01:46:03,189 --> 01:46:05,135
You spoke now, isn't it?
You spoke now, isn't it?

1022
01:46:05,191 --> 01:46:07,068
Then why didn't you speak
in front of Sia?

1023
01:46:07,126 --> 01:46:08,935
Because I am not a fool.

1024
01:46:08,995 --> 01:46:10,531
What kind of a woman are you?

1025
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:12,541
The sister who loves you so much..

1026
01:46:12,598 --> 01:46:14,544
..who has yearned to listen
to your voice..

1027
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,012
..who is ready to leave
her husband for you..

1028
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:19,072
..you are playing this game
with such a sister?

1029
01:46:19,605 --> 01:46:21,551
What do you want after all?

1030
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:26,751
You..

1031
01:46:27,613 --> 01:46:28,751
Only you.

1032
01:46:28,815 --> 01:46:30,954
This will not happen, this
will not happen ever.

1033
01:46:31,617 --> 01:46:34,154
I hate you and will
continue to do so, always.

1034
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:36,156
And I am telling you
for the last time.

1035
01:46:36,222 --> 01:46:39,965
Stop playing with my personal
life. Stop it.

1036
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:41,570
What will you do?

1037
01:46:42,095 --> 01:46:43,574
I will kill you.

1038
01:46:43,629 --> 01:46:46,735
If you don't tell the truth
to Sia, I will kill you.

1039
01:46:47,233 --> 01:46:50,737
I warn you, I will kill
you. And mind it.

1040
01:47:03,182 --> 01:47:04,593
Raj"

1041
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:06,596
Actually, we normal people..

1042
01:47:06,652 --> 01:47:08,131
Have a special kind of energy.

1043
01:47:08,187 --> 01:47:11,930
We use it by speaking and listening.

1044
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:14,601
And these deaf and dumb people..

1045
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,662
..have this energy captivated
in themselves.

1046
01:47:17,196 --> 01:47:18,607
And when this energy comes out..

1047
01:47:18,664 --> 01:47:21,270
..it either comes out as
a positive or a negative.

1048
01:47:22,135 --> 01:47:25,207
In Ria's case, this energy has
taken a negative direction.

1049
01:47:26,005 --> 01:47:27,609
And this is very dangerous.

1050
01:47:28,674 --> 01:47:30,676
She will get you under
any circumstances.

1051
01:47:31,210 --> 01:47:33,281
From whom? From her own sister?

1052
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:34,817
Yes.

1053
01:47:35,081 --> 01:47:38,221
Because she has stopped
seeing Sia as her sister.

1054
01:47:39,152 --> 01:47:42,224
And Sia is just another
woman in her love.

1055
01:47:43,089 --> 01:47:45,626
And she won't stop
at anything until..

1056
01:47:45,691 --> 01:47:48,103
..she doesn't remove
this other woman.

1057
01:47:48,227 --> 01:47:50,229
And she won't stop at anything.

1058
01:47:50,696 --> 01:47:52,039
Not even her own sister.

1059
01:49:15,715 --> 01:49:16,887
Oh God!

1060
01:49:54,353 --> 01:49:55,764
SIOP"

1061
01:49:57,823 --> 01:49:58,961
Sia..

1062
01:50:04,764 --> 01:50:06,175
Sia..
- Raj..

1063
01:50:06,232 --> 01:50:07,768
Open the car!

1064
01:50:14,106 --> 01:50:15,779
Sia.. open the car!

1065
01:50:18,444 --> 01:50:19,787
Raj"

1066
01:50:20,446 --> 01:50:22,119
Sia.. open the car!

1067
01:50:33,326 --> 01:50:35,328
Raj.. - Open your seat belt. Quickly.

1068
01:51:05,424 --> 01:51:06,835
Are you all right, Sia?

1069
01:51:10,329 --> 01:51:11,831
Listen to me, Sia.

1070
01:51:13,232 --> 01:51:14,836
I know that you are hurt.

1071
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:18,039
But try to understand what I say.

1072
01:51:20,439 --> 01:51:22,441
What seems, isn't always the truth.

1073
01:51:22,908 --> 01:51:27,914
A lot has happened. A lot.
I need some time to think.

1074
01:51:28,447 --> 01:51:29,858
Yes, Sia.

1075
01:51:32,451 --> 01:51:36,263
But listen to me. She is
trying to manipulate you.

1076
01:51:36,922 --> 01:51:38,924
She is behind all this.

1077
01:51:39,258 --> 01:51:40,396
Please, Raj.

1078
01:51:40,459 --> 01:51:42,530
I don't want to repeat
the same thing again.

1079
01:51:42,928 --> 01:51:47,206
Ria is my sister. And
she can't do this.

1080
01:51:47,933 --> 01:51:49,935
She is not capable
of hurting anyone.

1081
01:51:50,336 --> 01:51:52,543
I knew that you will not
believe in what I say.

1082
01:51:53,939 --> 01:51:57,944
But one clay, this truth
will be unveiled.

1083
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:00,084
And then..

1084
01:52:42,455 --> 01:52:43,934
Oh, shit.

1085
01:52:46,992 --> 01:52:49,529
Oh God! I am sorry.
Hope you aren't hurt.

1086
01:52:49,595 --> 01:52:52,007
No, I am fine. I am fine.

1087
01:52:52,331 --> 01:52:53,935
Can I drop you somewhere
if you wish?

1088
01:52:54,333 --> 01:52:57,280
No. I will go. I will go. Thanks.
- I am really very sorry.

1089
01:52:58,003 --> 01:52:59,141
Oh shit.

1090
01:52:59,538 --> 01:53:00,949
Madam, you?

1091
01:53:02,408 --> 01:53:03,944
Didn't you recognize me?

1092
01:53:05,544 --> 01:53:06,955
We haven't met before.

1093
01:53:07,012 --> 01:53:08,958
Of course, I am Raman
Sinha, detective.

1094
01:53:09,014 --> 01:53:10,288
Don't you remember me?

1095
01:53:11,550 --> 01:53:15,362
I think that we haven't met.
I don't know any detective.

1096
01:53:15,554 --> 01:53:17,500
You gave me the sketch of a man.

1097
01:53:17,556 --> 01:53:18,967
You wanted me to search for him.

1098
01:53:19,024 --> 01:53:20,162
Do you remember?

1099
01:53:20,359 --> 01:53:23,499
Man.. sketch.. you must be
under some misconception.

1100
01:53:23,562 --> 01:53:25,508
Because.. We haven't met ever..

1101
01:53:25,564 --> 01:53:27,976
No, madam. You are my first client".

1102
01:53:28,033 --> 01:53:30,570
..who gave me the full amount
before the work was done.

1103
01:53:31,570 --> 01:53:32,981
I really mean..

1104
01:53:33,038 --> 01:53:34,984
If you have some problem, or if
you are committing some mistake..

1105
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:38,385
Because I never needed
a detective till today.

1106
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:39,980
And.. excuse me.

1107
01:53:43,249 --> 01:53:44,387
She speaks too.

1108
01:53:51,323 --> 01:53:52,996
Good morning, madam.

1109
01:53:53,058 --> 01:53:54,162
Hi.

1110
01:53:54,226 --> 01:53:56,172
Someone is waiting for
you in the cabin.

1111
01:53:56,228 --> 01:53:58,071
Thank you.
- Okay.

1112
01:53:59,165 --> 01:54:01,611
Hi. Can I help you?

1113
01:54:02,067 --> 01:54:04,069
Yes, you can.

1114
01:54:09,074 --> 01:54:12,180
I am Wong, special officer
from crime branch.

1115
01:54:12,244 --> 01:54:13,348
Oh.

1116
01:54:13,412 --> 01:54:15,016
Pleased to meet you.

1117
01:54:16,282 --> 01:54:19,229
Have you seen this woman before?

1118
01:54:24,089 --> 01:54:26,035
Yes.

1119
01:54:26,091 --> 01:54:30,039
She used to work in the office
in which my husband used to.

1120
01:54:35,100 --> 01:54:37,706
Can you tell me about this earring?

1121
01:54:42,107 --> 01:54:45,452
This earring is just like
the one I have worn.

1122
01:54:45,511 --> 01:54:47,320
This was given to me by my sister.

1123
01:54:49,114 --> 01:54:51,116
ls there something special, officer?

1124
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:55,120
Where were you on the 5th of August?

1125
01:54:55,187 --> 01:54:58,259
Fifth August? I will see.

1126
01:55:01,126 --> 01:55:03,128
Just a minute.

1127
01:55:05,464 --> 01:55:06,568
Yes.

1128
01:55:06,632 --> 01:55:08,578
I was at the restaurant
of Carlton House.

1129
01:55:08,634 --> 01:55:11,240
With my client, on a dinner meeting.

1130
01:55:11,303 --> 01:55:13,408
I had done this booking myself.

1131
01:55:13,472 --> 01:55:16,078
But what is the matter?

1132
01:55:16,141 --> 01:55:18,417
Why are asking so many questions?

1133
01:55:18,477 --> 01:55:20,582
On the night of the
fifth of August..

1134
01:55:20,646 --> 01:55:23,422
..between ten and twelve,
someone killed Diana.

1135
01:55:23,482 --> 01:55:25,826
We got this earring from her house.

1136
01:55:26,151 --> 01:55:29,098
Can you tell me something
about your sister?

1137
01:55:33,158 --> 01:55:34,364
My sister?

1138
01:55:34,426 --> 01:55:37,100
My sister is deaf
and dumb, officer..

1139
01:55:37,162 --> 01:55:39,608
..and very less she frequents out.

1140
01:55:43,168 --> 01:55:46,843
Look, you cannot leave this
city without informing us.

1141
01:55:47,172 --> 01:55:49,118
If at all you get any information..

1142
01:55:49,174 --> 01:55:53,122
..then do contact us on
this number. - Sure.

1143
01:55:53,178 --> 01:55:55,784
Okay. Bye.
- Good bye.

1144
01:56:21,407 --> 01:56:23,409
I'm Raman Sinha. The detective.

1145
01:56:23,475 --> 01:56:25,352
Don't you remember?

1146
01:56:25,411 --> 01:56:27,652
You gave me the sketch of a boy..

1147
01:56:27,713 --> 01:56:29,158
..and you told me to search him.

1148
01:56:29,214 --> 01:56:31,160
Do you remember now?

1149
01:56:37,423 --> 01:56:40,233
I knew you would never believe me.

1150
01:56:40,292 --> 01:56:42,238
But, my every word is true.

1151
01:56:42,294 --> 01:56:46,174
Someday, the truth will come
out in the open and then..

1152
01:56:48,334 --> 01:56:51,178
I am Wong, special officer
from crime branch, Bangkok.

1153
01:56:51,236 --> 01:56:54,445
Can you tell me something about this?

1154
01:57:29,475 --> 01:57:31,546
So, you've come to know
about everything?

1155
01:57:36,482 --> 01:57:38,223
Ria..

1156
01:57:38,484 --> 01:57:40,555
Ria, you can speak?

1157
01:57:41,553 --> 01:57:44,557
You can really speak?

1158
01:57:45,491 --> 01:57:47,232
For this..

1159
01:57:47,393 --> 01:57:50,897
I waited for this very moment
throughout my life.

1160
01:57:51,563 --> 01:57:53,736
I prayed to Lord day and night..

1161
01:57:53,799 --> 01:57:56,837
..so that he could return
your power of speech.

1162
01:57:57,569 --> 01:58:00,641
And, today since you've
regained that speech..

1163
01:58:00,706 --> 01:58:03,915
..it seems all that joy
is lost somewhere.

1164
01:58:04,576 --> 01:58:07,250
Why did you do all this, Ria?

1165
01:58:07,312 --> 01:58:09,314
What did you wanted?

1166
01:58:09,381 --> 01:58:10,587
Raj?

1167
01:58:10,649 --> 01:58:12,322
You were in love with him, isn't it?

1168
01:58:13,318 --> 01:58:15,525
For once..

1169
01:58:16,321 --> 01:58:19,768
Had you told me for once,
then I would have..

1170
01:58:19,825 --> 01:58:21,930
...myself got away from your path.

1171
01:58:21,994 --> 01:58:23,667
So, what's the problem now?

1172
01:58:23,729 --> 01:58:25,766
You've got into everything now.

1173
01:58:26,532 --> 01:58:27,670
What happened?

1174
01:58:27,733 --> 01:58:29,610
Why did you seal your lips?

1175
01:58:29,668 --> 01:58:33,946
Everyone brags a lot, but the
selfish nature overtakes.

1176
01:58:34,606 --> 01:58:37,280
I've demanded something from
you for the first time..

1177
01:58:37,342 --> 01:58:39,413
..and you've completely gone mum.

1178
01:58:39,478 --> 01:58:41,890
You love a great deal
with me, isn't it?

1179
01:58:42,347 --> 01:58:46,693
Give me back my love that
you snatched away from me.

1180
01:58:46,752 --> 01:58:49,289
Snatched away? And me?

1181
01:58:49,354 --> 01:58:52,494
You've snatched away Raj from me.

1182
01:58:53,358 --> 01:58:56,805
That day on the show, wherein
I saw him for the first time..

1183
01:58:56,862 --> 01:58:58,705
...I fell in love with
him then and there.

1184
01:58:58,764 --> 01:59:00,971
And, I was even searching for him.

1185
01:59:01,033 --> 01:59:02,376
But, you..

1186
01:59:02,434 --> 01:59:05,472
..jumped into my search and my love.

1187
01:59:06,371 --> 01:59:09,318
Do you remember what Raj said
that day at the pool?

1188
01:59:10,375 --> 01:59:13,379
Had he met me before Sia,
then he would have..

1189
01:59:13,445 --> 01:59:15,925
..fallen in love with me
rather than with Sia.

1190
01:59:16,381 --> 01:59:19,328
So, now.. give me back my Raj.

1191
01:59:19,485 --> 01:59:21,931
Ria, how can you give Raj?

1192
01:59:21,987 --> 01:59:23,330
It's very easy.

1193
01:59:23,388 --> 01:59:25,493
From today on.. you become
deaf and dumb..

1194
01:59:25,557 --> 01:59:27,002
..that is, you become Ria.

1195
01:59:27,059 --> 01:59:30,336
And, I'll become Sia and
stay along with Raj.

1196
01:59:30,395 --> 01:59:32,397
Ria, you don't understand anything.

1197
01:59:32,464 --> 01:59:36,002
Raj is not only my love,
but he's also my husband!

1198
01:59:36,068 --> 01:59:37,513
He's my husband!

1199
01:59:37,569 --> 01:59:39,344
And, no woman in the
world will give..

1200
01:59:39,404 --> 01:59:41,350
..her husband to anyone else.

1201
01:59:41,406 --> 01:59:43,852
No matter whether she's
her own blood sister.

1202
01:59:43,909 --> 01:59:45,013
Really?

1203
01:59:45,077 --> 01:59:46,852
How can Raj be your husband?

1204
01:59:46,912 --> 01:59:49,017
He has just got married to you.

1205
01:59:49,081 --> 01:59:52,028
But, he has spent that first
matrimonial night with me.

1206
01:59:52,084 --> 01:59:54,690
Ria, what cheap talk
you're indulging in?

1207
01:59:54,753 --> 01:59:57,859
By cheating someone or
by deceiving someone..

1208
01:59:57,923 --> 01:59:59,698
..it doesn't mean that
you've achieved him!

1209
01:59:59,758 --> 02:00:01,431
Raj loves only me.

1210
02:00:01,493 --> 02:00:03,370
And, we love each other.

1211
02:00:03,428 --> 02:00:05,533
So, better, get away
from between us!

1212
02:00:05,597 --> 02:00:08,373
Shun your insistence and forget Raj!

1213
02:00:21,446 --> 02:00:22,789
I should forget Raj?!

1214
02:00:22,848 --> 02:00:25,055
I should forget to breathe?!

1215
02:00:25,117 --> 02:00:26,721
You mean I should forget to live?!

1216
02:00:26,785 --> 02:00:28,731
You'll tell me what
should I be doing?!

1217
02:00:30,455 --> 02:00:34,562
I can forget myself, but not Raj!

1218
02:00:34,626 --> 02:00:35,798
Did you hear that?!

1219
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:38,398
I cannot forget Raj!

1220
02:00:49,675 --> 02:00:51,416
Sia..

1221
02:00:51,476 --> 02:00:53,683
Hi, Raj.
- Hi.

1222
02:01:00,485 --> 02:01:01,759
Raj, you were right.

1223
02:01:01,820 --> 02:01:03,822
Whatever you said about Ria
was absolutely correct.

1224
02:01:03,889 --> 02:01:05,027
She's gone crazy!

1225
02:01:05,090 --> 02:01:06,933
She's gone mad!

1226
02:01:07,492 --> 02:01:11,440
I'm sorry, Raj, that I didn't
trusted your word..

1227
02:01:11,496 --> 02:01:14,841
..and I didn't trusted my love.

1228
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:18,438
I never knew that my sister
would droop to such a level.

1229
02:01:19,705 --> 02:01:21,446
Forgive me, Raj.

1230
02:01:21,506 --> 02:01:23,452
Listen to me, Raj.

1231
02:01:23,508 --> 02:01:26,717
She deliberately spoiled
our first night.

1232
02:01:26,778 --> 02:01:29,122
And, it was her plan to
send me to America.

1233
02:01:29,181 --> 02:01:31,957
Moreover, it was she who
murdered Diana. - What I?

1234
02:01:32,017 --> 02:01:33,462
Yes.

1235
02:01:33,518 --> 02:01:35,520
But.. where is Ria?

1236
02:01:35,587 --> 02:01:37,624
I somehow avoided her and came here.

1237
02:01:37,689 --> 02:01:40,135
But, she'll definitely come here.

1238
02:01:40,525 --> 02:01:42,471
She can do anything, Raj.

1239
02:01:42,527 --> 02:01:43,870
She'll not let us live.

1240
02:01:43,929 --> 02:01:45,533
We'll leave Bangkok right away.

1241
02:01:45,597 --> 02:01:46,735
C'mon, Raj. Do it fast.

1242
02:01:46,798 --> 02:01:48,072
What are you talking about, Sia?

1243
02:01:48,133 --> 02:01:50,477
Your business is here
and my work is here..

1244
02:01:50,535 --> 02:01:53,744
..how can we leave
everything and go?!

1245
02:01:53,805 --> 02:01:55,478
Moreover, if you've come
to know Ria's reality..

1246
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:56,814
..then what's the problem?

1247
02:01:56,875 --> 02:01:57,979
We'll face her.

1248
02:01:58,043 --> 02:01:59,488
We'll definitely face her.

1249
02:01:59,544 --> 02:02:00,818
No, Raj.

1250
02:02:00,879 --> 02:02:02,825
No matter how evil is my sister..

1251
02:02:02,881 --> 02:02:05,225
"but, I really don't
want to hurt her.

1252
02:02:06,551 --> 02:02:07,996
I've thought a lot about it.

1253
02:02:08,053 --> 02:02:11,660
But, we don't have any way other
than to leave Bangkok.

1254
02:02:11,723 --> 02:02:13,999
And, if we don't stay near her..

1255
02:02:14,059 --> 02:02:16,232
"perhaps, her madness might end.

1256
02:02:17,663 --> 02:02:20,109
Furthermore, she's able
to speak and hear now.

1257
02:02:20,565 --> 02:02:23,239
Maybe, she can start life afresh.

1258
02:02:24,569 --> 02:02:25,843
Now, c'mon.

1259
02:02:25,904 --> 02:02:28,180
I've arranged two tickets
for Australia.

1260
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:30,242
Now, listen to me
and move from here.

1261
02:02:30,575 --> 02:02:32,680
This is the only solution as of now.

1262
02:02:37,783 --> 02:02:42,254
If you really love me,
then come with me.

1263
02:02:42,788 --> 02:02:44,597
Please.

1264
02:02:46,591 --> 02:02:47,865
Fine, Sia.

1265
02:02:47,926 --> 02:02:50,202
You hold on. I'll
be back right away.

1266
02:03:29,634 --> 02:03:31,079
Hello?
- Hello.

1267
02:03:31,136 --> 02:03:32,774
May I speak to Sia?

1268
02:03:32,838 --> 02:03:35,785
No. Madam left the office
two hours back.

1269
02:03:35,841 --> 02:03:38,583
May I know who's speaking?
- Yeah, this is Raj.

1270
02:03:38,744 --> 02:03:40,917
Can I have any message?

1271
02:03:40,979 --> 02:03:42,083
No. thanks.

1272
02:03:42,147 --> 02:03:43,922
Thank you.
- Okay.

1273
02:03:58,663 --> 02:04:01,610
Ra], are you calling me?

1274
02:04:02,868 --> 02:04:05,144
L.. I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

1275
02:04:08,673 --> 02:04:10,619
I'm sorry, Sia. I was trying
to call at the office..

1276
02:04:10,675 --> 02:04:12,621
..but instead I got
connected to you.

1277
02:04:12,677 --> 02:04:15,021
What time is our flight?
- Five o'clock.

1278
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:17,617
Sia, it's already 3:30.

1279
02:04:17,682 --> 02:04:18,956
How can we reach the
airport so fast?

1280
02:04:19,017 --> 02:04:20,291
You know the traffic in Bangkok.

1281
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,956
Don't worry, Raj.

1282
02:04:22,888 --> 02:04:25,300
I've arranged for that as well.

1283
02:04:55,921 --> 02:04:58,197
Ria, pass me that bag.

1284
02:05:15,941 --> 02:05:17,852
What did you say?

1285
02:05:17,909 --> 02:05:19,752
Now matter how hard you try..

1286
02:05:19,811 --> 02:05:22,690
..you can never become Sia.

1287
02:05:24,749 --> 02:05:27,195
Because, no matter how
perfect the mirror is..

1288
02:05:27,252 --> 02:05:29,425
..yet it can't change the reality.

1289
02:05:29,855 --> 02:05:32,699
And, the face verily appears
in the mirror..

1290
02:05:32,757 --> 02:05:35,863
..but whatever that is visible;
is always the other way round.

1291
02:05:36,761 --> 02:05:38,866
That means left is always right
and right is always left.

1292
02:05:40,765 --> 02:05:42,767
You're completely opposite to her.

1293
02:05:42,834 --> 02:05:45,781
And, the moment I saw
this helicopter".

1294
02:05:45,837 --> 02:05:49,876
...I understood that you're
not Sia, but Ria.

1295
02:05:49,941 --> 02:05:51,045
Yes, Raj.

1296
02:05:51,109 --> 02:05:53,214
I'm Ria.

1297
02:05:54,779 --> 02:05:56,725
I love you a lot.

1298
02:05:56,781 --> 02:05:58,783
A lot more than Sia.

1299
02:05:58,850 --> 02:06:01,057
You love Sia, isn't it?

1300
02:06:01,119 --> 02:06:03,725
Then, look. Sia is right
in front of you.

1301
02:06:03,788 --> 02:06:04,926
Sia?

1302
02:06:04,990 --> 02:06:06,731
And, the one who's not
right before you..

1303
02:06:06,791 --> 02:06:08,065
..think of her as Ria.

1304
02:06:09,995 --> 02:06:11,804
Love me Raj.

1305
02:06:13,999 --> 02:06:16,138
I'll shower so much of love on you..

1306
02:06:16,201 --> 02:06:18,909
"which, to date, none might
have ever given to anybody.

1307
02:06:20,071 --> 02:06:23,075
Moreover, I can speak
now and hear now.

1308
02:06:24,242 --> 02:06:26,415
I'm absolutely normal, Raj.

1309
02:06:26,478 --> 02:06:27,923
Enough, Ria!

1310
02:06:27,979 --> 02:06:30,425
You would have understood
had you been normal..

1311
02:06:30,482 --> 02:06:32,155
..that love never happens forcibly!

1312
02:06:32,817 --> 02:06:35,354
You cannot force anyone into love!

1313
02:06:35,820 --> 02:06:38,357
Nevertheless, I love Sia.

1314
02:06:38,423 --> 02:06:40,266
I love Sia!

1315
02:06:41,826 --> 02:06:43,169
Calm down, Raj.

1316
02:06:43,228 --> 02:06:45,265
After all what's your problem?

1317
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:47,970
It's that you're not Sia, but Ria.

1318
02:06:57,108 --> 02:06:59,110
Sia..

1319
02:07:04,849 --> 02:07:06,123
Raj"

1320
02:07:06,184 --> 02:07:08,061
I missed you so much!

1321
02:07:10,121 --> 02:07:13,295
I love you, Raj!
- I love you too, Sia!

1322
02:07:16,194 --> 02:07:18,401
How did all this happen?

1323
02:07:18,863 --> 02:07:20,865
Who did it?

1324
02:07:23,868 --> 02:07:25,814
Ria?

1325
02:07:25,870 --> 02:07:27,816
No, Raj!

1326
02:07:28,873 --> 02:07:30,819
No one can separate us.

1327
02:07:32,077 --> 02:07:34,079
None.

1328
02:08:10,115 --> 02:08:12,186
What do you think of yourself?!

1329
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:17,361
Hey, Why are you hitting her?!
- Hey!

1330
02:08:18,123 --> 02:08:19,932
You leave!

1331
02:08:40,945 --> 02:08:42,947
Sia..

1332
02:08:45,950 --> 02:08:47,952
Are you okay, Sia?

1333
02:08:48,019 --> 02:08:49,293
Sia, tell me!

1334
02:08:49,354 --> 02:08:51,061
Sia, are you okay, Sia?

1335
02:08:51,956 --> 02:08:53,162
Sia!

1336
02:08:53,224 --> 02:08:54,294
Sia!

1337
02:08:54,359 --> 02:08:56,396
Are you okay, Sia?

1338
02:08:56,961 --> 02:08:58,963
Sia, say something.

1339
02:09:26,191 --> 02:09:28,432
If you can never become mine, Raj..

1340
02:09:28,493 --> 02:09:30,939
"then, you can never
become of anyone else.

1341
02:09:30,995 --> 02:09:32,338
None.

1342
02:09:32,397 --> 02:09:34,536
How many times did I
explain you, Raj?!

1343
02:09:34,599 --> 02:09:37,443
How many times did I explain you?!

1344
02:09:37,502 --> 02:09:39,948
I got tired of thqt 'please,
please' thlng!

1345
02:09:45,009 --> 02:09:46,955
Yet, you went to her!

1346
02:09:47,011 --> 02:09:48,957
Why, Raj?!

1347
02:09:52,016 --> 02:09:54,462
Why don't you love me, Raj?!

1348
02:09:54,519 --> 02:09:56,965
Why don't you love me?!

1349
02:09:59,023 --> 02:10:02,368
Why don't you love me, Raj?!

1350
02:10:10,235 --> 02:10:15,708
Raj!

1351
02:10:26,384 --> 02:10:29,593
Ria!

1352
02:10:39,063 --> 02:10:40,167
Ria!

1353
02:10:40,231 --> 02:10:41,335
Ria!

1354
02:10:41,399 --> 02:10:43,504
Ria, give your hand!

1355
02:10:43,568 --> 02:10:46,174
Ral- Raj, pull her up!

1356
02:10:47,071 --> 02:10:48,516
Raj, do something!

1357
02:10:48,573 --> 02:10:50,075
Ria, c'mon!

1358
02:10:50,141 --> 02:10:51,415
Ria, don't lose hope!

1359
02:10:51,476 --> 02:10:52,682
Ria, please!

1360
02:10:52,744 --> 02:10:54,223
Ria, don't leave the hand!

1361
02:10:54,279 --> 02:10:55,417
Ria, we love you!

1362
02:10:56,281 --> 02:10:58,022
Ria, I'll pull you!

1363
02:10:58,082 --> 02:10:59,356
C'mon!

1364
02:10:59,417 --> 02:11:01,021
I love you, Ra]!

1365
02:11:01,085 --> 02:11:04,032
Give me the other hand, Ria!

1366
02:11:06,090 --> 02:11:07,433
Forgive me, Raj!

1367
02:11:07,492 --> 02:11:08,562
Ria! Give me your hand.

1368
02:11:10,094 --> 02:11:11,198
Ria, c'mon!

1369
02:11:11,262 --> 02:11:13,037
Ria, c'mon!

1370
02:11:13,097 --> 02:11:14,371
Raj!

1371
02:11:14,432 --> 02:11:16,036
I love you, Ra]!

1372
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:43,402
Why did the time swing as such?

1373
02:11:45,330 --> 02:11:48,675
Why did the time swing as such?

1374
02:11:48,733 --> 02:11:52,078
Neither I got the beloved,
nor his love.

1375
02:11:52,136 --> 02:11:55,606
The only mistake I committed
was I fell in love.

1376
02:11:55,673 --> 02:11:57,084
Why did I fell in love?

1377
02:11:57,141 --> 02:11:59,587
I was punished since
I fell in love.

1378
02:12:01,145 --> 02:12:11,089
What sort of craze
did I get myself in..

1379
02:12:11,155 --> 02:12:17,765
..it's that I got myself hurt!

1380
02:13:10,815 --> 02:13:14,160
O, boy, listen to my heart.

1381
02:13:16,321 --> 02:13:19,165
I would follow you.

1382
02:13:21,225 --> 02:13:26,504
Let us share our hearts.
And would walk with you.

1383
02:13:26,564 --> 02:13:31,775
You won't find anyone
as beautiful as me.

1384
02:13:31,836 --> 02:13:36,512
You won't find anyone
as beautiful as me.

1385
02:13:37,241 --> 02:13:39,517
Tell me, if at all there's one.

1386
02:14:13,277 --> 02:14:15,223
I'm crazy about you.

1387
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:18,224
So, too the same line with me.

1388
02:14:18,282 --> 02:14:23,231
My heart says it is
in love with you.

1389
02:14:26,290 --> 02:14:28,236
I'm crazy about you.

1390
02:14:28,393 --> 02:14:31,237
So, too the same line with me.

1391
02:14:31,396 --> 02:14:36,243
lam in love with you.

1392
02:14:36,401 --> 02:14:41,578
You won't find anyone
as beautiful as me.

1393
02:14:41,639 --> 02:14:44,245
Tell me, if at all there's one.

1394
02:14:49,313 --> 02:14:52,260
O, boy, listen to my heart.

1395
02:14:55,319 --> 02:14:57,663
I would follow you.

1396
02:15:34,358 --> 02:15:39,637
You traits are unique!
I have gone crazy about them

1397
02:15:39,697 --> 02:15:44,305
O my beloved,
lam in love with you.

1398
02:15:47,371 --> 02:15:52,320
You traits are unique!
I have gone crazy about them

1399
02:15:52,376 --> 02:15:57,325
Come close! Come near me

1400
02:15:57,915 --> 02:16:02,330
You won't find anyone
as beautiful as me.

1401
02:16:02,487 --> 02:16:05,331
Tell me, if at all there's one.

1402
02:16:10,995 --> 02:16:13,669
O, boy, listen to my heart.

1403
02:16:13,831 --> 02:16:16,334
