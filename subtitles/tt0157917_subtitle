1
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
Goal!

2
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,680
Neela!
- I think the injury is serious.

3
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,320
C'mon, Neela.

4
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,600
I don't know what happened to my son.
- Don't worry mother,

5
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,000
..brother will be all right.

6
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Why did he go to watch
the hockey match?

7
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,800
It's his job, he has to go.

8
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,480
And it isn't everyday that you
get hit by a ball, just today.

9
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,720
Is there any internal
injury, Prem?

10
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,240
How am I to know?

11
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,080
I'm a lawyer not a doctor.

12
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,680
I'm sorry! Nurse, the patient
is my brother in law.

13
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
This is the patient's mother and
this is his sister my wife, Suman.

14
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,080
Alok, I mean the patient.
- Wait for some time,

15
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,000
..you'll know everything.

16
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,720
Thank you, nurse.

17
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now please calm down, mother.

18
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Poor Alok, he was
always a weak child.

19
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,080
One day, Alok fell off
from the kitchen roof.

20
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,080
Mother, don't start the same old
story again. - When was this?

21
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,080
They were kids then, we
used to live in Baroda.

22
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Both the siblings were playing
hide and seek on the terrace.

23
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,720
When Suman pushed
Alok off the terrace.

24
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,880
When did I push?

25
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,360
Alok, don't run, I
won't catch you.

26
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,960
Let's go downstairs and play.

27
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
No, I'm a thief. I
know how to jump.

28
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,160
Just like in the movies.

29
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,960
I'll get the umbrella, wait.

30
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,960
Watch me jump.

31
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,440
Hey..

32
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,160
Alok forgot to open the
umbrella while jumping.

33
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,600
Was that my fault?

34
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,120
Tell me something, did
he get hurt anywhere?

35
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,480
He was in the hospital
for 2 months.

36
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,560
He had hurt his backbone.

37
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,400
What was the disease, Suman?

38
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Compressed vertebrae.

39
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,960
Vertebra, the backbone.

40
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,200
Thankfully, doctor Bannerjee,

41
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,440
..whom we knew already. Else..
- Mother!

42
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,200
The backbone.

43
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,120
What's it, Prem?

44
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,200
The plot is now ready.
- What plot?

45
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,480
Just wait and watch.

46
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,280
Are you planning to
trap someone again?

47
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,000
Alok!

48
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,600
Alok, son.

49
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,640
Alok, son.

50
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,200
It's your mother.

51
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,720
Suman and Prem are
here too, have a look.

52
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,120
Son!

53
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,000
How is he?
- Nothing to worry about.

54
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,680
It's a minor wound. We've given
him sleeping pills. Come!

55
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No! I'm.. - He doesn't
even recognize his mother.

56
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,280
Doctor, one minute.

57
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,240
Has he broken any
bones, the backbone?

58
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,120
I don't think so.

59
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
You don't think so! How
long are you practicing?

60
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,360
Since the last 6 months.

61
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,640
Six months, you're
very experienced!

62
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,400
Let's go.

63
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,080
Listen, where are
you taking him?

64
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,120
To the general ward.
- General ward?

65
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,280
He should be kept in
the special room.

66
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
And there should be a
nurse round the clock.

67
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,560
After all, he is my
only brother in law.

68
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,760
Tell the admission
office what you want.

69
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
What you want will be done.
C'mon.

70
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
What's the need for
a special ward?

71
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,840
Where'll we get the money from?

72
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,720
We'll get it. Alok's paper
will give it to us.

73
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,200
Why?

74
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,200
Because Alok's
backbone is injured.

75
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,680
Compressed vertebra!

76
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,480
Will they tear my son apart?

77
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,840
Suman, take mother home.

78
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,320
Aren't you coming? - No.

79
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,000
All right, come early for dinner.
- Why don't you understand?

80
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,920
I'm not only Alok's brother
in law but also his lawyer.

81
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,880
How can I leave him alone
in this condition?

82
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
Leave now. - C'mon, mother.

83
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,720
Good morning! - Good morning!

84
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,520
213962

85
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,480
Midweek?

86
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,480
I'd like to speak to your
chief editor, Mr. Barucha.

87
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Prem Sagar,

88
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,080
I'm your staff photographer
Alok Prakash's brother in law.

89
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,960
Good morning, sir!

90
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm Alok Prakash's
lawyer speaking.

91
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
He is very serious, sir.

92
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,000
His case is getting
very complicated.

93
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,240
It's uncertain whether
he will survive or not.

94
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,600
He is now in Essel hospital
in the special ward.

95
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,280
Yes. It's obvious that you'll
be paying the hospital bills.

96
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,840
But sir, the purpose behind my
call is altogether different.

97
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,760
On behalf of Alok Prakash, I'm
suing your paper for 2 million.

98
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,720
Because this accident took place
during his office duties,

99
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,760
..it's obvious you'll be
paying the compensation.

100
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,120
It was my duty to inform
you hence I've done it.

101
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,080
And I'm going to give this
news to the Indian Times too.

102
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,600
All right then, I'm
in a bit of hurry.

103
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,280
At present Alok's condition is
very serious and so is mine.

104
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,680
Bye.

105
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,480
Hello, please call up Mr.
Rungta. Thank you.

106
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,800
Yes Barucha, who is
this Alok Prakash?

107
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,400
A claim of 2 million! Is he mad?

108
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,160
And look Barucha,

109
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,400
..our paper already has to
fight three defamation cases,

110
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,280
..two court cases,

111
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,640
..the usual government issues
and now this 2 million claim!

112
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,600
I'll close down the
newspaper, Barucha!

113
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,360
Indian Times? It's our enemy.

114
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,840
They'll sensationalize
the story.

115
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,280
I don't want to hear anything.

116
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
I won't give a single penny.

117
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,320
Call up our lawyer, Desai.

118
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,400
It seems Alok Prakash
is going to win.

119
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,960
This time I'm going
to lay such a trap,

120
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,480
..that I'll strike all
the pins down in one go.

121
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,440
Whom are you striking?
Yourself or Alok?

122
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,400
Suman, this is the only
thing that upsets me.

123
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,360
You've still not
understood your husband.

124
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,680
I'll lay a trap for
Midweek newspaper,

125
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,640
..and it's owner Mr. Rungta.

126
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,200
The only thing I'm worried
about is that your brother,

127
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,400
..will spill the beans.

128
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,760
Nothing should happen to Alok.

129
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,360
He's a simple guy.

130
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,400
He's the one who'll get it.
He'll become a millionaire!

131
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,160
Really?

132
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,280
Yes. - How much will he get?

133
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,400
About, 2 million. - 2 million!

134
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,000
And we? - We will get half.

135
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,640
1 million!

136
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,840
Then we'll buy that
sari with golden work,

137
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,480
..which we had seen
at that sari store.

138
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,280
Yes, we'll buy that too.

139
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,320
But first we'll buy a beautiful car.
Imported!

140
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,560
These darn buses and cabs
waste half our time.

141
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,760
And these autos give
you a lot of bumps.

142
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,960
If only Alok keeps
supporting me.

143
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,000
Excuse me.

144
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,080
Yesterday an injured press
photographer was admitted here,

145
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,600
Mr. Alok Prakash. - This isn't
the time to meet patients.

146
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,400
Come in the evening, 4 to 6.

147
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,080
Hello!

148
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,080
I won't be able to come in the
evening. We have a hockey match.

149
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm the captain of
the Gymkhana club.

150
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,960
It was my ball that injured Mr.
Alok.

151
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,360
Hello Kishore!

152
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,280
Go to room number 12 upstairs.
- Thank you!

153
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
You're welcome. - C'mon.

154
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,720
Hello Kishore, listen to me.

155
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm free this evening after 5.

156
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:09,920
Yes.

157
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,120
Look, it says no
visitors allowed.

158
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,280
Let's go back. - Wait. Since
we're here, let's meet him.

159
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,480
We'll sit there. Come, Preeti.

160
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,480
Yes?

161
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,320
Is Mr. Alok Prakash in this room?
- Yes, tell me.

162
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,520
I called up twice yesterday
but I couldn't find anything.

163
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
How is he?
- I can't say anything.

164
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
I've just come in for duty.
He's asleep right now.

165
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,160
Let him sleep then,
I'll wait outside.

166
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,360
Please tell me,
when he wakes up.

167
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
Who was that girl?

168
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,520
She's waiting outside,
go and ask her.

169
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,080
Often on television, one sees
beautiful nurses in the hospital.

170
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,480
Where are those?

171
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,280
Nurse, will you
please go outside?

172
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,000
I want to speak with him alone.

173
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,720
I'm not only his relative
but also his lawyer.

174
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,560
Look.

175
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,800
Take the whole paper with you.
You can read it outside.

176
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,000
How are you, Alok?

177
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,960
How did I get here?

178
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,760
The ambulance and the hospital
stretcher got you here.

179
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,960
God! Why's my head
feeling so heavy?

180
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Just continue lying
down quietly.

181
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,480
There's no need
to get up at all.

182
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:09,640
Where are you going?

183
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,000
To the toilet. - No.

184
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,760
I said keep lying down. You
aren't going anywhere.

185
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,360
Why shouldn't I go anywhere?

186
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,800
Because you've injured your
backbone very seriously.

187
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,120
What? - Yes.

188
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,800
And your left leg
has been paralyzed.

189
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,760
And three fingers of your
right hand are numb.

190
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
What rubbish? My
fingers are fine.

191
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,280
My leg is fine too. Then..
- Shut up.

192
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,920
Ok.

193
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,200
But being just fine would
cause a loss of 2 million.

194
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,800
Whose 2 million?
- Listen to me first.

195
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,480
Alok, after thinking a
lot, I've concluded,

196
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,640
..we won't get such a good
opportunity again in our lives.

197
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,480
Something that would
make us millionaires.

198
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,680
This boss of yours, Mr. Rungta.

199
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,600
2 million for him is a
very measly amount.

200
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,960
He'll give it immediately
to avoid disrepute.

201
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,360
Have you gone mad?

202
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,800
What disrepute? Why would
someone give you 2 million?

203
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,920
What's the harm in trying?
- But what will you try for?

204
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,280
These are all legal matters.
You won't understand.

205
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,600
Ok, you aren't injured.

206
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,120
It isn't important
to get injured,

207
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,520
..but it's important to
prove that you're injured.

208
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,920
Just keep doing as I say.
Everything will be fine.

209
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,720
We just have to prove it.

210
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,320
You move, I've to
go to the toilet.

211
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,400
Why are you taking
so much trouble?

212
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,440
I'll bring the toilet
pot right here.

213
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,600
Prem, why are you doing
such crazy stuff?

214
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,760
Yes, try to remember
everything one more time.

215
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Your backbone is
seriously injured.

216
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,280
Three fingers on your
right hand are numb.

217
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,000
And your left leg doesn't move.

218
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,640
Prem, I don't..
- One more thing.

219
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,800
You should always see double.
- See what?

220
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Double, one as two
and two as four.

221
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,240
How many of me can you see now?
- One, only one.

222
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,000
A shrewd, cheating lawyer
and who's a failure.

223
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
And who's unfortunately
my sister's husband.

224
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,720
Great, amazing thoughts!

225
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,400
And that too for the man,

226
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,320
..who's offering you millions
on a marble platter.

227
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,000
Neither do I want your millions,

228
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,400
..nor your silver platter.

229
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
Brother in law, does
money bite you?

230
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,280
But why do…But why
are you worried?

231
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,960
I have to do everything.

232
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,600
And as soon as the money comes..

233
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,000
This nurse is such a pain.

234
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,200
Good morning, sir.

235
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,800
Good morning. Yes?

236
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,760
Nurse said that Mr. Alok
has woken up, so I..

237
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
Can you read this?

238
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,800
It means no one can meet him.

239
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,960
The patient needs complete rest.

240
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,280
How is he feeling now?

241
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,920
He's very serious.

242
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,000
Give me this bouquet.
I'll give it to him.

243
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,640
What's your name? - Neela.

244
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,560
Do you work in his office? - No.

245
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,200
Actually, it was my ball that
injured him during the match.

246
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,240
I'm the captain of the
Gymkhana hockey club.

247
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,000
I see.

248
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
I think the nurse has
misinformed you.

249
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,480
He's sleeping.

250
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,560
Give me this bouquet,
I'll give it to him.

251
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,960
Never mind, I'll come later.

252
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,000
Tell him that..
- Yes, I'll tell him.

253
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,920
Prem. - Somebody is here!

254
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,960
Where are my clothes? - Why?

255
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,640
I'm leaving. - Where?

256
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Home. - Home!

257
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,800
I think he's very serious.

258
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
They aren't letting me in.
- Let's go then.

259
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,280
I'm feeling very bad.

260
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,720
It's my fault, he is.. - The ball
hit him, how's it your fault.

261
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:42,800
I don't know.

262
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,200
My ball has never hurt anybody.
- He could get better soon too.

263
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,080
And what if he doesn't?

264
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,840
He was saying he's very ill.

265
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,280
Where are my clothes, Prem?

266
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,240
Look, Alok.

267
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,160
Look at present circumstances
and think about them carefully.

268
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,360
First and foremost,
think about Shobha.

269
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,040
Your wife!

270
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,080
Why did she leave you?

271
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,640
Because she wanted a
husband who earned well.

272
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,320
Then your mother.

273
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,000
Suffering from asthma,
blood pressure,

274
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,080
..who works all day just because
she can't afford a servant.

275
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,160
Then take your sister,
I mean my wife.

276
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,800
The poor woman still hasn't
seen a real diamond set.

277
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,640
Ok, on her last birthday,
to please her, I did,

278
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,520
..give her a fake
diamond necklace.

279
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,600
But how long will I keep
giving her false hopes?

280
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,080
Now, your mother, sister, your
two little nephews and me.

281
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,400
All five of us, sleep in one
dingy 10 feet by 12 feet room.

282
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,840
Don't you feel for your mother?

283
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,880
Don't you feel brotherly love?

284
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,760
Don't you feel an uncle's love?

285
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,280
Don't you feel a
brother in law's love?

286
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,800
Do you want us to live all
our lives like insects?

287
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,080
And what do you want? That
I spend my life in jail.

288
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
In my presence?

289
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,800
Let 50 doctors come
and examine you.

290
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,000
If you say once that you've
back pain, it's the final word.

291
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
Even I'm a lawyer.

292
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,160
I'll see which doctor can
prove that you're all right.

293
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,720
Yes, I forgot to tell you
the most important thing.

294
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,160
There'll be no tax charged
on the money we'll get.

295
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,760
But listen.. - Yes, tax free!

296
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,680
The doctor's coming with the X-ray.
Get ready please.

297
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,480
Nurse have you read
the newspaper?

298
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,480
Heard? They're getting an X-ray.

299
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,720
And you were dreaming!

300
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,840
Dear, the injury of
the vertebra is such,

301
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,720
..it's difficult to find out
whether the injury is new,

302
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,960
..else twenty years old.

303
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,800
We'll just say,

304
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,400
..that the injury occurred
on the hockey ground.

305
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,800
Compressed vertebra!

306
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,160
Nobody will believe, got it?

307
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,000
Look. Your bosses will never
let the case go to the courts,

308
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
..because they already have
many cases against them.

309
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,720
And even if this case
does go to the court,

310
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,640
..the moment the magistrate
sees you in a wheel chair..

311
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,120
Wheel chair? - Yes, wheel chair.

312
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,200
And a cervical support on
your neck, I mean a belt.

313
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,560
The belt is to prevent your
bone from any pressure.

314
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,960
Prem, you're..
- It's just a matter of a few days.

315
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,000
After we get the money,
slowly, steadily,

316
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,320
..you'll get cured.

317
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,840
Not slowly, immediately.
I'm fine.

318
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,840
What are you doing?

319
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
The doctor's coming, lie down.

320
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,200
Go and fool someone else. I
won't get conned by you.

321
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,400
Lie down, else..

322
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,800
Who is it? - Me.

323
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
Hello, Shobha!

324
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,640
Alok, your wife is here.
- I've no wife.

325
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,280
Ok the one you divorced,
your ex-wife.

326
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,160
She's here to see you.

327
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,680
Come Shobha, Alok is
calling you inside.

328
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,920
How are you Alok?

329
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,360
He had a narrow escape.

330
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,840
The vertebra is
severely injured.

331
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
I read it all in
the Indian Times.

332
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,320
You are asking for compensation?

333
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,120
We have to.

334
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,920
How's Alok now?

335
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,800
If you take care of
him he'll get well.

336
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,200
Poor Alok, I'm so sorry.

337
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,080
Why have you come here? What
business do you've here?

338
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,160
I'm here just to
know, how you are.

339
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,920
Where was all this sympathy, a
year back, when you left me?

340
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,600
You left only two pieces
of bread in the kitchen.

341
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,240
I had to spend an entire month
wearing the same shirt.

342
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,760
Because I had no idea, which
laundry you gave my clothes to.

343
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,240
Please Alok, everyone
makes mistakes.

344
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,040
My salary was just Rs. 1200.

345
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,600
How could you survive on it?

346
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,600
You needed, Rs. 1,000 for
that stupid music teacher!

347
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,000
Ok, I left you.

348
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,240
But you could've
dragged me back.

349
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,280
Why did you remain a gentleman?
You could've beaten me.

350
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,840
Yes, I could've beaten you too!

351
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,280
Is it so easy to beat
wives these days?

352
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,000
No Shobha, don't
mind Alok's words.

353
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,240
He's sick, you see. He
has hurt his vertebra.

354
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,160
Maybe it has affected
his brains too.

355
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,760
Maybe!

356
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,640
He isn't aware of
what he is saying.

357
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,320
The doctor will get
the report now.

358
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,640
I'll tell you everything then.

359
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,320
Maybe you're getting late
and he needs some rest too.

360
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,000
Ok, Alok.

361
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,320
His fingers on the right
hand have become numb.

362
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,560
He can't shake hands.

363
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,600
Ok, Alok.

364
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,120
God knows what I saw in
Shobha that I married her.

365
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,800
She can't cook, can't
run the house!

366
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,800
All she does the whole day
is play the harmonium!

367
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,560
It seems you haven't
forgotten her yet.

368
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,840
Get lost, haven't forgotten!

369
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,200
Is it the truth?

370
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,520
You think Shobha was the
only girl in my life?

371
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,800
There were so many.

372
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,640
Rekha, Hema, Reena!

373
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,200
The fingers on this hand are numb.
Use the other one.

374
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,680
I'm not that dumb.

375
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,720
Look, she still loves you.

376
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,120
Didn't you see the
way she was crying?

377
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,560
You can bring her back.

378
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,960
Just act sick like this and
she'll come everyday to see you.

379
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
This is the only way
you'll win back your wife.

380
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,920
She didn't come all this
time, how will she come now?

381
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,960
Listen, I know you're
still in love with her.

382
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,320
You'll never get a
golden chance like this.

383
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:17,960
Yes!

384
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,440
Just keep doing as
I ask you to do.

385
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,480
You'll get your wife
and your money too.

386
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,000
Prem, will Shobha ever come back?
- Of course.

387
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,160
Do you know, what she did when
I told her you were hurt?

388
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,160
What? - She started crying.

389
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,400
Why did you tell the
poor girl then?

390
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,680
If I hadn't, how would
she have come here?

391
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,400
Good morning! - Good morning!

392
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm doctor Bhaskar, not Baster.

393
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,880
How are you?

394
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,200
Good. - Good, means he had
a good night's sleep.

395
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,120
Those sleeping pills.. - X-ray!

396
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:07,800
Thank you!

397
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,480
Sister, lower the bed.

398
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,080
What's wrong Alok?

399
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,400
My back! Raise the bed, quickly.

400
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,800
Sister! - Quickly!

401
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,640
Is the pain getting worse?

402
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,320
Of course it will.
It's a spinal injury.

403
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,800
Compressed vertebra!

404
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,400
Are you speaking the truth Dr.
Baster? Bhaskar.

405
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,160
Do you doubt it?

406
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,360
No, Why would I doubt you Dr.
Baskar?

407
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,960
Then stop your chattering!

408
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,200
Tell me if it pains
or not, right?

409
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Doctor, do it gently.
What if his neck bone..

410
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,000
Didn't I ask you to
stop chattering?

411
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:21,840
Prem.

412
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,840
Can he smoke, doctor? - Yes.

413
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,840
Will you have one?
- No, I've quit smoking.

414
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,960
Very good doctor!
Even I tried a lot..

415
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,640
Why are you smoking this way?

416
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Doctor, other fingers have gone numb.
- What?

417
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,720
Fingers have gone numb!
- Chattering again!

418
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,560
Doctor anyone would chatter
in such a situation!

419
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,120
It's a backbone injury and,

420
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,840
..the fingers are numb. How?
- So what?

421
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,480
All bones are linked
to the backbone.

422
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,000
And nerves too. - Is it?

423
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,240
Just imagine, if a train
runs over a wrist watch,

424
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,560
..what will happen to it's wheel,
spring balance and other parts?

425
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,640
I'm really fortunate that my
watch still beats properly.

426
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,280
All right. Now tell me
where it pains more,

427
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,200
..and where it's less.
- Yes, doctor.

428
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,480
Here? - Less.

429
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,480
Here? - Less.

430
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,720
Here? - A lot.

431
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,160
A lot!

432
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,280
We often get these
kinds of injuries.

433
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,600
The doctor of our club, Mr.
Date is very good.

434
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,000
He has a degree from America.

435
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,320
Ok, please go outside.

436
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,160
Aren't you Neela Paul, the
Gymkhana club's captain? - Yes.

437
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,160
I've brought these flowers for you.
- Thank you.

438
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,480
Ok then, you can now..

439
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,400
What was the result of
the match that evening?

440
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,080
We won by 3 goals.

441
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,240
But they were all
before half time,

442
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,240
..when you were there.

443
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,400
Nothing after that.

444
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,280
I had so many chances later.

445
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,640
But I don't know why I couldn't
score any goals later.

446
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,480
How sad?

447
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,280
Enough, now stop chattering.
Right, doctor?

448
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,000
You leave.

449
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,120
No smoking.

450
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,560
Have you ever hurt
your back before?

451
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,840
Earlier, on the back..
- I mean in your childhood.

452
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,120
The phone's ringing
since so long,

453
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,280
..why don't you pick it up?
- What?

454
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,000
Yes, it's ringing since so long.
Can't you hear?

455
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,680
How many nurses
are present here?

456
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:11,920
Two.

457
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,680
Prem, can we really
afford two nurses?

458
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,360
Doctor, do you still feel
this case is a simple one?

459
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,520
Shut those curtains.
- I'll do it.

460
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,680
Open your eyes wide and
look at that girl.

461
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,360
No, just keep looking there.
C'mon.

462
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,680
Open those curtains. - Yes.

463
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,320
Has he been affected mentally?

464
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,320
Will he go insane?

465
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,000
No matter what, please
be honest with me.

466
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
I'll bear it.

467
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
He has got a simple jolt.

468
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,200
4-5 days rest will cure him.

469
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,800
Thank god! He'll be all right.
But how can he?

470
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,160
I mean you said all the bones
are linked to the backbone

471
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,120
..and the nerves too.

472
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,960
Who knows, where he
has been affected?

473
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,400
You! - Toilet..

474
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:45,960
Hey You..

475
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,080
What happened to you?

476
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,760
My leg! What is wrong
with my leg, doctor?

477
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,680
As if I have no leg!

478
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,400
Nurse put him on the bed, quick!
- My leg!

479
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Careful, slowly.

480
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,840
Careful. Lie down.

481
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,960
Look, Dr. Bhaskar, I don't
want to chatter anymore.

482
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,200
But this case looks
very serious.

483
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,480
I'm really sorry, believe me, I
didn't want to hurt you in any way.

484
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,560
I've never hurt anybody
in my entire life.

485
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,120
Even though to those
who play unfairly.

486
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,240
Doctor, if you listen
to a layman's opinion..

487
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,280
I don't need a layman's opinion.

488
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,160
Sister, please note down.

489
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,160
It seems the backbone
is hurt elsewhere too.

490
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,280
Ask for Doctor
Nanavati's opinion.

491
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,560
I need some more X-rays,
encephalographs, EMG

492
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:57,040
..and get a tape too.
That's it for now.

493
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,840
Yes. The patient shouldn't
move from the bed.

494
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,840
He needs complete rest.

495
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
Good day! - Good day!

496
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,000
Before these flowers
wither, will you please..

497
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,440
Bye! - Bye!

498
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Good performance, thanks a lot.

499
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,000
Now rest assured you'll get
back your wife, Shobha.

500
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,760
Come in.

501
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Come, Mr. Magan, you've
come at the right time.

502
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,760
You've come so late!

503
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You've come so late!

504
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,160
This is our boss, Mr. Rungta,
the owner of our newspaper.

505
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,640
And this is our lawyer, Mr. Desai.
- Hello.

506
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,240
So what news have
you brought for us?

507
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,480
Sit down.

508
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,840
Alok Prakash draws a salary of Rs.
1200.

509
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,520
He's a staff photographer
in your newspaper.

510
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,280
He owns a nice flat in Khar.

511
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,560
One bedroom hall.

512
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,120
He was married to a
girl called Shobha.

513
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,800
But he got divorced
within a year.

514
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,640
Now he lives all alone.

515
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,200
He has just one
sister and a mother,

516
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,760
His mother's married..
Sister's married.

517
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,800
And mother lives
with her daughter.

518
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,200
Any history of fraud?

519
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,640
No. According to our
agency's investigation,

520
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,000
..he has never cheated anybody.

521
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,960
In fact, it's others
who have used him.

522
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,520
Alok Prakash is a very simple man.
- A simple man?

523
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,680
Where did you get
this idiot from?

524
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,640
That man has claimed 2 million!

525
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,080
Do you know? - Yes sir, we know,

526
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,240
..he has claimed 2 million.

527
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,120
Do you think 2 million is a
measly amount?! - No sir,

528
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,440
..it's a huge amount.

529
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
There are 3 more cases
against the newspaper.

530
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,680
If I lose, I'll lose 5 million!

531
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,000
Sir, please don't worry at all.

532
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,560
We'll do our best to
protect your newspaper.

533
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,840
To hell with the newspaper.
You protect my money!

534
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,520
Sir, we'll protect
your money too.

535
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,680
We've got all the papers
from Essel hospital.

536
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Mr. Magan is no ordinary man.

537
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,520
He had revealed all about
the Phoolvati murder case.

538
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,000
Fine then, but if we
lose any of these cases,

539
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,280
..your newspaper's finished.

540
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,560
I've many other businesses.

541
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,800
Yes Mr. Magan, please continue.

542
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,240
Alok Prakash's sister's
husband is Prem Sagar.

543
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,360
What name did you say?
- Prem Sagar.

544
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,440
He is the one handling the case.
- Who is this Prem Sagar?

545
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,840
So have you brought my fees?

546
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,680
How much is the fees, lawyer?
- Rs. 100.

547
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,280
Please keep Rs. 50 now. I'll
pay the rest after the case.

548
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
Please sir, as a favour.

549
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,800
This charity has
become a pain for me.

550
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,160
So tell me, how did
you break your leg?

551
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,360
Not my leg but the
bone on my elbow.

552
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,560
Yes, so how did your backbone..

553
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,680
Not backbone but the
elbow bone, sir.

554
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,680
You broke some bone, right?
- Yes.

555
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,680
Tell me how.

556
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,640
I was passing through
Linking Road.

557
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,240
On the footpath,
else on the road?

558
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,480
The road, sir. - Go on.

559
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,840
Look at this.

560
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,520
What's this?

561
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,160
A banana peel. I stepped
on it and slipped.

562
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,120
All right, keep it with you safely,
it may come in handy. - Yes.

563
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,360
Where did you fall exactly?

564
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,960
Exactly opposite
Gazebo restaurant.

565
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,960
That was bad.

566
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,720
Mr. Lawyer, there's such
pain in the back, you know?

567
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,960
It's sad that you fell
in front of the Gazebo.

568
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,640
Had you fallen a little ahead,
near Kapoor Lamps. - Yes.

569
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,360
You could've got lots of money.
- Really!

570
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,800
Yes.

571
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,840
Has the phone call come or not?

572
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,840
How strange, the call
hasn't come yet.

573
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,280
Fall and show me. - What?

574
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,600
You had fallen, right? Show me how.
- Yes.

575
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,200
Get our doctor to check
that Alok Prakash.

576
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,760
I'm sure he's faking it.

577
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,560
But for that we'll have to
take his lawyer's permission.

578
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,000
So what's the problem? Get it.

579
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,560
Barucha. - Yes sir?

580
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,080
Call him up.

581
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,320
Hello, please give the
phone to Prem Sagar.

582
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,560
Midweek's call, didn't
I say he will call?

583
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,600
Put him on.

584
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,560
Good morning, Mr. Barucha.
I'm fine.

585
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,600
She is fine too, how are you?

586
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
I heard you had some
gout trouble recently.

587
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,880
Ok that's cured now.
Yes, how can I help you?

588
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,080
Yes, Alok Prakash's case,
yes, I'm handling it.

589
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,520
I can't discuss that on
the phone right now.

590
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,680
There are too many people
present here in the office.

591
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,400
Where are you calling from?

592
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,600
From Mr. Rungta's office.

593
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,120
It's very close to my office.

594
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,840
If you say, I'll come there.

595
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,120
Your barrister Desai is there too.
Good. Very good.

596
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,360
I'll be there in 5
minutes, all right.

597
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,800
How much money will I get?

598
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,400
Nothing at all.

599
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,200
But it was good that you came here.
I'll get you something.

600
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:48,960
From where?

601
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,240
I can't say that exactly.
But we'll trap someone.

602
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,800
Prem Sagar is always on the
prowl to trap somebody.

603
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,480
If a finger's cut, he'll
say both hands are cut.

604
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,640
When he comes, we
should be lenient.

605
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,800
What lenient? Be harsh.

606
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,120
Of course, we've a job at hand.
We'll act strictly.

607
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,080
After shaking hands with him,

608
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,400
..do count your fingers.

609
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,080
I think it won't be right
for me to stay here.

610
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,800
Ok Mr. Magan, you leave.

611
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,960
Inspect Alok's case.

612
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,960
I won't pay you if
anything goes wrong.

613
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,480
Rest assured it's my
job to investigate.

614
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,280
Hello Mr. Magan, whom are
you uprooting today?

615
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,000
Is everything all right?
- Well, you can say that.

616
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,520
Go on!

617
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:41,840
Yes sir?

618
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,240
I'd like to meet Mr. Rungta,
editor Barucha and advocate Desai.

619
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,360
Who are you?
- Prem Sagar and Prem Sagar.

620
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,960
Please go in. They are
all waiting for you.

621
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,640
Thank you, dear.

622
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,080
And yes, you are free to
go home after lunch today.

623
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,080
Good morning Mr. Rungta.

624
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,320
You know him, Barucha, my editor.
- Hello!

625
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,000
And this is Desai, my lawyer.
- Hello.

626
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,800
Hello!

627
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,120
Does all three of you
have an office like this,

628
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,840
..else do all of you
sit here together?

629
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,640
Mr. Prem Sagar, we had to ask
you to come here because..

630
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,680
You want to decide.
- Decide what?

631
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,040
You don't want to decide?
- Of course not.

632
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,520
All right then. It's decided.

633
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,120
Mr. Prem Sagar, it's possible
that you've a strong case..

634
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,760
Barucha shut up! Your
case is very weak.

635
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,080
It's weak, surely.

636
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,320
This is just a labour
compensation case.

637
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,560
But.. - Yes?

638
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Look mister, Alok was injured
while he was working for you.

639
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,840
And that too such an injury
that he may have to remain,

640
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,240
..handicapped forever.

641
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,240
This isn't just a case
for compensation.

642
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,800
2 million is a small
price for your problem.

643
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,760
What nonsense?

644
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,840
All aspects, of this
case are in our favour.

645
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,120
In your favour?

646
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,960
Did you hear about the Haripal
versus Kanchanjunga building case?

647
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,400
What's the case?

648
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:25,920
All India Reporter, Delhi
edition part 16, year 1976,

649
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,560
..page 208 clearly states.

650
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,240
On the 10th floor, a worker,

651
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,200
..was cleaning the
glass of a window.

652
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
The plank on which he was
standing suddenly broke,

653
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,720
..and the worker..

654
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,920
Haripal Singh was cleaning
the glass of a window.

655
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,800
Obviously it was a risky job.

656
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
He must've got a
fair compensation..

657
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,520
The man who was cleaning
the glass was Suleiman.

658
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,240
Haripal Singh was the
name of a passer-by.

659
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,640
The poor guy was
just going to work,

660
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,160
..passing through
Barakhamba Road.

661
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,000
Suddenly people saw that
he was knocked out.

662
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,080
Just 4 days after the incident,

663
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,360
..the man's widow filed a case.

664
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,760
She got a compensation
of 1 million!

665
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,720
The case went in appeal
which was rejected.

666
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,080
That case is quite
different from ours.

667
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,120
No difference at all.

668
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,840
People in Delhi have lots
of money for charity. - Ok.

669
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,600
Take the case of Shanodevi vs.
Indian Railways.

670
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,680
All India Reporter,
part 3, page 340, 1965.

671
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,000
Shanodevi was going from
Ambala to Allahabad,

672
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,760
..to see her dying father.

673
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,520
Due to a dysfunctional latch
on the train's toilet door,

674
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,200
..it couldn't open.

675
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,200
And poor Shanodevi
was stuck inside.

676
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,840
That coach joined
some other train,

677
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,480
..and Shanodevi reached
Hyderabad, not Allahabad.

678
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,080
By then her father died and her
name vanished from his will.

679
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,080
Shanodevi then sued
the Indian Railways.

680
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,640
Do you know, for how much?

681
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,120
I've never heard about this case.
- This was expected of you.

682
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,320
Haven't you all
heard about it too?

683
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,640
For now, it'd be better
if we concentrate,

684
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,760
on the Alok Prakash case.
- With pleasure!

685
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,800
Have you seen the
hospital report?

686
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,360
Is something wrong?

687
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,960
No, it's proper. But..
- Rubbish!

688
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,040
I don't believe
this report at all.

689
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,360
Me too. - Neither do I.

690
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,160
We want our doctor to
examine the patient.

691
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,360
That's exactly, what I wanted!

692
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,760
If you refuse, we'll get a
court order for the check up.

693
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,200
Mr. Desai, he agrees to our..
- Barucha!

694
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,560
I'm telling you, I
completely agree with you.

695
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,840
Don't try any tricks on us.

696
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,520
We know you very well.

697
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,960
What do you mean, you agree?

698
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,280
I mean, if you want your doctor
to test the patient, go ahead.

699
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
You've no objections at all?

700
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,000
No, I have no objections at all.

701
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,800
In fact, I want that too.

702
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,320
This is just a matter
of few rupees to you.

703
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,600
But for me it's a
very tragic story.

704
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,840
Alok is my one and
only brother in law.

705
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,400
He is my wife's brother!

706
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,680
Maybe, he'll remain
handicapped all his life.

707
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,920
I'm sure the doctors
who examine him,

708
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,440
..are specialists and
experts in their field.

709
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,360
And ordinary people like us can
never afford their high fees.

710
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,000
Sir, I would in fact want you
to send Alok to America.

711
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,960
And get him examined in
that hospital in Houston,

712
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,720
..where our president, Gyani
Zail Singh was operated.

713
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,280
You don't worry. Alok
will be taken care of.

714
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,920
After all he's our employee.

715
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,680
I'm really happy to hear this.

716
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,840
I've full faith in
your assurance.

717
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,600
Anything else?

718
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,840
For now, I don't think there's
anything else we want.

719
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:11,960
Yes, you do want my written
consent to examine the patient.

720
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,680
Sure we do, that's
not a big deal.

721
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,960
Send a steno.

722
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,680
There's no need for that.
- Don't send.

723
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,080
I've already prepared
the letter of consent.

724
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,720
Actually, you need just 2
copies but I've brought 3.

725
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,400
Thank you.

726
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,480
Desai, give it here!

727
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,000
Ok sir. I'm in a
hurry, I'll leave now.

728
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,520
A client of mine
is waiting for me.

729
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,560
Interesting case.

730
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,080
I should drag the Crawford
Market Banana Association.

731
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,680
Before selling bananas they
must warn their customers,

732
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,080
..to throw the banana
skin in the dustbin.

733
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,000
Else it can prove fatal.
What say?

734
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,640
Ok. Good day.

735
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,200
Good morning, Alok!
- Good morning!

736
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,000
I've brought some stuff
from your house.

737
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,640
You may need it here.

738
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,000
A pair of slippers,

739
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,240
..a night suit..
- For how long do I've to stay here?

740
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,840
They want some special
doctors to examine you.

741
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,800
Then, back home.

742
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,400
I don't know why I
listened to you!

743
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,160
For this.

744
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,480
Where did you find this?
- Exactly where you had kept it.

745
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,360
Top of the cupboard,
inside the cookie tin.

746
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,200
Prem, remember 26th of July?

747
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,600
It was raining so heavily.

748
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,640
Yes and in that rain
you two took my car,

749
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,800
..and left for Panchgani.

750
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,000
Midway, your car broke down.

751
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,280
Both of us pushed the
car while getting wet.

752
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,120
Since that day my car
has gone for repairs,

753
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,840
..and hasn't yet returned.

754
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:56,160
After dropping your car at the
garage, we went all over Panchgani.

755
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:57,960
Shobha and me.

756
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,720
"In the journey of life,
the moment I found you,"

757
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:26,000
"it seems I found
everything in life."

758
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:34,440
"In the journey of life,
the moment I found you,"

759
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:42,040
"it seems I found
everything in life."

760
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:05,080
"Now the heart flies all the
time on the wings of music."

761
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:14,480
"Now the heart flies all the
time on the wings of music."

762
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,000
"Ever since I met you, my songs,

763
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:25,080
.. have become even
more melodious."

764
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,800
"In the journey of life,”

765
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:12,200
"I never imagined, I would
find so much happiness."

766
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:21,720
"I never imagined, I would
find so much happiness."

767
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:32,480
"Finding myself in your arms has
given me all I could've asked for."

768
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:40,200
"In the journey of life,
the moment I found you,"

769
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:48,520
"it seems I found
everything in life."

770
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:57,680
“I found everything in life.”

771
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,440
Why hasn't Shobha come? You
said, she'll come daily.

772
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,800
She'll come or maybe not.

773
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,240
What do you have to
do with her now?

774
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,320
Maybe she'll come here
running any moment now.

775
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,800
There she is near the door.

776
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,560
And there she
knocks on the door.

777
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,000
Come in.

778
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,640
What's that on your neck?

779
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,400
Ask your husband.

780
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,600
I've brought you some cooked
pulses and scrambled eggs.

781
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,800
Why do you always bring
boring food for him?

782
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,080
I've ordered special Chinese
food for him. - Chinese!

783
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,400
I'll eat here it too!

784
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,400
No, everything will be ruined.
You leave.

785
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,840
But this food? - You eat it.

786
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,440
As long as I'm here, you
don't worry about him.

787
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,000
Do one thing, take this key.

788
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,040
I've bought a new Mercedes.
Here.

789
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,600
New Mercedes?

790
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,400
Not me, you have.

791
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,960
Because you can't drive it
right now I'm using it.

792
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,560
But where did my car come from?

793
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,640
By the way, which is
your favourite color?

794
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,400
Red. - Red.

795
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,800
I'm sorry Alok, don't mind but
I haven't bought a red car.

796
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,000
I've bought.. What
a coincidence?

797
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,640
Suman is wearing the exact
colour sari as the car.

798
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:36,680
It's a Banarasi sari.

799
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,320
Prem, this imported car
and the Banarasi sari.

800
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,720
Where did the money come from?
- On credit.

801
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,800
These days I command great
prestige in the market.

802
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,480
What prestige?

803
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,160
The 2 million that
you're going to get.

804
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,680
Until we get the
money, this expense..

805
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,600
Expenses! Dear these days
whether they have money or not,

806
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,000
..who doesn't spend?

807
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,600
Look at our government.

808
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,800
It's spending millions.

809
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
You think it has so much money?

810
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,800
No! I believe in the
same motto too.

811
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,520
Credit today, cash tomorrow!

812
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,000
How did Shobha's
photo come here?

813
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,080
They are still in
love with each other.

814
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,400
Alok don't repeat the
same mistake again.

815
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,240
Look what she has
already done to you.

816
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,720
Damn it, when will you
women use your brains?

817
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,200
He is still lying here so that
Shobha comes here regularly.

818
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,400
Till he stays here,

819
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,760
..we can enjoy the
car and the sari.

820
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,000
Take this and go.

821
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,960
Suman, Shobha is coming here now.
Don't utter nonsense.

822
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,520
Hello! - Damn it.

823
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,400
This is Neela, she is
a good hockey player.

824
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,720
This is Suman, my sister.
- Hello.

825
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,320
Hello, I've brought a
very nice gift for you.

826
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,560
You will love it.

827
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,920
The whole team has
contributed to this gift.

828
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,000
Why did you bother?

829
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,960
This is automatic
and also has brake.

830
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,800
If you loosen it's lever,
it spins around too, look.

831
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,200
Great, it's amazing!

832
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,240
And I've brought a new thing.

833
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,400
Look, just attach
this to your handle.

834
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,800
And whenever you need
something, just..

835
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,200
Get well soon.

836
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,400
Get well! Why?

837
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,200
Yes. He'll get well. But
please leave from here.

838
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,000
This is the time table for the
special doctor's examination.

839
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,720
Doctor Inder, will start
his examination at 4 pm.

840
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,920
Electro-mammogram at 4.

841
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,880
Dynamometer test at 5.

842
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,280
Mildogram at 7.

843
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,000
Excuse me.

844
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,840
And why is this place crowded?

845
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,960
The visiting hours
are in the evening.

846
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,880
Suman didn't you hear what
the nurse said? Leave.

847
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,800
C'mon, hurry up.

848
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,200
And you, Ms. Bouquet.

849
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,160
I guess you too heard
the nurse, now leave.

850
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,560
Why is the special
doctor after him?

851
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,040
Needlessly troubling him.

852
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,320
We are fighting for
a huge amount.

853
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,840
In any case, these days you
can't trust people at all.

854
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,960
They try to extort money
by making false cases.

855
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,960
False cases?

856
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,360
No, he'll never do such a thing.

857
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,440
And anybody who does it
must be taught a lesson.

858
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,000
You know as a child, I had a similar
horn on my cycle. - Really?

859
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,600
Goodbye!

860
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,000
Bye. - Bye!

861
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,200
Thank you and your friends
for this vehicle.

862
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,560
This was our duty.

863
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,800
When you're all right at least
this will remind you of us.

864
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,600
Bye! - Bye!

865
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,480
This girl, what's her name?
- Neela.

866
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,280
Yes Neela, it would be nice
if you stay away from her.

867
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,960
Why? She's a nice, simple girl.

868
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,640
That's the problem.

869
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,320
We don't need innocent,
nice, simple people.

870
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,920
Mister, what the
hell are you doing?

871
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,960
Just moving my limbs to
improve blood circulation.

872
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,240
Else the legs may
really stop moving!

873
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,080
Just wait, stop!

874
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,040
There's no need for us to
improve blood circulation.

875
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,400
We must immediately lie down.

876
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,120
Why are you saying
'we' for everything?

877
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,120
Because we are equal
partners in this business.

878
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,240
Fifty-fifty. - What fifty-fifty?

879
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,480
I mean half-half.

880
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,560
And that too, because
you're my relative.

881
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,960
Look, I'm giving 90 per cent
of my time to this case.

882
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,000
And what's my share?
Only 50 per cent.

883
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,600
And if you goof up and
we lose the case,

884
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,800
I won't get 50 per
cent but this.

885
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,640
Lie down.

886
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,600
Is this the time to come?
Is this your service?

887
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,840
A man is starving here.

888
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,120
Anyway!

889
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,640
Great, Chinese food!

890
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,080
What's this?
- Fried rice, fried prawns,

891
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,680
..chicken chow mow. - Good!

892
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,120
Where's the tea?

893
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,680
You forgot the tea, damn!
Nurse, get a cup of tea.

894
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,400
Kindly!

895
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,360
Will you kindly get a cup of tea?
- That's it!

896
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,720
Is this your chicken chow chow?

897
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,680
With this injection, you'll
sail through the doctors' test.

898
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,200
I won't let a waiter to give
me an injection, got it?

899
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:01,920
Waiter!

900
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,080
He is the famous
doctor Gogi Anand.

901
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,800
Your newspaper guys think
they are too smart.

902
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,760
They have no idea that I'm
more than a match for them.

903
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,400
Go on. - Doctor, please be
careful while injecting.

904
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,960
I'll have to be careful.

905
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,280
I'm on parole from Yervada jail,

906
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,160
..else I'll be back in jail.

907
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,240
Yervada jail?

908
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,320
Yes, it's nearby, in Poona.

909
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,640
At the Mahalakshmi race course,

910
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,800
I was caught injecting a horse.

911
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,160
Is he a veterinarian?

912
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,600
No, he's actually a dentist.

913
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,440
But dentists are doctors too.

914
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,280
Where do you want the injection?

915
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,800
On the right hand
and the left leg.

916
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,480
Both of them should
go numb, lifeless.

917
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,560
Lifeless!

918
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,920
Hurry up, the hypnotist
will be here anytime.

919
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,960
What's the hypnotist for?

920
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,920
A hypnotist is needed before
every big test. Inject him.

921
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,920
Right one!

922
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,320
Inject him in a place,
where he has a mole.

923
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,400
So that there are no marks left.

924
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,280
Did you find one?

925
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,400
Found one.

926
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,160
Just relax!

927
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,480
What if this injection
goes wrong?

928
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,040
Simple, we'll frame
the hospital for it!

929
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,080
Saying they use dirty
needles for injecting.

930
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,240
Doctor, quick, now the
leg, the left one.

931
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,080
Left one. - C'mon, hurry up.

932
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,680
Please lie down.

933
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,520
Doctor, quick, the nurse
is coming this way.

934
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,800
I'm looking for a black mole.

935
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,600
Do you have savouries?
No, well forget it.

936
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:02,680
I don't want tea, take it.

937
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,720
What insolence is this?
- I'm sorry.

938
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,080
There's fifty less here.
- Come later.

939
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,800
Hello, Dr. Sarang here.

940
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,480
Press this please.

941
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:34,640
Ok.

942
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,160
Do you feel anything?

943
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,480
Yes, I do. - What?

944
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:50,960
The phone is ringing.

945
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,080
That's a mole.

946
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,640
'We have to decide,'

947
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:41,000
'if the patient's back and
his nerves are really hurt,'

948
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,800
'else he's faking it.'

949
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:48,120
'After our tests and
investigation, our opinion,'

950
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,480
'is that we couldn't
decide anything.'

951
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,640
'We also provide this bill for our
services and other costs incurred.'

952
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:02,520
'In all, the amount is Rs.
15,677 and 35 pence.'

953
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,400
'We hope our bill is
paid at the earliest.'

954
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:08,800
Nonsense!

955
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,480
Rs. 15,677 worth of nonsense!

956
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,920
Our case has attracted
a lot of publicity.

957
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,120
People are now aware
of the situation.

958
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,120
I think, we must compromise
with Prem Sagar.

959
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,120
Compromise!

960
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,320
A compromise on a
completely false case!

961
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:25,480
Never!

962
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,960
Sir, it isn't just a
question of money,

963
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,840
..but the prestige of
our newspaper too.

964
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,440
And that too, a fraud like
Prem Sagar should.. - Desai!

965
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,480
Don't you remember?

966
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,360
I lost 300,000 in the
defamation case in Hyderabad.

967
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,920
How much will you make me lose?

968
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,360
You have ruined me!

969
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,400
You two have disgraced me!

970
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,840
Barucha! - Yes sir?

971
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,800
Call up Prem Sagar. - Yes sir.

972
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,640
Sir, should I keep the waist tight?
- Loose. It will grow now.

973
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,240
41

974
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,480
Hello, put him on.

975
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,760
Hello, Mr. Barucha.

976
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:04,960
Today?

977
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,800
Today it's difficult for me
to leave office and come.

978
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,920
My tailor's taking my
measurements today.

979
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,480
And just like me, my tailor's
very busy too. – 31.

980
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,760
When I give him the
appointment, he's busy.

981
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,280
And when he gives me the
appointment I'm busy.

982
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,720
We have finally met
after 2 months.

983
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,800
They won't leave me today!

984
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,200
The courts will drag this
case for months now.

985
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,520
I mean, why don't we
come to a settlement?

986
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,560
Stitch a matching jacket for
this and a bow tie. - Ok.

987
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,960
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

988
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,160
To compensate for your charges
we can give your client,

989
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,240
..an amount of around..

990
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:52,600
Should I say 100,000?
- 100,000! 10,000.

991
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,760
We'll pay 10,000. Ok?

992
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,720
It'll be fine but
not enough at all.

993
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,600
As per my calculations,
the amount is a lot more.

994
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,600
Say around 2 million.

995
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,800
2 million!

996
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,480
2 million! Give it here.

997
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,520
Are you crazy, master Prem?

998
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,000
Does money grow on trees?

999
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,680
Do you know how much 2 million is?
- Hello, sir!

1000
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,680
Sir, why are you
getting furious?

1001
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,960
There are already 3-4 cases
against your company.

1002
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,080
I'm not saying
anything impractical.

1003
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,680
You said 10,000, I
said 2 millions.

1004
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,920
Now, I'll come a bit lower
and you climb a bit higher.

1005
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,600
1 million?

1006
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,760
I'm sure Alok's act
won't last long.

1007
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,800
He'll be caught one day.

1008
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,240
Alok is leaving the
hospital tomorrow.

1009
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,360
If you wish, I can start my
'People's Plan' tomorrow.

1010
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,480
What's that?

1011
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,480
A strict vigilance on Alok.
Hidden microphones.

1012
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,240
A tape recording of
all his conversation.

1013
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,600
And using small, 8 mm cameras,

1014
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,120
..a complete picture of his
activities through the day.

1015
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:10,800
Entire day's?!

1016
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,240
So that he freely
dances at night?!

1017
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,120
No, this'll not work.
Think of another plan.

1018
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,640
Then why don't you take
our 'Labyrinth plan'?

1019
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,920
'Labyrinth plan'? What's that?

1020
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,640
A hidden microphone
in every room.

1021
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,320
35 mm camera with zoom lens.

1022
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,400
A watch on his activities
round the clock.

1023
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,520
In Eastman colour.

1024
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:53,520
Do you want something?

1025
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,520
Just stop that song
you're humming.

1026
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,400
Sorry. I've kept your
clothes in the bathroom.

1027
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,080
Leave these clothes there too.

1028
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,760
Don't you have that today?
Your hockey practice?

1029
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,280
I do but I won't be going.

1030
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,520
I've so many chores here too.

1031
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,400
Good morning! - Hello! I've
packed up all the stuff here.

1032
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,480
I don't think you and
your wheel chair,

1033
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,400
..will fit into the Mercedes.

1034
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,960
We have a station wagon in our club.
- Look I..

1035
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,880
Please don't say no, I'll just get it.
- Listen..

1036
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,240
I'll be back in 5 minutes.

1037
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,400
Now that's weird!

1038
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,400
Better stay away from this pain.

1039
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,000
She is showing too much concern.
- What can I do about it?

1040
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,440
Should I tell her I'm fine?

1041
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,240
I'm acting because of you?

1042
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,760
Not because of me but
because of Shobha.

1043
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,240
What the hell are you doing?

1044
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,000
The door's open,
someone will see.

1045
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,040
I don't care. - Alok!

1046
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,720
I'm leaving, Prem.

1047
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,920
On my two feet and without
this damn collar!

1048
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,400
Have you lost your mind?

1049
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,080
Have you gone mad?

1050
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,320
After doing so much?

1051
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,320
They are almost ready
to compromise.

1052
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,560
Have you seen Neela?

1053
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,080
Have you seen how what our
fraud has done to her?

1054
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,320
She still thinks she's guilty.

1055
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,160
She thinks I'm handicapped
because of her.

1056
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:26,320
I'll be on this chair all
my life because of her!

1057
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,080
I don't want a decent
girl like Neela to..

1058
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,800
Do you want Neela or Shobha?
- Stop your rubbish!

1059
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,080
You know why Shobha left you?

1060
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,320
Because you're a complete dumb ass.
Idiot!

1061
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,360
Coward! A fool!

1062
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,000
Don't know why your X-rays
didn't show all this.

1063
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,760
Who's it? - Alok.

1064
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,320
It's Shobha.

1065
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,600
I'll go and change.

1066
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,800
Hello Shobha!
- Hello! How's Alok doing?

1067
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,840
He does relapse occasionally
but the doctors say,

1068
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,960
..he'll recover slowly.

1069
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,720
Why don't you come daily?
- Is he depressed?

1070
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:27,960
Why wouldn't he be depressed?

1071
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,840
Don't you remember our deal?

1072
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,320
It's so difficult
to come everyday.

1073
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,400
What do I tell you?

1074
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,680
Don't you want Alok to benefit?

1075
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,440
Get some money? - Why not?

1076
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,680
With you around,
he'll surely get it.

1077
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,600
And as long as you're here
I'm sure he will get it.

1078
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,120
Alok needs a lawyer like
me and a wife like you.

1079
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,280
Come along.

1080
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,320
Hello Shobha, suddenly today..

1081
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,320
I've come to see you.

1082
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,120
I wanted to come earlier too,

1083
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,280
..but feared if
you'd talk to me.

1084
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,160
The last time I came,
you were so angry.

1085
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,840
You didn't even
speak nicely to me.

1086
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,080
Due to the drugs,

1087
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,040
..don't know what
I said that day.

1088
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,480
It's good, Shobha
that you're here.

1089
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,160
I'm leaving the hospital today.

1090
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:13,760
Where are you going?

1091
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,560
I don't know. Wherever
Prem takes me.

1092
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,800
Why? You could come to our flat.

1093
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,960
You remember our old flat?

1094
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,160
How could I forget it?

1095
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,120
We had gone there
after our marriage.

1096
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,040
Those three wooden
swans on the wall.

1097
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,040
The sofa set we had brought
from the scrap dealer.

1098
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,560
And our sweet cat, Shabnam.

1099
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,720
Everything is still the
same, exactly the same.

1100
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,200
Those swans are still there.

1101
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,800
That worn out sofa
is still there.

1102
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,840
Only the cat has run away.

1103
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,680
Maybe I wasn't good enough.

1104
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:49,960
Why do you say that?

1105
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,640
Maybe Shabnam wasn't
good enough, right?

1106
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,760
What if I stay with you
till you recover fully?

1107
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,680
My answer would always be yes.

1108
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,800
But you may have your
own compulsions.

1109
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,120
Shobha, of late I don't
know anything about you.

1110
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,720
You decide if you
have a problem or..

1111
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,240
No Alok, I'll stay with you.

1112
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,160
What's the problem
in staying with you?

1113
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,760
I'm leaving now, good night.

1114
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,320
Goodnight Shobha!

1115
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,720
Bye Prem and thanks.

1116
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,400
Shabnam is coming back.

1117
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,800
Thank you Prem.
Goodbye hospital.

1118
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,400
What's happening? 1, 2, 1, 2.

1119
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,000
See what's happening.

1120
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,800
I said see what's happening.

1121
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,560
Bhangra dance! - What?

1122
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,360
Is the lame man dancing?
- Yes. Dancing!

1123
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:20,920
Move!

1124
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,200
Look.

1125
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:23,640
C'mon!

1126
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,800
1, 2.

1127
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:33,000
Very good. C'mon, 1, 2. C'mon.

1128
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,600
Is this Bhangra dance? - Yes.

1129
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,280
Is this Bhangra dance? - Yes.

1130
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,120
Is this the time to joke? - No.

1131
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,320
Mr. Magan, I think we're
just wasting our time.

1132
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,800
I think that guy is genuine.

1133
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,520
He could be genuine but our
job is to investigate.

1134
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,360
Got it! Spying!

1135
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,800
Mr. Magan, that girl dresses
him up with her own hands.

1136
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:59,200
Goes to the bathroom with
him, lays him on the bed.

1137
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,120
Later even feeds
him passionately.

1138
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,720
And you think he's acting?

1139
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,520
Look Johnny, once I was after
a man for three months.

1140
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:12,720
I observed for three months, a
woman used to massage him daily.

1141
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,600
But do you know what I
suddenly saw one day? - What?

1142
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,120
The man was massaging the woman.
- Really?

1143
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,280
Yes, he was caught red handed.

1144
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:26,400
But our former camera man,
whom you've replaced.

1145
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,520
What's his name? - Nandu, go on.

1146
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,480
The idiot got so engrossed
in watching the massage,

1147
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,760
..that he forgot to
switch on the camera.

1148
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,840
Mr. Magan, you should've said,

1149
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,120
..once more, take two.

1150
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,800
I've arranged everything and the
committee people have agreed too.

1151
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,120
You're coming to the
Gymkhana ground on the 27th.

1152
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,360
What for?

1153
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,400
We have a match there.

1154
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,280
Gymkhana club vs. India 11.

1155
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,560
Alok Prakash Benefit
match, just for you.

1156
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,560
No. - What no?

1157
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,960
You'll watch our match with
the committee members.

1158
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,520
You'll be introduced to our
players during half time.

1159
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
After which a small speech
from you, that's it.

1160
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:08,200
No Neela, thank you very much.
No need for all that.

1161
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,560
Why not?

1162
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,280
Aren't you doing
enough for me already?

1163
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,400
Yes, I'm doing very little? Ok?

1164
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,560
Are you married?

1165
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,200
I was but my wife divorced me.

1166
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,200
Did she divorce you?

1167
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,000
You can say that. - Why?

1168
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,480
Shobha loves singing.

1169
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,720
She sings nicely too.

1170
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,920
She wanted to be a playback
singer in the film industry.

1171
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,240
In the course of that she
met a music director.

1172
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,280
He must've praised
her, given her hopes.

1173
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,800
That he'd do something.

1174
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,320
He'd make a star singer.

1175
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,000
And then all she could
think of was singing.

1176
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,560
She used to often go out of town.
Madras, Calcutta.

1177
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,600
God knows where else.

1178
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:25,400
Then we started drifting
away from each other.

1179
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,920
Actually Shobha loves
money, fame, fancy cars,

1180
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,400
..parties and luxuries.

1181
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,000
I couldn't fulfill these needs.

1182
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,480
Then we got separated.

1183
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:46,480
Did she remarry?
- I don't know, maybe not.

1184
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,200
Do you want your
wife to come here?

1185
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,400
Doesn't anyone tell you
anything about coming here

1186
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,760
..and doing all my work?

1187
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,520
Tell me, do you want
your wife to come here?

1188
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,400
Is every desire ever fulfilled?

1189
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,080
You're right.

1190
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,360
What is it, Neela?

1191
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:26,920
Nothing.

1192
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,600
Didn't you meet Alok today?

1193
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,760
It seems you're really
falling in love with him.

1194
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:13,560
"On one hand you never
ever think about me."

1195
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:30,560
"On one hand you never
ever think about me."

1196
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:39,640
"On the other hand I can't
stop thinking about you."

1197
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:48,000
"On one hand you never
ever think about me."

1198
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:34,680
"Your eyes couldn't read
what my eyes said."

1199
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:43,160
"Even I couldn't express
what was in my heart."

1200
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:56,240
"Your eyes couldn't read
what my eyes said."

1201
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:05,160
"Even I couldn't express
what was in my heart."

1202
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:13,480
"How is anyone to
solve this dilemma?"

1203
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:22,640
"How is anyone to cool
down his unseen fire?"

1204
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:31,280
"On one hand you never
ever think about me."

1205
01:19:52,680 --> 01:20:00,600
"Unknowingly this heart
has bonded with you."

1206
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:09,360
"Each heart beat of mine is
in tune with that bond."

1207
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:17,880
"With every breath comes
your name on my lips."

1208
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:27,080
"How do I say all this to you?"

1209
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:35,520
"On one hand I can't stop
thinking about you."

1210
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:44,200
"On the other you never
ever think about me."

1211
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:53,280
"On the other you never
ever think about me."

1212
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,840
Good morning Alok!
- Good morning!

1213
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,760
Did Shobha come? - No, not yet.

1214
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,600
Don't worry, she'll be here.

1215
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,560
And that pain, Neela?

1216
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,560
She just left. Listen Prem.

1217
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,080
Neela wants to organize a
match in her Gymkhana.

1218
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:12,000
To raise money for me.

1219
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,320
We have to stop her at any cost.

1220
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,720
It isn't a bad idea at all.

1221
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,000
This Neela has turned
out to be a smart girl.

1222
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,840
I'll have to discuss
this idea with her.

1223
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Where were you since morning?

1224
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,400
Where was I?

1225
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,600
I was busy with work, sir.

1226
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,280
And that too your work.

1227
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,120
I got statements of 15 people
watching the match that day,

1228
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,600
..sitting on the first two rows.

1229
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,520
You bought a new cigarette case?

1230
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,400
Yes, 22 carats, consider
it as your own.

1231
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:55,600
You know Alok, in our business one
has to be very alert, always.

1232
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:01,400
We should know, what
the enemy wants.

1233
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:09,720
What his intentions are?
And what his moves are.

1234
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:20,320
We must always be one
step ahead of the enemy.

1235
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,360
Great, you've bought
many new books here.

1236
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,960
But they are all
boring subjects.

1237
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,720
Don't you have any
spy books here?

1238
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,720
As a child I loved them.

1239
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,560
I've read a lot of spy books.

1240
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,760
But my favourite spy was Sherlock
Holmes. It was great fun.

1241
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,440
This house looks
very neat and tidy.

1242
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,960
Thanks to Neela.

1243
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,720
She painted the walls
before I came here.

1244
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,520
And the pest control guys
have sprayed all the rooms.

1245
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,720
Pest control!

1246
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,080
In all the rooms?

1247
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,680
I think they started doubting.

1248
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,960
Didn't I tell you not to keep
the mic behind the books?

1249
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,320
Then was your idea a better one?

1250
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,840
To keep the mic in a tea
pot during breakfast?

1251
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:23,520
You act smart!

1252
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,840
Read this court appeal.

1253
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,840
I don't understand
this, don't show me.

1254
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,840
It's very important, especially
the line at the bottom.

1255
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,760
Isn't that interesting?

1256
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,840
What paper is he showing him?

1257
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:41,520
The camera can't, read
that from so far.

1258
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,080
I hate those people,

1259
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,360
..who instead of saying it
clearly, speak in riddles.

1260
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:57,120
Alok, is this water heater
working properly? - Yes!

1261
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,200
Did you benefit from it?
- Yes, slightly.

1262
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,480
I can't put it on just
show me how to do it.

1263
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,480
Can't you see..

1264
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,360
All your rooms have
mikes like this one.

1265
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:57,760
And in those rooms, your
movements are being recorded.

1266
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,240
Shooting. - Shooting!

1267
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,640
Yes with a camera!

1268
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,480
There are spies after you.

1269
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:05,280
So we'll shut all the windows and
remove all mikes. That's it!

1270
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,520
Not now.. - Why?

1271
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:07,240
Let me explain.

1272
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,480
Look Alok, every word of
ours is being recorded.

1273
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,480
And all our moves are
being caught on camera.

1274
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,680
Now we know this but those
idiots don't know that we know.

1275
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,720
We can take advantage of
this situation. - How?

1276
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,800
We can use these microphones
to mislead them.

1277
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,400
They'll believe in
whatever we say.

1278
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,480
I don't understand anything.

1279
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,280
You'll understand very soon.

1280
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:43,760
This will help us
succeed very soon.

1281
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,120
I'll lay such a trap for him,

1282
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,960
..he'll immediately
agree to a compromise.

1283
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,520
Else I'm not Prem
Sagar B.A.L.L.B.

1284
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,440
Mr. Magan, one more new girl.

1285
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,280
Shut up and do your job.

1286
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,400
I'm doing my job. I'm
sure it's his wife.

1287
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:03,600
Let me also see.

1288
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,360
Come, Shobha. Where
had you been?

1289
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,680
You said, you would
take care of me.

1290
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,880
I went for a program.

1291
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,160
But I'm here now.

1292
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,440
Let me see, how you look!

1293
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,160
Look. How do I look?

1294
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:31,040
Exactly as you were before.

1295
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,200
And how do I look?

1296
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,600
Just like you were
after our wedding.

1297
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:39,960
I haven't changed too.

1298
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,400
How long will you stay here?

1299
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I had a program in Calcutta,

1300
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,800
..but I told them I
won't be able to come,

1301
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,960
..as a relative was sick.

1302
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,360
You did the right thing.

1303
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,080
I'm sick and also your relative.

1304
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,800
Maybe I'm not anymore but
I was once upon a time.

1305
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,800
Alok, please. As soon
as you get some money,

1306
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,920
please get this sofa repaired.

1307
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,080
Of course I will,
long live Prem.

1308
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,240
If I wish, I can stuff
this sofa with money.

1309
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,400
Do you know, I've
a new Mercedes?

1310
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,400
Prem drives it these days
but it's actually mine.

1311
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,920
What is most important is
that you should get better.

1312
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,120
What does the doctor say?

1313
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,720
He says, I've hurt my backbone.

1314
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,960
I've pulled some nerves too.
They are all linked.

1315
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,280
But you'll see I'll
get well very soon.

1316
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,640
I'll start walking and running
before the doctors' deadline.

1317
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,800
But I'm not sure, Shobha.

1318
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,720
Maybe I've to spend many
months in this chair.

1319
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,600
How long will this lie go on?
- What?

1320
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:50,680
I lied about a relative's sickness
and didn't go to Calcutta.

1321
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,320
And I came here, to meet you.

1322
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,000
Come Neela, this is Shobha.

1323
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:15,600
Didn't I tell you?

1324
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:17,800
Shobha, this is Neela.

1325
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,320
She has done a lot for me.

1326
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,160
You weren't able to come.

1327
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:25,800
She took care of me.

1328
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,000
I'll see what's there in the kitchen.
- Ok.

1329
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,560
Neela, help Shobha
with everything.

1330
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,640
Shobha knows little about the kitchen.
- Yes.

1331
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:49,360
Excuse me.

1332
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:52,200
Please don't bother,
I'll do everything.

1333
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,920
It was my ball that hit him.

1334
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:56,840
I felt so bad that day.

1335
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,640
Since then, I'm serving Alok.

1336
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,160
So that I can make up
for what I've done.

1337
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,600
What's your fault?

1338
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:08,160
Alok is so nice, so
naive, so understanding.

1339
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,200
You don't have to
tell me what Alok is.

1340
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,800
You didn't come for two days.
He used to wait for you daily.

1341
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,840
Mr. Prem can't think about
anything else but money.

1342
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,600
But Alok was always
talking about you.

1343
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:28,080
That's how Alok is. Sweet
but naive and foolish.

1344
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,280
If Alok has his way, no one
would get even a single rupee.

1345
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,680
The two are in the kitchen.
Johnny, see what he's doing.

1346
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,400
He's going to the kitchen too.

1347
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,840
Where has Shobha gone?
- To take a shower.

1348
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,320
Shobha is very fond of pickles.

1349
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:49,800
Serve it on a separate plate.

1350
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,800
There's no pickle.

1351
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:52,400
Look in this cupboard.

1352
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,800
I've hidden two bottles
from the maid.

1353
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,560
It's kept up there, behind.

1354
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,280
Mango and pepper pickles.
Get them both.

1355
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:07,520
Yes.

1356
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,360
What do you think of Shobha?

1357
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,600
Look at me, I'm asking you.

1358
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:21,760
You have just met her.

1359
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,360
Have dinner with us.

1360
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:26,800
No, I've to leave.

1361
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,760
Neela, you've done a lot for me.

1362
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,040
You are always at my service.

1363
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,640
But you've your own work too.

1364
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,040
Shobha has come back too.

1365
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,720
I feel she will be staying here.

1366
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,560
So you don't have
to bother anymore.

1367
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:51,760
Thank you very much for doing
so much for me. - Alok!

1368
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:03,640
I don't know what relation
you have with Alok.

1369
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:05,720
And neither do I want to know.

1370
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:10,120
You should be aware
that I'm Alok's wife.

1371
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,720
And if another woman serves
him, I don't like it.

1372
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,120
You had better not come
here from tomorrow.

1373
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,240
What's wrong with you?

1374
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,720
All I wanted was to see
Alok getting well.

1375
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,000
I wanted to see him
walk normally again.

1376
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:39,640
Nothing else.

1377
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,600
Calm down, Neela. What's
the use of crying?

1378
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,160
I'll go away from here.
I won't stay here.

1379
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,880
Don't say such things, Neela.

1380
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,480
Your Tata Gold Cup
Tournament is coming up.

1381
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,320
The responsibility of
the club is on you.

1382
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:56,680
The club is surviving only
because of you. Calm down.

1383
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,400
You have become thin.

1384
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,480
I've lost 5 pounds.

1385
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:18,680
Should I open your collar?

1386
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,800
Actually, I do these
things myself.

1387
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:06,720
"Put off the burning lights."

1388
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:11,680
"Then lay your
loving eyes on me."

1389
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:18,760
"I'm not a stranger,
recognize me."

1390
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:24,800
"Take me in your arms,
why stay apart?"

1391
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:30,040
"Don't think at all today."

1392
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:35,400
"Put off the burning lights."

1393
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:06,200
"Everything is just the
same, nothing has changed."

1394
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:19,960
"Everything is just the
same, nothing has changed."

1395
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:26,840
"This opportunity is beautiful
and so is the destination."

1396
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:33,720
"Then why only wish,
when I'm here?"

1397
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:39,800
"Why hide your desires?"

1398
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:50,120
"Remove all barriers today.
Don't think of anything."

1399
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:56,160
"Just put off the
burning lights."

1400
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:00,520
Let me see, who is on the phone.

1401
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,160
Hello! Yes.

1402
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,800
Congratulations on
your new life, Shobha.

1403
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,120
It's good that you've come back.

1404
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,560
All right, how is my little kid?

1405
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:19,000
He's good.

1406
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,640
Our good old days
are back again.

1407
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,360
We just had our food.

1408
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,000
Now we are going to bed.

1409
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:26,640
Going to bed!

1410
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:28,480
Give him the phone.

1411
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:33,960
How's this sari?

1412
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,040
I'll just wear my embroidered
sari too and show you.

1413
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,520
Yes, lad.

1414
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:47,480
If I were in your place,
I'd control myself.

1415
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:52,840
I know your wife has
come after a long time.

1416
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,920
I can understand your condition.

1417
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,560
But control yourself.

1418
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:03,400
This isn't the right place or
time for love and romance.

1419
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,480
Got it? Don't be foolish.

1420
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,560
Are you my god that
I've to obey you.

1421
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,160
God! - What's he saying?

1422
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:14,800
But listen.. - Ok, as you wish.

1423
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,800
But whatever you
do, pose nicely.

1424
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:20,560
Because you're being
shot from outside.

1425
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:26,800
How is this one? - It's rubbish!

1426
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:51,760
"Those beautiful moments
are back again."

1427
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:05,400
"Those beautiful moments
are back again."

1428
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:12,520
"Let's repeat the
same saga again."

1429
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:19,520
"In this dewy night, these
moments are so silken."

1430
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:25,800
"It seems time
itself has stopped."

1431
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:31,360
"Remove all distances."

1432
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:36,480
"Put off the burning lights."

1433
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:43,400
"I'm not a stranger,
recognize me."

1434
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:49,640
"Take me in your arms,
why stay apart?"

1435
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:54,680
"Don't think at all today."

1436
01:38:54,760 --> 01:39:00,800
"Don't think at all today."

1437
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,560
C'mon, Neela, why are you
standing like a corpse?

1438
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:29,680
Come.

1439
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,400
Look what that accident
has done to Neela. - Yes.

1440
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,440
We lost yesterday's match too.

1441
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,920
Neela couldn't score
even a single goal.

1442
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,000
Thankfully it was a friendly match,
else we would've been ashamed.

1443
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:44,400
Neela, day after is the
Tata Gold Cup match.

1444
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,280
Do you wish to lose it?

1445
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,560
Why don't you answer? Are you
the captain for nothing?

1446
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:54,000
What did you say?

1447
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,280
Your problem is your
personal business.

1448
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:57,920
Why are you disgracing the club?

1449
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,520
Shut up Sunita. - Why should I?

1450
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,760
If you are the captain, why
do things that are shameful?

1451
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,640
Neela! - Sunita!

1452
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:11,560
What are you doing? Neela!

1453
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,760
What are you doing? - Leave her.

1454
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:17,160
You dare hit me!

1455
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,800
No one is listening to me.
Stop it!

1456
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:23,400
I won't spare you! Let go!
What are you doing?

1457
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:25,520
Sunita listen to me. Stop it!

1458
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:29,000
Hello Shobha! - Hello!

1459
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:34,800
You're wearing a sexy dress today.
Sit.

1460
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,600
Is everything in control? - Yes.

1461
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:48,160
Young lad, take this,
our company's paper.

1462
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,080
There are seven copies,
sign all of them.

1463
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:53,840
Which company is this?

1464
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,280
Alok Prakash Charities Trust.

1465
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:01,320
I didn't get it.

1466
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,080
The day you get it, you'll
be proud of your Alok.

1467
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,000
Done? Very good!

1468
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,760
All right, done
with this for now.

1469
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,400
Now…Yes!

1470
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,800
I've spoken to Neela and
made all arrangements.

1471
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,960
Next Saturday, at the
Gymkhana ground,

1472
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,360
..there will be a grand
hockey benefit match.

1473
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,920
Alok will be given an award of
honour during the interval.

1474
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:32,280
After which, all the
lights will be turned off.

1475
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:36,800
And then, 50,000 spectators
will be requested,

1476
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,560
..to light up a match stick,

1477
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:44,080
..and pray for Alok's
speedy recovery.

1478
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:48,000
Just imagine what a
sight that would be!

1479
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,280
50,000 burning matchsticks
in the darkness!

1480
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,320
Later, a spotlight will
be focused on Alok.

1481
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:57,400
And Alok will then get
up and go to the mic.

1482
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,000
Slowly, gradually.

1483
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,720
There will be huge applause.
And then,

1484
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:06,560
Alok, will make a grand
presentation of our scheme.

1485
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:16,400
Except the doctor's fees, all
the money collected that night,

1486
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:20,720
..will go to the Alok Prakash
Charity Trust for the handicapped.

1487
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,800
I don't get you.

1488
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:27,480
We don't want people to
point fingers at us,

1489
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:30,840
..and say that we have filed
this case to get rich.

1490
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:33,320
We may not be super rich,

1491
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,640
..but according to our capacity,

1492
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,640
..we are helping the poor
and unfortunate people.

1493
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,440
So that they see a ray of
hope in this darkness.

1494
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:49,240
Johnny, get up.
- Don't bother me.

1495
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,280
Get up, it's already 4 hours.

1496
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,400
Don't fool me.

1497
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:59,000
Get up, it's important. I've to go
to meet Mr. Rungta immediately.

1498
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:00,080
You start the camera.

1499
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:06,360
Damn! It would've been nice if
I had listened to my uncle,

1500
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,400
..and set up a liquor business.

1501
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:13,360
I have to go to the office.

1502
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:17,280
One very important
call is about to come.

1503
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,640
50,000 burning match sticks.

1504
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,200
I hope it doesn't rain.

1505
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:32,840
I'm afraid we won't be
able to repair the sofa.

1506
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:36,560
Prem.

1507
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,560
What's this joke about
handicapped and charity trust?

1508
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:43,320
Joke? - Don't fool around.

1509
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,640
We are getting this money
after such hardship.

1510
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:46,800
Why blow it up this way?

1511
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,240
No one's blowing up money.

1512
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:53,360
This is just to pressurize
the newspaper's lawyers.

1513
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,480
They can fight with me.

1514
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,560
But they can't face the Charity
Trust for the handicapped.

1515
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:01,720
When the judge hears,

1516
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,240
..the money is
going for charity,

1517
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:06,840
I can bet we will win the case.

1518
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:08,360
But what will we get?

1519
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:09,800
And the money I want?

1520
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:12,680
Everyone will get their
share at the right time.

1521
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,360
But if you give it to..
- Hold on.

1522
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,760
I'll have to tell you
the truth one day.

1523
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,600
Listen. All the rooms upstairs,

1524
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,680
..have hidden microphones fixed.

1525
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,240
The spies can hear
all that we speak.

1526
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,320
And they are also
taking our pictures.

1527
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,000
Pictures? - Yes. From where?

1528
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:34,240
From the flat on the other
side of this road. - Why?

1529
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,040
Ok, I'll disclose this one too.

1530
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:43,160
Listen. Our Alok is
absolutely fine.

1531
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,720
It's all an act.

1532
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:48,080
He's acting on my orders
and also for you.

1533
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:51,960
So that you always stay near him
and all of us earn millions.

1534
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,320
Four different specialist
doctors have examined him.

1535
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:55,640
Are they all stupid?

1536
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,280
No, they aren't stupid but
I'm a tad smarter than them.

1537
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:02,840
But why do you care?

1538
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:05,840
You remain concerned
about your money.

1539
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,840
What do I need to do?

1540
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,400
Just keep an eye on Alok.

1541
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,680
Don't allow him to
do anything silly.

1542
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,800
Keep him glued to the chair.

1543
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,520
I'll be really thankful
to you if you do this.

1544
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:24,120
How much?

1545
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,600
Rest assured, it's
enough for everyone.

1546
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,160
I'll try my best.
- That's a good girl.

1547
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:34,000
You've become thinner!

1548
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:42,400
'Except the doctor's fees, all
the money collected that night,'

1549
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:46,640
'will go to the Alok Prakash Charity
Trust for the handicapped.'

1550
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:47,640
'We don't want..'

1551
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,000
You know what this means?

1552
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,760
Just another ordinary
move by Prem Sagar.

1553
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:56,400
It isn't an ordinary move!

1554
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:00,320
When the judge realizes that all
the money is going for charity,

1555
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:03,120
..he'll order us to pay
the maximum amount!

1556
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,600
5 million! We've already
lost two cases!

1557
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:09,800
Sir, I still think all
this is just an act.

1558
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,320
You think!

1559
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:14,800
Do I pay you fees to
know what you think!

1560
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:19,320
I'm really sorry, I couldn't
do anything so far.

1561
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:23,240
Yes, you didn't do a thing and
that too in Eastman colour.

1562
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,680
I'll try again.

1563
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,480
Enough of your trials!

1564
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:30,000
You're dismissed from today.
Get lost!

1565
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,840
Let me do my job, sir.
- Get lost!

1566
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:36,000
Pay me only after I do the job well.
- I'm ruined.

1567
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:51,400
Hello? Speaking.

1568
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,880
Bharucha? Who?

1569
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:01,360
Editor, sir! Hello, How are you?

1570
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,240
You want to meet me?

1571
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,280
Hold on. Let me check in my diary.
Where is it?

1572
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,320
Here it is.

1573
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:14,320
Ok. Tomorrow?

1574
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:19,240
It's Sunday tomorrow. No, I'm
too busy on Sunday and Monday.

1575
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:23,480
Tuesday. That's also
out of question.

1576
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,960
Wednesday is out too.

1577
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:27,960
Thursday is out too.

1578
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:32,840
Friday, I've no time
to even die on Friday.

1579
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,080
Monday? One minute.

1580
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:42,120
11 to 10!

1581
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,200
11 to 11:10 is when we can meet.

1582
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,960
Will that be too late? By the
way what are you doing now?

1583
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,840
Then why don't you come here?
You're nearby.

1584
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,680
I'm expecting a client but
anyway, take a chance.

1585
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:00,440
So you're coming, right?
Ok, see you.

1586
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:56,320
Come in.

1587
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:58,840
Welcome, sir.

1588
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,320
Please pardon my office, it's a
bit disorganized. - Not at all.

1589
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,640
Actually, my secretary used to do
all this. Then she got married.

1590
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,200
Too bad! When did
she get married?

1591
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:12,720
About ten years back.
She married me.

1592
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,800
Please sir, sit here. - Come.

1593
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:19,120
Take care.

1594
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,800
Excuse me, please sit here.

1595
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:32,160
You're still standing.
We've this!

1596
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:41,800
Please sit.

1597
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,920
All right then, please proceed.

1598
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:53,600
We'd like to finish Alok
Prakash's case by March 31st.

1599
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:57,480
Yes. - So that our accounts
in the new year stay clear.

1600
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:02,560
Actually, we're legally
against a settlement.

1601
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:07,240
But still, we've convinced Mr.
Rungta with great difficulty.

1602
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:12,200
And on our paper's behalf, we
can pay you 20,000 as penalty.

1603
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:17,480
Desai, if you're
talking about 20,000,

1604
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:21,000
I'm sure sir must've
permitted at least 30 to 40.

1605
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:24,280
And if sir has permitted
30 to 40,000,

1606
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:27,720
..then he can surely pay at least 50.
Right sir?

1607
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:31,800
Sir, I say, instead of dealing
in such puny amounts,

1608
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,120
..why don't we start the
negotiations from 50,000?

1609
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:36,240
50,000?

1610
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,320
We can pay 25,000 at the most.

1611
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,200
Sir, even 50,000 is
unacceptable to us.

1612
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:43,200
All right, 30,000.

1613
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,720
Why are you in such haste?

1614
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,240
Maybe, you wouldn't have
to pay us anything at all.

1615
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:51,120
Let this case go to the court.

1616
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:52,800
The judge will think.

1617
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:54,840
Please sir.

1618
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:58,000
32,000!

1619
01:51:00,280 --> 01:51:02,400
You've come to my office
for the first time,

1620
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,160
will you have something?
Tea, coffee?

1621
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:08,640
35,000. - Soft drinks?

1622
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:10,560
40,000!

1623
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:16,040
40,000. Are you free
on Saturday night?

1624
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:17,200
Yes, we are free.

1625
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,920
Have you heard of Wankhede
hockey stadium? - Yes.

1626
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Come there!

1627
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:26,280
A benefit match will be played.
Alok Prakash Charity. - Sir!

1628
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,560
All right then, 50,000.

1629
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:31,400
Take it, else we are leaving.
- Sir!

1630
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:32,880
50,000.00

1631
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:38,840
When this case started, I had
written an amount on a chit.

1632
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:40,400
Where is it?

1633
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:47,880
I had decided then, I won't accept
a penny less than that amount.

1634
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:50,320
You won't get even a
penny more than 50,000.

1635
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:53,600
60,000!

1636
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:55,960
60,000.00

1637
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:03,320
No, there's something else here.

1638
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:08,800
'Sports. Bombay's famous women's
hockey team, Gymkhana Club,'

1639
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:11,640
'has been disqualified from the
Tata Gold Cup tournament.'

1640
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,760
'The Gymkhana Club
captain, Neela,'

1641
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:15,800
'got into a fight
during a match.'

1642
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,640
'It's said she abused the
referee during the match'

1643
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:19,840
'and hit him with
a hockey stick.'

1644
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,680
'And when other girls from
the team intervened,'

1645
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,840
'she hit them too.'

1646
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,400
'One player's head is
seriously injured.'

1647
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:29,840
'Neela was arrested and
is now out on bail.'

1648
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,840
'Gymkhana Club manager
Peter Gonzalves said,'

1649
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:37,040
'disciplinary action will
be taken against Ms. Neela'

1650
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:40,280
'and she has been dismissed.
from the club indefinitely.'

1651
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,120
'In the third cricket test
against New Zealand,'

1652
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:47,040
'Pakistan scored 365 runs
in the first innings and..'

1653
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:48,800
Good that Neela
doesn't come here.

1654
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:01,040
Our last call is 550,000.

1655
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:13,200
Still not right. - God!

1656
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:19,280
Hello.
- Prem, did you watch the TV?

1657
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,320
Did you hear, what Neela did?

1658
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:23,840
She needs a good lawyer.

1659
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:27,160
Listen Alok, there are many
other lawyers in Bombay.

1660
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:29,480
And you are disturbing a lawyer,

1661
01:53:29,560 --> 01:53:32,760
..who is fighting your
case to death right now,

1662
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:34,520
I can't do anything for Neela.

1663
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:37,320
Damn! Try to understand.

1664
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:40,800
We are stuck with a
big fish right now.

1665
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:45,080
8?

1666
01:53:47,080 --> 01:53:47,640
7!

1667
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:52,560
What did Prem say?

1668
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:55,640
He's too busy. - He's right.

1669
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,960
I don't know why you're
sympathizing with her.

1670
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:05,240
Alok!

1671
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,280
Do you know why Neela
is in this state today?

1672
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:10,080
Why she's behaving crazily?

1673
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:11,800
Why are you worried?

1674
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,760
Shobha, I've lied to
you, I'm completely..

1675
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:20,280
Everything will be fine,
just sit down quietly.

1676
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:22,840
Why refuse wealth
coming your way?

1677
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:25,280
Just a few days more.

1678
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,160
We will build our
home all over again.

1679
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:30,840
Don't you want me to
fulfill my dreams.

1680
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:32,840
To become a top artist?

1681
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:42,760
Don't act silly, Alok,
think smart at least once.

1682
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:46,760
Please, just for me,
for a few more days.

1683
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:49,760
My darling.

1684
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:15,840
Mr. Magan.

1685
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,080
Mr. Magan.

1686
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:23,640
Mr. Magan, there is
a message for you.

1687
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:29,040
Your Labyrinth Plan has failed.
Flopped!

1688
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:32,760
Now pack your bags and
get going from here.

1689
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:36,840
Listen, your plan has failed.

1690
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:43,360
They know we are hiding here.
Let's go.

1691
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:47,560
No Johnny, we shouldn't
give up like this.

1692
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:51,160
I'll call up Mr. Rungta
and be right back.

1693
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:54,280
Just stay here, ok? And
keep doing all this.

1694
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:57,480
Good morning!

1695
01:55:57,560 --> 01:56:00,520
Get some champagne, some
whiskey, get ready for a party.

1696
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:01,800
Prem is everything done?

1697
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:05,520
Is this Mr. Alok Prakash's house?
- Tell me please.

1698
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:08,000
If this is really Mr.
Alok Prakash's house,

1699
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:12,960
..then I have a
cheque to give him.

1700
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:15,760
Rs. 1 million only.

1701
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,800
Prem!

1702
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:35,360
"Luck has smiled."

1703
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:38,640
"We are rich."

1704
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:44,680
"The trap, I had laid, has
netted a great catch."

1705
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:51,400
"It's raining money all over."

1706
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:57,120
"Not just 2, 4, 10 but
it's about a million."

1707
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,600
"Luck has smiled."

1708
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:02,600
"We are rich."

1709
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:08,920
"The trap, I had laid, has
netted a great catch."

1710
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:11,720
"Luck has smiled."

1711
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:33,640
"The dream that I
had seen once."

1712
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:40,000
"That the world will
swoon to my tunes."

1713
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:53,000
"Listening to my voice, this
world will dance crazily."

1714
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:58,800
"The dream that I
had seen once."

1715
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:44,240
"I'm the queen of tunes
and princess of songs."

1716
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,280
"I'm the life of
sweet melodies."

1717
01:58:57,080 --> 01:59:02,520
"I'm the queen of tunes
and princess of songs."

1718
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:08,520
"I'm the life of
sweet melodies."

1719
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:15,000
"I've lit many a
lamp with my songs.

1720
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:19,840
"I've caused rains
without clouds."

1721
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:27,320
"I'm the queen of tunes
and princess of songs."

1722
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,960
Once more.

1723
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:38,000
Thank you.

1724
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:53,120
"It's a beautiful day
that has brought joys."

1725
01:59:53,680 --> 01:59:59,080
"It's a beautiful day
that has brought joys."

1726
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:05,080
"It's my deeds that have
shown this miracle."

1727
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:11,080
"It's raining money all over."

1728
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:16,640
"Not just 2, 4, 10 but
it's about a million."

1729
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,800
"Luck has smiled."

1730
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,040
"We are rich."

1731
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:28,400
"The trap that I had laid,
has netted a great catch."

1732
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:48,800
I had promised to present it
to you on a marble platter.

1733
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,680
Now, I present it to you
on a silver platter.

1734
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,560
How did this happen?

1735
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,320
Because the plaintiff
Alok Prakash,

1736
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:00,640
..has withdrawn charges against
the accused, Midweek paper,

1737
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:03,080
..it's management and it's editor Mr.
Bharucha.

1738
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:06,160
On the condition that the accused
will pay the complainant,

1739
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:09,560
Alok Prakash a sum of Rs. 1
million as compensation.

1740
02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:13,000
1 million!

1741
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:15,680
I could've churned
out more from them.

1742
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:18,440
But it was already
3 in the morning.

1743
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:21,760
And that old Mr.
Rungta, began to cry.

1744
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:23,320
I pitied him.

1745
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,560
Actually, I can't bear to
see old people crying.

1746
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:28,200
I too feel like crying with joy.

1747
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:30,680
Look at the number of zeroes on this.
- Yes.

1748
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:33,760
Alok, what's it?

1749
02:01:34,600 --> 02:01:35,920
Smile, young lad.

1750
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:39,920
You've won the biggest
compensation in Bombay's history!

1751
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:43,160
And you're sulking here as
if you've lost everything.

1752
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,800
So what do I do? Dance like you?

1753
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
No way, not now.

1754
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:48,000
You're still not well.

1755
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:51,680
But in a week or two you'll
walk using crutches.

1756
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,400
And about a week or so later
you'll start walking with a stick.

1757
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:56,200
Why are you being so kind to me?

1758
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:59,600
So that you can go to
the bank very soon.

1759
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,680
Limping a little, then
take this cheque and..

1760
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:08,000
Shobha bring out some sweets.
- Yes, why not?

1761
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:11,560
Listen, come here. - Yes.

1762
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:14,920
Go.

1763
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:20,720
Mr. Rungta has compromised.

1764
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,000
Good riddance!

1765
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:24,920
I'm leaving to watch a movie.

1766
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:28,000
I haven't seen a movie for such a
long time. - What are you doing?

1767
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:29,680
Case closed. - No.

1768
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,080
I won't give up so easily.

1769
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,800
We have to accept it, sir.

1770
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:36,320
You're no match for Prem Sagar.

1771
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:39,600
He's a sly man. - Prem Sagar
is sly but Alok Prakash isn't.

1772
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:41,080
This is our last chance.

1773
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:43,000
Where are you going?

1774
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:45,000
To the opposite flat.

1775
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:49,960
You stay here, on the camera.
Shoot everything!

1776
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:57,760
Look Alok dear, you're now
an owner of a hefty sum.

1777
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,520
You should be more careful now.

1778
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,960
This world is full
of cheats and thugs.

1779
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:05,400
I know that.

1780
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:09,000
But you're lucky
because I'm with you.

1781
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:12,320
You must be thinking that
I'm a smart, great lawyer.

1782
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:16,680
But I'm a much smarter
and sharper businessman.

1783
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:18,720
I'll have to be even
more careful now.

1784
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:23,000
The greatest art in business
is to spread your money.

1785
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,560
Invest some in exports,
some in shares.

1786
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:29,680
But invest the
maximum in property.

1787
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,640
A lot can be adjusted there.

1788
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:34,800
Prem as for spreading the money,

1789
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:37,440
I want 50,000 too.

1790
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:40,000
So that I can use
this money to show,

1791
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:45,200
..there are stars other than Lata
Mangeshkar in the world of music.

1792
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:49,320
You're still
obsessed with films.

1793
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:51,120
This time I'll prove what I am.

1794
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:54,520
My songs will be premiered
in Shanmukhanand hall.

1795
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:56,400
The governor will inaugurate it.

1796
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,400
Lata Mangeshkar will be
called as the chief guest.

1797
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,480
And I'll have my P.R.O and secretary.
That's it!

1798
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,160
Producers, music directors
will make a queue for me.

1799
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:07,360
Yes and then silver disc,
golden disc, platinum disc.

1800
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:09,160
There'll be discs all over!

1801
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:12,080
Prem! - I'm afraid you may
end up with a slip disc.

1802
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:24,720
Detective Magan, welcome.

1803
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:26,840
Have you come alone?

1804
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:29,320
Haven't you brought the
pest control guys?

1805
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:35,320
May I go in for a minute?
- From here?

1806
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:38,720
I mean whenever you come you
either use the balcony,

1807
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:42,080
..else sometimes through
microphones in books.

1808
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:43,400
That chapter is now closed.

1809
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:48,200
If you permit, can I take my
stuff back? - With pleasure.

1810
02:04:56,400 --> 02:05:00,080
Mr. Magan, we are really sad
that your work is over.

1811
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,120
You were such a nice neighbour.

1812
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,600
You used to watch our
house round the clock.

1813
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:07,800
No thief could dare come here!

1814
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,240
I was just doing my job.

1815
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:14,440
I've no personal
enmity with anybody.

1816
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:16,720
But you see, Mr. Magan,

1817
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:20,920
..sometimes the clever fox
tries to jump for the grapes.

1818
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,960
And you know the
consequences of that.

1819
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:31,400
Any news about that hockey
player, Neela? - No!

1820
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,200
She learnt a good lesson.

1821
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:40,320
Girls have become
very rude these days.

1822
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,360
They don't respect anyone.

1823
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:45,720
Her captaincy had
gone to her head.

1824
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:53,280
Mr. Magan, enough of it.

1825
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:56,720
Out! - How can a lady hit a man?

1826
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,400
And that too a referee
as old as her father.

1827
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:00,720
What a shame?

1828
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:04,360
Only a cheap, snobbish
girl could do this.

1829
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:06,240
Thank god they threw her out.
- Idiot!

1830
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,800
One more word and I'll
slit your tongue.

1831
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:12,840
Thank you! - Alok!

1832
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:16,120
Well done Alok! Johnny!

1833
02:06:16,400 --> 02:06:18,000
You fell for his trap, you fool!
- Johnny!

1834
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:18,840
I'm the real fool.

1835
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:20,760
Had I leaked Alok's
secret to the media,

1836
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:22,760
I would've got Rs. 50,000!

1837
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:27,760
Johnny, did you take the picture?
- Yes boss!

1838
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,760
My camera was rolling.

1839
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:31,800
But since it's early morning, there
was little light in the room.

1840
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,520
Did you hear? It isn't
too late even now.

1841
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:36,240
Come. Sit down. Come, please.

1842
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:38,120
Get lost!

1843
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:40,320
Let's do it once more. - Yes.

1844
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:41,360
What are you doing, Alok?

1845
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,320
How much is the exposure?

1846
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:45,320
5.6! - Make it 2.8.

1847
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,360
Ok.

1848
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:48,320
And cut down the glare, right.

1849
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,960
Ready! - Yes.

1850
02:06:58,360 --> 02:06:59,400
These fingers are perfect!

1851
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:01,680
Now watch the magic of this leg.

1852
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:03,840
Keep the camera on.

1853
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:12,240
Got it? The leg is fine, right?

1854
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:13,560
Now watch the backbone.

1855
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:20,160
Backbone!
- Lift it, c'mon. Well done!

1856
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:22,640
This is a bit heavy.

1857
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:24,720
Pick this, lift the table.

1858
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:29,160
Well done! C'mon
lift it, very good!

1859
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:31,480
See my backbone!

1860
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:32,400
You see it too!

1861
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,360
See my backbone!

1862
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:38,520
Amazing! Alok please continue!

1863
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:41,920
Look at my backbone!

1864
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:06,840
Mr. Magan, did you get it?
Did you get what you wanted?

1865
02:08:08,360 --> 02:08:10,560
Prem, why don't
you do something?

1866
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:14,600
Alok has already
done everything.

1867
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:18,160
Sorry Shobha, you've
lost your 50,000.

1868
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,640
God saved Lata Mangeshkar!

1869
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:23,240
Now you become a chorus singer.

1870
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:27,360
I was such a fool to come here!

1871
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:29,840
You wanted to leak
my secret, right?

1872
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:31,160
But your secret is out.

1873
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:34,120
I don't need you anymore.
Get lost from here!

1874
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:34,960
No, wait!

1875
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:41,800
See this? Take this!

1876
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:44,840
Now leave! Get lost from here!

1877
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:48,400
My music!

1878
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:57,640
Sorry genius!

1879
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:00,480
I'm sorry to have
spoilt your party.

1880
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:03,280
Not at all.

1881
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:07,000
I'll trap someone else.

1882
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,400
Young lad, do one thing.

1883
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:15,520
Use this car today.

1884
02:09:16,240 --> 02:09:17,280
They will take it tomorrow.

1885
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:22,240
And find her, find Neela.
She's the right one for you.

1886
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:26,600
We've done great injustice
to the poor girl.

1887
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,560
And if possible, apologize
to her on my behalf too.

1888
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:35,640
Take it.

1889
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:38,960
For the first time,
I feel that maybe,

1890
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,120
..my sister married
the right man.

1891
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:46,600
Your sister has married
the right man,

1892
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:50,800
..but how the hell did I
land up with these people!

1893
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,840
Wait, Magan!

1894
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:59,640
The game is over but
the work isn't.

1895
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:02,040
I've something to say.
Switch on the camera.

1896
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:05,320
Roll it, let's do him a favour.

1897
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:07,120
How clever he thought he was.

1898
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:15,200
I, Prem Sagar, advocate, B.A.L.L.B
want to make a statement.

1899
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:19,120
I'm shocked and surprised,
my client is ditching me.

1900
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:23,360
But my client Alok Prakash can't
be charged for any legal offence,

1901
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:26,240
..because in this case there
wasn't any exchange of money.

1902
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:35,280
But the owner of Midweek News, Mr.
Rungta,

1903
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:37,120
..it's editor Mr. Bharucha

1904
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:39,560
..and also their lawyer Desai
have gone against the law.

1905
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:43,280
They've intruded into my
client's private affairs.

1906
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:47,120
This is an offence under Indian
penal code, section 365.

1907
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:50,160
Therefore, these three should
be legally prosecuted.

1908
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:53,960
Moreover I'll appeal to
the collector of Bombay,

1909
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:58,520
..to issue an order to cancel the
license of one detective Mr. Magan.

1910
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,800
Mr. Magan has not only
helped the three accused,

1911
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:06,320
..but also stained the
image of the poor.

1912
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:10,800
By insulting Ms. Neela, he
has insulted womankind.

1913
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:14,160
This isn't just against
the Indian constitution,

1914
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:17,560
..but also against the United
Nations' Human Rights' Division's,

1915
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:19,360
..Civil Rights Commission,

1916
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:20,960
..which is approved by
the Indian government.

1917
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:24,800
And also International Vigilance
Committee For Civil Liberties,

1918
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:26,800
ICVKP organization..

1919
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:51,800
Why are you lighting
the match stick.

1920
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:55,360
Today a grand benefit match,

1921
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:57,800
…was to be played here
to honour my friend.

1922
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:07,560
Remember, what you had said to
that friend at the hospital?

1923
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:10,920
Anyone who lies should
be taught a good lesson.

1924
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,800
Alok Prakash is a
liar, he's a fraud.

1925
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:21,000
Teach him a good lesson.

1926
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:22,920
Why did you do it?

1927
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:25,480
Why?

1928
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:27,400
For the sake of money.

1929
02:12:28,120 --> 02:12:29,280
You're lying.

1930
02:12:29,800 --> 02:12:31,040
If it was for money,

1931
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:34,200
..why did you leave the
wheel chair and come here?

1932
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:38,000
Because I started
hating that atmosphere.

1933
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:40,000
I despise those characters.

1934
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:44,240
And Neela, I hate myself.

1935
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:47,360
Here, do what you want.

1936
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:51,080
Do I put on a collar and
seat you on a wheelchair?

1937
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,960
No, I can't do it.

1938
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:01,240
Where are you going
leaving all this.

1939
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:04,360
I don't know but no
more hockey for me.

1940
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,600
Don't be disheartened.
You're known name in hockey.

1941
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:10,400
You're the captain of your club.
You're a good player too.

1942
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:11,760
I used to be.

1943
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:14,120
But not anymore.
- How can you say that?

1944
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,400
While playing, when
people taunt you,

1945
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:19,400
..it's wise to leave the game.

1946
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:22,360
Neela, I'm sure you
must have played badly.

1947
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:25,480
Certainly! Your mind is always
bogged down by my accident.

1948
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,720
Whatever it is but
no hockey for me.

1949
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:29,480
So what will you do now, Neela?

1950
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:32,680
Anything but not hockey.

1951
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,000
I must leave, I'm
leaving Bombay today.

1952
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:12,800
Neela,

1953
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:15,240
..give it to me.

1954
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:49,480
What happened?

1955
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,600
Alok!

1956
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:56,520
The phone is ringing, why
is no one picking it?

1957
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:57,520
Phone?

1958
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:00,160
Yes, phone, can't you hear?

1959
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:02,480
There is no phone here?

1960
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:06,080
How many of me can you see?

1961
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:07,920
Two!

1962
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,120
Two?

1963
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:13,080
One Neela who's the
Gymkhana Club's captain.

1964
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:16,960
And the other foolish girl,
who is leaving Bombay.

1965
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,840
Now will you go for the hockey
practice from tomorrow?

1966
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:26,960
And you wouldn't leave Bombay too?
- No.

1967
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:29,600
And you'll come to my
house from tomorrow?

1968
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
What?
- Shobha has left my house.

1969
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:34,360
Forever! - But..

1970
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:37,960
Neela, we got
divorced ages back.

1971
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,320
And now.. - And now?

1972
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
And now, I can't live
without you, Neela.
