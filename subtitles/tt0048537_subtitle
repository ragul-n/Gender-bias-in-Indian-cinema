3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:15,350
Through hamlets and settlements,
hills and vales, wanders a gypsy singing

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,660
To the accompaniment
of his heart's music

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,920
We journey but a
short while together

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,860
Our friendships bound by time

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,010
If we tarry today, we must prepare
for a journey on the morrow

8
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:31,740
The Fates sit, spreading
their snares at every step

9
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:43,720
Who will be left behind on
this journey of life, no one knows

10
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,940
Through hamlets and settlements,
hills and vales, wanders a gypsy singing

11
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,150
To the accompaniment
of his heart's music

12
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,290
Why is this world crazy
for wealth and riches?

13
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:26,666
Material riches must be left behind;
it cannot be carried into the afterlife

14
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,610
Through hamlets and settlements,
hills and vales, wanders a gypsy singing

15
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,750
To the accompaniment
of his heart's music

16
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,190
Aah, bravo, sir, bravo!
You speak the honest truth.

17
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,490
- Material wealth will remain here.
- You speak the truth, sir.

18
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,890
But, these days,
who believes in this?

19
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,810
When my daughter got engaged...

20
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,650
- her in-laws asked for Rs.5,000 as dowry.
- Good God!

21
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,120
- Vimala is awake!
- So what am I to do?

22
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,810
Where's the money coming from?
How will this wedding take place?

23
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,440
- We'll sell the house.
- Hmph! Sell the house!

24
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,300
Sir, they were very young
when their father died.

25
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,420
I sold all my jewelry
to educate him...

26
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,940
in the hope that our troubles would end.
But he hasn't got a job yet.

27
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,840
Now, if we sell our house,
where will we stay? On the road?

28
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,880
- That's true, sir.
- Don't worry, mother, everything will be okay.

29
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,880
- What will be okay?
- Yes, mother...

30
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,970
this world is filled with troubles.

31
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,800
- May God save us.
- Praise be to God.

32
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,120
- Hey, you keep falling over me!
- My dear, come over to this side.

33
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,060
- Can't I sit in my seat?
- Now you can rest peacefully, my dear.

34
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,810
Lie down... sleep...

35
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,776
- Sir, please move a little...
- What? Let me sleep. - Let me sit.

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,740
Thank you!
You did us a favor.

37
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,470
Dear sir, I'm definitely
older than you.

38
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,240
I'm sixty years old.

39
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,650
- And you must be 20? 22?
- He's 22. - 22 years old.

40
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,990
I'm a dhobhi (washerman)
by profession.

41
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,870
But I earn a monthly
income of Rs.200.

42
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,860
- And you have no job?
- None at all.

43
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,450
So I earn more than you, too.

44
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,470
So let me ask you one thing, friend.
How can you address me thus?

45
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,080
As it is, I gave your sister
some space...

46
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,740
and just because you've learned
a few words of English...

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,060
you have forgotten your culture?

48
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,670
- [Murmuring Lord Ram's name.]
- Ram, apologize to him.

49
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,720
- Go on... Apologize!
- It was a mistake, sir. Please forgive me.

50
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,930
Bless you, my son. This is the
influence of our culture. Bless you.

51
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,090
Bless you.
Hey, can't you sit properly?

52
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,240
- Ram! Hey, Ram!
- Hmm?

53
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,626
Go, have a look outside. Find out why
the train has been stationary for so long.

54
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,410
- Huh?
- The train has stopped here awhile.

55
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,800
- Get up! Get up, the train has stopped.
- The train has stopped? - Yes.

56
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,540
Yes, you!

57
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,310
My dear sir, Beauty is calling you!

58
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,040
- Tell me, memsaab!
- Can you tell me why the train has stopped?

59
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,950
A hen has laid eggs
on the railway tracks.

60
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,070
- The train will move when the eggs are removed.
- Why haven't they done so yet?

61
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,250
Wow, memsaab! How
intelligent you must be!

62
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,410
- You're very rude.
- Really? Wow!

63
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,350
You are quite impolite yourself,
and I'm the rude one?

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,200
You're mannerless!

65
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,090
Can Beauty ever be mannerless?

66
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,260
Memsaab! The world will always
total two and two to make four.

67
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,940
And that's why they are
miserable. Look here...

68
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,670
I add two and two and make it 22.
I'm happy and content.

69
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,730
He was saying
Beauty is mannerless.

70
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,600
- Oh, shut up!
- Memsaab also adds two and two to make four.

71
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,120
- Your highness! Your highness!
- What is it?

72
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,370
My liege, the princess is not in her room.
I found this letter on her bed.

73
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,830
I'm leaving this house forever.

74
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,120
I detest the groom you have
chosen for me.

75
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,900
I'm sorry I could not
obey your orders.

76
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,440
Your unfortunate lndira.

77
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,700
Hello? Hello? Controller?

78
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,360
- Station master speaking.
- Hey, master!

79
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,010
What's happened? Why has
the train stopped here?

80
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,050
Be patient.
I'll tell you the reason.

81
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,900
- Tell me.
- The train has stopped because... - Sir! Sir!

82
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,116
- Why has the train halted?
- That's what I was explaining...

83
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,400
- The train has stopped because...
- Hey, sir!

84
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,316
- Oh! - Why has the train stopped?
- Lala, that's just what I was explaining.

85
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,060
- The train has stopped because...
- Master!

86
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,400
Khansaab, why are you
blocking the way?

87
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,910
May I ask why the train
has halted here?

88
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,360
Sethji, that's just what I was
explaining to these people!

89
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,640
- The train has been stopped because...
- Station master!

90
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,390
- Yes, madam?
- Why has the train stopped?

91
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,860
Oh, oh... first of all, all of you
come together.

92
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,936
- Then I'll tell you.
- "Why has the train stopped?"

93
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,460
- Shut up!
- What're you doing?

94
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,440
- Masterji!
- What?

95
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,500
Listen to me...

96
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,356
- First, gather everyone together. Then I'll tell you.
- Alright.

97
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,180
I'll gather everyone around.
Please come here.

98
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,210
Listen, sir, don't interrupt.

99
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,160
- Of course!
- Khansaab, please hold the door.

100
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,986
- Uh? - Don't let anyone come in.
- Oh.

101
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,020
If anyone talks now, I'll not
say anything. [lndecipherable]

102
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,460
The fact is... that...

103
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,830
- at the next station...
- Station master!

104
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,229
- Oh ho ho... - Why has the train...
- Good lord! - What...

105
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,166
- Tell us quickly, master.
- Be quick!

106
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,290
- Oh, my! The train has
stopped because...

107
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,840
a river is in spate just before
the next station.

108
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,346
The railway tracks are
submerged in water.

109
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,590
So the train won't
proceed any further.

110
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,486
Station master, for how long will
the train be held up here?

111
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,410
For as long as the river
is in spate.

112
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,266
- And how long will that be?
- How can I answer that?

113
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,620
- Am I...?
- Excuse me, madam.

114
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,470
W... O...

115
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,250
R... K...

116
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,770
Work...

117
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,020
P... R...

118
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,300
O...

119
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,660
Progressing...

120
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,800
- 24 hours?
- Oh, God! Damn it!

121
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,180
- Excuse me, young man? - Yes?
- You know how to send cables?

122
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,180
- Yes, I do.
- Hey, station master! - Yes?

123
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,170
- Will we have to stay here for a few days?
- Perhaps.

124
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,276
- 24 hours?
- Oh, damn it!

125
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,060
[lndecipherable] - It's the wedding
of my old friend's dog...

126
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,230
and I'm invited there. I've to
reach the venue by evening.

127
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,400
So what can I do?
What can I do?

128
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,390
- And then?
- I learned it for a job, but I didn't get the post.

129
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,390
- Very good, very good!
- Move back, excuse me, please...

130
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,690
Well, station master. I've to reach
Bombay by tomorrow morning.

131
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,400
It's the test match between
India and the West lndies.

132
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,650
- Did you know Lala Amarnath is the captain?
- No.

133
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,960
- You don't know?
- Certainly, no.

134
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,680
- No?
- No!

135
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,190
But for me, it's a job at stake.

136
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,410
How will I get the job
if I don't reach by tomorrow?

137
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,690
- Do you have a recommendation?
- Then, you won't get the job.

138
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,410
This is Andher Nagri. You can't get a
job here without a recommendation.

139
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,150
- Arre, yes, sir! This is indeed
'Andher Nagri' [Dark Kingdom].

140
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,380
Why else would
the train halt here?

141
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,210
Arre, Master!
Where shall we stay?

142
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,080
- On the platform?
- Yes, sir, yes!

143
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,360
What arrangements have you made
for us, first-class passengers?

144
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,040
- What?
- Isn't there a waiting room here?

145
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,750
- No, madam. - No?
- No, sir.

146
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,580
- Then where will we stay?
- You could stay in your own cabins.

147
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,900
- But the fans don't work there, nor is there any water.
- Yes!

148
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,390
Then, perhaps, you could
stay on the platform...

149
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,336
- like these people.
- On the platform?

150
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,330
- Oh, no! - On the platform!
- Excellent, my dear sir!

151
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,290
You've made us very happy today.

152
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,410
Rich and poor will stay together
for a day, at the very least.

153
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,310
- Why do you blabber so much?
- Why are you so angry, memsaab?

154
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,990
- You can stay just like us.
- Look, mister...

155
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,100
by a stroke of good fortune,
Life has been extremely kind to us.

156
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,870
We're deemed the best.

157
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,540
The luxuries of the world are
ours for the asking.

158
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,210
And so, we cannot stay
on the platform with you.

159
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,020
Understood?

160
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,300
- Sir?
- Yes, madam?

161
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,570
- So what arrangements can be made for us?
- What?

162
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,920
- Station master saab, the arrangements
for the 'best' people will continue...

163
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,260
but tell us if there's any
provision for meals here?

164
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,340
No, young man. There's neither
a store at the station nor a well.

165
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,530
- Not even a well?
- No.

166
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,546
We have to stay here for 24 hours
and you can't even provide water?

167
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,890
- I'm very sorry!
- This really is Andher Nagri!

168
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,220
What do you mean? This place
is not a part of Andher Nagri.

169
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,670
No, madam. This is
the last station in this state.

170
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,930
And the King is our Sovereign.

171
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,770
Wow!

172
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,140
- Station master saab?
- Yes?

173
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,790
Just as this state is named
Andher Nagri [Dark Kingdom]...

174
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,360
if the king is named 'Chaupat Raja'...
[confused/chaotic; an old Hindi idiom]...

175
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,250
- Excuse me, Station master saab.
- What is it?

176
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,430
What arrangements can be made
for our meals?

177
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,890
There's a shop about a furlong,
a furlong-and-a-half from here...

178
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,910
with a well on the premises. That's
where you will find something to eat.

179
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,480
- Nihal Chand?
- Yes, Naseeb Chand?

180
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,880
- What are these people doing?
- They're arguing.

181
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,160
The trader's ears are tingling.

182
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,810
You're an idiot!

183
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,040
Look, there's only
one shop here...

184
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,910
and only one well.
And trader?

185
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,570
Brilliant! Go quickly and
get my bag of money.

186
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,510
But of what use
is your money here?

187
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,720
- You fool, for business, of course.
- Business? - Yes.

188
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,060
Wow, my Lord, wow!

189
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,260
When you deign to be bountiful,
your benevolence is limitless.

190
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,490
You just doubled my profit.

191
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,260
Oh, my!

192
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,230
Oh, never mind, it's nothing.
This was a good omen.

193
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,646
What do you want? Gram dal,
puffed rice, savories, snacks, sweets?

194
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,870
- What do you want?
- What's that in those bags?

195
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,160
- Huh? Wheat, rice, millet...
- Alright, alright, that's enough.

196
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,070
- What do you want? - I want everything.
- Everything? Oh, my!

197
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,950
- Wait, let me call father.
- Okay.

198
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,540
Father, here! Hey, why are you
spoiling our goods?

199
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,570
- Spoiling? I'm only tasting...
- No such thing is allowed here.

200
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,666
- You will have to pay me 1 paisa.
- What? I'm here to do a lot of business...

201
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,410
A lot of business! I don't want
to trade with you. Pay up 1 paisa.

202
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,190
Pay up indeed! Here...
here you go, 1 paisa.

203
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,780
You think I'm stupid?

204
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,610
Here! One... two... three...

205
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,100
- [lndecipherable] - No!
- What is it, my dear?

206
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,490
Oh, sir! This shop
belongs to you?

207
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,010
- It belongs to God.
- How wonderful!

208
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,090
- Do you want to sell?
- Of course not!

209
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,340
I don't want to sell the shop.
It's my pride and joy.

210
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,360
- Heard that?
- Yes, I did.

211
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,530
And that's okay. It's not as if
I want it forever.

212
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,050
- I want it for one day.
- For one day?

213
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,050
It might go a few hours over that,
but I'll pay good money.

214
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,690
- Lots of money?
- Yes.

215
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,160
- Whose well is that?
- It belongs to us.

216
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,476
- Arre, Nihal Chand!
- I'm coming!

217
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,310
Come quickly.
The situation is warming up.

218
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,710
Coming, sir, coming!

219
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,880
Alright, does the well have water,
or is it dry?

220
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,500
Father, what sort of
a businessman is he?

221
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,250
Hey, sir, how can it be a well
if it has no water?

222
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,430
- It was a mistake.
- Yes, it was.

223
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,950
- Okay, this well, and the shop including its contents...
- Yes?

224
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,870
The well, the shop
with all its contents...

225
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,530
To rent these for
one day and one night...

226
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:42,440
- What should we offer, Nihal Chand?
- Er... Rs.150. - Rs.150?

227
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,880
- How much is that?
- 150 is 150.150.

228
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,270
- One phitee?
- No, no, no, Not 'one phitee'.

229
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,860
- Not one phitee. - Huh?
- One hundred and fifty.

230
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,250
- I think she's illiterate.
- One hundred and fifty. - You're right!

231
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,510
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8... 20...
20... how many twenties?

232
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,000
- How many twenties?
- You do the Math, Nihal Chand.

233
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,680
- 7 twenties, sir.
- Ah. Oh.

234
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,090
- He seems smart.
- 7 twenties.

235
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,730
- 7 twenties? - Yes.
- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7...

236
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,926
- 7 twenties? - Yes.
- 7 twenties? - 7 twenties!

237
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,370
Oh my! Of course we'll rent
it to you! Give me the money!

238
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,830
- Ah, Nihal Chand... - Yes, sir?
- Count the money; I'll just be back.

239
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,100
- Hey, I'm giving you the amount, take it.
- Give me the money. - Here.

240
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,420
Nihal Chand!

241
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,440
- Get their thumb impressions on stamp paper.
- You're absolutely right.

242
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,580
1,2,3,4,5, and this is 6,
and this, 7.

243
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,570
Hey, sir, you need to
sign some papers.

244
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,440
Oh, yes, sir. I'm coming.

245
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,750
- Father! - Hmm?
- Shut the door.

246
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,580
- Where shall we hide it?
- Yes, where?

247
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,150
- Shut the window, father!
- Yes.

248
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,480
Father... open this!

249
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,750
Here...

250
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,969
- Mother! Mother...
- Uh?

251
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,490
That's the well, and there's food
too; so keep our belongings here.

252
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,490
- Hey, Dudhiya's mother...
- Give it here... [cross-talk]

253
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,136
[Cross-talk continues.]

254
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,936
Be quick, what are you
waiting for? Come quickly.

255
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,010
- Pass it here, pass it... slowly..
- Get down slowly...

256
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,590
Take care, sethji... your daughter is
tripping because she's over-burdened.

257
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,500
Hey, she may be your daughter!

258
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,330
She's my wife.

259
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,850
What ill-mannered louts! Laughing
at another man's wife!

260
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,940
I spent Rs.700
on the wedding; 700!

261
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,580
Come, my dear... come.

262
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,820
When man is a demon, then...

263
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,510
he can be bought
in the marketplace

264
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:36,700
Even man has been sold here
in exchange for wealth

265
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,820
- Bravo!
- Bravo! - Wow!

266
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,880
Mother, the seth is a crook...

267
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,530
but this child's parents
must be shot...

268
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,580
for entrusting this innocent girl
to this old fogey.

269
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,430
Don't say that, Ram.

270
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,850
Only the parents of a girl know
the difficulties. Come, Vimala.

271
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,780
Here, take this. It's okay,
I'll take it with me.

272
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,910
Nihal Chandji!

273
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,860
Oh, Nihal Chand!

274
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,510
- Yes, Naseeb Chandji.
- Where were you?

275
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,370
Please help with my luggage!

276
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,170
- I'm coming...
- Uh-huh.

277
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,790
Hey, why're you going there?

278
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,350
I'm going to help with
the baggage, Naseeb Chandji.

279
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,320
I'll help with
my wife's luggage.

280
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,270
You help with my luggage.

281
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,080
- Be careful, don't let it fall.
- It's very heavy. - Yes.

282
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,570
Bedding... hey,
what are you doing?

283
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,180
The box...

284
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,780
This bundle is very heavy.

285
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,180
Give it to me.

286
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,180
You must be tired, my dear.

287
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,830
Come, let me wait upon you.

288
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,530
I should be waiting upon you.

289
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,180
You really are [Goddess] Lakshmi!

290
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,890
- Oh my!
- Uh-oh.

291
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,600
- Er, what's your name?
- Naina.

292
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,290
Naina? Please take your
bhabhi [sister-in-law] inside.

293
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,330
Go, my dear.

294
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,640
You're a child!

295
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,760
- Father? Father...
- Yes?

296
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,940
She says God decides
your husband when you are born?

297
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,480
Yes, my dear.
That's true.

298
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,330
- Sir? - Huh?
- Where are we running off to?

299
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,556
- Let's unload our belongings here.
- Yes, let's do that.

300
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,990
- What about here?
- Okay. - Yes.

301
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,810
What are you staring at? Have you
brought the world with you?

302
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,536
- He'll come...
- He's sleeping in the compartment.

303
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,010
- Sit, sit...
- Ram, dear, please get some water for us to freshen up.

304
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,410
- Alright.

305
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,730
A fair damsel is bathing

306
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:48,480
A pure stream of cold water

307
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,590
caresses her silver limbs

308
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:03,870
- and one desires to embrace her...
- Bravo! - Bravo!

309
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,586
- Bravo! - Ah, wow!
- My God! What a shameless wretch? - lndeed.

310
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,800
- Listen to those obscene lyrics!
- Yes, indeed they are! Wretch! - Look here!

311
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:20,030
Embarrassed, the fair damsel
shrinks away

312
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,940
The stream offers its respects

313
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,930
as the fair damsel bathes

314
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,600
- What's this nonsense you're spouting?
- Huh?

315
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,310
- Nonsense?
- What's this if not nonsense?

316
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,896
It's poetry. Poetry in
praise of beauty.

317
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,780
You're the limit! You see a young
girl there and say, 'Beauty is calling.'

318
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,540
And here, you see a young woman
bathing and start reciting poetry?

319
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,770
I'm a worshipper of beauty.

320
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,576
Oh, so every time you see a
young, beautiful woman...

321
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,770
- you will recite poetry, will you?
- Perhaps.

322
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,010
So get out of here. Can't you see there
are mothers and sisters sitting there?

323
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,030
They are my mothers
and sisters too.

324
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,636
You don't recite obscene poetry
about mothers and sisters.

325
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,480
Come on, get up.
Get up!

326
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,350
Truly, you folks can only add
two and two to make four.

327
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,500
- If two and two don't make four, what's the answer?
- It can be 22.

328
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,006
And when you folks
understand this...

329
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,360
then this world will
always seem beautiful.

330
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,200
Mad fellow!

331
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,390
Er... some water?

332
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,550
Hey, what are you doing?

333
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,580
I didn't buy the store and the well
to give things away for free.

334
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,920
Sir, please give me the money
for the water.

335
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,450
- Money for the water?
- What else?

336
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,820
I gave you Rs.150 in cash.

337
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,630
I'm charging only
1 paise per glass...

338
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,110
but as the day progresses,
the cost of water will increase.

339
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,790
You'll sell water?

340
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,780
[Exclaims.]

341
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,700
You'll sell water? Aren't you ashamed
to sell water in the black market?

342
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,300
Where's the shame in business?
I've given her Rs.150.

343
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,330
Shouldn't I recoup
my investment?

344
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,440
You dug this well so people
could quench their thirst.

345
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,140
But this seth is selling water.

346
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,970
These city slickers are impossible.

347
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,230
This was a big mistake, my dear.
Now, what do we do?

348
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,780
We don't need his money.
We'll return it.

349
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,340
Yes, alright.

350
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,210
Listen... I need
five or six men...

351
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,030
to wash vessels, sweep floors,
knead dough and draw water.

352
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,486
Whoever is willing to work,
they'll get food and water for free.

353
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,600
- I'm ready! - So am I.
- I'm ready too.

354
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,200
Ah, that's good!

355
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,950
Sir, if you will work, then
you will also get free water.

356
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,790
Hey, I'm not
your father's servant.

357
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,500
- If you can't work, then give me the money.
- Here's your money!

358
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,700
- What?
- We don't want to sell.

359
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,210
But you've already sold it.

360
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,690
But I'm returning your money.
Go away from here.

361
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,740
But... but I don't want
your money. Take it.

362
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,190
- Hey, aren't you going to get lost?
- No, I won't go.

363
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,490
I've made a deal. Aren't there
laws and justice?

364
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,426
- Does your father own the law?
- Not my father, no...

365
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,670
but her father did put his thumb
impression on stamp paper.

366
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,600
- So doesn't that mean it's legal?
- What's legal?

367
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,430
The law? It's the stamp paper,
court, magistrate...

368
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,870
Bravo, government! It's good
you made an airtight law...

369
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,270
or else, if there were three or
four others like him...

370
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,741
this poor man's business would have
shut down immediately.

371
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,030
You trick innocents into signing on
stamp paper, only to threaten them?

372
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,270
- You thieving scoundrel!
- Hey! - Ram!

373
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,240
Move aside!
What are you doing? Hey!

374
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,676
He's making arrangements to
go to jail; he's breaking the law.

375
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,510
I'll surely go to jail, but I'll break your
head so it will benefit all these folks.

376
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,750
So let 'all these people' speak. Why are
you the only one protesting? Come away.

377
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,620
He's a hot-blooded young man;
obviously, he's short-tempered.

378
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,666
- Mother, he's trying to loot everyone.
- Okay. Come!

379
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,280
Hey, am I trying to hoard water?
I'm only selling it!

380
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,140
Here, take your money.

381
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,390
Er... sir!

382
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,160
If you don't have money, and you don't
want to work, bring me something.

383
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,456
I want to do business.

384
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,250
Wow! "I want to
do business!" lndeed!

385
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,720
Sell water? That's
your business? Hmph!

386
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,746
- He'll sell well water? What sort of a business is this?
- Lala, water will be sold.

387
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,186
And sethji, so long as we tolerate this,
your business will prosper.

388
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,470
- Oh, wow! - it will prosper!
- Wow, indeed.

389
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,620
- What did he say?
- Huh? He spoke the truth.

390
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,020
- Hey, get lost! Go to the jungle with your lota.
- Oh, wow! Thank you, seth!

391
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,010
- Hmm, hmm... go without water!
- Uff oh!

392
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,200
- Memsaab! Memsaab!
- Yes, Mary?

393
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,130
- Give me money to buy water.
- Give you money to buy water?

394
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,690
- You have to buy water here.
- Water is being sold?

395
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,690
- Darling?
- Yes?

396
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,420
Look at her!
Water is being sold?

397
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,590
- Water is being sold?
- Yes, sir!

398
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,850
Why worry? If water is
being sold, we'll drink beer.

399
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,500
- Of course! - Yes!
- I've a lot of beer. - Hear, hear!

400
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,070
- You guys have beer and whisky, right?
- Yes!

401
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,880
Brilliant! Then we will have
a fabulous picnic!

402
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,860
- Er, isn't that so, Mrs. Kapoor?
- Yes! - Of course!

403
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,190
What a scoundrel your husband is,
my dear! He's selling water.

404
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,640
Why are you covering your ears?

405
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,250
Mother said I shouldn't listen
to any criticism of my husband.

406
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,340
- Where are you going, my dear?
- Look, father...

407
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,566
- if someone leaves our home still thirsty, that's not right.
- Of course not!

408
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,770
- So let me give that young man some water.
- Huh? - Okay, go.

409
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,100
Hey, girl!

410
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,390
Hey, I'm warning you,
don't take any water.

411
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,230
- I will take some.
- And I warn you not to ruin my business!

412
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,550
- Ruin your business!
- This water belongs to me.

413
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,680
Yours? I brought this water
from my house.

414
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,420
- I bought everything!
- Including everything that's in my house?

415
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,620
Yes, yes, yes! Don't break the law;
I'll send you to jail!

416
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,900
Send me to jail indeed! Let me tell you,
I will take this water. I will, I will...

417
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,370
[Screams] Oh, God!
The girl is dead!

418
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,466
Someone help her!
Oh, what shall I do?

419
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,530
- Oh, Nihal Chand! Come...
- My Naina! Naina!

420
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,300
Help! Someone, help!

421
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,650
- Help!
- Help! Someone, save the girl!

422
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Help! Help!

423
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,010
Help! Help!

424
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,950
Help! Save the girl!

425
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:45,990
[Confused shouts and exclamations.]

426
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,800
- Bhaiyya! [Brother!]
- Ram!

427
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,890
Ram! In the well!
Oh, Ram!

428
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,420
- [Shouts continue in the background.]
- My dear! My daughter!

429
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,400
[Muffled voices in the background.]
Ram!

430
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,410
[Shouts continue.] Someone hold him.
Help him!

431
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,910
Ram! Someone help him!
Save him!

432
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,520
- Leave him!
- Help!

433
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,266
Hey, old man!
Are you listening?

434
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,760
[Muffled shouts and
exclamations continue.]

435
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,240
Oh, I'm dead!

436
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,540
- Oh, God!
- Praise the lord!

437
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,270
Throw a rope!

438
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,610
Quick! Bring a rope.

439
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,500
- Bring a rope!
- Quickly! Where's the rope? - Bring it here.

440
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,280
[Muffled shouts.]

441
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,680
- Here...
- Hey, you! Catch!

442
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,840
[Muffled shouts continue.]

443
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,300
Hold on tightly. Okay? I won't
save you if you slip again.

444
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,240
Excellent! Excellent!
Tightly, alright?

445
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,610
Tighter! [Lots of shouting
in the background.]

446
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,170
Pull!

447
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,380
[Muffled discussion
in the background.]

448
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,210
Vimala! Look!
Look, Vimala!

449
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,760
- Careful! - Sir, sir... hold tight!
- Pull! Pull!

450
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,660
Think of God and pull strongly!

451
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,600
Well, my dear?
Feeling alright?

452
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,370
- Yes.
- Sister, it wasn't his fault.

453
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,310
- My dear, the gentleman is here.
- Huh?

454
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,970
Shouldn't you thank him?
He saved your life.

455
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,740
Yes...

456
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,190
Thank him, my dear.

457
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,070
- No, no!
- Get up, my dear.

458
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,820
- Come, Ram, change your clothes.
- Let's go, mother.

459
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,330
Mother... please accept the hospitality
of this humble hut today.

460
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,590
No. Why would you
trouble yourself?

461
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,660
Even Lord Ram partook of a
forest dweller's offering of berries.

462
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,650
Alright. We'll come for dinner.

463
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,630
- Come, dear.
- Yes, mother.

464
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,480
Hey, do you know my brother's
name is also Ram?

465
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,400
And do you know why she
served Ram berries?

466
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:56,220
- Why?
- Because she was in love with Ram.

467
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,190
- How is she?
- Who?

468
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,890
- She...
- The bathing beauty?

469
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,740
You pretend to be a great lover.

470
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,840
'Beauty is calling to you',
'The fair damsel is bathing...'

471
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,880
but when the fair damsel fell
into the well, you could only yell.

472
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,930
- Why didn't you jump in?
- Perhaps it was my helplessness.

473
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,430
- And what's that?
- What can I say?

474
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,590
You look hale and hearty...

475
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,660
why don't you just admit
you're a coward?

476
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,500
Dudhiya's father...

477
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,370
we can manage without food for a day,
but how will we manage without water?

478
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,430
They have put a price
on water here.

479
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:43,236
My dear, we workers can always
subsist doing some job or the other.

480
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,120
Hey, is anyone there?

481
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,000
- Anyone there?
- Listen, brother, go do his bidding and earn some money.

482
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,850
Go... go quickly.

483
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,780
See? The seth hired
a few workers...

484
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,590
and some have taken up
odd jobs. Yes?

485
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,110
How are we affected?

486
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,420
It's these brown sahebs who
find themselves in trouble.

487
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,430
They are educated in English...

488
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,010
so they can neither work
as laborers...

489
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,520
nor do they possess
the wealth of the rich.

490
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,070
Like Trishanku [a mythological king],
they are left hanging helplessly.

491
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,980
- Hey, what are you saying?
- Ah, dear sir...

492
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,280
Bravo!

493
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,460
You cleverly used the term 'Trishanku'
to define the educated middle class.

494
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,280
Not grounded on earth,
nor soaring in the skies...

495
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,160
they only hover in between.

496
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,930
Yes, sir, they are indeed
Trishankus.

497
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,060
[Indistinct conversation.]

498
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,916
- Come quickly, Danny.
- Take this luggage. - Here, sir.

499
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,720
- Yes?
- I'm Mr. Kapoor.

500
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,260
- You are...?
I'm Miss Singh, Sheela Singh.

501
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,690
Oh. Miss Sheela Singh,
will you come with us?

502
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,400
It'll be a great picnic.

503
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,970
- I'll come later.
- Do come.

504
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,170
Yes? Please. Please?

505
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,900
Come on!

506
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,360
Tell me, what does your
brother like to eat?

507
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,619
- He likes everything.
- Everything? - Yes.

508
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,759
Will he eat dal-baati? [Lentils and
hard bread.] - Yes. Why not?

509
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,960
Your brother is very nice.

510
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,740
Friend, has he ever saved
anyone's life before this?

511
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,629
Yes. Once, a fledgling had
fallen off its nest...

512
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,980
and he picked it up and
put it back.

513
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,629
Your brother is
truly compassionate.

514
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,340
Listen, Vimala, when I fell
into the well...

515
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,730
he said, "Hold me tight.

516
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,800
If you slip again,
I'll not rescue you."

517
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:57,059
So, Vimala, I held onto him
very tightly indeed.

518
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,780
Tightly.

519
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,610
Vimala, had it been anyone else...

520
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,720
would he have jumped in?

521
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,020
How could it have been anyone else?

522
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,560
You had to fall in, and
he had to rescue you.

523
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,920
It was preordained
by the Creator.

524
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,820
Creator?

525
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,150
- Is anyone there?
- Yes, of course. You.

526
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,890
- Is anyone there?
- Go, dear sir... Beauty beckons again.

527
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,120
You're truly shameless.

528
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,850
What have I said
that's so shameless?

529
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,540
Go forth, fortunate one...

530
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,870
You're getting another chance
to serve Beauty.

531
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:53,410
Dear Romeo...

532
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,810
why don't you go yourself?

533
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,600
Would any young man
reject such an opportunity?

534
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,100
I have my reasons.

535
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,510
- Go.
- Mister, please!

536
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,580
My dear boy, for once, listen!

537
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,760
- Go. Why don't you?
- You're very persistent.

538
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,560
Really?

539
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,850
Anyone there?

540
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,640
Thank you.

541
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,340
- Where do you want to go?
- Over there.

542
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,520
Come, let me escort you.

543
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,270
So, ultimately, the 'best' people
can't survive without us.

544
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,620
Meaning?

545
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,530
Pick this up.

546
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,900
Your wealth is definitely
your strength...

547
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,630
yet you don't have the strength
to lift your own burden.

548
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,560
Why are you acting like you're
doing me a favor? Here, take this.

549
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,350
- What's this?
- Your wages.

550
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,331
- I didn't carry your luggage for wages.
- Then, why did you carry it?

551
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,310
- Because I felt sorry for you.
- I don't need your sympathy.

552
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,820
Here!

553
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,140
A couple of cars and a few pieces of silver
have made you arrogant, memsaab.

554
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,830
- Apologize!
- No!

555
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,220
Apologize, or else...
Apologize!

556
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,960
You're very fortunate, my friend...
very fortunate.

557
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,420
One beautiful damsel
is being saved by you...

558
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,230
the other is slapping you.

559
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,540
You persuade me to help
and then, mock me?

560
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,710
I told you...

561
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,460
I have my constraints.

562
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,240
- I'm very sorry.
- Never mind.

563
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,010
In this world, every powerful person
oppresses the weak.

564
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,140
It's not that.

565
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,370
- What did you...?
- Hey, girl! Hey!

566
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,440
What did you think...?

567
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,870
What do you think? You could
beat the gentleman? Huh?

568
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,216
Hey, look over there!
The girls are wrestling!

569
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:40,240
[Muffled exclamations and exhortations.]

570
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,780
C'mon, trouser-clad lady, cmon!

571
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,926
- Bravo, lady, bravo! - Eh?
- The trouser-clad lady will win!

572
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:53,330
- The lady wearing the skirt!
- No, the trouser-clad lady will win. - Want to bet?

573
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:02,086
A-ha, look at the two of them fight...
Wow! Look at the pair!

574
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:09,100
[Muffled encouragement, exclamations.]

575
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,160
The trouser-clad lady...
Look, look!

576
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,510
Punch her! I've placed
a bet on you, punch!

577
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,220
Sorry, madam. What can you do?
Our local talent is better.

578
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,420
What did you think?
You could slap my babuji?

579
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,340
Give me my five rupees.
Give it here!

580
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,220
You're a child.

581
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,600
Naina... Naina...
Naina!

582
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,796
What does she think? She's wealthy?
I have seven twenties (Rs.140) too.

583
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,340
I have seven twenties. Really!

584
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,430
- You really have seven twenties?
- Yes.

585
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,430
How much do seven twenties make?

586
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,590
- This much!
- How innocent you are, Naina.

587
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,960
Alright, tell me...
you gave her a good beating?

588
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,016
- Yes, I did beat her up.
- But why?

589
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,660
Because she slapped babuji.

590
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,240
Er, Naina? Will you beat up
anyone who beats me?

591
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,690
- Yes, babuji.
- Why?

592
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,490
Er... because babuji saved me
from drowning.

593
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,440
But are you safe?

594
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,300
- What do you mean?
- It's your age.

595
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,290
At this age, people confuse death
with life, and vice versa.

596
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,880
- Hey, babuji... - Hmm?
- What does your friend mean?

597
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,450
Even your babuji cannot
understand what I say.

598
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,080
- Babuji? - Yes?
- She slapped you, didn't she? I really beat her up...

599
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,650
and I avenged you.

600
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,630
Naina? Why do you
take care of me like this?

601
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,620
Yes.

602
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,870
- She's truly divine.
- Yes, she's very innocent.

603
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:36,790
I've lost my heart to you,
I belong to you

604
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,980
If I want to...
how can I say so?

605
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,850
I've lost my heart to you

606
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,760
Stranger though you are to me,
I feel so close to you

607
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:08,770
Every expression of your love
seems like a dream

608
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,280
I've lost my heart to you
I belong to you

609
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,300
If I want to...
how can I say so?

610
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,370
Oh, I've lost my heart to you

611
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,310
My gaze fell as I looked [at you]
and as they fell, I gazed at you

612
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,250
And our eyes met

613
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,620
Flowers seemed to bloom
as our hearts became one

614
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,750
Like paths that meet
their destination

615
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,870
I've lost my heart to you
I belong to you

616
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,860
If I want to...
how can I say so?

617
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,080
Oh, I've lost my heart to you

618
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,706
I'm beginning to feel
embarrassed by myself

619
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:11,930
[As] I began singing
to myself in quiet solitude

620
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,100
I've lost my heart to you
I belong to you

621
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,270
If I want to...
how can I say so?

622
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:41,510
Oh, I've lost my heart to you...

623
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,370
That was beautiful.

624
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,920
- Babuji? - Hmm?
- Do you find me beautiful?

625
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,170
Yes, Naina.
Naina...

626
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,100
- you've worn a lot of jewelry today?
- Yes, babuji. - Why?

627
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,050
Because... yes, babuji...

628
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:06,430
- Er, does this jewelry belong to you?
- Yes, babuji.

629
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:09,060
- Hero!
- Huh?

630
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,910
Come on, hero.
I need to talk to you.

631
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,980
Come on!

632
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,360
How brazenly do these
city women approach the men!

633
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,990
- This is the culture today, Naina.
- Good God!

634
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,350
- Yes?
- Miss Sheela Singh...

635
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,450
Mr. Bhatia... Mrs. Donna...
Mrs. Bhatia...

636
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,100
Please sit down.
Where's my wife?

637
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,360
Yes, darling?

638
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,270
Hero!

639
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,290
The one who saved the girl?

640
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:48,180
- Come, come. - You're welcome.
- My husband.

641
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,150
- How do you do, sir?
- Hello!

642
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,080
- Let's have some beer.
- No, thank you.

643
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,180
Hero? Beer?

644
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,850
- No, thank you.
- Will you have champagne? - No, thank you.

645
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,630
- You haven't had champagne?
- No.

646
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,370
- Hero? Whisky?
- Excuse me, I don't drink.

647
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,670
- You don't drink?
- No.

648
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:13,960
- Won't you have something? You don't drink any alcohol?
- No.

649
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,840
My wife drinks like a fish.

650
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,530
[lncomprehensible.]

651
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,620
You truly are...

652
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,330
- an angel. Truly!
- You're God, Hero.

653
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,950
Hey, mister... get lost!

654
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:38,446
Mr. Kapoor, I didn't come here of
my own will. Your wife brought me here.

655
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:41,460
- But I'm telling you to go away.
- You don't own this place.

656
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:45,330
- Can't you see we first-class passengers are sitting here?
- Darling!

657
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,640
- First class passengers?
- No, darling! - Yes!

658
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,920
- I don't like it; I don't like him!
- Darling! - Go away!

659
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,610
- Go away!
- And if I don't?

660
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,600
Then I'll tell you how to leave.

661
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,280
- Do tell me. Quickly.
- Shall I do it? - Yes.

662
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,530
Bravo!

663
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,130
Darling!

664
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:03,980
Darling! Get up.

665
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,880
- Shut up!
- But... nothing happened.

666
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:11,100
Where's my revolver?
Where's it? I'll shoot him.

667
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,320
- Mr. Kapoor? - Yes?
- Here, take this.

668
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,660
- Huh?
- Shoot him.

669
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,350
- Come!
- Mother, what's up with you?

670
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:32,330
You're always causing trouble.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

671
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,696
Your mother and sister are accompanying
you, yet you're always getting into fights.

672
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,001
This is the third fight you've
got into since the morning.

673
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,806
But he hit me first, mother.

674
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,960
So what if he hit you? Who are you?
He's an important man.

675
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,630
So what if he's a rich man?
Are we indebted to him?

676
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,520
A-ha ha! Not a penny in
his pocket but such airs!

677
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,250
You couldn't stoop to request
them to give you a job.

678
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,240
- But you could get into fisticuffs.
- I can't humilate myself for a job, mother.

679
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,050
Really? Then what can you do?
You aren't even ashamed!

680
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,030
We sold everything to educate you
so you could find a job.

681
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,360
Not so you could wander unemployed
and get into fights.

682
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,070
- You know the reason.
- What's happened to you?

683
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,380
Stay there, father.
You're babuji...

684
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,660
- And I'm that man.
- What man?

685
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:13,130
That man.

686
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,540
And she...
she's my wife.

687
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,540
- What? Your wife?
- Yes. Yes, my wife.

688
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,710
- You are here... - Yes, yes.
- Now talk to her.

689
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:27,380
Hey! You're an
inconsequential person.

690
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,700
We're superior folk.
Why have you come here?

691
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,810
You will talk to my wife,
will you?

692
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,810
- I'll hit you.
- You will hit me?

693
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:40,080
- She hit me!
- Oh, God!

694
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,580
A curse on you!

695
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,490
You hit me quite hard.

696
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,950
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Yes...

697
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,660
It hurts a lot.

698
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,460
It hurts here, too.

699
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,180
I hurt here, too.

700
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,996
- Hey, old woman, give me the money.
- Give me water. - Pay me, first.

701
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,380
- Pay me the money. - Give me water.
- Okay, move on. Move.

702
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:05,440
- And what about you? - Give me water.
- First, pay the seth.

703
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,390
- I'll pay.
- Granny, you have to pay first.

704
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:11,690
- Look at that.
- Hey, come quickly.

705
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,160
- Buddhu!
- What is it, seth?

706
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,630
- Oh, okay.
- Hey, move it!

707
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,050
Bejewelled and made up...

708
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,060
she steps out...

709
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:32,340
Bejewelled and made up...

710
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:36,550
- she steps out...
- Miss... my throat is parched...

711
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,070
- please give me some water.
- Oh, my, I didn't bring this for you.

712
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,990
I brought it for my babuji.

713
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:48,810
Bejwelled and made up,
she stepped out...

714
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,780
- Are you blind?
- You're blind. Move aside!

715
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:58,990
- Hey, hey... babuji... please...
- Ram!

716
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,820
[Muffled exclamations and protests.]

717
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,240
- Ram! - Leave me, babuji. I'm suffocating.
- Babuji!

718
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,480
The seth sent me, babuji.
Please... let me go.

719
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:11,480
- Hey, babuji... babuji!
- Ram. Hey, Ram!

720
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,780
- Ram! - Let you go? I'll kill you!
- No, no!

721
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,170
- Babuji! - Ram! - Babuji...
- He's a bastard.

722
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,170
- Ram, let him go for my sake. Ram!
- Ram!

723
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,890
I beg you, Ram...
for my sake.

724
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,280
Calm down.

725
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:31,870
Naina...

726
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:39,570
I wasn't destined
to feed my babuji.

727
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,070
It doesn't matter, Naina.
Don't cry.

728
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,680
Come on, get up.

729
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,600
- Hey, give seth the money.
- Take it out.

730
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:59,800
- I'll give you water once you've paid.
- Welcome.

731
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,920
Sethji, I have to bathe
the idol of God.

732
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,210
So... if you could
spare some water?

733
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,060
Hey, you should install that
idol somewhere, Pandit.

734
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,710
I'll personally bathe the idol.

735
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,690
What a religious man!
How generous of him!

736
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:18,570
Yes, brother, if a blackmarketeer
isn't charitable, then who would be?

737
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,150
- Good-bye.
- Bravo, sir!

738
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,500
[Muffled cross-talk.]

739
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:27,640
He's a jolly good fellow,
he's a jolly good fellow...

740
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,820
He's a jolly good fellow!

741
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,200
- Gentlemen!
- What is it?

742
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,890
The idol has to be bathed.
If you could donate something...

743
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,980
- Here!
- What's this? Liquor? Oh, God!

744
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,470
- Praise be! - Lord, have mercy.
- Here, pandit...

745
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,180
My dear panditji, do you really
want to bathe this idol, or...

746
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,800
is it that you're thirsty,
and you need money?

747
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,780
Censuring God?
God save you.

748
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,040
Ram, what's wrong with you?

749
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,150
We sold everything
to educate you...

750
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,560
but you don't work. You keep getting
into fights, and now you mock God?

751
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,520
Stop taunting me at
every opportunity, mother...

752
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,320
by saying you educated me.
You didn't do me a favor.

753
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,180
You've just earned my enimity.

754
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,470
If I weren't educated...

755
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,920
I wouldn't have the ability to think; I'd
have been happy like this washerman.

756
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,240
Education has enabled
my judgment.

757
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,990
And... may I ask
where's your God?

758
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,300
When everyone is dying of thirst
but the seth is selling water...

759
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,410
Where was your God when goons
attacked innocent Naina?

760
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,760
And... where's your God...

761
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,060
when you sold everything
you owned to educate me?

762
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,940
And I'm still unemployed?
Of what use is 'God'?

763
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,886
I say there's no God!
No God.

764
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,210
There's no God?

765
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,436
- Don't be sad, mother.
- Look at him... won't work, and...

766
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,300
He won't work, mother, because
there's no job available.

767
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,850
You know you worry
that he hasn't found a job?

768
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:15,250
How will Vimala be married off?
These questions trouble him as well.

769
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,420
But... trust me, mother...

770
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,640
if he finds a grain
of hope somewhere...

771
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,840
then he will regain
his faith in God.

772
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,540
And you will always see him happy
and content, mother.

773
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,160
Offer him solace
and hope, mother.

774
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,680
Babuji...

775
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,760
Babuji?
Babuji...

776
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,450
The hero is coming.

777
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,620
Excuse me.

778
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,390
Babuji...
Babuji...

779
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,420
- Babuji, uh...
- WHAT?

780
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:02,990
What happened?

781
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,670
Nothing.

782
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,690
Go away!

783
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,050
You fight with your mother,
you abuse God...

784
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,420
- I won't go! So there!
- Uh oh...

785
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:36,420
Saving your life has
gotten me into trouble.

786
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,950
See, this was pre-ordained.

787
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,910
Was it also pre-ordained that you
would trouble me? Go away!

788
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,300
So what if your mother
slapped you?

789
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,650
Are you so grown up?
Come, make amends.

790
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,430
Look, mother is weeping.
Come, apologise... make amends.

791
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,710
Get up, won't you?
Come, apologise.

792
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,160
I salute Lord lshaana [Lord Shiva],
the highest form of Nirvaana

793
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,916
Present everywhere, his form embodying
the Brahman at the core of the Vedas

794
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,276
He's beyond the three gunas,
the vikalpas; he's free from all desires

795
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,150
The Lord who abides in
spiritual skies, I bow to him

796
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,750
Praise the Lord,
Glory to the Lord

797
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,250
Why, panditji! I see
you received alms. Bravo!

798
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,510
God is pleased with
sinners like him these days.

799
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,040
- Ram! - What's that?
- Sinner?

800
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,380
You are the sinner. Sethji is very
compassionate towards the Lord.

801
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,800
Bravo, panditji, bravo!
Here, take a few more coins.

802
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,000
- May you flourish.
- Hey, babuji...

803
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,970
these days, even God
can be appeased by flattery.

804
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:35,560
Which is why he sends
all the wealth Sethji's way.

805
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,550
You are right.

806
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,710
It's not the same God who once
listened to the common man's woes.

807
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:43,000
Even God has changed these days.

808
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:48,100
Look, O Man, at what's
happened to your God

809
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,810
How much has God changed...

810
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,700
Speak respectfully, you devil!

811
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,870
He visits not the houses of the poor
preferring to be a guest of the rich

812
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,770
- That's fine, my Lord...
- How much has God changed!

813
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:20,380
God is only pleased with
the devotion of men...

814
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,520
in whose houses
[the Goddess of] wealth resides

815
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:28,250
They, whose profession
is profiteering

816
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,740
They are the ones who please
the Lord of Brij [Lord Krishna]

817
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:34,550
He gives us hunger
and unemployment...

818
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:36,580
while he bestows
blessings on them

819
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:39,200
How much has God changed!

820
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,400
Look, O Man, at what's
happened to your God

821
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:50,090
How much has God changed!

822
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:57,640
Listening to this sinner's taunts...

823
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,210
please don't change
your residence

824
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:10,080
My Lord, my God, we have
a long, loving relationship

825
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,660
I am a satchel
you're a treasure trove

826
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:21,550
Please continue to fill
your devotee's lap with alms

827
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:24,300
Praise be to you, \nmy Lord God...

828
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,930
How much has God changed!

829
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,060
The rich are like mosquitoes

830
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,920
They build temples of gold

831
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,940
in which the Gods reside

832
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,670
'Perfect', says the
traveling entertainer

833
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,050
Get lost, monkey!

834
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:51,710
Wealth has become more powerful
than religion in this world

835
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:54,590
How much has God changed!

836
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:02,710
Look, O Man, at what's
happened to your God

837
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:05,480
How much has God changed!

838
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:13,610
He visits not the houses of the poor
preferring to be a guest of the rich

839
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,170
How much has God changed!

840
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,120
Praise the Lord!
Glory to God!

841
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,850
- Oh, God!
- Ram, go away from here!

842
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,690
- Folks, please leave.
- The old man has fainted. - Oh, God!

843
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,040
Dear God, please forgive my son!

844
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,870
- Forgive him, O God!
- Forgiveness? Never!

845
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,490
The wheels of God's justice
grind extremely slowly...

846
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,380
but they grind exceedingly fine.

847
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,870
The wheels of God's justice
grind extremely slowly...

848
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:49,446
but they grind exceedingly fine.

849
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:51,490
- No, no, panditji... show mercy.
- God!

850
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,240
It doesn't matter if the wheels
grind rough, just do it quickly!

851
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,750
Oh, sethji, he's young...
but a child...

852
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,750
- Alright. Bring the offering.
- Offering?

853
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:00,790
Forgive him, my Lord.

854
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,230
- Here.
- Put it there.

855
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,130
- Forgive him...
- Oh God...

856
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:08,630
please be merciful to my babuji.

857
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,230
- Listen... - Yes?
- They are troubling me...

858
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:24,100
- Who's troubling you?
- Some young layabouts.

859
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:27,350
Would you accompany me to the well?
I would like a drink.

860
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,240
- I'll pay you...
- No, my dear. What's this talk of money?

861
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:33,150
Come with me and wait here.
I'll ask for water.

862
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,380
- Thanks.
- Come.

863
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:50,730
- Where are you going?
- You see that girl sitting next to mother?

864
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,050
I've to bring her some water
and puris [fried bread].

865
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,690
Why should you?
She had slapped babuji.

866
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,070
But mother said so.

867
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:01,760
Come with me?

868
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,850
My dear, you're
honorable folk...

869
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,340
and your father must be
a very respected man.

870
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,030
I have a son... he's
educated but jobless.

871
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,150
Please get him a job
somewhere, my dear.

872
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:22,770
- I'll try.
- Oh, if you try, then I'm sure it'll be done.

873
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,410
Much obliged, my dear.

874
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:32,590
[Muffled conversation.]

875
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,580
- Give me a puri. - Give me puris.
- How many do you want?

876
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,830
- 16. - Give me Rs.4.
- Four rupees? Good lord!

877
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:52,056
Go away. You argue too much.
[Muffled demands for food.]

878
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,730
- You have to give me puris.
- What puris? - Be quick about it. Quick!

879
01:00:55,810 --> 01:01:03,810
[Muffled crosstalk continues
as food is being sold.]

880
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:16,420
[Demands for food
and water continue.]

881
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,920
- Give me water.
- Give me the money.

882
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,500
- People are beginning to fight.
- Here. - Ah.

883
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,430
- Fill it.
- Tell the seth.

884
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,430
No, no. I...

885
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,730
- am not hungry.
- Why, my dear? Eat a little.

886
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,900
- No, I'm not hungry.
- A little...

887
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,660
She must really not
be hungry, mother...

888
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,820
- or she would definitely have eaten.
- Oh, alright.

889
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,500
Material wealth will
be left behind...

890
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:46,550
[when you die] You cannot
take it with you

891
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:48,910
Babuji... babuji...

892
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:52,700
That girl? The one who
slapped you?

893
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,060
She's sitting beside mother.
And...

894
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:01,100
they bought puris for Rs.4
and water worth Re.1 for her.

895
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:03,580
Mother's calling you.

896
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,730
- I don't like her at all.
- I don't like her either.

897
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,540
- Really? - Really!
- That's alright, then.

898
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:15,591
- I'd like just the water...
- Give her the water, Vimala.

899
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,760
- Thank you.
- So, my dear...

900
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,210
don't forget the matter
of Ram's employment.

901
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,430
- I'll be much obliged. Ram, your job...
- Drop that glass!

902
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,220
You're rich, aren't you? Go, sit
beside the wealthy people!

903
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,890
Why have you come here? Go!

904
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:46,220
That you would demean yourself
so I would get a job, mother...

905
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:50,080
I cannot bear it.

906
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,660
I cannot bear it, mother.

907
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,270
I'd rather die hungry
than be disgraced.

908
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,060
Ram...

909
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,800
That's enough. You're right...

910
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,060
Why should I stoop before someone?
Am I less worthy? Huh?

911
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:13,540
Come, eat something.
My dear son, come, sit.

912
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,230
Er, um, Vimala...
where are the puris?

913
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,300
- Mr. Poet, please come.
- How can I eat with you, mother?

914
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:22,680
- I'll feed you.
- Yes, of course. Here.

915
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,160
Give her the puris.

916
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,610
First drink water...

917
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,650
Enough? Come on...
I'll feed you, okay?

918
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:58,090
The princess of Andher Nagri...
Miss lndira?

919
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,520
Thief! Thief!

920
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:24,810
- Catch him! Catch him!
- Thief! Thief!

921
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,860
Thief... thief... Catch him!

922
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:32,930
Ha! You will run, will you?
Why, the crook!

923
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:37,150
- What did you think? - It's alright
- Where're you going? - Come on. - Come.

924
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,800
Give him two slaps
on my behalf too.

925
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,860
Stop it! Why are you
beating me?

926
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:48,060
I picked one pocket, and you folks
began to beat me up.

927
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,790
This fat cat openly loots you, and
none of you raise any objections.

928
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:56,310
My dear sir, he
robs us legally...

929
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:58,750
while you break the law.

930
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:01,350
You'll be beaten up while
he gets away scot-free.

931
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,070
Bravo, Andher Nagri!

932
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:09,420
Andher Nagri...

933
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,890
And a confused ruler...

934
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:20,980
The city of darkness and a confused ruler

935
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:28,220
Where vegetables and
cashew nuts cost the same

936
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:31,790
Where cashew nuts cost the same

937
01:05:54,200 --> 01:06:00,500
The king rears some
elephants and horses

938
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:07,950
He has neither thought nor worry,
he lives in a palace after all

939
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:15,680
In his kingdom, under his rule,
we pay with our lives

940
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:23,010
As profiteers loot us openly
with both hands

941
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,840
Cashew nuts cost
the same as vegetables

942
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,510
Where cashew nuts
cost the same...

943
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:59,850
If you don't mind, dear sir,
kindly listen to my request

944
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:07,220
Where have you come from?
To which caste do you belong?

945
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:14,980
Don't ask him his lineage,
my friend, don't ask him his clan

946
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:22,120
Don't ask him how he
whiles away night and day

947
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:29,730
Whichever land or community
he belongs to...

948
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:37,250
Black or white,
their breed is the same

949
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:44,630
Different on the outside,
yet they are similar inside

950
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:51,700
Their clan is gold, their lineage silver,
and money their religion

951
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:55,470
Money is their religion

952
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,776
Be quiet!

953
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,830
Listen to me, my friends,
listen to me

954
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:12,930
May the profiteers be damned

955
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:19,800
Me, I'm but the world's steward,
I'm everyone's servitor

956
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:27,090
If you're thirsty, pay me,
get your water

957
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:34,430
If I didn't fry puris here,
you would all be eating grass

958
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:38,189
My wares are cheap,
my wares are fresh

959
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:43,030
Get lost and try your wiles
on someone else

960
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:46,710
We know, we recognize
each and every guile

961
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:54,070
You sell water to earn reward
for your virtues; bravo!

962
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,960
Get lost, go away…

963
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,450
The city of darkness
and a confused ruler

964
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:25,099
Listen to me, my friends,
stop this altercation

965
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:32,220
Everything is for sale in this world

966
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:39,720
The grocers sell flour, lentils and rice

967
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:47,180
While doctors and physicians
sell herbs and tinctures...

968
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:51,260
the powerful sell
their strength to the world...

969
01:09:51,649 --> 01:09:54,289
and the Sardars sell their heads

970
01:09:55,240 --> 01:10:01,770
The protectors of peace
sell dangerous weapons to tribes

971
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,170
So if I sell water,
why is there this brouhaha?

972
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,640
The city of darkness
and a confused ruler

973
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:24,030
Where vegetables and
cashew nuts cost the same

974
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:27,660
Where cashew nuts cost the same

975
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,160
Be careful!
Don't break official property,

976
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,060
- Where's the station master?
- Master? I'll get him.

977
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:30,690
It seems like you're
very angry with me.

978
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:36,220
Look, memsaab... you're
under a misapprehension.

979
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:41,550
I wasn't insulting His Majesty.
I was only painting an accurate picture.

980
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:44,340
You talk a lot, mister.

981
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:48,140
You're right. A poor man wags
his tongue; the rich use their fists.

982
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:52,680
- You remember, don't you?
- You haven't seen anything yet.

983
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,180
- You might see that in action.
- Meaning?

984
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:58,550
You will understand the meaning
only when you're handcuffed...

985
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,500
and put in jail.

986
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:02,340
Hey, brilliant, memsaab.
Thank you!

987
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:05,630
My mother is already upset with me
because I'm unemployed...

988
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:08,150
and I'm tired of
being jobless, too.

989
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:11,310
I'll at least get two square
meals a day in jail.

990
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,520
- You'll have to grind the flour.
- That's even better.

991
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:17,250
I'll get a job as well.
Memsaab...

992
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:20,270
if you could, please
do me this favor.

993
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:37,766
- Is this any place to put a chair?
- I put it there; how did it cget here?

994
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:40,346
- Take it away. - Yes, sir.
- It's this gentleman's fault.

995
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:43,236
- He takes His Majesty's portrait so he can insult him.
- What's this, mister?

996
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,190
- Where were you then?
- Ma'am.. me? I... I...I

997
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,770
- I...
- You make threats as if you are the princess.

998
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:54,580
- Sir, the signal...
- Eh? Oh, alright.

999
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:10,500
R - E - W - A - R - D

1000
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:18,130
Reward - 1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0.
A reward of Rs.10,000!

1001
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,720
- The princess is missing?
- How did you know?

1002
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,010
Memsaab? Memsaab, you had
asked for me, hadn't you?

1003
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:39,120
Hey! Why, young man,
what's the matter?

1004
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,700
Sir, if the princess is found,
we'll get Rs.10,000.

1005
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,740
You're crazy. Why would
the princess come to the jungle?

1006
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:50,600
If I find the princess,
then I'll get Rs.10,000.

1007
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:53,850
Show me where the princess is...

1008
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,240
and get me 10,000 rupees...

1009
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,780
- Give me Rs.10,000...
- it seems like he's gone mad.

1010
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:10,180
Gazing into each other's eyes...

1011
01:14:11,090 --> 01:14:14,100
- Mother, give me Rs.2.
- Eh? Why do you need it?

1012
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:15,826
I'll change that Rs.2 into
Rs.10,000, mother. Be quick.

1013
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,170
- Wow! - And how will you turn it into Rs.10,000?
- 10,000?

1014
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,330
Don't tell anyone.
Be quick, mother.

1015
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:24,040
But, son, I had only Rs.5,
and that's been spent.

1016
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,810
- Spent?
- Yes.

1017
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:29,010
Okay, mother. I'll make arrangements.

1018
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:37,040
Listen, says Kabir,
when you gaze at each other...

1019
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:42,820
What's the matter, poet?
What's published here?

1020
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:45,320
Nothing of importance, mother.
Remember that girl?

1021
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:49,000
- The girl you served puris? - Yes, yes.
- She's the princess of this state.

1022
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:51,840
- Wow! Princess! - Shh!
- Princess?

1023
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:56,460
Didn't you see, mother, how happy Ram
was at the thought of earning money?

1024
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,000
Dear God, if we get
this 10,000...

1025
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:02,670
all my troubles will end. Poet,
all my troubles will end.

1026
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:04,440
Dear God...

1027
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:09,376
- Hey, sethji, please listen...
[Muffled conversation]

1028
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:15,880
[Muffled conversations continue.]

1029
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,250
- Sethji, I need Rs.2.
- Why?

1030
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,720
Shall I leave?
I've had enough.

1031
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:28,210
Alright, sethji, 30 for you,
70 for me.

1032
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:30,830
40 for me, 60 for you.

1033
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,740
- Deal? - Yes, deal.
- Great!

1034
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,740
- Then give me Rs.2.
- Rs.2?

1035
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:40,220
- Where's the surety for my money?
- But, but... we are partners.

1036
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:43,220
So what if we're partners? What if
you run away with the money?

1037
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:50,240
Alright, alright. This is
my watch. Here, take this.

1038
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,010
- A-ha! That's more like it.
- Now give me Rs.2.

1039
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,490
Here you go; Re.1,
and 4 - 8 - 12, and 14.

1040
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:05,690
- One rupee and 14 annas.
- We'd struck a deal for Rs.2!

1041
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:08,330
Arre, the 2 annas goes towards
interest. Stop troubling me.

1042
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,960
Look here... what
are you dreaming of?

1043
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:23,580
Take a look at my artistry.

1044
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,710
I paid Rs.2 for something
worth Rs.100.

1045
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,310
Here, let me bind it
on your wrist.

1046
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,610
Eh? Oh, I got it
all wrong...

1047
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:38,440
this is a pocket watch.
Here, keep it safe.

1048
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,780
Excellent.

1049
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:46,160
Find me the princess...

1050
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:54,600
Ensure I get Rs.10,000...
find me the princess...

1051
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:48,960
If someone's belongings
have gone missing...

1052
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:53,450
If someone's belongings
have gone missing...

1053
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:57,480
tell me, and I'll return it.

1054
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:08,680
- If someone's belongings...
- Hey, mister!

1055
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,530
Get lost!
Why are you troubling us?

1056
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,790
I'm singing a song, memsaab.

1057
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:17,090
If you don't like it, then close
the window. I'll continue to sing.

1058
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,800
If someone's belongings
have gone missing...

1059
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:25,160
Memsaab, your spectacles. I found
your spectacles. Ohh... my arm!

1060
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:30,080
- Ooh, ooh... my arm!
- Does it hurt a lot? - It's broken!

1061
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,770
- I'm sorry!
- What happens to you, memsaab?

1062
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:36,970
- I'd come to return your spectacles.
- Please forgive me.

1063
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,950
Huh? Forgive you?

1064
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,240
You're forgiven.

1065
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:50,180
Er... please forgive me too.

1066
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:51,730
What're you saying?

1067
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,936
Oh, why are they delaying us?

1068
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:59,510
[People clamoring for
food and water.]

1069
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:03,570
[The clamor continues.]

1070
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:07,800
- Ah, where are the puris? - Hey, give 8 puris.
- 8 puris. Do you have money?

1071
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:12,780
- Demanding 8 puris! - Why don't you give me the puris?
- What's the problem?

1072
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:14,910
Doesn't have the money
and demands puris!

1073
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,020
You have my watch...

1074
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,960
- Yes, I do have your watch.
- So give me puris in exchange.

1075
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:23,200
- I'll charge you interest.
- Take it.

1076
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:25,900
- Four annas per rupee.
- Agreed.

1077
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,896
What're you doing?
Quickly pack 8 puris.

1078
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:34,290
[Passengers clamor
impatiently for food.]

1079
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:37,506
- Here, give me the puris.
- Your bill is Rs.4 and 8 annas.

1080
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:45,530
[The clamor intensifes as people
continue to demand food.]

1081
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:54,080
[Indistinct conversations continue.]

1082
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,310
Oh, my! Do the men in your city
eat food left over by women?

1083
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:18,346
[The clamor continues
in the background.]

1084
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:19,870
Shall I bring some more?

1085
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:24,430
- Will you also eat?
- No, thank you.

1086
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:32,440
I've never enjoyed the food at home
as much as I did this meal.

1087
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:35,000
Well, you're definitely hungry.

1088
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:38,560
Did you notice that the
enjoyment of food...

1089
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:40,900
has nothing to do with food.

1090
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:42,530
It depends on hunger.

1091
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:46,100
God has given the wealthy
plenty of food to eat...

1092
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:50,440
but he gave hunger to the poor
so they could enjoy their food.

1093
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,660
- God's ways are strange.
- Here, take this.

1094
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,060
Babuji...

1095
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,816
- Babuji? - Hmm?
- Have you settled your differences with that girl?

1096
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,890
- Yes, Naina.
- But, babuji, she slapped you.

1097
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,660
- It's okay, Naina. You don't understand.
- Babuji...

1098
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,121
- What's the matter? Tell me...
- Don't trouble me, Naina.

1099
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,660
- Now I'll drink some water.
- Come on.

1100
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:33,600
- Give the money to sethji. - Water.
- Give sethji the money.

1101
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:38,600
- Give me water. - Yes, sir.
- Hey, what are you doing?

1102
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,020
You're dirtying the glass.
Drink out of your cupped palms.

1103
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,520
- From my palms?
- Yes, of course. Like this...

1104
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:48,970
Not like that.
Look here... like this.

1105
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:51,110
Hey, move aside. Let me
get some water too.

1106
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:54,670
- Hey, drink quickly and move aside. There's a line of customers.
- Okay.

1107
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,690
- Er, ladle some water, please.
- Ladle it out quickly.

1108
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,870
- She's not drinking water. She's biting babuji's hands.
- Naina!

1109
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,590
What did I do that
babuji yelled at me?

1110
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:48,700
She wasn't drinking water.
She was biting babuji's hands.

1111
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:51,310
You're very innocent.

1112
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,730
Why has babuji changed so much?

1113
01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:56,960
- Money is very important, Naina.
- What?

1114
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,080
Your babuji wants money.

1115
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:05,100
- Will that girl give babuji money?
- Perhaps.

1116
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:12,860
Er... 715.

1117
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:17,000
15+10 = 25+10 = 35
+ 5 = 40+5 = 45+5 = 50.

1118
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,060
Seven hundred and fifty!

1119
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:21,570
Hey, you've landed a goldmine.

1120
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:25,240
Arre, excellent!
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5.

1121
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,740
These five coins as profit
and where's the watch?

1122
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:33,360
Aha! This watch is
worth Rs.100.

1123
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:37,770
A profit of Rs.105 during the day,
and the night is yet to come.

1124
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,610
Arre, truth to tell, you are Lakshmi,
the veritable Goddess of wealth.

1125
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,910
Bravo, you're blessed
with good fortune.

1126
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,060
I really did well
with my third wife.

1127
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,950
- Hide this watch. Hey!
- Hey!

1128
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:57,250
- This watch belongs to babuji.
- It's mine. I paid good money for it.

1129
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,080
'Belongs to babuji' indeed!

1130
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,410
Here, my dear. Keep it.

1131
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:10,880
- I can't walk any more.
- Shall I pick you up?

1132
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:13,970
- Can you pick me up?
- Of course! - Go ahead.

1133
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:37,520
Tired?

1134
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,120
- Ooh, re re re!
- Thank you!

1135
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,960
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

1136
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:22,760
- Why does this girl keep following you around?
- I'll be right back.

1137
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:35,760
What is it, Naina? Why are you
following me around?

1138
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:40,070
- Nothing at all. I...
- Tell me quickly. What is it you want to say?

1139
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,670
I've brought this...
this money.

1140
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:50,500
- There are seven twenties.
- Go away, Naina. I don't want it.

1141
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,740
You don't want it? But you've
given your watch to the seth.

1142
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:56,760
- That's different, Naina.
- What's different?

1143
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:59,880
The poet said that girl
gives you money.

1144
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:03,930
Please take it from me.
You didn't like that girl before.

1145
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:06,330
Don't trouble me, Naina.
Now go away.

1146
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:10,200
Babuji... do you
like that girl now?

1147
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,050
You're irritating me with your
innumerable questions, Naina.

1148
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:15,050
Go away from here.
Please go!

1149
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:43,820
- You look very happy, my friend.
- Hey, poet!

1150
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:47,190
Let me share some good news.
The princess...

1151
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:50,640
she... me... [whistles]

1152
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:53,020
I suspected that
a long time ago.

1153
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:55,460
- Really?
- Now may I share some good news?

1154
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:58,370
- Yes, of course.
- Naina is in love with you.

1155
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:01,570
Arre... are you comparing Naina
to the princess?

1156
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:06,520
Where am I drawing comparisons?
I'm only trying to say...

1157
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,620
that Naina is far better than
the princess in every way.

1158
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,520
For you, perhaps.

1159
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,090
- But for me, she's royalty, and Naina is redundant.
- Yes, she is.

1160
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:19,890
It's my good fortune, my friend,
that the princess loves me.

1161
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,990
Why do you consider this
good fortune?

1162
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:26,246
Arre... I'll get a job, my sister can be
married off, all our troubles will vanish.

1163
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:28,250
Are you falling in love
or making a deal?

1164
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:30,830
Where's the deal in this?
You can see...

1165
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,760
that money is life, money means respect,
it means everything.

1166
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:36,020
So you added two and two
to make four again.

1167
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,940
Ram... there's something lacking
in the princess's love...

1168
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,780
while Naina's love shines
with purity.

1169
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:46,250
- Sacrifice.
- If one had to sacrifice, my friend...

1170
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:48,580
then one may as well
scale the Himalayas.

1171
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:52,540
This world belongs to the rich.
One needs money here, my friend.

1172
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,930
So you love the princess
because she's wealthy.

1173
01:27:56,290 --> 01:27:59,280
And you reject Naina's love
because she's poor?

1174
01:27:59,770 --> 01:28:02,870
But remember, Ram, the poor
will triumph one day.

1175
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:08,290
That will be a great day, my friend,
and I'll be extremely happy.

1176
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,100
- You're very late.
- Yes.

1177
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:21,010
- Come... let's go away from here.
- Where?

1178
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,300
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Mmmm...

1179
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:29,390
- Babuji refused to take money from me.
- Yes, Naina.

1180
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,160
I'd taken seven twenties.

1181
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,440
Silly girl, how much do
seven twenties amount to?

1182
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,780
He needs thousands of twenties.

1183
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,180
How much does one thousand
twenties amount to?

1184
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:44,330
A lot... and that girl
can give him that.

1185
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:47,040
So... so babuji will
never be mine.

1186
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:49,200
- He... that girl...
- Yes, Naina.

1187
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:52,040
Even love can be
bartered these days.

1188
01:29:15,370 --> 01:29:23,370
Where two loving hearts are...

1189
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:32,070
weighed against gold and silver

1190
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:40,450
Tears are of no use there...

1191
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:47,970
nor are sighs...

1192
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:54,170
Through hamlets and settlements,
hills and vales, wanders a gypsy singing

1193
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,580
To the accompaniment
of his heart's music

1194
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:27,720
At long last, love has also become
a business in the bazaars of the world

1195
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:43,100
And there arose a wall of silver
between your heart and his

1196
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:52,840
Through hamlets and settlements,
hills and vales, wanders a gypsy singing

1197
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,950
To the accompaniment
of his heart's music

1198
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:23,720
Those like us are not destined
to know the blessings of affection

1199
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:40,740
The One who created us is
not God but stone

1200
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:53,920
Through hamlets and settlements,
hills and vales, wanders a gypsy singing

1201
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:57,230
To the accompaniment
of his heart's music

1202
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:25,100
Seeing this desolate edifice,
the poet's heart beats joyously

1203
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:34,100
- Bravo!
- The house of God is as empty and ruined as we are

1204
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:40,140
Bravo, Mr. Poet, bravo!
Bravo!

1205
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:43,050
- Bravo! - Bravo!
- The poet speaks but the truth. - Bravo!

1206
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:46,890
Look, O God, how these atheists
destroy your house.

1207
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:50,986
I speak the truth, Murari [Krishna], if
the train were to run within 24 hours...

1208
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:53,710
then I'll build you a grand temple here.
A grand temple.

1209
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:56,800
- What do you say, panditji? - Excellent.
- Panditji, pay attention...

1210
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:00,440
Oh, God... please listen
to the sethji's pleas.

1211
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:05,340
- Ensure a new dwelling for yourself.
- What are you saying, Mr. Poet?

1212
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:07,700
We are already
fighting for our lives...

1213
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:10,100
If the train is stationary
for another 24 hours...

1214
01:33:10,370 --> 01:33:12,460
you will only find
our corpses here.

1215
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,340
So what, my friend?
We manage to survive somehow...

1216
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,510
at least, God will
have a new dwelling!

1217
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:21,220
A-ha-ha! I've seen only one
sensible man on this train...

1218
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:23,430
God, we are all fools.

1219
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,750
Please listen to the sethji's promises
and get your dwelling built.

1220
01:33:27,570 --> 01:33:32,740
A-ha-ha... Everyone, say
'Glory to... Seth Naseeb Chand.'

1221
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:37,240
Come on... say 'Glory to
Seth Naseeb Chand!'

1222
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:45,900
Chant, chant the name
of Lord Ram

1223
01:33:52,880 --> 01:34:00,290
Chant the name of Lord Ram

1224
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:10,980
Please hold my hand, Lord Ram...

1225
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,500
Chant, chant the name
of Lord Ram...

1226
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:31,660
Ram... Ram... Ram... Ram...

1227
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:35,420
We are all your devotees

1228
01:34:35,850 --> 01:34:39,390
Your visage is beautiful

1229
01:34:39,770 --> 01:34:45,110
You have enshrined yourself
in my heart, O Ram

1230
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:57,040
I've escaped this world

1231
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,990
I've even lost myself

1232
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:06,480
When I enshrined you
in my heart, O Ram

1233
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:14,080
You've enshrined yourself
in my heart, O Ram

1234
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:18,220
Please hold my hand
in yours, O Ram

1235
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:29,750
Chant, chant the name
of Lord Ram...

1236
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:12,640
Chant, chant the name
of Lord Ram...

1237
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:17,020
Ram... Ram... Ram... Ram...

1238
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:20,940
I'm destroyed by love

1239
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,790
I'm a grieving woman

1240
01:36:25,230 --> 01:36:31,360
Please don't turn your face
away from me

1241
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:00,340
It's a beautiful evening
You can't be sorrowful

1242
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,290
Let's be merry and dance

1243
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,010
These edicts of love...

1244
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:33,660
These moonlit nights

1245
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:45,240
Lest they be lost somewhere,
go missing somewhere

1246
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:48,490
Do share the secrets
of your heart

1247
01:37:56,980 --> 01:38:00,776
Forget your sorrows,
lose yourself in her eyes

1248
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,340
Let's be merry and dance

1249
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:15,520
It's a beautiful evening.
You can't be sorrowful

1250
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,310
Let's be merry and dance

1251
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:33,450
Chant, chant the name
of Lord Ram

1252
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:37,360
It's a beautiful evening.
You can't be sorrowful

1253
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:39,920
Let's be merry and dance

1254
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:27,670
I don't like you dancing with others.

1255
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:41,410
Cruel one, you first punish me
and then mention my transgression?

1256
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:49,530
Anyway, it's all for the best.
At least, now I know you love me.

1257
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,500
Look here... see how hard
you slapped me?

1258
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:50,360
- It's past three.
- Why are you looking at the time?

1259
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:53,100
The night is passing.

1260
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:56,020
I didn't realize it.

1261
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,810
- Ram? - Hmm...?
- You won't desert me, will you?

1262
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:05,970
- Me?
- Yes.

1263
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:09,310
I'll never leave you.
But... you?

1264
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:13,060
I'll never leave you.
Never!

1265
01:41:14,090 --> 01:41:15,190
Promise?

1266
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:21,520
May I say something?
You won't be upset?

1267
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:23,170
Then don't say it.

1268
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,256
It has to be said.

1269
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,580
Really? Then say it quickly.

1270
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:34,250
I'm afraid... you may
misunderstand me.

1271
01:41:34,770 --> 01:41:36,170
Then say something else.

1272
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,020
I know you're the princess.

1273
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,196
I've sent a telegram
to His Majesty.

1274
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:45,530
- What did you do?
- Please don't misunderstand. I needed the money.

1275
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:49,440
- For money?
- We weren't involved with each other then.

1276
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:54,930
- He might arrive any time?
- Yes.

1277
01:41:57,580 --> 01:42:00,820
You shaped my dreams, and now you've
broken them. What do we do now?

1278
01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:03,470
How could I have known
I would be so fortunate...

1279
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,556
that a princess would
fall in love with me?

1280
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:07,080
Ram, let's run away!

1281
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:09,830
- Where?
- We can quickly cross the borders of this kingdom.

1282
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:12,830
- But my mother and sister?
- We can take them with us.

1283
01:42:13,650 --> 01:42:16,380
Where can we flee to?
I don't even have a job.

1284
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:19,780
I cannot get my sister married.
I have nothing.

1285
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:22,820
Except hunger, penury,
joblessness and failure.

1286
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:25,050
What right do I have to love?

1287
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:26,910
You love me...

1288
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,180
and perhaps even I can't
live without you.

1289
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:31,380
But where will this end?

1290
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:34,070
Separation? Failure?

1291
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:36,480
Nothing else.

1292
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:41,080
Please coax her. All her hopes
will be fulfilled.

1293
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:45,220
Your sister's wedding will take place.
You will get a job.

1294
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:47,330
- Isn't that okay?
- Yes. Come on.

1295
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,700
Naina...

1296
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:53,680
What're you doing?

1297
01:42:56,410 --> 01:42:59,410
A sorrowing person only
seeks solace in God.

1298
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:02,760
Poet...

1299
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:06,620
The Creator writes our destiny
at birth, doesn't he?

1300
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:08,380
Yes, Naina.

1301
01:43:09,070 --> 01:43:11,250
Then why is our life
so sorrowful?

1302
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:13,790
It's your fault, Naina.

1303
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:16,080
- My fault?
- Yes.

1304
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:20,140
You love someone and
wish it to requited, don't you?

1305
01:43:21,530 --> 01:43:24,530
- Then what do I do?
- Do your duty.

1306
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,540
Don't expect results.

1307
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:29,440
How is that possible?

1308
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,120
It's possible, Naina.

1309
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:36,500
Try to convince yourself.

1310
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,330
No... I can't do that.

1311
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:46,280
True love demands
sacrifice, Naina.

1312
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,230
No... no... no...

1313
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,270
You go. I'll make arrangements.

1314
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,940
- I'll go.
- Where to, Naina?

1315
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:16,230
He's coming. And that girl...
with babuji...

1316
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:19,220
- I can't bear it!
- Don't be weak, Naina.

1317
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:22,340
- I'll start crying, poet.
- Didn't you say...

1318
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:24,990
that the Creator writes
your destiny at birth?

1319
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:26,700
Try to understand it, Naina.

1320
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:29,230
- What do you want from me?
- Sacrifice, Naina.

1321
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,970
Or your love will weaken.

1322
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:35,580
Really? Please hide me if I cry.

1323
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:39,030
I don't want babuji
to see my tears.

1324
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:43,720
- Okay, my dear.
- Hey, it's 3 A.M. and you two are still awake?

1325
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:46,870
You're awake too.
The only difference is...

1326
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:49,840
some pass the night in joy, while
others grieve their way through it.

1327
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,850
Poet, you're always taunting me.

1328
01:44:52,630 --> 01:44:54,140
Do I taunt you, Ram?

1329
01:44:55,690 --> 01:44:58,300
Okay, poet. Please come here...
I want to discuss something.

1330
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:01,410
What's so important that you
have to conceal it from Naina?

1331
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:06,640
- Come on, tell.
- The fact is, poet, that...

1332
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:09,490
lndira and I have decided
to get married.

1333
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:11,010
- When?
- Immediately!

1334
01:45:13,270 --> 01:45:15,410
You're... you're getting married?

1335
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:19,340
This is good news.
This is very good news.

1336
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:24,350
- Isn't it, poet?
- Go on, Ram. Get your mother's permission at least.

1337
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:27,090
Go on, then. Get your
mother's permission.

1338
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:31,390
- Go.
- I'm very happy...

1339
01:45:32,490 --> 01:45:33,960
- very happy.
- Naina!

1340
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,700
Naina!

1341
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:46,320
- Mother! - Huh?
- Mother...

1342
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:49,660
- Why are you troubling me, Ram?
- Mother, I'm going to be a king.

1343
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,076
What? Are you insane?

1344
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:55,400
- What's the matter?
- You know the princess? She wants to marry me.

1345
01:45:55,490 --> 01:45:57,030
- Huh? - What?
- Really? - Yes.

1346
01:45:57,730 --> 01:46:00,290
- Ram? - Yes?
- Are you really going to be king?

1347
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:04,020
Yes, mother. And after that,
we will own bungalows and cars...

1348
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:07,030
No, no. I'm dreaming.

1349
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:09,460
- Dream? - Hmm...
- Just listen! - Mother!

1350
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,550
- Mother, get up! - It's not a dream, it's true.
- We will own cars...

1351
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,356
- bungalows...
- Yes, mother, so please give me permission.

1352
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:17,700
Yes, of course.
You have my permission.

1353
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:20,496
- So shall I make arrangements for the
wedding?- Yes, of course. Of course.

1354
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:23,680
- So get up. Do it quickly.
- What do I do?

1355
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:27,050
- Preparations for the wedding.
- Yes, son, that will be after we reach home?

1356
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:29,690
No, mother. The wedding will
take place right here, right now.

1357
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:33,050
- The wedding will take place here?
- Yes. - How's that possible, son?

1358
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,240
You haven't eloped
with the girl, have you?

1359
01:46:35,310 --> 01:46:37,576
You will be the bridegroom,
the wedding procession will proceed...

1360
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,720
the girl's father will give away the
bride... where will the procession go to?

1361
01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:44,840
The procession will come to my house.
My father will give away the bride.

1362
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,680
- The wedding will take place at my house.
- Naina!

1363
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:52,550
Poet... you said so yourself...
Sacrifice.

1364
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,920
At least the procession
will arrive at my doorstep...

1365
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,690
my father will
give away the bride

1366
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:02,980
- even if that's not me.
- Naina...

1367
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:08,430
Alright... Naina...

1368
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:10,680
Take Vimala with you
and get lndira ready.

1369
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,570
Go, Naina. Go on then.

1370
01:47:18,650 --> 01:47:20,420
Remember one thing, my friend...

1371
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:25,360
When you sit in a car,
and your vehicle sports a red light...

1372
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:28,090
and there's a police cordon
to ensure your security...

1373
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:32,290
don't ever forget that you are
one among us Trishankus.

1374
01:47:46,940 --> 01:47:48,040
You?

1375
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,380
Don't be worried.

1376
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:55,490
I haven't come to fight.

1377
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:59,090
I've come to get you ready
for the wedding.

1378
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:01,740
Come, Vimala.

1379
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:08,030
- Did mother agree?
- When did mother refuse?

1380
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:10,090
Come on, dear.
Get ready quickly.

1381
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:12,820
- Where should I come?
- To my hut.

1382
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,480
So the wedding will
take place at your home?

1383
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:19,310
I know my hut is not
worthy of you...

1384
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:21,610
- but even so...
- No, not at all, Naina.

1385
01:48:22,180 --> 01:48:24,600
It's not that at all.
But... the incovenience...

1386
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:26,200
lnconvenience? [Sighs]

1387
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:28,800
If babuji gets married
in my hut...

1388
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,670
it would be a blessing.

1389
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:33,750
How can it be a trouble?
Look, Vimala...

1390
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,030
- see what she's saying.
- Yes, absolutely...

1391
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:38,490
Naina is very happy about
my brother's wedding.

1392
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:42,570
How could I not be happy about
babuji's wedding, you silly girl?

1393
01:48:44,410 --> 01:48:45,930
Come on. Get ready quickly.

1394
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:50,230
- Which outfit will you wear for the wedding?
- You choose.

1395
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:52,740
You choose, Vimala.

1396
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:57,770
- This is beautiful.
- I prefer this one.

1397
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,470
Good. Why don't
both of you wear these?

1398
01:49:02,770 --> 01:49:05,870
- What?
- Yes, of course. Please wear them.

1399
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:10,250
- You wear it, Vimala, and...
- And you?

1400
01:49:11,620 --> 01:49:14,190
These clothes won't suit
the likes of us.

1401
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,660
Not at all, Naina.
You will look beautiful in them.

1402
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:18,500
- Please wear them.
- No.

1403
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:21,510
- Won't you listen to me?
- No...

1404
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:25,450
- Listen... please don't break my heart.
- Okay.

1405
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,690
Go on, then.
Change your clothes.

1406
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:57,440
- Here, poet.
- Mother, there's sand mixed in this.

1407
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:58,930
- Huh?
- Yes, mother.

1408
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,000
- There's sand.
- Spit it out.

1409
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:03,166
Don't eat this.
There's sand in it.

1410
01:50:03,190 --> 01:50:06,400
I picked one pocket and you
collectively beat me up.

1411
01:50:06,990 --> 01:50:10,500
That fat seth is feeding you sand,
and yet you all say nothing.

1412
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:14,470
- Friends, what do you say? Come on!
- Yes, come on!

1413
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:17,896
- Come on! - Quickly!
- Get ready, seth, to be beaten.

1414
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:23,236
[The mob begins to shout.]

1415
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:25,416
[Shouting continues.]

1416
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,240
- Nihal Chand?
- Yes, Naseeb Chand?

1417
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:30,440
- What's all the furore about?
- Oh, something or the other, no doubt.

1418
01:50:31,950 --> 01:50:34,180
- These people are looking for a fight.
- Really?

1419
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:35,940
Then you run away
from here. Run!

1420
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:38,930
You too... run! Run!

1421
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:43,626
- Hey, Nihal Chand!
- Yes, Naseeb Chandji...

1422
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:46,020
I can see the mob
coming this way.

1423
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:48,210
That's a problem.
Oh, God, run!

1424
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:52,370
- Where are the guys we hired?
- I'll just call them.

1425
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,370
- I'll call them.
- No, you stay.

1426
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:57,550
- Sethji, I'll just call them.
- Has your father gone to call them too?

1427
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,696
Hey, Nihal Chand, please stay!

1428
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:02,140
Oh, God, I'm in trouble.

1429
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:05,000
Thief! Thief! Thief!

1430
01:51:05,370 --> 01:51:07,490
Poet, Ram is sure to be
taking part in this fight.

1431
01:51:07,850 --> 01:51:11,490
No, mother. Ram has been ensnared
by the coils of wealth.

1432
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:13,570
He must be very content now.

1433
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:18,756
[Shouts come nearer.]

1434
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:22,676
[The melee continues.]

1435
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:25,000
What's the matter?
What's the...?

1436
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:29,200
You mix sand in our food, and
then ask, 'What's the matter?'

1437
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:32,300
- Hey, please listen to me...
- Alright. Tell us.

1438
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:34,600
- Please... listen to me...
- Go on, speak up.

1439
01:51:36,150 --> 01:51:39,990
- Man is made up of dust, is he not?
- Yes, he is.

1440
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:41,820
- Is he not? - Yes.
- Isn't he?

1441
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:46,710
Then if some dust goes into your
stomachs, what's the problem?

1442
01:51:47,070 --> 01:51:50,170
- Really?
- Then, friends, let's consign him to dust, too.

1443
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:58,300
[Exclamations and pleas
continue unabated.]

1444
01:51:59,110 --> 01:52:01,700
[Shouts continue.]

1445
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:07,420
They're beating him!

1446
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:10,080
Beating me?
I'm already dead.

1447
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:13,690
[Cries.]

1448
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:18,290
They're beating him...
they're beating him...

1449
01:52:18,330 --> 01:52:24,250
- [- Beat him! - Beat him!
- Move!]

1450
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:26,420
- Beat him!
- I'm dead...

1451
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:37,620
You beat me so pitilessly.

1452
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:40,540
Get lost, or you will
get some more!

1453
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:49,550
Why are you crying?

1454
01:52:50,210 --> 01:52:52,370
Did you think I was
getting beaten up?

1455
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:55,170
- Yes...
- Arre, you might think me an old man...

1456
01:52:55,740 --> 01:52:57,680
but it's my ill-fortune.

1457
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:00,300
Had you been there, you would
have seen my prowess.

1458
01:53:00,510 --> 01:53:02,500
I gave two of them...
owww...

1459
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:05,290
It's alright.
I got hit there.

1460
01:53:06,130 --> 01:53:08,190
Why is there so much blood?

1461
01:53:08,260 --> 01:53:10,280
As if that's my blood, my dear.

1462
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:12,280
Their blood is mixed with mine.

1463
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:20,870
Well, I did suffer one punch
to save my earnings.

1464
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:24,920
See here... I didn't give up
my earnings during the tussle.

1465
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:30,330
You're worried about the money;
I'm worried about you.

1466
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:32,400
Arre... what are you saying?

1467
01:53:33,230 --> 01:53:35,710
You may lose your life
but never your wealth.

1468
01:53:36,010 --> 01:53:38,760
See here... look...
how much I've earned.

1469
01:53:38,950 --> 01:53:42,460
I've to be treated with
turmeric and hot milk.

1470
01:53:42,570 --> 01:53:44,870
Go, bring me some
turmeric. Quickly.

1471
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:48,250
And some hot water.

1472
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:50,590
Make arrangements, please.

1473
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:53,960
We are alike.

1474
01:53:56,010 --> 01:53:57,840
- What's the difference?
- Destiny.

1475
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:01,100
One is wealthy,
the other is middle-class...

1476
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:03,560
and Naina is poor.

1477
01:54:04,530 --> 01:54:07,810
Really? These lines were
drawn by the Creator...

1478
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:12,690
Not the Creator, Naina. He made
the three of you alike.

1479
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:14,970
Man divided you
into rich and poor.

1480
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,120
Really?

1481
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,870
Anyway... let's go.

1482
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:49,550
My friend... your...

1483
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:57,450
palanquin will be lifted
by the bearers

1484
01:54:57,830 --> 01:55:04,420
My friend, the bearers will
soon lift your palanquin

1485
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:12,070
Your beloved is waiting
by the door

1486
01:55:17,590 --> 01:55:23,900
My friend, the bearers will
soon lift your palanquin

1487
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:51,290
Today, the bridegroom
of your dreams...

1488
01:55:51,350 --> 01:55:55,530
brings your wedding procession

1489
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:17,520
From the veil that masks
your shyness, remove...

1490
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:21,850
your hennaed hands

1491
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:29,680
Get dressed in all your splendor

1492
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:34,420
for your palanquin will
soon be lifted by bearers

1493
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:41,680
My friend, your palanquin will
soon be lifted by bearers

1494
01:57:02,270 --> 01:57:08,730
You are now united
to the one you belong

1495
01:57:08,790 --> 01:57:12,830
You have achieved your desires

1496
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:33,230
We are strangers

1497
01:57:33,260 --> 01:57:39,550
Who will remember us?

1498
01:57:42,220 --> 01:57:47,280
Give us a thought

1499
01:57:47,450 --> 01:57:52,470
for your palanquin will
soon be lifted by bearers

1500
01:57:52,910 --> 01:57:59,030
My friend, your palanquin will
soon be lifted by bearers

1501
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:07,160
Your beloved is waiting
by the door

1502
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:19,640
My friend, your palanquin will
soon be lifted by bearers

1503
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:30,260
- Okay, panditji, please begin.
- Yes, of course.

1504
01:58:30,990 --> 01:58:38,990
[Priest chanting wedding hymns.]

1505
01:58:49,070 --> 01:58:53,170
[The hymns continue...]

1506
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:15,250
His Majesty wishes to bless you
before he leaves. Please come.

1507
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:45,590
Please don't stop me.
Let me go.

1508
01:59:47,490 --> 01:59:49,930
His Gracious Majesty would
like to meet you first.

1509
01:59:57,010 --> 01:59:58,110
Come.

1510
02:00:17,190 --> 02:00:21,460
Oh, my daughter, I'm overjoyed
at meeting you again.

1511
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:27,190
The same joy that a hunter feels
in catching a bird that escaped?

1512
02:00:28,140 --> 02:00:30,660
Oh? So you're angry with me?

1513
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:33,560
I should be angry with you...

1514
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:37,190
that you cared not for our honor
and quietly left the palace.

1515
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:41,580
And now to save your honor...

1516
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:45,950
I've come away from my wedding
mandap with your soldiers.

1517
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,220
So you were getting married?

1518
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:50,780
Or...

1519
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:56,740
Or I would have been deprived
of the greatest joy of my life.

1520
02:00:57,740 --> 02:01:00,580
I wouldn't have been able to be a part
of my only daughter's wedding.

1521
02:01:01,700 --> 02:01:04,430
Then, please come and
give us your blessings.

1522
02:01:04,530 --> 02:01:06,980
But my dear, at least tell us...

1523
02:01:07,410 --> 02:01:10,760
upon whom am I bestowing
my most beloved daughter?

1524
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:14,980
- What do you want to know?
- What's his name?

1525
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:18,300
- Ram. - Ram?
- Yes.

1526
02:01:18,690 --> 02:01:22,240
The telegram that was sent to us?
I think it was the same name.

1527
02:01:22,610 --> 02:01:26,590
- Yes.
- Hmm... so you know that he sent the cable?

1528
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:28,390
- Yes.
- Why did he send it?

1529
02:01:29,780 --> 02:01:31,280
- We weren't in love.
- Understood.

1530
02:01:32,540 --> 02:01:36,890
So he fell in love with you when
he learned you were a princess?

1531
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:38,950
- What are you trying to say?
- That...

1532
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:41,830
does he love you
or the princess?

1533
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:44,880
I understand your meaning very well.

1534
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:48,580
You think he loves
my wealth, not me.

1535
02:01:49,480 --> 02:01:51,420
You're insulting
your own daughter.

1536
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:54,200
I'm not insulting you,
my dear. I think...

1537
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:56,690
youth is often overcome
by emotion...

1538
02:01:57,150 --> 02:01:58,860
while old age proceeds with caution.

1539
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:02,950
- If you agree, may I call him in and ask?
- Without a doubt.

1540
02:02:03,430 --> 02:02:07,190
But listen... if you try to
coerce him by threatening him...

1541
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:09,540
you'll only find my corpse.

1542
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:11,300
Why would I make threats?

1543
02:02:12,150 --> 02:02:13,650
If you don't believe me...

1544
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:17,500
you may stand outside
the window and listen.

1545
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:21,280
- You can see your Ram's true self.
- Your suspicions will be proved wrong.

1546
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:23,370
And I'll truly be happy.

1547
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:28,520
Ram!

1548
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:39,750
Come in.

1549
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:56,410
Come, sit. Please... sit down.

1550
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:07,230
Your name is Ram, isn't it?

1551
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:08,830
Yes.

1552
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:14,080
You did us a great kindness
in sending us the cable.

1553
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:19,670
- Not at all.
- We got the princess back due to your help.

1554
02:03:21,050 --> 02:03:25,140
- Here's your reward.
- Please don't embarrass me.

1555
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:27,900
I don't understand the reason
for this refusal.

1556
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:31,810
Sir, now I need your blessings.

1557
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:34,330
I need a father's benevolence.

1558
02:03:34,990 --> 02:03:37,320
Oh. I made a huge mistake.

1559
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:40,740
You must have grabbed
many rich rewards before this.

1560
02:03:41,260 --> 02:03:43,660
What's a mere Rs.10,000!

1561
02:03:44,290 --> 02:03:46,030
Excuse me...
what do you mean?

1562
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:53,420
Only that the richest reward
in the world is love.

1563
02:03:55,010 --> 02:03:58,330
Anyway, Ram, tell me...
what do you do?

1564
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:01,410
Nothing, as of now...

1565
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:03,710
but I hope to get a job soon.

1566
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:06,690
And if you do get one,
how much will you...

1567
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:09,670
I mean... do you have any idea
about the salary?

1568
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:12,820
Around 50-70 rupees monthly.

1569
02:04:12,990 --> 02:04:17,010
Hmm... but it will be difficult
to subsist on this.

1570
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:19,720
And then... you're getting
married to a princess.

1571
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:23,930
She spends this amount
daily on flowers.

1572
02:04:24,250 --> 02:04:25,660
Don't be offended, Ram...

1573
02:04:26,110 --> 02:04:28,560
I'm saying this
for your own good.

1574
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:33,370
Alright, Ram...
if, after marriage...

1575
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:35,840
I give you a decent allowance...

1576
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:40,020
and arrange for a bungalow,
a car, etc...

1577
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:43,860
you wouldn't mind, would you?

1578
02:04:44,530 --> 02:04:46,720
- Excuse me?
- You would mind?

1579
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:49,400
Well... why would I mind?

1580
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:52,280
I've to look after the princess's
comfort, after all.

1581
02:04:52,830 --> 02:04:56,320
Actually, we have to look after
your comfort too.

1582
02:04:58,070 --> 02:04:59,930
- Am I not right?
- Yes.

1583
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:06,650
Let me ask you, there's no doubt
you love the princess very much.

1584
02:05:07,550 --> 02:05:10,220
- More than anything in the world, perhaps.
- Without a doubt!

1585
02:05:10,610 --> 02:05:14,200
- But not when you sent us the cable?
- No.

1586
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:19,820
You are a decent young man,
from a respectable family.

1587
02:05:20,660 --> 02:05:23,030
Just once... for humanity's
sake, tell me...

1588
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:27,210
when you enshrined the princess
in your heart...

1589
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:30,100
was she a mere woman?
Or a princess?

1590
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:33,590
- Er...
- I want to ask just this one question...

1591
02:05:34,070 --> 02:05:36,580
when you looked at her
with love in your eyes...

1592
02:05:37,070 --> 02:05:38,790
did you only see her face?

1593
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:42,890
Or did you see the
name, wealth, fame...

1594
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:45,330
and all the comforts of the world
connected to her birth?

1595
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:48,080
Don't deceive yourself, Ram.

1596
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,410
Don't deceive the princess
who lives only for your love.

1597
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:54,446
Tell me truthfully.
Before you fell in love...

1598
02:05:54,470 --> 02:05:56,450
didn't you consider the
princess's wealth at all?

1599
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:03,020
- Why don't you answer?
- I'd thought of it.

1600
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:27,130
Thank you. You've awakened
my conscience.

1601
02:06:35,650 --> 02:06:38,380
Here. Take this.
It's what you love.

1602
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:41,430
Yes. I love money.

1603
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:44,270
But tell me, don't you
love money as well?

1604
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:47,470
You want wealth
to remain with you...

1605
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:50,560
so you can be considered
worthy and honorable.

1606
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:54,890
And I'll always be called
unworthy, helpless and poor.

1607
02:06:55,120 --> 02:06:57,880
Why, I ask you? In what way
am I less worthy than you?

1608
02:06:58,230 --> 02:07:01,460
I'm a human being like you;
I'm as educated as you are.

1609
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:05,540
You need wealth for your luxuries, for
your comfort, to throw away...

1610
02:07:06,030 --> 02:07:08,040
but I need it for
two square meals.

1611
02:07:08,550 --> 02:07:11,880
Is that a crime? I would definitely
have taken this money...

1612
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,070
but it smells of privilege
and hatred.

1613
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:17,520
- Such filthy...
- Oh!

1614
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:12,110
Chant, chant the name of Ram...

1615
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:20,670
Please take my hand, Lord Ram...

1616
02:08:21,580 --> 02:08:24,810
- Ram...
- Goddess!

1617
02:08:28,410 --> 02:08:31,870
You even forgot my name, babuji?
I'm Naina.

1618
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:35,640
I couldn't recognize
your love for me.

1619
02:08:36,610 --> 02:08:39,900
I live in a house, yet I began
to dream of palaces.

1620
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:43,650
That was my mistake.
Now I've come to you.

1621
02:08:44,570 --> 02:08:46,570
If you couldn't reach the palace
from your house...

1622
02:08:47,210 --> 02:08:49,010
then don't come to
the hut either, babu.

1623
02:08:51,380 --> 02:08:55,170
- Won't you accept me either, Naina?
- Don't say that, babuji.

1624
02:08:56,090 --> 02:08:59,710
- I'm not worthy of you, - Where will
he find someone worthier than you?

1625
02:09:00,070 --> 02:09:03,260
Look, Ram... the poor
triumphed, didn't they?

1626
02:09:04,060 --> 02:09:07,020
Anyway, when the poor and
the middle-class have united...

1627
02:09:07,290 --> 02:09:08,790
the rich will also come.

1628
02:09:09,470 --> 02:09:12,170
Naina, you're getting
the fruits of your sacrifice.

1629
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:19,020
Come along; it's time
for the train to leave.

1630
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:22,940
- Let your wedding take place here.
- But... my father?

1631
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:25,976
- I'll get him to agree.
- And I... my mother...

1632
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,140
I'll bring her with me too.
Come on, get up.

1633
02:09:32,330 --> 02:09:34,700
- Babu saheb...
- Eh?

1634
02:09:35,710 --> 02:09:37,620
You called me a thief.

1635
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:40,570
But you turned out to be
a bigger thief, eh?

1636
02:09:40,830 --> 02:09:44,590
You're taking away that
poor old man's life savings.

1637
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:46,590
It's alright.

1638
02:09:47,370 --> 02:09:49,680
Naina, will you listen to me?

1639
02:09:50,930 --> 02:09:52,440
You won't refuse, will you?

1640
02:09:52,740 --> 02:09:54,180
Don't refuse, Naina.

1641
02:09:54,690 --> 02:09:57,640
I see tears of repentance
in sethji's eyes.

1642
02:09:58,570 --> 02:10:00,680
Here, these are my
total earnings from here.

1643
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:03,180
Sethji, are you really taking out
the total amount?

1644
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:05,480
I'm making amends for my lapse.

1645
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:09,160
Listen, friends, this money
belongs to you.

1646
02:10:09,770 --> 02:10:13,100
And I'm giving it, on your behalf, to
this young girl as a wedding present.

1647
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:15,250
- No, sethji.
- You keep quiet.

1648
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:16,860
You're a greedy man.

1649
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:20,150
You left this Goddess to
run behind a wealthy woman.

1650
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:24,110
Sethji, but why did you
conduct this business?

1651
02:10:24,420 --> 02:10:26,590
Ah, greed raised its ugly head.

1652
02:10:26,890 --> 02:10:29,580
Greed is an ugly thing.
Look at this old man...

1653
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:32,740
he sold his shop and well
out of greed.

1654
02:10:32,890 --> 02:10:35,440
And him? You know
very well how he is.

1655
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:38,320
And these wealthy folk..
The wealthy folk...

1656
02:10:38,620 --> 02:10:42,010
- they want to sit in First Class.
- Shut up!

1657
02:10:42,810 --> 02:10:44,320
- Shut up!
- Who said 'shut up'?

1658
02:10:51,150 --> 02:10:54,400
Sethji, if everyone in the country
rejected greed...

1659
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,636
- how wonderful would it be.
- Yes, absolutely!

1660
02:10:56,660 --> 02:10:58,950
Board quickly, the train
will leave soon.

1661
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:12,940
Fools they are that worry about
wealth and riches

1662
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:18,960
For heaven lies in that abode
where two loving hearts reside

1663
02:11:19,060 --> 02:11:25,390
Through hamlets and settlements,
hills and vales wanders a gypsy singing

1664
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:28,440
To the accompaniment
of his heart's music
