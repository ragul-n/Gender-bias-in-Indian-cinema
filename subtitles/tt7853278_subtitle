I must suffer more than this

51
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:15,875
It's because of you,

52
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,083
I decided to die.

53
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,667
You were about to die
because of me?

54
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,292
Are you drunk?

I'm in inebriated condition.
Everything went off now.

56
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:29,833
Don't be in hurry.
Tell me,

00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:30,458
Who are you?

58
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,625
Why do you act?

59
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:32,625
Aren't you Pandi?

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,167
I'm not Pandi or Aandi.

61
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:35,292
I'm Dhoni...

62
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,667
"Dhoni Kumar,"

63
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:37,833
Who are you?

64
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,417
If you change your name,

65
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:40,750
Are you not him?

66
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:41,708
If you are not Pandi,

67
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:44,458
Then show me the scar
in your hand.

68
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:44,750
Hey....

69
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,125
What scar are you talking about?

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,625
Are you mad?

71
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,833
Aren't you my Pandi,then?

72
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,042
I told you,
I'm not Pandi.

73
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,542
Who are you?

74
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:00,167
My name is "Nadhiya."

75
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,792
In my village carnival,

76
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:04,167
A person who resembles you,

77
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,292
came to sell dolls.

78
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,875
I like him very much.

79
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,542
I was expecting the carnival ever.

80
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,542
I spent much time looking
at him than the carnival.

81
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:13,875
His name is "Pandi,"

82
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,458
Lift the banner.

83
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:34,792
Lift the banner.

84
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:41,250
A song from the movie "VETTAIKARAN,".

85
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,958
An announcement to the people.

86
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,458
As auspicious time has started,

87
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:50,458
Those who are offering
to goddess can come forward.

88
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,417
We repeat it.

89
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,583
An announcement to the people.

00:06:55,458 --> 00:07:00,167
Those who are offering
to goddess can come forward.

91
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:15,667

Get up.

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,750
Is it right to sleep in the shop?

96
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,167
Will i sleep in toilet
rather than shop?

97
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,625
Look at the business
in the morning.

98
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,083
Shall we sell alcohol
in the evening?

99
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:30,458
No...

I want a tiger toy.

102
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,958
Ask me that.

00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:37,125
Where is it?

104
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:37,875

Not this.

118
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,000
It's a deer!

119
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,000
What?
Is it a deer?

120
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,375
It is a horse.

121
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,625

132
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,292
Can't you identify it in front?

133
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,417

How much is this ship?

141
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,375
Is that a ship?

142
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,750
Let it be a car.

143
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:24,292
A car!

144
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:24,833
How much?

145
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:25,458
Dai,

146
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:26,458
Keep it there.

147
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,458
You are losing a customer.

148
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:28,833
First,keep it there.

149
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:29,792
Are you a customer?

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,750
Thief!

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,958
You can't even spend to
buy a toy.

152
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,958
You are telling horse instead of elephant.

153
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,250
I'll tear you.

154
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,417
I can't do a business.

155
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,333
Why do you brawl
in the morning?

156
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:41,917
What do you want?

157
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:42,958
A helicopter!

158
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:43,958
A train?

159
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:45,292
It's there,take it.

160
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:46,667
Not train,

161
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,750
It's helicopter!

162
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:49,958
Yes,take that.

163
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,042
How much?

164
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,667
Rs.2000,
-You mean Rs.2000!

165
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes,it's a special variant.

166
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,042
If you press the green button,
It'll go up.

167
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,125
If you press the red button,
It'll go down.

168
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,125
If both are pressed?

169
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,042
Then it's waste of your money!

170
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,625
Okay,show me the sample.

171
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:02,333
You mean the sample?

172
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,917
Take it at nearby graveyard.

173
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,458
Show me the demo.

174
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:05,667
Oh,

175
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:06,875
It's demo!

176
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,458
Open the box,

177
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:09,875
Keep the toy in plain surface.

178
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:10,583
See here,

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,792
In left is the red button,

180
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:12,750
In right is the green button.

181
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:14,917
It'll go up if you press the green one.
It's going up!

182
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:16,875
Pressed the green button now.

183
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,417
It's flying high.

184
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,417
If you switch the right gear,

185
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,417
it'll go right.

186
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:22,792
If you switch the left gear,

187
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,167
it'll go left.

188
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,667
I didn't expect that
you'll love me!

189
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,292
What's that you like in me?

190
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,292
It's your hair style!

191
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,958
I never seen such a
curly hair.

192
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,417
It was born with me.
No one can change it.

193
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,542
You cheat!

194
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,042
You said it was born
with you?

195
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:41,917
Are you bald head?

196
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:42,583
What's that?

197
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,500
He came like MS Dhoni,

198
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,292
Now become like
MS Bhaskar!

199
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,833
Get lost.
You and your love.

200
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:48,958
You are a cheat!

201
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:49,750
Goof!

202
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:50,083
Nayan...

203
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:50,667
Nayan...

204
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,667
Please my dear...

205
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:52,500
Take it.

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,667
You showed up.

207
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:54,500
Now show me down.

208
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,292
I'm not the person
who you think about.

209
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,083
The demo of flying up
is okay,

210
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,208
Now show the demo
going down.

211
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,167
Tell me clearly.

212
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,667
Hold it.

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,667
I'll get another one.

214
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:02,750
You are doing too much.

215
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,917
You too.

216
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,125
It's an imported one.

217
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:07,500
Let it stand on the
plain surface.

218
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,667
Now it goes straight
in low angle.

219
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,667
Is it going?

220
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,875
Is it going down?

221
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,917
Signal is not clear.

222
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,042
No...no...

223
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,875
It hits some rock!

224
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,208
Bursted!

225
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,208
Everything has been a waste
in business with you.

226
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,250
Hold it.
Hold it.

227
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:31,125
You manage her.

228
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,042
I'll hide.

229
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,042
She comes ferociously.

230
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:35,125
Don't move.

231
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,500
Is it the place to hit and hide?

232
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,083
Come and look at the toys.

233
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,583
Here is a dog!

234
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:43,667
Superb...
Superb dog.

235
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,083
Superb...
Superb dog.

236
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,375
She stares at me!

237
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,500
Look at this bear.
It looks beautiful like you.

238
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,792
Is it the place to hit?

239
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,333
Then,is that a place to read?

240
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,958
Why did you hit?

241
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:56,917
Let it be,

242
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,583
Respond me for the bursting.

243
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:00,000
You respond me for hitting.

244
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:00,667
Hey,

245
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:03,208
Who told you to go in runway
when a helicopter is coming?

246
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,125
You respond me for hitting.

247
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,458
When you feel for hitting,

248
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,042
How much I must feel for
the bursting of my helicopter?

249
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:09,250
Hey,

250
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:10,458
You reply to me.

251
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,417
Just wait,i'll clear it first.

252
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:13,792
You respond me for hitting.

253
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,500
You give me the money.

254
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,292
You take another one.
-Hey,

255
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,292
Then show me a sample.

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,292
Hey,

257
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,042
See here,

258
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,625
I'll burn you into ashes.

259
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,292
Don't talk.
i'll slay you.

260
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,208
First,you respond for hitting me.

261
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:25,083
Oh my god!

262
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,167
It's my mistake.

263
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,083
Will you please go?

264
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,667
You'll be blessed.

265
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,167
I pardon you.

266
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:30,667
Okay,

267
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,042
Be careful.
Go...

268
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:33,917
Go...go...

269
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:35,083
Show me the sample.

270
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:35,667
Come on.

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,083
You are killing me.
-Show it.

272
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,625
It's the last one.

273
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,292
Who asked you to buy it?

274
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:43,667
Show it first.

275
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:46,292
Don't ask for sample again.

276
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,625
Wish it must sell.

277
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,875
I lost all the money
borrowed for interest.

278
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,375
This is the last one.

279
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,583
Go away with it.

280
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,250
Let it function properly.

281
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,500
I'll operate it right.
You look at it.

282
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,333
Why it's not moving?

283
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,458
That's it...

284
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,542
Come on...
Come on...

285
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,333
The limit for the trial is over.

286
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:20,667
Shall we turn it?

287
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:26,792
Put the break.

288
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,625
Put the break.

289
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,667
I'm going to hit your head.

290
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,375
It's switched off.

291
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,125
You buffalo!

292
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you doing?

293
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,417
Killed me to show sample.

294
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,667
"Pandi..."

295
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,792
"Pandi..."

296
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:44,917
Who is that Pandi?
-"Pandi..."

297
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,000
How dare to ask?

298
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,458
"Bill hook lute,"

299
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,125
"Veerapandi troop,"

300
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,625
"Grand son of veera shivaji..."

301
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,333
Now he"ll come flying...

302
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,125
Dude,

303
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,583
You saved a beautiful girl.

304
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:12,750
Not the girl?

305
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,125
It's an imported one.

306
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,917
A huge loss,if damaged.

307
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:18,792
Afore,one was bursted
on hitting twin towers.

308
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:19,417
What?

309
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,250
Twin towers in America!

310
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:22,875
Hey,

311
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,958
Who is there in the shop?
-Yes,i'm there in shop.

312
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:25,333
You...

313
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:25,958
Dude!

314
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,042
Come on ladies and gentlemen!

315
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,083
Sisters!

316
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,667
Brothers!

317
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,292
Young lads!

318
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,208
Elders!

319
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:53,458
Come on ladies and gentlemen!

320
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,667
Look at the deer toy.

321
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,958
Do you know how
the deer dances?

322
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:56,875
It'll dance like this!

323
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:58,625
Hey,

324
00:13:59,292 --> 00:13:59,750
Will the deer dance like this?

325
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,417
No...

326
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,958
Come on ladies and gentlemen!

327
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,542
It's the elephant toy.

328
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:07,958
Do you know
how the elephant grunts?

329
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:08,750
Hey,

330
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:09,542
I'll manage it.

331
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,292
Come on ladies and gentlemen!

332
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:24,792
Come on ladies and gentlemen!
-Look at the tiger toy.

333
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,375
Do you know how it sounds?

334
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:27,667
Hey,

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,625
Do it right.

336
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,167
Why the tiger sounds
like a cat?

337
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,667
Tiger has got throat infection.

338
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:33,667
Do you have money?

339
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:34,667
No.
-Then go away.

340
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,292
Is the monkey not well?
-Why?

341
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,875
It's not mischievous.

342
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,625
Will the monkey be mischievous?

343
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:46,542
Have you seen gorilla's acts?

344
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:47,458
Come here.

345
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,792
I'm selling toys for my life,
-Leave him.

346
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,667
How dare you talk playfully.

347
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:58,625
What happened?

348
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,750
He asked whether the monkey
won't play?

349
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:01,083
Hmm,

350
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,208
That's what I showed him.

351
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,375
If you carry on it,
Our business will be good.

352
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,792
How to do business with stingy persons?

353
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,750
Come on ladies and gentlemen!

354
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,125
This is the toy which talks!

355
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,125
What do you say?

356
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:13,167
Does it talk?

357
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:13,667
Yes,

358
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,250
It knows all languages.

359
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,250
Hindi,English,Malayalam,Tamil...

360
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,292
... Coimbatore,Madurai.

361
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:20,792
Stop it.

362
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,667
How much?
Rs.2000,

363
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:24,167
Hmm,

364
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,500
It's not balanced by the company.

365
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,500
It's Rs.2000,

366
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:28,875
Whether you buy it or not.

367
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:29,667
I too said the same!

368
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:30,500
What's special in it?

369
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,125
We added ghee and cashews.

370
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,250
Look at him.

371
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:35,208
See her mouth.

372
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:35,917
It's so special!

373
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,500
It'll revert to whatever you ask.
-Yes.

374
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,375
Shall I see a demo?

375
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:39,667
Hmm,

376
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,208
Yes..

377
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,542
Yes,sure.

378
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:43,208
Now see

379
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,125
It'll reply

380
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,250
What is your name?

381
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,375
My name is Vodka.

382
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,583
What do you eat?

383
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:49,375
Hmm,

384
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:50,083
Pickle!

385
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:51,958
It talks in rhyming.
-Yes,

386
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,958
not only rhyming words,
It'll say rhymes too.

387
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:54,750
Hmm.
-Yes.

388
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:56,458
You can try.

389
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,583
You talk well.

390
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,667
Will you come to my house?

391
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,583
I'll come where ever,
If you give the money.

392
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,125
Aah!

393
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,750
It resembles her!
-Hey...

394
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,542
I said it talks so cute.

395
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,583
If you kiss,

396
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,917
It'll also repeat.
-Yes,like me.

397
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,542
Pack and give it.

398
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,167
Yes.

399
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,125
Pack it.

400
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:18,958
Get it.

401
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:19,417
Give me.
-Take it.

402
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:20,292
Okay.

403
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,958
They are abducting me.

404
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:23,208
Hey,

405
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,833
Don't talk.
They'll look after you well.

406
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,625
Take care of it.

407
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:27,667
Be good,okay?

408
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:28,625
You may leave.
-Okay.

409
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,417
Go...go...

410
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,208
Buy dress when you go.
-Hey.

411
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:32,125
Not to you,
it's for the toy.

412
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:33,750
Come on... come on...

413
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,458
Where are they?
There!

414
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:36,667
You must give the money.

415
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:37,667
Hey,

416
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,292
I'm searching for you.

417
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,042
We are here only.

418
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:41,917
What's that doll?

419
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,333
It's the Japanese doll.

420
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,333
It'll revert us.

421
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:46,208
Is it?

422
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,625
Let it talk now.

423
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,542
Just a minute.

424
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,833
What is your name?
-My name is La Martin.

425
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:52,458
What?

426
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,417
You say different names.

427
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:55,917
Are you a lawyer?

428
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,542
Keep on questioning me!

429
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,667
You ask more questions for
the money you gave.

430
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:01,208
You are naughty.

431
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:01,917
Okay,

432
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,583
Did you feed me all this days?

433
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,042
Okay...
What do you eat?

434
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,542
A quarter and water,

435
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,667
...with bit pickle.

436
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:13,333
Will lay down after that.

437
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,125
So pride!

438
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,542
When you talk hue being
a doll,

439
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,333
If you have life

440
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,292
How you'll be?

441
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:18,625
Hmm,

442
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,792
I'll do,

443
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:20,208
What i say.

444
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:28,750
Take it brother.

445
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you want to taste ice?

446
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,417
We don't want ice,
We wish to take a ride.

447
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,083
Only ride!

448
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,000
Sure I'll do.

449
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,083
Afore that you all taste
the ice.

450
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,292
I'll get for ride then.
-I must go for a ride.

451
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,750
If you wish,
you go ahead.

452
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,667
I didn't mention that.

453
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:42,208
Give the ice.

454
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,667
In whose money are
you buying?

455
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:45,750
What toy you gave?

456
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,333
It talks mischievous.

457
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,042
Does it talk mischievous?

458
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:49,667
Yes.
-Give it.

459
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,667
Pulse is normal.

460
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,000
Is the shit normal.

461
00:17:59,042 --> 00:17:59,667
Did you talk too smart?

462
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:00,417
No.

463
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,083
She only spoke too smart.

464
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:03,917
You shouldn't talk that way.

465
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,333
She bought you for money,

466
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,750
Owner of you.

467
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,000
It talks good.

468
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:08,333
Then what?

469
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:11,208
I reverts mischievous,
when I talk.

470
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,792
Did you press the red button?
-Yes.

471
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,792
It's wrong.

472
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,083
It has six modes.

473
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:18,875
This one is wrong.

474
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,417
Sorry...

475
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,042
Sorry...

476
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,167
You press only
the yellow button.

477
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:23,792
Okay?

478
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,500
Hello,it's not yellow.

479
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,292
It's green!

480
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:27,917
I was taught in my school
as yellow.

481
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,958
So it won't talk mischievous
hereafter.

482
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:30,083
Yes,

483
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,083
If so...
Tell to it's dad.

484
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:32,958
You mean dad!

485
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:33,792
Hmm.
-Who is that?

486
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:34,542
Chitti Robo!

487
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,167
Chitti Robo?
Yes,it's village robo.

488
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:38,958
Get lost.

489
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:41,667
Is it okay now?

490
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:44,083
Come on...

491
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,000
They cheat him well.

492
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,375
Hey,give my share.

493
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,542
I'll give you.

494
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,208
Don't cheat me
as cheating her.

495
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,250
Give me the money.
I won't cheat you, come on.

496
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,167
An announcement to the public.

497
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,375
Our chairman is coming to do
rituals to the goddess.

498
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:01,333
We are proud to inform it.

499
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,917
Hey,
it must be crowded inside.

500
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,083
You stay out with the child.

501
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:19,542
Okay,

502
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,167
You come.

503
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,292
Why do you stop her?

504
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:22,542
Let her come in.

505
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,208
You be quite.
I know all. Come on.

506
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:27,792
Be safe with the child.

507
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,750
Everyone comes with family
to the carnival,

508
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,292
But leaves someone in return.

509
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,500
Don't cry...

510
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,875
A child only knows the mind
of another child.

511
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,292
Girl,come here.

512
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:14,542
Don't cry.

513
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,417
Tell me,uncle.
-Very good!

514
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,458
Will you stop him crying?

515
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,417
Try now.

516
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,833
My gem!

517
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,542
If you want him to
stop crying,

518
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:24,500
Give a toy.

519
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,083
You expect a bribe

520
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,083
...at this tender age!

521
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,083
Not this one,uncle.
That toy!

522
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:36,000
That big one.

523
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You want the deer!

524
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:38,333
You are smart enough.

525
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:39,625
Take it.

526
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,375
Not this,that one.

527
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,542
Take it.

528
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,458
Stop him crying.

529
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,750
Take it. Stop him crying.
-Not this.

530
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:46,375
Take it.

531
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,792
Take everything.

532
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,125
Take everything.
Okay.

533
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:53,917
Yes.
-Stop him crying.

534
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:54,667
Come here.

535
00:20:55,042 --> 00:20:56,292
Brother,
what's your name?

536
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,958
Reply to your sister.
-What's your name?

537
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,625
If you ask him with
stuffed mouth.

538
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:02,917
How can he understand?

539
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,375
Now ask him.

540
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,208
What happened?
Why do you cry now?

541
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:07,167
You be silent for sometime.

542
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,667
Don't throw the toys.
I'll mock you.

543
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,083
I'm struggling.

544
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:14,667
Do you want chocolate?

545
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,750
I'll buy you.
Please get up.

546
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,583
I'll mock the remaining teeth.

547
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,333
It's all because of you.

548
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,083
Get up!

549
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,583
I'll buy everything.

550
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,542
Everyone is busy in business.

551
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,917
I got stuck up with them.

552
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,208
God!

553
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,083
Hey,what's going on here?

554
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:49,583
I don't know
whose kids are both.

555
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,167
They don't stop crying.

556
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:57,083
Both are crying for no reason

557
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,292
I can't manage them.

558
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,833
Do you want them
to stop crying?

559
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,583
Yes.

560
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:03,792
Get up.

561
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:04,417
Get up.

562
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:05,583
Lift me.

563
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:07,583
Look at my eyes.

564
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,375
It's good.

565
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,375
Why do you hit me?

566
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,833
Hey tiny pests!

567
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,500
They laughed!

568
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:20,542
Come here.

569
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,625
I'll thrash you.

570
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:23,583
You come here.

571
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:25,208
What's your name?

572
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:25,833
Sadhana.

573
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:26,750
Sadhana.!

574
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:29,125
Hey,

575
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:30,500
Do you know Dora?

576
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:31,125
Yes,I know.

577
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,167
Keep it.

578
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,083
Where is your mother?

579
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,083
In bangles shop.

580
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:35,583
Will you go safe?

581
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:35,833
Yes.

582
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:36,625
Go...

583
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,917
I'll mock you.Go away.

584
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:41,083
What's your name?

585
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:41,833
Venkatesh.

586
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,417
Venkatesh.

587
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,375
Venkatesh.
Venkatesh!

588
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:48,750
I'm searching for you.

589
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:50,208
Where did you go?

590
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:51,458
Thank you very much.

591
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,083
Is he your child?

592
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:53,792
No,

593
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,667
My aunt's.
-Aunt?

594
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,667
He is not a child,a bug!

595
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:58,667
He took away my life.

596
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,625
Will you let free
the child in carnival?

597
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:02,292
No,

598
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,125
I was at temple.
He left running.

599
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,625
Get him safe.

600
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:08,500
Good, I found you!

601
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:09,750
Just a minute.

602
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:11,417
What?

603
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,583
Don't give him.
He is acting.

604
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:15,667
Take it.

605
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:16,667
He got.

606
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:17,750
Okay?

607
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:18,917
Bye!

608
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,167
Tell him bye.
-Bye.

609
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:21,958
-Bye.

610
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:31,958
Brother,

611
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,917
I can't bear the hot sun,
as I'm sitting for a long time.

612
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,042
Will you ride or not?

613
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,167
Waiting for three seats to be filled.
I'll start then.

614
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:41,375
Why are you in hurry?

615
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:43,417
It's enough of three persons.

616
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,333
Oh god!

617
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:53,500
Bro,come here.

618
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:54,792
Come here.

619
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:57,958
You seem to be a good person.
Just go for a round once.

620
00:23:58,542 --> 00:23:59,208
Just a round!

621
00:23:59,250 --> 00:23:59,792
I'll do.

622
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,542
What did you do now?

623
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:04,458
You asked me for a round.

624
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,875
Not me,
i mean't a round in that.

625
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:07,750
That's your work.

626
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,250
But you ask others to do.

627
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:11,500
Am I looking like a fool?

628
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:12,667
Do you know about my generation?

629
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:13,000
Go away.

630
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,375
Do you know about my generation?

631
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,000
Is he a mad?

632
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:18,750
What to do?

633
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,208
My blood pressure is raising
in this hot sun.

634
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,292
Sister,please wait.

635
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:24,875
You are irritating me.

636
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,125
Oh god!

637
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,750
Whether it spins or not my head spins!

638
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:30,125
Bro,

639
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,875
Bro,
why didn't you operate it?

640
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,292
What to do?

641
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,833
If one person sits in,
other exit.

642
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:36,792
To balance the weight
is the problem.

643
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:37,708
You mean weight?

644
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:38,958
I'll step in.
It'll be balanced.

645
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,750
Thank you very much.

646
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:43,333
One guy came!

647
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:44,958
How to get two others?

648
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,625
Be careful,

649
00:24:56,958 --> 00:24:57,750
You may get caught of fire.

650
00:24:58,417 --> 00:24:59,542
This is his life.

651
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,208
Don't burn it.

652
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,458
How long he made us
to wait in hot sun?

653
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:08,292
Just wait...
-I don't want.

654
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,292
She too left.

655
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:13,250
If one steps in, other goes out.

656
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,250
What to do?

657
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:15,792
Brother...

658
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:17,333
He is Murugan...

659
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:19,833
You're my saviour...

660
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:22,875
Come on...Come on...

661
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:23,667
Take it brother.

662
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:24,500
Very good.

663
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:25,375
Step in.

664
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:26,250
Why?

665
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:26,833
Step in aside.

666
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,750
I need to exchange the amount.

667
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:31,708
Didn't you come for a ride?

668
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:33,167
No,why should I?

669
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,667
Only one round,please.
-No,i won't.

670
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,667
Give me the money.

671
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,458
Only one seat,please.

672
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,792
No,i won't.

673
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,875
I didn't even have my breakfast.
Come on.

674
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,292
Please come,just one seat is vacant.
If one seat,you can go and sit.

675
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:46,875
Is it there?

676
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,833
Swapna sundari get caught!

677
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,333
Yes,do you hesitate
to sit next to her?

678
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:51,458
I'll change her seat.

679
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:53,417
Hey you go that side...
-No... no...

680
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,167
I'll sit.

681
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:54,667
Will you sit?

682
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:55,542
It's only because of your sake.

683
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:55,958
It's for my sake.

684
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,958
Not for others.

685
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:58,958
I'm coming dear.

686
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,375
I'l mock you.
-Why?

687
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:04,917
Don't you know
to go by the steps?

688
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:08,167
Don't stop the on going carnival.

689
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,875
I must start rotating it soon.

690
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,125
Get in fast.

691
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,333
Yes.

692
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:14,292
Written something here.

693
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,875
What's that?

694
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,125
Those who have that problems
shouldn't go this ride.

695
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:23,667
Then you must ride with birds.

696
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,167
Still one issue is
not written in it.

697
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:25,917
What's that?

698
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,292
Those who have dental caries
shouldn't go.

699
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,667
Don't be louder.
Everyone will get down.

700
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,208
Then one thing.
-What?

701
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:34,417
If it goes round,
i'll feel drowsy.

702
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:35,625
So go flat.

703
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,625
We'll go to graveyard then,
is it okay?

704
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,167
I have to go there only,
if i prefer a ride in it.

705
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:40,542
Save me...
-What?

706
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:41,625
Sorry,Sorry,

707
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,042
It's a new sort of travel.

708
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:45,667
Move on...move on...

709
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:47,000
Pandi...

710
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:50,125
Your compartment is superb!

711
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,833
My compartment is little bit jerky.

712
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,792
All passengers,be careful and,

713
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,500
...be in control of your body.

714
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:57,917
I'm here for survival of my life.

715
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:01,458
I've clean up my mind
with dettol.

716
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,375
How about others,
Phenyl or dettol?

717
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:04,958
By footwear.

718
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,208
How'll you clean with footwear
instead of broomstick?

719
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:07,958
What?

720
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:08,958
Nothing.

721
00:27:08,958 --> 00:27:09,875
What do you look at?

722
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:10,542
Start spinning.

723
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,667
You shut your mouth.

724
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:25,958
Hello,

725
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,417
Everyone listen here.

726
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,625
This chain is of five sovereigns.

727
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:29,542
I'll throw it down now.

728
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,375
If anyone dares to take it,
i'll give whatever they wish.

729
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,542
See now!

730
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,083
My money...

731
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,083
Stop it.

732
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,542
Stop it.

733
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,708
Hey,don't take it.

734
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,375
if you take it, i'll slay you.

735
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:54,875
Stop...stop...

736
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:57,542
Hey pandi tell him to stop.

737
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,167
Hey..Hey...

738
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:10,625
Dude,

739
00:28:11,042 --> 00:28:14,125
You have become
"Chain Pandi," now!

740
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:16,792
You ask for something best!

741
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,292
Can't survive by selling toys!

742
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:18,958
Hmm...

743
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:21,667
Ask her...

744
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:22,917
Ask her boldly.

745
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,542
Hello,
-What?

746
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,042
Come near.

747
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:27,500
I can hear you.Tell me.
What?

748
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:28,542
I called her.
Go away...

749
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,542
I thought you'll give it.

750
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:31,250
Come near.

751
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,542

Stop it.

914
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,542
It's not a playground.

915
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,875
Either you give it or
let give others the chance.
-Yes,

Gifted Rs.2000!

934
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:25,167
We bless him and his family
to be healthy and prosperous.

935
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:27,250
Hey...

936
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:31,417
You denied me the money
but given her?

937
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:31,667
Hey,

938
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:32,708
I was with you,

939
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:33,417
Then when i gave her?

940
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,667
Then how she announced?

941
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't know.

942
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:36,625
Let's go and ask her.

943
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:40,292
When did i give you money?

944
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:41,417
Why do you bless me?

945
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,917
I'm not saying for fun.

946
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:47,208
That girl asked me to tell,

947
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:48,083
by giving money.

948
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:50,792
Hey,

949
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,083
why did you do it?

950
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:52,875
What i did?

951
00:36:53,708 --> 00:36:54,542
I don't have a family.

952
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:55,958
Then how come
wife and children?

953
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,208
You have a family.

954
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,333
I'm not married yet,
then how?

955
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,875
You are married
three days ago!

956
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,250
Are you married
three days before?

957
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,083
You didn't give me sweets.

958
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:05,542
To me?

959
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,208
Let it be,
who is your wife?

960
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:07,792
Hey...

961
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:09,625
I'm his wife!

962
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:12,000
Are you mad?

963
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:15,167
We survive in the carnivals.

964
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,792
But you conduct the carnivals.

965
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:20,333
We both are not a good match.

966
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:21,333
Bye.

967
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:22,333
Let's go.

968
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,500
You mention as his wife,

969
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,667
but he left neglectful.

970
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:28,125
Where he'll go?

971
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:28,875
Let's see.

972
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,708
Don't thrash me.

973
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:36,417
How dare you ask me?
-Don't thrash me.

974
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,542
How dare you ask me?

975
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:39,667
Why do you thrash him?

976
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:40,250
Hey,

977
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:41,917
Ask him the reason.

978
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:42,542
Why does he thrash you?

979
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:43,667
He asked for roasted grains.

980
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:44,500
Did you give him?

981
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:45,500
Yes,brother.

982
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:46,000
Ate it?

983
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,958
Yes.
Then what?

984
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,000
I told you to ask him.

985
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,167
Why did he thrash you?

986
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,375
I asked for money.

987
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:54,167
Don't you have mind?

988
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:58,250
He asked money for
what you ate.

989
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,208
Aren't you ashamed?

990
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:00,750
Hey,

991
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:02,042
It's not the fault of asking money.

992
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,542
Modesty is important.

993
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:04,792
Respect is important.

994
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:06,667
I didn't buy it just by
wearing a shirt.

995
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,542
Ask him to tell his modulation?

996
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
How did you ask?

997
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:11,542
Give the money for roasted grains?

998
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,500
Who you call as rogue?

999
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,958
Am i looking like a rogue?

1000
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:18,750
Stop it.
I'll kill you.

1001
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,792
Leave me.
I'll kill him today.

1002
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,125
Leave him.
Don't hit.

1003
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,292
Is this your problem?
-Yes brother.

1004
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,625
oh no...

1005
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:29,708
For example,
if you buy dates...

1006
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:29,875
Hmm...

1007
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,708
He'll ask the money
for dates.

1008
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:32,000
Hmm...

1009
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:33,167
If you buy halwa,

1010
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:33,500
Hmm...

1011
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:34,833
He'll ask the money for halwa.

1012
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,375
If you buy this peanuts,

1013
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:37,875
He'll ask the money for it.

1014
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:39,000
The same way,

1015
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:39,375
Roasted grain,

1016
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,875
If you buy the roasted grain,

1017
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,417
He'll ask the money
for roasted grain.

1018
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,958
If i be a fool,

1019
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,250
you'll ask for it.

1020
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,250
What do you look at?

1021
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:52,083
I'll mock you on the head.

1022
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:55,167
You always interfere in
my matters.

1023
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:56,958
Are you a councillor?

1024
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,000
Will you ever interfere?

1025
00:38:58,542 --> 00:39:00,500
Why do you stare?
Catch him.

1026
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:05,792
He left.

1027
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,208
I'll maintain it today.

1028
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:12,208
What are you looking?

1029
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,167
You must conjoin me
with him.

1030
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:14,708
Hey,

1031
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,125
I'm his friend.

1032
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,500
Not his uncle.

1033
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,958
I don't know all that.

1034
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:20,500
You must support me

1035
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,250
He won't listen to me ever.

1036
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,917
Then you give me your dress.

1037
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:27,625
For what?
To wash?

1038
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:28,333
Let it be.

1039
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,250
To tear it.
-What?

1040
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,542
To tear?

1041
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:32,833
What's your problem?

1042
00:39:33,292 --> 00:39:34,542
It's not a very casual dress.

1043
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:35,958
I bought it in surat.

1044
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:36,458
Oh...

1045
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,292
It's branded!

1046
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,542
Rs.2000!

1047
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,708
I can buy two sets of dress!

1048
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:47,167
Don't want?

1049
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:47,667
It's okay.

1050
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:49,667
Give me.

1051
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:52,000
I'll give it immediately.

1052
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,375
Hey....

1053
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:53,708
Go somewhere.

1054
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,083
Hello...Hello...
It's a public place.

1055
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,500
I'm packed quite good.

1056
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,125
Turn aside.

1057
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:06,458
Take it.

1058
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:08,292
Okay.

1059
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,042
Stop... stop...

1060
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,542
So intelligent you are!

1061
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,875
Taking away the money also.
Go...

1062
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:21,958
Hey,

1063
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:23,500
have you slept?

1064
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:26,958
Expecting you'll accompany me
for drinks,

1065
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:28,375
I was waiting.

1066
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:31,083
It's okay,

1067
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:34,292
I too didn't take.

1068
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:44,125
Hey,

1069
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,458
Why that girl mentioned

1070
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,125
as husband and wife?

1071
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:51,208
Hey,

1072
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:52,542
are you listening?

1073
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,042
Nothing is understandable.

1074
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,333
Everything seems to be
multiples.

1075
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:02,458
But one thing,

1076
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:04,750
I wish to tell you a truth.

1077
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:05,792
Tell me.

1078
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:06,833
Hey,

1079
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:08,542
Are you dreaming?

1080
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:13,542
You was about to say something,

1081
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:14,833
Tell that.

1082
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:16,250
You was about to say something,

1083
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:17,417
Tell me,please.
-What do you do here?

1084
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:20,000
Get up.

1085
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:21,125
You tell me first.

1086
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:22,292
Why did you come here?

1087
00:41:22,708 --> 00:41:23,667
I gave you Rs.2000,

1088
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:24,875
She pin pointed me.

1089
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:25,417
Get up.

1090
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:26,542
Get out first.

1091
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:28,542
Go out.

1092
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:29,792
It'll be mistaken
if anyone see us.

1093
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,333
I don't bother about that.

1094
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:32,333
You was about to say
something.

1095
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,667
Tell me that.
-I don't have anything to tell.

1096
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:34,250
You go out.

1097
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:35,708
I won't go.

1098
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:36,083
No.

1099
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:40,333
Oh sinner!

1100
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,542
Did you get my dress
for this?

1101
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,292
Hey,look at there!

1102
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,750
She is the village
chairman's daughter.

1103
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,000
How dare she is?

1104
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:55,333
Nothing happened inside,
isn't it?

1105
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:56,625
How does she wear
your dress?

1106
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:59,667
She gave me money,

1107
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:02,167
I gave her the dress and
spent it.

1108
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:04,833
It's a shame to the village.

1109
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:05,542
Hey,

1110
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:06,542
Everyone has witnessed.

1111
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,208
If her father knows,

1112
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:09,250
It'll be a problem.

1113
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:11,792
I'll thrash you.

1114
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:23,125
Have you packed the toys safe?

1115
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:29,625
Sent everything in Velu's vehicle.

1116
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:32,500
Good if everything reach safely.
-Check whether the bus comes?

1117
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:40,500
What?

1118
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,250
What a pity it is?

1119
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:54,875
I did a blunder.

1120
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,167
A life has lost because of me.

1121
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,708
Is she known to you?

1122
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:03,958
Yes.

1123
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:05,083
A good girl.

1124
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,458
Didn't expect
she'll take this decision.

1125
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,125
She brawled with her
step mother

1126
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,042
and eloped with the
toy-seller in overnight.

1127
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,042
Her father decided as
she was dead

1128
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:15,750
and put this poster.

1129
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:16,917
Only girl!

1130
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,625
She the made entire village
to laugh at her.

1131
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:24,042
Dude,within a few minutes
my heart got shivered.

1132
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:26,333
Hmm...

1133
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:28,917
Hey pandi,

1134
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:32,292
She knows we go to
many "Village carnivals" for survival.

1135
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:35,000
She must've went somewhere
in search of us.

1136
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:35,667
Yes.

1137
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:37,500
tomorrow the carnival is
at "Karunkuzhi

1138
00:43:37,708 --> 00:43:38,500
She must've gone there.

1139
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,042
Let's go.

1140
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,750
An announcement to the public.

1141
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:24,542
Six milk pots were left unattended.

1142
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,250
Those who own that must

1143
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:30,833
identify rightly and get it.

1144
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:32,500
The event at 3p.m

1145
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:36,083
We request the devotees
to be ready

1146
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:39,167
We request the policemen
to help us.

1147
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:40,083
What do you want?

1148
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:41,708
"I'm Nadhiya,"

1149
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:43,458
from "Arasankudi."

1150
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:46,083
I'm searching for "Pandi,
a toy seller."

1151
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,292
He sells the toys of deer.

1152
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:49,958
I need an announcement for him.

1153
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,958
One more announcement...

1154
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:54,042
Nadhiya from Arasankudi

1155
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,750
Has come in search of Pandi,
a toy seller.

1156
00:44:55,875 --> 00:45:01,208
We request Pandi to come to
the spot of announcement.

1157
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,458
Don't cry.

1158
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:12,500
Why do you break out!

1159
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:14,708
Don't cry on an auspicious day.

1160
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:17,083
I'll announce it again
for your sake.

1161
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:19,417
Pandi,where are you?

1162
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,542
Don't let a beautiful girl
to cry.

1163
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:25,042
Come soon to the spot
of announcement.

1164
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:31,458
Hey,who are you all?

1165
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:34,375
What do you want?

1166
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,792
You insisted that
"she is a beautiful girl,"

1167
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:37,875
So,came to see her.

1168
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:40,958
I'll hit you.
Go away.

1169
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:41,917
Who are you?

1170
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:43,333
My girl friend name is
also "Nadhiya."

1171
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:44,708
She must be my Mrs.

1172
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:48,208
But it was just missed.
-It's good she got missed.

1173
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:50,083
Came here for no reason.

1174
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:50,750
Hello,

1175
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,792
I announced it twice.

1176
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,208
Except him all others are coming.

1177
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,542
He may come at dusk
if not now.

1178
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:02,167
Our goddess is very powerful.

1179
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,125
Pray to her.

1180
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,250
Sure,you'll find him.

1181
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,000
Everything will happen good.
-Thank you brother.

1182
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:08,000
Mari,

1183
00:46:08,125 --> 00:46:08,417
What?

1184
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:09,958
How many times to call you?

1185
00:46:10,042 --> 00:46:10,708
Can't you hear?

1186
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:13,083
You are drunk all the time.
-Yes.

1187
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:14,083
When we don't have water
to drink,

1188
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,875
You get to drink alcohol.

1189
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:17,250
Look at him.

1190
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,042
Are you looking beautiful?

1191
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:26,500
This cap is so strong.

1192
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,250
No one is here to announce.

1193
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,208
Sir is here.

1194
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,458
Hello...

1195
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:32,458
Hello...

1196
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:33,000
Yes.

1197
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:33,625
Sir,

1198
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,417
Open the cap of bottle.

1199
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:36,458
Will you open

1200
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:37,542
Open it.

1201
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:45,542
Hey,it's not bottle.
It's mic!

1202
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,208
Don't i know that
it's monitor stuff?

1203
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:48,625
He must be a habitual drunkard.

1204
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,208
Hey,

1205
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:50,417
I'm not the crackers man.

1206
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,917
The crackers show is outside.

1207
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,875
I must do a announcement.

1208
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:55,917
Go to meet accountant for
the accounts.

1209
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,250
What? Accounts?

1210
00:46:57,667 --> 00:46:59,083
Oh,you want to do
an announcement?

1211
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:00,625
Can't you say it clearly?

1212
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,667
Are you drunk?

1213
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,667
He is a different drunkard.

1214
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:04,958
Reverts opposite to what we say.

1215
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:07,375
I guessed his type.

1216
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:09,333
Now,i'll handle him in his way.

1217
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:10,833
Bro,

1218
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:13,375
A guy known to us was missed

1219
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,167
Oh,is a girl was missed?

1220
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:16,625
Yes brother.

1221
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,208
What's her name?

1222
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:19,333
Name?

1223
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,167
Nithiya!

1224
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:22,458
Nadhiya?

1225
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:23,250
How is it?

1226
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:23,917
Yes brother.

1227
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:25,042
See now...see now...

1228
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,833
Do the announcement.
-I'll do now.

1229
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:30,000
Hey,
Hey,

1230
00:47:30,542 --> 00:47:32,542
You'll die with electric shock
if you keep that in mouth.

1231
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:33,917
Mic is here.

1232
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:34,792
Is it mic?

1233
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:35,750
Drunkard!

1234
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:39,167
Take it.

1235
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:41,542
Hold straight to your mouth.

1236
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:42,750
Tell now.

1237
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:48,542
Shall I call "Lord Muruga?"

1238
00:47:49,542 --> 00:47:51,083
No need.

1239
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,083
Show the photo.

1240
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:53,083
Have you seen this girl?

1241
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,958
She looks beautiful.

1242
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:07,542
Why his mouth gets vibrated?

1243
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:13,542
After looking at this photo,
everyone seems to be the same.

1244
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:18,542
What's he blabbering about?

1245
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,042
Am i in good condition?

1246
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:22,917
Is it a dream?

1247
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:23,667
Hey,

1248
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:25,542
Are you watching a movie?

1249
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:26,542
useless fellow!

1250
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:27,917
Get lost.

1251
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,625
You yell at me!

1252
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:31,917
Then whom?
You yell at me coming to my zone.

1253
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:32,917
It's you...

1254
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:36,917
My Lord! My Lord!

1255
00:48:48,167 --> 00:48:51,875
I can't hear the orchestra.

1256
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,708
The world is getting dark.

1257
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:56,167
Brother...

1258
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,292
Brother...

1259
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,500
Where is the toys shop?

1260
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:01,542
Do you ask for bus?

1261
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,958
Buses won't come
to the carnival ground.

1262
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,333
That goes in bypass.

1263
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:09,083
Where the toys of deer
will be sold?

1264
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:11,167
You mean bullock carts?

1265
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,667
Nowadays you can't see that.

1266
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:15,125
It was in olden days.

1267
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:16,875
Brother,

1268
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:20,208
where is the toy's shop?

1269
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:25,167
I can see your lip movement.
But nothing can be heard of.

1270
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,750
I can hear only some sound.

1271
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:28,708
What do you talk with a deaf?

1272
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,250
Didn't you find him yet?

1273
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:32,292
No brother.

1274
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:34,250
Today is the last day
of the carnival.

1275
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:37,042
Tomorrow it's in,
"Thagam theerthapuram Village,"

1276
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:38,250
A biggest carnival.

1277
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:39,875
All the nearby villagers
comes there.

1278
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,667
You better look for him there.

1279
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,375
What's the name of the place?

1280
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:45,500
"Thagam theerthapuram."

1281
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:14,833
They halted the carnival
because of the arson.

1282
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,917
A peacock has fainted,
you all looking at her idle.

1283
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,083
Go and get soda water.

1284
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:44,125
We don't have money.

1285
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,417
Tell them my name,
"Magizhchi Minor."

1286
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:48,542
Even though they ask
for money.

1287
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:50,542
Share the money you have
and get it.

1288
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:51,167
Go soon.

1289
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:52,292
Still he lives in the past.

1290
00:50:52,292 --> 00:50:54,333
She looks so charming like
"silk smitha."

1291
00:50:58,708 --> 00:50:59,542
Where is the key?

1292
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I opened it.

1293
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,833
I must open it.
Why did you do my work?

1294
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:05,458
Pour it.

1295
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:17,875
A song from the movie
"7G RAINBOW COLONY,"

1296
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,458
Who are you?

1297
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:28,833
"Magizhchi."

1298
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:30,042
Okay,

1299
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:30,875

That's my name.

1301
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:33,417
"Magizhchi Minor,"

1302
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:35,458
I won't ever shed tears and

1303
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:36,958
Won't let others also to
shed tears.

1304
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:38,500
Everyone must be happy ever...

1305
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:39,417
That is my policy.

1306
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,208
Who are you?

1307
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:42,458
I'm Nadhiya,

1308
00:51:42,917 --> 00:51:43,542
Came for the carnival.

1309
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,083
Nadhiya,!

1310
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:47,958
Good name!
It's nice.

1311
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,333
Minor,
you are called in the panchayat.

1312
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:51,542
I didn't do anything
except splashing soda water.

1313
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:52,083
Minor,

1314
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:53,708
You are the Panchayat head.

1315
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:54,708
You have to talk.

1316
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:55,875
Yes,i'm the Panchayat head!

1317
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:57,208
I'm the Panchayat head!

1318
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:58,167
Go, i'll come.

1319
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:00,083
I'll be back soon.

1320
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:01,167
Hey,

1321
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:01,625
Hey,

1322
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:02,125
Hey,

1323
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:03,375
Stop the carnival.

1324
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,208
Stop the carnival.

1325
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:08,208
The whole village is
under the caste arson.

1326
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,000
How to conduct the carnival?

1327
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:12,208
Shall we apply the goddess
kumkum

1328
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:14,875
or your blood in the forehead?

1329
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:16,958
So no carnival at present year.

1330
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,667
It's the judgement of minor.

1331
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:21,083
Will the carnival
proceed only if he decides!

1332
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,083
Minor!

1333
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:22,917
One minute please.

1334
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:24,500
Nadhiya!

1335
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,667
How come you be here?

1336
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,000
It's okay,
tell me.

1337
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,667
If you plan good,

1338
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,167
You can conduct this carnival
without shedding blood.

1339
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,125
How you got this belief?

1340
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:33,833
By looking at your nose!

1341
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:37,625
Belief comes by looking
at eyes.

1342
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:39,458
How come by looking at the nose?

1343
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:40,917
Anyhow,it's okay.

1344
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:41,875
We'll do.

1345
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:42,417
Hmm

1346
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:43,125
Minor,

1347
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,542
Is the Panchayat to your nose
or to the chariot?

1348
00:52:44,625 --> 00:52:45,375
Don't touch my nose.

1349
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,458
I'll break your nose,
but it's bleeding afore.

1350
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:47,833
Hey,

1351
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:48,667
Mindless guys.

1352
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:49,667
Minor!

1353
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,208
Minor!

1354
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,167
It's all because of you.

1355
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:53,083
It's all because of you.

1356
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:55,833
If my judgement goes wrong,

1357
00:52:56,042 --> 00:52:57,792
Can't you say that I'm wrong?

1358
00:52:58,125 --> 00:52:59,125
You are not uttering a word.

1359
00:53:01,292 --> 00:53:04,292
Goddess came in the
form of this girl

1360
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,667
and told me to change the decision.

1361
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,500
We'll call the policemen for security.

1362
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:12,792
If a question arises as either
the humans or goddess is important?

1363
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,083
The goddess is important.

1364
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:15,958
So,conduct the carnival.

1365
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:16,917
Put the posters,

1366
00:53:17,125 --> 00:53:18,833
in the name of the minor.

1367
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,875
Will you put the posters
in all places?

1368
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:21,792
If you wish,

1369
00:53:22,167 --> 00:53:23,833
i'll put the poster
in Pakistan border also.

1370
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:31,667
How dare you pasted the poster
on my leader's?

1371
00:53:37,542 --> 00:53:38,500
Stop the carnival.

1372
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:41,417
It's the only carnival now.

1373
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:42,750
It seems they'll stop it.

1374
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:55,750
"I'm Karuppaswamy,"

1375
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:01,917
Do you brawl in front of
the lord?

1376
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
What's the purpose my lord?

1377
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,500
Who told to stop the carnival?

1378
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,458
Who is it?

1379
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,167
He only told.

1380
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:10,125
Come here.

1381
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:10,875
Come here.

1382
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:13,500
Give him the penalty.

1383
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:19,542
Do you think the chariot as
your car?

1384
00:54:19,542 --> 00:54:20,667
No my lord!

1385
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:24,375
To drive and to stop as
you wish?

1386
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:25,792
It's mine!

1387
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:29,875
Lord,forgive him.
We'll follow your instructions.

1388
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:31,250
Tell us my lord!

1389
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:33,417
Tell us my lord!
Tell us my lord!

1390
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:36,458
He splashed in my face!

1391
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:37,458
Move the chariot...

1392
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,917
Let the carnival start!

1393
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:44,125
What happened?

1394
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:47,250
Everything is done.

1395
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:48,833
All are in fear.

1396
00:54:48,833 --> 00:54:50,250
I'll ask them a banner
for me.

1397
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:51,375
You go and meet her.

1398
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:52,208
Go...Go...

1399
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:58,958
My lord,who are you?
Who are you?

1400
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:01,083
You have come over here,
Who are you?

1401
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,125
He is my brother,"Karuppan."

1402
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,250
I'm his elder "Muniyandi,"

1403
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:07,083
Welcome brother...

1404
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:09,375
Why have you come
after a long span?

1405
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:12,417
Am I "Kabali Rajini..."
to come after a long span?

1406
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:14,542
I'm "Viirumandi,"
-You mean "Virumandi?"

1407
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,667
Sorry,"Muniyandi..."

1408
00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:18,708
Lord,

Take it.

1413
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:27,958
Get the blessings.

1414
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:31,083
Show me your head.

1415
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:35,125
Water flows on.

1416
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,458
Coconut broken by mistake.
It's a sin.

1417
00:55:39,042 --> 00:55:39,958
Lord moves on...

1418
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,167
Lord moves on...

1419
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,208
Sorry,Muniyandi...

1420
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:49,750
Lord,as you have come
after a long span,

1421
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:50,292
Yes.

1422
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,625
The people have to give
their offerings.

1423
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:54,042
Offerings?

1424
00:55:54,375 --> 00:55:56,500
Is this the chain?
-It'll be big than the chain.

1425
00:55:56,542 --> 00:55:58,375
Give it...

1426
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:01,208
Piercing the trident in the mouth,
-Give it...

1427
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:02,833
you broke the coconut
on the head.

1428
00:56:03,542 --> 00:56:08,250
I shouldn't see you in this carnival.
-No,don't hit me.

1429
00:56:22,042 --> 00:56:26,542
“Where did you go? Where did you go?”

“I sway as a kite as if it's thread was cut.”

1439
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,667
Brother,Where did you buy it?

1440
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,417
“You are the words uttered…”

1441
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:46,542
“You are my affinity,”

1442
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:51,458
“If not,What else I’ll do?”

1443
00:57:51,458 --> 00:58:00,750
“I was waiting with a garland,
but the situation led you to leave me!”

1444
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:05,375
“You come in my dreams,
I get dissolve in my tears,”

1445
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:09,917
“I don’t aspire this life.”

1446
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:14,417
“Where did you go? Where did you go?”

1447

01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:06,417
Variety of toys!

1479
01:00:07,292 --> 01:00:10,375
Come on ladies and gentlemen!

1480
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:13,958
Variety of toys!

1481
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:18,292
Come on ladies and gentlemen!

1482
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,000
Why did you do this?

1483
01:00:35,417 --> 01:00:38,500
Isn't it wrong to leave the house
and roam around places?

1484
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:41,083
Come on.

1485
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:42,125
i'll drop you in house.

1486
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:43,000
Come on.

1487
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,292
Stop!

1488
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,542
I didn't come on my own.

1489
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,458
Your soul made me to come!

1490
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,833
Instead of being with a
hatred person,

1491
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:53,292
It's good to give my life

1492
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:54,708
To a person i love!

1493
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:56,500
...and my countenance to another?

1494
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,875
Only two options for us,

1495
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,958
Either we must elope...

1496
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:01,542
If not?

1497
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,792
Or you must marry me.

1498
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:06,500
What are you looking at?

1499
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:10,667
If you reject with
reasons now,

1500
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,542
I'll kill you and myself too.

1501
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:15,500
Hey

1502
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,417
Come let's go.

1503
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:17,083
Where?

1504
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,042
To sell the toys.

1505
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:19,708
You know only that.

1506
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:23,000
She knows well that
you roam around places...

1507
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:25,208
...but she searched for you
and has come here.

1508
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:27,042
Can't you understand her heart?

1509
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:29,625
By selling toys,
Your heart too has become a toy!

1510
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:30,500
Go away.

1511
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:33,625
You understood me.

1512
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:34,458
What's this?

1513
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:35,625
Hey,

1514
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:36,792
Look here,

1515
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:38,458
She is from a reputed family.

1516
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:40,667
For the sake of in love,

1517
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:41,708
she falls on my feet.

1518
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:42,542
That's what i too mention.

1519
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:43,625
She is from a rich family.

1520
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,292
How can she expect
a good life with me?

1521
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,542
I love her more
than she loves me.

1522
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:54,083
That's why!

1523
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:57,333
Only i wish her a good life.

1524
01:01:57,417 --> 01:01:57,542
Hey,

1525
01:01:58,208 --> 01:01:59,458
That's not love.

1526
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:01,958
She left everything for you.

1527
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:03,167
That's the love!

1528
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:07,292
Hai,

1529
01:02:08,417 --> 01:02:12,417
Her father sent her out
and did homage too.

1530
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,417
Where she'll go now?

1531
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:17,667
Hey,

1532
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:18,792
See here.

1533
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,292
Go to Madras
and get her married.

1534
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,500
Lead a good life there.

1535
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,542
We'll see after a few days.

1536
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:29,333
Don't hesitate.

1537
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:30,250
You'll be blessed good.

1538
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:38,875
On that day,
we both came together.

1539
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:41,458
Again he left me.

1540
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:43,708
I'll find out him,
if it's my place.

1541
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:46,208
But,I don't know anyone here.

1542
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:48,542
Homage was done
to me in my house.

1543
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:50,917
That's why,

1544
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:52,625
i decided to die.

1545
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:54,958
For that?

1546
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:56,667
Will you die for it?

1547
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:58,250
We must live and achieve.

1548
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:00,125
Leave it.

1549
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:01,000
In confused stage,

1550
01:03:01,417 --> 01:03:02,292
Our decisions will be wrong.

1551
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:04,375
I stay in a relief room.

1552
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:05,833
You too can stay there.

1553
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:08,000
I'll find out your Pandi...

1554
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:10,000
Why must you suffer for me?

1555
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:12,417
You said he resembles me,
We'll find out him.

1556
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:14,208
Come,let's go.

1557
01:03:19,167 --> 01:03:19,292
Give it.

1558
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:20,375
It's okay.

1559
01:03:21,292 --> 01:03:21,458
Come...

1560
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:32,500
Hey,

1561
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:34,083
I'm Baasha,

1562
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:34,958
you are Antony.

1563
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:37,042
Fight is between you and me.

1564
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:39,125
Either you must be here or I!

1565
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:42,583
My way is different!

1566
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:46,875
God proposes,
Arunachalam concludes!

1567
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:49,417
Radha...O Radha...
-Hello

1568
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:51,375
What happened to you?

1569
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:53,958
Nothing.

1570
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:54,917
What are you doing here?

1571
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:56,500
Go to sleep.

1572
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:58,167
No.

1573
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,042
You are blabbering in sleep,

1574
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:01,500
Are you mad on movies?

1575
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:04,500
She was mad on movies.

1576
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,000
I'm mad on cricket.

1577
01:04:06,667 --> 01:04:06,792
Hmm,

1578
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:07,667
What?

1579
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:08,458
You confuse me!

1580
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:12,000
Her name is Radha!

1581
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:14,250
She looks beautiful
like a parrot!

1582
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,042
I'm like a tiger!

1583
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,667
Everyone prayed and given offerings to god,
wishing…India must win the match.

1584
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:27,333
But I,

1585
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:29,625
stepped ahead.

1586
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,875
Hello...

1587
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,708
On the commencement of
"World Cup,"

1588
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:38,333
On behalf of
"Dhoni Fan Club,"

1589
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,708
Dhoni fans were offering
milk pots...

1590
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:45,292
Fans club head
"Dhoni kumar,"

1591
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:47,458
is coming to offer milk pot!

1592
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:49,708
He is coming as a storm!

1593
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,458
Dhoni is coming to take milk pot.

1594
01:05:03,917 --> 01:05:05,458
Our captain
"Dhoni kumar"has come.

1595
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:06,500
Throw the ball.

1596
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:00,333
"Bless Dhoni..."

1597
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:02,125
"Bless Kohli..."

1598
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,417
"Bless Ashwin..."

1599
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,167
"Bless Dhoni..."

1600
01:06:05,167 --> 01:06:06,583
"Bless Ashwin..."

1601
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:07,958
Six is meant for dhoni.

1602
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:09,417
Dhoni is meant for history.

1603
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,167
"To Tamilan..."
-"It's Bull fight..."

1604
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,625
To Dhoni..."
"It's Cricket..."

1605
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,125
"To Tamilan..."
-"It's Bull fight..."

1606
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,708
To Dhoni..."
"It's Cricket..."

1607
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:18,917
Crackers is for bursting,
Dhoni is for Sixer

1608
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:21,792
Crackers is for bursting,
Dhoni is for Sixer

1609
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,125
SIvakasi is for....

1610
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:24,083
What's your problem?

1611
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,333
You carry on milk pots.

1612
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,500
Pot is here.

1613
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:29,000
Is there milk inside?

1614
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,917
Here it is.

1615
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,917
It went wrong.

1616
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,875
Is it milk?

1617
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:33,292
Then?

1618
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:33,750
Hey,

1619
01:06:34,292 --> 01:06:34,500
Come aside.

1620
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:36,708
Why do you get tensed?

1621
01:06:36,917 --> 01:06:38,042
I thought of asking
whether it's buttermilk?

1622
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:39,417
Don't take it out.

1623
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:40,708
Someone may be out.

1624
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:43,208
You're not good enough
to talk with humans.

1625
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,292
Hey wolf face,

1626
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,667
Go aside.
-Come .

01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:15,833

01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,708
"Om shivya namaha,"

1642
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:19,667

01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,917
Vindhya will win.

1644
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:21,375
Hmm,

1645
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:24,417
Are you a priest?

1646
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:26,792
Are you a priest?

1647
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:27,208
Hey...hey...

1648
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,250

Hurry up.

1654
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:37,792
The match may get over.

1655
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:38,500
Who is that?

1656
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,000
Stop it.

1657
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:41,500
Why do you hurry?

1658
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:42,708
Just wait.

1659
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:43,500
Hey,it's "Live match."

1660
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,458
Can't wait for you.

1661
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:47,083
A VIP is yet to arrive.

1662
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:49,167
Who is the VIP more than me?

1663
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:51,042
That's known only when taken.

1664
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,292
He tells VSOP as VIP.

1665
01:07:53,583 --> 01:07:54,125
Shut your mouth.

1666
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:54,833
Leave it.

1667
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:55,417
Let's watch the match.

1668
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:05,792
Superb!

1669
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:06,875
Look at there!

1670
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:11,833
Dude,only advertisements are going on,
when you'll show the movie?

1671
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:12,708
Hey oldster,sit down.

1672
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:13,000
Yes.

1673
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,417
He plays holding his breath!

1674
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:15,458
Tell her.

1675
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,875
I would've seen "big boss" programme.
-That's not her fault.

1676
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,167
They do commercials
more than playing cricket.

1677
01:08:19,167 --> 01:08:21,208
Granny,don't stand.

1678
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,708
Don't know what happened in programme?

1679
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,667
Hey superb!

1680
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:33,500
Everyone is there except me.

1681
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,000
Did you listen?

1682
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:43,833
Who is that?

1683
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:48,500
Who catch the ball hit by captain?

1684
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:52,667
Are you dare enough to brawl?

1685
01:08:52,667 --> 01:08:55,042
Why don't he revert me?

1686
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:56,417
He can't hear you.

1687
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:58,958
I'm an important person here.

1688
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:02,667
I left my works and came
to watch the game.

1689
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:04,250
How can he simply send him out.

1690
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:08,833
I'll bite him.

1691
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:10,042
Tell him to come now.

1692
01:09:10,042 --> 01:09:12,750
Bro,what if Kohli goes?

1693
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,958
Dhoni comes next.

1694
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:15,167
Dude,he feels more.

1695
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:16,417
He'll cool by taking beer.

1696
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:16,833
Drink it.

1697
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:18,500
Give it bro.

1698
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,750
All the shops are closed.
That's all for you.

1699
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:27,583
I'll slay you, if you do
any extra performances.

1700
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:28,583
Hit you on mouth.

1701
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,292
It's a sixer!

1702
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:37,500
Leave me,

1703
01:09:38,292 --> 01:09:39,000
It's enough...

1704
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:43,292
I feel shy.
-What's that sounds like a pig?

1705
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:44,500
It's not the sound of the pig.

1706
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,667
See that corner.

1707
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:48,958
Where are they going?

1708
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:51,917
Who switched on the light?

1709
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,292
Hey,what happens here?

1710
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:54,083
A match is going on.

1711
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:55,625
Match is going on there.

1712
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:57,042
Here too...

1713
01:09:58,083 --> 01:10:00,083
Who is playing match with
whom?

1714
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:01,958
You enjoyed and asking now?

1715
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,750
Get lost.

1716
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:06,125
I'm in search of my husband.

1717
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,208
But you dare to touch me.

1718
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:09,833
No respect for you...

1719
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:10,917
Be calm.

1720
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:13,417
You co operate when no
one notices,

1721
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,500
But transform as dragon
when someone notice.

1722
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,625
I know you...

1723
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:17,458
Dude,

1724
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:18,500
What do you talk there?

1725
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:19,500
It's the "Last ball,"

1726
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:20,917
Must hit "six" to win!

1727
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:11,500
A song from the movie "Raja China Roja"

1728
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:33,833
A song from the movie "Uzhaipali"

1729
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:48,208
A song from the movie "Baasha"

1730
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,167
An announcement to the public.

1731
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:04,458
On the eve of
"Superstar's birthday,"

1732
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:06,458
A warm welcome to you all.

1733
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:08,500
The astonishing event by your,

1734
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:15,042
Our dear friend,
"Rajini Fans Club," head

1735
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:18,375
Rajini Radha's performance...

1736
01:12:52,125 --> 01:13:04,500
A song from the movie "Annamalai"

1737
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,250
Hey,

1738
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,750
I'm Baasha and
you are Antony,

1739
01:13:31,292 --> 01:13:32,417
The brawl is between us.

1740
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:35,208
Either you must be here or me.

1741
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:36,125
Dude,

1742
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:37,708
What's the fuss
between you both?

1743
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:41,417
She remembers the past
and points at it now.

1744
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:42,333
Oh...

1745
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:43,042
Shall we hit her?

1746
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:45,500
What's the discussion?

1747
01:13:45,833 --> 01:13:46,750
Check the additions and omissions.

1748
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:48,333
The result will be wrong.

1749
01:13:48,708 --> 01:13:49,000
Dude,

1750
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,917
Do the police arrest me too?

1751
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:51,292
Pssh.

1752
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:53,583
My dear people,

1753
01:13:54,792 --> 01:13:56,500
On the eve of
my leader's birthday,

1754
01:13:57,417 --> 01:14:02,292
The golden heart people of tamilnadu,

1755
01:14:02,458 --> 01:14:07,458
I wish you all to extend your
support to the fans club.

1756
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:10,000
It's past a couple of months,
on touching the cricket bat.

1757
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,583
Today we are playing.
-Yes.

1758
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:13,625
Hey,it seems you started,
"big boss" shots.

1759
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,125
Who is going to be
the opening batsman?

1760
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,417
I'll play...I'll play...

1761
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,958
Already you have done.

1762
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:18,792
Go away.

1763
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:20,250
Dude,i'll play.

1764
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:21,000
Okay,

1765
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,000
Go and wear the gloves.

1766
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:22,417
Okay.

1767
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,083
Keeping gloves.

1768
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:24,750
What?

1769
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:27,125
It's okay.

1770
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:27,792
Dude,

1771
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:28,750
please...

1772
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:29,875
Just once!

1773
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:30,958
What?

1774
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:32,583
At least I'll touch the bat.

1775
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:33,167
Okay,take it.

1776
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:34,917
You touched,right?

1777
01:14:35,042 --> 01:14:35,208
Give me back.

1778
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:37,042
Why?

1779
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:39,000
You can play next.
Go...At this old age...

1780
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:39,625
Be an umpire...

1781
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:40,833
You all...

1782
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:41,792
We know.

1783
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,042
We'll go for fielding.

1784
01:14:45,042 --> 01:14:47,167
They say okay in chorus!

1785
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:50,000
Somehow i managed them
to send for fielding.

1786
01:14:50,417 --> 01:14:51,083
Am i the first?

1787
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:51,583
Yes,

1788
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:52,250
You are the first.

1789
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:52,792
Bowling!

1790
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,375
For past two months,
i'm the bowler.

1791
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,167
You'll come up as
good bowler.

1792
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:57,417
Go...

1793
01:14:58,208 --> 01:14:59,500
What are you doing here?

1794
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:00,458
Standing to catch the ball.

1795
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:02,208
Is it the way to catch?

1796
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:03,417
You can catch the ball
this way too.

1797
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:04,375
You'll catch by mouth also.

1798
01:15:09,875 --> 01:15:11,417
Won't he throw the ball?

1799
01:15:11,667 --> 01:15:11,917
Hmm...

1800
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,083
Bowling...

1801
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:15,833
Hmm...

1802
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:16,792
What?

1803
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:17,833
He is yet to get ready.

1804
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:20,583
Ready... Ready...

1805
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:21,458
Bowling...

1806
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:25,625
Hmm...

1807
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,458
What happened now?
-I'm not ready.

1808
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:28,625
Why must you get ready?

1809
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:29,333
Shut up.

1810
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:31,458
THE

1811
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:34,292
Ready...Ready...

1812
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:35,375
Throw the ball in line.

1813
01:15:38,417 --> 01:15:38,708
Hmm,

1814
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:40,250
No...

1815
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,042
No sound at all.

1816
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:46,458
Did the ball reach the space?

1817
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,167
What are you looking at?

1818
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,333
I'm yet to throw the ball.

1819
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,042
You are yet to throw
the ball!

1820
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:50,208
I was practising.

1821
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:50,750
Throw now.

1822
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:52,500
Ready...

1823
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,292
Do you want to remove
the vest?

1824
01:15:57,583 --> 01:15:58,250
Come on...Come on...

1825
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:08,000
Do you think of as
"Titanic," hero?

1826
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:09,333
Are you taking avenge,
as i didn't let you to bat?

1827
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:10,167
You come here.

1828
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:10,833
You be the umpire.

1829
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,708
Hurry up.
Throw the ball.

1830
01:16:14,667 --> 01:16:15,667
Don't lift your hands.

1831
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:16,250
Fold your hands.

1832
01:16:17,292 --> 01:16:17,917
No,put the hands in pocket.

1833
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:19,333
Yes.

1834
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:27,333
Are you playing with stones?

1835
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:27,875
Lift the ball.

1836
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:28,417
Hey,

1837
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:29,417
I'm the captain.

1838
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,375
Are you teaching me?

1839
01:16:30,417 --> 01:16:32,292
Will you hit up,
even if i teach?

1840
01:16:33,292 --> 01:16:35,708
Tough to learn
by playing with them.

1841
01:16:36,667 --> 01:16:37,917
Throw the ball.

1842
01:16:38,167 --> 01:16:39,833
Will he hit his ball?

1843
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:41,042
Think over it.

1844
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:42,000
The match will end.

1845
01:16:51,292 --> 01:16:51,500
Hey,

1846
01:16:51,792 --> 01:16:53,500
You lifted the ball
and hit the glass.

1847
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:56,167
You don't lift the ball,
Good to play flat.

1848
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:56,583
That's it.

1849
01:16:56,917 --> 01:16:57,458
Shut your mouth.

1850
01:16:59,042 --> 01:17:00,375
Wonder what is he going
to break now!

1851
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:02,875
After getting rid of all doshas...

1852
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:07,458
we must enjoy our first night.

1853
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:09,750
...I pray the goddess that

1854
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:10,500
Hey sweety,

1855
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:13,667
Such a large
dream belt in your heart!

1856
01:17:13,667 --> 01:17:14,167
Yes.

1857
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:15,208
I can't believe you.

1858
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:20,500
A song from the movie "Umai vizhigal"

1859
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:27,333
No...
My drumsticks become waste.

1860
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,500
Does it burst?

1861
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:33,208
With five rupees ball,
my life was punctured.

1862
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,083
Hey...

1863
01:17:35,667 --> 01:17:38,292
Either you hit high or down.

1864
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:40,000
It's over.

1865
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,333
They'll call for Panchayat.

1866
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:42,917
Are you afraid of it?

1867
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:44,167
Not that.

1868
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,667
I'm afraid of the person
who roams around as head.

1869
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:55,250
Don't lift your dhoti.

1870
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,417
Others may know it.

1871
01:17:56,417 --> 01:17:57,042
It's known to all.
Then what?

1872
01:17:59,375 --> 01:17:59,833
Stop it.

1873
01:18:01,125 --> 01:18:02,375
Why do you all create noise?

1874
01:18:05,292 --> 01:18:06,333
Did he hit him wantedly?

1875
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:08,333
Yes.
-Who is that?

1876
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:10,708
Just for breaking a
ten rupees bulb,

1877
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:12,833
You need a judgement.

1878
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,750
Be quiet.

1879
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:16,792
Who broke it?

1880
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,333
Aren't they our people?

1881
01:18:19,792 --> 01:18:20,333
So

1882
01:18:20,917 --> 01:18:21,583
We'll forgive and leave them.

1883
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,500
Yes...

1884
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,667
We can't leave that so easily.

1885
01:18:30,333 --> 01:18:31,750
It can be an ordinary,

1886
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:33,750
But that's more powerful!

1887
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:35,583
Both the damages
must be set right.

1888
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,375
It's the decision of
"Rajini Fans Club."

1889
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:43,417
I must decide it as the head.

1890
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:44,417
Tell then.

1891
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:46,417
If i say,

1892
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:48,500
then it's the saying of god!

1893
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:53,708
My way is different!

1894
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:56,292
Head,

1895
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:57,792
why do you fold hands
as a school goer?

1896
01:18:58,292 --> 01:18:59,625
Did you recall your teacher?

1897
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:01,792
Then you must remember
the song.

1898
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:03,333
What's that about the teacher?
What's the song?

1899
01:19:03,917 --> 01:19:06,417
So you don't remember
the teacher and the song.

1900
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:07,292
What you blabber?

1901
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:08,292
Play that song.

1902
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:08,792
Hmm,

1903
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:20,500
A Song from the movie "Nattamai"

1904
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,250
Stop it.

1905
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,167
Now i'll tell the judgement.

1906
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,875
Those who broke the bulb must
pay penalty to the Panchayat.

1907
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:29,500
It's my judgement.

1908
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:36,792
What's this?

1909
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:50,792
Did you still think of as crying
when you pinch my waist?

1910
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:54,583
Now I'm "Radha,"
"Rajini Radha..."

1911
01:19:55,792 --> 01:20:00,875
A song from the movie "Kabali"

1912
01:20:03,292 --> 01:20:04,833
If you wish,
only the crackers fire.

1913
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,208
If i wish,the entire sivakasi
will be on crackers.

1914
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:07,833
This day,this time...

1915
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,042
Mark it in your mind.

1916
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,167
Today i'm just a drop.

1917
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:11,500
Tomorrow i'll become a
high wave.

1918
01:20:11,833 --> 01:20:12,083
Oh...

1919
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:12,583
On that day,

1920
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:16,583
I'll burst the bulb in your house,
and pay the penalty.

1921
01:20:17,042 --> 01:20:18,042
Or else we'll dissolve our
Fans Club.

1922
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:21,375
You do that first and foremost.

1923
01:20:22,458 --> 01:20:23,083
Sall i leave.

1924
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:23,625
Hey,

1925
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:25,500
I'm talking to her fiercely,

1926
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:26,500
you made it as a fun.

1927
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:27,375
Leave it.

1928
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,250
When did you pinch her waist?

1929
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:29,292
It's very important.

1930
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:30,000
Yes,that's important to me.

1931
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:30,792
Tell me and go.

1932
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:33,667
On eve of the Ayyanar carnival,

1933
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:38,333
We announce on behalf of
"Dhoni Fans Club,"

1934
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:43,458

one day cricket match

1935
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:56,625
So we invite you all
to support us.

1936
01:20:57,292 --> 01:20:59,417
Hey,why do you talk
as if contesting the election?

1937
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,792
No one will come
if you address them this way.

1938
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:01,333
I'll talk,

1939
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,125
Yawning Kohli,

1940
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:05,625
Sweet eating Raina,

Gate opening,Kedar jadav.

1942
01:21:07,417 --> 01:21:08,625
Tamilan is to Bull fight,

1943
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:09,917
Dhoni is to cricket.

1944
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:12,333
Applaud!

1945
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:15,292
If you come to watch our crickrt match...

1946
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:17,250
...will give you pizza.

1947
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:18,792
We don't want PETA,

1948
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:20,792
You are in update of current affairs,
Are you in "WhatsApp?"

1949
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,000
No,i'm in plaintain groove.

1950
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:23,750
Okay,thats it.

1951
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:24,417
You no need to come.

1952
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:26,917
If you come to the match,

1953
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:31,042
You'll get pizza and green tea.

1954
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:31,500
Hey,

1955
01:21:32,042 --> 01:21:33,625
You tell something on
your own.

1956
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,625
Then only the crowd arrives.

1957
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:36,208
Is it?
-Yes.

1958
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:38,250
Then say juice and beer too.

1959
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:39,000
What about money for that?

1960
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:41,417
Here it is!

1961
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:42,042
Hold it.

1962
01:21:43,167 --> 01:21:44,250
Granny take it.

1963
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:47,250
Hey,

1964
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,208
why did you give her?

1965
01:21:49,792 --> 01:21:50,458
She is my granny.

1966
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,125
if it's with you it'll go
to the pawn shop

1967
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:53,375
Its safe with her.

1968
01:21:53,417 --> 01:21:54,000
You are fraud.

1969
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:54,958
You proceed.

1970
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:58,000
Did you watch Dhoni's brother?

1971
01:21:58,333 --> 01:21:59,583
We give gold chains
for not coming.

1972
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:00,875
Imagine what we'll give still?

1973
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:02,625
Little boys,

We'll give you ice creams
and chocolates.

1975

We'll ask schools

1976
01:22:07,458 --> 01:22:08,250
What are you looking at?

1977
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:09,375
How is our status?

1978
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:11,125
We are rocking!

1979
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:12,750
Hey...

1980
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:14,167
Just a minute.

1981
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:15,333
Look here.

1982
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:20,458
A song from the movie"Murattu kaalai"

1983
01:22:45,292 --> 01:22:46,458
My dear people,

01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:48,792

Hey,younger women in

1989
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:06,625
Shall we cancel the match?

1990
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:07,917
Are you a player?

1991
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:08,792
Is it merely a match?

1992
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:09,500
Our soul!

1993
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:10,792
Oops...

Where are you going?

2000
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:35,875
All were young ladies,

2001
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,458
They frankly said,
it'll be entertaining and glamourous.

2002
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:39,167
We'll go there.

2003
01:23:39,292 --> 01:23:39,875
Are you a player?

2004
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:41,917

Get me too.

2012
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:01,000

2013
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:03,792
Shall i stay as a virgin ever?

2014
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,417
Hey, give me the bat.

2015
01:24:08,542 --> 01:24:09,208
Will you go if they call?

2016
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:10,875

2017
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,250

On behalf of "Rajini Fans club,"

2019
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:24,000
The "Kabbadi" game

2020
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,375
Now...

2021
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:31,042
Most anticipating,

2022
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:35,333
Rajini Radha has come.

2023
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:39,583
Along with her in the team is,

Bhavana...

2025
01:24:41,792 --> 01:24:46,042
Muthalagi and Chandra.

2026
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,292
Everyone is ready to play.

2027
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:54,333
Rajini Radha is coming
to play

2028
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:56,667
opposite to Antony team.

2029
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Let's wait and watch
the thunder storm!

2030
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:11,708
Two points!

2031
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,375
The players in the ground.

2032
01:25:14,917 --> 01:25:18,333
Public are requested
not to disturb

2033
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:21,458
Who is that boy standing
on the rope?

2034
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:22,792
You'll fall down.

2035
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:29,458
Not even a bird or a
fly here!

2036
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:30,292
Dude,

2037
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,292
I saw two crows and a fly here.

2038
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,875
It's good to curb your tongue.

2039
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:36,875
I'm in frustration.

2040
01:25:39,417 --> 01:25:41,125
Now the player is treasurer
of the club,

2041
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:44,292
Muthalagu...

2042
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:50,000
Hey yellow clad,

2043
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:53,458
don't stare at them
with eagle eyes.

2044
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:54,125
Go away.

2045
01:25:56,542 --> 01:25:58,125
An announcement to the police.

2046
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:01,958
As the public is going
out of control...

2047
01:26:02,792 --> 01:26:04,917
Kabbadi sounds so good.

2048
01:26:07,792 --> 01:26:11,167
Watch the thunder storm here!

2049
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:15,000
Rajini Radha leads
with more points!

2050
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:17,625
A pair of eyes is
not enough to see!

2051
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,625
Hey six!

2052
01:26:19,792 --> 01:26:21,500
He hit six!

2053
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:25,292
Take the ball out from
the crowd.

2054
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:27,792
Sixes!

2055
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:30,000
What happened?
-It's a six!

2056
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:31,083
Shall we go to hospital?

2057
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:33,750
Do you want to be ashamed?

2058
01:26:34,042 --> 01:26:34,917
See how they show off?

2059
01:26:35,167 --> 01:26:36,625
No other go for us.

2060
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:39,458
A huge crowd has come.

2061
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:41,792
All youngsters and students!

2062
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:43,667
Are they all heads or not?

2063
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:44,542
Not...

2064
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:45,333
Yes, Not...

2065
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:46,250
Are you teasing?

2066
01:26:46,417 --> 01:26:47,375
You try it.

2067
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:54,000
"Wadi Warriors team,"is batting.

2068
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:56,208
Bowling of first ball ...

2069
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,458
The first ball is hit as
helicopter shot.

2070
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,917
That ball really hit
the helicopter!

2071
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:02,083
It's over reaction!

2072
01:27:02,292 --> 01:27:03,792
It's the second ball!

2073
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:05,167
Got out.

2074
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:12,917
Both the teams are
getting ready for finals!

2075
01:27:13,208 --> 01:27:14,708
To watch Radha's performance...

2076
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:16,875
Just five minutes to go...

2077
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:17,167
Hey,

2078
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:18,083
Who is that taking

2079
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:20,083
Selfie in low angle!

2080
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:22,750
They take low angle selfie too?

2081
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,708
We aren't gifted.

2082
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:27,917
Hey,

2083
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:29,083
What's the discussion?

2084
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:30,583
It's the finals,
increase the pitch.

2085
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:32,875
What happened?

2086
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:34,375
Pain in my kidney.

2087
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:35,625
It's down.

2088
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:36,875
Captain,

2089
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,750
I can't bear the pain.

2090
01:27:38,917 --> 01:27:39,208
Hey...

2091
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:40,542
Captain,save me.

2092
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:41,542
I'll mock you.

2093
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:42,958
Shall i save him?

2094
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,042
No one will save me,

2095
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:47,917
i'll take care on my own.

2096
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:48,792
Go...

2097
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:49,958
He came for no reason.

2098
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,000
What a shot!

2099
01:27:51,542 --> 01:27:52,542
Oh...out!

2100
01:27:52,875 --> 01:27:54,000
The last wicket is lost...

2101
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:54,667
Let it go.

2102
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,167
Hey,

2103
01:27:55,417 --> 01:27:55,750
What?

2104
01:27:56,167 --> 01:27:56,958
Did granny expired?

2105
01:27:57,292 --> 01:27:59,042
Do i must come?

2106
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:00,958
My granny!
-Hey

2107
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:01,917
You are an old man,

2108
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:02,875
You have a granny still?

2109
01:28:03,125 --> 01:28:04,417
Don't tell lies.
-No dude

2110
01:28:04,417 --> 01:28:06,000
She is my only granny.

2111
01:28:06,083 --> 01:28:06,458
Hey,

2112
01:28:06,667 --> 01:28:08,375
She'll buy me a full drink.

2113
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:09,583
Don't cheat.

2114
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:12,125
No,i'm leaving.
-No...

2115
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:13,625
Hey....Hey....

2116
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:15,167
Finish the match and go.

2117
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:18,667
Hello,

2118
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:20,875
Is it tsunami in Kallakurichi?

2119
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:23,667
Does water flows more than 30ft?

2120
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,042
Unbelievable!

2121
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,583
I too can't believe.
He didn't believe.

2122
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:28,917
I'll get you the video.

2123
01:28:29,125 --> 01:28:29,542
Just two minutes.

2124
01:28:29,792 --> 01:28:31,125
Hey...

2125
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:33,125
If you are a habitual drunkard, come out.

2126
01:28:33,417 --> 01:28:35,667
Yes,i'm a drunkard

2127
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:36,167
Hey...

2128
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:39,625
Shit.

2129
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:25,708
Antony team is scattered by
Baasha team!

2130
01:29:25,792 --> 01:29:27,125
I'm not a Komban(Wild elephant),
I'm Kumki(Tamed elephant).

2131
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:30,667
Come on,we'll watch Cricket.

2132
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,875
Are you here to watch Kabbadi?
Call them all...

2133
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:33,958
Come on...

2134
01:29:45,792 --> 01:29:48,417
As our captain thinks, we didn't
come to see your match...

2135
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,542
But to see your actions.

2136
01:29:50,042 --> 01:29:51,292
If you come to watch our match,

2137
01:29:51,292 --> 01:29:54,708
we'll give food and drinks.

2138
01:29:55,292 --> 01:29:56,542
Enough of it.

2139
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:58,292
Enough of your scenes.

2140
01:29:58,792 --> 01:29:59,792
Just watch now.

2141
01:29:59,917 --> 01:30:04,792
To distribute the prizes for
the winners.

2142
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:07,250
We invite our "Village head,"

2143
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:26,208
A song from the movie"Nattamai"

2144
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:52,042
To appreciate the valorous women...
-Hey,get down.

2145
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:53,167
Are you going to proceed?

2146
01:30:53,167 --> 01:30:54,292
You go to "Big boss show"
-Okay.

2147
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,708
Why do they interrupt
in our way?

2148
01:30:57,042 --> 01:30:58,208
Something they have planned.

2149
01:30:58,208 --> 01:30:59,042
All-rounder Aadhi...

2150
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:00,792
When the victorious girls
are waiting here,

2151
01:31:01,417 --> 01:31:03,042
The Village head is
romancing there,

2152
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,083
What's your opinion about it?

2153
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:05,667
Mr.Dhoni kumar,

2154
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:07,583
It may be glamorous
to him right now.

2155
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:13,042
But today it'll be viral in
Whats app.

2156
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:13,625
Then he'll feel the heat.

2157
01:31:13,917 --> 01:31:15,333
Hey,wait...

2158
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:18,208
What's your problem?

2159
01:31:19,167 --> 01:31:20,667
You create fuss on me.

2160
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,750
He threatens that
he'll send in WhatsApp.

2161
01:31:23,417 --> 01:31:26,333
Are you breaking my spinal cord
for giving penalty?

2162
01:31:26,667 --> 01:31:28,542
Are you romancing in chariot?
-Shut up.

2163
01:31:28,792 --> 01:31:29,792
What's your problem now?

2164
01:31:31,042 --> 01:31:31,792
Why didn't you come
for our match?

2165
01:31:31,792 --> 01:31:33,125
You mean playing with
the bat and ball?

2166
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:33,750
What?

2167
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:34,917
Not that hold!

2168
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:36,500
They catch me here.

2169
01:31:36,667 --> 01:31:37,958
We too saw the catch
in chariot.

2170
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:39,125
I meant hand.

2171
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:41,542
What to do now?

2172
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:45,083
You want me to give the
victory cup to you,isn't it?

2173
01:31:47,958 --> 01:31:49,042
I do just for your sake.

2174
01:31:49,125 --> 01:31:52,083
As the head of the Village,

2175
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:58,958
I wish that he'll give
the Cup,

2176
01:31:59,208 --> 01:32:02,708
As he does good deeds.

2177
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:04,042
He hits all sixes!

2178
01:32:04,042 --> 01:32:04,708
Do you eat mix of food?

2179
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:05,958
What rhyming is it?

2180
01:32:06,042 --> 01:32:07,500
It's good to break his
friendship.

2181
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:08,708
Listen to him.

2182
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:10,208
Talk now.

2183
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:16,792
As i have an imortant work...

2184
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:22,458
So he'll give the
victory cup.

2185
01:32:22,875 --> 01:32:23,458
Head...

2186
01:32:23,792 --> 01:32:24,917
It's the decision of the
Village head.

2187
01:32:25,083 --> 01:32:26,167
I've many important works.

2188
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:26,583
I'm leaving.

2189
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:27,625
Thank you.

2190
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:30,083
Head...

2191
01:32:31,583 --> 01:32:32,667
Are you playing
glamorous game?

2192
01:32:33,542 --> 01:32:34,667
Respected people,

2193
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:36,542
What's life about?

2194
01:32:36,917 --> 01:32:38,125
If you get up in the morning,
You have coffee.

2195
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:39,292
If not,
you'll be poured milk.

2196
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:40,958
If you attend the phone call,
It's incoming call.

2197
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:41,792
If failed,
It's the missed call.

2198
01:32:42,042 --> 01:32:42,375
Wait.

2199
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:46,208
We can have competition in life,
But life shouldn't be in competition.

2200
01:32:47,875 --> 01:32:49,417
On behalf of
"Dhoni Fans Club,"

2201
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:51,125
And respecting Village head...

2202
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:52,708
...we give the prize,

2203
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:53,583
Come and get it.

2204
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:01,333
Welcome Radha
who gets the cup!

2205
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:01,750
Sorry.

2206
01:33:02,250 --> 01:33:02,750
Few words about me...

2207
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:07,583
Our captain Dhoni, With
big heart, gives this small cup.

2208
01:33:07,667 --> 01:33:08,750
Congratulate him.

2209
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:09,708
Applaud well .

2210
01:33:11,542 --> 01:33:12,542
Yes,clap.

2211
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:13,583
What's that?

2212
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:27,875
"Lord Ayyanar is coming!
Lord Ayyanar is coming!"

2213
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:31,333
"Lord Ayyanar comes as procession
to guard the village!"

2214
01:33:34,417 --> 01:33:37,625
"Slashing the rope he comes
with the sound of anklets!"

2215
01:33:37,917 --> 01:33:42,500
"He comes fiercely encompassing
Lord Muni!"

2216
01:33:44,292 --> 01:33:47,458
"Lord Ayyanar is coming!
Lord Ayyanar is coming!"

2217
01:33:47,792 --> 01:33:52,667
"He comes courageously holding
the billhook lute!"

2218
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:58,000
"Lord Sadamuni!

2219
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:02,458
"Lord Pandimuni!"

2220
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:05,708
Hey......

2221
01:34:15,667 --> 01:34:16,083
Priest,

2222
01:34:16,542 --> 01:34:17,917
Bathe well the lord ayyanar.

2223
01:34:18,083 --> 01:34:19,917
I'll do face wash also.

2224
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:21,625
You may do pedicure
and manicure also.

2225
01:34:21,792 --> 01:34:22,875
Don't want.
Do what we say.

2226
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,500
Since your childhood,

2227
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:26,917
We are washing
Ayyanar statue.

2228
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:28,792
You don't try to teach us.

2229
01:34:28,917 --> 01:34:30,208
Look out your work.

2230
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:31,542
Do you all know
at least now,

2231
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:33,583
where the chains of
ayyanar has gone?

2232
01:34:33,583 --> 01:34:34,792
We have seen.

2233
01:34:35,292 --> 01:34:37,458
Don't barge me in
unwanted stuff.

2234
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:38,625
Leave me.

2235
01:34:38,792 --> 01:34:39,708
I'll follow what you say.

2236
01:34:39,708 --> 01:34:40,792
You don't leave the statue.

2237
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:41,500
Bro,

2238
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:43,292
We belong to valour family.

2239
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:46,375
We hold strongly.

2240
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,417
He holds something.
What's that?

2241
01:34:50,917 --> 01:34:52,208
On behalf of "Dhoni Fan Club,"

2242
01:34:52,917 --> 01:34:54,125
It's the ritual to lord.

2243
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:56,500
Is it a bat and ball?

2244
01:34:58,917 --> 01:34:59,208
Priest,

2245
01:34:59,500 --> 01:34:59,917
Take the soap.

2246
01:35:00,042 --> 01:35:01,042
Soap to ayyanar?

2247
01:35:01,292 --> 01:35:02,583
It's for you.

2248
01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:03,417
Can't tolerate the odour.

2249
01:35:03,667 --> 01:35:05,542
You are going to be
prey for lord's anger.

2250
01:35:05,792 --> 01:35:06,000
Hey,

2251
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:07,917
They talk limitless.

2252
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:08,792
We'll show them our strength.

2253
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:10,875
Priest,

2254
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:12,958
Still how long you
bathe him at corner?

2255
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:14,917
Bathe him well keeping at
the centre.

2256
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:16,792
Yes,water is good in
the mid.

2257
01:35:16,792 --> 01:35:18,250
Does mineral water flows in
the mid?

2258
01:35:20,667 --> 01:35:22,250
Generations together we bathe him here.

2259
01:35:22,542 --> 01:35:24,375
You are immature.
You be calm.

2260
01:35:24,792 --> 01:35:25,750
If I say...

2261
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:27,542
She said..

2262
01:35:28,042 --> 01:35:28,708
Then what?

2263
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:30,667
Get him to middle.

2264
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:33,000
I don't know swimming sir.

2265
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:34,125
That's what i hesitate.

2266
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,167
Lord knows,

2267
01:35:36,417 --> 01:35:38,458
It's the decision of the head.

2268
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:39,667
Lift him to the middle.

2269
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:41,875
No queries to your words.

2270
01:35:41,958 --> 01:35:42,583
Lift him.

2271
01:36:02,708 --> 01:36:03,625
Lord Ayyanar...,

2272
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:07,000
Bless the entire village
to be auspicious.

2273
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:13,167
Pray well.

2274
01:36:13,958 --> 01:36:15,917
Let the rains
Fluorish the lands.

2275
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:17,708
Immerse him well.

2276
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:22,167
Lord Ayyanar...

2277
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:24,625
Lord Ayyanar...

2278
01:36:27,042 --> 01:36:27,750
Lord Ayyanar...

2279
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:33,750
Hey snake...snake...

2280
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:36,000
Snake on my leg...

2281
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:38,292
Head,

2282
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:39,250
What?

2283
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:41,167
Ayyanar is missing.

2284
01:36:41,542 --> 01:36:42,125
What?

2285
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,208
Who is that playing
the rhythm wrong?

2286
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:45,292
Who is that escaping?.

2287
01:36:45,542 --> 01:36:47,375
Who is that escaping?.
I'm not escaping.

2288
01:36:47,583 --> 01:36:47,792
Hey,

2289
01:36:48,292 --> 01:36:49,708
Instead of doing abishekam
with milk,

2290
01:36:49,708 --> 01:36:51,125
You immersed him on the whole.

2291
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:52,375
I told you.

2292
01:36:52,917 --> 01:36:54,000
No one listens to me.

2293
01:36:54,125 --> 01:36:55,042
Even the captain.

2294
01:36:55,042 --> 01:36:55,333
Hey,

2295
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,750
Why do you stare at me?
It's not seen.

2296
01:36:58,333 --> 01:36:59,750
Why are you silent?

2297
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:00,875
I'll talk now.

2298
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:02,750
Ayyanar saves our village.

2299
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:03,917
Now we need to save him.

2300
01:37:04,167 --> 01:37:05,083
All of you search for
him in the river.

2301
01:37:29,792 --> 01:37:31,250
Not able to find.

2302
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:32,542
Still go deep to search.

2303
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:38,042
Still How i rescued you?

2304
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,042
Are you the reason
for my pregnancy?

2305
01:37:41,667 --> 01:37:42,250
Hey no...

2306
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,417
Shall i help her?

2307
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:45,000
You go and search that side.

2308
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:47,000
Go on...

2309
01:37:55,792 --> 01:37:58,125
Go and search.

2310
01:37:59,917 --> 01:38:00,125
Sir,

2311
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,167
Sir,

2312
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:02,292
what do you do?

2313
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:05,625
We can lift the statue,
when water gets drained.

2314
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:07,292
My shirt won't get wet.

2315
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:09,042
So you don't want
your shirt to get wet?

2316
01:38:09,292 --> 01:38:09,708
Look at there...

2317
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:11,333
No...

2318
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:19,292
Aiyyanar is not here.

2319
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:23,375
Oh Lord!

2320
01:38:39,708 --> 01:38:40,625
Search well.

2321
01:38:40,625 --> 01:38:40,958
You be quite.

2322
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:42,958
Don't stand there.

2323
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:44,750
Come here.

2324
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:48,375
Thunders!
-Come to shore.

2325
01:38:51,917 --> 01:38:53,125
They are not listening.

2326
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:54,958
It's not there
come out.

2327
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:00,000
Come fast.

2328
01:39:00,917 --> 01:39:02,792
I won't come out

2329
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:10,042
It's raining heavily.
Storm swirls.

2330
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:10,792
Come on dude,

2331
01:39:11,542 --> 01:39:15,958
I won't come out
without the statue of Ayyanar.

2332
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,417
It's raining heavily.

2333
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:21,792
How long will you
stay in water?

2334
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:24,917
Not good for woman.
Come to the shore.

2335
01:39:25,083 --> 01:39:26,958
Hey,don't under estimate me.

2336
01:39:27,208 --> 01:39:29,250
I'm as strong as a male.

2337
01:39:29,583 --> 01:39:30,792
I roar as a lion
if it's a competition.

2338
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:32,417
It's a shame to quit midway.

2339
01:39:33,125 --> 01:39:34,958
I'll come to the shore
with Ayyanar.

2340
01:39:44,458 --> 01:39:45,417
They came with Ayyanar!

2341
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:47,958
Beat the drums!
Play the strings!

2342
01:39:49,292 --> 01:39:49,958
Lord!

2343
01:39:51,542 --> 01:39:52,458
Come on...Come on...

2344
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:02,875
Hey...

2345
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:04,958
Ayyanar guards the village.

2346
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,083
But you saved him.

2347
01:40:07,583 --> 01:40:08,917
For name sake
i may be the head.

2348
01:40:09,167 --> 01:40:10,292
But the fact is
you are the head!

2349
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,750
I'm telling right, I's it?

2350
01:40:14,292 --> 01:40:15,125
Lord Ayyanar!

2351
01:40:34,958 --> 01:40:36,583
Sister,give me
cassandra flowers.

2352
01:40:36,625 --> 01:40:39,000
Jasmine will suit your dress.

2353
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:40,667
Okay give.

2354
01:40:53,583 --> 01:40:54,958
It's time up for pooja.

2355
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:57,875
Priest,is this the time
to come?

2356
01:40:58,333 --> 01:40:59,917
You must've come to
next pooja.

2357
01:41:00,375 --> 01:41:01,083
What to do?

2358
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:02,625
My wife gets up late.
-Hmm...

2359
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:04,833
Wife's problem is more
important than god.

2360
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:05,750
What to do?

2361
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:08,083
She is the guard.

2362
01:41:08,292 --> 01:41:08,708
Open the door.

2363
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,333
Indignity to the god!

2364
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:15,917
Who are you?

2365
01:41:16,042 --> 01:41:17,583
What are you doing
inside the temple?

2366
01:41:18,167 --> 01:41:20,458
Did you jump the wall?

2367
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:22,000
Then for what I've the keys?

2368
01:41:22,292 --> 01:41:23,958
How dare you are!

2369
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:25,500
Shall i call the police?

2370
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:26,083
priest.

2371
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:27,250
Don't do that,

2372
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:28,958
We both love each other.

2373
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:30,250
We eloped from our village.

2374
01:41:30,542 --> 01:41:31,667
Our people came to lynch us.

2375
01:41:32,292 --> 01:41:33,667
That's why we came here.

2376
01:41:34,792 --> 01:41:35,083
Please...

2377
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:35,667
Priest.

2378
01:41:36,042 --> 01:41:37,042
Hey,get up.

2379
01:41:37,792 --> 01:41:39,250
Am i a priest or a broker?

2380
01:41:39,792 --> 01:41:40,458
Isn't it a temple?

2381
01:41:41,417 --> 01:41:41,708
Hey,

2382
01:41:42,375 --> 01:41:43,625
I'm not a brahmin.

2383
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,125
I'm a shark!
I'm a shark!

2384
01:41:45,417 --> 01:41:50,000
I'm a terror inside
the temple.

2385
01:41:50,042 --> 01:41:50,292
Hey stop it.

2386
01:41:51,542 --> 01:41:54,083
Did they steal the idols
or the money?

2387
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,083
No...the god...

2388
01:41:58,417 --> 01:41:58,958
Where are you from?

2389
01:42:16,458 --> 01:42:17,625
Neelakanda Shastri!

2390
01:42:18,042 --> 01:42:18,958
Is it right for you?

2391
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:19,500
Oh my god!

2392
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:22,083
You dare to call me by name!
Don't you've respect?

2393
01:42:22,333 --> 01:42:23,500
Lord! Don't you know?

2394
01:42:24,333 --> 01:42:25,250
He knows everything.

2395
01:42:25,917 --> 01:42:27,333
All your jitters.

2396
01:42:27,792 --> 01:42:29,542
She blames me.

2397
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,958
Is there anyone to ask it?

2398
01:42:32,042 --> 01:42:32,458
We are here.

2399
01:42:33,292 --> 01:42:34,167
That's why asking.

2400
01:42:35,167 --> 01:42:36,958
They both love each other.

2401
01:42:37,708 --> 01:42:39,375
Before others lynch them,

2402
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:41,625
you must conjoin them.

2403
01:42:42,083 --> 01:42:42,292
Yes,

2404
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:45,917
It's like raising a generation.

2405
01:42:47,083 --> 01:42:48,125
Before the auspicious time ends,

2406
01:42:48,583 --> 01:42:49,500
Good to do their marriage.

2407
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,125
Will you chant the mantras?

2408
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:55,250
Or shall I chant?

2409
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:56,458
I'll chant the mantras.

2410
01:42:56,708 --> 01:42:58,125
I'll chant the mantras.
My money will go off.

2411
01:42:59,083 --> 01:43:13,875
(Chanting Mantras)

2412
01:43:14,417 --> 01:43:15,042
Give to her.

2413
01:43:16,333 --> 01:43:17,083
Exchange the garlands.

2414
01:43:19,583 --> 01:43:20,333
Take the mangal sutra.

2415
01:43:22,042 --> 01:43:22,750
Give to him.

2416
01:43:25,792 --> 01:43:27,417
Tie the knot.
Tie it strongly.

2417
01:43:33,167 --> 01:43:33,958
Be good.

2418
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:34,792
Be good.

2419
01:43:36,542 --> 01:43:37,167
Come,let's go.

2420
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,167
Come,let's go.

2421
01:43:41,083 --> 01:43:41,250
Brother,

2422
01:43:41,542 --> 01:43:42,167
just a minute.

2423
01:43:44,417 --> 01:43:45,583
Hey,
-What's this?

2424
01:43:46,292 --> 01:43:48,125
You are good pair
in the garland.

2425
01:43:49,167 --> 01:43:49,583
You....

2426
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:50,625
Sorry.

2427
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:51,500
Just a selfie.

2428
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:52,250
Come here.

2429
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,667
We won't forget you ever.

2430
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:03,583
Be happy.

2431
01:44:03,708 --> 01:44:04,375
Thanks brother.
-Take care of her

2432
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:05,458
I'm leaving.

2433
01:44:11,167 --> 01:44:12,792
The bride groom belongs
to reputed family it seems.

2434
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:15,000
Stop it.

2435
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:18,625
Are you all going to see
a girl?

2436
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:20,375
No,to lift the girl?

2437
01:44:20,542 --> 01:44:21,667
Does she fell down?

2438
01:44:21,958 --> 01:44:23,042
You come and see there.

2439
01:44:37,542 --> 01:44:38,875
Amulu darling...

2440
01:44:39,833 --> 01:44:40,250
Ready.

2441
01:44:41,292 --> 01:44:45,125
Come out my girl...

2442
01:44:45,458 --> 01:44:50,500
Come out my girl...

2443
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:51,083
Come out

2444
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:51,917
Hey...

2445
01:44:52,292 --> 01:44:52,917
Hey stop.

2446
01:44:53,458 --> 01:44:54,000
Who are you?

2447
01:44:54,125 --> 01:44:55,292
You repeat things.

2448
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:56,167
What do you want?

2449
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:57,792
We want you...

2450
01:44:58,458 --> 01:44:58,667
Oh...

2451
01:44:59,000 --> 01:44:59,250
Oh...

2452
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:07,708
Hey,

2453
01:45:07,917 --> 01:45:11,542
(A boasting phrase)

2454
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:12,792
Okay brother.

2455
01:45:15,167 --> 01:45:16,542
A black parrot,

2456
01:45:16,875 --> 01:45:20,750
...is now going
to peck the fruit

2457
01:45:20,833 --> 01:45:21,375
Who are you?

2458
01:45:21,625 --> 01:45:22,708
Who is this old fogey?

2459
01:45:22,708 --> 01:45:24,500
If the village head knows,
He'll slay you.

2460
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:27,250
Your village head
has become my slave.

2461
01:45:31,167 --> 01:45:32,000
Hey give that.

2462
01:45:32,792 --> 01:45:34,708
You abducted me
when I'm alone.

2463
01:45:35,083 --> 01:45:36,625
Yes,if he was with his wife...

2464
01:45:38,292 --> 01:45:40,167
At dawn,when you said,
you want to rope in...

2465
01:45:40,292 --> 01:45:41,625
...I thought it must be a girl,

2466
01:45:41,667 --> 01:45:42,917
But you tied a human here.

2467
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:43,708
Aah.

2468
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:45,583
If my clan look at this,

2469
01:45:45,958 --> 01:45:47,375
Everyone is looking at,
but they didn't do anything.

2470
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:48,167
Let them look well.

2471
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:50,958
It's better to get mocked.

2472
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:52,792
He is having sickle.

2473
01:45:57,083 --> 01:45:58,083
You show it to me?

2474
01:45:58,333 --> 01:46:00,000
We are villain in the past.
-What about now?

2475
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:01,542
Okay,leave it.

2476
01:46:01,917 --> 01:46:03,958
Hey,if my captain comes,
your chapter will be closed

2477
01:46:04,167 --> 01:46:05,083
Who is your captain?

2478
01:46:05,583 --> 01:46:05,958
Call him.

2479
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:07,917
Why do you call him now?

2480
01:46:08,042 --> 01:46:08,708
I'll call him.

2481
01:46:15,417 --> 01:46:15,792
Hey dude,

2482
01:46:15,917 --> 01:46:16,417
Where are you?

2483
01:46:16,958 --> 01:46:17,833
Busy in having drinks.

2484
01:46:18,083 --> 01:46:19,042
Having drinks?

2485
01:46:19,083 --> 01:46:20,167
We are tied up here.

2486
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:20,500
Is it?

2487
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:21,708
Okay.

2488
01:46:22,583 --> 01:46:22,958
Okay!

2489
01:46:29,167 --> 01:46:30,250
You greet even when tied?

2490
01:46:30,958 --> 01:46:31,458
Aah...

2491
01:46:32,042 --> 01:46:33,958
I think he didn't believe.
I'll make a video call.

2492
01:46:34,917 --> 01:46:36,042
He won't come then.

2493
01:46:40,625 --> 01:46:42,542
Dude,really we are tied up.

2494
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:43,500
Come and save us.

2495
01:46:43,708 --> 01:46:44,417
Just a minute.

2496
01:46:44,625 --> 01:46:46,042
Greetings brother!
Are you fine?

2497
01:46:46,042 --> 01:46:47,125
Why do you talk cool?

2498
01:46:47,250 --> 01:46:48,167
He won't come then.

2499
01:46:48,458 --> 01:46:50,375
He acts smart.

2500
01:46:50,542 --> 01:46:51,708
You come and save us.

2501
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:54,458
Unless you elevate
the incident,

2502
01:46:54,583 --> 01:46:55,958
he won't come.

2503
01:46:56,042 --> 01:46:57,000
You show it to me?

2504
01:46:57,083 --> 01:46:57,833
Will he come then?

2505
01:46:58,167 --> 01:46:59,375
You would've told it earlier.

2506
01:47:14,167 --> 01:47:15,167
He must have been here only.

2507
01:47:21,917 --> 01:47:24,458
How dare you abduct
my clan?

2508
01:47:25,333 --> 01:47:28,083
How dare you sent
my fiancee?

2509
01:47:29,792 --> 01:47:30,333
What do you say?

2510
01:47:30,417 --> 01:47:31,417
She is my relative.

2511
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:33,542
Our marriage was fixed
for today.

2512
01:47:34,167 --> 01:47:36,500
Do you think of me
as a kid?

2513
01:47:36,917 --> 01:47:37,917
Today is my marriage.

2514
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:40,833
She is the bride!

2515
01:47:42,292 --> 01:47:43,125
Is that the matter?

2516
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:45,333
Why do you create fuss?

2517
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,750
Auspicious time may pass on.
Get the bride.

2518
01:47:48,792 --> 01:47:49,167
It's over.

2519
01:47:50,042 --> 01:47:50,708
Hi bride,

2520
01:47:52,375 --> 01:47:52,792
Bye.

2521
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:53,583
Hey,

2522
01:47:54,250 --> 01:47:55,125
Untie them.

2523
01:47:59,875 --> 01:48:02,125
It's good he didn't interrupt.

2524
01:48:02,292 --> 01:48:03,167
If he did,

2525
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:04,833
I would've thrashed.

2526
01:48:05,875 --> 01:48:06,500
Hey dude,

2527
01:48:09,792 --> 01:48:10,583
Don't talk silly.

2528
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:11,042
Aah.

2529
01:48:11,333 --> 01:48:12,042
You'll lose your head.

2530
01:48:12,417 --> 01:48:12,750
Is it?

2531
01:48:13,708 --> 01:48:15,708
They have seen me as
a boss.

2532
01:48:16,167 --> 01:48:17,167
But haven't seen as
a mass.

2533
01:48:17,417 --> 01:48:18,917
Untie the rope,
then we'll see.

2534
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:21,000
Do what you said and go.

2535
01:48:31,667 --> 01:48:32,667
Hey... Hey...

2536
01:48:34,292 --> 01:48:36,167

2537
01:48:36,167 --> 01:48:36,750
Leave her.

2539
01:48:39,667 --> 01:48:40,292

2549
01:50:16,917 --> 01:50:18,917

01:51:24,833 --> 01:51:27,458
Hey staunch...staunch...staunch...

2553

Are you going to perform
that you were hit?

2554
01:51:59,167 --> 01:52:01,542
You don't even look tired.
How does she believe?

2555
01:52:03,625 --> 01:52:04,375
Does it pain heavy?

2556
01:52:04,958 --> 01:52:05,125
Yes.

2557
01:52:05,708 --> 01:52:06,250
Internal pain.

2558
01:52:06,958 --> 01:52:07,583
It's heavy.

2559
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:10,500
We have medicine for it.

2560
01:52:10,625 --> 01:52:11,000
Let's go.

2561
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:14,250

2562
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:25,000
They are going to sing
a song.

2563
01:52:25,167 --> 01:52:26,333
Let's go.

2564
01:52:26,875 --> 01:52:27,375

2567
01:52:57,125 --> 01:53:00,375
"Nothing lies beneath my neck,

2572
01:53:27,375 --> 01:53:31,792
what to say above that?"

2573
01:53:33,583 --> 01:53:36,792
"Nothing lies beneath my neck,

2574
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:41,417
"Tie the knot you dragon fly,"

2575
01:53:57,333 --> 01:54:03,833
"You are a bountiful Island,
a beautiful flower!"

2576
01:54:04,042 --> 01:54:09,333
"Don't apply me as a
mehandi design,"

2577
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:16,375
"Don't blab like a parrot,
Don't come near to touch,"

2578
01:54:17,167 --> 01:54:22,875
"Don't tie me with your
moustache,"

2579
01:54:23,167 --> 01:54:26,000
"I found the love sparkle
in your eyes,"

2580
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:29,750
"I haunt the crab with the
posted net,"

2581
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:35,333
"I tied your frizzy hair with
my moustache,"

2582
01:54:36,417 --> 01:54:39,167
"I catch fire by touching your
phosphorous hand,"

2583
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:42,500
"I swirl around you all the time,"

2584
01:54:43,083 --> 01:54:45,958
"I acquired you more than others,"

2585
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:56,125
Acquired you... Acquired you...

2586
01:54:56,333 --> 01:54:59,500
"Come near when I drag,

2587
01:55:00,042 --> 01:55:05,042
what to say above that?"

2588
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:09,500
"Nothing lies beneath my neck,

2589
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,167
"Tie the knot you dragon fly,"

2590
01:55:16,417 --> 01:55:23,083
"The ferocious cock is in hunger,
shall i have a feast?"

2591
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:29,458
"To the waist of the peacock,
you hold the keys..."

2592
01:56:13,625 --> 01:56:14,792
Today we marry by
exchanging of garlands!

2593
01:56:15,125 --> 01:56:18,375
Tomorrow we marry tying the knot
in presence of all!

2594
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:22,167
You are my wife!

2595
01:56:22,833 --> 01:56:23,750
I'm your husband!

2596
01:56:24,167 --> 01:56:24,542
Okay?

2597
01:56:24,792 --> 01:56:25,542
Hmm.

2598
01:56:26,625 --> 01:56:29,667
You look like a king
in this garland!

2599
01:56:29,667 --> 01:56:29,917
Is it?

2600
01:56:40,125 --> 01:56:41,167
Superb!

2601
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:48,167
Shall i take a photo
of your's in this attire?

2602
01:56:48,375 --> 01:56:49,167
Why not?

2603

Come on.

2604
01:57:03,167 --> 01:57:03,750
What does he take?

2605
01:57:05,917 --> 01:57:06,167
Hey,

2606
01:57:06,167 --> 01:57:07,750
To which century you
belong to?

2607
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Using comb!

2608
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:13,042
Style just by hands like
"super star,"

2609
01:57:16,875 --> 01:57:17,500
What do you look at?

2610
01:57:17,833 --> 01:57:18,292
Is everything okay?

2611
01:57:20,833 --> 01:57:22,917
All evil spirit must go away!

2612
01:57:23,125 --> 01:57:23,667
Okay....Okay...

2613
01:57:24,375 --> 01:57:24,542
Come.

2614
01:57:25,833 --> 01:57:26,000
Okay.

2615
01:57:29,083 --> 01:57:30,083
Come right.

2616
01:57:33,167 --> 01:57:33,958
Go left.

2617
01:57:37,125 --> 01:57:37,917
It may get dark.

2619
01:57:49,917 --> 01:57:50,333
What?

2620
01:57:51,042 --> 01:57:52,625
All take photos by cellphone,
You take by your eyes!

2621
01:57:55,125 --> 01:58:00,167
I feel rejoicing to keep you
in my eyes than in cell.

2622
01:58:00,708 --> 01:58:01,167
How is it?

2623
01:58:02,792 --> 01:58:03,583
I'm totally out!

2624
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:04,958
You...

2625
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:06,333
Seem to be different!

2626
01:58:06,833 --> 01:58:07,458
Enough....Enough...

2627
01:58:07,917 --> 01:58:08,667
Don't praise very much.

2628
01:58:10,958 --> 01:58:11,750
Not a year,

2629
01:58:12,167 --> 01:58:13,333
if we live for just a day,

2630
01:58:13,625 --> 01:58:14,917
We must live like
Kushboo to Annamalai,

2631
01:58:15,125 --> 01:58:16,417
Meena to Yejaman,

2632
01:58:16,833 --> 01:58:18,250
Kabali to Kumudha.

2633
01:58:19,958 --> 01:58:24,250
This tree bless our life
with flowers!

2634
01:58:26,167 --> 01:58:27,125
It will bless.

2635
01:58:27,458 --> 01:58:29,250
Both of you brawl
in the village.

2636
01:58:29,417 --> 01:58:30,958
But here romancing
each other.

2637
01:58:31,708 --> 01:58:34,500
I'll complain to the
village head.

2638
01:58:35,667 --> 01:58:36,583
Are you pleasing me?

2639
01:58:37,833 --> 01:58:38,333
Okay,

2640
01:58:38,542 --> 01:58:39,417

He talks as if he conducts IPL match regularly.

2647
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,250
This year,

2648
01:59:01,250 --> 01:59:06,750
We conduct "Crackers Competition."
-Crackers!

2649
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:08,958
Blast the crackers on his head.

2650

It's more louder!

2659
01:59:34,792 --> 01:59:35,458

2660
01:59:35,833 --> 01:59:39,833
Finally,
It's Fifty stars!.

2661
01:59:39,875 --> 01:59:43,125

Is it cigar burning
or crackers firing?

2669
01:59:58,167 --> 02:00:01,750
Isn't there any
valorous male in this village?

2670
02:00:02,167 --> 02:00:03,583
You can go.
-I'll slay you.

2671
02:00:03,875 --> 02:00:06,583
Who dares to fire
this cracker?

2672
02:00:06,833 --> 02:00:08,167
On behalf of
"Dhoni Fan club,"

2673
02:00:09,042 --> 02:00:09,667
We'll fire the crackers.

2674
02:00:11,917 --> 02:00:12,875
"Valorous male,"

2675
02:00:13,125 --> 02:00:15,458
Enough of it.
Be calm.

We'll fire it.

2677
02:00:16,542 --> 02:00:18,083
Have you ever lit
stove in your kitchen?

2678
02:00:18,083 --> 02:00:19,333
Go away.
-Hey...

2679
02:00:19,667 --> 02:00:20,375

Let them fire.

2686
02:00:27,833 --> 02:00:28,167

2687
02:00:28,333 --> 02:00:28,792
Are you in love?

Are in love with him.

You accept as you

2691
02:00:31,792 --> 02:00:33,125
But why must we
compromise?

2692
02:00:33,125 --> 02:00:34,208
Okay,then you love me

2693
02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:34,792
...and get compromised.

2694
02:00:35,458 --> 02:00:36,208
It's not possible.

2695
02:00:36,417 --> 02:00:37,875
You stay in the same place
where he is.

2696
02:00:37,958 --> 02:00:39,542
You drink the same water
as he do.

2697
02:00:39,542 --> 02:00:41,125
You have the same as
he have.

2698
02:00:41,583 --> 02:00:42,208
What?

2699
02:00:43,375 --> 02:00:44,125
I mean it's courage!

2700
02:00:44,292 --> 02:00:45,708
You mean courage!

2701

Hey,we'll burn the crackers.

2704
02:00:53,583 --> 02:00:54,292
It's not possible.

2705
02:00:54,375 --> 02:00:55,042
We'll burn it.

2706
02:00:55,167 --> 02:00:56,000
No,we'll.
No...

2707
02:00:56,167 --> 02:00:58,000
Why do you always
compete with us?

2708
02:00:58,083 --> 02:00:58,667
Will do like that only.

2709
02:00:59,208 --> 02:01:00,042
They started to brawl!

2710
02:01:05,208 --> 02:01:05,708
Wait,i'll come.

2711
02:01:06,542 --> 02:01:07,958
Yes,we'll.
-It's okay,

2712
02:01:07,958 --> 02:01:08,667
Let them do.

2713
02:01:08,667 --> 02:01:09,750
Always we are high.

2714
02:01:09,833 --> 02:01:10,833
Hey go away.

2715
02:01:10,958 --> 02:01:11,792
They go beyond boundaries.

2716
02:01:12,333 --> 02:01:13,417
Why do you brawl?

2717
02:01:13,625 --> 02:01:14,792
Why do you crawl?

2718
02:01:14,917 --> 02:01:15,708
She is my wife!

2719
02:01:16,292 --> 02:01:17,333
Will you listen to me
or not?

2720
02:01:17,875 --> 02:01:18,708
Do you have a coin?

2721
02:01:20,167 --> 02:01:20,750
Do anyone have?

2722
02:01:21,125 --> 02:01:21,625
For toss.

2723
02:01:23,042 --> 02:01:23,333
Take it.

2724
02:01:23,917 --> 02:01:25,625
Listen carefully,
This is my decision.

2725
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:26,958
I'll toss the coin.

2726
02:01:27,333 --> 02:01:28,167
If the coin flips numeral,

2727
02:01:28,333 --> 02:01:28,750
Then the choice is to girls!

2728
02:01:29,458 --> 02:01:30,333
If the coin flips image,
then the choice is to guys!

2729
02:01:30,542 --> 02:01:31,167
If it flips both side?

2730
02:01:31,292 --> 02:01:32,292
You'll be burnt along
with crackers.

2731
02:01:32,458 --> 02:01:32,958
Shut up.

2732
02:01:33,708 --> 02:01:34,250
You toss the coin.

2733
02:01:35,458 --> 02:01:35,875
Shall I?

2734
02:01:35,875 --> 02:01:36,250
Yes.

2735
02:01:41,625 --> 02:01:42,208
The girl's have won!

2736
02:01:42,375 --> 02:01:43,333
What did you toss?

2737
02:01:50,208 --> 02:01:51,042
Hey what?

2738
02:01:51,792 --> 02:01:58,000
A song from the movie "Murattu kalai"

2739
02:02:22,333 --> 02:02:23,875
Shall i go?

2740
02:02:24,208 --> 02:02:25,042

2747
02:03:17,625 --> 02:03:18,250
Kumar,

2748
02:03:19,458 --> 02:03:21,625
Kumar,it's more painful.

Don't leave me.

2753
02:03:33,625 --> 02:03:34,208

02:03:36,958 --> 02:03:37,583
It's good,

2756
02:03:39,375 --> 02:03:40,542
Nothing happened to you.

2757
02:03:43,083 --> 02:03:43,750

Nothing will happen to you.

2761
02:03:55,958 --> 02:03:56,542
Don't talk ill.

2762
02:03:56,917 --> 02:03:58,458
I'm breathing my last.

2763
02:04:00,792 --> 02:04:03,917
Will you do me a favour?

2764
02:04:04,958 --> 02:04:05,333
Tell me.

2765
02:04:06,583 --> 02:04:09,542
Shall i take you a photo?

2766
02:04:13,042 --> 02:04:18,583
Smile once for me.

2767
02:04:20,292 --> 02:04:21,167

2768
02:04:21,167 --> 02:04:21,708
Smile...

2769
02:04:23,375 --> 02:04:24,167
Smile...

2770
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:39,667
"I hold you in my eyes
to guard you..."

2771
02:04:41,208 --> 02:04:45,750
"Why do you left me,
cheating in presence of all?"

2772
02:04:47,125 --> 02:04:52,750
"A well with sweet water drained up
within fraction of seconds,"

2773
02:04:53,167 --> 02:04:58,125
"You fell on my lap filled
with poison,"

2774
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:04,708
"You desired to live my love,"

2775
02:05:04,958 --> 02:05:09,333
"Don't know why it was cut,"

2776
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,292
"I hold you in my eyes
to guard you..."

2777
02:05:16,792 --> 02:05:21,833
"Why do you left me
cheating in presence of all?"

2778
02:05:34,542 --> 02:05:39,542
"I have seen your face as a
blooming bud in desire,"

2779
02:05:40,458 --> 02:05:45,583
"I have seen you the angel
as mischievous,"

2780
02:05:46,458 --> 02:05:51,667
"I have seen you as the shadow
when you run around,"

2781
02:05:51,958 --> 02:05:57,542
"I have seen you as a sculpture
in your sitting posture,"

2782
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:02,458
"My eyes haven't shut
which has seen all,"

2783
02:06:04,167 --> 02:06:09,917
"Though I'm good in countenance
i can't breathe,"

2784
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:14,292
"I hold you in my eyes
to guard you..."

2785
02:06:20,583 --> 02:06:23,167
I can't be there without her.

2786
02:06:25,333 --> 02:06:27,375
So i came to this home.

2787
02:06:31,958 --> 02:06:33,750
I was roaming around.

2788
02:06:39,042 --> 02:06:40,000
Where i saw you then.

2789
02:06:41,458 --> 02:06:43,375
I lost a person in my life.

2790
02:06:44,458 --> 02:06:47,250
But you,
Lost the life in a person.

2791
02:06:48,583 --> 02:06:49,875
To tolerate this pain?

2792
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:52,125
How are you able

2793
02:06:54,250 --> 02:06:55,042
It's painful.

2794
02:06:56,292 --> 02:06:56,958
But I live for,

2795
02:06:57,458 --> 02:06:58,083
My love.

2796
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:03,042
At first,

2797
02:07:03,542 --> 02:07:04,292
Tomorrow we'll search pandi

2798
02:07:05,458 --> 02:07:07,083
...In station and market.

2799
02:07:07,333 --> 02:07:08,208
...and all over.

2800
02:07:08,875 --> 02:07:09,458
Damn sure we'll find out him.

2801
02:07:10,625 --> 02:07:11,583
You go to sleep.

2802
02:07:28,792 --> 02:07:29,667
It takes more time.

2803
02:07:30,333 --> 02:07:30,708
Do one thing.

2804
02:07:32,667 --> 02:07:33,625
You search in that side.

2805
02:07:33,792 --> 02:07:34,500
I'll go the opposite side.

2806
02:07:36,125 --> 02:07:36,417
Take it.

2807
02:07:38,875 --> 02:07:39,375
It's my photo.

2808
02:07:40,458 --> 02:07:41,167

2809
02:07:48,333 --> 02:07:48,583
Brother,

2810
02:07:49,458 --> 02:07:51,417
Did you see him anywhere?

2811
02:07:51,958 --> 02:07:56,708
Now only he asked about you.
Contrary,

2812
02:07:56,917 --> 02:07:59,792
You ask about him.

2813
02:08:00,167 --> 02:08:01,667
What's happening?
-Where did you see him?

2814
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,167
At the corner of the temple.

2815
02:08:14,875 --> 02:08:15,792
Did you see him here?

2816
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:20,083
He'll be roaming around here.

2817
02:08:20,625 --> 02:08:22,000
He was in search of you.

2818
02:08:22,458 --> 02:08:23,750
Where did you go?

2819
02:08:27,458 --> 02:08:27,917
God!

2820
02:08:28,625 --> 02:08:29,667
Get me to pandi soon.

2821
02:08:31,083 --> 02:08:31,625
Pandi,

2822
02:08:32,417 --> 02:08:33,500
Where are you?

2823
02:08:36,833 --> 02:08:37,250
What happened?

2824
02:08:38,458 --> 02:08:40,792
Pandi is somewhere here.

2825
02:08:59,583 --> 02:08:59,917
Auto...

2826
02:09:00,917 --> 02:09:01,292
Auto...

2827
02:09:02,083 --> 02:09:02,500
Auto...

2828
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:32,167

2829
02:09:35,542 --> 02:09:36,208
Nadhiya!

2830
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:39,125
Pandi,

2831
02:09:49,083 --> 02:09:50,292
Why did you leave me?

2832
02:09:51,125 --> 02:09:52,292
Where did you go?

2833
02:09:54,750 --> 02:09:56,000
Instead of leaving me,

2834
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:59,583
i would've died happily...
...if you slayed me.

2835
02:09:59,958 --> 02:10:01,375
Why did you leave me?

2836
02:10:02,125 --> 02:10:02,417
No...

2837
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:04,875
Do you know what happened?

2838
02:10:15,458 --> 02:10:15,708
What happened?

2839
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Stomach ache,

2840
02:10:18,250 --> 02:10:19,417
I can't walk.

2841
02:10:19,792 --> 02:10:21,083
Will you get me tablet?
-Sit down.

2842
02:10:23,667 --> 02:10:24,000
You be here.

2843
02:10:24,208 --> 02:10:24,500
I'll come.

2844
02:10:24,833 --> 02:10:25,208
Yes,

2845
02:10:25,458 --> 02:10:26,000
Come soon.

2846
02:10:37,125 --> 02:10:39,833
I mustn't see you
and your clan hereafter.

2847
02:10:40,917 --> 02:10:42,000
Tomorrow a new piece comes.

2848
02:10:42,208 --> 02:10:42,333
Brother,

2849
02:10:43,292 --> 02:10:43,792
Who's that?

2850
02:10:43,917 --> 02:10:44,333
Forgive me.

2851
02:10:44,958 --> 02:10:46,708
Where is the medical shop?
-Where do you come from?

2852
02:10:46,833 --> 02:10:47,125
Go away.

2853
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:48,792
You left the cover.

2854
02:10:49,167 --> 02:10:49,375
Brother...

2855
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:50,250
Brother...

2856
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:51,250
Brother...

2857
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:53,833
Hey,stop the vehicle.

2858
02:10:55,292 --> 02:10:55,958
Who are you?

2859
02:10:56,125 --> 02:10:57,000
Why are you here at
this time?

2860
02:10:57,333 --> 02:10:58,583
Sir,
I'm in search of medical shop.

2861
02:10:59,000 --> 02:10:59,875
It's dubious.

2862
02:11:00,417 --> 02:11:01,292
Check him.

2863
02:11:01,958 --> 02:11:02,583
Give me the bag.

2864
02:11:02,917 --> 02:11:03,542
It's not mine.

2865
02:11:03,708 --> 02:11:04,750
The person who went in
the bike left it.

2866
02:11:10,125 --> 02:11:11,792
It's the photos of girls.

2867
02:11:11,792 --> 02:11:14,917
What do you say?
Photos of girls from all the states.

2868
02:11:15,375 --> 02:11:16,417
Sir,Why do you talk ill?

2869
02:11:18,792 --> 02:11:20,167
Sir,
it's not mine.

2870
02:11:20,792 --> 02:11:22,292
The person who went in
the bike left it.

2871
02:11:22,667 --> 02:11:23,167
He tells lie.

2872
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:24,000
Check him thoroughly.
-Sir,

2873
02:11:25,583 --> 02:11:29,750
Sir,it's the ultimate chick!

2874
02:11:29,833 --> 02:11:30,000
Hello,

2875
02:11:32,125 --> 02:11:33,000

02:11:33,167 --> 02:11:33,542
No sir.

2877
02:11:34,375 --> 02:11:34,833
Old then?

2878
02:11:35,208 --> 02:11:36,083
The girl i'm going to marry.

2879
02:11:36,625 --> 02:11:37,000
What's her name?

2880
02:11:38,542 --> 02:11:38,792
Nadhiya.

2881
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:41,208

I'll give you the photo.

2885
02:11:44,292 --> 02:11:45,375
Will you send her for
an hour?

2886
02:11:45,375 --> 02:11:47,000
Sir,she is not that type.

2887
02:11:47,667 --> 02:11:47,875
Hey,

2888
02:11:48,333 --> 02:11:49,583

2889
02:11:49,875 --> 02:11:51,375
Whether a fresh

02:12:01,708 --> 02:12:06,000

Do you understand?

2899
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:10,792
Sir,

You suffered more to save
the modesty of your love!

2920
02:13:48,833 --> 02:13:50,000
You are not an ordinary man.

2921
02:13:50,167 --> 02:13:50,458
Brother!

2922
02:13:50,458 --> 02:13:51,375

You're together.

2932
02:14:03,625 --> 02:14:04,250

02:14:09,583 --> 02:14:11,000
Then we too will join.

2939
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,542
You both are the
first members,

2940
02:14:12,625 --> 02:14:13,083
Okay?

2941
02:14:13,583 --> 02:14:14,250
Come,let's go.

2942
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000

of our head.

Just wait a minute.

2949
02:14:54,708 --> 02:14:56,917
Why to wait for a minute?
-Then wait for two minutes.

2950
02:14:57,333 --> 02:14:58,000
It's timing!

2951

What are you looking at?

2957
02:15:43,333 --> 02:15:44,292
When someone resembles you,

2958
02:15:44,667 --> 02:15:45,667
Shouldn't there be a
resemblance of her?

2959
02:15:46,417 --> 02:15:47,500

If you touch it,
That'll be opened.

2990
02:16:51,667 --> 02:16:52,708
Hey you don't touch her.

2991
