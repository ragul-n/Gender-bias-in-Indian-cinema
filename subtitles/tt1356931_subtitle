1
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:28,968
Truth-Godliness- Beauty

2
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,804
For centuries man has tried
to understand these 3 words

3
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,471
What is Truth?

4
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:40,973
What is Godliness?

5
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:42,981
What is Beauty?

6
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:47,476
He who has seen the sun rise
sees it as the Truth

7
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:52,982
He who has seen the sun set
sees it as the Truth

8
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:57,327
In other words, Godliness
means belief...

9
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,165
...love and faith

10
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,591
But each one's concept differs

11
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:06,270
And Beauty? What is Beauty?

12
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,602
Where can one find it?
What is its content?

13
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:13,269
Is it in the beholder's eye?

14
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:18,782
If you are asked what this
is, what will you reply?

15
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:21,444
A stone, isn't it?

16
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:46,810
Now, if you are asked what it
is, what will you reply?

17
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:49,475
God...

18
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:55,152
But, what does your eye
actually see? A stone?

19
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,647
So what made a God of it?

20
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:03,087
Your belief, your faith...

21
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:06,088
...your love

22
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:10,597
Which is Truth
Godliness, Beauty

23
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,249
Isn't that
the priess daughter?

24
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:12,247
Yes, that is Rupa

25
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:14,253
I remember her as a tiny girl

26
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:18,257
She's a grown woman now.
Is she married?

27
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:19,590
Married!

28
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:24,100
The priest has tried his luck
with every boy in the village

29
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,264
But nobody is willing to get
married to this ill-fated girl

30
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:32,939
Why, whas wrong with her?
- Have you seen her face?

31
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:46,285
This is Rupa

32
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:48,617
With the ugly, burnt face

33
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:52,787
She sings hymns about
Truth, Godliness, Beauty

34
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:55,629
The truth of her life
is very bitter, indeed

35
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,964
Her life has been
unlucky, unpleasant

36
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,068
All her life, she has heard
two words: Evil and unlucky

37
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,908
As if, they were coined
at her birth

38
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:14,076
It seems like just yesterday.
Lord Krishna's birthday night

39
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:17,814
The priest, her father,
singing in the temple

40
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:21,591
Happily thinking that
at least in his old age...

41
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:25,428
...a son would be born to him

42
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,584
What is it?
A boy? How is my wife?

43
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:32,415
A premature girl. Your wife
died giving birth to her

44
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:37,090
We must go. It is the hour
of Krishna's birth

45
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,431
Her's was an ill-fated birth

46
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:48,434
Her first breath was not hers,
but snatched from her mother

47
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:54,770
She was born at the hour when
Krishna Himself was born

48
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:07,384
Listen, where are you
running off to?

49
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,394
I can't run any more

50
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:23,565
- Are you tired, uncle?
- Yes, I am tired

51
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:27,410
- You're lying?
- Lying? Come sit here

52
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,419
Of course. You always say that
life's race is a difficult one

53
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:38,247
That only cowards give up
and get tired of running

54
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,081
Are you a coward?

55
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:44,586
I can't get the better of you
when you argue

56
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:49,592
Stop jabbering and go home.
Your father must be waiting

57
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,428
Go.

58
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:08,781
Can I play?
- You! Go away, you unlucky girl

59
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:13,123
My name is Rupa.
- Rupa, the Unlucky!

60
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:17,795
Unlucky!

61
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,965
Where were you, Unlucky?

62
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:36,312
Father, my name is Rupa.
Why do people call me Unlucky?

63
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:38,806
You do too

64
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,311
Everyone says I'm unlucky

65
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:46,648
No one ever plays with me.
Why?

66
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:51,486
Why must you play with anyone?
Why do you beg for insults?

67
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,495
Henceforth, I want you
to stay with me. Les go

68
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:58,160
To the birthday party

69
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,293
The chief liked you

70
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:55,968
Now you know why I tell you
to stay with me. To learn

71
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:58,303
It will always help you

72
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:01,572
And my birthday?

73
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:06,241
Everyone's birthday is
celebrated. But not mine

74
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,754
I want to wear new clothes
and distribute sweets, too

75
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:19,428
Tell me father, why don't
you celebrate my birthday?

76
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:22,759
Because, unfortunate child,
your mother died that very day

77
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:25,927
And I don't know how to
celebrate a death anniversary

78
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,101
Understand?

79
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:31,607
Whas this?

80
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,778
She is only a child.
She means no harm

81
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:42,451
And why shouldn't her
birthday be celebrated?

82
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:45,614
Is it her fault?

83
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:51,120
I will celebrate my dear,
pretty little girl's birthday

84
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,791
You said we'd put
silver foil on the sweets

85
00:15:57,136 --> 00:16:01,232
Silver foil? Yes, I have some.
We'll put it on right away

86
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:10,575
Whas wrong?
Are you still sulking?

87
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,911
Won't you join us?

88
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:51,212
What is it?

89
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:53,958
My child, what have you done?

90
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:59,120
Celebrate some more! Why did
you not die at birth?

91
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:03,568
You're always making trouble
for me. You wretch

92
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,061
Don't cry, my child

93
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:14,740
It was all my fault. Why did I
celebrate her birthday?

94
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:19,415
Rupa's mother should have
taken me along with her

95
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,077
Don't say that

96
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:27,749
Till today, I nurtured the
hope that she would marry

97
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,251
No question of that now

98
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,264
Not only is she poor,
but ugly and unlucky as well

99
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:38,434
She will never marry

100
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:44,432
Let me marry, O God,
so my father stops worrying

101
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:49,946
Then he will stop weeping
and beating me all the time

102
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:54,617
Please hear my prayer, O God!
And let me marry

103
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:56,452
Grant my prayer

104
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:38,595
Look! The wretch! Outgrown all
her clothes and not married!

105
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:41,089
Is this not the Age of Evil?

106
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:45,929
The priest must have sinned in
his last life. Hence this girl

107
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:49,267
She will never marry

108
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,771
Where are you running to?

109
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:55,603
She always looks unhappy

110
00:18:56,682 --> 00:19:00,209
Don't go away like this.
My daughter is a jewel

111
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:04,379
I'll sell this house and give
you all I get as dowry

112
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,048
Why do you argue?

113
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:09,716
The whole village knows
how unlucky she is

114
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:15,890
I'll be honest

115
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:20,562
If she were really beautiful.
It might have been different

116
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:26,909
But your daughter's face!
Only money can compensate for it

117
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:32,081
Pay the price, we'll fix the
match. Or let us be off

118
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,583
Please wait... Shastriji!

119
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:39,747
Accept this unfortunate girl

120
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:42,083
My daughter is very meek

121
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:45,253
As soon as I collect some
money, you shall have it

122
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:47,262
We live in this village

123
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:53,929
We too live in this village.
When you have money, tell us

124
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,932
- Les go, son
- Don't leave in this manner

125
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,952
Your medicine

126
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:22,794
I'm completely and utterly
helpless, my girl

127
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:28,630
If I had some money,
I'd have got you married

128
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:31,973
You'd have your own home

129
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:36,972
Father, this is my home.
Let me stay here

130
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:42,485
Don't ask for favours.
Don't demean yourself

131
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:47,322
God willing, the person who
wants to marry will do so

132
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:49,316
Toys for sale!

133
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:53,154
Please

134
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:58,824
Which is the way to
the village of Sukhsagar?

135
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:04,265
It isn't far. Do you want to
go to the officers quarters?

136
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,761
I'll get you a carriage

137
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,271
- I'll take your bag
- No, is all right

138
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,440
I'll carry it myself

139
00:22:15,614 --> 00:22:18,606
Well, you are young and strong

140
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:24,954
Unless we help one another,
the world will be a sad place

141
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:29,621
If each one bears his own
burden, the world will survive

142
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:34,460
With your learning,
you must be right

143
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:41,133
I know that only sorrow
can be shared. Not good luck

144
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:54,643
See who's here.

145
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:59,154
I've brought the
new engineer with me

146
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:06,254
Had we known you were coming,
we'd have fetched you

147
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:09,089
Didn't you get my telegram?

148
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:12,601
It doesn't matter.
You've come at the right moment

149
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:16,263
We celebrate the opening
of the dam tomorrow

150
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,437
I supervised the
preparations myself

151
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:24,272
Do sit down.
The Chief Minister is coming

152
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:31,115
- You?
- My wife

153
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:36,284
I do the accounting for the
dam project. She does mine

154
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,622
Don't just keep sitting here.
Go see about some food

155
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:44,959
- I'll send for Jaisingh
- I'm right here, sir

156
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:51,303
Clean saahib's bungalow.
Jaisingh works at the dam

157
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:54,639
Send the bags to the bungalow

158
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:57,479
As I was saying...

159
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,247
Give me the photo

160
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:09,588
Your mother isn't it?
Is a lovely picture

161
00:24:10,596 --> 00:24:14,088
- The most beautiful woman
- Where is your mother?

162
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,761
She is no more

163
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:25,270
I have no mother, father,
brother or sister. I am alone

164
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:31,280
When a man is all alone,
he lives in a world of his own

165
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:36,110
A dream world. And dreams are
far more beautiful than life

166
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:32,079
Your tea, sir

167
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:37,088
- Who is that?
- A village girl

168
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,420
She sings every morning

169
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:41,922
If she doesn't sing...

170
00:28:42,334 --> 00:28:44,325
...the sun wouldn't rise

171
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:47,094
- Whas her name?
- Rupa

172
00:28:54,946 --> 00:28:59,110
With a voice as beautiful,
how beautiful she must be!

173
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:31,910
Rajeev Babu!
You're still not ready!

174
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:35,250
Is every morning
like this one?

175
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:38,746
Morning? Morning is
the same everywhere

176
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:41,418
Morning is a sunrise,
evening, a sunset

177
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,421
I've never seen
a morning like this

178
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,764
Is as if I had spent my life
looking for such a morning

179
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:54,432
In fact, before I saw it,
I heard it

180
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:59,100
You heard the morning?
You missed your vacation

181
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:02,770
You should have been a poet,
not an engineer

182
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:06,278
Hurry up, or we will miss
the opening

183
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:14,289
- Good day, sir
- You look very happy

184
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:18,462
Naturally. This is a happy moment.
The dam is a boon

185
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:21,797
Our fields will be greener.
Thanks to you

186
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:28,470
Well, girls?
Ready with the song?

187
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:32,299
Do your best for the Ministers
All right?

188
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:07,572
Listen!
Where are the girls who sang?

189
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:08,901
They've gone home

190
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:17,914
- Why? What is the matter?
- Nothing

191
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:44,605
Jaisingh! The bosses are here

192
00:36:51,055 --> 00:36:54,616
Champa! Come quickly, is him

193
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:59,961
It is very kind of you
to have come

194
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:05,225
Why? Were we not to be
a part of your celebrations?

195
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:12,737
Stop him! He's leaving

196
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:23,081
You will enjoy the fair.
I'll get you a ticket

197
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:27,255
I'll see about some
food for you

198
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:34,758
No one seems to be noticing
the green bangles I'm wearing

199
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,261
- How pretty!
- Who gave them to you?

200
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:44,273
I bought them! I'd like to
have someone to give me gifts

201
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:51,104
It looks good at night

202
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:59,780
- Dark glasses at night?
- They look good

203
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,892
They ward off the evil eye

204
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:06,561
Why are you wearing them?
Which evil eye do you fear?

205
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,057
Les go, don't mix with them

206
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:16,229
They are handy for staring at
people without being obvious

207
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:20,567
Whas the point if the person
concerned doesn't know?

208
00:38:20,912 --> 00:38:22,573
You, again?

209
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:31,420
- I have the tickets. Les go
- This doesn't exist in cities

210
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:35,590
True. A village fair is
something unique to a village

211
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:38,760
Why are you following us?
What is it?

212
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:44,098
Will I get what I desire?
- Shut up! Get lost!

213
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:54,609
Why scold me now? Yesterday
morning you were staring at me

214
00:38:57,115 --> 00:39:00,710
When?
- When I was singing

215
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,551
All of you were singing
at the opening?

216
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:13,220
I didn't recognise you

217
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:19,730
- Why are you staring?
- She just happened to come by

218
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:24,235
Were you singing?
Yes, I was

219
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:28,072
- No, sir, I was singing
- I was singing

220
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:31,248
We were all singing.
Did you like our song?

221
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,074
Very much

222
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:39,416
Which of you is called Rupa?

223
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:44,918
- Who can it be, but me?
- You liar! I am Rupa

224
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:51,933
Since when is your name Rupa?
I am the one you asked about

225
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,933
No, I am Rupa
- Sir, my name is Rupa

226
00:39:57,942 --> 00:39:59,933
None of you are called Rupa

227
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:02,102
Whas in a name?

228
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:07,941
How did he know that
we were bluffing?

229
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:11,782
Had you kept quiet, he would
have taken me as Rupa

230
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:14,288
Big deal!

231
00:40:25,136 --> 00:40:28,469
Whas happening?
- Take a look at this

232
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:41,975
Whas wrong, Rajeev?

233
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:47,480
What a frightening face!
How ugly it was!

234
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:52,324
Just your reflection. We found
it funny. You were frightened?

235
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,822
No...

236
00:40:57,001 --> 00:41:01,768
but I cannot tolerate
any form of ugliness

237
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:08,943
You exaggerate, Rajeev Babu.
Can't you take a joke?

238
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:13,110
If ever you need to face reality
how will you ever do so?

239
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,110
Les go

240
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:25,288
Whose will this
Prince Charming be?

241
00:47:56,453 --> 00:47:58,614
Listen!
- Yes?

242
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:06,060
You live in this village?
- Yes

243
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:11,900
I hear you sing everyday. Your
voice is a gift from the Gods

244
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:13,734
It is wonderful!

245
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:22,072
- I don't know you, but...
- I don't know you either

246
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:27,740
If we let that stop us,
we would all be strangers

247
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:43,594
I'm Rajeev. I work on
the dam as an engineer

248
00:48:45,102 --> 00:48:47,093
Won't you tell me your name?

249
00:49:28,412 --> 00:49:30,403
What shall I call you?

250
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:37,585
You give the flowers
their perfume

251
00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:42,252
And the moon is light

252
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:47,090
I am fascinated by you
Don't turn away

253
00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:51,257
Listen! It is to you
that I am talking

254
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:55,268
Next time, don't say
that you don't know me

255
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:04,946
O Krishna! How charismatic...

256
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:11,784
...and wonderfully self
composed is your image

257
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:20,290
O Krishna! You rule
the whole world

258
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:26,793
Your dark velvety skin
is like the black sky at night

259
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:35,802
O Krishna! Your lotus-shaped
eyes, are beautiful and...

260
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:42,308
...as steadfast
as a sains devotion

261
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:50,317
O Krishna! To You
we offer our prayers

262
00:50:52,162 --> 00:50:57,657
For it is you who give us
the courage to go through life

263
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:53,145
Whas up?

264
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:57,825
My dear, pretty little girl.
You look very happy today

265
00:51:57,995 --> 00:52:04,924
- How did you guess?
- Some things cannot be hidden

266
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:10,100
They stand out from afar

267
00:52:11,275 --> 00:52:13,266
Really? Then, tell me

268
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:19,610
Who gives the moon its light?
And the flowers their perfume?

269
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:25,282
Who said all this to you?
Who did you meet in the temple?

270
00:52:25,856 --> 00:52:29,121
In the temple?
Who could I have met there?

271
00:52:31,795 --> 00:52:33,786
Other than God

272
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:37,798
- Is that so?
- But I didn't go to the temple

273
00:52:38,135 --> 00:52:40,126
Then where have you been?

274
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:45,637
I... went searching...
for the donkey's washerman

275
00:52:46,143 --> 00:52:49,135
Yes, he was lost, so...

276
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,813
Come here

277
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:01,916
Not the donkey's washerman,
the washerman's donkey

278
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:19,269
Come, sit down, Rajeev Babu.
Make a note of this

279
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:22,609
- Not now, later
- Will you have a banana?

280
00:53:25,782 --> 00:53:28,615
What is it?
- I'm eating

281
00:53:29,953 --> 00:53:34,117
Carry on eating. There is
something I'd like to ask

282
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:36,122
Go ahead

283
00:53:38,462 --> 00:53:43,798
Have you ever... ever...

284
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:46,629
Ever, what?
- Been in love?

285
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:50,129
I got married 30 years ago

286
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:54,307
I mean before that

287
00:53:55,979 --> 00:54:01,747
Did you ever fall madly in
love, at first sight?

288
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:06,419
With someone who filled
your every waking thought

289
00:54:08,091 --> 00:54:14,428
Someone you are never tired of
watching? Who distracted you?

290
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:18,098
What is the matter?

291
00:54:19,102 --> 00:54:24,597
I'm feeling sorry not to have
experienced these emotions

292
00:54:26,944 --> 00:54:29,777
The boss has sent for you

293
00:54:32,783 --> 00:54:34,774
I'm coming. See you some time

294
00:54:41,959 --> 00:54:44,291
- What is the flying level?
- 17005/8, sir

295
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:49,626
- 17001/3, sir.
- Yes, write it

296
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:53,296
At point A, 1.235...

297
00:54:54,638 --> 00:54:58,631
...and at point B, 2.05

298
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,070
Got it?

299
00:55:21,932 --> 00:55:25,424
Height: 5 feet, 7 inches

300
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:30,763
Chest: 36. No, 38

301
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:34,276
38 feet?
- Idiot! Not feet, inches

302
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:38,604
Waist: 24

303
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:43,446
Is it a girl?
- Next, write: 38

304
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:46,112
38-24-38!

305
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:47,779
How does she look?

306
00:55:50,293 --> 00:55:54,787
It is the face that I can't
see. Take over, I'll be back

307
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:07,566
Inches or metres?

308
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:13,576
Listen...

309
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:15,740
Look here!

310
00:56:18,088 --> 00:56:22,081
I didn't want to come at all,
today. But I had to

311
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:31,265
Your village is very
picturesque and attractive

312
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:35,769
The fields, the mountains,
the stream. And these flowers

313
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,776
So lovely! But poor things.
To have to suffer these thorns

314
00:56:42,446 --> 00:56:44,437
Doesn't it make you glad...

315
00:56:45,949 --> 00:56:48,110
...that the thorns
enjoy the flowers?

316
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:54,781
What about the poor bee,
in whose way the thorns come?

317
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:57,286
Why do you talk of the bee?

318
00:56:58,128 --> 00:57:01,564
He fickle- mindedly flits
from flower to flower.

319
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:04,724
You have lovely ideas

320
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:07,897
The only beautiful part of me

321
00:57:09,406 --> 00:57:12,398
Your singing too
- You've said that before

322
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:18,571
You are very beautiful
to look at as well

323
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:29,582
As beautiful as your voice,
the songs you sing

324
00:57:36,266 --> 00:57:39,599
Oh! I was forgetting

325
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:44,764
I wrote something about you.
Just... by the way

326
00:57:47,778 --> 00:57:49,769
Do take it

327
00:57:54,618 --> 00:57:56,609
Read it

328
00:57:57,454 --> 00:58:00,719
The fantasies my imagination
has woven about you

329
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:03,716
That is how beautiful you are

330
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:12,732
- This is Rajeev Babu's file
- Is this an office file?

331
00:58:12,836 --> 00:58:16,237
Yes. Look, there is a sketch
of the dam in here

332
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:20,232
What to do in case of flood.
And below it, a short poem

333
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:24,745
Just wait a little longer for,
sooner on later you will see

334
00:58:25,248 --> 00:58:29,912
A tall, fair and slim maiden.
What eyes... lips, hair, face!

335
00:58:32,255 --> 00:58:37,921
Here comes the young romantic.
- We were just talking about you

336
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:41,086
- Come, sit. I'll get some food
- No, thanks. I am not hungry

337
00:58:41,264 --> 00:58:44,756
Of course!
How can you be hungry?

338
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:49,432
You've eaten, haven't you?
Leave me alone!

339
00:58:49,773 --> 00:58:51,764
We will

340
00:58:52,108 --> 00:58:57,273
A tall, slim and fair maiden.
What eyes... lips, hair, face!

341
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:01,707
I was just scribbling

342
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:04,880
Tell us. Is she very beautiful?

343
00:59:06,723 --> 00:59:10,887
Who?
- The girl in this sketch

344
00:59:14,231 --> 00:59:16,392
I haven't seen her properly

345
00:59:18,068 --> 00:59:20,059
Only her eyes

346
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:24,233
They are like black velvet.
And, I've heard her sing

347
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:31,575
I feel sure that with a voice
like that, she must be lovely

348
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:41,083
Tantalizing

349
00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:43,919
Soothing

350
00:59:44,761 --> 00:59:46,752
Gentle

351
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,421
Pure

352
01:06:07,744 --> 01:06:11,407
No! I am not
what you imagine me to be

353
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:18,084
You imagine that I am
beautiful. I am quite ugly

354
01:06:19,756 --> 01:06:25,592
Forget about me! I am not
good enough for you

355
01:06:27,764 --> 01:06:34,761
Why are you fooling yourself?
All because of a silly poem

356
01:06:35,938 --> 01:06:40,932
There's a world between us.
Nothing can come of this

357
01:06:44,113 --> 01:06:47,776
True! We can never
come together

358
01:06:49,118 --> 01:06:51,109
Never ever

359
01:06:51,788 --> 01:06:57,624
So let him believe
you are beautiful if he wants to

360
01:06:59,962 --> 01:07:02,226
You are enjoying it too

361
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:40,425
- What is it?
- Will you deliver this bundle?

362
01:07:41,437 --> 01:07:43,428
In a minute, when I'm finished

363
01:08:08,898 --> 01:08:11,731
Listen!

364
01:08:13,002 --> 01:08:16,233
Did you read that letter?

365
01:08:17,073 --> 01:08:22,067
Tell me truthfully. How do you
like my ideas, my poetry?

366
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:25,070
I wrote on an impulse

367
01:08:26,582 --> 01:08:28,743
I had never actually seen you

368
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:33,916
Yet, I can recognise you
by your footsteps

369
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:38,417
Tell me,
did you like my poetry?

370
01:08:39,095 --> 01:08:42,258
Will you just write,
or will you also act?

371
01:08:44,434 --> 01:08:46,595
You? You are not Rupa?

372
01:08:48,604 --> 01:08:52,096
I'm sorry.
I mistook you for Rupa

373
01:08:53,276 --> 01:08:56,109
Beauty is a flower that fades

374
01:08:56,612 --> 01:09:00,708
Don't waste time admiring it,
but enjoy it immediately

375
01:09:01,217 --> 01:09:03,549
You are misunderstanding me

376
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:09,889
How does it matter? I've been
dreaming about you for days

377
01:09:12,061 --> 01:09:15,053
No, I mean,
I made a mistake

378
01:09:16,065 --> 01:09:19,398
Why leave the mistake half
done? Finish it

379
01:09:20,169 --> 01:09:24,401
What are you doing? I am not
that sort of man! Honestly

380
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:30,410
Why are you shy, as a maiden?

381
01:09:44,093 --> 01:09:47,085
So far, I had only heard
that love made one blind

382
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:50,091
Now, I'm seeing it

383
01:09:55,271 --> 01:09:58,763
When a man slips up,
he blames it on love

384
01:10:00,276 --> 01:10:03,268
Never mind. In future,
I'll look before I leap

385
01:10:03,513 --> 01:10:05,504
Don't rely on your eyes

386
01:10:06,282 --> 01:10:12,278
They can deceive. Only a blind
heart can show the right way

387
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:17,282
I'll close my eyes

388
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:21,285
Show me the way, O heart.
Where should I go?

389
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:26,291
To the falls
You've sullied your face

390
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:29,961
But saved my reputation

391
01:10:32,308 --> 01:10:34,299
Come on

392
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:53,322
Why did my heart leap?

393
01:10:53,829 --> 01:10:56,821
Will you open your eyes?

394
01:10:58,334 --> 01:11:05,763
I saw you with my eyes closed.
I refuse to open them, now

395
01:11:06,609 --> 01:11:08,600
You'll fall and get hurt.

396
01:11:08,945 --> 01:11:11,436
I still refuse to open my eyes.

397
01:11:12,949 --> 01:11:16,441
- Come on, then
- Les go

398
01:11:22,959 --> 01:11:24,950
You want to be a poet?

399
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:58,316
Where are you?

400
01:11:59,662 --> 01:12:01,596
Had enough of being a poet?

401
01:12:41,137 --> 01:12:44,629
What are you looking at?
Is my skin very tanned?

402
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:54,310
Thas because, at the dam,
I work under the sun

403
01:12:56,152 --> 01:12:58,143
You're very fair!

404
01:13:00,256 --> 01:13:03,248
Do you know, as a child,
I was really dark?

405
01:13:04,093 --> 01:13:06,926
I used to keep
bothering my mother about it

406
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:12,757
I used to say,
The Fairy Queen is fair. Isn't she?

407
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:15,593
Yes, was her reply
So I'd say...

408
01:13:16,105 --> 01:13:18,767
She won't marry me will she?
I'm so dark

409
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:26,103
What...

410
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:29,114
...was her reply?

411
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:31,446
Her reply?

412
01:13:31,787 --> 01:13:38,454
She'd apply a dot of kohl on
my forehead to ward off evil

413
01:13:39,128 --> 01:13:44,623
You know, Krishna often asked
His mother this question

414
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:46,957
What?

415
01:13:53,309 --> 01:13:59,976
To his mother Yashoda,
Lord Krishna posed a question.

416
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:07,246
Why is Radha fair?
And why am I so dark?

417
01:14:15,631 --> 01:14:18,930
Fantastic! Exactly what
I used to ask mother

418
01:14:19,602 --> 01:14:21,263
And what was her reply?

419
01:14:23,606 --> 01:14:30,102
The mother smilingly answered

420
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:44,958
Fair and lovely Radha
has dark black eyes

421
01:14:46,295 --> 01:14:49,287
This black-eyed beauty...

422
01:14:53,803 --> 01:14:59,799
has cast a spell on you

423
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:03,572
You now know why
you are so dark

424
01:15:26,936 --> 01:15:28,927
She was absolutely right

425
01:15:30,105 --> 01:15:34,599
Now I see that it is my Rupa's
spell that makes me dark

426
01:15:36,111 --> 01:15:38,944
Thas not true

427
01:15:39,448 --> 01:15:43,111
No? Then why are you
always staring at me?

428
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:45,118
And casting spells on me

429
01:15:51,527 --> 01:15:57,796
At this very moment,
Radha sauntered into the room

430
01:16:06,075 --> 01:16:12,241
I have cast no spell.
She said liltingly

431
01:16:13,582 --> 01:16:16,574
Mother, your son

432
01:16:20,589 --> 01:16:26,425
Is unique in this world

433
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,096
You now know why
He is so dark

434
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:58,290
I must concede you are good
at arguing your case

435
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:21,068
My Lord and Master

436
01:18:21,477 --> 01:18:25,914
What are you doing?
What is happening to me?

437
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:32,414
Why are you lighting the flame
of love in my heart?

438
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:37,415
Unfortunate, unlucky
and ugly that I am

439
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:41,252
Bringing sorrow to people

440
01:18:43,265 --> 01:18:45,597
Why are you awakening
a yearning for love within me?

441
01:19:05,054 --> 01:19:08,387
Don't let the shadow of
my misfortune fall on him

442
01:19:10,225 --> 01:19:12,386
He can never be happy with me

443
01:19:15,064 --> 01:19:19,057
If anything happens to him,
I will never forgive myself

444
01:19:20,903 --> 01:19:22,894
No, God. No!

445
01:19:23,238 --> 01:19:28,733
I don't want to be happy.
I don't want anything

446
01:19:40,255 --> 01:19:44,248
Rupa! What is the matter?

447
01:19:46,595 --> 01:19:48,586
Nothing

448
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:54,599
Won't you tell me
what is troubling you?

449
01:19:55,604 --> 01:20:00,769
Somethings cannot be
shared with strangers

450
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:05,941
Let me go
- Am I a stranger?

451
01:20:07,616 --> 01:20:11,108
I am yours
I want to make you mine

452
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:16,280
Don't even think such things.
You don't know...

453
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:17,948
I don't want to know

454
01:20:18,961 --> 01:20:20,952
I'm very unlucky.

455
01:20:22,131 --> 01:20:27,125
Nobody has ever loved me

456
01:20:29,805 --> 01:20:33,297
I've learnt not to expect
any affection from people

457
01:20:34,810 --> 01:20:36,801
Love would be too much for me

458
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:46,311
I am not worthy of your love

459
01:20:49,658 --> 01:20:52,149
No, Rupa.
Don't say such things

460
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,657
Don't say such things

461
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:03,261
I will love you

462
01:21:04,273 --> 01:21:07,936
More than anyone has ever done

463
01:21:36,638 --> 01:21:41,132
Why do you love me?

464
01:21:42,978 --> 01:21:44,969
Because I am beautiful?

465
01:21:46,148 --> 01:21:50,482
Would you still love me
if I was ugly?

466
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:57,818
You couldn't be ugly
Not with a voice like yours

467
01:21:58,827 --> 01:22:00,260
I refuse to believe
that you could be ugly

468
01:22:00,562 --> 01:22:03,087
Accidents have been known
to happen

469
01:22:03,932 --> 01:22:08,767
If I were to lose my voice
or to become disfigured

470
01:22:09,938 --> 01:22:12,600
Would you still...

471
01:22:13,108 --> 01:22:15,099
Stop it, Rupa

472
01:22:16,945 --> 01:22:18,435
The idea makes me sick

473
01:22:19,615 --> 01:22:23,278
I'd rather go deaf than
have you lose your voice

474
01:22:24,453 --> 01:22:27,786
Or become blind before
you are disfigured

475
01:22:35,631 --> 01:22:37,792
Why is your face
always veiled?

476
01:22:38,467 --> 01:22:39,957
Are you shy?

477
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:42,968
- No, I'm not
- Then what is it?

478
01:22:43,972 --> 01:22:46,805
Don't you love me?
And don't I love you?

479
01:22:47,142 --> 01:22:51,135
I'll die if you ever even
joke about my not loving you

480
01:22:51,713 --> 01:22:54,307
Tell me
- There is no reason...

481
01:22:56,318 --> 01:22:58,149
and yet there is every reason

482
01:22:59,988 --> 01:23:04,925
Les say, this veil can only
be lifted on my wedding night

483
01:23:06,995 --> 01:23:09,088
That moment is one
I may never know

484
01:23:20,108 --> 01:23:21,097
You, there

485
01:23:21,443 --> 01:23:25,607
- Where does Rupa live?
- Which Rupa, sir?

486
01:23:33,622 --> 01:23:36,113
The girl who stays
in your village

487
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:39,291
The priess daughter?
What has she done?

488
01:23:40,128 --> 01:23:42,961
Nothing. I just wanted
to know where she lived

489
01:23:43,298 --> 01:23:46,131
She lives near here.
Is everything all right?

490
01:23:47,135 --> 01:23:49,626
Take me there.
I'll explain to you

491
01:23:51,139 --> 01:23:52,470
Come with me

492
01:23:53,809 --> 01:23:55,800
Priest

493
01:23:57,145 --> 01:24:00,911
Why are you hiding inside?
Come out and see who's here

494
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:05,576
This is the priest,
Rupa's father. I'll be back

495
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:12,083
Good day. I'm Rajeev.
I work at the dam

496
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:15,919
Won't you sit down?

497
01:24:18,266 --> 01:24:23,761
This jeep here? Look!
Rajeev Babu is here

498
01:24:24,272 --> 01:24:26,763
Now tell me what
you wanted to say

499
01:24:39,454 --> 01:24:40,443
I...

500
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:47,625
Speak up

501
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,789
Go on

502
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:58,303
Stop stuttering. He wants
to marry your daughter

503
01:24:58,473 --> 01:24:59,804
Go on, say it

504
01:25:02,577 --> 01:25:04,067
Whas wrong?

505
01:25:06,248 --> 01:25:07,738
Are you ill?

506
01:25:11,253 --> 01:25:14,416
Does he know all about her?

507
01:25:15,257 --> 01:25:22,425
I won't deceive you. I have
no dowry for my daughter

508
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:25,256
I want nothing, sir

509
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:29,092
As for clothes and
jewelry for her...

510
01:25:29,604 --> 01:25:32,437
...I'll shower her with gifts

511
01:25:32,974 --> 01:25:37,775
You haven't seen her.
I know she's very virtuous...

512
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:41,613
...but I still think
you should see her properly

513
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:48,621
No, sir. We both know each
other. We've already met

514
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:55,792
He has thought things over.
Decide upon the wedding date

515
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:01,068
Shall we say, next Monday?

516
01:26:01,336 --> 01:26:04,897
Yes, by all means.
We have no reason to wait

517
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,901
Does Rupa know the news?
- Les tell her

518
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:15,243
May God bless you, son.
May you be happy, always

519
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:18,909
May you never know
a moment of sorrow

520
01:26:23,258 --> 01:26:26,591
I'm tired out from
all this running

521
01:26:26,928 --> 01:26:29,761
One form of torture
after another!

522
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,089
Whas up?

523
01:26:33,168 --> 01:26:35,762
The love of my life
went to your father

524
01:26:39,274 --> 01:26:41,765
And asked for your hand
in marriage

525
01:26:42,043 --> 01:26:44,443
No!

526
01:26:46,615 --> 01:26:48,606
Where are you going?

527
01:27:14,576 --> 01:27:16,737
Why didn't you wait to see me!

528
01:27:19,915 --> 01:27:24,409
Brothers! I couldn't have done
it without your good wishes

529
01:27:24,753 --> 01:27:29,087
I still can't believe it!
He actually asked for her hand!

530
01:27:29,257 --> 01:27:33,421
Truly, God may be slow
to act, but act He surely does

531
01:27:34,095 --> 01:27:38,759
- Put down Rs. 101 from me
- And 51 from me

532
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:40,431
Stop this talk!

533
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:44,328
I won't marry him

534
01:27:44,773 --> 01:27:45,762
What did you say?

535
01:27:46,107 --> 01:27:50,441
I know him well. He will make
you happy. He's a fine man

536
01:27:51,112 --> 01:27:55,105
Which is precisely why we
can't deceive him in this way

537
01:27:55,283 --> 01:27:59,117
There is no deceit involved.
He came of his own free will

538
01:27:59,287 --> 01:28:02,222
He said he knew you well
and had seen you

539
01:28:02,724 --> 01:28:06,717
The Rupa he knows...
is not me

540
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:09,221
Then, who is it?

541
01:28:09,898 --> 01:28:14,392
Look at this foolish girl!

542
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:16,730
Can you make her see reason?

543
01:28:17,238 --> 01:28:22,232
Don't speak in riddles, child.
Explain yourself clearly

544
01:28:22,911 --> 01:28:27,075
What can I say? He thinks
that I am beautiful

545
01:28:27,749 --> 01:28:31,583
And I... well I know
what I am

546
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,211
Do you know yourself?

547
01:28:34,756 --> 01:28:38,920
What beauty are you referring to?
Does beauty lie in a face?

548
01:28:39,594 --> 01:28:40,925
Is it only skin deep?

549
01:28:41,262 --> 01:28:46,598
The skin will rot one day.
The body will turn into ashes

550
01:28:47,102 --> 01:28:51,266
True beauty is a state
of mind, a virtuous soul

551
01:28:51,773 --> 01:28:53,764
You can't say why he likes you

552
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:56,101
He has never seen me properly

553
01:28:56,277 --> 01:29:00,213
But he has chosen you. Is that
not proof enough of his love?

554
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:03,040
He wants you
Not your face

555
01:29:03,385 --> 01:29:07,549
How can I explain to you?

556
01:29:07,989 --> 01:29:12,392
Not every woman can be
beautiful. Nor every man

557
01:29:12,894 --> 01:29:17,228
But when we love someone,
we find that person beautiful

558
01:29:17,732 --> 01:29:23,398
Nobody can fall in love
with me. Everyone hates me

559
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:27,235
Everyone always rejects me

560
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:30,067
Everything changes with time

561
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:34,579
There was a time when your
father had to plead in vain

562
01:29:34,916 --> 01:29:38,579
See the turn of events now.
A prince from afar...

563
01:29:39,754 --> 01:29:42,086
...wants to carry you away

564
01:29:43,091 --> 01:29:49,758
Spring is at your door.
Don't refuse it entry

565
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:54,258
He is right, Rupa.
- Don't question your good luck

566
01:29:54,669 --> 01:29:58,264
No! I tell you,
it will be a disaster

567
01:29:58,773 --> 01:30:01,435
Marriages are made in Heaven

568
01:30:02,277 --> 01:30:06,771
By the will of God. By what
right may we intervene?

569
01:30:07,782 --> 01:30:10,774
I beg you.

570
01:30:11,286 --> 01:30:17,282
Kill me, but stop
this marriage at all costs

571
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:21,284
Don't be obstinate. Your
father has long wanted this

572
01:30:21,963 --> 01:30:24,625
Don't crush his
hopes for a whim

573
01:30:25,133 --> 01:30:31,129
If he has to bear any further
grief, it may kill him

574
01:30:34,642 --> 01:30:37,975
Say yes

575
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:22,678
Wait there!

576
01:32:28,685 --> 01:32:30,846
Put your right foot forward

577
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:43,530
May you bring
good luck with you

578
01:32:48,205 --> 01:32:53,199
Let me see your face, first.
We can do these rites later

579
01:33:00,217 --> 01:33:04,210
Why are you so shy?
Is me, not Rajeev Babu

580
01:33:31,014 --> 01:33:33,175
Don't be silly.
And don't talk rubbish

581
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:36,347
Enjoy yourself. You can play
all night long

582
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:39,512
And eat well.
Here's some money

583
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:48,691
- How can that be?
- My wife says so

584
01:34:29,172 --> 01:34:35,008
Who are you?

585
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:43,844
You are not Rupa. You are not!

586
01:34:44,521 --> 01:34:50,016
This is not Rupa.
- This is some other girl

587
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:54,353
I am the same girl

588
01:34:55,365 --> 01:34:58,357
Don't lie. You are not Rupa

589
01:34:59,469 --> 01:35:03,701
Aunty, you tell me.
But you have never seen her

590
01:35:08,545 --> 01:35:10,536
Come here

591
01:35:12,382 --> 01:35:15,215
Look at this girl, Jaisingh.
Look at her properly

592
01:35:15,619 --> 01:35:18,383
Is this the girl who sings
in the temple?

593
01:35:18,822 --> 01:35:21,382
Yes, it is
She is Rupa

594
01:35:21,725 --> 01:35:25,491
No! She is not
- But you always asked about her.

595
01:35:25,662 --> 01:35:29,826
No it is not.
I know another Rupa

596
01:35:31,334 --> 01:35:37,671
Listen.
There has been a mistake

597
01:35:38,341 --> 01:35:44,507
But there is no harm done.
Go back to your village

598
01:35:45,181 --> 01:35:49,515
Don't say such things.
Please! I cannot go back

599
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:53,183
Will you go or won't you?
Or shall we throw you out?

600
01:35:53,356 --> 01:35:57,690
You can't do such things!
After all, you married her

601
01:35:57,794 --> 01:36:03,198
Married? A ceremony on its
own is no marriage

602
01:36:03,533 --> 01:36:07,367
I don't accept this marriage
- Like it or not

603
01:36:07,871 --> 01:36:10,533
Society accepts her
as your wife

604
01:36:11,007 --> 01:36:14,534
No. I'll go mad

605
01:36:15,045 --> 01:36:17,878
She can't be my wife
- I agree

606
01:36:18,214 --> 01:36:20,876
I can't accept her
- All right

607
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,653
I don't so much as know you

608
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:32,658
I can have nothing
to do with you, ever

609
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:35,320
I agree to everything you say

610
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:42,833
But don't throw me out of the
house. Ill kill my father

611
01:36:45,375 --> 01:36:48,833
We made a mistake.
She is not to blame

612
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:51,836
She is married to you, now

613
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:54,506
Where will she go?
This is her home now

614
01:36:55,018 --> 01:36:57,009
Then she can have it

615
01:36:58,021 --> 01:37:00,854
But I'm telling you.
She is nothing to me

616
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:03,853
No relationship
binds me to her

617
01:37:07,197 --> 01:37:09,188
- Listen
- Move away!

618
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,192
Wait, Rajeev Babu!

619
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:21,033
Why did he leave
in a fit of temper?

620
01:37:21,377 --> 01:37:25,313
I don't understand anything

621
01:37:27,984 --> 01:37:30,475
It seems that he married
the wrong Rupa

622
01:37:31,321 --> 01:37:33,482
- So it appears
- Don't be silly

623
01:37:33,656 --> 01:37:37,148
Sit down and eat.
Things will work out fine

624
01:37:59,182 --> 01:38:04,017
Where are you, Rupa? Come and
see how I've been cheated

625
01:38:04,521 --> 01:38:08,013
Only you can understand
my pain. Won't you come?

626
01:38:08,858 --> 01:38:10,849
Please come, Rupa

627
01:38:11,194 --> 01:38:13,185
I've been very badly hurt

628
01:40:31,301 --> 01:40:36,796
Whas wrong with you?
Don't you recognise your Rupa?

629
01:40:37,974 --> 01:40:40,135
You appreciated my thoughts

630
01:40:41,978 --> 01:40:43,969
You fell in love
with my singing

631
01:40:45,815 --> 01:40:46,804
Didn't you?

632
01:40:47,817 --> 01:40:49,808
Well, listen

633
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:53,483
You don't recognise my face

634
01:40:55,325 --> 01:40:57,316
At least recognise my voice

635
01:42:19,075 --> 01:42:21,066
You? Here, before me?

636
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:27,513
Why don't you go away?
- There is something I must say

637
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:37,348
Rupa! Wait for me!

638
01:46:50,179 --> 01:46:52,511
Rupa, wait!

639
01:46:56,519 --> 01:46:59,852
Stop, for Goïs sake
Don't go away

640
01:47:07,363 --> 01:47:11,356
What is this madness?
Where were you?

641
01:47:12,034 --> 01:47:14,025
You don't know my plight

642
01:47:15,204 --> 01:47:17,866
I've married some other girl
instead of you

643
01:47:18,374 --> 01:47:22,811
They say there is only one
Rupa. But I know otherwise

644
01:47:23,479 --> 01:47:29,475
You are my Rupa. My life,
my love, my everything

645
01:47:33,155 --> 01:47:35,487
I married you, not her.
You are my wife

646
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:39,150
Come with me

647
01:47:42,164 --> 01:47:44,826
Where to?
- To my home

648
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:51,162
That is where
you shall live

649
01:47:55,511 --> 01:48:00,175
And the woman you married?
Where will she live?

650
01:48:01,183 --> 01:48:05,517
I don't know. But I won't go
back to that house without you

651
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:11,186
Is that all right?

652
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,351
I'll come to your
village with you

653
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:17,355
And ruin your reputation!

654
01:48:19,702 --> 01:48:21,693
Make me hang my head in shame

655
01:48:22,471 --> 01:48:24,462
Then, what shall I do?

656
01:48:27,143 --> 01:48:31,978
I can't live without you
Not for a single moment

657
01:48:33,649 --> 01:48:39,315
I'll tell you what to do.
Do as I say

658
01:48:41,490 --> 01:48:45,824
Go back home
- I can't do that

659
01:48:49,165 --> 01:48:51,497
You will have to, for today

660
01:48:54,003 --> 01:48:55,994
I promise you

661
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:03,172
Your Rupa will meet you at
the usual spot as before

662
01:49:05,347 --> 01:49:08,510
Every evening,
just as we used to

663
01:49:11,954 --> 01:49:16,516
Yes, I will
Go back home

664
01:49:22,031 --> 01:49:23,965
Don't ever try to follow me

665
01:49:25,634 --> 01:49:30,469
If anyone sees us?
My reputation depends on you

666
01:51:36,365 --> 01:51:40,699
Why don't you love your wife?

667
01:51:42,371 --> 01:51:44,362
Is she so bad?

668
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:49,374
Is not a question of good
or bad. She is not my Rupa

669
01:51:50,045 --> 01:51:51,034
You are

670
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:54,372
What do I have
that she does not?

671
01:51:54,883 --> 01:51:56,874
What does she have?

672
01:51:57,553 --> 01:52:02,217
Does she have your qualities?
Your mind? Your lovely eyes?

673
01:52:03,559 --> 01:52:04,548
Your beauty?

674
01:52:14,236 --> 01:52:18,900
I swear by my love, Babuji

675
01:52:20,909 --> 01:52:26,347
Don't ever try to unveil me
or you'll see my dead body

676
01:52:27,182 --> 01:52:28,513
Don't punish me so harshly

677
01:52:29,685 --> 01:52:32,176
Will I never be able
to see your face?

678
01:52:33,022 --> 01:52:35,013
Agree to my condition, first

679
01:52:35,190 --> 01:52:38,353
What?
- Accept your wife

680
01:52:40,529 --> 01:52:45,694
The day you start loving her,
this veil will fall on its own

681
01:52:46,035 --> 01:52:49,527
No, Rupa. I cannot
do that, ever

682
01:52:49,872 --> 01:52:53,535
One even starts loving an
animal that lives in the house

683
01:52:56,045 --> 01:52:59,879
After all, she is a woman.
And besides, she's your wife

684
01:53:02,051 --> 01:53:03,211
She has a right to you

685
01:59:35,143 --> 01:59:40,979
Sir, sign these papers.
Is very urgent

686
02:00:07,843 --> 02:00:10,175
Won't you go home?

687
02:00:12,013 --> 02:00:13,503
Go home? What for?

688
02:00:14,015 --> 02:00:16,506
You can go.
Lock the office

689
02:00:59,995 --> 02:01:01,656
Stop where you are, you slut!

690
02:01:02,164 --> 02:01:04,325
Setting fire to another's home

691
02:01:04,766 --> 02:01:09,499
Enjoying yourself, you bitch.
And his poor wife is miserable

692
02:01:09,671 --> 02:01:10,660
Who are you?

693
02:01:14,342 --> 02:01:16,833
Stop! Slut.

694
02:01:19,181 --> 02:01:21,172
You won't get away
from me, you whore

695
02:01:52,214 --> 02:01:57,550
Where are you going? I'll
expose you before the village

696
02:01:59,721 --> 02:02:01,712
You!

697
02:02:04,392 --> 02:02:09,557
The master meets you here?
Does he not meet you at home?

698
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:14,231
Home?

699
02:02:18,907 --> 02:02:20,898
Where is my home?

700
02:02:24,012 --> 02:02:26,503
He never looks at me,
when I'm at home

701
02:02:28,350 --> 02:02:30,341
He hates the sight of me

702
02:02:31,853 --> 02:02:38,019
He shuns me as if this scar on
my face could contaminate him

703
02:02:40,695 --> 02:02:44,187
And if I just hide my face...

704
02:02:46,201 --> 02:02:49,034
...I become the woman
of his dreams

705
02:02:51,206 --> 02:02:53,197
He drowns me in oceans of love

706
02:02:57,045 --> 02:02:59,707
The love which is my lawful
right as his wife...

707
02:03:01,216 --> 02:03:03,377
...I have to beg for,
as his mistress

708
02:03:06,054 --> 02:03:09,387
This is very wrong.
I'll speak to the master

709
02:03:09,557 --> 02:03:11,889
No, Jaisingh.
You mustn't do that

710
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:14,551
I'll be ruined

711
02:03:15,497 --> 02:03:19,729
Whatever little hope I have lost of
winning him back will be lost

712
02:03:21,069 --> 02:03:25,506
Don't ever mention this to anyone.

713
02:03:26,174 --> 02:03:28,165
You must promise me

714
02:03:46,027 --> 02:03:49,360
How are you? You finally found
time to come and see me

715
02:03:49,864 --> 02:03:52,025
How is father?
He is well, isn't he?

716
02:03:52,367 --> 02:03:54,699
- Come in
- Silly girl!

717
02:03:55,036 --> 02:03:56,867
Tell me, how is everyone?

718
02:03:57,038 --> 02:03:59,199
If you keep on chattering,
how do you expect me to reply?

719
02:04:03,545 --> 02:04:06,207
Why are you standing here?
Come inside

720
02:04:08,049 --> 02:04:10,882
Come, sit.
On the chair

721
02:04:13,054 --> 02:04:14,214
Now, tell me

722
02:04:14,489 --> 02:04:18,220
I am on my way to the city
to buy toys. I just dropped by

723
02:04:18,893 --> 02:04:21,555
Your father is much better

724
02:04:22,230 --> 02:04:26,826
Tell me how you've been,
my dear sweet child

725
02:04:27,435 --> 02:04:29,835
You are happy, aren't you?

726
02:04:34,509 --> 02:04:38,172
Yes. I'm very,
very happy, indeed

727
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:40,671
May you be happy, always

728
02:04:43,017 --> 02:04:45,008
Take this

729
02:04:46,521 --> 02:04:49,684
Your father wants me
to take you back with me

730
02:04:50,358 --> 02:04:54,522
I'll fetch you on my way
back home in a couple of days

731
02:04:55,029 --> 02:04:57,520
Ask your husband
if you can go

732
02:04:58,199 --> 02:05:00,690
I must go now.
Or I'll miss my train

733
02:05:24,325 --> 02:05:28,318
- Are you feeling well?
- I didn't sleep too well

734
02:05:29,998 --> 02:05:33,161
- The boss wants to see you
- Come on

735
02:05:43,845 --> 02:05:48,509
Your scheme for repairing the
dam had gone to the Ministry

736
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:51,175
I've received their reply

737
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:54,011
What is it?

738
02:05:54,189 --> 02:05:57,181
They have practically
accepted your scheme

739
02:05:58,026 --> 02:06:00,358
But they want
some clarifications

740
02:06:01,529 --> 02:06:05,522
So I'd like you to go
into town with the files

741
02:06:07,202 --> 02:06:08,863
Into town?

742
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:19,704
My girl! I've spent 3 days
impatiently waiting for you

743
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:26,146
Bless you, uncle. Father
is really much better

744
02:06:27,989 --> 02:06:30,480
I was the cause
of his worries

745
02:06:31,326 --> 02:06:35,490
Now that he has got rid of me,
he is just fine. Isn't it?

746
02:06:35,663 --> 02:06:40,327
Is because I have no one
to look after me

747
02:06:40,835 --> 02:06:42,826
I can't afford to be ill

748
02:06:42,937 --> 02:06:48,170
Enough about me. I'm dying
to hear all about you

749
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:53,504
Don't ask her, but me. I've
seen the luxury she lives in

750
02:06:53,781 --> 02:06:58,844
Didn't I say her husband
would cherish her?

751
02:06:59,354 --> 02:07:02,517
The noise she made!
I won't marry him

752
02:07:03,358 --> 02:07:05,849
I wonder if she even
remembers those days

753
02:07:06,861 --> 02:07:08,852
Of course I do!

754
02:07:10,865 --> 02:07:12,856
How can I ever forget?

755
02:08:19,701 --> 02:08:24,297
What are you doing there
at this hour?

756
02:08:25,807 --> 02:08:28,640
Everything around me
seems to be in darkness

757
02:08:33,147 --> 02:08:35,479
What do you mean?

758
02:08:37,151 --> 02:08:41,315
I must go home
at once, father

759
02:08:43,658 --> 02:08:45,649
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing

760
02:08:46,327 --> 02:08:49,160
I must see my husband
immediately

761
02:08:49,497 --> 02:08:55,333
I want to go home, father.
Please take me home

762
02:09:05,179 --> 02:09:07,340
You've just come
Why the hurry?

763
02:09:08,182 --> 02:09:15,350
Is very urgent. If I don't
go now, it may be too late

764
02:09:16,457 --> 02:09:18,015
When will you be back?

765
02:09:18,192 --> 02:09:21,855
In about 10 days. The meetings
will take some time

766
02:09:28,136 --> 02:09:30,127
Take care, son

767
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,155
You're back?

768
02:09:56,330 --> 02:09:57,319
Where is he?

769
02:09:57,498 --> 02:10:00,490
Did he know you were coming?
He's left

770
02:10:01,169 --> 02:10:03,160
His train is in the evening?

771
02:10:03,337 --> 02:10:07,671
He decided to go by jeep
to get there by nightfall

772
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:14,671
Whas the matter?

773
02:10:18,186 --> 02:10:21,019
Is she not well?
- She was fine a minute ago.

774
02:10:21,189 --> 02:10:25,956
She wanted to see her husband
- Take her inside

775
02:10:39,807 --> 02:10:44,471
Every married couple
quarrels. Am I not right?

776
02:10:44,812 --> 02:10:47,975
Once the child arrives, your
differences will be resolved

777
02:10:49,484 --> 02:10:51,475
Your love will become stronger

778
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:56,814
You mustn't be sad, because
is bad for the child

779
02:10:58,159 --> 02:11:02,653
Rajeev will be back soon.
You'll see how happy he'll be

780
02:11:03,331 --> 02:11:05,322
And affectionate towards you

781
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:11,161
Rajeev Saahib, congratulations.

782
02:11:25,019 --> 02:11:28,011
- Congratulations to you
- To you, too

783
02:11:28,456 --> 02:11:32,187
My scheme has been accepted.
Orders will follow

784
02:11:32,527 --> 02:11:36,190
I'm not congratulating you
for your work

785
02:11:37,365 --> 02:11:41,859
Go home and hear the news
- What news?

786
02:11:42,203 --> 02:11:44,694
I can't tell you. Go home

787
02:11:44,872 --> 02:11:48,205
Your Aunt is waiting.
Don't forget to buy sweets

788
02:11:57,885 --> 02:11:59,216
You're back?

789
02:11:59,554 --> 02:12:03,388
Have you brought sweets?
I want five full kilos

790
02:12:03,891 --> 02:12:07,224
You can have ten.
But tell me why

791
02:12:07,628 --> 02:12:11,724
Well, you're going
to become a father

792
02:12:14,235 --> 02:12:18,399
- A father?
- Yes. Your wife will tell you

793
02:12:30,518 --> 02:12:33,351
Whose child are
you carrying?

794
02:12:34,188 --> 02:12:37,851
Whose bastard do you want
to make me responsible for?

795
02:12:39,026 --> 02:12:41,688
Don't say such things, please

796
02:12:42,697 --> 02:12:45,188
Speak softly.
People will hear you

797
02:12:45,366 --> 02:12:46,856
What are you saying?

798
02:12:46,968 --> 02:12:49,869
This sinful woman
is deceiving me

799
02:12:50,538 --> 02:12:52,529
Who is your secret lover?

800
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:56,376
Can anything be a secret
with so many people around?

801
02:12:56,544 --> 02:12:58,535
Don't intervene, please

802
02:12:59,046 --> 02:13:02,880
I wanted to send her away.
You said she was blameless

803
02:13:03,718 --> 02:13:07,882
But now she is carrying
another man's child

804
02:13:08,389 --> 02:13:12,883
Don't say such things.
I'll tell you everything

805
02:13:13,895 --> 02:13:17,228
The child is yours
- Don't lie

806
02:13:18,399 --> 02:13:21,562
Swear by God and say
that this child is mine

807
02:13:22,503 --> 02:13:25,495
Come here
- Stop. Don't do this

808
02:13:26,173 --> 02:13:31,167
Believe me. Jaisingh,
I take my promises back

809
02:13:31,345 --> 02:13:33,836
Tell him the truth

810
02:13:34,015 --> 02:13:39,351
Listen to me. Is true.
There is only one Rupa

811
02:13:39,854 --> 02:13:42,846
So you say.
But I know another Rupa

812
02:13:43,190 --> 02:13:46,853
I meet her everyday
- That is me.

813
02:13:47,361 --> 02:13:51,024
You meet me everyday

814
02:13:51,933 --> 02:13:55,369
Thas what I'm saying.
She is the one you meet

815
02:13:55,536 --> 02:13:59,529
She is the one you married

816
02:13:59,874 --> 02:14:01,705
You believe they are two woman

817
02:14:01,976 --> 02:14:05,377
You don't know what
you're saying. Move!

818
02:14:06,881 --> 02:14:10,044
Call her father. He said
she was very virtuous

819
02:14:10,551 --> 02:14:12,212
The liar!

820
02:15:37,838 --> 02:15:41,171
The priest said she was
very virtuous. Ask him

821
02:15:41,842 --> 02:15:43,833
Whose child is she carrying?

822
02:15:44,678 --> 02:15:48,842
Have I ever even touched her?

823
02:15:49,183 --> 02:15:53,847
How can she be carrying
my child? Ask your daughter

824
02:15:54,722 --> 02:15:58,681
Ask her who her secret lover is

825
02:15:59,527 --> 02:16:01,188
Look at her!

826
02:16:01,362 --> 02:16:04,695
Even after marrying into such
a good family, she's the same

827
02:16:05,866 --> 02:16:09,358
She was always half-naked
till she got married

828
02:16:10,371 --> 02:16:14,205
Take your daughter with you.
Look after her yourself

829
02:16:14,375 --> 02:16:17,538
Wait. She is not like that.
Have mercy

830
02:16:18,045 --> 02:16:21,879
Wait! Listen!

831
02:16:23,484 --> 02:16:27,147
The child is yours

832
02:16:28,823 --> 02:16:34,159
I swear by God,
this child is yours

833
02:16:35,496 --> 02:16:37,828
- Is true
- I've tolerated enough

834
02:16:42,837 --> 02:16:46,830
But I can't stomach this
filth. Do you understand?

835
02:16:51,178 --> 02:16:53,339
Don't say such things!

836
02:16:54,181 --> 02:16:59,517
For Goïs sake, believe me.

837
02:17:01,021 --> 02:17:03,353
What shall I do?

838
02:17:11,198 --> 02:17:13,189
- Everything will work out
- I told you...

839
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:17,202
...that this wedding
would be a disaster

840
02:17:17,872 --> 02:17:20,705
But you didn't heed me, father

841
02:17:27,148 --> 02:17:30,140
Wake up, father
Don't misunderstand me

842
02:17:44,832 --> 02:17:46,493
Why did it happen?

843
02:19:20,194 --> 02:19:23,129
Why are you here?

844
02:19:23,797 --> 02:19:25,788
I have a question

845
02:19:26,467 --> 02:19:30,631
If I'm a sinner,
then what are you?

846
02:19:32,306 --> 02:19:36,800
You, a married man, you used
to meet your lover at night!

847
02:19:37,811 --> 02:19:39,802
Must I answer at this hour?

848
02:19:40,314 --> 02:19:44,307
Do you want me to ask you in
the morning? For all to hear?

849
02:19:46,153 --> 02:19:47,313
Why put on an act?

850
02:19:47,655 --> 02:19:52,649
You are the one who put on
an act. I just want an answer

851
02:19:54,495 --> 02:19:59,489
If you can give me one
- Yes, I can

852
02:20:01,001 --> 02:20:05,836
I loved Rupa, still love her,
and will always love her

853
02:20:07,174 --> 02:20:09,165
I wanted to tell you, but...

854
02:20:09,510 --> 02:20:13,844
I too wanted to tell you many
things, but did you let me?

855
02:20:14,682 --> 02:20:18,174
Say them now,
I'll let you do so

856
02:20:20,020 --> 02:20:22,011
I have nothing left to tell

857
02:20:22,289 --> 02:20:26,453
No one respects me any more.
Can I win back their respects?

858
02:20:27,461 --> 02:20:31,795
Everyone is slandering me.
Can I stop them doing it?

859
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:37,634
My father couldn't take
the shock. He died

860
02:20:38,806 --> 02:20:41,138
Can I bring him back to life?

861
02:20:42,476 --> 02:20:44,137
What!

862
02:20:45,646 --> 02:20:49,138
Your father? No!

863
02:20:56,323 --> 02:20:58,814
The heart breaks soundlessly,
Babuji

864
02:21:01,161 --> 02:21:05,996
But when it does, the earth
quakes. The heavens open

865
02:21:07,334 --> 02:21:09,325
The world is destroyed

866
02:21:11,505 --> 02:21:13,496
You profess to love truly

867
02:21:14,842 --> 02:21:17,504
If you had tried
to look my way, just once

868
02:21:19,179 --> 02:21:21,511
You would have found
your love in your home

869
02:21:22,683 --> 02:21:24,674
You needn't have gone further

870
02:21:26,687 --> 02:21:30,350
But is of no use now

871
02:21:32,192 --> 02:21:37,357
You caused me to suffer.
You will never be happy, either

872
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:41,691
I'm going

873
02:21:44,538 --> 02:21:47,530
You won't ever find
your wife again

874
02:21:49,710 --> 02:21:51,701
Nor your love

875
02:22:31,185 --> 02:22:33,676
The heart breaks soundlessly,
Babuji

876
02:22:34,354 --> 02:22:39,348
But when it does the earth quakes.
The heavens open

877
02:22:43,864 --> 02:22:46,526
Rain? At this time of the year?

878
02:22:46,867 --> 02:22:49,199
This is no ordinary rain,
Jaisingh

879
02:22:49,369 --> 02:22:51,360
It heralds the coming
of a storm

880
02:23:21,235 --> 02:23:23,169
Is raining

881
02:23:23,837 --> 02:23:26,169
- How are things up there?
- Fine

882
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:28,331
But the level of the water
in the dam is rising

883
02:23:28,509 --> 02:23:30,841
Warn everyone

884
02:23:38,352 --> 02:23:39,512
What is this?

885
02:23:40,521 --> 02:23:42,853
O God, have mercy

886
02:23:43,190 --> 02:23:45,181
Father, come inside

887
02:23:46,527 --> 02:23:49,690
What terrible rain!

888
02:23:50,197 --> 02:23:52,188
Lll stop, father.
You come inside

889
02:23:52,866 --> 02:23:55,858
This is not just rain, son.
It is the wrath of the Gods

890
02:23:57,037 --> 02:24:01,701
It is said that it rains like
this when an angel curses

891
02:24:27,834 --> 02:24:29,825
Where are you, Rupa?

892
02:25:01,101 --> 02:25:03,092
I'm going

893
02:25:05,872 --> 02:25:11,037
You won't ever find your wife
again, nor your love

894
02:25:48,682 --> 02:25:52,846
It looks as if this rain will
never stop. Where is Rajeev?

895
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:55,511
He hasn't come today

896
02:25:56,189 --> 02:25:58,180
He isn't at home either,
since 2 days

897
02:26:09,870 --> 02:26:14,204
Things don't look good.
Such heavy unseasonal rain!

898
02:26:14,541 --> 02:26:18,375
In the catchment area.
10 inches in 16 hours!

899
02:26:18,545 --> 02:26:20,877
If it continues,
there'll be a flood

900
02:26:21,214 --> 02:26:23,148
How high is the dam water?

901
02:26:23,483 --> 02:26:25,644
It was at 571 feet an hour ago

902
02:26:31,825 --> 02:26:35,989
We've just heard that the
dam water might overflow

903
02:26:36,163 --> 02:26:37,824
It will come this way

904
02:26:46,673 --> 02:26:49,335
The water has risen 3.5 feet

905
02:26:49,843 --> 02:26:53,836
The level is rising faster
than we can let it out

906
02:26:54,347 --> 02:26:57,180
I hope the pressure does not
become too much for the dam

907
02:26:57,284 --> 02:26:59,844
Don't even say such things

908
02:27:01,021 --> 02:27:05,355
The dam can't take any
further pressure, sir

909
02:27:05,859 --> 02:27:07,850
Where were you?

910
02:27:08,695 --> 02:27:12,358
Between the storm that is past
and the flood that is to come

911
02:27:14,034 --> 02:27:18,528
The way things are, I think
we should open all the gates

912
02:27:18,805 --> 02:27:23,799
What are you saying! The low
lying areas will get flooded

913
02:27:24,144 --> 02:27:25,475
The crop will be ruined

914
02:27:25,712 --> 02:27:28,306
If we don't
the dam wall is in danger

915
02:27:29,649 --> 02:27:34,313
If it bursts, whole cities
will be swept away

916
02:27:34,488 --> 02:27:36,319
Thousands will die

917
02:27:36,490 --> 02:27:40,153
There will be devastation
such as you can't imagine

918
02:27:40,827 --> 02:27:43,819
Send out a general alarm

919
02:27:46,333 --> 02:27:48,665
And inform people from
the surrounding villages...

920
02:27:49,002 --> 02:27:53,666
...that they should be on
higher ground within 8 hours

921
02:28:01,348 --> 02:28:03,339
Attention...

922
02:28:03,850 --> 02:28:10,847
Men, women, the young, the old
and the children. Each one...

923
02:28:11,358 --> 02:28:15,351
...is asked to flee
to higher grounds

924
02:28:15,862 --> 02:28:19,195
The dam waters will be
released within 8 hours

925
02:28:19,533 --> 02:28:22,468
Let your belongings be.
Save your lives

926
02:28:30,310 --> 02:28:32,642
There is danger
of a great flood

927
02:28:47,828 --> 02:28:50,319
Who is at the starting motor?
Tell him to keep it ready

928
02:28:52,999 --> 02:28:55,661
It takes time to open the
gates. We have none to lose

929
02:28:56,503 --> 02:28:59,495
- The pressure is too great
- Shall we open the gates?

930
02:28:59,673 --> 02:29:04,167
Don't be silly. We can't open
them before the scheduled time

931
02:29:04,344 --> 02:29:07,006
- What shall we do?
- Send six men up

932
02:29:07,514 --> 02:29:09,505
They can open the gates
as soon as they get the signal

933
02:29:42,148 --> 02:29:45,311
Hurry up and come along, son

934
02:29:45,652 --> 02:29:48,314
Les cross the bridge
before nightfall

935
02:30:07,173 --> 02:30:10,006
Looks like
the day of reckoning is here

936
02:30:10,510 --> 02:30:12,501
Have faith in God

937
02:30:15,015 --> 02:30:18,507
No one can extinguish
the Divine Light

938
02:30:20,020 --> 02:30:22,784
Or annihilate those
whom he protects

939
02:30:27,127 --> 02:30:29,118
The final warning has sounded

940
02:30:30,797 --> 02:30:34,289
No, stop this madness and come
with me. He won't come here

941
02:30:38,638 --> 02:30:40,629
Suppose he does?

942
02:30:43,310 --> 02:30:47,303
I can't come with you.
You go ahead

943
02:30:48,148 --> 02:30:51,811
Don't be obstinate.
No one will survive here

944
02:30:52,319 --> 02:30:54,310
I'll be safe, uncle

945
02:30:55,655 --> 02:30:59,648
And even if I'm not, is not
as if I want to live

946
02:31:00,093 --> 02:31:02,653
No, I'm the only one
who wants to live

947
02:31:04,164 --> 02:31:08,328
Thas why I brought you up
Just to leave you here

948
02:31:10,003 --> 02:31:13,336
You may not value the life
of your child

949
02:31:14,841 --> 02:31:16,832
May I not value yours,
either?

950
02:31:18,445 --> 02:31:22,848
You may not want to live, but
will you let your child die?

951
02:31:24,017 --> 02:31:26,008
Should you be ashamed of him?

952
02:31:26,519 --> 02:31:32,355
Don't say such things, uncle

953
02:31:37,197 --> 02:31:41,531
This child is no sin
but a legacy from my marriage

954
02:31:42,702 --> 02:31:44,363
The mark of my true love

955
02:31:44,771 --> 02:31:48,366
Then let us go.
True love can't be destroyed

956
02:31:48,541 --> 02:31:50,532
The truth can't be hidden

957
02:31:51,044 --> 02:31:54,878
Truth is strength

958
02:31:56,216 --> 02:31:59,379
Truth is neither
frightening nor hideous

959
02:31:59,886 --> 02:32:01,877
It is forever pure

960
02:36:50,677 --> 02:36:54,340
I have sinned.
I have sinned terribly

961
02:36:56,516 --> 02:36:58,507
I looked for physical beauty

962
02:36:59,686 --> 02:37:02,678
And I failed to perceive
the beauty of your mind

963
02:37:51,371 --> 02:37:56,673
Cross the bridge quickly

964
02:37:57,343 --> 02:38:00,506
It may collapse
Run!

965
02:44:51,524 --> 02:44:53,515
Are you all right?

966
02:44:59,365 --> 02:45:03,859
I deceived you, didn't I?

967
02:45:06,038 --> 02:45:10,702
Your fairy princess turned out
to be a scarred, ugly girl

968
02:45:12,211 --> 02:45:14,202
Don't

969
02:45:15,381 --> 02:45:19,875
My Rupa is very beautiful.
See her through my eyes

970
02:45:22,321 --> 02:45:24,812
The lamp of her soul
lightens up her face

971
02:45:26,492 --> 02:45:29,655
No one in the world is as
beautiful as her
