1
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:32,028
Two black bean noodles, please!

2
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,070
Hi!

3
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,307
You remember Dorgy?

4
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,371
He was the one
who helped when you moved.

5
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:25,614
Stupid...

6
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,222
He got into a car accident
when he escaped from an inspection.

7
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:32,214
I am in big trouble because of him...

8
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,694
Wait a second.

9
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:37,254
- Are you the factory owner?
- Ah, yes.

10
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,099
May I see his ID card?

11
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,431
Follow me to the office, please.

12
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,811
How much?

13
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:49,496
Please let him on your horse.

14
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:53,333
He has high altitude sickness.

15
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:57,499
Where are you headed?

16
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,404
To Jharkot.

17
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:05,974
Fine.
Put him on the horse.

18
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:39,710
Don't bother the guest.

19
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:46,985
Don't bother the guest.

20
00:26:46,985 --> 00:26:48,077
Okay, mom.

21
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:03,453
You sleep two sun
and two moon.

22
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:09,988
When did Dorgy say
he'll come back?

23
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:26,167
Wait a moment.

24
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:24,063
A gift from your daddy.

25
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:29,031
He is okay.

26
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:39,179
I came here
while travelling on vacation.

27
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:43,445
Papa Dorgy is okay.
He's here on vacation.

28
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:52,528
This money is from Dorgy.

29
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,133
It's money from Papa Dorgy.

30
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:06,157
Didn't Dorgy send a letter?

31
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,468
No letter.

32
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,027
I'm Choi.

33
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:05,870
Choi?

34
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,360
Yes, Choi.

35
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:11,435
I'm Choi.
You?

36
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,703
Is Dorgy really okay?

37
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:17,271
What?

38
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:19,979
I'm worried about him.

39
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:23,285
Oh, Dorgy.

40
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:31,490
Dorgy is okay.
Dorgy is fine.

41
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:49,449
It's dad! He's here!

42
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:48,139
The God Tarat lives beyond
the snow capped mountains.

43
00:43:48,139 --> 00:44:04,181
Long trumpet sounds
can be heard down the mountains.

44
00:44:04,588 --> 00:44:13,496
The gods speak to us
in the winds.

45
00:44:13,698 --> 00:44:29,979
Do good and you will find
water in the wilderness.

46
00:44:32,249 --> 00:44:34,185
Dorgy is your dad, no?

47
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:36,119
Yes, Dorgy is my dad.

48
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:38,883
Then who is he?

49
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,021
He is daddy, too.

50
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:25,094
Hope you stay comfortably here
for as long as you like.

51
00:51:58,228 --> 00:51:59,559
Finished making the rakshi?

52
00:52:00,964 --> 00:52:03,398
Why are you so late?

53
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:05,793
It's okay.
I'll pour her some rakshi.

54
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:37,868
Take care.

55
00:52:37,868 --> 00:52:39,062
Come again.

56
00:53:22,379 --> 00:53:23,311
Go back.

57
00:53:25,148 --> 00:53:27,048
I'm going up the village
to deliver some rakshi.

58
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:30,250
I want to go make a phone call.

59
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:32,256
Let me carry that.

60
00:53:32,256 --> 00:53:33,154
It's okay.

61
00:53:33,724 --> 00:53:35,555
I'll carry it.

62
00:54:14,331 --> 00:54:16,925
May the gods protect us.

63
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:21,770
May the gods protect us.

64
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,334
May the gods protect us.

65
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:31,373
May the gods protect us.

66
00:54:35,786 --> 00:54:37,515
I pray to the gods.

67
00:55:07,884 --> 00:55:11,149
I said I'm in the Himalayas.

68
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:13,545
Nepal.

69
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:22,762
A Nepali worker at my brother's plant
had an accident...

70
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:35,043
Work? Ah...
I'm waiting to be transferred.

71
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:40,847
How's life in the States?

72
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,610
How's our little girl, doing?

73
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:54,327
Okay, I'll call again...

74
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:20,986
Dorgy! Call Dorgy!

75
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:29,723
I don't know his number.

76
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,637
I brought some rakshi.

77
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:14,569
Thank you.

78
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:15,939
Where's the village chief?

79
00:58:15,939 --> 00:58:17,107
In that room.

80
00:58:17,107 --> 00:58:18,008
Which room?

81
00:58:18,008 --> 00:58:18,975
Over there.

82
00:58:35,058 --> 00:58:38,687
A cup of rakshi here, please.

83
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:57,902
Any news on Dorgy?

84
00:59:58,475 --> 01:00:00,170
He's doing well in Korea.

85
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:03,812
Did he make some money?

86
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:06,347
He'll send more, soon.

87
01:00:11,454 --> 01:00:12,689
I'll be going, then.

88
01:00:12,689 --> 01:00:14,156
Take care.

89
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:31,937
Do old men drink like this
in Korea, too?

90
01:00:32,108 --> 01:00:37,546
Can old men like us
get jobs there, too?

91
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:45,522
We're old but we can still work.

92
01:00:45,522 --> 01:00:50,255
Working is the same there, right?

93
01:00:51,161 --> 01:01:01,969
Are there many jobs for
young folks?

94
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:23,360
There's a temple down the mountain.

95
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:30,732
The sound of prayers can be heard.

96
01:01:31,234 --> 01:01:35,271
Souls are carried in the wind.

97
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:40,766
And the wind stops in the gorge.

98
01:08:42,265 --> 01:08:43,857
Where does the wind come from?

99
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:48,532
Over that mountain.
There wind stay

100
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,234
How do you know?

101
01:08:53,409 --> 01:08:55,400
A monk told me.

102
01:08:56,512 --> 01:09:01,609
This wind carries karma
of this life to there.

103
01:09:04,787 --> 01:09:06,618
Karma of this life?

104
01:09:06,956 --> 01:09:14,692
All karma is healed there.
And we can meet our soul.

105
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:15,955
Don't worry.
He'll come back.

106
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:50,356
Mommy!

107
01:22:08,904 --> 01:22:11,634
May the gods please heal him.

108
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:15,308
May the gods please heal him.

109
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:18,939
May the gods please heal him.

110
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:22,481
May the gods please heal him.

111
01:22:23,252 --> 01:22:26,153
Heal him quickly, I pray.

112
01:22:26,922 --> 01:22:30,085
Heal him quickly, I pray.

113
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:33,818
Heal him quickly, I pray....

114
01:23:19,207 --> 01:23:27,046
Wind from east blows
to the north.

115
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:34,584
Strong winds are blowing.

116
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:42,228
Wind makes tears well
in my eyes.

117
01:23:42,764 --> 01:23:58,840
I looked for you in busy city streets,
but found you here in mountains.

118
01:23:59,147 --> 01:24:06,451
We prayed to the gods
and returned to the homeland.

119
01:24:06,655 --> 01:24:13,929
Wind from east blows
to the north.

120
01:24:13,929 --> 01:24:18,100
Strong winds are blowing.

121
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,467
Wind makes tears well
in my eyes.

122
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:28,744
Where fire burns from the ground,
rocks, and water.

123
01:24:28,744 --> 01:24:34,683
Muktinath, the freedom temple
of prayer.

124
01:26:19,287 --> 01:26:23,348
Dorgy's back home.
Thank you

125
01:26:30,665 --> 01:26:33,657
We hope you go back home, safely.
