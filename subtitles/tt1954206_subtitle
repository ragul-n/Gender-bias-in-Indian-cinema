1
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,541
Mother... I've heard that...

2
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:44,947
a beautiful world
exists beyond this village.

3
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:47,248
Big cities, grand markets and...

4
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:50,255
huge houses where movies can be seen.

5
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:27,993
There's nothing of that sort.

6
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:29,220
Now get down.

7
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:32,389
Mother, you always break my dreams.

8
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,296
Dreams are meant to be broken.

9
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,358
Get down.
- No, I won't.

10
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,664
You won't?

11
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,295
What if I make you fall? Tell me.

12
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:41,840
You're my mother. You'll make me fall?

13
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,771
If your mother makes you fall,
she will also help you to your feet.

14
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,245
If you fall in the city,
no one will help you to your feet.

15
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,248
Get down... now!

16
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:51,579
No, I won't.

17
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:53,050
Get down.

18
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:54,620
Mother...

19
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:09,959
When He has blessed you with
one life, why think twice?

20
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:17,698
We barely get down to it...

21
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:19,999
and the bitch next
door is already on a roll!

22
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:27,871
Forget about her, darling.

23
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:30,279
Why don't you soothe
what's excited in here?

24
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:32,112
Get off!

25
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:35,316
Get off!

26
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:39,049
Now go to sleep.
We aren't doing it anymore.

27
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,569
Bloody idiots!

28
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,576
They can't do anything
without making a sound.

29
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:11,647
Marbles, cricket...
the choicest abuses...

30
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:13,487
He even made me wear boy's clothes.

31
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:15,484
If my father had his way...

32
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,722
he would even make me tease girls!

33
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:20,529
Didn't your mother ever stop him?

34
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:24,869
She gave birth to a girl instead of a
boy, so she remained a mute spectator.

35
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,068
Amma, tell me something...

36
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,375
I have what boys desire.

37
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:30,670
So, who is better?

38
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:31,904
Me or a boy?

39
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:35,982
Stop talking nonsense.
It's all rubbish!

40
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:38,983
Now don't be so coy. You're no less.

41
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:42,586
I can tell a lot of men have
been hard at work over here.

42
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:43,815
Stop it!

43
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:56,829
What?

44
00:05:57,904 --> 00:06:00,065
Last night was fun.

45
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,734
Tonight could be even better.

46
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:05,874
My wife has a night-shift...

47
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:07,804
so tonight...

48
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:20,088
I merely touched you and it leaked...

49
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:21,387
your pen!

50
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:23,394
If I come over, what
will become of you?

51
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:24,588
You bitch!

52
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:25,995
My wife is right about you.

53
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:27,828
She is right about you too!

54
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:31,836
You like to go riding but you can
barely stay on for a few seconds.

55
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:54,783
You are mine...

56
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:56,452
so why hide from you...

57
00:06:57,797 --> 00:06:59,458
You can take a peek.

58
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,834
When you will truly be mine,
then you can see the entire picture!

59
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:18,543
You can go in...

60
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:20,747
You can also go in...

61
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:22,682
You are out...

62
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,051
you can go back.

63
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:30,589
Okay, you can go in.

64
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:36,963
You are out.

65
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,529
- Sir... - You can't come in.

66
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:44,303
- The selection is done. - Sir,
sir... I want to be an actor, sir.

67
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,575
And I wanted to be a director.

68
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,347
Sir, I don't want to
dance like other girls.

69
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,917
I want to act, sir.

70
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,509
And I wanted to make offbeat films.

71
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:58,047
Sir, I'll do
anything to become an actor.

72
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:01,693
And to become a director
I could not do anything.

73
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:05,995
Would you like to see
what's not in these pictures?

74
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,694
Do you want to hear
the story of my film?

75
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:13,005
Sir, you aren't even listening to me.

76
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,173
Sir, step out of your film.

77
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,175
And you step out of your dreams.

78
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:19,477
There are 25 like
you waiting outside...

79
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:21,437
and tomorrow there will be 50 more.

80
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,439
You're good for nothing.

81
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,651
Neither do you have the seductive charm
of a lover nor the grace of a wife.

82
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:28,653
You are very dull.

83
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:30,952
I've been living on
sugar for two days...

84
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:32,849
so how can I look spicy?

85
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:36,989
Hold on...

86
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,967
take this and have something to eat.

87
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:45,697
And think about what you
want to do with your life.

88
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:49,236
Not everyone can become an actor.

89
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:03,314
Let's go somewhere else.

90
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,713
Why?

91
00:10:05,785 --> 00:10:09,186
We can be by ourselves
at some late night show.

92
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,955
It will be fun.

93
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:15,159
I'll pay you.

94
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:19,393
How much?

95
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,726
20 rupees.

96
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,766
Only 20 rupees for me?

97
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:29,802
Take it.

98
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,719
Bloody pervert!

99
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,550
You're at the end of your life
and you want a fresh climax?

100
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:11,410
Neither do you have the seductive charm
of a lover nor the grace of a wife.

101
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:13,178
You are very dull.

102
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:17,418
Not everyone can become an actor.

103
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:20,625
There are 25 like
you waiting outside...

104
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:23,018
and tomorrow there will be 50 more.

105
00:11:29,002 --> 00:11:30,663
Just a minute...

106
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:33,536
I'm not dull.

107
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,038
Who are you? What do you want?

108
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,233
Don't you remember?

109
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:38,606
You gave me some money
before rejecting me.

110
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,246
Here's your money.

111
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:44,915
I'm sure I have something for
which that guy forked out 20 rupees.

112
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:47,612
Sudhir, where is that girl?

113
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:49,712
How do I shoot the song sequence?

114
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:53,258
Where do I get a girl who
won't mind ripping her own skin?

115
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:56,687
Your whip scares the girls away...

116
00:11:58,097 --> 00:11:59,223
You want me to do it?

117
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,891
Think you can bear the pain?

118
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,301
I bore it for so long, I'm
sure I can bear it ahead too.

119
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:34,132
Pan the camera.

120
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:48,213
Some say the glass is half full...

121
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:51,214
some say it's half empty.

122
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:53,776
And some are like Silk.

123
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:55,953
They say at least there is a drink.

124
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:57,182
Enjoy it.

125
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,450
It's stupidity.

126
00:12:58,558 --> 00:12:59,889
But often stupidity manages
to get things done that...

127
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,072
Sir...

128
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:23,276
Sir... sir...

129
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,146
You want to take the camera
through the girl? - Do you?

130
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,618
What sort of a shot is this?

131
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,312
You horny bastard, filthy mind...

132
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:31,153
- Sir... - Shut up!

133
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:34,420
You play the flute behind my
back and now you want to sing!

134
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:36,824
Give me that reel.

135
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:38,562
Please sit, sir...

136
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,598
I left the shot for one
day and see what happened.

137
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,928
Where is it? Stop it!

138
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:43,365
Sir, we'll cut it, please...

139
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:46,404
If you don't cut the reel,
I'll cut you somewhere...

140
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:48,565
and then you won't know
whether to wear trousers or skirts!

141
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,525
What's the occasion, Amma?
You're all dressed to kill.

142
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:13,565
Who is the poor guy?

143
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,430
Check out the newspaper,
your movie is out today.

144
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:18,026
Aren't we going for
'first day, first show'?

145
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:19,263
Look...

146
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,304
Amma...

147
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,308
wait here, I'll just get ready.

148
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,774
Everybody should know that...

149
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,543
every film has only one hero...

150
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,146
Director!

151
00:14:33,452 --> 00:14:35,443
Every film one hero...

152
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:36,881
Who?

153
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:39,621
Director!

154
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,224
Everybody is staring at you.

155
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:51,894
Who is that?
- The director.

156
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,631
Oh...
- Come on!

157
00:14:58,277 --> 00:15:00,643
Take off your sunglasses.

158
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,342
Where is our seat?

159
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:07,041
Amma, we'll watch my
first film from up close.

160
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:08,882
You mean it's the first row?

161
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:10,046
Here it is.

162
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:11,646
No, here.

163
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:20,422
- Wow, it's Selva
Ganesh's film. - Yes!

164
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:21,932
His films are entertaining.

165
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:24,697
Off with your sunglasses.

166
00:15:26,272 --> 00:15:27,603
- Amma... - Yes?

167
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:30,676
Mark my words, now all
my problems will go away.

168
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:33,138
The dance director said
he liked my performance.

169
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,440
Really?

170
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:36,675
Another thing, Amma...

171
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:39,751
My life has moved from
'pack up' to 'action'.

172
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:41,252
Now I won't let it slip away.

173
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:42,616
Hey! Shhh!

174
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,082
Stop talking.

175
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,316
What do you mean 'shhh'?

176
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:46,686
She is the heroine.

177
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:48,690
She is the heroine?

178
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:51,390
The heroine?

179
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:54,562
If she is the heroine,
can I get a refund?

180
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,336
Is this your song?

181
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:03,801
No.

182
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:10,742
This one?

183
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:23,288
Probably this is your song.

184
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:24,863
No...

185
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:26,226
Where is it?

186
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,065
Where is your song?

187
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:15,139
Miss Heroine...

188
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:16,373
heroine...

189
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:17,779
Can I at least have your autograph?

190
00:17:17,883 --> 00:17:19,350
What has she done?

191
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:22,119
She's there in the whole film.

192
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:24,655
Reshma...

193
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:27,123
Madam... can I have your autograph?

194
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:30,153
People in Hollywood are
probably wondering...

195
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:31,719
...why I am wasting my talent in India.

196
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:34,425
I wish you had left for Hollywood
before putting me into a loss.

197
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,761
I would have been better off.

198
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:38,667
Sir, you haven't
tasted real respect yet.

199
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,568
Nayla has written
such a fantastic review.

200
00:17:40,673 --> 00:17:43,267
Look at the wonderful
things that have been printed.

201
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:46,701
Hey... You english show-off!

202
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:50,077
I would've been happy if at
least the tickets were sold.

203
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:51,342
Sir, you wait and watch...

204
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,418
because of this film, you
will have a trophy in your hand.

205
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,749
And a begging bowl in the other.

206
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:59,413
Nowhere in the film did
the 'hero reason' come alive.

207
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:00,685
Not 'hero reason'.

208
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,153
It's heroism.

209
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:04,519
If you know it, why
didn't you portray it?

210
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,329
Sir, the thing is...

211
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:10,061
one man thrashing a dozen bad guys and
a dozen hot girls falling for one man...

212
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,727
doesn't click with the audience.

213
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:14,635
Real films are those that
compel the audience to think.

214
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,401
The audience wants to
feel something else...

215
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:17,908
and you want them to feel their mind?

216
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:19,903
Sir...

217
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,012
Abraham sir deleted one song.

218
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:25,345
That song would have worked wonders.

219
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:26,577
Which song?

220
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:27,982
This one... take a look.

221
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:29,918
Let me watch it.

222
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:47,369
Dear friend...

223
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:49,101
you should go to Hollywood.

224
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:52,869
We will miss you but you should go.

225
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,269
You robbed the film of its life!

226
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:56,607
Life?

227
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:58,411
You mean... that fatso...

228
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:00,007
I will add this song as
a special feature and...

229
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:02,813
release the film
again in smaller towns.

230
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:04,514
That will definitely
recover some money.

231
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:10,621
Abraham, what are you doing?

232
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:11,821
Abraham...

233
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,023
what are you doing?

234
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:14,224
What did you do that for?

235
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,362
You've set the positive on fire.

236
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,537
I still have the negative.

237
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:27,974
Mark my words, this girl
will set the screen on fire!

238
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,566
Hey, What are you doing?

239
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:50,760
I'm taking a picture.

240
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,430
You can't do that, get out!

241
00:19:58,577 --> 00:19:59,703
Ticket, ticket...

242
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:00,972
Blackie!

243
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,173
Blackie... listen...

244
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:04,647
I want a ticket.

245
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,944
Not you again!

246
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:08,877
The amount you have spent
on watching this film...

247
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:10,922
would have got you the girl.

248
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,726
- Are you serious? - Of course!

249
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:21,931
Selva Ganesh has
proved once again that...

250
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:25,459
he will go to any
length to make money.

251
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:27,972
This is not a film,
it's a volley of abuses.

252
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:34,243
This is the respect that I like.

253
00:20:34,346 --> 00:20:39,079
The more these critics pan my film,
the more my film will earn for me.

254
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,412
Well done, Vimal. Good job.

255
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,714
Thank you, sir.

256
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:44,455
I want this girl.

257
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,820
If merely her glimpse can
arouse the crowd to this extent...

258
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:49,986
imagine what will happen if
she danced to an entire song!

259
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:51,221
Get her.

260
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,992
But sir, I don't know who
she is or where she came from.

261
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:55,259
Well then, find out.

262
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,698
I'm sure someone knows.

263
00:20:56,969 --> 00:20:59,130
If she is present in the song, surely
she hasn't appeared out of thin air.

264
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:00,330
Find her!

265
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:01,531
Yes, sir.

266
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:05,903
This girl will be my
biggest discovery.

267
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:05,033
Who is it?

268
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:10,342
What is it?

269
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:12,108
G... G... G...

270
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:13,838
G... G... what? Who are you?

271
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:15,106
I... I... I...

272
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:16,909
What do you want?

273
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:21,576
Money!

274
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:24,254
What's this?

275
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:27,291
That's one less than hundred.

276
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,225
Why?

277
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:32,092
I bought this for one rupee.

278
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,463
Are you high?
Should I bring you back to reality?

279
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:37,796
Forgot everything?

280
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:39,302
Film... I saw your film.

281
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:43,571
Ever since then
I've been saving up for you.

282
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,066
You are lying!

283
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:47,577
I haven't acted in any film.

284
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,375
Go away from here...

285
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:50,971
get lost!

286
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:04,689
The middle word in life is... 'if'.

287
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:06,196
The big 'if'!

288
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:09,165
If only that bastard Selva Ganesh
had spent five more minutes...

289
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:10,599
...in the bathroom...

290
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:14,332
if only he had driven 5 kmph slower...

291
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,670
everybody's life would
have remained the same.

292
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:17,901
But no.

293
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,071
He was eager to screw me and how!

294
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:25,241
Even sitting on a
couch didn't feel safe.

295
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:28,684
The sun arose that morning
to shine bright on Reshma...

296
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:31,316
and to burn me to ashes.

297
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:35,488
Baby, should I call for more?

298
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:38,556
Enough, Amma.

299
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:43,089
Baby, all the people who've had
breakfast with me in the past...

300
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:45,693
today enjoy dinner at 5-star hotels.

301
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:50,666
Join hands with me and the world
will praise you with hands joined.

302
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:52,677
Have some more... keep eating.

303
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:55,436
And you will be the best.

304
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:57,947
I can see it, you have that...

305
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,177
desire.

306
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:22,304
Silk!

307
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,209
Today onwards your name is Silk.

308
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:29,405
And your name is Mr. Worm.

309
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:31,042
What?

310
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:34,244
Silk is created by worms.

311
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:41,017
Baby, whether I'm
Selva Ganesh or Mr. Worm...

312
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,751
but all I am is an
opportunity for you.

313
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:46,857
And this opportunity
won't come by again...

314
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:50,401
it will only go to someone else.

315
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:48,552
Okay, sir...

316
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,820
music...

317
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:53,963
One, two, three, four...

318
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,472
Silk, no heat...

319
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,881
no heat!

320
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:15,317
We want to titillate the public...

321
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:17,518
not put them to sleep.

322
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:19,989
And sir, extraordinary shot.

323
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:21,286
Sir, extraordinary...

324
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:23,623
but one more, sir, please.

325
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,161
Cut it!

326
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:34,864
Silk, what are you doing?

327
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,272
Imagine Surya sir is
a log of sandalwood.

328
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:38,707
And you are a serpent...

329
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:40,210
wrap yourself around him.

330
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:41,904
And Surya sir, very good shot.

331
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:44,175
But she's a newcomer, sir.
One more shot, sir, please.

332
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:10,438
George...

333
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,841
Surya gives only one take. That's it.

334
00:27:13,946 --> 00:27:15,641
Here I am...

335
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:16,907
Sir, please, sir...

336
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:20,041
A day with Surya is worth
a hundred thousand rupees!

337
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:21,278
Understand?

338
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:25,949
A good looking fruit
isn't always sweet!

339
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:27,650
Set up my solo shot.

340
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,704
Hey you...

341
00:27:48,213 --> 00:27:49,373
come here.

342
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:56,514
What's your name?

343
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,351
Reshma...

344
00:27:58,457 --> 00:27:59,583
Silk.

345
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:04,193
Two names to go by and you
can't do one silly step.

346
00:28:06,164 --> 00:28:07,392
See this...

347
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:12,964
plastic cover?

348
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:16,773
Whether it's there or not...

349
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:20,674
it makes no
difference to the cigarette.

350
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:24,278
Similarly...

351
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:28,285
whether you are in this film or not...
it makes no difference to anyone.

352
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:34,157
You know something...

353
00:28:34,226 --> 00:28:38,356
if there's no cover and it rains...

354
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:41,457
the cigarette won't even light up.

355
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:46,000
Pack up!

356
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:50,373
Heroine says that it's going to rain.

357
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,441
I've been hit by a
shoe because of you.

358
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,016
But I won't let it happen again.

359
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:00,846
You made Surya sir very angry.

360
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:02,412
You go!

361
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:04,686
And don't ever come back.

362
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:18,625
What are you doing in here?

363
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:22,971
I'm here to get tuned, and
then we can make some music.

364
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:26,777
You switched your
melody pretty quickly.

365
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:30,346
It's your personality, sir.

366
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,341
I've been admiring you
since I was a little girl.

367
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:37,911
I was scared to be next to you.

368
00:29:38,957 --> 00:29:41,926
Now that's believable.

369
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:45,920
If God puts in an appearance...

370
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:48,861
the devotee is bound to be scared.

371
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:52,130
Sir, please give me another chance.

372
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:54,235
Why should I?

373
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:56,204
I'll be devoted to you.

374
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:59,134
I'll do anything you want me to.

375
00:30:01,947 --> 00:30:04,609
Don't you read the magazines?

376
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:10,214
The magazines say that...

377
00:30:10,322 --> 00:30:14,759
I've tuned 500 girls.

378
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:26,103
But have you ever
tuned one girl 500 times?

379
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:36,347
- Is it true about the 500... - No...

380
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,812
501!

381
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:55,933
Sir, Surya won't act with her.

382
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:57,866
Sir, there they come.

383
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:06,671
I guess Surya sir is all charged up.

384
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:12,378
Suryakant may die but he
won't let go of a new girl.

385
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:22,188
Cut...

386
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:23,454
What?

387
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:28,965
She's doing it all wrong again,
she missed a beat.

388
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:34,629
To hell with the beat,
look at that heat...

389
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:36,434
she'll set everyone on fire.

390
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,023
Extraordinary, sir, very good, sir.

391
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,861
Mind-blowing, sir,
very good shot, sir.

392
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:17,904
Madam...

393
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:19,615
ticket please.

394
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:23,443
That's your seat, sit there.

395
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,455
How does it matter?
This place is empty.

396
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:26,717
I don't want problems later.

397
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,816
Go and sit according to your ticket.

398
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:15,459
Mother...

399
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:18,035
congratulate me.

400
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:21,299
Your son has stood first in college.

401
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:22,668
Bless you, my dear.

402
00:34:22,774 --> 00:34:25,743
You've fulfilled all my wishes.

403
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:28,005
If only your dad were alive today...

404
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:34,376
Cut it!

405
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:35,919
Very good shot, Surya sir.

406
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:38,211
Excellent shot.

407
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,881
Just like a young boy.

408
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:42,620
That was... that was very good.

409
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:45,924
You are very convincing as my mother.

410
00:34:52,337 --> 00:34:54,202
Naylaji!

411
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:57,207
What a pleasure, what brings you here?

412
00:34:58,009 --> 00:35:00,773
Last month's
magazine hasn't sold well?

413
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:03,146
Probably because you
didn't grace the cover!

414
00:35:03,882 --> 00:35:08,342
So what's brewing... under cover?

415
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:16,291
This is new!

416
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:20,629
Lalitha was the heroine in your
last film and both of you were hot.

417
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:23,599
And now she is playing your mother?

418
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:25,032
You see...

419
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,094
youth is meant to be tasted...

420
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,968
not wasted!

421
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,865
A heroine's life...

422
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:34,507
is like an elected government.

423
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:36,805
The party lasts for five years...

424
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:38,178
after that it's there for support.

425
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:40,979
Sometimes left... sometimes right...

426
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:43,883
and sometimes even centre!

427
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:50,953
I've heard that new girl, Silk, is a
passionate supporter of your party.

428
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,997
Everybody is talking about her.

429
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:57,826
Of course, I gave her a break.

430
00:35:57,936 --> 00:35:59,699
She is very talented.

431
00:36:00,872 --> 00:36:06,936
When God has blessed
her so abundantly...

432
00:36:07,045 --> 00:36:09,206
there's no harm in
taking a piece of the pie.

433
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:10,747
Right?

434
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,578
You know me...

435
00:36:12,684 --> 00:36:19,522
I believe the more I can be of
help to others, the better it is.

436
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:22,318
But she is a quite down market.

437
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:23,951
You write up on her was perfect.

438
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:26,053
Well, I have to, Surya sir.

439
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:29,395
To portray men as saints...

440
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:32,227
women have to be depicted as demons.

441
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,032
Sir, madam is here.

442
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:35,699
Yes.

443
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,301
See you later.

444
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:40,536
What about my interview?

445
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:42,579
We'll do it later.

446
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:45,672
This is important.

447
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:48,949
Quick, some filter coffee for madam.

448
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:53,585
Is Silk here?

449
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,961
The cinema hall was filled with men...

450
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:05,763
every one of them only to see me.

451
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:09,102
And as soon as the
song was over, they left.

452
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:10,640
It was amazing.

453
00:37:12,377 --> 00:37:14,868
Don't be so excited.

454
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:19,746
Take a look at what
Nayla has to say about you.

455
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:20,977
Who is Nayla?

456
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:24,020
The most important film
critic and gossip queen.

457
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:28,956
When she writes,
everybody pays attention.

458
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:36,727
She says Selva took the
help of dirt to sell his film.

459
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,903
Dirt...

460
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:41,198
that's you.

461
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:45,666
Look at my picture, it's so gorgeous.

462
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:47,740
Now, I will stop at nothing.

463
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:50,339
Help me with more work...

464
00:37:51,015 --> 00:37:55,315
But why should I help you?

465
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:59,814
Because I love you and...

466
00:38:02,126 --> 00:38:06,187
we still have 499 times
remaining to get tuned.

467
00:38:10,268 --> 00:38:11,826
Come in...

468
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:19,236
So, Akbar and Anarkali
are on talking terms?

469
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:21,278
Sir, good sense of humour, sir.

470
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:22,904
Abraham, this is Silk.

471
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:24,106
Hello.

472
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:27,742
Surya sir, I want to talk
to you about my next film.

473
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,082
And this film will showcase you.

474
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:33,646
You won't need a cheap and
disgusting act to promote this film.

475
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:45,467
Abraham, everybody
knows you make good films.

476
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,832
Thank you, sir.

477
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,133
I owe it all to idli, rasam and rum.

478
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:53,101
But your films aren't...

479
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:56,476
commercially successful.

480
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:01,346
They captivate the
audience at film festivals but...

481
00:39:01,452 --> 00:39:03,716
they fail to bring in even
a dog at local theatres.

482
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,015
Is that right?

483
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:06,420
Right, sir.

484
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:10,484
Spice it up, Abraham, spice it up.

485
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:12,324
Add some sex.

486
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:15,691
Have Silk dance to a number
or two, whatever you like.

487
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,994
Let me tell you...

488
00:39:17,568 --> 00:39:20,093
successful films are those that...

489
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:22,202
have the right spice.

490
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:23,432
Right, Selva?

491
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,532
You are genius, sir.

492
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:29,171
It's a curse, Selva. It's a curse.

493
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:31,408
Sir, I'm a director, not a pimp.

494
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,578
I want to make a film, not sell sex.

495
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:38,613
Perhaps you can work with
that cheap girl but I can't!

496
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:42,792
Right.

497
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:45,420
Fine, Selva you direct it.

498
00:39:47,498 --> 00:39:49,295
Okay, sir.

499
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:51,866
Then bye.

500
00:39:54,072 --> 00:39:57,508
I wasn't dejected that
they chose Silk over me...

501
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:03,006
I was dejected that
they decided so quickly.

502
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:05,512
Why do you have a problem with me?

503
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:11,587
I have a problem with your parents.

504
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:14,284
They shouldn't have
given birth to you.

505
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:18,719
My parents didn't give birth to me.

506
00:40:19,797 --> 00:40:22,630
Silk was brought into this world...

507
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,035
by the people who admire me.

508
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:33,075
Your admirers occupy the
first four rows in a cinema hall.

509
00:40:33,544 --> 00:40:35,535
The 40 rows at the back are mine.

510
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:40,381
I will prove that films don't
need gimmicks like you to sell.

511
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:44,987
Films need three things to sell...

512
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:49,250
entertainment,
entertainment, entertainment!

513
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:52,688
And I am entertainment.

514
00:40:57,602 --> 00:41:00,400
A woman is like a rainbow.

515
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:02,800
As many faces as the colors.

516
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:06,068
Some consider her a lottery.

517
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:09,646
If you win, you've hit the jackpot!

518
00:41:10,648 --> 00:41:12,843
Some think of her as love.

519
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:14,648
If you fall in love with her...

520
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,276
you will gasp for every breath!

521
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:19,913
But she ravaged me like poison.

522
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:24,724
That now even water
burns me up from inside!

523
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:54,483
Your sweet torment

524
00:41:54,592 --> 00:41:56,492
surreptitious torment

525
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:58,721
Here and around

526
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,195
I am angry

527
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:02,027
you are the reason

528
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:06,593
Cajole me my love

529
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:09,639
I will tease you

530
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,868
you are a bombastic girl

531
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:14,468
Aha Aha Aha

532
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:18,310
Ooh la la, Ooh la la,
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

533
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:22,045
You are my fantasy

534
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:25,850
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

535
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:29,017
I am a young lady now

536
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:33,623
Ooh la la, Ooh la la,
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

537
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:36,700
You are my fantasy

538
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:41,169
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

539
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:44,469
I am a young lady now

540
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:12,130
When touched

541
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:13,396
by you

542
00:43:13,504 --> 00:43:15,199
my heart whistled

543
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:19,039
Give me a sweet kiss on my cheeks

544
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,078
When touched by you

545
00:43:21,178 --> 00:43:22,668
my heart whistled

546
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:26,648
Give me a sweet kiss on my cheeks

547
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:30,448
Your youth, is fluid

548
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:33,785
which has drenched my heart

549
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:36,190
Aha you brought the rain

550
00:43:36,294 --> 00:43:40,230
what could my poor youth do?

551
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:44,165
Ooh la la, Ooh la la,
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

552
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:46,736
You are my fantasy

553
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:47,997
No no no no no

554
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:51,632
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

555
00:43:51,742 --> 00:43:55,803
I am a young lady now

556
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:13,593
By dropping your saree

557
00:44:13,698 --> 00:44:17,794
repeatedly

558
00:44:17,902 --> 00:44:24,808
you make me restless

559
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:28,801
By dropping your saree

560
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:33,316
repeatedly

561
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:39,287
you make me restless

562
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:42,988
After storming a fire in me

563
00:44:43,094 --> 00:44:46,029
what can the poor saree do

564
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:48,031
Poor thing

565
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:50,498
Oh poor thing

566
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:53,594
I will tease you

567
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:56,867
you are a bombastic girl

568
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:58,168
Oh no

569
00:44:58,275 --> 00:45:02,234
Ooh la la, Ooh la la,
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

570
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:04,906
You are my fantasy

571
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:06,142
Ah ah

572
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,845
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

573
00:45:09,954 --> 00:45:11,922
I am a young lady now

574
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:13,718
Hey hey hey hey

575
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:17,555
Ooh la la, Ooh la la,
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

576
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:20,119
You are my fantasy

577
00:45:20,231 --> 00:45:21,391
Oh oh

578
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:25,333
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

579
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:29,237
I am a young lady now

580
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:32,105
You want to interview me?

581
00:45:33,878 --> 00:45:35,209
At my place?

582
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:37,981
This evening... great!

583
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,384
- Amma... - What is it?

584
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:42,975
It was a call from Manorama magazine.

585
00:45:43,054 --> 00:45:44,715
They want to interview me.

586
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:47,781
They want to show the
world how stars live.

587
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:49,689
No film star lives like you do.

588
00:45:49,794 --> 00:45:51,227
Refuse them.

589
00:45:51,295 --> 00:45:53,661
Amma, these opportunities
don't come by again and again...

590
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:55,425
they will only pass
on to someone else.

591
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,197
What will you show?

592
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:58,632
The tiny room you live in?

593
00:46:04,975 --> 00:46:08,103
I brought this deer from Africa.

594
00:46:08,212 --> 00:46:09,440
Superb, sir.

595
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:13,881
This gun is an antique from Bulgaria.

596
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:21,986
Sir, deep breath, stomach in.

597
00:46:26,831 --> 00:46:30,096
Click my picture...

598
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:33,796
Click my picture...

599
00:46:33,904 --> 00:46:36,236
Go away... get lost!

600
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:42,341
Oops... you're early.

601
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:43,674
Ma'am...

602
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:45,112
I can come back later.

603
00:46:45,216 --> 00:46:47,446
Now that you are here,
let's begin the interview.

604
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,746
You mean like this?

605
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:52,379
But have you worn something?

606
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:57,325
Do you bathe with your clothes on?

607
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,421
No.

608
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:00,862
Exactly!

609
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:03,362
Having a bath with your
clothes on is cheating...

610
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,768
and Silk doesn't cheat.

611
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,431
What you see is what you get!

612
00:47:20,751 --> 00:47:22,184
What are you doing?

613
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:24,345
You are only taking my pictures

614
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:25,786
What about my house?

615
00:47:25,856 --> 00:47:28,222
When the goddess is
present in her full glory...

616
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:30,919
who cares about the temple?

617
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:50,113
Thanks to Silk I was out of work.

618
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:53,043
All day and night
she danced in my mind.

619
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:56,677
But she didn't care a
damn about these things.

620
00:47:56,954 --> 00:47:59,149
She was running in a race...

621
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:01,687
where you must look straight ahead.

622
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,093
Sir...

623
00:48:04,195 --> 00:48:07,426
Silk is very good at
creating headlines.

624
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:10,027
But this isn't right, sir.

625
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:12,733
A girl, that too an actress...

626
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:14,395
moreover on the front page!

627
00:48:15,005 --> 00:48:16,233
Bad news, sir.

628
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,103
She's flying high.

629
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:21,333
Let her.

630
00:48:21,946 --> 00:48:24,141
No matter how high the popcorn goes...

631
00:48:24,515 --> 00:48:27,450
it always falls back in the pan.

632
00:48:28,152 --> 00:48:30,450
Excellent, sir, excellent!

633
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:33,182
That's brilliant!

634
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:36,418
What are you looking for?

635
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:41,494
Someone from Manorama
had interviewed me too...

636
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,799
but those idiots
didn't print anything!

637
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:53,367
When will you grow up?

638
00:48:53,444 --> 00:48:55,207
You brought all this
to your new house too!

639
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:57,874
What if Surya sees it?

640
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:00,149
He will be pleased
that before I met him...

641
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:03,220
I would make do with his pictures.

642
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:05,852
Surya and you are worlds apart.

643
00:49:06,123 --> 00:49:07,351
I'm worried.

644
00:49:07,458 --> 00:49:09,688
A thousand girls like
you are crazy for him.

645
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:13,129
And a thousand guys
like him are crazy for me.

646
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,322
What's to worry?

647
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:16,228
We have the world at our feet.

648
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:19,367
He has another life...

649
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,835
he is married.

650
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:25,064
If I had met him earlier,
perhaps he would have married me...

651
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:26,938
and I would've been his wife's place.

652
00:49:27,778 --> 00:49:30,611
'Lf', 'perhaps', 'I would've been'...

653
00:49:30,848 --> 00:49:34,909
when these words crop up in love,
it's better to step back.

654
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:39,316
Amma, I know I don't
have any right on Surya.

655
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:41,249
But what can I do?

656
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:43,053
There are no brakes in love.

657
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:44,958
Let's talk about something else, Amma.

658
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:47,462
You know something, sit...

659
00:49:47,564 --> 00:49:48,826
do you hear that?

660
00:49:48,932 --> 00:49:50,661
What?
- Listen carefully.

661
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:55,335
I don't hear anything.

662
00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:56,839
Precisely! That's the
best part of living here.

663
00:49:57,408 --> 00:50:00,707
You don't hear the
neighbours and no unwanted sounds.

664
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:21,930
Silk, make it more seductive.

665
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,708
This scene should
make the public go wild.

666
00:50:35,813 --> 00:50:36,939
Make it hot.

667
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:40,310
Leave me!

668
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:41,679
Darling.

669
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:47,117
Darling.

670
00:50:52,096 --> 00:50:54,758
Mr. Worm, take your shot.

671
00:51:53,657 --> 00:51:55,318
That was fantastic.

672
00:51:55,426 --> 00:51:57,360
What a shot!

673
00:51:58,095 --> 00:52:00,290
Very good, very good...

674
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:06,164
So Silk...

675
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:08,837
were you thinking about Surya sir?

676
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:15,602
Why think about someone, with
whom I can be whenever I want to!

677
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:24,182
Ratnamma, I have
dialogues in this film.

678
00:52:24,988 --> 00:52:26,546
I'm very nervous.

679
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:28,056
Why?

680
00:52:28,826 --> 00:52:30,350
People will laugh at me.

681
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:34,392
Why did the Worm
have to have a premiere?

682
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:36,555
I won't attend the premiere.

683
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:37,793
Why not?

684
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:39,493
Ratnamma, I'm a dancer.

685
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,295
I don't even have the
'ting' of acting in me.

686
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:45,167
You listen to me
nothing will happen...

687
00:52:45,242 --> 00:52:46,903
I know her... listen to me.

688
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,773
Let me at least talk to her.

689
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:51,074
- Silk madam... - You can't go in.

690
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:53,878
Ratnamma... I'll call you later.

691
00:52:55,719 --> 00:52:57,050
Just let me talk to her!

692
00:52:57,154 --> 00:52:58,485
Silk madam... Silk madam!

693
00:53:00,157 --> 00:53:01,624
Madam...

694
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:04,455
how are you, madam?

695
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,897
You!

696
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:13,659
Silk madam... how are you?

697
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:14,965
I'm good.

698
00:53:15,072 --> 00:53:17,734
God is playing games with me.

699
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:19,908
I thought...

700
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:23,645
a thousand rupees
might be enough but...

701
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:26,948
you... you seem to be... very rich.

702
00:53:29,152 --> 00:53:31,052
Even a million won't be enough.

703
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:36,585
You know something...

704
00:53:37,394 --> 00:53:38,622
you've been lucky for me.

705
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:41,627
Every time you appear...

706
00:53:41,865 --> 00:53:43,298
something good definitely happens.

707
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:53,605
Now you're leaving me high and dry.

708
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:56,076
I'm giving the security
guard a thousand for the kiss.

709
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:57,339
Thanks a lot, madam.

710
00:53:57,447 --> 00:54:00,939
You are very nice.

711
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:09,253
Some people make
films touch the heart.

712
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,089
Some people make films touch the mind.

713
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:15,563
The body part they wanted to touch...

714
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,497
well, this film was a hit there!

715
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:28,777
Thank you...

716
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:33,077
- Very nice. - You liked it?

717
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,617
What a film, what a film!

718
00:54:34,718 --> 00:54:35,912
You liked it?

719
00:54:35,986 --> 00:54:37,146
Like?

720
00:54:38,188 --> 00:54:41,055
I haven't seen such a
disgusting film in my life.

721
00:54:42,593 --> 00:54:43,821
There's something nice
and superb about this film.

722
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:45,326
Silk?

723
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:51,158
Now you will realise that to make a
good film you need a good director...

724
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:52,762
not a dancer!

725
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:54,129
But don't you worry.

726
00:54:54,204 --> 00:54:55,330
You think this film will do well?

727
00:54:55,973 --> 00:54:57,201
Not a chance.

728
00:54:57,975 --> 00:55:01,604
But I am still
willing to work with you...

729
00:55:02,379 --> 00:55:04,438
because you gave me my first break.

730
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:07,242
Here...

731
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:08,782
have this and...

732
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,883
even the abuses will sound sweet.

733
00:55:14,992 --> 00:55:16,960
Mr. Worm!

734
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:21,828
That bastard ripped everything apart!

735
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:23,689
Forget about him.

736
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,064
I am sure even his
alcohol is as bad as him.

737
00:55:26,503 --> 00:55:27,834
But...

738
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:30,236
what if his words come true?

739
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:34,236
We haven't made this film for him.

740
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:37,814
Our fate will be decided on Friday.

741
00:56:02,506 --> 00:56:06,033
Industry has sunk to new lows...

742
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,571
thanks to Selva Ganesh and...

743
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:11,546
more importantly Silk.

744
00:56:11,648 --> 00:56:13,445
By Nayla.

745
00:56:25,395 --> 00:56:28,887
Down with Silk!

746
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,366
Down with Silk!

747
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:02,523
Hello Silk...

748
00:57:03,266 --> 00:57:04,927
It's been so long.

749
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:06,627
Is this the first time you're here?

750
00:57:07,771 --> 00:57:10,797
You act very well even in reality!

751
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:12,898
Sir, a little closer, please.

752
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:16,140
Yes, that's fine.

753
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,740
Let's go inside.

754
00:57:17,848 --> 00:57:19,873
The action always takes place inside.

755
00:57:22,219 --> 00:57:24,847
All night you stick to me like glue...

756
00:57:24,955 --> 00:57:26,582
otherwise you don't
even want to hold me.

757
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:28,483
Hello...

758
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:30,219
Control yourself, Silk.

759
00:57:30,293 --> 00:57:31,726
The people here know me.

760
00:57:31,795 --> 00:57:34,093
If my wife hears about this,
it won't be good.

761
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:37,327
See you later at the farmhouse.

762
00:57:37,434 --> 00:57:38,662
So, now what?

763
00:57:41,438 --> 00:57:43,838
Enjoy the race.

764
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,033
Lay a bet on a good horse.

765
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,471
I've bet on you.

766
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:51,775
Don't let me down.

767
00:57:51,882 --> 00:57:53,509
Evening... farmhouse.

768
00:57:55,185 --> 00:57:56,413
That's Silk.

769
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,078
What is she doing here?

770
00:57:58,188 --> 00:58:00,213
Are people like her allowed in here?

771
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:04,259
Let alone her films, I
don't even look at the posters!

772
00:58:08,331 --> 00:58:09,559
You!

773
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:12,398
You are... here at the race course...

774
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:13,594
Why not?

775
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:15,034
Can't I come to the race course?

776
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:16,662
I'm a star too.

777
00:58:16,773 --> 00:58:19,606
You think only these well
dressed people with their English...

778
00:58:19,676 --> 00:58:21,268
...accents can come here?

779
00:58:21,745 --> 00:58:23,042
You are Silk, aren't you?

780
00:58:23,146 --> 00:58:24,613
Yes, so what?

781
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:26,248
I am your fan.

782
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,953
I didn't think
anybody here would know me.

783
00:58:33,056 --> 00:58:36,355
Apart from a dozen
horses and a few asses...

784
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:38,689
there's no one here
who doesn't know you.

785
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:42,760
Thank you.

786
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:54,673
I want to lay a wager
that number 9 will win.

787
00:58:54,778 --> 00:58:56,040
How do I do it?

788
00:58:56,146 --> 00:58:58,944
Silk madam, don't bet on that horse.

789
00:58:59,049 --> 00:59:00,448
This horse has never won.

790
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,040
Nobody has ever bet on him.

791
00:59:02,152 --> 00:59:04,177
Did anyone imagine that India
would defeat West Indies...

792
00:59:04,254 --> 00:59:06,017
...in the cricket world cup final?

793
00:59:06,122 --> 00:59:07,214
But India won!

794
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,656
If nobody bets on him,
why will he win?

795
00:59:09,759 --> 00:59:11,659
He's a horse, not an ass.

796
00:59:11,761 --> 00:59:12,989
Here's the money.

797
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:17,697
It will.

798
00:59:21,104 --> 00:59:22,435
Ramakant sir...

799
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:24,973
finally someone bet on your horse.

800
00:59:25,075 --> 00:59:27,134
This horse never won a race for me...

801
00:59:27,477 --> 00:59:30,412
but I hope he wins this race for Silk.

802
00:59:54,905 --> 00:59:59,001
Come on come on, Mountain Storm.

803
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:44,546
At night you prefer to be like
the hands of a clock at 12 o'clock.

804
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:48,221
But during the day,
your clock says 6 o'clock.

805
01:00:50,527 --> 01:00:53,189
I have to control, Silk.

806
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,320
Yesterday if we were seen together...

807
01:00:55,432 --> 01:00:56,990
you would've lost nothing...

808
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,068
but I would've lost everything.

809
01:00:59,469 --> 01:01:01,027
So, which horse did you bet on?

810
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:03,832
The horse that won.

811
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:09,970
I'm the horse that wins.

812
01:01:20,523 --> 01:01:24,516
- Surya! - Radhika!

813
01:01:26,496 --> 01:01:28,555
Go hide in there...

814
01:01:34,904 --> 01:01:37,168
Surya!

815
01:01:37,273 --> 01:01:39,036
Go in will you...

816
01:01:39,509 --> 01:01:41,067
Go in...

817
01:01:41,745 --> 01:01:45,806
Yes? Just coming...

818
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:06,034
Press my head no one does it like you.

819
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:52,911
Silk never took the easy path.

820
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:55,840
Then how could her life ever be easy?

821
01:02:57,654 --> 01:02:59,349
She had broken a million hearts...

822
01:03:00,256 --> 01:03:02,417
and now her heart was at stake.

823
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,825
People say only the heart
breaks but they're wrong.

824
01:03:07,397 --> 01:03:09,729
Every single part of the
body goes into mourning.

825
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,168
The throat becomes dry...

826
01:03:12,268 --> 01:03:14,327
and cheeks remain cold...

827
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:16,665
eyes welled up with tears...

828
01:03:16,773 --> 01:03:18,172
and heart... empty.

829
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:23,569
I learnt about Silk's
misery much later...

830
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,874
otherwise I would've celebrated.

831
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:50,362
Excuse me!

832
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:55,272
Are you alright?

833
01:03:55,912 --> 01:03:57,345
Why wouldn't I be?

834
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:00,677
Should I get a taxi for you?

835
01:04:00,783 --> 01:04:02,375
Why? Don't you have a car?

836
01:04:02,986 --> 01:04:05,011
You... will come along... with me?

837
01:04:07,157 --> 01:04:08,556
Why not? Are you going to rape me?

838
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:09,852
What?

839
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:11,290
Why would you say that?

840
01:04:12,395 --> 01:04:13,589
Excuse me...

841
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,465
just a minute, please.

842
01:04:31,014 --> 01:04:32,743
Don't worry. Just do it.

843
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:34,343
What?

844
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:37,181
You aren't the first man to think...

845
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:40,484
'while shifting the gear if
I could somehow touch her.'

846
01:04:41,858 --> 01:04:43,291
What... no...

847
01:04:43,393 --> 01:04:45,190
I wasn't thinking of that.

848
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:48,990
You work for Suryakant?

849
01:04:49,432 --> 01:04:50,660
I'm his brother.

850
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:56,802
Suryakant... Ramakant...

851
01:04:57,173 --> 01:04:58,902
brothers.

852
01:04:59,842 --> 01:05:02,333
Did you see his wife go in?

853
01:05:02,445 --> 01:05:03,673
Yes.

854
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:07,983
That's when you figured that...

855
01:05:08,418 --> 01:05:11,649
since the permanent one
is in, I will sneak out.

856
01:05:13,356 --> 01:05:15,449
One brother takes me to bed and...

857
01:05:15,658 --> 01:05:18,320
the other is
erecting a bed in his mind!

858
01:05:19,996 --> 01:05:22,988
Why are your
thoughts always so twisted?

859
01:05:26,002 --> 01:05:28,334
Because virtue doesn't
stand a chance in this world.

860
01:05:30,273 --> 01:05:31,570
What do you do?

861
01:05:31,674 --> 01:05:33,471
I'm a writer. I write.

862
01:05:33,576 --> 01:05:35,373
Which was your last film?

863
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:37,806
I haven't got the first one yet.

864
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:40,280
And you'll never get one.

865
01:05:41,017 --> 01:05:42,109
Why not?

866
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:46,183
According to you, there's
only one hero in your family.

867
01:05:46,522 --> 01:05:48,319
And that's Suryakant.

868
01:05:50,226 --> 01:05:52,217
According to you, who is he?

869
01:05:52,495 --> 01:05:53,962
Hero or...

870
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:55,791
a villain?

871
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,860
I've given up classifying people.

872
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,296
Moreover...

873
01:06:02,705 --> 01:06:04,332
the hero and villain don't matter...

874
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:07,642
because I'm the vamp in every story.

875
01:06:12,382 --> 01:06:13,849
I want to go home...

876
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:15,678
will you take me there?

877
01:06:17,053 --> 01:06:18,281
Yes.

878
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:07,896
You see that window?

879
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:12,631
I escaped from it on
the eve of my wedding.

880
01:07:16,012 --> 01:07:17,377
Won't you go in?

881
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:47,007
Mother...

882
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:28,244
This award goes to Silk.

883
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:29,716
And to give this award...

884
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:32,947
I would like to call Mr. Suryakant.

885
01:08:40,263 --> 01:08:43,596
I want to present an award to the
person who chose Silk for this award.

886
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:46,601
She is despicable and...

887
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,397
the person who chose her even worse.

888
01:08:49,939 --> 01:08:52,134
But mister... who the hell are you?

889
01:08:53,576 --> 01:08:54,975
Abraham...

890
01:08:55,077 --> 01:08:56,237
director.

891
01:08:56,345 --> 01:08:57,903
Been a long time since I saw you.

892
01:08:58,247 --> 01:08:59,942
I finally realised...

893
01:09:00,216 --> 01:09:01,877
where to be seen and where not.

894
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:04,475
Success has gone to your head.

895
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:07,619
But many like you have come and gone.

896
01:09:07,723 --> 01:09:09,623
I haven't come here to go away.

897
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:12,791
Look, I'm up here and
the others are down there.

898
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:15,989
You think the people
down there adore you?

899
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:18,824
They are laughing at you.

900
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:22,195
They know very well that
you don't belong with us.

901
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:25,670
You are the fantasy from last night...

902
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:28,005
...that nobody talks about
the next morning.

903
01:09:31,514 --> 01:09:34,142
You are our dirty secret!

904
01:09:35,918 --> 01:09:38,284
At least say thanks...

905
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:52,227
I really don't know
where to begin from.

906
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:56,633
If I begin right at the start,
my mother will be hurt.

907
01:09:58,574 --> 01:10:01,099
If I talk about the present,
you might feel offended.

908
01:10:05,748 --> 01:10:07,841
Because today I won't stop.

909
01:10:10,286 --> 01:10:13,778
Everybody's right eye is twitching
and heart on the left is throbbing...

910
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:15,448
anticipating what I'm about to say.

911
01:10:19,795 --> 01:10:21,820
You must be
wondering why you ever put...

912
01:10:21,931 --> 01:10:24,092
a nobody like me on a pedestal.

913
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:28,599
Some people are famous
because of what they do.

914
01:10:28,704 --> 01:10:31,229
I'm infamous for what I do.

915
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:33,369
Vulgar...

916
01:10:33,476 --> 01:10:34,602
disgusting...

917
01:10:34,677 --> 01:10:35,803
sexy...

918
01:10:35,912 --> 01:10:37,038
dirty...

919
01:10:37,146 --> 01:10:39,137
the words that are
applied to describe me.

920
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:42,316
Just so someone's
film could take off...

921
01:10:42,418 --> 01:10:44,852
I was used as a boarding pass.

922
01:10:45,655 --> 01:10:47,680
Yet people say I'm vulgar.

923
01:10:48,357 --> 01:10:50,257
You made me dance...

924
01:10:51,294 --> 01:10:54,263
but nobody noticed my
effort or my sincerity.

925
01:10:55,031 --> 01:10:58,023
You were busy noticing something else.

926
01:10:58,901 --> 01:11:00,869
Yet you label me disgusting...

927
01:11:02,204 --> 01:11:03,535
sexy...

928
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,470
My films are not meant to be
watched with the family but...

929
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:13,573
people watch them alone and
end up with a bigger family.

930
01:11:16,118 --> 01:11:18,177
If I open a few buttons...

931
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:20,613
then everyone will break into a sweat.

932
01:11:22,325 --> 01:11:23,724
Don't you worry...

933
01:11:24,293 --> 01:11:25,658
I'm leaving...

934
01:11:27,163 --> 01:11:30,826
because except for me,
everyone else here is honourable.

935
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:44,678
But I must say, your
honour is unbelievable.

936
01:11:44,981 --> 01:11:47,472
You make films about sex,
you sell them...

937
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,210
you watch them, you show them...

938
01:11:49,318 --> 01:11:50,910
you even present them with awards...

939
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,479
but you're scared to acknowledge them.

940
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:56,451
Neither will you change, nor will I.

941
01:11:56,926 --> 01:12:00,487
Wrap yourself with your
so-called-honour and...

942
01:12:01,197 --> 01:12:03,722
I will carry on shedding my clothes.

943
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:09,770
I will continue making
these Dirty Pictures.

944
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:13,240
And I will bring these
Dirty Pictures before you.

945
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,012
Who are you?

946
01:12:26,455 --> 01:12:27,649
Nayla.

947
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:28,951
Oh!

948
01:12:29,258 --> 01:12:32,125
So it is you who writes
all the bad stuff about me.

949
01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:37,425
It will be bad if I
stop writing about you.

950
01:12:38,067 --> 01:12:39,295
What do you mean?

951
01:12:39,402 --> 01:12:40,801
I mean...

952
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:43,839
what you're doing
today is a rebellion.

953
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,774
Years later people
will call it freedom.

954
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:49,503
I don't get you.

955
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:51,546
Stay as you are...

956
01:12:51,647 --> 01:12:53,046
like a storm...

957
01:12:53,149 --> 01:12:54,582
don't think too much.

958
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:57,617
Because if you do, you'll fade away.

959
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:00,750
I am Silk.

960
01:13:01,157 --> 01:13:04,183
I'm not some film that will
change after the interval.

961
01:13:49,768 --> 01:13:52,635
That's Surya's wife and
she's coming towards us.

962
01:13:56,608 --> 01:13:58,576
Finally I've met you.

963
01:13:59,077 --> 01:14:00,635
I've heard a lot about you.

964
01:14:01,413 --> 01:14:02,778
I'm sure you have...

965
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:04,314
but there's a lot more to me.

966
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:11,046
I like you better in
person than on the screen.

967
01:14:11,123 --> 01:14:13,956
I heard a lot about you
too and you're less either.

968
01:14:17,529 --> 01:14:19,258
He looks just like his father.

969
01:14:22,734 --> 01:14:24,497
He even behaves like him.

970
01:14:25,637 --> 01:14:26,899
You have no idea...

971
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:29,235
what it is like to
be a superstar's wife.

972
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:32,266
Even so there isn't a lot
of difference between us.

973
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:33,739
No...

974
01:14:34,546 --> 01:14:35,911
there is a lot of difference.

975
01:14:36,548 --> 01:14:37,810
No, Radhikaji...

976
01:14:38,383 --> 01:14:40,214
the difference is as big as a mole.

977
01:14:41,253 --> 01:14:43,312
I have a mole near my heart and...

978
01:14:43,789 --> 01:14:45,347
you have one...

979
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:46,985
on what you sit.

980
01:14:48,627 --> 01:14:50,026
What? How do you know?

981
01:14:50,295 --> 01:14:52,160
Your face gave it away.

982
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:54,126
That you have a mole...

983
01:14:54,967 --> 01:14:56,195
right where I said it is.

984
01:15:15,087 --> 01:15:16,884
Hey writer boy!

985
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:20,590
Are you going to stand by
your brother and not talk to me?

986
01:15:20,993 --> 01:15:23,359
You're pretending as
if you don't know me.

987
01:15:30,702 --> 01:15:31,794
What do you want?

988
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:33,131
Tell me.

989
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:42,342
What I want...

990
01:15:42,714 --> 01:15:44,705
can only be enjoyed at night.

991
01:15:44,816 --> 01:15:45,976
Night?

992
01:15:46,084 --> 01:15:47,346
Why not now?

993
01:15:49,221 --> 01:15:50,848
What will people think?

994
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:53,849
What will Surya think?

995
01:15:56,361 --> 01:15:58,352
Right here, right now?

996
01:16:00,298 --> 01:16:02,391
This is between you and me.

997
01:16:04,403 --> 01:16:05,563
Actually...

998
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:07,729
things didn't work out with Surya.

999
01:16:09,908 --> 01:16:11,899
Now it's all up to you.

1000
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:15,941
I'll see you at night... alone!

1001
01:16:17,049 --> 01:16:18,209
What are you doing?

1002
01:16:18,316 --> 01:16:19,510
You are doing it all wrong.

1003
01:16:19,618 --> 01:16:20,778
Do it right.

1004
01:16:20,886 --> 01:16:22,911
Don't hold it, let me do it.

1005
01:16:23,021 --> 01:16:24,352
You're doing it all wrong.

1006
01:16:24,456 --> 01:16:25,787
I know how to slide it in.

1007
01:16:25,891 --> 01:16:27,119
Is this your first time?

1008
01:16:27,225 --> 01:16:28,351
Never mind me.

1009
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,722
Slide it in properly.

1010
01:16:29,895 --> 01:16:32,864
We haven't even moved
yet and you're all wet!

1011
01:16:32,964 --> 01:16:35,228
Whatever you do, do it nice and easy.

1012
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:37,233
Now ease into first gear...

1013
01:16:37,636 --> 01:16:39,103
slowly.

1014
01:16:40,772 --> 01:16:43,900
Easy, yes... slowly...

1015
01:16:44,009 --> 01:16:46,534
Look straight ahead.

1016
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:48,613
Slowly...

1017
01:16:48,713 --> 01:16:50,408
Yes, that's the way.

1018
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,015
Look straight ahead.

1019
01:16:55,153 --> 01:16:56,711
What are you doing?

1020
01:16:57,022 --> 01:16:58,683
Look straight ahead.

1021
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:02,590
Now add a little pressure on
this pedal, it's the accelerator.

1022
01:17:02,694 --> 01:17:03,888
Okay...

1023
01:17:09,468 --> 01:17:10,730
Thanks.

1024
01:17:10,836 --> 01:17:12,565
Now that you've bought a car...

1025
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:14,536
you should've hired a driver as well.

1026
01:17:16,141 --> 01:17:18,632
I bought the car from
the winnings at the derby.

1027
01:17:18,743 --> 01:17:20,870
I can't decide whether...

1028
01:17:21,113 --> 01:17:23,581
I should hire a driver or a jockey.

1029
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:27,142
Do you know that was my horse?

1030
01:17:27,252 --> 01:17:28,651
Well then...

1031
01:17:28,753 --> 01:17:30,277
you are lucky for me.

1032
01:17:30,422 --> 01:17:32,014
No, you are lucky.

1033
01:17:32,591 --> 01:17:37,255
I saw you whispering to
the horse before the race.

1034
01:17:37,863 --> 01:17:39,296
What did you say?

1035
01:17:39,631 --> 01:17:41,360
It seemed depressed.

1036
01:17:41,633 --> 01:17:44,625
I said nobody has
ever looked at my feet.

1037
01:17:44,903 --> 01:17:47,599
Hold your head high and
leave everyone behind.

1038
01:17:51,176 --> 01:17:52,507
And it did.

1039
01:17:56,748 --> 01:17:59,740
Your words are so loaded
with horsepower that...

1040
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,653
they rein in the wild spirit in men...

1041
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:06,282
...while they revive the
sagging spirit of horses.

1042
01:18:06,892 --> 01:18:08,120
Tell me...

1043
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:10,885
who holds your reins?

1044
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:12,992
Meaning?

1045
01:18:14,132 --> 01:18:16,430
If I spell it out, you'll blush.

1046
01:18:17,602 --> 01:18:19,433
Do you have a girlfriend?

1047
01:18:20,539 --> 01:18:21,699
No.

1048
01:18:22,374 --> 01:18:23,534
Why not?

1049
01:18:25,343 --> 01:18:27,777
In the beginning, a
girlfriend is delicious as cream...

1050
01:18:28,146 --> 01:18:31,377
but then she slowly
engulfs you like cholesterol...

1051
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:34,074
and finally strikes
like a heart attack!

1052
01:18:39,858 --> 01:18:41,485
Fine, I'll see for myself...

1053
01:18:42,627 --> 01:18:46,654
how long an ascetical celibate
like you can resist...

1054
01:18:46,731 --> 01:18:48,665
...the charms of a single woman.

1055
01:19:00,679 --> 01:19:04,547
Ooh la la, Ooh la la,
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

1056
01:19:04,616 --> 01:19:07,050
You are my fantasy

1057
01:19:07,152 --> 01:19:08,380
Ah ah

1058
01:19:08,486 --> 01:19:12,081
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

1059
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:14,158
I am a young lady now

1060
01:19:14,259 --> 01:19:15,954
Hey hey hey hey

1061
01:19:16,061 --> 01:19:19,792
Ooh la la, Ooh la la,
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

1062
01:19:19,864 --> 01:19:22,458
You are my fantasy

1063
01:19:22,534 --> 01:19:23,660
Oh oh

1064
01:19:23,768 --> 01:19:27,363
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

1065
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:31,636
I am a young lady now

1066
01:19:34,779 --> 01:19:38,579
Trying to meet you is like
jumping across an electric fence.

1067
01:19:39,451 --> 01:19:40,850
Sit.

1068
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:43,981
You can get a 440 volt shock anytime!

1069
01:19:44,089 --> 01:19:46,717
Did you think I'm AAA battery?

1070
01:19:46,958 --> 01:19:48,084
I'm a transformer.

1071
01:19:48,193 --> 01:19:49,455
Transformer!

1072
01:19:50,562 --> 01:19:55,158
Are you planning on
giving me something lethal?

1073
01:19:55,567 --> 01:19:57,535
Are you out of breath already?

1074
01:19:57,836 --> 01:19:59,201
You better save some.

1075
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:03,071
What is this?

1076
01:20:03,408 --> 01:20:05,171
Neither is it your birthday nor mine.

1077
01:20:05,243 --> 01:20:06,437
So what's this cake for?

1078
01:20:06,544 --> 01:20:08,910
Blow away your old life.

1079
01:20:09,881 --> 01:20:12,748
And wish your new
one a happy birthday.

1080
01:20:16,488 --> 01:20:18,513
What do you think you're doing?

1081
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:20,155
Are you okay?

1082
01:20:22,494 --> 01:20:25,622
Many who have gained fame
hide behind their black deeds.

1083
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:28,096
At least you are covered in white.

1084
01:20:28,433 --> 01:20:29,695
You are crazy.

1085
01:20:41,346 --> 01:20:42,904
Happy Birthday.

1086
01:20:44,716 --> 01:20:46,877
- What are you doing! - To you too!

1087
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:53,650
Hello!

1088
01:20:58,029 --> 01:21:00,429
Hey guys, stop press now!

1089
01:21:00,765 --> 01:21:02,699
Anything new about Silk?

1090
01:21:02,901 --> 01:21:05,461
I have something that
will create a sensation.

1091
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:08,061
Tell us, Nayla. What did Silk do now?

1092
01:21:08,807 --> 01:21:10,035
I haven't thought about it.

1093
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:11,403
About what?

1094
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:14,010
What do I label Silk?

1095
01:21:14,646 --> 01:21:16,773
Manipulative or helpless?

1096
01:21:17,415 --> 01:21:20,145
Vamp or just a victim?

1097
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:23,751
How are the pictures?

1098
01:21:24,289 --> 01:21:25,586
I'll cut them out.

1099
01:21:25,757 --> 01:21:27,691
What about the
rubbish written about us?

1100
01:21:29,394 --> 01:21:31,362
I don't know what has been written.

1101
01:21:31,963 --> 01:21:34,591
In fact, I don't care and never did!

1102
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:38,292
I cut out the pictures,
but only if they are good.

1103
01:21:38,636 --> 01:21:41,264
A newspaper may go stale in a day...

1104
01:21:42,207 --> 01:21:44,607
but the news in it remains
fresh for years to come.

1105
01:21:46,211 --> 01:21:48,736
And these journalists never
write anything good about you.

1106
01:21:51,216 --> 01:21:53,013
Now they've labelled you Draupadi.

1107
01:22:43,101 --> 01:22:44,295
Ma'am...

1108
01:22:45,503 --> 01:22:46,868
Nayla madam is busy at the party.

1109
01:22:46,971 --> 01:22:50,498
She said she can't meet anyone
and I shouldn't let anyone in.

1110
01:22:51,109 --> 01:22:52,736
Didn't you tell her it's Silk?

1111
01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:55,369
Yes, ma'am, I know you. I told her.

1112
01:22:56,648 --> 01:22:57,979
What's this party about?

1113
01:22:58,216 --> 01:23:01,014
Ma'am, the party is to celebrate
Nayla madam's best journalist award.

1114
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:02,609
A lot of high profile people
and celebrities are present.

1115
01:23:04,656 --> 01:23:05,918
Thank you.

1116
01:23:48,233 --> 01:23:49,495
Kumar...

1117
01:23:53,137 --> 01:23:54,900
call the police.

1118
01:23:59,277 --> 01:24:01,268
I guess they heard I'm on the way.

1119
01:24:01,379 --> 01:24:02,311
Yes, sir.

1120
01:24:02,413 --> 01:24:04,005
But they are looking in
the opposite direction.

1121
01:24:07,886 --> 01:24:10,480
Honk... honk!
Otherwise they won't give way.

1122
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:44,049
I can't stay here like these idiots.

1123
01:24:44,722 --> 01:24:45,814
Let's go back.

1124
01:24:45,924 --> 01:24:47,391
I'll check what's going on.

1125
01:25:15,753 --> 01:25:17,118
Are you alright?

1126
01:25:17,422 --> 01:25:18,719
What are you doing?

1127
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:20,950
Stealing the thunder
from Nayla's party.

1128
01:25:21,726 --> 01:25:23,557
You are unbelievable, Silk.

1129
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:33,234
Why ruin just one party,
when I can ruin two!

1130
01:25:53,224 --> 01:25:55,124
Driver, start the car... come on!

1131
01:26:06,571 --> 01:26:09,131
There are many stars in
this industry, Silk...

1132
01:26:10,241 --> 01:26:13,574
but there's only one hero
- you.

1133
01:26:17,615 --> 01:26:18,980
That was unbelievable.

1134
01:26:22,286 --> 01:26:24,652
You publicly wrecked
her private party.

1135
01:26:25,089 --> 01:26:28,456
Now Nayla will never celebrate
anything, not even her birthday!

1136
01:26:28,993 --> 01:26:32,156
Once Silk decides on something,
she goes through with it.

1137
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:33,758
Surya, for instance.

1138
01:26:33,831 --> 01:26:36,664
His mouth was open
like an uncovered manhole.

1139
01:26:40,138 --> 01:26:41,833
I hope you didn't mind...

1140
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,667
me kissing you.

1141
01:26:46,344 --> 01:26:48,574
My heart said so and I did.

1142
01:26:49,313 --> 01:26:51,178
Even though the
heart is on the left...

1143
01:26:52,216 --> 01:26:54,650
its decisions are always right.

1144
01:26:57,221 --> 01:27:00,622
Wow, the writer rises...

1145
01:27:01,492 --> 01:27:03,255
You should sleep.

1146
01:27:03,861 --> 01:27:06,421
Tomorrow I have
narrate the story to Vijayan.

1147
01:27:06,898 --> 01:27:09,128
And you have a shoot too.

1148
01:27:10,134 --> 01:27:12,193
We just left two
people burning with anger...

1149
01:27:12,804 --> 01:27:14,795
and you want to put it out?

1150
01:27:15,239 --> 01:27:18,402
If I stay back, a fire
will start over here.

1151
01:27:20,678 --> 01:27:22,009
Then let it.

1152
01:27:30,354 --> 01:27:32,219
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

1153
01:27:32,323 --> 01:27:35,156
You are my...

1154
01:27:35,426 --> 01:27:37,986
You don't call out to
others when you're on the edge.

1155
01:27:41,099 --> 01:27:42,623
The bullet exits the gun...

1156
01:27:42,834 --> 01:27:44,631
The villain's spirit exits his body...

1157
01:27:45,002 --> 01:27:46,629
The end of the film.

1158
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:47,930
And the audience exits the theater.

1159
01:27:48,005 --> 01:27:49,734
What kind of ending is this?

1160
01:27:50,007 --> 01:27:51,872
I didn't even have a fight sequence.

1161
01:27:52,710 --> 01:27:55,372
Swords are pulled
out of their sheath...

1162
01:27:55,613 --> 01:27:57,706
Clothes ripped apart...

1163
01:27:58,282 --> 01:27:59,943
Bodies ripped apart... Blood all over.

1164
01:28:00,051 --> 01:28:01,848
That leads to the end of the film.

1165
01:28:01,953 --> 01:28:04,922
You should have a sword fight,
yes a sword fight.

1166
01:28:05,223 --> 01:28:07,350
Sir, the lead hero is a cop.

1167
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:09,759
How could he have a sword?

1168
01:28:11,462 --> 01:28:13,692
That's a valid point.

1169
01:28:14,932 --> 01:28:16,593
Perhaps an ancestral sword...

1170
01:28:17,101 --> 01:28:19,296
a family heirloom.

1171
01:28:20,304 --> 01:28:22,135
But, Sir... the lead
hero is an orphan.

1172
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:23,605
Boring!

1173
01:28:24,809 --> 01:28:26,538
Boring!

1174
01:28:27,578 --> 01:28:31,605
Lead heroes of the 60s
and 70s were orphans.

1175
01:28:31,783 --> 01:28:33,944
We are in the 80s now.

1176
01:28:34,886 --> 01:28:38,253
Let him have a family.

1177
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:40,680
And a sister...

1178
01:28:40,925 --> 01:28:42,153
give her dignity...

1179
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:43,750
And then take it away!

1180
01:28:44,061 --> 01:28:48,157
His sister's trampled dignity...

1181
01:28:48,533 --> 01:28:51,696
should reflect on his sword.

1182
01:28:52,069 --> 01:28:54,367
Now that will heighten the climax!

1183
01:28:54,739 --> 01:28:55,865
What do you say, Vijayan?

1184
01:28:55,973 --> 01:28:58,134
Sir, what an imagination!

1185
01:28:58,342 --> 01:29:00,367
Genius... Sir, you're a genius!

1186
01:29:00,912 --> 01:29:05,042
It's a curse, Vijayan. It's a curse!

1187
01:29:06,083 --> 01:29:08,051
What do you think, Rama?

1188
01:29:09,287 --> 01:29:10,686
I have one word...

1189
01:29:11,889 --> 01:29:13,151
Superhit!

1190
01:29:14,091 --> 01:29:16,855
Sir, sensational, this
will be sensational!

1191
01:29:17,228 --> 01:29:20,163
Silk couldn't differentiate
between a man and a horse.

1192
01:29:20,631 --> 01:29:23,566
A horse at its peak will win derbies.

1193
01:29:25,736 --> 01:29:29,263
But a man at his peak
moves like time itself.

1194
01:29:29,841 --> 01:29:33,004
Then he can neither stop.

1195
01:29:40,484 --> 01:29:42,543
Do you remember...
when we first met...

1196
01:29:43,387 --> 01:29:45,150
you couldn't utter a word.

1197
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:48,117
And now you make excuses!

1198
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:56,392
There was a time when I'd merely
think of you and you would show up.

1199
01:29:57,802 --> 01:29:58,928
And now...

1200
01:29:59,237 --> 01:30:01,000
you think twice before meeting me.

1201
01:30:01,105 --> 01:30:02,265
Cut it!

1202
01:30:04,008 --> 01:30:05,168
What are you laughing for?

1203
01:30:05,276 --> 01:30:07,744
You think this is a joke?

1204
01:30:07,845 --> 01:30:09,745
You are the one making a joke, madam.

1205
01:30:09,981 --> 01:30:12,142
We shot this scene yesterday.

1206
01:30:14,318 --> 01:30:15,717
I need a cigarette!

1207
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:16,980
Silk...

1208
01:30:17,088 --> 01:30:18,680
what's going on?

1209
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:21,055
Once upon a time,
you'd act out a scene and...

1210
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,786
...I didn't feel like
calling out 'cut'.

1211
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,492
But it seems like you
don't feel like acting anymore.

1212
01:30:25,596 --> 01:30:27,086
How can I?

1213
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:28,856
There's nothing new to do.

1214
01:30:28,966 --> 01:30:32,367
Everyday it's the same old scene,
same old dialogue, same old story.

1215
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:35,337
You can only act in
one particular film...

1216
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:36,770
and I'll make it.

1217
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:42,673
I know why you're so arrogant today.

1218
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:45,744
You've signed on
that new girl, Shakeela.

1219
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:47,442
But Venkat sir...

1220
01:30:47,652 --> 01:30:49,552
there can never be another Silk.

1221
01:30:49,654 --> 01:30:51,281
And we don't want another Silk!

1222
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:52,583
Everyday it's something new.

1223
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:54,214
A new spat with Surya...

1224
01:30:54,292 --> 01:30:55,782
or a new scene with his brother.

1225
01:30:55,893 --> 01:30:57,485
Or your love for the bottle.

1226
01:30:57,595 --> 01:30:59,529
In that case, 'pack up'!

1227
01:31:03,834 --> 01:31:05,392
Make this film with that...

1228
01:31:05,503 --> 01:31:08,233
that girl... Shakeela!

1229
01:31:08,339 --> 01:31:09,533
Silk, wait,

1230
01:31:10,007 --> 01:31:11,668
don't make a mistake. You'll regret.

1231
01:31:11,776 --> 01:31:14,040
People who walk out on their work...

1232
01:31:14,145 --> 01:31:16,409
spend the rest of their
lives begging for work.

1233
01:31:16,514 --> 01:31:17,981
But they get nothing.

1234
01:31:18,082 --> 01:31:19,208
I am Silk.

1235
01:31:19,317 --> 01:31:20,477
Silk.

1236
01:31:20,584 --> 01:31:23,178
Don't forget I'm a star.

1237
01:31:24,755 --> 01:31:27,849
When stars fade away, they
become one with the darkness.

1238
01:31:27,959 --> 01:31:30,450
And when the bare darkness strikes...

1239
01:31:30,561 --> 01:31:33,689
the first thing it takes
away is the star's shine.

1240
01:31:48,646 --> 01:31:49,806
Hello...

1241
01:31:49,981 --> 01:31:51,175
Ramakant, please.

1242
01:31:51,649 --> 01:31:53,207
Madam, he is busy at a pooja.
[Religious offering]

1243
01:31:53,317 --> 01:31:54,443
Pooja?

1244
01:31:54,585 --> 01:31:55,813
For what?

1245
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,912
Madam, it's a pooja for his new film.

1246
01:31:59,357 --> 01:32:02,258
Tell Ramakant it's Silk!

1247
01:32:03,461 --> 01:32:05,622
Sorry madam, I can't disturb him.

1248
01:32:18,676 --> 01:32:19,836
Hello...

1249
01:32:19,944 --> 01:32:21,935
Hello, give the phone to Ramakant!

1250
01:32:22,013 --> 01:32:22,911
Madam...

1251
01:32:23,014 --> 01:32:25,141
Tell Ramakant it's Silk!

1252
01:32:28,686 --> 01:32:31,655
It's Silk madam on the line.
She wants to talk to you.

1253
01:32:32,156 --> 01:32:33,885
Tell her I'll call her later.

1254
01:32:33,991 --> 01:32:35,322
Okay.

1255
01:32:38,729 --> 01:32:40,094
I'm sorry, madam.

1256
01:32:40,398 --> 01:32:41,956
I can't disturb him.

1257
01:32:43,134 --> 01:32:44,897
Suryakant sir...

1258
01:32:48,906 --> 01:32:50,339
Sir, I'm very happy.

1259
01:32:50,775 --> 01:32:53,539
One brother will write,
the other will act.

1260
01:32:53,644 --> 01:32:54,975
Today is a great day.

1261
01:32:55,079 --> 01:32:56,546
And Silk will dance.

1262
01:32:59,650 --> 01:33:01,140
Excuse me.

1263
01:33:03,287 --> 01:33:04,447
Vijayan!

1264
01:33:04,522 --> 01:33:05,784
Yes, sir?

1265
01:33:08,459 --> 01:33:09,892
Silk...

1266
01:33:10,428 --> 01:33:12,328
will not act in this film.

1267
01:33:13,531 --> 01:33:16,329
The audience has seen
every inch of her talent.

1268
01:33:17,001 --> 01:33:18,491
Sir, as you wish.

1269
01:33:18,602 --> 01:33:19,694
But sir...

1270
01:33:19,804 --> 01:33:21,795
the public demands excitement.

1271
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:25,102
We will change the trend.

1272
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:28,375
Everything that Silk did...

1273
01:33:28,779 --> 01:33:31,612
we'll get the heroine to do.

1274
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:33,741
That's fine...

1275
01:33:33,818 --> 01:33:35,683
sir but what about
the heroine's image?

1276
01:33:35,786 --> 01:33:38,254
The public goes for the goods on
display, the store doesn't matter.

1277
01:33:39,623 --> 01:33:43,081
When honour is disrobed...

1278
01:33:43,194 --> 01:33:45,754
it's the 'honourable'
ones that enjoy it the most.

1279
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:48,555
You're right, absolutely right, sir.

1280
01:33:49,033 --> 01:33:51,399
Ramakant, what do you have to say?

1281
01:33:52,236 --> 01:33:53,396
Sir...

1282
01:33:53,504 --> 01:33:54,994
Silk madam on the line.

1283
01:33:57,074 --> 01:33:58,302
Silk...

1284
01:33:58,576 --> 01:34:00,168
what a coincidence.

1285
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:02,668
We were just talking about you.

1286
01:34:03,481 --> 01:34:05,278
I'm here with Vijayan and Surya.

1287
01:34:07,051 --> 01:34:09,315
They don't want you
for their next film.

1288
01:34:10,454 --> 01:34:13,014
And I think their decision is right.

1289
01:34:14,091 --> 01:34:15,752
You won't do this film.

1290
01:34:15,826 --> 01:34:17,885
Absolutely not!

1291
01:34:18,896 --> 01:34:21,057
On the first day of the shoot...

1292
01:34:21,165 --> 01:34:24,225
I would like to
introduce you to my parents.

1293
01:34:36,847 --> 01:34:38,337
Hello, Silk ma'am.

1294
01:34:38,449 --> 01:34:39,780
I am Mutthu.

1295
01:34:39,884 --> 01:34:41,977
I am a small time film maker.

1296
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,915
I would to work with you.

1297
01:34:44,989 --> 01:34:46,286
This is my card.

1298
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,652
Drop it at my place.

1299
01:34:47,758 --> 01:34:50,056
Okay, thank you very much.

1300
01:34:50,294 --> 01:34:51,659
Excuse me.

1301
01:34:51,996 --> 01:34:53,691
Well, the set is beautiful.

1302
01:34:54,832 --> 01:34:56,356
Congratulations.

1303
01:34:56,834 --> 01:34:58,893
It's all thanks to you.

1304
01:35:01,839 --> 01:35:03,830
And don't make a mess today.

1305
01:35:04,642 --> 01:35:06,701
My parents will be here soon.

1306
01:35:08,045 --> 01:35:09,478
Your mother is fine but...

1307
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,477
how old is your father?

1308
01:35:12,383 --> 01:35:13,907
Silk, please!

1309
01:35:17,655 --> 01:35:18,986
Relax will you!

1310
01:35:20,124 --> 01:35:22,854
I'm a hit with the men in your family.

1311
01:35:25,229 --> 01:35:27,663
You know... I don't like such jokes.

1312
01:35:28,599 --> 01:35:30,533
Ramakant sir...

1313
01:35:32,636 --> 01:35:33,830
One second.

1314
01:35:39,109 --> 01:35:40,440
Silk madam...

1315
01:35:41,145 --> 01:35:43,375
I'm a big fan of yours.

1316
01:35:43,581 --> 01:35:44,878
Thank you.

1317
01:35:44,982 --> 01:35:46,711
I am Shakeela.

1318
01:35:52,923 --> 01:35:54,288
So you're Shakeela!

1319
01:35:54,391 --> 01:35:55,983
You've heard about me?

1320
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:00,991
Yes, but it was probably a lie.

1321
01:36:01,498 --> 01:36:03,159
Why do you say that?

1322
01:36:06,904 --> 01:36:08,428
Do you have a mirror at home?

1323
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:11,098
Break it...

1324
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:15,274
because it's lying that
you can be another Silk.

1325
01:36:18,616 --> 01:36:20,140
You are wrong!

1326
01:36:20,818 --> 01:36:23,048
I'm sure I have something...

1327
01:36:24,455 --> 01:36:27,618
I have the talent.

1328
01:36:30,894 --> 01:36:32,122
Is that so?

1329
01:36:33,297 --> 01:36:34,628
Come on then!

1330
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:10,398
There is that night of the honeymoon

1331
01:37:10,501 --> 01:37:13,698
I am that night

1332
01:37:13,937 --> 01:37:17,737
The joy of that night

1333
01:37:17,841 --> 01:37:20,173
I am that joy

1334
01:37:20,277 --> 01:37:24,043
That knocks the lover senseless

1335
01:37:24,148 --> 01:37:27,606
I am that intoxication

1336
01:37:27,718 --> 01:37:31,279
The mantra to love and
relationships that you have read

1337
01:37:31,355 --> 01:37:34,654
I am that book

1338
01:37:34,825 --> 01:37:38,283
I am that book.

1339
01:37:39,263 --> 01:37:41,026
I play like the banjo

1340
01:37:41,131 --> 01:37:42,826
I blossom in dreams

1341
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:46,529
Gentlemen, make me infamous

1342
01:37:46,637 --> 01:37:48,264
I intoxicate you like whiskey

1343
01:37:48,372 --> 01:37:50,101
I grapple like a hiccup

1344
01:37:50,207 --> 01:37:53,370
Get intoxicated, my gentleman

1345
01:37:53,844 --> 01:37:55,835
We forget

1346
01:37:55,946 --> 01:37:57,573
ourselves

1347
01:37:57,681 --> 01:38:00,809
give me a drink like that

1348
01:38:15,532 --> 01:38:18,899
Make the room dark

1349
01:38:19,002 --> 01:38:22,460
open your eyes

1350
01:38:22,573 --> 01:38:24,632
Whatever is in your heart

1351
01:38:24,742 --> 01:38:29,702
whisper it in my
ears through some crowds

1352
01:38:30,114 --> 01:38:33,606
Don't worry about the danger

1353
01:38:33,717 --> 01:38:37,084
Surpass all the limits

1354
01:38:37,187 --> 01:38:38,882
Come forth

1355
01:38:38,989 --> 01:38:40,957
don't struggle with me

1356
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:43,891
leave everything to me

1357
01:38:44,261 --> 01:38:46,855
Bad

1358
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:50,299
half... sullen... departed

1359
01:38:50,401 --> 01:38:51,993
broken, is your dream

1360
01:38:52,102 --> 01:38:54,627
without me

1361
01:38:59,843 --> 01:39:01,572
It is only me

1362
01:39:01,678 --> 01:39:03,475
I am that intoxication

1363
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:07,516
Blend us together

1364
01:39:20,998 --> 01:39:22,465
Let her go!

1365
01:39:23,734 --> 01:39:25,599
She isn't worthy of you.

1366
01:39:27,571 --> 01:39:29,562
Women like Silk
don't belong at home...

1367
01:39:29,673 --> 01:39:32,073
a bed is where they belong.

1368
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:35,002
What have you done, Silk?

1369
01:39:35,712 --> 01:39:37,907
I had told you... don't think.

1370
01:39:38,782 --> 01:39:40,750
You gave up too soon.

1371
01:39:48,659 --> 01:39:50,559
Say what you want to!

1372
01:39:52,563 --> 01:39:55,123
Couldn't you control
yourself for just one night?

1373
01:39:55,232 --> 01:39:56,824
What difference would that make?

1374
01:39:56,934 --> 01:39:59,459
Would your parents
think I'm a decent girl?

1375
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:01,629
What is their impression now?

1376
01:40:02,739 --> 01:40:05,902
They think you are
lewd and disgusting.

1377
01:40:06,076 --> 01:40:08,601
Well, you're in love
with someone like her.

1378
01:40:09,246 --> 01:40:11,771
That's my character on screen.
I'm not like that in real life.

1379
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:14,815
You mean you'll stay
like this all your life?

1380
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:16,949
Lewd and disgusting?

1381
01:40:17,154 --> 01:40:19,850
The thing that made me Silk...

1382
01:40:20,057 --> 01:40:21,649
how can I let it go?

1383
01:40:23,694 --> 01:40:25,457
Surya was right...

1384
01:40:26,129 --> 01:40:28,825
women like Silk
don't belong at home...

1385
01:40:33,237 --> 01:40:36,263
Of course, a bed is
where they belong isn't it!

1386
01:40:46,216 --> 01:40:50,084
Silk's noose is ready
for both of you.

1387
01:40:56,693 --> 01:40:59,127
You call me lewd and disgusting...

1388
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:02,592
see how I ruin you!

1389
01:43:17,267 --> 01:43:20,031
What you're
proposing is a very big risk.

1390
01:43:20,871 --> 01:43:22,202
Think about it.

1391
01:43:23,674 --> 01:43:26,074
When God has blessed
you with one life...

1392
01:43:26,410 --> 01:43:28,207
why think twice?

1393
01:43:28,679 --> 01:43:29,873
No, think again.

1394
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:32,414
You could lose all
that you have earned.

1395
01:43:33,817 --> 01:43:36,377
I never thought I'd
get what I have earned.

1396
01:43:36,453 --> 01:43:39,320
You need to do a lot of
films to earn that much.

1397
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:42,859
But only one is enough to lose it all.

1398
01:43:43,527 --> 01:43:44,824
It's your blood and sweat...

1399
01:43:44,928 --> 01:43:46,225
that's why I'm telling you.

1400
01:43:46,296 --> 01:43:47,991
I've seen you rise up...

1401
01:43:48,932 --> 01:43:50,661
I can't bear to see you fall.

1402
01:43:52,602 --> 01:43:56,299
Silk trusts her Mr. Worm.

1403
01:43:59,609 --> 01:44:02,806
I love your idea of a triple role!

1404
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:05,048
One mother and two daughters.

1405
01:44:05,382 --> 01:44:07,111
That's what I thought.

1406
01:44:07,684 --> 01:44:11,552
When people see one Silk,
their tongues hit the floor.

1407
01:44:11,722 --> 01:44:14,282
When they see three Silks together...

1408
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:16,154
their trousers will hit the floor!

1409
01:44:19,663 --> 01:44:20,960
Remember Abraham?

1410
01:44:21,631 --> 01:44:23,963
What about him? Is he dead?

1411
01:44:24,234 --> 01:44:25,496
He is alive.

1412
01:44:25,769 --> 01:44:28,260
He is also making a triple role film.

1413
01:44:28,438 --> 01:44:29,871
And he is playing the lead.

1414
01:44:30,574 --> 01:44:32,132
Ramakant is writing the script.

1415
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:35,234
Mr. Worm...

1416
01:44:35,846 --> 01:44:38,076
do you know why Silk is so expensive?

1417
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:43,212
Because it is meant to shine.

1418
01:44:44,387 --> 01:44:45,877
Let him make his film.

1419
01:44:46,289 --> 01:44:48,553
We will watch it and
so will the public.

1420
01:44:51,595 --> 01:44:54,063
The era of hate was over.

1421
01:44:54,498 --> 01:44:56,966
Now it was time to
destroy Silk, once and for all.

1422
01:44:57,067 --> 01:45:00,332
She stole my idea to
compete against me!

1423
01:45:00,504 --> 01:45:01,835
I will put an end to her!

1424
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:29,460
Hello, Mr. Worm...

1425
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:31,462
Good good!

1426
01:45:31,535 --> 01:45:34,595
Mr. Worm, will the
trousers come down or not?

1427
01:45:34,938 --> 01:45:37,964
Everything will come down.

1428
01:46:08,405 --> 01:46:09,736
Your cheque.

1429
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,137
Thanks.

1430
01:48:06,690 --> 01:48:09,921
You stepped on the beach
and the tide subsided.

1431
01:48:11,394 --> 01:48:13,589
When the tide rises...

1432
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:16,196
you will be the first to drown.

1433
01:48:16,499 --> 01:48:18,763
I even swam through the
giant waves in a storm...

1434
01:48:19,569 --> 01:48:21,196
and that's the reason I've survived.

1435
01:48:21,905 --> 01:48:23,167
But you...

1436
01:48:25,208 --> 01:48:28,041
you're back to where you started from.

1437
01:48:28,244 --> 01:48:30,235
Well, even you've come to me.

1438
01:48:31,181 --> 01:48:33,012
You can't live without me.

1439
01:48:33,850 --> 01:48:35,579
My biggest fan.

1440
01:48:41,591 --> 01:48:43,582
I'm here to celebrate your defeat.

1441
01:48:43,827 --> 01:48:44,987
Why?

1442
01:48:45,061 --> 01:48:47,757
Don't have anyone to
celebrate your success with?

1443
01:48:54,337 --> 01:48:55,668
I had told you...

1444
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:58,498
you can't defeat me.

1445
01:48:59,376 --> 01:49:01,105
But the fight was a pleasure.

1446
01:49:01,478 --> 01:49:03,912
Silk is born to give pleasure.

1447
01:49:04,414 --> 01:49:07,747
To her well-wishers and her opponents.

1448
01:49:11,454 --> 01:49:13,149
And you are extra special.

1449
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:19,355
That's what the newspapers say.

1450
01:49:21,464 --> 01:49:24,297
But there's something you
still haven't revealed...

1451
01:49:25,735 --> 01:49:27,862
the fact that you like me.

1452
01:49:33,076 --> 01:49:34,338
Flop actress.

1453
01:49:34,711 --> 01:49:37,202
She had the last
word like the lead hero.

1454
01:49:40,316 --> 01:49:41,510
I like her?

1455
01:49:41,584 --> 01:49:42,710
I...

1456
01:49:42,819 --> 01:49:44,844
If she were the last woman on earth...

1457
01:49:45,055 --> 01:49:46,784
I'd castrate myself!

1458
01:49:56,099 --> 01:49:57,566
Murli...

1459
01:49:59,869 --> 01:50:01,496
Murli...

1460
01:50:02,105 --> 01:50:03,697
a large coffee, please.

1461
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,407
And for the two women?

1462
01:50:05,508 --> 01:50:06,600
Beer or tequila?

1463
01:50:06,709 --> 01:50:09,200
Success does bestow a
certain energy, Murli.

1464
01:50:09,712 --> 01:50:10,872
Two girls?

1465
01:50:11,281 --> 01:50:12,771
It's not what you think.

1466
01:50:12,882 --> 01:50:14,543
One brought you home last night.

1467
01:50:14,651 --> 01:50:17,211
And the other is waiting
outside with her camera.

1468
01:50:18,221 --> 01:50:19,848
Ask the one with the camera to wait...

1469
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:21,919
and send the one
from last night packing!

1470
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:23,489
I'm leaving!

1471
01:50:25,795 --> 01:50:27,262
Last night was great, wasn't it?

1472
01:50:27,464 --> 01:50:28,556
No way!

1473
01:50:28,665 --> 01:50:31,361
And you should be with Silk, not me!

1474
01:50:32,102 --> 01:50:35,469
All night you kept talking
about that disgusting woman!

1475
01:50:36,539 --> 01:50:37,870
Oh, I'm sorry baby.

1476
01:50:39,309 --> 01:50:40,674
Tell me something...

1477
01:50:42,011 --> 01:50:43,808
when I was talking about her...

1478
01:50:44,547 --> 01:50:46,276
was it with hatred or affection?

1479
01:50:46,516 --> 01:50:47,949
What?

1480
01:50:48,685 --> 01:50:52,212
The problem is I... I hate her...

1481
01:50:52,822 --> 01:50:55,484
but she thinks I love her.

1482
01:50:56,493 --> 01:50:58,961
I want to know what my
feelings have to say.

1483
01:50:59,362 --> 01:51:00,829
You are mad...

1484
01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:02,625
absolutely mad!

1485
01:51:03,133 --> 01:51:04,532
Bye... I will call you.

1486
01:51:05,502 --> 01:51:06,764
Yeah, sure!

1487
01:51:07,003 --> 01:51:08,561
You don't even know my name!

1488
01:51:10,373 --> 01:51:13,206
Yet you spent the night with me and...

1489
01:51:13,543 --> 01:51:15,170
are calling Silk disgusting!

1490
01:51:25,622 --> 01:51:28,648
How did I end up in this
Shakespearean tragedy, Silk?

1491
01:51:29,759 --> 01:51:32,159
Earlier I fought with you
and now I'm fighting for you!

1492
01:51:39,135 --> 01:51:41,831
Your girlfriend left
hurling abuses at you.

1493
01:51:43,273 --> 01:51:44,467
She was nothing.

1494
01:51:45,108 --> 01:51:47,372
Last week a girl almost broke my head!

1495
01:51:47,944 --> 01:51:49,468
Back then you were nothing...

1496
01:51:49,779 --> 01:51:51,041
now you are.

1497
01:51:52,081 --> 01:51:53,776
Next week again I'll be nothing.

1498
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:56,316
I'm not some film
that changes every week.

1499
01:51:57,253 --> 01:52:00,347
You just reminded me of someone.

1500
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:02,922
I imagined I was the only
antique piece around here.

1501
01:52:04,561 --> 01:52:06,426
Hey, by the way, congrats.

1502
01:52:06,529 --> 01:52:08,224
You've defeated Silk.

1503
01:52:09,065 --> 01:52:10,532
I can't believe you guys!

1504
01:52:11,467 --> 01:52:13,492
I get no credit for my success.

1505
01:52:13,903 --> 01:52:15,894
You're congratulating
me because Silk failed.

1506
01:52:16,272 --> 01:52:17,466
Abraham...

1507
01:52:17,674 --> 01:52:19,141
whose corner are you in?

1508
01:52:19,776 --> 01:52:22,438
Our corner or Silk's corner?

1509
01:52:22,979 --> 01:52:24,446
I hate her.

1510
01:52:25,148 --> 01:52:27,378
And if you want to
continue talking about her...

1511
01:52:27,483 --> 01:52:28,848
then this interview is over!

1512
01:52:28,985 --> 01:52:30,111
I didn't know that...

1513
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:32,552
Silk is such a sensitive topic.

1514
01:52:32,956 --> 01:52:34,287
Tell me something...

1515
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:37,484
what brought about this
drastic change in your films?

1516
01:52:39,529 --> 01:52:42,760
You see... one day I was watching
my own film and I fell asleep.

1517
01:52:44,234 --> 01:52:46,429
That's when I realised something.

1518
01:52:47,503 --> 01:52:50,097
Films need three things to sell...

1519
01:52:51,474 --> 01:52:55,376
entertainment,
entertainment, entertainment!

1520
01:53:21,137 --> 01:53:23,401
Silk... anything important?

1521
01:53:24,307 --> 01:53:26,104
I have come here to get high.

1522
01:53:27,343 --> 01:53:30,073
You know acting always gets me high.

1523
01:53:31,114 --> 01:53:32,638
Silk, you know very well that...

1524
01:53:32,982 --> 01:53:35,780
neither I nor anybody
else will give you any work.

1525
01:53:37,787 --> 01:53:40,153
But if you want some money...

1526
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:42,519
Do you have five rupees?

1527
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:45,857
Five rupees?

1528
01:53:47,196 --> 01:53:49,790
When I first tried to get
into films, someone told me...

1529
01:53:49,899 --> 01:53:52,163
that nobody would give me any work.

1530
01:53:52,535 --> 01:53:54,230
He gave me five
rupees and sent me away.

1531
01:53:55,305 --> 01:53:57,102
Sir, give me five rupees.

1532
01:53:57,507 --> 01:53:59,737
Probably those days will come back.

1533
01:54:11,254 --> 01:54:12,915
I was the dog that...

1534
01:54:13,022 --> 01:54:15,490
had gone mad after biting Silk.

1535
01:54:17,193 --> 01:54:19,525
I never let a friend
get close to me...

1536
01:54:19,629 --> 01:54:22,792
but Silk was, all
thanks to our enmity.

1537
01:54:23,132 --> 01:54:24,565
Why did I go to her?

1538
01:54:24,667 --> 01:54:26,066
For company?

1539
01:54:26,569 --> 01:54:29,094
For lack of a friend,
an enemy would do.

1540
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:42,412
Don't stare at me.

1541
01:54:43,019 --> 01:54:46,079
It's as if the oven is
awaiting a marinated chicken!

1542
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:50,118
At least try to give
yourself some respect in your words.

1543
01:54:51,627 --> 01:54:53,492
Anyway, what are you doing here?

1544
01:54:54,097 --> 01:54:56,258
For lack of a friend,
an enemy will do.

1545
01:54:59,035 --> 01:55:01,060
I've destroyed you...

1546
01:55:02,171 --> 01:55:06,574
I was here to see how
many stitches Silk needs.

1547
01:55:09,746 --> 01:55:11,771
Have a coffee... I'll pay for it.

1548
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:15,913
Two Silk coffees, please.

1549
01:55:19,922 --> 01:55:22,083
The coffee that goes by
my name is quite famous.

1550
01:55:22,959 --> 01:55:23,983
Try it.

1551
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:25,994
It's the best cure for a hangover.

1552
01:55:27,897 --> 01:55:29,159
You will burn in hell!

1553
01:55:29,465 --> 01:55:30,659
And you...

1554
01:55:32,068 --> 01:55:35,003
you will enjoy it as a
bonfire and warm your hands.

1555
01:55:56,426 --> 01:55:58,826
My heart and mind
were caught in a duel.

1556
01:55:59,295 --> 01:56:02,787
I guess I was too high
that I began to like Silk.

1557
01:56:03,566 --> 01:56:04,533
The mind warned...

1558
01:56:04,634 --> 01:56:06,659
'Don't be an idiot, control yourself.'

1559
01:56:07,036 --> 01:56:09,402
For every man there is a woman.

1560
01:56:09,572 --> 01:56:12,268
If you can stay away from her,
life will be great.

1561
01:56:12,475 --> 01:56:13,703
Otherwise it's over.

1562
01:56:29,759 --> 01:56:30,987
I viewed from different angles...

1563
01:56:31,093 --> 01:56:32,424
in different poses...

1564
01:56:33,029 --> 01:56:34,496
even stood on my head...

1565
01:56:35,231 --> 01:56:36,459
but same results.

1566
01:56:38,234 --> 01:56:39,633
I can never like you.

1567
01:56:42,004 --> 01:56:43,733
You better get yourself checked...

1568
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:47,441
or you won't like your wife
the day after your wedding.

1569
01:56:53,616 --> 01:56:54,947
Do you have any alcohol?

1570
01:56:56,552 --> 01:56:58,520
Do I look like an idiot?

1571
01:56:59,255 --> 01:57:02,156
That I offer you a
drink and let you abuse me?

1572
01:57:04,994 --> 01:57:07,019
I want a drink because
I don't want to abuse.

1573
01:57:08,464 --> 01:57:10,159
I think you're the type of girl...

1574
01:57:10,266 --> 01:57:12,257
who looks better after a drink.

1575
01:57:22,879 --> 01:57:24,642
This is the worst!

1576
01:57:25,314 --> 01:57:28,044
You mean it struck a
chord in your heart.

1577
01:57:30,186 --> 01:57:32,086
The colour of the bathtub is awful...

1578
01:57:32,555 --> 01:57:34,216
there should've been more bubbles...

1579
01:57:34,557 --> 01:57:35,717
I didn't like it.

1580
01:57:35,992 --> 01:57:37,186
Then give it back.

1581
01:57:38,094 --> 01:57:39,322
I'm keeping it.

1582
01:57:42,298 --> 01:57:43,629
What about this?

1583
01:57:48,604 --> 01:57:50,629
Even children wear
more clothes than you.

1584
01:58:05,288 --> 01:58:08,587
If you manage to live
up to a ripe old age...

1585
01:58:09,125 --> 01:58:11,150
you will look
exactly like your mother.

1586
01:58:12,562 --> 01:58:13,961
That's not my mother...

1587
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:15,327
it's me!

1588
01:58:16,632 --> 01:58:18,998
Nayla wanted to interview my mother.

1589
01:58:19,435 --> 01:58:21,266
You know Nayla...

1590
01:58:21,537 --> 01:58:23,801
she can be very persistent.

1591
01:58:24,707 --> 01:58:26,572
It was not easy to say 'no' to her...

1592
01:58:26,676 --> 01:58:28,268
but it was easy to
become my own mother.

1593
01:58:29,045 --> 01:58:31,912
So... I dusted my hair with powder,
wore a dull saree...

1594
01:58:32,014 --> 01:58:33,379
and gave the interview.

1595
01:58:35,451 --> 01:58:37,885
Have you done anything straight?

1596
01:58:38,854 --> 01:58:40,549
Why didn't you take
Nayla to your mother?

1597
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:45,452
My mother had slammed the door on me.

1598
01:58:47,063 --> 01:58:48,690
Why would they talk about me...

1599
01:58:48,798 --> 01:58:50,925
when they are
embarrassed they gave birth to me.

1600
01:58:55,438 --> 01:58:57,838
If you weren't born at all,
how would the world ever know...

1601
01:58:57,940 --> 01:58:59,965
that women can also be like you!

1602
01:59:02,979 --> 01:59:04,276
Is that an abuse
disguised as praise...

1603
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:06,348
or praise concealed in an abuse?

1604
01:59:09,585 --> 01:59:11,849
I can't praise you...

1605
01:59:12,588 --> 01:59:15,056
and lately I can't even abuse you.

1606
01:59:16,592 --> 01:59:18,924
Be careful, Abraham.

1607
01:59:19,895 --> 01:59:22,455
I guess... you're starting to like me.

1608
01:59:25,701 --> 01:59:28,261
I told you, you're the type of girl...

1609
01:59:28,371 --> 01:59:29,998
who looks better after a drink.

1610
01:59:35,244 --> 01:59:37,178
Have you ever been in love?

1611
01:59:39,882 --> 01:59:41,975
Love that leads you to bed...

1612
01:59:42,218 --> 01:59:43,446
yes.

1613
01:59:44,854 --> 01:59:46,719
Love that takes away your breath...

1614
01:59:47,189 --> 01:59:48,417
no.

1615
01:59:55,231 --> 01:59:57,062
How many people have touched you?

1616
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:04,272
Many have touched me...

1617
02:00:05,908 --> 02:00:07,705
but nobody has ever touched my heart.

1618
02:00:10,713 --> 02:00:12,544
This is what happens when...

1619
02:00:13,382 --> 02:00:15,350
a boy and a girl meet,
they get close...

1620
02:00:15,451 --> 02:00:16,383
they kiss...

1621
02:00:16,485 --> 02:00:17,782
end of story.

1622
02:00:20,389 --> 02:00:22,653
I've gained infamy because of that.

1623
02:00:28,764 --> 02:00:31,232
But if this story ends
here like this, it will be...

1624
02:00:31,767 --> 02:00:33,200
Be what?

1625
02:00:37,139 --> 02:00:38,401
It'll be a sin.

1626
02:01:19,281 --> 02:01:22,148
Love is a song of the Gods

1627
02:01:22,251 --> 02:01:24,947
Love is a festival of
lights for the heart

1628
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:27,580
Love is a fragrance

1629
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:30,454
Love is a burst of morning hues

1630
02:01:30,559 --> 02:01:33,323
Love is a lilting waterfall

1631
02:01:33,395 --> 02:01:36,023
Love is a prayer

1632
02:01:36,132 --> 02:01:38,930
Love exists in every breath

1633
02:01:39,034 --> 02:01:41,366
Love lays in the eyes

1634
02:01:41,704 --> 02:01:47,233
Separate my heart from my soul

1635
02:01:47,309 --> 02:01:52,576
destroy me in love

1636
02:01:52,782 --> 02:01:55,649
make my existence

1637
02:01:55,751 --> 02:01:58,447
complete with love

1638
02:01:58,521 --> 02:02:00,887
To you

1639
02:02:00,990 --> 02:02:03,686
I surrender all my love.

1640
02:02:03,793 --> 02:02:06,489
My love is an absolute submission.

1641
02:02:06,562 --> 02:02:09,360
My love is an absolute submission.

1642
02:02:09,532 --> 02:02:11,966
To you

1643
02:02:12,034 --> 02:02:14,901
I surrender all my love.

1644
02:02:15,004 --> 02:02:17,632
My love is an absolute submission.

1645
02:02:17,740 --> 02:02:20,709
My love is an absolute submission.

1646
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:23,438
Love is a song of the Gods

1647
02:02:23,546 --> 02:02:26,174
Love is a festival of
lights for the heart

1648
02:02:26,282 --> 02:02:29,115
Love is a fragrance

1649
02:02:29,218 --> 02:02:31,812
Love is a burst of morning hues

1650
02:02:46,535 --> 02:02:51,302
I think of you in the morning

1651
02:02:52,141 --> 02:02:56,544
I think of you at dawn

1652
02:03:03,319 --> 02:03:08,188
My destiny

1653
02:03:09,024 --> 02:03:13,290
holds only your name

1654
02:03:14,663 --> 02:03:17,530
In your fire I burn

1655
02:03:17,633 --> 02:03:20,329
playing with the coal

1656
02:03:20,436 --> 02:03:22,529
In my dreams, I walk ahead

1657
02:03:22,605 --> 02:03:25,039
to tell you...

1658
02:03:25,140 --> 02:03:27,438
To you

1659
02:03:27,543 --> 02:03:30,239
I surrender all my love

1660
02:03:30,312 --> 02:03:33,008
My love is an absolute submission

1661
02:03:33,115 --> 02:03:36,107
My love is an absolute submission

1662
02:03:36,218 --> 02:03:38,618
To you

1663
02:03:38,687 --> 02:03:41,485
I surrender all my love

1664
02:03:41,590 --> 02:03:44,184
My love is an absolute submission.

1665
02:03:44,293 --> 02:03:47,319
My love is an absolute submission.

1666
02:04:06,081 --> 02:04:08,982
Walking together

1667
02:04:09,084 --> 02:04:11,780
our hands leave each others' grasp

1668
02:04:11,954 --> 02:04:15,947
Don't meet me in such paths

1669
02:04:17,526 --> 02:04:20,154
Talking

1670
02:04:20,229 --> 02:04:23,027
the night fades away

1671
02:04:23,132 --> 02:04:27,762
Meet me in those nights

1672
02:04:27,870 --> 02:04:29,132
Who am I?

1673
02:04:29,238 --> 02:04:30,603
Who is God?

1674
02:04:30,706 --> 02:04:31,934
Where you are

1675
02:04:32,041 --> 02:04:33,440
I find everything

1676
02:04:33,542 --> 02:04:34,770
Our lips meet

1677
02:04:34,877 --> 02:04:36,105
my lips blossom

1678
02:04:36,211 --> 02:04:39,044
Why should I move away?

1679
02:04:39,114 --> 02:04:41,548
To you

1680
02:04:41,617 --> 02:04:44,313
I surrender all my love.

1681
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:47,082
My love is an absolute submission.

1682
02:04:47,156 --> 02:04:50,091
My love is an absolute submission.

1683
02:04:50,192 --> 02:04:52,592
To you

1684
02:04:52,695 --> 02:04:55,391
I surrender all my love.

1685
02:04:55,497 --> 02:04:58,125
My love is an absolute submission.

1686
02:04:58,233 --> 02:05:01,600
My love is an absolute submission.

1687
02:05:17,786 --> 02:05:22,314
I'm sober, and yet
you're still beautiful.

1688
02:06:02,998 --> 02:06:06,126
Nothing else could be
worse than this, Silk.

1689
02:06:07,369 --> 02:06:10,167
Even your enemy
doesn't hate you anymore.

1690
02:06:19,381 --> 02:06:20,439
Hello?

1691
02:06:20,549 --> 02:06:21,675
Silk.

1692
02:06:22,117 --> 02:06:23,482
Who is it?

1693
02:06:23,986 --> 02:06:25,715
Who is there?

1694
02:06:25,888 --> 02:06:27,116
Who is it you want?

1695
02:06:27,222 --> 02:06:29,588
Ask, 'what do you want? '

1696
02:06:29,691 --> 02:06:30,589
My money.

1697
02:06:30,692 --> 02:06:31,920
All of it!

1698
02:06:32,294 --> 02:06:33,955
I told you I will give it back...

1699
02:06:34,063 --> 02:06:35,462
I'm not going anywhere.

1700
02:06:35,564 --> 02:06:36,895
You have my house as collateral.

1701
02:06:36,999 --> 02:06:38,261
Listen, madam!

1702
02:06:38,367 --> 02:06:41,632
As soon as I sign my next film,
I will return everything.

1703
02:06:41,737 --> 02:06:45,002
I saw your last film
and the empty theatres.

1704
02:06:45,107 --> 02:06:46,870
You think anybody
will offer you a film?

1705
02:06:46,975 --> 02:06:49,136
You have until next week...

1706
02:06:49,244 --> 02:06:50,836
or you can forget the house.

1707
02:07:11,366 --> 02:07:15,325
I had no idea that Silk
was so badly shattered.

1708
02:07:15,637 --> 02:07:18,401
She herself didn't
know what was she up to.

1709
02:07:26,982 --> 02:07:28,347
Oh great, you are here.

1710
02:07:28,450 --> 02:07:29,542
Come...

1711
02:07:29,651 --> 02:07:30,879
I've been waiting for you.

1712
02:07:30,986 --> 02:07:32,180
Come in...

1713
02:07:33,455 --> 02:07:35,719
Everything is ready for you.

1714
02:07:35,824 --> 02:07:36,688
Everything.

1715
02:07:36,792 --> 02:07:37,690
What do you mean ready?

1716
02:07:37,793 --> 02:07:38,782
What's the story?

1717
02:07:38,894 --> 02:07:40,725
Script... dialogues?

1718
02:07:41,130 --> 02:07:43,030
Story... sexy.

1719
02:07:43,532 --> 02:07:45,295
Dialogue... sexy.

1720
02:07:45,901 --> 02:07:48,233
Expression... sexy.

1721
02:07:49,404 --> 02:07:56,105
Madam, from your head to your toe,
you should only exude sex.

1722
02:08:00,082 --> 02:08:01,606
- What are you thinking about?
- I don't... I don't get it...

1723
02:08:02,584 --> 02:08:03,983
what's going on?

1724
02:08:04,319 --> 02:08:05,581
Don't worry.

1725
02:08:05,687 --> 02:08:07,086
I don't think I can do it.

1726
02:08:07,256 --> 02:08:08,985
Listen to me, please.

1727
02:08:09,324 --> 02:08:10,848
Don't be scared of them.

1728
02:08:10,959 --> 02:08:12,449
They are all junior artists.

1729
02:08:12,561 --> 02:08:14,188
But you are different.

1730
02:08:14,563 --> 02:08:15,587
They are rehearsing.

1731
02:08:15,697 --> 02:08:17,187
Come with me.

1732
02:08:17,299 --> 02:08:18,266
Have a seat.

1733
02:08:18,367 --> 02:08:20,528
I'll explain it to you.

1734
02:08:20,702 --> 02:08:24,160
We will do exactly as you say.

1735
02:08:24,439 --> 02:08:25,963
Don't worry at all.

1736
02:08:27,309 --> 02:08:28,742
Just a minute.

1737
02:08:29,411 --> 02:08:30,708
Listen madam...

1738
02:08:30,812 --> 02:08:32,871
right now I have a film...

1739
02:08:33,148 --> 02:08:34,843
and money.

1740
02:08:34,950 --> 02:08:37,475
It's yours, keep it.

1741
02:08:39,321 --> 02:08:43,223
Madam, right now you
don't have either of them.

1742
02:08:44,693 --> 02:08:46,388
What are you worried about?

1743
02:08:46,495 --> 02:08:47,587
Do it.

1744
02:08:47,696 --> 02:08:49,095
Trust me, just do it.

1745
02:08:49,398 --> 02:08:52,026
I suggest you have a drink.

1746
02:08:52,134 --> 02:08:54,830
Relax... then think about it.

1747
02:08:54,937 --> 02:08:55,926
No problem at all.

1748
02:08:56,038 --> 02:08:57,403
Drink!

1749
02:08:59,074 --> 02:09:00,268
Madam...

1750
02:09:00,375 --> 02:09:06,007
you make one film with me and I
will plant a garden of money for you.

1751
02:09:06,114 --> 02:09:10,175
And then, both money
and films will chase you!

1752
02:09:15,057 --> 02:09:15,853
Here take this...

1753
02:09:15,924 --> 02:09:17,551
don't think, just take it.

1754
02:09:17,659 --> 02:09:18,751
Come on!

1755
02:09:29,705 --> 02:09:31,104
Good.

1756
02:09:55,664 --> 02:09:58,360
Madam, we're ready for your shot.

1757
02:09:58,433 --> 02:09:59,798
Come!

1758
02:10:02,037 --> 02:10:02,765
Good.

1759
02:10:02,871 --> 02:10:03,803
Good Silk.

1760
02:10:03,905 --> 02:10:05,372
Make it sexy.

1761
02:10:29,698 --> 02:10:32,064
Police police...

1762
02:11:00,095 --> 02:11:01,892
You are Silk, right?

1763
02:11:02,564 --> 02:11:04,691
Hey, madam.

1764
02:13:37,586 --> 02:13:38,951
Why don't you freshen up...

1765
02:13:39,354 --> 02:13:42,517
If you need anything,
he will help you.

1766
02:13:43,191 --> 02:13:44,453
This way, madam.

1767
02:13:44,926 --> 02:13:46,154
Please.

1768
02:14:04,012 --> 02:14:05,604
Come on, Silk... pick up.

1769
02:14:09,484 --> 02:14:11,816
I have such a big
surprise for you... answer!

1770
02:14:36,678 --> 02:14:38,669
I haven't been able to talk to Silk.

1771
02:14:38,947 --> 02:14:40,175
I guess she's not at home.

1772
02:14:40,282 --> 02:14:41,249
Okay.

1773
02:14:41,316 --> 02:14:42,840
There's something I
need to do right now...

1774
02:14:42,951 --> 02:14:44,680
so, tomorrow I'll take you there.

1775
02:14:45,620 --> 02:14:46,882
Alright.

1776
02:14:47,289 --> 02:14:48,517
Okay.

1777
02:14:51,426 --> 02:14:55,157
'Congrats! What a film!
Brilliant acting! '

1778
02:14:55,630 --> 02:14:57,359
Everybody had words of praise.

1779
02:14:57,699 --> 02:14:59,758
The buttons of my shirt gave way...

1780
02:15:00,035 --> 02:15:02,435
my chest was so puffed up with pride!

1781
02:15:03,371 --> 02:15:05,305
Then what was I missing?

1782
02:15:05,874 --> 02:15:07,466
I was at the party...

1783
02:15:08,076 --> 02:15:09,634
but my thoughts were elsewhere...

1784
02:15:10,278 --> 02:15:11,506
Silk...

1785
02:15:12,147 --> 02:15:13,910
Silk... Silk... Silk...

1786
02:15:14,816 --> 02:15:17,478
Her name kept ringing in my mind.

1787
02:15:17,953 --> 02:15:19,181
But she...

1788
02:15:19,788 --> 02:15:21,517
she wasn't even answering her phone!

1789
02:15:34,035 --> 02:15:34,899
Hello?

1790
02:15:35,003 --> 02:15:36,493
There's something strange about you.

1791
02:15:37,205 --> 02:15:39,469
When I ignored you,
I bumped into you everywhere.

1792
02:15:39,808 --> 02:15:41,673
Now when I want to see you...

1793
02:15:41,776 --> 02:15:43,539
you decide to vanish.

1794
02:15:45,046 --> 02:15:47,480
Abraham, do yourself a favour.

1795
02:15:47,582 --> 02:15:49,482
Find yourself someone nice.

1796
02:15:49,851 --> 02:15:51,216
Listen...

1797
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:54,185
I have a big surprise for you.

1798
02:15:54,623 --> 02:15:57,057
You want to sign me for your film?

1799
02:15:58,193 --> 02:15:59,683
Even better.

1800
02:16:00,095 --> 02:16:01,357
I'm waiting.

1801
02:16:01,429 --> 02:16:02,623
Right now...

1802
02:16:02,731 --> 02:16:06,758
I'm stuck at a boring
party with boring people.

1803
02:16:06,868 --> 02:16:08,165
Who is there?

1804
02:16:08,269 --> 02:16:09,634
The usual suspects.

1805
02:16:09,738 --> 02:16:13,674
Suryakant, Ramakant,
Venkat, Vijayan, Selva Ganesh...

1806
02:16:15,377 --> 02:16:18,175
Tell them I've said 'bye'.

1807
02:16:19,681 --> 02:16:20,909
Where are you going?

1808
02:16:22,450 --> 02:16:23,917
To bed.

1809
02:16:25,654 --> 02:16:27,212
I'm very sleepy.

1810
02:16:27,322 --> 02:16:28,949
See you in the morning.

1811
02:16:29,224 --> 02:16:31,215
Promise. I'll see you.

1812
02:16:43,304 --> 02:16:44,464
Abraham sir...

1813
02:16:44,572 --> 02:16:45,561
it's your party.

1814
02:16:45,674 --> 02:16:46,641
We were looking for you.

1815
02:16:46,741 --> 02:16:47,765
You just vanished.

1816
02:16:47,876 --> 02:16:49,241
Where were you?

1817
02:16:49,811 --> 02:16:51,244
I was talking to Silk.

1818
02:16:53,648 --> 02:16:56,617
The bus isn't moving, then
why are you running after it?

1819
02:16:57,252 --> 02:16:58,947
She's worthless.

1820
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:00,685
You can talk to her anytime.

1821
02:17:00,789 --> 02:17:02,188
Enjoy the party.

1822
02:17:02,624 --> 02:17:04,717
What did she have to say?

1823
02:17:06,428 --> 02:17:07,861
She said bye to all of you.

1824
02:17:08,263 --> 02:17:09,423
Is she going somewhere?

1825
02:17:09,531 --> 02:17:11,192
It's the right thing to do, Ramakant.

1826
02:17:12,300 --> 02:17:14,097
She should go away.

1827
02:17:15,470 --> 02:17:17,938
There's nothing left for her anymore.

1828
02:18:50,732 --> 02:18:51,960
Silk!

1829
02:18:57,438 --> 02:18:58,837
Silk!

1830
02:19:23,731 --> 02:19:24,959
Silk!

1831
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:27,133
Silk!

1832
02:20:03,471 --> 02:20:07,237
When life becomes miserable,
that's when you begin to understand it.

1833
02:20:08,343 --> 02:20:13,303
And a million questions arise to
which you will never get the answers.

1834
02:20:14,515 --> 02:20:17,609
Why didn't mother hug me as
soon as she opened the door?

1835
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:20,617
Why didn't I realise that...

1836
02:20:20,722 --> 02:20:25,056
worshipping a star and loving a
star are two different things.

1837
02:20:26,728 --> 02:20:28,821
The person whom you taught
to stand up for himself...

1838
02:20:28,930 --> 02:20:30,864
why didn't he stand up for you?

1839
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:37,795
Everybody wanted to feel me,
why didn't anybody hold my hand?

1840
02:20:40,275 --> 02:20:43,506
You can hear the
pages turn in a library.

1841
02:20:44,445 --> 02:20:47,710
You can even hear
honking in a 'silence' zone.

1842
02:20:48,516 --> 02:20:52,850
But when ears that are accustomed to
applause fail to hear the abuses...

1843
02:20:52,921 --> 02:20:56,948
life begins to
resemble an empty theatre.

1844
02:21:03,631 --> 02:21:07,192
I don't know whether
Silk was right or wrong?

1845
02:21:07,902 --> 02:21:10,769
The matters in a person's
life runs for really long.

1846
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:14,500
But the judgements
are passed up there.

1847
02:21:15,476 --> 02:21:16,875
Up there.

1848
02:21:19,747 --> 02:21:22,545
Silk must be creating an
uproar up there as well.

1849
02:22:13,801 --> 02:22:17,703
Ooh la la, Ooh la la,
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

1850
02:22:17,805 --> 02:22:21,502
You are my fantasy

1851
02:22:21,609 --> 02:22:25,409
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

1852
02:22:25,513 --> 02:22:28,573
I am a young lady now

1853
02:22:28,683 --> 02:22:32,983
Ooh la la, Ooh la la,
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

1854
02:22:33,087 --> 02:22:36,523
You are my fantasy

1855
02:22:36,624 --> 02:22:40,560
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

1856
02:22:40,661 --> 02:22:44,620
I am a young lady now

1857
02:23:10,258 --> 02:23:12,783
When touched by you

1858
02:23:12,860 --> 02:23:14,657
my heart whistled

1859
02:23:14,762 --> 02:23:18,323
Give me a sweet
kiss on my cheeks

1860
02:23:18,433 --> 02:23:20,401
When touched by you

1861
02:23:20,501 --> 02:23:22,128
my heart whistled

1862
02:23:22,203 --> 02:23:26,071
Give me a sweet
kiss on my cheeks

1863
02:23:26,174 --> 02:23:29,769
Your youth, is fluid

1864
02:23:29,877 --> 02:23:33,574
which has drenched my heart

1865
02:23:33,681 --> 02:23:35,649
Aha you brought the rain

1866
02:23:35,750 --> 02:23:39,709
what could my poor youth do?

1867
02:23:39,821 --> 02:23:43,450
Ooh la la, Ooh la la,
Ooh la la, Ooh la la

1868
02:23:43,558 --> 02:23:45,890
You are my fantasy

1869
02:23:45,993 --> 02:23:47,392
No no no no no

1870
02:23:47,495 --> 02:23:51,090
Don't touch me, Don't touch me,
Don't touch me, Don't touch me

1871
02:23:51,199 --> 02:23:55,135
I am a young lady now

1872
02:24:17,291 --> 02:24:20,727
By dropping your saree

1873
02:24:20,795 --> 02:24:24,925
repeatedly

1874
02:24:25,032 --> 02:24:32,302
you make me restless

1875
02:24:32,373 --> 02:24:35,900
By dropping your saree

1876
02:24:36,010 --> 02:24:39,878
repeatedly

1877
02:24:40,414 --> 02:24:47,217
you make me restless

1878
02:24:47,321 --> 02:24:50,017
After storming a fire in me

1879
02:24:50,091 --> 02:24:53,060
what can the poor saree do

1880
02:24:53,161 --> 02:24:54,992
Poor thing

1881
02:24:55,096 --> 02:24:57,690
Oh poor thing

1882
02:24:57,765 --> 02:25:00,791
I will tease you

1883
02:25:00,902 --> 02:25:03,769
you are a bombastic girl

1884
02:25:03,871 --> 02:25:05,532
Oh no.
