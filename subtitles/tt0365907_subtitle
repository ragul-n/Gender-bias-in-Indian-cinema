1
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,204
- You need some help, man.
- Oh, God.

2
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,060
I don't care.

3
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,725
You want to mess up your own shit.

4
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,729
But you're going to mess up mine, too.

5
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,540
I need to know you got my back.

6
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,860
Not that you're going to come falling
through the door behind me...

7
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,401
Don't worry your pretty
little spic head off.

8
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,460
Anyway. That was all I wanted to say.

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,761
Is that it?

10
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,881
Fuck you.

11
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,641
Scudder.

12
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,500
Remember us?

13
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,060
Okay, get out. Both of you.

14
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,441
I told you last night that we...

15
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,130
Oh, my God!

16
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,530
Is everybody okay?

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,406
Get down!

18
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,660
Get behind me! Get down!

19
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,740
Move it!

20
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,166
- Stay low!
- Duck inside!

21
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,327
Hey, Matt.

22
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,566
It's me, Peter.

23
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,660
You know, Peter Kristo...

24
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,564
Oh, Peter. Hi.

25
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,605
Do I know you, Peter?

26
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,886
Yeah, I led a meeting a few weeks ago.

27
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,924
You know, I'm a painter,

28
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,020
got hooked on smack in art school...

29
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,060
Oh, yeah.

30
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,060
You're the guy did the
Jackson Pollock number

31
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,060
on the wall of the john
with the blood from your...

32
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,660
- Syringe.
- Yeah.

33
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,740
- Yeah, that was me.
- I enjoyed your story.

34
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,520
Oh! Thanks. Appreciate it.

35
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,060
Do you mind?

36
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,805
Sure, sit down.

37
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,600
Can't smoke in here, honey.

38
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,460
- Yeah.
- Something wrong, Peter?

39
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,283
It's my brother, you know?
He needs your help.

40
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,531
What kind of help?

41
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,420
I think it would be better if
you came out to Clinton Hill,

42
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,060
talked about it there with him.

43
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,500
Clinton Hill.

44
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,300
Yeah, he'll pay for your cab out
there and back, and your time.

45
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,728
Whether you take it or not.

46
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,380
Please, just hear what he got
to say, that's all I'm asking.

47
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,808
When does your brother
want to have this chat?

48
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,244
Well, you know. Right now.

49
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,780
That's what I was afraid
you were gonna say.

50
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,540
- Here you go, Matt.
- Thanks, Jenny.

51
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,080
Yeah, I'm sorry.

52
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,900
You're eating.

53
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,850
I'll come back.

54
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,884
Yeah, if you're...

55
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,967
Jenny, would you keep this warm
for me, please? I'll be back.

56
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,809
Half an hour, right there on the right.

57
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,761
That's it. Yeah,
it's a nice place, right?

58
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,860
All right, Mr. Matt. Go on up.

59
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,969
Kenny don't like me smoking
in the house, so...

60
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,805
Hey, Kenny.

61
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,327
Mr. Scudder. Come in.

62
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,420
Can I get you something to drink?

63
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,530
Not a "drink" drink, I know
you know Peter from AA,

64
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,740
but there's coffee made,
or I can offer you a soda.

65
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,060
I'm fine.

66
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,620
So you're a private detective,
is that right?

67
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,922
- Unlicensed.
- What's that mean?

68
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,340
It means that sometimes
I do favors for people,

69
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,325
and sometimes, in return,
they give me gifts.

70
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,924
Gifts. But you used
to be a cop, right?

71
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,526
Yeah, I was with the 6th Precinct
in the Village for a while.

72
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,580
And before that, I was
over here with the 75th.

73
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,769
So why'd you quit?

74
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,180
I didn't like the hours, Mr. Kristo.

75
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,642
Nah, the corruption got to you, huh?

76
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,220
Not really.

77
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,524
It would have been hard to
support my family without it.

78
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,884
So, what can I do for you?

79
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,900
Well, this was really my brother's idea,

80
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,362
you know, bringing you out here.

81
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,380
You want, I can leave.

82
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,806
Someone's kidnapped my wife.

83
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,660
That's a federal matter.

84
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,300
They said not to call the cops.

85
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,728
Naturally they would.
When did this happen?

86
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,060
Yesterday.

87
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,660
You should be talking to the FBI.

88
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,500
- I'm talking to you.
- Look, Mr. Kristo...

89
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,529
- Kenny.
- Kenny.

90
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,180
If you're asking me to run
a bag, deliver money,

91
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,540
that is not something I do.

92
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,046
I already paid them.

93
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,401
When?

94
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,161
Last night.

95
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,540
How much?

96
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,887
$400,000.

97
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,731
And your wife? Where is she?

98
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,845
She's dead.

99
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,128
I paid them, but they killed her anyway.

100
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,924
I see.

101
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,820
- I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

102
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,329
I want you to find the men who
did this and bring them to me.

103
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,780
You say you paid them
the 400 the same day?

104
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,081
That's right.

105
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,567
You mind if I ask what kind
of business you're in, Kenny?

106
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,286
Construction.

107
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,060
What exactly do you construct?

108
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,140
Houses.

109
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,441
Oh.

110
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,161
Then I guess Peter's standing
outside right now because he what?

111
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,962
Doesn't like your building methods?

112
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,580
Peter's not supposed to
associate with people like me.

113
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,940
People in my profession.

114
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,641
Since when is drug dealing a profession?

115
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,448
I mean, that's the reason, isn't it?

116
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,121
I'm sitting here and not the cops?
You're a dealer.

117
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,980
Properly speaking, I'm more
of a trafficker than a dealer.

118
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,009
You understand the distinction.

119
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,327
I really don't give a shit
one way or the other.

120
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,260
But whoever it was took your wife

121
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,086
didn't just pick your name out of a hat.

122
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,300
They must have had some idea
you had that kind of cash on hand.

123
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,420
That's exactly what I
want you to find out.

124
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,370
Who did this?

125
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,260
Now there's $20,000.

126
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,060
Consider it my gift to you.

127
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,886
There's 20 more, you find
the two fucks who killed her.

128
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,044
So that you can kill them.

129
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,123
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

130
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,580
Woulda been nice, you told
me what your brother was.

131
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,900
Yeah, you wouldn'ta come.

132
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,645
That's right. I wouldn't have.

133
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,364
I stopped drinking that day.

134
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,442
Just wasn't as much fun after that.

135
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,567
Well, I guess I'm just a...

136
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,564
Anyway, I'm eight years sober.

137
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,968
And I... Well...

138
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,403
That's all. Thanks.

139
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,241
Howie.

140
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,860
Hurt yourself?

141
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,940
Found it out back by the dumpster.

142
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,220
Mrs. Dolgren in 202

143
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,921
left it there when Mr. D
stroked out last week.

144
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,761
Any messages?

145
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,444
I never told you her name.

146
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,771
I don't want you to think that I'm cruel

147
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,445
or don't care.

148
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,885
I just can't say it.

149
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,041
What happened?

150
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,980
Hey

151
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,281
Hello?

152
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,660
Carrie Anne, what's your game now?

153
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,820
Hello?

154
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,804
She never came home, right?

155
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,180
Excuse me?

156
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,164
We've got your wife, fucko.

157
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,566
Carrie?

158
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,166
Carrie?

159
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,925
Baby, you up there?

160
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,401
What is it you want?

161
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,740
We want to help you get your wife back.
If you want her back, that is.

162
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,140
Of course I want her back.

163
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,060
Good. Then stay by the phone,

164
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,321
don't call the police,
and we'll be in touch. Very soon.

165
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,980
It was maybe 10 minutes
before they called again.

166
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,282
How much does your
wife weigh, Mr. Kristo?

167
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,300
110, 120?
Somewhere in that neighborhood?

168
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,365
Something like 50 kilograms,
you might say?

169
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,969
Now 50 keys, at 20 a key,
run the numbers for me.

170
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,371
Comes out to a million, doesn't it?

171
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,367
What's your point?

172
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,846
My point?

173
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,204
My point is that you'd pay a million
for her if she were product.

174
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,100
If she was powder, Mr. Kristo.

175
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,340
Isn't she worth as much
to you in flesh and blood?

176
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,220
I can't pay what I don't have.

177
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,204
How much do you have?

178
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,420
Four hundred.

179
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,580
Five.

180
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,460
I'm not haggling. I gave you
the top figure right away.

181
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,761
It's 400.

182
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,241
Oh, well.

183
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,006
That's the best you can do.
Okay. Four hundred it is.

184
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,180
Before I give you anything, I want
to make sure my wife is all right.

185
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,820
Well, that's impossible.
I'm at a pay phone.

186
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,940
How do I even know you've
got her in the first place?

187
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,620
Are you familiar with her tits?

188
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,780
Excuse me?

189
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,460
They're quite nice. Would
you recognize one of them?

190
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,445
That would be the easiest way.
I could cut one off.

191
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,620
The one with the cute little mole on it.

192
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,140
And I'll leave it on your doorstep.

193
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,660
- Would that put your mind at rest?
- Jesus, don't say that.

194
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,601
All right, then let's not talk
any more about proof, okay?

195
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,927
Put the money in two hefty bags.

196
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,780
Go to the corner of
Columbia and Commerce

197
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,970
to the pay phone and wait for my call.

198
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,881
Hello.

199
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,060
Where's the money?

200
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,362
In the back seat.
Two bags, like you said.

201
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,123
Good. Now leave it.
Walk up Columbia to Richards Street.

202
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,961
And then what?

203
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,180
Wait on the corner for five minutes,

204
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,370
then walk back,
get in your car and go home.

205
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,125
Well, what about my wife?

206
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,122
She'll be in the car waiting for you.

207
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,000
Carrie?

208
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,441
Fuck.

209
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,660
And they run me around, then finally

210
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,406
they tell me she's at home, waiting for me.

211
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,580
I go home and she's not there either.

212
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,086
Carrie!

213
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,860
The phone rings again.

214
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,321
Fuck!

215
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,681
Where is she?

216
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,048
They send me over to Red Hook.

217
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,528
Tell me she's in the trunk
of this abandoned car.

218
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,246
They taped this to the
inside of the trunk

219
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,882
with a note that said
"for your listening pleasure."

220
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,610
That's my number.

221
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,161
It's okay.

222
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,526
Look at these. Look at these.

223
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,002
I touch them and the nipples get hard.

224
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,601
You get hot even when
you're scared, don't you?

225
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,485
And kiss me.

226
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,566
Yeah. Come on,
let's take the tape off of her.

227
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,085
Hey, Carrie Anne

228
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,721
Can anybody...

229
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,041
Yes?

230
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,805
Where in Red Hook?

231
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,860
She tipped me $2, which is twice

232
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,527
what anybody else tips,
if they even tip at all.

233
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,940
You mentioned a van.

234
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,480
Yeah. It was parked right there.

235
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,660
Two guys got out of it.

236
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,220
I remember they checked
her out pretty good.

237
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,329
They were both dressed the same,
some kind of uniform.

238
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,004
They pulled out after Mrs. Kristo,

239
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,846
cut off a Caddy.

240
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,449
- You remember what the van looked like?
- Yeah.

241
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,771
It was light blue.
It was definitely light blue.

242
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,540
I could tell she was a good cook.

243
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,500
Nothing frozen in her cart.

244
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,100
She said she was making kunafa, so I sent
her to the Lebanese place down the block.

245
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,020
Yeah, the van was
parked across the street.

246
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,860
I thought they were making a delivery.

247
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,260
I don't remember a van.

248
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,020
I do remember the pita maker,
Mrs. Youness, came in

249
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,403
and was all like, "Oh, what happened?
Are we okay?"

250
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,940
She saw two men and a woman

251
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,700
run across the street away from
the store and leap into a van.

252
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,940
She thought they had
just robbed the store.

253
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,180
Two men?

254
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,900
Yeah.

255
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,540
I think it had the name of a
TV repair place on the side.

256
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,446
Two initials, like B & R TV.

257
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,481
For sure. J & M Heating.

258
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,620
R & L Stereo.

259
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,763
B & A Appliance.

260
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,450
TJ, I'd like a word with you.

261
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,771
Now, please.

262
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,650
I know you've been sleeping here.

263
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,161
Shit.

264
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,780
I know because Mr. Keyser

265
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,845
says you left a god-awful
mess in the men's room.

266
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,684
Not to mention the
mess you've left here.

267
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,220
TJ, you've got to...

268
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,410
He'll clean it up later, okay?

269
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,407
Right now he's helping
me with something.

270
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,724
You get back issues of all the
New York papers on there?

271
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,601
For what?

272
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,641
Naw, I'm good.

273
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,606
Can see from right here.

274
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,060
Not the first old
white dude, come in here,

275
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,600
try to put a hand on me.

276
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,241
Okay.

277
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,721
Child of God.

278
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,121
What?

279
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,460
The name. Gotteskind.
It means "child of God."

280
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,761
It's German.

281
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,649
Except, clearly, God never
looked out for Marie.

282
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,762
TJ? That short for something?

283
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,209
Yeah, it's short for "TJ."

284
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,660
You 5-0?

285
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,860
Nope.

286
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,241
'Cause you've got that look.

287
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,561
I work private.

288
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,460
Yeah? Like Sam Spade?

289
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,091
Yeah, just like him.

290
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,340
What I'm saying is, I read about him.
And Marlowe, too.

291
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,860
All of those guys.

292
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,340
You spend that much time in here?

293
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,500
Some. Mostly when it rains.

294
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,290
Just like the sound it makes, you know?

295
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,601
Matt.

296
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,801
Short for Matthew.

297
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,764
So why you looking at
dead bitches, Matthew?

298
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,540
So these guys we're
looking for, they be like

299
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,020
real 730, or just, like, thugs?

300
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,401
Like real what?

301
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,407
730. It's the time they give
out the meds in a mental ward.

302
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,689
Right. 730.

303
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,020
Can that program go back another year?

304
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,687
Listen to you. "That program."

305
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,620
Take you maybe a minute to figure out

306
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,366
how to work Yahoo all by yourself.

307
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,780
Why bother?

308
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,700
From what I hear, it's all
going to shit in six months.

309
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,780
Please, please, man.

310
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,540
I got way more important things to do

311
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,525
than worry about all that Y2K bullshit.

312
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,846
How ironical.

313
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,540
What's that?

314
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,366
Dumping an already dead
body at a cemetery.

315
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,700
Tuesday. The body of Leila Andresen

316
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,740
a 25-year-old Interior Design
major at Brooklyn College

317
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,980
was found at Green-Wood Cemetery.

318
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,363
Andresen had been missing two
days when Eduardo Solomon,

319
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,780
florist across the street
from the cemetery,

320
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,260
found what was later identified
as a portion of the victim's leg

321
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,130
in the dumpster behind his shop.

322
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,180
That same day,
more human remains were found

323
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,211
scattered about the cemetery
by a groundskeeper.

324
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,020
Witnesses say Andresen was last seen

325
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,448
getting into a blue van with three men.

326
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,500
Andresen's fiancé, Reuben Quintana,

327
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,644
told police that he and Leila were
supposed to meet up for lunch.

328
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,006
But she never showed.

329
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,961
Good guess.

330
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,691
Thanks for your help.

331
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,288
- What's this?
- What's what?

332
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,570
My time is valuable, man.

333
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,570
How valuable?

334
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,845
Ten bucks.

335
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,009
Here's $20. Take it easy.

336
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,886
I'm going to go get something to eat.

337
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,520
Want a hamburger or something?

338
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,601
I don't eat meat.

339
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,900
Oh.

340
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,680
Okay. Nice meeting you, TJ.

341
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,802
What I'm saying is,
I don't care nothing about cows.

342
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,300
I just care about what
I put inside my body.

343
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,968
No meat, no soda, no Pringles,
none of that shit.

344
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,340
But I was thinking about getting
a little eat on myself.

345
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,962
All right. So we can both
get our eat ons together.

346
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,361
Come on.

347
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,280
Come on, Watson.

348
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,446
Where do you sleep?

349
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,002
Those nights you can't
hide in the library?

350
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,170
There's places to stay.

351
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,770
What happened to your parents?

352
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,364
You don't gotta feel sorry for me.

353
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,081
I don't.

354
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,681
Good.

355
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,300
You could hire me, though.
Make me your partner.

356
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,220
I don't think so.

357
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,740
Why? You don't think I got what
it takes to be a good detective?

358
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,884
I'm sure you do.
I'm just not the partner type.

359
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,820
What does it take to be a
good detective anyway?

360
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,281
A strong bladder.

361
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,241
Seriously.

362
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,045
I don't know what it takes.

363
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,807
I don't know. Patience. Instincts.
Blind luck, mostly.

364
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,620
And a good name.
A good name is very important.

365
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,940
One with real flavor like Sam
Spade or Philip Marlowe.

366
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,100
What's wrong with the name you got?

367
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,940
I don't know, man.

368
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,049
Thinking something more like

369
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,291
Daunte Culpepper.

370
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,660
Quarterback for Minnesota?

371
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,740
It's a good name for a detective,

372
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,441
but a lame-ass name for
a guy who plays football.

373
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,250
Daunte Culpepper.

374
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,841
Yeah. Daunte Culpepper. Private eye.

375
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,524
Now I like that name a lot.

376
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,522
Sure you don't want a
soda or something, honey?

377
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,020
I know you just love to give a
young black man like myself

378
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,580
one of your sperm-killer sodas.

379
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,281
But no thank you, ma'am.
I'll just stick with the water.

380
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,260
What? They only give sodas
to low-income people.

381
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,660
With a bunch of chemicals
in them to sterilize you.

382
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,340
That's why I only drink water.

383
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,369
A gallon a day and stay hydrated.

384
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,201
You don't eat meat?

385
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,500
Yeah. So what.
You got a problem with that?

386
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,326
Not at all. My ex-wife,
she was vegetarian.

387
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,603
So what happened? Why'd you split?

388
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,980
What was she? A clucker?

389
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,060
A what?

390
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,900
A clucker. Chickenhead.

391
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,140
You know, those females
that only like you

392
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,420
if you give them nice things.

393
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,882
If you ain't bling-blinging,
you ain't seeing shit.

394
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,480
Can't you speak English?

395
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,008
Hit a nerve. Sorry.

396
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,405
Wait a minute. What time is it?

397
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,300
- Almost 10:00.
- Shit.

398
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,300
I gotta get back to the shelter.
It closes at 10:00.

399
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,125
Thanks for the pancakes.

400
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,681
Jonas Loogan?

401
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,340
Yes?

402
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,926
You're the gardener here?

403
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,924
I'm the groundskeeper. Can I help you?

404
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,328
- I'm Matthew Scudder.
- Whoa!

405
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,340
That was fast.
Public affairs lady at the 77th

406
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,688
said it would be at least a week
before anyone got back to me.

407
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,900
Excuse me?

408
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,940
I just really want the book to
have an authentic feel, you know?

409
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,020
Book?

410
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,060
That's why this ride along is
so important to me, you know?

411
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,805
Spend some real time with real cops?

412
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,780
What do you want?

413
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,401
I was hoping I could talk to
you about Leila Andresen.

414
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,401
Who?

415
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,529
The woman they found over here.

416
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,620
Yeah, I don't know anything about that.

417
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,161
Your boss tells me you
were here that day.

418
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,460
- You spoke to Larry?
- Yeah.

419
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,127
Great. 'Cause my boss is Gretchen, okay?

420
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,208
Oh, boy. I messed up.

421
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,441
You're too smart for me, Jonas. Damn.

422
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,846
Think you can help me anyway?

423
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,289
Already told everything
I know to the police.

424
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,420
Eduardo. Guy who owns
the shop across the street,

425
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,340
says there were about 20
garbage bags that were here.

426
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,420
That true?

427
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,420
Eduardo was wrong.
There were only about 10.

428
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,780
And most of those were
on the Fifth Avenue side.

429
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,367
And there were four more
floating in the pond down there.

430
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,331
So you saw them?

431
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,850
I saw the pigeon first.

432
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,410
Keep a coop on my roof.

433
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,500
This was a Helmet.

434
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,620
It was alone.

435
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,460
Which, if you know anything
at all about Helmets,

436
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,340
is quite unusual for that breed.

437
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,820
It was sitting on one of the bags

438
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,300
trying to get at whatever was in there.

439
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,940
I just fished them both
out after I was done

440
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,300
with the mowing and threw them away.

441
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,726
You didn't open them?

442
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,140
No. I figured it was all
just some waterlogged trash

443
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,060
that kids had thrown in
there the night before.

444
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,860
They do that, you know?

445
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,367
Throw their rubbers and their
empties into the pond.

446
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,820
You see the cops across the street?

447
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,660
Yeah, but I didn't make that connection

448
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,220
until Vince came running over
from the Fifth Avenue entrance.

449
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,700
Vince.

450
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,740
Yeah, he's the other groundskeeper.

451
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,300
He's the one that found
the bags over there.

452
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,460
Is Vince around?
I'd like to talk to him.

453
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,761
He quit.

454
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,010
He opened one of the bags.

455
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,680
You know, I was just starting
to forget about her.

456
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,820
Thank you so much for
bringing that all back.

457
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,180
What's your book about?

458
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,284
Don't patronize me.

459
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,460
Yo, Matt, what's the dealie, man?

460
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,500
Hello, TJ.

461
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,660
You know I been shadowing you.

462
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,820
No kidding.

463
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,460
Aiight. So, "I followed subject back

464
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,649
"from dinner to a meeting
at some church."

465
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,485
Used to drink some, huh?

466
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,180
"I then followed subject back to
some shitty-assed building on 45th

467
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,580
"where subject remained until..."

468
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,450
I know where I was, TJ.

469
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,700
You made me at that
flower shop, didn't you?

470
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,660
I made you back at the subway.

471
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,860
Damn.

472
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,860
This book I'm reading
says a foot tail is hard

473
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,980
to do on account of
they're so easy to spot.

474
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,140
That it is.

475
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,820
It says it's good to use three guys.

476
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,340
Two alternating behind and another
guy on the other side of the street.

477
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,290
Sure. If you have three guys.

478
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,380
You know you spend a lot of time

479
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,540
at churches and you use
a lot of payphones.

480
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,980
So?

481
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,380
So you don't got no cell phone?

482
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,460
I don't like them.

483
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,660
You don't like computers and
you don't like cell phones.

484
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,486
Fucking Amish got more flavor
than you do, Matthew.

485
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,660
You know, I watched
you follow some dude,

486
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,180
you didn't even try to hide or nothing.

487
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,780
He wasn't looking for me.

488
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,481
Funny. Me following you while
you following some other guy.

489
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,691
It's real ironical.

490
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,140
- TJ?
- Yeah?

491
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,521
Stop following me.

492
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,647
Okay. No. No.

493
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,340
Reuben Quintana?

494
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,641
I help you with something?

495
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,260
My name is Matt Scudder.

496
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,580
I was wondering if I could talk
to you about your fiancée?

497
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,820
- Fiancée?
- Leila Andresen?

498
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,540
Oh. Leila.

499
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,380
You know, I kind of have this
other place I have to be...

500
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,761
I'll just be a minute.

501
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,881
Yeah, okay.

502
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,721
Yeah, come on in.

503
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,060
I get you something to drink?

504
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,771
No, thank you.

505
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,569
It must be nice, have the time to
work out in the middle of the day.

506
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,100
I'd rather be working.

507
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,880
Period. I'm an actor.

508
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,300
Yeah, I thought you looked familiar.

509
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,220
Have I seen something you've been in?

510
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,020
Maybe. I did a Stetson commercial.

511
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,100
Few years back.

512
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,140
Stetson, the hat?

513
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,441
No, the cologne.

514
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,220
- Oh.
- Ran during the Stanley Cup Finals.

515
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,965
Missed that one.

516
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,083
Leila went to Brooklyn College,
is that right?

517
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,460
Studied decorating?

518
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,091
Interior design.

519
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,401
Right.

520
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,980
You told the police that
it was three men took her.

521
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,100
Yeah, that's right.

522
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,420
You're sure about that?

523
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,449
Yeah. I saw them.

524
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,460
I was at this coffee
place on Prospect...

525
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,660
She used to meet me there sometimes.

526
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,123
...when I see two guys jump
out of the van and grab her.

527
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,521
What'd they look like?

528
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,100
I couldn't really see their faces.

529
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,607
But I could see a third
guy behind the wheel.

530
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,801
Move!

531
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,728
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

532
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,201
That's the last time I saw her.

533
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,646
This is a nice place.

534
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,260
Lots of nice stuff.

535
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,820
Leila do the design?

536
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,407
Yeah. You should see
the bedroom, it's...

537
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,604
Wait, I... That didn't sound right.

538
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,460
You don't deal, do you, Reuben?

539
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,180
- What?
- You heard me.

540
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,500
You asking, am I a drug dealer?

541
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,211
Unless you prefer trafficker.

542
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,100
Or maybe you wanna tell me you made

543
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,180
your money peddling cologne on ESPN.

544
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,481
I got a trust fund.

545
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,260
- From your rich family up in the Bronx?
- Yeah.

546
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,940
My mom won a lawsuit a few years back.

547
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,847
Hey, come on, Reuben, not even the
dog's dumb enough to buy that one.

548
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,580
Look, I don't care how
you earn your living.

549
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,565
But the guys who grabbed Leila?
They might have.

550
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,001
How do you mean?

551
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,220
How do you mean?

552
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,646
Thanks for your time.

553
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,851
Thank you.

554
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,484
Jonas? Did you forget your key again?

555
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,100
What the hell is going on?
Cops showing up

556
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,140
to my house asking about Leila.

557
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,851
Who the hell is this guy?

558
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,727
"He carried her through the field,

559
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,122
"the dandelions and cattails
still wet with morning dew,

560
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,405
"and set her down by a stream,

561
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,729
"whispering through the strands
of her fine yellow hair,

562
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,250
"'You're safe now. You're safe."'

563
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,641
Fuck.

564
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,841
Jonas.

565
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,681
You caught me.

566
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,606
You gave the cops a
different address, didn't you?

567
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,527
That's why they never put you
across the street from Leila.

568
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,860
This is my mother's building.

569
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,180
I live in Sunset Park, but I'm not
allowed to keep my birds there.

570
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,403
Even though there's room on the roof.

571
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,820
Your mom home right now? Maybe we could

572
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,963
go down and talk, have a cup of coffee.

573
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,405
I can't let you leave here.

574
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,660
They'll kill me if I do.

575
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,060
Who's "they," Jonas?

576
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,361
The other two.

577
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,924
So what, you gonna stab me
now with that big fucking knife?

578
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,620
It's gonna bother me, too.
For a long time, I know it will.

579
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,980
How much is it gonna bother you

580
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,647
I take that knife away
and stick it in your neck?

581
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,767
Could you really do that?

582
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,340
Yeah, I really could.

583
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,005
But I'd rather not.

584
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,246
How about instead we trade?

585
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,220
Okay.

586
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,521
Set it down.

587
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,820
What was it I said that gave me away?

588
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,646
Everything. You're a weirdo, Jonas.

589
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,247
I never laid a hand on Leila.

590
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,900
But the other two, they're the
ones you better worry about.

591
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,440
What other two?

592
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,321
Jonas.

593
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,250
What other two?

594
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,806
They're not human.

595
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,726
How'd you meet them?

596
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,601
There's this video store near my house.

597
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,124
They've got this basement where they
keep some of the more specialized stuff.

598
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,125
Always came in together.

599
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,280
You wouldn't really notice
them unless they spoke to you.

600
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,129
One of them had a beard, or a goatee.

601
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,009
The other one smiled a lot.
He did all the talking.

602
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,721
What about names?

603
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,164
You don't exchange names
in a place like that.

604
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,841
Not real ones anyway.

605
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,860
They loved that I worked in a cemetery.
Thought it was funny.

606
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,161
Wanted to buy me drinks.

607
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,020
So we went to this bar
in the middle of the day.

608
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,860
Drank rum and Coke.

609
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,220
Talked about the different
videos we liked.

610
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,380
It was all one big laugh to them,

611
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,020
watching all the drug
addicts fuck each other.

612
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,540
They were, like,
obsessed with that whole world.

613
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,207
Dealers, addicts,
different kinds of drugs.

614
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,650
They told me they worked with the DEA.

615
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,041
They were cops?

616
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,691
They wouldn't say for sure.

617
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,525
They said what they did was secret.

618
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,802
But they had one of those
police radios, you know?

619
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,180
One of those handheld units.

620
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,780
And they had all these files on drug
dealers with DEA stamps on them.

621
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,969
Told me they worked on
special assignments.

622
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,526
You told them about Reuben.

623
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,128
I told them about Leila.

624
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,729
About how I wanted to
save her from Reuben.

625
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,767
So we came up here.
We watched them for a while.

626
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,727
They said they wanted to help her, too.

627
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,420
So you followed her?

628
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,926
You picked her up off the street.

629
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,580
Then what?

630
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,980
We drove around with her.
We finally parked somewhere.

631
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,520
Near the water in Brooklyn.

632
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,922
Said they wanted to
make their own video.

633
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,140
She was really scared.

634
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,566
They loved that.

635
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,409
You dirty little girl.

636
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,405
They kept talking to her.

637
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,410
Pick one. Which one's your favorite?

638
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,300
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.

639
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,649
You pick the one that you want
to keep, and I'll take the other.

640
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,761
One for you, one for me.
That's fair, isn't it?

641
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,131
Well, you better pick one,
or I'm going to take them both.

642
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,340
Come on, what are you waiting for?
You trying to stall?

643
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,801
You trying to make me mad?

644
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,402
Touch the one that you want to keep.

645
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,721
This one?

646
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,121
Okay, good.

647
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,820
I think that's an excellent choice.

648
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,806
Okay, that's ones yours,
and this one is mine.

649
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,284
A deal's a deal. No take backsies.

650
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,086
But then two days later, I think
they thought it would be funny,

651
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,290
I show up for work and there's
garbage bags everywhere.

652
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,140
They knew I'd never say anything.

653
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,340
Where was this video
place you met these two?

654
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,820
It moves around a lot.

655
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,340
Might still be there. Who knows?

656
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,641
How do I get in?

657
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,126
It helps if they know you.

658
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,766
What if you come with me?

659
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,888
Can I feed my birds first?

660
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,121
Ray.

661
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,045
What was that?

662
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,380
That was his name.

663
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,160
Which one? The quiet one, or the...

664
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,126
Jesus.

665
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,900
I was off-duty one day in this
bar in Washington Heights

666
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,521
where cops didn't have
to pay for their drinks.

667
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,331
And a couple of guys came
in to rob the place.

668
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,091
I chased them into the street,
shot two dead,

669
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,208
got a third one in the leg.

670
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,484
He'll never walk right again.

671
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,801
Yeah. I quit drinking that day.

672
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,601
It just wasn't as much fun after that.

673
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,964
People are afraid of
all the wrong things.

674
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,606
I'll be right back.

675
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,200
I wonder if he'd pay
as much for the nurse?

676
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,048
We made a mistake. Come on, let's go.

677
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,521
Wait, wait.

678
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,940
They work for the fucking DEA?

679
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,140
Probably not for very long and
almost certainly not as agents.

680
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,180
Then what were they?

681
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,300
I don't know.

682
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,260
Maybe they were used as
confidential informants

683
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,860
or maybe they were office staff.

684
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,500
Whatever they were, they couldn't have

685
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,300
gone very far or lasted very long.

686
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,140
- Why not?
- Because they're insane.

687
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,140
They managed to get
their hands on some files.

688
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,780
One of which had my name on it.

689
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,980
And if my name's on a DEA file,
that means I'm being looked at, right?

690
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,850
Or you were at one time.

691
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,162
You know a lot of people,
do what you do?

692
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,780
It's not like we have a union or anything,
but I know a few. Why?

693
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,460
I want you to call them and tell
them what happened to Carrie.

694
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,370
- Tell them you've hired a...
- Are you fucking kidding me?

695
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,500
Word gets out about Carrie,
cops are gonna be...

696
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,620
They've done this before.
And they're gonna do it again.

697
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,490
This time I wanna hear about it.

698
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,326
What do I say?

699
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,725
You'll think of something.

700
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,481
I could have paid them.

701
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,051
I had the whole million.

702
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,140
It was our nest egg.

703
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,420
You know, the money I
was gonna use to get out.

704
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,420
And this guy I know, he was gonna
put me into some Internet startup,

705
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,220
sell shoes online or some bullshit.

706
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,580
It was our future and I didn't
want to give it to them.

707
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,644
Now how fucking stupid is that?

708
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,331
She was already dead.

709
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,011
If she wasn't, they would
have killed her anyway.

710
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,045
Call your friends.

711
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,247
Gotteskind?

712
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,163
I just knew her as Marie.

713
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,700
Jacinto. My man.

714
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,730
You know where it is.

715
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,771
She lived around here?

716
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,620
She worked around here.

717
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,820
Where?

718
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,360
On the corner.

719
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,806
No, no, your mama likes the
one percent, not the two.

720
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,660
She was a dealer?

721
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,460
She worked out of a crib
not too far from here,

722
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,091
if you know what I mean.

723
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,620
See that old building down the block

724
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,490
with the vacuum repair on the ground?

725
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,241
Hola.

726
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,611
All right, tell me, cocksucker,
what do you want with Marie G?

727
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,046
You on the job, fucker?

728
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,340
Retired.

729
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,324
Who you working for, the family?

730
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,540
Shit. When are you guys
gonna leave it alone, huh?

731
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,660
We didn't do it, okay?

732
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,740
Okay.

733
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,060
You think we'd just chop up a cop and
leave her on our own fucking doorstep?

734
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,739
My son's a fucking moron
but he's not an idiot.

735
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,851
Wait. Marie was a cop?

736
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,361
Who are you?

737
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,721
I'm not after you. Or your son.

738
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,326
I want...

739
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,140
I want the guys that killed Marie.

740
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,044
Not if I kill 'em first.

741
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,260
You dealing outta the store?

742
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,561
Not anymore.

743
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,364
But she was working you?

744
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,420
Working him?

745
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,165
Fucking moron wanted to marry her.

746
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,485
That's how good she was.

747
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,569
Hello, my name's Peter.

748
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,140
I'm an alcoholic and
still a drug addict,

749
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,860
and I got one day back.

750
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,180
Hi, Peter.

751
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,620
It's good to see all the
friendly faces again.

752
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,140
Still haven't managed to
turn your back on me.

753
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,700
So I slipped, you know?

754
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,980
It happens.

755
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,220
The funny thing is I didn't
start using until I was 28.

756
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,300
Yeah?

757
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,180
Up until then,
I never even smoked a joint.

758
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,740
Even when I was overseas, you know,

759
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,460
half my unit was on
one thing or another.

760
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,820
You were in the army?

761
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,122
Yeah, I was in Germany,
then Desert Storm.

762
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,660
I come home, go back to school,

763
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,246
and me and Kenny, we start dealing.

764
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,727
Just enough to get by.
It was more Kenny's thing.

765
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,140
He was dealing in college.

766
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,660
I do it to pay for art school.

767
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,340
Wind up getting hooked on the product.

768
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,620
Drop out.

769
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,420
Meanwhile, Kenny,
he stays in the business,

770
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,100
starts making some real money

771
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,420
while I'm eating garbage and
sleeping in abandoned buildings.

772
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,820
Till one night I nearly blew my fucking
heart out of my mouth up in Harlem.

773
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,281
What are you gonna do now?

774
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,140
I got this job as a breadmaker.

775
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,900
Figure stay busy at night,
sleep during the day.

776
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,440
Get in less trouble.

777
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,780
All right. See you around.

778
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,940
Take it easy.

779
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,289
The number you have reached is
not in service. Please check...

780
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,380
Directory assistance.

781
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,220
I'd like the number for the
East Village Plumbing, please.

782
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,260
What borough?

783
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,700
I assume it's the East Village.

784
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,081
One moment.

785
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,808
- No listing in Manhattan.
- Try Brooklyn.

786
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,620
Nothing in Brooklyn either.

787
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,081
Try all the boroughs.

788
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,700
I'm sorry, we have no listing.

789
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,206
Thanks.

790
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,940
What happened to you?

791
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,049
I bumped into something. You okay?

792
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,201
I'm fine.

793
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,900
- What you got there in your backpack?
- Nothing.

794
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,860
Just my notebook. Some Twizzlers.

795
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,605
Unless you're talking
about my pencil case.

796
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,740
No. I'm talking about the black
Beretta with the taped grip

797
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,580
you got tucked beside your water bottle.

798
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,881
Oh.

799
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,041
You mean this.

800
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,681
My new jammie.

801
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,500
It's a nice one.

802
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,260
What are you planning on doing with it?

803
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,860
I don't know, man.
Right now it's just for protection.

804
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,380
Figure, I'm gonna be a detective,
I need a piece.

805
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,380
Where'd you get it?

806
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,842
I was just taking a nap in some alley.

807
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,620
Heard some footsteps.
I seen some dude who works

808
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,220
as a lookout for some ballers.

809
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,091
He just threw the bag
in a dumpster and split.

810
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,650
You stole someone's stash?

811
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:41,610
I didn't steal it. I left the
money and the rock where it was.

812
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,020
They're going to come back
for the piece, you know that.

813
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,403
Naw. They're in the wind,
Matthew. Trust me.

814
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,844
Cops clipped their ass.

815
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,890
You know how to use that?

816
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,120
Shit.

817
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,528
Point it at me.
Like you're gonna shoot me.

818
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,161
Go ahead.

819
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,441
Come on.

820
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,366
That the way you hold a gun?

821
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,770
That's the way I hold it, yeah.

822
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,603
You know how to jack the clip?
Empty it? Clean it?

823
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,804
But the gun's still not empty.
You know that, right?

824
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,165
You know there's still a round
left in the chamber here?

825
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,840
Now. Put it back together.

826
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,860
Caress it.

827
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,003
Rub it, like it's part of you.

828
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,090
Feels good, doesn't it?

829
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,887
Word.

830
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,685
It's all oily and whatnot.

831
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,481
Turn off the safety.

832
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,161
Now cock it.

833
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,530
Now put it to your temple and
pull the fucking trigger.

834
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,291
- What?
- You heard me.

835
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,220
Shoot yourself in the head.

836
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,090
Might as well get it over with now.

837
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,660
Because you walk around with a gun,

838
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,340
sooner or later,
it's gonna happen anyway.

839
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,486
No rewind. No going out for popcorn
and coming back to the show.

840
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,700
It's just you with that gun in
your hand, stupid look on your face,

841
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,365
and your hash all over the wall.

842
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,531
Take it easy now, TJ.

843
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,881
Fuck!

844
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,620
Scudder, I'm assuming you're not

845
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,220
dumb enough to shoot a federal agent.

846
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,620
Show me your badge. Right now.

847
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,700
Okay.

848
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,445
I'm reaching for my folder.

849
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,407
Stover. Drug Enforcement.

850
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,081
Put it down.

851
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,500
Great. It's broken.

852
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,100
Next time identify yourself.

853
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,500
Hey, maybe we should pull over,

854
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,220
try again this time without the
sucker punch, see how well you do.

855
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,521
Why wait?

856
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,166
Hey, that's enough.

857
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,650
Who you working for? Kenny Kristo?

858
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,043
- I can't say.
- Cut it out, Scudder.

859
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,500
You're not licensed so
you don't have privilege.

860
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:02,321
And you're retired, so this gives you about
as much legal authority as a fucking mailman.

861
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,940
So the sooner you tell me what you're
doing hanging with known drug dealers,

862
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,686
the sooner you can get to an AA
meeting and not talk about it.

863
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,606
I'm trying to find Ray and
his buddy what's-his-name.

864
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,420
You know, the two guys that
killed Marie Gotteskind?

865
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,660
I don't know who you mean.

866
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,220
Really? They go around saying
they're on the DEA payroll.

867
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,220
Usually right before they chop
someone into little pieces.

868
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,180
Was Gotteskind looking at Kenny Kristo?

869
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,481
I can't answer that.

870
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,484
Maybe Mrs. Kristo can.

871
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,685
Although we haven't seen her
around for a while, have we, guys?

872
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,060
I know, maybe you should
talk to the brother, Peter.

873
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,761
Seeing as he used to spend
a lot of time over there.

874
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,921
Know what?

875
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,580
I was wrong.

876
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,326
This guy doesn't know a
fucking thing. Uncuff him.

877
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,564
We're done here.

878
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,608
In the program, they have this saying.

879
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,940
"Don't give up five minutes
before the miracle happens."

880
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,241
Scudder.

881
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,940
Of course the flip side of that one is,
if you do give up, you'll never know.

882
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,241
What are you doing here?

883
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,722
- I'm admiring your wallpaper.
- Oh.

884
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,940
Those are the studies I was
doing for the painting.

885
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,020
You do them all here?

886
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,420
Yeah. We had to.

887
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,300
Wanted it to be a surprise for Kenny.

888
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,841
Was he? Surprised?

889
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,367
What do you want, man?

890
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,161
You and Carrie put the DEA
onto your brother, didn't you?

891
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:58,740
Hey.

892
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,140
I wouldn't blame you for
hating the guy. I mean,

893
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,260
it's not just that he
has a beautiful wife,

894
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,340
it's not just that he's
got all that money,

895
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,980
while you work some
get-well job making donuts.

896
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,248
What would really get me

897
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,900
is how he can be around all that junk

898
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,446
and never use.

899
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,289
Carrie had nothing to do with it.

900
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,407
About nine months ago, they go
to Bermuda for their anniversary.

901
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,927
Carrie asked me to watch the house.

902
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,646
I'm there maybe a day.

903
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,580
Found some cash Kenny hadn't locked up.

904
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,220
I don't even think about it.

905
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,100
I go to Queens,
to this guy I know to score.

906
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,561
And you get busted?

907
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,924
Yeah. I get put in a room
with this woman DEA agent.

908
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,729
She's so nice to me, you know.

909
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,245
I give Kenny up like that.

910
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,927
Of course, it didn't help that
you were in love with his wife.

911
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,850
Sometimes I think Kenny left
that money out on purpose.

912
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,966
Yeah. I'm sure that's what he did.

913
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,260
I'm sure this is all exactly
what he wanted to happen.

914
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,700
What are you talking about?

915
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,480
That agent that busted you,
the nice one,

916
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,403
her name was Marie Gotteskind.

917
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,323
She was killed by the same
two men who got Carrie.

918
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,481
How did they know about that...
They stole her files.

919
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,121
And one of them, thanks to you,
had Kenny's name in it.

920
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,570
Tell your brother I'm done.

921
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,083
I'll return his money tomorrow.

922
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,364
Does Kenny know about me?

923
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,365
Not unless you tell him.

924
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,140
Yo.

925
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,851
There goes his bitch-ass right there.

926
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,580
Roll up next to him, man.

927
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,929
Yo, TJ! Feeling those new
Timbs you're rocking, man.

928
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,060
I know you hear me
talking to you, right?

929
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,885
Let's go fuck this boy up.

930
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,166
- Yo, slow your ass down!
- Whoa, whoa! What's up? What's up?

931
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,180
Yo, you got something
that belongs to me, man.

932
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,300
What you all talking about, man?

933
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,180
Where my Gat at, man?
That's my favorite piece!

934
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:15,500
Man, I threw it in the
fucking river, man. I...

935
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,580
What?

936
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,206
Serious, man? The fuck you
mean you threw it in the river?

937
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,420
Where you going?
We just want to talk to you.

938
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,500
Get back here, bitch.

939
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,404
- Yo, run his fucking bag.
- Give me that!

940
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,780
Yo, what's this cartoon shit?

941
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,180
No, no, no!

942
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,260
- No, man, that's my...
- Shut up!

943
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,460
Yo, where you get this money from?

944
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,980
- It's my allowance!
- You sell my Gat?

945
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,884
- No!
- Yo, take his fucking Timbs off, man.

946
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,641
No, man.

947
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,220
What the fuck? Yo, motherfucker!

948
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,443
- Fuck, I'm going to kill his bitch ass!
- Fucking A!

949
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,888
- What's wrong with you?
- You crazy? You outta your mind?

950
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,167
Any messages?

951
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,580
Yeah. JR called.

952
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,881
TJ?

953
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,780
Yeah, whatever.

954
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,161
Did he leave a message?

955
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,848
Let me think. No.

956
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,641
Well, yeah.

957
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,001
He's at Bellevue.

958
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,970
He got worked over pretty good.
But he was also out in the rain.

959
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,740
Either one could have
triggered the crisis.

960
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,561
- Crisis?
- He's a sickler.

961
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,924
He's got sickle cell anemia.

962
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,180
- You didn't know that?
- No.

963
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,660
Well, a sickler gets a cold or a chill.

964
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,660
Anything that makes a normal
person's blood cell count go up,

965
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,820
any time the body gets
ready to fight something,

966
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,940
the red blood cells panic,
and they take on a sickle shape.

967
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,980
Actually create a kind of a
traffic jam in the arteries.

968
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,580
The blood gets very thick.

969
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,300
Suddenly, you're not getting any oxygen.

970
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,726
What are you doing for him?

971
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,500
Well, we're hydrating him,
giving him Demerol for the pain.

972
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,466
But he knew the drill.
He got in here early enough,

973
01:09:39,567 --> 01:09:42,180
so I don't think it'll
go on for too long.

974
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,325
- I'll be right out there if you need me.
- Thanks, doctor.

975
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,770
Don't feel sorry for me.

976
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,121
I don't.

977
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,620
How long I gotta be here for, man?

978
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,604
Depends how well you behave.

979
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,420
You know, my mom told me
once that I got special blood.

980
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,245
That I can never catch malaria.

981
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,620
That's how sickle cell got started.

982
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,888
In Africa. As a defense against malaria.

983
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,805
Where is your mother, TJ?

984
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,220
Why aren't you a cop no more?

985
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,521
You first.

986
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,700
I had a crisis one time.
I was about 11.

987
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,020
My mom took me to the hospital,
but never came back to check me out.

988
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,700
I guess she thought that
if she left me there

989
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,540
they'd put me with a really nice family.

990
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,171
Little did she know.

991
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,847
I saw her in the street a few times
after that, but that was a while ago.

992
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,370
She had some issues then.

993
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,766
Your turn.

994
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,809
I was off duty one day.

995
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,740
I was in a bar in
Washington Heights where

996
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,500
cops didn't have to
pay for their drinks.

997
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,801
Wait a minute.

998
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,009
Three kids held up the place.

999
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,220
On their way out, they shot
the bartender in the heart.

1000
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,488
I chased them out into the street,

1001
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,540
and I shot two dead,
caught the other one in the thigh.

1002
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,300
- I heard this already.
- No.

1003
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,726
You didn't.

1004
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,481
You see,

1005
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,241
one shot...

1006
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,246
Well, the bullet took a bad hop.

1007
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:51,082
It hit a 7-year-old girl in the eye.

1008
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,605
Killed her instantly.

1009
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,408
An inch higher and it would
have grazed her head.

1010
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,048
Left a nasty scar. That's all.

1011
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,180
So wait, they quit your ass

1012
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,482
after you took on three
bangers by yourself?

1013
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,081
They gave me a commendation.
I quit my own ass.

1014
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,523
I never met anybody that tight before.

1015
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,900
Tight?

1016
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,201
Brave.

1017
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,281
I wasn't brave.

1018
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,965
I was just drunk.

1019
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,724
Don't feel sorry for me.

1020
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,206
I don't.

1021
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,450
Now, please.

1022
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,201
Watson?

1023
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,086
Watson?

1024
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,929
You don't know how lucky you are.

1025
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,761
Scudder.

1026
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,281
Hello?

1027
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,281
Kenny?

1028
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,286
Anybody home?

1029
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,326
And where've you been?

1030
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,729
- Been trying to call you.
- Where's Kenny?

1031
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,100
Whitestone.

1032
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,700
With a friend who says he's having

1033
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,820
the same kind of problem as Kenny had.

1034
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,121
The wife?

1035
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:19,801
Worse.

1036
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,420
I don't got that kind of money.

1037
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,820
You're the detective?

1038
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:36,167
Matt Scudder.

1039
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,780
Hello. Dani, why don't you go
outside and keep an eye out.

1040
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,286
That's a good boy.

1041
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,084
Now I post guards.

1042
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,565
The horse is stolen,
so I lock the barn. For what?

1043
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,700
What can they take from me now?
She's 14 years old.

1044
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,580
Fourteen.

1045
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,769
This is Anna, the nurse.

1046
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,082
They took her last night
and call us in the morning

1047
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:04,729
and tell us not to call the police.

1048
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,260
I remember Kenny calling the other day,
so I put two and two together.

1049
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,500
Mr. Landau, listen,
you have to know that...

1050
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,940
I'm sorry, what's your daughter's name?

1051
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:17,084
Ludmilla. But she calls herself Lucia.

1052
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,820
You have to know that
the men who took Lucia

1053
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,681
have already killed at least two
women, including Kenny's wife.

1054
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,420
As things stand, they haven't
got the slightest intention

1055
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,722
of releasing your daughter alive.

1056
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,940
In fact, there's a strong possibility
that she's already dead.

1057
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,940
- No...
- The police know about these two.

1058
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,580
They know who they are,
they know what they're doing.

1059
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,211
No, no, no police.

1060
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,644
You have to help me.
Kenny said you would. I'll pay.

1061
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,691
I'll do whatever you ask.

1062
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,881
Please.

1063
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,900
Hello?

1064
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,060
Okay, you know what happens next?

1065
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,860
Yes, I'm trying. I'm working on it.

1066
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,380
Well, work harder, Yuri.
We want our money.

1067
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,780
I just need some time, please.

1068
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,540
I'll give you whatever you want,
but please, the one thing I want

1069
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,100
- is to talk to my daughter. I just...
- She can't talk right now.

1070
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,970
You gotta let me talk to her.
Just let me...

1071
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,923
If she's dead, you get nothing.

1072
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,300
And who the fuck are you?

1073
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,604
I'm the best chance you've got
if you wanna get your money.

1074
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,860
But the girl's gotta be
alive and all in one piece

1075
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,140
for any kind of deal to happen.

1076
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,329
Are you listening, motherfucker?

1077
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,524
Fuck this shit.

1078
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,260
I can't believe you
talked to him like that.

1079
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,540
He knows what he's doing.

1080
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,820
The important thing right
now is to keep Lucia alive.

1081
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,700
That means these guys have to know
that they can't get a nickel out of you

1082
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,300
until we first know that she's okay.

1083
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,420
- But if you make them mad...
- They're already mad.

1084
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,260
But you'll give them
an excuse to kill her.

1085
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,660
They don't need an excuse.

1086
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,961
They're gonna kill her anyway.

1087
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,167
What they need is a
reason to keep her alive.

1088
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,860
How much cash have you got?

1089
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,446
I got damn little right now, but...

1090
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,140
Do these bastards want cocaine?

1091
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,329
Because I got 15 kilos
10 minutes from here.

1092
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,700
I don't know.

1093
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,540
Maybe I could get my hands on a
few hundred in counterfeit, but...

1094
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,540
I can't guarantee the quality,
and I'd have to return it.

1095
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,127
I got at least five hundred in cash.

1096
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,011
Time comes, I'll go get it.

1097
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,209
Is there another line I can use?

1098
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,122
There's a phone in my daughter's room.

1099
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,020
Culpepper Investigations.
Daunte speaking.

1100
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,321
Where the hell are you?

1101
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,140
I'm in my office, man. What's up?

1102
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,646
Why'd you leave the hospital?

1103
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,700
I didn't want some
Social Services person

1104
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,620
to come haul my ass
away to a foster home.

1105
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,700
I need you to do me a favor and get
me something out of my apartment.

1106
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,020
What's going on?

1107
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:43,660
There's a box up in my closet.
I want you to get it for me.

1108
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,962
The kid at the front
desk will let you up.

1109
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,721
Apartment 11G. Key's above the door.

1110
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,220
A guy named Peter will meet
you out front. Give it to him.

1111
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,409
And then go back to whatever
it is you're doing.

1112
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,500
Hello?

1113
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,740
I understand we have a
new player in the game.

1114
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,860
I don't believe we've been introduced.

1115
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,580
I'm a friend of Mr. Landau's.
My name is not important.

1116
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,900
I'm assuming that Mr. Landau's not
dumb enough to speak to the police.

1117
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,020
He hasn't.

1118
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,321
Then who are you?

1119
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,580
One likes to know who's
on the other side.

1120
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,380
We're on the same side.
We both want this to happen.

1121
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,780
Good. Then all you got to
do is follow instructions.

1122
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,525
No. It's not that simple.

1123
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,380
Of course it is. We tell you
what to do and you do it.

1124
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,100
If you ever want to see the girl again.

1125
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,460
You have to convince me
she's alive in the first place.

1126
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,820
You have my word on that.

1127
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,700
That's funny.

1128
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,900
What, it's not good enough?

1129
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,860
Let's just say you lost
a lot of credibility

1130
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,891
when you returned Mrs. Kristo
in poor condition.

1131
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,780
There were special circumstances
regarding Mrs. Kristo.

1132
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,260
Her husband tried to haggle.

1133
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:53,360
He sliced the price, and we in turn...

1134
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,082
Well, you can finish that thought
for yourself, can't you?

1135
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,209
We're not going to argue the price.

1136
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,646
You'll pay the million?

1137
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,360
For the girl alive and well.

1138
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,620
I assure you she's both.

1139
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,500
Your assurance means shit to me.

1140
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,660
Put her on the phone,
let her father talk to her.

1141
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,940
I'm afraid I won't be able to
put her on the phone right now.

1142
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,580
Please deposit 25 cents...

1143
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,740
Out of quarters? Give me
your number, I'll call you back.

1144
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,940
Yeah?

1145
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,244
I'm afraid the girl cannot come to
the phone. That's out of the question.

1146
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,460
How else can we reassure
you of her wellbeing?

1147
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:38,841
Wait.

1148
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,606
Tell me something your
daughter would know.

1149
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,801
The dog's name.

1150
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,408
They could know that.
They've been following her.

1151
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,286
They know your schedule.
They've probably seen her walking the dog.

1152
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,740
Heard her call him by name.
Think of something else.

1153
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:54,340
Yes. We had a dog before this one.

1154
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,007
A little black-and-white one.
He got hit by a car.

1155
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,843
The dog's name. And the name
of the dog before this one.

1156
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,620
Have her describe both of them.
Then call me back.

1157
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,047
The 16 years we were married,

1158
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:55,366
I don't remember her even having a cold.

1159
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,366
Then one day she wakes up and
says she can't smell anything.

1160
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,060
You were a policeman?

1161
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,089
Yeah, I was.

1162
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,608
You dealt with situations like this?

1163
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,740
No, not like this.

1164
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,780
Still, your gut must be
telling you something?

1165
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:18,651
What is it telling you now?
Is she alive?

1166
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,540
Yeah?

1167
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,366
I'd still like to know how
you figure in all this.

1168
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,371
Tell me the dog's name.

1169
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,410
Oh, well, let's see,

1170
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,289
what are the old standbys?

1171
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,048
Fido? Towser? King?

1172
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,169
Rover, that's always a popular choice.

1173
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:46,326
Hey, I know what it is. How about Bingo?

1174
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,281
What about Spot?

1175
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,883
"Run, Spot, run!" It's not a
bad name for a Rottweiler.

1176
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,340
The dog's name is Watson.

1177
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,846
Watson.

1178
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,540
And the other dog? The one before?

1179
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,420
She couldn't tell me what
breed the other dog was.

1180
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,609
She was young when it died.

1181
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,780
They had it put to sleep, she said.

1182
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,208
It's a silly term for it,
don't you think?

1183
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,100
I mean, you're gonna kill something

1184
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,721
you ought to have the courage
to say that's what you're doing.

1185
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,281
- You're not talking. You still there?
- I'm here.

1186
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,849
I gather it was a mongrel.
So many of us are.

1187
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:24,180
Now the name's a bit of a problem.
I may not have it right.

1188
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:27,290
It's a Russian word.
How's your Russian, my friend?

1189
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:28,761
Tell me.

1190
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,940
I may be saying this wrong. Balalaika.

1191
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:33,980
Balalaika.

1192
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,529
The name of a musical instrument,
or so she tells me.

1193
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,323
What do you say, pal?
Does it strike a chord?

1194
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:48,767
You got two hours to get
the money together.

1195
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,801
TJ?

1196
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,700
TJ? What are you doing here?

1197
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,331
Handing you this.

1198
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,485
I told you to give it to Peter.
Not to come down here.

1199
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,180
Matthew, that dude's all spun.

1200
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:56,084
There's no way I was
gonna give it to him.

1201
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,727
Later.

1202
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,260
How much have we got?

1203
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,460
Hang on a sec.

1204
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,921
Keep it separate.

1205
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,164
Holy fucking shit.

1206
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,206
This is TJ, my associate.

1207
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,811
Paper's good. Ink looks right.

1208
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,482
Nice used bills. This looks real enough.

1209
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,290
We'll repackage them slightly.

1210
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,340
We'll use the back wrappers,
but we'll take six bills out of each stack

1211
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,620
and replace them with real ones.

1212
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,402
Three on top, three on the bottom.
What's this make the count?

1213
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:34,220
I got at least 210 in fake stuff
and Kenny brought another six.

1214
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,885
Puts us right about eight.

1215
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:37,740
That's good enough.

1216
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,940
We have to meet face-to-face.

1217
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,242
You get an opportunity
to inspect the money,

1218
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,740
and we get to see that
the girl is all right.

1219
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,380
And then you people come down on us.

1220
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,170
You'll have the girl covered.

1221
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,500
A knife at her throat.

1222
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,580
If you want.

1223
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,060
The edge of the blade tucked
up under her windpipe.

1224
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,340
Whatever.

1225
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,740
Yeah, I don't like this
face-to-face business.

1226
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,530
We'll set up 50 yards apart.

1227
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,660
You'll be in place first.
You'll see us arrive.

1228
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,611
You show the girl, then I
come over with the money.

1229
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,900
- By yourself?
- Yes.

1230
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,980
Unarmed?

1231
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,300
I'll have a suitcase full
of money in each hand,

1232
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,523
a gun won't do me much good.

1233
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,451
Keep talking.

1234
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,820
You check the money.
When you're satisfied, you let the girl go.

1235
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,980
Your man takes off with the cash.

1236
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,328
You and I wait until you feel good.

1237
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,121
Then we go home.

1238
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,340
You could grab me.

1239
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:33,725
You'll have that knife you keep
talking about, a gun, too, if you want one.

1240
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,740
You'll see my face.

1241
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,380
Wear a mask.

1242
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,489
Cuts the visibility.

1243
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,891
I already know what you look like, Ray.

1244
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,527
What do you know?

1245
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,780
I know you're a genetic fuck-up,

1246
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,900
who, if I'd met on the
street 10 years ago,

1247
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,740
I'd have thrown you out
of a fucking window.

1248
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,180
Careful.

1249
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,380
It's been a busy year for
you and your boyfriend.

1250
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,180
You know, I could cut
the little cunt's throat

1251
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,580
and send her back to
Daddy a chunk at a time.

1252
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,848
- Then you're dead.
- Oh?

1253
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,780
Yeah, "oh."

1254
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,300
You want your money or you
wanna be looking behind you

1255
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,409
for the rest of your
worthless fucking life?

1256
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:14,524
Do this deal and I'll sit
on what I know about you.

1257
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,540
You can take your little
Bert and Ernie act

1258
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,100
to the other side of the country.

1259
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,209
There's plenty of dope dealers in LA.

1260
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,521
Where do you want to do it?

1261
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,940
How about Green-Wood Cemetery?

1262
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,580
Yeah, I think I know that place.

1263
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,929
You should. That's where
you dumped Leila Andresen.

1264
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,608
There are two entrances
on the Fifth Avenue side.

1265
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,220
Take the 35th Street entrance

1266
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,841
and head south about 20
yards inside the fence.

1267
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,164
We'll enter at 25th and
approach you from there.

1268
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,820
Say, 10:30.

1269
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,260
That gives you over an hour
to get there and set up.

1270
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,404
Leila. Was that her name?

1271
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,060
I would think you'd remember.

1272
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,840
No, once they're in the van,
they're just body parts.

1273
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:03,980
10:30.

1274
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,408
Oh, God, she was so scared...

1275
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,420
Have you got a rifle?

1276
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,620
Dani.

1277
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,921
Is he a good shot?

1278
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,060
During the day maybe.
Dani's a little nearsighted.

1279
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,930
Peter was in the army.

1280
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,683
Yeah, it was a while ago. Yeah.

1281
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:28,771
Give him the rifle. Keep Dani and
the other one here with your wife.

1282
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,084
I don't want to spook our friends.

1283
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,608
Who would like to read the 12 steps?

1284
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,940
Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm an alcoholic.

1285
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,605
Hi, Sarah.

1286
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,371
Step one.

1287
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,971
We admitted we were
powerless over alcohol.

1288
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,563
That our lives had become unmanageable.

1289
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,820
What's the drill?

1290
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,300
Stay in the car. Lock the doors.

1291
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,220
Call 911 if anything goes down.

1292
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,521
This is such bull...

1293
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,681
Step two.

1294
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,340
Came to believe that a power greater

1295
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,166
than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.

1296
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,580
That's far enough.

1297
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,220
Come out where I can see you.
Show the girl.

1298
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,409
I have a knife to her throat.

1299
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,220
If my hand slips...

1300
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,931
Let's hope it doesn't.

1301
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,920
Is that our money?

1302
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,091
Step three.

1303
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,700
Made a decision to turn
our will and our lives

1304
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,606
over to the care of God
as we understood him.

1305
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,420
Now, let her go.

1306
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,460
We ought to just shoot this cocksucker.

1307
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,250
Don't change the rules now, Ray.

1308
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,921
Let her go.

1309
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,851
Sweet Lucy.

1310
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,771
I hate to see you go.

1311
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,407
Lucia, walk toward me.
Your father's just over here, Lucia.

1312
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,961
Step four.

1313
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,940
What's the matter with her hand?

1314
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,660
Nothing. She's right as rain.

1315
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,282
Made a searching and fearless
moral inventory of ourselves.

1316
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,485
It was before you set the terms.

1317
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,860
Go to your dad.
Go to your dad, baby. Atta girl.

1318
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,484
Go on, get out of here.

1319
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,562
I liked her. She was nice.

1320
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,528
What the fuck is the
matter with you, man?

1321
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,490
Why aren't you afraid?

1322
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,321
I don't know.

1323
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:43,161
Maybe I don't care if
you shoot me or not.

1324
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,169
Or maybe there's a high-powered
rifle pointed at your head.

1325
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:56,100
I could still kill you.

1326
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,447
I'm right here.

1327
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,769
In some ways, you'll be
doing me a big favor.

1328
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,885
No. I think I'll just
fade into the shadows.

1329
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,740
They fucked us.

1330
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,041
Shoot him.

1331
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:11,820
Step five.

1332
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,521
Admitted to God, to ourselves,

1333
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:18,601
and to another human being
the exact nature of our wrongs.

1334
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,006
Step six.

1335
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,020
We are entirely ready to have God

1336
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,561
remove all these defects of character.

1337
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:40,881
Peter!

1338
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,925
Step seven.

1339
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,524
Humbly ask Him to remove
our shortcomings.

1340
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,420
Step eight.

1341
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,609
Made a list of all persons we had harmed

1342
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,611
and became willing to
make amends to them all.

1343
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,041
Don't move.

1344
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,084
Kenny, I got to tell you...

1345
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,620
It's okay.

1346
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,126
You gotta know.

1347
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:36,820
I loved...

1348
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,281
Step nine.

1349
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,642
Make direct amends to such people.

1350
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,801
I loved...

1351
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:46,451
I love you, too, man.

1352
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,088
...except when to do so
would injure them or others.

1353
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,321
Which way did they go?

1354
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,726
He shot me!

1355
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:15,540
TJ?

1356
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:16,841
Oh, Christ.

1357
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:19,484
He must have panicked when
he heard the shooting.

1358
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,766
He can't be out in this rain.
We have to find him.

1359
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,685
Well, he's got a phone, right?

1360
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,401
Help!

1361
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,201
Albert!

1362
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:13,561
Shit!

1363
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,041
Hello?

1364
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,561
Oh, fuck.

1365
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:22,900
TJ.

1366
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,100
Scudder. I got in the van.
They don't know I'm here.

1367
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,580
Listen to me. Get out of there. Now.

1368
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,260
It's cool. I'm in the garage
and they in the house.

1369
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,420
Which is where?

1370
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,926
Sit down.

1371
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,809
I've never been shot before.

1372
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:38,740
There's a first aid kit in the bathroom.

1373
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,820
Hey, I don't see any numbers.

1374
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,246
Try next door.

1375
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,260
697. Wait, no. 692.

1376
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,289
Okay, now walk away from the house.

1377
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,081
Go to the corner.

1378
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,843
- Is any of it real?
- Some.

1379
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,370
51 st Street and Church Avenue.

1380
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,100
Borough Park.

1381
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:46,640
That's not even a mile from here.

1382
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,005
Stay put. You hear me?

1383
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,321
Pigs.

1384
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,327
Hey, who's...

1385
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,564
Shit, shit, shit.

1386
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,820
You can have your money back.

1387
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,246
It's downstairs.

1388
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,765
Don't even think about it.

1389
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,807
You're the husband.

1390
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,601
So?

1391
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,660
I was just wondering.

1392
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,485
Were you just going to
leave Ray down there?

1393
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:26,801
No.

1394
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,860
I was going to get something to eat.

1395
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,020
I was going to clean up before I left.

1396
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,140
What were you going to do with him?

1397
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,601
Chop him up.

1398
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,980
Wrap him. There are plenty
of bags in the cupboard.

1399
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,860
And then what? Deliver him to
somebody in the trunk of a car?

1400
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:43,161
No.

1401
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,651
That was just for you.

1402
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,683
You have a choice to make, Kenny.

1403
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:52,980
There's a lot of hard evidence
against this asshole.

1404
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:55,487
He's got his dead buddy in the basement.

1405
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,740
Not to mention the van in the garage.

1406
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,726
It's gonna be full of fibers and blood
traces and God knows what else.

1407
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,002
He ought to be looking
at three life sentences,

1408
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:08,842
plus an extra 20 or 30 years
tacked on as a bonus.

1409
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,682
What about the other choice?

1410
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,241
You with me?

1411
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,201
No.

1412
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,540
I could turn him in and sleep just fine.

1413
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:23,380
I don't think I could.

1414
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:25,648
That's why it has to be your decision.

1415
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:30,203
Well, I guess I just made it.

1416
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,211
Take it easy, Matt.

1417
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,201
Come on.

1418
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,171
You know I could help
you with that hand.

1419
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:58,761
Could you?

1420
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:11,820
Shelter's gonna be closed.
Wait for me back at my place.

1421
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,100
Where are you going?

1422
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:14,481
Just do as I say.

1423
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:29,260
Step 10. Continue to
take personal inventory.

1424
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:32,325
And when we were wrong,
promptly admitted it.

1425
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,321
Step 11.

1426
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,002
Sought through prayer and meditation

1427
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:41,060
to improve our conscious contact
with God as we understand him.

1428
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,300
Praying only for the
knowledge of his will

1429
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:46,171
for us and the power to carry that out.

1430
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:52,721
Step 12. Having had a spiritual
awakening as the result of these steps,

1431
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:56,060
we try to carry this
message to alcoholics

1432
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,842
and to practice these
principles in all our affairs.

1433
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,366
Kenny?

1434
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,201
You know,

1435
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:46,666
I just wanted to...
