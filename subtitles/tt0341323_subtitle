00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:17.458
 Walk carefully. 
2
00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:21.500
 Just a minute, slowly. 
3
00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.916
 Madam, just a second. 
4
00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:34.000
Madam, there is a problem. - What happened? 

2
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,958
Justice Menon's grandchildren have still not arrived. 

3
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,458
 Why haven't they arrived? 

4
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,416
They very well know what time they had to arrive. 

5
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,375
Latest by 5 o'clock, still they haven't arrived by now. 

6
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,250
Are they different from all these people? 

7
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,166
I tried to contact them, but no one is picking up the phone. 

8
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,666
 He was such a well known judge.. 

9
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,541
..he knows the value of time why haven't they arrives till? 

10
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,791
Sir. - Please pack the food quickly, okay. 

11
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,041
 Okay sir. 

12
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,625
 Was I very late? 

13
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,750
 No problem! 

14
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,541
 You are very late. 

15
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,833
Let me get the food packet, then just watch how I drive. 

16
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:21,208
No grandpa, my father says you are trying to enjoy in your old age. 

17
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,916
 Forget your papa. 

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,375
I have been driving even before he was born. 

19
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,541
 Since childhood. 

20
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,333
 You are making fun of me. 

21
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,250
What is your programme after dropping us? 

22
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,791
Programme! After dropping you both I will enjoy alone. 

23
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,750
 Excuse me sir, your parcel. Thank you. 

24
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,250
Grandfather, why are you driving so slow? 

25
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,041
Drive faster, or else the teacher will be angry. 

26
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:47,666
Is that so, I will appease your teacher. 

27
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,458
 Don't worry about that. 

28
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,875
 Good morning. 

29
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,833
 Sorry, sorry for being late. 

30
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,125
 Our car broke down on the road. 

31
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,708
 It's alright sir, no problem. 

32
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,000
 I know you are very punctual. 

33
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,708
Okay sir, we should leave. - Okay. 

34
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,541
All the best. - Thank you. Good day sir. - Bye. Bye. 

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,875
And yes, stay away from mountains and waterfalls. 

36
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:32,166
 Okay. Fine. 

37
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,666
Take care of yourself, okay fine. Take this. 

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,541
Stop doing this grandpa. - What? 

39
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:44,000
You punish people that lie, and you are lying yourself. 

40
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,916
 That.. I am retired now. 

41
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,458
Come soon. - Okay, bye 

42
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,208
 I am leaving grandpa, take care. 

43
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,666
 Thank you dear. 

44
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,750
Bye. - See you. 

45
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,416
 Move from here! 

46
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,541
 Move everything from here! 

47
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:32,000
 Move back! Move back! 

48
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,708
 Move everything from here! 

49
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,750
 Come on, move! 

50
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,208
 Move back! Move back! 

51
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,375
Move it from here. Move it. quickly run the bull dozer. 

52
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,208
 Come here. Stop it! 

53
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,458
Whenever the police do their duty you arrive there with the camera. 

54
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,208
Get lost from here before I raise my hand! 

55
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,250
 Forget about raising your hand. 

56
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,791
You are doing your work and I am doing mine. 

57
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,916
And why are you worried if the public is watching your duty. 

58
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,041
Remember one thing, I am not one of those police officials.. 

59
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,416
 ..who are afraid of the camera. 

60
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,458
My name is John Wargis, I am not afraid. 

61
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:56,666
I know on whose orders are you uprooting.. 

62
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:02,458
..these people who earn their livelihood after a hard day's work. 

63
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,000
And that's what I want to tell the public. 

64
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,416
Fredrick. - Yes. - Come on! - Yes sir. 

65
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,125
 Welcome back to True Vision. 

66
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,333
 This one acre land of Marine Drive. 

67
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,041
Ex M.P Mr. I.K Thomas has taken on leas for 99 years.. 

68
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,833
..from the orders of the special department. 

69
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:25,958
Like always, this is his plan with is contractor friend Sachidanand. 

70
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,250
And breaking the rule of this complex.. 

71
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,000
..a multi-storey complex has to be constructed here. 

72
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,666
And the truck filled with the materials.. 

73
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,291
..to construct that building will go through here.. 

74
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,041
 ..destroying these poor people. 

75
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,958
Even after the police's interference and hooliganism.. 

76
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,583
..we are bringing to you this report. Bye. Cut it. 

77
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,333
 The story is not over. 

78
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,041
The end part of the story, on the screen.. 

79
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,541
..tonight 9 o'clock, on True Vision channel. 

80
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,541
 Wish you happy evening. 

81
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,125
 What did you say? What did you say? 

82
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,208
Tonight 9 o'clock, take the cassette out. 

83
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,541
We won't tolerate the police's hooliganism! 

84
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,291
We won't tolerate the police's hooliganism! 

85
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,875
 Take the cassette out. 

86
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,208
 Come on Fredrick. 

87
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,041
 Police, go back. 

88
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,333
 Hello Mr. Vijay. 

89
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,708
Bravo. - Thank you. 

90
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,958
You are much more than a TV news reader. 

91
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,916
 I am Menon, a great fan of yours. 

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,083
Retired judge.. - There is no need for your introduction. 

93
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,583
 I am a fan of yours too. 

94
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,583
 What are you saying, thanks! 

95
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,875
I have read your articles on human rights, with great detail. 

96
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,791
 And I have filed them too. 

97
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,458
One more thing, I am inviting you now.. 

98
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,500
..for True Vision's function which is next month. 

99
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,125
 My pleasure. 

100
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,458
What you said right now, is absolutely right. 

101
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,708
The BMC has still not given the permission for the building.. 

102
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,416
..and they are being moved before that. 

103
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,875
 That's absolutely wrong! 

104
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,583
This is not the way to remove them. - Sir, just a minute. 

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,333
 Frederick, get ready. 

106
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,208
Sir, will you repeat what you just said for our channel. 

107
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,958
 Now? 

108
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,125
 Sir, please. 

109
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,916
If I get your expert comments my story will become stronger. 

110
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:30,625
Okay. Thank you. Ready. - Yes. - Rolling. - Yes, sir. - Start. 

111
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,583
 Footpath.. - Sir, over here. 

112
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,208
It is the right of the law to stop business on footpath. 

113
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,458
 But the law makers change the law. 

114
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,291
 They compromise with the shopkeepers.. 

115
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:16,208
 Yes, so children. Wait. Wait. 

116
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,416
Look, I have brought something for all of you. 

117
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,125
Yes, take this. - Me, first. - Take. Take. 

118
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,708
Come and meet me if someone is left out. Okay? 

119
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,500
Hi. - Hi. 

120
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,125
 Hello. Hello. 

121
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,375
 Which floor? 

122
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,291
 5th floor. Who is there? 

123
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,750
 I have shifted here. 5B. 

124
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:24,458
5B? - Yes. - What a surprise. I am in 5A. 

125
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:29,208
So we are neighbours. I am Chandrasekhar Menon.

I am joining in Yusuf Multimedia from tomorrow. 

130
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:44,875
Fine. - Hello, sir. - Hello, where are you going? 

131
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,041
Her brother's daughter is getting married in Peddar road. 

132
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,791
Yes. - There are hosting a party. We are going there. 

133
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,166
You are alone. Shall I bring food for you? 

134
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,125
 No, I have already brought it. 

135
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,375
The joy of having food and drinks alone is great. 

136
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,500
Isn't it Jatin brother? - What can I say in front of my wife? 

137
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:06,208
That is okay. - Bye. - Bye. Okay bye. Sorry. - It's okay. 

138
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,666
You have come here today. You will have to work now. 

139
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,750
Yes. I have not even unpacked till now. 

140
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,541
 All right, your family? 

141
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:31,750
I have a family. They live in Mumbai. - I see. 

142
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,500
Come. My daughter and son-in-law are doctors. 

143
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,958
They have gone to Delhi for a conference. 

144
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,416
 They will return on Christmas. 

145
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,583
And my 2 grandchildren has gone to a school picnic. 

146
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,916
 They will come after 5 days. 

147
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,708
 Look I have bought cooking items. 

148
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:54,083
And what about you? What have you arranged for food? 

149
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,041
I have not thought about it till now? - Okay. 

150
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,791
There is no need to think about it now. 

151
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,541
 Jasmine you are my neighbour. 

152
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,125
We will eat together today. - No thank you. 

153
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,791
Why there is no need? Look, I am alone. 

154
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,125
 If you accompany me I will feel nice. 

155
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:15,666
First freshen up. My flat is there. I will wait for you. 

156
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,791
Okay? - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. - See you then. 

157
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,000
 Yes, listen. 

158
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,583
 You don't need to be afraid of me. 

159
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,625
 I am a harmless old man. 

160
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:32,750
Whatever it is hurry up. I have other important work. 

161
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,875
 Look. I told you from before. 

162
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,125
We will call up and go to Menon's house. 

163
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,750
 But you didn't listen and came up. 

164
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,375
I don't need to take an appointment with Mr. Menon. 

165
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,458
It's been 15 years since we had worked together. 

166
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,875
Do you still think that I have to approach you formally? 

167
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,291
 All right tell me.. 

168
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,000
 I have come to tell you that. 

169
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,375
We 2 are going for foreign tour in 2 days.. 

170
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,916
 ..with the industrial minister. 

171
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,666
I am ex-Member of Parliament from the opposing party. 

172
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,666
My and the minister's party are also different. 

173
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,583
But we think the same way. So I agreed. 

174
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,833
 Mr. Harsha. Can we talk of work now? 

175
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,875
Exactly. Nothing is hidden from Mr. Menon. 

176
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,666
 It is my friend's Sachitanand's work. 

177
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:53,000
The old business where I am financially interested. 

178
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:57,791
Fake wine and spirit goes abroad everyday from his distillery. 

179
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,708
When the union came to know of it there was a strike at the factory. 

180
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,708
The police investigated the matter. But it was of no use. 

181
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,875
 That was my bad time. 

182
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,000
The union leader was killed at that time. 

183
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:14,541
That was a family matter. - Yes, it was my family matter. 

184
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,250
 The police said that it was suicide. 

185
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,041
 But to calm the union the government.. 

186
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,250
..is setting another committee for enquiry. 

187
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:29,750
We have been informed that that case is in your hands. 

188
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:35,583
The commission work will start before we return from Europe. 

189
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,958
You will have to help us. I am sure you will help us out. 

190
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,291
 No, I can't help you in this matter. 

191
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,541
I think God has given us a good chance to meet again. 

192
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,875
Stop it I say. I can do nothing against my ideals. 

193
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,291
Look, sir. - Shut up, friend. 

194
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,500
We don't want to do anything by hurting sir. 

195
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,541
Let sir rest. He is the chairman of many charity trusts. 

196
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:10,125
And is justice Menon who walks the path of truth. 

197
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:15,208
But I was thinking how much time is required to defame a person. 

198
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,958
The way a high rise building falls down quickly. 

199
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,875
And the dream breaks as soon as you open your eyes. 

200
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,916
I am not going to be scared with your threatening. 

201
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,583
 The one who love life are scared. 

202
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,375
 Okay, we won't bother you. 

203
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,333
 Come. 

204
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:39,458
Come. - I am leaving, Menon sir, but we will meet again. 

205
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,041
Hello, you have come early. Much before time. 

206
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:03,791
 You said, sharp 8:30. Look, its 8:29. 

207
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,083
 So I will wait outside for a minute. 

208
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,916
 No, it is not like that. 

209
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,666
I was thinking what to prepare for you. 

210
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,208
 Means! 

211
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,375
But the aroma of food.. - Smell.. 

212
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,791
What have you prepared? - Yes. 

213
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,708
But it's a long time since I have eaten home cooked food. 

214
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:49,708
Now I know why your mood was spoiled. - How? 

215
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,500
 By seeing your kitchen condition. 

216
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:58,625
All right, I will leave. - No, sit. Sit down. 

217
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,875
I was about to cook, when they arrived. - Who? 

218
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:11,000
My friends. My mood was spoiled by them. Leave it. 

219
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,291
Now there is no use remembering old things. 

220
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,958
You are right. Even I don't think about olden days. 

221
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,833
 But I can't forget about dinner. 

222
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,708
Shall I stay or leave? - Of course not. 

223
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:28,625
How will leave like this? Let's do one thing. 

224
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,583
 We will cook and eat together. 

225
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,500
What is left in the formality of a guest and a host? 

226
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,833
 No. there is something. 

227
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,541
Now I am the hostess and you are the guest. 

228
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,458
 Only 40 minutes. My time starts now. 

229
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,416
 When are your parents coming? 

230
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,125
 And where do they stay in Mumbai? 

231
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,791
You said that we shouldn't remember olden times. 

232
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:10,708
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. - I am coming. I am coming. 

233
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,375
 My friends. They are very naughty. 

234
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,708
 Tell me what is the matter? 

235
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,916
 Uncle, we children have decided.. 

236
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,166
..that you will be the Santa Claus this year. 

237
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,666
Me? Oh no. - Uncle, your dress is ready. 

238
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,208
 Anyone can wear the dress. 

239
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:35,291
No, you will wear it. You will be the Santa Claus. 

240
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:41,791
Oh no, tell someone else. - Hello. Yes. One minute. 

241
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,416
 All right. I will wear it. 

242
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:50,208
But don't tell anyone that I am the Santa Claus. 

243
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,041
Everyone should know it later. Okay? - Even I know. 

244
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,958
What? - Santa Claus. Your call. - Yes. Hello. 

245
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,958
 Yes, one minute. Hello. 

246
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:10,958
I said she is not my daughter but she is like my daughter. 

247
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,875
 Swatch on the TV. 

248
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:19,166
Your interview with the incident in Marine Drive is on. 

249
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,875
Is it? It's going on. I will switch on the TV. 

250
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,125
Thanks for telling me. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. 

251
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:52,000
The buildings near the road are not legal. 

252
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,958
In fact all the buildings are unauthorised. 

253
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,958
And even the police are ignoring this matter. 

254
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:04,041
And all the people who are behind it have bought law. 

255
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,750
 There has to be a power failure now. 

256
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,125
 Come on. 

257
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,583
Sir, I felt strange when you invited me for dinner. 

258
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:21,666
But now I am feeling close. - You are right. 

259
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:27,000
Closeness increases when 2 strangers eat together. 

260
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:30,791
We will enjoy it. - It's strange theory. - Yes. 

261
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:36,208
Let's eat our dinner. And forget about your horoscope. 

262
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:42,166
Look, taste this. If it is spicy just breath in. 

263
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,791
 And burp when your stomach is full. 

264
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:50,000
And yes, if it is tasteless then spit it out. 

265
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,791
And yes if something gets stuck on your throat then.. 

266
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,333
 Thank you, thank you.. 

267
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,541
 My joke was played on me. 

268
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:11,125
I was busy when my daughter was a child. 

269
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,875
When I retired she became a doctor and become busy. 

270
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,416
 She got married and had children. 

271
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,666
To tell you the truth Jasmine, you won't believe. 

272
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:22,625
I and my daughter have never eaten together like this. 

273
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,750
 You are now in a good mood, sir. 

274
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:32,333
Correct. You are right. - Look, this is true. 

275
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:36,958
Good night. - Good night. 

276
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:43,041
I remembered my parents after eating with you. 

277
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:47,000
 I felt as if they are here. 

278
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,208
 Listen, Jasmine. 

279
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:58,708
Yes. Don't ever think that your parents are not near you, dear. 

280
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:02,791
Think that your parents are here with you. 

281
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:46,291
"The constellations have disappeared from the clouds." 

282
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:50,125
"And even the birds decreased from the clouds." 

283
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:57,875
"My sad heart is now seeking and amazed." 

284
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:02,416
 "I can't see, even I see nice dreams." 

285
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,250
 "All my dreams have died." 

286
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,250
"This heart which walks slowly is hurting me." 

287
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:13,083
"Even the breeze of the spring is lost." 

288
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:17,708
"The constellations have disappeared from the clouds." 

289
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:23,083
"And even the birds decreased from the clouds." 

290
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:42,500
"Papa says that this is the right thing to do." 

291
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:50,541
"The one who teases us will wear anklets." 

292
00:25:57,375 --> 00:26:01,375
 "In this calm silver like river." 

293
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:05,333
 "They sing something." 

294
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:09,125
"We will steal some sweet tune from flowers." 

295
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:13,166
"Come, let's find a lightning like pearl." 

296
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,166
"There was restlessness." "We started flying." 

297
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,875
"The bud of my heart started blooming." 

298
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:26,583
"When a magical bird gave me the message of love." 

299
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:31,000
 "I can't see, even I see nice dreams." 

300
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,875
 "All my dreams have died." 

301
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:38,875
"This heart which walks slowly is hurting me." 

302
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,666
"Even the breeze of the spring is lost." 

303
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:46,458
"The constellations have disappeared from the clouds." 

304
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:51,750
"And even the birds decreased from the clouds." 

305
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:20,250
"There will cool breeze with the sun rays." 

306
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,541
 "Come near me with such address." 

307
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:28,083
 "The way I sing the melodies." 

308
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:32,041
"The heart says something is going to happen." 

309
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:35,916
"This amalgamation of the heart strings." 

310
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,750
"The one which is made by the threads of the eyes." 

311
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:43,958
 "This colour is like the blue sky." 

312
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,625
"It has started spreading like desire." 

313
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:53,208
"Sometimes I fly in my own imagination. 

314
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:57,708
 "I can't see, even I see nice dreams." 

315
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:00,583
 "All my dreams have died." 

316
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:05,541
"This heart which walks slowly is hurting me." 

317
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,291
"Even the breeze of the spring is lost." 

318
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:13,041
"The constellations have disappeared from the clouds." 

319
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,958
"And even the birds decreased from the clouds." 

320
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:25,000
"My sad heart is now seeking and amazed." 

321
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:29,291
 "I can't see, even I see nice dreams." 

322
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,125
 "All my dreams have died." 

323
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:50,000
 You have come. 

324
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,416
Uncle, you are still not ready. - I am getting ready in 2 minutes. 

325
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,583
You are still not ready. - Only 2 minutes. 

326
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,541
Get ready quickly. - Get ready quickly. - I am getting ready. 

327
00:28:55,625 --> 00:29:01,375
Go now. Let me change. You go, I am coming. - Come. 

328
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:06,875
 Just 2 minutes. These children. 

329
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:11,208
 "Jingle bells. Jingle bells." 

330
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,750
 "Jingle bells.. 

331
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:44,291
 Uncle. Uncle. Who is it? 

332
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:49,625
 Who is it? Uncle. 

333
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,916
 Who is it? 

334
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:00,916
 Who is it? 

335
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:05,791
 Who is it? 

336
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,583
 Uncle. Uncle. 

337
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:15,791
 Uncle. 

338
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:30,458
 Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. 

339
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:37,583
 Move back. Move back. 

340
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,958
What happened? - I don't know. 

341
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,750
But only a girl is a witness. I think that girl is very smart. 

342
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:57,291
I suspect if she is saying the truth about Mr. Menon. 

343
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,541
 Why? 

344
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:02,916
The opinion regarding the relation of the girl.. 

345
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,500
..and Mr. Menon is not good. - What is the truth? - That.. 

346
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,791
 Mr. Jatin? Yes, sir. 

347
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:16,375
 What do you do? I work in R.D. office. 

348
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,833
How did you come to know of Mr. Menon's murder? 

349
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:22,833
I and my wife were leaving for the Christmas party. 

350
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,125
 Then we heard a scream from upstairs. 

351
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:26,375
 When we went upstairs.. 

352
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:28,708
 How did you know that he was dead? 

353
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,708
Dr. Toni from the flat upstairs told me. 

354
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,125
 Yes, sir, I am Toni. 

355
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,333
 Where were you at that time? 

356
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,000
 I was at my flat. When Pawan told me. 

357
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:41,625
I went and examined Menon. His pulses have stopped. 

358
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:47,125
Has anyone made an entry after 6:30 yesterday? 

359
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,708
It was the owners' children's Christmas party. 

360
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,708
There were many guests that's why there was no entry. 

361
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 So guests don't make an entry? 

362
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,291
 Keep care in the future. 

363
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,458
Mr. Jatin, what is the name of the girl who saw the killer? 

364
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:10,000
Jasmine. - Was the murder committed in front of her? 

365
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,416
 Sir, she had poor eye sight. 

366
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,291
 She had lost her contact lenses. 

367
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:17,916
 Because of which she was very worried. 

368
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,375
That's why she came outside to call Mr. Menon. 

369
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,000
 She saw it then. 

370
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:25,791
Do you know anything else about Jasmine? 

371
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:29,416
Nothing special. She has come recently to the city. 

372
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:32,083
 She is a compute engineer in a firm. 

373
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:36,291
I just know that she has domestic connection with Mr. Menon. 

374
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:38,791
Shivram - Sir. - Follow me. 

375
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:41,875
Come let's see that girl. - Sir, that girl is much tensed. 

376
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,250
 She has fainted many times. 

377
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:45,458
 The doctor has examined her too. 

378
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:49,500
Now go and collect the other proofs, I will go and meet the girl. 

379
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,250
 Sir. 

380
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:08,875
I will talk to her. Go. - But sir.. Sir. 

381
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:13,708
Sir the press people want to take photographs. 

382
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:17,041
Sir, they are not listening to me even after my refusal. 

383
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,333
 What do I do? 

384
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:28,291
 Who wants to do video shooting here? 

385
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,625
Sir, we are standing here since the last 12 hours. 

386
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:33,000
And we are not even allowed to take pictures. 

387
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:36,416
Is this justice? - Don't teach me law. 

388
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,000
 Sir, I am from True Vision channel. 

389
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:41,333
I want to have a live coverage of the murder spot. 

390
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,375
 You will shoot the dead body. 

391
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,375
You are always waiting for someone to die.. 

392
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,416
 ..so that you can have interview. 

393
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:52,875
Who murdered? And then how to catch the murderer? 

394
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:57,958
 Why are we wearing uniforms? Listen. 

395
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,708
Go from here. - Sir, please don't touch me. 

396
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:03,000
If I do? - I told you don't touch me. - Move from here. 

397
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:10,791
Strange. Move. - Excuse me. Vijay. Executive director. 

398
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:14,375
True Vision News services. Please let him go inside. 

399
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:19,208
I can't go against law. - I have just seen you and your law. 

400
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,208
 What do you know about law? 

401
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,708
 Please behave yourself. 

402
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:26,208
I have to meet the assistant commissioner of police inside. 

403
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,208
I will talk to him and not to you. - Where are you going? 

404
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,625
 Entry is prohibited. 

405
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,458
 What is happening here? 

406
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,916
Have you got the license to beat by having the camera? 

407
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,625
 First make him understand that. 

408
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:39,666
Has your department given him the license to be a rogue? 

409
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,166
Don't think that we have come to rule here. 

410
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,916
We have come here with the liberty provided.. 

411
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,083
 ..to us by the news service network. 

412
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:50,041
Stop it. Mr. Vijay. I don't have time to argue. 

413
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,833
 And don't prevent us in our work. 

414
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,708
 We don't want all proofs to be erased. 

415
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,541
 Mr. Anand. May I ask you something? 

416
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,916
 What are the proofs there which.. 

417
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,791
..will disappear as soon as we go inside? 

418
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:07,666
But if it hurts your pride then we will leave from here. 

419
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:11,000
But we will be forced to take the matter to the home minister. 

420
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,458
Let him go. I shouldn't face difficulties because of him. 

421
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,000
 Not only that. 

422
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,416
What are your comments regarding justice Menion's murder? 

423
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,250
 No comments. 

424
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:26,916
All right. You have to say the same in front of the camera. 

425
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,083
 No comments. 

426
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:31,333
 Sir. She is waiting for you. Jasmine. 

427
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:35,500
 Jasmine. 

428
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:43,708
Say yes or no. - Yes. 

429
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,625
 Then tell me, how did he look like? 

430
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,875
 He.. 

431
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,000
 Do you have a problem in speech? 

432
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,416
 I didn't see him. 

433
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,833
You just said that you saw him. Have you forgotten it? 

434
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:01,083
 What did you say? 

435
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:06,750
 I couldn't see him properly. 

436
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:10,750
I had not worn my contact lens then. I had lost them. 

437
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,125
 You have found a good excuse. 

438
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,375
 What do you mean? 

439
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:17,625
 I will tell you.. 

440
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:22,208
I don't believe in what you told the police and the people here 

441
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,083
Your explanation of the situation is least convincing. 

442
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:28,958
For instance, one thing that everyone knows. 

443
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,416
 A fact of common knowledge. 

444
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:37,375
Every person who uses such contact lenses has a pair of spectacles. 

445
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,250
 Do you have those spectacles? 

446
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,500
 If you have, are they in this flat? 

447
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:45,791
So when you lost your lenses why you went.. 

448
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,041
..to call Menon instead of wearing them. 

449
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,083
How could I wear them? My spectacles have broken. 

450
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,291
 Cut the bull shit. 

451
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,250
Just think with whom you are talking to. 

452
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,416
The spectacles breaking. The loss of contact lenses. 

453
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,125
And then seeing a killer whom no one saw and then turn back. 

454
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,041
 And don't think I am fool. 

455
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,208
 And tell me another thing. 

456
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:20,166
You were in Chennai before joining Multimedia. 

457
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,750
 But where you before that? Tell me. 

458
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:26,083
Come on tell me. Where do you belong to? 

459
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,416
 Where is your family? 

460
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:31,458
Family? I was in Mumbai before coming to Chennai. 

461
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,916
 Then why did you come to Kerala? 

462
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,416
 Tell me what your connection is. 

463
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:51,958
 You can leave. 

464
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,875
Listen to one thing. You will meet me again at my office. 

465
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,958
Answer my question after thinking then. Understand? 

466
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,041
 Please madam. 1 second. 

467
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:15,583
Can you tell me what happened in front of you? 

468
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:16,791
 Any comments. 

469
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,041
 Mira, leave her. 

470
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,666
 Leave her alone. 

471
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:26,333
Thanks. - It's okay. 

472
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:45,208
Good evening. - Come, good evening. 

473
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,833
 I knew you would come. 

474
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,000
 What was the need to act there? 

475
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:54,875
Listen, Vijay. Don't try to insult the police. Understand? 

476
00:39:55,041 --> 00:40:00,791
 Remember the time when you broke.. 

477
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:07,083
..a police jeep before joining the police force. 

478
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,541
You are talking f that time. My friends had teased me. 

479
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,125
 Okay. In front of me. 

480
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:19,291
 Greetings. Your interview was great. 

481
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:23,750
Do you have an opener? - I have one but it doesn't work. 

482
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:28,333
Okay. I thought I will meet Vijay before going home. 

483
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,958
 There is complaint against you. 

484
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,083
You create a lot of problems in the district commissioner's house. 

485
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,416
 That is the matter of my house. 

486
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,000
 The ACP shouldn't say anything. 

487
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:37,083
I can do anything in my house after drinking beer. 

488
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,500
You will say that you find it cheap comedy. 

489
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,000
Vijay. Vijay you tell me. Who am I to him? - Who are you? 

490
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:46,250
 I am his father's sister's son. 

491
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:49,000
Then I am his elder brother, right? - Right. - Isn't it? 

492
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:54,000
Yes. - When he insults me I feel like committing suicide. 

493
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,125
 That is okay. Listen. 

494
00:40:56,625 --> 00:41:00,333
According to protocol you are my sub-ordinate. Youngest. 

495
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,791
 Protocol. God is biggest of all. God. 

496
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,333
If he doesn't support you then.. - May I come in, sir? 

497
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:09,666
Yes. - Come. 

498
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,041
 One minute. 

499
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,458
This is news of 3 minutes. Give it to Nina. 

500
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:29,250
Okay sir. - Okay. What about your investigation? 

501
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,458
Got any clue? - Absolutely nothing. 

502
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:37,041
Who will get anything by killing a person like Mr. Menon? 

503
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:42,041
If not for property, then Menon's life must be hurting someone. 

504
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,000
 That's right. It may be right. 

505
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:47,791
Mr. Menon must have opened the door thinking that.. 

506
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,750
..the children have come to invite him for the program. 

507
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:53,791
With his clothes it is found that the shooter has shot Mr. Menon.. 

508
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:57,083
..as soon as he opened the door and has run away from there. 

509
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,875
The shooter who does that is hired. - You are right. 

510
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,625
Look Anand. What can is ay now? It's not a perfect killing. 

511
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,375
 Maybe he had some motive. 

512
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:12,500
 You know I met Mr. Menon 4 days ago. 

513
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:16,666
I was about to meet him today for our program. 

514
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,166
I didn't know that I had to take his dead body pictures today. 

515
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,958
Vijay, I think that girl Jasmine is linked to this case. 

516
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:32,416
Because they used to stay close. I will ask her tomorrow. 

517
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:39,000
Good morning, sir. I am advocate, Seema Lakshmi. 

518
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,000
All right, so you have come with legal protection. 

519
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:53,000
 Yes, why not? 

520
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:58,750
I have to come like this to talk with police officers like you. 

521
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:02,500
 Shut up. No, don't try to frighten me. 

522
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,916
Why am I not getting the right from the law extended to the masses? 

523
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:10,333
And if I don't have the right then refuse. 

524
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:15,833
And since you agree with her. What is this? 

525
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
This is certificate from the eye specialist from district hospital. 

526
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:24,000
Without spectacles or contact lenses Jasmine can't see anything. 

527
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,791
 He has written so in this certificate. 

528
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,833
 So how can she recognise the killer? 

529
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:33,000
What other proof want? Everything is here. 

530
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:38,625
The lens power and other details are in the doctor's certificate. 

531
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,083
 You can go through it. 

532
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:46,166
And yes you have asked that didn't you have spectacles? 

533
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:51,458
This is the photocopy of the customer receipt from Rose Opticals. 

534
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:57,958
I and late Mr. Menon have given them there for repair. 

535
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:02,791
Due to the power, they told me to collect them after 2 weeks. 

536
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:06,791
Now, you will have prove if I had broken my spectacles.. 

537
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:10,458
 ..or lost my lenses consciously. 

538
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:17,333
And your next question was my background. Identity. 

539
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:20,041
These are addresses of the apartments.. 

540
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,083
..where I used to stay in Chennai and Mumbai. 

541
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:26,166
 And the copies of the institutes.. 

542
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,958
..where I used to work and teach before. 

543
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,791
The one who has a criminal record doesn't have all these. 

544
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:39,791
And I don't want to say any more personal details than this. 

545
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:44,750
 Now I want to say you one last thing. 

546
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:49,208
Me not answering your questions yesterday.. 

547
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:52,083
..didn't mean that I was sacred by you policemen. 

548
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:57,458
In fact my not answering was my mental sadness. 

549
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:03,916
You know I am more restless to se the person.. 

550
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:08,958
 ..who killed Justice Menon than you. 

551
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:16,041
I am ready to bear witness at any court. Now good bye. 

552
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:25,416
Contact me at the office if you need me. - All right. 

553
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:31,458
Okay, I will leave. Hi. Vijay. - Hi. 

554
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:36,541
What are you doing here? - I came to meet the ACP. 

555
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:40,583
Jasmine, this is Vijay, head of True Vision News Service. 

556
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:44,208
And this is Jasmine. - I know. I have met her yesterday. 

557
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:46,083
 Maybe you remember. 

558
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:51,500
Only Mr. Vijay was lenient with me at that time. - Is it? 

559
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,583
And Mr. Vijay saved me from the media's attack. 

560
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:59,000
 Then you 2 talk. I am in a hurry. 

561
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,000
What happened after that? - Nothing till now. 

562
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:07,166
I have submitted documents to prove my innocence. 

563
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:10,250
 You must have read today's newspaper. 

564
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:14,625
Very pretty news has been published about Jasmine. 

565
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:19,500
But you know people from True Vision didn't write about me. 

566
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,291
And has been very kind to me. - We weren't kind. 

567
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:27,000
 Our channel has a strong policy. 

568
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,708
 That we only show standard news. 

569
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:33,666
And we don't show useless things. This is True Vision. 

570
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,333
I don't have that. True Vision. My short eye sight. 

571
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:40,000
 By the way, what is your problem? 

572
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,875
 A terrible short sight. 

573
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:45,916
My problem is that I can't see anything without lens. 

574
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:48,291
Oh I am sorry. - That's okay. 

575
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:52,500
Good morning sir. - Hi Vijay. - Hi. 

576
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:03,583
What are you doing here? - I have come to meet Anand. 

577
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,500
Retired DCP (District commissioner of Police), Mohan. 

578
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,916
I can't bear people seeing me like this. 

579
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:22,000
And Mr. Menon's daughter, son-in-law, children and other people. 

580
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:25,166
All of them consider me to be justice Menon's killer. 

581
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:29,000
I don't want to live suffocating like.. 

582
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,458
..this like a criminal though innocent. 

583
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,541
 I want to shift from there. 

584
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:42,708
If you don't mind, Mr. Vijay I need your help. 

585
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,375
 Yes, why not? Tell me. 

586
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:47,916
Find a new house for me, as soon as possible. 

587
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:50,125
 If possible today. 

588
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:55,166
I met Mr. Menon a week ago. He seemed to be very happy. 

589
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:58,500
 We talked a lot and played cards. 

590
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:01,375
Was Mr. Menon enemies with anyone, sir? 

591
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:03,458
 There cannot be anyone. 

592
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:07,541
But the protectors of law can have many enemies. 

593
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:12,000
Fine, sir. The last time you met did he mention anyone? 

594
00:48:12,083 --> 00:48:13,666
 Think and tell me. Nothing. 

595
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:20,000
I saw Menon was habituated to live along since the last few years. 

596
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,791
Maybe he has gone crazy because of old age. 

597
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:30,666
Anand, whoever has done this has done a bad thing. 

598
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:36,416
Use your entire force and find the killer. - I will do it, sir. 

599
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,541
Okay, see you, Anand. - Okay sir. 

600
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:44,333
Anand, is some girl involved in this case? 

601
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,708
 Has she seen everything? 

602
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:50,458
Yes, sir. But that girl has got problematic eyesight. 

603
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:52,708
That's why she couldn't see him properly. 

604
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:57,708
 I think she is very tricky. 

605
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:03,541
Sure. It's a lovely house. Thank you very much. 

606
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,625
How many times will you thank me today? 

607
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,083
How can I believe that you found a house for me in a day, Mr. Vijay? 

608
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:19,166
 Not Mr. Vijay only Vijay. 

609
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:28,125
Vijay I have told your friend the ACP my new home address. 

610
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:32,958
Otherwise tomorrow it will be published.. 

611
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:36,625
..that a girl trapped in rumours has fled. 

612
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,166
 Jasmine. 

613
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:48,875
Nothing. It is a nice name. It sounds like perfume. 

614
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,125
 You felt it. This is the problem. 

615
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:55,375
 Everything about me is like that. 

616
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:59,333
It seems something and is another thing. 

617
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:00,958
 What do you mean? 

618
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,791
I am the only eye witness of Menon uncle's murder. 

619
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,916
 An eye witness without eyesight. 

620
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:13,333
I saw but didn't see. I saw but didn't see. 

621
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:17,041
 But in reality I didn't see anything. 

622
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,125
Vijay I have never thought about my life till now, Vijay. 

623
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:25,916
 But I am very sad today. 

624
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:31,875
The one who gave me happiness, a father's love. 

625
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:37,416
A decent man whose murder ran away in front of me. 

626
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,708
 And I couldn't even recognise him. 

627
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:44,125
 Jasmine, leave it. Relax. 

628
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:51,125
Everyone is worried about my background. 

629
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,791
My village girl mother Saraswati had a love marriage.. 

630
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:02,583
..a Muslim businessman in Flora fountain called Salim Khan. 

631
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:05,541
 And I am their offspring. 

632
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,708
I don't know which religion to embrace. 

633
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:15,250
I learnt their language and their customs. 

634
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:23,541
And after they separated I was totally confused. Confused. 

635
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:32,416
I said everything but you didn't tell me anything Vijay. 

636
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:37,541
Even my life story has taken such turns. 

637
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:40,958
To tell the truth I have no relatives. I am alone. 

638
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:43,291
 So our story is the same. 

639
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:48,583
But I don't know why I told you all this. 

640
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,833
 Maybe you are friend in need. 

641
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,791
 What was that drama? 

642
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,708
 You are not scared of the police. 

643
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:52,375
 Where is your legal protection now? 

644
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,416
 What have you thought about me? 

645
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:02,791
Because I was lenient with a mad girl like you. 

646
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,375
 But the police are police. 

647
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:07,833
If the need arises not only you even your guardian angels.. 

648
00:55:08,666 --> 00:55:12,666
Leave it. Otherwise I will raise my hand uselessly. 

649
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:16,208
Tell me who is after you. - I am telling the truth. 

650
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:21,000
I don't know anything. I went there to do shopping. 

651
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:26,875
And suddenly that man fell on top of me. - Very good. 

652
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:31,375
You want to say that great man die at your feet, right? 

653
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:35,083
You are not a goddess. - It is not like that. 

654
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,750
 I don't know that man. 

655
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,041
I saw him for the first time outside your office. 

656
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:44,458
I don't know what is his name or profession. 

657
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:50,541
All right. Very good. So you have no connection with him. 

658
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:06,166
Anand about this.. - No. Shivram. - Sir. 

659
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:08,250
 Come with me. 

660
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:21,208
 Anand, why are you torturing Jasmine? 

661
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:25,541
Vijay you don't know. 2 murders in 3 days. 

662
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:29,416
That also of great men, in my area in front of this girl. 

663
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,791
So what? - This girl is connected to the murders. 

664
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,166
 Listen, Vijay. 

665
00:56:34,583 --> 00:56:37,958
Even Mr. Mohan came to me when this day this girl came to me. 

666
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:41,208
He said that don't spare Menon's killer on any condition. 

667
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:45,041
So what, Anand? This is not a connection. 

668
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,833
 What do you think of Mr. Mohan? 

669
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,666
Jasmine has murdered. - It is not like that. 

670
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:52,083
 Mr. Menon and Mr. Mohan's friendship. 

671
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:54,458
And Mr. Menon and Jasmine's friendship. 

672
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:56,875
It is strange that both of them were killed in front of her. 

673
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:59,666
I think it is too interesting to ignore. 

674
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,791
That's why Vijay I will interrogate her further. 

675
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:06,958
Don't be so stubborn, you do not know.. 

676
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,166
She is a decent girl, you are harassing her beyond necessity. 

677
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:12,458
 Vijay, why are you defending her? 

678
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,541
 I am feeling sorry for you. - Why? 

679
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,750
Because it's your mistake. Whatever reference she gave you about herself.. 

680
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,291
 ..you can confirm within 24 hours. 

681
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:25,000
 So why don't you do that? 

682
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:31,625
If you want more information about her than I am there. 

683
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:35,625
I will tell you everything. But one thing, if her innocence is proved.. 

684
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:41,000
..then you will have to let her go. Okay? Okay? 

685
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,750
You don't need to be too worried, Jasmine. 

686
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:54,000
I am not worried. I am feeling strange. 

687
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,791
 I don't understand anything. 

688
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:58,750
 Someone is playing a game with me. 

689
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:03,791
I don't understand why all this is happening to me. 

690
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:07,875
Don't think about all that. Leave all that to me. 

691
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:12,666
I will find the one who has done this. Trust me. 

692
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:23,083
 Will you always stay with me? 

693
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,166
 Will you? 

694
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:27,458
 Tell me. 

695
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:39,958
I will. I will always stay. It is true. - No! 

696
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:45,250
Don't demean our friendship by giving a name to this relation. 

697
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:50,708
 I have shared my problems with.. 

698
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:54,750
 ..a man for the first time. 

699
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,208
 Vijay, I have met many people. 

700
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:05,041
But I have got a good understanding friend. 

701
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:13,041
A protective partner and a friend who supports me all the way. 

702
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:19,708
Jasmine that.. - No. Don't say anything. 

703
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:24,000
Please I am in no condition to hear anything. 

704
00:59:32,875 --> 00:59:34,833
Yes. - Vijay this is me. 

705
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:36,833
 I want to tell you something. 

706
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,541
Jasmine is innocent. Don't tell her that. 

707
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:49,500
Friend Vijay I suspected her uselessly. She is innocent. 

708
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:54,041
Thank you. Thank you very much. - Hello. 

709
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:57,291
 Hello. 

710
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:24,541
Ready? Can you please explain me what is this? 

711
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,791
Hi, Anand. - Hi. What are you doing here? 

712
01:00:35,166 --> 01:00:37,875
 I have come to meet Jasmine. 

713
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:44,291
I know that you are very angry with me. 

714
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,875
I think I made a mistake. You are free. 

715
01:00:51,458 --> 01:00:54,208
At last I am free. Is this really true? 

716
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:58,333
Yes, it is true. - 1 minute, sir, check this. - Excuse me. 

717
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:00,875
 I have.. 

718
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:04,625
What? - I have bothered you a lot. I am really sorry. 

719
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:08,125
It's nothing like that. You did your job. That's it. 

720
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:09,583
Is that okay? - Okay, sir. 

721
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:15,125
This was a sensational case that's why I was excited. 

722
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:18,166
I said it's all right. - Check the disc too. 

723
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:20,875
Friend Vijay. Where are you going with camera and unit? 

724
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:26,166
Bhatnagar camp. Smile, friend. I am telling you. 

725
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:31,083
Excuse us. I am going to find Sachitanand. 

726
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:32,625
 Ex MP? 

727
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:37,583
Yes, he has a soft drink bottling factory around here. 

728
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:40,500
But he bottles wine instead of soft drink. 

729
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:44,416
If you want to know more about it then watch my TV program. 

730
01:01:45,083 --> 01:01:46,875
And if you want to know more about it then.. 

731
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:50,000
 Friend, how do you know all this? 

732
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:54,666
 Because I have a nose for news. 

733
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,541
 Wow! 

734
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:10,208
I have seen the hero's bravery for the first time. 

735
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:13,666
Wonderful! You are really brave. Great! 

736
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:47,583
"I will keep chanting your name like the holy Gayatri verse." 

737
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:55,583
"It gets mixed with the flora like the phoenix bird." 

738
01:05:56,958 --> 01:06:04,625
"You have started to spread in my heart." 

739
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:11,708
"You have become light in my dark night." 

740
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,458
"Give me your lovely eyes and your flowing arms." 

741
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:25,125
"I will keep chanting your name like the holy Gayatri verse." 

742
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,791
 "Darling, my darling." 

743
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
 "You mix melody with my breath." 

744
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:15,166
"This very talks of your wounds my heart." 

745
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:23,875
 "I am lost him in all the time." 

746
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:31,041
 "I am spread in the magic of love." 

747
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:34,666
 "Touch my heart." 

748
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:40,125
"Embrace me and let me touch your lips." 

749
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:47,875
"I will keep chanting your name like the holy Gayatri verse." 

750
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:00,958
 Coming, one minute. 

751
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:16,750
 No! 

752
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:36,291
 It's you. 

753
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:43,125
 Yes, yes, I know it's you. 

754
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:46,541
 No. 

755
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:48,750
 No. Wait. 

756
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:50,583
 Wait. 

757
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:52,958
 No. 

758
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:56,625
 No. No. No. 

759
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,625
 No. 

760
01:09:58,708 --> 01:09:59,875
 Stop it. 

761
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:07,375
 Yes, I am the one. It's me. 

762
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:09,000
 No. 

763
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:10,166
 Wait. 

764
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:11,750
 Wait. 

765
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:13,958
 No. 

766
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:17,791
 No. No. No. 

767
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,666
 No. 

768
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,916
 Stop it. 

769
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:24,583
 Yes. 

770
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:26,541
 I am the one. 

771
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:37,208
But why? Why did you do this? You are a killer. 

772
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:38,833
 You are a killer. 

773
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:44,875
 I won't spare you. I won't let you go. 

774
01:11:26,708 --> 01:11:31,416
 I said, please. No. 

775
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:35,875
I am killer, so take this filled pistol. 

776
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:38,333
 And shoot me. 

777
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:42,750
I killed justice Menon who loved like a father. 

778
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:44,333
 So shoot me. 

779
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:50,166
I killed DCP Mohan in front of you. So shoot me. 

780
01:11:55,375 --> 01:12:01,000
You can't kill me. No ordinary man can kill anyone. 

781
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:08,166
But I killed 2 men. I will kill 2 more men. 

782
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:12,916
 You should know why I will kill them. 

783
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:17,000
 And you know them. 

784
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,208
Thank you. Thank you for the compliments. 

785
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:24,125
But 1 thing we don't care about anyone.. 

786
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:28,708
..while handling such sensitive cases. It's okay. Bye. 

787
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:36,041
Yes, Vishnu. Not that. This. Not you. I was telling here. 

788
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:38,666
Make another copy from the master copy. - Yes. 

789
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:42,000
Yes, Vishnu tell me now. There are 4 big people. 

790
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:44,583
 All right, we will come. Okay. 

791
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,625
 Yes, now tell me what is the matter? 

792
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:51,166
I will tell you. First stop talking over the phone. 

793
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,083
Since the last 1 hour I can see that you have no respite. 

794
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,875
Look, if I miss even one call it means hot news has gone cold. 

795
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:02,291
 A sensational scoop. 

796
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:07,083
Even I have very hot news which will shake the public. 

797
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,250
 A policeman stays near my house. 

798
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,583
 Retired head constable Chandra Naik. 

799
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:16,250
 A few days ago he came to my house. 

800
01:13:16,583 --> 01:13:18,666
He wanted to tell some truth to everyone. 

801
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,875
When he was in service something happened.. 

802
01:13:23,083 --> 01:13:25,666
..which he wants to tell now. A major confession. 

803
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:28,041
He told me that some great people would have.. 

804
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:30,500
 ..been revealed by his talks. 

805
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,833
Which great men? - I don't know. 

806
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:38,000
I don't have the courage to publish what he told me. 

807
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:43,458
I am already in problems after publishing such sensational news. 

808
01:13:43,541 --> 01:13:46,875
He doesn't know that. That's why I have come to you. 

809
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:50,416
His confession should reach to people through.. 

810
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,291
..your channel without the editor's editing or the.. 

811
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:55,833
..management's censorship and interference. 

812
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:57,291
 Will you do it? 

813
01:13:58,208 --> 01:13:59,666
 What was his name? 

814
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:06,416
All right we will start. Throw away that cigarette. 

815
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,458
Tell everything with clearly. There is no need to fear. 

816
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:17,000
Fear and me. I am scared of my conscience. 

817
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:20,708
I couldn't sleep peacefully for years. 

818
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:27,458
I can't tolerate this anymore. Even God won't forgive me. 

819
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:32,416
 Mr. Madhavan was a God like person. 

820
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:38,458
We don't get current because of the Electricity board's carelessness. 

821
01:14:38,666 --> 01:14:45,333
That's why the public has to stay in darkness. 

822
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:48,875
Papa, current has gone. - Sridevi, light a lamp. 

823
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:50,833
The current went as soon as he started to read. 

824
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:52,250
 I think there is a power failure. 

825
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:57,333
 You should think before writing. 

826
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:59,125
 We have a power failure now. 

827
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:02,250
Only our house has a power failure? - Or what? 

828
01:15:07,375 --> 01:15:11,208
 Son, go inside and read. Carefully. 

829
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:16,375
 The poor boy has exams next week. 

830
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:22,500
Even I had studied M.A. in this light, Sridevi. - Leave it. 

831
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:25,958
Why do you repeat useless talks? He is a child. 

832
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,250
 He understands our problem. 

833
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:31,416
He is not stubborn like other children. 

834
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,458
 I regret thinking this. 

835
01:15:36,541 --> 01:15:39,208
 If I compromise a bit then I can.. 

836
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:43,125
..be the chief editor of a bug newspaper. 

837
01:15:43,833 --> 01:15:47,666
But I won't be able to do this ever. - Listen. 

838
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:54,291
Don't ever think or say like that. To tell the truth. 

839
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:55,875
 You are great. 

840
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,458
 Open the door. 

841
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,750
Who is it? - Is there anyone? Open the door. 

842
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:04,125
 Yes, I am coming. 

843
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:14,375
 Who are you? 

844
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:24,000
Save me. They will kill me. - Who? Hold the candle. 

845
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:27,500
I will see. - Don't worry. No one will come here. 

846
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,333
 Where do you stay? What is your name? 

847
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:34,041
Rosie. I have come from far away. They will kill me. 

848
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,291
 Son, go inside. 

849
01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:43,958
Dear tell me what is it? You don't need to be scared. 

850
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,833
I had come to work in Sachitanand's cold drink factory. 

851
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:51,000
My parents' relative John had given me this job. 

852
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:59,000
In the evening they locked me in the factory's hostel room. 

853
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:03,250
When I said I want to go home, they beat me a lot. 

854
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:05,250
 I have somehow escaped. 

855
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:10,625
They will kill me if they saw me again. - No. 

856
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:13,083
 No one will see. Don't be scared. 

857
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:17,333
Take her inside and feed her properly. Go. - Come. 

858
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:25,208
Sridevi. - Yes. - Give me a shirt and a torch. 

859
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,666
Video business is been done in a place. 

860
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:05,500
And the great people are responsible for it. 

861
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,750
Prostitution is being carried out in a 5 star hotel near town hall. 

862
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:11,541
 There a politician and a contractor.. 

863
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:14,125
 ..bring girls with promises of job. 

864
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:19,000
And the great men in the world are its regular visitors. 

865
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:22,791
And law protectors are standing as audience. 

866
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:25,625
They are ignoring this even after knowing everything. 

867
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:29,250
It is good. This is knows as clean news. 

868
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:32,583
The writer has written for the one who should understand. 

869
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,000
 Precise and sharp. 

870
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:39,333
The writer has shot the arrow sharply. Isn't it? 

871
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:45,625
 Where is that girl? 

872
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:49,833
I will kill you if you came to me without that girl. 

873
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:51,625
 There is no use by bringing that girl. 

874
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:54,625
 Madhavan is our main enemy. 

875
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,041
 The matter has not ended here. 

876
01:18:56,333 --> 01:19:01,416
All the great men involved in prostitution will be published now. 

877
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:06,541
Leave that to me. I will kill that dog and his newspaper. 

878
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:12,208
You will smell of alcohol no matter how much you wear perfume. 

879
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:16,041
You have lost your intelligence dealing in alcohol. 

880
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:19,291
 Pen is mightier than the sword. 

881
01:19:19,916 --> 01:19:22,041
You know that all this illegal business.. 

882
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:24,916
..is there because of my political power. 

883
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:30,000
And that ordinary journalist wants to defame us by writing this. 

884
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,041
 No, I won't let that happen. 

885
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:34,375
 You think what we should do now? 

886
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:37,833
Have we made all this just like this by taking so much risk? 

887
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,291
I know how to work when the need arises. 

888
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:52,916
Hello. Yes. I.K. - Have you read today's newspaper? 

889
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:58,416
Yes. What can I do after it is being published? 

890
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,625
 I will tell you what you should do? 

891
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:09,208
All right. I will do everything in the police way. 

892
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,875
 But if this matter goes to court? 

893
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:14,208
Don't worry about the court. I will see. 

894
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:22,000
 Hello. 

895
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:24,333
Hello, I am S.P. (Superintendent of police) R.V. Mohan. 

896
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:25,791
 Madhavan is not at home. 

897
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:28,375
 He isn't. I had to tell him one thing. 

898
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:32,500
We investigated after the news was published. 

899
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:36,666
 What is the girl's name? Rosie. 

900
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,583
We have arrested Johnny who had trapped her. 

901
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,625
 I have sent a constable there. 

902
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:46,041
What happened if Madhavan is not at home? 

903
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,916
You come to the police station with Rosie. 

904
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,041
So that Rosie can recognise Johnny her in the police station. 

905
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,291
 But he is not at home. 

906
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:01,291
So what madam. It is a matter of 10 minutes. 

907
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:05,541
But it is difficult to bring that girl at once. 

908
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:08,708
Now it is not right if people like you do this, madam. 

909
01:21:09,083 --> 01:21:13,333
Only people like you can write that the police don't work properly. 

910
01:21:13,416 --> 01:21:17,000
 But no one comes to help the police. 

911
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:20,000
There is no one to write about the police's problems. 

912
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:25,125
Madam only you can tell me about that girl. 

913
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:26,625
 You will have to come here. 

914
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:31,125
Otherwise Johnny's man will force fully take her from there. 

915
01:21:31,416 --> 01:21:33,250
And we won't be able to know the truth. 

916
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:36,791
It is the matter of that innocent girl's honour. 

917
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:40,583
 All right, sir. We are coming. 

918
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:54,875
Hello. Is this Amar press? Is Madhavan sir there? 

919
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:11,708
The S.P. sir has called you to the police station. 

920
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:31,125
 Where have you brought us? 

921
01:22:31,458 --> 01:22:33,041
 We have to take the girl's statement? 

922
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,000
 Do you recognise the criminal? 

923
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:36,833
 Yes. 

924
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:50,958
 Have you read today's newspaper? 

925
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:54,458
Yes, I have. Madhavan's headline was great. 

926
01:22:57,333 --> 01:22:59,666
You will live for a hundred years. Where were you? 

927
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:03,000
I had to go out for some important work. 

928
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:06,791
Madhavan, where do you get all this news? 

929
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:09,375
Your newspaper is being talked about everywhere today. 

930
01:23:09,458 --> 01:23:12,916
I have got a good response. - Hello. Yes, I will. 

931
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:17,541
Madhavan, your call. - Yes. Hello. 

932
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:20,500
 Good morning. I am S.P. R.V. Mohan. 

933
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:23,500
Good morning sir. - I had called to prise your work. 

934
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,541
And yes you are worthy of congratulations. 

935
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:30,166
How? - Your story today was shocking and revealing. 

936
01:23:31,041 --> 01:23:34,625
I didn't know even after I was here in the police department. 

937
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:36,666
 I am ashamed to admit that. 

938
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,291
 What is the use even if you knew. 

939
01:23:39,375 --> 01:23:42,666
 Raid is going on there. 

940
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:46,166
 We didn't allow anyone to escape. 

941
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:47,625
 We have caught everyone. 

942
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:54,875
I am giving this report first for your newspaper. Come here. 

943
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:58,041
You will have a new story for tomorrow. Okay? 

944
01:23:58,708 --> 01:24:01,500
 Where are you 2 going? Go inside. 

945
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:02,958
 Why are you misbehaving? 

946
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,166
I have brought them to bear witness. - Talk to sir. 

947
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:06,541
Sir? - Yes. 

948
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,833
 I have brought them as you said sir. 

949
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:22,416
Go ahead. - Do I have to tell you separately? Go ahead. 

950
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:28,208
Papa. - Yes. 

951
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:32,166
Papa, where are you going? - I am going to take some important photos. 

952
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,666
Shall I come too? - No, son. Go home. 

953
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:37,000
No, I will come with you. - All right, come. 

954
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:42,125
Have you sat properly? - We will meet tomorrow. Bye. 

955
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:02,333
 Papa, look mummy is there. 

956
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,708
 Sridevi. 

957
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:09,625
Madhavan. - Where are you going? 

958
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:10,875
 Mummy. 

959
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:14,458
Sridevi. - Come. - My son. - What is happening here? 

960
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:16,708
Sir. - Yes. Hello Mr. Madhavan. 

961
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:18,750
I have given you the headline for tomorrow. - Sir. 

962
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:20,291
You have taken the photographs. You can publish it. 

963
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:21,708
 But she is my wife. 

964
01:25:22,708 --> 01:25:25,208
 Really? Very bad. 

965
01:25:25,291 --> 01:25:27,625
 What are you saying? My wife is here. 

966
01:25:27,708 --> 01:25:29,541
 This is surely someone's ploy. 

967
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:31,541
 Ploy? What ploy? 

968
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,125
 Before writing in the newspaper.. 

969
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:35,333
..you should have thought that your wife is a prostitute. 

970
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:39,541
I will take your life. I won't spare you. 

971
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:44,250
 No. no. Let papa go. 

972
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:47,958
Don't beat my papa. Don't beat my papa. 

973
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,375
Papa. - My son. 

974
01:25:49,541 --> 01:25:50,708
 My son. 

975
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:05,625
After going through the witnesses and proofs.. 

976
01:26:05,875 --> 01:26:11,916
..the police has produced regarding this case these.. 

977
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:19,333
..prostitute women are termed guilty and kept in judicial custody. 

978
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:20,708
 This is the court's decision. 

979
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:36,625
 Sridevi. 

980
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:40,625
 My child. 

981
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:44,208
Come. - Mummy. 

982
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:48,333
 Mummy. 

983
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:56,541
My child. - Come. Go inside. - Mummy. - My son. 

984
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:57,750
 Come. 

985
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:18,291
To tell the truth only one person is wise. 

986
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:26,833
What would have happened to us if he had thought such an idea? 

987
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:32,916
 Have you drunk too much? 

988
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:37,000
 You shouldn't say this at all. 

989
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:41,666
 Now I will relax and drink. 

990
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:53,000
 What is the matter Mr. Menon? 

991
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:54,291
 What are you thinking? 

992
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Look, I am trying to convince my friend Menon since long. 

993
01:28:03,083 --> 01:28:06,625
But he is not strong like us. Not at all. 

994
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:12,791
His heart is like wax. - Sir I know I have hurt your heart. 

995
01:28:12,875 --> 01:28:17,083
I am sorry for that. But I had no other way out. 

996
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:20,041
 Now have a drink. Please. 

997
01:28:20,458 --> 01:28:25,250
 We had been too unjust in this case. 

998
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:30,875
By the way I listened to you because I am also sinful. 

999
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:33,500
 But this is too much. Just too much. 

1000
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:40,541
Mr. Menon. Don't get worked up. Take it easy. I.K. - Yes. 

1001
01:28:40,625 --> 01:28:41,750
 1 minute. 

1002
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:48,875
Leave him. My subordinate is more tensed. 

1003
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:54,541
Head constable Chandra Naik. I don't trust him. 

1004
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:59,041
And I am scared too. - All right, call him. 

1005
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:01,083
 Listen Chandra. 

1006
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:06,583
 You? What is the matter? 

1007
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:10,750
He used to come thrice a day to get his daughter admitted in college. 

1008
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:17,958
And now no greetings at all. Good. Take, have a drink. 

1009
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:20,708
No, sir. - Drink. - No. - 

1010
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,333
You don't want to drink in front of your sir. 

1011
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:25,958
There is nothing like that. This is strictly unofficial. 

1012
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:29,291
No, sir. - What happened? Are you okay? 

1013
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:31,875
 Or are you in confusion? 

1014
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:36,125
Still whatever happened to Madhavan was not right. 

1015
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:40,750
Even I am a part of this crime sir.. - Stop your nonsense. 

1016
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:45,375
Listen friend. He is absolutely right. We were not good. 

1017
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:48,916
By the way this is war tactics. To kill the enemy. Leave it. 

1018
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:51,708
 You neither saw nor heard anything. 

1019
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:56,125
Your daughter will need a god job after her education. 

1020
01:29:56,708 --> 01:29:58,000
 After that you have to marry her too. 

1021
01:29:58,458 --> 01:30:00,916
To tell the truth you are alive for them. 

1022
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,458
You are doing everything for your children. 

1023
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:04,541
 If something happened to them. 

1024
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:08,541
What sir? - No, nothing of that sort will happen. 

1025
01:30:08,791 --> 01:30:10,166
 And it shouldn't happen either. 

1026
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
 Madhavan? Come in. 

1027
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,708
 There is a court held here too. 

1028
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:38,000
 We were talking about the police raid. 

1029
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,208
 Madhavan, we salute you. 

1030
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:43,750
We came to know of it after reading your newspaper. 

1031
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:45,958
Isn't it, Mohan? - Yes. - Isn't it, Sachi? - Yes. 

1032
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:49,125
Didn't you know this used to happen in your factory? 

1033
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:50,833
 No, I didn't know. 

1034
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:52,750
 You don't know anything. Right? 

1035
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:55,000
 I will tell you one more thing. 

1036
01:30:55,791 --> 01:30:59,041
 My wife Sridevi has committed suicide. 

1037
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:03,750
I have come here after seeing her hanging corpse. 

1038
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:07,708
 This matter won't end here. 

1039
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:12,333
 I won't spare you 4 devils. I will.. 

1040
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:15,875
I will kill everyone. I will kill everyone. 

1041
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:22,750
Traitor, I won't spare you. I will never spare you. 

1042
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:40,833
You are right, Madhavan. The story has not ended here. 

1043
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:44,458
Your wife has committed suicide in sorrow. 

1044
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:48,000
And fearing defamation you committed suicide under a train. 

1045
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:49,958
 Sorry, friend. 

1046
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:51,791
 No. 

1047
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:56,500
All right. I won't take law in my hands. 

1048
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:59,791
Then I will make the law protector do this. Isn't it? 

1049
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:07,375
Chandra Naik, come here. Take this revolver. Take. 

1050
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,416
 Mohan tell him. 

1051
01:32:10,541 --> 01:32:12,125
 Take the gun I say. 

1052
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:22,791
 Shoot him. 

1053
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,166
 Shoot him. 

1054
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:32,166
 Shoot him. 

1055
01:32:32,708 --> 01:32:33,916
 Shoot him. 

1056
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:37,958
 Shoot him. 

1057
01:32:39,458 --> 01:32:43,125
 Madhavan was killed with these hands. 

1058
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:48,083
But I feel light after telling you the truth. 

1059
01:32:49,208 --> 01:32:56,541
 Today I can sleep peacefully. I can. 

1060
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,916
The scoundrel will sleep peacefully after telling a story. 

1061
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:03,125
 Now listen to me. 

1062
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:07,166
A son is living like mad since 20 years hearing.. 

1063
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:10,000
 ..that his mother is a prostitute. 

1064
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:13,625
His father was not a coward to commit suicide after hearing this. 

1065
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:16,250
The son shed tears of blood at his father's death. 

1066
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:20,708
And do you know who the son of that goddess like mother is? 

1067
01:33:20,916 --> 01:33:25,208
That is me. And there is no forgiveness in my court. 

1068
01:33:25,958 --> 01:33:28,833
 Let him go. Let him go. Please. 

1069
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:36,375
No, I won't kill you. I will keep you alive. 

1070
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:42,875
You will prove my mother innocent in front of the entire world. 

1071
01:33:43,833 --> 01:33:48,708
I knew that my father was not a coward to commit suicide. 

1072
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:50,333
 You will prove him innocent. 

1073
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:54,000
 I am ready to say this in any court. 

1074
01:33:54,833 --> 01:33:56,000
 You will say on court. 

1075
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:13,250
 Now I will decide about these 4. 

1076
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:21,583
I feel light after telling you the truth. 

1077
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:29,125
 Today I can sleep peacefully. I can. 

1078
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:34,625
 Vijay. 

1079
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,500
 I didn't know anything about it. 

1080
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:51,000
Without any reason, Vijay I.. Pardon me. 

1081
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:57,416
I really don't know if what you have done is right or wrong. 

1082
01:34:59,375 --> 01:35:05,750
 Don't do this in future. Nothing. 

1083
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:10,000
 Let me decide what is right and wrong. 

1084
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:16,083
But this fire will never get extinguished. Pardon me. 

1085
01:35:18,083 --> 01:35:19,250
 And forget me. 

1086
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:36,333
Chandra Naik. - Yes, sir. 

1087
01:35:36,583 --> 01:35:39,541
He has retired from Matunga police station in 1980. 

1088
01:35:39,625 --> 01:35:44,000
Since when he is missing? - From 28th. 

1089
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:47,916
And he used to live alone after his daughter's marriage. 

1090
01:35:48,208 --> 01:35:50,666
 And the daughter lodged a complaint. 

1091
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:53,833
But we have not found him till now, sir. 

1092
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:55,458
 We have to find him out, sir. 

1093
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:33,291
Chandra was D.I.G's (District Inspector General) special man. 

1094
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:34,916
 His close friend. 

1095
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:39,541
He is missing since 20 days before the DIG's murder. 

1096
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:43,708
Sir I think something is wrong, sir. - What is wrong? 

1097
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:48,958
No, he is right. We have to find Chandra Naik soon. 

1098
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,333
 Yes, you are right sir. 

1099
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:58,541
What is this? Why are you pointing the light on my eyes? 

1100
01:36:58,625 --> 01:36:59,750
 Stop it. 

1101
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:13,250
If you have problems with light then come to darkness. 

1102
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:16,250
 It will be easier to talk. Come. 

1103
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:26,458
I couldn't sleep peacefully for years. 

1104
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:33,041
I only fear one man.. - Vijay. 

1105
01:37:33,125 --> 01:37:36,000
Yes, Vijay listen. This is Latif. Have you met Chandra Naik? 

1106
01:37:36,166 --> 01:37:37,291
 Did he tell you anything? 

1107
01:37:38,916 --> 01:37:40,000
 What is the matter? 

1108
01:37:40,083 --> 01:37:45,541
He is missing. ACP Anand took and interrogated me. 

1109
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:48,708
Then I told him that I introduced Chandra Naik to Vijay. 

1110
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,208
 What's happening, friend? 

1111
01:38:23,125 --> 01:38:24,250
 Come. 

1112
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:31,583
I am bothering you but I still need your help. 

1113
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:33,541
 Tell me, what can I do? 

1114
01:38:35,666 --> 01:38:36,791
 Come. 

1115
01:38:43,208 --> 01:38:45,833
 I can't keep him with me now. 

1116
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:49,708
 If I do I may face problems. 

1117
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:55,333
Your house is the best for him to hide. Only for 2 days. 

1118
01:38:55,416 --> 01:38:56,541
 Please. 

1119
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:01,125
 After that I will take him elsewhere. 

1120
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:06,791
Go to that room. - Go. 

1121
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:15,166
 Sorry. 

1122
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,625
 And thanks. 

1123
01:39:21,666 --> 01:39:24,166
Okay, you have come with official work. 

1124
01:39:24,416 --> 01:39:27,000
 I thought you have come to meet me. 

1125
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:31,875
I try to but I don't get time from work. - That's okay. 

1126
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:34,041
 Tell me, what can I do for you? 

1127
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:37,375
 I need to know about a man. 

1128
01:39:37,625 --> 01:39:40,708
These are his S.S.E. (School leaving exam) certificates. 

1129
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:44,458
I think he has studied from this school. - Yes. 

1130
01:39:44,708 --> 01:39:46,000
 All the details are here. 

1131
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,000
Even you used study here then. - Yes, sir. 

1132
01:39:50,625 --> 01:39:53,791
 I can be helped with your old records. 

1133
01:39:53,875 --> 01:39:57,125
Okay, let's try. - Thank you, sir. 

1134
01:39:59,375 --> 01:40:02,000
This is our Vijay. I can't believe it, sir. 

1135
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,250
Latif told me that Vijay went to meet Chandra Naik. 

1136
01:40:08,291 --> 01:40:10,375
After that Latif doesn't know anything. 

1137
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:13,833
From old records I found out that Sridevi.. 

1138
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,500
 ..and Madhavan had a son too. 

1139
01:40:16,041 --> 01:40:18,125
 The school principal told me that. 

1140
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:22,000
If the one I am searching for is Vijay.. 

1141
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:25,208
 ..then I will find the killer soon. 

1142
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:28,458
We don't know anything about Vijay's past life, sir. 

1143
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:30,291
 It is not like that, Shivram. 

1144
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:33,416
We have to meet Chandra Naik for further investigation. 

1145
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:37,166
We have to follow Vijay to know what he told him. 

1146
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:42,833
Shivram, adopt a twisted way to collect proofs. 

1147
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:51,375
Anand, tell me where are we going? - I will tell you. 

1148
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:55,250
But tell me what day is it? - Today is a special day. 

1149
01:40:55,333 --> 01:41:00,708
Special? - Do you remember? - Stop joking, friend. Tell me. 

1150
01:41:00,958 --> 01:41:04,791
Don't try to hide everything from me all the time, friend. 

1151
01:41:06,666 --> 01:41:07,791
 What? 

1152
01:41:07,875 --> 01:41:12,375
The thing that today is your birthday. - How do you know? 

1153
01:41:12,791 --> 01:41:15,416
 I am policeman so I know everything. 

1154
01:41:16,375 --> 01:41:19,916
I like your kind of work. I am satisfied. 

1155
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:24,375
We 2 will celebrate your birthday for the first time together. 

1156
01:41:24,625 --> 01:41:26,583
 In a very special place. 

1157
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:34,166
You were about to being me to this special place. 

1158
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:39,791
Don't you like the place? I don't like facing Jasmine. 

1159
01:41:47,875 --> 01:41:50,708
Vijay, I will be able to meet her if you stay with me. 

1160
01:41:50,958 --> 01:41:54,250
Thinking this I have brought you along. 

1161
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:04,083
 Hi. Good evening. 

1162
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:09,958
Good evening. - Okay, get ready for the surprise. 

1163
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,125
 Come on. 

1164
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,458
 What is this? Cake and candles. 

1165
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,208
 Is it someone's birthday? 

1166
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,791
 I won't tell you whose birthday it is. 

1167
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:26,041
His secret he has concealed from everyone has been revealed. 

1168
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:27,750
 Isn't it, Vijay? 

1169
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:32,958
We thought we will celebrate here as you have come to know. 

1170
01:42:35,208 --> 01:42:39,500
Hey, I forgot the lighter. Do you have matches? 

1171
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,583
I need some plates and glasses too. I will get them. 

1172
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,708
The kitchen Is not there. Wait a minute. I will get it. 

1173
01:42:47,791 --> 01:42:51,000
I will get it. - No, the kitchen is dirty. I will get it. - I don't mind. 

1174
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:52,916
No, it's okay. - Okay. 

1175
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,125
 As you wish. 

1176
01:42:57,208 --> 01:43:01,250
 Wow, not bad. Happy birthday Vijay. 

1177
01:43:03,791 --> 01:43:06,166
 My god. I have forgotten something. 

1178
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:08,541
Vijay I have another bag in my car which contains.. 

1179
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:10,666
..a bottle orange juice and 3 cans of beer. 

1180
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:13,291
 Sorry, with your permission. Catch. 

1181
01:43:14,041 --> 01:43:16,541
Till I fix them. You go and get everything. 

1182
01:43:17,083 --> 01:43:20,666
Friend, you have to do something on your birthday. 

1183
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:21,916
 Go. 

1184
01:43:24,333 --> 01:43:25,916
 Shall I give you a compliment? 

1185
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,166
 May I ask you something? 

1186
01:43:32,833 --> 01:43:37,125
Jasmine you look nice in spectacles. Nice frame. 

1187
01:43:38,916 --> 01:43:40,041
 Can I have a look? 

1188
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:43,500
 Please. 

1189
01:44:03,625 --> 01:44:05,416
Look, there is the person who has killed justice Menon. 

1190
01:44:10,791 --> 01:44:11,958
 Come on, tell me. 

1191
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,208
 Come on, tell me. 

1192
01:44:20,125 --> 01:44:21,458
 I know you can recognise him. 

1193
01:44:23,083 --> 01:44:24,833
 No, I don't. 

1194
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:27,958
 My spectacles please. 

1195
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,416
You don't know. - Have you gone mad? 

1196
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:32,166
 Your cunningness won't work. 

1197
01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:35,583
 So even you are a part of this ploy. 

1198
01:44:36,125 --> 01:44:38,833
I know how to make you speak the truth? 

1199
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:40,500
Do you want to see? Come with me. - Anand. 

1200
01:44:40,958 --> 01:44:42,041
 Let her go. 

1201
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:46,458
 Jasmine, go inside. 

1202
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:56,291
I salute you. I like your way of finding the killer. 

1203
01:44:56,625 --> 01:45:01,875
The way you tried to trap me on the basis of proofs is praiseworthy. 

1204
01:45:02,416 --> 01:45:07,000
The ploy you adopted to prove me murderer was brilliant. 

1205
01:45:07,875 --> 01:45:09,541
 But you made a mistake. 

1206
01:45:10,375 --> 01:45:16,250
A girl who loves can betray herself but never her lover. 

1207
01:45:17,708 --> 01:45:19,666
 The story doesn't end here. 

1208
01:45:20,833 --> 01:45:22,541
 There are still 2 men in the hit list. 

1209
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:24,208
 Sachitanand and I.K. Thomas. 

1210
01:45:26,541 --> 01:45:29,041
 I won't let them get hurt. 

1211
01:45:29,916 --> 01:45:32,250
 Then prove your masculinity. 

1212
01:45:34,291 --> 01:45:35,416
 Good night. 

1213
01:45:49,708 --> 01:45:50,833
 Sorry. 

1214
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:59,750
I won't bother you anymore. I will take him away. 

1215
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:20,541
Come here. Appoint 4 men at the departure. - Sir. 

1216
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:22,541
And block the path there. - Yes, sir. - Go. 

1217
01:46:23,708 --> 01:46:25,375
Have you appointed men at the V.I.P. lounge? 

1218
01:46:25,458 --> 01:46:27,541
I have appointed 6 men there and Sharif is their in-charge. 

1219
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:29,250
It is good that even the minister is coming. 

1220
01:46:29,333 --> 01:46:30,541
Otherwise how could we have covered this police.. 

1221
01:46:30,625 --> 01:46:34,416
..protection for Sachitanand and I.K. Thomas. - Leave it. 

1222
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,166
Shivram. - Sir. 

1223
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:48,375
Our jeep should follow Sachitanand and I.K. Thomas' car. - Sir. 

1224
01:46:48,583 --> 01:46:50,333
There should be full police protection at.. 

1225
01:46:50,416 --> 01:46:52,250
..Sachitanand's press conference tomorrow. - Sir. 

1226
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,875
You are airport staff. - Yes, sir. - Show your I.D. 

1227
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:13,333
 Sir. 

1228
01:47:16,958 --> 01:47:18,541
What happened? Anand? Is everything okay? 

1229
01:47:19,458 --> 01:47:21,041
How are you, Anand? - Fine sir. 

1230
01:48:02,833 --> 01:48:06,291
 Vijay. No. Stop it. Stop it. 

1231
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:07,708
 Freddy. 

1232
01:48:10,333 --> 01:48:12,791
 So you pity me. 

1233
01:48:13,166 --> 01:48:18,291
When I told you about myself I told you clearly not to stop me. 

1234
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:20,541
You cannot extinguish my fire of revenge. 

1235
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:24,000
Vijay, why are you playing with fire consciously? 

1236
01:48:24,166 --> 01:48:25,333
 Fire. 

1237
01:48:26,416 --> 01:48:28,625
 You are right. You are right. 

1238
01:48:28,875 --> 01:48:31,791
I will do what I have to do now. Don't stop me. 

1239
01:48:32,291 --> 01:48:34,041
Understand? - Vijay. 

1240
01:48:44,125 --> 01:48:45,416
 Is everything okay? 

1241
01:49:46,791 --> 01:49:48,541
What is so special about today's conference.. 

1242
01:49:48,625 --> 01:49:52,041
..that the police is so ready? We don't even have bombs. 

1243
01:49:52,125 --> 01:49:56,250
An anonymous call came. We were threatened. 

1244
01:49:56,666 --> 01:50:01,541
You can delay a train or cancel a plane if you have a rupee. 

1245
01:50:01,625 --> 01:50:04,916
All of us can face problems because of this. So please. 

1246
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,250
 Okay sir. 

1247
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:15,250
Shivram. - Sir. - Don't be fooled by anyone's face. 

1248
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:18,958
Sir. - Check all the cars properly. - Okay sir, okay. 

1249
01:50:40,875 --> 01:50:43,583
Hello. - Hello. - What is the matter? So much police. 

1250
01:50:43,875 --> 01:50:45,541
 Sir, it is nothing like that. 

1251
01:50:45,833 --> 01:50:48,250
We were called and threatened that something will happen. 

1252
01:50:48,791 --> 01:50:51,333
There is no need to worry but the police have to do their duty. 

1253
01:50:51,416 --> 01:50:52,541
Sure, okay. - Please. 

1254
01:51:13,958 --> 01:51:17,208
Excuse me, open the box. - Its not my problem. 

1255
01:51:17,458 --> 01:51:20,791
See it yourself. - That too. 

1256
01:52:01,375 --> 01:52:03,541
 The government has tried to make.. 

1257
01:52:03,625 --> 01:52:07,208
..our old customized business into new. 

1258
01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:12,333
And the help extended to traders is an example. 

1259
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,541
I want to take advantage of this chance.. 

1260
01:52:14,625 --> 01:52:18,458
..so that I can adopt the new tactics of Sach company. 

1261
01:52:18,875 --> 01:52:22,750
What do you want to say? - I will tell you about it. 

1262
01:52:22,833 --> 01:52:26,541
I know very well that you went to avoid your illegal case.. 

1263
01:52:26,625 --> 01:52:29,541
..than to promote small scale industries.. 

1264
01:52:29,625 --> 01:52:32,791
..in your foreign trip with I.K. Thomas and the minister 

1265
01:52:34,458 --> 01:52:35,750
 What are you saying? 

1266
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:39,416
I and I.K. Thomas went to tour Europe with the minister. 

1267
01:52:39,625 --> 01:52:41,083
 No, it is not like that. 

1268
01:52:41,458 --> 01:52:43,333
All right my friend. Shall I ask you something? 

1269
01:52:43,791 --> 01:52:47,916
Nearly 2,000 people board the Rajdhani express from Mumbai. 

1270
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
 Do all of them go to tour? 

1271
01:52:50,083 --> 01:52:52,833
It was my bad luck that the minister was in my plane. 

1272
01:52:52,916 --> 01:52:54,041
 Yes, it is true. 

1273
01:52:54,416 --> 01:52:57,750
Shivram. - But this is true too. - Which? 

1274
01:52:57,833 --> 01:53:01,458
Illegal wine is being prepared in your cold drink factory. 

1275
01:53:01,541 --> 01:53:02,625
 Who said so? 

1276
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:05,833
 I saw a news report on TV. 

1277
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:13,208
 It is right. A story. A tall story. 

1278
01:53:13,625 --> 01:53:17,208
Now it is the age of great mega serials. 

1279
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:21,000
Even news based programs are like mega serials. 

1280
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:25,291
A little tears, violence. And a climax. 

1281
01:53:25,666 --> 01:53:27,583
 They used to show the truth before. 

1282
01:53:27,666 --> 01:53:33,291
Such programs should find sponsors to tie the public. 

1283
01:53:33,541 --> 01:53:36,958
 I have no problems with such channels. 

1284
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,750
 They do it for their stomach. 

1285
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
 And what we saw on TV? 

1286
01:53:42,083 --> 01:53:43,750
 They saw a lot on TV. 

1287
01:53:44,041 --> 01:53:48,500
They make tall stories and try to defame me. 

1288
01:53:54,458 --> 01:53:56,000
Shivram. - Sir. 

1289
01:54:03,416 --> 01:54:05,250
 Actually.. 

1290
01:54:05,333 --> 01:54:09,000
We tell the true news which other channels don't show. 

1291
01:54:09,041 --> 01:54:11,833
That's' why the name of your channel is True Vision. 

1292
01:54:12,583 --> 01:54:15,000
 Where there is no bad thing or fear. 

1293
01:54:15,625 --> 01:54:19,166
Your bottling factory produces fake wine worth lakhs. 

1294
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:22,541
And this is sent by stealth in the company tankers. 

1295
01:54:23,375 --> 01:54:28,541
The wine flowing in your advanced distillery pipes.. 

1296
01:54:28,625 --> 01:54:31,916
 ..amazes the innocent public here. 

1297
01:54:32,125 --> 01:54:37,208
And Sachitanand can you falsify the truth seen by the eyes. 

1298
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,083
 Listen. 

1299
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:44,541
And first think about the loss of yearly subsidy quota.. 

1300
01:54:44,625 --> 01:54:47,541
..you get for the raw material needed in your chemical.. 

1301
01:54:47,625 --> 01:54:50,458
..factory that you have been doing continuously. 

1302
01:54:50,708 --> 01:54:52,250
 Nearly 8 crores. 

1303
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,291
 What happened? 

1304
01:54:55,541 --> 01:54:59,916
Don't try to scare Sachitanand with your big lectures. 

1305
01:55:00,208 --> 01:55:04,250
I know what your problem is. And I have its remedy too. 

1306
01:55:11,666 --> 01:55:14,750
Hello, John. What happened to the camera? 

1307
01:55:24,708 --> 01:55:26,000
 I.. I.. 

1308
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:52,041
What happened? - Move back. Side please. Move back. 

1309
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:56,083
Move back. - Move back. Side please. Move back. 

1310
01:56:15,416 --> 01:56:16,791
 You are under arrest. 

1311
01:56:17,125 --> 01:56:18,333
 What for? 

1312
01:56:21,208 --> 01:56:24,000
 Sir, Sachitanand's post mortem report. 

1313
01:56:30,916 --> 01:56:35,000
Heart attack. Immediate death due to cardiac arrest. 

1314
01:56:36,666 --> 01:56:38,375
Then why have you arrested, Vijay? - Shut up. 

1315
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:42,208
Shut up, I say. Do you want me to believe this report? 

1316
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:50,916
 Hello. Sir. Sir, I have read it. 

1317
01:56:52,458 --> 01:56:54,208
 But the report can be wrong. 

1318
01:56:55,916 --> 01:56:59,291
 Sir. Okay sir. 

1319
01:57:02,833 --> 01:57:05,166
After all Vijay is the TV channels' special man. 

1320
01:57:05,416 --> 01:57:08,416
I can lose my post for accusing him falsely. 

1321
01:57:09,583 --> 01:57:10,916
 Shivram, release him. 

1322
01:57:16,125 --> 01:57:19,541
Vijay, the post mortem report has arrived. - Heart attack. 

1323
01:57:19,875 --> 01:57:22,000
 You have got the news so quickly. 

1324
01:57:22,208 --> 01:57:25,833
All right if you don't mind write a statement. 

1325
01:57:26,041 --> 01:57:28,166
 That the police have not touched you. 

1326
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:30,625
Otherwise Anand's job will be in danger. 

1327
01:57:47,208 --> 01:57:50,250
Shivram, I will leave. - Okay sir. We will meet again. 

1328
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:05,750
But sir it wasn't right for Sachitanand to die suddenly now. 

1329
01:58:05,958 --> 01:58:09,125
It is a great loss for us. - Stop your nonsense. 

1330
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:12,125
Don't spoil your brains by thinking about the dead. 

1331
01:58:12,875 --> 01:58:16,458
I have got the last chance to be the minister, understand? 

1332
01:58:16,958 --> 01:58:19,291
 It will be good if you support me. 

1333
01:58:19,541 --> 01:58:22,416
Sir, you are right. - One thing is true. 

1334
01:58:22,666 --> 01:58:27,958
After our rally even the God from heavens cannot defeat you. 

1335
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,916
We will get all the people required for the rally, sir. 

1336
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,375
But it will be very expensive sir. That's why take care. 

1337
01:58:34,458 --> 01:58:36,041
 Don't worry about money. 

1338
01:58:36,125 --> 01:58:39,083
 You will get all the money you want. 

1339
01:58:41,125 --> 01:58:44,541
And I have formed another party to collect those.. 

1340
01:58:44,875 --> 01:58:48,458
 ..who have separated from us. 

1341
01:58:49,416 --> 01:58:55,791
But I don't know who is the enemy, to hurt me and my party? 

1342
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
 We have found the enemy. 

1343
01:58:58,375 --> 01:59:01,708
I have found Shivram sir's personal file. 

1344
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:05,541
In which sir has written about the one who has killed.. 

1345
01:59:05,625 --> 01:59:08,416
..Justice Menon, D.I.G. Mohan and Sachitanand. 

1346
01:59:10,791 --> 01:59:16,666
Sir you will profit hugely from this file. - Come. 

1347
01:59:26,041 --> 01:59:30,625
There is no use of me telling anything now. 

1348
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:34,375
 But Vijay.. 

1349
01:59:35,208 --> 01:59:40,041
No, don't talk about what is not required. 

1350
01:59:41,875 --> 01:59:44,291
 I will have to complete my task. 

1351
01:59:45,583 --> 01:59:47,250
 For God's sake forgive me. 

1352
01:59:48,875 --> 01:59:53,625
In future maybe I won't get the chance to meet you. 

1353
01:59:54,458 --> 01:59:59,708
 When I think about it I regret it. 

1354
02:00:01,041 --> 02:00:05,916
But even if I want I can't do anything for you. 

1355
02:00:07,041 --> 02:00:11,791
I just had this wish. Whatever I loved.. 

1356
02:00:14,416 --> 02:00:22,625
Leave it. I am habituated now. - I am leaving. 

1357
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,000
 I can't wish you this time. 

1358
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:01,541
Who are you? Who are you? How did you come inside? 

1359
02:01:01,625 --> 02:01:02,958
How did you come inside? - Move aside. 

1360
02:01:03,416 --> 02:01:07,375
Where is he? Tell me, where is he? - Who? 

1361
02:01:08,333 --> 02:01:13,625
Drop the act. I am the one who is kind to women. 

1362
02:01:13,958 --> 02:01:16,083
 Find and bring him out. 

1363
02:01:21,708 --> 02:01:24,375
It will do good if you are decent with me. 

1364
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:28,041
Otherwise you will cry forever as a woman. Understand? 

1365
02:01:29,708 --> 02:01:32,375
 Tell me the truth now. 

1366
02:01:32,583 --> 02:01:34,541
Where is retired head constable Chandra Naik.. 

1367
02:01:34,625 --> 02:01:37,250
 ..whom Vijay has concealed? 

1368
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:38,916
 Truly. No one has come here. 

1369
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:46,375
You don't want to tell the truth you have seen.. 

1370
02:01:46,708 --> 02:01:49,791
..with your weak eyes so that you can save Vijay. 

1371
02:01:50,041 --> 02:01:51,375
 You are wrong. 

1372
02:01:52,583 --> 02:02:00,041
You are wrong if you want to defame I.K. with a small channel. 

1373
02:02:00,916 --> 02:02:03,041
 I have stamped his death. 

1374
02:02:03,666 --> 02:02:06,041
 His destiny is death. 

1375
02:02:07,166 --> 02:02:09,916
 Pray to all your Gods and Goddesses. 

1376
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,791
So that you don't have to meet I.K. again. 

1377
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,125
 And if you face him again.. 

1378
02:02:21,375 --> 02:02:24,958
Then bells of death will ring in your ears. 

1379
02:02:25,333 --> 02:02:26,750
 A whisper of death. 

1380
02:02:28,416 --> 02:02:32,000
 Go. And pray for Vijay's soul. 

1381
02:02:49,208 --> 02:02:51,208
 Look, is everything right? 

1382
02:03:03,166 --> 02:03:04,875
 No. no. Let him go. 

1383
02:03:25,291 --> 02:03:27,208
 No, let me go. 

1384
02:03:40,083 --> 02:03:42,791
 Let me go. Let me go. 

1385
02:04:27,875 --> 02:04:29,125
 Freddie. 

1386
02:04:29,208 --> 02:04:30,500
 Freddie. 

1387
02:04:52,416 --> 02:04:56,416
Greetings, Chandra Naik. We have met after many years. 

1388
02:04:56,833 --> 02:05:00,166
It is nearly 10-20 years, right. Is it okay? 

1389
02:05:00,666 --> 02:05:02,333
 What happened if it is 20 years? 

1390
02:05:02,750 --> 02:05:07,791
I never forget the one who works for me once. 

1391
02:05:08,375 --> 02:05:11,500
 You helped me for many years. 

1392
02:05:11,916 --> 02:05:13,541
 Only Chandra Naik was the person.. 

1393
02:05:13,625 --> 02:05:16,708
..who concealed my secret for 20 years. 

1394
02:05:16,791 --> 02:05:19,166
But now you have committed a mistake? Isn't it? 

1395
02:05:19,541 --> 02:05:20,958
 I am not the old Chandra Naik.. 

1396
02:05:21,166 --> 02:05:25,208
..who used to be scared of your threatening? 

1397
02:05:25,541 --> 02:05:27,916
 If you want you can me too. 

1398
02:05:28,166 --> 02:05:34,291
Madavan sir's son is there to account for it. - I know. 

1399
02:05:34,583 --> 02:05:40,166
But I do what I say. Now it is not right for me if you live. 

1400
02:05:42,916 --> 02:05:45,291
 One last settlement. 

1401
02:06:04,541 --> 02:06:08,375
Jasmine. Both of us know you won't tell. 

1402
02:06:08,833 --> 02:06:14,291
Vijay who is like brother to me has killed 3 people. 

1403
02:06:14,500 --> 02:06:18,416
And now he is looking for the 4th. And that is I.K. Thomas. 

1404
02:06:18,875 --> 02:06:24,625
Naturally they are V.I.P. men Jasmine. I can save you. 

1405
02:06:24,708 --> 02:06:27,750
Give it to me in writing that they have threatened to kill you. 

1406
02:06:27,833 --> 02:06:31,666
Tell me the truth. Otherwise Vijay will kill Thomas. 

1407
02:06:32,041 --> 02:06:34,000
Or Thomas will kill Vijay. - No! 

1408
02:06:35,375 --> 02:06:40,708
Listen carefully. You have only one way to save Vijay. 

1409
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:47,291
Either tell me or the law and let the law take its course. 

1410
02:06:54,250 --> 02:06:56,208
Hello. - Sir, this is me. 

1411
02:06:56,750 --> 02:06:59,333
 Someone has killed Chandra Naik. 

1412
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,666
We have found the body at level cross road. 

1413
02:07:07,333 --> 02:07:10,166
All right. I am coming. You stay there. 

1414
02:07:12,458 --> 02:07:16,375
I know. Vijay won't do anything wrong consciously. 

1415
02:07:16,958 --> 02:07:20,875
Chandra Naik will bear witness to prove Vijay right. 

1416
02:07:21,416 --> 02:07:23,416
 Chandra Naik. 

1417
02:07:23,666 --> 02:07:25,875
 All right, listen to the truth. 

1418
02:07:26,750 --> 02:07:31,750
Jasmine's witness is recorded in this video cassette. 

1419
02:07:35,958 --> 02:07:39,833
Sir, don't be angry. I am not speaking for Vijay. 

1420
02:07:39,916 --> 02:07:43,625
But if a criminal like I.K. Thomas escapes and stays a patriot. 

1421
02:07:43,916 --> 02:07:48,041
Acts and collects young men and comes to power. 

1422
02:07:48,125 --> 02:07:50,500
If this happens what will the public do. 

1423
02:07:50,791 --> 02:07:54,375
We policemen have to salute that traitor. 

1424
02:07:54,666 --> 02:07:57,791
 Just watch who salutes whom. 

1425
02:07:57,875 --> 02:08:01,541
We cannot hurt a moneyed and powerful man like I.K. Thomas. 

1426
02:08:03,083 --> 02:08:04,291
 Wait and see. 

1427
02:08:11,583 --> 02:08:14,541
Thomas is wrong if he thinks he will escape.. 

1428
02:08:14,625 --> 02:08:16,541
..by killing Chandra Naik. - What do we do now, sir? 

1429
02:08:16,625 --> 02:08:18,791
I have heard he has organised a big rally. 

1430
02:08:23,625 --> 02:08:27,666
His wish to win the election again won't be fulfilled. 

1431
02:08:28,208 --> 02:08:30,875
 He can't fool the public this time. 

1432
02:08:31,125 --> 02:08:35,208
I won't spare him at any cost. And I mean it. 

1433
02:08:42,416 --> 02:08:45,625
The bad things that happens in this country. 

1434
02:08:45,708 --> 02:08:48,541
Even after freedom this country is not free. 

1435
02:08:48,625 --> 02:08:54,000
And the way I.K. Thomas collected the youth and tried. 

1436
02:08:54,083 --> 02:08:58,291
I welcome him for that. Welcome him with applause. 

1437
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,333
 Down with I.K. Thomas. 

1438
02:09:01,416 --> 02:09:05,541
Down with I.K. Thomas. Down with I.K. Thomas. 

1439
02:09:05,625 --> 02:09:07,541
 Down with I.K. Thomas. 

1440
02:09:07,625 --> 02:09:13,625
Irritated with his party's wrong deeds he has left it 3 years ago. 

1441
02:09:13,708 --> 02:09:19,333
So now I.K. Thomas has established his own party. 

1442
02:09:19,416 --> 02:09:21,583
 That's why welcome him. 

1443
02:09:38,625 --> 02:09:41,125
Dear audience. Greetings to all of you. 

1444
02:09:41,208 --> 02:09:45,333
Down with I.K. Thomas. Down with I.K. Thomas. 

1445
02:09:48,750 --> 02:09:53,541
 The collection of youths is new.. 

1446
02:09:53,625 --> 02:09:57,708
..episode in India's history. It is a change. 

1447
02:09:57,791 --> 02:10:01,166
 Down with I.K. Thomas. 

1448
02:10:02,125 --> 02:10:04,000
 Politics is an open stage. 

1449
02:10:04,458 --> 02:10:09,250
But that doesn't mean that anyone can come. 

1450
02:10:09,458 --> 02:10:11,500
 You need ability for it. 

1451
02:10:16,791 --> 02:10:19,541
Nothing can be acquired by burning my effigy. 

1452
02:10:19,625 --> 02:10:23,250
The truth is India's future is connected.. 

1453
02:10:23,333 --> 02:10:27,875
 ..with today's youth and not politics. 

1454
02:10:31,708 --> 02:10:36,541
I am lucky today that I can encourage.. 

1455
02:10:36,625 --> 02:10:41,625
 ..patriotism among the deviated youth. 

1456
02:10:41,708 --> 02:10:44,958
This is the biggest day of my political life. 

1457
02:10:45,208 --> 02:10:49,000
 Hail I. K, Thomas. 

1458
02:10:54,708 --> 02:11:02,166
Today you are sitting and listening.. Hello. 

1459
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,208
 Hello. 

1460
02:11:09,083 --> 02:11:11,583
 Welcome to True Vision. Greetings. 

1461
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:15,541
Thank you that you for came to save this country.. 

1462
02:11:15,625 --> 02:11:19,000
..by finding time from your busy schedule. 

1463
02:11:20,916 --> 02:11:23,333
Today you have come to listen something. 

1464
02:11:23,416 --> 02:11:29,666
Maybe you don't know the reality of patriot I.K. Thomas. 

1465
02:11:29,916 --> 02:11:33,416
Today I will reveal all the doings of this social worker. 

1466
02:11:35,583 --> 02:11:38,541
Before telling this truth to you, retired constable.. 

1467
02:11:38,625 --> 02:11:42,000
 ..Chandra Naik was killed 3 days ago. 

1468
02:11:42,916 --> 02:11:48,000
And now I am going to let you hear his truth. Listen properly. 

1469
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:54,833
 I am only scared of my soul. 

1470
02:11:54,916 --> 02:12:00,000
But I want to tell everything and unburden my soul. 

1471
02:12:08,208 --> 02:12:11,000
 Down with I.K. Thomas. 

1472
02:12:11,083 --> 02:12:13,750
 Down with I.K. Thomas. 

1473
02:12:13,833 --> 02:12:15,791
Among the people who did bad work were.. 

1474
02:12:15,875 --> 02:12:18,125
 ..retired justice Chandrasekhar Menon. 

1475
02:12:18,833 --> 02:12:21,666
 Retired DGP R.R. Mohan. 

1476
02:12:22,208 --> 02:12:23,875
 Wine seller Sachitanand. 

1477
02:12:24,458 --> 02:12:27,416
 These 3 have died till now. 

1478
02:12:28,708 --> 02:12:32,500
And now only one man is left. I.K. Thomas. 

1479
02:12:32,708 --> 02:12:34,125
 And he will be killed too today. 

1480
02:12:44,333 --> 02:12:47,250
Mr. Anand. You have come at the right time. 

1481
02:12:48,291 --> 02:12:51,250
 The murderer Vijay is here somewhere. 

1482
02:12:51,333 --> 02:12:53,208
 He had adjourned my meeting. 

1483
02:12:53,291 --> 02:12:55,375
 And has threatened to kill me. 

1484
02:12:56,291 --> 02:12:58,416
 Find and arrest him. 

1485
02:13:01,833 --> 02:13:04,083
 Hail I.K. Thomas. 

1486
02:13:04,166 --> 02:13:06,375
 Please, listen to me. 

1487
02:13:06,458 --> 02:13:07,791
 The criminal won't escape. 

1488
02:13:07,875 --> 02:13:09,791
 Arrest Vijay. 

1489
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,750
 We will arrest Vijay at any cost. 

1490
02:13:13,166 --> 02:13:15,333
 I will have to arrest you now. 

1491
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:20,000
 What are you saying, Mr. Anand? 

1492
02:13:20,458 --> 02:13:23,208
You will be foolish enough to arrest me.. 

1493
02:13:23,291 --> 02:13:26,750
 ..by hearing a murderer's false story. 

1494
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:32,208
Or are you acting to save your friend Vijay. Well. 

1495
02:13:32,291 --> 02:13:36,125
Hail I.K. Thomas. - Hail him. 

1496
02:13:36,208 --> 02:13:40,541
But will my supporters and my believers won't spare you alive. 

1497
02:13:40,625 --> 02:13:43,541
Hail I.K. Thomas. - Hail him. 

1498
02:13:43,625 --> 02:13:47,166
Hail I.K. Thomas. - Hail him. 

1499
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,375
 I know you trust me. 

1500
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,750
I don't know Chandra Naik who told this tall story. 

1501
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,083
 But Freddie knows. 

1502
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:59,291
You have killed Chandra Naik and he is the witness. 

1503
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:03,875
And your partner Jhon Vargis has supported you in this murder. 

1504
02:14:11,083 --> 02:14:13,250
 Now, shall I take you into custody? 

1505
02:14:15,791 --> 02:14:19,833
Shivram. - Sir. - Give him the warrant. - Yes, sir. 

1506
02:15:38,916 --> 02:15:42,375
I knew I will get you after my long wait. 

1507
02:15:42,583 --> 02:15:47,208
I won't handover I.K. Thomas to law now. 

1508
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:49,250
 Your fate is sealed. 

1509
02:17:41,875 --> 02:17:45,541
Don't beat me. - You will tell your reality to your.. 

1510
02:17:45,625 --> 02:17:49,291
 ..party people about your reality. 

1511
02:17:49,583 --> 02:17:53,083
And tell everyone about your misdeeds yourself. Come. 

1512
02:17:56,833 --> 02:18:01,791
No. I will tell. I will tell everything. 

1513
02:18:09,708 --> 02:18:12,125
 Whatever Chandra Naik said was true. 

1514
02:18:15,041 --> 02:18:18,625
 I trapped Madhavan's wife Sridevi. 

1515
02:18:19,666 --> 02:18:23,541
I am the one who made Chandra Naik kill Madhavan. 

1516
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
 I accept all my crimes.
