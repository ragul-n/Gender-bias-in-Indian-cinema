The little bird sang happily when

and sowed little millets in the fields

5
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:22,309
as much as a hill when harvested
only in a pot when collected

6
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:28,318

fish from river Meenachilar.

12
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:29,340
As the shyness of the soil when it rains
as the currency of golden flower fill lap

13
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,975
The whole hill was flowered.

Hello, how is your business ?

00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,663
Not bad.
Not this, that one l want.

Why do you sit so?

41
00:05:49,515 --> 00:06:02,189
l was simply calculating, if we arrange 6 loads
Jose will give big amount, for demand is high now

42
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:08,901
lt will be enough to meet dowery debts of
Lilly and other debts of bank.

43
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:14,802
You see, then l will celebrate
by taking 5 or 6 lakhs from it .

44
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:19,177
Stop it . You always speak about money.

45
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:35,785
He never changes his price; if fixed once
nobody can influence him.That's his quality.

46
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,192
lf no other way l will reveal it....

my father if l seek favour of Thevar.

Then you were sheltered by an old
bootlegger do you remember ?

Then told me congratulations...

331
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,191
Kattithara Paappachan's ''diplomat'' is

337
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:46,734

Save God.

535
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,678
Eeppachan.. What l was saying...

536
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:48,748
No, Commissioner if any poor fellow sells illicit
liquour for livelihood in my range

537
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,876
l will ignore it

538
00:44:51,622 --> 00:45:00,189
But Kadayadi Ragahavan,Baby,Kunnel Maathan
and their KK group enters into my range

539
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:06,526
then l don't want the aid of Exicise
l will finish it myself.. you understand..

540
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,299
and no Compromise

541
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:12,700
l say this to avoid any further clashes....please

542
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,033
there is call for you..

543
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:23,211
Bishop... please hold on
Eappachan has just gone to latrine

544
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,815
what is it ?
New Bishop from Curia

545
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,283
he has some irritation with piles

546
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,422
Now you yourself speak to him

547
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:35,388
Bishop, he has come back.. l will give to him

548
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:41,026
lts Eeppan...oh l will come there and meet you

549
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:09,388
lnfact , anybody can ask what a Bishop has to do
with liquour trade

550
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,395
lsn't it Mr.Pappachan ?

551
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,531
That..... your Excellence

552
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:20,536
but, many of rich liquour traders
are members of church

553
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,835
isn't it Mr.Mattchan ?
yes

554
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,540
ln that way liquour trade
is a church subject.

555
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,610
Have you any different opinion for Outha Kutty ?

556
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,520
l have no opinion beyond my father.

557
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:33,686
What about Chandy ?

558
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,484
Or you too have your Brother's opinion ?

559
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,488
yes

560
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:41,861
Then in the liquour trade this poor bishop can also...
.... get involved

561
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:51,969
No.l don't drink, not only infront of the Bishops
but also on the other occassions too.

562
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:53,368
This is like a...

563
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,914
did you hear what l was saying ..
yes.

564
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,408
on the one side Eappachan alone

565
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,213
on the other Kunneel Mattchan
and Kadayadi Group

566
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:10,258
lts almost 15 years over you both
fight in this liquour zone.

567
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,527
all these years victory was with Eappachan

568
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,522
Both they and Kadayadi have always failed.

569
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,165
but this time they too are very obstinate Eappachan

570
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:27,308
if you come for auction this time ,they are prepared
to get you down at any cost.

571
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,646
So, don't go for non violence means..

572
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,111
if necessary we will even do that...

573
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:33,041
OuthaKutty.

574
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:39,046
didn't you hear, they are very hot tempered.

575
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:41,122
Aren't you satisfied yet Eappachan ?

576
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:46,218
even after holding the whole ranges in
middles travencore for 40 years.

577
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:47,889
now you please stop it.

578
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,365
let them also have opportunities..

579
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,624
They too are the members of the same church..

580
00:47:54,638 --> 00:48:00,543
Ottaplamootil Sosa, this Outhakutty's
mother in law

581
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:06,312
she is still your sister althouh you
wore this attair isn't it ?

582
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:07,242
How idiotic ?

583
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:11,482
Eappachan, l just thought to avoid hatred between
two prominent fellows in the community

584
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,287
but, You terribly insulted me

585
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,057
To know the value of this cassak

586
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:23,155
its not enough to feed the poor with the
money you earn through illicit liquour trade

587
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,328
should own a hereditary
like them

588
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,195
Should have a genuine genus

589
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:28,963
must have a dignified family status

590
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,532
At least, should be literate

591
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,145
you are but too irreverant and outspoken.

592
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:42,513
Its true Bishop ; Eappachan has notgone to school.

593
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,749
my father was a wood cutter

594
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:49,526
l was 9 years old, when my father
was taken to jail

595
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:53,792
for killing a ranger officer for molesting my mother

596
00:48:54,965 --> 00:49:02,167
lt was on my 10th birthday l
received my father's body from the scaffold

597
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:06,906
when l brought my father on the third day
infront of this church

598
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:14,679
still l can see worms,that had in
father's nose and mouth

599
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:21,787
That day Bishops, wore like this attaire asked
to take his body to rascal's graveyard.

600
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,493
That day l lost respect for this white dress of those

601
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:31,131
who feed on other's sweat and travel
in Benz & contessa

602
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,970
Now to that my attitude is that
you explained in English

603
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,235
what is it ?
you noded your head when it was said

604
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:43,269

lts true.. then feeding beggars
on liquour trade ...that is also a story...

608
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:59,295
after burrying mother in the left side
of my father at the age of 11

609
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,693
when l reached in the forest crossing
Meenalichar to begin boot legginh

610
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:10,100
Today's this Abkari King was given money
to buy equipments not by church or priests

611
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:14,404
but a mad woman, who roamed through the street

612
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:20,010
lts in remembrance of that l feed the poor.

Quality of genus.

622

00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:39,692
Have you Cigarattes ?

690
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,576
Then you are from a rich family.

other wise no need l will keep it.

694
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:58,119
otherwise l have to look for
matches to others

695
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,897
Very good police...!
Get the jeep

696
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:24,672
Then, Eappachayan won't come on our way
instead of Bishop even if Pope himself say

697
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:30,278
Eappachayan..# There is no limit for
the abuse that scoundral showered on me

698
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,621
that even infront of my children

699
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,252
Let time come Mattacha..
we will deal all the accounts

700
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,127
What is your stand in this matter Pappichayn ?

701
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:43,796
l am telling it..Baby.

702
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:50,032
Last time after the arrack auction
when you confessed everything

703
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:55,542
He gave you generously his
Kollam & Pathanamtitta

704
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:58,036
what you did in lieu was sheer cheating

705
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:01,479
finally,when Eappachayan asked to
close the arrears of Kist

706
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,850
MLA, don't you remember ?

707
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:06,154
All these fellowsjust walked away like this.

708
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,319
Behave yourself...

709
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:08,586
l was explaining

710
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,721
lt is enough to explain
don't exhibit..-Yes

711
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:18,391
By helping every one Eappachayan
lost One and half crores

712
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:20,226
One and half crores...!

713
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:28,609
You should remember how much you and
sadasivan got out of that one and half crores.

714
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:29,737
that....

715
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,602
don't leave it now...

716
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,183
Eleven + Eleven, twenty two lakhs.

717
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,415
we divided only the rest.
that...

718
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:38,845
stop it

719
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:46,422
come on say Baby, should we give it
Aanakattil Eappachn this time too..?

720
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:52,100
or should we fight ? what should we do
decided it by yourself.

721
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:57,297
Aword is enouh from you,Kunnel Mattechan
and sons are redy to even kill or die.

722
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,236
wait... Outhakutty.

723
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,440
most probably,Minister CK will reach here

724
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:06,348
a final round discussion after that
we shall decide whether to kill or die.

725
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:13,618
don't be afraid, the intelligent abkari king
still trust you, don't loose it.

726
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:20,321
Pappachan,stay in two boats like this
we will protect you without tearing legs

727
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:29,104
Hello,No..no..its Thambi Ok..

728
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,906
minister's PA. Programme is confirmed.

729
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:36,309
Ragavan, l can directly and indirectly
involve in liquour business

730
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:40,945
But,There are many allegations against me
both in the Assembly and out

731
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,347
so if you are for a direct fighting with Eappachan...

732
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:52,422
There was a time for comrade Balakrishan
when you were in opposition

733
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:59,764
That time we supported your son,daughter
son-in-law and others in Abkari field,don't forget it..

734
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,261
l haven't forgotten anything

735
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:06,399
whether you forget or not..today,from
Eranakulam to Manjeshram you are no.1

736
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:14,145
Eappan in south, finally we, who helped you
lame as there is nowhere to place a foot.

737
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,510
what should l do ?
Baby..you say..

738
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:28,160
either enforcement, or revenue intelligent
or vigilance who ever may be

739
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:31,667
we get Eappachan's house raided
on the eve of auction.

740
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:39,597
All amount collected for auction must be seized
bank accounts must be freezed

741
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:43,610
if possible we get Eappan himself under custody.
How ...is it possible ?

742
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,319
Kunjuchan, ls there Comrade Balakrishnan ?

743
00:59:58,728 --> 00:59:59,592
Minister is in a discussion..

744
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:02,261
Not Minister...Comrade Black Flag Balakrishan

745
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:04,497
Eappacha..please stop.
please excuse..

746
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:07,696
l can't let you in now,
please you should go back

747
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:12,006
Mr.Local committee, you may be remembering
that time you were party messenger

748
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:16,367
when comrade Balakrishan is in refuge
in Aanakattil house

749
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:26,288
then Eappachan has stopped like this
all those including lG who came to arrest him,

750
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:33,393
Are your hands strong enough now
to stop me ? -Eappacha..

751
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:35,524
Baby, Let us think of it once again?

752
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:39,993
if we think a lot we will also
come back to cochin-Malabar belt.

753
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,764
Will your son and in laws suffer the loss ?

754
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,640

when you come here with out any
government programmes

759
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:14,499
you will exhibit your butter like corpus
only among these fellows...l know it.

760
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:18,303
To guess that there's no need of
learning communist manifesto, or Das capital

761
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:20,433
lts enough to have the
commonsense of an arrack shop owner

762
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,174
who the hell brought you here ?

763
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:25,139
My old toddy tapper, your
deceased father Gopalan.

764
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:26,176
You dog.

769
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:42,055
Eappan had always forgiven ,all that
you had done against me

770
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:45,600
But still there's cheat in all your minds.

771

l will give you 3 days more to get me
back all that you have deceived from me

772
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:59,842
Otherwise, there no men will be left
in Kunnel and Kadayadi to stand like this.

ls this your Jeep.
lt seems to be something wrong

859
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:52,314

861
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:24,978
Our Lady..

862
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:31,184
l considered you as male
among Kadayadi family

863
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:37,985
not as a coward one who
stab from the back but as a male.

864
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:43,424
right...you go
go and escape.

865
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:09,824
Kochu Theresa...

866
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:12,955
who betrayed you ?

867
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,399
you shouldn't know
shouldn't know

868
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:23,695
Chackochi shouldn't
have the fate of my father.

869
01:12:55,037 --> 01:13:12,911
in the candles which melt and in the eyes
which stumbles with grief in the dark

870
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:26,899
won't it provide heart consolatory song sweetly
the comfortable consolatory song.

871
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:36,343
in the candles which melt

872
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:08,503
far away in the path of sky
in the soft Night

873
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:17,474
rain clouds were vanished , Oh amaible star

874
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:30,830
ls there lullaby to sleep well forgeting everything.
ls there any exhausted tune existing ?

875
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:40,734
in the candles which melt

876
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:08,298
when voyages in a boat
which does'nt know the river

877
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:17,442
oar of my silent dream was broken

878
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:30,917
Are there any shores far away ?
is there any shelter home....

879
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:49,635
in the candles which melt and in the eyes
which shatters with grief in the dark

880
01:15:50,479 --> 01:16:04,416
won't it provide heart consoling song sweetly
the comfortable consoling song.

881
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,636

01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:46,024
She is really a nuisance Madam,

901
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:49,262
You old lady...we should get these
nuisances arrested by police

902
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:49,930
stop it.

903
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,825

01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:52,126
Madam, while you read the whloe documents

They applied only after a week of the
last date we fixed for application.

912
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:03,599
don't say so, we were in the hospital as my
little son was hospitalised ...that's why...

913
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:09,869
Don't say your excuses here. Government
offices have its own time and rules.

914
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:16,412
Do each one this office obey all rules
of the government accurately

919
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:36,034

it was given to me with a
warning not to smoke much

949
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:12,258

much now if he had here now

for your breath taking performance,

951
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:19,591
He was so lenian towards set up right

952
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:24,994
he had asked about you
on the day before he died

953
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:29,440
and said your complexion is of 'Palappam'
poor.....mother...

961
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:49,290
Everything should be learned
from the begining.

962
01:22:52,901 --> 01:23:00,467
There stands a vaccum when father left
suddenly from all the chief positions

963
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,137
The breath startling vaccum.

964
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:12,687

978
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:56,386
Hussian,

979
01:23:56,931 --> 01:24:02,801
ask that Manager to bring me stock up-dates,
and whole statements from retail and wholesale--

980
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:03,199
Yes

981
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:18,280
as if my lchayan gets transformed
into a liquour barrel while l watch

982
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:21,288
l am really afarid...lchaya.

983
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:23,087
l am scared.

984
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,523
While sending the son to army
with all his blessings

985
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:36,805
Father had a strong resolution to himself while he
kept me away by sending to plantation,

986
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,204
when returned

987
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:43,675
that this Chakochi should
never be a liquour trader

988
01:24:46,314 --> 01:24:53,550
But many of his calculattion when he was alive
went wrong with the advent of death

989
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:09,167
can't you leave everything
at least this liquor line..

990
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:13,105
one day l asked this same question..Gouri.

991
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:18,675
His eyes were filled with tears when he
convinced me his philosophy that day.

992
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:23,843
there are hundreds of employees who lived

993
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:27,649
for Eappachyan in the bars and other liquour
outlets.

994
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:34,751
then their families who stood with him in his misery
their welfare..benefits

995
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:41,800
you know ,company directly provides umbrella,bag,
books,slate

996
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:46,033
every thing to their school going children

997
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:51,136
the hospital founded by father for
free medical aid and other charities...

998
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:56,045
He felt as if his family members were expelled

999
01:25:56,217 --> 01:25:59,880
when some one asked him to close all these
charities.

1000
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:05,591
Now l too can recognize the same pain
while l stand on behalf of him.

1001
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:11,889
lt's...lt's too deep Gouri,
Hey come on...

1002
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:16,033
lchaya....no.

1003
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:28,873
come here whenever you get time,
it's really a comfort for me

1004
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,408
l will come mother,

1005
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:36,252
Let me go.
Ok, lchaya..

1006
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,284
convey our greetings to Subadhra
ok

1007
01:26:52,073 --> 01:26:52,664
Greetings.

1008
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:54,565
come

1009
01:26:58,646 --> 01:27:01,308
hello, R.D.O madam is back after visit
yes...

1010
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:05,145
lt was told me ... l couldn't speak anything
that day, condolence

1011
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:05,882
come

1012
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:24,703
l came to confirm this matter once again.

1013
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:34,777
That...for example..are there any one
like company staff,friends, relatives to doubt ?

1014
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:36,014
At least a small doubt ?

1015
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:38,551
ls there any Pappichaya ?
That....

1016
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,851
Pappichayan knows more about
father's all activities.

1017
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,090
That...there are enemies ..all around
but

1018
01:27:48,329 --> 01:27:51,093
No, Sir, no one can be specially indicated.

1019
01:27:58,506 --> 01:27:59,336
who is this ?

1020
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:01,602
oh poor...he works here in the kitchen...

1021
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:05,179
No..No..he is a trusted person to
my father for 40 years Mr.Kaimal

1022
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:10,240
Then motive should be what we doubt
any earlier revenge.

1023
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:14,281
l see some co-insidances in my mind captain.

1024
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:18,183
perhaps without much delay
the real culprit will be caught.

1025
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:18,925
That means....

1026
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,394
lt is'nt proper to reveal that now

1027
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:28,129
lf you know the person, perhaps you
may get him killed before we arrest him

1028
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,397
you too are obstinate like Eappan.

1029
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:33,496
Let me see...l have arranged a trap.

01:28:57,665 --> 01:29:00,065
A.C is on full still persperate, isn't it ?

01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:05,365

1032
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,306
what ?

1033
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:12,072
check her birth certificate wheter
she has completed the age of 18

1034
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:16,211
or there will be case for rape...isn't it ?

1035
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:25,251

what happened ?

1038
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:37,401
lf anybody raids our godown
our situation will be worse

1039
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:41,807
Pappichan hasn't heard of our planing

1040
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:45,406
Pappichan,

of them,did't you hear his statement yesterday.

1042
01:29:54,088 --> 01:29:54,554
Yes

1043
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:59,918
we are going to play a new game with that
l told you about trap....trap.

1044
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:01,425
what do you mean by trap..?

1045
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:09,299
A neat game to ensure that even a
dog should not enter here for investgation.

1046
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,297
That means a rental accused.

1047
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:15,473
You know the person...vasavan
bootlegger Keeri vasavan

1048
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,472

01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:41,666
Move to that side.

1055
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:46,629
don't fold your lunki
l asked to keep your lunki properly

1056
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:48,969
Did DYSP sir tell you everything ?

1057
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:50,334
yes.

1058
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:54,809
How comfortably world moves
and how beautiful it is....

1059
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:00,484
Don't you know Pappichan ?

1060
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:01,945
yes

1061
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:07,489
This scoundral put fire to my house
and got me tortured

1062
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:10,620
with exicise last month for selling some illicit liquour.

1063
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:14,101
Finally l had to eat six mangooses to stand like this.

1064
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:16,899
we released you on bail and
left case to be abandoned

1065
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:19,629
when Eappachayan knew that
you got me in jail

1066
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:24,370
he send a lawyer and got me out
he gave me some money too.

1067
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:25,679
Are you thankful to Eappachyan for that ?

1068
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:31,880
l am not thankful to even my mother
who gave me birth.

1069
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:37,319
enough.. you aren't thankful you were revengeful
for geting you in jail and puting fire on home.

1070
01:31:37,592 --> 01:31:39,787
Not to him but to Eappachn who died

1071
01:31:40,428 --> 01:31:43,329
what for we keep hatred against the dead ?

1072
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:45,789
Before death, while he was alive.

1073
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:47,192
Oh that's how.

1074
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:51,428
do you remember.....pre vengance

1075
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:54,398
You also should have remembrance
this is under section 302

1076
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:57,243
you should get me the agreed
amount and acquittal from the case.

1077
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:58,977
otherwise when l enter in the witness box....

1078
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:02,839
stop it,you will be given your money
when you come out on bail

1079
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:04,811
l will get it from you if you don't give it.

1080
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:05,417
you will get it...?

1081
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,951

01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:10,254
l will kick you

1083
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:13,819
come here.

1084
01:32:15,296 --> 01:32:18,823
lf you want people to belive that you
arrested him after a big fight

1085
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:23,000
there should be some sign of it isn't it ?

1086
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:27,296
You may do whatever you like but
money should be given for that too.

1087
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,031
l will give it

1088
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:51,625
Baby...enough...if you beat
him again he will die.

1089
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:55,600
you should control your bloody tongue
when you appear before the court.

1090
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:57,766
yes, agreed.

1091
01:32:57,939 --> 01:33:00,134
take him, rest will be dealt by the lawyer.

1092
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:01,070
walk fast

1093
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:08,037
what are you looking ?
My lighter.

1094
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,448
lighter....you scoundral...walk...

1095
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:13,717
what if this rascal turn hostile later ?

1096
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:21,890
He is accused in 9 cases, if necessary
we will get him burried when he gets bail

1097
01:33:22,496 --> 01:33:25,932
Then we will put the case on Chakochi....

1098
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:28,131
That's it.

1099
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:45,577
when lchayan got him beaten and set fire
to his home l warned him not do so...pity.

1100
01:33:45,753 --> 01:33:48,745
who cares ? finally ....Pity.

1101
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:51,885
can't you belive what you read ?

1102
01:33:53,995 --> 01:33:55,792
what are you thinking Chakochi ?

1103
01:33:56,397 --> 01:33:57,830
ls there anybody behind it ?

1104
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:02,162
not yours,but his

1105
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,748
As the stand of prosecution is feeble
aganist giving bail to the accused

1106
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:22,550
and also it isn't convinced that the accused on bail
would influence the progress of the case adversely

1107
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:27,553
This court grants bail to the accused Kattuparmbil
Thevan Vassavan on the following conditions

1108
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:37,896
sir...

1109
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:41,099
Do you remember what l said ?

1110
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,574
what ?

1111
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:46,245
You rascal.., don't get yourself trapped.

1112
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:47,544
Be careful...

1113
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:49,511
what about my money ?

1114
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:51,015
They are Baby's people

1115
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:54,315
Go with them

1116
01:34:54,622 --> 01:34:55,554
then what about you, sir?

1117
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:56,847

1119
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:01,291

1120
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:04,429
Give it sir, l just asked only for a smoke.

1121
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:28,613

1126
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:38,336
Hello.

1127
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,130
what the hell do you...
you search once more

1128
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:42,339
Who is that ?

1129
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:45,975
DYSP, the police who went for search
returned without any information.

1130
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:50,076
Give it to me, l have something to say

What is the situation ?

1133
01:40:03,664 --> 01:40:06,861
we have searched every where
following their route, nothing was found.

1134
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:09,802
lf we got him...we would have...
got him...?

1135
01:40:11,538 --> 01:40:14,439
don't stay here...go and search everywhere

1136
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:16,542
Enough of searching...brother

1137
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:18,910
Vasavan has come.

1138
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:22,808
Where are those dogs ?

1139
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:50,171
Do you know me ?

1140
01:40:51,078 --> 01:40:52,238
Aanakattil Chakochi...

1141
01:40:55,282 --> 01:40:58,274
Abkari Lord Kadayadi Ragavan
the Male among males...

1142
01:41:01,488 --> 01:41:04,116
up-coming terror...Kadayadi Thambi

1143
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:08,821
The creul cold blooded Kunnel OuthaKutty.

1144
01:41:11,765 --> 01:41:15,223
the ageing but fearless boost tycoon
Kunnel Mattachan

1145
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:19,234
then the catastrophic don among liquour traders.

1146
01:41:20,307 --> 01:41:24,971
the most dredged self style war lord
Kadayadi Baby.

1147
01:41:28,982 --> 01:41:35,251
there are too strong persons here
but this rascal to load the burden.

1148
01:41:37,724 --> 01:41:38,816
Chacokhi we shall have a compromise.

1149
01:41:40,227 --> 01:41:45,597
get away with your compromise you rogue,
who support them at the cost of Government.

1150
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:49,826
be careful when you talk, l am the MLA of
the region and remember this is a private place

1151
01:41:51,472 --> 01:41:52,564

1152
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:54,506

All of you need not afraid much

1156
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:45,420
its only told that he didn't kill.

1157
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:51,857
he didn't say which bastard among you
stabbed my father from behind

1158
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:58,127
Beware this gun will be back to Baby then your
double heart won't enough to meet it

1159
01:42:58,639 --> 01:42:59,128
No,

1160
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,870
Chakochi hasjust started to read
the accounts between us

1161
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:05,273
there are still a lot to calculate

1162
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:10,179
till then bind the eyes of law and police
with the help of this rogue.

1163
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:15,886
Chakochi isn't going to come to any court
to give evidence,statement or any case

1164
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:18,285
and game for another game.

1165
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:23,289
whoever may be the persons who played
with the blood with Aanakattil Eappachan

1166
01:43:24,097 --> 01:43:28,727
Chakochi directly will be delivering the judgement
by conducting the examination and evidence

1167
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:29,760
don't try to threaten..

1168
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:31,896
your father too had done so much directly.

1169
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:41,610
You bloody Kadayadi...your time is going
to come only, then chakochi will come

1170
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:47,013
Remember this is an interval
and this isjust an intervention

1171
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:07,805
Our Lady save me..

1172

Elder sister

1176
01:44:18,585 --> 01:44:21,053
you were here, where are all others.

1177
01:44:22,489 --> 01:44:27,017
There was a feeling that there is a superior
when Eappachyan was there.

1178
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:29,789
Now there lies 600 acres without
proper supervision and care

1179
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:33,490
it all goes well only because l am here

Do you have remembrance ? you are
the one who came with empty hands

My son,didn't you hear...He asks
Paappichayan to get out.

1190
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:19,676
He....that dog..who takes waste plates.

01:45:20,781 --> 01:45:22,942

1192
01:45:25,352 --> 01:45:26,148

Although l accompined him l don't

But that day Eappachyan came out

1318
01:53:46,953 --> 01:53:48,944
why didn't you inform us this earlier ?

1319
01:53:49,522 --> 01:53:52,082

01:55:04,631 --> 01:55:06,098
some how this is his line too.

1338
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:08,765
No need of such force..?
But he is very neat. leave breath.

Chakochi, not on your
petty bourgeoise temptation but

1345
01:55:51,044 --> 01:55:57,381
comrade Eappachan has always helped me

1346
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:03,489
l have the remembrances of it , that's why
l came here when you asked for me.

1347
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:08,587
you didn't say except that father
came there to see Minister Balakrishan

1348
01:56:08,728 --> 01:56:11,162
what happened inside comrade Kunjuchan ?

1349
01:56:11,698 --> 01:56:19,867
l was standing outside. But l can
definitly say from what l could hear

1350
01:56:20,873 --> 01:56:26,971
one, there was a conspiracy aganist Eappachan
under the leadership of Minister Balakrishan

1351
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:34,386
two,Kadayadi's still have some
financial liabilities towards Eappachan

1352
01:56:36,422 --> 01:56:43,419
Eappachan slapped Ragavan and gave
a final warning to them before he left

1353
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:48,292
l need a little help

1354

01:57:23,302 --> 01:57:29,298
Chakochi,once Engels has said

1358
01:57:29,909 --> 01:57:33,675

to get him drank water.

01:58:02,408 --> 01:58:05,571
Not from in Kunnel and Kadayadi

Champakuzhi Jose.

02:02:46,759 --> 02:02:52,322
He seems to fear something, When l simply
asked what is his connection with Jose,

1435
02:02:53,999 --> 02:02:55,489
see his facial expressions.

denies to say even if we kill him

and the raid was made fruitless
because of the R.D.O's action

1559
02:13:36,208 --> 02:13:39,268
Then l will publish in the newspaper
R.D.O's intervention to save her lover.

yes sir.

1586
02:16:07,192 --> 02:16:13,358
Didn't you know that days of
feudalism and Jenmis are gone ?

02:16:13,698 --> 02:16:16,292
Sir,lf you had revealed for what l am called ?

1588
02:16:16,468 --> 02:16:18,561
Don't be in hurry...l am coming to it.

1589
02:16:19,137 --> 02:16:25,838
reports of concerned police officers about the spirit
raid have not come yet,but l know its details

1590
02:16:26,811 --> 02:16:29,371
you were the topic in the
small talk after the cabinet.

1591
02:16:30,015 --> 02:16:31,846
ls it correct what l hear ?

1592
02:16:33,218 --> 02:16:34,207
Have you no answer ?

1593
02:16:34,819 --> 02:16:37,185
you didn't say so far what you heard

1594
02:16:38,023 --> 02:16:41,982
so princess is reluctant to understand
things which directly explained.

1595
02:16:42,861 --> 02:16:46,194
speak it out sir,without beating
around the bush, l will under stand.

02:16:46,464 --> 02:16:50,491
stop it; now look ,its a warning
for you listen carefully

1597
02:16:51,069 --> 02:16:56,473

02:16:56,741 --> 02:16:58,606

Captain Jacob Stephen, Chakochi.

1602
02:17:08,853 --> 02:17:11,481
captain...liquour trader...rogue.

1603
02:17:11,890 --> 02:17:14,085

1604
02:17:14,359 --> 02:17:15,519
shut up. now listen

1605
02:17:16,027 --> 02:17:21,431
Your official desigination is not to
help such rascal do you understand ?

1606
02:17:22,367 --> 02:17:25,700
lf l come to know again that there is any
relationship between you and that rascal

1607
02:17:26,037 --> 02:17:32,601
l will take away your R.D.O crown,that day..

1608
02:17:33,511 --> 02:17:34,136

1609
02:17:35,347 --> 02:17:36,177
what do you want ?

1610
02:17:36,514 --> 02:17:38,311
please hear what l have to say

1611
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:39,682
l asked you to get lost.

1612
02:17:39,918 --> 02:17:40,680
stop it,sir.

1613
02:17:42,187 --> 02:17:43,279
and please listen.

1614
02:17:44,089 --> 02:17:48,150
But you may not understand
even if you hear

1615
02:17:50,929 --> 02:17:57,801
the time,when l had no money to pay college fee
not even a garment to change the wearing one.

1616
02:17:59,104 --> 02:18:04,974
Under a roof which was decayd
by poverty and pride

1617
02:18:05,777 --> 02:18:10,737
the time l decided to suicide
with my father and sister.

1618
02:18:12,684 --> 02:18:14,515
there was a life like that..

1619
02:18:15,553 --> 02:18:16,713
for this old feudalist ..sir

1620
02:18:16,955 --> 02:18:17,580
so what ?

1621
02:18:17,989 --> 02:18:23,950
you told about the bootlegger who died
on the road...that great man's son

1622
02:18:24,496 --> 02:18:27,488
a rascal in your language.

1623
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:31,225
He is like God for me sir.

1624
02:18:32,704 --> 02:18:41,339
yes sir, God, who raised me from all
difficulties to the present situation

1625
02:18:42,347 --> 02:18:44,645
That's chakochi for me sir.

1626
02:18:46,851 --> 02:18:57,227
But even if l try to help him with my official
desigination as you did now, he will not accept it sir

1627
02:18:58,363 --> 02:19:01,355
He stands very high that even
beyond your imagination

1628
02:19:01,666 --> 02:19:02,655
l told you to stop and get out.

1629
02:19:03,201 --> 02:19:05,499
No sir..You should hear this too.

1630
02:19:06,571 --> 02:19:10,268
You boasted to take away my desigination

1631
02:19:10,975 --> 02:19:14,103
But for that liquour trader you said,

1632
02:19:14,546 --> 02:19:21,008
however big the crown this Gouri
Parvathi will throw it to waste basket

1633
02:19:21,586 --> 02:19:25,852
So, don't attempt to thereaten like that

1634
02:19:26,458 --> 02:19:35,332
This Old feudal lord's daughter won't get afraid
if a cheap politicain like you gets angry.

1635
02:19:36,501 --> 02:19:40,267
Now please bear it in your mind.
and thank you for the patient hearing.

1636
02:19:50,081 --> 02:19:52,276
sir, what will do now ?
You go inside.

1637
02:19:52,517 --> 02:19:52,812
sir

1638
02:19:57,922 --> 02:20:02,120
Finally,the balance is loss of spirit
which we got through that scoundral

1639
02:20:03,528 --> 02:20:03,892
Ragava..

1640
02:20:04,396 --> 02:20:08,560
l addressed him...his name..Chapakuzhi Jose
as scoundral, not you.

1641
02:20:10,335 --> 02:20:17,400
Who knows what to come ?
Oh Our Lady you got us in a dilemma.

1642
02:20:17,842 --> 02:20:18,331
stop it.

1643
02:20:18,777 --> 02:20:25,615
Now l am worried that besides her
firing Minister may be handled by him.

1644
02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:26,882
Stop it.

1645
02:20:27,585 --> 02:20:31,749
No,Baby...he is correct although
he is a useless talktive

1646
02:20:32,424 --> 02:20:34,324
You should understand that
l lost my pride.

1647
02:20:34,793 --> 02:20:38,524
Minister,for the time being, let us get some
college students and throw stons at her car,

1648
02:20:39,164 --> 02:20:40,324
lts not possible now.

1649
02:20:40,432 --> 02:20:46,029
There are 156 groups in partynow from
local level onwards. Nobody will obey now.

1650
02:20:46,504 --> 02:20:48,665
Comrade, then let us punish her with transfer

1651
02:20:49,307 --> 02:20:51,571
For that,Revenue Minister belongs to another party,

1652
02:20:51,776 --> 02:20:54,768
he is pious christain,he won't agree it.

1653
02:20:55,346 --> 02:20:56,335
Hear it, l said a truth.

1654
02:20:59,784 --> 02:21:02,412
Hello..yes Ragavan..

1655
02:21:04,022 --> 02:21:05,353

when she returns ?

1657
02:21:13,431 --> 02:21:16,559
Your party worker from R.D.O office
Union leader K.P.Prhaladhan.

1658
02:21:16,701 --> 02:21:17,167
what did he say ?

1659
02:21:17,569 --> 02:21:21,335
that..till 9.30 pm discussion
about eviction in Marotichal

1660
02:21:21,773 --> 02:21:24,708
after that a prize distribution in
a meeting of Grama Panchayath

1661
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:30,707
However it is... it will be 11 or 12 pm
when R.D.O madam returns after all these.

1662
02:21:31,082 --> 02:21:33,710
then it will be correct timing
for prize distribution.

1663
02:21:33,952 --> 02:21:34,316
Yes

1664
02:21:34,786 --> 02:21:35,912
How..Baby will it work ?

1665
02:21:36,387 --> 02:21:39,288
This time Baby will directly do it..lsn't it ?

1666
02:21:40,191 --> 02:21:40,782

1667
02:21:41,593 --> 02:21:42,651

please shed a drop of blood from
anywhere else of her

1669
02:21:45,964 --> 02:21:48,125
body its not necssary it should be from the nose.

1670
02:21:48,633 --> 02:21:51,363
lts my prayer...please.

1671
02:21:51,603 --> 02:21:52,228

Oh, is this our R.D.O Madam ?

02:23:49,821 --> 02:23:52,585
what happened Madam ?
who did this ?

1681
02:23:53,291 --> 02:23:56,055
Madam is in bad terms with every one.

1682
02:23:56,561 --> 02:23:58,188
when she was in Kozikode fight was with collector,

1683

Our Minister, Comrade Balakrishan..he is
innocent but sometime behaves like this

1688
02:24:15,013 --> 02:24:17,504
Haven't you heard that an
innocent may be effected as wicked.

1689
02:24:19,183 --> 02:24:20,616

what did he say my girl ?

1729

Your dear son..chakochi.

1730
02:26:47,398 --> 02:26:51,061
lf we take birth that should be in
America, at least in the next life

1731
02:26:51,669 --> 02:26:58,438
when l and CM arrived at Washington what a
beautiful climate,facilities ...very luxurious.

1732
02:27:00,778 --> 02:27:01,301
what do you want ?

1733
02:27:01,479 --> 02:27:05,176
He is one of our toddy tappers,
who fell from cocanut tree.

1734
02:27:05,917 --> 02:27:07,384
if he is allowed any favour from Government....

1735
02:27:07,652 --> 02:27:11,554
who asked you to climb on that
in this old age ?...go. keep it there.

1736
02:27:14,859 --> 02:27:15,587
One has come to see you.

1737
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:16,292
who is that ?

1738
02:27:16,727 --> 02:27:17,250
an abkari

1739
02:27:18,462 --> 02:27:19,053
ask to come.

1740
02:27:29,373 --> 02:27:29,771
who are you ?

1741
02:27:30,208 --> 02:27:31,937
l am the son of an
old bootlegger.

1742
02:27:33,344 --> 02:27:38,179
you may be remembering the one who
was stabbed by someone in the street.

1743
02:27:39,750 --> 02:27:40,239
Chakochi

1744
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:46,948
There was a clash between you
and father before the day he died.

1745
02:27:47,592 --> 02:27:49,457
l mean you had met him.. at Kadayadis...

1746
02:27:50,094 --> 02:27:54,030
Oh..yes..He is Eappachan's son our
Aanakatil Eappachan, comrade

1747
02:27:54,498 --> 02:27:56,159
Oh our Toddy shop contractor.

1748
02:27:57,468 --> 02:27:59,595
He was killed in the road,isn't it ?

1749
02:28:00,938 --> 02:28:01,563
who killed him ?

1750
02:28:02,139 --> 02:28:02,571
who is this guy ?

1751
02:28:02,940 --> 02:28:04,805
Don't you know Ex.MLA Kumaran ?

1752
02:28:05,676 --> 02:28:12,582
our retaking paddy field strike.l saw your photo in
news paper with plucked cocanut tree.Excellent.

1753
02:28:13,618 --> 02:28:14,380
why there is a scornful modulation ?

1754
02:28:15,319 --> 02:28:18,755
l have respect for you Comrade
what a heavy class analysis.

1755
02:28:20,091 --> 02:28:23,618
lf a farmer who became bankrupt
of rice, plants a cocunut in his field

1756
02:28:23,861 --> 02:28:27,388
he becomes bourgeiose,land lord,
orthodoxic..isn't it comrade ?

1757
02:28:27,665 --> 02:28:28,962
Kick out this Bourgeise.

1758
02:28:29,333 --> 02:28:29,697
get lost you...

1759
02:28:30,001 --> 02:28:30,729
Jayachandran, no.

1760
02:28:31,135 --> 02:28:34,662
lf we let him go unhurt its a shame
for the party.you get out

1761
02:28:36,941 --> 02:28:43,608
don't take advantage of these poor
who starve to give you food

1762
02:28:44,115 --> 02:28:46,982
lf you want to beat come directly
come alone to beat..is it possible ?

1763
02:28:47,251 --> 02:28:48,013
You...l will..

1764
02:28:48,419 --> 02:28:49,443
move away.

1765
02:28:50,021 --> 02:28:50,953
who are you to insult him ?

1766
02:28:51,188 --> 02:28:52,416
comrade...
He is my gust.

1767
02:28:53,691 --> 02:28:54,658
All of you get out.

1768
02:28:56,327 --> 02:28:59,353
come Chakochi come let us
sit inside and discuss

1769
02:28:59,997 --> 02:29:02,192
come let us
sit inside and discuss

1770
02:29:07,305 --> 02:29:09,364
l read your article in Manorama.

1771
02:29:10,741 --> 02:29:12,606
Aanakattil Eappachan's house roof.

1772
02:29:13,678 --> 02:29:17,273
taste of dried fish and rice
served by my mother

1773
02:29:17,782 --> 02:29:18,680
Memories of your hiding

1774
02:29:19,350 --> 02:29:20,578
stop it. what did you think ?

1775
02:29:21,519 --> 02:29:26,889
thought to insult me in my office
infront of my party members

1776
02:29:27,425 --> 02:29:28,289
Bloody rascal

1777
02:29:29,293 --> 02:29:31,989
lf you think to fear me by
saying your deceased father

1778
02:29:32,463 --> 02:29:37,264
if you come here again for it
you will get decayed in the coffine.

1779
02:29:37,835 --> 02:29:39,700
like your father is
getting decayed now.

1780
02:29:42,173 --> 02:29:45,370
l stop here all that we had
between us till yesterday.

1781
02:29:45,743 --> 02:29:48,610
even including that you did
to my girl. The entire account.

1782
02:29:50,381 --> 02:29:51,541
Your greediness,

1783
02:29:51,716 --> 02:29:58,178
that make you to lick the palm you put not only in
jaggary pot but also in septic tank.

1784
02:29:58,856 --> 02:30:04,385
and if you again join with Kadayadis
chakochi will tear out publicly

1785
02:30:05,229 --> 02:30:09,632
your pseudo socialistic,pseudo prolitarian
,pseudo philanthropic bamboosil

1786
02:30:09,967 --> 02:30:11,662
your mask of a pseudo communist.

1787
02:30:12,370 --> 02:30:15,567
l will tear it out and l
will spit upon your face.

1788
02:30:16,007 --> 02:30:17,065
lf needed on your dead body's face.

1789
02:30:18,042 --> 02:30:19,669
Remember...remember always.

1790
02:30:28,519 --> 02:30:30,384
How is it Chakochi ?
Did you make him to drink water ?

1791
02:30:30,654 --> 02:30:31,985
full, stomach full.

1792
02:30:32,289 --> 02:30:34,849
lchaya...l will get..
Hey no.

1793
02:30:35,226 --> 02:30:35,783
come on let's go.

1794
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:37,127
right comrade,
see you later.

1795
02:30:37,395 --> 02:30:39,625
Lal salam.
Lal Salam.

1796
02:30:47,004 --> 02:30:50,599
Here is the amount we
have to pay..1 .5 crores.

1797
02:30:52,309 --> 02:30:54,607
last time Eappachyan...
l know..

1798
02:30:55,379 --> 02:30:58,610
arears as Kollem,and Pathanamthitta
were given to KK Group

1799
02:30:59,050 --> 02:31:00,108
l talked to the Advocate,

1800
02:31:00,251 --> 02:31:05,279
although there is no document except
verbatim we can move aganist them

1801
02:31:05,689 --> 02:31:06,383
no need.

1802
02:31:07,358 --> 02:31:14,821
However its an encumberance left by father
so, it's a debt left on us

1803
02:31:15,332 --> 02:31:19,701
father won't get peaceful rest in cemetary
if we don't pay it.

1804
02:31:21,639 --> 02:31:26,042
there will be enough funds in bank
before the auction.

1805
02:31:26,710 --> 02:31:29,508
you should get clearence after
paying the arrears by yourself.

1806
02:31:35,386 --> 02:31:39,049
so, have you decided to go for auction ?

1807
02:31:41,058 --> 02:31:47,395
l have never said an opinion in
such matters when father was alive.

1808
02:31:47,998 --> 02:31:50,967
why should you beat
around the bush mother?

1809
02:31:52,369 --> 02:31:54,030
By then there appear tears too.

1810
02:31:54,939 --> 02:31:56,099
what is the matter. come on say mother ?

1811
02:31:56,574 --> 02:32:04,242
Now we are afraid that you
too are involving in quarrels

1812
02:32:09,386 --> 02:32:11,183
So,Madam is behind the curtain

1813
02:32:13,858 --> 02:32:14,654
come..come..

1814
02:32:19,530 --> 02:32:23,626
so this is reason of your
hon'ble presence. isn't it ?

1815
02:32:24,835 --> 02:32:26,928
what girl..are you there behind this ?

1816
02:32:27,304 --> 02:32:28,430
what for this is again lchayan ?

1817
02:32:29,273 --> 02:32:35,234
father had earned much for us
can't we be satisfied with it ?

1818
02:32:36,680 --> 02:32:41,549
Let's stop..and let's also forget
what they had done to our father

1819
02:32:42,119 --> 02:32:44,417
lsn't it ? can you ?

1820
02:32:45,189 --> 02:32:45,678
lchaya...

1821
02:32:47,124 --> 02:32:49,558
then we will forget the cold
blooded murder he met. lsn't it ?

1822
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:50,426
Chakochi

1823
02:32:51,462 --> 02:32:55,091
l don't know, l don't know
to forget like that.

1824
02:32:56,767 --> 02:33:01,898
Chakochi too has a mind of Aanakkattil Eappachan,
who has nevr forgiven to the destroyers

1825
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:06,704
chakochi too posseses the same mind of grand
father whose hands never shook,

1826
02:33:06,777 --> 02:33:07,869
while cuting one's neck

1827
02:33:08,946 --> 02:33:09,708
don't try to stop me.

1828
02:33:11,081 --> 02:33:12,605
l don't want to amass wealth

1829
02:33:13,250 --> 02:33:13,978
l don't like it also.

1830
02:33:14,952 --> 02:33:17,614
but its my challenge
l will get the auction.

1831
02:33:18,255 --> 02:33:19,586
Chakochi wants to conquer it ?

1832
02:33:20,558 --> 02:33:24,688
only for this time. Then
Chakochi will leave everything.

1833
02:33:24,895 --> 02:33:25,486
lchaya..

1834
02:33:26,897 --> 02:33:35,635
No, don't be afraid,nothing is going to happen
to anyone. Your lchayan won't let it

1835
02:33:38,175 --> 02:33:39,767
My children.

1836
02:33:44,748 --> 02:33:47,581
lchayan, how can you leave
everything suddenly ?

1837
02:33:49,186 --> 02:33:55,887
Do you know in my father's last
days he had all these in his mind.

1838
02:33:56,694 --> 02:33:57,991
l only implement it

1839
02:34:00,264 --> 02:34:06,464
We form a company where all the labours of
father's liquour companies have equal share

1840
02:34:07,504 --> 02:34:09,369
A company fully under
the control of Labours.

1841
02:34:11,242 --> 02:34:18,045
Then after this year's auction we register all
institutions of Aanakattil under this new company

1842
02:34:18,983 --> 02:34:22,384
at the end of the year labours
can share the profit.

1843
02:34:23,220 --> 02:34:25,882
Both of them will be there
at the head of the company.

1844
02:34:29,126 --> 02:34:32,687
then as guide,well wisher,and chief strategist

1845
02:34:33,163 --> 02:34:38,829
you will be there to weave strategies as the head...
Sunny Cheriyan Karimbanadu.

1846
02:34:41,438 --> 02:34:42,063
what happened ?

1847
02:34:43,941 --> 02:34:51,507
lf you throw crores of ruppees earned
through many years to workers like this

1848
02:34:52,483 --> 02:34:58,319
These labours also worked to accumulate
the crores you said.

1849
02:34:59,089 --> 02:35:01,455
However, it's easy to say
and more easy to hear.

1850
02:35:04,495 --> 02:35:08,591
Hello, Yes l am starting.
l will come soon.

1851
02:35:10,434 --> 02:35:12,732
lt's MP lchaya...
Let me go then..See you tomorrow.

1852
02:35:13,103 --> 02:35:21,636
Right.You should be with me tomorrow
onwards untill the auction is over

1853
02:35:22,079 --> 02:35:23,944
Yes, lchaya..l am with you

1854
02:35:25,816 --> 02:35:26,441
Let me go then ?

1855
02:35:28,352 --> 02:35:29,250
why he is so ?

1856
02:35:31,255 --> 02:35:35,316
lf we convince him once again
he will stand firmly with us..lsn't it ?

1857
02:35:37,661 --> 02:35:38,559
comrade, please listen..

1858
02:35:39,596 --> 02:35:42,394
although he says to hand
over everything to labours,

1859
02:35:42,733 --> 02:35:43,893
it's an intelligent game of Chakochi.

1860
02:35:45,069 --> 02:35:47,196
his very tricky plan to
get you of this place,

1861
02:35:47,738 --> 02:35:49,171
Don't get him afraid

1862
02:35:50,207 --> 02:35:55,144
No,Mattachan, l am afraid after
that incident in the party office

1863
02:35:55,779 --> 02:36:02,150
Listen Ragavan, if fight is aganist labours
l can't be with you, though l am willing

1864
02:36:02,753 --> 02:36:04,687
Comrade,please Don't put
us in dilemma like this.

1865
02:36:05,089 --> 02:36:10,618
There are some still in party leadership
lovers of labours...honest fellows !

1866
02:36:11,061 --> 02:36:13,859
They will declare prize for my head
if they come to know of it.

1867
02:36:14,331 --> 02:36:15,764
you can see, my chair
will be taken away

1868
02:36:16,433 --> 02:36:20,301
comrade, who is going to know that
you joined in our partnership.

1869
02:36:20,971 --> 02:36:24,998
All these are leaked now, this too
will be like that, its my experience.

1870
02:36:25,175 --> 02:36:27,075
according to my horoscope
now l am having bad time.

1871
02:36:28,078 --> 02:36:30,137
l am telling my final decision

1872
02:36:30,681 --> 02:36:34,173
you should destroy him before the
auction or avoid him at any cost.

1873
02:36:34,785 --> 02:36:35,683
No one should know it.

1874
02:36:36,153 --> 02:36:38,485
lf no, l can'tjoin you
otherwise l am leaving

1875
02:36:38,889 --> 02:36:43,986
Comrade,don't rush to decision, Baby has
gone for good purpose. Let him come

1876
02:36:45,095 --> 02:36:48,223
There is good thing suited for piles
Shall l serve one.

1877
02:36:48,932 --> 02:36:49,455
Yes,serve.

1878
02:36:50,868 --> 02:36:52,699
Comrade, it's Baby's call
you sit let me attend it.

1879
02:36:54,671 --> 02:36:56,605
Hello,
Give it to me.

1880
02:36:57,708 --> 02:37:03,977
lt's me..will it work ? enough,
he is enough, Let us win

1881
02:37:06,717 --> 02:37:13,850
l never expected this, when Ragavan said
that you have gone for a good thing.

1882
02:37:15,025 --> 02:37:16,287
l also didn't expect

1883
02:37:16,794 --> 02:37:22,790
we never guessed even in our dream
that Karibanadan Sunny will be brought here

1884
02:37:23,267 --> 02:37:24,564
Did you guess ?
Oh..no.

1885
02:37:25,202 --> 02:37:27,170
why are you so melanholic
after seeing Sunny ?

1886
02:37:27,638 --> 02:37:30,869
No..No. We are in the same group
isn't it Sunny ?

1887
02:37:31,275 --> 02:37:39,410
whichever may be the group,there are dignified
persons too,wear this just as you greedy ones

1888
02:37:39,550 --> 02:37:40,278
ls'nt it Sunny ?

1889
02:37:40,984 --> 02:37:42,349
Sadasiva,you see

1890
02:37:43,554 --> 02:37:44,680
By the god's grace

1891
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:53,086
ln the next election sunny will be our MLA
with our support and of Bishop and church

1892
02:37:53,497 --> 02:37:54,521
instead of you

1893
02:37:54,798 --> 02:37:56,595
lsn't it Baby ?
Of course.

1894
02:38:00,838 --> 02:38:07,744
any how, Sunny's decision to join our
camp will shake Chakkochi's stand

1895
02:38:08,779 --> 02:38:12,442
Oh our Lady, it's your grace

1896
02:38:13,450 --> 02:38:15,247
Otherwise, one who walked
with him untill yesterday...

1897
02:38:15,886 --> 02:38:18,684
Not untill yesterday...
But till this morning...

1898
02:38:19,790 --> 02:38:24,352
Mattachan,to be frank,Chakochi
has helped me a lot at all times.

1899
02:38:24,828 --> 02:38:29,731
l haven't forgotten that.But
above all we are business men

1900
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:32,168
Further,l am a politician

1901
02:38:32,903 --> 02:38:38,933
Chakochi's new line which surrenders
profitable liquour trade to labours

1902
02:38:39,176 --> 02:38:42,077
This blockheaded line...
lt is dangerous.

1903
02:38:42,546 --> 02:38:44,514
Not for me alone but also for you

1904
02:38:44,882 --> 02:38:48,249
and those wish to gain money through
the liquour trade tomorrow..lsn't it ?

1905
02:38:48,886 --> 02:38:49,682
lt's true.

1906
02:38:50,954 --> 02:38:52,148
Did you read the papers properly ?

1907
02:38:52,723 --> 02:38:53,655
Everything Perfect.

1908
02:38:55,926 --> 02:38:57,359
Both of you come and sign

1909
02:39:01,231 --> 02:39:05,725
l told you, this time we are going to
have auction in your names.

1910
02:39:06,537 --> 02:39:07,367
then in Sunny's name too.

1911
02:39:09,873 --> 02:39:10,339
Here it is..

1912
02:39:11,408 --> 02:39:14,605
lchayan wants to keep away from
here after entrusting all this.

1913
02:39:14,912 --> 02:39:17,039
Keep away...
what does lchayan say ?

1914
02:39:17,447 --> 02:39:21,941
No,we should fix that proposal for Ammani
which came from Bharanaganam

1915
02:39:23,186 --> 02:39:25,381
Marriage shall be held after
father's death anniversery

1916
02:39:26,189 --> 02:39:29,920
then, mother and Kunjumol
they will come with me to estate.

1917
02:39:30,627 --> 02:39:31,924
then she too.

1918
02:39:33,330 --> 02:39:35,230
So you are going away from here.

1919
02:39:35,732 --> 02:39:39,293
not going away..l will be
partially here and there.

1920
02:39:40,270 --> 02:39:41,259
Then what about us ?

1921
02:39:44,374 --> 02:39:48,037
l told you..you will live here, in this house

1922
02:39:48,979 --> 02:39:54,178
after getting married live here happily
without quarrel with your children

1923
02:39:55,352 --> 02:39:56,580
come, come and sign.

1924
02:39:57,020 --> 02:39:57,543
No,lchaya

1925
02:39:58,822 --> 02:40:01,518
we have so far obeyed you

1926
02:40:02,192 --> 02:40:07,061
But,new company's affairs you
entrust Sunny.He will deal it.

1927
02:40:07,564 --> 02:40:07,962
lsn't it ?

1928
02:40:08,832 --> 02:40:11,130
He only has such higher ambitions.

1929
02:40:11,568 --> 02:40:12,296
what about you ?

1930
02:40:12,536 --> 02:40:14,333
we too come with you lsn't it ?

1931
02:40:20,811 --> 02:40:26,113
You are with me, as my shadow since my
childhood.

1932
02:40:27,184 --> 02:40:28,446
lt's not enough...
lchaya...

1933
02:40:29,286 --> 02:40:38,194
Not enough...you both should posses
at least something as your own

1934
02:40:39,196 --> 02:40:40,254
That's why lchayan...

1935
02:40:44,901 --> 02:40:45,560
why do you cry ?

1936
02:40:49,172 --> 02:40:51,333
Nothing..lchaya.
l just remembered ....

1937
02:40:54,144 --> 02:41:00,049
the first day l came to the refectory
with my mother.

1938
02:41:01,985 --> 02:41:05,113
You too came there with
your father to serve

1939
02:41:06,356 --> 02:41:06,947
He too was there..

1940
02:41:08,425 --> 02:41:14,557
although an orphan,he was
walking as if your brother

1941
02:41:15,298 --> 02:41:15,696
lsn't it ?

1942
02:41:17,234 --> 02:41:18,394
why do you say all these now ?

1943
02:41:19,770 --> 02:41:20,930
l amjust remembering, lchaya.

1944
02:41:22,606 --> 02:41:25,837
One day in the veranda of a shop
when l got up startled

1945
02:41:26,877 --> 02:41:30,813
My mother was crushing me
like this because of fix

1946
02:41:31,748 --> 02:41:33,773
l slept silently closing eyes hardly.

1947
02:41:35,285 --> 02:41:40,621
ln the morning l felt my mother's
frozen hands, stiff like this...

1948
02:41:44,561 --> 02:41:48,861
l was alone..when someone took
away the dead body of my mother.

1949
02:42:01,678 --> 02:42:03,475
l knew only one way that time,

1950
02:42:04,915 --> 02:42:10,251
the way to this big house where
sufficient food is served at any time

1951
02:42:12,089 --> 02:42:16,048
You came out of house on
hearing my cry from refectory.

1952
02:42:17,127 --> 02:42:19,288
You gave me your
toy asking not to cry.

1953
02:42:21,131 --> 02:42:25,033
since then l started to walk
as your shadow..but still

1954
02:42:27,037 --> 02:42:27,969
l know lchaya..

1955
02:42:28,872 --> 02:42:30,806
when you say that you withdraw
after entrusting us everything

1956
02:42:31,708 --> 02:42:36,168
You want to keep us away safely

1957
02:42:37,681 --> 02:42:38,943
Then you want to take revenge alone

1958
02:42:41,818 --> 02:42:46,050
You told Kadayadis that you will
punish them out of law and court.

1959
02:42:46,857 --> 02:42:49,189
You are preparing to do it alone,isn't it ?

1960
02:42:50,994 --> 02:42:55,658
we won't leave you alone to
take vengence for father.

1961
02:42:56,533 --> 02:42:59,798
we will be there untill the end.

1962
02:43:19,222 --> 02:43:19,916
lchaya..

1963
02:43:28,799 --> 02:43:29,788
give me a cigarette.

1964
02:43:50,787 --> 02:43:54,086
l didn't get Sunny over the phone
find him from somewhere else.

1965
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:58,252
Get all these signed by him

1966
02:44:01,698 --> 02:44:04,997
We have to decide many things
before we go to auction hall.

1967
02:44:05,902 --> 02:44:06,732
l will find him out lchaya.

1968
02:44:11,174 --> 02:44:11,469
go.

1969
02:44:13,877 --> 02:44:15,003
Hussain.
yes.

1970
02:44:19,349 --> 02:44:21,317
Otherwise.....no need
you come soon.

1971
02:44:21,685 --> 02:44:22,049
yes.

1972
02:44:31,695 --> 02:44:32,787
why do you cry ?

1973
02:44:34,097 --> 02:44:34,654
simply...

1974
02:44:39,069 --> 02:44:39,296
what happened ?

1975
02:44:39,870 --> 02:44:41,531
Oomma..n
Omman.

1976
02:44:42,038 --> 02:44:43,835
l will get you beaten.
go.

1977
02:44:45,976 --> 02:44:46,305
come.

1978
02:44:55,886 --> 02:44:59,322
finally both you and Oomman withdrew
on some sentiments.

1979
02:45:00,190 --> 02:45:01,987
Now the auction is in my name alone.

1980
02:45:03,627 --> 02:45:08,223
though,only for the sake of name the head of
the company is Sunny Cheriyan Karimbanadan

1981
02:45:09,232 --> 02:45:10,824
But the whole profit goes to labours.

1982
02:45:12,068 --> 02:45:13,831
Hussian,what makes
lchayan so mad like this ?

1983
02:45:14,771 --> 02:45:20,175
Once in your need he met Thevar without regarding
any consequences. This mad is, one like it.

1984
02:45:20,610 --> 02:45:21,076
sign it.

1985
02:45:22,245 --> 02:45:23,234
l wasjustjoking.

1986
02:45:30,253 --> 02:45:33,745
what are lchayan's secrete
movements to destroy them ?

1987
02:45:34,791 --> 02:45:36,088
You can ask him directly.

1988
02:45:37,494 --> 02:45:38,051
right ..right.

1989
02:45:40,363 --> 02:45:43,355
Give to you lchayan.
then what about you ?

1990
02:45:43,934 --> 02:45:48,132
l will come after one hour l have
group meeting in MP's house.

1991
02:45:48,471 --> 02:45:51,998
Sunny,we have to plan many things
he asked me to get you there.

1992
02:45:52,409 --> 02:45:53,535
l will tell to lchayan...you go.

1993
02:45:54,144 --> 02:45:56,339
sunny... l..
Go..lchayan will be waiting

1994
02:46:00,050 --> 02:46:02,644
lt is the first auction that comes
after Eappachayan's demise.

1995
02:46:03,320 --> 02:46:07,347
the great opportunity for Chakochi
to destroy you all.

1996
02:46:08,658 --> 02:46:12,458
lf you fail now, it's the end of you
as well as of me.

1997
02:46:13,463 --> 02:46:15,363
we too play knowing it.

1998
02:46:19,369 --> 02:46:24,136
say sunny, what is in Chakochi's mind
when he comes for auction tomorrow

1999
02:46:25,075 --> 02:46:28,670
To know it we should
ask chakochi himself

2000
02:46:29,079 --> 02:46:32,071
or to one,who knows his mind

2001
02:46:32,782 --> 02:46:34,409
To his Hussain, isn't it Sunny ?

2002
02:46:36,419 --> 02:46:40,583
There shouldn't be Hussian on the right side
of chakochi for tomorrow's auction.

2003
02:46:42,292 --> 02:46:50,131
l want to see Chakochi's bleeding face
when you twist in the last moment.

2004
02:46:52,135 --> 02:46:54,968
now where can we get your Hussain?
do you know?.

2005
02:46:55,839 --> 02:46:59,570
lf you ask exactly...Let's try.

2006
02:47:26,870 --> 02:47:28,064
Aslam Alekum
Va alekum uslam

2007
02:47:28,438 --> 02:47:30,406
why are you here unusally ?

2008
02:47:31,141 --> 02:47:40,880
As you know,Hussian needs to sit here when
l am very happy or very sad of thinking past

2009
02:47:41,751 --> 02:47:44,811
then only...
shall l go.

2010
02:47:51,061 --> 02:47:51,493
Hussian

2011
02:47:55,598 --> 02:47:56,292
lt's me Hussian

2012
02:48:00,970 --> 02:48:06,135
where were you ? lchayan was waiting for you the
whole day. you said to reach there after an hour.

2013
02:48:06,476 --> 02:48:07,943
Now lchayan send me as you are not seen

2014
02:48:08,378 --> 02:48:09,436
Why? is there any problem ?

2015
02:48:09,813 --> 02:48:11,371
yes..a little problem.

2016
02:48:28,064 --> 02:48:30,794
ls your last prayer over ?

2017
02:48:31,201 --> 02:48:31,633
Sunny you move away.

2018
02:48:38,475 --> 02:48:39,032
You escape.

2019
02:48:41,044 --> 02:48:42,204
Sunny l asked you escape.

2020
02:48:43,313 --> 02:48:44,575
Get into the vehicle.
Move you...

2021
02:48:52,422 --> 02:48:53,480
Sunny....You

2022
02:49:06,636 --> 02:49:07,660
l will kill you swine.

2023
02:49:16,346 --> 02:49:17,404
Leave me you swine .

2024
02:49:22,752 --> 02:49:23,844
pig.
come on, walk.

2025
02:49:31,294 --> 02:49:33,057
lchayan,here is solvency clearance

2026
02:49:34,063 --> 02:49:35,360
these are papers ,signed by Sunny.

2027
02:49:36,432 --> 02:49:38,161
This is bank draft and this is pass.

2028
02:49:39,135 --> 02:49:41,433
Now only you came to a real abkari line.

2029
02:49:42,872 --> 02:49:44,066

when you came before me crying
that she will commit suicide

2042
02:50:39,596 --> 02:50:42,588
This Chakochi acted for you ignoring
of all the consequences.

2061
02:53:21,324 --> 02:53:24,191
But,he won't reveal even
if we sting on his palate

2062
02:53:24,460 --> 02:53:28,055

l won't give even your body to chakochi.
