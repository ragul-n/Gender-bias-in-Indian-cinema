1
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:05,236
Wonder what happened today.
Maya suddenly felt like it.

2
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:15,669
*The shadow awoke*

3
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:58,432
*A naughty...*

4
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,490
*thought arose*

5
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:32,325
*Dressed from head to toe*

6
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:36,099
*To meet her dreams...*

7
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:40,474
*left Maya.

8
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:06,789
It’s simple.
The case is very simple.

9
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:11,633
- Appearances can be deceptive.
- What do you mean?

10
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:16,136
Mean? When you dig skeletons
out of the cupboard...

11
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:19,107
souls are freed
and trouble you for life.

12
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:23,177
- What nonsense are you talking!
- I cannot sleep.

13
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:25,079
I haven't slept since ages.

14
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,930
- You have grown old.
- I will retire after this case.

15
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:32,414
Mayagate has created
mayhem in this small town.

16
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:35,155
The rumours are wild but the
mystery is still in shrouds.

17
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:36,366
That's not true.

18
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:01,348
Let's begin.

19
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:22,296
Excuse me.

20
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:29,111
Excuse me. I want to
ask you a few questions.

21
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:33,426
We know you are
under mental stress.

22
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,876
But we have to do our duty.

23
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:38,727
We have to ask
questions in such cases.

24
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,484
We hope you will
co-operate with us.

25
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,268
And speak the truth.

26
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Your name?

27
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:54,829
Age?

28
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:57,832
40.

29
00:06:57,899 --> 00:06:58,899
Relationship?

30
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,140
Maya's husband.

31
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:11,332
When and in what circumstances
did you meet her the first time?

32
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:18,472
It was a stormy night.

33
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,476
It was a stormy night.

34
00:07:58,226 --> 00:07:59,956
- I’m Maya.
- I’m Das.

35
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:11,944
- I’m totally drenched.
- At least you came.

36
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:13,423
Maya, where are you?

37
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:14,975
Come.

38
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,722
First change your clothes.

39
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:22,917
Come.

40
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:35,229
I cannot bear it any more.

41
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,670
Now that he is here,
everything will be alright.

42
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:42,765
- Where do you have the pain?
- Not there.

43
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:44,338
- In this leg?
- Yes.

44
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,029
- Near the knee?
- Yes.

45
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:50,244
It's not serious,
just a simple dislocation.

46
00:08:50,245 --> 00:08:53,105
- But how did this happen?
- He slipped.

47
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:59,031
Strange weather.
Everyone seems to be slipping.

48
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:03,758
- Sometimes, for no reason...
- No, I didn't slip.

49
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,669
I got a bout of dizziness.

50
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:09,781
I felt everything going round &
round. I was in a tizzy.

51
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:16,339
Your blood pressure
must have risen.

52
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:20,962
Because it cannot be a heart
attack, or you would be dead.

53
00:09:21,276 --> 00:09:25,166
And if you had died,
you wouldn't have felt any pain.

54
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:28,491
I’ll check your blood pressure.

55
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:33,755
It must be blood pressure.
She raises my blood pressure.

56
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:40,031
- Since her mother died...
- Father! You started it again!

57
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,940
Even I am a father after all.

58
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:50,596
Your tension increases
four fold...

59
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:55,086
if your daughter is educated,
intelligent, and even beautiful.

60
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:59,154
Where do I find a groom
for such a girl?

61
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:04,397
Until she completes her
education,...

62
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,409
she crosses marriageable age.

63
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:10,562
She is intelligent, so
she develops a modern outlook.

64
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:14,436
And if she is also beautiful,
she even has dreams.

65
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:19,802
From where does one
bring a dream prince?

66
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:34,147
Anyone can get lost here.

67
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:40,424
I cannot believe this!

68
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:41,856
Is this you?

69
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:50,061
-Who knows? -This is a dangerous
illness which has no cure.

70
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,888
This 'who knows'.
A lot can happen in it.

71
00:10:56,938 --> 00:11:00,358
A lot happens and you
don't even come to know.

72
00:11:00,876 --> 00:11:03,666
And why does one get
this 'who knows'?

73
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,879
Who knows?

74
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:09,383
Who knows, it could be a sin
of the previous birth.

75
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:12,634
Who knows, it could be
a curse of some sage.

76
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:16,891
Who knows, it could be
a fiction of imagination.

77
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:20,162
Who knows, it could be
a childhood infliction.

78
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:23,245
Who knows, it could be
a ghost mystery.

79
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:25,900
Who knows, it could be
a hole in the sky.

80
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:28,511
Who knows, it could be
a raw nerve.

81
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:32,973
- Who knows... - It could be
some intention in the mind.

82
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:34,909
Who knows, it could be
bad lineage.

83
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,911
Who knows, it could be
hurt inflicted on the heart.

84
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:38,412
Who knows, it
could be bad destiny.

85
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:40,414
Who knows, it could be a
forefather who was a drunkard.

86
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,416
Who knows, it could be
God's mistake.

87
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,919
Who knows, it could be
a speck of dust in the eye.

88
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,921
Who knows, it could be
a manufacturing defect.

89
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:49,832
Who knows, it could be
a special effect.

90
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:51,992
Who knows, it could be
something eaten at night.

91
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:55,153
Or maybe lost something,
and found something.

92
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:59,021
Who knows, it could
all be Maya (illusion)!

93
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:03,966
What do you not know?
You know everything.

94
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:12,614
The sky has cleared,
and even the night has passed.

95
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:16,189
I should be leaving now.

96
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:37,128
I’ll come to look up
your father after three days.

97
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:40,802
Dear diary, do dream
princes' come on bicycles?

98
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:46,981
Who knows?

99
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:58,031
*To keep talking to yourself*

100
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:14,385
*To close your eyes and fill
your heart with beautiful nights*

101
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:20,414
*To keep talking...*

102
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:02,525
*To tell yourself you are going*

103
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,457
*And tell
yourself you have come*

104
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:21,814
*Even this happens
when you are alone*

105
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,434
*When lonely,
filling pictures...*

106
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,093
*with colours*

107
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:44,498
*To keep talking...*

108
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:44,366
- You? Today?
- You have magic in your voice!

109
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:50,952
Yes, I...I had actually
come to return these clothes.

110
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,512
- Your father...
- He's sleeping.

111
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,179
Come.

112
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:13,917
- You...
- You...

113
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,610
- The colour of your eyes
changes in daylight. - Really?

114
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:29,592
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes?

115
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:39,009
How do you manage to take care
of such a big mansion alone?

116
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:43,717
You don't have to manage ruins.
They get ruined on their own.

117
00:16:43,718 --> 00:16:45,338
Don't you feel lonely?

118
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:49,837
- I play with dreams.
- But how do you kill time?

119
00:17:12,747 --> 00:17:15,657
Then I kept going
there again and again.

120
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,360
So you had
fallen in love with her?

121
00:17:19,754 --> 00:17:20,754
No.

122
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:26,218
I couldn't have
even thought of it then.

123
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:33,837
Because I was married.

124
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:38,951
- Your wife didn't object?
- To what?

125
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:41,894
To your going there
again and again?

126
00:17:42,277 --> 00:17:45,017
No, she never interfered
with my work.

127
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,330
You mean to say she didn't
mind...

128
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,784
your visiting another
woman again and again...

129
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:53,787
It’s not that.
She was my wife after all.

130
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:54,788
Then?

131
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:59,141
She kept praying
for very long one day.

132
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:01,295
Then?

133
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:05,477
She suffered a heart attack
and died.

134
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:12,684
Then, what I could not
have dreamt of happened.

135
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:19,339
One day, Maya's father came home
and told me she is very sick.

136
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:25,768
- She has a sweet voice.
- Really?

137
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:29,121
She sings, dances,
and even cooks food.

138
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,945
She is the
mistress of this mansion.

139
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:35,434
She is delicate, but healthy.

140
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:37,331
Lie down.

141
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:41,414
Examine her thoroughly.

142
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:42,986
Don't feel shy.

143
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:46,359
Don't worry, it won't hurt.

144
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,881
Can you remove your bed sheet.

145
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:54,305
Can you take a deep breath?
...Then take a deep breath.

146
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,896
I think she has caught cold.

147
00:19:19,874 --> 00:19:23,254
The dream prince touched her
with a magic wand.

148
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:27,768
Maya bloomed! Maya blossomed!
Maya was lost! Maya was finished!

149
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:48,179
*The shadow of a lovely gaze
has fallen on my heart*

150
00:19:54,742 --> 00:19:57,772
*Is she magic, a passion,
or an illusion?*

151
00:19:58,913 --> 00:19:59,913
*She's Maya!*

152
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:13,556
*Under the feet sometime...*

153
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,490
*if you find a heart*

154
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:22,175
*Kiss it and lift it...*

155
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:25,549
*very carefully*

156
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:37,197
*So what if anyone says you
have picked it from the street*

157
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:58,972
- Maya, I want to tell
you something. - What?

158
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:00,723
- Not like that.
- Then?

159
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:04,275
I mean, I think I
should say what I want to.

160
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:07,481
Say it.

161
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:10,513
Since I have seen you...I...

162
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:15,819
don't you think...

163
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:23,414
I think I should say
what I want to say today.

164
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:29,191
- Is it something special today?
- No.

165
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:33,786
- But there is something.
- Yes.

166
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,012
I want to talk to you about it,
so naturally there is something.

167
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:40,013
What is it?

168
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:43,476
I think if I don't mind...

169
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,380
I mean, if you don't mind,
we should do something.

170
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:54,036
Maya, understand
what we should do.

171
00:21:57,532 --> 00:22:00,534
Maya, don't laugh,
I am speaking the truth.

172
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:02,055
Listen....listen to...

173
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:15,215
- What happened?
- Something went into my eye.

174
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:16,216
Let me see.

175
00:22:28,563 --> 00:22:30,564
These are tears of happiness.

176
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:33,125
Now all tears will be of
happiness.

177
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:35,268
Always...always...always.

178
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:51,623
Careful. Ties do break
like that sometimes.

179
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:23,245
So what?
Everything will be alright.

180
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:25,218
Maya has come!

181
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:33,011
That's all that
is left of her now.

182
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:14,687
Oh my God!
I’m very late!

183
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:36,167
Everything is alright.
Maya is not alone.

184
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:38,201
She is not restless.

185
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:40,903
He loves Maya, Maya loves him.

186
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:45,437
Then what is lacking?
Nothing at all.

187
00:25:49,263 --> 00:25:52,432
- Do you love me very much?
- Yes, I love you very much.

188
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:54,834
- More than anyone else?
- More than anyone else.

189
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:58,271
- More than anyone in the world?
- More than anyone in the world.

190
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,273
- Do you like me?
- Yes, I like you.

191
00:26:00,274 --> 00:26:03,984
- Do you like to see me?
- Yes, I like to see you.

192
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:07,847
- Do you think I am mad?
- No, I don't think you are mad.

193
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:11,117
- Do you think I am beautiful?
- Yes, I think you are beautiful.

194
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:13,853
- Do I bore you?
- No, you don't bore me.

195
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:17,284
- Do you like my eyes?
- Yes, I like your eyes.

196
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:18,691
- Very much?
- Yes.

197
00:26:20,294 --> 00:26:22,264
Which one do you like more?

198
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:25,298
Whichever I say,
the other will feel jealous.

199
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:28,959
- You'll have to tell me.
- I like both your eyes.

200
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,220
- Really?
- Honest.

201
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:33,306
- You like my lashes?
- I like your lashes.

202
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:36,309
- You like my fragrance?
- I like my fragrance.

203
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:39,860
- Do you like my taste?
- Yes, I like your taste.

204
00:26:40,414 --> 00:26:43,817
- Do you think I am lazy?
- No, I don't think you are lazy.

205
00:26:43,818 --> 00:26:46,886
- Do you like to touch me?
- I like it very much.

206
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:49,737
- You are making fun of me!
- It hurts!

207
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:51,674
You are making fun of me!

208
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:54,027
What are you doing!
I’m not making fun of you.

209
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:56,329
- Do you really love me?
- I really love you.

210
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,832
- Say you love me.
- Say you love me.

211
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,453
- I love you.
- Say it with feeling.

212
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:05,677
I love you.
I love you very very much.

213
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:08,441
Do you like to take me
in your arms?

214
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:11,845
I like to take you in my arms,
I like to kiss you...

215
00:27:11,846 --> 00:27:15,348
I like to coochie-coo...
I like to do everything.

216
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:18,518
- Will you never leave me?
- No, I will never leave you.

217
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:20,849
- Honest?
- Honest! Or I’ll die!

218
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:30,483
Do you really love me?

219
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:35,367
Did you have a
happy married life?

220
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,600
Yes...I mean,
as much as is possible.

221
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,035
We never fought.

222
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:46,438
We didn't have
any problems either.

223
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,481
Everything was fine.

224
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:51,623
Then what happened,
why did it happen?

225
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:57,198
I don't know.
But she slowly began to change.

226
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:01,874
She would do strange things.

227
00:28:03,397 --> 00:28:05,377
I could not understand them.

228
00:29:44,498 --> 00:29:47,058
Maya, my love!
how did this happen!

229
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:50,003
You cannot leave me alone
and go away.

230
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:51,864
I cannot live without you.

231
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:01,984
Charu, you love me so much?

232
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:21,701
Oh my God!

233
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:35,048
I am lying dead here, and all
you can think of is the police?

234
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:36,499
Maya, you are alive!

235
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:40,632
What kind of a joke is this!

236
00:30:42,056 --> 00:30:44,196
- You don't love me.
- I do.

237
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,500
- You don't!
- I really love you.

238
00:30:48,562 --> 00:30:51,064
- Not at all!
- I love you very much.

239
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:52,065
Prove it.

240
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:55,134
What's wrong with you, Maya?

241
00:30:55,135 --> 00:30:57,425
What happened?
....What happened?

242
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:02,044
I....I’ll get your baggage.

243
00:31:03,577 --> 00:31:05,967
Go away!
Everything is fine here.

244
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:11,021
What happened? Where did you hurt
yourself? This is...

245
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,360
Does he beat you?

246
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:22,441
Does he have any vices?

247
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:26,099
No.

248
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:29,202
Any bad habits?

249
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:33,106
Another woman?

250
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,410
Then what is the problem?

251
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:44,134
Did Maya promise to spend her
entire life with this man?

252
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:47,649
All my life...with this man?

253
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:55,277
Charu, what do you enjoy most?

254
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,841
Reading, socializing,
travelling, music?

255
00:32:02,136 --> 00:32:03,406
What do you like?

256
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:06,718
Rain, thunder,
sunrise, sunset, what?

257
00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:09,642
You.

258
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,120
Far, very far away,
under the open sky...

259
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:23,085
Alone....the wind blowing...

260
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:26,659
The ground slipping away
from under my feet.

261
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,570
And it's noise
echoing in the mountains.

262
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:36,169
Come.

263
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:41,334
Mother has come.

264
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:51,343
- Bless you.
- Touch her feet.

265
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:54,687
Bless you.

266
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,690
Don't you feel ashamed?

267
00:32:57,691 --> 00:33:00,731
Married women should
not wear such clothes.

268
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:03,448
But times have changed now.

269
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:11,522
You have changed the
entire look of the house.

270
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:20,072
You eat food in glassware?

271
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:39,119
There is no prayer room
in the house? You don't pray?

272
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:46,147
Charu, your wife is
truly a modern lady.

273
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:59,159
And then, Lord Vishnu was
pleased with Narad's worship.

274
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:03,823
He appeared before Narad
and told him to ask for a boon.

275
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:08,349
He told the Lord he wanted to
understand...

276
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:10,782
the secret of the universe.

277
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:17,066
The Lord said it is not easy for
man to under this mystery.

278
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:22,632
When Narad insisted, he asked
him to take a dip in the pond.

279
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:25,278
Maybe he...

280
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:28,281
Help...help!

281
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:46,689
What are you doing!

282
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,223
Then she started keeping unwell.

283
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:11,734
What happened to her?

284
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,926
- I don't know.
- But you are a doctor.

285
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,830
My treatment didn't help.

286
00:35:18,232 --> 00:35:20,233
I took her a to a
hospital in the city.

287
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:22,035
I even took her to
renowned specialists.

288
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,037
She even undertook many tests.

289
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,105
But no one could say
what was ailing her.

290
00:35:26,106 --> 00:35:28,846
- Then?
- I decided a change of place.

291
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,045
I thought, maybe a changed
atmosphere would help her.

292
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,316
And we came here.

293
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,224
Papa, where is mummy?

294
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:39,941
- Mummy is lost.
- You are lying.

295
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:48,338
You go to sleep. Your mummy
will come in your dream.

296
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:49,562
Ask her.

297
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:52,565
Excuse me...

298
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,178
Come...come...
Enough....give.

299
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:04,143
How much money did
you make, Lala (trader)?

300
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:06,764
Nonsense sir.
In fact, I made a loss.

301
00:36:08,148 --> 00:36:10,583
- Come.
- We are aware of everything.

302
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:11,974
I have been ruined.

303
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:13,152
Be careful.

304
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,157
You don't know of the
expensive things I gave her.

305
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:22,095
Designer clothes, expensive
perfumes, unique gifts items...

306
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,162
all things of comfort.

307
00:36:23,163 --> 00:36:25,264
I kept giving on credit
on trust.

308
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:27,600
Forget interest, I doubt I’ll
even get the principal amount.

309
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:28,601
Careful!

310
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,109
- We'll talk to you later.
- Whenever you like.

311
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,850
We have to question you.

312
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,613
You only want to ask questions?
Come anytime.

313
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:43,234
I don't charge
for asking questions.

314
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,748
Come...I have heard you
are making investigations...

315
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:50,663
about Ms. Maya.

316
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,096
It’s really sad...very sad.

317
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:57,588
She was a fine woman;
a very fine woman.

318
00:36:57,631 --> 00:36:59,151
Why the investigation?

319
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:05,395
Her father is an influential
man. We have orders from above.

320
00:37:06,473 --> 00:37:07,873
You suspect someone?

321
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,144
It’s too early
to say anything now.

322
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,705
The doctor looks a
very decent man.

323
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,772
But one cannot
be sure about anyone.

324
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:25,795
Ms. Maya was very good...very
good, though she was strange.

325
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,670
- Strange?
- Did you know her well?

326
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,663
- Yes, and no.
- What do you mean?

327
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,076
A doctor and chemist
do need each other.

328
00:37:37,237 --> 00:37:40,597
They were new here, and
I am a well know man.

329
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:42,864
So they often took my advice.

330
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,678
What happened in their home,
they neither told me....

331
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,119
nor did I ever ask.

332
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,917
It’s many days.
Nothing has happened.

333
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:52,442
Yes, I have a daughter now,
Chhaya. Maya's Chhaya (shadow).

334
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,518
I have everything.
That is what everyone says.

335
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,292
Everyone says I am fortunate.

336
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,875
I don't dream anymore.

337
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,807
- I have a headache.
- Come, Lalit.

338
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,301
We were talking about
the doctor and Ms. Maya.

339
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,462
Meet them. They have
come for investigations.

340
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:56,486
He is Lalit. He is very decent.
He had left for the city.

341
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,812
But when he was here, even he
visited their home quite a lot.

342
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:01,514
He had become
almost like family.

343
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,435
- Did you know Maya?
- No.

344
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,039
I met her often
when I was with him.

345
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:12,325
It’s a small village, there are
hardly any people to talk to.

346
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:16,746
And anyway, how much can you
know a person in a few meetings?

347
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,005
Hello doctor!
I don't see you often.

348
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,341
Give me a chance to
entertain you some day.

349
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,502
Fall sick first.

350
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,847
- Welcome doctor. How are you?
- I’m fine.

351
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:36,768
Great! Even madam has come.

352
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,371
By the way, meet Lalit,
my wife's nephew.

353
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,422
- How are you?
- She is not keeping well.

354
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:45,403
Send me some multi-vitamins.

355
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,856
Try our new tonic. It’s very
good. It will help her.

356
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,836
Everything fell down.

357
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,647
I don't want it.

358
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:17,328
Just let me
know your taste once.

359
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:21,231
My shop may be small,
but I satisfy all my customers.

360
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,306
I don't want anything now.

361
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:29,999
Ask anyone. They will tell you
there's nothing I cannot get you.

362
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,810
- How much is this for?
- Don't worry about the price.

363
00:41:40,914 --> 00:41:43,934
- lf you like it, keep it.
- No, not now.

364
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:47,669
Alright, some other time.

365
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:51,531
All ladies are very happy
with me, except my wife.

366
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,533
Don't ever
worry about the money.

367
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,400
You must get what you like.

368
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,833
Tie it to him. Go!

369
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:23,716
What's this?

370
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,562
A glass piece.

371
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,424
That it is.
But where did it come from?

372
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,131
It seems to be a
piece of a broken jar.

373
00:43:39,132 --> 00:43:42,601
-Have you seen it before?
-There are so many jars here, sir

374
00:43:42,602 --> 00:43:44,522
Yes, but this is different.

375
00:43:45,038 --> 00:43:47,898
When you have lost
vigour and vitality...

376
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:52,545
when you almost want to
commit suicide, then brothers...

377
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,586
Hey man, wait!

378
00:43:53,514 --> 00:43:57,414
To rise in your own esteem,
to gain back your vigour...

379
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:03,029
and youthfulness, I have brought
you Shilajit from the mountains.

380
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,549
Shilajit of three types!

381
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:12,124
This was a herb.
Now see this!

382
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:17,971
A magic potion!

383
00:44:20,374 --> 00:44:23,994
Whoever drinks it,
will get his one wish fulfilled.

384
00:44:24,378 --> 00:44:28,238
Any wish, any desire,
any aspiration, will be fulfilled.

385
00:44:29,884 --> 00:44:32,384
You will get
whatever you ask for.

386
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:35,507
Just one chance
to change your life.

387
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:36,656
A magic potion!

388
00:44:37,892 --> 00:44:40,894
So brothers, don't any
of you have any wish?

389
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:42,562
Or do you not have the
courage to test it?

390
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:45,965
Doesn't any of you have any wish,
or lack the courage to ask?

391
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:49,976
What the world has come to!
No one has any desire left.

392
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:57,177
There is only one condition
while drinking this magic potion.

393
00:44:57,912 --> 00:44:59,979
Your intention should be clean.

394
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,130
lf you have no evil intention,
then ask without hesitation!

395
00:45:04,985 --> 00:45:07,785
But if you have
any evil intentions,...

396
00:45:07,922 --> 00:45:09,989
this magic potion
will ruin you so...

397
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:13,180
that even God will
not be able to save you.

398
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:15,995
Is there any clean hearted man
here? Come forward.

399
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:18,196
You will get what you ask for.

400
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:21,935
Why have you gathered a crowd
here? Go away!

401
00:45:21,936 --> 00:45:23,536
You are fooling
innocent people.

402
00:45:23,537 --> 00:45:26,439
You loot them. You poison
their minds. Go away!

403
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,541
- Go away, or...!
- Or what will you do?

404
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:31,010
- You go away!
- You dare to threaten me!

405
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:32,571
I’ll call the police!

406
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:55,916
The dreams have started again.
I don't want to get up.

407
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:57,971
But Chhaya...

408
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:37,010
What happened?

409
00:46:40,014 --> 00:46:41,014
Hey! Scram!

410
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:45,517
Come here.
Have you hurt your leg?

411
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:50,023
Chhaya is missing.
Where do I look for her?

412
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:53,026
- lf you like, I...
- But you...? - It’s okay.

413
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:55,767
- You can spare the time?
- Yes. Come.

414
00:46:56,096 --> 00:46:58,306
*The golden bird has flown away

415
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:10,043
You want to treat her to dirty
things from the bazaar & kill her

416
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:12,304
Who asked you to bring her out?

417
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:15,248
What if something
had happened to her?

418
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,029
Don't you dare do
such a thing again!

419
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:24,097
Take her home.

420
00:47:30,798 --> 00:47:31,798
Shall we go?

421
00:47:32,066 --> 00:47:33,066
Sorry.

422
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:42,742
Beautiful sights
don't please me.

423
00:47:42,743 --> 00:47:44,953
I feel suffocated in fresh air.

424
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,979
- What do you like?
- I don't know now.

425
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,883
What did you like before?

426
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:53,116
I don't know.

427
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:56,228
Let's find out what you like.

428
00:47:57,091 --> 00:47:59,361
- I’ll ask, you answer.
- Okay.

429
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:04,667
- A rotten egg.
- No.

430
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,100
A stick on the head?

431
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:10,313
A donkey's bray?

432
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:13,106
Stale food?

433
00:48:14,108 --> 00:48:15,508
An old acquaintance?

434
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:17,780
Uninvited guests?

435
00:48:18,612 --> 00:48:20,592
The prime minister's speech?

436
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:22,345
Strict discipline?

437
00:48:23,117 --> 00:48:24,457
Newspaper with tea?

438
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:26,802
Minority government?

439
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,885
Lightening, thunder, rain?

440
00:48:35,629 --> 00:48:37,149
An unfulfilled desire?

441
00:48:38,132 --> 00:48:39,182
Rising passion?

442
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,649
A sharp edged knife.

443
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:42,635
Movies?

444
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:48,309
Will you come
to the movies with me?

445
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:10,462
*lf the maiden goes away*

446
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:15,626
*I will call out to her
in every street*

447
00:49:19,673 --> 00:49:21,653
*Taking my life with her...*

448
00:49:23,677 --> 00:49:24,837
*there she goes*

449
00:49:27,181 --> 00:49:28,811
*She is always annoyed*

450
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:34,806
*I have tried
pacifying her so much*

451
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:46,977
*The shadow of a lovely gaze
has fallen on my heart*

452
00:49:53,707 --> 00:49:56,737
*Is she magic, a passion,
or an illusion?*

453
00:49:57,211 --> 00:49:58,211
*She's Maya!*

454
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:57,539
Maya, you are playing with fire.

455
00:50:58,772 --> 00:51:00,273
You'll burn yourself.

456
00:51:00,274 --> 00:51:04,584
But if you stop yourself, will
you be able to save yourself?

457
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:11,624
Take Chhaya inside.

458
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:32,274
I’d....bought this for you.

459
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:40,182
At least you brought thorns.

460
00:51:40,814 --> 00:51:43,614
No, even flowers bloom
on it sometimes.

461
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:51,324
Book?

462
00:51:57,331 --> 00:51:58,481
How's the book?

463
00:52:19,853 --> 00:52:21,593
Did you like each other?

464
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:25,436
- Did you love her?
- Or did she love you?

465
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,990
You are talking stupid.

466
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:30,863
She was elder to me.

467
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:36,529
She was married.

468
00:52:38,372 --> 00:52:40,232
- She was a mother.
- So?

469
00:52:40,874 --> 00:52:42,254
I didn't love her.

470
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:50,040
You are a grown up boy now.
Learn to be practical.

471
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:54,387
- I’ll just be back.
- Don't be late.

472
00:52:54,388 --> 00:52:55,768
I’ll be back soon.

473
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:09,311
I had come to say goodbye.

474
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:15,547
- I won't come now.
- Is it?

475
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:19,412
I...

476
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:22,614
Looks like it's going to rain.

477
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:24,807
I have an umbrella.

478
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,690
So you are going fully prepared.

479
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:31,103
I have no other option.

480
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:34,466
Each has his own compulsions.

481
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:38,521
I’ll be going.

482
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:34,487
What now?

483
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,670
I’ve brought these
specially for you.

484
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:43,634
One must keep himself
abreast of what's in.

485
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,220
The speed of fashion is such that
it changes even before you know.

486
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:55,495
You have been made
to be ahead of everyone else.

487
00:54:58,512 --> 00:55:00,492
I want to change everything.

488
00:55:00,847 --> 00:55:03,867
See it at leisure
and then just order me.

489
00:55:40,554 --> 00:55:41,554
And now?

490
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,980
Who is it?

491
00:56:08,081 --> 00:56:11,111
Thakur Rudra Pratap Singh,
can we come in?

492
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:18,789
- What do you want?
- A little of your time.

493
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:21,292
We have heard a lot about you.

494
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:25,197
- What brings you here?
- The search for Maya.

495
00:56:25,198 --> 00:56:28,288
'My destiny is in your hands.
Yours, Maya.'

496
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:31,874
What do you want?

497
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:34,607
The truth.

498
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:42,403
And what if I lie,
like these letters?

499
00:56:42,682 --> 00:56:45,192
That lie will become
your identity.

500
00:56:49,724 --> 00:56:51,464
What does all this mean?

501
00:56:53,027 --> 00:56:55,997
- What do you want?
- Tell us about Maya.

502
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:12,342
Call the doctor immediately.
Tell him Thakur has come.

503
00:57:21,055 --> 00:57:23,056
- What happened?
- He is injured.

504
00:57:23,057 --> 00:57:25,058
- How?
- He has been shot at.

505
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:27,219
Shot?!! Then inform the police.

506
00:57:28,062 --> 00:57:30,732
It’s nothing.
I was cleaning my gun.

507
00:57:33,067 --> 00:57:34,667
And accidentally pulled
the trigger.

508
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:37,468
The bullet has just
grazed my shoulder.

509
00:57:38,072 --> 00:57:41,112
But the blood...
Alright, bring him inside.

510
00:57:43,077 --> 00:57:44,417
Careful...this way.

511
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:14,465
Take care of him.
He has fallen unconscious again.

512
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:21,962
Whose eyes are these?
Why are they staring at me?

513
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:23,917
It scares me.

514
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:04,976
Where did Maya go?
She was here just now.

515
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:13,466
How are you?

516
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,512
I have got lost.

517
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:18,301
You have found me.

518
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:20,974
They must be looking for me.

519
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:23,977
They must be looking
because you are lost.

520
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,298
You were lost,
so you found me.

521
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,761
A fair is meant to
meet and get lost.

522
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:47,333
- Would you like a trip
to heaven? - When alive?

523
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,669
lf you like,
you can even touch the sky.

524
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,404
What if it falls on my head?

525
00:59:51,405 --> 00:59:55,008
Don't worry about that,
I’ll stop it on my shoulders.

526
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:56,009
Shall we go?

527
00:59:58,212 --> 00:59:59,822
I fear to step on it.

528
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:01,564
Gather courage.

529
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:17,288
- Ask him to stop.
- It’s just the beginning.

530
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,552
Seven rounds together.

531
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:21,034
I’m scared.

532
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,371
I’m feeling giddy.

533
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,137
Love is an affliction.

534
01:00:58,138 --> 01:01:01,228
lf afflicted,
it changes your life's goals.

535
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:05,116
Whenever I see a
beautiful woman unhappy...

536
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,930
I become compelled to love her,
to give her happiness.

537
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:12,310
You have an interesting record.

538
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:17,590
Many broken hearts.
So many accusations of betrayal.

539
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,671
- It is not illegal to love.
- Not at all.

540
01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:23,096
And then, what all
you had to suffer.

541
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:26,207
Blackmail, threats,
attempts to kidnap you...

542
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,100
and so many
attempts on your life.

543
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:30,553
I like taking risks.

544
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:36,076
The desire to get something,
and the feeling of victory.

545
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:40,360
They are all my life's highs,
my life's identity....proofs.

546
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:48,621
The style of loving
every girl is different.

547
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:51,292
It is foolish to
love only one girl.

548
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:54,627
And loving all
of them is meaningless.

549
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:59,058
Forget all that. Tell me, how
did the story proceed this time?

550
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:07,339
There is no end to a beginning

551
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:10,342
There is no end to a beginning

552
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:13,315
Right...wrong...right...wrong...

553
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,277
*Your blue eyes are beautiful*

554
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,976
*Let me be lost in them*

555
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:58,220
*This is the land of dreams*

556
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:09,639
*Open your eyes, why have you
curtained them with your lashes?*

557
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:15,485
*The shadow of a lovely gaze
has fallen on my heart*

558
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:25,246
*Is she magic, a passion,
or an illusion?*

559
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,220
*She's Maya!*

560
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:49,925
- You?
- Surprised?

561
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:54,166
What brings you here today?

562
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:57,098
I tried hard,
but couldn't stop myself.

563
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:10,562
Maya, forgive me.
Actually, I was sick.

564
01:04:11,832 --> 01:04:12,832
Sick?

565
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:19,100
- A sickness that has no cure.
- What sickness?

566
01:04:22,777 --> 01:04:23,777
Love.

567
01:04:29,784 --> 01:04:30,784
Forgive me.

568
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:40,542
That's why I didn't come here.

569
01:04:41,796 --> 01:04:45,336
I know you are not free.
You are someone's wife.

570
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:55,548
Help me, Maya.
Save me.

571
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:05,437
Perhaps I should
not have come here.

572
01:05:07,822 --> 01:05:09,962
I will go far away from here.

573
01:05:10,825 --> 01:05:11,865
Very far away.

574
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:13,827
Maybe...

575
01:05:19,834 --> 01:05:22,344
But after
looking into your eyes...

576
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:31,311
I want you to show me around
your house. You will, won't you?

577
01:05:33,848 --> 01:05:34,848
Come.

578
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:38,343
- Hello!
- Think of the devil!

579
01:05:39,854 --> 01:05:42,856
-We were just talking about you.
-How are you?

580
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:45,859
- I came to show you my wound.
- How's the pain?

581
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:48,770
It still hurts a
little below the heart.

582
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,365
Continue with the medicine I’ve
prescribed, you'll be fine.

583
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:53,867
And don't worry
about your heart.

584
01:05:53,868 --> 01:05:56,898
Actually, I had come
to invite you people.

585
01:05:57,872 --> 01:06:00,874
There is a beautiful temple
in the jungles here.

586
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,315
I want you to come.

587
01:06:02,877 --> 01:06:04,477
I’ll come and pick
you up tomorrow morning.

588
01:06:04,478 --> 01:06:08,238
I won't be able to come.
Maya, you go if you like.

589
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:14,645
I didn't want to go.
I wanted to go. I was scared.

590
01:06:14,989 --> 01:06:16,890
Scared more of myself than him.

591
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:20,081
But if I’d refused then,
it would seem odd.

592
01:07:07,842 --> 01:07:08,842
Please no!

593
01:07:33,868 --> 01:07:35,018
Dear, I’m going to cry!

594
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:57,390
How was it?

595
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:02,285
How was the temple?

596
01:08:06,901 --> 01:08:09,701
What happened?
Have I made any mistake?

597
01:08:11,405 --> 01:08:12,405
No.

598
01:08:16,911 --> 01:08:20,051
Don't you want to visit
any patients today?

599
01:08:20,247 --> 01:08:21,627
Oh yes! I have to.

600
01:08:23,918 --> 01:08:27,408
You look tired.
Don't forget to take that tonic.

601
01:09:06,086 --> 01:09:07,536
How did this happen?

602
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:27,867
*O roving heart*

603
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:30,710
*Go...*

604
01:09:31,712 --> 01:09:35,162
*O roving heart, release
yourself from all bonds*

605
01:10:15,756 --> 01:10:19,826
*The dream I see at night,
my heart lives it during day*

606
01:10:26,767 --> 01:10:29,677
*Wonder who it is
who touches my breath*

607
01:10:52,793 --> 01:10:54,193
*This heart says...*

608
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,430
*at least speak up once*

609
01:11:04,805 --> 01:11:06,145
*O roving heart...*

610
01:11:36,837 --> 01:11:39,737
*I desire to trap shade
in the hot sun*

611
01:11:47,348 --> 01:11:49,618
*I desire to fulfill my desires*

612
01:12:13,874 --> 01:12:16,154
* But this worldly heart says...*

613
01:12:20,881 --> 01:12:22,801
*let yourself go this once*

614
01:12:25,886 --> 01:12:27,226
*O roving heart...*

615
01:13:34,255 --> 01:13:35,255
You?

616
01:13:37,258 --> 01:13:38,878
How did you come here?

617
01:13:42,263 --> 01:13:45,823
- Your clothes are wet.
- Remove them if you like.

618
01:13:47,268 --> 01:13:49,308
You have become very naughty.

619
01:13:55,276 --> 01:13:56,276
For you.

620
01:14:03,284 --> 01:14:05,094
- No. - Yes.
- No. - Yes.

621
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:09,289
- It’s not right.
- You'll have to take it.

622
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:11,790
- You'll compel me?
- For my sake.

623
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,920
- You are a dictator.
- I love you.

624
01:14:27,308 --> 01:14:28,698
What is the matter?

625
01:14:34,315 --> 01:14:35,475
Are you alright?

626
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:40,419
What is the matter?.... Angry?

627
01:14:44,826 --> 01:14:45,826
Say something!

628
01:14:49,831 --> 01:14:52,511
Maya, you should
be a little careful.

629
01:15:05,847 --> 01:15:10,507
Why do the colours of dreams fade
away the moment you touch them?

630
01:15:11,352 --> 01:15:13,852
Will I have to
return here always?

631
01:15:14,355 --> 01:15:15,975
Is there no other way?

632
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,160
Look at this modern lady!

633
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:24,473
- Where had you gone?
- To watch a film.

634
01:15:26,367 --> 01:15:30,370
Why don't you tell her anything?
It’s the influence of films.

635
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:32,061
It is spoiling everyone.

636
01:15:32,373 --> 01:15:34,374
Even your servants are spoilt.

637
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:35,375
People talk.

638
01:15:36,444 --> 01:15:39,713
I have made this house
for myself, not people.

639
01:15:39,714 --> 01:15:41,504
I will live as I please.

640
01:15:41,783 --> 01:15:43,383
You cannot do
that in our family.

641
01:15:43,384 --> 01:15:44,654
What do you mean?

642
01:15:46,387 --> 01:15:49,697
Look, a woman's character
is like a dry leaf.

643
01:15:49,891 --> 01:15:52,893
Blow it a little, and it flies.
And you have caught wind.

644
01:15:52,894 --> 01:15:56,396
What world are you living in? The
world is going places & you...

645
01:15:56,397 --> 01:15:58,999
Wherever it may go,
but the norms of society...

646
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,068
Who has made these norms?
And for whom?

647
01:16:01,069 --> 01:16:04,139
This is my life!
I will live as I please!

648
01:16:05,073 --> 01:16:07,474
Alright then, even I won't live
in this house for a moment.

649
01:16:07,475 --> 01:16:08,475
I’m leaving!

650
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:17,533
Wonder what she
thinks of herself!

651
01:16:21,422 --> 01:16:23,490
- Mom, you cannot go like that.
- I won't stay here a minute!

652
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:26,671
- I won't let you go.
- I won't stay here!

653
01:16:32,433 --> 01:16:33,653
Apologise to mom.

654
01:16:37,438 --> 01:16:38,438
No.

655
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,942
- You should not talk like that with her.
- Never!

656
01:16:41,943 --> 01:16:43,803
Come and apologise to her.

657
01:16:45,446 --> 01:16:49,006
lf you apologise just once,
will you lose anything?

658
01:16:50,952 --> 01:16:52,462
I will not apologise.

659
01:16:54,455 --> 01:16:57,457
Maya, just think!
She is my mother after all.

660
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:59,459
You are her daughter-in-law.

661
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,461
She is so much elder to you.

662
01:17:01,462 --> 01:17:03,530
So what if she reprimanded you.

663
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:06,861
- Consider her age and
apologise to her.
- No.

664
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:12,610
Please Maya, I plead with you.
For my sake.

665
01:17:14,475 --> 01:17:15,645
Please apologise.

666
01:17:27,822 --> 01:17:28,822
I’m sorry.

667
01:17:47,508 --> 01:17:50,438
- Save me, Rudra, please!
- What happened?

668
01:17:50,578 --> 01:17:51,908
They will kill me.

669
01:17:53,014 --> 01:17:56,454
- Why? What have you done?
- What have you done?

670
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,540
Take me away from here.
I cannot live with them anymore.

671
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:08,699
Nor can I live without you.
I will suffocate and die.

672
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:12,532
I cannot live with the love you
give me in installments.

673
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:15,663
I want all your love.
I want it right now!

674
01:18:18,873 --> 01:18:20,323
Love is very fickle.

675
01:18:21,542 --> 01:18:23,682
It doesn't stay at one place.

676
01:18:24,545 --> 01:18:27,515
lf it doesn't increase,
it starts ebbing.

677
01:18:28,549 --> 01:18:31,399
There is a limit to
its increasing too.

678
01:18:31,552 --> 01:18:34,062
So one must recognise
that limit...

679
01:18:34,555 --> 01:18:37,755
and stop just one step before
and turn away.

680
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,805
lf you touch the limits,
love ruins you.

681
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,900
Cut out the dialogues
and give us the facts.

682
01:18:51,572 --> 01:18:54,082
Maya had made
all the arrangements.

683
01:18:55,576 --> 01:18:57,644
She was going to leave for
the city...

684
01:18:57,645 --> 01:19:00,035
on the pretext
of going shopping.

685
01:19:00,915 --> 01:19:03,115
I was going to meet her there.

686
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:06,604
And we were going to elope
very far away.

687
01:19:18,599 --> 01:19:22,629
Madam, Thakur Rudra Pratap
has sent these fruits for you.

688
01:19:24,605 --> 01:19:25,775
- Go.
- Alright.

689
01:19:46,627 --> 01:19:50,177
'Dear Maya, whatever I am
doing is for your good'

690
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:54,523
'Our union is not possible, so...'

691
01:19:55,136 --> 01:19:56,136
Madam...

692
01:20:04,645 --> 01:20:08,595
'So I am going far away from
your life; very far away'

693
01:20:16,157 --> 01:20:18,607
'Forever.
Forget Rudra if you can'

694
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:26,776
Madam...madam...

695
01:20:27,735 --> 01:20:31,235
This is not possible.
This cannot happen to me.

696
01:20:31,672 --> 01:20:33,822
How can this happen with Maya?

697
01:20:54,695 --> 01:20:56,675
Madam!...What are you doing!

698
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,700
Get down.

699
01:21:03,704 --> 01:21:04,704
Get down.

700
01:21:41,742 --> 01:21:44,844
- Can we come in? - Why have
you come here at this hour?

701
01:21:44,845 --> 01:21:47,945
- Something was left.
- What does this mean?

702
01:21:50,751 --> 01:21:54,821
- I have told you everything.
- You haven't told us everything

703
01:21:54,822 --> 01:21:58,252
- You didn't tell us some.
- You hid some part.

704
01:21:58,759 --> 01:22:01,428
- How can you say that?
- Because we found out.

705
01:22:01,429 --> 01:22:03,639
- What?
- That you lied to us.

706
01:22:05,766 --> 01:22:07,986
Look you are making allegations.

707
01:22:08,836 --> 01:22:13,086
Look kid, if you speak the
truth, less time will be wasted.

708
01:22:14,108 --> 01:22:17,777
It will mean less work for us
and less trouble for you.

709
01:22:17,778 --> 01:22:20,298
You are unnecessarily
suspecting me.

710
01:22:20,381 --> 01:22:22,111
Don't try to act smart.

711
01:22:22,783 --> 01:22:26,786
We know you have been meeting
her even later, and repeatedly.

712
01:22:26,787 --> 01:22:29,456
That's not illegal.
I have not committed any crime.

713
01:22:29,457 --> 01:22:30,787
No, you only lied.

714
01:22:32,293 --> 01:22:36,153
You..you...you... you cannot
prove anything against me.

715
01:22:40,801 --> 01:22:44,871
We have taken statements from
your landlord & all your friends.

716
01:22:44,872 --> 01:22:48,132
And even the hotel staff
where you met often.

717
01:22:48,476 --> 01:22:51,276
Believe us,
they have spoken the truth.

718
01:22:51,812 --> 01:22:55,362
So would you like to say
something now, Mr. Lalit?

719
01:22:58,819 --> 01:23:00,029
What could I do?

720
01:23:02,823 --> 01:23:04,743
It was entirely her desire.

721
01:23:07,828 --> 01:23:09,818
What she desired... happened.

722
01:23:18,839 --> 01:23:21,041
The films
nowadays are so idiotic.

723
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:25,132
Must they sing songs behind
trees after every two minutes?

724
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:42,030
- Recognise me?
- You?!
- Yes.

725
01:23:45,866 --> 01:23:46,906
Me once again.

726
01:23:48,869 --> 01:23:53,239
- How are you? - You can say
I almost died trying to survive.

727
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:55,715
Why, what happened?

728
01:23:56,377 --> 01:23:59,879
I’m seeing you after many days.
You have changed.

729
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,780
But you are just the same.
...Let's go.

730
01:24:04,885 --> 01:24:06,953
- Where...
- Charu, look who I met.

731
01:24:06,954 --> 01:24:10,794
- How come you are here?
- I stay here now.
- Is it?

732
01:24:11,892 --> 01:24:14,922
- I’m feeling suffocated here.
- Let's go.

733
01:24:23,404 --> 01:24:26,406
- No, I should be paying this.
- How is that possible?

734
01:24:26,407 --> 01:24:28,975
- Have you found some treasure?
- I’m working for a bank.

735
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:31,911
- You are younger to me.
- But you are in my city.

736
01:24:31,912 --> 01:24:34,981
- It was my duty to pay.
- But you are my guests.

737
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:37,917
- Where did you learn this from?
- One learns with age.

738
01:24:37,918 --> 01:24:39,878
I’ll go and wash my hands.

739
01:24:47,428 --> 01:24:49,398
Maya, I love you very much.

740
01:24:50,931 --> 01:24:53,099
My heart is restless, I see
you in my dreams all night.

741
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:55,001
- I was waiting for this moment.
- Leave my hand, please.

742
01:24:55,002 --> 01:24:58,138
Please stay back, Maya.
I have a lot to say to you.

743
01:24:58,139 --> 01:25:00,329
I won't let you go like that.

744
01:25:01,008 --> 01:25:02,008
Go away!

745
01:25:03,944 --> 01:25:06,446
I will wait for you from
morning at Scandal point.

746
01:25:06,447 --> 01:25:07,947
You'll have to come.

747
01:25:08,449 --> 01:25:09,949
You'll have to come!

748
01:25:15,956 --> 01:25:18,158
- Something happened?
- The water fell down.

749
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:19,609
Then shall we leave?

750
01:25:20,461 --> 01:25:22,462
How long are
you going to be here?

751
01:25:22,463 --> 01:25:24,393
Only until tomorrow morning.

752
01:25:24,965 --> 01:25:27,967
Won't you see the famous
exhibition of flowers?

753
01:25:27,968 --> 01:25:30,036
People come from all corners
of the world to see it.

754
01:25:30,037 --> 01:25:32,472
I have to see patients.
My staying back is impossible.

755
01:25:32,473 --> 01:25:34,040
Maya, you stay back if you like.

756
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:37,711
- You can return by the evening train.
- We'll see.

757
01:25:42,983 --> 01:25:45,493
I reached Scandal point
at sunrise.

758
01:25:47,988 --> 01:25:50,490
Forget a flower exhibition,
there wasn't a single flower...

759
01:25:50,491 --> 01:25:52,471
available in the whole city.

760
01:25:55,496 --> 01:25:58,816
Then I bought fake flowers
and waited for her.

761
01:26:02,002 --> 01:26:03,222
It was afternoon.

762
01:26:06,006 --> 01:26:07,506
But she didn't come.

763
01:26:14,014 --> 01:26:16,574
- Want a guide, sir?
- No; go away!

764
01:26:18,018 --> 01:26:19,619
I will take you
around all points.

765
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:21,020
I don't want to see anything!

766
01:26:21,021 --> 01:26:23,022
I’ll show you
sights that will awe you.

767
01:26:23,023 --> 01:26:25,024
- Go away!
- You can do as you please there.

768
01:26:25,025 --> 01:26:27,627
Cheap liquor, cheap hotel,
cheap fun...

769
01:26:27,628 --> 01:26:31,758
- I don't want anything!
- I’ll get you whatever you want

770
01:26:56,557 --> 01:26:58,427
- For you.
- Fake flowers?

771
01:26:59,059 --> 01:27:00,389
They don't wither.

772
01:27:01,061 --> 01:27:02,341
Are they fragrant?

773
01:27:03,063 --> 01:27:05,563
They will be,
once you touch them.

774
01:27:08,068 --> 01:27:11,468
Read this letter,
you will understand everything.

775
01:27:18,078 --> 01:27:21,728
Beautiful place, beautiful
people, beautiful things...

776
01:27:22,082 --> 01:27:24,012
- No.
- Madam, please come.

777
01:27:25,152 --> 01:27:29,212
Don't you understand?
I told you we don't want a guide!

778
01:28:13,133 --> 01:28:16,563
You cannot do this.
You cannot leave me and go.

779
01:28:17,471 --> 01:28:19,911
- Let me go.
- But what about me?

780
01:28:20,641 --> 01:28:23,142
What is the point in seeing
dreams that cannot come true?

781
01:28:23,143 --> 01:28:25,211
I understand everything,
but you...

782
01:28:25,212 --> 01:28:27,647
- You don't understand anything.
- But why are you doing this?

783
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:29,148
You are not a woman.

784
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:31,470
But what do I do?

785
01:28:33,153 --> 01:28:36,155
Just think! I fell in love
with you at first sight.

786
01:28:36,156 --> 01:28:37,757
I only dream about you.

787
01:28:37,758 --> 01:28:40,159
Believe me, I wrote so many
letters to you & tore them up.

788
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,661
Only for the fear
that you may take offence.

789
01:28:41,662 --> 01:28:42,762
So many times I felt I saw you.

790
01:28:42,763 --> 01:28:45,231
And when I ran towards you,
it would be someone else.

791
01:28:45,232 --> 01:28:48,668
It is your magic, Maya. It does
not leave me, nor can I leave it.

792
01:28:48,669 --> 01:28:50,889
I remember everything about you.

793
01:28:51,171 --> 01:28:55,041
Your clothes, your shoes, your
laughter, your fragrance.

794
01:28:56,176 --> 01:28:58,786
Maya please.
Don't leave me and go.

795
01:28:59,179 --> 01:29:00,739
I’ll die without you.

796
01:29:01,181 --> 01:29:04,771
I’m married, I’m elder to you.
You are so young.

797
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:10,229
Save me, Maya!

798
01:29:10,257 --> 01:29:11,577
Why didn't I die?

799
01:29:17,197 --> 01:29:18,347
Maya, I’ll die!

800
01:29:36,717 --> 01:29:38,227
I am not responsible.

801
01:29:41,221 --> 01:29:43,841
I am not responsible.
I had refused.

802
01:29:56,236 --> 01:30:00,236
Do you know what it is?
Don't you dare touch it again!

803
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,030
- What is the matter?
- What do I say?

804
01:30:03,243 --> 01:30:05,244
I asked him to get me
an empty bottle,...

805
01:30:05,245 --> 01:30:07,246
and he started touching
things in the shop.

806
01:30:07,247 --> 01:30:08,314
But what happened?

807
01:30:08,315 --> 01:30:10,316
Why did you have to touch it?
It can be poison too.

808
01:30:10,317 --> 01:30:11,751
Do you want to kill everyone?

809
01:30:11,752 --> 01:30:14,952
What is the matter?
Why are you beating him?

810
01:30:15,255 --> 01:30:17,857
- The maid told me there is some news for me.
- It’s bad news.

811
01:30:17,858 --> 01:30:19,759
I don't know how to tell you.

812
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,670
What's this?
Book on sex!

813
01:30:22,262 --> 01:30:25,392
- What is it, show me.
- It’s not for you.

814
01:30:25,766 --> 01:30:27,146
It’s a dirty book.

815
01:30:28,769 --> 01:30:29,769
What pictures!

816
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:31,270
Scram!

817
01:30:33,273 --> 01:30:35,883
What if my kids had
seen this book?

818
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:41,539
There was some bad news for me?

819
01:30:42,282 --> 01:30:44,672
Yes... your mother-in-law expired.

820
01:31:01,969 --> 01:31:02,969
I’m sorry.

821
01:31:04,972 --> 01:31:06,352
It was God's will.

822
01:31:24,992 --> 01:31:27,542
Can I talk to
you for two minutes?

823
01:31:36,003 --> 01:31:39,863
- Congratulations!
- How can you joke at such a moment!

824
01:31:41,008 --> 01:31:44,677
You don't understand.
She has left behind a lot of money.

825
01:31:44,678 --> 01:31:47,013
That is why
I am congratulating you.

826
01:31:47,014 --> 01:31:49,514
The doctor is
a simple man anyway.

827
01:31:50,017 --> 01:31:51,617
Where does he have the time
to spare from his patients?

828
01:31:51,618 --> 01:31:54,238
You take over
all the money matters.

829
01:31:56,023 --> 01:31:57,023
And...

830
01:32:00,527 --> 01:32:03,529
Just take an authority letter,
I’ll handle the rest.

831
01:32:03,530 --> 01:32:05,050
What authority letter?

832
01:32:05,532 --> 01:32:06,532
This one.

833
01:32:08,035 --> 01:32:11,875
Just take the doctor's signature
on this, that's all.

834
01:32:21,548 --> 01:32:25,048
Where did you learn
all these legal matters from?

835
01:32:25,752 --> 01:32:27,212
*Talking to myself...

836
01:32:34,761 --> 01:32:39,181
You sing so well. You have sung
after such a long time today.

837
01:32:42,566 --> 01:32:44,026
*Talking to myself...

838
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:54,443
- No singing from today!
- Why?

839
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:56,774
- I’m tuneless!
- Of course not.

840
01:32:58,448 --> 01:33:02,398
I could do only one thing well.
I have lost even that.

841
01:33:02,452 --> 01:33:04,472
But why do you have to cry?

842
01:33:04,521 --> 01:33:06,455
What do you know what's
going on in someone's mind?

843
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:09,959
You don't even know where
the spoons are in the kitchen.

844
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,527
You know how my work is.

845
01:33:11,528 --> 01:33:14,463
But have I ever stopped
you from doing anything?

846
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:17,034
Go for some music classes
sometimes.

847
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:21,689
- Sometimes won't help.
- Then?

848
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:25,862
- At least twice a week.
- Alright, twice a week.

849
01:33:25,876 --> 01:33:27,906
*Live in this heart and see*

850
01:33:35,986 --> 01:33:37,666
*This city is very old*

851
01:33:41,992 --> 01:33:44,492
*There is a
story in every breath*

852
01:33:48,498 --> 01:33:50,938
*There is a
tale in every breath*

853
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:54,686
*This is a very old city*

854
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:34,643
*In this heart*

855
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:39,998
*There is some pain*

856
01:34:42,052 --> 01:34:43,152
*And some slur*

857
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:06,133
*How many times
it has been ruined*

858
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:12,949
*And how many times
I have brought it to life*

859
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:15,503
*This city is very old....*

860
01:35:44,614 --> 01:35:46,644
*This body is but soft clay*

861
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:51,900
*It crumbles away*

862
01:36:14,144 --> 01:36:16,524
*lf someone holds it in his arms*

863
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:21,783
*It loses itself in them*

864
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:26,574
*This city is very old....*

865
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,050
You all are alike.

866
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:39,728
- What do you mean?
- Even you will leave one day.

867
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:43,059
- Where?
- Like others, to settle down in life.

868
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:48,294
Like others? You mean,
you loved someone else too?

869
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:50,929
- Forget it.
- Tell me.

870
01:37:51,741 --> 01:37:55,881
- Tell me. Did you love someone?
- Yes, but not like this.

871
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,818
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

872
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:05,599
- I don't.
- You do.
- I don't know.

873
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:10,016
- What don't you know?
- What you are hiding.

874
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,761
Forget it,
what difference does it make?

875
01:38:12,762 --> 01:38:15,902
I must know who else
resides in your heart.

876
01:38:16,266 --> 01:38:18,246
- There was one guy.
- Who?

877
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:20,328
He was killed in war.

878
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:36,285
Don't Maya.

879
01:38:38,288 --> 01:38:40,498
- Will you love me?
- No Maya.

880
01:39:18,328 --> 01:39:19,778
Will you drink milk?

881
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:23,461
- No.
- Just a little.

882
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:33,171
Look who has come.

883
01:39:36,846 --> 01:39:39,515
You are very late today.
I was beginning to get worried.

884
01:39:39,516 --> 01:39:42,017
You didn't have to,
the train was late.

885
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:43,919
- Madam, dinner is ready.
- I’m not hungry.

886
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,080
- Are you alright?
- Yes, why?

887
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,881
- What is the matter, Maya?
- Nothing.

888
01:39:56,866 --> 01:39:59,426
Do you attend
Mrs. Bhagat's classes?

889
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:01,870
Yes, why?

890
01:40:02,372 --> 01:40:04,940
I met her at
Mr. Khosla's place today.

891
01:40:04,941 --> 01:40:09,241
I mentioned her to you, but
she didn't even know your name.

892
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,570
She must have forgotten.

893
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:14,272
Yes, it's possible.

894
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:19,326
Maybe she is not that Mrs. Bhagat.

895
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:21,390
Possible?

896
01:40:25,895 --> 01:40:28,897
I have the receipts,
I’ll show them to you.

897
01:40:28,898 --> 01:40:31,218
It’s okay, that's not necessary.

898
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:33,281
No, I’ll show you.

899
01:40:34,904 --> 01:40:38,444
No, I’ll show you.
You want to see the receipts?

900
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:44,160
You want to see the receipts?
I’ll show you.

901
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:49,586
Just a minute!
You think I am lying?

902
01:40:49,919 --> 01:40:52,009
You want to see the receipts?

903
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:11,328
He cannot understand Maya's needs.

904
01:41:12,141 --> 01:41:14,221
That is why I am doing this.

905
01:41:14,944 --> 01:41:17,564
lf I stop,
my dreams will disappear.

906
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:21,950
Madam...

907
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:30,758
Madam, I need some money.

908
01:41:32,962 --> 01:41:35,742
- I don't have money.
- What do I do?

909
01:41:37,166 --> 01:41:38,967
lf so much of my
money gets blocked...

910
01:41:38,968 --> 01:41:40,569
what will become of my business?

911
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:44,473
- Wait for a few days.
- I’ll be on the streets by then.

912
01:41:44,474 --> 01:41:48,264
Look, I trusted you and gave
you whatever you wanted.

913
01:41:48,978 --> 01:41:52,428
- I understand, but...
- I need the money, madam.

914
01:41:52,982 --> 01:41:55,484
Or I would
not bother you even now.

915
01:41:55,485 --> 01:41:57,486
We can continue doing business,
only with give and take.

916
01:41:57,487 --> 01:41:59,447
You tell me, what do I do?

917
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:07,515
Sell something, madam.

918
01:42:08,498 --> 01:42:10,332
You have the authority letter.

919
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:13,753
I have a buyer who is ready
to pay in advance.

920
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:33,831
Feeling hot... Take this!

921
01:44:12,121 --> 01:44:15,771
I am tired of Maya.
She just doesn't let me stop.

922
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:18,516
She will devour me.

923
01:44:20,129 --> 01:44:21,339
I want to sleep.

924
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:45,554
Don't you feel ashamed!

925
01:44:45,555 --> 01:44:48,156
These are not
times to feel ashamed.

926
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:51,827
- She is feeling shy.
- Why are you shy of friends?

927
01:44:53,162 --> 01:44:54,162
What happened?

928
01:44:56,165 --> 01:44:58,085
We were testing your taste.

929
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:02,388
- Maya, come on, actually...
- Leave me alone!

930
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,140
- Maya listen!
- Go drown yourself!

931
01:45:17,186 --> 01:45:19,688
- Why did you come away
from there? - I don't know.

932
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:22,190
- You are drunk.
- And are you sober?

933
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:24,192
You have made
me lose my senses.

934
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:26,528
lf you could,
you would sell me too.

935
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:29,559
- Maya! Have you gone mad?
- Maya is dead!

936
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:33,039
- It was just a joke.
- It was a joke?

937
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:35,871
- Yes, it was a joke.
- It was all a joke?

938
01:45:35,872 --> 01:45:38,273
- Yes, a joke, and you...
- I am a joke?

939
01:45:38,274 --> 01:45:39,341
You are a joke!

940
01:45:39,342 --> 01:45:41,209
A dirty joke played on me,...

941
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:43,650
which doesn't even
make me laugh.

942
01:45:49,218 --> 01:45:51,478
- I am a joke?
- Yes, you are!

943
01:45:57,226 --> 01:45:58,226
I am a joke?

944
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:27,344
What have you turned me into?

945
01:47:08,297 --> 01:47:11,097
She is always
waiting for me somewhere.

946
01:47:13,302 --> 01:47:16,032
She keeps staring
at me all the time.

947
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:20,507
lf I die, her dreams will end.

948
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:23,760
She won't let me die.
She will kill me.

949
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:44,311
Have you seen Maya anywhere?

950
01:47:46,335 --> 01:47:50,235
She didn't come home last night.
Do you know anything?

951
01:47:50,339 --> 01:47:52,369
Say you met me last evening.

952
01:47:53,676 --> 01:47:55,356
I met her last evening.

953
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:58,025
I was not feeling well.

954
01:47:58,681 --> 01:48:01,461
I was...I mean,
she didn't look well.

955
01:48:04,854 --> 01:48:08,284
She said she will stay back
at someone's place.

956
01:48:08,357 --> 01:48:11,359
She said she will stay back
at someone's place.

957
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,360
Whose place?

958
01:48:13,362 --> 01:48:14,392
I don't know.

959
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:18,374
She doesn't know...I mean,
I don't know.

960
01:48:35,384 --> 01:48:37,452
What are you doing! How dare you
tear up a government notice!

961
01:48:37,453 --> 01:48:39,133
Why are you beating me?

962
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:00,475
Madam, people are saying...

963
01:49:00,476 --> 01:49:03,411
everything in this house
is going to be auctioned.

964
01:49:03,412 --> 01:49:04,412
See this.

965
01:49:37,947 --> 01:49:39,797
This is all Maya's doing!

966
01:49:40,449 --> 01:49:42,649
lf she wins, she will ruin me.

967
01:49:43,953 --> 01:49:47,663
I will have to stop her.
I will have to fight her.

968
01:50:20,489 --> 01:50:22,557
Where did you get
madam's purse from?

969
01:50:22,558 --> 01:50:24,559
- I found it.
- You are lying!

970
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:26,830
- She gave me.
- You are lying!

971
01:50:29,498 --> 01:50:30,548
Thief... thief!

972
01:50:44,513 --> 01:50:45,513
Leave it!

973
01:50:48,517 --> 01:50:52,927
We have the names of all the
people she met on the last day.

974
01:50:53,522 --> 01:50:56,024
You mean,
before she committed suicide?

975
01:50:56,025 --> 01:50:58,626
That hasn't been proved yet,
whether it was suicide or murder

976
01:50:58,627 --> 01:51:00,528
The question is that
if it was suicide,...

977
01:51:00,529 --> 01:51:02,030
why did she commit suicide?

978
01:51:02,031 --> 01:51:04,532
And if it was murder,
then who killed her?

979
01:51:04,533 --> 01:51:06,534
You mean you suspect someone?

980
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:09,537
- You only had laid the
conspiracy. - What nonsense!

981
01:51:09,538 --> 01:51:12,540
I was only doing business,
lawful business.

982
01:51:12,541 --> 01:51:15,877
What are you harping about law?
Are you teaching us the law?

983
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:17,345
Such a major incident
has occurred...

984
01:51:17,346 --> 01:51:19,047
and you pretend
like nothing has happened.

985
01:51:19,048 --> 01:51:20,815
No one did anything and
someone just lost her life?

986
01:51:20,816 --> 01:51:22,550
Is just what you did a crime?

987
01:51:22,551 --> 01:51:24,619
Isn't what you
didn't do not a crime?

988
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:26,070
Why make an issue...

989
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:33,680
We have to check
who is responsible.

990
01:51:34,563 --> 01:51:36,133
What were the reasons.

991
01:51:40,069 --> 01:51:42,209
I don't know why it happened.

992
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:45,071
I can only
tell you what happened.

993
01:52:00,589 --> 01:52:02,669
What kind of a joke is this?

994
01:52:03,592 --> 01:52:06,742
- Joke with you?
- Then what does this mean?

995
01:52:07,596 --> 01:52:08,986
You are very naive.

996
01:52:09,598 --> 01:52:13,378
What did you think?
I will give you credit for life?

997
01:52:13,602 --> 01:52:15,042
One has to pay too.

998
01:52:16,105 --> 01:52:18,355
Rs.150,000 is not a small sum.

999
01:52:19,608 --> 01:52:22,677
I understand,
but you cannot do this to me.

1000
01:52:22,678 --> 01:52:25,680
It is the court's decision,
what can I do about it?

1001
01:52:25,681 --> 01:52:28,241
I will pay
your every penny, but...

1002
01:52:28,617 --> 01:52:30,685
You should have
thought of it before.

1003
01:52:30,686 --> 01:52:34,689
It’s me who has to toil,
and you will enjoy the fruits?

1004
01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:36,291
You don't have to say so much!

1005
01:52:36,292 --> 01:52:39,372
So you will even stop
me from talking now?

1006
01:52:46,635 --> 01:52:49,605
What are you doing!
What will people say?

1007
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:52,707
You don't care for your
reputation, but I do.

1008
01:52:52,708 --> 01:52:55,978
- You are being rude.
- You are compelling me.

1009
01:52:56,645 --> 01:53:00,485
I will expose you. I will
even tell doctor about you.

1010
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:02,909
You can only tell,
I can show.

1011
01:53:07,656 --> 01:53:10,676
Look. What do you have
to say about this?

1012
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:14,133
Won't the doctor see your
betrayal in this?

1013
01:53:15,664 --> 01:53:18,733
But Lala, just think.
It’s such a huge amount,...

1014
01:53:18,734 --> 01:53:20,668
and you are giving
me so little time.

1015
01:53:20,669 --> 01:53:24,919
One who has friends like you do,
what problem can she have?

1016
01:53:25,174 --> 01:53:29,664
- I’ll sign on a stamp paper.
- I already have many signatures.

1017
01:53:30,179 --> 01:53:33,739
- I’ll sell something.
- You have nothing to sell.

1018
01:53:33,882 --> 01:53:36,684
How much do you need now
to stop the auction today?

1019
01:53:36,685 --> 01:53:39,475
- Rs.10000, Rs.20000?
- It won't help.

1020
01:53:40,789 --> 01:53:43,799
I plead with you,
give me a week's time.

1021
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:46,730
Your tears won't effect me.

1022
01:53:48,697 --> 01:53:51,907
Maybe Hetumal Sethia's
heart melts with them.

1023
01:53:53,702 --> 01:53:54,702
Madam...

1024
01:53:57,706 --> 01:54:01,016
Yes, she had come.
It was just a social call.

1025
01:54:04,713 --> 01:54:09,043
Nothing happened mean, nothing
that doesn't happen normally.

1026
01:54:26,735 --> 01:54:27,735
Come in.

1027
01:54:28,737 --> 01:54:32,237
- Your carpet will spoil.
- Don't worry about it.

1028
01:54:35,744 --> 01:54:38,834
- What brings you here?
- I need your help.

1029
01:54:40,749 --> 01:54:41,749
Is it? Come.

1030
01:54:43,752 --> 01:54:46,754
Nekchand has brought auction
orders from court.

1031
01:54:46,755 --> 01:54:48,135
I need Rs.150,000.

1032
01:54:50,759 --> 01:54:54,429
You've got yourself into a soup.
Why didn't you come to me before?

1033
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:57,870
- How was I to know...
- Maybe I am unfortunate.

1034
01:54:59,101 --> 01:55:01,411
- I’m in a hurry.
- Even I am.

1035
01:55:04,273 --> 01:55:05,833
So are you giving me?

1036
01:55:05,841 --> 01:55:08,821
- Yes. But first....
- What are you doing!

1037
01:55:09,778 --> 01:55:11,779
You are taking advantage
of my helplessness!

1038
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:14,970
You can take pity on me,
but cannot buy me.

1039
01:55:15,284 --> 01:55:18,184
Give and take is the
norm of the world.

1040
01:55:32,801 --> 01:55:34,771
Yes, she did come that day.

1041
01:55:35,804 --> 01:55:38,484
I didn't mention
it before because...

1042
01:55:39,808 --> 01:55:41,128
I don't know why.

1043
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:44,201
Maybe I am ashamed.

1044
01:55:45,814 --> 01:55:47,204
Maybe I was afraid.

1045
01:55:49,818 --> 01:55:50,818
Maybe...

1046
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:53,620
Maya, you?
At this hour?

1047
01:55:55,824 --> 01:55:58,434
- You didn't like it?
- No, not me.

1048
01:55:58,927 --> 01:56:01,907
The landlord objects
to women coming here.

1049
01:56:09,838 --> 01:56:11,868
I am in deep trouble, Lalit.

1050
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:17,870
You will have to help me.
I need Rs. 150,000.

1051
01:56:19,181 --> 01:56:21,916
- Are you mad? - Not yet,
but I will turn mad.

1052
01:56:21,917 --> 01:56:24,852
I have received a court notice.
If I don't pay up...

1053
01:56:24,853 --> 01:56:25,920
my home will be auctioned.

1054
01:56:25,921 --> 01:56:28,356
Charu does not
know anything about this.

1055
01:56:28,357 --> 01:56:30,858
- You can help me if you like.
- But how?

1056
01:56:30,859 --> 01:56:31,859
Do anything.

1057
01:56:31,927 --> 01:56:34,462
You can pay some money and
stall the matter for now.

1058
01:56:34,463 --> 01:56:36,913
Then do that. Do something!
Hurry!

1059
01:56:37,366 --> 01:56:41,869
-Can't you do that much for me?
-Who'll give me that much money?

1060
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:44,872
Bring it from anywhere. lf I was
in your place, I’d do anything.

1061
01:56:44,873 --> 01:56:47,553
Bring it from anywhere,
but bring it!

1062
01:56:47,876 --> 01:56:51,256
- Where do I bring it from?
- From your office.

1063
01:56:56,885 --> 01:56:59,685
Alright...not today,
I’ll try tomorrow.

1064
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:16,610
What can I do about that? I had
not called her, she came herself.

1065
01:57:16,905 --> 01:57:19,815
I am not responsible
for what others do.

1066
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:25,460
What is the matter?
Why are you crying like that?

1067
01:57:25,914 --> 01:57:27,194
Tell me something.

1068
01:57:29,251 --> 01:57:31,281
I am in deep trouble, Rudra.

1069
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:35,871
lf you don't help me,
I will be ruined.

1070
01:57:36,592 --> 01:57:38,162
But what has happened?

1071
01:57:41,930 --> 01:57:43,310
I need Rs.150,000.

1072
01:57:49,938 --> 01:57:51,268
Is it?...For what?

1073
01:57:53,942 --> 01:57:57,011
lf I don't pay by tomorrow,
my home will be auctioned.

1074
01:57:57,012 --> 01:57:59,282
But how did this situation come?

1075
01:57:59,448 --> 01:58:03,698
My husband gave all the money
to our lawyer. He cheated us.

1076
01:58:04,453 --> 01:58:08,703
Only you are my recourse now.
Please save my home, save me.

1077
01:58:10,459 --> 01:58:14,649
One who has spent all his life
with other people's help...

1078
01:58:14,963 --> 01:58:16,873
how can he help you, Maya?

1079
01:58:17,032 --> 01:58:20,872
You have my promise, Rudra.
You will have to help me!

1080
01:58:22,971 --> 01:58:25,281
I will not be able to help you.

1081
01:58:25,974 --> 01:58:28,042
Don't joke at
such a time, please!

1082
01:58:28,043 --> 01:58:30,063
I am not joking, it's true.

1083
01:58:32,981 --> 01:58:35,421
I have nothing
to give you today.

1084
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:36,984
You don't?

1085
01:58:39,988 --> 01:58:44,238
Whether you believe it or not,
all this grandeur is a sham.

1086
01:58:44,993 --> 01:58:46,143
This is a sham?

1087
01:58:50,499 --> 01:58:51,939
All this is a sham?

1088
01:58:53,001 --> 01:58:54,781
It’s you who is a sham!

1089
01:58:56,505 --> 01:58:59,507
lf I was in your place, I’d
sell even myself and help you.

1090
01:58:59,508 --> 01:59:01,428
I would beg, borrow, steal.

1091
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:05,500
I would stake my entire
life for your one smile.

1092
01:59:15,023 --> 01:59:17,163
I used to think you loved me.

1093
01:59:18,026 --> 01:59:19,526
But that was a sham.

1094
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:32,719
They all are with Maya.

1095
01:59:40,048 --> 01:59:41,558
I have been defeated.

1096
02:00:22,591 --> 02:00:25,031
There is no
end to the beginning.

1097
02:00:36,605 --> 02:00:37,605
What happened?

1098
02:00:38,607 --> 02:00:39,707
Where were you?

1099
02:00:41,309 --> 02:00:44,111
We've been looking
for you since so long.

1100
02:00:44,112 --> 02:00:45,572
Everyone was worried.

1101
02:00:57,125 --> 02:00:58,815
Help...help!
Save Maya!

1102
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:03,130
Help!

1103
02:01:21,149 --> 02:01:22,889
And the poor woman died.

1104
02:01:24,152 --> 02:01:25,372
A terrible death.

1105
02:01:27,656 --> 02:01:29,686
No one could have saved her.

1106
02:01:30,158 --> 02:01:33,138
Perhaps something like that
had to happen.

1107
02:01:33,495 --> 02:01:35,705
Perhaps that's what she wanted.

1108
02:01:37,232 --> 02:01:39,442
Where did the poison come from?

1109
02:01:39,668 --> 02:01:40,698
I don't know.

1110
02:01:41,236 --> 02:01:43,726
That's not true!
She is not dead.

1111
02:01:44,239 --> 02:01:45,399
Maya cannot die!

1112
02:01:46,174 --> 02:01:47,241
The boy has gone crazy.

1113
02:01:47,242 --> 02:01:50,244
No one believes me,
but I have seen it myself.

1114
02:01:50,245 --> 02:01:51,245
Honest!

1115
02:02:00,188 --> 02:02:01,808
Should I wish, or not?

1116
02:02:06,394 --> 02:02:07,784
That's the dilemma.

1117
02:02:15,203 --> 02:02:17,363
What happened?
Where were you?

1118
02:02:18,206 --> 02:02:20,207
Everyone is looking for you
since so long.

1119
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:21,668
Everyone was worried.

1120
02:03:06,755 --> 02:03:11,065
O magic potion, I have a clear heart,
and no evil intention.

1121
02:03:13,261 --> 02:03:15,531
Fulfill my desire.
I want Maya.

1122
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:32,959
- Give it to me.
- No!

1123
02:03:58,807 --> 02:04:00,077
There was a Maya!

1124
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:23,570
What's happening to me!

1125
02:05:28,396 --> 02:05:29,396
Help... help!

1126
02:05:40,909 --> 02:05:41,909
Save Maya!

1127
02:06:00,929 --> 02:06:03,729
*Sun during night,
and moon during day*

1128
02:06:05,934 --> 02:06:08,144
*Is what the stifled mind sees*

1129
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:13,599
* But it refuses to understand*

1130
02:06:16,444 --> 02:06:18,354
*lf it does, it finds God*

1131
02:06:21,449 --> 02:06:22,449
*High up...*

1132
02:06:27,455 --> 02:06:30,015
*The golden bird,
where did it go?*

1133
02:06:45,473 --> 02:06:47,283
What happened?
Who knows?

1134
02:06:49,477 --> 02:06:51,627
Why did it happen?
Who knows?

1135
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:53,640
What was gained?

1136
02:07:00,488 --> 02:07:03,368
Reason, no reason,
possible, impossible...

1137
02:07:05,493 --> 02:07:09,433
meaningful, meaningless,
everything is Maya (an illusion).
