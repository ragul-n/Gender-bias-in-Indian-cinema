1
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,420
l won't forgive the interest amount.

2
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,480
Repay the entire amount
within a week.

3
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,700
Yes?

4
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
Find out if the blueprint
for the new house is ready.

5
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,540
Where did you go?
Mother was asking about you.

6
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,670
- Why, sister-in-law?
- l don't know.

7
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,520
- Where is she?
- Upstairs.

8
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,670
- Yes, mother.
- Did you visit your aunt?

9
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,660
- Oh, l forgot.
- That's obvious.

10
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,350
l was mistaken in thinking
you'd take care of family business.

11
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,640
Mother, l'll surely go there
on my way back from work.

12
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,190
- Don't forget to go.
- l'll surely go.

13
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,260
Oh. Looks like the sun
has risen from the west.

14
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,490
May l ask the reason for
your absence yesterday?

15
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,760
- Why aren't you answering?
- Wait.

16
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,300
You've given me such difficult
problems, l can't solve them.

17
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:44,290
You won't. The questions are
simple, but you're a dud.

18
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,810
Sure. lnstead, why not admit
you're just a bad teacher?

19
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,240
How can l teach? You come one day
and are absent the next three.

20
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,940
Why didn't you come yesterday?

21
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
How could l come?
Aunt wasn't well.

22
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,280
l've to attend to the
domestic chores, too.

23
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,000
Keep doing the domestic work.
You'll never be able to study.

24
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,560
Sister, hurry up,
mother has called you.

25
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,540
- Why, what's the matter?
- l don't know.

26
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,670
There go your studies.
What an escape from trouble.

27
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,630
How can l be blamed for this?

28
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,530
Where is she?

29
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,120
- Aunt, did you call me?
- Where were you so long?

30
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,350
- l went to study.
- l know that.

31
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,070
lt's morning time.
So much work to be done.

32
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,680
How much can l do alone?
l don't have ten hands.

33
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,330
- What work can l do?
- l've asked her to cut vegetables.

34
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,130
You go and make
tea for your uncle.

35
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,810
- Why do you scream at the girls?
- l do that?

36
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,240
Telling them to work isn't screaming.

37
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,359
Your pampering has
spoiled these girls.

38
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,290
Hey. What are you doing here?
Don't you have to study?

39
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,290
Here.

40
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,650
You have to work a lot at your
poor uncle's house, don't you?

41
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,440
So what? Everyone works.
l'm only doing the same.

42
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,659
Please get the door.

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,560
- Master has called for
Mr. Gurcharan. - Alright.

44
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,080
- Uncle has called for you.
- l'll go right away.

45
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,810
- First finish your tea.
- No, you cover it and keep.

46
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,420
l'll return and finish it.
lf l'm late, he'll get angry.

47
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,010
l know why he's called me.

48
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,080
Brother, did you call me?

49
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,580
l was compelled to call you.  
l thought you were my neighbor.

50
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,210
l didn't need to follow up.
You'd come on your own.

51
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,450
Brother, l'll be obliged if
you spare some more days.

52
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,490
Haven't l given enough days?
lt's been almost a year.

53
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,219
Forget the principal. You've
not even paid any interest.

54
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,880
You're aware of my state.

55
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,130
l earn only hundred fifty
and have a large family.

56
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,010
Enough. What's the point
of telling me all this?

57
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,010
l just want to know when
you'll repay my loan.

58
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,280
- l'll repay it very soon.
- No. .

59
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,840
l don't want to hear
any of your excuses.

60
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,180
Shekhar's mother isn't well.
l've had to send her out of town.

61
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,400
That's why l need
the money desperately.

62
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,679
Repay the loan by next month
or you'll be in trouble.

63
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,760
Okay, you can go now.

64
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,340
- Send Munni upstairs.
- Alright, mother.

65
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,270
- What is it?
- Mother is calling you. Go up.

66
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,719
Coming, uncle.

67
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,289
This has gotten cold.
l'll heat it up.

68
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,729
l don't want tea. Just get
me a glass of cold water.

69
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,180
Here.

70
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,490
Father, give me my school fees...

71
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,890
or the teacher says
my name will be removed.

72
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,830
l'll give it to you next week.

73
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,490
Next week?
Then l won't go to school.

74
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,780
Girls tease me saying
that my father is poor...

75
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,110
and he has no
money for the fees.

76
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,010
Yes child, we're poor, very poor.

77
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,450
- Then father, you...
- Go out.

78
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,640
At home, outside, wherever l go,
l have to keep answering.

79
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,170
l don't know what l should do.

80
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,440
- Uncle. - This ancestral
house was my only support.

81
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,480
But this also was mortgaged
for your sister's wedding.

82
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,699
And now, l had to listen
to brother Navin's taunts.

83
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,990
Forget it uncle. What's the point
of thinking about it?

84
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,150
There's no point, but yet,
it keeps preying on my mind.

85
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,640
She is very beautiful and she's
fit for your house only.

86
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,330
That's right, l've seen your daughter.

87
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,500
But actually, let's
talk about the dowry.

88
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,380
Don't worry about that.
A girl's father is supposed give.

89
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,820
You perhaps don't know, but
for my niece's wedding...

90
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,390
we spent fifty thousand rupees.

91
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,530
- Right. - Actually, we really
like your son, Shekharnath.

92
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,319
And l want to make him
my son-in-law at any cost.

93
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,189
And the ten thousand you've
requested isn't a big sum.

94
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,100
- l agree to it. - Actually,
l'm not interested in dowry.

95
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,750
Whatever you give, will go to
your daughter and her husband.

96
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,160
- Then is the alliance fixed?
- Yes, it is.

97
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,569
- Sir.
- What is it?

98
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,130
- Madam has called you in.
- Why, what's the matter?

99
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,370
She says, until master
sees the girl, don't commit.

100
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,850
- Oh. Okay, you go.
- Okay, sir.

101
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,360
Perhaps, we've done something wrong.

102
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:04,040
- What happened? - The high
court inside will decide.

103
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,810
You please wait here.
Maybe she didn't understand.

104
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,600
- What do you mean by that?
- What?

105
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,000
l've already decided on the
dowry and the wedding.

106
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,949
You can see the girl as much as
you wish on the engagement day.

107
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,880
- Besides, the girl has been seen.
- Who has seen her?

108
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,160
- l've seen her.
- But it's your son getting married.

109
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,069
So what's the problem?

110
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,000
Please give a thought that
the times have changed.

111
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,230
Unlike our times, partners are no longer
chosen by the parents.

112
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,580
The boy has to be willing.

113
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,250
Do you know how much money
they're willing to give?

114
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,680
Whatever it is, until Shekhar
gives his consent...

115
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,240
this marriage won't happen.

116
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,860
- ls this the final decision?
- Yes.

117
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,670
What shall l tell them?

118
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,320
Tell them Shekhar will go to
see the girl next Sunday.

119
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,810
Your father is very
upset with me today.

120
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,940
That's really bad.

121
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,360
He has blood pressure problems.
He shouldn't get angry.

122
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,010
l know that, but listen to
the reason for his anger.

123
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,080
- What? - He's arranged your marriage
into the Chaudhry family.

124
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,920
The girl's father came
to fix the engagement date.

125
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,220
- No mother, l don't
want to marry now. - Why?

126
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,120
l've just started working.
Let me get established.

127
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,720
Listen to him, Lalitha.

128
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,870
As long as we're alive, why are you
worried about feeding your wife?

129
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,729
l've told your father you'll
go to see the girl on Sunday.

130
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,170
- Why are you quiet?
- What can l do?

131
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,510
- l'll go if you insist.
- Yes son, please go.

132
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,590
- Did you hear that, Lalitha?
- Yes, l heard it.

133
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,640
- Mother is calling you
to play cards. - Let's go.

134
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,280
Bring me the jar of
sugar from the kitchen.

135
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,740
Okay, aunty. You go.
l'll be right there.

136
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,710
- l'm going to Charu's house.
- To play cards again?

137
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,600
- Aunty has called me.
- Okay go, but come back soon.

138
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,689
You may go in.
Sister is in the next room.

139
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,420
Whom are you talking with?
Oh, it's Lalitha.

140
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:50,380
Recognize him? He's Charu's
uncle, my brother-in-law.

141
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,980
He doesn't like Munger
and is here on a holiday.

142
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,360
We've been waiting a long time
for you. Now sit down.

143
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,590
Why are you looking
in that direction?

144
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,030
No, l'm not.

145
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,140
Malti, play well or l'll
thrash you if you lose.

146
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,270
- And if l win?
- l'll treat you.

147
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,110
Come on, let's start the game.

148
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,500
Seventeen, eighteen...

149
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,900
- Give me a trump card.
- Charu give me the newspaper.

150
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,110
l'm playing, uncle.
Come here and get it.

151
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,110
Why do you want to read?
Come here and play with us.

152
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:47,260
What are you thinking? Didn't
you want this? Then why hesitate?

153
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,280
Come on, go.

154
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,680
- Did you call me here to play?
- Obviously. Come, join us.

155
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,810
- But four of you are playing.
- Charu doesn't know the game.

156
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,460
You help her. Sit here.

157
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,860
There'll be three of them
and we'll surely lose.

158
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,199
Don't get scared.
l'm enough for these two.

159
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,630
Come on now, play.

160
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,120
Not that one. This card.

161
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,150
- Hey. We won.
- Yes, l threw that card.

162
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,489
Oh. So you've made
yourself comfortable here?

163
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,319
l'm not playing,
l'm just helping her.

164
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,750
Soon you'll be playing
and Charu will be sitting here.

165
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,700
Card games aren't my cup of tea.

166
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,610
Oh, Lalitha.
Good that you've come.

167
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,569
Dress me so the girl
will pick me immediately.

168
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,319
- You're looking good but...
- But what?

169
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,280
Your Kashmiri shawl will
look good on this shirt.

170
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,880
- Then take it out.
- You do it yourself.

171
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,850
l've come to get the money.
l'll be late.

172
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,750
l take money whenever l need it,
but how will l ever repay it?

173
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,340
You are repaying me.
Don't you understand?

174
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,020
You'll understand one day.

175
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,069
- ls your father alright?
- Yes, he is.

176
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,089
Please come. First, have something sweet.

177
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,829
Son, go and bring
your sister here.

178
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,370
- Why have you laid out a feast?
- This is nothing.

179
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,740
When my brother's son-in-law
came here the first time...

180
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,290
we cooked 108 dishes for him.

181
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,060
Please eat. Here she is.

182
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,839
- Greet him.
- No, it's alright.

183
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,480
Sit down. Avinash, your father
has already approved her.

184
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,120
So you can ask her
whatever you wish.

185
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,400
- Where's the diamond necklace?
- What's your name?

186
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,620
Tell them your name, child.

187
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,950
Very lovingly, my
mother chose her name.

188
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,470
Because she is fair.

189
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,540
- Can you sing? - Very well .
Please sing for them.

190
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,360
- Son, go get the harmonium.
- Okay, father.

191
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:54,080
Shekhar, don't worry.
l'll hand her to you laden with gold.

192
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:02,420
You haven't eaten anything.
This is a special dish. Try some.

193
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,750
Avinash, did you like the girl?

194
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,690
Why don't you ask
the one getting married?

195
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,150
Tell me Shekhar, how is the girl?

196
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,770
Mother, their house is like a palace.

197
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,570
Huge pillars, marble steps...

198
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,440
Kashmiri carpets and
priceless ltalian statues.

199
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,780
That's all fine but tell me,
how did you like the girl?

200
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,850
How else can a girl from a good
family be? She was nice.

201
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,990
Just nice?
How was her appearance?

202
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,000
How is her complexion?
ls she fair like your sister-in-law?

203
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,630
Oh. So you think sister-in-law
is the most beautiful one?

204
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,340
- She's more fair than you.
- What's her education?

205
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,490
- l forgot to ask that.
- You forgot?

206
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,840
How could you forget to ask the
thing boys ask first these days?

207
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,990
What can l do? l forgot.

208
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,990
l don't think he liked the girl.

209
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,230
l agree.

210
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,370
Oh. So today you've got
time to tidy up my room?

211
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,850
Why aren't you asking
how l liked the girl?

212
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,890
What's there to ask?
She must surely be good.

213
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,909
She is.
Her house is like a palace.

214
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,570
Marble statues and the girl
was laden with gold ornaments.

215
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,820
- Why are you laughing?
- You're making me laugh.

216
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,820
Don't laugh. She's not as thin
as you who'd get blown by wind.

217
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,870
She's quite well built.

218
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,740
- Okay, then marry her.
- Yes, l will.

219
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,889
- Listen to me.
- No, l'm very busy.

220
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,970
l was waiting for this.
Here's my trump card.

221
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,120
Girin, from where did
you get the trump cards?

222
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,100
- l already had them. - Then
why didn't you throw it earlier?

223
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,640
- l did. - No, you didn't.
You men are all cheats.

224
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,460
Please think before you speak.
l'm a man.

225
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,070
- You be quiet.
- Okay.

226
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,900
- You've cheated. - Why don't
you check the previous cards?

227
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,919
That l will . Malti, check them.

228
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,320
Mother, it's 4 PM.
Aren't we going to the theater?

229
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,270
- Oh yes. Let's stop the game.
- Forget about the theater.

230
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,850
The game's going well.

231
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,419
We can't.
We already bought the tickets.

232
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,000
- Where are you going, aunty?
- To the theater.

233
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,580
- Girin has bought the tickets.
- Sister, let's go with them.

234
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,840
- How will we get the tickets?
- l'll send a man right away.

235
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,950
We can't make it. Aunty may get upset.

236
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,810
Please come along. lt will
be fun if we go together.

237
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,459
Yes sister, it will be fun.
l'll go and ask mother.

238
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,790
Let's get ready.
You go and get dressed.

239
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:23,850
You're taking everyone,
but why did you forget me?

240
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,830
lf everyone goes,
who'll guard the house?

241
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,200
You mean l'm the watchman?

242
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,160
No, l've reserved
a seat for you, too.

243
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:41,020
You're smart. Good that you're
not married or you'd be like me.

244
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,860
Sister, it's 5 PM
and you're not ready?

245
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,470
l'm ready.
Charu, where are my earrings?

246
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,150
- You put them in that cupboard.
- Oh, right.

247
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:07,570
- Hey. Aren't you ready yet?
- l've been ready for a long time.

248
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,649
- Let's go. - You'll wear such
funny clothes and come along?

249
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:16,280
- Don't you have any brains?
- l did, but before marriage.

250
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,860
Enough. Get ready soon.

251
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,310
- Aunty, we've come.
- Oh. Where is Lalitha?

252
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,690
l'm taking some money.

253
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,800
We're going to the theater.

254
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,620
- Everyone is waiting for me.
- What?

255
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,960
Now you've heard me.
We're going to the theater.

256
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,610
- With whom?
- With Mr. Girin.

257
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,570
- Who is Mr. Girin?
- Charu's uncle.

258
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,350
lt's been couple of days
since he came here.

259
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,240
He passed his M.A.
He's a very nice man.

260
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,189
- And he plays cards very well.
- Good.

261
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,700
You've gathered all the
information about him.

262
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,290
Looks like you've
played cards with him.

263
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,660
- Haven't you played a lot recently?
- What could l do?

264
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,040
Aunty called me and l went there.

265
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,550
After getting dressed,
you're seeking my permission.

266
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,980
Go. Why are you here? Go.

267
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,139
- Where's my betel leaf box?
- ln your hand.

268
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,520
Why not make it a pendant
and hang it on your chain?

269
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,889
Stop it.
l don't like such jokes.

270
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,580
Stop fighting.
lt's time for us to leave.

271
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,840
- We're ready.
- But Ms. Lalitha hasn't come yet.

272
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,190
Oh, yes.

273
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,030
- May l go?
- l already said you could.

274
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,590
- Let me go just once.
- Stop harassing me, Lalitha.

275
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,160
Do as you like.
You're old enough to think for yourself.

276
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,460
Sister, come on. The car is here.

277
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,700
- l'm not coming.
- Why, what happened?

278
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,470
l'm not feeling up to it.
You'll carry on.

279
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,980
Okay.

280
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,030
Take some money.

281
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,430
Sister's not feeling well.
She's not coming.

282
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,360
- What happened to her?
- l have no idea.

283
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,240
She told me she's not well.
Here, she's given this.

284
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,220
- Then we shouldn't go.
- We shouldn't go because of her?

285
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:29,070
- Ms. Lalitha was quite eager.
- What about our own eagerness?

286
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,930
Let's go.

287
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,409
Listen, l've had a dream...

288
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,730
that l become a king

289
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,350
Aren't you ashamed
to have such dreams?

290
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,399
See what lofty dreams he has!

291
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,500
Come to me now.
l'll cut your nose!

292
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,070
Become noseless!

293
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,879
What will people say
if my nose is missing?

294
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,380
Come and unite with me

295
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,680
lt's like The Beauty and The Beast

296
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:05,560
She called me a beast

297
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:13,080
Oh beloved, what have you done?

298
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:22,200
The lion had awakened.
You put it back to sleep

299
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:32,320
Oh beloved, what have you done?

300
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,560
Hey brother-in-law,
did you understand that?

301
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,580
- Sit down.
- Get up.

302
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,030
You won't get your nose cut.
You won't become noseless

303
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,560
You'll make me a queen
and you'll become a king

304
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,070
Yes, my dear. Yes, my dear.
l'll become a king

305
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,180
l'll make you the king.
l'll make you sit on the throne

306
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,679
Have patience

307
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,110
Under that throne
l'll dig your grave

308
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,409
Have patience

309
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,450
- ls anyone there?
- What is it?

310
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,389
Just check who's at the door.

311
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,970
Charu's uncle has come.

312
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,260
l was talking about him.

313
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,159
l've heard a lot about
you from the girls.

314
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,240
- Greetings.
- Greetings. Take a seat.

315
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,750
l heard that someone
is sick in your house.

316
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,000
Sick? No.

317
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:11,690
But yesterday l heard...
l must was mistaken.

318
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,770
No, you're right.

319
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,710
ln a house with children,
someone or the other is often sick.

320
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,330
The truth is that,
poverty itself is a big disease.

321
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,020
- Okay, l'll leave.
- Why are you going?

322
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,139
Sit for awhile.
l'm glad to meet you.

323
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,820
Nowadays, neighbors don't
bother about each other.

324
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,490
As long as you're here, do come here
whenever you get the time.

325
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,600
l'm home after l finish work.

326
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,399
l'm much younger to you.
Don't be so formal.

327
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,530
lt's always like that
in the first meeting.

328
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,990
Okay, l won't be formal. When
did you return from Munger?

329
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,690
- 2-3 days back.
- Will you have some tea?

330
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,060
- You're being formal again.
- Okay, l won't be.

331
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,920
- Tea? This time?
- ls there a time to have tea?

332
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,360
Actually, if you agree
to have some, then l will, too.

333
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,180
Okay, l'll have some.

334
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,150
- Sister isn't home, father.
- Where'd she go?

335
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,800
- To Shekhardada's house.
- Then you make some tea for him.

336
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,340
What time did you
return from the theater?

337
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,610
l asked what time you got home?
12 AM, 1 AM?

338
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,300
How was the theater?
l'm sure you must have enjoyed it.

339
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,659
Tell me, l want to hear.
Okay, don't tell me about yourself.

340
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,220
But tell me, did the one
you went with like it?

341
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,090
l didn't see it so l'll be
happy just hearing about it.

342
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,740
l don't know anything.

343
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,770
Shekhardada, quickly give me a rupee.
Sister's son is waiting.

344
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,970
- Sister's boy?
- Yes. Don't you know?

345
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,250
That old man who sings and begs
calls sister mother.

346
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,120
And says sister will marry a king.

347
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,649
Hurry up, give me the money.
l have other work, too.

348
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:26,730
Take it from under the pillow.
Listen.

349
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,110
- How was the theater that day?
- Very good.

350
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,090
- What about your sister?
- She didn't go.

351
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,990
- Didn't go? Why?
- l don't know.

352
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,730
She came back from your place
and said she wasn't feeling well.

353
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,900
She said she had a
headache and wouldn't go.

354
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,090
Hearing that, even Mr.
Giren was very upset.

355
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,580
Send your sister to me.

356
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,379
Take this, and Shekhardada
has called you.

357
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,409
l won't go.
l have too much work.

358
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,040
Mother, should l go empty handed?

359
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,500
Bless you.

360
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,700
May you become a queen.

361
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,670
lf you want to practice,
go in the next room.

362
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,020
But you tell me
what should l do?

363
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,510
lt's difficult to
spend the afternoon.

364
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,659
You keep yourself busy all day.

365
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,659
Then should l dance?

366
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,899
l meant to say that doing nothing,
it would be better...

367
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,320
to play cards.

368
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,540
lf it is so, then go
and tell your sister.

369
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,850
We'll arrange it immediately.

370
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,020
She is very fond of cards.

371
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,230
And if she gets a
chance to play...

372
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,360
she plays very devotedly.

373
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,210
- Shall l go?
- Go.

374
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,370
Listen.

375
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,590
Sit.

376
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,660
- What is it?
- Keep a distance.

377
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,780
Don't try to go too close.

378
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,960
They are high caste Brahmins.

379
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,830
But you're of lower caste.

380
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,719
You're an untouchable in their eyes.

381
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,620
What nonsense are you talking?

382
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,060
Yes, you'll find it nonsense.

383
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,000
You're still here? Please go.

384
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,840
Stop studying. Let's play cards.

385
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,050
No, aunty. l want to study.

386
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,640
What will you do,
studying so much?

387
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,900
After all, you'll play cards
in your husband's home.

388
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,620
No, aunty will be angry, aunty.

389
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,610
l'll convince her. You come.

390
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,450
Come on.

391
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,160
Put a trump on Giren's Jack.

392
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,690
No more trumps.

393
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,310
l won't play if you cheat.

394
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,600
Keep quiet. l'll play as l like.

395
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,110
- This game is ours, uncle.
- Pick them up.

396
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,060
Play properly, Lalitha.
We'll teach them a lesson.

397
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,620
But l can't play
for too long today.

398
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,779
Okay. You've just begun playing.
And already you want to go.

399
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,860
Here, take your pick.

400
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,850
- Annu, what are you taking?
- Milk.

401
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,500
Sister Charu's cat drank
the milk meant for Munni.

402
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,670
So l'm going to ask Aunty for some.

403
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,990
What's Lalitha doing?

404
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,190
She went to play cards
at Sister Charu's house.

405
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,640
- Who are all playing?
- Aunty, Charu and Giren.

406
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,440
Listen.

407
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,770
Go there and tell Lalitha
l'm calling for her.

408
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,610
Tell her to come immediately.

409
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,520
Here, we won the game.

410
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,310
Lalitha, pick up the Jack.

411
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,480
- Aunty, l shall leave now.
- Go, but play two more games.

412
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,930
Hurry up.

413
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,780
Why look at my cards?

414
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,200
Don't do that again!

415
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,780
Sister, Shekharda
has called for you.

416
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,690
She just sat down, and
she's here with a summons.

417
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,040
Go away!

418
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,730
Aunty, l shall leave now.

419
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,210
Finish this game.

420
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,070
No. He'll be angry.

421
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,810
The game was becoming
so interesting. She left.

422
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,090
Annu, did he just call me or
did he ask anything else, too?

423
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,060
He asked me what
you were doing.

424
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:37,049
l told him you
were playing cards.

425
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,160
He asked me
who all were playing.

426
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,169
l said, sister Lalitha, Aunty,
sister Charu and Giren.

427
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,320
Why did you need
to tell him all that?

428
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,399
lt's not my fault.
l told him whatever he asked.

429
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,589
lndeed. Now l won't give you anything.

430
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,670
l heard it at Mr. Gurucharan's
place, and today too.

431
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,110
Who is this Mr. Shekhar?

432
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,089
You know that house with a fence
near Mr. Gurucharan's house?

433
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,040
- That big house?
- Yes.

434
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,320
Shekhar is the younger
son of that family.

435
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,600
Lalitha has been studying
from him since childhood.

436
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,500
Shekhar has a lot
of affection for her.

437
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,060
- You were playing cards
at their place? - Yes.

438
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,899
Even Mr. Giren must surely be playing.

439
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,109
- Yes.
- You can't be found these days.

440
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,689
You've given up studying to play cards?

441
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,310
You know l don't like it?

442
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,540
l didn't go on my own.
Aunty made me go.

443
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,600
l don't believe this.

444
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,050
Believe it or not,
l spoke the truth.

445
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,180
l see. So nowadays you've
learned to talk too much?

446
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,759
You're not a child that
anyone can force you.

447
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,400
Why not just say you like
playing cards in that house?

448
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,120
And why wouldn't you?

449
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,200
You get good
companions to play.

450
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,520
Then go, your companions
must be waiting for you.

451
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,350
Why are you standing? Go.

452
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,730
What is it?

453
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,720
What happened, Lalitha?

454
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,940
Why are you crying?

455
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,490
Wish you could understand.

456
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,090
Mother, pack your things properly.

457
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,390
You have to go to Madhupur
for a change of atmosphere.

458
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,790
- No, l won't go this time.
- Why won't you go?

459
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,820
What's the use? l'm alright.

460
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,850
And your father isn't
in good health nowadays.

461
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,940
So l shouldn't go.

462
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:46,120
But he gave the instructions.
You must surely go.

463
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,900
Yes, mother. lt would be better
if you go for some days.

464
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,890
Don't worry about father.

465
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,360
l'm here to take care of him.

466
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,060
- But daughter-in-law...
- l won't hear anything.

467
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,240
l'll give money to Shekhar
to buy the ticket.

468
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,520
Alright. l can't argue with you.
Do what you like.

469
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,470
l'll arrange for your journey.

470
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,799
Listen.

471
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:14,150
Like every year, l'll take Lalitha
along with me this year, too.

472
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,280
- Get a ticket for her, too.
- Okay.

473
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,990
- Lalitha, tell your uncle.
- Okay.

474
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,259
Yes. Where's the calendar?
Aunt wants to check something.

475
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,960
On the table upstairs.

476
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,080
Daughter-in-law, tell the accountant...

477
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,300
to bring two nice
saris for Lalitha.

478
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,140
That poor girl doesn't
have good clothes.

479
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,279
- Uncle.
- What is it?

480
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,010
The mistress of that house
is going to Madhupur for a change.

481
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,549
She wants to take
me along with her.

482
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,290
Go if you want.

483
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,750
Tell your aunt.

484
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,030
Father, l want to get my
daughters married next month.

485
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,520
Select an auspicious
date from the calendar.

486
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,410
- l'll do it after l return.
- No, do it right now.

487
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,210
The calender belongs to someone
else. l have to return it.

488
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,570
You won't listen.

489
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,930
There's no other day,
except on Tuesday.

490
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,940
Then l'll have to conduct
the marriage this Tuesday.

491
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,520
The girl has grown now.

492
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,480
l don't want to keep her
in the house even for a moment.

493
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,190
She's talking like an old woman.

494
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,580
Are you going for
some important work?

495
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,130
No, it's not very important.

496
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,850
l'm going to meet someone.

497
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,870
lt won't matter if l'm
late by a few minutes.

498
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,069
Come in.

499
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,610
Meet my niece, Lalitha.

500
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,200
Yes, l was introduced to
her at sister's place.

501
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,450
Sit down.

502
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,890
l worry for her.

503
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,950
- What happened?
- Her parents are no more.

504
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,779
Until l find a suitable
groom for her...

505
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,020
l won' find peace.

506
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,620
l've told several people.
l'm telling you, too.

507
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,200
You have many friends.

508
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:18,550
Find a boy who doesn't
demand a dowry.

509
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,990
He should just like the girl
and get married.

510
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,360
l say confidently...

511
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,020
a decent girl like Lalitha
is hard to find.

512
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,430
Okay, l will try.

513
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,780
Do try, son.

514
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,080
Shall l leave? You have
to go somewhere, don't you?

515
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,600
Yes. Come some other day.

516
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,550
l'm sorry to hear
about Mr. Gurucharan.

517
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,810
That's not the only problem Giren.

518
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,190
The ancestor's house was a support.

519
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,730
That, too, he mortgaged for the
marriage of his elder daughter.

520
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,640
Forget the actual amount.
He can't even pay the interest.

521
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,080
And that old man is waiting
for a chance to seize their house.

522
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,510
- Who is the old man?
- Shekhar's father Navinrai.

523
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,250
Disgusting. l mentioned his
name early in the morning.

524
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,069
What's wrong with the name, sister?

525
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,740
Mentioning that unlucky man's
name ruins the whole day.

526
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,860
Yes, the old man is very cunning.

527
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,200
He traded in jaggery and
became a millionaire.

528
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,320
But he doesn't possess
any good qualities.

529
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,350
Avinash, did you see
Gurucharan's account?

530
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,870
- Yes, l saw.
- Send someone to find out...

531
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,210
if Gurucharan has
returned home or not.

532
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,110
lf he's back, then call him.

533
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,030
But sir, what's the use of
unnecessarily calling him?

534
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,589
lt's obvious he can't pay off the loan,
seeing the condition he's in.

535
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,460
l knew he couldn't repay me. That's why
l loaned him money in the first place.

536
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,400
So that no one else got his house
by loaning him money.

537
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,520
lt was better for me to give
him the money first.

538
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,690
l'm planning to demolish that house...

539
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,300
and build one for Shekhar.

540
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:57,450
He's our neighbor and we've known him
a long time, but what can we do?

541
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,990
l'll have to do this,
because my money is unavailable.

542
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,709
Anyway, forget all this.
l'll go inside. You send him in.

543
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,060
Okay.

544
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:15,460
You're so busy? You don't
come until we call you.

545
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,180
- Where is my money? - l've not
been able to arrange for it yet.

546
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,569
You couldn't? You guaranteed it
when you took the loan.

547
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:31,380
You said you'd surely pay back
the money within six months.

548
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:35,060
What about those six months?
Where is my money?

549
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,430
- Why are you quiet?
Say something. - l'm trying to.

550
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,750
You know my condition. lf you
give me some more time...

551
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,340
l cannot give even
one more day.

552
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,390
l notified you two
months back that...

553
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,240
l had to send money
to Avinash's mother.

554
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,940
l badly need the money.

555
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,129
But during these last two months,
you haven't even shown your face.

556
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,940
l gave so much extra time
because you're my neighbor.

557
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,950
But now, my final
decision is that...

558
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:07,700
if you don't repay all
my money within a week...

559
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,370
l'll be forced
to auction your house.

560
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:16,020
- But... - No buts. Anyhow,
arrange for my money.

561
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,319
Yes, you've given him enough time.

562
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:34,440
How can he repay your money.
Consider that house of his.

563
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,680
Oh God!
Why would l ever want that?

564
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,990
Gurucharan is an old, poor neighbor.

565
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,910
l would never want
to auction his house.

566
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,420
Now everything will go
according to God's wishes.

567
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,820
That's right.

568
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,810
- The tea is almost ready, uncle.
- Greetings.

569
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:12,870
Greetings. Come, sit. Lalitha,
Giren, bring two cups of tea.

570
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,440
- Okay. - How long have you
been back from the office?

571
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,400
l just returned.

572
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,089
- Sit, child. - Won't you have
some tea? - l don't drink tea.

573
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:31,020
No, her Shekhardada doesn't
like girls drinking tea.

574
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,620
You seem to be troubled.
Are you okay?

575
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,400
- Why? - No reason.
You seem to be lost in thought.

576
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,450
No. l am perfectly alright.

577
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,299
- Did something at the office...
- No, nothing like that.

578
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:57,120
No. You're right.
Today, l'm very unhappy.

579
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:02,319
Sometime back, in front of
some people of the society...

580
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,850
Navin said something,
as a result of which...

581
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,460
Why wouldn't he? lt's been almost
a year since l took the loan.

582
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,080
Forget the actual amount,
l couldn't even pay any interest.

583
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,570
Uncle, forget about all that.
Think about it later.

584
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,129
How can l? l think
about it all the time.

585
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,279
The thing is,
she doesn't want me to worry.

586
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,520
But there's no way to avoid it.

587
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:38,750
Navin has said if l
didn't repay within a week...

588
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,750
he'll auction this house of my ancestors.

589
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,460
lf you don't mind,
may l say something?

590
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,470
Mind? l don't mind
anyone saying anything.

591
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,359
- What is it? Tell me.
- l have heard from sister...

592
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:00,850
that Mr. Navin asks for
high interest rates on his loans.

593
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:05,180
So, l was thinking...
l mean, l want...

594
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,920
Look, my forefathers have
left me lots of money.

595
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,710
lt is just lying there.
lt's of no use to me.

596
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:17,490
- You repay Mr. Navin.
- What? You'll lend me the money?

597
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,360
- At what rate of interest?
- lnterest?

598
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,279
Loaning money is not my
business, Mr. Gurucharan.

599
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,150
Don't think l'm like Navinrai.

600
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,250
l don't consider them human,
those who lend money on interest.

601
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,890
Whenever you wish,
you may repay the money.

602
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,250
You'll give me the
full amount l owe?

603
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,280
Son, it's a lot. lt's Rs. 3000.

604
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,570
Rs. 3000? l won't have any
problem lending that much.

605
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,220
lf my money is of use
during your bad times...

606
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,230
then it'll be a matter
of pleasure for me.

607
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:56,500
Son, l won't ever forget
this favor all my life.

608
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,810
Don't embarrass me by saying that.

609
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,690
During bad times only,
one is a help to another.

610
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,100
- Mr. Giren is a very kind man.
- Yes, you are right.

611
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:12,430
Once when l was standing outside,
he gave me lots of chocolates.

612
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:14,530
Quiet Anu. You interfere in
everything. Go from here.

613
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:17,460
- What happened then?
- He said...

614
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,840
he'll give uncle the
full amount to repay his loan.

615
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,460
- Really?
- Yes, he said it in front of me.

616
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:28,690
l'm happy to know that uncle
will be able to repay the loan.

617
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,270
You've saved me from being ruined.

618
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:37,590
- How can l thank you...
- l remembered something.

619
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:40,260
You asked me to look
for a boy for Lalitha.

620
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,549
l've spoken to some people.
They want to see the girl.

621
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,730
- When?
- Soon. Whenever you say.

622
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,770
Call them next week.

623
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,350
But l heard she's going to Madhipur.

624
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,370
Yes, that is a problem.

625
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:58,290
Then she can't go. This is more
important than going to Madhipur.

626
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,870
- Yes. - l'll go and stop her
right away. - Okay, l'll leave.

627
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:03,500
The judgment shouldn't
be hidden from you all.

628
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,400
lf he doesn't repay the debt today,
l'll seize his house.

629
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,910
- Sure.
- Don't blame me later...

630
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,379
for being unfair to my neighbor.

631
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,520
No.

632
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,970
You can never be
unjust with anyone.

633
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,310
You've given him so much time...

634
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,300
that not even one's
own brother would give.

635
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,350
There he is.

636
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:29,150
Why have you made
such a long face?

637
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,310
So that you could
gain my sympathy?

638
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,800
Have you brought the money?

639
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:36,410
- l have.
- What?

640
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,170
- You've brought the money?
- Yes.

641
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,250
The whole thing?

642
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,960
Yes. Count the money.
And my documents...

643
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,030
Yes. When you have
repaid all the money...

644
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,640
then your documents
will be returned to you.

645
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,570
- Accountant.
- Yes, sir?

646
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,440
Return Gurucharan's documents.

647
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,910
Where did you get
so much money?

648
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,580
Don't ask that. The giver has
asked not to reveal his name.

649
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,230
Really? Why won't he?

650
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,470
lt's not your fault.
l'm to blame...

651
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,930
that l asked for my money back.

652
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:16,620
Bad times have come.

653
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,279
You're right!

654
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:23,430
What are you saying?
l've only repaid your money.

655
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,160
l can never repay your kindness.

656
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,280
lf there's even a little truth
in what you're saying...

657
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,110
you wouldn't have repaid
the debt like a stranger.

658
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,540
Tell me, for what interest
have you mortgaged the house?

659
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:41,930
No. l haven't mortgaged
the house this time.

660
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,860
And l didn't have to pay
any interest on the loan.

661
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,740
What are you saying? You got
the money without interest?

662
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:53,300
Who is that generous man?

663
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,220
Tell me his name.

664
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,069
We'll consider ourselves
fortunate hearing his name.

665
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,250
Excuse me. l won't say his name.

666
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,860
Okay, goodbye.

667
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,930
He left. He didn't
even give the name.

668
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:16,649
Haughty fellow.

669
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,670
l'll see how long this
secret remains unrevealed.

670
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,450
Who is that ignorant
person around here?

671
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,260
Why do you worry?

672
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:28,220
Within two days,
not only his name...

673
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,350
l'll bring all the
information about him.

674
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,230
Yes, find out.
There's surely something fishy.

675
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,450
Why do you worry?

676
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,600
We're here to obey your orders.

677
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,410
- Shall we leave?
- Okay.

678
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,090
Let's go

679
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,100
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

680
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,910
Can l have Rs. 10?

681
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,170
- Accountant. - Yes, sir?
- Give him Rs. 10.

682
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:02,810
- Come, Jugal.
- Greetings.

683
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,880
Father, the map you
had made by the engineer...

684
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,700
for Shekhar's house, is ready.

685
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,770
- Would you like to see it?
- Throw it away!

686
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,120
- Now there's no need for it.
- Why?

687
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,370
Gurucharan has repaid his
entire debt. Take this.

688
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,030
Shekhar has some expensive clothes.
They are so rich, aren't they?

689
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,890
Keep quiet. Don't talk too much.
Give me the kerchief.

690
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,040
Oh, l see all the arrangements
have been made.

691
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,230
Take this, too.

692
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,520
And pack your things, too.
You won't have time tomorrow.

693
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,100
- Sister won't go this time.
- She won't go? Why?

694
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,520
Uncle has said that ...

695
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,650
What did he say?

696
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,910
How will sister tell?

697
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:03,240
She's feeling shy.
Her marriage is being discussed.

698
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,020
- Marriage being discussed?
- Yes.

699
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:10,530
You don't know? Father and Giren
are looking for a groom for her.

700
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:13,069
Mr. Giren says, no matter how
much money is spent...

701
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:15,860
but the groom
should be like a king.

702
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,700
Brother Shekhar, Mr. Giren
is a very nice man.

703
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,080
lsn't he, sister? And did you know?

704
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,919
Father repaid uncle's entire debt.

705
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,960
Mr. Giren had given
the entire amount.

706
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,710
Father said, &quot;Now l'm free
of worries.&quot; Right?

707
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,610
What are you thinking?

708
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,160
- Nothing. Get me a 'paan'.
- Okay.

709
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,600
You didn't tell me all this?

710
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,350
Why? Why don't you answer?

711
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:06,520
Alright. You're a stranger
to me. l have no claims on you.

712
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,070
lt's good you found a kind
man to look after you.

713
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,920
The way he's trying hard...

714
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:21,040
shows you'll have
a suitable groom before long.

715
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,670
Remember us on the wedding.

716
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:36,709
You won't be able to do this
now. Come and do it later.

717
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,920
Whatever you may say,
Giren, l liked the boy.

718
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:46,300
Whatever you may say,
the boy isn't suitable for Lalitha.

719
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,120
Okay, as you wish.

720
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,710
Then go to see the other boy.

721
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,660
Come, Shekhar.

722
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,870
We were discussing Lalitha's marriage.

723
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,270
Come, sit.

724
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,980
Shekhar, don't you know him?
He is a very nice man.

725
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:06,250
He's our neighbor Madhavbabu's
brother-in-law Girendranath.

726
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,720
- Yes, l've heard of him.
- Greetings. - Grretings.

727
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:14,340
- Give it to Mr. Shekhar.
- He doesn't drink tea.

728
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,380
l went with Giren to see
about a groom for Lalitha.

729
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,720
The boy will soon graduate.
And he's from a good family.

730
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,150
But l wonder why Giren
didn't like the boy.

731
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,180
Why?
Why didn't he like him?

732
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,180
He's not quite good looking.

733
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:36,650
He says the boy should
be good in every aspect.

734
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,150
And my opinion is that a
man's looks aren't important.

735
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,690
The most important thing
in a man is his qualities.

736
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,300
What's your opinion?

737
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:49,700
- l think Giren is right.
- You've won.

738
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,460
Uncle, l'm going to Madhupur
with mother tomorrow.

739
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,520
Please inform me of the marriage.

740
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,940
What are you saying?

741
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,950
You people mean everything to us.

742
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:01,000
How can the marriage take place
before Lalitha's mother arrives?

743
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:02,649
Right, dear?

744
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:04,550
When did she go?

745
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,990
Perhaps she left because her
marriage was being discussed.

746
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,530
Yes, she should.

747
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,850
My daughter is more perceptive now.

748
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,400
Lalitha is a very nice girl.

749
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,350
She'll bring happiness to
whichever family she goes.

750
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,500
l can say with confidence.

751
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,339
When did he leave?

752
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,419
Strange boy.

753
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,680
l still couldn't understand him.

754
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:52,350
- What happened?
- Nothing.

755
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:58,110
l forgot to pack your overcoat.

756
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,810
Last time you had a problem
in the train because of cold.

757
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:04,830
l had it made as
soon as we returned.

758
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,710
Wear it if you feel cold.

759
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,510
This can never happen.

760
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:12,790
What can never happen?

761
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,220
Won't you wear it?

762
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,840
That's not it.

763
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,130
l was thinking about something else.

764
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:27,020
- Can you say how l'll feel?
- Why?

765
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,510
Only l know the reason.

766
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,529
Before getting married,
tell me where you put my things.

767
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,669
- Shut up.
- Okay.

768
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,410
But tell me if you can,
how l'll feel?

769
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,180
l have several hobbies.

770
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,620
But l don't have the capability.

771
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,490
Servants can't do my job.

772
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,180
Anyway, what will be, will be.

773
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,700
You won't come to see.

774
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,540
Say whatever you like.

775
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,020
Sister, we brought it.

776
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,069
Put it there and call Shanti.

777
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,259
Let's go.

778
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,670
- Are you making a garland?
- lt's my daughter's wedding.

779
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,490
l see. The wedding is today.

780
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,370
Can't you hear?

781
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,570
The music is being played
at Mr. Ghosh's place.

782
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,870
You've made all the arrangements?

783
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,410
What arrangements?

784
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,710
The girl has grown up now.
l have to get her married.

785
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:31,280
ls the garland of
these flowers acceptable?

786
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,290
Why not? lt is surely accepted...

787
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,810
if other flowers aren't available.

788
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:36,540
l've conducted several marriages.

789
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,910
l know the customs very well.

790
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,840
Oh God! l just forgot.

791
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:46,920
l invited everyone.
l just forgot Shekhardada.

792
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:49,350
l'll go and invite him.
Or he'll feel very bad.

793
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:54,640
- Sister, make this garland
until l return. - Okay.

794
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,750
Shekhardada, today is my
daughter's wedding.

795
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,110
l have come to invite you.

796
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,799
How did it happen suddenly?
l wasn't informed earlier.

797
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,259
How would you? lt was
decided only yesterday.

798
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,270
Father checked the calendar.

799
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:21,890
- Found there was no other
auspicious day. - l see.

800
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,150
- What does the groom do?
- Boss in the office.

801
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:27,610
Meek at home.

802
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:32,200
How can poor girls of poor
people like us get a rich groom?

803
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,550
When is the auspicious time?

804
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:39,759
There's no time left.
So couldn't arrange for much.

805
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:42,850
We have to manage it by
simply exchanging garlands.

806
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:46,549
Annu, listen.

807
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,480
- What is Lalitha doing?
- She's making garlands.

808
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:56,549
- Tell her to send it to me.
- That is for the groom.

809
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,040
l'll bring it.

810
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,930
Sister, Shekhardada wants a garland.

811
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,279
l'm busy. You take it to him.

812
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,670
l won't take it.
He told you to do it.

813
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:16,660
- Okay, give me one.
- Wait.

814
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,899
You do the work.
l'll take it.

815
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:24,380
lt's better you take it.
l have lots of work.

816
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,460
- What have you done?
- What have l done?

817
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,300
Don't you know?

818
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:09,540
Ask Annu what happens
by garlanding someone tonight.

819
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:14,550
Oh no. This isn't possible.

820
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,850
Lalitha, listen to me.

821
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:22,710
Do it fast. There is
lot of work to be done.

822
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,500
Dear Lalitha, Shekhar called you.

823
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,220
Are you asleep?

824
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,540
You go. l'll come.

825
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,220
lt's going to be 8 O'clock.
You're taking too long.

826
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:08,060
l know. Now there's no time.
Charu, bring gifts from mother's room.

827
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,120
What is it?

828
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:21,450
- Come inside.
- No. Say it from there.

829
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,230
What have you done unexpectedly?

830
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:26,070
Same thing again?

831
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,290
lt's not my fault. You did it.

832
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,790
l have done nothing.
Return my garland.

833
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,260
That's why l called you.
Come in and take it.

834
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,060
No. Throw it from there.

835
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,010
- You won't get it then.
- Forget it.

836
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,250
Wait, Lalitha.

837
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:53,029
- l'll complete it.
- No. What are you doing?

838
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:55,570
l'm doing the right thing.

839
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:07,390
Exchanging garlands is over.
Arrange for the other rituals.

840
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,500
- Why did you do it?
- Why did you do so?

841
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,520
l haven't done anything intentionally.

842
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:27,900
Why did you garland me?
l'm not worthy of you.

843
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,730
You're getting marriage
proposals from good families.

844
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,819
l'm poor.

845
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:40,589
Not worthy of you at all.

846
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:46,540
l have no parents.
No one at all.

847
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:52,980
- ls this why you're insulting me?
- No, Lalitha.

848
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,120
You're insulting me.

849
01:02:58,970 --> 01:03:03,720
- l'm insulting you?
- Yes. Ask your heart.

850
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:15,880
Did you do this because l
garlanded you unexpectedly?

851
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:23,149
lt wasn't an accident,
but done intentionally.

852
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:28,669
You were so close to me. Perhaps
that's why l couldn't know you.

853
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:34,210
Today l realized that l
cannot live without you.

854
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:40,930
But your father will be very
angry if he hears about this.

855
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:46,580
That doesn't matter now. What
had to happen, has happened.

856
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:51,280
And neither of us can
change what has happened.

857
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,730
Go down and seek
mother's blessings.

858
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:35,950
l'm not leaving until tomorrow.
Why are touching my feet now?

859
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:41,580
- Just... - l know your aunty
talked about your marriage.

860
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:45,859
l pray that you may get
a good husband.

861
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,270
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

862
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:56,160
l'm feeling very guilty. You had
to go through this because of me.

863
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,840
- l want to go away soon.
- No dear. Why should you leave?

864
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:03,100
lt's not your fault.
lt's not new.

865
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:07,400
Powerful men suppress
the weak. l'll leave.

866
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:13,190
That's will be right. You are ill.
We will go to Munger for few days.

867
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:16,760
Yes. Take me to Munger.
l don't like this place.

868
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,400
Okay, l'll make arrangements.

869
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,040
The other day what l said
rudely at Mr. Navin's place...

870
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:29,380
- l actually meant them.
- What is it?

871
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:33,390
That, if you have no objection...

872
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,710
l want to get my daughter
Lalitha married to you.

873
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:43,210
What are you saying.
You are tense right now.

874
01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:45,050
Let's discuss it another time.

875
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,230
- Will you do me a favor?
- What is it?

876
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:07,259
Go to the post office, get
 the address of Madhupur...

877
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:09,759
from Avinash and mail this.

878
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:15,720
- No. What if uncle breaks my legs?
- He won't do that.

879
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,880
Please, dear. l'll make a
pearl necklace for your doll.

880
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,810
Really? l'll do it.

881
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:26,379
- Listen. No one must learn about it.
- Okay.

882
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:50,520
Who is it? See who it is.

883
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,190
What is it, Annu?

884
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:02,589
l have to get Shekharbabu's
address written on this...

885
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,530
from Avinash and mail it.

886
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:08,000
- Whom are you talking with?
- Annu has brought a letter.

887
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,310
What sort of a letter?
Bring it here.

888
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,830
The letter is from
Gurucharan's house.

889
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,990
lt needs brother-in-law's
address written.

890
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,580
You may go.

891
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:48,270
Uncle, are we all
going to Munger?

892
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,760
Yes, dear. Giren has gone
to buy tickets for all of us.

893
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:59,200
l know you are sad
to leave this place.

894
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,550
But what to do?
l cannot stay here.

895
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:09,540
That's right, but l was saying...

896
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:12,260
Why did you stop? Say it.

897
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:16,160
l was saying, what's the hurry?

898
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:20,330
- After a few days...
- Got tickets for the day after tomorrow.

899
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:24,230
- You got the tickets? Good.
- Here they are.

900
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:29,689
- You keep them.
When's the train? - 9 PM.

901
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:32,280
We have to leave by 8 PM.

902
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,969
- You are fine, l hope?
- l'm fine, brother.

903
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:47,940
- How is your father's health?
- He's fine.

904
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:50,609
- Where is Munimji?
- Here he comes.

905
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,990
l'm taking them.
You bring the luggage.

906
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,299
Tie this up, too.

907
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:25,440
Sister, Shekhardada has come.

908
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:29,630
- Really? - The way is closed.
How will you go to meet him?

909
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:31,030
l'll be back soon.

910
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:40,070
Where're you going? Bring
utensils from the kitchen.

911
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:46,930
Wait. Don't close it. l have to
unpack my daughter's things, too.

912
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:53,500
You brought it? Keep it.
So many things.

913
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,090
ls it easy to move so many
things to another place?

914
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:02,389
Sister, help me tie the
bedding. l can't do it alone.

915
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,590
Okay. l'll be right back.

916
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:38,380
- Sister, come right away.
- Shekhar, did you meet Lalitha? - No.

917
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,220
- l heard they're leaving for
Munger today. - What for?

918
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:44,340
For Gurucharan's treatment.

919
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,450
Giren owns a house there.
l'm going to settle down there.

920
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,750
- They're leaving today?
- Yes. By the 9 PM train.

921
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:56,530
Daughter-in-law mentioned
Giren and Lalitha's marriage.

922
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,780
He isn't their caste.

923
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:01,639
l wonder why Gurucharan made
this decision suddenly.

924
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:07,510
But the boy is good,
educated and rich, too.

925
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:09,970
lt will end Lalitha's problems.

926
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:18,630
- Lalitha, is the tea ready?
- l'm bringing it, uncle.

927
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:22,340
You're taking unnecessary trouble.

928
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:26,730
They're packing and
you're asking for tea.

929
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,740
You don't know Lalitha.
She's good at work.

930
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:36,019
Here she is even before
l've finished speaking.

931
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:39,179
Give it to Giren.

932
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:44,340
- ls the packing over?
- Yes, uncle.

933
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:50,300
l was saying about Munger.
What a good climate.

934
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,990
You'll be fit within two days.

935
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:57,759
My brother-in-law told
me several times.

936
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,490
But l refuse to go
there with this fear.

937
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:08,450
You don't understand.
lf l put on any more weight...

938
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,270
l'll have to enlarge
the doors of my house.

939
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:31,370
- You all stopped laughing the
moment you saw me? - lt's not so.

940
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,070
Madhav was talking
about the climate of Munger.

941
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,830
l returned from Madhupur
with mother today.

942
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:40,450
l heard you're leaving.
So l came to see you.

943
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:46,500
Thank you. You know these
people very well, don't you?

944
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:52,190
l have no words to praise Giren.
He helped me when l was sick.

945
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:57,410
Bringing doctor, medicines,
taking care of me, everything.

946
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,120
He's like a member of the family.

947
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:02,450
How did your mother
feel in Madhavpur this time?

948
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,220
Good. l'll go now.

949
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:12,540
- What's the hurry?
- l have work to do.

950
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,940
- How is mother?
- Fine.

951
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:31,810
l want to tell you something. The
way to your house has been closed.

952
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,280
You people are responsible.

953
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:38,230
Mother is calling you.

954
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,540
- What is it Aunty?
- Where were you?

955
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,960
Hurry up and finish your work.
Did you go to that house?

956
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:53,500
- No.
- Go and seek sister's blessings.

957
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,320
And listen, take Anu with you.

958
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:11,419
Anu, what will you say
when you meet Shekhardada?

959
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:13,550
What should l say? l'll greet him.

960
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,780
No. Before you greet him, say...

961
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:21,450
&quot;Shekhardada, we've come to take
your blessings before we leave.&quot;

962
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,750
&quot;Knowingly or unknowingly,
we have committed many mistakes.&quot;

963
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:29,180
&quot;Please overlook them and forgive us.&quot;

964
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:31,840
- Understand?
- l have understood.

965
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:38,610
Shekhar Dada...

966
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:44,290
We've come to seek your
blessings before leaving.

967
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:56,349
Take these keys you gave to me.

968
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:01,500
We made many mistakes
knowingly or unknowingly.

969
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:04,309
Please forget those and forgive us.

970
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,740
Okay, you go home. l'll come shortly.

971
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:12,320
- Come soon. Father has gone to
fetch the vehicle. - l know.

972
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,000
Why didn't you reply to my letter?

973
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:23,860
- l didn't receive any letter.
- You received nothing? But l had...

974
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,280
What did you write?

975
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:28,620
l wrote lots of things.
You'd have remembered.

976
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,390
What do you command now?

977
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:35,210
Command? Of what
use is my command?

978
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:39,130
- Why?
- Whom can l command?

979
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:42,680
Look, this is no time
for fun and games.

980
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:45,210
l'll have to hurry.

981
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,120
l beg of you, please tell me
what will be the consequence?

982
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:49,830
I’m trembling with fear.

983
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:52,090
What sort of fear?

984
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,600
Won't l get scared?
There was an argument...

985
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,940
between the family
members in your absence.

986
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:00,280
That's the reason
we're leaving for Munger.

987
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,889
What about the money your uncle
borrowed from Giren babu?

988
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,490
That was a loan and l'll repay it.

989
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:10,670
From where will you
get so much money?

990
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,290
Don’t you know where
a married woman gets her money?

991
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,780
l'll get it from there.

992
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,599
But from whatever l
heard l presume that...

993
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,830
your uncle has sold
you for the money.

994
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:29,060
What? Whatever you've heard is false.

995
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:34,500
- Hurry up, sister.
- My uncle is a gentleman.

996
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:37,750
You don't know his sorrows.

997
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,040
Everyone else in this
world knows about it.

998
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:43,360
Are you talking of money?
He did take money...

999
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:45,350
but only after my marriage.

1000
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,850
Nor has he any right to sell me.

1001
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,700
And he hasn't sold me.

1002
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,590
lf anyone has the right
to sell me, that's you.

1003
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,460
You may repay that loan
by selling me, if you like.

1004
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:29,050
- Let's go.
- Okay. - Hurry up.

1005
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,990
Lalitha. What are you thinking?
Have you forgotten something?

1006
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:51,470
Come on.

1007
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,849
Oh Raadha

1008
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,570
Radha is leaving...

1009
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:27,120
with tears in her eyes

1010
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:31,740
Turning her face
away from her Krishna...

1011
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:40,610
Radha is going

1012
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,000
Leaving behind
her childhood memories

1013
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:56,280
Leaving behind Gokul’s verdant paths

1014
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:12,780
Parting from the
sweet notes of Krishna’s flute

1015
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:30,099
Rending a relationship of hearts

1016
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:35,170
Turning her face
away from her Krishna

1017
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:40,360
Radha is leaving
with tears in her eyes

1018
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,559
Turning her face
away from her Krishna

1019
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:07,220
The day has passed into twilight

1020
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:19,530
And look,
the fete has ended in Madhuban

1021
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:23,690
A lonely Radha...

1022
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:28,370
and a lone Krishna

1023
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:39,950
Look at the game the Creator plays

1024
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:44,430
Leaving behind
the light of separation...

1025
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:49,320
and turning her face
away from her Krishna...

1026
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:54,220
Radha is leaving
with tears in her eyes

1027
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:58,460
Turning her face
away from her Krishna

1028
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:26,390
Wow. lt's such a beautiful place.

1029
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:31,200
- The house is good, too.
- How long will we live here?

1030
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,080
We just got here.

1031
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,639
What's that noise about?

1032
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:41,270
Some boys are playing ball.

1033
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,670
Has the luggage been delivered?

1034
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,180
l'll find out.

1035
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:50,910
Malti, has the luggage been delivered?

1036
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:53,400
Yes. Did you go around the house?

1037
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:55,330
So large, so many rooms.

1038
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:58,750
- We will share one room.
- Take this box in.

1039
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:05,019
What's happening here? Why
should you take the trouble?

1040
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,810
Wait. Sitaram!

1041
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,840
- We're used to it. - Yes, sir.
- Where were you?

1042
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:13,050
Why didn't you take the
luggage in? Take them in.

1043
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:19,380
The rooms have been locked
for so long. They're very dirty.

1044
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:22,560
Ask the servants to clean up
the place. Here are your keys.

1045
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:27,910
Your aunty may need these keys,
so you may keep them with you.

1046
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:32,190
- How strange?
- What's the matter?

1047
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:36,750
l've forgotten my doll's groom.
What should l do now?

1048
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:41,090
Don't worry, we'll get
your doll remarried.

1049
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:43,800
What a silly answer that is.

1050
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:47,790
Can a woman marry twice?

1051
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,700
She talks like an old woman.

1052
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:55,930
Malti, you hold on to these keys.

1053
01:23:56,390 --> 01:24:00,440
- Where are my keys? Ramu?
- Yes, master.

1054
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,830
- Did anyone touch the table
in my absence? - l did.

1055
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,349
- l'd put my keys there.
- l didn't see them.

1056
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,360
Did they grow wings
and fly away then?

1057
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:13,960
You dare not touch my things.
Let my room be untidy.

1058
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:15,410
Okay.

1059
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,679
lt's strange. l don't
get anything in time.

1060
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,440
Why did you touch it again?

1061
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,850
Master, l've found the keys.

1062
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:47,170
Perhaps l didn't recognize you,
as you were close to me.

1063
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:52,490
But l realize that l
cannot live without you.

1064
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:55,410
God bless you.

1065
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:00,730
l heard that your uncle
made money by selling you.

1066
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:27,710
Why are you standing
in darkness, Lalitha?

1067
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:29,820
No reason.

1068
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,600
Listen.

1069
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,470
- May l ask you something?
- Yes.

1070
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:39,900
Don't you like this place?

1071
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:42,280
Why do you say that?

1072
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:46,660
l've noticed you've been sad
since you arrived here.

1073
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:49,570
You neither speak
nor do you go out.

1074
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:51,750
Did l hurt you in any way?

1075
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,810
Please don't embarrass
me by thinking that.

1076
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:58,470
You have helped
us in every way.

1077
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:01,320
Writing is your hobby, isn't it?

1078
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:02,810
Start writing then?

1079
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:05,000
l have lots of spare time.
l can help you.

1080
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,100
l had this hobby only
when l was in Calcutta.

1081
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:16,530
Why are you in tears, Uncle?

1082
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:20,480
You take good care of me.

1083
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:23,250
Even my daughters couldn't
care for me so well.

1084
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:27,230
l'm sure you were my
mother in my last birth.

1085
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:34,300
l dread the day you'll
be married and gone.

1086
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,690
Don't worry about that, uncle.

1087
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:42,429
- l won't marry.
- Why do you say that?

1088
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:48,500
Uncle, l wanted to tell
you something but...

1089
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:51,220
What's the matter, child?
Tell me.

1090
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:56,650
No, not now. You're unwell.

1091
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:00,010
lt's time for your medicines.
l'll go and get them.

1092
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:05,350
- What, mother?
- Call the doctor at once.

1093
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:06,879
His health is deteriorating.

1094
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:10,210
- Haria. Call him immediately.
- Okay, madam.

1095
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,599
Master, madam is calling you. Hurry up.

1096
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,790
- What's the matter?
- Master's unwell, come on.

1097
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:44,720
The situation is beyond
our control now, Shekhar.

1098
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:50,610
lt's a matter of a few seconds.
Be brave.

1099
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:03,960
There's a letter from sister.

1100
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:06,020
ls it from Charu's mother?
What's she written?

1101
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:09,099
Shekhar's father passed away.

1102
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:11,360
What? ls Navin no more?

1103
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:16,300
After your quarrel with him,
he fell sick and never recovered.

1104
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:18,730
He had a heart attack
yesterday morning.

1105
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:27,780
We had such good relations
with that family.

1106
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,310
l don't understand
why this evil had to happen.

1107
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,820
l'll be blamed for this incident.

1108
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:39,370
ls Shekhar's father no more?

1109
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:43,160
Yes. l'm responsible for his death.

1110
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:47,730
- What are you saying?
- That's right.

1111
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,730
Giren, l'm restless.

1112
01:31:52,150 --> 01:31:55,320
Help me, son.

1113
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:06,750
Please give me a piece of paper.

1114
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:39,210
lt's late at night, Lalitha.
You may go to bed. l'll sit here.

1115
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:08,850
- What's the time?
- lt's 4:10 AM.

1116
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:11,790
- Where are you, Giren?
- By your side.

1117
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:16,750
- Lalitha. - Uncle.
- You wait outside, child.

1118
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,019
l want to say something to Giren.

1119
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:23,099
- Where is your aunty?
- She just left. l'll send her.

1120
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:26,350
Giren, come close to me.

1121
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:31,740
l know that my end is near.

1122
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:35,870
- Please don't say that.
- l wanted to get Lalitha...

1123
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,300
married but couldn't fulfill it.

1124
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:43,910
But promise me that you will
fulfill my wish after my death.

1125
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:49,750
- Please don't hurry.
- No, if you don't promise me...

1126
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:52,420
l won't be able
to die in peace.

1127
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:54,890
There's no one to
take care of her.

1128
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,500
l want you to take the responsibility.

1129
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:01,440
Tell me son. Promise me.

1130
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:06,550
- Tell me. - l promise.
- That's enough.

1131
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:13,430
l can rest in peace now.
You have lightened my burden.

1132
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:15,970
l can rest in peace now.

1133
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:19,250
- What's the matter?
- Listen. - What happened?

1134
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:22,630
Listen. Giren has promised
to take care of Lalitha.

1135
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,640
And all of you as well.

1136
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:26,700
Call Lalitha at once...

1137
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:29,830
so that l can unite
them and die in peace.

1138
01:34:31,530 --> 01:34:35,610
Giren. l will be
indebted to you forever.

1139
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,660
Where is your hand, Giren?

1140
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:40,050
Give me your hand.
l have little time.

1141
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:46,179
l have no regrets.
l'm approaching death.

1142
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,510
- Shekhar?
- What is it mother?

1143
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:15,450
Mr. Chowdhry has come to
fix the date of marriage.

1144
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,129
Your father had promised him.

1145
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:20,940
lt's my wish and Avinash's, too...

1146
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:22,770
that you marry that girl.

1147
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,330
Mother, l've never
refused your wishes.

1148
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:32,410
But l want you to give
me some time to think.

1149
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:35,060
l don't want to marry yet.

1150
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:36,500
Why? What's the matter?

1151
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:43,040
l can't explain now. l'll tell
you everything another day.

1152
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:47,360
Okay, l'll refuse their offer.

1153
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:21,230
Shekhar, Lalitha is getting married.

1154
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,580
Aunty has sent a letter.

1155
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:28,519
l haven't seen my daughter
for many days. l wish to go.

1156
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,840
But how can l go?

1157
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:32,950
Anyway, even if l can't go...

1158
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:34,670
l must send some jewelry for her.

1159
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:37,750
Send someone to call the goldsmith.

1160
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:54,690
- Mother.
- What is it?

1161
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:58,510
You were discussing
my marriage, weren't you?

1162
01:39:58,530 --> 01:40:00,030
Yes, Mr. Choudhary has come.

1163
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:02,310
Send him the message that l'll get married.

1164
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,050
- l can't get married, aunty.
- What did you say?

1165
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,370
ls marriage a simple matter?

1166
01:40:08,150 --> 01:40:10,480
Before his death, your uncle
arranged this marriage.

1167
01:40:10,790 --> 01:40:12,490
And l've made all the arrangements.

1168
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:15,280
Now you're refusing?
For what reason?

1169
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,360
l can't tell you.

1170
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:21,910
lf you can't give the reason,
you shouldn't even say that.

1171
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:26,180
That uncle who used to love you
so much, you want to defame him?

1172
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,009
You want us to be disgraced
in front of the relatives?

1173
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:32,500
l won't listen to you.
You have to get married.

1174
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:43,440
Please save me, Mr. Giren.

1175
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,810
Except for you,
no one else can save me.

1176
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:47,370
Why? What happened?

1177
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,460
Tell me, Lalitha.

1178
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:57,040
l will consider myself fortunate
if l can help you in any way.

1179
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,599
l don't want to marry.

1180
01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:02,470
l'm already married.

1181
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:15,260
l know l've hurt you
a lot by saying this.

1182
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:19,840
But believe me. There was
no other way besides this.

1183
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:24,560
l'm married.

1184
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:26,390
You're married? When?

1185
01:41:27,230 --> 01:41:28,730
Almost 11/2 years have passed.

1186
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:30,809
But you never...

1187
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:32,519
l've hidden it till today.

1188
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,460
And if this problem
hadn't arisen...

1189
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:37,570
l wouldn't have mentioned it
even today.

1190
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:41,030
Who is your husband?

1191
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:44,599
A Hindu woman never mentions
her husband's name.

1192
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:49,330
Mr. Giren, don't tell
this to anyone...

1193
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:51,330
until my husband accepts me.

1194
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:53,330
This is my only request.

1195
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:56,490
Why isn't your husband
accepting you? That's not fair.

1196
01:41:57,970 --> 01:41:59,470
l don't think about that.

1197
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,940
He's my husband,
whether he accepts me or not.

1198
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:06,629
We have to stop
this wedding somehow.

1199
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,710
But all the marriage
preparations are complete.

1200
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:12,010
What should l tell your aunt?

1201
01:42:12,830 --> 01:42:15,340
Besides that,
if l break the promise...

1202
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:17,370
given your uncle
in his last moments...

1203
01:42:17,630 --> 01:42:20,430
it will be dishonorable of me.

1204
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,360
You've put me in a dilemma.

1205
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:30,290
l can't say anything right now.

1206
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:32,190
Please give me
some time to think.

1207
01:43:09,110 --> 01:43:10,690
No, this can't happen.

1208
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,380
Never.

1209
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:33,140
- Brother-in-law, mother has
called for you. - l'm coming.

1210
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,260
- You called me?
- Yes, son.

1211
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:46,460
Shekhar's wedding invitation
has arrived from Calcutta.

1212
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,360
- Shekhar's wedding?
- Yes.

1213
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:51,220
Shekhar's mother has
sent this letter.

1214
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:53,480
The wedding is next Monday the 29th.

1215
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:55,540
She's invited us all.

1216
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:58,670
And especially Lalitha has been invited.

1217
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:03,040
But this girl is ill.
How can l go?

1218
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,370
And if no one goes,
it would be bad.

1219
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,580
You tell me,
what should be done?

1220
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:10,490
We should surely go.

1221
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:12,929
Then you go to Kolkatta
with Lalitha and Malti...

1222
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:14,800
by tomorrow morning's train.

1223
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:17,160
Alright, l'll make the arrangements.

1224
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:19,880
And yes. Listen, son.

1225
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,540
While in Kolkatta,
sell off the house there.

1226
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:27,090
Why do you want to sell it?

1227
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:31,400
After he dies,
what will l do with that house?

1228
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:33,450
Sister, you're here? l
searched for you everywhere.

1229
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:35,650
- Why?
- l've brought good news.

1230
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,340
- What reward will you give me?
- What's the news?

1231
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,820
Shekhar's getting married.

1232
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,090
Brother-in-law will take
you and Malti to Kolkatta.

1233
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:49,690
Give me a reward.

1234
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:51,990
You're crying?

1235
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:55,860
No. Something must've
got into my eyes.

1236
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,480
Welcome, brother-in-law.

1237
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:19,310
The new couple has arrived.

1238
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:21,900
And you even brought your
sister-in-law along?

1239
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,650
- Why is the music being played?
- Don't you know?

1240
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:27,339
Shekhar is getting married.

1241
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,139
Lalitha, you've come
on a good occasion.

1242
01:45:29,160 --> 01:45:30,980
A few days will pass in joy.

1243
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:35,110
- Accountant.
- Yes, sir?

1244
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:37,430
- Did you inform the electricity board?
- l'll do it now.

1245
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:41,080
Now? l told you to
inform them since morning.

1246
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,099
And you're saying you'll do it now.

1247
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:45,250
You can't complete any
work entrusted to you.

1248
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,410
- Go and send someone immediately.
- Okay.

1249
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,240
You all haven't cleaned
the flower pots yet?

1250
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,150
You don't listen if told once.

1251
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:57,860
Come on, clean it.

1252
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:00,610
Any work given to you
is never completed.

1253
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:08,190
- Where is mother?
- ln her room.

1254
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:24,950
You've come for the wedding?

1255
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:27,490
l didn't want you to be invited.

1256
01:46:28,070 --> 01:46:29,469
But l didn't refuse...

1257
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:33,770
because the foolishness that took
place long ago shouldn't be revealed.

1258
01:46:34,170 --> 01:46:36,000
- Foolishness?
- No?

1259
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:40,330
- You proved it. - How did l...
- Let it be, Lalitha.

1260
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,570
l don't want to argue with
you on this auspicious day.

1261
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:48,400
But why are you
in this condition?

1262
01:46:49,370 --> 01:46:52,440
These torn clothes, glass bangles.

1263
01:46:53,510 --> 01:46:55,410
l've heard your husband
is a very rich man.

1264
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:58,110
Doesn't he appreciate
a noble girl like you?

1265
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:03,360
- No.
- Strange. But why?

1266
01:47:05,200 --> 01:47:09,540
He knows. l don't think about it.

1267
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,500
That's called a devoted wife.

1268
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:14,550
Such devoted wives
are very rare these days.

1269
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:19,590
Will you say everything?
Won't you listen to me?

1270
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:22,250
Why should l listen?
You yourself ended everything.

1271
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,860
Welcome.

1272
01:47:36,170 --> 01:47:37,570
Why are you sad?

1273
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:39,260
l've heard your father-in-law...

1274
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,980
will deck his daughter out in gold.

1275
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,430
Not only that. His father-in-law
is also going to present him...

1276
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:47,190
a bank as a gift.

1277
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:49,549
Sit down. Enough joking.

1278
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,180
Greetings.

1279
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,600
- You?
- Pardon me, Mr. Shekhar.

1280
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:00,660
Perhaps l'm not worth partaking
in this joyous gathering.

1281
01:48:01,090 --> 01:48:02,790
Even so, l was
compelled to come.

1282
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,810
But l want to have an
important talk with you.

1283
01:48:05,470 --> 01:48:06,970
What is it? Tell me.

1284
01:48:06,990 --> 01:48:09,120
lf would be better
if we spoke in private.

1285
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:12,040
They're my friends. Whatever
it is, say it in their presence.

1286
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:18,980
- A letter? Who's it from?
- My mother-in-law.

1287
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:23,250
- l mean Gurucharan's wife.
- l know that. Please sit.

1288
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:34,370
You didn't need
to come to me for this.

1289
01:48:35,290 --> 01:48:36,880
After father, brother manages everything.

1290
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:38,519
Meet him.

1291
01:48:38,670 --> 01:48:40,370
lt would've been better
had you told him.

1292
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:42,889
No, l can't do anything about that.

1293
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:44,700
You tell him yourself.

1294
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:47,050
And nowadays you're
looking after them.

1295
01:48:48,670 --> 01:48:50,070
Okay, l'll tell him.

1296
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:53,650
But sister said she didn't meet you?

1297
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,680
- She must be inside.
- Sister? Who? - Sister Lalitha.

1298
01:48:58,090 --> 01:49:01,070
- Who?
- Sister Lalitha.

1299
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:06,230
Sister Lalitha?
Aren't you married to Lalitha?

1300
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:08,400
No, l'm married to Malti.

1301
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,019
But wasn't your marriage
fixed with Lalitha?

1302
01:49:11,550 --> 01:49:13,030
Yes, that's true.

1303
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,830
But two days before the marriage,
sister Lalitha told me...

1304
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:19,990
she got married to
someone 11/2 years ago.

1305
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,200
Why are you shocked, Mr. Shekhar?

1306
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:26,870
No, it would've been better
if you all had left.

1307
01:49:26,970 --> 01:49:29,980
- l want to talk to him in private.
- No problem.

1308
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:31,740
Please sit.

1309
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:36,690
- Did Lalitha say she's married?
- Yes.

1310
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:39,500
Hearing this, l was in a dilemma.

1311
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:41,790
A Hindu woman marries only once.

1312
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:46,090
And before Mr. Gurucharan's
death, l had even promised him.

1313
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:51,880
After pondering a lot, l married
his other daughter Malti...

1314
01:49:52,370 --> 01:49:53,769
to keep my promise.

1315
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:58,160
- Did Lalitha give her
husband's name? - No.

1316
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:03,310
That noble woman pardoned
all her husband's sins...

1317
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:05,590
and kept his name
a secret till now.

1318
01:50:06,590 --> 01:50:10,580
But by showing surprise,
you've revealed that secret.

1319
01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:15,580
Mr. Girin, for some time
l've misjudged you.

1320
01:50:16,450 --> 01:50:18,380
l was unaware that someone
could quietly make...

1321
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,799
such a big sacrifice.

1322
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,900
You sit. l'll be right back.

1323
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:29,120
- Hariya? - Yes, sir?
- Where is Lalitha?

1324
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:31,430
She left some time ago.

1325
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:40,410
Give this to daughter-in-law.

1326
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:42,840
Shekhar will need this during marriage.

1327
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,360
This marriage can't take place, mother.

1328
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:49,460
What are you saying?

1329
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:51,470
You shouldn't talk like that.

1330
01:50:52,290 --> 01:50:53,980
l haven't said this before now.

1331
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:57,480
But it'll be a great sin
to keep silent now.

1332
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,000
What are you saying, Shekhar?

1333
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:02,150
- ls this a child's game?
- l'm saying it because it isn't.

1334
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:04,820
You've pardoned several
mistakes of your son.

1335
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:08,170
Forgive this mistake too.
l'm already married.

1336
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:10,780
You're already married?

1337
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:14,280
l don't understand anything.

1338
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:16,680
l'll be right back. Just wait.

1339
01:51:29,790 --> 01:51:31,380
- Brother Shekhar.
- lt's okay, Malti.

1340
01:51:31,770 --> 01:51:33,270
- Where's Lalitha?
- ln that room.

1341
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:41,010
- She's not here.
- Then where did she go?

1342
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:44,080
Sister.

1343
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:45,860
- ls she on the terrace?
- l don't know.

1344
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:47,889
- You look on the terrace.
l'll check the other room. - Okay.

1345
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:03,400
She's not there.

1346
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:40,300
Will you torment me by
keeping silent like usual?

1347
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:43,260
Come with me.

1348
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:13,440
Mother, she is your
younger daughter-in-law.

1349
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:16,720
- Who is she?
- l told you, mother.

1350
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:19,519
You've been her real mother
for more than a year.

1351
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,380
l can't say anything
more than that.

1352
01:53:22,930 --> 01:53:24,330
What are you saying?

1353
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:26,809
- She was married to Giren.
- No, mother.

1354
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:28,580
Giren has married Malti.

1355
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:31,190
She is your daughter-in-law.

1356
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:40,650
ls this true?

1357
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:45,760
But why are you
in this condition?

1358
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,000
l understand.

1359
01:53:49,570 --> 01:53:52,519
Goddess Parvati has to do great
penance to get Lord Shiva.

1360
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:58,030
Bless you, child.

1361
01:53:58,430 --> 01:54:00,680
Let me inform Avinash that
the bride has changed.

1362
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:07,070
What, mother?

1363
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:08,490
We'll see Mr. Choudhary...

1364
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:09,910
and cancel Shekhar's wedding.

1365
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:12,340
Call off the wedding?
But how can this happen now?

1366
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:13,980
This has to happen.

1367
01:54:14,110 --> 01:54:16,170
- Shekhar is already married.
- He's already married?.

1368
01:54:16,530 --> 01:54:18,730
Yes, l'll explain later.

1369
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:21,670
Get the car.
l'll go myself if necessary.
