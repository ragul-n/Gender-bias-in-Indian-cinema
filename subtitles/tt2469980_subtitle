1
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,124
Where is Jai, man?

2
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,374
He is on the way.

3
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,624
Save me! Please!

4
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,415
No.. No.. No.. No..

5
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,082
Do you know who l am?

6
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,999
Son of rich parents.
A spoilt brat. Rahul.

7
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,957
He knows me.

8
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,665
ln spite of knowing..

9
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,249
When a girl from our
country pleads for help..

10
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,957
..in a foreign land at night..

11
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,332
We should at least
try to help her, dude.

12
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,874
What? Will you beat me?

13
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,624
Problems will increase because of it.
They won't solve it.

14
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,915
We will find a solution
if we discuss for some time.

15
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,040
You!

16
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,665
Don't know how much
money you gave them.

17
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,457
They seem to take any risk.

18
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,582
This guy will be hit first.

19
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,499
l will hit him once
and he will fly in air and..

20
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,999
..fall down within five seconds.

21
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,999
This guy will get excited
after watching it.

22
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,165
He will raise his hand
and the chain in his hand..

23
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,624
One kick is sufficient
for him to fly..

24
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,874
Will the guy standing behind
you remain silent after all this?

25
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,957
He has got good muscles
but he doesn't know that..

26
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,665
..brain is more important than brawn.

27
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,665
l will hit him once..

28
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,790
lt will be something.

29
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,499
And then everyone
automatically decides..

30
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,332
..psychologically to come forward..

31
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,624
They will come one after another.

32
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,915
You are thinking
that he is just talking.

33
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,249
Watch the cut out
and believe it, dude!

34
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,207
But in order to do like this
l should kill the person inside me.

35
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,249
lf possible let us love, dude.

36
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,457
What is there to lose?

37
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,540
At the most,
the person might love you in return.

38
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,540
Hey, Rahul! - What is it, man?

39
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,832
Come on, man.

40
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,832
Tell me. What did he say?

41
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,082
Love all. - Bullshit!

42
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:24,832
Thanks a lot.

43
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:25,790
l am Manasa.

44
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,457
Hi. Jai.

45
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,040
l am afraid to think
what would have happened..

46
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,165
..if you were not there..

47
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,374
Forget it.
Are you from Hyderabad?

48
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,749
No. lruguvaram near Macherla.

49
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,999
Palnadu.

50
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,332
No.

51
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,415
Anyway forget the past and move ahead.

52
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,707
Good night.

53
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,082
Keep smiling.

54
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:59,332
lt has been once week
since you met that guy.

55
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,457
Will you still live in
flashback thinking of him?

56
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,207
You know about boys..

57
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,582
Had he forgotten you if
he too was disturbed like you?

58
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,540
He would have chased and harassed you.

59
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,165
Just forget him.

60
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,957
ls it him?

61
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,040
What are you doing here?

62
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,415
ls this your street?

63
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,207
That day at night..

64
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,874
lt was night and l
don't remember it well.

65
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,624
You said thanks..

66
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,999
Your name is.. Your name..

67
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,290
Manasa.

68
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,749
Manasa. Right.

69
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,040
What a coincidence?

70
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,582
My bike broke down
and stopped exactly..

71
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,915
..in front of your house.

72
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,457
Funny. Right? Really funny.

73
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,457
One sec, dude.

74
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,499
So what is up?

75
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,040
Too funny.

76
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,665
Bike too has started. Strange.

77
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,374
He too got disturbed.

78
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,124
Hi, girls. Jai.

79
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,915
lf possible then love him.
What is there to lose?

80
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,457
Blah! Blah! Blah!

81
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,749
You told them about me, isn't it?

82
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,290
That's really cool.

83
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:28,832
Coffee?

84
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,999
Hey, drink coffee and come to college.

85
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,832
Come on, girls.

86
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,749
See.. Bike too is ready.

87
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,582
Some other time.

88
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:43,749
lt is okay.

89
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,624
Hey, isn't it Jai?

90
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,749
Hi!
- Hi, girls!

91
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,707
Coffee is a silly thing.
l am so silly.

92
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,499
Wine and dinner tonight?

93
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:02,915
Sorry, Jai. l need to buy groceries.

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,665
Some other time. No time, baby.

96
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,749
Hey, Sushma! Didn't l tell
you to keep theses flowers there?

97
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:16,874
How many times should l tell you?

98
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,749
Manasa, why are you so late?

99
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,415
Everyone is waiting for you.
Come! Come! Come!

100
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,249
The entire house is cleaned.
Your room too is cleaned.

101
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,457
Go and freshen up soon.

102
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,707

favourite Chinese food.

103
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,957
Let us have dinner.

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,124
Sorry, Manu.

105
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,999
He has made your flat look beautiful.

106
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,749
He gave it a macho touch.

107
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,957
How will l not give small information?

108
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,582
Yes. You like Chinese food.
You like white colour puppies.

109
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,874
You like llayaraja's music.
You like watching sky and stars.

110
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,165
l swear! You don't
know anything beyond that.

111
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,707
Get ready, Manasa. l am very hungry.

112
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,040
Food will become cold.

113
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,832
That's not funny, girls.

114
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,040
Goodnight. Bye. Bye.

115
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:08,457
What is your program for tomorrow?

116
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,499

"Let's party in lndian style."

123
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,832
"So put up your smile."

124
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,040
"Hit it!"

125
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,165
"Are you ready?"

126
00:10:54,166 --> 00:11:02,624
"Oh, baby. Open the window."

127
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,415
"Life welcomes everyone."

"..like there is no tomorrow."

136
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,374
"Let's sing. Let's dance."

137
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,665
"Like you don't know
the meaning of sorrow."

138
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:39,332
"Life has trusted us.
Live up to its expectations."

"Come on. Everybody say yes."

157
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,374
"You cannot find the
true meaning of life even in..

158
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,040
..Oxford dictionary."

159
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:54,749
"Mix the happiness with
the oxygen found outside."

160
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,665
"Continue the celebrations.."

161
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,499
"Go with the wind.."

162
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,957
"Sky is the limit for us."

163
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,874
"Nothing can stop us.."

164
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,540
"Life can do nothing unless
you initiate something."

165
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,749
"You have to know it."

166
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:33,332
"Come on. Everybody say yes."

167
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,790

Had fun?

171
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,999
No, Jai.

172
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,624
lt is the best time.

173
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,624
Jai, it will be good if
entire life is spent like this.

174
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,832
lt depends on us, Manasa.

175
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,249
Our life is in our hands.

176
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,582
No, Jai.

177
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,540
My life can never become like that.

178
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,999
My family.. My Village..
The people are different, Jai.

179
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,999
They know only to
kill and seek revenge.

180
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,832
They don't know to love
and live life like you.

181
00:15:55,583 --> 00:16:02,249
l tried hard and could come
till here after studying in America.

182
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:07,249
l should go back to that
hell after completing my studies.

183
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:14,540
But after watching you,
l wish to live like you..

184
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:20,165
l wish to be with you
and remain happy all my life.

185
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,332
Manasa, what is wrong
in living happily?

186
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,540
l will stay happy as
long as l stay here with you.

187
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:32,999
But l cannot take this
happiness with me to my village.

188
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,915
Henceforth let me
live my previous life.

189
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,874
Please don't meet me again.

190
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,290
Don't ever see me again.

191
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,624
Everyone is going abroad for studies.

192
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,499
What is it with you?
Why did you come to lndia from abroad?

193
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,415
For a girl, sir.

194
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,915
Be careful with him.
He is doing this since ten years.

195
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,957
Students whojoined with
him have become lecturers.

196
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,665
This will be the result
if you interfere..

197
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,332
..with our brother Poorna.

198
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,832
Yuck! Where did this fellow come from?

199
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,290
He is giving us nightmares.

200
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:25,082
lf this continues then
we will become fools.

201
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,707
We should break his bones..

202
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,582
We should make him fear us.

203
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:34,874
"Brother, you have become very great!"

204
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,207
"Oh, brother."

205
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,082
Don't think of anybody. Finish him!

206
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,624
Don't think of me at all.

207
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,207
Who are you?
- l will thrash him!

208
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,249
Dude! Dude! Dude!

209
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,707
Leave Poorna to me. l will handle him.

210
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,790
Hey! l have come prepared
to break their knees.

211
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,165
You don't trouble me.

212
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,665
l have understood your tempo. Wait.

213
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:07,832
Toss the coin.. Toss..

214
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,624
Whoever wins the toss
will get to beat Poorna.

215
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,582
What is your toss nuisance in between?

216
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:12,874
You move aside. l will thrash them!

217
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,082
Fatty dude! You are getting excited.

218
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,165
Okay. Let us do something.

219
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,165
Let us both fight.
Whoever wins will get to fight Poorna.

220
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,290
Though l am not emotional like you..

221
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,207
..l think l can handle him better.

222
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:39,290
Emotional or crap?
Everything is over action.

223
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,040
What is there that you don't know?

224
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,124
You are in good form.

225
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,374
You are the right person
to handle this matter.

226
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,249
Greetings, brother.
Bye.

227
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,499
This rascal is good for nothing.
ltem guy!

228
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,207
Dudes!
- Brother.

229
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,665
Hope you don't chase
me tomorrow after sparing him.

230
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,374
Stop it, brother.
Tomorrow we have an entrance exam.

231
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,707
We have to study.

232
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,957
Hey, carry that rascal.

233
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,957
We will thrash him first
after going to the room.

234
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,457
Thanks, boss.
Last night l was fully drunk.

235
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,832
Had you not come on time
then they would have thrashed us.

236
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,082
ls it him?

237
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,957
How do they know?
They have boozed drunk than you.

238
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,457
Well, dude.
How come you stay relax forgetting..

239
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,249
..there will be a counter
attack after you attack someone.

240
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,749
Boys, at least you should be alert.

241
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,374
We are with him only to booze.

242
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,207
Shut up.

243
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,249
We have found the guys
who tried to attack brother.

244
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,165
We will thrash them.

245
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,499
You will spoil his name
with such useless ideas.

246
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,874
They will live in fear
thinking when Poorna..

247
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,457
..is going to attack us.

248
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,540
They should fear you thinking Poorna..

249
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,790
..might attack them anytime.

250
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,165
How come they attack you in return?

251
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,915
You should try something new, dude.

252
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:07,957
Have you joined recently?

253
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,082
Yes. l still didn't
get admission in the hostel.

254
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:12,915
Okay. Come to my room.

255
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,832
Come.

256
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,249
Close the doors.
Don't open them for anyone.

257
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,790
Where is she?

258
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,624
Our house is so big. Why is
she cutting her nails sitting here?

259
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,749
Go inside!

260
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,915
My goodness! They have come. Go!

261
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,165
Go! Go!

262
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,707

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,290
Hi, sir.

266
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,457
Earlier l was Veerapratap.

267
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,957
After their coming,
l have removed Veera.

268
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,207
Watch there.
l have removed it from name plate too.

269
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,582
Okay. Stop your nuisance
and come upstairs with tea.

270
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,207
Tea? l am going to bank.

271
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,624
Brother-in-law,

272
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,749

You will give coffee.

276
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,415
You will give food.

277
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,624
They will not eat.

278
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:20,457
They will eat only if l give them.
You go inside.

279
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,582
Go inside.

280
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,082
Go! Go inside!

281
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,124
We will sleep in the bedroom.
You sleep in the hall.

282
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,165
We booze and sleep anywhere.
Why do we need bedroom?

283

288
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,499
He has come with luggage.

289
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:49,790
Extra rent 5000 and meals 2000.

290
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,040
Why extra?
Are we not staying in the same room?

291
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:55,207
lf a flight is going empty
and if you wish to travel in it..

292
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,874
..then you will be
charged for seat, right?

293
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,165
This is also the same.

294
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,374
Hey, Pratap.

Will you stay here only?

299
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,707
Happy birthday, Poorna.

300
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,957
Go away! You!

301
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,290

Go away!

310
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:02,165
What is this?
There are beating me here too.

311
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,915
Sir, you are the house owner?
Why are you afraid of him?

312
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,332
What should l tell you, boy?

313
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,832
l was like that in the beginning.

314
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,665
That has brought me to this condition.

315
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,124
Hey, Poori!

316
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:14,915

00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:16,874
Cigarette stub.

318
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,832
How did it come here?

319
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,707
l have smoked it in the
morning and then threw it here.

320
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,957
You threw it here after
smoking it in the morning.

321
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:27,832
Whose house is this?

322
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,665
SBl manager Veerapratap's house.

323
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,457
Do you know Veerapratap?
Do you know him?

324
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:38,999
Hey, if l see cigarette
stub here again then..

Did you say all that?

334
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,082
Yes, my dear. Yes.

335
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:12,749
Will bachelors drink
lemon juice instead of beer?

336
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,957
They are paying rent every month.

337
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,415
What have you go to do?
Why can't you keep quiet?

338
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,374
l didn't stop there.
l went ahead. Watch again.

339
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:28,040

Okay. Do something.

My wife and sister-in-law are inside.
You go. l will sit here.

344
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,207
Useless fellow!

345
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,374
Hey, listen!
Why are you leaving when l am talking?

346
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,665
What is it? Why are you not listening
to me when l am talking to you?

347
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,415
What is the time?

00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,499
That's it, boy.

00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:55,124
He started off. l gave up.

351
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,915
By the way,
what have l got to do with him?

352
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,040
Will everyone come home at 5pm and..

353
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,249
..take bath and watch news at 7pm?

354
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,999
lt is his time and his wish. He
will come whenever he wishes to come.

355
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,790
Why should l interfere in between?

356
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,540
l cannot tolerate this anymore.

357
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:10,665
Take it easy, sir. l will tackle him.

358
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,082
Don't know what you will do.

359
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,124
Love with birthday boy?

360
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,624
Do you want to dance with him?

361
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,082
Get ready.

l thought everyone will
come to wish you on your birthday.

363
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,332
But nobody is coming near you.

364
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,415
Everyone fears our brother.

365
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,290
Dude, everyone should
come to you on your birthday.

366
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,290
They shouldn't stay
away from you like this.

367
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,374
Anyway, why are you always
interested in gangs and fights?

368
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:38,332
Don't you have anything else to do?

369
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:40,790
What else is more interesting
than gangs and fights at this age.

370
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,082
Girls.

371
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,874
Try them. They are magic.

372
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,707

..when you have convinced
your mother so much?

417
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,457
l will definitely stay in your house.
Very good.

418
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:15,540
Very good.

419
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,290
Everything will be alright.

Dude, it seems they have

Nice to meet you, sir.

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,707
He lives in foreign.

470
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,582
Let us go inside.

471
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,999
Hi, mother.

472
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,374
Hey, son.
Did you remember your house now?

473
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,582
Why are you behind
studies all the time?

474
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,957
He is my friend Jai.

475
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:08,499
Hi, aunt.

476
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:11,874
lt has been long time since
l saw a complete Telugu culture.

477
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:14,790
Take him to the room.

478
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,082

482
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,665
My aunt.

483
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,040
Aunt?
- Yes.

484
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:29,290
This is injustice. You should
increase your age little bit.

485
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,749
Otherwise it will be difficult.

486
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:33,665
My uncle.

487
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,707
Hello, sir.

488
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:39,707
Brother!

489
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:41,540
Manasa? When did you come?

490
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:42,999
l came one week back.

491
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,124
What is this dress and style?

492
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,957
My friend Jai.

493
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,957
My sister Manasa.
My elder uncle's daughter.

494
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:04,707
Hi.

495
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,457
What's up?

496
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,499
He is the reason behind my change?

497
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,374
Come.

498
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:25,457
Uncle, he is my friend Jai.

499
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,707
Hi.

500
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:31,540
This is a village. Behave like them.

501
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,082
Sorry, dude.

502
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,124
Come here.

503
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,624
Be careful with my
father and brother. Okay?

504
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:54,582
Jai.

505
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:01,957
l felt very sad thinking
you went far away from me.

506
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,582
But l didn't think that
you will come so close to me.

507
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:07,290
Manasa, every person
has only one life.

508
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,624
l don't believe there is another life.

509
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:12,582
lt is not correct if we
don't stay happy in this life.

510
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,832
l want to see you happy.

511
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,957
You look good when you are happy.

512
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,999
lt is not easy to change this house.
Not as easy as you changed my brother.

513
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,582
They are human beings, right?

514
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,832
Manasa, human beings change.
Let us try.

515
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:33,540
They have laid a trap and
kidnapped them before killing.

516
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:40,499
Henceforth l should know
each and every move of Uma.

517
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:44,999
l should sacrifice his head
to goddess Poleramma this time!

518
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:51,832
Greetings.

519
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:55,374
Good evening, sir.

520
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:58,624
What, Pratapam?
What are you doing till night?

521
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:00,915
Not Pratapam, sir. lt is Pratap.

522
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:03,624
l had some urgent work in bank.
Therefore l got late.

523
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,540
Anyways thanks for your affection.

524
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,874
Not affection.
lf the neighbouring villagers..

525
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:11,457
..know that you belong to this family,
they will chase and kill you.

526
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,290
Nice, relationships, sir.

527
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:16,040
Greetings, madam.

528
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,915
Go and change your clothes.
After that come and eat food.

529
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:20,249
My goodness.

530
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,957
Okay. Bye.

531
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:26,915
Dude, you should find

532
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:28,665
..tell my love matter to my family.

533
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,082
Please.

534
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:31,957
You fell in love just now.

535
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,415
Enjoy few days, dude.

536
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,665
Okay.

537
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:36,290
Greetings, boy.

538
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:38,749
Sir! How are you?

539
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,082
lt seems you have settled
well in the house.

540
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,415
l have settled down very well.

541
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,415
Veerapratap liked
our house very much and..

542
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,540
..said he will stay here for one year.

543
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,207
Carry on, sir. Why do you worry?

544
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:50,957
One minute. Hi, darling.

545
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:51,999
Darling?

546
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,040
l had some work..

547
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,124
Hello, Mr. Pratap. How is it here?

548
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,790
How is it?

549
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,207
lt is like getting transferred
to hell after paying one lakh.

550
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:01,999
What is it, sir?
- What do you ask like that?

551
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:07,665
Village should wake
up to cock-a-doodle-doo.

552
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,540
Every house in the village
follows some tradition.

553
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,540
Villages have a pleasant ambience.

554
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,957
There isn't anything like that here.
- There is nothing.

555
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,582
lnstead of that, l get to hear words
like killing revenge and burying.

556
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:23,665
l am missing my home.
l cannot stay here.

557
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,582
Homesick.

558
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:26,957
Why are you staying here, sir?
Why don't you go?

559
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,999
l tried that too.

560
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:34,749
Once l didn't like this
place and went to bank quarters.

561
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,624
They held my collar and beat me.

562
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:38,832
Finally they brought me here.

563
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,874
l asked the reason for beating me.

564
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,665
They said it is love.
Hell with their love.

565
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,749
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

566
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:49,832
What is it?

567
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:51,415
Sir, she is my daughter. Padma.

568
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,624
She stood first in district
in lntermediate exams.

569
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,540
She says she wants to study further.

570
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,290
l went to the newly
built engineering college.

571
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,582
They are asking for fees.

572
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,999
lf you can have a word with them..

573
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,540
Didn't l tell you
not to get her educated?

574
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,374
You will not listen to me.

575
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,999
ls it wrong to work like you?

576
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:10,499
First think about your status.
Today you will get her educated.

577
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,457
And in future you have to search
for a suitable marriage proposal.

578
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:14,957
Enough of your education.

579
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,040
Come to work with your
mother from tomorrow.

580
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,290
Go!

581
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,832
Everyone is strange in your house.

582
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,457
Will not they talk
with love and affection?

583
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:26,582
What are you watching? Go!

584
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:32,249
Do you wish to change
them like you did to me?

585
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,207
Girl is the reason for my
giving up on fights and hooliganism.

586
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,040
But they don't have any reason.

587
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,499
Come.

588
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:46,915
Life is beautiful, dude.

589
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,665
Why did Fatima come?

590
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:55,665
Brother, maybe she is need of money.

591
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,124
Why did you come? How are you?

592
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:03,957
ln spite of saying no, my
husband trusted you and your family.

593
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:06,040
He got involved in fights.

594
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,124
He lost his life in it.

595
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:11,957
l didn't come to ask
for help because he died.

596
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:17,499
l have got only one son.
He is barely 16 years old.

597
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:21,999
He toojoined you and he
says he will kill the people..

598
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,915
..who killed his father.

599
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,707
Sir, he doesn't care for my words.

600
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:31,915
At least you tell him
to leave all this and send him.

601
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:36,165
He is a man. A man is born to a man.

602
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,082
He will stay here only. You go.

603
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:39,874
What if he too dies?

604
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,957
lf my work is to give
you men to work under you..

605
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,082
..then l don't have any
man to have children with.

606
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:55,457
Go!

607
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,540
He will work here only!

608
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,249
He will kill his father's killers!

609
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,707
lf the wife of a person
working under me interferes..

610
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,665
..then l will not spare her too.

611
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,999
l will hang them to death. Go!

612
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,874
Poorna! Poorna!

613
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:22,790
Where is your brother?

614
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,540
He is somewhere around
talking over the phone.

615
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,457
l am observing him since his arrival.

616
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,832
He is talking over
the phone continuously.

617
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:30,249
Where is brother Jai?

618
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,582
l thought only men beat women here.

619
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:34,957
Will women too beat men?

620
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:36,874
Notjust beating. l should kill.

621
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:39,165
What brother Jai? Did l say brother?

622
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,707
Doesn't brother's
friend become brother?

623
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,040
ls it written in constitution?

624
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,457
Why will they write in constitution?

625
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,040
Generally everyone feels so.
That's why l too felt so.

626
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,332
Why to discuss constitution now?

627
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:56,457
lf it is like this
then forget that girl..

628
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:58,915
..you will never become
brother to any girl in this state.

629
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:01,540
We cannot live in this house.

630
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:04,374
Women are beating men.
Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!

631
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,457
Don't know what medicine
you gave him and changed him.

632
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,457
You better change
everyone in this house.

633
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,082
lt is not so easy, sir.

634
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:14,040
l have thrown your
sister-in-law as bait to him.

635
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,499
Not possible to do it with..

636
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:21,415
Threw her as bait?
ls she a fish to use her like that?

637
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,707
lt is not that, sir.
He and your sister-in-law are in love.

638
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,374
My sister-in-law and this guy in love?
- Yes, sir.

639
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:37,374
Oh! How well you are enjoying?
Hell with it!

640
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,665
l hope they don't kill
me if they find out..

641
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,915
..that he loves my
sister-in-law. Really?

642
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:41,915
Sir, l am there.

643
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:44,957
l am living here by
pinning all my hopes on you.

644
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,540
Homesick. Homesick.

645
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:47,915
Madam! Madam!

646
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:51,040
Fatima consumed
pesticide in the fields.

647
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,457
She is lying in hospital.

648
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:57,540
l told her many times to
give up her hopes on her son.

649
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:00,040
She didn't listen to me. Her fate.

650
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:13,957
Let us go to hospital. Come.

651
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,790
Brother,
l too will come this time when..

652
00:43:21,875 --> 00:43:23,540
..you go to kill the people
from neighbouring village.

653
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:26,915
Be careful. They will fall down.

654
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,415
Bring them here.

655
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,582
Come.

656
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,957
Where?

657
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,415
He will not come.

658
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:04,999
His mother consumed
pesticide and is in hospital.

659
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:13,249
Brother, nothing happened
to my mother, right?

660
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,499
She is alive, isn't?

661
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:19,165
Tell her that you will live
for her and not for your dead father.

662
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:21,624
She will stay alive.

663
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:37,915
Mother!

664
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:42,790
Mother! Will you
die leaving me behind?

665
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:47,332
No, mother.
Henceforth, l will listen to you.

666
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,790
l will not go to them and their house.

667
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:53,540
Believe me, mother.

668
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:56,999
Brother!

669
00:44:57,083 --> 00:44:58,582
Brother, at least you tell her,

670
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:01,290
Tell her that l will
stay with my mother and study.

671
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:06,874
Mother, henceforth
he will listen to you.

672
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,915
Go to some place and get
him educated and live happily.

673
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,665
No, son.

674
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,249
l am not doing this favour.

675
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,832
The head of that family
told me to give you.

676
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,290
Mother..

677
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,832
Darling, it has been
many days since l saw you.

678
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:38,499
l am longing to see you.

679
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:44,165
Nothing, son. There is
only one cell phone in my house.

680
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,540
l am feeling homesick
and l want to speak to my wife.

681
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:49,665
But the phone is busy since two days.

682
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,749
By the way, what is he
talking with my sister-in-law?

683
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,832
Sir, he is in love. Let him talk.

684
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,582
You go and ask for the phone.
He will give it. - Okay.

685
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:00,582
Nothing, son. Homesick.

686
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:04,624
l wish to become the
pillow in your hands..

687
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:07,332
..and hug you tightly.

688
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:15,665
What?
One minute, darling.

689
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:19,832
lt has been many days
since l spoke to my wife.

690
00:46:19,916 --> 00:46:21,207
l am feeling homesick.

691
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:23,249
Can l talk once?

692
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:25,874
Brother is asking
how are you both doing.

693
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:29,082
What is wrong with him?
He is excellent.

694
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:31,749
They are fine she says.
Do you want anything else?

695
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,540
Okay. l told him as you said.

696
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:36,332
You told them that l am fine, right.

697
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:37,915
Brother too says he is fine.

698
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:39,040
l told her. Okay.

699
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:41,332
So there is no need for me to talk,
isn't it?

700
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,415
Okay. Okay.

701
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:48,874
Sir!

702
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:01,707
What?

703
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:05,999
Sir, l thought this house
doesn't care for others.

704
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:09,624
But l never thought they
will understand others feelings too.

705
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:13,124
My husband died because
of this family and..

706
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,665
..therefore l never
wanted you to prosper.

707
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,207
But l was wrong.

708
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:22,665
By looking at the support
given by your family..

709
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:25,915
...l feel that you
should live a long life.

710
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:36,082
Sir, you have helped
me to provide him a good life.

711
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:40,832
l will make him a good
human being and bring him to you.

712
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,082
This life belongs to you.

713
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:49,040
Sir, wherever we might go,
we will remember you..

714
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,665
..and your favours.

715
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,957
l thought of living
for my deceased father.

716
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,874
But what if my mother
who is alive dies.

717
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:05,832
Then what is the use
of this life, brother.

718
00:48:22,416 --> 00:48:25,332
For the first time l have
heard someone talking good..

719
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:29,290
.. about this family.

720
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:32,790
l know you are the reason behind it.

721
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:38,207
Why did you tell our name
when you have helped them?

722
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,249
Sir, they are your people.

723
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:44,082
They are living by trusting you.

724
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,707
Sir, if a stranger
like me helps them then..

725
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:50,957
..they will not care for it.

726
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,957
But if you do the same
thing then people think..

727
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:56,374
..that the family they
trusted had stood by them.

728
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,624
Sir, do you know why
the villagers come to you..

729
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:01,790
..whenever they face any problem?

730
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,749
lt is not because this family is rich.

731
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:06,415
lt is because they think there
is an elder person in this family.

732
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:11,374
Sir, power doesn't
mean to control people.

733
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:14,957
lt is the happiness of helping people.

734
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:22,457
Sir, it is not our greatness
if there are people who are..

735
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,499
..willing to give
up their lives for us.

736
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,249
Our greatness lies
in saving the people..

737
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:28,332
..who are ready to
give up their lives for us.

738
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:38,832
Hi, Jai.

739
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:40,124
Hey!

740
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:45,665
Jai, today l am very happy.
Everything is new.

741
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:48,540
l will ask you something openly.

742
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:50,415
Tell me frankly.

743
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:53,457
By the way,
why did you come to my house?

744
00:49:57,416 --> 00:50:01,957
lt is.. lt is.. l have come
to see this village and its beauty.

745
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:07,374
Okay. l will show you the village.
Watch it there. Beauty.

746
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,207
l think this is the first
time you came to a village.

747
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:17,040
Wow! Superb location.

748
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:22,290
How nice it will be if you..

749
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:26,957
..could watch this beauty
without blinking your eyes.

750
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,290
Watch here.
Look how beautiful it looks.

751
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,332
Those fields.

752
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,165
Those fields..
l thought something else..

753
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:58,082
Look at the area in between.

754
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:00,499
How beautiful it looks
as if it is sculptured.

755
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:06,874
l am talking about that area.

756
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:09,332
Yes. Perfect. Perfect.

757
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:14,999
Look here..
Look how beautiful and pleasing it is.

758
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:20,874
lt will look more beautiful
if we do something to it.

759
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:25,290
l mean it will be better
if we irrigate the land.

760
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,665
lrrigate.. Land..

761
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,999
lf you could watch with
interest and patience..

762
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:37,374
..then there is more beauty.

763
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:39,249
You will watch, right?

764
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,957
Sir..

765
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:12,082
Sit inside.

766
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:29,749
Why will it not be outstanding
if you do a follow up?

767
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:31,624
l will see to it, sir.

768
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,457
Sir..

769
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:39,040
Why did you come here, sir?

770
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:40,915
Had you informed me then
l would have come on my own.

771
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,790
She is our girl.

772
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:46,749
l told her many times not to study.

773
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:50,915
She didn't listen to me.
She stood first in the district.

774
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:59,707
She will do well in her life
if she studies in your college.

775
00:52:59,791 --> 00:53:01,707
You too will get good name.

776
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:05,707
Sir, all the free seats are filled.
Only payment seats are left.

777
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:08,707
Money? Not that l cannot pay.

778
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:10,957
lf l pay then only l will become good.

779
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:15,915
But you too should become good.
Give her seat..

780
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:19,832
Sir, if l keep giving like
this then l cannot run my business.

781
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:21,332
Are you doing business with education?

782
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:24,165
Open a liquor shop. lt will be good.

783
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:31,124
She will come to
college from tomorrow.

784
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,707
Many villagers will show interest
in studies after seeing her.

785
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:37,707
l shouldn't come here for them.

786
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:44,207
Look, you should study
well and become like him.

787
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:45,707
Sir..

788
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,707
l have brought a marriage
proposal for Manasa.

789
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:15,415
The boy is from Jammalamadugu.

790
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,582
Boy's family is coming
tomorrow to see her.

791
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,582
What marriage?

792
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:25,832
Are you mad?

793
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:27,957
Anybody will feel happy for marriage.

794
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,415
Why are you creating nuisance?

795
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,332
Whom did you ask before fixing it?

796
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:35,707
l will not even see his face.

797
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,790
You should have told
me something about it.

798
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,040
l too don't know.

799
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,540
Your uncle has brought
this proposal all of a sudden.

800
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:48,290
Jai.

801
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:54,457
My uncle has brought
a marriage proposal for me.

802
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,457
l know.

803
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:59,374
What is it, Jai? Do something.

804
00:54:59,833 --> 00:55:02,415
Boy's family is coming to see you.
Not to marry you.

805
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,915
Just pass your time
with it for one day.

806
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:10,082
l will take care of it later. Cool.

807
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:28,499
Hello.
- Come. Sit down.

808
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:31,624
My uncle. Your to-be father-in-law.

809
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:33,915
Veerasimhudu.
You must have heard my name.

810
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:37,124
l killed six people
alone in Jammalamadugu.

811
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:44,415
Hey, Pratapam.

812
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,082
Where are you going?

813
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,165
Sir, it is not Pratapam. lt is Pratap.

814
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,457
l am going to bank.

815
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:52,040
There is a function
in our house. Come.

816
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:55,832
He is Veerasimhudu.
He has come to see my daughter.

817
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:58,874
Greetings, sir.
Why did you come with friends?

818
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:00,082
Why didn't you bring your parents?

819
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:01,957
lf the entire family comes out
together then enemy will attack us.

820
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:03,082
That's why we don't go out together.

821
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:04,790
Oh! Nice scheme.

822
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:06,249
ls the girl still getting ready?

823
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,540
lt is enough. Tell her to come.

824
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:10,290
lf l stay for long at one
place then it is dangerous to me.

825
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,707
l like the girl. What is the name?

826
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:24,665
Manasa.

827
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,040
Name too is good.
My name is Veerasimhudu.

828
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:29,290
Will you give coffee
or something with your hands?

829
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:32,499
He is asking for coffee. Give it.

830
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:35,749
l am able to see the pride of Palnadu.
l like you again.

831
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:44,415
What did you study?
Did you at least pass 10th standard?

832
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,624
l studied MS in foreign.

833
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:47,790
So you didn't pass even 10th standard?

834
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:52,999
Which place are you coming from?
- Jammalamadugu.

835
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:55,624
How many Sumos have you brought?

836
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:56,707
Two.

837
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:57,999
Oh.

838
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,874
What are your travelling expenses?

839
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,165
lt is 10,000.

840
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,874
Food expenses will
be around 5,000, right?

841
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,082
Yes.

842
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:05,915
Altogether it is 15,000.

843
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:11,082
l like the girl.
Talk to parents and fix the marriage.

844
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:14,207
15,000 for coming here and
15,000 for going back are wasted.

845
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,999
Greetings.

846
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:22,832
He liked me? Yuck!

847
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,874
Does that rascal have a choice too?

848
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:29,499
Mother, how did you
think of him as groom?

849
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:32,957
Dear, l convinced everyone
when you wanted to study.

850
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,040
But l don't have the right
to find a boy of your choice.

851
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,499
Boy is good, isn't?

852
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:40,624
He is tall. Thick moustache.

853
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,207
lf he is good then you marry him.

854
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:44,915
Madam, it will not look
good if she marries at this age.

855
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:46,874
Hello.

856
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:51,249
Hello. Hello.
Hello.

857
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,915
Did you like the boy?

858
00:57:53,458 --> 00:57:55,332
At least you tell her.
What is wrong with that boy?

859
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:58,124
He is perfect.
Only his name is not good.

860
00:57:59,125 --> 00:57:59,999
Name?

861
00:58:00,083 --> 00:58:01,874
What is Veerasimhudu? Wild name.

862
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:04,249
Sambashivudu or Sadashivudu
would have been good.

863
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,165
According to his name,
he travels in Sumo and..

864
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,957
..wears white clothes. Also glares.

865
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,957
Okay. No problem. We will agree.

866
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,790
But watching the people around him..

867
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,082
..l think the boy's enemies
are following him badly.

868
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:22,499
Since the boy is bachelor now,
he will be surrounded..

869
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,832
..by those goons all the time.

870
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,582
After marriage, she will be with him.

871
00:58:25,666 --> 00:58:28,415
What if enemies attack
him after finding a right time?

872
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,790
What will be the situation?

873
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:31,082
He will die.

874
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:32,790
lt is okay if he dies.
lt is okay if he dies.

875
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:35,624
We will cry for a week and
forget thinking it is her fate.

876
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,582
But it will be a problem
if he stays alive after..

877
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:41,832
..losing his hands and legs.

878
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:49,499
Your daughter too should
serve him all her life..

879
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:51,957
..by making him sit in a chair.

880
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,999
Except this there is
nothing wrong with that boy.

881
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:59,124
Nothing wrong. Nothing.

882
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,957
Next month is auspicious.
Priest has told us.

883
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:16,832
l don't like Manasa marrying that boy.

884
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:25,999
She is educated.
She cannot live with such boy.

885
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:30,915
lt is fine even if the
boy is uneducated and a famer.

886
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:36,999
But no need of a boy who
goes around surrounded by goons.

887
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:38,499
She is your daughter.

888
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:41,332
l will not agree with the
proposal that you don't like.

889
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,332
We will find a good match.

890
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:05,832
What is happening here?
Do you know that girl before?

891
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,374
Don't tell anyone.
l know her from abroad.

892
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,707
Did you come for the girl?

893
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:14,832
Something like that..

894
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:18,124
Did you befriend her brother
and come to this house..

895
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:19,832
..for the girl?

896
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:21,874
Sir, you got it well.

897
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:25,249
You are using everyone very nicely.

898
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,832
You are not sparing anyone.

899
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,040
You are not sparing
even the person who is lame.

900
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:33,624
Wow! You are using everyone well.

901
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:37,957
lf you want then use me too.

902
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,624
l have already used you.

903
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:45,040
He is using you.
He is using everyone nicely.

904
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:47,415
You are unable to
understand it. Fools.

905
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:49,207
lt is okay.

906
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:01,957
"He is a handsome
guy and six feet tall."

907
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,999
"He turned me crazy."

908
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:13,499
"By looking into my eyes,
he intoxicated me."

909
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:34,624
"Hello, Senorita. Hello, Senorita."

910
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:37,874
"You are my horlicks and bournvita."

911
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:41,040
"l am Margareta. l am Margareta."

912
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:44,249
"You are yet to see my beauty."

913
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,499
"Your beauty is hidden
inside your eyes."

914
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:50,707
"Your charm lies in your heart."

915
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:54,290
"l will turn your crazy, dear."

916
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,540
"Barbie girl! Baby doll!"

917
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:02,874
"My heart is beating fast."

918
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,915
"Barbie girl! Baby doll!"

919
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:09,457
"My heart is beating fast."

920
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:25,915
"Hello, Senorita. Hello, Senorita."

921
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:29,040
"You are my horlicks and bournvita."

01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:32,290
"l am Margareta. l am Margareta."

923
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:35,749
"You are yet to see my beauty."

924
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:51,207
"Don't touch me so hard."

925
01:02:51,291 --> 01:02:57,499
"Don't kiss me sweetly.
Please don't do that."

926
01:02:57,583 --> 01:03:00,832
"Don't hurt my lips."

927
01:03:00,916 --> 01:03:04,290
"Your body is mesmerising."

928
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:07,499
"You are an epitome of beauty."

929
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,540
"Girl looks yummy like a chocolate."

930
01:03:10,625 --> 01:03:13,290
"Taste it, dear."

931
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:16,499
"Barbie girl! Baby doll!"

932
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:19,665
"My heart is beating fast."

933
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,707
"Barbie girl! Baby doll!"

934
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:26,374
"My heart is beating fast."

935
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:55,124
"l will help you

"l will make your realize

01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:04,624
"l will jump like a storm."

939
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:08,207
"Don't know whether
you hijack or kidnap me."

940
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:11,582
"Show me your speed in air."

941
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:17,249
"You will faint after
my watching my romance."

942
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:20,082
"Barbie girl! Baby doll!"

943
01:04:20,458 --> 01:04:23,499
"My heart is beating fast."

944
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:26,832
"Barbie girl! Baby doll!"

945
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:30,165
"My heart is beating fast."

946
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:03,165
Brother, tyre is punctured.

947
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:07,957
Hey, fix it.

948
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,415
Okay, brother.

949
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:14,874
Greetings, brother.
- Are you going to the village?

950
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:16,332
Yes, brother.

951
01:05:26,458 --> 01:05:29,415
They are coming! Go!

952
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,790
Go! Go!

953
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:38,999
You are finished!

954
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:47,582
He is saved! Rascal!

955
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:50,832
What are you doing here?

956
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:52,832
l went to city for hair cut.

957
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:56,707
Just miss, dude.

958
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:58,707
What will happen if you get caught?

959
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,415
So the next attack is ours.

960
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:09,165
Nobody will stay alive from them.

961
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,915
l have an idea.

962
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:14,790
They will be alert all
the time thinking that..

963
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:16,499
..you will attack them any time.

964
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:19,040
So what if we don't attack
them for 50, 60 years.

965
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,499
They will live in fear, right?

966
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:24,082
How is the idea? lt is superb, right?

967
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:39,249
This.. Will it rotate all the time?

968
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,832
lt will stop only when we stop it.

969
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:42,832
For food.

970
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:46,999
Even the motor in the fields
is given rest at regular intervals.

971
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:49,124
You are thrown inside
the kitchen and..

972
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:50,540
..are made to work round the year.

973
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,082
l didn't like this at all.

974
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:56,124
Rest? You have seen
the members of this family.

975
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:59,707
We have to cook in huge
quantities to feed them.

976
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:02,915
So will you stay inside
like this all your life.

977
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,957
You wake up and prepare breakfast.

978
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:10,915
And then you think of
what to prepare for lunch.

979
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:13,082
Okay. You prepare good lunch.

980
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:15,040
After lunch, you will discuss
whether to prepare fritters..

981
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,790
..or something else for snacks.

982
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,582
Once it is over,
you get ready to prepare dinner.

983
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:22,332
Next day you wake up
and think the same again.

984
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:24,874
What is this life?

985
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:26,790
lf you go back ten
years and think then..

986
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,457
..you will not find anything
other than vegetables..

987
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:30,082
..lemon rice and upma
(south lndian breakfast).

988
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:32,165
What else can we do other than that?

989
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:36,165
You have to lock this
kitchen for one month.

990
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,915
Your idea is to order food
from Mastan's hotel, right?

991
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:41,749
Did you understand like that?

992
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:45,540
Let us go out for a
week on holiday and enjoy.

993
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,915
Holiday? Superb!

994
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:51,957
Outside? Why did you
ask as if it is to moon?

995
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,415
Son, we went to Tirupati
temple when l was newly married.

996
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,915
That's it.

997
01:08:56,958 --> 01:09:02,582
l went to 'Prema Pavuram'
movie in 1990. That's it.

998
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:04,915
My goodness!
lt will be like going abroad..

999
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,249
..if they go out of the district.

1000
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:07,915
Mother, let us go.

1001
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:12,207
Aunt! Aunt! Let us please go, aunt.

1002
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:13,374
Please! Please! Please!

1003
01:09:13,458 --> 01:09:14,915
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1004
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,165
Okay, go and ask your
father and uncle. Go.

1005
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:24,457
Mr. Pratap, Jai is taking
all of us on a holiday for a week.

1006
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:26,082
You too can come.

1007
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:33,457
Mad woman! You don't know.
He is using all of you.

1008
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:44,082
You must be tired of sitting
like this for 20 years.

1009
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:50,124
Sir, let us go and see
the outside world and enjoy.

1010
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:57,540
Brother, they have planned
everything discreetly..

1011
01:09:57,625 --> 01:09:58,874
..and then executed it.

1012
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:01,290
They tried to kill us. Rascals!

1013
01:10:02,958 --> 01:10:06,915
Uncle, everyone is bored of
staying in the house all the time.

1014
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:09,624
Uncle, let us go on a holiday.

1015
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:13,124
Let us go, uncle. Please.

1016
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:18,540
Not outside!

1017
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:20,040
You will die!

1018
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:23,874
lf anybody gets such mad thoughts..

1019
01:10:23,958 --> 01:10:25,915
..then l will kill everyone.

1020
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:28,332
Go!

1021
01:10:28,916 --> 01:10:30,374
Didn't l tell you to go?

1022
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,540
Go!

1023
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:43,290
We should kill our enemies right now.

1024
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:45,915
We should kill them all!

1025
01:11:05,791 --> 01:11:08,540
We are going to Srisailam temple.

1026
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:12,874
Younger brother will finish
the work after coming back.

1027
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:37,999
Deva's family left for Srisailam.

1028
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:40,457
His entire family should be dead.

1029
01:11:40,541 --> 01:11:42,540
Brother, the goons
from Bihar have laid trap..

1030
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:44,957
..at three places on their way.

1031
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:58,249
Don't show mercy
on women and children.

1032
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:03,665
You have to kill everyone!

1033
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:08,957
Brother, they cannot
escape from first place.

1034
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,082
You will hear their death
screams in another ten minutes.

1035
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,499
Start!

1036
01:13:55,791 --> 01:13:57,915
Nobody is lifting the call over there.

1037
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:59,124
What happened?

1038
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,874
Brother, it seems
their escaped from there.

1039
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:02,082
We have caught them.

1040
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:04,457
Their lives will be
dead in another two minutes.

1041
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:00,374
What is happening?

1042
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:09,957
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Are they caught?

1043
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:12,624
Tell me that Deva's family dead.

1044
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:19,749
Tell me!

1045
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:22,999
My family is safe!

1046
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:31,332
Brother!

1047
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:32,582
What happened?

1048
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:33,540
What happened, brother?

1049
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:45,082
"He will not spare anyone
who touches his family."

1050
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:51,457
"He has come to rescue his men!"

1051
01:16:57,833 --> 01:17:00,832
"He will not spare anyone
who touches his family."

1052
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:04,124
"He has come to rescue his men!"

1053
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:16,749
Didn't you say that
he is not in that family?

1054
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:18,874
Brother, don't know
from where he has come.

1055
01:17:27,791 --> 01:17:30,749
By god's grace we all are safe.

1056
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:36,415
No. lt is his grace.

1057
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:43,540
Nobody other than Jai
can save from those devils.

1058
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,707
Brother, l suspect that
he is living somewhere..

1059
01:17:47,791 --> 01:17:50,749
..in these surroundings for our sake.

1060
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:55,165
Brother-in-law,
l had never seen Manasa..

1061
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,040
..so happy like this anytime before.

1062
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:58,957
Jai is the reason
behind her happiness.

1063
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,999
lf we want her to remain
happy like this forever..

1064
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:03,124
..then we should
get her married to Jai.

1065
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:09,457
Dear, there is happiness
all around after Jai's arrival.

1066
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:14,290
What if we get Manasa married to him?

1067
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:17,832
Yes, father.

1068
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:21,540
We cannot find a better
boy than Jai for Manasa.

1069
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:23,749
Jai, l don't know who you are.

1070
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:29,499
l just said l am not happy,
you came till here..

1071
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:31,874
You made my life.

1072
01:18:34,416 --> 01:18:35,749
l love you.

1073
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:38,249
l love you, Jai.

1074
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:41,457
Manasa, l wanted to see you happy.

1075
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,499
Along with you, l wanted to see
many people living here to be happy.

1076
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:50,999
Do you know who l am?

1077
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:55,457
This family wants to kill
Deva from the neighbouring village.

1078
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,040
l am his son.

1079
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:06,165
Manasa, the Jai whom
you are seeing now..

1080
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,957
..is different from
the Jai of old days.

1081
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:09,915
His character is different.

1082
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,332
His world is different.

1083
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,499
All the flowers should be spread.

1084
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:25,165
Anita, it is dark over there.
See to it.

1085
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,749
Okay, madam.

1086
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:35,957
Ashok.
- Yes, madam.

1087
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,582
Check the arch at the entrance.

1088
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:38,707
Okay, madam.

1089
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,082
Madam, tulips flowers
haven't come yet.

1090
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:43,957
Okay. Jai will bring them.
- Okay, madam.

1091
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:49,957
How come you remain so irresponsible?

1092
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,290
Should l stop the function for you?

1093
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:53,332
Mother, roses and lilies
are found everywhere.

1094
01:19:53,416 --> 01:19:54,957
Tulips are difficult to find.

1095
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:56,624
Hey, don't tell these stories.

1096
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,540
Anita, keep these tulips there.
- Okay, madam.

1097
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:00,665
Hi, Jai!
- Hi.

1098
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,332
Hi.
- Hi, Jai! - Hi, girls.

1099
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:04,499
lt has been many days since l saw you.

1100
01:20:04,583 --> 01:20:05,707
Madam.
- Yes.

1101
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:07,874
Watch the flies around jaggery.

1102
01:20:09,416 --> 01:20:11,249
Construction site is really good.

1103
01:20:11,333 --> 01:20:12,915
Jai, come here.

1104
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:16,999
l am afraid to bring you
to these kinds offunctions.

1105
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:18,082
Mother, please leave my hand.

1106
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:20,415
l have to protect you like a girl.

1107
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,415
Mother, l am not a kid.

1108
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:31,790
Mother, bridegroom's
father is over reacting.

1109
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:33,082
Keep quiet.

1110
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:38,082
l am safe. l don't have
anyone like him to do all this.

1111
01:20:46,916 --> 01:20:50,082
'l am safe. l don't have
anyone like him to do all this.'

1112
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:54,332
Mother, are you okay?

1113
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,957
l have committed a mistake.

1114
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:08,790
l have committed a mistake
by not telling you that..

1115
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:14,040
..you have a father and he lives here.

1116
01:21:15,583 --> 01:21:19,249
When you were two year old,
your father and l were living..

1117
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,082
..in Mumbai.

1118
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:27,082
We all went to your father's
village during a festival.

1119
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:49,707
Till then the people from
those two villages killed each other.

1120
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:52,082
That region turned into a hell.

1121
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:57,207
Your grandfather was killed
brutally in front of us.

1122
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:15,582
Sir, only one is caught by us.

1123
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:17,374
Rest have escaped.

1124
01:22:17,458 --> 01:22:19,249
Sir, even if one is alive
from that family then..

1125
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:20,957
..it will be dangerous for us.

1126
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:23,957
We can live only if we kill all men.

1127
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:25,707
Lift the sword, sir.

1128
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:29,249
lt is my father who has died.

1129
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,665
Why are you seeking revenge?

1130
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:36,332
We will kill them
and they will kill us.

1131
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,624
What will remain in the end?

1132
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:43,957
lt will turn into a graveyard
without any trace of humans.

1133
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:46,957
They cannot think like us.

1134
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:50,040
We should change our thinking.

1135
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,957
Sir, we are living by
trusting you and your family.

1136
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:54,249
What if something happens to you?

1137
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:58,415
Your wife and children
are living by trusting you.

1138
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:00,415
What if something happens to you?

1139
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,374
Henceforth if l come to
know that if you have attacked..

1140
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:10,832
..any person from that village
then the family that you love..

1141
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:15,915
Nobody will stay alive. Go.

1142
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:32,082
Deva.

1143
01:23:34,208 --> 01:23:35,582
Shall we start?

1144
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:36,915
Where?

1145
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:38,165
To our house?

1146
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:43,290
Latha, how can we go by
leaving everything like this?

1147
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:47,290
These people behave like animals.

1148
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:50,957
The moment l leave this place they
will turn this place into graveyard.

1149
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:54,582
l will stay here and hold them back.

1150
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:55,999
l have to change
them into human beings.

1151
01:23:56,083 --> 01:23:57,874
Deva, l am too afraid
of the same thing.

1152
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:01,874
These animals will hold onto you and..

1153
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:03,582
..make you take up the sword.

1154
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:08,207
Don't you trust me?

1155
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:10,707
l don't trust the people around you.

1156
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:12,874
l cannot leave this village and go.

1157
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:18,624
Deva, l too cannot live here.

1158
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,415
Deva, decide whether
you want this village..

1159
01:24:27,208 --> 01:24:28,415
..or me and your child.

1160
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:43,874
Sister-in-law says she wants to go.

1161
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:46,665
Take her carefully.

1162
01:24:54,750 --> 01:25:00,665
That day l left and went
far away from him and the village.

1163
01:25:02,041 --> 01:25:06,082
Because if something happens to him..

1164
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:08,540
..then l shouldn't get that news.

1165
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:13,999
He has left me for
the sake of villagers.

1166
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:19,999
l am sad for it but l haven't
seen a good person than him.

1167
01:25:22,916 --> 01:25:24,624
l want to see him once.

1168
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,957
We are getting you dressed
up well every time..

1169
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,415
..whenever a boy comes to see you.

1170
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,165
We don't understand when
your marriage will take place.

1171
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,499
Boy should be extremely
lucky to get a girl like me.

1172
01:25:58,583 --> 01:26:00,207
l say no to such things.

1173
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:05,249
Days and traditions have changed.

1174
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:07,249
Otherwise if l was given
a choice to find a boy..

1175
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:10,165
..of my choice then lot of
boys would have come to marry me.

1176
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,624
Few neighbouring villages
have come to know her mentality.

1177
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:15,874
Some boys didn't come even to see her.

1178
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:18,999
That is not called mental.
lt is called intelligence.

1179
01:26:19,083 --> 01:26:20,582
Sister, play.

1180
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:23,874
You go out. Go.

1181
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:26,749
l doubt whether she will marry or not.

1182
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:30,415
Aunt, how can l live without marrying?

1183
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:35,332
The thing is that l want
to marry a king like boy.

1184
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,040
Hey.
- What?

1185
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:43,332
Do l look like a king?
- You look like a thief.

1186
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:45,915
Tell me the truth.

1187
01:26:47,375 --> 01:26:49,249
From one angle you look like that.

1188
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:51,749
Enough. One angle is enough.

1189
01:26:51,833 --> 01:26:53,082
How is it possible from all angles?

1190
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:56,415
Hey, why are you so relaxed?

1191
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,624
Boy's family is coming to
see madam today. Do you know that?

1192
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:02,165
l know. lt will take place
in my house. She is my sister-in-law.

1193
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,832
Nobody will come to see her.

1194
01:27:03,916 --> 01:27:05,624
Even if any boy comes
then he will not like her.

1195
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:08,624
Finally they will think
of getting her married to me.

1196
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:12,499
She might remain single
but she will never marry you.

1197
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:15,665
l beg you, dear.

1198
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:20,040
Behave well and see that
this marriage proposal works out.

1199
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,207
Mother, l have
understood your problem.

1200
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:25,832
l too will visit the
temple and pray for..

1201
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:27,915
..this marriage proposal to succeed.

1202
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:35,207
What will happen
if anybody watches me?

1203
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:36,707
They will kill me.

1204
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:38,999
Leave it. You will become
martyr for sacrificing..

1205
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:41,082
..your life for the
sake of sister-in-law.

1206
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:44,374
And then l will name
my children after you.

1207
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:46,957
Oh! She is talking more.

1208
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,707
Hey, do you remember what
you should say to the boy's family?

1209
01:27:49,791 --> 01:27:52,082
Oh! You made me to
tell this to four boys.

1210
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,957
We love each other.
Nobody can separate us.

1211
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,290
That's it, right?
Why do you worry for it, Vennu?

1212
01:27:57,375 --> 01:28:00,749
Four marriage proposals didn't
believe that you and l are lovers.

1213
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:02,415
They came to our house.

1214
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,665
lt was very difficult
for me to stop them.

1215
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:06,999
Stop crying and stop that car.

1216
01:28:21,583 --> 01:28:22,999
Wait.

1217
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:25,915
How handsome he looks. Let us go home.

1218
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:28,665
We will say okay. Come on.

1219
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:31,874
Listen to me.
We cannot find such a boy again.

1220
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:33,415
Please..

1221
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:37,540
Boss, are you going to Deva's house?

1222
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:38,790
Yes.

1223
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:41,665
You are going to their
house to see this girl.

1224
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:43,915
But we both love each other.

1225
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:46,665
Don't kill our love
with your marriage proposal.

1226
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:47,957
Hey!

1227
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:53,624
lf you go back from here
then you will save our love.

1228
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:00,957
Are you going to Deva's house?

1229
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,249
Yes.

1230
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:04,832
You are going to see that girl

1231
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:06,665
Hello.

1232
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:09,540
By the way, we should see the girl
inside the house. What is it outside?

1233
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:12,082
They both love each other.

1234
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:14,582
lf you go back then
their love will succeed.

1235
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:16,040
They have come to say this.

1236
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:17,082
Oh! No!

1237
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:20,624
Well, the girl is beautiful.
lt is difficult to say no.

1238
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:23,124
But they are in love, boss.

1239
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:28,874
Happy?

1240
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:50,707
Who are you, son?

1241
01:29:51,875 --> 01:29:53,290
l am Deva's son.

1242
01:29:57,541 --> 01:29:58,707
Come.

1243
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:06,999
Sir.

1244
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:17,082
Who?

1245
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:19,957
Father.

1246
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:40,374
Our Jai.

1247
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:44,249
Did you remember us now?

1248
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:45,707
Didn't mother come?

1249
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,415
She had some work.
Therefore she couldn't come.

1250
01:30:57,541 --> 01:31:01,290
Vennu, why did he come to our house?

1251
01:31:02,708 --> 01:31:04,582
Jai, your uncle.

1252
01:31:05,708 --> 01:31:07,957
Everyone is gathered at one place.

1253
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,249
Do you think the matter is leaked?

1254
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:13,624
My goodness!
They will thrash me. l will escape.

1255
01:31:13,708 --> 01:31:15,290
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

1256
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:17,332
We have done everything together.

1257
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:19,249
We will go together.
- What did we do?

1258
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:21,124
You have spoiled your chances of
marriage. l was by your side. That's it.

1259
01:31:21,208 --> 01:31:22,749
Vennu, l will not come. Vennu..

1260
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:25,457
Hello.

1261
01:31:25,541 --> 01:31:27,707
How are you all?
- Greetings.

1262
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,749
Why are you watching like that?
Your elder brother-in-law.

1263
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:34,874
Your elder uncle's son.

1264
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:47,082
Jai.

1265
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:53,415
Didn't you sleep yet?

1266
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,957
l am not feeling sleepy.

1267
01:31:56,375 --> 01:31:59,874
How is your mother?
- She is fine.

1268
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:08,040
Daily one peg.

1269
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:11,832
This is my company since 20 years.

1270
01:32:12,666 --> 01:32:15,582
Will you have?
- No. No. No. No. l am fine.

1271
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,957
So what are you doing?

1272
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,207
l am an architect.

1273
01:32:36,791 --> 01:32:40,249
Okay, father.
lt is late. Good night. Bye.

1274
01:32:40,333 --> 01:32:43,040
Jai, will you sleep here?

1275
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:47,415
There could be
mosquitoes in that room.

1276
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,999
lt is okay. l will sleep upstairs.

1277
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:52,040
Good night.
- Good night.

1278
01:33:06,416 --> 01:33:07,874
You will fall.

1279
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:11,832
Has someone given coffee
to brother-in-law or not..

1280
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:14,874
Oh! So you are giving coffee
to everyone in the morning.

1281
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:17,415
New clothes?

1282
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:18,957
No. Torn clothes.

1283
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:21,832
Why don't you buy me two silk saris?

1284
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:23,040
Which one?

1285
01:33:23,125 --> 01:33:24,707
You come, brother-in-law.

1286
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:38,999
ls there any function
in the house today?

1287
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:41,707
Happy birthday, Jai.

1288
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:48,874
Thanks. Today is my birthday.
l have forgotten.

1289
01:33:59,625 --> 01:34:01,457
ls it your birthday today?

1290
01:34:01,541 --> 01:34:05,457
Since my childhood l have seen
celebrating this day as a big festival.

1291
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:23,957
My son.

1292
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:25,332
Greetings!

1293
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,374
"You have come like a festival."

1294
01:34:34,458 --> 01:34:39,040
"You have given us
light and strength."

1295
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:45,290
"You have come like a festival."

1296
01:34:45,375 --> 01:34:47,082
"You have given us light."

1297
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:50,290
"You have given us strength."

1298
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:52,624
"You have given us support."

1299
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:54,415
"You have given us shadow.

1300
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,624
"You stood by us."

1301
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:01,707
"Sir, you are our happiness.
You are ourjoy."

1302
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:04,957
"You are everything to us."

1303
01:35:05,416 --> 01:35:08,999
"Good times have come.
This is our good luck."

1304
01:35:09,083 --> 01:35:12,665
"Let us live like this forever."

1305
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:27,249
"We didn't sing lullabies
for you in your children."

1306
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:29,665
"We didn't play with you."

1307
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,790
"You have grown big."

1308
01:35:32,875 --> 01:35:38,040
"This land and our
lives have found hope."

1309
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:44,832
"Our lives should be
filled with your love."

1310
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:52,374
"We want to see our
children happy like you."

1311
01:35:52,958 --> 01:35:59,957
"Your father and we
have missed you a lot."

1312
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:07,040
"You have come searching
for us and stood by us."

1313
01:36:07,541 --> 01:36:09,332
"You have come like a festival."

1314
01:36:09,416 --> 01:36:14,249
"You have given us
light and strength."

1315
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:16,582
"You have given us support."

1316
01:36:16,666 --> 01:36:18,415
"You have given us shadow."

1317
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:22,415
"You have stood by us."

1318
01:36:58,666 --> 01:37:04,624
"All these years we
had tears in our eyes."

1319
01:37:05,958 --> 01:37:12,207
"We have seen the glow in your eyes
that is similar to your father's."

1320
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:16,874
"Don't know which god has sent you."

1321
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:19,540
"Our lives have found a new hope."

1322
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:27,040
"We will remain indebted
to you all our lives."

1323
01:37:27,916 --> 01:37:29,665
"You have come like a festival."

1324
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:34,707
"You have given us
light and strength."

1325
01:37:35,166 --> 01:37:36,957
"You have given us support."

1326
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:38,749
"You have given us shadow."

1327
01:37:38,833 --> 01:37:41,749
"You have stood by us."

1328
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,957
Should they give 1500
acres of land to you?

1329
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,915
lf you tell them once
then it will be done.

1330
01:38:04,958 --> 01:38:07,582
That's why we have come here.

1331
01:38:07,666 --> 01:38:09,207
lf you want then we will
give you your commission.

1332
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:11,332
Do you know with whom you are talking?

1333
01:38:11,416 --> 01:38:13,332
Do you know who has sent us?

1334
01:38:13,416 --> 01:38:14,707
Brother Uma.

1335
01:38:16,625 --> 01:38:20,582
lf you do as he says then he
will not seek revenge and kill you.

1336
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,999
lt is fine if revenge is given up.

1337
01:38:26,625 --> 01:38:29,457
But not at the cost
of poor man's life.

1338
01:38:30,041 --> 01:38:32,207
We will give them some money.

1339
01:38:32,958 --> 01:38:34,540
Some money?

1340
01:38:34,958 --> 01:38:38,499
Farmers don't know what
to do if you give them money,

1341
01:38:38,583 --> 01:38:40,749
They know only farming.

1342
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:46,874
You have come so far.
Drink butter milk and go.

1343
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:49,790
All these years you have
maintained a low profile.

1344
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:51,915
Why are you showing
arrogance suddenly?

1345
01:38:51,958 --> 01:38:54,957
lf we leave from here
with a negative reply..

1346
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,540
..then the entire
village will be destroyed

1347
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:01,165
What nonsense did you talk?
- Stop!

1348
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:02,707
l will kill you!

1349
01:39:05,666 --> 01:39:09,790
You said what you wanted to say.
Now you may leave.

1350
01:40:35,208 --> 01:40:39,040
600 families are living
by trusting one person.

1351
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:43,040
How did you believe
that you can threaten him..

1352
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:44,832
..by bringing six people?

1353
01:41:26,458 --> 01:41:32,207
Because of his good nature
you are leaving this village safely.

1354
01:41:33,958 --> 01:41:36,624
Forget the last 20 years.

1355
01:41:36,708 --> 01:41:38,707
Now his son has come.

1356
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:41,707
Go and tell that his son has come!

1357
01:41:48,333 --> 01:41:54,999
"Palnadu has come to
life upon your arrival."

1358
01:41:55,083 --> 01:42:02,874
"Will not the enemy live in fear now?"

1359
01:42:02,958 --> 01:42:06,582
"You have come like a festival."

1360
01:42:06,666 --> 01:42:10,332
"You are a ray of hope for us."

1361
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,915
For the last 20 years
l didn't say anything..

1362
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:15,249
..because of the respect
l have towards your father.

1363
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:18,457
We have been waiting
as who will come to..

1364
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:21,749
..challenge them
and teach them a lesson.

1365
01:42:23,208 --> 01:42:27,749
l didn't think that you
will come back and make us proud.

1366
01:42:32,625 --> 01:42:34,957
Brother Uma shouldn't
come to know this.

1367
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:37,124
Otherwise he will kill us.

1368
01:42:41,625 --> 01:42:43,540
Deva is not a coward
and useless person..

1369
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:45,707
..as we are thinking him to be like.

1370
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:48,665
lt seems he is ready to give
up his life or take others lives..

1371
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:50,957
..if anybody harms that village.

1372
01:42:59,166 --> 01:43:02,374
Brother-in-law,
you are brought up in a city.

1373
01:43:02,458 --> 01:43:04,457
You must not have seen a village.

1374
01:43:05,208 --> 01:43:07,332
Are you enjoying everything?

1375
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:11,832
Had mother too come then
it would have been a festival.

1376
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:21,457
There is only one option
if aunt has to come to uncle.

1377
01:43:21,541 --> 01:43:22,707
What?

1378
01:43:22,791 --> 01:43:23,832
Your marriage.

1379
01:43:24,666 --> 01:43:26,749
Do you have anyone?
- What?

1380
01:43:26,833 --> 01:43:28,582
l mean girlfriend.

1381
01:43:29,833 --> 01:43:34,082
l had one in college.
Maybe now she got married.

1382
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:37,999
lf that is your case
then l too have 10, 15 boys.

1383
01:43:40,208 --> 01:43:41,374
Sorry.

1384
01:43:42,208 --> 01:43:45,124
l mean.. 10 to 15 have chased me..

1385
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,999
Don't you have any girl friend now?

1386
01:43:49,833 --> 01:43:52,874
l heard that girls from
Hyderabad are quite fast.

1387
01:43:52,958 --> 01:43:54,624
Are they so weak?

1388
01:43:55,333 --> 01:44:01,624
Well, did you set any condition
regarding girl friend?

1389
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:06,249
l am tall so l wish
my girl friend to have..

1390
01:44:06,333 --> 01:44:09,374
..an average height.

1391
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:14,499
lf you are in first floor..

1392
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:16,290
..and the girl is on ground
floor then how will it work.

1393
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:18,749
Girl too should be on first floor.
Then only everything will match.

1394
01:44:18,833 --> 01:44:19,790
Did you understand?

1395
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:22,540
Do you have something else?

1396
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:25,457
Educated girl will be better.

1397
01:44:25,541 --> 01:44:28,165
What better? Will you eat education?

1398
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:31,082
lf both are educated then
they will have ego problems.

1399
01:44:31,166 --> 01:44:33,082
They will never get along well.

1400
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:36,249
lt is sufficient if the girl could teach
alphabets and cooking to children.

1401
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,207
Use little bit.

1402
01:44:44,083 --> 01:44:45,624
ls there anything else?

1403
01:44:47,083 --> 01:44:50,957
l think an orphan girl
will take good care of mother.

1404
01:44:52,708 --> 01:44:55,665
lt the girl is alone
then she will think that..

1405
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:58,374
..you too should be alone.

1406
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:02,790
lf the girl is from a joint
family then she knows family values..

1407
01:45:02,875 --> 01:45:05,832
..and will take good
care of you and your mother.

1408
01:45:08,208 --> 01:45:10,749
Marriage is a one time opportunity.

1409
01:45:10,833 --> 01:45:12,915
lf given a chance then
the girl should take good care..

1410
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:15,040
..of the boy and his family.

1411
01:45:16,875 --> 01:45:18,415
Am l right?

1412
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:20,624
That's okay. Your love story is fine.

1413
01:45:20,708 --> 01:45:22,999
Why don't you tell the family
that you and Naalu love each other?

1414
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:24,874
What is the problem?
- What?

1415
01:45:24,958 --> 01:45:27,124
Love with brother-in-law Naalu?

1416
01:45:28,125 --> 01:45:30,749
lt is okay that you said this to me.

1417
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:32,540
Don't tell this in front of him.

1418
01:45:32,625 --> 01:45:35,582
He will die of heart attack
if he hears it. He is a dark soul.

1419
01:45:35,666 --> 01:45:37,040
Though he is my brother-in-law
by relationship..

1420
01:45:37,125 --> 01:45:38,665
..he has brought me up.

1421
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:40,165
Foolish guy.
- What?

1422
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:46,457
l don't want more chocolates.
lt is not good.

1423
01:45:59,958 --> 01:46:03,957
Deva doesn't care for anything
because of these people.

1424
01:46:04,375 --> 01:46:08,915
Let us see what he will do if everything
turns into ashes by morning.

1425
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:33,499
Hey! Who is it?

1426
01:46:33,583 --> 01:46:35,665
Houses are set on fire! Come!

1427
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:37,124
Come!

1428
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:01,915
Sir, we are living without
sleep for the last 20 years because..

1429
01:47:01,958 --> 01:47:03,624
..l don't want the enmity
between two families..

1430
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:06,165
..to spread between two villages

1431
01:47:07,958 --> 01:47:12,749
Sir, though they are attacking
my family with swords..

1432
01:47:13,208 --> 01:47:16,457
..l am tolerating it with
pain but l am not retaliating.

1433
01:47:16,833 --> 01:47:18,832
Sir, had our men not
come on time last night then..

1434
01:47:18,916 --> 01:47:20,665
..the entire village would
have turned into graveyard.

1435
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:22,832
Farmers have sold their crop.

1436
01:47:22,916 --> 01:47:24,540
l think they must have got drunk and..

1437
01:47:24,625 --> 01:47:26,582
..set their own houses on fire.

1438
01:47:26,666 --> 01:47:28,957
ln fact there is an educated
boy in their family.

1439
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:31,915
He must have told them
that they will get insurance.

1440
01:47:31,958 --> 01:47:34,499
They didn't think of
anything and went ahead.

1441
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:44,124
S.P. sir, don't believe them
and call us for again for nothing.

1442
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:47,124
Otherwise we wish to do
things that we never wanted to do.

1443
01:47:55,541 --> 01:47:59,457
Sorry, Deva.
l too know that they have done it.

1444
01:47:59,541 --> 01:48:01,749
But we cannot do anything.

1445
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,332
Sir, even the rising
sun gets tired and goes down..

1446
01:48:11,625 --> 01:48:16,582
..but l don't understand
when they will get tired.

1447
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:18,874
Greetings.

1448
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:27,540
l thought men from this
area will retaliate with weapons..

1449
01:48:27,625 --> 01:48:29,499
..if they are attacked.

1450
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:33,540
l didn't think they are cowards
and will approach the police.

1451
01:48:33,625 --> 01:48:35,874
This time only houses are set on fire.

1452
01:48:35,958 --> 01:48:38,124
Don't know where he
will go if the members..

1453
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:39,957
..of the house too are set on fire.

1454
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,374
Are you a human being or animal?

1455
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:43,124
Will you call me animal?

1456
01:48:43,666 --> 01:48:44,790
Leave them!

1457
01:48:44,875 --> 01:48:46,999
Listen to me!

1458
01:48:47,083 --> 01:48:47,957
Cool!

1459
01:48:48,041 --> 01:48:49,207
Cool l say!

1460
01:48:49,291 --> 01:48:51,415
Stop it! Everybody cool!

1461
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,582
Where, Jai?

1462
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,165
lt was..

1463
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:26,165
Forget the collar, l have come
to your village and held your neck.

1464
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:32,874
You need to make a sketch
if you want to come to my village.

1465
01:49:32,958 --> 01:49:35,790
l will come byjust wearing a shirt.

1466
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:42,457
Stop!

1467
01:49:51,625 --> 01:49:52,874
Jai.

1468
01:49:57,041 --> 01:49:58,582
Where did you go?

1469
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,290
Brother, he knows some
people living nearby.

1470
01:50:01,375 --> 01:50:03,415
We went to meet them.

1471
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:05,415
Situation in the village is not good.

1472
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:07,415
There is some problem.

1473
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:10,957
You have come to spend
some good time here.

1474
01:50:12,166 --> 01:50:14,040
lt is not good for you
to stay here during this time.

1475
01:50:18,541 --> 01:50:21,165
People from neighbouring
village shouldn't even..

1476
01:50:22,041 --> 01:50:23,624
..know how you look.

1477
01:50:25,541 --> 01:50:28,040
lf something happens to you
then l will repent all my life.

1478
01:50:28,958 --> 01:50:30,457
You leave, Jai.

1479
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:32,790
Okay, father.

1480
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:38,457
l have pinned all my
hopes on her since childhood.

1481
01:50:38,541 --> 01:50:39,874
How can she go by leaving me?

1482
01:50:39,958 --> 01:50:40,999
Where is she going?

1483
01:50:41,083 --> 01:50:42,457
She is going to dojob. lsn't it?

1484
01:50:42,541 --> 01:50:44,999
Oh! Will she get collector's
job for her education?

1485
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:48,874
What is that he has and l don't?

1486
01:50:48,958 --> 01:50:50,957
What is the difference between
you and me? - Difference..

1487
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:55,790
Difference.. Sit down. Let us discuss.

1488
01:50:55,875 --> 01:50:57,124
Yes. Yes. We should discuss.

1489
01:50:57,208 --> 01:50:59,082
What is his height?

1490
01:50:59,166 --> 01:51:00,874
He will be of my height
if he wears shoes.

1491
01:51:00,958 --> 01:51:03,082
Are you blind?

1492
01:51:03,166 --> 01:51:05,874
He is of your height
even when he sits on chair.

1493
01:51:06,125 --> 01:51:07,374
Forget height.

1494
01:51:07,458 --> 01:51:08,790
Then colour?

1495
01:51:08,875 --> 01:51:10,207
What is wrong with his colour?

1496
01:51:10,291 --> 01:51:12,165
Leave it! My colour too is good.

1497
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:13,499
Yours?

1498
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:17,499
Well, l am bit dark.
Okay. Forget it. Forget.

1499
01:51:17,583 --> 01:51:19,124
Next.
- Next..

1500
01:51:19,208 --> 01:51:20,540
Education.

1501
01:51:20,625 --> 01:51:22,165
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Sit down. Sit down.

1502
01:51:22,916 --> 01:51:24,082
He doesn't have it, right?
- Yes.

1503
01:51:24,166 --> 01:51:25,665
Forget it.
- Next..

1504
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:29,124
Hey! Hey! Hey! Sit down. Sit down.

1505
01:51:29,208 --> 01:51:30,624
Everyone is leaving.

1506
01:51:30,708 --> 01:51:32,290
How will l get a job
without having any education?

1507
01:51:32,375 --> 01:51:33,540
How is it possible?
Don't we know that?

1508
01:51:33,625 --> 01:51:34,790
Sit down.

1509
01:51:34,875 --> 01:51:36,832
Forget it!
Forget it! Forget it! What is next?

1510
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:39,749
What will remain if
everything is forgotten?

1511
01:51:39,833 --> 01:51:42,499
Do something. Go to the
girl and tell her everything.

1512
01:51:42,583 --> 01:51:44,499
You will get the answer.

1513
01:51:47,541 --> 01:51:50,582
He would come to make
compromise even when..

1514
01:51:50,666 --> 01:51:55,749
..people were attacked
and killed from his village.

1515
01:51:56,916 --> 01:52:01,124
A man from that family comes and..

1516
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:02,749
Who is he?

1517
01:52:03,458 --> 01:52:04,915
Who has got that guts?

1518
01:52:05,166 --> 01:52:06,499
His son.

1519
01:52:10,208 --> 01:52:11,707
Deva's son.

1520
01:52:12,791 --> 01:52:15,124
We should be careful, brother.

1521
01:52:15,375 --> 01:52:23,915
lf he comes here then
he will not spare anyone.

1522
01:52:23,958 --> 01:52:25,582
Where does he live?

1523
01:52:25,666 --> 01:52:27,707
He lives in Hyderabad with his mother.

1524
01:52:27,791 --> 01:52:30,290
He came to this village as a guest.

1525
01:52:32,541 --> 01:52:36,915
That village is living in fear.

1526
01:52:37,666 --> 01:52:40,957
lf this man supports them then the
entire village will turn against us.

1527
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,082
This man should die in Hyderabad.

1528
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:46,249
Call us daily.

1529
01:52:48,875 --> 01:52:50,582
Hey! What is it with him?

1530
01:52:50,666 --> 01:52:53,124
Vennu, l want to tell you something.

1531
01:52:53,208 --> 01:52:55,832
l am going out of town.
What is it now? Tell me fast.

1532
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,957
l don't understand
from where l should start.

1533
01:53:05,875 --> 01:53:06,957
lt is..

1534
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,457
l grew up watching
you since childhood.

1535
01:53:10,958 --> 01:53:12,957
l always think of you.

1536
01:53:13,958 --> 01:53:16,290
l don't know whether it is
right or wrong to tell like this.

1537
01:53:16,375 --> 01:53:20,915
Your personality
and beauty make me mad.

1538
01:53:22,125 --> 01:53:23,957
Whether anybody likes it or not..

1539
01:53:24,041 --> 01:53:27,499
..we both will make a good couple.

1540
01:53:27,583 --> 01:53:32,790
l love you. l love you. l love..

1541
01:53:39,583 --> 01:53:40,665
l love you, uncle.

1542
01:53:40,750 --> 01:53:44,374
l thought you are just a fool.
You are worse than that.

1543
01:53:45,916 --> 01:53:47,332
l will kill you.

1544
01:53:47,416 --> 01:53:49,165
You just want to escape to Hyderabad.

1545
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:50,290
Otherwise who will give
you a job for you education.

1546
01:53:50,375 --> 01:53:53,124
You are taking a mad girl with you.
l think you will face problem.

1547
01:53:55,833 --> 01:53:57,124
Bye, father.

1548
01:54:02,291 --> 01:54:03,874
Bye, mother.

1549
01:54:03,958 --> 01:54:06,082
Bye, brother-in-law. Take care.

1550
01:54:06,166 --> 01:54:07,374
Bye!

1551
01:54:12,083 --> 01:54:14,165
Aunt, you still look very beautiful.

1552
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:16,957
Uncle will fall for
you even at this age.

1553
01:54:17,458 --> 01:54:21,165
Okay. Brother-in-law is
going to office. Go and see.

1554
01:54:22,958 --> 01:54:24,374
Vennela.

1555
01:54:27,458 --> 01:54:30,082
Do fights still take place in village?

1556
01:54:30,166 --> 01:54:31,540
No. Not in uncle's presence.

1557
01:54:31,625 --> 01:54:33,957
He will not let people fight.

1558
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:36,624
Everyone should live
in peace like him.

1559
01:54:47,916 --> 01:54:49,999
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1560
01:54:50,708 --> 01:54:52,332
Good morning.
- Good morning, madam.

1561
01:54:52,416 --> 01:54:53,540
Come.

1562
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:57,665
Hi, Kishore. This is Vennela.

1563
01:54:57,750 --> 01:54:59,165
Hello.
- Hi.

1564
01:55:00,208 --> 01:55:02,290
Vennela, this is your cabin.

1565
01:55:02,375 --> 01:55:03,999
That is mine.
- Shut up.

1566
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:23,582
Sir, this is commercial project..
Banjara Hills..

1567
01:55:23,666 --> 01:55:24,999
What are you talking?

1568
01:55:25,083 --> 01:55:26,415
Sir, she has joined newly.

1569
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:27,957
l am teaching her how to work.

1570
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,082
Who said she has come to work?

1571
01:55:30,166 --> 01:55:31,832
She has come to pass time.

1572
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:33,957
lt is better if we do our work.

1573
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,124
She is talking closely with me.

1574
01:55:36,208 --> 01:55:37,790
How should l work?

1575
01:55:37,875 --> 01:55:41,957
She talks like that with dogs,
cats and buffaloes.

1576
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:45,749
lt is not the greatness of animals.
And not yours too.

1577
01:55:45,833 --> 01:55:47,374
You sit in the middle cabin.

1578
01:55:48,875 --> 01:55:52,415
lt is her greatness.

1579
01:55:55,208 --> 01:55:57,582
Kishore!

1580
01:56:18,708 --> 01:56:22,624
"l am going mad watching
your kohl filled eyes."

1581
01:56:22,708 --> 01:56:26,749
"l am going mad watching your gait."

1582
01:56:26,833 --> 01:56:30,790
"l am going mad watching
your smooth lips."

1583
01:56:30,875 --> 01:56:34,915
"l am going mad watching your beauty."

1584
01:56:34,958 --> 01:56:38,957
"l wish to see this
beauty again and again."

1585
01:56:39,041 --> 01:56:41,707
"My heart is running towards you."

1586
01:56:41,791 --> 01:56:45,832
"This is really good."

1587
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:49,915
"Let us consider it as love."

1588
01:56:49,958 --> 01:56:53,957
"This is really good."

1589
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,499
"Let us consider it as love."

1590
01:56:59,375 --> 01:57:01,374
"l am feeling happy.."

1591
01:57:01,458 --> 01:57:03,332
"Happy on hearing
your compliments."

1592
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:07,415
"l am feeling happy
for raising hopes in you."

1593
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:11,457
"l am feeling happy
for making you run behind me."

1594
01:57:11,541 --> 01:57:15,582
"l am feeling happy
for making you crazy for me."

1595
01:57:15,666 --> 01:57:19,415
"l am feeling pity watching your woes."

1596
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:22,415
"Let this continue for some more time."

1597
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:26,499
"This is really good."

1598
01:57:26,583 --> 01:57:30,540
"Let us consider it as love."

1599
01:57:30,625 --> 01:57:34,582
"This is really good."

1600
01:57:34,666 --> 01:57:39,040
"Let us consider it as love."

1601
01:57:42,791 --> 01:57:44,415
Father, how is the bike?

1602
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,624
Loved it.
- Don't drink and drive.

1603
01:57:46,708 --> 01:57:47,957
Okay.

1604
01:57:59,625 --> 01:58:07,707
"Will you find out or should
l tell you the condition of my heart?"

1605
01:58:07,791 --> 01:58:11,832
"l am waiting for it."

1606
01:58:11,916 --> 01:58:16,582
"Make sure l hear your voice."

1607
01:58:16,666 --> 01:58:20,415
"My heart is singing loud."

1608
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:24,249
"lt has fallen for you."

1609
01:58:24,791 --> 01:58:31,499
"l know it says l belong only to you."

1610
01:58:31,583 --> 01:58:35,665
"This is really good."

1611
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:39,749
"Let us consider it as love."

1612
01:58:39,833 --> 01:58:43,499
"This is really good."

1613
01:58:43,583 --> 01:58:48,332
"Let us consider it as love."

1614
01:59:20,958 --> 01:59:24,957
"l am longing for you."

1615
01:59:25,041 --> 01:59:29,082
"l don't want to give up on you."

1616
01:59:29,166 --> 01:59:33,165
"lt will succeed in getting you."

1617
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:37,957
"l am too longing for you."

1618
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,707
"Make sure you get me at any cost."

1619
01:59:41,791 --> 01:59:45,457
"My eyes are never
tired of watching you."

1620
01:59:46,083 --> 01:59:49,874
"l can do anything for you. "

1621
01:59:49,958 --> 01:59:52,832
"l am all for you."

1622
01:59:52,916 --> 01:59:56,999
"This is really good."

1623
01:59:57,083 --> 02:00:01,040
"Let us consider it as love."

1624
02:00:01,125 --> 02:00:05,124
"This is really good."

1625
02:00:05,208 --> 02:00:09,999
"Let us consider it as love."

1626
02:00:41,416 --> 02:00:43,582
Whom do you want to meet?

1627
02:00:46,416 --> 02:00:49,582
One person from our village
lives here. We came to meet him.

1628
02:00:49,666 --> 02:00:52,249
They went out. They will
come in short time. Sit down.

1629
02:00:53,166 --> 02:00:55,499
We are many people.
We will go and have tea in a hotel.

1630
02:00:58,375 --> 02:01:01,749
Poorna sir, we will go only
if we are confident of killing him.

1631
02:01:01,833 --> 02:01:04,665
lf he stays alive then
it will be very dangerous.

1632
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:05,957
Hey!

1633
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:09,040
We should go to our village
by carrying his head.

1634
02:01:18,083 --> 02:01:20,415
Wait, sir. He is going inside.

1635
02:01:25,833 --> 02:01:27,874
Sir, around ten people have
come from your village to meet you.

1636
02:01:27,958 --> 02:01:30,040
l told them to sit. They went
to drink tea in the opposite hotel.

1637
02:01:50,833 --> 02:01:52,290
Hey, you start the vehicle.

1638
02:01:52,375 --> 02:01:54,499
Poorna sir, he is somewhere around.

1639
02:01:54,583 --> 02:01:55,832
He came to know about us.

1640
02:01:55,916 --> 02:01:57,749
He will kill us too.
Listen to me. Let us go!

1641
02:01:57,833 --> 02:02:00,957
He will not keep quiet if we attack.
He is a tiger.

1642
02:02:01,041 --> 02:02:02,707
He will kill us!

1643
02:02:02,791 --> 02:02:03,999
Start the vehicle!

1644
02:02:04,083 --> 02:02:06,749
Come!
Get inside!

1645
02:02:07,583 --> 02:02:11,165
Start! Go!

1646
02:02:20,791 --> 02:02:23,290
30 people went and
only 3 have returned.

1647
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,957
ls he a human being?

1648
02:02:26,833 --> 02:02:28,332
They say he is a tiger.

1649
02:02:28,416 --> 02:02:30,790
l will cut the tiger's head.

1650
02:02:31,333 --> 02:02:33,915
l will hang it on the
village outskirts and..

1651
02:02:33,958 --> 02:02:37,207
..make them remember
it all their lives.

1652
02:02:37,500 --> 02:02:39,957
'They will not change.
lt is better l escape.'

1653
02:02:41,333 --> 02:02:42,332
Hello.

1654
02:02:43,791 --> 02:02:44,749
Vennela.

1655
02:02:44,833 --> 02:02:48,624
Aunt, my family has
selected a boy for me.

1656
02:02:48,708 --> 02:02:51,999
But l like brother-in-law.

1657
02:02:53,833 --> 02:02:56,082
l cannot think of anyone
other than brother-in-law.

1658
02:03:03,291 --> 02:03:05,124
Bye.
- Bye. Get inside.

1659
02:03:05,208 --> 02:03:06,832
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1660
02:03:06,916 --> 02:03:07,957
Okay.

1661
02:03:09,958 --> 02:03:10,874
Greetings.

1662
02:03:12,875 --> 02:03:15,249
Brother-in-law,
your responsibility is over.

1663
02:03:17,708 --> 02:03:20,332
One has left and
another arrived. Fate.

1664
02:03:29,708 --> 02:03:31,749
Son, finally her marriage is fixed.

1665
02:03:35,458 --> 02:03:38,290
They say that they will
do everything as you wish.

1666
02:03:38,375 --> 02:03:41,249
Boy lives in America.
You will live a happy life, dear.

1667
02:03:41,333 --> 02:03:43,124
Uncle, she will not be happy in a rich
family or the one that lives in America.

1668
02:03:43,208 --> 02:03:45,165
She will be happy if the
boy takes good care of her.

1669
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:50,624
Uncle, she won't live happily
if you send her to some faraway place.

1670
02:03:55,875 --> 02:03:59,957
She will be happy if she
finds a boy who loves her truly.

1671
02:04:00,166 --> 02:04:04,457
Uncle, she is not an article
to change her as they wish.

1672
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:11,915
She is a wonderful girl.

1673
02:04:13,791 --> 02:04:16,249
She will be happy if she finds a boy..

1674
02:04:16,333 --> 02:04:18,332
..who understands her very well.

1675
02:04:22,041 --> 02:04:24,957
Son, it is nothing
wrong if we wish all that.

1676
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,957
But where can we find
such a boy these days.

1677
02:04:36,958 --> 02:04:38,874
Will you give a single chance?

1678
02:04:39,541 --> 02:04:41,832
l will hide you here all my life.

1679
02:05:10,708 --> 02:05:14,082
"Like a fish out of water.."

1680
02:05:14,166 --> 02:05:17,249
"My heart is jumping around.."

1681
02:05:17,333 --> 02:05:20,415
"Darling, oh, my darling."

1682
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:23,624
"Darling! My feeling."

1683
02:05:23,708 --> 02:05:27,707
"Like you have fallen all over me.."

1684
02:05:27,791 --> 02:05:30,832
"l have dreamt of a beautiful scene."

1685
02:05:30,916 --> 02:05:34,124
"Darling, oh, my darling."

1686
02:05:34,208 --> 02:05:37,415
"Darling! My feeling."

1687
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:40,707
"l feel as if l am hit for a six.."

1688
02:05:40,791 --> 02:05:43,999
"l am spinning like a ball."

1689
02:05:44,333 --> 02:05:47,415
"As if l am contained
inside a bottle.."

1690
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:50,832
"l am feeling suffocated."

1691
02:05:50,916 --> 02:05:52,790
"Enough of the waiting.."

1692
02:05:52,875 --> 02:05:55,582
"Arrange the meeting immediately."

1693
02:05:56,125 --> 02:06:09,332
"Darling, oh, my darling."

1694
02:06:29,958 --> 02:06:33,290
"You are a firecracker.
l am the matchstick."

1695
02:06:33,375 --> 02:06:36,707
"Let us burst together
and celebrate Diwali festival."

1696
02:06:40,125 --> 02:06:43,499
"You are as sharp as knife..
l am ready to tread it.."

1697
02:06:43,583 --> 02:06:46,957
"Let us rip everything apart."

1698
02:06:50,083 --> 02:06:53,874
"l will hug you close to my heart."

1699
02:06:53,958 --> 02:06:56,957
"Come, oh my darling."

1700
02:06:57,250 --> 02:07:03,790
"l will love you and
make you forget the world."

1701
02:07:03,875 --> 02:07:07,082
"Darling, oh, my darling."

1702
02:07:07,166 --> 02:07:10,082
"Darling! My feeling."

1703
02:07:10,166 --> 02:07:13,707
"Darling, oh, my darling."

1704
02:07:13,958 --> 02:07:17,165
"Darling! My feeling."

1705
02:07:40,875 --> 02:07:44,124
When will the day come
when l can hold you close..

1706
02:07:44,208 --> 02:07:47,665
..to my heart and scold you.

1707
02:07:51,083 --> 02:07:54,165
"Baby, all your desires
will be fulfilled very soon."

1708
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:57,874
"That day is not far."

1709
02:07:59,833 --> 02:08:06,165
"Darling, do something to
me so that l become one with you."

1710
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:09,957
"Darling, your complexion
and taste is remarkable."

1711
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,999
"Come to me and hold me."

1712
02:08:13,083 --> 02:08:16,082
"Darling, oh, my darling."

1713
02:08:16,291 --> 02:08:19,457
"Darling! My feeling."

1714
02:08:19,625 --> 02:08:23,165
"Darling, oh, my darling."

1715
02:08:23,250 --> 02:08:26,582
"Darling! My feeling."

1716
02:09:02,666 --> 02:09:04,082
How are you, sister-in-law?

1717
02:09:04,166 --> 02:09:05,665
l am fine, Laxmi.

1718
02:09:17,666 --> 02:09:19,207
How are you, Deva?

1719
02:09:24,583 --> 02:09:26,374
ln spite of knowing what you are..

1720
02:09:27,666 --> 02:09:31,124
..l went away from you thinking that..

1721
02:09:32,791 --> 02:09:34,749
..nobody can change
you for what you are.

1722
02:09:36,083 --> 02:09:38,374
l have given you the punishment that..

1723
02:09:39,958 --> 02:09:41,790
..no wife would ever
give to her husband

1724
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:47,082
Though l went away from you,
l brought him up like you..

1725
02:09:47,166 --> 02:09:49,624
..by thinking of you all the time.

1726
02:09:49,708 --> 02:09:53,415
l have filled his life with love.

1727
02:09:56,541 --> 02:10:00,499
Deva, l will not go by leaving
you as long as l am alive.

1728
02:10:16,833 --> 02:10:19,249
Father, though you cannot speak..

1729
02:10:19,333 --> 02:10:22,040
..your eyes are saying
that you wish for enemy's death.

1730
02:10:22,416 --> 02:10:24,957
l will wash your feet
with the blood of the people..

1731
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,207
..who had done this to you.

1732
02:10:33,125 --> 02:10:34,457
Kareemulla!

1733
02:10:40,291 --> 02:10:41,957
Hey, eat and go.

1734
02:11:06,083 --> 02:11:07,374
What happened?

1735
02:11:15,083 --> 02:11:17,332
Deva sir,
l want to tell you something.

1736
02:11:19,458 --> 02:11:22,624
Sir, the fights that you
have prevented from taking place..

1737
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:25,040
..all these years have started again.

1738
02:11:26,916 --> 02:11:30,082
Reason is your son.

1739
02:11:37,041 --> 02:11:39,874
Sir, l am afraid as
what might happen anytime.

1740
02:11:40,166 --> 02:11:42,665
lt is better if you remain careful.

1741
02:11:43,833 --> 02:11:44,999
Greetings, sir.

1742
02:11:52,958 --> 02:11:55,540
Sir, go and wear these silk clothes.

1743
02:12:18,375 --> 02:12:20,332
All are found at one place.

1744
02:12:20,708 --> 02:12:23,332
l will kill everyone.

1745
02:12:23,416 --> 02:12:25,832
As long as he is there,
he will not let anybody..

1746
02:12:25,916 --> 02:12:27,540
..harm his family.

1747
02:12:27,833 --> 02:12:30,790
He should be attacked first!

1748
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:41,374
Take them inside.
- Take everyone inside!

1749
02:13:44,125 --> 02:13:45,457
Kill them!

1750
02:15:41,708 --> 02:15:42,957
Aunt!

1751
02:15:45,666 --> 02:15:47,457
Aunt! Aunt!

1752
02:15:47,541 --> 02:15:48,832
Sister!

1753
02:16:11,083 --> 02:16:12,332
Latha!

1754
02:16:56,791 --> 02:16:59,082
Hey! Take out the swords!

1755
02:16:59,166 --> 02:17:00,415
Come!

1756
02:17:02,125 --> 02:17:03,415
Where?

1757
02:17:04,916 --> 02:17:06,957
Not a single person responsible..

1758
02:17:07,041 --> 02:17:09,499
..for mothers' death
should stay alive.

1759
02:17:09,791 --> 02:17:13,665
Keep aside your morals
and ethics for some time..

1760
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:15,582
..and go inside.

1761
02:17:16,958 --> 02:17:20,082
Solution was not found for 20 years.

1762
02:17:20,166 --> 02:17:22,499
l will go and finish
it in two minutes!

1763
02:17:23,875 --> 02:17:27,290
Brother, he says two minutes.
You go inside.

1764
02:17:28,583 --> 02:17:29,999
Sir, you have committed
a similar mistake..

1765
02:17:30,083 --> 02:17:31,499
..20 years back by
stopping us like this.

1766
02:17:31,708 --> 02:17:33,749
Don't repeat the mistake, sir.

1767
02:17:33,833 --> 02:17:35,832
Listen to sir and go inside.

1768
02:17:35,916 --> 02:17:37,915
Before madam's body
is burnt completely..

1769
02:17:37,958 --> 02:17:40,207
..ten people from
that family should die.

1770
02:17:48,125 --> 02:17:50,582
What sin did l commit due
to which you are born to me?

1771
02:17:58,458 --> 02:18:01,082
l have left you and have
been living all these years..

1772
02:18:01,166 --> 02:18:02,999
..for this village and its people.

1773
02:18:03,083 --> 02:18:05,374
l wanted to change
them to human beings.

1774
02:18:05,458 --> 02:18:08,790
But after your coming,
they have become animals.

1775
02:18:13,875 --> 02:18:16,832
Your mother said she has
filled your life with love.

1776
02:18:18,958 --> 02:18:20,957
You have cheated her.

1777
02:18:22,208 --> 02:18:24,707
She left this village out of fear.

1778
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:27,790
But you have brought
that fear back and..

1779
02:18:28,625 --> 02:18:31,832
..thereby made your
mother leave this world.

1780
02:18:38,583 --> 02:18:41,374
Had l known that this village
will become like this again..

1781
02:18:42,291 --> 02:18:44,124
..because of you, l wouldn't
have allowed you to come here.

1782
02:18:45,666 --> 02:18:48,582
lf l knew that she
will die because of you..

1783
02:18:50,625 --> 02:18:52,874
..then l wouldn't
have given you birth.

1784
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:03,999
lt would have been good
if you had died instead of her.

1785
02:19:12,291 --> 02:19:13,457
Go.

1786
02:19:13,791 --> 02:19:18,124
Leave this village. Go away from us.

1787
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:25,332
Don't come even after l die.

1788
02:19:38,625 --> 02:19:39,749
Sir!

1789
02:19:39,833 --> 02:19:41,707
Sir! Sir!

1790
02:19:45,041 --> 02:19:46,124
Brother-in-law!

1791
02:19:54,708 --> 02:19:58,582
No, dear. You don't need
a heartless man like him.

1792
02:19:59,125 --> 02:20:02,874
He got his mother killed.
Tomorrow you too..

1793
02:20:03,833 --> 02:20:07,582
He has come like a guest.
Let him leave like a guest.

1794
02:20:17,708 --> 02:20:22,749
"You have given us hope.
You have shown us the way."

1795
02:20:22,833 --> 02:20:25,957
"Who else do we have now?"

1796
02:20:27,791 --> 02:20:30,790
"Who will lead us now?"

1797
02:20:30,875 --> 02:20:37,374
"Our lives will be filled
with sorrow without you."

1798
02:21:07,416 --> 02:21:11,290
Though l felt hurt by father's words,
l found them to be true.

1799
02:21:12,208 --> 02:21:16,290
Because of my going there,
fights and problems took place.

1800
02:21:17,375 --> 02:21:19,624
l went abroad thinking that
things will fall into place..

1801
02:21:19,708 --> 02:21:21,332
..if l leave the village.

1802
02:21:21,541 --> 02:21:26,082
But through Vennela,
l came to know that everyone..

1803
02:21:26,375 --> 02:21:29,207
..has given up on father's
ideas and are back to fighting.

1804
02:21:29,791 --> 02:21:31,832
This problem has stated with me.

1805
02:21:31,916 --> 02:21:33,624
So l thought of stopping it myself.

1806
02:21:35,791 --> 02:21:38,165
And then l met you at the right time.

1807
02:21:39,208 --> 02:21:41,582
After watching you,
l understood that..

1808
02:21:41,666 --> 02:21:43,874
..yours villagers too are
suffering from fights like ours.

1809
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:46,165
l came to your house through you.

1810
02:21:47,666 --> 02:21:49,457
l tried to change everyone.

1811
02:21:49,541 --> 02:21:53,624
lf my family is so happy today
then you are the reason for it.

1812
02:21:54,750 --> 02:21:57,749
This is enough, Jai.
You leave from here.

1813
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,874
Jai, l am not telling you
all this because l cannot get you.

1814
02:22:01,958 --> 02:22:03,749
l am afraid to think
as what will happen..

1815
02:22:03,833 --> 02:22:07,707
..if everyone comes to know
that you belong to that village.

1816
02:22:08,416 --> 02:22:09,957
Manasa, l will leave from
here only after finishing the..

1817
02:22:10,041 --> 02:22:11,624
..work that l have come for.

1818
02:22:22,625 --> 02:22:23,915
Jai.

1819
02:22:27,041 --> 02:22:30,290
l don't know from where you
came and for what you have come.

1820
02:22:30,375 --> 02:22:33,957
But we all wish you to become
the son-in-law of this house.

1821
02:22:35,333 --> 02:22:38,374
Though she is my daughter,
she is not as bad as us.

1822
02:22:38,458 --> 02:22:40,457
She knows what is good and bad.

1823
02:22:40,541 --> 02:22:43,957
lf you have no objection
to it then inform your parents.

1824
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,457
l will talk.

1825
02:22:54,791 --> 02:22:56,165
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1826
02:22:56,250 --> 02:22:57,540
You got it.

1827
02:22:57,750 --> 02:23:00,374
Son, though you used
every family member..

1828
02:23:00,458 --> 02:23:01,707
..you have achieved what you wanted.

1829
02:23:01,791 --> 02:23:03,540
You got that girl.

1830
02:23:03,625 --> 02:23:05,457
Mr. Pratap,
it shouldn't happen like this.

1831
02:23:05,541 --> 02:23:06,957
What is this?

1832
02:23:07,583 --> 02:23:09,915
l am the son of their enemy Deva.

1833
02:23:17,541 --> 02:23:19,040
Stop.

1834
02:23:26,833 --> 02:23:28,832
What are you thinking?

1835
02:23:29,125 --> 02:23:31,957
Are you thinking that your
work has finished quite early?

1836
02:23:32,041 --> 02:23:34,290
l thought of finding a man for her.

1837
02:23:35,625 --> 02:23:40,249
You neither have pride nor manhood.

1838
02:23:41,708 --> 02:23:43,374
l am unable to understand
how this family liked you.

1839
02:23:49,375 --> 02:23:53,832
Let us keep the girl's
matter aside for some time.

1840
02:23:56,458 --> 02:23:58,165
What is the second one?

1841
02:23:58,250 --> 02:24:00,207
Man and manhood..

1842
02:24:00,291 --> 02:24:01,749
What is manhood?

1843
02:24:02,583 --> 02:24:05,040
Not one like you
who keeps quiet even..

1844
02:24:05,125 --> 02:24:07,707
..when a person abuses you.

1845
02:24:08,291 --> 02:24:10,082
Man is one who has
nerves of steel and..

1846
02:24:10,166 --> 02:24:14,624
..who is always ready to fight back.

1847
02:24:18,625 --> 02:24:21,249
Even if they don't carry any weapons..

1848
02:24:21,333 --> 02:24:23,165
..they are always ready
to fight the enemy..

1849
02:24:23,250 --> 02:24:25,249
..whenever they are attacked.

1850
02:24:25,625 --> 02:24:26,999
They are men.

1851
02:24:28,458 --> 02:24:31,332
ls it manhood to kill people?

1852
02:24:32,333 --> 02:24:34,832
lt belongs to stone age.

1853
02:24:34,916 --> 02:24:36,957
That doesn't need courage and valour.

1854
02:24:37,041 --> 02:24:40,665
Manhood means to
befriend even our enemy.

1855
02:24:40,750 --> 02:24:42,165
lt needs..

1856
02:24:45,291 --> 02:24:46,957
ls it so easy?

1857
02:24:48,458 --> 02:24:49,832
Will you try?

1858
02:24:52,041 --> 02:24:54,915
Hey, his manhood lies in words.

1859
02:24:54,958 --> 02:24:58,332
He got scared when asked to fight.

1860
02:25:06,625 --> 02:25:10,415
You told to love the enemy.
l will try that manhood.

1861
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:17,832
But what if you try the
manhood that l talked about.

1862
02:25:25,833 --> 02:25:27,665
He should see stars!

1863
02:26:19,791 --> 02:26:22,915
"A true warrior has arrived."

1864
02:26:22,958 --> 02:26:26,040
"He knows to fight
as well as love the enemy."

1865
02:26:26,125 --> 02:26:28,874
"A true warrior has arrived."

1866
02:26:28,958 --> 02:26:32,374
"He knows to fight
as well as love the enemy."

1867
02:26:44,916 --> 02:26:48,165
"A true warrior has arrived."

1868
02:26:48,250 --> 02:26:52,165
"He knows to fight
as well as love the enemy."

1869
02:27:16,625 --> 02:27:18,915
l have tried the manhood
that you talked about.

1870
02:27:20,958 --> 02:27:23,124
Will you try the
manhood that l told you?

1871
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:46,165
Don't know how many days
it will take for them to recover.

1872
02:27:47,166 --> 02:27:49,749
We are not sure even
if they will recover or not.

1873
02:27:51,958 --> 02:27:56,582
l liked you.
l am searching for a boy like you.

1874
02:27:57,833 --> 02:28:00,915
l will give her hand
in marriage to you.

1875
02:28:01,208 --> 02:28:03,040
But l want one help.

1876
02:28:05,583 --> 02:28:08,040
There is one man from that village..

1877
02:28:08,125 --> 02:28:10,207
..who is filled with
courage and pride.

1878
02:28:10,291 --> 02:28:12,499
Kill him and fulfil my revenge.

1879
02:28:12,583 --> 02:28:14,582
l will serve you
for the rest of my life.

1880
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:20,332
Will..

1881
02:28:20,416 --> 02:28:21,915
Will you not change?

1882
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:25,457
You will not change?

1883
02:28:29,125 --> 02:28:32,457
The man from that village
who fought back and..

1884
02:28:32,541 --> 02:28:37,957
..gave you sleepless nights is dead.

1885
02:28:38,166 --> 02:28:41,624
The pride of that family
which held your neck..

1886
02:28:41,708 --> 02:28:45,165
..when you attacked
them once has died.

1887
02:28:45,833 --> 02:28:52,499
He is dead.
He is filled with love now.

1888
02:28:52,750 --> 02:28:55,207
He is now filled with
love and has come to you.

1889
02:28:55,750 --> 02:28:58,040
He is in front of your eyes.

1890
02:29:06,916 --> 02:29:11,165
So the enemy and my arch
rival whom l am searching is..

1891
02:29:11,416 --> 02:29:12,499
Hey!

1892
02:29:19,208 --> 02:29:20,249
Uncle!

1893
02:29:24,083 --> 02:29:25,249
Come!

1894
02:29:35,541 --> 02:29:38,082
Stop! Are you mad?

1895
02:29:38,166 --> 02:29:40,290
lt is this guy who fooled us.

1896
02:29:40,375 --> 02:29:41,957
We thought he is our man.

1897
02:29:42,041 --> 02:29:43,499
He is our enemy!

1898
02:30:04,916 --> 02:30:07,874
We thought of making
him our son-in-law!

1899
02:30:07,958 --> 02:30:10,790
He has come to destroy our family!

1900
02:30:32,166 --> 02:30:35,082
l am alive only to kill you!

1901
02:30:52,541 --> 02:30:55,665
You have come to live with enemy.

1902
02:30:55,750 --> 02:30:57,540
You are not an ordinary man.

1903
02:30:57,625 --> 02:31:00,082
You should die!

1904
02:31:12,208 --> 02:31:14,374
Uncle! Please, uncle.

1905
02:31:14,458 --> 02:31:15,790
Tell him to stop!

1906
02:31:15,875 --> 02:31:20,707
Man, you will not keep quiet
if l enter that village or attack it!

1907
02:31:21,416 --> 02:31:22,707
Brother!

1908
02:31:22,791 --> 02:31:24,124
Brother, tell him to stop!

1909
02:31:24,208 --> 02:31:28,749
l will kill you, Deva and his family!

1910
02:32:09,375 --> 02:32:12,457
lf l get back to my old
style for ten minutes then..

1911
02:32:12,541 --> 02:32:14,874
..nobody from this
family will stay alive.

1912
02:32:24,791 --> 02:32:26,832
You have killed my mother.

1913
02:32:28,500 --> 02:32:31,707
But l am living with love
after coming to your family!

1914
02:32:48,958 --> 02:32:50,749
You have separated me from my father!

1915
02:32:50,833 --> 02:32:52,457
You have separated me from my love!

1916
02:32:52,541 --> 02:32:55,165
But l came closer to you with love!

1917
02:33:08,458 --> 02:33:09,999
For how long?

1918
02:33:10,083 --> 02:33:12,457
For how long should
people cry because of you?

1919
02:33:28,875 --> 02:33:33,415
l had given up revenge
and left my village for peace.

1920
02:33:33,500 --> 02:33:35,415
Do you want to kill such a person?

1921
02:33:50,333 --> 02:33:54,499
lf l start using the sword
then nobody can use it better than me.

1922
02:33:56,375 --> 02:33:58,915
But only swords will
remain in the end.

1923
02:33:59,708 --> 02:34:01,499
Human beings will not remain.

1924
02:34:04,916 --> 02:34:06,999
lf possible then let us love.

1925
02:34:07,083 --> 02:34:08,582
What is there to lose?

1926
02:34:09,708 --> 02:34:12,374
At the most,
the person might love you in return!

1927
02:34:25,291 --> 02:34:28,040
Otherwise if you think that
this enmity will come to end..

1928
02:34:28,125 --> 02:34:30,124
..because of my death then..

1929
02:34:42,375 --> 02:34:44,707
Hey, you said he is not our man.

1930
02:34:44,791 --> 02:34:46,124
You said he is our enemy.

1931
02:34:46,208 --> 02:34:47,915
You said he will kill us.

1932
02:34:47,958 --> 02:34:53,749
But why did he save you
when his men were chasing you.

1933
02:34:59,583 --> 02:35:05,874
Brother, everyone feared
the members of this house till date.

1934
02:35:05,958 --> 02:35:10,457
Ever did you see a person
giving respect to us out of love?

1935
02:35:10,541 --> 02:35:13,374
Though he is the son of our enemy,
he has done it.

1936
02:35:13,458 --> 02:35:14,915
Should we kill him for that?

1937
02:35:21,083 --> 02:35:23,790
Uncle, he is our enemy.

1938
02:35:23,875 --> 02:35:26,499
But still he is living with us.
lt means he wants something.

1939
02:35:26,583 --> 02:35:28,957
lt is not our lives,
property or our girl.

1940
02:35:29,625 --> 02:35:31,165
He wants something else.

1941
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,707
We will give it.

1942
02:35:35,916 --> 02:35:38,332
We will change and give
him his love in return.

1943
02:35:55,458 --> 02:35:56,832
Father!

1944
02:36:08,041 --> 02:36:11,790
He wants love in spite
of living in the enemy's house.

1945
02:36:11,875 --> 02:36:14,957
What are his guts?
He should stay alive.

1946
02:36:15,541 --> 02:36:18,957
He will save more people.
He will save more people.

1947
02:36:32,833 --> 02:36:37,665
Not only in that village,
there is a man in this village too.

1948
02:37:12,375 --> 02:37:13,874
What is this, father?

1949
02:37:15,166 --> 02:37:19,874
l am living for a
dream by leaving you all.

1950
02:37:20,958 --> 02:37:23,249
l couldn't understand
that it would have remained..

1951
02:37:23,333 --> 02:37:26,707
..as a dream without having you.

1952
02:37:27,750 --> 02:37:30,874
l thought if one side gives
up enmity then the other side..

1953
02:37:30,958 --> 02:37:33,457
..will get tired and will do the same.

1954
02:37:34,375 --> 02:37:39,082
You thought it will not
happen unless people change.

1955
02:37:41,250 --> 02:37:43,790
l have separated you
from your love thinking..

1956
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,874
..that you will not be able to love.

1957
02:37:50,958 --> 02:37:52,165
Forgive me.

1958
02:37:52,250 --> 02:37:53,915
What is it, father?

1959
02:37:53,958 --> 02:37:58,457
She is waiting for you
and your love with thousand eyes.

1960
02:37:58,958 --> 02:38:00,040
Go.

1961
02:38:33,333 --> 02:38:35,999
Are you still rejecting
marriage proposals?

1962
02:38:42,708 --> 02:38:46,874
lt is too late. Will you marry me?

1963
02:38:47,208 --> 02:40:17,874
