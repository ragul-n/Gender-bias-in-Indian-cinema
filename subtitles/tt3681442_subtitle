'At the end of
the British rule in 1947...'

2
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:56,445
'...I was in India for
astronomical research'

3
00:01:56,529 --> 00:02:00,908
'I went to a small village in South India
which was tilled with superstition'

4
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:09,041
'The people in the village thought,
I was a British officer'

5
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,209
Everyone greet the officer

6
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:13,295
'I was the first person to
capture them in a camera...'

7
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,215
'...the people possessed a lot of fear'

8
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:24,682
'They saw the camera
as a strange object'

9
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:28,978
'During that time, there had
been an outbreak of disease'

10
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:31,397
'Which had taken
the lives of many people'

11
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,983
'Due to the lack of awareness...'

12
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:37,987
'...they couldn't understand why
so many people are dying'

13
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:44,994
'Being superstitious, they
blamed the photograph'

14
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:46,829
'During that time...'

15
00:02:56,589 --> 00:03:01,635
Oh My God! There is
an epidemic outbreak in our village

16
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,512
Please do protect us

17
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:08,517
'A bandit group had come to rob
the statue in there temple'

18
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:19,236
This idol is the only
hope for our village

19
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,990
Guys, just move away and give us space to
pick up the idol without any damages

20
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:28,204
Please don't take it away, we will
give you everything we have got

21
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,706
I will kneel down and request

22
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:34,168
Why do you have to
kneel and request?

23
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,214
Please tell them not to hurt
Please do tell

24
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:46,722
Please tell them
not to take away our hope

25

I will give you anything you ask for,
Please don't take the idol

26
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,357
Until I am alive,
You can never take it away

27
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,234
Oh God, please save us

28
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:15,251

farther when you are with us"

43
00:05:41,628 --> 00:05:45,424
'The villagers forced me
out of the village'

44
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:57,186
'But I was able to take some samples
of the meteorite for my research'

45
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:03,359
'Of my research, I found that meteorite
contains many priceless materials'

46
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:06,779
'But I didn't want to
break up people's belief'

47
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:09,782
'So I didn't tell anything
about this to the government'

48
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:13,077

- Immediately have to take a photograph
- Sorry, our office won't work today

56
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:02,793
Please don't say that,
I can even pay you more

57
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:05,796
No way, our hero's movie
is releasing today

58
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,007
Without even brushing the teeth,
Guys have gone to buy tickets

59
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:11,927
I heard you're the best
photographer in this district

60
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,055
Since morning, I've been waiting
in front of your shop

61
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:18,434
Okay, you'll find the keys
above the studio door

62
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:19,893
Open the door
and wait inside

63
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:23,939
- Do order for a tea in the nearby shop
- Sure! Thanks for coming

64
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:29,486
Senseless idiot,
want me to wait in this dark

65
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,029
Where will I find the switch?

66
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:33,699
I will switch it on,
You just come in

67
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:36,618
Brother, what are you doing here?

68
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:40,914
You spoke to me on the shop number,
So where do you expect me to be?

69
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:44,334
- Just come
- Okay, brother

70
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,888
Would you like to have a tea?

71
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:56,972
Yes

72
00:07:57,055 --> 00:07:59,892
Good! You go and have it
I'll bath and come

73
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:02,853
Okay, sir

74
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,830
It's a family photo

75
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,250
Stay there

76
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:32,633
You guys ready?

77
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:36,720
Move to your right
Still move

78
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,807
Bit to your left
Yeah now come front

79
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:12,172
Dad, I wanna pee

80
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:15,133
Spread your legs and stand,
you won't pee

81
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,182
Fix your position

82
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:38,031
- I am the King of the world
- Super dude

83
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:40,492
Look there, most of
them went inside

84
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:43,620
If we had waited for the bike to start,
movie would have been over

85
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:12,649
Just because its our stars movie we
shouldn't have gone for all the shows

86
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:15,444
Tomorrow we are repeating the same

87
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:22,909
Your cousins, bro?

88
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:25,078
But their physique
doesn't relate to you

89
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:27,164
You said it's a minute
break and went

90
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:36,548
Is this a studio or a bathroom?
Urinated here

91
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:38,091
Master, your cousin-

92
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:00,322
Sir, we have reached the studio

93
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:13,585
As said by the fortune teller,
lam stepping into Hollywood today

94
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:19,174
Owner: Mr Gopi

95
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:20,967
lam coming

96
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:22,761
Take your tips

97
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:25,681
Hey, first give me
the rickshaw fare

98
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:32,104
Excuse Mr Rickshaw driver, why don't
you get my autographed cheque leaf?

99
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:34,439
Hey useless, your wallet
doesn't have 50 paise

100
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:35,732
But you sign autographs

101
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:37,526
What will you do for today's lunch?

102
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:39,778
I am going in for that
Don't be silly

103
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:48,120
Mr Gopi
How are you?

104
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:51,248
Welcome Eshwaran,
How are you?

105
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:53,583
- Please sit down
- I am seated already

106
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,670
I saw the board outside
It's very nice

107
00:11:57,003 --> 00:12:02,050
Only if we can think big,
we can achieve our goal

108
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,345
Even I have thought
about changing my name

109
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,851
Then how about your
search for movie roles?

110
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,773
Brother, switch on that tan
Don't look at me, switch it on

111
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:22,112
Gopi, I only get double
hero subject scripts

112
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:25,073
Else I get a mini budget script

113
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:28,410
If not the story is very poor

114
00:12:28,535 --> 00:12:32,414
So have decided to act only
in a heavy budget script

115
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:36,209
Thought you had a quarrel
outside for 50 paise

116
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:39,171
0h you heard that
I gave him the money

117
00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:45,218
Let this be within us

118
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:47,763
Hey, switch off the fan

119
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:49,598
Please don't switch off
the fan, Gopi

120
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,224
I'll tell the truth

121
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:56,855
I have to live in front of
the AVM gates, if I wish to be a hero

122
00:12:56,938 --> 00:12:59,524
If I go for auditions,
they bully me

123
00:12:59,816 --> 00:13:01,401
It's been really difficult

124
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:03,278
How to become a hero
within 30 days?

125
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:07,574
That too the trouble from assistants
Too much nowadays

126
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:12,496
- Okay, what's the name of your village?
- Gopi, don't talk about my village

127
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:17,709
They are the ones who buried
my interest in movies

128
00:13:17,793 --> 00:13:22,547
At least there you can do farming
and live with respect

129
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:24,341
Me?

130
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:33,225
Until my movie runs
successfully for 100 days

131
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:34,768
Will never step back

132
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:36,645
That's why I have come to you

133
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:39,272
Please do shoot a few
good photographs of me

134
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:42,317
That's alright! Have you got
money to pay for the photos?

135
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,529
- Definitely, how much?
- 5 copies cost you 5 rupees

136
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:51,868
What will you give for one rupee?

137
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:53,870
Will give you the film negative
Is that, okay?

138
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:56,498
That's okay! They can see me
in that negative right

139
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:59,459
Even a handsome guy would look
like a devil in his negative

140
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:02,045
You look like a devil already,
think about your negative

141
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:04,005
Go and get 5 rupees

142
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,882
Have come without
money to the studio

143
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:10,178
Gopi, just for 5 rupees your
assistant has insulted me

144
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:13,807
I'll come back within
a week with 50 rupees

145
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:15,642
Let me see what you
will do at that time

146
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,143
All the best

147
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,521
Switch off your fan

148
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:23,608
Take the camera

149
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:29,781
Hey Alagumani, it's a girls school
Just come and do you work alone

150
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:31,992
Don't doubt my character master

151
00:14:32,242 --> 00:14:35,495
Girls, we won't
get back our school life

152
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,915
It's good to have a photo
to cherish our memories

153
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,835
So we are gonna have
a photo session today

154
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:44,754
They are the photographers

155
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:50,051
- it will take at least 2 weeks
- It's okay, let me inform HM

156
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:51,511
Okay, I'll do my best

157
00:14:51,595 --> 00:14:53,763
When you are gonna
open your studio?

158
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:01,688
What will be your studio name?

159
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:05,650
- What's your name?
- Subbulakshmi

160
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:08,904
Let's keep it as
Subbulakshmi studio

161
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:16,077
Do add her mom's name as well

162
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,330
Hey Subbulakshmi, your mom's...

163
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:22,250
Still you don't know
how to put your underwear

164
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:23,668
You wanna start a studio?

165
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:25,378
Go and carry the bench

166
00:15:25,462 --> 00:15:27,213
Never allow us to grow

167
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:28,840
I forgot the stand

168
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:43,772
Are you not coming
to take a photo?

169
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:46,691
I am asking you

170
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:10,966
- What did you say?
- I am not feeling well

171
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:14,135
Nothing will happen
if you take a photo, do come

172
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:15,804
No, I don't want

173
00:16:18,974 --> 00:16:22,519
You've got a photogenic face

174
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,521
I don't want it
Please leave me

175
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:26,481
lam having headache

176
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:36,074
Very funny

177
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,043
It's me, right?

178
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:50,839
You didn't have a headache
when you drew this

179
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:57,470
Why it's a protruded nose?

180
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,100
Let's show this to your professor
and see what he comments about this

181
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:05,687
- Come, let's go to the HM
- No...please no

182
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:07,856
Then do come for
the photo shoot

183
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:26,041
"With expectations mounting
All I face is disappointment"

184
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:34,007
"I am uncomfortable
I burn within...l fall...l cry"

185
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:41,014
"You've taken my heart away"

186
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:50,106
Be ready, don't move
and don't close your eyes

187
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,358
All should look at the camera

188
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:55,612
Ready

189
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:13,421
Why don't you sell this bike
and let's go by walk?

190
00:18:13,505 --> 00:18:15,590
All vehicles will drain petrol
when they move

191
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:17,675
But this one drains petrol
even when it's parked

192
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,928
This bike is drunkard master

193
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:22,055
- Hey Alagu
- What?

194
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:26,601
Hey Ezhumalai, do come
and get your photograph

195
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,938
It doesn't matter if the photo
is with you or me

196
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,690
Just keep it safe,
will get it later

197
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:38,404
Senseless idiot, will stick your
photo in the men's restroom

198
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,991
- Hey Alagu
- What?

199
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:45,870
I have to tell you something,
don't mistake me

200
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:47,163
Tell me

201
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:51,876
We took a photo in the school

202
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,752
Yes

203
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:56,297
In that one girl didn't turn up
for the photo shoot

204
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:57,507
IS it?

205
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:59,008
Why?

206
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:01,010
She said she was not feeling good

207
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,641
But the moment I saw her,
I was completely blank

208
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:09,686
Her eyes were speaking something

209
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:11,604
Won't she speak with her mouth?

210
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:20,363
When I looked at her, I felt
a butterfly effect down my stomach

211
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:23,867
Where you hearing
a rumbling noise?

212
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:30,123
Then what, you asked me to do
work and you did the rest

213
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey not like that

214
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:38,006
We can even give away our
Hollywood Studio for her eyes

215
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,095
Look at the consequences

216
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:46,973
Don't think yourselves to
be the MD of AVM studio

217
00:19:47,932 --> 00:19:49,601
Let me tell you something

218
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:54,272
Don't get into trouble
in the name of love

219
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:26,304
Photo has come out well

220
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:32,185
Girls, do give a big hand of
applause for the photographers

221
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,188
Master, are we showing
some circus stunts here?

222
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,150
Sir, distribute the photos to everyone
Let me show this to our HM

223
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,044
Hey Alagumani,
that girl is absent today

224
00:20:58,127 --> 00:20:59,629
Could you please wait?

225
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:02,006
Haven't you brought
an another photo

226
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,676
- For whom?
- For Kalaivani

227
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:07,345
0h for her, but she wasn't
in the photo shoot

228
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:09,681
So what?
Won't you give?

229
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:12,558
She was waiting for the photo

230
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:15,019
She will have it to
cherish our memories

231
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:18,231
Don't worry, I will hand
it over to her tomorrow

232
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:21,025
No, she quit the school

233
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,444
Quit?

234
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:27,365
Coming Friday is her wedding

235
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:30,201
- Wedding?
- Yes

236
00:21:30,368 --> 00:21:34,622
She wants to study
but her parents forced her

237
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:36,749
She was eager to see the photo

238
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,752
If you've brought it yesterday,
you can give it to her

239
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:43,423
Teacher has come

240
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:49,512
Master, let's go

241
00:21:57,729 --> 00:22:02,025
"Like the sweetness of water
that springs through the well"

242
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:05,445
"The ecstatic feel of love
for you passes through me"

243
00:22:05,528 --> 00:22:12,243
"Every sip of it takes
my breath away"

244
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:17,582
'A few days later...'

245
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:45,693
Sir, lord has
come to meet you

246
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,653
Ask him to wait

247
00:23:54,804 --> 00:23:58,433
Hey...hey, do your work guys

248
00:23:58,516 --> 00:24:00,810
Your look makes
half the bottle empty

249
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:02,478
They are looking at the bottle

250
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:08,443
- Sir, photographer has come
- Ask them to be seated, I 'll come

251
00:24:08,526 --> 00:24:09,819
- Okay
- Go

252
00:24:13,448 --> 00:24:15,324
Master, look there

253
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:22,331
Yet to find one,
He has got four

254
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,418
1...2...3-

255
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:26,711
Is that four?

256
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:28,963
Yes

257
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:31,466
I don't see any woman here

258
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:34,677
All of them eloped with somebody

259
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:43,352
- Welcome
- Greetings to you

260
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:48,691
Hey bring it

261
00:24:48,774 --> 00:24:51,652
Why do you walk slow?

262
00:24:51,736 --> 00:24:52,778
Have it

263
00:25:01,454 --> 00:25:02,747
How is it?

264
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:05,041
Soup is very good,
Is it chicken?

265
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:07,710
- No, it's kittens
- Kitten?

266
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:15,551
Our Chinese guests told, drinking
kitten's soup increase your potent

267
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:19,889
From that day it's only kitten's soup
That's what you drink now

268
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:26,687
Initially it'll have a vomiting sensation,
But you'll get used to it

269
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,943
He will also vomit
It's carrot soup

270
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,614
Looks like he'll ask
for an another cup

271
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:39,200
I just had only 2 sips...

272
00:25:39,283 --> 00:25:41,702
Hey Alagumani,
get me a cup of tea

273
00:25:41,786 --> 00:25:43,871
Only 2 spoons soup
irritates my stomach much

274
00:25:43,955 --> 00:25:46,040
I wonder what will happen
if I have a cup full

275
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:48,501
Is this a photo studio?

276
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:50,586
Come, sir
Do come inside

277
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,505
Go inside

278
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:54,549
Sit down

279
00:25:57,969 --> 00:25:59,971
- Greetings!
- Tell me

280
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:01,722
Need to take a photo

281
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:05,393
Stamp, passport, group, family
single, double, master, full...which photo?

282
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:08,896
Don't want those
Just need to take a photo

283
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:14,485
Go inside
and comb your hair

284
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:15,528
O Kay

285
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,586
Where are you going?

286
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:37,008
- Come inside
- Why photograph me?

287
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:39,927
- Then whom should I?
- Our village leader

288
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:41,429
Village Leader?

289
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:50,938
- Where is the village leader?
- He is in the village

290
00:26:51,063 --> 00:26:52,565
Won't he come?

291
00:26:52,648 --> 00:26:54,150
He passed away

292
00:26:54,817 --> 00:26:56,569
What are you speaking?

293
00:26:56,652 --> 00:26:59,113
You want me to take
a dead body photo

294
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:02,450
Which village are you from?
Camera has its own respect

295
00:27:02,617 --> 00:27:06,746
This week alone, we have 4
marriages, 3 shop openings

296
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:09,665
Have got lot of work to do

297
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:11,709
But, it's alright!

298
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:16,339
- Which village are you from?
- Mundasupatti

299
00:27:19,091 --> 00:27:23,179
It's the next stop from
our Landlord's place

300
00:27:23,262 --> 00:27:27,683
A little far away,
But I'll come for your sake

301
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:28,851
O Kay

302
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:32,188
What is he saying master?

303
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:36,025
Village leader has passed away
So we need to take a photo of him

304
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:38,903
Do you know his experience
and reputation?

305
00:27:38,986 --> 00:27:40,988
I took the advance amount

306
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:45,284
Have some tea, sir

307
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:55,294
Good, in your village
you take photos even after death

308
00:27:55,378 --> 00:27:57,296
We only take
photos after death

309
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,339
Why is it so?

310
00:27:58,422 --> 00:28:02,802
If we take photo when we are alive,
We'll die because of some disease

311
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:07,807
Englishmen satellites are taking
photographs of the entire earth

312
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,936
Ohh! That's why we are not getting
adequate rain in our village

313
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:13,938
If you want rain,
Grow some trees

314
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:16,315
What is the connection
between rain and tree?

315
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,818
- 'French Connection'
- What is he saying?

316
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:20,903
He says connection
in such an accent

317
00:28:20,986 --> 00:28:23,698
They won't listen even
if MGR comes and advice

318
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:32,998
- Are we going very slow?
- We are going really slow

319
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:36,252
Photographers have come

320
00:28:42,258 --> 00:28:46,512
Why the village looks deserted?
Has everyone gone to the funeral?

321
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:57,690
Keep that photo box inside
Otherwise it's a trouble

322
00:28:57,732 --> 00:29:02,027
No need to fear,
the photo box is inside only

323
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:04,488
Welcome

324
00:29:04,572 --> 00:29:07,783
- Why there was a delay?
- Bike was bit slow

325
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:10,745
For that you could
have come by walk

326
00:29:14,081 --> 00:29:16,292
Being sarcastic

327
00:29:17,877 --> 00:29:19,754
Bend and come

328
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:23,174
He is the leader of
Mundasupatti village

329
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:24,842
- Greetings
- Greetings to you

330
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:28,220
There is a small issue

331
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:31,724
Sir, is not dead yet
Can die anytime from now

332
00:29:31,766 --> 00:29:35,186
- Then why did you call us
- We thought he would be dead by now

333
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:36,645
What's wrong with you?

334
00:29:36,729 --> 00:29:41,150
Don't get angry his time is over,
he should die in a few minutes from now

335
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:45,446
Is he an Indian Airways flight
to take off in a few minutes?

336
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:48,657
Let's take a photo now,
At least we'll save time

337
00:29:48,741 --> 00:29:51,535
You are trying to take
a photo and kill him

338
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:52,703
Hey don't frustrate me

339
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:55,539
He is half dead already,
why should we kill him?

340
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:58,125
- You...?
- Calm down

341
00:29:58,209 --> 00:29:59,710
Are you threatening us?

342
00:29:59,794 --> 00:30:04,006
Master give back
the advance and let's leave

343
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:05,549
Don't irritate us

344
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:09,220
Do you think we don't have
any other work to do?

345
00:30:22,316 --> 00:30:26,320
"Like the sweetness of water
that springs through the well"

346
00:30:26,403 --> 00:30:30,157
"The ecstatic feel of love
for you passes through me"

347
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:37,373
"Every sip of it takes
my breath away"

348
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:41,794
Even if it takes a decade,
we'll take the photo and leave

349
00:30:41,877 --> 00:30:48,759
"With expectations mounting
All I face is disappointment"

350
00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:56,433
"I wonder why a good sleep
Has become a far friend"

351
00:30:57,268 --> 00:31:04,775
"I am uncomfortable
I burn within...l fall...l cry"

352
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:11,907
"You've taken my heart away"

353
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:19,874
Look here boys, this is
my great great grandfather

354
00:31:19,957 --> 00:31:21,292
Great grandfather

355
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:22,710
Grandmother

356
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,086
My mother

357
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:27,423
At last grandfather

358
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:32,720
This is the last photo
captured in our village

359
00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:35,973
All of them in the photo
died because of a disease

360
00:31:36,056 --> 00:31:40,895
From then we never take
a photo when we are alive

361
00:31:42,313 --> 00:31:44,398
All because of Englishman

362
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:48,402
During my father's days, Englishman
had come and took photographs

363
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:52,531
All who posed for the photo
died because of some diseases

364
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:53,949
It doesn't stop there

365
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:57,828
During my great grandfather days,
thieves have come to snatch our idol

366
00:31:57,912 --> 00:32:04,460
Because of spirit of the sky only our
villagers lead a peaceful and contented lite

367
00:32:04,627 --> 00:32:08,923
In fact India got independence
because of spirit of the sky

368
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,636
Hey Sudamani, come here

369
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:17,890
He is my son Sudamani

370
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,558
Should have seen
him in the path

371
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:22,770
Yeah we saw him,
producing manures

372
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:34,782
This is my daughter Kalaivani

373
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:38,202
She is the only girl from
Mundasupatti, who went to school

374
00:32:38,285 --> 00:32:40,037
Looking at her horoscope...

375
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,456
...fortune teller said
she needs to go to school

376
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,667
For that reason
I sent her to school

377
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,045
Now it's her marriage,
so she quit the school

378
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:51,966
- When is the marriage?
- We have postponed it for a while

379
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:53,425
Postponed it!

380
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,012
Postponed it?

381
00:32:57,096 --> 00:32:58,681
Don't ask about it

382
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:03,560
Last week a thunder struck our spirit
of the sky temple and did few damages

383
00:33:03,727 --> 00:33:07,856
Without rectifying that, we wouldn't
do any functions in our village

384
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,317
That's why we have
postponed the marriage

385
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:13,529
We should do the amends
that's why the temple being locked

386
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,086
Sudamani, stop this,
they are scared

387
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:30,671
Crazy brother-in-law you've got

388
00:33:30,754 --> 00:33:33,048
- Greetings uncle
- Welcome groom

389
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:35,718
He is my to be Son-in-law

390
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:37,177
He is Shanmugam

391
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:38,887
Greet you

392
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,058
Have bought a saree
for Kalaivani

393
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:44,643
IS it?

394
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:48,564
Kalaivani, come get the saree

395
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:53,110
Go, collect the saree

396
00:33:56,488 --> 00:33:58,866
Don't you hear
them calling you?

397
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,034
Go

398
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:18,802
Uncle, workers have come

399
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:20,721
Wait for a minute
I'll come

400
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:21,764
O Kay

401
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:28,187
Still angry with groom?

402
00:34:29,188 --> 00:34:33,859
You stopped my education,
just because he asked you to

403
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:36,987
By this time my friends
would have wrote the exams

404
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:40,574
At last I didn't get
to meet them too

405
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:43,452
Just for rituals,
we sent you to the school

406
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:46,997
Groom said it's not required,
Then what's your problem

407
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:52,127
Guruji is coming,
Guruji is coming

408
00:35:37,923 --> 00:35:39,800
Live a long-life

409
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:03,615
Just stop whining,
give this milk to grandpa

410
00:36:17,004 --> 00:36:20,007
Master, just go and propose
your love for her

411
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:24,803
Her grandpa is in death bed,
Now you want me to propose

412
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:28,307
- Then he'll get up and slap me
- Just go, master

413
00:36:28,557 --> 00:36:30,934
Hey don't push me,
lam nervous

414
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:35,856
Just go

415
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:44,156
If your grandpa dies...

416
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,825
...hope he'll be seated here
for a photo, right?

417
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,621
Propose her

418
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:01,548
Hope he doesn't like milk

419
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:05,719
Because it just
comes out of his mouth

420
00:37:06,178 --> 00:37:08,305
You don't know
how to give it

421
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,807
Give it, I'll teach you

422
00:37:14,686 --> 00:37:15,938
Just give it

423
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:17,606
- No
- Give it

424
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:20,317
Just look now

425
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:23,111
Have to hold tight,
open the mouth...

426
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:24,571
...and pour it down

427
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,073
Like this

428
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,290
How is it?

429
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:40,003
Grandpa wants to say something

430
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:41,838
Speak out grandpa

431
00:37:56,645 --> 00:38:00,274
Seeing the way you proposed her
even the grandpa spat on you face

432
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:02,401
Do you want to have a soda?

433
00:38:03,235 --> 00:38:05,320
Hey move and sit down

434
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:09,574
Is this an age to eat this snack?

435
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:16,873
Everyone in this
village looks like a fool

436
00:38:20,294 --> 00:38:23,755
Why is that in every door
it's written 'Go back'?

437
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,841
Is that to notify
the relatives to leave

438
00:38:25,924 --> 00:38:27,342
Don't mean that

439
00:38:27,426 --> 00:38:31,638
In the midnight vampires come
and stand in front of our homes

440
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:35,684
Reading this, they
won't enter our homes

441
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:40,897
Even vampires know to read but
these buggers didn't go to school

442
00:38:40,981 --> 00:38:42,149
What happened?

443
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:44,735
At last the thief
is caught red handed

444
00:38:44,818 --> 00:38:47,112
- Come all of you
- Is the thief get caught?

445
00:38:49,323 --> 00:38:51,450
Wait guys, I'll come back

446
00:38:55,746 --> 00:38:58,040
Sir, early morning he was
roaming near the temple

447
00:38:58,123 --> 00:39:00,042
He started running
the moment he saw me

448
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,044
He is not opening his mouth
how much ever we beat him

449
00:39:02,127 --> 00:39:03,503
These guys need a good beating

450
00:39:03,587 --> 00:39:04,504
Just Beating?

451
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:06,590
Wait and see
what is gonna happen

452
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:10,385
Guruji is coming

453
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:16,641
He has come

454
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:18,518
Why is he staring at us?

455
00:39:19,561 --> 00:39:22,272
Uncle, let's punish him
as per our village rules

456
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:24,399
Only then others will fear
to do anything like this

457
00:39:24,483 --> 00:39:26,360
Punishments for theft?

458
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:31,114
Lord, shall we seek permission
from Spirit of the sky?

459
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:34,368
Oh God!

460
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:38,205
Hey, bring the temple bell

461
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:15,325
The guru has hung the bell

462
00:40:16,868 --> 00:40:20,872
When the lord
is there to feed us...

463
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:24,209
...why suffer by doing wrong?

464
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:27,212
The lord punishes
the wrong with a nose break...

465
00:40:27,295 --> 00:40:30,132
...the infidel by
stopping the breath

466
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:33,385
For those who refuse to listen to the lord,
change the very nature of the being

467
00:40:33,427 --> 00:40:37,597
...for that infidel creature,
give us your orders

468
00:40:37,681 --> 00:40:40,517
Oh lord Spirit of the sky

469
00:40:47,524 --> 00:40:49,401
All women and children
leave immediately

470
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:51,570
Leave...leave soon

471
00:40:51,653 --> 00:40:53,780
Are they gonna undress?

472
00:40:58,452 --> 00:41:01,163
Break his bones like that,
will he do any wrong again?

473
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:09,588
They broke the hand because
a bell tolled due to the wind

474
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:12,340
Master, we are rushing back home

475
00:41:12,424 --> 00:41:15,218
We will finalise the horoscope
we got from Udumalaipet

476
00:41:15,302 --> 00:41:16,678
You scared?

477
00:41:17,095 --> 00:41:19,306
Once you fall in love...

478
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:23,935
...you shouldn't fear even if your
hand breaks or your leg breaks

479
00:41:24,644 --> 00:41:28,940
Don't worry, I shall
save you at all cost

480
00:41:29,024 --> 00:41:30,609
Hey photographer

481
00:41:33,111 --> 00:41:35,697
Master, no

482
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:37,741
Please tell me

483
00:41:39,743 --> 00:41:40,952
Tell me

484
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:42,871
- Master
- Wait

485
00:41:42,954 --> 00:41:44,664
That is...

486
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:48,043
I want to take a photo

487
00:41:48,126 --> 00:41:50,462
Surprising, you have changed suddenly

488
00:41:50,545 --> 00:41:55,050
She has gone to school right,
she would have become open minded

489
00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:57,594
Close up shot or full size?

490
00:41:58,303 --> 00:42:00,514
- Not me
- Then?

491
00:42:04,476 --> 00:42:07,437
- This one
- This?

492
00:42:08,438 --> 00:42:11,608
In your town, anything that is
photographed will die right?

493
00:42:11,816 --> 00:42:14,319
Even this will die tomorrow

494
00:42:14,402 --> 00:42:17,322
because, tomorrow this will be
served as a feast

495
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:18,698
Biriyani, is it?

496
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,537
This is my favourite goat

497
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,164
That's why I want it photographed

498
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:28,500
You know it's name?

499
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:31,795
- Subramani
- Subramani?

500
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,509
Okay, tie it to the tree

501
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,564
Hey, where is that girl?

502
00:42:53,858 --> 00:42:55,986
Subramani, don't move

503
00:42:56,194 --> 00:42:58,738
Smile once for the last time

504
00:42:59,948 --> 00:43:02,909
- Have you taken the photo?
- Yes, please come

505
00:43:02,993 --> 00:43:05,745
Okay, please put the camera inside

506
00:43:28,852 --> 00:43:33,189
Please don't tell this to anyone
If my father knows, he'll kill me

507
00:43:33,773 --> 00:43:34,983
I'll try

508
00:43:35,984 --> 00:43:40,614
Then I don't have money for the photo

509
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:43,575
That's alright!
Don't worry

510
00:43:44,701 --> 00:43:46,661
Okay, I'll take leave

511
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,126
Master, in the name of 'Hollywood Studio',
is it fair to take photos of goats?

512
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,589
I saw such a passion in your eyes
That's why I asked

513
00:44:01,259 --> 00:44:02,802
You, come here

514
00:44:02,886 --> 00:44:06,306
- Is he calling us?
- It seems like a graveyard

515
00:44:08,016 --> 00:44:10,602
Are you the people who came to
photograph the old man?

516
00:44:10,644 --> 00:44:11,519
Yes

517
00:44:11,603 --> 00:44:15,815
The localities don't come this side or
they never speak to me

518
00:44:15,899 --> 00:44:18,777
Since I saw new faces, I felt
like talking to you, hence I called

519
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,488
Sir, will anybody come to
the graveyard to talk?

520
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:25,867
It's not just because of graveyard
You see the old building there

521
00:44:27,077 --> 00:44:28,411
Yes

522
00:44:30,205 --> 00:44:33,124
20 years ago, that was the village school

523
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:36,086
School?
In this village?

524
00:44:36,169 --> 00:44:38,755
Yes, hearing the foolishness
of this village people...

525
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:41,424
...Kamarajar built
a school for them

526
00:44:41,508 --> 00:44:44,636
But, not even a soul came
once to this school

527
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:45,679
Why so?

528
00:44:45,762 --> 00:44:48,264
2 guys from the village
drank spurious liquor

529
00:44:48,348 --> 00:44:51,142
from somewhere and went
to sleep in the school

530
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:54,729
Next morning, they were lying dead
coughing a lot of blood

531
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:57,065
Isn't this sufficient
for the village elders?

532
00:44:57,148 --> 00:45:00,276
They spread rumors saying
it was act of satan

533
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,988
From that day, fearing the satan
no one comes this side at all

534
00:45:04,072 --> 00:45:06,700
Wonder when they'll come good

535
00:45:11,496 --> 00:45:13,415
- Hey Ganesa
- Yes, sir

536
00:45:13,498 --> 00:45:15,875
Somehow you got the stone
You are very smart

537
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:18,670
Yes sir, this is child's play

538
00:45:18,753 --> 00:45:20,880
Which this for your child's play?

539
00:45:21,423 --> 00:45:24,592
What is that Ganesa, you have kept
your hand in the cradle?

540
00:45:25,343 --> 00:45:29,973
That I had to fight 4 people
when getting the stone

541
00:45:30,056 --> 00:45:33,852
You...4 people
you beat them?

542
00:45:33,935 --> 00:45:35,854
That's why your hand is like that?

543
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,862
Why is the color fading?

544
00:45:43,945 --> 00:45:48,366
Sir forgive me
In my fear I lied

545
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:57,667
Hey Ganesa, you are just a stone villain,
I'm a strong and long villain tell me

546
00:45:58,042 --> 00:46:01,212
Sir, you are asking and
he is just blabbering

547
00:46:01,296 --> 00:46:02,922
Shoot him in his mouth, sir

548
00:46:04,507 --> 00:46:10,013
When there is a gun in the mouth,
you speak let's see

549
00:46:10,096 --> 00:46:12,348
Go get me a hot soup!

550
00:46:12,557 --> 00:46:15,351
Sir, we can't take the stone
that easily as you think

551
00:46:15,435 --> 00:46:18,938
The lock of temple is like that
I've never seen such a lock in my service

552
00:46:19,022 --> 00:46:22,192
Very old look looks like
Very strong lock, sir

553
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:27,989
Let my hand heal sir,
I'll take the stone definitely

554
00:46:28,072 --> 00:46:31,326
The stone should not be
lifted Ganesa, you should be lifted

555
00:46:32,285 --> 00:46:33,453
Idiot

556
00:46:33,536 --> 00:46:34,788
Come this side

557
00:46:35,246 --> 00:46:37,165
- What did you do?
- I placed the soup

558
00:46:37,248 --> 00:46:39,250
Will you keep like that?

559
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:41,628
Idiots

560
00:46:41,753 --> 00:46:44,506
Ask them to get stone,
they get some nonsense

561
00:46:44,589 --> 00:46:46,299
They've got something

562
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:48,968
Cardboard, is it?

563
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:51,262
You cunny fellow!

564
00:47:01,689 --> 00:47:04,192
They don't know it's a meteor
and they pray it as God

565
00:47:04,275 --> 00:47:07,946
Meteor or washing stone, they are
going to pray at something as God

566
00:47:08,029 --> 00:47:09,072
Long live

567
00:47:09,155 --> 00:47:11,658
Will they research it otherwise?

568
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:13,701
Shut up and come

569
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:16,663
- What kids? Have you prayed?
- Yes, yes

570
00:47:17,622 --> 00:47:20,333
What sir, everyone is sitting?
Are they serving food?

571
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:24,629
Food? No, for long life,
they are waiting to put flowers

572
00:47:24,712 --> 00:47:27,006
If you want, I'll get
a seat for you

573
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:30,051
- Are you not putting flowers?
- I did it last year itself

574
00:47:30,134 --> 00:47:34,305
In our village, fire walk is called
flower walk, similarly here too

575
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:38,643
No son, we never do such,
the legs will hurt right

576
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:40,478
It will affect our work

577
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,897
Your village people are very good

578
00:47:42,981 --> 00:47:46,025
- Please sit! Okay sit there
- This side, is it?

579
00:47:47,777 --> 00:47:49,988
Photographer is coming with a flower

580
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:54,242
- Keep quiet
- Please give me pongal

581
00:47:54,325 --> 00:47:58,872
This is only for people who put flowers
Else we won't give anyone

582
00:47:58,955 --> 00:48:03,209
- You put the flowers and give me pongal
- No, please put the flowers and come

583
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:08,214
Why are you not answering anything?

584
00:48:09,716 --> 00:48:11,634
Are they going to cut my hair?

585
00:48:11,718 --> 00:48:14,012
Pray well!

586
00:48:37,118 --> 00:48:39,746
The coconut hit not only my skull,
my brain too

587
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:40,747
That's okay come

588
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:44,125
- Master, then okay
- They are serving pongal there

589
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,838
Now give please

590
00:48:50,506 --> 00:48:52,175
For me?

591
00:48:52,675 --> 00:48:56,179
Please see the head,
The damage is huge

592
00:48:56,262 --> 00:48:58,640
Can't you give one more pongal free?

593
00:48:58,723 --> 00:49:03,102
No, it will become a blasphemy,
put flowers and come, I'll give

594
00:49:03,186 --> 00:49:06,230
These flowers are sufficient,
we can make a garland

595
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:12,654
- I've put flowers 6 times you?
- I've put 10 times

596
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:21,371
Seems like kid has a soft skull,
that's why he's bleeding

597
00:49:30,088 --> 00:49:33,466
Please don't tell anyone about
photographing the goat

598
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:41,391
Sir, since your daughter asked,
I got it

599
00:49:42,308 --> 00:49:44,102
Kalaivani, come here

600
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:48,481
Is it true what he's saying?

601
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:51,651
No,dad

602
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:53,027
How many times to say

603
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:55,738
If anything happens
it is not good for God

604
00:49:56,406 --> 00:49:59,242
That since it was my favourite

605
00:49:59,325 --> 00:50:02,120
When I say don't grace near
the well, won't you listen

606
00:50:02,578 --> 00:50:05,415
Since he was there, he saved the goat
from jumping into the well

607
00:50:05,498 --> 00:50:08,251
If we feast on a hurt goat,
it is not good for God

608
00:50:08,334 --> 00:50:11,004
Don't you know this?
Okay, go

609
00:50:17,468 --> 00:50:21,556
Is this our Subramani?
Can't recognize him?

610
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:27,562
Son, need a small help

611
00:50:28,312 --> 00:50:32,150
Need to take a photo,
don't tell our chief

612
00:50:32,775 --> 00:50:36,154
I'll show a woman,
please take a photo of her

613
00:50:36,446 --> 00:50:38,322
I'm not able to bear her torture

614
00:50:38,406 --> 00:50:42,285
If she opens her mouth,
it'll be unbearable to listen to her

615
00:50:42,368 --> 00:50:45,038
Only you should help
to close this

616
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:51,127
But in your village, if you
take photo they will die, right?

617
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,962
That's why I am asking you to help

618
00:50:53,046 --> 00:50:56,841
If she dies of any disease,
nobody will doubt me, right?

619
00:50:57,091 --> 00:51:00,762
- Why should anybody doubt you?
- She is my wife, son

620
00:51:00,845 --> 00:51:06,726
Please keep this as an advance,
I'll give you the balance after the photo

621
00:51:15,068 --> 00:51:18,029
Son, need a help

622
00:51:18,112 --> 00:51:20,031
What? Do you need a photo?

623
00:51:20,573 --> 00:51:21,699
Of whom?

624
00:51:21,783 --> 00:51:25,495
My husband only, he is
always beating me

625
00:51:25,578 --> 00:51:29,040
He'll be here somewhere,
please take a photo of him

626
00:51:29,123 --> 00:51:30,792
Keep this

627
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:36,380
The guy who is standing there
It's him

628
00:51:36,714 --> 00:51:38,633
That rose shirt, is it?

629
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:43,012
That is Palanisamy, don't
do anything to him please

630
00:51:43,805 --> 00:51:48,351
The big moustache guy
next to him is my husband

631
00:51:48,434 --> 00:51:54,023
Please ensure he dies in a week
You will be blessed

632
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:00,029
Hey these guys are
making me a mercenary

633
00:52:00,113 --> 00:52:01,447
This is a good business master

634
00:52:01,531 --> 00:52:03,199
You'll get from me

635
00:52:07,537 --> 00:52:09,705
- Thanks
- Why?

636
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:12,125
I was afraid
you'll tell my father

637
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:13,793
That was for fun

638
00:52:15,503 --> 00:52:16,671
Just a minute

639
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:22,426
Please take this

640
00:52:33,813 --> 00:52:35,898
You still have this?

641
00:52:36,482 --> 00:52:38,109
She too...such an idiot

642
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:40,778
I love you

643
00:52:45,992 --> 00:52:50,705
- Sir! Sir!
- Oh my god

644
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:56,586
Good omen, man

645
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:12,602
"You are our king of kings"

646
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:17,440
"Where has your kingdom vanished?"

647
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:22,778
"You lived through our eyes
Where have you left us"

648
00:53:22,862 --> 00:53:27,658
"Oh king of kings!"

649
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:32,371
"You are our Queen of queens"

650
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:37,084
"The one who took the breath away"

651
00:53:38,377 --> 00:53:42,590
"I've whispered our desires
through your ears"

652
00:53:42,673 --> 00:53:43,466
'I love you'

653
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:47,845
"You are the queen of nectars"

654
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:30,513
"The words that you uttered"

655
00:54:31,013 --> 00:54:35,726
"The struggle you went through"

656
00:54:36,477 --> 00:54:41,440
"You're my life
Rise up"

657
00:54:41,524 --> 00:54:46,404
"My king of kings"

658
00:54:46,487 --> 00:54:50,866
"Come for me"

659
00:54:51,158 --> 00:54:55,997
"Give me a space in your heart"

660
00:54:56,747 --> 00:55:01,502
"A word with you
A life with you"

661
00:55:01,627 --> 00:55:06,257
"You and I are a destiny"

662
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:08,968
Take his photo, sir

663
00:55:27,528 --> 00:55:29,947
Our chief should look like a lion
in the photo

664
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:32,825
For a lion, you should go to the forest

665
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:39,332
Chief, here is your weapon

666
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:43,669
Our chief will always be
with the weapon

667
00:55:45,338 --> 00:55:46,922
You take the photo

668
00:55:50,051 --> 00:55:51,927
Give me the camera man

669
00:56:11,364 --> 00:56:13,366
Hey, where have all of them gone?

670
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:18,454
You take son,
we'll keep talking outside

671
00:56:18,704 --> 00:56:21,207
Our village people are very clever, right?

672
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,292
You saw how they managed it?

673
00:56:35,513 --> 00:56:38,140
"Time flies when I wait for you"

674
00:56:38,224 --> 00:56:43,062
"I fly in happiness when I wait for you
To be with you always!"

675
00:56:43,145 --> 00:56:47,858
"History will speak of us, Our relationship
is beyond conditions and reasons"

676
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:50,361
"Worries farther from me
when I am with you"

677
00:56:50,403 --> 00:56:54,490
"Our Love is contagious"

678
00:56:55,282 --> 00:56:59,662
"Never will it leave us"

679
00:57:00,746 --> 00:57:05,584
"it will bind our bodies
It will rock our world"

680
00:57:05,835 --> 00:57:10,756
"Love is not an easy-go-feel"

681
00:57:13,717 --> 00:57:18,931
"I came to sing love duet ever"

682
00:57:19,932 --> 00:57:21,934
Master, photo ready

683
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:28,566
They have brought the photo!

684
00:57:32,445 --> 00:57:34,738
Great! You have done a good job

685
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:37,616
- Hey, ask everyone to come and see
- Okay sir

686
00:57:53,716 --> 00:57:58,095
"You have to come for me"

687
00:57:58,179 --> 00:58:03,184
"Let me into your heart"

688
00:58:03,642 --> 00:58:08,814
"I am living this life
Just for your love"

689
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:13,777
"So we can live this life happily"

690
00:58:16,572 --> 00:58:18,949
Please ask someone to bring water

691
00:58:24,622 --> 00:58:26,207
What son, was the food okay?

692
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:28,459
It seems he ate too much vada(snacks)

693
00:58:30,169 --> 00:58:33,380
Very happy son, I can give
whatever you ask

694
00:58:35,341 --> 00:58:37,009
That is...

695
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:42,097
I want to marry your daughter

696
00:58:43,641 --> 00:58:45,935
Why are you feeling shy about it?

697
00:58:46,018 --> 00:58:48,103
I thought it was something very big

698
00:58:48,187 --> 00:58:53,317
To give my daughter to an educated,
photographer like you will I refuse?

699
00:58:53,526 --> 00:58:56,570
Kalaivani, do you like the groom?

700
00:58:58,531 --> 00:59:03,661
Then what you wondering I agreed so
easily I know everything, son

701
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:08,415
Come, let's ask permission from
spirit of the sky and come back

702
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:10,042
- Master, all the best
- Go man

703
00:59:11,585 --> 00:59:14,255
Kalaivani, come here

704
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:16,507
Sit down

705
00:59:24,223 --> 00:59:27,601
- Brother, everything is spoilt
- Brother?

706
00:59:27,893 --> 00:59:30,396
Brother, photo did
not expose correctly

707
00:59:30,563 --> 00:59:31,981
Photo?

708
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:37,403
"My sib is sleeping like a bud"

709
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:39,822
Boss, come here soon

710
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:43,117
What?

711
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,454
Everything's spoilt, film didn't
expose well, the old man's face is not clear

712
00:59:48,414 --> 00:59:51,250
Just now we took consent
from Kalaivani's father, right?

713
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:53,335
Hey! See what happened

714
00:59:53,419 --> 00:59:56,255
Just now I washed the film,
he took consent it seems

715
00:59:57,256 --> 00:59:59,508
Hey, my love is dependent on this

716
00:59:59,592 --> 01:00:01,010
Our hands and legs are
dependent on this

717
01:00:01,093 --> 01:00:03,304
they'll break our bones
if we don't give the photo

718
01:00:03,971 --> 01:00:06,765
We'll dig out the body and
take the photo again

719
01:00:11,854 --> 01:00:14,523
What son?
Did you forget anything?

720
01:00:14,607 --> 01:00:15,899
What did you do to the chief?

721
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:19,695
- As per our tradition, we usually bury him
- Then we can take the photo

722
01:00:19,778 --> 01:00:22,656
- But this time, we burned the body
- You burned him, is it?

723
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,909
Yes son, only then we can throw
his ashes all over the village

724
01:00:25,993 --> 01:00:28,746
As per his wish see, we are
throwing the ashes everywhere

725
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:31,999
Only little is left, I'll throw these ashes
and come back

726
01:00:37,087 --> 01:00:39,256
As if these guys are the Nehru family

727
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:43,719
If their ashes are spread across India,
as if there'll be so much harvest

728
01:00:44,762 --> 01:00:47,723
Son, the village is waiting for
the chief's photo

729
01:00:47,806 --> 01:00:48,766
Has it come well?

730
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:51,352
Yes, it has come out very well

731
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:57,775
Shall we give 'Missing' notice for
both of us in the local newspaper

732
01:00:58,192 --> 01:01:01,779
Looks like we got to burn the roof
and go back to our native

733
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:05,407
Master! An idea

734
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:09,161
Shall we burn the studio and say
even the photograph got burned

735
01:01:09,244 --> 01:01:10,954
Don't give stupid ideas!

736
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:13,248
Can we burn the studio fearing them?

737
01:01:14,124 --> 01:01:17,920
If the studio burns, we can say the photos
got burned and get their sympathy

738
01:01:18,003 --> 01:01:20,673
Saying this, we can
meet Kalaivani also

739
01:01:21,924 --> 01:01:24,176
All that is going to burn
is few papers and films

740
01:01:24,259 --> 01:01:26,387
Leave it to me!
I'll handle this

741
01:01:26,762 --> 01:01:29,264
See in the morning,
now just sleep

742
01:01:32,685 --> 01:01:35,771
As the candle burns and
comes near this string

743
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:40,025
it will fall on the paper below
and will burn entirely

744
01:01:40,109 --> 01:01:42,528
Hey, when did you learn all this?

745
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:45,781
When I'm alone in the studio,
I've thought a lot like this

746
01:01:45,864 --> 01:01:49,660
I have written in a notebook,
I'll share if need be

747
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:53,455
We'll switch off the main board,
only then fire won't spread

748
01:01:54,998 --> 01:01:57,292
Hey tea shop, saloon,
we are going for a movie

749
01:01:57,376 --> 01:01:59,086
If anyone comes, ask
them to come tomorrow

750
01:01:59,169 --> 01:02:01,505
Hey Saravana,
Ravi, did you hear?

751
01:02:01,588 --> 01:02:06,844
Why do you resort to violence?

752
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:09,972
Brother, the shop has
burnt, come fast

753
01:02:10,055 --> 01:02:11,682
Success Alagu
Come

754
01:02:11,765 --> 01:02:13,642
We should drink tea on the way

755
01:02:13,726 --> 01:02:16,520
Master, keep your face sad
as if there is a big loss

756
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:17,938
Get down

757
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:21,233
Oh my shop, my studio is burning

758
01:02:21,734 --> 01:02:24,153
We set fire to our shop, right?

759
01:02:25,696 --> 01:02:28,115
What this guy is coming from inside?

760
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:32,619
I came to get my photo
A fire started from the tea shop

761
01:02:32,828 --> 01:02:35,414
I broke the lock and
extinguished the fire

762
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:37,708
Good thing, the main was switched off

763
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:42,045
Else my photo too would
have burnt down in the fire

764
01:02:44,465 --> 01:02:46,383
He is the root cause for this

765
01:02:46,467 --> 01:02:48,969
He is not Ezhumalai
He is Yeman

766
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:59,146
Sir, where is your notebook?

767
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,108
I have another idea also

768
01:03:03,192 --> 01:03:05,402
Your idea is not required, shut up

769
01:03:05,486 --> 01:03:08,155
Brother, my photo?

770
01:03:18,415 --> 01:03:19,792
Thank God!

771
01:03:40,062 --> 01:03:42,856
What Gopi?
Are you fine?

772
01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:47,528
1...2...3

773
01:03:48,612 --> 01:03:51,031
- Say one Tea
- Tea?

774
01:03:54,952 --> 01:03:57,037
Here's the money you asked for

775
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,666
You insulted me for this, right?
Come and take my photo

776
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:03,252
- You have not changed is it?
- Never

777
01:04:03,836 --> 01:04:06,046
I've earned this money
cleaning cow dung

778
01:04:06,129 --> 01:04:09,550
Not only that, there's
another important thing

779
01:04:09,633 --> 01:04:13,262
After the month of Thai, there'll be
3 guys on top in Tamil cinema

780
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:16,723
One is Rajinikanth,
other is Kamal Hassan...

781
01:04:16,807 --> 01:04:19,101
...and the third is Munishkanth

782
01:04:19,852 --> 01:04:22,187
- Who is that Munishkanth?
- It's me!

783
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,606
The astrologer has told me

784
01:04:25,399 --> 01:04:28,068
What is the use banging
on the radio now?

785
01:04:28,151 --> 01:04:30,237
Please come
and take photo fast

786
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,447
How many hurdles
before one comes to top?

787
01:04:32,531 --> 01:04:33,907
Take his snap
and send him out

788
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:35,701
You insulted me
for five rupees-

789
01:04:35,784 --> 01:04:39,872
You will take photos of school girls,
I should take photos of this joker, is it?

790
01:04:45,085 --> 01:04:48,255
- Master,
- What?

791
01:04:48,338 --> 01:04:50,048
Come here soon

792
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:54,928
Hey, what man?

793
01:04:55,012 --> 01:04:56,597
Watch him closely

794
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,808
As if he is a glamour queen,
to watch him close

795
01:05:02,853 --> 01:05:05,772
Can't you see the face cut
of the dead body?

796
01:05:17,868 --> 01:05:23,582
Yes Alagumani, he looks just like
the dead body we took a photo of

797
01:06:08,251 --> 01:06:11,213
Do you want tea or juice?

798
01:06:12,756 --> 01:06:15,342
What Gopi, suddenly so much care?

799
01:06:16,927 --> 01:06:18,637
- Munishkanth
- Yes

800
01:06:19,471 --> 01:06:22,474
Acting is a penance

801
01:06:22,641 --> 01:06:25,686
That penance is seen
on your face clearly

802
01:06:25,769 --> 01:06:28,981
What man, you are
calling my face a frog?

803
01:06:29,064 --> 01:06:30,315
Is it look like that?

804
01:06:30,399 --> 01:06:31,900
See and say again, Gopi

805
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:36,863
Just a minute

806
01:06:37,489 --> 01:06:38,156
Hello

807
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,366
Master, Alagumani speaking

808
01:06:39,449 --> 01:06:40,617
Please tell me

809
01:06:40,701 --> 01:06:42,953
The dead body has come
to us, don't leave it

810
01:06:43,036 --> 01:06:43,745
IS it?

811
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:46,373
Hope you remember
what we spoke in dark room

812
01:06:46,456 --> 01:06:49,042
- For that role?
- You got it

813
01:06:49,126 --> 01:06:51,420
- Just talk about Bharathiraja
- For his movie?

814
01:06:51,503 --> 01:06:53,255
That's a great opportunity

815
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:55,424
He would look at you agape

816
01:06:55,507 --> 01:06:58,468
- I'll hang the phone
- Will let you know soon

817
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:01,847
Do come home
when you come here

818
01:07:04,558 --> 01:07:07,477
My friend works as an
assistant for Bharathiraja

819
01:07:07,561 --> 01:07:09,354
Oh Bharathiraja!

820
01:07:11,356 --> 01:07:14,401
- Sir, tea
- Did you have?

821
01:07:14,484 --> 01:07:15,610
Yes

822
01:07:17,112 --> 01:07:21,199
Hey Alagumani, Bharathiraja is
gonna shoot a movie in our place

823
01:07:21,283 --> 01:07:23,952
They need someone
to act as a dead body

824
01:07:24,036 --> 01:07:26,079
Do we someone who can act?

825
01:07:26,288 --> 01:07:27,581
- Brother
- Wait

826
01:07:27,664 --> 01:07:29,708
Our meat shop brother

827
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:32,961
He has got a crooked face,
he won't fit this role

828
01:07:33,045 --> 01:07:34,421
- Guys?
- Wait

829
01:07:34,504 --> 01:07:36,048
How about soda shop Saravanan?

830
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:39,009
- He can never cover his teeth
- Sir, one minute

831
01:07:39,092 --> 01:07:41,386
How about petty
shop Murugaesan?

832
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:44,347
Why do you bother when I'm here?

833
01:07:44,431 --> 01:07:47,059
You didn't even consider me

834
01:07:47,142 --> 01:07:50,270
I thought you wanna be a hero

835
01:07:50,353 --> 01:07:55,108
I don't mind to be a dead body
in Bharathiraja's film

836
01:07:55,192 --> 01:07:57,277
- Sure?
- Yes, I am

837
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,695
He should be fine then

838
01:07:58,779 --> 01:08:00,197
Is he okay?

839
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,156
It's okay

840
01:08:06,161 --> 01:08:08,747
Now we have to take a photo
shoot like a dead body

841
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:13,168
If Bharathiraja sees this,
You are the one to act

842
01:08:13,251 --> 01:08:14,377
Sure

843
01:08:47,744 --> 01:08:50,580
So Munishkanth
is gonna rock in the film

844
01:08:50,664 --> 01:08:52,415
Don't praise me

845
01:08:54,376 --> 01:08:57,254
You have given light
in my life Gopi

846
01:08:57,337 --> 01:08:59,297
That's alright

847
01:08:59,422 --> 01:09:02,759
But you turned out to be
the character during the photo shoot

848
01:09:02,843 --> 01:09:04,761
That's the big stuff

849
01:09:06,388 --> 01:09:08,140
- Enough praising
- Excellent

850
01:09:09,432 --> 01:09:12,018
Photo looks extremely good

851
01:09:13,478 --> 01:09:16,398
He poses like Mundasupatti lion

852
01:09:16,481 --> 01:09:17,607
Exactly

853
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,986
Why don't you call
everyone to see this?

854
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:23,572
Kalaivani, come and see
your grandpa's photo

855
01:09:23,655 --> 01:09:25,323
Hmmm, call her

856
01:09:30,829 --> 01:09:33,248
Photographer has done
a wonderful job

857
01:09:42,674 --> 01:09:44,092
Go and show it to everyone

858
01:09:44,176 --> 01:09:46,678
Kalaivani still mourns
for her grandpa

859
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:47,721
I know

860
01:09:47,804 --> 01:09:50,432
They only killed him
by giving milk

861
01:09:52,434 --> 01:09:58,648
Hereafter he is the photographer
for any death in Mundasupatti

862
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:00,275
Give it to me

863
01:10:01,193 --> 01:10:04,863
This photo doesn't resemble as our Sir

864
01:10:05,947 --> 01:10:09,701
After death
face becomes bleak

865
01:10:09,784 --> 01:10:10,827
He is correct

866
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:14,080
Even if you die tomorrow,
you won't look the same

867
01:10:14,164 --> 01:10:17,375
Can you both come inside?

868
01:10:18,877 --> 01:10:20,128
Go inside

869
01:10:20,212 --> 01:10:21,838
Sir, please leave us

870
01:10:21,963 --> 01:10:25,342
I didn't take that photo,
only he does

871
01:10:25,425 --> 01:10:26,885
Keep quiet

872
01:10:30,096 --> 01:10:32,057
Were you scared?

873
01:10:33,225 --> 01:10:35,310
Eat well guys

874
01:10:50,075 --> 01:10:52,285
Can you ask
someone to bring water?

875
01:11:01,044 --> 01:11:05,465
Before you leave, please do
take a photo of Mr Moustache

876
01:11:05,548 --> 01:11:07,342
Don't forget it

877
01:11:10,387 --> 01:11:15,767
Guys, one who got
water for you is my wife

878
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:18,186
Do photograph her silently

879
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:21,523
Don't be shy
Eat well

880
01:11:35,412 --> 01:11:41,626
- Have we seen him somewhere?
- You should have seen him around here

881
01:11:45,297 --> 01:11:48,466
Oh God, uncle...?

882
01:11:49,968 --> 01:11:56,725
Just because I had interest in cinema,
You kept me away from the village

883
01:11:56,808 --> 01:12:01,771
For that won't you inform me
about his death, you sinister?

884
01:12:06,109 --> 01:12:09,404
You were like
a Lion in the forest

885
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:13,033
Now you look
like a chicken in the photo

886
01:12:13,158 --> 01:12:19,956
You closed your eyes without seeing
my role in Bharathiraja's film

887
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:23,376
I exactly resembles his face

888
01:12:27,464 --> 01:12:29,883
Why are you here, guys?

889
01:12:43,396 --> 01:12:46,608
'You have given
light in my life Gopi'

890
01:12:47,567 --> 01:12:49,444
Catch them now

891
01:12:49,527 --> 01:12:51,696
They took my photo
and made me a dead person

892
01:12:53,573 --> 01:12:55,658
Let's run away from here

893
01:12:55,742 --> 01:12:58,870
Start the bike, master

894
01:12:59,829 --> 01:13:01,456
Hell with this bike

895
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:03,249
Don't leave me, master

896
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:06,044
They have cheated me

897
01:13:09,297 --> 01:13:14,010
Master, go fast

898
01:13:19,766 --> 01:13:21,935
Come fast

899
01:13:22,185 --> 01:13:25,105
Catch him
Don't leave

900
01:13:25,188 --> 01:13:26,147
Wait! Wait!

901
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:28,191
They are chasing us
for taking your wife's photo

902
01:13:28,274 --> 01:13:29,943
Is it? Go by this way

903
01:13:30,026 --> 01:13:32,737
They took my photo
and made me a dead person

904
01:13:41,454 --> 01:13:43,415
What happened?

905
01:13:44,165 --> 01:13:45,917
They cheated Munish

906
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,877
They tricked us all and escaped

907
01:13:47,961 --> 01:13:51,631
Got so many of us
but still couldn't catch them

908
01:13:52,549 --> 01:13:54,759
I can run
and catch them

909
01:13:54,843 --> 01:13:56,219
Watch me

910
01:13:56,928 --> 01:13:59,180
Check, are they chasing us?

911
01:13:59,556 --> 01:14:03,476
Idiots, they thought we are
moving fast and stood there

912
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,395
But I know about this bike

913
01:14:29,043 --> 01:14:31,463
Hey, they fell down

914
01:14:32,422 --> 01:14:36,509
Come fast
let's catch them

915
01:14:36,593 --> 01:14:38,636
My dear boy!!

916
01:14:38,761 --> 01:14:40,513
Uncle, still I am not
wash my butt

917
01:14:40,597 --> 01:14:42,515
It doesn't matter
Move away, guys

918
01:14:45,101 --> 01:14:49,564
INTERMISSION

919
01:14:57,614 --> 01:15:00,033
I'm not worried
about their hitting

920
01:15:00,116 --> 01:15:03,119
But can't imagine what
they'll do to us tomorrow

921
01:15:07,665 --> 01:15:12,378
Today Kalaivani was
wearing a red saree, right?

922
01:15:29,229 --> 01:15:30,688
Silent!

923
01:15:32,106 --> 01:15:36,152
Please run away from here
The Villagers are furious

924
01:15:36,236 --> 01:15:38,321
They will do anything tomorrow

925
01:15:38,613 --> 01:15:41,824
Leave before anyone sees

926
01:15:41,908 --> 01:15:43,993
Here, your bike keys

927
01:15:46,454 --> 01:15:49,290
Didn't I say it was
red color saree?

928
01:15:49,374 --> 01:15:51,376
Master, let's leave

929
01:15:51,459 --> 01:15:54,254
We have no other option to escape

930
01:15:54,337 --> 01:15:58,299
Where are you going?
The bike is on the other side

931
01:15:59,551 --> 01:16:02,136
Whatever it is, we will
deal with it later

932
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,333
Don't shake it

933
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:35,295
Don't push it towards the wall

934
01:16:36,379 --> 01:16:38,256
Push it from the back

935
01:16:40,633 --> 01:16:43,052
Can someone fool us
here in Mundasupatti

936
01:16:43,136 --> 01:16:45,263
Whom do you think
you are dealing with?

937
01:16:45,346 --> 01:16:49,058
We should break both their hands

938
01:16:49,142 --> 01:16:52,353
Not just Munis,
You have deceived everyone

939
01:16:52,437 --> 01:16:56,357
And ridiculed our sir too

940
01:16:56,441 --> 01:16:58,484
These are unpardonable mistakes

941
01:16:59,736 --> 01:17:02,280
Bring the temple bell

942
01:17:10,538 --> 01:17:13,750
When the lord
is there to feed us...

943
01:17:13,833 --> 01:17:17,045
...why suffer by doing wrong?

944
01:17:17,128 --> 01:17:22,675
The lord punishes
the wrong

945
01:17:22,759 --> 01:17:28,264
For those who refuse to listen to the lord,
change the very nature of the being

946
01:17:28,348 --> 01:17:32,310
...for that infidel creature,
give us your orders

947
01:17:32,393 --> 01:17:35,813
Oh lord Spirit of the sky

948
01:17:46,658 --> 01:17:49,118
Save them, God

949
01:17:53,081 --> 01:17:56,793
Spirit of the sky isn't
giving us permission

950
01:17:56,876 --> 01:18:00,296
Saying something,
don't let them free

951
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,715
Let's wait for sometime

952
01:18:02,799 --> 01:18:07,887
I think the Spirit of the sky,
doesn't like us punishing them

953
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:10,973
So let the Panchayat decide on this

954
01:18:11,265 --> 01:18:13,768
I think today is your lucky day

955
01:18:13,851 --> 01:18:17,980
We have always got an approval for our
punishment, this is the first time

956
01:18:18,064 --> 01:18:21,859
Let's take this as the order oi
the Spirit of the sky and forgive them

957
01:18:21,943 --> 01:18:27,490
- Let them clean the cow sheds
- Yeah, or else people will go fearless

958
01:18:27,573 --> 01:18:31,994
Let them dig a well
as a punishment

959
01:18:32,078 --> 01:18:35,081
Only after that you'll get back
your bike and the camera

960
01:18:35,164 --> 01:18:38,835
Munis! You've to
supervise their work

961
01:18:40,712 --> 01:18:44,006
If you give us permission, we'll
pack our dress for our stay here

962
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:49,345
With that ii you bring some money you
could go on a trip around the village

963
01:18:49,595 --> 01:18:53,599
I don't care if I am naked
You can use my dresses

964
01:18:53,683 --> 01:18:54,934
Come

965
01:18:57,603 --> 01:19:00,273
Do you remember what was
said in the Panchayat, right?

966
01:19:00,356 --> 01:19:04,485
Kalaivani, give
the shovel to them

967
01:19:07,238 --> 01:19:10,366
From today you are my slaves

968
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:14,036
What's with the stare?
You can't do anything

969
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,501
Wait here I'll take care

970
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:26,883
After me advising,
Why do you keep coming back?

971
01:19:28,593 --> 01:19:30,720
Please leave

972
01:19:30,762 --> 01:19:33,389
If I thought so, I
would have left then

973
01:19:33,473 --> 01:19:35,725
The villagers didn't catch me

974
01:19:35,767 --> 01:19:37,310
I fell on purpose

975
01:19:38,144 --> 01:19:42,190
When I leave from here,
I'll have you by my side

976
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:50,198
- Have you given it?
- Given it, dad

977
01:20:06,589 --> 01:20:07,757
This is where you got to dig

978
01:20:07,799 --> 01:20:09,759
It should be finished
by the end of the month

979
01:20:09,801 --> 01:20:13,679
"I am the smart one in eternal search"

980
01:20:14,722 --> 01:20:19,268
"I am the side-kick that faces the brunt"

981
01:20:20,394 --> 01:20:25,274
"I stood in front for all the blow
that the world gave me"

982
01:20:25,817 --> 01:20:30,696
"I wonder where this will end"

983
01:20:31,155 --> 01:20:33,825
"Oh the Lord of the world"

984
01:20:33,908 --> 01:20:36,327
"Show us the light
at the end of the tunnel"

985
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:40,665
"Show us your surprises
Give us without hurdles"

986
01:20:40,748 --> 01:20:42,250
The pose is not good

987
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:46,671
"Like the 300 spartans
He is ready for the kill"

988
01:20:46,754 --> 01:20:47,463
Now, it's okay

989
01:20:47,547 --> 01:20:52,051
"He'll fall
He'll rise"

990
01:20:59,433 --> 01:21:01,561
God bless you, my dear

991
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:28,212
"it's not an easy world"

992
01:21:28,296 --> 01:21:29,964
We got water already

993
01:21:30,047 --> 01:21:33,718
"You cannot scale heights
without learning"

994
01:21:35,386 --> 01:21:40,057
- Get lost
- If you come, will bury you

995
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:45,730
"The love his making him blind"

996
01:21:45,813 --> 01:21:48,441
"He went crazy
He became fragile"

997
01:21:48,608 --> 01:21:51,152
"The responsibility is mounting"

998
01:21:51,235 --> 01:21:53,529
"There is no time to relax"

999
01:21:53,613 --> 01:22:00,369
"To be aware, to be happy,
I became the puppet,"

1000
01:22:00,453 --> 01:22:03,372
They have witch-crafted
the Post box

1001
01:22:21,891 --> 01:22:25,269
He dug it for 5 years
water didn't come but he died

1002
01:22:25,353 --> 01:22:26,896
He buried him in the same place

1003
01:22:26,938 --> 01:22:30,608
You don't worry
Go and check your moustache

1004
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:51,295
Won't Kalaivani, ever come down to me?

1005
01:22:51,379 --> 01:22:54,298
Is she on a roof top to come down?

1006
01:22:54,382 --> 01:22:58,886
It's not that, you got to do something
so that she has a compassion for you

1007
01:22:58,970 --> 01:23:02,056
We living here itself is pitiful

1008
01:23:02,139 --> 01:23:04,058
That's right

1009
01:23:04,684 --> 01:23:06,602
Nice song!

1010
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:12,149
Only after wearing my dress
you look like humans

1011
01:23:12,525 --> 01:23:13,359
He has started

1012
01:23:13,442 --> 01:23:16,529
You don't need to go dig well today,
Come clean the cow shed

1013
01:23:16,612 --> 01:23:19,240
If we dig a little we might finish

1014
01:23:19,323 --> 01:23:23,077
Just finished to the size of a pit
and you say you are finished

1015
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,831
Come and pick the cow's dung

1016
01:23:29,709 --> 01:23:32,211
Look, how I make her
feel compassionate to me

1017
01:23:34,505 --> 01:23:38,259
- Did you call me?
- Yes, you fool

1018
01:23:38,759 --> 01:23:40,428
Here I come

1019
01:23:42,555 --> 01:23:46,475
What do you think of yourself?
You slaves

1020
01:23:46,559 --> 01:23:49,937
I will...
Did you hurt?

1021
01:23:50,354 --> 01:23:53,149
Advise him or you'll
get beaten too

1022
01:23:53,858 --> 01:23:56,193
She isn't looking
Hit him

1023
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:01,198
How dare you beat me?

1024
01:24:01,282 --> 01:24:04,118
Save my master!
Save him

1025
01:24:04,535 --> 01:24:06,203
ls there no one here?

1026
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:08,706
They are hitting my master,
Save him!

1027
01:24:08,789 --> 01:24:10,708
I will rip your back off

1028
01:24:12,585 --> 01:24:14,503
She isn't looking

1029
01:24:18,215 --> 01:24:20,551
lam gonna bury you both
in the pit you dug

1030
01:24:20,634 --> 01:24:22,845
Hitting me, wearing my cloths

1031
01:24:22,928 --> 01:24:26,098
He is hitting again,
Please save my master!

1032
01:24:26,182 --> 01:24:28,642
Stop hitting

1033
01:24:28,726 --> 01:24:32,438
Kalaivani, how long will it take
to finish the Rangoli?

1034
01:24:35,733 --> 01:24:37,151
I'm coming, mom

1035
01:24:37,568 --> 01:24:41,697
Trying to blow off my light

1036
01:24:42,073 --> 01:24:44,784
ls there no one to
question this injustice?

1037
01:24:44,867 --> 01:24:48,412
- Uncle! Don't hit
- He's still hitting my master

1038
01:24:48,496 --> 01:24:51,082
Leave them uncle,
Why are you hitting them?

1039
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:53,751
You don't know about him

1040
01:24:53,834 --> 01:24:56,879
He did it all
and now has an innocent look

1041
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,548
Leave him

1042
01:24:59,632 --> 01:25:02,093
Mom called you for Tea

1043
01:25:02,176 --> 01:25:05,387
Tea? With cow's milk?

1044
01:25:05,471 --> 01:25:09,266
After tea I am gonna kill you both

1045
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:11,102
Go man

1046
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:17,775
Why do you have to get these beatings?
Please go away

1047
01:25:20,528 --> 01:25:22,947
Whatever problem we face

1048
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:26,659
Even if we die,
I will never leave from here

1049
01:25:27,827 --> 01:25:29,495
Why should I die?

1050
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,334
Won't your parents search for you?

1051
01:25:37,378 --> 01:25:39,046
I have no one for me

1052
01:25:42,133 --> 01:25:43,968
I only have you in my life

1053
01:25:58,691 --> 01:26:04,321
Sister! Who is that in the photo?

1054
01:26:07,533 --> 01:26:11,036
That's Munis uncle,
But for us it's Sire

1055
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,663
How is that?

1056
01:26:12,746 --> 01:26:13,831
That's it

1057
01:26:15,166 --> 01:26:16,500
Here it's your turn

1058
01:26:22,798 --> 01:26:24,675
I've won!

1059
01:26:24,758 --> 01:26:26,177
You have lost the game

1060
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:53,954
"The seeds of love sown one day"

1061
01:26:54,038 --> 01:26:57,583
"I see the leaves of growth today"

1062
01:26:57,666 --> 01:27:05,507
"She grows within my heart
and stays forever"

1063
01:27:35,412 --> 01:27:38,290
Are they celebrating for
catching those slave?

1064
01:27:38,374 --> 01:27:40,125
What is this?

1065
01:27:40,209 --> 01:27:42,962
- Munis uncle?
- What's it sweety?

1066
01:27:43,045 --> 01:27:45,923
They said that's you in the photo

1067
01:27:46,006 --> 01:27:49,009
- Yes
- Will you die?

1068
01:27:51,136 --> 01:27:52,471
Is it your work?

1069
01:27:52,554 --> 01:27:55,599
It's my mistake, Give me that
hand, now keep it in your mouth

1070
01:27:55,683 --> 01:27:58,394
All aims to kill me

1071
01:27:58,727 --> 01:28:00,771
Do you want a pair at this age?

1072
01:28:02,356 --> 01:28:03,399
Malar stop!

1073
01:28:03,482 --> 01:28:05,359
Don't come here again

1074
01:28:05,442 --> 01:28:07,903
Ganesa, waiting for
the food to be served?

1075
01:28:07,987 --> 01:28:13,158
I didn't get a rose garland
could only get a Marigold one

1076
01:28:18,122 --> 01:28:21,125
Why are you praying with my photo?

1077
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:23,794
Munis this isn't you
It's our Sir

1078
01:28:23,877 --> 01:28:24,837
What sir?

1079
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,298
This is the only
photo resembling him

1080
01:28:27,381 --> 01:28:28,215
So?

1081
01:28:28,299 --> 01:28:30,801
Today's is the 16th day prayer,
We needed a photo

1082
01:28:30,884 --> 01:28:32,469
Why, you could have prayed with me there

1083
01:28:32,553 --> 01:28:34,263
The village people
should accept this

1084
01:28:35,848 --> 01:28:38,100
They only took a photo of me

1085
01:28:39,935 --> 01:28:43,480
But you guys are doing
the funeral rites for my photo

1086
01:28:43,564 --> 01:28:47,109
It's just for today, From tomorrow
we will only light the lamps

1087
01:28:47,192 --> 01:28:52,114
How many will light a lamp for me?
Get off my sight

1088
01:28:52,197 --> 01:28:54,908
0k finish your prayers,
You are always playful

1089
01:28:54,992 --> 01:28:56,118
Playful?

1090
01:28:56,702 --> 01:28:59,288
Why do I have to play with you?

1091
01:29:00,748 --> 01:29:03,917
You all should've decorated my Cut-outs
but I've ended up with this

1092
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:08,547
I too have feeling

1093
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:13,844
- What's that in black?
- That's tried meat

1094
01:29:16,055 --> 01:29:18,098
They'll never believe me

1095
01:29:18,182 --> 01:29:21,310
This is our Sir!
This is our Sir!

1096
01:29:21,352 --> 01:29:22,936
I'll take some fried meat

1097
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:25,856
That's for our Sir

1098
01:29:25,939 --> 01:29:29,777
That's me in the Photo, but
the fried meat is for Sir

1099
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:33,030
Where is the lunch happening?
At least tell that

1100
01:29:37,326 --> 01:29:40,245
Slaves, have a candy

1101
01:29:41,205 --> 01:29:43,248
Take it
You take one

1102
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,502
Is it your birthday?

1103
01:29:47,836 --> 01:29:49,588
The day a star is born

1104
01:29:50,672 --> 01:29:53,384
- I don't get it
- That's why you are in the pit

1105
01:29:53,467 --> 01:29:55,844
Today, my debut film is releasing

1106
01:29:55,928 --> 01:29:59,390
That film is releasing?
What's the name of that film?

1107
01:29:59,723 --> 01:30:04,395
The Movies name is
"Breaking Dawn"

1108
01:30:05,604 --> 01:30:07,731
"Breaking Dawn"?

1109
01:30:07,815 --> 01:30:09,525
Who is the director?

1110
01:30:09,608 --> 01:30:12,111
Director Steven Spiel Kumar

1111
01:30:12,903 --> 01:30:14,655
Steven Spiel Kumar?

1112
01:30:14,822 --> 01:30:20,035
He is both the hero, the heroine
and as well directed the movie

1113
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:23,372
I just come for a scene,
But a powerful performance

1114
01:30:23,455 --> 01:30:25,541
What's that scene?

1115
01:30:25,624 --> 01:30:27,292
Here, I go

1116
01:30:28,001 --> 01:30:32,256
In a Panchayat, one fellow
pinches the hip of the heroine

1117
01:30:32,339 --> 01:30:34,925
You mean the hip of Steven Spiel Kumar

1118
01:30:35,008 --> 01:30:36,510
You are right

1119
01:30:36,635 --> 01:30:40,597
After pinching,
the fellow escapes from there

1120
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:43,434
And you are the one
who catches that culprit

1121
01:30:43,517 --> 01:30:44,893
That's where you are wrong

1122
01:30:44,977 --> 01:30:47,271
I'm the one who pinches the hip

1123
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,607
Feeling jealous?

1124
01:30:50,691 --> 01:30:55,571
Never dream that I will
take you both for this film

1125
01:30:55,654 --> 01:30:57,614
Because you both are my slaves

1126
01:30:57,698 --> 01:31:00,576
Going to your film
itself is a punishment

1127
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:03,328
I will meet you
after the film

1128
01:31:03,954 --> 01:31:06,248
Till then look at this piece of art

1129
01:31:15,132 --> 01:31:17,885
List is too long!

1130
01:31:17,968 --> 01:31:21,472
Which is the hip here?
Where would he have pinched?

1131
01:31:21,555 --> 01:31:23,891
He would have pinched some place
Get to work!

1132
01:31:24,475 --> 01:31:26,685
Don't miss the first ten minutes

1133
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:32,608
I would be a Cameraman by now, if
I had gone with Balu Mahendra then

1134
01:31:32,691 --> 01:31:34,193
Greetings sir!

1135
01:31:34,276 --> 01:31:38,780
- Sir tell has some regards for us
- Those guys are waiting for dinner

1136
01:31:38,864 --> 01:31:40,491
He made us beggars

1137
01:31:41,492 --> 01:31:46,413
- When we fall in love...
- Also don't forget the Dog

1138
01:31:48,165 --> 01:31:49,917
Hey! Muniskanth

1139
01:31:51,126 --> 01:31:53,295
- Dinner?
- Yes

1140
01:31:53,378 --> 01:31:55,130
Come join us

1141
01:31:55,255 --> 01:31:58,550
Am I, slaves like you

1142
01:31:58,634 --> 01:32:00,677
I'll have my dinner inside

1143
01:32:00,761 --> 01:32:01,595
I'll kill you

1144
01:32:03,013 --> 01:32:05,224
Did you watch my movie, brother?

1145
01:32:05,807 --> 01:32:11,605
How dare you didn't follow the village
rules and now showing me this paper

1146
01:32:11,688 --> 01:32:13,649
No dinner for you
get out of here

1147
01:32:16,693 --> 01:32:20,906
If you bring that paper here
I will burn your head down

1148
01:32:21,281 --> 01:32:23,617
Is it a paper?
It's an art

1149
01:32:25,702 --> 01:32:29,623
You have missed dinner for a Star

1150
01:32:29,706 --> 01:32:31,833
You could've come and joined us

1151
01:32:31,917 --> 01:32:34,086
How many times will you see it?

1152
01:32:34,836 --> 01:32:36,547
Eat well
I am leaving

1153
01:32:36,797 --> 01:32:39,341
- Going out to beg?
- Yeah, want to join

1154
01:32:54,773 --> 01:32:56,316
Show your plate

1155
01:33:11,164 --> 01:33:13,000
She is looking

1156
01:33:18,213 --> 01:33:20,799
Believe me
She did see

1157
01:33:26,847 --> 01:33:29,433
We could have just earned
with our photography

1158
01:33:29,516 --> 01:33:32,936
You falling in love
has got us into this pit

1159
01:33:37,316 --> 01:33:39,234
Kalaivani is thinking of me

1160
01:33:39,318 --> 01:33:43,363
Only you are saying so,
But she shows no sign

1161
01:33:43,447 --> 01:33:46,283
We are here digging pits

1162
01:33:46,366 --> 01:33:52,039
She is going to marry that Shanmugam and
we are going to be guest at her marriage

1163
01:33:57,169 --> 01:34:02,090
What I said might me wrong, For that
should you bring me to this roof top

1164
01:34:03,508 --> 01:34:06,970
Have we dressed up at night to
be an audience to see her sleep

1165
01:34:07,387 --> 01:34:11,308
She looks like a calf

1166
01:34:11,391 --> 01:34:13,560
But snores like a bear

1167
01:34:13,644 --> 01:34:14,936
See carefully

1168
01:34:17,105 --> 01:34:21,193
He's snoring like a rhinoceros

1169
01:34:21,276 --> 01:34:25,614
In this sound she will never
wake even if a thunder strikes

1170
01:34:25,697 --> 01:34:27,491
And how will she think of you

1171
01:34:27,699 --> 01:34:32,496
I know from my heart that
she is thinking of me

1172
01:34:32,663 --> 01:34:36,041
Few slaps will bring
you out of this dream

1173
01:34:36,124 --> 01:34:37,793
Wait a minute

1174
01:34:43,799 --> 01:34:46,843
At midnight only you will get such Ideas

1175
01:34:58,689 --> 01:35:00,607
Oh God! Master

1176
01:35:22,879 --> 01:35:26,925
- This girl is in love with Rajinikanth
- It's me!!

1177
01:35:28,844 --> 01:35:31,179
The end of the Photo Studio

1178
01:35:31,263 --> 01:35:33,890
Look, there is someone
on that roof top

1179
01:35:33,974 --> 01:35:36,685
- That's Mr Moustache's house
- Let that go

1180
01:35:36,768 --> 01:35:38,729
He too should have got an hiccup

1181
01:35:38,812 --> 01:35:42,023
He looks like a robber
Come, let's go and see

1182
01:36:38,538 --> 01:36:40,499
What were you doing in
Mr Moustache's house?

1183
01:36:40,582 --> 01:36:42,083
Aren't you a thief?

1184
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:44,044
Alagu, go call the villagers

1185
01:36:44,127 --> 01:36:46,797
Let's deal it ourselves, master

1186
01:36:52,803 --> 01:36:54,805
You're dumb

1187
01:36:59,267 --> 01:37:01,228
Get up

1188
01:37:02,103 --> 01:37:04,564
He looks pitiful

1189
01:37:04,648 --> 01:37:07,359
If he gets into the hands of the villagers
they will break his bones

1190
01:37:08,693 --> 01:37:11,071
I should never see you

1191
01:37:11,154 --> 01:37:12,906
Go

1192
01:37:14,199 --> 01:37:15,617
You thief!

1193
01:37:18,537 --> 01:37:20,080
Have a long-life

1194
01:37:24,835 --> 01:37:26,795
Have a long-life

1195
01:37:36,304 --> 01:37:38,348
I will...beat him

1196
01:37:40,308 --> 01:37:44,354
Don't hurt my mouth
I'll never lie again

1197
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:46,439
How did you become a Guruji?

1198
01:37:48,149 --> 01:37:50,193
Nothing big

1199
01:37:50,277 --> 01:37:53,238
15 years ago
when I escaped from prison

1200
01:37:53,321 --> 01:37:56,074
I took a cloth from
the beggar by the street

1201
01:37:56,157 --> 01:37:58,368
You even robbed a beggar

1202
01:37:58,451 --> 01:38:00,453
Okay, continue

1203
01:38:00,537 --> 01:38:03,498
I fell asleep on
the hill near the village

1204
01:38:03,582 --> 01:38:07,669
The next morning,
The whole village was around me

1205
01:38:12,382 --> 01:38:17,637
Everyone was requesting me
to exorcist this village

1206
01:38:17,721 --> 01:38:19,931
I was being chased then

1207
01:38:20,015 --> 01:38:22,851
I was surprised
why they were asking me so

1208
01:38:22,893 --> 01:38:25,604
Then I noticed the cloth
I robbed was a Guru's dress

1209
01:38:25,937 --> 01:38:32,068
Then I decided this was
the right place to settle down

1210
01:38:34,362 --> 01:38:35,405
That's it

1211
01:38:35,488 --> 01:38:39,034
What's with you
and Mrs. Moustache

1212
01:38:39,117 --> 01:38:42,871
It's nothing wrong
We've a rightful friendship between us

1213
01:38:42,913 --> 01:38:45,206
We know about your friendship

1214
01:38:45,457 --> 01:38:49,920
Mrs. Moustache's pointed to Palanisamy
that day, then how did you come in?

1215
01:38:50,003 --> 01:38:52,422
Nothing like that
She is not of that kind

1216
01:38:53,548 --> 01:38:55,759
Palanisamy! Stop there!

1217
01:38:55,842 --> 01:38:57,302
What work do you have at my house?

1218
01:38:57,385 --> 01:38:58,386
He is chasing someone

1219
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:00,931
Won't you ever listen to what I say?

1220
01:39:01,723 --> 01:39:06,394
Palanisamy, you'll be
caught red-handed

1221
01:39:08,396 --> 01:39:09,564
Move aside

1222
01:39:09,648 --> 01:39:13,568
Ganesa, Rathinasamy
When did you all come in?

1223
01:39:13,652 --> 01:39:17,113
- Only this evening
- Stop! Stop!

1224
01:39:17,197 --> 01:39:19,282
Tea shop guy too

1225
01:39:24,913 --> 01:39:27,916
She has cheated me too

1226
01:39:32,879 --> 01:39:34,506
Watch now

1227
01:39:39,427 --> 01:39:42,263
The village is at my feet
But these fellows

1228
01:39:42,347 --> 01:39:44,057
Long live, my dear

1229
01:39:48,436 --> 01:39:50,146
Give me the papad

1230
01:39:56,569 --> 01:39:57,904
- Take it
- Eat it

1231
01:39:59,614 --> 01:40:00,240
Greetings, sir!

1232
01:40:00,323 --> 01:40:04,285
Mr Moustache seemed like you had
many guests yesterday night

1233
01:40:04,369 --> 01:40:08,331
Are you not ashamed to eat
what was served for the guru?

1234
01:40:08,415 --> 01:40:13,545
They asked out of desire
I gave it myself to them

1235
01:40:13,628 --> 01:40:18,174
Learn to live disciplined
life from Guruji

1236
01:40:18,758 --> 01:40:21,011
Will Guru have time to teach us?

1237
01:40:21,094 --> 01:40:26,641
Why not? He is the reason
my wife is a disciplined woman

1238
01:40:26,725 --> 01:40:28,226
Mr Moustache is talking
as none listens to him

1239
01:40:28,309 --> 01:40:32,564
I ask forgiveness for them
Please forgive them

1240
01:40:32,647 --> 01:40:35,942
- Why should you ask for their forgiveness?
- I have no other option

1241
01:40:36,026 --> 01:40:39,029
Be generous like Guruji

1242
01:40:51,082 --> 01:40:53,418
Have a long-life

1243
01:40:56,337 --> 01:41:01,426
I've seen this guy somewhere
But can't remember rightly

1244
01:41:03,428 --> 01:41:06,806
Alagu, what would you
do when you sleep?

1245
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:07,974
I'll sleep

1246
01:41:08,391 --> 01:41:11,686
- What about you Guruji?
- Does he have time for that?

1247
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:13,480
He goes around
the village at night

1248
01:41:13,563 --> 01:41:18,818
But few draw their loved
ones and sleep cuddling it

1249
01:41:34,334 --> 01:41:38,254
"Like the sweetness of water
that springs through the well"

1250
01:41:38,338 --> 01:41:41,633
"The ecstatic feel of love
for you passes through me"

1251
01:41:41,716 --> 01:41:49,099
"Every sip of it takes my breath away"

1252
01:41:52,352 --> 01:41:54,646
Did you hear the news?

1253
01:41:54,729 --> 01:41:56,356
Guruji has left the village

1254
01:41:56,439 --> 01:41:57,398
What do you mean?

1255
01:41:57,482 --> 01:42:00,944
He has gone on
a pilgrim to the Himalayas

1256
01:42:01,027 --> 01:42:04,489
Himalayas?
He should be at some roof top

1257
01:42:04,572 --> 01:42:07,700
Mr Moustache, what's
with all these loads?

1258
01:42:07,784 --> 01:42:13,581
I am expanding my petty shop
So went out for a purchase

1259
01:42:15,083 --> 01:42:18,336
There is no one to buy
but he keeps expanding

1260
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:22,924
Where is my Petty shop?

1261
01:42:23,341 --> 01:42:25,718
Hey. Karpagam...

1262
01:42:25,802 --> 01:42:28,596
Where is my wife?

1263
01:42:29,973 --> 01:42:32,433
My wife is missing!

1264
01:42:32,517 --> 01:42:35,145
Chief...

1265
01:42:37,313 --> 01:42:40,275
Mr Moustache, what happened?
Stop crying and tell

1266
01:42:40,358 --> 01:42:43,027
My wife is missing!

1267
01:42:46,156 --> 01:42:49,159
It's not just my wife

1268
01:42:49,242 --> 01:42:52,996
My petty shop too is missing

1269
01:42:54,164 --> 01:42:56,749
So Guruji has hit
the Jackpot in one toss

1270
01:42:56,833 --> 01:42:59,711
Let's go in and talk about it

1271
01:43:01,045 --> 01:43:02,005
Secret...?

1272
01:43:02,088 --> 01:43:04,048
Give the shovel to those boys

1273
01:43:04,132 --> 01:43:09,429
Even after that night he has eloped
with her, means he is such a loser

1274
01:43:19,397 --> 01:43:22,650
I know you love me
Why don't you express it?

1275
01:43:27,739 --> 01:43:30,450
I've got to go
Dad is waiting outside

1276
01:43:30,533 --> 01:43:31,659
Please tell me and go

1277
01:43:32,202 --> 01:43:33,661
Dad!

1278
01:43:56,976 --> 01:43:59,020
Have you given it?

1279
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,357
Gave it, dad

1280
01:44:04,692 --> 01:44:08,238
Sudamani, where are you?
I can't run anymore

1281
01:44:08,321 --> 01:44:10,823
Give my dress back

1282
01:44:11,366 --> 01:44:14,035
If I catch you...

1283
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,419
Give back my dress

1284
01:44:23,503 --> 01:44:26,381
Or I'll not teach you dance

1285
01:44:26,464 --> 01:44:28,091
Where are you?

1286
01:44:28,383 --> 01:44:29,926
You are here

1287
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:32,553
Now, I'll catch you

1288
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:35,348
Uncle, I fooled you

1289
01:44:54,492 --> 01:44:59,664
"Never distant your dream of love"

1290
01:44:59,747 --> 01:45:05,169
'Never hide and run away
from your desires"

1291
01:45:15,888 --> 01:45:20,518
'Never distant your dream of love"

1292
01:45:20,601 --> 01:45:25,815
"Never hide and run away
from your desires"

1293
01:45:26,441 --> 01:45:31,237
"I am longing to meet you"

1294
01:45:31,654 --> 01:45:36,326
"I am eyeing the way you arrive"

1295
01:45:36,409 --> 01:45:41,122
"My heart feels like
the nectar of the honey kingdom"

1296
01:45:41,205 --> 01:45:47,462
"And the pleasant smell of a meadow"

1297
01:45:47,962 --> 01:45:53,051
"Never distant your dream of love"

1298
01:45:53,217 --> 01:45:54,969
Give way

1299
01:45:55,053 --> 01:45:56,971
What are you doing?

1300
01:45:57,347 --> 01:45:59,557
Click the photo quickly

1301
01:46:13,696 --> 01:46:15,990
No, listen to me

1302
01:46:16,574 --> 01:46:19,702
Wait, I'll finish the job for sake of you

1303
01:46:22,246 --> 01:46:24,832
"Your words are unspoken"

1304
01:46:24,916 --> 01:46:27,668
You didn't tell
there was a lamb inside

1305
01:46:27,877 --> 01:46:31,464
"it made a lovable reading"

1306
01:46:32,215 --> 01:46:37,887
"Like the thread woven of silk
That slithers off from the cloth"

1307
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:42,600
"My heart melts for you"

1308
01:46:43,309 --> 01:46:48,689
"I've become the catamaran that
brushes over the night sea"

1309
01:46:48,815 --> 01:46:53,986
"I've become your Stallone for the race"

1310
01:46:54,070 --> 01:47:00,159
"Let this heart not change
Let this feeling not dwindle"

1311
01:47:21,722 --> 01:47:25,101
The dog died watching your dance

1312
01:47:28,813 --> 01:47:34,110
"Stayed humble in your teenage
Crossing no limits any moment"

1313
01:47:34,193 --> 01:47:36,988
"I got a new energy to go forward"

1314
01:47:37,071 --> 01:47:39,323
This job is only left for me to do

1315
01:47:39,407 --> 01:47:44,620
"I've begun to be your shadow
I've begun to read my dreams"

1316
01:47:44,704 --> 01:47:48,833
"I've begun to love you till death"

1317
01:47:50,668 --> 01:47:53,171
"Never distant your dream of love"

1318
01:47:56,048 --> 01:47:58,926
"Never hide and run away
from your desires"

1319
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:06,350
"Never distant your dream of love"

1320
01:48:06,434 --> 01:48:11,814
"Never hide and run away
from your desires"

1321
01:48:11,898 --> 01:48:17,195
"I am longing to meet you"

1322
01:48:17,278 --> 01:48:21,782
"I am eyeing the way you arrive"

1323
01:48:21,908 --> 01:48:26,204
"My heart feels like
the nectar of the honey kingdom"

1324
01:48:26,996 --> 01:48:32,543
"And the pleasant smell of a meadow"

1325
01:48:36,088 --> 01:48:40,510
Let's have the marriage on Friday
That's our decision

1326
01:48:40,593 --> 01:48:45,431
What you say is right,
But it's sounds too early

1327
01:48:45,515 --> 01:48:49,852
The marriage has been postponed
once already, that's why

1328
01:48:49,936 --> 01:48:53,689
Why should we delay it?
Let's finish it early

1329
01:48:53,773 --> 01:48:55,316
Give it a thought and say

1330
01:48:57,193 --> 01:48:58,361
Take this

1331
01:48:58,611 --> 01:49:00,488
Call this marriage off

1332
01:49:00,571 --> 01:49:03,908
- What do you mean?
- I don't like this groom

1333
01:49:03,991 --> 01:49:08,412
I thought you were saying it in anger
that day, will you keep repeating it now

1334
01:49:08,496 --> 01:49:11,457
If your father knows this
he'll kill you

1335
01:49:11,541 --> 01:49:13,167
Go serve them coffee

1336
01:49:13,251 --> 01:49:15,962
Everyone are here
And you make a scene now

1337
01:49:16,045 --> 01:49:19,006
- Go serve it
- I won't go

1338
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:21,300
Kalaivani, where is the coffee?

1339
01:49:22,385 --> 01:49:24,637
Go, give it

1340
01:49:25,429 --> 01:49:27,348
I'll go and tell
I don't like the groom

1341
01:49:27,723 --> 01:49:29,767
What happened?

1342
01:49:31,852 --> 01:49:33,396
I don't like the groom

1343
01:49:34,146 --> 01:49:35,982
I am not interested
in this marriage

1344
01:49:38,818 --> 01:49:43,573
Is this a game, at the day of
engagement saying you are not interested?

1345
01:49:44,782 --> 01:49:47,493
Shouldn't have pampered you

1346
01:49:47,577 --> 01:49:49,996
Don't spoil the pride of our family

1347
01:49:50,079 --> 01:49:54,625
If you plan anything, I'll
kill both you and your mother

1348
01:49:54,709 --> 01:49:56,544
Bring us coffee

1349
01:50:04,635 --> 01:50:05,678
Sister...!

1350
01:50:14,103 --> 01:50:18,107
Let's have the marriage on Friday
Make all the arrangements

1351
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:19,942
Very happy

1352
01:50:27,241 --> 01:50:33,497
Let's go back, if the villagers know
why we are here they will break our bones

1353
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,370
All these days work have gone in vain

1354
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:17,541
Give it to the groom

1355
01:51:18,459 --> 01:51:20,711
Marriage is tomorrow,
You got any plans?

1356
01:51:22,963 --> 01:51:25,591
Tie 3 knots on that branch

1357
01:51:26,676 --> 01:51:28,678
Let's leave

1358
01:51:29,261 --> 01:51:31,639
Let's leave it to the spirit of the sky

1359
01:51:31,681 --> 01:51:33,641
Cut it in one go

1360
01:51:36,227 --> 01:51:38,062
Why shouldn't we take
Spirit of the sky away?

1361
01:51:40,439 --> 01:51:43,901
They will stop the marriage
if the Idol goes missing

1362
01:51:43,984 --> 01:51:47,446
They Will kill us

1363
01:51:48,698 --> 01:51:50,491
Do you mean it?

1364
01:51:50,574 --> 01:51:55,538
I've decided, I love her
I should do something for her

1365
01:51:58,499 --> 01:52:01,043
How will we open that lock?

1366
01:52:01,127 --> 01:52:02,962
Breaking it is impossible

1367
01:52:03,045 --> 01:52:05,172
You don't have to break it

1368
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,884
I'll get the keys for you

1369
01:52:08,968 --> 01:52:11,762
Will you take good care of my sister?

1370
01:53:07,485 --> 01:53:10,321
Let's break the temple's lock

1371
01:53:10,529 --> 01:53:12,656
Hey Sudamani!

1372
01:53:16,786 --> 01:53:17,745
Come here

1373
01:53:20,331 --> 01:53:21,624
Why are you not sleeping?

1374
01:53:21,707 --> 01:53:23,751
Going for a wee

1375
01:53:23,834 --> 01:53:29,131
Don't know what got into you
Always going out for bathroom

1376
01:53:29,215 --> 01:53:30,382
O Kay

1377
01:53:31,926 --> 01:53:34,094
This is disturbing my sleep

1378
01:53:34,178 --> 01:53:35,721
Go keep this in the shelve

1379
01:54:03,707 --> 01:54:07,086
Get up! We have lot of work today

1380
01:54:08,587 --> 01:54:11,006
What brings you
here at this time?

1381
01:54:12,299 --> 01:54:16,387
Why did you rob Spirit of the Sky?
No one saw you, right?

1382
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:18,430
Kalaivani, time is up

1383
01:54:18,514 --> 01:54:20,349
Wear silk saree and come

1384
01:54:20,432 --> 01:54:23,477
Watch your step

1385
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,856
Bring the bride

1386
01:54:34,905 --> 01:54:37,575
No one will find it

1387
01:54:37,658 --> 01:54:40,452
The vampire is the guard
for the Idol now

1388
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:52,381
Shall I go tell them?

1389
01:55:00,931 --> 01:55:06,061
Never before has such thing happened
Don't know what is going to happen?

1390
01:55:08,939 --> 01:55:12,359
Spirit of the sky is missing

1391
01:55:16,822 --> 01:55:19,450
Oh God, what has happened?

1392
01:55:19,617 --> 01:55:24,872
The Spirit of the sky is missing

1393
01:55:37,801 --> 01:55:41,555
We've all been stranded
without the Spirit

1394
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:44,099
Should this happen at
the time of Kalaivani's marriage

1395
01:55:46,602 --> 01:55:48,604
Uncle, don't worry

1396
01:55:48,687 --> 01:55:49,813
Somehow we will find out

1397
01:55:49,897 --> 01:55:54,234
We have to search to find it?
What's the use just talking about it?

1398
01:55:54,944 --> 01:56:00,032
Shanmugham, take your men
and search in the east

1399
01:56:00,115 --> 01:56:04,286
Return only when you find it or after
you get the info that we have found it

1400
01:56:04,370 --> 01:56:07,831
Mr. Moustache, you go west

1401
01:56:07,915 --> 01:56:12,211
Palanisamy, you go south

1402
01:56:12,294 --> 01:56:14,463
Velliyangiri, you go search the North

1403
01:56:14,546 --> 01:56:18,425
This is not fair sending your
son-in-law to a safe zone

1404
01:56:18,509 --> 01:56:20,928
Sending me to the north,
Knowing it's haunted

1405
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:23,681
If the vampire kills me
who'll care for my family

1406
01:56:23,806 --> 01:56:26,642
- Don't raise your voice
- I didn't say anything wrong

1407
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:30,771
Stop your fight

1408
01:56:30,854 --> 01:56:33,565
Listen to me

1409
01:56:33,649 --> 01:56:36,944
Thought the fight for their
wives only but even for a stone

1410
01:56:37,027 --> 01:56:37,903
Hey. keep quiet

1411
01:56:37,987 --> 01:56:40,864
One night I wasn't here,
There is no security for the Idol

1412
01:56:40,948 --> 01:56:42,825
How much responsibilities shall I have?

1413
01:56:42,908 --> 01:56:47,162
Spirit of the sky is missing!

1414
01:56:47,246 --> 01:56:48,956
Come with me

1415
01:56:48,998 --> 01:56:51,000
Look how he found out

1416
01:56:51,083 --> 01:56:56,797
lam talking something serious
and you all keep staring at me

1417
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:59,842
- Come here
- What's it?

1418
01:56:59,925 --> 01:57:02,261
- Go and sit there
- Is he called for this?

1419
01:57:05,514 --> 01:57:09,810
No other way, I'll go north

1420
01:57:10,477 --> 01:57:13,522
I don't care
if I die serving this Village

1421
01:57:13,605 --> 01:57:16,025
So they already knew about this

1422
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:21,697
You don't have to go
We'll go north

1423
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:24,616
Do you plan to escape from there?

1424
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:28,287
If we thought so we would
have escaped long back

1425
01:57:32,041 --> 01:57:34,001
That would never
happen when I am here

1426
01:57:34,043 --> 01:57:37,087
We went for a cinema day before

1427
01:57:37,171 --> 01:57:40,132
- Breaking dawn, right?
- Never ending Yawn...

1428
01:57:40,215 --> 01:57:41,967
Look at his arrogance

1429
01:57:42,051 --> 01:57:44,219
Let them go

1430
01:57:44,303 --> 01:57:46,805
They tried to fool the village
let them go

1431
01:57:46,889 --> 01:57:48,182
He always give us trouble

1432
01:57:48,265 --> 01:57:50,976
Let's not send them alone
Who's going with them?

1433
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:54,646
Send Ganesan
He has nothing to do other than eat

1434
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:56,398
Let him at least do this

1435
01:57:56,607 --> 01:57:58,984
Why are you looking at me?

1436
01:58:03,447 --> 01:58:06,200
What have I got for
everyone to look at me?

1437
01:58:10,496 --> 01:58:14,083
What...what is your problem?

1438
01:58:14,166 --> 01:58:16,168
This isn't fair

1439
01:58:16,251 --> 01:58:18,087
They've cornered him

1440
01:58:18,504 --> 01:58:21,965
They'll sacrifice me to the vampire

1441
01:58:22,049 --> 01:58:24,218
I've got a film shoot

1442
01:58:24,426 --> 01:58:25,886
I have commitments

1443
01:58:25,969 --> 01:58:28,263
Don't you know what it is?

1444
01:58:28,347 --> 01:58:29,389
Come, let's go

1445
01:58:29,473 --> 01:58:33,060
This village is losing a star

1446
01:58:33,143 --> 01:58:36,355
It's enough if you can
feed me porridge

1447
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:40,609
No one from the village has come here

1448
01:58:40,692 --> 01:58:42,444
No

1449
01:58:42,569 --> 01:58:44,780
Let's check that school first

1450
01:58:44,863 --> 01:58:47,074
School! I won't come

1451
01:58:47,157 --> 01:58:50,828
I have seen it in my small age

1452
01:58:50,911 --> 01:58:54,206
I won't come with you

1453
01:58:54,832 --> 01:58:56,834
Why are you still alive?

1454
01:58:56,917 --> 01:59:01,713
If we take this back to the village,
just see the respect they give us

1455
01:59:04,508 --> 01:59:06,260
Where is the stone!

1456
01:59:06,927 --> 01:59:08,804
We left it here

1457
01:59:09,263 --> 01:59:13,392
- Who would've taken it?
- 0k, let's search

1458
01:59:14,518 --> 01:59:16,478
- Master
- What?

1459
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:20,065
He has taken the stone
and let off the cloth

1460
01:59:23,819 --> 01:59:27,364
Are you haunted,
that's why I said not to go inside

1461
01:59:27,447 --> 01:59:30,284
Spirit of the Sky is lost!

1462
01:59:30,367 --> 01:59:33,954
That is why we are here
Are you playing with me?

1463
01:59:34,037 --> 01:59:36,456
Really, Spirit of
the Sky is lost!

1464
01:59:37,666 --> 01:59:41,753
Did they see the Vampire?
Lets keep it cool with them

1465
01:59:43,547 --> 01:59:48,594
Only if the Idol is found
his health will recover

1466
01:59:49,678 --> 01:59:51,471
There is no information about the idol

1467
01:59:51,555 --> 01:59:53,265
Don't worry, in-law

1468
01:59:53,348 --> 01:59:56,351
Shanmugam will surely find the Idol

1469
01:59:56,435 --> 01:59:59,771
Before Shanmugam
the Photographer will find it

1470
01:59:59,855 --> 02:00:03,233
If I laugh a bit you'll come inside

1471
02:00:03,609 --> 02:00:06,904
Stand out you slaves

1472
02:00:07,487 --> 02:00:10,699
I've searched all over the village

1473
02:00:10,782 --> 02:00:13,911
But I couldn't find the God's statue

1474
02:00:13,994 --> 02:00:17,623
Sudamani, the Idol is missing
at the place we left it

1475
02:00:17,706 --> 02:00:20,542
My father is dying

1476
02:00:21,251 --> 02:00:24,963
We searched around
couldn't find it any place

1477
02:00:25,130 --> 02:00:27,466
I gave you the keys believing you

1478
02:00:27,549 --> 02:00:30,135
Everyone is seeing

1479
02:00:31,678 --> 02:00:33,764
We'll find it

1480
02:00:40,062 --> 02:00:42,898
No one from the village
would've taken it

1481
02:00:43,857 --> 02:00:44,858
Why master?

1482
02:00:45,359 --> 02:00:48,111
They would have never entered the school

1483
02:00:48,987 --> 02:00:51,448
It should be someone from outside

1484
02:00:52,074 --> 02:00:55,827
Apart from us
there is no outsider

1485
02:00:56,411 --> 02:00:59,957
The coolie in our house
is from another village

1486
02:01:00,040 --> 02:01:03,460
He came here looking for work

1487
02:01:03,543 --> 02:01:07,256
Dad gave him work as he was dumb

1488
02:01:10,175 --> 02:01:12,219
Mokkaiyan!

1489
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:14,221
Mokkaiyan?

1490
02:01:18,016 --> 02:01:20,310
'I've seen him somewhere'

1491
02:01:20,394 --> 02:01:22,938
'Where else would have you
seen a worker of this house?'

1492
02:01:27,442 --> 02:01:30,279
We searched the whole village
But couldn't find him

1493
02:01:33,532 --> 02:01:35,617
Can't you remember
where you saw him

1494
02:01:38,036 --> 02:01:39,830
This cat!

1495
02:01:41,164 --> 02:01:44,334
Next time I'll have
you as my soup

1496
02:01:45,877 --> 02:01:49,381
- What did you say?
- I'll have that cat for my soup

1497
02:01:52,175 --> 02:01:54,386
'If you drink cat soup...'

1498
02:01:59,391 --> 02:02:02,436
Sudamani, bring my bike keys

1499
02:02:04,604 --> 02:02:07,941
We are going to Komalapatti
That's where he should've taken the stone

1500
02:02:19,244 --> 02:02:23,165
Mokka, you have done a fine job

1501
02:02:35,302 --> 02:02:36,386
Master, careful

1502
02:03:15,634 --> 02:03:16,510
Master, the stone

1503
02:04:09,104 --> 02:04:13,066
Have you come to
catch him or the bottle

1504
02:04:13,150 --> 02:04:15,902
Looks like you'll drink
it from there itself

1505
02:04:15,986 --> 02:04:17,612
Come and take it

1506
02:04:20,490 --> 02:04:22,617
I told you to take the stone
not the bottle

1507
02:04:23,076 --> 02:04:24,870
Lift the stone, go

1508
02:04:27,330 --> 02:04:29,040
Careful, man

1509
02:04:29,124 --> 02:04:31,460
Many are searching for this stone

1510
02:04:33,086 --> 02:04:35,881
Shoot them!
Shoot them!

1511
02:04:35,964 --> 02:04:39,426
Don't miss your aim
Shoot them!

1512
02:04:39,509 --> 02:04:40,760
Don't lose the chance

1513
02:04:40,844 --> 02:04:43,805
Munis, you got caught before us?

1514
02:04:43,889 --> 02:04:45,682
How caring you are?

1515
02:04:45,765 --> 02:04:47,851
It's been 2 hours, I am in here

1516
02:04:48,018 --> 02:04:51,146
They would've sold me by now

1517
02:04:51,229 --> 02:04:52,647
Do you know him?

1518
02:04:52,731 --> 02:04:55,609
He is a film star

1519
02:04:55,734 --> 02:04:56,943
No

1520
02:04:57,027 --> 02:05:00,447
He is the Star from the film
Breaking Dawn

1521
02:05:00,489 --> 02:05:05,118
Seeing that movie
my dog bled to death

1522
02:05:05,202 --> 02:05:06,786
Your dog too died

1523
02:05:08,413 --> 02:05:10,790
You are the reason
for my dog's death?

1524
02:05:10,874 --> 02:05:13,126
It's not me

1525
02:05:13,251 --> 02:05:16,421
- Then who?
- My Guru, Steven spiel Kumar

1526
02:05:16,505 --> 02:05:17,631
Steel Kumar?

1527
02:05:17,797 --> 02:05:21,885
- Don't believe them
- Whoever it its...

1528
02:05:21,968 --> 02:05:25,430
We drank Cat soup
Please forgive us for that

1529
02:05:25,514 --> 02:05:27,224
What...cat soup?

1530
02:05:27,307 --> 02:05:29,976
I would have served it today too
But I never give it to my enemy

1531
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:33,396
You should serve
that to your enemy first

1532
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:36,441
Alagu, why does he take Cat soup?

1533
02:05:36,525 --> 02:05:40,070
It would increase your potent

1534
02:05:40,529 --> 02:05:42,906
Why would a broken gun
need a bullet?

1535
02:05:43,532 --> 02:05:44,908
Won't you shut your mouth?

1536
02:05:44,991 --> 02:05:48,537
I meant the gun in your hand
Not you

1537
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:51,122
- Shoot there
- I'll come to you after these 2

1538
02:05:52,832 --> 02:05:55,085
Don't Shoot!
Don't Shoot!

1539
02:05:55,168 --> 02:05:56,753
- Gopi...
- Who is he?

1540
02:06:00,090 --> 02:06:01,883
Come fast

1541
02:06:01,967 --> 02:06:05,053
All those cat soups have
gone in vain

1542
02:06:20,610 --> 02:06:22,279
Wait

1543
02:06:23,071 --> 02:06:29,452
If India cricket team wins
let's ask our sir for foreign liquor

1544
02:07:57,832 --> 02:07:59,668
Come

1545
02:08:03,296 --> 02:08:06,508
Master, is this the time
to watch the cats

1546
02:08:12,472 --> 02:08:13,765
- Gopi!
- What?

1547
02:08:13,848 --> 02:08:17,143
- I forgot the poster
- Come

1548
02:08:17,977 --> 02:08:22,023
Only if he gets shot
he will keep quiet

1549
02:08:26,569 --> 02:08:28,822
You take this from here

1550
02:08:28,905 --> 02:08:33,201
If I touch this they will make a big
issue of me being a schedule caste

1551
02:08:33,284 --> 02:08:37,372
It's Idol only if we take it to our village
If it stays here it's just a stone

1552
02:08:37,455 --> 02:08:38,998
Come

1553
02:08:57,767 --> 02:08:59,644
I've misunderstood you

1554
02:09:00,145 --> 02:09:02,147
Shut up and come

1555
02:09:02,230 --> 02:09:05,191
Don't leave the rope

1556
02:09:12,365 --> 02:09:16,703
You've come back
faster than you went

1557
02:09:17,078 --> 02:09:21,499
That's because of
the gun culture up there

1558
02:09:24,753 --> 02:09:28,465
Is this a bus for both
of us to travel at once

1559
02:09:29,048 --> 02:09:31,885
Don't pull my Leg!
Don't pull my Leg!

1560
02:09:31,968 --> 02:09:33,970
Don't leave me and go

1561
02:09:38,516 --> 02:09:41,603
You've come back
faster than you went

1562
02:09:41,686 --> 02:09:46,441
As you said, that's because
of the gun culture up there

1563
02:09:46,524 --> 02:09:47,609
You too

1564
02:09:47,692 --> 02:09:50,987
He's shooting everything
other than the target

1565
02:10:20,683 --> 02:10:24,103
Come my dear guests...come

1566
02:10:49,838 --> 02:10:52,841
- What happened to this?
- Start it now

1567
02:10:58,096 --> 02:10:59,639
Give me, a Soda

1568
02:11:12,485 --> 02:11:14,153
'Have a long-life'

1569
02:11:14,237 --> 02:11:17,282
Are you the guru
that went to Himalayas?

1570
02:11:17,407 --> 02:11:21,661
You took away his petty shop
Did you think about Mr. Moustache?

1571
02:11:21,995 --> 02:11:24,873
What will we do for our life?

1572
02:11:25,206 --> 02:11:26,875
Eat

1573
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:45,101
"You rose for us from the sun
You're our sole companion"

1574
02:11:45,184 --> 02:11:51,733
"You're our saviour
You're our utmost wealth"

1575
02:11:56,237 --> 02:11:59,449
The photographers have bought the idol

1576
02:12:04,996 --> 02:12:13,046
"You're the healer, worries are
farther when you are with us"

1577
02:12:13,129 --> 02:12:16,925
"Bless the village,
to enthral the folk"

1578
02:12:17,050 --> 02:12:20,428
"And shower us Your grace"

1579
02:12:24,724 --> 02:12:27,894
I have no words to thank you

1580
02:12:27,977 --> 02:12:30,313
You have saved this Mundasupatti

1581
02:12:30,396 --> 02:12:32,815
We are all grateful to you

1582
02:12:37,487 --> 02:12:40,531
Everyone come to the temple!

1583
02:12:44,869 --> 02:12:47,956
I am Spirit of the Sky here

1584
02:12:49,123 --> 02:12:52,460
You didn't do
the Pooja properly

1585
02:12:52,585 --> 02:12:54,671
He is acting as scripted

1586
02:12:54,754 --> 02:12:56,547
We did everything right

1587
02:12:56,631 --> 02:12:59,300
You never did anything

1588
02:12:59,759 --> 02:13:02,887
I can see it in my palm

1589
02:13:02,971 --> 02:13:07,850
The one who saved me
He is my Son! My Son!

1590
02:13:09,727 --> 02:13:12,480
I told you to forgive him
that day

1591
02:13:13,564 --> 02:13:16,985
You punished him
even after that

1592
02:13:18,486 --> 02:13:23,741
You have to satisfy him
Only if you satisfy him I'll cool down

1593
02:13:23,825 --> 02:13:25,618
We'll do as you say

1594
02:13:25,702 --> 02:13:30,331
Whatever he asks for
give it to him immediately

1595
02:13:30,581 --> 02:13:33,334
Don't make a mistake again

1596
02:13:40,591 --> 02:13:45,596
Before the Idol punishes us
Take a decision

1597
02:13:48,141 --> 02:13:54,355
The Idol has ordered us, ask for what
you want, it's our duty to fulfill it

1598
02:13:55,648 --> 02:13:56,649
That is...

1599
02:13:56,733 --> 02:13:59,569
Ask for what you want?
Tell me

1600
02:13:59,652 --> 02:14:01,904
Tell him, master

1601
02:14:04,073 --> 02:14:05,742
I want to marry your girl

1602
02:14:05,825 --> 02:14:07,577
How dare him, uncle!

1603
02:14:10,538 --> 02:14:12,165
Take Shanmugam out of here

1604
02:14:12,248 --> 02:14:15,460
He just wanted to help your
village by marrying that girl

1605
02:14:15,543 --> 02:14:19,630
But he is talking over his limits
My master isn't satisfied

1606
02:14:19,714 --> 02:14:21,090
Let's leave

1607
02:14:21,174 --> 02:14:23,718
Son, don't be in a hurry

1608
02:14:23,801 --> 02:14:26,179
We'll talk about it
and take a decision

1609
02:14:31,434 --> 02:14:34,187
Help!
Help!

1610
02:14:36,355 --> 02:14:41,277
You acted as a dumb in the village
but your sound tears my ear drums

1611
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:47,283
I knew it when I saw you
overacting at work

1612
02:14:47,992 --> 02:14:49,494
Give me the match box

1613
02:14:49,577 --> 02:14:51,788
Locking me in a box!

1614
02:14:51,871 --> 02:14:54,874
Did you see me how I came from it?

1615
02:14:55,917 --> 02:15:00,129
How did you break that
lock and rob the Idol?

1616
02:15:00,213 --> 02:15:02,632
When did we break the lock!

1617
02:15:02,715 --> 02:15:06,010
Those photographers in your village

1618
02:15:06,094 --> 02:15:08,971
- They only opened the locks
- What do you mean?

1619
02:15:09,055 --> 02:15:15,311
That photographer to marry the village
chief hid the idol in the school

1620
02:15:15,394 --> 02:15:18,856
I robbed it from there

1621
02:15:20,108 --> 02:15:24,904
You fooled me then the villagers
and at last even the Idol

1622
02:15:24,987 --> 02:15:29,117
So the Photographer is
the mastermind behind all this

1623
02:15:30,201 --> 02:15:32,912
I'll see their end
You Photographers!

1624
02:15:39,794 --> 02:15:41,754
We have a set of rules
for our village

1625
02:15:41,838 --> 02:15:44,549
We never speak against
Spirit of the Skies decision

1626
02:15:44,632 --> 02:15:47,885
So you can marry Kalaivani

1627
02:15:49,345 --> 02:15:53,516
This doesn't seem right
Don't decide in a haste

1628
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:56,686
This is Idol's decision
We have to go with it

1629
02:15:56,769 --> 02:16:01,232
This doesn't seem fair

1630
02:16:01,315 --> 02:16:03,818
Whatever it is
come to a conclusion soon

1631
02:16:03,901 --> 02:16:08,656
Can't you all see why the marriage was
stopped twice it's all Idols play

1632
02:16:09,407 --> 02:16:12,118
- Gopi, is my son-in-law
- Don't make me furious

1633
02:16:12,201 --> 02:16:15,079
This is Idol's decision
don't go against it

1634
02:16:15,913 --> 02:16:17,748
Mind your words

1635
02:16:18,624 --> 02:16:19,750
Get out

1636
02:16:22,420 --> 02:16:24,130
Go,son

1637
02:16:24,213 --> 02:16:25,840
Move

1638
02:16:27,550 --> 02:16:30,511
So the leader has said it
Get on with the marriage works

1639
02:16:30,595 --> 02:16:33,556
Go off before he slaps you

1640
02:16:34,182 --> 02:16:37,268
Nothing would be
possible without Guruji

1641
02:16:37,351 --> 02:16:39,020
Have a long-life

1642
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:44,275
Distribute to everyone

1643
02:16:46,527 --> 02:16:51,240
Guruji, please find my petty shop

1644
02:17:01,584 --> 02:17:03,961
Have a happy married life

1645
02:17:05,880 --> 02:17:08,549
I have to hand over one thing to you

1646
02:17:08,633 --> 02:17:11,219
Bring that camera

1647
02:17:11,302 --> 02:17:12,970
Oh camera?

1648
02:17:13,596 --> 02:17:15,473
I won't leave you

1649
02:17:17,308 --> 02:17:20,353
Good, they didn't bury this

1650
02:17:23,981 --> 02:17:26,192
They'll never come good

1651
02:17:26,984 --> 02:17:30,821
Come inside, Only if they take
it outside it's dangerous

1652
02:17:30,905 --> 02:17:34,200
Nothing like that, we are
here to get some fresh air

1653
02:17:34,283 --> 02:17:36,869
You villagers are very funny

1654
02:17:38,621 --> 02:17:42,291
My only girl
Please don't photograph her

1655
02:17:42,375 --> 02:17:44,418
Hey-“groom!

1656
02:17:44,794 --> 02:17:47,838
- Ganesa, what's the crowd about?
- The Photographers wedding just got over

1657
02:17:47,922 --> 02:17:48,965
ls the marriage over?

1658
02:17:49,048 --> 02:17:50,424
- I am going for the feast?
- Where?

1659
02:17:50,508 --> 02:17:51,801
They serve milk pudding also

1660
02:17:52,343 --> 02:17:56,472
You were the one spoiling me

1661
02:17:59,642 --> 02:18:02,478
The Photographer has deceived us all

1662
02:18:05,314 --> 02:18:08,609
Did he marry our girl?

1663
02:18:08,693 --> 02:18:10,069
Hey man...!

1664
02:18:10,152 --> 02:18:13,030
What do you mean?
Can't understand

1665
02:18:22,039 --> 02:18:24,041
What happened to you?

1666
02:18:24,125 --> 02:18:26,836
The Photographer is
the one who hid the Idol

1667
02:18:26,919 --> 02:18:28,796
You made him your son-in-law?

1668
02:18:28,879 --> 02:18:31,841
- Idol
- Yes!

1669
02:18:31,924 --> 02:18:34,760
- Spirit of the Sky
- Spirit of the Sky!

1670
02:18:37,930 --> 02:18:41,058
Why are you talking to the wall?
They are escaping here

1671
02:18:41,142 --> 02:18:43,936
The photographer is
eloping with my girl

1672
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:46,314
It's our girl who's eloping

1673
02:18:46,397 --> 02:18:48,316
Our girl

1674
02:18:49,025 --> 02:18:51,569
Come everybody

1675
02:18:52,278 --> 02:18:55,489
You keep fainting
like a pregnant women

1676
02:18:55,740 --> 02:18:57,950
Catch them

1677
02:18:58,034 --> 02:19:00,244
I can confront anyone

1678
02:19:00,328 --> 02:19:03,080
lam not going to
let you escape this time

1679
02:19:15,384 --> 02:19:18,512
Run fast, they're nearing us

1680
02:19:25,936 --> 02:19:27,646
Go fast

1681
02:19:38,991 --> 02:19:41,243
This way

1682
02:19:41,452 --> 02:19:43,329
Follow them

1683
02:19:43,871 --> 02:19:47,249
Uncle, come fast

1684
02:19:50,544 --> 02:19:52,254
Get on

1685
02:20:07,603 --> 02:20:11,107
This Photographer has come
to make us run

1686
02:20:11,232 --> 02:20:14,902
Are you riding triples?
I won't leave you

1687
02:20:16,153 --> 02:20:18,781
Look how fast
this bike is going now

1688
02:20:18,906 --> 02:20:22,243
Agnate, help me out

1689
02:20:22,326 --> 02:20:24,995
Come fast!
Come fast!

1690
02:20:25,871 --> 02:20:28,874
He's driving it in his legs

1691
02:20:33,462 --> 02:20:37,174
- Go fast they are coming
- What happened?

1692
02:20:37,258 --> 02:20:39,510
You know about this bike
Get down

1693
02:20:39,593 --> 02:20:41,637
Push it!
push it!

1694
02:20:43,556 --> 02:20:45,182
Push it man

1695
02:20:46,308 --> 02:20:50,104
Can't push anymore
Drop the bike

1696
02:20:50,271 --> 02:20:53,441
Come quickly!

1697
02:21:15,004 --> 02:21:16,755
They've come close to us

1698
02:21:17,631 --> 02:21:21,260
Let's run away, master

1699
02:21:21,844 --> 02:21:24,847
What happened to you, master?

1700
02:21:24,930 --> 02:21:29,059
You idiot, it is the climax for you now

1701
02:21:30,686 --> 02:21:34,482
What's with the style?
They have neared us

1702
02:21:37,359 --> 02:21:38,402
Tell me

1703
02:21:38,486 --> 02:21:40,446
Take out the Camera

1704
02:21:52,541 --> 02:21:55,419
Stop!
Stop!

1705
02:21:59,924 --> 02:22:01,842
Lets go back
before they photograph us

1706
02:22:01,926 --> 02:22:04,803
You aren't photogenic

1707
02:22:04,887 --> 02:22:07,139
Come, we'll go catch them

1708
02:22:07,223 --> 02:22:09,725
Why are you catching me?

1709
02:22:13,812 --> 02:22:16,398
He is taking photographs of all of us

1710
02:22:30,412 --> 02:22:33,374
He has lit up Mundasupatti

1711
02:22:52,393 --> 02:22:56,480
Direction
Ram Kumar

1712
02:23:02,528 --> 02:23:04,822
They can't escape
We'll catch them

1713
02:23:04,905 --> 02:23:06,824
I'll slap you, idiot

1714
02:23:06,907 --> 02:23:09,285
Put that sickle down

1715
02:23:09,368 --> 02:23:11,412
You glutton!

1716
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:24,675
Stop

1717
02:23:24,842 --> 02:23:26,552
Where are you going?

1718
02:23:26,635 --> 02:23:29,430
I won't leave alive
that photographer

1719
02:23:29,930 --> 02:23:31,640
You can't

1720
02:23:31,724 --> 02:23:34,310
They've already escaped

1721
02:23:34,393 --> 02:23:37,605
Don't put the sickle on my legs

1722
02:23:37,688 --> 02:23:39,648
Oh God! He did it

1723
02:23:39,773 --> 02:23:42,192
Bring him along with you

1724
02:23:59,627 --> 02:24:03,922
"You are our king of kings"

1725
02:24:04,048 --> 02:24:09,511
"Where has your kingdom vanished?"

1726
02:24:09,762 --> 02:24:14,642
"You lived through our eyes
Where have you left us"

1727
02:24:14,725 --> 02:24:19,647
"Oh king of kings!"

1728
02:24:19,730 --> 02:24:24,193
"You are our Queen of queens"

1729
02:24:24,443 --> 02:24:29,031
"The one who took the breath away"

1730
02:24:29,907 --> 02:24:34,870
"I've whispered our desires
through your ears"

1731
02:24:34,953 --> 02:24:39,583
"You are the queen of nectars"

1732
02:24:43,921 --> 02:24:46,090
Before 1 hour...

1733
02:24:46,882 --> 02:24:48,676
Stop there

1734
02:24:48,759 --> 02:24:52,596
- Where are you going?
- I'll catch that photographer

1735
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:54,390
What are you saying?

1736
02:24:54,473 --> 02:24:57,768
They are running violently
You might get run over

1737
02:24:57,851 --> 02:25:00,521
I'll definitely catch him

1738
02:25:00,813 --> 02:25:01,689
Go

1739
02:25:01,772 --> 02:25:03,982
We must catch them

1740
02:25:04,066 --> 02:25:05,901
Go ahead
