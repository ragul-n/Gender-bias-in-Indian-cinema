2
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,583
Pranay!

3
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:23,250
Manju.

4
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,292
You go ahead.

5
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,750
They are too close.

6
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:27,750
What about you?

7
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,292
I will try to distract them.

8
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,792
Please take the children and leave.

9
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,417
-I'll meet you later.
-No! Come with us.

10
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,917
Take the children and leave!

11
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,833
I said, go! I'll see you later.

12
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,083
Mom! Where is Dad?

13
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,500
Dad will follow us. Come on, let's go.

14
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,333
Mom! Dad?

15
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,125
He will be fine. Let's go!

16
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,542
Come on.

17
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:05,333
Sister!

18
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,292
Listen up.

19
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,667
Until I return,

20
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,875
consider yourself as his mother.

21
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:13,750
And you are the man of the house.

22
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,708
-I'm going back to get your father.
-No, Mom.

23
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:20,542
-Just follow the group.
-No, Mom. Don't leave us!

24
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:21,708
Manju!

25
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:23,375
What's wrong? Be quick!

26
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,167
I will be with you, every second.

27
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,833
I will come and find you.

28
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,417
I promise!

29
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,000
Go with the villagers.

30
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:33,542
Promise me.

31
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,583
Promise me that you
won't leave the group.

32
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,167
Stay with them.

33
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,917
And protect each other.

34
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,083
Promise me.

35
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,333
-We promise.
-Promise.

36
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,000
Sister.

37
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,292
Take care of my children.

38
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:51,458
I need to go back

39
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,583
for their father.

40
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,417
Go.

41
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,250
Come with me. Come on.

42
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:02,958
Mom!

43
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,250
What are my children doing?

44
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,625
Have some food.

45
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,542
Please eat well.

46
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,083
Hey!

47
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,542
Why are you not eating? Please eat.

48
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:13,917
You'll be strong only if you eat.

49
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:17,125
Only the strong ones can survive.

50
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,000
Remember one thing.

51
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,333
The strong ones live
while the rest perish.

52
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:34,375
This rice beer keeps my old bones
from rusting.

53
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,875
Have you ever heard of it?

54
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:41,458
Even the yeti loves this rice beer.

55
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:45,292
But my teacher says
that yetis don't exist.

56
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,417
Nonsense! Your teacher knows nothing.

57
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,167
I have seen him with my very own eyes.

58
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:51,667
What does he look like?

59
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,417
He is tall and scary.

60
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,292
You will look like mere bugs
in front of him.

61
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:00,500
He is covered with white hair.

62
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,250
Long and gross.

63
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,000
He looks like an ape.

64
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:08,167
But walks like a man.

65
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,500
Usually, he resides in the mountains.

66
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,417
No one sees him.

67
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,250
Where did you see him?

68
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,833
I saw him at our village.

69
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,500
He was this close.

70
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,875
This close!

71
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,208
Damn!

72
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:24,333
He could've killed me with a single punch.

73
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,875
But, he didn't.

74
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,250
Do you know why?

75
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,083
Because he could smell the aroma
of my rice beer.

76
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:37,375
My father had brewed
a particularly good batch.

77
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,458
That scoundrel!

78
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:43,000
He snatched my beer and
ran back to the mountains.

79
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,667
If it weren't for this rice beer,
I would've been--

80
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:51,167
Brother! Will you stop
scaring the children?

81
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,875
Shut up!

82
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,917
The rice beer helps me
battle the cold as well.

83
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,625
It is not just a beer.

84
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:01,500
It is pure magic.

85
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:07,083
Children, finish your food.

86
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:14,542
I've made myself clear, I won't go.

87
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,750
Why, Uncle? What is the problem?

88
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,583
People of Sikkim are quite nice.

89
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,667
I have been to Pelling once.

90
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,167
We'll find employment there.

91
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,208
Moreover, our relatives are also there.

92
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,125
They can help us.

93
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,958
-There's a church over there.
-Church?

94
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,875
You think the church will help us?

95
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:32,750
You are much more stupid than I thought.

96
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:37,625
I think the Christians
are extremely nasty.

97
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,167
-Monsters!
-Uncle, please!

98
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:41,583
Don't talk rubbish.

99
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:42,667
Trust me.

100
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,375
They try to make you forget your
own beliefs and your own religion.

101
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,583
Really?

102
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,458
Uncle, stop scaring them.

103
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,792
They should be scared.

104
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,917
They are very strange.

105
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,958
They make you eat all sorts of
weird things. It is disgusting!

106
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,917
Have you seen their priests?

107
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,792
They wear long gowns...

108
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,458
so that they can kidnap the children.

109
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,542
After kidnapping the children,

110
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,083
they turn them into slaves
in the name of God.

111
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
-Uncle--
-Shush! Let him speak.

112
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,833
And they eat infants.

113
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,083
First, they feed them a lot.

114
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,125
And then, they eat them up.

115
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:21,292
Those monsters!

116
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:22,583
Don't listen to him.

117
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,125
-He is talking rubbish.
-He is my brother.

118
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,417
I love him more than my life.

119
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,375
But he does speak nonsense, at times.

120
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,458
Please trust me.

121
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,167
They are not monsters.

122
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,875
So, Pelling it is.

123
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,042
I warn you.

124
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,708
They are demons.

125
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,542
They will eat your children.

126
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:45,542
I'm not going to any church out there.

127
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,458
You know what surprises me?

128
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:32,292
They say, he killed his own family.

129
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,000
Then, he shot himself in the back.

130
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,125
Does that make any sense?

131
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:45,208
Are we idiots to believe such nonsense?

132
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,250
Listen up.

133
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,000
Last night they were discussing
about the place we are headed to.

134
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,833
-Where are we going?
-Pelling.

135
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,250
-So?
-We are going to a church.

136
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,458
-Is that bad?
-Yes.

137
00:12:58,917 --> 00:12:59,875
Why?

138
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,417
There are monsters there.

139
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,833
-Monsters?
-Yes.

140
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:05,583
The priests!

141
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:06,875
Priests?

142
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,750
They have magical powers.

143
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,292
They make us forget
our beliefs and our religion.

144
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,875
Why would they do that?

145
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,208
They eat babies.

146
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,542
-They eat babies--
-Shush!

147
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,458
-They eat babies?
-Yes!

148
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:25,792
They turn children into slaves
and then they eat them.

149
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:28,292
Then, why are the villagers going there?

150
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,792
Maybe because they are not children.

151
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,542
We can't go with them.

152
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,000
But mother insisted that we
should never leave the group.

153
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,292
Mother also said that we
need to protect each other.

154
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,000
But, where will we go?

155
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,125
Anywhere but the church.

156
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,792
But first, we need to make sure
that Bishal is with us.

157
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,417
Amrita.

158
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:14,875
You want me to hold him?

159
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,250
No, I'm fine.

160
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,292
Okay. Let's go.

161
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,625
Pranay. Amrita.

162
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,292
What are you doing?

163
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,917
Quickly, now. Keep up the pace.

164
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,500
It's ahead.

165
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,125
It's behind us.

166
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,750
I know everything. Just walk.

167
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,500
-Greetings!
-Greetings.

168
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,208
Where is Pelling church?

169
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:53,417
Oh, it's down there. Behind you.

170
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,792
You've come way ahead.
You've entered the town.

171
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,833
Just go back a hundred meters
and take a left.

172
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,917
The path is a bit rough though.

173
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,833
-Okay, thanks a lot.
-Thank you.

174
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,583
Where are you coming from?

175
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,125
Daalpur.

176
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,500
Oh! That's quite far. You must be tired.

177
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,750
Can I get you some water or tea?

178
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,375
No, that's okay.

179
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:19,250
-We are in a hurry. Thank you so much.
-Goodbye.

180
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:24,875
Bikram!

181
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,292
Where are the children?

182
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,500
I think we lost them.

183
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,917
I think so. But we should keep moving.

184
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,417
What happened?

185
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,042
Where will we go?

186
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:11,458
Where will we stay?

187
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,458
I wonder where our mother is.

188
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:16,500
Hey, I am here!
We will find a safe place.

189
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:20,042
Amrita, why did we have to leave home?

190
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,625
If we hadn't, those people
would have killed us.

191
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,583
Why?

192
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,750
Who are they?

193
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,625
Did we do something wrong?

194
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,667
No, we didn't do anything wrong.

195
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,417
Brother, we need to take care of Bishal.

196
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,042
Please don't cry.

197
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:43,417
Come on.

198
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,333
Pranay, let's find a place to rest.

199
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:50,583
We have to feed Bishal.

200
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,333
Pulses.

201
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,292
Beaten rice.

202
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,333
Sugar.

203
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:01,458
Banana.

204
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,708
Apple.

205
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,625
Biscuit and kerosene.

206
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,042
That should suffice for a few days.

207
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,875
If food runs out,
we have some money as well.

208
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:12,958
But we don't have clothes.

209
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:16,417
We have clothes for Bishal. That's enough.

210
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,250
We won't have to use it.

211
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,583
What?

212
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,333
The money.

213
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:27,875
Why?

214
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:31,667
Mom will find us before that.

215
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,417
That's true.

216
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,208
-Amrita.
-Yes?

217
00:17:37,917 --> 00:17:39,833
Let's find a place to sleep.

218
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,917
It's about to get cold.

219
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,208
Come, I'll wrap the baby around you.

220
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,000
Mom will find us, right?

221
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,000
Of course she will.

222
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,333
Are you hungry?

223
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,792
Amrita.

224
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,000
Do you think our father...

225
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:09,417
Brother. You like bananas, don't you?

226
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,875
It's going to get cold.

227
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,375
We can close the windows.

228
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,625
It will still be cold.

229
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,708
Pranay.

230
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:02,958
Pranay.

231
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:04,250
Pranay!

232
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,167
Pranay!

233
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,500
-What?
-I need to go.

234
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,375
Pranay!

235
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,667
What?

236
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:14,208
Where to?

237
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,625
I need to pee.

238
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,958
-Right now?
-Yes.

239
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,667
-Outside?
-Yes.

240
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,333
-In the dark?
-Yes!

241
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:26,292
You know I'm afraid of the dark.

242
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,500
I know.

243
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,333
But I can't go alone.

244
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,125
Go ahead.

245
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,500
In front of you?

246
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,208
Go behind the bushes.

247
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,333
Why couldn't you hold it until morning?

248
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,667
Dear God!

249
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,125
What if the priest comes?

250
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,125
Let him come.

251
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,208
I will beat the life out of him.

252
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,167
What was that sound?

253
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,375
Nothing.

254
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,958
What was it?

255
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:23,958
I hit the tree.

256
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,375
Why?

257
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,042
To scare the priest.

258
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,417
Is there a priest here?

259
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:30,375
No.

260
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,583
Then, stop scaring me.

261
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,042
What?

262
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,167
The flame is too bright.

263
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,667
Someone could find us.

264
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,375
We have to put it out.

265
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,708
But, how?

266
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:02,792
Take Bishal.

267
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,625
Hurry!

268
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,375
So, there's no fire inside?

269
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,333
No.

270
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:28,542
Now what?

271
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:32,750
We wait for the smoke to clear off.
Then, we sleep.

272
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,042
Lately, I've been thinking.

273
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:45,167
Why do these Christians
make us forget our Gods?

274
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:47,042
I have no idea.

275
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,375
All I know is that I don't
want to get caught.

276
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,542
They make us forget our religion

277
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,917
so that we are unable
to pray to our Gods and escape.

278
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,292
Get down.

279
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:31,000
What happened?

280
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:32,917
-We need to hide.
-Why?

281
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,875
It's a priest from the church.

282
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,417
Priest?

283
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,333
Are you sure?

284
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:47,417
The old man said that
they wear black robes.

285
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,750
And a cross as well.

286
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,042
What's a cross?

287
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,250
Fingers?

288
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,875
-No!
-Then?

289
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,083
It is made of gold or something.

290
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:06,875
Where do you think he is going?

291
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,708
He might be looking for children, I guess.

292
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:20,083
We have to be careful.
He might come back.

293
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,375
We need to clean this place up.

294
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:33,250
And the windows need to get dirty
so that he can't see through.

295
00:24:54,042 --> 00:24:58,125
<i>Our hearts beat faster</i>
<i>With every passing second</i>

296
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:04,167
<i>Oh Mother, where are you?</i>

297
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,875
<i>As evening comes, our hearts start crying</i>

298
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,500
<i>Oh Mother, please come and console us</i>

299
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:21,792
<i>But we still go about our lives</i>

300
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:28,083
<i>That is what we have to do</i>

301
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,125
<i>Tomorrow is an unsolved mystery</i>

302
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:36,417
<i>Today is a gift to embrace</i>

303
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,792
<i>Glimpses of your face</i>
<i>Appear again and again</i>

304
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:51,000
<i>Your sweet voice echoes, Oh Mother</i>

305
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:53,958
<i>Oh Mother</i>

306
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:57,083
<i>Oh Mother</i>

307
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,917
<i>Oh Mother</i>

308
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,458
<i>We came to find peace</i>
<i>Instead, we found emptiness</i>

309
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:29,042
<i>We don't know where we are headed</i>

310
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:35,417
<i>How? Why? What happened?</i>

311
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:40,875
<i>No answers</i>
<i>But the questions are too many</i>

312
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:46,708
<i>But we still go about our lives</i>

313
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:52,500
<i>That is what we have to do</i>

314
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:56,958
<i>Tomorrow is an unsolved mystery</i>

315
00:26:57,042 --> 00:27:01,208
<i>Today is a gift to embrace</i>

316
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:16,042
<i>Oh Mother</i>

317
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,917
<i>Oh Mother</i>

318
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,958
<i>Oh Mother</i>

319
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:24,500
<i>Oh Mother</i>

320
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,583
-What are you doing?
-Shush!

321
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,000
Catching a rabbit.

322
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,292
-Can you?
-Yes, if we remain quiet.

323
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,333
Have you done this before?

324
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:57,500
Yes. Now, keep quiet!

325
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,542
-When?
-Long ago.

326
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,833
-With whom?
-I saw Bikram catch one.

327
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,042
Now, stop talking!

328
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,458
But you haven't done it yourself.

329
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,583
Bikram taught me.

330
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,125
Please shut up now!

331
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,667
I don't think it will work.

332
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,583
It will, if you keep quiet.

333
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,208
I don't think--

334
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:26,958
Why can't you keep your mouth shut?

335
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,667
-How can we ever--
-Shush!

336
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:36,583
Yes!

337
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:40,208
<i>Hurray!</i>

338
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:44,250
<i>Hurray!</i>

339
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,083
-Amrita.
-Yes?

340
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,458
-Now what?
-Now, we can cook it.

341
00:28:48,875 --> 00:28:49,833
How?

342
00:28:50,417 --> 00:28:52,042
First, we have to...

343
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:54,833
kill it.

344
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:58,167
You do it.

345
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:17,917
Bishal.

346
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,875
Animals are our friends.

347
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,500
We should love them.

348
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,750
We should not eat them.

349
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,583
If we eat their flesh,

350
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,708
we would be evil, like the priest.

351
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,583
Brother, let him go.

352
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:34,792
Why?

353
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,625
He could be our pet.

354
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,542
He might have a family.

355
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,292
And a mother, right?

356
00:29:45,542 --> 00:29:47,542
Will his mother find him?

357
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,875
Mothers always do.

358
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,083
I think he has peed.

359
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,625
No, I already checked.

360
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,292
Hungry, maybe?

361
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,667
What's wrong with him?

362
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:42,000
Let's swing him.

363
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,542
No, this isn't working.

364
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:50,250
Why are you crying, Baby?

365
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,917
Please tell me.

366
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:55,083
Where is it hurting?

367
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:56,500
Here?

368
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,292
Here?

369
00:30:58,917 --> 00:30:59,833
Here?

370
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:02,792
His stomach is hurting.

371
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,083
How do you know?

372
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:06,375
I know. Go out and ignite the fire.

373
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,583
Me? Outside?

374
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,542
Okay. You stay with him.

375
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:13,792
I'll go.

376
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,917
Don't worry, Baby.

377
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,250
Sister will use her magical powers

378
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,875
and cure you, instantly.

379
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,250
What's causing the pain?

380
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:49,500
The little brat just needed to fart.

381
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,708
Bishal farted!

382
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:53,417
Bishal farted!

383
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,125
Fart as much as you want.

384
00:31:56,542 --> 00:32:00,500
My dirty brother! My little fart machine!

385
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,750
Now, this is too much!

386
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,542
Fart as much as you want, Bishal.

387
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,792
Suntali, get down.

388
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,125
Suntali!

389
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,375
Get down before I decide to come up.

390
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,917
Come here.

391
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,417
We need to go home now.

392
00:33:11,542 --> 00:33:12,833
Come down, fast.

393
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,833
Be careful. She is a naughty one.

394
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,208
Come on.

395
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,500
Careful.

396
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,333
Good job, Kid!

397
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,708
-What is your name?
-Pranay.

398
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:34,750
Pranay?

399
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,333
Thank you, Pranay.

400
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:38,417
I've been trying to get her down
since an hour.

401
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,125
Don't know what I would have done
without you.

402
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:42,958
Where do you live?

403
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,125
Nearby.

404
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,833
Really?

405
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:50,625
When I was young,

406
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:53,542
I could catch a flying bird.

407
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,208
I guess old age...

408
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,792
catches up with everyone.

409
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,667
Are you new here?

410
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,542
-Never seem to have seen you before.
-Yes.

411
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:08,417
Now, taking the goats out to graze
is also getting difficult for me.

412
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,542
Why do you do it then?

413
00:34:10,792 --> 00:34:12,583
-Do what?
-Taking the goats out to graze.

414
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,583
Well, they have to graze.

415
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,958
They need to eat.

416
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,042
Ask someone else to do it.

417
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,708
You are very old.

418
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:22,042
Old people should take rest.

419
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:25,333
Yes, I am old.
But, there is no one to help.

420
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,125
What about your family?

421
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,875
I do have a wife.

422
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,000
But she is older than me.

423
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,792
Don't tell her I said so.
She might slap me.

424
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,167
You don't have children?

425
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:42,083
My son...

426
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,750
took the goats out to graze one day.

427
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,750
The goats returned home. He didn't.

428
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:50,333
He didn't return?

429
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,292
Didn't you look for him?

430
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:53,792
I looked for him everywhere!

431
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,750
Now these goats only have me.

432
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,750
If you don't mind,

433
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,917
I can take these goats out to graze.

434
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,958
-Really?
-Yes.

435
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,542
I can do it for you.

436
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:08,417
You are very old.

437
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,708
You should rest.

438
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:13,958
Not sure if I should be
grateful for the help

439
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:16,042
or feel insulted
because you called me old.

440
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,083
Show me where you stay.

441
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,708
I'll come tomorrow
and take the goats out.

442
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,417
I know how to do it.

443
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,375
I am sure you do.

444
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,750
You look like a smart boy.

445
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:33,417
Come Birkhe, Harke,
Furba, Suntali, Kanchi.

446
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:35,292
Let's go home now.

447
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,500
Even I am getting hungry.

448
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,333
This boy must be hungry too.

449
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:55,083
Where were you?

450
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:56,500
You know how worried I was?

451
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,458
What if the priest had come?

452
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:00,208
I followed him.

453
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,208
Idiot!

454
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,583
What if he had kidnapped you?

455
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,792
Oh! I didn't think about that.

456
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,208
Stupid!

457
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:09,583
What is that?

458
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,750
I got a job.

459
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:13,417
This is my salary.

460
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:19,417
His son never returned?

461
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,833
I think the priest took him.

462
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,958
Poor guy!

463
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:27,000
-That is horrible!
-Exactly.

464
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,792
Poor old man.

465
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:17,250
Why don't they come back?

466
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,667
Who?

467
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:22,042
The children that are not eaten.

468
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:26,667
Why don't they return, once they grow up?

469
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,625
If they can make you forget your Gods,

470
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:38,292
maybe they make you
forget your family too.

471
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:40,750
Pranay.

472
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:42,875
We can't get caught.

473
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:46,708
Mother will be heart broken
if we forget her.

474
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,458
I miss our mother.

475
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,917
She will find us, right?

476
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,167
Of course she will.

477
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,750
If she was here, you know
what she would have said?

478
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,042
Finish your food!

479
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,958
And wash your dishes after eating.

480
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:09,292
But she is not here,
so I will do it tomorrow.

481
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,917
Lazy bum!

482
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:22,208
What happened?

483
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,792
From now on, I will do the dishes.

484
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,542
Yeah, right!

485
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:44,625
-You know what our mother used to say?
-What?

486
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,875
If we were to eat in the
dishes washed by you,

487
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,542
we would die of some disease.

488
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,333
You are lying.

489
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:51,750
I'm telling you the truth.

490
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:54,333
Why do you think she never let you?

491
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,750
Because I am a boy.

492
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,583
You wish!

493
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:09,208
Baje, I've got all the goats back.

494
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,042
Baje!

495
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:18,042
Pranay, wait! I'm getting you some milk.

496
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,167
Here you go.

497
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:23,750
Is this knife sharp enough?

498
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,125
Yes, very sharp.

499
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,292
-Can I borrow it for a day?
-Why?

500
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:30,792
I have a task.

501
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:31,833
What task?

502
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:34,583
-Please listen to me.
-I am listening to you.

503
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,708
I need a knife.

504
00:40:37,917 --> 00:40:39,667
A long bamboo.

505
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:42,250
Few stones.

506
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,417
And a long rope.

507
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:45,500
Anything else?

508
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,375
-Nothing else.
-That's it?

509
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,000
-Can I see now?
-Not yet!

510
00:40:56,042 --> 00:40:58,958
-What are you doing?
-You'll see.

511
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,500
-Can I see now?
-No.

512
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:04,083
-Now?
-No!

513
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,375
Come with me.

514
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,250
Now.

515
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:17,708
Whoa!

516
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,500
Now you won't hurt yourself.

517
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:25,125
-You made this?
-Yes.

518
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:28,583
-For me?
-Yes.

519
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:30,917
Pranay.

520
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:33,750
You've become responsible
like the man of the house ought to be.

521
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:38,833
-The bamboo was very heavy.
-Shush!

522
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,042
Listen carefully.

523
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:42,667
What?

524
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,708
Music?

525
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:47,875
Where do you think the
sound is coming from?

526
00:41:48,792 --> 00:41:50,958
It is very pleasant!

527
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,542
What happened?

528
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,292
Nothing serious. The kerosene is over.

529
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:08,833
I'm afraid of the dark.

530
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,708
Stop acting like a baby.

531
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:13,708
Stop it.

532
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:16,458
Tomorrow, I'll go and get some kerosene.

533
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:19,583
We are running out of food as well.

534
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:22,875
Come, sit next to me.

535
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,833
Come here!

536
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:34,875
<i>Pretty little baby, a treasure of love</i>

537
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:38,583
<i>May you keep smiling forever</i>

538
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:44,375
<i>Beyond the rainbow,</i>
<i>There's a kingdom of colors</i>

539
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:48,167
<i>There's also a bright moon in the sky</i>

540
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:54,458
<i>The night sky is painted</i>
<i>With the moonlight</i>

541
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:58,583
<i>Looks like a beautiful fair</i>

542
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:04,250
<i>Go to that fair and sit on a train</i>

543
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:07,917
<i>That train shall take you</i>
<i>To your dreamland</i>

544
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:14,000
<i>Go to that fair and sit on a train</i>

545
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:17,042
<i>That train shall take you</i>
<i>To your dreamland</i>

546
00:43:58,833 --> 00:43:59,875
Good morning.

547
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Hi. How are you?

548
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,583
I'm alright now.

549
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:06,375
But, it's getting difficult.

550
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:09,625
Even something as simple as getting
a glass of water, is very tough for me.

551
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,750
Has the doctor given you a due date?

552
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:14,083
He said it could be anytime
after a month and a half.

553
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:16,208
-Just around the corner.
-Yes.

554
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:17,500
How's your husband?

555
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:19,875
As usual, busy with work.

556
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,625
He travels quite often.

557
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,375
All husbands are the same.

558
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,625
Can I get a Colgate?

559
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,542
One Colgate, for the lady.

560
00:44:35,583 --> 00:44:37,208
Thank you.

561
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:38,750
Auntie.

562
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:41,625
My stuff?

563
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:43,875
Seventy rupees.

564
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,417
Seventy rupees.

565
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,167
This is Nepalese currency.

566
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,958
This currency is not Indian.

567
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,125
The note doesn't contain
Mahatma Gandhi's picture.

568
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,417
But money is money.

569
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:07,792
Yes, but this isn't IC.

570
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,167
-IC?
-Indian Currency.

571
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,500
-This won't do?
-No, it won't.

572
00:45:31,583 --> 00:45:32,583
Child!

573
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:34,458
Can you pick this up for me?

574
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:37,958
Thank you.

575
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:41,708
Auntie, I can help you
with all your chores.

576
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:42,750
What?

577
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:47,750
I heard you tell that lady
that work is getting difficult for you.

578
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,750
I am quite skilled.

579
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:53,042
Why would a young girl like you
need to work?

580
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,917
I need IC.

581
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:56,083
IC?

582
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,500
Indian Currency.

583
00:45:57,708 --> 00:46:00,208
To buy food and kerosene.

584
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:03,542
My brother is scared of the dark.

585
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,583
Scared of the dark?

586
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:07,708
Where are your parents?

587
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,375
Are you alone here?

588
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:10,667
Not at all.

589
00:46:10,792 --> 00:46:13,583
My father is away.

590
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:17,250
And my mother is ill.

591
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,708
Oh, she is ill. I see!

592
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:20,833
Will you hire me?

593
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,458
Okay.

594
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:26,667
Come on.

595
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:33,583
Let's go to my place.
I'll show you around.

596
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:39,792
Come.

597
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:41,000
Come in.

598
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:44,458
Whoa!

599
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:48,458
You like the house?

600
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:50,833
-A lot!
-A lot?

601
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:57,750
-Want some water?
-No.

602
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,417
-Who else lives with you, in your house?
-I live with my two brothers.

603
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:08,042
My ill mother.

604
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,500
And my father.

605
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:11,833
But he is away.

606
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:13,625
Do you go to school?

607
00:47:13,708 --> 00:47:15,792
Absolutely. I study in class three.

608
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,958
I am the best student in my class.

609
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:19,125
Really?

610
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:21,083
-Which School?
-K.C. School.

611
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:22,667
K.C. School?

612
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:25,958
Not around here, is it?

613
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:29,750
It is quite far.

614
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:32,083
I walk for hours, everyday.

615
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:35,292
Nowadays I need to look
after my brother as well.

616
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:39,917
-But your studies are important.
-Yes.

617
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:42,167
Once my mother is alright,

618
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,458
I'll start going to school again.

619
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:45,667
Alright.

620
00:47:50,083 --> 00:47:51,292
Here.

621
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:56,375
Weren't you at the shop to buy some food?

622
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,708
And you need money for kerosene as well.

623
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,875
IC.

624
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:01,125
Indian Currency?

625
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:02,583
Here.

626
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:04,583
Take it.

627
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:08,958
This is your advance salary.

628
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,875
Here.

629
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:13,958
-May I take your leave?
-Yes.

630
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:08,833
What happened?

631
00:49:09,167 --> 00:49:10,833
-Didn't you see him?
-See who?

632
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:13,333
-The priest.
-Priest!

633
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:15,167
-Was he here?
-Yes.

634
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,250
I think he left.

635
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:25,000
Wow. You bought so many things.

636
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:28,583
No. I have a job now.
I got it from the lady who hired me.

637
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:30,250
Food and Indian currency.

638
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:32,042
Now you don't have to work.

639
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,917
Stay home and take care of Bishal.

640
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,625
Why do I have to stay with Bishal?

641
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:36,750
Who else will?

642
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:38,250
I can't leave my job.

643
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:40,750
Why not? You don't even get paid.

644
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:43,333
All you get is milk. I can get that too.

645
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:45,042
But I got the job first.

646
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:49,042
But I am earning a lot more.
Moreover, I am the elder one.

647
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:51,875
-But I am taller.
-Don't talk like a fool.

648
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:54,500
I've promised the old man.

649
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:56,458
He is really old.

650
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:59,167
-Stop acting like an idiot.
-You are an idiot!

651
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,958
Stop acting like a baby.

652
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:02,000
You are a baby.

653
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:03,167
You are a cry baby.

654
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,083
I'm not crying, you are.

655
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:07,292
<i>-My brother is a cry baby!</i>
-You are.

656
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,917
<i>-You are a cry baby.</i>
-You are a cry baby, not me.

657
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,708
-You are a cry baby.
<i>-You are.</i>

658
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:14,833
<i>-You are a cry baby.</i>
-You are a cry baby, not me.

659
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:17,042
I won't stay with you.

660
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,125
<i>Cry baby...</i>

661
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,208
Pranay!

662
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:47,625
Pranay!

663
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:49,542
Pranay!

664
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:51,750
Pranay!

665
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,500
I know you are up there.

666
00:50:56,958 --> 00:50:58,583
I have a plan.

667
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:01,000
Both of us can work.

668
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,167
How?

669
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:03,583
Get down.

670
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,875
Look!

671
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:09,500
I can leave at eight and return by two.

672
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,500
Then, you can leave.

673
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:13,500
No, I need to leave early

674
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:16,250
to return before sunset.

675
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:20,333
-And I'm--
-I know, you are scared of the dark.

676
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:23,583
I'm hungry.

677
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:29,958
I've already taken food and money
from her.

678
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:32,167
I've already given him my word.

679
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,083
Bishal sleeps at that time.

680
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,250
So?

681
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,250
Listen.

682
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:49,375
If you put him to sleep before you leave,

683
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,333
I can be here before he wakes up.

684
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:52,917
What if he wakes up in between?

685
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:56,417
Once he sleeps, he is out for two hours.

686
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:58,500
Sounds good.

687
00:51:59,292 --> 00:52:01,375
You need this to keep track of time.

688
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:11,458
You should have this.

689
00:52:13,917 --> 00:52:15,792
Amrita.

690
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:19,208
-You are very intelligent.
-I know.

691
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:22,667
-Pranay.
-Yes?

692
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:24,792
I need to pee.

693
00:52:24,958 --> 00:52:26,125
Oh! Come on!

694
00:52:26,667 --> 00:52:29,875
I told you not to have water so late.

695
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:31,042
Now, hold it.

696
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:33,333
But, I have to!

697
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,750
-Good morning, Auntie.
-Good morning. Sit down.

698
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:47,333
You told me you go to school.

699
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:48,458
Yes.

700
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,625
So, you know how to read?

701
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,833
Yes.

702
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:54,250
Can you read the newspaper for me?

703
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:55,458
Newspaper?

704
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:57,458
Yes. From now on,

705
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:59,375
this is a part of your job.

706
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:01,917
Read the newspaper for an hour, everyday.

707
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,583
Read it.

708
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:55,167
-Amrita.
-Yes?

709
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:58,042
-Share it with your brother.
-Okay.

710
00:53:58,125 --> 00:53:59,417
-May I leave now?
-Okay.

711
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:01,583
-Amrita!
-Yes?

712
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:04,083
-Come early tomorrow.
-Okay.

713
00:54:28,542 --> 00:54:31,625
<i>Nature has allowed time to flow</i>

00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,875

00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:42,917
<i>A little bus became our home</i>

740
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,167
<i>Fear began to flee</i>

741
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:55,375
<i>Firewood instilled warmth within us</i>

742
00:57:56,833 --> 00:58:03,792
<i>Birds up in the sky say, "Hello neighbors"</i>

743
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:12,875
<i>In our small new world</i>

744
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:21,417
<i>In our small new world</i>

745
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:29,792
-I'm here, Sir.
-Hi! Come and join me.

746
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:33,708
What are you cooking?

747
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:36,333
Smells wonderful.

748
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:37,750
It will taste even better.

749
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,750
It was my son's favourite.

750
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:43,917
I don't cook it at home
because it upsets my wife.

751
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,708
That's why I prepare it near the outhouse.

752
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:48,917
Do you wonder where he would be?

753
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:51,292
Every single day.

754
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:53,125
But, I have no answer.

755
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
What?

756
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:02,542
My mother gave it to me.

757
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:05,958
She gave me a locket
and she gave a watch to Amrita.

758
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:09,125
Keeps us safe when she isn't around.

759
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:10,292
And Bishal?

760
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:11,625
What about Bishal?

761
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:13,708
What did she give Bishal?

762
00:59:13,792 --> 00:59:15,708
Bishal has us. His brother and sister!

763
00:59:17,167 --> 00:59:18,667
Okay. You can go.

764
00:59:19,292 --> 00:59:21,125
The food will be ready when you return.

765
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,583
You can take some home.

766
00:59:23,042 --> 00:59:23,917
Go.

767
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,833
When I fell near the waterfall,

768
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:37,708
my brother used a long bamboo log

769
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,542
to make a tap for me.

770
00:59:40,625 --> 00:59:44,208
The tap controls the force of water.

771
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:46,750
So I could wash the--

772
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,250
What happened?

773
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:54,917
I'm fine.

774
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:02,792
Auntie.

775
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,917
I can't get through.

776
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:49,417
Auntie!

777
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:52,583
Auntie.

778
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:03,292
Ma'am! Something is wrong
with Geeta Auntie.

779
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:04,958
She is in a lot of pain.

780
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:06,917
-Come fast.
-Okay.

781
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:11,292
Auntie.

782
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,792
Something is wrong.

783
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:16,000
I can't get in touch with him.

784
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:18,250
This pain is killing me.

785
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:35,167
You are about to deliver the baby.

786
01:01:36,708 --> 01:01:38,292
No, it's too soon.

787
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:40,958
Your baby doesn't think so.

788
01:01:41,417 --> 01:01:43,250
It is in a hurry.

789
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:45,542
Get some hot water in a bowl.

790
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:46,833
And, listen!

791
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,375
Get a couple of towels.

792
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:53,583
Cut a clean sheet into small pieces
and get that here.

793
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,458
Listen to me!

794
01:01:58,542 --> 01:02:00,875
I have done this before.

795
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:04,625
You are going to have the baby now.

796
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,375
Push harder. Harder!

797
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:30,000
A little harder.

798
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:34,667
Here.

799
01:02:36,292 --> 01:02:37,667
Towel?

800
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:38,958
Push!

801
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,708
Push!

802
01:02:47,917 --> 01:02:51,042
Push. Harder.

803
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:52,167
Towel.

804
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:55,292
Yes, you can do it.

805
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:58,458
Auntie, everything will be alright.

806
01:03:00,625 --> 01:03:02,875
Push! Push!

807
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:07,083
Harder!

808
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:22,000
Despite being a month early,
she is very healthy.

809
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:24,375
-Are you okay?
-What?

810
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:28,000
I will never have a baby.

811
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:36,958
You were good with the baby.
Why do you say so?

812
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:39,667
I have a little brother.

813
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,542
Bishal.

814
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:46,667
Child!

815
01:04:28,042 --> 01:04:29,292
Bishal!

816
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:07,708
Are you crazy? You could have died.

817
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:10,542
-My brother.
-The baby?

818
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,167
-My brother is in the bus.
-He was.

819
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:14,792
Where is he?

820
01:05:14,917 --> 01:05:17,333
We didn't know what to do.

821
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,708
So we gave him to the priest.

822
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,292
Priest?

823
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:25,125
Go to the church, you'll find him.

824
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:50,708
Pranay. Bishal!

825
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:57,333
Momma!

826
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:19,625
It's all my fault.

827
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:22,792
We will get him back.

828
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:24,083
How?

829
01:06:24,292 --> 01:06:26,167
What if the priest catches us?

830
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:29,042
I don't care.

831
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:32,167
I would prefer being eaten

832
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:34,875
than facing our mother without Bishal.

833
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,875
He is our baby brother.
We have to get him back.

834
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:15,083
Is this the church?

835
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,042
It's empty.

836
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:28,375
Bishal is not here.

837
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,583
You said the priest took him.

838
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,000
Where else could he be?

839
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:34,292
I don't know.

840
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:55,250
Let's go.

841
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:24,375
Bishal must be somewhere around.

842
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:25,750
But, where?

843
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:27,667
Let's check inside.

844
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:34,458
Hey!

845
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:36,833
What are you doing?

846
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:41,042
He is just a boy.

847
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:43,083
Maybe he has also been kidnapped.

848
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:48,750
Why are you hiding?

849
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:50,875
He is fat.

850
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:56,042
Maybe they fatten them up
before they eat them.

851
01:08:56,792 --> 01:08:58,000
Let's ask him.

852
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:03,417
Are there other children with you?

853
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,292
-What?
-Shush!

854
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:07,292
What?

855
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,458
Are there other children with you?

856
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:10,708
Yes.

857
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:12,500
Is there a small baby as well?

858
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:16,667
Where did he go?

859
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:18,958
Yes.

860
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:20,750
Did they bring him in, today?

861
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:22,375
Yes.

862
01:09:22,708 --> 01:09:24,625
It has to be Bishal.

863
01:09:24,917 --> 01:09:27,542
Is he wearing pink clothes?

864
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:28,708
Wait!

865
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:32,833
Yes.

866
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:34,208
It's him!

867
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:35,833
Let's get him.

868
01:09:38,042 --> 01:09:40,583
-Where are you going?
-Shush!

869
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:42,375
Where are you going?

870
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:45,542
We will rescue you as well.
Just be quiet.

871
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:47,708
But, where?

872
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,208
-Just keep quiet.
-Shush!

873
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,458
It's locked.

874
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,000
There must be a backdoor. Come on.

875
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:08,125
-Hey!
-Shush!

876
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:22,333
-Amrita?
-Yes.

877
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:24,667
It's very dark.

878
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:27,708
Stay right here. I'll get Bishal.

879
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:36,292
Shush!

880
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:41,250
Where is the baby?

881
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:42,917
They took him.

882
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:44,417
Where?

883
01:10:44,583 --> 01:10:46,083
Ask her.

884
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,375
Who are you?

885
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:50,667
What are you doing here?

886
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:53,875
Who are you? Where are you going?

887
01:10:56,167 --> 01:10:57,875
Amrita, run!

888
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:53,042
What are your names?

889
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,417
Where do you live? Where are you from?

890
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,875
Where are your parents?

891
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:08,042
Are you hungry?

892
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:09,667
Want to have some biscuits?

893
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:15,583
Here, have some biscuits.

894
01:12:21,208 --> 01:12:22,042
Listen to me.

895
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:23,583
You don't have to be scared.

896
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,667
No one will hurt you in here.

897
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:26,833
Yeah, right!

898
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:29,375
-Don't talk to him.
-Why?

899
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:31,125
You can talk to me.

900
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:35,708
Look!

901
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:37,333
If you don't talk to me,

902
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,000
I'll have to call the police.

903
01:12:39,292 --> 01:12:40,917
You'll have to speak to the police, then.

904
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,583
Yes! Call the police.

905
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:45,333
I will tell them what you do here.

906
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:46,458
Shush!

907
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:47,583
Don't shush me.

908
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:49,542
He will eat us, anyway.

909
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:50,583
What!

910
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:52,375
What will I do?

911
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:55,542
Give us our brother back
and we won't harm you!

912
01:12:56,708 --> 01:12:58,833
What are you talking about?

913
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,708
We know what you do
with children.

914
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:03,375
We have seen everything.

915
01:13:03,792 --> 01:13:05,292
Your accent?

916
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,125
Are you from Nepal?

917
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:09,792
He is lying. We haven't seen anything.

918
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:13,708
Just give us our brother back.
We won't say anything to anyone.

919
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,542
It's locked.

920
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,417
I told you not to talk to him.

921
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:41,625
Now he knows that we know everything.

922
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,208
He won't let us go.

923
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:48,083
He wouldn't have, anyway.

924
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:49,542
You shouldn't have come along!

925
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:53,042
I didn't want to. But I am here
to keep you from getting hurt.

926
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:00,375
Pranay.

927
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:03,292
You are the best brother in the world!

928
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,333
Not for Bishal though.

929
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:14,667
He is bringing more people.

930
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:18,208
What are you doing?

931
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,375
We either kill, or get killed.

932
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:38,000
Mom!

933
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,208
Mom.

934
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:40,667
Mom!

935
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:43,458
My children!

936
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,417
Mom, you found us!

937
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:52,792
Where were you?

938
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:56,125
-Where is Bishal?
-This man stole Bishal.

939
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,167
Now he will eat him.

940
01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,125
What?

941
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:02,625
It's true. He has taken Bishal.

942
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:05,667
He stole Bishal from our bus.

943
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:07,917
-Bus?
-Bus!

944
01:15:08,917 --> 01:15:10,083
Bus?

945
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,625
Mom, this place is very bad.

946
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:17,417
We have to get Bishal out of here.

947
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,583
What are you talking about?

948
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:21,000
They eat babies.

949
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:24,375
Yes. And they make us forget our religion.

950
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,042
Who told you all this nonsense?

951
01:15:27,167 --> 01:15:28,417
-Uncle Rai.
-Uncle Rai.

952
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,667
That old man?

953
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:31,167
Is that why you ran away?

954
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:34,833
Bishal!

955
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:35,958
Baby.

956
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:38,458
My baby.

957
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:47,625
What are you doing?

958
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,417
He may have eaten some parts.

959
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,917
Pranay, they don't eat babies.

960
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:54,750
They have been helping me find you.

961
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:55,917
You know what?

962
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:57,667
Uncle Rai is here as well.

963
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:00,417
Has he forgotten his Gods?

964
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,375
No, he hasn't.

965
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:04,667
They are very good people.

966
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:08,417
I don't eat children.

967
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:09,667
I promise.

968
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:16,375
-Mom, you have to meet Baje.
-Baje?

969
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:20,458
An old man. I took his goats out to graze.

970
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:24,250
Harke, Birkhe, Suntali, Furba.

971
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:27,542
And he used to pay me with milk.

972
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,125
You worked?

973
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,917
Yes, and I used to work
at Geeta Auntie's place.

974
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:36,208
For food and Indian currency.

975
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,458
Mom.

976
01:16:37,708 --> 01:16:38,583
Mom?

977
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:40,042
What happened?

978
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:42,250
What if I hadn't found you?

979
01:16:42,542 --> 01:16:45,333
But, you did find us!

980
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:47,625
That's true. Come here.

981
01:16:50,542 --> 01:16:51,833
Come with me.

982
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:53,125
Where?

983
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:55,417
You will see. Come on.

984
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:57,250
Mom.

985
01:16:57,917 --> 01:17:00,167
I never want to have babies.

986
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:01,667
Never?

987
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:02,917
Why?

988
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:05,167
It's a lot of hard-work.

989
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,375
Really?

990
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:07,542
There.

991
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:11,917
Dad!

992
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:19,792
Mom.

993
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:22,333
-Dad?
-Yes, your father!

994
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:28,333
I thought he was dead.

995
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:29,667
Rubbish!

996
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,208
He is okay.

997
01:17:31,542 --> 01:17:33,000
Everything is okay.

998
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:34,208
Go.

999
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:36,167
Go.

1000
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:37,500
Go!

1001
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,875
Pranay, come here.

1002
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:46,250
Come here!

1003
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:05,375
It's true!

1004
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,875
They are our children! Come fast!

1005
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:10,083
Where were you?

1006
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:12,875
We were so worried.

1007
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:14,708
Little brats!

1008
01:18:14,792 --> 01:18:16,167
Uncle.

1009
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,875
Uncle, priests don't eat babies.

1010
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:22,625
You lied.

1011
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:24,833
Hold your ears.

1012
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:28,583
Do your sit-ups.

1013
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:30,417
One.

1014
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:32,042
Two.

1015
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:33,708
Three.

1016
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:35,625
Four.

1017
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:37,417
Five.

1018
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:39,500
Six.
