See here,is this meekness?

179
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,640
Please...

180
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,000
Come,sir,
Is it your's?...

181
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,400
Yes, what's the problem?
-This is the problem.

182
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,560
His pet dog got our dog
into the lift and played.

183
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,160
Oh, it's the dogs play.

184
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,560
You are great,

185
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,000
I too love an aunty,
but I couldn't do anything.

186
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,000
Let  both of us take a selfie.

187
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,720
Look here,steady.

188
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,640
What? You're taking
selfie with a dog?

189
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
It's like your son-in-law, boss

190
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,720
Are you Salman khan?
-Am I a deer?

191
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,640
To do hunting?

192
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,480
"To open up my mind."

193
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,840
"OTP is with you"

194
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,440
"Tell me so crazy"

195
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,200
"Bye..father."

196
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,720
"You're the micro SIM for Apple"

197
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,640
"If said once,
it's ok,dear."

198
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,800
"If I'm the Aadhar Card."

199
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,440
"You're the credit card."

200
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,160
"Uncle, are you a cheat?"

201
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,680
I'm Aavudaiyappan,
Private detective.

202
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,760
I'm Siva, staying in 404.

203
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,200
Father?
-Hi!

204
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,360
We own a heritage shop
near Velachery.

205
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,360
Visit once,
if you can.

206
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,680
Oh,Antique shop!
I like antique pieces very much.

207
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,160
See you.

208
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,000
Boss,he belongs to
your category.

209
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,520
Mine?
How?

210
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,680
He has a shop for aunties.

211
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,400
It's not a shop for aunties.

212
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,840
That's the place of selling
old and ancient things.

213
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,760
Both are the same, isn't it?

214
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,640
Good morning,sir.
Commissioner is waiting for you.

215
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,200
Hello,Aavudaiyappan.

216
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,920
Come,take your seat.

217
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,680
Thank you,sir.

218
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,840
Sorry, Mr.Aavudaiyappan.

219
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,120
I called you not for this case.

220
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,160
The matter is...
-Sir, see the printout.

221
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,520
Sir.
-It's for a personal matter.

222
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,800
Sir,minister is on phone.

223
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,280
Sir,minister...
-Torture.

224
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,440
By the way,
she is deputy commissioner,

225
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,600
Ms.Shreya Chandran.

226
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,400
Bold and sincere officer.

227
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,440
He will stare at old ladies,

228
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,400
She stands cool.

229
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,440
Boss, don't put me behind bars.

230
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,760
Hello...

231
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,360
Boss, knock out.

232
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,320
Nice to meet you.

233
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,520
By the by,a child abuse case
has happened in Coimbatore.

234
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,840
That accused was shot at
his genitals, isn't it?

235
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,560
She shot him.

236
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,440
There.

237
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,640
No boss.

238
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,880
I want to talk with
you personally,come.

239
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,920
You must do
me an urgent help.

240
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,720
Tell me.

241
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,840
In Purasawakkam,
the owner of AMT hotel,

242
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,520
Mr.Thanikachalam...

243
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,560
The Jewels of AMT Jewellery,
will bring smile to your home.

244
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,360
Don't know what happened to him?

245
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,960
Missing for past three days.

246
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,360
Missing for three days?

247
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,400
His son Mahalingam
is calling me frequently.

248
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,280
If I take up this case, the
information might leak out.

249
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,400
That's why I'm appointing
a private detective.

250
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,400
Earlier,you closed "Dharamchand case"
without going to press.

251
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,840
Similar way,if you close
this case also...

252
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,200
.... it'll be more helpful.

253
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,840
Again?

254
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,000
Sir,photos from Pune murder spot.

255
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
-"Rudraksham!"
-Yes.

256
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,760
32 faces rudraksham is a rare piece!

257
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,200
In general, murderers are of
only two types.

258
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,080
Either they'll do the job
without any evidence.

259
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,520
Or,to confuse the police
they'll leave some wrong evidence.

260
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,480
Sir,we'll handle this case.

261
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,520
You leave it.

262
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,760
Sorry, Mr.Aavudaiyappan.

263
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,680
She'll handle that case.

264
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
You better trace out
the AMT hotel case.

265
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,160
At least at 80 schools so far,

266
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm creating awareness
about child abusement...

267
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,360
As we don't teach them,
they're facing many dangers.

268
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,480
It's important to talk to
children about child abusement.

269
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,760
Actually,I'm doing this
as a profession.

270
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,800
For school children,
especially five to ten years aged.

271
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,800
It's must be taught
in the school syllabus.

272
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,440
Dear children,
I'm going to teach you...

273
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,280
...about Good touch and bad touch.

274
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,760
Good touch means,
Hug by parents,

275
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,120
Our teacher pats us
as a gesture of appreciation.

276
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,520
Shaking hands with friends.

277
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,640
These are termed as
good touch.

278
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Bad touch means,

279
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,880
Strange persons kissing us.

280
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,800
Sue not to tell anyone
and asking you to sit on lap.

281
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,760
Trying to touch
the privy parts.

282
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,920
These are termed as bad touch.

283
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,640
I'm telling you this because,

284
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,000
Today our society
is mingled with bad persons.

285
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,520
Why do they touch us?

286
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,880
We can't understand the motive
of their touch at this tender age.

287
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,960
If we are aware of
these touches,

288
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,160
We can protect ourselves
from child abuse.

289
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,680
Thank you, sir.

290
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,250
That statue is nice

291
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,686
It is a marvellous painting

292
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,600
It is expensive

293
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:33,468
Uncle good morning

294
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,151
Uncle at home, here I am your boss

295
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,680
I started after you..

296
00:19:37,696 --> 00:19:39,531
Reached office before you reach

297
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,487
Go to beauty parlour and colour the car

298
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:43,221
Otherwise I don't care

299
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:44,975
Uncle, some customers are coming

300
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Ha.. unbelievable

301
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,126

Manit Singh family has come from Punjab

304
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:55,314
The phot you kept outside...

305
00:19:55,348 --> 00:19:57,548
They are impressed with the Sardarji photo

306
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,120
What, Sardarji..

307
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,050
Oh.. only with the turban,
Bharathi has become Sardarji?

308
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,096
Don't break the steps

309
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,027

00:20:25,894 --> 00:20:28,542
-Thisis my secretary Dora.
-Awesome.

314

-This is small box
-No, this is Big Boss

315
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,437

00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,403
hey, hey Owner brother, don't confuse
our family by your lengthy talk

317
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,554

318
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,344
We want a bronze statue

319
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,196

Not Poori, Bronze statue

322
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
-What?
-What the hell? Are you mad?

323
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,293
He is asking for the bronze statue.

324
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,619
Mayil Singh!

325
00:20:57,653 --> 00:20:58,952
-Mayil Singh?
-What's this?

326
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:01,643
I asked for a different statue,
why are you getting this one?

327
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,476
-In what language is he swearing?
-I don't understand.

328
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:05,497
-I need a bronze statue.
-A bronze statue!

329
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,274
-Bronze statue, I say!
-Yes, the bronze statue.

330
00:21:07,298 --> 00:21:09,298
Come on.

331
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,640
-Mayil Singh!
-Not even this one?

332
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,620
Be quick!

333
00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:19,596

334
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,342
A manequin!

335
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,295
Is this the one, Mayil Singh?

336
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,917
Damn you!

337
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:32,324
This guy is troubling us!

338
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,923
Get another one.

339
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,031
Damn!

340
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:40,158
What is he trying to convey by pointing at that fat lady?

341
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:43,185
If you don't find what he is asking for

342
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,563
-he'll force you to marry that lady.
-No way.

343
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,760
I'll kill you!

344
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,899
Look! There!

345
00:21:53,955 --> 00:21:56,733
-That's the one.
-You tortured us for this statue?

346
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:59,813
I'll arrange it. Hey. Parcel the statue.

347
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:03,907
Hey! The punjabi guy has troubled us.

348
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,032
Thanks for giving us the statue
that we were looking for.

349
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:11,077
You wanted to buy a woman's statue.

350
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,880
And you kept saying bronze statue.

351
00:22:13,914 --> 00:22:16,748
My husband can't pronounce it correctly.

352
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:18,989
Get lost before I curse you.

353
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:21,569
-I want the monkey statue.
-I want the monkey statue.

354
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:24,413
Get lost. Finally, they are
amaking monkeys out of us.

355
00:22:24,447 --> 00:22:25,436
What happened uncle?

356
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,250
-Have you just arrived?
- Yes...

357
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,118
A punjabi family came and
made morons out of us.

358
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:34,325
Who kept the monkey's
statue here?

359
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:38,231
You move out of the mirror
and the monkey will be gone.

360
00:22:45,527 --> 00:22:48,360
AMT's golden jewelry is the pride of your family.

361
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,520
Blackie, you must finish all
the works before my arrival.

362
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,440
I will do.

363
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,960
You must do half of the
works of my husband's.

364
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,960
Yes,I'll do.

365
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,320
I'm your half husband.

366
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,640
-Hey.
-Boss.

367
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,760
You talk in a disaster way.

368
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,160
I'm worried of lack of time.

369
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,960
Are you the half husband?

370
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,840
I don't know that,boss.

371
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,480
Get the car ready.

372
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,640
Uncle,I'm also ready.

373
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,200
It's my pleasure.

374
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,800
Come, let's go.

375
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,360
Why?

376
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,320
If a youngster accompanies me,

377
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,280
I'll get ideas as spark.

378
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,720
Yes,Instead of that skin head,

379
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,200
It'll be useful in
investigation if I go.

380
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,680
Come...

381
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,600
No,you get inside.

382
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,320
Tomorrow is your final exam.

383
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:24,344
I know what he is going to investigate

384
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,240
Boss,what a big house!

385
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,240
On the day he went missing,

386
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,560
He drove the car
at early morning 4,

387
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,040
His car was stranded
at Ambattur bridge.

388
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,840
We don't know where he left,
What happened to him?

389
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,240
She is my Aunt.

390
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,840
Hello,sir.

391
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:46,960
Hello.

392
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,800
He was an ardent devotee.

393
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,230
Goes for holywalk every month.

394
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,160
Dad donates idols to all temples.

395
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,080
My grandfather is too good.

396
00:24:04,204 --> 00:24:06,104
Daily goes to Kapaleeswarar temple

397
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:08,128
Boss

398
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:10,152
The day AMT went on missing

399
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:12,176
He used this car

400
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
There is a temple inside

401
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:16,224
Only the priest is missing

402
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,248
Keep everything safely

403
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:20,272
Let the investigation gets oveer

404
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,760
Hey Krishna,dad's attire
is drying up.Take that.

405
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,320
No, i won't touch mine.
You take on your own.

406
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,640
When think of you,
my mind bounces.

407
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,480
When try to write,
I can't get the words.

408
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,650
Poem, everywhere poem..

409
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:59,174
You saw me once, a thorn pinned me

410
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:02,198
Shouldn't a thorn be removed by a thorn?

411
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:04,722
Come on look at me once aagain

412
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,200
Idea!

413
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,920
No one can steady me.

414
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,720
What are you doing?
Don't be afraid.

415
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,600
Hey, can't you be quiet?

416
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,920
Sorry,he has thrown that.

417
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,800
I'll come.

418
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,880
Hey,why did you
throw on her?

419
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,404
Hey Siva..

420
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Whatever problem you dont care

421
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
But underwear problem you take care

422
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,976
What to do?

423
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,960
Does he wear so large?

424
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,000
Shouldn't be right on.

425
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,480
Idiot.

426
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,480
What an arrogance!

427
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,170
She gifts Aavudaiyappan's attires.

428
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,520
God,give me what I want.

429
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,720
Hey,I don't wear this.

430
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,800
Dear,why are you crying?

431
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,160
What happened?

432
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,680
Who hit you,tell me?

433
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,080
I denied choco bar.

434
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,160
Tuition master hit me.

435
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,080
He hit you for
not taking choco bar!

436
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,440
Tell me,what happened?

437
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,760
My mother works as
a maid in that apartment.

438
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,840
I'll study there till
my mother comes back.

439
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,000
Then, master....

440
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,680
You could've told your mom.

441
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,680
He threatened, if I tell mom...

442
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,080
...he'll kill by driving car
on her, when she sweeps.

443
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,160
Don't be afraid.

444
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,760
Listen,you must understand clearly.

445
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,840
You must not allow anyone to touch lips,
neck,chest and genitals.

446
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,400
Then,our relatives, dad's friends,
tuition master...

447
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,760
... whoever touch you odd,
tell your elders without panic.

448
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,160
Understood?

449
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,600
Don't be Afraid.

450
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,080
Sir.

451
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,800
You left denying choco bar.

452
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,840
Sorry sir.

453
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,680
Master has bought
a gift for you.

454
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,520
Hey,who are you?

455
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,800
Sir, I'm very decent.

456
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,120
I belong to educated family.

457
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,240
Inquire in neighborhood,sir.

458
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,080
I'm 40 years old,
still a bachelor.

459
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,320
Sir...

460
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,560
No,sir.

461
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,480
It's painful,sir.

462
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,640
It's painful.

463
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,000
No, sir.

464
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,520
Choco bar...

465
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,520
Eat now.

466
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,000
See,this is an important place.

467
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,880
You must watch
everything keenly.

468
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,440
Yes,boss.

469
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,640
Don't be a jester.

470
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,160
Hello,sir.

471
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,000
Hello.

472
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,360
This is my dad's main office.

473
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,920
Oh, then you are incharge
of jewellery shop.

474
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,560
Yes,sir.

475
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,360
Excuse me,sir.

476
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,360
Crazy!

477
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,600
Boss,why are we here?

478
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,040
For investigation,boss.

479
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,920
I'm in that work,only.

480
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,000
By assisting him,

481
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,440
I thought of becoming,James bond.

482
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,080
It seems,I can't even
be a thief.

483
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,200
Hello,sir.
Nice to meet you.

484
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,640
Sir asked you to meet
in MD room.

485
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,320
Hello,

486
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,320
Shall I say a poetry?

487
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,000
I'll say,come.

488
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,920
Boeuf.

489
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,680
He loom up the power.

490
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,320
But I got the shock.

491
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,960
What a bizarre world?

492
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,720
Hell.

493
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Shirdi Baba prasadam.

494
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,600
Statue from Vietnam.

495
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,480
Kuberar Temple.

496
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,040
Meenakshi amman Chain

497
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,280
Scented roots from Chidambaram.

498
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,040
Rudraksham with 32 faces.

499
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,680
Vinayak statue from Mumbai.

500
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,440
-Manimudi.
-Boss!

501
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,040
We have seen devotees.

502
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,760
Even ardent devotees.

503
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,080
But,Spate of devotion
flows on here.

504
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:58,104
First time seeing here, boss

505
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,600
On the whole, not a day
would've passed...

506
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,880
...without pooja in his house.

507
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,520
Yes, boss.

508
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,600
Did you call me,sir?

509
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,720
He is Ramanujam.

510
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,800
He works with dad
for past 38 years.

511
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,040
For 38 years!

512
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,600
He is the only person
to be informed dad's missing.

513
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,000
I see.

514
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,040
He is panic-stricken about dad.

515
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,360
How do you feel that something
might happened to him?

516
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,000
It's been 38 years,sir.

517
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,440

518
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,160
Mr.Ramanujam.

519
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,720
Sir,

520
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,400
Could you please give me
your phone number?

521
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,960
My number! Why?

522
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,400
You are a close aide to him like a shadow.

523
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,720
If I need any information,
I can ask you.

524
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,760
Hey,I can't remember
Ramanujam's phone number.

525
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,280
You said as noted.
-Just for fun.

526
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,560
You ask him again,
as you forgot...

527
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,600
Boss,I already saved the number.

528
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,960
Good.

529
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,320
Thank you.

530
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,560
You send this number to Jolitha.

531
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,640
Ask her to take the
list of call history.

532
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,360
Then,tell her to get me a duplicate
SIM card of the same number.

533
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,280
Okay,boss.

534
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,360
No...

535
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,760
No...

536
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,440
Leave me.

537
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,320
Parvati...

538
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,920
I'll get later.

539
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,840
Parvati,stop.

540
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,360
I won't leave you.

541
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,440
Instead of going to
native for festival,

542
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,240
Many feel happy when
their wives are out of station.

543
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,840
Do you know, which is the
biggest jail in the world?

544
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,440
Tihar jail.

545
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,920
Being with wife for long haul.

546
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,640
Okay.

547
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
It's my responsibility
to get you divorce.

548
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,280
You must be in terms of someone.

549
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,400
Sir,Nambi from Thirumbalam has come.

550
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,640
Nambi!

551
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,480
He is adamant to meet you,sir.

552
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,000
He says, he knows you well.

553
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,720
Hey,how did he come here?

554
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,720
Send him out, first.

555
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,960
Go...

556
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,520
Take this money,

557
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,360
Send him away.

558
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,160
Go...

559
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,800
Somehow, he came in
search of me.

560
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,200
Take this.
He won't meet you.

561
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,720
Leave...

562
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,040
Won't he meet me?

563
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,600
I must meet him.

564
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,400
Move.

565
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,360
He won't.
Can't you listen me?

566
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,640
If the axe rise up,
The banyan tree must fall.

567
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,960
Mr.Shiva,you better come to
Ismail's house,in Kasimedu.

568
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,880
We'll meet there at evening.

569
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,320
Tell me,Jolitha.

570
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,480
I got all the details
of that phone number.

571
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,480
AMT Ramanujam's phone bill
was above 10K, every month.

572
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,360
I see.

573
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,080
Then, Ismail has been
contacted frequently from that number.

574
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,480
Okay.

575
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,760
We'll discuss later in home.

576
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,680
I'll wait,uncle.

577
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,600
Boss, why do you have
doubt on AMT Ramanujam?

578
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,680
If a person gets panic,

579
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,760
Either he would've done
some mistake...

580
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,800
...or he must hide other's mistake.

581
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,920
To my knowledge,he is
caught up with a blue whale.

582
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,920
Someone must be playing with him.

583
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,680
Blacky, we must vacate
this apartment.

584
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,360
Even the owner
asked us to vacate.

585
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,320
Why?

586
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,160
Uncle doesn't spare any aunty.

587
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,800
I'm not bothered about that.

588
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,160
Good family!

589
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,720
The tuition master in upper floor
is admitted in hospital...

590
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,200
... because of shock in privy.

591
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,800
I have a doubt,uncle.

592
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,520
Is it an accident?

593
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
It looks like an accident.

594
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,720
But, actually it's a threatening.

595
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,720
Why?

596
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,160
We are involved in AMT case.

597
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,040
Someone doesn't like that.

598
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,680
But, how do they know
that we took up this case?

599
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,680
We are not clear still
who they might be?

600
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,600
They are very clear
on our whereabouts.

601
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,680
That's why they are
watching us keenly.

602
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,040
Uncle, who is the most suspicious
person in this case?

603
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,400
The close aide of AMT,
Ramanujam.

604
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,280
Ismail,whom you got in phone list.

605
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,680
There is possibility for
either of them to kidnap AMT.

606
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,800
If we follow kasimedu Ismail

607
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,800
We might get an idea.

608
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,800
Boss,where are we at this time?

609
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,360
To Ismail's house.

610
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,520
You mean this light house?

611
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,880
This is night house...

612
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,040
Hey, hold this.

613
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,800
Boss,why have you changed
that?

614
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,680
It's a special glass.

615
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,520
What's special?

616
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:35,920
A camera is inside, to catch
all the moments happening around.

617
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,680
Top notch! boss.

618
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,840
I'm very proud
to be your assistant.

619
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,240
I feel like sticking to noose
to be your boss.

620
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,080
Let it be,boss.

621
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,760
This place is apt.

622
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,600
Boss,sister!

623
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,080
Hey,

624
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,440
Sorry,boss.

625
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,400
Lustful.

626
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,000
Are you new?

627
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,440
Yes.
Very much.

628
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,480
It's visible.

629
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,480
Shall I call the sweets?

630
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,400
Call them...

631
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,040
Why does he wander?

632
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,840
Girls...

633
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,360
Rajasthan!
-Hi

634
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,080
Hi.

635
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,560
She is from khajakasthan.

636
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,840
Good.

637
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,760
Kingsthan.

638
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,280
Sthan...

639
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,480
Is anyone from Amazon?

640
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,760
You are there.

641
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,720
Boss,shall I select from each place?

642
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,080
Boss is not satisfied it seems.

643
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
A special one!

644
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,720
What is that?

645
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,080
Sir,

646
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,600
Shall we go to Durbar hall?

647
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,280
Girls...

648
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,080
"Didn't you see in the attire of,
skirt and half-saree?"

649
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,400
"Don't you've a desire to
watch the dance show?"

650
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,360
"Didn't you see in the attire of,
skirt and half-saree?"

651
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,720
"Don't you've a desire to
watch the dance show?"

652
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,840
"Isn't this a day, where the
silver moon comes bouncing?"

653
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,880
"Isn't it the time,where queen
comes in palanquin?"

654
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,360
"Isn't it a disguise,if you deny here?"

655
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,080
"Isn't it a flaw?"

656
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,440
Unique!

657
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,440
"Didn't you see in the attire of,
skirt and half-saree?"

658
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,840
"Don't you've a desire to
watch the dance show?"

659
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,600
"It's distinct when tress is
adorned with jasmine."

660
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,480
"It's distinct for jasmine,
when my beau assigns it,"

661
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,680
"It's distinct for legs,
wearing anklets,"

662
00:40:03,532 --> 00:40:07,706
"It's distinct for legs,
wearing anklets,"

663
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,920
"It's distinct to the concert,
if heard on bed,"

664
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,098
"It's distinct to the concert"

665
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,960
Unique!

666
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,160
"Didn't you see in the attire of,
skirt and half-saree?"

667
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,600
"Don't you've a desire to
watch the dance show?"

668
00:40:49,634 --> 00:40:53,018
"It's distinct to face
wearing nose pin,"

669
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:57,692
"It's distinct for nose pin,
when it nap on beau's chest."

670
00:40:57,726 --> 00:41:01,726
"It's distinct for life,
if adorned with bindi on forehead."

671
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,068
"It's distinct if it
goes weary by kisses,"

672
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:08,408
"It's distinct on the whole."

673
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:11,271
Is unique, okay?

674
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,945
Double okay.

675
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:14,589
I must meet Bhai.

676
00:41:14,626 --> 00:41:15,626
Boy?

677
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,797
Ismail Bhai.

678
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,400
Baby boys,
Follow me.

679
00:41:21,794 --> 00:41:22,754
You get in.

680
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,560
I won't come.

681
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,360
If I come, he'll not leave me.

682
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,428
How do you know about Ismail?

683
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,491
Ramanujam told me.

684
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:34,565
Are you both friends?

685
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,811
It's five lakhs for two.

686
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,440
Okay?

687
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,654
Hey,come in.

688
00:41:47,289 --> 00:41:50,889
Native chicks,enjoy.

689
00:41:51,816 --> 00:41:53,016
Come...

690
00:41:56,032 --> 00:41:57,112
Come here.

691
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,680
She is 13 years old.

692
00:42:06,928 --> 00:42:07,688
Go.

693
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:09,849
Boss,what happened to you?

694
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,120
Just for fun.

695
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,280
Will he find anything
related to this case?

696
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,120
It's the 117th place, where
I'm talking about child abuse.

697
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,200
Sexual offense against children
is increasing in India.

698
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,120
Even the wild animals
don't indulge in abuse.

699
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
But humans do.

700
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,360
What's the reason for
increasing rate of these crimes?

701
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
The culprits can escape easily.

702
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,360
There is no proper
punishment for the culprits.

703
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,960
We met some
sexual offenders in prison.

704
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,760
We inquired them,
why do they indulge in cruel act?

705
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,680
We are terrified
at their reason.

706
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,960
Children who feel a distance
from parents are our target.

707
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,840
If we talk to them kindly,
they'll come on their own.

708
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,800
Feared of identity,
we'll kill them.

709
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,680
Always parents are busy in phone.
So targeting is easy.

710
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,520
Haven't you spoiled the
life of both, you and the victim?

711
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,760
Why does my life gets spoilt?

712
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,760
I'm enjoying the basic
needs here.

713
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,320
After a few years,
I might be released on...

714
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,400
...birth centenary of leaders

715
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,640
If we touch adults,
it's a problem.

716
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,480
But not a problem
with children.

717
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,480
They may get panic,
but won't tell in home.

718
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,640
A child's life and dignity
is so casual for them.

719
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,720
Who is the reason behind this?

720
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,720
The culprits who
target lonely children,

721
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,560
The parents who leave
the children alone.

722
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,160
So,the children must
always be in entice of parents.

723
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,240
Parents must not let
the children to be with strangers.

724
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,400
Hey, who are you?

725
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,560
Who gave you permission?

726
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,520
Who let you inside?

727
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,280
Go away.

728
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,640
You are coming in
with this vehicle?

729
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,160
Don't know where is AMT?

730
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,520
Someone is teasing.

731
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,320
Hey,come on.
Go...

732
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,200
What's the problem?

733
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,320
You stay here.
-Okay.

734
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,160
Go away.
Leave.

735
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,040
I'll look after that,
you go.

736
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,560
Why did you come here, Nambi?

737
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,280
The job is over,still what?
Go away.

738
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,920
I need 5 lakhs.

739
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,960
I too need.
But,who gives us?

740
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,400
What I gave earlier,
isn't that enough?

741
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,840
That's for the job done.

742
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,160
Now,it's for the job
I'm going to do.

743
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,040
Don't be louder.
Wait...wait.

744
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,400
Take this.
Go...Go...

745
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,360
Go...Go...

746
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,720
A good source of money!

747
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,360
"The bad company is bound
to harm you".

748
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,480
Damn!

749
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,630
-Just tell me what the matter is.
-Like you said,

750
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:59,612
Ramanujam and the kidnapping
has some connection. You were right.

751
00:44:59,637 --> 00:45:03,230
-What's surprising about it?
-He was speaking to a rowdy.

752
00:45:03,255 --> 00:45:07,119
He gave him some money and while going
the rowdy spoke about somebody's shop

753
00:45:07,144 --> 00:45:09,156
and said that it's a flourishing business.

754
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:11,310
-I see.
-Shall I follow him?

755
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:12,960
No, don't mess it up.

756
00:45:12,985 --> 00:45:16,486
The job I assigned you with
was to follow Ramanujam.

757
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:19,747
-Just stick to that. Okay?
-Damn it!

758
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,440
He is hell bent on killing off
my brainy ideas!

759
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,320
Kerala- Athirapally
stone quarry.

760
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,640
"Immersing the mortal in water"

761
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,600
Don't Leave me.

762
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,560
Hi Smiley.

763
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Are you in anger?

764
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,040
I'm waiting.

765
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,720
What's this?

766
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,640
"You hit the wall with nail"

767
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,480
"How come you
gong on my head?"

768
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,880
Hey, skin head.
-Madam.

769
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,160
Will you both
make a good pair?

770
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,960
Boss is waiting,come on.

771
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,520
"Your parents are from Africa
So America didn't accept"

772
00:48:48,618 --> 00:48:49,458
Yes.

773
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,934
-Ma'am the minister's brother?
-About that murders?

774
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,360
-The rumors on social media?
-Investigations are going on.

775
00:48:54,372 --> 00:48:55,627
Please cooperate.

776
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,080
I can't reveal it to the media.

777
00:48:58,113 --> 00:49:00,588
The press is relentless!

778
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,985
Sir, I found these traditional beads
from the murder spot.

779
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,600
The same type of traditional beads!

780
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,680
Are they leaving this unintentionally,
or intentionally, for us to know?

781
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,228
Sir, yesterday
in lawyer Shenbagamurthy's office

782
00:49:14,253 --> 00:49:18,171
a guy named Nambi was creating ruckus.
Here's the CCTV footage.

783
00:49:26,894 --> 00:49:29,371
Collect all the CCTV
footage from this area.

784
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,600
I want a report in two hours on who
the guy is and his whereabouts.

785
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,040
Dear, a gift coupon for 12K
is sent from Chennai silks.

786
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,960
What do you say?

787
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,120
Hey, hurry up.

788
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,680
Chennai silks manager is here.

789
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,800
You talk with him. We'll be back.

790
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,440
What do you say?
Who has come?

791
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,360
I can't understand anything.
Where?

792
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,600
Hi,RJ.

793
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,560
I got your video footage.

794
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,080
So,the AMT case
which I hand over you...

795
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,920
...and the Anwar basha serial murder case,
both are the same,right?

796
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,960
Yes,sir.
I'm damn sure.

797
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,000
How did you
grab this,Aavudaiyappan?

798
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,920
I had a doubt on Ramunajam,
right from the beginning.

799
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,400
So,I inquired him in
the technique of police.

800
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,320
Is the treatment started?

801
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,480
Huge money, property documents
are in his name.

802
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,920
He is not simply a benami
but a huge tsunami.

803
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,400
What's the link between Ramanujam
and the psycho slayed victims?

804
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,080
Do you know,
who are they?

805
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,360
I never seen them.

806
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,400
Really, don't know?
-No,I don't know.

807
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:06,280
Is he your own brother?
Or cloning?

808
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,600
He said that
they are not related to him.

809
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,240
But for lawyer
Shenbagamurthy's demise...

810
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,360
...he went to his house.

811
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,800
There I got the clue.

812
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,920
Ismail,who do service
to your boss...

813
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,800
...Is caught by the police.

814
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,240
So, he told everything.

815
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,120
I'll tell the truth.

816
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,600
Either you must be
affected by them...

817
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,320
...or might be fond for money.

818
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,080
That's why you kidnapped
and killed each and every one.

819
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,080
So, now tell me where
you kept AMT Thanikachalam.

820
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:52,480
Hey no...

821
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,960
Why do you say unfair?

822
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,640
Why must I slay my boss?

823
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,840
It's said that our name is
written on the rice bead we eat.

824
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,520
Is he good or bad?

825
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,600
Our food has the
name of my boss,AMT.

826
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,720
How it's possible to write
the name in every rice bead?

827
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,840
Go sir.

828
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,840
Uncle, I got Vietnam flight tickets
and four passports from his room.

829
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,120
Vietnam visa seals in all.

830
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,960
AM Thanikachalam.

831
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,280
Anwar basha.

832
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,320
Shenbhagamurthy.

833
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,080
Daniel.

834
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,800
Who is this Daniel?

835
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,600
Where he is?

836
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,040
Mr.Ramanujam,
your loyalty is appreciable.

837
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,000
But loyalty to faulty
not only affects you...

838
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,240
...but your family also.

839
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,560
You...as you said, our boss AMT,

840
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,720
Business man, Anwar basha,

841
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,680
Lawyer Shanbhagamurthy and

842
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,480
Daniel are long time friends.

843
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,920
Our boss has a
requisition in Vietnam.

844
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,280
Rudramurthy statue.

845
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,920
He has a weakness.

846
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,000
What's that?

847
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,720
Why did they go to
Vietnam, often...?

848
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:48,000
By the statement of Ramanujam,
AMT has a weakness.

849
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,800
I think all these serial killings
happened around this.

850
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,320
Finally,only one person is left.
He is real estate magnet,Daniel.

851
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,800
Got information that
he is in abroad, now.

852
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,000
No...

853
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,360
Regarding the rape and murder of
an 8 year old in Jammu and Kashmir

854
00:54:42,385 --> 00:54:45,864
Kamal Haasan representing his
political party has condoned it.

855
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,575
In his tweet on the cruelty,

856
00:54:48,628 --> 00:54:52,282
and as a father and a citizen

857
00:54:52,338 --> 00:54:54,362
he is has expressed anger
regarding the incident.

858
00:54:54,386 --> 00:54:57,806
A few people abducted the
child who was busy playing.

859
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,583
They raped her for 8 days in a temple.

860
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:03,591
They took the half dead child
to the jungle.

861
00:55:03,615 --> 00:55:06,368
They choked her throat and killed her.
And at that time

862
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,200
God didn't provide justice.

863
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,504
You have been discussing
this in every school.

864
00:55:13,552 --> 00:55:16,272
We should do something beyond
mere discussions, Shiva...

865
00:55:28,233 --> 00:55:30,233
Have you seen this girl?

866
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,629
-Stop the car.
-I remember seeing him somewhere.

867
00:55:34,193 --> 00:55:35,327
Satish!

868
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,823
He's the one we saw in the CCTV footage.
Catch him!

869
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,872
Stop!

870
00:55:45,103 --> 00:55:47,483
Stop, you!

871
00:55:47,537 --> 00:55:49,537
No!

872
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,974
Watch it! Damn it.

873
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,560
All the Tamil letters
are different.

874
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,280
This is used now,
only by sculptors.

875
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,640
Jolitha.
-Uncle.

876
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,200
Give it to Prof.Ramachandran...

877
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,760
...and ask him about the sculptor
who writes this now.

878
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,840
Do you know AMT?

879
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,440
Often,he comes to meet sir.

880
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,040
If in need,come for inquiry.

881
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:24,920
Okay?
-Okay,sir.

882
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,240
Tell me about Anwar basha.

883
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,520
The culprit must be
an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva.

884
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,720
Because,the first murder
was named as "slaying in air"

885
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,200
Next is,"immerse of mortal in water"

886
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,800
He calls the incidents
in the order of "Five elements".

887
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,280
Also a Shiva abode is nearby
in all the murder spots.

888
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,120
Especially,that abodes are meant
as "victory of good over evil".

889
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,440
He followed everyone
for years together...

890
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,880
...and kidnapped them cleverly.

891
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:25,360
A clear and brilliant planning.

892
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,520
He may not be a big criminal.
He must be a common person.

893
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,000
Anwar basha and Shenbaghamurthy
were killed in...

894
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,480
... that group of illegal friends.

895
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,280
Daniel is not here.

896
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,920
Mostly,next murder is of AMT's.

897
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,200
In all the incidents,
furious blood and...

898
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,320
...and revenge maniac is visible.

899
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,200
If not,it's not necessary to
murder so furiously...

900
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,800
... getting them to
isolated places.

901
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,520
"Curse of fire"

902
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,520
Thalangpur- Rajasthan

903
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,273
Sivamalai... Help...

904
00:59:31,173 --> 00:59:33,173
Water!

905
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,080
Sivamalai...
Sivamalai...

906
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,840
Give me water.
Give me water.

907
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,600
Save me.
Sivamalai...

908
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,080
Water...

909
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,960
Water...Water...

910
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,760
It's burning...It's burning...

911
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,000
Sivamalai...
It's burning.

912
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,120
Water...

913
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,000
What did you give me?

914
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,440
It's not water.

915
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,640
It's the acid used for polish.

916
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,080
You know, isn't it?

917
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,760
Save me.

918
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,360
Sivamalai
Water...

919
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,560
I'm your brother.

920
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,560
Save me.

921
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,840
Sivamalai.
It's burning.

922
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:32,840
Save me.

923
01:00:36,188 --> 01:00:39,029
It's burning...

924
01:00:49,189 --> 01:00:51,189
Sivamalai.

925
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,120
I'm an animal.

926
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,200
You mean animal?

927
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,280
No animal will betray
other's life.

928
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,480
You are worse than that.

929
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,240
When you left
the country and stayed in Haridwar.

930
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,160
I made you to come to Chennai
with the help of sister,Parvati.

931
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,280
Why are you here?
-You are not at all coming.

932
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,240
You come once.
-I'm not coming.

933
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,360
Hang up the phone.

934
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,600
I made you to come
to my house...

935
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,720
...when you were roaming
as a dog in Chennai.

936
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,640
Sivamalai!

937
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,520
I'm your brother,

938
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,320
Forgive me,Sivamalai.
Forgive me.

939
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,640
No.
No,Sivamalai.

940
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,880
Don't do anything.
It's burning.

941
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,320
Tears,the weapon which
breaks you.

942
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,720
It's painful when sculpting.

943
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,560
If you win, we must not
talk about that.

944
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,400
If lost, we must not be alive
to talk about that.

945
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,440
Think of the day,
you came to me.

946
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,640
Nothing will be painful.

947
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,600
Rishikesh- Beginning of Ganges

948
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:31,280
(Mantras recitation)

949
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,040
Shanthi...
Shanthi...

950
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,800
He gave life to the statue
and made it as god,

951
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,416
In return, God made him as a statue!

952
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,240
Blessed by Lord Shiva.

953
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,840
I calmed down Rudran.

954
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,960
He'll do the offerings formally.

955
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,160
You be with him.

956
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:55,720
Yes,swamiji.

957
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,920
As said in "Atharvana Veda",
give sacrifices at places of victory...

958
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,680
... and ensure there is,
no rebirth to demons.

959
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,720
Rudran will be with you.

960
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:05,920
Rudhram....

961
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,080
Aarudhram....

962
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,800
Aarudhram....

963
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,360
Rudhram....

964
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,760
Aarudhram....

965
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,040
Rudhram....

966
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,440
Aarudhram....

967
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,760
Rudhram....

968
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,840
Aarudhram....

969
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,880
The slayings will continue...

970
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,240
I was in Srilanka for past 15 days,
in a deep forest regarding a project.

971
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,880
Yesterday,after landing
in Chennai,

972
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,640
I came to know that Anwar basha
and Shenbagamurthy...

973
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,280
... were kidnapped
and killed brutally.

974
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,360
Now AMT sir was also kidnapped.

975
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,080
What's going on here,sir?
I just can't believe this!

976
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,560
Okay,now you need
police protection.

977
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:46,920
Thanks.

978
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:48,720
Just a minute.

979
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,480
No one can
near me,sir.

980
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:51,840
I'll take care of myself.

981
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,240
First,find out the murderers..

982
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,640
...and gun them down like dogs.

983
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,760
Sir,Daniel has come.

984
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:11,880
Didn't you go to meet him?

985
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,080
Why did you ask me
to follow Aavudaiyappan?

986
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,400
I know everything.
You better follow him.

987
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,440
In Jammu Kashmir, an eight years old girl
was brutally raped and killed.

988
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,280
Politician,Kamal Hassan
has condemned the act.

989
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:31,640
He tweeted, as a father
and as a citizen of the country...

990
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,600
... I'm enraged by the incident.

991
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,080
Few persons kidnapped
a girl child who was playing,

992
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,840
Confined her in a temple
for almost eight days...

993
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,640
... and mutilated her worst.

994
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,640
Took her to the forest
and killed her by choking.

995
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,440
At that time,even god didn't
see or question that.

996
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:52,480
You preach in every school.

997
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,400
Siva, we must do something
more than we talk.

998
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:02,360
AARUDHRA,
Centre for protection of girl children.

999
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,760
Daniel has come
from abroad,yesterday.

1000
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,480
He was missing from yesterday
after he went out.

1001
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:18,120
Sir,yesterday at 11a.m,

1002
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,520
Daniel was talking to me.

1003
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:23,040
He left with someone through
the back gate at 11a.m.

1004
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:27,240
He denied the security and
went driving on his own.

1005
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,120
I See

1006
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,800
Whether you rush
the investigation or not,

1007
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,440
...he rushes in kidnapping.

1008
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:34,640
Stop.

1009
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,480
Play back.

1010
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,040
More...
More...

1011
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:39,960
Freeze.

1012
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,600
Zoom forward.

1013
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,240
Why did he go there?

1014
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,320
It's very confusing.

1015
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,360
Sir...

1016
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,480
We own a heritage shop
near Velachery.

1017
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:02,840
Visit once,if you can.

1018
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,920
Siva,paste the address
and send that soon.

1019
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,000
He may get decomposed.

1020
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,560
Van has come.
Send the parcel.

1021
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,720
Siva,Aavudaiyappan is coming.

1022
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,880
Sir, welcome.

1023
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,440
You are expected
to come long back.

1024
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,360
Hope you got time now only.

1025
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:35,880
Welcome, sir.

1026
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,040
Have you come
to buy any gift?

1027
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,920
No,I need to do an inquiry.
You come.

1028
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,960
Aren't you in home,
yesterday morning?

1029
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,920
I went to meet an importan person.

1030
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:09,920
Who?

1031
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,360
A real estate business man,
Daniel.

1032
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:19,680
Why?

1033
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,480
Actually, he was back
from Ceylon yesterday.

1034
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,040
He called me to his office.

1035
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,080
We have a property in ECR.
That's in a litigation.

1036
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,880
He told he'll help me to sell.

1037
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,280
So,we both went there.

1038
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,160
What Siva,you said your property
is in litigation...

1039
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:41,880
...and asked me for help.

1040
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:42,920
But you brought me to
graveyard.

1041
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,240
Three projects are over,sir.

1042
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,040
You are the one left out.

1043
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,000
For two months
you're following me.

1044
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,240
But,I got time only today
to come here.

1045
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,880
We can come here,
Only, when the time permits.

1046
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,560
Hello,it's time to enjoy.
Still a long way to go.

1047
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,480
Okay,we'll get a patta
for this graveyard...

1048
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,080
...and will build 200 apartments.

1049
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,080
Siva!

1050
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,440
Siva!

1051
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,280
Siva,where are you?

1052
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:15,880
Siva!

1053
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,600
Siva!

1054
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,960
Siva, where did you go?

1055
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,840
Siva...
What are you doing?

1056
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,840
Not Siva...Sivamalai!

1057
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,760
Do you remember,
the statue of Rudramoorthy?

1058
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:03,360
"A tiger progress for hunting"

1059
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:11,440
"It streaks from the forest
to the country"

1060
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:20,680
"On the way,it search
for scamps"

1061
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:28,840
"It get the scales,for it's sin"

1062
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:37,480
"It's a promise,
the tears has a power"

1063
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:45,360
"It's a promise on your father,"
"God has eyes."

1064
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:53,320
"A tiger progress for hunting"

1065
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,200
When are you back?

1066
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,920
By 1p.m.,he dropped me
and left.

1067
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:08,600
Why, sir?

1068
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,760
What happened to Daniel?

1069
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:11,880
Nothing.

1070
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,280
Sir, you are tensed.
Have coffee.

1071
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,440
Thank you...

1072
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:16,880
You...

1073
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,480
He is an ardent devotee
of Lord Shiva.

1074
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,400
He won't even sip water
on the day of "Pradosha".

1075
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,840
The culprit must be
an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva.

1076
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,240
What's this box?

1077
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,000
A french clock.

1078
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,720
We are packing to Delhi.

1079
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,760
Will you send such
huge parcel also?

1080
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,000
For 5 feet clock,
this huge packing is a must.

1081
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,640
Boss,it's going on.

1082
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,480
It'll be going on.
We must stop.

1083
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,360
Okay.

1084
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,040
Come often,sir.

1085
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,600
What,sir?
Did you forget anything?

1086
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,720
I must see, what's inside?
Ask him to open.

1087
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,240
It's the package to Delhi.

1088
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,640
Sir,we packed for long haul
with much difficulty.

1089
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,880
Will you open now,
or shall I?

1090
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:15,560
Hello,

1091
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,680
Sir, didn't I tell you?
It's a clock.

1092
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,960
Will you repack?

1093
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,280
Yes...yes...

1094
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,680
Okay,sorry.

1095
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:39,480

1114
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,560

01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,200
"A tomb will be built on us."

01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,520
"Cut...cut...cut..."

1117
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,920

"Aarudhram"

1127
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,040
Jolitha,just a minute.
I'll come.

1128
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,920
Uncle,I got a dairy
in Siva's home.

1129
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,640
Different backgrounds
were drawn in that.

1130
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,920
Do you believe,that a person
can be packed alive in a box?

1131
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:05,280
Good question.

1132
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,400
If, it was like setting up of
oxygen source for heart surgery.

1133
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,920
This rat is alive for
so many days in the box.

1134
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,760
The reason is not only
oxygen source...

1135
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,520
... but also injecting steroid.

1136
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,960
Boss,if a 60kg weighing person
is packed and sent...

1137
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,840
... as a parcel to places,
won't anyone search in doubt?

1138
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:36,080
If we send such a parcel,
anyone might be dubious and search.

1139
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,960
But,when that's the profession,
and send such parcels...

1140
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,440
...no one will check.

1141
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,680
So,you confirmed
Siva as the culprit.

1142
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,000
No.

1143
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,600
But,within few minutes,
I'll confirm.

1144
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,480
Night-12:00AM.

1145
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,680
Boss,did you work earlier,
in bolt shop?

1146
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:17,080
I'm excited of this case, we do
instead of a squad.

1147
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,240
Hey, shut your mouth.
Police is coming.

1148
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,840
All art pieces.

1149
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:36,880
Hey, Manimudi!

1150
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,920
Hey,I have a doubt
when looking at this.

1151
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,440
I too have the same doubt.

1152
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:46,240
This vehicle was owned in 1898
by the queen of Nagpur, Mayavathi.

1153
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,040
Now who has the ownership
of that queen?

1154
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,520
That's the doubt, isn't it?

1155
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,600
It's not merely a mud
A rock.

1156
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,520
Thank you,sir.

1157
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,920
Note this words, carefully.

1158
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,440
In copper plate,16th century
Marathi language was seen.

1159
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,560
That style and this one
is similar, isn't it?

1160
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,560
Boss,you got the point.

1161
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,880
Idiot,Take a still.

1162
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:07,960
Here it is,boss.

1163
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,400
Steroid glucose.

1164
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,240
She's like our chick.

1165
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,280
I'll kiss her.

1166
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,600
He'll kidnap and pack
everyone from here.

1167
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,440
Uncle,

1168
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,480
Come here...Come here...
-What?

1169
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,880
Uncle,he might have
packed AMT here.

1170
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:39,920
You are correct.

1171
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,600
Fix this camera.

1172
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:54,600
Boss,AMT is not here,
Instead, a lot of evidences are there.

1173
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,720
"Slain in sky"

1174
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,400
"Immersal of mortal in water"
Okay,read.

1175
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,160
"Slaying in air"

1176
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,640
Keep it that side.

1177
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,560
Fool,why did you
switch on the light?

1178
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,960
I didn't,boss.
I thought you switched on.

1179
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,320
Will I ask you,
if I switch on?

1180
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,320
There!

1181
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:28,920
"A plaque of land."

1182
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:42,960
Morning- 5:00AM
Picchavaram forest- Rudramurthy temple.

1183
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:56,720
(Chanting Mantras)

1184
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:39,920
Do you know what I did
who accompanied you in sin?

1185
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,560
I'm sacrificing them
for "Five elements"

1186
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,360
Hey,Sivamalai.

1187
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,360
Hey, I was searching for you.

1188
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,320
Not known you...

1189
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,280
...I was wandering around
Aavudaiyappan,like a dog.

1190
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,400
Hey...
Lynch him and chop into pieces.

1191
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,400
Sir,
Have it. Please eat.

1192
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,920
No Problem sir.

1193
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,600
Hey...

1194
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:47,640
Chop and bury him.

1195
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,400
You don't worry.

1196
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,200
They'll cut and
bust him into pieces.

1197
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,000
We'll go.

1198
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:06,160
Hey, he must die
in front of me.

1199
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,360
I must see.

1200
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:31,800
Yesterday night 12:30 AM.

1201
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:32,720
Why did you
switch on the light?

1202
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,520
I didn't,boss.
I thought you switched on.

1203
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,720
Uncle,there!

1204
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,400
Boss,Siva.

1205
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,400
Siva,that is...

1206
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:48,200
What,sir?

1207
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,720
I asked you to come
at day for purchase...

1208
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,320
...but you have come at.night

1209
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,840
When came for a walk,

1210
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,720
The shop was opened.

1211
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,440
So...

1212
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,160
Whoever comes once,
to our shop,

1213
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,640
They'll come often.

1214
01:21:58,920 --> 01:21:59,800
Okay,cool.

1215
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,800
I'll come straight away
to the matter.

1216
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:07,920
AMT's friends were kidnapped
and killed brutally.

1217
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:12,160
Now,you have decided
to finish AMT also.

1218
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:17,360
That is, a psycho killer who lives
in the name of Siva,an innocent.

1219
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,320
Am I right?

1220
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,200
"Silence is the sign of
acceptance".

1221
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,480
I think i'm right.

1222
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,720
Yes, that box revealed
all the truth.

1223
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,880
I packed that box
to send you by courier.

1224
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,800
Again, knock out!

1225
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,160
I can't understand,Siva.

1226
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,440
Psycho killers like you
may feel...

1227
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,560
...happy and satisfied
on killing others.

1228
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,560
But, don't you think of
the family and other relations...

1229
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,360
...of the deceased?

1230
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,600
Don't you have a courtesy?

1231
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,280
Speak out.

1232
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:00,240

my native.

1233
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:04,560

1240
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,600
Everyone was born by
kisses only.

1241
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,560
What I mean is different from you.
-Tell me.

1242
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,680
Sivamalai did higher studies.
-Yes.

1243
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,680
What's that?

1244
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,200
Hey,what's that?

1245
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:34,960
B.pharm, mom.

1246
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,520
Yes,
giving medicines at hospital.

1247
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:41,080
But,he goes with his dad
along with chisel.

1248
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,880
You get him.
-What to do?

1249
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:47,520
In this country,the family dedicated
to art is downtrodden.

1250
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,320
As my sister said,

1251
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,240
why don't you come
to Chennai?

1252
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,680
I own a heritage shop.

1253
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,080
I'll pay 20k as salary per month.
Will you come?

1254
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:57,680
No,he won't.

1255
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,640
Even if you pay him in lakhs.

1256
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,480
He gives soul to divine eyes.

1257
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,040
Asking him to come
for the sake of money.

1258
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,360
Parvati and Nambi,
how are you?

1259
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,960
No complaints to say,uncle.

1260
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,440
Only the doors vary.

1261
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,160
But,we ever dwell here.

1262
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,200
If we get order for four statues,
they give us a share.

1263
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,560
Affectionate people.

1264
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,240
Listen!
That is his attitude!

1265
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,680
After my exams, my brother told
he'll buy me a two wheeler.

1266
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,760
Hey,Aaru.

1267
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,120
We can come to school
by two wheeler.

1268
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,200
Aaru,

1269
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,040
Hey...
-What happened, brother?

1270
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,040
Tell me.

1271
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,640
Today is your maths exam,
isn't it?

1272
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,040
Yes.

1273
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:40,920
You forgot.

1274
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,880
Writing pad, paper and
geometry box.

1275
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,840
Nothing I forgot, brother.
-What?

1276
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,240
Nambi took the vehicle.

1277
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,760
How much hard for me
to come by bicycle?

1278
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,720
Hey, look there.
A white crow.

1279
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,560
Hey,see here.

1280
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,280
To pray for your maths exam.

1281
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,480
I went to Periyandavar temple,
which is 10kms away...

1282
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,280
...and brought sacred ash.

1283
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,600
But,you forgot the holy ash.

1284
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,040
That's beautiful.

1285
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,320
My brother!

1286
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,000
Listen to me.
Keep it safe.

1287
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:07,760
Time up,

1288
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,600
Nothing.
-let's go.

1289
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,320
You write the exam well.

1290
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,840
Go safely.

1291
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,080
Instead of reading the book?

1292
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,000
Will you pass
by applying this holy ash?

1293
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,880
It's not just an ash,
it's the faith of my brother.

1294
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,280
You see,
I'll get pass.

1295
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:50,320
"Oh beloved,oh beloved,"

1296
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:58,040
"Oh beloved, oh beloved,"
"My words are sugar palm,"

1297
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,880
"Is that sweet?"
"Is that sweet,"

1298
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:06,440
"Along with my dear,"
"Cuckoo must sing,"

1299
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:09,440
"Does it agree?"
"Does it agree?"

1300
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:13,360
"I'm the mother to my father,"

1301
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:17,400
"I'm the father to my mother,"

1302
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,960
"I'm the dearest,"

1303
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:26,240
"Oh beloved, oh beloved,"
"Your words are sugar palm,"

1304
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:29,920
"It's sweet,"
"It's sweet,"

1305
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:34,200
" Along with my dear,"
"Cuckoo to sing,"

1306
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,920
"It agrees,"
"It agrees,"

1307
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:13,880
"Won't the peacock waft yearns
to groom my sister's tress?"

1308
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:22,280
"Won't all the flowers hesitate
to blossom before her?"

1309
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:26,480
"Like the ant which sleeps
under the mushroom,"

1310
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:30,440
"a nap on father's shoulder,"

1311
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:38,120
"With affection, even fermented rice
when served by mother becomes tasty,"

1312
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:42,080
"Will the heaven be
like our relationship?"

1313
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:46,200
"Will I get happiness as
on my mother's gesture?"

1314
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,320
"Tell me..."

1315
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:54,080
"Oh beloved,oh beloved,"
"My words are sugar palm"

1316
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,760
"Is that sweet?"
"Is that sweet?"

1317
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,320
"Along with my dear,"
" Cuckoo to sing,"

1318
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,800
"Does it agree?"
"Does it agree?"

1319
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:46,000
"Is Lord Muruga beautiful
in squire with peacock?"

1320
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:50,120
"Amuse with our peacock,"

1321
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:54,080
"The abode of god
is our homestead,"

1322
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:58,360
"The family deities is with us,"

1323
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:06,280
"Whoever comes to our house,
are welcomed by the chisel sounds,"

1324
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:14,240
"The love with no boundaries,"
"What the god expects,".

1325
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,960
"My brother's hands
are swings,"

1326
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:22,320
"My mother's tongue
pampers me,"

1327
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,960
Oh dear...!

1328
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,560
This is the house of
the chief sculptor.

1329
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,120
Welcome,sir.

1330
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:03,240
He is a big shot.
Owner of AMT Jewellery.

1331
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,560
Is anyone there who doesn't
know him?

1332
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:09,040
He comes oft times in
jewellery shop advertisement.

1333
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,560
He is seen even
if we switch off the TV.

1334
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:14,720
Sir,have coffee.
-Give him.

1335
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:15,920
No.

1336
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,200
No.
No.

1337
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,920
A remedy to family deity.

1338
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,240
I want to place a
statue of "Rudramoorthy".

1339
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,160
Heard that no one
can do other than him.

1340
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:25,440
The work must hasten.

1341
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:26,360
Take this.

1342
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:27,720
Dad!

1343
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:28,720
Get that.

1344
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:29,800
Okay.

1345
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,960
The amount is high.
-Hey,let it be.

1346
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,800
You are the god
who makes diety.

1347
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:38,440
Oh no.
Sir,you...

1348
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,760
He'll bear god in soul.

1349
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,160
And parents as God.

1350
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,360
Bless you to be good.
Come on...

1351
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,840
She is our last beloved.

1352
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,440
Yes,the one who must
go to shop.

1353
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:50,760
Sshh...

1354
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:51,920
Hey.

1355
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,840
Good,she is a chatter box.

1356
01:31:35,400 --> 01:32:17,120
(Chanting Mantras)

1357
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,920
Welcome,sir.
-Welcome!

1358
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:19,560
Mom.

1359
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,800
Welcome,sir.
Welcome!

1360
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:21,640
Why did you bring
him suddenly?

1361
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,600
He is so affectionate
on our family.

1362
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,120
He got Jewels
for our daughter.

1363
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,480
Sir,that's acid.
Don't touch.

1364
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,240
Boss,you clean up the hands.
Clean up.

1365
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,480
Take that chain.

1366
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,200
Why do you get jewellery?

1367
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,040
Aaru,dear.
Going to dance class?

1368
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:54,840
You've put on little weight.

1369
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,560
No, brother.
I'm 36 kgs only.

1370
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:04,000
Is it? you must be 40kgs.

1371
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,280
No,brother.
I'm 36kgs only.

1372
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,600
Shall I weigh you?

1373
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,200
Yes.check.

1374
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:21,040
We caress our girl children
but some snakes who comes...

1375
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,440
... to our house don't
see them as children.

1376
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,280
Like a cobra, Nambi,only in his
name, he had faith.

1377
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,440
But he was different.

1378
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:32,680
Why did you lift me?

1379
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,200
Step me down, brother.
Step me down, brother.

1380
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:50,080
Why the face doesn't
rest to Rudran?

1381
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,480
Do it with fulfilled heart.

1382
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:03,120
If the statue goes fault,we must
offer that to "Five elements"...

1383
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:06,120
...and destroy either in fire,
water or soil.

1384
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,880
That is "Shilpa sastra".
(Architectural rule)

1385
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,440
Better you go to Rudramurthy
abode in Pitchavaram...

1386
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,040
... and give a hen for sacrifice.

01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:28,000
Brother.

1389
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,080
Dried ginger coffee.

1390
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,360
You'll get it.

1391
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:36,880
Today,definitely you'll get the face.

1392
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:42,000
Aaru.

1393
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:43,760
Come here.

1394
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:45,360
No, brother.

1395
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:46,640
Uncleanness.

1396
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,160
Where is uncleanness for fire?

1397
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,040
Come in.

1398
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,240
You are the sign of fire.

1399
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,800
Keep your face still.

1400
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,600
Why did you do,so?

1401
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,200
Hey,wait.

1402
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,480
See here.

1403
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,920
See,the beautiful tab
of your face.

1404
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:18,600
Go.

1405
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:20,880
Is it good?

1406
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:21,840
Beautiful!

1408
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,800
This polynomials are
tough for me.

1409
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,080
I scored centum in Maths.

1410
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,400
Shall I teach you?

1411
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:26,640
Who?you?

1412
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,320
You would've got a zero.

1413
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:32,760
Okay,come here.

1414
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:34,600
What do you want to know?

1415
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,840
I don't understand anything,
brother.

1416
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,640
Okay.
-Tomorrow is exam.

1417
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:39,880
Is it?

1418
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,400
You teach me first.
-Let it be.

1419
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,800
See this video.
See.

1420
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,320
Be relaxed.

1421
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:50,920
What do you do?

1422
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,920
You keep on studying.

1423
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,040
Is maths so important?

1424
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:12,160
Nambi,what are you doing there?

1425
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,440
She has doubt in maths.

1426
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,680
So, teaching her.

1427
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,480
Will you come here?
-I’ll come.

1428
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:20,920
I finished the statue.
I ordered for the polish.

1429
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:22,200
I need help to hold the statue.

1430
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,160
Okay,you teach her.
I'll look after that.

1431
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,560
Sivamalai, I'll also come.

1432
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:32,760
You go and teach her the lesson.
Why are you coming?

1433
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:33,840
It'll be helpful.

1434
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,000
Nothing,I tied up the
statue in vehicle.

1435
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,360
Have to go.

1436
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,080
I must get that for polish.
Mom,I'm going for polishing.

1437
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,160
I'll come back by 5.

1438
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:44,680
Doctor has confirmed the
delivery on next month 30th.

1439
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,120
So shy he is!

1440
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:48,040
Go.

1441
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,080
Come.

1442
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:02,320
Sivamalai,

1443
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,480
You're working from
morning onwards.

1444
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:05,880
Put this betel.

1445
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,800
Parvati, what are you looking at?

1446
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:09,800
Don't have any other work?

1447
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,040
Go and do the work.

1448
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:16,760
Sivamalai, our girl is very much
worried about maths.

1449
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,560
The maths teacher
scolds her,it seems.

1450
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,960
She cries a lot.

1451
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,800
A coaching centre
is in Chidambaram.

1452
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,280
The teacher is called
as "Centum teacher."

1453
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:28,200
Rs.1200 as fee for
every month.

1454
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:28,800
I paid.

1455
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:30,720
Two days class in a week.

1456
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:31,880
Only on Saturday and Sunday.

1457
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,760
Don't want all that.

1458
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:35,640
Who'll accompany her?

1459
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,080
What are you saying?

1460
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,000
I'm here.

1461
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,800
Can't I do that?

1462
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:42,680
Mom,Nambi is the
true brother of Aaru

1463
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,080
You get her,brother.

1464
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,920
She must score full marks.
-Not for that.

1465
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:46,760
Samundi...

1466
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,560
Who is protective than Nambi,
in this world?

1467
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:52,040
Those who believe Nambi,
was never let off.

1468
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,080
Not for that.

1469
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,240
Whom do we believe
than Nambi?

1470
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:59,880
It's difficult for him to
accompany her regularly.

1471
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:37,200
How to convey in home
about Nambi's mischief?

1472
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:40,720
If I say, do they mistake me?

1473
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,200
Does god have kindness, brother?

1474
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,200
"God is the form of kindness".

1475
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:59,040
Then,why did he created
a beautiful deer...

1476
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,760
... and a tiger to hunt that?

1477
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,920
How does the god
have kindness, brother?

1478
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,360
Where are they?

1479
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:12,480
Sivamalai,I got offering from temple.

1480
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:13,400
Come,we'll have.

1481
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:14,280
Yes, coming.

1482
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:16,080
We'll talk tomorrow.

1483
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,600
Sivamalai,what both of you
doing there in snow?

1484
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,400
Come.

1485
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:23,160
I must tell about
Nambi to brother.

1486
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:39,160
Samundi mom,I wonder,
what are you busy with?

1487
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:40,760
It's getting late for consecration.

1488
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:41,560
Will you hurry up?

1489
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,280
I'm coming.

1490
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:43,240
Coming...Coming...

1491
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:50,000
Dear,what's the problem?

1492
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,320
You are upset from yesterday.

1493
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,480
You say philosophies.

1494
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,880
What happened?

1495
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:54,920
Nothing, brother.

1496
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,240
Nothing.

1497
01:40:58,920 --> 01:40:59,840
You do one thing.

1498
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:04,480
Pluck a rose flower
from our garden...

1499
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,400
...look at the mirror with a smile.

1500
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,840
You'll see two roses.

1501
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:09,960
How, brother?

1502
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,280
That's it.

1503
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,200
Come... come...

1504
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,600
My beloved, you must smile ever.

1505
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:17,560
Get up.

1506
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:18,280
Brother.

1507
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:22,080
Smile...

1508
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:24,200
Hey, you mud.

1509
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,040
Lifting a grown up,girl.

1510
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,000
Hey, leave her.

1511
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:27,680
Leave her.

1512
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,760
She attained puberty.

1513
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,600
Puberty?

1514
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,080
She is still a kid.

1515
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:32,920
She doesn't know anything.

1516
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:33,800
Put her in cradle.

1517
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:34,720
Is she a kid?

1518
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,080
She is 15 years old.

1519
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,680
Mom, dad and myself are
going to consecration...

1520
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:39,960
... on Wednesday in Nellithopu.
-Okay.

1521
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:40,560
We're leaving.

1522
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,280
Dad, I'll hold a seat in the bus,

1523
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:42,760
Come.

1524
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,280
Dear,I'm leaving.

1525
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:45,440
Don't be upset.

1526
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,400
Hey, it's raining.

1527
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:48,480
Why do you go today?

1528
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:49,840
You can go tomorrow.
-You be quiet,mom.

1529
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,640
No rain,no storm.
We must pass on.

1530
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,240
Mom!

1531
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,040
What,dear?

1532
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,000
Do you want dosa?

1533
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:56,280
How a baby is born?

1534
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,120
What?

1535
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:00,760
Baby?

1536
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:03,640
What do you ask about?

1537
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:06,840
That's why i told not to
befriend that Mayavaram girl.

1538
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:08,840
Are you listening us?

1539
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:10,240
Is this the question
you ask for?

1540
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:13,520
Hey Samundi, why are you
scolding her?

1541
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,160
Yes, listen to what your child
is asking about?

1542
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:20,440
As the parents hesitate to
talk about this to children,

1543
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,200
The children get into troubles.

1544
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:25,520
Everyday she travels
to Chidambaram to study.

1545
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,440
How dare she ask a question?

1546
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,640
Her legs must be painful.

1547
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,640
What,dear?

1548
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,000
Where is your anklet?

1549
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,080
Nambi took for polishing.

1550
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:35,120
Mom,I won't go to tuition
with Nambi, hereafter.

1551
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:38,160
He accompanies you
leaving over his works,

1552
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:38,760
Mom!

1553
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:39,760
You'll say more than this.

1554
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:43,040
Samundi,you keep here and go.

1555
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:43,880
Go...

1556
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,640
If Nambi is not here,
everything will go useless.

1557
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:49,640
Dear, I'm going to Nellithoppu
for consecration.

1558
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:51,080
Will you send me with smile?

1559
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:51,960
Smile now.

1560
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:55,040
Why do you ask her
to smile,now?

1561
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,000
What if she smiles or not?

1562
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,880
Whom we make to
smile,when alive...

1563
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,000
...they'll cry for us,
when we die.

1564
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:06,640
Just smile,once.

1565
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:07,760
Dad is leaving.

1566
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,320
Aaru...

1567
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,120
Give the anklet.

1568
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:27,720
Mom has left to temple.

1569
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:28,360
I must go.

1570
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:29,120
I bought it for you.

1571
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:29,440
Give.

1572
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:30,400
Give me.

1573
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,240
One condition.

1574
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:32,480
What?

1575
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:34,040
I'll put the anklet.

1576
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,840
It has become a
routine to you.

1577
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:40,840
Only once.

1578
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,200
Come.

1579
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:00,520
Hey,dog.

1580
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:03,880
How to manage him?

1581
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,560
Sir,the statue is ready.

1582
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:08,560
She is of tender age.

1583
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,120
To her...

1584
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,160
Forgive me,sir.

1585
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:12,720
Don't tell anyone.

1586
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:35,720
Aarudhra!

1587
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:37,320
Mom!

1588
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:38,680
Mom!

1589
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,400
Did you get the pain?

1590
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:41,840
Come fast.

1591
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,160
Sister,is everything ready?

1592
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:48,800
Yes, doctor.

1593
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:51,640
Aarudhra!

1594
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:55,960
Tell me Samundi.

1595
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:03,760
Aaru, dear!

1596
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,760
Aarudhra!

1597
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:16,000
Aarudhra!

1598
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:28,080
Aarudhra!

1599
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:38,240
Aaru, dear!

1600
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:41,240
Aaru, dear!

1601
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:45,480
Aaru! What happenend to you?

1602
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:47,160
Why are you kept like this?

1603
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:49,680
What happened?
Oh no...oh god.

1604
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:52,080
I can't see you suffering..

1605
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,560
I can't bear, dear.

1606
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,000
Aaru, Dear!

1607
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:02,240
Brother.

1608
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:04,920
Tell me.
What happened?

1609
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:07,040
Brother.

1610
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:09,280
Tell me.

1611
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,360
Nambi...

1612
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:12,480
Nambi...

1613
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:21,200
Hey,why are you afraid now?

1614
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,240
He said as only one person.

1615
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,440
He goes to Vietnam
for this matter only.

1616
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,880
How many cases
we have seen?

1617
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,080
Nothing will happen.

1618
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:35,680
You brought her to
perform a dance.

1619
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:37,040
Then what?

1620
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:37,880
Sir will take care.

1621
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:40,280
You said as only one person.

1622
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,240
But,four persons are here.

1623
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:43,520
What, if how many are here?

1624
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,600
The dance is the same.

1625
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:46,800
She is a young girl.

1626
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,880
Hey,What are you talking about?

1627
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,000
Here is five lakhs,
You asked for.

1628
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,480
Pick it up.

1629
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,080
He is satisfied.

1630
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:57,760
Okay.

1631
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:58,560
See now.

1632
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,960
Come here.

1633
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:28,840
Come.

1634
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:32,120
Come.

1635
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:48,400
Do you like pigeons?

1636
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,080
I love flowers.

1637
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:55,320
Flower.

1638
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:56,360
What flower?

1639
01:47:58,680 --> 01:47:59,600
Come.

1640
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,440
Sir,I must go home.

1641
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,440
Sir, I must go home.

1642
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,640
Sir.

1643
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:10,320
Come here.

1644
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:12,920
Hey.

1645
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,720
Hey. Come here.

1646
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,600
You dog.

1647
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,560
Brother!

1648
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,680
Where have you
brought me?

1649
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:19,000
It's the guest house
of AMT sir.

1650
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,280
He wants to see your
dance performance.

1651
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:22,840
That's why I brought you.

1652
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,360
Is it? AMT sir?

1653
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:25,320
Yes.

1654
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,880
Sir, take care of not indulging
me in any problem.

1655
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,560
Keep quiet.

1656
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,160
His pressure has increased.

1657
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:47,720
You are talking
about your problem.

1658
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,640
That's all.

1659
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,160
You don't be in panic.

1660
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:58,440
That doesn't work.

1661
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:01,560
Come,we'll bury on the way.

1662
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:02,400
Okay.

1663
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:09,760
Lift up.
Hurry.

1664
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,160
Shenbhagamurthy,hurry up.

1665
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:12,880
The forest officials might come.

1666
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,560
Come...

1667
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,320
Come.

1668
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,240
Hey, give her.

1669
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:46,120
Anyone may witness.
Come.

1670
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:48,120
Someone has come for hunting.

1671
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:49,880
Hurry up.

1672
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:54,160
Take the vehicle,soon.

1673
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,560
Our angel! sir.

1674
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:13,600
For 17 days,she suffered with agony,
pain and breathed last.

1675
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:15,240
Aarudhra!
She is our chid.

1676
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:22,120
"Who has beaten you?"

1677
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:24,800
"The abode of god"

1678
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,640
"The nest where the parrot lived"

1679
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:32,320
"Who demolished?"

1680
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:37,760
"Yesterday, in this nest"

1681
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:43,040
"The blossomed flowers
aren't here today."

1682
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:48,320
"I Can't bear"

1683
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:55,400
"Oh beloved... Oh beloved"

1684
01:52:55,400 --> 01:53:00,800
"Who has beaten you?"

1685
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,720
"The abode of god"

1686
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:06,480
"The nest where the parrot lived"

1687
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:11,960
"Who demolished?"

1688
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:36,480
Whom we make
to smile when alive...

1689
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,720
...they will cry for us,
when we die.

1690
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:43,800
"Dear, I never seen you sleeping."

1691
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:49,880
"You're not able to hear me."

1692
01:53:55,400 --> 01:54:00,880
"Who'll suffer for my sake?"

1693
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:06,440
"Even if I cry,
who'll wipe my tears off..."

1694
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:12,200
"Even the blood has become dry."

1695
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:17,640
"The veena has turned as firewood."

1696
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:23,120
"In the pearl palanquin,
the moon which came around,"

1697
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:28,320
"Have become a part of hearse."

1698
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:33,800
"Who'll console now?"

1699
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:42,720
"All the affection has turned into ash."

1700
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,600
They have thrown 25 lakhs
and asked to change the case,

1701
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:56,160
As the entire family committed
suicide because of debts.

1702
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:57,480
If not, they threatened that,

1703
01:54:57,480 --> 01:54:58,800
I'll be said as pander
to my sister.

1704
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:00,880
Ask him to accept.

1705
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,760
Better to accept, take the
money and leave.

1706
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:06,120
I was insane.

1707
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:07,480
Hey...

1708
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,760
Rudhra...!

1709
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:17,520
You left my family in perils
and standing with ten hands.

1710
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,520
"Veera rudraya!"

1711
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,960
"Gora rudraya!"

1712
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:23,240
"Theera rudraya!"

1713
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:24,280
"Yagna rudraya!"

1714
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,200
Is all the mantras a fake?

1715
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:29,600
I won't leave this.

1716
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,840
Why are you here?

1717
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,120
Why are you here?

1718
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,200
For what you need adoration?

1719
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:36,840
For what you need honouring?

1720
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,640
For what you need rituals?

1721
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:39,400
Go.

1722
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,600
Don't want.

1723
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,960
I'll destroy you with the
same hands that created.

1724
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:45,640
I'll destroy everything.

1725
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:48,000
Go away from here.

1726
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:13,120
As I was in dying situation,
my uncle and...

1727
01:56:13,120 --> 01:56:18,240
...my sister Parvati took me
to siddhar in North India and cured

1728
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:21,600
"Sivamalai" was changed as "Siva".

1729
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,080
I had a clear thought.

1730
01:56:23,600 --> 01:56:25,080
I planned well.

1731
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,560
I targeted each and everyone.

1732
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:28,280
I started hunting them.

1733
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:31,160
When said about
a ten year old girl,

1734
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:35,160
AMT came like a dog
and was caught.

1735
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,320
Siva, for taking revenge,
each and everyone...

1736
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:57,320
... has their own valid reason.

1737
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:00,720
That too,in your stance,
the reason is very strong.

1738
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:03,120
If you took action
on them as per law,

1739
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:04,560
you would've got the justice.

1740
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,160
The victim asks for justice.

1741
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:07,760
Even the culprit asks for justice.

1742
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:10,760
Only the money decides
whom must be given justice.

1743
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:17,240
Child abuse is not just
one or two incidents,

1744
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:20,440
A three years old child in Salem,
A five years old child in Namakkal,

1745
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:26,760
Recently,a child playing in street
was abused, killed and burnt.

1746
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:32,200
In capital city, Delhi, 462
abusement cases are registered.

1747
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,920
In India, for a year,
almost 1112 girl children...

1748
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,400
...whereabouts are not known.

1749
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:39,800
From Asifa to Aarudhra,
these lubricious dogs...

1750
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:42,400
... are chasing the girl children
for  hunting.

1751
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:49,160
How many culprits of child
abuse was sentenced to hang?

1752
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:52,880
For 25 years,we have imprisoned
three innocent people.

1753
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:57,200
In other countries,
on 10th day is the death penalty.

1754
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:59,680
If proved guilty,they'll be killed
with poison injection.

1755
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,760
In other countries, genitals are cut.

1756
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:03,240
But only here, the sexual offenders
are given bail...

1757
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:06,000
... released in three months,
and given machinery for survival.

1758
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,480
And protect them.

1759
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:10,280
This is the godown
mentioned by Aavudaiyappan.

1760
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:11,080
Search.

1761
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:13,000
To whom?

1762
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I latched up the police.

1763
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,360
To kill these demons there
must be a person like me, sir.

1764
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:21,720
The  black spot on my Aarudhra
must be washed away...

1765
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:23,680
... with the blood flowing in AMT's body.

1766
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:26,240
It's my responsibility
to get him punished.

1767
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:28,000
Tell me,where he is?

1768
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,800
He must be lying as a worm
under my sister's foot.

1769
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:35,240
The one who destroyed my family
is awaiting a severe punishment.

1770
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:36,160
Come on.

1771
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:37,240
Catch him.

1772
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:39,360
You made the police come.

1773
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:45,600
Quick.

1774
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:47,960
It's locked.

1775
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:48,920
Break it soon.

1776
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:53,160
What are you discussing
with him instead of arresting?

1777
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:56,760
Ask to trace out him
with his cell phone signal.

1778
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:57,720
Come on,quick.

1779
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:35,720
Hey.

1780
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,720
Madam, the tree has fell.
The vehicle won't go this way.

1781
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:09,880
I'll thrash you to death.
Die.

1782
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:19,120
Come on.

1783
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:29,040
No,sir.

1784
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,320
Leave me.

1785
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:51,000
Does god have kindness,brother?

1786
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:53,200
"He is the form of Kindness".

1787
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:58,480
Then why he created a
beautiful deer and a tiger to hunt?

1788
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:35,960
The amount is high,sir.

1789
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:39,200
You are the god who makes deity!

1790
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:47,480
"My beloved! My beloved"

1791
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:54,760
"My brother's heart can't bear, can't bear"

1792
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:58,040
"He stands as fire before the evil"...

1793
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:01,640
There is no safety,even for
the girl baby in the womb.

1794
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:05,240
In the society of sexual offenders,
we have to change ourselves...

1795
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:07,320
...as the government,the law,the police.

1796
02:03:07,320 --> 02:03:09,840
Then only we can safeguard
Our girl children.

1797
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:19,320
"I'll mingle as tears in the eyes,"
"I'll live."

1798
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:30,640
"Don't I have a mind?"

1799
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:36,800
"Shouldn't I live as a woman?"

1800
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:47,280
"The flowers which are buds,"

1801
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:53,160
"Won't the sin of sacrificing the buds go?"

1802
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:59,120
"Though it's said,the woman as goddess,"

1803
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:04,400
"Even there is no way
for little flowers to live."

1804
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:10,360
"Though thousands of temples on earth,"
