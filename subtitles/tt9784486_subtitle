My name is...

What are you doing here?

Come.

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,120
Oye beardo (beard guy), it's your ride.

26
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,000
Madam needs to go to Rameswaram.

27
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,360
What are you looking at, madam?

28
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
Give that here to me.

29
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,920
Come on, get inside, madam.

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,440
Sit down.

31
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,400
He's our stand driver madam..

32
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,080
He might look like a joker,
but he's a very good guy.

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,120
That's enough of praising me,
I'll see to it from now.

34
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,040
Go and come back safely.

35
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,840
Madam, it says that Rameswaram
is a one way route from here.

36
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,560
If you want I can stay
with you the whole day...

37
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,440
and then drop you off at the
Madurai airport, what say?

38
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,920
Maybe she does not know Tamil

39
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,320
I need a SIM card.

40
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,520
Yeah, we can check it out at the shop.

41
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,560
You go buy it and come.

42
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,920
I'll wait over here.

43
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,480
Go!

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,840
Can I get an Airtel SIM card?

45
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,240
Yeah, sure ma'am!
Can I have your ID proof?

46
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,640
Is it Malaysian?

Sorry ma'am

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,560
Do you have an Indian ID proof?

51
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,560
No! (Nods her head)

52
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
Our owner has specifically
told us to provide...

53
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
SIM cards only to people who
have an Indian ID proof.

54
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,200
Sorry ma'am!

55
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,600
Since I'm a Malaysian citizen,
they declined to offer me a SIM card.

56
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
You come here, I'll get you one.

57
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,400
Listen...

58
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,160
Give me your passport

59
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
Dear, she's a Tamil Nadu citizen too.

60
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,720
Sir, we can only provide a SIM
card with an Indian ID proof.

61
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,280
Oh okay! Give that here.

62
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,720
Here you keep this with you.

63
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,840
For this one you'd give us one, right?

64
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,280
Then give it.

65
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,560
How much is it?

66
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,840
100 Rupees

67
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,000
Which place are you from?

68
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,960
Ramanathapuram!

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,360
Why are you spoiling
your place's reputation?

70
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm from a similar place too.

71
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,600
Okay, I'll take your leave now.

72
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,880
Come on madam, let's go.

73
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,400
Come on, get inside.

74
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,920
Brother, thanks a lot for trusting
me and giving your ID proof.

75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,480
When I leave India, I will
deactivate the SIM card.

76
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,120
It's not a big deal, madam.

77
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,920
You can keep it even
when you're going abroad.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,680
Do you have some commitment to God?

79
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,200
It's nothing like that madam

80
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
It's just because of some debt issues,

81
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,560
that's why I'm growing my beard

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,440
So that no one can find or recognize me.

83
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,560
How many debts do you owe?

84
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,080
Even if they'd give that much to me,

85
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,600
I still won't be able
to sort out my debts

86
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,080
Because there's so much of it.

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
Oh come on madam,

88
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,520
you came to Rameswaram
for something good

89
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Why do you want to spoil your mood
by listening to my sob stories?

90
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,480

Brother, why didn't you
go back to Madurai?

153
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,680
No dear

154
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,000
I didn't get any ride.

155
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,720
I can't go just like that.

156
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,840
That's why I was asking them for some help.

157
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,000
Ohhh!

158
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,800
Have you come to go
sightseeing at Rameswaram?

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,600
Hmmm.

Yes, brother, tell me.

169
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,560
You're missing from the airport,
where have you gone?

170
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,160
I came to Rameswaram...

171
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,400
I have a foreign ride, brother.

172
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,760
You've spoilt my business and
now you're earning is it?

173
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,840
Brother, please don't talk to me like that,
I'm a cameraman.

174
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,560
I'm doing this job to pay your debts.

175
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,440
I'm with the foreigner.

176
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,520
Please, don't talk like that brother

177
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,160
If I don't put the money
in your account in 2 days,

178
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,760
you can hit me with your slipper.

179
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,240
You're in the Madurai airport
and you're lying to me is it?

180
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,840
Brother, I'll give the phone to the
customer; you can ask her if you want.

181
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,800
Madam, tell him that
we're in Rameswaram.

182
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,320
Hello!

183
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,680
Are y'all in Rameswaram?

184
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,280
Yes

185
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,880
The car is in Rameswaram.

186
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,120
What's your problem?

187
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,640
He broke my new camera madam

188
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,000
He hasn't paid for it yet.

189
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Ask about the rest of the story to him.

190
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,880
Here's your phone.

191
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,800
Are you a cameraman?

192
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,720
Yes!

193
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,040
Why did you break the camera?

194
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,160
Why will I break the camera, madam?

195
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,440
That's my God that provides my food.

196
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,240
I am a wedding videographer

197
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,120
These days they make you take
those pre-wedding duet videos right?

198
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,720
All my problems started from there.

199
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,480
All started from there.

200
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,280
Hello sir,

201
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,920
Sir, I've chosen a hit song.

202
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,920
Oh! Is it?

203
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,840
Play the song.

204
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,400
Oh my God!

205
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,280
- It's the latest movie, man.
- Yes sir

206
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,880
We want to dance to this song.

207
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,240
When is the wedding?

208
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,640
It's in the coming auspicious time.

209
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
At the age of dying, you
want to get married is it?

210
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,520
Sir, what are you
thinking about?

211
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,280
No, I was thinking of
which angle to shoot the video

212
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,880
I'll play the song, you dance to the beat.

213
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,760
(Song from 'Kolamaavu Kokila')

214
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
Hey!

215
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,520
What are you doing?

216
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,000
I told you to dance
to the beat and...

217
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,840
you're moving like you're
kicking the cow dung.

218
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,680
Come here, dear.

219
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,600
Darling don't fear, go.

220
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
He's a great cameraman

221
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,560
Come on this side, dear.

222
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,160
Stand this side

223
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,280
Move your body like this.

224
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,080
You shouldn't worry when dancing together.

225
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,440
What are you looking at, man?

226
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,720
As if you've seen some ghost.

227
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm only showing her the dance movements.

228
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,840
Here, hold this.

229
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,960
When I tell you,
you should play the song, okay?

230
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,360
Like this,

231
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
What is your name, dear?

232
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,600
Malar!

233
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,320
You're just as graceful as your name.

234
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,240
Teach me the steps too, sir.

235
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,080
Hey! Get water for me you idiot!

236
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,640
Go!

237
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,360
You look so beautiful
like Kolamavu Kokila!

238
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,560
How do you fall in love
with these monkeys?

239
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,160
Do you not notice good guys like me?

240
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,360
Sir, here's your water.

241
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,520
Don't you have any manners?

242
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,800
I'm talking to a girl and
you're coming and giving me water.

243
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,280
Move away!

244
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,840
Looks like a monkey who ate ginger.

245
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,080
See, what I mean to say is that...

246
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,640
Please come

247
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,840
Please, come.

248
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,960
Here, hold this.

249
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,040
The camera of mine and
the hard work of yours,

250
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,360
combined together will
bring us great success.

251
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,360
Is it, sir?

252
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,560
Then I should first
take a video of yours.

253
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,880
Sir, what is it?

254
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,800
You look exactly like the jewellery
shop owner in Ranganathan street.

255
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,640
Sir, let me tell you one thing,
your son will rule everybody.

256
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,920
I'm very happy!

257
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,280
Sir, come soon before the
auspicious time ends.

258
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,520
The day they got engaged is the
day the auspicious time had ended.

259
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,640
I'll be coming.

260
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,960
Yes, move along well

261
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,240
Dance like that

262
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes, like this

263
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,280
Hold her nice and tightly

264
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,200
Dear, You're gracefully
dancing like SNEHA

265
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,400
He's moving like he's
kicking the cow dung.

266
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,120
He won't set for you,

267
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,080
For biriyani you look at him.
Run away, dear.

268
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,400
Do you know to make biriyani?

269
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,560
I know to make Ambur biriyani.

270
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,080
You'll do man, you'll do.

271
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,480
- Give that to me sir.
- Why?

272
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,480
I want to take a video of you.

273
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,720
Oh, okay.

274
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,680
For generations we are using turban
on head and preparing biriyani

275
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,640
You are trying to
cook biryani in our vessel?

276
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
Oh my god!

277
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,600
Oh my God! My camera's gone.

278
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,880
If you don't pay me back
in 1 week, you're gone.

279
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,560
Go.

280
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay!

281
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,960
I feel so happy that after so many days,
today is the first time saw you laughing.

282
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
What is this place dear?
It looks new to me.

283
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,200
This is the camp I told you about.

284
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,840
This one is it?

285
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,400
You know about the
places that even I don't.

286
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,560
Officer will be here

287
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
Come on, let's go and have a look inside.

288
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,880
This is the A O office.

289
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,800
Please come inside and take a seat.

290
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,960
Please sit.

291
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,080
What made you come over here?

292
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,680
In 2009, May Month...

293
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,440
I became unconscious during
the time of my delivery.

294
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Looking at my critical condition,
a lady doctor...

295
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,160
had taken me by airlift to Malaysia.

296
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,440
I recently got to know that the baby
had survived during the delivery.

297
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,800
That's why I've come in search of it.

298
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,680
You've come back after 9 years.

299
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,640
That's not a baby

300
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,000
He's a boy who's now going to school.

301
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,560
Sir, it doesn't matter
whether it's boy or a baby.

302
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,560
The mother who gave birth
to her child has come in search of it.

303
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,920
Please just tell us where the child is,
we'll go and find it by ourselves.

304
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,320
According to the government rules,

305
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,480
information regarding the
people inhabited here,

306
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,880
can only be provided to the
police and revenue department.

307
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,920
We can't share that with someone else.

308
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,200
You can write to the police
and find out through them,

309
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,480
only then we can share
the details about your child.

310
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh!

311
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,720
I'll go to the police
station like you said

312
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,320
But can I see my child just for now?

313
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,400
Okay, I understand your curiosity.

314
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
I myself have only been here for 6 months.

315
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,200
Many people were
shifted to Chennai...

316
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,800
and Trichy after the storm
that came in 2012.

317
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,640
Like you said there
aren't any children here,

318
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,920
but only a few people and
that too only old people.

319
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,080
Anyway, it's better for you to give
a complaint to the police station.

320
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,840
Oh!

321
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,680
Brother, let's go to the police station.

322
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,160
Okay, thank you.

323
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,160
If you find any details about the child,

324
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,280
then please do call and inform us about it.

325
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,480
Okay, will surely do.

326
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,720
Thank you.

327
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,200
Even after 9 years,
there's no big change to this place.

328
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,640
The camp is just the same.

329
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,800
It's about how this place was built,

330
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,520
that's why there are no
major changes to it.

331
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,160
Whatever, if you get your child back,
that's enough

332
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,240
Come on dear, let's go

333
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,240
Come.

334
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,600
You do know where the
police station is right?

335
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,600
Hello, I'm asking you only!

336
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,920
When I look at your problems,
my problems are nothing, dear.

337
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,280
But, whenever you speak
I can't figure it out.

338
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,200
I can never be like you, dear.

339
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,200
I want to learn to be like that.

340
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,200
You want to go to the police station right?

341
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,200
I'll take you there.

342
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,400
Come, let's go.

343
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,240
Come, let's go.

344
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,360
'Mandapam, police station'

345
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,240
Sir, we need to give a complaint.

346
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,360
Please sit.

347
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
So tell me,
what's the complaint about?

348
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,240
Flashback is being narrated...

349
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
Oh!

350
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,400
Okay, please do write and
give us a written complaint.

351
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,360
Brother, do you have a pen?

352
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,320
Sir, do you have a pen?

353
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,680
Dear, you don't have
to be in a hurry.

354
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,200
The current inspector
has been transferred...

355
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,840
and it will take 3 days for
the new inspector to come

356
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,760
He is take investigate about the issue.

357
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,520
Sir!

358
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,160
What's the case about?

359
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,640
It's nothing much, sir.

360
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,880
It's about a child missing.

361
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,480
Madam, you please leave now
and come back after 3 days.

362
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960
Come dear.

363
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,200
Due to the compulsion of
the hospital management,

364
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,400
I forced people with normal
deliveries to do a caesarean.

365
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,200
Repenting for my sins I came
to Kasi and Rameswaram.

366
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,520
When I saw you in that situation,

367
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,960
I saved you and got rid of my sins.

368
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,560
When you were unconscious...

369
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,680
the government too helped
in airlifting you.

370
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,360
You survived and so did your child.

371
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,040
That guy, Thangadurai who
came along with you was the...

372
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,480
one who told me not to inform
Yazhini about the child

373
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,480
Or else she'd go back
to Sri Lanka to fight.

374
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,760
That's why I didn't
tell you about your son

375
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,080
Please forgive me.

376
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,760
Here dear, take some Pori.

377
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,320
I'm giving her the Pori to eat and
she's throwing it for the fishes to eat

378
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,080
Maybe foreigners are like that.

379
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,320
Dear, the Pori vendor told me

380
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,360
That for all my problems to solve,

381
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,160
I should go in the morning and
take a bath in the ocean,

382
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,040
followed by a bath in the
temple with 21 pots of water.

383
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,920
I thought I'd do that
and go home tomorrow.

384
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,840
Only when the new inspector gets back,
I will get the information from the camp.

385
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,840
Can you give me some company till then?

386
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,920
I'll pay for the overall charges.

387
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,520
That's okay dear, I will be with you.

388
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,680
If you want shall I book a room for you
too in the hotel that I'm staying in?

389
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,160
There's no need of that dear.

390
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,800
Why do I need a room?

391
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,720
I'll sleep in my car.

392
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,640
Dear, if too you take a bath
in the ocean in the morning,

393
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,120
then you will get back
your long-lost son.

394
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,360
I'll come in the morning.

395
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,280
Is it?

396
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,680
You'll come right?
Okay.

397
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,600
(Chanting)

398
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,080
Can we keep the bag here?

399
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,320
Give it here, dear.

400
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
What are you just keeping it
and going like that?

401
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,400
Sir, we're just going to
take a bath in the ocean

402
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,560
Please take care of this
bag for a little while.

403
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,720
Okay, go and come back soon.

404
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,080
- Okay sir, come dear.
- Let me remove my slippers.

405
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,560
Oh! Yes, please remove it, dear.

406
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,920
Come.

407
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,400
Oh! So we must bath here and
also take a bath in the temple is it?

408
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Yes, dear!

409
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,280
They'll pour 21 pots of water.

410
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,960
Oh! So after this we must take
a bath in the temple as well.

411
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,560
Dip yourself three times
nicely in the water;

412
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,200
let all your problems go.

413
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,640
All my problem comes to end.

414
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,680
(Chanting)

415
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,360
You people came to the police station
yesterday to give a complaint right?

416
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,600
Who are you?

417
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,720
He's the inspector we saw
yesterday at the police station.

418
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,800
I couldn't even recognize him.

419
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,880
He said that the child was missing.
From when was the child missing?

420
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,960
She gave birth to her baby in 2009...

421
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,480
when she was unconscious and then
left the child and went to Malaysia,

422
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,600
So she's come here to get her child back.

423
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,600
Yeah, who are you though?

424
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,400
I am a taxi driver.

425
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,360
I've brought from Madurai.

426
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,920
Okay!
Who told you to give a complaint?

427
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,760
I only told... (Interrupted)

428
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,800
I went to Mandamp camp;
they insisted me to give a complaint.

429
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,080
When each of you go like that,
they'll tell you to follow the procedure.

430
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,640
What to do, sir?

431
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,840
They make us wander about like this.

432
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,400
You people go to the temple,

433
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,680
finish your prayers and get
back to the police quarters

434
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,920
I'll go to the camp and have a check.

435
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,320
You won't be coming to the temple is it?

436
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,000
I only go to the Perumal temple.

437
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,560
And also maintain some
distance with such drivers.

438
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,840
He's not the way you think.

439
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,840
He's a very nice person.

440
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,680
After you worship the God
go to the quarters to have break fast

441
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,080
I guess that the temple
will be very crowded today.

442
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
I'll do one thing,

443
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,160
I'll send my constable along with
you and he'll take care of you.

444
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,000
Okay?

445
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,120
Here, sir.

446
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,480
Come on let's go, dear.

447
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,640
Constable, call me
after you're done.

448
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,320
Okay sir, I'll take care.

449
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,520
Go!

450
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,720
It's only been 2 months
since sir came here.

451
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,520
When he came he was normal.

452
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,480
Don't know what the
priest told him...

453
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,440
that he start growing a ponytail
and became very holy.

454
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,040
The superintendent of police didn't like
that and transferred him to Chennai.

455
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,080
What did he tell you, dear?

456
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,160
He told me that you've come here alone,

457
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,720
so be careful.

458
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,760
Policemen always see
everything in suspicious way.

459
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,520
He didn't say anything like that

460
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,080
Come let's worship God.

461
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,840
Sir's wife is a sub-inspector in Chennai.

462
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,680
Oh! So he's been living alone
in the police quarters.

463
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,360
That's why sir eats at the mess.

464
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,280
Oh.

465
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,600
Hey driver, go have something to eat in
the nearby hotel and come and wait here.

466
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,400
Okay.

467
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,480
Sir?

468
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,600
Come in!

469
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,240
Greetings sir!

470
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,240
Did you people finish the worship?

471
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,480
I showed them everything in the temple,
just like you said.

472
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,280
Can I take your leave, sir?

473
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,160
- You may leave now
- Okay sir.

474
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,840
You please come inside.

475
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,840
Come.

476
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,440
Please sit.

477
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,400
Thank you!

478
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,040
What would you like to eat?

479
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,520
Anything's fine.

480
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,920
Why did you leave your
child and go in 2009?

481
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,040
Where's your husband?

482
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,600
Don't feel so much.

483
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,880
You don't have to say if it's personal

484
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,560
They shot him in front of my eyes

485
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,680
They brought me in the boat to Rameswaram,
while I was pregnant.

486
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,200
Hello!

487
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,280
Ragavachari?

488
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,160
Yes sir?

489
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,920
You get relieved today.

490
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,720
Okay, sir.

491
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,440
I'll tell Kumaresan to take charge.

492
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,200
Okay sir!

493
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,400
Thank you, sir.

494
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,840
I've been relieved today.

495
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,240
You go to the camp.

496
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,600
I'll talk to you on the phone.

497
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,480
It'll be helpful if you come.

498
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,680
I'll be at the camp
in 20 minutes...

499
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,640
after completing all the
formalities in the station,

500
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,640
Okay?

501
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,880
The inspector looks like a good guy.

502
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,520
He'll surely find your child.

503
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,400
Have you been waiting for long?

504
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,320
Let's go see and find out the details.

505
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,200
You stay here

506
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,520
You please come.

507
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,440
I just said that he's nice and by then...

508
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,280
he cut me off like that.

509
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,960
Come in

510
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,720
Come in sir.

511
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,880
Please sit.

512
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,680
It seems that she had left
her child here in 2009.

513
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,920
She came here yesterday

514
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,800
And after that I searched for the records,

515
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,720
But only the records after 2014
are available here.

516
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,560
Then what about the records before 2014?

517
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,600
They were sent to the Chennai
office to computerise them.

518
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,160
Where's the person who dealt
with the records of 2009?

519
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
He's now a deputy director in Chennai.

520
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,560
I spoke to him yesterday on the phone.

521
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,400
What did he say?

522
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,760
Because of madam's
complication in her pregnancy,

523
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,080
she became unconscious...

524
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,400
and was later admitted in
a hospital in Madurai.

525
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,680
Due to her critical condition, a Malaysian
lady doctor had taken her to Malaysia.

526
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,840
Then what about my child?

527
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,200
It seems that the premature baby
was very serious at first,

528
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,080
But it later got recovered after few days.

529
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,320
How do we gather information
regarding the boy?

530
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,480
You can find out the details about
the boy in the Chennai office...

531
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,400
or the Sri Lankan high commission office.

532
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,640
Okay, thank you.

533
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,280
Thank you.

534
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,960
I'll join you after I change my clothes.

535
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,920
We'll leave to Chennai in this car.

536
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,360
Okay!

537
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,320
Get inside!

538
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,240
I'll be back after half an hour.

539
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,040
Thanks you so much for waiting for me.

540
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,280
Once we reach Chennai,

541
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,480
I'll do my best to help you out.

542
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,480
Madam, here's your tea.

543
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Madam, please don't get angry with me.
I haven't slept well since 2 days.

544
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,240
Sir told me that he'd like to drive now.

545
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,680
Can you please sit on the front seat?

546
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,880
So that I can sleep behind?

547
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,480
- Okay
- Get down carefully.

548
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,560
Carefully.

549
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,680
Don't spill your tea.

550
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,320
Okay, let's leave.

551
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,320
There are hardly only few days
left for my life to end.

552
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,760
Don't tell like that

553
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,520
You will be alright

554
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,920
I'm a doctor

555
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,320
Don't I know.

556
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,040
I have faith, you don't tell negatively

557
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,560
Listen to what I say

558
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,520
Go to India,
find your son and live with him.

559
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,120
A girl cannot live alone like that.

560
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,880
What happened?

561
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,200
I was thinking about my life.

562
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
I wanted to give birth to my child,

563
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,960
when my husband was
beside me in Sri Lanka.

564
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,920
It's not in our hands;

565
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,520
it's only in Lord Perumal's hands.

566
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,280
Greetings sir!

567
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,960
- She's the one I told you about.
- Okay, sir.

568
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,080
- Please do provide a room for her.
- Okay, sir.

569
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,480
- My jeep will be here soon.
- Okay!

570
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,560
I'll take your leave now.

571
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,960
I will call you once I reach.
Okay.

572
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,040
Please come, madam.

573
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,960
- Brother?
- What is it dear?

574
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,600
How much is the car's rental fee?

575
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,000
You already settled the
payment for your trip...

576
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,920
...from Madurai to Rameswaram
at the airport.

577
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,880
The trip from Rameswaram to Chennai
costs 10,500 rupees.

578
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,600
Here, take it.

579
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,600
There's 20,000 rupees, dear.

580
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,680
Take this on my behalf for
taking good care of me,

581
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,960
and for also sorting out your debts
behalf of taking this.

582
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,960
Thank you very much, madam.

583
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,320
Let me get my son back

584
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,600
and then I'll sort out
all your debts myself.

585
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,000
Go safely.

586
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,600
For your kind heart, you'll
surely get your son back.

587
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,520
I'll pray to my deity for
you to get him back.

588
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,000
I'll take your leave now, dear.

589
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,880
Did you see Munnusamy?

590
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,720
I did see it, sir.

591
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,920
He is accepted to give money

592
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,120
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, sir

593
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,320
Yes, sir!

594
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,280
Good morning, sir!

595
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
Sir,

596
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,560
It made me very happy
when I heard your voice,

597
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,440
while you were
sending the jeep away.

598
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,240
Sir, do you remember Kolathur station?

599
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,600
When you were the sub-inspector,
I was a constable.

600
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,720
Since then I've always liked you very much.

601
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,240
You did a great job
with the Leelavati case.

602
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,000
Sir,

603
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,720
Except you, this style of yours
won't suit anyone from our department.

604
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,080
He started again.

605
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,640
If he keeps going on like this,

606
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,240
it looks like this inspector
won't even last here a month.

607
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,360
- Go, see to your work.
- Okay, sir.

608
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,400
Sir, would you like to have
some tea or coffee?

609
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,360
I'll let you know when I want it.

610
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,200
Okay, sir.

611
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,520
Sir, the assistant commissioner
wants to speak with you.

612
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,720
Okay, I will speak to him.

613
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,560
Okay, sir.

614
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,120
Why is it so dirty here?

615
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,040
Hello!

616
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,120
Hi!

617
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,520
I totally forgot.

618
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,720
Tell the driver to come here.

619
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,680
I'll pay for the cab.

620
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,080
I settled the payment.

621
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,200
How much did it cost?

622
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,120
I paid him 20,000 rupees.

623
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,720
That's too expensive.

624
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,480
But, he's having some debt issues

625
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,960
He's a good guy, that's why I
gave him some extra money.

626
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,680
So you're feeling pity for the driver.

627
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,600
Dr. Muthumeena saved my life
and accepted me as her heir,

628
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,800
that's why I have this
much of money.

629
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,960
I'm very happy to be friends with
such a rich person.

630
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,440
Is the hostel comfortable?

631
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,720
It's very dirty,

632
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,720
Too much of dusts.

633
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,640
I'm feeling very uncomfortable.

634
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,520
Okay leave it,

635
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,160
I'll check for some other alternative.

636
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,120
Okay!

637
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,360
Okay.

638
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,320
Oh shit!

639
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,840
Hello!

640
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,800
Yeah, tell me.

641
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,480
Why did you directly go to the station,
instead of coming home?

642
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,160
I came to take charge of the station,

643
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,480
but how did you know that I was here?

644
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,000
My constable said that
she saw you,

645
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,120
-while she was going towards the
ladies hostel gate.

646
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,960
It seems that you've shaved your head.

647
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,840
I'll come home and tell you
the entire story. Keep the phone.

648
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,560
Why?

649
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,520
Which guy were you looking
at standing at your college entrance?

650
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,280
Tell me who that guy is?

651
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,680
- Who's that guy?
- Stop hitting me

652
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
- Tell me.
- It's hurting me.

653
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,560
Tell me, who is it?

654
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,680
It's hurting me.
Stop hitting me

655
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,200
Tell me who that guy is?

656
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
That's Malar right?

657
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,880
Let's go have a look.

658
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,080
- I am not a fool
- What is he hitting her like that for?

659
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,200
- Hey, leave her man.
- Tell me, who is it?

660
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,040
You're Malar right?

661
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,160
Yes

662
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,680
What dear, you've become like a
flower that has lost its colour.

663
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,320
Cameraman sir, you told me that time
that I shouldn't marry this guy,

664
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,160
I didn't listen to you
and I'm suffering now.

665
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,920
- Who's suffering?
- Don't hit her man.

666
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,000
Hey!

667
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,280
That day I broke your camera and
today I'll break your car.

668
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,160
You leave better

669
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,200
Hey! Don't do it man,
if you break the car I'll be damned.

670
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,040
Oh God!

671
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,800
Go!

672
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,920
- Come here,
- Yes, sir I'll come

673
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,920
Sir!

674
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,120
I made a girl I know stay in a hostel

675
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,040
But she says that the
hostel isn't good.

676
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,760
If you know a good one, then let me know.

677
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,960
Sir, after you've told me this, will
I be without finding one for you?

678
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,040
I'll look out for one immediately.

679
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,760
Okay, go

680
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
They've started having
secret conversations now;

681
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,800
don't know what's going
to happen from now.

682
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,240
Hi little one!

683
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Hi daddy!

684
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,840
Mom, look at dad.

685
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,120
He's shaved his head and
is having a little pony.

686
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,160
Who are you trying to
cheat with this disguise?

687
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:00,920
Huh?

688
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,640
You'll never change,
be just like that.

689
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,960
In Rameswaram, a priest
saw my horoscope...

690
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,160
and told me that if you need peace,

691
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,440
Dad, it looks so funny.

692
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,360
My friends in school will make fun of me.

693
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,040
Somebody told him this and he followed it.

694
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,640
You have done all the atrocities and are
now portraying yourself as a saint.

695
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,920
Girl, from now onwards you won't
get any non-vegetarian food,

696
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,600
you'll only get curd rice.

697
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,720
A man will find peace just by
keeping his wife and children happy.

698
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,600
Tell your father to get out of
his disguise and get to work.

699
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,080
I'm going to Kancheepuram
for 3 days to work.

700
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,840
I'll come and see to it.

701
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,000
Say, "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna,"
your memory power will get better.

702
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,160
There's some work in court madam,

703
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,360
but sir told me that,

704
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,200
I should bring you here.

705
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,920
That's why I brought you here.

706
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,320
Please come, madam.

707
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,760
Sir!

708
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,920
Did you meet the officer?

709
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,320
Sir, he said that he'll
speak to you on the phone.

710
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,160
- He had told madam that.
- Oh! She spoke to him is it?

711
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,640
Hello!

712
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,360
- Is it inspector Ragavachari sir?
- Yes, tell me.

713
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,920
You made an enquiry right?

714
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,680
Yeah!

715
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,040
It seems that the family that was
in the Mandapam camp is now in Nanganallur.

716
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,760
Okay

717
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,600
I've sent you the address through SMS.

718
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,840
You enquire there, you'll get
the details from them.

719
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,240
Sir, thank you so much
for helping us find the boy.

720
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,160
It's okay, sir.

721
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,280
Sir, I'll require your
help to solve this issue.

722
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,040
Sure, sir.

723
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,760
- Certainly.
- Thank you!

724
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,400
They've identified a family
that lived there.

725
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,320
You'll surely get details about your son.

726
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,800
Hey! Take her and go show her the place.

727
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,480
Okay, sir.

728
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,960
Yeah. please come.

729
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,160
- Okay sir.
- Okay.

730
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,080
According to our inspector,

731
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,680
if you give him some work
he'll somehow finish it and give.

732
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,120
That's his character.

733
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,520
You'll surely get your child back, madam.

734
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,800
He will find him.

735
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,400
This is the hall, madam.

736
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,640
It's fully furnished.

737
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,280
He's kept everything ready for you.

738
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,280
You don't have to newly buy anything.

739
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,440
This is the prayer room.

740
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,640
All the Gods are inside, pray nicely,
you'll surely get your son back.

741
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,440
Madam,

742
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,800
the owner is so good hearted that
he's installed an air conditioner in the hall

743
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,680
Okay madam?

744
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,920
Come let's have a look at
the kitchen and bedroom.

745
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:00,960
Come

746
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,800
This is the bedroom

747
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,160
This is the bathroom.

748
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,040
Have a look, madam.

749
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,520
It's for lease for 10 lakhs, madam.

750
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,280
If you have any doubt,
then you can talk to sir about it.

751
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,760
They won't give it for rent is it?

752
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,320
They won't give it for rent, madam.

753
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,240
It's only for lease.

754
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,000
We can ask them to
reduce the amount.

755
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,840
Okay madam?

756
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,520
Come let's leave.

757
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,320
Sir, is this the Nanganallur inspector?

758
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:25,920
Yes, sir.

759
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,720
Sir, I'm Vadapalani inspector
Ragavachari speaking.

760
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,840
Sir, it's you.

761
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,080
Your hairstyle is the talk of the town.

762
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,760
Leave that.

763
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Sir, I'll send you the address of a
Sri Lankan family through SMS.

764
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,320
Okay, sir.

765
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,000
Can you gather their details
and inform me about it?

766
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,800
What's the matter sir?
Is anything serious?

767
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,720
Sir, I need to find out
about a missing child.

768
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,360
Okay, sir.

769
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,440
I shall gather all the details
and get back to you.

770
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,640
Thank you, sir.

771
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,760
Do you like the house?

772
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,720
Yeah, I like it.

773
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,680
I'll send her and come back.

774
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,680
Sir, she liked the house very much.

775
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,280
If we get 10 lakhs from her, then
we can make a lease agreement.

776
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,880
Hey, we don't even know for long

777
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,400
she's going to stay then why do
we need 10 lakhs?

778
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,440
Sir, the owner has a debt of 8 lakhs.
Ask her to give at least that amount.

779
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,240
Hey, is this for you or the other person?

780
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,280
Sir, if we earn somehow like
this, only then can we survive.

781
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,560
It is foreign currency,
let her give it.

782
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,480
Is this person trustworthy?

783
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,880
They will give the money back
while shifting right?

784
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,520
Sure, sir.

785
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,480
Sir, I'll take the
responsibility for it.

786
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,680
You go with her.
I'll leave

787
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,480
Okay, sir.

788
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Only if we give all the details to HSBC bank,
we can transfer the money by today.

789
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,720
Sir, told us to go to MGR Nagar
Indian bank right?

790
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,040
Yeah

791
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,880
Okay sir.

792
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,520
I'll check it out.

793
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,120
Sure, sir.

794
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,760
- Good morning, sir.
- I'll keep the phone.

795
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,440
Yeah, tell me?

796
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,280
Inspector Ragavachari had sent us

797
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,120
Please, be seated.

798
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,480
- To open an account for her.
- Sir, please sit down.

799
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,000
The inspector told me to open
an NRI account for you.

800
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,240
There's no problem, we can get it done.

801
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:06,640
Yes!

802
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,120
Please give me your details, so that we can
have a check and proceed further with it.

803
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,240
Okay, everything's correct, madam.

804
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,280
Please fill your details in this.

805
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,000
Here give this at the cash counter
and collect your cash.

806
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,120
Thank you, sir.

807
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,960
Welcome sir,

808
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,160
Thank you.

809
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,920
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome

810
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,120
You don't have to count.

811
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,200
It must be correct.

812
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,600
Nice bank.

813
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,360
Thank you!

814
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,600
You're welcome, madam.

815
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,920
Why so late?

816
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,520
You're getting signatures
for 8 lakhs right?

817
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,160
Please give me one and a half lakh.

818
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,320
Now, you come and talk to me.

819
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,880
My son is asking for an auto rickshaw.

820
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,400
If you buy your son
an auto rickshaw,

821
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,880
he will drive it by being high on booze.

822
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,160
You're showing me your true colours
once the money came.

823
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,280
You know this place only because of me.

824
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,080
Listen, I've got this money from
the inspector and I have to give it back.

825
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,040
If you want I can give you 50,000 rupees.

826
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,760
Yeah, when did you ever
give what I wanted?

827
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,240
Always keep doing the free praises.

828
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,400
Okay, the inspector must be waiting.
Come, let's go.

829
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,280
Greetings, madam!

830
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,200
Are you doing fine?

831
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,960
Hey, there are calls coming
from the assistant commissioner of police.

832
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,080
Without you, nothing will move, sir.

833
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,840
- Please sit down.
- Please be seated.

834
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,680
The house is in your name right?

835
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,400
Yes, sir.

836
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,560
Take out that document.

837
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,200
Sir, there are 2 copies of it.

838
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,680
There's one copy for that madam
and another one for this madam.

839
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,560
Read carefully, dear.

840
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,360
Here.

841
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,120
You'll only give it for lease is it?

842
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,960
You won't give it for rent?

843
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:06,840
Madam,

844
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,640
these days in Madras they
don't give houses for rent,

845
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,920
they only give it for lease.

846
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,680
Please put your signature
before the auspicious time gets over.

847
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,320
You put your signature after she does.

848
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,640
Let madam put it first.

849
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,440
Okay, madam.

850
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,920
Madam now you can put your signature.

851
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,480
You can keep this copy with you.

852
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,880
Madam, keep this safely with you.

853
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,000
There's totally 8 lakhs in this.

854
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,760
I know, madam.
I came with you to the bank

855
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,720
It will be perfect.

856
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,160
Careful madam, please
keep it safely with you.

857
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:55,960
Okay,

858
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,720
I'm continuously getting calls.
I will come in the evening.

859
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,800
Yeah, let's go sir.

860
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,120
Okay madam.

861
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:11,680
Hey!

862
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,680
Whose house is this?

863
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,840
Sir, this madam...

864
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,000
It's the same house right?

865
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:16,840
Yes, sir.

866
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,040
I know sir since the time
he was a sub-inspector,

867
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,160
but he didn't have a ponytail at that time.

868
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,560
Sir, the owner of this house
got a loan and ran away to...

869
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,840
...another city, because he
couldn't pay the money back.

870
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,240
He gave the key to her,
before he left.

871
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,200
That's why we thought of doing
some rotation of money till then.

872
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,000
Hey, what if some problem comes?

873
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,840
Sir, that lady likes this house a
lot, so there won't be any problem.

874
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,920
That person won't come back again.

875
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,200
Yesterday, while madam was bringing
the money outside the bank,

876
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,760
the manager himself came
outside to help her out.

877
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,560
She must've deposited
a lot of money.

878
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,520
Sir, I need to tell you
another important thing,

879
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,360
She have a lot of respect for you.

880
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,600
Hey, keep quiet man.

881
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,680
Sir for all the help that you're doing,
this isn't a big deal.

882
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,840
Okay, bring 2 lakhs and give
it to me at the station.

883
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,200
I have a lot of expenses.

884
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,280
Hmmm...

885
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,200
You're very popular.

886
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,800
There won't be anybody else
asking for a share right?

887
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,320
You'll only get 5,000 rupees.

888
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,960
Greetings sir!

889
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,120
Yeah, I got information
that a Sri Lankan

890
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,760
family has come from Rameswaram.

891
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,960
Do you know where they are?

892
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,280
There was a family
but they have gone back to Sri Lanka

893
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:17,760
Okay.

894
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,760
It has been many days
since they have gone.

895
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,480
Are you doing fine?

896
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,160
I came to your house
to meet you,

897
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,280
but you weren't there.

898
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,720
Is your phone
number the same?

899
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,680
Hey!

900
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,440
I had asked you to have a
check on Munusamy's matter, did you?

901
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:31,960
Yes, sir

902
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,840
Stop whiling away the time.
Go now!

903
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,400
Okay, sir.

904
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:34,640
You don't see any fair person.

905
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,400
You seem to be worse than
my 3rd husband who ran away.

906
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,680
You made me come up
to the police station.

907
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,400
Hey?

908
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,800
Will 50,000 come
from the air?

909
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,440
You got to work hard
for it, got it?

910
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,120
Look here...

911
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,960
That guy is trying to make
a 2 lakhs out of us,

912
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,920
so we have to foil
his plans now.

913
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,760
Okay?

914
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,480
Sir!

915
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,800
I last saw you while
receiving the money.

916
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,680
Sir, I have the
money intact.

917
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,120
- What is she saying, man?
- Sir

918
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,560
I was about to
tell you that

919
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,160
she's scared that if she
gives you the 2 lakhs now,

920
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,040
then with the 6
lakhs that was received,

921
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,960
she had to sign for
receiving the 8 lakhs.

922
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,120
For what should you
be scared for?

923
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,160
Shall I give you
an idea, sir?

924
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,840
If you change the house agreement to
your name, then even if that lady vacates,

925
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,560
you will still be able
to maintain that house sir.

926
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,960
Then what should we do with
the old agreement?

927
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,200
We can tear that off, sir.

928
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,040
If you wish anything can happen.

929
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,320
I'll get it signed from, sir.

930
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,400
Take it out soon.

931
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,400
Sir, keep this
2 lakhs with you.

932
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,760
Give that agreement
to me, dear.

933
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,320
Let's get it signed from sir,
before the auspicious time ends.

934
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,960
Sir, please put your
signature here.

935
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,640
Dear, you too put
your signature.

936
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,000
Here, sign it.

937
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,400
Okay sir, you keep the
copy of what she signed.

938
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,920
Here you keep this
with you, dear.

939
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,440
Sir, keep it safely at home.

940
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,680
You go, dear.

941
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,000
Sir, I will send her
off and come.

942
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:50,880
Okay.

943
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,640
Here, drink milk.

944
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,160
No, I don't want
it, you drink it.

945
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,320
I finished drinking,

946
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,280
I got this for you.

947
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,840
I'll drink it later.

948
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,960
Didn't your astrologer tell
anything about your tattoo?

949
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,920
Okay,

950
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,240
turn off the lights and
come sleep on the bed.

951
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,040
No no,

952
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,520
I'll sleep here itself.

953
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,600
You think that your purity
will go away by sleeping on the bed?

954
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,760
Now, what do you want?

955
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,840
I want everything,

956
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,920
whatever I have been
giving over these years,

957
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,040
I want all of that.

958
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,360
The child is sleeping
outside, please talk softly.

959
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,720
Only now you realise that
she is sleeping outside?

960
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,240
So many days in her presence,
you've done so many things?

961
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,120
Hey Raji,

962
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,080
come here!

963
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,720
Are you trying to
cause problems?

964
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,520
What is it mom?
What happened?

965
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,600
Nothing sweetheart,
you go sleep.

966
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,280
Go.

967
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,320
Your dad thinks that his purity
will go away by sleeping on the bed.

968
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,680
He seems to say that I'm a different
caste and he is a different caste.

969
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,920
Now, when did I tell
you all that?

970
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,120
Why are you lying to her?

971
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,080
Hey fraud,

972
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,040
if I give you milk you
aren't drinking it,

973
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,600
you're not eating at home.

974
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,280
What are you pretending?

975
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,640
Whatever it is, let's talk
in the morning. Go sleep.

976
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,920
What?

977
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,240
What do you think of yourself?

978
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,360
Fraud!

979
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,480
Get out, man!

980
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,520
You're hitting me is it?

981
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,320
Eating my food and living
in the house that my father bought,

982
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,640
you're hitting me?

983
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,560
Get out, man!

984
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,840
If you stay here even for a
minute in this house,

985
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,800
I'll stab myself with this knife.

986
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,760
Get out, man!

987
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,080
Mom, please don't do it!

988
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,120
Dad, please go outside.

989
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,000
Get out!

990
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,440
Go outside!

991
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,600
You said that it's your
father's house right?

992
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,600
Next time if I come here you can say, dog,
why did you come here?

993
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,880
Eating my food and living
in the house that my father bought,

994
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,560
you're hitting me?

995
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,800
Get out, man!

996
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,840
Fraud!

997
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,360
Get out, man!

998
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,040
It's fine if he did his atrocities
when he had his hair on,

999
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,680
I thought he'd change now after his head
shaved by keeping a ponytail and looking holy,

1000
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,480
but he's turned out to be
even worse than before.

1001
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,960
He brought a fair lady and even got a home,
and that too he caught an NRI person.

1002
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,280
He will never change.

1003
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,120
Searching for him has
become my duty now.

1004
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,880
Has he been sloshed
inside the car?

1005
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,080
Where has he gone?

1006
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,440
Has he committed suicide
or something?

1007
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,480
He's not one that
does these things.

1008
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,680
He'll only do that to others.

1009
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,680
Will the 2 lakhs be
on my head now?

1010
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,600
Sir!

1011
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,880
I had to search for
you everywhere.

1012
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,120
Everyone's searching for you,

1013
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,840
you've also kept your
phone switched off.

1014
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,720
Sir,

1015
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,560
Yazhini madam is also
in search of you.

1016
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,080
You told that you'll be taking
her to the Sri Lankan consulate,

1017
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,400
regarding her son.

1018
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,520
Sir, please come.

1019
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,640
It must surely be Yazhini
madam who's calling me.

1020
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,120
Hello!

1021
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,480
Hello, I'm Yazhini speaking.

1022
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,640
Yes, tell me madam?

1023
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,400
Where are you?

1024
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,280
Sir is sleeping on the steps
by the pond of the Kothandaramar temple.

1025
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,360
Oh you've come is it?

1026
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,640
Please wait, I'll come there.

1027
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,560
Please come, madam.

1028
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,120
See where he's sleeping.

1029
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,560
What happened?

1030
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,840
Why is he sleeping over here?

1031
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,200
Sir's wife is a sub-inspector.

1032
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,240
That lady chased him
out of the house.

1033
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,280
For what?

1034
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,600
Sir's a Brahmin

1035
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,120
that lady is of a
different caste.

1036
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,280
She kept quiet when he wasn't
much into the religion.

1037
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,600
One day,

1038
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,600
when he suddenly came
home with a ponytail,

1039
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,760
she got very pissed and
cut his ponytail off.

1040
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,520
Come!

1041
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,440
I'll stay here, you
bring him and come.

1042
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,280
Okay, madam.

1043
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,280
Sir, Yazhini madam has come.

1044
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,280
Come!

1045
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,600
She's calling you home.

1046
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,680
Please come,

1047
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,920
Sir, this happens in every house.
Now, please come.

1048
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,560
Madam, look how badly she's cut his
ponytail off by causing a wound.

1049
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,560
Oh my, what kind of
a woman is she?

1050
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,640
Sir, please wear your slippers.

1051
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,000
Come sir, let's go.

1052
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,080
Sir, you take madam
and go home.

1053
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,080
I'll take the jeep and
leave it at the police

1054
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,600
station and will come
back and take my bike.

1055
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,440
Okay, sir?

1056
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,120
Please, come.

1057
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,840
The blood's coming out.

1058
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,560
One second, please
don't move.

1059
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,520
I'll be back.

1060
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,320
Relax relax.

1061
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,320
Okay

1062
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,000
Thank you

1063
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,880
I'll get you
something to eat.

1064
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,600
No, thank you.

1065
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,560
Please, wait.

1066
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,880
"What did you do?"

1067
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,520
"What did you do to me?"

1068
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:02,160
"What did you actually do?"

1069
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,720
"What did you do?"

1070
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,560
"What did you actually do?"

1071
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,760
"I don't have the heart
to let you go."

1072
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,960
"You've tied me up to you."

1073
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,440
"I don't have the heart
to let you go."

1074
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:35,120
"You've tied me up to you."

1075
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,560
"What did you do?"

1076
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,400
"What did you do to me?"

1077
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,800
"What did you actually do?"

1078
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:11,120
"I was astonished
to see me in your heart"

1079
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:16,040
"I was spellbound
for the love you've for me"

1080
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,920
"Will lean on your shoulder
when I am worried"

1081
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:26,320
"That will be enough for me
to live my life happily"

1082
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:35,080
"Will become your pet
shower affection on you"

1083
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:44,960
"Will do secret service
to bestow you a baby"

1084
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:51,520
"May you lead a new happy life"

1085
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:56,640
"Will be with you forever and ever"

1086
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,120
"What did you do?"

1087
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,600
"What did you do to me?"

1088
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,880
Women are the weaker sex,

1089
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,840
but they are not
weak in sex.

1090
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,920
Yes,

1091
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,760
I only see you
as my friend.

1092
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,840
I've come in
search of my son.

1093
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,560
Except seeing my son,
nothing will give me happiness.

1094
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,400
He's going to wake up.

1095
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,560
You morons,

1096
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,320
you'll have
stolen my car!

1097
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,920
I started driving the car,
because the video camera was broken

1098
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,560
these thieves have even
taken the car away from me.

1099
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,320
How will I sort
out my debts?

1100
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,760
If my owner gets to know about this,
he'd chase and hit me all the way.

1101
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,880
I couldn't pay back
my old debt,

1102
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,520
that's why I started
driving the car.

1103
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,240
Greetings, madam!

1104
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,440
What is it?

1105
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,560
It seems that there's a file
inside the TV cupboard.

1106
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,720
Sir, told me to bring it and
give it to the writer.

1107
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,640
Where is he?

1108
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,760
He's gone to Andhra for work.

1109
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,600
It's a 3:30 train, madam.

1110
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,840
Wait!

1111
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,440
She's taken it and
is grilling me.

1112
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,640
Mom, move!

1113
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,440
Keep watching TV
all the time.

1114
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,200
Fraud!

1115
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,680
He's made a lease agreement
without me knowing about it.

1116
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,320
Why has he taken this house?

1117
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,560
Hey!

1118
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,520
Tell him to come and
see it himself.

1119
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,480
Okay, madam!

1120
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,000
It's always like this.
I'm stuck here like a little calf.

1121
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,920
I chose to join this profession.

1122
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,240
Hey! Turn off the
TV and leave.

1123
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:13,000
Who are you?

1124
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,000
Mom, those are dad's clothes!

1125
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,560
I'm going on saying and
you're just going inside.

1126
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,840
He's a 420 guy, You're living
together with him is it?

1127
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,000
- I will attack you
- Is it?

1128
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:31,920
Don't beat me

1129
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,360
Raji, get that towel.

1130
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,280
Did you hit police?

1131
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,560
You thought I'll
be scared of you?

1132
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,600
I'm a police!

1133
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,720
Come on!

1134
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,440
Go!

1135
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:53,920
- Go!
- Please leave me.

1136
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,880
Where are you taking me?

1137
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,040
What you're doing isn't right.

1138
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,200
Leave me!

1139
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,760
Go!

1140
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:05,680
Just because you found a man, you'll
start a family with him is it?

1141
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,760
Come on!

1142
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,640
You can't treat
me like this!

1143
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,760
Leave me!

1144
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,560
Come, I'll book you under
a prostitution case.

1145
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,600
They've filed an FIR (First
Information Report) against...

1146
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,600
...you for prostitution and
for also hitting a cop.

1147
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,680
You've been remanded
in prison for 15 days.

1148
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,760
Poor girl! Sister,
looks like they've beat her up nicely.

1149
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,400
Yeah, don't know what crime
she must've committed.

1150
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,360
She looks so innocent.

1151
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,960
Don't judge anybody by their face.

1152
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,160
Who knows?

1153
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,920
She's looks like she's from
a rich background.

1154
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,520
Hey Sumathi!

1155
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,920
That Yazhini lady has been
lying down without eating for 2 days.

1156
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,400
The doctor has asked to bring her there.

1157
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,440
You take her and go.

1158
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,280
Hey dear, wake up!

1159
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:57,080
The warden has asked me
to take you to the doctor.

1160
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,640
Doctor, there were a lot of wounds
in her body on the day she was remanded.

1161
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,440
She's not eating properly,

1162
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,320
she's not cooperating properly and
there are no visitors coming to see her.

1163
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:13,200
Somebody complained to
the Human Rights Commission.

1164
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,280
Take her back to the cell
once the trips are done.

1165
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,640
Yazhini, we must go to court.

1166
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,160
Come, get inside the van.

1167
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,400
"Fear is but foolishness."

1168
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,480
"Courage is a trait of the Dravidians."

1169
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,360
"Whether your death is at 6 or 100,"

1170
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,680
"it is your duty to protect
your motherland."

1171
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:32,000
"it is your duty to protect
your motherland."

1172
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,840
Sir!

1173
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,080
Tell me, dear?

1174
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,120
There's a person I know
that has been arrested.

1175
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:45,560
They aren't giving us a bail.

1176
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,360
Only you can somehow help us
in getting a bail from the high court.

1177
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,640
Please help us, sir.

1178
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,240
It's nothing, don't worry.

1179
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,040
Sir,

1180
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,640
they won't be able to pay
much for the fees.

1181
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,600
That's alright!

1182
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,360
Thank you, sir.

1183
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,240
Hey, don't act too much.

1184
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,680
Yeah, where did you go in
the morning at 3 o'clock?

1185
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,640
- I went to Koyambedu, sir.
- Koyambedu?

1186
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,480
Yes sir,

1187
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,520
there's a client come to
our city from Andhra.

1188
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,480
Hey, give that man.

1189
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,480
What is this man?

1190
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,320
These are old 1000 and 500 rupee
notes that are new.

1191
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,720
His father had been in a coma for 3 years

1192
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,640
and had recently passed away last week.

1193
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,520
When he opened his father's suitcase
he found old notes comprising of 5 lakhs.

1194
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,560
Sir, he's begging you to somehow
change these notes for him.

1195
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,360
How?

1196
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,120
Shall I keep this coat aside
and join your profession?

1197
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,080
Brother, you brought your money and
came here listening to this guy.

1198
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,160
We can't get it changed.

1199
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,560
If you want you can get it
change from Reserve Bank. Go.

1200
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,960
Hey! Give that man.

1201
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,880
I trusted you and came for this.

1202
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,920
Please sit down, Ramarajan.

1203
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,440
Your leg isn't doing well.

1204
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,920
Should I say this every day?

1205
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,480
From now onwards you don't
have to stand up every time.

1206
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,720
Please understand.

1207
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,280
Okay, sir.

1208
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,800
Mohan, Venkatesan

1209
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,840
Petition!

1210
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,440

01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,440
Selva! (Calls out name thrice)

1213
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,120
Did you put up a tender coconut juice shop
and started doing business on the pavement?

1214
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,160
Yes, madam.

1215
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:28,360
You guys bring in people that
sell tender coconut juice on the-

1216
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,560
-pavement or beggars begging on
the main road as petition cases,

1217
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,840
but tend to ignore people that
do burglary, rape and murder.

1218
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,160
Okay, okay, pay a fine
of rupees 150 and leave.

1219
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,840
Okay, sir.

1220
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:40,880
Who's next?

1221
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,480
Rajendran!

1222
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,040
Rajendran! (Calls out name thrice)

1223
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,440
Did you drive the bike
without wearing a helmet?

1224
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,360
Yes, madam.

1225
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,160
Why man?

1226
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,560
To protect your own
life the high court-

1227
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,160
-has given an order to
compulsorily wear a helmet.

1228
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,560
How can you not follow that?

1229
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,800
My parents have been
scolding at me,

1230
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,360
because my hair has been falling
due to wearing the helmet.

1231
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:05,280
Man, your hair isn't important,
only your life is important.

1232
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,040
Don't you want to protect your family?

1233
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,200
Case #10183, Manikyam, Kaarthikesan

1234
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,440
Okay, pay a fine of rupees 250 and leave.

1235
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,360
Okay, madam.

1236
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,960
Remand case, Yazhini!

1237
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,720
Yazhini! (Calls out name thrice)

1238
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,960
Lady, does your family know
that you've been arrested?

1239
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,240
They've made an enquiry with
the State Human Rights Commission.

1240
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,440
That's this case, sir.

1241
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,880
Do you have a lawyer
to handle your case?

1242
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,480
- PP
- Sir?

1243
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,760
Can we refer this case to
the legal aid department?

1244
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,920
We can refer it, sir.

1245
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:48,960
Okay.

1246
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,600
Hey, Velayudham!

1247
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,320
Yes, sir?

1248
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,200
Is your senior there or has
he gone to the 12 O'clock show?

1249
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,160
He's there, sir.

1250
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,240
Tell him to come here.

1251
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,080
You don't worry about anything.

1252
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,200
You're from my hometown as well.

1253
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:02,720
Yes sir.

1254
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,920
I'll talk to the Superintendent of Police
and get you a transfer.

1255
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,000
- Okay, sir.
- Brother?

1256
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:06,760
Yes, sir?

1257
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
- Take good care of your mother.
- Yeah, okay sir.

1258
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,200
Sir is calling you.

1259
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,640
What did you do?

1260
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:16,960
I didn't do anything.

1261
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,240
Please come in, Mr. Govindhan.

1262
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,200
You must assist the court, Mr. Govindhan.

1263
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,920
As you please your honour!

1264
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,600
Give him the case file, dear.

1265
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,680
Sir, along with the FIR,
all the papers are inside the file.

1266
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,040
I feel like there's something
wrong with this case.

1267
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:49,440
That's why I called Govindhan and
gave it to him to make it right.

1268
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,800
Okay, what's the next case?

1269
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,200
- Lady, who are you?
- I'm a police constable.

1270
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,720
She won't runaway anywhere,
please stand in the corner.

1271
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,920
Why have you not applied for a bail?

1272
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,040
He smells bad.

1273
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,160
I think he's a drunkard.

1274
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,600
Sorry, it's because of
yesterday's hangover.

1275
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,160
You don't have a relative in Chennai?

1276
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,880
Hello, answer me!

1277
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,320
The court wants to help you.

1278
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,560
I don't have anyone here.

1279
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,000
Oh! You're Tamil is it?

1280
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,160
I was born in Sri Lanka...

1281
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,000
Okay, come.

1282
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:55,760
Velayudham

1283
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,760
They've put a false case on this lady.

1284
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,160
Mahendran will be there in the
chamber, go send a bail petition.

1285
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,800
Okay brother, I'll get it ready.

1286
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,000
Sir?

1287
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,320
Mahendran sir! Sir has
asked you to get a bail...

1288
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,040
...petition for this FIR and
a surety bond ready.

1289
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,600
This is the bail application.

1290
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,440
I'll give her a surety myself.

1291
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,840
Sir, the bail application and
the surety bond are all there.

1292
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,120
She doesn't have any relative in India.

1293
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,480
How was it?

1294
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,800
She should put her signature for 10 days.

1295
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,040
Condition bail is granted.

1296
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:03,800
I'm obliged your honour!

1297
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,120
- Mr. Govindhan!
- Your honour?

1298
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,160
You've got this under your personal surety,

1299
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,840
- So be careful.
- Yes, your honour!

1300
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,000
- Velayudham!
- Yes, sir?

1301
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,960
You too must be careful.

1302
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,640
Okay, sir.

1303
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,960
Or else we'll throw you in jail.

1304
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,880
Please, come.

1305
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,840
Actually this is a very peculiar case.

1306
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,200
Since a cop has given
a complaint against you,

1307
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,480
I had to give you a surety myself,

1308
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,880
as you don't even have any relation here.

1309
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,680
Sir, they've asked her
to put a signature daily.

1310
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,400
- How many days should she do it?
- It's only for 10 days.

1311
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,720
You do remember the
house you were living in right?

1312
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,520
Kaatha lingam, Murali

1313
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,280
What man?

1314
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,920
You please sit behind.

1315
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,440
Hey, you sit in front.

1316
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,080
Velayudham, you saw the house right?

1317
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,560
I want all the details tomorrow in the
morning, only then we can proceed further.

1318
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,400
This is my house!

1319
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,800
Until we find your documents,
you've got to adjust yourself here.

1320
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,880
This is my office,

1321
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,760
There's a small room right next to it.

1322
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,160
You can stay there.

1323
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,120
Okay?

1324
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,680
You please go inside.

1325
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:23,880
Hey, Velayudham

1326
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,240
Take her and go with you.

1327
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,680
And also give her something to eat.

1328
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,760
Please come, madam.

1329
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,320
This is his house

1330
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,680
This door will always be closed,
so you won't have a problem.

1331
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,080
Yeah, tell me.

1332
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,000
Yes, I read the case file.

1333
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:47,840
No problem.

1334
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,200
Yeah, that's not a big deal,
we can get it solved.

1335
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,680
It's just a small case.
No problem

1336
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,440
They are increasing the
sugar value in Ration shop

1337
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,040
I know the person from the other
side, so we can get it done.

1338
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,400
No problem, don't worry,
our people will be there.

1339
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,880
You don't have to worry about anything.

1340
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,880
We can file a petition.
No problem

1341
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:02,680
Okay

1342
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:04,560
Done sir

1343
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,760
Thank you

1344
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,320
Thank you so much.

1345
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,160
Please come and be seated.

1346
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,760
Hey man!

1347
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,480
What is it?

1348
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,040
Advocate Jothi sir, sent us here.

1349
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,960
We want to file a writ petition.

1350
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:19,840
Why?

1351
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,080
They aren't letting us write our exams
due to the lack of our attendance.

1352
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:22,640
Why?

1353
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:23,920
Where did you go, bunking college?

1354
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,080
Sir, we didn't bunk college.

1355
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,240
We weren't well, that's why.

1356
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,840
Why didn't you give them
a medical certificate?

1357
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,200
We gave it to them sir, but
they aren't taking it.

1358
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,120
Okay,

1359
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,480
I'll talk to Jothi whether
we should file a writ or not.

1360
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,120
Okay, sir.

1361
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:41,360
- You may leave
- Okay sir.

1362
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,920
- We'll take your leave sir.
- Okay.

1363
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,000
Hey, did you buy the drinks?

1364
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,880
- What man?
- Sir

1365
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,560
I have to give a party in
the evening, that's why.

1366
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:50,920
Come here,

1367
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,120
Come closer man

1368
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,480
Very good!

1369
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,520
Go close the screen.

1370
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,400
Okay, sir.

1371
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,720
Come, let's go on upstairs.

1372
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,280
Everything's ready,

1373
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,440
we must only start now.

1374
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:11,600
Yeah,

1375
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,040
Did you go to your native place
to meet your mom and dad?

1376
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,000
Did you go to your native place
to meet your mom and dad?

1377
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,080
Yes sir, I met them.

1378
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,320
Drink!

1379
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,200
Give, give, give!

1380
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:55,760
You went to meet your parents,
then why did you go to my house?

1381
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,040
Wait, wait, wait!

1382
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,280
You, come here.

1383
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,240
You went to meet your parents,
then why did you go to my house?

1384
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,440
- Hey!
- Brother

1385
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,440
- Don't drink too much.
- I'm drinking too much is it?

1386
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,080
I'm drinking too much is it?

1387
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,120
What did you say?

1388
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,320
I told you not to drink too much.

1389
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,840
You know how my mom scolded me right?

1390
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,280
You know it right?

1391
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:53,480
Then why did you go there knowing that?

1392
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,760
This is your last chance.

1393
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,480
If you go there again then go stay there.

1394
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,320
Understood?

1395
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,720
- Okay, brother.
- Take it.

1396
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:07,360
Now, take all this and go

1397
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:14,840
Go!

1398
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,680
Hey!

1399
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,240
Hey!

1400
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,680
Velayudham!

1401
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,680
Velayudham!

1402
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,720
Here, give him some water.

1403
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,480
Brother?

1404
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,160
Brother?
What happened to you?

1405
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,760
Careful!

1406
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,640
- Brother, drink some water.
- Slowly!

1407
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,040
He drank raw alcohol.

1408
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,240
Drink some water.

1409
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,760
Why are you guys drinking like this?

1410
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:23,120
(Song from 'Vasantha Maligai')

1411
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,760
You hold him.
We'll make him sleep straight.

1412
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,800
(Coughs...)

1413
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,440
Brother, why are you thinking of
your mother and drinking like this?

1414
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,120
I'm trying so hard to
make you understand,

1415
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,640
but you aren't listening to me.

1416
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,240
You go sleep.

1417
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,920
(Song from 'Aval Oru Thodar Kathai')

1418
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:58,960
Madam!

1419
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,080
Did you give it to him?

1420
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,520
Yeah, I gave it to him, madam.

1421
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,560
Do you guys usually have a bath
in the roadside bathroom?

1422
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:20,200
No madam,

1423
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,600
we usually have a bath
in our house bathroom,

1424
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,440
but since you're staying here,
we're using the public bathroom.

1425
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,320
Hey! We must be in
court at 10:30.

1426
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,520
- Lock it soon.
- Okay brother.

1427
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,720
You please sit.

1428
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,880
There's going to be a big
party in the evening.

1429
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,280
If you see and do something
then it'll be nice.

1430
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,720
Madam's coming.

1431
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,000
Hello.

1432
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,560
Will you go by auto?

1433
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,920
Yeah, I'll catch an auto
and come straight there.

1434
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,560
- Do you have change?
- Yes I do.

1435
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:04,040
Brother!

1436
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,000
Hey! Lift her up!

1437
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,360
Lift her!

1438
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,280
Case #1466 Father Venkatesan

1439
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,560
Take that vehicle.

1440
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:38,000
Get in!

1441
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,400
Hello!

1442
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,520
Hey,

1443
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,920
Who are you man?

1444
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:00,400
You're talking on the
phone like a woman.

1445
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,480
If you have the guts,
come meet me directly.

1446
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,560
Hey, what man?

1447
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,360
Just because she's fair,
you brought with you is it?

1448
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,480
She also isn't wearing
anything on her neck.

1449
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,400
Hey! If you talk anything
bad about that woman,

1450
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:08,600
I'll cut you to pieces.

1451
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,840
Which area are you from, man?
Where are you?

1452
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,440
Who is it, brother?

1453
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,720
Hey! Go man.

1454
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,400
Who must that be?

1455
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,200
What happened?

1456
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,920
Who is he fighting with?

1457
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,760
Someone on the phone has spoken
something bad about you.

1458
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,600
That's why brother seems so tensed.

1459
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,360
Hey, Velayudham!

1460
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,320
- Come here, man!
- Yeah, I'm coming brother.

1461
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:58,960
Sister

1462
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:05,000
What are you doing
here without sleeping?

1463
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,640
I'm not feeling good.

1464
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,240
I feel very confused.

1465
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,400
I'm filled with the thoughts of my son.

1466
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,560
You came to brother for help.

1467
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,400
He'll take care of everything from now.

1468
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,400
You don't have to worry about anything.

1469
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:27,440
Brother gave an earful to the guy
who spoke badly about you

1470
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:32,840
Today in the afternoon that he called
in the evening and apologized for it.

1471
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,600
You be brave.

1472
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,640
Oh I totally forgot!

1473
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,520
Brother had asked me to give this to you.

1474
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,800
Why do I need all this?

1475
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,200
Please don't get me wrong.

1476
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,800
If he's giving you the chain that
he had bought for his mother,

1477
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,840
it means that he has so
much respect for you.

1478
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:58,880
Don't leave your neck bare

1479
01:27:58,920 --> 01:27:59,960
Wear it on.

1480
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:05,720
Wear it on!

(Song from 'En Annan')

1482
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,400
Sister, please wear it on,

1483
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,600
Else, he will scold me

1484
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,960
Hey! What are you
talking stories?

1485
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,680
- Did you give it to her?
- Yes brother, I gave it to her.

1486
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,280
Here Velayudham,

1487
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,360
give him water if he starts vomiting.

1488
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,680
Hey! Am I vomiting daily?

1489
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,720
Yeah, he's only daily cursing his mother.

1490
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,520
(Song from 'Karnan')

1491
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,680
- Sir, I'm advocate Govindhan.
- Yes.

1492
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,640
Please be seated.

1493
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,040
Sit down.

1494
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,400
What can I do for you?

1495
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:01,760
Do you know her?

1496
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,800
Yes, I do know her.

1497
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,280
She was referred by
inspector Ragavachari,

1498
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,920
so she came here to open an account.

1499
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,080
Do you remember the one
who came here with her?

1500
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:10,840
It was constable that came with her.

1501
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:15,640
Sir, if you don't mind,

1502
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,960
can I get the CCTV
footage of that date?

1503
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,200
Oh sure!

1504
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:20,960
I'll arrange it and call you.

1505
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:21,840
Thank you, sir.

1506
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,000
Welcome, sir.

1507
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,480
Please wait, I'll be back soon.

1508
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,360
Madam, who do you need to see?

1509
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,720
I need to see the manager.

1510
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:34,520
Please wait a minute.

1511
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,840
My name is Yazhini.

1512
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,120
Hello

1513
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:40,200
Sir, there's a lady named
Yazhini, who's come to see you.

1514
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,240
Send her inside.

1515
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,440
Okay, sir.

1516
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,240
- You can go inside, madam.
- Thank you!

1517
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:48,640
- Hello sir!
- Hello!

1518
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,880
- You remember me?
- Yes, yes,

1519
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,920
You're a Malaysian return,

1520
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:51,360
I know.

1521
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,840
I've transferred 8 lakhs to your account.

1522
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,200
I remember you.

1523
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,040
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

1524
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,480
Please come

1525
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,200
Sit.

1526
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,120
Brother?

1527
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,040
Brother?

1528
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,440
Brother?

1529
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:45,520
What man?

1530
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:46,640
Just give us a minute.

1531
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:48,400
He's our client.

1532
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:49,040
What man?

1533
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,680
Sir, they're calling me
to the police station.

1534
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:51,720
Then go.

1535
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,320
I'm scared that they'd
imprison me if I go.

1536
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,800
You should have thought about it
yesterday at night,

1537
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,280
before you drank and hit a cop.

1538
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,680
Sir, when I was drunk
he wasn't wearing his uniform

1539
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:02,800
That's why I did that.

1540
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,200
If you want I'll ask him to
wear his uniform and come,

1541
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,080
do you want to hit him again?

1542
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,160
Go man!

1543
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,280
Hey, I need to file at
4 O'clock in court.

1544
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,120
Don't irritate me,

1545
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,200
- Just go away.
- Okay, brother.

1546
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:11,920
Take him and go.

1547
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:13,000
Hey! Come here, man.

1548
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,080
- Do something, brother.
- Go man.

1549
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,160
I don't know what to do, man.

1550
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:18,600
I'm going to get beaten wherever I go.

1551
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,040
Yeah, Point,

1552
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,440
your senior never drinks is it?

1553
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:22,240
He won't drink now.

1554
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:23,840
- Then?
- Only in the evening,

1555
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,480
come after 6 with a
full bottle of alcohol.

1556
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,840
Oh, okay then.

1557
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,160
I'll come in the evening with
a full bottle of alcohol.

1558
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,840
- Do something, man.
- Okay.

1559
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:32,320
I only have my trust in you.

1560
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,800
Call her.

1561
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,800
Sister!

1562
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,000
Sister!

1563
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,520
Brother is calling you.

1564
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,120
- Please, sit.
- Greetings sister!

1565
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,560
Hey, take out the
high court document.

1566
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,000
Please put your signature in this.

1567
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,920
We must take a print out,
check if the shop is opened.

1568
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,080
Okay, brother.

1569
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:20,000
You've got yourself trapped
by signing like this.

1570
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,920
You want ask why should you sign this?

1571
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:23,240
Why?

1572
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,240
I've filed a cause petition stating
that the FIR filed against you is wrong,

1573
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,640
so this is the document for
me to appear in court.

1574
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,440
Yeah, where were you
staying in Rameswaram?

1575
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,760
SS residency!

1576
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,560
SS residency

1577
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,520
Do you have the hotel's number?

1578
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,560
No!

1579
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,680
Yes! Got it!

1580
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,880
- Hello!
- Tell me?

1581
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,800
- Is this SS residency?
- Yes!

1582
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:04,000
Last month there was a person named
Yazhini who stayed over there,

1583
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:05,080
I need her details.

1584
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,240
Who are you?

1585
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,400
Sir, I'm advocate Govindhan.

1586
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,000
I'm practicing in high court.

1587
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,840
Why do you need our customer details?

1588
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,680
Sir, Yazhini is with me now.

1589
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,440
She has misplaced her passport.

1590
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:17,960
While staying at your hotel,

1591
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,560
she must've given a Xerox copy
of her passport for ID proof.

1592
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,320
Can you send me that
Xerox copy on WhatsApp?

1593
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,720
Okay sir, I'll do it.

1594
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,400
Thank you, sir.

1595
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:26,960
Okay.

1596
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:31,120
Brother, the shop is opened.

1597
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,080
Take this pen-drive and get a print out.

1598
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,200
Okay.

1599
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:37,200
You please leave.

1600
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,080
Brother, I set the section.

1601
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:54,360
Sister's case will surely
be listed tomorrow.

1602
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,160
It's come on top of the list.

1603
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:58,280
Hello!

1604
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:18,920
Keep this.

1605
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,520
The matter has reached.

1606
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,240
In case the judge asks you anything,

1607
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,440
speak boldly.

1608
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:50,320
Item number 112 quash petition,

1609
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:53,080
criminal OP of 6742 of 2018,

1610
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,000
Govindhan public prosecutor.

1611
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:58,440
- May I please my lord?
- Yes!

1612
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:01,040
A petition to quash the FIR.

1613
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,800
You know I don't entertain
quash petitions in my court.

1614
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,560
Mr. Govindhan?

1615
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,360
What do you find so wrong with this FIR?

1616
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,520
My lord!

1617
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,480
The petitioner has come from Malaysia.

1618
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,440
Wait!

1619
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:17,800
I'll study the papers.

1620
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:27,520
You say that you have evidence to show
that she landed in the Madurai airport.

1621
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,200
Where is it?

1622
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,800
My lord! It is at page
number 10 of the typeset.

1623
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:42,840
PP, what's happening
in our state?

1624
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:43,760
Huh!

1625
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,320
I seriously want to know.

1626
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,960
You people just arrest anybody you want,
file an FIR and put them in prison is it?

1627
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:49,600
Huh!

1628
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,880
What's all this?

1629
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:51,840
My lord!

1630
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:55,040
The petitioner has abused and
hurt a lady sub-inspector...

1631
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:57,320
and is also involved in prostitution.

1632
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:02,480
They've cheated her with 8 lakhs.

1633
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,680
All the documentation is clear,

1634
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,360
that she landed in Madurai and that
she's come from Malaysia.

1635
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:10,560
What more do you need?

1636
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,720
I didn't get instructions.

1637
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,560
Don't try those stories with me.

1638
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:14,800
Come on take down

1639
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,920
First the department
should conduct an enquiry...

1640
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,600
against the concerned
police officers,

1641
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:21,520
take suitable action and
report the same to me.

1642
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:25,040
There's a Tamil woman who's come
in search of her child from Malaysia

1643
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,520
These police officers have
been cheating on her.

1644
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,880
I want immediate action.

1645
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,720
Matter posted next week 250.

1646
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,120
Call the next item.

1647
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,480
You argued very well,

1648
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,560
Thanks a lot.

1649
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:37,800
More than me arguing,

1650
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,920
it was because the judge himself knew
that it's a genuine case,

1651
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,320
why he gave the order.

1652
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:52,720
Hello!

1653
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:53,400
Sir!

1654
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,280
- Is this advocate Govindhan sir?
- Yes, tell me?

1655
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:56,600
I'm Thangadurai speaking,

1656
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,320
Yazhini's husband's friend.

1657
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:02,200
I was also in search of Yazhini's son
and later withdrew from it.

1658
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:05,000
Brother, do you know any
details about the child?

1659
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,000
Where are you now?

1660
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:08,520
Sir, I already told you.

1661
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,320
Please give the phone to Yazhini.

1662
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,320
Please.

1663
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,800
Wait for 10 minutes

1664
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,360
Yazhini will speak with you.

1665
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,240
- What happened?
- It's getting cut.

1666
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,840
I don't know why he's cutting the call.

1667
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,120
- Hello!
- I'm Thangadurai speaking,

1668
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,120
Give the phone to Yazhini.

1669
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:46,000
One minute, here speak to him.

1670
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,600
Hello!

1671
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,040
I'm Yazhini speaking.

1672
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,360
Thangadurai, how are you?

1673
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:52,880
And where are you?

1674
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:54,520
Where's my son?

1675
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,040
I've come to Sri Lanka

1676
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,520
Your son is here.

1677
01:37:58,720 --> 01:37:59,480
Please,

1678
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,320
I need to speak to my son right now,

1679
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,080
give the phone to him.

1680
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:04,200
You can't talk to him like
that whenever you want.

1681
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:05,000
Is he fine?

1682
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:05,960
He's fine.

1683
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:07,400
What's the name of my son?

1684
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:08,440
I can't say all that now.

1685
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,000
The child isn't next to me right now.

1686
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:11,960
I'll call you later.

1687
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,280
Relax!

1688
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,360
Don't get tensed.

1689
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,320
Now you got to know
where your son is right.

1690
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,520
Yeah, you know that
Thangadurai right?

1691
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,560
Yes

1692
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,000
Then he'll surely call you back.

1693
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,440
Hey, come fast.

1694
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,640
The guy who called in
the morning is on Skype.

1695
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,600
Thangadurai is it?

1696
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:53,560
Is this he?

1697
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,960
Thangadurai, where is my son?

1698
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:59,200
Tell me Thangadurai?

1699
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,560
Why did you tell Dr. Meenakshi
to lie to me about my son?

1700
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:09,120
For the state that you were in,
I didn't want you to worry about your son.

1701
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,680
That's why I told the doctor not
to tell you about your son.

1702
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:13,840
He's Fine.

1703
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,080
It wouldn't have been nice.

1704
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,840
What's the name of my son?

1705
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:21,640
Balasingam.

1706
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:25,040
Ask him to speak to me.

1707
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,600
I will tell him to speak to you.

1708
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,760
Mother, are you fine?

1709
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,280
I can only hear your voice,

1710
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:36,360
but I'm not able to see you.

1711
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:38,360
Mother, you look beautiful.

1712
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,840
But I'm unable to see how you look.

1713
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,880
What are you studying now?

1714
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,600
I'm learning about social war

1715
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,640
Everybody keeps praising me
in the NGO for my social services.

1716
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:53,960
Balasingam, I've always
lived in loneliness.

1717
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:58,320
At least from now onwards
I wish to be with you.

1718
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,200
Why do you need to do such
social services at this age?

1719
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,160
There are children younger to me
who are eager as well.

1720
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,600
I won't leave you alone, mother.

1721
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,320
It seems that we have a nation for
ourselves with Tamil as our mother tongue.

1722
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,320
You come take me and go with you.

1723
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:14,560
I wish to see how you look just for once.

1724
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:17,880
Everybody says that I will look like this.

1725
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,520
I thought that only I am a big activist,

1726
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:28,720
but your son is really great.

1727
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,200
Born to prove!

1728
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,840
I'll post the matter for mediation.

1729
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,200
First ask them to give the money back

1730
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,720
Then I'll ask them to
withdraw the complaint...

1731
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:42,520
and will then quash the FIR.

1732
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,080
What Mr. Govindhan, do you
accept this agreement?

1733
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:46,640
Do you accept this Compromise?

1734
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:53,000
Sister, advocate sir has asked me to
take you to advocate Sujatha's office.

1735
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:54,760
Be ready

1736
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,400
I'll be there now.

1737
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,480
Okay, sister.

1738
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,480
- She'll agree to it.
- Yeah, let's see.

1739
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,880
Yeah, come in madam.

1740
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:05,320
Madam has come.

1741
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:06,720
Hello ma'am!

1742
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:07,720
I'm Yazhini.

1743
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,000
Hi! I'm advocate Sujatha.

1744
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,280
She too had just come in now.

1745
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,760
Please be seated.

1746
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:13,520
You please wait outside.

1747
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,040
Please forgive me,

1748
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,680
I made a mistake.

1749
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,880
Don't get excited about anything.

1750
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,480
We'll talk and sort it out.

1751
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:29,600
Arresting you straight away
without thinking was my fault.

1752
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,760
Forgive me.

1753
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,480
It's okay.

1754
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,080
I've applied for a divorce in court.

1755
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:40,520
Living with him for so many
years is a big deal.

1756
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,240
He'll do anything for money.

1757
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,520
I feel so bad that
they've suspended us

1758
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,280
But he isn't even bothered about it.

1759
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:53,720
You both fell in love and
then got married right?

1760
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,400
He's a Brahmin

1761
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:56,920
I'm a Non-Brahmin.

1762
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,160
His house is right next to mine.

1763
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,400
I've been cheated.

1764
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,040
I've learnt a good lesson.

1765
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:07,640
In these 8 years there's not a
fraudulent work he hasn't done.

1766
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,560
I only kept bearing up with
him for my daughter.

1767
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:16,160
When I met him in Rameswaram,
I thought that he's a very good man.

1768
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,200
He keeps cheating all the
girls with that look.

1769
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,040
Govindhan is my classmate.

1770
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:23,920
He will take care of you properly.

1771
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,760
If you say that
you've excused them,

1772
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,480
then they will remove
the suspension.

1773
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:31,960
What for that?

1774
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,520
I'll ask the advocate
to make a compromise.

1775
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:39,920
Please return all of her things,
including the DD and passport.

1776
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,360
Your other things are
outside in the bag.

1777
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,680
You can go and collect them.

1778
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,600
Hmmm.

1779
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:47,360
This is your things

1780
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,560
Thank you!

1781
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:54,720
Excuse me,

1782
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,880
- You please wait outside.
- Okay madam.

1783
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,400
I need to speak personally with her.

1784
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,600
Okay, bye.

1785
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:01,520
Brother?

1786
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,000
Yes brother!

1787
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,200
Yes,I brought madam here.

1788
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,560
She's inside advocate
Sujatha madam's office.

1789
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,480
Yeah!

1790
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,760
Yes she's come and the sub-inspector
madam too has come.

1791
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,040
They've given her bag to me,

1792
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,160
I only have it.

1793
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:14,840
Yeah they're talking inside.

1794
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,960
I'll bring her once it's done.

1795
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:17,880
Okay, brother.

1796
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,160
Govindhan told me

1797
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:21,880
that you've come in search of your son.

1798
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,240
For your good heart,
soon you will find him.

1799
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,920
You take Govindhan to Sri Lanka.

1800
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,440
He'll be very helpful for you.

1801
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,440
He's not like any other person.

1802
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,600
- Thank you.
- You're in safe hands.

1803
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:35,840
Thank you.

1804
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,920
- Velayudham!
- Yes, sister?

1805
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,600
Every time after drinking,

1806
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:55,480
he keeps thinking and
crying about his mother.

1807
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:58,920
Is there some fight going on
with him and his mother?

1808
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,520
It's nothing like that, sister.

1809
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:03,680
He loves his mother a lot.

1810
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,400
When he became a lawyer,

1811
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:08,160
we kept a celebration for
him in his hometown.

1812
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,520
'R.Thiyagarajan B.A. BL.,
Advocate'

1813
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:11,960
Come, lawyer sir

1814
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:14,920
Please remove your shoes and come.

1815
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:16,840
Yeah, okay sir.

1816
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,760
Is it the new age generation?

1817
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:20,600
Greetings, sir!

1818
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:21,640
Please come.

1819
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:26,000
- Greetings!
- Greetings, sir!

1820
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,080
Hello Mr. Govindhan!

1821
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,080
It looks like you've been
enrolled as an advocate.

1822
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:30,960
Oh sorry!

1823
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,880
Sir, it looks like you've been enrolled.

1824
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
What Boss?

1825
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:35,440
He's the boy who grew up seeing you

1826
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,520
You're newly giving him so much respect.

1827
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,320
The respect is not for your son,

1828
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,880
but for his education.

1829
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,960
I'm happy in one way.

1830
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,040
I don't have to run to
the court in a hurry.

1831
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,760
You'll take care of everything right?

1832
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,240
What are you thinking about, son?

1833
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,160
You're not going to join our office is it?

1834
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:53,800
Sir, I want to practice in High court.

1835
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,120
Very good!

1836
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,520
If you want I'll ask my friends
to recommend for you.

1837
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,640
No sir, all my friends and
I are planning to practice individually.

1838
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:04,680
Your son is intelligent.

1839
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,960
He's fearlessly taken a decision...

1840
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,960
that I should I have taken
when I was younger.

1841
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:12,480
You'll even take care of
my high court cases right?

1842
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,760
Okay, sir.

1843
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:16,640
Sir, the people of this
town are wanting to keep...

1844
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:19,960
a celebration for my son
for becoming a lawyer.

1845
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,800
You should surely come and
take part with your family.

1846
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:24,520
I'll surely come with my family.

1847
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,480
- I'll take your leave.
- Thank you so much, sir.

1848
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:28,560
What Akhila?

1849
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:30,880
You told that you'll finish
your work soon and go home.

1850
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,160
My son has come.

1851
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,120
I must also cook.

1852
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,880
They've gone on top to call sir.

1853
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,080
- Oh! Is it?
- Yeah.

1854
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:37,000
Okay, okay.

1855
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,160
Greetings, madam!

1856
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:38,880
Greetings!

1857
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,280
- How are you?
- I'm doing well.

1858
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:43,080
I've invited sir for the
celebration of our Govindhan,

1859
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:46,440
hosted by his friends
for becoming a lawyer.

1860
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,040
You too must surely come.

1861
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:49,040
Yeah, I will come.

1862
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,320
It seems that your daughter
has come from Chennai?

1863
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,720
Yeah, Gayathri!

1864
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:55,960
Greetings, little madam!

1865
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:56,800
- Greetings!
- How are you?

1866
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:57,880
I'm doing well

1867
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:01,520
Bring her along with you for
the celebration tomorrow in the evening.

1868
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:02,880
Okay.

1869
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:09,560
What man, will all of them come?

1870
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,360
- Yeah, I told them brother.
- Okay, okay.

1871
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,840
Mother, what dress is this?

1872
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,840
If I want to buy you a
new dress you say no to it.

1873
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:16,800
That's okay, dear.

1874
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,440
First you start earning well,

1875
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:19,880
that's enough for me.

1876
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,000
Mother, once I earn well,

1877
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,520
I will get you a gold chain.

1878
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,080
You can wear that and show off
by roaming the whole town.

1879
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:25,920
I'm very happy.

1880
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,920
Okay dear, if lawyer
sir says that he'll come,

1881
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,440
then he'll
correctly come on time.

1882
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:30,200
Let's all go.

1883
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:31,360
Okay, father.

1884
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,760
Greetings to everyone!

1885
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,760
My evening greetings to
everyone who has come here.

1886
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,640
My friend Govindhan,
has become a lawyer

1887
01:46:40,680 --> 01:46:42,560
so we have kept a celebration for him,

1888
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:44,280
Everybody please give him an applause.

1889
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:49,760
If any problem comes in the area,
we will surely praise him.

1890
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,480
All are support goes to Govindhan.

1891
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,360
That's enough of talking.

1892
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,440
Go put the garland on him.

1893
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,720
Go man, go.

1894
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,160
Give him an applause.

1895
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:11,160
This garland will be better suitable
on the father who had brought him up.

1896
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:20,840
Next advocate R. Thyagarajan
will speak on the stage.

1897
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:26,880
See how well he has
brought up his son.

1898
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,800
Even if I ask him to sit down,
he isn't sitting.

1899
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:31,080
Tomorrow when he
becomes a big judge,

1900
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:34,520
I'd have to argue by
standing in front of him.

1901
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:42,840
I congratulate him to gently
grow and see many victories.

1902
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:44,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1903
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:50,600
So many days brother Govindhan
who used to dance with us,

1904
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,720
has become a lawyer by
completing his B.A., B.L., degree.

1905
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:54,520
I don't know if he'd
dance with us anymore

1906
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:57,320
So finally please come
and dance with us brother.

1907
01:47:58,200 --> 01:47:59,360
What say guys?

1908
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:07,040
"We are very smart cookies
Applaud and scream aloud"

1909
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:09,760
"Move aside
Quit staring at us"

1910
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,160
"Not tens or hundreds..."

1911
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,800
"We have millions of followers"

1912
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:17,080
"Open your eyes wide"

1913
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,480
"Give a wink again"

1914
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,440
"Don't be like a fool
Let's go"

1915
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:24,840
"Don't blabber
Is it so?"

1916
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,040
"Don't dare"

1917
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:30,240
"And get thrashed unnecessarily"

1918
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:34,760
"Let us move on teasing each other"

1919
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:35,760
"Go on"

1920
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:38,320
"We are very smart cookies
Applaud and scream aloud"

1921
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:40,280
"Move aside
Quit staring at us"

1922
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,960
"Not tens or hundreds..."

1923
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,200
"We have millions of followers"

1924
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,640
"Listen carefully
what we are telling to you"

1925
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:50,320
"We are local guys, you bet"

1926
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:52,960
"We mix-up and come with a hit song"

1927
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,800
"Always you get fans applause for sure"

1928
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:57,920
"The path you travelled
was very difficult"

1929
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:00,600
"But it was filled with fun and joy"

1930
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:05,880
"We are level different
when if friends are disturbed"

1931
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,760
"Completed our enrolment"

1932
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,240
"Tie the banner
standing on the wood"

1933
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,760
"Put the garland with sandalwood"

1934
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,440
"Cut the cake at the eve party"

1935
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:21,480
"We ask to play the drums
Will rock with dance and sing"

1936
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:26,520
"All of our friends greets wishes
and spends money lavishly"

1937
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:30,800
"For a social cause to defend
we turn to be a lawyer, you know"

1938
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:31,800
"Superb, dude"

1939
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:35,720
"Youth together will raise our voice
and fight for our rights"

1940
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,000
"Well said"

1941
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:41,760
"You politicians, don't dare
to give trouble to us, you bet"

1942
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:46,800
"We'll follow the law and order
and pounce on you, mind it"

1943
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:52,280
"No limits for tussles
But dare not confront us"

1944
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:57,200
"Let us live our lives
majestically and peacefully"

1945
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,560
"Open your eyes wide"

1946
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:02,240
"Give a wink again"

1947
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:04,880
"Don't be like a fool
Let's go"

1948
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:07,480
"Don't blabber
Is it so?"

1949
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:10,040
"Be always happy and enjoy the fun"

1950
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:12,640
"Kick and smash whoever cross your path"

1951
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:15,160
"Tally your life perfectly"

1952
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,720
"Give a call if you face the trouble"

1953
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:20,560
"Be always happy and enjoy the fun
Smash whoever cross your path"

1954
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:23,040
"Tally your life perfectly
Give a call if you face the trouble"

1955
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,600
"Let's go"

1956
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:48,720
You didn't bring her up properly.

1957
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:49,880
What to say?

1958
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:54,400
Mom, why did you scream at me without
any decency in front of everybody?

1959
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,640
You told that I was dancing without wearing
a dress in front of my friends.

1960
01:50:56,680 --> 01:50:58,000
What will my friends think of me?

1961
01:50:58,040 --> 01:50:59,760
Why are you sitting like a statue?

1962
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:01,200
Look at what she's saying.

1963
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,440
Now what did I do so wrong
that you're screaming at me for?

1964
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:05,680
Every time you keep proving
that you're uneducated.

1965
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:07,680
Yes lady, I'm uneducated.

1966
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:11,960
That's why I married a man who's 15
years older to me and running a family.

1967
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:13,440
Now, what are you trying to say?

1968
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:15,760
You were talking for so long,

1969
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:18,160
why aren't you saying
anything when she's here?

1970
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:19,880
She's brought disgrace to the family.

1971
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:24,880
Before she runs away with anybody,
stop her studies and get her married,

1972
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,480
because she needs the company of a man.

1973
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:33,600
She's an educated girl

1974
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:35,160
And her friends are with her.

1975
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,880
Why did you have to speak like that?

1976
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:40,440
I only spoke about what you said.

1977
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,200
You said that I didn't
bring her up properly.

1978
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,960
Okay, but for that you'll
speak like this is it?

1979
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,720
Okay, okay, you go console
her and call her to eat.

1980
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:52,400
What is this?

1981
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,640
Where are you all going?

1982
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,400
What is happening here?

1983
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,720
I didn't think
that our son would do like this

1984
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:02,560
Givindhan showed your ancestry attitude

1985
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,640
I felt ashamed in front of the lawyer

1986
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,280
What man, the function went well right?

1987
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,520
It was great, brother.

1988
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:11,040
Yeah, why did the two of you
come back without eating?

1989
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:15,640
Even though your father's a cobbler,
he had his own respect.

1990
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:16,880
Now, what happened?

1991
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:19,120
Your father's heart is very broken.

1992
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,800
I've never see him like this.

1993
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,240
Why did you do like this?

1994
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:24,440
Mom, now what has happened that
you're speaking like this?

1995
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:25,440
Nothing happened

1996
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,920
When you were carrying
advocate sir's daughter...

1997
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:29,080
and dancing with her without
knowing your status,

1998
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:31,160
I couldn't see their faces.

1999
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,160
You've disgraced us nicely.

2000
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:35,360
Mother, you're talking like
I willfully danced like that.

2001
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:37,080
That girl came by herself and
started dancing with me.

2002
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:38,360
And what is that status?

2003
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,080
It's nothing, son.

2004
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:39,960
Just know about one thing, mother.

2005
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,760
In this world everybody's equal.

2006
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:43,280
I told you right?

2007
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:45,720
Ever since he started studying law,
his behaviour has been changed.

2008
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,120
He says that everyone's equal.

2009
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:49,880
If that lawyer sir wasn't there for
us, we won't be having anything,

2010
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,360
Including this house.

2011
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:54,280
Father, if you keeping
talking like this,

2012
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:56,320
there's going to be no meaning
for me to stay in this house.

2013
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,080
If you really do care about your son,

2014
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:00,080
then come to the place
where I'm going to be in.

2015
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:01,920
The cop's daughter is feeling better now

2016
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,240
Sister, since then he's
always been like this.

2017
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:05,480
He keeps drinking and
blabbering all the time.

2018
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:08,800
Can you promise me one thing?

2019
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:09,560
Tell me sister,

2020
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,480
I'll do it.

2021
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:14,120
I feel so bad to see him
blabbering at night.

2022
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:17,920
You must somehow join
him back with his mother,

2023
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
only you can do that.

2024
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:21,080
I'll surely do it sister

2025
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:24,840
They'll surely reconcile together.

2026
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:30,600
Only I know the pain of a mother
and son being apart from each other.

2027
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:33,600
Tell him that I told you to
take him to the village, okay?

2028
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:35,560
Yeah, I'll surely take him and go.

2029
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:45,640
You started drinking is it?

2030
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:46,720
Hey, hold this.

2031
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,320
I need to speak with you.

2032
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:52,760
Yeah tell me, what is it?

2033
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,640
You should come with me
to Sri Lanka to find my son.

2034
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:57,960
Sri Lanka is it?

2035
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:00,480
Only you can help me out.

2036
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:03,080
Okay, we'll talk in the morning.
You please leave now.

2037
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,040
You must do me another favour.

2038
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:06,440
What is it?

2039
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,160
You must go and meet your mother.

2040
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:10,400
Why?

2041
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:17,440
Your mother must be feeling the same way,
the way I'm dying to meet my son.

2042
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,800
Whatever it is,
we'll talk in the morning. Please go.

2043
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,960
We'll talk in the morning, go!

2044
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:30,800
You take Govindhan to Sri Lanka.

2045
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,280
He'll be very helpful for you.

2046
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,360
He's not like any other person.

2047
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:36,960
He will take care of you properly.

2048
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:40,760
Sister, tomorrow morning
you go to my travel agent

2049
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:43,640
I will come there along with him
after he meets his mother

2050
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:47,000
You can go to Sri Lanka
after he gets the passport

2051
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:57,360
Give this to your parents.

2052
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:58,480
Why all this?

2053
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:05,600
Give this chain to your mother and
ask her to wear it on.

2054
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:08,960
You never wore it till the end.

2055
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:14,680
Whether you're going to wear it or not,

2056
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:16,040
let this be with you.

2057
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:17,560
I'll take your leave.

2058
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,400
Hey, the car isn't getting started.
Get down, we'll see to it tomorrow.

2059
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:35,400
Why brother?

2060
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:38,520
No, no, you sit inside.

2061
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:40,000
I'll push the car from behind.

2062
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,200
Velayudham, you too come.

2063
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:43,400
Yeah, coming sister.

2064
01:55:46,680 --> 01:55:47,880
Push it.

2065
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:54,200
Start the car.

2066
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,200
I told you right.

2067
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:04,760
The car isn't getting started.

2068
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:07,000
The car itself doesn't like
me going to the village.

2069
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:08,320
We'll see to it another day.

2070
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:11,520
No, no, you must go meet
your mother and come back.

2071
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:12,880
But the car isn't getting started.

2072
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:15,520
Brother! Come brother,
let's go in our vehicle.

2073
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,240
Hmmm.

2074
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:24,200
Okay.

2075
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:28,520
I'll go and come back.

2076
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:46,240
Hey!

2077
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,200
Come buddy!

2078
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:50,120
What buddy?

2079
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:53,720
Where are you going?

2080
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,280
I'm going to meet my mother.

2081
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:56,960
Hey, today is my birthday man.

2082
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,400
Congratulations, buddy.

2083
01:56:58,480 --> 01:56:59,920
Come, let's have a drink and go.

2084
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,360
No buddy, I'm going to meet my mother.
We'll see to it another day.

2085
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:03,720
Hey, come man.

2086
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:04,680
No, we can't do that.

2087
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,000
Hey, no one called you.
Shut and go man.

2088
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:06,840
You come buddy. Come.

2089
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,760
Why is he speaking
so disrespectfully to a big man like that?

2090
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,000
He'll speak like that
only, you shut and come.

2091
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:11,280
- Come, buddy.
- This not good

2092
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:13,200
Buddy! I'll only
take a small peg.

2093
01:57:13,240 --> 01:57:14,720
Take a light drink and go.

2094

Who's this speaking?

2111
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,480
Where is Govindhan?

2112
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,600
The person who had this
phone and the person...

2113
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:38,800
who was along with him have
gotten into a bike accident.

2114
01:58:38,840 --> 01:58:39,680

2118
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:47,160
The accident took place near Poonamallee.

2119
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:47,880
Drunk and drive.

2120
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:49,040
Drunk?

2121
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:50,520
Impossible!

2122
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:51,680

01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:58,480
Now we're going in a 108 ambulance
to a hospital nearby.

2126
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,120

01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:07,800
The cell battery is also getting low.

2130
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:11,680
Excuse me? Please,
I don't have a mobile phone.

2131
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:16,000

2154
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,040

2167
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:51,000

Yeah!

2169
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:53,560
I was told that they're admitted here.

2170
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:54,360

You'll only get the body in the morning.

2176
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,360

02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:14,040
Oh! Please transfer me to the emergency.

2181
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:15,040

2188
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:33,840
so can you tell me some
details about him?

2189
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:34,600
How is he?

2190
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:35,920
He's in a critical stage.

2191
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:37,040
Severe skull injury.

2192
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:38,440
We're trying our best.

2193
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:39,680
Anything can happen.

2194
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:41,040
Who are you?

2195
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:43,440
Doctor, can you do me a favour, please?

2196
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:44,520
Tell me

2197
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:46,560
Can you just note down my number?

2198
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:48,120
I don't have a mobile phone.

2199
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:51,520
Can you just keep me posted
on that number, about his health?

2200
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:52,480
Okay,

2201
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:53,560

02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,480

02:03:02,920 --> 02:03:04,080
Okay.

2205
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:06,680
Thank you, doctor.

2206
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:08,000
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

2207
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:28,920
Hello!

2208
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:31,520
Hello madam, you enquired us
about Mr. Govindhan right?

2209
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:32,760
We couldn't save him.

2210
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,160
He had passed away.

2211
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:38,040
His relatives are saying that
they want to take his body and go.

2212
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,360
Can I permit them?

2213
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,200
My son...

2214
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:05,880
My son...

2215
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:08,720
Whether you're going to wear it or not,

2216
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,320
let this be with you.

2217
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:11,720
I'll take your leave.

2218
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:46,800
I won't leave you alone, mother.

2219
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:49,600
It seems that we have a nation for
ourselves with Tamil as our mother tongue.

2220
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:52,160
You come take me and go with you.
