1
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:41,904
All this..

2
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:44,004
How come all these things are here!?

3
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:49,840
How come this television is on!?

4
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:58,849
Who?

5
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,852
Who?

6
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,899
He was crazy about drugs.

7
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,896
Perhaps the dose might
have been large.

8
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:44,828
Used to take cocaine.

9
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:02,312
Whatever seems to be appearing..

10
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,857
..something more than
this has happened here.

11
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,117
To tell you the truth, sir..
l fell asleep for a while.

12
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:11,855
ls your duty to keep waking
or to fall asleep?

13
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:14,327
Of course l was employed
here to keep waking..

14
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:18,861
..but.. sometimes on Mr.
Singhania's orders..

15
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,406
..l had to keep my eyes close.

16
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,031
Talk something meaningful?

17
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,041
Meaning l used to perform my duty
for both the madam and the sir.

18
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:28,338
The madam used to pay me to keep
an eye on the visitors..

19
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:31,043
..and the sir used to pay me to
turn a blind eye on the visitors.

20
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:34,880
So tonight you were paid
to turn a blind eye?

21
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:37,423
Yes. Since the madam isn't in town.

22
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,287
What's your madam's name?

23
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,053
Mrs. Ria Singhania.

24
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:52,828
Sir, this is the air-tickets'
counter file..

25
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,992
..that Ria Singhania
travelled with.

26
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:57,296
And this file has a listing
of the hotel bills, sir.

27
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,835
According to them.. Ria Singhania..

28
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:01,840
..stayed in this very hotel in
Dubai from the 27th to the 29th May.

29
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:04,035
These are the details of
the credit card, sir.

30
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,840
According to them she did
a lot of shopping in Dubai.

31
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:09,846
Sir, why are you after that woman?

32
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:11,847
l feel the poor woman is innocent.

33
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,843
And what do you feel?

34
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,185
Rather l suspect Mr. Singhania's
girlfriend, sir.

35
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:19,919
Sonia Sharma.

36
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,857
She works in some Ad agency.

37
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:25,194
Mrs. Singhania has said
in her statement..

38
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:27,358
..that she was completely
unaware of this affair.

39
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:32,031
Apart from this there's one more
man, sir, who's under suspicion.

40
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:35,034
Siddharth Sardesai.

41
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:38,873
He was a sales executive in
Mr. Singhania's company.

42
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,976
But as of now.. he has a 25
percent stake in her company.

43
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,154
Siddharth Sardesai?

44
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:54,824
We all know that Mr.
Singhania has build..

45
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:57,158
..this company with
all his hard work.

46
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:04,226
And his sudden death has
jolted us one and all.

47
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,831
Now we'll have to reorganise
this company..

48
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,377
..and everything in here..
- Has to be changed!

49
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,844
Good morning, everyone.

50
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,853
Please.

51
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,267
You wanted to say the
same, isn't it?

52
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:37,394
That we should be changing
the things..

53
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,200
..that can cause a loss
to this company?

54
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,334
Well..
- Right? - Right.

55
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,141
From today on you'll take any order
directly from me and none else.

56
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:50,273
Zenia..
- Yes?

57
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,818
The daily report of every
department should reach my table.

58
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:54,146
Yes, ma'am.

59
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,814
Nikita, when can l get hold
of the progress charts..

60
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,085
..of the previous five years?
- Within two days, ma'am.

61
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:03,820
Mr. Murti.. come into my cabin
within half an hour..

62
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:06,161
..with this year's account details.
- Yes, ma'am.

63
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,326
By all this you..
- Not you.. call me ma'am!

64
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:14,837
This meeting is over.

65
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,842
Can l know what my fault is? Huh!?

66
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:27,009
You very well knew that
Amit was cheating on me!

67
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:28,852
What nonsense!?

68
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,855
He was having an affair with
someone! - Ria, you're..

69
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:33,859
Yes or no?!

70
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:40,190
Yes.
- That's it.

71
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,394
l've got my reply. And
you've got yours.

72
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:47,971
One more thing.. you're the
company's publicity in-charge, right?

73
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:51,201
Yes.

74
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:53,404
l've seen the designs.
They are too bad.

75
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:57,349
Call the Ad agency and order them
to start with a new campaign.

76
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:01,211
Or else change the Ad agency.

77
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:04,152
l want results. You've got two days.

78
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:16,832
Hi. - The thing happened that
l dreaded. - Meaning?

79
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:20,029
She has reached the office.
- So what's your problem?

80
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:21,834
The problem is not
for me but for you.

81
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,034
Good morning.
- Hi.

82
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:25,168
She needs a new Ad campaign
in two days..

83
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,042
..or else she'll change
the Ad agency.

84
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,307
Oh my God!

85
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:33,011
l hope she has come to know about..
me and Amit? - No.

86
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:36,019
But she does know that Amit
had some girlfriend.

87
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:38,850
And that too as well that
l introduced them both.

88
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:40,859
So.. so, what should be done now?

89
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,120
Get along with your boss
and think of something..

90
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:45,460
..or else neither your dream
will realise nor mine.

91
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,877
Aditya..

92
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:00,344
Aditya, will you stop playing?

93
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,075
l'm not playing. l'm thinking.

94
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:04,275
Thinking!?

95
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,080
Can l ask you what novel
way of thinking is this?

96
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:09,485
Not just the way.. in fact
the whole thought is novel.

97
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:13,222
We've to make a new
Ad for Home Theatre.

98
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:15,886
So l'm checking the Dolby effect.

99
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:17,891
The pathetic walls of our company..

100
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:19,898
..won't be able to stand up
with this idea of yours.

101
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,397
You're playing in here..
but the sound is..

102
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:22,900
..reverberating in
the whole building.

103
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,063
Yes! l've got it!

104
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:27,402
Thank you, Sonia. Thank
you very much.

105
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:29,065
Video Sound Home Theatre!

106
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:32,444
'You'll see it! But your whole
building shall hear to it!'

107
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:33,911
Thank you.

108
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,174
Aditya.. Aditya, where
are you going?

109
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,911
l've got to talk something
important with you.

110
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,078
Tomorrow. Between 9:30 and 6:30.

111
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,386
Aditya, we've to find a new
idea for SpyKar jeans.

112
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,448
The presentation is
in the next two days.

113
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:49,017
But right now it's very important
for me to be present somewhere else.

114
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,194
Bye, Sonia. Thank you.
- Aditya..

115
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,862
Aditya..
- Bye, Sonia. - Damn it!

116
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,352
Had you not come in another
few moments then..

117
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:17,889
..l would have taken a lift from
someone else and left for home.

118
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:21,356
Sorry. What should l do?
- What should l do?!

119
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:23,895
'l cannot tie myself
with the watch!'

120
00:11:24,297 --> 00:11:27,289
'My wife and kids can wait
for me.. but my ideas..'

121
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,301
'..my ideas can never
wait for anything!'

122
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:31,229
Right?!
- Right.

123
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:33,499
Who else can understand the
importance of ideas other than you?

124
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,897
Had l not struck with the idea..

125
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:38,239
..in a Borivali bound local
train six years back..

126
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:40,905
..then how come would l've got a
wife more beautiful..

127
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,381
..and nicest than
you anywhere else?

128
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:48,345
And where could l've got
such a loving husband?

129
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:50,246
Right.

130
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:53,018
But l hate you for coming
late every time.

131
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,860
Today's consumer considers three
things while going for a product.

132
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,865
Value for money.. quality
of the product.. and style.

133
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,867
Because your product..

134
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,404
Carry on.

135
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:15,140
Because your product falls
in the high price range..

136
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:17,205
..so the style is more
important than..

137
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:20,343
..value for money
and quality of product.

138
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:23,079
Hence our catch-line should be..

139
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,886
'Cares for your skin..
and gives you a style.'

140
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,890
Wow!

141
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:29,426
Fantastic!

142
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:31,156
l don't think we need anything else.

143
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,891
lt's good. Really good.

144
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,230
You call it a presentation?

145
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:39,904
Every time.. you called this
product as 'Your product.'

146
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,908
lf you won't accept this
product as yours..

147
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:45,842
..and if you don't love it.. and
you won't tell it's advantage..

148
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:48,847
..then why the hell will
the consumer buy it?

149
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:52,183
l think this is not your cup of tea.

150
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,114
You're talking bullshit.
- Aditya!

151
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,246
One second, man. Now
just listen to me.

152
00:12:57,457 --> 00:12:59,322
The thing that you want to sell
if you're in love with it..

153
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:01,257
..then you won't be
able to sell it ever.

154
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:04,126
Today's consumer is
not a fool, madam.

155
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:07,858
The more your try to hide your
product's shortcomings..

156
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,868
..the more he'll doubt about it.

157
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:12,402
Similarly..

158
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:14,872
..lf you call this cold-drink
the best in the world..

159
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:16,875
..that can quench your thirst..

160
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:21,039
..then none is going to
give a damn care, madam.

161
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:23,477
Because what's new in this?

162
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:26,882
Every cold-drink manufacturer
in the world tells the same.

163
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,157
But if you say this.. 'This cold-
drink will stir the thirst in you..'

164
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,887
Then this might prove effective.

165
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:37,225
We're all in this business
to earn money.

166
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,890
Since the consumer isn't interested
in your product..

167
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:45,836
..because you love your
product so much..

168
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:50,035
..rather he wants to see.. what
are you giving him for his money.

169
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:53,236
Okay?

170
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:56,843
Good bye.

171
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:02,852
Who's this man?

172
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,853
Aditya.. Aditya Malhotra.

173
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,862
Hi, Milee.
- Hi. - Looking good. - Thank you.

174
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:16,197
Where's Neha?
- ln the cabin. - OK. Thank you.

175
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:18,870
lf you give your assent
for the operation..

176
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:22,135
..then not alone your son's
life will be saved..

177
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:28,146
..but that other kid's body organ
shall remain intact as well.

178
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:32,878
You're a mother..

179
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,886
..and you can very well understand
the pain of that mother.

180
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:37,883
Had you been in that
mother's place..

181
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,891
..then what else would you've done?

182
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,824
Give it a proper thought
and then decide.

183
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:50,158
lf you find it okay..
then sign over here.

184
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:57,166
The doctor is right. Better sign.

185
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,843
Go ahead.

186
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:09,851
How do you manage all this?

187
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:11,316
How do you manage to keep yourself..

188
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,857
..so cool and composed in
such difficult situations?

189
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,854
When it's a question of
saving someone's life..

190
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:18,863
..then a human can do anything.

191
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,133
Big words!

192
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:34,135
Let's see what our son has done.

193
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,374
English? Fantastic.

194
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:42,876
Science? Just like his mother.

195
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:45,321
And craft? He's just my son.

196
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:47,154
What are you looking at?
- Just that..

197
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:59,837
100 out of 100.

198
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:01,166
What happened?

199
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:03,241
At this sight of yours..

200
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,006
..the poet within me has risen up.
- Go ahead.

201
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:09,843
To begin with..

202
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:18,114
'These swaying drops of water
as they kiss the tresses..'

203
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:29,125
'..these drops of water as they
slip through this velvety shoulder..'

204
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:34,137
'..these frozen moments..'

205
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:40,404
'..these raging heart beats..'

206
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:43,877
'..l feel like..'

207
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:50,314
'..l should just keep watching you!'

208
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:53,822
'Keep watching you!'

209
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:02,831
lf you'll listen to your heart..
then the whole night..

210
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:06,167
..shall pass away just in watching.

211
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,337
Listen to my heart.. ..as
to what is it saying.

212
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:24,017
What is it saying?
- That.. let your lips..

213
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:27,854
..complete the rest of the poetry..

214
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:30,122
..so that Time doesn't get
the chance to complain.

215
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,141
Adi!

216
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:58,818
Good news, man! Good news!

217
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:01,357
Ria Singhania is ready
to sign the contract!

218
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:03,154
C'mon! C'mon get up!

219
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:05,493
We've to go to her house
for the meeting! - But..

220
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:07,031
No ifs and buts.. you'll
have to come along!

221
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,831
Sir.. there was a call
from Ria Singhania..

222
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:12,166
..she has just called Mr.
Aditya for the discussion.

223
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:17,369
Boss.. but l don't go
to anybody's house.

224
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,377
Why should l discuss official
matters at somebody's house?

225
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:22,107
Not for your sake.. but at least
go for the company's sake.

226
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:25,008
She's a very important
client for us.

227
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:29,349
And, look.. do whatever
she tells you to do.

228
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:35,259
Whom do you want to meet?
- Ria Singhania.

229
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:37,852
Park it over there.

230
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:42,017
The mornings are restive.

231
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:48,865
And the evenings are
restive as well.

232
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:55,035
The mornings are restive.

233
00:19:56,208 --> 00:20:01,874
And the evenings are
restive as well.

234
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:12,222
Don't know since how long my
heart is waiting for the one?

235
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:20,888
The one who'll come and lend
me my share of peace.

236
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:31,066
The mornings are restive.

237
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:38,080
And the evenings are
restive as well.

238
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:27,889
l hope some time or the other..

239
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:34,896
..my dream shall come true.

240
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:41,379
Some day from somewhere..

241
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:49,377
..some person shall come across.

242
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:01,129
The one for whom my heart's
waiting since long..

243
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:10,199
The one who'll come and lend
me my share of peace.

244
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:19,943
The mornings are restive.

245
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:26,425
And the evenings are
restive as well.

246
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:16,274
Till now.. my desire..

247
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:23,042
..is a barren piece of land.

248
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:32,949
But don't know why..

249
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:38,892
..my heart's very much sure.

250
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:49,307
Some season there shall be
to bring spring in my life..

251
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:58,006
lt shall be the one to come and
lend me my share of peace.

252
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:08,854
The mornings are restive.

253
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:15,131
And the evenings are
restive as well.

254
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,225
You!

255
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:51,826
When did you come?
- A while ago.

256
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh. A while ago.

257
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,373
Come. Join me.

258
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:04,173
Will you drink something?
- No. Thanks.

259
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:09,343
Do you know why did l go
to your agency yesterday?

260
00:25:10,355 --> 00:25:15,452
Yes, to give your Ad contract
to our agency. - Wrong.

261
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:17,851
Rather to cancel the contract.

262
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,857
But after meeting you..
l changed my mind.

263
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:24,260
What's so special in me?

264
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:32,867
The special thing is
not in you but me.

265
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:36,204
l recognise the right
man at the right time.

266
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:39,216
You're different.

267
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:41,877
l didn't get you!

268
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:46,153
Better join for me.
l'll pay you double.

269
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:49,092
lt's not in my character to leave
the old friends for new ones.

270
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,996
By the way.. l want to show
you a scratch film.

271
00:25:56,435 --> 00:25:59,233
lf you like the idea.. then
we'll discuss ahead.

272
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:05,003
You can do whatever you want to.

273
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:08,438
l'm sure.. l'll like
everything of yours.

274
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:12,008
lt has.. got the budget details.

275
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:15,179
Send it to the office by tomorrow
morning after signing it.

276
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:22,022
There's a long night between
tomorrow morning and today evening.

277
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:25,254
And l don't want to spoil
a single night of yours.

278
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,193
Pen?

279
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:30,860
Oh.. Yes!

280
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:40,204
Thanks.

281
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:43,881
Thank you.

282
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:49,812
Okay, l.. l.. tomorrow night..
l mean.. l mean..

283
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:52,823
..l'll start the work
from tonight itself.

284
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,185
The Ad film seems nice.
- No doubt it's nice..

285
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,244
..but Ria shouldn't find it nice..

286
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:27,852
..or else not you but Aditya will
be handling this account.

287
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:36,193
What's all this?

288
00:27:36,368 --> 00:27:37,858
lt's.. it's complete nonsense!

289
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:41,028
lt's bullshit according
to our traditions!

290
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:42,867
l think it's great.

291
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,301
lt's perfect according
to the image of SpyKar.

292
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,006
Good job.

293
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,810
None was able to do the
thing that you did.

294
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,084
Good job!
- Thanks.

295
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:55,813
Why don't you come with me?

296
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:57,353
We'll discuss about
the campaign logo..

297
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:58,821
..and the hoardings
while on the way?

298
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:01,148
Yes, but at this moment..
- This moment.

299
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:04,821
lt's should be done right away.
Time is money, my dear friend.

300
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:21,843
Where have you brought me?

301
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,841
You wanted to discuss something,
isn't it?

302
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:29,843
Relax!

303
00:28:30,322 --> 00:28:31,846
Come with me.

304
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,849
C'mon!

305
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:58,810
Sorry, l.. don't drink while l work.

306
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:02,152
And l don't work while l'm drinking.

307
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,991
lf you'll put so much of stress on
your brain.. then it'll explode!

308
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:13,323
You've to do a lot many things
for my company.. and for me.

309
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:17,167
As of now.. the work
that you did today..

310
00:29:17,235 --> 00:29:19,430
..l'm giving you this
treat for that.

311
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:22,837
So, c'mon.

312
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:27,171
Let's hit the floor.

313
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,837
No.. l'm fine in here.

314
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:32,176
As you wish.

315
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:18,052
l dread this thirst doesn't
make me wild!

316
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:22,361
Shower, O' clouds!

317
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:26,068
Shower, O' clouds!

318
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,432
Shower, O' clouds!

319
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:32,908
Shower, O' clouds!

320
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:39,244
Enjoy heartily the fragrance
of my body today.

321
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,912
Shower, O' clouds!

322
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:46,856
Shower, O' clouds!

323
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:34,495
A thousand desires are
stirring within..

324
00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:41,069
..and you know a damn about
the solitude of my body!

325
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,242
A thousand desires are
stirring within..

326
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,849
..and you know a damn about
the solitude of my body!

327
00:31:55,193 --> 00:32:01,063
l feel like melting in your arms.

328
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:05,031
Shower, O' clouds!

329
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,362
Shower, O' clouds!

330
00:32:22,887 --> 00:32:25,879
Shower, O' clouds!

331
00:32:26,057 --> 00:32:28,890
Shower, O' clouds!

332
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:32,492
Shower, O' clouds!

333
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:35,897
Shower, O' clouds!

334
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:43,440
Go ahead and drown
me in your desires..

335
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:48,844
..since l find comfort
in just your arms.

336
00:32:53,251 --> 00:32:55,446
Go ahead and drown
me in your desires..

337
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:02,016
..since l find comfort
in just your arms.

338
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:10,034
l always find myself
forlorn without you.

339
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:13,870
Shower, O' clouds!

340
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:17,332
Shower, O' clouds!

341
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:23,075
l dread this thirst doesn't
make me wild!

342
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:27,883
Shower, O' clouds!

343
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:31,088
Shower, O' clouds!

344
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:56,006
Now we should be going.

345
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:58,844
ln this condition? We'll catch cold.

346
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,354
See.. l've already caught it.

347
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:08,020
l need to change.
- Where?

348
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,855
Here. l'll change in here.

349
00:34:18,203 --> 00:34:19,261
C'mon!

350
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:23,866
You might be thinking where
l have brought you.

351
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:27,141
This is my husband's apartment.

352
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:30,876
He's love-shack.

353
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,883
Come, come.

354
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:34,875
C'mon!

355
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:37,888
Alright, alright, l'm
coming. l'm coming.

356
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:40,422
lt's a different thing that..

357
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:44,995
Make yourself comfortable, nah!

358
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:51,999
lt's a different thing that l came
to know about this after his death.

359
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:56,830
Now you might be thinking that
if l didn't knew about it..

360
00:34:56,908 --> 00:35:01,038
..then how come these dresses
are here, isn't it?

361
00:35:02,247 --> 00:35:03,839
Even they are not mine!

362
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,013
They are his girlfriend's!

363
00:35:12,323 --> 00:35:13,847
This!

364
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:16,858
All these!

365
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:18,860
This as well!

366
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,854
This as well!

367
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:24,260
This as well!

368
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,863
He used to cheat on me!

369
00:35:29,941 --> 00:35:31,875
He used to cheat on me!

370
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:35,869
Look.. what's the use of
thinking of the past?

371
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:39,382
Now what's the need to
ponder over the dead?

372
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:42,876
You're right!

373
00:35:44,155 --> 00:35:47,147
One shouldn't ponder over
the one who is dead!

374
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,095
Rather one should be thinking
about the one who's present!

375
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,226
Okay?

376
00:35:58,303 --> 00:35:59,827
What do l lack?

377
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:01,835
Am l not pretty?

378
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:07,007
Still he used to cheat on me?

379
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,841
Why?

380
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:21,852
Why?

381
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,390
Look.. l'll make a move.

382
00:36:30,335 --> 00:36:33,031
We'll talk in the morning tomorrow.
- Morning?

383
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:37,867
The mistake that your
husband commit..

384
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:40,137
..l don't want to repeat the same.

385
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,870
Bye.

386
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,974
You had told me that papa
will drop me today?

387
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:20,040
l've my football practice
before the class.

388
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:23,178
lt's already 7:30.. and
papa's still sleeping!

389
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:24,846
Who said papa's sleeping?

390
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,455
Papa will definitely drop you to
school but on one condition..

391
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:32,257
..and that you'll surely
win the football match.

392
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:35,389
No matter if you break
someone's head or leg.

393
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:36,865
What are you teaching him?

394
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:38,869
Ssh. This is something between us.

395
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,137
Agreed?
- Agreed. - That's like a good boy!

396
00:37:42,206 --> 00:37:43,332
C'mon! C'mon!

397
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:45,069
Last night you were late again?

398
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:47,972
Yeah.. l got late because
of that same client.

399
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:51,978
Who's this client after all who
steals away your wife's time?

400
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:55,980
l hope this client isn't
some beautiful girl?

401
00:37:57,088 --> 00:38:00,819
Hey! We're still here! We'll
get late! Let's go! Let's go!

402
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:03,890
The water bottle!
- Yeah.

403
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:06,224
Bye!
- Bye!

404
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:11,825
Hello.
- Hi.. Hi, Ria.

405
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:15,165
Oh it's you! l was
waiting for your call.

406
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,176
Ria, l wanted to talk with you
about the company policies.

407
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:22,439
And.. - Even l've a lot many things
to do right now.

408
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:25,843
But right now l'm busy in a meeting.

409
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:28,007
Why don't you do one thing?

410
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:32,016
Somewhere around 4.. come to
our office at the City Mall.

411
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:36,855
My office is quite near.
We'll talk right there.

412
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:38,996
Ria.. l've some problem..

413
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:44,795
Man, she's coming at the
City Mall at 4 o'clock.

414
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:47,201
And she has called me there.
l won't go there, man.

415
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:51,206
Go, man. This contract is very
necessary for our company.

416
00:38:52,076 --> 00:38:53,805
Moreover, you're aware of
the company's plight.

417
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:56,806
Anyhow this contract should
be signed today itself.

418
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:01,209
No..

419
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:02,809
..it's not looking nice.

420
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,149
Alright.

421
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:05,822
Hi! Come in.

422
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:08,153
Do it right away.

423
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:11,317
Change it.
- Okay, ma'am. - Thank you.

424
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:12,829
Hi.
- Hi.

425
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:17,300
A surprise visit in the showroom.
Keep the employees in check.

426
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:19,302
Don't you think? - Right.

427
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:26,843
Finally l see a good section.

428
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:32,373
Smart.

429
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,849
What?

430
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:42,115
Gift.

431
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:44,858
l'm giving you a gift
for the first time.

432
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:46,855
Take good care of it.

433
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,195
Yeah, but..

434
00:39:53,337 --> 00:39:54,861
Gift-wrap it.
- Yes, ma'am.

435
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:57,874
Excuse me.

436
00:39:58,142 --> 00:40:00,201
Sign on this paper.. l..
l mean contract.

437
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:05,280
Can l read it before signing?
- Yeah, sure.

438
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,881
Ma'am.
- Thanks.

439
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:13,053
Excuse me. Just read it.

440
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:18,057
Let's go home. l'll
sign it right there.

441
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:44,854
Sit.

442
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:53,857
On the rock?

443
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:55,857
Okay.

444
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:12,879
Here.

445
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:15,882
Thanks.

446
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:49,046
What's it?!

447
00:41:51,022 --> 00:41:52,182
What do you want?!

448
00:41:52,323 --> 00:41:55,850
Didn't l tell you.. that
you'll get your money?!

449
00:41:57,195 --> 00:41:59,060
Don't ever call me again for money!

450
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:03,130
l won't get scared of
your threatening!

451
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:08,864
Whoever l'm with.. What have
you got to do with that?!

452
00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:11,202
Stay in your limits!

453
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:16,070
How dare you?!

454
00:42:23,888 --> 00:42:25,879
Remember one thing carefully..

455
00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:28,886
..this business of yours
won't survive for long!

456
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:31,889
Don't call me ever again!

457
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:33,894
ls that clear?!

458
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:42,301
Searching for me?
- Huh!?

459
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:45,838
Oh, no.. l just came to say..

460
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:51,848
..l should be going.
You don't bother.

461
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,048
l'll get it signed. Tomorrow l'll..
- Where do you want to go?

462
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:01,055
Home.
- lsn't this home? - Yes, of course!

463
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:15,035
Ria.. indeed this is a home.

464
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,069
But this is your home.

465
00:43:18,609 --> 00:43:20,201
l'm getting late for my home.

466
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,877
lt's obvious.. indeed that
place is called home..

467
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:32,889
..wherein a beautiful wife waits
for her husband every evening.

468
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:37,891
And as far as this house
is concerned..

469
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:40,897
..my dream of making it a home
never really materialised!

470
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:45,230
There were evenings often in here.

471
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:48,168
And did wait for him every day.

472
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:52,166
But he often spent his
nights elsewhere.

473
00:43:54,845 --> 00:43:56,836
With someone else!

474
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:02,444
l've borne humiliation more
than this solitude.

475
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:15,026
l wish we'd met before!

476
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:19,202
l wish you were not married!

477
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,862
Ria..

478
00:44:22,273 --> 00:44:27,210
Had you not been married.. then
you would have left me as well?

479
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:32,208
Look, Ria..
- Don't say anything.

480
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:33,875
Don't say anything!

481
00:47:21,385 --> 00:47:22,852
Good morning, sweetheart.

482
00:47:24,255 --> 00:47:25,847
Surprise! Surprise!

483
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,852
Okay, so it's a tie?

484
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:36,856
Who gave it?
- Where did you find this?

485
00:47:37,134 --> 00:47:39,261
lt was in the car. Probably
you forgot it.

486
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:41,861
Nice colour.

487
00:47:42,473 --> 00:47:43,872
Hmm?

488
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:46,801
Some client gave it.

489
00:47:49,213 --> 00:47:52,341
Smart client.. who knows
to keep you happy.

490
00:47:53,217 --> 00:47:56,812
And you're working so much for him
that you've forgotten me as well.

491
00:47:56,987 --> 00:47:59,217
No, man. lt's nothing like that.

492
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,019
lt's just a matter of
few days. Few days.

493
00:48:01,992 --> 00:48:04,825
lf it's a matter of days.. then
better keep it for the days..

494
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:06,829
..at least come on time at nights.

495
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,292
ls this client some..
- lt isn't a girl, man.

496
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:13,836
How many times have l told you?

497
00:48:14,004 --> 00:48:15,437
lf you keep asking me the same
question in different ways..

498
00:48:15,506 --> 00:48:17,030
..then my reply won't
change. Got it?!

499
00:48:17,107 --> 00:48:19,098
Okay, okay, okay. Chill. Chill.

500
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:21,834
l'm setting out for work. l've
prepared the breakfast.

501
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:24,173
Eat and go. l love you.
- Love you.

502
00:48:25,115 --> 00:48:26,844
Oho! Tie!

503
00:49:13,163 --> 00:49:14,221
Hello.

504
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:16,823
Mr. Malhotra, how did you
find the photographs?

505
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,834
Who are you?
- l'm a businessman.

506
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:20,830
How dare you send the photographs
at my home?!

507
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:22,905
Rather you're the daring one, sir.

508
00:49:23,107 --> 00:49:25,837
Despite having a young and
beautiful wife.. - Shut up!

509
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:27,843
And don't dare to say a single
word about my wife!

510
00:49:28,112 --> 00:49:30,171
Neither l'll say anything to Neha..

511
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:32,181
..nor l'll say anything about Neha.

512
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:34,840
lt's just that you'll have
a pay a price for it.

513
00:49:36,186 --> 00:49:40,350
Okay. Meet me in Holiday lnn
tomorrow. And we'll talk there.

514
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:42,322
Listen to three things
very carefully.

515
00:49:43,027 --> 00:49:46,053
First.. the location will
be mine and not yours.

516
00:49:47,064 --> 00:49:50,192
And secondly.. l won't face you.

517
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:54,263
You'll have to drop the
envelope at my location.

518
00:49:55,339 --> 00:49:59,867
And the third and final thing..
the amount will be 500,000.

519
00:50:00,044 --> 00:50:02,205
And this is just the
first instalment.

520
00:50:02,279 --> 00:50:05,146
Look.. look, till you don't meet
me l won't give you a single..

521
00:50:06,216 --> 00:50:07,274
Hello!

522
00:50:07,384 --> 00:50:08,874
Hello!

523
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:10,876
Hello!

524
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:25,895
Come. Please do come, Mr.
Aditya Malhotra.

525
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:38,076
Mr. Malhotra?
- Yes.

526
00:50:39,316 --> 00:50:41,910
Kelly Dorjee.. investigating
officer.

527
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:47,180
l wanted to talk to you about
Mr. Singhania's murder.

528
00:50:48,058 --> 00:50:49,184
Murder!?

529
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,328
But Mr. Singhania's death was..

530
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:53,863
Wasn't because of drugs overdose.

531
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:58,259
lnstead the killer made an attempt
to mislead the police.

532
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:01,863
Yes.. but how can
l help you in this?

533
00:51:02,206 --> 00:51:04,868
Rather we're here to
help you, Mr. Aditya.

534
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:09,277
Right now Mr. Singhania's wife
leads our suspects' list.

535
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,874
She has killed her husband
with such ease..

536
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,884
..that it should appear
to be suicide.

537
00:51:15,052 --> 00:51:17,077
But why are you telling me all this?

538
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:22,554
Because Mrs. Singhania
is young and stunning.

539
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,062
And if she decides.. then
she can lead anyone astray.

540
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:28,892
l really don't understand
what you all want to say.

541
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,892
l'll explain you.

542
00:51:33,237 --> 00:51:35,398
You're a nice human being.

543
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:38,432
And you're working
for Ria Singhania.

544
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:40,372
Right?
- Yes.

545
00:51:40,444 --> 00:51:43,902
And l've come to tell you that it
would be better if this issue..

546
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:53,353
Not this. Here.. here..
From here. Eat.

547
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,321
Adi, he has grown up. Let him eat.
- lt's okay. l'm his father.

548
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:01,864
Yeah, from here.

549
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:18,872
Drink it. Don't leave it.
Just finish it. Yes.

550
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:36,896
ls she your acquaintance?

551
00:52:37,067 --> 00:52:42,164
No.. the manager isn't my
acquaintance.. - Manager!?

552
00:52:43,073 --> 00:52:44,836
Eat, man! Eat it!

553
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:47,840
l..

554
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:49,845
l'll go to the toilet and be
right back. - Leaving the food?

555
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:51,847
l think l'm having loose motions.

556
00:53:03,193 --> 00:53:04,854
What are you doing?

557
00:53:05,195 --> 00:53:06,856
Angry with me?

558
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,190
Not at all.

559
00:53:08,265 --> 00:53:10,358
Then why didn't you come to meet me?

560
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:13,869
lf Diwakar has told
you that l'm here..

561
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:15,404
..then he might have
as well told you..

562
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:16,871
..as to how important
my family is for me.

563
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:20,403
Ria.. look, my family
is waiting for me..

564
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:27,881
Look, l promised to Neha..
What are you doing?!

565
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:29,877
Ria..

566
00:53:31,054 --> 00:53:32,885
l'm quenching my thirst!

567
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:46,826
l am sorry.

568
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:48,838
My wife's there!

569
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:52,232
Sorry!

570
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:02,451
You've been a very good boy.
Now very lightly.

571
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,248
Hey! You had your food?
- Yes, papa.

572
00:54:05,022 --> 00:54:07,183
Then who'll join daddy?

The food has gone cold.
- Yes, no..

574
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:12,122
..actually the stomach's upset.

575
00:54:12,462 --> 00:54:14,123
The situation's a bit bad.

576
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:16,857
