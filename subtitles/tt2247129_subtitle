My heart's gone somewhere

Original Sub Maker - AIM Yasir Efaz

00:01:43,820 --> 00:02:09,820
<b> <i> Smoking and drinking are harmful to health!
It is one of the leading causes of cancer. </b> </i>

4
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Is the problem here?

5
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,520
Who is your leader?

6
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,740
Don't you have any shame?

7
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,870
You have yet to complete the entire course.
(Fail in all subjects)

8
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,890
I allow everyone to go on tour (picnic).
Except you

9
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Come on ... come on ...

10
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Hi, Dad ... Hi, Mom ...

11
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
I'm so tired ...

12
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,470
Because of college or playing cricket !!!

13
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,790
Of course "college", Dad.

14
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,620
Cricket is never tiring !!!

15
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,940
hey, aren't you hungry?

16
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,060
Come wash your hands and face quickly.

17
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,090
the cooking will be over in a while.

18
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,510
How was the interview ???

19
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,240
It's too late ... I can't go for the 16th time.
(End of 16 previous interviews)

20
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,860
It doesn't matter. Don't lose hope.
(Harish - telling his eldest son)

21
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,680
Rather, try again.
What happened if you failed the interview 17 times?

22
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,110
the 16th interview, maybe for you ...

23
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,030
No, Dad ...

24
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,360
I will not give any more interview.

25
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,180
Even after getting the job again
Going to the interview, doesn't look good.

26
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,100
I got the job.

27
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,130
I knew you would get the job.
-Thank you, Mom.

28
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,450
I acted restless, brother.

29
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,080
...... Congratulations .....
- I got the job.

30
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,600
Thanks.

31
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,720
Well done ... well done ...

32
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,650
the job is very simple, will pay a good salary.

33
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,770
Mom, Saturday and Sunday; Two days off.

34
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,300
Dad, I didn't say,
there is no need to do MBA.

35
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
You don't want to do MBA?

36
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,240
To do MBA, you have to take CAT Exam 6 times.
(CAT- Common Admission Test,
For admission to MBA course in India, Computer Based Examination)

37
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,270
Azaira used to put aside ...

38
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,990
25 people applied. she took 3 people from there.
I am one of them.

39
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,020
This is not my son.

40
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
Believe it too?

41
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,460
Brother, I want a treat.

42
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,190
What other treat would you like?
Some math books of Shakuntala Devi, right?

43
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:50,910
No problem.

44
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,340
Nothing like that, bro. Public examination ahead.
I want to be admitted to the coaching center for that.

45
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,260
No need.

46
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,180
I mean, it's time and money
Both will be ruined.

47
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,910
People are more useless than studying
these places are more filled.

48
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,730
Is that why you were admitted?

49
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,460
- That ...
- Get off ... Get off ... Don't fight.

50
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,084
hey, Dad ...

51
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:10,008
You must be admitted if you want.

52
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:11,532
- Harish ...
- Yes, Dad.

53
00:11:11,656 --> 00:11:14,756
Send me and your mother to Singapore once.

54
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,480
Get on the first plane ... That would be fun, wouldn't it?

55
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:18,704
Of course Dad ...

56
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:20,528
- That Varun.
- Hmm ...

57
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:21,852
You do not want to be like your brother?

58
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,276
Exclude it.
I will let him have fun first.

59
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,600
Your promise is broken
Don't fill it with your son.

60
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,524
You have to take it.

61
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:38,648
Hmm ... with my teaching job pay,
After filling three empty stomachs .........

62
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:42,772
If you want to go to Singapore, yours
It will take another 10 years.

63
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,680
We will try our best ... the rest is up to us.

64
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,300
hello, will you be the first to perform?

65
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,130
No, we're at number 2 ...

66
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,650
Can you wait a little half an hour?

67
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,380
Why?

68
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,200
I will send a lorry to my friends
To bring rotten tomatoes.

69
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,220
You have to hit on the face.

70
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,850
What the shell ...
- I saw your practice ... Purai Azaira ...

71
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,170
Did you see that their ajaira practice ...

72
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,300
Let's go ... she went inside ...

73
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,120
Nithya Elavarthia ...

74
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,340
Where ???? Who is she ?????

75
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,270
My Nithya Elavarthia ...

76
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,890
she taught me to live
And then left.

77
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,520
Didn't I tell you?

78
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
Unstable ...

79
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Totally restless ...

80
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,190
But the girl I know,
But she is not this girl.

81
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,310
she was very young then.

82
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,140
That guy, you weren't old then either.

83
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,560
If she had a little girl then,
then you were a little boy too.

84
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,580
there is no such thing.

85
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,510
After much deliberation, she became a fairy for me ...

86
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,130
hey, is everything going in slow motion or not?

87
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,460
Dude, everybody's making fun of Usain Bolt.

88
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Only you are in slow motion ....

89
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,600
I do everything
I can see very clearly.

90
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,830
she turned her head ...

91
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,350
Can you see all this?

92
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
she blinked ...

93
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,800
Can't you see any of this?

94
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,420
I can see it, man ...

95
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,250
But I'm in a little confusion ...

96
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,770
Of the 5 girls here, which one is yours?

97
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,900
You guessed it ...

98
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,920
Oh, my test is as bad as Keka Upper.

99
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
She smiled ...

100
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,070
Did you see

101
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,790
His laughter starts from the left corner of her lips ...

102
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,320
And it twists and turns in the corner of the eye.

103
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,040
Will you bend ?? Is it a lizard?

104
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,460
Whose eyes are you talking about?

105
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,790
I'm talking about her eyes.

106
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,210
Look, she's looking ... looking for my two eyes ...

107
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,440


108
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440


109
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,740


110
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,560
Nithya ...

111
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,580
Good evening everyone ....

112
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,910
We are the organizing team.

113
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,330
Those of you who don't know us ...

114
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,460
And we are not participating in this competition.

115
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,080
Because, if we participate,
We would have won in a pinch.

116
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
My name is Sneha, to my right
Vocals have "Varun Krishna".

117
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,430
Ashok on bass guitar, Manu on keyboard ...

118
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,150
Behind me, there is Praveen in Khanjani,

119
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,180
Suriya on drums and Arun on lead guitar.

120
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
We'll start singing now ...

121
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,820
Varun, what are you doing?

122
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,550
- I'm sorry. One minute.
Please, I am managing.

123
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,370
hey, Mama. Don't start.
Show me, Mama.

124
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,900
the song was awesome, mamma.
- I'm talking to you, come here.

125
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,820
Where are you going?

126
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,040
How did you sing such a beautiful song?

127
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,970
Musicians with you
Quickly caught the song.

128
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,590
Have you practiced this song before?

129
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,520
Damn, no practice, Ray
I don't remember the last time I sang a song.

130
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,440
It's getting extra, man.

131
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,660
Varun, you are in the debate contest
Are you here to take part?

132
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,790
Even if she pays us a thousand rupees,
Even then, don't go inside.

133
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,610
they will kill us with their argument.

134
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,240
That is why we will go in without spending.

135
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Let's go ...

136
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,380
I didn't expect it to be so beautiful ... not bad ...

137
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,810
I lied that I was a competitor.
Can i sit here

138
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,530
Krishna ... and my God ... Varun ...

139
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,660
Hi Jenny ... How are you?

140
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
I haven't seen him since school.

141
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,600
By the way, he is my friend Prakash

142
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,230
Hi ...
- Exclude him ...

143
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:23,950
Varun, you are restless. I never
I never thought you could sing so well.

144
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,980
I have never seen him sing at school.

145
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,600
At the end of school you had no news.

146
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,720
so mean .......

147
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,150
We were very close, weren't we?

148
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,970
then you have no news.

149
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Excessive ...

150
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,220
You know, Nithya and I are still best friends.

151
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,940
In the same college again ...

152
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,270
Although the department is different.

153
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,590
She is studying "psychology". Yuck ...

154
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Stop talking everyone ...

155
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,540
Could all the participants please take your seats?

156
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,860
All right, let's sit down.

157
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,090
Hey come. Will you sit on his lap or not?

158
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,810
the topic of today's debate is ...

159
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,940
"To forgive and forget, strength or weakness? "

160
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
The first participants for today's debate

161
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,180
Nithya Ilavarthi, from Villa Mary College.

162
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,210
Good morning

163
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:17,030
"Forgetting everything, measuring ...
Our strengths or our weaknesses? "

164
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,760
Speaking in English, mamma.
Let's go. Get out of here now.

165
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Sit, sit. -To forgive and forgetting is not to forgive at all. 

166
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,900
To err is human nature.

167
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,900
People will only make mistakes ...

168
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,430
And if any of us follow this rule ourselves
I think outside, but that would be our mistake.

169
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,550
And sad but true ...

170
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,380
the ones we love the most
Most of the time, I can't take care of them.

171
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,000
And in this kind of situation, what about us
there is no way to atone?

172
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:47,220
That's where I heard people fall in love
the way we watch movies or listen to music,
It has made it special for us.

173
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,950
♪ I did not fall in love ...
♪ Love has fallen on me ...

174
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,970
Have you heard the song?

175
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,200
Since, she says forget everything
And measure ...

176
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,320
Do you think she will forget everything?

177
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,440
Of course ...

178
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,270
she's beautiful ... isn't she?

179
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,790
I never thought that
she will be so beautiful ...

180
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,820
hey brother, I like this girl,
I like that girl too .........

181
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,640
Mayata that hot, look mama.

182
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,560
I think so
Every girl likes it.

183
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,890
I was in boys school till class ten.

184
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,900
Sometimes the "second chance" is the greatest gift
Which you can give to your loved one.

185
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,020
And if you love someone ...

186
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,240
Sometimes the "second chance" is the greatest gift
Which you can give yourself.

187
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,670
Much better ...

188
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,590
Thanks.

189
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,320
Which ... Go and talk ....

190
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Shall I go and talk?

191
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,260
Let's start with "Hi ..." "How are you".
I will end with "Let's get married".

192
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,290
It's not so much pasta rice ...

193
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,610
hey, don't listen to me, in this kind of situation
Girls are a lot like gas balloons.

194
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,340
Once released, it will fly away ... which ...
........ All the Best ... Dude.

195
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,960
hey Varun, what are you doing here?

196
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,780
Nothing ...

197
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,010
Will you play with us?
Or play with Nithiya?

198
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,930
Are you a lady or a ray?

199
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,160
I want to play with you, brother.

200
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,080
then come on ...

201
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,800
Dad ... Dad ...
- What happened, dear?

202
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,230
I don't want to talk to Varun.

203
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,250
hey, don't look back.

204
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,480
the cute boy I saw yesterday,
he just came to class.

205
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
What is he wearing today?

206
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,120
After the uniform, look down.

207
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,050
Shut up, don't look at him like that.

208
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,870
Umm, the idea ...

209
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,500
these girls ... girls ... Nithya ......

210
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,720
Have you seen my physics book?

211
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,940
Baal, just like a Maya
Can't do natural acting.

212
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,000
Nithya .... Nithya ....

213
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,320
Nithya of "B" Row ...

214
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,350
Nithya .... Nithya ....

215
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,570
I left my book in your car, Nithya.

216
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,690
(Varun and Nithiya during school)

217
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:39,690
This ... Nithya ...

218
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Sorry dude ... it was just fun ...

219
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,540
He didn't see, promise

220
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,570
Please, friend ... don't be angry ...

221
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,090
Nithya ...

222
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,610
hey, Nithya ...

223
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,940
I didn't tell you,
he's so cute ...

224
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,360
Shut up ... shut up ...

225
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,790
Relax ...
he can be cute, handsome to you ...

226
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,410
But to me he is an ass.

227
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,630
Our mothers are always from whom
100 hands away ...

228
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,660
he is from Qatar.

229
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,780
And you know what,

230
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,310
the guys who brought coffee with our girls
We are waiting for him ...

231
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,430
he's that kind of guy

232
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,250
So do you know him?
- You know him? -You know him?

233
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,150
hey ... what's his name?

234
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,570
the girl is Katie (hot), Mama. Isn't it ??

235
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,100
Okay ... okay ... okay ...

236
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,020
I know the girl.

237
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,140
Super ... what is her name ???

238
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,370
If you know her,
But why not go and talk to her?

239
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,090
Excuse me ...
(Excuse me ...)

240
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,420
Bye ... see you ....
-By ...

241
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,840
Yes, tell me ...

242
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
You don't sleep

243
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,190
"Chikkad Palli Alok Nanda Apartment" ...
You stay in C-Block.

244
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:15,610
Oh ... sorry ... I'm Varun ... Varun Krishna.
We used to play sports together.

245
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,040
Don't recognize me?

246
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,060
We were friends then,
I almost always went to your house.

247
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,080
Made by your mother's hand
I used to like to eat puri with broth;

248
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,610
And we used to draw a picture together.

249
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,030
What happened then ???

250
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,360
then why don't we talk anymore?

251
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,480
Did you get new friends?

252
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,700
hey, nothing like that ...
Your family left.

253
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,630
What was the reason for not talking to us?

254
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,350
No, not because ...

255
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
But I think you know the reason ...

256
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,000
Anyway, we'll talk later ...

257
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,620
What was it ???????
- What?

258
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,650
Did I hear all this?

259
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:11,570
What happened 10 years ago,
Are you taking revenge for that?

260
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,800
Why did you do that ??  so sad ...

261
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,820
Seven years ... you know what?

262
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,340
the true nature of man never changes.

263
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,070
he was an idiot before and still has an idiot.

264
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,590
What about your character?

265
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,920
Say whatever comes to your mind ???

266
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
Were you like that seven years ago ???

267
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,260
Ooooo ... she looks cute now
Talking about his side, isn't it?

268
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,890
You've known me for 5 years ...

269
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,610
But you know nothing about him.

270
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
Nithya, we're kind of you
I'm not interrogating ...

271
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,660
We know you hate him.

272
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,080
And we know, Seto bought coffee for us
Not even a boy to feed like this.- Let's go ...

273
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,110
Exactly, he's not coffee type boy.

274
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,930
What are you doing?

275
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,860
the question was very straightforward, Jenny.
- Did you let me copy?

276
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,980
hey, where's Nithya?

277
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,100
- Why did you do that?
You could tell the truth, sir.

278
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:05,430
I could tell, but how?
I couldn't think of that.

279
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,150
Actually I didn't lie ...

280
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,580
I wanted to help you,
That's what I was trying to do.

281
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Sir saw.

282
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,620
No, you lied.

283
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,850
You didn't ask me ....

284
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,670
You could tell sir,
I asked you a question.

285
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
It doesn't matter.

286
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,820
I lied to my brother that day.

287
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,040
I really should have said that
"I want you."

288
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,670
Okay, we'll talk later ....

289
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,590
What happened? Hmm?
- okay, he's cute.

290
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,820
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?

291
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,760
One minute ...

292
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,180
then, on the last day ... "Same Pinch" ...

293
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,000
Look ... NIthya has gone there.

294
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,530
Best of luck with the test ...

295
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,650
You too ...

296
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,280
Thank you ....

297
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,700
Celebrate it at the end of the test
Let's meet afterwards?

298
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,620
That means you are very confident
You will pass in all subjects.

299
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,950
We have more history
Not having to read the geography para ...

300
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,770
That is why we should celebrate.

301
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
(Jantus and Hasis na re ....
Pin Murray in the heart ...)

302
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,620
Let's have tea / coffee .. ??

303
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,940
I will pay the bill today ....

304
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,170
All right ...

305
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,290
Wait for me ok. He asked to drink coffee.

306
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,020
Coffee !!!!!!!!

307
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Brother, a Horlicks

308
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,260
Coffee ...

309
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,190
See you at the end of the test?

310
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,210
In fact, on holidays
I'll go out, I won't stay here.

311
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,440
Actually, I'm going home too ....

312
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,660
I'll be back in a week.

313
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,980
Annavaram, my village.

314
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,510
Greenery .. Horizon field .. Very beautiful ..
I like it a lot.

315
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,030
Have you ever been

316
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,660
Is that so? Come once ... very beautiful village.
Where will you go on holiday?

317
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,680
Australia ......

318
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
then ... when will you be back?

319
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,030
Actually I won't be here on holiday ...

320
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,050
the day the test ends
That night we are leaving.

321
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,380
About next year's academic time,
Mother has spoken to the principal.
(About when class will start)

322
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,600
We'll be back when the school opens.

323
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,020
Straight Intern ...

324
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,150
Where are you going in Australia?

325
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,470
I will travel all over Australia.

326
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,700
Melbourne ??? !!!!

327
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,520
Hmmm ... my uncle lives there.

328
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,540
We will go there first. Why?

329
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,370
I know a girl over there.
Can you meet her

330
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,390
Pretty girl
My very good Facebook friend.

331
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,520
But I don't know that she
Where Melbourne's Exxon is located.

332
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,140
Finding her will not be so difficult.

333
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:26,760
Because, when she thinks of something ...
then she started chewing the pen ....

334
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,990
when she laughs, it looks like someone is escaping
Going into the classroom on a motorcycle.

335
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,610
(Slightly rural language Escarap- means
Scrap- Bhangura / Bhangri)
(We use this term more in Noakhali)

336
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,340
If you fight with her...

337
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,460
she never measures us ...
Until, we hug her feet.

338
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,180
I think I know her.

339
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,010
A perfect match.

340
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,530
Can you tell her ...

341
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,360
There's a boy in Hyderabad
that misses her.

342
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,680
I will wait for her to return.

343
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,300
Tell her to move a little with the speed of a meteor.

344
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,930
All right. I'm hungry

345
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,850
Brother, 2 samoas ... 4 butter biscuits ...

346
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
I ordered, so I'll pay ...

347
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Listen, whenever we meet,
I'll pay. All right?

348
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,120
hey, what are you doing here?

349
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,650
What ????

350
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,270
Don't be afraid.

351
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,700
I will not tell anyone that
I'm here for you.

352
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,220
You don't tell anyone. Hmm?

353
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,340
Nithya ......

354
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:02,770
then ......

355
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,990
Congratulations ... the student leader of the school ... (Class Captain)

356
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,220
Thank you ....

357
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,740
Deepak is older than you at school
they have chosen Deep.

358
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,560
they said you are a fresher.
I asked the principal.

359
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,090
hey, please ...

360
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,210
I have no interest in these competitions.

361
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,640
Even if they gave me free, I would not agree.

362
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,060
People like "Khan helal"
Wants to be noticed, it's for them.

363
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,980
I don't need this kind of talent.

364
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,710
Listen, I'm talking about Deepak,
But not about you.

365
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,830
You have spoken your mind.

366
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,560
At least, for me though, you
Can't pretend to be happy ??

367
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,680
Is being a class captain a big deal?
It's just a badge. (Symbol / title)

368
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,000
she has completely forgotten me.

369
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,230
Let me down home;
Lunch together ...

370
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,850
Even, him all day
Can't even see ...

371
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,180
I changed my school.

372
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
What is this for?

373
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,620
Have you?

374
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,250
I thought you were gone.

375
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:34,770
I thought I was gone, or
I thought it would be nice if I left.

376
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,300
Go now?

377
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,520
No, it will take me another half hour.

378
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,940
Just like that, it's 4:30.

379
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:45,770
You said you have a deadline.

380
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,990
If you have time to have fun
If need be, you can tell me.

381
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,410
I'll wait half an hour.

382
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,940
- Varun !!!
- Nithya, I'm coming from the classroom.

383
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,060
-hello ...

384
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,690
there is no need to be so polite,

385
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,710
You can sit here and talk to Nithya.

386
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,230
You don't have to go.

387
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,160
What the hell was that?

388
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,380
I don't understand ...

389
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,410
You tell me ...

390
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,030
You acted like an idiot

391
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,050
How could you do that?

392
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,080
And, that's where I'm working
How to order to leave?

393
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,700
That means you make me yours
Want to prove yourself as a maid?

394
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,130
Ooooooooo ......

395
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,350
This is the real story, isn't it?

396
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,470
I won't tell you that,
Why did I tell Deepak ...

397
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,300
Deepak ...

398
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,720
Too big ... too big car ...
Holiday celebrations in famous places ...

399
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,750
One minute ...

400
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,670
he is just like you.

401
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,690
You are the captain of the students,
he is the captain of the students.

402
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
when the two of you make such a perfect match ...

403
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,740
With fools like me,
Why are you wasting your time?

404
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:47,970
Is that so ...

405
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,790
How could you say that?
I didn't expect that from you.

406
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,910
So you mean me and Deepak?

407
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
No need to act.

408
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,860
I'm not saying ... everyone at school is saying ...

409
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,290
How you spend time with him and laugh at his jokes.

410
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,810
How close you are to Divya
Moving on, even though she knows everything ...

411
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,030
I didn't tell you anything.
-Oh ... please ...

412
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,050
Don't bullshit me with these stories. 
It's not the same

413
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,780
there is nothing between us ...

414
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,500
That's it, I know there's nothing wrong with you.

415
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,130
when you were with Divya, I never thought
No, you two have a love affair.

416
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,550
then you think such nonsense
How can you think?

417
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,770
when a girl looks at you and laughs a little,
What do you think, she loves you?

418
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,100
And that's exactly what I said,
Do you understand that you are feeling different?

419
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,920
Okay ... I agree .........

420
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,950
We will solve it by talking.
To prevent this from happening again, come on ...

421
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,070
Why don't you understand
I can't come now.

422
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,090
I have a job now.

423
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,220
the same thing over and over again
How many more times will I tell you ...

424
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,540
I have a lot of work to do ...

425
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,370
Is the work so important?

426
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,890
Deepak is there to take care of you, isn't he?

427
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,410
I just told you that,
We will go home together. Can't hear?

428
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Nithya ...

429
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
Decide now ...

430
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,390
I can't wait for you anymore.

431
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,510
If you go in now ......

432
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,030
then our relationship ends here.

433
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,860
Do you want him or me?

434
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,680
You decide, ...

435
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,100
Where do I go from you?

436
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,120
Have you exceeded your limits?

437
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,150
Simply put ...

438
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:32,420
Whether I go in or stay with you,
there is no relationship between you and me.

439
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,450
Our relationship ends here ...

440
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,570
All right ...

441
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
But remember ............

442
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
... you're breaking up.

443
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:22,640
(when Varun Nithiya was 20 years old)

444
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,940
So you've finally upgraded

445
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,370
Have you changed from  Horlicks to coffee?

446
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,890
You too have changed ....

447
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,420
You have become a beautiful lady.

448
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,440
You are now a "lady", Nithya.

449
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,060
Yesterday, Jenny found me
It's good to have.

450
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:57,690
the way she ran towards me,
the water in my liver had dried up.

451
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,710
the way the name shouted; I thought,
You sent him to kill me ...

452
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,040
You're right, she always told me
Mainka squeezes and throws.

453
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
But to be honest ...

454
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,380
I sent you my number
Upon learning, my friends were shocked.

455
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:14,010
there was a lot of babbling.

456
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,330
But in this case, I do not think so
Talking to a stranger.

457
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,060
Looks like I'm mine
I found an old friend.

458
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,480
That's why you forbade me to go to coaching?

459
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
Meetings are being held here every day, aren't they?

460
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,530
Girlfriend or not?
-Part from here.

461
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:42,550
Hi, I'm awesome. Varun's younger brother.
You can call me Appu.

462
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,180
- Hi, I'm Nithya.
- Hi.

463
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Road size .........

464
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,320
A few years later we met,
And you got caught and eaten !!!!

465
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,750
I'm having a bad time ...

466
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,170
hey, share it ....

467
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,400
- You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?
- Hmm.

468
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,920
- You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?
- Hmmmmm ...

469
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,940
That means you are public with a few hundred coins in your pocket
Were you in love in front of the telephone booth?

470
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,170
A lot like that ......

471
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:18,090
hey, you're the same every day
Didn't you leave after the shirt again?

472
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,520
In fact, I do that for our festival
I bought the clothes, that's what I went after.

473
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,440
- Did you go to his college?
- Hmmm ...

474
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,260
- Villa Mary?
- Hmmm ...

475
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:29,290
Women's college?
- Hmmm ...

476
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,510
Inside the college ???????

477
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,140
Inside the college ...

478
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,260
College Gate ......

479
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,980
In fact, a lot can be said outside of college.

480
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:43,310
That means everything is the same as before,
No change, isn't it ???

481
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:50,430
In these three years, she has been to America ...

482
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,460
Went to Africa, and what about Malta
Don't have a country? Went there.

483
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,780
But where did I go?
Annavaram, Simhachalam ...

484
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,100
Why are you thinking so much?
she hasn't married anyone yet. Isn't it?

485
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,130
- That ...
- Dude, get cold ...

486
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,750
Well, Malta is next to Vijaywadar, isn't it?

487
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,180
No no no no no .........

488
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,700
Why would you call?

489
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,620
Nithya, let him call ...

490
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,050
Girls, I mean ... believe me ...

491
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,870
His friends will tell him so
Without calling you

492
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,700
This will confuse him.
But I will not do that.

493
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,120
You call ...

494
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?

495
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:33,270
You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?

496
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:35,690
Not at all.

497
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,920
I think school life is over there
It is better not to talk about what happened.

498
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,640
- Aren't we both adults now?
- Hmm, that's right ...

499
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,060
We are both adults.

500
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,090
About any of our past
No need to talk anymore.

501
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,710
Well, how is Deepak?

502
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,140
Deepak is fine ...

503
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,560
the car is unstable, Nithya.

504
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,580
Within half the time of the college bus
I'll get home.

505
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:09,610
But you can't come every day.

506
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,630
In fact, to pick you up every day,
I will set fire to the publishing house again.

507
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,660
"Did you go on a long drive ??"

508
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,580
And, your father would be surprised to know
Maybe you are paying diesel from pocket money.

509
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:29,200
Please, Varun ... I like it very much.
the two of us are spending some time together.
That's not a problem.

510
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,030
Look no further ...

511
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:36,850
Red signal for the first time in my life
And it's nice to see traffic jams.

512
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,280
Sorry, I didn't remember that today was Sunday,
And there will be so much crowd here.

513
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,100
No problem,

514
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:50,900
This is the main thing we sat down to eat together.
Where to eat, that's the main thing.
I'm not having any problems.

515
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,920
there was no problem even if there was more crowd.

516
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,940
Looks like you're in flower form?

517
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:12,270
the crowd wants it, doesn't it? there's a family there
Waiting, will I call them?

518
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,490
here ??

519
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,120
Call them. they will sit on the side.

520
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,040
Appu, lying down pretending to be asleep.

521
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,560
Varun ...

522
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,590
- What happened?
- I'm talking from the bathroom.

523
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:32,910
Nithya ...

524
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,140
What about your dad's phone
Asked something?

525
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,660
Don't worry. she will buy a new one.

526
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,280
Bill will come, won't she?

527
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,710
Varun ... I'll see if then ...

528
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,730
Right now, with you
Talking is the main thing now.

529
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,360
I said someone took one.
I did not lie anymore.

530
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,780
- Nithya ...
- What? ...

531
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,100
Nothing ...

532
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,230
Our gang is very big.
We always have fun together.

533
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:15,750
Varun, why do you have only one friend?
Can't find any more friends?

534
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,180
I can do it all alone.

535
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,500
hey ... no ... no ... I didn't mean that.
I didn't even talk about size.

536
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,120
I wanted to talk about friendship.

537
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,050
By that I mean ...

538
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,670
I mean ... your thing
I mean my thing ... my thing means ...

539
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,300
All right, man. It seems to me
Time is running out. I'm going ...

540
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
Reveal ... they are joking ... please ...

541
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,440
Okay, what's the problem?

542
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:40,170
Today is Jenny's birthday. Focus on him.

543
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,190
- My birthday? Super ...
- Let me go. Please ...

544
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,920
My ... my birthday ...
Thank you ...

545
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,940
What a friend. What a joke

546
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,660
hey, you pay attention to the bond.
Mysore Bonda (to be explained later)

547
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:58,290
Mysore Bonda is a Telugu snack.
It's a bit crispy / crispy on top though
the inside is very soft and hollow.

548
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,710
the ingredients used to make it are:
Flour, Ginger, Chili, Oil, Butter Milk etc.

549
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,340
It's raining cats and dogs ...

550
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:15,060
Wow ... in a word,
You look restless, Nithya.

551
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,880
- You look handsome too, you know?
- Thank you.

552
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,110
the credit for this is yours !!!

553
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,730
My father is so expensive and beautiful clothes like me
I was surprised to think that any friend of the boy could give.

554
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,860
Appu was coughing all the time when she heard this.

555
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,180
I will leave him with a lesson.

556
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,800
So, you're your dad
No sense in telling you now - I don't wanna ruin the surprise.

557
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:59,030
there must be an umbrella in the car, right?

558
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:05,850
Call Rohini and tell her to bring an umbrella.
It doesn't look like the rain will stop.

559
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,980
It is better not to stop.

560
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Nithya, on your birthday
Rohini is giving this party.

561
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,820
That's it, my birthday
I should spend it as I wish.

562
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:26,050
All right, your wish.
Say whatever comes to mind ...

563
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,170
<b> <i> "I Love You", Varun. </b> </i>

564
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,600
I really love you

565
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,620
You have nothing to say?

566
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,740
- I told you, didn't I? It's ...
- What ???

567
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:37,670
Didn't say that ...

568
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,100
I'm in psychology now,
Going to be a bachelor's degree holder.

569
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,720
Please, Varun ...

570
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,140
Don't listen to me. What are you
Do you really know what you want to do in the future?

571
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:26,970
This is the advantage of studying in engineering ...

572
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,090
How do you want to spend the rest of your life?
Know, give you an extra year.

573
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,820
You too have finished your studies, and
You do not know what to do?

574
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,140
I haven't thought about it yet, Varun.

575
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,160
I don't really know that
Which profession would I enjoy?

576
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,290
Honestly, I know ...

577
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,610
One thing ...

578
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,940
That's you ...

579
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:04,860
when to meet you, when to spend time,
All these days are spent in these thoughts.

580
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,280
You are the only source of happiness in my whole life.

581
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,710
Oh, Edinburgh ???

582
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,430
This ... egg ... or ... ra ...

583
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,460
Say again

584
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,680
This ... egg ... or ... ra ...

585
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,800
Scotland ...

586
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:24,030
Oops, London ...

587
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:31,150
What about your father for his three daughters?
Don't need a bodyguard? Shall I apply?

588
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:32,370
That would be nice ...

589
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:36,490
My sister is not with me, in fact.
I would have taken you, to be honest.

590
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:44,020
As long as she's here,
This is by no means possible.

591
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,340
We can't meet.

592
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,770
I will miss you a lot ...

593
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:54,090
I will miss you too ....

594
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:57,110
I don't know what to do.

595
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,140
then come with me ...

596
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,860
Ummm ... you can do one thing ...

597
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,690
I mean, in this ... egg ... or ... ra ...
there is a girl.

598
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,910
Tell him a boy
Going crazy for her.

599
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,930
Will you tell her,
To leave a little early.

600
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,060
- I'll tell you ...

601
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,280
I'll let him know
I will tell you to leave soon.

602
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:29,410
Must be without him for three months ...

603
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:33,330
This is my condition on the 5th day, then
What will happen to me on the 75th day?

604
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,050
Everything is the same,
Just without Her presence.

605
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,980
But it seems to me,
Everything seems to have changed.

606
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,100
I want to escape the pain of missing him
I tried to be busy but I couldn't.

607
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,830
That's when you miss the salwar kameez
Remember the trousers and pants?

608
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:49,850
What do you mean?

609
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:52,270
when your pathi is not in town,
then come to your friend, right?

610
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:56,100
That guy, love you anymore
Do not eat. But I will eat.

611
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,920
Look, Khasir Biryani ... just in time.
Start eating ...

612
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:04,050
the day she left me,

613
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:08,370
In this place (stomach)
How empty it feels.

614
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:12,190
At first I didn't understand why.

615
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,720
I realized later that she was mine
It seems that there is no side.

616
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,740
This has never happened to me before.

617
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:20,770
It's not a feeling of love, Ray.
It feels gas ...

618
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,990
From the "Baba Hotel" outside our college
This will be the case every day.

619
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:26,810
It's not just that you're feeling this way.
Everyone is feeling the same thing.

620
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,940
"Baba Hotel Special"

621
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,560
Sir then woke up ....

622
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:37,090
Gita, for our Nawabzada
Give me a cup of hot coffee.

623
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,510
Woke up so early today?
What's the matter, sir?

624
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:45,730
- Puspa anti ....
- Aunt Puspa ???

625
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,550
Good morning ... Screaming in the morning ...

626
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,680
It's noon for him. But
For me, it's dawn ...

627
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,200
So, today will be a good day for you.

628
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:59,330
hey, did you brush?
- I'm done taking a bath. Give me coffee, mother.

629
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,050
here you go ...

630
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,370
- Dad, what did you say ...
- Interview ....

631
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,300
Interview ...? Not today, Sunday?

632
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,620
Did you get the job?

633
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:19,650
What from "295 Solution"
Did you take it out in the meantime?

634
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:24,370
Well whatever, no job
Will give interview now.

635
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:25,990
For an important person ...

636
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:28,020
Important ... full ...

637
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,340
Mom, what did you do that? ......

638
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,960
there is no possibility of employment.
If something like that had happened, they would not have taken him so easily.

639
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:44,580
If they want to hire him,
Must be interviewed at least 18 times. Confirm.

640
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,610
- she means ...
- hey, will you go with us?

641
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:48,930
- I want size, I want prayers too ......, mother.

642
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,860
when you sing false praises in His name,
I can't sit there anymore.

643
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,780
- My son is as handsome as Allu Arjun.
- That's it.

644
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,000
My son is very smart.
My son is very hardworking.

645
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,030
To marry a girl to my son
How many parents are wandering behind.

646
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,050
That's it ... going backwards ...

647
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,880
the problem is not there, mother. the problem is,
If the girl likes me ???

648
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,900
Take a look at Mahday ...
In the meanwhile 12 faces have been played.

649
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,920
Not getting ready ????

650
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:25,950
hey, where is everyone in the house?
I saw my father's scooter on the ground floor.

651
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:31,170
they left long ago.
there seems to be a problem.

652
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,900
What happened?

653
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,920
Didn't she like you?

654
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,940
You can wash good clothes
I can clean a good pot too.
You should have told them that.

655
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,970
What, brother, are you failing?

656
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:54,990
You have 16 more opportunities.

657
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,820
there is a system of supplementary testing, Ray Pagla,
No tension.

658
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:07,140
I thought you knew the girl well.

659
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,060
It's my fault ...

660
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:12,190
I liked this girl.
she used to work with me.

661
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,210
I liked him
And she liked me too.

662
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:21,040
I told my mother about it and I told my father,
Talk to his parents.

663
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,160
I thought, no problem.

664
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,880
I never thought they would
Expect something from me.

665
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:30,010
I get paid 20,000 rupees more than him.

666
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:34,130
But, when his father is ours
Insulting family status ...

667
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,160
she did not say a word.

668
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,180
I will marry such a girl,
That is our house, you and Appu will accept.

669
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
Even if this girl is gone
I no longer borrow these things.

670
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,930
But I hurt my father.
That's why I feel bad.

671
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,250
I know Ray, I'm not an intelligent boy.

672
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,180
And I know this, I'm better than this job
I will not get a good job.

673
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,100
I can't change this house anymore.

674
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:07,920
But at least that's what they wanted
So that no one gets hurt because of me.

675
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,950
And today I could not do that.

676
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,570
hey ... you know, more than all of us
Dad loves you so much.

677
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,200
- That ...
- Listen to this ...

678
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,120
At least, you and Appu Baba
Try to keep happy.

679
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,040
That ...

680
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:30,570
Is your head damaged? What happened to you?
I'm talking to my mother ...

681
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,590
Mom ...

682
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:45,810
Why are you all so dizzy?

683
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,230
Have you talked to Harish?

684
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,960
I don't know what to say to him.

685
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,780
she must be having a lot of tension.

686
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,610
We are at the root of all problems ...

687
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:13,030
Your father never said anything insulting to anyone.
But today, everyone is pointing fingers at him ...

688
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,050
they were saying, our financial situation
Must be better.

689
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,080
Don't go and sit with your father.

690
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,400
I'm so scared of your dad ...

691
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:31,130
If anyone insults him,
I'm in a lot of trouble, Ray.

692
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:34,050
Go and talk to your father once.

693
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:42,770
Come on, Varun ...

694
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,800
I understand your mother sent?

695
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,620
One thing to know ...

696
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:04,550
To take care of you,
Your father is still alive.

697
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:07,170
You don't have to worry about me.

698
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:09,190
hey Dad, forget all this ...

699
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,220
Who are they to talk to you like that?

700
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,640
What happened again today?

701
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:18,370
they said it was like marrying their daughter
We are not the right family.

702
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:20,790
That's it ....

703
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,510
they also have the right to express their views.

704
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,240
I have a good job
Expect a boy ...

705
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:35,160
there are three flats for three brothers,
To expect such a family ...

706
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:37,090
I can't be angry with them anymore ...

707
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,810
But so to speak, my own to me
Doesn't seem inferior in any part.

708
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:43,830
I'm me ...

709
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,260
I don't need to be like them.

710
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:52,080
I have made my three sons human,
This makes me very proud.

711
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:54,010
What else do I want?

712
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:56,030
Come on, everyone come eat.
(Dinner)

713
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:01,050
I'm still your mother
I couldn't take it to Singapore ....

714
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,380
Who wants to go to Singapore again?

715
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,100
You want it!

716
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:09,130
This is the condition of your mother to me
Agreed to get married!

717
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,150
All lies ...

718
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:13,670
That ...

719
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,100
Harish has suffered a lot.
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either.

720
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,220
I'm taking a bath ...

721
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,450
My mother is in pain, so my brother is in pain.

722
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:51,570
Dad is in trouble, so Mom is in trouble.

723
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:53,590
My brother is in pain, so my father is in pain.

724
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:58,820
Everyone tries from their own place
Doing, to please each other.

725
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,940
What did I do?

726
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:04,570
Have I done anything so far?

727
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:06,890
Dad ...

728
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:10,110
Nothing has changed in our house in the last 10 years
Whether it happened or not, I did not notice.

729
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,240
the reason is - "you"!

730
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,060
That scooter, that sofa ...

731
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:19,090
Somehow managed with paper under the poles
I haven't even noticed the broken dining table so far.

732
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:21,610
Managed so well,
I didn't notice.

733
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:39,330
You have done so much for us, father.

734
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,160
I want to do something for you and my mother.

735
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,480
the experience of getting on your first flight
I want to be the reason behind it.

736
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:53,810
*** 2 months later ***

737
01:07:57,130 --> 01:07:58,530
What's the problem?

738
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:07,550
- hey, handsome ...
- Nithya !!!

739
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,780
Do you need a lift?

740
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,400
Surprise ...

741
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,230
How is my father's new gift?

742
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,250
For me ...

743
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,270
Which means it's about to be the most delusional time of the year, as well.

744
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,100
Won't you continue?
Why are you sitting here

745
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,720
Of course ... but not today ....

746
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:33,850
Your father bought it for you.

747
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:36,870
It won't look good if I drive.

748
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:39,390
Because she bought it
I asked him for it.

749
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,720
What happened, Varun?

750
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:44,840
Anyway, are you with me?
Did you notice any changes?

751
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:47,170
No ...

752
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,790
Something new ???

753
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:55,410
I cut my hair!

754
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:58,040
Oops !! You cut your hair short?

755
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,060
No no ... I have made my hair bigger ....

756
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,290
Come on, Varun !!

757
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:06,210
All right, hurry up; Where do you want to have dinner?

758
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:07,730
Have dinner ????

759
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:11,160
How long can it take? Because ...
I have to get home by nine o'clock.

760
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,680
What happened to you !!!!!

761
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,110
What does this 9 o'clock reporting mean?

762
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:19,330
Let's go

763
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,950
All right, I'll drop you off at 9 o'clock.

764
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,280
How can I tell you, Nithya?

765
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:28,700
Although or say; So what do I say to you?

766
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:31,130
Shall I tell you,
I'm not worthy of you.

767
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:34,950
What shall I say; My duties and hardships
I can't share with you.

768
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:44,670
I'm so sorry, Nithya.

769
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,200
I was trapped ...

770
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,320
An emergency ...

771
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:51,450
It doesn't matter ...

772
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:55,070
Nithya, I want to tell you something.

773
01:09:57,090 --> 01:10:00,790
This November, I'm going to take the CAT exam.

774
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:05,120
In the meantime, I’ve been admitted to coaching.
And I decided that what I really needed to do was learn how to do it right.

775
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:09,040
Other friends in my batch a month ago
Started. I'm late.

776
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:12,870
That's why I'm late
Which means it's about to be the most delusional time of the year, as well.

777
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:15,690
Oops! This matter? You too
You scared me.

778
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:17,910
I thought you were something serious
Want to discuss.

779
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,940
This is a serious matter, Nithya.

780
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,160
hey, I didn't mean that.
You understand, don't you?

781
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:27,790
But when did you make that decision?

782
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:31,510
You want to do MBA, in this regard
You've never said anything before,

783
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:35,030
If you tell me, maybe I'm with you
I would have been admitted in MBA class.

784
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,660
No, Nithya.
Until you need it.

785
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,080
You'll be there, won't you?

786
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,810
Let's go ...

787
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:17,530
All is well ...

788
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:19,050
Aren't your parents thinking?

789
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:21,780
Sad but true, no such thing
Suddenly the news did not come to me.

790
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,100
If my parents think, then
Will think about my marriage.

791
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:36,130
Fortunately, I'm looking into the matter.
Isn't that so, Varun?

792
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,450
You haven't gotten married yet.

793
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:42,770
And, before you ...
Vidya must be married, not so.

794
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:03,500
We met many days later, and
You say it will be gone in an hour.

795
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,520
You came to eat, didn't you?

796
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,220
I thought you loved the place.

797
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:20,650
It's too late today, if you don't want to come tell me ...

798
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,170
It's so hard to get this ticket
there was no need.

799
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,490
This is the first time in a whole month
I came to see the movie.

800
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,520
Only for you ...

801
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:30,640
For me ?? !!!!
there is no need for me to suffer so much.

802
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:43,170
Varun ...

803
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:46,490
You are the same as before
Don't talk to me ...

804
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:49,310
I am alone with the car
I am wandering around like crazy.

805
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:54,440
You call ... text ...
See you ... I'm waiting for that.

806
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,460
Do not rely on him.

807
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:01,790
he could be your boyfriend ...
he may be the man you love ...

808
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,010
But he is yours
Nothing more than life.

809
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,530
Happy birthday :)

810
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,560
Thanks ...

811
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,680
Looks so beautiful ... as always ...

812
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:40,810
I really miss you so much ...

813
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:46,130
- You look so tired ...
- Nothing like that ...

814
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:47,550
Actually ......

815
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:52,680
That's what I'm going to say
You may get upset.

816
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,400
But I have to leave in an hour.
You know my CAT exam the day after tomorrow.

817
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:00,830
Please, don't be angry ...

818
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:17,550
You passed the CAT exam.

819
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:19,870
I'm really happy ...

820
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,500
Everything will be normal from tomorrow, right?

821
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:27,420
I wish we were as happy as before ...

822
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,550
there was a time when I used to do whatever I wanted
You like that

823
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:39,270
You don't like what I do now.

824
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:41,290
I can't live like you, Nithya ...

825
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,520
Someone seems very happy today!

826
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:00,940
Looks like no to me
You have called for good news.

827
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,570
All my obstacles are gone, Nithya.

828
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:11,790
I finally got a seat at IIM.
(IIM: Indian Institute of Management) (Every year 20 autonomous educational institutions under this organization collect their 1550 students through much more competitive CAT exams. Last year more than 2 lakh candidates took part in this exam.)

829
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:13,110
I have passed all the rounds.

830
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:18,540
I did it, Nithya.
Kozhikode - Kerala ... I'm coming ...

831
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:27,460
Kerala !!!!!

832
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:28,890
Hmmm ...

833
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:30,310
Kerala.

834
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:32,530
In the next three months ...

835
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:37,460
I know, it didn't happen in the top row colleges,
But still it is called IIM.

836
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:40,380
You know, I'm at the coaching center
I was admitted too late.

837
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:45,510
hey, we both knew that would happen, wouldn't we?

838
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:50,530
Honestly, I am
In fact, I did not think about it.

839
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:55,050
What do you mean? You think
I will not be selected, right?

840
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:58,170
hey, that's not it, I knew you would be selected.

841
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:03,400
But, you will go so far
I never thought of that.

842
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,420
Varun, I'm with you.

843
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:09,550
I want you to do whatever you want in life.

844
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:26,470
Varun, I can come with you. Isn't it?

845
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:27,490
Kerala ...

846
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,220
Why didn't it come to my head for so long?

847
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:34,440
I have no job there or
I can come up with a course.

848
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:37,070
I can easily convince my father.

849
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:39,590
Besides, Vidya is also letting Apu study outside.

850
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,610
You're happy, aren't you?

851
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:48,940
So, what do you want, every night you
Take me to my hostel, like Lytton's flat.

852
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,560
Will you stay in the hostel?

853
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:55,590
Because that's all I can do.

854
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:58,510
Please Varun ...

855
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:00,630
We will rent an apartment.

856
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,160
I'll rent two. All right?

857
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,380
No, not at all, Nithya.
Why do you hire me ...

858
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:08,010
Will you pay my rent ?????

859
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:10,730
And, that's just the thing here
Not within my means (budget).

860
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:14,250
the problem is not there, Nithya.
I am going to study there.

861
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:17,180
Everyone has to be on campus.
No one can stay out.

862
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,700
Don't you want me to go

863
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:26,930
Alas God ... !!!

864
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:29,350
So, you don't want me either?

865
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:32,070
I want you, Nithya.

866
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,200
But for no ajaira purpose
I don't want you to go there.

867
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,920
If you also want to apply,
And to pass, but I would be very happy.

868
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:41,550
It's too late .........

869
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:43,970
when I wanted to apply,
then you agreed.

870
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,490
Because that was not your goal.
You wanted to be admitted for me.

871
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:51,020
Because I want you !!
here, what is my crime?

872
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:51,840
Crime? !!!

873
01:17:54,370 --> 01:17:56,370
I am not qualified to take such a big responsibility, Nithya.

874
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:01,490
If you make every decision in your life is mine
Take it to heart then one day you will hate me.

875
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,610
I can't let that happen.

876
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:06,140
I always tell you to do something.

877
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,760
That will keep you busy and happy ....

878
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:12,190
Did you want it for me

879
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:15,110
Or did you want it for yourself?

880
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:19,330
when I'm busy with my life,

881
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,260
Behind the fact that you are changing like this
I will try to reduce the fault of my neck, right?

882
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:32,780
I haven't changed, Nithya.

883
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:35,210
I just opened my eyes.

884
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:36,830
I have learned to understand my responsibility.

885
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:39,950

I was shocked to see the stage.

886

- Where's the mistake ???

887
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,100
You opened your eyes, Varun.

888
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:51,430
But you left me in the same place as before.

889
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:00,450
I am doing all this for my family.

890
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:03,970
You know how important it is for me.
I want to do it for them (family).

891
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,700
You are very lucky, Nithya!

892
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,420
You can follow your dreams.

893
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:14,650
What else do you want?

894
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:17,970
I have a lot of pressure, a lot of responsibility.
Please .........

895
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:20,090
Oops ... stop ...

896
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:26,720
You're talking like I'm a bad student,
Even if you dip it in water, you will not be able to swallow it.

897
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,140
You insulted me ...

898
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:30,170
I know who I am.
Thank you very much.

899

Did you forget

900
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:39,810
In every debate competition
I would be the first.

901

Did you forget that

902
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,360
My life was so happy!

903
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:52,590
From the word "my" when "our"
the word came, everything changed !!!

904
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:56,410
when you were busy,
I was alone then.

905
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:58,930
And to accept the sacrifice for you ...

906
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:02,660

I have moved away from everyone.

Do you know a thing

909
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:13,830
I hear the word "no" in my mouth
My friends stopped calling me.

910

the two of us to maintain the relationship
One of them has to accept the sacrifice ...

911
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,780
So I accepted the sacrifice.

912
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:29,400
- I never told you anything because ...
- then why are you telling me now? Why?

913
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:34,230
I didn't tell you to do that ...

914
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:37,350
I always told you to go out
And do something yourself.

915
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:39,870
Honestly, like Jenny, your friend,
So is my friend ....

916
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,900
Not being able to give friends time
Blame it on me?

917

I'm not blaming you, Varun.

918

1022
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:45,870
It's not her fault

1023
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:48,290
I told her not to tell you.

1024
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,120
In fact, you never know
Don't let us come.

1025
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,340
I will wait for you

1026
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:54,960
Cool down your anger
I'll wait until then.

1027
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:56,790
Not just today ...

1028
01:31:57,510 --> 01:31:59,310
I will wait here every day from now on.

1029
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:01,140
I want to talk to you Nithya.

1030
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,560
I'm not leaving without talking.

1031
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,180
- Prakash ...
- What's up ...

1032
01:32:08,510 --> 01:32:09,510
Let's go ...

1033
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:11,930
Oi ... oi ... oi ... this way ...

1034
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,460
Kiri boy, she told me to go to shell.

1035
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:25,680
Much like that.

1036
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,800
Shameless self-promotion for Ballistic Products and a great bargain on a neat little knife for you.
I can't go without talking.

1037
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:30,330
I don't like the thing, Ray.

1038
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:33,150
You, like him, would say,
"Go away and die, the smell is running."

1039
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:34,980
If I say, "Go away and die."
I would go home then ...

1040
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
My own or ... without tears
there was no more work.

1041
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:41,420
Oops ...

1042
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:43,950
You met in college 3 years later ...

1043
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:47,570
After seeing each other, you cling like a feminist
I started talking and then I fell in love again.

1044
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,600
I thought something like that would happen this time.

1045
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,920
Honestly, this girl is the nation
It is very difficult to understand.

1046
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,040
Well, how long have you been saying?
Wait here? 10 days?

1047
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:59,470
I'll wait 20 days ...

1048
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:00,690
Do I have to wait?

1049
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:02,920
It's a matter of my life.
Can't wait?

1050
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:03,940
the thing is ...

1051
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:08,360
Listen, a hero is like "Tolly Prema"
Requested to hear Cute Love Story.

1052
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:11,090
I have to go tell him the story.

1053
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:12,410
Who is the hero?

1054
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,940
R. Narayan idol.

1055
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:17,360
(R. Narayan Murthy is an actor from India,
Director, composer, singer, and producer)

1056
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:26,780
Nithya, left everything and came here.
*** That one girl is my friend ***

1057
01:33:27,410 --> 01:33:29,410
Jenny told me about him last night.

1058
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:32,330
Nithya has been here for the last 6 months.

1059
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,060
she came here exactly 2 months after the tsunami.

1060
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,180
Since then she has been set here.

1061
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,300
During this time, she only went home once.

1062
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:41,530
she's been here a year ...

1063
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:44,350
Only after the school is set up properly
she decided to go home.

1064
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:47,580
Oh, I think to convince him
It will take another year. .

1065
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:51,400
Until then, you have to wait here.
I will come and see you from time to time.

1066
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,120
Jenny, you can stay here.

1067
01:33:58,150 --> 01:33:59,550
In fact, only a few rooms are empty.

1068
01:33:59,570 --> 01:34:01,970
I am the teacher of this place
Just as the stay quarters.

1069
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I have the key. Income I give you.

1070
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,920
Come on ... come on ...

1071
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:09,440
Looks like a ghost bungalow dude.

1072
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,670
This bungalow, for these two ghosts
It's a perfect fit.

1073
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:14,390
All right, let's go inside.
Come on guys ...

1074
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:17,920
Lights? Oh ok
No matter ....

1075
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:21,840
the place is not bad.

1076
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,360
It will not be so easy to convince him.

1077
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:26,390
Until then, you better stay here.

1078
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:28,510
Otherwise, I said I would read Azaira experience.

1079
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:33,540
What happened, Varun?

1080
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:36,160
Is everything alright?

1081
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:37,780
All right. What is his condition?

1082
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:41,310
she is fine. Just all the time
Sitting in front of the computer.

1083
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:48,030
Well, her e-mail ID
nithya88@hotmail.com, isn't it?

1084
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:49,060
Yes, that's right.

1085
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:57,780
- Another 5 minutes ...
- Okay.

1086
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
All these mails I wrote 3 years ago, Nithya.

1087
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:03,630
But today I have the courage to send you.

1088
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:05,550
Read these.

1089
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:08,280
"I love you"

1090
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,900
I sent these articles earlier
there seemed to be no gain.

1091
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,120
Because, I knew you wouldn't read that.

1092
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:27,450
That's why I didn't send you these emails.

1093
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:29,470
But I sent it today, because ...
One day or another you will surely read it.

1094
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,700
(Barun Message Ditch)
- I'll be with you that day.

1095
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:34,820
A nice little room ...

1096
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:36,340
A window next to it.

1097
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,170
the mind wants through the window
I drag you ....
(Speaking of hostel life)

1098
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:40,470
Forbids you to come
I acted like a fool, Nithya.

1099
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:43,290
I'm an ass!
An insanity!

1100
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:45,720
Tomorrow is our first day of college.

1101
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,040
I'm not feeling well.

1102
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:49,360
It would be nice to have you here.

1103
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:50,790
It would have been great.

1104
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:52,410
Honestly ...

1105
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:55,540
You are supposed to be here.
I'm not supposed to stay.

1106
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:00,860
You are angry with me now. That's why
What, I did not reply to any of my mails.

1107
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:05,380
I understand,
You forgot me, didn't you?

1108
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:08,010
It seems that I no longer exist in life.

1109
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:09,630
Just respond once, Nithya.

1110
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:12,460
I'll be leaving ...
Why don't you stay away ...

1111
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,380
You love me so much
You did a lot for me ...

1112
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,900
Embrace me with love and absolute affection
It is impossible to measure the value of time.

1113
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:24,930
here I am everyone's "profit guru".
I named my kitcshen "Lover".

1114
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:26,450
All my friends know about you.

1115
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,480
Are you smiling? Smile ...

1116
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:33,600
I might be without you
I can survive, Nithya.
But there will be a lot of trouble ....

1117
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:36,020
Can i tell you something
Let's just say ...

1118
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:38,250
You are more beautiful than I can imagine.

1119
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:44,770
Punish me, still
Excuse me.

1120
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,200
- Good morning ...
- Good morning ...

1121
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:00,220
hey ... don't go ... come on ...
Why are you standing here?

1122
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:06,140
Have you read my emails?

1123
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:12,570
I read 483 emails. I couldn't sleep at night.

1124
01:37:13,090 --> 01:37:14,590
I couldn't even sleep in the morning.

1125
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,920
Sorry ... for disturbing your sleep.

1126
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:20,940
And, thanks. To read e-mails.

1127
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:29,960
then ...

1128
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:32,590
Nothing ...

1129
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:34,410
I mean ...

1130
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:36,640
After reading the e-mails ...

1131
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:39,560
What should I say?

1132
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:41,380
"I understand you"
Want to hear that?

1133
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:45,410
I know you very well, Varun.
there is nothing to say here.

1134
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:49,730
If you send me these (e-mails) then ...

1135
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:52,460
I would assume, these are straightforward
It came from your mind.

1136
01:37:54,180 --> 01:37:56,080
I said these things from the heart, Nithya.

1137
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,100
I just thought,
I am reading a beautiful book.

1138
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,120
the day I left you ...

1139
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:10,240
Every second from that day till today
You were in my mind, Nithya.

1140
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:12,170
Only you ...

1141
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:21,390
Do you think I read your emails?
Shall I come to you and apologize?

1142
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,620
I know ...

1143
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,940
You're not the kind of person to leave so soon ...

1144
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,560
But it would have been better to leave.

1145
01:38:32,290 --> 01:38:33,690
I will wait for the revelation here ...

1146
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:37,110
hey, why should I wait?
That Jenny ... don't come, mama ... don't come.

1147
01:38:54,540 --> 01:38:58,440
<i> ♪ No matter how far you want to go ... ♪ </i>

1148
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,560
<i> ♪ I will be so close to you. ♪ </i>

1149
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,380
hey, what are you singing?

1150
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:06,310
she tells you to go away and die.
(Get Lost)

1151
01:39:06,430 --> 01:39:07,430
In this case ...

1152
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:10,960
That's why you are so unknown, that's why I made you sad,
How come you are so unfamiliar, how I have changed so much,

1153
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:12,480
Sing this kind of song ...

1154
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,300
Oi ... this is the tune of Sir Mahfuzur Rahman.

1155
01:39:14,530 --> 01:39:16,530
You know how many people listen to his songs
Crazy wandering the streets ...

1156
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:18,750
On Eid, she sang 'Smritir Alpana Anki'

1157
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:21,180
the melody is good, the throat of the song is also good!

1158
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:26,400
<i> ♪ No matter how far you want to go ... ♪ </i>

1159
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,520
<i> ♪ I will be so close to you. ♪ </i>

1160
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:42,100
What do you want, Varun?

1161
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,020
You ...

1162
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:52,840
the girl you're here for,
I'm not that girl ...

1163
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:57,560
Fida sits in the auditorium and listens to your songs
the girl who is going to be lost.

1164
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:05,780
I just came for you, Nithya.
I have said sorry a million times .....

1165
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:09,110
That mail ...

1166
01:44:10,030 --> 01:44:11,830
Every word in the mail came to my mind.

1167
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,960
How many more years will you not talk to me?

1168
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:19,980
Every day spent there, every watch,
You were the only one in every feeling.

1169
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
- What else can I do?
- I don't know.

1170
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:25,830
Is my guilt so big?

1171
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:33,350
For my family, for study, one
Took a little time for the job. Is that it?

1172
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:34,780
Is it wrong?

1173
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:36,900
Everything is over, isn't it?

1174
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:42,620
Oh ... so, when you open the wish box
This time my name has come. Isn't it?

1175
01:44:46,350 --> 01:44:49,450
You come here and call me,
And will I be ready?

1176
01:44:49,470 --> 01:44:52,470
If you want to finish this job
It would have taken you another three years ...

1177
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:54,900
then you'll come back in three years, won't you?

1178
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,820
Why now?

1179
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:00,540
Understand for me? Or your plan
According to the age of marriage.

1180
01:45:04,570 --> 01:45:05,770
I understand your anger.

1181
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:08,190
I feel like ... no ...

1182
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,820
It's up to you and me, Nithya.
***** OUR ****

1183
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:13,540
Varun and Nithya ...

1184
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:17,960
That was four years ago.
Now there is nothing ... no love.

1185
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:33,590
Because you ...
You ...

1186
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:35,410
Tell me again ...

1187
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:37,240
You were the first to mention break-up.

1188
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,560
I agree ...

1189
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:44,180
I did the break-up.
But you forced me.

1190
01:45:45,310 --> 01:45:46,510
Don't you remember that?

1191
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:49,030
Don't talk about the past anymore, Nithya.

1192
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:50,160
Talk to you soon ...

1193
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:52,380
I'm arguing with you here
I didn't come to do it, Nithya.

1194
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,000
You know why I came here.

1195
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:56,530
For you

1196
01:45:58,450 --> 01:45:59,550
Let's go to Hyderabad and talk.

1197
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:01,580
I will not go to Hyderabad.

1198
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:03,400
I have a lot of work to do here.

1199
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,620
You're suddenly here, I'm everything
I can't leave you anymore.

1200
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:08,550
Don't go for me ...

1201
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:10,370
This is my life now.
That's all I have, Varun.

1202
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,700
I think you understand.

1203
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:19,320
Even if you stay here for another 6 months
there will be no work, right?

1204
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,440
Honestly, you're not too busy.

1205
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:24,170
You want revenge, don't you?

1206
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:27,090
You thought you ate me
No more work, right?

1207
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:31,220
Actually, your words are mine
Not once did I remember.

1208
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:33,040
Honestly, you were not in my thoughts.

1209
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:36,060
Look at these kids,
they are my everything now.

1210
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:37,590
Many years ago ...

1211
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:39,510
I thought you were my world.

1212
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:40,640
Don't worry now ...

1213
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:43,460
If you admit,
One day I was your world

1214
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,380
But today these kids are all yours.

1215
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:47,210
So, you are doing something in life.

1216
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:52,130
This is what I said that day. But
You made me a much bigger villain.

1217
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,160
Well, you studied psychology, didn't you?

1218
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,380
Think logically ...

1219
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,500
I didn't bring you to Kerala,
That's why you broke up.

1220
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:00,330
Because of your stubbornness
If i were you

1221
01:47:00,550 --> 01:47:02,550
Would this world of yours have developed then?
Nothing would have happened .....

1222
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:09,180
Like Akaimma, back to my home
To wait all the time.

1223
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,000
I used to sit like Akaimma?

1224
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:17,420
That's right.

1225
01:47:17,650 --> 01:47:19,450
Is all this possible because of you?

1226
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:21,570
You changed my life?

1227
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,400
I name our school building
I'll put it in your name, Varun.

1228
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:25,920
Thanks ...

1229
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,040
Nithya ...

1230
01:47:27,470 --> 01:47:29,970
Didn't write in the e-mail ...
"We're here to stay together" - isn't it?

1231
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:31,420
This is our true nature.

1232
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:34,540
You don't want to talk about the past, do you?
But I can't forget the past.

1233
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,560
"We didn't come to be together."
This is what is written on our foreheads.

1234
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:38,180
What are you talking about Baal?

1235
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:41,200
You don't want to be alone, we live together.

1236
01:47:41,550 --> 01:47:44,050
I say it again, every time
We are separated because of you.

1237
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,780
We broke up because of you.

1238
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,700
If there is any problem, you run away.

1239
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:50,220
Even this time you say,
We cannot be one.

1240
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:54,550
We cannot be one.

1241
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:58,470
Without shouting, without quarreling, without arguing ...

1242
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:01,200
We can't say a word, can we?

1243
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:02,520
That's why I said ...

1244
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:06,540
All your ajaira words
It is not possible for me to be the master.

1245
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:12,070
You have to settle everything
You've come this far, haven't you?

1246
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:14,590
And now you say, all my fault?

1247
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,320
If you put all the blame on my neck?

1248
01:48:17,540 --> 01:48:18,840
Just 15 minutes ...

1249
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,260
If you can't keep your head down and talk.

1250
01:48:21,290 --> 01:48:22,290
How do i trust you

1251
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:24,310
- How can I believe?
- No need to come ...

1252
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:26,440
Is there no brain in the head?

1253
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:28,460
I don't even need to believe.
And there is no need to come.

1254
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:55,500
One minute!

1255
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:58,520
- hello
- Hi ... It's me Nithya ...

1256
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,640
I have come to Hyderabad.

1257
01:52:08,670 --> 01:52:10,370
Want to talk to you

1258
01:52:12,190 --> 01:52:13,490
It's ok, tell me

1259
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,520
Can we meet somewhere?

1260
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:38,240
hello ...

1261
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:42,660
I came to see a friend,
I'll call you later ... bye ...

1262
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:54,490
Before leaving Manapada,
Didn't you tell me once? ...

1263
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:03,140
Anyway, I didn't come here to talk about that.

1264
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:07,860
Vidya is getting married.

1265
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:10,480
- I'm here to invite you.
- when?

1266
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:12,910
the wedding is tomorrow.

1267
01:53:13,930 --> 01:53:14,930
I came yesterday.

1268
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:18,160
Sorry for the last minute invitation.

1269
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:21,680
I wanted to meet you and invite you.

1270
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:24,100
Will you come?

1271
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:28,230
Good thing you called.

1272
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:30,850
In fact, I had something to say to you.

1273
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:36,480
My marriage is fixed Nithya.

1274
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,500
My sister-in-law's younger sister.

1275
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:44,120
they have been saying this for a long time.

1276
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:47,770
the marriage was fixed this month.

1277
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:49,170
I also agreed.

1278
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:52,600
the wedding will take place next month.

1279
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:57,920
Now ... I will do a small ceremony.

1280
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:02,040
I have a job. In London ...
It is a brokerage firm.

1281
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:04,070
Company name Seymour Pierce.

1282
01:54:06,490 --> 01:54:07,790
her name is Radhika.

1283
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:15,720
Congratulations, Varun.

1284
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:18,540
That's good news.

1285
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:26,560
Will you come tomorrow

1286
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:28,490
Early morning marriage.

1287
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:30,710
You come to the reception.

1288
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,540
He's going too far from me ...

1289
01:55:45,860 --> 01:55:47,060
He has found someone

1290
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:51,580
He is leaving without me.

1291
01:55:51,810 --> 01:55:55,610
He has agreed to marry someone else,
therefore, I no longer exist in his life.

1292
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:58,030
I am no longer in his life.

1293
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:04,760
I made a mistake, sister.
I made a big mistake. I know ...

1294
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:09,480
I never thought he would do that.

1295
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,900
I never thought this would happen.

1296
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:13,630
Nithya ...

1297
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:15,550
Please, don't cry ...

1298
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:20,480
I did not speak to him that day.

1299
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:23,500
he came to my classroom.

1300
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:26,420
And he was standing there looking at me.

1301
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:29,650
As soon as I look at the children, he is no
he left without speaking.

1302
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:30,670
he's gone!

1303
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:43,200
If he hugged me and said,
"I will never leave you."

1304
01:57:08,215 --> 01:57:14,059
I wouldn't let him go then.

1305
01:57:44,603 --> 01:57:46,993
One second

1306
01:57:51,577 --> 01:57:54,632
Are you ok?
why did you come here Nithya?

1307
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:59,338
Varun's friends are here  that's why, come.

1308
01:58:15,781 --> 01:58:21,472
Is this our path?

1309
01:58:25,101 --> 01:58:31,049
Is this the way which we fulfill our desires?

1310
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:44,541
Is this our path?

1311
01:58:47,204 --> 01:58:53,571
Is this the way which we fulfill our desires?

1312
01:58:55,572 --> 01:59:00,438
Do I really need to believe this is happening?

1313
01:59:00,438 --> 01:59:08,343
Do I really need to hide my love?

1314
01:59:08,343 --> 01:59:12,952
How many wonders do I have to watch from afar?

1315
02:00:15,590 --> 02:00:16,890
Nithya, I'm Varun.

1316
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:21,120
Varun ......

1317
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:27,940
I want to talk to you.
I thought I would call.

1318
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:30,560
But I don't understand,
Is it okay to call now?

1319
02:00:35,890 --> 02:00:38,790
I thought I would call but
You called.

1320
02:00:41,510 --> 02:00:42,810
Really?

1321
02:00:45,430 --> 02:00:47,130
What do you think, Nithya?

1322
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:50,750
Why are you today

1323
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:55,080
What do you want

1324
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:54,300
Sorry, I don't know what I'm doing.

1325
02:01:54,430 --> 02:01:56,630
when it's time to leave, leave.

1326
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:01,350
No problem.

1327
02:02:01,570 --> 02:02:04,070
I have to get out of the house at 5 o'clock.
Mom will wake up at 4:30.

1328
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:06,200
Will get married in the temple.

1329
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:08,020
That's why I have to go early in the morning.

1330
02:02:09,570 --> 02:02:11,270
Why are you here, Nithya?

1331
02:02:15,090 --> 02:02:16,690
I came to wish you.
(Wish: Greetings)

1332
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:21,420
And I'm sorry to hear that.

1333
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:26,040
I don't want you to hate me

1334
02:02:26,570 --> 02:02:28,070
This is more important to me.

1335
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:30,090
It's not possible, Nithya.

1336
02:02:33,410 --> 02:02:34,810
I hate you, Nithya.

1337
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:39,540
Me ... my love ...

1338
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:41,760
You never understand

1339
02:02:42,790 --> 02:02:44,190
You are not worthy of my love.

1340
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:46,310
In this part of the roof ...

1341
02:02:47,530 --> 02:02:50,330
To take me with you
I fell at your feet.

1342
02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:52,660
I felt the same way that day.

1343
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:57,480
You don't understand me ...
You don't understand my love.

1344
02:02:57,510 --> 02:02:59,110
You are not worthy of my love.

1345
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:01,030
I also went to Manapad, Nithya.

1346
02:03:01,050 --> 02:03:02,050
Varun .........

1347
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:03,680
And there is no need to do that.

1348
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:06,000
We have already done a lot.

1349
02:03:07,230 --> 02:03:08,430
And no, please.

1350
02:03:08,550 --> 02:03:10,250
We're both fine now.

1351
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:13,270
We should be like friends.

1352
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:16,000
Don't hate ... okay?

1353
02:03:16,620 --> 02:03:17,620
All right.

1354
02:03:25,550 --> 02:03:27,250
I'm going ...

1355
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:30,270
Do you understand that you are going to Manapada tomorrow?

1356
02:03:30,590 --> 02:03:32,090
How do you know

1357
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:36,520
We have two postmen.
Our common friends. (Jenny and Prakash)

1358
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:40,540
they don't tell me anything about you.

1359
02:03:40,570 --> 02:03:42,570
I know that ...

1360
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:45,490
Is it a new car?

1361
02:03:47,410 --> 02:03:49,410
Not mine ... it's my father's ...

1362
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:00,840
Wow, Varun ....

1363
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:02,860
Really very beautiful ....

1364
02:04:03,590 --> 02:04:05,090
I'm happy for you.

1365
02:04:06,664 --> 02:04:08,928
Drive now.

1366
02:04:13,530 --> 02:04:15,030
You don't take things the wrong way.

1367
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:17,060
I'm not saying to insult you.

1368
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:21,080
I mean, when you bring a car,
then I would drive.

1369
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:22,900
So ...

1370
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:25,220
Now it's your turn ...

1371
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:16,550
What happened?

1372
02:05:17,570 --> 02:05:19,070
Nothing.

1373
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:27,600
Does Radhika know about me ?!

1374
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:29,820
Yes she knows.

1375
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,740
Not letting her know,
is impossible for me to explain myself.

1376
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:36,170
I was the first to take the class because of you.

1377
02:05:36,690 --> 02:05:39,590
Getting last grade in HSC
You passed, because of me.

1378
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:45,520
You eat shrimp
the habit happened because of me

1379
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:49,240
Again because of me
You stopped eating. Does she know it?

1380
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:54,460
You eat 40 shrimps, hold your stomach,
when you were crying like a baby ...

1381
02:05:54,490 --> 02:05:58,590
I didn't feel bad then.
Got a lot of fun!

1382
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:01,510
Were you scared to see 40 shrimps?

1383
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:06,840
I learned a lot more from you.

1384
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:11,760
Never a girl on the day of closure
It is not right to go to the restaurant to eat.

1385
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:15,280
when you go to the movies,
Must be present at the right time.

1386
02:06:15,310 --> 02:06:18,410
On birthdays, from morning to evening,
Girlfriend has to give time.

1387
02:06:18,430 --> 02:06:19,430
That ...

1388
02:06:19,460 --> 02:06:22,260
I have learned all this from you.
You have to be thankful for that.

1389
02:06:24,180 --> 02:06:27,080
You must have learned a lot!

1390
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:33,100
I learned two things.

1391
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:35,430
One is definitely "cricket".

1392
02:06:36,350 --> 02:06:40,550
What is leg spin? What is off-spin?
Out swing ... in-swing ...

1393
02:06:41,480 --> 02:06:43,180
Who is "Adam Gilchrist"?

1394
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:46,300
And that Australian wicket-keeper,
I know that ...

1395
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:49,420
I know you girls, this foreigner
Get to know the players very well.

1396
02:06:49,650 --> 02:06:52,150
All right, who said "Ramesh Power"?

1397
02:06:53,870 --> 02:06:55,870
You see ... you got caught!

1398
02:07:03,500 --> 02:07:04,500
then ...

1399
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:09,120
You will arrange marry,
I never really thought of that.

1400
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:14,340
I have known her for a long time, Nithya.

1401
02:07:15,070 --> 02:07:16,370
As brother-in-law.

1402
02:07:17,390 --> 02:07:19,390
she used to come to our house from time to time.

1403
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:22,720
And she is a very good girl.

1404
02:07:25,540 --> 02:07:27,340
I actually came to this event to see her.

1405
02:07:29,060 --> 02:07:31,260
I came to see, who are you marrying?

1406
02:07:34,190 --> 02:07:36,290
What is your plan? when are you getting married

1407
02:07:37,610 --> 02:07:38,810
Didn't think about marriage.

1408
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:45,740
What are you talking about, Nithya.

1409
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:48,460
You always talk about marriage.

1410
02:07:50,980 --> 02:07:52,480
I didn't talk about my marriage, Varun.

1411
02:07:53,510 --> 02:07:55,410
I used to talk about marrying you.

1412
02:08:03,530 --> 02:08:05,530
"I'm sorry", Nithya.

1413
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:49,460
What situation are you going through,
Why didn't you tell me once, Varun?

1414
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:56,080
Your home, father, mother, younger brother ...
Why didn't you tell me about this?

1415
02:08:58,300 --> 02:09:00,500
You know, boys
Most of the time they are stupid.

1416
02:09:02,330 --> 02:09:03,730
Ego stays high!

1417
02:09:07,550 --> 02:09:09,050
That's right ...

1418
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:56,680
This place hasn't changed a bit.

1419
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:00,300
the swing is in the same place as before.

1420
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:03,920
It is a middle class colony, Nithya.

1421
02:10:05,450 --> 02:10:06,850
Nothing will change.

1422
02:10:07,470 --> 02:10:10,570
It was also my colony. Forgot?

1423
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:14,500
Once upon a time ...

1424
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:17,720
You're right, Nithya.

1425
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:22,440
In case of any problem, immediately
"I don't want that," she said.

1426
02:10:22,970 --> 02:10:25,370
"Leave me alone"
You didn't say that right that day

1427
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:29,590
But, you treat me like this
You didn't make the issue right.

1428
02:10:30,110 --> 02:10:34,010
Even, I told you to leave, so
What do you mean, you're leaving me?

1429
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:40,040
Just three hours before your wedding
I told you this, remember.

1430
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:48,560
You're my best friend, Varun.

1431
02:10:50,490 --> 02:10:53,990
You know me better than I do.
Likewise, I know you well.

1432
02:10:55,510 --> 02:10:57,510
I wanted to tell you that too.

1433
02:10:58,530 --> 02:11:00,130
Did you come here to say that?

1434
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,360
To say all this?

1435
02:11:04,580 --> 02:11:06,580
Don't say anything else?

1436
02:12:40,710 --> 02:12:42,710
Dad ...

1437
02:12:44,830 --> 02:12:46,730
You didn't sleep?

1438
02:12:47,950 --> 02:12:49,050
Varun ...

1439
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:52,680
You're so late, with that girl
Went to meet, right?

1440
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:57,900
How were you when you did MBA at IIM ...

1441
02:12:58,930 --> 02:13:03,830
How was it when I was studying engineering ...
I have seen both.

1442
02:13:04,850 --> 02:13:06,850
Something happened to you, I know.

1443
02:13:07,870 --> 02:13:13,370
Either way, despite the fear of losing your job,
You do not have the permission required to post.

1444
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:20,300
I found out by talking to Prakash ..
Or she is running a school in Manapada.

1445
02:13:21,433 --> 02:13:25,953
I have heard about Nithya from Appu once or twice.

1446
02:13:26,650 --> 02:13:31,250
Once instead of calling your mother "amma", you called her Nithya.

1447
02:13:31,970 --> 02:13:33,070
Yes, Dad.

1448
02:13:34,490 --> 02:13:35,890
I went in search of her.

1449
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:39,120
I want to meet her
Went and showed.

1450
02:13:40,940 --> 02:13:42,040
I said good bye.

1451
02:13:42,370 --> 02:13:43,570
Can I say good bye?

1452
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:49,190
What are you going to do now?
You don't understand, do you?

1453
02:13:51,910 --> 02:13:53,910
What will happen to Radhika ...

1454
02:13:55,940 --> 02:13:57,940
the matter is really a matter of tension.

1455
02:13:58,460 --> 02:14:00,560
Radhika is like our daughter.

1456
02:14:00,990 --> 02:14:03,790
It would not be right to hurt her.

1457
02:14:05,810 --> 02:14:09,710
You love someone
I will suffer for her ...

1458
02:14:09,730 --> 02:14:11,730
And I will marry Radhika.
That's not right either.

1459
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:17,860
You can't keep her happy either.

1460
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:20,580
This is very unjust.

1461
02:14:22,510 --> 02:14:24,510
I don't think she forgot you either.

1462
02:14:28,830 --> 02:14:30,830
If that's the problem ...

1463
02:14:31,750 --> 02:14:33,850
You must know what to do then.

1464
02:16:03,980 --> 02:16:05,980
Varun ...

1465
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:09,300
Why are you here

1466
02:16:09,630 --> 02:16:11,930
Ask your sister,
Why am I here ...

1467
02:16:11,950 --> 02:16:13,750
Close the door, Kavia.

1468
02:16:13,870 --> 02:16:15,870
Why I'm here... Tell them ...

1469
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:26,500
I never remembered your words.

1470
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:28,720
hey ... I didn't say that. Your sister says.

1471
02:16:30,450 --> 02:16:32,150
How can i trust you

1472
02:16:34,470 --> 02:16:37,570
Did you find me stupid,
whenever I call?

1473
02:16:39,490 --> 02:16:41,490
We can never be together ...

1474
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:44,220
I didn't say but ...

1475
02:16:45,540 --> 02:16:46,840
Said your sister.

1476
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:50,270
Manapade did not say this?

1477
02:16:50,890 --> 02:16:52,890
That's when I left.

1478
02:16:54,710 --> 02:16:58,010
You don't believe me And
I had no hope.

1479
02:16:59,940 --> 02:17:01,840
I came here and agreed to get married.

1480
02:17:04,560 --> 02:17:05,960
Why are you now, Nithya?

1481
02:17:07,890 --> 02:17:11,490
I mean we never love each other
I can't hate, can I?

1482
02:17:14,910 --> 02:17:18,710
Varun, Dad is at home.
All this stay now. Talk to you later.

1483
02:17:21,830 --> 02:17:23,730
Why should I care about your parents?

1484
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:25,960
she never thought about my parents.

1485
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:30,580
What does it matter to me if she hates me?

1486
02:17:30,810 --> 02:17:32,110
I hate you

1487
02:17:32,830 --> 02:17:33,930
What happened?

1488
02:17:34,950 --> 02:17:36,750
I'm sorry, Varun.

1489
02:17:38,980 --> 02:17:40,380
I should say sorry.

1490
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:41,900
Do you know who should say?

1491
02:17:43,230 --> 02:17:46,830
To Radhika, to her parents, to my fiance,
Who is Harish Bhaiya, my family ....

1492
02:17:46,850 --> 02:17:48,850
the marriage broke up on the day of the wedding ...

1493
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:52,970
To the rest of the world who would want to beat 
me with slippers for canceling at the day of the wedding.

1494
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Sorry ...

1495
02:17:55,420 --> 02:17:57,820
Are you sorry now? I do not believe.

1496
02:17:58,750 --> 02:18:00,250
I do not believe.

1497
02:18:04,970 --> 02:18:06,970
I thought this was your life
I will never see the face again, Nithya.

1498
02:18:08,490 --> 02:18:11,890
But tomorrow is when you actually are
I want to get closer to you.

1499
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:16,120
That's why ... that's why ... I hate you.

1500
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:25,340
Don't cry, Nithya. Don't cry

1501
02:18:26,970 --> 02:18:30,470
It is very easy for girls to cry.
This is not to say that we should cry over everything.

1502
02:18:32,990 --> 02:18:35,890
Vidya Apu, what happened? What am I doing here?

1503
02:18:35,910 --> 02:18:37,910
I'm going ...

1504
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:50,540
Who are you

1505
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:52,960
I came to see your daughter.

1506
02:18:57,390 --> 02:18:59,990
Not number three. Number two. Nithya.

1507
02:19:00,010 --> 02:19:01,410
Nithya! ...

1508
02:19:02,530 --> 02:19:04,330
she knows nothing.
I came.

1509
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:05,660
Nithya! ...

1510
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:09,080
I just came here.

1511
02:19:10,910 --> 02:19:12,910
Varun ... Varun Krishna.

1512
02:19:18,430 --> 02:19:19,930
- Vidya, what's going on here?
- Dad, nothing happened. I'll tell you later.

1513
02:19:19,950 --> 02:19:22,350
-Listen ...
- I've been here many more times.

1514
02:19:25,380 --> 02:19:26,580
I know him very well.

1515
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:31,900
From school life ... when we were eight.

1516
02:19:32,920 --> 02:19:34,220
Alaknanda Apartments ...

1517
02:19:41,450 --> 02:19:45,050
After getting up at Inter, 20 minutes before college
A separate car could be reacshed to reach.

1518
02:19:46,970 --> 02:19:48,470
she would go for me.

1519
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:53,900
Aunty, you used to send that extra lunch box,
That was for me too.

1520
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:01,920
she has a mobile in college
Was lost. Remember?

1521
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:06,440
That mobile is still with me.

1522
02:20:10,470 --> 02:20:11,970
the first of my life ...

1523
02:20:12,790 --> 02:20:16,590
Five Star Lange .........
Thanks to your credit card, Uncle.

1524
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:18,620
At school ...

1525
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:22,740
I lost all my friends till class ten,
Going to join your daughter's school.

1526
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:31,060
when I missed the bonus of one and a half lakh rupees
I went to meet Manapad with your daughter.

1527
02:20:34,990 --> 02:20:36,490
the job was almost gone.

1528
02:20:38,610 --> 02:20:41,810
And to get the serial talking to him,
Had to wait 10 days.

1529
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:45,240
Today is my wedding.

1530
02:20:45,960 --> 02:20:49,360
Shortly after the wedding moment. Married at 5:30.
And I'm standing here.

1531
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:52,380
the girl's name is Radhika ...
My close relatives.

1532
02:20:53,910 --> 02:20:56,910
I loved your daughter.

1533
02:20:57,930 --> 02:21:05,930
After loving your daughter,
It is never possible to love another girl.

1534
02:21:06,860 --> 02:21:08,760
I'm telling you why all this?

1535
02:21:10,480 --> 02:21:13,780
- Nithya, what's going on?
- Dad, please ... Dad ...

1536
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:17,500
- Varun.
- I'm leaving, Nithya.

1537
02:21:17,530 --> 02:21:19,330
Don't go ... Varun, please ...

1538
02:21:19,350 --> 02:21:21,350
I don't want to stand here for another moment.

1539
02:21:21,380 --> 02:21:22,480
Why are you telling me to stand up?

1540
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:26,000
You know, Varun.
You don't know

1541
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:27,120
I do not know

1542
02:21:27,350 --> 02:21:29,350
I do not know

1543
02:21:30,970 --> 02:21:33,570
Why did you come yesterday, Nithya? Tell me ...

1544
02:21:33,900 --> 02:21:35,100
Went to see Radhika, understand?

1545
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:38,220
- You went to make us lifelong friends?
- I Love You, Varun.

1546
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:43,340
Now why are you saying, Nithya?

1547
02:21:43,670 --> 02:21:44,870
Not just now ...

1548
02:21:44,990 --> 02:21:47,590
I have always loved you
I will love more; You know that

1549
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:48,920
Do you know what that means?

1550
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:52,940
Good times, bad times, forget the ego,
Without a doubt, in the midst of hundreds of fights and tears ...

1551
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:53,960
Until the last breath ...

1552
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:55,990
For the rest of my life ...
I know ...

1553
02:21:57,810 --> 02:21:59,810
I will always love you
..

1554
02:22:12,330 --> 02:22:15,930
It was my fault.

1555
02:22:18,460 --> 02:22:20,260
Not just last night ...

1556
02:22:20,380 --> 02:22:23,580
6 months ago ... at school ... at college ... always ...

1557
02:22:24,410 --> 02:22:26,410
I could not let the matter get so big.

1558
02:22:27,830 --> 02:22:30,830
then we have so long
I shouldn't have stopped talking.

1559
02:22:30,850 --> 02:22:32,850
I didn't have to stay that far.

1560
02:22:32,980 --> 02:22:34,980
We wouldn't be apart for a minute.

1561
02:22:35,900 --> 02:22:37,900
I can't anymore.

1562
02:22:37,930 --> 02:22:39,930
And how many of us will wrap ourselves?

1563
02:22:41,950 --> 02:22:46,650
the rest of my life is in your shadow,
I want to fill it with love.

1564
02:22:47,970 --> 02:22:52,270
Talk to you soon and keep up the good content
I should have said that.

1565
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:10,000
You won't say anything?

1566
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:13,920
I told you!

1567
02:23:26,950 --> 02:23:29,450
What are you saying Would it have been better to do so 6 years ago?

1568
02:23:29,470 --> 02:23:30,970
she would kick me out.

1569
02:23:33,490 --> 02:23:36,890
Your father saw all this
Will have three heart strokes.

1570
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:46,220
I learned another thing from you ...
I didn't tell you that ...

1571
02:23:47,740 --> 02:23:48,840
What is that?

1572
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:50,570
1 o'clock is cricket.

1573
02:23:50,990 --> 02:23:52,190
And what is number 2?

1574
02:23:52,910 --> 02:23:54,910
It's ...

1575
02:24:12,940 --> 02:24:14,940
Dad ...

1576
02:24:19,960 --> 02:24:21,860
Thinking the game is over?

1577
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:25,124
We had four huge fights after our wedding

1578
02:24:25,124 --> 02:24:27,957
we have four children

1579
02:24:27,957 --> 02:24:33,413
That's the matter, some fights are good.
