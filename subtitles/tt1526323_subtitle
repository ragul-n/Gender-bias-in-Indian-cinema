l want everyone to say

104
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:48,544
Hero is on move...

105
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,703
Nobody can catch him...

106
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,847
Very smart...

107
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:52,913
Very clever...

108
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:55,217
He wears a mask...

109
00:15:55,385 --> 00:15:57,512
Salt and camphor do look alike...

110
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:59,712
But don't cheated by
his innocent face...

111
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:00,753
He's a cheat...

112
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:01,856
He's a fraud...

113
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:04,550
Don't fall into his trap...

114
00:16:05,028 --> 00:16:06,893
He's most cunning...

115
00:16:07,364 --> 00:16:09,229
His timing is perfect...

116
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:11,500
He's wrong in right...

117
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,737
He's king in palaces...

118
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:18,034
Changes colour faster
than chameleon...

119
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:20,406
Master in planning...

120
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:30,911
Don't try to find a defect in him,
you can never find it...

121
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:42,356
Oh he's a big cheat...

122
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:44,295
I know very well about him...

123
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,265
My tongue has gone dry
saying about him...

124
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:48,734
But nobody believes it...

125
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:53,274
Moreover there's great
demand for such guys...

126
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:55,673
But anyway I'll try once again...

127
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:58,075
I'll surely rip out his skin...

128
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:02,449
Sorry, I want to be a good boy.

129
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:05,087
That's why I don't smoke
when people are around...

130
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:11,417
Cat walking beauties...

131
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:13,653
Don't fall for him...

132
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,798
Don't get swept...
don't fall flat...

133
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,830
Life is watching...

134
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:20,435
He's fox under the garb of sheep...

135
00:17:20,603 --> 00:17:22,628
His mind is like manhole...

136
00:17:22,806 --> 00:17:24,797
He's a cheat...and very cheap guy...

137
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:27,465
He's confusing puzzle...

138
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:35,646
Don't trust the heart hijacker...

139
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:38,818
He's a magician...

140
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:45,326
Don't touch him...

141
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:34,432
Oh My god! He's a black sheep...

142
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:38,572
If you give him a chance,
he'll steal everything...

143
00:18:39,949 --> 00:18:43,385
Oh God! He raises dust...

144
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:47,547
Some nymph from heaven
must stop him...

145
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:22,080
You got best employee award.

146
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:32,661
Sir. feed a sweet to your friend.

147
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:35,734
He's not my friend!

148
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:38,841
l feel like shouting loudly!
But can't do it.

149
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:40,877
Sir. feed a sweet to your friend.

150
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:48,680
He appears always as an enemy.
l want him out but he's pitching in.

151
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,321
He's everything. Ajay is nothing.

152
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,650
But Ajay boasts as if it's all his.

153
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:58,727
Without Arya. he's nothing.
he got lucky.

154
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:01,194
l felt like everyone was
discussing about me only.

155
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:04,357
Though this office is mine.
but l feel it's not.

156
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:07,003
My office. the suit l'm wearing.

157
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:09,966
my home. my cars.

158
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:13,470
my status.
l feel it's all alms given by him.

159
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,471
Even the cigarette
l'm smoking now.

160
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:18,538
l feel that too is not mine.

161
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:23,880
But for the first time in life l felt
something is mine at first sight.

162
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:25,017
Geetha.

163
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,559
Geetha sister. come.

164
00:20:56,554 --> 00:21:01,423
Bye sister!

165
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:07,420
You're going to hi-tech city.
aren't you?

166
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:10,058
Look. how l got it right!

167
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:12,832
Don't consider me cheap
for taking lift.

168
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:16,598
Today is my first day in office.
l don't want to be late.

169
00:21:18,008 --> 00:21:19,441
Can l switch on the radio?

170
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:28,579
We too have many cars.
l can also use a car.

171
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:32,478
But my father insists me to marry
if l want to use a car.

172
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:36,353
Can't marry to use a car. right?

173
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:46,793
This is not your car. right?

174
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,496
Though it is yours.
you feel it is not. right?

175
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:51,800
Did you see how l found it?

176
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:58,576
lf it was your car. would you
pose for photo while driving?

177
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:06,819
Little further.

178
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:10,486
Little further.

179
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:16,661
Just a show off to get down
at the entrance.

180
00:22:46,997 --> 00:22:48,362
We are best friends. right?

181
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:58,534
What?
- l'll spin the coin.

182
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,534
Heads or tails?

183
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:12,119
Heads. Geetha is mine.
- No. she's mine.

184
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:15,617
We are friends.
whatever you win is mine.

185
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:19,889
Whatever l win is yours.
So. Geetha is mine.

186
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:31,568
You're hurt because Arya
doesn't love you.

187
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:36,007
What do you feel when you're happy?
- l feel like hugging Arya.

188
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,738
What do you feel when you're angry?

189
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:41,874
l feel like hugging Arya tightly.

190
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:43,644
You're totally mad.

191
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:48,588
No use. put a line between
you and Arya.

192
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:52,192
Who is HR here?
- No informality. please be formal.

193
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:56,226
That means it's you!
Did you see how found it?

194
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,942
l treat software professionals affected
with psychological problems.

195
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:09,636
Come. l'll introduce your team.

196
00:24:09,813 --> 00:24:12,475
Money and health problems are
abundant in software field.

197
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:15,174
So. l remember health problems
more than their names.

198
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,787
He does everything three times.
Except birth.

199
00:24:27,931 --> 00:24:31,196
Neither he knows nor l know
when he'll sleep and when he'll wake up.

200
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:33,594
He got up. take his photo.
he may sleep again.

201
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:34,795
He slept!

202
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:38,233
He is...

203
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:39,166
You are...?

204
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,205
He's Ghajini. short term memory.

205
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:42,637
He sees me everyday
but doesn't remember me.

206
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:45,907
how can he remember you?
lt's useless to introduce him.

207
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:53,583
What man?
- To my office sir.

208
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:56,658
Your office is in ninth floor.
this is sixth floor.

209
00:24:57,594 --> 00:25:00,119
He's a Vat 69 guy.
Can't differentiate between 6 and 9.

210
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:03,232
his office is in ninth floor
but works in sixth floor.

211
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:06,661
yours is ninth floor. get going!

212
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,861
To tell about me...
- Wait. l'll tell you.

213
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,098
You are kleptomaniac.
you've two weaknesses.

214
00:25:11,275 --> 00:25:12,970
one is lpod.
- Gift from brother-in-law.

215
00:25:13,143 --> 00:25:15,168
Second is laptop.
- Gift from Bill gates.

216
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:17,308
You love those gifts.

217
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:19,943
Did you see how l found it?

218
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:23,018
l'm like that. l can read faces
and tell the character.

219
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:26,856
You forgot to take my photo.

220
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:37,023
So. nobody here is perfect.
All are defective.

221
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:40,298
There's a person without
any defect.

222
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:51,147
He'll not even look at girls.

223
00:25:57,654 --> 00:25:59,622
You're not supposed to say it.
l must say it.

224
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,883
Where is your Mr. Perfect?

225
00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:49,267
Your team. new recruit.

226
00:26:49,606 --> 00:26:55,272
l know it's common in software
for team leaders to harass girls.

227
00:26:55,612 --> 00:26:58,809
But everyone here say that
you're decent and sincere.

228
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:02,418
and that you don't even
look at girls.

229
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:06,888
l didn't believe them but
felt that on seeing you.

230
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:09,056
That you're perfect guy.

231
00:27:10,894 --> 00:27:12,384
You're afraid of lifts. right?

232
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:16,232
Did you see how l found it?

233
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,028
Mr. Perfect. you've a little defect.

234
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:22,366
Getting a team leader like you
is small defect.

235
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:28,372
l praised you.
No reaction for it too.

236
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:51,325
What?
- Arya kissed me.

237
00:27:51,668 --> 00:27:54,262
What else? Did he hug too?
Did he say l love you?

238
00:27:54,438 --> 00:27:55,666
ls it comedy to you?

239
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,935
l too felt the same thing
when l first met Arya.

240
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,275
Like getting kissed.

241
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:04,346
like getting hugged.

242
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:08,947
not only me any girl would
feel the same on seeing Arya.

243
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:12,888
lt seems Geetha too has
fallen flat for Arya.

244
00:28:13,056 --> 00:28:15,854
No Shanthi. Arya really kissed me.

245
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:20,720
He's like that! He disturbs everyone.
But he never falls for anyone.

246
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:24,355
Geetha. you told me but
don't tell this with anyone else.

247
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:26,794
because Arya is perfect. that's it!

248
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,872
Do you say it was my imagination?
- No. hallucination.

249
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,506
First stage of hallucination.

250
00:28:33,844 --> 00:28:37,177
Arya kissed you?
This is a psychological disorder.

251
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:38,371
You feel what had happened
wasn't real.

252
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:39,374
or imagine what didn't happen
had really happened.

253
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:42,708
you mind keeps on going somewhere...
- Where?

254
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,319
Go away.
- Who is he?

255
00:28:44,488 --> 00:28:48,049
Luckily you said Arya kissed you.
so l could diagnose it easily.

256
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:50,056
No sir. Arya really kissed me.

257
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:53,458
Did anyone see Arya kissing you?

258
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:55,731
Geetha too wouldn't have seen it.
- Why?

259
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,730
Generally girls close eyes
at that time. sir.

260
00:28:57,901 --> 00:28:59,061
You keep shut.

261
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,532
Answer me straightly.

262
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,105
What do you feel when you're happy?

263
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,747
Trust me sir. Arya really
kissed me. sir.

264
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:16,215
So. you feel like Arya kissing you.

265
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:19,787
What do you feel when you're angry?
- Sir. l'm getting angry.

266
00:29:19,956 --> 00:29:21,821
What?
- l am angry.

267
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:24,119
What do you feel when you're angry?

268
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:27,286
Do you feel like beating or scratch
or feel like doing something?

269
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:29,193
What do you feel like doing?

270
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:32,795
l think she feels like breaking
the cell phone. sir.

271
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:35,938
Yours is ninth floor?
- Yes sir.- Get going.- No problem sir.

272
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:42,841
You...?

273
00:29:48,302 --> 00:29:50,998
Do you know what is this?

274
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:52,897
Geetha's resignation letter.

275
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:55,440
She resigned the job but
l forced her to reconsider it.

276
00:29:56,043 --> 00:29:58,705
Do you've sense?
Will you kiss at first sight?

277
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,317
l told you already l'll dismiss you
if proven you're bad.

278
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:06,612
ls it proved?

279
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:09,382
Anyone in office believes l did it?

280
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,689
Why did you feel like kissing her?

281
00:30:26,974 --> 00:30:28,805
What was your feeling now?

282
00:30:29,544 --> 00:30:32,479
l felt like l was dying.
- l too felt the same.

283
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:36,640
l felt l would die
if l don't kiss Geetha.

284
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:45,815
How much you love Geetha?

285
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:49,528
How much l like you?
l love Geetha that much.

286
00:30:49,697 --> 00:30:52,791
ls it enough if you love Geetha?
Do you think Geetha too loves you?

287
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,662
l'm sure she'll love me.

288
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,029
Because any girl would
prefer the best.

289
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:58,998
As far l know there only
two best people in this world.

290
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,137
Number one is you and
number two is me.

291
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:04,933
You're number one because
l've accepted you as number one.

292
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,773
Anyway you. number one
dropped out of race.

293
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:08,880
so l'm the only one.

294
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,416
She must love me. Can't avoid.

295
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:15,946
l want to write a love letter to Geetha.

296
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,353
What is this?

297
00:31:18,526 --> 00:31:19,925
Do you want to write
a love letter to Geetha?

298
00:31:20,094 --> 00:31:22,892
lf you do anything stupid like this.
you've to leave me forever.

299
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:25,589
Please don't say like that.
l can't live without you..

300
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:26,892
l don't have anyone
other than you.

301
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:29,093
Please. l'll listen to
whatever you say.

302
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:31,962
Love letters in Email times?

303
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:34,801
My dear Geetha. l must tell
l love you first.

304
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,807
and then write the letter.
and then kiss you.

305
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,139
But l couldn't hold myself
and kissed you first.

306
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,915
Now l'm writing a letter.
l'll say l love you later.

307
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,050
So. last is first and first is last.

308
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:45,545
and feel about the
middle one later.

309
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:50,049
You must know about me.
l smoke cigarette. l drink.

310
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:51,881
lf l get angry. l'll beat anyone.

311
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:54,653
l'll be happy if you still love me
after knowing this.

312
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:56,189
l can't read it any more.

313
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,726
Dasavatharam is very good man.

314
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:07,165
Please don't show this letter to him.

315
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,443
Because he'll not believe it.
l don't believe it.

316
00:32:10,611 --> 00:32:12,875
Why not sir?
- He wrote l'll not believe it.

317
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:14,105
Will you stop believing if he writes it?

318
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:18,214
lf l believe even after he has written.
trust may lose faith in belief.

319
00:32:21,555 --> 00:32:25,218
Look. how much Arya loves me in
this letter which he didn't write.

320
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:31,929
So you don't believe because
Arya wrote you'll not believe. right?

321
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,428
That's all!
- Who wrote you'll not believe it?

322
00:32:34,602 --> 00:32:36,433
Arya!- Where?
- ln the letter.

323
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:38,595
Who wrote the letter?
- Arya.

324
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:42,636
How did l get caught?
- Why are you getting confused. sir?

325
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:43,799
Arya is writing something there.

326
00:32:43,978 --> 00:32:46,845
check his hand writing
with this letter. so simple.

327
00:32:47,014 --> 00:32:49,676
Yours is ninth floor.
- But problem is in sixth floor. sir.

328
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,080
You're making me
test a gentleman.

329
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,965
You check.
- Okay.

330
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:13,465
How could Arya write this letter?
- Check it with his hand writing.

331
00:33:17,244 --> 00:33:19,212
Please write. l love you.

332
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:22,482
What's the spelling sir?

333
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,983
Tell him the spelling.

334
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:48,002
Though Arya didn't write the letter.
she hallucinates he has.

335
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:52,309
Sir. l'm not hallucinating.
- You're angry. aren't you?

336
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:07,950
l expected this and changed
the original with dummy.

337
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,689
Look there sir.
- Where?- There!

338
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:18,127
Bill Gates too is bombed!
- Go to ninth floor. go!

339
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:20,204
Watch out!

340
00:34:21,308 --> 00:34:24,971
lf l don't prove you're a cheat.
henceforth my name shall not be Geetha.

341
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,874
lf you've guts. you must write the letter.
not use services of someone else.

342
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,915
Sorry for writing the letter
with my left hand.

343
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:36,887
when will you give the opportunity
to write with my right hand?

344
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,567
Geetha. come l'll give you lift.

345

Everyone would've believed it.

Do you know how you impressed
me for the first time?

349
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:17,220

Where is my car?

358
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,229

00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:46,872
Lower your voice.

Yes sir. 666 is my car number only sir.

369

Why is he emptying it into the sink?

376
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:30,599
Mixing it.

Somebody has lost a cell phone.

00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:04,954
Poor girl has hallucination problem.

387
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:07,289
She imagines what had happened
as not happened and vice versa.

388
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,332
Sir. he really touched me.

389

394
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:38,090
Feelings were shattering. babe.

All the kick has come down.
Start the car.

401
00:42:18,938 --> 00:42:21,031
Put him in back.
- Okay. go back.

402
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:25,139
Push...
- You pull!

403
00:42:50,003 --> 00:42:51,163
Run boys!

404
00:43:02,548 --> 00:43:06,382
Must tear the red shirt!

405
00:43:34,747 --> 00:43:38,410
French beard guy mustn't
see this world again.

406
00:44:15,788 --> 00:44:21,784
Guy with ear ring must lose his ring!

407
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:49,148
Must break the head of the skinhead!

408
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:33,363
For this tidal wave of love...

409
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:35,941
Why just a fist size of heart?

410
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:38,507
For this unknown happiness...

411
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:41,239
Why does it need a language?

412
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,941
For this sweet pain...

413
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:46,685
Why the tears are salty?

414
00:45:46,854 --> 00:45:49,254
For even a blink's distance...

415
00:45:49,424 --> 00:45:51,517
Why one gets dejected?

416
00:45:51,692 --> 00:45:54,752
For the eyes that see you...

417
00:45:54,929 --> 00:45:57,420
Why does it need this world?

418
00:45:57,598 --> 00:45:59,862
For four letter word...

419
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:02,931
Why so many punishments?

420
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:08,533
Though I stop breathing...

421
00:46:10,378 --> 00:46:13,370
Though I am dead...

422
00:47:26,454 --> 00:47:28,752
You come into my eyes...

423
00:47:28,923 --> 00:47:31,517
You cut my dreams...

424
00:47:31,692 --> 00:47:36,789
You kill me once atleast
every second...

425
00:47:36,964 --> 00:47:39,626
You're cool like snow...

426
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,325
But you burn me like fire...

427
00:47:42,503 --> 00:47:47,600
You chase me and
burn my heart to ashes...

428
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:50,005
If you take a breath...

429
00:47:50,344 --> 00:47:52,835
My life span will increase, my love...

430
00:47:53,014 --> 00:47:58,111
Don't pierce into my heart
like a thorn...

431
00:48:49,637 --> 00:48:51,969
Falling like rain drops to touch you...

432
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:54,664
If it wants to shine...

433
00:48:54,842 --> 00:48:59,870
Shall I gather the clouds
and burn it down?

434
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:05,417
If parrots repeat your words...

435
00:49:05,586 --> 00:49:10,580
Shall I bury it to go silent?

436
00:49:10,758 --> 00:49:13,124
If flowers wish to touch you...

437
00:49:13,461 --> 00:49:15,861
I'll cut down the garden...

438
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:21,400
If any eye dares see you,
I'll pluck them out...

439
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:31,905
3 months rigorous imprisonment.

440
00:49:34,749 --> 00:49:35,408
Life sentence

441
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:24,379
Break the car of the man
who gave lift to her.

442
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:27,777
Will you break a car
if anyone gives me lift?

443
00:50:28,121 --> 00:50:29,748
Who do you think he is?
My house owner.

444
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,752
He'll ask me to vacate the flat.

This is AJ office. right?

You're wasting my time.

Owners are in foreign

This is sofa and that's TV.
Did you see how l found it?

Candle is on the tea table.

Milk is boiling on the stove.

468
00:52:23,804 --> 00:52:25,669
lt means nothing had happened.

469
00:52:32,712 --> 00:52:33,838
My mind sees things
which didn't happen and

470
00:52:34,181 --> 00:52:37,981
doesn't see things happening.
and flies away.

471
00:53:16,623 --> 00:53:19,751
l'm not able to judge myself.

472
00:53:19,926 --> 00:53:22,486
Sometimes l feel it's hallucination.
sometimes not.

473
00:53:22,662 --> 00:53:25,995
l feel you're here somewhere
at times and not sometimes.

474
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:29,302
l feel you're watching me.
that you're chasing me.

475
00:53:29,469 --> 00:53:30,902

476
00:53:31,238 --> 00:53:33,866
l feel like you're here
and watching me.

477
00:53:35,442 --> 00:53:37,501
l feel like you're watching
and smiling at me.

478
00:53:41,882 --> 00:53:43,042
Will you have an egg?

479
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,419
Egg vanished!

480
00:53:48,788 --> 00:53:52,053
Egg vanished!

481
00:53:52,592 --> 00:53:56,289
Do you say Arya came to your
home to steal an egg?

482
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:58,727
ls Arya not in a situation
to buy an egg?

483
00:53:58,899 --> 00:54:02,767
We can't lodge a complaint with
police about egg theft. right?

484
00:54:19,653 --> 00:54:23,612
Only you know l smoke and drink.

00:54:28,295 --> 00:54:31,787
Very good boy!
You selected a perfect place.

l'll teach you a lesson.

488
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:40,638
No use in telling them.
because nobody would believe it.

489
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:44,909
l'm myself confused
if you're here or not.

490
00:54:45,078 --> 00:54:46,739
How can they believe me?

491
00:54:47,614 --> 00:54:51,311
Why did you stop?
Please have your drink.

492
00:54:52,585 --> 00:54:57,420
Wine in one hand & chicken in another
and cigarette between fingers.

Am l creating all this because
he's ignoring me?

522
00:57:52,832 --> 00:57:59,169
Don't spend your life in dreams.

523
00:58:00,807 --> 00:58:02,274
Egg vanished?!

524
00:58:02,642 --> 00:58:05,167
lt didn't. had a full bottle and dozing.

525
00:58:05,512 --> 00:58:07,776
Claims to have earned ten degrees.

00:58:07,947 --> 00:58:09,244
Give me your cell.

527
00:58:09,616 --> 00:58:14,315
Not to break it but to take photos.
l must show everyone in office.

528
00:58:16,523 --> 00:58:19,959
Please don't disturb him.

529
00:58:25,532 --> 00:58:28,126

530
00:58:31,905 --> 00:58:33,964
What is Geetha doing in your flat?

531
00:58:37,043 --> 00:58:39,136
Why is Geetha in your flat?

532
00:58:53,726 --> 00:58:55,717
This is Geetha's flat!
You are here! Why are you here?

533
00:58:55,895 --> 00:58:57,760
How can you be in Geetha's flat?

534
00:58:57,931 --> 00:59:01,765
No dear. this is indeed your flat.

535
00:59:01,935 --> 00:59:03,732
my pulse is racing.

536
00:59:03,903 --> 00:59:06,167

00:59:06,339 --> 00:59:08,739

Come here. will anyone give

00:59:36,638 --> 00:59:38,833
How was l?
How you've turned me?

542
00:59:40,775 --> 00:59:43,209
Really you've made me a jerk.

543
00:59:46,381 --> 00:59:48,849
Love? ls this love?

544
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,817
Would anyone in this
world love like this?

545
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:54,610
No Geetha. the world knows me
as a good boy only.

546
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:57,519
l wanted to show only you
my other bad side.

547
00:59:57,692 --> 00:59:59,489
lf you love me. l wanted you
to love my bad too.

548
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:04,394
l really felt to be
my true self before you.

549
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,567
Do you really love me?

550
01:00:10,304 --> 01:00:12,397
Then. accept the truth before all.

551
01:00:12,573 --> 01:00:14,404
Accept you did all this.

552
01:00:15,076 --> 01:00:16,407
lmpossible.

553
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:19,671
lf l'm proven bad. l must leave office
and everyone there.

554
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:23,249
Then. do one thing. express your
love for me before all.

555
01:00:23,418 --> 01:00:25,443
nobody will misunderstand us then

556
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:30,589
You accept first.
then l'll express my love.

557
01:00:44,305 --> 01:00:46,535
My best friend Ajay.

558
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,539
l swear on him.

559
01:00:50,712 --> 01:00:52,441
What l say is truth.

560
01:00:53,815 --> 01:00:57,114
l kissed Geetha in lift.

561
01:01:00,121 --> 01:01:03,284
l wrote the love letter.

562
01:01:03,758 --> 01:01:06,921
Not only that l smoke cigarettes.

563
01:01:07,395 --> 01:01:08,555
l drink.

564
01:01:09,263 --> 01:01:13,131
l don't have any vision problem.

565
01:01:13,434 --> 01:01:14,799
l can see everything clearly.

566
01:01:15,636 --> 01:01:18,127
l made Geetha to come to my flat.

567
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,903
Who sir?
- Me!

568
01:01:21,609 --> 01:01:23,201
l feel like Arya is accepting the truth.

569
01:01:23,377 --> 01:01:24,571
Arya is really accepting all his deeds.

570
01:01:24,746 --> 01:01:26,646
Then you're also hallucinating.

571
01:01:27,882 --> 01:01:29,747
Why l did all this because...

572
01:02:17,465 --> 01:02:20,366
l had to express my love for you
to escape from him.

573
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,471
Anyway he hung his head in
shame before everyone for me.

574
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:31,745
l felt pity on him.

575
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:35,378
Do you think he really
loves me so much?

576
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:37,975
l don't know l'm confused.

577
01:02:38,352 --> 01:02:42,755
First when l saw him l was impressed
with his sincerity and perfection.

578
01:02:42,924 --> 01:02:47,384
To tell you the truth. may be l would've
loved him had he remained like that.

579
01:02:50,231 --> 01:02:52,563
But he tortured me a lot.

580
01:02:52,733 --> 01:02:55,668
Will he break car
if anyone gives me lift?

581
01:02:55,937 --> 01:02:57,905
lf l say anything. he says it's love.

582
01:02:58,539 --> 01:02:59,836
How am l to believe him?

583
01:03:00,808 --> 01:03:04,869
Do you know why l feel his
love may be true?

584
01:03:05,046 --> 01:03:06,741
Seeing your friendship.

585
01:03:06,981 --> 01:03:08,846
He loves you.

586
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:11,451
l told l love for that only.

587
01:03:11,619 --> 01:03:13,917
lf l tell that to anyone else.
he'll harm them.

588
01:03:14,255 --> 01:03:16,416
lf it is you. he'll not harm you.

589
01:03:23,998 --> 01:03:25,761
He may harm me also.

590
01:03:26,901 --> 01:03:32,601
Because he knows l love you.

591
01:04:16,017 --> 01:04:18,918
The same masked car hit Ajay
which l told you about.

592
01:04:21,422 --> 01:04:22,480
lsn't it him?

593
01:04:24,325 --> 01:04:25,485
lsn't it him?

594
01:04:29,864 --> 01:04:31,661
Leave it. nothing happened to me.

595
01:04:31,832 --> 01:04:33,993
What if anything had happened?
- Nothing happened. right?

596
01:04:34,335 --> 01:04:35,859
What if anything had happened?

597
01:04:42,343 --> 01:04:46,473
To escape from you l told
Ajay that l love him.

598
01:04:46,647 --> 01:04:50,105
lsn't Ajay your best friend?
l thought you'll not harm him.

599
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:52,351
But you tried to kill him.

600
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:56,517
You don't know the value of friendship.
How can you know what is love?

601
01:04:57,658 --> 01:05:00,525
l'm telling you now...

602
01:05:03,998 --> 01:05:08,162
What will you do now?
Will you kill him? Kill him.

603
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:18,543
Where are you going?
- Arya. stop...- Let him go...

604
01:05:26,887 --> 01:05:28,878
You don't know he's very sensitive.

605
01:05:55,149 --> 01:05:56,776
How did it happen?

606
01:05:57,418 --> 01:05:58,942
lf you ask how it happened...

607
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,782
When you kissed Geetha.
she came to me for solace.

608
01:06:01,956 --> 01:06:04,754
l pacified her.
l always pacified her friendly.

609
01:06:04,925 --> 01:06:05,949
but she misunderstood me.

610
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:08,595
l'm not asking that but
about the accident.

611
01:06:08,796 --> 01:06:12,095
Accident? l was parking the car...
parked the car.

612
01:06:12,433 --> 01:06:13,923
suddenly a car came
from behind and hit me.

613
01:06:14,101 --> 01:06:15,898
l almost got down from car
after parking it.

614
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:18,937
But l couldn't see...
- Why didn't you tell me?

615
01:06:19,907 --> 01:06:22,603
Didn't tell you...
l was thinking of calling you but...

616
01:06:22,777 --> 01:06:25,439
But my phone got broken.
l wasn't conscious too.

617
01:06:25,613 --> 01:06:28,776
Not that. why didn't you tell me
about pacifying Geetha?

618
01:06:28,949 --> 01:06:32,441
l thought of telling you but...
- Why didn't you tell me?

619
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:36,112
Situation didn't raise...
- Why didn't you tell me?

620
01:06:36,457 --> 01:06:38,857
l mean...because....

621
01:06:39,026 --> 01:06:41,654
l didn't tell you...
l didn't tell you wantonly.

622
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:44,127
Because l wanted you to hurt Geetha.

623
01:06:44,465 --> 01:06:46,126
The day you kissed her.
she came to me and cried.

624
01:06:46,467 --> 01:06:47,092
l pacified her.

625
01:06:47,268 --> 01:06:50,066
Everytime you hurt her.
she came to me.

626
01:06:50,237 --> 01:06:52,865
lt means if Geetha has to come close to me.
you must keep on hurting her.

627
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:53,904
that's why l didn't tell you.

628
01:06:54,075 --> 01:06:55,770
l don't know if Geetha
loves me or not.

629
01:06:55,943 --> 01:06:57,001
but she's angry on you.

630
01:06:57,178 --> 01:06:59,942
l wanted to turn that hatred
into my love and l succeeded.

631
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:02,810
She said l love to me
getting angry on you.

632
01:07:02,983 --> 01:07:05,577
l wanted to turn it real.
so l created this accident.

633
01:07:05,753 --> 01:07:08,813
l proved that you don't
value friendship too.

634
01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:10,820
she really expressed
her love for me.

635
01:07:11,492 --> 01:07:13,483
How can l agree if you spin
a coin and claim Geetha?

636
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:16,653
lt means you cheated me.
- Yes l cheated you.

637
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:39,312
You cheated your best friend
for Geetha. what a great love!

638
01:07:39,887 --> 01:07:42,048
l didn't get any doubt.
l'm shocked.

639
01:07:42,223 --> 01:07:44,885
l too didn't get any doubt.
you're great.

640
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:46,686
That's why you're number one.

641
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:54,031
Why didn't you tell me all these days?
Bloody idiot!

642
01:07:54,668 --> 01:07:57,330
Geetha is here! Come...come...

643
01:07:58,806 --> 01:08:00,068
One minute.

644
01:08:00,241 --> 01:08:03,335
Geetha expressed her love for you.
did you express your love for her?

645
01:08:03,677 --> 01:08:07,135
Didn't express? Bloody. she may feel bad.
express it right now. Come.

646
01:08:08,149 --> 01:08:10,709
One minute. put your hand into it.
she may know the truth.

647
01:08:10,885 --> 01:08:14,548
Geetha expressed love for you
getting angry on me.

648
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:16,019
if she comes to know about hand.

649
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,215
what if she expresses her love
to me getting angry on you?

650
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,221
So. for the present Geetha
mustn't know this.

651
01:08:21,562 --> 01:08:23,723
l'll not tell her. promise.
you too don't tell her. promise.

652
01:08:23,898 --> 01:08:25,559
Okay? Come.

653
01:08:26,734 --> 01:08:31,364
Anyway l'm a love failure.
l'll be mock angry for few days.

654
01:08:31,705 --> 01:08:33,696
Even l don't talk to you.
you must come and talk to me.

655
01:08:33,874 --> 01:08:35,239
lf you say.
why are you like that Arya?

656
01:08:35,576 --> 01:08:39,239
l'll cool down. okay? Come.

657
01:08:40,181 --> 01:08:41,239
One minute.

658
01:08:42,049 --> 01:08:44,779
Nothing. if you express your
love to Geetha now.

659
01:08:44,952 --> 01:08:47,819
she'll become all yours.
l can't have any feelings for her.

660
01:08:47,988 --> 01:08:55,087
so for one last minute
l'll see her as my love.

661
01:09:10,277 --> 01:09:11,335
Over.

662
01:09:13,781 --> 01:09:14,941
Go and tell her.

663
01:09:27,261 --> 01:09:28,319
When did it happen?

664
01:09:30,664 --> 01:09:31,892
Which hospital?

665
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:35,400
What did the doctor say?

666
01:09:36,971 --> 01:09:39,371
What has she done?

667
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,071
What happened?

668
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:45,369
Shanthi has committed suicide.

669
01:09:47,715 --> 01:09:50,377
Doctors said they can say
anything after 24 hours only.

670
01:09:53,287 --> 01:09:56,085
She committed suicide hearing me
saying l love you to Geetha.

671
01:10:00,794 --> 01:10:02,762
How much she loved me?

672
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:06,163
Never once she expressed it to me.

673
01:10:13,707 --> 01:10:15,732
How is Shanthi?

674
01:10:18,812 --> 01:10:20,939
What's wrong with her?
She's doing fantastic!

675
01:10:21,115 --> 01:10:22,912
Why did you tell last night that
she had committed suicide?

676
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:26,246
What can l do? l almost cried seeing
you expressing love to Geetha.

677
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,819
lf l cry at a friend's love success.

678
01:10:27,988 --> 01:10:32,357
it will be depressing. so l cried
using Shanthi suicide as a ploy.

679
01:10:33,794 --> 01:10:35,989
Even now l want to cry.
But l don't have a reason.

680
01:10:36,163 --> 01:10:38,358
lt'll be good if anyone
commits suicide.

681
01:10:38,799 --> 01:10:42,326
Okay. had enough of drinks. come.
- Go away...go!

682
01:10:44,138 --> 01:10:45,833
What did l tell you?

683
01:10:46,006 --> 01:10:49,464
l said l'll be angry and you must
talk to me even if l don't.

684
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,209
Talk to me.

685
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:53,074
Okay. come then.

686
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:58,384
My best friend Ajay...

687
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,209
My lover Geetha...

688
01:11:00,387 --> 01:11:02,150
Their love is grand success.

689
01:12:03,182 --> 01:12:06,618
Gone...gone...my love is gone...

690
01:12:06,786 --> 01:12:10,449
Let it go...

691
01:12:13,593 --> 01:12:16,824
Gone...gone...the girl has gone...

692
01:12:17,163 --> 01:12:20,792
Let her go...

693
01:12:23,503 --> 01:12:26,904
Lights have gone...
story has changed...

694
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,266
It's darkness all the way...

695
01:12:30,443 --> 01:12:32,308
Victory from life slipped out...

696
01:12:32,478 --> 01:12:38,314
It left me alone...
Now it's fine...

697
01:13:21,194 --> 01:13:24,686
Glass will break...
Chain will get snapped...

698
01:13:24,864 --> 01:13:26,195
Rose will wither...

699
01:13:26,365 --> 01:13:28,526
Let it go...

700
01:13:31,637 --> 01:13:33,332
Pond will stay...

701
01:13:33,506 --> 01:13:34,871
Beauty will diminish...

702
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,505
Man also dies...

703
01:13:36,676 --> 01:13:37,870
Let love too go...

704
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:39,872
Successful lovers...

705
01:13:40,213 --> 01:13:41,703
Those who married...

706
01:13:41,881 --> 01:13:44,679
They remain in homes...

707
01:13:44,851 --> 01:13:48,548
Those who love and
fail in it rule the world...

708
01:13:48,721 --> 01:13:52,020
And shine bright in history...

709
01:15:16,774 --> 01:15:20,767
Go away from Geetha and Ajay

710
01:15:28,052 --> 01:15:29,246
Do your work!

711
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,488
To hell with software!

712
01:15:34,626 --> 01:15:36,719
For whom sir?
- Me!

713
01:15:37,161 --> 01:15:39,652
Look at Arya! Don't you feel
he's drunk and stuttering?

714
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,728
What?

715
01:15:44,602 --> 01:15:46,331
Don't you feel
he's coming towards us?

716
01:15:53,211 --> 01:15:55,509
l'm a fake and you're a fake.

717
01:15:57,415 --> 01:15:59,679
l felt like he slapped me.

718
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:08,691
To hell with best employee award!

719
01:16:20,038 --> 01:16:24,634
Must help Geetha and Ajay
before l go.

720
01:16:24,809 --> 01:16:25,798
What? Marriage fixed suddenly?

721
01:16:26,144 --> 01:16:27,577
l don't know. my father fixed it.

722
01:16:27,745 --> 01:16:29,440
Your marriage is your wish.
who is he to decide it?

723
01:16:29,614 --> 01:16:30,842
He loves me very much.

724
01:16:31,182 --> 01:16:32,513
lf he loves you.
will he force marriage on you?

725
01:16:32,684 --> 01:16:35,585
Why are you shouting on me?
What can l do?

726
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:40,485
l don't have any problems like this.

727
01:16:40,658 --> 01:16:42,819
Are you having a fight?

728
01:16:43,161 --> 01:16:44,492
Will you split?

729
01:16:45,763 --> 01:16:47,526
Have a cigarette. Ajay.

730
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:50,361
Smoke...oh no!
Geetha will get angry.

731
01:16:50,535 --> 01:16:53,231
She may think l'm giving cigarettes
and spoiling Ajay's health.

732
01:16:53,404 --> 01:16:55,235
l'll go away.

733
01:16:56,407 --> 01:16:58,602
What is Arya doing here?
Haven't you sent him out yet?

734
01:16:58,776 --> 01:17:02,075
He's my friend. leave him
- Friend? He tried to kill you.

735
01:17:02,246 --> 01:17:03,736
Do you still consider him as friend?

736
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:05,606
Shall we discuss about our problem?

737
01:17:05,783 --> 01:17:10,880
No. my best friend
and my best Geetha.

738
01:17:11,222 --> 01:17:15,852
marriage will happen if l come.
if you don't come still it will.

739
01:17:17,128 --> 01:17:22,327
My best friend
and my best Geetha.

740
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:25,765
marriage will happen if l come.
if you don't come still it will.

741
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:26,798
How would l know?

742
01:17:27,138 --> 01:17:29,402
l agreed for this marriage.
what's your problem?

743
01:17:29,574 --> 01:17:31,804
Who is on line?
- Look. what a beautiful couple.

744
01:17:32,143 --> 01:17:35,510
Who are you talking to?
- Your phone and your daddy.

745
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:37,177
Are you mad?

746
01:17:37,348 --> 01:17:39,612
Do you know who my dad is?
- Please forgive me.

747
01:17:39,784 --> 01:17:43,584
Are you from Rayalaseema?
Are you Raji Reddy's daughter?

748
01:17:43,755 --> 01:17:47,316
Ajay. l'm scared.
he's no ordinary factionist.

749
01:17:47,492 --> 01:17:50,518
l called him unnecessarily.
Shanthi. you please tell her.

750
01:17:50,695 --> 01:17:53,630
They will kill him and
l can't live without him.

751
01:17:53,798 --> 01:17:55,459
Hey you stop it!

752
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:57,430
Geetha. there's only
one solution to it.

753
01:17:57,602 --> 01:17:58,899
Tomorrow morning we are marrying.

754
01:17:59,237 --> 01:18:00,295
Marrying?

755
01:18:12,283 --> 01:18:13,648
Has Geetha come?
- Not yet sir.

756
01:18:13,818 --> 01:18:16,946
Still last night's hangover isn't gone.

757
01:18:19,223 --> 01:18:21,214
Hey tuft! Move!

758
01:18:21,459 --> 01:18:22,653
Who is he?

759
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:25,489
What happened?
- Geetha hasn't come yet.

760
01:18:25,663 --> 01:18:27,893
Why?
Not interested?

761
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:33,402
Where are you?
Marriage time is almost...

762
01:18:33,571 --> 01:18:36,768
Marriage time?
You know where l'm? Rayalaseema.

763
01:18:37,241 --> 01:18:39,368
My people brought me
here overnight.

764
01:18:39,544 --> 01:18:42,877
l don't know what to do. Ajay?
l'm sacred.

765
01:18:43,214 --> 01:18:45,205
l'm coming. grandma.

766
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,635
Where are you going?
- To Kurnool.

767
01:19:12,243 --> 01:19:15,212
Kurnool? Why?
- To bring back Geetha.

768
01:19:15,379 --> 01:19:18,871
Are you mad?
Rayalaseema! They'll kill you.

769
01:19:19,217 --> 01:19:20,582
Let them kill me.
l can't live without Geetha.

770
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:22,946
You don't say like that.
l can't live without you.

771
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:25,380
l'll not let you go.
- What am l to do?

772
01:19:25,556 --> 01:19:27,353
They took her away because of you.

773
01:19:27,525 --> 01:19:28,753
Who will bring her back?

774
01:19:30,828 --> 01:19:31,795
Will you go?

775
01:19:31,963 --> 01:19:33,225
ldea is good. l'll go and
bring her back.

776
01:19:33,397 --> 01:19:34,386
No need. already you've done much.

777
01:19:34,565 --> 01:19:36,999
You said they took her away
because of me.

778
01:19:37,335 --> 01:19:38,802
l'll go there. stop that marriage
and bring her back.

779
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:43,566
No need. l'll go myself.
Heads. you win and l must go.

780
01:19:44,242 --> 01:19:47,769
lt's very danger for you there.

781
01:19:47,945 --> 01:19:49,776
this bag is for me
and this peg is for you.

782
01:19:49,947 --> 01:19:51,744
l'll bring back Geetha.

783
01:19:54,452 --> 01:19:58,786
You're not playing any drama
to pack me off. are you?

784
01:19:59,357 --> 01:20:03,088
Even if you do. l don't mind.
You're my friend. l'll believe you.

785
01:20:27,285 --> 01:20:30,311
Are you Arya?
- Yes.

786
01:20:30,488 --> 01:20:32,456
Geetha madam sent me for you. come.

787
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:37,058
Don't get scared. they are checking
if bombs will blast or not.

788
01:20:37,395 --> 01:20:40,455
Pick up that bag.
l don't have a hand. please.

789
01:20:41,966 --> 01:20:42,990
What happened to your hand?

790
01:20:43,334 --> 01:20:45,359
My friend tried to stop a marriage.

791
01:20:45,536 --> 01:20:46,833
they cut my hand because
l'm his friend.

792
01:20:47,004 --> 01:20:48,835
What about your friend?
- They took his head.

793
01:20:49,006 --> 01:20:51,634
That fresh grave is his.

794
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:53,577
Pour it.

795
01:20:53,744 --> 01:20:56,907
l'm scared about his reaction for
madam's friendship with men.

796
01:20:57,081 --> 01:20:58,844
talk to him carefully.

797
01:21:01,319 --> 01:21:02,547
Stop! Who is he?

798
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,915
Junior madam's friend.
he's coming from city.

799
01:21:05,089 --> 01:21:07,319
Why are you staring at him?
He came to attend her marriage.

800
01:21:07,491 --> 01:21:08,480
Give us way.

801
01:21:08,659 --> 01:21:10,854
Sir!- l cut your hand but
still haven't got sense.

802
01:21:11,028 --> 01:21:12,655
Why did you bring
a mischievous boy with you?

803
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:16,129
As far as l know madam
doesn't have any friends.

804
01:21:17,635 --> 01:21:19,330
Your native place?

805
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:23,501
Hyderabad.
- They both work in the same office.

806
01:21:23,674 --> 01:21:25,437
Send the boy here.

807
01:21:25,943 --> 01:21:26,671
Be careful.

808
01:21:26,844 --> 01:21:28,709
Go. boss is calling you.

809
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,848
Sir. tell me to whom should
l give after you're gone.

810
01:21:54,572 --> 01:21:58,008
Tell Venkat Reddy that
l told this. go.

811
01:22:00,378 --> 01:22:01,709
Who are you?

812
01:22:21,651 --> 01:22:24,313
Stop...stop....listen to me.
After you do anything.

813
01:22:24,487 --> 01:22:28,548
l said l'm Geetha's lover but
didn't say Geetha too loves me.

814
01:22:28,725 --> 01:22:30,022
Leave him.

815
01:22:33,529 --> 01:22:39,399
Yes sir. l love Geetha but
she never loved me.

816
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:44,502
l agreed bravely that l love Geetha
because of you sir.

817
01:22:44,774 --> 01:22:46,264
She told great about you sir.

818
01:22:46,442 --> 01:22:48,808
that you're marrying her to your
enemy Kasi Reddy's son.

819
01:22:48,978 --> 01:22:51,276
and two faction families are
uniting with this marriage.

820
01:22:51,447 --> 01:22:54,712
and that your decision will stop
the blood bath in this region.

821
01:22:54,884 --> 01:22:56,374
she told me great about you sir.

822
01:22:56,552 --> 01:23:00,921
You're making an enemy your relative.
l couldn't dare lie to you.

823
01:23:01,257 --> 01:23:04,055
that's why l told you the truth.

824
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:06,587
But your people could've
beheaded me in seconds.

825
01:23:06,763 --> 01:23:08,856
Why are you talking too much?
- Stop!

826
01:23:09,499 --> 01:23:11,763
Let him talk.
- This is your brashness.

827
01:23:11,934 --> 01:23:14,903
Sickles and bombs are still here.
Men are like that only.

828
01:23:15,071 --> 01:23:15,935
How can you bring peace?

829
01:23:16,272 --> 01:23:18,604
They tried to kill me
misunderstanding my one word.

830
01:23:18,775 --> 01:23:20,367
You've enmity for generations now.

831
01:23:20,543 --> 01:23:22,010
even if there's a small
misunderstanding.

832
01:23:22,345 --> 01:23:24,438
entire marriage will turn
into battlefield.

833
01:23:26,449 --> 01:23:29,612
l came here to attend marriage
but now l know.

834
01:23:29,786 --> 01:23:30,548
this marriage will not happen.

835
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,745
l told you earlier too
this marriage will not happen.

836
01:23:32,922 --> 01:23:35,288
How can we give our daughter
to our enemy in marriage?

837
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:36,288
You carry on.

838
01:23:36,459 --> 01:23:39,792
lf you forgive me.
l'll take leave now.

839
01:23:44,701 --> 01:23:45,463
Stop!

840
01:23:45,635 --> 01:23:47,466
We got furious hearing that
you're junior madam's lover.

841
01:23:47,637 --> 01:23:50,470
but we are not angry now.
See. drop the weapons.

842
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,335
We've changed.
- No. you can't change.

843
01:23:52,508 --> 01:23:54,373
We've changed. tell him boys.
- We've changed.

844
01:23:54,544 --> 01:23:58,810
Brother! Kasi Reddy's
men are coming!

845
01:24:00,483 --> 01:24:02,007
lndeed you've changed
completely brothers.

846
01:24:02,352 --> 01:24:04,786
Yes. he's right.

847
01:24:04,954 --> 01:24:07,855
These sickles and bombs
will be with us only.

848
01:24:08,024 --> 01:24:09,753
and we'll be like this only.

849
01:24:09,926 --> 01:24:12,520
this marriage will not happen
till we are like this.

850
01:24:12,695 --> 01:24:15,027
Whatever you say they are our
enemies. sir. can't trust them.

851
01:24:15,365 --> 01:24:18,129
No. this marriage must
go with trust.

852
01:24:18,468 --> 01:24:20,959
they must trust us and
we must trust them.

853
01:24:21,137 --> 01:24:22,570
drop your weapons first.

854
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:25,833
Not a sickle or bomb must
be there in my house.

855
01:24:26,008 --> 01:24:29,102
No sir...- Follow my order.
- Throw it.

856
01:24:32,548 --> 01:24:36,348
Why are you laughing?

857
01:24:36,619 --> 01:24:38,382
Do you think this marriage

858
01:24:38,554 --> 01:24:39,714
lt will happen.

859
01:24:39,889 --> 01:24:42,380
Stay here and
watch how it happens.

860
01:24:42,558 --> 01:24:47,154
He's our guest. take his luggage.
- Yes boss.

861
01:24:54,036 --> 01:25:00,635
l wanted to kill men here but now
l'm getting welcomed by them.

862
01:25:05,615 --> 01:25:09,107
Whatever it is. we must be careful
from our side.- Okay boss.

863
01:25:14,957 --> 01:25:17,949
We trust them.
but do they trust us?

864
01:25:18,127 --> 01:25:22,063
We must trust them and
they must trust us. you told us.

865
01:25:22,398 --> 01:25:23,729
Trust?

866
01:25:32,408 --> 01:25:37,971
Stop...stop...just a comb!
Comb...comb...

867
01:25:38,147 --> 01:25:41,207
Sickle...sickle...

868
01:25:42,118 --> 01:25:45,087
They really trust you very much.
- What is this Kasi Reddy?

869
01:25:45,421 --> 01:25:47,889
Are you surprized seeing us
with weapons in marriage?

870
01:25:48,057 --> 01:25:49,922
To give it up at your feet.

871
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:55,820
From today we are not enemies.
give up your weapons boys.

872
01:25:56,165 --> 01:26:00,761
Brother-in-law...no bombs. right?

873
01:26:01,604 --> 01:26:05,199
All of you hug each other.

874
01:26:08,878 --> 01:26:11,938
This isn't like happy hug
but security check.

875
01:26:13,516 --> 01:26:14,778
Enough of squeezing it. leave it.

876
01:26:14,951 --> 01:26:16,885
What are you doing?

877
01:26:17,053 --> 01:26:19,783
We've reached.
Looking after us well...

878
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,121
Got scared? Hot water is
ready for bath. come.

879
01:26:28,464 --> 01:26:31,058
l didn't get scared.
you got scared and scared me.

880
01:26:31,234 --> 01:26:34,260
Fools! We mustn't get scared.
We are grooms' side.

881
01:26:34,604 --> 01:26:37,698
This is black berry tree but
it's known as Geetha tree here.

882
01:26:37,874 --> 01:26:41,935
because she ate a berry and spit
the seed here which grew up.

883
01:26:42,111 --> 01:26:44,636
take video.
- Move aside.

884
01:26:45,515 --> 01:26:47,745
Geetha fell knocked down
by this threshold.

885
01:26:47,917 --> 01:26:51,478
Boss closed it because
it made Geetha to fall down.

886
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:54,145
Take video.- ls it?
- Take...- Get up.

887
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:56,048
l've been trying so much
to make her fall.

888
01:26:56,225 --> 01:26:57,817
did you make Geetha fall
when she was a little girl?

889
01:26:57,994 --> 01:26:59,484
Bloody idiot!

890
01:26:59,662 --> 01:27:02,756
To tell about this tub.
when Geetha was little...

891
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:06,160
Get my bag. l'll go away.

892
01:27:06,502 --> 01:27:08,163
lf you go away. l'll lose
my another hand too.

893
01:27:08,504 --> 01:27:09,664
Boss wants him to stay here.
He'll not go.

894
01:27:09,839 --> 01:27:11,670
Why is she calling me
like a servant?

895
01:27:11,874 --> 01:27:14,741
l came here to help and talk to me
affectionately and get things done.

896
01:27:14,911 --> 01:27:16,208
Tell her to call me affectionately.

897
01:27:16,546 --> 01:27:18,309
Please madam. do it.

898
01:27:20,116 --> 01:27:22,914
No feel in it.
Look. how l call you.

899
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,019
There's feel in it.
- Did you see?

900
01:27:26,188 --> 01:27:27,018
Try it.

901
01:27:28,524 --> 01:27:29,320
Not good.

902
01:27:29,559 --> 01:27:31,686
Keep on practicing.
You carry on.

903
01:27:32,161 --> 01:27:33,685
Not that. tell about this.

904
01:27:33,863 --> 01:27:37,026
Geetha used to take bath
everyday in this tub only.- Here?

905
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:38,530
As a little girl.

906
01:27:39,135 --> 01:27:40,602
Why are you taking the video?

907
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:44,331
l'm not doing it on my own.
Ajay asked me to do it. Come.

908
01:27:45,141 --> 01:27:49,043
There are many things of Geetha
like cycle. vessels. etc..

909
01:27:51,881 --> 01:27:52,711
Tell me.

910
01:27:53,182 --> 01:27:54,012
Tell me what's it?

911
01:27:54,183 --> 01:27:56,344
Did you ask to take video of things
connected with my childhood?

912
01:27:56,686 --> 01:27:58,347
Take video? Me?

913
01:27:59,221 --> 01:28:01,553
l sent him to stop the marriage.
what is he doing there?

914
01:28:01,724 --> 01:28:03,055
Give the phone to him.

915
01:28:16,272 --> 01:28:18,740
Geetha used to play mom and
dad game as a child.

916
01:28:19,942 --> 01:28:21,933
Geetha madam.
- With phone as a child too.

917
01:28:22,111 --> 01:28:23,908
lf l'm not wrong.
Geetha would've broken this phone.

918
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,741
How do you know it?

919
01:28:28,384 --> 01:28:29,749
Gold medal won as a kid?

920
01:28:29,919 --> 01:28:33,184
lt's not a gold medal
but it's shy coin.

921
01:28:33,589 --> 01:28:36,285
Go...go...
- No sir it is...

922
01:28:38,227 --> 01:28:39,387
Shy coin!

923
01:28:43,799 --> 01:28:46,393
Small bangles of Geetha
as a toddler.

924
01:28:48,371 --> 01:28:51,397
Small plait bells of Geetha
as a little girl.

925
01:28:52,274 --> 01:28:58,406
Small slippers of child Geetha...
Big foot!

926
01:28:58,814 --> 01:29:00,406
Big eyes!

927
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:02,278
Big Geetha!

928
01:29:05,054 --> 01:29:06,681
Ajay told me to film it.

929
01:29:06,856 --> 01:29:09,620
Ajay didn't ask you to film it.
l know it.

930
01:29:10,993 --> 01:29:15,794
He doesn't love me so much.
- No. he loves you very much.

931
01:29:16,065 --> 01:29:18,659
lf he did. he would've come.
why would he send you?

932
01:29:18,834 --> 01:29:20,825
lf he doesn't come
it means he doesn't love you.

933
01:29:21,003 --> 01:29:22,630
Do you know how much
he loves you?

934
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:26,037
Do you know it?
- l know.

935
01:29:26,626 --> 01:29:31,723
As much as anger you felt on
seeing me for the first time...

936
01:29:31,898 --> 01:29:36,858
As much as hatred you had
when I talked to you first time...

937
01:29:37,370 --> 01:29:42,239
As sinful as I kissed you first time...

938
01:29:42,408 --> 01:29:47,402
As much of relief as you felt
when I told you the truth...

939
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:50,909
No...

940
01:29:57,924 --> 01:30:02,588
As much as light spreads
early morning in the village...

941
01:30:03,363 --> 01:30:07,857
As much as the milk foam
sticking to the calf's mouth...

942
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:13,531
As delicious as eating
a local delight...

943
01:30:13,706 --> 01:30:17,767
As desirous as a young girl
wishing for marriage...

944
01:30:40,466 --> 01:30:45,028
As lovely as the rap of a mother
when you're mischievous...

945
01:30:45,672 --> 01:30:50,473
As much as the flowers blooming
to spread colour...

946
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:56,940
As much fear as a poor
dull student facing exams...

947
01:30:57,116 --> 01:31:00,813
As brave as a heroic warrior
facing the might of an army...

948
01:31:22,675 --> 01:31:25,143
As lively as a standing crop...

949
01:31:25,478 --> 01:31:27,878
As passionate as Ghantasala's songs...

950
01:31:28,047 --> 01:31:33,007
As mouth watering as the
delicacies during festivals...

951
01:31:33,353 --> 01:31:35,821
As deep as the sleep
of Kumbhakarna...

952
01:31:35,989 --> 01:31:38,514
As long as Lord Hanuman's life...

953
01:31:38,691 --> 01:31:41,057
As much as the black Lord Krishna...

954
01:31:41,394 --> 01:31:43,157
As much as his chant...

955
01:32:31,778 --> 01:32:34,008
As bitter as neem...

956
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:36,740
As troublesome as the
village settlement place...

957
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:41,979
As confusing as the holy Veda...

958
01:32:42,155 --> 01:32:44,715
As beautiful as the moon's
reflection in the pond...

959
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:47,223
As festive as the yearly festival...

960
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:51,929
As thunderous as in
an open air theatre...

961
01:33:19,489 --> 01:33:21,286
Get up...get up...

962
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:24,291
What are you doing?
- Geetha has come.

963
01:33:24,461 --> 01:33:26,759
Do you've any idea of
stopping this marriage?

964
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:30,195
Are you playing here with dog while
arrangements are going on there?

965
01:33:30,367 --> 01:33:31,959
Will this dog stop this marriage?

966
01:33:39,243 --> 01:33:43,475
He's Sathi Reddy. my...
- l know him. he killed my Veera Reddy.

967
01:33:43,647 --> 01:33:44,375
How are you doing?

968
01:33:44,548 --> 01:33:47,847
Hadn't we become kinsmen.
l would've killed him first.

969
01:33:48,185 --> 01:33:49,812
Take a photo.

970
01:33:49,987 --> 01:33:51,511
Geetha is coming.

971
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:54,521
Sister-in-law is coming.

972
01:34:08,472 --> 01:34:11,373
Ajay's love...Ajay's love...

973
01:34:49,346 --> 01:34:52,577
They trust you very much. brother.

974
01:34:52,783 --> 01:34:55,911
Not trust. they wet pants on seeing us.

975
01:34:56,553 --> 01:34:58,043
Bloody cover up.

976
01:35:16,039 --> 01:35:18,030
Stop! Don't eat!

977
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:21,344
Brother. those bastards
poisoned the food.

978
01:35:21,511 --> 01:35:23,945
The dog died.

979
01:35:25,615 --> 01:35:29,949
Where is Raji Reddy? Get him.
Ask him to come here.

980
01:35:30,287 --> 01:35:31,777
What happened Kasi Reddy?

981
01:35:31,955 --> 01:35:34,981
Have you lost the courage to face us?

982
01:35:35,325 --> 01:35:39,785
Will you poison food to kill us?
Look. the dog died.

983
01:35:46,069 --> 01:35:49,300
No. we didn't do anything.
We didn't poison the food.

984
01:35:49,473 --> 01:35:52,806
Stop your drama. l thought your
compromise was genuine.

985
01:35:52,976 --> 01:35:54,876
l didn't expect you'll backstab us.

986
01:35:55,045 --> 01:35:57,980
You ruined our honour.
What a lousy life is yours!

987
01:35:58,315 --> 01:36:01,580
Kasi Reddy. you're crossing the limit.

988
01:36:01,752 --> 01:36:05,654
l killed 20 people in one shot.

989
01:36:06,757 --> 01:36:09,123
l don't need to kill anyone with poison.

990
01:36:09,659 --> 01:36:13,993
if there had been any lapse.
l'm ready to sacrifice my life first.

991
01:36:14,331 --> 01:36:15,764
tell me what do you want me to do?

992
01:36:15,932 --> 01:36:19,333
l'll tell you. bring the
food eaten by dog.

993
01:36:21,471 --> 01:36:24,338
Eat...it's not poisoned. right?
Eat!

994
01:36:25,675 --> 01:36:29,372
Stop sir...how can you
eat dog's leftover?

995
01:36:29,546 --> 01:36:34,074
No. if l don't eat it's like proving
their accusation right.

996
01:36:34,418 --> 01:36:41,517
l don't want to be blamed for
poisoning guests unable to face them.

997
01:37:08,985 --> 01:37:12,443
Do you trust me now?
- How did the dog die then?

998
01:37:12,622 --> 01:37:14,522
Where is the dog?
- lt left long back. boss.

999
01:37:14,691 --> 01:37:16,682
Bloody idiot!

1000
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:21,058
l trust you. dog is alive
and you're alive.

1001
01:37:21,398 --> 01:37:23,559
trust is more important.
we are ready for the marriage.

1002
01:37:23,733 --> 01:37:25,064
Priest. chant the hymns.

1003
01:37:25,402 --> 01:37:27,870
Marriage band. carry on playing.
Come boys. let's eat.

1004
01:37:28,038 --> 01:37:31,906
No Kasi Reddy.
this marriage will not happen.

1005
01:37:35,545 --> 01:37:37,103
l thought you came trusting me.

1006
01:37:37,447 --> 01:37:39,677
l didn't think you'd come with mistrust.

1007
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:46,221
even in the last moment. l expected
to hear you say. l trust you.

1008
01:37:46,556 --> 01:37:49,753
My daughter will not be happy
where there is mistrust.

1009
01:37:50,193 --> 01:37:52,184
Go away...go away...

1010
01:37:52,529 --> 01:37:55,623
l didn't come to you seeking peace.

1011
01:37:55,799 --> 01:37:59,565
My son liked your daughter.
so l agreed for this marriage.

1012
01:37:59,736 --> 01:38:02,102
but l expected something
will go wrong.

1013
01:38:02,506 --> 01:38:04,201
That's why l've come ready.

1014
01:38:04,541 --> 01:38:05,769
Father!

1015
01:38:09,546 --> 01:38:11,878
l want Geetha.

1016
01:38:14,985 --> 01:38:17,886
Bring her.
Let peace prevail!

1017
01:38:18,522 --> 01:38:22,117
Father. keep the knife away.

1018
01:38:22,459 --> 01:38:25,257
Father...
- Take her inside.

1019
01:38:25,729 --> 01:38:27,196
He's trouble. keep him away.

1020
01:38:27,531 --> 01:38:28,828
How can she come without
brandishing a knife?

1021
01:38:28,999 --> 01:38:30,227
How can you marry her?
Go!

1022
01:38:30,567 --> 01:38:33,468
Father...l can't stand him.
Put him in that vehicle. go.

1023
01:38:33,637 --> 01:38:35,867
Get that fool into the vehicle.

1024
01:38:39,976 --> 01:38:44,276
What ever it may be. you made
him eat dog's leftover food.

1025
01:38:45,715 --> 01:38:47,774
l wished to brandish
a knife at Raji Reddy.

1026
01:38:47,951 --> 01:38:51,580
lt got fulfilled today. l wish
someone had taken a photo of it.

1027
01:38:51,755 --> 01:38:54,952
Boss. the city boy was taking photos.
l saw him.- ls it?

1028
01:38:55,125 --> 01:38:56,114
Catch it.

1029
01:38:56,293 --> 01:38:59,922
l'll make a big cut out of it
and hang it in my hall.

1030
01:39:14,811 --> 01:39:16,904
Why? Why did you get into this bus?

1031
01:39:18,582 --> 01:39:20,015
Get down.

1032
01:39:20,984 --> 01:39:23,578
l'm asking you to get down but
you're turning back to see.

1033
01:39:29,059 --> 01:39:31,323
Get down! Get down!

1034
01:39:41,237 --> 01:39:43,865
Kill him boys!

1035
01:41:02,052 --> 01:41:06,421
Bloody idiots! Where's my wife?

1036
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:11,393
Raji Reddy! Are you happy that
your daughter returned home?

1037
01:41:11,728 --> 01:41:13,423
Even now l won.

1038
01:41:13,763 --> 01:41:17,699
Because your honour has
gone to the dogs.

1039
01:41:17,867 --> 01:41:22,736
How shameful if Raji Reddy's daughter's
marriage cancels at last moment?

1040
01:41:22,906 --> 01:41:25,636
Were you watching fun when
they took away my wife?

1041
01:41:25,809 --> 01:41:28,004
l'll kill anyone who marries her.

1042
01:41:28,178 --> 01:41:32,046
Bloody bastard! l would've saved her
if l had been there. Bloody!

1043
01:41:35,952 --> 01:41:38,819
Beat me with slipper
if you don't marry her.

1044
01:41:39,355 --> 01:41:43,223
Your daughter will live if she
becomes my daughter-in-law.

1045
01:41:43,393 --> 01:41:45,657
or else she'll become a widow.

1046
01:41:45,829 --> 01:41:47,353
Always a widow!

1047
01:41:54,738 --> 01:41:58,230
You talked about peace and
staked your daughter's life.

1048
01:41:58,408 --> 01:42:01,434
l warned you against this marriage.
You never listened to me.

1049
01:42:01,845 --> 01:42:04,871
My grand daughter said she'll marry
any dog also other than him.

1050
01:42:05,048 --> 01:42:08,484
Yes father. l said no because
they are our enemies.

1051
01:42:09,686 --> 01:42:11,449
You don't feel sad. father.

1052
01:42:12,489 --> 01:42:14,047
Tell me now. l'll do whatever
you ask me to do.

1053
01:42:14,224 --> 01:42:17,022
They will not do anything. sir.
Bloody cowards!

1054
01:42:17,193 --> 01:42:19,320
Next time l'll cut them into pieces.

1055
01:42:19,496 --> 01:42:25,025
There's only one way. the marriage
must go on as scheduled.

1056
01:42:25,401 --> 01:42:28,859
Say yes boss. there are many
ready to marry her.

1057
01:42:29,038 --> 01:42:29,766
Grandma.

1058
01:42:29,939 --> 01:42:32,703
Ram Reddy's son is working
in Hyderabad.

1059
01:42:32,876 --> 01:42:35,174
He earns Rs.1 lakh a month.
He came to attend marriage.

1060
01:42:35,345 --> 01:42:38,143
Venkat Reddy's son...

1061
01:42:38,948 --> 01:42:41,439
Mal Reddy's son is also...

1062
01:42:42,018 --> 01:42:43,212
Anji Reddy's son...

1063
01:42:45,488 --> 01:42:46,512
Come here!

1064
01:43:03,206 --> 01:43:07,336
Will you marry my daughter?

1065
01:43:09,512 --> 01:43:10,911
l will sir.

1066
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,097
Take yellow rice.

1067
01:43:51,955 --> 01:43:54,185
Geetha is married.

1068
01:43:55,256 --> 01:43:59,454
Bloody fool! Marriage is over.
what are you doing here?

1069
01:43:59,627 --> 01:44:01,151
Watching her photo!

1070
01:44:01,329 --> 01:44:05,288
l want Geetha!- Are you mad.
- l want Geetha!

1071
01:44:05,466 --> 01:44:10,631
Want Geetha!
How to kidnap her from home?

1072
01:44:21,615 --> 01:44:23,810
Son...son...
- What happened mother?

1073
01:44:24,151 --> 01:44:26,813
Geetha is missing.
l searched everywhere.

1074
01:44:27,655 --> 01:44:28,485
Sir!

1075
01:44:46,173 --> 01:44:48,471
Ajay. listen to me.
- What will you say?

1076
01:44:48,642 --> 01:44:49,472
What did you say and
what have you done?

1077
01:44:49,643 --> 01:44:51,304
You promised to bring Geetha
but married her.

1078
01:44:51,479 --> 01:44:54,676
Please listen to me. one minute.

1079
01:44:57,651 --> 01:44:59,949
Leave me.
l married Geetha wantonly.

1080
01:45:00,287 --> 01:45:02,221
Else your father-in-law would've got
her married to some other man.

1081
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:04,551
Moreover she promised
to marry even a dog.

1082
01:45:04,725 --> 01:45:06,852
l've become that dog.

1083
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:09,888
Since l married her.
l could bring her to you.

1084
01:45:10,231 --> 01:45:12,722
Otherwise she would've
been in her in-laws place.

1085
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,595
You beat me unnecessarily.

1086
01:45:15,836 --> 01:45:18,703
Okay. first you go away from here.
Dangerous to be here.

1087
01:45:18,873 --> 01:45:20,738
Don't stay in lndia. go to US.

1088
01:45:20,908 --> 01:45:22,876
Your passports and
tickets are ready.

1089
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:25,269
As soon as you reach Hyderabad.
catch a flight to US.

1090
01:45:25,446 --> 01:45:27,505
Stay there for few days and
dust will settle down here.

1091
01:45:27,681 --> 01:45:30,377
l'll manage everything here.
You get the bag.

1092
01:45:33,554 --> 01:45:34,452
l misunderstood you.

1093
01:45:34,622 --> 01:45:37,216
That's okay. we can talk later.
first leave this place.

1094
01:45:37,391 --> 01:45:39,484
Dangerous to be here.
Go!

1095
01:45:39,727 --> 01:45:42,890
Not behind. this side.
Quick!

1096
01:45:55,242 --> 01:45:58,336
Dear. Geetha is missing.
Don't know where she has gone?

1097
01:45:58,512 --> 01:46:01,970
lf you know anything. your father-in-law
wants you to call this number.

1098
01:46:56,504 --> 01:46:59,837
Father-in-law. Geetha is in
railway station.

1099
01:47:28,335 --> 01:47:34,467
Stop...stop...
Stop it!

1100
01:47:34,642 --> 01:47:36,109
Stop! What are you doing?

1101
01:47:36,677 --> 01:47:37,439
Are you mad?

1102
01:47:37,611 --> 01:47:38,873
Who do you think he is?
He's my friend Ajay.

1103
01:47:39,046 --> 01:47:41,014
He informed about Geetha.
won't you bother to know details?

1104
01:47:41,348 --> 01:47:43,680
What?

1105
01:47:44,518 --> 01:47:46,042
Father-in-law. he's my friend Ajay.

1106
01:47:46,387 --> 01:47:48,116
He informed you about
Geetha's whereabouts.

1107
01:47:48,455 --> 01:47:51,618
He heard about my sudden
marriage and came to meet me.

1108
01:47:52,393 --> 01:47:54,361
Few moments late
it would've been disaster.

1109
01:47:54,528 --> 01:47:57,827
Forgive me sir. l found them
close and misunderstood it.

1110
01:47:57,998 --> 01:48:00,466
l told him to talk to her
till you come here.

1111
01:48:00,634 --> 01:48:03,660
What's this Tikki Reddy?
Sorry Ajay.

1112
01:48:05,406 --> 01:48:07,101
Forgive us. lt was our mistake.

1113
01:48:07,441 --> 01:48:09,500
We lost control not finding her.

1114
01:48:09,677 --> 01:48:12,043
Did you see how many problems
we had to face because of you?

1115
01:48:12,379 --> 01:48:14,108
Father-in-law. what could she do?

1116
01:48:14,448 --> 01:48:16,541
You didn't ask her opinion
before fixing marriage.

1117
01:48:16,717 --> 01:48:18,412
May be that's why
she left unable to adjust.

1118
01:48:18,586 --> 01:48:21,646
Nothing to worry. she'll adjust
as times passes.

1119
01:48:21,956 --> 01:48:23,048
Will you?

1120
01:48:24,091 --> 01:48:25,718
Let bygones be bygones.

1121
01:48:26,093 --> 01:48:27,651
you tasted our anger.

1122
01:48:27,828 --> 01:48:31,559
come to my home.
you can enjoy our hospitality too.

1123
01:48:31,732 --> 01:48:33,165
Yes. father-in-law is very good man.

1124
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:34,967
They respect guests. you'll see it.

1125
01:48:35,135 --> 01:48:39,572
Did you see sir?
How he supports our madam?

1126
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:41,840
My son-in-law is gold.

1127
01:48:43,644 --> 01:48:47,080
Thank God you came on time.
l'm totally confused.

1128
01:48:47,414 --> 01:48:49,405
lf you hadn't come on time...

1129
01:48:51,785 --> 01:48:54,686
How did they know we were
in railway station?

1130
01:48:57,224 --> 01:48:58,748
l told them.

1131
01:48:59,093 --> 01:49:01,857
Be careful!

1132
01:49:02,496 --> 01:49:06,694
l could sacrifice lover easily
but couldn't sacrifice wife so easily.

1133
01:49:06,867 --> 01:49:08,164
l couldn't bear losing Geetha.

1134
01:49:08,502 --> 01:49:11,801
in that confusion. l called father-in-law
and informed him.

1135
01:49:11,972 --> 01:49:14,770
Sorry. it'll never happen again.

1136
01:49:16,677 --> 01:49:21,114
Thank God. you agreed.

1137
01:49:21,949 --> 01:49:23,109
That's enough for me.

1138
01:49:23,617 --> 01:49:25,107
Our plan is wrong.

1139
01:49:25,452 --> 01:49:27,613
lf Geetha leaves alone.
father-in-law will get doubt.

1140
01:49:27,788 --> 01:49:28,948
he'll then...

1141
01:49:30,124 --> 01:49:33,685
He'll catch you easily.
lf we three go to Hyderabad.

1142
01:49:33,861 --> 01:49:36,591
if you both fly to US from there.
nobody would get any doubt.

1143
01:49:36,764 --> 01:49:38,732
This is correct for now. trust me.

1144
01:49:39,733 --> 01:49:42,964
Why are you still here?
Get ready quickly for the ring game.

1145
01:49:43,137 --> 01:49:44,536
l'm coming grandma.

1146
01:49:44,705 --> 01:49:46,969
Who is he?
- My best friend. grandma.

1147
01:49:47,141 --> 01:49:49,132
Be careful sunny! Don't trust friends.
they'll cheat you.

1148
01:49:49,476 --> 01:49:51,808
Okay granny.
About me.

1149
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:57,715
They want me to play ring game.
can l play?

1150
01:49:57,885 --> 01:49:59,978
No. then leave it.

1151
01:50:04,625 --> 01:50:09,653
Anyway l'm leaving Geetha to you.
l'll play just few games.

1152
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:11,798
Are you feeling bad?
lf you feel l'll not play.

1153
01:50:11,965 --> 01:50:15,298
Friendship is important.
no need of all that.

1154
01:50:18,205 --> 01:50:21,299
l'm going to feel all my life.
what's wrong if you feel for one day?

1155
01:50:23,610 --> 01:50:26,044
Ajay is my friend...

1156
01:50:26,213 --> 01:50:28,010
Feeling for one day is also feeling.

1157
01:50:29,717 --> 01:50:32,311
l managed to stop marriage.
this is nothing.

1158
01:50:32,653 --> 01:50:35,019
Son-in-law. everything is ready.
you must come now.

1159
01:50:35,189 --> 01:50:37,180
l'm coming. Come...

1160
01:50:44,031 --> 01:50:46,522
Look dear and you too. l'm going
to put this ring into the vessel.

1161
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:48,634
whoever takes it out
will rule the roost.

1162
01:50:48,802 --> 01:50:50,997
Play dear...it's wrong...
come on play dear...

1163
01:50:51,171 --> 01:50:53,833
Why are you adamant
like a little girl?

1164
01:50:54,007 --> 01:50:57,033
Father-in-law. you don't worry.
give me your phone.

1165
01:51:00,013 --> 01:51:04,677
lf you overact they may get doubt.
They will kill Ajay.

1166
01:51:04,852 --> 01:51:07,912
Then you may have to live
with me all your life. Play!

1167
01:51:08,255 --> 01:51:10,746
Priest. everything is ready.
Start the game.

1168
01:51:10,924 --> 01:51:12,289
Start!

1169
01:51:12,893 --> 01:51:15,828
But on one condition.
play with smile. Okay?

1170
01:51:18,232 --> 01:51:22,168
Son-in-law is magician.
he made madam smile so easily.

1171
01:51:26,273 --> 01:51:28,833
Don't laugh so much.
Ajay may feel bad.

1172
01:51:33,247 --> 01:51:36,239
Go and tell him. Go!

1173
01:51:36,583 --> 01:51:38,949
Two loads to Basava Reddy in Kurnool.

1174
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:42,247
four loads to Muni Reddy of Bagampalli.

1175
01:51:42,923 --> 01:51:45,915
ten loads to Veera Reddy...
- Father-in-law.

1176
01:51:47,261 --> 01:51:50,253
We are going to Hyderabad.
We have plenty of work in office.

1177
01:51:50,597 --> 01:51:53,327
Where will you go?
Tonight is your first night.

1178
01:51:53,667 --> 01:51:55,259

Please advice him.

01:52:19,893 --> 01:52:23,056
No? l told you to plan something.

1190
01:52:23,697 --> 01:52:26,131
Ever since marriage
l'm desiring Geetha.

1191
01:52:26,333 --> 01:52:28,426
l'm scared of betraying you.

1192
01:52:29,102 --> 01:52:31,798
l feel like giving up Geetha for you
and also take away from you.

1193
01:52:31,972 --> 01:52:35,965
l'm confused. l'm confused.
Come here.

1194
01:52:36,276 --> 01:52:37,436
Come here l say!

1195
01:52:38,645 --> 01:52:39,441
Take it.

1196
01:52:41,281 --> 01:52:44,148
What would you do if you
were in my place?

1197
01:52:45,986 --> 01:52:48,318
l would sacrifice Geetha.
- Then do it.

1198
01:52:50,724 --> 01:52:56,162
Why am l behaving so selfish?
Ajay is my friend...

1199
01:52:56,330 --> 01:52:59,663
No. our friendship is great.
No. l'll sacrifice.

1200
01:52:59,833 --> 01:53:02,825
Say something about friendship
and inspire me.

1201
01:53:03,003 --> 01:53:03,867
You mean what?

1202
01:53:04,037 --> 01:53:06,665
Tell me everything you did
for me since our childhood.

1203
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:07,829
Tell me...tell me...

1204
01:53:08,008 --> 01:53:09,100
As a child l gave you pencil.

1205
01:53:09,276 --> 01:53:10,971
Later you gave me pen also.
not such things.

1206
01:53:11,144 --> 01:53:12,668
l asked for childhood memories and
you're talking about trivial things.

1207
01:53:12,846 --> 01:53:13,471
Tell me something else.

1208
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:14,738
l came to station and
bailed you out.

1209
01:53:14,915 --> 01:53:16,382
l went to the police station
for you only.

1210
01:53:16,717 --> 01:53:18,810
Not that. say something else.

1211
01:53:18,986 --> 01:53:20,044
l offered you a job in my company.

1212
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:23,053
l own that company. not that.
say something else.

1213
01:53:23,223 --> 01:53:24,747
Tell me quickly.
try to recollect and tell me.

1214
01:53:24,925 --> 01:53:26,187
Say something.

1215
01:53:29,696 --> 01:53:33,188
lt means you haven't done
anything for me till now.

1216
01:53:33,967 --> 01:53:36,458
lt means l too needn't
do anything for you.

1217
01:53:37,938 --> 01:53:40,498
So l needn't sacrifice
Geetha for you.

1218
01:53:41,775 --> 01:53:44,141
Needn't sacrifice Geetha for you!

1219
01:53:44,778 --> 01:53:46,803
Needn't sacrifice Geetha for you!

1220
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:48,140
Father-in-law!

1221
01:54:17,648 --> 01:54:23,780
I'm a foreigner,
I came from foreign...

1222
01:54:34,699 --> 01:54:40,569
For proud young men,
I left Washington...

1223
01:54:51,148 --> 01:54:53,673
Got fed up boarding airbus...

1224
01:54:53,851 --> 01:54:56,411
I started liking red bus...

1225
01:54:56,587 --> 01:55:00,614
I reached red fort and
waited for him...

1226
01:55:00,791 --> 01:55:02,315
For whom?

1227
01:55:02,493 --> 01:55:04,654
I got fed up kissing
clean shaven men...

1228
01:55:04,829 --> 01:55:07,559
I searched for young men
with big moustaches...

1229
01:55:07,732 --> 01:55:13,193
I visited Bangalore,
Mangalore, Bihar, Jaipur...

1230
01:55:13,371 --> 01:55:16,272
But settled down in Rayalaseema...

1231
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:18,840
What did those men do with you?

1232
01:55:19,176 --> 01:55:24,910
They blasted my beauty with
a Cuddapah bomb...

1233
01:55:30,321 --> 01:55:35,987
They broke open the fencing of
virginity with sharp sickles...

1234
01:55:47,304 --> 01:55:52,264
O white maiden! That's all okay,
but what's this ringa ringa?

1235
01:55:52,443 --> 01:55:59,372
The real game is my original name...

1236
01:56:03,587 --> 01:56:09,389
Unable to spell it correctly,
they called me fondly as...

1237
01:56:14,465 --> 01:56:16,956
They stripped me off jeans and
made me wear half sari...

1238
01:56:17,301 --> 01:56:19,769
And made a big plait beautifully...

1239
01:56:19,937 --> 01:56:25,000
I was like a stone, they turned me
into a centre of pleasure...

1240
01:56:25,342 --> 01:56:28,038
They changed my English funnily...

1241
01:56:28,379 --> 01:56:30,904
They entered my home
from backdoor fiercely...

1242
01:56:31,248 --> 01:56:33,716
They took my life
without killing me...

1243
01:56:33,884 --> 01:56:36,478
They devoured my beauty...

1244
01:56:36,654 --> 01:56:39,851
They took away all my shyness...

1245
01:56:40,024 --> 01:56:42,288
Did they took away?
What else did they do?

1246
01:56:42,460 --> 01:56:44,928
They followed me like a birth mole...

1247
01:56:45,262 --> 01:56:48,629
They gave me new touches...

1248
01:56:53,571 --> 01:56:56,267
They fulfilled all my desires...

1249
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:59,034
They taught me to walk like queen...

1250
01:57:17,027 --> 01:57:20,656
Hey girl! How is our hero's power?

1251
01:57:20,831 --> 01:57:27,464
Young men in dhotis have
shown me the best...

1252
01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:38,471
I liked the men who pull out arrack...

1253
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:45,854
Tasteless pizza is useless...

1254
01:57:46,023 --> 01:57:48,685
Local food with onions is delicious...

1255
01:57:48,859 --> 01:57:52,989
I informed everyone
about it on phone...

1256
01:57:53,330 --> 01:57:54,126
Did you tell?

1257
01:57:54,465 --> 01:57:56,990
Big star hotels are boring...

1258
01:57:57,334 --> 01:57:59,802
Roadside tea stalls are great fun...

1259
01:57:59,970 --> 01:58:02,598
Hearing this girls from
Ireland, Greenland,

1260
01:58:02,773 --> 01:58:08,541
New Zealand, Netherlands,
Thailand, Finland landed here....

1261
01:58:08,712 --> 01:58:11,078
Landed here?
What should we do now?

1262
01:58:11,415 --> 01:58:17,513
Put hand over hand
and dial the land line...

1263
01:58:22,626 --> 01:58:28,121
I'll put hand over hand
and dial the land line...

1264
01:58:41,598 --> 01:58:42,656
Do you want to kill yourself
for not helping me?

1265
01:58:42,833 --> 01:58:44,892
Please don't jump. Ajay.
Please stop...don't jump.

1266
01:58:45,235 --> 01:58:47,760
0lf you jump. l'll not save you.
l'll let you die.

1267
01:58:48,105 --> 01:58:49,766
l've changed. You don't know to
swim also. foolish fellow.

1268
01:58:50,107 --> 01:58:50,835
You'll die instantly.

1269
01:58:51,174 --> 01:58:52,664
We are leaving to Hyderabad
tomorrow morning.

1270
01:58:52,843 --> 01:58:54,276
No. l'll not come. if l come
you'll take away my Geetha.

1271
01:58:54,444 --> 01:58:56,435
No need.
- No. don't jump.

1272
01:58:59,749 --> 01:59:00,807
Heads or tails?
- Tail.

1273
01:59:01,151 --> 01:59:03,642
Don't put useless conditions like
you win l win and l win you win.

1274
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:05,447
Whoever wins. it's theirs.
Heads.

1275
01:59:14,598 --> 01:59:18,796
Okay. we are going to Hyderabad tomorrow.
- Why? You won the toss.

1276
01:59:19,136 --> 01:59:20,330
l'll not change promises like you.

1277
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:23,505
What you win is mine
and what l win is yours.

1278
01:59:23,673 --> 01:59:24,935
Geetha is yours.

1279
01:59:28,678 --> 01:59:31,738
l asked you what did you do for me?

1280
01:59:32,282 --> 01:59:35,308
You're my friend. do you've to
do something for me?

1281
01:59:35,685 --> 01:59:38,654
Had you told me you were my friend?
That would've been enough.

1282
01:59:56,673 --> 01:59:58,573
Must handover Geetha to Ajay.

1283
01:59:58,742 --> 02:00:00,266
Bloody lovelorn son!

1284
02:00:00,443 --> 02:00:02,502
My daughter-in-law is
boarding train in station.

1285
02:00:02,679 --> 02:00:04,442
go and abduct her.

1286
02:00:09,486 --> 02:00:11,977
Will not spare him today.
He took away my wife.

1287
02:00:21,698 --> 02:00:23,529
They have just reached
the station. sir.

1288
02:00:25,335 --> 02:00:26,927
May you be blessed
a long life with your husband.

1289
02:00:28,471 --> 02:00:29,699
Be careful dear.

1290
02:00:32,642 --> 02:00:33,700
Just a minute.

1291
02:00:34,945 --> 02:00:36,810
Tie this to your husband.

1292
02:00:39,316 --> 02:00:41,716
Why?- According to your horoscope.
your husband will die young.

1293
02:00:41,885 --> 02:00:43,876
To ward off that defect. Tie it.

1294
02:00:44,554 --> 02:00:47,751
Don't disappoint her. tie it.
lt won't be nice.

1295
02:00:47,924 --> 02:00:50,950
You're not my husband.
lt won't affect you.

1296
02:00:52,262 --> 02:00:54,321
Granny. l asked and
she promised to tie in train.

1297
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:56,021
You don't mind it.

1298
02:00:56,499 --> 02:00:59,297
Don't feel sad.
Geetha will definitely love you.

1299
02:00:59,469 --> 02:01:02,529
because wife must
love her husband.

1300
02:01:02,706 --> 02:01:04,435
that's the wonder of marriage.

1301
02:01:04,608 --> 02:01:06,803
How can she love now
which she didn't all these days?

1302
02:01:06,977 --> 02:01:09,741
Mad boy! You don't need
years to sprout love.

1303
02:01:09,913 --> 02:01:13,371
Just a moment is enough.
You must wait for that moment.

1304
02:01:13,550 --> 02:01:14,574
That's all.

1305
02:01:15,552 --> 02:01:18,715
Be careful.
- Bye granny.- Bye.

1306
02:01:19,356 --> 02:01:20,755
Sir. your fish.

1307
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:24,420
Be careful.
- Bye.

1308
02:01:25,428 --> 02:01:28,420
How could l forget you gold fish?

1309
02:01:36,373 --> 02:01:40,434
Hey Tikki Reddy! Where is Ajay?
- He'll come. you go.

1310
02:01:42,579 --> 02:01:45,275
Father-in-law!
- You forgot your book.

1311
02:01:59,796 --> 02:02:03,027
Over. it's all over!

1312
02:02:03,833 --> 02:02:07,462
He'll kill...my father will kill Ajay.

1313
02:02:09,606 --> 02:02:11,836
My father will do anything for honour.

1314
02:02:12,008 --> 02:02:15,808
You were waiting to kill Ajay.
you will kill him.

1315
02:02:16,846 --> 02:02:18,871
You tried to kill him in an accident.

1316
02:02:19,049 --> 02:02:22,576
Now you wantonly left behind that book.
Wantonly!

1317
02:02:23,687 --> 02:02:27,987
l'm getting you now.
lf Ajay dies. no more hurdles.

1318
02:02:28,325 --> 02:02:31,817
We can live happily together.
lsn't that your intention?

1319
02:02:38,068 --> 02:02:41,936
lsn't she sad there?
Why are you disturbing her?

1320
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:43,667
Don't you've common sense?

1321
02:02:46,810 --> 02:02:51,076
You carry on Geetha. carry on.
- Are you mad?

1322
02:02:51,581 --> 02:02:54,141
Why are you feeling
for Ajay more than me?

1323
02:02:54,551 --> 02:02:55,381
You're just a lover.

1324
02:02:55,552 --> 02:02:58,851
do you know what he's to me?
Friend. my blood friend.

1325
02:02:59,055 --> 02:03:01,888
lf you're so sad for your lover.
how sad should l be for my friend?

1326
02:03:02,058 --> 02:03:02,956
Train has left. brother.

1327
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:05,526
Pull the chain after the second
bridge. we'll bump him off.

1328
02:03:05,862 --> 02:03:06,521
Okay brother.

1329
02:03:06,696 --> 02:03:09,688
l didn't expect this.
l'm worried about Ajay.

1330
02:03:09,866 --> 02:03:11,356
They will kill him.
Will they kill him?

1331
02:03:11,534 --> 02:03:14,094
Even if they think of killing Ajay.
l'll kill them.

1332
02:03:17,941 --> 02:03:21,707
Whatever it may be. my daughter-in-law
will come home today.

1333
02:03:21,911 --> 02:03:23,173
Turn my neck.

1334
02:03:29,652 --> 02:03:31,085
Who has come?

1335
02:03:32,789 --> 02:03:35,724
Who has come?
- That comb boy!

1336
02:03:38,628 --> 02:03:40,653
Stop! Stop!

1337
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:42,388
lf l had come here it means
l've something for you.

1338
02:03:42,565 --> 02:03:46,558
What's that?

1339
02:03:50,407 --> 02:03:51,931
Didn't l tell you my daughter-in-law
will come home?

1340
02:03:52,108 --> 02:03:54,872
You want Raji Reddy's daughter. right?
Take her.

1341
02:03:55,044 --> 02:03:56,568
l don't need her.
Keep her with you.

1342
02:03:56,746 --> 02:03:57,770
My father-in-law has kidnapped Ajay.

1343
02:03:57,947 --> 02:03:59,744
till he releases Ajay.
you don't release Geetha.

1344
02:03:59,916 --> 02:04:01,213
Till then keep her with you.

1345
02:04:01,551 --> 02:04:03,416
Hey stop...stop...Ajay?
Why should l release her?

1346
02:04:03,586 --> 02:04:06,646
l didn't get you.
- You don't know Ajay. right?

1347
02:04:06,823 --> 02:04:07,585
Geetha's lover.

1348
02:04:07,757 --> 02:04:09,816
Not Geetha's lover.
he's my blood friend first.

1349
02:04:09,993 --> 02:04:12,461
Then Geetha's lover.
Father-in-law has kidnapped him.

1350
02:04:12,629 --> 02:04:14,096
Unless he releases Ajay.
you mustn't release Geetha.

1351
02:04:14,431 --> 02:04:15,227
lf he refuses. you must also refuse.

1352
02:04:15,565 --> 02:04:17,226
Till then keep her with you.
let me see what he can do.

1353
02:04:17,567 --> 02:04:19,432
Son-in-law has joined us.

1354
02:04:19,602 --> 02:04:21,502
Hey stop...stop...l've a doubt.
- What?

1355
02:04:21,671 --> 02:04:24,970
Can't you threaten your father-in-law
keeping Geetha with you?

1356
02:04:25,141 --> 02:04:27,473
That one. l thought something else.

1357
02:04:27,644 --> 02:04:29,202
l love Geetha and father-in-law

1358
02:04:29,546 --> 02:04:32,982
lf she's with you. father-in-law will
fear you may harm her.

1359
02:04:33,149 --> 02:04:34,776
That's why l'm leaving her with you.

1360
02:04:35,118 --> 02:04:37,609
Stop...stop...you said another doubt.

1361
02:04:37,787 --> 02:04:40,119
Geetha is with you now.
You can do anything.

- Correct. l can do that.

1363
02:04:42,992 --> 02:04:44,220
But you can't.
- Why not?

1364
02:04:44,561 --> 02:04:45,255
For that you must have your son.

l do have.
- No. He's with me.- My...

1367
02:04:53,002 --> 02:04:55,470
True boss. our men are going in
an ambulance to hospital.

1372
02:05:04,948 --> 02:05:06,108
Should l cal you both?
- Yes.

1373
02:05:06,282 --> 02:05:08,682
But one condition.
father-in-law mustn't come there.

1374
02:05:08,852 --> 02:05:12,288
because l can't show him my face.
l can't face him.

1375
02:05:12,622 --> 02:05:15,056
Why are you staring at me?
l don't need you.

1376
02:05:15,225 --> 02:05:17,989
l need you only if he's there.
lf he's not there. l don't need you.

1377
02:05:18,828 --> 02:05:22,764
Look. your father is very dangerous man.
He'll take lives for honour.

1378
02:05:22,932 --> 02:05:26,299
lf anything happens to my Ajay.
your son will die.

1379
02:05:28,872 --> 02:05:33,036
He risked wife's life for a friend.
l like his character.

1380
02:05:37,046 --> 02:05:40,675
lf he can put wife's life in risk.
how much risk he'll take with my son?

1381
02:05:41,651 --> 02:05:45,314
l did all this for my friend.
You don't take it personal.

1382
02:05:47,690 --> 02:05:49,317
Do you drink?

1383
02:05:49,726 --> 02:05:51,694
Love failure. l'm sure you will.

1384
02:05:51,861 --> 02:05:53,590
Yours is faction family.

1385
02:05:53,763 --> 02:05:57,324
how could you fall in love with
Geetha amidst so much violence?

1386
02:05:57,700 --> 02:05:58,689
Where is he?

1387
02:06:01,538 --> 02:06:03,335

l felt l may die if
l don't love Geetha.

1390
02:06:10,246 --> 02:06:14,615
He's my type. We are same.
Lovers batch.

1391
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:17,878
Can one Geetha's lover kill
another Geetha's lover?

1392
02:06:23,826 --> 02:06:26,351
You left me as soon as
l told l'm Geetha's lover.

1393
02:06:27,196 --> 02:06:29,255
Your love is true.

1394
02:06:31,701 --> 02:06:33,066
What's this twist?

1395
02:06:33,570 --> 02:06:37,233
Father said l'm mad.
everyone said l'm mad.

1396
02:06:38,841 --> 02:06:41,241
But only you told mine is love.

1397
02:06:44,047 --> 02:06:47,073
Once more please.
- Subbi. your love is true.

1398

02:07:13,309 --> 02:07:17,268
What?
Did you see Geetha in long skirt?

1401
02:07:19,215 --> 02:07:22,810
10 years ago!
Then you're very senior.

1402
02:07:22,986 --> 02:07:24,977
You're elder brother and
l'm younger brother.

1403
02:07:25,154 --> 02:07:27,987
No. you're elder brother
and l'm younger brother.

1404
02:07:28,157 --> 02:07:30,921
You're elder brother and
l'm younger brother.

1405
02:07:31,094 --> 02:07:32,152
No. it's swear on Geetha.

02:07:32,328 --> 02:07:33,420
Brother.

1407
02:07:34,664 --> 02:07:36,791
We mustn't leave her. brother.

1408
02:07:36,966 --> 02:07:42,734
We must love Geetha so much
that we must sacrifice her also.

1409
02:07:42,905 --> 02:07:46,898
Sacrifice means?
- Sacrifice means forfeit.

1410
02:07:47,076 --> 02:07:48,839
lf you do...
- Will Geetha be happy?

1411
02:07:49,012 --> 02:07:52,641

02:07:56,953 --> 02:08:00,946
That's why let's give up Geetha to Ajay.

1414
02:08:01,124 --> 02:08:02,148
Who is Ajay?

1415
02:08:02,659 --> 02:08:06,288
Are you asking who is Ajay?
Ajay is my blood friend.

1416
02:08:06,462 --> 02:08:10,091
His love is greater than your love.
you know that?

1417
02:08:10,266 --> 02:08:12,928
l mean not greater than your love.

1418
02:08:13,102 --> 02:08:18,335
Geetha loves him. so he's great.
- Geetha loves him?

1419
02:08:18,675 --> 02:08:22,008
l fell for him. Geetha is nothing.
Come here.

1420
02:08:23,179 --> 02:08:29,345
He cheated me. his best friend
for Geetha. that's why he's great.

1421
02:08:29,686 --> 02:08:33,679
Cheating?
- Cheating means not exactly cheating.

1422
02:08:33,856 --> 02:08:37,019

fall in love with?

l...l disturb everyone.

1428
02:08:55,344 --> 02:08:59,041
lf l'm not there.
everyone would be happy.

1429
02:09:19,748 --> 02:09:25,812
We'll never let this friendship break...

1430
02:09:26,154 --> 02:09:32,821
We'll rather die than
break up with him...

1431

02:16:50,498 --> 02:16:53,626
Are you mad?
Why is she spoiling the entire plan?

1522
02:16:53,802 --> 02:16:55,167
Do you know how much trouble
her father can create if he knows?

1523
02:16:55,503 --> 02:16:56,970
How can you live
with her alone in US?

1524
02:16:57,138 --> 02:16:58,833
She has many tricks.

1525
02:17:48,089 --> 02:17:52,685
Before these moments die,
spend life happily...

1526
02:17:53,027 --> 02:17:57,760
Make it cherished
and memorable...

1527
02:17:58,099 --> 02:18:00,294
Eyes have become seas...

1528
02:18:00,468 --> 02:18:02,766
Waves of memories are
hitting the shores...

1529
02:18:03,104 --> 02:18:07,734
Dropping down from
eyes like tears...

1530
02:18:08,075 --> 02:18:10,407
Every passing minute is wounding...

1531
02:18:10,578 --> 02:18:12,773
Every wound has become a goal...

1532
02:18:13,114 --> 02:18:18,381
Those goals have become
milestones of my love...

1533
02:19:11,439 --> 02:19:16,206
I'm a river that got tired
running long distance...

1534
02:19:16,377 --> 02:19:21,246
Meandering into dusty sands
without reaching any seashore...

1535
02:19:21,415 --> 02:19:26,182
I'm a dream that
walked out of the eye...

1536
02:19:26,354 --> 02:19:30,882
I don't belong to
any of the two eyes...

1537
02:19:31,225 --> 02:19:35,594
Has my love turned into friendship?

1538
02:19:35,763 --> 02:19:40,791
Has my life become
an unanswered question?

1539
02:19:41,135 --> 02:19:45,902
Is there any name for
this relationship?

1540
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:51,303
If it is there, is there any
possibility to separate it?

1541
02:20:12,466 --> 02:20:15,902
Hey give the phone...
- Wait a minute...

1542
02:20:16,237 --> 02:20:18,171
Who do you think he is?
My husband!

1543
02:20:18,339 --> 02:20:21,502
If anyone hurts me, he'll kill you.
- Is it?...you...

1544
02:20:52,873 --> 02:20:54,864
What is it?

1545
02:20:56,477 --> 02:21:00,538
Before you both fly to US,
change garlands as I watch.

1546
02:21:00,715 --> 02:21:01,875
Please don't ask me why.

1547
02:21:02,216 --> 02:21:03,740
I must get the feeling that
you both are united.

1548
02:21:03,918 --> 02:21:08,548
Please, do this for me.
- Okay, do as you say.

1549
02:21:09,724 --> 02:21:13,717
Then I'll arrange for your marriage
in temple at 9 am. Okay?

1550
02:21:16,530 --> 02:21:17,724
Do you believe him?

1551
02:21:18,432 --> 02:21:21,526
9 am in temple?
It seems he wants to see us marry.

1552
02:21:21,702 --> 02:21:24,227
He has started another drama,
I don't believe him.

1553
02:21:24,405 --> 02:21:27,306
That's why I changed the plan,
we are going to Australia not US.

1554
02:21:27,475 --> 02:21:29,568
Not tomorrow evening,
tomorrow morning.

1555
02:21:30,311 --> 02:21:34,680
How can you cheat your friend?
- Look, he was never my friend.

1556
02:21:34,882 --> 02:21:38,750
I'm friendly with him so that he
won't harm us till we go from here.

1557
02:21:39,053 --> 02:21:40,987
And till we reach Australia....

1558
02:22:15,489 --> 02:22:18,049
Must make Geetha fondly
call my name Arya.

1559
02:22:25,163 --> 02:22:26,494
Why haven't you packed yet?

1560
02:22:26,999 --> 02:22:28,432
Didn't l tell you we are
leaving by morning?

1561
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:30,397
We'll not have time to pack
in the morning.

1562
02:22:30,569 --> 02:22:32,537
We must leave silently.
he mustn't even get slightest doubt.

1563
02:22:32,704 --> 02:22:34,171
He's too smart.

1564
02:22:34,473 --> 02:22:38,102
Okay sleep now. don't set alarm.
he may get up for that.

1565
02:22:38,277 --> 02:22:40,074
l'll come and wake you up.

1566
02:22:42,714 --> 02:22:45,512
l think it's better
if we tell Arya and leave.

1567
02:22:46,418 --> 02:22:47,510
No need.

1568
02:23:15,547 --> 02:23:16,809
What's all this?

1569
02:23:18,750 --> 02:23:20,513
How can Ajay smoke without me?

1570
02:23:20,686 --> 02:23:22,278
He'll smoke only
when l smoke half of it.

1571
02:23:22,454 --> 02:23:25,287
l thought he may face problem
in Australia. so...

1572
02:23:25,457 --> 02:23:27,322
So all this.

1573
02:23:27,659 --> 02:23:29,820
Do you know we are going to Australia?

1574
02:23:30,762 --> 02:23:31,660
l know.

1575
02:23:32,297 --> 02:23:36,859
Without my knowledge.
you can't even take a breath.

1576
02:23:37,336 --> 02:23:38,496
May be you both are right.

1577
02:23:38,670 --> 02:23:42,333
because sadness will be
only once for anything.

1578
02:23:42,608 --> 02:23:44,667
but two sad things are
happening to me at a time.

1579
02:23:47,079 --> 02:23:50,412
You're leaving and
he too is leaving me.

1580
02:23:52,417 --> 02:23:56,751
l may do anything to stop you
unable to bear this sadness.

1581
02:23:57,422 --> 02:23:59,754
Call father-in-law. or do anything.

1582
02:24:00,092 --> 02:24:03,255
So. to keep myself doing
anything to you.

1583
02:24:05,364 --> 02:24:06,422
What's that?

1584
02:24:06,765 --> 02:24:09,359
Don't worry. just a small dose.

1585
02:24:09,735 --> 02:24:13,899
When you leave tomorrow morning.
to stop me from awakening.

1586
02:24:21,747 --> 02:24:23,271
Give this gift to Ajay.

1587
02:24:25,751 --> 02:24:28,447
Why are you staring at me?

1588
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:30,278
For not giving you any gift?

1589
02:24:31,256 --> 02:24:34,282
Auspicious thread on
your neck is my gift to you.

1590
02:24:36,328 --> 02:24:43,461
Because when l was tying the knot.
l remembered Ajay.

1591
02:24:43,769 --> 02:24:46,829
That's why l couldn't tie three knots.

1592
02:24:49,374 --> 02:24:51,808
lf tying three knots completes
our marriage.

1593
02:24:52,277 --> 02:24:54,302
then we are not married at all.

1594
02:24:59,217 --> 02:25:00,912
What will you do after we go away?

1595
02:25:06,558 --> 02:25:11,495
What will l do?
You never thought of me as your lover.

1596
02:25:12,197 --> 02:25:14,324
He too never thought
of me as a friend.

1597
02:25:15,267 --> 02:25:18,430
But father-in-law thought of me
as son-in-law instantly.

1598
02:25:18,804 --> 02:25:22,900
l betrayed him.
l'll go to him.

1599
02:25:23,475 --> 02:25:24,635
Whatever he wants to do.
l'll leave it to him.

1600
02:25:24,810 --> 02:25:27,244
My father will kill you.

1601
02:25:29,181 --> 02:25:30,341
Let him kill.

1602
02:25:30,749 --> 02:25:32,614
lf he's so angry to kill me.

1603
02:25:34,252 --> 02:25:35,913
l've so much love to die.

1604
02:25:41,827 --> 02:25:44,694
Okay. we are getting late.

1605
02:25:46,832 --> 02:25:50,700
Arya! Did l call fondly?

1606
02:26:03,648 --> 02:26:07,015
No. but you felt like calling.
That's enough!

1607
02:26:16,895 --> 02:26:18,385
Can l ask you something?

1608
02:26:19,931 --> 02:26:22,331
Were you really friendly with me?

1609
02:26:22,601 --> 02:26:24,501
Or did you act like Ajay?

1610
02:26:25,804 --> 02:26:27,567
Can l ask you something?

1611
02:26:27,839 --> 02:26:31,570
You love Ajay so much.
how could you do that accident?

1612
02:26:52,964 --> 02:26:55,762
What is this?
- Arya gave it.- Arya?

1613
02:26:55,934 --> 02:26:58,266
Does he know we are going?
- He knows.

1614
02:26:58,436 --> 02:27:00,700
l'm sure he'll inform your father.

1615
02:27:00,872 --> 02:27:02,032
Let's go immediately.
This place is no more safe.

1616
02:27:02,374 --> 02:27:03,363
No. he'll not inform.

1617
02:27:03,542 --> 02:27:05,840
Why not? He already did once.
have you forgotten it?

1618
02:27:06,011 --> 02:27:07,706
We are still here because
he told your father. Come.

1619
02:27:07,879 --> 02:27:08,868
l know he'll not tell.

1620
02:27:09,047 --> 02:27:11,607
How knows him better. you or me?
l know him from childhood.

1621
02:27:11,783 --> 02:27:13,375
You know him but
haven't understood him.

1622
02:27:13,552 --> 02:27:17,420
He loves you and me.
He's struggling between us.

1623
02:27:17,589 --> 02:27:19,284
Forget about him. first...

1624
02:27:20,959 --> 02:27:23,291
They have come. you said he'll not
but l said he will.

1625
02:27:23,461 --> 02:27:25,053
He told him.
- He will not.

1626
02:27:25,397 --> 02:27:27,058
lf not how could your father know it.

1627
02:27:27,799 --> 02:27:29,027
l told him.

1628
02:27:30,902 --> 02:27:33,564
Yes. l called him here.

1629
02:27:33,905 --> 02:27:35,736
We can be happy
if we go away now.

1630
02:27:35,907 --> 02:27:39,104
After that my father will kill Arya.

1631
02:27:39,578 --> 02:27:41,739
Why should Arya die for our love?

1632
02:27:42,447 --> 02:27:45,814
This is our problem and
we must solve it ourselves.

1633
02:27:46,585 --> 02:27:48,109
Get in first.

1634
02:27:48,553 --> 02:27:50,418
Are you mad?
Why don't you get in?

1635
02:27:50,589 --> 02:27:52,489
They don't talk. they only kill. come.

1636
02:27:52,691 --> 02:27:56,593
Let him kill. if he's so angry to kill.
l've so much love to die.

1637
02:27:56,761 --> 02:27:59,127
Do you've it?
- We must be alive for that.

1638
02:28:08,139 --> 02:28:11,939
Father. please don't harm Ajay.

1639
02:28:12,611 --> 02:28:16,138
l called you here because Ajay...

1640
02:28:18,350 --> 02:28:19,009
Father...

1641
02:28:20,619 --> 02:28:21,347
Father...

1642
02:28:22,354 --> 02:28:23,150
Father!

1643
02:28:30,962 --> 02:28:34,022
Please father. leave Ajay.

1644
02:28:37,769 --> 02:28:38,861
Father!

1645
02:28:39,604 --> 02:28:42,698
Please father!
No father!

1646
02:29:12,137 --> 02:29:16,130
Raji Reddy! He's my friend.
he's my life.

1647
02:29:16,474 --> 02:29:19,671
lf you harm him.
l'll kill everyone here.

1648
02:29:22,647 --> 02:29:23,875
Will you kill me?

1649
02:29:24,049 --> 02:29:26,847
Kill me...kill me...
why don't you understand him?

1650
02:29:27,018 --> 02:29:28,417
Because he's not a man but an idiot.

1651
02:29:28,586 --> 02:29:29,883
He is...
- Wrong.

1652
02:29:30,055 --> 02:29:31,488
Why are you abusing him?
Who do you think he is?

1653
02:29:31,656 --> 02:29:33,590
Father-in-law...God!
What did he do wrong?

1654
02:29:33,758 --> 02:29:35,692
Any father would do like
this for his daughter.

1655
02:29:35,860 --> 02:29:38,590
Father-in-law. l'm sorry.
Ajay is very good man.

1656
02:29:38,763 --> 02:29:41,493
But he can't talk properly.
Say sorry to him.

1657
02:29:41,666 --> 02:29:43,031
Please listen to me once.

1658
02:29:44,069 --> 02:29:46,867
For begetting such a sinful daughter.

1659
02:29:47,038 --> 02:29:47,629
Father-in-law!

1660
02:29:47,806 --> 02:29:49,740
Geetha is my wife. you don't
have any right to beat her.

1661
02:29:49,908 --> 02:29:51,569
She's not to be faulted.
it's all my fault.

1662
02:29:51,743 --> 02:29:52,801
l'm responsible for everything.

1663
02:29:52,978 --> 02:29:56,641
Yes. you're responsible for everything.

1664
02:29:56,815 --> 02:30:00,615
My mistake was trusting and giving
my daughter in marriage to you.

1665
02:30:02,988 --> 02:30:05,047
You betrayed my trust.

1666
02:30:05,457 --> 02:30:07,948
Please sir. don't beat him.
he's our son-in-law.

1667
02:30:08,126 --> 02:30:09,457
He may die. sir.
Please listen to me.

1668
02:30:09,627 --> 02:30:13,723
Beat me...beat me...
kill me. father-in-law.

1669
02:30:13,898 --> 02:30:14,990
Atleast the Geetha and
Ajay will live happily.

1670
02:30:15,166 --> 02:30:16,463
Kill me. father-in-law!

1671
02:30:16,634 --> 02:30:17,726
Father!

1672
02:30:18,269 --> 02:30:21,830
l called you here thinking
you'll understand me.

1673
02:30:22,007 --> 02:30:26,501
Not to kill him.
Nobody must hurt anyone here.

1674
02:30:26,678 --> 02:30:28,270
lf anyone hurts anybody...

1675
02:30:33,651 --> 02:30:37,951
Are you mad?
What's this?

1676
02:30:38,123 --> 02:30:43,060
What's this madam? Boss agreed
for that marriage for you.

1677
02:30:43,228 --> 02:30:45,162
He ate dog's leftover
food also for you.

1678
02:30:45,497 --> 02:30:48,694
Everything is over.
there's only one way out.

1679
02:30:48,867 --> 02:30:54,271
lf you harm Ajay. Geetha will die.

1680
02:30:54,606 --> 02:30:58,167
No. he must die if Geetha
wants to live happily.

1681
02:30:58,576 --> 02:31:03,013
Father-in-law. tell him. if he
harms Ajay. l'll kill Geetha.

1682
02:31:03,181 --> 02:31:06,241
Kill her...kill her...

1683
02:31:07,519 --> 02:31:11,649
You can't kill her because you love her.

1684
02:31:11,823 --> 02:31:15,122
Yes l love Geetha. father-in-law.

1685
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:17,191
l can't kill Geetha.

1686
02:31:17,529 --> 02:31:19,895
But l can kill myself. father-in-law.
l'll kill myself.

1687
02:31:20,065 --> 02:31:23,694
Stop...stop...
Leave him.

1688
02:31:24,169 --> 02:31:26,967
He may kill himself really.
he's mad man.

1689
02:31:28,139 --> 02:31:30,039
He'll do anything for anyone.

1690
02:31:30,208 --> 02:31:32,540
He wants everyone and
wants everyone to be fine.

1691
02:31:32,710 --> 02:31:34,541
Leave him.

1692
02:31:38,149 --> 02:31:40,208
Arya. stay like that. don't remove
the knife. we'll go away.

1693
02:31:40,552 --> 02:31:42,019
Stay like that till we go away.

1694
02:31:42,187 --> 02:31:43,654
Come Geetha. let's go.
we are getting late to our flight.

1695
02:31:43,822 --> 02:31:46,552
We can't manage them.
he'll take care of them. let's go.

1696
02:31:48,259 --> 02:31:50,227
Come l say...come...
come...come...

1697
02:31:50,562 --> 02:31:52,621
Why are you looking at me?
Come fast...come...

1698
02:31:52,797 --> 02:31:54,321
Look at him! Your friend!

1699
02:31:54,666 --> 02:31:59,626
Were you doing all this for him?
For him?

1700
02:31:59,804 --> 02:32:03,001
No father-in-law. Geetha loves Ajay.
so let her go with him.

1701
02:32:03,174 --> 02:32:04,232
Please father-in-law.

1702
02:32:04,943 --> 02:32:06,740
He's not right man.

1703
02:32:06,911 --> 02:32:09,106
He wasn't right when he sent
you to stop the marriage.

1704
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:14,308
he isn't right now when he wants to
escape putting your life in danger.

1705
02:32:14,652 --> 02:32:16,882
he can never be right.
- What not right?

1706
02:32:17,055 --> 02:32:18,283
When he's accepting.
what's your problem?

1707
02:32:18,623 --> 02:32:20,090
ls it worrying you that
she's already married?

1708
02:32:20,258 --> 02:32:22,749
ls it marriage if you force
it against her wish?

1709
02:32:23,194 --> 02:32:25,094
Can l marry her if l snap it?

1710
02:32:25,263 --> 02:32:28,755
This is root cause of all problems.
Remove it. Geetha.

1711
02:33:18,650 --> 02:33:20,140
Now you called me with love.

1712
02:34:00,778 --> 02:34:02,075
Just a minute!

1713
02:34:09,087 --> 02:34:12,420
What l'd wished never to happen.
it did happen.

1714
02:34:13,024 --> 02:34:15,390
First time l'm seeing love
in Geetha's eyes.

1715
02:34:17,195 --> 02:34:19,163
How much she's yearning for him!

1716
02:34:20,465 --> 02:34:22,797
l never this when she was with me.

1717
02:34:24,302 --> 02:34:27,601
Right. you don't need years
to sprout love.

1718
02:34:28,039 --> 02:34:29,506
Just a moment is enough.

1719
02:34:40,084 --> 02:34:41,745
Arya's relative?

1720
02:35:12,717 --> 02:35:15,845
Haven't you yet gone to Australia?

1721
02:35:18,189 --> 02:35:22,489
How can we go?
No. Geetha will not come.

1722
02:35:23,194 --> 02:35:26,220
Everything is over.
she's crying for you out there. Look!

1723
02:35:28,700 --> 02:35:30,497
What are you planning to do?

1724
02:35:30,668 --> 02:35:32,727
What option do l've now?
Sacrifice!

1725
02:35:33,071 --> 02:35:34,561
lf l don't do it now.
l'll become a villain.

1726
02:35:34,739 --> 02:35:36,764
This time your father-in-law will
not miss. he'll stab correctly.

1727
02:35:37,108 --> 02:35:39,770
Not that...
- You're not able to understand.

1728
02:35:40,111 --> 02:35:42,875
Geetha has changed...changed.

1729
02:35:44,082 --> 02:35:45,811
You not only changed Geetha.

1730
02:35:47,552 --> 02:35:48,883
you've changed me too.

1731
02:35:49,754 --> 02:35:52,882
l know you love me.

1732
02:35:53,291 --> 02:35:56,419
But didn't know you
can give life too for it.

1733
02:35:58,263 --> 02:35:59,696
Will you die for me?

1734
02:36:02,467 --> 02:36:07,370
First time...l feel you're my friend.

1735
02:36:24,722 --> 02:36:28,886
But l know love isn't greater
than our friendship.

1736
02:36:29,661 --> 02:36:32,858
Because Geetha loved me
getting angry on you.

1737
02:36:33,364 --> 02:36:35,730
Now Geetha is not angry on you.

1738
02:36:36,167 --> 02:36:37,794
lt means she doesn't love
me anymore.

1739
02:36:38,436 --> 02:36:41,633
Now Geetha is yours.
but she's not coming out.

1740
02:36:42,740 --> 02:36:46,403
lf it has to happen.
Geetha must get angry on me.

1741
02:36:47,412 --> 02:36:49,312
That's why l'm thinking
of telling the truth.

1742
02:36:49,480 --> 02:36:50,469
What truth?

1743
02:36:50,648 --> 02:36:54,675
About that accident. l'll tell her
it was me not you who did it.

1744
02:36:54,852 --> 02:36:58,219
No. you promised to keep it a secret.

1745
02:36:59,691 --> 02:37:01,488
What do you want me to do now?

1746
02:37:03,628 --> 02:37:05,960
Write in the diary what l say.

1747
02:37:12,637 --> 02:37:14,696
Must say sorry to Ajay.

1748
02:37:17,642 --> 02:37:19,667
To me? Why?

1749
02:37:22,413 --> 02:37:23,937
What happened?

1750
02:37:25,216 --> 02:37:26,615
Want me switch it on?

1751
02:37:27,885 --> 02:37:29,853
Which switch?
Switch off this?

1752
02:37:52,910 --> 02:37:54,502
Who switched off this button?

1753
02:37:54,679 --> 02:37:56,010
l mean...

1754
02:37:56,881 --> 02:37:58,644
Were you planning to kill him?

1755
02:38:24,909 --> 02:38:25,967
Sorry buddy!
