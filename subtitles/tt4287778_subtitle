1
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,282
C'mon... C'mon...

2
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,084
Delhi... Delhi... Delhi...

3
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,323
Come aboard for Delhi.

4
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,755
Come... come...

5
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:32,791
C'mon... C'mon...

6
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,669
Come aboard for Delhi.

7
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,146
All the time weddings, weddings...

8
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,380
I hate weddings.

9
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,020
I'll never get married.

10
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,251
Do you like my mehandi?

11
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,488
Do you want the same design?

12
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,188
Cut the crap, Raina.

13
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,497
Anu!

14
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,533
Is this how you
talk to your sister ?

15
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,258
I'm not a little kid anymore!

16
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,528
If you are so busy then...

17
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,097
why get me home!

18
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,676
I would really like to know,
once you become famous...

19
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,311
and a big star...

20
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,548
what would you do for your state?

21
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,090
As in the women of Punjab.

22
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,224
What change would
you like bring about?

23
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,663
Ma'am basically women anywhere,

24
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,665
not particularly Punjab...

25
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,059
I would say are suffering.

26
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,769
So, if I win and I become famous

27
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,301
I will obviously...

28
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,672
get people from
Punjab, these women...

29
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,006
coming with... along with me

30
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,406
and travelling the world

31
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,449
and then spreading the
message across the world

32
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,381
what the problem is
going on in the country...

33
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,516
and probably taking
help from other people...

34
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,417
around the world

35
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,352
Not impressed.

36
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,112
I love your tattoo.

37
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,055
Thank you.

38
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:47,716
What does it mean ?

39
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,421
It says Capricorn.
That's my horoscope.

40
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,223
I was born in 23rd December.

41
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,330
Himanshu, why do you
want to become a model ?

42
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,601
Well Sir,

43
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,535
I can become a Nobel
Prize winner later.

44
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,571

74
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,121
So, you mean to say...

75
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,031
the contestants who aren't fair
aren't good enough?

76
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,368
Ma'am... uhh...

77
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,265
I need...

78
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,963
I don't need Fair and beauty cream.

I don't have property.

83
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,312
You can speak in Hindi.

84
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,418
I'm asking,

85
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,176
What's your...

86
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,420
attractive quality?

87
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,749
What's so...

88
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:27,616
What's the word?

89
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,651
Special about you?

00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,059
My smile.

91
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,288
My best quality is my smile.

92
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,597
C'mon Mohan...

93
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,226

Okay, that's enough.

99
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,395
Mohan...
tell me...

100
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,428
why do you want to become a model?

101
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:10,693
Because... Uhh...

102
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,001
I look Italian?

103
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,362
Have you ever been to Italy?

104
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,335
What is the capital of Italy?

105
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:18,972
Paris.

106
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:19,604
OkayÂ»-

107
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,234
Uhh..

108
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:21,741
I think that's enough...

109
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,206

146
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,736

00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,496
Can I help you with something?

196
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,061
No...
Thanks.

197
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,632
Are you ok?

198
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,736
I came here for a job...

199
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,472
but I didn't get it...

200
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,207
now, all my money-

201
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,680
Hold on!

202
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,707
This is a restaurant
not an NGO.

203
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,519
Either you order something...

204
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,645
Save the stories for someone else.

205
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,382
God knows where they come from!

206
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:48,716
Do you remember...

207
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,387
You had also once walked
in here just like this?

208
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,193
You'll never change...

209
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,359
so go feed him something...

210
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,228
Bye!

211
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,204
Bye .

212
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,504
Alright mate!

213
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,301
I'll see you there.

214
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,741
Ya. Okay bye.

215
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:09,440
Ni

216
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,480
Do you need anything from Sydney?

217
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,308
No darling!

218
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,678
Have fun.

219
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,745
You look quite beautiful today...

220
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,284
bye...

221
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,993
See you!

222
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,767
Hello!

223
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,033
Yes, it is me.

224
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,337
Are you fine?

225
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,540
Give me twenty seconds...

226
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,685
I have to tell you
something. Please!

227
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,119
Hello!

228
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,416
Hello!

229
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,117
Damn!

230
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,466
Getting bored?

231
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,661
No... Sir, I'll be leaving.

232
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,664
Relax!

233
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,434
There's still some time
before your bus leaves.

234
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,239
Want anything else?

235
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,332
No, no... Sir

236
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,309
Dhanaulti?

237
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,549
Yes ma'am

238
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,781
Sonal.

239
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,546
Yes Ma'am...

240
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,216
sorry

241
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,551
Sonal.

242
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,089
Why did you call?

243
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,555
What's it?

244
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,133
Ma'am

245
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,494
Ma'am, please get
me any job ma'am.

246
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,044
Go and freshen up,

247
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,120
hmm...

248
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:33,713
Go go go...

249
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,224
There!

250
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,620
What do you want from life?

251
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,225
To have a house like this.

252
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,189
You like this house?

253
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,659
Yes...

254
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,265
but there would be tubelights...

255
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,533
Not so dark.

256
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,539
Why?

257
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,304
You don't like this?

258
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,603
No...

259
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,447
lt's feels lonesome.

260
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,284
Come here...

261
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,745
come.

262
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,160
Now...?

263
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,021
Does it feel lonesome?

264
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,393
No Ma'am.

265
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,068
<i>' Sana? .</i>

266
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,629
Do you find me beautiful?

267
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,405
Mam..

268
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,507
Sonal, uh...

269
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,115
To your tubelight bright future

270
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,536
Do you wanna touch me?

271
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,243
Ma'am...

272
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,301
Uh...

273
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,503
Take it easy...

274
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,403
Doesn't he love you?

275
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,222
I love you.

276
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,001
This is for you...

277
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,565
Keep it.

278
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,475
To help settle in Delhi...

279
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,035
and from today...

280
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,480
You're my trainer.

281
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,510
And yes...

282
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,145
I really don't like
the name 'Mohan'.

283
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,353
âAzfarâ

284
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,325
The gifted one...

285
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,329
The one who will never need to

286
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,422
struggle for success.

287
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,327
Hmm.

288
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:04,590
Hi!

289
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,718
My name must be on the list.

290
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,724
IFS Neil.

291
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,059
Sir, bike!

292
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,766
I am a traveller

293
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,342
at the crossroads?

294
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,213
In sight

295
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,440
no destination

296
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,109
like a bird

297
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,388
wandering

298
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,353
in search of the

299
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,017
elusive nest

300
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:40,486
where time would be still

301
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,469
and there would be little peace

302
00:23:56,334 --> 00:24:00,976
why this loneliness?

303
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:05,619
The wails of an empty heart

304
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:10,426
why this separation

305
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:15,423
has penetrated the soul?

306
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,457
I am the eyes

307
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,065
I am the word

308
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,202
lam in dreams

309
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,564
and desires

310
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,399
I am the cause

311
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,643
I am the effect

312
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,040
I am the one

313
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,647
in my ambitions

314
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,511
I illuminate myself

315
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,086
lam my well wisher

316
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,179
lam my guide

317
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:17,159
I trust only in myself

318
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:25,257
Alas! This distance
from the loved ones...

319
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:32,202
why this loneliness?

320
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:37,004
The wails of an empty heart

321
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:41,609
why this separation

322
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,785
has penetrated the soul?

323
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:35,637
Hi! Good morning.

324
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,432
Hello!

325
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,338
Ready to place your order?

326
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,372
You don't remember?

327
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,239
Huh?...

328
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,409
About a month back...

329
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,374
Hauz Khas village...

330
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,281
<i>Water...</i>

331
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,313
Oh..

332
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:48,748
Moh...

333
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,041
Azfar...

334
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:50,709
Oh.. Okay

335
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,586
I had left without paying.

336
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,056
Forget it...

337
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,217
That's okay...

338
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,193
Weren't you leaving Delhi?

339
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,089
How could I leave Delhi?

340
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,466
I am getting launched here

341
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,434
as a model.

342
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:08,636
Great!

343
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,002
When did you shift here?

344
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:16,975
Umm...

345
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:17,706
last month.

346
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,710
Why?

347
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,207
That owner was pestering us...

348
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,318
Asshole...

349
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,752
Don't you think he
is a little too young?

350
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,186
Shut up dude!

351
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,693
Have some shame!

352
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,527
It is the same boy...

353
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,728
<i>who you were shoo-'mg away...</i>

354
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,160
the morning after Nishant..

355
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,568
Neil...

356
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:42,570
stop it!

357
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,433
I am fine.

358
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,377
Take this...

359
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,638
Serve his order.

360
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:51,776
Sure!

361
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,363
Enjoy your meal, Sir.

362
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,155
How is it?

363
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,690
Beautiful...

364
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,634
I am impressed.

365
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,669
So I finally managed
to impress you?

366
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,146
As if that matters?

367
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:04,951
Why not?

368
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,158
Hello! Hello!

369
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,560
Oh! Hi...

370
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:17,659
How are you?

371
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,065
How are you?

372
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,296
Good! good!

373
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:21,226
So...

374
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:22,967

375
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,097
handsome young man?

You are such a good swimmer...

380
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,673
I can't even float.

381
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,514
It would be my
pleasure, to teach you.

382
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:36,381
Anytime.

383
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,585
Promise?

384

Not bad, Azzi...

385
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,158

Bye!

When will you

391
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,157
Shit! 8:15.

392
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,792
Get dressed quickly.
We have to leave.

393
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,157
Vivek hates it when I'm late.

394
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,359
Sonal?

395
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,663
Call me 'Ma'am' in public.

396
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:44,616
GK?

397
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:45,712
GK M-Block market?

398
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,063
Hey, hey wait...

399
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,726
we have another piece inside.

400
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:02,696
Thank you.

401
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,676
So this is your first
Hindi movie. Right?

402
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:18,520
Don't worry.

403
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:19,782
I will translate it for you.

404
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,689
He looks like such a
wanna-be in that shirt.

405
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,791
Isn't this shirt too flashy?

406
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,592
What do you think?

407
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,099
It's terrible.

408
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:43,703
Should we leave?

409
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:44,644
Yeah.

410
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:45,737
Bye .

411
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,047
Cars are flying...

412
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,114
people are dying...

413
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,421
and nothing happens to the hero?

414
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,354
I don't get it.

415
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,629
Afia!

416
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,062
Afia!

417
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,427
Can we talk alone, for a minute?

418
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,202
Why?

419
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,335
Afia! I called off my wedding.

420
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,102
Who are you?

421
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,109
And who is this Afia?

422
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,143
What are you saying?

423
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:48,574
Relax..

424
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,543
Are you insane?

425
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,444
Should I call the police?

426
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,707
Let's go.

427
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,999
Don't be spoil sports!

428
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,041
The night is young...

429
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,337
I won't go home...

430
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,377
Such beautiful rain!

431
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,277
I am getting married...
after that...

432
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,509
I will be imprisoned at home...

433
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,077

434
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,153

445
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,001
Does it look alright?

446
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,298
Looking stunning...

447
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,213
lsn't it a bit expensive?

448
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,709
Are you really buying this for me?

449
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,209
Let's go to Amsterdam
and get married.

450
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,457
Neil...

451
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,161
If I were like that, I
would've said yes long ago.

452
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,130
What do you mean by âwereâ?

453
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,762
lam the only son...

454
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,039
my dad would definitely die.

455
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,653
We can visit Amsterdam anyway.

456
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:15,486
Neil...

457
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,717
Let's go

458
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,155

459
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:20,458

460
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,407
Nishant is getting married.

461
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,206
Poor girl!

462
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:45,119
Until then he wants
to stay with me.

463
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,483
NO!

464
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,226
Maybe if l agree...

465
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,689
he will change his mind.

466
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,398
NO!

467
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,412

00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,212
How are you?

469
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:15,717
Good.

470
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,411
Here...

471
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,316
For laundry?

472
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,287
It's for you...

473
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,125
If I wear this, People
will laugh at me.

474
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,595
Please keep it with you.

475
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,508
Enjoy your food!

476
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,388
Stop gawking at me...

477
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,318

478
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,227
Sugar?

479
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,726
Why don't you take a sip...

480
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,126
It would become sweet.

481
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,039
Hey, listen...

482
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,106

483
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:13,471
What happened to Neil?

484
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:14,976
His boyfriend is getting married...

485
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:15,634
next month.

486
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,573
BOYFRIEND.

487
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,279
What's so funny?

488
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,053
I mean, he does not look like that.

489
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,091
What do you mean?

490
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:31,558
I mean...

491
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,356
one could never make out.

492
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,262
We are not so shameless.
Keep it yourself.

493
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,308
Hold on, hold on, Signal...

494
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,518
Nice photo of you in HT City today!

00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:15,460
Don't you have to go
out with Mr.Modi tonight?

496
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,595
Sonal, I was joking...

497
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,082
Meet Azfar,

508
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:02,769
Oh!

509
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,205

510
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:07,104
Good job Sonal...

511

Would love to work with you sir.

515
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,184
On which ramp would
you make him walk...

516
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,057

522
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:27,399
Ah!

523
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,334

524
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,039
Orange Juice for him please.

525
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,196
Don't be a bitch darling.

526
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:33,564
He will have the same as me.

527
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:57,488
You have to try

528
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:58,499

00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,159

Enjoy your drink.

532
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,334
Cheers!

533
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:09,608
Thank you, love...

534
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,078
Are you still single?

535
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,340
Very much, sir.

536
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,644
Sonal look at him...

537
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,718
he has rejected me
for the last six weeks.

538
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,278
Eight weeks sir.

539
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,255
You deserve it Rohan...

540
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,650
when will you present
your new collection?

541
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,623
There are too many shows in Delhi.

542
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,557
True...

543
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,188
Every tailor claims
to be a designer...

544
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,326
I would love to see
one of your shows.

545
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,630
You should be on
the ramp, sweetheart.

546
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,232
He is not ready, Rohan.

547
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,266
Come over to my studio anytime.

548
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,476
I'm drinking too much today...

549
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,771
and it's all because of you...

550
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,606
I will get booked.

551
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,148
Ah...

552
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,147
He will drive you back.

553
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,614
But what about you?

554
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,458
Don't worry...

555
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,603
Keep the meter running.

556
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,169
I'll pay for your time.

557
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,414
I'll have a Nero D'Avola...

558
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,614
and do you still have Bruschetta?

559
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:27,779
Yes sir.

560
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,023
Afia?

561
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:32,723
Nothing.

562
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:33,458
Thanks.

563
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,430
Bye Sonal.

564
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:41,799
Let's go

565
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,079
So what's the flavor of the night?

566
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,057
Sorry?

567
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,584
Forget it...

568
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:05,584
Darling...

569
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,259
I am in a mood to party more.

570
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,430
But I didn't even know-

571
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,231
Don't lie!

572
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,403
You've trapped my son...

573
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,606
Leave my hand!

574
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,043
Sir...

575
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,607
I must ask you to leave.

576
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,674
Just mind your own business.

577
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:28,482
Sir...

578
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,550
I insist.

579
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:30,708
I'll call your owner...

580
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:32,043
this not Europe...

581
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,620
In India we know how to
treat superiors with respect.

582
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,457
Do whatever you please sir...

583
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,316
but outside this restaurant.

584
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,498
I'm telling you
for the last time...

585
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,297
leave him.

586
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,302
Drink?

587
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,540
It's pretty late...

588
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:04,385
You're not afraid, are you?

589
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,484
Why would I be afraid?

590
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,752
I'm just very tired.

591
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,289
Come for a while.

592
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,131
My maid comes early...

593
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:22,164
I'll drop you to 1 OAK.

594
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,507
Don't you dare leave me again.

595
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:36,118
Good night sir.

596
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:49,260
What is it?

597
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,331
I'm busy.

598
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,135
You really want to walk the ramp?

599
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,464
You doing it right.

600
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,270
He will fullfill all your dreams.

601
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:12,351
Dont't tell me what
I can and can't do!

602
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,252
I need a drink.

603
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:46,382
Drink...

604
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,493
Hey you!

605
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,965
Go and create ruckus
somewhere else...

606
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:07,462
not at my home

607
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:51,440
Anu...

608
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:09,221
Come in...

609
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:22,361
19-year-old student
commits suicide...

610
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:26,568
After alleged breakup
with his teacher.

611
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:30,538
Good night sir!

612
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:31,338
See you...

613
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,640
See you tomorrow.

614
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:22,620
Nishant don't do this to me again.

615
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,331
Thank you, Bhaiyya.

616
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,237
Let me know when next

617
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:07,536
Happy Diwali

618
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,100
Happy Diwali to you too.

619
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,107
Dear Afia...

620
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:43,810
Need to sort out some problems.

621
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:47,281
I quit my job and have to leave...

622
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,448
Please take good care of Raina...

623
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:50,814
my best friend in Delhi.

624
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:52,276
Benoit

625
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,704
May I have a glass of water?

626
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,565
Hmm...

627
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,040
Where's the money?

628
00:52:57,607 --> 00:52:58,745
How are you darling?

629
00:52:59,042 --> 00:52:59,747
Very well sweetie!

630
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:00,584
How are you?

631
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:02,523
Fabulous!

632
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,759
I thought you wanted to work?

633
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,256
I only asked him...

634
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,488
not to bother you.

635
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,756
That night you went
without informing...

636
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,360
Very rude Azzii...

637
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,503
Call me if you are still serious.

638
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,667
Since when have you
started designing...

639
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:21,402
clothes for the working class?

640
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,007
<i>V â(as .</i>

641
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:26,045
Meet Sonal.

642
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:26,780
Azfa r.

643
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:27,377
Hi!

644
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:27,676
Hi!

645
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,182
Nice to meet you.

646
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,184
Model?

647
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,011
I own a real estate company.

648
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:33,712
WOW!

649
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,552
Anything big coming up?

650
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,424
Shall we discuss this
on the dance floor?

651
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:39,652
Of course!

652
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:40,753
Good idea!

653
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:41,593
Lets go.

654
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:42,595
BYE boys!

655
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,098
At the contest...

656
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:56,042
Sonal had voted negative for you

657
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:48,493
Hi!

658
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:49,594
Hi!

659
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,195
Uuhhh...

660
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:51,662
Neil?

661
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:56,068
He was robbed and he is hurt.

662
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,735
Did he Inform the police?

663
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,069
It was his fault...

664
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,973
listen, I have to be home early...

665
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,067
Anu is waiting.

666
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,206
Diwali holidays...

667
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,346
I'll drop you.

668
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,552
Don't bother,
I'll take an auto.

669
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,214
If you behave so uptight...

670
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,224
the Auto driver will
charge you double.

671
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,654
I am offerning you free ride.

672
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,392
Shall we?

673
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,360
I don't know
what's wrong with him

674
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,094
Maybe he is just very alone...

675
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:32,571
Right?

676
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,475
He is not the onlyone alone.

677
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:41,247
Why?

678
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:42,709
You too?

679
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:50,283
Heyâ

680
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,621
Stop, stop, stop...

681
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,167
You never left Delhi?

682
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,701
You know...

683
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,533
that man called my boss and...

684
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,410
the next day I was fired.

685
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:14,743
Oh!!

686
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:18,114
So you also tell lies.

687
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,246
I never wrote I was in Paris...

688
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:25,983
Who's he?

689
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,319
Oh...

690
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,685
He's Azfar...

691
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:29,720
Benoit.

692
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:30,629
Yeah...

693
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:33,366
Nice to meet you.

694
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:34,330
You know what?

695
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,695
You look familiar.

696
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:39,399
No.

697
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,442
Listen...

698
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,478
there's an opening
at Neil's Cafe.

699
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:45,137
Yeah...

700
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:45,611
But I can't..

701
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:46,408
I don't really know him...

702
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:47,447
Just go there...

703
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,313
say I sent you.

704
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,747
I'll think about it.

705
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:55,316
OkayÂ»-

706
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:56,186
I have to leave.

707
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,190
Anu is home alone.

708
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,624
Give her my love.

709
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:13,733
Anu!

710
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,614
Sorry dear, I'm late

711
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,708
Are you all right?

712
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,346
Azfar...

713
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:25,485
My sister Anu.

714
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,283
Happy Diwali, baby.

715
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,282
Anupama...
not baby.

716
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,582
I am sorry...
Anupama...

717
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,684
you are even prettier
than your sister

718
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,155
You can call me Anu.

719
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:38,724
Thank you Anu...

720
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,366
Bye, now.

721
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:41,568
Happy Diwali

722
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:42,329
Bye .

723
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,205
Would you and your
sister come out...

724
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,140
with me for dinner tomorrow night?

725
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,140
Tomorrow I'm going
back to school...

726
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,236
In Mussoorie.

727
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:45,396
Mom

728
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,258
Happy Diwali

729
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:22,156
I don't understand why I
can't streak my hair sis?

730
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,162
You are not old enough
for fashion statements.

731
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,135
Hi!

732
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:33,166
Hi!

733
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,333
You? - Lunch!

734
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,407
Anu told you that we
are going to Mussoorie

735
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,112
Yes
- in Mussoorie.

736
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,573
I've already booked a cab.

737
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,043
Cancel it...

738
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,409
Are you mad?

739
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:44,684
Anu, you decide.

740
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:48,685
His car does look more comfy sis.

741
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,786
Please, please, please, please...

742
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:54,684
Yes.

743
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:56,758
Do you enjoy driving?

744
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:57,825
Yeah...

745
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,531
But I love automatic cars.

746
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:04,296
Then why did you buy the manual?

747
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,301
Because... uhh...

748
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,286
lt's OK, I'll do it

749
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,255
No no, it's OK.

750
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,287
Anu, I'll do it...

751
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:26,650
Azfar it's fine...

752
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,356
Sister! Please tell him to stop it!

753
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:30,586
He's only helping.

754
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,255
What's the problem?

755
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:34,028
Look at his jeans!

756
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:37,429
What about the jeans?

757
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:38,602
They're torn.

758
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,502
It's in fashion.

759
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:41,507
I'll expain it to your teacher.

760
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,642
Fashion?

761
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,372
Maybe 5 years ago.

762
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:47,607
Okay, let's go.

763
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,354
And Raina told you
I have a job for you?

764
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:57,556
Yep...

765
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:02,521
and a room?

766
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,664
You're not excited...

767
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,464
I can see it in your eyes.

768
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,140
I'm not good at self PR.

769
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,539
Then maybe you're
better at making espresso?

770
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,041
<i>Thanks for the memos...</i>

771
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:25,447
they were delicious.

772
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,418
When we were in college...

773
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,351
we used to come here often.

774
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,557
Do you see that?

775
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,593
The brightest one...

776
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:37,731
That's Orion...

777
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,247
Coffee?

778
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:09,120
You and Neil are very close, right?

779
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,676
And what about you?

780
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,444
Do you have a girlfriend?

781
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,410
Or are you just a drifter?

782
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,040
Girlfriends!

783
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,515
Countless!

784
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,330
Is that one of them?

785
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:23,070
Like the first rain

786
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:29,004
she drenched my heart

787
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:35,245
Like the first call for prayer

788
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:41,484
She awakens me

789
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,557
Carefree one

790
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,689
Carefree one

791
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:54,124
she is a free spirit

792
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:59,136
Carefree one

793
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,205
Carefree one

794
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:06,470
She is a free spirit

795
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,646
All the fragrance of nature

796
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,648
She brings along

797
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:20,651
As if she were fragrant breeze

798
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:24,128
Carefree one

799
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,164
Carefree one

800
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:31,428
She is a free spirit

801
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,440
Carefree one

802
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,610
Carefree one

803
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:44,041
She is a free spirit

804
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:55,527
That's it.

805
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,329
It's nice.

806
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,012
Where is he?

807
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:20,351
How is it going?

808
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,383
All good!

809
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:37,160
So, what is the occasion?

810
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:42,275
Neil has stopped
mourning for Nishant!

811
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,112
Neil! Get yourself together

812
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:50,114
find a nice girl
to settle down with-

813
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,728
I mean find anything...

814
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,257
Meaning... anybody...

815
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:10,000
Meaning someone who
would take care of you.

816
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,205
Right?

817
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,105
Were you born stupid...

818
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:18,973
or did you need special training?

819
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,077
Raina it's OK.

820
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:26,118
He will not eat anything I cooked.

821
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,055
As if he cares...

822
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:35,494
girl's must be
dying to cook for him

823
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,327
I doubt it.

824
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,236
Isn't it strange...

825
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,264
a handsome young guy...

826
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:49,370
well-built

827
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:51,011
earns well

828
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:54,746
And you can't tell by
looking at him if he is...

829
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,382
lt's nothing like that.

830
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,646
Then what's it?

831
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,285
So what is your problem?

832
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:08,260
She is...

833
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,498
Sorry, I have to go

834
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,722
Anu has started asking
a lot of questions.

835
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,562
You'll have to tell
her sooner or later.

836
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,164
Hmm... I know...

837
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,097
I feel scared.

838
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:32,241
Okay

839
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:34,712
tell me truthfully...

840
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,076
What do you think of Azfar?

841
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,480
Good evening Sir...

842
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:10,208
Sir, Ma'am has called for you.

843
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,120
Actually...

844
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:23,792
That day I...

845
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,760
Who are you without me?

846
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:33,238
Who are you?

847
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,437
Who do you think you are?

848
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,075
Hmm?

849
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:55,594
Hello Sir.

850
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,729
What would you like to order?

851
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:57,826
Hello! How are you?

852
01:10:58,187 --> 01:10:59,097
I'm good.

853
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:01,659
Could we get two...
blueberry cheescakes...

854
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:02,592
and...

855
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:04,068
two black coffees please.

856
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:05,369
Okay.

857
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:07,565
Thank you.

858
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:08,434
Thank you.

859
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,229
10 O'clock.

860
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:35,797
Yes.

861
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:38,130
I'll see you there.

862
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:11,536
Hello!

863
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,137
Rohan Sir. Azfar.

864
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,450
Merry Christmas!

865
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:31,785
Merry Christmas...
Mr. Last Minute...

866
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,024
Finally you called!

867
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,324
My friend Wendell
Rodricks is here...

868
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:40,294
to shoot for his new collection.

869
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:42,025
I have recommended you...

870
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,070
My friend Ritu...

871
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,730
is going to Canada
with her father...

872
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:47,739
Sis, why can't you-

873
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:52,808
Anu, please eat quickly...

874
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:54,308
Benoit will be coming...

875
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:57,412
I am coming with you.

876
01:12:58,173 --> 01:12:59,345
Please don't fuss.

877
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:00,978
I'm not eating!

878
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,219
Okay.

879
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:03,989
Don't eat.

880
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,334
Hey Anu!

881
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:29,410
Do you have to go tonight?

882
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,413
You too want to blame me?

883
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:49,720
Can I ask you a personal question?

884
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:03,560
Your boyfriend.

885
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:05,733
You still love him?

886
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,473
I did.

887
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,115
So...

888
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:22,444
where is he?

889
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,201
You are an attractive man...

890
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:41,998
Mr. Neil
from Neil's famous coffee shop.

891
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:07,991
Hi love...

892
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,043
What happened?

893
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:22,173
Sorry dude...

894
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:23,682
I was at a family
fucntion in Chandigarh.

895
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,514
Was not able to get out of it.

896
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:28,682
So, please go back there.

897
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,214
Sorry?

898
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,194
Who is this?

899
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:29,078
Rohan!

900
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,480
What happened?

901
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:39,115
So, you finally managed
to get rid of Nishant?

902
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:40,558
Of course...

903
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:45,295
I have something to show.

904
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:07,418
I thought you were
always bluffing...

905
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,281
but you turned out
to be a real model.

906
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,465
I'll get a candle.

907
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:46,055
You are being mischevious.

908
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:40,740
Raina...

909
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,334
How do I tell you ?

910
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:10,108
That I am incomplete

911
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,275
How to make you believe?

912
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:20,013
That we are meant to be

913
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:26,281
Now, this is my only desire

914
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:30,356
To live in this moment

915
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:38,230
You are standing right there

916
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:42,403
Yet so far

917
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:46,172
Nothing remains

918
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,478
Between us

919
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:53,111
But why does the heart still say

920
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,248
Oh beloved

921
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:03,289
Just do this for me

922
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:08,059
For one last time

923
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:13,336
Take me in your arms

924
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:17,200
Oh beloved

925
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:24,045
Just do this for me

926
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:29,147
For one last time

927
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:34,424
Take me in your arms

928
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:08,385
He committed Suicide.

929
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:10,757
Who's this?

930
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:16,262
He was my student.

931
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,043
Yes!

932
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:29,578
Instead of falling in love...

933
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:31,717
I should have protected him.

934
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:47,665
Hello Sir.

935
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:48,723
Sonal madam has
sent this for you...

936
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:50,064
Please be there in half an hour.

937
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:50,432
Okay.

938
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,669

939
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,180
I've paid double the
amount to your agent,

940
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:41,454
just to meet you once!

941
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:46,353
Why?

942
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:50,190
You're the chosen one Aafia.

943
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:53,256
I don't want anyone else but you.

944
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:56,299
But I don't love you.

945
01:24:58,493 --> 01:24:59,631
I know that.

946
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:20,315
Listen to what I am saying...

947
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:21,426

950
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,268
I'll shower you
with so much money

951
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:39,175
that you'll never
have to work again.

952
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:39,696
Are you in pain?

953
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,237
Look here.

954
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:35,122
Have you fallen for someone else?

955
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:05,640
Hello.

956
01:29:05,707 --> 01:29:06,344
Hi ma'am...

957
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,121

<i>Happy New Year Ms. Modâ!</i>

960
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:20,358
Oh! Happy New Year to you too!

961
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:22,227
What can I get you Ma'am?

962
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:25,027
Umm...
A strong cup of coffee.

963
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:25,571
OkayÂ»-

964
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:50,121
Are you okay?

965
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:13,780
What have you done to yourself?

966
01:30:14,142 --> 01:30:16,645
I saw her at the hotel.

967
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:27,562
Did you talk to her?

968
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:38,304
Raina...

969
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:41,411
came to Delhi from Calcutta.

970
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:45,416
She had run away
with her boyfriend.

971
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:47,811
She was just 17...

972
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:49,252
and pregnant.

973
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,187
Stop it now.

974
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:52,656
You?

975
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:54,552
âPersonal Trainerâ

976
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:01,998
You greedy little...

977
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:06,260
You don't have the right
to say anything about her-

978
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,437
That's enough.

979
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:19,444
Why is the ambience so lonely

980
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:23,045
and the gaze veiled

981
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,652
Why does the morning
feel like the night

982
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:30,152
every moment is stagnated

983
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:33,622
No rains of light

984
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:37,326
no peace and comfort

985
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:43,242
tell me lord what is the reason?

986
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:51,416
Every moment is lonely

987
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:54,681
gloomy
- the atmosphere

988
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:59,114
all the ones close to me are gone

989
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:01,725
Season of tears

990
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:03,485
What is this tradition

991
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:05,497
of every one distancing from you

992
01:32:05,553 --> 01:32:09,467
no one understands your passion

993
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:50,442
your heart desires only love

994
01:32:51,098 --> 01:32:53,476
immensely

995
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:57,809
your worship is your faith

996
01:32:58,139 --> 01:33:00,210
Aafia o pure one

997
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:04,657
one prayer, just one prayer

998
01:33:05,346 --> 01:33:08,293
hadn't asked for anything more

999
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:14,190
so why is everyone
so crossed with you

1000
01:33:16,123 --> 01:33:19,195
Aafia
- the pure one

1001
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:23,337
Where will one find
another like you

1002
01:33:29,704 --> 01:33:31,684
Kejriwal has a chance
of wining this election

1003
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:34,016
Yeah, I also think so.

1004
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:38,757
Congratulation!

1005
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:41,456
Now ready for your wedding night?

1006
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,696
You shouldn't have come here.

1007
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:56,795
Benoit spoke to me.

1008
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:31,628
Anu.

1009
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:33,400
I'm your mother.

1010
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:41,509
Anu...

1011
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:44,416
can you call me...

1012
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:45,675
Mom?

1013
01:35:58,452 --> 01:35:59,089
Thanks.

1014
01:35:59,153 --> 01:35:59,597
Welcome.

1015
01:36:16,137 --> 01:36:17,480
Just make a call, hmm...

1016
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:18,209
Okay.

1017
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,518
On behalf of Air India,
Captain Amar Kaushik

1018
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:22,451
and the crew...

1019
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:24,387
we welcome you on
board our Aircraft...

1020
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:27,016
boeing 787 dreamliner...

1021
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:30,290
Al-301 to Delhi vai Melbourne

1022
01:36:31,085 --> 01:36:31,529
Heyâ

1023
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:33,564
Sorry, were you sleeping?

1024
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:34,991
No.

1025
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:36,200
Was just going to the gym.

1026
01:36:39,059 --> 01:36:39,696
Okay.

1027
01:36:40,194 --> 01:36:41,400
Look your best.

1028
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:43,372
You know how important
this party is for me.

1029
01:36:43,998 --> 01:36:46,069
You don't need to tell me.

1030
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:47,111
Okay darling.

1031
01:36:58,312 --> 01:36:59,313
HaPPy new year, Sir!

1032
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:00,322
Happy new year...

1033
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:01,086
Sit!

1034
01:37:07,388 --> 01:37:08,389
Finally you are here.

1035
01:37:08,722 --> 01:37:10,224
I need you to do something.

1036
01:37:13,561 --> 01:37:15,131
Let me just put this inside.

1037
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:16,205
Wait wait...

1038
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:17,435
you give this to me and...

1039
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:20,569
just take the order
from table number 8.

1040
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:33,716
<i>âOm!</i>

1041
01:37:46,627 --> 01:37:47,332
Bye!

1042
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:48,396
Bye!

1043
01:38:12,019 --> 01:38:14,363
We will be moving to France.

1044
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:20,636
I can't call you âMaâ.

1045
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:26,268
Your dad

1046
01:38:26,467 --> 01:38:27,741
<i>Rahâ...</i>

1047
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,390
He was young...

1048
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,529
I'm sleepy sis...

1049
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:10,522
Do you mind if Azfar stays here?

1050
01:39:11,045 --> 01:39:12,615
Till he leaves Delhi.

1051
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:15,493
Mohan!

1052
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:18,662
My real name

1053
01:39:21,588 --> 01:39:23,192
My real name

1054
01:39:30,564 --> 01:39:31,599
Hi Mohan...

1055
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,974
Guess, Azfar was a greedy...

1056
01:39:38,072 --> 01:39:41,019
From my side I can assure you
totally in control.

1057
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:42,051
Absolutely...

1058
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:43,179
Okay, now no more business talk.

1059
01:39:43,277 --> 01:39:43,652
Hmm?

1060
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:45,190
Let him enjoy his meal.

1061
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:46,280
Hi Rohan, you are late

1062
01:39:49,283 --> 01:39:50,261
Sheila darling!

1063
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:51,159
Hi!

1064
01:39:52,052 --> 01:39:53,429
Sonal's close friend.
Rohan.

1065
01:39:54,221 --> 01:39:55,291
No one has your style.

1066
01:39:55,356 --> 01:39:56,164
Sonal...

1067
01:40:10,571 --> 01:40:11,549
Greetings from...

1068
01:40:11,605 --> 01:40:12,515
Azfar...

1069
01:40:12,606 --> 01:40:15,416
your personal trainer has resigned.

1070
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:22,617
Who is this Azfar, Sheila?

1071
01:40:24,752 --> 01:40:26,459
Well everyone knows about him...

1072
01:40:27,054 --> 01:40:28,499
except for you.

1073
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:45,382
Thank you ma'am.

1074
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:59,424
Ma'am, your card is blocked.

1075
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:03,428
Sorry Ma'am.

1076
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:17,716
Ma'am we can settle it later...

1077
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:22,612
Please inform my husband

1078
01:41:23,043 --> 01:41:26,616
that his wife has left
all this as guarantee.

1079
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,210
You know thatLlysee francais in
Delhi has excellent reputation.

1080
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:55,776
Yes!

1081
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:57,680
I am a very good professor

1082
01:41:57,811 --> 01:41:58,551
Good!

1083
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:03,059
I would love to speak to you
about other possibilities...

1084
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:06,098
Once I am back from Lycee,

1085
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:09,225
after 3 months holidays
starting February.

1086
01:42:10,357 --> 01:42:12,132
<i>Leis take a Same.</i>

1087
01:42:18,765 --> 01:42:20,767
Congratulations Nishant.

1088
01:42:28,408 --> 01:42:30,684
Keep him on a short leash.

1089
01:42:31,612 --> 01:42:33,216
Neil!

1090
01:42:38,752 --> 01:42:40,459
C'mon let's go.

1091
01:42:48,228 --> 01:42:49,639
I'm sorry.

1092
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:59,048
I'm worried about you.

1093
01:42:59,373 --> 01:43:00,511
Baljeet's dad...

1094
01:43:03,243 --> 01:43:04,449
I'll be fine.

1095
01:43:07,281 --> 01:43:08,692
And by tomorrow...

1096
01:43:09,516 --> 01:43:10,494
I'll be in France.

1097
01:43:19,626 --> 01:43:22,106
Why don't you come with me?.

1098
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:28,073
Won't you give me another chance?
