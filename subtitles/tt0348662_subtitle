1
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,760
Father..

2
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,000
..I have killed someone.

3
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,560
But I didn't do it deliberately.

4
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,040
It was an accident.

5
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,600
A terrible accident.

6
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,280
Father, I think that person is alive..

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,680
..and he wants to kill me.

8
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,480
Don't worry, Tanya.

9
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,120
How do you know my name?

10
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,320
Because I am alive.

11
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,160
What happened?

12
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,760
Nothing.

13
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,200
People have dreams.

14
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,760
But I..

15
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,800
..had a dream in my dream

16
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,680
'May I have your attention please?'

17
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,080
'Announcing the departure<br>of British Airways..'

18
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,560
'..flight VA437 from<br>London to New Delhi.'

19
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,280
'Passengers are requested<br>to board the aircraft.'

20
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,560
'Thank you.'

21
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,160
Are you also going to India? - Yes.

22
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,840
I am very excited. - Oh!

23
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,880
Wonder how I will<br>spend these eight hours.

24
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
Going for business trip?

25
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,920
I am going to meet someone.

26
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,120
Someone special.

27
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,400
Wonder where he must be right now,<br>how he must be.

28
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,600
If you loved him so much,<br>why did you come to London?

29
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
Something happened..

30
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,000
What happened?

31
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,880
Something happened..

32
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,040
..because of which we separated.

33
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,040
But now I have understood.

34
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,760
If you want to live your life,<br>you shouldn't run away from it.

35
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,080
I am going back to live my life.

36
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,760
Where? Shimla?

37
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,200
No. Delhi. - I see.

38
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
Now we have shifted to Delhi.

39
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
But I tell you.<br>Those days in Shimla were the best.

40
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,880
Great days.

41
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,280
Dad. Dad.

42
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,880
Dad.

43
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,960
Too good, dad.

44
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,760
Listen. - Bye, dad.

45
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,360
At least have breakfast.

46
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,160
Hi, Karan. - Hi.

47
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,720
Going to college in your Mercedes?

48
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,200
On such a smooth road<br>even a cycle runs like a car.

49
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
And it's a kind of<br>exercise too. - Okay.

50
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,680
See you in college.

51
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,360
After three hours.

52
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,720
"Yeah. Yeah."

53
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,240
See you in college. After three hours.

54
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
Hey!

55
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,720
"Yeah. Yeah."

56
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,800
"Yeah. Yeah."

57
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,440
"Why does this happen?"

58
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,120
"Why does this happen?"

59
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,160
"We lose our slumber."

60
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,480
"We lose our solace."

61
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,760
"We lose our life."

62
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,880
"We fall in love."

63
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,360
"You will know when<br>you will experience it."

64
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,920
"That is when you will believe me."

65
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,040
"We lose our slumber."

66
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,200
"We lose our solace."

67
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,400
"We lose our life."

68
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,720
"We fall in love."

69
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,160
"Why does this happen?"

70
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,040
"Why does this happen?"

71
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,640
"What scenarios! - It's ours."

72
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
"The days of fun."

73
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,160
"The moments.. - Will pass."

74
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,000
"Count it on your fingers."

75
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,640
"What scenarios!<br>It's ours. What scenarios!"

76
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,320
"Imagine.<br>What will we do by studying?"

77
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,800
"We are going to<br>be good-for-nothings."

78
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,280
"Leave it. Forget it, my friend."

79
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,920
"This girl is not less<br>than an electric current."

80
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,360
"Why does this happen?"

81
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,240
"Why does this happen?"

82
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,560
"So beautiful. - So young."

83
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,400
"So amazing."

84
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,920
"Tell me..<br>- What do you.. - Think about it."

85
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,480
"So beautiful. So young."

86
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,200
"Every beautiful<br>girl is crazy for me."

87
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,760
"She gives me her heart."

88
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,160
"So much love. So much mischief."

89
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,880
"This style is different<br>from the rest."

90
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,320
"Why does this happen?"

91
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,720
"Why does this happen?"

92
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,280
"Why does this happen?"

93
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,200
"Why does this happen?"

94
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,880
"When hearts meet covertly."

95
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,840
"Love blossoms in the heart."

96
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,720
"Desires remain silent."

97
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,640
"We communicate our<br>love through our eyes."

98
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,280
"Why does this happen?"

99
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,320
"Why does this happen?"

100
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:29,080
"Why does this happen?"

101
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:39,040
"Why does this happen?"

102
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,520
Karan! - Move! Karan

103
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Did you hear? Did you hear? - What?

104
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,000
Heard what?<br>- I will know only when you tell me.

105
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,200
He is back. - Who?

106
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,720
Professor Bakshi.

107
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,040
But why did he kill his wife?

108
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,840
Simple, ma'am.<br>He had gone crazy. What else?

109
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,920
How can his wife disappear?

110
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,440
Maybe she has gone<br>to her maternal house.

111
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,120
Or maybe she has left him.

112
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,280
If he had not killed his wife,<br>his wife would have killed him.

113
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,280
Let it be.<br>So what if he killed his wife?

114
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,360
What? So what?

115
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,800
It's a crime, Yash.

116
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,840
But Tanya, it has not been proved.

117
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,160
It could be a rumor too.

118
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,440
Yes. He is a little barmy.

119
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,400
Do you remember?<br>Once Vicky was playing basketball.

120
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,160
Mistakenly the ball<br>hit professor Bakshi.

121
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,320
'Sorry, sir.'

122
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,680
He is not crazy.

123
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,080
He is mental.

124
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
He is mad.

125
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,840
Look, professor Bakshi.

126
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,640
I can't promise to<br>give you a permanent job.

127
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,280
You can join. We will see how it goes.

128
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,240
You can go now.

129
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,040
And yes.

130
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,320
If I receive another complaint<br>about you, I will throw you out.

131
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,840
Are you ready for exam?

132
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,440
Sir! Good morning, sir!

133
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,440
Sir, I am Vishal Joshi.

134
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,720
You were going to give me notes, sir.

135
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,960
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

136
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,440
Are you crazy? I don't care for Tanya.

137
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,040
I don't have time.<br>- I don't have time.

138
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,480
Is that so? You don't care for Tanya?

139
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,080
Because Yash and Tanya..<br>- What? Both of them what?

140
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,520
Whatever it is. Why are you bothered?

141
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,360
I am asking just like that. Time pass.

142
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,560
By the way,<br>what's going on between them?

143
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,720
Both do dance rehearsal<br>for three hours everyday.

144
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,840
They must be having an affair.

145
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,520
Moron. Just because<br>they are together..

146
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,480
..doesn't mean they<br>are having an affair.

147
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,640
Hi.

148
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
The moon rises at night.

149
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,120
How did it rise during the day today?

150
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,680
An owl hoots at night.

151
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,800
How did it hoot during the day today?

152
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
Laugh as much as you want.

153
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,280
Only till prom night.

154
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,800
Wait and watch.<br>She will be in my arms.

155
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,920
Yes.

156
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,880
"It never felt so wonderful. Oh my!"

157
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,640
"My heart thumps when I see you."

158
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,440
"What enchantment lies in you,<br>beloved?"

159
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,360
"I swear."

160
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,840
"I am yours."

161
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,840
"I am yours. My heart is yours.<br>My life is yours. Oh my!"

162
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,680
"It never felt so wonderful. Oh my!"

163
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,680
"My heart thumps when I see you."

164
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,680
"What enchantment lies in you,<br>beloved?"

165
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,440
"I swear."

166
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,960
"I am yours."

167
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,920
"I am yours. My heart is yours.<br>My life is yours. Oh my!"

168
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,360
"It never felt so wonderful. Oh my!"

169
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,600
"My heart thumps when I see you."

170
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,720
"Oh my!"

171
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,680
"Oh my!"

172
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,240
"Oh my!"

173
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,160
"Oh my!"

174
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,480
"Your dark eyes and silky tresses."

175
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,120
"Your beautiful face and soft lips."

176
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,320
"I have gone crazy."

177
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,600
"Everything seems new."

178
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,400
"It never felt so wonderful. Oh my!"

179
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,000
"My heart thumps when I see you."

180
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,480
"Oh my!"

181
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,440
"Oh my!"

182
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,000
"Oh my!"

183
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,640
"Oh my!"

184
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,520
"I am lost in your sweet talks."

185
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,160
"It seems I have also gone crazy."

186
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,800
"You don't know."

187
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,680
"My lips are quiet."

188
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,000
"It never felt so wonderful. Oh my!"

189
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,520
"My heart thumps when I see you."

190
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,760
"Oh my!"

191
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,640
"Oh my!"

192
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,080
"Oh my!"

193
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,480
"Oh my!"

194
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,280
"Oh my!"

195
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,240
"Oh my!"

196
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,680
"Oh my!"

197
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,480
"Oh my!"

198
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,920
Yes! Come on! Quickly!

199
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,520
Yes!

200
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,080
One, two, three, four.

201
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,800
Boys, all of you know that<br>tomorrow is the final match..

202
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
..of the open university tournament.

203
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,800
Like every year we have<br>to win the match this year too.

204
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,840
Because it's the question<br>of our college's and my reputation.

205
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,880
Okay? - Yes, sir. - Good

206
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,440
Yash!

207
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,400
Bhalla sir is right.

208
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
Hero is the one who<br>makes his people win.

209
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,320
Our college should win. Okay?

210
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,360
Of course.

211
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,080
I lost the golden chance to<br>impress Tanya. - What do you mean?

212
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,480
I am not in the basketball team.

213
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,600
Karan, don't worry.

214
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,240
Just voice it. Say it.

215
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,160
We will make you the captain<br>of the basketball team. - Yes.

216
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,640
Then our college's<br>team will surely lose.

217
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,040
You moron. Love is very powerful.

218
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,680
Karan can even win the cricket<br>world cup, leave alone basketball.

219
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,160
Yes. - But how?

220
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,720
Daddy, what is your last wish?<br>- Dear, my last wish is..

221
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,080
What do you mean?

222
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,000
Your life is unpredictable.<br>Anything can happen to you anytime.

223
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,800
So I thought I will ask<br>you your last wish every night.

224
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,920
My sweet child.

225
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,800
Dear, my last wish is that.. - Yes.

226
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,280
My last wish is that..

227
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,600
My last wish is that..

228
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,040
Yes!

229
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,920
Let's go fast.

230
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,480
Dolly, why did you<br>give him 10 sleeping pills?

231
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,640
You don't know my father.

232
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,760
One or two pills<br>would not have worked.

233
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,600
Tie him. - Yes. Come on.

234
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,600
Take out the ropes. Come on. Come on.

235
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,120
What are you looking at?<br>You also tie him.

236
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,280
Yes.

237
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
This rope is..

238
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,080
Be quick. Give me the rope.

239
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
Yes. - Tie him tightly.

240
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,840
Your father is very heavy.

241
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,800
You told me at the last moment,<br>darling.

242
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,680
Otherwise I would have<br>put him on a diet for a week.

243
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,880
Hi. - Oh God! Hurry up.

244
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,080
Yes. I miss you too, darling.

245
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,760
We are kidnapping daddy.

246
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,880
Ransom?

247
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,160
Even if someone demands, who will pay?

248
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,720
Yes. It is daddy's day out.

249
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,320
Hey! Left!

250
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,680
Right!

251
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,360
Do you know? My nail got<br>chipped while I was tying daddy.

252
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,600
Daddy will come back.<br>When will I get my nail back?

253
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,080
Yes, baby. I love you.

254
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,000
I love you. I love you. Yes.

255
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,960
Yeah! Come on, guys.

256
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,880
We have to win. Best of luck. Yes!

257
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,080
Where is professor Bhalla?

258
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,120
I don't know, ma'am. - Oh God!

259
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,840
Who will announce the team?

260
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes, darling.

261
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,560
Dolly. Where is your father?

262
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,160
Hold on a second. He is not coming.

263
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,000
Not coming?<br>- He has sent this letter for you.

264
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,280
Hello. Yes. What were you saying?

265
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,600
How dare he send me a love letter!

266
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,160
Hold on.<br>Hold on. It's not a love letter.

267
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,480
It's the final names<br>of the team. - Oh!

268
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,280
Yes. What?

269
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,160
Oh God! - Yes.

270
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,160
And the final team of our college is..

271
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,960
Rahul Singh.

272
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,880
Wilson Fernandez.

273
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,920
And the captain of the team is..

274
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Karan.

275
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,880
Karan Kapoor.

276
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,880
What is this, ma'am?

277
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,920
I don't know. Ask professor Bhalla.

278
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
Bring tea, Dolly.

279
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,480
Oh my!

280
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,600
The game begins.

281
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,040
There is good throw..<br>here Karan has fell down.

282
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,440
And the ball is Captain<br>Kapil hand.. he did goal.

283
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,360
Hey! Ball!

284
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,960
Ball!

285
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,920
Come on.

286
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,560
Yes!

287
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,000
What is this? Karan put the<br>ball in the other team's basket..

288
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,640
..due to which Xavier's<br>college has lost.

289
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,360
And the other college is the champion.<br>- Oh, shit!

290
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,920
Karan. Hey! Did you go to sleep?

291
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,960
I have made delicious food.

292
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,800
I have made stuffed flatbread for you.

293
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,040
Come on. Come on. Get up.

294
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,120
Come on. We will have dinner.

295
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,200
And after that..

296
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Look, if you don't get up,<br>I will start singing.

297
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,520
"We will succeed." - Dad.

298
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,920
"We will succeed." - Dad, please.

299
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,160
Amazing, son!

300
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,920
You have only lost a match.

301
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,600
And you are so upset.

302
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,440
Dad, everyone lost because of me.

303
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,320
Everyone was laughing at me.

304
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,360
I am a loser, dad.

305
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,720
Look, humans make mistakes.

306
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
If humans don't make mistakes..

307
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,640
..won't they become God?

308
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,360
You are my brave boy, Karan.

309
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,160
Come on. Get up. Let's have dinner.

310
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,440
Fine. Take this handkerchief.

311
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,640
Cry your heart out.I<br>will switch off the light.

312
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,280
Very good, son!

313
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,960
Dad.

314
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,720
I am hungry.

315
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,000
That's better. Come on. Hurry up.

316
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,880
What?

317
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,320
Stupid.

318
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,840
One, two, three, four.

319
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,520
And side.

320
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,600
And keep going.

321
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,320
And side.

322
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,720
Left, side and turn.

323
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,800
Very good.

324
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,280
And out.

325
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,840
And hands out.

326
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,760
And turn.

327
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,600
One, two, three.<br>And one, two, three, go.

328
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,120
Very good. One, two,<br>three, four, five, six, seven and..

329
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,320
Karan!

330
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,800
Karan! Karan! Karan, stop! Stop!

331
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,160
You like Tanya, don't you?

332
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,400
No. - Listen.

333
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,440
Why are you afraid if you love her?

334
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,320
Look, if you like Tanya,<br>I can help you come closer to her.

335
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,240
Yes. She is a good friend of mine.

336
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,560
I can bring Tanya closer to you.

337
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,920
But.. - But what?

338
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,160
You will also have<br>to help me win my love.

339
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,120
How can I help you?

340
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,160
You are an expert in this matter.

341
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,920
You can entice a girl in a jiffy.

342
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,920
I used to do that.<br>But now I have changed.

343
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,080
I am a serious guy. I have reformed.

344
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,760
Since the time I have<br>fallen in love with Natasha..

345
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,560
Natasha? - Yes.

346
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,600
I have lost my slumber.

347
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,960
I have lost my solace.

348
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,760
You like Natasha? - Yes.

349
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,000
Are you serious?

350
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,840
Of course. I have left all that.

351
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,840
I went to Vaishnodevi for my father.<br>See this. The dot.

352
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,520
And yes, I have got the offering too.

353
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,760
Take it. Take it.<br>Goddess will help you too.

354
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,480
Do something, Karan.<br>Now I can't control it.

355
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,360
Please do something for me.<br>- Yash. - Yes.

356
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,720
The evening's rehearsal is cancelled.

357
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
We will do it tomorrow. Okay? Bye.

358
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,160
So what have you thought?

359
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,000
Fine. I can help you.

360
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,880
But Natasha is not your type.

361
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,440
Even Tanya is not your type.

362
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,280
No. I mean she is a very decent girl.

363
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,760
You won't ditch her, will you?

364
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,040
You won't ditch Tanya, will you?

365
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,280
No. I will talk to her about you.

366
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,720
Deal? Tanya will<br>be yours by prom night.

367
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,640
Come on. Shake hands, man. My friend.

368
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,480
Sir.

369
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,880
Sir.

370
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,160
Sir.

371
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,880
Hello.

00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,440
Hi.

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,160
No. I have come to sir's<br>house to take the notes.

374
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,040
I know it's the prom night.<br>I will come.

375
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,400
Bye.

376
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,520
Sir.

377
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,720
Sir.

378
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,040
Sir.

379
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,240
Sir.

380
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,200
Sir.

381
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,120
Sir.

382
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,360
Sir.

383
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,480
You were going to give the notes. So..

384
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,560
Sir..the notes.

385
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,520
I didn't see anything.<br>I didn't see anything.

386
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,400
Tashu. Hello, Tashu.

387
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,880
Tashu. Here. For you. - What is this?

388
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,480
A gift from someone who loves you.

389
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,000
But.. - No buts.

390
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,080
Someone might not be<br>able to tell you his feelings.

391
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,400
But he can express it through a gift.

392
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,120
Please. Don't refuse the gift.

393
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,280
'Tonight is the prom night.'

394
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,040
'Tonight Karan will be with me.'

395
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,400
'Tonight is the prom night.'

396
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,160
'Tonight Tanya will be with me.'

397
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,520
"Have a puff."

398
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,040
"All your sorrows.." Come on.

399
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,880
"Say it morning.."

400
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,920
Vishal, don't you want<br>to come for the prom?

401
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,120
You got scared?

402
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,760
He got scared.<br>- Why did you get scared? Tell me.

403
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,120
Tell me. Yes. It's about a girl.

404
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,160
Where is she? Tell me. Where is she?

405
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,200
Tell me

406
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,120
Okay. Forget that. Listen.

407
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,240
We are going.

408
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,720
Because if my Dolly<br>falls for someone..

409
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,200
..my life will become forlorn.Got it?

410
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,160
Get ready quickly and come.

411
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,520
Pat, wait. - What happened? Tell me.

412
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,320
I went there for the notes..<br>- What notes? Come on.

413
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,680
Pat!

414
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,840
He will study during the prom.

415
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,440
Who?

416
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,840
Karan, see..

417
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,960
Hello, everybody.

418
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,560
I am so glad to see<br>that you all look..

419
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,080
..as if you are straight<br>out of the 1970s.

420
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,680
Yeah!

421
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,600
As per the college's tradition..

422
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,040
..today there will be<br>a blast in the prom night.

423
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,000
Yeah!

424
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,400
The prom queen this year is Ms.<br>Tanya Oberoi.

425
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,240
Tanya will come.

426
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Leave my hand, Karan. It hurts.

427
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
And the prom king is Mr. Yash Tonk.

428
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,040
Yeah!

429
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,520
They will present their dance item.

430
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,560
Yeah!

431
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,960
I am sorry, guys.<br>I fell down from the bike.

432
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,320
But no need to be disappointed.

433
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,440
Because Karan will<br>perform in my place today.

434
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,520
Come on, Karan. Come on the stage.

435
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,680
If you perform on the stage,<br>it will look absolutely weird.

436
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,400
Have you gone crazy? No. Quiet.

437
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,040
Stop. Leave him.

438
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,040
Make him dance. Leave him.

439
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,720
You guys are..

440
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,880
The show must go on.

441
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,720
"My..my heart."

442
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,440
"Listen..it's yours."

443
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,120
"Just tell me."

444
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,280
"When, why, where?"

445
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,160
"How it happened?"

446
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,720
"Both are lost in their youths."

447
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,960
"A little awake. A little asleep."

448
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,800
"It would never happen before."

449
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:07,320
"What all things have<br>started happening to me!"

450
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,720
"My..my heart."

451
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,600
"You have attacked me fatally."

452
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,120
"I have lost my heart."

453
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,640
"I couldn't control it."

454
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,240
"Let it suffer and be in torment."

455
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,840
"My lover, leave it."

456
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,200
"The fun lies in losing."

457
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,840
"There is some magic in your charms."

458
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,440
"My crazy heartbeat<br>is also uncontrollable."

459
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,640
"I found you, my beloved."

460
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:04,400
"Wonder where I lost myself."

461
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,440
"You are still immature.<br>You are still nave."

462
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,280
"You won't understand<br>the desires of the heart."

463
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,080
"Tell me also about these desires."

464
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,880
"Tell me also what love is."

465
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,680
"Leave it, beloved."

466
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,160
"How the saga of love is formed!"

467
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,400
"You are under oath, my beloved."

468
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:00,120
"Don't increase the fervor."

469
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,400
"My..my heart."

470
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,160
"Listen..it's yours."

471
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,040
"Just tell me."

472
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,400
"When, why, where?"

473
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,000
"How it happened?"

474
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:38,200
Yeah!

475
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,040
Yeah!

476
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,560
Karan, you were amazing!

477
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,640
Bravo!

478
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,080
I had planned something else.

479
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
But he became a hero.

480
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,360
Karan! Karan! - Yeah!

481
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,880
Karan! - See the spirit.

482
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,440
Let's go, guys. - Karan.

483
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,400
Hi, Karan.<br>Did you see? I made you a hero.

484
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,360
Look, your heroine is looking at you.<br>- Is that so?

485
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,320
Don't just talk. Go to her.

486
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
And listen

487
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,520
. You did my work, didn't you?

488
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,720
Yes. Tashu has worn your dress.

489
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,520
My friend.

490
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,960
Glory to Goddess! Yes!

491
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,120
It was very difficult.<br>I don't know how I did it.

492
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,320
Hi. - Hi.

493
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,080
I didn't know you dance so well.

494
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,200
I also found out today only.

495
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,680
Actually, I learnt it by seeing you.

496
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,920
Really? - Yes.

497
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,040
Oh!

498
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,840
So won't you give<br>your teacher a treat?

499
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,520
My pleasure.

500
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,840
Ice-cream.

501
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,560
I don't mind. - Come on.

502
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,440
Yash, mind your own business.

503
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,240
Come on, sweetie.<br>It is the prom night.

504
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Let's be friends.<br>Move aside. Move aside.

505
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,840
If you had to show attitude,<br>why did you wear the clothes I sent?

506
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,120
What?

507
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,880
You had sent these clothes?

508
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,560
Of course. What did you think?

509
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,960
That pauper Karan has bought it?

510
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,520
Where is Karan? Where is Karan?

511
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,800
He is there. I will take you to him.

512
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,160
Yes!

513
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,280
This. - Yes, sir?

514
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,040
Soda? Only soda?

515
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,440
Or would you prefer<br>some flavor with soda?

516
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,400
Which other flavors do you have?

517
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,360
Sir, we have raspberry,<br>strawberry and blueberry.

518
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,240
Tell me, Tanya.<br>Which berry do you like?

519
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,720
Raspberry, strawberry or blueberry?

520
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,280
Soda with strawberry ice-cream.

521
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,440
Bring two of what she said.<br>- Okay, sir.

522
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,960
What happened?

523
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,960
Nothing. Nothing.

524
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,400
Maybe dad remembered me.

525
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,720
Your order, sir.

526
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,080
What is this? - Bill.

527
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,880
Only Rs.700, sir.

528
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,400
Only?

529
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,960
What are you doing?

530
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,760
Do you accept credit card? - Yes, sir.

531
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,800
Okay. Nowadays India<br>has prospered a lot.

532
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,480
Which credit card do you accept?

533
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,160
Any, sir. - I have three.

534
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,080
It was here only. I don't know.

535
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,520
Don't worry. I will pay today.

536
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,080
As it is,<br>you danced really well today.

537
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,280
Let me give you a treat.

538
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,280
Since you are insisting..

539
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,560
But next time it's my turn. Okay?

540
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,840
Okay

541
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,560
Leave that.<br>What are you doing with him?

542
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
What do you mean what I am doing?

543
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,840
He is my friend. You know, daddy.

544
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,880
I love him.

545
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,080
Love? Do you even<br>know the meaning of love?

546
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,280
Yes. It's what Karisma (Hindi<br>actress) and Aamir (Hindi actor)..

547
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,280
..did in 'Raja Hindustani'<br>(Hindi movie) in the rains.

548
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,920
Hey! Do you truly love her? - Yes.

549
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,280
Then why don't you get married?

550
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,120
The whole world knows about our love.

551
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,440
Now who will marry us?

552
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,280
Karan. - Karan must be coming.

553
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,000
Coffee. Sit.

554
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,720
Natasha, today I will tell<br>you a tragic story of my life.

555
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,200
After hearing it..

556
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,760
..You.

557
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,240
When I was a kid,<br>I was sleeping on my mother's lap.

558
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,520
Stop it.

559
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,600
Suddenly I woke up<br>and I started crying.

560
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,480
My mother lovingly.. - Stop it.

561
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,720
If you hear my tragic story,<br>you will also become emotional.

562
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,920
When I was a kid.. - Then what?

563
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,800
We were very poor.

564
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,600
My papa used to dance in a beer bar.

565
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,360
You know, beer bar.

566
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,960
Papa in beer bar?

567
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,920
Yes. Only women used to<br>come there to drink. - Rubbish.

568
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,280
He got addicted to drinking.

569
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
And his eyes used<br>to swell after drinking.

570
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,560
His lips turned black due to smoking.<br>- Damn it!

571
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,200
Natasha, listen.

572
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,360
Natasha, listen..

573
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,280
Natasha, what is the hurry?

574
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,440
First my childhood.. - Narrate<br>your childhood tales to your children.

575
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,200
Come on, baby.<br>I will drop you. - Get lost!

576
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,640
What happened to him?

577
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,880
Thanks.

578
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,000
Ouch

579
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,400
Are you okay? - Yes.

580
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,280
Such an incident happening<br>in our college is a shameful thing.

581
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,520
Studies are important.

582
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,400
But there shouldn't<br>be so much pressure..

583
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
..that it drives students<br>to commit suicide.

584
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,600
So in the future all<br>of you bear it in mind.

585
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,800
All of you may leave.

586
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,520
Yes?

587
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,040
Do you want to say something?

588
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,800
He is crazy. He shouldn't<br>have been so stressed about exams.

589
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,400
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

590
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,640
At the most he would<br>have failed. - Yes.

591
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,120
You are right.

592
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,280
If he had waited for a few days..

593
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,160
..he would have learnt<br>something from you.

594
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,920
Stop! - Help, Karan!

595
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,800
I think my old style of<br>enticing girls was the best.

596
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,000
I will have to try that out.

597
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,720
Look, she has come.

598
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,920
Hi, Natasha.

599
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,280
There is a party at my friend's<br>farmhouse. Will you come?

600
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,640
We will have fun.

601
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,640
Move from my way.

602
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,200
I won't narrate childhood tales.<br>- Stop it.

603
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,360
Just come for my party.<br>You will have fun. Believe me.

604
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,720
Yash, leave her hand.<br>- Karan. - Leave her hand.

605
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,720
Karan. Karan. Listen, you<br>also wanted me to come closer to her.

606
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,440
That's what I am doing. Yeah, baby.

607
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
I told you. Leave her hand.

608
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,640
We had a deal, right?

609
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,160
I will bring Tanya closer to you and<br>you will bring me closer to Natasha.

610
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,480
Kidding.

611
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,200
Your friend is a ****.

612
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,600
Karan!

613
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,800
Stop it, Karan! Karan, stop it!

614
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,040
What are you doing, Karan? Stop it.

615
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,560
Tashu. Tashu.

616
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,920
Tashu. - Karan, I never imagined..

617
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,320
..you would do this with me.

618
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,680
Yash told me..

619
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,320
I thought he has changed.<br>Can I do this?

620
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,120
Can I sacrifice friendship for love?

621
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,240
Tashu, I can never hurt you.

622
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,160
What happened?

623
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,120
Karan, let's go home.

624
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,520
How does it feel? - Good.

625
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,800
I mean, you have applied ointment.

626
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,080
So it's feeling better.

627
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,800
Uncle, I..

628
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,720
Karan

629
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,120
Karan.

630
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,200
See who has come to meet you. Come.

631
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,840
I am sorry, Karan.<br>My friends had instigated me.

632
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,040
That's why I behaved insolently.

633
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,680
I swear by God.<br>I will never repeat this mistake.

634
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,960
I swear.

635
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,640
Natasha,<br>you will forgive me, won't you?

636
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,240
And Karan, thank you so much.

637
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,200
If you had not saved<br>me from the principal..

638
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,680
..I would have never been<br>able to appear for the exams.

639
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,080
That's the spirit.

640
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,920
Come on. On this note shake hands.

641
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,840
And Yash, your punishment is that..

642
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,880
..you will have to be<br>Karan's best friend forever.

643
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,800
It's a deal.

644
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,320
Thank you so much, Karan.

645
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,200
And Natasha, sorry once again.

646
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,240
It's okay.

647
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,200
Okay, uncle. Thank you. - Okay. Okay.

648
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,280
Bye. - Bye. - Bye.

649
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,480
Good boy.

650
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,160
Karan

651
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,560
I will leave.

652
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,200
Bye. - Bye.

653
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,760
Karan.

654
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,280
Karan.

655
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,280
Bye. - Tanya.

656
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,040
Shall we go for coffee?

657
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,320
Karan.

658
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:44,840
"My heart is asking you."

659
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,200
"Will you love me?" - Karan,<br>What are doing?

660
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,400
"Me."

661
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,240
"Me."

662
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,960
Yash. - Yes.<br>- Have you studied this time?

663
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,720
This time I will score distinction..

664
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,080
..and I will top the university.<br>Distinction.

665
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,720
Look. Distinction.

666
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,440
See..

667
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,920
What?

668
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,480
Karan, give me.

669
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,640
What happened? - Give me.

670
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,360
Karan, show me. Please, Karan.

671
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,320
Tanya. Tanya.

672
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,440
Karan. - Sir.

673
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,720
It's my fault.

674
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,040
Oh!

675
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,480
I didn't expect this from you, Tanya.<br>Leave the class.

676
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,400
Sir. Sir. - Don't interfere.

677
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,080
Didn't you hear?

678
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,840
Tanya, why don't you..<br>- Stop it, Karan.

679
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,240
Sir. - This is a classroom.

680
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,200
Get to your seat and write the paper.

681
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,200
Tanya! Tanya!

682
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,440
Tanya!

683
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
Tanya, what is this?

684
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,280
Look at me. What have you done?

685
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,560
You had not even<br>written half the paper.

686
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,200
You know, you will fail.

687
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,760
I know.

688
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,120
How could you do this?

689
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,200
You studied the whole year<br>because you wanted to score.

690
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,000
You wanted to top the college.

691
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,440
You didn't even think that<br>your whole year will be wasted.

692
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,320
You would have also wasted a year.

693
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,400
It was my mistake.<br>Why did you take the blame?

694
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,760
Why did you do this? Why?

695
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,280
Because I love you.

696
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,200
Tanya, I won't let<br>your year be wasted.

697
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,120
I will do something.

698
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,600
Tonight we will have to<br>change Tanya's answer sheet.

699
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,720
It means cheating.

700
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,680
Hey! We will be in<br>trouble if we are caught.

701
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,760
No. Final exam's papers are<br>sent to another college for checking.

702
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,880
No one will find out.

703
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,760
Before the answer<br>sheet's bundle is sent..

704
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,240
..we will have to go to<br>professor Bakshi's house tonight..

705
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,760
..and change Tanya's answer sheet.

706
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,800
But going to professor<br>Bakshi's house is so risky.

707
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,800
You know, don't you?

708
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,320
I know. But I have decided. - Karan.

709
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,720
I don't think you<br>should do this. Please.

710
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,640
Please listen to me.<br>- Don't stop me, Tashu.

711
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,080
It's the question of Tanya's career.

712
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,840
I won't let her year be wasted.

713
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,240
If you don't want to come,<br>then don't come.

714
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,000
I will go myself. I will go alone.

715
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,400
Wait! My benevolent Karan,<br>we will also come with you.

716
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,400
Of course. We will die together.

717
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,520
And die together. - Yeah.

718
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,680
Hello. - Hello, Tanya.

719
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,280
Karan has gone to<br>professor Bakshi's house..

720
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,280
..to replace your paper. - What!

721
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,960
Stop. Stop here.

722
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,560
He is leaving.

723
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,120
He is leaving.

724
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,800
He is leaving. He is leaving.

725
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,480
Karan. Karan.

726
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,520
Come on. Come on.

727
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,640
Come on. Come quickly.

728
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,040
You go there. Tashu, you check there.

729
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,120
Kuch, you go there.

730
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,560
Come on. Check there.

731
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,160
Yash, found it.

732
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,800
Very good. Very good.<br>What is the roll number? - 3126.

733
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,120
You take out the answer sheet.<br>I will open the page.

734
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,480
Hurry up. Hurry up.

735
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,040
Where is Karan? - He is inside.

736
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,600
Tanya, no. Tanya, no.

737
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,080
Come on. Hurry up.<br>He will be back. - Karan.

738
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,520
Karan, stop it.<br>Karan, what you are doing is wrong.

739
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,400
Don't do that, Karan.<br>- What are you doing? Hurry up.

740
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,160
Karan, listen to me.<br>- Go out quickly. Tanya, quiet.

741
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,840
Please. Stop it. - It's done.

742
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,000
Karan, please stop it.<br>- Come on. Hurry up.

743
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,880
Karan, run! Karan!

744
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,520
Sir! - Kill me!

745
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,400
Karan! - Karan, come on!

746
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,160
Come on. Come on. Hurry up.

747
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,480
Come on. Come on.

748
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,960
Karan! Karan!

749
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,240
Karan, run! Karan, run!

750
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,080
Karan, I forbade you, didn't I?

751
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,440
Still why did you do that?

752
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,000
Karan, what will happen now?

753
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,240
Karan, he did kill his wife.

754
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,960
I had told you. He has killed<br>his wife. It's not a rumor.

755
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,760
But..but why did he<br>hide the body in his house?

756
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,720
All of you saw the body. Right?

757
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,920
That's it. Now he won't spare us.

758
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,920
Karan..what is in your hand?

759
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,080
Oh no! - Oh God!

760
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,240
Tanya!

761
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,640
Oh God!

762
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,720
What is it? Come on.

763
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,240
Explain to them.

764
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,280
Come on. Why are we standing here?<br>Let's go.

765
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,320
What are you saying?<br>Let's check what has happened.

766
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,920
I think he is dead.

767
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,680
I killed the professor!

768
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,360
No, Tanya! - I killed the professor!

769
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,760
It was an accident.

770
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,600
Let's inform the police.<br>- Are you crazy?

771
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,760
If we inform the police,<br>there will be a police case.

772
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,400
We will get into trouble. But<br>Tanya will get into deeper trouble.

773
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,600
The entire college knows that today..

774
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,240
..Tanya was thrown out<br>of the examination hall.

775
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,760
Look, I say let's leave quietly.

776
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,720
What are you saying? Let him check.

777
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,400
No. Let's go. Let's go.

778
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,800
Please let's go. - Let's go.

779
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,800
Listen to me. Maybe he is alive.

780
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,480
Karan, let's go.

781
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,840
Karan!

782
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,920
Oh God!

783
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,280
Any problem?

784
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,760
No, sir. No problem.

785
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,040
Have you come to dance<br>in the middle of the road?

786
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,360
We can do anything.<br>Who are you to ask?

787
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,240
Who am I? Who am I?

788
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,080
So what if I am not..

789
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,200
..an inspector?

790
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,120
Can't I ask all of<br>you what you are doing?

791
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,920
It's our duty to<br>help a person in need.

792
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,800
Any problem?

793
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,800
No. No. No.<br>I wanted to relieve myself.

794
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,440
Don't you have a toilet at home?

795
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,200
Yes. But I had to go immediately.

796
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,920
Yes. The thrill of doing<br>it in the open air is different.

797
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,840
Whenever I want to relieve myself,<br>I also go out.

798
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,560
Have fun.<br>Enjoy yourself. Come on. Take care.

799
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,160
You don't mind if I<br>also relieve myself, do you?

800
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,520
"Someone is missing."

801
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,880
"Someone is slandered."

802
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,280
"Who knows.."

803
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,400
Who is he?

804
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,840
Who is he? - Well..

805
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,960
We don't know.

806
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,000
If you don't know, can't I tell you?

807
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,520
He must be someone.

808
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,920
What do we care?

809
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,880
But humans should help each other.

810
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,480
Not drunkards.

811
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,080
He must be sloshed.

812
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,040
See you. Bye. Okay.

813
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,200
Thank God.

814
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,160
Relax.

815
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,360
You are too good, Tanya.<br>You are too good.

816
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,120
If you had not run<br>over Bakshi last night..

817
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,240
..today all of us would<br>have been in trouble in college.

818
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,600
All would have been<br>rusticated from college.

819
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,400
What driving! Bang!

820
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,480
What justice, man! What justice!

821
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,560
Karan, the police have<br>found the body of Bakshi's wife.

822
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,560
The police think he was<br>running away out of this fear.

823
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,760
She is mind-blowing.

824
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,760
Tanya. Tanya.

825
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,120
You are also..<br>Is this the time to talk like that?

826
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,960
Tanya.

827
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,320
How much? How much? - Rs.500.

828
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,240
How much? - Rs.500.

829
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,480
Okay.

830
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,560
We don't accept credit card.

831
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,000
No.

832
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,040
Do you have a phone?

833
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,640
What? - Do you have a phone?

834
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,160
Yes. That way.

835
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,760
Listen.

836
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,280
Listen to me.

837
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,720
Stop! Stop!

838
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,320
Stop! Stop!

839
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,120
Stop! Stop!

840
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,760
Stop! Stop!

841
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,160
Don't start the car!<br>Don't start the car!

842
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,640
Stop! I say stop! Stop!

843
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,040
Stop! Stop!

844
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,960
Tanya, what happened?

845
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,360
Karan, professor Bakshi. - Where?

846
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,720
In the car.

847
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,480
Tanya, no one is in the car.<br>- No, Karan.

848
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,880
Karan, I saw. - No one is here.

849
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,640
I saw him myself, Karan.

850
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,000
Control yourself, Tanya. - No, Karan.

851
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,040
Tanya. - No, Karan.

852
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,560
No one is here. - Karan.

853
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,400
Come on. - Karan.

854
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,280
No one will find out. Tanya, please.

855
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,560
Tanya, try to understand.

856
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,440
Nothing will happen to you.

857
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,600
Tanya. Tanya.<br>- Please, Karan. Leave me alone.

858
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,120
Tanya, listen to me.

859
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,280
You are going?

860
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,240
Without meeting me?

861
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,760
If I had met you,<br>maybe I wouldn't have been able to go.

862
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,440
So why are you going, Tanya?

863
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,800
I can't stay here.<br>Whatever happened that night..

864
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,480
For God's sake, Tanya.<br>It was an accident.

865
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,600
It was an accident. - That<br>accident has changed my life, Karan.

866
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,320
I have killed someone.

867
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,360
I am guilty.

868
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:57,800
All the time, day and night,<br>Bakshi's dread follows me.

869
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,560
You will have to forget all this.<br>You will have to forget all this.

870
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,280
That's why I am going.

871
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,520
Will you be happy without me?

872
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,360
Karan, the times we spent together..

873
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,600
..were the most beautiful<br>moments of my life.

874
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,520
But maybe I was destined<br>for a short-lived happiness.

875
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,440
You are my life, Tanya.

876
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,960
You can't take my life and go.

877
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,720
I am leaving my life behind.

878
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,200
Karan, it's very difficult<br>to leave you and go.

879
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:35,520
But whenever I look at you,<br>I remember that accident.

880
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,920
Tanya, please. Please, Tanya.

881
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,880
Please, Karan. Don't stop me.

882
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,120
Otherwise I won't be able to go.

883
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,720
If I stay..

884
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,840
..I won't be able to live.

885
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,520
Please don't go, Tanya.<br>I will become very lonely.

886
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,440
Please don't go.

887
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,320
No, Karan.<br>I will never let you be lonely.

888
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,200
Meet my son Karan.

889
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,680
And my would-be<br>daughter-in-law Natasha.

890
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,320
Cheers!

891
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,120
Hey, Karan!

892
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,440
What are you thinking?

893
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,960
Karan.

894
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,520
You really love Tashu, don't you?

895
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,920
You want to marry her, don't you?

896
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:31,600
Look, Karan. Tashu's aunt is no more.

897
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:37,920
Now it's my responsibility<br>to look after her and keep her happy.

898
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,160
More than you I am worried about her.

899
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,720
Don't worry, dad. You were right.

900
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,920
It's not necessary that<br>we always get our love.

901
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,280
And you had also said<br>that you will be happy..

902
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,600
..if you marry the one who loves you..

903
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,680
..instead of marrying<br>the one you love.

904
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Dad, Tashu is a very nice girl.<br>She is my best friend.

905
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,560
Don't worry, dad.<br>She is my responsibility.

906
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,560
Karan.

907
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,280
Dad, I will tell you in half an hour..

908
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,840
..why this model doesn't give average.

909
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,440
Mastermind,<br>there is a call for you. Here.

910
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,000
Thanks, dad.

911
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,680
Hello. Pat, how are you?

912
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,360
Where are you guys?

913
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,760
How did you remember me after so long?

914
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,520
Karan, there is bad news.

915
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,160
Dolly, who was in our college<br>gang and who was crazy for mobile..

916
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,520
What? What happened to her?

917
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,160
She is gone. She is gone.

918
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,080
She is marrying Kush.

919
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,240
You scared me. Yes.

920
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,600
Yes. But I got a call from your<br>office a few times regarding this.

921
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,840
From my office?

922
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,920
Forget that.<br>But Dolly loved you, didn't she?

923
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,440
Yes. She loved me.

924
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,640
Now she doesn't.

925
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,840
They are getting married<br>next week in Shimla.

926
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,880
I have called you to invite you.

927
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,840
From my office?

928
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,640
But my office is not here.

929
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,680
Hi, Karan. What is the matter?

930
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,880
Why are you laughing so much?

931
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,360
Karan, tell me. What happened?

932
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,640
Pat had called. - Yes.

933
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,960
To give the wedding<br>invitation. - Good.

934
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,680
Finally, he is marrying Dolly.

935
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,440
Stupid, hear the entire thing.

936
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,480
Not Pat, but Kush is marrying Dolly.

937
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,520
Kush?

938
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,080
How come?

939
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,760
Where are they getting married?

940
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,440
In Shimla.

941
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,920
Karan, we are going to Shimla,<br>aren't we?

942
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,480
We will see. If possible, we will go.

943
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,960
There is so much work here..

944
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,560
Karan, I am asking about Shimla.

945
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,480
We are going, aren't we?

946
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,800
There is a lot of work here.<br>- It wasn't our fault.

947
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,800
Tashu. - Don't I know<br>that at times you still..

948
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,160
I am talking about work. - Karan,<br>we didn't kill professor Bakshi.

949
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,480
It was just an accident.

950
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,960
After that accident we have<br>not been to Shimla even once.

951
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,760
Why, Karan? We can't live<br>our whole life in guilt and fear.

952
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,920
Let's face it, Karan.<br>Karan, let's face it.

953
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,760
It's amazing, isn't it?

954
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,800
After three years all six<br>friends are again meeting in Shimla.

955
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,960
Hi. - My friend. How are you?

956
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,720
How are you, Kush? - Hi.

957
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,000
Buddy. - Hi, Yash. - Congratulations.

958
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,040
How are you?

959
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:47,280
Oh my! I am so pleased.<br>Welcome, Karan. Welcome.

960
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,520
I thought you guys won't come.

961
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,440
Why won't we come?

962
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,440
No. The marriage is in Shimla.

963
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,720
And I have found out your secret.

964
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:57,720
What?

965
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,160
That you are so busy in Delhi.

966
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,920
At times you don't even go home.

967
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,320
How would you come to Shimla?

968
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,680
Isn't it? Isn't it?

969
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,720
We have done our entire<br>group's booking in this hotel.

970
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,240
The musical function is tonight<br>at the hotel's marriage hall.

971
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,440
Don't worry.<br>I will ensure that both of you..

972
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,560
..spend your honeymoon here.

973
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,640
Is this a hotel or a museum?

974
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:24,800
Mister, you won't find a better<br>historical hotel all over Shimla.

975
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,480
Nonsense.

976
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,760
"The bangles are shyly saying."

977
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:18,400
"Come, beloved. Bridge the chasm."

978
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,640
"Yes."

979
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,440
"It has happened.<br>It has happened. It has happened."

980
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:30,120
"I have started falling in love."

981
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,920
"I have started falling in love."

982
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,440
"I have lost it.<br>I have lost it. I have lost it."

983
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:44,360
"I have started losing my heart."

984
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,320
"I have started losing my heart."

985
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,720
"We were away for a while."

986
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,120
"Yet, my beloved."

987
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,440
"We were together all the time,<br>day and night."

988
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:16,680
"We were always together<br>in our memories."

989
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:21,160
"Our love never waned."

990
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:26,080
"We have met here and<br>two worlds have united."

991
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:31,320
"Now we will never part, beloved."

992
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,920
"Seeing you in front of me."

993
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,560
"I am in a trance."

994
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,520
"It has started waning. It has started<br>waning. It has started waning."

995
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,440
"My pain has started waning."

996
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,320
"My pain has started waning."

997
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:59,960
"I have started falling in love."

998
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,920
"I have started falling in love."

999
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,280
"I have lost it.<br>I have lost it. I have lost it."

1000
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:14,040
"I have started losing my heart."

1001
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,960
"I have started losing my heart."

1002
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,760
Where is Karan?<br>Where is Karan? - What is the matter?

1003
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,640
Where is Karan? - What happened?

1004
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,080
Come with me. - What is the matter?

1005
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:37,080
Man, I saw him. - Who?

1006
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:39,160
He is alive. - Who?

1007
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,200
Professor Bakshi.

1008
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,160
If he is alive,<br>where was he for three years? - What?

1009
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,360
I am telling you.<br>It was him. - Did you see his face?

1010
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,760
No. I didn't see his face.<br>But he was exactly like him.

1011
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,160
He saw someone like him.<br>He is confusing us needlessly.

1012
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,960
Listen, don't say this in<br>front of Tanya even mistakenly.

1013
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,600
You know all of us had<br>got separated because of this.

1014
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,400
Yes. But why will I joke about it?

1015
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,160
I know why you are doing this.

1016
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,200
You are doing this<br>to stop my marriage.

1017
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,520
Man, I will throw you out.

1018
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,840
He is kidding. Come on. Let's go.

1019
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,640
Tanya, is my veil over there? - Yes.

1020
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,880
Quick. - Here.

1021
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,760
Thank you.

1022
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,160
Natasha, are you ready?

1023
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,040
Yes. I am ready.<br>I am just applying lipstick.

1024
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,760
Which color?<br>- Light pink. Do you want it?

1025
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:21,760
Yes. Give it to me.

1026
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,680
Let me just do my touchup.<br>After that I will give you.

1027
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,960
Give it quickly. - Yes. Hold on.

1028
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,640
Natasha. - Here.

1029
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,440
I am ready.

1030
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,040
All of you get ready and come quickly.

1031
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,760
Sheetal, come soon.

1032
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,600
Oh my God! It's so cold.

1033
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,240
Hey!

1034
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,520
Karan, you scared me.

1035
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,440
Stupid. - Coward!

1036
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,320
You took so long.<br>Where are the others?

1037
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,760
They are coming. - Come.

1038
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,240
Let's go.

1039
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:24,320
I am also ready. Let's go.

1040
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,160
Payal.

1041
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,360
Sheetal.

1042
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,560
Seems like they have left.

1043
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,480
Who is there?

1044
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,160
Come on.<br>Hurry up. We are getting late.

1045
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,560
Tanya. - Yes.

1046
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,280
Come fast. - Yes.

1047
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:12,600
Tanya, what were you doing? Come on.

1048
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,160
Everyone is waiting.<br>- I was getting ready. Come on.

1049
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,840
Hi, Karan.<br>- When did you come to India?

1050
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,600
A few days ago.

1051
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,480
I thought you will surely<br>come for Kush and Dolly's marriage.

1052
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,200
I will give you a surprise there.

1053
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,400
How are you?

1054
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,120
How do I look?

1055
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,440
I am fine.

1056
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,560
Hello. Hi.

1057
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,000
No. I can't come for 6-9 movie show.

1058
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,600
I am getting married. Do one thing.<br>Get the night show ticket.

1059
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:05,480
Bye, Chandni.

1060
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,400
Hi, Natasha. - Hi, Tanya.

1061
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,200
How are you? - I am fine.

1062
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,880
Can I ask you something?

1063
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,240
Because you are Karan's best friend.

1064
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:16,440
Did Karan miss me after I left?

1065
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,400
Obviously he must have missed me.

1066
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,280
I am sure he is a<br>little angry with me.

1067
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,800
Why won't he be?<br>I left him suddenly. Isn't it?

1068
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,200
Come on. It has started.

1069
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,080
Come on.

1070
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,200
Wait! Wait! Wait! - Dolly!

1071
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,800
On me! On me! On me!

1072
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,400
Why are you jumping like a monkey?

1073
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,760
The bangles will fall on you.

1074
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,920
After all, you are getting<br>married next. - To whom?

1075
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,400
You don't know?

1076
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,000
She is engaged to Karan.

1077
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,280
Yeah!

1078
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,960
Now you also get<br>married quickly. Okay?

1079
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,160
Dolly, look after Kush.

1080
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,600
Don't worry.

1081
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,520
I will have such a nuptial<br>night which no one must have had.

1082
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,960
Wow!

1083
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,480
Is it your face or a candy?

1084
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,720
I feel like eating you in one bite.

1085
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,840
Don't remove my glasses.<br>I won't be able to see anything.

1086
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,920
You don't have to see anything.

1087
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,520
Dolly, I am scared. Go and check.

1088
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,000
Why should I check?

1089
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,920
You are 21st century wife.<br>Protect your husband.

1090
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,600
Look, we will do one thing.<br>We will check together. Okay?

1091
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,080
Come on.

1092
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,400
Who?

1093
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,640
Dolly!

1094
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,320
Yash, you?

1095
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,640
Are you crazy?

1096
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,680
She only said she will<br>have such a nuptial night..

1097
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,240
..which no one must have had.

1098
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:56,720
So I thought I will play such<br>a prank that no one must have played.

1099
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:58,680
Mister.

1100
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,560
Do you think you have<br>inherited my antique coat..

1101
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,120
..from your father<br>that you have worn it?

1102
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,520
Come on. Remove it.

1103
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,760
It's time for decent people to sleep.

1104
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:10,080
Such commotion doesn't look good.

1105
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:13,800
Yes. - Saying yes. Mischief-maker.

1106
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:16,240
Yash. - Don't play this prank again.

1107
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,840
These people are..

1108
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,800
There were three coats.<br>Now there are only two.

1109
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,480
Where did the third one go?

1110
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,840
I will see.

1111
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,080
Tanya.

1112
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,160
Tanya.

1113
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,520
What are you doing here?

1114
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:54,920
Tanya, I tried very hard<br>to find you and contact you.

1115
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,560
But.. - No, Karan.

1116
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,080
It was my fault.

1117
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,480
After the shock of that<br>accident I went far away.

1118
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,960
I thought I will come for<br>the marriage and give you a surprise.

1119
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,160
But here, you gave me a surprise.

1120
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,800
It was Dolly's wish that we friends..

1121
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,440
..should spend a few days together.

1122
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,840
It's good you stayed<br>back for her sake.

1123
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,320
But Karan, I have realized one thing.

1124
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,280
Wishes never come true.

1125
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,920
Got married in penury. This is what<br>should happen with him. - Pat. Pat.

1126
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,760
Natasha, give me money.<br>He gave me only Rs.10.

1127
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:36,920
I want to drink beer.<br>- Did you see Karan?

1128
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,320
He left early morning<br>as soon as he woke up.

1129
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,840
He has come. My buddy.

1130
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,440
Give me money for beer. Be quick.

1131
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,880
Give me. - Karan,<br>where were you since morning?

1132
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,280
I had gone to the college.<br>To refresh old memories.

1133
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,120
From there I went to Uncle Sam.

1134
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,600
You should have told me.<br>I would have also come.

1135
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,400
You were sleeping soundly.

1136
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,200
Karan. Karan, help me get up.

1137
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,520
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1138
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,680
Where were you?

1139
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,520
You had gone for half an hour.

1140
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,640
Check your watch. What's the time?

1141
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,760
I had gone to Uncle Sam's coffee shop.

1142
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,440
I didn't realize how<br>time passed with Karan.

1143
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:18,120
Oh! Karan.

1144
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:23,920
There.

1145
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,960
"Pitter-patter."

1146
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,000
"A boy is splashing water."

1147
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,960
"He has been seen somewhere."

1148
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:41,680
Let's go to hotel. - You..

1149
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:49,320
Karan! Karan!

1150
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,640
What happned? - Karan! Karan!

1151
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,800
Professor Bakshi.

1152
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,880
In the toilet.<br>He tried to kill me with a knife.

1153
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,880
He must be there.<br>Come with me quickly.

1154
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,720
Karan! Karan, come with me!

1155
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,120
Yash. Yash, come and see.

1156
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:07,320
Look. From this door.

1157
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,920
He thrust the knife from this door.

1158
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,400
I was standing here.<br>I was facing this side.

1159
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,040
I hit the wall. The beer fell down.

1160
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,280
And.. - He is kidding.

1161
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,800
Come on. Let's go. - Are you crazy?<br>Don't take it lightly.

1162
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,480
He must be here. Karan, listen to me.

1163
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:22,600
There is no one here.<br>- Karan. Karan, listen to me.

1164
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:24,920
Karan, Pat can be wrong once.<br>But not again and again.

1165
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,160
Listen. - When he is saying<br>he saw professor Bakshi..

1166
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,320
..then we should go<br>to his house and check.

1167
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,560
Are you crazy? What is the<br>need to go to his house? - Alright.

1168
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,960
No. - Let's check.

1169
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,480
At least we will get rid of this fear.

1170
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:38,400
What is the need to go to his house?<br>- Come on. Let's go.

1171
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,880
Karan, whistle if anything happens.

1172
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,240
Let's go, Yash. There is no one here.

1173
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,320
Don't listen to him.<br>He has gone crazy.

1174
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,680
He sees Bakshi all the time.<br>Seems like because of the ice..

1175
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,160
Found you.

1176
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,920
Where were you? Where were you?

1177
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,040
Do you know us?

1178
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:49,760
So what if I don't know all of you?

1179
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,240
I will gradually know you.

1180
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,840
Yes. But we don't know you.

1181
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,400
Look, wrestler.<br>Hold this. Shove the ice.

1182
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,520
Otherwise you will be inside.

1183
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,080
Not that. If you don't shove the ice,<br>how will you go ahead?

1184
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:09,480
"Someone is missing."

1185
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:14,240
"Someone is slandered."

1186
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,160
Let's leave. Come on. Move fast.

1187
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,360
Come on. Come on. Move fast.

1188
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,760
Tashu, sit quickly.

1189
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,760
Hey! Hey!

1190
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,960
Where are you running?

1191
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,920
Mister. - Popatlal.

1192
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,960
As such, parrots are green.<br>But this parrot is red.

1193
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:42,800
Whoever you are,<br>why are you following us?

1194
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,800
Why did you follow us to the hotel?

1195
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,880
Amazing!

1196
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,280
It's my car.<br>It's my petrol. It's my wish.

1197
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,080
Whether I go to a<br>haunted house and dance..

1198
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,120
..what is your problem?

1199
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,200
We don't have any problem.

1200
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,400
You can go to a haunted house.

1201
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,720
I have come to a haunted house.

1202
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,800
So what if I am not<br>the owner of this hotel?

1203
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,240
I am the manager.

1204
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:07,320
So what if he looks<br>like a clerk of this hotel?

1205
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,720
He is the owner.<br>I have told him so many times.

1206
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:10,720
To wear suitable clothes.

1207
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,040
What is this, Popat? Blabbering away.

1208
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,600
Sorry for the inconvenience.

1209
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:18,600
The hotel staff is on a leave.<br>So there was some problem.

1210
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,800
Popat has come.<br>He will manage everything.

1211
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,560
Goodnight. - Goodnight.

1212
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:29,640
What are you thinking, Tanya?<br>- Nothing. Pat scared us.

1213
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,240
Three years have passed. But..

1214
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,400
Karan, are you sure professor<br>Bakshi was not there?

1215
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,560
He wasn't there, Tanya.

1216
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:39,520
Anyway, we are leaving tomorrow.

1217
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,680
I will miss you all.

1218
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:46,720
When are you getting married?

1219
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,080
The date has not been fixed.

1220
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,640
Will you invite me for your wedding?

1221
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,880
Will you come?

1222
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,000
No.

1223
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,680
Goodnight.

1224
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,600
Tashu. - Karan.

1225
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,440
Karan. - Tashu. What happened, Tashu?

1226
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,440
Karan..when I was alone in the room..

1227
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,280
..someone came from behind me.

1228
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,600
I ran away in fright.

1229
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,920
I screamed loudly. - What happened?

1230
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,200
I am scared, Karan. - What happened?

1231
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,360
I am very scared.<br>- Who was he? - What happened?

1232
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,200
I didn't see clearly. - What happened?

1233
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,360
What happened, Natasha?

1234
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,760
But I think it was professor Bakshi.

1235
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,080
What happened?<br>Why is Natasha so scared.. - Yash.

1236
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,400
Stop your prank of scaring us.

1237
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,640
Come on.<br>I didn't scare anyone this time.

1238
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,720
Who could it be?

1239
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,400
So who could it be?

1240
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,840
Hold on. I will go and check.

1241
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,000
What happened? - No one is there.

1242
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,480
Tashu, no one is there.

1243
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:45,680
It's only your delusion.<br>Please stop fearing the professor.

1244
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:50,880
Natasha, if you are scared,<br>you can come and sleep in my room.

1245
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,520
Yes. Now we will have our<br>nuptial night after we return home.

1246
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,280
No. There is no need for that.<br>Natasha, you can sleep in my room.

1247
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:00,840
No, Tanya. It's okay. I am fine.

1248
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,160
Come. I will be with you. - Come on.

1249
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,520
Yash wasn't there.

1250
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,320
It's so cold.<br>They don't even let me sleep.

1251
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,440
Hello. Hello.

1252
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:23,680
All the managers<br>on this route are busy.

1253
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:29,560
Please don't call after some time.<br>- Hello. Hello.

1254
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:31,600
I won't be afraid. I won't be afraid.

1255
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,200
Why don't they believe me?

1256
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:35,640
Since when I am..

1257
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,880
Tashu, relax.<br>There is no need to be afraid.

1258
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,920
Nothing will happen.

1259
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,600
The professor is not alive.

1260
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,560
It's only your delusion. You trust me?

1261
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,440
You allayed this fear.

1262
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,120
Which other fear do you have?

1263
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:06,040
Karan, you will never leave me,<br>will you?

1264
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:08,840
You won't leave me, will you?

1265
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:16,800
I love you the most in the world.

1266
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:20,840
If you leave me, I will be all alone.

1267
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,720
If you are there, I have everything.

1268
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,880
If you are not there,<br>there is nothing.

1269
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,880
This is what you are afraid of?

1270
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:40,840
When two people are close,<br>not they, but their heartbeats speak.

1271
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,720
And heartbeats never lie.

1272
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:53,400
"In my eyes, sleep and dreams."

1273
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:59,480
"I see only you, beloved."

1274
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:04,040
"In my memories and thoughts."

1275
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,840
"Only you are there."

1276
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,440
"I swear by you."

1277
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:14,800
"You are in my breaths."

1278
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:20,840
"Without you life is meaningless,<br>beloved."

1279
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:25,680
"I am afraid.<br>I am afraid all the time."

1280
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:31,840
"That you will leave me."

1281
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:43,040
"My heartbeats ask you."

1282
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:56,200
"Will you love me?"

1283
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,320
"Me."

1284
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,960
Hello. Yes, Tanya. Tell me.

1285
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,400
Yes. I will come right away.

1286
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,080
Tanya wants to talk to me.

1287
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,800
Karan.

1288
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,040
You said you will<br>never leave me and go.

1289
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,120
Go.

1290
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,080
Tanya.

1291
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,200
At this hour? You had some work?

1292
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:42,120
I want to return<br>something to you. - What?

1293
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,760
Along with relations,<br>this thread has also become weak.

1294
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,160
Before it breaks, take it back.

1295
01:33:55,240 --> 01:34:00,640
Please. And as it is,<br>now Natasha has a right..

1296
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,240
..on everything that is yours.

1297
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,560
Tanya, when two people<br>are bound in a relation..

1298
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:11,640
..is it necessary that<br>they maintain only that relation?

1299
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,000
Relations can also change.

1300
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Maybe we couldn't maintain the<br>relation we shared in the beginning.

1301
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,760
But we can be friends. Right?

1302
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:28,880
Goodnight.

1303
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,480
Karan.

1304
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,760
What's the date? - Of what?

1305
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,320
Your marriage. - Why?

1306
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,240
I will come.

1307
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:49,480
"You don't know."

1308
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:55,760
"How much I loved you!"

1309
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:06,240
"I had unknowingly,<br>secretly asked you in my prayer."

1310
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:17,160
"It's God's will that<br>I didn't get you, beloved."

1311
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:21,680
"Leave it. Forget it."

1312
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:28,120
"I don't have any grievance from you."

1313
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:39,280
"Love is asking you."

1314
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:52,000
"Will you love me?"

1315
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,440
"Me."

1316
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:02,680
"Lock eyes sometimes."

1317
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:07,480
"At times come near."

1318
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,360
Popat, why did you light<br>incense and spread smoke?

1319
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:12,040
May you rot!

1320
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:16,480
Sir, this incense spreads<br>fragrance in this stinking hotel.

1321
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,560
It gives peace to your father's soul.

1322
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:21,240
And it wards off evil spirits.<br>- Which evil spirit?

1323
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:23,720
Who? On one hand you.

1324
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,600
On the other hand your father.

1325
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,040
He was such a nice man.

1326
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:28,960
I am still here because of him. - Yes.

1327
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,760
You are still here.<br>And you sent him to heaven.

1328
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,840
Wretched unlucky man!

1329
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,160
As soon as you came my father died.

1330
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:35,160
Because of me? - Yes.

1331
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,280
I am wretched? - Yes.

1332
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:37,480
Unlucky? - Yes.

1333
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:38,960
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

1334
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,080
I will answer the<br>phone and then see you.

1335
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:42,320
Calling me unlucky. - Hello.

1336
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,240
Hello. - Father.

1337
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,720
Yes, sir. Two minutes, sir.<br>- Grant him some sense.

1338
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,040
Popat, in room number 609,<br>one chicken sandwich..

1339
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:52,000
..one vegetable sandwich<br>and one bottle of water.

1340
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,040
Send it. - You take it. Go.

1341
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,080
I won't enter the kitchen.

1342
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,800
Why? - You can hear<br>weird sounds over there.

1343
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,360
Your father died in the kitchen.

1344
01:36:58,440 --> 01:36:59,960
Why should I enter the kitchen?<br>Order it from out.

1345
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:00,840
You send me into the<br>kitchen again and again.

1346
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:01,960
Why should I go?

1347
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:03,680
Fine. I will go this time.<br>But not again.

1348
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,120
Yes. In the kitchen.

1349
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,200
I will have to do something.

1350
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,800
Wretched man.

1351
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,160
Help!

1352
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:38,240
Help! Help!

1353
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:44,240
Karan. - Are you okay?

1354
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,880
No, Karan. - Are you okay?

1355
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,520
Come on.

1356
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,840
Fire. Fire.

1357
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,160
Where is the fire?

1358
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:55,960
Where? So what if I haven't<br>worked in the fire brigade?

1359
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,280
I can at least dowse the fire.

1360
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,840
Where is the fire? - There is no fire.

1361
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:00,200
The steam bath's<br>temperature had gone up.

1362
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,040
Karan, you are hurt.

1363
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,800
I will get first-aid from the room.<br>- Oh, God!

1364
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:04,880
What kind of hotel is this?

1365
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,280
The steam bath's temperature<br>rises on its own.

1366
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,840
The door gets locked. - Look, mister.

1367
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,880
Firstly, the steam bath's door<br>doesn't get locked from the outside.

1368
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,600
It must have got jammed<br>from the inside. So it got locked.

1369
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:15,320
Secondly, the temperature<br>doesn't rise on its own.

1370
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,720
Ma'am must have increased it.

1371
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,840
Is she mad? - No. I am mad. I am mad.

1372
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,000
I am roaming around with the pipe.

1373
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:22,560
Am I a fire brigade officer?

1374
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:26,320
What is this? - Medicine.

1375
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,600
It's not bomb, is it?

1376
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,560
Here. Apply first-aid.

1377
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:34,760
Yash, I don't understand.<br>What is happening?

1378
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,720
Give me, Tanya. I will apply it.

1379
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:52,360
Where are you guys going<br>all dressed up in the morning?

1380
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:55,920
Back to Delhi. - You guys can't go.

1381
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,160
It's not like that.<br>Where will you go? See the main road.

1382
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:04,760
It's covered with snow.<br>And your car has frozen.

1383
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,480
There is no bus, train or airplane.<br>How will you go?

1384
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:10,480
Popatlal, do something.

1385
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,000
It's very important<br>for us to go to Delhi.

1386
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,920
Yes. Do one thing.

1387
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,520
Go by the backdoor.

1388
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,640
Yes. - Thanks.

1389
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:18,120
I would have said that.

1390
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:19,800
If there had been a backdoor.

1391
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:25,680
Do one thing. There is a<br>20 feet well behind our storeroom.

1392
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:28,080
Get into that.<br>It connects to a tunnel.

1393
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,320
Does the tunnel go to Delhi?

1394
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,800
No. To Kargil.

1395
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:33,240
Popatlal, don't joke.

1396
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,600
We have to go to Delhi at any cost.<br>Do something.

1397
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:39,040
What do I do?<br>Will I drop everyone to Delhi?

1398
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:40,480
Do one thing. - Yes.

1399
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,120
Connect me to Delhi.

1400
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,880
Okay. But in such a<br>season telephone lines..

1401
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,840
..are disrupted first of all.

1402
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,120
All our phones are dead.

1403
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,640
Now? - Pat was smart.

1404
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,120
He left at night.

1405
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,440
Nothing happened.

1406
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,200
My limbs are aching<br>from playing since morning.

1407
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:02,120
Tanya, tell me something. - What?

1408
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,720
Don't worry. It's not personal.

1409
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,800
You and Karan were madly in love.

1410
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,760
How did the relation end?

1411
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,960
And now Natasha and<br>Karan are getting married.

1412
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,840
Don't you feel bad?

1413
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:19,720
Let's not discuss that.

1414
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:23,240
It means you still love Karan.

1415
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,640
I am bored of being stuck here.

1416
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:26,280
Wonder when the ice will melt.

1417
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,320
Here. Drink.

1418
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,920
I am also very bored.

1419
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,120
I will just come. Take care, man.

1420
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,920
What happened to the power?

1421
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,200
Oh God! The power<br>also had to go now only.

1422
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,680
Dolly, please search for a candle.

1423
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:45,640
Wow! What a blackout!

1424
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:55,280
Do you know? What would I have done..

1425
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:59,520
..if my life partner<br>had been with me? - What?

1426
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,960
Karan. Karan, did professor<br>Bakshi switch off the power?

1427
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,600
He can do anything.

1428
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:14,200
Tanya, what are you doing here?

1429
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,200
I..I came to look for a candle.

1430
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,160
Popatlal,<br>is this a hotel or a haunted house?

1431
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,400
It's not a haunted house.

1432
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,240
Come on.<br>Go to your rooms and take rest.

1433
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,200
Yes. As it is,<br>it's very late at night.

1434
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:31,800
Goodnight. Come on.

1435
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:36,040
Dolly. Dolly.

1436
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:38,360
Seems like she went to her room.

1437
01:42:58,640 --> 01:42:59,520
What happened, Kush?

1438
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,640
Karan. Karan,<br>Dolly is not in the room.

1439
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:04,240
Sonny, why do you cry?<br>She must be around. What else?

1440
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:06,600
She must be in Tashu<br>or Tanya's room. - No.

1441
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:08,000
Let's see. - Come on.

1442
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,040
Tanya, is Dolly in your room?

1443
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:14,120
I don't know.<br>She was in my room just now.

1444
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,040
But when the power<br>came back and I returned..

1445
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:17,160
..she wasn't there.

1446
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:18,880
Maybe she is in her room.

1447
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,440
She is not there. She is nowhere.

1448
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,600
I am telling you. - Relax.

1449
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:23,200
Don't worry. She must be around.

1450
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,440
She must be wandering around<br>to catch mobile's signal. What else?

1451
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,600
Yash, let's look for her.<br>- Come on. - Okay?

1452
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,800
I will also come. - Come on.

1453
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:36,600
Dolly. Dolly.

1454
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:44,960
Dolly.

1455
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:54,560
Popatlal!

1456
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:09,920
Pick it up. Pick it up. - Hey!

1457
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,200
I thought.. - I am dead.

1458
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,120
As such, I am as good as dead.

1459
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:17,200
I am wandering around like a zombie.

1460
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,520
Working in such a hotel<br>is like risking your life.

1461
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,200
Have you come here to build your body?

1462
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,640
No. We can't find Dolly,<br>a girl from our group.

1463
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,720
Who? That mobile girl?<br>- Yes. Did you see her?

1464
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,360
I saw her.<br>She must be around. Let's look around.

1465
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:34,720
I want riddance from such<br>a hotel and such customers.

1466
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,680
They are going missing from the hotel.

1467
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,520
Oh God!

1468
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:43,160
Who is standing at the window?<br>Hello, ma'am.

1469
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,320
Shall I bring tea or water?

1470
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:49,600
Sorry. I disturbed you. Okay.

1471
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,200
Is your name Dolly?

1472
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,760
Maybe her tongue<br>has frozen in the cold.

1473
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,960
Is she standing here<br>to click her photo?

1474
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,200
There is no photographer too.

1475
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:06,680
Goodnight, ma'am.<br>Sorry for the trouble.

1476
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:08,120
Enjoy your stay.

1477
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,960
Dolly.

1478
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,360
Dolly.

1479
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,040
Dolly.

1480
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:27,560
Oh God!

1481
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:29,920
Yash! Yash!

1482
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:33,200
Oh no! Yash! Yash!

1483
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,760
Hey!

1484
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:57,600
Bakshi, why did you kill Pat?

1485
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:00,600
Not only Pat,<br>I want to kill all of you.

1486
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,680
When you guys tried to kill me..

1487
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,680
..I would have killed you right then.

1488
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:08,920
But I wanted to kill Tanya.

1489
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,520
And she escaped because of you, Karan.

1490
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:11,880
Because of you.

1491
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:16,360
I loved my wife a lot.

1492
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,880
But she thought I am mad.

1493
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:20,960
She wanted to leave me and go.

1494
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:25,480
But I killed her and kept her at home.

1495
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:28,440
Because of you guys the<br>police found my wife's body.

1496
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:30,200
And she went away from me.

1497
01:46:30,280 --> 01:46:32,600
Because of you guys<br>the police were after me.

1498
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,280
I went into hiding for three years.

1499
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,760
When I came back, I got to know..

1500
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,480
..that you guys have left from Shimla.

1501
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:42,080
Then I found out that Dolly<br>and Kush are getting married.

1502
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,600
I was sure you guys<br>will come for the marriage.

1503
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:47,880
I even called you<br>up anonymously, Karan.

1504
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:56,360
You killed Dolly too.<br>- I also wanted to kill Dolly.

1505
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:58,320
But someone killed her before me.

1506
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,120
You are lying. - Why will I lie?

1507
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:13,640
I am here, in front of you.

1508
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,320
So who is that person?

1509
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:23,920
Karan.

1510
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:25,720
Kush. - Karan.

1511
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,080
Kush. - Karan.

1512
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,840
Tanya. Tanya. - Tanya.

1513
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,040
Karan, the road has opened.

1514
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:33,960
Tanya left in a car<br>with Natasha just now.

1515
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,960
It means Tanya will kill Tashu too..

1516
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:37,800
Oh God!

1517
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:39,600
Is it his turn now?

1518
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,760
Tashu! Tashu!

1519
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:04,000
Karan! Karan!

1520
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:05,480
Karan!

1521
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,040
Karan! - Tashu!

1522
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:10,160
Karan, thank God you came. - Tashu!

1523
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:11,720
Thank God you came. - Tashu!

1524
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,320
Good you came, Karan.<br>Do you know, Karan?

1525
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,200
After you left,<br>professor Bakshi came in the hotel.

1526
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:22,800
First he killed Kush.

1527
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:25,880
And then he killed Yash too.

1528
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:31,920
And then he brought<br>Tanya and me here in a car.

1529
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:33,840
Are you sure it was professor Bakshi?

1530
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,480
Yes, Karan. It was professor Bakshi.

1531
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:39,160
But Tashu,<br>professor Bakshi was with me.

1532
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:43,640
Well..

1533
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:45,360
Karan..

1534
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,480
Tanya!

1535
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,720
Tanya! Tanya!

1536
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,400
Tanya!

1537
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:00,000
Why, Tashu? Why?

1538
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:02,840
Why did you do this? Why?

1539
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:05,440
Why did you do this?<br>- Because I love you, Karan.

1540
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,360
I love you, Karan. I love you, Karan.

1541
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:11,080
Because I love you.<br>Because I love you.

1542
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:16,600
I love you, Karan. I really love you.

1543
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,640
And you..you lied to me.

1544
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:23,280
You went to Uncle Sam to meet Tanya.

1545
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:30,640
When Pat told us that<br>he has seen professor Bakshi..

1546
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,440
..I took advantage of that.

1547
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:37,560
Dolly.

1548
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:41,080
Poor Dolly became a<br>victim due to the darkness.

1549
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:47,400
Karan, I promise.<br>I had gone to kill Tanya.

1550
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:52,560
And Kush..Kush saw me.

1551
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:54,880
So I killed him too.

1552
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,160
'Natasha, you? Tanya, run.'

1553
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:00,800
Karan, I am sorry.

1554
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:06,040
Karan, you will forgive me, won't you?

1555
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:11,360
Please, Karan.<br>You will marry me, won't you?

1556
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:15,720
You won't marry me, will you?

1557
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,480
No.

1558
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,840
You won't marry me, will you?

1559
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:24,800
Karan, you never loved me.

1560
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:28,640
You only lend me your support, Karan.

1561
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:32,360
Karan, you are my life.

1562
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:38,320
If you are not in my life,<br>what is the use of living?

1563
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,520
Tashu, stop. Tashu, please stop.

1564
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,640
Tashu, stop.

1565
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,920
I love you.

1566
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,200
Tashu, stop.

1567
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,160
I love you. - Tashu.

1568
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:48,720
Karan!

1569
01:50:48,920 --> 01:50:50,280
Tashu!

1570
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:54,000
Karan! Karan!

1571
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,520
Tashu!

1572
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,560
Tashu!

1573
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:09,840
Karan! Karan, stop! Listen to me.

1574
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,080
Stop!

1575
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:17,400
Students,<br>today is the first day of college.

1576
01:51:17,560 --> 01:51:20,400
Along with the present students..

1577
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:22,440
..we will remember<br>those students too..

1578
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,680
..who are no longer with us.

1579
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,040
Let's pray for them.

1580
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:28,200
'I can even lay down my life for you.'

1581
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,880
'Oh yeah!'

1582
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:36,640
'Life is unpredictable. Anything<br>can happen anytime. Isn't it?'

1583
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,480
'Kush, do something in life.'

1584
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,080
'Otherwise you will<br>regret all your life.'

1585
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:43,880
'Karan, explain to him.'

1586
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:57,560
'Karan, you will never<br>leave me and go, will you?'

1587
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,720
'I love you the most in the world.'

1588
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:06,760
'If you are there, I have everything.'

1589
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,480
'If you are not there,<br>there is nothing.'

1590
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:14,440
Why? Why?

1591
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:17,720
Stupid..

1592
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,200
Let's go. It's time for the flight.

1593
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:32,720
The police took my statement<br>and they have arrested Bakshi.

1594
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,640
Come on.

1595
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:03,360
Karan.

1596
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:10,440
I am sorry.<br>Because of me all this.. - No, Tanya.

1597
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:13,000
It wasn't your fault.

1598
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:20,320
What will you do now?

1599
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:24,960
The routine stuff.<br>Delhi. My work and me.

1600
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:29,720
What if..

1601
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:34,200
..someone wants to support you?

1602
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:40,040
My name is Yash.<br>When I was a kid, we were very poor.

1603
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:42,760
And my papa used to dance in<br>a beer bar. - I am sorry. I am sorry.

1604
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:45,080
You know, beer bar. - Are you okay?

1605
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:55,880
"Your laughter is like<br>flowers blossoming in spring."

1606
01:53:56,120 --> 01:54:06,880
"I find you a little naughty."

1607
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:11,400
"I was besotted with<br>you right from the beginning."

1608
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:17,760
"I was afraid to say this saga."

1609
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:22,280
"In my eyes, sleep and dreams."

1610
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:28,920
"I see only you, beloved."

1611
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:39,760
"My heartbeats ask you."

1612
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:51,840
"Will you love me?"

1613
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:58,680
"Yes. Me."
