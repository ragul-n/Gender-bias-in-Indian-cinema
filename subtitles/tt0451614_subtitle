1
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,212
Say what you want, but our
stars are connected.

2
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,008
- All the schemes we've thought of...
- All were sucessful.

3
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:56,968
Do you know why?

4
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:03,892
Because when I think of a scheme
I think of kissing success.

5
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,398
Again? Are you ever satisfied?

6
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,360
Has anyone ever been satisfied with success?

7
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,613
And I always want to be on...

8
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,619
So that I can get the world's wealth in
my pocket as soon as possible.

9
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,330
What will you do with so much money?

10
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,791
I'll buy all the happiness.

11
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:35,340
And then I'll hug my success and
live in it's arms forever.

12
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:40,303
Oh, stop. Did you speak to Rekha
in the same tone?

13
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,263
Rekha?

14
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,893
That was a dream...

15
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,854
A day dream...

16
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,444
Almost 5 years before today.

17
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,741
I was running away from the police.

18
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,958
He was right here, where did he go?
Look for him everywhere!

19
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,006
My life is in danger, some
goons are looking for me.

20
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,929
I should go!

21
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:23,073
Rekha, your empathy saved me from the enemies.

22
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:29,496
Your care has lead me to heal quickly.

23
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,627
And in these few days, you
have taken over my heart.

24
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,215
So much that even if I want to go...

25
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,759
You will leave?

26
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:49,224
No, I can't leave you,
I could never leave you.

27
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,520
A few days later we got married too.

28
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,440
And the night I got to know,
I'm going to be a father..

29
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,358
That night...

30
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,530
- Who is it?
- Police!

31
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,744
I stopped to think if I should leave or no?

32
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,040
And without a second thought I left Rekha.

33
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,711
That was the last time I saw Rekha.

34
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:18,878
Why?

35
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,714
You didn't meet her again?

36
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,341
I did go back.

37
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,847
But I got to know, she left the
house and shifted.

38
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,767
I looked everywhere, but,...
- But?

39
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,437
I found you...

40
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,779
Get up, child.

41
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:51,327
My mom's medicine fell down.
She is very ill!

42
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:55,165
I don't even have money for more medicine.

43
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,624
Jack?

44
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,420
Yes, Sir?

45
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,006
Give it to the child, and let's go!

46
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:03,882
Okay, Sir.

47
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,677
Here you go, child. Buy new medicine.

48
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,979
Maa, I got the medicne.
I got all the medicines.

49
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,985
Good boy... You returned before I left.

50
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,445
Where are you going, Maa?

51
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:31,409
Very far, son, a place from
where no one returns.

52
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,287
Waht about me? I'll be all alone.

53
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,038
Son!

54
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,796
Son, get me that.

55
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,508
That photo of God?

56
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,236
Maa, who's photo is this?

57
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,073
Your father.

58
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,117
My father?

59
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:20,083
Maa? Maaa? Wake up, Maa? Open your eyes!

60
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,545
Maa? Maa?

61
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,928
The Government has stopped Rs. 1000 notes.

62
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,641
These notes as as good as waste paper.

63
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,855
This government policy has put us
in a loss of 20 million rupees.

64
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,649
How will we cover the loss, Sir?

65
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,110
It's going to take 2 years to save 20 million.

66
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,780
For others, for Johnny, it's just 2 days.

67
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,949
Have you thought of some scheme?

68
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,037
Rita, Johnny never talks without thinking.

69
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,831
There is news.

70
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:08,173
2 days later, the treasure of Hamaliya Estate's
King, is coming to Bombay for an auction.

71
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,718
But we will rob it before it reaches Bombay.

72
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,596
How? There will be a lot
of security, won't there?

73
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,891
And to face the police out in
the open is impossible.

74
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,395
Nothing is impossible for Johnny.

75
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,815
Johnny does exactly what he thinks of.

76
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:53,917
Even after our Police department
and the State for help..

77
00:13:54,376 --> 00:14:00,715
..we still don't know the murderer of gaurds
and the robber of the treasure.

78
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:07,389
We should be ashamed that when this was asked
in the assembly, we didn't have an answer.

79
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:12,811
But, Sir? I'd like to yet again look
at the confidencial file.

80
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,939
The one with the famous singer
and dancer, Johnny.

81
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,943
Just by writing a name in a file,
you can't accuse an innocent man.

82
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,904
You can doubt me too.

83
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,115
But you definitely need proof.

84
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,411
Has any officer ever found
any proof on Jhonny?

85
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,872
And Johnny is a rich and famous man.

86
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,749
Why will he do something like this?

87
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,628
It could be possible that his songs
and dance are a facade.

88
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,213
And the reality could be entirely different.

89
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,883
But this arguement still doesn't give
us the proof we require.

90
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,927
Anyway...

91
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,640
I have called you here to give you'll
very important information.

92
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:56,104
To handle this case, a CBI officer from the
Central government will be coming.

93
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,900
And it will be your duty to help them.

94
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,988
His name is Mr. Aslam Khan.

95
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,491
May I come in?

96
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,744
Yes, CBI officer, Mr. Khan?

97
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,455
Please come, I was waiting for you.

98
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,208
I've heard you left behind the city of the
Rajdhani and are here in Bombay now?

99
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:23,465
What's Delhi, people come from all over
India to meet the famous Johnny

100
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,592
It's a pleasure to meet you.

101
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,510
I have heard a lot about you.

102
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,929
A name is made from the work you do, Johnny.

103
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,223
Anyway, why have you called me here?

104
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:39,397
What's in the reasons, just think of it
as an excuse to meet you.

105
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,775
Cheers to this pleasant evening.

106
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:46,363
No, thank you. I want to take the
pleasures of this meeting.

107
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,947
As you wish.

108
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,160
Also, I've heard that you have come to look
for a very dangerous criminal, in Bombay.

109
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,829
That has always got away from you.

110
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,831
He doesn't have a lot of time.

111
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:02,003
But to be honest, it's the wish to see you
live on stage that got me here.

112
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:08,093
I'm an open book, Sir. They watch, or read.

113
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,387
And the smart ones understand.

114
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:16,601
You're right. Mr. Khan, next Sunday,
my troop is doing a show.

115
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,479
I request you to be the Chief Guest
of this show.

116
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,024
This show is for the Relief Fund for
widowed Policer officer wives.

117
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,527
It's a good deed, don't say no.

118
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:34,077
Only on the condition, that when I
call you, you will not refuse.

119
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,372
- Sure.
- Promise?

120
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:38,498
Promise.

121
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,130
Today's programm will have this music.

122
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:51,678
And in the last part, after the 4 beats of
the drum, here's 2 bangs of the cymbol.

123
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,014
- Cymbol's... Right.
- 2 bangs.

124
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,684
And you have to shoot at the second bang.

125
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,146
So that the noise of the bullet is
drowned by the music.

126
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:02,522
Okay, Sir.

127
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:09,487
And, you should know, that Johnny thinks
every opportunity is the last opportunity.

128
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,115
Gurnam knows his work well, Sir.

129
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,869
The bullet will directly go throug
the CBI officer's head.

130
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,164
Listen to this once more.

131
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,498
Thank God, Mr. Khan.
The bullet just missed you.

132
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:39,377
Yes, I got saved. We could say
that your bullet saved me.

133
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:43,548
No, no one has been able to dodge my bullet.

134
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:47,510
See, that's the dead body.

135
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,972
But my bullets are reserved for the enemy.

136
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,017
You have a very good understanding
of friends and foes.

137
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,310
Thank you.

138
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,979
This revolver?

139
00:23:58,855 --> 00:23:59,522
I have a liscence.

140
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:03,234
Naturally. That's why you have it
with you, even on the stage.

141
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,029
Do you also have threats from enemies?

142
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,241
Don't worry. You are now a friend.

143
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,452
It's my responsibility to protect you.

144
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:13,995
Thank you.

145
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,039
Send the body for postmortem.

146
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,123
Okay, Sir.

147
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:20,960
The chap lost his life.

148
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:27,592
But whoever is behind all of this,
I'll get him soon!

149
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:35,392
By the way, your game... I mean
your show was very nice.

150
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,394
Thank you.

151
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,187
Good night.

152
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:48,738
If not Johny's bullet, Gurnam would have
been killed by the police.

153
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:53,785
And if he'd get arrested, then we
all would be in danger.

154
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,208
I'm saddened by Gurnam's death, but
such a mistake can't be forgiven.

155
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:09,009
Anyway, today the International
Organisation's Chief, Supremo, is in Bombay.

156
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,636
I have an appointment with him.

157
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:18,852
If we get a chance to work with Supremo,
we'll have a profit of millions.

158
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,146
- Good luck, Johny.
- Thank you.

159
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:23,064
- Good luck, Sir.
- Thank you.

160
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,188
Good morning, Supremo.

161
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,526
Tell me, what can I do for you?

162
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:56,116
Johny, after a background check on you,
the Supremo has decided,..

163
00:26:56,449 --> 00:27:01,204
..if you want, you can be the Indian agent
for our International Organisation.

164
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,207
I am honored.

165
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,168
But this is unfair to me, Supremo.

166
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:11,589
- I have worked so long for the organisation..
- That was your second mistake.

167
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,343
And Supremo never forgives 2 mistakes.

168
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,611
So you agree to my offer?

169
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:35,488
Yes, Supremo.

170
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:40,118
Good. Today onwards, you belong
to our organisation.

171
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:41,828
Thank you.

172
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,584
Every agent needs to morgage gold worth
10 million with the organisation.

173
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,878
When can you give it?

174
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:51,379
I'll have it ready by tomorrow.

175
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:55,008
Not tomorrow. You will recieve a
message in a few days.

176
00:27:55,967 --> 00:28:02,140
The Organisation will give you 10% commision
and expenditure for your manpower.

177
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,393
Thank you.

178
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:11,608
Remember one thing, the punishment for
mistakes is...

179
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:33,505
Honesty in business and intelligence in work,
could make you Supremo, one day.

180
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:34,798
Thank you.

181
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,012
Johny! The door is this way.

182
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:49,145
Johny never goes back on the
same road he came from.

183
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:22,512
I'm sorry...

184
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:24,431
- Mr. Khan?
- Hello.

185
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,599
You, here? Everything okay?

186
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,145
Don't worry, Johny,
I still don't need a coffin.

187
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:34,065
Right, you bother more about
other people's coffins.

188
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,401
Onlyt of criminals.

189
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,654
And I'm quite infamous for it too.

190
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,824
Often instead of going through an arrest..

191
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:47,871
..prefer to lie in a coffin and
sleep forever.

192
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:50,749
They must be really lucky.

193
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,043
- I just can't fall asleep.
- Really?

194
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,085
Yeah...

195
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:55,712
You will be able to.

196
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,797
Stop running around.

197
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:03,928
I want to, Mr. Khan. But can't help it,
people like you can't stop following me.

198
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,433
And you know, I have to take care of
others more than myself.

199
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,479
So, I shall take your leave,
today is Martyrs Day.

200
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,439
I'm going to pay my respects to the Martyrs.

201
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:15,482
And you too.

202
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:19,486
Should i take flowers for you?

203
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,780
No thanks, Mr. Johny.

204
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:24,032
My martyrs are of a different kind.

205
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,451
So are my condolences.

206
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,038
Aren't you getting late?

207
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:35,418
Absolutely. I want to do a lot in life,
Mr. Khan, but time is too less.

208
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:40,965
I sometimes wonder, if instead of one,
I was two Johnys.

209
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,427
You'd probvably have more trouble.

210
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:48,264
But don't worry, God didn't
make another Johny.

211
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:58,066
- Which seeds are you sowing, Gopi?
- I don't know, kaka (uncle).

212
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:01,319
Lord told me to sow, I'm sowing.

213
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:08,493
This is 'kost'.
Is the new owner trading canabbis?

214
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,329
That's a crime, kaka.

215
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,498
Yeah, according to the law, it's a crime.

216
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,377
But so what? We have to do our labour.

217
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:21,381
No, kaka! If we get caught, the
police will put me behind bars.

218
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:23,675
Hey, Bholu, ratna, Puttu!

219
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:27,345
Look what he's saying! This won't do' Kaka.

220
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,472
What are you doing, Gopi?

221
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,016
Are you going to rebel against the lord?

222
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:35,937
Why shouldn't I? Lord Ram said,
'those who help robbers, are robbers'.

223
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,605
I will not do this.

224
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,987
Get back to work everyone,
the Lord is coming.

225
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:49,701
No body move. We will not do this
illegal trade in our village.

226
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:55,665
What is happening here?

227
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,417
Why has the work stopped?

228
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,461
- I stopped the work, Sir.
- Why?

229
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:03,173
You're making us sow cannabis
instead of mustard seeds.

230
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:04,424
Why?

231
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,384
- Who does this farm belong to?
- You.

232
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,428
Who paid for the fetilizers and seeds?

233
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:09,554
You did.

234
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,389
Whose servant are you?

235
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:12,182
Yours.

236
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:14,934
And you dare to argue with me?

237
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,195
Sir!

238
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,577
Asshole! I'll sow you in the ground
instead of these seeds.

239
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:40,168
Gopi! Gopi!

240
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:44,089
Gopi! Get up, child. Get up.

241
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,799
Move aside, old lady!

242
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:52,847
Sir! Let him go, I beg you let him go.
I apologize if he's done anything wrong.

243
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,349
Let him go, Sir.

244
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:58,395
Sabu, suspend him for a month!

245
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,355
His brains will work then!

246
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:06,444
Everybody get back to work.
Useless idiots.

247
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:07,821
Get back to work everyone!

248
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:17,706
How many times to tell you, Gopi,
don't interfere in other's matters.

249
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,667
But you just don't control your tongue.

250
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,585
Shouldn't I speak up for injustice?

251
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:29,759
No! Justice and injust is God's decision.
He gives punishments and justice.

252
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:33,722
then why was I punished without any crime?

253
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:39,519
Our only crime is, we are poor.
This world is for rich people.

254
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:42,647
Those who have money are the ones
that have the world at their feet.

255
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,942
Are you saying money has all the power?

256
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:49,446
Yes, they believe money to be their God.

257
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:53,366
Okay, Grandma. One day I'll become God.

258
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:57,037
- What are you saying?
- I'm telling you the truth.

259
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,958
I swear on these wounds on my back,
I'll become rich.

260
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:06,671
One day, I'll have the whip and
the Lord will be getting hit.

261
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:11,551
I'm telling you, don't go.
There is nothing in the city.

262
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:15,847
No, Grandma. Now that I have made
my decision, I won't change it.

263
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:17,974
I'll find something to do once
I reach the city.

264
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:19,100
Isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah.

265
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:21,853
And as soon as I get a job, I'll get you a...

266
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:24,814
A daughter in law, right?

267
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:25,732
Yes, grandma.

268
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,485
The train is about to leave, I'll go.

269
00:34:28,693 --> 00:34:30,570
- Give me your blessings.
- Yes, yes. Go carefully.

270
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:34,866
You take care of yourself!

271
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:41,414
Gopi, take care of all your money.

272
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:46,586
Don't use it in front of anyone. I have
packed food, eat that if your hungry.

273
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:52,634
Go to the temple when you reach the city.
And don't do anything wrong, my son.

274
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:55,595
Grandma, I swear, I won't do anything wrong.

275
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:57,055
You take care.

276
00:34:58,014 --> 00:34:59,224
Go. why are you crying?

277
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:06,147
Don't worry. I'll write you a letter
as soon as I reach the city.

278
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:12,821
God, he's an orphan. Please protect him.

279
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,901
Oh lord, Sukhi was right.

280
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:55,280
Looking at houses here, a
person's hat could fall off.

281
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:00,827
Hey, Lord Ram, beware!

282
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:05,415
It's not far that these people will
come live in your house.

283
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,088
Where did my luggage go?

284
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:18,053
Sir? My...

285
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:19,804
That is a madam.

286
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:22,974
Forgive me, I was mistaken.

287
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:31,775
Sorry.

288
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,279
Saree? She isn't wearing a saree.

289
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:38,114
What kind of city is this.

290
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:40,700
She forgot her saree home and
she's asking me for it?

291
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:43,536
My luggage is robbed.

292
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:47,165
Did you see 'Barsat Ki Ek Raat'?
- Yup.

293
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:49,918
Did you like it?

294
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,461
- I liked it.
- I loved it.

295
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,092
I think I'll have to go hungry today.

296
00:36:58,218 --> 00:36:59,469
Funny chap, man.

297
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,285
Father?

298
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:29,207
Dad? Dad? Dad?

299
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:30,917
Wake up.

300
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:33,503
Who are you?

301
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,547
I am your son.

302
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,673
Son?

303
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:41,761
Ramji, what kind of city is this!
Listen, I am not yet married.

304
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,304
How am I your father?

305
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:45,765
Son, I am not your father.

306
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:48,309
If your not my father why are
you calling me son?

307
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:54,399
I know everything, you got angry at
mummy and went away.

308
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,192
Who is Maami?

309
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:59,404
My mother. She always cried.

310
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:06,828
She said you would come,
but you never came, daddy.

311
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:10,206
- And she left.
- Left? Where did she go?

312
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:15,170
To god. She was very ill and he died.

313
00:38:15,628 --> 00:38:19,924
While dying, Maa said, look for your father.

314
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:24,137
I looked for you everywhere, dad,
but couldn't find you.

315
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,265
See, I walked so much,
even my feet became small.

316
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:33,646
Dad, please don't leave me.

317
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:40,487
No, son. We both don't have
anyone in this town.

318
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:45,116
Nobody loves me, dad. Will you love me?

319
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:47,869
- Yes.
- Everyday?

320
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:54,125
Take me home.

321
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:54,959
Home?

322
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:57,128
I am very hungry.

323
00:38:57,545 --> 00:39:02,175
Even I am hungry. Son, what's your name?

324
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,886
Don't you know my name is Raju?

325
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:10,308
Look, Raju, I have lost
everything in this city.

326
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,645
All my luggage got robbed.
I don't even have 10 pence.

327
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,731
If you don't have 10 pence,
here, I'll give it to you.

328
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,653
Son, we won't get any food for 10 pence.

329
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:26,866
No problem, I'll stay hungry with you,
I have a habit of staying hungry.

330
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:33,289
Just don't leave me. I won't ask for
anything, not even bread.

331
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,252
Whatever God wants.

332
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:41,548
Look, Raju, it seems like even
God is hungry, today.

333
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:43,883
There are no offerings in the plate.

334
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:49,514
But don't worry, I'll get some food for you.

335
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:50,890
You sit right here.

336
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:54,644
I'm also coming, otherwise
you'll leave me again.

337
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:59,941
No, son, no. I won't leave you.
I swear to God.

338
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:03,820
I will never leave your side. You sit here.

339
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,781
Come soon.

340
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,742
Yes, son. I'll come soon.

341
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:22,922
Maa, see I found my dad.

342
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:25,342
Now, I don't need this.

343
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:30,805
Here, God. Now, you take care of this.
Hail Lord Ram!

344
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:39,230
How long is this Johny going to make us wait?

345
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:42,567
I'll wait all my life if he comes only for me.

346
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:46,905
- It's taking a lot of time.
- Who knows what happened.

347
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:57,499
Ma'am?

348
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,418
Johny? You?

349
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:06,758
Johny! Johny! Johny! Johny!

350
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,343
Is someone getting married?

351
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:10,512
Yes, you to me.

352
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:14,307
Will I get some food?

353
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:15,517
Yes, definitely.

354
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:19,604
- You joke so much.
- Yeah, I love to joke.

355
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:23,983
Excuse me? Mr. Johny?

356
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:26,236
This is such a surprise.

357
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:31,616
Johny? Who is Johny? My name is Gopi, Gopi.

358
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:34,160
We are all your Dasis.

359
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:35,328
Please come in.

360
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:36,413
I don't have any money.

361
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:37,664
Please come in.

362
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:39,332
- Inside?
- please come.

363
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,084
Take this, we are going in.

364
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:44,921
Take this, now cut the ribbon.

365
00:41:45,755 --> 00:41:47,590
- After I cut this will I get food?
- Yes.

366
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:49,300
Why do we need a scissor? Here you go!

367
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:53,847
Oh Lord Ram! What was that, lightning?

368
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:57,642
You are giving out lighting to my heart.

369
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:02,564
I swear to Lord Ram, I didn't do anything.
It happened on it's own.

370
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:04,858
My name is Jyoti.

371
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:10,572
Jyoti, please show me the way.
Raju is waiting for me, we are very hungry.

372
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:11,948
Who is Raju?

373
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:14,284
He's probably calling Raj Kapoor, Raju.

374
00:42:16,077 --> 00:42:16,661
Come.

375
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:21,458
Oh Ram, it's so decorated.

376
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:22,834
It's great.

377
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:25,337
- It's all for you... Come.
- For me?

378
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,297
This way.

379
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:32,302
It's beautiful.

380
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:40,101
Sit.

381
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:42,103
Please sit.

382
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:54,157
You promised you will eat with me.

383
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:57,160
If you say so, then I'll eat both
my meals with you.

384
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:01,873
But not today, Raju is waiting
for me at Ram mandir.

385
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:04,042
But we wnat to hear you sing.
- Sing?

386
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:09,589
You want me to sing to Lord Ram?

387
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:13,718
But haven't you heard?
No one can sing when hungry.

388
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:18,515
I'm calling from Mr. Johny's office.
His flight from Delhi is delayed..

389
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,351
..and he won't be able to come
for the restaurant opening.

390
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:22,310
What?

391
00:43:22,977 --> 00:43:25,980
What are you saying?
Mr. Johny is sitting right here.

392
00:43:26,272 --> 00:43:27,482
He's sitting there?

393
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:32,237
Yes! And for your kind information,
the Restaurant has been inaugrated.

394
00:43:32,904 --> 00:43:33,446
Strange.

395
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,825
May be he landed and directly went there.

396
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:40,995
Mac, take the car to Golden Gate for Johny.

397
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,456
No, no, not me!

398
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:45,041
All those songs are from movies.

399
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:48,670
- But I was Seeta in Ram Leela...
- Here you go.

400
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:53,299
It smells brilliant.

401
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:55,010
I'll take your leave.

402
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,219
Thank you very much.

403
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:01,182
If I come tomorrow, will I get food?

404
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:02,017
No!

405
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:03,810
No?

406
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:07,147
Tomorrow, you'll have to sit
here and eat with me.

407
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:10,108
No problem, I'll sit with you and eat.

408
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,028
For how long will this marriage go on?

409
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:19,075
It's just started, you have
to take it upto mariage.

410
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:22,662
I don't know what you are saying.

411
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:27,584
But if thiis before marriage,
then the marriage will be grand!

412
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:30,128
I'll come, I'll definitely come.

413
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:32,130
- Hail Lord Ram.
- Hail Lord Ram.

414
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:38,053
Raju? Hey, Raju?

415
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:40,055
- Look what I goty you.
- Did you get me food, dad?

416
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:40,597
Sit

417
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:43,933
There is food in this box for you.

418
00:44:46,936 --> 00:44:47,771
There he is.

419
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:50,732
There, eat, son.

420
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:57,697
Good afternoon.

421
00:45:01,117 --> 00:45:05,413
Boss, we went to Golden Gate to look for you,
they said you have come to the temple.

422
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:09,084
We looked for you at every temple,
finally we found you here.

423
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:09,876
What is it?

424
00:45:10,126 --> 00:45:11,086
We have come to take you.

425
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,213
- Where are you taking me?
- To your house.

426
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:14,005
Come.

427
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:20,845
- Dad, you have a house? You said,...
- Son. even I don't know what all I have.

428
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:22,972
Hey, who are you guys?

429
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:25,517
We are your servants, Sir.

430
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:30,522
Heard that? We got food and
I have servants too.

431
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,439
And a car too.

432
00:45:32,732 --> 00:45:34,943
- Should we go see the house too?
- Yeah.

433
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:41,574
Sukhi was right, no one knows what
will happen when in this city.

434
00:45:41,866 --> 00:45:42,659
Come, Son.

435
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:44,703
Take me home!

436
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:46,037
Sit.

437
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:58,842
Wow! This is a grand bungalow, Raju.

438
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,928
- Is this yours?
- Why are you kidding?

439
00:46:02,345 --> 00:46:04,889
Hey, Raju. This is fun.

440
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:08,768
It's a very beautiful house.

441
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:14,899
- Sit.
- No, i ate too much, you sit.

442
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,279
Sit.

443
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:22,490
- What are you saying?
- Sit! I told you to.

444
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,370
Stand up. I  said, stand.

445
00:46:28,955 --> 00:46:32,083
- Wow, you'll stood up.
- You told us to.

446
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:35,420
- So you will do whatever I tell you?
- We'll have to.

447
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:37,047
We are your servants.

448
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,506
We'll dance to your tunes.

449
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:42,594
Tunes,.. I have a flute, you dance.

450
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:44,679
Dad, can i also dance?

451
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:46,222
Yes, Son. Even you can dance.

452
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:16,336
What is this? is this what you call dance?

453
00:47:16,711 --> 00:47:17,629
This is all we know, Sir.

454
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:19,047
See.

455
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,974
- Hi, Rita.
- Hi, Johny.

456
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:32,477
Come, let me show you something.

457
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,486
Wow! He looks exactly like me.

458
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,823
Yeah, for a second even I got fooled.

459
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:50,704
- Do you want to meet our guest?
- Yes.

460
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:53,748
Get Sir down.

461
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:59,379
Sir, let's go down.

462
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:01,423
Why down? Why not up?

463
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:02,966
Sir, please.

464
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:07,554
- Okay, come Raju.
- Sir, let him rest here.

465
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:10,557
Okay. You take good care of him.

466
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:12,475
Raju, I'll be back.

467
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:23,820
Woah! That was a miracle.

468
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:27,741
I don't understand, is it a door in the
wall or a wall in the door?

469
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,367
Please.

470
00:48:29,826 --> 00:48:30,702
Come.

471
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:49,804
This way.

472
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,225
It's quite grand.

473
00:49:06,988 --> 00:49:09,032
Why is there such a big mirror in the way.

474
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,451
Move this.

475
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:18,958
What sorcerry is this Ramji?
Where have I come?

476
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:25,215
What kind of city is this?
People rob luggage and faces too?

477
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:30,178
Brother, are you me or am I you?

478
00:49:31,137 --> 00:49:33,098
I am Johny. You are?

479
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:37,394
Gopi. I have come from the village.
To look for a job.

480
00:49:38,478 --> 00:49:40,146
So, now you have a job.

481
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:45,151
Wow, Lord Ram. What do I have to do?

482
00:49:46,611 --> 00:49:47,862
You will have to become Johny.

483
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:49,197
What do you mean?

484
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:53,201
God has given both of us the same face.

485
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:59,124
But our behaviors and charecteristics
are very different.

486
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:01,876
We'll have to get rid of these differences.

487
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:05,630
Which means, there iwll be no difference
between you and me.

488
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:11,886
Hey, there is no sin in making these
differences go, right?

489
00:50:12,595 --> 00:50:18,184
Look brother, I have promised my Grandma, I
will not do anything sinful.

490
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:20,228
Which means you are a truthful person.

491
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:23,398
You are religious? And you believe in God?

492
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:26,151
Absolutely. I'm a Ram bhakt.
(Lord Ram's Desciple).

493
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,445
Then you will have to help me.

494
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:32,657
I'm doing a selfess job for
a friend of mine.

495
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:33,908
What?

496
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:38,496
Gopi, I want to make a fertilizer,..

497
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:44,210
..which will allow 12 times the crop yeild.

498
00:50:44,836 --> 00:50:48,173
12? You mean a new yeild in every month?

499
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:55,055
Yes. I want to get rid of hunger and
poverty from the nation.

500
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:58,224
You hurry up! I'm with you.

501
00:50:58,767 --> 00:51:03,980
Gopi, if the enemies of our nation find
out about this fertilizer,..

502
00:51:04,522 --> 00:51:07,942
..they'll kill me and take it to their land.

503
00:51:09,361 --> 00:51:14,532
And our Country will remain hungry and poor.

504
00:51:15,575 --> 00:51:20,038
That's why i want to hide my work.

505
00:51:21,873 --> 00:51:28,213
But if i don't meet my fans, friends,
my people..

506
00:51:28,505 --> 00:51:29,881
..they will start to doubt things.

507
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:35,595
- So..
- So until then I should become Johny.

508
00:51:36,721 --> 00:51:39,057
But brother, how will I become Johny?

509
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:46,981
Rita, turn Gopi to Johny within a month.

510
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:50,318
Okay, Johny, I'll become johny.

511
00:51:50,652 --> 00:51:52,195
But my Raju has to stay with me.

512
00:51:53,029 --> 00:51:54,406
All the arrangements will be done.

513
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:56,658
But even i have one condition.

514
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,159
Tell me.

515
00:51:58,743 --> 00:52:01,413
What is the most dearest to you?

516
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,917
That... That is my Grandmother.
She lives in the village.

517
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:09,838
So swear on Grandma,
you will not tell anyone.

518
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,678
Done. I swear on Grandma,
I'll die but not tell anyone.

519
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:18,346
One more thing.

520
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:24,310
We'll both live in the same house,
you live upstairs and me here, down.

521
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:32,277
But when we leave the house we have
to inform each other.

522
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:37,365
At one time, only one of us can be outside.

523
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:38,658
Understood.

524
00:52:40,201 --> 00:52:43,121
Start training him.

525
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:34,232
Rita!

526
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:45,535
That's Gopi! Not Johny.

527
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:53,126
How could you be mistaken.

528
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:06,264
Wow, Gopi! That was brilliant.

529
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:10,810
Oh, Shut up, Gopi! I'm Johny.

530
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:14,439
- Yes?
- No, It's impossible.

531
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:20,070
Nothing is impossible for Johny.

532
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:21,196
Come, Rita.

533
00:55:22,238 --> 00:55:24,824
Come on, Rita, I am Johny.

534
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:30,330
Come on, Rita, come on, I am Johny.

535
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:55,340
Oh, Johny!

536
01:01:59,135 --> 01:01:59,678
Hello?

537
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:03,890
Hello? Can I speak to Mr. Johny?
I am Jyoti.

538
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:05,850
Hey, Jyoti, how are you?

539
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:08,353
I have still not forgotten the
food from your hotel.

540
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:11,648
And me? It seems like you forgot me.

541
01:02:12,023 --> 01:02:15,318
How can I forget you, you helped me
when I was hungry.

542
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:18,655
But you said, you'll come everyday to eat.

543
01:02:19,155 --> 01:02:22,617
Okay then, if you want, I'll reach right away.

544
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:25,578
Okay, even I'm reaching the
hotel in 10 minutes.

545
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,329
Okay, I'll see you there.

546
01:02:26,913 --> 01:02:27,163
See you.

547
01:02:27,747 --> 01:02:28,790
- Bye.
- Bye.

548
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:22,677
Doctor, I can't see anything!

549
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:25,347
- Jyoti?
- Doctor? Why it so dark?

550
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:26,348
Jyoti?

551
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:33,146
I'm really sorry Miss Jyoti, because of a
fall, your optic nerve is damaged forever.

552
01:03:33,438 --> 01:03:36,649
Doctor? Will she not be able to see?

553
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:38,068
No.

554
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:46,409
What are you doing? You will have to
stay at the hospital for 2 weeks.

555
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:49,037
Inspector, you can take a statement.

556
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:51,998
Miss Jyoti, I'm Sub Inspector, Rane.

557
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:57,504
You can give me a complaint against
Mr. Johny, I'll take it down.

558
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:02,133
No, Inspector, I'm to be blamed
for this accident.

559
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:06,346
Mr. Johny is not at fault.

560
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:10,558
Miss Jyoti, the police has filed a case
against Mr. Johny.

561
01:04:10,892 --> 01:04:13,436
Your statement is very important
to us in the court.

562
01:04:14,145 --> 01:04:17,023
No, I don't want to give a statement.

563
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:19,317
Are you threatened by anyone?

564
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:21,319
threatened? No.

565
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:23,530
Then why won't you give a statement.

566
01:04:24,155 --> 01:04:26,449
It's her choice to give a statement or not.

567
01:04:27,325 --> 01:04:29,536
You can't force anyone to give a statement.

568
01:04:30,286 --> 01:04:33,540
And then th ewhole city knows,
Johny is a good man.

569
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:35,959
He didn't purposely have this accident.

570
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:37,210
Am i right, Miss Jyoti?

571
01:04:37,877 --> 01:04:42,173
Yes. This accident was my ill fate.

572
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,471
Please let the patient rest.

573
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:49,723
Sure, doctor.

574
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:52,225
Come, Inspector Rane.

575
01:04:59,441 --> 01:05:04,529
It was my fault, Jyoti, why didn't
you tell the inspector?

576
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:08,116
Would that get my eyesight back?

577
01:05:09,492 --> 01:05:12,245
Forget what happened.

578
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:22,005
Did you have an accident?

579
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:24,090
yes.

580
01:05:24,966 --> 01:05:26,551
A girl crashed into my car.

581
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:28,678
Why didn't you tell us?

582
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:32,849
Why? What would you do?

583
01:05:34,809 --> 01:05:36,061
I had taken her to hospital.

584
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:40,190
You know, she lost her eyes.

585
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:45,987
I was responsible for a girl becoming blind.

586
01:05:46,821 --> 01:05:52,619
with these demonic hands...
Johny, that girl has no one.

587
01:05:53,661 --> 01:05:56,664
And I have decided to bring her here.

588
01:05:57,207 --> 01:05:58,124
She will live with me.

589
01:05:58,375 --> 01:05:59,584
Gopi, this is a house!

590
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:02,796
It's not a hotel or hostel.

591
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:08,009
Hey, it's impossible for you to
stay here with that girl!

592
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:12,514
- Rita, no!
- Yeah, kill me!

593
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:14,683
I don't want to stay here.

594
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:21,856
you told me tobe Johny, if you want
I'll leave and go to my village.

595
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:30,824
No, gopi. I'm happy, the first time I
saw a shadow of Johny in you.

596
01:06:31,616 --> 01:06:33,034
Keep it up, boy. Keep it up.

597
01:06:47,465 --> 01:06:50,635
Thank you, doctor. I'm indebted to you.

598
01:06:51,428 --> 01:06:53,722
You took really good care of me.

599
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:57,392
Where will you go?
Let the hospital car drop you.

600
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:04,733
Today the hospital car will help,
but all my life I'm on my own.

601
01:07:04,899 --> 01:07:05,650
Here you go.

602
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:13,700
This is the same stick right? Red and white.
The eye for the blind.

603
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:15,577
Thank you.

604
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:25,879
- This is not required, Doctor.
- Johny?

605
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:32,177
Yes, Jyoti. I can't take back
the mistake I made.

606
01:07:35,096 --> 01:07:43,271
But if youcan take me as your life support,
I'll be indebted to you.

607
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:45,565
Come.

608
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:54,908
Come, Jyoti.

609
01:07:55,575 --> 01:07:56,785
This is our home.

610
01:07:57,577 --> 01:07:59,329
And from now on you will live here.

611
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:05,835
What is this place?

612
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:08,088
This is the hall (living room).

613
01:08:08,922 --> 01:08:11,883
Right opposite that is the dinning room.

614
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:15,178
This way, that is the left, is my room.

615
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:24,771
And here, on your right, is a staircase,
that goes straight to the library.

616
01:08:25,021 --> 01:08:27,357
And Jyoti, there are so so many books there...

617
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,694
Books? I used to love to read.

618
01:08:31,152 --> 01:08:34,572
I'm sorry, this is all my fault.

619
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,784
Good day, Sir.

620
01:08:37,992 --> 01:08:38,785
Rita?

621
01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:43,081
This letter came from the Punchgani school,
Raju has got the admission.

622
01:08:43,748 --> 01:08:45,417
School starts next monday.

623
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:47,669
Good. thank you.

624
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:53,216
Come, I'll show you your bedroom.

625
01:08:56,928 --> 01:08:57,804
Who was this girl?

626
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:00,807
My secritary, Rita.

627
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:02,809
And who is Raju?

628
01:09:04,185 --> 01:09:05,186
You can say he is my son.

629
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:06,146
What do you mean?

630
01:09:07,522 --> 01:09:08,815
I'll explain later.

631
01:09:09,315 --> 01:09:10,191
Come.

632
01:09:13,194 --> 01:09:14,279
This is your bedroom.

633
01:09:15,655 --> 01:09:17,615
And this room is on the left as soon
as you climb the stairs.

634
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:18,533
Sit.

635
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:26,541
Raju? Why are you hiding? Come, meet aunty.

636
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:29,336
No i feel shy.

637
01:09:30,545 --> 01:09:32,213
Why are you shy? Come.

638
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:35,133
I'm not wearing clothes, she'll see that.

639
01:09:35,342 --> 01:09:38,136
No, Raju, I can't see anything.

640
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:42,265
Yes, Raju. Aunty lost her eyes
in an accident.

641
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:47,687
Oh! Can't you see anything?

642
01:09:47,937 --> 01:09:48,605
No.

643
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:55,862
It's okay aunty, don't worry.
I'll always stay with you.

644
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:59,115
I'll take good care of you.

645
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:02,577
That's very sweet Raju. You are very sweet.

646
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:08,917
You are also very sweet and beautiful.
Will you be friends with me?

647
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:11,378
Yes, definitely.

648
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:13,505
Come, Raju, let's wear our clothes.

649
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:15,548
Give, I'll do it.

650
01:10:16,883 --> 01:10:19,427
Give it, Raju and I are now friends.

651
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:33,024
Daddy, why are you silent?

652
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:34,442
No, I'm not.

653
01:10:34,943 --> 01:10:38,655
- aunty, why are you silent?
- No.

654
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:41,074
I know everything.

655
01:10:41,282 --> 01:10:42,492
What do you know?

656
01:10:42,701 --> 01:10:46,371
Daddy, you love aunty.

657
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:04,170
Say what you have to, but it's not right
for Gopi to keep that girl here.

658
01:15:05,547 --> 01:15:09,801
I know. But I have put a lot
of money on him.

659
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:16,266
Let me get my profits and then
see me destroying Gopi.

660
01:15:17,517 --> 01:15:21,938
As it is, she is blind. She won't
know what we are doing.

661
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,317
- Hello?
- Speak to the Supremo.

662
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:28,194
Hi, Supremo. Good day.

663
01:15:28,778 --> 01:15:33,700
- You were supposed to give the treasure.
- Yes! You can take it now.

664
01:15:34,993 --> 01:15:37,537
- Where?
- Near the swamp at Monkey Hill.

665
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,230
What's in it?

666
01:16:05,315 --> 01:16:08,568
The King's treasure woth Billions.

667
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:09,611
I see.

668
01:16:36,429 --> 01:16:42,727
Sorry Johny. You are definitely smart,
but the state gaurds are smarter.

669
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,604
This is false.

670
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:49,693
How is it possible?
So many gaurds and security?

671
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:53,363
It's to fool smartasses like you.

672
01:16:54,322 --> 01:17:00,537
When you were robbing the fake treasure,
the king transferred it to the right plac.

673
01:17:03,623 --> 01:17:05,041
Think of another scheme Johny.

674
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:08,336
I want to see you progress to billions.

675
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:11,840
I'll give you one more month's time.

676
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,553
There is one way.

677
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:24,686
After 12 years, next week, on Janmastrami,
a Krishna voyage is happening.

678
01:17:25,562 --> 01:17:30,859
If you get me that idol,
I'll give you your freedom.

679
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:32,777
Best of Luck.

680
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:41,703
Hello?

681
01:17:42,662 --> 01:17:43,371
Hi, Rita.

682
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:48,668
Johny had to go to the opening of
Lion Musical Festival, but he's busy.

683
01:17:48,918 --> 01:17:50,628
So you go immediately.

684
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:55,633
Okay. I'll be therein 10 minutes.
See you, Rita.

685
01:17:57,385 --> 01:17:59,971
Are you going out?

686
01:18:01,431 --> 01:18:04,476
Yeah, I should be back in half an hour.

687
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:06,728
Isn't it raining outside?

688
01:18:06,936 --> 01:18:07,645
Yes.

689
01:18:08,104 --> 01:18:10,523
Wait, let me get your coat.

690
01:18:20,533 --> 01:18:23,495
I'll be back in sometime, Bye.

691
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:33,254
I believe, you all have understood
our voyage scheme.

692
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:34,089
Yes, Sir.

693
01:18:34,297 --> 01:18:35,965
- Any questions?
- no, sir.

694
01:18:52,315 --> 01:18:55,902
There, Gopi is home. Now, we can go.
Let's go, Rita.

695
01:19:00,699 --> 01:19:03,785
- Hi!
- Hey, you're back.

696
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,288
Your coat?

697
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:09,541
I'll just get it.

698
01:19:12,168 --> 01:19:14,254
If everything goes as planned,..

699
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:21,469
...then next Monday, the Krishna idol
worth 20 million, will be Johny's.

700
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:27,058
My coat.

701
01:19:35,191 --> 01:19:36,901
Thanks. Good night.

702
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:31,539
So everything is according to the plan.

703
01:20:32,707 --> 01:20:37,045
Next Monday, the Krishna idod worth
20 million rupees will be Johny's.

704
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,806
Hello? Police headquarters?

705
01:20:48,473 --> 01:20:53,853
I'm CID officer, Jyoti. Next monday,
Johny is going to steal the Krishna Idol.

706
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:57,399
Yes, they still think I'm blind.

707
01:21:13,748 --> 01:21:17,377
Jyoti? Jyoti!

708
01:21:18,586 --> 01:21:19,796
- You're back?
- Yes.

709
01:21:20,463 --> 01:21:21,256
Here, have this.

710
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:24,968
And now I want something in return.

711
01:21:25,176 --> 01:21:28,513
Why something? Whatever belongs
to me, is all yours.

712
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:34,185
Tomorrow, there's a voyage,
can you take me there?

713
01:21:34,394 --> 01:21:36,479
Why not? I myself was thinking of going.

714
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:39,065
I knew you wouldn't say no.

715
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:42,902
Okay, tell me this, what will
you ask God for me?

716
01:21:43,403 --> 01:21:47,157
If God answers my prayers,
then tomorrow you'll know.

717
01:21:48,616 --> 01:21:54,998
Judge, let the punishment be long, this
prisoner wants to be imprisoned for life.

718
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:58,335
In these arms.

719
01:22:04,382 --> 01:22:08,219
Hello? yes. Okay, I'll be there.

720
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:15,018
I have some important work, I'll see you soon.

721
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:44,089
Hi, Gopi. Tomorrow, you have to play snooker
with the CBI officer Mr. Khan.

722
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:49,344
No, no, I am taking Jyoti for the
Krishna voyage tomorrow.

723
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:52,597
Krishna voyage?

724
01:22:52,972 --> 01:22:56,601
She wishes to go, she wants
to be a part of it.

725
01:22:57,936 --> 01:23:05,235
Gopi, my beloved mother's dying wish was
for me to take part in the voyage.

726
01:23:06,111 --> 01:23:08,822
So you come along. But both of us?

727
01:23:09,072 --> 01:23:10,782
But I promised the CBI officer.

728
01:23:11,574 --> 01:23:15,286
Gopi, what if we take Jyoti to
the Voyage with us?

729
01:23:16,037 --> 01:23:22,252
This fits. You go play snooker, while I pray
and even Jyoti gets to go.

730
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:29,217
Okay, work is worship after all.
I'll play snooker with Khan. You go.

731
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:31,011
Thanks, Gopi.

732
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:37,559
- Rita, train Gopi with my best shots.
- Okay. Let's go, Gopi.

733
01:29:49,139 --> 01:29:50,682
Game over!

734
01:29:51,057 --> 01:29:56,855
Johny, you one this one. But remember,
everyone has to lose one day.

735
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:00,859
- And that day you will see my targets.
- of course I will and I'll praise it too.

736
01:30:01,317 --> 01:30:03,111
Only if the target is worth priasing.

737
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:04,696
Shall I leave?

738
01:30:04,904 --> 01:30:07,115
May God be with you.
- And you.

739
01:30:13,038 --> 01:30:13,997
Yes?

740
01:30:14,414 --> 01:30:19,002
Sir, this is Inspector Chopra, the idol has
been stolen from the voyage.

741
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:21,588
What? The idol was stolen?

742
01:30:22,881 --> 01:30:23,923
There is nothing to worry about.

743
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:31,222
You probably don't know but after Inspector
Jyoti's information, we placed a fake idol.

744
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:33,558
Tell me who robbed it!

745
01:30:34,684 --> 01:30:36,770
Sir, Johny robbed the idol.

746
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:38,188
What nonsense!

747
01:30:38,605 --> 01:30:41,274
You have either lost your mind or
your eyesight is weak.

748
01:30:41,691 --> 01:30:43,735
Johnny was right here,
playing snooker with me.

749
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:49,282
Believe me, Sir. That was Johny, my bullet
hit his leg, but he got away in a helicopter.

750
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:56,039
Really? If your bullet hit the right place,
tonight, there's a dance program, we'll see there.

751
01:31:00,418 --> 01:31:03,046
You're lucky, Johny. The wound is not deep.

752
01:31:04,047 --> 01:31:07,050
Rest today, you should be okay tomorrow.

753
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:09,302
I'll cancel the evening show.

754
01:31:09,427 --> 01:31:14,516
No, Rita. this is the best time to
fool the inspector.

755
01:31:15,558 --> 01:31:19,062
Tonight, you will go with Gopi for the
show instead of me.

756
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:22,816
And you know very well how to
take care of a show.

757
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,496
- Good evening, sir.
- Good Evening.

758
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:44,963
What is it? It's time for the program.

759
01:31:45,171 --> 01:31:48,717
Yes, it's been 15 minutes but
there's no trace of Johny.

760
01:31:49,884 --> 01:31:54,472
- He will come, Mr. Chopra.
- He is hit by a bullet not a thorn.

761
01:31:54,681 --> 01:31:56,141
How will he come?

762
01:37:04,532 --> 01:37:05,700
- Hello.
- Come in, Mr. Khan.

763
01:37:05,992 --> 01:37:08,620
Well done, Mr. Johny, you really had us awed.

764
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:11,414
What a dance. Congratulations.

765
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:18,463
Even I'm awed, I have so much pain in
my legs and yet this program.

766
01:37:19,464 --> 01:37:24,469
I was probably scared of you and
people thought I was dancing.

767
01:37:26,471 --> 01:37:28,723
Are you wounded?

768
01:37:28,848 --> 01:37:35,689
I don't know what it is. But it feels
like a bullet went through.

769
01:38:03,383 --> 01:38:06,219
Yeah, I can walk now.

770
01:38:06,428 --> 01:38:08,096
Sir, there's a telegram for Gopi.

771
01:38:14,894 --> 01:38:17,188
Gopi's grandma is coming on the 13th.

772
01:38:21,151 --> 01:38:22,277
And tomorrow is the 13th.

773
01:38:32,579 --> 01:38:34,956
Gopi! Hey, Gopi?

774
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:39,044
I'm here. Come, come.

775
01:38:43,006 --> 01:38:48,720
Hey, have you forgotten all your manners?
Shouldn't you be touching my feet?

776
01:38:48,928 --> 01:38:50,722
I forgot.

777
01:38:51,014 --> 01:38:52,349
Stay blessed, be happy.

778
01:38:52,599 --> 01:38:55,393
You look like such a city man.

779
01:38:55,602 --> 01:38:58,146
We have to wear such clothes
in the city, grandmom.

780
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,148
What is this grandmom busines?

781
01:39:00,357 --> 01:39:01,024
Is something wrong?

782
01:39:01,232 --> 01:39:03,943
Obviously! Didn't you call me Grandma
back in the village.

783
01:39:05,653 --> 01:39:10,241
- Grandma! Forgive me.
- Live happily, my child.

784
01:39:10,825 --> 01:39:14,120
When you get such good clothes in the
city, don't you get goo food?

785
01:39:14,496 --> 01:39:16,247
- Why?
- You have lost weight.

786
01:39:20,877 --> 01:39:23,838
Don't be offended, Mr. Johny, the camera
clicked itself when it saw you.

787
01:39:25,298 --> 01:39:26,257
Listen...

788
01:39:29,344 --> 01:39:32,013
- Cn I get a copy of that?
- Sure, Sir. I'll come deliver it.

789
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:33,139
Thank you, Sir.

790
01:39:36,643 --> 01:39:38,561
Come, Grandmom... I mean Grandma.

791
01:39:50,156 --> 01:39:51,116
Come, grandma.

792
01:39:57,789 --> 01:39:59,040
Is this your house?

793
01:39:59,249 --> 01:40:01,126
- Come.
- Oh, Lord.

794
01:40:02,502 --> 01:40:07,340
Grandma, this is Ramu, he
takes care of the house.

795
01:40:08,425 --> 01:40:11,261
And this is Shamu. He does the cooking.

796
01:40:11,344 --> 01:40:15,765
Son, you know I never eat what someone
else cooks. I'll cook my own food.

797
01:40:16,725 --> 01:40:19,519
Okay, tell him whatever you want.

798
01:40:19,728 --> 01:40:21,271
Don't you live in this house.

799
01:40:21,813 --> 01:40:25,775
No, Grandma, I live here but I have
to go out quite often.

800
01:40:26,234 --> 01:40:28,653
- OhGod! I am going I have a meeting.
- Hey, listen.

801
01:40:29,904 --> 01:40:31,197
All of this is yours, right?

802
01:40:31,531 --> 01:40:32,824
Yes, grandma it's all mine.

803
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,952
Listen, you aren't doing anything
bad, are you?

804
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:40,582
Your son can never do anything
sinful, grandma.

805
01:40:41,541 --> 01:40:42,167
I'll go?

806
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:44,169
Come back before sunset, okay?

807
01:40:44,377 --> 01:40:46,963
I will, but pray to god my work gets done.

808
01:40:47,172 --> 01:40:48,256
It will, son, it will.

809
01:40:55,013 --> 01:40:56,639
- What happened then?
- What could happen?

810
01:40:57,307 --> 01:41:04,356
Once Grandmom became Garndma, your Johny
was Gopi at Grandma's feet.

811
01:41:04,564 --> 01:41:08,068
Gopi?

812
01:42:15,343 --> 01:42:17,429
Johny, yesterday's danceshow was amazing.

813
01:42:18,805 --> 01:42:20,140
Even here something happened.

814
01:42:20,348 --> 01:42:21,224
What?

815
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:23,184
Blind people somehow have eyes now.

816
01:42:23,977 --> 01:42:24,477
What do you mean?

817
01:42:24,686 --> 01:42:28,732
The light of your eyes, Jyoti, hasn't lost
the light of her own eyes.

818
01:42:29,524 --> 01:42:30,442
She can see.

819
01:42:31,401 --> 01:42:32,193
She can see?

820
01:42:33,069 --> 01:42:33,945
How is that possible?

821
01:42:35,196 --> 01:42:36,239
You are definitely mistaken.

822
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:42,746
Wouldn't I know if she wasn't blind?
And why does she need to be blind?

823
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,541
Even I want to know.

824
01:42:47,834 --> 01:42:51,755
Let's find out if she is blind or not.

825
01:43:27,457 --> 01:43:30,960
- Is the sea all around us?
- Yes.

826
01:43:31,586 --> 01:43:33,546
No wonder there is so much breeze.

827
01:43:34,255 --> 01:43:36,675
Now, you just have to be in this breeze.

828
01:43:36,841 --> 01:43:37,926
What do you mean?

829
01:43:38,468 --> 01:43:41,096
Johny has bought this flat for you.

830
01:43:42,305 --> 01:43:45,225
Really? He never told me.

831
01:43:46,101 --> 01:43:49,437
Everything is not told in love,
it's understood. Come.

832
01:43:56,069 --> 01:43:58,071
Come, take a step.

833
01:43:58,947 --> 01:44:03,952
As soon as your leg reaches the floor,
you'll be in your own flat.

834
01:44:35,358 --> 01:44:36,067
Jyoti!

835
01:44:36,276 --> 01:44:36,943
What happened?

836
01:44:37,652 --> 01:44:40,405
You don't know what would have happened,
this heartless people...

837
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,699
Who heartless people?

838
01:44:43,241 --> 01:44:44,159
Johny and Rita!

839
01:44:44,868 --> 01:44:47,579
- They would have killed you.
- My life isn't that cheap, Johny.

840
01:44:48,872 --> 01:44:50,498
- What do you mean?
- I can see.

841
01:44:51,124 --> 01:44:53,084
And you are under arrest.

842
01:44:53,543 --> 01:44:54,502
You...

843
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:57,797
Yes, I'm police Inspector, Jyoti, Johny.

844
01:44:58,006 --> 01:44:58,673
Police?

845
01:44:59,341 --> 01:45:03,178
Tell me, tell me where the idol is, which
you robbed from the Krishna Voyage.

846
01:45:03,386 --> 01:45:04,220
Which idol?

847
01:45:04,471 --> 01:45:09,017
You don't have to lie, I saw you steal
the idol. I saw you myself.

848
01:45:09,684 --> 01:45:10,727
I didn't steal any idol!

849
01:45:11,102 --> 01:45:14,773
And Jyoti, I'm not Johny, I'm Gopi, Gopi!
And Johny,.. Come with me.

850
01:45:14,981 --> 01:45:17,025
See, look there, that's Johny.

851
01:45:21,654 --> 01:45:23,907
He's my look alike, he probably
robbed the idol.

852
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:26,826
Come with me.

853
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:37,796
Good, Inspectpor Jyoti.
even I reached on time.

854
01:45:37,921 --> 01:45:38,672
Come on, Mr. Johny.

855
01:45:39,005 --> 01:45:42,509
No, Mr. Chopra, he's not Johny, he's Gopi.
He's Johny's look alike.

856
01:45:42,801 --> 01:45:43,635
What are you saying?

857
01:45:43,927 --> 01:45:46,262
Yes, I have seen him go in the car.

858
01:45:46,846 --> 01:45:50,016
I think, while acting blind,
you became blind in love.

859
01:45:50,308 --> 01:45:54,270
And you want to save Johny? But we have
an aresst warant for Johny.

860
01:45:54,813 --> 01:45:57,941
Hey, they are arresting Johny!
Throw a smoke bomb.

861
01:46:00,568 --> 01:46:01,528
Arest them!

862
01:46:22,674 --> 01:46:24,092
Make sure he doesn't get away.

863
01:46:33,643 --> 01:46:35,645
Oh, so you helped him run away?

864
01:46:36,062 --> 01:46:36,688
What do you mean?

865
01:46:37,022 --> 01:46:38,231
The meaning is clear, Miss Jyoti.

866
01:46:38,857 --> 01:46:43,695
And I'm aressting you for the crime
of helping a criminal get away.

867
01:46:43,862 --> 01:46:46,031
Your allegation is absolutely baseless.

868
01:46:46,906 --> 01:46:48,283
Yet, let's go!

869
01:46:48,783 --> 01:46:52,871
- But first, I'll meet CBI officer Mr. Khan.
- Fine. Let's go.

870
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:59,794
What you are saying can
probably be the truth.

871
01:47:00,587 --> 01:47:01,796
But, Inspector Jyoti,..

872
01:47:02,339 --> 01:47:08,428
..you know well, that when we officers take a
case, we get to the bottom of every doubt...

873
01:47:08,970 --> 01:47:10,096
And then take a decision.

874
01:47:11,389 --> 01:47:16,353
even I can't let you work on this case,
until I get to the bottom of the allegations.

875
01:47:17,145 --> 01:47:18,646
For the time being, you are suspended.

876
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:20,523
You can get on with your enquiries.

877
01:47:21,232 --> 01:47:26,571
But even I'll prove it to you, that Johny
and Gopi are two different people!

878
01:47:38,583 --> 01:47:40,001
Come, Johny.

879
01:47:47,509 --> 01:47:51,805
Did you see how powerful
Supremo's security is?

880
01:47:52,514 --> 01:47:57,394
If our men wouldn't reach on
time, you'd be in jail.

881
01:47:59,562 --> 01:48:04,901
- And if the police found this idol,..
- Itr would be your second mistake, Johny.

882
01:48:06,611 --> 01:48:11,282
And you know the Supremo doesn't
forgive 2 mistakes.

883
01:48:12,409 --> 01:48:19,249
We can't wait too long, tomorrow at 10
we'll wait for the idol on the Hill top.

884
01:48:21,334 --> 01:48:22,877
This is your last chance.

885
01:48:28,508 --> 01:48:30,427
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.

886
01:48:31,011 --> 01:48:33,179
Johny is giving us the delivery
of the idol tomorrow.

887
01:48:33,638 --> 01:48:35,682
I had sent you his papers, did you get them?

888
01:48:35,765 --> 01:48:39,310
Yes, Dad. Johny? I know Johny quite well.

889
01:48:39,936 --> 01:48:41,354
His real name is Gopi.

890
01:48:41,771 --> 01:48:43,189
- Gopi?
- Yeah!

891
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:47,652
He worked in the canabbis fields of Ramgadh.

892
01:48:48,403 --> 01:48:49,154
That swine!

893
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,781
If you're still there, the
I'll come to Bombay.

894
01:48:52,323 --> 01:48:54,534
- Come.
- Okay, see you, Dad.

895
01:48:55,577 --> 01:48:56,619
Johny!

896
01:49:00,749 --> 01:49:03,668
You thief, gangster! Trecherous bastard!

897
01:49:04,085 --> 01:49:05,754
What do you mean?

898
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:15,805
Bastard! Where are the yields? Liar!

899
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:22,520
Gopi! What's wrong with you?

900
01:49:22,729 --> 01:49:26,316
You do illegal things and then say,
you're going to get rid of poverty!

901
01:49:26,566 --> 01:49:28,818
I swear to God! I'll kill you.

902
01:49:39,913 --> 01:49:42,999
JUst because I'm not hitting
you doesn't mean...

903
01:49:43,792 --> 01:49:45,168
..the meaning is just with the idol!

904
01:49:45,377 --> 01:49:46,961
Idol? What idol?

905
01:49:47,128 --> 01:49:49,214
What your supremo was asking for!

906
01:49:49,422 --> 01:49:50,090
Supremo?

907
01:50:02,435 --> 01:50:04,646
How could you rob from God!

908
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:10,026
I'm going to go report it to the police
and tell them about your deeds.

909
01:50:10,402 --> 01:50:14,864
Gopi? Do you want your grandma alive?

910
01:50:16,741 --> 01:50:17,492
Grandma?

911
01:50:24,207 --> 01:50:24,833
Yes.

912
01:50:29,546 --> 01:50:30,505
Look.

913
01:50:34,509 --> 01:50:35,385
Where is she?

914
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:43,768
She's okay until now. If you want her safe,
you have to do as I say.

915
01:50:44,686 --> 01:50:47,605
Now, tell me what did the supremo say.

916
01:50:48,189 --> 01:50:51,484
He will come at 10 at the hilltop to
take the idol.

917
01:50:55,155 --> 01:51:01,870
Rita, the Supremo himself is coming to take
the idol at 10 am tomorrow.

918
01:51:02,871 --> 01:51:07,792
I have made the arrangements.
And I'll reach the hilltop on time.

919
01:51:08,585 --> 01:51:08,918
Good.

920
01:52:00,470 --> 01:52:01,763
- Hello, Supremo.
- Hello.

921
01:52:05,183 --> 01:52:05,767
The key?

922
01:52:05,934 --> 01:52:09,896
Oh, I'm sorry. the key is in
my purse, I'll get it.

923
01:52:34,212 --> 01:52:38,091
You wait here, I'll get the ball.

924
01:53:26,931 --> 01:53:28,516
What happened, son? What is it?

925
01:53:29,017 --> 01:53:31,394
- Tell me, tell me?
- She, she...

926
01:53:31,853 --> 01:53:36,524
Don't be scared. Are you scared? Sit here.

927
01:53:38,777 --> 01:53:39,194
Hello?

928
01:53:40,153 --> 01:53:43,907
Johny? Raju, Gopi's son saw me put
Supremo's body in the trunk.

929
01:53:45,116 --> 01:53:45,950
What is Raju doing there?

930
01:53:46,910 --> 01:53:49,579
I don't know, he must have come there for
a school picnic.

931
01:53:49,788 --> 01:53:51,164
He's gone into someone's house here.

932
01:53:51,706 --> 01:53:53,124
Stay there, I'm coming.

933
01:53:57,087 --> 01:53:58,505
Here, child. Have some water.

934
01:54:01,091 --> 01:54:03,593
What is it, child? Why are you so scared?

935
01:54:04,177 --> 01:54:05,637
What is it? Is someone following you?

936
01:54:06,638 --> 01:54:09,099
In the jungle... car...

937
01:54:09,265 --> 01:54:10,892
Did you see a wild animal?

938
01:54:12,394 --> 01:54:13,144
In the car...

939
01:54:13,353 --> 01:54:14,562
- In the car? What?
- Son?

940
01:54:16,815 --> 01:54:17,649
Daddy!

941
01:54:18,483 --> 01:54:21,528
- Is this your son? He's scared, I believe.
- Yes, he is.

942
01:54:21,736 --> 01:54:24,364
I guess so too, anyway, thank you very much.

943
01:54:29,994 --> 01:54:35,375
She took the car back and dragged the
body and put the man in the trunk.

944
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:37,502
- Do you know?
- I know everything, Son.

945
01:54:42,924 --> 01:54:44,259
What happened, dad?

946
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:48,471
Nothing. You sit in the car, I'll...

947
01:54:52,976 --> 01:54:53,977
Is the body in the trunk?

948
01:54:54,894 --> 01:54:57,522
Leave the car for me, and take Raju.

949
01:55:19,336 --> 01:55:19,753
Gopi?

950
01:55:21,379 --> 01:55:27,135
Gopi! Gopi... Forgive me, Gopi.

951
01:55:29,262 --> 01:55:31,848
I cheated an innocent and nice man like you.

952
01:55:33,516 --> 01:55:37,062
I got you involved in bad things.
I'm an ass, a bastard.

953
01:55:40,357 --> 01:55:42,984
God gave me my karma, Gopi.

954
01:55:44,611 --> 01:55:46,488
I'm not going to live for long.

955
01:55:48,865 --> 01:55:49,824
What happened to you?

956
01:55:52,077 --> 01:55:52,869
Cancer.

957
01:55:56,790 --> 01:56:02,587
The doctor's given me 3 months max.

958
01:56:05,006 --> 01:56:08,885
Gopi, I know I'm not worth your forgiveness.

959
01:56:09,636 --> 01:56:13,306
Still, help me complete my last wish.

960
01:56:17,477 --> 01:56:21,481
Take this, take it. These are my house keys.

961
01:56:22,232 --> 01:56:25,902
All my property, all the money,
everything is yours.

962
01:56:26,653 --> 01:56:29,280
If you want, give it to the poor.

963
01:56:32,283 --> 01:56:37,038
This world is now alien to me.

964
01:56:37,664 --> 01:56:38,039
Johny?

965
01:56:41,418 --> 01:56:47,173
And your grandma, is in a cottage at
Madh Island, it's called Kamal Kunj.

966
01:56:47,757 --> 01:56:50,719
Tell her... Touch her feet for me.

967
01:56:50,927 --> 01:56:51,886
And...

968
01:56:52,429 --> 01:56:54,681
Cottage? Kamal Kunj?

969
01:56:55,598 --> 01:56:58,059
But Johny, you need to see a good doctor.

970
01:56:59,728 --> 01:57:02,313
The best doctor, is God, Gopi.

971
01:57:02,605 --> 01:57:03,440
Since...

972
01:57:06,276 --> 01:57:07,444
What happened?

973
01:57:07,819 --> 01:57:12,407
Nothing. I'm reaping what I sowed.

974
01:57:13,992 --> 01:57:16,745
Grandma is dying to see you.

975
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:21,124
Go, take my car.

976
01:57:22,167 --> 01:57:23,209
What about you?

977
01:57:23,835 --> 01:57:26,087
Don't worry about me, go!

978
01:57:27,756 --> 01:57:28,548
Go!

979
01:57:49,194 --> 01:57:50,028
- Gopi!
- Grandma?

980
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:54,741
- Gopi! My son.
- Grandma?

981
01:57:55,283 --> 01:57:57,535
Gopi! Where had you gone?

982
01:57:57,744 --> 01:57:58,912
Forgive me, Grandma.

983
01:58:00,663 --> 01:58:01,664
What have you done?

984
01:58:02,374 --> 01:58:04,417
I came here to complete my goals.

985
01:58:05,001 --> 01:58:10,298
But what I thought would help me,
turned out to be a viscious deed.

986
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:12,467
Did you do anything wrong?

987
01:58:12,801 --> 01:58:16,638
No, no, grandma. I swear to you I wouldn't.
I'll die but do anything wrong.

988
01:58:16,721 --> 01:58:18,515
- We are going back... just come.
- Why?

989
01:58:19,808 --> 01:58:20,809
Sit.

990
01:58:33,571 --> 01:58:35,740
- We need to search your car.
- Why?

991
01:58:35,782 --> 01:58:38,576
We have been told, you have murdered a man.

992
01:58:39,327 --> 01:58:39,994
What is this you're saying!

993
01:58:40,662 --> 01:58:41,788
Could you give me the car keys?

994
01:58:52,257 --> 01:58:53,383
What happened, son?

995
01:58:54,884 --> 01:58:56,970
Nothing, Grandma. They have a doubt...

996
01:59:00,223 --> 01:59:04,102
No! Ididn't do this. I didn't murder
anyone, Grandma.

997
01:59:04,853 --> 01:59:10,859
Sinster! Murderer! You told me you don't
do anything wrong! What is this?

998
01:59:11,067 --> 01:59:14,154
- I haven't done this, really.
- You bad person! Tell me the truth!

999
01:59:14,362 --> 01:59:18,575
Why did you do this murder? No!
My son can't be a murderer.

1000
01:59:18,783 --> 01:59:22,037
My son can't be a murderer! Tell me!

1001
01:59:22,245 --> 01:59:23,913
Grandma, I didn't do it.

1002
01:59:24,122 --> 01:59:28,668
I didn't do it! I swear I haven't done this.

1003
01:59:28,877 --> 01:59:36,051
I'm not a murderer, grandma! I didn't do it.
I'll prove it! I'm not a murderer.

1004
01:59:41,264 --> 01:59:43,975
Stop the car, there's dynamite ahead.

1005
02:00:38,154 --> 02:00:41,616
Why? are you shocked at seeing me alive?

1006
02:00:42,075 --> 02:00:45,120
Bastard! You sent a bomb instead of the idol!

1007
02:00:46,413 --> 02:00:47,205
Where is the idol?

1008
02:00:50,792 --> 02:00:55,005
The idol is not with me, it must be
with Johny. I'm not Johny, I'm Gopi.

1009
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:56,381
I'm Johny's look alike.

1010
02:00:56,589 --> 02:00:58,174
Don't you recognize me?

1011
02:00:58,383 --> 02:01:02,137
Yeah, I know you well. You're Gopi!

1012
02:01:02,345 --> 02:01:04,055
And you are Johny too!

1013
02:01:05,724 --> 02:01:07,017
Tell us where the idol is!

1014
02:01:08,601 --> 02:01:10,103
I don't have the idol.

1015
02:01:12,230 --> 02:01:13,481
At least listenb to me.

1016
02:01:24,951 --> 02:01:26,578
I really don't have the Idol.

1017
02:01:26,786 --> 02:01:28,413
If you want it catch Johny!

1018
02:01:33,376 --> 02:01:38,506
You can always kill me, I'm your prisoner!
But at least look for johny!

1019
02:01:38,715 --> 02:01:40,342
You are lying!

1020
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,093
I'm not lying!

1021
02:01:52,854 --> 02:01:57,484
Monty, it's possible that
he's saying the truth.

1022
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:01,905
What if Johny is another man?
Go look for him!

1023
02:02:18,755 --> 02:02:21,007
Rita! We are leaving the
country, right away.

1024
02:02:21,216 --> 02:02:22,550
- Where's the kid?
- Inside.

1025
02:02:24,302 --> 02:02:28,598
Listen, the police is after us. Remove
everything from the locker and the idol and wait.

1026
02:02:29,933 --> 02:02:31,643
I'll take care of this child in the meanwhile.

1027
02:02:31,851 --> 02:02:32,727
- Okay.
- Go!

1028
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:59,004
Dad, where had you gone? Open all this.
Rita aunty tied me up.

1029
02:02:59,546 --> 02:03:01,631
I'm untying you, son.

1030
02:03:23,528 --> 02:03:26,990
This photo? How did it get here?

1031
02:03:27,198 --> 02:03:30,326
I had kept it there, dad.

1032
02:03:30,535 --> 02:03:31,244
You?

1033
02:03:32,829 --> 02:03:33,747
Where did you get this?

1034
02:03:33,955 --> 02:03:35,582
Mom gave it to me.

1035
02:03:35,957 --> 02:03:36,624
Your mother?

1036
02:03:37,208 --> 02:03:41,004
Yes, dad. She had said that's my dad.

1037
02:03:41,546 --> 02:03:44,424
She said, "find him". And then she died.

1038
02:03:44,632 --> 02:03:45,383
Son...

1039
02:03:45,592 --> 02:03:48,762
Yes, dad. She would always think of you.

1040
02:03:52,432 --> 02:03:53,433
My son?

1041
02:03:56,770 --> 02:03:57,270
Son...

1042
02:04:05,945 --> 02:04:06,863
My son...

1043
02:04:14,621 --> 02:04:18,667
- Dad!
- God saved me, my son.

1044
02:04:19,709 --> 02:04:22,170
Or else I'd have killed my own blood.

1045
02:04:25,548 --> 02:04:28,968
Johny! We've looked for you everywhere!

1046
02:04:29,594 --> 02:04:31,513
Surrender yourself!

1047
02:04:47,570 --> 02:04:48,947
Take the kid too!

1048
02:05:04,337 --> 02:05:06,923
Come, come. Take a step.

1049
02:05:08,133 --> 02:05:12,220
As soon as your feet touch the ground,
you'll be in your flat.

1050
02:05:18,518 --> 02:05:22,939
Let me take you to your new flat,
I mean, a jail cell.

1051
02:05:24,024 --> 02:05:26,276
Miss Rita, you are under arest.

1052
02:05:26,985 --> 02:05:29,404
Give me the idol, and come with me.

1053
02:05:29,738 --> 02:05:32,032
Stop! Or else I'll shoot.

1054
02:05:33,491 --> 02:05:36,703
Along with Johny you have fooled
the police enough!

1055
02:05:37,787 --> 02:05:41,166
Your under arest along with my evidence.

1056
02:06:09,527 --> 02:06:10,028
Johny?

1057
02:06:11,237 --> 02:06:14,699
Johny? I'm not Johny! I'm Gopi.

1058
02:06:15,700 --> 02:06:17,202
Tell me where the idol is!

1059
02:06:18,828 --> 02:06:21,498
I don't have the idol, it must be with Johny.

1060
02:06:22,707 --> 02:06:25,794
Bugs, this dog isn't going to answer
like this! Hang him.

1061
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:30,131
But I'm Gopi,...

1062
02:06:30,256 --> 02:06:32,175
We'll know who Johny is in minutes!

1063
02:06:36,763 --> 02:06:38,556
At least listen to me.

1064
02:06:43,937 --> 02:06:49,317
Listen, you'll are mistaken. I'm not Johny,
he is Johny.

1065
02:06:49,943 --> 02:06:50,985
He's lying.

1066
02:06:58,118 --> 02:07:02,706
You want to leave your deed on me?
You have made me sin too!

1067
02:07:02,872 --> 02:07:06,668
Don't believe him! He's Johny, I'm Gopi!

1068
02:07:08,128 --> 02:07:10,964
I have a way to know who's who.

1069
02:07:15,010 --> 02:07:15,844
Grandma?

1070
02:07:23,977 --> 02:07:27,188
Tell me, Old lady! Which one is your Gopi?

1071
02:07:28,982 --> 02:07:34,237
What do you think? My Grandma
won't recognize me?

1072
02:07:34,654 --> 02:07:37,782
Grandma! I'm your Gopi.

1073
02:07:37,991 --> 02:07:40,744
See Grandma, see how they are hitting me.

1074
02:07:40,952 --> 02:07:46,249
Grandma, I'm your Gopi! Not him.
He's a thief!

1075
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:48,918
I'm not lyimg!

1076
02:07:51,463 --> 02:07:58,053
Supremo! Johny is your enemy, why have you
abducted my grandma?

1077
02:07:58,261 --> 02:08:04,309
She is here because, she is the grandmother
to one of you two.

1078
02:08:07,687 --> 02:08:09,314
Throw the old lady in the water!

1079
02:08:09,522 --> 02:08:12,359
Throw the child too.

1080
02:08:12,567 --> 02:08:15,236
- No!
- Dad, dad, save me!

1081
02:08:15,445 --> 02:08:18,031
- Wait!
- Dad, save me, dad!

1082
02:08:18,865 --> 02:08:19,991
I'll tell you.

1083
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:24,829
Leave my son alone, Supremo, I'll tell you.

1084
02:08:26,498 --> 02:08:27,874
The idol is with Rita.

1085
02:08:28,083 --> 02:08:30,835
Call her, you will get the idol.

1086
02:08:34,673 --> 02:08:35,715
Pick up the phone.

1087
02:08:38,635 --> 02:08:39,302
Is that you, Johny?

1088
02:08:39,886 --> 02:08:43,431
- Rita, we are caught by Supremo.
- Hello?

1089
02:08:43,640 --> 02:08:47,811
Rita, we have both the Johny's with us.

1090
02:08:47,977 --> 02:08:52,899
Get the idol here within an hour
or we'll kill both of them!

1091
02:08:53,149 --> 02:08:55,276
Aren't you in love with Johny?

1092
02:08:55,985 --> 02:08:57,195
Love?

1093
02:08:57,529 --> 02:09:03,535
Supremo, money is love in our business,
right now, I'm in love with the idol.

1094
02:09:04,202 --> 02:09:06,121
Shoot Johny an extra bullet for me.

1095
02:09:06,830 --> 02:09:12,085
Hello? You won't be able to get the right
price for the idol, it's not easy to sell it.

1096
02:09:12,377 --> 02:09:14,963
I'll gie you any price for te idol!

1097
02:09:15,171 --> 02:09:16,756
Stay there, I'm coming myself!

1098
02:09:18,508 --> 02:09:22,637
No! There's police everywhere. You keep
the money ready, I'm coming.

1099
02:09:23,013 --> 02:09:24,764
Okay, reach Lake Valley soon!

1100
02:09:27,475 --> 02:09:28,852
Was that the Supremo?

1101
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:31,021
Yes, they have Gopi too.

1102
02:09:31,354 --> 02:09:34,107
Now, tell me if you want to see Gopi alive?

1103
02:09:35,775 --> 02:09:36,526
Gopi...

1104
02:09:39,154 --> 02:09:41,364
Dad? Rita is not here yet.

1105
02:09:42,198 --> 02:09:43,825
Let's wait for a while.

1106
02:10:12,562 --> 02:10:13,855
Which one of you is Rita?

1107
02:10:14,147 --> 02:10:16,566
- Me.
- And I'm Jyoti.

1108
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:18,985
Who has the idol?

1109
02:10:19,235 --> 02:10:20,070
We do.

1110
02:10:20,987 --> 02:10:21,654
Where is it?

1111
02:10:23,490 --> 02:10:24,991
We have not come to give the idol.

1112
02:10:25,450 --> 02:10:26,826
We've come here to bid for it.

1113
02:10:27,827 --> 02:10:28,453
What bid?

1114
02:10:31,164 --> 02:10:32,916
We want the right price for the idol.

1115
02:10:33,458 --> 02:10:38,922
Do you want them alive or
the price for the idol?

1116
02:10:39,839 --> 02:10:41,007
Price for the idol.

1117
02:10:41,758 --> 02:10:44,511
- Rita give the Supremo the idol!
- Shut up!

1118
02:10:44,552 --> 02:10:45,053
Rita!

1119
02:10:45,595 --> 02:10:49,766
Who do you think you are?
You treacherous bastard!

1120
02:10:49,974 --> 02:10:53,269
Taking advantage of your faces,
you'll played with our honor!

1121
02:10:53,603 --> 02:10:54,813
Now, wait and watch.

1122
02:10:56,648 --> 02:11:01,778
Supremo, we'll bid for the idol,
on their dead bodies.

1123
02:11:29,222 --> 02:11:30,682
Throw your guns away!

1124
02:11:38,982 --> 02:11:41,109
Bitch! You think you can cheat us?

1125
02:11:43,403 --> 02:11:45,989
Look for those two, Gopi and Johny!

1126
02:11:49,576 --> 02:11:54,372
Gopi yo take care of these guys,
I'll take care of the cost gaurds.

1127
02:11:55,957 --> 02:12:00,295
Search every corner, don't let them get away!

1128
02:13:27,799 --> 02:13:31,136
Hit him hard! Put your strength to it!

1129
02:13:31,344 --> 02:13:33,555
Climb up, climb on his chest!

1130
02:13:33,638 --> 02:13:36,891
Hit him, Kick him hard!

1131
02:14:09,799 --> 02:14:11,051
You Bastard!

1132
02:15:41,016 --> 02:15:42,600
Remember that day, Monty?

1133
02:15:44,811 --> 02:15:50,066
When you whipped me in the village without
any fault of mine and hurt my grandma.

1134
02:15:50,775 --> 02:15:52,736
I swore to grandma that day.

1135
02:15:53,528 --> 02:15:57,407
That one day I'll havce the whip
and you on the floor.

1136
02:15:59,159 --> 02:16:00,285
Today is that day.

1137
02:16:48,041 --> 02:16:49,417
Put down your weapons!

1138
02:16:49,918 --> 02:16:51,586
And walk back.

1139
02:17:10,021 --> 02:17:14,442
Mr. Johny, hadn't I said, one day
you'll see my targets too.

1140
02:17:15,443 --> 02:17:17,654
You are under arrest. Come on.

1141
02:17:22,033 --> 02:17:22,742
Dad?

1142
02:17:24,661 --> 02:17:25,245
Dad?

1143
02:17:27,122 --> 02:17:32,961
Dad? Dad? Dad, if you go, what will
happen to me? Take me with you.

1144
02:17:36,256 --> 02:17:37,549
Come on, Mr. Johny.

1145
02:17:39,884 --> 02:17:44,389
Inspector, you're forgeting again.
This isn't johny, I'm Johny.

1146
02:17:48,893 --> 02:17:54,941
No, Gopi. I'm already indebted to you.

1147
02:17:56,317 --> 02:17:57,569
Do me just one more favor.

1148
02:18:02,490 --> 02:18:07,996
Keep Raju with you, until I return.

1149
02:18:09,622 --> 02:18:12,834
Raju is our child, he'll stay with us.

1150
02:18:13,877 --> 02:18:15,587
Raju? Will you live with us?

1151
02:18:15,670 --> 02:18:17,172
On one condition.

1152
02:18:17,505 --> 02:18:23,053
After dad returns, you will stay together,
'Aamne Saamne'!
