STORIES THAT HUMANISE LIFE

3
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:22,040
Hello, Delhi!

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,040
It's eight o'clock on Monday
and we're all off to work.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,680
The traffic is terrible.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,240
But of course, darling,
this is NCR's Delhi.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,880
If you're stuck in your car making lists

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,840
of the battles you're fighting this week

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,680
with your rivals, colleagues and clients,

10
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,320
there must be a little thought,

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,080
in some corner of your mind,

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,000
wondering why Sunday ended at all.

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,720
Man, why did I leave the house at all?

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,200
I could be curled up in bed,
doing nothing.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,840
After all, there's no place like home.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,720
What are you waiting for? Get started.

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,440
Day 279.

18
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,440
Thank you.

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,880
Eight o'clock tomorrow.

20
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,480
-Hey, handsome.
-JD.

21
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Guess where I am.

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,840
You got some girl wasted last night

23
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,040
and took her home.

24
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,440
Firstly, she invited me to her house.

25
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,560
Secondly, she wasn't drunk.

26
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,840
What do you think I am?

27
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,040
Where do I start?

28
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,920
I don't need to force girls
to sleep with me, got it?

29
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,240
You know
you're headed for trouble, don't you?

30
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,640
I will see all your scandals
in the media one day.

31
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,320
Screenshots, photos...

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,280
What will you see, bro?
You're a traitor to millennials.

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,320
You never reply to my messages.

34
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,560
Your dumbass rule...

35
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,680
"Take all bloody phone calls."

36
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,440
Get out of the 1800s, move on.

37
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,480
The day I break my rules,

38
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
you will be the first one
whose calls I will reject.

39
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,400
Until then, listen to me.

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,080
An amazing idea came to me last night

41
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,480
and it's still stuck in my head.

42
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,360
-You and I, partners. Okay?
-No.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Dude...

44
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,560
-No.
-Love of my life, get serious.

45
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,200
How long
will this crazy house arrest last?

46
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,839
You've been locked inside the house
for six months now.

47
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Come on. Get out today.

48
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,800
Let's meet for lunch.

49
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,079
I'll explain the idea.

50
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,920
-No.
-Bro, dude, this is not...

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,480
This is not normal, okay?

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,040
You have a mental problem.

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,920
I agree what happened was not--

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,920
JD! JD. I don't want to leave the house.

55
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,200
That's it. We've been over this.

56
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,120
The Karan I knew from class four
was a happy super-achiever

57
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,360
who could not be...

58
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,160
made to go home.

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,360
And now you've locked yourself up
at home for six months,

60
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,080
-rotting away like an idiot.
-Don't you get tired of talking?

61
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,760
Guys usually sleep
after having sex. Sleep.

62
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,160
Bye. Deepa...

63
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,480
Karan, baby, I know you are in there.
Open up.

64
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Come on.

65
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,000
-Pinky, hi.
-Hi, darling!

66
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,920
-Listen, Karan. You're my friend, right?
-Yes, sure.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Exactly. That's what I told Daddy.

68
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,480
"Dad, don't worry, dude.
Karan upstairs... he's really sweet.

69
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,080
Forget him trying to touch me,

70
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,080
he doesn't even look at me like that.

71
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
Yes, maybe he's gay." You know, it's not
easy to guess these days, right?

72
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
You told your father that?

73
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,400
Yeah. And you know what Daddy said?

74
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,240
Daddy said, "Listen, dear Pinky."

75
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,840
He calls me "dear."

76
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,960
So sweet, no?

77
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Yes, very.

78
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,120
So Daddy said, "Dear Pinky,
I know, these boys are all the same -

79
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,000
you ask them for help,
and they want something in return."

80
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,360
So, I said, "Oh, God, Daddy, please...
It's not like that, okay?"

81
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,000
I didn't tell Daddy
that girls also want the same thing.

82
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,600
So, what's the problem, right?

83
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,680
Good, you didn't tell him, but--

84
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,240
I also told him, "Listen, Daddy,

85
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,200
don't talk too much
while sitting in Dubai, okay?

86
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,480
You don't know Karan.

87
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,240
He is really, really sweet
and he will understand."

88
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,520
What will he understand?

89
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,040
Okay, listen, darling.

90
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,640
Remember I told you
that Dad is a big businessman?

91
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,080
Don. He is actually a very big don.

92
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,200
Oh, I told you.

93
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,120
But he is a big sweetheart.

94
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,560
-He's damn sweet.
-Very good for him, but...

95
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
What do you want, Pinky?

96
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,120
There's a package.
I will leave it at your house, okay?

97
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,440
You're always at home.

98
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,040
You never step out
and neither does anyone come here.

99
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,160
So... Sit.

100
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,680
Package?

101
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,640
Yeah. I have to attend a wedding today,

102
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,520
so my cousins will come home to get ready.

103
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,120
So I can't keep it at home.

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
If anyone sees,
it will spoil the surprise.

105
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,760
So, you keep it, okay? Thank you.

106
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,120
No...

107
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,360
I don't know, Pinky.

108
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm prepared to give you anything. Money?

109
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,680
-No.
-Okay.

110
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,400
-No... What are you doing?
-Sex?

111
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,440
-No, no.
-I'm very good. It's your lucky day.

112
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,000
-It's not my day.
-Rambo!

113
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,840
I didn't introduce you to Rambo.

114
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,080
He's my bodyguard.

115
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,040
Dad has asked him
not to leave me alone with any guy,

116
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,720
so, Rambo will be here.

117
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,320
Rambo baby, face that way, please. Turn.

118
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,000
Perfect.

119
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,480
-Let's go.
-What are you doing?

120
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,000
I will keep the package.

121
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,960
I'll keep it.

122
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,640
Please...

123
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,680
Are you turning me down?

124
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,960
No.

125
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,440
I don't know Rambo well enough.

126
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,600
You're so weird, baby.

127
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,520
You are not normal. You know that, right?

128
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,640
Anyway, thank you so much. Bye, okay?

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,200
Rambo. Baby, come, let's go.

130
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,240
I can draw eyes on you.

131
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,720
I am not normal.

132
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
And if I am normal...

133
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,320
He's the abnormal one.

134
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,000
Hey, handsome.

135
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,240
What's up?

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,400
I'm wondering why I ever thought
I could find peace at home.

137
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
Yeah, so listen...

138
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,720
-No.
-Because I'm going to enrich your life.

139
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,320
There's a journalist...

140
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,760
A mutual friend was telling her about you,

141
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,640
that you don't step out of the house.

142
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,960
When he said that you haven't stepped out
in six months, she was amazed.

143
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,520
Of course, I did add
that you're a bit psycho,

144
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,840
that you talk to yourself
and dance around naked.

145
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,360
Thanks, JD.

146
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,760
Now, she is really interested
in meeting you.

147
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,960
She was chatting away...

148
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,360
about this being a new trend -

149
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,280
urban isolation.

150
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,760
Your favorite theme - solitude.

151
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,520
There's a name for it in Japan...

152
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,360
The "Hakuna Matata" type.

153
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,680
-No.
-Fuck!

154
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,080
JD.

155
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,640
She really wants to meet you.

156
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,680
And because I'm your best friend,
what did I do?

157
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,640
-JD, you didn't give her my number...
-Your address, too. Meet her, man.

158
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,960
You won't let me in - that's fine.

159
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,280
-But meet this girl.
-No.

160
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,400
-No...
-Her name is Saira.

161
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,800
-JD.
-She'll call you.

162
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,360
-I don't want to meet her.
-Shut up.

163
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,920
Why is delivering a beautiful girl
to your home a problem?

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Because I'm not interested. Say no, buddy.

165
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,840
Boss, I shouldn't be telling you this,

166
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,680
but if she doesn't get this story,
she'll lose her job.

167
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,880
-I don't care.
-Her blood is on your hands.

168
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,680
I don't... I don't want to. Bye.

169
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,000
You motherfucker...

170
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,080
Hello, sir. Your supplies...

171
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,560
Shall I cook for you?

172
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,040
No, I'll cook myself.

173
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,880
-Mashed eggplant maybe?
-No, I've got eggs and bread.

174
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,040
Sir, shall I clean the house?

175
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,080
No, that's not necessary.

176
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,480
-Thank you.
-Okay, sir.

177
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,200
Hi, is that Karan?

178
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
That depends...

179
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,720
Hi, this is Saira.
I got your number from JD.

180
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,560
-Jamshed Daneja?
-Oh...

181
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,840
Boss, let me make one thing very clear.

182
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,440
I'm not a hermit or a samurai.

183
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,600
No. Of course.

184
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,800
Well, I heard you watched
your car get stolen,

185
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,320
yet you didn't step out of the house.

186
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,800
I called the police, okay? I'm not crazy.

187
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,240
That's not what I'm implying.

188
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,400
I'm actually researching
the Japanese concept, Hikikomori,

189
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,160
to see if it's happening in India.

190
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,720
"Hikiki" what?

191
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
Hikikomori.

192
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,040
Millions of Japanese people -
usually boys, usually young -

193
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,880
shut themselves up in their rooms.

194
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,600
You know, just shut-ins,
rejecting society.

195
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,520
They are busy with their gadgets,
you know, just online.

196
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,560
Zero physical social contact.

197
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,080
You've been doing something similar
for six months, right?

198
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,120
So, let's meet.

199
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,880
Yes... No. Look, I don't want
to be in the papers or on TV, please.

200
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,440
No, relax.
I don't work in TV or for a newspaper.

201
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,000
If I cause you any trouble,
then I'll leave.

202
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,280
But what you do is really interesting.

203
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
-Madam, it's not interesting--
-Tomorrow?

204
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,000
Tomorrow? Please don't say no.

205
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,480
Look, I don't usually allow anyone in.

206
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,640
Okay, that's very sweet of you.

207
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,200
Thanks. Great. So, Tuesday morning, then.
Eleven o'clock.

208
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,160
Is tomorrow Tuesday?

209
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,120
Yes.

210
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,880
I have your address.
I'll see you, Karan. Bye.

211
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,040
Hello?

212
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,160
Okay. Thanks a lot, baby.

213
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,000
-What... What is this?
-The package.

214
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,760
You told me you would keep it.

215
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,000
But...

216
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,720
A package, yes, but what is this?

217
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,520
This is a fridge.

218
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,480
I can't have this
in my living room all day.

219
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,400
Rambo.

220
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,640
Stupid Rambo. Go put it inside.

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,920
Come, I'll show you.

222
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,320
No. Inside... No. Inside?

223
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,480
Hello?

224
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,840
Hey... hey, bro.

225
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,080
Hey! Ram, bro...

226
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
Hello... hey!

227
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,520
Yes, let's put it here.

228
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,680
Gurmeet Kaur.

229
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,840
This is a package. I'm not Gurmeet Kaur.

230
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,240
Could be your wife.

231
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,720
-No.
-Sir, who are you?

232
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,000
Whoever, but not Gurmeet Kaur!

233
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,960
Where is she? When will she come?

234
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,320
I don't know.

235
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,880
Sir, do this -
take the package and sign, please.

236
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,000
Rambo, I told you to fix the lock.
Put him inside.

237
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,280
Hurry up.

238
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,440
Sign, please. You must, sir.

239
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,560
-No.
-Sir...

240
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,080
What... What is this?

241
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,280
What is this? What's in there?

242
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,640
It's a bag, baby.

243
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,800
Body.

244
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,200
Body.

245
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,120
Okay, fine.
At least it's a package, right?

246
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,960
-He was trying to kidnap me.
-So, you gift-wrapped him?

247
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,240
No... You can't keep him here, bro. Bro.

248
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,000
Actually, you know what?

249
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,840
Daddy's enemies - "businessmen" -

250
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,160
are always trying to kill me or kidnap me.

251
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,200
That's why I have Rambo.

252
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,200
-But...
-He broke into my room today.

253
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,600
But Rambo was sleeping there.

254
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,560
You see, I have a king-sized bed.

255
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,120
So, Rambo sleeps in my room,
and I sleep in his room.

256
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,120
So, he hit poor Rambo on the head.

257
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,640
And Rambo didn't like that.

258
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,160
Yeah. So... Very good.

259
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,000
But you can't keep this here. Please.

260
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,520
Baby, I have to go to a wedding
and I have shopping to do.

261
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
My cousins are coming.
Remember? I told you.

262
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,480
Where can I keep it?

263
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,000
Anywhere else, but not here.

264
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,000
Rambo, put him down.

265
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,000
Pinky, I live here.

266
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
I can't spend all day with a corpse.

267
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,960
This is why I offered you sex, right?

268
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,240
Rambo, you turn around. And you come here.

269
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,359
Wait... Wait a minute.
I can't do this. Please.

270
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,520
It's okay, baby.

271
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,640
No problem.

272
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,680
I offered, you refused.

273
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,800
It's okay.

274
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,760
Rambo will pick it up
in the evening, okay?

275
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,040
Bye, baby.

276
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,560
Oh, yeah. One more thing...

277
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,440
You must keep this package safe.

278
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,400
Because I love you, and all,

279
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,400
but if something goes wrong
with the package...

280
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,760
You know Rambo, right?

281
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,360
He just kills people.

282
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
Understood, no? Bye.

283
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,120
Baby, come. Let's go.

284
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,240
Hey, Karan. Saira again.

285
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,280
Hey!

286
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,440
Hi, listen. What are you up to now?

287
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,840
Nothing.

288
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,080
Okay, so, what are your plans for the day?

289
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,920
Are people coming over?
Do people visit? No, right?

290
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,800
No. Nothing is going on here.

291
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,320
-Generally, I don't meet people.
-Okay, great.

292
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,720
So, if you don't mind, can we meet now?

293
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,440
Because my meeting got shifted.
So, I'm free, too.

294
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,080
Fantastic. I'm right around the corner.

295
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,240
What? No, no!

296
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,880
Relax, Karan. It's going to be painless.

297
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,680
I'll see you. Bye.

298
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,480
No, no... Hello?

299
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,840
Is he alive?

300
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,680
Madam...

301
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,840
please sign in.

302
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,040
It's compulsory.

303
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,360
Sorry.

304
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,560
Hello?

305
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,320
Hello?

306
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,400
Hello?

307
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,440
Hello?

308
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,560
Hi.

309
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,760
Hi.

310
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,880
-Saira.
-Karan.

311
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,080
I hope it wasn't difficult
to find the house.

312
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
No, I followed the map.

313
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,120
-Coffee?
-Sure.

314
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,000
Come.

315
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,840
Sit.

316
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,000
Sit.

317
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,240
Wow.

318
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,080
This is a really nice house.

319
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,000
Dude, Hikikomori dens should be like this.

320
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,440
-I'll get coffee.
-Sure.

321
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,080
AVOID: REACHED?

322
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,960
Saira, coffee.

323
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Thank you.

324
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,960
So, I'll start with the obvious question.

325
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,080
When did you decide
to stay indoors, and why?

326
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,400
I guess I needed a break.

327
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,000
I was a banker.

328
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,080
So, the bank was the problem?

329
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,400
Promotions, responsibilities, ambitions...

330
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,440
I spent my whole life...

331
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,520
and all my time trying to plan this house.

332
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,600
I didn't actually spend any time in it.

333
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,960
Normally, people call that success.

334
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,480
Some people figure it out early
and others, late.

335
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,760
Everyone...

336
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,160
thinks...

337
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,680
"I'll earn this much and retire."

338
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,760
But that target keeps increasing.

339
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,720
You attend meeting after meeting,
make Excel spreadsheets, analyze them...

340
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,640
You look up and six years are gone.

341
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,280
And just to be clear,
you never leave the house?

342
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,920
Like, not even to get cigarettes.

343
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,920
I don't smoke.

344
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,080
Cash? I mean, you need money.

345
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,560
Yes. The watchman gets it.

346
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,840
Trusting...

347
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay, I can't think of anything else.
What if there's a fire?

348
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,320
Obviously...

349
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,320
A friend's emergency?

350
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,560
Of course. But it's better
if you don't curse my future.

351
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Sure.

352
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,640
What about elections?

353
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,040
You don't seem the voting type, though.

354
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,560
The next election is far away.

355
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,200
I'll vote next time.

356
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,120
Look, I'm okay staying in.

357
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,240
I trade stocks and do Skype consulting.
It's no big deal.

358
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,760
So...

359
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,040
Can I see your home?

360
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,440
For the story, of course.

361
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,920
Yeah.

362
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
Yeah.

363
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,760
Great.

364
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,040
How is...

365
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,280
It's really pretty.

366
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,160
Thank you.

367
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,320
I got it from Burma.

368
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,800
And... mathematical stuff...

369
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,680
That's my room. And...

370
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,480
Bedroom.

371
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,840
Nice.

372
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,360
-This is a really nice place, Karan.
-Thank you.

373
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,800
Much cleaner than mine.

374
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,560
-Shall we go?
-Okay.

375
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,200
Did a short man enter the building?
He's short.

376
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
Height is not noted in the register.

377
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,720
Was he in there? Let's check.

378
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,080
Sign in first.

379
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,080
Let's go.

380
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Thank you.

381
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Your bot cleans the house all by itself?

382
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,200
With no help?

383
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,200
Robert is a smart maid.

384
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,920
KHALEESI: AK PUSHED TO FRI

385
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,960
Oh, damn.

386
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,840
My next meeting has been canceled.

387
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,240
Come on.

388
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,480
Let's continue the interview outside,
over lunch.

389
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,600
Come on.

390
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,480
You'll have to step out someday.

391
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,200
And I'm slightly hungry.

392
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,720
Nice try.

393
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,360
But I would freeze at the door.

394
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,440
I'm fine at home.

395
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,400
Like I said, no big deal.

396
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,200
If it's no big deal, then let's go.

397
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,280
If you don't like it,
stay in for another six months. Okay?

398
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,240
No.

399
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,440
Why?

400
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,720
It would ruin your story.

401
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,160
-Nicely done.
-Thanks.

402
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,000
You know, the worst part
is that I totally get it.

403
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,360
The office, this city, the pollution...

404
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,840
the men...

405
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,280
You know, honestly,

406
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,960
I've always dreamt of taking a year off

407
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,920
to do nothing.

408
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,680
Rather, do nothing.

409
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,080
Just cut myself off from everything
and everyone.

410
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Just be by myself.

411
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,720
If you don't meet people,
there's no stress,

412
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,480
no confusion, no miscommunication,

413
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,280
no scope for cheating...

414
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,200
You should do it.

415
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,480
Sure.

416
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,560
If I could afford it, I would.

417
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,120
You know, when I heard about you,

418
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,320
I decided I'd meet you
and uncover all your secrets,

419
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,880
so I could try it myself.

420
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,200
But your secret is clear.

421
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,640
You're loaded, boss.

422
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,080
You have everything.
You can do whatever you like.

423
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,680
So, you figured it out?

424
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,720
The interview is over?

425
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,600
Did it even start?

426
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,360
You distracted me by listening
to my Hikikomori story.

427
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,320
Don't do that. I get to ask the questions.

428
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,480
Fine, noted.

429
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,840
You ask the questions and...

430
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,120
I can serve you lunch.

431
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,960
You're hungry. You can eat here.

432
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,160
You'll also see what I can cook at home...

433
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,640
what I've learnt.

434
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,240
You know, stuff like that.

435
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,360
If something happens to this package...
You know Rambo, right?

436
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,400
Can I help?

437
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,960
No. Why? No.

438
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,440
No, I'm good.

439
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,840
Okay.

440
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,800
Thank you. Will you excuse me?

441
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,800
Robert...

442
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,720
don't you cook?

443
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,120
Pinky, pick up, pick up. Pinky.

444
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,720
Fuck!

445
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,880
-I'll just...
-Oh, sorry.

446
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,360
Salary?

447
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,960
Oh, yes. Salary.

448
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,960
-Did you wash the car?
-Yes.

449
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,600
-Did you start the engine?
-Yes.

450
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,160
Here, 800 rupees. The car is fine, right?

451
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,600
Yes, sir. Sir, here...

452
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,800
Your keys.

453
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,360
I got a new job as a driver.
I start tomorrow.

454
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,080
You drive?

455
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,960
I learned with your car, sir.

456
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,040
That Mukesh...
Mukesh is the new watchman.

457
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,760
He'll come from tomorrow to wash the car.

458
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,640
Don't give him your ATM card yet, sir.

459
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,520
He's new.

460
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,440
Yes.

461
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,360
-All the best.
-Thank you, sir.

462
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,240
-Go.
-I'll go now, sir.

463
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,280
So, you're okay with all this?

464
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,960
Yes, why?

465
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,200
He's a nice guy.

466
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,320
He's progressing.

467
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,440
He is much better than the last guy was.

468
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,400
By last guy you mean
the one who stole your car?

469
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,400
Which means one guy got a car
and the other a career.

470
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,760
No, one minute.

471
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,320
I'm not running a charity here
or a driving school.

472
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Amazing.

473
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,880
You know, I lived in Japan for a year,

474
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
teaching English.

475
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,280
When I got back from Japan,

476
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,040
it was my first weekend in Delhi,

477
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,920
I was watching a movie on my laptop,

478
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,679
and a man was on the roof
of the next building.

479
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,639
He must have been in his forties,
wearing a vest and yellow shorts.

480
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,480
He randomly picks up a pole.

481
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,719
On the other end of the pole...

482
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,400
he had hung a pair of panties.

483
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,719
-Panties?
-Pink panties.

484
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,640
So, he picks up the pole

485
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,800
and starts wildly swinging it in the wind,
this way and that,

486
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,520
with the pink panties.

487
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,760
And suddenly, the sky turns dark.

488
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,280
He was summoning the rain.

489
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,680
No.

490
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,160
The sky darkens because of pigeons.

491
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,920
-Pigeons?
-Pigeons.

492
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,200
They come from everywhere.

493
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,400
They cover the roof.
Pigeons, pigeons everywhere...

494
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,680
Okay. Then?

495
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,480
Nothing. He kept feeding them.

496
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,640
End of story.

497
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,920
I'd like to meet Captain Panties.

498
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,280
For that you have to get out.

499
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,800
Who is Watchman Tiwari here?

500
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,200
It's me, sir.

501
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Did you file a complaint?

502
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,360
Yes.

503
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,640
Two men came here

504
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,960
and just beat me up.

505
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,280
Then?

506
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,480
Sir, they went in and then they left.

507
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,280
-Why did you let them go?
-They were goons, sir.

508
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,080
-Let's go check.
-Sign in, sir.

509
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,280
Well, it looks good.

510
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,920
Try it and then tell me.

511
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,920
God, Karan, it's so good.

512
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,960
Staying home turned you
into MasterChef Delhi?

513
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,000
Thank you.

514
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,760
Other domestic skills,

515
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,280
are they just as good?

516
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,800
I mean, you clean the place.

517
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,240
Plumbing?

518
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,000
No. Tried. Failed.

519
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,520
Oh dear,
you were almost the perfect husband.

520
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,440
Okay, alone is best.

521
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,560
But I have a plumber
who would make the perfect husband.

522
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,120
Hardworking, works day and night...

523
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,280
What's in it for me
if he works day and night?

524
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,440
He might want to fix some drain
even on the wedding night.

525
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,040
"Back in five!" But he never returns.

526
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
But when he returns,
he'll give first-class service.

527
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,600
We'll find a groom later.

528
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,920
What does your family think
about all of this?

529
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,680
They're looking for ways
to get me out of the house.

530
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,760
My mom, dad, friends...

531
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,960
So, for how long, then?

532
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,200
I don't know. As long as I can.

533
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,880
I like this life.

534
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,320
This story just keeps getting better.

535
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,600
You know, my girlfriends keep asking me,
"Where are all the good guys?"

536
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,520
Maybe they're at home...

537
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,320
not stepping out.

538
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,560
But you know, all said and done...

539
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,560
don't you get bored at home?

540
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,720
Bored? No.

541
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,000
You get to learn really strange things
when you're by yourself.

542
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,800
-Alone.
-Really? Like what?

543
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,520
Hikikomori, right?
Zero physical and social contact.

544
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,520
Rejecting society.

545
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,440
Come, I'll show you. Come.

546
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,560
So...

547
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,880
Come.

548
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,080
Do you see that?

549
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,840
Monkeys attack that house every day.

550
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,160
Two brothers live in this apartment.

551
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,560
They fight over the same apartment
and they've hired the same goon.

552
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,840
And...

553
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,600
right there is our nudist uncle.

554
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,480
And over there, the Chinese spy.

555
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,160
How do you know he's a spy?

556
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,480
How do you know the spy is a "he"?

557
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,840
Madam scans the whole neighborhood
with her telescope.

558
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,680
Spy.

559
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,000
But my personal favorite...

560
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,760
our very own, happily-married uncle,

561
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,000
who waits for his wife to leave for work

562
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,120
and his kids, for school,

563
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,000
so that his boyfriend can come over.

564
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,520
The signal...

565
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,560
is given on this balcony -

566
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,360
a yellow towel...

567
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,640
with the message, "It's hot."

568
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
Superb.

569
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,760
But how do you know
that he's his boyfriend?

570
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Because I've seen them
have physical and social contact.

571
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,440
Dating apps? Tinder?
I'm asking for the story.

572
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,840
No, of course. I downloaded Tinder.
Swiped, swiped, deleted.

573
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,720
How come?

574
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,360
When the question,
"Should we meet?" arose,

575
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,800
inviting a girl home seemed weird.

576
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,120
And I don't go out.

577
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,760
Alone is good.

578
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,320
Yeah, that can be really creepy.

579
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm off Tinder too.

580
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,360
My ex-boyfriend downloaded Tinder
on my phone and matched me with every guy.

581
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,720
His idea of a joke.

582
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,760
Actually, I can't handle dating.

583
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,640
If you introduce two strangers like that,
how can you expect any honesty?

584
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,920
Yeah.

585
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,880
I completely agree.

586
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,920
I used to believe that people are honest,

587
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,200
but then I came to my senses.

588
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,280
Alone is best.

589
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,240
Seriously, Karan.

590
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,480
You're not alone. You're lucky.

591
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,800
You have so many friends
and your family cares about you.

592
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,640
They want to see you happy.

593
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:12,080
If I decide to stay at home,
cut myself off from society,

594
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,120
weeks would pass by,
and no one would notice.

595
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,800
I would notice.

596
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,200
Where did you go?

597
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,640
Sorry. What were you saying?

598
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,760
I was saying that I'm a stranger
with whom you must be honest.

599
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,480
Or I couldn't write this story.

600
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,480
Right, right.

601
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,240
Excuse me.

602
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,000
One second.

603
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,520
Pinky.

604
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,680
Karan, baby. Where are you?

605
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,440
Oh, wait. Where could you be?

606
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,040
Pinky! Pinky, this corpse is alive.

607
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,840
He's making sounds
and his eyes are rolling.

608
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,760
What are you saying, baby?

609
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,640
Stupid Rambo.

610
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,320
What will you do now, baby?

611
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,040
What can I do? I'm dying from stress.

612
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,360
Okay, baby, do this.

613
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,480
You have a knife at home, no?
A big kitchen knife?

614
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,320
Yes.

615
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,440
Okay, so, exactly one hand's length
below his left shoulder,

616
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,480
baby, stick the knife in there, okay?

617
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
No. No!

618
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,520
No, no, I understand.

619
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,400
The knife might get stuck in his ribs.

620
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,800
You know what, baby?
Just slit his throat. It's safest.

621
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,640
Spread a plastic sheet
or something on the ground, okay?

622
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,680
Hey, are you crazy?

623
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,600
I'm getting this suitcase out.
I can't deal with this.

624
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,080
Don't be stupid, Karan, baby.

625
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,200
Anyway, you can't.
The police have arrived, so...

626
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,240
Police?

627
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,360
Oh, yes.

628
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:11,280
If the suitcase with the living guy in it
falls into the wrong hands,

629
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,000
baby, it will be a mess.

630
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,440
You know, he'll spill the beans.

631
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,480
So, he's safest in your house.

632
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,800
So, you keep him safe. Okay, baby?
I've got to go now. Bye.

633
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,120
-No, Pinky.
-Rambo, move it away.

634
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,560
No, I'm not safe. I'm...

635
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,400
I'm not safe.

636
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,880
The police can't come here.

637
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:35,080
KHALEESI: YOUR LAPTOP IS IN OFFICE.
WHERE ARE YOU?

638
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,840
IT'S HOT

639
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,200
Hey, what's wrong? All good?

640
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,320
All good.

641
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,800
I've taken up a lot of your time.

642
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,400
I should leave.

643
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,840
I couldn't become your Hikikomori, right?

644
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,560
I should have been weirder.

645
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,800
I should go.

646
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,920
Thank you, Karan.

647
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,880
Good luck with everything.

648
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,960
Yeah.

649
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,000
-Bye.
-Bye.

650
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,280
Bye.

651
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,600
-Handsome.
-What?

652
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,560
Bro,

653
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,760
answer my texts once in a while.

654
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,840
-What is it, JD?
-One minute.

655
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,240
Why are you talking to me
when there is a hot girl with you?

656
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,480
JD, she was here for work, she left.

657
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,440
If you thought it was a date,
you're an asshole.

658
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,080
You've already got rid of her?

659
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,640
No problem.

660
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,920
I'll adjust.

661
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,080
What are you saying?

662
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,560
You know...

663
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,360
You have always been useful to me,

664
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,240
since school, when I used to copy
your math paper and pass.

665
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,680
So?

666
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,920
Women... Women, Karan, when they meet
a sensible, straightforward man,

667
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,800
they start imagining their lives with him.

668
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,040
Steady, reliable and absolutely dull.

669
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,920
Hey, just--

670
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,600
And then they want
a little excitement, so they call JD.

671
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,800
And JD gets what JD wants.

672
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,680
In fact, I'll call her right now.

673
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,640
JD, shut up, or else I'll slap you.

674
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,360
Oh, why?

675
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,040
-You like her, or what?
-Listen, JD, listen to me.

676
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,280
She's a nice person.

677
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,280
So am I.

678
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,560
You just leave her alone.

679
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,400
Okay? Hello...

680
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,040
Are you...

681
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,160
...at Christmas slowly reveals the...

682
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,560
-Karan?
-Hey.

683
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,760
Hey!

684
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:21,960
Is everything okay?

685
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,960
Would you like to come back?

686
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,240
Sorry, what?

687
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,200
Would you like... Hello?

688
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,480
-Hello?
-Hello?

689
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,960
Yeah, I can hear you. What?

690
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,160
Yeah, I...

691
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,040
I thought, if you want to return...
Do come back.

692
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,720
Hello?

693
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,040
Yeah.

694
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,720
Actually, Karan, I have to submit
two articles at the office urgently.

695
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,600
So, I have to rush.

696
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,880
And the interview is over.

697
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,400
Yeah. Well...

698
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,040
I'm glad you came.

699
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,000
Come again some time.

700
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:11,920
Hello?

701
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,960
No, see you... Hello?

702
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,680
-Hello?
-Hello...

703
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,360
Shucks. Perfect!

704
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,240
Hello?

705
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,720
"Come again some time."
Are you crazy, or what?

706
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,680
Can I help you, sir?

707
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,200
Have you seen two goons?

708
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,640
No.

709
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,000
Let's go.

710
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,080
I didn't see anything.

711
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,400
I wasn't here.

712
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,720
I wasn't even here.

713
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,680
Hi.

714
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,400
Hi.

715
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,240
I don't mean to be a pile-on,

716
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,640
but I left my laptop at the office.

717
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,200
And I just found out that there's
no electricity there until the evening.

718
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,480
So, I have to submit
those urgent articles.

719
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,040
The result of going out...

720
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,600
is overrated.

721
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,960
I could have worked on my phone also,
but the battery is low.

722
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,000
And I'm assuming the network was down
because I messaged you.

723
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,960
So, I...

724
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,520
-Should I read them?
-No.

725
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,880
Welcome back.

726
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,680
I'm assuming that you have a laptop.

727
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,600
Yeah. And Wi-Fi, too. Super strong.

728
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,320
You can work from here.
The computer is inside.

729
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,480
You can relax.

730
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,120
Listen, Karan.

731
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,240
I don't normally
conduct interviews like this.

732
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,400
But the interview is over, right?

733
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,720
Come.

734
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah.

735
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,800
Why did you return from Japan?

736
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,040
My visa expired, buddy.

737
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,240
1 NEW MESSAGE

738
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,360
AVOID: WHERE R U?

739
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,040
Even if you turn your phone off,

740
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,560
the world finds a way to intrude.

741
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,480
I'll be right back.

742
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,960
Sir, Tasty Palace.

743
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,000
-Hello, Tasty Palace.
-Your food.

744
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:24,920
It's not mine.

745
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,720
It's not yours?

746
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,000
Does this happen a lot?

747
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,280
-He’ll ask if this is the second floor.
-Is this the second floor, sir?

748
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,680
And now the climax -
"It could be downstairs."

749
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,680
It could be downstairs.

750
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,800
God! You are really calm.

751
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,000
I would have yelled.

752
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,400
Five years ago, I would have yelled.

753
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,120
But it's really nothing. No big deal.

754
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,120
Nice.

755
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,720
So, by staying at home,
you have become calm and kind.

756
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,040
No.

757
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,200
It's just to impress you.

758
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,000
Any other observations?

759
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,120
Oh, many observations.

760
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,040
But before that, I need to work.
And I need to use your bathroom.

761
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,120
Yes, sure. Yes. In here.

762
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,600
You can go... I'll show you.

763
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,200
Thanks.

764
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,160
What's going on here, Karan?

765
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,600
What's going on here?

766
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,440
Who else is here?

767
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,720
I'm sure you have a girlfriend
who has gone out,

768
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,440
and you're all playing a prank on me.

769
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,920
No.

770
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,040
Why... What happened?

771
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,880
That.

772
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,280
That right there
is not a single man's toilet.

773
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,600
I mean, your house is extra clean.
Okay. I get it.

774
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,760
But that bathroom...

775
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,600
Listen, you're not
some psycho murderer, right?

776
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:42,840
No--

777
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,360
This whole time

778
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,120
you thought I was normal.

779
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,760
So, now...

780
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,840
Do you always suspect
that your interview subjects

781
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,640
are about to murder you?

782
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,200
Actually, sometimes.

783
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,160
Next time you come,
I'll keep the bathroom filthy.

784
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,640
Psycho murderer, it seems...

785
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,520
Do you meet many creepy people?

786
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,080
I met a creepy director yesterday.

787
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,920
He just assumed
I was going to sleep with him,

788
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,520
just because he was famous at one point.

789
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,520
The same day. Can you imagine?

790
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,240
Like, I was going to meet him
and fall for him, or something...

791
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,880
-Unbelievable.
-At least, he wasn't a murderer.

792
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,040
Who knows?

793
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,800
Maybe he had a couple of dead bodies
stashed away in a cupboard.

794
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,720
Sorry to disappoint you.

795
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,000
That's all right.

796
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,720
Okay, I should actually do some work now.

797
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,320
Yes, I'll make some coffee.

798
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,960
Genius.

799
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,760
Sorry.

800
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,360
Handsome.

801
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,760
Hi, JD. I'm busy.

802
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,240
Why? Did Saira come back?

803
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,120
Wow.

804
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,640
She did?

805
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,320
She's here to work. I'll call you later.

806
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,080
She came back?

807
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,600
Yes. Let it go. Okay, bye.

808
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,680
-Give Saira the phone.
-Why?

809
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,160
-I want to talk to her.
-What?

810
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,160
She's my friend's friend, right?

811
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,440
What's up, JD?

812
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,240
-Give her the phone.
-Later.

813
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,000
Give her the phone, dude.

814
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,480
Bro.

815
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,720
Hey, give it to her.

816
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,680
Give it to her.

817
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,240
Saira?

818
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,000
-Fine.
-Saira?

819
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,600
He is insisting.

820
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:30,920
JD.

821
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,800
Who? Your friend JD?

822
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,240
Hello?

823
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,600
Why is your phone off?

824
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,800
Hi, JD.

825
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,600
I've been calling you for eons.

826
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,200
How are you, JD?

827
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,920
You know bloody well how I am.

828
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,040
What are you two doing?

829
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,200
Why did you go back?

830
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,320
JD, actually, I'm a bit busy right now.
I have a deadline.

831
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,640
Is he near you?

832
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,440
Is he looking at you?

833
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,680
Okay, JD. Nice chat.

834
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,560
Nice chat? Really?

835
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,880
Like that?

836
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,840
Switch your phone on right now

837
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,880
and tell him we have to speak in private.

838
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,400
No. Not now.

839
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,240
Is he bothering you?

840
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,240
Hang up.

841
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,120
Hang up. I even do the same.

842
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,520
It works.

843
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,120
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah, carry on.

844
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,520
JD, you are a complete bastard.

845
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,960
And she is back.
So, you can speak now? Witch.

846
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,440
You said you wouldn't harass me.

847
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,320
Harass? Is that how you speak to me now?

848
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,840
-First, screw you.
-Okay.

849
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,360
Second, I have a genuine story here.

850
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,440
Oh, man.

851
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,240
And you asked me to meet Karan.

852
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,720
I wondered whether you two
would get along.

853
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,760
Calm down, dude.

854
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,400
Then I remembered what you looked like
when we used to...

855
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,760
No.

856
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,160
I don't want to talk to you.
Why am I talking to you?

857
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,720
Now I'm nervous
that you'll leave me for Karan...

858
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:18,960
Bro. Oh, dude!

859
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,880
Oh, Karan.

860
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,800
Leave you?

861
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,080
I've already left you, JD!

862
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,840
You said you were having
the best sex of your life,

863
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,320
and now you're ruining it?

864
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,800
Brother, do what you want,

865
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,400
but do it quietly - I have a guest.

866
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,400
You were cheating on me, you sleazebag.

867
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,720
Babes, we weren't exclusive.

868
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,680
How many women have you cheated on, JD?

869
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,080
You're a manipulative, lying prick.
That's what you are.

870
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,000
Is Karan a really good guy?

871
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,520
Very much. And I have no idea
how the two of you are friends.

872
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,560
We are friends. Okay?

873
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,080
And Karan is no angel. Trust me.

874
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,600
Trust?

875
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,000
JD, you don't even know
what that word means.

876
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,160
So, don't say, "Trust me."

877
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,880
Every man...

878
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,040
Every man hides something, okay?

879
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,440
I have no idea why we're discussing this
at this point in time.

880
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,600
But I want you to know, that unlike you,

881
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,400
I don't start immediately thinking
about having sex with someone

882
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,640
the moment I meet them.

883
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,240
You and Karan are the same,
made for each other.

884
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,520
If you had been born in the 40s,
you both would make a perfect...

885
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,040
-Bye, JD.
-Okay... Listen.

886
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,280
If you're attracted to Karan,

887
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,720
there's no reason to tell him

888
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,080
the two of us were lovers, okay?

889
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,880
He won't be able to handle it.

890
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:20,880
Why?

891
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,080
Because you two are best friends?

892
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,840
Yes... bum-chums.

893
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,640
But you know a lot about sleeping
with people's best friends, don't you, JD?

894
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,880
It was just one time.

895
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,360
Hey!

896
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,960
Were you and JD arguing?

897
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,160
You know him?

898
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,800
Well, he and my friend once...

899
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,040
Ah...

900
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,800
Typical JD.

901
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,320
You two seem very unlikely friends.

902
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,680
I've known him since school.

903
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,800
Yes, he has big problems.

904
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,720
But deep down, he's a nice guy.

905
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:13,960
If you say so.

906
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,160
Thank you.

907
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,640
What was that noise

908
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,560
that you heard
and then you suddenly ran off.

909
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,640
There's this senior citizen next door.

910
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,800
When he clears his throat,
it's like the apocalypse.

911
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:49,040
These Hikikomoris have got it wrong.

912
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,880
Spending your life
in front of a digital screen...

913
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,440
But that's your life, Karan.

914
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,760
No, I don't stay indoors for the internet.

915
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,840
I just wanted one day...

916
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,160
where no one would disturb me.

917
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,360
It's been nine months.

918
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,160
It's been nine months?

919
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,440
I thought it had been six months.

920
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,480
It will be nine months tomorrow.

921
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,000
Nice. 279 days.

922
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,040
What? 279 days?

923
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,280
Is that why you learned to talk to plants?

924
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,400
I learned to listen.

925
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,560
They listen.

926
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,880
Everyone is so caught up in speaking

927
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,280
that no one listens.

928
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,920
This is why Japanese people...

929
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,840
create Zen gardens.

930
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,480
Sir...

931
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,480
please explain Japan to me.

932
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:24,880
What is it now?

933
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,120
Her phone is off.
Are you sleeping with her?

934
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,840
Are you on drugs again, JD?

935
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,720
Bro... you're a loser.

936
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,200
Sit at home and sulk
if you want to, all your life.

937
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,480
But I want the girl. I'll get her.

938
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,840
Seriously, JD?

939
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,080
Bro, pass the phone.

940
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,000
I'll steal her in front you.

941
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,680
You must be used to this by now.

942
01:04:58,280 --> 01:04:59,200
What happened?

943
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,440
He's lost it. Forget him.

944
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,040
What was he saying?

945
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,880
CALL FROM JD

946
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,600
I'm not taking it.

947
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,440
Don't, no...

948
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,200
JD, what are you doing?

949
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,120
Oh, it's you.

950
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,520
Listen, get out of there.
Enough is enough.

951
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,880
What?

952
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,840
Look, Saira. I'm doing this for you.

953
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,320
Okay? I want you. Get out of there.

954
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,520
You know what?
You, me and your friend Mala...

955
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,560
We should get together.

956
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,880
The two of you look so hot together.

957
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,000
Her name is Maya.

958
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,440
JD, don't ever call me again.

959
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,960
Unbelievable.

960
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,320
What did he say?

961
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,560
I don't remember.

962
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,240
Cool. Me neither.

963
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,240
Man...

964
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,360
You seem completely normal.

965
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,480
Why don't you go out?

966
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,240
Come on.

967
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,440
It's been nine months, Karan.

968
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:37,640
No, thanks.

969
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,880
No, really.

970
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:40,880
Come on.

971
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,680
See, the world's a lovely place.

972
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,280
It's not that lovely.

973
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,680
True.

974
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,360
But step outside.

975
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,160
Today is a good day for staying in.

976
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,400
You're here, good conversation...

977
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,920
Some other day, not today.

978
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,120
So what now?

979
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,120
Is your work finished?

980
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,120
There's a lot left.

981
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,120
Pick up.

982
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,560
Pinky, pick up.

983
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,600
Please, pick up. Please, bloody...

984
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,400
Of course...

985
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,399
Karan, baby.

986
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,439
Pinky.

987
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,000
Where are you?

988
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,240
At the wedding. Where else?

989
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:43,840
When is Rambo coming?

990
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:47,279
Baby, Rambo can't leave me alone here.

991
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,960
There are so many cute boys here.
It will take some more time. Okay?

992
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,279
Oh, hang on, baby.

993
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:53,240
No, no...

994
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,880
-Baby, you're still there?
-I can't take this anymore.

995
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:16,720
I'm dumping the suitcase.

996
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,640
Come on, baby. Rambo will get upset.

997
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:20,840
I have a guest.

998
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,520
Do other people come to your house?

999
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,640
When will he leave?

1000
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,479
I don't know when she'll leave.

1001
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,800
She? It's a girl?

1002
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:34,120
Karan, baby, you rejected me
and now you're with some loose woman?

1003
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,920
-No, no.
-Anyway, not to worry.

1004
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,160
Rambo will pick it up.

1005
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:39,760
I'll scold you later.
My song is ending. Bye.

1006
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,880
No, don't...

1007
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,479
Hello?

1008
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,120
Pinky?

1009
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,800
You listen...

1010
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,440
SLEEPING PILLS

1011
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,120
MY PICTURES

1012
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,760
Hey.

1013
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:49,960
Thank you, chef.

1014
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,200
You're welcome.

1015
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,600
SLEEPING PILLS

1016
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,640
Bro.

1017
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,280
You scream, you die. Okay?

1018
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,200
Hungry?

1019
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,640
Don't scream.

1020
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,800
Please, please.

1021
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:56,760
Drink.

1022
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,440
Relax.

1023
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,280
ARE YOU NORMAL OR NUTS?

1024
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,880
EXPERTS SAY YOU MIGHT NOT
BE AS LOONY AS YOU THINK.

1025
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,480
I was helpless, bro. Sorry.

1026
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,920
If I let you go, they will kill me.
I can't do any more.

1027
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:22,760
That's it?

1028
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,240
You should sleep now.

1029
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,120
Open your mouth.

1030
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:40,960
Open.

1031
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,360
Relax.

1032
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,320
Go to sleep.

1033
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,920
FINISH LAST OF US VIDEO GAME

1034
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,560
I've finished my work.

1035
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,120
Why have you randomly written names
of video games on your planner?

1036
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:31,640
That...

1037
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,720
Put the murder weapon down, please.

1038
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,840
Sorry.

1039
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,760
I have old motion sensor games.
No one plays them.

1040
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,520
Wow, I grew up playing
motion sensor games. I love them!

1041
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,680
Of course you do.

1042
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,400
Come on, then!

1043
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,640
I will beat you on your home ground.

1044
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,280
I thought your Hikikomori lair
would be exciting.

1045
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,080
You know, messy, full of secrets...

1046
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,480
What sort of hidden fortress is this?

1047
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,240
Well...

1048
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,920
Next time, I'll make this messy too.

1049
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,840
By the way, that suitcase is so you.

1050
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,760
Oh, that belongs to my neighbor.

1051
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,760
He left it here for the day.

1052
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,120
-Come. Shall we?
-Yeah, let's do this.

1053
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,360
Nice.

1054
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,400
It's been a long time since
I last spent so much time with anyone.

1055
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,760
Wow.

1056
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,080
So what now?

1057
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,160
Do you feel like kicking me out?

1058
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,760
No, on the contrary...

1059
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,960
I'm actually enjoying it.

1060
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,240
Sure?

1061
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,080
Yes.

1062
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,880
You're losing. Try harder.

1063
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,920
And I thought I was the competitive one.

1064
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,600
But I...

1065
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
just won.

1066
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:40,960
Are we done?

1067
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,120
I saw a tennis game.

1068
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,200
Tennis?

1069
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,640
Yeah.

1070
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,480
VIRTUAL TENNIS 4

1071
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,960
This is amazing.

1072
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,320
I miss this.

1073
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,480
I think you miss losing.

1074
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,760
-Play.
-Shut up.

1075
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,040
Show off.

1076
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,520
Focus...

1077
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,920
or you'll lose.

1078
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:42,920
This is the best.

1079
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,120
Play when you want.

1080
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,560
Alone or with someone.

1081
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,920
You control the players and...

1082
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,200
nobody

1083
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,040
can

1084
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:00,960
lie.

1085
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,000
Yes!

1086
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,960
Good game.

1087
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,480
What's next?

1088
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,040
Okay, my turn.

1089
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,360
Favorite movie?

1090
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,520
Sholay.

1091
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,320
Sholay is, like, mid-70s.

1092
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,640
Favorite romantic comedy?

1093
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,240
-Sholay.
-What?

1094
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,720
It is. Sholay is every kind of film.

1095
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,280
The last olive...

1096
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,080
This is Basanti.

1097
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,000
Basanti, go to Veeru. You are Veeru.

1098
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,200
Basanti won't last long with me.

1099
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,520
She'll be exhausted
listening to me complain

1100
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,440
about how much I hate my office.

1101
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,840
My life doesn't even have an office.

1102
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,600
Take it.

1103
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,400
Forget the office.
I'm trapped in this city.

1104
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,640
I'm physically trapped in this apartment.

1105
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,440
Are we playing
"the biggest loser gets the olive"?

1106
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,880
Because I got run over by a cow once.

1107
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,920
Cow? Don't even try it.

1108
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:22,240
My life is a lot more
messed up than yours,

1109
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,880
and I don't even know how to fix it.

1110
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,000
So, this olive...

1111
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,720
is mine.

1112
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,000
Wait.

1113
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,160
My ex-boyfriend cheated on me
with my best friend,

1114
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,560
and I don't think
I'll ever trust anyone again.

1115
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,200
I'm sorry.

1116
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,960
My wife eloped with my boss.

1117
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,320
We got married and I worked like mad...

1118
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,880
because I really wanted...

1119
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,080
a perfect life for us.

1120
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,320
So, I worked hard, day and night.

1121
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,800
I even did my boss' work.

1122
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,800
I later found out that my boss had been
at my house all along, doing my job.

1123
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,200
I lost my wife and my job.

1124
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,880
I was too ashamed to step out.

1125
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,800
Then it was nicer indoors.

1126
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:35,400
Now, I'm used to it.

1127
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,720
For years, she kept telling me,

1128
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,760
"Karan, come home.

1129
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,800
Karan, come home."

1130
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,160
And Karan came home.

1131
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,800
But now he can't leave home.

1132
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,200
Hello, sir, Tasty Palace.

1133
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,360
Hi, Tasty Palace.

1134
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,800
Here is your food.

1135
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,880
It's not mine.

1136
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,000
Is this not your food?

1137
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,000
Is this the third floor?

1138
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,520
This is the best floor.

1139
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,600
What is this?

1140
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,520
I should leave.

1141
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,960
I don't think I can do this, Karan.

1142
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:32,960
I don't know what got into me.

1143
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,240
No, I...

1144
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:36,160
I liked it.

1145
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,560
I've made big mistakes, Karan.

1146
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,200
Me too.

1147
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,720
But I don't think today was a mistake.

1148
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:56,680
I like you.

1149
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,520
Then when you leave,

1150
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,520
you must call me, please.

1151
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:07,800
Yes.

1152
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:40,440
Look...

1153
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,760
I really like you, too.

1154
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,920
But...

1155
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,760
I wasn't mentally prepared
for any of this.

1156
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,880
Something happens now and then later...

1157
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:56,160
-You know what I mean.
-I know.

1158
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:57,360
You're right.

1159
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,960
It would be stupid.

1160
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,000
Yeah, we shouldn't be stupid.

1161
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:03,440
Yeah.

1162
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:06,760
Okay.

1163
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:08,960
Take care.

1164
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,120
Bye.

1165
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,960
Hello?

1166
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,000
JD?

1167
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,600
Now, you listen.

1168
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,680
We've known each other
for 20 years, right?

1169
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,320
You've never been as much of an asshole
as you have been today.

1170
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,280
So, I thought,

1171
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,560
if you were serious about all of this...

1172
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,200
you would come home and talk to me.

1173
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,640
That was your plan, right?

1174
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:39,120
-What?
-To deliberately goad me about Saira, no?

1175
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,960
Is this your attempt at matchmaking?

1176
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,040
Bro, what are you talking about?

1177
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,120
Look, I'm busy. I'm at a party.

1178
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,560
No, you're not busy. You're just wrong.

1179
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,760
Balls to your good or bad intentions.
I don't care.

1180
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,680
Straight talk from Karan? Wow.

1181
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,000
Did you just have sex?

1182
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,280
No, I didn't. And it doesn't matter.

1183
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,160
What matters
is that you stop manipulating people.

1184
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,840
You're serious?

1185
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,040
Yes.

1186
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,720
Also, you introduced me to Saira...

1187
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,160
Thank you.

1188
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,000
Creepy bastard.

1189
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,920
I'm losing you, bro.

1190
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,360
Let's get stupid?

1191
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,440
Yes, please.

1192
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,080
Do you realize
that since you've been inside,

1193
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,720
bra technology has changed?

1194
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,080
What? Impossible.

1195
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,840
Do designers need your permission?

1196
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,040
I would have found out on the internet.

1197
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,280
Very good.

1198
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,440
My hair.

1199
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,480
Sorry. It's been a while.

1200
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,560
You remember the basics, right?

1201
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,760
Yeah, the basics, yes.

1202
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,160
If you want to Google it, you can check.

1203
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,480
I'll wait.

1204
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,520
Okay...

1205
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,080
you remember everything.

1206
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,960
You're very kind.

1207
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,560
I'm easy to please.

1208
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:34,240
I think you're very beautiful.

1209
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,600
Was it good for you?

1210
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,160
I'll have to think about it.

1211
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:50,080
Let's try a few more times

1212
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,040
and decide in the morning.

1213
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,440
Really?

1214
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:54,360
Yes.

1215
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,440
Are you awake?

1216
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,040
Are you okay?

1217
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,040
I'm not sure.

1218
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,320
I don't usually wake up like this.

1219
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,040
Me neither.

1220
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,680
How did this happen?

1221
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,640
I think it somehow started with Sholay.

1222
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,400
I'll have to be careful...

1223
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,120
or people will talk about Sholay
and take advantage of me.

1224
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,880
How many men were there?

1225
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,880
Chief, two.

1226
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,240
-There were two, Chief. Two.
-Idiot.

1227
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,320
Crazy. Haven't you ever seen any before?

1228
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,280
Can I ask you something?

1229
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,000
Yes, ask me.

1230
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:50,680
I can trust you, right?

1231
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:08,600
Shit!

1232
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,120
Should I have said no?

1233
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,080
I have to go to work.

1234
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,440
-No, don't go.
-Yes.

1235
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,800
Okay, shut your eyes.

1236
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:20,280
I haven't shaved my legs

1237
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:21,960
and my underwear is boring, too.

1238
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,040
Listen to me.

1239
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,120
Stay here.

1240
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,880
Then I won't have to see your work undies.

1241
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,000
It works out for both of us.

1242
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,760
That's very tempting, but I have to go.

1243
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:34,720
Stay.

1244
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I can't.

1245
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,480
-Stay.
-I can't.

1246
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,520
Stay.

1247
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,360
I'm leaving, but...

1248
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,040
I'll be back.

1249
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,040
-What?
-What?

1250
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,800
I...

1251
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:20,680
I was thinking...

1252
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,440
Will you come back?

1253
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,040
Or shouldn't I have asked that?

1254
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:31,960
I am coming back.

1255
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,320
Sorry.

1256
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,960
I'll get over it.

1257
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:43,720
What the hell?

1258
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,200
What's going on?

1259
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,600
I can explain.

1260
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:41,080
He was here, all this while?

1261
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,640
-While we...
-Yes. Actually, he was sleeping.

1262
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,200
All day? He was here?

1263
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,960
Who are you, Karan?

1264
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:52,040
No... He is from downstairs, not here.

1265
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,920
I don't know.

1266
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,240
Someone was supposed to pick him up.

1267
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,120
This is sick.

1268
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,400
The girl downstairs...

1269
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,160
Her father... gangster.

1270
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:02,800
Rambo would kill me.

1271
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:03,680
-I mean...
-What?

1272
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,840
She left him here.
I didn't know what to do.

1273
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,520
I don't know how to explain.

1274
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:09,960
Don't even bother.

1275
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:11,960
Freak. Idiot.

1276
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,400
Is this a game that you and JD play?

1277
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,400
JD?

1278
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,560
You pass girls on to each other,

1279
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,040
make up weird stories to trick them...

1280
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:22,920
Is that what you do?

1281
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,720
You...

1282
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,320
and JD?

1283
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,480
Both of you...

1284
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,840
Both of you are players.

1285
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,200
He cheats and then you take a turn.

1286
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,160
And I trusted you.

1287
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,200
I...

1288
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:44,160
didn't know anything about you and JD.

1289
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,960
And if trust is so important
then why didn't you tell me.

1290
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:51,800
JD and I were a thing. Not anymore.

1291
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:55,920
He told me about you and said
you were the world's biggest idiot.

1292
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,400
But it turns out,
there's no bigger idiot than me.

1293
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,400
Really, Saira...

1294
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,360
there was no plan.

1295
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:05,720
What does it matter?

1296
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,920
Look at your face.

1297
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,600
Such innocence.

1298
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:12,560
I'm done.

1299
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,280
Sa--

1300
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,600
Just stop it, man.

1301
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,560
Baby, who is this?

1302
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:41,360
-She was outside, crying.
-She's my friend. Let her go.

1303
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,680
Oh, friend?

1304
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,400
Let her go. Put her down.

1305
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,520
-Rambo.
-Please.

1306
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,160
Rambo, go.

1307
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:53,600
Stop!

1308
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:56,280
First, tell her that I'm not in your gang.

1309
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,920
You got him in here by force

1310
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,960
and you told me you'd kill me
if I let him go.

1311
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:03,320
Tell her.

1312
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,200
We totally forced him.

1313
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,280
No one comes here anyway.

1314
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,640
-Karan.
-No.

1315
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,560
I didn't want any of this.

1316
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:26,120
Did I invite any of you here? No.

1317
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,240
I didn't want anyone to come here.
You all showed up.

1318
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:34,280
Now, I want all of you...

1319
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,080
to go.

1320
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,160
Please leave.

1321
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,680
-Karan, I'll stay and help you--
-No, please.

1322
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:47,920
I'm fine. So...

1323
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,120
Oh, sweetie...

1324
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:55,320
don't tell the police, okay?

1325
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,080
Full drama only.

1326
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:08,680
Pinky,

1327
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,040
you too.

1328
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:12,920
Leave. Now.

1329
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,160
Like that?

1330
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,840
Yes.

1331
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:23,360
A little sex
and the mouse turns into a tiger.

1332
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:26,880
Rambo!

1333
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,160
Baby,

1334
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,200
no one talks to Pinky like that.

1335
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,000
It's just not allowed.

1336
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,880
Rules are rules. Rambo, go!

1337
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:54,640
Rambo,

1338
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,360
go means kill him.

1339
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,400
What happened?

1340
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:03,720
Love.

1341
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:11,400
Smart Rambo.

1342
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,240
Thank you.

1343
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,720
One minute.

1344
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,200
Rambo.

1345
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:31,560
Where is everyone?

1346
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,880
Make up your mind, Karan, baby.

1347
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,920
First, you tell everyone to leave

1348
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,680
and then you ask where they went.

1349
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:42,240
You won't kill him, right?

1350
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,920
Whatever I do,
it won't be in your precious house.

1351
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,240
Anyway, I won't kill him.

1352
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,560
He gave me all the information

1353
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:51,840
and he works for me now.

1354
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:53,960
Rambo took him downstairs.

1355
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,680
And, baby, we have to be ruthless
in our business,

1356
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,360
or we appear weak.

1357
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,480
So, I can't say sorry.

1358
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,320
It's okay.

1359
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,040
We're still... friends.

1360
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,640
Okay, I have to ask you...

1361
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:11,120
Do you like that girl a lot?

1362
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,400
I do.

1363
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,000
Are you going to go after her?

1364
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,400
She's gone.

1365
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:28,880
Baby, does she have a car?

1366
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:17,480
Love.

1367
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:45,840
I'm sorry.

1368
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:49,800
Me too.

1369
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:52,480
Come back?

1370
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,400
My place?

1371
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,360
THE END

1372
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,440
TRANSLATED BY: NEENA KISS

1373
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,000
Hello, sir. Shall I cook food for you?

1374
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,680
Pinky, dear...

1375
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:34,840
Shit!

1376
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,480
No...

1377
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:44,720
This is wrong.

1378
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,080
I was joking.
