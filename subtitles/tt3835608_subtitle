1
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:06,106
Smoking and drinking
is injurious to health.

2
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:08,310
Smoking and drinking
is injurious to health.

3
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:52,321
Hail! Hail! Hail the supreme lord!

4
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,427
Hail! Hail! Hail the supreme lord!

5
00:01:08,779 --> 00:01:10,872
Are you crying when cutting onions?

6
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:13,206
Are your tomatoes becoming pulp?

7
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:15,413
Is it hot when cutting chillies?

8
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:17,847
Then you have to purchase this slicer.

9
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:20,480
It costs only Rs.1499 only.

10
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:24,056
But if you order in next five minutes,
you can have it for Rs.625 only.

11
00:01:24,528 --> 00:01:26,689
With this latest sharp edge technology..

12
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:28,799
..you can cut vegetables
in the size of your choice.

13
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:30,526
Badaliya slice wizard!

14
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:34,129
Wow! Are these just for vegetables?
- What else?

15
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:36,464
Wow! Bedaliya slice wizard!

16
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:38,303
Your kitchen will turn
into a heaven with this.

17
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:40,171
Badaliya slice wizard!

18
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:41,536
Cut it!

19
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:46,741
Everything is fine, Mr. Venkat.

20
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:48,346
Are my dialogues okay? - Perfect.

21
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:49,646
Your schedule for today is over.

22
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:54,422
Hey, Venky! It seems you
are enjoying your job a lot.

23
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,823
Do you mean tele-shopping anchoring?

24
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:59,660
No! Don't know how
long but it is irritating.

25
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:01,388
How long were you working?

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,865
By next march, it will be four years.

27
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:09,331
That means you must have
been famous TV actor by now.

28
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:11,632
Nothing like that.
No one even recognizes me.

29
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:13,469
Are you serious?

30
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:15,238
Why doesn't anyone recognize
when you are there for 4 years?

31
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:17,710
Don't you believe me? Come with me.

32
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:21,447
Here, can any of you recognize me?

33
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:28,756
Don't feel bad, Venky.

34
00:02:28,993 --> 00:02:31,757
But I heard that the ladies
at office are your close friends.

35
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,297
Oh, feeling shy?!

36
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,766
Venky! Do you have
any work this evening?

37
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:38,926
I cannot.

38
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:42,668
What's the work? - A small shopping.

39
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:45,341
This time sari!
You selection is always best.

40
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:48,036
Oh, how can you ask
me to select a sari for you?

41
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:49,806
I gave my appointment
to someone else. Sorry!

42
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:53,048
Are you bored even after such fans?

43
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:54,879
There is no relation
between job and this.

44
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,146
I don't want to do this job.

45
00:02:57,688 --> 00:02:59,849
What did I think of
doing and what am I doing?

46
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,153
What did you think of doing?
- My father's name is N. Bhanumurthy.

47
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:04,124
Did you hear his name?

48
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,786
Bhanumurthy means the person
in dooradarshan(TV channel)..

49
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:09,764
Yes, he is. I too wanted to
become famous news reader like him.

50
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:10,832
That's good.

51
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:13,768
I didn't see him lately.

52
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:15,872
After cable TV was introduced in 1991..

53
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:17,232
..he suffered paralysis.

54
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:18,739
After that he lost his ability to speak.

55
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:21,037
Oh, no! How is his treatment going?

56
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:22,975
There will be one hour
session every Sunday.

57
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,849
Another typhoon in Bay of Bengal.

58
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:30,381
Coastal people are in fear.

59
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:32,647
Mr. Venkayyanaidu assured
that they will win in four states..

60
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:36,188
..and madam Sonia denied that.

61
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:40,356
Onions Rs.100,
petrol Rs.80 and Rs.70:$1.

62
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:42,192
These rates are making people cry.

63
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,592
Did you see? He moved.

64
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:48,395
Government and oil companies conflict
regarding gas companies dispute.

65
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:51,166
Kholi helped India win with a ton.

66
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,637
The news ends now.

67
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,971
We shall meet here at
the same time next sunday.

68
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,570
Yours, N. Venkateswara Rao.

69
00:03:57,982 --> 00:03:59,677
Such an improvement
in just ten sessions.

70
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:01,910
He will become normal
with 40 more sessions.

71
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:08,749
When your father read the news,
everyone used to feel great.

72
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,651
You should also become famous like him.

73
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,721
Oh, no! By the way I heard the channel..

74
00:04:14,865 --> 00:04:16,492
..you are working is going
to start news bulletin.

75
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,930
Why don't you try in that?
- I already did, sir.

76
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:20,668
There is a twist in that too.

77
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:23,233
There are two demons standing
between me and news reading.

78
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:24,635
Who are they?

79
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:26,875
First is Vamanrao.

80
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,438
Give it. - Just try.

81
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:29,443
Oh!

82
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:37,043
Listen, it is not enough
if you want to become news reader.

83
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:38,280
You need to work hard.

84
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:40,253
If you waste your time all day..

85
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:42,518
..who will supply news
for you in the evening?

86
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,254
Listen, Mr. Vamanrao!
If you read news with that voice..

87
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,154
..you will need a guy
like me to do the dubbing part.

88
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,765
You just watch.
I will be reading news tonight.

89
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:54,835
Hey boy! It is not the voice
that is need to read the news..

90
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:56,829
..you should have honesty in your heart.

91
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:59,702
Courage to say any news without fear.

92
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:01,441
More than anything else..

93
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:03,672
..you need to know current affairs
and not these affairs.

94
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:05,578
Who is the second person? - My boss!

95
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:06,974
A. Udayabhaskar.

96
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:13,584
What is it, Uday?
Why are you standing alone in the photo?

97
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,716
I am like this since childhood.
I am different.

98
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:17,590
Yes, Venki told me that.

99
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,322
Did Venky tell you? About what?

100
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:24,162
He said that you hate humans
and go to zoo every sunday.

101
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:26,902
That you don't know
how to speak to people.

102
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:29,164
Especially with ladies. - He is nuts.

103
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:31,466
He might have said it because
I didn't made him news reader.

104
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:33,772
What else did he say?

105
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:36,539
Since you are motherless
and grew up studying in hostels..

106
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,910
..and since you possessed
everything that you need..

107
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:40,381
..you became like this.

108
00:05:40,517 --> 00:05:41,575
Just a moment.

109
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,560
I hate people who behaves
like him in the office.

110
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:54,523
You are jealous that
he speaks well with ladies.

111
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:55,790
It is not a big deal.

112
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:58,493
Everything is written in this book.

113
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:01,764
People bit dust by following such books.

114
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:03,737
I don't think so. Do you want to see?

115
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:05,366
Friends!

116
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:08,009
That was a fine presentation.
Let us meet after the lunch.

117
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:09,044
Okay.

118
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:10,613
Katti! - Yeah?

119
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:12,341
Can I speak with you for a moment?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:14,783
When are we going on a date?
- Excuse me?

121
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:16,380
Just to have some fun.

122
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:18,985
I am the executive vice-president
of this company.

123
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:20,750
Is this how you behave with me?

124
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:25,317
How long are you going to hide?
I understood your true intentions.

125
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,890
How did you understand?

126
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:29,156
It is written in this.

127
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,263
If a girl wears short
clothes like that..

128
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:33,332
..it means she like
that other person a lot.

129
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:36,538
Showing her open hand means,
'I am open..'

130
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:39,267
'..and I have nothing to hide.'

131
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:40,735
What if I stand like this?

132
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:43,369
If you stand like that then you are..

133
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:45,607
..my slave. - Oh!

134
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,214
What if I stand like this?

135
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:50,052
It says that you are ready
to live together with me.

136
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:51,977
What is the meaning
if I slap you like this?

137
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:55,589
It is not in the book,
but I understood.

138
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:57,451
I got it pretty clearly, actually.

139
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:02,056
Oh, she didn't consider
that you are a motherless child.

140
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,224
Don't worry.

141
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,627
Ladies behave differently sometimes.
I don't mind.

142
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:06,961
But your prestige is ruined.

143
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:08,262
I don't tell this to anyone.

144
00:07:08,572 --> 00:07:10,506
What if she says?
- I can counter in a thousand ways.

145
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:12,370
Who will trust her?
Anyone didn't see this.

146
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,468
If you are so dumb, how are you going
to get married? Do you have any plans?

147
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:17,671
About the marriage?

148
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:19,146
My dad is searching matches.

149
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,175
What else did Venki say?

150
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:25,047
Venky! I spoke to your boss.

151
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:27,353
Is that true?
What did you say to him?

152
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,221
If you insist..

153
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:32,253
..he might give you news reader post.

154
00:07:32,896 --> 00:07:35,126
What do you mean by insist?
- Confidently.

155
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:37,491
All the best. Bye!

156
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,296
Come in!

157
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:46,876
Hey, celeb boy!
I have edited your ad yesterday.

158
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:49,077
It was wonderful.
You are made for this, man.

159
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,780
How long should I do this, Mr. Uday?

160
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:54,541
You promised me many things.

161
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:56,278
You said you will give
me news and gameshow.

162
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:58,120
You said many things.

163
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,889
But I heard that you
are giving it to Vamanrao.

164
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:02,958
Yes. - Sir!

165
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:06,993
Please give me evening
news reader post, sir.

166
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:08,722
Listen, Venki!

167
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,227
A host of the game show..

168
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:13,163
..don't know who plays and who wins.

169
00:08:13,403 --> 00:08:14,495
What do we get from that?

170
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:16,833
If it is news reader, it's about scams..

171
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:19,134
..foreign trips and assembly sessions..

172
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,400
..releasing of movies..

173
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:21,669
..just telling everything.
They don't show your talent.

174
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:23,908
Just look at you. Badaliya slice wizard.

175
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:27,076
It was wonderful. Sales increased
because of your anchoring.

176
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:30,743
Venki! That is your talent.
Don't waste it.

177
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:32,712
Okay? Don't waste my time too.

178
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,289
Sir! - Yes?

179
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:36,450
You are stone hearted.

180
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:39,587
Venki! Please!

181
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,033
What is it, Venki?

182
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:53,538
Why are you crying after
using Badaliya slice wizard?

183
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,440
What is the reason? What is it?

184
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:06,547
Hello?

185
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:09,758
Yes? Greetings, sir! How are you?

186
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:11,717
Match from Karampudi!

187
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:16,294
My son is busy launching Tamil channel.

188
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,161
He said he doesn't want
to get married this year.

189
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:29,042
Hello? Actually my son is very tall.

190
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,438
It will be better if
the girl is at least 5'9''.

191
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:36,883
Hello?

192
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,988
Her birth star is 'Aslesha'.

193
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:40,649
Hello, are you listening?

194
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:45,455
It is said that her mom-in-law
dies if this marriage happens.

195
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:47,527
But groom's mother is already dead, sir?

196
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:49,462
That is why we want to be extra careful.

197
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,264
Hello?

198
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,303
My son studied MBA.

199
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:00,909
It would have been nice if
the girl finished her graduation.

200
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:08,183
Hello? The girl is..

201
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:10,943
..more educated than the guy.
It doesn't sound good.

202
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:18,494
Sir! My son is running a TV channel.

203
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:20,729
He has to attend to
parties with big shots.

204
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:24,033
His wife shouldn't
be too much traditional.

205
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:26,666
He said it would be nice
if she can move in society.

206
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:33,468
My son is outgoing,
if she is also outgoing..

207
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,771
..who will take care
of our traditional values?

208
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:42,151
We showed it to our family priest..

209
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:43,877
..he said their
horoscopes did not match.

210
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:45,681
Even we approached the same priest.

211
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:47,380
He said they were nicely matched.

212
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:50,284
We say many things
if we don't like the match.

213
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:52,794
You shouldn't question us directly.

214
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:04,667
I cannot do this.

215
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,905
Earlier you used to
get three matches per week.

216
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:09,908
Now..

217
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:12,704
It became very rare
like Olympic medals.

218
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:13,975
That is the situation.

219
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:16,051
When do you want to get married?

220
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:17,215
When I get that mood.

221
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,049
How many matches should I send back?

222
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:20,347
Didn't you like any of them?

223
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:22,185
There is just one match that I like.
And that isn't it.

224
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,254
That is why I have decided..

225
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:26,084
..no matter if the
girl is from middle class..

226
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,125
..I just want her to be beautiful.
That is why I called him.

227
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:32,098
Sir! You are playing too
much with marriage proposals.

228
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:35,329
If you still adamant..
- I am not adamant. I am intelligent.

229
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:36,799
I see!

230
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,873
Too much intelligence is also harmful.

231
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,368
Have a look.

232
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:44,770
Wow! Look at this girl.
She is wonderful.

233
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:45,980
Take a look.

234
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:47,241
Oh, no!

235
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:52,716
How can you reject without
even looking at the photo?

236
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:54,048
Is it okay if I reject
after looking at it?

237
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:00,629
She is a doctor.

238
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:02,291
But it is written that she is a dentist.

239
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:04,127
Yes, she is a dentist.

240
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:06,662
She is very involved in her occupation.

241
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:08,962
But her family members
wanted her to get married.

242
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,364
Did you like her?

243
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:12,834
Fix the marriage date.
I will get married soon.

244
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,342
We should go and see her first.

245
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,406
Excuse me!

246
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:23,809
Why did you call me urgently?

247
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:32,852
I didn't call you
for office work, Venki.

248
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:35,024
Then?

249
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:37,298
I saw you talking to girls many times.

250
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,697
Sir! I will stop that, sir.

251
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,260
Are you not afraid?

252
00:12:40,403 --> 00:12:42,098
Don't you feel tensed thinking
'they like me or not?'.

253
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,031
Why should I feel tensed
if they don't like you, sir?

254
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:45,039
That's not it.

255
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:46,708
How can they speak so closely with you?

256
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:48,872
I don't know how to approach them.

257
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:50,840
I don't know how to express my feelings.

258
00:12:51,081 --> 00:12:52,412
I don't know anything regarding women.

259
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:53,909
What happened?

260
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:55,882
I had marriage looks yesterday.

261
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:57,144
Did she say that she didn't like you?

262
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:58,515
There wouldn't have been
choice if she said that.

263
00:12:58,655 --> 00:12:59,849
Oh! She said she wants to talk to me.

264
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,958
She said what we saw
and spoke there is not enough.

265
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:03,682
She said we have to talk over dinner.

266
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:07,294
I want her to choose me, Venki.
- That is fine.

267
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:09,426
I didn't see you like this before.

268
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,100
I don't know but I like that girl.

269
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:14,803
This is really unexpected..

270
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:16,805
..but I really want to marry her.

271
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:18,836
But I don't know
how to make her like me.

272
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:20,667
What will you do if you are in my place?

273
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:22,708
You are praising me a lot.

274
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:24,574
What will you do if you are in my place?

275
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:26,911
I will give a nice advice
to the boss and get good impression.

276
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:31,651
Okay. Did you go to
their house yesterday?

277
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:32,517
Yes.

278
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:34,179
You did. So What did you saw there?

279
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,760
A sweet plate on the table,
light snack in the hand..

280
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:39,292
..two incense sticks..

281
00:13:39,663 --> 00:13:40,789
I didn't mean that, sir.

282
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:43,465
Did you see some
cupboards or racks there?

283
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:44,625
Yes. I did.

284
00:13:45,535 --> 00:13:48,003
There was a cupboard
and an old fridge next to it.

285
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:51,039
What did you see on the fridge
and also on the table in front of you?

286
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:53,540
Did you observe anything?
- What work do we have with them, Venki?

287
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:56,476
By looking at the furniture in
her house, you can find her interests..

288
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,309
..and can try to understand her.

289
00:13:58,515 --> 00:14:01,313
Oh! That is what you mean?

290
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:03,610
"Black clouds are forming.."

291
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:05,210
There were many
photographs of her taken..

292
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:06,515
..at different cities sticked
on the fridge.

293
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:10,251
Mr. Uday!
What can we understand from this?

294
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:11,989
That girl..

295
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:14,323
Is a wanderer.

296
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:15,926
She likes travelling, sir.

297
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,597
So, you can say that
you love travelling.

298
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:20,795
What else did you see?

299
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:24,201
And.. I saw Md.
Raffi song collection in the cupboard.

300
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,573
She likes Md. Raffi, isn't that true?

301
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:29,736
No, she likes his songs.

302
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:33,012
If you study about
Md. Raffi's greatness..

303
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:34,514
..and play his songs in your car..

304
00:14:34,818 --> 00:14:37,252
..and display your greatness.

305
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:39,250
Okay! Okay! Okay! - Next?

306
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:40,918
Next?

307
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:44,188
I saw a book on Raja Raghuvaran's
paintings near the window.

308
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:47,893
Super! With painting scheme in center..

309
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:49,089
..I know a restaurant.

310
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,997
Ravi Varma's paintings
are displayed in a corner there.

311
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:53,967
Take her there and
speak about Ravi Varma.

312
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,495
I saw many books in the cupboard.

313
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,732
I will say that I like reading.

314
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:00,507
Not only that,
you can gift her a nice book.

315
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,836
Yeah, definitely.

316
00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:03,774
When speaking with her..

317
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:05,313
..I can use big english
words in the middle.

318
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:07,311
That's it.
Did you see how simple this is?

319
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,575
Thanks, Venki! It is nice
when you encourage me like this.

320
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:11,548
You can take your scooter tomorrow.

321
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:12,747
I will drop you in my car. Come on.

322
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:16,024
By the way Venki,
you move so closely with girls.

323
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:17,286
Didn't you like any girl?

324
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:19,122
Yes, I did. But..

325
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:21,424
Oh, didn't she like you?

326
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:23,396
She did. We liked each other.

327
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,330
What is the problem then?

328
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,660
That is a beautiful story.
- You tell me the story.

329
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:27,962
I will decide whether
it is beautiful or not.

330
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:29,902
Not now, sir.
- It's alright, Venki. Come on.

331
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,974
Is that necessary? - Of course!

332
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:33,867
Few years back, for summer holidays..

333
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:35,671
..I went to Vizag.

334
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,171
There I met a girl.

335
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:49,149
Rs.40 for Rs.80!

336
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,927
Rs.40 for Rs.80! Rs.40 for Rs.80!

337
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:54,992
Pavan Kalyan's latest movie.
Rs.40 for Rs.80! Madam!

338
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,157
What?

339
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:00,927
Rs.40 for Rs.80!

340
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:02,727
You are selling Rs.40
ticket for Rs.80? - Yes.

341
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:06,200
I feel like giving it for
Rs.70 for you.

342
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,411
But I don't want give
you more than Rs.50.

343
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:09,975
This has become common everywhere.

344
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:12,608
I will not take anything
less than Rs.70.

345
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,545
Okay, I have two tickets.

346
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:17,343
If you take both of them,
I will give for Rs.100. Okay?

347
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:18,846
Okay, get lost.

348
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:21,851
Hello!

349
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:23,150
I have a boyfriend.

350
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,554
I too have a girlfriend.

351
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:26,887
Name?

352
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:29,588
N. Venkateswara Rao. - No.

353
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,259
Listen, please!

354
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:34,931
Shall we take those
two tickets for Rs.100?

355
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:36,762
I will give you fifty rupees.

356
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,667
Or I can give you sixty. - What?!

357
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:43,279
Do you think that
I sell tickets in black?

358
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:45,274
No. - That is not the problem.

359
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,246
How can I sit next
to you to watch the movie?

360
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:51,180
Granny!

361
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:53,986
Please tell her, granny!

362
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:56,488
Yes, child! He is a good guy.

363
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,251
He sat with me last week.

364
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:00,226
He bought me popcorn in the interval.

365
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:03,892
Okay, let us go.

366
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:07,395
I don't want money, but I want
popcorn and coke in the interval.

367
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:24,618
So?

368
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:27,650
You said that you stay at Sitanagar.

369
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,520
Even I stay there.

370
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:31,790
If you don't mind..

371
00:17:32,662 --> 00:17:34,061
..I can drop you on my bike.

372
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:36,732
It's alright. I will go.

373
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:42,632
Okay, come on.

374
00:17:43,073 --> 00:17:44,301
Yes. - Okay.

375
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:45,767
Come!

376
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:53,171
Actually! I have to tell you something.

377
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,642
What?

378
00:17:54,851 --> 00:17:56,375
I don't have any bike.

379
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,681
I came here by bus. - What?

380
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,821
Why did you say that
you would drop me then?

381
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:05,459
I thought it would be romantic.

382
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:09,328
I have a scooty. Come on, let us go.

383
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:14,064
One minute!

384
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:18,634
When you came by scooty,
why did you agree to come with me?

385
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:32,413
You stay at LIC apartments and so do I.

386
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:34,547
Still I don't know your name.
- Prabhavati.

387
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:36,522
Nice name. - I don't think so.

388
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,455
My full name is Sri
Sai Sirisha Prabhavati.

389
00:18:40,897 --> 00:18:41,989
Nice names!

390
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:44,827
It should be either
Sirisha or Prabhavati.

391
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:46,799
I don't like both of them together.

392
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:49,669
How will it sound if a
boy is named Ramudu Bheemudu?

393
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,371
Rama Krishna is a common name for boys.

394
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:54,409
What is there in the name.
Just leave it.

395
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:57,405
I have to tell you something.
I don't have any boyfriend.

396
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:59,144
I don't have any friends in this city.

397
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:01,108
I am from Delhi.

398
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,648
I came to Vizag for the first time.

399
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:04,514
To my grandmother's house.

400
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:05,921
I am from Hyderabad.

401
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:07,482
I came to my aunt's house.

402
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,184
To spend the holidays.

403
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:12,718
I think you too don't
have any girlfriend.

404
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,961
Should I lie or tell you the truth?

405
00:19:16,966 --> 00:19:18,228
I don't mind whatever you say.

406
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:20,760
Just tell me whether it
is truth or lie before saying it.

407
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:24,834
I didn't have any girlfriend
the day before yesterday.

408
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:27,875
I didn't have any
girlfriend even yesterday.

409
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:31,978
And no one till today morning.

410
00:19:32,348 --> 00:19:33,372
It's enough. Get down.

411
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:36,812
Today also no girlfriend. - Oh!

412
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,078
We reached the apartments.

413
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:40,748
Oh!

414
00:19:43,426 --> 00:19:44,552
This isn't Delhi.

415
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,725
If you have any phone number..

416
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:53,789
Hey, Srinu! - Yes?

417
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:55,386
Do you have pen or pencil?

418
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,089
Why would I have such things?

419
00:20:58,368 --> 00:20:59,835
You can take a piece
of coal if you want.

420
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:03,101
How? - You remember
the first four digits.

421
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:04,503
I will remember the last four.

422
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:05,437
Thank you very much.

423
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:07,371
Uncle?

424
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:12,380
I agreed to your trip thinking that
you might like going to beach and enjoy.

425
00:21:12,482 --> 00:21:13,608
Uncle! - You'll be fine.

426
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:15,443
You will pass time
for two months and go.

427
00:21:15,618 --> 00:21:17,813
But I am the one who stays here.

428
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,787
I understood, uncle.
- I don't think that you will misbehave.

429
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,753
But it is better to be cautious.

430
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,852
Uncle!

431
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:26,321
What is it?

432
00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:29,257
Did you really remember
the last four digits for real?

433
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,873
Hey, you are over cooking it.

434
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:44,343
You are slow.

435
00:21:45,982 --> 00:21:48,246
Are you sad because you
couldn't note down her number?

436
00:21:48,618 --> 00:21:49,744
How did you know, aunt?

437
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:51,479
You have grown up now.

438
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:53,782
Don't you know that you should
carry a cell phone with you?

439
00:21:54,457 --> 00:21:57,449
It's alright.
You can use my cell phone while here.

440
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:01,292
What happened now? Why are you crying?

441
00:22:01,698 --> 00:22:05,293
Had you given it yesterday,
I would have noted her number.

442
00:22:06,602 --> 00:22:10,402
By the way do you think
I can see her tomorrow?

443
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:12,331
Why are you so desperate?

444
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,804
Nothing like that.

445
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:18,070
Delhi girl in our apartment!
Just curious.

446
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:19,813
She is Mrs. Rukmini's granddaughter.

447
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:21,916
Her parents are having some fight.

448
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:23,550
That is why they sent her here.

449
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:25,186
She is very nice girl.

450
00:22:25,555 --> 00:22:27,284
Go and give these rotis to your uncle.

451
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:30,954
I don't understand
uncle's behaviour at all.

452
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,989
He is suffering a lot
because of sugar problem.

453
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:50,644
Hey, Venki! Venki!

454
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,681
Please bring half litre milk.

455
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,248
Why don't you ask the
milkman to deliver at home?

456
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:57,717
Hey, go and bring it.

457
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:16,605
Oh, is that you?

458
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:18,034
I was waiting for you.

459
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:19,706
What for? Is it for movie?

460
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:20,967
Aren't you ashamed?

461
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,010
I thought you were a nice
guy and gave you phone number.

462
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:24,804
How dare you give me
eleven blank calls at night?

463
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,278
Do you know what a
disturbance it is for others?

464
00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:28,910
Me?! I don't even remember your number.

465
00:23:29,018 --> 00:23:29,677
Shut up!

466
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:31,943
It is my mistake to give
my number to a person like you.

467
00:23:39,228 --> 00:23:41,822
Hey, how dare you make
eleven miss calls at night..

468
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:42,828
..and blame me for that?

469
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:44,729
She gave that number to me.
Why did you write it down?

470
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:45,730
How dare you?

471
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:47,632
Krishna taught Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna.

472
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:49,637
Aren't we all had
it printed and reading?

473
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:51,536
This is also same. Self satisfaction.

474
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:53,334
How dare you write her number down..

475
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:56,240
..make eleven blank calls
and shift the blame on me?

476
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:57,505
Forgive me, sir. Please!

477
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,717
If you do such stupid things again..

478
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:07,284
..I will kill you.

479
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:17,758
Sorry.

480
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:19,965
Anyone who knows my number..

481
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:21,634
..tries to call me a lot.

482
00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:24,634
This happened many times before.

483
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:27,899
Those blank calls were from..

484
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,169
..that Srinu. I am Gemini!

485
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:32,744
I am a bit short tempered.

486
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:34,541
Please don't mind.

487
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:37,814
Gemini means your birthday is June..
- May 31st.

488
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:39,845
Oh!

489
00:24:45,461 --> 00:24:47,827
Sorry! - What for?

490
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,097
It is true that Srinu
is the one who made..

491
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,428
..those blank calls
the day before yesterday.

492
00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:54,670
But it is I who made
12 blank calls yesterday.

493
00:24:56,072 --> 00:24:58,734
I was afraid to say anything.
So I hung up.

494
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:02,234
I am Vergo. So a bit coward.

495
00:25:02,512 --> 00:25:03,740
Please don't mind. - What?

496
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:05,874
Virgo! August 26th.

497
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:13,082
Hi! I want to ask
you something personal.

498
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,723
What gift did dad give on
your birthday and how did you feel?

499
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:16,883
He gave me a teddy bear.

500
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:19,587
Stupid gift but since Shekar gave it,
I was thrilled.

501
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:21,288
Sandhya!

502
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:23,930
What gift did your boyfriend
gave on your birthday?

503
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:25,598
Lokesh gave me a cellphone.

504
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:27,699
Sailesh gave the red shirt.

505
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,335
Rupesh gave MP3 player.

506
00:25:29,472 --> 00:25:29,904
Anyone else?

507
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:32,337
Take her to a five
star restaurant for dinner.

508
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:34,874
Tell her that diamonds
are girls best friend..

509
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,774
..and gift her some nice diamond set.

510
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:38,107
Oh, diamonds?

511
00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:39,238
Do you mean diamonds in cards?

512
00:25:39,382 --> 00:25:40,906
Diamond king and queen. - Shut up!

513
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,618
You liked a girl for the first time.
Can't you do that?

514
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:45,311
Yeah! Yeah! Hey, listen.

515
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:47,919
Can I take her to dinner
without diamond set?

516
00:25:48,024 --> 00:25:49,389
Hey, you are hopeless.

517
00:25:49,525 --> 00:25:51,117
Okay! Okay! I got it.

518
00:26:01,804 --> 00:26:02,998
Venki!

519
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:05,436
Grandpa's train will be missed.

520
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:08,166
We have to go to the station.
Bring the auto.

521
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,572
Hey, auto! Would you come
to the station? - Do you want me?

522
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:14,473
What will you take? - Money.

523
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:16,948
I mean how much? - Sixty rupees, sir.

524
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:18,611
Okay, come on.

525
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:22,448
He likes us a lot.

526
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,492
Yes, he do. - By the way..

527
00:26:24,827 --> 00:26:26,351
How much did you pay for auto?

528
00:26:26,796 --> 00:26:28,491
Hundred rupees, uncle.

529
00:26:28,764 --> 00:26:30,254
Hundred?

530
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,467
Four hundred and seventy, uncle.

531
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:33,694
For fixing a fan?

532
00:26:33,836 --> 00:26:36,100
Eleven hundred and fifty.
- For provisions?

533
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,034
It is seven hundred and ninety.

534
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,969
He didn't give the bill. - Let it be.

535
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:43,507
I am happy that he didn't ask for fine.
- He did, uncle.

536
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:45,012
Thirteen hundred and fifty, uncle.

537
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:46,771
But cylinder is three hundred only.

538
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:47,940
I got it in black.

539
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,449
Nine hundred and ninety
five rupees, uncle.

540
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:51,349
Change. - It's okay. You are young.

541
00:26:51,454 --> 00:26:52,716
Keep it.

542
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:53,616
Thanks, uncle.

543
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:16,901
"What is this feeling in my heart?"

544
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,214
"Why my heart beat increased?"

545
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:23,584
"This typhoon that started inside.."

546
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:26,951
"..but cannot hear
slightest sound outside."

547
00:27:27,556 --> 00:27:30,423
"What is this feeling in my heart?"

548
00:27:30,926 --> 00:27:33,759
"Why my heart beat increased?"

549
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,063
"This typhoon that started inside.."

550
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:40,600
"..but cannot hear
slightest sound outside."

551
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,688
"I cannot think of it.."

552
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:07,557
"..as a big problem either."

553
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,690
"What is the need to hide.."

554
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,292
"..when I enjoy this feeling?"

555
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,035
"When you touch casually.."

556
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,938
"..or do something unknowingly.."

557
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:24,012
"..it feels all okay.."

558
00:28:24,313 --> 00:28:28,272
"..and my heart surrenders
to you silently."

559
00:28:28,384 --> 00:28:31,217
"What is this feeling in my heart?"

560
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:34,584
"Why my heart beat increased?"

561
00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:38,083
"This typhoon that started inside.."

562
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:41,952
"..but cannot hear
slightest sound outside."

563
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:14,359
"This happiness that
I never experienced before.."

564
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:21,132
"..made me forget everything else."

565
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:24,868
"This is the way of romance."

566
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:27,840
"That our heart is
asking us to understand."

567
00:29:27,977 --> 00:29:31,140
"This is something
our heart encounters.."

568
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,182
"..and drives us mad saying
not to waste this boon."

569
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:38,150
"What is this feeling in my heart?"

570
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:41,887
"Why my heart beat increased?"

571
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:44,789
"This typhoon that started inside.."

572
00:29:45,027 --> 00:29:48,326
"..but cannot hear
slightest sound outside."

573
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:51,595
"What is this feeling in my heart?"

574
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:54,999
"Why my heart beat increased?"

575
00:29:55,538 --> 00:29:58,473
"This typhoon that started inside.."

576
00:29:58,574 --> 00:30:01,873
"..but cannot hear
slightest sound outside."

577
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:30,596
Hello?

578
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:33,641
I am bored.

579
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:35,068
Is that so?

580
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:38,746
Why are you laughing? I am bored.

581
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,906
Bore?

582
00:30:40,683 --> 00:30:42,082
You have to dig ninety feet.

583
00:30:42,484 --> 00:30:44,475
Oh, is anyone with you?

584
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,778
Yes.

585
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:47,218
Yes, just next to it. You can dig.

586
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,456
Why don't you come aside and speak?

587
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:53,854
No matter where you dig,
you will find water.

588
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,057
Water! - Then come to my house.

589
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:58,594
There is no one at home.

590
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:01,198
So, how long will you take to come?

591
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:03,532
Dig more. Ten..

592
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,730
You will get it in ten minutes. Okay?

593
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:11,237
Where are you going?

594
00:31:11,647 --> 00:31:14,081
I cannot see this program.

595
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:18,143
My dear! Would tension
ease if we spray scent?

596
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:26,151
Did you swim in scent?

597
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:28,821
Isn't this too much? Hold your nose.

598
00:31:28,964 --> 00:31:30,932
Your face is nice only. Come inside.

599
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:51,548
I was getting mad with boredom.
That is why I called you.

600
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:54,146
You should called me
after you are completely mad.

601
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,017
We would have had a
lot of topics to talk then.

602
00:31:56,158 --> 00:31:58,786
Stop it! I remembered
you when I felt boredom.

603
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:02,220
I didn't know my
name is so entertaining.

604
00:32:02,665 --> 00:32:04,792
Your name is normal but you are..

605
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:06,193
..entertaining.

606
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:13,301
Without thinking that we will be in
youth someday, we were given old names.

607
00:32:14,043 --> 00:32:15,476
Prabhavati Venkateswara Rao.

608
00:32:15,577 --> 00:32:17,238
Hey, didn't you like my name?

609
00:32:17,513 --> 00:32:19,310
But it is you who said that.

610
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:22,814
If it is really a problem,
why don't you change it?

611
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:25,179
I don't like changing my name.

612
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:26,712
Okay, I have an idea.

613
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:28,653
You just marry a guy with good name.

614
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:30,088
Then his name will
join next to your name.

615
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:32,689
Okay. Good idea. Suggest a name.

616
00:32:34,396 --> 00:32:35,454
You are from Delhi.

617
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:40,829
Find some Singh.

618
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:42,463
Prabhavati Singh.

619
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,539
What about Dubay? Prabhavati Dubay?

620
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,142
Or else Prabhavati..

621
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:52,038
Bhattacharya?

622
00:32:52,548 --> 00:32:53,606
Kolkatta!

623
00:32:56,585 --> 00:32:57,916
Prabhavati Prabhakaran, Chennai.

624
00:32:58,754 --> 00:33:00,119
Two times 'Prabha'?

625
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:02,085
It is very bad.

626
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:08,424
Okay.

627
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:11,058
Prabhavati Sharma?

628
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,731
Varma? Malhotra?

629
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:16,063
Maharotra?

630
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:17,700
Khan? Khanna?

631
00:33:19,742 --> 00:33:20,674
Suksena!

632
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,340
Prabhavati Suksena!

633
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:24,305
It is very sexy!

634
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:25,740
Venki!

635
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,779
Why don't you say some
entertaining name like yours?

636
00:33:31,153 --> 00:33:33,314
Then Prabhavati..

637
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:35,850
..Venkateswar. How is it? - No!

638
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:38,552
It is like combination
of Maheswari Parameswari.

639
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:47,434
Should I tell you a truth?

640
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:52,105
I didn't like..

641
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,031
..my name a lot earlier.

642
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:59,006
But when you call it, I feel it is nice.

643
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:00,146
Why is that?

644
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:04,282
Because.. - Why is that?

645
00:34:04,787 --> 00:34:06,118
Because..

646
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:10,518
Why is that? - Because..

647
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:12,821
Hold the pinky!

648
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:14,819
What?! - Pinky, Venki!

649
00:34:33,749 --> 00:34:35,216
It is getting late.

650
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,107
I have to go. - Good night.

651
00:34:38,754 --> 00:34:39,812
When will we meet again?

652
00:34:43,826 --> 00:34:47,455
It has been many days since
I am here but I didn't go to beach yet.

653
00:34:49,264 --> 00:34:50,663
Will you take me to the beach?

654
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:51,993
If you ask..

655
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:53,360
..I will definitely
take you to the beach.

656
00:34:54,603 --> 00:34:56,195
I know every part in the beach.

657
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,629
My friends call me son of the beach.

658
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:42,038
This is the first time..

659
00:36:42,644 --> 00:36:43,872
..I visited a beach in my life.

660
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:46,847
So, coming to beach for the first time..

661
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,947
..how do you feel? - Feel sad!

662
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:49,876
Huh?

663
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:51,849
Since I cannot come to
beach for the first time again.

664
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,723
My granny always tells me..

665
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:08,692
..that my feet resembles
a lot like my mother's.

666
00:37:19,514 --> 00:37:21,038
What is the problem between us?

667
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:23,281
There is no problem.

668
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,848
Marriage at an younger age..

669
00:37:27,522 --> 00:37:28,682
No problem.

670
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,457
What about your parents?
- Mother is house wife..

671
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,796
My father is my role model.

672
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:40,959
He was a big TV celebrity once.

673
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:42,726
He was a news reader in Dooradarshan.

674
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:45,667
His popularity was very big.

675
00:37:46,008 --> 00:37:48,476
He loved his job a lot.

676
00:37:48,777 --> 00:37:51,371
But after the introduction of cable TV..

677
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,315
Oh.. so you too want
to become TV news reader.

678
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:57,475
Right? - No.

679
00:37:57,886 --> 00:37:59,478
I want to become famous news reader.

680
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:02,383
It is a dream of me and also my parents.

681
00:38:02,724 --> 00:38:05,022
Ajanta toothbrush for mom..

682
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:07,661
..dad.. - Hey! - Brother.. - Hey!

683
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:09,060
And also mine.

684
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,958
By the way what do you want to become?

685
00:38:12,401 --> 00:38:13,561
I am very practical.

686
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:16,293
I keep my foot on ground always.
- I am a dreamer.

687
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:18,205
My eyes always looks into the sky.

688
00:38:18,874 --> 00:38:20,774
Coconut? - Okay.

689
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,352
Hello? - Venki..

690
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:41,259
Is it Prabhavati? - Yes.

691
00:38:42,264 --> 00:38:43,595
Venki is here.

692
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:46,534
Your mother. - Mom?!

693
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,971
Mom, her birthday is not today.

694
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:52,766
Tomorrow.
I will call you again. Hang up.

695
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:59,943
Would you tell your mom
about every girl you meet?

696
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:01,541
Not about everyone.

697
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:04,016
By the way..

698
00:39:04,453 --> 00:39:05,750
..I want to meet you
tomorrow morning again.

699
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,146
What for?

700
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:08,549
I think you forgot.

701
00:39:09,324 --> 00:39:11,417
Tomorrow is your birthday. - O God!

702
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:12,356
How did you know?

703
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:13,892
I heard it in the TV news.

704
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,255
19th birthday celebrations of U.
Prabhavati from Delhi..

705
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,162
..will be celebrated
grandly at Vizag tomorrow.

706
00:39:19,267 --> 00:39:21,428
Her friend and neighbour N.
Venkateswara Rao..

707
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,502
Stop it.

708
00:39:23,271 --> 00:39:25,398
I remembered.
I told you in the lift that day.

709
00:39:25,507 --> 00:39:26,496
Your birthday..

710
00:39:26,608 --> 00:39:29,099
..I should be the first
one to wish you and also meet you.

711
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:31,603
What for? - Because I like you.

712
00:39:32,314 --> 00:39:33,372
I like you too.

713
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:37,417
I love you..

714
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:40,386
I love like you.

715
00:39:40,989 --> 00:39:42,752
Hi, baby! We love you.

716
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,220
Darling!

717
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:53,726
Prabha, just a moment.

718
00:39:53,935 --> 00:39:54,902
I will be back in a moment.

719
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:06,845
Where are the people
who commented Prabhavati?

720
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:14,779
Did you see how strong they are?

721
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,549
Like the stunt masters in movies.

722
00:40:18,493 --> 00:40:19,983
They are also same.

723
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:25,192
They definitely are good fighters.

724
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:28,269
Terrible! - Will you shut your mouth?

725
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:37,938
I have to get down in the next floor.

726
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:39,237
Just come up once.

727
00:40:39,414 --> 00:40:41,678
I will do the first aid.
You can go when pain goes.

728
00:40:42,884 --> 00:40:44,249
What if it takes three days?

729
00:40:44,352 --> 00:40:45,785
It's alright. You can stay.

730
00:40:47,355 --> 00:40:49,789
What if it take the entire life?

731
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:11,873
I told you not to get
involved in silly things.

732
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:18,283
She lives in fourth floor.

733
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:20,216
Don't bend too much. You will fall.

734
00:41:26,094 --> 00:41:27,152
Hi, dad!

735
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,572
Happy birthday. - Thank you.

736
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:48,279
I am the first one, right?

737
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:50,784
Happy birthday. And the second one too.

738
00:41:51,086 --> 00:41:52,815
Yes. - Happy birthday.

739
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:54,147
I am third.

740
00:41:57,425 --> 00:41:58,449
Come on, let us celebrate.

741
00:41:59,027 --> 00:42:00,927
I have planned a surprise today evening.

742
00:42:01,229 --> 00:42:03,163
Please, Venki! I don't like it.

743
00:42:03,431 --> 00:42:04,523
Hey, Prabha..

744
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:05,997
Prabha!

745
00:42:06,368 --> 00:42:07,494
Prabha! Prabha! Please!

746
00:42:07,702 --> 00:42:08,760
Listen to me, please!

747
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:12,133
Prabha! Please!

748
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,665
Don't deny! - No.

749
00:42:13,808 --> 00:42:15,435
I was planning this for a month now.

750
00:42:15,544 --> 00:42:16,602
Please! Prabha!

751
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,042
Please, Prabha! Please!

752
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:19,669
Please! Please! Please! - Oh!

753
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:21,741
Okay.

754
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,311
Seriously? - Yeah!

755
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:24,112
Yeah!

756
00:42:25,554 --> 00:42:27,818
Hey! Venki!

757
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:33,586
Venki! Put me down.

758
00:42:33,895 --> 00:42:35,123
Put me down.

759
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:42,026
Wouldn't our prestige be ruined..

760
00:42:42,203 --> 00:42:44,330
..if anyone sees you? - Oh!

761
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,038
She asked me to find her weight, uncle.

762
00:42:46,174 --> 00:42:48,074
Nothing more than that.
- If she asks you to find the weight..

763
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:50,541
..you can give some approximate weight.

764
00:42:50,645 --> 00:42:52,374
But is it necessary to be so accurate?

765
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,845
Stop it now.

766
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:56,108
Thinking that it would be romantic..

767
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:57,616
..I asked him to find my weight.

768
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,653
He gave me Rs.1
and showed the weighing machine.

769
00:42:59,821 --> 00:43:01,220
Do you think everyone will be like you?

770
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:01,981
Auto!

771
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:03,090
How much do you take for station?

772
00:43:03,325 --> 00:43:04,622
Sixty rupees, sir.

773
00:43:05,327 --> 00:43:06,487
Sixty rupees?

774
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:08,294
He will agree to fifty if we ask.

775
00:43:08,496 --> 00:43:10,760
I doubted the moment you said hundred.

776
00:43:11,232 --> 00:43:13,860
Pulses, rice, salt, oil..

777
00:43:14,102 --> 00:43:17,469
..I was thinking why
everything was so costly.

778
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:19,439
All round figures.

779
00:43:19,774 --> 00:43:21,503
If everything in Vizag
becomes so costly..

780
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:24,476
..how a middle class man
like me can live. I was worried.

781
00:43:24,779 --> 00:43:26,508
So, all this is your scam.

782
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:28,715
Why do you like her so much?

783
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,981
Uncle! You scold me for taking money.

784
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:32,986
But I really like that girl.

785
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:34,281
You are thinking like that.

786
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:35,856
Why you like that girl..

787
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:37,925
..can you write ten
reasons for it on a paper?

788
00:43:39,761 --> 00:43:42,093
You cannot. Not only on the paper..

789
00:43:42,297 --> 00:43:43,389
..you cannot write it on slate too.

790
00:43:43,531 --> 00:43:44,657
Because there wouldn't be any.

791
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:47,257
I thought of writing
the same about your aunt.

792
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:49,367
I couldn't find more than three reasons.

793
00:43:49,537 --> 00:43:51,368
I couldn't find more than two.

794
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:53,269
Oh! - You don't have more
than five reasons in total.

795
00:43:53,842 --> 00:43:55,742
Then why did you get married?
- Because my dad didn't agree.

796
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,275
It would have been nice if he did.

797
00:43:57,379 --> 00:43:59,279
Please stop the vehicle, uncle.

798
00:43:59,381 --> 00:44:01,645
What for? - Stop first. I will tell you.

799
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,248
What is it?

800
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:12,319
Not ten, I can give you hundred reasons.

801
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,192
I wrote hundred reasons.

802
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:17,793
Is that true?

803
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:20,898
Come on, sing it to me.

804
00:44:38,453 --> 00:44:41,513
"I cannot say that.."

805
00:44:41,656 --> 00:44:44,784
"..I didn't see more
beautiful girls than her."

806
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:47,987
"But no matter how
many beauties I see.."

807
00:44:48,096 --> 00:44:51,190
"..my heart didn't
have this feeling before."

808
00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:54,393
"When I thought for reason,
I don't know.."

809
00:44:54,536 --> 00:44:57,596
"..why this happened
and is very confusing."

810
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:00,765
"My heart is listing
more than hundred reasons.."

811
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:04,003
"..one by one in detail."

812
00:45:04,112 --> 00:45:10,244
"Yahoo! Yahoo!"

813
00:45:10,385 --> 00:45:15,618
"Yahooooooo!"

814
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,884
"No matter if she gets angry.."

815
00:45:52,026 --> 00:45:55,052
"..or looked at me in anger.."

816
00:45:55,196 --> 00:45:59,724
"..I felt everything was wonderful."

817
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:02,703
"This is some kind of madness."

818
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:06,099
"I agree if anyone says that."

819
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:08,071
"But even then.."

820
00:46:08,176 --> 00:46:11,077
"I cannot stop my heart.."

821
00:46:11,212 --> 00:46:14,272
"..from loving her even more."

822
00:46:14,382 --> 00:46:17,283
"I like that madness.."

823
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,852
"..and I want to live with it."

824
00:46:20,955 --> 00:46:24,083
"I cannot say that.."

825
00:46:24,225 --> 00:46:27,285
"..I didn't see more
beautiful girls than her."

826
00:46:27,428 --> 00:46:30,522
"But no matter how
many beauties I see.."

827
00:46:30,632 --> 00:46:33,692
"..my heart didn't
have this feeling before."

828
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:56,149
"If everyone dreams about movie stars.."

829
00:46:56,257 --> 00:46:59,317
"..and want to marry only them.."

830
00:46:59,427 --> 00:47:03,761
"..I don't think there would
be so many happy couples in this world."

831
00:47:04,632 --> 00:47:09,001
"If you look at her with my eyes.."

832
00:47:09,103 --> 00:47:12,129
"..you will find that she
is the only beauty in this world."

833
00:47:12,273 --> 00:47:14,935
"Even if I say so,
if everyone wants to see.."

834
00:47:15,076 --> 00:47:18,170
"..her with my eyes,
I cannot allow that."

835
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:21,578
"I want to tell her
that she is only mine."

836
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:24,948
"But I am not able to say it to her."

837
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:28,181
"I cannot say that.."

838
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:31,383
"..I didn't see more
beautiful girls than her."

839
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:34,586
"But no matter how
many beauties I see.."

840
00:47:34,696 --> 00:47:37,790
"..my heart didn't
have this feeling before."

841
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:43,599
"Yahoo! Yahoo!"

842
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:49,435
"Yahoooooo!"

843
00:47:50,378 --> 00:47:53,472
"Yahoooooo!"

844
00:47:53,715 --> 00:47:56,912
"Yahoooooo!"

845
00:47:57,018 --> 00:48:03,548
"Yahoooooo!"

846
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:11,357
Oh, God!

847
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,000
When you give tip for
the server in front of her..

848
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:15,228
..you should show some dignity.

849
00:48:15,336 --> 00:48:16,564
Here, keep this money.

850
00:48:16,871 --> 00:48:18,338
Three rupees per reason..

851
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:20,930
..keep this three hundred with you.

852
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:32,413
Once again happy birthday, madam.

853
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,550
Thank you.

854
00:48:35,423 --> 00:48:36,481
I feel so good.

855
00:48:39,928 --> 00:48:41,020
You wanted to ask me something.

856
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:42,828
Yes.

857
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:49,196
Venki! You said you
want to ask something.

858
00:48:51,506 --> 00:48:53,872
Can you tell me which of these
two is salt and which is pepper?

859
00:48:56,911 --> 00:48:59,607
Did you spend so much money
for the party to ask this?

860
00:49:01,649 --> 00:49:03,913
If the holes are less it is salt
and it they are more then it is pepper.

861
00:49:04,986 --> 00:49:05,953
Is that so?

862
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:07,788
I thought salt would be salty..

863
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:09,579
..and pepper will be spicy.

864
00:49:11,859 --> 00:49:13,759
Come on! Ask it.

865
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:15,623
Do you think I would punch you?

866
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:21,860
Do you love me, Prabha?

867
00:49:22,637 --> 00:49:23,968
I will punch you.

868
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:28,333
That's true. I like you a lot.

869
00:49:28,676 --> 00:49:29,802
Me too.

870
00:49:30,878 --> 00:49:32,004
I like myself a lot.

871
00:49:34,816 --> 00:49:35,748
Come on, Prabha.

872
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,818
I know you understood
what I want to say.

873
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:40,078
I wait for the moment
to meet you everyday.

874
00:49:41,322 --> 00:49:43,153
Whenever my phone rings,
I think that it might be you.

875
00:49:43,624 --> 00:49:46,092
Hey! What do you want to say now?

876
00:49:49,964 --> 00:49:51,898
How would you name
the relation between us?

877
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:55,628
Is it necessary to name it?

878
00:49:58,106 --> 00:50:01,598
I like you.
That is true. You are special.

879
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:02,767
That is also true.

880
00:50:04,112 --> 00:50:06,137
Is it necessary to name that now?

881
00:50:06,314 --> 00:50:07,713
Do you mean I am just a friend to you?

882
00:50:08,149 --> 00:50:09,377
Best friend if you want.

883
00:50:11,586 --> 00:50:14,282
It isn't even an hour since
I cut my 19th birthday cake.

884
00:50:15,823 --> 00:50:19,156
It is not good to ask me
to decide about love or marriage.

885
00:50:19,627 --> 00:50:22,152
Such decisions are taken now only.
Not after you become old.

886
00:50:23,131 --> 00:50:24,428
Venki!

887
00:50:24,932 --> 00:50:27,059
Are all these necessary now?

888
00:50:27,935 --> 00:50:29,402
There is a lot of time for such things.

889
00:50:29,904 --> 00:50:31,735
So, what do you want us to do?

890
00:50:32,473 --> 00:50:34,634
Let us be in touch.
Let us see what happens in future.

891
00:50:35,143 --> 00:50:36,633
Let life unfold.

892
00:50:42,316 --> 00:50:43,578
I understood.

893
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:45,950
Is it Delhi culture?

894
00:50:46,754 --> 00:50:47,948
It is new to me.

895
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:51,955
Parties, pubs and picnics.

896
00:50:53,561 --> 00:50:56,029
Your parents do not
have enough time to fight.

897
00:50:56,931 --> 00:50:58,193
How can they think about you?

898
00:51:08,843 --> 00:51:10,708
Prabha! Prabha!

899
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:12,405
Prabha!

900
00:51:14,182 --> 00:51:15,240
I am sorry, Prabha.

901
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:16,678
Fine! Be sorry!

902
00:51:17,218 --> 00:51:19,709
Prabha! You will
be in Delhi by Saturday.

903
00:51:19,921 --> 00:51:21,445
I will be at Hyderabad by Sunday.

904
00:51:21,889 --> 00:51:23,686
These two.. at least these two days..

905
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:24,883
Prabha!

906
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,756
I am really sorry, Prabha!

907
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,598
I thought a lot last night.

908
00:51:32,934 --> 00:51:34,401
I behaved very foolishly.

909
00:51:35,236 --> 00:51:36,863
I think I don't have
the maturity that you have.

910
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,347
Prabhavati is not here.

911
00:51:47,615 --> 00:51:48,673
She went back to Delhi.

912
00:51:48,783 --> 00:51:49,909
Do you have any contact
number of her at Delhi?

913
00:51:50,051 --> 00:51:51,814
Delhi code is 011!

914
00:51:52,086 --> 00:51:54,281
Prabhavati told me
not to give you her number.

915
00:51:56,824 --> 00:51:59,952
Prabha!

916
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:13,365
This happened in 2009!

917
00:52:13,508 --> 00:52:15,635
It is very old story.
Don't you have any latest stories?

918
00:52:15,877 --> 00:52:18,175
Sir! This is the matter of love.

919
00:52:18,412 --> 00:52:20,539
I cannot think of second one.

920
00:52:20,648 --> 00:52:22,377
Okay. I have to go right from here.

921
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:23,709
Will you get down here?

922
00:52:26,154 --> 00:52:27,883
Let us meet at the office tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.

923
00:52:28,122 --> 00:52:29,180
Okay, sir.

924
00:52:51,112 --> 00:52:54,639
Once in olden days people went to God..

925
00:52:54,882 --> 00:52:57,112
I want to ask you..
- Sir! Do you want some buttermilk?

926
00:52:58,953 --> 00:53:00,580
Do you know what self
praising is called in English?

927
00:53:00,855 --> 00:53:02,015
Gasconade!

928
00:53:03,157 --> 00:53:07,491
Mr. Ravi Varma brought God to every
house through his paintings of God.

929
00:53:08,329 --> 00:53:09,921
Are you listening?

930
00:53:11,299 --> 00:53:13,665
Seriously. Are you listening?

931
00:53:14,168 --> 00:53:15,931
Do you want to have some tea, sir?

932
00:53:16,337 --> 00:53:18,328
Do you know the biggest word in English?

933
00:53:18,472 --> 00:53:20,269
I don't know, sir.
- Then don't bring tea.

934
00:53:20,374 --> 00:53:22,399
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

935
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:29,911
To our country.. to our country..

936
00:53:30,718 --> 00:53:31,844
To our country..

937
00:53:32,954 --> 00:53:34,216
To our country..

938
00:53:34,755 --> 00:53:36,746
To our country motion
picture was brought by..

939
00:53:36,857 --> 00:53:37,983
Dada Saheb Phalke..

940
00:53:38,092 --> 00:53:40,356
..Raja Ravi Varma.
Do you know about his assistant?

941
00:53:47,501 --> 00:53:50,937
This is a song from film 'Lofar'.
Music by Laxmikanth Pyarelal.

942
00:53:51,072 --> 00:53:52,164
Lyrics by Anand Bakshi.

943
00:53:52,273 --> 00:53:55,140
And singer is Md. Rafi.

944
00:53:55,543 --> 00:53:57,238
What is this Md. Rafi madness?

945
00:53:57,378 --> 00:53:58,402
Is he such a great singer?

946
00:53:58,546 --> 00:54:01,276
In the voice of Rafi sir..

947
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:04,416
..there was a magic..

948
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,950
..I cannot express it.

949
00:54:06,087 --> 00:54:09,284
Sir! Whether it is
Dilip Kumar or Dharmendra..

950
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:12,152
..when he sings for them, wow..

951
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,487
..when he sings then wow..

952
00:54:14,595 --> 00:54:15,892
What a traffic!

953
00:54:18,432 --> 00:54:20,195
Move fast! I have to go for lunch.

954
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:22,000
With my would be wife.

955
00:54:24,038 --> 00:54:25,630
I think you are bored.

956
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,932
Should I play some songs?

957
00:54:28,809 --> 00:54:30,174
Hey, what CD is this?

958
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:31,837
There will be many CD's in the car.

959
00:54:31,946 --> 00:54:32,776
It is better to play it.

960
00:54:36,217 --> 00:54:40,176
"Don't leave me in
a stage of restlessness."

961
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:44,314
"Please come back, I swear."

962
00:54:44,592 --> 00:54:46,617
Hey, do you like Md. Rafi?

963
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:49,525
Even I like Md. Rafi and his songs.

964
00:54:50,498 --> 00:54:54,127
When he sings then
the magic of his voice..

965
00:54:54,268 --> 00:54:55,963
What can I say?
- I want to tell you something.

966
00:54:56,237 --> 00:54:58,603
Oh, let me finish. Wait!

967
00:54:59,907 --> 00:55:02,102
It will feel like a thousand
violins are playing when he sings.

968
00:55:03,344 --> 00:55:06,370
The emotions that we have
buried in the depths of our heart..

969
00:55:06,614 --> 00:55:08,241
..will come up with overwhelming joy.

970
00:55:08,616 --> 00:55:13,212
It feels like the sadness of our
heart is blown away by a gust of wind.

971
00:55:13,854 --> 00:55:16,084
That song was sung by Hemanth Kumar.

972
00:55:17,758 --> 00:55:20,283
Hemanth.. - Yes.

973
00:55:20,995 --> 00:55:22,986
Hemanth Kumar? Who is he could be?

974
00:55:23,564 --> 00:55:26,294
This is Hemanth Kumar.
But Md. Rafi sings well.

975
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,765
Like violins and

976
00:55:28,469 --> 00:55:30,164
Removing sadness..

977
00:55:30,404 --> 00:55:32,872
"Please come back, I swear."

978
00:55:33,007 --> 00:55:35,168
To which restaurant are we going now?

979
00:55:35,843 --> 00:55:37,902
Welcome to Rinaessence, sir.
How can I help you?

980
00:55:38,145 --> 00:55:40,204
I have a reservation
under the name Udaya Bhaskar.

981
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:43,409
It's a Parsi restaurant.

982
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:45,775
Not that but I like to travel a lot.

983
00:55:48,889 --> 00:55:51,380
Travelling,
you know like ship, train, plane..

984
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:53,623
Good! Even I like travelling.

985
00:55:55,329 --> 00:55:56,796
What are the places did you see?

986
00:55:56,897 --> 00:56:00,264
Ashok Nagar,
Balnagar, Varasiguda, Chandrayangutta..

987
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:03,199
Funny! Are you joking?

988
00:56:03,604 --> 00:56:05,265
I thought you were serious.

989
00:56:06,307 --> 00:56:08,138
What are your likes and dislikes?

990
00:56:08,242 --> 00:56:09,436
Books! Books! - Oh!

991
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:11,701
Books? - I like to read a lot.

992
00:56:11,912 --> 00:56:13,937
In fact I brought
a book to gift you. - Oh!

00:56:18,919 --> 00:56:20,011

994
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:21,679
This book? - Yes.

995
00:56:22,556 --> 00:56:25,650
I mean you like travelling and..

996
00:56:25,793 --> 00:56:27,954
..I like books. So combining both..

997
00:56:28,596 --> 00:56:29,494
this..

998
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:35,166
Oh! Do you really like to read?

999
00:56:35,903 --> 00:56:37,632
Yes. - What is your favorite book?

1000
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,700
How can I name one?
I read a lot of books.

1001
00:56:43,344 --> 00:56:45,175
Did you read Roald Dahl books? - Yes.

1002
00:56:46,046 --> 00:56:48,947
What is your opinion?
- I think he is simply..

1003
00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:51,483
..supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

1004
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:53,849
What is it?
- I think I used very big words.

1005
00:56:54,288 --> 00:56:57,621
I do giving to my
sescopedal edges sometimes..

1006
00:56:57,825 --> 00:57:00,316
..but I like books and libraries.

1007
00:57:00,694 --> 00:57:01,752
And also universities.

1008
00:57:01,962 --> 00:57:03,987
In fact if I have two sons then..

1009
00:57:04,098 --> 00:57:05,793
..I will name them as
Nagarjuna and Venkateswara.

1010
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,524
Do you mean the movie
heroes names? - No.

1011
00:57:08,235 --> 00:57:09,395
I meant the universities.

1012
00:57:12,973 --> 00:57:14,770
Would you name Osmania if it is a girl?

1013
00:57:14,975 --> 00:57:16,169
Yeah, good idea.

1014
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:20,007
I names dog in our street
as KITS and cat as BITS.

1015
00:57:24,552 --> 00:57:27,112
"Black clouds are forming.."

1016
00:57:27,288 --> 00:57:30,951
Hey, Raja Ravi Varma's painting is here.
I didn't observe it till now.

1017
00:57:32,026 --> 00:57:34,187
Do you like Raja Ravi Varma's paintings?

1018
00:57:34,361 --> 00:57:37,159
Of course!
I do want to too some gasconading..

1019
00:57:37,298 --> 00:57:39,596
..but in my college days
I was a good student by the way.

1020
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:42,725
I got a gold medal for
the thesis on world paintings.

1021
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:44,267
Really?! - Yeah.

1022
00:57:45,873 --> 00:57:48,398
That means you have a lot to tell me.

1023
00:57:48,642 --> 00:57:50,701
Yes. - Explain me about it.

1024
00:57:51,879 --> 00:57:53,540
Raja Ravi Varma, the painter prince..

1025
00:57:53,714 --> 00:57:55,113
Forget about things on the right..

1026
00:57:57,051 --> 00:58:00,543
Look at the breast look, they look
so unincombat by the time she was in..

1027
00:58:00,654 --> 00:58:03,054
..in olden days when everyone
was not allowed to enter the temples..

1028
00:58:03,157 --> 00:58:06,217
..to show people how the God looks, he
started to paint the pictures of Gods..

1029
00:58:06,327 --> 00:58:09,228
..and took the God to peoples houses.
He is great. - Hello, sir. -Yes.

1030
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:12,299
So, there are like
1220 web sites about him.

1031
00:58:12,833 --> 00:58:13,959
Master of arts.. hey!

1032
00:58:14,068 --> 00:58:15,558
Oh, no! - Bloody hell!

1033
00:58:15,703 --> 00:58:16,761
Sorry, sir! Sorry!

1034
00:58:17,071 --> 00:58:18,129
I am sorry.

1035
00:58:19,373 --> 00:58:21,238
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

1036
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:24,673
It's okay. It's okay.
I thought of this when I came here.

1037
00:58:24,812 --> 00:58:26,404
That it would have been
nice if we sit at different table.

1038
00:58:26,814 --> 00:58:28,509
Let's take another table.
- No, we have reservation.

1039
00:58:28,616 --> 00:58:30,140
We should sit here only. - Come on!

1040
00:58:30,317 --> 00:58:31,875
Restaurant is empty.

1041
00:58:32,353 --> 00:58:33,411
Excuse me!

1042
00:58:39,894 --> 00:58:42,863
You know what! I didn't like
water spilling on your clothes.

1043
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:44,930
Let us go to another restaurant.
Come on. - No! No!

1044
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:46,223
We are here.

1045
00:58:46,534 --> 00:58:49,697
If someone meet accident once,
does it means it happens always?

1046
00:58:50,271 --> 00:58:51,966
Let us sit here. I like this place.

1047
00:58:52,072 --> 00:58:53,596
Service here is also not good.

1048
00:58:53,707 --> 00:58:55,402
When I asked for fork once,
he pricked me with it.

1049
00:58:57,545 --> 00:58:59,342
Wow, Monalisa!

1050
00:59:01,315 --> 00:59:02,441
Is that her?

1051
00:59:02,816 --> 00:59:05,376
I am hungry.
Shall we order something? Please!

1052
00:59:05,486 --> 00:59:07,613
We can. Let the waiter come here.

1053
00:59:07,888 --> 00:59:09,583
What is your opinion
about this painting?

1054
00:59:17,431 --> 00:59:19,092
This painter do not have
the talent that Ravi Varma has.

1055
00:59:20,134 --> 00:59:21,965
Come on, Da vinci..

1056
00:59:22,069 --> 00:59:24,435
What?! - You know,
Da vinci is a mathematician..

1057
00:59:24,572 --> 00:59:27,564
..cum engineer cum sculptor cum..

1058
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:29,436
..writer cum musician..

1059
00:59:29,543 --> 00:59:31,738
..cum anatomist.. - Is he not a painter?

1060
00:59:33,113 --> 00:59:33,977
Monalisa!

1061
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:37,014
This is the painting that
inspired many poets around the world.

1062
00:59:37,751 --> 00:59:39,048
Is that true?

1063
00:59:39,453 --> 00:59:40,818
Can you say some poem?

1064
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:51,725
"Monalisa is my sister"

1065
00:59:53,434 --> 00:59:55,732
"Her smile is super."

1066
00:59:57,638 --> 00:59:59,572
"Come on, let us party."

1067
01:00:03,477 --> 01:00:05,035
"Who is this girl?"

1068
01:00:05,346 --> 01:00:06,973
"Where did she come from?"

1069
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:09,379
"What she gonna do to us all?"

1070
01:00:09,483 --> 01:00:10,973
"She broke my heart.. heart.."

1071
01:00:11,085 --> 01:00:12,450
Hey, Prabha! Did you like the guy?

1072
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,151
Just wait! Let her speak.
Prabha! Did you like the guy?

1073
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:18,823
I don't know.

1074
01:00:19,426 --> 01:00:21,621
What is the problem?
- No problem at all.

1075
01:00:21,895 --> 01:00:23,920
No problem means you liked him.

1076
01:00:24,064 --> 01:00:26,362
No, that means I cannot
say that I don't like him.

1077
01:00:27,601 --> 01:00:28,863
He seems to be a good guy.

1078
01:00:29,737 --> 01:00:32,331
But he tried a lot to impress me.

1079
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,840
His attempts kind
of nice at that moment..

1080
01:00:36,377 --> 01:00:38,106
..but I was scared
after a second thought.

1081
01:00:38,345 --> 01:00:39,744
Attempts?! - Yes.

1082
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:42,574
He tried to convince me
that we have same interests.

1083
01:00:43,183 --> 01:00:47,313
He tried to use big English words like
a student appearing for GRE coaching.

1084
01:00:47,588 --> 01:00:48,384
What is that?

1085
01:00:48,622 --> 01:00:50,749
If you cannot come to a conclusion,
what should I say to the mediator?

1086
01:00:52,393 --> 01:00:53,883
How can I marry him just
because you don't know..

1087
01:00:53,994 --> 01:00:55,894
..what to say to the mediator, brother?

1088
01:00:56,063 --> 01:00:58,531
He liked you a lot
when he first saw you.

1089
01:00:58,666 --> 01:01:00,634
Is it enough if he only likes me?

1090
01:01:01,335 --> 01:01:03,235
Marriage is one time event in this life.

1091
01:01:03,937 --> 01:01:07,134
I cannot take a decision
with just two hours of acquaintance.

1092
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:08,238
Listen, Prabha!

1093
01:01:08,342 --> 01:01:10,003
You just keep quiet. I will talk to her.

1094
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:13,673
Prabha! Do you want
us to look for more matches?

1095
01:01:13,914 --> 01:01:15,541
We cannot get a good match than this.

1096
01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:18,317
He is well educated and also rich.

1097
01:01:18,485 --> 01:01:20,146
I will see just one more match.

1098
01:01:20,888 --> 01:01:22,822
If that person is worse than this guy..

1099
01:01:23,123 --> 01:01:24,886
..I will marry this guy. Okay?

1100
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:28,221
Promise me that. - Promise!

1101
01:01:28,962 --> 01:01:29,860
Worse than this guy?!

1102
01:01:30,597 --> 01:01:31,529
Isn't it hard, sir?

1103
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:34,222
Can't we find one?

1104
01:01:34,935 --> 01:01:36,095
I am out of ideas, Venki.

1105
01:01:36,737 --> 01:01:38,204
If Sirisha doesn't marry me..

1106
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:40,405
..I will close the channel
and go to Himalayas.

1107
01:01:40,641 --> 01:01:42,006
Sir, just listen to me.

1108
01:01:42,342 --> 01:01:44,173
I lost my impression
because I heard your advice.

1109
01:01:47,014 --> 01:01:49,380
What did I do, Mr.
Uday? Aren't there any other girls?

1110
01:01:49,683 --> 01:01:51,583
There are many other
girls out there. - No.

1111
01:01:52,352 --> 01:01:54,081
I tried a lot already.

1112
01:01:54,521 --> 01:01:56,045
Searched a lot.

1113
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:59,015
Looked a lot of girls.

1114
01:01:59,293 --> 01:02:01,261
There isn't anyone else.
This is the only girl.

1115
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:03,694
But she is not coming into my hands.

1116
01:02:04,398 --> 01:02:08,061
Mr. Uday!
Don't worry so much. I have an idea.

1117
01:02:08,535 --> 01:02:11,231
There will be many fools in our city.

1118
01:02:11,672 --> 01:02:13,606
Let us send one of them to her house.

1119
01:02:13,807 --> 01:02:15,434
After seeing him,
she will definitely marries you.

1120
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:16,907
Oh, no! I cannot risk.

1121
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:18,439
What if she likes him and marries him?

1122
01:02:20,114 --> 01:02:24,278
That's a good point.
But where can we find a loyal fool?

1123
01:02:25,786 --> 01:02:26,844
There is one.

1124
01:02:28,889 --> 01:02:30,049
Who is that fool?

1125
01:02:32,259 --> 01:02:33,419
It is you.

1126
01:02:33,894 --> 01:02:36,089
Since your future is in my hands..

1127
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:37,925
..I cannot do anything
if you think of betraying me.

1128
01:02:38,132 --> 01:02:41,226
Sir, I can give you advice
but don't involve me in this.

1129
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:44,699
Listen, Venkateswara Rao!
Think of this as a practice and do it.

1130
01:02:44,805 --> 01:02:48,206
What is this, sir? He is going to
play the game but I should do practice?

1131
01:02:48,475 --> 01:02:50,500
Venki! You are my loyal employee!

1132
01:02:50,944 --> 01:02:52,070
Can't you do this for me?

1133
01:02:52,212 --> 01:02:55,010
This is the correct opportunity
to show your respect for me.

1134
01:02:56,183 --> 01:02:59,084
Don't think I would plead you.
If you don't do what I say..

1135
01:03:03,824 --> 01:03:05,849
Sir! I have a small doubt.

1136
01:03:06,093 --> 01:03:08,357
What if I fall in love
with her in this process?

1137
01:03:08,495 --> 01:03:10,258
Then I would kill you.

1138
01:03:12,866 --> 01:03:14,697
What if she falls in love with me?

1139
01:03:14,835 --> 01:03:16,393
Then you will be killed by my hands.

1140
01:03:16,503 --> 01:03:18,232
Sir! Emotional blackmail wouldn't work.

1141
01:03:18,472 --> 01:03:21,532
Just because I am working with you..
- Venki! Venki, stop!

1142
01:03:22,276 --> 01:03:23,300
How dare you speak against me?

1143
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:25,810
I heard that you met
Gemini TV creative head.

1144
01:03:26,246 --> 01:03:27,406
You have attended the interview also.

1145
01:03:27,915 --> 01:03:30,475
He called me and enquired about you.

1146
01:03:30,717 --> 01:03:33,049
If I say anything bad about you..

1147
01:03:33,487 --> 01:03:34,476
..you will be finished.

1148
01:03:36,657 --> 01:03:37,919
If you prove yourself useful to me..

1149
01:03:38,158 --> 01:03:39,523
..I will give you news reader post.

1150
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,821
Are you trying to trap me with this?
- Hey, come with me.

1151
01:03:41,929 --> 01:03:43,726
Come with me. I have a work with you.

1152
01:03:45,065 --> 01:03:46,191
Listen, Venki!

1153
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,335
You need to adjust
in some circumstances.

1154
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,032
You have to.

1155
01:03:51,872 --> 01:03:53,965
You should choose wisely
about the circumstances.

1156
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:55,669
Are you suggesting to take his offer?

1157
01:03:55,843 --> 01:03:57,538
If you want the job of your choice..

1158
01:03:57,845 --> 01:04:00,245
..you should go around sometimes.

1159
01:04:00,581 --> 01:04:02,139
Attend marriage looks just for fun.

1160
01:04:02,349 --> 01:04:04,544
Otherwise you will lose
what you have and want.

1161
01:04:04,718 --> 01:04:05,582
Don't I have any other choice?

1162
01:04:05,686 --> 01:04:07,813
I don't think you have.

1163
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:08,979
First agree to this.

1164
01:04:09,723 --> 01:04:10,747
Venki!

1165
01:04:11,658 --> 01:04:13,023
I will count up to ten.

1166
01:04:13,694 --> 01:04:15,423
Ten! Nine!

1167
01:04:15,562 --> 01:04:16,961
Sir! - Eight! - Sir! Sir!

1168
01:04:17,197 --> 01:04:18,221
Seven! - Sir!

1169
01:04:18,398 --> 01:04:19,922
Don't do anything out of anger, sir.

1170
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:22,628
I will do any help you ask for.

1171
01:04:22,803 --> 01:04:28,241
In your plan to cheat and marry her,
I will give you my 100percent support.

1172
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:32,676
Don't mind that I held
your choler a while back.

1173
01:04:32,913 --> 01:04:36,212
What did you say, sir?
Why would he mind?

1174
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,213
You are his boss, so you can do that.

1175
01:04:38,352 --> 01:04:39,842
When are we going to start the project?

1176
01:04:40,587 --> 01:04:41,645
Immediately.

1177
01:05:00,173 --> 01:05:01,197
Plan of action.

1178
01:05:01,808 --> 01:05:03,969
First you should make me
eligible bachelor and send there.

1179
01:05:04,211 --> 01:05:05,439
I can take care of that.

1180
01:05:05,746 --> 01:05:08,544
Oh, then you will make her
believe that you are a complete fool.

1181
01:05:08,749 --> 01:05:11,309
She will marry me and
I can live happily with her.

1182
01:05:11,418 --> 01:05:12,077
Is that all? - No.

1183
01:05:12,185 --> 01:05:13,846
She will say that she
want to see another match.

1184
01:05:14,655 --> 01:05:15,713
That is why I asked you to be patient.

1185
01:05:16,056 --> 01:05:18,524
She will ask that guy
too to take her to dinner.

1186
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:20,356
Then I will behave
in a way that she likes.

1187
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:23,293
Then she will marry you and
I have to search for another girl.

1188
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:25,625
No, sir. I cannot find any for you.

1189
01:05:25,732 --> 01:05:27,757
Listen, sir!
When the matter moves ahead a bit..

1190
01:05:27,901 --> 01:05:29,835
..and she chose to marry me..

1191
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:31,835
..we will place some heartbreaking
things in front of her.

1192
01:05:31,972 --> 01:05:33,371
Then her heart will be broken.

1193
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,005
And she will decide not to marry anyone.

1194
01:05:35,175 --> 01:05:36,608
Then both of us will have
to search for new matches.

1195
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:39,144
Please don't speak about
searching for new matches, sir.

1196
01:05:40,113 --> 01:05:41,546
We do not completely break her heart,
Mr. Uday.

1197
01:05:41,682 --> 01:05:43,877
We will bring just a crack.

1198
01:05:45,185 --> 01:05:49,713
While I am trying to break her heart,
you should befriend her.

1199
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,792
When I move out of the scene,
she will approach you..

1200
01:05:52,893 --> 01:05:54,690
..and tell you that she
cannot find a good guy than you.

1201
01:05:54,795 --> 01:05:58,561
Then you can console her
that it is not a big thing..

1202
01:05:58,665 --> 01:05:59,859
..and forgive her.

1203
01:06:00,233 --> 01:06:03,725
Then you will get
married to her happily.

1204
01:06:03,904 --> 01:06:04,802
Huh!

1205
01:06:04,905 --> 01:06:06,372
Done? - Done! - Done!

1206
01:06:10,544 --> 01:06:12,978
Greetings, madam!
How are you? - Greetings! I am fine.

1207
01:06:13,347 --> 01:06:14,279
Have some coffee!

1208
01:06:16,717 --> 01:06:20,209
He has half acre land
at his native place.

1209
01:06:21,488 --> 01:06:23,888
Half acre is nothing these days.

1210
01:06:24,024 --> 01:06:24,786
Oh! - No!

1211
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:26,425
Reject! - Reject!

1212
01:06:26,693 --> 01:06:27,785
Look at him, sir.

1213
01:06:28,695 --> 01:06:30,595
His five sisters are educated.

1214
01:06:30,964 --> 01:06:33,398
But he is.. he is rich instead.

1215
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:35,362
Are his sisters married?

1216
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:37,302
First he will get married.. - No.

1217
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:39,598
No to this too. - Look at this, sir.

1218
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:43,142
This is second marriage
for him but he is rich.

1219
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:44,709
He love marriage attempt failed..

1220
01:06:45,112 --> 01:06:47,307
..so he wants to opt
for arranged marriage.

1221
01:06:47,414 --> 01:06:48,608
That means his first
marriage was a failure.

1222
01:06:48,749 --> 01:06:50,410
No, it was super hit.

1223
01:06:50,517 --> 01:06:53,213
He want to continue that.
- Reject this too.

1224
01:06:54,521 --> 01:06:55,613
Look at this, sir.

1225
01:06:57,157 --> 01:06:58,784
He looks handsome.

1226
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:00,220
Who is he?

1227
01:07:00,327 --> 01:07:01,760
He has finished his degree.

1228
01:07:01,862 --> 01:07:03,853
Works in a software
company and earns a lot.

1229
01:07:04,031 --> 01:07:06,522
Why did you show those stupid
matches when you have this?

1230
01:07:06,633 --> 01:07:09,067
You have selected it before
I came to that decision.

1231
01:07:09,269 --> 01:07:11,703
Since you have selected Venki,
she will be married to Mr. Uday.

1232
01:07:12,572 --> 01:07:13,231
What did you say?

1233
01:07:13,707 --> 01:07:16,039
I was saying just leave the rest to me.

1234
01:07:16,276 --> 01:07:17,368
Let me have some coffee first.

1235
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,113
Congratulations, sir.

1236
01:07:22,382 --> 01:07:25,840
I had arranged different
match for he girl your son liked.

1237
01:07:26,153 --> 01:07:29,452
I don't understand what you say.
Just get my son married. That's all.

1238
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:32,349
Hello! - Sir!

1239
01:07:32,492 --> 01:07:34,357
From the list I showed..

1240
01:07:34,561 --> 01:07:36,825
..they have selected our Venki.
- I am proud of my boy!

1241
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:39,457
I hope they didn't
see Venki in TV program.

1242
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,124
Who will watch that, sir?

1243
01:07:42,302 --> 01:07:45,294
Then search a good parents
for him and arrange marriage looks.

1244
01:07:46,807 --> 01:07:48,172
That is very complicated process.

1245
01:07:48,408 --> 01:07:50,069
Bringing a mother and father..

1246
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:51,575
..and teach acting to them..

1247
01:07:51,711 --> 01:07:53,975
..and then making them perform
correctly is very difficult.

1248
01:07:54,114 --> 01:07:55,877
Let us arrange marriage
looks in some place.

1249
01:07:56,249 --> 01:07:57,739
Just the guy and the girl.

1250
01:07:57,918 --> 01:07:59,180
Okay? - Okay.

1251
01:08:06,326 --> 01:08:08,556
Where did your brother keep the photo?

1252
01:08:09,062 --> 01:08:10,256
It's alright, sis-in-law.

1253
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:12,760
You said that you liked him.

1254
01:08:13,066 --> 01:08:15,796
And I like the name N. Venkateswara Rao.

1255
01:08:16,636 --> 01:08:19,571
What if you go without
seeing the photo and confuse?

1256
01:08:19,773 --> 01:08:20,671
Nothing will happen.

1257
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:22,474
Hello?

1258
01:08:22,576 --> 01:08:24,271
She will search for faults
if she sees this photo now.

1259
01:08:27,114 --> 01:08:28,308
Okay. Okay, sir.

1260
01:08:28,782 --> 01:08:30,249
Prabha! You can start.

1261
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:32,341
He will wear a blue
shirt and kakhi pant.

1262
01:08:32,953 --> 01:08:34,580
Is my sari okay? - Superb!

1263
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:40,885
Brother! Is he software side?

1264
01:08:41,461 --> 01:08:42,928
Isn't he news reader? - Deloitte!

1265
01:08:43,063 --> 01:08:44,530
Salary of 7lakh 20thousand.

1266
01:08:56,743 --> 01:08:58,608
Hello? Hello!

1267
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,404
I wore blue shirt and kakhi pant.

1268
01:09:01,882 --> 01:09:03,611
What is she wearing?

1269
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:06,576
Yellow?! Oh, yellow sari?

1270
01:09:06,953 --> 01:09:08,113
Okay, I will take care of it.

1271
01:09:12,058 --> 01:09:13,719
Nice shirt! - Thanks!

1272
01:09:13,927 --> 01:09:15,292
New one! My boss bought for me.

1273
01:09:15,662 --> 01:09:17,152
Did you come here to see
a girl for marriage? - Yes.

1274
01:09:17,364 --> 01:09:20,527
She is wearing a yellow sari and I
have to wear blue shirt and kakhi pant.

1275
01:09:20,634 --> 01:09:21,760
Oh, got it.

1276
01:09:22,102 --> 01:09:24,195
What a coincident.
I too came for that purpose.

1277
01:09:24,571 --> 01:09:26,596
Tomorrow! I can wear any color shirt.

1278
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,837
Is that why you wore such a shirt?

1279
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:40,347
My name is Chinta Gurumurthy.

1280
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,744
Her name is Swapna.

1281
01:09:42,155 --> 01:09:45,056
Nice meeting you.
- My name is Venki. Her name is Sirisha.

1282
01:09:46,193 --> 01:09:47,251
Boss's name is Uday.

1283
01:09:55,969 --> 01:09:58,130
NRI! I went to US on L1 and..

1284
01:09:58,438 --> 01:10:00,099
..changed to H1 recently.

1285
01:10:00,373 --> 01:10:02,000
Oh, is that good, sir?

1286
01:10:02,275 --> 01:10:04,072
Yes. Next is green card.

1287
01:10:04,277 --> 01:10:05,039
Oh!

1288
01:10:07,414 --> 01:10:10,383
For the safety and health
of Chinta Gurumurthy..

1289
01:10:10,517 --> 01:10:11,848
..this is an offering made to God.

1290
01:10:12,018 --> 01:10:13,110
Why did you come to this temple now?

1291
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,949
I visit temple occasionally
and ask the God to fulfill my dreams.

1292
01:10:17,057 --> 01:10:18,149
That is called worship.

1293
01:10:18,258 --> 01:10:20,954
Even the God tells me what I have to do.

1294
01:10:21,428 --> 01:10:23,055
That is called madness. - Mad?!

1295
01:10:25,165 --> 01:10:26,325
What do you do, sir?

1296
01:10:26,566 --> 01:10:27,726
Didn't you get visa?

1297
01:10:27,834 --> 01:10:29,699
I don't have the idea of going to US.

1298
01:10:29,803 --> 01:10:31,930
It is difficult.. not easy you know?

1299
01:10:32,138 --> 01:10:32,968
Just see me now

1300
01:10:33,106 --> 01:10:35,097
Struggled hard in SAP in India..

1301
01:10:35,242 --> 01:10:36,675
You did SAP? - Yes

1302
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:39,335
You should call it S.A.P

1303
01:10:39,579 --> 01:10:40,603
What does it mean?

1304
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,212
Don't know exactly.. it is something..

1305
01:10:43,383 --> 01:10:44,441
I think it is German

1306
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:46,548
Leave me alone.. I am a bit tense

1307
01:10:49,489 --> 01:10:51,684
Why be tense? It'll be set

1308
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:53,858
It shouldn't be set..
mine is a long story

1309
01:10:54,427 --> 01:10:56,224
My things should get set..
mine is a normal story

1310
01:10:56,529 --> 01:10:58,156
I want apply for H1 visa soon

1311
01:11:03,903 --> 01:11:05,097
Wow!

1312
01:11:30,463 --> 01:11:32,624
Hello.. I didn't see his photo

1313
01:11:33,533 --> 01:11:35,000
Didn't he see my photo either?

1314
01:11:36,102 --> 01:11:38,195
Ok then.. I'll look for the blue shirt

1315
01:12:13,707 --> 01:12:15,641
The one in the yellow saree..
her name is Prabhavati

1316
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:18,002
Surname starts with 'U'.
Born and brought up in Delhi

1317
01:12:18,311 --> 01:12:19,073
Native place is Vizag

1318
01:12:19,179 --> 01:12:22,740
Her date of birth is May31st 1989..
Zodiac sign is Gemini

1319
01:12:23,316 --> 01:12:25,284
Her name is not Prabhavati but Sirisha..

1320
01:12:25,552 --> 01:12:27,952
Her full name is Sri
Sai Sirisha Prabhavati

1321
01:12:28,054 --> 01:12:29,351
How do you know all this?

1322
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:31,150
Why didn't you tell me
all these details earlier?

1323
01:12:31,257 --> 01:12:34,192
Even a man who wants to
marry won't seek so many details

1324
01:12:34,394 --> 01:12:36,021
Does she know any details
about me by the way?

1325
01:12:36,162 --> 01:12:37,993
It seems she didn't see your photo even

1326
01:12:38,164 --> 01:12:39,324
She knows only your name

1327
01:12:39,532 --> 01:12:40,965
Ok.. I'll face my troubles

1328
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:42,125
Ok.. do so

1329
01:12:54,714 --> 01:12:56,648
Your name is.. - N Venkateswara Rao

1330
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:58,176
Is that the correct name?

1331
01:12:58,418 --> 01:13:00,215
Oh.. is it you? - Yes

1332
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,652
I'm Sirisha.. nice name!

1333
01:13:03,123 --> 01:13:05,148
Your name is very nice.. - So nice?!

1334
01:13:05,358 --> 01:13:06,882
Is better than Chinta Gurumurty?

1335
01:13:06,993 --> 01:13:08,221
I don't mean that

1336
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:10,452
A friend of mine too has
the name N Venkateswara Rao

1337
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:12,559
So there are two persons
with the same name

1338
01:13:12,866 --> 01:13:15,027
There are three of them..
the third one too is here abouts

1339
01:13:15,235 --> 01:13:16,725
Is it ok for you if
kids get educated in US?

1340
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:19,998
Why am I bothered where
your kids get educated? - Ah?

1341
01:13:22,308 --> 01:13:23,832
I'll make a short call and return

1342
01:13:28,481 --> 01:13:31,006
Hello father.. please cancel
the marriage proposal tomorrow

1343
01:13:31,618 --> 01:13:33,176
I have chosen a girl already

1344
01:13:33,586 --> 01:13:34,644
I think she's the one

1345
01:13:35,021 --> 01:13:37,182
Father.. if anyone pings from office..

1346
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:39,690
..reply with BRB..
it is work from home anyways

1347
01:13:40,093 --> 01:13:42,687
Hey.. why are you overplaying
the role given to you?

1348
01:13:42,829 --> 01:13:44,160
You don't want it anyway

1349
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:45,797
Let me make my efforts

1350
01:13:46,032 --> 01:13:48,466
I'll take along on H4 for now..
and then through my consultant..

1351
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:49,966
SAP.. oh, sorry!

1352
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,161
I'll get trained on S.A.P
and get it converted to H1

1353
01:13:52,305 --> 01:13:54,034
One can earn upto 75 dollars per hour

1354
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:56,199
That's good income in Edison..
the school district is also good.

1355
01:13:56,342 --> 01:13:58,970
You are a great planner..
but do what you are told for now

1356
01:13:59,212 --> 01:14:01,077
If you play out the role without reading
the script.. this is what results

1357
01:14:01,214 --> 01:14:03,273
I am trying to help,
but you are not giving me any freedom

1358
01:14:03,483 --> 01:14:04,347
Let's go

1359
01:14:07,387 --> 01:14:08,354
Sorry madam - What?

1360
01:14:08,755 --> 01:14:09,653
You are not my type

1361
01:14:09,956 --> 01:14:11,753
Don't feel bad that
I'm saying this in your face

1362
01:14:11,858 --> 01:14:13,325
But just a minute ago..

1363
01:14:13,693 --> 01:14:15,160
Had we met a minute ago..

1364
01:14:15,662 --> 01:14:17,129
..the result would
have been something else

1365
01:14:17,597 --> 01:14:18,859
You.. what?!

1366
01:14:20,525 --> 01:14:22,079
Alas!

1367
01:14:26,739 --> 01:14:28,001
Hello, father!

1368
01:14:29,309 --> 01:14:30,207
I just broke up!

1369
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:31,834
Hey Prabha..
how did he say that he didn't like you?

1370
01:14:31,978 --> 01:14:33,468
We never expected such an outcome

1371
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:36,310
Even I too didn't
feel like talking to him

1372
01:14:36,483 --> 01:14:37,507
But, how arrogant he is!

1373
01:14:37,717 --> 01:14:40,208
If he didn't like you,
he should have found some excuse

1374
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,117
How dare he tell you in the face!

1375
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:52,363
What are you thinking about, Prabha?

1376
01:14:52,732 --> 01:14:54,495
I should speak to him once more

1377
01:14:55,401 --> 01:14:57,801
But he said he didn't like you

1378
01:14:58,505 --> 01:15:00,666
Is it enough if he is the
only one who doesn't like this?

1379
01:15:00,907 --> 01:15:01,999
What do you mean?!

1380
01:15:11,484 --> 01:15:13,975
You said you would take only 15 min..
- I had to fill petrol

1381
01:15:14,153 --> 01:15:16,087
Why are you so angry?
Didn't check the zero?

1382
01:15:16,389 --> 01:15:19,847
No, I didn't..
neither for petrol nor for marriage!

1383
01:15:21,995 --> 01:15:23,326
Hey, sit here..

1384
01:15:24,931 --> 01:15:26,558
That's a 5-year old issue, Venky!

1385
01:15:26,933 --> 01:15:30,630
What is the point in
raking up age old matters?

1386
01:15:30,803 --> 01:15:32,964
What is the guarantee
that she still likes you?

1387
01:15:33,172 --> 01:15:35,504
That she is ready to seek
other marriage proposals..

1388
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:36,936
..don't you realize what it means?

1389
01:15:37,443 --> 01:15:38,876
If I meet her once,
the matter will be resolved

1390
01:15:38,978 --> 01:15:40,741
What about the other issues around you?

1391
01:15:41,314 --> 01:15:43,942
One shouldn't be afraid in
love or shouldn't fall in love at all

1392
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:46,847
But if the one you love is your
boss' love too, you better keep mum..

1393
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:50,012
But she was so disheartened
to see that man with same name as me

1394
01:15:50,723 --> 01:15:53,749
What is the guarantee that
she won't be disheartened to see you?

1395
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,027
Venky, marriage happens
only when both like each other

1396
01:15:57,297 --> 01:15:59,094
But if two people like the same person,
trouble happens

1397
01:15:59,299 --> 01:16:00,994
But it is me who that girl likes

1398
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:05,403
Think hard about this, Venky

1399
01:16:05,972 --> 01:16:08,338
If things go wrong, you could
lose both the girl and your job!

1400
01:16:09,075 --> 01:16:11,236
Take my advice and let go of her

1401
01:16:12,545 --> 01:16:15,810
There is no cure for
love like we have for headache

1402
01:16:16,182 --> 01:16:17,649
Love is like pneumonia, Venky

1403
01:16:18,051 --> 01:16:19,882
It is cured in 3 days even
if you don't take any medicine

1404
01:16:20,286 --> 01:16:21,878
One has to keep blowing
the nose till then

1405
01:16:22,355 --> 01:16:23,447
I am not going to sit quiet

1406
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,590
I think, I still love her

1407
01:16:32,065 --> 01:16:33,930
It is fine that you
feel all that.. but..

1408
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:37,595
Is it the same Sirisha that Mr.
Uday wants to marry..

1409
01:16:37,737 --> 01:16:40,069
Prabhavati..
- Whatever! - My boy, Venky!

1410
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:43,208
I'll manage all those matters

1411
01:16:43,409 --> 01:16:45,639
But you shouldn't try
to meet that girl at all

1412
01:16:45,878 --> 01:16:46,936
I take your leave

1413
01:16:52,452 --> 01:16:55,819
You know that father
will be treated on Sunday

1414
01:16:55,922 --> 01:16:57,480
Still why did you have to go?
- Sorry, mom!

1415
01:16:57,857 --> 01:16:58,949
Get in.

1416
01:17:05,164 --> 01:17:07,098
The headlines in the news today.

1417
01:17:11,904 --> 01:17:14,134
News being presented by N. Bhanumurty

1418
01:17:15,475 --> 01:17:19,571
In bollywood, in a movie called 'Maine
pyaar kiya', Rakesh Roshan's son..

1419
01:17:19,746 --> 01:17:22,715
Hritik Roshan acted well and
stood up to his father's reputation

1420
01:17:22,949 --> 01:17:25,213
In America,
the son of George Bush senior..

1421
01:17:25,385 --> 01:17:27,148
George Bush, became the president

1422
01:17:27,387 --> 01:17:31,653
In Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam
Yadav's son Akhilesh became the CM

1423
01:17:33,926 --> 01:17:38,625
And in cricket, playing against England,
Yograj Singh's son..

1424
01:17:38,798 --> 01:17:41,289
..hit 6 sixes in a single over!

1425
01:17:42,368 --> 01:17:44,768
I who read news in Doordarshan..

1426
01:17:44,971 --> 01:17:47,804
..earned a great reputation and titles.

1427
01:17:49,175 --> 01:17:51,643
But my son fell in love with a girl..

1428
01:18:22,008 --> 01:18:23,134
Sorry, father!

1429
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:26,608
She wasn't there yesterday..
I am fine still

1430
01:18:27,613 --> 01:18:29,911
She wasn't there the day before either..
I am happy all the same

1431
01:18:31,617 --> 01:18:33,778
It means that I'll be happy
even if she wouldn't be there tomorrow

1432
01:18:35,822 --> 01:18:38,757
You never told me any time
that I should become this or that..

1433
01:18:40,393 --> 01:18:41,485
You were my childhood hero!

1434
01:18:42,895 --> 01:18:44,726
I used to feel great
when others praised you

1435
01:18:45,031 --> 01:18:46,259
I used to feel very happy!

1436
01:18:50,136 --> 01:18:51,626
I too wanted to become like you one day

1437
01:18:52,905 --> 01:18:54,930
I'll be.. I'll be like you

1438
01:18:56,075 --> 01:18:57,702
You shall feel proud
of me that day, father!

1439
01:19:07,787 --> 01:19:09,345
It seems that you changed
the plans on the spot

1440
01:19:09,822 --> 01:19:11,153
It seems you said you didn't like her

1441
01:19:11,257 --> 01:19:12,952
That's why I got a gift for you

1442
01:19:15,094 --> 01:19:17,085
So I shall go after Sirisha right away..

1443
01:19:17,897 --> 01:19:19,455
For me to assume your wit, smartness..

1444
01:19:19,665 --> 01:19:22,293
..pace, energy and intelligence..
this device will help

1445
01:19:22,969 --> 01:19:26,564
You'll keep coaching
me what I should say and do..

1446
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:28,201
..and I'll make the
girl fall in love with me

1447
01:19:29,008 --> 01:19:31,340
This is for you..
via bluetooth.. what do you say?

1448
01:19:32,745 --> 01:19:36,442
So.. if I coach you on the fly,
you'll snare her - Yes..

1449
01:19:36,783 --> 01:19:38,045
What was your rank in the entrance exam?

1450
01:19:38,484 --> 01:19:40,145
I got in via NRI quota..
Didn't like the plan?

1451
01:19:41,788 --> 01:19:44,780
Venky, know what they call
a person who promises but fails?

1452
01:19:44,957 --> 01:19:46,788
They may call him N Venkateswara Rao!

1453
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,018
But my problem is not that..

1454
01:19:50,029 --> 01:19:51,394
Here.. take this 3G phone..

1455
01:19:51,964 --> 01:19:54,592
From now on, you shall ensure
that I don't talk like a fool

1456
01:19:54,867 --> 01:19:56,164
The plan looks fine Mr. Uday!

1457
01:19:56,536 --> 01:19:59,164
But I can't keep advising
you on wireless an entire life

1458
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:00,330
You shall do that too if required

1459
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,499
I think I forgot
its charger in the car..

1460
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:06,475
I shall go and get it..
you pay the bill meanwhile

1461
01:20:09,382 --> 01:20:10,406
Okay?

1462
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:17,085
How much is it? - 310 rupees, sir.

1463
01:20:22,361 --> 01:20:23,692
How are you doing, Venky? - Ah?

1464
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,365
I'm fine.. how about you?

1465
01:20:30,203 --> 01:20:32,034
I.. I have to leave.

1466
01:20:32,238 --> 01:20:34,672
Are you angry that I left
Vizag without telling you?

1467
01:20:35,208 --> 01:20:36,266
Nothing of that sort..

1468
01:20:38,978 --> 01:20:40,309
Why don't we share
a cup of coffee together?

1469
01:20:40,746 --> 01:20:41,872
For old times sake..

1470
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:45,808
Come this way..

1471
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:54,490
I remembered those summer
times when I saw your photo

1472
01:20:55,328 --> 01:20:56,761
It was such a nice time

1473
01:20:57,196 --> 01:20:58,254
Nice feeling!

1474
01:20:59,932 --> 01:21:01,058
Yes, indeed..

1475
01:21:01,667 --> 01:21:02,929
We were young and foolish..

1476
01:21:04,871 --> 01:21:06,532
Did you go to Vizag again?

1477
01:21:11,410 --> 01:21:13,878
No.. did you go there?

1478
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:16,671
What do you think?

1479
01:21:19,051 --> 01:21:21,519
Didn't you ever remember
me before you saw me again?

1480
01:21:22,622 --> 01:21:24,749
You ran away even after you saw me

1481
01:21:26,993 --> 01:21:29,791
But you were the one who
disappeared in the first place

1482
01:21:31,097 --> 01:21:33,861
But now I appeared on my own wish

1483
01:21:34,934 --> 01:21:35,992
No..

1484
01:21:36,102 --> 01:21:37,694
You got this wish after you saw me

1485
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:41,398
Otherwise you would have
assumed another surname..

1486
01:21:41,741 --> 01:21:42,639
That's what you want..

1487
01:21:42,842 --> 01:21:45,310
I want to be Prabhavati
Venkateswara Rao!

1488
01:22:03,596 --> 01:22:05,723
I came to spend some
happy moments with you..

1489
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,326
In that case, you keep
talking and I'll return shortly!

1490
01:22:10,436 --> 01:22:11,960
Where are you going? - To the washroom!

1491
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:17,266
Sir, give me the charger..
I'll get it charged.

1492
01:22:17,977 --> 01:22:19,171
You make a move.

1493
01:22:24,283 --> 01:22:27,116
Venky, Sirisha is here.
I'll go and talk to her.. you go - Sir..

1494
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:28,910
Wait, let's implement our plan.

1495
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:30,818
You go the washroom
and coach me the sentences..

1496
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:32,316
Go in there, Venky - Sir..

1497
01:22:42,668 --> 01:22:44,568
Hello! - Hey!

1498
01:22:49,675 --> 01:22:51,870
Hey.. what are you doing here?

1499
01:22:51,978 --> 01:22:56,278
What are you doing here?
- Me.. - I came for some fresh air..

1500
01:22:56,682 --> 01:22:58,582
Came for some fresh air.. - Fresh air?!

1501
01:22:58,684 --> 01:23:00,015
What!!

1502
01:23:02,788 --> 01:23:04,813
You? - I didn't come for fresh air..

1503
01:23:05,257 --> 01:23:06,747
I came to meet a friend

1504
01:23:06,959 --> 01:23:08,187
I am inside! Ah!

1505
01:23:08,461 --> 01:23:10,588
Don't reveal the name!
- Don't reveal the name!

1506
01:23:11,497 --> 01:23:13,397
Why? Do you like the suspense?

1507
01:23:13,666 --> 01:23:15,190
Tell me something!

1508
01:23:15,768 --> 01:23:17,668
What shall I say? You say something..

1509
01:23:18,004 --> 01:23:19,266
Did you like my shoes?

1510
01:23:19,405 --> 01:23:21,464
What? - But are wearing slippers!

1511
01:23:21,574 --> 01:23:22,905
Did you like my shoes?

1512
01:23:23,809 --> 01:23:25,674
They are fine..
'What a strange person'!

1513
01:23:26,112 --> 01:23:28,273
Tell me the truth..
aren't they too bright and gawdy?

1514
01:23:28,414 --> 01:23:29,813
But they don't look like shoes at all?

1515
01:23:30,016 --> 01:23:33,042
They are slippers..
called flip-flops in America!

1516
01:23:33,519 --> 01:23:35,043
No! They are fine..

1517
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:37,016
So if any friend of
yours wears such shoes..

1518
01:23:37,256 --> 01:23:39,884
..and goes out with you for a movie
or shopping, you won't feel insulted?

1519
01:23:39,992 --> 01:23:41,186
I wouldn't.. what's wrong with them?

1520
01:23:41,494 --> 01:23:42,461
They look really nice..

1521
01:23:42,561 --> 01:23:45,496
Then I shall come in these shoes..
why don't you join me for dinner?

1522
01:23:45,598 --> 01:23:47,327
Where shall we go? To the Taj or...

1523
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:51,064
Not now, sir..
my friend is waiting outside..

1524
01:23:51,203 --> 01:23:53,671
I thought you will
get angry on seeing me..

1525
01:23:54,473 --> 01:23:55,940
Regarding the marriage proposal..

1526
01:23:56,675 --> 01:23:58,575
..I am not at ease with myself.

1527
01:23:59,979 --> 01:24:02,675
I want some more time
to take a decision..

1528
01:24:02,915 --> 01:24:04,109
You don't think about that..

1529
01:24:04,383 --> 01:24:05,782
We shall go for a dinner
once more meanwhile..

1530
01:24:07,086 --> 01:24:09,554
We may do so.. but just had my lunch!

1531
01:24:10,022 --> 01:24:11,216
A dinner once more?

1532
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:15,260
I don't want it - But I agreed
at once when you suggested..

1533
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:16,894
You should agree when I ask for it

1534
01:24:17,096 --> 01:24:18,188
That is the rule

1535
01:24:18,564 --> 01:24:20,930
I can't follow the rule..
will pay a fine if needed..

1536
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:22,361
That is true too

1537
01:24:23,002 --> 01:24:25,732
But I don't want it. Things
will get complicated unnecessarily

1538
01:24:25,838 --> 01:24:27,533
Trust me.. nothing extravagant!

1539
01:24:28,407 --> 01:24:29,999
Ok.. I too have something to tell you

1540
01:24:30,242 --> 01:24:32,005
By the way..
you were mentioning a friend earlier

1541
01:24:32,144 --> 01:24:33,907
By the way..
you were mentioning a friend earlier

1542
01:24:34,046 --> 01:24:35,536
Who is that friend?
- Who is that friend?

1543
01:24:35,815 --> 01:24:37,305
Is he handsome? - Is he handsome?

1544
01:24:37,516 --> 01:24:39,006
Do you like him very much?

1545
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:41,242
Your boyfriend?
- Nothing like that, sir.

1546
01:24:41,353 --> 01:24:42,877
We are just good friends, that's all

1547
01:24:43,689 --> 01:24:45,919
Nothing like that..
he belongs to a family I know..

1548
01:24:47,626 --> 01:24:49,890
Ok then.. Friday 7 pm at Taj Banjara..

1549
01:24:49,995 --> 01:24:52,429
Ok then.. Friday 7 pm at Taj Banjara..

1550
01:24:52,798 --> 01:24:55,460
You are forcing me into it..
let me finish this first!

1551
01:24:58,237 --> 01:24:59,602
Thanks Venky,
it all happened because of you

1552
01:24:59,738 --> 01:25:01,865
I shall see you in office tomorrow..
Leaving now, see you.

1553
01:25:10,749 --> 01:25:11,943
Sorry, I got delayed.

1554
01:25:12,351 --> 01:25:13,443
Were you bored? - No..

1555
01:25:13,786 --> 01:25:15,310
I was talking to a friend who dropped by

1556
01:25:16,155 --> 01:25:17,144
He is so funny!

1557
01:25:17,556 --> 01:25:20,320
It takes a minute to
guess what he is saying

1558
01:25:20,926 --> 01:25:23,019
How do you know him?
- Through a marriage..

1559
01:25:24,597 --> 01:25:26,724
I met him at a marriage..

1560
01:25:30,002 --> 01:25:32,129
But why did you want to
check proposals at a temple?

1561
01:25:33,305 --> 01:25:34,602
I am 25 now..

1562
01:25:35,975 --> 01:25:38,341
You know that my
feet are always grounded

1563
01:25:38,677 --> 01:25:40,008
I'm very practical!

1564
01:25:40,546 --> 01:25:42,537
Yeah! I know that quite well!

1565
01:25:45,184 --> 01:25:48,153
And you said your eyes
are always looking at the sky..

1566
01:25:48,387 --> 01:25:50,617
What happened to your dream
of becoming a news reader?

1567
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:53,587
Listen, I have to go..

1568
01:25:54,493 --> 01:25:56,620
When do we meet again? - Friday, 7 pm..

1569
01:25:58,631 --> 01:26:00,428
Friday, 7 pm..

1570
01:26:01,867 --> 01:26:03,858
I have some other thing to attend

1571
01:26:04,336 --> 01:26:05,963
Ok then.. go to attend that thing..

1572
01:26:13,979 --> 01:26:16,948
Prabha, shall we tell Gopal
Rao that you liked Uday proposal?

1573
01:26:17,149 --> 01:26:18,878
Or we shall seek any
other proposal if you wish

1574
01:26:19,084 --> 01:26:20,779
But you won't find
a better one than this

1575
01:26:21,654 --> 01:26:23,212
Don't look for any other proposal,
sis-in-law.

1576
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:27,518
Shall we fix the marriage dates then?
- I'll marry Venky and none else

1577
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,920
But how?

1578
01:26:29,728 --> 01:26:31,992
I'm going to meet Venky
today and ask clearly

1579
01:26:32,097 --> 01:26:34,088
What shall we say if
Uday's side calls up today?

1580
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,362
I'm going to meet Uday too today

1581
01:26:36,502 --> 01:26:37,992
I'll tell him clearly - No, Prabha!

1582
01:26:38,103 --> 01:26:40,970
There can be confusion but
not double clarity at the same time.

1583
01:26:42,575 --> 01:26:44,406
Give me a week more, brother

1584
01:26:45,177 --> 01:26:46,644
I don't know what you will do

1585
01:26:47,012 --> 01:26:50,413
If you don't decide within a week,
I shall do what I like

1586
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:30,550
Hello.. - It's me.. - It's me here too!

1587
01:27:30,789 --> 01:27:33,622
Venky, please.
I want to speak something with you

1588
01:27:35,361 --> 01:27:36,828
I don't mind even if you get angry

1589
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:40,291
Will you please meet me once? - Sure!

1590
01:27:40,599 --> 01:27:42,726
I have a holiday next week.
Shall we meet then?

1591
01:27:42,835 --> 01:27:44,462
Venky! I don't have that much time.

1592
01:27:45,437 --> 01:27:46,995
I have to meet you urgently.

1593
01:27:47,406 --> 01:27:48,600
We shall meet today.

1594
01:27:49,475 --> 01:27:51,443
I don't have any important engagement.

1595
01:27:51,677 --> 01:27:53,304
I will cancel it for you.

1596
01:27:53,412 --> 01:27:55,573
Shall we meet at 7 o'clock?
- Not needed.

1597
01:27:55,914 --> 01:27:57,108
You can look after your work.

1598
01:27:57,216 --> 01:27:58,513
Let us meet at 9 o'clock.

1599
01:27:59,184 --> 01:28:00,242
Bye, Prabha.

1600
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:03,814
Who is it? Prabhavati from Vizag?

1601
01:28:04,256 --> 01:28:05,587
Where did you meet her again?

1602
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:07,750
I went to marriage looks the other day.

1603
01:28:08,761 --> 01:28:10,319
Oh, marriage looks?!

1604
01:28:10,562 --> 01:28:12,291
Will you invite us
for the marriage at least?

1605
01:28:13,465 --> 01:28:15,695
I will take you too
if she invites me. Okay?

1606
01:28:16,302 --> 01:28:17,564
What do you mean?

1607
01:28:19,338 --> 01:28:21,806
Sir? - Venky!
Did you write a love letter before?

1608
01:28:21,907 --> 01:28:22,999
Why did you ask that, sir?

1609
01:28:23,108 --> 01:28:24,769
Nothing. I want you to write one for me.

1610
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:26,969
Oh, no! Why would I write
a love letter to you, sir?

1611
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,677
If necessary, you write it yourself.

1612
01:28:29,982 --> 01:28:31,074
I will sign it.

1613
01:28:31,183 --> 01:28:33,174
You should write the
letter and I will sign it.

1614
01:28:33,352 --> 01:28:35,183
I want to give it to
Sirisha during dinner tonight.

1615
01:28:35,287 --> 01:28:37,619
Is that so, sir? I cannot do that, sir.

1616
01:28:38,023 --> 01:28:39,718
You are the one who is love
then how can I write the letter?

1617
01:28:39,892 --> 01:28:42,884
I will love the girl and you love the
letter. I know it will come wonderfully.

1618
01:28:43,128 --> 01:28:45,494
Sir? - Don't say anything.
Just write it.

1619
01:28:45,931 --> 01:28:47,228
Show some teamwork.

1620
01:29:31,276 --> 01:29:34,905
"There is no doubt,
your beautiful smile.."

1621
01:29:35,013 --> 01:29:37,504
"..brought this excitement."

1622
01:29:38,684 --> 01:29:42,450
"There is no doubt, your shyness.."

1623
01:29:42,554 --> 01:29:45,250
"..is driving me towards you."

1624
01:29:46,258 --> 01:29:49,887
"There is no doubt, your sweet voice.."

1625
01:29:50,062 --> 01:29:53,088
"..fills my heart with happiness."

1626
01:29:53,332 --> 01:29:56,927
"My heart is floating high in the air."

1627
01:29:57,069 --> 01:30:00,561
"When I think about you, my dear."

1628
01:30:00,839 --> 01:30:04,468
"I want to walk with
you like a companion.."

1629
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:10,515
"..this is the request of
my heart expressed in this letter."

1630
01:30:10,616 --> 01:30:17,647
"There is no doubt, your beautiful
smile brought this excitement."

1631
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:21,819
"There is no doubt, your shyness.."

1632
01:30:21,927 --> 01:30:24,987
"..is driving me towards you."

1633
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:06,665
Hi, Venky! Do you think she would come?

1634
01:31:07,306 --> 01:31:08,432
What should I do if she doesn't come?

1635
01:31:08,574 --> 01:31:10,303
You can have the order parcelled
if she doesn't come, sir.

1636
01:31:10,876 --> 01:31:12,104
Not that.

1637
01:31:12,578 --> 01:31:14,603
Should I give her the letter as
soon as she comes or before she leaves?

1638
01:31:14,847 --> 01:31:17,315
This is not some movie ticket
to show as soon as we enter.

1639
01:31:17,816 --> 01:31:19,044
This is a letter.

1640
01:31:19,151 --> 01:31:21,016
You have to give it
romantically before she leaves.

1641
01:31:21,153 --> 01:31:22,484
Sir, what will you have?

1642
01:31:23,755 --> 01:31:24,585
Okay. Okay.

1643
01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:26,248
"Black clouds are forming.."

1644
01:31:26,358 --> 01:31:29,555
Venky! Venky! Here she comes. Yes.

1645
01:31:30,162 --> 01:31:31,322
Oh! Hi!

1646
01:31:32,197 --> 01:31:38,796
"Black clouds are forming.."

1647
01:31:39,505 --> 01:31:42,099
Why do you always keep
a bluetooth in your ear?

1648
01:31:43,175 --> 01:31:46,770
Actually.. - Like the
Chakra in Lord Vishnu's hands..

1649
01:31:47,045 --> 01:31:48,478
Like the Chakra in Lord Vishnu's hands..

1650
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:51,410
Like the Trident in Lord Shiva's hands..
- Like the Trident in Lord Shiva's hands

1651
01:31:51,683 --> 01:31:52,843
I keep bluetooth in my ears.

1652
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:56,719
You speak wonderfully.

1653
01:31:58,056 --> 01:31:59,387
You have a saint sense of humor.

1654
01:31:59,491 --> 01:32:00,651
Really? - Yes.

1655
01:32:04,496 --> 01:32:05,554
Thank you.

1656
01:32:06,732 --> 01:32:08,029
For a new friendship.

1657
01:32:09,268 --> 01:32:10,565
What is new in this?

1658
01:32:11,203 --> 01:32:13,398
This is fourth time we are meeting.

1659
01:32:13,939 --> 01:32:16,464
Correct!
But I have a confession to make.

1660
01:32:16,842 --> 01:32:19,276
Difference! This is not a church.

1661
01:32:20,112 --> 01:32:21,204
I am not a Father!

1662
01:32:21,313 --> 01:32:22,905
But you must hear my prayer.

1663
01:32:23,115 --> 01:32:24,878
I said some lies in the
beginning of our friendship.

1664
01:32:25,784 --> 01:32:27,547
Interesting. Go on.

1665
01:32:29,254 --> 01:32:31,552
Actually.. I am..

1666
01:32:32,190 --> 01:32:33,452
..an ordinary man.

1667
01:32:33,725 --> 01:32:36,285
I know that Md. Rafi is a singer.

1668
01:32:36,495 --> 01:32:37,792
But I don't know about his songs.

1669
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:41,859
I used to think painter Ravi Varma
is related to director Ram Gopal Varma.

1670
01:32:42,968 --> 01:32:44,697
I tell the PA to book the tickets
when it comes to travelling..

1671
01:32:44,937 --> 01:32:45,596
..but not so interested.

1672
01:32:45,871 --> 01:32:47,065
But I lied to you.

1673
01:32:47,172 --> 01:32:49,732
But I lied to you.

1674
01:32:50,108 --> 01:32:51,700
What for? - Because..

1675
01:32:54,112 --> 01:32:55,272
I like you.

1676
01:32:57,149 --> 01:32:58,207
Sir! Should I bring you something?

1677
01:32:58,450 --> 01:33:00,816
Mr. Uday! I don't know how to tell you..

1678
01:33:00,919 --> 01:33:02,716
Oh, no! Just idly!

1679
01:33:02,988 --> 01:33:04,546
Oh, no! Just idly.

1680
01:33:04,756 --> 01:33:05,882
Idly?!

1681
01:33:06,024 --> 01:33:09,050
Idly! I..d..l..y..

1682
01:33:09,361 --> 01:33:10,419
I do love you.

1683
01:33:10,762 --> 01:33:11,888
I do love you.

1684
01:33:12,664 --> 01:33:13,892
Oh!

1685
01:33:15,834 --> 01:33:19,099
Mr. Uday! How to say this..

1686
01:33:19,738 --> 01:33:22,969
I went to spend summer holidays
with my granny five years back.

1687
01:33:23,075 --> 01:33:24,838
Idly will be nice, sir.
That is our speciality.

1688
01:33:25,177 --> 01:33:26,542
Guntur? Uncle?

1689
01:33:26,645 --> 01:33:28,237
Guntur? Uncle?

1690
01:33:28,714 --> 01:33:29,772
Vizag!

1691
01:33:29,915 --> 01:33:30,643
Grandma!

1692
01:33:32,851 --> 01:33:34,944
Oh, I too want to tell you something.

1693
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,288
I have attended three
marriages after meeting you.

1694
01:33:37,522 --> 01:33:39,251
I thought about the same
thing in every marriage.

1695
01:33:39,658 --> 01:33:41,319
Is it how to marry me?

1696
01:33:43,028 --> 01:33:44,222
Hey!

1697
01:33:46,765 --> 01:33:47,925
Actually why..

1698
01:33:48,433 --> 01:33:51,493
When Sirisha is there,
how could this groom marry that bride?

1699
01:33:51,603 --> 01:33:53,036
That was my doubt.

1700
01:33:53,639 --> 01:33:54,697
Do you know why they did that?

1701
01:33:54,806 --> 01:33:56,239
Because they didn't see you.

1702
01:33:56,441 --> 01:33:57,874
But I saw Sirisha.

1703
01:33:59,177 --> 01:34:01,441
It's true.
From the moment I met you..

1704
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:04,275
..everything I could think..

1705
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:07,680
..is you and only you.

1706
01:34:09,187 --> 01:34:10,484
That is why..

1707
01:34:11,657 --> 01:34:14,353
..I am not able to see anyone else.
- I am not able to see anyone else.

1708
01:34:19,598 --> 01:34:21,623
Why are you looking at me like that?

1709
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,265
There is something on your face.

1710
01:34:23,902 --> 01:34:25,802
Is it gone? - No!

1711
01:34:26,471 --> 01:34:28,268
Now? - No.

1712
01:34:30,175 --> 01:34:31,836
There is beauty on your face.

1713
01:34:33,912 --> 01:34:35,573
Sir! Do you want ginger
chutney or coconut chutney?

1714
01:34:35,847 --> 01:34:38,145
Oh, beauty cannot
go even if you wipe it.

1715
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:39,840
Beauty cannot go even if you wipe it.

1716
01:34:43,622 --> 01:34:44,884
Sir! Do you want ginger
chutney or coconut chutney?

1717
01:34:45,257 --> 01:34:46,349
What is beauty?

1718
01:34:47,626 --> 01:34:50,094
Hey! - Sir! Do you want
ginger chutney or coconut chutney?

1719
01:34:50,295 --> 01:34:51,125
Beauty means..

1720
01:34:51,329 --> 01:34:53,263
Give it. - Do you want ginger
chutney or coconut chutney?

1721
01:34:56,101 --> 01:34:56,760
Beauty means..

1722
01:34:56,902 --> 01:34:58,767
Hey, give it back. - Sir! Do you
want ginger chutney or coconut chutney?

1723
01:34:59,004 --> 01:35:00,437
Beauty means..

1724
01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:04,770
Beautiful eyes, nose, lips..

1725
01:35:04,976 --> 01:35:07,638
So, beauty means what you see outside.

1726
01:35:08,113 --> 01:35:09,512
Beauty means what you see outside?

1727
01:35:10,315 --> 01:35:11,748
Anybody? Anybody?

1728
01:35:11,983 --> 01:35:13,177
Beauty means what you see outside?

1729
01:35:14,953 --> 01:35:16,386
No, not only what appears..

1730
01:35:17,155 --> 01:35:19,646
..but I believe kidneys,
liver and lungs will also be beautiful.

1731
01:35:24,696 --> 01:35:25,788
I don't understand.

1732
01:35:28,967 --> 01:35:30,434
Sir, ginger chutney or.. - Idiot!

1733
01:35:32,204 --> 01:35:33,501
I am sorry, Uday.

1734
01:35:33,605 --> 01:35:35,766
I don't know how to tell you this.

1735
01:35:36,108 --> 01:35:38,042
In Vizag.. - Ginger chutney
or coconut chutney.. - You..

1736
01:35:38,143 --> 01:35:39,735
I will fall at your feet,
don't tell me anything.

1737
01:35:40,278 --> 01:35:41,836
I will fall at your feet,
don't tell me anything.

1738
01:35:42,681 --> 01:35:44,876
No, Uday! I cannot let you wait..

1739
01:35:45,016 --> 01:35:46,347
..I feel very bad.

1740
01:35:46,618 --> 01:35:47,915
I hate myself for this.

1741
01:35:48,987 --> 01:35:51,717
I am not able to look
straight into your eyes.

1742
01:35:51,957 --> 01:35:53,049
Your eyes are..

1743
01:35:54,392 --> 01:35:55,882
..very beautiful.

1744
01:35:57,395 --> 01:35:58,760
Just like fish.

1745
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:03,634
Your eyes are also nice. - My eyes?

1746
01:36:04,302 --> 01:36:05,963
I don't think so.

1747
01:36:06,338 --> 01:36:08,135
But when I look at your eyes..

1748
01:36:08,306 --> 01:36:09,796
But when I look at your eyes..

1749
01:36:10,008 --> 01:36:12,033
Sir! Do you want coconut
chutney or ginger chutney?

1750
01:36:12,577 --> 01:36:13,566
I'll eat one with coconut chutney..

1751
01:36:13,712 --> 01:36:15,612
..and the other with ginger chutney.
Would you mind?

1752
01:36:15,881 --> 01:36:16,905
I'll eat one with coconut chutney..

1753
01:36:17,015 --> 01:36:18,482
..and the other with ginger chutney.
Would you mind?

1754
01:36:18,683 --> 01:36:19,513
What?!

1755
01:36:22,954 --> 01:36:24,751
Sorry! You fool!

1756
01:36:25,524 --> 01:36:26,456
Oh, no!

1757
01:36:28,059 --> 01:36:29,651
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1758
01:36:29,795 --> 01:36:30,853
No! No! It's okay.

1759
01:36:30,962 --> 01:36:32,691
I have to meet a friend at 9 o'clock.

1760
01:36:32,898 --> 01:36:33,922
Very important.

1761
01:36:34,299 --> 01:36:35,493
Then let us meet again tomorrow.

1762
01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:38,636
Not possible.

1763
01:36:38,937 --> 01:36:41,701
My family members are going out.
I must look after the aquarium. Bye!

1764
01:36:43,175 --> 01:36:45,234
Venkateswara Rao asked
me to come at 7.30pm.

1765
01:36:45,443 --> 01:36:48,241
This girl is with him.
Something is wrong.

1766
01:36:50,515 --> 01:36:51,675
You forgot about letter, sir.

1767
01:36:53,618 --> 01:36:55,347
Siri! Siri!

1768
01:36:55,587 --> 01:36:56,815
Siri! Siri! Siri!

1769
01:36:59,391 --> 01:37:01,757
All that I couldn't tell you
directly are written..

1770
01:37:02,394 --> 01:37:03,486
I mean wrote them and signed.

1771
01:37:22,814 --> 01:37:25,783
"I am under the moonlight,
but it is very warm.."

1772
01:37:26,484 --> 01:37:29,112
"..when I think about you."

1773
01:37:30,255 --> 01:37:33,691
"No matter where I am.."

1774
01:37:33,959 --> 01:37:36,723
"..I remember only you."

1775
01:37:37,062 --> 01:37:40,759
"Your eyes entered into my dream.."

1776
01:37:40,899 --> 01:37:43,925
"..and showed me a new world."

1777
01:37:44,035 --> 01:37:47,835
"After knowing the truth
that sleep has deserted me.."

1778
01:37:47,939 --> 01:37:51,568
"..my heart is seeking your shelter."

1779
01:37:51,710 --> 01:37:53,769
"Like a companion.."

1780
01:37:53,879 --> 01:37:55,403
"..walk with me.."

1781
01:37:55,513 --> 01:38:01,315
"..this is a request
I made through this letter."

1782
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:05,383
"I am under the moonlight,
but it is very warm.."

1783
01:38:06,024 --> 01:38:08,925
"..when I think about you."

1784
01:38:40,959 --> 01:38:42,517
Come, Prabha! - Venky!

1785
01:38:43,728 --> 01:38:45,355
Don't play games with me. Please.

1786
01:38:46,498 --> 01:38:49,433
If you are angry with me,
let us finish it later.

1787
01:38:49,634 --> 01:38:50,999
Anger?

1788
01:38:51,269 --> 01:38:53,260
How can I be angry with you
when I don't even think about you?

1789
01:38:56,541 --> 01:38:58,236
I like you a lot.

1790
01:39:00,011 --> 01:39:01,205
Me too.

1791
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:03,279
I too like me a lot.

1792
01:39:05,784 --> 01:39:07,718
I know that you like me too.

1793
01:39:07,819 --> 01:39:08,877
Is that why..

1794
01:39:09,421 --> 01:39:12,083
..you are looking for other matches?
- Venky! Please..

1795
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:16,419
I always think about
those summer holidays.

1796
01:39:17,696 --> 01:39:20,688
Most beautiful two months of my life.

1797
01:39:23,969 --> 01:39:25,163
Venky!

1798
01:39:27,939 --> 01:39:31,306
If you are with me,
rest of my life will also be like that.

1799
01:39:31,943 --> 01:39:33,934
I really believe it.
- It has been many days.

1800
01:39:35,413 --> 01:39:38,177
Had I committed some crime then,
I would have been released by now.

1801
01:39:39,451 --> 01:39:41,248
But I am unable to get rid of you.

1802
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,711
I don't have time to argue with you.

1803
01:39:43,989 --> 01:39:45,183
I will ask you straight.

1804
01:39:45,623 --> 01:39:46,783
Will you marry me?

1805
01:39:49,194 --> 01:39:50,252
Please!

1806
01:39:51,830 --> 01:39:52,888
Sorry, Prabha!

1807
01:39:59,804 --> 01:40:00,964
Did you see this letter?

1808
01:40:01,606 --> 01:40:02,937
How beautifully he wrote it?

1809
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:05,835
I read it three times while coming here.

1810
01:40:06,344 --> 01:40:07,868
Why? Do you have to return it tomorrow?

1811
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,672
Shut up!

1812
01:40:12,751 --> 01:40:14,719
There are people who love me a lot.

1813
01:40:15,587 --> 01:40:17,282
But I was longing for you.

1814
01:40:18,323 --> 01:40:19,813
Go and marry him then. Go!

1815
01:40:32,771 --> 01:40:38,903
"Did you hear the voice
of the birds chirping?"

1816
01:40:39,477 --> 01:40:43,174
"The shower that clouds
bring to the earth.."

1817
01:40:43,281 --> 01:40:46,273
"..is coming out of my eyes."

1818
01:40:46,851 --> 01:40:53,950
"No matter what happens or what I do,
can I sit quiet?"

1819
01:40:54,059 --> 01:40:55,924
"I am not able to move ahead."

1820
01:40:56,061 --> 01:41:01,328
"My heart is being crushed
between my love and your hatred."

1821
01:41:01,566 --> 01:41:03,557
"For everything that has happened.."

1822
01:41:03,668 --> 01:41:11,200
"..my heart is sending
this silent letter of apology."

1823
01:41:31,129 --> 01:41:36,965
I have won.

1824
01:41:54,252 --> 01:41:56,743
Hello! - Prabha!
Don't forget to give food to fishes.

1825
01:41:57,255 --> 01:42:00,418
Okay. - Milkman will come.
I kept the vessel outside.

1826
01:42:00,725 --> 01:42:02,090
Okay.

1827
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:04,794
Think about Uday too.

1828
01:42:05,163 --> 01:42:06,721
Sis-in-law!

1829
01:42:19,377 --> 01:42:20,935
One minute!

1830
01:42:24,215 --> 01:42:25,648
Hello, angel!

1831
01:42:27,085 --> 01:42:28,347
Why are you here?

1832
01:42:30,288 --> 01:42:32,552
You said that there wouldn't
be anyone at home today.

1833
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:34,385
So I came here.

1834
01:42:35,093 --> 01:42:37,755
I am in a bad mood now.
- Boss! Finish it quickly.

1835
01:42:38,062 --> 01:42:39,962
There is no battery.
- I will not stay for too long.

1836
01:42:40,098 --> 01:42:41,326
Battery is about to finish.

1837
01:42:43,835 --> 01:42:45,234
You know what..

1838
01:42:47,338 --> 01:42:48,498
I am sorry.

1839
01:42:48,806 --> 01:42:52,503
Thank you for being so patient.

1840
01:42:53,211 --> 01:42:54,405
Friends?

1841
01:42:55,246 --> 01:42:57,111
Come inside. - Thank you.

1842
01:43:02,654 --> 01:43:04,952
I have read your letter.
- Really? - Yes.

1843
01:43:05,089 --> 01:43:06,579
Did you like it?
- Yes. - I didn't read it yet.

1844
01:43:06,724 --> 01:43:09,693
What do you mean?
- I wrote it but didn't read it.

1845
01:43:09,961 --> 01:43:11,223
Oh!

1846
01:43:12,030 --> 01:43:14,123
Sorry! I didn't offer you coffee.

1847
01:43:14,365 --> 01:43:15,491
Like to have some chips and tea?

1848
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,567
Okay.

1849
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:21,330
Hello?

1850
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:24,199
Hello? Hello? - Venky!

1851
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:27,908
Hello! - Boss!
Where are you? Signal is not reaching.

1852
01:43:28,046 --> 01:43:29,343
Venky!

1853
01:43:29,948 --> 01:43:31,210
Venky?

1854
01:43:31,316 --> 01:43:32,783
Venky!

1855
01:43:33,618 --> 01:43:36,280
Hello? Hello? Venky?

1856
01:43:36,754 --> 01:43:39,416
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1857
01:43:39,824 --> 01:43:41,121
Hello!

1858
01:43:41,859 --> 01:43:43,451
Venky! Hello!

1859
01:43:45,630 --> 01:43:48,565
I thought of proposing her tonight.
But there is no signal in the balcony.

1860
01:43:48,666 --> 01:43:50,725
And there is no charging in your phone.
What should I do, Venky?

1861
01:43:50,969 --> 01:43:53,028
Sir! I have another bad news for you.

1862
01:43:53,404 --> 01:43:55,998
Talk time is also less in my phone.

1863
01:43:56,574 --> 01:43:57,871
Don't you have any balance?

1864
01:43:58,243 --> 01:43:59,835
You just cut the phone. I will call you.

1865
01:44:00,345 --> 01:44:02,779
No, Sirisha is here. Keep talking.

1866
01:44:09,153 --> 01:44:10,381
You are strange.

1867
01:44:10,622 --> 01:44:12,886
Why don't you come
here and say something?

1868
01:44:13,124 --> 01:44:15,217
How long can I talk
when talk time is less?

1869
01:44:15,994 --> 01:44:17,894
Come and sit here.

1870
01:44:20,131 --> 01:44:22,326
I always like to sit here.

1871
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,358
These plants..

1872
01:44:25,169 --> 01:44:26,568
..this cold breeze..

1873
01:44:27,071 --> 01:44:29,596
..full moon and it's silvery light..

1874
01:44:30,608 --> 01:44:33,668
..what else do we need? - It would have
been nice if we had cell phone signal.

1875
01:44:34,012 --> 01:44:35,536
What happened to you?

1876
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:37,277
To tell you the truth..

1877
01:44:37,515 --> 01:44:40,006
..the way you revealed
your feelings to me..

1878
01:44:40,118 --> 01:44:41,346
..I liked it a lot.

1879
01:44:41,719 --> 01:44:44,882
Thank God! Didn't you like me?

1880
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:46,687
I didn't say that.

1881
01:44:47,025 --> 01:44:49,721
I couldn't react because
of the situation I was in.

1882
01:44:50,561 --> 01:44:52,495
What did you like in me?

1883
01:44:52,864 --> 01:44:54,161
Should I tell you now? - Yes.

1884
01:44:54,432 --> 01:44:56,491
Let us speak about it at some
other time under some cell tower.

1885
01:44:56,768 --> 01:44:58,292
But everything is written
in the letter. Nuisance!

1886
01:45:00,872 --> 01:45:04,501
The thing I like the most
in you is your way of talking.

1887
01:45:04,776 --> 01:45:07,006
Oh! - Very funny.

1888
01:45:08,212 --> 01:45:10,077
Please! Not in the letter..

1889
01:45:10,481 --> 01:45:11,743
..I want to hear you saying it.

1890
01:45:12,183 --> 01:45:13,912
There is no battery, balance and signal.

1891
01:45:14,118 --> 01:45:15,915
Forget about talking and let me do this.

1892
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:22,956
Please..

1893
01:45:31,502 --> 01:45:33,629
Leave me. - Just a minute.

1894
01:45:34,339 --> 01:45:35,533
Hey, what are you doing?

1895
01:45:36,341 --> 01:45:37,273
Hey!

1896
01:45:39,344 --> 01:45:40,368
What are you doing?

1897
01:45:40,611 --> 01:45:41,475
I love you, Siri.

1898
01:45:41,612 --> 01:45:43,239
I wanted to put this ring
and make you agree to our marriage.

1899
01:45:43,381 --> 01:45:44,439
But I did something else in tension.

1900
01:45:44,982 --> 01:45:46,916
Sorry! Please! I like you a lot.

1901
01:45:47,018 --> 01:45:48,110
Please forgive me and try to understand.

1902
01:45:48,219 --> 01:45:49,277
Or understand and then forgive me.

1903
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:50,978
No matter what the sequence,
do those two things.

1904
01:45:51,155 --> 01:45:53,350
Please! - Get out of my house.

1905
01:45:53,991 --> 01:45:55,458
Venky! This is terrible!

1906
01:45:55,593 --> 01:45:57,151
Everything is destroyed.

1907
01:45:57,295 --> 01:45:58,387
Lower your voice, sir.

1908
01:45:58,496 --> 01:46:00,964
What happened? - I thought
of putting the ring on her but..

1909
01:46:01,265 --> 01:46:03,165
O my God!
- Siri! - Sir! - Siri! - Wait, sir.

1910
01:46:03,534 --> 01:46:04,762
She will ask why I behaved like that.

1911
01:46:04,902 --> 01:46:06,096
Please, Venky! Please help me.

1912
01:46:06,204 --> 01:46:07,569
Sir! Light is dim here.

1913
01:46:07,772 --> 01:46:09,205
She cannot see who is speaking.

1914
01:46:09,307 --> 01:46:10,672
I will handle it. Leave it to me.

1915
01:46:10,775 --> 01:46:12,072
Leave it to me. Sir! Sir! Please!

1916
01:46:13,177 --> 01:46:14,701
Call out for her. - Siri!

1917
01:46:15,046 --> 01:46:16,536
Loudly! - Siri!

1918
01:46:19,917 --> 01:46:20,975
She is out. What should I do?

1919
01:46:21,386 --> 01:46:23,286
Say sorry. - I am sorry, Venky!

1920
01:46:23,788 --> 01:46:24,618
Not to me.

1921
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:26,218
I am sorry, Siri.

1922
01:46:26,357 --> 01:46:27,722
Why did you do that?

1923
01:46:29,894 --> 01:46:31,418
Because I am a fool.

1924
01:46:31,529 --> 01:46:32,723
Because he is a fool.

1925
01:46:33,131 --> 01:46:36,396
Who is he? - I mean.. me..

1926
01:46:36,701 --> 01:46:38,259
Do something, Venky! Please! - Ah?!

1927
01:46:38,669 --> 01:46:40,102
Siri! - Siri!

1928
01:46:40,671 --> 01:46:42,036
Why did you change your voice?

1929
01:46:42,673 --> 01:46:45,267
I change my voice when I sing.

1930
01:46:45,476 --> 01:46:46,875
You asked me why I like you.

1931
01:46:47,912 --> 01:46:49,038
Now I will tell you. Listen!

1932
01:47:10,735 --> 01:47:16,901
"I cannot say that I didn't
see more beautiful girls than you."

1933
01:47:19,644 --> 01:47:22,545
"But no matter how many beauties.."

1934
01:47:22,647 --> 01:47:25,878
"..I see my heart didn't have
this feeling before."

1935
01:47:28,519 --> 01:47:30,111
"When I thought for reason.."

1936
01:47:30,221 --> 01:47:34,385
"..I don't know why this happened
and is very confusing."

1937
01:47:34,525 --> 01:47:40,657
"I cannot say that I didn't
see more beautiful girls than you."

1938
01:47:43,401 --> 01:47:46,268
"But no matter how
many beauties I see.."

1939
01:47:46,404 --> 01:47:49,601
"..my heart didn't
have this feeling before."

1940
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:15,999
"No matter if you get angry.."

1941
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:18,864
"..or looked at me in anger.."

1942
01:48:19,003 --> 01:48:21,904
"..I felt everything was wonderful."

1943
01:48:22,039 --> 01:48:24,064
"Yes, it is."

1944
01:48:25,109 --> 01:48:28,943
"This is some kind of madness."

1945
01:48:29,046 --> 01:48:31,537
"I agree if anyone says that."

1946
01:48:31,649 --> 01:48:39,681
"But even then, I cannot stop
my heart from loving you even more."

1947
01:49:15,259 --> 01:49:18,251
"If everyone dreams about movie stars.."

1948
01:49:18,396 --> 01:49:21,229
"..and want to marry only them.."

1949
01:49:21,332 --> 01:49:26,395
"..I don't think there would
be so many happy couples in this world."

1950
01:49:27,004 --> 01:49:29,165
"If one looks you with my eyes,
they will find.."

1951
01:49:29,307 --> 01:49:33,038
"..that you are the only
beauty in this world."

1952
01:49:33,177 --> 01:49:35,873
"Even if I say so,
if everyone wants to see.."

1953
01:49:36,013 --> 01:49:41,110
"..you with my eyes,
I cannot allow that."

1954
01:49:53,831 --> 01:50:00,031
"I cannot say that I didn't
see more beautiful girls than you."

1955
01:50:02,807 --> 01:50:05,708
"But no matter how
many beauties I see.."

1956
01:50:05,810 --> 01:50:09,109
"..my heart didn't
have this feeling before."

1957
01:50:11,549 --> 01:50:14,575
"When I thought for reason,
I don't know.."

1958
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:17,779
"..why this happened
and is very confusing."

1959
01:50:49,053 --> 01:50:50,918
Why didn't you tell this a while ago?

1960
01:50:54,291 --> 01:50:55,588
Tell me why I didn't.

1961
01:50:57,128 --> 01:50:59,062
When you are in front of me..

1962
01:50:59,330 --> 01:51:01,025
..not only with you..

1963
01:51:01,232 --> 01:51:03,496
..it is very difficult
even to speak to myself.

1964
01:51:03,701 --> 01:51:06,261
Very difficult, Siri.
Hey, make it simple.

1965
01:51:07,071 --> 01:51:09,699
I am sorry for throwing you out.

1966
01:51:10,174 --> 01:51:12,199
Will you come upstairs once? Please!

1967
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:14,341
If you say that you will marry me..

1968
01:51:14,512 --> 01:51:16,309
If you say that you
will marry me. - Huh?

1969
01:51:16,681 --> 01:51:19,309
Venky! Just now a war is over.
Why do you start another one?

1970
01:51:19,583 --> 01:51:21,073
Will you..

1971
01:51:22,219 --> 01:51:23,914
..marry me?

1972
01:51:27,191 --> 01:51:28,385
I love you.

1973
01:51:28,492 --> 01:51:29,550
I love you.

1974
01:51:30,528 --> 01:51:31,722
Let us get married happily.

1975
01:51:31,929 --> 01:51:32,953
Let us get married happily.

1976
01:51:33,197 --> 01:51:35,791
Stop it. Just come here.
We can think later.

1977
01:51:37,535 --> 01:51:40,003
Wonderful! It seems she will
agree if I ask again. Shall I?

1978
01:51:40,938 --> 01:51:43,600
I am coming.
- She is almost agreed. Yes!

1979
01:51:44,875 --> 01:51:47,309
Thank you, Venky! Thank you so much!

1980
01:51:47,745 --> 01:51:49,144
Yes! Yes!

1981
01:51:52,249 --> 01:51:53,477
Shit!

1982
01:52:39,330 --> 01:52:41,059
Where did you go?

1983
01:52:42,767 --> 01:52:44,064
I know everything.

1984
01:52:44,769 --> 01:52:48,500
Why are you cheating
yourself and also Prabhavati?

1985
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:51,574
And also cheating Mr.
Uday.. - Not so many cheatings, mom.

1986
01:52:52,243 --> 01:52:53,767
I really don't like Prabhavati.

1987
01:52:57,848 --> 01:53:01,249
Hey, you don't have any
reason to like her. Is that true?

1988
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:04,478
Yes, mom.

1989
01:53:08,125 --> 01:53:09,649
Then what is this, my son?

1990
01:53:12,930 --> 01:53:16,229
If people think about
marrying to movie stars..

1991
01:53:16,333 --> 01:53:17,630
You read the name wrong, mom.

1992
01:53:17,968 --> 01:53:20,266
It's Kareena. - Than what?

1993
01:53:20,471 --> 01:53:22,962
Mom! I am very close
to fulfilling father's dream.

1994
01:53:23,874 --> 01:53:25,466
Don't say anything at this time.

1995
01:53:25,876 --> 01:53:27,707
You innocent fool!

1996
01:53:28,045 --> 01:53:31,879
If he make you news reader
in his channel after this..

1997
01:53:32,116 --> 01:53:33,743
Prabhavati will come and ask Mr. Uday..

1998
01:53:34,018 --> 01:53:35,815
..why is Venky, who came to see her..

1999
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:39,720
..working in his office,
what will he say then?

2000
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:45,052
Do you think he is using me, mom?

2001
01:53:45,763 --> 01:53:47,663
He is just playing with you.

2002
01:53:53,771 --> 01:54:00,040
Listen! You can read news
in some other channel if not in this.

2003
01:54:00,311 --> 01:54:03,803
But can you marry some
other girl than Prabhavati?

2004
01:54:04,381 --> 01:54:06,576
You make friendship with many girls..

2005
01:54:06,784 --> 01:54:10,515
..but you never spoke about
them like you speak about Prabhavati.

2006
01:54:12,056 --> 01:54:14,991
Listen to me and do something quickly.

2007
01:54:47,758 --> 01:54:50,056
Hey, congratulations! - What for?

2008
01:54:50,461 --> 01:54:53,430
First bulletin of the evening
news is today. Go and get ready.

2009
01:54:54,398 --> 01:54:56,798
I heard that boss's marriage is fixed.

2010
01:55:01,338 --> 01:55:04,330
Oh, no! Venky! Resign this job..

2011
01:55:04,441 --> 01:55:06,102
..and become a marriage broker.

2012
01:55:06,644 --> 01:55:08,509
Aren't you ashamed to do such things?

2013
01:55:13,617 --> 01:55:15,517
Hey, Venky! Come on in!

2014
01:55:18,489 --> 01:55:20,980
You know? I am the happiest
man under the sun today.

2015
01:55:21,725 --> 01:55:24,250
Why did you come here now? I have to
go out. I have an important engagement.

2016
01:55:24,495 --> 01:55:25,359
Engagement?

2017
01:55:25,763 --> 01:55:27,958
Small shopping with Sirisha,
engagement..

2018
01:55:28,065 --> 01:55:30,727
My engagement.
Tomorrow is my engagement with Sirisha.

2019
01:55:34,672 --> 01:55:37,573
I have to tell you something, sir.
- Are you resigning?

2020
01:55:37,808 --> 01:55:38,934
Yes, sir.

2021
01:55:51,322 --> 01:55:54,052
Vamanrao is coming
to tell you the truth.

2022
01:55:55,059 --> 01:55:56,924
To tell the truth..

2023
01:55:57,227 --> 01:55:58,717
Vamanrao is sitting in front of you.

2024
01:56:00,097 --> 01:56:01,564
Sorry, Mr. Vamanrao.

2025
01:56:01,699 --> 01:56:03,462
Boss will give you an opportunity.

2026
01:56:03,701 --> 01:56:05,760
Just wait for a while.
- Innocent Kalyani!

2027
01:56:07,338 --> 01:56:08,896
I am a practical man.

2028
01:56:11,875 --> 01:56:13,570
You forgot your pants.

2029
01:56:14,311 --> 01:56:16,575
We should spend money for
the clothes that appear on screen.

2030
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:18,645
There is no need to buy something
when do not appear on screen.

2031
01:56:18,749 --> 01:56:19,943
It is a waste.

2032
01:56:22,186 --> 01:56:24,950
Vamanrao is coming to
you to tell you the truth.

2033
01:56:32,096 --> 01:56:34,587
So the Sirisha whom you
loved is my Prabhavati, sir.

2034
01:56:35,666 --> 01:56:37,793
Venky! You can get any
girl because of your talent.

2035
01:56:38,135 --> 01:56:40,126
I doubt that you have many girlfriends.

2036
01:56:41,205 --> 01:56:44,174
If your girlfriends form a human
chain on hearing your marriage news..

2037
01:56:44,308 --> 01:56:45,502
..it will be as long
as Mahatma Gandhi road.

2038
01:56:45,776 --> 01:56:47,266
Listen. Leave Sirisha to me.

2039
01:56:47,378 --> 01:56:49,710
No, sir! The only girl
whom I loved is Prabhavati.

2040
01:56:49,913 --> 01:56:51,437
Venky! This is my order.

2041
01:56:51,982 --> 01:56:53,950
If you don't leave Sirisha to me,
I will dismiss you.

2042
01:56:54,585 --> 01:56:56,917
You don't have to since I am resigning.

2043
01:56:59,957 --> 01:57:01,322
Do you remember, three years back..

2044
01:57:01,425 --> 01:57:02,619
..I appointed you here
because of your anchoring..

2045
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:04,387
..in college anniversary function.

2046
01:57:04,495 --> 01:57:06,827
I gave you an opportunity to
fulfill your dream. Ungrateful guy!

2047
01:57:07,264 --> 01:57:08,993
Do you know what loyalty is?

2048
01:57:10,334 --> 01:57:12,598
I spoke nicely just because
you helped me. Or else I hate you.

2049
01:57:12,836 --> 01:57:15,964
Chit-chatting with ladies in the office,
disrespect for seniors..

2050
01:57:16,273 --> 01:57:17,865
..but come on time for the salary.

2051
01:57:19,343 --> 01:57:21,174
You say that you are poor
at expressing your feelings.

2052
01:57:21,278 --> 01:57:23,075
But you expressed your
hatred on me very well, sir.

2053
01:57:24,281 --> 01:57:25,339
It is because I hate you a lot.

2054
01:57:25,482 --> 01:57:27,006
My hatred made me speak like that.

2055
01:57:27,151 --> 01:57:30,086
If you really love Prabhavati, your
love would have made you express it.

2056
01:57:30,387 --> 01:57:31,979
But you cannot express your love.

2057
01:57:32,189 --> 01:57:33,747
That is because you didn't love.

2058
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:37,025
But I can. I will go and express
my love to Prabhavati immediately.

2059
01:57:37,628 --> 01:57:39,220
I don't want this
evening news reader post.

2060
01:57:39,329 --> 01:57:41,354
And I don't want the salary
which comes in the middle of the month.

2061
01:57:43,133 --> 01:57:45,693
Please leave me, sir.
I will take care of my life.

2062
01:57:47,638 --> 01:57:50,630
Sir! Four years back
Prabhavati liked me.

2063
01:57:51,208 --> 01:57:52,266
What about four years after?

2064
01:57:52,376 --> 01:57:55,368
Even after four years,
she liked me who reflected in your talk.

2065
01:57:55,779 --> 01:57:59,215
How sad? But Sirisha is
going to marry me and only me.

2066
01:58:00,384 --> 01:58:01,544
But I won't let her.

2067
01:58:01,685 --> 01:58:03,380
I will go and tell
the truth to Prabhavati.

2068
01:58:04,855 --> 01:58:06,152
Leave me! Leave me, sir.

2069
01:58:07,958 --> 01:58:09,118
I said Leave me.

2070
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:10,424
Hey! Hey!

2071
01:58:11,829 --> 01:58:12,989
How dare you hit me?

2072
01:58:14,331 --> 01:58:15,662
You! You! - Hey! Hey!

2073
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:20,427
Sir! Leave me, sir! Sir!

2074
01:58:20,737 --> 01:58:21,897
Sir!

2075
01:58:23,607 --> 01:58:26,838
Leave me! Please, sir! Leave me.

2076
01:58:26,944 --> 01:58:27,706
Sir!

2077
01:58:33,383 --> 01:58:35,476
Sir! Leave me, sir! - Now, this.

2078
01:58:38,689 --> 01:58:41,920
Sir! You can do whatever
you want but Prabhavati is mine.

2079
01:58:42,526 --> 01:58:43,390
Is Prabhavati yours?

2080
01:58:48,499 --> 01:58:52,333
How dare you turn against me?

2081
01:58:52,603 --> 01:58:54,537
You will stay like this till
my engagement with Sirisha is over.

2082
01:58:54,805 --> 01:58:56,773
I will think what to do
with you till marriage later.

2083
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:13,312
Sir! - Yes? - Our first
news bulletin starts in an hour.

2084
01:59:13,423 --> 01:59:14,617
We can take care of
everything once Venky is here.

2085
01:59:15,292 --> 01:59:16,452
It is Vamanrao and not Venky.

2086
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:19,351
Why is that, sir? - Venky has resigned.

2087
01:59:19,563 --> 01:59:21,087
He didn't even inform
the program director.

2088
01:59:21,365 --> 01:59:23,390
I told Vamanrao to get ready.
You make everything ready.

2089
01:59:37,948 --> 01:59:38,937
Venky!

2090
01:59:41,885 --> 01:59:43,182
Venky! Are you here?

2091
01:59:45,088 --> 01:59:46,282
I still doubt it.

2092
01:59:46,924 --> 01:59:49,222
If you are inside,
knock with your left foot.

2093
01:59:52,829 --> 01:59:54,023
Right foot at least.

2094
01:59:55,699 --> 01:59:56,791
Please!

2095
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:02,062
I saw him going inside.

2096
02:00:04,841 --> 02:00:05,899
What is it?

2097
02:00:06,009 --> 02:00:08,068
You forgot your bluetooth?

2098
02:00:08,178 --> 02:00:10,043
I understood the way,
so I wanted to manage myself.

2099
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:12,243
Shoes! Shall we buy some shoes?

2100
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:18,885
How many times should I tell
you not to pull your shirt like that?

2101
02:00:19,756 --> 02:00:21,223
I should have some signature moment.

2102
02:00:24,761 --> 02:00:27,924
Today you are not saying anything.

2103
02:00:28,899 --> 02:00:29,991
Is there some problem?

2104
02:00:30,234 --> 02:00:31,895
What can anyone say
anything after being tied?

2105
02:00:32,102 --> 02:00:33,296
I mean my mouth.

2106
02:00:39,076 --> 02:00:40,839
Today is the first bulletin
of our news program..

2107
02:00:41,078 --> 02:00:43,342
Still I came to meet you..
I like you that much..

2108
02:00:43,513 --> 02:00:44,445
Is it true? - Yes..

2109
02:00:49,219 --> 02:00:50,777
See? Idea!

2110
02:00:52,756 --> 02:00:55,088
Welcome, Madam - Please
tune into UBTV please.

2111
02:00:55,192 --> 02:00:56,250
No problem, Madam.

2112
02:01:03,567 --> 02:01:06,092
It is Vaman Rao presenting you the news.

2113
02:01:06,603 --> 02:01:09,333
This is the first news
program being presented..

2114
02:01:09,473 --> 02:01:10,906
..by UBTV and we assure our viewers..

2115
02:01:11,008 --> 02:01:12,805
..that we'll make all out
efforts to bring you the truth..

2116
02:01:12,909 --> 02:01:14,774
..and shall be in the
forefront on that count.

2117
02:01:14,945 --> 02:01:18,039
When opposition party is
offering 2000 bucks for a vote..

2118
02:01:18,315 --> 02:01:21,443
..the ruling party is
offering only 1500 bucks..

2119
02:01:21,718 --> 02:01:23,913
Claiming this, people from
Ponnur mandal in Guntur district..

2120
02:01:24,054 --> 02:01:27,046
..Pochipalem village residents
have started an agitation

2121
02:01:27,157 --> 02:01:28,681
They have boycotted voting.

2122
02:01:29,126 --> 02:01:31,822
But still there was 75 percent voting..

2123
02:01:31,928 --> 02:01:34,055
He is Vaman Rao and
has a fantastic voice..

2124
02:01:35,098 --> 02:01:37,328
Famour cine star Kirit Kumar..

2125
02:01:37,601 --> 02:01:41,093
..if you want to know what
his second son Virat Kumar is doing..

2126
02:01:41,338 --> 02:01:43,738
..keep watching the evening news!

2127
02:01:44,508 --> 02:01:47,170
By God! How hard is this
job of news reading, Subba Reddy!

2128
02:01:52,449 --> 02:01:54,246
Hey, check it at the top! - Kalyani!

2129
02:01:55,118 --> 02:01:57,143
Could anyone see my shorts
when I was reading the news?

2130
02:01:57,487 --> 02:02:01,150
Tell your Venky that pants
are not important for news reading..

2131
02:02:01,558 --> 02:02:02,957
One must have courage in his heart..

2132
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,525
We are live on air, sir.. - Live!

2133
02:02:04,628 --> 02:02:06,255
Is it not a break?!

2134
02:02:07,698 --> 02:02:09,757
Welcome back to evening news..

2135
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,434
Famous cine star Kirit Kumar's..

2136
02:02:12,636 --> 02:02:14,968
..second son Virat Kumar is also..

2137
02:02:15,272 --> 02:02:17,797
..set to enter the
cine field in near future.

2138
02:02:18,008 --> 02:02:20,533
For the same, to give a fillip
to his acting, he is learning..

2139
02:02:20,677 --> 02:02:23,737
..horse-riding, karate, gymnastics..

2140
02:02:24,047 --> 02:02:27,642
..culturing silk worms etc..
and for the same he went to Hollywood.

2141
02:02:32,189 --> 02:02:34,623
Now we present business news.. - What?!

2142
02:02:35,926 --> 02:02:38,451
The stock market
has crashed in a heap..

2143
02:02:38,562 --> 02:02:40,757
On monday, Nifty hit its first block..

2144
02:02:40,864 --> 02:02:42,729
..at 5722.

2145
02:02:42,833 --> 02:02:45,996
The first support value is 5544.

2146
02:02:46,570 --> 02:02:48,162
Why is he getting so confused?

2147
02:02:48,505 --> 02:02:49,972
Stock market news is like that!

2148
02:02:50,474 --> 02:02:52,999
For several prominent
cities across the country..

2149
02:02:53,110 --> 02:02:54,441
..we bring you the weather bulletin.

2150
02:02:57,481 --> 02:02:59,676
Venky, this is your chance!

2151
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:04,452
1-2-3.. roll!

2152
02:03:05,555 --> 02:03:07,989
I am N Venkateswara Rao
with the weather updates..

2153
02:03:08,458 --> 02:03:09,618
Oh.. shucks! - Venky!

2154
02:03:10,527 --> 02:03:12,427
What is Venky doing there?

2155
02:03:14,264 --> 02:03:15,458
First, we go to Delhi!

2156
02:03:16,133 --> 02:03:19,125
Normally the max temp
over here should be about 25.

2157
02:03:19,369 --> 02:03:20,768
And the min hovers around 15..

2158
02:03:22,005 --> 02:03:26,772
I never been to Delhi.. but
it is here that my Prabhavati was born..

2159
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:28,807
That's why I like that city a lot..

2160
02:03:32,516 --> 02:03:34,450
Next come Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai..

2161
02:03:34,818 --> 02:03:36,752
Let's drop these and come to Vizag..

2162
02:03:37,154 --> 02:03:38,246
I don't know much
about the weather here..

2163
02:03:38,388 --> 02:03:40,049
..but met Prabhavati here.
- Hey, your son-in-law!

2164
02:03:40,257 --> 02:03:41,918
What is he doing on Uday TV?

2165
02:03:42,259 --> 02:03:45,319
One afternoon to see movie
Jalsa at Mourya theatre..

2166
02:03:45,562 --> 02:03:46,859
C-16 and C-17 the seat numbers..

2167
02:03:47,364 --> 02:03:48,797
I bought the tickets
in black for a 100 each..

2168
02:03:50,834 --> 02:03:53,769
The two months that summer we
roamed all over Vizag.. - I'm coming..

2169
02:03:54,504 --> 02:03:58,201
Dolphin's nose,
RK beach, Kailashgiri etc..

2170
02:03:58,408 --> 02:04:02,310
But after that for two years,
the summers of 2011 and 2012..

2171
02:04:02,679 --> 02:04:04,977
..I went back to Vizag
but Prabhavati didn't come.

2172
02:04:05,816 --> 02:04:06,942
What?!

2173
02:04:07,451 --> 02:04:09,009
You went to Vizag for me?!

2174
02:04:09,186 --> 02:04:11,347
After four years, I and Prabha..

2175
02:04:11,788 --> 02:04:14,848
..met in Hyderabad again
under unexpected circumstances.

2176
02:04:15,325 --> 02:04:16,383
Prabha!

2177
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:20,828
Your eyes must have seen a different
person.. but your heart saw the real me.

2178
02:04:21,665 --> 02:04:24,225
I still love you, Prabha..
It is me who you liked..

2179
02:04:24,534 --> 02:04:25,728
..and it only you that I love.

2180
02:04:26,102 --> 02:04:27,763
I don't want to leave you this time.

2181
02:04:32,075 --> 02:04:33,064
Kalyani!

2182
02:04:33,176 --> 02:04:34,700
It was because some commented
about you at the beach..

2183
02:04:34,811 --> 02:04:36,142
..that I picked a fight there..

2184
02:04:36,246 --> 02:04:38,271
What was the result.. a broken jaw!

2185
02:04:39,616 --> 02:04:40,776
May I tell you something?

2186
02:04:40,984 --> 02:04:43,350
If they comment about you again,
I will fight them once more!

2187
02:04:43,753 --> 02:04:45,584
You know why? I still love you!

2188
02:04:46,990 --> 02:04:48,855
You asked me many times
that day on Necklace road..

2189
02:04:49,092 --> 02:04:51,822
..I couldn't tell you that I like you.
But today I tell you..

2190
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:54,897
I love you so much, Prabha..

2191
02:04:55,098 --> 02:04:59,034
I really love you..
in the past, present and forever!

2192
02:05:01,271 --> 02:05:04,832
Shiri! Shiri!

2193
02:05:05,141 --> 02:05:07,006
I want to talk to you..

2194
02:05:07,811 --> 02:05:08,971
She is going away!

2195
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,107
Hey.. who are you after all?!

2196
02:05:12,315 --> 02:05:14,180
Chinta Gurumurty!
- What do I care who you are?!

2197
02:05:14,618 --> 02:05:16,518
Why are you obstructing me?

2198
02:05:20,357 --> 02:05:21,847
Hey, what is the problem with you?!

2199
02:05:22,125 --> 02:05:24,650
No marriage or marriage proposals!

2200
02:05:24,794 --> 02:05:27,422
Hey! Hey! Let me out!

2201
02:05:35,405 --> 02:05:36,838
Auto! Will you take me to UBTV office?

2202
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:38,373
I will take you to
Ajay TV office.. - What?!

2203
02:05:43,513 --> 02:05:46,448
I know Hyderabad auto guys well..
Let me talk to him!

2204
02:05:47,851 --> 02:05:50,752
Auto, will you take you to
Ajay TV office? - I'll go to UBTV..

2205
02:05:50,854 --> 02:05:52,549
Get in now! Take her to that place..

2206
02:05:53,256 --> 02:05:56,225
H4.. kids..
their school in Edison! - Let's go!

2207
02:05:56,326 --> 02:05:58,590
Marriage..
remember me? - Go fast! - This is Goa!

2208
02:05:58,929 --> 02:06:01,159
If Prabha agrees,
we'll have our honeymoon at this place.

2209
02:06:02,232 --> 02:06:04,257
Else it could be Shimla or even Manali.

2210
02:06:05,068 --> 02:06:06,296
Wherever Prabhavati wants to go.

2211
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:10,972
Venky!

2212
02:06:17,314 --> 02:06:19,646
So it is you who ran the
entire story in the background!

2213
02:06:19,749 --> 02:06:22,741
Yes, I'm not only Venky
but also very cocky!

2214
02:06:23,386 --> 02:06:24,546
You scoundrel!

2215
02:06:24,821 --> 02:06:25,913
Ah! - How dare you?!

2216
02:06:26,022 --> 02:06:27,319
Is it you who wrote that letter too?

2217
02:06:27,691 --> 02:06:28,953
The script is mine..

2218
02:06:29,593 --> 02:06:31,857
..but directed and produced
by my boss! - Boss!

2219
02:06:33,396 --> 02:06:34,556
Why are you beating me?

2220
02:06:35,365 --> 02:06:36,161
You!

2221
02:06:47,410 --> 02:06:49,071
Would you play with
my feelings like this?

2222
02:06:49,446 --> 02:06:52,108
I had no other option -
Why did you tell so many lies?

2223
02:06:52,782 --> 02:06:53,908
I had to do it, Prabha.

2224
02:06:54,751 --> 02:06:56,514
It was you who wrote
that song too, right?

2225
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:59,050
Such lies! - What about you?

2226
02:06:59,556 --> 02:07:01,547
Didn't you ask him to come up?

2227
02:07:01,758 --> 02:07:03,817
It is you that I called! - Is it?!

2228
02:07:04,260 --> 02:07:05,659
But it wasn't I who came up.

2229
02:07:05,829 --> 02:07:07,228
Neither was it me who
put the ring on your finger.

2230
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:08,556
And when I proposed
the Friday meeting..

2231
02:07:08,665 --> 02:07:09,996
..you had a dinner
program with Mr. Uday..

2232
02:07:10,367 --> 02:07:12,597
..and lied to me that you have
some other work to attend! - Venky!

2233
02:07:12,902 --> 02:07:16,429
I wanted to meet Mr.
Uday to reveal the truth to him.

2234
02:07:21,011 --> 02:07:23,104
Guys.. just relax!

2235
02:07:24,381 --> 02:07:25,473
Phone my Pinky..

2236
02:07:47,704 --> 02:07:49,001
This is great..

2237
02:08:04,521 --> 02:08:06,921
Hello! - Sir,
our program is a great hit!

2238
02:08:07,123 --> 02:08:09,648
Is it so? - Our TRP ratings
have beaten the competition!

2239
02:08:09,826 --> 02:08:11,123
Thank you! Thank you very much!

2240
02:08:12,529 --> 02:08:14,053
Sir! Did you see this?

2241
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:19,090
Please dismiss him immediately, sir!

2242
02:08:21,971 --> 02:08:23,199
Hello! - My boy!

2243
02:08:23,573 --> 02:08:24,938
Did you see the TV today? - I did..

2244
02:08:25,075 --> 02:08:26,633
That's why I came to
dismiss him right away!

2245
02:08:26,743 --> 02:08:29,303
You fool! Did you see how
many people watched the news today?

2246
02:08:29,446 --> 02:08:30,708
Venky has become a big star now!

2247
02:08:30,847 --> 02:08:32,542
We'll get a very bad
name if we dismiss him now..

2248
02:08:32,649 --> 02:08:35,379
What about his treachery? - Our
TRP ratings are higher than competition!

2249
02:08:35,618 --> 02:08:37,142
TRP ratings are important
than personal issues..

2250
02:08:37,287 --> 02:08:38,982
Is that your final say?
- Don't you agree?

2251
02:08:40,056 --> 02:08:41,318
What about my situation, sir?

2252
02:08:45,028 --> 02:08:47,019
Are you suffering financially?

2253
02:08:48,131 --> 02:08:50,065
Are you going through family problems?

2254
02:08:50,934 --> 02:08:52,868
Is you health on a thin line?

2255
02:08:53,636 --> 02:08:56,605
If worshipped properly
even lord Shani gives blessings.

2256
02:08:57,240 --> 02:08:59,731
So buy today the yantra
for appeasing lord Shani!

2257
02:09:00,243 --> 02:09:03,576
It will cost you only Rs.199
if you order immediately..

2258
02:09:04,013 --> 02:09:06,311
Cameraman, hope it is presented well..

2259
02:09:11,588 --> 02:09:15,183
I take your leave.. For latest
news updates stay tuned into UBTV.

2260
02:09:19,529 --> 02:09:20,461
Venky!

2261
02:09:20,630 --> 02:09:22,598
So you have become
a news reader at last!

2262
02:09:22,732 --> 02:09:24,996
What did you do to your boss?
- What else?

2263
02:09:25,168 --> 02:09:26,328
I can't shed him midway!

2264
02:09:31,941 --> 02:09:33,602
There is something stuck to your face..

2265
02:09:34,410 --> 02:09:35,377
What is it?

2266
02:09:36,112 --> 02:09:37,204
Is it gone? - No..

2267
02:09:38,081 --> 02:09:39,378
A little towards the right..
over there..

2268
02:09:41,050 --> 02:09:42,381
Beauty got stuck to your face..

2269
02:09:42,786 --> 02:09:45,346
Oh.. but beauty can't
be wiped away from the face!

2270
02:09:45,455 --> 02:09:46,979
Beauty.. is it?

2271
02:10:02,238 --> 02:10:03,262
Action!

2272
02:10:14,350 --> 02:10:17,683
"Find it.. find it.."

2273
02:10:18,054 --> 02:10:22,047
"..find out what you feel.."

2274
02:10:22,525 --> 02:10:26,518
"In the beginning and in the end.."

2275
02:10:26,863 --> 02:10:30,697
"..the difference
between your feelings."

2276
02:10:31,134 --> 02:10:35,127
"When you reach your goal.."

2277
02:10:35,505 --> 02:10:39,703
"..find the joy that you experience."

2278
02:10:40,076 --> 02:10:43,876
"The happiness of your friendship.."

2279
02:10:44,147 --> 02:10:48,550
"..cannot be expressed in words."

2280
02:10:48,651 --> 02:10:49,583
"Is that so?"

2281
02:10:52,789 --> 02:10:54,279
"I don't know!"

2282
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:58,286
"Is that so?"

2283
02:10:59,262 --> 02:11:00,456
"I don't know!"

2284
02:11:01,497 --> 02:11:02,657
"Is that so?"

2285
02:11:03,633 --> 02:11:04,657
"I don't know!"
