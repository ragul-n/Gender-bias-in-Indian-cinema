00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:34,850
Please come. Sleep. Sleep

4
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,980
Why don't you come?

5
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:46,190
And put my daughter to sleep

6
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:52,110
Come and close these
little eyes and make her sleep

7
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:02,360
I am coming. I am coming

8
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,890
And put your daughter to sleep

9
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,030
I will make her sleep

10
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,860
Sweet dreams

11
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:18,260
Please come. Sleep. Sleep

12
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,960
Why don't you come?

13
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,920
And put my daughter to sleep

14
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,680
Come and close these
little eyes and make her sleep

15
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:47,280
When the rays of the
morning sun brightened the world

16
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,770
And the buds blossomed

17
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,890
The bird danced and
chirped and, "Wake up, darling."

18
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,210
"The whole world has awakened"

19
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,230
Beautiful and unique

20
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,450
Who is the most
beautiful of them all?

21
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,400
My darling daughter

22
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,100
The heart pleaser.
One of a kind. Loveable

23
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,760
When the daughter
smiles in her mother's lap...

24
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,310
and shows her nuances...

25
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,200
she just wins your heart

26
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,720
Her pretty face is so endearing

27
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,810
Pretty. And unique

28
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:14,180
When the rays of the
morning sun brightened the world

29
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,370
And the buds blossomed

30
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,280
The bird danced and chirped,
"Wake up, darling."

31
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,560
"The whole world has awakened"

32
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,410
Beautiful and unique

33
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,320
Who is the most
beautiful of them all?

34
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,050
My darling daughter

35
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:48,690
The heart pleaser.
One of a kind. Loveable

36
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:57,310
When the daughter
smiles in her mother's lap

37
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:03,310
And shows her nuances

38
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,400
She would just win your heart

39
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,020
Her pretty face is so endearing

40
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,650
Pretty. And unique

41
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,860
Oh, mother.

42
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,760
Oh my! Our family is now blessed
with the third generation too.

43
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,110
Daughter-in-law,
daughter and her daughter.

44
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,190
- Whose daughter is she?
- Mine.

45
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,810
- And you?
- My father's.

46
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,470
And mother's, too.

47
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,440
She's shivering outside in the cold.

48
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,700
She barely has any clothes on.

49
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,170
Why don't you explain
to your daughter, Champa?

50
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,240
She's already lost
two kids like this.

51
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,600
It's not her fault.

52
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,670
If her husband was a nice man...

53
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,580
But Champa didn't choose her husband.

54
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,820
You chose a drunkard
worthless man for her.

55
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,280
Ma'am, I had no idea
he'd turn out like that.

56
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,500
Anyway, take the flower.

57
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,100
If you don't accept, your
uncle's heart will be broken.

58
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,780
First promise you'll get
woollen clothes for your daughter.

59
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,620
Okay. Okay. I promise
I'll get woollens.

60
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080
Accept it at least now, dear.

61
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,510
Yes. Now I'll accept it.

62
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,580
God bless.

63
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,980
I can't help it, dear.

64
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,940
My family is so big.

65
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,870
There is my daughter, son.
Their sons and daughters.

66
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,100
Tell me. How many mouths do I feed?

67
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,030
You'll have to feed everyone
since they're your family.

68
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,616
May I ask you something?

69
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,070
Please ask your father
to give me a raise.

70
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,706
Not much.

71
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,820
- I expect just Rs.150 per month.
- That's it?

72
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,770
- Yes, ma'am,
- Fine.

73
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,780
Oh. I am really late for college.

74
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,350
Our daughter is a Goddess.

75
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,150
She dotes on the kids.

76
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,810
May God bless her!

77
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,540
Our Nirmala will be an ideal mother.

78
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,770
Only if her fiance Loknath also
turns out to be an ideal father.

79
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,250
I can't say if he does
for his own children.

80
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,310
He's a tyrant for others' children.

81
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,280
I went to see his mother
a day before she died.

82
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,010
I had just stepped into the house...

83
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,050
and the moans and groans of the
children just tore my heart out.

84
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,980
What I saw was that Loknath...

85
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,090
I didn't tell this to Nirmala...

86
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,050
or she wouldn't have liked
even talking to Loknath.

87
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,520
But she must know what kind of
a man her future husband is.

88
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,176
Didn't you hear?

89
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,460
She was telling the
gardener just now that...

90
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,650
he was responsible for choosing
such a bad husband for his daughter.

91
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,920
Nirmala won't be
happy with Loknath.

92
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,260
Can't help it.

93
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,600
Loknath's mother kept telling me
just this till her last breath.

94
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,646
That do fulfill the
promise of Loknath...

95
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,720
and Nirmala's marriage
made when they were young.

96
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,330
We must think of
Nirmala's happiness first.

97
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,960
It's important for Nirmala
to get a match worthy of her.

98
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,830
Hello, Loknath. Aren't you ready yet?

99
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,060
Aren't you coming to hunt today?

100
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,760
No. That wounded deer
escaped us yesterday.

101
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,160
We must find it.

102
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:56,260
Brajnath, today I'll not
chase a deer, but my sweetheart.

103
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,980
- Why? Has she also run away?
- Look.

104
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,600
Is it in the newspaper too?

105
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,180
Wow!

106
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,790
Nirmala tops the university.

107
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,790
You must be really happy.

108
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,570
- Yes. Very happy.
- Why?

109
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,410
Why would you be happy?

110
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,770
Your wife is a B.A. graduate,
and the husband is F.A. fail.

111
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,520
It's not that.

112
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,120
Actually, I don't want
Nirmala to pursue her M.A.

113
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,676
Because in that scenario,
the marriage...

114
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,350
will be postponed
another two years.

115
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,040
I see. That's why you're off
in pursuit of a female deer.

116
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,020
Mother, you go and rest. I'll
make the arrangements for the party.

117
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,520
The girls will be here any minute.

118
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,360
Nirmala, your letter.

119
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,020
- Who's it from?
- Loknath.

120
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,940
I see.

121
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,060
He's coming.

122
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,380
Yes.

123
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,290
He's coming to
congratulate her personally.

124
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,090
Congratulations! He'll
only harass her when he comes.

125
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,580
Congratulations! Congratulations!

126
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,700
- You've passed with flying colors.
- Tops in the university.

127
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,766
You've saved the girls
from being disgraced.

128
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,460
You beat all the boys to the post.

129
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,300
- A boy, too, has stood first.
- Who?

130
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,230
Read the newspaper.

131
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,380
Did you notice? He jumped
to the boys' defense so quickly.

132
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,060
That's why he's jealous of
even his daughter's achievement.

133
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,690
It's not that.

134
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,200
That's exactly what it is.

135
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,100
You might well not admit it.

136
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,090
Okay. Okay. Now let the girls enjoy.

137
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,050
So who is this? Mr. Ramdas?

138
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,750
- How should I know?
- Who else would know?

139
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,630
Is he with you all
the time or with us?

140
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,750
She just doesn't know him.
Poor thing.

141
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,470
- Is he from your college?
- No.

142
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,670
He must be from some other college.

143
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,850
- Congratulations. Congratulations.
- Congratulations. Congratulations.

144
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,100
Ladies and Gentlemen.

145
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,490
Look before you speak.
There's no lady here.

146
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,850
Yes, and no gentlemen, either.

147
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Okay. That's why, my
useful and useless friends.

148
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,050
I mean, achievers and non-achievers.

149
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,280
Great. Great.

150
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,500
Since the responsibility
of congratulating our friend Ramdas...

151
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,350
has been put on my
weak shoulders, that's why...

152
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,540
Wait!

153
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,900
It wasn't put on you.
You volunteered.

154
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,700
Because old habits die hard.

155
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,000
Why are you over the moon, Ramdas?

156
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,660
You're a guest at this celebration.

157
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,080
That's why you can
speak your mind at the end.

158
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,820
Let me speak first.

159
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,509
- Listen.
- Okay. Okay. Sit, Ramdas.

160
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,110
Sit. Sit.

161
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,639
Yes. So what was I saying?

162
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,739
Well, your last word was 'listen'.

163
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,060
Wow. Thanks for the help.

164
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,800
You've gone crazy for sure.

165
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,200
So, I was trying to say that
this is a matter of great shame.

166
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,360
A matter of great pride.
I mean a matter of great pride.

167
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,870
Ramdas, you've made me forget
everything by interrupting me.

168
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,730
You'll not get any
congratulations now.

169
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,570
Who the heck wants it?

170
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,056
Is this an achievement,
equaling a girl?

171
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,520
Who the heck is congratulating you
on your achievement?

172
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,170
Listen.

173
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,910
Since Ramdas didn't let
a girl beat the boys in the exams...

174
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,720
he deserves a reward.

175
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,370
And this gathering's
decision is that only...

176
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,250
Ramdas be considered
worthy of that girl among all men.

177
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,180
Right. Right.

178
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,140
And this gathering's
order is that just as...

179
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,350
these two were
together in the exams...

180
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,350
they will be together for life, too.

181
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,430
Absolutely. Correct.

182
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,806
Great. I haven't seen her.
Who is she?

183
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,356
Where's she from?
How is she?

184
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,786
I don't accept this order.

185
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:30,720
You'll have to accept.
You'll have to accept it

186
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,870
You might or might not know.
You will have to know

187
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,000
You'll have to accept
her as your life partner.

188
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,490
Wow! What if she is dark and ugly?

189
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,650
What if she is blind,
a bumpkin and really bad?

190
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,530
Even then. Even then,
you'll have to accept this

191
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,470
You'll have to accept her
as your life partner.

192
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,830
Take us to Ms. Nirmala's house.

193
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,610
Why?

194
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,340
You changed your mind?

195
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,910
- You got scared of the police?
- No.

196
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,280
I thought you'd be disgraced.

197
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,630
And your image will remain clean.

198
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,830
Nirmala, I'm ashamed of my mistake.

199
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,550
I didn't know the matter
would become so serious.

200
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,010
It's good that you
handled the situation.

201
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,490
Otherwise,
I would have been slandered.

202
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,750
Forgive me, Nirmala.

203
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,900
I can't face anyone in your house.

204
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,570
Let it be.
As you sow, so you shall reap.

205
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,530
I won't mention it to anyone.

206
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,330
But you'll have
to face the outcome.

207
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,490
No.

208
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,120
The driver returned just
now with an empty car.

209
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,090
He says the college was closed
and Nirmala was nowhere to be seen.

210
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,400
Really?

211
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll be right there, aunt.

212
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,960
Nirmala.

213
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,416
You have come, dear.

214
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,930
What happened, Nirmala?
Where did you go?

215
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,726
The driver went to the
college to pick you up. But...

216
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,830
I didn't go to the
college today, mother.

217
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,390
I went out with Mr. Loknath.

218
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,710
- With Mr. Loknath?
- Yes, mother.

219
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,380
Didn't you see?

220
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,730
So cleverly she changed
the table in an instant.

221
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,790
That's why I say that nobody
does it for someone needlessly.

222
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,790
Especially women.

223
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,330
She was upset with you.

224
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,390
You were taking her against her wish.

225
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,150
Still, she took your side.

226
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,180
I can say with certainty
that she loves you.

227
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,620
I wish it were true.

228
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,220
It means Nirmala likes Loknath.

229
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,390
Exactly.

230
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,500
She skipped college
to go out with him.

231
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,640
Now I understand.

232
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,020
Do you remember?

233
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,480
Loknath said that when
he mentioned marriage...

234
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,580
Nirmala said, 'Ask my parents'.

235
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,730
Nirmala is a shy girl.

236
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,880
And she believes in old
customs and traditions.

237
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,520
One thing is good.

238
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,310
We'll be able to fulfill the promise.

239
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,830
Yes.

240
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,310
Now, Nirmala has become mature.

241
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,230
I wanted her
to get married this year.

242
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,640
Good.

243
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,520
I'll ask the priest to fix
an auspicious marriage date.

244
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,140
Ramnath. Ramnath.
Stop. Stop.

245
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,720
Why didn't you come to college?
You all the spoiled the fun.

246
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,306
Where did you go?

247
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,500
Don't ask anything. Today
I was made a laughingstock.

248
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,620
Nothing new there.

249
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,000
- It happens every day.
- What happened today?

250
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,540
It's a long story.
I'll tell you at home. Come.

251
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,650
Instead of thanking him,
I rebuked him.

252
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,520
And I mocked him
in front of everyone.

253
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,800
- When I think about it...
- I feel bad.

254
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,640
It's natural.

255
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,430
Let it be. Who was that gentleman?

256
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,030
I don't know.

257
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,350
Seems to be college boys.

258
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,160
He was gentlemanly. He was brave.

259
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,720
Handsome.

260
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,870
It seems to be a serious matter.

261
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,890
Tell me the whole story.

262
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,320
Don't tell anyone.
I promised Mr. Loknath.

263
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,330
I will protect your promise.

264
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,910
Don't worry.

265
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,580
I don't know who she was
or from where she had come.

266
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,520
But she was someone.

267
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,280
- Was she beautiful?
- Yes.

268
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,920
Do whatever you want.

269
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,020
Don't feel bad.

270
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,400
We thought you had
eloped with Nirmala.

271
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,080
Who is Nirmala?

272
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,590
The girl who scored
the same rank as you in BA.

273
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,570
She has taken
admission in our college.

274
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,270
- Is that so?
- Yes.

275
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,590
We didn't tell you so
you'd be surprised...

276
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,910
when you met her unexpectedly.

277
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,436
And you created a new scene.

278
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,430
You got into trouble.
You were mocked.

279
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,630
And you don't know who that girl was.

280
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,210
If I knew his whereabouts,
I would have gone right away...

281
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,460
to apologize to him.
And to thank him.

282
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:22,310
Why not? But his image has been
imprinted in your mind.

283
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,910
Give his description to the police.

284
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,960
Why did you laugh?

285
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,920
I feel like laughing
at the mention of the police.

286
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,900
When they mentioned the police...

287
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,840
Loknath's reaction was worth seeing.

288
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,000
Really?

289
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,480
He got really scared.

290
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,300
I stopped him.

291
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,110
Hats off to you.

292
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,230
A girl fooled four young boys.

293
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,210
Loknath must be
really grateful to you.

294
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,060
Is it from the girl?

295
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,730
- Who...
- Made you crazy and disappeared.

296
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,476
Maybe she felt pity for you.

297
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,220
Felt pity or had a change of heart.

298
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,660
Quiet. It's from mother.
She's returning tonight.

299
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,460
Let me see.

300
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,250
What is it? What is it?

301
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,500
His mother has chosen a
beautiful girl for him in Benaras.

302
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,500
What's this about?
Will you marry or not?

303
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,560
His mother has chosen a girl for him.

304
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,900
And we've decided on Nirmala.

305
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,150
You had a tryst with that girl.

306
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,736
Tell me. How to solve this?

307
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,200
- Don't worry. It'll be solved tomorrow.
- How?

308
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,330
When he confronts Nirmala,
everybody will be stunned.

309
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,110
Yes. I've heard she's
as beautiful as she is virtuous.

310
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,600
It's the same girl.

311
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,410
Who?

312
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,270
Yesterday I hwent to release her.

313
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,780
Really?

314
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,490
Has she come to complain about me?

315
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,470
This is Nirmala.

316
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,170
You have read and
heard a lot about her.

317
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,370
You'll be pleased to learn that...

318
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,920
she'll be studying
in our college.

319
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,870
Let me introduce you to Ramdas.

320
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,990
You haven't met him, have you?

321
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,880
Ramdas, come here.

322
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,550
Ramdas.
Nirmala.

323
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,500
Both of you achieved the
same score in this exam.

324
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,800
Let's see who comes
first in the next exam.

325
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,036
Please say a few words.
Please say a few words.

326
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,510
Speech, speech, speech.

327
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,460
I would like to say something.

328
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:01,140
As Nirmala and Ramdas
didn't accept our request...

329
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,200
if you permit, I would
like to say a few words.

330
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,810
Go ahead. But speak well.

331
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,320
And not incoherently.

332
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,940
Yes. And keep it short.

333
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,550
Okay.

334
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,330
As Nirmala and Ramdas scored
equally in the exams...

335
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,760
it is but natural for
them to sit on the same bench.

336
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,080
Nirmala will decide.

337
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:59,910
Okay. Today I will discuss...

338
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:07,680
how history relates to our lives.

339
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,410
And...

340
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,890
Nirmala is our only child.
You know.

341
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,440
We got her engaged
to Loknath in childhood.

342
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,106
Later we worried
whether she would like...

343
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,020
Loknath after she grew up.

344
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,790
God has alleviated our worry.

345
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,760
Please fix such an auspicious
marriage date that Nirmala...

346
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,540
enjoys eternal marital
bliss and her husband's love.

347
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,330
Look, dear.

348
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,270
I have chosen this date.

349
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,830
Savitri and Satyavan got married
on the same day.

350
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,410
You know their story.

351
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,530
Even death couldn't separate them.

352
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,860
The girl who gets
married on this date...

353
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,540
her husband will always love her.

354
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,766
Have you fixed the marriage date?

355
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,670
Yes. Look.

356
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,000
Not many days are left.

357
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,960
We'll have to make the
arrangements very quickly.

358
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,030
You have come, Loknath?

359
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,680
Today we had
to fix the marriage date.

360
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,820
That's why I called you.

361
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,820
Sit.

362
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,780
The priest has found
an auspicious date.

363
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,360
It's not far.

364
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,380
Isn't this what you wanted?

365
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,630
Yes.

366
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,900
If Nirmala had also come,
I'd have blessed them both.

367
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,580
I have to go elsewhere.

368
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,780
She should have come by now.

369
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,020
Where is she?

370
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,740
Pramila asked her to come
to her house for tea after classes.

371
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,080
She must have gone there.

372
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,330
- The same man whom you fooled?
- Yes.

373
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,040
- It must have been embarrassing.
- I couldn't look into his eyes.

374
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:31,890
Eyes don't meet
after hearts have united.

375
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,490
Get lost.

376
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,220
Today I'll study him closely.

377
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,840
And describe his features to you.

378
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,990
Bear it in mind
and worship him every day.

379
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,830
Tell me. Who will worship him?

380
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,506
You or me?

381
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,930
I don't know who.

382
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,510
I don't know who.

383
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
Look into my eyes.

384
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
Get lost.

385
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,520
I'll be late.

386
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,700
You come, too.

387
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,700
Stay at my house for the night.
We'll talk some more.

388
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:10,400
- Tell me. Will you come?
- Let's go.

389
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,620
Hello. Who?

390
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,940
Hello.

391
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,340
Hello.

392
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,500
Did you hear the bell?

393
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,130
I didn't hear it.

394
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,670
I rang it. For the servant.

395
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,150
Why?

396
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,580
Nothing. Tea from the hotel...

397
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,860
Forgive me. I forgot.

398
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,360
Sir.

399
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,170
What?

400
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,330
Nothing. Go.

401
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,490
Since when did you become forgetful?

402
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,390
Why?

403
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,800
When you saw Nirmala
for the first time...

404
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,160
you forgot everything
and ran after her.

405
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,850
Today, when she came,
you become so forgetful...

406
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,800
that you forgot to tell her.

407
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,730
Everybody spoke to her,
but you said nothing.

408
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,050
What could I have said?

409
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,300
The same thing you're
thinking right now.

410
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,720
Tell me. Am I right?

411
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,550
What do I say?

412
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,400
Nothing. This ailment is such...

413
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,430
you don't say anything.
You just think.

414
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,640
Don't worry.

415
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,670
You're lucky to have
such a virtuous wife.

416
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,840
She'll handle the house quickly.

417
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,630
Look. She has come.

418
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,980
Come, dear.

419
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,810
I have fixed an auspicious date
for your wedding.

420
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,500
Kamla and Nirmala
share the same destiny.

421
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,450
Both are destined
for eternal marital bliss...

422
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,729
and her husband's love.

423
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,180
So also are you.

424
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,780
Nirmala's marriage?

425
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,250
Yes. With Loknath.

426
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,210
She is feeling shy.

427
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:49,270
Nobody knows

428
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:58,360
The pain of this wounded heart

429
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:34,080
A fire burns within me

430
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:43,400
Nobody sees the smoke

431
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,010
Since the time her
marriage has been fixed...

432
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,820
this has been her plight

433
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Only the one who is
pierced can feel the pain

434
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:23,530
Nobody else

435
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:31,340
Nobody understands this pain

436
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:39,560
The pain of this wounded heart

437
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,530
Pramila, did you see that?

438
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,060
Yes.

439
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,846
We raised the topic of
Nirmala's marriage to Loknath...

440
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,380
thinking it would make her happy.

441
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,490
Did we make a mistake?

442
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,320
Shall I tell you the truth?

443
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,870
Yes, dear.

444
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,540
That's why we have called you.

445
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,080
You're her friend.

446
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,220
You must know her feelings.

447
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,860
If this marriage takes place,
Nirmala will always be unhappy.

448
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,790
She doesn't love Loknath.

449
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,000
She is educated, virtuous,
beautiful and good-natured.

450
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,020
Aunt, Nirmala and Ramdas'
match is made in heaven.

451
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,960
That Benaras girl must be
nothing compared to her.

452
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,800
You think Ramdas likes her?

453
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,750
I don't just think it.
I know it for sure.

454
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,750
What else can I want?

455
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,340
Daughter-in-law should be good.

456
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,560
Ramdas should like her.

457
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,660
She should be virtuous.

458
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,450
That Benaras girl is
not a perfect match.

459
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,310
Tell me everything about that girl.

460
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,630
He behaved like that with a
girl belonging to a decent family.

461
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,560
I will go to Loknath right
away and call off the wedding.

462
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,820
Look. What's done is done.

463
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,460
It's pointless to fight
with Loknath now.

464
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,430
Explain to him politely.

465
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,430
Uncle, he shouldn't
know that you know...

466
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,010
about Nirmala's unhappy state.

467
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,350
Go and tell Nirmala everything.

468
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,600
She'll feel better. Go.

469
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,040
I'll go right away.

470
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,780
But let me tell you one
more thing about Nirmala.

471
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,680
You'll be glad to hear this.

472
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,980
What? What?

473
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,660
Did you hear, aunt?
Now fix the wedding quickly.

474
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,110
Your wish should be fulfilled.

475
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,680
Ramdas should marry
the girl of his choice.

476
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,090
And we should get to eat
sweets to our heart's content.

477
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,690
Don't be so happy.

478
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,690
What if Nirmala's parents
reject the marriage alliance?

479
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:44,450
Reject?
Ramdas?

480
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,730
Is there any such
person in this world?

481
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,910
Aunt, you just have to talk to them.

482
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,040
Even if you talk to them on the
phone, the match will be fixed.

483
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,580
No. It can't be fixed
without meeting them.

484
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,550
So meet them this very day.

485
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,720
Fine. Give me their telephone number.

486
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,920
There's no need to see.

487
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,050
I know everything about them.

488
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,750
Talk to them.

489
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,090
Yes. Yes.

490
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,670
Wait a minute.

491
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,830
Aunt, Ramdas.

492
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,880
I mentioned him just now.

493
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,700
- It's his mother.
- No.

494
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:40,160
Yes. She wants to talk to you.

495
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,710
Come. Come.

496
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,160
I am Ramdas' mother.

497
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,760
Yes.

498
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,036
I have heard that your daughter...

499
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,630
has taken admission
in Ramdas' college.

500
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,150
Yes.

501
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,870
I wanted to ask you...

502
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,250
Yes.

503
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,310
Yes?

504
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,710
Yes.

505
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,010
Gladly.

506
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,210
I have heard many good
things about your son.

507
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,650
And...

508
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,490
What?

509
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,280
Yes, yes.

510
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,950
Come whenever you like.

511
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,310
It's your house.

512
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,530
Thanks.

513
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,190
- May I come today?
- Surely.

514
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,270
It's teatime.

515
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,020
Have tea with us.

516
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,900
Come soon.
The tea may get cold.

517
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,920
Okay. I'll come right away. Thanks.

518
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,960
She's a very nice woman.

519
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,630
Where did you go, Ramdas?

520
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,910
Poor Moti had to come
to call up in Benaras.

521
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,240
Yes. And I had to even talk to her.

522
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,250
She's a nice girl.

523
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,560
That girl in Benaras.

524
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,510
Yes. You've told me
countless times, mother.

525
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,750
I'm tired of hearing it.

526
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,290
Good people are bound
to be called good, son.

527
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,560
Right, Moti?

528
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,420
Yes, aunt.

529
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,510
She's very nice.

530
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,660
God bless you, son.

531
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,970
You've lifted a huge
burden from my mind.

532
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,990
If you permit, I'll
lift his burden as well.

533
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,770
Both of you handle it.

534
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,850
I have to go somewhere for tea.

535
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,490
She'll be here soon.
What will she say?

536
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:01,190
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

537
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,840
But she's aunt's best friend.
Best friend.

538
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,040
She's coming for tea.

539
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,370
Come on. Will you come or not?

540
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,550
No.

541
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,290
Why did you tell mother and father?

542
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,560
When did I tell you I
didn't want to marry Loknath?

543
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,850
You didn't tell me.
But I understood it.

544
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,080
You claim to be very sensible.

545
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,930
I'm feeling really shy.

546
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,750
More than you felt at college...

547
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,830
- in front of Ramdas?
- Get lost.

548
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,890
- You come. Otherwise...
- What?

549
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,420
I told them about Loknath.

550
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,356
I'll tell them about Ramdas
in the same way.

551
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,430
What will you say?
What is there to say?

552
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:46,250
Nothing. But there
are many things to say.

553
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,710
- Tell me. Will you get up?
- No.

554
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,710
Go and tell them.

555
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,870
No, my friend.
Why would I tell them?

556
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,510
If I had to say, I would
have told them at that time.

557
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,870
Come. Get up.

558
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,390
Look, this glowing face
has turned pale.

559
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,480
Come. Freshen up.
Change your clothes.

560
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,620
This isn't bad.

561
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,150
It's dirty.

562
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,000
You're a naughty girl.

563
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,360
I'm a girl, yes...

564
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,670
but only Lord Ram or
Ramdas knows who is naughty.

565
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,070
Wait.

566
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,560
I think you've found
a better groom than I.

567
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,500
- That's why.
- No, Loknath.

568
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,960
I'll have to search for a groom.

569
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,690
Were you less suitable?

570
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,630
You're my best friend's son.

571
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,530
I'd have been very happy
if you had married Nirmala.

572
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,150
- But...
- But?

573
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,180
Nirmala and you will
never be happy together.

574
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,450
Why not?

575
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,610
Because the two of you
have different temperaments.

576
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:09,360
- You only discovered this now?
- No.

577
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:15,100
I knew it before. But I became
convinced of it only recently.

578
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,800
- How?
- Forget it.

579
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:26,930
I assure you it wasn't easy
for me to make this decision.

580
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,310
But how did you find out all this?

581
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,150
Very easily.

582
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,060
Nirmala's friend Pramila
lives in my neighborhood.

583
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,470
And my sister is her friend.

584
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,390
Do you understand?

585
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,060
You're a fool.

586
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,916
I accept all this.

587
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,240
But when I went to save her,
why did she fool me?

588
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,670
To save herself from disgrace.

589
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,036
If she had come with you,
wouldn't this news...

590
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,060
have spread all over the city?

591
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,850
That Loknath ran away with Nirmala.

592
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,850
And Ramdas released her.

593
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,100
I didn't think of that.

594
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,410
How could you?
You need brains for that.

595
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:07,850
Is that so?

596
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,770
So this is your final decision?

597
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,120
Yes, Loknath.

598
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:21,440
I am sure that when you
think about it calmly...

599
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,450
you'll reach the same conclusion.

600
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,546
I hope that we will continue sharing...

601
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:36,250
good relations in
the future as well.

602
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,820
Yes.

603
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,040
Okay...

604
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:49,890
I'll leave now.

605
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,580
I've seen you somewhere.

606
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,410
I think so, too.

607
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,700
Sit. Sit.

608
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

609
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

610
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:25,230
This is Nirmala.

611
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,810
And her friend, Pramila.

612
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,820
I see. I see.

613
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,940
God bless you, dear.
God bless you.

614
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,010
Where have I seen you before?

615
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:43,930
Wait.

616
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,930
You've never been
to Jagannathpuri, have you?

617
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,090
Jagannath?

618
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,450
Yes. I did go there
once on pilgrimage.

619
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,480
It's been a long time.

620
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,550
Nirmala was small at that time.

621
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,590
- And you have a son.
- Yes.

622
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,980
Ramdas.

623
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,390
Yes.

624
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:08,030
Loknath's mother and we
stayed at the seaside.

625
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,990
Right. Now, I remember.

626
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,850
Give me. Give me.

627
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,960
Leave. Leave.

628
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,730
- It will break.
- No.

629
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:25,990
Leave.

630
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,610
My doll.

631
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:32,650
Good. Good.

632
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:36,720
- What happened? What happened?
- He broke it.

633
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,100
Don't cry. I'll fix it right away.

634
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
- Look.
- Yes. Yes.

635
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,090
You aren't her father. He is..

636
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,510
Him!

637
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,050
Ramu.
Ramdas.

638
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,140
It's him. It's him.

639
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,510
It's him. It's him. It's him.

640
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,520
- It's him.
- What are you doing? Move.

641
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,880
Naughty boy.

642
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,750
You started fighting here as well.

643
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,370
- Forgive me.
- No, children are bound to fight.

644
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,300
He's the cause of the problem.

645
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,010
I won't play with him.

646
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,740
I'll play with you.

647
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,570
What can you and I do?

648
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,780
They've already chosen each other.

649
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,820
Dear?

650
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,590
Listen.

651
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,200
She ran away.

652
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,090
I like your daughter.

653
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,280
It's my good fortune.

654
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,910
We shouldn't delay
this auspicious deed.

655
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:47,220
You said what I was going to say.

656
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:53,000
I myself want Ramdas to get
married as soon as possible.

657
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,150
According to Nirmala's horoscope...

658
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,240
there's a very
auspicious date next month.

659
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,620
There's only one
auspicious date next month.

660
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,740
And it matches with Ramdas' horoscope.

661
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,020
It's a great coincidence.

662
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:10,040
The gods have showered their
blessings on this marriage.

663
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,750
Fine. Let me see.

664
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,620
Not like that.

665
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,140
Cover your face, bride.

666
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,930
Yes, you aren't going to college now.

667
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,800
You're going to get married.

668
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:35,810
But why?
The groom is also modern.

669
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,680
Yes, I've heard instead of a horse,
he's coming in a car.

670
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,390
He's worn neither
traditional attire nor a flowery veil.

671
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:44,910
Make her modern, too.

672
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,360
Instead of a sari, let
her wear a modern dress.

673
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,400
- Will you wear it?
- No.

674
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,900
Don't act smugly.
You're not married yet.

675
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:02,080
If I want, I can still arrange
for you to marry Loknath.

676
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:14,210
Loknath won't attend the marriage?

677
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,120
- Is he still angry with you?
- No.

678
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,320
I thought so, too.
But it's been all cleared up now.

679
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:26,680
You didn't see the gift
Loknath has sent for Nirmala.

680
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,250
Who sent this?

681
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,870
Somebody must have sent it.
Ask the bride.

682
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,380
Bride.

683
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,550
I don't know who sent it.

684
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,540
Okay. Fine. Three guesses.

685
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,930
Guess correctly and win the prize.

686
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,070
Tell me.

687
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:54,910
Mohan. Zohra. Rampyari.

688
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,540
Neither Rampyari nor Ramdas.

689
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,400
- So?
- Loknath.

690
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,730
- Is that so?
- Why not?

691
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,140
If a thief stops thieving,
it doesn't mean...

692
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,890
he's stopped being dishonest.

693
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:17,660
Yes, he couldn't marry you
but he still loves you.

694
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,220
Lovers are very stubborn.
They don't give up.

695
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,020
You don't believe it?

696
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,660
Our beliefs are unimportant.

697
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,870
Ramdas has to accept it.

698
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,330
- Has the marriage procession left?
- Yes.

699
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,846
A long time ago.
They'll be here soon.

700
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:58,830
- Hello.
- Brajnath and Gehni.

701
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,990
You've come. And Loknath?

702
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,390
Over there.

703
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,720
- You have come, Loknath.
- Yes. Why wouldn't I come?

704
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:15,930
I'm glad to know you're
no longer angry with me.

705
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:19,600
You still love us the way
you used to love us before.

706
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:23,720
What are you saying?
Can that love ever die?

707
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,570
Doesn't he know his father
is your best friend?

708
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:28,910
Yes.

709
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,030
Loknath, why did you
send such an expensive gift?

710
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:34,400
- It's nothing.
- Okay. Fine.

711
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,730
- Sit. Feel at home.
- Yes.

712
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:43,080
- Nirmala Devi? Babu Rajnikant's daughter?
- Yes.

713
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,650
But she was supposed
to marry Mr. Loknath.

714
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,480
Yes, but Mr. Rajnikant cancelled it...

715
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,990
and fixed it with Mr. Ramdas.

716
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,730
They were supposed to
tie the knot today but...

717
00:54:56,290 --> 00:55:00,190
lnspector, to which Loknath
did you refer just now?

718
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,890
Is it that man who
lives at No. 3 Garden Lane?

719
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,240
- He's very wealthy?
- Yes, that's him.

720
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:12,390
I see. Then I was wrong.

721
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,240
Inspector, please do something soon.

722
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:20,590
What if the wedding hour passes
and there's no sign of Ramdas?

723
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,490
Wait. He's a detective.

724
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:28,000
It's possible he can help us
with this case.

725
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,680
Yes, sir, so what
did you misunderstand?

726
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:37,630
Pardon? Oh yes! I have just
investigated a serious matter...

727
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,470
whose case is being tried in court.

728
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:46,230
But because of some reason,
I thought perhaps...

729
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,350
Loknath was also involved in it.

730
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,160
But from the evidence of this
wedding procession...

731
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,980
I feel the matter
is something else.

732
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,260
What?

733
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:01,680
Will you listen to my
advice regarding this incident?

734
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,370
- Of course.
- Sure.

735
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,060
You were just telling the inspector...

736
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,980
that you were with Mr. Ramdas
when the incident took place.

737
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,840
Yes, I was sitting next to him.

738
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,810
I see. If you will see any of
the goons that attacked you...

739
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,000
would you recognize him?

740
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,960
- I think I'd definitely recognize him.
- Okay.

741
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:39,710
Do you know him?

742
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,280
He was the leader of those goons.

743
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,230
Go immediately and arrest Loknath.

744
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,700
But this isn't Loknath.

745
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,830
No. He's not Loknath...

746
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:01,160
but a known wanted criminal...

747
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:05,796
whose business is helping
criminals with honest fronts...

748
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:09,020
to perform serious crimes
for big profits.

749
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,180
This goon is also the culprit in my case.

750
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:19,910
Now listen. Loknath, who is
completely against this wedding...

751
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,360
if he gets this goon released
on bail tomorrow...

752
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,490
after this goon attacks
the wedding procession today...

753
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:35,100
and abducts the groom.
Now tell me, who is the real culprit?

754
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,900
Loknath.

755
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:48,750
Let's go.

756
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,750
Sit down, Mr. Groom.

757
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,190
Now stop worrying about your in-laws.

758
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:31,530
Our boss has gone there now.

759
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,110
He knows how to play the role
of groom better than you ever will.

760
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,840
Will you drink something?

761
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,780
- Will you eat something?
- No.

762
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:04,011
You would have eaten something
at your in-laws place, too.

763
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:07,870
There are only two in-laws.

764
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:11,010
Your wife's house or the jail.

765
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,100
Now consider it your
in-laws place, buddy.

766
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:25,036
Motilal has gone to inform the
police and we came here directly.

767
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,660
We tired of searching for him.

768
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,230
I wonder where the
dacoits have taken Ramdas.

769
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:32,010
Oh God! What a terrible
thing to have happen!

770
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,780
Sir, it's not the time to panic,
but to think wisely.

771
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,996
The auspicious wedding
hour is passing away.

772
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,936
Your daughter won't get a
better wedding opportunity...

773
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,910
- than this in this birth.
- So what should I do?

774
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:44,526
What should I do?

775
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,920
Marry off your daughter
to some other man.

776
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,400
Don't let this wedding occasion
slip out of your hands.

777
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,906
The girl will definitely
get trapped now.

778
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:54,210
But the people of the new
generation are present here.

779
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,290
What if they don't
listen to the priest?

780
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:59,650
I am not inexperienced, Birenath.

781
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:02,370
I've known them since childhood.

782
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,460
They won't dare to step
back from their ancient base.

783
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,680
They won't miss
this wedding opportunity.

784
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:13,790
Don't panic.

785
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,206
We've been ordered to
keep you prisoner...

786
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,730
till the wedding is solemnized.

787
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,790
Then you'll be set free, young man.

788
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,520
Till the wedding ends?

789
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,380
Then it's fantastic!

790
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,620
I myself don't want to arrive
there during the wedding.

791
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,860
But why?

792
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,090
Actually, I'm being
forced to marry this girl.

793
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:40,650
And I want to run miles away from it.

794
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,350
Really?

795
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,880
It's better our boss doesn't
come to know about it.

796
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,500
Otherwise we would
never have gotten this job.

797
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,940
Yes, chief.

798
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:53,350
You say you got this big job
because of me.

799
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,420
Of course.

800
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,180
So we're friends.

801
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,600
You saved me from this wedding
and I got work for you.

802
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,866
- Yes, it's fine.
- All right.

803
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:06,276
So, come on, shake hands, friends!

804
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,900
Let's have a feast and celebrate.

805
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,590
Release his hands.

806
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,030
- Yes, it's fine.
- It's fine.

807
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,150
What if he runs away?

808
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,360
How can I escape the clutches
of so many brave men?

809
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,320
Release him!

810
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:38,840
I'll remain a spinster all my life,
but I won't marry anyone else.

811
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:44,630
Is it the curse of the soul
of Loknath's mother?

812
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:50,390
She made me promise her
this wedding before her death.

813
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,290
Does anyone get cursed
without reason, aunt?

814
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,290
Uncle is confused by the
priest's talk there...

815
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,450
and you're talking
about being cursed here.

816
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,780
What's the use of
wasting time like this?

817
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,490
Why don't the people
go and find Ramdas?

818
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:11,710
The sea should keep flowing,
the cup of wine should be full

819
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:22,770
Host, may you and your bar prosper

820
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:43,320
I am grief-stricken,
serve me a drink

821
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:53,880
Host, please make the
withered garden bloom again

822
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:04,430
Host, show me that wonder again

823
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:14,900
Please unite me with my
estranged beloved one again

824
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:25,346
The sea should keep flowing,
the cup of wine should be full

825
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:31,700
Host, may you and your bar prosper

826
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:05,380
- Ramdas!
- Moti!

827
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,110
Are you Mr. Ramdas?

828
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:12,210
Yes. These are your culprits.
Please arrest them.

829
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,216
I don't have much time now.
I'll take your leave.

830
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,880
- Let's go, Moti.
- Go. - Wait. I'll come along too.

831
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,700
Three constables should escort us...

832
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,150
and the rest should
keep watch on these goons.

833
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,860
Come on.

834
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:32,030
- Give me wine!
- Take this wine.

835
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,380
Did you hear this news, aunt?

836
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,110
The priest is insisting...

837
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,056
that this wedding opportunity
shouldn't be missed.

838
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,300
That Nirmala should
be married to Loknath.

839
01:04:56,750 --> 01:04:58,960
As if it's not a wedding,
but a sacrifice.

840
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:02,960
This wedding will be worse
than death for Nirmala.

841
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:04,820
There's no time to think now.

842
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:09,080
If you're hesitating,
should I go and ask Mr. Loknath?

843
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,720
But priest, I have to think
about Nirmala's happiness, too.

844
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:15,540
Sir, one has to judge both the boy and
the family for one's daughter.

845
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,690
And Loknath is promising
in both respects.

846
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,400
You had verified these aspects
and chosen Loknath.

847
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:23,710
Then our daughters
become Sati under its effect.

848
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:28,520
They adapt themselves to their
husbands after their marriage.

849
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:33,740
Once married, their husband's house
becomes their heaven, their world.

850
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,720
Sir, don't miss this
wedding opportunity.

851
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,460
Otherwise you'll regret it later.

852
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,960
Does anyone gain such
an alliance easily?

853
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,650
Wait. Watch what happens.

854
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:45,370
What else will happen?

855
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:47,770
- Now Nirmala belongs to you and you...
- Belong to Nirmala.

856
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,740
- So get ready.
- You're the groom.

857
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,406
And we're the wedding guests

858
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,260
- He has come!
- The groom has come! - He's here!

859
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:58,550
- The groom has come! He's here!
- Here he is!

860
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,250
Come on, daughter-in-law.

861
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,280
Put it. Join your hands

862
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,840
Give your hand.

863
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,460
You take his hand.

864
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:08,170
Tell me, beloved

865
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:16,800
Why does the lotus bud feel
elated on watching the moon?

866
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:26,250
Tell me, beloved

867
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:35,540
Why does the sunflower
blush on watching the sun?

868
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:46,099
Tell me, beloved,
what is the reason?

869
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:54,450
- Glimpse of beloved.
- Yes. Glimpse of beloved.

870
01:08:56,350 --> 01:09:01,780
Glimpse of beloved.
Glimpse of beloved

871
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:15,220
Why does the bulbul sing
melodiously during spring?

872
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,330
What do I know?

873
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:33,020
Ask the bulbul why it sings
melodiously during spring?

874
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:43,350
The bulbul unites with his mate

875
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:58,190
Why is the garden of my
heart in full bloom today?

876
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:03,950
Why does my heart rhyme
like the tune of a lute?

877
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:10,730
- What do I know?
- Whom should I ask?

878
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:18,230
Ask your heart.

879
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:26,660
My heart says the sunflower has
made the lotus of heart blossom.

880
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:31,710
The bulbul has met his beautiful mate.

881
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:37,730
My life was lonely,
my heart forlorn.

882
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:42,820
You have enlightened
it with your love.

883
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,290
- It's dawn.
- Yes, it's the crack of dawn.

884
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,460
Have they awakened?

885
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,260
They've only just gone to sleep.

886
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:05,340
I think they spent
the whole night talking.

887
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,140
Really?

888
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,780
Yes. A new bride. New happiness.

889
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:22,840
Ten years ago a new
bride kept me awake...

890
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:24,480
the whole night talking.

891
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:27,260
Why would I have kept you awake?
You stayed awake by yourself.

892
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:29,390
I am not talking about you.

893
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,400
I'm speaking of a new,
charming, beautiful bride...

894
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,586
Aren't you ashamed to say
these things at this old age...

895
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:37,810
- And?
- Move.

896
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,340
If they're awake,
I'll serve them tea.

897
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:47,930
All right. You take tea for them.
I'll go and pick some flowers.

898
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:51,750
Yes. Madam is very fond of flowers.

899
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:56,480
I know. Anyway, many
have come and left here.

900
01:11:57,020 --> 01:12:00,800
But the way madam has
praised my flowers...

901
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,310
I was elated to hear that.

902
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,620
Niti! Niti!

903
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,960
- Will you take the flowers?
- Of course.

904
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:20,190
Then get up quickly. Otherwise
your father will do it.

905
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,760
- I will go.
- Then go. Run.

906
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,560
Your father must be picking
the flowers in the garden. Go.

907
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:36,950
Father, I'll take the flowers.

908
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,590
Here. No, I will take them.

909
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,256
Oh father, these aren't yours,
but mine.

910
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,480
They're mine.

911
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:46,830
They love me and not you.

912
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,620
Yesterday they gave me
imported sweets and toys.

913
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,200
Did you get any?

914
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:53,630
Come on, give me.

915
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:58,550
It is a very nice place.

916
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:04,360
Quiet and beautiful.
Away from the world.

917
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,350
How long have you worked here,
gardener?

918
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,210
I've been here since
arriving after marriage.

919
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,410
You never visited your native place?

920
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:14,880
This is my native
place and home, madam.

921
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,740
Sir has passed many generations here.

922
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,230
Don't you get bored
when staying here alone?

923
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,030
- We are...
- I'm first! I'm first!

924
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:25,800
Sir, I have defeated father.

925
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,880
Really?

926
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:35,390
Father said he'd bring the flowers...

927
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,480
but I snatched them from him.
Take them.

928
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,740
My darling queen.

929
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,880
Look, Niti is so cute.

930
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:48,640
Can anyone get bored in her presence?

931
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,600
Wait. Stay there.

932
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,500
Don't move.

933
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:56,670
Don't move, Niti.

934
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:08,490
Nirmala looks so beautiful
with this child.

935
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,230
A mother's form is the
true form of a woman.

936
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:21,450
She looks the most
beautiful in this form.

937
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,690
Nirmala always loved children.

938
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,170
How she used to fight with the old
gardener for the sake of children.

939
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,780
She's got a gardener's
child here too.

940
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,310
All the photographs she sent...

941
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:42,120
were taken with the gardener's family.

942
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:45,510
It seems no one else
lives in the area.

943
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,590
It's an isolated place.

944
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:52,010
Yes. They hardly receive
any newspapers or letters.

945
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:56,580
That's why I urged Ramdas' mother
to send them there.

946
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:01,040
Till Loknath's case is resolved,
they should stay there.

947
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,930
The decision of
Loknath's case is made.

948
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:08,350
Your son and daughter-in-law
will return soon.

949
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:10,650
There's nothing to worry about.

950
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:13,660
Did you hear that? Okay, bye.

951
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,670
Listen! I can't rid myself
of the fear that...

952
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,610
Loknath might put my son
into trouble again.

953
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:25,970
No, aunt. What can
Loknath do from a jail cell?

954
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,890
And after he's released?

955
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,480
Who has seen those times?

956
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,396
You're already aware that
after that detective proved...

957
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:38,440
Loknath was involved in
many other serious crimes, too...

958
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:40,830
the court sentenced
him to lengthy punishment.

959
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,220
We may never see him again.

960
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:47,670
Rest assured. Did you hear?

961
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,390
I'll really miss her.

962
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,360
Give her to me.

963
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,290
Take her, madam.

964
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,590
We'll be relieved of
the burden of her marriage.

965
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,930
Madam is very fortunate.

966
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,880
The way she is so fond of children...

967
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:05,080
God will bless her
with a child soon.

968
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,850
Son, please inform us.

969
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,310
We'll starve and come
there to have a feast.

970
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,600
Did you get leave?

971
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:09,250
No, I want to write
an important letter.

972
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,750
To whom?

973
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:14,230
The gardener.

974
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,660
Gardener?

975
01:17:17,230 --> 01:17:21,170
Yes, the gardener where we stayed
following our marriage.

976
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:24,220
Why are you writing to him?

977
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,710
Don't you remember he asked
that we inform him...

978
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,380
and he'd starve himself
and come for the feast?

979
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:34,380
So, I'm giving him the good news.

980
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:44,910
How did you come to know?

981
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,200
Pramila is Nirmala's friend.

982
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:55,610
Mr. Motilal's sister is her friend.

983
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:59,940
And Mr. Motilal is Mr. Ramdas' friend.

984
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,860
Understood?

985
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:05,840
Pramila? That witch promised me...

986
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:07,770
she wouldn't reveal the secret to anyone.

987
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:10,830
Let her come here once.
I'll scratch her face.

988
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,950
Definitely. If Pramila had been
a man instead of a woman...

989
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:19,180
I'd have helped you
do this good deed.

990
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:22,050
The boys drove me
crazy at the college today.

991
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,210
Someone called me a girl's father
while another said boy's father.

992
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,850
It's better that I leave college.

993
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:30,340
Yes, it's really nice.

994
01:18:33,690 --> 01:18:35,240
No, no. Leave it. Leave it.

995
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:39,750
No.

996
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,150
Pramila used to say
that Nirmala wants a son.

997
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,120
May God grant her wish!

998
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:49,280
Daughter-in-law. In both
Ramdas and Nirmala's...

999
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:54,290
birth chart, not just a son, but
a grandson too is indicated.

1000
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,960
- Really?
- Yes.

1001
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:00,410
If God wills, you may play with
your children and grandchildren.

1002
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:10,330
You and me and our cute son

1003
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:14,080
Our house will be like heaven

1004
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:33,980
With the sweet laughter of the son...

1005
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:37,830
our heaven will constantly echo

1006
01:19:53,610 --> 01:20:01,260
- Our son will grow up.
- He will get a sweet bride

1007
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:24,700
- With the sweet laughter of the son...
- our heaven will again echo

1008
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:47,700
- In these honeyed waves of life...
- our heaven will constantly swing

1009
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:10,820
You and me and our cute son.
Our house will be like our heaven

1010
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,310
The doctor has again
gone to have a check-up.

1011
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:34,020
Let's see what he decides.

1012
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,570
Let's pray to God.

1013
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,640
My advice is the same as before.

1014
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,230
There's no chance of
the child surviving.

1015
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:50,310
The mother might survive if
an operation is performed immediately.

1016
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,110
Tell me, should the
operation be performed?

1017
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:11,230
Why was the doctor so serious?

1018
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:19,290
What is the matter, mother?

1019
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,020
Who are you getting this ready for?

1020
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:42,870
For your grandson.

1021
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:47,740
- Alright, Nirmala...
- is expecting again.

1022
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:55,200
Alright. May God
fulfill her wishes this time!

1023
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:59,400
- But this time she's getting very scared.
- Why?

1024
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:03,850
Last time's fear is
entrenched in her heart, isn't it?

1025
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:08,310
It's been almost three
years since that happened.

1026
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,120
The effect doesn't last for so long...

1027
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:14,130
on girls who can conceive, right?

1028
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:17,560
Don't you know how much
she desires children?

1029
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:21,350
It was the poor girl's first child.

1030
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,660
And it was stillborn.

1031
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:30,240
This time her fears increase
as the days pass.

1032
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:36,500
She'll forget all her sorrows and
pain when she sees the child's face.

1033
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:42,750
May God grant my daughter
a painless delivery this time!

1034
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:56,590
Hope. How can one rely on hope?

1035
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,220
It's a wire.

1036
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:05,590
It may break again.

1037
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:09,430
It never breaks, Nirmala.

1038
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:14,190
This wire is the foundation of life.

1039
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:20,970
Why would you be given a
new life if it had to break?

1040
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:28,026
Live this life, brother. What 's
the use of getting scared, brother?

1041
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:35,790
Life is a struggle, brother.
Life is a struggle

1042
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:53,770
If you're so scared,
why did you come...

1043
01:25:54,040 --> 01:26:00,560
into the field of life, brother,
into the field of life?

1044
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:15,240
The world isn't a bed of flowers

1045
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:22,000
It is a desire with thorns, brother,
a desire with thorns

1046
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,860
Face life with courage, brother

1047
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:43,520
Life is a struggle, brother.
Life is a struggle

1048
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:58,140
The one who gets scared, dies, brother

1049
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:01,786
The one who fights, he wins, brother

1050
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:05,290
Face life with courage, brother

1051
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:11,250
Life is a struggle, brother.
Life is a struggle

1052
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,070
Give me courage.

1053
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:21,520
I won't give up hope.

1054
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:17,320
Then? My child?

1055
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:19,260
- Nirmala.
- Mother.

1056
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:21,190
Nirmala. My child.

1057
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:29,380
I had so much hope.

1058
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,000
I prayed so much.

1059
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:40,050
Then why did this happen, mother?
Why did it happen?

1060
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:10,930
From the last life there
is a curse on your mother...

1061
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:16,240
due to which your
children can't survive.

1062
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:22,840
So even this time I won't be
fated to see the face of a child?

1063
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,630
No. No. I don't believe it.
All this is wrong.

1064
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,330
Even I want that what
you say should happen.

1065
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:36,540
But what can I do?
Astrology can't be wrong.

1066
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:42,430
- Sir, isn't there any cure for this?
- It is possible.

1067
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:48,740
If he gives his mother up
or you give up your husband.

1068
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,260
No. No. All this is nonsense.
If such things were true then...

1069
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,200
the houses of the world
would have been routed.

1070
01:29:57,690 --> 01:29:58,890
Come on.

1071
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:22,250
I won't let the child die.

1072
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,500
Child.

1073
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,430
Our child.

1074
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:37,930
He is crying out for life.

1075
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:43,650
I hear his cry day and night.

1076
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,440
I am leaving... Forever.

1077
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:07,310
Won't you even say a word?

1078
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:12,240
One sweet, beautiful word?

1079
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:17,030
No. No.

1080
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:20,940
Then I won't be able to leave.

1081
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,940
The child won't be saved.

1082
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:31,980
I am leaving.

1083
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:47,610
I... am leaving.

1084
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:11,320
Give me your blessing that our
child survives, wherever he is.

1085
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:48,310
Nirmala?

1086
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:53,070
Nirmala?

1087
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:17,070
- What is it, Ramdas?
- There's no sign of Nirmala.

1088
01:35:17,230 --> 01:35:18,330
What?

1089
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:31,320
No. She didn't come here.
What are you saying?

1090
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:35,570
- Ramdas! Ramdas!
- What is it?

1091
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,510
What happened? What happened?

1092
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:40,990
Nirmala. There's no
trace of Nirmala, anywhere.

1093
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:57,100
It is possible. If he gives his mother up
or you give up your husband.

1094
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:18,440
Nirmala. Nirmala!

1095
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:19,970
Ramdas! Ramdas!

1096
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,030
And we had complete faith we'd be able...

1097
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,940
to locate her somewhere
in the city or nearby.

1098
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:45,790
But when we found this shawl
in the river entangled...

1099
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:49,270
in a stone, then we started having
various doubts in our heart.

1100
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,070
Her name is written upon it.

1101
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,590
We thoroughly scoured
the area around the river.

1102
01:36:57,310 --> 01:36:59,100
But we were unable
to locate her anywhere.

1103
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,440
Ultimately, being helpless,
we came to this conclusion.

1104
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:06,830
She lost her way in the darkness
of the storm, fell...

1105
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:11,310
into the river and was
washed away by the water's force.

1106
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,310
I have killed Nirmala.

1107
01:37:18,730 --> 01:37:21,190
If I hadn't taken her
to that astrologer...

1108
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:25,300
none of this would have happened.

1109
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,080
She looks as if she's from
a good family.

1110
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:45,240
How did she get here?

1111
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:50,080
Is she dead or alive?

1112
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:57,680
She's alive. Listen.
Can you hear me?

1113
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,440
The poor girl isn't conscious.

1114
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:18,030
Don't scare me. Nobody will
find out your secret from me.

1115
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:26,470
Alright, now we'll heat up
some milk for you.

1116
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:30,860
It will settle your stomach.
Even the child will gain strength.

1117
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,150
It's a natural occurrence

1118
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:51,970
As one departs the
other arrives, brother

1119
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:01,860
Winter, summer, drought, spring

1120
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:06,500
It is a daily procession, brother

1121
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:30,066
Face life with courage, brother

1122
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:34,580
Life is a struggle, brother

1123
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:43,750
Face life with courage, brother

1124
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:48,680
Life is a struggle, brother

1125
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:04,040
Take it. Drink it.

1126
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:12,500
- I have heard this song.
- You might have heard it.

1127
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:17,600
My father used
to sing it while begging.

1128
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:21,470
Where is your father?

1129
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:24,890
The poor man died.

1130
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:28,100
He left me alone.

1131
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:32,280
That song is my only memory of him.

1132
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:38,370
This place has become
desolate without him.

1133
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:43,830
- I don't like it here now.
- Then where will you go?

1134
01:40:45,830 --> 01:40:49,500
Ahead of this place there
is a settlement of beggars.

1135
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:55,750
Where a lot of beggars live.
I'm thinking of going there.

1136
01:40:58,380 --> 01:40:59,780
What are your plans?

1137
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:06,790
I'm also alone. I can go anywhere.

1138
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:10,670
Why don't you accompany me, alright?

1139
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:16,840
There we'll both put up
huts and live happily.

1140
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,360
They must be searching for me.

1141
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:23,710
What if they find me there?

1142
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:26,606
Who will come to look
for daughters-in-law...

1143
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:28,630
from good, well-to-do
families amongst beggars?

1144
01:41:29,230 --> 01:41:33,110
Nor do the beggars care
who comes and goes.

1145
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:37,630
You also come with me as a
beggar woman. Did you hear?

1146
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:45,620
Before now I looked after father.
Now I'll look after you.

1147
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:50,270
Both of our days will pass.
Tell me, will you come?

1148
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,420
I'll come, sister.

1149
01:41:57,150 --> 01:42:01,670
Your father had given me hope.

1150
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:09,150
It won't be strange that it
may be fulfilled in your care.

1151
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:16,180
Throw the dice again, player

1152
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:19,680
As long as there is breath,
there is hope

1153
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:24,050
Face life with courage, brother

1154
01:42:24,100 --> 01:42:28,590
Life is a struggle, brother

1155
01:42:42,450 --> 01:42:43,950
What is the occasion, today?

1156
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:46,520
Why the colorful preparations
for a dance?

1157
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:49,670
Don't you know it? A boy has
been born in our settlement. A boy.

1158
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,460
- To whom?
- That new woman named Nimmi. To her.

1159
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:56,460
Alright. Alright. Come on,
one more beggar.

1160
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
He will beg and feed. He won't
take anything away, will he?

1161
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:03,910
What else? As long as he's small,
we'll beg in his name and eat.

1162
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,290
When he grows big he
will himself beg and contribute.

1163
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:09,230
- This is the way of our world.
- Yes. Yes.

1164
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:27,260
Sister, my hope was fulfilled
under your protection.

1165
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:31,750
God, may our child live a long life!

1166
01:43:32,430 --> 01:43:34,170
My baby Krishna.

1167
01:44:21,820 --> 01:44:29,820
Yashoda, play with this child

1168
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:22,670
The small, cute baby

1169
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:27,190
The big swings the cot makes

1170
01:46:41,730 --> 01:46:43,490
Bless us that...

1171
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:49,480
our child lives...

1172
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,260
awakens.

1173
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:59,170
You stupid girl,
is this a time to cry?

1174
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:05,040
Just look outside, at the kind
of fun taking place.

1175
01:47:14,650 --> 01:47:15,750
Bindi...

1176
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:21,086
today, on my behalf,
make sure everyone...

1177
01:47:21,110 --> 01:47:23,410
eats and drinks a lot. Take this.

1178
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:34,860
What will happen with this?
Such a nice thing.

1179
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:37,620
Please give this, alright?

1180
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:43,010
No. No, Bindi. How can I give this?

1181
01:47:44,830 --> 01:47:46,440
This was from him.

1182
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:20,950
Stars are settled in both the eyes

1183
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:25,570
They fool our mind

1184
01:48:35,310 --> 01:48:37,800
The eyes are deluded

1185
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:24,890
- Well done.
- Well done.

1186
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:43,600
When the baby would
smile in his mother's lap

1187
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:48,960
And would give a sweet smile

1188
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:53,666
He would look adorable.
And just win your hearts

1189
01:49:53,690 --> 01:49:57,450
So cute and adorable

1190
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:02,430
So cute. And one of a kind

1191
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,490
Dear, apply some kohl.

1192
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:11,310
What if someone casts
an evil eye on him?

1193
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:15,490
You don't know how to raise a child.

1194
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:18,560
- Then you raise him.
- That's what will happen. Here.

1195
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:23,530
Oh! Why should I
give up my son?

1196
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:26,690
Will you go to aunty?

1197
01:50:27,210 --> 01:50:30,660
No. He is his mamma's boy.

1198
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,600
Mom and son are you going to play.

1199
01:50:38,330 --> 01:50:39,430
Right?

1200
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,860
So be it. Don't come.

1201
01:50:47,610 --> 01:50:50,830
I'll not take you along when
I go to the Sankrat fair.

1202
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:53,090
Okay, Nimmi.

1203
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,580
Everyone will go have a bath.

1204
01:50:56,850 --> 01:50:59,730
But you can't come out
before night. Poor thing.

1205
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:04,570
Anyway, I'll get water for
you and him on my way back.

1206
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:09,750
- Bindi, I'll always be indebted to you.
- Silly girl.

1207
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:15,490
Now go to sleep, son.

1208
01:51:15,930 --> 01:51:17,500
Will you go to sleep?
Look.

1209
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:45,350
Please come. Sleep. Sleep

1210
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:52,070
Why don't you come?

1211
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:59,630
And put my son to sleep

1212
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:48,060
- Ramdas.
- Yes, mother.

1213
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,520
- Are you going out?
- Yes.

1214
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:52,630
When will you return?

1215
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:56,120
Who knows? Why?

1216
01:52:57,480 --> 01:53:00,070
Son, it's Sankrant today.

1217
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:02,340
I'll observe a fast.

1218
01:53:03,010 --> 01:53:04,310
I'll worship God.

1219
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:08,270
What's the point in
wandering like this all day?

1220
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,540
You must get yourself busy.

1221
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:14,430
Come. Worship with me today.

1222
01:53:15,820 --> 01:53:16,920
Worship.

1223
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:24,380
Worship isn't meant
for sinners like me.

1224
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:27,440
I'm a murderer.

1225
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:30,050
Didn't I kill Nirmala?

1226
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:42,670
Oh Lord, will my son
never find peace?

1227
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:49,550
Will all my reverence go wasted, Lord?

1228
01:53:50,610 --> 01:53:52,660
It's the festival of Sankrat.

1229
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,580
Do some charity.

1230
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:57,060
Only the charity you
do will go with you.

1231
01:53:57,770 --> 01:53:59,860
Sir. Sir.

1232
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:07,520
You get quite a lot of alms.

1233
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:09,526
You got a child from somewhere and...

1234
01:54:09,550 --> 01:54:11,530
started begging in his name.

1235
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:14,570
I shout my lungs out all day,
but no one listens to me.

1236
01:54:15,510 --> 01:54:17,080
Won't you come?

1237
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:19,156
The bathing ritual of
Sankrant is going to happen.

1238
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:20,780
There will be plenty of charity.

1239
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:22,590
You have a child.

1240
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:24,560
You'll get plenty of alms.

1241
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:26,550
Who will give to us?

1242
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:28,430
Everyone gets what is in his destiny.

1243
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,370
Don't come. I'm going.

1244
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:40,250
If I could find a child, I'd
take him with me for a while.

1245
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:45,760
Bindi said Nimmi is sick.

1246
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:48,980
She doesn't go anywhere.

1247
01:54:52,410 --> 01:54:54,010
Let me see. She might give me.

1248
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:08,610
She's asleep.

1249
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:10,130
That's good.

1250
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:12,880
I'll take him quietly.

1251
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:31,710
I'm taking water for
Nimmi and the baby.

1252
01:55:32,410 --> 01:55:34,370
As you know, Nimmi is sick.

1253
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:36,410
She doesn't go anywhere.

1254
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:39,200
- Sir.
- Do some charity, devotees.

1255
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:40,750
- Do some charity.
- Sir.

1256
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:45,840
God bless you.

1257
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:48,490
Have mercy, master.

1258
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:50,750
- The child is hungry.
- Here.

1259
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:08,750
Nimmi. Nimmi, where is the baby?

1260
01:56:11,010 --> 01:56:12,570
- There he is.
- Where?

1261
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:14,570
Get up. Where is the baby?

1262
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:16,290
My son?

1263
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:20,736
Where is he?

1264
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,160
That's what I'm asking.

1265
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:26,380
Where did my son go?
Where did he go?

1266
01:56:27,890 --> 01:56:31,140
My son! My son!

1267
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:33,116
What happened? What happened?

1268
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:36,610
I left both of them for
a bath just a while ago.

1269
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:40,740
When I returned I saw Nimmi
sleeping and the baby gone.

1270
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:52,360
- Have you seen my baby?
- No.

1271
01:56:58,110 --> 01:56:59,690
Have you seen my baby?

1272
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:01,020
Don't worry.

1273
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:05,670
Where did my baby go?

1274
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:09,700
Son. Son!

1275
01:57:13,930 --> 01:57:15,830
Her son is dearer to her
than her own life.

1276
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,840
She'll go crazy
if she doesn't find him.

1277
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:20,960
Where can he go? Someone
must have taken him to beg.

1278
01:57:22,190 --> 01:57:23,490
He'll be found.

1279
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:25,020
Go and calm her.

1280
01:57:25,150 --> 01:57:27,230
- Have you seen my baby?
- No.

1281
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:31,690
Nimmi. Nimmi.

1282
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:36,840
- My son!
- Go away mad woman!

1283
01:57:42,640 --> 01:57:43,740
No.

1284
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:47,100
That wasn't my son.

1285
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:54,240
Where did my baby go?

1286
01:57:59,650 --> 01:58:01,310
My son.

1287
01:58:05,690 --> 01:58:07,410
My son.

1288
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:12,600
- Nimmi.
- My son.

1289
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:15,260
He'll be found.
He'll be found.

1290
01:58:17,530 --> 01:58:18,830
He'll be found.

1291
01:58:22,510 --> 01:58:23,810
He'll be found.

1292
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:28,670
Someone have mercy on the baby.

1293
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:31,330
He hasn't eaten for three days.

1294
01:58:34,450 --> 01:58:38,980
- Here.
- God bless you, sir.

1295
01:58:40,970 --> 01:58:42,720
I've never seen a
baby cry so much.

1296
01:58:43,590 --> 01:58:45,700
You don't get me as much
alms as much as you cry.

1297
01:58:46,290 --> 01:58:48,560
- Quiet. Quiet.
- Why are you beating him?

1298
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:52,830
He's crying. He can't
live without his mother.

1299
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:55,010
- This isn't your child?
- No.

1300
01:58:55,660 --> 01:58:57,060
He's my sister's child.

1301
01:58:57,270 --> 01:58:58,986
That's why you're
beating him so mercilessly.

1302
01:58:59,010 --> 01:59:01,830
- Where's your sister?
- She's dead.

1303
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:06,290
I have to raise him.

1304
01:59:06,990 --> 01:59:10,140
He's an orphan.
I have to raise him.

1305
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:12,850
So this baby's an orphan?

1306
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:14,480
Yes, an orphan.

1307
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:18,060
Give him to me. I'll raise him.

1308
01:59:19,050 --> 01:59:22,070
Who'll give me alms
if I give him to you?

1309
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:24,850
I'll die of starvation.

1310
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:27,250
Your hunger will be looked after.

1311
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:45,800
Look at this! Oh wow!

1312
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:49,380
See! Did you see this?

1313
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:53,360
You are king.
You are an emperor.

1314
01:59:53,790 --> 01:59:56,810
You never cry. You never wail.

1315
01:59:57,580 --> 02:00:00,120
And look at this.
How does it sound?

1316
02:00:00,930 --> 02:00:03,360
Tick-tick! Tick-tick! Tick-tick!

1317
02:00:10,640 --> 02:00:14,010
Where did that sound come from?

1318
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:16,150
That clock!

1319
02:00:16,350 --> 02:00:18,740
This is a watch and that is a clock.

1320
02:00:18,970 --> 02:00:20,270
It's 4 o'clock.

1321
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:23,310
Come on, let's begin the play
now. People are waiting.

1322
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:27,380
You play the king's role
and I'll be your vizier.

1323
02:00:27,980 --> 02:00:32,900
You sit here and I'll sit here.

1324
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:41,600
Lord, may my son gain
peace through this child.

1325
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:48,700
I want to see my son happy
once again before I die.

1326
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:58,250
Her name is queen sparrow.

1327
02:00:58,670 --> 02:01:00,890
She chirps melodiously.
Listen.

1328
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:04,020
Take it.

1329
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:07,910
And his name is Mr. Rattle.

1330
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:12,660
And his job is to rattle.
Understood? Take it.

1331
02:01:14,510 --> 02:01:19,620
Do you know him?
His name is Bulldog Drummond.

1332
02:01:20,130 --> 02:01:22,080
He sings melodiously.

1333
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:30,320
When you were young, I used to
cheer up while playing with you.

1334
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:32,880
You've grown up now.

1335
02:01:33,510 --> 02:01:35,450
You don't have any time
away from your work.

1336
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:39,230
So with whom should I pass my time?

1337
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:42,540
You'll definitely
have to marry this time.

1338
02:01:42,970 --> 02:01:44,360
My daughter-in-law will come.

1339
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:47,790
The house will echo with the
laughter of children again.

1340
02:01:48,410 --> 02:01:50,380
I'll be able to play my game too.

1341
02:02:08,380 --> 02:02:11,600
Huh! Munna doesn't
have the right pose.

1342
02:02:13,170 --> 02:02:14,770
How can I take the picture?

1343
02:02:20,850 --> 02:02:25,070
Look, dear, he tried thrice today...

1344
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:28,210
but he's unable to take
even one picture of Munna.

1345
02:02:29,010 --> 02:02:30,760
I took one in my first try.

1346
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:34,580
- Look! isn't this Munna's photo?
- Yes.

1347
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,240
You tell me.

1348
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:41,010
- Yes, it's his photo.
- No.

1349
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:43,250
- Then?
- It's of you.

1350
02:02:44,110 --> 02:02:45,530
- Pardon?
- Of course!

1351
02:02:46,190 --> 02:02:50,270
- Look, don't you resemble him?
- Exactly.

1352
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:57,650
While playing with Munna I
often feel I'm playing with you.

1353
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:01,670
The same nose, the same face.

1354
02:03:02,670 --> 02:03:05,750
Where was this till now?
I've never seen it.

1355
02:03:06,230 --> 02:03:09,420
No. Today when you
picked up your camera before...

1356
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:11,640
coming to the picnic here,
I remembered...

1357
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:15,390
that I used to take pictures, too.

1358
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:18,570
These fancy cameras
are available now.

1359
02:03:19,270 --> 02:03:20,880
We only had ordinary cameras then.

1360
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:23,940
But still take a look. isn't it?

1361
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:27,180
Yes.

1362
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:31,560
May you prosper.
May you flourish, sir.

1363
02:03:32,430 --> 02:03:35,050
Please feed the hungry.

1364
02:03:37,130 --> 02:03:38,230
Madam.

1365
02:03:41,020 --> 02:03:42,220
Take it.

1366
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:47,140
- Take it.
- Give it to me.

1367
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:48,600
My sister is mad.

1368
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:54,450
- Take it.
- Bless you, madam.

1369
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,200
Come on!

1370
02:04:12,750 --> 02:04:14,500
Poor ones lead such miserable lives.

1371
02:04:17,070 --> 02:04:19,080
I feel pity for that mad lady.

1372
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:21,730
Have mercy on us,

1373
02:04:22,890 --> 02:04:24,650
Sir, God will bless you.

1374
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:39,410
- What is it?
- My Munna!

1375
02:04:39,940 --> 02:04:43,400
Sister! Sister, I have found my Munna!

1376
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,790
Leave him! Leave my Munna, witch!

1377
02:04:48,050 --> 02:04:50,240
- Deceit!
- You're a cheat!

1378
02:04:54,450 --> 02:04:58,380
I was making my Munna
go to sleep in my hut...

1379
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:04,550
As soon I dozed off,
she stole him away!

1380
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:06,930
This...

1381
02:05:07,530 --> 02:05:08,830
Leave him! Leave him!

1382
02:05:08,890 --> 02:05:11,650
Nimmi, he's not your son.
Return him to them.

1383
02:05:12,190 --> 02:05:16,420
He is my Munna.
My Munna.

1384
02:05:18,290 --> 02:05:19,490
My son.

1385
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:24,240
Mad lady, it's been many
years since your son was lost.

1386
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,550
How can your son be so young?

1387
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:29,370
Give here.

1388
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:32,220
He is my son. Get back!

1389
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:35,146
Thrash this wretched lady.
Snatch the child from her!

1390
02:05:35,170 --> 02:05:38,040
No, no, sir. Let her calm down.

1391
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,020
Then I'll explain about her.

1392
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:42,440
She won't harm your child.

1393
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:48,940
She's been roaming for years,
looking for her child.

1394
02:05:50,370 --> 02:05:54,220
This poor lady abandoned her home
and family for the sake of a child.

1395
02:05:55,010 --> 02:05:57,130
Really? When? Where?

1396
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,480
A long time ago...

1397
02:06:02,710 --> 02:06:06,690
a big storm arrived one night.

1398
02:06:08,710 --> 02:06:13,550
The next day I found her lying...

1399
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:17,390
unconscious outside my hut.

1400
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:26,550
If Nirmala's shawl hadn't
been found near the riverbank...

1401
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:30,560
you couldn't have hidden your
friend from me for so many years.

1402
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:34,440
It's such a beautiful frock.

1403
02:06:37,220 --> 02:06:39,470
- Did you weave it yourself?
- Yes.

1404
02:06:46,830 --> 02:06:48,590
So, you've returned
from college now?

1405
02:06:49,110 --> 02:06:50,840
Don't keep away from your mother.

1406
02:06:51,330 --> 02:06:52,830
Don't you remember that stick?

1407
02:06:58,910 --> 02:07:00,840
It's such a deep scar.

1408
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:04,960
The boys must be teasing him
that he got it at home...

1409
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:07,250
and daughter-in-law
must have scratched him.

1410
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:27,010
Your father-in-law knows
how to do this perfectly.

1411
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:29,460
Yes, I hope I haven't forgotten how.

1412
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:43,660
Darling Munna.

1413
02:07:45,930 --> 02:07:48,450
Nirmala, do you remember?

1414
02:07:53,580 --> 02:08:01,240
- You, me and our darling son.
Our house will be like heaven

1415
02:08:17,340 --> 02:08:24,840
- The sweet laughter of Munna
- will echo in our paradise
