1
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,380
Don't you feel...

2
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:09,090
They're not going to
leave us alone... they?

3
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:17,364
Wherever we go...

4
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,462
...they will find and kills us.

5
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:25,466
Mirza...

6
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:28,102
Mirza!

7
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:22,186
I've told him many times
that I've so much money that...

8
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:24,555
...even it won't get
over. Take some of it.

9
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:26,421
But no.

10
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:28,390
The go to hell!

11
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,358
Is he dead? - No.

12
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:33,465
What?

13
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,405
Is he dead? - Now he is dead.

14
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,336
I can't see dying guys.

15
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:43,404
I can't see it.

16
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:46,483
I told him many times to
take the money offered.

17
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,230
Hello!

18
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:20,802
Hello.

19
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:29,714
But I need couple of days.

20
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:39,754
Okay.

21
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:14,791
Oh! Brother is this place Canada?

22
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:17,329
This is my shoulder.

23
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:19,464
Brother, where are you from? - Me?

24
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,832
I mean, where are you from?

25
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:25,840
I'm coming from home but
you seem to have come from Punjab.

26
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:29,371
Yeah, indeed I've come from Punjab,
but how did you know?

27
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:31,647
From the Kada (steel
wristband) on your hand.

28
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,676
In foreign countries,
with the grace our Guru...

29
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,584
...this happens to be
the only identity of Punjabis.

30
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:38,419
It's so nice, brother.
We turned out to be relatives.

31
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,120
Tell your business?

32
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:43,620
My uncle's here to receive me. I've
to call him, I don't have a phone.

33
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,690
Kindly connect me to him. - Number?

34
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
Number is, PB 6511 and 41.

35
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:53,332
I asked for the phone number,
not the Director... Telephone?

36
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:55,397
Yeah. I'd written it on a note.

37
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:59,302
It was here where it is?
Yeah, here it is.

38
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:01,168
Here it is.

39
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:03,308
You connect me please.

40
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:05,343
Here, he has noted the
entire village's numbers.

41
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:06,817
Oh! Because they all stay here.

42
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:08,576
That's it.

43
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:11,886
Here it is. - Uncle, Sati Sri Akal!

44
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,556
At least let him reply first.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,456
He's answered.

46
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,599
Uncle, Sat Sri Akal!

47
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:23,631
I am here.
I have arrived. I am here.

48
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,364
I have arrive at the Airport. Yes.

49
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,501
I've borrowed from someone.

50
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:30,609
The number is that of somebody.

51
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,573
Aunty, is fine. Perfectly fine.

52
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:34,579
Yeah, few days ago the calf died.

53
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:37,149
No, aunty had rashes and she...

54
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,239
Give it back.

55
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:40,642
Wasted my time.
Had everything to talk right now!

56
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,185
Hello! Your man is standing outside
the Airport. Come and fetch him.

57
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,190
He is standing outside,
near the parking.

58
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:51,628
If you need anything done...

59
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,824
...my uncle has big businesses
and he is very influential...

60
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,461
He is so very influential
just can't describe.

61
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:59,437
Really very highly influential.
- How high is it?

62
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:01,530
Recently my uncle bought
a plot near Naina Devi.

63
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,166
In India he is... highly
influential that you can't imagine.

64
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:07,144
Wherever he goes his name echoes.
He's well known.

65
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,646
Ok, your uncle's name
echoes but right now...

66
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:10,706
That's right,
from where do I go out?

67
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:12,545
Straight. - This way?

68
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:13,808
Good by, brother.

69
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:22,388
Hey, hi!
Hi! Hello, dear nephew! Hi, hi!

70
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:25,158
Uncle! - Welcome, welcome, well...

71
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:26,457
Uncle, my respects.

72
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:29,896
Uncle! Just a minute.

73
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:33,365
Hold on for a moment.

74
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,166
Just a minute. Here take this.

75
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:36,769
Oh, wow, wonderful!

76
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,834
Hey, uncle! Uncle!

77
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:43,880
I brought it especially from
Punjab. Yeah, hold on for a moment.

78
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,310
Just a minute, uncle.

79
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:47,610
Now you return the gesture too.

80
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:49,882
Uncle, return the favor.
Put this around my neck too.

81
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,526
I'm here in Canada.
- Welcome to Canada.

82
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:55,856
How was the journey?

83
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,656
Uncle, you're speaking
English that's fine but...

84
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,563
...I don't understand
what are you saying.

85
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:06,135
I mean to say how was your journey?

86
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:09,504
Oh, journey!
Journey was very unpleasant.

87
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,166
As the roads pot ridden.
- Yeah, yeah.

88
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:13,144
And after that I did
not even realized. - Yeah.

89
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:15,374
You know, when I embarked
on the plane at Delhi...

90
00:12:15,882 --> 00:12:19,215
...I immediately took out
the bottle of native booze...

91
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:21,252
...I gulped down two large pegs.

92
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:23,753
And before the plane could
take off, then took drink took off.

93
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:26,353
Then what, I just slept in stupor.

94
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:30,494
By the time I was sober,
Hostesses said it's Canada.

95
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:33,262
Good. Good. Well, well.

96
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:35,490
Uncle! Call the driver. Let's go.

97
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,794
Driving no. I don't like.

98
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,236
I don't like small vehicles.

99
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,570
Big vehicles... Look there.

100
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,541
Sky train, a big vehicle.
- Oh, beg vehicle.

101
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:48,643
Now you've also got big vehicles?
You ply big vehicles too?

102
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:52,183
Wow, you've also put
big vehicles to run. Amazing!

103
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:54,816
You've have really advanced well.
Ok, uncle. Let's go.

104
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:57,850
I am really hungry, let's go.
- Oh, you mean food? - Yeah.

105
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:00,392
Okay. Okay.
We'll go. - Then let's go.

106
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:05,625
Okay. You see...
I see... Let's go this way.

107
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:08,392
Yeah, uncle let's go.
I'll try my hands at driving too.

108
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:12,300
Do they walk here in this manner?
Okay, okay. Then I'll walk that way.

109
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:17,208
Excuse me.
Somebody would like to see you.

110
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:26,583
It's been a while.

111
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:30,419
By the look on your face,

112
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:33,149
I can tell you remember me.

113
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,759
You know why you're here?

114
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:38,829
Last time you were in town...

115
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:40,564
Two years ago.

116
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:45,203
As I was saying...

117
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:49,130
Last time you were in town,
2 well connected men were shot.

118
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:51,202
Namely Terrence and Polly.

119
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,677
Not that I am happy about that.

120
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:58,617
Oh, we don't need some vigilante
going around town doing job for us.

121
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,822
I know what you are. A mercenary.

122
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:08,826
A gun for hire...
and nothing more than that.

123
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:19,368
And one can be
charged for anything?

124
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,535
If not, I'd like to go home.

125
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:40,781
Let him go.

126
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,539
Where is Param?

127
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:07,516
Param is with Deesha, in his club.

128
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,155
Now at home nobody
will talk talk of business.

129
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:12,484
Sahiba is coming home.

130
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,860
Whatever we do,
I don't want her to know.

131
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:19,253
Four containers landed last night.
Are they checked?

132
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:20,458
We will do that.

133
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:22,734
All right then send
them to their destinations.

134
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,599
That I will do.
- I will go now. - Ok.

135
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:45,346
What the hell...

136
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,627
Wow, Mirza, you!
You landed a day early, buddy?

137
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:53,687
Keys.

138
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,472
I was sad to hear
about your brother.

139
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:04,400
It was so sad.

140
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:08,207
The same good old story.
No one is ready to say anything.

141
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:10,674
I enquired with people, everyone
said they didn't see anything.

142
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,147
How is it possible?

143
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,245
Even the police are saying...

144
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,220
'He's in the wrong
place at the wrong time.'

145
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:17,319
Thank you.

146
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,585
It's parked outside
behind those trucks.

147
00:17:12,678 --> 00:17:13,667
Mirza!

148
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:16,570
Mirza!

149
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:21,449
I am so happy to see you.

150
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,189
I am so glad you're back.

151
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:34,628
I'm yearning to see my daughters.
And days are pleasant too.

152
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:37,736
Daddy! - Oh, my princess is here!

153
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:39,695
My, princess.

154
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:40,670
Mummy!

155
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,640
I'm so proud of you, my child.

156
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:46,771
Whenever you come this
house fills with happiness.

157
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,712
So sweet. So sweet.

158
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,207
Love you, dear. - I love you too.

159
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,318
Mummy! - Oh, my daughter is home.

160
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:56,184
Today, is the most happy day.
- Mom, looking good. - Thank you.

161
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:57,745
Sahiba!

162
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:01,625
Yes, my brother. - How are you?

163
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:03,660
I am fine. And you? - I'm good.

164
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:05,660
Hey, come on!
Come on! - Good to see you, sis.

165
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:06,789
Good to see you.

166
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:09,323
Kabi!

167
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:10,624
Hallo!

168
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:12,593
Kabi!

169
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:16,330
How're you?

170
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:18,704
Why're you dressed in black?

171
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,346
He likes it. Black.

172
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:26,217
After the death of
mom daddy was so upset...

173
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:29,082
...that left the house
and moved to farmhouse.

174
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:30,377
Come in.

175
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:43,867
How many days you're here for?

176
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,164
I don't know.

177
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:51,867
Why have you come?

178
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:00,716
What was the hurry, dad?

179
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:03,187
Couldn't you have waited?

180
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:05,687
He was my brother after all.
At least you could have called me.

181
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:16,201
Do you think, we did not try?

182
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,794
How were we to know where
you live and what you do.

183
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:24,273
Also the mother
who gave you birth...

184
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,704
...you could hardly
attend her funeral.

185
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,772
I still fail to understand...

186
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:06,443
...what was the need for
Amar to write about this gang.

187
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,449
Police say...

188
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:15,220
'Amar was at wrong
place at wrong time.'

189
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:26,904
So, Sahiba.
What'd you like for your birthday?

190
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,603
It wouldn't be a surprise
if I tell you?

191
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:32,507
Come on, Sahiba!
Tell us.

192
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:35,338
You know, what they say?

193
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:37,748
Speak.
- It is said...

194
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,441
It is revealed from the
gift of a person gives...

195
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:43,214
...that what he thinks about you
and how well he knows you.

196
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:44,714
I don't know.

197
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:46,890
Come on, now tell me

198
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:56,259
I was sure, I'd find you here.

199
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:01,128
Whenever you are upset,
you always come here.

200
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:05,365
Look.

201
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:09,543
Whatever you do...

202
00:21:11,116 --> 00:21:13,550
I understand that you have
some compulsions.

203
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:18,382
Alas, if my dad understood that.

204
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:20,152
Mirza, you know dad.

205
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:24,321
He's just... He is upset right now.
He'll be okay.

206
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:29,698
I won't ask you...

207
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:34,404
...where do you live,
what do you do.

208
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,405
You just did.

209
00:21:42,214 --> 00:21:44,182
So how long will you be
staying here?

210
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,143
Deepi, may I tell you something?

211
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:47,880
You'd have been a
good lawyer too.

212
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,847
Perhaps, a doctor as well.

213
00:21:56,228 --> 00:21:57,889
Deepi, tell me one thing.
- Yes?

214
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:01,597
In last few days...

215
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:04,826
...was there any changes
in Amar's behavior?

216
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:08,837
Something which was abnormal
or out of ordinary?

217
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:11,837
Stop it please.

218
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:15,271
I know what's going on
in your mind.

219
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,547
Everyone knows...

220
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,618
...that Amar's death was
an accident.

221
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:29,319
He was just at the wrong place...

222
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:31,895
...at the wrong time.

223
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:37,763
You please don't take any
wrong step.

224
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:40,566
We don't wanna lose you.

225
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:45,867
I'm going to the city tomorrow.

226
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:14,796
Frank, my man...

227
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,131
Always on time.

228
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,565
Hey, baby!

229
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:40,589
See you next week.

230
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:42,820
See you next week, chief!

231
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:55,896
Okay? Okay.

232
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:58,535
Big money.

233
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:01,769
Yeah, be careful.
Lest you're robbed.

234
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:09,843
I will leave.

235
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,190
Tony is waiting for me
at the front.

236
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,192
Leave from rear, it's safe.

237
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:20,192
Bring the car at the back alley.

238
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:30,635
At least count it once.

239
00:25:31,243 --> 00:25:32,471
Should be fine.

240
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:36,375
As you wish.
Our responsibility is over.

241
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:38,629
Let's get him inside.

242
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:06,456
I'll go now.

243
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:10,427
Sit. Sit down.

244
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,137
Who were they?

245
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:18,565
No idea.

246
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:21,545
Haven't you seen ever?

247
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:25,211
He was new.
Came looking for job.

248
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:27,707
What work?

249
00:28:32,157 --> 00:28:35,684
Some odd job men... any.

250
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:40,664
Can we trust the,?

251
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:47,204
Did not you hear?

252
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:57,847
Drop him to the gate.
- It's okay.

253
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:00,141
I will mange.

254
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,479
Call Disha.

255
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:03,178
Don't call me a thief.

256
00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:12,889
Sometimes, during the night,
I drop by to see beautiful girls.

257
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:18,193
But I was here to drop
your brother.

258
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:36,330
It's not so easy...

259
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:38,699
...as I thought it to be.

260
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:43,910
Hail the Sage of kicks.

261
00:31:44,216 --> 00:31:46,150
Hail the Sage of kicks.

262
00:31:46,218 --> 00:31:48,277
Hail the Sage of kicks.

263
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:49,852
What are you doing?

264
00:31:51,823 --> 00:31:54,257
Can't you see, we are paying
our respects, what else?

265
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,451
Myself, Bahadur Singh.

266
00:31:57,829 --> 00:31:59,626
Ex-serviceman, Corporal.

267
00:31:59,798 --> 00:32:02,096
Then I'm... Diler Singh.

268
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,563
In std. 10th I was in NCC.

269
00:32:04,736 --> 00:32:08,536
My entire clan was engaged
in tightening the security.

270
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:11,699
My clan's stories are numerous.
My grandfather...

271
00:32:12,143 --> 00:32:14,771
My grandfather was such
a great martyr...

272
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:17,775
He was such a great martyr,
such a great...

273
00:32:17,882 --> 00:32:20,373
He was so much great...
- How great?

274
00:32:20,518 --> 00:32:22,543
He martyred at the age of 105.
- Oh!

275
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:24,153
Initially he wasn't ready
to martyr.

276
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:26,247
Ultimately entire family went
and requested him...

277
00:32:26,324 --> 00:32:27,791
...kindly be useful to the nation,
now you have grown so old.

278
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,850
Immediately my grandfather vowed.

279
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:33,161
He got up early next morning.
Took the pot in his hands...

280
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:34,727
...he was going to relieve himself.

281
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,428
He was there then an Air force
jet plane passed by... zoom...

282
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:40,668
Then?
And here my grandpa passed away.

283
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:44,201
That's it. Thinking it to be a
enemy plane he fainted.

284
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:46,643
That's all. And he martyred.

285
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:48,440
This is called gallantry.

286
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:52,374
So to speak my entire clan
has been that of martyrs.

287
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,677
They were highly skillful
shooters...

288
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,547
I will tell you a story.

289
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:59,179
There was war with Baristan.
And I was at the border.

290
00:32:59,591 --> 00:33:01,684
I captured 20 guys
of Baristan.

291
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,124
I put them in a line.
- Listen! - I said...

292
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:09,132
Hey, now I am going to
kill you horribly.

293
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,567
I lifted the gun fired it.

294
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:14,398
First bullet entered from
here and came out from there.

295
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:17,199
Then it entered the second
guy and came out the other way.

296
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:19,775
Third guy got the bullet
this way...

297
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:22,136
...and it went out the other way.
Hello! Uncle, tell me...

298
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,148
...were you shooting or
provide cable connection?

299
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:26,580
What's it, it entered this way,
came out the other? Strange.

300
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:29,812
At least talk something
which can be digested.

301
00:33:30,588 --> 00:33:33,523
Brother, you must have realized
by now, that how great...

302
00:33:33,658 --> 00:33:37,321
...shooters we are and how
dangerous guys we are.

303
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:40,896
Your question is very ridiculous.
Highly ridiculous.

304
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:44,532
People become speechless
when they here about us.

305
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:49,437
Uncle, should I reveal to him
my incidence of Moga city...

306
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:52,904
Kid, no. Don't tell him
the incidence of Moga.

307
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,405
Poor fellow will get depression
for nothing.

308
00:33:57,215 --> 00:33:59,513
He is in depression now.
- Haven't you?

309
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:01,809
All right, it's enough talks now.

310
00:34:02,187 --> 00:34:04,212
You guys get to work.

311
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:08,157
All right.
- Yah work is work after all.

312
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:10,250
Don't know from where drop in!

313
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:15,129
In the dark nights...

314
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,733
On the lonely paths...

315
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:22,204
To end every crime...

316
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,532
A prophet come out...

317
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:30,146
Whom they call Diler Singh,
Diler Singh

318
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:35,251
Such desolation!

319
00:34:36,688 --> 00:34:39,122
There is nothing here Diler Singh,
it's your imagination.

320
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:40,813
Nothing.

321
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:46,421
Seems there is something
but is it my hallucination?

322
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:50,362
Hello, there!
Here he is!

323
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,407
Ghost. Oh, ghost.

324
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:07,274
Yeah, it's a ghost.
A ghost.

325
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:10,843
Cool down.

326
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,287
Ghost... Who... who is it?

327
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:19,660
Who is it?
Ghost?

328
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:23,132
Who is it?

329
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:25,859
I... I am gonna hit you
with my shoes.

330
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:29,437
Who are you? Who?

331
00:35:32,177 --> 00:35:34,737
Hey, what's wrong?
Madho Singh! Madho Singh!

332
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:37,714
What happened. Madho Singh!
What are you doing?

333
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:40,148
There is a ghost.
- Come on, we'll see.

334
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,583
Hey, come let's find out.

335
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:45,179
What happened.
Hey, come along. It's nothing.

336
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,822
Hey, come let's find out.

337
00:35:49,394 --> 00:35:52,227
There is a ghost there.
- Here look at him.

338
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,162
Ghost! Ghost!

339
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,389
Ghost!

340
00:35:57,402 --> 00:35:58,460
He is ghost.

341
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,398
Uncle and nephew.

342
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:05,598
Uncle and nephew. Yeah?
Are you all right now.

343
00:36:06,077 --> 00:36:07,544
You're okay now?
Ok, come along.

344
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,440
All right? - A ghost.
- It's nothing like that.

345
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:15,280
It's nothing here.
Everything is fine. Everything.

346
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,650
Come take a walk and see.
Let's walk a bit.

347
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:20,589
Both of you try and walk.
You'll be fine. Just do that.

348
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:24,524
Come on, go.
Had enough of a job.

349
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,118
Oh!
- Oh, shit.

350
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,479
Its okay, I will manage.
- It's I'll take care of it.

351
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:52,887
Thanks.
- No problem.

352
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:55,348
Wow!

353
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:58,854
You were... that night...
at my place?

354
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:01,693
It's a beautiful picture.

355
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,158
Yeah.
- Yeah.

356
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:07,771
Hi!
- Hello!

357
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:13,268
But why do I feel that
I have met you earlier.

358
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:25,383
You were at Art Gallery...

359
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:29,284
Yeah. Why, can't I be there?

360
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:31,257
Am I banned there?
- No.

361
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:33,421
You don't appear to be
Art Gallery type.

362
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:37,092
I am of lots of types, what to
tell you. - No, it's not that.

363
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,108
Thank you.

364
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:11,325
How do I tell you...

365
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:14,467
...that what have in mind
about us.

366
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:15,795
Now...

367
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:18,537
How come I leave you alone.

368
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:05,141
Seems you're the one who
saved brother Jeet's life.

369
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:07,540
Mack.

370
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:09,608
Mirza.

371
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:18,558
Meet my brothers.

372
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:20,721
You've already met him.

373
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:22,892
This is Mack.

374
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:24,894
Astrologer of our family.

375
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:27,737
He is...
- I'm Nabi.

376
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:29,595
I'm Param.

377
00:40:29,874 --> 00:40:31,432
What job are you looking for?

378
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,734
From where?

379
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:37,210
Less work... - Not more.
- More money.

380
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:42,178
As we've met, you'll go far.

381
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:45,616
Listen.
Thanks for the last night.

382
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,789
That's okay.
No problem.

383
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:50,926
You are a nice guy.

384
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:53,493
Meet me at the club at 10.

385
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:55,755
Should I drop you?
- No, thanks.

386
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:58,190
I'll leave.

387
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:03,835
Call Frank and enquire
about him.

388
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:31,733
Okay tell me.
What do you see in his eyes.

389
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:37,536
I reminds me of my
grandma's saying.

390
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,643
She always used to tell me,
whoever is around you...

391
00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:45,747
...good, bad...

392
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:48,915
...big or small.

393
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:51,853
It's all is a game of Lord.

394
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,421
Just the need is for you
to understand.

395
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,449
Nice.

396
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,393
So what God saying
through this picture?

397
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,861
That I'm the luckiest person
in the world...

398
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:12,165
...standing here looking at
the picture...

399
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,801
...I could have been in
his shoes too.

400
00:42:17,114 --> 00:42:19,446
God know, what problems
he must have faced.

401
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:27,116
I had told you earlier too.

402
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:29,284
You really don't look like
Art Gallery type.

403
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:34,865
Ok, tell me. What are you doing
in the closed Art Gallery.

404
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:38,698
I thought of stealing
your pictures.

405
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,832
Oh?
Okay.

406
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:44,674
I came to know that today...

407
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:47,871
...it's exhibition of your painting.
Thought you didn't invite me...

408
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,613
I thought of wishing you good luck.

409
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:52,738
Thank you.

410
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:55,743
Even now I can't put
my finger on it.

411
00:42:56,153 --> 00:42:59,145
But I know that I know
you from somewhere.

412
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,690
Strain your brain a bit...

413
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:05,626
...gradually you'll recall.

414
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:09,622
Okay.

415
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:29,513
Yeah.
Yeah, Frank.

416
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:36,125
Yeah.
Yes, Frank.

417
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:39,321
Yeah, fine. I'll have all
other boys come around. Ok.

418
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:43,259
What happened?

419
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:45,892
This Frank guy is very greedy.

420
00:43:46,704 --> 00:43:48,399
However much he gets,
it's still less.

421
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:50,266
What's the opinion about Mirza?

422
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:52,703
He is a troubled kid.

423
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:55,340
He's been to prison three times.

424
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,377
I think, we can trust him.

425
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:18,123
Come on.

426
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:33,106
Oh. So this is the guy, huh?

427
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:35,584
Who turned Chinese into
butter-chicken, yeah?

428
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,190
Grab a drink.
Come we have to talk business.

429
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:43,158
Come, let's go.

430
00:44:57,308 --> 00:44:58,673
Find out who're those Chinese.

431
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:00,173
Who are backing them?

432
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:03,077
These new kids, would
reach me.

433
00:45:15,693 --> 00:45:16,785
Damn them rascals.

434
00:45:18,095 --> 00:45:20,461
Find them out... and kill them.

435
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:24,593
It's found that all those
guys used to came to the club.

436
00:45:25,736 --> 00:45:27,101
But they can't be from here.

437
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:28,127
No.

438
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:29,567
They all are outsiders.

439
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:51,850
Damn you!

440
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:56,524
Boss, there's guy in the back alley
hammering couple of chinks.

441
00:45:57,568 --> 00:45:59,160
Go and see what's happening.

442
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:09,772
Oh, damn!

443
00:46:10,114 --> 00:46:12,105
Oh, it's a fight.
Some Chinese guy.

444
00:46:14,351 --> 00:46:16,319
Hey, Mirza.
What are you doing?

445
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,755
Buddy, the fellow has had it.
- Let him have more!

446
00:46:25,596 --> 00:46:28,190
Let him be!
Rascal!

447
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,192
What are you doing, man?

448
00:46:31,469 --> 00:46:33,494
He just needs excuse to
bash a fellow.

449
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:36,202
Hey... You don't speak English now?

450
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:39,102
Now you've forgotten English!

451
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:42,737
Both are out!
- Seems he's gone mad.

452
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:45,106
Are you out of your mind, Mirza?

453
00:46:48,285 --> 00:46:50,480
He is one of those who
cornered Jeet yesterday.

454
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:59,652
Hey, let him go!
Don't beat him up!

455
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:07,136
Here take it, wipe your
hands clean.

456
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:13,306
From today he will work for us.

457
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:14,600
Good.

458
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:23,349
Mom, don't worry about him. I
and Kabi have arranged everything.

459
00:47:24,088 --> 00:47:26,648
Ok, I'll hang up now.
Shall talk later. My respects.

460
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:38,096
Rascal has lost his mind.

461
00:47:38,135 --> 00:47:41,502
I swear upon my children,
it will never happen again.

462
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:47,810
I expected it from you.

463
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:50,112
Did not you even think once?

464
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:51,840
And also you?

465
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:55,848
Go and sit outside. Come.
- Go out.

466
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:02,057
You too go out.

467
00:48:14,505 --> 00:48:16,132
Don't hit so much, buddy.

468
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,831
Let those poor fellow off.

469
00:48:34,658 --> 00:48:37,718
Whatever we do here,
we'll have to suffer for it.

470
00:48:38,162 --> 00:48:40,630
Mack, go and tell this tale
to oldies in Punjab.

471
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:43,630
Stick is a prophet for
unruly guys.

472
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:46,201
How many kids Nikku has?

473
00:48:46,503 --> 00:48:48,664
Two sons and a daughter.

474
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:50,831
Send him a hundred thousand
dollars.

475
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:52,741
And keep sending every year...

476
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:54,776
...till the kids come of age.

477
00:48:55,479 --> 00:48:58,380
What about the others?
- Do what you like.

478
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,583
Are preparations over
for tomorrow.

479
00:49:01,652 --> 00:49:03,677
Yes, everybody knows whose
function is tomorrow.

480
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,052
We shall leave no shortcomings.

481
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,456
Tomorrow it's Sahiba's birthday.

482
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:12,593
You ready?
- Of course.

483
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:18,665
Nabi you're here?
Where is Deesha?

484
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,431
Deesha?
He kills dead.

485
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:24,596
He kills dead.

486
00:49:25,075 --> 00:49:27,168
When I was a little kid.

487
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:31,445
I was very naughty.

488
00:49:32,316 --> 00:49:35,649
My stealing was caught.

489
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:01,644
Hey! This could be interesting.

490
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:09,345
Priety, you wait here.

491
00:50:10,254 --> 00:50:11,380
I'll be back.

492
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:24,666
You look beautiful.

493
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:27,759
Thank you.

494
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:32,700
One day I will take you far
from all this.

495
00:50:33,877 --> 00:50:35,208
Sorry... what was that?

496
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:38,308
Did you say something?
- Uh, I say your dress is beautiful.

497
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:42,143
Isn't it the most beautiful dress
you have ever seen?

498
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:45,583
Dress!
- What?

499
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:48,188
Have you ever seen such
beautiful dress?

500
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,221
Yeah. I've seen very much
prettier dresses.

501
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:56,264
But I haven't seen any beautiful
girl in such a pretty dress.

502
00:51:01,238 --> 00:51:03,365
Hello! Hello! Hello!

503
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:05,304
Hello!
- My greetings.

504
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:07,333
I have to say something to you.

505
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:09,469
What? - I want you tell you...
Hey, who's interfered now.

506
00:51:09,546 --> 00:51:14,506
Beautiful. Very much.
I mean, very bright.

507
00:51:14,651 --> 00:51:17,381
Damn his beautiful!
He finds her beautiful?

508
00:51:17,855 --> 00:51:20,289
Mirza!
- Fatso.

509
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:22,755
She may be beautiful to him.
- To me she seems like you.

510
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:25,457
Mirza, don't you dare.

511
00:51:26,263 --> 00:51:27,821
Gorgeous!
You look gorgeous!

512
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:29,324
A cracker!

513
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,131
Oh... Gorgeous. He's calling
her honey gorgeous.

514
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:35,466
Sweet.
All right, she's gorgeous?

515
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:37,439
Mirza! Behave!

516
00:51:38,642 --> 00:51:40,269
You just ask me once.

517
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:43,373
She is quiet fat, but yes.
- 10 Kilos.

518
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:47,344
Wow, I swear. You aren't aware
but you are so beautiful...

519
00:51:47,518 --> 00:51:49,850
Excuse me... Madam.

520
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:52,177
Mirza...

521
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:54,415
You look lovely, madam.

522
00:51:54,558 --> 00:51:55,582
Nice dress.

523
00:51:55,859 --> 00:52:00,296
Thank you. - From where has he
popped in. Thank you. So sweet!

524
00:52:00,497 --> 00:52:02,158
Now, guys are zealous.

525
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:04,527
You are too much.

526
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:06,697
Really too much.

527
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:09,271
Hey princess come here.

528
00:52:09,873 --> 00:52:10,862
Oh...

529
00:52:12,176 --> 00:52:13,165
Too much.

530
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:15,233
Really!

531
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:17,436
To much.

532
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:21,380
So, we were talking about marriage.
- Yes.

533
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:25,684
Yes. - Really? Should I take
it as your yes for marriage?

534
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:29,315
Look at this... with all my
heart it's my request.

535
00:52:31,595 --> 00:52:34,758
Said it again.
You're beautiful. A cracker.

536
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:36,629
So you're gorgeous!

537
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:38,598
Yes?
Isn't it, yes then?

538
00:52:39,203 --> 00:52:41,501
Wow! O God, I am...

539
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:44,502
I say, why do you waste it,
it'd be useful for someone else.

540
00:52:44,575 --> 00:52:46,805
Can't he look at his face!
Wanna to propose me!

541
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:50,136
Is that so!
Does this mean I was wrong?

542
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:53,510
It's my fault.

543
00:52:54,418 --> 00:52:57,910
Had I narrated to her my Moga's
incidence...

544
00:52:58,222 --> 00:52:59,450
she'd have agreed at once.

545
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:01,682
Never mind.

546
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,288
There are many in the party.

547
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:08,154
Oh, I am...

548
00:53:08,732 --> 00:53:09,721
Oh, I see.

549
00:54:25,876 --> 00:54:28,401
Hey, Sahiba. - Hi, Vishal.
Happy birthday.

550
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:32,609
I was looking for you all over.
Asking everyone where you are.

551
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:35,880
I looked everywhere.
- I was there, with Preetie.

552
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:38,485
This is...
Look, what I got for you, .

553
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:40,583
Oh, thank you.

554
00:54:41,224 --> 00:54:42,623
I immediately went to buy it.

555
00:54:42,826 --> 00:54:45,693
I should have understood.
It's for Sahiba.

556
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:49,596
When I say, he gets angry.
But what effect it has on us.

557
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,892
Deesha stands there and
lights up the fire, tell him

558
00:54:52,169 --> 00:54:53,659
Buying a gift for Sahiba,
is it a joke?

559
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:55,695
Open now.
Open now, baby.

560
00:54:55,872 --> 00:54:57,339
I'll open it later.

561
00:54:57,541 --> 00:55:00,169
Come on! Open it up, Sahiba.
Please.

562
00:55:00,377 --> 00:55:03,073
Deesha I'll open them all at once.
- Come on. Open up for me.

563
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:06,408
It's very costly.

564
00:55:07,317 --> 00:55:09,808
I know you'll like it.
You'll go crazy seeing it.

565
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:16,250
You like it?

566
00:55:17,127 --> 00:55:19,527
It's beautiful.
- Oh, here it is.

567
00:55:19,696 --> 00:55:21,596
I know everything of
your likes and dislikes.

568
00:55:21,765 --> 00:55:23,096
She loves me.

569
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,530
Love me too much.
I love you.

570
00:56:48,652 --> 00:56:51,246
Come on, hurry up.
I don't have whole day.

571
00:56:53,156 --> 00:56:55,147
Making sure Jeet,
it's making sure.

572
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:58,490
Come on, you know
I want the best for you.

573
00:56:59,663 --> 00:57:01,221
Just don't wanna ruin
my reputation?

574
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,827
You know I don't give
this to anybody else.

575
00:57:23,386 --> 00:57:24,751
What's that Gordon?

576
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:29,383
Why you're making her do that?

577
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:31,420
You are... Oh!

578
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:36,526
Come on, deal is done.

579
00:57:37,134 --> 00:57:38,692
Oh! Really it's deal?

580
00:57:42,439 --> 00:57:43,770
Nice belt, Gordon.

581
00:57:44,808 --> 00:57:45,797
Nice belt.

582
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:48,538
Yeah, it's good.
- Nice belt.

583
00:57:49,246 --> 00:57:50,611
Is this part of the deal?

584
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:52,877
Yeah, it is for sale man,

585
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:54,844
Yeah, sure. I will pay for it.

586
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:57,242
I'll pay for it, Gordon.

587
00:57:58,288 --> 00:57:59,550
Thank you. I will pay for it.

588
00:58:00,357 --> 00:58:01,654
Jeet!
- Now you'll pay for it.

589
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:03,522
Jeet!
Now you'll pay for it.

590
00:58:03,693 --> 00:58:04,682

Nice belt.

592
00:58:08,265 --> 00:58:10,062

593
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:13,600
Jeet! Jeet!

594
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:16,795
Nice...

595
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:19,539
Leave me.
- Let's go Jeet.

596
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,588
What have you done?

597
00:58:40,697 --> 00:58:43,097
It was not right.
- What wasn't right?

598
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:45,732
The bloody fool...

599
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:48,499
As is, she is pregnant.

600
00:58:49,372 --> 00:58:51,101
And on top, he is giving
cocaine to her.

601
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:54,437
Are you joking? What's the
difference between you and him?

602
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:56,407
Your stuff too sells there.

603
00:58:58,582 --> 00:59:01,142
There is a difference.
A lot of difference.

604
00:59:03,153 --> 00:59:05,053
To those who I sell,
they have their choice.

605
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,420
But the poor thing which
is in womb...

606
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:10,321
...he has no choice.

607
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:11,816
Got it.

608
00:59:31,615 --> 00:59:34,106
At least wash your hands too
sometimes like you bald head.

609
00:59:34,451 --> 00:59:37,079
Damn you!
You'd wash your hands sometime.

610
00:59:37,687 --> 00:59:38,676
See.

611
00:59:39,422 --> 00:59:42,084
See he is here. Your friend.
- Hey, hi! How are you.

612
00:59:42,158 --> 00:59:45,127
Hey, baldy. What kind of job
you do...

613
00:59:45,495 --> 00:59:47,122
...that all that lines on your
palms have vanished.

614
00:59:47,163 --> 00:59:49,495
Come on, Mac.
Don't you've any other business?

615
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,460
Do some good deed too.

616
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:54,195
You are right.
- Ok, Mirza, let me read you palm.

617
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:57,872
My palm?
I don't believe in such things.

618
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:05,111
Fried, what's her name?
- Whose?

619
01:00:05,282 --> 01:00:08,615
The same beautiful girl
with whom you're in love.

620
01:00:09,286 --> 01:00:11,880
Love and in our line of business?
It's only mater of talk, Mac.

621
01:00:13,223 --> 01:00:16,750
You know what? Many things in life
happens even if you don't wish.

622
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,852
You do no that, don't you?

623
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:21,626
Your lines do reveal this.

624
01:00:22,165 --> 01:00:24,133
Oh, so what more do they say.

625
01:00:27,337 --> 01:00:28,326
Mirza!

626
01:00:29,873 --> 01:00:30,862
Yes, Jeet.

627
01:00:31,574 --> 01:00:32,563
Come up.

628
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:34,499
Coming.

629
01:00:40,717 --> 01:00:43,277
I am getting calls from Tom.
Have you done his job or not?

630
01:00:43,486 --> 01:00:44,919
It will be done today for sure.

631
01:00:46,389 --> 01:00:48,186
Pop over to Deesha and
grab the bag.

632
01:00:48,258 --> 01:00:49,623
Then let him do what he likes.

633
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:09,108
Master!

634
01:01:12,816 --> 01:01:14,579
We need the bouncer's job, sir.

635
01:01:14,718 --> 01:01:16,743
We're very useful guys.

636
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,714
He is my uncle.

637
01:01:20,423 --> 01:01:22,323
Tahal Singh Takkar.

638
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:25,294
And this servant of your
is called...

639
01:01:25,595 --> 01:01:26,584
Gogga!

640
01:01:27,397 --> 01:01:29,592
Sir, they call me Gogga the Fist.

641
01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:35,431
In Punjab my uncle's
business is of fruits.

642
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:37,370
Have Mango farms.

643
01:01:38,141 --> 01:01:40,268
I butt my head and
mangos fall.

644
01:01:40,477 --> 01:01:41,842
This nothing, sir.

645
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:45,573
There was gang after me,
all of fifty of them.

646
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:50,477
On on hand those entire 50
and on the other I was alone.

647
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:53,186
What happened then?
- What was to happen?

648
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:55,187
They stood there and
I stood at my side.

649
01:01:55,692 --> 01:01:56,852
I mean, sir...

650
01:01:57,193 --> 01:01:59,821
All fifty of them had guns.

651
01:02:00,563 --> 01:02:03,794
But luckily, that day I had
a chopper.

652
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:06,093
Then what more, sir.

653
01:02:06,803 --> 01:02:08,270
I got very angry.

654
01:02:08,872 --> 01:02:14,401
I with that chopper, chopped
of all the legs and put them aside...

655
01:02:14,477 --> 01:02:17,640
...and I asked them to recognize
their legs and take them away.

656
01:02:18,615 --> 01:02:21,607
Nephew, why did not you
chop off their heads.

657
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:25,218
Uncle! Actually someone
had already done that.

658
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:30,555
So, do we take our job
is final.

659
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:33,684
I feel...

660
01:02:34,297 --> 01:02:36,162
...junior, whether you're
scared?

661
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:39,335
Are you feeling giddy, son?

662
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:42,738
You better keep your
dirty socks.

663
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:45,739
I feel, after hearing our tale,
he will...

664
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,575
He will faint.

665
01:02:49,913 --> 01:02:51,141
Gogga.

666
01:02:52,649 --> 01:02:54,549
As of now I've spared you.

667
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:57,685
If I were to tell you about my
Moga's incidence... - No, no, no!

668
01:02:57,854 --> 01:03:00,345
Hey, nephew, don't.

669
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:03,386
Don't tell him the tale
of Moga's incidence.

670
01:03:03,593 --> 01:03:05,584
Poor fellow will go in depression.

671
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:11,531
The rascal is hitting back!

672
01:03:14,137 --> 01:03:16,128
Rascals! Bloody...

673
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:18,196
Fools.

674
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:25,377
Hey, brother.
How come you are here?

675
01:03:26,483 --> 01:03:28,417
He asked us to wait
and have some tea.

676
01:03:28,585 --> 01:03:30,416
Come on, guy.
Call for some fritters too.

677
01:03:30,553 --> 01:03:33,317
We have no time.
We have lot to do.

678
01:03:36,426 --> 01:03:38,485
Hey!
Man with no smell, huh!

679
01:03:39,462 --> 01:03:42,158
Bag.
Bag? What bag?

680
01:03:42,465 --> 01:03:44,433
Something are no good.

681
01:03:45,602 --> 01:03:47,263
Whatever you have give me
all of it.

682
01:03:47,504 --> 01:03:49,563
Oh, Jeet's bag! Right?

683
01:03:50,907 --> 01:03:52,135
Here you go.

684
01:03:54,744 --> 01:03:56,268
Rascal, acting big.

685
01:03:58,414 --> 01:04:00,780
Man got no freaky smile
on his face.

686
01:04:19,736 --> 01:04:20,725
Everything okay?

687
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:22,760
Yeah.

688
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:24,636
Everything is here.

689
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,438
What do you mean?

690
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:35,874
If have doubt, count.

691
01:04:38,688 --> 01:04:40,315
I'm just with you.

692
01:04:40,723 --> 01:04:41,712
Smile.

693
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:43,481
Sure.

694
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,520
Anything else?

695
01:04:59,576 --> 01:05:00,634
Follow him.

696
01:05:01,177 --> 01:05:04,840
Find out where is stays,
who he meets. I want to know.

697
01:05:05,215 --> 01:05:06,204
Yes, boss.

698
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:24,703
I've decided...

699
01:09:27,243 --> 01:09:31,270
...that I'll tell everything
about us to brother Jeet.

700
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:06,770
Hello!

701
01:13:45,367 --> 01:13:46,664
Kabi's doubt was right.

702
01:13:56,679 --> 01:13:57,668
Mac!

703
01:13:59,148 --> 01:14:00,137
You?

704
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:04,085
I had no idea that you'll
turn out to be a cop.

705
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:09,780
Put your gun down Mac.

706
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:13,818
There is lots difference
between you and them, Mac.

707
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:17,290
Mac, listen.

708
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,189
Please.

709
01:14:20,236 --> 01:14:21,396
Don't do this.

710
01:14:23,139 --> 01:14:25,300
Nails do not part from fingers.

711
01:14:30,146 --> 01:14:31,511
Don't force me, Mac.

712
01:14:32,648 --> 01:14:33,637
Please.

713
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:39,552
Don't do this, Mac.

714
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:11,441
Mac!

715
01:15:16,258 --> 01:15:17,350
Mac, listen.

716
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:21,320
Don't force me, Mac.

717
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,431
Mac, please.

718
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:29,396
Mac!
Don't do this, Mac.

719
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:31,329
Please. Mac!

720
01:15:46,355 --> 01:15:48,516
Don't you think about future?

721
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:53,851
Mac.

722
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,495
This is...

723
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:05,404
...This is nothing.

724
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:08,601
When you go there
you'll realize...

725
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:15,776
All my life...

726
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:18,415
...I kept reading other's future.

727
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:19,843
I...

728
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:26,291
But I did not know about myself.

729
01:16:27,596 --> 01:16:28,824
I did not know.

730
01:16:29,398 --> 01:16:31,389
When you had read my
palms...

731
01:16:32,568 --> 01:16:33,728
...had you read this?

732
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:35,792
No.

733
01:16:36,705 --> 01:16:38,502
It's just the beginning.

734
01:16:38,841 --> 01:16:41,105
You'll realize it in future...

735
01:16:44,113 --> 01:16:45,444
...that power of blood...

736
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:50,716
...is so inferior to that
of love's strength.

737
01:17:04,233 --> 01:17:05,222
Mac.

738
01:17:06,101 --> 01:17:08,194
Mac!
Damn!

739
01:17:21,283 --> 01:17:22,807
You love Mirza so much?

740
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:25,809
Yeah.

741
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,145
More than my life.

742
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:33,651
But do you think he too
loves you equally.

743
01:17:36,498 --> 01:17:37,760
Just a moment.

744
01:17:39,268 --> 01:17:41,099
Let's see.
I'll find out.

745
01:17:51,347 --> 01:17:53,144
Yeah, how are you?
- Hello!

746
01:17:56,251 --> 01:17:58,116
I was sitting with Priety.

747
01:17:58,687 --> 01:18:00,348
I was making up my mind.

748
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:03,115
About what?

749
01:18:03,492 --> 01:18:06,290
I am going to tell everything
to my family.

750
01:18:09,431 --> 01:18:11,695
What do you mean?
- About us, silly.

751
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:13,657
About us?

752
01:18:14,436 --> 01:18:16,404
But tell me.
Will you do something for me?

753
01:18:17,306 --> 01:18:19,103
Will you promise me?
- What?

754
01:18:19,742 --> 01:18:21,539
Please promise me, Mirza.

755
01:18:22,745 --> 01:18:24,610
I promise. But tell what it is?

756
01:18:25,614 --> 01:18:27,514
It will be Mac, who I'm
going to tell first of all.

757
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:29,674
Because he highly respects you.

758
01:18:32,388 --> 01:18:34,788
I wish that you'll call and tell him.

759
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:36,723
I will. Promise.

760
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,549
Bye.

761
01:19:56,531 --> 01:19:59,830
In the next few years, you gonna
do some serious fucking time.

762
01:20:00,368 --> 01:20:03,565
You gonna be the guys are heavy
hitters. In there for supplying.

763
01:20:05,073 --> 01:20:06,597
And it's easy to find out
their names...

764
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:08,532
...who did bring him in for.

765
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:11,611
And especially,
who is the main supplier.

766
01:20:29,664 --> 01:20:32,258
Whenever you return home.
Police will arrest you.

767
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,799
You're in the racket.
You're criminal.

768
01:20:34,135 --> 01:20:36,330
Because despite being in police
few of them work with them.

769
01:20:44,646 --> 01:20:46,637
He is master mind in
your organisation.

770
01:20:46,715 --> 01:20:49,684
They're now in to restaurants,
pubs, clubs...

771
01:20:50,085 --> 01:20:53,384
the main thing they trafficking
in large quantities on the street.

772
01:20:54,856 --> 01:20:57,518
So your family needs to be
oblivious to all these things.

773
01:22:20,675 --> 01:22:22,666
Whatever you can you do.

774
01:22:23,478 --> 01:22:25,412
Find out who is behind this
conspiracy.

775
01:22:26,714 --> 01:22:28,375
Excessive delay isn't good, son.

776
01:22:30,452 --> 01:22:33,546
I don't want that anybody from
my family is harmed anymore.

777
01:22:34,088 --> 01:22:36,147
Before that finish them off.

778
01:22:50,338 --> 01:22:51,327
Hello!

779
01:22:52,507 --> 01:22:53,496
Yes, Jeet.

780
01:23:01,816 --> 01:23:03,807
Jeet Singh, I was waiting
for your signal.

781
01:23:05,019 --> 01:23:06,316
We are already ready for it.

782
01:23:19,701 --> 01:23:20,690
Kabi.

783
01:23:23,371 --> 01:23:24,770
Get everyone ready.

784
01:23:28,643 --> 01:23:29,701
All of them.

785
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,467
Hey, breathe with your
mouth closed.

786
01:23:57,539 --> 01:23:59,302
You may get my mouth shut, uncle.

787
01:23:59,374 --> 01:24:01,308
But hunger doesn't die.
Hunger.

788
01:24:01,643 --> 01:24:02,837
I'm hungry, uncle.
Hungry.

789
01:24:03,111 --> 01:24:04,373
At least tell me how to satiate it?

790
01:24:04,445 --> 01:24:06,675
With this very Yoga Asan (posture).
- It's doesn't work.

791
01:24:07,348 --> 01:24:09,043
I did it fifty times, my hunger
has increased more.

792
01:24:09,183 --> 01:24:10,150
Ok, tell me something.

793
01:24:10,218 --> 01:24:11,651
From where do Canada's people
eat?

794
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:13,687
From where people from
Punjab eat. - What?

795
01:24:14,556 --> 01:24:15,784
With mouth.

796
01:24:16,524 --> 01:24:18,014
Look, I will explain.

797
01:24:18,126 --> 01:24:21,095
Here, nobody has time to
cook food.

798
01:24:21,229 --> 01:24:23,129
So, they eat in restaurants.

799
01:24:23,231 --> 01:24:25,199
Uncle! When will my this
desire will fulfill?

800
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:27,426
When will we be able to
eat a nice meal in a restaurant?

801
01:24:27,635 --> 01:24:29,068
I've an idea.
- What?

802
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:32,333
The restaurant which can feed
so many people...

803
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:34,167
...won't it feed us to?

804
01:24:34,542 --> 01:24:37,067
Nephew, be prepared this morning.

805
01:24:37,645 --> 01:24:38,771
Are you sure?

806
01:24:40,448 --> 01:24:41,574
Let's at least eat now.

807
01:24:43,084 --> 01:24:46,520
An addict's first priority is to
feed his addiction.

808
01:24:46,654 --> 01:24:49,316
And the other priority is
to open the bottles.

809
01:24:49,724 --> 01:24:52,591
And the third job of an addict is
to pick up unnecessary fights.

810
01:24:53,394 --> 01:24:55,419
Yeah. The third one
is pick up fights.

811
01:24:55,630 --> 01:25:00,363
Seeking succor we landed
at your door...

812
01:25:00,768 --> 01:25:04,067
The poor kid...

813
01:25:04,105 --> 01:25:05,299
Hey you...

814
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,031
Well-done! Bravo!

815
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:11,410
You sing so well.

816
01:25:11,546 --> 01:25:14,606
You do sing too well...

817
01:25:17,652 --> 01:25:19,085
You did not add water?

818
01:25:19,654 --> 01:25:21,212
Pour some water.

819
01:25:21,456 --> 01:25:23,321
Uncle, what it this, man.

820
01:25:25,326 --> 01:25:27,385
English. English.

821
01:25:27,595 --> 01:25:29,529
First of all I can't speak English.

822
01:25:29,697 --> 01:25:31,392
And you who can speak...

823
01:25:31,466 --> 01:25:33,696
...but you aren't in a condition
to speak when time comes.

824
01:25:34,268 --> 01:25:35,394
Oh, you know?
- What?

825
01:25:36,638 --> 01:25:39,630
When we drink,
English flows through our lips.

826
01:25:39,774 --> 01:25:43,301
Hey, you check this to start with.

827
01:25:43,411 --> 01:25:44,400
Go ahead.

828
01:25:47,615 --> 01:25:50,140
Hey!
- Oh, damn!

829
01:25:52,086 --> 01:25:53,075
Yes, sir.

830
01:25:53,821 --> 01:25:55,083
Are you drunk?

831
01:25:55,256 --> 01:25:56,655
No, no. No, sir, no.

832
01:25:56,724 --> 01:25:58,783
No, sir... We only...

833
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,060
Who has drunk?

834
01:26:01,462 --> 01:26:04,192
Do you drink regularly?
- No, sir.

835
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:07,566
Only on days when we find
some money.

836
01:26:07,769 --> 01:26:09,259
From where did you find money?

837
01:26:09,337 --> 01:26:10,429
From your counter.

838
01:26:10,638 --> 01:26:12,629
Why did you open my counter?
- Just...

839
01:26:13,207 --> 01:26:15,198
And here is your watch too.

840
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:16,477
My watch?

841
01:26:16,544 --> 01:26:18,535
Just to hide your watch...

842
01:26:18,613 --> 01:26:20,547
...as soon I opened the drawer...

843
01:26:20,682 --> 01:26:23,344
We found the money.

844
01:26:24,018 --> 01:26:26,782
And I kept the watch in my pocket.

845
01:26:27,321 --> 01:26:31,189
And I put your money in my pocket.

846
01:26:31,259 --> 01:26:32,351
Very simple.

847
01:26:37,298 --> 01:26:38,287
Damn you!

848
01:26:42,203 --> 01:26:44,569
At least return our clothes, man.

849
01:26:44,706 --> 01:26:46,697
What clothes?
Get lost!

850
01:26:47,241 --> 01:26:49,232
You are telling us to get lost?

851
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:50,572
It's you who will rung.

852
01:26:50,712 --> 01:26:52,509
We are from Punjab.

853
01:26:53,047 --> 01:26:55,038
Remember us we hardened Punjabis.

854
01:26:55,116 --> 01:26:57,676
We are very big goons.

855
01:26:58,086 --> 01:27:01,317
For the first time I was charged
with Section 302 for murder.

856
01:27:01,422 --> 01:27:02,719
Then charged 34.

857
01:27:03,124 --> 01:27:07,220
And I am charged with section 307
many a times.

858
01:27:07,295 --> 01:27:08,489
Then 751...

859
01:27:08,763 --> 01:27:12,199
And I even can't count how
many times I'm charged with 751.

860
01:27:12,266 --> 01:27:14,996
It's just like having desert after
the dinner.

861
01:27:15,103 --> 01:27:19,005
Listening to us, are you
getting fits?

862
01:27:20,541 --> 01:27:22,441
Are you feeling giddy?

863
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:25,376
Son, are you getting scared?

864
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,013
Uncle, I say...

865
01:27:27,381 --> 01:27:29,542
You better keep your nauseating
socks ready.

866
01:27:29,684 --> 01:27:32,414
Such guys get bout of fits.

867
01:27:32,787 --> 01:27:34,584
Dialing 911...

868
01:27:35,389 --> 01:27:38,051
...should not we call for ambulance
for him? - Uncle...

869
01:27:40,461 --> 01:27:43,191
By the way, I did not...

870
01:27:43,264 --> 01:27:46,495
...let him listen to my Moga's
incidence... - Hey, hold on.

871
01:27:46,567 --> 01:27:48,694
No, nephew! No!

872
01:27:49,237 --> 01:27:52,035
No. He'll go in depression.

873
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:55,031
The kid will be depressed, uncle.

874
01:27:55,276 --> 01:27:57,244
He...
He is gone in depression.

875
01:27:58,045 --> 01:27:59,444
He is in depression.

876
01:28:00,782 --> 01:28:02,306
He's in depression.

877
01:28:03,117 --> 01:28:05,381
Hold on, both of you.
I'll show you...

878
01:28:05,453 --> 01:28:07,546
Hey, this guy turns out to be...

879
01:28:11,492 --> 01:28:13,289
Sahiba, I know what you
are undergoing.

880
01:28:16,464 --> 01:28:18,295
But what's in fate no one
can avoid.

881
01:28:21,269 --> 01:28:22,600
But, why only Mac?

882
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:26,229
He never even thought
ill of anybody.

883
01:28:29,477 --> 01:28:31,104
That was an accident.

884
01:28:31,779 --> 01:28:33,246
Due to gas leakage...

885
01:28:34,148 --> 01:28:35,740
...entire warehouse caught fire.

886
01:28:36,751 --> 01:28:39,049
No one working their survived.

887
01:28:40,288 --> 01:28:41,277
I know.

888
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:44,758
But even Mac's body wasn't found.

889
01:28:45,426 --> 01:28:48,691
Brother Jeet says, police is
investigating.

890
01:28:51,065 --> 01:28:52,794
Entire atmosphere of the
house is ruined.

891
01:28:54,302 --> 01:28:56,099
I was about to tell him about us...

892
01:28:56,571 --> 01:28:58,402
...but, not now.

893
01:29:01,075 --> 01:29:02,167
Have courage.

894
01:29:03,077 --> 01:29:04,544
I am always with you.

895
01:29:07,281 --> 01:29:08,714
Rest is, what's in fate...

896
01:29:11,319 --> 01:29:12,752
...nobody can alter that.

897
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:17,479
I know.

898
01:29:33,441 --> 01:29:35,136
Lift the phone.
Take up the call.

899
01:29:40,581 --> 01:29:42,173
Pick the damn phone.

900
01:29:43,251 --> 01:29:44,445
What's up dude?

901
01:29:44,652 --> 01:29:45,641
What's up.

902
01:29:46,821 --> 01:29:48,288
What's up, Frank?

903
01:29:49,123 --> 01:29:51,091
I need some information.

904
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:53,486
All possible information
pertaining to my guy.

905
01:29:54,729 --> 01:29:56,094
Mac is no more.

906
01:29:57,565 --> 01:29:59,089
Might as well no can do.

907
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:00,463
It's out of my Department, Jeet.

908
01:30:00,635 --> 01:30:03,661
Is it?
That's beyond your department.

909
01:30:04,805 --> 01:30:06,500
What kind of cop you are?

910
01:30:07,074 --> 01:30:08,769
Make it a part of your department.

911
01:30:09,277 --> 01:30:10,437
I hope I'm understood.

912
01:30:10,611 --> 01:30:13,273
I need every piece of information
I can on this.

913
01:30:15,082 --> 01:30:16,709
Understand,
you greedy little prick?

914
01:30:17,718 --> 01:30:19,049
Have you understood?

915
01:30:19,553 --> 01:30:22,078
Listen there's no evidence to
implicate anyone.

916
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:25,750
Trust me. Folks around here
are in a hurry to find.

917
01:30:26,427 --> 01:30:27,587
You damn shit!

918
01:30:30,498 --> 01:30:32,363
I will not remind you again.
Got it?

919
01:30:34,201 --> 01:30:36,396
So do, what I pay you to do.

920
01:30:38,339 --> 01:30:39,829
I hope I'm understood.

921
01:30:48,849 --> 01:30:50,214
Where is Mirza?

922
01:30:58,459 --> 01:31:00,324
What happened wasn't right.

923
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:02,128
What's the news?

924
01:31:03,397 --> 01:31:04,489
The rascal Chinks...

925
01:31:05,599 --> 01:31:07,760
...they got it done.
He hired somebody.

926
01:31:11,572 --> 01:31:13,335
Since last few days they
are quiet active.

927
01:31:13,607 --> 01:31:15,370
Want to have their
footing in the city.

928
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:26,108
Mirza!

929
01:31:26,654 --> 01:31:28,781
Latest addition
to the organization.

930
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:32,357
Now, we've been trying to get
these guys down...

931
01:31:32,426 --> 01:31:34,087
...and they keep coming up clean.

932
01:31:34,261 --> 01:31:36,058
So, I want everyone else there...

933
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:38,064
...digging up anything
they can find on him.

934
01:31:38,599 --> 01:31:40,157
And I mean anything.

935
01:31:41,635 --> 01:31:44,297
You and your men would do
nothing of that sort.

936
01:31:44,405 --> 01:31:45,429
Detective Miller.

937
01:31:45,506 --> 01:31:48,498
I had a guy on the inside
for the past six months.

938
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:50,643
And you are gonna screw it up.

939
01:31:52,146 --> 01:31:54,205
Jeet, you're not
gonna believe this.

940
01:32:37,191 --> 01:32:38,180
Yes.

941
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:39,348
Where are you?

942
01:32:39,593 --> 01:32:40,582
Can you meet up?

943
01:32:42,163 --> 01:32:43,152
Yes, when?

944
01:32:44,465 --> 01:32:45,454
Right now.

945
01:32:46,567 --> 01:32:47,556
Where?

946
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:51,802
Would you believe?

947
01:32:54,642 --> 01:32:57,110
It's July and it's heavily snowing.

948
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:01,512
One makes mistake
He doesn't look back.

949
01:33:08,355 --> 01:33:10,016
I have immense trust in you.

950
01:33:12,326 --> 01:33:14,089
Jeet, I don't feel that I can...

951
01:33:15,196 --> 01:33:17,528
Will you be late?

952
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,435
Jeet, treated you well.

953
01:33:28,676 --> 01:33:30,803
I doubted you from day one.

954
01:33:31,145 --> 01:33:32,476
It was Jeet...

955
01:33:33,047 --> 01:33:35,379
...who believed you more
than his brothers.

956
01:36:57,117 --> 01:36:58,607
I knew you'd kill me.

957
01:38:20,734 --> 01:38:21,996
What do you want?

958
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,166
Why did you do it?

959
01:38:28,642 --> 01:38:30,234
I did not do it for myself.

960
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:32,712
I did it for those whose lives...

961
01:38:33,514 --> 01:38:34,708
...because of you...

962
01:38:35,048 --> 01:38:37,039
...was ruined and that of
your brother's.

963
01:38:43,524 --> 01:38:44,718
Bring him down.

964
01:38:58,539 --> 01:39:00,200
Life.

965
01:39:01,809 --> 01:39:03,242
Talking of life?

966
01:39:05,379 --> 01:39:06,812
He was your brother, isn't it?

967
01:39:10,484 --> 01:39:11,815
But the difference is just one.

968
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:15,081
He used to about with a pen...

969
01:39:15,656 --> 01:39:17,089
...and you with arms.

970
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:20,615
Amar.

971
01:39:24,498 --> 01:39:27,092
Amar... With Amar's hands...

972
01:39:35,242 --> 01:39:36,231
No.

973
01:39:37,644 --> 01:39:39,202
That's not my style.

974
01:39:42,349 --> 01:39:43,782
Deesha finished him.

975
01:39:47,654 --> 01:39:49,781
Incidentally, we didn't
want to kill him.

976
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:52,122
You wanna live?

977
01:39:53,527 --> 01:39:54,721
What can we do?

978
01:39:57,531 --> 01:39:58,520
Deesha.

979
01:39:58,699 --> 01:40:00,530
Ask Deesha,
making him understand...

980
01:40:01,802 --> 01:40:03,463
...that he shouldn't fall
in my hands...

981
01:40:03,604 --> 01:40:04,798
...and keep remembering God.

982
01:40:05,205 --> 01:40:06,194
Because...

983
01:40:06,673 --> 01:40:08,163
I am not going to spare him.

984
01:40:08,509 --> 01:40:09,771
Won't spare him.

985
01:40:11,411 --> 01:40:13,038
I will not leave him.

986
01:40:18,118 --> 01:40:19,449
I accepted you as mine.

987
01:40:21,555 --> 01:40:23,079
But you stabbed me at the back.

988
01:40:27,561 --> 01:40:28,721
Take him away.

989
01:40:32,232 --> 01:40:33,221
Take him.

990
01:40:37,437 --> 01:40:38,699
It's your right.

991
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:47,613
I had thought much about us.

992
01:40:49,216 --> 01:40:50,774
But, perhaps our ways...

993
01:40:51,285 --> 01:40:53,116
...were different.

994
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:07,698
I can't understand.

995
01:41:11,705 --> 01:41:13,434
Can't understand, can't.

996
01:41:16,143 --> 01:41:18,407
I don't understand how to
kill you.

997
01:41:19,813 --> 01:41:21,371
Jeet had thought...

998
01:41:22,449 --> 01:41:24,644
...that he will kill you with
his own hands.

999
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:28,183
Right over your death...

1000
01:41:31,158 --> 01:41:32,216
...Kabi has.

1001
01:41:34,494 --> 01:41:35,552
Do you know?

1002
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:38,059
You were one of Jeet's friends.

1003
01:41:39,733 --> 01:41:41,428
Believed in you more than Chinks.

1004
01:41:43,537 --> 01:41:45,698
But then you...
What did you do?

1005
01:41:47,507 --> 01:41:49,475
You kill friends!

1006
01:42:04,524 --> 01:42:06,389
If I was a friend killer...

1007
01:42:09,062 --> 01:42:11,530
...then by now you'd have
been long dead.

1008
01:42:19,706 --> 01:42:21,640
It's your food fortune...

1009
01:42:25,379 --> 01:42:27,040
...that you're her brother...

1010
01:42:28,482 --> 01:42:29,642
...who I love.

1011
01:42:36,823 --> 01:42:38,415
As you are gonna kill me...

1012
01:42:39,393 --> 01:42:41,224
...then make sure that I am dead.

1013
01:42:42,362 --> 01:42:44,159
Because, if I survived...

1014
01:42:46,333 --> 01:42:48,824
...then I will kill you in
such a way...

1015
01:42:50,103 --> 01:42:52,196
...that you'll remember it for
the rest of your life.

1016
01:43:04,117 --> 01:43:06,517
Your thinking is very fine.
Really good.

1017
01:43:07,354 --> 01:43:08,480
But what to do.

1018
01:43:11,258 --> 01:43:12,748
It won't be fulfilled.

1019
01:44:10,117 --> 01:44:13,177
Priety. I tried calling him.

1020
01:44:14,154 --> 01:44:16,782
I tried many times.
He just doesn't pick up.

1021
01:44:18,525 --> 01:44:20,789
I'm very apprehensive.

1022
01:44:21,762 --> 01:44:23,229
I don't know why.

1023
01:44:24,231 --> 01:44:26,222
I'm gonna go to his apartment.

1024
01:44:28,101 --> 01:44:30,069
At least I'll see whether is
all right.

1025
01:44:31,538 --> 01:44:33,529
Okay. Bye.

1026
01:45:03,403 --> 01:45:04,335
Mirza!

1027
01:45:06,139 --> 01:45:07,128
Mirza!

1028
01:45:09,543 --> 01:45:10,532
Mirza!

1029
01:45:15,382 --> 01:45:16,371
Mirza...

1030
01:45:20,687 --> 01:45:21,676
Mirza?

1031
01:45:29,162 --> 01:45:30,151
Mirza.

1032
01:45:32,499 --> 01:45:33,488
Kabi?

1033
01:45:50,217 --> 01:45:51,445
Now it's no use killing.

1034
01:45:53,153 --> 01:45:54,552
I am already of Mirza.

1035
01:45:56,523 --> 01:45:57,820
He's dead.

1036
01:45:59,326 --> 01:46:00,486
Do you hear me?

1037
01:46:02,095 --> 01:46:03,119
Death.

1038
01:46:10,036 --> 01:46:11,196
I don't believe you.

1039
01:46:13,673 --> 01:46:15,106
I don't believe you!

1040
01:46:17,043 --> 01:46:18,476
I don't believe you...

1041
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:27,008
No! No, no! No!

1042
01:46:29,189 --> 01:46:31,521
Mirza can't leave me and go.

1043
01:46:33,059 --> 01:46:34,720
Mirza can't die!

1044
01:46:38,031 --> 01:46:39,259
Hey, who's here so early?

1045
01:46:42,469 --> 01:46:44,300
I am coming, buddy.
Wait for a minute.

1046
01:46:48,341 --> 01:46:49,330
Mirza!

1047
01:46:50,176 --> 01:46:51,734
Hey, what happened to you, buddy?

1048
01:46:54,314 --> 01:46:55,474
You are shot!

1049
01:46:59,252 --> 01:47:00,480
Come on, man.
You see...

1050
01:47:09,429 --> 01:47:11,124
Let me call the ambulance.

1051
01:47:17,771 --> 01:47:19,602
Not hospital.
At home.

1052
01:47:20,173 --> 01:47:21,572
If you send me to hospital...

1053
01:47:22,542 --> 01:47:24,476
No, hospital. Take me home.

1054
01:47:25,578 --> 01:47:27,512
If you took me to hospital...

1055
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:32,179
Looking at your condition...

1056
01:47:32,519 --> 01:47:34,453
...I don't feel that we'd reach
in time.

1057
01:47:35,655 --> 01:47:37,179
It will take five hours from here.

1058
01:47:37,257 --> 01:47:39,418
You do know, we won't.

1059
01:47:41,728 --> 01:47:43,719
Okay. I have no other option.

1060
01:47:44,431 --> 01:47:45,420
Home.

1061
01:47:47,033 --> 01:47:48,022
Ok.
- Home.

1062
01:47:48,368 --> 01:47:50,461
Then let's go quick.

1063
01:47:58,378 --> 01:47:59,572
Does he know?
- Yes.

1064
01:48:00,613 --> 01:48:02,205
About Mac?
- No.

1065
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:15,223
If you were not my brother...

1066
01:48:18,198 --> 01:48:19,392
...you'd not have lived.

1067
01:48:30,710 --> 01:48:32,439
Sahiba!
Sahiba...

1068
01:48:32,679 --> 01:48:34,670
Sahiba, listen to me.
- Go, get away from me.

1069
01:48:34,748 --> 01:48:36,010
Listen to me.

1070
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:38,208
Don't touch me!
- Sahiba, I'm sorry.

1071
01:48:38,451 --> 01:48:39,440
You're a monster.

1072
01:48:39,519 --> 01:48:41,612
Please try to understand,
I'm not wrong.

1073
01:48:41,688 --> 01:48:43,178
I'm not wrong. I am not...
- I hate you.

1074
01:48:43,256 --> 01:48:45,156
I this right? - Don't touch me
with your dirty hand!

1075
01:48:45,225 --> 01:48:46,453
Leave me!
- Sahiba!

1076
01:48:46,793 --> 01:48:49,227
I hate you!
You are a monster!

1077
01:48:49,596 --> 01:48:51,496
You are a... Monster.

1078
01:48:52,599 --> 01:48:53,623
I hate you!

1079
01:48:54,701 --> 01:48:57,534
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you...

1080
01:48:58,138 --> 01:48:59,605
I hate you...
- Just calm down.

1081
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:01,605
You're a monster...

1082
01:49:02,042 --> 01:49:03,600
You're a monster...
- No.

1083
01:49:06,046 --> 01:49:07,070
We are fine.

1084
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:24,519
Mirza?

1085
01:49:27,567 --> 01:49:29,330
Daddy, come fast!

1086
01:49:29,636 --> 01:49:31,536
Hey, what happened?
- Mirza!

1087
01:49:35,375 --> 01:49:37,605
Dad, call an ambulance immediately.
- No!

1088
01:49:37,744 --> 01:49:39,609
No, no. Not ambulance.

1089
01:49:39,746 --> 01:49:41,475
Mirza! Mirza!

1090
01:49:42,182 --> 01:49:43,479
I already knew...

1091
01:49:44,217 --> 01:49:46,344
...that this is going to happen
one of these days.

1092
01:49:46,486 --> 01:49:48,283
Dad!
Please stop it!

1093
01:49:48,421 --> 01:49:49,513
Let him die.

1094
01:49:50,156 --> 01:49:51,646
Because what good he's
going to bring to us.

1095
01:49:51,724 --> 01:49:52,713
Dad!

1096
01:49:52,826 --> 01:49:54,225
You please shut up.

1097
01:49:54,561 --> 01:49:56,426
Take him in for the treatment.
- Mirza!

1098
01:49:56,496 --> 01:49:58,794
Mirza, please say something.
- You don't your son.

1099
01:50:00,733 --> 01:50:01,722
Mirza...

1100
01:50:02,635 --> 01:50:03,624
Mirza...

1101
01:50:42,208 --> 01:50:44,199
I killed my own father
with these very hands.

1102
01:50:46,613 --> 01:50:48,205
Because he was a drug dealer.

1103
01:50:50,483 --> 01:50:51,711
Every days fights.

1104
01:50:52,585 --> 01:50:55,748
...and because of his deeds
my mom got infected with HIV.

1105
01:50:57,257 --> 01:50:58,281
Poor she...

1106
01:51:00,426 --> 01:51:01,859
...died horribly.

1107
01:51:03,630 --> 01:51:05,325
My 16 years old sister.

1108
01:51:08,535 --> 01:51:09,763
She left the house.

1109
01:51:13,173 --> 01:51:14,697
I don't even know where she is.

1110
01:51:15,041 --> 01:51:16,235
In what condition she is.

1111
01:51:17,177 --> 01:51:19,042
I couldn't do anything for her.

1112
01:51:22,048 --> 01:51:23,037
And then...

1113
01:51:25,218 --> 01:51:26,549
...I went to jail.

1114
01:51:30,823 --> 01:51:32,347
Mirza met me there.

1115
01:51:49,776 --> 01:51:51,266
For how long, man?

1116
01:51:57,116 --> 01:51:59,084
Life imprisonment.
- Life imprisonment?

1117
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:03,084
What did you do?
You don't like that.

1118
01:52:06,359 --> 01:52:07,656
I killed a drug dealer.

1119
01:52:08,294 --> 01:52:10,387
Good.
Such rascals should die.

1120
01:52:13,633 --> 01:52:15,032
He was my own father.

1121
01:52:18,171 --> 01:52:20,162
He was the only one who
understood me...

1122
01:52:21,140 --> 01:52:23,370
...that what I have suffered
and what hardship I've faced.

1123
01:52:23,776 --> 01:52:25,073
I was broken.

1124
01:52:26,246 --> 01:52:28,043
I had lost hopes from life.

1125
01:52:29,182 --> 01:52:30,444
I was thinking...

1126
01:52:31,718 --> 01:52:33,242
...whether I too at some time...

1127
01:52:33,686 --> 01:52:35,745
...can live a life of normal man?

1128
01:52:37,557 --> 01:52:39,422
I was sentenced life imprisonment.

1129
01:52:40,827 --> 01:52:41,816
But he...

1130
01:52:42,829 --> 01:52:44,524
He got me out or prison.

1131
01:52:46,699 --> 01:52:48,360
I can't ever repay him.

1132
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,630
Don't you get such bad dreams.

1133
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:58,636
You must have had.

1134
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:02,570
Where do I get dreams, nephew.

1135
01:53:03,683 --> 01:53:06,151
Since the time I left my village...

1136
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,215
...I never could sleep.

1137
01:53:10,056 --> 01:53:12,183
The kind which I used to
get on the terrace of my house...

1138
01:53:13,059 --> 01:53:15,118
...counting the stars in the sky.

1139
01:53:15,194 --> 01:53:16,354
You are right, uncle.

1140
01:53:17,230 --> 01:53:19,027
The pleasure which have
in your backyard...

1141
01:53:19,232 --> 01:53:20,631
...you can't get anywhere else.

1142
01:53:21,034 --> 01:53:22,023
Uncle...

1143
01:53:22,468 --> 01:53:24,629
...we should not have come to
Canada illegally.

1144
01:53:25,505 --> 01:53:27,063
Sometimes I feel...

1145
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:29,264
...by leaving our house...

1146
01:53:30,076 --> 01:53:31,509
...we took a wrong decision.

1147
01:53:31,811 --> 01:53:34,746
Nephew, even decisions are
taken out of compulsions.

1148
01:53:36,582 --> 01:53:38,379
When we lived in village...

1149
01:53:39,719 --> 01:53:41,619
...then we were poor
and starving.

1150
01:53:43,256 --> 01:53:44,518
I still remember...

1151
01:53:46,092 --> 01:53:49,584
...when I saw my mother wearing
torn and patched dress...

1152
01:53:49,829 --> 01:53:51,660
...my heart used to come
on my hands.

1153
01:53:52,398 --> 01:53:54,389
All the earnings of the harvest...

1154
01:53:55,068 --> 01:53:57,093
...used to go to moneylender.

1155
01:53:58,071 --> 01:54:00,301
Despite having sold the harvest
for thousands...

1156
01:54:00,373 --> 01:54:02,500
...father used to not have
even money for the fare.

1157
01:54:04,077 --> 01:54:07,672
Father used to come walking
from the market to the village.

1158
01:54:09,349 --> 01:54:12,011
As the conditions of the house
did not change, then...

1159
01:54:14,354 --> 01:54:17,289
...just after two years of marriage,
I decided...

1160
01:54:17,357 --> 01:54:20,087
...that I'll migrate to Canada
and make money.

1161
01:54:22,395 --> 01:54:23,384
So that...

1162
01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:26,362
...I could see my parents happy.

1163
01:54:27,266 --> 01:54:29,325
But even after coming here,
my ill fate...

1164
01:54:29,702 --> 01:54:31,067
...did not spare me.

1165
01:54:32,038 --> 01:54:33,528
All my earnings...

1166
01:54:34,173 --> 01:54:36,767
...I spent on lawyers to make
my migrations legal.

1167
01:54:39,278 --> 01:54:41,269
Today, once again I got
message from the embassy...

1168
01:54:41,347 --> 01:54:44,282
...that it will still take five
more years.

1169
01:54:44,784 --> 01:54:48,083
God knows whether it will
be done even after 5 years.

1170
01:54:56,262 --> 01:54:59,425
Just waiting for this...

1171
01:55:02,235 --> 01:55:04,203
...my parents went to God.

1172
01:55:06,406 --> 01:55:09,273
Forget about giving my
shoulder to their bier...

1173
01:55:10,676 --> 01:55:13,144
I couldn't see even their faces.

1174
01:55:15,281 --> 01:55:17,340
Last month elder sister expired.

1175
01:55:20,353 --> 01:55:23,345
My daughter Guddo was
one year old when...

1176
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:25,621
...came to Canada.

1177
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:29,788
Just a year old.

1178
01:55:31,397 --> 01:55:34,127
Now within no time she grew up
and now she's marriageable age.

1179
01:55:35,701 --> 01:55:39,137
I even don't know whether
she'd recognize me or not.

1180
01:55:45,111 --> 01:55:48,376
Without having gotten confirmed
here I can't even go back.

1181
01:55:49,215 --> 01:55:51,513
People will comment,
God knows from where...

1182
01:55:52,118 --> 01:55:54,609
...he has returned empty handed.

1183
01:56:04,764 --> 01:56:07,096
Of course Canada is undoubtedly...

1184
01:56:07,667 --> 01:56:09,692
...is very prosperous.

1185
01:56:12,038 --> 01:56:14,063
May be there are all the
leisure available here.

1186
01:56:16,142 --> 01:56:20,272
Yet, the love of my village
keeps pulling me day and night.

1187
01:56:23,049 --> 01:56:25,244
Nephew, even today I want to...

1188
01:56:25,318 --> 01:56:29,084
...die on the soil of my village.

1189
01:56:30,590 --> 01:56:33,024
I want my village's...

1190
01:56:34,026 --> 01:56:35,516
...soil...

1191
01:56:36,329 --> 01:56:37,318
I say...

1192
01:56:39,198 --> 01:56:40,426
I will take you to Punjab.

1193
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:42,465
Let people say what they want.

1194
01:56:43,069 --> 01:56:44,400
We'll return to Punjab, uncle.

1195
01:56:44,737 --> 01:56:47,399
We will go to Punjab.
- Take me there, nephew.

1196
01:56:47,473 --> 01:56:49,464
Take me to Punjab.

1197
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:54,769
Even if I die here, there
won't be anyone my own.

1198
01:56:55,381 --> 01:57:00,409
I can't die without being
on my motherland.

1199
01:57:02,088 --> 01:57:04,613
Nephew, take me to our village.

1200
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:07,250
We shall go, uncle.
I will take you there.

1201
01:57:07,326 --> 01:57:09,191
I don't want to die here.

1202
01:57:15,134 --> 01:57:16,192
Dad.

1203
01:57:18,304 --> 01:57:19,601
It's 5th today.

1204
01:57:28,014 --> 01:57:29,641
Have courage, my child.
Have courage.

1205
01:57:30,583 --> 01:57:31,572
Courage?

1206
01:57:33,019 --> 01:57:34,043
Firsts mom.

1207
01:57:36,122 --> 01:57:37,111
Then Amar.

1208
01:57:40,526 --> 01:57:42,118
And Mirza is in such a condition.

1209
01:57:42,295 --> 01:57:43,785
How could I've courage, dad?

1210
01:57:45,398 --> 01:57:47,229
Don't be disheartened,
my dear child.

1211
01:57:48,601 --> 01:57:50,034
God will do good.

1212
01:58:02,448 --> 01:58:03,710
Dad!

1213
01:58:04,250 --> 01:58:06,013
Dad!
- Yes, dear.

1214
01:58:07,987 --> 01:58:09,750
Mirza! Mirza!

1215
01:58:15,328 --> 01:58:16,625
Oh, Mirza!

1216
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:23,034
Just rest. Don't move.

1217
01:58:23,102 --> 01:58:25,070
Don't move, son. Don't.

1218
01:58:25,504 --> 01:58:28,769
Your wounds haven't healed yet.
Take rest.

1219
01:58:30,009 --> 01:58:31,340
How much it's connected.

1220
01:58:31,677 --> 01:58:33,042
You...
- Yes?

1221
01:58:36,315 --> 01:58:37,304
Sahiba.

1222
01:58:38,551 --> 01:58:40,451
Are you in conscious, son?
- Sahiba...

1223
01:58:42,622 --> 01:58:45,386
You take rest.
Everything will be fine.

1224
01:58:45,591 --> 01:58:47,115
Sahiba.
- You need to rest.

1225
01:58:48,494 --> 01:58:49,756
Sahiba.
- What?

1226
01:58:51,097 --> 01:58:52,086
Sahiba...

1227
01:59:10,383 --> 01:59:11,782
Hey, Terry, how come you're here?

1228
01:59:12,451 --> 01:59:15,511
Well, well. After long time
I am seeing you.

1229
01:59:16,355 --> 01:59:17,754
It's a wedding season
now a days.

1230
01:59:17,823 --> 01:59:19,620
This is the opportunity I got
now to make money.

1231
01:59:19,692 --> 01:59:21,455
15 limos will go for the wedding.

1232
01:59:21,527 --> 01:59:23,552
15 limos?
Who's booked them.

1233
01:59:23,763 --> 01:59:26,789
You know our Jeet.
It's for her sister's wedding.

1234
01:59:29,268 --> 01:59:32,396
Jeet
His sister is Sahiba!

1235
01:59:41,781 --> 01:59:43,646
Dad, please also take care
of our health.

1236
01:59:44,316 --> 01:59:46,113
All day work, work and work.

1237
01:59:46,452 --> 01:59:48,443
This will continue forever.
- Son.

1238
01:59:49,188 --> 01:59:52,316
I don't what misconceptions
I had about you.

1239
01:59:52,525 --> 01:59:54,618
But when I came to no about you...

1240
01:59:55,094 --> 01:59:57,221
...my age went up by
immediately by 20 years.

1241
01:59:57,763 --> 02:00:00,357
That's fine, did.
Even then take care of your health.

1242
02:00:00,433 --> 02:00:02,333
Son, nothing is going to
happen to me.

1243
02:00:02,535 --> 02:00:04,093
Mirza, Behals's phone for you.

1244
02:00:04,336 --> 02:00:06,236
You don't listen, dad.
You just argue.

1245
02:00:06,572 --> 02:00:07,596
Yes, Behal!

1246
02:00:17,116 --> 02:00:18,105
When?

1247
02:00:23,622 --> 02:00:25,249
Behal, he was Ranjha.

1248
02:00:25,658 --> 02:00:29,424
Who despite taking their herd
to pasture, lost Heer to somebody.

1249
02:00:31,797 --> 02:00:34,527
But Mirza and Sahiba's story
something different.

1250
02:00:36,469 --> 02:00:37,697
I may die...

1251
02:00:39,105 --> 02:00:41,198
...but I can't let Sahiba
go with someone else.

1252
02:00:42,575 --> 02:00:44,668
You be prepared.
I am coming.

1253
02:00:45,711 --> 02:00:48,339
Don't go.
Don't go, my son.

1254
02:00:49,148 --> 02:00:51,378
I can't bear to lose one
more son.

1255
02:00:53,853 --> 02:00:55,480
Your son isn't so weak, dad.

1256
02:00:56,322 --> 02:00:58,347
Don't worry. Nothing will
happen to me.

1257
02:01:00,092 --> 02:01:01,559
Manak Saheb has said:

1258
02:01:03,362 --> 02:01:07,196
Trusting a woman is like
365 character of deceptions...

1259
02:01:07,533 --> 02:01:09,364
...because it's double
edged sword.

1260
02:01:10,302 --> 02:01:11,792
All five fingers aren't
the same, dad.

1261
02:01:12,605 --> 02:01:14,402
But without bringing Sahiba...

1262
02:01:15,074 --> 02:01:16,268
...I have no way out.

1263
02:01:16,609 --> 02:01:18,201
Entire town knows, son.

1264
02:01:18,644 --> 02:01:20,202
How dangerous they are.

1265
02:01:20,479 --> 02:01:22,379
If you listen to me,
let it be.

1266
02:01:22,782 --> 02:01:26,718
I knew this fact even before
I fell in love with Sahiba.

1267
02:01:29,054 --> 02:01:31,545
Now, it's either me or them.

1268
02:01:32,324 --> 02:01:33,313
If it's so.

1269
02:01:34,093 --> 02:01:35,287
Then take these keys.

1270
02:01:36,562 --> 02:01:38,086
And take the Mare.

1271
02:02:04,089 --> 02:02:05,750
Yes, son?
- Daddy! Daddy!

1272
02:02:06,725 --> 02:02:08,716
Why did you keep it's name
as Mare?

1273
02:02:09,128 --> 02:02:12,620
I will tell you about it
when you'll bring your bride.

1274
02:02:46,765 --> 02:02:47,754
Give me, dad.

1275
02:02:48,467 --> 02:02:50,059
Today I'm going on your Mare.

1276
02:02:50,836 --> 02:02:52,098
To bring my bride.

1277
02:02:52,671 --> 02:02:55,799
You still remember?
I'm proud of your memory, son.

1278
02:02:57,543 --> 02:02:59,101
I won't say that, dad.

1279
02:02:59,645 --> 02:03:01,670
But you did not tell me
why did you keep its name...

1280
02:03:02,381 --> 02:03:03,370
...as Mare.

1281
02:03:03,549 --> 02:03:05,107
This I will tell you...

1282
02:03:05,484 --> 02:03:06,712
...when you return.

1283
02:03:07,019 --> 02:03:08,782
I'll just go and return.

1284
02:03:18,731 --> 02:03:19,720
Dad.

1285
02:03:20,532 --> 02:03:23,023
I don't know why I am feeling
so jittery.

1286
02:04:03,509 --> 02:04:06,069
Are you sure, that you're
not gonna step back?

1287
02:04:08,547 --> 02:04:09,741
I have no choice Behal.

1288
02:04:10,382 --> 02:04:13,647
If it's so, then accept a small
gift from your friend, my tiger.

1289
02:05:24,757 --> 02:05:26,452
Seems it's going to be storm.

1290
02:05:33,499 --> 02:05:35,023
He must be coming.

1291
02:05:36,635 --> 02:05:37,693
Who?

1292
02:05:39,671 --> 02:05:40,660
Mirza.

1293
02:05:49,448 --> 02:05:50,437
Hello!

1294
02:05:51,316 --> 02:05:53,113
Bring Sahiba, it's time for
Henna ceremony.

1295
02:05:53,185 --> 02:05:54,413
Ok. I will being her.

1296
02:05:55,621 --> 02:05:56,610
Sahiba.

1297
02:05:59,391 --> 02:06:00,790
It's time for henna.

1298
02:06:05,164 --> 02:06:06,153
You go.

1299
02:06:07,499 --> 02:06:08,557
I will come.

1300
02:06:12,404 --> 02:06:13,530
Don't take much time.

1301
02:06:14,706 --> 02:06:16,196
Everybody is waiting.

1302
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:24,775
On hands of Sahiba the henna
will be that of Mirza only.

1303
02:09:18,657 --> 02:09:19,749
Mr. Wrestler.

1304
02:09:20,325 --> 02:09:23,123
Why are you taking tension
for someone else's sister.

1305
02:10:02,501 --> 02:10:03,490
Mirza.

1306
02:10:49,581 --> 02:10:51,173
Jeet!

1307
02:10:51,516 --> 02:10:52,710
Sahiba is not in here room.

1308
02:12:14,466 --> 02:12:15,626
Hey, what he is up to?

1309
02:12:18,703 --> 02:12:20,466
This was your third and
last mistake.

1310
02:12:21,773 --> 02:12:23,673
Sahiba's luck was strong,
that she survived.

1311
02:12:24,543 --> 02:12:25,703
But I killed him!

1312
02:12:26,111 --> 02:12:28,306
How did that rascal survive!
- Bring the car.

1313
02:12:30,081 --> 02:12:31,514
I say bring the car.

1314
02:13:07,719 --> 02:13:08,743
Hold tight.

1315
02:13:10,755 --> 02:13:13,053
I still have accounts to settle
with him.

1316
02:13:19,197 --> 02:13:20,528
What do you think?

1317
02:13:21,066 --> 02:13:22,761
You'll take my Sahiba away?

1318
02:13:23,435 --> 02:13:25,062
You'll take her? Yeah?

1319
02:13:26,505 --> 02:13:28,063
You'll kill me, yeah?

1320
02:13:31,176 --> 02:13:33,770
Tell me! Tell me!

1321
02:13:36,381 --> 02:13:38,315
Rascal is here to die.

1322
02:13:39,784 --> 02:13:41,479
Don't worry.
- No, no.

1323
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:43,185
I'll back soon.

1324
02:13:44,523 --> 02:13:46,650
I won't kill.
- Don't worry, Sahiba.

1325
02:13:47,158 --> 02:13:48,750
I know you.

1326
02:13:52,631 --> 02:13:53,791
Speak you cop!

1327
02:14:11,583 --> 02:14:14,381
Come on, man cross here.

1328
02:14:15,687 --> 02:14:17,484
Deesha is here now. Deesha.

1329
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:25,121
Hey, get up.
Hey, buddy.

1330
02:14:27,566 --> 02:14:28,555
Get up.

1331
02:14:29,601 --> 02:14:30,590
Hey!

1332
02:14:33,138 --> 02:14:36,130
Good. You're aim is too good.
Yeah?

1333
02:14:39,144 --> 02:14:41,078
You are good shooter?

1334
02:14:42,414 --> 02:14:43,403
Now...

1335
02:14:44,282 --> 02:14:46,079
Deesha will show his
sharp shooting.

1336
02:14:47,519 --> 02:14:50,215
You're ready, my boy?
You're ready?

1337
02:15:08,039 --> 02:15:10,667
Hey, where are you going?
Hey, you are scared?

1338
02:15:19,751 --> 02:15:21,116
Hey, what's this?

1339
02:15:21,419 --> 02:15:22,579
Bow and arrow!

1340
02:15:24,656 --> 02:15:27,090
Now don't start praying.

1341
02:15:28,326 --> 02:15:30,055
Baby, come.

1342
02:15:46,344 --> 02:15:48,107
Hey, what have you hit me with?

1343
02:15:48,179 --> 02:15:49,646
It's paining.

1344
02:15:54,552 --> 02:15:56,144
What have you hit me with?

1345
02:15:58,390 --> 02:16:00,790
You should shoot me.
Finish the thing.

1346
02:16:02,661 --> 02:16:04,424
End my pain.

1347
02:16:10,602 --> 02:16:11,762
Hey, you are my friend.

1348
02:16:12,604 --> 02:16:15,095
Pump the bullet and finish off.

1349
02:16:17,575 --> 02:16:18,735
Come on, man!

1350
02:16:20,278 --> 02:16:21,677
Okay, we'll meet in hell.

1351
02:16:23,048 --> 02:16:24,481
Is your job is that of Visa.

1352
02:16:25,116 --> 02:16:26,208
Sometimes I'll...

1353
02:16:27,218 --> 02:16:28,651
Where else will I go.

1354
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:32,314
Damn you! Kill me.

1355
02:16:39,531 --> 02:16:40,520
Dead?

1356
02:16:56,347 --> 02:16:58,338
I can't see a dying man.

1357
02:17:32,684 --> 02:17:35,346
I fill up.
Meanwhile you change.

1358
02:18:38,583 --> 02:18:39,777
Do you think...

1359
02:18:44,022 --> 02:18:45,751
...that they'd let us alone?

1360
02:18:49,794 --> 02:18:51,318
Wherever we'd go...

1361
02:18:52,263 --> 02:18:54,254
...they will find and kill us.

1362
02:18:58,236 --> 02:18:59,225
Mirza!

1363
02:19:00,538 --> 02:19:01,527
Mirza!

1364
02:19:10,081 --> 02:19:11,070
Do you love me?

1365
02:19:13,051 --> 02:19:14,040
What?

1366
02:19:17,822 --> 02:19:19,187
Do you love me?

1367
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:24,187
Till the last breath.

1368
02:19:26,297 --> 02:19:27,423
You trust me?

1369
02:19:30,268 --> 02:19:31,599
More than the God.

1370
02:19:38,543 --> 02:19:40,135
I trust this.

1371
02:19:44,082 --> 02:19:46,175
Whoever comes between us...

1372
02:19:47,385 --> 02:19:49,478
...I shall shoot each of them.

1373
02:20:40,271 --> 02:20:41,636
Oh!
- What happen.

1374
02:20:48,379 --> 02:20:50,677
Will it work?
- I'll see.

1375
02:20:59,657 --> 02:21:01,420
Oh! Shit!

1376
02:21:03,628 --> 02:21:04,652
Is it a flat?

1377
02:21:07,632 --> 02:21:09,623
Yeah, that's why I've opened
the bonnet.

1378
02:21:38,663 --> 02:21:39,652
Let's go.

1379
02:26:19,210 --> 02:26:20,199
Kabi.

1380
02:26:25,483 --> 02:26:26,472
Mirza!

1381
02:26:29,253 --> 02:26:30,777
Please, let me talk.

1382
02:26:32,456 --> 02:26:34,321
It's no use talking to him.

1383
02:26:35,259 --> 02:26:36,419
At least let me try.

1384
02:26:40,031 --> 02:26:41,658
It's just a waste of time.

1385
02:26:42,433 --> 02:26:44,230
Mirza, please!
- Go try.

1386
02:26:50,775 --> 02:26:52,504
Kabi, I really love him.

1387
02:26:53,177 --> 02:26:54,508
I deeply love him.

1388
02:26:54,812 --> 02:26:56,473
What you think, it's nothing...

1389
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:04,750
If I wanted to shoot you...

1390
02:27:07,191 --> 02:27:10,354
...by now I would have done it.

1391
02:27:16,767 --> 02:27:18,496
You're Sahiba's brother.

1392
02:27:21,238 --> 02:27:23,035
So I am giving you one
last chance.

1393
02:27:38,055 --> 02:27:39,249
Come on, hit me!

1394
02:28:02,780 --> 02:28:04,179
Come on!
Get up!

1395
02:29:13,317 --> 02:29:14,306
Come on!

1396
02:29:59,230 --> 02:30:01,858
Come on! Come on!!
Get up!

1397
02:30:03,234 --> 02:30:04,166
Get up!

1398
02:32:03,687 --> 02:32:04,619
No!

1399
02:32:41,125 --> 02:32:42,786
Sahiba! Sahiba!

1400
02:32:44,061 --> 02:32:46,120
No! Leave me. \

1401
02:32:46,497 --> 02:32:48,089
What are you uttering, Sahiba?

1402
02:32:49,566 --> 02:32:50,692
Don't be mad!

1403
02:33:00,110 --> 02:33:01,577
Mir... Mirza!

1404
02:33:02,746 --> 02:33:03,735
Mirza!

1405
02:33:04,448 --> 02:33:06,712
Brother!
Brother, please!

1406
02:33:06,784 --> 02:33:09,446
Do you know, he killed Mac.

1407
02:33:18,095 --> 02:33:19,221
Why?

1408
02:33:20,130 --> 02:33:21,620
Why did you kill Mac?

1409
02:33:24,101 --> 02:33:25,534
Why did you kill Mac?

1410
02:33:26,503 --> 02:33:27,492
Look...

1411
02:33:27,805 --> 02:33:29,796
Look, Mac is still alive.

1412
02:33:30,274 --> 02:33:31,571
I did not kill Mac.

1413
02:33:31,709 --> 02:33:32,767
He is alive.

1414
02:33:37,781 --> 02:33:39,305
Mirza, I am sorry.

1415
02:33:39,516 --> 02:33:41,643
Nothing will happen.
Nothing will happen to you

1416
02:33:45,456 --> 02:33:47,048
I could have give died for you.

1417
02:33:47,558 --> 02:33:49,150
Or I could have killed you too.

1418
02:33:50,194 --> 02:33:51,286
You are mad.

1419
02:33:52,629 --> 02:33:55,120
Just once at least you
could asked and seen.

1420
02:33:55,566 --> 02:33:57,090
I am sorry.
- I'd have given my life.

1421
02:33:57,134 --> 02:34:00,103
So what was the need
to remove the bullets.

1422
02:34:01,171 --> 02:34:03,435
I'm sorry, Mirza.
I love you.

1423
02:34:04,341 --> 02:34:06,571
Mirza, nothing will happen to you.

1424
02:34:06,744 --> 02:34:09,212
Nothing will happen.
- I've not complains...

1425
02:34:09,713 --> 02:34:11,237
...that I will die.

1426
02:34:11,448 --> 02:34:13,006
I am just afraid...

1427
02:34:13,383 --> 02:34:16,147
...that lest people's faith
in love end.

1428
02:34:18,655 --> 02:34:21,055
Mirza, please!
No, Mirza.

1429
02:34:22,092 --> 02:34:25,027
I am sorry. I am really sorry.

1430
02:34:25,696 --> 02:34:27,323
Please get up.

1431
02:34:28,098 --> 02:34:30,032
Please stand up.

1432
02:34:31,401 --> 02:34:32,698
Please, brother!

1433
02:34:32,770 --> 02:34:35,364
Sahiba, come let's go.
- Please! Please!

1434
02:34:35,639 --> 02:34:37,038
Brother, please!

1435
02:34:39,376 --> 02:34:41,401
Sahiba! Come.
- Brother!

1436
02:34:42,646 --> 02:34:43,635
Come.

1437
02:34:47,151 --> 02:34:48,140
Mirza!

1438
02:34:49,219 --> 02:34:50,481
We'll meet again.

1439
02:34:51,755 --> 02:34:53,484
You were right in your place, Jeet.

1440
02:34:55,125 --> 02:34:57,093
You were right in your place.
- Mirza!

1441
02:34:59,163 --> 02:35:00,494
But regrettably...

1442
02:35:01,064 --> 02:35:02,827
...if sis-in-law too was
right in her place.

1443
02:35:28,458 --> 02:35:30,790
We shall certainly meet someday.

1444
02:35:32,062 --> 02:35:33,188
But not like this.

1445
02:35:34,064 --> 02:35:35,053
As brothers.

1446
02:35:35,132 --> 02:35:36,190
Mirza!

1447
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:37,494
Mirza!

1448
02:35:42,172 --> 02:35:44,299
Mirza!

1449
02:35:48,579 --> 02:35:49,568
Mirza!

1450
02:35:54,785 --> 02:35:57,652
I did not deceive you.

1451
02:36:00,190 --> 02:36:05,059
I am sorry... Mirza!

1452
02:36:21,144 --> 02:36:24,409
I am sorry... Mirza!
