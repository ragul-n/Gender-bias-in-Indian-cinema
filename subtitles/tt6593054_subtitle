1
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,875
<i>We have a very special guest tonight.</i>

2
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,791
<i>Please welcome Jatin Ahuja,
from Big Boy Toyz.</i>

3
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,666
Hey guys, welcome
to Big Boy Toyz: Drive Nights.

4
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,208
And now, it's time
for the last race of the night.

5
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,958
The winner will get half a million.

6
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,875
So are you guys ready?

7
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:40,791
Guri, cameras on!

8
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:50,625
<i>This race will start from India Gate,
go via Chattarpur</i>

9
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,000
<i>and will end in front of us
at this warehouse.</i>

10
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,083
<i>All the best!</i>

11
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,666
Three, two, one... Here we go!

12
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:37,791
It's difficult to say if you are more sexy
or your driving skills!

13
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,291
Let's have some champagne.

14
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:45,083
Popping champagne is for ordinary people.

15
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,875
<i>Karma</i>

16
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,875
<i>Karma</i>

17
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
<i>Karma</i>

18
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,625
<i>Karma</i>

19
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,416
<i>You walk with this swag
Without caring who you bump into</i>

20
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,208
<i>I was waiting for this moment
When you'd bump into me, hey!</i>

21
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:21,541
<i>You walk with this swag
Without caring who you bump into</i>

22
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:25,750
<i>I was waiting for this moment
When you'd bump into me</i>

23
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:30,125
<i>This attitude of yours
That the world revolves around you</i>

24
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,916
<i>Now you'll know soon
Why the world says</i>

25
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,333
<i>Karma is a bitch!</i>

26
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,708
<i>Karma is a bitch!</i>

27
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,625
<i>Karma is a bitch!</i>

28
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,166
<i>There will be no mercy
I swear by God</i>

29
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,250
<i>They call me Karma
and I'm that bitch!</i>

30
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,833
<i>Karma is a bitch!</i>

31
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,875
<i>You don't know</i>

32
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:11,958
<i>But Karma brings back around
What you throw around</i>

33
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:17,000
<i>If you'd been good
Then you wouldn't get screwed</i>

34
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,916
<i>But you just couldn't be respectful
No, no, no!</i>

35
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,166
<i>This attitude of yours
That the world revolves around you</i>

36
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,166
<i>Now you'll know soon
Why the world says</i>

37
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,958
<i>Karma is a bitch!</i>

38
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,083
<i>Karma is a bitch!</i>

39
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:41,000
<i>Karma is a bitch!</i>

40
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,291
<i>There will be no mercy
I swear by God</i>

41
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,166
<i>They call me Karma
and I'm that bitch!</i>

42
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,833
<i>Karma is a bitch!</i>

43
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:05,791
<i>Karma is a bitch!</i>

44
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,916
VIP gate check-in.

45
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,541
Sir, VIP gate check-in.

46
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,375
Ms. Vibha Singh, Director
of Monetary Restrictions Authority,

47
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,166
facial recognition confirmed.

48
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,541
Log entry route, please.

49
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,875
It's 10:15 a.m., parking, sub level two,

50
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,083
entering elevator 12.

51
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,666
Exiting into grand hall.

52
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,375
Okay, I'll have a word. I will.

53
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,708
- Hello, Mr. Singhania.
- Hello, Ms. Vibha.

54
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:25,791
- How are you?
- Fine.

55
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,166
Sorry for the delay.

56
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,375
Actually a new scam has surfaced,
I was stuck in its investigation.

57
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,708
- That's fine.
- Please come.

58
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,250
Mr. Singhania,
your business deals are all in cash.

59
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,666
So there's a lot of pressure
on me about your case.

60
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,625
I'm sure we can settle this
off the record.

61
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,500
- Of course.
- Good morning, ma'am.

62
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,083
That's why I made you an offer.

63
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,041
Trust me, online security is a myth...

64
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,416
Oh...

65
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,625
Sorry, sir.

66
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,458
Hey...

67
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,416
Cyber Crime?

68
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,708
- Take this.
- Sir, you've misunderstood...

69
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,750
- Come along.
- Sir...

70
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,000
Mr. Singhania, my offer is quite clear.

71
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,791
- You need a clean chit...
- Hello, Ms. Vibha.

72
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,000
...and for that I'm only asking for 40%.

73
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,583
And nowadays,
even Swiss banks are co-operating.

74
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,791
All that is okay, Ms. Vibha,
but a 40% share is too high.

75
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,958
It's too much for me.

76
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:27,958
Please come.

77
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:32,416
Mr. Singhania, please relax and think.
You have plenty of time...

78
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:39,166
- I didn't do anything, sir. No, please...
- Hamid.

79
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,541
- Scoundrel!
- Hamid!

80
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,458
Ma'am, it's you?

81
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,333
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

82
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,541
- This...
- Blood?

83
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,125
Not mine, his.

84
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,625
He's Industrialist Kumar's accountant.

85
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,791
A few more punches
and he'll spill all the details.

86
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:59,250
Then, you see, I'll make him pay
a 30% fine and 30% tax.

87
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,258
Then I'll set up such an inquiry
that even his forefathers will quiver.

88
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,833
- Hey. Speak up, now.
- No, sir...

89
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:07,791
So, Mr. Singhania...

90
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,250
- No, no, 40% is fine.
- Good.

91
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,916
Fine. I'll send it.

92
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,916
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

93
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,750
Sir... No, please.

94
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,958
Hamid, where did you find
Kumar's accountant?

95
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,708
Didn't he escape to Dubai?

96
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,500
Ma'am, this isn't Kumar's accountant.

97
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,166
- He's from Cyber Crime.
- Yes, ma'am.

98
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,500
Cyber Crime?

99
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:32,041
Yeah, I thought Singhania should see
what happens if he doesnâ€™t pay us.

100
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,166
I couldn't find any accountant type.

101
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,875
I bumped into this idiot,

102
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,083
so I picked him up.

103
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,416
Accounts guys and cyber employees
all look the same, don't they?

104
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,000
- Want to go?
- Yes, sir!

105
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,541
Go, go.

106
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,458
- Hey, shut the door.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,625
Yes.

108
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,041
Did Singhania agree?

109
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,875
After seeing you,
even I would have agreed to pay 40%.

110
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,708
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Ms. Vibha, please hold.</i>

111
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,875
<i>The Prime Minister
would like to talk to you.</i>

112
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,375
The Prime Minister... okay.

113
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:07,375
<i>Hello, Ms. Vibha, this is Kirit Ojha,</i>

114
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,333
<i>Special Operational Secretary
to the Prime Minister.</i>

115
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,250
<i>I'm sorry, he had to rush for a meeting,</i>

116
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,708
<i>but he needs your help
with a personal matter.</i>

117
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,250
My help?

118
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,958
<i>I'm sending my guy to you.</i>

119
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,000
<i>He is Irfan. He'll give you the details.</i>

120
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,375
- Okay, but...
<i>- Thank you very much, Ms. Vibha.</i>

121
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,541
The Prime Minister's per...

122
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,166
Hello, ma'am.

123
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:36,916
Hello.

124
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,625
I'm Irfan. The Prime Minister sent me.

125
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,958
This is Hamid, the senior-most officer
in my department.

126
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,125
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
can we sit, please?

127
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,166
Shut the door.

128
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,875
Now, please tell me.

129
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,458
Three nights back,

130
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:09,208
about 660 pounds of gold bars were stolen
from Mehta & Mehta jewelers.

131
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,250
Boss? He's arrived.

132
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,916
He's here alone.

133
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,916
<i>Good. As soon as he comes out
with the gold, catch him.</i>

134
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,541
- And the gold...
<i>- One minute...</i>

135
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,666
- These guys were not with the thief?
- No.

136
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,791
A different gang.

137
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,791
I think this thief must have spoilt
some plan of theirs

138
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,708
and these guys were there to avenge that.

139
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,041
Then?

140
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,000
Then the thief did something...

141
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,833
that no thief must have ever done.

142
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,416
Boss, he's set off the alarm.

143
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,041
Why did he set off the alarm?

144
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:28,166
Because the alarm immediately sends
an alert to Mr. Mehta.

145
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:32,416
<i>And secondly, also informs
the nearest police station about it.</i>

146
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,416
Go, go!

147
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,083
Hurry up!

148
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,041
Go inside. Grab him and take him with us.

149
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,166
Put your hands up!

150
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:18,416
Don't move! Hands up!

151
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,291
Despite the police,
how did the thief rob the gold?

152
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,083
To steal from the vault,
he needed two things.

153
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:32,375
An entry for his gang members
to carry the 660 pounds of gold bars...

154
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,791
<i>And second, the key to open the vault,</i>

155
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,500
<i>which he got by setting off the alarm.</i>

156
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,166
<i>The police station alarm
was intercepted and diverted.</i>

157
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,000
<i>They never got this alert.</i>

158
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,041
Who is this thief?

159
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:01,875
<i>The King.</i>

160
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,125
The King leaves a card
at his every robbery.

161
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:35,750
And behind that card, he tells us
where his next robbery will be.

162
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,375
When he stole diamonds from Surat,

163
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,291
he left behind the card
of the Bangalore museum.

164
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,791
In the museum, he left behind
Mehta jewelers' card.

165
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,375
And the card that he left behind there...

166
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:49,916
was this.

167
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,958
His next robbery will be here.

168
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:56,708
But this is...

169
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,250
Yes, Ma'am.

170
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,625
The Presidential Palace.

171
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,625
But that's impossible.

172
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,583
Okay.

173
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,750
I'm sure that the Prime Minister
will feel very secure when I tell him that

174
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:27,625
"Ms. Vibha says 'that's impossible.'"

175
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,458
Sorry for wasting your time.

176
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,291
Mr. Irfan, I can understand.

177
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,500
You tell me what want me to do,
and I'll handle it.

178
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,125
Thank you.

179
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,791
Mr. Mehta's gold
was bought with black money.

180
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,666
And black money
is your department's jurisdiction.

181
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:52,541
Mr. Ojha thinks that my investigation
should happen from your department,

182
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,041
so that no one knows what's happening.

183
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,416
Were any leads recovered
from Mr. Mehta's place?

184
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,791
Any CCTV footage, any fingerprints?

185
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,041
- No.
- No?

186
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,333
But we found tire marks
that belong to the cars of the other gang.

187
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,791
Tire marks?

188
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:11,958
These are special tread tires
that are usually used for racing.

189
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,708
Oh... racing?

190
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,458
Street racing.

191
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:36,583
Sir, the tire marks that you found
match the car of that girl.

192
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,208
Her name is Tara and she is the owner
of a local courier company.

193
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,375
A local courier makes so much money?

194
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,708
Sir, this is a different kind of courier.

195
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,708
Smugglers, businessmen, black marketers...

196
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,916
Anyone wanting to transport their goods
use the services of her company.

197
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,583
She has a lot of people in her gang,
but she only trusts two.

198
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,666
One is that guy. His name is Bikki.

199
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,291
He's a fixer.

200
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,625
Be it cars or electronics,
he can fix anything.

201
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,000
He has one bad habit...

202
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,125
Gambling.

203
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,333
And the second
is Bikki's girlfriend, Naina.

204
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,250
From fake passports to fake ID cards,

205
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,500
she can forge anything.

206
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,958
Her side-business
is making pirated watches.

207
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,980
Over half of the pirated watches
on the market are made by her.

208
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,875
Hamid, this very girl is after the King.

209
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,958
And only she can lead us to him.

210
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,208
Our guy will have to infiltrate her gang.

211
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,250
I've tried a lot, sir. This girl
doesn't trust anyone just like that.

212
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,583
There is one guy...

213
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,916
who can win this girl's trust.

214
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,875
Arjun.

215
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Congratulations.

216
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,916
But you won the race.

217
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,083
Yeah, that's true.
But everyone is still cheering for you.

218
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,416
Nice!

219
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,916
Hey, brother, what driving!

220
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,291
You left everyone behind.

221
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,500
You're definitely confirmed
on Tara's team.

222
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,791
Come, let's meet everyone.

223
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,208
Bikki, my boyfriend.

224
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,291
- What's up?
- Minor dent on the hood.

225
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,208
- All okay?
- Yes, it's okay.

226
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,125
Baby, he just bought
two watches from me today.

227
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,000
That watch is fake.

228
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,375
Bullshit. It's original.
I got it from the store myself.

229
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,750
May I? Thank you.

230
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,583
Get a refund.

231
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,708
This has 36 diamonds
and the original has 39.

232
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,166
Also, the diamond quality is...

233
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,625
not so good.

234
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,625
Unbelievable! Keep your crap.

235
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,666
My guy will collect the cash tomorrow.

236
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,208
Thanks, dude.

237
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,916
You think you're so smart. Yeah?

238
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,916
Yeah, I am... about a few things.

239
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,208
Chill, boys!

240
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:49,833
Hello.

241
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,958
You do a nice burnout.

242
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:55,625
But I've not seen you here before.

243
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,750
Actually, I'm a Formula One test driver.

244
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:03,166
I heard that you
drive these toys fast and call it racing,

245
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:04,875
so came to take a look.

246
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,041
You think you can beat us
in a street race?

247
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,541
Yeah.

248
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,166
Guys, listen to this!

249
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,541
This is a Formula One test driver

250
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,666
who says that he can beat us
in a street race.

251
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:27,666
Yeah.

252
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,666
Hey, a race can be won
by a one-second margin.

253
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,625
I'll beat you by a margin
of more than one minute.

254
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,291
You want to bet for 50,000?

255
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:41,000
If you're so confident then why 50,000?
Let's bet for half a million.

256
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,583
In fact, you choose the car for me.

257
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:51,833
Let's go.

258
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:53,916
Keys?

259
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Nice car!

260
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,875
You wish!

261
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Excuse me?

262
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Three...

263
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,500
two...

264
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:20,583
one... Go!

265
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,083
Come on!

266
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,916
Stop. Slow down. Hey, stop!

267
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,791
In a hurry, are you?

268
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,583
Show me the papers. Open the door.

269
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:57,708
Open up.

270
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:02,666
Have you been drinking?
Shut the engine and show the car papers.

271
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,285
- I don't have them.
- Sir, he doesn't have any papers.

272
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:13,666
Modified, is it?

273
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,958
Oh, look who's back.

274
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,875
It seems cops let you go pretty quickly!

275
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:31,708
What are the odds?

276
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,875
Pink is his daughter's favorite color.

277
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,208
So I gave him the car. And he let me go.

278
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,958
What the hell do you mean,
"gave him the car?" That was my car.

279
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,083
- Was it?
- Okay, listen...

280
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:45,625
Until you get back the car
and return the half million,

281
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,708
I own you.

282
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,250
Got it?

283
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,625
Is that a camera?

284
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,583
Works? Thanks.

285
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,083
Where the hell do you think you're going?

286
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,541
What is he up to?

287
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,125
<i>Sir, I needed to make an urgent call.</i>

288
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,791
But my battery has died.

289
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,125
I need to call Mom.
Can I borrow your phone, sir?

290
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,125
Yes, sure. Here you go.

291
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,333
One minute, I'm right here.

292
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,875
- That's fine.
- Thank you, sir.

293
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:37,458
Poor guy has to call his mom.
Looks troubled.

294
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,750
I told him, "Come home,
I'll teach you a lesson."

295
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,833
Correct.

296
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,541
Tell me, what should I have done?

297
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,083
Hello.

298
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,333
<i>- Is that Rathore, sir?
- </i>Yes, speaking.

299
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,863
I'm calling from<i> Dainik Bhaskar.</i>

300
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,291
<i>I wanted your comment</i>

301
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,791
<i>- on the anti-corruption raid at your home.</i>
- What?

302
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,583
<i>There has been no raid here.</i>

303
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,625
Sir, we have a confirmed report.

304
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,333
Listen, I'm an honest officer.
Understand? My record is clean.

305
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,500
We have a confirmed report
that you took a bribe from a boy.

306
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:11,583
A Tata Nano car.

307
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:12,916
What color was it?

308
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:14,541
Pink! Pink!

309
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,375
Sir, a pink color Tata Nano car.

310
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:21,000
<i>Along with that, a lot of cash,
jewelry and watches</i>

311
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,083
<i>were also confiscated from your house.</i>

312
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,000
<i>So would you like to make a comment?</i>

313
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,083
Hey...

314
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,833
Hey!

315
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,458
<i>I think the raid hasn't happened yet.</i>

316
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:31,791
Cut, cut, cut...

317
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,291
<i>Hello? It was a mistake, sir.</i>

318
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:39,791
Put it in. Fast.

319
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,000
If the raid happens,
not a cent will be left.

320
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:44,708
In the bag, quickly.

321
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,375
The watches as well. Put it inside.

322
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,083
Come. Let's go.

323
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,750
The gate. Open the gate.

324
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:11,625
Scoundrel, you want a comment?
I'll give you a comment.

325
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,666
Pick up the phone. Pick up, scoundrel!

326
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,375
Yes, sir.

327
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,708
Hey... you?

328
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:23,000
Hey! Stop! Hey!

329
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,666
Stop, you scoundrel!

330
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,000
You bloody...

331
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,250
Damn!

332
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:52,291
It's probably more than half a million,

333
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:53,958
but it's okay.

334
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,208
Oh, by the way,

335
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,708
nobody owns me.

336
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,333
Nobody.

337
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,083
What do you mean, "just met her?"

338
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,708
You were sent undercover,
not to romance her.

339
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:14,791
Now, find out quickly what she knows
about the King. That's it! Fast!

340
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:16,625
You talk to him.

341
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:20,791
Mr. Irfan, why have you got stuck
in this undercover officer's mess?

342
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:23,416
It's the digital era, now.
You do one thing...

343
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,000
- One minute. Hamid?
- Ma'am?

344
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,083
Do one thing.

345
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:27,958
Send Tara and her friends' e-mails,

346
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:31,333
bank accounts and credit card details
to Cyber Cell.

347
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:32,875
No, ma'am, that is impossible.

348
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,041
They will become official records.

349
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:37,166
Look, Hamid, do nothing of the sort.

350
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,083
Keep it quiet.

351
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:41,083
Relax, we'll think of something else.
A different idea?

352
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:43,416
Let's go. We'll find some other way.

353
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,458
I'm sure we'll find a way.

354
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:47,083
- Hey.
- Sorry, sir.

355
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:49,500
I'm not Mr. Kumar's accountant.
My name is Raj, sir.

356
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:52,666
I know, kid. I know everything.
You're from the CCD, right?

357
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,750
CCD, sir?

358
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,333
- Cyber Crime Department.
- Cyber Crime. Yes, sir.

359
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:59,083
- Here, do one thing. Take this.
- Sir.

360
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:02,541
I need all their details,
e-mail ID, phone, everything.

361
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:03,541
Got it?

362
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,041
Sir, I'll talk to my senior...

363
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,333
Hey!

364
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:08,083
Mr. Irfan, let him do it.

365
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:12,500
We also have our ways
of handling the black-money holders.

366
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,583
I don't want it on-record.
You do it off-records.

367
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:19,750
- Got it?
- Sir, off-records will be difficult...

368
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:21,500
You were hurt here that day, right?

369
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,375
- Sir, it'll be done.
- Right? Very good.

370
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:32,750
Come to the office
where you were beaten up, okay?

371
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,125
The call was not traceable.

372
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,333
- Keep at it.
- Okay.

373
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:58,833
I've checked everywhere,

374
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,375
but there's nothing on this King.

375
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,625
Do one thing.

376
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:09,041
Find out where has he hidden
the gold that he stole from Mehta's.

377
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,333
Once we grab that

378
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,500
he'll come to us himself.

379
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,791
Hey, guys, did you see my iPad somewhere?

380
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,750
No.

381
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:29,291
No talking on the phone from today.

382
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,208
If you need to tell me anything,
you know the code.

383
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,833
Okay, let me show you
a card trick of mine.

384
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,166
- Okay.
- All right.

385
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,375
- Come on.
- Your card... king.

386
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:54,250
That's my card?

387
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,333
Give me your hand.

388
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
That's it.

389
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,416
This is mine.

390
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,416
I get a queen.

391
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
- Are you ready?
- Okay.

392
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,375
Yeah? Let's do this.

393
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,250
Well, check the card now.

394
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,708
Where is it?

395
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,916
Where did it go? Where is it?

396
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,500
Where is the king?

397
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:22,250
- Your card was to get replaced...
- But where is the king?

398
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,625
Joker?

399
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,416
That is your card, right?

400
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,958
But where did the king card go?

401
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,041
Right in front of you.

402
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,375
That was... really cool.

403
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:03,875
Where did you learn that?

404
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,416
From my ex-husband.

405
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:12,208
He impressed me
with these kind of card tricks.

406
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,000
Soon, we were dating.

407
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:21,458
And he made me feel like
all his time and attention was just mine.

408
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,000
In some time, we also got married.

409
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,000
And some time later...

410
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,083
he disappeared.

411
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,791
He had taken loans of millions in my name.

412
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,458
I was to be arrested.

413
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:46,666
I had to change my name
and my whole identity to escape.

414
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:49,583
I lost everything.

415
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,416
And was left just with these card tricks.

416
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,500
It's a good trick, at least.

417
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:07,166
It was.

418
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:23,625
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Tel Aviv, Israel.</i>

419
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,083
Sir, I've checked everything.

420
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:28,208
But apart from racing, shopping
and partying, they don't do anything.

421
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,250
Anything from the phone tapping?

422
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,041
No, sir. They are together
all day long, anyway.

423
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,000
Just keep forwarding messages
to each other.

424
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:38,875
Keep looking.

425
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:40,625
What a bore.

426
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,375
What happened? Girlfriend trouble?
Here, I'll handle her.

427
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,458
No, sir. It's a marketing message.

428
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:50,458
"Call to check your future,"
and such type...

429
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,750
Marketing messages have viruses in them.

430
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,791
So I delete
without even opening them. Yes, sir.

431
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:00,708
How can they tell your future, anyway?
That's in my hands.

432
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,458
That's it!

433
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,916
No one looks at marketing messages.

434
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:10,625
These people are talking to each other
via marketing messages.

435
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,625
Come on. I want to see all the messages.

436
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,666
<i>Bikki gets weight loss, card bills,
electronics, gadgets.</i>

437
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,625
Naina gets gym membership discount,
share market messages.

438
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:00,625
Samar and Tara get fashion
and property investment messages.

439
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,875
This means, there's nothing here.

440
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:08,541
- No, you can't trust him.
- Hey, what's up, guys?

441
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:11,875
Guess what?
I'm going to propose to her today.

442
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:16,166
- Seriously? Congratulations!
- No, no. Are you mad?

443
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:20,166
He's already proposed to her twice
and she said no both times.

444
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:21,416
No.

445
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,458
- She didn't say no.
- What's wrong with you?

446
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,916
She said, "let's get settled,
then we'll get married."

447
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:27,416
Just a minute.

448
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:47,041
Guys, I'm a little tired.
Let's meet tomorrow.

449
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:49,333
- But you were going to propose.
- Yeah, but...

450
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:52,041
Actually, I should go too.
Just drop me on the way.

451
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,541
Okay. Bye.

452
00:39:58,166 --> 00:39:59,166
Bye.

453
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:03,291
Sir...

454
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:07,333
Hey, come here. What is it?

455
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,333
What is it?

456
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:12,833
Sir, actually, they received
this message a few minutes back.

457
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:15,458
Oh, just what we needed.

458
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:16,875
A poem!

459
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:27,541
Is this a poem?

460
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:29,208
One should shoot such poets.

461
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,458
- Sir, actually...
- A poem?

462
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:32,708
Sir, it isn't...

463
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,750
This isn't a poem. It's a coded message.

464
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:37,250
- It's railcode.
- What?

465
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:38,333
That's right. Come.

466
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,208
We'll get the location too with this code.

467
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:43,083
Instead of modern coding,
they're using old coding.

468
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,791
That's smart, very smart.

469
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,625
Sir, what's this "petticoat"?

470
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:50,500
Not "petticoat," railcode!

471
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:51,916
Sir, this <i>kafir</i> is a code?

472
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,583
Write the first letters
of the poem in a line.

473
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,000
G-Y-exclamation mark.

474
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:06,125
Rail line. Ma'am...

475
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,541
- Right.
- One line.

476
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:08,625
Second line.

477
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:10,541
And this coding system.

478
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:12,708
Now connect them.

479
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:20,458
- "King's gold..."
- K-A...

480
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:23,916
Very good. You're a genius.
You cracked it.

481
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,958
Sir, I got the location
of the King's gold.

482
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,125
Gopiganj police station. Yes!

483
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,041
Ojha, sir?

484
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,458
We need a rapid response team.
And really fast.

485
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:48,166
Entry permits? Vibha ma'am will organize.

486
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,500
- Okay.
- Yeah, it will be done.

487
00:41:57,666 --> 00:42:00,625
Hamid, tell the undercover agent
to be prepared.

488
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:04,000
However fast they drive today,

489
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:06,875
they won't escape us.

490
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,333
Guys...

491
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,333
there's nothing here.

492
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:31,708
Totally empty.

493
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,500
- Seems the King moved Mehta's gold.
- Shit!

494
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:36,916
He must have shifted it.

495
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:40,125
But how can he always
be one step ahead of us?

496
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:44,041
But he must have hidden it close by.
We have to look for it!

497
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,500
But this is Gopiganj police station.
It should be here.

498
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,666
Yeah, but it could be somewhere close by.

499
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:44,125
Wha...

500
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,791
What are you doing? Follow them!

501
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,583
Go right!

502
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:40,958
Hit him!

503
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:57,875
Sir, they're escaping.
When will your guy come?

504
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,625
Hamid... Move.

505
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:03,541
Okay, sir. Okay.

506
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,750
Guys, who is this?

507
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:13,666
Let's get them, Arjun.

508
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:31,958
Son of a bitch!

509
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:33,291
Guys, fast! Move!

510
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,708
Get into the service lane.

511
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:44,625
Guys, block him!

512
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,541
Watch out!

513
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:10,750
<i>Quick, boost now!</i>

514
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,750
Make sure all the exits are blocked.
Hamid, do you copy?

515
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,583
Okay, sir, okay. Copy, sir.

516
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,916
- Block all highway exits.
- Okay, sir, copy!

517
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,250
Let's take the next exit.

518
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,166
Damn!

519
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Watch out!

520
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,083
They've blocked all exits.

521
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:56,083
<i>You all know where to meet, right?</i>

522
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,833
Guys, split up.

523
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,500
All guards stay with them.

524
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,708
Let's go, let's go!

525
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:12,166
That side.

526
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:15,000
- One team, check that side.
- Okay, sir.

527
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:17,333
- That way, left and ahead also.
- Okay, sir.

528
00:48:17,416 --> 00:48:18,333
Left side.

529
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:19,791
Sir, they escaped.

530
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,916
This is even better, Hamid.

531
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:26,291
They left the King's gold and ran away.

532
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:28,696
Now he'll come to us on his own.

533
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:05,750
<i>This girl doesn't trust just anyone.</i>

534
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:10,125
There is one guy
who can win this girl's trust.

535
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:12,166
<i>Arjun.</i>

536
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:40,958
No one steals my stuff from me.

537
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:44,833
You're the King.

538
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,791
Guys, where are you all?

539
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,250
We've reached it.

540
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:08,125
- Come on, Let's start the races.
- Look at your faces. Wow!

541
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:11,125
Boom. It's a fake. Sorry.

542
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,333
You guys got my gold seized.
It's for that.

543
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:14,416
You...

544
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,708
If you're the King, then why
did you come to us on your own?

545
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:26,375
To figure out why your guys
were after me at the jewelry store.

546
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:28,125
Okay, wait.

547
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:30,750
How did you know that we were after you?

548
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,166
Take this...

549
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,666
I told you not to take him.

550
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:42,708
Guys...

551
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,250
now my question.

552
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,583
Can we go in some other car, buddy?

553
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:50,833
I don't fit in this, buddy.

554
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:55,041
- Here?
- Yeah, much better.

555
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:56,708
I'll adjust.

556
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:58,916
- You guys please continue talking.
- Thanks.

557
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,458
We were after you

558
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:03,916
because we want to steal something
for which we need your help.

559
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:09,083
Everyone knows the King doesn't work
with anyone but his own people.

560
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,083
Right.

561
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:13,125
So we thought, if we could
steal your gold from you,

562
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:17,708
maybe you would be impressed
and help us out.

563
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,250
You want the King's help?

564
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,250
Great.

565
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:31,791
Guys, you've done so much
to find the King, so...

566
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:34,458
I also need to be honest.

567
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,458
I'm not the real King.

568
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:39,208
What?

569
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:40,375
Yeah.

570
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:42,416
No, I did all those robberies.

571
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,708
But I leave the King's name behind

572
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:48,166
so that the cops go after him,
and I just have fun.

573
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:50,583
Cool, no?

574
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:53,208
- Yeah? No?
- I'm gonna kill you!

575
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:54,875
Stop! Let go of him!

576
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:01,375
And just so you know, the robberies
that impressed you so much...

577
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:03,250
I did those, not the King.

578
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:04,666
Please!

579
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,625
They got to us because of you.

580
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,625
Got to us? What nonsense!

581
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:11,250
No one knows about me.

582
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:12,666
And that Arjun?

583
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:17,000
- What?
- He's an undercover police officer.

584
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:21,125
He also found out about us, like you did,

585
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,750
and now he's looking for the King here.

586
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,083
- No, no!
- Hear us out first.

587
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:27,000
Relax.

588
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:29,416
He knows nothing about us.
I've handled it.

589
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:31,791
Then how did he seize the gold?

590
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,625
He didn't seize the gold.
We ensured it got seized.

591
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:39,625
Ensured, how?

592
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,958
The Director of Monetary Restrictions
Authority, Ms. Vibha Singh

593
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:49,125
takes a 40% share
of businessmen's black money

594
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:50,708
and gives them a clean chit.

595
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,208
And she has hidden her money in a place

596
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:56,208
from where no one
would even think of stealing it.

597
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,375
What place is that?

598
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,208
The Presidential Palace.

599
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,500
You're joking, right?

600
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,166
<i>We let the gold be seized</i>

601
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:27,500
<i>because we knew she won't be able
to resist after seeing so much gold.</i>

602
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:28,958
<i>She'll keep it.</i>

603
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:35,208
<i>Forge the warehouse papers and declare
only 66 pounds as seized gold.</i>

604
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:36,875
<i>The rest goes into my room.</i>

605
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:41,750
Greed is a sin.

606
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:48,541
<i>When the British built the Palace,
they added secret tunnels and chambers.</i>

607
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,375
<i>But to this day,
no one knows their locations.</i>

608
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:55,375
<i>Singh found one such place.</i>

609
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:06,500
<i>Now she hides all her money
in this secret chamber.</i>

610
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,416
<i>Unfortunately, that secret chamber</i>

611
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,666
<i>is at the center
of the Presidential Palace.</i>

612
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:26,208
Again, how much money is there?

613
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:28,625
Oh...

614
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:34,041
Only... 8.9 billion.

615
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:38,375
<i>The Presidential Palace.</i>

616
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,833
<i>There are only three ways to get inside.</i>

617
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:43,875
<i>First, the employee entrance
in the North block.</i>

618
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:46,125
<i>Second, the service entrance</i>

619
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:48,250
<i>in the North block basement parking.</i>

620
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:51,666
<i>And third, the visitor entrance
to the South block.</i>

621
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,541
<i>All three entrances are guarded
by heavily-armed CRPF soldiers.</i>

622
00:54:57,041 --> 00:55:01,583
<i>The main building has 340 rooms
and 1.5 miles of corridors.</i>

623
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,083
<i>A special protection group
handles its security.</i>

624
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,166
<i>They've been given permission</i>

625
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,083
<i>to shoot-on-sight
if they're even slightly suspicious.</i>

626
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:14,458
<i>Not just that:
the main security control room</i>

627
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:16,375
<i>monitors the whole Palace</i>

628
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:19,750
<i>through a network of 7200 CCTV cameras.</i>

629
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:23,416
<i>The control room is equipped
with facial recognition software</i>

630
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,666
<i>that can identify anybody
within one minute.</i>

631
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:31,500
I'm thinking we should go in through
the service entrance. But let's see.

632
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:33,750
Shall we start?

633
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:34,833
Yes.

634
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,958
So, there is 8.9 billion
in the Palace's secret chamber.

635
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:43,083
And this secret chamber
is two levels below

636
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:46,666
the artifact restoration room
connected to the Palace's museum.

637
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:50,291
We'll get only one chance
to steal this money.

638
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:54,583
And that's why we have to steal it
seven days from today.

639
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:57,208
It's the annual day
of all the security forces.

640
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:58,291
Seven days?

641
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:00,083
So, that day, the Palace is shut.

642
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,208
And a lunch will be organized

643
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:04,958
for both the security forces
in the Mughal gardens that day.

644
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:09,333
Then, for half an hour, there will be
no security guards in the Palace.

645
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:10,458
Only two.

646
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:13,625
They will be watching
the CCTV in the main control room.

647
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:16,583
And that day, we'll enter the Palace

648
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:19,250
posing as workers
of the restoration department.

649
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:20,916
Why the restoration department?

650
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:22,916
Because when the Palace is shut,

651
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:26,708
only the restoration department workers
are given a permit.

652
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:30,791
But the problem is that for this permit,
the restoration department

653
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:33,625
has to get clearance
from 64 departments and submit it

654
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,708
to the scheduling department
of the Palace.

655
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:36,791
So just to get in,

656
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,500
we have to get clearance
from 64 departments?

657
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:40,916
Yeah.

658
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:43,208
And that, too, in just seven days?

659
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:47,166
Actually,
we have to do all this in one day.

660
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:49,083
That's not possible.

661
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,125
But...

662
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:43,041
It's the first time your department
has given complete paperwork.

663
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:44,625
I just have one request.

664
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:47,958
Please finish in half a day.
A conference is scheduled in the hall.

665
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:50,250
High profile businessmen are expected.

666
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:54,500
So ma'am, we'll need the space
an hour before to clean up.

667
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:58,583
Don't worry.
Our work will be done by then.

668
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:03,666
Now the most important part of the job.

669
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,458
Our exit route.

670
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,708
And to figure that out,
you two will go the Palace tomorrow.

671
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:09,791
You...

672
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,125
will pose as a worker
of the<i> Last Wish Foundation.</i>

673
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:16,416
When you two go there, the CRPF
will not allow you inside

674
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,333
because your paperwork will be incomplete.

675
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:21,041
What do you mean, incomplete?

676
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:27,791
After some time,
you will ask to meet this man.

677
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:30,333
Retired Colonel Khurana,
Public Relations Officer.

678
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:34,000
He will clear your entry
and directly meet you in the museum.

679
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:37,083
Why will he allow them inside
without paperwork?

680
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:42,250
Because who doesn't want to grant
the last wish of a dying man?

681
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:49,500
Ms. Garima, please don't worry at all.
Please come.

682
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:52,916
Sorry that our paperwork wasn't correct.

683
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:57,083
We actually have very few volunteers
atthe <i>Last Wish Foundation.</i>

684
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,250
Oh, worry not!

685
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:00,958
So we are very busy... A lot of work...

686
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,083
Is that Bittu?

687
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,750
Bittu has a very rare disease.

688
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:10,208
When we asked him his last wish,

689
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,166
he said he wanted to see
the Presidential Palace.

690
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,791
Will you grant his last wish?

691
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:22,458
- Yes, come. Let's start here.
- Let's go.

692
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:51,125
Great. So now, the CCTV cameras.

693
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:52,708
To evade them...

694
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:55,708
Don't worry about the CCTV cameras.
I've got that covered.

695
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,333
When we plug this into the Palace's system
we'll have full control over every camera.

696
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,083
Where did you get that?

697
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:07,791
I have a contact. You don't know him.

698
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:10,916
What?

699
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,375
Nothing.

700
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:15,541
By the way, what do I have to do tomorrow?

701
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,833
We have to go and mark the exit route.

702
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,250
Mark, how?

703
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,625
The Palace measures 300,000 square feet

704
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:26,083
with 1.5 miles of corridors and 350 rooms.

705
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,541
After the robbery,
if we take one wrong turn,

706
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,666
we end up in the Prime Minister's office
instead of the basement parking.

707
01:00:33,541 --> 01:00:35,875
So we have to mark the exact exit route.

708
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,875
And for that,
you will go there tomorrow as a tourist.

709
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:43,750
At the entry, they'll take your photo
and upload it to the central database.

710
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:48,125
Once you get clearance,
you'll be given a blue ID like this.

711
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,458
There are GPS trackers on visitor IDs

712
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:55,916
so that the control room guards
can monitor your movements.

713
01:00:57,041 --> 01:00:59,416
So first, you'll have
to hide it somewhere.

714
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:03,208
Then you'll wear
this fake red employee ID,

715
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:06,666
go meet the admin head, Mr. Kumar,
and get our entry cleared.

716
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:09,666
And remember, this red one is a fake ID,

717
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,083
so stay away from the guards.

718
01:01:12,166 --> 01:01:15,083
They have permission
to shoot-on-sight. I know...

719
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,250
Just a minute.

720
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:22,041
So tomorrow, we go to the Palace
and mark the corridors with spray paint,

721
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,958
in front of the guards...

722
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,750
visible on CCTV...

723
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:30,666
and no one will stop us?

724
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:41,541
Yeah.

725
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Yeah!

726
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:45,833
Cool.

727
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,750
Kumar, sir.

728
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:01,416
Here, some sweetmeats.

729
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,916
My sister got married.

730
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:07,916
Oh, you didn't recognize me? Sorry.

731
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,291
I'm Alisha. Alisha Malik.

732
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:12,125
From Accounts.

733
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:15,750
Oh, yes, from Accounts. Congratulations.

734
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:17,750
- From accounts...
- Thank you.

735
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,333
Go, come back later.

736
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,875
Let me feed you myself.

737
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,208
A big one?

738
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:31,958
I like big ones.

739
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:34,125
Naughty, sir.

740
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:36,083
Okay.

741
01:02:43,666 --> 01:02:44,666
Go on then.

742
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:47,375
Phone.

743
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,250
Work first, right, sir?

744
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:51,083
One minute.

745
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,541
- Hello?
- Victory to India!

746
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:57,541
Sir, I'm calling from the North block
parking, gate number three.

747
01:02:57,625 --> 01:02:58,500
Yes, speak.

748
01:02:58,583 --> 01:03:01,041
<i>Sir, a vehicle has arrived,
a garbage truck...</i>

749
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:04,416
Garbage truck? I haven't given
clearance to any garbage truck.

750
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,916
He says you gave permission.

751
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,958
<i>We don't have any papers regarding this.</i>

752
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,333
What papers?
Which gate are you calling from?

753
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:12,333
<i>Gate three, sir. We haven't received...</i>

754
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:13,666
Oh, so sorry, sir.

755
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:14,625
It's okay.

756
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,625
I dropped the sweets on your papers.

757
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:18,750
- One minute...
- It's an important permit.

758
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,291
Yes, I have the paper.

759
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:26,291
Sir, can I let him in, then?

760
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:28,500
Yes, let him in. I'll send you the papers.

761
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:25,708
- Lock down the Palace immediately.
- Yes, sir.

762
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,291
<i>All visitors and staff,</i>

763
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,458
<i>please assemble
in the Grand Hall immediately.</i>

764
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,291
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

765
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:34,750
<i>I repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

766
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:36,416
Hey, what's going on here?

767
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,666
This is the King! I'm sure of it.

768
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,166
These are rats.

769
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,333
Idiot! Where did the rats
come from suddenly?

770
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:49,333
Go to the control room
and check who has entered

771
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:51,851
from the service entry and the parking
in the last 20 minutes.

772
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:52,875
Move it!

773
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,291
Remote lock museum doors.

774
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:56,541
Yes, sir.

775
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:02,583
Check every employee
and visitor's ID again.

776
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:05,708
Sir, the Pest Control Department
is on site.

777
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:08,541
- Give complete access to Pest Control.
- Yes, sir.

778
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:47,208
Sir, the Pest Control team
wants to go into the museum.

779
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,500
Give them access.

780
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:06,916
Yes, I'm just checking. One minute..

781
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,875
- Show the footage of the parking.
- One minute sir, it's loading.

782
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,250
Stop! Rewind it!

783
01:06:12,916 --> 01:06:15,708
- Yes, sir.
- Why has the timer stopped on this one?

784
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:16,958
Rewind it. Stop.

785
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:18,375
Show me that.

786
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:22,791
Sir, this camera seems to be on a loop.

787
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:58,166
How do we take the cash out, now?

788
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,916
Exit the way you came in! Go!

789
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:10,375
Hello? What are you all doing here?

790
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:11,583
Show me your IDs.

791
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:14,125
Sir, hold your breath.
We just sprayed a deadly poison.

792
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:16,375
Please wear this. Come this way.

793
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:17,458
Get out of here.

794
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,875
Come on. Let's go, sir.

795
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,500
Wait.

796
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,250
Sir, four Pest Control personnel

797
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:59,208
in the museum's restoration room
are not traceable.

798
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:00,583
Check all CCTV cameras.

799
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,500
Stop, please.

800
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:29,125
Scan her ID.

801
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:30,208
Yes, sir.

802
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,208
<i>And remember this red employee ID is fake.</i>

803
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:51,000
Scan it again.

804
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:55,875
I have my ID in my office.
I've called for it.

805
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,666
Raj, check whose ID got rejected just now.

806
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:16,000
Background check required.
Employee ID 1728.

807
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:18,833
Sir...

808
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:20,500
One minute...

809
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:23,541
Ask her to lift her veil.

810
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:25,078
Madam, please lift the veil.

811
01:09:27,791 --> 01:09:29,041
Madam, show your face.

812
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,250
Match the face.

813
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:41,583
Sir, please keep moving.

814
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:44,166
He's getting my ID.

815
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:49,041
Detain her.

816
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:50,625
Sir, 30 more seconds.

817
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:52,875
Not me! Detain her.

818
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:11,208
Hey, what was the name
of the girl who was right here?

819
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,166
A lady named Alisha Malik.

820
01:10:13,541 --> 01:10:15,750
She's worked in Accounts for seven years.

821
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:22,833
<i>Hamid, I personally spoke
to the Pest Control Department.</i>

822
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:25,708
<i>None of their employees
went inside the restoration room.</i>

823
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:28,833
<i>These are the same four people,
and know about our cash.</i>

824
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:30,916
Light it.

825
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,291
Shall we move it somewhere else?

826
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:35,916
Hamid!

827
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,375
What if their plan is to scare us

828
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:42,000
so that it makes it easier for them
to steal the money when we move it?

829
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:44,875
Move it, indeed!

830
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:46,166
Light it.

831
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:49,333
We'll keep it in a place
that even their forefathers can't reach.

832
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:51,125
What are you saying, Hamid?

833
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:54,541
What could be more secure
than the Presidential Palace?

834
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:56,750
Mad.

835
01:10:58,041 --> 01:10:59,166
- Okay.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

836
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:00,541
- What?
- Sir...

837
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:01,583
Got a lighter?

838
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:06,208
Ma'am, actually, the fingerprints
we lifted from the garbage truck...

839
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:10,000
I checked them through the whole system
but I couldn't find a match.

840
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:12,083
Dumb ass!

841
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:15,041
Every day there's more bad news.

842
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:18,875
Where is he, that Sherlock Holmes?
Where is he?

843
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:19,958
Ma'am, who?

844
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:22,000
Irfan, who else?

845
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:25,416
Ma'am, he's in the museum's
restoration room.

846
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:28,375
Move!

847
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:34,333
Come on. Where is he?

848
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,291
Mr. Irfan, what are you doing here?

849
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:47,125
Ma'am, have you ever seen
Mr. P.C. Sorcar's magic show?

850
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:48,875
P.C. Sorcar?

851
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:51,625
I've seen it.

852
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:53,791
Some 20 years back.

853
01:11:54,791 --> 01:11:57,333
There was a very beautiful girl
sitting next to me.

854
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,125
And Mr. Sorcar... chose a volunteer.

855
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:03,666
Me.

856
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:07,208
And he asked me to choose
an assistant for myself.

857
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:09,333
So I chose her. She was beautiful.

858
01:12:10,166 --> 01:12:13,625
Mr. Sorcar then told me
a long spell in my ear

859
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:17,791
and asked me to make
that girl memorize it.

860
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:21,666
I tried my best,
but the girl kept getting it wrong.

861
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:23,291
Audience started laughing.

862
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,916
She couldn't learn and they kept laughing.

863
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,208
That's when Mr. Sorcar...

864
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,500
disappeared.

865
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:31,916
Like magic.

866
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:34,291
What a show!

867
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:37,125
Sir, it's a very common trick
among magicians.

868
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:38,583
That's their technique.

869
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:43,333
That girl who was sitting next to you
was actually Mr. Sorcar's assistant.

870
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:47,041
And he chose you
because you were sitting next to her.

871
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,875
He made a fool of you, that's all.

872
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:52,541
- Hamid!
- No, no, he's right. He's right.

873
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:58,750
And in just the same way,
the King made a fool of you.

874
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:00,625
- Me?
- Yes.

875
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:05,916
The King entered the building
with his people, unseen by any cameras,

876
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,791
got out and disappeared. Like magic?

877
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:13,833
But just like Mr. P.C. Sorcar
made his assistant sit next to me,

878
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:18,041
similarly, the King
made his assistant sit next to you.

879
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:20,750
You understand?

880
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:25,708
You rascal!

881
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:29,583
You work for the King!
You were hacking for him. Admit it!

882
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:31,250
Sir...

883
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:32,666
- Admit it!
- No, sir.

884
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:34,350
He can't be the King's man. I found him.

885
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:35,375
Yes, sir.

886
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:38,625
Did you find him or did he
find his way to you? Think, Hamid.

887
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:52,500
Sorry, sir.

888
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:05,458
He wasn't working for you.

889
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:08,625
He was hacking for them.

890
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:11,583
That's why they weren't seen
on any cameras.

891
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:12,875
And escaped.

892
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:15,375
And no records remained.

893
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:19,541
Lift her veil.

894
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:28,833
- Hamid!
- Hamid!

895
01:14:28,916 --> 01:14:31,750
Don't be stupid. Don't do this.
Guards, come here.

896
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:33,708
Stand down.

897
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:34,791
Hamid!

898
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:36,625
Take him away. I'll interrogate him.

899
01:14:37,791 --> 01:14:39,666
Tell Arjun I want fresh fingerprints.

900
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,416
I'm sure they'll match.

901
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,041
Whatever the King is after,
it's in this room.

902
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:47,291
Guards, nothing and no one
comes in or goes out of this room.

903
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:49,833
Seal this place.

904
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:55,875
- Hamid.
- Sir!

905
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:57,250
- We can still...
- It's over.

906
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:00,333
They found the truck and Raj is arrested.

907
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:03,625
By now they must have found out
that we know about the secret chamber.

908
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:04,750
It's over.

909
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:08,166
It's all right.

910
01:16:09,416 --> 01:16:10,416
I think we can try.

911
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:12,125
Everybody can...

912
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
One second.

913
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:18,958
What?

914
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:21,083
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

915
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,708
Thank you.

916
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:24,416
What is all this?

917
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,208
What happened?

918
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,750
She just proposed to me and...

919
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,541
I said yes.

920
01:16:37,458 --> 01:16:38,833
Congratulations, man!

921
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:39,916
Thank you, bro.

922
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:45,625
I'm so happy for you.

923
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:47,500
Come here! Wow!

924
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,375
- So cool.
- Yes!

925
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:52,708
Unbelievable.

926
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,375
Yo, bro!

927
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,166
We're getting married!

928
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Listen...

929
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:12,208
It's not over yet.

930
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,708
We will steal that money from right there.

931
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:18,958
I promise.

932
01:17:22,291 --> 01:17:23,291
These guys...

933
01:17:25,916 --> 01:17:28,750
Wait. It's my wedding.
I get to plan everything.

934
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:29,833
Really?

935
01:17:32,625 --> 01:17:33,708
Everything.

936
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:45,625
<i>I am your devotee</i>

937
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:50,041
<i>Only your devotee</i>

938
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,875
<i>When I first saw you
I got intoxicated and high</i>

939
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,958
<i>When I first saw you
I got intoxicated and high</i>

940
01:18:03,041 --> 01:18:06,791
<i>Don't get me any higher
I don't want to become a saint</i>

941
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:10,708
<i>I am at your door
Ready for you</i>

942
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:14,750
<i>The entire world seems to know
But only you don't seem to</i>

943
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:18,083
<i>I am your devotee</i>

944
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:23,000
<i>Only your devotee</i>

945
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:34,833
<i>Only you, my love, are on my mind
I am your devotee</i>

946
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:38,875
<i>Please don't keep me waiting
I am your devotee</i>

947
01:18:38,958 --> 01:18:42,583
<i>Only you, my love, are on my mind
I am your devotee.</i>

948
01:18:42,666 --> 01:18:47,208
<i>Please don't keep me waiting
I am your devotee</i>

949
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:54,375
<i>I am your devotee
Only your devotee</i>

950
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:56,708
<i>Oh, Brother!</i>

951
01:18:56,791 --> 01:18:59,125
<i>Hurry up and skip the scriptures</i>

952
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:00,916
<i>Everybody just say, Amen</i>

953
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,833
<i>Walk around the fire and
Everybody just say Amen</i>

954
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:09,000
<i>Finish all these rituals and leave
Let me do my thing, Amen</i>

955
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:13,416
<i>She's excited, my life is settled
Everybody just say Amen</i>

956
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,583
<i>I notice the small things you do</i>

957
01:19:17,208 --> 01:19:21,125
<i>Your intentions aren't noble
I know that too</i>

958
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:25,208
<i>You'll bring a bridal procession
To my door</i>

959
01:19:25,291 --> 01:19:28,875
<i>Not to marry me
But just to party with me all night</i>

960
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:33,333
<i>So then make a good man out of me
I am ready to be</i>

961
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:36,708
<i>The entire world seems to know
But only you don't seem to</i>

962
01:19:37,291 --> 01:19:40,708
<i>I am your devotee</i>

963
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:45,375
<i>Only your devotee</i>

964
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:56,583
<i>Only you my love is on my mind
I am your devotee</i>

965
01:19:56,666 --> 01:20:01,041
<i>Please don't keep me waiting
I am your devotee</i>

966
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:13,208
<i>I am your devotee</i>

967
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:17,250
<i>Only your devotee</i>

968
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:19,625
<i>I am your devotee</i>

969
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:52,291
Sir, the new fingerprints that Arjun sent,

970
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:53,750
from the bottle...

971
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:55,666
They don't match.

972
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:56,833
I tried many times.

973
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:00,791
The prints from the garbage truck
and the King card

974
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:02,375
belong to someone else.

975
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,875
Sir, did Raj reveal anything?

976
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:10,083
Nothing. He never met the King.
Only spoke on the phone.

977
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:12,708
And he has deleted all the phone records.

978
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:17,083
I don't understand
how is he doing all this?

979
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:19,250
And the main question is...

980
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:23,375
What are they trying to steal
from that room?

981
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:47,000
Bank of London.

982
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,166
What is all this?

983
01:22:08,083 --> 01:22:09,416
There is a bank in London.

984
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:14,208
They convert their client's money
into diamonds and keep it in a vault.

985
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:18,625
This bank has at least 550 billion
worth of diamonds.

986
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:22,541
But to steal from there
is virtually impossible.

987
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:27,833
Even the bank's managers can't open
the vault without the client present.

988
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:32,833
And you plan to convert the money
from this robbery into diamonds...

989
01:22:33,291 --> 01:22:34,500
become their client,

990
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,833
and steal all their diamonds.

991
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:39,958
That's the plan.

992
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:45,541
But I was thinking,
what if we do this robbery as a team?

993
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:48,666
You and I...

994
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:51,208
Together.

995
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:07,666
I swear, I'm telling you.
I'm not going to...

996
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,250
We'll be together. That's important.

997
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:11,000
Bullshit. I was right.

998
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:12,833
Never get married if you don't have money.

999
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:15,291
- Let's talk...
- Nothing is going to come of it.

1000
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:18,250
Guys, please tell us now.

1001
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:21,083
Where are we going for our honeymoon?

1002
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:25,041
- What?
- I mean, if we steal the money,

1003
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:28,791
then we'll go to Miami... or else Manali.

1004
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:31,875
You'll go to Miami. Because I have a plan.

1005
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:33,875
Really?

1006
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:35,041
Allow me to explain.

1007
01:23:35,541 --> 01:23:37,375
- Okay.
- Look...

1008
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:40,958
It's easy to enter the Palace
with restoration IDs.

1009
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,875
It's once we get inside
that our problems start.

1010
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:48,833
Number one. Without Raj,
we can't hack the CCTV cameras.

1011
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:53,416
Number two. Irfan is guarding
the artifact restoration room 24 hours.

1012
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:54,791
And number three.

1013
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:58,333
The truck we were to use
to take the cash out

1014
01:23:58,875 --> 01:24:00,541
has been impounded by Irfan.

1015
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:04,166
Babe... In that case
I'm booking our tickets to Manali.

1016
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:06,416
No! We got a plan.

1017
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:09,041
It is difficult but not impossible.

1018
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:11,458
So now, listen carefully.

1019
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:19,500
The CCTV camera system will freeze?

1020
01:24:22,708 --> 01:24:25,208
Arjun? The undercover cop Arjun?

1021
01:24:28,875 --> 01:24:31,583
Poem? The railcode?

1022
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:36,916
What? Wait!

1023
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,583
Cameras will take
only five and a half minutes to reboot?

1024
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:50,541
One minute. Let me get this straight.

1025
01:24:50,625 --> 01:24:52,791
To switch off the camera system,

1026
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:57,666
at lunch time, we're going to make both
the guards in the Control Room believe

1027
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:00,041
that the whole camera system has frozen.

1028
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:02,000
So they reboot the system themselves.

1029
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:03,750
Right.

1030
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:07,166
But that can only happen
if Irfan and his guards

1031
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:10,041
stay inside the museum's
artifact restoration room.

1032
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:12,666
Because that room
doesn't have any cameras.

1033
01:25:13,083 --> 01:25:15,041
And to keep them busy inside the room,

1034
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:17,791
we're going to use the railcode poem.

1035
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,083
Which I will send on Tara's phone
just before the cameras freeze.

1036
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:22,041
Okay.

1037
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:25,625
But then what we want is for Irfan
and his guards to leave the room

1038
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:28,750
the moment the cameras are rebooted.

1039
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:32,375
Because the system will reboot
in five and a half minutes

1040
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:34,458
which is too little time for us, anyway.

1041
01:25:35,708 --> 01:25:38,750
So basically, this whole plan
is dependent on Irfan.

1042
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:43,791
If he leaves the room a second before,
the cameras won't go off.

1043
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:48,916
And if he leaves late,
we won't have time to do the robbery.

1044
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I told you,

1045
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,833
it's difficult but not impossible.

1046
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:54,916
Okay.

1047
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,875
Let's assume everything goes as per plan.

1048
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:00,375
What about problem number three?

1049
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:02,541
They've impounded our truck.

1050
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:05,958
How will we escape with the cash?

1051
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,500
Oh, that's easy.

1052
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:10,125
We'll get caught.

1053
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:11,791
What?

1054
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:19,291
Oh!

1055
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:11,333
Oh, shit!

1056
01:27:14,041 --> 01:27:15,625
Hamid, Arjun is calling.

1057
01:27:16,625 --> 01:27:17,458
Go ahead, Arjun.

1058
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:19,875
<i>Sir, Tara just received
another message from </i>Shayari.com<i>.</i>

1059
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,125
That's railcode. Send it immediately.

1060
01:27:22,416 --> 01:27:23,416
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1061
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,083
He was clean bowled!

1062
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,041
Yeah, right.

1063
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:45,375
What happened to the system?

1064
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:47,416
How did all the cameras freeze?

1065
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:25,458
Looks like the system froze.

1066
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,000
Let's restart it.

1067
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:28,208
Just wait two minutes.

1068
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,583
Come on, hurry up.

1069
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:37,416
Come on.

1070
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:10,291
Look, something moved!

1071
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:14,041
No buddy, nothing moved.

1072
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:15,166
No, something moved.

1073
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:37,708
- I'm rebooting the system.
- No, wait two minutes.

1074
01:29:53,458 --> 01:29:54,625
Oh, my God! Let's go!

1075
01:29:58,416 --> 01:29:59,416
Idiot!

1076
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:20,458
Hey, why are the cameras off?

1077
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:22,250
Sir, the system froze. We rebooted it.

1078
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,208
- You guys are so stupid.
- Come on!

1079
01:30:46,666 --> 01:30:47,791
Ms. Vibha!

1080
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:22,625
- So much cash!
- Oh, my God!

1081
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:31,666
I'm a rich man, now. Money! Money!

1082
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,291
Put the cash in there.
Put the gold in the boxes! Now!

1083
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,583
Hey, what happened to the power? Check it.

1084
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:46,125
This way.

1085
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:50,416
This way! Here!

1086
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:53,666
- One minute, Hamid.
- Yes, sir.

1087
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:56,833
He does this every time.
Sends us one way and escapes another.

1088
01:32:56,916 --> 01:32:59,041
- Where's the truck?
- In the basement parking.

1089
01:32:59,291 --> 01:33:01,958
That's it. That's his exit route.
Come on, follow me!

1090
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:03,041
This way?

1091
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:41,833
- Hamid...
- Yes, sir.

1092
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:43,541
- Have you taken their phones?
- Yes.

1093
01:33:43,625 --> 01:33:45,000
And check all records as well.

1094
01:33:45,541 --> 01:33:47,458
Thank God they couldn't steal.

1095
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:50,791
Hamid! They took all the money.
They took everything.

1096
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:53,416
They escaped
with all our cash, Hamid. Catch them!

1097
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,958
- What money?
- Relax.

1098
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:56,416
What is she talking about?

1099
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,208
No, sir, she's just tense.

1100
01:33:58,291 --> 01:33:59,916
No, Hamid, the four took cash...

1101
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,208
What cash?

1102
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,458
- What cash?
- She's just tense. We caught them.

1103
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:05,666
Look, they're sitting here.

1104
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:07,791
- Here.
- Stop them. All the cash...

1105
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:10,291
No. Look here! All four of them.

1106
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:13,208
What happened to you?
What cash are you talking about?

1107
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:15,916
Why did you have to open your mouth?

1108
01:34:16,416 --> 01:34:18,291
They fooled us.

1109
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:20,166
These are not those four people.

1110
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:22,083
The real thieves are different people!

1111
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:33,083
Are you high?
These are the four that we caught. Look.

1112
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:35,083
Hamid, how do I explain to you?

1113
01:34:35,166 --> 01:34:37,541
They knew you all
were going to chase them.

1114
01:34:37,833 --> 01:34:40,458
So they sent you chasing these four.

1115
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:42,958
Who? What are you talking about?

1116
01:34:43,458 --> 01:34:45,416
Photos... I saw them in the photos.

1117
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:49,291
Where are they?
Yes, look at this. Look here.

1118
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:51,208
- This.
- This is the same girl. Tara.

1119
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:54,291
Yes, this is Tara.
But the other girl is the thief!

1120
01:34:55,875 --> 01:35:00,041
<i>Sir, the tyre marks that you had found
match that girl's car.</i>

1121
01:35:00,791 --> 01:35:04,000
<i>Her name is Tara
and she owns a local courier company.</i>

1122
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:07,541
<i>She only trusts two people.</i>

1123
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:10,375
<i>Bikki... and his girlfriend Naina.</i>

1124
01:35:10,666 --> 01:35:11,791
Where is that guy? Here.

1125
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:13,541
Look at this. This was the guy.

1126
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:16,041
This guy took most of the money.

1127
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:20,708
<i>The new fingerprints
that Arjun has sent don't match.</i>

1128
01:35:21,041 --> 01:35:26,208
<i>The garbage truck and King card
fingerprints belong to someone else.</i>

1129
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:34,833
You've been chasing the wrong people.

1130
01:35:34,916 --> 01:35:36,875
The real thieves
are escaping with the money.

1131
01:35:43,291 --> 01:35:45,208
Come on, move! Start.

1132
01:35:45,416 --> 01:35:46,541
Load it fast!

1133
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:50,375
Put them in the jeeps, fast!
Hurry up, move it!

1134
01:35:51,125 --> 01:35:53,291
What are you doing? Lift it carefully.

1135
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:54,375
Okay, all set?

1136
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,291
What are you doing? Lift it fast!

1137
01:36:06,666 --> 01:36:08,583
Why are you all
at the Presidential Palace?

1138
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:11,791
There's a conference in the Hall.

1139
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:14,958
High profile business people
are expected to attend.

1140
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:17,333
Sir, we were invited
to the trade conference.

1141
01:36:18,041 --> 01:36:19,208
How could we not attend?

1142
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:23,083
And how did you come here?

1143
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:25,166
In our own cars.

1144
01:36:26,166 --> 01:36:27,416
Driving.

1145
01:37:15,166 --> 01:37:17,333
Boss, they are chasing after you.

1146
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:20,708
Yes, we put the cash
into the Police Jeeps.

1147
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,375
Yes, boss.

1148
01:37:22,458 --> 01:37:23,458
Let's go, guys.

1149
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:28,500
That's them!

1150
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:17,833
Guys, to reach the highway we'll have
to cut through the airport. Let's go.

1151
01:38:39,875 --> 01:38:41,083
Shit!

1152
01:39:21,291 --> 01:39:22,291
Shit!

1153
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,375
Shit!

1154
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,625
Oh, shit! Pull!

1155
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:03,458
Damn it.

1156
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:33,291
Hamid, we are getting onto the highway.

1157
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:35,875
Put blockades ahead.
I want all exits covered.

1158
01:42:08,541 --> 01:42:10,333
Guys, are you ready to jump?

1159
01:42:18,541 --> 01:42:21,541
Hey, what you honking so much for?
Why don't you fly instead?

1160
01:42:35,875 --> 01:42:37,208
Stop!

1161
01:42:53,541 --> 01:42:54,875
Go! Up, up!

1162
01:43:57,166 --> 01:44:00,333
Sorry. Your journey ends here.

1163
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:08,750
You did all those robberies
and left the King's name behind.

1164
01:44:13,166 --> 01:44:14,458
You left my name behind.

1165
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:56,750
<i>Because of you, the cops came after me.</i>

1166
01:44:57,166 --> 01:44:59,666
<i>And now I have to run again,</i>

1167
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:01,875
<i>change my identity again.</i>

1168
01:45:01,958 --> 01:45:05,083
<i>So, in my place,
I'm leaving you behind for the cops.</i>

1169
01:45:09,583 --> 01:45:13,541
<i>Your fingerprints will match
the prints on the garbage truck.</i>

1170
01:45:13,833 --> 01:45:15,500
<i>You loved playing King, right?</i>

1171
01:45:15,958 --> 01:45:17,208
<i>So, congratulations!</i>

1172
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:24,166
Now everyone will think
that you're really the King.

1173
01:45:58,458 --> 01:45:59,666
Trying to run with the money?

1174
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:02,208
Tell me where my money is!

1175
01:46:10,208 --> 01:46:11,458
Stop it, Hamid! No!

1176
01:46:11,791 --> 01:46:13,083
- Stop it!
- Sir, let go of me!

1177
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:15,250
- I'll kill him.
- Arrest him!

1178
01:46:15,333 --> 01:46:18,041
Arrest him, I said!
Find out about that cash!

1179
01:47:54,041 --> 01:47:56,875
So sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. Khan.

1180
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:05,458
Do you have the diamonds with you?

1181
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:08,500
Lovely!

1182
01:48:08,583 --> 01:48:09,958
Shall we proceed to the vault?

1183
01:48:10,583 --> 01:48:11,750
Yes, of course.

1184
01:48:27,416 --> 01:48:32,291
May I leave you in the very capable hands
of our vault manager, Mr. Sharma?

1185
01:48:34,166 --> 01:48:35,416
Yes, of course.

1186
01:48:54,625 --> 01:48:56,875
It's good to see you, Mrs. Khan.

1187
01:49:00,291 --> 01:49:01,500
What are you doing here?

1188
01:49:02,750 --> 01:49:03,750
Waiting for you.

1189
01:49:05,833 --> 01:49:08,666
What did you think?
You saw my plans by chance?

1190
01:49:19,083 --> 01:49:23,458
<i>I left my iPad open
just so you could see it all.</i>

1191
01:49:24,041 --> 01:49:28,458
You see, I had full faith
that you would certainly betray me.

1192
01:49:30,791 --> 01:49:33,875
I told you the plan,
and then made a small suggestion.

1193
01:49:34,875 --> 01:49:36,291
There is a bank in London.

1194
01:49:36,583 --> 01:49:40,291
Even the bank's managers can't open
the vault without the client present.

1195
01:49:41,666 --> 01:49:43,833
<i>And finally... a distraction.</i>

1196
01:50:11,041 --> 01:50:12,041
Shall we, ma'am?

1197
01:50:15,541 --> 01:50:17,458
You could have made anyone a client.

1198
01:50:18,166 --> 01:50:19,583
Why did you come only to me?

1199
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:24,083
I needed 50 billion,
and you were going to steal that.

1200
01:50:25,666 --> 01:50:27,833
Actually, I wanted
to tell you the truth sooner.

1201
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,166
But my boss didn't trust you.

1202
01:50:30,416 --> 01:50:31,416
So...

1203
01:50:33,208 --> 01:50:34,250
Boss?

1204
01:50:53,333 --> 01:50:55,416
<i>Hello, Ms. Vibha, this is Kirit Ojha,</i>

1205
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,708
<i>Special Personal Secretary
to the Prime Minister.</i>

1206
01:50:57,791 --> 01:51:00,250
<i>He needs your help with a personal matter</i>.

1207
01:51:00,625 --> 01:51:02,041
<i>I'm sending my guy to you.</i>

1208
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:05,125
<i>His name is Irfan.
He'll give you the details.</i>

1209
01:51:08,875 --> 01:51:09,875
<i>Good morning, ma'am.</i>

1210
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,291
<i>Hold him! Arrest him! Arrest him, I said!</i>

1211
01:51:42,458 --> 01:51:45,958
Good morning, Mrs. Khan.
So nice to finally meet you.

1212
01:51:46,166 --> 01:51:48,625
I'm Mr. Peter,
the Security In-charge of this bank.

1213
01:51:49,125 --> 01:51:51,666
Now that we're all here,
let's open the vault.

1214
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:52,791
Yes.

1215
01:51:52,875 --> 01:51:54,458
Let me start with my password.

1216
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,916
Yours, Mr. Sharma, is second as always.

1217
01:52:11,250 --> 01:52:13,083
You can either enter your code

1218
01:52:13,583 --> 01:52:16,041
and share 50-50 with us,

1219
01:52:16,125 --> 01:52:18,458
or none of us will get anything.

1220
01:52:19,291 --> 01:52:21,083
The choice is yours.

1221
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:46,041
It would be a good idea
to step back, please.
