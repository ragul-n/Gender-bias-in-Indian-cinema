1
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,878
Do you know what's the situation?

2
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:23,045
Either you've to give up police
uniform or l must give up politics.

3
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:29,226
We're running a govt. of notes and
Nandu is running a govt. of knives.

4
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:34,223
You're marching past on roads
and he's dancing my head.

5
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:38,902
Sir, let's bump him off.
- Bump him off? ls he a kid?

6
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:41,734
He sleeps in people's hearts
not on bed.

7
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:44,911
lf we push him now,
we'll be in deep trouble.

8
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:48,570
You don't worry sir,
it's my duty to kill him legally.

9
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:50,579
There must be a daring
police officer to do it, right?

10
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:51,910
There is one, sir.
- Who?

11
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:21,274
We're tensed and
he's eating a chocolate.

12
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:23,950
lt's their tension not ours.

13
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:25,615
You wanted to say something,
go ahead.

14
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,657
There are en terrorists who have
targeted the hospital, sir.

15
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:32,285
They missed it but managed
to kidnap Minister's daughter.

16
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:35,124
Whether it's Minister's daughter
or your maid servant,

17
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:36,626
saving them is our duty.

18
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,748
The man you say appears
like a crazy man.

19
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,917
l thought he's a kid for
eating chocolates.

20
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:39,787
But he's not an ordinary man.

21
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:42,255
He hit the forehead and
burst into pieces.

22
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:46,756
Easwara Prasad is our only
chance to checkmate Nandu.

23
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:50,255
Think of it, sir.
- Okay, call him.

24
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,446
Take care of these guys.

25
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:11,951
Control him.

26
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:13,278
Why couldn't you till now?

27
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:15,352
No FlR has been filed
against him till date.

28
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,283
How many people in that group?
- 5!

29
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:20,289
So, 5 Pandavas!

30
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:24,794
Looking at his smart photo,
don't think he's soft.

31
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:27,133
Killing is his profession.

32
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:31,293
lt's left to you, control him or
terminate him in your style.

33
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,808
My people shouldn't face
any trouble from him.

34
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:38,808
Take as much force as you need
and finish him once for all.

35
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:43,476
4 officers!
- What? 4?

36
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:48,811
With me 5!
-5 Pandavas, it's 5 versus 5!

37
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:05,835
Bullet is safe till it's inside
the revolver.

38
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,406
Press the trigger and
bullet comes out piercingly!

39
00:07:10,544 --> 00:07:11,408
Me too!

40
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,848
We'll not become a hurdle to you.
You pierce through him!

41
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:29,021
Don't give him all the powers,

42
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:32,198
if anything goes wrong,
he'll finish us too!

43
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:38,197
Did you see? He got into car
and he's asleep.

44
00:07:38,405 --> 00:07:42,865
lt's not his mistake, it's my driving,
super smooth, l too fall asleep.

45
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:47,043
Are you also feeling sleepy guys?
Why are you dull?

46
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:49,875
l don't like sir taking up this case.

47
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,217
l've ended up as driver to him.

48
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:59,552
ls your name Poosamuthu?
- Aren't you asleep sir?

49
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:05,888
My grandpa's name was Poosalu,
my grandma's name was Muthyalu,

50
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:09,557
my mother joined both name and
fondly called me as Poosamuthu.

51
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,902
Yes sir.
- Bad like you. Pull over.

52
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,951
What's this?
- Tea and chocolate, sir.

53
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:25,248
Would anyone have tea
and chocolate?

54
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:27,420
l'll have it.

55
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:35,595
He's half kid and half crazy.

56
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,928
lf your thought comes out,
bullet will enter your head.

57
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,093
You wanted to say something, right?
Come out.

58
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:45,101
We feel why should we chase Nandu
leaving criminals, sir?

59
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:48,103
Nandu is not a notorious criminal.

60
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:50,276
How can it wrong to kill criminals?

61
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:53,105
What about the file then?

62
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:57,443
Not a word in it is true, sir.
Every word is to justify themselves.

63
00:08:57,651 --> 00:09:01,451
Okay, they told me what they knew,
tell me what you know.

64
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:06,281
Ramapuram is Nandu's hometown
which is 120 kms away from here.

65
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:12,124
Nandu's father is the head to

66
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:16,131
Why are you sitting on floor?

67
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:18,463
lt's the place of a devotee
before a God.

68
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:20,139
Please don't make a god, MP.

69
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,970
Elections are coming again,
your word is Bible to people.

70
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,476
lf you support and
help us to win again...

71
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:31,640
Leaders who give good governance,
people will vote them to power.

72
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,146
l'm sure you'll win again.
- Happy to hear it, sir.

73
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:36,151
Nandu's mother is Lakshmi Devi, sir.

74
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:39,985
As her name suggested she was
always there to help anyone.

75
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:42,320
Madam, my mother isn't feeling well.

76
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,997
She's running fever,
l've to take her to hospital.

77
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,996
Give me my purse, hold this son.
Take it.

78
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:49,998
Take good care of your mother.

79
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:52,171
Come to work after she's fine.
- Okay madam.

80
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:55,671
For the charity his father had done,
there wasn't any poor man in that place.

81
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:58,170
Nandu was born into such a great family.

82
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:19,021
Father! Why do you always insist
l light the camphor every day?

83
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:23,070
On the auspicious day of Shivarathri,

84
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,370
as l was offering prayers to
our family deity Lord Shiva,

85
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:28,700
you were born then,

86
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:32,204
that's why l've named you
as Nandheeshwarudu.

87
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:33,709
Do you know why?

88
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:39,383
You must become a like Nandheeshwara
who orders Lord Shiva,

89
00:10:39,586 --> 00:10:40,382
and mustn't become one
who covets,

90
00:10:40,587 --> 00:10:42,089
that's why l named you like that.

91
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:47,049
To make you remember that everyday,
l'm asking you offer prayers every day.

92
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,184
What did you wish from God, mother?

93
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:22,315
l wished that God to make
my son a great lPS officer.

94
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:26,151
l'll become an lPS officer to
fulfill your wish, mother.

95
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,153
Bless me, mother.

96
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:33,659
College life has good as well
as bad, be careful Nandu.

97
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:35,164
Okay mother.

98
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:37,170
Father...

99
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:38,667
Come.

100
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:43,672
l'll take leave, brother.

101
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:46,842
Be careful bro!

102
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:48,677
Bye father!

103
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:51,749
Don't go over speed.
- Be careful son.

104
00:12:52,552 --> 00:12:55,222
Go carefully son.
- Bye mother. Bye father.

Life means duty...

Dreams behind the eyes is great...

112

Life is little naughty and
joy to share with friendship...

113

lt's increasing my pulse rate
and spreading cheer...

This is very hot, Guru !

00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,947
College is very colourful.

134
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,947
Are you taking tablets on time, Babe?

135
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,956
Why did you beat me now?

136
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,462
Just beat, l should chop you.

137
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:37,466
You always call me, when l answer,
you cut the call immediately.

138
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,796
No brother!

139
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:42,634
l've been trying for half an hour,
it says out of calling area!

140
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:43,809
That's why l'm cutting the call.

141
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,810
That's not out of calling area
but my caller tune!- ls it?

142
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:50,479
Get ruined!

143
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,647
Where are you going?

144
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:53,978
To library, why are you asking me?

145
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:56,553
Why don't you go after
giving me a kiss?- Bloody fool!

146
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:58,653
Greetings brother.
- Greetings.

147
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:03,158
Cap must be like mine, remove it.

148
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:07,655
Why are you wearing a chain?
Keep it in the cap. Remove it.

149
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:12,665
Why are you hiding your ring?
Keep it in the cap. Keep it!

150
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,509
Give it to me, get ruined!

151
00:18:24,217 --> 00:18:25,684
What are you looking at?

152
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:28,187
What will you get looking at it?
Just waste of time.

153
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:31,023
What bothers you man?
- What bothers me?

154
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:33,522
Do you know who am l?
- Who are you?

155
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:37,856
l'm the senior most and sincere student
studying here for the past 7 years.

156
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:40,032
How dare you argue with me?
- What if we do?

157
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:45,697
l wanted to give you this chain
but l didn't like your face.

158
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:49,204
So l'm giving it to you.
You enjoy it, you too!

159
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:53,034
Get ruined!
Follow sincere senior Seenu !

160
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:55,544
Why did you let him off, Nandu?

161
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:59,878
We're here to study,
he appears like a chimp in circus,

162
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:02,884
no need to fight with him.
Return the chain to its owner.

163
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:25,237
Brother, got selected to the finals
for a TV program.

164
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:30,743
l'm pleased to see your
determination to win.

165
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,577
l'll definitely win, brother.

166
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:34,912
l'm sure you will.
- Thanks brother.

167
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:39,156
Why did you come without
any intimation?

168
00:19:41,794 --> 00:19:46,595
You were like clean shaven Arnold
in my dream last night,

169
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,096
why are you sporting a stub now?

170
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:51,638
l was with you all the night, right?
No time to shave.

171
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:53,765
Good morning sister.
- How are you doing, Chinna?

172
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:54,940
l'm fine, sister.

173
00:19:59,646 --> 00:20:00,943
Why are you not having the tea?

174
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:03,775
Stop talking, take this.

175
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,780
What's this, brother?
- Check it.

176
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:09,281
New clothes!
- You !

177
00:20:10,156 --> 00:20:12,124
Wear it.
- Thanks brother.

178
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:16,860
l thought you're different,
l find a good man in you now.

179
00:20:17,997 --> 00:20:20,295
Why did you stop here, sir?
- Hold this.

180
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:23,670
Now l've understood
why he ended up as a criminal?

181
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,672
No problems or anything.

182
00:20:25,672 --> 00:20:27,640
Day time in bar and nights in pub!

183
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,307
A lover to pass time.

184
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:31,678
Lover's father would be a factionist,

185
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:34,146
her father would've come to
know about their love story,

186
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:36,645
what else?
Few Sumos would've got blown up!

187
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:39,317
Next is fights and chases.
Bloodshed for this girl!

188
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:40,812
lsn't this your favourite heroism?

189
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,317
'Preminchukundam Raa'
(Come, let's fall in love)

190
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:43,986
Yuck! Should l love Poosamuthu?

191
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,987
No sir, you just told the
story of that film.

192
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:47,989
Yes, what's the story you
wanted to tell me?

193
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:51,994
l'll tell you the real story how Nandu
became Nandheeshwarudu.- Go ahead.

194
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,197
Getting scared?

195
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:38,707
Didn't you feel it before
going to the court?

196
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:45,210
lf you kill us now, another lawyer
and another witness would come.

197
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:46,385
Justice will win.

198
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:49,722
Filing a case on Babu,

199
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:55,383
how can l leave you alive after getting
them to give evidence against him?

200
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:58,230
Brother Vasant, please spare us.

201
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:03,061
Unable to watch gruesome murders
we criminals commit,

202
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:07,069
Angel of justice has
got herself blindfolded.

203
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:11,232
lt's been many days since l saw
a live murder, please brother!

204
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:17,910
Tiger which got used to flesh,
knife which got used to blood,

205
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:19,744
it'll never listen to words.

206
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,767
Dr. Yugandhar
Public Hospital

207
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:09,791
A large hospital here!
A big bungalow in Jubilee Hills.

208
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:17,465
ls this fight necessary for 100 acres?
That too with Babu !

209
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:25,478
Do you know why my husband left
that 100 acres for orphans?

210
00:23:25,852 --> 00:23:28,150
To ensure they wouldn't
end up like you rogues.

211
00:23:28,354 --> 00:23:33,986
We've killed the lawyer and
witnesses, you know that?

212
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:35,990
Whether you kill lawyer
or witnesses,

213
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:38,493
if not this court,
l'll approach higher court.

214
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:40,867
You'll not listen to soft words.

215
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:47,329
l know how to make you and
your pride come down to earth.

216
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,334
Come with me!

217
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:17,904
lf you go to court again,
right here,

218
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:20,532
your elder daughter who is
studying in Bangalore,

219
00:24:20,907 --> 00:24:23,034
and your younger daughter
who is studying in Chennai,

220
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:24,869
both of them will the same fate!

221
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:26,875
Be ware!

222
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:33,886
Do you know who am l?

223
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:46,887
lf you're henchmen of Baba,
will you kill people as you wish?

224
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:52,400
You don't know about Baba.
- Why should l know about him?

225
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,247
Do goons and rogues have
history to know about them?

226
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,420
Are you Baba who owns these mad dogs
which are attacking innocent people?

227
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:18,096
New beggar is very enthusiastic.

228
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:19,966
l'll arrest you also in near future.

229
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:23,265
lt seems this uniform on body
makes you proud.

230
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:29,431
l don't walk on ground but
on the back ground.

231
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:31,978
l'll put an end to your
criminal activities,

232
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:34,606
l'll unmask your illegal activities,

233
00:25:34,981 --> 00:25:36,983
and get all the cases against
you re-opened,

234
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:40,282
and send you to jail,
till then l'll not rest...

235
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:47,956
Father...father...

236
00:25:48,494 --> 00:25:51,952
He rushed in haste, let him take rest.

237
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:56,631
l'll cut short the life of
one who talks too much.

238
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:00,638
You go sir, l'll take care.

239
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:02,133
ls he dead?

240
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:09,314
He's dead, sir.

241
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:11,980
Let's mourn silently for 2 minutes.

242
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:23,660
To render justice whenever
injustice takes over,

243
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,488
l'll come to do justice.

244
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:51,078
Only you remain now.

245
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:53,751
Kabaddi isn't just touching
the opponent's crease,

246
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,247
you must rip the opponent's heart!

247
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:58,150
No use of winning like a eunuch !

248
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,147
Who said that?

249
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,648
ls it you?
- No.

250
00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:10,162
You?...

251
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:12,656
ls it you?
- Not me, brother.

252
00:29:16,702 --> 00:29:19,170
l'm sure it's you.
- Not me brother.

253
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:20,835
Come on boys.

254
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:25,837
Wasn't it you who said that?
- No.

255
00:29:26,212 --> 00:29:27,213
Then, why are you leaving?

256
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:29,215
He's bleeding,
l've to take him to hospital.

257
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:31,217
Why are you trying to escape?
Tell me the truth.

258
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:32,684
You said that, right?
- Trust me, l didn't.

259
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:34,352
Anyway, why should l comment on you?

260
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:35,679
l'm sure you would've said.

261
00:29:35,888 --> 00:29:38,186
l had won over your team, right?
You said it.

262
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,189
l didn't play like a eunuch,
play like a man now.

263
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:55,241
How dare you call me by my name!
- No Rajesh !

264
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:58,369
How dare you point a finger at me!
- l said no!

265
00:30:01,747 --> 00:30:04,875
Why don't you be a man
despite beating you, bloody?

266
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:44,290
Sorry Baba! Tongue piece fell
in mud and got infected.

267
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,258
So, l couldn't do the surgery.

268
00:30:47,793 --> 00:30:49,818
He can never speak in life again.

269
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:56,598
Who did this to my brother?

270
00:30:57,636 --> 00:30:59,763
lt seems a student of MLR college.

271
00:30:59,972 --> 00:31:01,439
His name is Nandu.

272
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,600
Where ever he may be,
he must be before me in half hour. Go!

273
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:31,463
Brother, we searched entire
city to kill him on sight,

274
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,466
but we couldn't find him.

275
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:36,300
Yes, we combed streets
and lanes, no use.

276
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:38,976
Bloody idiot got scared
and left this town.

277
00:31:42,348 --> 00:31:46,478
What the hell are you doing?
Where is he?

278
00:31:49,855 --> 00:31:51,322
l'm here, Baba!

279
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:24,352
l know you'll come for me,
so l've come here myself.

280
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:35,864
How dare you beat my brother!

281
00:32:36,068 --> 00:32:39,697
Your brother beat me, l kept quiet.

282
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:42,540
He used bad word against
my mother, l beat him.

283
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:44,038
Will you beat if he abuses
your mother?

284
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,878
How dare you beat my man
right before my eyes!

285
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:58,050
Legs must shiver and eyes
must ooze fear to stand before me.

286
00:32:58,424 --> 00:33:02,622
l've the courage to kill,
l don't fear death,

287
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:07,562
l beat your brother like this
for abusing my mother.

288
00:33:08,434 --> 00:33:10,402
l didn't know he's your brother
when l beat him.

289
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:11,899
Even if l had known,
l would've beaten him.

290
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:18,070
Your mother...if l abuse your
mother, won't you get angry?

291
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,407
Aren't you also son of a mother?

292
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:25,572
lf you think l've done wrong, kill me.

293
00:33:32,124 --> 00:33:34,092
Go away! Go!

294
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:45,770
You should've killed him.

295
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:50,499
There's no fun in killing a deer
coming into the tiger's den,

296
00:33:50,976 --> 00:33:57,006
we must kill him in public like
a goat sacrificed to Goddess.

297
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:08,116
Death must be so fearsome that
people must shiver even in dream.

298
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:11,622
Trying to boss over the college,
how dare you sit on bikes!

299
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,626
Get down.

300
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:17,465
l'm talking to you, why are you
giving poses? Again build up?

301
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,466
You wait.

302
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,639
Do you know who beat Rajesh yesterday?

303
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,967
Nandu, he's my student.

304
00:34:24,176 --> 00:34:26,644
Do you know who ordered him?
On my order.

305
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:28,642
Then, where is your student?

306
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:31,645
You fool, l've sent him
to get a cigarette.

307
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,648
Didn't you bring cigarette
for your Guru, Nandu?

308
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:38,152
Brother!...

309
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:42,153
Get up.- l'll not leave
till you make me your friend.

310
00:34:42,528 --> 00:34:43,153
l say get up.

311
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:46,498
l'll not leave your leg, brother.
- Okay, get up.

312
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:53,494
Order tea, l'm bored.
- Brother! Give that chance to me.

313
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:55,669
Okay, come.

314
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:56,738
Mother!

315
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:59,545
Have you come?
- Come.- What happened?

316
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:02,548
How many days have passed
since you showed up?

317
00:35:02,548 --> 00:35:03,674
Tell me how many days?
- 10 days.

318
00:35:03,882 --> 00:35:04,678
10 days?

319
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:08,011
One says you're in police station,
another says you're in railway station,

320
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,555
another says...
- Stop it mother.

321
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:10,749
Don't dishonour me before my friends.

322
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:16,562
Son ! l've seen you somewhere!

323
00:35:16,562 --> 00:35:17,028
Which place are you from?

324
00:35:17,229 --> 00:35:18,526
l'm from Ramapuram.

325
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,566
Whose son are you in Ramapuram?

326
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:22,033
l'm Ananda Bhupathy's son.

327
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:25,866
Are you Ananda Bhupathy's son?
- Yes mother.

328
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:32,874
We've not seen God but people say
God would be like your father only.

329
00:35:33,078 --> 00:35:36,582
Mother, stop it.
Serve tea to the guests.

330
00:35:36,582 --> 00:35:38,550
Stop, let me talk to him.
l'll serve, wait.

331
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,878
Don't talk, get tea.
- Come children, sit.- Okay.

332
00:35:42,588 --> 00:35:44,055
Gas is empty.

333
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:53,060
Mother, l'll get gas cylinder.
- Get it fast.- l will.

334
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,567
l'll be back in few minutes.
- Okay.

335
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:01,902
Sit there.

336
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:10,077
Order.
- One more tea, mother.

337
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:13,251
You're coming to shop with me,
right Nandu?

338
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:15,753
Let's shop before they
finish their tea.

339
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:19,625
l'm having headache,
l've to take rest after having tea.

340
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,922
No time for shopping.

341
00:36:21,793 --> 00:36:24,921
You'd say like that,
you follow till girls fall for you,

342
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,928
but once girl falls,
you start neglecting her.

343
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:44,105
The jasmine is hiding in her eyes...

344
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:52,951
Gravitation unknown to Earth also...

345
00:36:53,158 --> 00:37:00,621
She's a twin sister of moon...

346
00:37:02,668 --> 00:37:09,631
Chaos...chaos...
she's creating chaos in me...

347
00:37:17,683 --> 00:37:20,982
What a beauty!

348
00:37:21,186 --> 00:37:27,147
She created a lovely hurricane
in me like a villain...

349
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,661
Don't know whose genes
you're carrying?

350
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:34,991
O young princess!

351
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:23,044
l'm always lost in her
thoughts like SMS's...

352
00:38:23,248 --> 00:38:26,877
She's filling up the inbox...

353
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:30,756
My only job all the day
is delete it...

354
00:38:30,756 --> 00:38:34,385
lt's her image that's printing
always like an MMS in my heart...

355
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,764
Though she says useless
and it's nonsense...

356
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:42,063
l can't avoid saying it...

357
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:49,230
Not slippers,
stars too bounce for her...

358
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:53,070
l'm telling you from my heart
though l stay away from girls...

359
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:56,907
When l'm before her,
l lose control...

360
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:59,743
l trip and lose my balance...

361
00:39:38,156 --> 00:39:41,827
Friendly Pomeranian in my home...

362
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:45,831
lt's happy following me
everywhere l go...

363
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:49,130
As l leave it and follow the girl...

364
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:53,134
lt's confused if l'm also a dog...

365
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:59,971
ls there anything more intoxicating
to make me forget myself?

366
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:07,812
That's what the bottles
of Champagne l drink feel strangely...

367
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:11,857
The flowers in my garden...

368
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:18,319
lt's crisis if you don't look at them,
and they camouflage it...

369
00:40:42,888 --> 00:40:44,355
Enough !

370
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,183
Daughter-in-law is serving with love.

371
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,187
Sister-in-law, serve me too.

372
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:54,855
l did serve, but you were
looking at sister.

373
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:57,869
Hello readymade sister, serve properly.

374
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:01,527
lf not they'll get angry, they've to
accept and bless your marriage.

375
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:03,374
You go out,
l know how to serve them.

376
00:41:03,575 --> 00:41:05,873
No...
- Don't talk, go.

377
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:08,872
Why are you doing it?
There are maids to do.

378
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,379
Mother, she wishes to stay
with all of you.

379
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:16,384
Yes aunt, l'm an orphan and
Nandu gave me a big family.

380
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:18,215
lt's enough if l become
a part of your family.

381
00:41:18,423 --> 00:41:21,392
You wish will come true.
Come, join dinner with us.

382
00:41:21,593 --> 00:41:25,393
No, l feel content on seeing you all.

383
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:28,998
No, she wants to get fed by Nandu.

384
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:36,399
What's this Nandu?
Why is your father coming at this hour?

385
00:41:37,943 --> 00:41:40,241
Go, talk to him about your marriage. Go.

386
00:41:40,445 --> 00:41:42,948
Mother, l'm little tensed.

387
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:44,916
You kids are like this,
you've no tension to fall in love

388
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:48,574
but to inform your parents
you get it.

389
00:41:48,954 --> 00:41:50,421
Go.
- No mother...

390
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:51,247
Go l say.
- Go brother.

391
00:41:52,457 --> 00:41:55,255
Go.
- Go.- Go Nandu.

392
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:16,272
Father!

393
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:19,613
l want little peace.

394
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:23,446
Will you let me sleep?
- Okay father.

395
00:42:37,002 --> 00:42:38,299
What happened to my father?

396
00:42:41,006 --> 00:42:42,974
Tell me what had happened
in office yesterday?

397
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:45,977
What's this, Ranga Rao?

398
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:50,136
Nothing, agreement papers.
Sign it too.

399
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:51,016
Why?

400
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:54,315
How long will you run this
school for public?

401
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:57,488
lf we sell liquor, we can mint money.

402
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:05,326
You were on streets, l pitied
and made you my partner,

403
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:08,988
and accepted your daughter
as my daughter-in-law,

404
00:43:09,534 --> 00:43:12,332
don't take it as advantage.

405
00:43:12,537 --> 00:43:16,667
Brother-in-law, l've planned this
for your welfare only.

406
00:43:17,042 --> 00:43:20,170
No need.
Don't waste my time, get out.

407
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:22,346
You're underestimating me.

408
00:43:22,547 --> 00:43:25,015
What will you do?
- You don't know about me.

409
00:43:26,051 --> 00:43:29,020
Threatening me?
- l'm threatening, l'm ordering you.

410
00:43:30,555 --> 00:43:33,183
Will you sign the papers or not?

411
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:35,689
l'll not sign.
- Won't you?

412
00:43:38,229 --> 00:43:42,689
Don't get into unnecessary fight
and spoil your life.

413
00:43:43,068 --> 00:43:47,027
l may become a good police officer
if l pass with good marks,

414
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:51,076
if l don't bash him now,
l won't be a good son.

415
00:43:51,076 --> 00:43:52,043
District Magistrate court

416
00:43:52,744 --> 00:43:53,711
Move!

417
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,547
We must win this case at any cost.
We mustn't lose.

418
00:43:57,248 --> 00:44:01,207
How can we lose when we've so
many fake witness for fake liquor?

419
00:45:38,183 --> 00:45:40,310
What's this?

420
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:45,148
How dare you kick my father!

421
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:08,001
Hello! Sl is here!
Writer is there! Come here.

422
00:46:08,213 --> 00:46:11,671
There's no time to tell you
and let him write it.

423
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,517
That's why l'm going to cell directly.

424
00:46:13,718 --> 00:46:15,185
What's your crime?

425
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:20,016
A donkey named Ranga Rao kicked
my father, so l broke his leg.

426
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:26,528
With the available evidence,
accused Nandheeshwarudu alias Nandu,

427
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,360
has attacked wantonly Ranga Rao,
his father's kinsman,

428
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:36,369
and since he has accepted
that he broke his leg,

429
00:46:36,574 --> 00:46:41,246
under the sections of
lPC 320, 322, 323,

430
00:46:41,246 --> 00:46:45,444
l'm sentencing him to 6 months
imprisonment and Rs.1000 as fine.

431
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,278
Got hurt?

432
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:54,285
How dare you ignore me!

433
00:48:01,826 --> 00:48:02,793
Stab me!

434
00:48:17,008 --> 00:48:19,977
Nandu, your mother and father
are here, come out.

435
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:37,324
How are you father?

436
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,997
How are you mother?

437
00:48:43,034 --> 00:48:47,494
When you're in jail,
how can we be fine there?

438
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:52,676
Why do you get so angry?

439
00:48:52,877 --> 00:48:59,384
Father does justice if anyone
gets raw deal in our place,

440
00:48:59,384 --> 00:49:03,514
if anyone dares to kick him...
l couldn't bear it, mother.

441
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:08,351
Your mother is not eating
properly worrying about you.

442
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:13,019
How can l be happy if you
don't eat well, mother?

443
00:49:17,902 --> 00:49:21,702
You brought his favourite
tamarind rice, serve him. Come.

444
00:49:37,088 --> 00:49:37,952
Enough mother.

445
00:49:39,757 --> 00:49:43,386
l never expected l'll be away from
you and your love, mother.

446
00:49:44,429 --> 00:49:46,397
Father, this is not a place
for people like you.

447
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:49,392
You go now, father.

448
00:49:51,602 --> 00:49:54,400
Keep this money.
- No father.

449
00:49:54,605 --> 00:49:57,073
Keep it.
lt'll be helpful. Take it.

450
00:49:57,442 --> 00:50:00,570
Get going, time is over.
- Come, Lakshmi.

451
00:50:06,784 --> 00:50:09,912
Take care mother.
- Take care son.

452
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:20,085
Take care brother.
- Okay dear. Take care of mother.

453
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:29,435
Please don't tell anything
about this to Pragathi.

454
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,436
No way.

455
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:33,439
She may feel bad.
- No way!

456
00:50:47,158 --> 00:50:50,958
When l can share your love,
can't l share your sorrow too?

457
00:50:54,832 --> 00:51:00,464
One who loves his parents,
it seems he'll love his wife too.

458
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:04,637
Take care.

459
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:06,639
Come out, it's time.

460
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:26,823
You appear like a student.
ls it half meal or full meal?

461
00:51:27,865 --> 00:51:31,995
Broke a man's leg.
- Great! So half meal.

462
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,497
What are you planning to do
after getting released?

463
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:38,501
l'll continue my studies.
- lmpossible.

464
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:44,675
Once your name enters FlR, your name
will be struck from college rolls.

465
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:51,011
Friend, you'd have been on
TV news channel scrolls.

466
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:57,691
lf anyone in this city wants to break
anyone's leg, he'll approach you only.

467
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,197
lt won't happen with me.

468
00:52:02,066 --> 00:52:03,533
Situation is in our hand till
we commit a crime,

469
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:05,531
once done, it's not our hands.

470
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:10,707
Look at the man playing Kabaddi,

471
00:52:12,243 --> 00:52:14,541
if he stops saying Kabaddi, he's out.

472
00:52:15,246 --> 00:52:17,714
lf you stop now, you'll be finished.

473
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:21,882
That's okay, what crime did you commit?

474
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:27,049
l've a daughter.

475
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:35,730
Father, l'll get well soon and go
to school like other kids, right?

476
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:39,729
What happened, father?

477
00:52:42,273 --> 00:52:43,240
She's afflicted with cancer.

478
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:48,739
l'm a regular jail bird
committing crimes for her.

479
00:52:50,281 --> 00:52:52,146
But till now what ever l stole
isn't enough for her treatment.

480
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:58,581
Tomorrow l'll be out of jail,
l'm scared of meeting her.

481
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:02,258
Your daughter would be fine.

482
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:06,597
Allah's mercy!

483
00:53:55,012 --> 00:53:56,707
l'll be out in an hour.

484
00:53:59,183 --> 00:54:01,310
Take this money.
- What is this?

485
00:54:01,686 --> 00:54:03,654
For your daughter's operation.

486
00:54:04,689 --> 00:54:06,987
l've written all the details
and address too.

487
00:54:07,191 --> 00:54:10,991
lf you go to this address,
my parents will help you.

488
00:54:12,196 --> 00:54:12,992
No please.

489
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:16,166
Two good things would
happen with this.

490
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:19,825
Your daughter will live and you needn't
have to commit crime again.

491
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:21,338
Accept it.

492
00:54:23,374 --> 00:54:24,170
Thank you.

493
00:55:07,251 --> 00:55:08,718
Are you fine, Nandu?
- l'm fine.

494
00:55:09,086 --> 00:55:10,053
How are you guys doing?

495
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:17,720
How are you?
- l'm fine.

496
00:55:17,928 --> 00:55:20,226
How do you know l'm getting
released today?

497
00:55:20,431 --> 00:55:23,889
What's this? You've come to
jail for the first time.

498
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:25,898
l'm a jail bird.

499
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:29,402
l know the punishments
for the crimes.

500
00:55:29,774 --> 00:55:31,071
How is your daughter?

501
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:42,408
l came out eagerly to meet
my daughter.

502
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:45,918
She's missing.

503
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:51,261
My parents as well as
my daughter are missing.

504
00:55:52,463 --> 00:55:53,430
l'm an orphan now.

505
00:55:53,798 --> 00:55:57,427
No Salim bhai, how can you
be orphan when l'm here?

506
00:55:57,802 --> 00:56:00,270
You're in my heart, bhai.

507
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:08,278
Would you please listen to me?

508
00:56:08,479 --> 00:56:09,446
Will you just keep on reading
the newspaper?

509
00:56:09,814 --> 00:56:11,111
Go, they're leaving.

510
00:56:11,315 --> 00:56:12,942
Keep it there. Go.

511
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,447
They may bring back your
brother to home.- Okay.

512
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:15,786
Tell them not to bring him.

513
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:18,280
Are you going to the jail, uncle?

514
00:56:18,489 --> 00:56:20,787
Yes, Nandu is getting released today.

515
00:56:22,326 --> 00:56:24,294
How can you receive him
with empty hands?

516
00:56:24,495 --> 00:56:28,833
Buy a rose garland on the way for him
and bring him home in a procession.

517
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,960
lt'll add honour to our family.

518
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:32,294
What are you saying?

519
00:56:32,503 --> 00:56:36,303
Are you planning to bring back a man
who ruined our family honour?

520
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:38,134
He's your brother.

521
00:56:38,342 --> 00:56:42,301
The man who broke my father's leg
isn't his brother or my brother-in-law.

522
00:56:42,513 --> 00:56:45,812
Your father kicked my brother, that's why
his brother broke your father's leg.

523
00:56:46,016 --> 00:56:47,142
What are you trying
to say, father-in-law?

524
00:56:47,351 --> 00:56:49,319
Nandu must come to this
home at any cost.

525
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,818
Yes, he must come.
- He must come home.

526
00:56:53,524 --> 00:56:57,984
Okay, you told your wish,
l must tell my wish, right?

527
00:56:58,195 --> 00:57:00,993
The moment he enters
this home, l'll walk out.

528
00:57:01,198 --> 00:57:03,325
What are you saying son?

529
00:57:03,534 --> 00:57:05,832
What did uncle told us
from our childhood?

530
00:57:06,036 --> 00:57:09,836
He told goons and rogues mustn't
enter the boundary of this place.

531
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:16,343
Do you like such a man entering
not only this place but our home too?

532
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:21,340
Expecting this, Nandu has stopped
outside the boundary of this place, sir.

533
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,849
What are you saying?
- Yes madam.

534
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:25,521
Nandu sir asked me to
bring all of you there.

535
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:28,017
Come madam...come...
- Brother, let's go.

536
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,877
Father!

537
00:57:47,912 --> 00:57:48,537
Father!

538
00:57:50,581 --> 00:57:53,880
What's like a kid?
- Father...

539
00:57:55,252 --> 00:57:56,219
Mother...

540
00:57:58,255 --> 00:58:01,383
lt seems you refused to come home.

541
00:58:01,592 --> 00:58:03,560
Don't you feel like meeting
your mother?

542
00:58:03,928 --> 00:58:06,931
l came here to meet only you, mother.

543
00:58:06,931 --> 00:58:10,230
Then come, let's go home.
- Come.

544
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:16,562
No mother, that's not a home but
a temple presided by this deity.

545
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:18,571
Criminals are barred to enter.

546
00:58:18,943 --> 00:58:22,572
You did this for your father, right?
How can you be a criminal?

547
00:58:22,947 --> 00:58:27,077
You did the right thing for manhandling
God like Ananda Bhupathy.

548
00:58:27,952 --> 00:58:32,412
l thank all of you for the
respect you've on my family.

549
00:58:32,623 --> 00:58:34,591
Any son would do the same,
brother Nandu.

550
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,964
Did you see mother?
Did you see father? Did you see uncle?

551
00:58:39,964 --> 00:58:43,092
Till now people used to call me as Nandu,

552
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,427
now they call me as brother Nandu.

553
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:49,929
l want love and affection,
not to fear me, uncle.

554
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:50,936
Brother!

555
00:58:51,308 --> 00:58:56,109
You come home, brother,
we can't live without you.

556
00:58:57,648 --> 00:59:01,948
Not only your sister,
l too can't live without you.

557
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:05,948
Come.
- No father.

558
00:59:06,991 --> 00:59:08,458
l've promised mother.

559
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:10,627
That l would become a police officer.

560
00:59:11,328 --> 00:59:13,956
l'll come back to home after
undoing my mistakes.

561
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:15,631
Please forgive me, father.

562
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:21,130
Take care of mother, father.

563
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:54,997
O flying butterfly...

564
00:59:55,706 --> 01:00:01,338
Who knows what's in store ahead?

565
01:00:01,712 --> 01:00:06,172
Your parents' hearts are broken...

566
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:12,686
You're in a sea of tears...

567
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:19,022
Let fate take you where ever
your destination is...

568
01:00:19,229 --> 01:00:29,537
May your journey reach
the right destination...

569
01:00:34,078 --> 01:00:35,545
This is my house.

570
01:00:35,746 --> 01:00:38,044
You've adjust in this small home.

571
01:00:38,248 --> 01:00:41,217
Size of home doesn't matter,
what matters is size of heart!

572
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:43,716
From today l've two sons.

573
01:00:44,088 --> 01:00:47,057
l was sad for God taking me away
from my mother.

574
01:00:47,257 --> 01:00:49,225
But he has sent me
to another mother.

575
01:01:08,779 --> 01:01:11,115
Why did you come here?

576
01:01:11,115 --> 01:01:12,082
Brother, that is...

577
01:01:14,284 --> 01:01:15,251
ln search of a job, brother.

578
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:18,421
Look, if my partners come to
know you'd been to jail,

579
01:01:18,622 --> 01:01:20,124
what would happen to my honour?

580
01:01:20,124 --> 01:01:22,092
l'll not tell anyone that
l'm your brother.

581
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:26,092
Nobody would hide a fire under firewood.

582
01:01:26,797 --> 01:01:30,096
Okay, l'll go away if you don't
want me here.

583
01:01:30,634 --> 01:01:34,593
Please forgive me
if l had hurt you, brother.

584
01:01:38,142 --> 01:01:39,109
Give me.

585
01:01:41,145 --> 01:01:42,612
What's it dear? Please sit down.

586
01:01:43,147 --> 01:01:44,774
Finished your tea.
- Yes mother.

587
01:01:45,315 --> 01:01:46,282
Move.

588
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:51,116
Why are you here early in the morning?

589
01:01:52,156 --> 01:01:54,454
l've got you a jog, my man.

590
01:01:54,658 --> 01:01:57,161
Are you offering the job
of being your man?

591
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:58,128
That's later.

592
01:02:01,331 --> 01:02:02,298
What's this?

593
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:04,694
Take this letter and go there.

594
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:08,468
My friend's company, you'll get a
job tomorrow, marry day after that.

Then okay, come to me...

lf you be my companion,
l'll be your prisoner for life...

611
01:04:42,826 --> 01:04:47,286
lf you wish, l'll get you
entire coastal region...

612
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:50,960
lf you say yes,
l'll swim across sea...

613
01:04:51,335 --> 01:04:54,463

622
01:05:54,898 --> 01:05:59,028
l'll get you bathed with
Kohinoor diamonds...

623
01:05:59,403 --> 01:06:02,406
l'll sleep in snow too...

624
01:06:02,406 --> 01:06:05,534

Do you add water to milk
or add milk to water?

lf l make tea from such milk,
l may have to close my hotel.

629
01:06:37,441 --> 01:06:39,068
Are you finding fault with
brother Vasant's milk?

630
01:06:39,443 --> 01:06:43,402
Tell your brother, if he sells such
milk or charge usury interest,

631
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:45,911
he would die with leprosy!

632
01:06:46,116 --> 01:06:49,745
People are spitting on him.
Does he know it?

633
01:06:49,953 --> 01:06:51,750
Go, tell your brother Vasant.

634
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:56,752
Why are you sniffing like
a police dog?

635
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,587
l told my mother to prepare
chicken today.

636
01:06:58,795 --> 01:07:00,464
l'm trying to catch the smell.

637
01:07:00,464 --> 01:07:04,924
There will chicken and also chicken
fried rice too, get water first.

638
01:07:12,642 --> 01:07:13,609
Mother!

639
01:07:17,814 --> 01:07:18,940
What happened mother?

640
01:07:20,484 --> 01:07:23,612
Mother...what happened mother?

641
01:07:26,656 --> 01:07:27,782
Please talk to me, mother.

642
01:07:27,991 --> 01:07:30,960
Mother, why don't you talk to me?

643
01:07:34,164 --> 01:07:34,789
Mother!

644
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,128
Mother, what has happened to you?

645
01:07:39,503 --> 01:07:40,470
Talk to me, mother.

646
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:41,796
What happened to you mother?

647
01:07:50,514 --> 01:07:51,481
Brother Vasant!

648
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:56,478
Bring it down !

649
01:07:59,189 --> 01:08:02,488
Sir...Vasant sir...what's this?

650
01:08:04,861 --> 01:08:07,557
Please stop them, l'm losing my stock.

651
01:08:11,201 --> 01:08:14,170
Please stop them sir,
l beg you sir.

652
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:19,498
Poor people have hands
not to point our mistakes,

653
01:08:19,709 --> 01:08:21,506
but to fall at my feet!

654
01:08:22,546 --> 01:08:28,178
How dare you abuse Vasant!...

655
01:08:30,554 --> 01:08:33,682
Are you cursing that l'll get leprosy?

656
01:08:35,225 --> 01:08:38,854
Would people spit on me?

657
01:08:39,896 --> 01:08:43,696
Spit...spit on me. Spit!

658
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:59,777
Did you think l'm just a beast?

659
01:09:01,251 --> 01:09:08,555
l'm a usury who mints money
on interest!

660
01:09:09,593 --> 01:09:12,118
Go to hell!

661
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:57,269
Hey old lady! You've come with them,
are you here seeking donation?

662
01:09:59,142 --> 01:10:02,270
Vasant! We're not here for donation.

663
01:10:02,646 --> 01:10:04,773
l'm here to tell you to seek
forgiveness from mother.

664
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:08,109
ls she your mother of his mother?

665
01:10:08,318 --> 01:10:09,785
Mother is mother to all!

666
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,618
Fall at mother's feet and
seek her forgiveness,

667
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:14,619
and rebuild her hotel.

668
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:20,790
Nandu, you can't do business with
withered leaves and old women.

669
01:10:20,997 --> 01:10:23,795
lt's not manliness to beat a woman.

670
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,959
Not your mother, send your sister,
l'll show my manliness.

671
01:10:28,171 --> 01:10:29,638
that too live show!

672
01:10:29,839 --> 01:10:33,639
Vasant, you're talking wrong.

673
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:35,140
Do what l said!

674
01:10:35,845 --> 01:10:40,684
Do you think am l Baba's brother
to cut my tongue?

675
01:10:40,684 --> 01:10:44,142
Vasant means violence!
Would you like to see?

676
01:10:44,354 --> 01:10:46,822
Don't add fuel to the fire.
Just do as he says.

677
01:10:47,023 --> 01:10:49,321
Fire? ls he fire?

678
01:10:52,696 --> 01:10:53,822
l've doused it!

679
01:10:54,197 --> 01:10:57,325
l'm telling you again.

680
01:10:57,701 --> 01:11:01,330
Seek forgiveness from mother.
Just do as l say!

681
01:11:01,705 --> 01:11:03,332
You bloody!

682
01:11:07,043 --> 01:11:10,911
What bothers him
if l abuse your mother?

683
01:11:11,715 --> 01:11:14,183
By any chance one mother
and two fathers!

684
01:11:20,056 --> 01:11:24,728
You came to my place,
you fell into my cow dung heap,

685
01:11:24,728 --> 01:11:26,195
picking up my sickle,

686
01:11:26,396 --> 01:11:28,023
are you thinking of killing me?

687
01:11:44,748 --> 01:11:47,376
l thought he's just a sapling,
he has grown into tree.

688
01:11:47,751 --> 01:11:49,048
We must cut him down !

689
01:11:49,753 --> 01:11:53,052
lf not he'll take deep roots here!

690
01:11:53,923 --> 01:11:55,049
Go Naganna!

691
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,056
Are you fine, Nandu?

692
01:12:02,932 --> 01:12:04,229
l'm sure you'd be fine?

693
01:12:04,768 --> 01:12:07,396
You broke a man's leg earlier
and now beheaded a man,

694
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:08,897
and killed my love.

695
01:12:09,105 --> 01:12:11,733
lt wasn't Nandu's mistake.
- You're right.

696
01:12:12,275 --> 01:12:16,234
Nandu who was always smiling started
killing other ever since your arrival.

697
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:20,807
Nandu was always happy but
learnt to kill after meeting you.

698
01:12:21,785 --> 01:12:24,413
You decide and Nandu executes it.

699
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:29,815
Don't talk nonsense.

700
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:32,757
All decisions are mine,
don't accuse them.

701
01:12:33,797 --> 01:12:38,757
Once l decide even God
can't change it.

702
01:12:38,968 --> 01:12:41,937
lf you don't like my path,
let's part ways.

703
01:12:43,473 --> 01:12:46,442
lf that's your decision, l'll go away.

704
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,938
l'll go far away so that you or
your thoughts can't find me.

705
01:12:50,146 --> 01:12:53,115
l can't live fearing about your safety.

706
01:12:53,316 --> 01:12:56,774
l grew up as an orphan,
l can't live like an orphan.

707
01:12:56,986 --> 01:12:58,954
Never again try to meet me.

708
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:04,956
She's leaving, please stop her.

709
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:08,790
Let her go.
Fish is safe in water only.

710
01:13:09,499 --> 01:13:12,366
She'll be danger with us,
that's why l was harsh on her.

711
01:13:34,357 --> 01:13:36,860
Tell me, where is Nandu?

712
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,327
l don't know, brother.

713
01:13:38,528 --> 01:13:42,988
You've to sell tea tomorrow, right?
- Yes brother.

714
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,827
You've to give what ever you
earn to mother, right?

715
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:47,161
Yes brother.

716
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:51,329
lf you want mother to be fine,
tell me where is Nandu?

717
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:54,339
Mother promise,
trust me, l don't know.

718
01:13:55,211 --> 01:14:02,014
lt means you want Nandu
to be safe not your mother.

719
01:14:02,218 --> 01:14:06,518
lf you tell me the truth,
you can cry aloud tea to sell,

720
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:13,193
if not this sickle would say die.

721
01:14:17,901 --> 01:14:20,904
No brother, please don't harm me.

722
01:14:20,904 --> 01:14:23,907
l gave you free teas so many times.

723
01:14:23,907 --> 01:14:25,033
Please spare me, brother.

724
01:14:37,246 --> 01:14:39,043
l don't want your dance show.

725
01:14:39,248 --> 01:14:42,217
What your mouth refused to do,
your hand will do it now.

726
01:14:42,418 --> 01:14:45,216
Please don't harm me.
- Bloody idiot!

727
01:15:07,109 --> 01:15:08,736
You don't worry brother.

728
01:15:09,111 --> 01:15:10,112
Though l've lost a hand,

729
01:15:10,112 --> 01:15:13,081
l can work with another hand
and look after my parents.

730
01:15:13,282 --> 01:15:17,412
What was his crime?
He chopped his hand mercilessly.

731
01:15:17,619 --> 01:15:21,077
Mother, please don't chide brother.

732
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:23,087
Who chopped your hand?

733
01:15:35,304 --> 01:15:37,772
Salim bhai, come to KGR
hospital immediately.

734
01:15:38,307 --> 01:15:39,103
Okay.

735
01:15:39,641 --> 01:15:41,268
Catch him boys!

736
01:16:02,664 --> 01:16:04,291
Kill him boys!

737
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:35,780
he killed my husband and
made my children as orphans,

738
01:18:35,984 --> 01:18:37,451
kill this bloody rogue! Kill him!

739
01:18:37,653 --> 01:18:41,783
Kill the man who chopped my hand!
Kill him!

740
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:45,448
He doesn't know the difference
between a mother and loving wife.

741
01:18:45,661 --> 01:18:48,330
He has no right to live.
Kill him!

742
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:52,289
One who comes from people,
one whom people love is a leader,

743
01:18:53,335 --> 01:18:55,530
they're waiting for
a leader like you.

744
01:18:56,338 --> 01:18:59,307
Don't spare him Nandu bhai,
kill that bastard!

745
01:18:59,508 --> 01:19:01,806
Kill him...kill him...

746
01:19:31,373 --> 01:19:34,672
Lord Shiva has been desecrated!

747
01:19:34,876 --> 01:19:36,503
You've got the order from lord.

748
01:19:36,712 --> 01:19:38,009
Kill him!

749
01:20:02,738 --> 01:20:08,870
Though these goons do us injustice,
we wipe our tears of sorrow,

750
01:20:09,077 --> 01:20:12,376
you're an answer to the
calls of help to God,

751
01:20:12,581 --> 01:20:16,418
God has come in your form
to terminate these goons,

752
01:20:16,418 --> 01:20:19,546
mother earth is thrilled!

753
01:20:19,755 --> 01:20:21,882
May God bless you son !

754
01:20:23,091 --> 01:20:27,892
l promise in the witness of Lord Shiva,

755
01:20:28,096 --> 01:20:29,893
if society is temple of Lord Shiva,

756
01:20:30,098 --> 01:20:32,566
if people are incarnations of Lord,

757
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:38,570
l'm Nandheeshwara to save
such people from demons.

758
01:20:39,441 --> 01:20:41,409
l'll stay here only.

759
01:20:41,777 --> 01:20:44,905
l'll be a son to every mother,
brother to every sister,

760
01:20:45,113 --> 01:20:48,913
l'll be a brother to everyone,
and protect all of you !

761
01:20:49,117 --> 01:20:53,577
Rowdyism, hooliganism, law,
police, politicians, my foot!

762
01:20:53,789 --> 01:20:55,586
Let anyone come with
anybody's support,

763
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:58,089
l'll hack them to pieces,

764
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:02,590
l'll consecrate the basic
five elements with their blood.

765
01:21:13,475 --> 01:21:17,935
He's deadly weapon...

766
01:21:18,146 --> 01:21:22,606
Clarion call to challenge evil...

767
01:21:22,818 --> 01:21:27,489
A force to eliminate evil...

768
01:21:27,489 --> 01:21:31,949
A lightning thunder...

769
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,618
A diamond in a pool of fire...

770
01:21:35,831 --> 01:21:39,130
Third eye of Lord Shiva...

771
01:21:39,501 --> 01:21:58,809
He's visible and walking Nandheeshwara!

772
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:05,496
Good!

773
01:22:06,364 --> 01:22:10,994
So you mean Nandu is the hero
and l'm the villain here to kill him.

774
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:11,994
That's what you say, right?

775
01:22:12,203 --> 01:22:14,501
You've understood me very well sir.

776
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:19,172
Why are you aiming gun on me, sir?

777
01:22:19,377 --> 01:22:24,337
Once the bullet is loaded,
gun will feel bad if l don't fire.

778
01:22:24,549 --> 01:22:28,349
lf you fire gun for the feeling,
my wife and kids will feel sad then.

779
01:22:28,553 --> 01:22:29,850
You're good in countering me.

780
01:22:30,054 --> 01:22:31,556
Better than your encounters, sir?

781
01:22:31,556 --> 01:22:34,525
Why should we kill ourselves?
Must kill those who deserve to die.

782
01:22:39,063 --> 01:22:42,032
We've completed the
investigation on Nandu, sir.

783
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:44,534
All the details are in this.

784
01:22:46,571 --> 01:22:47,538
We'll take leave, sir.

785
01:22:50,074 --> 01:22:53,202
You asked me to tell his story and
inquired about him through others.

786
01:22:53,411 --> 01:22:57,575
Was l sent here to listen to
your tales and eat chocolates?

787
01:22:59,417 --> 01:23:01,885
You told me what you knew.

788
01:23:02,587 --> 01:23:06,546
l'll tell you how it started
and how it ended.

789
01:23:07,258 --> 01:23:08,225
l'll show you...

790
01:23:51,969 --> 01:23:55,427
Brother Baba, my husband has
been killed.

791
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,608
Who will look after my children now?

792
01:23:58,309 --> 01:24:02,268
l told you kill him that day.
You let him off.

793
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,947
What's the result?

794
01:24:04,148 --> 01:24:06,275
Earlier Vasant and now Naganna,

795
01:24:06,484 --> 01:24:08,281
and he'll kill you also in future.

796
01:24:09,153 --> 01:24:12,122
Look at him!
Should we also die like him?

797
01:24:15,493 --> 01:24:18,951
l'm always there to bail you
out from any trouble.

798
01:24:19,163 --> 01:24:20,289
Take him away.

799
01:24:26,504 --> 01:24:34,639
lf you sleep in beach for cool breeze,
Tsunami may drown you.

800
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,376
He's dangerous than Tsunami.

801
01:24:38,683 --> 01:24:44,144
Whether you give up or eliminate
him, decision is yours.

802
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:46,156
Take care.

803
01:25:19,056 --> 01:25:22,514
What are you doing here?
- Don't ask me, ask them.

804
01:25:24,562 --> 01:25:26,731
Who are you guys?
What are you doing here?

805
01:25:26,731 --> 01:25:30,690
We've given you time
to vacate this place.

806
01:25:31,068 --> 01:25:32,365
Don't invite trouble.

807
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:35,698
Trouble is for you not for us.
- Troubles for us?

808
01:25:41,579 --> 01:25:43,376
Look at the police force behind me.

809
01:25:49,754 --> 01:25:55,784
You may have police force but
we've Nandheeshwara, saviour of poor.

810
01:25:59,096 --> 01:26:14,069
Hail Nandheeshwara!

811
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,247
Please sit down sir.

812
01:26:23,788 --> 01:26:27,087
They said about saviour of poor,
is it about you?

813
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:31,421
Don't talk MRO!
Just listen to what is said.

814
01:26:31,629 --> 01:26:33,756
He bought this place from Govt. sir.

815
01:26:34,632 --> 01:26:37,760
Govt. has handed over the
work of vacating this place.

816
01:26:38,135 --> 01:26:43,095
Govt. which never cares about
where and how a poor man lives,

817
01:26:43,307 --> 01:26:45,275
has it sent to demolish his home?

818
01:26:45,643 --> 01:26:48,771
He has no one to support whether
he's thirsty or hungry,

819
01:26:49,146 --> 01:26:53,606
if you come to take the
place of a poor man's dwelling,

820
01:26:53,818 --> 01:26:56,616
do you think there's no one
to ask about this atrocity?

821
01:26:56,821 --> 01:26:58,448
Do you think nobody would
come to their rescue?

822
01:26:59,323 --> 01:27:01,450
Are you the buyer?
- Yes.

823
01:27:01,659 --> 01:27:04,787
Did you buy govt. or leaders running it?

824
01:27:05,329 --> 01:27:10,130
What do you want to build over
the graves of these poor men?

825
01:27:10,334 --> 01:27:12,461
Planning to build 60 blocks of flats.

826
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:13,796
Build 80 blocks.

827
01:27:14,171 --> 01:27:15,638
Why should l build 20 extra blocks?

828
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,137
For the poor people.

829
01:27:17,341 --> 01:27:18,808
Are you threatening him?

830
01:27:31,522 --> 01:27:36,892
Build 80 blocks, if you insist on
building 60 locks only,

831
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:39,659
then dig a grave for you here.

832
01:27:39,864 --> 01:27:40,831
This is injustice sir.

833
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:44,827
lnjustice? Shall l tell you
how justice would be?

834
01:27:57,548 --> 01:28:00,517
You wanted to wipe out
their lives with money,

835
01:28:00,718 --> 01:28:03,846
l wanted to save their lives
with muscle power,

836
01:28:04,722 --> 01:28:08,351
any work can be done easily in
our govt. with money or muscle power.

837
01:28:08,893 --> 01:28:10,360
Got it?

838
01:28:10,728 --> 01:28:14,186
From now on they own this land.

839
01:28:14,732 --> 01:28:17,860
lt's enough if you build homes
for us in our land.

840
01:28:18,235 --> 01:28:19,862
We'll work hard for you, sir.

841
01:28:20,738 --> 01:28:21,864
All we need is just a small home.

842
01:28:23,407 --> 01:28:26,376
Did you see the merciful heart
of a poor man?

843
01:28:26,577 --> 01:28:29,478
Give them their livelihood
and save your life.

844
01:28:30,314 --> 01:28:35,115
l'm telling you as Nandu,
don't you dare see Nandheeshwarudu.

845
01:28:35,586 --> 01:28:46,394
Hail Nandheeshwarudu !

846
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:39,331
He helps the refuge seekers
and kills the evil doers...

847
01:30:39,543 --> 01:30:41,670
He's the protector...

848
01:30:41,879 --> 01:30:47,511
Even is God perplexed with
your genes of your family...

849
01:30:47,718 --> 01:30:57,061
You're Lord Shiva the destroyer
of evil and saviour of good...

850
01:30:57,061 --> 01:31:21,716
When people call him, he runs to
protect them and their property...

851
01:31:21,919 --> 01:31:29,883
When danger lurks,
you come running to protect...

852
01:31:31,428 --> 01:31:36,100
You're a saviour of people,
you're the pulse of people...

853
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:38,068
You're the light of hope
in the dark...

854
01:31:38,435 --> 01:31:44,738
You're Lord Shiva who destroys
evil and protects the good...

855
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:55,179
As l promised you,

856
01:32:55,179 --> 01:32:57,807
in these 80 blocks,
retaining 60 blocks,

857
01:32:58,015 --> 01:33:00,184
rest 20 blocks l've got it
registered in their names.

858
01:33:00,184 --> 01:33:04,143
Documents and keys are
in this briefcase.

859
01:33:04,521 --> 01:33:06,148
Are you fine Nandu?

860
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:10,490
lt seems you gave my lands
to poor people.

861
01:33:10,861 --> 01:33:15,161
Happy to see you and
your poor people. Shall we meet?

862
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:20,000
Brother, he won't turn up.

863
01:33:20,204 --> 01:33:22,672
He wets pants on the
mention of your name.

864
01:33:22,873 --> 01:33:23,840
That's your imagination.

865
01:33:29,713 --> 01:33:34,514
Starting life as a student, you've grown
to become Nandheeshwarudu.

866
01:33:34,718 --> 01:33:39,018
Forget about my growth,
tell me why did you call me here?

867
01:33:40,057 --> 01:33:42,924
Every step l put forward,
you're digging a ditch there.

868
01:33:44,561 --> 01:33:45,186
This is not good.

869
01:33:45,562 --> 01:33:49,862
Stop threatening,
tell us why did you call us here?

870
01:33:50,067 --> 01:33:52,865
Are you threatening us in our area?

871
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:54,697
Hey you sidekick! Keep quiet!

872
01:33:54,905 --> 01:33:58,602
Nandu, l'm giving you two options,

873
01:33:59,243 --> 01:34:01,609
one, leave this city,

874
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:05,947
two, make a choice between
Hyderabad or Secunderabad.

875
01:34:06,917 --> 01:34:09,044
Do your business and live happily.

876
01:34:09,586 --> 01:34:12,885
ls this your father's property
to rule as you like?

877
01:34:13,924 --> 01:34:19,226
Put an end to your activities,
sit tightly.

878
01:34:20,097 --> 01:34:22,266
lf not l'll chop you into pieces.

879
01:34:22,266 --> 01:34:27,226
l've killed people before
l started wearing underwear.

880
01:34:27,604 --> 01:34:28,229
Would l get scared of you?

881
01:34:28,605 --> 01:34:32,234
Stop it! Stop your illegal business.

882
01:34:33,944 --> 01:34:35,571
l didn't come on your invitation,

883
01:34:38,782 --> 01:34:40,909
l came to warn you.

884
01:34:45,622 --> 01:34:50,753
lt seems you're claiming that you spared
my life and l've grown like this.

885
01:34:50,961 --> 01:34:52,087
You're mistaken.

886
01:34:53,797 --> 01:34:56,095
Had l decided that day,
you would be dead and gone.

887
01:34:57,134 --> 01:34:58,931
You'll be dead even if l decide now.

888
01:35:01,638 --> 01:35:02,764
Be careful!

889
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:31,134
Hubby!

890
01:35:33,837 --> 01:35:34,963
What's it Lakshmi?

891
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:37,807
How is Nandu?

892
01:35:39,343 --> 01:35:40,970
Don't know if he's eating properly?

893
01:35:41,845 --> 01:35:46,305
He feeds many hungry mouths,
so God would take care of him.

894
01:35:48,852 --> 01:35:50,820
l wished him to become
a police officer.

895
01:35:51,855 --> 01:35:55,655
He's doing the same job
but without wearing uniform.

896
01:35:56,693 --> 01:36:01,323
Many are born for themselves,
some are born for the family,

897
01:36:01,698 --> 01:36:03,666
only very few are born
for the people.

898
01:36:04,368 --> 01:36:06,996
Your son is one of them.

899
01:36:08,205 --> 01:36:12,005
Lord Shiva would protect Nandheeshwara.

900
01:36:13,877 --> 01:36:19,679
Salim, we trust you and fix this deal.

901
01:36:19,883 --> 01:36:23,011
You must get us justice.
- Don't worry!

902
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:26,018
l'll talk to Nandu and
ensure you get justice.

903
01:36:28,725 --> 01:36:29,350
Bye sir.

904
01:36:44,408 --> 01:36:45,375
Where did you get this photo?

905
01:36:45,742 --> 01:36:48,040
Don't get tensed, follow me.

906
01:37:04,094 --> 01:37:07,393
What's this like a school kid?
Keep it inside.

907
01:37:08,265 --> 01:37:09,061
Sit down.

908
01:37:10,434 --> 01:37:13,130
Sit down. Let's discuss.

909
01:37:20,944 --> 01:37:23,913
Not just the photo,
even the girl is with me.

910
01:37:24,948 --> 01:37:27,746
lsn't she cute, my darling?
- Yes.

911
01:37:28,452 --> 01:37:31,751
Don't waste time asking to show
and allow to talk to her,

912
01:37:31,955 --> 01:37:37,757
if you trust us, just follow
if not...

913
01:37:37,961 --> 01:37:39,929
Cool darling!

914
01:37:40,964 --> 01:37:45,424
He'll do...whatever we ask him to do.

915
01:37:46,303 --> 01:37:46,769
What do you want?

916
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:48,938
Kasturba Orphanage

917
01:37:52,309 --> 01:37:55,278
How are you doing, Pragathi?
- l'm fine.

918
01:37:57,147 --> 01:37:59,445
Why are you calling me as Mirchi sister?

919
01:37:59,816 --> 01:38:01,784
Why don't you just call me as sister?

920
01:38:01,985 --> 01:38:04,510
See what l've got for you.

921
01:38:05,489 --> 01:38:08,515
l'll give.

922
01:38:08,825 --> 01:38:10,793
Take it. Go, play.

923
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:16,958
Your medicines, and
half of my salary as donation.

924
01:38:17,167 --> 01:38:18,964
Why are you doing all this?

925
01:38:19,169 --> 01:38:21,505
How is Charisma?
- Tomorrow she's getting operated.

926
01:38:21,505 --> 01:38:22,130
How about money?

927
01:38:22,339 --> 01:38:23,806
lt's arranged.
- How?

928
01:38:24,007 --> 01:38:25,975
Nandu gave it.
- Nandu?

929
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:28,144
Yes, Nandheeshwarudu.

930
01:38:28,345 --> 01:38:32,516
He's protecting these orphans
like God.

931
01:38:32,516 --> 01:38:37,146
Children here are able to study
whatever they want to study.

932
01:38:43,026 --> 01:38:45,153
He's Nandheeshwarudu !

933
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:47,827
Hi children !

934
01:39:03,547 --> 01:39:04,548
Greetings sir.

935
01:39:04,548 --> 01:39:06,516
You're an elder, mustn't greet me.

936
01:39:10,053 --> 01:39:12,521
Where is Charisma?
- She's inside.

937
01:39:19,396 --> 01:39:20,564
How are you doing dear?

938
01:39:20,564 --> 01:39:22,566
Ready for the operation.

939
01:39:22,566 --> 01:39:24,033
Aren't you scared of it?

940
01:39:24,234 --> 01:39:26,031
You're there with me, right uncle?

941
01:39:26,403 --> 01:39:31,575
She likes you very much.
She always talks about you only.

942
01:39:31,575 --> 01:39:35,534
Oh nothing! l love her.

943
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:37,205
Bye dear.

944
01:40:26,463 --> 01:40:28,260
Nandu, let's go.

945
01:40:37,974 --> 01:40:38,941
Leave him.

946
01:40:42,312 --> 01:40:43,108
Boss.

947
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:49,618
Switch it on my dear, please.

948
01:40:55,492 --> 01:40:58,290
l beg you, please listen to me.

949
01:40:58,495 --> 01:41:01,293
l don't have to listen to what you say.

950
01:41:01,498 --> 01:41:04,467
You were loyal like a dog.
- No!

951
01:41:05,168 --> 01:41:07,636
Trust me for one more time.

952
01:41:08,004 --> 01:41:09,130
What do you say darling?

953
01:41:10,173 --> 01:41:11,470
Shall we give him another chance?

954
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:14,636
Then switch it off.

955
01:41:18,181 --> 01:41:19,148
Boss!

956
01:41:23,687 --> 01:41:27,487
Had l not shot him dead,
he would've got caught.

957
01:41:27,691 --> 01:41:29,318
Think about the situation then.

958
01:41:29,526 --> 01:41:32,696
First me and then you,
Nandu would've killed us.

959
01:41:32,696 --> 01:41:34,994
You want me to believe this.

960
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:36,665
Whether you believe it or not,
this is truth.

961
01:41:37,534 --> 01:41:39,661
Nothing in this world is closer
to me than my daughter.

962
01:41:40,537 --> 01:41:42,004
Give me one more opportunity.

963
01:41:42,372 --> 01:41:44,499
Okay. Hand it over by tomorrow morning.

964
01:41:45,709 --> 01:41:46,710
What happened to the job?

965
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:48,678
Seenu and Salim have gone,
it'll be done.

966
01:41:49,212 --> 01:41:50,338
What will be done?

967
01:41:50,547 --> 01:41:52,716
Will you always be with Nandu?

968
01:41:52,716 --> 01:41:55,014
He has a lover, don't you feel
like giving him some privacy?

969
01:41:55,218 --> 01:41:57,345
Go.
- Pragathi, you wait.

970
01:41:57,554 --> 01:41:58,418
You stop.

971
01:42:00,223 --> 01:42:03,192
We've met after many days, don't you
want to spend an hour with me?

972
01:42:03,393 --> 01:42:06,760
lt seems they'll spend an
hour together, let's go.

973
01:42:08,732 --> 01:42:10,700
You go. You keep quiet.
- Be careful.

974
01:42:12,235 --> 01:42:13,361
Why are you angry Pragathi?

975
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:16,038
Won't you me some of your time?
- ls that your problem?

976
01:42:16,573 --> 01:42:17,369
Come here.

977
01:42:19,409 --> 01:42:22,037
When people come to me,

978
01:42:22,245 --> 01:42:23,712
we must be concerned about them, right?

979
01:42:24,414 --> 01:42:26,041
What can l do if you get
angry for everything?

980
01:42:48,772 --> 01:42:57,077
Brahma has tied a beautiful bond
between fruit and salt in the sea...

981
01:43:00,784 --> 01:43:09,158
He has united the clouds and
blue waters with a drop of rain...

982
01:43:13,129 --> 01:43:16,758
Chiselling a statue of soft cotton...

983
01:43:17,133 --> 01:43:20,762
Adorning with beautiful flowers...

984
01:43:21,137 --> 01:43:26,769
Brahma has united me with her...

985
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:30,768
He has united you and me...

986
01:43:31,147 --> 01:43:35,447
He played a trick to bring us
together again...

987
01:44:12,355 --> 01:44:20,490
What wasn't taught in school,
don't worry l'll share it in our bedroom...

988
01:44:24,367 --> 01:44:32,832
What's under the sari end isn't fear
or devotion but romance and love...

989
01:44:36,713 --> 01:44:40,884
With sweet bites of kisses
and eyes oozing with love...

990
01:44:40,884 --> 01:44:42,511
l'll lose myself to make you
a victor...

991
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:48,521
ln the battle of love...
with the weapons of gestures...

992
01:44:48,725 --> 01:44:52,525
l'll teach you new lessons of love...

993
01:44:52,729 --> 01:44:56,358
Learn the ABCD of romance...
- Let me write and learn by heart...

994
01:44:56,733 --> 01:45:02,694
Our romance is a school of love...

995
01:45:45,949 --> 01:45:54,254
Be my life companion and
unite with me to make me full...

996
01:45:57,961 --> 01:46:06,266
l'll sacrifice my life like a silk worm
to make a silk sari for you...

997
01:46:10,306 --> 01:46:14,265
Like every day is a festival
and rotating around the moon...

998
01:46:14,477 --> 01:46:16,274
l'll follow you...

999
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:22,281
l'll come into your life like sunny day
in the gloomy rainy days...

1000
01:46:22,485 --> 01:46:26,285
Let's seek solace in the
punishment of love...

1001
01:46:26,489 --> 01:46:30,289
Let's study the alphabets of love...

1002
01:46:30,493 --> 01:46:34,953
Let's teach a new lesson
of love every day...

1003
01:46:48,845 --> 01:46:49,971
Very sweet.

1004
01:46:50,847 --> 01:46:52,314
One who takes law into his hands,

1005
01:46:52,515 --> 01:46:55,382
for good or bad, he must face death.

1006
01:46:56,352 --> 01:46:59,981
l'll put and end card to him,
where is he now?

1007
01:47:00,523 --> 01:47:03,651
l'm very happy to visit temple
along with you.

1008
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:07,318
l never thought l would meet you
on your birthday.

1009
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:09,327
You left him.
- What?

1010
01:47:10,033 --> 01:47:13,002
He didn't come to meet you, he feared
you may join the monkey gang.

1011
01:47:16,039 --> 01:47:18,507
What happened Nandu?
- Look there!

1012
01:47:19,709 --> 01:47:22,337
Paidipalli race and name is Nandu.

1013
01:47:22,879 --> 01:47:27,009
Priest, it's my son's birthday
not some criminal's.

1014
01:47:28,384 --> 01:47:32,343
What's this? He shares his
birthday with Nandu.

1015
01:47:32,555 --> 01:47:34,523
Priest, offer prayers on both names.

1016
01:47:41,064 --> 01:47:43,066
Come, let's also offer prayers
and meet them.

1017
01:47:43,066 --> 01:47:46,627
l can't face them,
l came to see God,

1018
01:47:47,403 --> 01:47:50,702
l've seen my God,
that's enough for me.

1019
01:48:14,931 --> 01:48:16,057
What?

1020
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:20,900
l feel like my son is
somewhere here only.

1021
01:48:55,238 --> 01:49:00,699
Don't know which God's curse is this...

1022
01:49:00,977 --> 01:49:05,778
l'm right before your eyes...

1023
01:49:06,649 --> 01:49:12,451
Don't know which previous
life's sin are this...

1024
01:49:12,655 --> 01:49:17,786
l'm denied of your love...

1025
01:49:17,994 --> 01:49:24,126
Though fire of separation hurts
your parents...

1026
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:29,631
Though your wish doesn't give up
and your legs refuse to stop...

1027
01:49:29,839 --> 01:49:38,474
Have you stopped uttering the
word of mother?

1028
01:49:38,681 --> 01:49:44,483
On the tip of your tongue...

1029
01:50:09,212 --> 01:50:10,179
Please sit down.

1030
01:50:10,713 --> 01:50:14,581
When my friends are standing,
it's uncivil to sit, Officer.

1031
01:50:14,884 --> 01:50:17,220
Do you love your friends so much?
- They're my life.

1032
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:19,518
Who is this Bommali? Your lover?

1033
01:50:20,056 --> 01:50:20,920
Yes.

1034
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:27,230
People invite with a dot for
good auspicious functions.

1035
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:29,198
l'm also telling you after
putting a dot,

1036
01:50:30,066 --> 01:50:34,196
quit...quit everything you're doing.

1037
01:50:36,072 --> 01:50:38,540
You made many a people taste death.

1038
01:50:39,075 --> 01:50:40,599
l'll make you also taste death.

1039
01:50:41,911 --> 01:50:44,247
You're young, you've good friends,

1040
01:50:44,247 --> 01:50:46,875
you've a lover too,
you've everything,

1041
01:50:47,583 --> 01:50:49,050
quit this life of violence,

1042
01:50:50,586 --> 01:50:54,257
Salim, before this dot
becomes blood mark,

1043
01:50:54,257 --> 01:50:55,554
tell him to quit this
life of violence.

1044
01:50:55,758 --> 01:51:01,060
That's later.
Do your duty, l'll do my duty.

1045
01:51:33,829 --> 01:51:34,955
Please come in, sit down.

1046
01:51:35,164 --> 01:51:36,499
l don't have that habit.

1047
01:51:36,499 --> 01:51:38,797
lt seems police mustn't
enter this place,

1048
01:51:39,001 --> 01:51:41,469
if ever a police officer comes,
it must be your son only.

1049
01:51:42,338 --> 01:51:45,508
But didn't expect police would
come for your son, right?

1050
01:51:45,508 --> 01:51:48,136
The day my son started
fighting injustice,

1051
01:51:48,344 --> 01:51:51,313
l knew some day police would
come here for him.

1052
01:51:51,514 --> 01:51:55,143
l too didn't expect parents would
be proud of their goon son.

1053
01:51:55,351 --> 01:51:59,151
What your law failed to do if he
does it, are you calling him a goon?

1054
01:51:59,355 --> 01:52:03,526
Super! Entire family is supporting him.

1055
01:52:03,526 --> 01:52:06,495
How much money is he sending
for this big family?

1056
01:52:08,331 --> 01:52:11,129
One minute officer.
You please wait.

1057
01:52:20,843 --> 01:52:21,639
Open it.

1058
01:52:26,682 --> 01:52:31,142
See...Look at this!

1059
01:52:32,188 --> 01:52:34,357
Look at this closely!

1060
01:52:34,357 --> 01:52:36,154
What do you know to make wisecracks?

1061
01:52:36,359 --> 01:52:38,657
The car in which you came now,
if you go at 140 kms speed,

1062
01:52:38,861 --> 01:52:42,365
and travel for 18 minutes,
and when you look back,

1063
01:52:42,365 --> 01:52:45,664
the entire stretch of green fields
you see belongs to my son.

1064
01:52:46,369 --> 01:52:49,668
This family has donated thousands
of acres of land for the poor,

1065
01:52:49,872 --> 01:52:54,002
he told us to donate entire property on
his name to the poor and needy,

1066
01:52:54,377 --> 01:52:56,845
would he send money to us every month?

1067
01:52:57,213 --> 01:53:00,011
My son is a born billionaire.

1068
01:53:01,050 --> 01:53:05,009
l wanted him to become
a police officer,

1069
01:53:05,221 --> 01:53:08,019
he stood first in state and
topped civil service exam,

1070
01:53:08,224 --> 01:53:11,193
you've the evidence for it there.

1071
01:53:15,898 --> 01:53:18,401
So, your son is a good
with certificates.

1072
01:53:18,401 --> 01:53:22,405
You call him a goon and
people call him as brother.

1073
01:53:22,405 --> 01:53:26,705
Goons who live on people and
my son who lives for people

1074
01:53:26,909 --> 01:53:28,706
there's lot of difference
between them.

1075
01:53:28,911 --> 01:53:36,374
Our state has 773980 constables,

1076
01:53:36,752 --> 01:53:41,424
24660 Circle lnspectors,

1077
01:53:41,424 --> 01:53:44,882
1700 ACP's,

1078
01:53:45,094 --> 01:53:48,063
and to regulate them lG's and DGP.

1079
01:53:48,264 --> 01:53:52,894
When so many police officers are working
day and night to protect law and order,

1080
01:53:53,102 --> 01:53:54,399
but still failing to control the crime.

1081
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:56,397
ls your son controlling it?

1082
01:53:57,273 --> 01:54:00,401
Law and constitution failed to deliver it.

1083
01:54:00,776 --> 01:54:03,404
What can your son do it?

1084
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,748
He was this much earlier,
then he was this much,

1085
01:54:06,949 --> 01:54:08,451
today how much he has grown,

1086
01:54:08,451 --> 01:54:10,749
can be judged by the force
that had come here for him.

1087
01:54:22,965 --> 01:54:25,433
lf you can quote an outdated law,

1088
01:54:25,801 --> 01:54:28,099
he's responding to people's
problems voluntarily,

1089
01:54:28,304 --> 01:54:31,102
unable to wait till he gets
to wear the khaki uniform,

1090
01:54:31,307 --> 01:54:32,934
he has started discharging his duty.

1091
01:54:33,309 --> 01:54:36,107
He has no boundaries like
your police station limits.

1092
01:54:36,312 --> 01:54:39,281
Wherever injustice happens,
Nandheeshwarudu will be there.

1093
01:54:41,317 --> 01:54:42,511
He's a boss to himself.

1094
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,446
Tell him to leave it.

1095
01:54:46,489 --> 01:54:48,787
l don't mind whether he goes
to Kasi or Kashmir,

1096
01:54:48,991 --> 01:54:51,459
if not you'll be left with
his memories only.

1097
01:54:52,495 --> 01:54:57,194
lf you refuse, be ready,
to receive his body.

1098
01:54:59,502 --> 01:55:00,969
Are you threatening us?

1099
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:04,507
We've the courage to bear
his death too.

1100
01:55:04,507 --> 01:55:07,135
We're ready for life without him also.

1101
01:55:07,343 --> 01:55:12,144
Ask your family if they're ready
for a life without you.

1102
01:55:12,348 --> 01:55:13,474
Then you can go after my son.

1103
01:55:13,849 --> 01:55:15,476
From the day l joined duty...

1104
01:55:19,021 --> 01:55:20,318
One minute please.

1105
01:55:20,856 --> 01:55:24,155
We used to serve food to
any guest to this home,

1106
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:26,487
at least have buttermilk.

1107
01:55:30,032 --> 01:55:34,833
How ever one may be born,
nobody knows how he would die.

1108
01:55:35,037 --> 01:55:41,169
l proud of giving birth to a son
who is dying for his people.

1109
01:55:42,044 --> 01:55:44,512
lf you feel my son is doing wrong,

1110
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:49,017
do whatever you feel is justice.

1111
01:56:19,582 --> 01:56:21,209
Greetings officer!

1112
01:56:21,417 --> 01:56:23,214
He's saluting his death !

1113
01:56:25,254 --> 01:56:26,881
Keep your poetic heart within yourself.

1114
01:56:27,423 --> 01:56:29,220
l like you very much.

1115
01:56:29,925 --> 01:56:32,223
You went to his home and
gave him a warning.

1116
01:56:32,428 --> 01:56:35,886
Hats off to your sincerity.

1117
01:56:36,265 --> 01:56:39,894
You've proved your worth for
selecting and bringing you here.

1118
01:56:40,102 --> 01:56:44,903
You keep supporting us like this,
we'll also support you.

1119
01:56:46,609 --> 01:56:47,405
Boss!

1120
01:56:51,947 --> 01:56:53,244
Take it officer!

1121
01:57:00,289 --> 01:57:01,916
Don't misjudge that l've spared you.

1122
01:57:02,625 --> 01:57:07,085
The operation has just begun.
lmpossible to stop it.

1123
01:57:07,963 --> 01:57:12,093
Elimination will start with him
and end with you.

1124
01:57:12,301 --> 01:57:14,929
Go!...

1125
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:41,653
l expected this! You would come
searching your death.

1126
01:57:42,665 --> 01:57:45,293
Though l've come,
you need courage to kill me.

1127
01:57:45,668 --> 01:57:49,468
l knew you don't have it the moment
you went to my home for me.

1128
01:57:52,174 --> 01:57:53,641
You know the game of chess, right?

1129
01:57:54,343 --> 01:57:55,970
King can't checkmate King.

1130
01:57:57,012 --> 01:57:58,479
We must checkmate the
people around him first.

1131
01:57:58,681 --> 01:58:01,149
You're committing blunder there.

1132
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:04,979
lt's not wrong to fire coal.

1133
01:58:05,187 --> 01:58:09,317
Don't try to add fuel to fire,
it'll burn you.

1134
01:58:09,525 --> 01:58:12,983
l'm elder to you so l'll quote
an old proverb.

1135
01:58:13,195 --> 01:58:16,323
lron can be bent only when it's hot.

1136
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:21,704
l know when and where l can bend you.
- What do you know?

1137
01:58:21,704 --> 01:58:24,673
Other than giving the account
of bullets given to you.

1138
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:29,340
Great! l met your family,
and l've met you here.

1139
01:58:29,545 --> 01:58:33,504
Same pride! Same adventurous!
l'll tie you down.

1140
01:58:33,716 --> 01:58:40,019
You went to my home
to complain about me,

1141
01:58:40,222 --> 01:58:43,350
how can you tie me down?
You can't do it.

1142
01:58:43,559 --> 01:58:47,188
Only l can do it.
l wanted to give you a chance.

1143
01:58:47,396 --> 01:58:50,695
l know only to give chances
not to take.

1144
01:58:51,066 --> 01:58:53,193
You'll know it in future.

1145
01:58:53,402 --> 01:58:56,739
l'll squeeze out blood from your veins
and show you the gory of death.

1146
01:58:56,739 --> 01:59:01,369
Before death faces me,
before this body reaches the bier,

1147
01:59:01,577 --> 01:59:07,038
l'll kill every man who
wished my death.

1148
01:59:07,249 --> 01:59:08,216
You're brave!

1149
01:59:09,752 --> 01:59:13,711
My sixth sense says you're brave
enough to match my ability.

1150
01:59:14,089 --> 01:59:15,716
Not brave but pride!

1151
01:59:16,091 --> 01:59:19,720
When law and justice is bending
backwards to please unjust people,

1152
01:59:20,095 --> 01:59:23,064
l'm roaring like a lion
against this injustice.

1153
01:59:23,265 --> 01:59:27,065
My seventh sense has opened.
Don't cross my path.

1154
01:59:27,269 --> 01:59:30,238
You'll get burnt.
Reduced to ashes.

1155
01:59:36,612 --> 01:59:38,739
Your wish to kill me.

1156
02:00:01,303 --> 02:00:03,271
Nandheeshwarudu escapes
from a bomb attack.

1157
02:00:04,306 --> 02:00:06,433
ln the attack his car was
blown into smithereens.

1158
02:00:06,642 --> 02:00:09,812
Police are trying to find the attackers.
- You can hear it, right?

1159
02:00:09,812 --> 02:00:12,815
There's information that his
followers are safe.

1160
02:00:12,815 --> 02:00:16,774
There's information with police about
war between Baba and Nandu.

1161
02:00:21,657 --> 02:00:25,286
Though we're alert,
we've been attacked.

1162
02:00:25,661 --> 02:00:29,461
Earlier in the orphanage
and now while travelling.

1163
02:00:29,665 --> 02:00:32,133
How could others know
our movements?

1164
02:00:32,334 --> 02:00:34,837
Are you suspecting me?

1165
02:00:34,837 --> 02:00:38,796
lf l suspect you,
it's like suspecting myself.- Then?

1166
02:00:39,341 --> 02:00:42,640
Suspect and keep an eye
on the enemy.

1167
02:00:42,845 --> 02:00:47,145
We must be like lion on hunt
not sleeping bison.

1168
02:00:47,683 --> 02:00:49,810
Think over why is it happening?

1169
02:01:02,197 --> 02:01:03,164
Please come in.

1170
02:01:06,368 --> 02:01:07,164
Please sit down.

1171
02:01:12,541 --> 02:01:15,169
Can you get me a glass of water?

1172
02:01:15,377 --> 02:01:18,346
Get a glass of water.
- Okay.

1173
02:01:19,715 --> 02:01:22,343
Mother, get one coffee.
- okay.

1174
02:01:24,386 --> 02:01:28,186
You are...?
- l'm Judge Sathyamurthy.

1175
02:01:28,891 --> 02:01:31,519
l know. Please tell me
what brings you here?

1176
02:01:32,394 --> 02:01:36,353
l want justice.
- Justice?

1177
02:01:36,899 --> 02:01:39,527
You're a judge,
you want justice from me?

1178
02:01:39,735 --> 02:01:42,905
l'm a judge but l've lost to injustice.

1179
02:01:42,905 --> 02:01:45,373
That's why for justice,
l've come to you.

1180
02:01:45,574 --> 02:01:46,871
l didn't get you.

1181
02:01:50,913 --> 02:01:52,881
Before sentencing you,

1182
02:01:53,582 --> 02:01:55,880
l had sentenced two criminals
with capital punishment.

1183
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:05,885
Who are you?

1184
02:02:06,261 --> 02:02:10,391
You sent us to jail changing
our fates with your pen, right?

1185
02:02:10,599 --> 02:02:13,568
You committed crime and must
be in jail, how come you're out?

1186
02:02:13,769 --> 02:02:18,570
Did you punish us knowing
we're nephews of Home Minister?

1187
02:02:18,774 --> 02:02:20,571
Did you punish us
without knowing it?

1188
02:02:20,776 --> 02:02:23,745
When l sit in my court
to do justice,

1189
02:02:23,946 --> 02:02:26,744
l don't care about relationships
of the criminals.

1190
02:02:29,451 --> 02:02:34,957
You believe witnesses to punish,
we trust money to commit crimes.

1191
02:02:34,957 --> 02:02:38,586
Now the same money will
decide punishment to you.

1192
02:02:38,794 --> 02:02:42,423
lf it's head, you and
if it's tail, your wife.

1193
02:02:42,631 --> 02:02:44,599
What will you do?
Will you kill us?

1194
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:46,427
Toss it.

1195
02:02:47,636 --> 02:02:48,762
Tail!

1196
02:03:08,991 --> 02:03:11,789
l'm a retired judge.

1197
02:03:11,994 --> 02:03:16,954
l must be looking for my pension
but had to wait for justice.

1198
02:03:17,332 --> 02:03:19,300
What do you really want from me?

1199
02:03:20,502 --> 02:03:21,696
Jungle justice!

1200
02:03:26,675 --> 02:03:30,304
l'm not asking you to punish
them for killing my wife.

1201
02:03:30,512 --> 02:03:35,814
lf we spare them they may
kill many more people,

1202
02:03:36,018 --> 02:03:41,479
Lord Krishna said in Gita
to protect good and punish evil.

1203
02:03:42,024 --> 02:03:45,653
l take oath on Gita to
tell the truth,

1204
02:03:45,861 --> 02:03:47,988
l've read that line,

1205
02:03:49,031 --> 02:03:49,998
the decision is yours.

1206
02:03:55,037 --> 02:03:57,335
lf you're a criminal for killing them,

1207
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:00,668
then Lord Krishna is also
a culprit for killing Kamsa,

1208
02:04:00,876 --> 02:04:03,344
even Lord Rama is also
a culprit for killing Ravana.

1209
02:04:04,546 --> 02:04:05,513
Bye son.

1210
02:06:29,691 --> 02:06:31,215
Come!

1211
02:06:31,693 --> 02:06:32,660
Move!

1212
02:06:34,196 --> 02:06:35,493
Where is Nandu?

1213
02:06:35,697 --> 02:06:37,164
Nandu? Who is Nandu?

1214
02:06:37,532 --> 02:06:39,500
l saw him hanging that man.

1215
02:06:39,701 --> 02:06:41,498
l don't know sir.
- You know.

1216
02:06:41,703 --> 02:06:44,206
You've seen him.
Just one witness is enough.

1217
02:06:44,206 --> 02:06:45,503
We're saying we don't know sir.

1218
02:06:45,707 --> 02:06:47,834
You're supporting and
protecting a criminal.

1219
02:06:48,043 --> 02:06:51,672
You say criminal and
we say he's god.- Who said that?

1220
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:53,848
Nobody is ready to tell about him.

1221
02:06:54,049 --> 02:06:55,846
You may not tell but
some day l'll catch him.

1222
02:06:56,051 --> 02:06:57,177
l'll send him to jail.

1223
02:06:57,619 --> 02:07:01,578
lf criminals who should be
in jail roam outside, and get killed,

1224
02:07:02,457 --> 02:07:06,257
are you collecting evidence
about the killer?

1225
02:07:06,962 --> 02:07:07,587
ls he a criminal?

1226
02:07:08,563 --> 02:07:13,023
For raping and killing three
innocent girls,

1227
02:07:13,235 --> 02:07:15,703
l sentenced them to death.

1228
02:07:16,738 --> 02:07:19,866
They came to my home
when they should be in jail,

1229
02:07:20,075 --> 02:07:23,203
seeking revenge on me they hanged
my wife as l stood watching.

1230
02:07:24,246 --> 02:07:26,248
Are you wearing this uniform
to protect such criminals?

1231
02:07:26,248 --> 02:07:30,252
What's this?
What's happening in this city?

1232
02:07:30,252 --> 02:07:31,549
What are you all doing?

1233
02:07:31,753 --> 02:07:33,550
What happened sir?
- You don't talk to me.

1234
02:07:33,755 --> 02:07:35,723
Will you hang and kill judge's wife?

1235
02:07:35,924 --> 02:07:40,884
You're encouraging them to amass
wealth and ruining this city.

1236
02:07:41,096 --> 02:07:46,268
You've been given power not to
make money and do as you wish.

1237
02:07:46,268 --> 02:07:48,236
No sir.
- Don't talk.

1238
02:07:48,770 --> 02:07:50,897
What are you doing, DGP?

1239
02:07:51,106 --> 02:07:54,564
lnstead of eliminating such criminals,
are you protecting them?

1240
02:07:54,776 --> 02:07:56,278
No sir...
- Yuck...

1241
02:07:56,278 --> 02:07:58,576
l think you've been given
wrong information.

1242
02:07:58,780 --> 02:08:01,248
Wrong information? Don't talk.

1243
02:08:02,284 --> 02:08:06,243
l've complete evidence of
all your misdeeds.

1244
02:08:07,789 --> 02:08:10,758
l'm ordering CBl inquiry,
they'll take care of the things.

1245
02:08:10,959 --> 02:08:16,261
No! l'm suspending you all from
your posts and party membership.

1246
02:08:16,631 --> 02:08:19,600
No sir...
- You may go.

1247
02:08:24,139 --> 02:08:25,936
They would've taken the vehicle
also along with post,

1248
02:08:26,141 --> 02:08:29,599
can l give you lift?
- No, we'll manage.

1249
02:08:29,811 --> 02:08:34,612
How about a chocolate?
- Keep it, you may need it.

1250
02:08:45,327 --> 02:08:46,294
How are you doing?

1251
02:08:46,661 --> 02:08:48,629
l don't know how you do it
as the new DGP,

1252
02:08:48,830 --> 02:08:50,297
l'm giving you full power,

1253
02:08:51,333 --> 02:08:54,700
flush out the criminals from
this city in 48 hours.

1254
02:08:58,673 --> 02:08:59,298
Sit down.

1255
02:09:01,176 --> 02:09:02,143
Would you like to have coffee?

1256
02:09:02,844 --> 02:09:07,645
When goons and rogues are
making people sleepless,

1257
02:09:07,849 --> 02:09:09,316
are you sleeping peacefully, Easwar?

1258
02:09:10,185 --> 02:09:11,652
l don't need to tell you again,

1259
02:09:12,354 --> 02:09:15,983
if you give unlimited power to
any officer to catch the goons,

1260
02:09:16,191 --> 02:09:24,997
police can flush out goons not only
from this city but entire country.

1261
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:28,169
l'm giving you full power,
show me what you can do.

1262
02:09:28,370 --> 02:09:30,065
The countdown has started now.

1263
02:09:31,373 --> 02:09:38,006
l'll make every goon to pee in fear
and have it cleaned by himself.

1264
02:09:38,213 --> 02:09:40,841
l'll clean up this city in 24 hours.

1265
02:09:41,049 --> 02:09:43,017
l'll play ball with them!

1266
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:16,418
Sir....who are you sir?

1267
02:10:16,418 --> 02:10:19,717
What search? lf my brother
hears it, he'll get angry.

1268
02:10:19,921 --> 02:10:22,048
Boy! Did you watch film 'Dookudu'?
lsn't it super?

1269
02:10:22,257 --> 02:10:24,225
What's this rashness?
You're barging into home.

1270
02:10:24,426 --> 02:10:28,385
Not just the home, live entered
your brother's life. Watch out!

1271
02:10:30,932 --> 02:10:33,901
Sir, please don't go inside.
My brother will get angry.

1272
02:10:34,102 --> 02:10:37,128
Please go out...please...
l'm telling you sir.

1273
02:10:43,445 --> 02:10:45,470
He's not in home, sir.
We searched entire home.

1274
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:46,405
Not here?

1275
02:10:53,455 --> 02:10:54,922
Give the phone to Nandu.

1276
02:11:07,802 --> 02:11:08,427
Okay.

1277
02:11:10,972 --> 02:11:12,439
What happened, Nandu?

1278
02:11:12,807 --> 02:11:16,106
Easwara is killing every
goon in the city.

1279
02:11:16,478 --> 02:11:18,275
He has sealed our house too.

1280
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:20,777
l'm his next target.

1281
02:11:21,316 --> 02:11:22,283
Where are you going?

1282
02:11:23,318 --> 02:11:27,778
lf we give little time to the enemy,
he'll change the plan,

1283
02:11:27,989 --> 02:11:31,948
l don't have any other way
than this to save you.

1284
02:11:32,327 --> 02:11:35,497
Stop Nandu, haste isn't good
at such time.

1285
02:11:35,497 --> 02:11:36,964
Think over it.

1286
02:11:37,165 --> 02:11:38,291
lt's not safe for you to venture out.

1287
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:40,127
l took to violence for people,

1288
02:11:40,335 --> 02:11:42,963
do you want me to quit from
the declared war for selfish end?

1289
02:11:43,171 --> 02:11:47,972
Easwar is closing all the routes,
l'll talk to him.

1290
02:11:49,511 --> 02:11:50,978
l don't want you to go alone.

1291
02:11:51,179 --> 02:11:52,806
One must go alone to negotiate.

1292
02:11:58,019 --> 02:12:01,978
You must be safe, people need you.

1293
02:12:02,524 --> 02:12:03,491
Nothing will happen to me.

1294
02:12:07,862 --> 02:12:12,322
Kill him...
- Please listen to me sir.

1295
02:12:12,534 --> 02:12:12,829
Kill him...

1296
02:12:13,034 --> 02:12:16,834
l'm here to surrender.
l want to meet Easwara Prasad.

1297
02:12:17,038 --> 02:12:18,164
Do you want to meet Easwar?

1298
02:12:18,373 --> 02:12:19,499
Come and meet him.

1299
02:12:21,543 --> 02:12:23,841
Please forgive me sir.

1300
02:12:24,045 --> 02:12:27,014
Why are you holding my legs
instead of collar?

1301
02:12:27,215 --> 02:12:29,342
l've got sense sir.

1302
02:12:29,551 --> 02:12:30,848
But your leader hasn't yet got it.

1303
02:12:31,052 --> 02:12:33,850
He'll also get it, sir.
l'll go and bring them to you, sir.

1304
02:12:34,055 --> 02:12:37,513
l don't believe a man eating tiger
and a killer would change.

1305
02:12:37,892 --> 02:12:41,521
Sir, if you promise not to kill,
l'll present them before you.

1306
02:12:41,896 --> 02:12:43,864
First bring them, keep your promise.

1307
02:12:44,065 --> 02:12:46,033
Then, l'll keep my promise. Go!

1308
02:12:46,234 --> 02:12:49,533
Thank you sir, l promise on Allah.
l'll bring them all.

1309
02:12:53,575 --> 02:12:54,872
Why did you leave him, sir?

1310
02:12:55,076 --> 02:12:58,045
To hunt the tiger you must
spare the goat.

1311
02:12:58,246 --> 02:13:03,548
To catch Nandu,
we can leave such rogues.

1312
02:13:06,254 --> 02:13:10,281
Baba, you must trust me.
- Why should l trust you?

1313
02:13:11,092 --> 02:13:15,392
Bloody! You planned to bump me
off turning as approver, right?

1314
02:13:15,597 --> 02:13:18,225
No Baba! Please listen to me.

1315
02:13:18,433 --> 02:13:23,962
Though l'm a police officer,
l work for Baba.

1316
02:13:30,612 --> 02:13:34,412
l'm an emperor in politics.

1317
02:13:34,949 --> 02:13:37,417
Baba is emperor of rowdyism.

1318
02:13:37,952 --> 02:13:39,920
How dare you cheat us!

1319
02:13:45,293 --> 02:13:47,420
How dare you betray me!

1320
02:13:48,963 --> 02:13:52,922
That's why l'm killing you
without offering water also!

1321
02:14:00,975 --> 02:14:06,436
Try to live hiding from Nandu.

1322
02:14:08,149 --> 02:14:12,279
Nandu will attack Easwar now,

1323
02:14:12,487 --> 02:14:16,947
one of the two would die,
and l'll kill who ever survives.

1324
02:14:17,659 --> 02:14:18,626
Go!

1325
02:14:26,501 --> 02:14:27,126
He's dead, boss.

1326
02:14:28,336 --> 02:14:30,133
Let's mourn with 2 minute silence.

1327
02:14:31,673 --> 02:14:39,478
To render justice whenever
injustice takes over,

1328
02:14:39,681 --> 02:14:41,649
l'll come to do justice.

1329
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:20,722
My looks are hot chilly...

1330
02:15:20,722 --> 02:15:22,519
My body is fiery chilly...

1331
02:15:22,724 --> 02:15:26,353
Taste this lovely savoury...

1332
02:15:26,561 --> 02:15:32,022
Chilly...chilly...mouth watering chilly...

1333
02:15:32,233 --> 02:15:35,691
My youth is hot chilly...
My beauty is red hot chilly...

1334
02:15:36,070 --> 02:15:39,741
Take me and have me...

1335
02:15:39,741 --> 02:15:45,202
Chilly...alluring chilly...

1336
02:15:45,580 --> 02:15:53,043
There's fire passion in me...
you've masculine water to douse it...

1337
02:15:53,254 --> 02:15:59,056
Come douse it...

1338
02:15:59,260 --> 02:16:03,560
l'm raging with fire,
come douse it...

1339
02:16:04,599 --> 02:16:16,238
Come...come...take me...
O my dear...

1340
02:16:31,793 --> 02:16:41,600
Red hot chilly...your hotness will rake
up passions and make us go mad...

1341
02:16:50,478 --> 02:16:56,110
Look at my tender soft cheeks,
they're cakes...sponge cakes...

1342
02:16:56,317 --> 02:17:01,619
You're a chilly that rakes up passion...
You're a mouth watering hot chilly...

1343
02:17:01,823 --> 02:17:07,455
Look at my tender petal like lips...
lt's exotic sweets...

1344
02:17:07,662 --> 02:17:12,463
A chilly that excites us...
Let's have a bite...

1345
02:17:12,667 --> 02:17:18,840
My kisses are mesmerizing...

1346
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:24,472
Your brains go crashing for
my tantalizing touches...

1347
02:17:24,679 --> 02:17:28,308
To say it's exotic item...

1348
02:17:28,516 --> 02:17:36,321
Once you taste it,
it's purely country item...

1349
02:18:23,905 --> 02:18:29,605
Darling, my sexy waist is banana...
Pluck it...

1350
02:18:34,582 --> 02:18:40,885
Chew away all the wealth of
my youth...have a got at it...

1351
02:18:46,928 --> 02:18:57,896
Measure and explore my beauty...
Dance with me...

1352
02:18:58,272 --> 02:19:08,910
Loot my beauty and youth...
Melt away time in my arms...

1353
02:19:41,482 --> 02:19:42,949
Let's take him to hospital!

1354
02:19:43,985 --> 02:19:45,987
Nandu, first listen to me.

1355
02:19:45,987 --> 02:19:48,285
Who would dare to fight me?

1356
02:19:49,657 --> 02:19:52,785
Baba and Home Minister killed me.

1357
02:19:52,994 --> 02:19:55,622
l don't know if my daughter
is alive or not,

1358
02:19:55,830 --> 02:19:58,958
but he tried to make me kill you,

1359
02:20:23,858 --> 02:20:24,324
Tell me Salim.

1360
02:20:24,525 --> 02:20:25,651
Tell the driver to slow down the car.
- Why?

1361
02:20:25,860 --> 02:20:27,054
Tell him to slow down.

1362
02:20:29,864 --> 02:20:31,491
l love my daughter.

1363
02:20:33,034 --> 02:20:37,664
But they don't know that l love
you more than my daughter.

1364
02:20:38,873 --> 02:20:41,000
lf l kill you for my daughter,

1365
02:20:41,375 --> 02:20:45,835
hundreds of Babas will crop up.

1366
02:20:46,047 --> 02:20:50,848
But you're one of kind man !

1367
02:20:51,552 --> 02:20:56,012
That's why l acted like l'm their man.

1368
02:20:56,891 --> 02:21:02,523
lf l refuse they'll try to entice
someone else to do it.

1369
02:21:03,564 --> 02:21:07,364
That's why l always saved you.

1370
02:21:08,402 --> 02:21:16,036
Just now l realized how happy one
would be to sacrifice life for a friend.

1371
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:20,877
Take care of Nandu.

1372
02:21:21,082 --> 02:21:23,050
We'll take care of him, Salim bhai.

1373
02:21:34,595 --> 02:21:40,556
We met like orphans,
we lived like friends but now...

1374
02:21:54,115 --> 02:21:56,413
l'm ready for the operation, uncle.

1375
02:21:56,617 --> 02:21:57,584
Aren't you scared?

1376
02:21:57,785 --> 02:21:59,412
You're there with me, right uncle?

1377
02:27:41,295 --> 02:27:42,421
Don't kill me please.

1378
02:27:43,964 --> 02:27:45,932
Call...call...

1379
02:27:46,300 --> 02:27:52,432
Let me see the goons you hired or
violence you encouraged would save. Call!

1380
02:27:52,973 --> 02:27:57,933
Your gory death must reform
every corrupt politician.

1381
02:27:58,979 --> 02:28:02,437
This must be people's justice
to goons like you.

1382
02:28:09,490 --> 02:28:14,792
Didn't l tell you?
You got caught red handed.

1383
02:28:16,330 --> 02:28:17,126
Come.

1384
02:28:43,524 --> 02:28:45,822
Poosamuthu, remove the handcuffs.

1385
02:28:53,033 --> 02:28:55,501
Nandu, go away.

1386
02:28:57,538 --> 02:28:59,836
Why are you surprized?
Go away.

1387
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:04,170
You were dying to catch us
but now you're asking us to go.

1388
02:29:05,045 --> 02:29:06,012
What are you up to?

1389
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:09,348
There's shoot at sight order on you,
tell him Poosamuthu.

1390
02:29:09,550 --> 02:29:10,847
Any other officer would've killed you.

1391
02:29:11,051 --> 02:29:14,350
That's why l brought you here
and asking you to go. lsn't it?

1392
02:29:14,555 --> 02:29:18,514
Yes, sir little crazy,
go away before he changes his mind.

1393
02:29:20,227 --> 02:29:23,025
Nothing, if l arrest and
take you to court,

1394
02:29:23,230 --> 02:29:26,358
and you'll come out on bail,
it's long process for good man like you,

1395
02:29:26,567 --> 02:29:27,534
that's why l'm asking you
to go away.

1396
02:29:27,901 --> 02:29:30,369
No sir, don't try to convince me.

1397
02:29:30,571 --> 02:29:31,538
Why don't you listen to me?

1398
02:29:31,905 --> 02:29:33,532
l'll get his approval.

1399
02:29:34,575 --> 02:29:37,578
He's making me lose my cool,
advice him.

1400
02:29:37,578 --> 02:29:42,880
l'm responsible for everything
that had happened till now.

1401
02:29:43,083 --> 02:29:46,382
lf you want us to escape,
allow my friends to leave first,

1402
02:29:46,587 --> 02:29:47,884
l'm ready to die.

1403
02:29:48,088 --> 02:29:51,387
All of you go away.
l'll go to jail.

1404
02:29:52,092 --> 02:29:53,559
l can't do so many sacrifices.

1405
02:29:53,927 --> 02:29:56,054
l'll send them to jail saying
you managed to escape.

1406
02:29:56,263 --> 02:29:57,890
l'll release them later.
Go away.

1407
02:29:58,098 --> 02:30:02,558
Nandu, you go away. You must go.
- Yes Nandu. You must go away.

1408
02:30:02,936 --> 02:30:05,606
This life is your gift.
Please go away, Nandu.

1409
02:30:05,606 --> 02:30:09,235
Mother would be waiting for you,
promise on our friendship.

1410
02:30:10,611 --> 02:30:12,579
Never promise on friendship,

1411
02:30:15,115 --> 02:30:16,412
okay, l'll go for your sake,

1412
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:23,089
take care of my friends.

1413
02:30:43,644 --> 02:30:44,611
Go away.

1414
02:30:44,978 --> 02:30:48,607
Take care.
- You take care.- Go.

1415
02:30:48,982 --> 02:30:54,113
Go away Nandu.- Go away!
- Go Nandu !- Go away Nandu !

1416
02:31:09,169 --> 02:31:13,697
Sir, you're not crazy but
a good police officer.

1417
02:31:30,190 --> 02:31:32,988
Just one shot only, l've to narrate
a tale to department, right?

1418
02:31:33,193 --> 02:31:34,490
You carry on...go...

1419
02:31:35,696 --> 02:31:38,164
You go, nothing will happen to us, go.

1420
02:31:38,365 --> 02:31:44,497
Go! Don't think...go...
- Go!

1421
02:31:50,711 --> 02:31:53,339
How many times l've to tell you,
we've certain rules!

1422
02:31:53,547 --> 02:31:55,174
Go...go...go...

1423
02:31:57,050 --> 02:31:59,678
Go away Nandu !
- Go...go...

1424
02:32:00,053 --> 02:32:02,021
Go away Nandu !

1425
02:32:02,723 --> 02:32:08,525
Go...go...don't think...go!

1426
02:32:08,729 --> 02:32:10,196
Go Nandu...go...

1427
02:32:16,069 --> 02:32:17,696
You go Nandu...you carry on.

1428
02:32:19,072 --> 02:32:20,369
l'll take them to the hospital.

1429
02:32:20,574 --> 02:32:26,747
Go...go away Nandu, we'll be fine.

1430
02:32:26,747 --> 02:32:28,044
Go...go...

1431
02:32:28,248 --> 02:32:31,376
Don't think about us.

1432
02:32:34,254 --> 02:32:37,223
Don't look back, go away.

1433
02:32:37,424 --> 02:32:42,054
We'll be fine, you go away.

1434
02:33:31,645 --> 02:33:32,441
What happened?

1435
02:33:36,817 --> 02:33:40,446
l had a bad dream of
someone killing our son.

1436
02:33:42,322 --> 02:33:43,448
Nothing like that would happen.

1437
02:33:43,657 --> 02:33:45,625
He'll be fine.
Go to sleep.

1438
02:33:54,835 --> 02:33:56,803
A small twist in the climax.

1439
02:33:57,838 --> 02:34:00,807
Though good people commit
a mistake, it's still a mistake.

1440
02:34:01,174 --> 02:34:03,301
Another Baba will sprout up in future,

1441
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:05,846
inspired by you,
another Nanda will appear,

1442
02:34:05,846 --> 02:34:07,643
if you fight and kill each other,

1443
02:34:07,848 --> 02:34:10,476
why should there be police
and officers like me?

1444
02:34:12,185 --> 02:34:17,487
You can do anything with law
but never take it into your hands.

1445
02:34:17,691 --> 02:34:18,859
You'll die!

1446
02:34:18,859 --> 02:34:21,157
Did you see?

1447
02:34:21,862 --> 02:34:25,161
l can still the confidence in his eyes
even after death that he wasn't wrong.

1448
02:34:32,873 --> 02:34:36,331
Two years later...

1449
02:34:37,377 --> 02:34:39,675
Goons are ruling the roost in Bihar!

1450
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:41,677
lt's very difficult to control them.

1451
02:34:41,882 --> 02:34:44,180
l've selected a dynamic officer to do it.

1452
02:34:44,384 --> 02:34:46,181
l've selected him,

1453
02:34:46,386 --> 02:34:50,186
because he cleaned
Andhra Pradesh of all the goons,

1454
02:34:50,390 --> 02:34:54,349
he's the officer,
Mr.Easwara Prasad from AP,

1455
02:34:54,561 --> 02:34:58,190
l don't know how you do it, l want you
to make Bihar also clean like Andhra.

1456
02:34:58,398 --> 02:35:03,529
To make Bihar like Andhra,
l need the support of Nandi!

1457
02:35:03,737 --> 02:35:05,204
That Nandheeshwarudu !

1458
02:35:20,587 --> 02:35:23,385
l don't know you both would do it,

1459
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:24,887
l'm giving you full power.

1460
02:35:29,930 --> 02:35:30,726
Why?

1461
02:35:30,931 --> 02:35:34,230
My life should've ended but
you gave me a new lease of life.

1462
02:35:34,434 --> 02:35:38,939
To tell you the truth,
l took your case very seriously,

1463
02:35:38,939 --> 02:35:42,568
l understood you're a good man
after taking up the case,

1464
02:35:42,776 --> 02:35:46,405
l'm feeling proud of making a man
like you a police officer.

1465
02:35:46,613 --> 02:35:49,582
l didn't aim at you outside the court.
That man !

1466
02:35:49,783 --> 02:35:52,411
Had l wanted to kill you,
l would've shot in your chest.

1467
02:35:52,619 --> 02:35:53,916
Not in your stomach.

1468
02:35:54,287 --> 02:35:56,414
Till now you carried unlicensed revolver,

1469
02:35:59,292 --> 02:36:03,752
with the same rage, anger and courage,
cleans the society of all the goons.

1470
02:36:04,631 --> 02:36:06,258
l'll definitely do it, sir.

1471
02:36:21,314 --> 02:36:21,939
Mother!

1472
02:36:25,986 --> 02:36:26,953
Father!

1473
02:36:34,995 --> 02:36:35,996
Greetings.

1474
02:36:35,996 --> 02:36:39,625
What l thought was justice, l did it.

1475
02:36:50,677 --> 02:36:53,013
They worked hard and
l made them officers,

1476
02:36:53,013 --> 02:36:53,980
what did you achieve?

1477
02:36:54,347 --> 02:36:57,646
l married after a great struggle,
