1
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:50,800
'Megamalai'

2
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:01,342
Having separate connections
for both the houses is such a pain

3
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,437
Till now whatever I have said is
the 1st limitation of my invention

4
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:50,248
This machine capable of
magical wonders...

5
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,742
...has a 2nd constraint

6
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:55,406
What I mean is...

7
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:56,678
...its limit

8
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,193
An extremely crucial one

9
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,505
Let me tell you abou-

10
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:02,995
It will wor-

11
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,733
Say 'hello' to your father

12
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,961
He doesn't want
you and me, right?

13
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,940
This laboratory is
his whole world, right?

14
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:15,381
Tell your father

15
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:24,221
Priya

16
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,746
Is this a playground?

17
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:29,143
How many times have I told you
not to bring the baby here?

18
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:30,414
This is full of chemicals

19
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:33,064
Imagine if even a drop
falls on you or our baby?

20
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:34,781
I didn't topple anything

21
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,659
All your son's fault...!

22
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:40,100
He has come here to give a gift
to his dad with so much love!

23
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,098
And you're scolding us

24
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,463
Priya, watch your ste-

25
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,169
'Let us not give your father
even a single gift'

26
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:47,664
Shall we keep all the gifts?

27
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,330
Priya...?

28
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,749
You mentioned a gift

29
00:03:53,954 --> 00:03:56,037
And then you walked off in a huff

30
00:03:56,276 --> 00:03:57,443
What was the gift?

31
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:02,693
Happy Birthday

32
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,752
You're such an acclaimed scientist!

33
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,458
You are not even aware
you should give a return gift!

34
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:17,959
Gift?!

35
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,029
Return gift...?

36
00:04:20,288 --> 00:04:21,580
Which means...

37
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:23,734
...something is brewing
in your mind!

38
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:25,571
What do you want me to give?

39
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:26,929
Will you do it for me?

40
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,787
Have I ever said
'no' to you?

41
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:30,154
Tell me

42
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:31,721
Don't continue
this experiment

43
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,851
Let go of it

44
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,950
You are so deeply
involved in this research

45
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:40,850
I am so worried it will
only lead to some disaster

46
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:42,922
Priya...!

47
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:46,905
This invention of mine
is 99% most unlikely to work

48
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:51,393
But...

49
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,542
...if at all

50
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:55,640
...if at all it works-

51
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:07,010
Even if whatever you are
scared about does happen...

52
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:09,160
...I know I can fix it

53
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:15,888
Whom am I doing all this for?

54
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:17,693
For you

55
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:19,615
And for our son

56
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:25,771
What's my little prince
complaining about now?

57
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,712
He is hungry
Wants milk it seems

58
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:29,862
- Hold him for 5 minutes
- Where are you off to?

59
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:30,762
I'll be right back

60
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,140
- Priya...hey!
- I'll be back

61
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:33,172
I'm neck deep in work-

62
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:34,780
Give me just 5 minutes

63
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,143
Sweetypie

64
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:41,748
No matter what anyone says
you are your mother's pet

65
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,724
Even when we admit you in school...

66
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:46,041
...don't take your father's surname

67
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:51,248
I will make sure
you take your mother's name

68
00:05:51,414 --> 00:05:52,873
Are you okay with that?

69
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:56,531
You will lie down
here for a while

70
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,670
Lie down comfortably

71
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,823
Rest a bit

72
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:13,670
(baby crying)

73
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,851
Oh...o...o
Why...why?

74
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:19,292
Don't cry, sweetypie

75
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:20,900
Mother is coming

76
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,125
I'll ask your mother to sing for you

77
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,025
Your favourite song, okay?

78
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:28,247
(birds chirping)

79
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:31,692
(water flowing)

80
00:06:31,898 --> 00:06:33,440
1 minute...patience, dear

81
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:36,721
(baby fretting)

82
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:38,295
There you go

83
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:39,670
(baby's squeal of delight)

84
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,211
He is all smiles listening
to his amma's voice

85
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:42,403
Mamma's boy!

86
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:54,045
"Our little bundle of love
You're born to rule, sleep now"

87
00:06:54,087 --> 00:07:02,273
"Hush a bye baby
Sleep listening to this lullaby"

88
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:11,101
"Our cherished flower scented sweet
You're born to conquer, now sleep"

89
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:19,834
"Rest, my little one so dear
Sleep, my treasure trove of laughter"

90
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:28,696
"In the crystal depths of your eyes
all your sorrows will subside"

91
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:36,930
"With the wave of your hand fancy
my world functions in normalcy"

92
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:46,229
"In your every tiny heartbeat
my whole life revolves complete"

93
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:54,879
"Hush, my baby
Listen to my lullaby"

94
00:07:54,964 --> 00:08:03,539
"Our little bundle of love
You're born to rule, sleep now"

95
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:29,586
"For every person born on earth
there is a purpose to unearth"

96
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:38,627
"You are my expressive essence
You are my entire sustenance"

97
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:47,317
"My penance paid rich dividends
I am blessed with you, my little prince"

98
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:55,949
"Sleep, my pearl crescent of joy
Sweet dreams, my precious boy"

99
00:08:56,193 --> 00:09:05,110
"Sleep, my pearl crescent of joy
Sweet dreams, my precious boy"

100
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:15,899
"Hush, my baby
Listen to my lullaby"

101
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:25,006
"Our little bundle of love
You're born to rule, sleep now"

102
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:39,922
"Our little bundle of love
You're born to rule, sleep now"

103
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,820
Good afternoon, sir

104
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:42,780
Has he started?

105
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:44,469
I was with him
all morning, sir

106
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,077
He should be
done by now

107
00:09:46,244 --> 00:09:48,244
He was supposed to
start by 4:00 p.m

108
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,140
I heard sounds
from the lab

109
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:51,265
He must have started

110
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,851
Sir, I've been working
all these years for you

111
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,835
You said you would
reward me suitably

112
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,246
Priya...!

113
00:10:43,546 --> 00:10:45,588
Priya, it's working

114
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:46,738
Yes...!

115
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:49,562
I did it

116
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:51,212
My watch is working!

117
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:54,122
Priya

118
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,330
Priya?

119
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:25,588
Priya?

120
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,530
Priya

121
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:07,399
In the same womb 36 weeks
we lay beside; cheek to cheek

122
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:10,837
Within few minutes gap
we came out to our mother's lap

123
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,166
Identical in identity
Twins, you and me

124
00:12:15,494 --> 00:12:20,577
What was the difference in time
between you and me being born?

125
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,825
3 minutes

126
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,916
Just

127
00:12:26,697 --> 00:12:28,155
180 seconds

128
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:37,343
Those 180 seconds
have moulded us

129
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:40,785
Opposites of each other
180 degrees apart

130
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,833
That's time...!

131
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:47,850
Look how it has
played in our lives

132
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:53,356
Who can analyse time
better than you, right?

133
00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:54,843
Doctor

134
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:56,889
Sethuraman

135
00:12:59,968 --> 00:13:00,968
You

136
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:03,390
You are the perfect son

137
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:05,662
A celebrated scientist

138
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,008
The one who made
Phoenix Watch Company

139
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,616
...India's leading enterprise

140
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,093
Model husband
Most loving father

141
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:13,285
Etc...etc

142
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:14,439
Etcetera!

143
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,307
But I, on the other hand

144
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:19,067
I am

145
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:21,458
A brilliant villain

146
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:25,670
Happy birthday,
my dear twin brother

147
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:29,767
Where is the birthday gift
for your brother?

148
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:35,892
I have come

149
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:39,575
For my watch

150
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:42,413
Athreya, just don't hurt Priya

151
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:55,137
Happy birthday

152
00:13:55,162 --> 00:13:56,996
...to me!

153
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:00,937
Sethu

154
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:01,843
Look at me

155
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:02,593
Priya

156
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,638
Search every nook and corner

157
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:08,580
Hurry up

158
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,133
I'm sure he must have
hidden the watch here

159
00:14:11,158 --> 00:14:12,408
Where is our baby?

160
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:13,392
He is...

161
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:15,908
...in the secret room

162
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,810
Aiyo! Priya

163
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:17,710
What happened?

164
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:18,776
The watch

165
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:20,765
It is with him

166
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:26,400
- Mithra
- Sir?

167
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:29,050
It must be in some
watch case, Mithra

168
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:34,427
Please don't tell him
where the watch is

169
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,325
If he finds out where it is
he will kill our baby

170
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:54,954
(baby crying)

171
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:08,262
Silence!

172
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:14,802
Sir

173
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,366
We have looked everywhere, sir

174
00:15:17,952 --> 00:15:19,202
The watch is not here

175
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:20,393
It must be here

176
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:21,718
I heard their baby crying

177
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:23,078
I want that baby

178
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:24,895
- Go, search
- Okay, sir

179
00:15:32,856 --> 00:15:34,481
Where the hell is it?

180
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:38,301
Don't...!

181
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,148
Don't hurt her

182
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:44,806
Priya

183
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:47,381
 Athreya

184
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,531
She will suffocate

185
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:50,598
She can't breathe

186
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:52,373
Athreya, don't hurt her

187
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:53,690
You are mistaken

188
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:55,289
My experiment
is not yet done

189
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:56,689
Give me 5 minutes

190
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,711
I'll make it work
and hand it over to you

191
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:00,403
I swear, trust me

192
00:16:04,345 --> 00:16:05,512
'Priya...!'

193
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:08,002
'Priya, it's working, Priya!'

194
00:16:08,405 --> 00:16:09,530
'I did it'

195
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,936
'My watch is working!'

196
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:14,194
Think I'm deaf?

197
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Did you think I'm stone deaf?

198
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:26,132
Poor Priya!
She may die

199
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:30,119
What do you mean
'She may die'?

200
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,984
Let go

201
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,150
Please...don't kill her

202
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:37,508
I'm begging you

203
00:16:47,366 --> 00:16:48,679
Priya

204
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:35,225
Don't cry

205
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:37,931
Please don't cry

206
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:39,473
Stop!

207
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:44,876
Over there

208
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:48,021
(baby crying)

209
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:57,229
(muffled crying)

210
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,887
(Train whistling)

211
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:21,808
Hurry

212
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:28,319
You'll be fine

213
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:32,455
NO

214
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:33,627
Go

215
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:34,414
Move

216
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,564
Faaaast!

217
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,629
(baby crying)

218
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:11,944
I'm sorry, my son

219
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:25,282
(baby crying)

220
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:28,340
GO

221
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,055
Your beloved brother

222
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,601
...did not have the heart
to leave his twin all alone

223
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,691
For the last time

224
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,577
Where is the watch?

225
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:36,577
What you didn't tell me

226
00:21:36,602 --> 00:21:38,394
Your son just did!

227
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,343
You are a very lucky man

228
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:47,061
Your birth day and
the day you died

229
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,133
...are one and the same

230
00:21:50,128 --> 00:21:52,461
May you live long!

231
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,358
(gunshot)

232
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,348
Ten

233
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:20,839
Nine

234
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:22,027
Eight

235
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:22,656
Bomb?

236
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:23,556
Seven

237
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:25,243
Six

238
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,005
Five

239
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:28,965
Four

240
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:30,571
Three

241
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,342
Two

242
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:34,386
One

243
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,575
Son, so far we heard
numbers in reverse

244
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,560
Now let us listen to
letters in reverse, okay?

245
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:46,695
Z

246
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,717
Y

247
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:48,662
X

248
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,320
'26 Years later'

249
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:53,749
Maaaa?

250
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:54,691
Coming

251
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:56,257
- Hurry up
- I am coming

252
00:23:56,282 --> 00:23:57,824
I have other customers to visit

253
00:23:58,058 --> 00:23:59,558
Wait, don't hassle me

254
00:23:59,714 --> 00:24:01,522
The walls here are
covered with clocks

255
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:03,544
But completely oblivious
to the value of time

256
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:04,710
Come soon, ma

257
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,069
I have other places to go

258
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:09,219
As if people are waiting
spreading a red carpet for you!

259
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,500
What's wrong with him?

260
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:12,108
He didn't switch off the light

261
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,843
When he gets the bill
he will get enlightened!

262
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,882
Aiyo! I could have
got electrocuted

263
00:24:16,907 --> 00:24:18,711
Why hasn't he fixed
this switch as yet?

264
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:21,249
I've been telling him
like a broken record!

265
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,156
Why are you so impatient?

266
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:24,806
Can't you see I'm coming?

267
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:28,119
As if you will trade
something out of this world?

268
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:30,269
You'll throw away
your old junk

269
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:32,552
I have boxes filled
with gold and diamond

270
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:33,868
Why don't you take them?

271
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:35,253
Fat hopes!

272
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:36,778
Finished breakfast?

273
00:24:36,803 --> 00:24:37,803
Of course!

274
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,521
What is this box?

275
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:44,287
Hey! How did this get here?

276
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:45,500
Wait, let me take a look

277
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,858
What do you use this for?

278
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:49,341
I pound ginger and garlic
I hammer nails with it

279
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:51,033
Prop up our chair
with a broken leg

280
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:53,017
We even swat mosquitoes with it

281
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,516
I can't sell this

282
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,977
This box is as old as my son!

283
00:24:57,057 --> 00:24:58,393
What is inside this box?

284
00:24:58,418 --> 00:24:59,543
Who knows?

285
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:01,455
I tried opening it
for so many years

286
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,813
I have no clue
what is inside

287
00:25:02,838 --> 00:25:03,778
Just unable to prise it open

288
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,202
Give it to me
I can open it

289
00:25:05,227 --> 00:25:07,893
As if you can do what
we couldn't all these years

290
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,005
Give it here

291
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:10,432
Maaaa?

292
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:12,330
What?

293
00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:13,906
Give me the box
we use to break stuff

294
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:14,506
Heard that?

295
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:15,859
Didn't I tell you
how useful it is!

296
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:17,134
Now you know its value

297
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:19,087
He was trying to
walk away with it

298
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:20,954
Do you know its value?

299
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:22,325
Watch me now

300
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:26,641
Hey...!

301
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:29,260
Haven't I told you not
to show your face here?

302
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:31,328
Anna, it was your mother
who called me to-

303
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:33,406
Ma, you have too much
time on your hands

304
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:36,857
Thanks to this chap, you are
trading all our vessels for plastic

305
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,039
You are hell bent on
throwing away old stuff

306
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:40,914
One day you'll be
the only old stuff remaining

307
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,702
And he will trade you
for a plastic bucket!

308
00:25:42,814 --> 00:25:45,689
Mother, of late your activities
are becoming questionable

309
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:46,804
- Hey!
- Huh?

310
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:47,704
Clear off!

311
00:25:49,802 --> 00:25:50,508
Hey!

312
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:53,336
Haven't I told you not to spit
your gum all over the place?

313
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:54,786
It sticks to my slippers like glue

314
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:55,876
Go, wretched fellow!

315
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:56,825
Get out

316
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:58,742
Why did you go out
without drinking coffee?

317
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,890
- Eat breakfast
- What's for lunch?

318
00:26:01,336 --> 00:26:03,865
It's been ages since I tasted
your delicious fish curry

319
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:05,398
Okay...okay

320
00:26:05,423 --> 00:26:07,048
How shameless can you get?

321
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:10,846
Can shamelessness
satisfy hungry stomachs?

322
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:13,476
Ma, where is that
wooden prop-box?

323
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:14,595
Saravana has it

324
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:15,384
Hey!

325
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:16,248
What?

326
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:17,516
Slide it over

327
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:18,872
Here you go

328
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:19,688
Enjoy

329
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:24,586
Why are you still here?

330
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:25,278
No, anna

331
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:27,492
I was hoping I could taste
your mother's fish curry

332
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:31,559
Oh yes! I am here to cook
your favorite dishes 24x7

333
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:34,805
But do I have a daughter-in-law
to cook a single meal for me?

334
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:35,971
Did you hear me?

335
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:38,086
Loud and clear!

336
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:41,902
To tick your wish list I have
a long line of to-be brides waiting

337
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,498
Look at her, sir

338
00:26:53,523 --> 00:26:54,648
Such a beautiful girl

339
00:26:54,673 --> 00:26:56,465
But how tragic
she cannot talk

340
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:59,310
- Poor soul!
- You mean this girl?

341
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:00,468
Is this girl born dumb?

342
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,451
She opens her mouth
you can see doomsday!

343
00:27:02,476 --> 00:27:04,793
 She is the granddaughter
of that elderly gentleman

344
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:06,645
She is off to Chennai
to study agriculture

345
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,461
Why are all of them
into sign language?

346
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:12,343
They treated one of their
family members too harsh

347
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:15,469
She walked out of
the house many years ago

348
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:17,063
That was on a Friday

349
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:18,804
Repenting their rude behavior...

350
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:22,829
...and not let their tongue run
in the words they speak hereafter

351
00:27:22,922 --> 00:27:27,588
...every Friday from
6:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m

352
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,672
...they strictly follow
this vow of silence

353
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:32,989
 6'o clock

354
00:27:33,014 --> 00:27:34,306
It's 6'o clock now

355
00:27:34,454 --> 00:27:37,412
- Don't talk to strangers, dear
- Make sure your phone is charged

356
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:39,297
- Don't forget to eat well
- Call us every day

357
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:41,156
First get inside
and close the door

358
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:42,087
Bye, Sathya
Go inside

359
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:43,313
Grandpa

360
00:28:32,181 --> 00:28:34,723
(fire alarm announcement)

361
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:07,830
Mithraaaaaa!

362
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:17,372
Doctor

363
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:18,468
Is it true
what I heard?

364
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:19,827
It's a miracle, Mithran

365
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:23,454
Waking up from coma
after 26 years is a miracle

366
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:26,232
But below the waist,
he is completely paralyzed

367
00:29:26,612 --> 00:29:27,862
But what's amazing is...

368
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:29,779
...his brain function
is absolutely normal

369
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:32,589
Mithran?

370
00:29:32,723 --> 00:29:34,140
But we have a problem

371
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,165
Mithraaaa!

372
00:29:52,743 --> 00:29:54,201
Why are you staring at me?

373
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:55,842
Who are you!?

374
00:29:55,908 --> 00:29:57,575
Where is Mithran?

375
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:01,161
It's me, sir

376
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:04,698
Mithra?

377
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:06,473
What has happened to you?

378
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:14,028
I've grown old, sir

379
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:15,848
What-

380
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:18,103
Which year is this?

381
00:30:20,342 --> 00:30:22,509
2016

382
00:30:23,182 --> 00:30:24,473
Two thou-

383
00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:26,473
2016...?

384
00:30:29,073 --> 00:30:30,532
Get me a mirror

385
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:32,348
Not now, sir

386
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:33,640
You've just regain-

387
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:34,848
Mithraaaa

388
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:37,015
Didn't you hear me?

389
00:30:37,473 --> 00:30:39,140
Bring it to me

390
00:31:03,003 --> 00:31:05,765
'May you live long'

391
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:08,757
Everyone wants to
live long and enjoy life

392
00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:10,598
But no one...

393
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:13,765
...wants to live long
when they are old and grey

394
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:15,057
Look at me

395
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,147
I have aged without
having lived, Mithra

396
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,567
I cannot live
this kind of life

397
00:31:23,683 --> 00:31:28,517
Those who were scared of me
will now be oozing with self pity

398
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:34,817
I went after a machine to have
Time in the palm of my hands

399
00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:37,407
In the blink of an eye

400
00:31:37,432 --> 00:31:40,098
I have lost 26 years
of my precious life

401
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,848
I want to get back
all that I lost

402
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:46,285
Mobility, my youth, everything

403
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:49,015
Doctor

404
00:31:50,182 --> 00:31:52,515
Take him to whichever
corner of the world

405
00:31:52,817 --> 00:31:54,734
Spare no expense

406
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,598
But cure him

407
00:31:56,723 --> 00:31:59,015
I've been treating him
for 16 years till date

408
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:01,557
If I could do so, wouldn't
I have told you by now?

409
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,848
I don't want excuses

410
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:04,432
Give me a solution

411
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:06,432
I want the cure

412
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,307
There's only one way I know

413
00:32:08,348 --> 00:32:10,140
Go back in time
26 years ago

414
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:13,057
Prevent him from being
involved in that accident

415
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,557
In other words, it's impossible

416
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:18,598
Sir

417
00:32:18,682 --> 00:32:20,140
Don't worry about anything

418
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:21,348
Mithra

419
00:32:22,557 --> 00:32:25,057
Did you listen carefully
to what the doctor said?

420
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:32,098
He doesn't know it is possible
to go back 26 years in time

421
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:35,570
But you and I know

422
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,166
Where is that watch?

423
00:32:41,697 --> 00:32:46,030
'The house and lab
are still in my custody'

424
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,187
- Mithra
- Sir?

425
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:29,240
'Good afternoon'

426
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:31,627
'The time now is 4:42 p.m'

427
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:33,183
'I am Dr Sethuraman'

428
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:35,846
'One among the many prestigious
watch manufacturing companies in India'

429
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:38,026
'...is our Phoenix Watch Company'

430
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,515
'We have manufactured
different kinds of watches'

431
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:43,557
'Now at a very basic level'

432
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:45,057
'What is a watch?'

433
00:33:46,237 --> 00:33:47,723
'A device that shows the time'

434
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:48,737
'That is all'

435
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:50,015
'And as you all know...'

436
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:52,723
'...time cannot be
controlled by mankind'

437
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:56,223
'But what if we are
able to control it?'

438
00:33:58,601 --> 00:33:59,601
'Project'

439
00:33:59,682 --> 00:34:00,723
'24'

440
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:15,487
'Priya'

441
00:34:15,674 --> 00:34:17,098
'Is this a playground?'

442
00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:20,557
'How many times have I told you
not to bring the baby here?'

443
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:22,074
Mithra

444
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,892
Make this lab
the way it used to be!

445
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:31,546
We can use this manual and
create the watch ourselves

446
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,557
Right...let's go

447
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:25,307
Hear me out

448
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,916
Youngsters nowadays
just can't wait to get married

449
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:31,390
The son I gave birth to
shows total disinterest

450
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:32,765
Boys! Auto is here

451
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:34,848
Sort all the items
and weigh them

452
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:35,765
On your toes

453
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:37,265
You were saying something

454
00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:39,057
What more can I say?

455
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:41,432
How much longer
will I talk to myself?

456
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,182
Why?

457
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,140
Don't I need a daughter-in-law
at least to fight with at home?

458
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:48,057
I've spread the word in my circles
for a good match for your son

459
00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:48,848
Okay

460
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,473
A lovely daughter-in-law will
soon land up at our doorstep

461
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,723
Let me tell you
what I feel

462
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:56,098
Mani's time has come

463
00:35:56,337 --> 00:35:58,598
Everything will work
like well oiled clockwork

464
00:35:58,751 --> 00:36:01,640
Every time I talk to you
I feel calm and rejuvenated

465
00:36:01,682 --> 00:36:02,384
I'm glad

466
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:04,515
The right girl for my son

467
00:36:04,557 --> 00:36:05,515
You are in charge

468
00:36:05,557 --> 00:36:06,265
That's it

469
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:08,015
Don't even worry about it

470
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:10,103
A wonderful girl will find
her way into your home!

471
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,244
Be strong

472
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:22,603
Mani

473
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:24,188
Mani, where are you?

474
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,865
Saravana...?

475
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:26,890
I'm coming...coming

476
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:27,682
What is this?

477
00:36:27,723 --> 00:36:29,598
Why do you leave
the shop unattended?

478
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,978
I was here all this while
I went to attend to my customer

479
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:32,820
Where's Mani?

480
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:35,640
Only 1/2 an hour ago he said
he would be back in 5 minutes

481
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:37,265
He should be here
in another hour

482
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:38,890
Someone will loot us threadbare

483
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:40,723
Only then you will learn a lesson

484
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:44,682
Hey! How long since I asked you to get
an electrician to repair that switch?

485
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:45,515
I'll attend to it

486
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:48,598
I'm get electrocuted and then
it will be too late to regret

487
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:52,830
What is this unique key?

488
00:36:53,557 --> 00:36:55,848
Wonder which lock it fits!

489
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,337
Nair

490
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:10,767
Hello, Nair

491
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:12,110
Your wall clock is ready

492
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,182
I told Saravana to give it to you

493
00:37:13,223 --> 00:37:15,640
He gave me the clock
But he forgot the winding key

494
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:16,723
Typical!
Silly fool

495
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:17,682
Just a minute

496
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:19,265
It must be here somewhere

497
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:21,220
Where can it be?

498
00:37:24,472 --> 00:37:25,376
Whose key is-

499
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:26,446
Mani, my key

500
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:28,167
Here it is

501
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:29,166
Sorry, Nair

502
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:29,845
I made you come back

503
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,286
I gave the money
to Saravana

504
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:19,958
Oh! Look at that!

505
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:21,191
A watch

506
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:23,789
No wonder

507
00:38:23,814 --> 00:38:26,564
What will you expect to find
in a watch mechanic's shop?

508
00:38:26,993 --> 00:38:29,682
So the mystery of the prop-box
has been solved despite the build up!

509
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:31,924
It never even struck me

510
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,319
Looks quite new

511
00:38:35,556 --> 00:38:36,930
Project

512
00:38:36,955 --> 00:38:38,121
24...?

513
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:42,264
That's strange!

514
00:38:43,097 --> 00:38:44,431
24-hours dial

515
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:46,617
'Mani!...?'

516
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:47,182
Hahn

517
00:38:47,223 --> 00:38:48,390
'Are you back?'

518
00:38:48,712 --> 00:38:49,890
I'm back, ma

519
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:52,640
'How many days I've been
asking you to change that switch?'

520
00:38:52,682 --> 00:38:54,140
'Do you intend to or not?'

521
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:55,313
Shock-

522
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:56,240
It isn't a big deal, ma

523
00:38:56,265 --> 00:38:57,348
I'll look into it

524
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:00,157
My dear mother

525
00:39:00,269 --> 00:39:01,306
I managed to open that bo-

526
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:14,774
'Hey! Mani'

527
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,973
'I heard a loud crash
What happened?'

528
00:39:17,015 --> 00:39:18,015
Nothing, ma

529
00:39:18,098 --> 00:39:19,390
Nothing

530
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:12,952
Hey! Mani

531
00:40:13,688 --> 00:40:14,848
Where did you disappear?

532
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,532
You said you'll be
back in 5 minutes

533
00:40:16,696 --> 00:40:17,682
Your mother yelled at me

534
00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:18,390
Okay, listen

535
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,728
Khader from the tyre shop
collected his watch

536
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:21,772
He paid Rs 150

537
00:40:22,017 --> 00:40:23,499
 Nair from the tea shop

538
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:24,634
I gave him his wall clock

539
00:40:24,765 --> 00:40:26,056
You forgot the winding key...?

540
00:40:26,212 --> 00:40:27,218
That doesn't matter

541
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:27,973
He paid Rs 250

542
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:28,821
Then...listen

543
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,598
Remember that ugly green
ladies' watch you had?

544
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:33,595
A soooper glam-doll walked in

545
00:40:33,946 --> 00:40:34,821
 I palmed it off onto her

546
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:36,307
I gave her a 10% discount

547
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:37,973
- 10 %?
- Doesn't matter

548
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:39,598
Rs 800 for that watch

549
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:41,890
All this adds
up to Rs 1200

550
00:40:42,415 --> 00:40:44,415
For all my effort put into this

551
00:40:44,618 --> 00:40:45,923
I'll just help myself to Rs 100

552
00:40:46,165 --> 00:40:46,735
Hey!

553
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:47,610
100 bucks

554
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:48,759
100 is too much for you

555
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:49,723
I'll tell my mother

556
00:40:49,765 --> 00:40:51,182
Better not step in here

557
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,468
'Hey! Mani'

558
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:34,120
'I heard a loud crash
What happened?'

559
00:41:35,886 --> 00:41:36,626
'Hey!'

560
00:41:36,651 --> 00:41:38,443
'Can you hear me or not?'

561
00:41:38,657 --> 00:41:39,843
'I heard a loud noise'

562
00:41:39,868 --> 00:41:40,993
'Nothing'

563
00:41:41,018 --> 00:41:42,185
'Nothing, ma'

564
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,329
'It took you so long
to say this, huh?'

565
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:11,078
'Where did you disappear?'

566
00:42:11,103 --> 00:42:12,548
'You said you'll be
back in 5 minutes'

567
00:42:12,673 --> 00:42:13,598
'Your mother yelled at me'

568
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:14,387
'Okay, listen'

569
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:16,845
'Khader from the tyre shop
collected his watch'

570
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:17,899
'He paid Rs 150'

571
00:42:18,017 --> 00:42:19,298
'Nair from the tea shop'

572
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:20,696
'I gave him his wall clock'

573
00:42:20,884 --> 00:42:21,890
'He paid Rs 250'

574
00:42:22,587 --> 00:42:23,657
'Then...listen'

575
00:42:23,682 --> 00:42:26,165
'Remember that ugly green
ladies' watch you had?'

576
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:28,736
'A soooper glam-doll walked in'

577
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:29,717
'I palmed it off onto her'

578
00:42:29,742 --> 00:42:31,325
'I gave her a 10% discount'

579
00:42:31,662 --> 00:42:32,977
'Rs 800 for that watch'

580
00:42:33,002 --> 00:42:34,959
'All this adds
up to Rs 1200'

581
00:42:35,037 --> 00:42:37,107
'For all my effort put into this'

582
00:42:37,232 --> 00:42:38,456
'I'll just help myself to Rs 100'

583
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:39,273
See you

584
00:42:39,298 --> 00:42:40,923
Keep your watches clean

585
00:42:55,183 --> 00:42:57,225
'Stay right there
I'll be back'

586
00:43:40,975 --> 00:43:42,308
'Hey! Mani'

587
00:43:42,392 --> 00:43:45,058
'I heard a loud crash
What happened?'

588
00:43:45,517 --> 00:43:47,392
My respected mother!

589
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,558
Nothing at all, mathaji

590
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:57,392
'Hey! Mani'

591
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,850
'Where did you disappear?'

592
00:43:58,892 --> 00:44:00,642
'You said you'll be
back in 5 minutes'

593
00:44:00,683 --> 00:44:01,933
'Your mother yelled at me'

594
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:02,683
'Okay, list-'

595
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:03,850
Shut up

596
00:44:04,566 --> 00:44:06,058
Did Khader from
the tyre shop come?

597
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,725
Yes

598
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:08,277
- Did you give him his watch?
- Yes

599
00:44:08,302 --> 00:44:09,343
You took Rs 150?

600
00:44:09,553 --> 00:44:10,303
Yes

601
00:44:10,376 --> 00:44:12,667
Count...count and
keep it on my table

602
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:15,308
Did Nair from
the tea shop come?

603
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,333
- Gave him the wall clock?
- Yes

604
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:19,100
Forgot the winding key, right?

605
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:19,892
Yes

606
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:21,225
Took 250 from him, eh?

607
00:44:21,267 --> 00:44:21,892
Yes

608
00:44:21,933 --> 00:44:23,142
Keep it on the table

609
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,558
Remember that ugly green
ladies' watch in the showcase?

610
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,558
Yes

611
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:30,600
Did a soooper
glam-doll walk in?

612
00:44:30,642 --> 00:44:31,433
Yes

613
00:44:31,475 --> 00:44:32,933
She flashed her close-up smile?

614
00:44:32,975 --> 00:44:33,683
Yes

615
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:35,642
Did you give her
a 10% discount?

616
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:38,433
Bloody idiot! You sold
that watch for Rs 800?

617
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:39,081
Yes

618
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:40,731
Keep that 800 on the table

619
00:44:43,142 --> 00:44:45,308
Now claiming you put in
so much effort...

620
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,142
...you'll take a kickback from me?

621
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:48,058
Am I right?

622
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,600
Hogger of the first order!

623
00:44:49,642 --> 00:44:50,808
Help yourself and go

624
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,767
How did you get it
picture perfect right?

625
00:44:52,808 --> 00:44:53,933
Off you go, man

626
00:44:54,017 --> 00:44:55,767
Go and attend to your work

627
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:56,683
Mani

628
00:44:56,725 --> 00:44:58,392
Hey! Just get out I say

629
00:44:58,417 --> 00:44:59,584
I'm leaving right now

630
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:19,225
'Stay right there
I'll be back'

631
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,083
Hello!

632
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:20,774
Yes?

633
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:22,174
Watch your step

634
00:45:22,841 --> 00:45:24,299
Sorry, sir
Thank you!

635
00:45:24,642 --> 00:45:27,475
'Instead of looking ahead
I kept turning back'

636
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:33,850
'Instead of looking ahead
I kept turning back'

637
00:45:37,142 --> 00:45:38,475
I kept turning back-

638
00:45:39,896 --> 00:45:41,563
Instead of looking ahead

639
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:09,017
Oh gawd!

640
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:09,933
Damn

641
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,767
What a sudden downpour

642
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:15,100
All the clothes I washed
will be dripping wet now

643
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:17,350
When you want rain
it will be so stubborn!

644
00:46:17,392 --> 00:46:20,058
And when you don't want rain
it will have a mind of its own!

645
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,225
All my hard work
is down the drain

646
00:46:22,767 --> 00:46:23,517
Sir

647
00:46:23,558 --> 00:46:24,642
Sir...sir

648
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:25,475
1 minute

649
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:28,350
Could you tell me
the time in your watch?

650
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:33,021
10:30

651
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,683
'Come at 5'o clock, sharp'

652
00:46:53,558 --> 00:46:55,792
What are you doing?
My shirt is getting drenched

653
00:46:55,837 --> 00:46:57,878
Water the plants
Not me, imbecile

654
00:46:58,017 --> 00:46:59,100
'Mani'

655
00:47:00,427 --> 00:47:02,677
'I'll just step out
for a while, son'

656
00:47:04,128 --> 00:47:06,386
A groom is coming over to see
Kamakshi's daughter Sudha

657
00:47:06,411 --> 00:47:07,745
I'll be back in half an hour

658
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,005
Don't leave the shop
unattended till then

659
00:47:10,298 --> 00:47:11,488
Alright, take this with you

660
00:47:11,513 --> 00:47:12,513
What is this for?

661
00:47:12,651 --> 00:47:13,860
What if it rains today?

662
00:47:14,058 --> 00:47:16,100
April sun shining bright

663
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:17,392
How will it rain today?

664
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:20,058
No April showers, just take it
to protect yourself from the sun

665
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,642
I've gone out
in the sun so often

666
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:23,642
Why this sudden spurt
of care and concern?

667
00:47:23,725 --> 00:47:24,433
Mathaji!

668
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:26,933
Catastrophes, apostrophes
with bed coffee and atrocities

669
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,058
You are oblivious to!

670
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,683
Listen to your
one and only son

671
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:31,100
Take the umbrella with you

672
00:47:31,142 --> 00:47:33,725
I'm already worried about
finding the perfect match for you

673
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,433
You're blabbering
more than usual!

674
00:47:35,475 --> 00:47:37,392
Looks like my little faith
will also disappear

675
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:38,392
Why are you like this?

676
00:47:38,433 --> 00:47:39,392
Take it with you

677
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:41,017
You take care of yourself, son

678
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:41,933
Bye

679
00:47:43,064 --> 00:47:44,191
Don't leave the umbrella behind

680
00:47:44,216 --> 00:47:45,216
Okay...okay

681
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,863
Freeze

682
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:20,404
"Hail!"

683
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:22,311
"The most proficient"

684
00:49:23,207 --> 00:49:24,313
"Monarch omnipotent"

685
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:25,859
"Attend"

686
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:27,647
"Hey!"

687
00:49:28,728 --> 00:49:29,890
"The ever talented"

688
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:31,654
"King resplendent"

689
00:49:32,442 --> 00:49:33,394
"Descend"

690
00:49:34,988 --> 00:49:35,988
"No illusory power"

691
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:37,839
"No magic spell either"

692
00:49:38,683 --> 00:49:39,683
"Not any sorcery"

693
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:41,566
"Nor wizardry"

694
00:49:42,395 --> 00:49:43,394
"This isn’t maya"

695
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,214
"Nor abracadabra"

696
00:49:46,074 --> 00:49:47,074
"No voodoo or hoodoo"

697
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:48,981
"No mumbo-jumbo"

698
00:49:49,238 --> 00:49:55,160
"Has Time become my lady love?
An enchantress from above"

699
00:49:56,658 --> 00:50:02,923
"Is Time the enlightened visionary
who changed Einstein’s theory?"

700
00:50:20,632 --> 00:50:27,662
"I circled the celestial spheres
On my finger tips twirls success"

701
00:50:28,055 --> 00:50:34,769
"My life holds no fear
My heart has a four-leaf clover"

702
00:50:35,246 --> 00:50:42,620
"The key unlocked the box by fluke
Opened a new vista in my hands, look!"

703
00:50:42,847 --> 00:50:46,472
"Shall I tell you how to defeat death?"

704
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:50,164
"I’m God’s favorite child on earth"

705
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:56,414
"Has Time become my lady love?
An enchantress from above"

706
00:51:19,782 --> 00:51:23,219
"In the arms of Time cradled
even I become a child"

707
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:26,914
"Holding my beloved’s hand clasped
we travel both to our future and past"

708
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:30,555
"The moon and sun will be my toys"

709
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:34,273
"A whole world’s lifetime
I’ll live in 24 hours sublime"

710
00:51:34,289 --> 00:51:40,367
"Welcome, the lucky one"

711
00:51:41,023 --> 00:51:44,655
"The enchanting magician"

712
00:51:44,711 --> 00:51:48,375
"The lucky mascot"

713
00:51:48,414 --> 00:51:52,757
"Forever rising to the top"

714
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:55,968
"The omnipresent one, come"

715
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,077
"The resplendent one, welcome"

716
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:07,483
"The one who showers intelligence
The savior from heaven, descend"

717
00:52:07,546 --> 00:52:14,272
"The praiseworthy one, materialize
The messenger of change, rise"

718
00:52:15,163 --> 00:52:22,241
"The salt of earth, welcome
The diviner of change, come"

719
00:52:22,968 --> 00:52:24,874
"No illusory power"

720
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:26,669
"No magic spell either"

721
00:52:26,693 --> 00:52:28,529
"Not any sorcery"

722
00:52:28,584 --> 00:52:29,584
"Nor wizardry"

723
00:52:30,396 --> 00:52:32,263
"This isn’t maya"

724
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,052
"Nor abracadabra"

725
00:52:34,115 --> 00:52:35,904
"No voodoo or hoodoo"

726
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:37,247
"No mumbo-jumbo"

727
00:52:37,263 --> 00:52:43,700
"Has Time become my lady love?
An enchantress from above"

728
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:50,740
"Is Time the enlightened visionary
who changed Einstein’s theory?"

729
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:54,141
"Is Time my beloved addictive?"

730
00:52:55,732 --> 00:52:58,083
"A damsel ever so exclusive?"

731
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:15,925
Move aside

732
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:17,633
Blocking my way

733
00:53:17,717 --> 00:53:19,383
Are you blind or what?

734
00:53:20,008 --> 00:53:22,258
'Why did you come this early?'

735
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:30,967
Excuse me

736
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:33,092
My watch is broken
I need to fix it fast

737
00:53:33,175 --> 00:53:35,217
- When will that shop open?

Customer is waiting

00:53:38,383 --> 00:53:39,967
Please wait for 2 minutes

741
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,342
Mani, can you hear me?

742
00:53:41,383 --> 00:53:42,383
Hurry up

743
00:53:57,008 --> 00:53:58,258
Help me down

744
00:53:58,342 --> 00:53:59,383
Lower me

745
00:53:59,425 --> 00:54:00,050
Sorry

746
00:54:00,092 --> 00:54:01,133
Sorry...sorry

747
00:54:06,925 --> 00:54:08,300
Let me down

748
00:54:08,342 --> 00:54:09,342
Careful

749
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:21,842
My feet are on the ground

750
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,467
Take your hands off!

751
00:54:24,008 --> 00:54:26,050
Won't you be careful
while opening the shutter?

752
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:27,633
Someone maybe standing out

753
00:54:27,675 --> 00:54:28,842
No concern at all?

754
00:54:28,925 --> 00:54:30,425
What if something happens?

755
00:54:31,092 --> 00:54:32,217
Are you okay?

756
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,842
Are you hurt?

757
00:54:33,883 --> 00:54:34,967
Hope not

758
00:54:35,008 --> 00:54:35,967
Thankfully no

759
00:54:36,008 --> 00:54:37,508
But what if I had been hurt?

760
00:54:45,425 --> 00:54:46,633
Oh! No

761
00:54:49,258 --> 00:54:50,217
AIYAIYO!

762
00:54:50,258 --> 00:54:51,758
What happened?

763
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:52,550
What's wrong?

764
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:53,508
'What's wrong?'

765
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,425
Look at this!

766
00:54:54,467 --> 00:54:55,258
What?

767
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,842
My watch broke

768
00:54:57,092 --> 00:54:58,133
You broke it

769
00:54:58,175 --> 00:54:59,258
It's just a watch

770
00:54:59,342 --> 00:55:01,050
I can easily fix it for you

771
00:55:01,092 --> 00:55:03,342
I won't pay a single rupee!
Because you broke it

772
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,217
You don't have to pay
I'll fix it for you

773
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:06,592
Please enter the dragon!

774
00:55:06,675 --> 00:55:07,592
Don't forget

775
00:55:07,633 --> 00:55:09,258
I won't even pay you
a single rupee!

776
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,883
Okay, okay point noted

777
00:55:10,925 --> 00:55:11,800
Let me repeat

778
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:13,258
I won't give you
a single rupee!

779
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,675
You don't have to
pay me at all

780
00:55:14,717 --> 00:55:16,092
Give me the watch

781
00:55:17,592 --> 00:55:18,758
Wow!

782
00:55:19,175 --> 00:55:20,675
HMT watch!

783
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,092
Model S 76

784
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:25,592
This is a rare collector's item

785
00:55:25,675 --> 00:55:26,467
Of course

786
00:55:26,508 --> 00:55:28,383
This is my grandfather's gift to me

787
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,800
It's his favorite, you know

788
00:55:29,883 --> 00:55:31,467
He won't part with it to anyone

789
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:32,633
I am his granddaughter

790
00:55:32,675 --> 00:55:35,467
When I moved here to study
he gave it to me with all his love

791
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:38,592
Without a wee bit of compassion
you broke such a sentimental watch

792
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:40,550
He gave it to me
with so much love

793
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:41,800
Favorite watch

794
00:55:41,842 --> 00:55:42,967
Now I can't even use it

795
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:43,883
Listen

796
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:46,008
Your grandpa's watch
will be as good as new

797
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,425
I'm a watch mechanic

798
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:49,675
This is child's play for me

799
00:55:49,717 --> 00:55:51,842
Keep chatting
I'll get it done in a jiffy

800
00:55:51,883 --> 00:55:54,175
Right in front of your eyes,
I'll take out my tool kit

801
00:55:54,258 --> 00:55:56,592
And watch what I do to
your grandpa's watch!

802
00:56:15,842 --> 00:56:16,925
'Excuse me'

803
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:19,133
'My watch is broken
I need to fix it fast'

804
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,342
'- When will that shop open?
- Anytime now'

805
00:56:21,383 --> 00:56:22,425
 Bloody criminal!

806
00:56:22,508 --> 00:56:24,925
'Hey Mani, customer is
waiting, open your shop'

807
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:26,383
'Please wait for 2 minutes'

808
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,800
Just wait by the side here
He'll come down now

809
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:31,675
(loud thud)

810
00:56:31,717 --> 00:56:32,925
Aiyo!

811
00:56:33,008 --> 00:56:34,508
Please wait right there

812
00:56:34,967 --> 00:56:36,342
 2 steps back

813
00:56:36,383 --> 00:56:38,258
Can't even enjoy
my bun in peace!

814
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,967
What sort of life is this?

815
00:57:05,524 --> 00:57:06,507
Shucks!

816
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:07,883
Hey! Stinko

817
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,300
Where is that glam-doll?

818
00:57:09,383 --> 00:57:10,842
The one who was just-

819
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,258
Blabbermouth!

820
00:57:17,258 --> 00:57:20,300
That HMT watch, model S76
with the broken glass

821
00:57:20,342 --> 00:57:22,342
Aren't you here to
ask me to fix the glass?

822
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:23,967
How do you know
my watch broke?

823
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:25,508
And I am here
to get it fixed?

824
00:57:25,683 --> 00:57:26,925
I'm a watch mechanic, madam

825
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:28,550
These are very trivial things for me

826
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:31,508
I can hear it if any watch breaks
anywhere in this area Yeah!

827
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,383
Please come!

828
00:57:32,425 --> 00:57:33,883

Come in!

832
00:57:37,675 --> 00:57:39,300
Carry on, carry on

833
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:44,092
Watch, please

834
00:57:45,175 --> 00:57:46,175
Thanks

835
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:48,133
What?

836
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,258
Oh I see!

837
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,008
Oh ok!

838
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,008
Is it?

839
00:57:52,008 --> 00:57:53,050
Really now!

840
00:57:53,092 --> 00:57:55,925
Apparently, this watch has a
lot of sentimental value!

841
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,300
Yes! But how did you know?

842
00:57:57,342 --> 00:57:58,675
I'm a watch mechanic, madam!

843
00:57:58,717 --> 00:58:01,008
'This is child's play for me'

844
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:03,883
This is your grandfather's
favorite watch

845
00:58:03,925 --> 00:58:05,592
Yes, it is

846
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:07,592
He has never parted
with it to anyone

847
00:58:07,675 --> 00:58:09,717
When you moved here to study,...

848
00:58:09,758 --> 00:58:12,342
...he gave it to you
with so much love

849
00:58:12,383 --> 00:58:13,342
Am I right?

850
00:58:13,383 --> 00:58:15,092
Yes, but how do you know that?

851
00:58:15,133 --> 00:58:16,717
I'm a watch mechanic, madam

852
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,217
All this is child's play to me
As simple as a guppy!

853
00:58:19,258 --> 00:58:22,175
Generally speaking, I have a high
general knowledge quotient!

854
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:25,550
The watch isn't too damaged

855
00:58:25,592 --> 00:58:27,258
Only the glass needs changing

856
00:58:27,342 --> 00:58:31,342
If we could meet at around 2:00 p.m
the watch should be ready by then

857
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:32,383
(phone ringing)

858
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,258
2:00 p.m sharp

859
00:58:37,633 --> 00:58:38,633
Yes, ma?

860
00:58:40,092 --> 00:58:41,633
Why are you so quiet?

861
00:58:42,717 --> 00:58:44,633
Oh! Today's Friday?

862
00:58:45,675 --> 00:58:47,383
Are you angry with me?

863
00:58:48,383 --> 00:58:50,758
Cough twice
if you're mad at me

864
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:55,383
Have I forgotten something?

865
00:58:55,592 --> 00:58:56,675
Oh God!

866
00:58:56,758 --> 00:58:58,300
Grandpa's birthday

867
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:01,050
Is he next to you?

868
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:04,133
Sorry

869
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:06,258
Happy birthday

870
00:59:06,592 --> 00:59:08,217
Forgive my 'ghajini' memory!

871
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:10,175
Aren't you my most
precious grandpa!

872
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:12,467
Cough twice
if you've forgiven me

873
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:13,383
Good

874
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,008
I'll call at 6:01 sharp
this evening

875
00:59:15,092 --> 00:59:16,383
You had better pick up

876
00:59:16,425 --> 00:59:18,050
Happy happy birthday

877
00:59:19,342 --> 00:59:20,467
What happened?

878
00:59:20,508 --> 00:59:21,342
All okay?

879
00:59:21,383 --> 00:59:22,800
My grandpa's birthday

880
00:59:22,842 --> 00:59:24,133
I clean forgot

881
00:59:24,217 --> 00:59:25,800
I didn't look at the date

882
00:59:25,967 --> 00:59:27,300
When will the watch be ready?

883
00:59:27,342 --> 00:59:29,633
I told you, at 2:00 p.m sharp
Ready with a new glass

884
00:59:29,675 --> 00:59:31,717
At 4:00 p.m I need to go
some place important

885
00:59:31,758 --> 00:59:33,717
Will it be ready
at 2:00 p.m sharp?

886
00:59:33,758 --> 00:59:35,842
You won't send someone
to collect it, will you?

887
00:59:35,925 --> 00:59:37,050
You will come, right?

888
00:59:37,092 --> 00:59:38,383
Yes, I'll be here at 2:00

889
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:39,592
Thank you so much

890
01:00:26,217 --> 01:00:27,467
Sir, careful

891
01:00:44,763 --> 01:00:47,888
Sir, let our researchers
continue at their own pace

892
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,226
I have an idea

893
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:56,901
Best Design

894
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,385
New Talent

895
01:00:58,912 --> 01:01:00,203
Rolex

896
01:01:00,495 --> 01:01:01,537
Fancy dress?

897
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,287
Doesn't matter
I can add this too

898
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,036
Neat

899
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,039
Hi, please come
I was waiting for you

900
01:01:10,104 --> 01:01:11,124
Are you going out?

901
01:01:11,149 --> 01:01:11,899
Why?

902
01:01:12,015 --> 01:01:12,640
No

903
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:15,249
You've changed your dress
That's why I wondered

904
01:01:15,515 --> 01:01:16,345
Oh! You noticed

905
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:17,476
And you said you were waiting

906
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:20,084
I'm a watch mechanic
All this is child's play-

907
01:01:20,354 --> 01:01:21,854
Please, sit down

908
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:24,662
It's so dusty

909
01:01:24,703 --> 01:01:26,328
Lot of things on the table

910
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:29,679
So many awards!

911
01:01:29,704 --> 01:01:30,664
Are they all yours?

912
01:01:30,785 --> 01:01:32,327
 I'm a watch mechanic, right?

913
01:01:32,352 --> 01:01:34,477
These things are
run of the mill stuff

914
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:36,099
- Excuse me?
- Yeah!

915
01:01:36,182 --> 01:01:37,421
I'm in a little bit
rushed for time

916
01:01:37,446 --> 01:01:38,780
Is the watch ready?

917
01:01:38,955 --> 01:01:39,955
How much is it?

918
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,022
You don't have to pay

919
01:01:41,047 --> 01:01:41,922
Minor repair

920
01:01:41,947 --> 01:01:43,765
That isn't fair
Just tell me how much!

921
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:44,361
No-

922
01:01:44,727 --> 01:01:46,102
Okay, if you insist

923
01:01:46,255 --> 01:01:47,213
Let me bill it

924
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:49,278
What is your good name?

925
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:50,193
What?

926
01:01:50,218 --> 01:01:50,942
I need

927
01:01:50,967 --> 01:01:52,900
I need your name
for my bill

928
01:01:52,925 --> 01:01:53,966
Your name?

929
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,213
Sathya

930
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:56,906
Sathya?

931
01:01:57,846 --> 01:01:59,388
Such a sweet name

932
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:02,257
Okay, your mobile number?

933
01:02:02,365 --> 01:02:03,365
What for?

934
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,335
No, casually, for my
general knowledge

935
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,367
In case of emergency,
for customer care

936
01:02:07,392 --> 01:02:09,934
Can you tell me how much?
I really have to go now

937
01:02:13,507 --> 01:02:14,923
Two hundred and...

938
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:16,281
...forty seven rupees

939
01:02:18,732 --> 01:02:20,976
I would appreciate
if you gave me exact cash

940
01:02:56,978 --> 01:02:57,811
Hello

941
01:02:57,836 --> 01:02:58,919
Hello!

942
01:02:59,373 --> 01:03:00,873
What the hell are you doing?

943
01:03:01,078 --> 01:03:02,162
Aiyo!

944
01:03:03,662 --> 01:03:05,287
Just casually-

945
01:03:05,312 --> 01:03:06,771
Casual about what?

946
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:09,218
What the hell is so casual
about ripping my tyre apart?

947
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:10,952
It is normal for
watch mechanics to-

948
01:03:11,444 --> 01:03:12,778
What are you blabbering?

949
01:03:17,174 --> 01:03:19,382
'I would appreciate
if you gave me exact cash'

950
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,772
What happened to you?

951
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,070
Watch mechanic, ma'am

952
01:03:45,095 --> 01:03:46,636
This is child's play for me!

953
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:48,390
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

954
01:03:48,415 --> 01:03:50,290
This is just breathing exercise

955
01:03:51,263 --> 01:03:52,513
Your watch

956
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,705
Exact cash

957
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:55,754
Thanks

958
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:56,956
1 second

959
01:03:59,755 --> 01:04:00,963
Your watch

960
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:06,167
This isn't my watch

961
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:07,648
My watch doesn't show the date

962
01:04:07,673 --> 01:04:09,965
No...no
This is your watch

963
01:04:11,426 --> 01:04:13,862
This morning when you were
speaking to your grandpa...

964
01:04:13,887 --> 01:04:15,586
...you said you forgot
it was his birthday

965
01:04:15,611 --> 01:04:18,278
So I took the liberty of
adding the date for you

966
01:04:18,624 --> 01:04:19,875
I thought you would
find it useful

967
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:20,983
Hope you like it

968
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,357
Thanks a ton

969
01:04:22,436 --> 01:04:23,478
It's okay

970
01:04:23,646 --> 01:04:24,820
I'm a watch mechanic

971
01:04:24,935 --> 01:04:26,685
All this is child's play for me

972
01:04:26,757 --> 01:04:27,882
Okay, thanks

973
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:28,593
Okay

974
01:04:28,618 --> 01:04:29,368
Bye

975
01:04:33,281 --> 01:04:34,047
Oh God!

976
01:04:34,072 --> 01:04:35,947
Why...what happened?

977
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,180
I have a flat tyre

978
01:04:37,548 --> 01:04:39,214
It was fine when I got here

979
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,175
This is a very dirty,
polluted area

980
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,950
When I say chlorophyll and haemoglobin in
the air is high no one takes me seriously

981
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:49,010
This looks like someone
took a green screwdriver

982
01:04:49,035 --> 01:04:51,488
And purposely ripped
your tyre apart

983
01:04:51,569 --> 01:04:54,320
Why are the insurance agents
and environmentalists nonfunctional?

984
01:04:54,345 --> 01:04:55,970
But how do you know all this?

985
01:04:56,078 --> 01:04:56,953
Generally-

986
01:04:57,167 --> 01:04:58,334
Didn't I tell you?

987
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:00,827
'Generally speaking, I have a high
general knowledge quotient!'

988
01:05:00,852 --> 01:05:02,977
You don't worry
I'll drop you in my bike

989
01:05:03,283 --> 01:05:04,033
No, it's okay

990
01:05:04,058 --> 01:05:05,058
I'll take a 3 wheeler

991
01:05:05,148 --> 01:05:07,273
After all the trouble I took
to puncture your tyre!

992
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,803
I meant your tyre is flat
And how troublesome!

993
01:05:09,828 --> 01:05:12,620
It happened outside my shop
I'll feel better only if I drop you

994
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:14,512
Why should you
go out of your way?

995
01:05:14,537 --> 01:05:16,643
I wouldn't have it
any other way!

996
01:05:16,668 --> 01:05:18,338
This is no big deal
I can drop you

997
01:05:18,363 --> 01:05:19,238
Yeah?

998
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:21,182
How do I tell you this?

999
01:05:21,207 --> 01:05:22,393
What's the problem?

1000
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,148
I need to attend
an important event

1001
01:05:24,173 --> 01:05:25,690
That's why I borrowed
my friend's scooty

1002
01:05:25,715 --> 01:05:28,423
I brought a change of dress
with me to change at the hostel

1003
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:30,955
- But it's late now
- My mother is at home

1004
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:33,517
We live just upstairs
You can change there

1005
01:05:33,751 --> 01:05:34,819
Treat my home as yours

1006
01:05:34,844 --> 01:05:36,552
- Come in
- Thank you so much

1007
01:05:38,757 --> 01:05:39,591
Please come

1008
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:40,690
Like your own house

1009
01:05:40,715 --> 01:05:41,340
Thanks

1010
01:05:41,365 --> 01:05:43,407
'She stepped in with
her best foot forward!'

1011
01:05:56,401 --> 01:05:57,228
Yes, please come

1012
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:58,353
Ma...?

1013
01:05:59,447 --> 01:06:00,234
- Ma...ma
- What?

1014
01:06:00,259 --> 01:06:02,016
A customer needs to
change her dress here

1015
01:06:02,113 --> 01:06:03,779
Are you running
a garment store?

1016
01:06:04,254 --> 01:06:05,080
To change clothes here?

1017
01:06:05,105 --> 01:06:06,980
Can't a watch mechanic
do even this favor?

1018
01:06:07,049 --> 01:06:09,249
- What's wrong with you?
- She has a function to attend

1019
01:06:09,274 --> 01:06:11,441
One lady helping another
I told her you are here

1020
01:06:11,912 --> 01:06:13,523
Please come
She's here already

1021
01:06:13,548 --> 01:06:14,506
This is my mathaji

1022
01:06:14,812 --> 01:06:15,617
I mean, my mother

1023
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:16,669
What's your name, child?

1024
01:06:16,694 --> 01:06:17,694
Sathya

1025
01:06:17,846 --> 01:06:18,804
Really!?

1026
01:06:18,868 --> 01:06:20,410
My name is Sathyabama too

1027
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:21,648
We share a name!

1028
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:23,631
Remember I told you
it's a sweet name?

1029
01:06:24,037 --> 01:06:24,812
Now you know why

1030
01:06:24,837 --> 01:06:26,962
Actually, ma, my name
is also Sathyabama

1031
01:06:27,757 --> 01:06:29,507
The girls at college
will tease me

1032
01:06:29,532 --> 01:06:30,679
So I shortened it to Sathya

1033
01:06:30,704 --> 01:06:32,704
It suits you
Come inside, dear

1034
01:06:33,963 --> 01:06:34,963
Come in

1035
01:06:38,547 --> 01:06:39,611
1

1036
01:06:39,742 --> 01:06:40,659
2

1037
01:06:40,951 --> 01:06:41,909
3

1038
01:06:42,484 --> 01:06:44,151
My sari is stained

1039
01:06:44,255 --> 01:06:45,255
What do I do now?

1040
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:46,733
It was fine when I packed it

1041
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:47,995
Ma, what is this?

1042
01:06:48,078 --> 01:06:49,952
Bad enough a girl's tyre
is not safe around here

1043
01:06:49,977 --> 01:06:51,160
Now even her sari isn't safe

1044
01:06:51,185 --> 01:06:53,726
What are these anti-corruption
movements doing?

1045
01:06:53,908 --> 01:06:55,116
Can I take a look?

1046
01:06:55,557 --> 01:06:56,624
Spilt all over

1047
01:06:56,649 --> 01:06:59,108
Looks like it is
a well planned ploy

1048
01:06:59,575 --> 01:07:01,427
Looks like ink has been
splashed artistically!

1049
01:07:01,578 --> 01:07:03,327
What a wretched fellow
with a disgusting mindset

1050
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,269
Now what do I do?

1051
01:07:04,429 --> 01:07:05,763
Poor child!

1052
01:07:05,914 --> 01:07:07,123
Ma, tell her

1053
01:07:07,281 --> 01:07:08,679
I'm a watch mechanic, you know

1054
01:07:08,749 --> 01:07:10,791
All this is child's play for me

1055
01:07:11,187 --> 01:07:12,158
Wait a minute

1056
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:12,852
Ma, come inside

1057
01:07:12,892 --> 01:07:13,438
Where to?

1058
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:14,630
Come in, I say

1059
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,809
Quick! Give me your sari

1060
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:19,008
How can I give my sari to that girl?

1061
01:07:19,033 --> 01:07:20,241
Who asked for your sari?

1062
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:22,774
That pink sari you bought
in Saravana Stores for Rs 8000

1063
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:24,813
- You were ironing it this morning
- In your dreams!

1064
01:07:24,901 --> 01:07:27,526
I bought that sari with
so much love for your wife-to-be

1065
01:07:27,802 --> 01:07:29,751
- I can't part with that
- Ma, don't say 'no'

1066
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:32,719
You don't realize the feelings of
the son you carried for 10 months!

1067
01:07:32,744 --> 01:07:33,994
She is the one!

1068
01:07:34,478 --> 01:07:35,311
Really?

1069
01:07:35,943 --> 01:07:37,068
Don't pull a fast one

1070
01:07:37,252 --> 01:07:39,585
My God! She's so beautiful!

1071
01:07:39,674 --> 01:07:41,063
Did you find out about her family?

1072
01:07:41,088 --> 01:07:43,032
Don't frighten her away
with your over enthusiasm!

1073
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:44,938
Step by step, we shall
proceed slowly

1074
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,732
Okay...okay
- Give me that sari

1075
01:07:46,936 --> 01:07:47,633
 I'll get it, you go

1076
01:07:47,658 --> 01:07:49,158
You're a darling!

1077
01:08:19,747 --> 01:08:21,108
Does it look good?

1078
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,375
You look terrible

1079
01:08:23,456 --> 01:08:24,539
Why?

1080
01:08:25,078 --> 01:08:26,399
Then what?

1081
01:08:26,424 --> 01:08:28,758
You know very well
you look gorgeous

1082
01:08:28,783 --> 01:08:30,575
Then why fish for compliments?

1083
01:08:30,882 --> 01:08:34,424
All these beautiful women
need a constant endorsement!

1084
01:08:34,481 --> 01:08:36,314
You saw yourself
in the mirror, right?

1085
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:38,016
I really want to know
why even ask?

1086
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:39,041
Just...

1087
01:08:39,217 --> 01:08:40,508
...casually!

1088
01:08:40,953 --> 01:08:43,745
'Generally speaking, I have a high
general knowledge quotient!'

1089
01:09:07,028 --> 01:09:08,861
She forgot her 'bindi'

1090
01:09:35,182 --> 01:09:36,307
'Flowers?'

1091
01:09:51,637 --> 01:09:52,512
What happened?

1092
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:53,792
Exercise

1093
01:09:53,817 --> 01:09:55,317
My breathing exercise!

1094
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:07,292
What is happening here?

1095
01:10:07,637 --> 01:10:09,806
I told you today is
my grandpa's birthday

1096
01:10:10,118 --> 01:10:11,841
Back home it will be
celebrated as a special day

1097
01:10:11,866 --> 01:10:13,241
So I thought
I would come here

1098
01:10:13,266 --> 01:10:14,308
That's a lovely thought

1099
01:10:14,495 --> 01:10:14,961
Thanks

1100
01:10:14,986 --> 01:10:15,986
My pleasure

1101
01:10:17,802 --> 01:10:18,802
Don't

1102
01:10:18,827 --> 01:10:20,077
You look beautiful

1103
01:10:20,102 --> 01:10:21,907
'Bindi' and jasmine
are perfect accessories

1104
01:10:21,932 --> 01:10:23,991
Really...!
Let us...go

1105
01:10:24,503 --> 01:10:25,526

Welcome, please come

1107
01:10:26,905 --> 01:10:28,072
- Hello, ma'am

01:10:28,097 --> 01:10:29,469

The food you ordered

Siva, chair please

1111

1112
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,182
Thanks

1113

(Cricket commentary)

1114
01:11:07,812 --> 01:11:09,104
Cheer up, children

1115
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,907
Come and see the goodies
ma'am has brought for you

1116
01:11:11,932 --> 01:11:13,016
Come on
Get up

1117
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,541
Let's all eat

1118
01:11:24,122 --> 01:11:25,258
India should have won

1119
01:11:25,283 --> 01:11:27,699
At least for these kids
India should have won

1120
01:11:28,338 --> 01:11:30,671
Just imagine how
they would have rejoiced!

1121
01:11:30,807 --> 01:11:32,836
The kids would have
cheered and danced

1122
01:11:32,861 --> 01:11:35,111
Our ear drums would
have been flat out!

1123
01:11:40,912 --> 01:11:43,078
(cricket commentary)

1124
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:45,418
Hello?

1125
01:11:45,443 --> 01:11:46,276
Yes, ma?

1126
01:11:46,372 --> 01:11:47,157
What?

1127
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:48,307
I'll be right there

1128
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:49,797
My mother on the phone

1129
01:11:49,822 --> 01:11:51,137
Customer
I'll be there right now

1130
01:11:51,372 --> 01:11:52,997
I'll be there
in 5 minutes, ma

1131
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:55,624
Okay...okay, ma

1132
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,705
(loud cheering)

1133
01:14:02,453 --> 01:14:04,745
(loud cheering)

1134
01:14:12,049 --> 01:14:13,090
Eat well, children

1135
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,157
Don't waste anything

1136
01:14:14,595 --> 01:14:15,649
Would you like some more?

1137
01:14:15,674 --> 01:14:16,841
Dhoni did it

1138
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:20,385
The sixer just flew into the sky
I was so scared he would catch it

1139
01:14:22,179 --> 01:14:23,138
Hi

1140
01:14:24,213 --> 01:14:26,088
I heard we won

1141
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:28,446
As usual, Dhoni hit
a sixer off the last ball

1142
01:14:28,521 --> 01:14:30,879
The kids must have been
so happy and excited

1143
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:33,039
They must have cheered
ripping your ear drums off

1144
01:14:33,064 --> 01:14:34,358
You should have seen them

1145
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:36,325
But tell me this
Where did you disappear?

1146
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:37,211
I had to go-

1147
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,639
My mother called to say
a customer was waiting

1148
01:14:39,664 --> 01:14:40,497
I went to see him

1149
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:42,008
The customer was at
Chepauk stadium, huh?

1150
01:14:42,428 --> 01:14:44,303
Chepauk...stadium?

1151
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:46,246
I saw you
On TV!

1152
01:14:53,265 --> 01:14:55,973
You were going home
Why were you at the stadium?

1153
01:14:55,998 --> 01:14:58,414
You must have mistaken
someone else for me

1154
01:14:58,612 --> 01:14:59,539
Don't be a bluff master

1155
01:14:59,564 --> 01:15:00,743
Same shirt
Same trousers

1156
01:15:00,768 --> 01:15:01,977
Tell me the truth now

1157
01:15:02,257 --> 01:15:03,868
You saw me
on TV for sure?

1158
01:15:03,948 --> 01:15:05,115
I am 100% sure

1159
01:15:05,942 --> 01:15:07,192
Gone case!

1160
01:15:07,555 --> 01:15:09,188
What I was hoping won't happen...

1161
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:09,975
...has happened

1162
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,166
What are you saying?

1163
01:15:11,268 --> 01:15:13,726
This is a disease affecting
pretty, young girls

1164
01:15:13,751 --> 01:15:17,648
Especially popular among
girls in your age group

1165
01:15:17,673 --> 01:15:18,297
It's called

1166
01:15:18,322 --> 01:15:19,646
Imaginoromansophilia

1167
01:15:19,866 --> 01:15:21,116
Imagino-what?

1168
01:15:21,255 --> 01:15:22,630
Supposing you-

1169
01:15:22,655 --> 01:15:25,182
If you love someone and
I don't mean the normal kind

1170
01:15:25,536 --> 01:15:27,077
If your love is strong and deep

1171
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:28,769
if you love him truly, madly, deeply

1172
01:15:28,794 --> 01:15:31,129
Then whomever you see
will be like his clone!

1173
01:15:31,508 --> 01:15:32,342
It's called

1174
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:33,992
Imaginoromansophilia

1175
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:35,291
What is this nonsense?

1176
01:15:35,316 --> 01:15:37,399
I'm in love with you?
And that too, strong love

1177
01:15:37,424 --> 01:15:39,630
You're getting angry instead
of me losing my temper!

1178
01:15:39,655 --> 01:15:41,071
You just said
you saw me on TV

1179
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:43,243
Next it'll be a hoarding,
And here, there, everywhere

1180
01:15:43,355 --> 01:15:45,523
You'll then say I fixed
the flowers and 'bindi' on you?

1181
01:15:45,705 --> 01:15:47,371
- Look! This is too much
- Why?

1182
01:15:47,611 --> 01:15:49,007
How will I fall in love with you?

1183
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:51,545
I saw you for 10 minutes in
the morning and 1 hour now

1184
01:15:51,603 --> 01:15:53,523
- How can I fall in love so soon?
- Yeah exactly

1185
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:55,091
I should be saying all this

1186
01:15:55,164 --> 01:15:57,623
You're the one who claims
you saw me everywhere

1187
01:15:57,648 --> 01:15:59,523
It's called Imaginoromansophilia

1188
01:15:59,548 --> 01:16:00,832
You've got it really bad

1189
01:16:01,084 --> 01:16:02,135
I'll prove it to you

1190
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,112
You don't believe me, right?

1191
01:16:03,549 --> 01:16:04,755
I'll prove it

1192
01:16:05,077 --> 01:16:06,452
Do you see that caterer?

1193
01:16:06,477 --> 01:16:07,144
Can you see him?

1194
01:16:07,311 --> 01:16:08,675
Look at him
You'll think it's me

1195
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:10,291
Please look at the dragon

1196
01:16:19,731 --> 01:16:20,856
Hi

1197
01:16:28,178 --> 01:16:29,402
Did you see me?

1198
01:16:30,404 --> 01:16:31,737
He looked like my clone?

1199
01:16:31,894 --> 01:16:32,553
Aiyaiyo!

1200
01:16:32,683 --> 01:16:34,116
It has spread

1201
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:35,857
Don't worry
I'll be there for you

1202
01:16:36,048 --> 01:16:38,548
Let's check one last time
for our own confirmation

1203
01:16:38,865 --> 01:16:39,480
Okay?

1204
01:16:39,505 --> 01:16:40,838
Look at that gardener

1205
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:47,054
Hi

1206
01:16:50,211 --> 01:16:51,545
What happened?

1207
01:16:53,143 --> 01:16:54,268
I'm a watch mechanic

1208
01:16:54,349 --> 01:16:55,140
Breathing exercise!

1209
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,619
The gardener didn't
resemble me, did he?

1210
01:16:57,757 --> 01:16:58,746
He looked ditto you!

1211
01:16:58,771 --> 01:16:59,563
Whaaat?

1212
01:16:59,588 --> 01:17:00,998
That gardener resembled me?

1213
01:17:01,023 --> 01:17:02,439
Don't you think this is too much?

1214
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:04,297
I'm basically a simple
watch mechanic

1215
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,416
I may help out for
the welfare of our nation

1216
01:17:06,565 --> 01:17:08,363
But if girls fall flat
for such reasons!

1217
01:17:08,388 --> 01:17:09,356
I understand

1218
01:17:09,381 --> 01:17:10,384
You are different

1219
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:12,816
You love me sincerely
Truly, madly, deeply

1220
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:13,716
No, I don't

1221
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:14,879
I don't blame you

1222
01:17:14,904 --> 01:17:16,713
It isn't your fault
Don't blame yourself

1223
01:17:16,854 --> 01:17:17,646
But...

1224
01:17:17,671 --> 01:17:20,130
...basically, I am
a watch mechanic

1225
01:17:20,343 --> 01:17:22,822
I prefer to marry a girl
my mother selects

1226
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,776
And love her
till death do us part!

1227
01:17:24,801 --> 01:17:26,472
Whatever you feel,
tell my mother directly

1228
01:17:26,497 --> 01:17:27,789
But you do love me

1229
01:17:28,028 --> 01:17:29,855
...deeply, truly,
honest to God

1230
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,047
And very sincere

1231
01:17:31,264 --> 01:17:32,473
Please don't forget that

1232
01:17:32,498 --> 01:17:33,623
It's a kind request

1233
01:17:33,753 --> 01:17:34,753
See you

1234
01:17:34,935 --> 01:17:35,893
Bye

1235
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:37,112
But

1236
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:40,002
SONG TO BE FILLED@

1237
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:56,999
'Today is August 15th'

1238
01:21:57,024 --> 01:22:00,673
'Not just our city, the entire nation
is celebrating Independence Day'

1239
01:22:00,698 --> 01:22:02,278
'They have organized
various programs'

1240
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:06,206
'Call and tell us exactly what
Independence Day means to you'

1241
01:22:06,231 --> 01:22:09,268
'Husband endorsed
his wife's secret lover!'

1242
01:22:09,702 --> 01:22:10,786
Yuck!

1243
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:12,541
And this hits the headlines!

1244
01:22:21,065 --> 01:22:22,065
Subramani

1245
01:22:22,363 --> 01:22:23,596
Mani, wake up

1246
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:25,252
Get up, Mani

1247
01:22:25,385 --> 01:22:26,768
- Don't bug me
- Wake up

1248
01:22:26,793 --> 01:22:28,108
- Let me sleep some more
- Get up

1249
01:22:28,219 --> 01:22:29,219
What?

1250
01:22:29,759 --> 01:22:31,301
Aren't you my childhood friend?

1251
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,197
- Yes, I am
- We are inseparable?

1252
01:22:33,222 --> 01:22:36,013
All these years as a watch mechanic,
have you ever helped me?

1253
01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:37,526
- No
- Not once, right?

1254
01:22:37,599 --> 01:22:39,349
Read this

1255
01:22:42,078 --> 01:22:44,537
'Golden opportunity
Prize money 5 crores'

1256
01:22:49,174 --> 01:22:51,780
They have promised
50 million for this watch

1257
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:52,936
5 crores, imagine!

1258
01:22:52,961 --> 01:22:54,536
Pay close attention
to what I'm saying

1259
01:22:54,655 --> 01:22:57,322
How many heads will I tonsure
to earn this kind of amount?

1260
01:22:57,536 --> 01:22:59,963
Mani, somehow make
a duplicate of this watch

1261
01:23:00,093 --> 01:23:03,218
I'm sure we can get
at least 50,000 for it

1262
01:23:03,354 --> 01:23:06,899
I'll keep just 40,000
and give you 10,000

1263
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:08,884
There's something
called 'hard work'!

1264
01:23:09,015 --> 01:23:11,015
But please don't say 'no'

1265
01:23:11,965 --> 01:23:13,006
- Yes?
- Okay

1266
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:15,073
True to your name
you're such a gem!

1267
01:23:26,655 --> 01:23:28,739
'This has been with me
for so many years'

1268
01:23:29,518 --> 01:23:32,268
'But only now I realized
how unique it is'

1269
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:34,916
'How is Phoenix company
aware of its existence?'

1270
01:23:36,526 --> 01:23:39,068
'If this company is offering
50 million for this watch...

1271
01:23:39,224 --> 01:23:43,640
'...then they are also aware of
the time travel power of this watch'

1272
01:23:44,752 --> 01:23:47,377
'How are they linked
to this rare watch?'

1273
01:23:48,193 --> 01:23:49,068
'Then...?'

1274
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:52,208
'How are they connected to me?'

1275
01:23:53,523 --> 01:23:54,607
'Who are they?'

1276
01:24:15,065 --> 01:24:17,565
Mani, did you
underestimate a salon?

1277
01:24:17,763 --> 01:24:18,971
It's like a school

1278
01:24:18,996 --> 01:24:20,863
You broaden your mind
internationally there

1279
01:24:20,888 --> 01:24:23,557
We make our clients read newspapers
and they share news generously

1280
01:24:23,582 --> 01:24:25,635
Do any of your customers
read the newspaper?

1281
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:28,041
When I get the 50 million in my hands...

1282
01:24:28,066 --> 01:24:30,529
...I will have gold scissors
and silver blades in my salon

1283
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:32,020
Don't you worry, Mani

1284
01:24:32,182 --> 01:24:33,710
I'll take care of everythi-

1285
01:24:35,316 --> 01:24:36,524
Wretched fellows!

1286
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:39,098
When did they start
reading the newspaper?

1287
01:24:39,257 --> 01:24:42,257
All of them have duplicated
the watch to grab the prize money

1288
01:24:42,282 --> 01:24:43,456
Mani, my childhood friend

1289
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:44,834
Will your watch
pass muster?

1290
01:24:44,859 --> 01:24:45,944
Will we get anything at all?

1291
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:48,340
Stand in queue
I'll be right back

1292
01:24:49,796 --> 01:24:51,421
Goodness gracious!

1293
01:24:59,662 --> 01:25:01,081
Yes, sir
Your name and address?

1294
01:25:01,106 --> 01:25:02,522
Well, my name is Mani

1295
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:03,777
Mani Watch Works

1296
01:25:04,393 --> 01:25:06,393
New #6
Old #16

1297
01:25:06,578 --> 01:25:08,078
Watchmaker's Street

1298
01:25:08,143 --> 01:25:10,268
Parry's corner
Chennai - 1

1299
01:25:15,216 --> 01:25:16,049
Mani

1300
01:25:16,203 --> 01:25:17,986
Token #144

1301
01:25:18,138 --> 01:25:20,166
I'll be in my 70s
by the time they call us

1302
01:25:20,286 --> 01:25:21,744
Okay
Sit here

1303
01:25:21,918 --> 01:25:23,043
I'll be nearby

1304
01:25:23,103 --> 01:25:26,061
Call me when they announce
our token number

1305
01:26:26,422 --> 01:26:28,672
Managing Director- Mithran

1306
01:26:28,697 --> 01:26:30,739
Chairman - Athreya

1307
01:26:40,794 --> 01:26:42,752
I can't believe it, sir

1308
01:26:48,418 --> 01:26:49,145
So many people-

1309
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,087
Mithra

1310
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,737
Let's talk inside

1311
01:27:02,997 --> 01:27:03,942
What is it, sir?

1312
01:27:04,069 --> 01:27:05,987
You wanted to tell me
something urgent

1313
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:07,137
Mithra

1314
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:08,769
We have got it!

1315
01:27:10,138 --> 01:27:12,679
What we were searching
high and low all this while...

1316
01:27:14,276 --> 01:27:16,151
...has come in search of us

1317
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:22,818
Token # 144

1318
01:27:25,036 --> 01:27:27,327
'Token # 144'

1319
01:27:28,413 --> 01:27:30,143
All the watches we've got
so far are duplicates

1320
01:27:30,168 --> 01:27:31,209
I checked them myself

1321
01:27:31,588 --> 01:27:33,256
How can you be sure
this one is original?

1322
01:27:33,508 --> 01:27:35,425
This is also a duplicate

1323
01:27:36,096 --> 01:27:38,054
But the maker of this watch...

1324
01:27:38,544 --> 01:27:40,377
...has the original with him

1325
01:27:41,307 --> 01:27:43,474
In the paper advertisement...

1326
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:46,674
...we had given only
the front picture of the watch

1327
01:27:47,725 --> 01:27:50,350
All of them out there
who duplicated it...

1328
01:27:50,495 --> 01:27:52,995
...have created
only the front dial

1329
01:27:53,254 --> 01:27:54,295
But

1330
01:27:55,802 --> 01:27:57,261
Look at this

1331
01:28:04,991 --> 01:28:08,616
He is the only one who has
duplicated the original

1332
01:28:09,565 --> 01:28:14,773
How else will he know the words
'Project 24' engraved at the back?

1333
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,463
Replay the entire footage of
the CCTV camera from this morning

1334
01:28:20,632 --> 01:28:23,799
Token # 144

1335
01:28:24,935 --> 01:28:26,560
I want to see him

1336
01:28:41,143 --> 01:28:42,476
Mithra

1337
01:28:45,595 --> 01:28:47,137
Play the live feed

1338
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,625
I want to see what he's doing now

1339
01:28:55,983 --> 01:28:57,025
Mithra

1340
01:28:58,124 --> 01:28:59,374
Something fishy

1341
01:28:59,399 --> 01:29:01,024
What do you mean, sir?

1342
01:29:01,427 --> 01:29:03,052
Look carefully, Mithra

1343
01:29:05,248 --> 01:29:07,789
He has no idea
what's happening here

1344
01:29:08,955 --> 01:29:10,997
Bring him to the conference room

1345
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:13,365
And wait for my instructions

1346
01:29:26,183 --> 01:29:27,141
Excuse me, sir

1347
01:29:27,307 --> 01:29:28,974
The person you wanted to meet

1348
01:29:30,837 --> 01:29:31,920
Hello

1349
01:29:32,794 --> 01:29:33,737
You are Mr...?

1350
01:29:33,862 --> 01:29:34,570
Sara-

1351
01:29:34,705 --> 01:29:36,413
 - Mani
- Congratulations

1352
01:29:36,517 --> 01:29:37,767
You've won the competition

1353
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,417
Your watch has been selected

1354
01:29:39,442 --> 01:29:41,067
The prize money
is all yours

1355
01:29:41,135 --> 01:29:42,019
Aiyo!

1356
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:43,978
Sir, what is your name?

1357
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:45,251
Mithran

1358
01:29:45,317 --> 01:29:46,159
You aren't Mithran

1359
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,755
You are my lucky mascot-man!

1360
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:48,696
Don't go anywhere

1361
01:29:48,721 --> 01:29:50,138
Sir, I won't move an inch

1362
01:29:50,163 --> 01:29:51,663
I'll be right here

1363
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:58,315
Mani, you are truly a genius

1364
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:04,538
I can't believe we just won 50 million!

1365
01:30:41,717 --> 01:30:42,633
Sir

1366
01:30:42,925 --> 01:30:44,883
Go to the conference room again

1367
01:30:45,842 --> 01:30:48,092
Thrash that duplicate

1368
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:50,967
Ask him where the original is!

1369
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,050
Okay, sir

1370
01:30:56,883 --> 01:30:59,217
What about the cash, sir?
Are they counting it?

1371
01:31:09,217 --> 01:31:10,883
Please don't hit me

1372
01:31:13,508 --> 01:31:14,508
Tell me, sir

1373
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:16,550
Bring him in front of the camera

1374
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:21,650
Call your accomplice

1375
01:31:21,675 --> 01:31:23,092
Call him

1376
01:31:24,592 --> 01:31:25,967
Mani

1377
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:28,217
I can't bear the pain

1378
01:31:28,467 --> 01:31:30,550
It really hurts, Mani

1379
01:31:30,633 --> 01:31:32,633
I can't take it any longer

1380
01:31:35,675 --> 01:31:37,175
Where are you?

1381
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,425
Mani

1382
01:31:38,967 --> 01:31:40,883
Come soon

1383
01:31:40,967 --> 01:31:42,758
Aiyo! I can't take-

1384
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,550
I can't take this any longer

1385
01:31:44,815 --> 01:31:46,773
Call him loudly

1386
01:31:47,008 --> 01:31:48,092
Mani...!

1387
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:52,592
For 26 years I was
vegetating in the same spot

1388
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:56,258
I was wondering why
I came out of that state

1389
01:33:56,342 --> 01:33:58,435
You are the answer
standing before me

1390
01:34:04,328 --> 01:34:08,870
Your father snatched my youth
and passed it on to you

1391
01:34:09,883 --> 01:34:13,175
Are you wondering who I am?

1392
01:34:16,467 --> 01:34:17,342
Go

1393
01:34:17,425 --> 01:34:19,008
Heaven's gates are open for you

1394
01:34:19,092 --> 01:34:20,883
Go and meet your father there

1395
01:34:20,967 --> 01:34:22,300
Ask him

1396
01:34:23,175 --> 01:34:24,925
Your mother will also welcome you

1397
01:34:25,008 --> 01:34:25,911
Ask her too

1398
01:34:30,365 --> 01:34:33,406
When you ask them
focus on their eyes

1399
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:36,709
The fear in their eyes will tell you

1400
01:34:36,867 --> 01:34:39,034
Who Athreya is!

1401
01:34:56,508 --> 01:35:00,925
"Ayushman bhava"

1402
01:35:27,592 --> 01:35:31,550
"May you have without strife
a long and healthy life"

1403
01:35:32,651 --> 01:35:36,234
"May you live long
Healthy and strong"

1404
01:35:46,049 --> 01:35:47,966
Ayushman Bhava!

1405
01:35:49,305 --> 01:35:51,014
Did you see his lifeline?

1406
01:35:51,365 --> 01:35:52,740
It stretches a mile long!

1407
01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:55,767
Such a tragedy to die so young

1408
01:35:56,767 --> 01:35:58,350
- Mithra
- Sir?

1409
01:35:58,433 --> 01:36:00,475
Remember the hologram?

1410
01:36:01,558 --> 01:36:03,683
To charge the watch...

1411
01:36:03,975 --> 01:36:08,183
...the wearer of the watch must pass
electric current through his body

1412
01:36:09,475 --> 01:36:11,517
Even in death he is useful

1413
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:56,350
Mithra

1414
01:36:58,850 --> 01:37:01,975
I'll travel 26 years
into the past now

1415
01:37:03,433 --> 01:37:06,600
History, achievements, glory,
challenges met in this world...

1416
01:37:06,683 --> 01:37:10,017
...shall surrender under my feet!

1417
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:12,058
Come here

1418
01:37:12,142 --> 01:37:14,142
You touch the watch too

1419
01:37:14,392 --> 01:37:18,267
I want you too along with
the lost memories of all these years

1420
01:37:18,642 --> 01:37:19,558
Come

1421
01:37:20,308 --> 01:37:21,850
We shall time-travel together

1422
01:38:15,475 --> 01:38:16,392
Project

1423
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:18,017
24

1424
01:38:19,683 --> 01:38:21,142
Twenty four

1425
01:38:32,642 --> 01:38:34,433
Mithra

1426
01:38:37,517 --> 01:38:38,350
Sir?

1427
01:38:38,767 --> 01:38:39,600
Sir

1428
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:41,558
I can't believe it, sir

1429
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,183
I was right next to you

1430
01:38:43,308 --> 01:38:45,600
And now I'm in my house!

1431
01:38:45,683 --> 01:38:46,642
'Mithra...?'

1432
01:38:46,683 --> 01:38:47,517
Sir

1433
01:38:47,975 --> 01:38:49,308
That watch

1434
01:38:49,725 --> 01:38:50,600
I swear-

1435
01:38:50,683 --> 01:38:51,392
'Mithraaa!'

1436
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:00,267
Sir, what happened!?

1437
01:39:00,308 --> 01:39:01,850
He defeated us

1438
01:39:02,975 --> 01:39:05,475
Sethuraman has won

1439
01:39:07,683 --> 01:39:10,975
Why do you think
he named it 'Project 24'?

1440
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:18,433
This watch can only take us
back in time for 24 hours

1441
01:39:20,683 --> 01:39:23,058
26 years

1442
01:39:23,517 --> 01:39:27,433
It cannot take us to even
yesterday or tomorrow!

1443
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:29,642
What do we do now, sir?

1444
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:32,642
To fix this properly

1445
01:39:33,267 --> 01:39:35,433
There is only 1 person in the world

1446
01:39:35,725 --> 01:39:36,892
Mani

1447
01:39:38,017 --> 01:39:40,142
Sethuraman's son

1448
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:41,600
But we killed him, sir

1449
01:39:41,642 --> 01:39:44,642
Only now we test
his long lifeline!

1450
01:39:45,725 --> 01:39:47,183
Look at the date

1451
01:39:47,725 --> 01:39:49,058
Note the time now

1452
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,683
We've come back
to the same day

1453
01:39:52,433 --> 01:39:55,475
Our Independence Day
has dawned again!

1454
01:39:56,017 --> 01:39:57,892
We haven't killed him as yet

1455
01:39:58,767 --> 01:40:00,475
He's at home
fast as sleep

1456
01:40:01,725 --> 01:40:03,267
2 points to keep in mind

1457
01:40:03,392 --> 01:40:05,308
How did he even
find out about us?

1458
01:40:05,683 --> 01:40:06,975
The advertisement

1459
01:40:07,308 --> 01:40:08,850
He came after he saw it

1460
01:40:08,892 --> 01:40:09,892
He will come

1461
01:40:09,933 --> 01:40:11,308
He must not see it

1462
01:40:11,975 --> 01:40:14,642
As of now, he knows
nothing about us

1463
01:40:14,933 --> 01:40:18,225
That advertisement shouldn't be
published in any paper tomorrow

1464
01:40:18,267 --> 01:40:19,600
2nd point to note

1465
01:40:19,933 --> 01:40:20,933
When he wakes up...

1466
01:40:20,975 --> 01:40:22,642
...the watch should
be on his wrist

1467
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:24,892
Otherwise he will suspect
something is amiss

1468
01:41:22,183 --> 01:41:23,350
'Today is August 15th'

1469
01:41:23,392 --> 01:41:26,475
'Not just our city, the entire nation
is celebrating Independence Day'

1470
01:41:26,517 --> 01:41:28,892
'They have organized
various programs'

1471
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:32,350
'Husband endrosed
his wife's secret lover!'

1472
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:38,350
Which is the freebie?

1473
01:41:38,517 --> 01:41:40,475
Either one can
make me happy

1474
01:41:51,725 --> 01:41:52,975
Watch?

1475
01:42:13,142 --> 01:42:14,642
On this hand?

1476
01:42:17,225 --> 01:42:18,975
How is it on this hand?

1477
01:43:46,308 --> 01:43:47,267
Mithra

1478
01:43:48,142 --> 01:43:49,100
Sir

1479
01:43:49,183 --> 01:43:51,058
I did what you asked me to

1480
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:52,725
I hope he didn't see you

1481
01:43:52,808 --> 01:43:53,683
No, sir

1482
01:43:53,725 --> 01:43:55,267
If he saw you...

1483
01:43:55,767 --> 01:43:58,517
...then all our efforts
will go down the drain

1484
01:43:58,600 --> 01:43:59,642
I know

1485
01:44:00,308 --> 01:44:01,642
I'm sure he didn't see me

1486
01:44:02,267 --> 01:44:03,600
But I saw him

1487
01:44:03,683 --> 01:44:06,100
On his wrist was
the watch you invented

1488
01:44:06,183 --> 01:44:07,600
I looked at it closely

1489
01:44:07,642 --> 01:44:08,558
It's working

1490
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,308
But the real shocking-surprise is...

1491
01:44:10,350 --> 01:44:13,100
...he is a carbon copy of you

1492
01:44:29,767 --> 01:44:31,267
Heard that, Priya?

1493
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:32,642
Our son

1494
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:34,558
Resembles me

1495
01:44:35,808 --> 01:44:37,517
Like a carbon copy

1496
01:44:40,308 --> 01:44:43,017
Let him resemble me
in appearance

1497
01:44:43,725 --> 01:44:46,433
But I sincerely pray...his life...

1498
01:44:49,392 --> 01:44:51,058
...should be nothing like mine

1499
01:44:52,558 --> 01:44:53,683
And that is why...

1500
01:44:54,308 --> 01:44:56,683
...even though
I know he is here

1501
01:44:57,517 --> 01:44:59,600
I have kept myself
away from him

1502
01:45:01,725 --> 01:45:04,475
But a father's heart
aches to hug him, Priya

1503
01:45:05,183 --> 01:45:08,017
I wanted to check
if he was okay, just once

1504
01:45:08,058 --> 01:45:10,142
So I had sent Mithran

1505
01:45:11,808 --> 01:45:13,558
He is healthy and happy it seems...

1506
01:45:14,392 --> 01:45:16,183
...and surrounded by good people

1507
01:45:16,267 --> 01:45:17,683
As his parents...

1508
01:45:18,975 --> 01:45:20,850
...what more can we ask for?

1509
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:05,433
How, sir?

1510
01:46:05,517 --> 01:46:08,308
If I fixed the watch
on the wrong hand...

1511
01:46:08,392 --> 01:46:11,808
...how did you guess right
he would follow me here?

1512
01:46:12,308 --> 01:46:14,850
If he is Sethuraman's son...

1513
01:46:15,267 --> 01:46:17,475
...I am Sethuraman's elder brother!

1514
01:46:17,517 --> 01:46:19,058
This is quite a huge task

1515
01:46:19,142 --> 01:46:20,850
Do you think he can do it?

1516
01:46:20,892 --> 01:46:22,892
Only he can do it

1517
01:46:23,725 --> 01:46:26,642
Not having seen his father
or known his father's profession

1518
01:46:26,683 --> 01:46:28,350
...he grew up as a bright lad

1519
01:46:28,392 --> 01:46:29,433
But now

1520
01:46:29,975 --> 01:46:32,517
Look at the profession
he has chosen for himself

1521
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:35,933
He is a watch mechanic

1522
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:40,142
Sethuraman's blood
runs in his veins

1523
01:46:41,642 --> 01:46:43,475
He will definitely
do the impossible!

1524
01:46:46,725 --> 01:46:48,683
If we simply ask him
to tweak the watch

1525
01:46:48,725 --> 01:46:49,850
Or threaten him

1526
01:46:49,892 --> 01:46:51,433
Will he do it for us?

1527
01:46:51,975 --> 01:46:52,975
I shall go

1528
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:56,350
I shall enter his life
as his long lost father

1529
01:46:57,683 --> 01:46:59,600
I'll tell him about his mother

1530
01:46:59,683 --> 01:47:02,517
And make him yearn
to see her again

1531
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:07,933
I'll tell him the cruel story of
how 'Athreya' destroyed his family

1532
01:47:08,892 --> 01:47:10,683
Then he will do it for 'his father'!

1533
01:47:11,767 --> 01:47:14,683
You saw how emotional he was
seeing his mother's photo

1534
01:47:14,892 --> 01:47:16,767
For his biological mother

1535
01:47:17,267 --> 01:47:18,892
He will do it for her

1536
01:47:19,933 --> 01:47:22,767
He will do it
to cure 'his father'

1537
01:47:23,642 --> 01:47:25,475
I'll make him do it!

1538
01:47:26,475 --> 01:47:27,350
Mithra

1539
01:47:28,267 --> 01:47:31,225
Any fool can use the watch
while it is on his hand

1540
01:47:32,267 --> 01:47:36,308
Without even wearing the watch
watch how I get my work done!

1541
01:47:45,183 --> 01:47:46,308
I can't believe it

1542
01:47:46,350 --> 01:47:48,433
My son has suddenly
become enlightened

1543
01:47:48,517 --> 01:47:51,808
He has got up as early as
6 in the morning!

1544
01:47:51,892 --> 01:47:53,308
Must thank the good spirits!

1545
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:55,183
I don't want to jinx it

1546
01:47:57,475 --> 01:47:58,308
Son?

1547
01:47:58,600 --> 01:47:59,850
What's wrong?

1548
01:48:01,183 --> 01:48:02,308
Mani...?

1549
01:48:03,225 --> 01:48:05,725
What happened?
Why are your eyes red?

1550
01:48:05,808 --> 01:48:07,100
What happened?

1551
01:48:13,808 --> 01:48:14,892
Ma-

1552
01:48:14,975 --> 01:48:17,558
I'm not dying to know
who these people are

1553
01:48:18,767 --> 01:48:22,392
I'm asking because it pains me
to know I may not be your son

1554
01:48:23,558 --> 01:48:24,975
Who are we, ma?

1555
01:48:35,892 --> 01:48:37,725
This is your father

1556
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:44,225
As you grew up...

1557
01:48:44,267 --> 01:48:46,975
...I realised this
looking at your face

1558
01:48:50,475 --> 01:48:54,183
He thrust you into my arms
and changed my life forever

1559
01:48:57,392 --> 01:48:59,058
You asked who we are

1560
01:48:59,975 --> 01:49:01,475
Let me rewind
to my past

1561
01:49:03,475 --> 01:49:05,767
Our family is well respected
in our village

1562
01:49:06,308 --> 01:49:08,767
My father, brother,
sister-in-law

1563
01:49:08,808 --> 01:49:10,517
Very close knit family

1564
01:49:11,142 --> 01:49:13,808
I was the apple
of everyone's eyes

1565
01:49:14,767 --> 01:49:17,642
My father believed
girls should also be educated

1566
01:49:17,725 --> 01:49:19,308
And contribute to our society

1567
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:22,683
So he sent me to
a nearby city to study

1568
01:49:24,433 --> 01:49:26,433
One day I got a letter
from my father

1569
01:49:26,475 --> 01:49:28,850
He had found a suitable
groom for me

1570
01:49:28,892 --> 01:49:30,600
And asked me to
come back at once

1571
01:49:30,642 --> 01:49:33,517
'This journey would change
my life's path forever'

1572
01:49:33,558 --> 01:49:35,183
'I didn't know then'

1573
01:49:36,142 --> 01:49:42,100
I saw your father, hurt all over,
carrying you as a baby in his arms

1574
01:49:43,267 --> 01:49:45,225
'He gave you safely
into my arms'

1575
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,517
'I have promised my wife
our son will not be harmed'

1576
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:52,100
'But I am not in a position
to uphold my vow'

1577
01:49:52,183 --> 01:49:53,725
'You should save my son'

1578
01:49:53,808 --> 01:49:55,642
'He said this and
he rushed out'

1579
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:58,058
'I never saw him again'

1580
01:49:59,642 --> 01:50:03,058
My father came to
the station to receive me

1581
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:05,933
Along with my brother, sis-in-law,
the groom's family members

1582
01:50:06,017 --> 01:50:08,517
And all the kith and kin
we ever knew

1583
01:50:08,558 --> 01:50:09,767
A real big crowd

1584
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:12,267
When they were
all waiting for me...

1585
01:50:12,308 --> 01:50:14,517
...I alighted with
a baby in my arms

1586
01:50:14,558 --> 01:50:17,058
Everyone was shocked
including my father

1587
01:50:17,142 --> 01:50:18,517
People jumped to conclusions

1588
01:50:18,558 --> 01:50:21,725
If a girl is sent out of town
to study before she is married...

1589
01:50:21,767 --> 01:50:23,475
...this is how she will come back

1590
01:50:23,517 --> 01:50:25,225
Their comments were
below the belt

1591
01:50:25,308 --> 01:50:28,642
When I recall their harsh words
even now I feel heavy hearted

1592
01:50:29,058 --> 01:50:30,808
Everyone at home fought with me

1593
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:32,767
It was almost like world war 3!

1594
01:50:33,683 --> 01:50:36,725
'Will our villagers digest this
even if we believe you?' they asked

1595
01:50:36,767 --> 01:50:39,058
'Will the groom to-be
accept this baby?'

1596
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:41,350
'Will his family agree?' they asked

1597
01:50:42,267 --> 01:50:43,725
I told my father

1598
01:50:43,767 --> 01:50:48,392
'Father, a promise should never
be broken, come what may'

1599
01:50:48,433 --> 01:50:50,350
'You brought me up
to follow this strictly'

1600
01:50:50,433 --> 01:50:54,183
'I gave this baby's father my word
I would take care of him forever'

1601
01:50:54,225 --> 01:50:55,558
This is what I told my father

1602
01:50:55,642 --> 01:50:57,975
These were the last words
I spoke to him till date

1603
01:50:58,058 --> 01:51:00,183
I carried you to my room

1604
01:51:01,725 --> 01:51:04,267
You cried the whole night
wanting to be nursed

1605
01:51:04,392 --> 01:51:06,642
I couldn't bear your pain
and I wept too

1606
01:51:07,892 --> 01:51:09,683
Finally I decided

1607
01:51:10,392 --> 01:51:14,142
Without becoming a mother
I nursed you myself

1608
01:51:14,308 --> 01:51:19,600
That is when I realised
the value of motherhood

1609
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:24,892
I forgot I was a daughter

1610
01:51:25,433 --> 01:51:27,267
I decided to be your mother

1611
01:51:27,350 --> 01:51:30,267
I did not want any problem
to arise because of my son

1612
01:51:30,308 --> 01:51:31,975
So I left the house
I was born in

1613
01:51:32,058 --> 01:51:33,308
From that day onwards...

1614
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:36,808
...you are the centre of
my entire universe

1615
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:39,225
Let me confess now

1616
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:42,850
Like you did to
your biological mother...

1617
01:51:42,892 --> 01:51:44,433
...you did not kick
in my womb

1618
01:51:44,475 --> 01:51:47,517
But for 26 years, I have
carried you in my heart!

1619
01:51:48,475 --> 01:51:50,517
I am your mother

1620
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:53,975
Whatever anyone may say
I am your mother

1621
01:51:54,225 --> 01:51:55,933
Let them say what they want

1622
01:51:55,975 --> 01:51:57,558
I am your real mother

1623
01:51:59,767 --> 01:52:00,683
Amma

1624
01:52:00,933 --> 01:52:02,767
Don't cry, son

1625
01:52:02,975 --> 01:52:05,100
Look at me

1626
01:52:06,475 --> 01:52:08,308
Take me to your father

1627
01:52:08,808 --> 01:52:10,350
I have to tell him

1628
01:52:10,642 --> 01:52:13,475
I promised you I would
take care of your son

1629
01:52:13,517 --> 01:52:15,850
I must tell him
I've kept my word

1630
01:52:15,892 --> 01:52:16,933
Take me to him

1631
01:52:18,767 --> 01:52:20,433
'Mother...father'

1632
01:52:20,683 --> 01:52:23,267
I lost them before knowing
the meaning of those words

1633
01:52:23,933 --> 01:52:25,392
That isn't a big deal

1634
01:52:26,392 --> 01:52:29,433
Because ever since I can remember...

1635
01:52:29,767 --> 01:52:32,517
...you have been my mother,
father, my everything

1636
01:52:33,017 --> 01:52:34,142
But you...

1637
01:52:35,933 --> 01:52:38,142
...lived for 20 years
with your parents

1638
01:52:38,308 --> 01:52:40,433
You were brought up
with such love and care

1639
01:52:41,267 --> 01:52:43,058
You gave it all up for me

1640
01:52:44,933 --> 01:52:46,683
You raised me all by yourself

1641
01:52:48,308 --> 01:52:51,933
Who can be more important
to me than you, ma?

1642
01:52:52,642 --> 01:52:55,142
Forget the people
I never really had

1643
01:52:56,017 --> 01:52:59,350
But I must reunite you
with your family

1644
01:53:00,475 --> 01:53:01,892
That is my priority

1645
01:53:03,767 --> 01:53:04,767
Mathaji

1646
01:53:05,808 --> 01:53:08,350
Your activities have been
fishy right from the start

1647
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,142
Silly fellow!

1648
01:53:58,517 --> 01:53:59,975
Sister-in-law

1649
01:54:02,892 --> 01:54:04,600
'Friday'

1650
01:54:47,892 --> 01:54:49,058
Father?

1651
01:55:05,725 --> 01:55:07,058
Father

1652
01:55:16,183 --> 01:55:17,683
How are you, dear?

1653
01:55:21,892 --> 01:55:22,892
Mani

1654
01:55:23,517 --> 01:55:24,850
Your grandson

1655
01:55:26,183 --> 01:55:27,058
Hey!

1656
01:55:27,392 --> 01:55:28,392
Come here

1657
01:55:29,725 --> 01:55:32,058
In 1 day you took
your mother away from us

1658
01:55:32,142 --> 01:55:34,850
But to bring her back...

1659
01:55:34,933 --> 01:55:37,058
...it took you so long, huh?

1660
01:55:37,725 --> 01:55:39,183
Why are you standing there?

1661
01:55:39,225 --> 01:55:40,558
Give your grandpa a hug

1662
01:55:40,642 --> 01:55:42,058
This is your grandfather

1663
01:55:42,850 --> 01:55:44,933
Father broke his vow
Why should we wait?

1664
01:55:45,017 --> 01:55:46,558
It's 6'o clock

1665
01:55:47,558 --> 01:55:48,558
- Sis-in-law?
- Sathya

1666
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,058
How have you been?

1667
01:55:51,267 --> 01:55:53,142
Let us all go inside

1668
01:55:53,183 --> 01:55:55,183
You forgot all of us, didn't you?

1669
01:55:55,933 --> 01:55:57,725
(Overlap of excited voices)

1670
01:56:06,558 --> 01:56:07,725
Who is this, grandpa?

1671
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:10,350
This is your great-grandfather

1672
01:56:10,933 --> 01:56:13,100
The school you saw
on your way here?

1673
01:56:13,142 --> 01:56:15,225
He built that school

1674
01:56:15,517 --> 01:56:16,850
Next...?

1675
01:56:17,017 --> 01:56:18,267
This is your-

1676
01:56:18,308 --> 01:56:19,600
Grandpa

1677
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:21,225
Who is this?

1678
01:56:21,642 --> 01:56:24,183
She looks like a square peg
in a round hole!

1679
01:56:24,225 --> 01:56:25,267
That girl?

1680
01:56:25,308 --> 01:56:26,933
Your uncle's daughter

1681
01:56:27,017 --> 01:56:27,975
Sathya

1682
01:56:28,017 --> 01:56:29,725
- Really?
- Sathyabama!

1683
01:56:30,392 --> 01:56:32,058
Your mother wasn't with me

1684
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:34,725
So I named my granddaughter
after your mother

1685
01:56:35,558 --> 01:56:37,392
She is somewhere around

1686
01:56:37,433 --> 01:56:39,392
I think she has gone out

1687
01:56:39,475 --> 01:56:40,725
She will be back now

1688
01:56:42,183 --> 01:56:43,642
Brilliant girl

1689
01:56:44,642 --> 01:56:46,683
Nobody can fool her

1690
01:56:47,058 --> 01:56:48,183
Soooper smart

1691
01:56:52,517 --> 01:56:53,350
Ma...?

1692
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:56,725
Where is everyone?

1693
01:56:59,558 --> 01:57:01,392
Didn't even tell me their program

1694
01:57:03,933 --> 01:57:05,100
Hi

1695
01:57:05,475 --> 01:57:06,600
Good lord!

1696
01:57:10,267 --> 01:57:11,933
Has it started again?

1697
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:18,017
Lord Muruga...Muruga, help me

1698
01:57:24,725 --> 01:57:26,975
He predicted this would happen

1699
01:57:28,142 --> 01:57:29,850
I was fine
all these days

1700
01:57:38,225 --> 01:57:39,725
I told you so!

1701
01:57:39,767 --> 01:57:41,892
You have Imaginoromansophilia!

1702
01:57:42,975 --> 01:57:44,100
Why me...?

1703
01:57:44,392 --> 01:57:45,600
 As it is I'm not well

1704
01:57:45,642 --> 01:57:47,225
You're adding fuel
to the fire

1705
01:57:47,683 --> 01:57:49,017
Oh my God!

1706
01:57:49,558 --> 01:57:51,100
You could hear me?

1707
01:57:53,008 --> 01:57:54,133
Look at me

1708
01:57:54,633 --> 01:57:56,842
First, you saw me
when I wasn't even there

1709
01:57:56,925 --> 01:57:59,092
That means you fell in love with me

1710
01:57:59,133 --> 01:58:00,717
That's symptom #1

1711
01:58:00,758 --> 01:58:01,633
And now

1712
01:58:01,967 --> 01:58:03,592
You can hear me

1713
01:58:04,217 --> 01:58:05,800
That's symptom #2

1714
01:58:06,425 --> 01:58:07,633
What does this mean?

1715
01:58:07,675 --> 01:58:08,467
What?

1716
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:10,425
Love has gone beyond
redemption stage

1717
01:58:10,467 --> 01:58:11,467
Chee...crap!

1718
01:58:11,633 --> 01:58:13,258
- I won't believe this
- Why not?

1719
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:14,550
Love and I are
poles apart

1720
01:58:14,592 --> 01:58:16,925
- That too fall for you?
- Most certainly

1721
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,342
What else can it be?

1722
01:58:18,383 --> 01:58:20,800
I live at new #12, old #16

1727
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:31,175
How is it possible?

1728
01:58:31,217 --> 01:58:32,758
How do you know my address?

1729
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:33,592
Aiyaiyo!

1730
01:58:33,633 --> 01:58:35,300
I'm basically a watch mechanic

1731
01:58:35,342 --> 01:58:38,050
Forget that, generally speaking,
my general knowledge is high

1732
01:58:38,133 --> 01:58:40,050
How are you able to see me?

1733
01:58:40,092 --> 01:58:41,050
How?

1734
01:58:41,217 --> 01:58:42,175
Love...!

1735
01:58:42,258 --> 01:58:43,008
Love...?

1736
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:44,258
Yeah!

1737
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:45,758
Now where am I?

1738
01:58:46,675 --> 01:58:47,592
New #6

1739
01:58:47,633 --> 01:58:48,758
Old #16

Parry's Corner,
Chennai - 600001

1743
01:58:54,175 --> 01:58:55,467
And where are you!?

1744
01:58:55,550 --> 01:58:57,717

1747
01:59:00,758 --> 01:59:03,800
But you can see me
You can hear me

1748
01:59:03,842 --> 01:59:05,342
Gone beyond redemption

1749
01:59:05,758 --> 01:59:07,883
Symptom #2 confirmed

1750
01:59:07,925 --> 01:59:10,633
And now for symptom #3

1751
01:59:11,675 --> 01:59:12,717
- There's more?
- Yeah!

1752
01:59:12,758 --> 01:59:13,758
What is it?

1753
01:59:13,842 --> 01:59:16,550
Let's check if you have a desire
to get married immediately

1754
01:59:16,592 --> 01:59:17,967
I have no such desire

1755
01:59:18,008 --> 01:59:19,550
Never make decisions in haste

1756
01:59:19,592 --> 01:59:21,092
We share he same wavelength!

1757
01:59:21,133 --> 01:59:23,758
I don't like you loving me
without my permission!

1758
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:24,717
Okay, forget that

1759
01:59:24,758 --> 01:59:27,425
What has happened, has happened
Let's do the litmus test

1760
01:59:27,508 --> 01:59:28,967
What if...

1761
01:59:29,592 --> 01:59:32,925
...you are able to
see my mother?

1762
01:59:32,967 --> 01:59:35,133
It means you want to
become part of my family

1763
01:59:35,175 --> 01:59:37,842
And the desire to marry me
is overflowing from your heart

1764
01:59:37,883 --> 01:59:39,342
How can I see your mother?

1765
01:59:40,592 --> 01:59:43,008
Maybe...I guess I love you

1766
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:47,008
I can see you and hear your voice
when you are not even there

1767
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:48,925
But your mother
That's too much!

1768
01:59:49,008 --> 01:59:51,383
Wow! You are very sharp

1769
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:58,675
What if you can see my mother
through that window?

1770
01:59:59,052 --> 02:00:00,510
What if...?

1771
02:00:04,142 --> 02:00:05,392
Please

1772
02:00:11,783 --> 02:00:13,241
- What!?
- Oh God!

1773
02:00:15,870 --> 02:00:17,703
- I can really see her
- What crap!

1774
02:00:17,804 --> 02:00:20,345
You're dying to marry me
So you're lying glibly

1775
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:23,541
I swear on my mother
I can see your mother!

1776
02:00:23,566 --> 02:00:24,399
What?

1777
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:26,304
You really can?

1778
02:00:33,538 --> 02:00:34,663
Don't worry

1779
02:00:35,309 --> 02:00:36,309
One last test

1780
02:00:36,566 --> 02:00:38,316
For symptom #4

1781
02:00:38,454 --> 02:00:39,621
Another test?

1782
02:00:40,465 --> 02:00:42,382
This is the most
beautiful test of all

1783
02:00:43,061 --> 02:00:43,977
Alright, tell me

1784
02:00:45,171 --> 02:00:50,046
This test will tell us if you want to
have kids immediately after marriage!

1785
02:00:51,812 --> 02:00:52,895
How?

1786
02:00:53,322 --> 02:00:54,489
Where am I?

1787
02:00:55,772 --> 02:00:56,772

When I am there, and you are here...

1798
02:01:18,002 --> 02:01:19,627
...can I touch you?

1799
02:01:21,938 --> 02:01:22,980
You can't

1800
02:01:23,204 --> 02:01:25,038
What if you think
you can feel my touch?

1801
02:01:35,259 --> 02:01:36,259
Sathya?

1802
02:01:37,685 --> 02:01:39,768
Open the door

1803
02:01:39,793 --> 02:01:41,564
- What is it, ma?
- What are you doing?

1804
02:01:41,589 --> 02:01:42,673
Come downstairs

1805
02:01:42,853 --> 02:01:44,406
You go...I'll join you in a while

1806
02:01:44,743 --> 02:01:45,952
I'm really sick

1807
02:01:45,977 --> 02:01:47,852
- Call the doctor
- What happened?

1808
02:01:49,309 --> 02:01:50,767
Nothing wrong with you
Come down now

1809
02:01:50,792 --> 02:01:54,167

Marriage...babies!

1812
02:01:57,228 --> 02:01:58,357
What are you blabbering?

1813
02:01:58,775 --> 02:02:00,340
Is it contagious?

1814
02:02:00,848 --> 02:02:02,306
You need not worry

1815
02:02:03,241 --> 02:02:05,657
Just to be on the safe side
go back 5 steps

1816
02:02:06,062 --> 02:02:07,478
What if you get it?

1817
02:02:08,691 --> 02:02:10,483
I'll rest up
and then come down

1818
02:02:10,634 --> 02:02:11,455
Wait

1819
02:02:11,559 --> 02:02:13,486
You know who has come?
Your aunt!

1820
02:02:13,546 --> 02:02:14,629
Come, dear

1821
02:02:16,098 --> 02:02:17,556
Aiyaiyo!
What is this, ma?

1822
02:02:17,581 --> 02:02:20,291
- Ma, I need an ambulance!
- What happened to you?

1823
02:02:21,163 --> 02:02:22,212
 Sister-in-law?
This is-

1824
02:02:22,237 --> 02:02:23,822
Your niece, Sathya

1825
02:02:25,739 --> 02:02:26,906
You can also see her?

1826
02:02:27,954 --> 02:02:29,496
You've also got it now

1827
02:02:29,717 --> 02:02:31,634
Let us both go to the doctor

1828
02:02:31,659 --> 02:02:32,534
Be quiet!

1829
02:02:32,850 --> 02:02:35,033
We are all so glad she has
come back home after so long

1830
02:02:35,058 --> 02:02:36,291
Don't blabber like a lunatic

1831
02:02:36,522 --> 02:02:39,355
My niece has already
visited me in Chennai

1832
02:02:39,962 --> 02:02:41,408
But it was quite by accident

1833
02:02:41,464 --> 02:02:42,422
I can't believe this

1834
02:02:42,897 --> 02:02:45,647
I didn't even offer my niece
a cup of coffee!

1835
02:02:45,672 --> 02:02:47,297
Why are you staring blankly?

1836
02:02:47,835 --> 02:02:50,669
Mani will be so happy
to know you are here

1837
02:02:50,775 --> 02:02:52,572
Mani...Mani

1838
02:02:52,616 --> 02:02:53,574
Here he is

1839
02:02:53,804 --> 02:02:54,970
Mani, come here

1840
02:02:55,090 --> 02:02:55,882
Me?

1841
02:02:56,189 --> 02:02:57,549
- Come here
- Sure

1842
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:00,373
Yes, mathaji!?

1843
02:03:00,398 --> 02:03:01,648
How can I help you?

1844
02:03:01,673 --> 02:03:03,090
Look who's here

1845
02:03:04,777 --> 02:03:05,735
Who?

1846
02:03:06,141 --> 02:03:07,808
She came home, remember?

1847
02:03:07,833 --> 02:03:08,624
When?

1848
02:03:08,884 --> 02:03:10,822
I gave her my sari
for a function

1849
02:03:10,871 --> 02:03:12,658
I get a lot of customers

1850
02:03:13,002 --> 02:03:14,312
How will I remember?

1851
02:03:14,353 --> 02:03:16,478
Sorry, don't feel bad that
I don't remember you

1852
02:03:16,509 --> 02:03:17,728
Remember that sari

1853
02:03:17,762 --> 02:03:21,050
I bought in Saravana Stores
for your wife-to-be, pink one?

1854
02:03:21,075 --> 02:03:22,189
We gave it to her?

1855
02:03:22,214 --> 02:03:23,172
Yeah...yeah

1856
02:03:23,687 --> 02:03:24,369
What was it?

1857
02:03:24,394 --> 02:03:26,560
HMT
Model S76

1858
02:03:26,910 --> 02:03:28,618
Grandpa's favorite watch

1859
02:03:28,784 --> 02:03:32,181
Sorry, basically I'm a watch mechanic
I never remember a customer's face

1860
02:03:32,394 --> 02:03:33,794
I remember only the model of watch

1861
02:03:33,873 --> 02:03:35,581
I added the date device, right?

1862
02:03:35,606 --> 02:03:36,939
Is the watch working?

1863
02:03:37,382 --> 02:03:38,822
By the way, I'm Mani

1864
02:03:38,847 --> 02:03:40,347
Your cousin

1865
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:43,971
Yes, grandpa?

1866
02:03:45,035 --> 02:03:45,868
I'll be there

1867
02:03:46,066 --> 02:03:48,408
He's showing me some more photos
I'll be downstairs

1868
02:03:48,433 --> 02:03:51,516
 Can you lend me a hand
to place my box on the shelf?

1869
02:03:51,567 --> 02:03:52,484
That is not the done-

1870
02:03:52,509 --> 02:03:54,134
 A boy entering a girl's room?

1871
02:03:54,332 --> 02:03:55,916
How can a guest be asked to wor-

1872
02:03:55,941 --> 02:03:57,283
Just help her, son

1873
02:03:57,644 --> 02:03:59,477
Anni, I can't believe
this coincidence

1874
02:03:59,582 --> 02:04:01,332
Ma, I have a sore throat

1875
02:04:01,357 --> 02:04:02,357
Ma...!

1876
02:04:05,676 --> 02:04:06,801
How was that?

1877
02:04:07,051 --> 02:04:08,093
Symptom #1

1878
02:04:08,344 --> 02:04:10,511
2, 3, 4...!

1879
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:13,791
Do you know
symptom #5?

1880
02:04:13,816 --> 02:04:15,525
I wasn't taught this
in my school

1881
02:04:16,457 --> 02:04:17,707
Don't know?

1882
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:22,195
The patient suffering from this disease
is able to see the guy she's in love with

1883
02:04:22,321 --> 02:04:25,030
Do you know what
she will do to him?

1884
02:04:25,949 --> 02:04:27,508
Gorge his eyes

1885
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:29,187
Punch his nose

1886
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:32,437
Rip his ear apart
Break his hand

1887
02:04:33,663 --> 02:04:35,996
I think the imaginophilia
has left you for good

1888
02:04:36,021 --> 02:04:37,437
- HUH?
- Yeah!

1889
02:04:37,462 --> 02:04:40,545
We both are in
the Romansophilia mode

1890
02:05:11,079 --> 02:05:14,787
SONG TO BE FILLED@

1891
02:10:11,712 --> 02:10:15,972
In your happy moments of reunion

1892
02:10:15,997 --> 02:10:18,038
...as a close knit family

1893
02:10:18,409 --> 02:10:21,326
...I told you my story

1894
02:10:21,413 --> 02:10:23,035
And upset all of you

1895
02:10:23,060 --> 02:10:23,935
No...no

1896
02:10:24,223 --> 02:10:25,348
Not at all, sir

1897
02:10:25,373 --> 02:10:27,378
You just opened your heart to us

1898
02:10:27,403 --> 02:10:28,362
That's all, right?

1899
02:10:29,152 --> 02:10:33,944
All of us tremble with fear on hearing
your elder brother Athreya's name

1900
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:37,378
We feel so terrible
listening to your story

1901
02:10:37,403 --> 02:10:39,675
Imagine how you must be feeling
haivng experienced it

1902
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:41,635
He tried to kill his twin
for materialistic gains

1903
02:10:41,849 --> 02:10:43,057
And his twin's wife

1904
02:10:43,186 --> 02:10:47,370
Men like Athreya
should be tortured to death

1905
02:10:47,423 --> 02:10:50,132
He should have lived and
been traumatized every second

1906
02:10:50,157 --> 02:10:51,541
Died a million deaths-

1907
02:10:51,566 --> 02:10:52,608
Raghu

1908
02:10:52,962 --> 02:10:54,671
- Raghu
- Sorry, pa

1909
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:56,092
Sethuraman

1910
02:10:56,697 --> 02:10:59,947
How can we change
what has already happened?

1911
02:11:00,419 --> 02:11:03,978
All we can hope is
a better future

1912
02:11:05,668 --> 02:11:10,793
'For 26 years I was
vegetating in the same spot'

1913
02:11:11,603 --> 02:11:16,937
'I was wondering why
I came out of that state'

1914
02:11:18,212 --> 02:11:19,796
'My son'

1915
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:22,862
'You are the answer
standing before me'

1916
02:11:23,801 --> 02:11:27,801
I think I was holding
on to my last breath...

1917
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:32,946
...by the blind faith
I would see you again

1918
02:11:33,930 --> 02:11:34,847
Madam...?

1919
02:11:35,454 --> 02:11:38,204
I have no words to thank you

1920
02:11:39,356 --> 02:11:44,689
I just wanted to see
my son again one last time

1921
02:11:46,907 --> 02:11:48,782
That's why I'm here

1922
02:11:49,650 --> 02:11:51,692
I have seen him now
to my heart's content

1923
02:11:52,001 --> 02:11:53,710
I am at peace with myself

1924
02:11:53,972 --> 02:11:55,139
Be happy, son

1925
02:11:55,386 --> 02:11:56,553
I'll take leave now

1926
02:11:57,461 --> 02:11:58,586
I'll leave, sir

1927
02:11:58,611 --> 02:11:59,569
- Mithra
- Sir

1928
02:11:59,594 --> 02:12:00,510
Let's go

1929
02:12:01,202 --> 02:12:02,410
Goodbye

1930
02:12:02,646 --> 02:12:04,312
What is this, Sethuraman?

1931
02:12:05,444 --> 02:12:07,819
You can't leave when you have
just come into our lives

1932
02:12:07,844 --> 02:12:09,928
My daughter has come back
after so many years

1933
02:12:09,953 --> 02:12:11,412
My grandson is here!

1934
02:12:11,437 --> 02:12:14,136
The pain of being separated
from your own child

1935
02:12:14,161 --> 02:12:16,953
As a father, I know it
only too well

1936
02:12:17,267 --> 02:12:18,267
My father is right

1937
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:21,777
Won't your son want to
spend a few days with you?

1938
02:12:21,976 --> 02:12:23,684
Listen to me, Sethuraman

1939
02:12:23,947 --> 02:12:26,781
Don't forget you are
also part of this family

1940
02:12:26,806 --> 02:12:27,681
Mani

1941
02:12:27,706 --> 02:12:28,748
Take your father inside

1942
02:12:28,773 --> 02:12:30,357
- Alright
- This is your house

1943
02:12:31,027 --> 02:12:32,360
Come in, Sethuraman

1944
02:12:41,582 --> 02:12:42,915
Forgive us for
disturbing you

1945
02:12:43,012 --> 02:12:45,714
We didn't expect a tree would fall
and destroy the school building

1946
02:12:45,739 --> 02:12:47,739
We need to rebuild
as soon as possible, sir

1947
02:12:47,764 --> 02:12:49,430
What you say is right

1948
02:12:49,455 --> 02:12:50,330
I can't deny it

1949
02:12:50,440 --> 02:12:53,731
Varadarajan, father and I have
been discussing the issue

1950
02:12:53,887 --> 02:12:56,785
We don't know how we can get
this huge an amount all of a sud-

1951
02:12:56,883 --> 02:12:58,883
Please come in, Sethuraman

1952
02:12:59,027 --> 02:13:01,735
Small problem with our school
We are trying to resolve it

1953
02:13:02,004 --> 02:13:03,129
That's all

1954
02:13:04,241 --> 02:13:06,157
I heard everything

1955
02:13:07,941 --> 02:13:11,480
How much would you need
to rebuild the school?

1956
02:13:12,068 --> 02:13:13,925
Around 10 to 15

1957
02:13:13,950 --> 02:13:15,620
Around 15 million

1958
02:13:15,788 --> 02:13:17,038
No worries

1959
02:13:17,844 --> 02:13:19,511
Let it be my contribution

1960
02:13:19,937 --> 02:13:22,003
Please start the work
as soon as possible

1961
02:13:22,116 --> 02:13:24,199
Sethuraman
We cannot accept it

1962
02:13:24,542 --> 02:13:26,000
Why should you?

1963
02:13:26,025 --> 02:13:27,192
Why not?

1964
02:13:27,707 --> 02:13:29,332
It isn't my money

1965
02:13:29,832 --> 02:13:31,499
It is your grandson's money

1966
02:13:32,264 --> 02:13:33,597
Please accept it

1967
02:13:33,622 --> 02:13:35,497
Alright, as you please

1968
02:13:35,555 --> 02:13:36,430
Problem solved

1969
02:13:36,455 --> 02:13:37,872
- Happy now?
- Thank you, sir

1970
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:39,773
I'm speechless

1971
02:13:39,798 --> 02:13:40,839
15 million

1972
02:13:41,578 --> 02:13:43,661
Such a boon to
our school kids

1973
02:13:43,686 --> 02:13:45,227
Thank you so much, uncle

1974
02:13:45,930 --> 02:13:47,347
- Sathya
- Uncle?

1975
02:13:47,406 --> 02:13:50,281
Open that briefcase and
give me the check book

1976
02:13:59,658 --> 02:14:01,492
I'll give it to grandpa
and be right back

1977
02:14:11,946 --> 02:14:12,863
Sathya

1978
02:14:13,442 --> 02:14:15,900
Give me the check

1979
02:14:16,129 --> 02:14:18,171
I think I've got
the date wrong

1980
02:14:22,261 --> 02:14:24,094
Give it to me

1981
02:14:25,475 --> 02:14:27,600
I have to check the amount

1982
02:14:29,929 --> 02:14:32,387
Everything is correct
Including your signature

1983
02:14:32,796 --> 02:14:34,379
Give me that cheque

1984
02:14:34,458 --> 02:14:35,824
You are Athreya

1985
02:14:35,933 --> 02:14:37,350
Give it to me

1986
02:14:37,431 --> 02:14:38,848
You destroyed that family

1987
02:14:39,187 --> 02:14:42,270
Give it to me

1988
02:14:42,845 --> 02:14:43,804
Mani

1989
02:15:00,164 --> 02:15:01,205
Mani, open the door

1990
02:15:08,194 --> 02:15:09,569
Father

1991
02:15:22,676 --> 02:15:23,676
Father!

1992
02:15:24,665 --> 02:15:25,415
Pa...?

1993
02:15:27,514 --> 02:15:30,264
Father, you'll be fine

1994
02:15:34,936 --> 02:15:36,436
Just 1 minute

1995
02:16:02,306 --> 02:16:07,723
Sethu...raman

1996
02:16:08,751 --> 02:16:09,543
Hey

1997
02:16:10,866 --> 02:16:12,991
Your dad gave me
For the school fund

1998
02:16:14,348 --> 02:16:15,293
What is it, son?

1999
02:16:15,318 --> 02:16:17,985
I just came to see
if you wanted to go down

2000
02:16:18,212 --> 02:16:19,879
I could take you

2001
02:16:37,069 --> 02:16:38,347
What is it, uncle?

2002
02:16:38,516 --> 02:16:39,850
Do you need anything?

2003
02:16:40,228 --> 02:16:41,562
Mani's room is over there

2004
02:16:41,603 --> 02:16:43,978
I came to meet you

2005
02:16:44,020 --> 02:16:44,808
What is it?

2006
02:16:44,833 --> 02:16:47,583
Mani is in love with you

2007
02:16:47,906 --> 02:16:49,948
His actions make it obvious

2008
02:16:50,050 --> 02:16:54,133
His life will be beautiful
if you share it with him

2009
02:16:54,910 --> 02:16:55,785
That's why

2010
02:16:56,227 --> 02:16:58,519
I came to ask you
how you feel about him

2011
02:16:59,309 --> 02:17:03,101
Shall I talk on your behalf
to the elders of the house?

2012
02:17:03,995 --> 02:17:05,537
Yes, please do

2013
02:17:06,391 --> 02:17:07,641
I'm very happy

2014
02:17:08,664 --> 02:17:09,956
You sleep now

2015
02:17:11,374 --> 02:17:13,499
- Good night, uncle
- Good night

2016
02:17:31,984 --> 02:17:33,025
Sir

2017
02:17:35,171 --> 02:17:36,129
Sir

2018
02:17:37,827 --> 02:17:40,118
Why are you out alone
at this time of night?

2019
02:17:40,246 --> 02:17:41,579
You could've called me

2020
02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:43,733
Let's go to your room, sir

2021
02:17:46,477 --> 02:17:48,477
What a performance, sir

2022
02:17:48,723 --> 02:17:51,848
Now way anyone in this house
will see through our plan

2023
02:17:52,203 --> 02:17:53,876
You fooled everyone completely

2024
02:17:55,748 --> 02:17:57,332
If I didn't know better...

2025
02:17:58,008 --> 02:18:00,353
...just like all these people
I would've also believed you

2026
02:18:00,464 --> 02:18:02,255
One can pretend to be sad

2027
02:18:02,848 --> 02:18:05,764
But harboring so much
sadness in your heart

2028
02:18:06,114 --> 02:18:08,697
How are you pretending
to be so happy, sir?

2029
02:18:09,137 --> 02:18:13,642
To know you may live
only for few more weeks

2030
02:18:13,707 --> 02:18:16,207
How are you able
to take it so easy?

2031
02:18:16,748 --> 02:18:18,957
Your son must know, sir

2032
02:18:20,861 --> 02:18:22,194
He is your son

2033
02:18:22,923 --> 02:18:25,090
A very talented watch mechanic

2034
02:18:26,084 --> 02:18:28,251
You only need to say the word!

2035
02:18:29,485 --> 02:18:30,902
He'll do it for you

2036
02:18:31,622 --> 02:18:34,997
He will do it to meet
the mother he never saw

2037
02:18:35,455 --> 02:18:39,413
He will finetune the watch
to go back 26 years

2038
02:18:41,514 --> 02:18:44,473
You won't tell anyone the truth

2039
02:18:45,311 --> 02:18:47,853
Neither will you let me do it

2040
02:18:47,926 --> 02:18:50,517
And you have decided to
leave this place tomorrow

2041
02:18:50,647 --> 02:18:51,897
Sorry, sir

2042
02:18:52,788 --> 02:18:57,205
I'm saying all this out of helplessness
at being unable to help you

2043
02:18:58,879 --> 02:19:00,462
Forgive me if I spoke
out of turn

2044
02:19:01,092 --> 02:19:02,384
Good night, Mithra

2045
02:19:02,762 --> 02:19:03,887
Alright, sir

2046
02:19:04,556 --> 02:19:05,598
Good night

2047
02:19:28,189 --> 02:19:31,564
Within 24 hours this watch
can travel anywhere

2048
02:19:31,747 --> 02:19:33,705
Why can't it travel
beyond 24 hours?

2049
02:19:37,314 --> 02:19:39,064
What must I do?

2050
02:19:42,623 --> 02:19:44,290
What's missing?

2051
02:20:47,046 --> 02:20:48,255
What is it, son?

2052
02:20:48,545 --> 02:20:49,379
Father

2053
02:20:50,671 --> 02:20:51,713
For you

2054
02:20:58,775 --> 02:20:59,942
For your sake

2055
02:21:02,936 --> 02:21:04,259
I have finetuned it

2056
02:21:08,548 --> 02:21:10,631
It will now suit your need

2057
02:21:14,817 --> 02:21:20,192
I have made a small change
to your extraordinary invention!

2058
02:21:24,358 --> 02:21:29,025
Your watch has a needle that adjusts
time within 24 hours only

2059
02:21:38,423 --> 02:21:42,090
But it has no date
to help it extend through days

2060
02:21:42,210 --> 02:21:45,002
I have only added that feature

2061
02:21:45,926 --> 02:21:50,092
Using this, you can
time travel across days

2062
02:21:50,647 --> 02:21:52,272
Time travel across months

2063
02:21:53,111 --> 02:21:56,111
Or even across years

2064
02:21:56,411 --> 02:21:57,952
For me?

2065
02:21:59,921 --> 02:22:01,171
Why, son?

2066
02:22:04,022 --> 02:22:05,314
Did I ask?

2067
02:22:05,927 --> 02:22:07,885
Whenever I look
at this watch...

2068
02:22:07,949 --> 02:22:10,615
I remember only how
I lost everything

2069
02:22:16,389 --> 02:22:17,264
But you have...

2070
02:22:18,569 --> 02:22:19,986
...for my sake

2071
02:22:22,559 --> 02:22:23,934
Give it to me

2072
02:22:30,005 --> 02:22:33,939
Father, like you wanted to
now you can go back 26 years

2073
02:22:33,964 --> 02:22:35,297
Father

2074
02:22:35,427 --> 02:22:40,886
Do you remember the date
and time you need to go to?

2075
02:22:47,967 --> 02:22:49,384
Father?

2076
02:22:49,642 --> 02:22:51,309
Athreya

2077
02:22:51,889 --> 02:22:53,790
I am Athreya

2078
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:57,212
You ask if I remember
the time and date?!

2079
02:22:57,848 --> 02:22:59,556
How could I ever forget?

2080
02:23:00,137 --> 02:23:03,650
13th January, 1990

2081
02:23:03,821 --> 02:23:05,321
It was 5:00 p.m

2082
02:23:06,230 --> 02:23:07,525
That was the day...

2083
02:23:07,598 --> 02:23:10,432
...I thought with this watch
I can play God

2084
02:23:10,536 --> 02:23:12,767
And ended up like a vegetable!

2085
02:23:12,792 --> 02:23:14,042
Sethuraman

2086
02:23:14,165 --> 02:23:17,124
That was the day
he died along with your mother

2087
02:23:17,359 --> 02:23:19,901
They were both killed

2088
02:23:19,987 --> 02:23:21,570
By ME...!

2089
02:23:22,489 --> 02:23:23,614
I'll leave now

2090
02:23:24,068 --> 02:23:25,235
Once again

2091
02:23:26,046 --> 02:23:29,171
To the same day
To the same time

2092
02:23:29,397 --> 02:23:31,314
The man who made me
end up like this

2093
02:23:31,339 --> 02:23:32,839
Your father

2094
02:23:33,013 --> 02:23:34,555
Your mother

2095
02:23:34,580 --> 02:23:35,538
Not forgetting you

2096
02:23:35,662 --> 02:23:38,204
I will kill all 3 of you

2097
02:23:39,694 --> 02:23:44,230
I will be the 1st person in this world
to kill the same man twice

2098
02:23:44,364 --> 02:23:46,155
I am indeed lucky

2099
02:23:47,908 --> 02:23:49,491
That's ME

2100
02:24:07,835 --> 02:24:09,419
HEY uncle!

2101
02:24:11,165 --> 02:24:13,082
I'm a watch mechanic

2102
02:24:14,052 --> 02:24:16,511
All this is child's play for me

2103
02:24:19,039 --> 02:24:21,184
If you are Sethuraman's elder brother...

2104
02:24:21,349 --> 02:24:23,474
...I am Sethuraman's son!

2105
02:24:24,513 --> 02:24:26,907
Even if you lied glibly

2106
02:24:26,932 --> 02:24:31,266
...I suspected foul play
when I saw my father's 6th finger

2107
02:24:33,129 --> 02:24:34,212
Didn't it occur to you?

2108
02:24:34,458 --> 02:24:35,821
One who fixes the watch

2109
02:24:35,846 --> 02:24:38,033
Won't he check
before giving it?

2110
02:24:38,148 --> 02:24:39,106
That's why

2111
02:24:39,392 --> 02:24:40,934
This is the second time

2112
02:24:40,983 --> 02:24:42,275
I'm living this day!

2113
02:24:45,023 --> 02:24:46,940
Athreya...!

2114
02:24:49,210 --> 02:24:52,267
Why do you think I gave you
that dummy watch?

2115
02:24:52,292 --> 02:24:54,958
Even I know I must
go back 26 years

2116
02:24:55,136 --> 02:24:58,677
But the date and the time

2117
02:24:59,473 --> 02:25:01,764
Only you are privy
to that information

2118
02:25:03,379 --> 02:25:04,626
Now I will travel to my past

2119
02:25:04,651 --> 02:25:06,609
For my mother and father

2120
02:25:07,087 --> 02:25:08,501
Not only for them

2121
02:25:09,434 --> 02:25:11,975
But for this mother
who raised me as well

2122
02:25:13,602 --> 02:25:14,769
Mithraaaa!

2123
02:26:20,111 --> 02:26:21,069
Mithra

2124
02:26:22,002 --> 02:26:24,085
Mithra

2125
02:26:24,754 --> 02:26:25,670
I owe it to you

2126
02:26:25,695 --> 02:26:28,362
I...I am...back

2127
02:26:28,506 --> 02:26:29,673
Mithra

2128
02:26:31,685 --> 02:26:36,102
Tell these men to find a tunnel at
the third bend and enter the house

2129
02:26:38,611 --> 02:26:40,778
Tell these men to cut
the electricity at the house

2130
02:26:43,192 --> 02:26:44,442
You come with me

2131
02:26:44,467 --> 02:26:45,551
Come

2132
02:27:17,246 --> 02:27:18,204
Watch

2133
02:27:24,251 --> 02:27:24,939
Sethu

2134
02:27:24,964 --> 02:27:26,173
'Where is our baby?'

2135
02:27:26,430 --> 02:27:27,389
Sethu

2136
02:27:27,454 --> 02:27:28,556
'Where is he?'

2137
02:27:28,581 --> 02:27:29,831
'He is in the secret room'

2138
02:27:30,849 --> 02:27:32,558
What are you looking for?

2139
02:27:32,854 --> 02:27:34,622
I was doing my experiment

2140
02:27:35,241 --> 02:27:35,962
The watch is missing

2141
02:27:35,987 --> 02:27:36,987
It must be here

2142
02:27:37,149 --> 02:27:37,982
Just 2 minutes

2143
02:27:38,134 --> 02:27:39,900
I'll feed him
and help you search

2144
02:27:39,925 --> 02:27:40,800
No

2145
02:27:41,114 --> 02:27:42,156
Where?

2146
02:27:42,483 --> 02:27:43,400
Sethu

2147
02:27:44,052 --> 02:27:45,332
The watch is on the baby's hand

2148
02:27:45,357 --> 02:27:46,566
And you're rummaging everywhere

2149
02:27:47,633 --> 02:27:48,799
Here you go

2150
02:27:49,337 --> 02:27:51,253
I've brought your milk for you

2151
02:27:52,444 --> 02:27:54,069
Are you hungry?

2152
02:27:54,267 --> 02:27:56,183
Are you hungry, baby?

2153
02:27:57,517 --> 02:27:58,475
Here

2154
02:28:02,136 --> 02:28:03,451
Look at your father

2155
02:28:03,612 --> 02:28:07,446
He fixed the watch on your hand
and is searching for it high and low

2156
02:28:08,024 --> 02:28:09,551
He's searching under the table

2157
02:28:09,576 --> 02:28:11,159
He's searching on
top of the table

2158
02:28:11,199 --> 02:28:12,407
Right, baby?

2159
02:28:13,005 --> 02:28:14,172
You agree?

2160
02:28:16,123 --> 02:28:18,081
Why are you staring at me?

2161
02:28:18,625 --> 02:28:20,708
I went away
only for 5 minutes

2162
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:23,513
In 5 minutes did you miss
your mother so much?

2163
02:28:24,763 --> 02:28:27,596
You missed me so soon

2164
02:28:30,790 --> 02:28:32,623
My pet you are!

2165
02:29:04,568 --> 02:29:05,651
Priya

2166
02:29:07,189 --> 02:29:08,519
The watch is working

2167
02:29:09,329 --> 02:29:10,495
I did it

2168
02:29:10,642 --> 02:29:11,850
I did it!

2169
02:29:12,857 --> 02:29:13,732
Priya

2170
02:29:14,526 --> 02:29:17,360
Congratulations
my sweet, sweet darling

2171
02:29:19,654 --> 02:29:25,821
Your son is the world's
first time traveler!

2172
02:29:26,005 --> 02:29:27,129
What are you saying?

2173
02:29:27,154 --> 02:29:30,321
He has come back
from the future

2174
02:29:30,370 --> 02:29:32,504
With memories
of 26 years

2175
02:29:32,594 --> 02:29:35,863
He has returned as our baby

2176
02:29:36,141 --> 02:29:37,676
Hello, little prince

2177
02:29:38,044 --> 02:29:39,294
Let me hold you

2178
02:29:39,776 --> 02:29:41,133
My moppet!

2179
02:29:48,206 --> 02:29:49,831
The watch is on his hand

2180
02:29:50,618 --> 02:29:52,493
That means he was the user

2181
02:29:53,498 --> 02:29:54,665
Yes, Priya

2182
02:29:55,384 --> 02:29:56,384
Look here

2183
02:29:56,486 --> 02:29:59,069
This date device was
not part of my design

2184
02:29:59,094 --> 02:30:00,344
He has added it

2185
02:30:02,794 --> 02:30:04,586
But why did he do that?

2186
02:30:05,423 --> 02:30:09,423
He has come back from 2016
to this specific day

2187
02:30:09,535 --> 02:30:10,702
What is the reason?

2188
02:30:10,776 --> 02:30:14,776
What if...he's trying
to tell us something?

2189
02:30:14,826 --> 02:30:19,201
If what you say is true and
he wanted to tell us something

2190
02:30:19,226 --> 02:30:21,309
...he would have chosen
a date he can talk

2191
02:30:21,736 --> 02:30:26,694
Perhaps when he is able
to talk, we were not alive?

2192
02:30:34,778 --> 02:30:36,195
Take this

2193
02:30:44,948 --> 02:30:46,073
Hey! Kalai

2194
02:30:46,223 --> 02:30:47,182
Lock the gate

2195
02:30:47,309 --> 02:30:48,112
Nobody should go out

2196
02:30:48,137 --> 02:30:49,595
Okay, sir
I'll take care

2197
02:30:55,799 --> 02:30:56,716
Mithra

2198
02:30:57,294 --> 02:30:58,502
Stay here

2199
02:30:58,559 --> 02:31:01,245
This time he should not
get the better of us

2200
02:31:01,777 --> 02:31:03,069
Okay, sir

2201
02:31:03,349 --> 02:31:05,641
Sethu

2202
02:31:07,676 --> 02:31:08,745
Hey!

2203
02:31:08,792 --> 02:31:10,501
Dear brother of mine!

2204
02:31:10,605 --> 02:31:11,939
My fountainhead

2205
02:31:11,964 --> 02:31:13,089
My fruit of knowledge

2206
02:31:13,114 --> 02:31:14,245
Where are you?

2207
02:31:14,445 --> 02:31:18,528
Once again, I wish you and me
a very happy birthday, Sethu

2208
02:31:30,712 --> 02:31:34,378
I've come back 26 years
just to see you again

2209
02:31:34,614 --> 02:31:40,042
I have come by experiencing
the power of your invention, Sethu

2210
02:31:40,151 --> 02:31:41,442
Hey!

2211
02:31:41,561 --> 02:31:43,144
Where are you?

2212
02:31:43,204 --> 02:31:46,204
You must have run away
and hidden, hearing my voice

2213
02:31:51,779 --> 02:31:53,904
Are you trying to
charge the watch?

2214
02:31:57,576 --> 02:31:58,576
You can't

2215
02:31:58,820 --> 02:32:01,820
I have come here after cutting
the electricity to this house

2216
02:32:06,407 --> 02:32:07,407
Sethu

2217
02:32:07,479 --> 02:32:08,813
My brother

2218
02:32:09,850 --> 02:32:13,059
My heart is dying to see you!

2219
02:32:13,201 --> 02:32:15,650
I'm longing to hug you tight

2220
02:32:15,675 --> 02:32:17,175
Kiss you

2221
02:32:17,423 --> 02:32:18,673
Take a knife in my hands

2222
02:32:18,698 --> 02:32:21,010
And stab you repeatedly

2223
02:32:21,035 --> 02:32:22,535
Until you bleed to death

2224
02:32:22,667 --> 02:32:23,709
Where are you?

2225
02:32:24,829 --> 02:32:25,870
SETHU

2226
02:32:39,264 --> 02:32:40,181
Sethu

2227
02:32:41,508 --> 02:32:42,883
I got a sudden brainwave

2228
02:32:45,216 --> 02:32:46,841
You are my younger brother

2229
02:32:48,119 --> 02:32:49,203
My blood

2230
02:32:50,943 --> 02:32:52,443
I only want that watch

2231
02:32:53,979 --> 02:32:54,979
Give it to me

2232
02:32:56,084 --> 02:33:00,542
And I will not harm you
or your wife and son

2233
02:33:01,470 --> 02:33:04,511
I'll just take it
and be on my way

2234
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:36,096
You believe anything I say?

2235
02:33:37,323 --> 02:33:39,115
Am I such a nice guy?

2236
02:33:40,610 --> 02:33:42,110
Where is your son?

2237
02:33:42,922 --> 02:33:44,005
Tell me

2238
02:33:48,151 --> 02:33:49,318
Where is he?

2239
02:33:51,063 --> 02:33:52,771
Where have you hidden him?

2240
02:33:52,796 --> 02:33:54,296
He's worse than I am

2241
02:33:57,886 --> 02:33:59,470
Where is he?

2242
02:33:59,740 --> 02:34:01,782
Let us go
Please

2243
02:34:01,994 --> 02:34:03,119
He's inside, right?

2244
02:34:03,416 --> 02:34:04,791
Don't hurt us

2245
02:34:24,495 --> 02:34:26,412
You must die, Sethu

2246
02:34:28,454 --> 02:34:31,204
There should be only 1 watch

2247
02:34:31,338 --> 02:34:33,088
And it must be mine!

2248
02:34:34,253 --> 02:34:35,462
No!

2249
02:34:35,487 --> 02:34:36,820
(baby crying)

2250
02:34:46,232 --> 02:34:47,190
Priya

2251
02:34:48,385 --> 02:34:49,385
No, please

2252
02:35:08,699 --> 02:35:10,158
Come here

2253
02:35:11,388 --> 02:35:12,513
Sethu

2254
02:35:13,831 --> 02:35:14,831
Priya, come

2255
02:35:16,523 --> 02:35:17,731
Mithra

2256
02:35:19,515 --> 02:35:20,765
Mithra, where are you?

2257
02:35:30,344 --> 02:35:31,385
Sethu

2258
02:35:33,789 --> 02:35:34,235
10

2259
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:35,677
What are you doing?

2260
02:35:36,672 --> 02:35:37,003
No!

2261
02:35:37,028 --> 02:35:37,819
9

2262
02:35:39,927 --> 02:35:40,628
8

2263
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:44,166
Mithra

2264
02:35:57,701 --> 02:35:58,701
4

2265
02:36:00,167 --> 02:36:01,120
3

2266
02:36:02,708 --> 02:36:03,583
2

2267
02:36:05,389 --> 02:36:06,525
1

2268
02:36:07,083 --> 02:36:09,500
Son, till now we heard
numbers in reverse

2269
02:36:09,603 --> 02:36:11,419
Now letters in reverse, okay?

2270
02:36:11,631 --> 02:36:12,245
Z

2271
02:36:24,471 --> 02:36:25,067
Priya

2272
02:36:25,092 --> 02:36:26,342
Both of you stay here

2273
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:27,594
For a little while

2274
02:36:27,619 --> 02:36:28,782
- Sethu!
- I will be fine

2275
02:36:28,807 --> 02:36:29,515
Trust me

2276
02:36:29,540 --> 02:36:31,415
I have to charge the watch
1 minute only

2277
02:36:31,659 --> 02:36:33,534
- Look, if I charge it
- Don't go, Sethu

2278
02:36:33,559 --> 02:36:34,761
I can fix everything
It is closeby

2279
02:36:35,006 --> 02:36:36,682
- Don't go
- I'll be fine

2280
02:36:36,707 --> 02:36:37,854
Where will you charge it?

2281
02:36:38,063 --> 02:36:39,315
Watchman's cabin will have electricity

2282
02:36:39,340 --> 02:36:40,257
Wait here

2283
02:36:55,873 --> 02:36:57,206
Athreya sir

2284
02:36:57,905 --> 02:36:58,697
Over here

2285
02:36:58,722 --> 02:36:59,389
Sir...!

2286
02:37:02,322 --> 02:37:04,156
I have him here for you

2287
02:37:10,477 --> 02:37:11,435
He's here, sir

2288
02:37:11,460 --> 02:37:15,210
Kalai, leaving you alive
this time was a good choice!

2289
02:37:17,032 --> 02:37:18,490
For the last time

2290
02:37:19,833 --> 02:37:21,409
May you live-

2291
02:38:53,877 --> 02:38:55,206
Athreya sir?

2292
02:39:05,803 --> 02:39:06,636
Hey...!

2293
02:39:07,313 --> 02:39:08,313
What is it?

2294
02:39:10,055 --> 02:39:11,096
Sethu

2295
02:39:12,228 --> 02:39:13,769
Let's not keep this watch!

2296
02:39:14,614 --> 02:39:16,072
We have gone through hell

2297
02:39:16,334 --> 02:39:16,917
Priya?

2298
02:39:17,014 --> 02:39:18,056
Throw it away

2299
02:39:20,669 --> 02:39:21,586
Please?

2300
02:39:23,677 --> 02:39:25,052
Please, Sethu

2301
02:40:10,150 --> 02:40:11,067
Sorry

2302
02:40:11,205 --> 02:40:12,510
May we sit here?

2303
02:40:12,535 --> 02:40:14,410
By all means
Please do

2304
02:40:14,766 --> 02:40:15,724
Come

2305
02:40:17,033 --> 02:40:18,307
Such a beautiful baby

2306
02:40:18,332 --> 02:40:19,429
What's his name?

2307
02:40:19,645 --> 02:40:20,437
Manikandan

2308
02:40:20,525 --> 02:40:21,609
We call him Mani

2309
02:40:21,690 --> 02:40:22,940
Mani darling!

2310
02:40:22,965 --> 02:40:24,066
Come here

2311
02:40:24,223 --> 02:40:25,057
Hey!

2312
02:40:25,665 --> 02:40:27,415
He is coming to me
so willingly

2313
02:40:28,268 --> 02:40:29,464
What is it, baby?

2314
02:40:29,489 --> 02:40:31,072
Do you know me?

2315
02:40:31,927 --> 02:40:33,677
Where are you going?

2316
02:40:36,243 --> 02:40:37,659
To start a new life

2317
02:40:37,813 --> 02:40:38,604
Really?

2318
02:40:38,832 --> 02:40:39,923
Just like me!

2319
02:40:40,096 --> 02:40:42,110
My father has finalized my wedding

2320
02:40:42,174 --> 02:40:43,716
- Is that so?
 - Congrats!

2321
02:40:43,741 --> 02:40:44,616
Thank you

2322
02:40:45,532 --> 02:40:46,698
What happened?

2323
02:40:47,496 --> 02:40:48,246
Nothing serious

2324
02:40:48,271 --> 02:40:49,479
On the way

2325
02:40:49,504 --> 02:40:51,212
What work do you do?

2326
02:40:51,322 --> 02:40:53,281
I'm basically a-

2327
02:40:54,182 --> 02:40:54,979
Scien-

2328
02:40:55,004 --> 02:40:56,171
Science teacher?

2329
02:40:57,438 --> 02:40:58,188
Yes

2330
02:40:58,213 --> 02:41:00,424
My father has just started
a school in our village

2331
02:41:00,469 --> 02:41:02,592
He's looking out for
a good science teacher

2332
02:41:03,024 --> 02:41:04,816
Why don't you
 take up that post?

2333
02:41:05,534 --> 02:41:07,576
You said you were
starting a new life

2334
02:41:07,799 --> 02:41:09,948
Why not start that life
in our Gopalasamudram?

2335
02:41:09,973 --> 02:41:11,223
Gopalasamudram

2336
02:41:11,368 --> 02:41:12,326
Yes

2337
02:41:14,166 --> 02:41:15,260
What do you think, son?

2338
02:41:15,285 --> 02:41:16,548
Gopalasamudram

2339
02:41:16,783 --> 02:41:17,824
Shall we go?

2340
02:41:20,304 --> 02:41:21,471
Will you come?

2341
02:41:21,496 --> 02:41:23,038
Will you come with me?

2342
02:41:24,338 --> 02:41:26,047
He says he'll come

2343
02:41:41,180 --> 02:41:42,180
Mani

2344
02:41:42,502 --> 02:41:43,586
Mani darling!

2345
02:41:45,283 --> 02:41:46,533
Mani dearest

2346
02:41:46,689 --> 02:41:48,022
Where are you, son?

2347
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:49,611
Where has he gone?

2348
02:41:49,878 --> 02:41:51,086
Where else?

2349
02:41:51,228 --> 02:41:54,879
As usual, wherever Sathya is,
 he'll be playing with her

2350
02:41:55,147 --> 02:41:56,980
Let them play for a while, Priya

2351
02:41:57,005 --> 02:42:00,456
He keeps calling you 'mathaji'
 And flatters you all the time

2352
02:42:00,922 --> 02:42:02,995
And while you melt
he gets away with everything

2353
02:42:03,020 --> 02:42:04,645
You pamper him way too much

2354
02:42:04,709 --> 02:42:06,667
Now look, Sathyabama

2355
02:42:07,943 --> 02:42:08,940
At such a young age...

2356
02:42:08,965 --> 02:42:11,526
...you should not get
Imaginoromansophilia!

2357
02:42:12,310 --> 02:42:16,477
Among girls of your age group,
this is a very popular disease

2358
02:42:16,745 --> 02:42:18,550
If you look at a Barbie doll
you'll see only me!

2359
02:42:18,607 --> 02:42:20,774
When you see Tom & Jerry,
you will see only me

2360
02:42:20,830 --> 02:42:23,354
When you read a Tinkle comic,
even there you'll see only me!

2361
02:42:23,379 --> 02:42:26,879
I will finish my studies and
become a famous watch mechanic

2362
02:42:27,149 --> 02:42:29,815
You are loving me
without my permission

2363
02:42:29,954 --> 02:42:31,954
I don't like it one bit

2364
02:42:32,166 --> 02:42:36,166
If you want fall in love with me
talk to my mom and mathaji

2365
02:42:36,935 --> 02:42:39,227
I will marry the girl
both of them choose for me

2366
02:42:39,436 --> 02:42:41,394
Because I'm a watch mechanic

2367
02:42:43,413 --> 02:42:44,913
Shhhhhhh!

2368
02:42:47,690 --> 02:42:48,440
Stop crying!

2369
02:42:48,589 --> 02:42:49,547
Stop crying
