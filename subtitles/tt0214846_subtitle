3
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,490
The monsoon is all around

4
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,930
There are signs of merriment
in the eyes of budding flowers

5
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:10,096
Let's get lost in the embrace of...

6
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Dear friend let's go to the land where...

7
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,400
the ambience of these dark clouds

8
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,250
bees don't die over flowers

9
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,850
Why should one go where...

10
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,630
one is deprived of getting acquainted
with the mysteries of love?

11
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,550
What do you know about love?

12
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,470
Don't play with fire...

13
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,440
oh you beauty-crazed men

14
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,260
Your face is smudged.

15
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,010
Could you oblige?

16
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,480
You fell in spite of a long
beard (experienced)? Shame!

17
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a beard, not a brake.

18
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,270
Kamal. Speak. What's the matter?

19
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,470
Let me get out.

20
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,900
Come here.

21
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,900
Say something.

22
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,120
Help!

23
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,250
Get me out! Get me out!

24
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,980
Anyone here to help me?

25
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,280
Oh. You're back? Where did you go?

26
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,890
Why mataji (mother)? What
happened to your finger?

27
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,710
Why should you be concerned?

28
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,640
Softly. Why are you getting angry?

29
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,670
First ask her why she went out.

30
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,600
Look at her clothes.

31
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,820
I didn't go alone.

32
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,690
Father, all the class girls
went on a Diwali picnic.

33
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,906
Is Diwali celebrated outside or at home?

34
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,840
There he seeks excuses...

35
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,830
while you wander around outside.

36
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,080
Who'll get the things for Diwali?

37
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,400
You've been out shopping all morning.

38
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,130
Yes, but not to buy stuff for Diwali.

39
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,550
I went to buy things for myself.

40
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,470
What a heated argument?

41
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,990
Is all well?

42
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,160
Diwali sweets.

43
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,650
Diwali has returned

44
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,410
Our hearts are alight

45
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,180
Let's light each other's lamps with stars

46
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:13,450
They'll twinkle and disperse
the darkness in this world

47
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,750
Rubbing its eyes, the
brightness has awakened

48
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,580
Wait friend, let's go to nand (Krishna's)
village with a garland of our feelings

49
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,930
Let's exchange our inner
darkness for brightness

50
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's go to the banks of river Jamuna...

51
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,840
and find happiness in our lives

52
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,520
Diwali has come again, dear friend

53
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,770
Father's home. Hide. Quickly.

54
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,940
What were you doing, beti?
It took so long to open the door.

55
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,660
I was playing, father.

56
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,920
So, you were playing?

57
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,190
That's why things are scattered all around.

58
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,520
But who were you playing with?

59
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,740
I was alone, father.

60
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,980
So you did this all alone?

61
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,910
Father, don't get annoyed on Diwali.

62
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,730
Come in...

63
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,590
and give me sweets from this basket.

64
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,110
Not from the small basket...

65
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,730
but from the bigger one.

66
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,300
Two are hiding here.

67
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,750
Come out all of you, and come here.

68
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,990
You'll all get punished.

69
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,920
And you, Asha, more than others.

70
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,160
- Give me too.
- I will. Just wait.

71
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,090
- Close your eyes.
- Here you are.

72
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,330
Father. Give me too.

73
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,160
You too? Here you are.

74
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,490
Fine. See you all later.

75
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,330
No lamp at the holy Basel plant?

76
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,920
I will, immediately, father.

77
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,040
- Wait. I'll get the lamp.
- Yes.

78
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,900
- Has Kamal not come home?
- Not yet, father.

79
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,930
What happened? Why are your clothes dirty?

80
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,260
Nothing father. I just fell off my bicycle.

81
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,740
Just fell off?!
What if you'd hurt yourself?

82
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,400
Kamal, from the day
I bought you that bicycle...

83
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,470
I've been on tenterhooks.
My son...

84
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,660
please understand...

85
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,540
you and Asha are the lights of my life.

86
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,290
If anything happens
to either of you...

87
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,790
I'll die a living death.

88
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,130
Father, everyone rides a bicycle.

89
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,360
But you are careless.

90
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,200
And it's Diwali. The streets are crowded.

91
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,620
There are cars, horse carriages, horses...

92
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,080
There's danger of accident.

93
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,420
Did you hear that? It's supporting me.

94
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,050
Please get him some snacks.

95
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,620
- Where are you going?
- Babuji wants sweets.

96
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,830
Carry on working.

97
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,370
- Madhuri.
- Coming mother.

98
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,030
- Mother what did you bring?
- None of your business.

99
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,880
I just asked.

100
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,600
Didn't you hear? He'd like some food.

101
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,570
Please send Makhan.

102
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,710
Is it a lot to ask?

103
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,140
These modern girls.

104
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,150
Completed business concerning Narayan Das.

105
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,940
Very profitable.

106
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,120
See, it's the...

107
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,230
result of my hard work.

108
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,720
So, celebrate Diwali.

109
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,730
Light a lot of lamps.

110
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,229
The light of our house is...

111
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,980
You shouldn't have.

112
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,909
Where's the servant?

113
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,050
- In mother's room.
- What're they doing there?

114
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,930
Sorting out the innumerable...

115
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,630
packages mother bought.

116
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,660
Oh. I forgot the flowers.
Please fetch them, beti.

117
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,930
Bicycle?! Again?

118
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,860
Just yesterday you fell off it.
Today you are off on it again.

119
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,480
Father, I won't fall off everyday.

120
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,220
No, my dear. Leave it here, and go by bus.

121
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,030
Okay.

122
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,070
You have it, beti?

123
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,880
Good girl.

124
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,510
- Namaste, father.
- Namaste.

125
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,250
He's never late.

126
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,770
- I'm fed up.
- Same here.

127
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,890
I don't eat to get here in time.

128
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,290
Here's your watch.

129
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,250
- Is it working now?
- Yes.

130
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,430
It's a gift from the bank for
my honesty and hard work.

131
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,600
See? Even the clock's testifying.

132
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,630
It's possible...

133
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,660
the bank might give you one too...

134
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,800
- leading to improved prospects.
- Yes, perhaps.

135
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,800
Of course, why not!

136
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Ramdas!

137
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,670
Did you check these entries carefully?

138
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,740
- Yes, I did.
- You're lying.

139
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,010
Check again.

140
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,870
Rs 14 are missing.

141
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,700
Speak.

142
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,440
I was going to tell you...

143
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,320
- but didn't have the courage.
- What?

144
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,250
What urgency...

145
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,760
forced you to be dishonest?

146
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,340
My son was ill...

147
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,290
I needed money for the medicine.

148
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,960
You should have told me.

149
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,010
People have deposited
their money for security...

150
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,870
not to fulfill your needs.

151
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,400
You get paid for your work.

152
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,120
To fulfill your needs...

153
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,450
it's dishonest to spend others' money.

154
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,140
Do you know the result?

155
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,380
Prison.

156
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,670
Getting imprisoned even once...

157
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,450
would destroy yours and your family's life.

158
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,450
Forgive me.

159
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,640
Now he wants forgiveness. Get lost.

160
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,670
Why was your child unwell?

161
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,870
He had pneumonia.

162
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,510
Take.

163
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,340
Balance the accounts.

164
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Come on.

165
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,920
See that it doesn't happen again.

166
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,440
- Manager sahab is calling you.
- Okay, I'm coming.

167
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,420
- Model Town.
- I don't have change.

168
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,270
So?

169
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,010
What can I do?

170
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,180
Please sit. I'll pay.

171
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,510
- Is it 3 annas for Model Town?
- Yes.

172
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,650
Here. Give her the ticket.

173
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
And change?

174
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,790
We'll try when the bus stops.

175
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,620
I'll take back mine, and you take yours.

176
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,350
Shaadi Lalji, you'll have
to go to Bombay tonight...

177
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,920
to fetch some important papers...

178
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,790
from The City Bank Ltd. Bombay.

179
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,180
- I?
- Yes. I can't trust anyone else.

180
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,890
And...

181
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,830
- these papers too.
- Whatever you say.

182
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,730
I trust you completely.

183
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,360
But you need to be extra cautious here..

184
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,340
God willing it will be so. Don't worry.

185
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,480
- So get ready to go.
- Alright.

186
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,130
- What would you like?
- Some chest expanders.

187
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,810
Jamnadas please bring some.

188
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,370
Anything else?

189
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,510
- A shaving kit.
- Very well.

190
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,650
Did you come to get change or for shopping?

191
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,980
Unless we buy something,
they won't give change.

192
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,610
Here.

193
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,540
Do you want a single or a double?

194
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,940
Is single better, or...

195
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,790
double?

196
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,340
I think double is always
superior to single.

197
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,160
- Don't waste my time?
- Why don't you look around?

198
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,130
Excuse me. I don't need anything.

199
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,630
- Perhaps she's a bit annoyed.
- A bit? She's very annoyed.

200
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,370
It is justified.

201
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,420
You started shopping
without asking her wish.

202
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,250
The world is theirs now, sahab.

203
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,170
Are you doing business or mocking people?

204
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,910
Please forgive me for my bad joke.

205
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,340
Settle your quarrel among yourselves.

206
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,570
Please hurry up.

207
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,300
How much is this?

208
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,490
This costs...

209
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,500
2 Rupees 12 annas.

210
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,760
And this?

211
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
9 Rupees 8 anna.

212
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,810
Please pack both.

213
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,590
Check this new set of Cutex.

214
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,240
It has every thing
that fashionable nails need.

215
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,250
It's just come.

216
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,320
- How much?
- Only 5 Rupees 8 annas.

217
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,950
- Please pack it.
- Very well.

218
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,780
And... do you have Kestos?

219
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,510
- Yes. - How much?
- 27 Rupees a dozen.

220
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,250
Pack a dozen.

221
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,890
- Here you are.
- And my packet?

222
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,720
It's for the same house, no?

223
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,950
Same house? Pack my things separately.

224
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,960
Whatever you say.

225
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,210
Here's the money I owe you.

226
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,950
- No no, it's okay. I owe you Rs. 10.
- Enough, enough.

227
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,250
Here you are.

228
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,960
When do we meet again?

229
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,420
Why? How does it matter?

230
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,540
Okay, I'll come on my own.

231
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,700
Beta, what's in the bundle?

232
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,130
Shhhhh. Softly.

233
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,460
Or else mother will hear you.

234
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,820
Why? You haven't stolen from her.

235
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,740
It's not about stealing.

236
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,870
I've bought such a wonderful thing...

237
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,870
that if she sees it...

238
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,870
she'll snatch it away immediately.

239
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,640
You won't get another
in any shop in the bazaar.

240
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,640
All sold out.

241
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,590
Father, bhaiya won't show what he's bought.

242
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,540
Look here Kamal. This won't do.

243
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,760
Show us what you've bought.

244
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,760
And my daughter too.

245
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,010
Okay, father.
There's a shaving kit...

246
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,060
and a chest expander for exercise.

247
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,160
So this is that expander thing...

248
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,080
one uses to expand ones chest.

249
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,070
Please roll my holdall.
I'm going to Bombay.

250
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,070
You're going to Bombay?

251
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,010
Yes. Today.

252
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:43,250
But please stop this business of
exercising, while I'm away.

253
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,350
Look after home.

254
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,100
Beti, what's this?

255
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,450
My packet got exchanged.

256
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,880
Nanhi, I don't feel like leaving you.

257
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,700
But it's the question of my job.

258
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,150
Father, your holdall is ready.

259
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,970
Yes? Okay, I'm ready too.

260
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,830
Don't forget my books father.

261
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,060
How can I?

262
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,790
I'll write it down.

263
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,220
And yes, you must also remember...

264
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,240
as soon as your results are out...

265
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,760
send me a telegram immediately.

266
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,600
What will you bring for me, father?

267
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,720
- Whatever you want.
- For me...

268
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,400
bring bangles for me.

269
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,870
And for the size...

270
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,490
I should take you along, shouldn't I?

271
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,510
You never take me with you, father.

272
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,750
Here's a bangle for size.

273
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,440
Father, Bombay is so big...

274
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,780
I'm afraid you might get lost.

275
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,690
I'm not a child like you to get lost.

276
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,720
Put the luggage on the horse carriage.

277
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,840
Beti, don't worry.

278
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,070
I'll be back soon.

279
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,920
Water this Tulsi every morning.

280
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,450
It was planted by your mother.

281
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,690
Poor thing. She looked after it diligently.

282
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,020
Okay, father. I'll look after it well.

283
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:53,789
Oh, I'm badly hurt.

284
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,580
Are you injured?

285
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,750
Get up, I'll take you home.

286
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,170
I'm so grateful.

287
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,090
- Please be seated
- I'd like to take leave now.

288
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:33,630
You must have something. I'll be back.

289
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,410
- What's this?
- Did you fall somewhere?

290
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,240
Doctor (ayurvedic),
today was nearly the end.

291
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,360
A young man barely saved my life.

292
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,660
- How did you come here?
- I?

293
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,580
To see you.

294
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,320
I didn't invite you to see me.

295
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,940
But I said I'd come.

296
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,880
- Why?
- By mistake our packages...

297
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,870
got mixed up.

298
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,720
Here. And my packet?

299
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,120
I'll bring it tomorrow.

300
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,070
I don't want the packet. Just go.

301
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,230
- Please go.
- Is this the way to treat guests?

302
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,330
Whose guest? What are you saying?

303
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,530
Are you leaving or not?

304
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,780
Doctor, I won't go out anymore.

305
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,600
If you do, you're responsible.

306
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,310
There's still time. Leave.

307
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,430
Not before I've had tea.

308
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,530
- Who's the tea for?
- For babuji (gentleman).

309
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,810
Have you gone mad too.

310
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,100
Who asked you to bring tea for him?

311
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,390
I told him, beta.

312
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,020
Why father? What happened?

313
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,110
Beti, if he hadn't been there...

314
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,210
I would've been run over by a car.

315
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,100
Please sit.

316
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,730
He's Shaadi Lalji's. son.

317
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,630
Do you know him?

318
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,570
No, I don't.

319
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,570
I think I have...

320
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,470
seen you somewhere.

321
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,750
Father, are you hurt?

322
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,680
He saved me.

323
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,010
Mr. Kamal. Have your tea.

324
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,250
Madhuri, make tea for him.

325
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,940
He's shy.

326
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,080
So, you are in college.

327
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,520
Yes.

328
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,470
She's very intelligent.
She comes first in class.

329
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,330
Girls are doing very well these days.

330
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,860
In academics, in sports...

331
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,560
wherever you look...

332
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,730
She's an expert in cycling.

333
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,620
Is she fond of cycling?

334
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,240
Be careful.

335
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,240
Don't crash into somebody.

336
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,980
Poor person might die.

337
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,190
He's right.

338
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,200
Her packet got exchanged with some fool's.

339
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,650
He took hers and she his.

340
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,150
A pampered and spoilt bud...

341
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,910
lived in a garden

342
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,240
There was talk of her youth...

343
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:14,330
among the stars in the blue sky

344
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,330
She was laughing and playing one day...

345
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,480
among the colorful flowers

346
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,150
She was swinging on a swing
of flowering branches

347
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:13,130
Just then the eyes of a bee met hers

348
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:30,110
The eyes spoke and shared many secrets

349
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:47,550
The bud smiled and bloomed into a flower.
Then the bee went near

350
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:11,420
And soon snatched away all the color,
beauty, and petals

351
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,100
Such a sweet voice.

352
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,420
She sings well.

353
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,820
It's the first time I've heard her sing.

354
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,780
She's better than the best singers.

355
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,450
Napoleon says...

356
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,960
the success of society and country...

357
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,440
depends on women.

358
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:41,780
If men sit at home and spin yarn...

359
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,810
women will have to progress.

360
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,150
You say such funny things, beta.

361
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,430
I'm longing to meet this Asha.

362
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,550
Radio singers belong to high society.

363
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,790
- They don't meet any and everyone.
- I will meet her.

364
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,730
Okay. Then...

365
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,950
- we'll meet there.
- What?

366
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,310
Okay, I'll take leave.
It's getting late.

367
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,350
Hello. New Cosmopolitan Hotel.

368
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,090
Who? Taravati?

369
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,120
Hold, please.

370
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,460
Room 13. Telephone.

371
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,590
- Welcome.
- Yes...

372
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,956
I'd like a very clean room.

373
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,980
All our rooms are very clean.

374
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,520
Your call.

375
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,670
So which is my room?

376
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:50,770
Take sahab to Room 14.

377
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,120
What? I... come?

378
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:01,970
- I don't want any water problems.
- No, you won't have any.

379
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:03,880
I'll be back soon.

380
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,740
What's the name of your play today?

381
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,740
Innocent victim.

382
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,400
Great.

383
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,640
He forgot his umbrella.

384
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,270
I'm going up...

385
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:37,270
I'll give it to him.

386
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,670
Hang it on 14.

387
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:04,320
Excuse me. Is this your umbrella?

388
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,050
Yes, it's mine.

389
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,050
I must have left it downstairs.

390
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,490
You didn't leave it. You forgot it.

391
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,330
- Oh. Was it any trouble?
- Yes.

392
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,250
It's very heavy.

393
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:38,100
What's the matter? ls the porter here?
Get in quickly.

394
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,340
Who called?

395
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,380
Have you been encouraging someone?

396
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,220
As long as there's the net
of beauty and youth...

397
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,050
it will catch some victim.

398
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,600
Tara? What's going on?

399
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,320
You weren't at the rehearsal's, either.

400
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,350
Rehearsal? What rehearsal?

401
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:10,380
Oh, lnnocent Victim's?

402
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,390
Innocent Victim.

403
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,266
Please order your meal.

404
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,700
May God bless you.

405
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,690
I'll order after my bath.

406
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,130
I'll wait here.

407
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,560
No, You go. I'll call you later.

408
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,500
- Okay, may God...
- Bless you. Now go.

409
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:05,240
Such food kills one's appetite.

410
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,580
Bhaiya, you talk as if...

411
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,300
we have 4/5 servants.

412
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:16,340
Get married to the girl in the
photo in your pocket.

413
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,870
She'll cook for you.

414
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:23,910
Oh Asha, I never told you.
I went to her house.

415
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,880
Oh! You've started visiting her?

416
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,300
You misunderstand.

417
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,000
There's a Lala Durgadas...

418
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,300
I saved from getting run over.

419
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,970
But what's that to do with Madhuri?

420
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,500
He's Madhuri's father.

421
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,810
He took me home.

422
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:53,420
Then you must have met Madhuri
and her mother.

423
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,490
- Are you engaged?
- Engaged?

424
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,120
She's in love with you.

425
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,450
She heard your song on the radio...

426
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,250
and wants to meet you.

427
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,250
You should have brought her.

428
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:10,100
Why should I? She'll come herself.

429
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,120
She said, I will...

430
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:14,530
meet Asha.

431
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:17,230
Is she coming?

432
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:18,980
She said so.

433
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,110
That's why I didn't tell her...

434
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,620
you're my sister.

435
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,140
Do you work in a bank?

436
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,780
I'm the treasurer of a bank in Lahore.

437
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,710
I've come here for an important job.

438
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,140
So, you're here for the first time.

439
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,780
But you, here...

440
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,910
Father's coming next week.

441
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,910
I'm waiting for him.

442
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,450
In this big city...

443
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,470
- you live alone?
- Yes, I do.

444
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,100
But, till father comes...

445
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,220
I'll visit you now and then,
for company.

446
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,140
You don't mind?

447
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,560
Err... Nooo...

448
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,660
no reason to mind.

449
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,300
And you are new here.

450
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,120
It won't be easy to find the bank.

451
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,040
- I'll come with you.
- No, no.

452
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,870
Don't trouble yourself.

453
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,870
I'll find it.

454
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:23,130
No trouble. I'll be happy to do it.

455
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:24,840
Thank you.

456
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,160
I'll take leave now.

457
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,770
I'll come again.

458
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:57,320
I'm no Goddess that
you come like a devotee.

459
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,450
But you have such a melodious voice.

460
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,970
Immediately after your song...

461
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,690
I wanted to meet you.

462
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,020
I've seen you somewhere.

463
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,940
Can't remember where.

464
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:15,570
Anyway, what can I do for you?

465
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:18,500
Please don't bother.

466
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,800
No trouble. I'll bring tea.

467
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,790
No, please sit.

468
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,360
Are you alone?

469
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:29,090
Father's gone to Bombay,
and brother to college.

470
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,910
I'll get tea, then we'll chat.

471
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,500
- You here too?
- Why do you get so nervous on seeing me?

472
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,430
Why are you pestering me?

473
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,950
Is it me, or...

474
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,570
you. I don't know.

475
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,890
It's difficult to get rid of you.
You're everywhere.

476
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:41,210
The Earth is round.
That's why we keep meeting.

477
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,150
Now leave without a word.

478
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,370
- Otherwise?
- Otherwise?

479
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,700
At home I had to call my servants.

480
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,220
Here I'll have to call the police.

481
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,740
That would be more humiliating.

482
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,230
- Who are you?
- I've come with her.

483
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,560
- Oh. Please sit.
- No, no.

484
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,190
- He didn't come with me.
- Don't worry.

485
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,720
Why are you harassing me in another's home.

486
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,150
It's your home too.

487
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,070
Now I'm your guest.

488
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,200
Now you can't push me out.

489
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,230
Look here Mr. Kamal.
You're always troubling me.

490
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,870
So you know my brother?

491
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,400
Now I get it bhaiya.

492
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:43,640
She's the Madhuri you talk about.

493
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,410
So you brother and sister
were laughing at me?

494
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,380
What've you been telling about me?

495
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:06,940
Have you seen? Here take this.

496
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:16,720
Bhaiya she's really pretty
and well mannered.

497
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:18,540
I'm going now.

498
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:21,040
No, I won't let you.

499
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:27,070
Why are you looking
at each other like this?

500
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,240
Please sit. Bhaiya...

501
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,040
you said...

502
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,370
she listens to you?

503
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,000
Ask her to sit down.

504
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,420
I'll get another cup.

505
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,600
You get annoyed easily.

506
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:06,140
When did I have this taken?

507
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,870
I fell that way by chance.

508
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,000
But such a chance is never repeated.

509
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,030
Anyway, you can't keep it.

510
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,030
What should I do?

511
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,330
I'll take it.

512
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,940
Okay, at least now
be seated and have tea.

513
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,830
The cursed darkness has left...

514
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:09,080
and cool moonlight has arrived

515
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,990
And in a moon-platter...

516
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:35,850
it has brought pearls of hope

517
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:53,590
The eye that cried tears...

518
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:15,030
in that eye laughs my beloved

519
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:29,730
The nights that were
devoid of all pleasure...

520
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:40,550
are like that no more

521
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,960
The cursed darkness has left...

522
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:52,870
and cool moonlight has arrived

523
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,060
My daughter's very happy today.

524
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,090
Yes, father. I'm very happy today.

525
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:34,530
- What is it, beti?
- The girl singing on the radio that day...

526
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:37,170
whose song you liked so much?

527
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:39,080
Do you know who she is?

528
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,590
No, I don't, but...

529
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,690
she sang very well.

530
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,340
If you like her singing so much...

531
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:52,170
- shall we call her here?
- Why'd she come here?

532
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,290
Do you know her?

533
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,730
I'm so happy because I've met her.

534
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,250
Do you know who she is?

535
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,670
Yes, who?

536
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,490
He who...

537
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,420
Mr. Kamal. He came the other day.

538
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:12,150
She's his younger sister.

539
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:13,950
Shaadi Lal's daughter?

540
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,250
A very sweet girl, father.

541
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,910
Did she welcome you?

542
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,950
Not just welcomed,
they really honored me.

543
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:27,070
They? There were others there?

544
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,100
You know her brother...

545
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,720
Mr. Kamal?

546
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,650
- He was there too.
- Mr. Kamal?

547
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:37,660
Sweet boy.

548
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:41,200
Even his father's a nice man.

549
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,420
I'm very happy to have met him.

550
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,040
Who?

551
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,760
That... Asha, father.

552
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:54,210
The photo-lady came here on her own.

553
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,210
What're you saying?

554
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:58,440
Nothing wrong.

555
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,960
Bhaiya, such an intelligent...

556
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:03,580
and pretty and clever girl.

557
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,920
Must be a graduate. She looks
better educated than you.

558
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,240
Who? Who are you talking about?

559
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,970
Oh, you innocent.

560
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,490
I'm talking about Madhuri.

561
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,840
- My bhabi (sis-in-law).
- Bhabi?

562
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:19,320
What bhabi?

563
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,950
But bhaiya, will she like our hut?

564
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:25,370
She'd want a modern mansion.

565
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:28,100
A luxurious one.

566
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,530
Who's asking her to come here.

567
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,860
Of course you don't like her at all.

568
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,690
That's why you accompanied her home.

569
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:42,020
- I'll write to father.
- What will you write?

570
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,650
Just this, that it's bhaiya's wedding...

571
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,660
come immediately.

572
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,690
Get me a bhabi, bhaiya

573
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,680
lndulge me, bhaiya

574
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:18,450
I'll get her a teeka (piece of jewelry
for the forehead) made out of sun

575
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,940
earrings with the moon...

576
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:31,390
embroider the stars on her blouse

577
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:37,580
Her beauty will be enhanced

578
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,900
I'll steal color from the flowers...

579
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:10,410
and the beauty of the buds...

580
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:19,080
to decorate...

581
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,680
and give good wishes

582
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:33,700
Get me a bhabi, bhaiya

583
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,100
- Have you finished work?
- Yes.

584
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,690
I'll take my leave now.

585
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:04,030
- You'll find your way back to the hotel?
- Yes, I will. Thanks.

586
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,950
- Okay. I'll come in the evening.
- In the evening?

587
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,270
- We'll go out.
- But listen...

588
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:12,100
I have something very
important this evening.

589
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,100
You can do it tomorrow.

590
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,850
- You be ready. - But...
- Yes, be ready.

591
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,170
But listen...

592
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,300
Your eyes are cups of wine

593
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:55,370
I won't speak with you

594
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:17,440
- Speak. - No.
- Speak. - No.

595
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:33,620
Leave the others, and talk to me,
remove your veil

596
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:39,610
I won't remove my veil or speak with you

597
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:00,630
I'll bring it.

598
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,510
Taravati phoned.

599
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:31,990
- She's coming.
- Now?

600
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:36,130
- You told her I'm here?
- Yes.

601
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,150
- May God bl...
- Stupid man...

602
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:42,480
may god bless you... may god bless you.

603
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,740
Listen. If Taravati comes...

604
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:49,950
tell her I'm at the bank.

605
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,560
- Understood?
- Yes.

606
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,340
May God bless you.

607
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:23,030
I'm on time.

608
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:26,000
Yes, yyyou... are on time.

609
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,570
I got delayed.

610
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:29,970
So took a taxi.

611
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,970
- Come on.
- But I have to go upstairs. - Come on.

612
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,900
Let's go.

613
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,330
- Innocent victim.
- May God...

614
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:49,190
bless you.

615
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,490
The eyes have a strange ritual

616
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:08,190
They shoot arrows, but
the eyes don't see them

617
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:26,860
They leave one pair and enter the other

618
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:37,060
From the eyes it settles in the heart

619
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:46,440
One arrow lights a fire...

620
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:55,920
the other puts the fire out...

621
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:01,570
whether it's day or night

622
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:28,510
Doesn't know the smile of buds,
nor consider the peace of the bees

623
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:41,960
Playfully it snatches away your mind...

624
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:49,770
like the pearl from its shell

625
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:56,620
The magic wind blows...

626
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:04,710
and snatches away the flame
from a weak lamp

627
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:29,450
They shoot arrows but
the eyes don't see them

628
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:44,760
What are you doing?

629
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:50,299
With one arrow...

630
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:54,460
light a fire.

631
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:11,780
- What's this?
- Another arrow puts the fire out.

632
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:33,150
Who's he?

633
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:37,200
Mr. Ramesh. My father's business partner.

634
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,630
He's so lucky.

635
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,250
How?

636
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:46,780
The one who can visit
Madhuri's home is lucky.

637
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,790
Don't be funny.

638
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:02,820
- But why are you nervous?
- Not really, but...

639
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:07,460
- he carries tales home.
- What will he tell?

640
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:12,900
He'll tell mother, masi (aunt) see...

641
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:16,740
Madhuri and a boy...

642
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,860
were chatting in a garden.

643
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:24,810
Masiji.

644
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,740
I hope I'm not left
dressed as a bridegroom...

645
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,740
while Kamal takes the bride.

646
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,740
What happened?

647
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,940
Take a look in the garden

648
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,470
She's flirting with Kamal.

649
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,176
But that's true. Aren't you with me, here?

650
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,200
He'll spice up this information.

651
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,650
What would that be?

652
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:56,380
He'll say...

653
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,380
Madhuri and...

654
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,980
Kamal...

655
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,830
You don't understand.

656
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,390
Why don't you explain?

657
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:12,010
Let it be.

658
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:18,490
Should I explain it to you?

659
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,100
I don't like this teasing.

660
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,150
Madhuri, the eyes speak
when the mouth doesn't.

661
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,350
What do they say?

662
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:31,880
You want to know?

663
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:34,280
You are in...

664
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:37,020
No, you won't understand.

665
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:41,060
You are going to be in disgrace.

666
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:43,060
- What happened?
- What happened?

667
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:47,410
Go and see.
She's sitting with Kamal in the garden.

668
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:49,260
So what?

669
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,410
Kamal is a good boy.

670
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,410
You are never serious.

671
01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:57,300
Speak frankly that you both think alike.

672
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,620
So what if I'm her step mother?
I think of her welfare.

673
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:02,620
Can I not speak?

674
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,970
I'm tired of your talk.

675
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,550
Please go now.

676
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,610
Why beta, what is it?

677
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:31,190
What did you ask me?

678
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,730
Has Mr. Kamal left?

679
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:40,260
He's gone.

680
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:48,630
Father, I want to tell you something.

681
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:52,070
Yes, speak beti.

682
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,000
You know Kamal, father...

683
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,230
I and Kamal...

684
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,260
Speak. Don't feel shy.

685
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:05,880
Nothing, father.

686
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:09,410
We were sitting in the garden.

687
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,140
Did something come up
in the conversation?

688
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,260
We talked a lot, father.

689
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:19,200
- And..
- So what was your reply?

690
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:25,450
I said... What reply, father?

691
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,010
Okay, okay. Tell me all about it.

692
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,230
Nothing father. He...

693
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,260
he... he thinks you're great.

694
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:49,150
Leave this beti. Put on another one.

695
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,980
No father. This is a nice flower.

696
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,630
I love the smell.

697
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:44,340
- Oh it's dark and...
- Be quiet. Someone will hear you.

698
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:49,380
Oh god. You...
What are you doing?

699
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,310
What're you doing?

700
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,990
First give me a little sharbat (a drink).

701
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:05,820
I knew, like death...

702
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:08,350
your aim is precise.

703
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,920
But why are you here at this time?

704
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,520
To help you.

705
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:32,810
But it's a case of hard work and no result.

706
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:41,250
So what, we'll share whatever it is.

707
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:44,780
But what's this?

708
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,160
Nothing.

709
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:52,410
Stay away.

710
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:09,580
Wait.

711
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:19,320
A woman wearing bangles
may be a threat to man...

712
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:22,030
but can't frighten him at gunpoint.

713
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,230
Don't play with death.

714
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:27,080
It seems, wealth...

715
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:28,770
has influenced your eyes and brain...

716
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,140
both.

717
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,380
Leave.

718
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,270
What have you done?

719
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:18,100
Open the door.

720
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:36,570
- Murder! Murder!
- In our hotel?

721
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:43,520
The accused, Mr. Kamal...

722
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:47,440
son of Lala Shadilal, treasurer...

723
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:50,220
has committed a serious crime...

724
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,300
is presented to the court.

725
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:55,660
The serious crime is...

726
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,360
he goes to meet the beautiful girl...

727
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,070
Madhuri, everyday.

728
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:02,250
Your honor, this is incorrect...

729
01:23:02,630 --> 01:23:04,790
- and a lie.
- Quiet. Don't interrupt.

730
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:08,090
Respected judge sahab, this Mr. Kamal...

731
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:11,030
the treasurer's son, etc. etc...

732
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:13,800
has been arrested because...

733
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,840
he didn't take his father's...

734
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,990
and also his compassionate...

735
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:19,990
very beloved, and...

736
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:21,480
sweet sister...

737
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:23,320
Asha devi's permission.

738
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,940
Respected judge, I request...

739
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,590
that Miss Asha devi doesn't have...

740
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:30,850
any compassion for her brother.

741
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,040
Who asked you to speak? Sit down.

742
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:38,830
Excuse me barrister sahab.

743
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:41,080
Very respectfully I request...

744
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,450
the permission to say...

745
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,580
- a few words.
- Okay.

746
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:47,240
You're allowed. Speak.

747
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:51,080
I request sincerely...

748
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,090
to take off these clothes.

749
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,180
They're on rent.

750
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,680
Where are you going, fake barrister sahab?

751
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:01,410
Come back, and leave the clothes here.

752
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,240
But listen, bhaiya.

753
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:11,520
Will you be able to argue
your case like this in court?

754
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:14,050
What do you think?

755
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,880
You can hardly speak in front of Madhuri.

756
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:19,860
- How'll you speak in court?
- I may not speak much...

757
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,250
but in court...

758
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:25,020
I'll rescue many innocent
people from death.

759
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,020
Really? My brother's become very talented.

760
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:37,070
- Whose letter?
- Father's.

761
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:39,550
- It's from Bombay.
- When will he return?

762
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:41,680
In a couple of days.

763
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,320
- What else has he written?
- He has asked...

764
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:50,210
- about the health.
- Whose health?

765
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:52,800
Madhuri's. Bhabhiji's.

766
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,540
Don't be crazy.

767
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,040
Father's written...

768
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:02,890
keep Asha entertained.

769
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,820
She shouldn't feel sad.

770
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:06,880
Is this how you entertain?

771
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:08,880
If you annoy me...

772
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:10,740
I'll go out.

773
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,210
To go out...

774
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:17,170
don't look for excuses.

775
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,220
Say clearly...

776
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,310
you want to see bhabi.

777
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:22,850
Nonsense.

778
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,730
I'll write to father.

779
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:28,020
You stay out a lot.

780
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:31,070
And I get lonely and sad at home.

781
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:34,450
Father will bring books for us.

782
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,520
And bangles for me.

783
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,480
Bangles for me

784
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:47,890
I'm going to get colorful bangles

785
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:04,570
They should look green like the...

786
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:09,610
monsoon vegetation

787
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,390
And yellow like...

788
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:21,010
the mustard flowers

789
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:29,370
They should glisten on my wrist
like the stars in the sky

790
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:34,700
Or like the glow worms
in the dark night...

791
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:42,070
swinging from branch to branch

792
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:54,520
I'm going to get colorful bangles

793
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:57,520
Bangles for me

794
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,140
Very good.

795
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:19,460
Is this Shadilal's house?

796
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:22,050
Yes, but...

797
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:23,960
he isn't here.

798
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:28,590
- What's the matter?
- I have a search warrant.

799
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:32,500
- A search warrant?
- What's that, bhaiya?

800
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,580
Nothing? You go inside.

801
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:42,800
Do you believe now?

802
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:45,760
It's very surprising.

803
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:49,170
Murder! That too of an actress!

804
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,670
Didn't expect this from Shadilalji.

805
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:57,260
It's the saints who
hide their colorful life.

806
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,970
Very cruel. The family...

807
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,400
- will be destroyed.
- That's what I'm saying.

808
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:04,870
The children will be effected.

809
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:09,940
What happened, Ramesh? No, sit down.

810
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:12,110
Nothing new.

811
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,940
Just that Kamal's father...

812
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:16,160
Shadilal...

813
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,820
murdered an actress in Bombay.

814
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:24,960
- Who said that?
- See this.

815
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:28,050
- It's impossible.
- Read it yourself.

816
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:39,790
Why would you believe?

817
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,800
- Very unfortunate.
- When the father is like this...

818
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,450
what about the son?

819
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,120
Do you still want Madhuri to marry...

820
01:29:58,230 --> 01:29:59,330
Kamal?

821
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:03,460
Whether you get her married to Kamal, or...

822
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:05,860
Whatever you wish.

823
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,860
I don't want to repeat.

824
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,910
I only came to tell you this.

825
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:14,660
Good you told us. We've been saved.

826
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:17,800
Imagine getting her
married to a murderer's son.

827
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:22,010
- We would've been destroyed.
- The world is very bad.

828
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:25,010
When people see her meeting Kamal...

829
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:26,730
what'll they say?

830
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,710
I understand, but what to do?

831
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:35,810
If you don't know, take help.

832
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:37,670
So, tell me.

833
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:39,760
Get Madhuri...

834
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,340
married to him. All problems solved.

835
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,120
What happened, bhaiya?

836
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:37,370
Now what?

837
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:34,140
Kamal, this is impossible.

838
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:40,330
This incident has destroyed all my hopes.

839
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:42,410
Don't lose hope, Kamal.

840
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:46,800
Your father's innocent.

841
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:50,640
He cannot be accused.

842
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,720
Don't cry Asha,

843
01:33:27,620 --> 01:33:29,380
The world accuses our father...

844
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:33,320
but we'll trust in God.

845
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:57,730
What the sorrow and sadness has colored...

846
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:02,520
it's the sad world's sad...

847
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:06,400
picture

848
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:15,950
That which you enjoyed
in your imagination...

849
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:26,910
it is perhaps the
interpretation of that dream

850
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:44,300
What should we do?

851
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:46,510
As long as...

852
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,160
you don't get her married,
even if it's Ramesh...

853
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:52,870
she'll remain like this.

854
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:56,390
I'll stop him from coming here.

855
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,570
You are right.

856
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:01,450
You're leaving me?

857
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,740
I'm protecting you from disgrace.

858
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,200
No...

859
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:15,070
you're taking away my happiness.

860
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:18,100
Your happiness is in...

861
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:22,990
marrying Ramesh...

862
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:25,450
and obeying your parents.

863
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:28,040
You want to hand me to Ramesh?

864
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,800
No.

865
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,290
But I don't want...

866
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:38,200
to marry you and have the
world pointing fingers at you.

867
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:42,240
I've heard you. You
aren't concerned about me.

868
01:35:43,150 --> 01:35:45,850
But you have to think
of your father's respect.

869
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:55,920
- Forget me.
- Kamal!

870
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:19,990
In spite of doing this
there's no patience...

871
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:28,280
the direction taken leads you far away

872
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:34,400
Years pass away

873
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:41,620
The eyes yearn

874
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:51,530
The memories are painful. Oh destiny

875
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:04,990
The eyes will feast on
the lanes of the land...

876
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:10,520
and bring him to his destination

877
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:22,750
But time! Those to
whom he gifted flowers...

878
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:33,510
are throwing stones at him

879
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:44,720
What happened, Asha?

880
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:47,650
Bhaiya, I'm feeling afraid.

881
01:37:48,510 --> 01:37:50,150
Don't worry. Please sleep.

882
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:56,370
What was this noise, bhaiya?

883
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:00,010
Some children were
tormenting a beggar.

884
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:03,960
Father used to say...

885
01:38:06,530 --> 01:38:08,440
the poor should be fed.

886
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:11,100
Feed him.

887
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:14,480
Alright. Go to sleep.

888
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Take, baba.

889
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:27,380
Who should one tell,
what all should one judge?

890
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:35,510
The colors the world shows one...

891
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:37,650
in time...

892
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:41,830
it rains blood

893
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:50,110
They then cry and wail over their destiny

894
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:03,340
From next Friday...

895
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:06,450
only 17 days are left.

896
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:08,850
Why the hurry, panditji (priest).

897
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,330
Look for a date in 4 or 5 months.

898
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,360
The right day.

899
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:14,690
Okay.

900
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:17,000
Madhuri must have felt very sad.

901
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:21,580
She hasn't come to
me for the last 4/5 days.

902
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:25,440
You have a heart of wax.
Whatever you did...

903
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:27,320
it was for her good.

904
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:29,320
- Understood?
- Oh, my foot!

905
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,690
Just a slight touch and you scream?

906
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:38,770
Here you are.

907
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,240
July, August...

908
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:43,290
6th September is a good day.

909
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:52,600
Your company has come from Bombay?

910
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:54,930
Yes, for a few days.

911
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,610
What new play have you brought for Lahore?

912
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,900
On the occasion of Diwali...

913
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:02,710
our best play...

914
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:04,250
Omar Khayyam.

915
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:09,210
Omar Khayyam, beautiful wine server...

916
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,220
and a glass of wine.

917
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,980
Yes, yes. Sahab...

918
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:16,540
come and visit us.

919
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:20,400
I will.

920
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:24,910
And... we'll have a chat.

921
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:38,800
The days for drinking are here.
Carry on drinking

922
01:41:39,410 --> 01:41:43,930
The days to live have come, live on

923
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:04,830
It has intoxication, drown in it

924
01:42:10,170 --> 01:42:16,370
It has color, and comfort

925
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:27,260
Don't feel shy, just carry on drinking

926
01:42:56,670 --> 01:43:01,580
It dwells in a house of glass

927
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:17,440
It suits every belief

928
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:28,540
So why delay? Carry on drinking

929
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:08,400
It will drive away from everyone...

930
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:13,020
and force you to live

931
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:25,430
Drink as much as you can

932
01:44:43,030 --> 01:44:46,200
And, how beautifully the role was enacted.

933
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:48,430
Sahab!

934
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:50,870
You haven't seen anything yet.

935
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:53,620
She has that charisma...

936
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,400
which leaves humans stunned.

937
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:58,760
Then why don't you...

938
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:01,270
show me that charisma.

939
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,430
My hands are tied because of lack of money.

940
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:10,410
I would've presented
it in high class Hindi...

941
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:13,130
and create sensation all over India.

942
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,400
I'm there to help with money.

943
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,240
How much do you want?

944
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:23,350
For the props...

945
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:25,260
a lot.

946
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:29,370
But I'll manage with Rs 2000.

947
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:32,130
That's all?
Only Rs 2000?

948
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:56,940
Today...

949
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
is Diwali?

950
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Then why...

951
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:08,140
didn't you tell me?

952
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:12,060
You're ill. What should I tell you?

953
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:13,790
No, bhaiya.

954
01:46:14,810 --> 01:46:17,000
We will also light lamps.

955
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,910
And on the holy basel...

956
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:23,560
it's necessary to light one.

957
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:25,980
Asha, stay in bed for now.

958
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:28,700
When you're well we'll celebrate.

959
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:34,390
- Get me some crackers.
- Okay, I'll bring some.

960
01:46:35,130 --> 01:46:36,890
But you mustn't get up.

961
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:42,330
Here there used to be
the light of happiness

962
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:50,550
Now there looms darkness...

963
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:56,440
and with time the destruction...

964
01:47:58,370 --> 01:48:04,690
of the wishes

965
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:11,050
While the lamp burns
the wounds of the heart

966
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:58,140
Asha, you got up to light the lamp?

967
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:01,980
Yes brother, but...

968
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:04,330
I couldn't light it.

969
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,610
- I fell down.
- Fell down?

970
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:11,320
But there's a lighted lamp there.

971
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:17,200
- You must've lighted it.
- Not I.

972
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,210
I've just returned.

973
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:24,620
Then... who... lifted me up?

974
01:50:27,020 --> 01:50:31,790
Who lifted you? No, no, Asha.

975
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:35,960
You imagined...
Here. Firecrackers.

976
01:50:44,410 --> 01:50:45,510
Here.

977
01:50:54,550 --> 01:51:00,740
Madhuri's letter, no?
May god make her my sis-in-law.

978
01:51:14,930 --> 01:51:18,720
- Brother, is everything okay?
- Hardly.

979
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:21,990
Madhuri's getting married.

980
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:24,080
With Ramesh.

981
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:30,610
But she loved you so much.

982
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:35,050
- What else?
- She writes...

983
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:37,630
'Save me from this wedding.'

984
01:51:38,690 --> 01:51:41,740
- Take her somewhere with me.
- She's right.

985
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:43,970
Why don't you?

986
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,870
Listen, Asha. You know...

987
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,140
to earn a good name...

988
01:51:55,650 --> 01:51:57,790
I'm working so hard. That's why.

989
01:51:58,690 --> 01:52:00,390
The stain of our father's crime...

990
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:02,270
has to be washed away.

991
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:05,090
And so we live in poverty...

992
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,130
to pay back money to the bank...

993
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:09,600
the theft of which is blamed on father.

994
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:13,270
Bhaiya, when did father do that?

995
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,920
- He's innocent.
- Innocent.

996
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:19,120
If he's innocent,
he should come forward...

997
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:21,370
and clear his name.

998
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,700
Asha, our father...

999
01:52:27,030 --> 01:52:28,440
destroyed our world of happiness.

1000
01:52:29,290 --> 01:52:31,770
Because of him I left Madhuri.

1001
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:34,610
And your engagement...

1002
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:36,640
is impossible in any decent family.

1003
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:44,040
Don't bother about me. Save Madhuri.

1004
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:48,920
- She must be very sad.
- How can I elope with her?

1005
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:51,420
Father became a murderer and a thief.

1006
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:53,520
Now his son too, a thief?

1007
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:55,640
Elope with a decent girl?

1008
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:58,600
What a family achievement!

1009
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:09,840
My son is speaking the truth, God.

1010
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:13,730
I'm innocent.

1011
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:16,560
Why don't I face the world...

1012
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:20,130
and give proof of my innocence?

1013
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:24,120
I'm a coward, God.

1014
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:27,260
I didn't trust you.

1015
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:31,490
Instead of facing the world...

1016
01:53:32,990 --> 01:53:35,480
and proving my innocence...

1017
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,290
I tried to hide.

1018
01:53:40,190 --> 01:53:43,250
I made my children's life unhappy.

1019
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:53,000
Tomorrow I'll go to the bank manager...

1020
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:57,530
and tell him I'm innocent.

1021
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:01,270
I've been framed.

1022
01:54:03,490 --> 01:54:06,910
God, forgive me.

1023
01:54:08,230 --> 01:54:09,630
And give me strength.

1024
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:17,790
Great. Are you worshipping?

1025
01:54:19,110 --> 01:54:21,510
You want to steal? Get lost!

1026
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:24,240
Run. You priest.

1027
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:43,660
Oh heart, cry softly

1028
01:54:48,070 --> 01:54:51,790
Don't lose the direction of your pining

1029
01:55:04,490 --> 01:55:10,350
Don't tell the world what is in your heart

1030
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:16,430
Whatever passes, tell your heart

1031
01:55:20,640 --> 01:55:24,270
The person dwelling there will hear...

1032
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:31,150
all the crying of the heart

1033
01:55:40,010 --> 01:55:43,730
The fear caused by the sorrow...

1034
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,740
of separation...

1035
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:03,420
will make you tell the world about it

1036
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:07,470
But in your path of any hope,
oh foolish one...

1037
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:14,310
don't sow any thorns

1038
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:22,880
Oh heart, cry softly

1039
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:44,150
- Namaste Lalaji.
- Namasteji.

1040
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:46,910
I'm not satisfied with your new treasurer.

1041
01:56:47,620 --> 01:56:49,120
Your old treasurer...

1042
01:56:49,290 --> 01:56:51,590
Lala Shadilalji was a good man.

1043
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,330
Oh yes, he was a very good man.

1044
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:58,540
That's why he put us in difficulty.

1045
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:03,700
Don't take his name. Please come in.

1046
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:17,610
- How long will it take?
- Only 10 minutes.

1047
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,070
What's the time?

1048
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:41,560
Satisfied?

1049
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:51,690
Do you lack clothes
that you're buying more?

1050
01:57:55,570 --> 01:57:59,120
Not for me.
For your beloved daughter's wedding.

1051
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:02,510
Sure! Sure! Buy! Tell him...

1052
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:05,000
- to get even better material.
- And you...

1053
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:08,420
phone Govind Ram Jauhri
about the jewelry.

1054
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:11,600
This saree was made in England.

1055
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:22,640
Seth sahab, you forgot your
promise to get me a saree.

1056
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:26,890
Saree? Not just sarees,
I'll get you...

1057
01:58:27,370 --> 01:58:29,300
cars, mansions...

1058
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:32,290
money and jewelry,
and other such things.

1059
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:35,650
For you I'm ready to have my head cut off.

1060
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:44,140
Come Prakash. What's the matter?

1061
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,390
Did you see this, Seth sahab?

1062
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:50,470
The manager has started cheating us too.

1063
01:58:53,150 --> 01:58:54,550
What check is this?

1064
01:58:55,650 --> 01:58:58,460
I've always tried to shield him...

1065
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:01,570
and this is what I get in return.

1066
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:05,280
- Bad check.
- Why are you complaining to me?

1067
01:59:06,090 --> 01:59:09,480
Speak to him. I've already paid him.

1068
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:13,480
No, I'm not saying anything to you.

1069
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:17,010
But just notice how cunning he is.

1070
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:22,590
When was he ever simple...

1071
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:24,600
to have become cunning now.

1072
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:27,600
Fraud and cheating is his job.

1073
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:31,430
But his cheating and fraud
won't work on me, Sethji.

1074
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:33,660
I'll ask him right now.

1075
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:51,530
Here's your check. It bounced.

1076
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:56,810
It's the first time you gave me my share.
That too with deceit?

1077
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:02,020
There's a limit to one's patience,
manager sahab.

1078
02:00:03,450 --> 02:00:06,690
Do you know the dangers
we have to face?

1079
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:10,350
When you're asked something...

1080
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:13,730
you give excuses.

1081
02:00:14,030 --> 02:00:17,110
Don't always give hope.

1082
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:22,120
You haven't paid anything
from Bombay to Lahore.

1083
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:28,050
- What did I get in this trip?
- I don't care...

1084
02:00:29,250 --> 02:00:31,360
but Ramesh's Rs 1500 check...

1085
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:33,850
will not be only yours.

1086
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:35,640
You forget Prakash...

1087
02:00:36,490 --> 02:00:38,280
I helped you when...

1088
02:00:39,020 --> 02:00:40,710
you were penniless.

1089
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:43,100
You forget, manager sahab...

1090
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:47,380
I know all your secrets.

1091
02:00:48,150 --> 02:00:49,580
If I tell them...

1092
02:00:50,270 --> 02:00:51,950
you'll be hung right now.

1093
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:53,280
Quiet!

1094
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,690
I won't!

1095
02:00:56,370 --> 02:00:57,980
I'll shout out...

1096
02:00:58,410 --> 02:01:00,640
you're a killer, a murderer.

1097
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:02,940
You're a dacoit.

1098
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:06,810
You killed Tara.
You robbed poor Khazanchi.

1099
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,160
And now...

1100
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:11,210
you're cheating Ramesh.

1101
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:37,000
- You've killed him?
- Yes.

1102
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:38,990
Anyone who messes with me...

1103
02:01:39,690 --> 02:01:41,140
deserves this.

1104
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:45,400
What have you done?
What will you do now?

1105
02:01:46,950 --> 02:01:48,070
You'll hang.

1106
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:51,870
Run away.

1107
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:58,610
And you'll escape unscathed?

1108
02:01:59,530 --> 02:02:02,810
I'll see who hangs. You or me?

1109
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:32,770
Who are you?
What're you doing here at this time?

1110
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:37,190
Phone the police.

1111
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:40,680
Tell them we've caught the murderer.
Understood?

1112
02:02:43,390 --> 02:02:44,790
What a brilliant idea.

1113
02:02:48,980 --> 02:02:50,640
See he doesn't run away.

1114
02:03:08,260 --> 02:03:10,580
Trilok. Here's another criminal.

1115
02:03:16,750 --> 02:03:20,060
Are you aware?
I'm known as Chattar Sen.

1116
02:03:22,040 --> 02:03:25,086
Yes, because of whom
the innocent treasurer becomes guilty.

1117
02:03:25,110 --> 02:03:27,110
Catch him Trilok.

1118
02:03:28,160 --> 02:03:30,210
It isn't easy to unearth my secrets.

1119
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:03,740
I heard a gunshot in the next room.

1120
02:04:04,220 --> 02:04:05,740
When I entered the room...

1121
02:04:06,620 --> 02:04:08,870
the murderer had killed my assistant...

1122
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:10,650
and was trying to run away.

1123
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:14,560
- Then?
- Without a thought of my safety...

1124
02:04:15,010 --> 02:04:18,040
we caught the murderer.
There was my assistant's corpse...

1125
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:19,930
and here, the killer.

1126
02:04:22,390 --> 02:04:24,410
Handcuff him.

1127
02:04:26,950 --> 02:04:29,310
Father would've been
happy with your success.

1128
02:04:29,630 --> 02:04:30,870
Certainly, Asha.

1129
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:34,340
But luck is not on our side.

1130
02:04:37,270 --> 02:04:38,840
Okay. Don't tire yourself.

1131
02:04:39,490 --> 02:04:40,730
You've just recovered.

1132
02:04:41,260 --> 02:04:42,860
You shouldn't have a relapse.

1133
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:44,380
Alright bhaiya.

1134
02:04:45,590 --> 02:04:47,720
I'll pray to holy basel...

1135
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:50,520
that you succeed in this case...

1136
02:04:50,690 --> 02:04:53,570
like you did in the earlier cases.

1137
02:05:04,970 --> 02:05:06,100
Your honor.

1138
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:08,790
My friend has...

1139
02:05:08,910 --> 02:05:11,180
declared this as strange...

1140
02:05:11,770 --> 02:05:13,620
that a hungry naked old man...

1141
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:16,430
takes out a revolver from his rags.

1142
02:05:17,450 --> 02:05:19,450
It's truly a strange thing...

1143
02:05:21,050 --> 02:05:23,050
This person who doesn't
have clothes to wear...

1144
02:05:23,490 --> 02:05:25,830
no food to eat...

1145
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:28,340
is supposed to possess a revolver.

1146
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:30,650
But don't forget...

1147
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:33,690
this man who possessed a revolver...

1148
02:05:34,120 --> 02:05:36,220
was actually arrested when...

1149
02:05:36,570 --> 02:05:38,280
the suspect's hands...

1150
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:41,910
were stealing a watch
from a man's pocket.

1151
02:05:42,650 --> 02:05:43,910
You see...

1152
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:46,240
he's a person...

1153
02:05:46,740 --> 02:05:48,550
who, to deceive the world...

1154
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,710
with his beard and his age...

1155
02:05:51,070 --> 02:05:53,120
hides a criminal's hard heart...

1156
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:55,900
and an evil soul.

1157
02:05:57,730 --> 02:05:59,810
Can you still not guess...

1158
02:06:00,340 --> 02:06:02,750
why he possessed a revolver?

1159
02:06:03,310 --> 02:06:05,130
Are you still doubtful?

1160
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:06,870
The watch thief...

1161
02:06:07,150 --> 02:06:09,390
might have stolen the watch earlier?

1162
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:12,190
If there was any chance of...

1163
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,090
his being even a bit honest...

1164
02:06:14,740 --> 02:06:16,200
if in his dark heart...

1165
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:18,580
there was any ray of decency...

1166
02:06:18,910 --> 02:06:21,480
then before pressing the trigger...

1167
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:23,470
his hands would have stopped...

1168
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:27,096
at the thought of taking the
victim's life. That his children...

1169
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:29,120
and dependents would become helpless...

1170
02:06:30,590 --> 02:06:32,890
because they depended on him.

1171
02:06:33,370 --> 02:06:36,120
But this hard, cruel...

1172
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:39,180
loser, never knew...

1173
02:06:39,350 --> 02:06:41,640
the responsibilities of a family.

1174
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:43,730
Within the four walls of the house...

1175
02:06:44,090 --> 02:06:46,120
there are lovely people, breathing.

1176
02:06:46,570 --> 02:06:48,120
He has no one...

1177
02:06:48,370 --> 02:06:49,860
no children...

1178
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:51,750
no love in his heart...

1179
02:06:51,930 --> 02:06:53,910
- no place for another's pain.
- No. no.

1180
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:55,720
Don't say that.

1181
02:07:27,290 --> 02:07:29,500
He's escaping! Catch him!

1182
02:08:05,330 --> 02:08:07,940
Are there any other witnesses?

1183
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:12,190
Your honor. Just one more.

1184
02:08:12,570 --> 02:08:15,280
Alright. Please, present him.

1185
02:08:19,290 --> 02:08:23,310
This is cruel. You're forcing me.
I have no connection with this.

1186
02:08:23,730 --> 02:08:25,340
- Why bring me here?
- Quiet!

1187
02:08:26,410 --> 02:08:27,950
Why'd you bring me here?

1188
02:08:32,930 --> 02:08:35,700
Your honor, this is Mr. Ramesh.

1189
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:38,930
He'd refused the summons.

1190
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:41,480
After that...

1191
02:08:41,730 --> 02:08:43,970
a warrant for his arrest was issued.

1192
02:08:46,660 --> 02:08:49,620
Repeat: 'ln the name of God...

1193
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:51,340
I promise to speak the truth.'

1194
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:54,820
In the name of God...

1195
02:08:55,550 --> 02:08:57,140
I promise to speak the truth.

1196
02:08:59,990 --> 02:09:03,640
Mr. Ramesh, do you recall
giving this check?

1197
02:09:05,770 --> 02:09:07,740
Yes, but...

1198
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,480
No, no. I didn't kill anyone.

1199
02:09:10,650 --> 02:09:12,080
I didn't.

1200
02:09:12,140 --> 02:09:14,220
I'm innocent.

1201
02:09:16,290 --> 02:09:17,490
He's guilty.

1202
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:19,940
There he is. He's guilty.

1203
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:22,420
He pulled the trigger.
Let me go.

1204
02:09:22,530 --> 02:09:24,420
Let me go. Arrest him.

1205
02:09:24,790 --> 02:09:26,790
- Let me go. I'm innocent.
- Silence!

1206
02:09:27,350 --> 02:09:28,800
Do you know the accused?

1207
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:35,150
- No.
- Did you ever see him before?

1208
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:38,700
- Speak up.
- No, I didn't.

1209
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:42,000
Nor when the crime took place?

1210
02:09:42,920 --> 02:09:44,020
No.

1211
02:09:45,610 --> 02:09:47,270
So your honor...

1212
02:09:47,730 --> 02:09:49,450
no more questions.

1213
02:09:56,040 --> 02:09:58,640
I want to ask a couple of questions.

1214
02:09:58,830 --> 02:10:00,960
Please do, but quickly.

1215
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:02,960
I have to attend my wedding.

1216
02:10:03,390 --> 02:10:04,500
Right now.

1217
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:06,930
Weddings aren't up for auction.

1218
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:10,200
In your absence no one's going to bid...

1219
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:12,270
for your bride and win.

1220
02:10:14,900 --> 02:10:16,000
Silence.

1221
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:21,860
Tell me...

1222
02:10:22,730 --> 02:10:24,700
when the police...

1223
02:10:24,790 --> 02:10:26,000
arrested the accused...

1224
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:28,040
why couldn't you see him?

1225
02:10:30,370 --> 02:10:32,390
Because I was in the adjoining room.

1226
02:10:32,690 --> 02:10:34,826
The quarrel between the manager
and his business partner...

1227
02:10:34,850 --> 02:10:36,810
could be heard in that room.

1228
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:39,160
I heard the gunshot there.

1229
02:10:39,610 --> 02:10:41,020
And then?

1230
02:10:41,970 --> 02:10:44,730
Manager came out of the room panting.

1231
02:10:45,290 --> 02:10:47,320
Did you see the revolver in his hands?

1232
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:50,620
Did you see the gun being fired?

1233
02:10:52,270 --> 02:10:54,380
You only heard the voices
from your room?

1234
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,580
And after hearing those voices...

1235
02:10:58,020 --> 02:10:59,730
you came to the conclusion...

1236
02:11:00,350 --> 02:11:02,390
the manager had killed
his business partner.

1237
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:06,040
- Yes.
- One last question.

1238
02:11:08,950 --> 02:11:11,010
Why did you give this check
to the manager?

1239
02:11:12,610 --> 02:11:13,710
Why?

1240
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:18,380
Check? Listen sahab.

1241
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:21,520
The... manager...

1242
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:23,610
he... he... I mean, I...

1243
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:26,750
enjoy watching dance and drama.

1244
02:11:27,170 --> 02:11:28,880
- And...
- Yes, yes?

1245
02:11:29,430 --> 02:11:30,670
Speak.

1246
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:32,240
Don't hesitate.

1247
02:11:32,890 --> 02:11:34,190
Why give the check?

1248
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:36,740
I... I mean...

1249
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:38,790
how can I tell all?

1250
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:44,320
And the secret is such...

1251
02:11:44,900 --> 02:11:48,820
it might be important for
your future father-in-law.

1252
02:11:50,510 --> 02:11:52,430
But you should know...

1253
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:54,910
until the court adjourns...

1254
02:11:55,410 --> 02:11:57,240
you'll have to stay here.

1255
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:00,810
Your honor, fear god at least.

1256
02:12:01,270 --> 02:12:02,510
Is this justified?

1257
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:04,200
Today's my wedding day.

1258
02:12:04,530 --> 02:12:06,130
What will my father-in-law say?

1259
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:07,430
What will my poor bride do?

1260
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:13,330
She is faced with this problem.

1261
02:12:13,990 --> 02:12:16,240
Oh your honor, oh lawyer sahab...

1262
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:19,190
oh guardji, what cruelty is this?

1263
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:22,190
Think of my bitterly crying bride.

1264
02:12:22,740 --> 02:12:25,320
Oh God, preserve my honor.

1265
02:12:57,910 --> 02:13:00,240
Catch him! He's running
away with my bicycle.

1266
02:13:01,730 --> 02:13:03,290
Give me my bicycle.

1267
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:07,840
The police, the lawyers...

1268
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:11,860
the court, everyone has conjectured.

1269
02:13:12,370 --> 02:13:15,150
Who's he, where did he come from?

1270
02:13:15,610 --> 02:13:17,010
What does he do?

1271
02:13:20,310 --> 02:13:21,810
But he couldn't tell us.

1272
02:13:22,110 --> 02:13:23,510
Could he utter any word...

1273
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:25,610
to answer any question?

1274
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:27,110
No.

1275
02:13:28,420 --> 02:13:31,250
Is this such a difficult riddle?

1276
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:33,260
Anyone can...

1277
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:35,630
guess his past life...

1278
02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:38,930
a story of murder and crime.

1279
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:41,420
He's fooling us even now.

1280
02:13:41,780 --> 02:13:43,140
Like a wolf...

1281
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:45,590
hiding in sheep's clothing.

1282
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:49,080
Your honor, I request...

1283
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:51,620
that you don't overlook the fact that...

1284
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:54,380
the accused is a thief...

1285
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:56,910
murderer, and a cruel man.

1286
02:13:57,290 --> 02:13:58,790
He should be declared guilty...

1287
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:00,400
and punished.

1288
02:14:11,410 --> 02:14:13,960
That's all, your honor.

1289
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:39,170
The case has been discussed. I hope...

1290
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,330
you all will study it...

1291
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:43,500
and legally...

1292
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:45,590
arrive at a fair ruling.

1293
02:14:51,650 --> 02:14:52,650
Your honor...

1294
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:55,760
before making any decision...

1295
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:57,760
hear the truth.

1296
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:00,530
- Who are you?
- Your honor...

1297
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:02,040
I'm a bank clerk.

1298
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:05,030
I want to give some important information.

1299
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:07,730
It's against court rules to do that.

1300
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:10,290
Your honor, maybe...

1301
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:12,560
it is so, but...

1302
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:14,560
a few moments...

1303
02:15:14,620 --> 02:15:17,280
of the court are not more important
than a life.

1304
02:15:17,990 --> 02:15:19,090
Okay.

1305
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:23,850
What new info do you have...

1306
02:15:24,310 --> 02:15:26,360
about this case?

1307
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:29,360
Your honor, he's not the murderer.

1308
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,220
He is!

1309
02:15:33,230 --> 02:15:34,570
I was there.

1310
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:37,650
In front of me he...

1311
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:41,300
shot his colleague only...

1312
02:15:41,810 --> 02:15:43,290
because he'd...

1313
02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:46,140
already murdered a woman in Bombay.

1314
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:48,140
And his colleague...

1315
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:51,390
was threatening to disclose it.

1316
02:15:52,620 --> 02:15:53,660
Your honor...

1317
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:55,730
let me go now.

1318
02:15:56,090 --> 02:15:57,200
It's my wedding.

1319
02:15:59,630 --> 02:16:00,630
Silence.

1320
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:15,800
It's late. Why has the groom's
party not arrived yet?

1321
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:18,310
Wonder what happened.

1322
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:21,870
I'll go and see.

1323
02:16:33,990 --> 02:16:35,860
Your honor, this watch is evidence.

1324
02:16:36,610 --> 02:16:38,570
This watch. Mr. Kamal...

1325
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:41,470
Don't you recognize it?

1326
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:44,490
It's your father...

1327
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:46,180
Shadilalji's.

1328
02:16:58,400 --> 02:16:59,670
I'm the bank's manager.

1329
02:17:00,549 --> 02:17:02,619
This watch was given to Shadilal...

1330
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,680
for his honesty, by me.

1331
02:17:05,350 --> 02:17:07,680
But, Kamal's father, Shadilal...

1332
02:17:08,129 --> 02:17:10,019
was a dishonest man.

1333
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:12,020
He cheated the bank...

1334
02:17:12,180 --> 02:17:13,590
murdered a woman...

1335
02:17:13,889 --> 02:17:15,379
- and escaped.
- No, no.

1336
02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:18,170
This is untrue. It is false.

1337
02:17:18,639 --> 02:17:20,669
Shadilal is neither crooked...

1338
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:22,480
nor dishonest.

1339
02:17:22,790 --> 02:17:26,190
This doesn't throw
any light on this case.

1340
02:17:26,750 --> 02:17:28,340
It does, your honor.

1341
02:17:29,209 --> 02:17:31,229
Because the bank's treasurer...

1342
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:33,150
was accused of embezzlement.

1343
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,440
The one who was always honest...

1344
02:17:37,410 --> 02:17:41,110
is being hunted by the law.

1345
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:44,000
I am Kamal's innocent...

1346
02:17:44,670 --> 02:17:47,130
father, Shadilal.

1347
02:17:52,559 --> 02:17:54,409
I was silent only because...

1348
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:58,590
I wanted my silence to be Kamal's success.

1349
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:02,900
A father who was of
no use to his children...

1350
02:18:03,969 --> 02:18:06,319
could not have missed this opportunity.

1351
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:08,320
The noose round my neck...

1352
02:18:08,879 --> 02:18:11,309
put by my son's own hands.

1353
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:16,520
Just to see Kamal smile
at least once...

1354
02:18:17,150 --> 02:18:19,840
a shamed father
would've died happily.

1355
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:24,500
But even before listening
to the court's ruling...

1356
02:18:24,940 --> 02:18:26,240
I found out...

1357
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:28,880
that an innocent person's sin...

1358
02:18:29,219 --> 02:18:30,339
had already become immortal.

1359
02:18:30,930 --> 02:18:32,280
The charge on the innocent...

1360
02:18:32,740 --> 02:18:34,280
will remain after his death.

1361
02:18:34,940 --> 02:18:35,980
His shadow...

1362
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:39,010
will never leave his children.

1363
02:18:39,790 --> 02:18:40,790
This fear...

1364
02:18:41,230 --> 02:18:43,460
took away the peace
that comes with death.

1365
02:18:44,290 --> 02:18:46,030
I ask for a death sentence.

1366
02:18:47,030 --> 02:18:48,500
Death, earned by Kamal.

1367
02:18:49,350 --> 02:18:52,470
And from the world, just one thing.

1368
02:18:53,139 --> 02:18:55,029
After an innocent's death...

1369
02:18:55,660 --> 02:18:58,010
don't remind his children...

1370
02:18:58,580 --> 02:19:00,390
that their father was a criminal.

1371
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:20,020
Really? No, no.

1372
02:19:20,830 --> 02:19:22,430
Impossible.

1373
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:31,200
What happened?

1374
02:19:31,540 --> 02:19:32,840
Did Ramesh phone?

1375
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:34,730
Don't worry.

1376
02:19:34,990 --> 02:19:36,390
I have to go.

1377
02:19:36,639 --> 02:19:38,569
Then go. Hurry up.

1378
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:18,400
Father.

1379
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:24,600
I agree with the members of the jury.

1380
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:26,600
I order...

1381
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:30,010
the release of the accused Shadilal.

1382
02:20:30,570 --> 02:20:33,940
And Chatrasen accused of murdering Tara...

1383
02:20:34,490 --> 02:20:36,230
and Ramesh and Chatrasen...

1384
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:38,530
accused of murdering in this case...

1385
02:20:38,870 --> 02:20:40,410
under article 6:302...

1386
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:42,790
to be sued.

1387
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:54,500
- What about your wedding?
- Stripped in public!

1388
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:36,380
- My son.
- Please forgive me.

1389
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:39,560
- I...
- That was your duty.

1390
02:21:40,030 --> 02:21:41,490
I was really happy...

1391
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:44,270
that in the court...

1392
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:46,070
you stood steadfast in your duty.

1393
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:50,200
Have you seen Mr. Kamal?

1394
02:21:50,470 --> 02:21:52,200
Yes. He went this way.

1395
02:22:05,430 --> 02:22:07,560
My little daughter.

1396
02:22:15,940 --> 02:22:17,850
You are really very generous.

1397
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:20,340
It's your greatness Manager sahab.

1398
02:22:29,310 --> 02:22:31,420
Kamal, hurry up.

1399
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:33,900
The people of the groom's party
are waiting for you.

1400
02:22:34,290 --> 02:22:35,710
It's the wedding day.

1401
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:38,880
Kamal? Your wedding?

1402
02:22:41,430 --> 02:22:45,680
Your father's lucky. Durgadasji...

1403
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:49,890
Wedding's not an auction.

1404
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:53,150
No one's going to bid for your bride.

1405
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:03,830
Come on son, Kamal.

1406
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:03,520
- Is Ramesh here?
- Yes.

1407
02:24:04,450 --> 02:24:06,180
You get Madhuri.

1408
02:25:12,190 --> 02:25:15,550
Congratulations, Ramesh.
My wishes are fulfilled.

1409
02:25:17,510 --> 02:25:19,140
Here. Take care of your Madhuri.

1410
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:47,700
The monsoon is in the air

1411
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:10,260
In the eyes of the flowering buds...

1412
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:18,440
are signs of merriment
