1
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,675
In the ancient times
of the Mahabharata...

2
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,553
a tribal boy...

3
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:01,152
wanted to learn the art of archery.
He went to the great guru Dronacharya.

4
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,433
But Drona refused.

5
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:16,941
He was mentor to princes and kings.
How could he teach a low caste tribal?

6
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,440
He returned to the jungle.

7
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,605
He made a statue of Drona...

8
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,143
called it his Guru
and practiced archery, night and day.

9
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,659
One day, Drona was out hunting.

10
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,129
Suddenly, his dog stopped barking.

11
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:45,264
Seven arrows had sealed
its mouth shut.

12
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,441
The archer had shot the arrows
with such skill...

13
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,678
...that the dog felt no pain,
and shed no blood.

14
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:58,243
No pain, no blood.
No pain, no blood.

15
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,581
Drona was astonished.
Who was this skilled archer?

16
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,453
This magical marksman?

17
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,094
Do you know who it was?
- Eklavya!

18
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:13,432
His name was Eklavya.
Your name is Eklavya too.

19
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:20,505
Yes, my mother named me after
that great archer.

20
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:30,410
Then?
- Then, Drona was baffled.

21
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,448
This untouchable tribal was superior
to his star pupil, Prince Arjun.

22
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,448
He had to be stopped.

23
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,561
Drona said, 'Son, you have
trained before my statue.

24
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,488
Claimed me as your guru.
You must pay my fee.'

25
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,596
Eklavya smiled and said,
'Whatever you wish, O' Guru.'

26
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,107
Do you know what Drona demanded?
- What?

27
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:00,709
Eklavya's right thumb.
- His thumb! Why?

28
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,551
Without his thumb,
how would Eklavya draw his bowstring?

29
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,917
He could never outshine Prince Arjun.

30
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,049
Eklavya didn't cut off
his thumb, did he?

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,296
Eklavya merely smiled, cut off his
thumb and offered it at his Guru's feet.

32
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:23,534
No pain. No blood.
No pain. No blood. No...

33
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:28,064
...No Nandini. There was a lot of pain.
A lot of blood.

34
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,339
But without flinching,
Eklavya fulfilled...

35
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,541
...his dharma. His sacred duty.
- What kind of dharma is this?

36
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,542
This dharma is wrong.
I'd have refused.

37
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,512
Eklavya was wrong.

38
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,356
Eklavya was wrong.

39
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,914
'Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

40
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,310
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

41
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,123
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

42
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,255
And summer's lease
hath all too short a date.

43
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,456
Sometime too hot
the eye of heaven shines...

44
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,629
And often it is
his gold complexion dimm'd;

45
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:37,431
And every fair from fair
sometime declines,

46
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,942
By chance or
nature's changing course untrimm'd.'

47
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,647
Remember this sonnet?

48
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:53,520
I read it to you when
you first came to Devigarh.

49
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,896
And you gifted me this flower.

50
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,228
It has withered away now.

51
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,905
'But thy eternal summer...

52
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,649
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

53
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,925
Nor lose possession... '

54
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,531
Mother says call Eklavya.

55
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:59,022
Dear son, by God's grace, the Queen
is recovering from her illness.

56
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,898
Yet gloom engulfs me.

57
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:12,132
Putting this pen to paper
is my only solace.

58
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:22,313
Only through these letters,
can my heart speak.

59
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,383
The rest is silence.

60
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,217
I am but a mere wall of this fort.

61
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,991
That exists only to protect the King.

62
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:47,094
Each moment of my life is a brick
in this wall.

63
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,235
But this wall is now ravaged by age.

64
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,415
The eagle eyes that once watched
over this fort are going blind.

65
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,191
But my ears miss nothing.

66
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,091
What does it yearn for?

67
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,297
Perhaps, your voice calling out to me.

68
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,509
When an aging father's hands
begin to tremble...

69
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:28,208
...it is his son's duty
to give him a helping hand.

70
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,313
Where are you, my son?

71
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,696
Water? Some water, my Queen?

72
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,367
Mother says, Call Eklavya.

73
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,371
Mother says, Call Eklavya.

74
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,485
Would you like some water?
- Eklavya.

75
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,967
Call whom, dearest?
- Eklavya.

76
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:32,074
Who?
- Eklavya.

77
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,085
No!

78
00:08:58,905 --> 00:08:59,872
No!

79
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,452
Mother is dead.
Now we don't need Eklavya.

80
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,042
Eklavya!

81
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,451
To the Queen's chamber. Now!

82
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,751
Send for my son, Eklavya.

83
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,935
Call my son! Now!

84
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,474
Father.

85
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,351
How are your eyes?

86
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,255
Absolutely fine.

87
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,597
Fine?
Nothing is fine, Prince.

88
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,369
The sun's glare blinds him completely.

89
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,941
Rajjo took him to the doctor.

90
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:35,276
He said his eyes were...
'photosensitive'.

91
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,176
Yes. Mother mentioned it in her letter.
I will speak with the doctor.

92
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,952
How's Rajjo?
- She's fine. Thank you.

93
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,525
Rajjo was with Her Highness
through her illness.

94
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,486
She said the Queen really missed you.

95
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,361
Come here now.

96
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,433
Hurry!

97
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,334
Should a Prince make such a
public spectacle of himself?

98
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,504
Should a Queen pull
her Prince's ears like this?

99
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,933
Oh? So she shouldn't?

100
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,470
What would you have her do,
mighty Prince?

101
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,475
She should say sorry.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

102
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,256
Good you came, Harsh.

103
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,932
Such a shame you couldn't be here
when your mother really needed you.

104
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,469
Anyway, it's too late now.

105
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,340
Come on. Let's go.

106
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,903
I seek your blessings.
- She kept calling your name.

107
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,598
And left us.

108
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,914
I said, 'I am here too!

109
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,550
Your husband. Call my name.'
But she wouldn't.

110
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,923
Just kept calling your name.

111
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,987
Do you know how it felt?
I felt so...

112
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:46,093
Just called your name and...
she's gone.

113
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:48,940
Brother.

114
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,050
Mild heart attack.
She was recovering but then...

115
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,878
Go. Get ready.

116
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:06,591
The funeral rites must begin
before sunset.

117
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,218
Wear a white dhoti.
You'll find one in your room.

118
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,358
It's the culture here.
They are touchy about it. Let's go.

119
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,409
Mother, your last words were,
'Take care of Harsh.'

120
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,942
Give me the strength...

121
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,479
...to ease his grief.

122
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,515
Guide me, Mother...

123
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,096
How is he?
- Why so restless, child?

124
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:51,064
See the fort? Your love cannot
scale those high walls...

125
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,433
...Did he ask about me?
- He did.

126
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,033
What did he ask?
- 'How is Rajjo? '

127
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,880
See.

128
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,885
Lord, look after my daughter.

129
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,389
She's innocent, she's naive.

130
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,390
Please don't break her heart.

131
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,067
Nandini.

132
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,385
Nandini. Where are you?

133
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,122
O' Kind King, is Princess Nandini home?

134
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,156
Princess Nandini is not here.

135
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,064
Oh! Where could she be?

136
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,532
She's gone to the temple
with her mother.

137
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,501
Please tell her that her brother Harsh
had come to meet her.

138
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,446
She will...
I mean... I will.

139
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,887
Ok then, I'll just go back to London.

140
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,895
Fooled you! Fooled you!

141
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:29,623
Don't you get it? Mother is dead.
How could I go to the temple with her?

142
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,564
I didn't think of that.
- And don't talk about leaving.

143
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,132
Everyone leaves me.

144
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,134
Except Rajjo.
But she also leaves at night.

145
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,479
Rajjo stay here at night.
I get frightened alone.

146
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,474
Won't you stay, Rajjo?

147
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,617
How are you, Rajjo?
- I'm well.

148
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,919
Your father told me,
you took good care of my mother.

149
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,327
Rajjo was always there
for her... always.

150
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,199
The Queen really missed you.

151
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,635
She left you this letter.

152
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,271
She asked that you read it alone.

153
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,212
Then she said, 'Take care of Harsh.'
Didn't she, Rajjo?

154
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,051
Dear son...

155
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:32,153
Will it be me, or my letter
that will greet you...

156
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,632
on your return?

157
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:41,970
I take every breath with caution,
fearing each will be my last.

158
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:49,273
I hope I live to hold you
one last time.

159
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,549
But I fear that will not be.
This letter then...

160
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,487
...must reveal to you,
the secret of your birth.

161
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,717
Son, King Jaywardhan is not
your father.

162
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:08,228
He could never be one.
Nature didn't wish it so.

163
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:16,135
When it was discovered, he couldn't
give the Kingdom an heir...

164
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,543
...your grandmother resorted
to an age-old tradition of...

165
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,447
...begetting an heir from a sage.

166
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,619
The quest took us to
the banks of the holy river Gangotri.

167
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,286
Eklavya was with us.

168
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:45,135
The Queen Mother trusted Eklavya
more than any sage.

169
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,639
So did I.

170
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,975
You and Nandini have a noble father.
Eklavya.

171
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:08,116
I tell you this now because
your father needs you.

172
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:14,055
He is growing old and blind.

173
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,949
If your father learns that
I've revealed this secret...

174
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,579
...he will believe I violated our vow.
I failed my dharma. My sacred duty.

175
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:50,125
But I believe dharma is,
as the great Mahabharata says.

176
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:57,107
'Dharmah Matibhyah Udghrutah.'

177
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,470
Dharma is born from reason.

178
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:08,110
Dharma is born from intellect.

179
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:12,919
It is what your heart,
your mind feels is right.

180
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,592
Dharma is what your soul accepts
as true and sacred.

181
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,931
I have fulfilled my dharma.

182
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,967
Now son... you must fulfill yours.

183
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:30,135
Promise me, you will look after
your father.

184
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,406
I promise, mother.

185
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,387
I'll chop off Eklavya's head and
hang it at the gate!

186
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,391
He has contaminated our royal blood.

187
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,962
Why didn't you tell me this before?

188
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,698
I didn't know myself.

189
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,558
All these years I believed our mother.

190
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:06,237
She said it was some sage
from Gangotri.

191
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,312
I believed her.

192
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,611
The Queen bore twins.

193
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,588
One, a mentally challenged daughter.

194
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,051
Even that, I accepted.

195
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,224
But today I find...

196
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,493
...a worthless guard...

197
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,506
...the father of my children.

198
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,409
He slept with my Queen.

199
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:51,317
Jyoti. He sired my children.

200
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,658
My wife... and my guard!

201
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:59,088
So submissive all these years.
Head bowed.

202
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,160
How he must've laughed.

203
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,903
Laughed at my inadequacies. At my
every shameful flaw. Even this, Jyoti!

204
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,410
Eklavya is coming.

205
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:24,722
Bastard!

206
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:28,721
Sir?

207
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,424
Tell him, Jyoti!

208
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,461
His Highness has just received
a death threat.

209
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,501
The caller said, we must return
the farmers their land...

210
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,097
...or the King will die.

211
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,498
How can this be?

212
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,502
They failed to repay their debt.
We annexed their land.

213
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,575
Bhiku, their leader,
was found dead...

214
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,246
...on the railway track,
with a suicide note.

215
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,578
But they accuse us of his murder.
The bastards!

216
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,353
Now go.
Go!

217
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,292
Find my son. Tell him,
his father's life is in danger.

218
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,596
Whose life? His father's. Now go!

219
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:34,926
Jyoti.

220
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,927
I spoke the truth. Didn't I?

221
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,533
Whoever is Harsh's father...

222
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:48,003
...will die.
- Rest assured, Brother.

223
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:54,111
Before sunset tomorrow,
Eklavya will burn on his pyre...

224
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,277
...just like the Queen.

225
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,457
Prince, I looked for you everywhere.
What are you doing here? Alone?

226
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:23,097
Mother is the one alone, Eklavya.
Everyone abandoned her.

227
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,407
Will you sit with us?

228
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:33,407
She will like that.
- You are needed back at the fort.

229
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,587
Your father has received
a death threat.

230
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,048
My father?

231
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,483
Do I have a father?

232
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,926
Have you seen my father?

233
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,400
I want to meet him.

234
00:27:56,074 --> 00:28:00,943
Tell him,
I sit here alone with my mother.

235
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:06,880
Tell him, I miss him.
Can he join us?

236
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,350
What was she to him? Nothing?

237
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,586
Can't he do this much?

238
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,245
Let's go...

239
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,244
...Prince.

240
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,617
I want to cry, Eklavya.

241
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,390
But the tears don't come.

242
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,864
Will you hold me?

243
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:00,626
Please.

244
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,875
Son, do not extend your hand.

245
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,881
If I hold you, it'd call for disaster!

246
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,355
After that fateful trip to Gangotri...

247
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,124
your mother and I were strangers till the end.

248
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:28,461
We swore not to let our children
even realise...

249
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,560
that I'm their father.

250
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,301
Nandini's guileless laughter...
it breaks my heart.

251
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,010
I want to hold her and cry out,
'I am your father.'

252
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:45,210
But this can never be.

253
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:47,940
Never.

254
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,705
Harsh!

255
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,441
Are you crying Harsh?

256
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,466
Why?

257
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,342
Please don't.
Do you miss Mother?

258
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:24,654
She's with us, silly.
We have many mothers.

259
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,353
One, two, three, four...
Would you like to meet them?

260
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,428
See?
'Mother at Diwali.' Isn't she lovely?

261
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,629
'Birthday Mother.'
Please see.

262
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,575
'Mother at the Temple.'

263
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:52,582
'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star Mother.'

264
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,146
And this one is...

265
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,159
No. Not this one.

266
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,528
It's a bad painting.
- Show me that painting.

267
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,158
No! It's horrible.

268
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,334
It has blood.
- It's alright.

269
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,097
Tell me. What is it?

270
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,339
The secret can never leave that room.
He will kill me.

271
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,510
Who?
- I can't tell you.

272
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,246
If the secret leaves that room,
he'll kill me.

273
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,506
Which room?

274
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,588
If the secret leaves that room,
he'll kill me.

275
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,013
Which room?

276
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:51,642
Now, the secret will
never leave mother's room.

277
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,913
But the door is open.

278
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,352
Are you nervous, Bablu?

279
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:47,357
Don't worry. We live in a democracy.
These are mere cardboard kings.

280
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:50,263
My baton is far mightier than
their sword.

281
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,908
Hey Bablu, see this wall?

282
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,313
My ancestor was buried
alive in this wall.

283
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:09,919
Just like a ribbon is cut
to inaugurate a new building...

284
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:15,615
...these kings killed us untouchables
for good luck!

285
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,258
Meet my ancestor, Kalwa Chohar.

286
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,631
If I didn't yearn to meet Eklavya again...

287
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,645
...I wouldn't even piss on this fort!

288
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:36,513
Come on.

289
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,649
Sir, recognize me?

290
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:50,184
I am Pannu. Pannalal Chohar.
Dhannalal Chohar's son.

291
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,429
I seek your blessings.

292
00:33:55,633 --> 00:34:01,594
Remember the Dussera fair?
I am the boy who caught the bell.

293
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:20,924
Remember?

294
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:26,120
You were amazing.
I couldn't sleep all night.

295
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,228
I was inspired. I wanted to become
someone worthy like you.

296
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:36,540
And here I am.
Myself, Police Chief Pannalal Chohar.

297
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,270
Thank you, Sir.

298
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,245
I would give anything to see that
feat again.

299
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,052
Will you... please?

300
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,956
I'm not sure I can do it anymore, son.

301
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,191
No harm trying.

302
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,889
Please meet His Highness first. Come.

303
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,064
One moment.
Promise?

304
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,025
Yes. Come.

305
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,615
These damn farmers have gone mad!
They have threatened to kill me.

306
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,928
Are you writing the report, Bablu?

307
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,132
I am not a bad writer myself,
Your Highness.

308
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,502
Why does the troubled King
hide in his mighty mansion?

309
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,535
Does he fear those poor naked farmers
harbor a secret passion?

310
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:48,071
Should he not know
that time and tide wait for none?

311
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:52,114
You dare mock me?
Don't forget, I'm King Jaywardhan.

312
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:55,081
And you are a mere...
- Untouchable? I wouldn't say it.

313
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,887
In our democracy,
discrimination is a crime.

314
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:01,889
Under which act, Bablu?

315
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,396
Never mind the act.
Handcuffs would be a fact.

316
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:13,059
For generations, we have been the law.
And you dare to speak of handcuffs?

317
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,469
We have ruled for 2000 years.

318
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,910
And we have suffered for 5000 years!

319
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:28,144
I'm the grandson of that low caste man
buried alive in this fort.

320
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:30,511
Your good luck charm!

321
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,922
I'm the child of those untouchables,
whose hands were cut off...

322
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,323
...for daring to touch the holy books.

323
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,330
Enough history!

324
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,127
Your security will be here in an hour.

325
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,737
One hour?

326
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:51,631
That's democracy for you,
Your Highness. Free will, you see.

327
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,938
Some cops will be at the tea stalls.
Some at the sweet shop.

328
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,344
Rounding them up takes time, no?

329
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,383
I'm off then.

330
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,219
Shall we, Sir?

331
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:36,449
Will you show me now, Sir?
- You don't give up easily, Pannalal.

332
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,479
How do you think an untouchable got
to be a highly decorated officer?

333
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:43,188
Bablu, the blindfold!
- I don't need one.

334
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,996
The sunlight blinds me anyway.

335
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,431
But you did it with a blindfold then.
It looks impressive.

336
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,003
All right.

337
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,040
Ready Sir?
- Yes.

338
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,998
We can't do that with our eyes open.
How do you do it blindfolded?

339
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:10,741
Drowned...

340
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:16,003
...my father drowned
protecting his King.

341
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:26,183
I searched the lake all night.

342
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:32,560
Then mother came.
- Son.

343
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:40,261
This belonged to your father.
Now you must accept it as yours.

344
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:45,271
From this day on,
he will live through you.

345
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:53,541
Henceforth, you have only one dharma.
The protection of your King.

346
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,082
Fail and nine generations
of our family will burn in hell.

347
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:11,492
Like the unbending Eklavya
you too must follow your dharma.

348
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,608
From that day on
she named me Eklavya...

349
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:31,450
...and my father's weapon
became my only companion.

350
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:38,518
No one knows this story.
I don't know why I told you.

351
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,457
I'll tell you why.
It's because you like me.

352
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:59,476
Sir, were you present when the
King received the death threat?

353
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,611
No. Only his brother Jyoti was there.

354
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,056
The one who lives in the red bungalow.
Near the railway tracks. Right?

355
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,627
Goodbye then, Sir.

356
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:42,091
By sunset, Eklavya will be by
your side. Do what you want with him.

357
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:50,760
What shall I do, my Queen?
You were always my guide.

358
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,431
Should I call Jyoti or not?

359
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,406
His Highness hasn't called yet.

360
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,914
His Highness! '
'His Highness! '

361
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:11,911
My blood boils every time you call
that eunuch 'His Highness! '

362
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,322
If Harsh treated me so,
I'd put a bullet through his head.

363
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,494
Uday, how do I look?

364
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,494
'His Highness! '
'As you wish, Your Highness! '

365
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:33,507
How can you call him 'Your Highness? '
I'm ashamed to call him uncle.

366
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,946
How long have you been
calling him uncle?

367
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,513
27 years.
- 52 years!

368
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:47,520
52 years of 'Yes, Your Highness,'
'No, Your Highness,'

369
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,620
'Your wish is my command,
Your Highness.'

370
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,389
Hello, Jyoti.
- Yes, Your Highness.

371
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,361
The police have bought the story.

372
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,899
That's good, Your Highness.
We leave in half an hour.

373
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,576
What time is it in your watch?
- 5:25 p.m.

374
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,045
It's four minutes fast.
Please adjust it.

375
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:14,914
We will meet at 6:10 p.m. Your Highness.
Exactly 6:10 p.m.

376
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,919
Dad... we have a guest.

377
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,936
It's gone. It's gone.
Rajjo lost her kite!

378
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:41,240
I cut it!
I cut the kite loose!

379
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:48,947
Rajjo deliberately lost the kite
contest. Nandini is delighted.

380
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,249
Rajjo's a lovely girl, Omkar.

381
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:58,891
You've brought her up very well.
- Hardly.

382
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,888
I was so busy driving
these royals around...

383
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,565
...I never noticed when
my little girl grew up.

384
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,600
She's lovely.
I worry about whom she will marry.

385
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:15,908
It will all work out, Omkar.

386
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:18,911
Mr. Marksman...

387
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:23,578
...l've been telling you for years.

388
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:28,488
If you had bothered to marry
and produced a handsome son...

389
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,927
...I wouldn't have had to worry.

390
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:36,626
They'd fall in love and marry.
We'd be in-laws, dear Marksman.

391
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,096
Look! The Prince is here.

392
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:44,741
Let me see.

393
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:52,638
What's the King done
to deserve such a wonderful son?

394
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,083
The Queen's death has left him
very lonely.

395
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,411
I feel like giving him a hug.

396
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,528
Father.

397
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,900
No, little Prince.
Don't call me father.

398
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:19,908
I don't have that right.
I'm just a humble servant.

399
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,969
I would love to hug him too.

400
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:30,416
But I can't.
I don't have that right.

401
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,924
I'm just a humble servant.

402
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:46,433
You really take good care of her.
Thank you.

403
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:54,274
It pleases me to see her happy.
Now that you're here, shall I go?

404
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:55,945
Please wait.

405
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:01,506
Do you remember mother's lullaby?

406
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,888
The Moon Song?
- Yes.

407
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,887
Would you sing it for me?

408
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,395
Here? Now?
- Please.

409
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,462
I miss mother.

410
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:36,553
Hear anything?

411
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:42,483
You can only see with binoculars,
Mr. Marksman. Not hear.

412
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,257
She's singing.

413
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:53,525
My child, my moon.

414
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:00,475
Smile softly, my moon-child.

415
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:07,882
Come gently...

416
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,047
...my eyes are your sky.
Frolic there forever.

417
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:04,071
Gently, O' tenderly.

418
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:08,867
Swing from the clouds.
Swing and smile.

419
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:15,282
Smile, my moon-child!

420
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:22,187
Smile softly, my moon-child.

421
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:29,487
Come gently...

422
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,901
my eyes are your sky.
Frolic there forever.

423
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,916
Smile softly, moon-child.

424
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,929
Frolic there forever.

425
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,962
His Highness has summoned you both.
Right away!

426
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,569
Right away? Where to?

427
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,260
The Queen loved this sonnet.

428
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:10,933
Shakespeare.

429
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,934
She died listening to it.

430
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,599
Eklavya, where would you
like to be cremated?

431
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:49,705
Sir?

432
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,976
God forbid, if you were to die
unexpectedly...

433
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,611
...where would they cremate you?

434
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,909
Sir... my village, Dhachigam.

435
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:10,184
That just won't do!
You've served us so long.

436
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,090
You will be cremated...

437
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:20,235
in the royal grounds.

438
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,066
Alongside your Queen.

439
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,297
Down, Your Highness...

440
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,490
Kill him!
Kill him!

441
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,577
What are you doing?
Kill him!

442
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,635
Are you deaf?
Kill him now!

443
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,347
Yes, Your Highness.
Your wish is my command.

444
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,236
Your Highness...

445
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,614
Your Highness...

446
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,731
Your Highness, they've taken my brother.
They say we murdered the King.

447
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:29,609
They'll hang our boys.
- They call us farmers.

448
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,173
But we don't have enough land
for our own graves.

449
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:38,317
First they take our land.
Now our sons.

450
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:44,186
We tried to protest,
but they killed Bhiku, our leader...

451
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,322
...and called it a suicide.
Your Highness. Listen to us.

452
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:52,360
We are being framed.
It's a conspiracy.

453
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,636
Enough. We can't take it anymore.

454
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,433
Whose camel is this?

455
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,440
Whose camel is this?

456
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:03,712
Speak up!

457
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:34,743
Rajjo...?

458
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,012
I will marry Rajjo.

459
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,083
I seek your blessings.

460
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,471
May I come in?

461
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:04,103
This is now your home, Rajjo.
You can come and go as you please.

462
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:07,816
Thank you.

463
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,609
Thank you for what?

464
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:20,028
Thank you for making my father smile.

465
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,403
Your promise of marriage
helped him go peacefully.

466
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:31,366
I saw him smile.

467
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:41,276
But now that he's gone...

468
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:46,187
I won't hold you to your promise.

469
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:50,054
Rajjo, I...
- Please let me finish.

470
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:59,224
Not that I'm not happy
with your promise.

471
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,504
Ever since I was a little girl...
...I dreamt of marrying you.

472
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,478
Dreamt of us being together.

473
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,410
Father thought I was naive.

474
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,119
But I had faith.

475
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:25,654
I always saw...

476
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:31,258
...my dream fulfilled
with your love.

477
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:35,766
Not your charity, or your pity.

478
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,369
May I speak now?

479
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:42,644
Rajjo...

480
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:48,750
Why did mother trust you
with her last letter?

481
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:52,617
Why does Nandini love you so dearly?

482
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,082
Her face lights up
when she hears your name.

483
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:01,153
Truth is...

484
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:07,298
...I too feel the same way.

485
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:16,941
But I remain silent.
I can't express myself.

486
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,949
Nandini can.

487
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,949
She is the only sane person
in this fort.

488
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:31,193
You know this fort...
it does terrible things to people.

489
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:38,961
This citadel of customs, traditions,
rites and rituals is driving me insane.

490
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,637
Rajjo...

491
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,577
I am no longer the Harsh
of your dreams.

492
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,472
For fifty years, you have enjoyed
the comforts of this fort.

493
01:06:19,776 --> 01:06:22,108
But when the King needed you most,
you ducked behind the camels!

494
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:23,946
Uday!

495
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:30,617
Were you singing hymns when the killer
kicked the gun from your hands?

496
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:35,557
Uday!
Show some respect to Eklavya.

497
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:41,255
For generations his family has
protected our kings.

498
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:48,128
He was blinded by the sun,
deafened by the train.

499
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:56,544
Otherwise those worthless farmers
couldn't have touched His Highness.

500
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:03,176
Officer, what has
your investigation revealed?

501
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:07,486
We now know that the camel
belonged to a farmer named Hariya.

502
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:10,992
He's being questioned.

503
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:14,660
Break Hariya's knees.
That'll sober his rebellion.

504
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:19,396
They were not farmers.

505
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:23,629
Eklavya?

506
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,010
How many fingers do you see?

507
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:40,416
Can't see from five feet away.
How do you know they were not farmers?

508
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:46,492
Eklavya's father sacrificed his life
protecting the King.

509
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:50,361
Ballads are sung in his praise.

510
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:02,200
So, tell me, Eklavya.
How did you escape all those bullets?

511
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:09,207
The farmers spared him.

512
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,119
The same lowly blood runs
through his veins.

513
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:20,393
Ah! I see.
A brotherhood of bastards.

514
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:36,643
Officer.
Please take his statement outside.

515
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,207
Sir...

516
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:09,370
You can't counter verbal insults
with a gun.

517
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,411
They asked me if I was busy
singing hymns...

518
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,650
...when the killer kicked away my gun.

519
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:18,586
And for that, you want to kill them?

520
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:20,656
Yes!

521
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,284
Sir, that's insane. Why?

522
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:27,996
I haven't told a soul...

523
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:31,324
...that my gun was kicked away.

524
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,002
How do they know?

525
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,006
What are you saying, Sir?

526
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:45,013
They assassinated my King.

527
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:48,648
I recognize the clang of his shoe.
It is them.

528
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,585
Out of my way-
- Sir... Sir. Please calm down.

529
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,315
Leave them to me. This is my sport.
They're my 'pigeons.'

530
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:58,355
You won't be able to do a thing.
Move out of my way.

531
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:02,030
I give you my word.
I'll get them. I'll find a way.

532
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,366
Straight or crooked.

533
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,727
Do you know they killed Bhiku,
the farmers' leader?

534
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:13,538
His suicide note was fake.
They will meet the same fate.

535
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:17,377
On the same railway track. With a
suicide note that is just as fake.

536
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:19,977
This is my job. I'll do it.

537
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,275
Out of my way, Pannalal.

538
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,648
If I let you through, you will
kill them, and hang for it.

539
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,488
So what? I do not care...
- If I must, I'll arrest you.

540
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,456
If I must, I'll kill you.

541
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,483
Give me the gun.

542
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:59,650
Enough bloodshed.
Give it to me.

543
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:35,316
You do not see what my blind eyes do.

544
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:41,524
They murdered the King. You're next.

545
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,668
They will kill you for the crown.

546
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:50,436
There's a jeep outside.
Take it and leave.

547
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:55,006
A monthly pension will reach you
in Dhachigam.

548
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,475
You're free.
Please leave.

549
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:04,186
Leave?

550
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:09,354
With my King's death un-avenged?

551
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:16,291
I am but a mere wall of this fort.

552
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:22,195
That exists only to protect the King.
Each moment...

553
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:26,302
...'Each moment of my life is
like a brick in this wall.

554
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,646
But this wall is now ravaged by age.

555
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:35,641
The eagle eyes that once watched
over this fort are going blind.'

556
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,452
You read my letters?

557
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,162
Yes.

558
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,002
Every word was written for me, right?

559
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,303
Who... who told you?

560
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:08,138
Mother.

561
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:20,251
Adharm!
She committed a sin!

562
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,558
I kept our secret buried within me
all my life.

563
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:27,969
The Queen has sinned!
- No.

564
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,632
Mother committed no sin.

565
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:39,307
Read her letter.

566
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,581
'Dharmah Matibhyah Udghrutah.'

567
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:54,995
Dharma is born from reason.

568
01:13:56,198 --> 01:14:02,626
It is what your heart
and mind embrace.

569
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,007
Mother fulfilled her dharma.

570
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,268
And now I, your son...

571
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:12,570
...will fulfill mine.

572
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,281
Please leave this place.

573
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:26,958
Your Highness.

574
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:30,999
Sir.

575
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:35,726
Son.

576
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,207
You cannot condemn me to exile.

577
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,211
You cannot!

578
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:50,209
How can a son condemn his father
to exile?

579
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:58,317
But a King...

580
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:01,653
...can banish his Royal Guard.

581
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:13,266
I, King Harshwardhan,
with the utmost respect...

582
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:18,946
command you, Eklavya,
to leave Devigarh immediately.

583
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:49,303
Your Highness!

584
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:29,174
Father, return to
your peaceful village.

585
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,552
Enjoy the simple pleasures
of farm life.

586
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,356
I will bring you back to this fort
only when I have driven out...

587
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:40,355
...the maddening echoes of
'dharma' and 'duty'

588
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:43,290
and replaced it with the cheerful
laughter of your grandchildren.

589
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:49,069
I want to see you smile.
You have suffered too much.

590
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:50,972
Harsh!

591
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:55,534
Harsh, the villagers tell me
you ordered Eklavya to leave.

592
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:57,372
Is it true?

593
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:02,617
Why?

594
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:09,291
Read this.

595
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:54,362
Hey! Who is it?

596
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:07,749
You?

597
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,643
What are you doing here?

598
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:15,656
King Harshwardhan has...
- Speak up.

599
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,158
Louder!

600
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,993
King Harshwardhan has banished me
from his fort.

601
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,525
I seek employment.

602
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:34,504
No work is beneath me.

603
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:36,705
I'd even shine your shoes.

604
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:45,020
Out!

605
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,450
I said get out!

606
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,261
Don't let me see your face again.

607
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,978
Your wish is my command.

608
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:16,142
Now get out!

609
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:25,124
This darkness
cloaks my face, Udaywardhan.

610
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,700
But I see you only too clearly.

611
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:40,003
I see the face of my King's murderer.

612
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:45,013
Your bullets are all spent.

613
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,515
Any sound now...

614
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:56,650
...will mean your death.

615
01:19:59,862 --> 01:20:04,458
I still hear you, Udaywardhan.
I can see every breath you take.

616
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:06,734
Quiet.

617
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:12,306
Quiet. Not a sound.

618
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:19,637
Your silence is your life.

619
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:25,653
If you breathe now
I will follow my dharma.

620
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,525
Your death is my duty.

621
01:21:17,005 --> 01:21:19,200
Why are you here?

622
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:23,978
King Harshwardhan has banished me
from his fort.

623
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:27,982
I've brought you a parting gift.

624
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,651
That's fine. Leave it at the gate.

625
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:38,617
Won't you take a look?

626
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:39,994
I said...

627
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:49,168
What's in this?
Open it.

628
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:15,957
Uday?

629
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:23,070
What have you done to my son?

630
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:26,474
Where is he?

631
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:29,667
Where is Uday?

632
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:38,177
He is strolling by the railway track.
Won't you join him?

633
01:22:40,022 --> 01:22:42,388
Have you ever seen Eklavya laugh?

634
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,620
No one has... except me.

635
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,994
When he saved me from a beating.

636
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:54,326
Who was going to beat you?
- Father.

637
01:22:56,438 --> 01:23:00,499
You must've done something.
- Not me. You did.

638
01:23:02,044 --> 01:23:05,104
Me?
What did I do?

639
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:11,349
Don't you remember?
- I can't remember.

640
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,624
The Queen was pulling your ear.

641
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:22,020
You were yelping, 'Does a Queen
pull her Prince's ear like this? '

642
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:28,561
Oh yes. When I kissed you
in front of everyone.

643
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,145
Eklavya saved me
from father's beating then.

644
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:41,976
Took me for a camel ride,
fed me guavas.

645
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,182
But I was still miserable.
- Why?

646
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:56,224
I said, 'I never got to kiss him back! '

647
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:04,001
When he heard that...

648
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:08,503
...he laughed...

649
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,637
...just like you did now.

650
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:42,437
I have to tell you something.

651
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,306
What's the matter, Harsh?

652
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,593
This is my father's gun.

653
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,997
If it weren't for you and Nandini...

654
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:11,399
...I swear to God, I...

655
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:14,369
You're scaring me.

656
01:25:16,178 --> 01:25:20,581
I'm scared too
...that you'll leave me.

657
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:24,645
Never. I promise...

658
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:29,954
...Wait.
Hear what I have to say...

659
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:33,585
...and then make that promise.

660
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:18,936
What have you done?
You killed my son!

661
01:26:19,975 --> 01:26:22,273
He killed my King.

662
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:27,603
I've fulfilled my dharma.
- Fulfilled your dharma?

663
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,618
Well done! Very well done!

664
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:34,146
Now go kill the man
who ordered the King's assassination.

665
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:37,652
Tell me his name.

666
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:42,490
And I'll bring you his head.

667
01:26:43,999 --> 01:26:49,562
You'll bring me your son's head?
Good! Very good!

668
01:26:55,076 --> 01:27:00,537
Harshwardhan ordered the killing.
Let's see you bring me his head!

669
01:27:02,117 --> 01:27:05,518
Harsh!
Harshwardhan, your son!

670
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:10,287
Behead your son. Fulfill your dharma.

671
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,994
Harshwardhan!

672
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:28,206
Wait, Rajjo.

673
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:30,411
Please.

674
01:27:36,851 --> 01:27:38,148
For whom?

675
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:45,420
You killed my father, Harsh.

676
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:16,521
You killed my son in the name of duty.
Now in the name of duty, go kill yours.

677
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:20,324
Lies!!
- It's true. He...

678
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:49,428
Is Nandini asleep?

679
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:54,330
You?
What are you doing here?

680
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:11,650
Waiting for you.

681
01:32:15,163 --> 01:32:16,960
You have blood on your face.

682
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,261
Whose blood is it?

683
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:23,364
I do not know.

684
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:28,965
Udaywardhan's... Jyotiwardhan's...

685
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:37,313
I've killed them both.

686
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:43,990
And now you are here to kill me.

687
01:32:47,195 --> 01:32:48,184
Yes.

688
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,995
But before my dagger finds its mark...

689
01:32:54,068 --> 01:33:00,530
...I must hear the truth from you.
Did you order the murder of my King?

690
01:33:08,216 --> 01:33:09,183
I did.

691
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,252
Then I, the Royal Guard of this fort...

692
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:23,961
...and your father...

693
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,292
...must perform my sacred duty.

694
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:33,974
Prepare to die.

695
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:39,680
My own father here to kill me...

696
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:44,277
...what better preparation for death.

697
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:49,314
I'm ready.

698
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:56,490
Why did you do it?

699
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:01,794
I never imagined,
you would kill for the crown...

700
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:06,070
...You think I'd kill...

701
01:34:06,441 --> 01:34:07,999
...for the crown?

702
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:14,614
Go ahead then.
Plunge your dagger into my heart.

703
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:16,951
Go on!

704
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:28,290
You cannot throw that dagger.

705
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:33,297
Because you know your son
would never stoop so low.

706
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:45,476
Why then?
Why this terrible sin? Why?

707
01:34:49,751 --> 01:34:53,187
Dharmah Matibhyah Udghrutah.

708
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:56,684
I saved your life.

709
01:34:58,126 --> 01:35:02,324
Look at this.
He murdered my mother.

710
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:05,563
Strangled her with his bare hands.

711
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:09,692
You know why?

712
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:14,274
Because your name was on her lips.

713
01:35:21,983 --> 01:35:24,349
I knew you would die next.

714
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:30,958
What is your price for this murder?

715
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:34,128
Just two and a half million!

716
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:38,762
I paid them ten times that
to save your life.

717
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,258
Lies!!

718
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:42,964
All lies!

719
01:35:44,005 --> 01:35:47,099
This can't be true!
My King could never do this.

720
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,439
Not in a million years.

721
01:35:54,015 --> 01:35:54,982
He wouldn't.

722
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:02,989
All you have is Nandini's word.

723
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:05,984
This could be her wild imagination...

724
01:36:07,195 --> 01:36:09,686
...like her flying stallions.

725
01:36:11,065 --> 01:36:12,930
Do not try to weaken my resolve...

726
01:36:13,734 --> 01:36:15,599
...Do not allow it to weaken, Eklavya.

727
01:36:17,205 --> 01:36:20,368
Cut off your thumb.
Fulfill your dharma.

728
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:26,947
Dharma?

729
01:36:29,984 --> 01:36:31,952
Dharma is above all question.

730
01:36:34,655 --> 01:36:37,954
Dharma is beyond debate.

731
01:36:39,694 --> 01:36:41,457
If I sway from my dharma
for this one moment...

732
01:36:41,696 --> 01:36:43,664
...nine generations of my family
will burn in hell.

733
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:53,471
Mother told me to fulfill my duty,
like the unbending Eklavya.

734
01:36:58,012 --> 01:36:59,309
Your death...

735
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:03,983
...is my duty.

736
01:37:13,027 --> 01:37:14,995
And yet, your hands tremble.

737
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:21,293
When an aging father's hands begin
to tremble...

738
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:27,029
...it is his son's duty
to give him a helping hand.

739
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:32,638
Where are you, my son?
- I am lost.

740
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:37,017
But I will find my way.

741
01:37:41,055 --> 01:37:43,023
My hands are stained with blood.

742
01:37:44,725 --> 01:37:46,590
The blood of Rajjo's father.

743
01:37:48,262 --> 01:37:50,253
I can never wash it away.

744
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:55,035
Let this bloodstain burn with me
on my pyre.

745
01:37:57,138 --> 01:37:59,038
Be gentle with Nandini.

746
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:04,533
Tell her, mother was lonely.
So I left to keep her company.

747
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:11,040
I shall tell mother
I kept my promise.

748
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:15,989
I shall beg forgiveness of
Rajjo's father.

749
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:20,388
I shall fulfill your duty.

750
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:25,492
Your duty... is my death.
- Stop Harsh!

751
01:38:26,701 --> 01:38:27,668
Don't!

752
01:38:32,607 --> 01:38:34,302
This is my dharma.

753
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:40,079
My hands may tremble
but my heart is unflinching.

754
01:38:46,053 --> 01:38:48,021
My eyes are weak but...

755
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,486
...my ears miss nothing.

756
01:38:55,062 --> 01:38:56,029
One...

757
01:38:58,733 --> 01:38:59,700
Just...

758
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:03,195
...one word...

759
01:39:05,139 --> 01:39:08,040
...and my dagger will find you.

760
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:10,744
Father.

761
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:12,646
Father.

762
01:39:24,025 --> 01:39:25,583
I thought you never missed.

763
01:39:26,027 --> 01:39:29,019
I didn't miss.
That was my finest throw ever.

764
01:39:31,032 --> 01:39:33,330
Instead of cutting off my thumb...

765
01:39:35,036 --> 01:39:38,005
...I struck the hand...

766
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,201
...that was about to kill my son.

767
01:39:49,050 --> 01:39:52,577
You were right, son.

768
01:39:53,054 --> 01:39:55,614
Eklavya was wrong,
Eklavya was wrong.

769
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:58,020
Eklavya was wrong.

770
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,421
So wrong.

771
01:40:41,736 --> 01:40:44,705
Mother, give me the strength...

772
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:48,174
...to follow your path.

773
01:40:49,143 --> 01:40:51,338
Let my conscience guide me.

774
01:40:53,681 --> 01:40:58,550
My heart tells me to forgive Harsh.

775
01:41:00,621 --> 01:41:04,216
He faltered, but his heart is pure.

776
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,028
He was willing to pay for it
with his life.

777
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:13,556
Too many lives have been lost.
Too much blood has been shed.

778
01:41:15,636 --> 01:41:18,537
Someone must stop this.

779
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:23,369
Let it be me.

780
01:41:25,146 --> 01:41:26,977
Bless me, mother...

781
01:41:28,149 --> 01:41:32,483
...so I may ease his pain and
help him forget...

782
01:41:34,822 --> 01:41:37,188
...Take care of him, child.

783
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:44,597
He's a noble soul.
See what he's done for us...

784
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:47,124
...The entire village is here
to thank him.

785
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:51,004
He has returned our land.

786
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,671
Long live King Harshwardhan.

787
01:41:55,709 --> 01:41:57,540
Long live...
...King Harshwardhan!

788
01:41:57,845 --> 01:42:00,177
Long live King Harshwardhan!

789
01:42:05,052 --> 01:42:08,021
I have returned your land
for selfish reasons.

790
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:14,460
I want to make my father proud.

791
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,964
Today with all of you as my witness...

792
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:22,966
...I hereby acknowledge Eklavya
as my father.

793
01:42:33,013 --> 01:42:33,980
Son.

794
01:42:38,786 --> 01:42:39,753
Father.

795
01:43:08,716 --> 01:43:12,152
Why are the police here?
- To arrest me.

796
01:43:13,053 --> 01:43:17,513
It's time to pay for the two men
I executed.

797
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,963
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

798
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:26,529
I am ready. Let's go...
- One moment.

799
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:31,130
Today, we searched
Udaywardhan's room...

800
01:43:32,006 --> 01:43:34,975
...and in the D VD case,
found a suicide note.

801
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:36,977
Bablu...

802
01:43:41,749 --> 01:43:42,977
Take a look.

803
01:43:45,753 --> 01:43:48,586
It's a royal mess.

804
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:52,556
They knew I was closing in on them.
So they took the easy way out...

805
01:43:53,027 --> 01:43:56,394
...and jumped in front of
a running train. Suicide.

806
01:43:58,098 --> 01:44:00,999
Too bad.
Escaped my clutches after all.

807
01:44:02,036 --> 01:44:04,004
I would never have spared them.
Sir, good handwriting, no?

808
01:44:16,183 --> 01:44:17,172
Good.

809
01:44:18,652 --> 01:44:19,619
Very good!

810
01:44:21,188 --> 01:44:22,951
Isn't it, Father?
