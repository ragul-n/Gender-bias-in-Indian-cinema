3
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,160
- It's my turn.
- No, it's mine.

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,440
- Go to hell.
- You go to hell, and your husband.

5
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,870
Fighting this early
in the morning.

6
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,800
Don't interfere.

7
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,730
Move! Move!

8
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,260
Neither you, nor you...
I'll fill my bucket first.

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,850
What witch owns this bucket?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,760
Control your tongue,
Ganga behen (sister).

11
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,050
You dare call me your sister. Unlike you,
she's not a servant at some seth's.

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,130
Take your bucket, and get lost!!

13
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,800
She thinks it's her father's tap.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,260
She's such a nuisance here.

15
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,990
Busy people wait.
The jobless line up first.

16
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,250
I'll see how she gets first.
I'll fill up first. Next, Radha.

17
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,240
Kashi, then you.
Jamuna, you're next.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,570
- How dare you? Did you all see?
- Control your tongue...

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,470
lest I raise my hands against you.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,690
Stop laughing. She'll throw
your bucket, too.

21
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,960
What a comparison!
She, a lowly servant, and I a queen.

22
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,520
No comparison.
Who'd want to... with you?

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,170
- Is one able to?
- Ganga!!

24
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,310
Leave my arm.

25
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,380
What has the world come to?

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,070
Leaves in the morning, all dressed up.
Returns at night with money.

27
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,570
- Such a husband should drown himself.
- Who are you blessing this early, dear?

28
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,890
My parents.

29
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,110
- What happened? - Do you care?
Hiding your face here like a woman.

30
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,670
My dear, instead of me, it's enough
that you show your muscles.

31
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,090
Wrapped up in your shroud,
you sleep till noon.

32
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,840
Has that witch Paro's husband
influenced you? Get up.

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,110
Hari om...
Oh, my ears.

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,910
When will you bathe, eat,
and leave for the mill?

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,790
Do you want to be
fired from the mill?

36
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,890
I can leave the mill,
but not your heart.

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,190
How gentle your heart is.

38
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,990
See! Now you woke
my darling boy up.

39
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,900
Can't praise your darling boy enough.

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,770
He's one in a thousand.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,710
Curse on you! Can't you say,
he's one in a million?

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,480
Get lost!
Go to the mill.

43
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,640
My darling boy has to bathe.

44
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,610
Tell him to bathe
at the tap outside.

45
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,920
No. People will cast their
evil eyes on him.

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,510
Yes, father. True.

47
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,710
I'll bathe right here.

48
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,390
Bless you my son.

49
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,360
One day you both will definitely
bathe me in Ganga waters.

50
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,220
What did father say?

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,160
Your father came home late.

52
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,470
- Don't wake him up.
- Actually, his luck should wake up.

53
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,770
Right, mother?

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,400
Come on, get up.
I'll get the food ready for you.

55
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,670
Okay. I'll be ready soon, too.

56
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,970
Mother, hurry up. It's late.
I must go.

57
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,810
What have you served?
Vegetables, roti, and onion.

58
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,300
One more onion.

59
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,420
Ma, can you give one more roti?

60
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,810
For my friend Ramu.

61
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,580
He's an orphan.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,120
Come with me to the stairs.

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,240
- Why?
- So that my day passes by well.

64
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,070
Bansi, be careful on the way.

65
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,720
Yes, ma. I will.

66
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,830
Ta ta.
(Rhymes with 'chaanta').

67
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,440
English went away,
but left chaanta (slap) behind.

68
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,140
Shoeshine boys have
an attitude these days.

69
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,630
He shines shoes...
doesn't pick pockets.

70
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,720
Don't you dare talk
nonsense about us.

71
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,240
Oh ho!! Oh Jamuna!

72
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,350
It's now forbidden to speak
the truth in this chaal.

73
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,390
Should a shoeshiner
be called a king now?

74
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,070
Are you satisfied
with your shouting?

75
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,450
Can't sleep all night. Early morning
when I can, you start off.

76
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,140
Have you lost all
reverence for God?

77
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,290
Reverence? Why should I revere him?

78
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,970
What has he given us?

79
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,590
Even when I do, does he
fill our coffers with treasure?

80
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,530
And you keep shouting
from morning till evening.

81
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,290
Do you get enough to eat?

82
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,710
You talk such nonsense.

83
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,690
I talk sense.
Your God has none.

84
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,230
- You're so devoted, and yet?
- So What?

85
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,890
It's the result of one's karma.

86
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,810
Is it? Then why
do you waste time praying?

87
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,670
- What has God given you?
- What hasn't he?

88
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,190
A lovely husband and son.

89
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,380
Oh, Shankar!

90
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,840
Girdhari bhai.

91
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,970
Did you go
to the factory in Kalyan?

92
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,960
I did, but it was of no use.

93
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,800
- Why? - Don't they need men?
- Stop talking nonsense?

94
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,796
I'm coming!

95
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,140
My dear, I'm coming.

96
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,670
Don't worry,
I'll speak to another man.

97
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,770
This useless stove.

98
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,830
Your father brings such wet wood.

99
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,920
Ma.

100
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,430
When father comes,
hit his head with it.

101
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,600
What an intelligent
mother's boy he is.

102
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,700
A pity his father isn't.

103
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,360
Talking with every and any one.

104
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,206
If you talk to him again, then...

105
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,350
you'll teach me a lesson, right?

106
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,810
My dear, Shankar's also a human...

107
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,310
- not a demon to possess one.
- Age hasn't given you any sense.

108
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,220
Aren't you ashamed of talking
to that shameless man?

109
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,270
His life's easy,
while his wife and son earn.

110
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,970
What do we have in common?

111
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,110
Now quickly light the
fire and make tea.

112
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,960
No, Ma.

113
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,790
You light the fire.

114
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,110
Father will become
a horse for me to ride.

115
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,590
A horse? It's time
to go to work, you donkey.

116
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,666
You made him cry
over a triviality.

117
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,550
You wasted time talking
to that worthless man.

118
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,240
Come on. Humor him.

119
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,720
But, how to become a horse, dear?

120
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,460
- Then become a donkey.
- Quiet!

121
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,300
Come on. For a short time.

122
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,790
Behen, Ganga!!

123
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,250
Coming.

124
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,070
Father is a donkey!
Father is a donkey!

125
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,150
Here, have a bidi (Indian cigarettes).

126
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,940
No.

127
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,630
Why? Please have one?

128
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,190
Okay, give.

129
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,090
- Why not? You buy food too.
- The food is ready.

130
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,870
- Eat it when you are hungry.
- Yes. I will

131
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,160
Oh, Jamuna.

132
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,310
You know the song
from that famous film?

133
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,420
She's going to meet her beloved.

134
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,099
I'm dancing on my own.

135
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,220
But the cursed world has husbands
dancing to their tune.

136
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,340
Or else why would one dress up
to go wash dirty utensils?

137
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,530
- Ganga!
- I'm not taking your name.

138
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,220
I'm talking about the world.

139
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,250
Namaste.

140
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,900
He came to the feast yesterday.

141
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,990
- The singer of religious hymns?
- Yes.

142
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,480
Thank you for your wishes.

143
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,230
- Do it well.
- Yes.

144
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,330
This is okay.

145
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,560
- Good day.
- Good day.

146
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,530
Oh, Shankar!

147
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,250
Where are you going?

148
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,580
Come here. Why don't you
help to make Raavan?

149
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,460
Every year it is you who make it.

150
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,340
I'm wandering jobless
for a year now.

151
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,300
- What? You don't have a job?
- No.

152
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,440
- Oh, then go on. Look for one.
- Alright.

153
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,490
Oh Pundit!
The poor man is jobless.

154
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,300
So what?

155
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,300
His wife earns.

156
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,860
What are you saying, Pundit?

157
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,520
Translate this into Hindi, please.

158
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,370
Destiny. Even God doesn't know it.

159
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,290
Do you think, you would?

160
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,310
Why aren't you washing the utensils?

161
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,270
How will I cook?

162
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,110
Don't shout, I'll do them now.
Soak the rice first.

163
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,990
I know you well.
The lady has spoiled you.

164
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,560
I'll see that you are sacked.

165
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,270
Boot, slippers, or sandals

166
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,450
For men or women

167
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,740
They all cost one anna

168
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,080
Polish costs one anna

169
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,480
We ask for nothing

170
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,420
Just check out our polishing

171
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,080
We trust the one above
and are not afraid of anyone

172
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,160
We charge one anna for
brushing, cleaning, shining

173
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,130
Your shoes are clean...

174
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,530
but your heart isn't

175
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,000
Truth is suspect.
It's the era of falsehood

176
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,350
It all costs one anna

177
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,670
One feels hungry

178
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,480
We earn enough to satisfy it

179
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,930
We can't do any favors,
why do any harm

180
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,020
We work hard, then sleep well

181
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,510
No one takes their
wealth with them

182
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,350
Behen Ganga.

183
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,240
Your hands move
so efficiently still.

184
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,800
No one rolls papads like you,
for this wedding.

185
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,010
Some roll papads at home
others do it outside.

186
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,920
A woman here goes out
and rolls papad all day.

187
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,730
And her worthless husband, sits at home.

188
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,100
But how can her husband bear it?

189
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,770
Is he so shameless?

190
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,070
One has to be
to live on wife's earnings.

191
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,180
Why should I keep quiet?

192
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,630
Am I taking names?

193
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,240
If he's clever,
he'll understand.

194
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,060
What an attitude!

195
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,940
Trying to intimidate us.

196
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,980
He should intimidate his wife...

197
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,550
who visits seths under his nose.

198
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,540
But Ganga behen, it's
not the woman's fault...

199
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,260
- if the husband accepts it.
- That's what I'm saying.

200
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,800
I can't bear this.

201
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,460
But what can we do?

202
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,440
As long as the
husband's all for it.

203
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,790
What a topsy turvy world.

204
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,950
Wife earns and man sits
at home and eats.

205
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,670
It's better to take poison.

206
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,370
If Bhola's father did this,
I would give him poison.

207
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,840
Why should a man earn
when his wife does?

208
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,760
Keep your tongue under
control, Ganga behen.

209
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,380
Control your wife first.

210
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,390
Don't browbeat me.
I didn't mention any names.

211
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,690
Guilty conscience.

212
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,570
Roll the papads.

213
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,090
Parvati!

214
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,570
Bring the utensils quickly.

215
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,040
She takes hours
to wash utensils.

216
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,460
Sethaniji, sack Parvati, please.

217
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,820
She doesn't work at all.

218
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,800
The quality of pickle
increases with time.

219
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,400
But servants become
lazy with time.

220
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,250
You're right maharaj (cook).

221
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,500
Parvati has worked
only a year, for us.

222
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,750
And you longer.

223
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,220
She's fainted!
What happened, Paro?

224
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,700
She's really fainted.

225
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,120
- She's had an attack!
- What attack, Sethani?

226
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,640
It is an attack of laziness.

227
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,890
She's pretending, because
she broke the china.

228
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,090
Keep quiet maharaj.
You always think the worst.

229
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,210
Pick her up and take her inside.

230
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,700
Paro, wake up.

231
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,660
No, no. Stay down.

232
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,170
Maharaj, quickly bring hot milk.

233
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,880
What are you doing,
crazy woman? Lie down.

234
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,820
Are you feeling better?

235
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,190
What happened to you?

236
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,860
I felt dizzy.

237
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,370
Sethaniji...

238
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,640
- I've broken some dishes, forgive me.
- It doesn't matter.

239
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,450
Don't cry. Wait.

240
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,690
- I'll call the doctor.
- No, no, Sethaniji.

241
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,450
No need to call a doctor.

242
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,460
One does feel dizzy when pregnant.

243
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,490
You are pregnant?

244
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,540
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

245
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,840
You shouldn't be working
in your delicate condition.

246
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,130
- If I don't work what will we eat?
- Why?

247
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,340
Your husband must
be earning too?

248
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,370
How to tell you Sethaniji?

249
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,150
For a year he has been jobless.

250
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,030
He can't find a job
in this big city?

251
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,070
He's not trained
for the work he gets.

252
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,980
And he doesn't get
what he's trained for.

253
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,460
What's he trained for?

254
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,290
He's a highly skilled craftsman.

255
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,240
He's a carpenter.
Does anything with wood.

256
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,880
There might be only
two or four like him in Mumbai.

257
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,920
And only one fool
like you in Bombay.

258
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,110
We need people with such skills.

259
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,590
We have a very large
furniture factory.

260
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,660
There are 200 workmen.

261
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,160
- He can be one of them.
- Milk!

262
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,670
Here, drink the milk.

263
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,470
I'll phone seth right now.

264
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,560
What did you say?

265
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,080
We haven't received
the tender yet?

266
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,050
I'll see to it.

267
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,376
What is it, Murari?

268
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,260
Sir, we have a lot of work,
but not enough workers.

269
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,620
If you agree, we can get
three or four more people.

270
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,530
Are 200 workers not enough?

271
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,490
Sir, not enough workers
of the type we need.

272
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:37,790
- What do you mean? - With more people,
by Diwali the order can be completed.

273
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,660
One by one you've
increased the number.

274
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,790
Hire one more man.

275
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,470
Yes?

276
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,780
You know our Parvati?

277
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,790
Who works at home?

278
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,910
She's pregnant.

279
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,450
The poor woman's husband
has no job.

280
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,880
Give him a job in our factory.

281
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,580
Send him with a letter.

282
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,320
You need a man, don't you?

283
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,800
There's no need now, sir.
I'll manage.

284
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,610
No, a man will come
with Sethaniji's letter, tomorrow.

285
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,520
- Hire him.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,850
Ram Dayal!

287
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,630
I couldn't do what you wanted, Pundit.

288
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,330
Sethani has recommended
someone for the job.

289
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,100
Here, take your money back.

290
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,520
Keep it. If not today,
then some other day.

291
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,590
Courage will bear fruit.

292
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,180
No fear while you're there.

293
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,880
Okay.

294
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,910
Here's the letter.

295
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,360
For your husband.

296
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,370
Tell him to go
to the factory tomorrow morning.

297
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,370
Seth has promised to employ him.

298
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,620
Sethaniji, you've
made our lives.

299
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,970
He'll be very happy
to get the job.

300
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,290
Now we'll have a home.

301
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,340
I'll never forget your kindness.

302
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,980
May God keep you happy, Sethaniji.

303
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,790
Now don't work too hard.

304
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,220
Shankar! Did you find a job?

305
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,336
No, brother. My luck is unfavorable.

306
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,260
- Not many have your luck.
- What do you mean?

307
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,400
Your boy earns, and pundit says...
Come here pundit.

308
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,840
You have kept your wife at Sethji's.

309
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,120
What did you say, pundit?

310
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,770
- Doesn't she work there?
- You said 'kept there'.

311
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,890
It's the same.
Let it be.

312
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,520
- Get out of here!
- Leave it, Shankar. Go home.

313
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,370
- I won't spare him.
- Go home.

314
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,366
Come on, work fast.

315
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,390
(Children playing kabaddi)

316
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,556
- You're out!
- No, Bhola, you're out.

317
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,720
You couldn't hold your breath.

318
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,590
Instead of agreeing, you're fighting.

319
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,880
Such a crybaby.

320
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,330
Such a sissy.
Wear a skirt and blouse.

321
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,580
Girl? So what?

322
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,710
Go out! Go out!

323
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,556
I won't.

324
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,470
No one dare tell me to go out.

325
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,180
Is this your father's property?

326
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,020
Don't talk of my father.

327
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,550
- I'll kill you.
- I'll bite you.

328
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,550
I'm dead. I'm dead.

329
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,760
Why should you?
Worthless's son will die.

330
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,346
Oh Ganga!!

331
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,396
Oh Radha. Anybody!

332
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,130
What happened?

333
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,100
Don't ask. Can't you see?

334
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,020
Look. He beat him so badly.

335
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,160
That pauper's son.

336
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,390
Don't just stand there.
Call the police, someone.

337
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,680
Today he beat my child.
Tomorrow he'll beat yours.

338
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,870
Then he'll beat up
all the children in the world.

339
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,730
Yes, he'll beat up the children.

340
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,280
Ganga's now possessed with Devi.

341
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,010
Bring kumkum (red powder).

342
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,220
She's a wicked woman.

343
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,570
Don't you dare
bad mouth my mother.

344
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,090
You dare oppose the devi?

345
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,910
Ask her where you
lost your ring.

346
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,840
Devi, I've lost my ring.

347
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,370
Where is it?

348
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,050
Put the kumkum.

349
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,040
- The ring!
- Devi! Devi!

350
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,730
The ring!

351
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,390
Gold ring?

352
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,120
Yes. It's gold.

353
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,900
It's right here.

354
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,880
In this chaal.

355
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,220
It's in someone's home.

356
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,920
Devi, tell the name.

357
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,300
Paro.

358
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,320
She's telling a lie.

359
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,650
My mother's not a thief.
She's the real devi.

360
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,190
She's an evil woman.

361
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:29,320
If you're a real devi, tell us,
is he a boy or a monkey.

362
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,930
Your mother's a monkey.

363
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,650
What happened? What's going on?

364
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,630
Ask your son what happened.

365
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,470
He's made mincemeat of my son.

366
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,930
You can't control your son,
and live on your wife's earnings.

367
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,820
Come.

368
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,780
Go!
Don't just stand around.

369
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,860
Call the police.

370
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,960
Get in. Scoundrel.

371
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,070
You misbehave, but she insults me.

372
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,500
- Just listen bapu.
- Quiet!

373
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,900
Why were you playing with him?
You've been told not to.

374
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,000
- He started it.
- Liar!

375
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,180
It's become difficult to live here.

376
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,530
What's the matter with you?
Why did you hit him?

377
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,480
He forgets himself and gets
entangled with the rich.

378
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,850
I'll teach you a lesson
for hitting Bhola.

379
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,120
- That's enough.
- Enough?

380
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,280
Because of him I was
insulted by Bhola's mother.

381
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,830
So you hit him
because of that witch?

382
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,650
- Is she lying?
- Then what?

383
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,540
- You believed her?
- Just be quiet.

384
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,080
Leave him.

385
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,220
Don't take out your
frustration on him.

386
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,430
- What are you saying?
- The right thing.

387
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,950
Poor boy works hard all day.

388
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,460
You too.
I'm the worthless one.

389
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,250
Is that what you mean?

390
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,930
- Listen.
- That's enough.

391
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,450
Don't cry, son.

392
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,940
For you, I quarrelled with your father.

393
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,870
That wasn't good.

394
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,580
Couple of slaps would've been better
than his going away in anger.

395
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,290
Don't know when he'll be back.

396
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,930
Don't worry son.

397
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,250
Bansi? Why did you hit Bhola?

398
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,170
Ma, I didn't hit him.

399
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,590
It's not my fault. He bit me.

400
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,140
That looks bad.

401
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,600
Come. I'll put oil on it.

402
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,420
His teeth should've broken.

403
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,970
Ma, if you say, I'll break
them all tomorrow.

404
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,640
Don't you dare talk like that.

405
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,950
I'll spank you.
Why do you play with him?

406
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,440
He cries like a girl if I don't.

407
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,680
And bites like a dog when I do.

408
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,370
Go and wash.

409
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,500
I'll get food for you.

410
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,250
Be quiet now.
Everyone's heard you.

411
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,490
- Have they?
- Yes.

412
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,010
- Shall I stop?
- Yes. Enough.

413
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,840
How could MY son
lose in the fight?

414
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,530
Aren't you ashamed?

415
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:11,770
How can your son lose, ma?

416
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,390
I bit his hand, hard.

417
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,870
Like this.

418
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,320
So hard?

419
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,030
- After all, whose son are you?
- Yours.

420
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,260
Bravo! Now I'll serve
my darling son some halwa.

421
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,560
I don't want halwa.

422
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,850
- I want...
- bhajjiya?

423
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,040
I'll make it at once.

424
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,530
Ma, a foot massage is logical.

425
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,370
Feet get tired while walking.

426
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,590
But why massage my hands?

427
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,070
Hands must also get tired
polishing shoes whole day?

428
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,860
You're so innocent, ma.

429
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,280
I don't polish with my hands.

430
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,430
I use a brush.

431
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,600
Ma, you use hands to wash dishes.
They must be tired.

432
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,080
Come, I'll massage them.

433
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,290
I, too, don't scrub with my hands.

434
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,460
I use coir.

435
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,090
Really?

436
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,050
It's 9 o'clock, ma.

437
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,510
Father hasn't returned yet.

438
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,310
He'll return when his anger subsides.

439
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,660
Have sweets.

440
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,710
Speak softly or else
my wife will nag me.

441
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,830
Is everything Okay?

442
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:57,280
Why this two-fold music today?

443
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,870
Say something.

444
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,530
Bhola, you tell.

445
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,590
Mother knows.

446
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,260
Why are we crying, mother?

447
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,580
If something happens
to me, Bhola...

448
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,160
who'll look after you?

449
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,140
Yes. Father, who'll look after me?

450
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,780
First let her die.

451
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,420
Then I'll manage.

452
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,620
You want me to die?

453
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,970
My son was beaten black and blue.

454
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,870
Show him your head, son.

455
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,636
Ma, not the head.
He slapped me.

456
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,610
Then show your face.

457
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,430
- See father.
- Did you see?

458
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,610
His face is red.

459
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,110
The face is red from eating halwa.
Not from slaps.

460
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,400
Alright, now leave
children's fights alone.

461
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,540
Children's fight?
If I hadn't reached in time...

462
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,070
he'd have been killed.

463
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,520
Don't just stand there.
Call the police.

464
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,130
Get Bansi handcuffed.

465
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,580
Ma, I bit his hand hard.

466
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,580
How can he be handcuffed now?

467
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,060
Have you heard?
It's your darling's fault.

468
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,790
Let children's fights alone.
Give me food.

469
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,870
I didn't cook today.

470
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,856
I made halwa.

471
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,720
So, I'll have halwa.

472
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,490
One needs a personality
to eat halwa.

473
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,060
So that's why you're eating it?
Live long.

474
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:30,900
We'll live. Death should come
to Shankar's family.

475
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,630
Stop cursing the poor family.

476
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,740
- Give me my meal now.
- Cook it yourself.

477
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,410
- Let's go, Bholu.
- Yes.

478
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,800
Long live my devoted son.

479
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,080
I was warned not to marry
during the shradh period.

480
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:55,880
The washerman was asked about
his unfairness to his wife.

481
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,960
He said...

482
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,950
a woman's character
should be upright.

483
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,040
My wife's got a bad name.

484
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,160
The neighbors call her loose.

485
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,330
I'm forced to throw
her out of the house.

486
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,300
Hearing this, Lord Ram
became thoughtful.

487
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,790
You are so late.

488
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,630
Food is ready.

489
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,560
Come and have it.

490
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,020
I don't want to.

491
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,200
Why not?

492
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,780
You haven't eaten since morning.

493
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,240
I'm not hungry.

494
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,260
Please have your meal.

495
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,740
Don't be stubborn. Come.

496
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,720
One shouldn't take out
one's anger on food.

497
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,860
God gets angry.

498
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,040
What does your God do?

499
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,800
He's made a young worthless man
eat his wife's earnings.

500
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,860
The same thing again?

501
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,810
You were feeding us till now.

502
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,330
It doesn't matter if now I do.

503
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,970
From tomorrow...

504
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,130
What... from tomorrow?

505
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,570
First eat, then I'll tell you.

506
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,520
First tell me, then I'll eat.

507
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,470
Beginning tomorrow, you have a new job.

508
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,830
- Where?
- Where I work.

509
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,820
At that seth's.

510
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,160
- I get it.
- They have a big factory.

511
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,870
I'll die, but not work there.

512
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,206
You won't work?

513
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,270
- Why not?
- Who do you think I am?

514
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,060
I'm a decent man.

515
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,750
I'll die, but not stoop.

516
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,850
What a respectable job it is.

517
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,030
I make the bed while you
massage Seth's feet.

518
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,340
Are you crazy?

519
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,540
Where was your pallu when you
begged Seth for the job?

520
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,220
What are you saying?

521
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,150
What everyone is saying.
I didn't believe them. I trusted you.

522
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,990
Now I know it's the opposite.

523
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,299
Aren't you ashamed
to talk like that?

524
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,020
You should be ashamed
for deceiving your husband.

525
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,859
I don't want to hear
anything more.

526
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,780
Is this what I get?

527
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,430
Is this the fruit of all I do?

528
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,060
For this day you married me?

529
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,130
Don't shed crocodile tears.

530
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,670
I know you well.

531
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,550
Strangle me before accusing me.

532
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,300
Why don't you kill me?

533
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,000
Similar injustice has always
been meted out to women.

534
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,970
Raja Nal left Damayanti.

535
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:13,940
What was Ahiliya's fault that
Gautam's curse turned her to stone?

536
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,210
She was redeemed only when...

537
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,570
the feet of Ram,
who was unjust to Sita.

538
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,160
All because of a washerman...

539
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,100
he abandoned a pregnant Sita.

540
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,540
Laxman took her to the forest...

541
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,330
and he told her Ram's wishes.

542
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,600
Lord Ram has abandoned you.

543
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,580
Because she was impure?

544
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,890
Sita couldn't hear this. She swooned
and fell to the ground.

545
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,540
My Ram is not happy with me

546
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,340
He gave his Sita...

547
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,350
the name - impure.

548
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:51,210
By what means, brother Laxman...

549
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,980
should I make him see?

550
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,550
He said...

551
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,730
carry out your deeds...

552
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:15,050
till the earth takes you

553
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,990
While dying...

554
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:34,310
Ram's name should be on the lips

555
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,830
Why would Sita live after hearing...

556
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,130
such words from Ram?

557
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,850
She had to

558
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,270
She was pregnant

559
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:47,810
She would bear it...

560
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,770
for the sake of the child

561
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,410
Paro.

562
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,530
Say something.

563
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,710
What should I say?

564
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,600
I should have died
before what you said.

565
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,260
I should die of shame
for saying those things.

566
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,230
I should be the one to die.

567
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,200
I know my fault
can't be forgiven.

568
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,520
I won't face you.
I'll go away.

569
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,500
- Where will you go?
- Anywhere, Paro.

570
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,826
I'm giving you and Bansi
much pain and hurt.

571
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,350
But...

572
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,240
It's not your fault.

573
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,410
It's our neighbor's fault.
They provoke you to anger.

574
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,350
Honestly, I'm innocent.

575
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,880
I know Paro.

576
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,170
I'm guilty of having
a very bad temper.

577
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,730
I try so hard
to control it... but...

578
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,630
You won't get angry
if I say something?

579
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,980
I won't, Paro.

580
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Speak what's in your heart.
I'll listen quietly.

581
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,420
I know you are good hearted.

582
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,210
But your temper
is of equal intensity.

583
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,330
Today you hit Bansi unnecessarily.

584
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,400
It wasn't his fault at all.

585
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,610
It was Bhola who bit him.

586
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,830
Then why didn't he...?
See, I'm getting angry again.

587
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,640
The idiot should have told me.

588
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,930
Do you ever listen?

589
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,630
You didn't listen to me either.

590
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,820
Let alone speaking with Sethji.
I've never even seen him.

591
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,440
I spoke to Sethani.

592
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,720
They have a very
big furniture factory.

593
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,810
She's very kind.

594
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,150
Today I felt dizzy while working.
She looked after me.

595
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,140
You didn't tell me.
I'll take you to the doctor tomorrow.

596
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,260
This is a good illness.

597
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,730
- Is illness good?
- Sometimes.

598
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,840
Sometimes?

599
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,940
- You didn't understand?
- No.

600
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,940
We are getting a visitor.

601
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,720
You're pretending illness
because of our penniless state.

602
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,600
Don't fear. Who is it?
I'll write to say, "Don't come brother."

603
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,880
No, not brother. Son.

604
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,090
Whose son?

605
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,700
Now I feel dizzy.
Now I get it.

606
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:49,540
- Your God should know better.
- Don't talk like that.

607
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,120
People come with their own destiny.

608
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,770
And I hit you in your condition.

609
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,430
Why didn't these hands break?

610
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,730
Angry again? These hands
are the wealth of my craftsman.

611
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,630
Now will you go with the letter?

612
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,240
- I'll go right now.
- At night.

613
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,900
Oh, they'll think I'm crazy.

614
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,650
- Are you happy now?
- Yes, Paro. Very.

615
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,070
- Come and eat.
- No, no.

616
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,420
Why not?
You haven't eaten at all.

617
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,060
First feed your visitor.
Then I'll eat.

618
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,050
Get up son.

619
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,870
Hurry up! Seth saab
will be here soon.

620
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,010
- What are you doing there?
- Hurry up! Pull this rope.

621
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,160
Hey. Where are you going?

622
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,680
- I've to meet the seth.
- He's not here. Go away.

623
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,290
- Isn't that the seth?
- No, he's the manager.

624
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:51,380
Let him come chowkidar (watchman).

625
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,490
I've brought a letter from Sethaniji.

626
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,410
So you are that craftsman?

627
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,790
Such craftiness. Pandu,
get a chair for saab.

628
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,420
I've come for a job.

629
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:17,070
Yes, you'll get one,
or else I'll lose mine.

630
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,810
You'll get Rs 7 per day.

631
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:24,800
Come tomorrow at 7 sharp,
with your tools.

632
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,220
The factory has tools,
I'm sure, saab.

633
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:33,250
You're employed temporarily.
Understood?

634
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:36,850
But, I don't have any tools.

635
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:42,850
That you don't have tools
is not my responsibility.

636
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,820
- I have Sethaniji's letter.
- So what can I do?

637
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:53,750
The letter says to give you a job.
Not tools, sweets, halwa, bed and all.

638
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,430
Sethji has arrived. Move.

639
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,940
- Is everything ready for the pooja?
- Yes ji. Everything's ready.

640
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:11,550
Sir, this is the new worker.

641
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,760
- I've brought Sethaniji's letter.
- Yes, we know.

642
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,950
Sir, I've asked him
to start work tomorrow.

643
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,630
That's good.

644
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,090
You shouldn't follow your superiors.

645
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,570
I've told you to come
tomorrow with your tools.

646
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,800
- Or else... Pandu...
- No, no. I'll come with my tools.

647
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,070
Hey. Don't touch the car.
Go away.

648
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:42,710
Why suggest such workers?
Come to work, too, Pandu.

649
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,240
Do you have a beedi, Paro?

650
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,040
Didn't you get the job?

651
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,800
- I did. Rs 7 per day. But...
- Rs 7 per day?

652
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,890
But why aren't you smiling?

653
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,330
How to smile? I need Rs 70.

654
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,570
Rs 70? What for?

655
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,460
Don't I need tools?
We sold all ours.

656
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,510
- So there they...
- Yes, Paro. No work without tools.

657
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:37,830
It's my fault.
You sold for my illness.

658
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,940
Don't say that.
It was for you.

659
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,190
But, what now?

660
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,010
Nothing. Found, and lost
a job. That's all.

661
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,980
We can't lose this chance.
Somehow you should get this job.

662
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:55,630
I know it's important.
Especially for you...

663
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,370
Selling the house won't even yield 70p.
How to get Rs 70?

664
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,210
Why don't you borrow from a friend?

665
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,800
Together we'll pay back the debt.

666
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,590
No one befriends a pauper.

667
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,010
Only another pauper does.

668
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:18,490
Just try. God will show the way.

669
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,120
- I'll go for you. Not for God.
- Okay.

670
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,350
Give me a beedi.

671
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,960
- I've got a job, Rs 7 per day.
- That's good news. After so long.

672
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,810
- I need a favor.
- Yes?

673
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,460
Can you lend me Rs 70 to buy tools?

674
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,320
I've just lent
Rs 150 to a friend.

675
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,950
Had you come
5 minutes earlier...

676
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,030
Doesn't matter Kishan bhaiya.
My bad luck.

677
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,860
I'm sure you'll pay
the debt in one month.

678
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,310
But the future is uncertain.

679
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,710
Kallu borrowed Rs 50.
Poor man. He died the next day.

680
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,800
Who'll pay his debt now?

681
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,560
Anything else, I can do?

682
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,820
Never mind.

683
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:21,050
Sethji, I'm asking for Rs 75 only.

684
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:26,490
Here it's a give and take system.

685
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,810
What can you sell
or deposit for it?

686
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,900
I've always paid my
debts with the interest.

687
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,540
Interest, I'll take.
But the deposit?

688
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,740
Lend me on trust.

689
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:48,040
We trust only the deposit.

690
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,400
- I've nothing to give you as security.
- What's this?

691
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,210
Give it. I'll give you
the money at once.

692
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,860
This is brass, and glass. Will it do?

693
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,290
Nothing but gold.
Understand?

694
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,720
- So shall I go away disappointed?
- No. Why?

695
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,020
You are our customer.
Have papad before you go.

696
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:32,220
Youth never comes back.

697
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:39,950
Why to cry over spilled milk?

698
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,480
Youth is crazy.

699
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,130
Falters at every step,
yet doesn't learn.

700
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,650
Girdhari brother.

701
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,120
- Who is it?
- Shankar.

702
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,750
Oh Shankar? Come in.
Why are you standing outside?

703
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,680
I was just blackening
the face of old age.

704
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,020
- What can I do?
- I've got a job. Rs 7 per day.

705
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,060
Great! Congratulations.

706
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:25,960
But I need Rs 70 for tools.
I didn't get them from anywhere.

707
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,450
If I don't get them,
I'll lose the job.

708
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:34,150
- You'll lose the job? Rs 70?
Never mind.

709
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,580
I was just thinking,
how to take out Rs 70.

710
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,860
Fortunately you came
when I'm alone.

711
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,800
Sit down. I'll give you Rs 70.

712
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,510
You'll get Rs 70 right away.

713
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:03,020
If friends don't help,
what use is friendship?

714
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:10,450
It's good your
bhabi (sis-in-law)'s not home.

715
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:17,650
She would have insulted you,
and sent you away.

716
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,000
Here.

717
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,840
Aren't you ashamed of stealing?

718
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,480
Money doesn't grow on
trees to hand it out freely.

719
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,790
I'll pay it back.

720
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:43,420
You'll pay back?! A man
living off his wife's earnings.

721
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,370
Watch his attitude.

722
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:25,390
- Didn't get anything?
- Of course I got some things.

723
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,260
I got insults, taunts, was badmouthed.
I should have drowned myself.

724
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,520
No one helps a pauper.

725
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,300
Don't utter inauspicious words
on Dussehra.

726
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:35,730
What's auspicious or inauspicious?

727
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,370
It's one's duty to try.

728
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,240
And your God makes
all attempts futile.

729
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,090
Why did you marry a penniless man?

730
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:47,500
Parvati also married Bholenath (Shiv).

731
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,260
- I'm fortunate to have you.
- Great fortune indeed.

732
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,840
No one is ready to lend me
even Rs 10. People avoid the poor.

733
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:03,720
A wife won't do that.
Today I'll help you.

734
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:07,760
Paro, I know you help me.
Even with a job.

735
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,526
But where'll you get the tools from?

736
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:10,946
You'll get them.

737
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,370
From where?

738
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,420
I have something. Sell it.

739
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,270
What do you have?

740
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,520
I've sold everything.
There's nothing left.

741
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,280
I have this Mangalsutra.
(wedding necklace)

742
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:33,480
- It has gold to buy the tools.
- Are you crazy?

743
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,350
How can I sell this?

744
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,120
This is only a symbol.
You are the real thing.

745
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,260
Sell it.

746
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,890
How's it possible?
No, I can't commit this sin.

747
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,070
It's not a sin.

748
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,690
If God drowns,
no use saving his headgear.

749
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,250
I'm doing this for you.

750
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,620
Paro, you...

751
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,920
Don't feel bad. Raja Harishchandra
sold his wife and child.

752
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,720
You're selling only a piece of jewelry.

753
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,000
That too, to earn a living.

754
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,790
Okay. Give it.

755
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,750
How can I?

756
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,850
You tied it. You take it off.

757
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,090
Tie this black thread instead.

758
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,620
God preserve us.

759
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,650
I'm a new bride again.

760
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:13,780
Bansi. Look, how many
tools I've bought.

761
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,150
What are you doing there?
Come and see.

762
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,650
Father, did you buy all this?

763
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,360
No, I sold it.

764
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,130
Father, I too will buy my
stuff for shoe polishing.

765
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,780
- What will you buy?
- No, I'll sell.

766
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,180
I don't need it anymore.

767
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,570
- Father will earn, I'll relax.
- That's not right.

768
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,460
You'll go to school.
Become an Engineer.

769
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,170
- I won't become an Engineer.
- No?

770
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,270
Mother! I want to become
a municipality officer.

771
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,810
You heard father? Then I won't remove
any worker from the footpath.

772
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,170
Thank God for laughter
in our home.

773
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,640
And on this holy Dussehra day
a craftsman regained his tools.

774
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,450
Give, I'll sharpen it.

775
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,780
- No, first I'll worship it.
- Do you think it's God?

776
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:07,376
Don't laugh. Yes.

777
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,840
Whatever brings happiness
is worth worshipping.

778
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:12,830
Is that so, ma? Then
do puja of my tools too.

779
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:16,820
Does one worship
shoe polishing stuff?

780
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:20,830
Father, cleaning shoes helped
to clear the grocer's debt.

781
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,570
Go on. Put it back.

782
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,800
- You've returned?
- Were you dreaming?

783
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,890
- I'll get the aarti.
- She was dreaming.

784
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,660
Can't give anything right
now, Paro. I'm broke.

785
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,350
Take this gold
(shami leaf - given at Dussehra).

786
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,900
This is more than
diamonds and pearls.

787
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:27,120
- But now I have a job...
- Here, sweeten your mouth.

788
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,010
I'll go meet the
people of the chaal.

789
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,710
- Ma.
- My dear, we are home.

790
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:48,350
Where'd you disappear? I've
been waiting so long to do the aarti.

791
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,250
- Father, aarti for what?
- To do. Don't you see?

792
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:57,340
Here, hold the gold branches.

793
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:02,970
Ma. We've brought so many.
They'll last several years.

794
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:05,010
What? Again this grass
and leaf stuff?

795
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:09,180
A few grams of real gold
wouldn't have bankrupted you.

796
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:14,460
My father used to give my mother
120 grams of gold on Dussehra.

797
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:17,830
But he gave only 24 grams
at our wedding

798
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,820
Did you expect an airplane?

799
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,720
The amount is equal to
the person's value.

800
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:28,070
Yes father. Understood?

801
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:32,770
At Bhola's wedding I'll take
a half kilo of gold from the girl's family.

802
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:37,320
Why half? If it depends on the groom...

803
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,760
we'll take 1 kilo.

804
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:42,966
Okay, quiet.
Let me first do the aarti.

805
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,650
First do mine.

806
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,000
First get out of shorts
and into long trousers.

807
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,820
- Sweeten your mouth.
- No need.

808
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,100
- You did that on our arrival.
- Come on. Take.

809
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,800
- I'm going now.
- Where? To loiter around?

810
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,730
No. Just want to check how
they do aarti at my friends'.

811
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,950
- Father's gone?
- Yes.

812
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:00,110
What a sharp edge!

813
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:04,140
Today your lips look
sharp (attractive) too.

814
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,340
You look happy.

815
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,500
Well, well.
Let everyone be happy.

816
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:25,590
Did you prick your finger?
Let me see.

817
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:31,250
This state of being broke
draws blood one way or another.

818
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,180
We aren't broke anymore.
You've found a job.

819
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:37,000
Yes, but the job hasn't brought
in any money yet.

820
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,230
That will also happen.

821
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:42,160
Get some new clothes
when you get paid.

822
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,920
For me or you?

823
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:46,890
For you.

824
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,760
This last one year I couldn't
get you any new clothes.

825
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:54,940
I don't have to
attend any wedding.

826
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:59,270
Our own wasn't eons ago.
You should still dress up.

827
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:03,790
I know my unemployed
state has given you pain.

828
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,580
Again?

829
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,450
Annoyed?

830
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:14,900
When women get annoyed love is
put aside, and annoyance dominates.

831
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,730
If you talk like that
I'll really get annoyed.

832
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:22,010
I know how to humor you
when you get annoyed.

833
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:26,010
Take.

834
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,940
Take off your shirt.
Let me put in a few stitches.

835
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:31,970
What can you do
about this shirt?

836
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,250
There are so many holes.

837
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:42,070
What are you looking at?

838
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:47,000
What I can't bear to.
When we got married...

839
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:51,350
your hands were like butter.
Washing utensils have made them so rough.

840
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:53,940
I won't be scrubbing
utensils any more.

841
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,920
Now I'll be the queen here.

842
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:58,810
Of course.

843
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,010
And Bansi'll be the Prince.

844
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:02,970
No more shoe-shining.

845
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:05,150
I'll admit him in a school.

846
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,650
He'll become an engineer,
and I an engineer's father.

847
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:12,826
What are you thinking?

848
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,650
It's all because of
my Giridhari's blessings.

849
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:19,860
Tomorrow when you get the job
don't forget the offering to God.

850
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,820
Why do you want to bribe god?

851
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:24,760
Don't talk like that.

852
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:29,390
With reverence take God's finger.
He'll lead you across.

853
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,590
You can hold God's finger.
I'll hold yours.

854
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,850
- Really?
- Really.

855
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,140
Okay. Then hold.

856
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:41,630
Get up.

857
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:45,720
You have to go early to work.
Go to sleep.

858
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:48,370
Alright.

859
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:01,740
I asked you to hold just my finger.
You're holding my entire hand.

860
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:06,820
- Let go. I have a lot to do.
- I know. But first get me to sleep.

861
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:15,970
Oh, you who takes
from the One who gives

862
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,220
We wake up hungry...

863
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:27,430
but He never lets us
go to bed hungry

864
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,950
Why don't you sing His praises?

865
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:06,480
The one to worry about
this world is the One...

866
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:10,310
who's the Lord of this world

867
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:22,969
Everyone does what one has to...

868
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,690
but He gives the fruit

869
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:40,150
The One whose
light is everywhere...

870
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:44,149
and yet we can't see Him

871
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:11,230
It's better to be satisfied
with the fruit of one's labor...

872
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:15,140
than to sit around doing nothing

873
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:28,200
Labor is our pilgrimage to
the four Himalayan abodes

874
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,570
Labor represents Sita and Ram

875
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:43,040
Oh you free spirit...

876
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:48,770
why don't you understand
the wisdom of Geeta?

877
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,480
What?

878
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:05,190
What's the matter with you?

879
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:11,140
- What are you looking at?
- I've already seen it, Father.

880
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,250
What have you already seen?

881
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:19,270
- Oh, you know how to laugh?
- Didn't I ever laugh earlier?

882
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,540
This last year you've
growled like a lion.

883
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,320
Now your laughter is high class.

884
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,460
- Always keep laughing.
- See how he talks.

885
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:31,490
- After all whose son are you?
- Let's shake hands.

886
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:46,330
Before going to work
sweeten your mouth.

887
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,480
Yes. It's sweet.

888
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,580
The real sweetness will be
when father gets his pay.

889
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:55,400
- You're right.
- Bapu, how much will you get?

890
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:57,100
Rs 7 daily.

891
01:11:58,290 --> 01:11:59,800
My earnings of a week?

892
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:04,930
- Of course.
- You must give a high class party.

893
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,120
- It will be done.
- Then let's shake hands.

894
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,110
- Here's your lunch.
- Mine too.

895
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:16,470
I told you yesterday No more
shoe shining. Eat at home.

896
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,980
What will my friends think?

897
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,520
Father started earning
so the son has become worthless?

898
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:26,030
Listen.

899
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:27,830
Let him go to work today.

900
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:31,160
I too have to go and explain
my job to the new servant.

901
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,680
Alright. But only today.

902
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,800
Go, get your things.

903
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:40,360
You're going to work after a long gap.

904
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,550
Don't argue with anyone.

905
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:47,000
- Promise me. - Yes father.
You're very short tempered.

906
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,060
The days of anger are over.

907
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,960
- What did you buy behen Munni?
- Potatoes and tomatoes.

908
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:58,290
Tomatoes? Mmmm...

909
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,480
Oh Kashi!

910
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:05,910
What, behen Ganga?

911
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,350
- What's to become of this world?
- Why?

912
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:11,120
All shame has disappeared
from this world.

913
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:13,790
Wife's smiling and
observing her husband.

914
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,940
Oh God! Was she smiling
at her husband?

915
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:17,840
We're also married.

916
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,360
I'm not lying, but
in the last 30 years...

917
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:23,850
not once have I
smiled at my husband.

918
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,090
Don't just stare at me.
Say well done!

919
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,556
Well done behen Ganga.

920
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,550
- How can a filthy mouth smile?
- What?

921
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,260
I have a filthy mouth?

922
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,700
- Just repeat that.
- I didn't mention any names.

923
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:43,830
Come have tea.

924
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:46,710
We'll have pani puri at Chowpatty.
I'll come to fetch you.

925
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,340
Oh dear. Pick it up.

926
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:53,650
Who's picture is this?

927
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:55,170
Is he a craftsman?

928
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:59,340
A very big one. He fought
for the country. Subhash Chandra Bose.

929
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:05,710
(March/song, associated with him)

930
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,310
Where are you going?

931
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:15,600
- To wash dishes.
- You work here?

932
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,410
- Police inspector has called you upstairs.
- Why?

933
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:20,676
- There's been a theft.
- But I didn't steal anything.

934
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,300
You'll have to come
with me anyway. Come.

935
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:35,530
Yes, Sethji.

936
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,620
I'll read out. Two lockets...

937
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:40,300
Five diamond studded rings...

938
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,760
one diamond necklace...

939
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,290
one wedding necklace...

940
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:47,020
six jhoomars, twelve armbands...

941
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:51,090
all together valued
at about one lakh, 10,000.

942
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,440
- Correct?
- Yes.

943
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,560
Anything else?

944
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:01,640
A Rolex automatic watch.

945
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:05,580
Value?

946
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,260
About 2,500.

947
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:13,580
Any other servants
apart from these?

948
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:17,220
Saab. She was entering
the house stealthily. I caught her.

949
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:19,380
Sethaniji. I've done nothing wrong.

950
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,346
Don't worry Paro.

951
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:26,260
- Who are you?
- She's our servant, Parvati.

952
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:28,290
I trust her completely.

953
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:31,880
You trust all your servants completely.

954
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,080
Who do you suspect?

955
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:36,010
I don't suspect any servant.

956
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,650
Inspector, I don't think
it's an inside job.

957
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,260
You all may go.

958
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:46,800
Do you need to ask
her anything more?

959
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,030
No.

960
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,700
Don't worry.

961
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,340
You go in. They'll do their
best to find out.

962
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:01,660
- May I ask something, Sethji?
- Yes.

963
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:05,000
Why are you standing here?

964
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:08,120
Sethaniji, today you've saved me.

965
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:11,620
- The police would've arrested me.
- Why would they?

966
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:16,210
You didn't steal anything. Go and
explain the job to the new servant.

967
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:22,190
Chaiwala. Hot tea.

968
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,910
Come here chaiwala.
A cup of tea for everyone.

969
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:29,080
- Really?
- Tea for everyone.

970
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:33,500
Bansi! What is the
celebration about?

971
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:38,370
Rehman. Bansi's father has a job now.
No more shoe-shining from tomorrow.

972
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,670
He'll go to school
from tomorrow.

973
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,740
I'll give you one.
Is it bad to study in school?

974
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:48,800
On a holiday I'll come here
and teach you all.

975
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,930
Are you joking? Look
at the way you've cleaned them.

976
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:54,670
Look at the dirt.

977
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,350
No need to shout.
From tomorrow I'm not coming.

978
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:02,980
- My husband has a job now.
- But today you have to clean them well.

979
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,890
Husband's got a job.
He can rule now.

980
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:08,160
We can get 50 servants
to replace you.

981
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:33,100
- What's your name.
- Shankar Mohite.

982
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:06,520
Come early tomorrow
morning. Understood?

983
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:15,790
- Only Rs 5?
- Take it. Take it.

984
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:21,410
How can I take it? I was
promised Rs 7. I'll report this.

985
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:24,230
Come here.

986
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,140
- A mistake.
- Take.

987
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,760
Come early tomorrow with these.

988
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:37,270
The tools?
They are my own sir.

989
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,720
Listen.

990
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:47,360
Take care of those tools.

991
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:55,010
You too, come early tomorrow.

992
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:08,270
Sethji. Just watch
the wonder of polishing.

993
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:19,060
- You've come.
- We have to go to Chowpatty.

994
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,120
Listen brothers.

995
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,600
This is my father.

996
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,010
Bless you. Be happy.

997
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,730
These are my friends.

998
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,970
They are good.
No one steals...

999
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:39,170
- or smokes or gambles.
- But we go to the cinema.

1000
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:42,290
It's not bad to
go to the cinema.

1001
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:45,610
Is my attending school
a certainty, bapu?

1002
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,160
Yes. Absolutely.

1003
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,300
- Can I give this box to Ramu?
- Yes.

1004
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:52,620
Ramu, come here.
His father died last year.

1005
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:55,480
Take it Ramu.
Something to remember me by.

1006
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,750
Please look after him.

1007
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:02,770
Please share your
food with Ramu.

1008
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,560
Goodbye.

1009
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:09,350
Bansi, do come on your free day.

1010
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:48,040
Where are you going?

1011
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:51,380
- See the wonder of my knowledge.
- Please let go of my hand.

1012
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,880
I can't release such a hand,
you fortunate man.

1013
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:58,006
Last I saw such a hand,
it was a king's.

1014
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:01,026
- I'm a craftsman.
- So what?

1015
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,450
You can become a king too.

1016
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,340
Just watch the wonders
of my knowledge.

1017
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:12,690
- The wonder is mostly my own effort.
- You are right.

1018
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,830
The wonder has to come from you.

1019
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,210
But I'll show you your future.
That's the wonder of my knowledge.

1020
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:21,370
Just give Rs 1.25.

1021
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,740
Son, how much bhelpuri
can we get for Rs 1.25?

1022
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:25,890
- A lot, father.
- So, let's spend it there.

1023
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,240
Don't go any further.

1024
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,826
There's danger ahead.
Rahu and Ketu are standing ahead.

1025
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:33,566
Son, do you see Rahu Ketu
(2 stars) standing ahead?

1026
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:35,590
No, only Punditji.

1027
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:38,416
You won't see them.
I'm an astrologer.

1028
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,980
I see them.

1029
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,700
Don't go any further.

1030
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:45,400
My future is in my bag.
Let us go.

1031
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:50,490
It's your wish. But you'll
get stranded and come back.

1032
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,540
- This blows well. Can I have it?
- Is it good?

1033
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,540
- How much?
- Four annas.

1034
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,720
Okay, four annas.

1035
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,120
Let it be. He's a child.

1036
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,010
Don't blow it everywhere.
The police will arrive.

1037
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:04,846
Whether a Brahmin or a farmer...

1038
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:07,140
whether a pauper
or an emperor...

1039
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:09,380
a governor or a Lord...

1040
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:11,640
everyone eats my chaat...

1041
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:13,720
from here in Chowpatty

1042
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,826
It is delicious and very spicy...

1043
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:18,850
this chaat of Chowpatty

1044
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,370
This contains hot spices

1045
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,260
Tastes a little sour.
Thin person eats this and...

1046
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,890
becomes strong

1047
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,500
This modern city Bombai

1048
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:36,946
A turban on the head,
a hefty stomach

1049
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:38,800
Quarreling with the wife

1050
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:43,620
To make up, eat my ragda

1051
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:49,480
It's medicine for the stomach.

1052
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:55,760
The illness will disappear

1053
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,300
Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Parsi...

1054
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,250
all get united...

1055
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,630
while enjoying the wonders
of Bambai's bhel

1056
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:41,780
The bhel is piping hot

1057
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:16,240
Whoever eats my Panipuri...

1058
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:20,940
his life will change

1059
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:25,490
His thoughts fly
high like a kite...

1060
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,520
and forgets everything,
name work, price

1061
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:58,860
- I was able to grab this kite.
- Where's the bag?

1062
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:06,110
- I put it right here, Bapu.
- You left the bag to get this kite?

1063
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,990
No, Bapu, it was right here.
I'll go and look for it.

1064
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:27,990
Have you found it?

1065
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:31,980
- Have you?
- No, Bapu.

1066
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,590
Bansi, Have you found the bag?

1067
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:44,270
- No, Bapu, it's nowhere.
- Look! He's running away with it.

1068
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,200
Run after him.

1069
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:53,630
- What?
- From where did you steal this bag?

1070
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:55,400
- I didn't steal it. It's mine.
- It's mine.

1071
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,250
- Give it! - No!
- I'll give you such a beating.

1072
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,660
- What's going on?
- He's troubling me.

1073
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:05,190
Come to the police station.

1074
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:11,780
- They were fighting
on the footpatrh. - Fighting?

1075
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,590
Saab he was running
away with my bag.

1076
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:16,416
- No saab, it's mine.
- Saab, I lost this bag at Chowpatty.

1077
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,890
- No it's mine.
- Saab...

1078
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:20,090
- he won't show what's in it.
- Why should I?

1079
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,136
- Wait! What's in there?
- My tools, lost at Chowpatty.

1080
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,160
- It doesn't contain tools.
- Then what's in there?

1081
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,810
- It's none of your business.
- See, he's not showing.

1082
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:29,300
Show!

1083
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:30,930
Here. Look.

1084
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,300
Satisfied?

1085
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:37,910
- I apologize. It contains a bottle.
- And not your tools?

1086
01:30:38,410 --> 01:30:40,320
- Alright saab. I'll leave.
- Wait.

1087
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,126
- Why saab?
- What's in the bottle?

1088
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:45,230
- Medicine
- Show me. - Here.

1089
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,110
Don't open it.
It'll get spoiled.

1090
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:53,820
Is that so?

1091
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:59,420
Constable, imprison him.

1092
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:01,410
- Why?
- Because you sell liquor.

1093
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:03,650
I don't sell liquor.
I drink it.

1094
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:05,360
And I have permission for it.

1095
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,700
Permit.

1096
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:12,320
- Arrest him anyway.
- Why saab?

1097
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,370
You are permitted whiskey.
This is county liquor.

1098
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:17,950
What's the difference?
They are both liquor.

1099
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:21,860
- Shut up! - But this is unfair.
I have the permission.

1100
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:27,000
- You can go.
- What about my tools, sir?

1101
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:31,460
While Bansi was running after
the kite, someone stole my tools.

1102
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:34,620
Yes saab. I ran
leaving the bag behind.

1103
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:36,900
- And the bag disappeared.
- Don't worry.

1104
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:40,376
Report this in the outer office.
We'll do our best.

1105
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,426
My job depends on it.
I got it after a long gap.

1106
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:45,370
Don't worry, don't worry...
Havaldar (constable)!

1107
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:49,250
Take them to the flea market
and search for the tools there.

1108
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,900
You might find them there.

1109
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:52,950
Okay, you can go.

1110
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,880
Come on Bansi.

1111
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:41,600
You're back!
The stars told me you would.

1112
01:32:42,270 --> 01:32:43,940
I've been looted.

1113
01:32:44,030 --> 01:32:48,370
Looted or not,
I knew you'd be back.

1114
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:51,580
Your stars are not good.
Take out Rs 1.25.

1115
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:52,980
I'll make them good.

1116
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,920
- Bapu, first ask questions. Only then
give the money. - Keep quiet.

1117
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,110
- Yes, yes. Give.
- Here take.

1118
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:02,730
- My tools got stolen.
- Of course they'd get stolen.

1119
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,840
Didn't I tell you? Rahu
was standing in front of you.

1120
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:11,480
I won't say anything.
This bird will.

1121
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:13,780
Come, son. Come.

1122
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:15,680
Tell the poor man his luck.

1123
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,490
Come on, take. Take.

1124
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,320
Here's your luck.

1125
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:29,470
Take this. Read.

1126
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:35,346
I'll take too long.
You read it.

1127
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:37,810
That's okay. I'll read it. It's enough
that you've touched it.

1128
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:43,120
Go and celebrate.
You've found what you lost.

1129
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:47,850
The enemy is defeated.
You've won.

1130
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,760
Do you have a mole?

1131
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,560
- Mole?
- Yes. On your shoulder?

1132
01:33:57,860 --> 01:33:59,516
Yes, you have one on your shoulder.

1133
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:01,710
Maybe. But will I find the tools?

1134
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,280
Definitely.

1135
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:07,400
The thief has gone 40 steps east
and has returned to the west.

1136
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,016
He left Chowpatty...

1137
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:12,546
crossed the road and is
standing near the hospital.

1138
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:16,840
- Now?
- He's crossed from the South...

1139
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:19,920
- and is going North.
- That's towards our house, Bapu.

1140
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:23,440
He was in the West, is coming
from the South... he... he...

1141
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:25,310
So, search in all directions.

1142
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:26,830
You'll find him.

1143
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,160
But what's the result?

1144
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:33,410
A second question. Give
Rs 1.25 more, I'll tell you all.

1145
01:34:35,630 --> 01:34:37,030
Give.

1146
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:41,790
I have only Rs 1.
Forget about it.

1147
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,630
Your wish. But it's all
a question of Rahu.

1148
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,380
Nothing but stealing,
in your stars.

1149
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:51,390
- Just leave it.
- Your wish.

1150
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:53,450
Your life's in danger.
Believe me.

1151
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:58,230
Paro behen,
haven't they returned yet?

1152
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:00,530
I wonder why they're so late.

1153
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:06,330
Aunt, Bansi hasn't returned yet?

1154
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:10,280
You fight with Bansi,
but can't be without him.

1155
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:13,840
My mother is responsible for it.

1156
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:15,780
- Really?
- Yes.

1157
01:35:48,390 --> 01:35:50,020
- There he goes, bapu.
- Let's follow.

1158
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:51,450
No, you wait here.

1159
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:06,100
Before youth arrived...

1160
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:11,220
her world was something else

1161
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,480
There was simplicity in manner...

1162
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,480
and her smile was different

1163
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:28,670
In no time, what a revolution
has taken place

1164
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:33,620
Youth arrived, and...

1165
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:37,840
such youth!

1166
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:46,030
A glimpse is not enough

1167
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:58,280
When the veil is removed,
the heart races

1168
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:34,190
There's no comparison
left with anyone

1169
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:42,320
Even the sun...

1170
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:45,250
doesn't face her now

1171
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:50,800
Thank god that she...

1172
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:54,870
seldom comes out of purdah

1173
01:37:55,470 --> 01:38:02,780
But the day she does,
the admirers swoon

1174
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:45,910
He plays the tabla well.

1175
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:57,340
Smiling lips, mischievous eyes...

1176
01:38:57,550 --> 01:39:00,060
when one has seen...

1177
01:39:02,090 --> 01:39:10,080
I swear, one has seen the end
of the world come alive

1178
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:15,570
The hearts of the
people on earth...

1179
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:19,210
must've often stopped beating

1180
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:23,420
What the angels saw...

1181
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:28,380
must've made them bow, too

1182
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:21,030
What are you doing here?

1183
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:23,250
- Bapu has gone up.
- Bapu has gone up?

1184
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:27,890
Why are you moving away from me?

1185
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:30,730
Those... Those...

1186
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:36,380
Amma, tell everyone
I won't dance anymore.

1187
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:40,090
- No, no. That's not the thing.
- Let them go, then we'll talk.

1188
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:42,390
- Talk about what?
- Have you all heard?

1189
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:44,750
Mumtaz won't dance anymore.

1190
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,720
Please come tomorrow.

1191
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:50,800
Will Mumtaz dance tomorrow?

1192
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:55,000
- Yes, Yes.
- If not Mumtaz then her mother.

1193
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:58,260
Come on, come on. Go now.

1194
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:16,500
Listen.

1195
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:18,550
Because of you,
I sent them away.

1196
01:41:19,190 --> 01:41:22,290
- Now sit and relax.
- How can I?

1197
01:41:22,970 --> 01:41:24,770
You look worried.
What's the matter?

1198
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:27,730
I've lost something. And have been
searching for so long.

1199
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:31,540
And now you've found it?

1200
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:36,520
That bag there...

1201
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,810
Amma, could you make some paan?

1202
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:42,610
Sure, beti (daughter).

1203
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:45,300
- No, no. I don't chew paan.
- Sethji...

1204
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:47,150
pass me that bag, please.

1205
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:53,310
Here.

1206
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:58,040
Why are you looking there?
Look at me.

1207
01:41:58,690 --> 01:42:00,090
- Come on. Look at me.
- Just wait.

1208
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:04,950
Oh. Paan!!

1209
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,260
Yes. You'll have, no?

1210
01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:11,180
Downstairs a shop sells
good tobacco. I'll go get some.

1211
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:13,060
- I'll send someone.
- No I'll go myself.

1212
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,080
Just listen.

1213
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:18,550
- Where's the bag?
- There's no bag.

1214
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,300
- Get up.
- Okay, I will, I will.

1215
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:23,480
In spite of your disguise,
I recognize you.

1216
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,050
- We both are in the same business.
- What business?

1217
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:27,900
I'll give.

1218
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,040
Take Rs 20.
Leave me alone.

1219
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,100
I want the bag, not money.

1220
01:42:33,290 --> 01:42:34,800
Bag? I won't give it up.

1221
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:38,360
Come to the police station.
Okay, I'll give it.

1222
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:44,556
Stop whistling, and give the bag.

1223
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:46,500
- I won't.
- No?

1224
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:53,090
- Get lost.
- He has my bag.

1225
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:54,720
Go on. There's no bag.

1226
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,410
- I won't get my bag?
- No!

1227
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,220
Run!

1228
01:44:36,970 --> 01:44:38,890
Let's run away, bapu.
Did you get hurt?

1229
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:40,530
I'm alive. Come on.

1230
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:42,060
The bag is here.

1231
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:45,660
It contains money.

1232
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:49,150
Throw it away.
The police will catch us. Run.

1233
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:29,180
What happened, suddenly?

1234
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:33,606
Bapu, your bag is lost.
From tomorrow you have no job.

1235
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:37,010
- That is so. Come on.
- And you'll beat everyone.

1236
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:41,400
Okay, I won't. Come on.

1237
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:43,360
I'm sorry.

1238
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:45,420
Did you see the bag?

1239
01:45:46,130 --> 01:45:47,530
Yes, bap...

1240
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:49,840
That will also have paan
or bottles. Come on.

1241
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:52,280
No bapu. What if it's
the real one?

1242
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:54,320
- Then?
- Should we?

1243
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:59,580
- There's a memsaab standing there.
- So what? Be courageous.

1244
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:02,150
Okay, let's see.

1245
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,540
I'm nervous, but
I'll try to be bold.

1246
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:11,060
Memsaab, I think my bag has
been taken inside. May I go and check?

1247
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:14,430
I can?

1248
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:18,900
You can't come in.
Stay here with memsaab.

1249
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:40,050
I am Rosie

1250
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:42,580
I am Mary

1251
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:45,110
I am Cherry

1252
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:47,950
Dolly's my name

1253
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:51,990
Baby, oh baby, why bother with a name?
Johnny's a slave to his heart

1254
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,290
She has Chameli's face,
but a different name on the lips

1255
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:30,020
So why should anyone be deceived?

1256
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:34,900
The name is Miss Bholi (lnnocent),
but the heart isn't. That's dangerous

1257
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:10,180
I've come running from home

1258
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:14,670
How about us becoming a couple?

1259
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:19,320
The face isn't radiant, the tongue
is sharp, pretending to be young

1260
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:54,800
See my golden hair, Johnny

1261
01:48:54,970 --> 01:48:59,150
Forget it, Mary. It isn't real

1262
01:48:59,650 --> 01:49:04,010
I bid goodbye
to the one who hides the truth

1263
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,490
I am Rosie

1264
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:08,900
I am Mary

1265
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:11,380
I am Cherry

1266
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:13,980
Dolly's my name

1267
01:49:14,370 --> 01:49:18,690
Baby, oh baby, why bother with a name?
Johnny's a slave to his heart

1268
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:59,260
- Speak Hindi, saab.
- Why are you spoiling the dance?

1269
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:01,560
Did I come here to dance?

1270
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:04,086
- I came to check a bag.
- Check a bag?

1271
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:06,990
- It contains my tools.
- Tools? What tools?

1272
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:08,940
I'm a carpenter.
I've lost my tools.

1273
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,990
- I came to see what's in the bag.
- Wait.

1274
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,160
Are you a real carpenter,
or a pretender?

1275
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:16,510
Saab, I'm real.
You are pretenders.

1276
01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:18,160
We are pretenders?

1277
01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:28,810
- Oh Bansi.
- The police have come.

1278
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,520
Wait.

1279
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,160
Show me what it contains.

1280
01:50:50,570 --> 01:50:53,400
You're all junglee,
the way my turban was treated.

1281
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:56,540
I excused her because
she was a girl. Show.

1282
01:50:58,530 --> 01:51:00,450
Look man.
Now go from here.

1283
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:03,056
- This isn't for a carpenter.
- Did you find them, bapu?

1284
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,480
No I didn't. Let's go.

1285
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:10,470
- Now what, bapu?
- It can't get any worse. Sit down.

1286
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:12,960
I'm tired.

1287
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:15,100
Your mother must be
worried at home.

1288
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:17,350
All because of me.

1289
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:18,936
Forget it now.

1290
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:21,926
But without your tools
you won't have a job.

1291
01:51:21,950 --> 01:51:24,620
- The job is definitely lost.
- And I gave away my box.

1292
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,520
- You gave the box away?
- You told me to.

1293
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,320
Troubles come together.

1294
01:51:33,170 --> 01:51:34,570
I don't even have a bidi.

1295
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:37,560
What's he doing?

1296
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:45,670
He's put his hand in the drain.

1297
01:51:50,730 --> 01:51:52,130
Look! Is that ours?

1298
01:51:55,130 --> 01:51:56,576
It looks like ours.

1299
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:58,500
Finally we've found it.
You wait here.

1300
01:55:30,130 --> 01:55:32,506
- I'm not a thief, saab.
- Take him to the police station.

1301
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:34,510
I stopped when I saw you all.

1302
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,580
Why were you running.

1303
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:39,390
Because my bag
got stolen this evening.

1304
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:43,530
I found it and snatched it from the thief,
but he chased me to get it back.

1305
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:47,990
The thief ran after stealing, and you ran
after snatching stolen goods from him.

1306
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:50,980
- What's the story?
- This is my bag. I'm a carpenter.

1307
01:55:51,490 --> 01:55:53,206
- What's in the bag?
- My tools.

1308
01:55:53,230 --> 01:55:54,630
- You can see.
- Show.

1309
01:55:55,130 --> 01:55:56,530
What tools are there?

1310
01:55:56,570 --> 01:55:58,880
Screwdriver, plane, saw.

1311
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:00,890
Is this a screwdriver?

1312
01:56:01,810 --> 01:56:04,700
- What's this? Jewelry?
- This isn't mine, saab.

1313
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,380
Just now you said it was yours.

1314
01:56:07,670 --> 01:56:09,066
Whose is it?

1315
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:10,740
I don't know saab.
You take it away.

1316
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,980
Handcuff him, and take him
to the police station.

1317
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,340
Bansi, come quickly.

1318
01:56:30,360 --> 01:56:32,426
Who is it?

1319
01:56:32,450 --> 01:56:33,850
Wait. I'm coming.

1320
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:37,840
Who's it at this hour?

1321
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:40,010
Paro, you?

1322
01:56:40,430 --> 01:56:41,870
Is all well?

1323
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:47,030
You're crying.
Did you quarrel with Shankar?

1324
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:52,310
What's the matter?

1325
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:54,020
Please tell.

1326
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:57,900
Come in. Don't be nervous.

1327
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:00,000
Come. Bhola's mother is sleeping.

1328
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:02,530
I'm awake, not sleeping.

1329
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:06,640
If you ever step inside
this house again, I'll break your leg.

1330
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:10,220
- Listen, Bhola's mother...
- Bhola's mother isn't so innocent.

1331
01:57:10,610 --> 01:57:12,020
I understand this.

1332
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:15,520
Has Sethji lost all his money
that you're here now?

1333
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,500
What are you saying, Ganga behen?

1334
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:19,630
I came to call Giridhari bhaiya.

1335
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:22,470
I knew one day you'd come.

1336
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:25,490
I understand the meaning of your hymns.

1337
01:57:26,030 --> 01:57:31,020
Come Giridhari. Oh, my dear Giridhari.
Call me Giridhari.

1338
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:34,846
Will you stop your hymn?

1339
01:57:34,870 --> 01:57:37,710
- Let the poor woman speak.
- What will she say in front of me?

1340
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:41,440
Rob other homes
after the death of Shankar.

1341
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,150
Don't say such things, Ganga behen.

1342
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,020
I'm already getting
such bad thoughts.

1343
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:52,646
She's shamelessly confessing
about her bad thoughts.

1344
01:57:52,670 --> 01:57:56,440
Will you stop talking?
Let her say what she wants to.

1345
01:57:56,580 --> 01:57:58,370
- What is it, Paro?
- Giridhari bhaiya...

1346
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:02,250
neither Bansi nor his father
have returned home yet.

1347
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:05,990
Oh. Bansi's father hasn't come home...

1348
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:08,390
so you came to take Bhola's father?

1349
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:10,530
You be quiet.
Have they both not returned?

1350
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:12,160
No, bhaiya.

1351
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:14,860
After many days
he went to work today...

1352
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:17,310
and hasn't returned.

1353
01:58:17,740 --> 01:58:21,150
What a drama queen.

1354
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:23,210
Find a job in a film company.

1355
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:24,746
You'll earn a lot of money.

1356
01:58:24,770 --> 01:58:26,530
Stop talking nonsense
or I'll raise my hands.

1357
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:30,370
This witch turned
a jackal into a lion?

1358
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,930
No. She woke up a sleeping lion.

1359
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:35,290
Paro behen, I'll look for him
and bring him back.

1360
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:38,570
Wait.
Who will go to look for you?

1361
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:40,830
Go and lie down quietly on that mat.

1362
01:58:41,060 --> 01:58:42,460
I'm warning you.

1363
01:58:42,990 --> 01:58:45,990
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1364
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:47,900
Remember,
I'll raise my hands against you.

1365
01:58:47,970 --> 01:58:50,370
Her husband's in danger
and you're talking nonsense non-stop.

1366
01:58:50,510 --> 01:58:51,910
Get out of my way.

1367
01:58:53,390 --> 01:58:55,976
Paro behen,
I'll search every corner of Bambai...

1368
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,400
and bring him back. Don't fear.

1369
01:59:01,910 --> 01:59:04,430
Giridhari uncle!

1370
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:05,970
What happened, Bansi?

1371
01:59:06,680 --> 01:59:08,590
Let's go and free bap...

1372
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:11,240
- What happened?
- The police have arrested him.

1373
01:59:11,270 --> 01:59:12,670
Bansi, stop.

1374
01:59:13,970 --> 01:59:15,366
Bansi.

1375
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:17,040
I've heard all.

1376
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:19,060
I'll tell the whole chaal.

1377
01:59:19,270 --> 01:59:21,060
Oh, Jamuna. Oh Radha!

1378
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:24,150
The police have arrested Shankar.

1379
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:26,010
Listen all chaali people.

1380
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:28,556
Shankar's been arrested.

1381
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:29,980
He must have stolen something.

1382
01:59:30,690 --> 01:59:33,510
Did you hear Giridhari?
The world says he's a thief.

1383
01:59:34,060 --> 01:59:35,460
Is that possible?

1384
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:39,670
Can the hands of a craftsman steal?

1385
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:46,400
You can hear everyone.
Why can't you hear me.

1386
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:53,640
Speak Giridhari.
My lifelong, worship, and devotion...

1387
01:59:53,670 --> 01:59:55,220
has come to beg at your door.

1388
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:57,920
If you don't accept it...

1389
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:00,280
then who'll believe in you?

1390
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:04,910
All the holy scriptures,
your whole world...

1391
02:00:04,970 --> 02:00:06,370
will be proven false.

1392
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:09,360
Say something Giridhari.

1393
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:17,450
You won't talk?

1394
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:20,240
Then listen.

1395
02:00:20,990 --> 02:00:23,560
I made no difference
between you and my husband.

1396
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,110
If my husband's a thief...

1397
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:28,260
then so are you.

1398
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:31,090
If he drowns in the sea of shame...

1399
02:00:31,590 --> 02:00:33,480
then you'll not sit here in comfort.

1400
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,130
Get up from here.

1401
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:43,340
Until my husband gets back his respect...

1402
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:46,150
stay in this cold water.

1403
02:00:51,010 --> 02:00:53,990
Why did you let the thief escape?

1404
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:56,130
Then all would have been alright.

1405
02:00:56,270 --> 02:00:58,236
Uncle, walk on. I'll be back soon.

1406
02:00:58,260 --> 02:01:00,350
- Where are you going?
- You go. I'll come back.

1407
02:01:07,630 --> 02:01:10,620
Yes, this is all mine.

1408
02:01:10,950 --> 02:01:12,370
But some things are missing.

1409
02:01:13,180 --> 02:01:14,820
My gold watch...

1410
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:16,800
Rolex automatic, and...

1411
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:18,610
Sethani's wedding necklace...

1412
02:01:19,010 --> 02:01:20,410
and Rs 500 notes.

1413
02:01:20,730 --> 02:01:22,710
Can't say anything about the notes.

1414
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:24,980
He must have spent it, but..

1415
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:26,890
We'll find the wedding necklace
and the watch.

1416
02:01:27,210 --> 02:01:28,610
We've caught the thief.

1417
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:32,120
We'll ask him with love
if he refuses to tell.

1418
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:35,600
What does the man do?
Just stealing?

1419
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:38,990
He's a clever man.
Calls himself a carpenter.

1420
02:01:39,700 --> 02:01:41,750
He also says he works for you.

1421
02:01:42,180 --> 02:01:44,730
- For us? - Yes.
- I'd like to see him.

1422
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,200
Come.

1423
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:49,500
So, he's the man?

1424
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:52,450
Seth saab.

1425
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:54,696
I didn't want to trouble you, but...

1426
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:57,340
I had to tell them I work for you.
They think I'm a thief.

1427
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:59,540
- Save me saab.
- I didn't come for you.

1428
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:01,510
I've come to identify the jewelry.

1429
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:03,550
- They were yours?
- Yes.

1430
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,800
All are there except two.

1431
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:08,210
Where's the gold watch
and wedding necklace?

1432
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:11,180
Do you think that I stole them,
Seth saab?

1433
02:02:11,490 --> 02:02:13,610
I'm not a thief.
I'm speaking the truth.

1434
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:16,220
Are they lying? They caught you
running away with them

1435
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:20,110
- Seth saab, I was after
my stolen bag of tools... - A lie.

1436
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:22,626
Tell us where the gold watch,
and wedding necklace are?

1437
02:02:22,650 --> 02:02:25,340
I didn't steal.
How can I steal from your place?

1438
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:27,676
I earn my bread from you.

1439
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:29,620
Does he really work for you?

1440
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:31,470
I gave him work just yesterday.

1441
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:33,460
But his wife is our dishwasher.

1442
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:37,930
Oh. So, his wife is a
servant at your place?

1443
02:02:38,290 --> 02:02:41,740
Yes. They were hungry.
I gave bread.

1444
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:45,190
Gave him employment.
This is a good return from you.

1445
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:49,260
- Don't say that Seth saab. I'll be ruined.
- That's the right course.

1446
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:52,290
I thought the poor were
good and honest.

1447
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:56,710
But you have proved otherwise.
This is the right place for you.

1448
02:02:57,060 --> 02:02:59,940
- Come on inspector saab.
- Seth saab, listen. - Be quiet.

1449
02:03:13,170 --> 02:03:14,810
He Raghu, get up. Hey Jaggu.

1450
02:03:15,230 --> 02:03:16,630
Bholu, Pandu, Chandu...

1451
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:20,826
Come with me.

1452
02:03:20,850 --> 02:03:23,360
Let's go free bapu
from the police.

1453
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:25,550
Hurry up.

1454
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:32,890
Run.

1455
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:54,920
He's running away.

1456
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:58,720
You go this side...

1457
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:00,720
You from that side, you all too.

1458
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:28,800
Inspector saab.

1459
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:31,860
- Inspector saab.
- Giridhari bhaiya. - Shankar.

1460
02:04:32,210 --> 02:04:34,680
Giridhari bhaiya, I'm blameless.

1461
02:04:35,590 --> 02:04:38,916
Inspector saab, he's a very decent man.
Why have you arrested him?

1462
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:41,610
- Who are you?
- He's my neighbor.

1463
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:43,070
I'm Giridhari.

1464
02:04:43,130 --> 02:04:47,976
I've known him for 30 years.
He can't even dream of stealing.

1465
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,766
Inspector saab, release him.

1466
02:04:49,790 --> 02:04:51,840
So what we saw was false?

1467
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:55,980
He was caught red handed
fleeing with the stolen goods.

1468
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:59,726
Things went wrong, Giridhari bhaiya.
I thought the bag had tools.

1469
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:01,990
But it had jewelry.
I didn't do anything.

1470
02:05:02,020 --> 02:05:04,420
Yes, yes lnspector saab
will see to everything.

1471
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:08,080
He didn't do anything.
It was a different bag.

1472
02:05:08,120 --> 02:05:10,150
Catch the real thief.

1473
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:12,186
Release him.

1474
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:14,910
You're absolutely right.
We should arrest the real thief.

1475
02:05:17,180 --> 02:05:18,980
Oh yes, yes. I told you
the inspector would...

1476
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:21,590
Go to Parel.

1477
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:24,520
Bring Parvati from Room 13.

1478
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:26,090
Paro? Why?

1479
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:28,660
Why her lnspector saab?
First him now Paro.

1480
02:05:28,690 --> 02:05:30,110
- Are you alright?
- Quiet.

1481
02:05:30,630 --> 02:05:32,800
We're certain
Parvati stole the jewelry.

1482
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:36,250
While cleaning utensils
she cleaned out his safe.

1483
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:40,300
For safe keeping
she gave it to her husband.

1484
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:42,360
That's why he was running with it.

1485
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:44,730
- Is it a lie?
- It is, lnspector saab.

1486
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:47,970
- Go and arrest her. - Arrest her?
Inspector saab... No, no.

1487
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:51,120
Inspector saab,
Don't bring her here.

1488
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:53,300
She doesn't know anything.
Not even...

1489
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:55,590
that I stole.

1490
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:57,616
- Don't bring her here, lnspector saab.
- Shankar.

1491
02:05:57,640 --> 02:05:59,030
Keep quiet Giridhari bhaiya.

1492
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:02,410
Inspector saab, I admit to stealing.

1493
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:06,070
Did you see?
He admitted it without coercion.

1494
02:06:06,570 --> 02:06:08,220
And you came to support him?

1495
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:11,260
Inspector saab, don't you
realize that...

1496
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:13,846
a good man is telling a lie
to save his wife from humiliation?

1497
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:17,170
Giridhari bhaiya, I'm telling
the truth. You know...

1498
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:20,330
I've been jobless for days.
I was fed up of it.

1499
02:06:20,430 --> 02:06:23,556
They are unnecessarily arresting Paro.
I stole the jewelry.

1500
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:27,470
Shankar, shut up.
Do you know the result of this?

1501
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:31,260
You'll get jailed.
So what if they bring Paro behen?

1502
02:06:31,410 --> 02:06:35,400
No, no no. Giridhari bhaiya. They'll
imprison her. Nobody will believe us.

1503
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:39,810
We are laborers. Thieves. Cheaters.
Nobody will listen to us.

1504
02:06:40,150 --> 02:06:41,730
Inspector saab, he's lying.

1505
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:43,450
No, no.

1506
02:06:43,660 --> 02:06:47,140
- I'm telling the truth.
- Now we must bring Parvati.

1507
02:06:47,590 --> 02:06:49,930
He's taking the wife's blame
on himself.

1508
02:06:50,420 --> 02:06:53,260
Now we are sure
she's the real culprit.

1509
02:06:57,980 --> 02:06:59,380
Here's the real thief.

1510
02:06:59,410 --> 02:07:00,950
We caught him
with great difficulty.

1511
02:07:01,940 --> 02:07:03,340
Leave him.

1512
02:07:05,410 --> 02:07:08,240
He's the man from whom
I snatched the bag.

1513
02:07:08,740 --> 02:07:10,140
What's he saying saab?

1514
02:07:10,180 --> 02:07:12,300
- I've never seen him.
- Don't tell lies.

1515
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:13,900
- Tell the truth.
- Leave.

1516
02:07:14,130 --> 02:07:15,840
- Who are you?
- A man.

1517
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:17,640
I can see that.

1518
02:07:17,750 --> 02:07:19,146
From where have you come?

1519
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:21,070
I was hiding... err...
sleeping in a temple.

1520
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:22,940
These boys caught me

1521
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:25,650
And the bag in that man's hands?
Whose was it?

1522
02:07:25,830 --> 02:07:27,216
Not mine saab.

1523
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:29,720
- It's his. - Whose?
- I don't know.

1524
02:07:30,170 --> 02:07:31,900
- Whose watch is this?
- Mine.

1525
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:33,760
- Yours?
- Where did you buy it?

1526
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:36,180
- From a shop.
- I know from a shop.

1527
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:39,130
- How much is it?
- About Rs 200/250 saab.

1528
02:07:39,310 --> 02:07:40,850
- What make is it?
- National.

1529
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:42,670
National?

1530
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:47,780
Inspector saab, remove the watch
and put handcuffs instead.

1531
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:49,520
This is a Rolex.

1532
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:52,300
For Rs 2500, and you say Rs 250?

1533
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:54,350
Search him, havaldar.

1534
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:56,350
Be careful havildar bhai.

1535
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:00,140
He's very dangerous. Look,
inspector saab. He tried to strangle him.

1536
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:04,970
We've seen many
dangerous like him.

1537
02:08:05,230 --> 02:08:06,670
- I don't have anything.
- Be quiet.

1538
02:08:08,610 --> 02:08:10,006
Saab. A knife.

1539
02:08:10,030 --> 02:08:12,070
- I have nothing.
- Quiet.

1540
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:14,120
Saab, money.

1541
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:18,930
Here's the wedding necklace.

1542
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:21,830
Wedding necklace and Rolex watch.

1543
02:08:22,530 --> 02:08:25,470
He's definitely the thief.
Havildar. Handcuff him.

1544
02:08:25,950 --> 02:08:27,370
And release that good man.

1545
02:08:40,610 --> 02:08:42,010
Come Shankar, come.

1546
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:43,840
Here's the watch and wedding necklace.

1547
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:49,306
Bravo, son.

1548
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:52,110
You saved the honor of
your father and law.

1549
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:07,590
You've come back.

1550
02:09:09,510 --> 02:09:11,280
The police arrested me.

1551
02:09:11,640 --> 02:09:14,440
Why did this happen?
What have we done?

1552
02:09:14,890 --> 02:09:17,220
Our luck is bad.
I'm jinxed.

1553
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:21,500
You must have suffered there.

1554
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:23,970
The police must have mistreated you.

1555
02:09:24,930 --> 02:09:27,970
This happened on the
very day you got a job.

1556
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:31,480
Paro, the job's lost.

1557
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:34,360
Lost? How?

1558
02:09:35,240 --> 02:09:36,770
The bag of tools got stolen.

1559
02:09:37,230 --> 02:09:38,930
When I found it,
there was jewelry in it.

1560
02:09:39,290 --> 02:09:40,790
The police took me
to their station.

1561
02:09:40,820 --> 02:09:42,260
That was Seth's lost jewelry.

1562
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:48,270
Paro, he came to the police station,
called me names, and went away.

1563
02:09:48,830 --> 02:09:50,420
Does he think you're the thief?

1564
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:52,996
The thief's caught.
But my name's besmirched.

1565
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:54,406
Who'll give me a job now?

1566
02:09:54,430 --> 02:09:57,640
What'll we do now?
How'll we face the people?

1567
02:09:59,540 --> 02:10:02,780
You're right Paro. Listen.
Let's go away before sunrise.

1568
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:09,400
- Where'll we go? - Anywhere Paro.
We'll live under a tree, but not here.

1569
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:11,190
Collect whatever you can.

1570
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:14,260
Take whatever you can, and go.

1571
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:16,950
A six foot young man
and such a small heart.

1572
02:10:17,270 --> 02:10:19,200
So what if you lost your job.

1573
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:22,850
Get a new one. Buy new tools.
Find a new seth.

1574
02:10:22,940 --> 02:10:25,050
It's not so simple bhaiya.
Our name's besmirched now.

1575
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:27,280
Why are you afraid
of having a bad name?

1576
02:10:27,380 --> 02:10:30,510
Won't the people find out
that you didn't steal?

1577
02:10:30,780 --> 02:10:33,230
If you fear anyone let
it be God, not people.

1578
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:34,790
At least you'll get
favors from him.

1579
02:10:38,570 --> 02:10:39,970
God.

1580
02:10:40,640 --> 02:10:42,040
Forgive me.

1581
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:53,160
Sethaniji.

1582
02:10:55,260 --> 02:10:57,980
We know everything, Paro.
The thief's been caught.

1583
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:01,440
Shankar, I'm sorry for
misunderstanding you.

1584
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,160
And insulting you.

1585
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:05,000
I'm ashamed.

1586
02:11:05,570 --> 02:11:08,320
My luck's bad.
You all are privileged people.

1587
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:11,440
Saying 'I'm ashamed' is easy.
Our lot ends up suffering.

1588
02:11:11,820 --> 02:11:15,810
No, Shankar. I'm genuinely ashamed.
I insulted you wrongly.

1589
02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:20,270
I couldn't bear it when
the real thief was caught.

1590
02:11:21,550 --> 02:11:22,950
Forgive him Shankar.

1591
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:26,190
Your reward.

1592
02:11:26,350 --> 02:11:27,830
That's not necessary.

1593
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:30,110
It's enough that your
doubts have been cleared.

1594
02:11:30,530 --> 02:11:32,350
Because of you we
got back our jewelry.

1595
02:11:32,530 --> 02:11:33,930
That's why I'm giving.

1596
02:11:36,450 --> 02:11:38,690
- Tell him to take it.
- No, Sethaniji.

1597
02:11:39,390 --> 02:11:40,790
He's doing the right thing.

1598
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:43,200
So, this is your Bansi?

1599
02:11:44,930 --> 02:11:47,590
- Give it here.
- No, Sethaniji.

1600
02:11:48,910 --> 02:11:52,730
Don't be stubborn. This is
between the child and Sethaniji.

1601
02:11:53,230 --> 02:11:54,660
Actually, he caught the thief.

1602
02:11:54,730 --> 02:11:56,450
- Giridhari Bhaiya.
- You be quiet ji.

1603
02:11:56,610 --> 02:11:58,430
Please give it to him.

1604
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:00,050
Take it son.

1605
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:05,490
Shankar, meet me tomorrow
at the factory.

1606
02:12:05,850 --> 02:12:07,550
Paro, come to the
bungalow tomorrow.

1607
02:12:09,870 --> 02:12:11,330
Escort Sethji downstairs.

1608
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:19,000
Paro behen, God has
set things right in your home.

1609
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:21,070
Now, my home?

1610
02:12:21,190 --> 02:12:24,640
I'll set it right myself.

1611
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:30,460
Ma, take this.
I'm so sleepy.

1612
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:32,260
Go, sleep.

1613
02:12:35,820 --> 02:12:38,990
That shoeshine boy, dare
compare himself to my darling son.

1614
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:41,310
That witch.

1615
02:12:46,140 --> 02:12:47,980
Singing hymns in your dreams too?

1616
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:50,140
Hey, Mrs.

1617
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:53,150
I've come home.

1618
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:56,050
So what? Must I do
your aarti immediately?

1619
02:12:56,340 --> 02:12:58,930
Pick up that pillow.
Sleep on that mat quietly.

1620
02:13:00,710 --> 02:13:03,900
From today, you'll sleep
on the mat and I on the bed.

1621
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:07,240
- I'm the head.
- Don't talk nonsense.

1622
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:09,270
Have you gone crazy?

1623
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:11,470
I've come to my senses.

1624
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:14,060
Will you get up? Or...

1625
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:18,120
Has that witch Paro,
bewitched you?

1626
02:13:18,210 --> 02:13:20,290
Shut up!
Stop bad mouthing people.

1627
02:13:29,380 --> 02:13:31,220
I'll set fire.

1628
02:13:31,400 --> 02:13:32,800
I'll kill.

1629
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:35,320
Don't insult me.

1630
02:13:35,470 --> 02:13:36,870
I'm Devi.

1631
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:39,250
Worship me.

1632
02:13:42,670 --> 02:13:45,750
Devi, devi,
I'll worship you in a moment.

1633
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:48,560
Let me bring my devta.

1634
02:13:48,860 --> 02:13:50,260
Where's my devta?

1635
02:13:56,430 --> 02:13:57,830
Worship me.

1636
02:14:06,230 --> 02:14:08,130
Tell him to forgive you.

1637
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:14,410
Devi says, go and sleep.

1638
02:14:15,770 --> 02:14:20,210
Where are you going Devi?
Wait here. I'll exorcise her.

1639
02:14:20,930 --> 02:14:22,330
Go away, Devi.

1640
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:25,190
Exactly. That's right.

1641
02:14:26,090 --> 02:14:28,840
So, the devi hasn't
been exorcised yet?

1642
02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:31,600
Come on Devta, set it right.

1643
02:14:32,260 --> 02:14:34,870
Come on, my legs are tired.

1644
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:02,720
So much money?

1645
02:15:06,940 --> 02:15:08,710
Buy your tools.

1646
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:10,760
It will fulfill a carpenter's needs.

1647
02:15:11,390 --> 02:15:12,790
Rs 500?

1648
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:15,230
Do you agree there's a God?

1649
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:18,580
Paro, I don't know
whether he exists...

1650
02:15:19,180 --> 02:15:21,070
but your devotion is genuine.

1651
02:15:23,090 --> 02:15:25,880
You are the provider

1652
02:15:30,420 --> 02:15:32,990
You are the nurturer

1653
02:15:33,390 --> 02:15:37,210
You are everyone's divinity

1654
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:42,220
If you desert us...

1655
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:47,970
then who will protect us?

1656
02:15:53,120 --> 02:15:55,390
If you don't listen...

1657
02:15:55,630 --> 02:15:57,920
then who will...

1658
02:15:58,160 --> 02:16:02,820
to the words of a sufferer?

1659
02:16:03,210 --> 02:16:06,020
Giridhari, the eyes are
longing to see you
