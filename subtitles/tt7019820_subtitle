1
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,850
'The reason for this 8 year old's
inherent violence is because...'

2
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:36,410
'...he knows he can never buy
this car in his lifetime.'

3
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:38,403
'Not just diabetes or blood pressure,'

4
00:01:38,428 --> 00:01:42,468
'Even the violence that stems out of
social disparities is genetic too!'

5
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:49,283
This is the sales graph of
New Fedora company,

6
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,810
our Indian associate...

7
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,388
All our partners have made us lead,
in their respective countries...

8
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,519
...except in India.

9
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:58,603
Because Saffron company is
number one there.

10
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,372
We see it.

11
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:04,372
Your India is the largest consumer
market in the world.

12
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,864
As your company remains
second, we can't be...

13
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:09,249
...at position number one!
in the global market.

14
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:11,491
You have time till next April.

15
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:14,476
Legal or illegal,

16
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:18,685
But just makes us number one in India
if you want to continue.

17
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:19,612
Got it?

18
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:20,364
Yes Sir.

19
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:22,794
Come on worker!

20
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,339
'The Worker'
"Your fingertips transform into tools"

21
00:02:25,364 --> 00:02:28,204
"You make the world, worker!"

22
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,197
"You embrace pain
and churn out vision!"

23
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:34,069
"You're the boss, dear worker!"

24
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:41,807
"Won't your tribe increase!"

25
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,010
"Won't it?"

26
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:52,879
"Won't your sweat make a mark?"

27
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:56,067
"Won't it?"

28
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:59,231
"Lift the world on your shoulders"

29
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:01,087
"Oh worker!"

30
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:04,979
"The Gods shall descend on
your palanquin!"

31
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,570
"Come on, worker!"

32
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,050
"May isn't your only month,
dear worker!"

33
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:17,835
"You'll be celebrated every day,
rise dear worker!"

34
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:31,545
"Your fingertips
transform into tools"

35
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,114
"You make the world, worker!"

36
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:36,810
"You embrace pain
and churn out vision!"

37
00:03:36,835 --> 00:03:39,724
"You're the boss, dear worker!"

38
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,406
'Shall we start?'

39
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:43,474
'Hello everyone...

40
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:45,099
'This is your Arivu speaking'

41
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,444
'When I was in Polytechnic
school, we started a...'

42
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,966
'...community radio exclusive
to our college...'

43
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,711
'...by me and my friends.

44
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:56,656
'It made me very popular and
got me new friends too!'

45
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,942
'It helped us discover
each others' strengths...'

46
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,367
'It was very useful'

47
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:02,974
'That's when I realized...'

48
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:06,279
'...it could be useful for Kolakaarakuppam,
the place where I was born and raised,'

49
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:09,024
'hence I wanted to
start a radio here!'

50
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:12,063
'With tiny savings and with
all of your contribution,'

51
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,490
I could finally launch
KUPPAM FM today!

52
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,919
'When I was young, I asked someone'

53
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:18,664
'Why were we born here?'

54
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:20,328
'Why should we struggle?'

55
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,638
'When will we get out of here?'

56
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,543
'Do you know what he said?'

57
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:26,669
Don't be trapped under circumstances,

58
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:29,654
instead try to change
it in your favor!

59
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,850
That someone is...

60
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,155
- None other than Mr.Kasi.
- Did I say that?

61
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:36,423
Of course brother!
You said it.

62
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,208
Your friend here is trying
to brownnose me.

63
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,200
Not really,

64
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,952
he always respects
you a lot.

65
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:41,703
Continue...

66
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,215
Not just words...

67
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,778
He literally has changed
the fate of our slum

68
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:47,521
And is our undisputed King today!

69
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:48,661
So I don't know if it's possible to...

70
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:49,763
- Hey!
- Bro...

71
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,690
Are you cuddling him?

72
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:52,239
He has embezzled money
using my name.

73
00:04:52,314 --> 00:04:55,194
Just knock him out completely.
Just punch him in the face!

74
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,480
Continue reading...

75
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:01,185
though I can't make you all happy
the way kasi brother does,

76
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,872
- I'll try my best to entertain you.
- Tell him I'll come!

77
00:05:05,145 --> 00:05:08,265
KUPPAM FM is pure entertainment!
That's it bro!

78
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,290
Move away

79
00:05:10,652 --> 00:05:15,466
All I need is your permission
to start this FM.

80
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:16,383
Guys...

81
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:18,638
Why is he hell bent on starting
an FM channel?

82
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:19,583
Will it be profitable?

83
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:21,888
I'm not doing this for money,
it's my passion.

84
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:23,310
Passion, my foot!

85
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:26,163
Even the children in this slum make
15 grand a week.

86
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,719
- Hey Muthu...
- Bro...

87
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:29,942
- How much did your son make?
- 2 lacs bro!

88
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:30,822
Hear it out,

89
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:34,247
He surrendered for just 2 months
and earned a hefty sum!

90
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:35,752
Try to learn.

91
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,077
Start the car

92
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:39,622
Bro,I've struggled for 6 months
to start this...

93
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,770
Please bro...

94
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,530
- Everything is ready.
- Stop the car

95
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,010
- Hey Anbu!
- Bro, Sorry

96
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,450
- Bro, please consider...
- Get in the car

97
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:48,330
Don't keep your husband locked up
with you all the time...

98
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:50,010
- Nothing of that sort bro.
- Send him to work

99
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,890
Bro,please...

100
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:53,298
Atleast give me 10 days!

101
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:55,200
I'll stop this, if you don't like it...

102
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:57,225
Oh God, don't nag!
Go ahead and start it.

103
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,459
Thanks Bro!

104
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:09,354
On cue, listen to Kuppam FM...

105
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,016
Dad, please inaugurate.

106
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:13,810
Why is there a rod instead of a ribbon?

107
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:18,239
Ribbons are a clichÃ© for a world-class
welder like you.

108
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:19,231
Go ahead and rip it dad!

109
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,700
Don't you think it's too much?

110
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,240
Chill mom...watch out
for the fireworks now!

111
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,438
Mom, come here.

112
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:36,239
I know you don't like this stuff,

113
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,264
but still flag-off those buttons,
for my sake.

114
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,670
- This button?
- Yes.

115
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:43,821
- God bless you!
- Thank you.

116
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:50,141
Warm greetings to the folks of
Kolakaara kuppam!

117
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,950
And Happy Ayudha Pooja!

118
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:55,175
This is your Arivu on Kuppam FM 90.8

119
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,727
and you're listening to,
"Let's chat with ARIVU(sense).

120
00:06:56,752 --> 00:06:59,112
- Kumar, can you hear it?
- Very well.

121
00:06:59,137 --> 00:07:02,857
Next to me is Mr.Sadasivam, a Mason,
88 years old...

122
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:05,552
Looks like Mr.Sadasivam is
the chief guest!

123
00:07:05,745 --> 00:07:07,545
- Please talk on the mic.
- Lean forward.

124
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,854
Our slum is actually not
Kolakaarakuppam (Killer slum),

125
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,719
it was Cooliekaarakuppam
(workers' slum).

126
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:17,504
When the Brits ruled, they hired us
to build some of the iconic buildings

127
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:21,414
We built the Ripon and Central station.

128
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:22,414
This gong here...

129
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,645
Don't point here.
The gong is over there.

130
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,150
Whenever our mason would ring that,

131
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:31,262
we would know it was a cue
for us to rush to work.

132
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:35,565
When you made me ring it today;
the sound made me nostalgic.

133
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,239
That was Mr.Sadasivam sharing
his experience with us.

134
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:40,336
Like he said our slum is legendary,

135
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,401
as we have multi-faceted people
from all walks of life

136
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:44,226
like plumbers, carpenters, fishermen,

137
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:46,011
electricians, painters...etc.,.
residing here.

138
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:49,012
Cooliekaarakuppam is now being
called Kolakaarakuppam.

139
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:50,927
How audacious of our neighbors!

140
00:07:50,952 --> 00:07:55,112
Either call us Cooliekaarakuppam
or Kasi's Slum.

141
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:56,454
He rocks man!

142
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:58,270
There are two upsetting things
in the world;

143
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:01,616
One is ignorance and
the other is apathy.

144
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,888
To make you understand that;

145
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:06,112
I'm here to use this radio as a tool.

146
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:09,657
That's why I chose this auspicious day
to launch this FM!

147
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:13,331
Anyone can share their problems
or give solutions,

148
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:16,395
Kuppam FM will be a bridge to everyone.

149
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:18,528
90.8.
Let's chat with Arivu...

150
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:20,609
- Also let's chat with some sense.
- Yes please!

151
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:23,217
We'll start today with a music fest,

152
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:24,802
If you're wondering who it is...

153
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:27,896
it is our very own... famous...
Sengamalam troupe!

154
00:08:27,937 --> 00:08:31,017
These talented girls,
are gonna kickoff the music.

155
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:32,831
Start music!

156
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:36,438
They're damn slow!

157
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:40,528
I don't think this will work out...

158
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,793
We'd better guide them!

159
00:08:57,807 --> 00:08:59,327
"This is Kuppam FM, 90.8!"

160
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:01,167
"Let's chat with Arivu"...

161
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,192
"We'll dance the talk!"

162
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:06,411
"Black people are stereotyped savagely"

163
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:08,496
"Let's change their notion, fell as!"

164
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,474
"Toilers are us;
Don't cast us aside"

165
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,739
"Come, let's show the world!"

166
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:14,586
"Buddy!"

167
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:19,629
"Black people are stereotyped"

168
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:24,552
"Toilers are us"

169
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:27,677
"Our city just became a metro"

170
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:30,382
"The reason for the
change are our bros!"

171
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:35,007
"Though our conditions are nasty our
place is the heart of the city!"

172
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,312
"Black people are
stereotyped savagely"

173
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:39,337
"Let's change their notion, fell as!"

174
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:42,120
"Toilers are us;
Don't cast us aside"

175
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:44,645
"Come, let's show the world!"

176
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,077
"You effing morons!"

177
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:50,606
"Black people are stereotyped"

178
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,046
"Toilers are us"

179
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:58,583
Four bouncers are required
in Supreme hotel

180
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:01,192
Eligible guys, please rush!

181
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:03,217
Did you see what's happening there?

182
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,468
Santa, I heard you were my fanatic!

183
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:07,645
- How could you litter here?
- Wow, my idol!

184
00:10:07,697 --> 00:10:11,577
Try to keep your house clean; but
not at the cost of our roads!

185
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:14,122
Cleanliness is next to Godliness!

186
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:15,044
I'll follow it, hero!

187
00:10:15,162 --> 00:10:16,242
My son rocks!

188
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,550
Our area is Kasi Kuppam

189
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,317
We'll all be united!

190
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:24,155
We don't care who you are!

191
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,300
We'll share our love.

192
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:28,792
Masons built the Tajmahal

193
00:10:28,817 --> 00:10:31,577
Even Shahjahan would vouch for it!

194
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,237
Masons built the Tajmahal

195
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:37,060
Even Shahjahan would vouch for it!

196
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,153
If we ask for help,
others skedaddle!

197
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:41,997
just abscond or go vamoose!

198
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:43,278
But without invitation

199
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:47,036
Our brother Gopalu will stand
by you and lend a helping hand

200
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:52,026
Rulers of the city
have always left us in doldrums

201
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:57,200
They're just namesake habitants
making rules!

202
00:10:57,225 --> 00:10:59,185
Black people are stereotyped

203
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:00,864
Black people are stereotyped

204
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:02,208
But we're a hardworking breed!

205
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:04,993
Black people are stereotyped

206
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:07,154
Black people are stereotyped

207
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:08,179
Effing morons!

208
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,279
Black people are stereotyped

209
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:17,802
But toilers are us

210
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:20,187
Our city just became a metro

211
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,286
The reason for the change
are our bros

212
00:11:23,448 --> 00:11:28,128
Though our conditions are nasty our
place is the heart of the city!

213
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,453
Black people are stereotyped
savagely

214
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:32,478
Let's change their notion, fell as!

215
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:35,255
Toilers are us;
Don't cast us aside

216
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Come, let's show the world!

217
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:43,342
The sturdy shopping mall,
stands tall with our mast!

218
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,427
Masons built the Tajmahal
Even Shahjahan would vouch for it!

219
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:53,717
Cars come and go
but the roads we laid, remains!

220
00:11:53,742 --> 00:11:59,502
Masons built the Tajmahal
Even Shahjahan would vouch for it!

221
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:05,930
"Which is the truth?"
Powered by New Fedora, after the break

222
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:07,239
What's the topic today?

223
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:11,584
6 girls walked out of their
wedding last year.

224
00:12:11,609 --> 00:12:14,089
They are debating if it's
right or wrong.

225
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:17,855
Those girls are not married yet,
even after a year...

226
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:20,661
but the guys they rejected
are all happily married!

227
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:21,864
That's the whole new twist.

228
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,809
You were never keen on these shows.

229
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:27,624
An amazing girl gave a bold speech,
watch out...

230
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:28,809
What speech?

231
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,490
- Hi, I'm Mrinalini
- That's it.

232
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:35,317
- There was something about her speech.
- What?

233
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:38,982
How do I explain it!
Oh here it comes, check it out.

234
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,520
In a society where male chauvinism
has been eradicated,

235
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:47,968
we are here to debate if women use
their new found freedom wisely.

236
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:52,542
Mrinalini, a documentary filmmaker
is here on behalf of these women!

237
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:54,927
First off all, understand one thing...

238
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:59,716
Why do men boast as if
they gave us freedom?

239
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,216
Why this hypocrisy between
men and women?

240
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,041
You guys smoke and booze,

241
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,708
we are also entitled to do
whatever you guys do!

242
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:13,493
Even your profanities targets only
women, can we target men instead?

243
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,630
Switch it off.

244
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:16,735
Wait mom, she's trying
to say something.

245
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:19,584
Men stray around,
although married...

246
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:21,552
would you accept if women
stray like men?

247
00:13:21,577 --> 00:13:24,337
As women, we too have the rights
to choose our sexual partner!

248
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,431
She is too much talking

249
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:26,544
What a slut!

250
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:28,380
Is she gonna ape men
just to prove a point?

251
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:30,942
Just forget whatever she said.

252
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,607
She's ranting like a tramp!

253
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:38,582
Dad, but I swear there was something
about her speech.

254
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,853
You are dared in TV interview
But still you are in home

255
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:45,758
Come out

256
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,623
You said that 'I will smoked and drinked'
Can I company with you?

257
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:57,410
Hey look she's there.
Come out... Muah!

258
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,090
Come out...
How dare you...?

259
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,606
Did you see the ruckus outside?
Why haven't you left yet?

260
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:11,527
My cousin is on the way.
I'll leave as soon as he's here.

261
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,536
Just because she is
holding a mic...

262
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,919
How irresponsible can her speech get!

263
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:17,584
Yuck!

264
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,665
Miru,there's a huge crowd in front
of your hostel...

265
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,690
They'll definitely embarrass you,
Better try to sneak out from the back

266
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,903
Ponni, I'm getting a radio
interference of your son's FM.

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,653
Sir, can you increase the volume?

268
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:41,309
You didn't like your son's
initiative, then what?

269
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:44,020
He said he's gonna talk
about me today.

270
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,160
I'm sure he's going to mock me,
but I'm curious.

271
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:52,736
Ponni, please fetch the
luggage from downstairs?

272
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,350
Ponni, did you see her on TV?

273
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:04,621
Hey Mrinalini,

274
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:07,794
M'm sure you will hear my rants
wherever you are!

275
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:08,939
- No way.
- Why?

276
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:11,974
Our signal here is weak as such,
so how would she hear it?

277
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:15,159
- Don't you want this job?
- Ofcourse.. you rock & roll!

278
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,320
Hey Mrinalini...

279
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:19,945
Don't mindlessly blabber about
women empowerment...

280
00:15:19,992 --> 00:15:22,312
- Do you even know what it is?
- Is it Arivu on air?

281
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:24,317
The ones who work hard can
speak about it...

282
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:27,755
- Switch it off dad.
- Uncle, don't.

283
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,731
A hardworking, homely
woman, my Goddess...

284
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:33,185
Who?

285
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,770
My mom, Ponni

286
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:37,664
She can speak about it, but how you?

287
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:39,896
Wow, English?

288
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,192
- This is Ponni's son Arivu...
- Yes Miru...

289
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:45,377
He has started a community
radio in his slums.

290
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,282
He's such a moron.

291
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:50,118
I've told him to quit and look out
for other jobs, but...

292
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:52,192
Ponni sis, get her some cold water.

293
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:57,951
You have no idea how gentle
and kind my mom is!

294
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:01,096
She hasn't used a single profanity
to scold me, yet...

295
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:03,881
as she's soft spoken

296
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:09,571
but hearing you speak on the show,
she invented new abuses!

297
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:15,118
- Two of which were even new for me.
- Yuck!

298
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:19,258
Stop preaching your half-baked theories
about women empowerment,

299
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:21,231
with your ugly face.

300
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:23,056
- Have you seen her?
- Yes, on TV

301
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:24,200
- Does she look hot?
- Nah!

302
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:25,985
She's actually hot!

303
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,724
- Give me your son's number.
- I really have no clue.

304
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:34,130
If anyone wants to scold Mrinalini,
just give me a call on 7397293339....

305
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:36,036
This is RJ Arivu on...

306
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,181
Kuppam FM, 90.8,
'Let's chat with Arivu!'

307
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:41,288
I'm proud of you my child.

308
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:47,046
Hi, you're speaking
with Arivu (sense).

309
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:49,791
I'm speaking with sense, but looks
like you're nonsense.

310
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:52,005
Looks like our girls too have
developed a sense of humor!

311
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,005
Funny chicks...

312
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:55,588
- Who's this?
- Mrinalini.

313
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,786
- How could she hear?
- It's a miracle!

314
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,239
Would you like to share your thoughts?

315
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:04,083
Would you speak anything
in front of a mic?

316
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,856
I just wanted to share my wisdom
with the society.

317
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:07,411
Do you even have a license to run this?

318
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:09,316
We don't even have a license
for our bike.

319
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,608
First off,you have no rights
to be on air.

320
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:14,552
How dare you tarnish my name?

321
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:18,017
To hell with the radio and
your audience!

322
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:23,997
Children, I'll be off for 2 days.

323
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:25,996
It's Kasi

324
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,114
Ya, tell me Kasi...

325
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:32,379
Looks like you have intervened
with my food inspector?

326
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,439
I didn't believe when my boys told me...

327
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:36,224
Hope to hear from you,
it was unintentional.

328
00:17:36,428 --> 00:17:39,148
Oh, it was very very intentional

329
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,341
How long do you think you can rule us!

330
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:42,886
It's my time now.

331
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,567
That's is why I interfered in
the officer's matter.

332
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:48,712
Oh okay! I got it.

333
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,606
We'll see.

334
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:51,442
Game on.

335
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:55,200
- Bhagya...
- Bro...

336
00:17:55,225 --> 00:17:57,145
We can slay the food inspector
anywhere...

337
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,478
Krishna & Muthu will do...

338
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:02,924
But we have to kill him in Das' area.

339
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,389
And teach him a lesson!

340
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,420
Only a youngster like you
can pull it off!

341
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,130
- Will you do this without any fear?
- You can bet my life on it.

342
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:11,192
- Come
- Bro

343
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:13,217
- Do it tomorrow.
- Sure bro.

344
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:18,013
Hey Bhagya, where did you rush off
in the morning?

345
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:18,958
What is the matter?

346
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:21,143
- Sit down first, I'll explain
- Why?

347
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:23,224
Kasi bro himself called me for a job!

348
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:25,329
Wow, what a sketch!

349
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:26,529
20 guys from our side,

350
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:30,941
All we have to do is murder, escape
and get 3 scapegoats to surrender.

351
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:33,303
Who is gonna surrender?

352
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:36,288
Our boys Logu, Venkat, Guna...

353
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,567
They are school kids man...

354
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:42,616
They've been pestering me for this job
since a long time,

355
00:18:42,898 --> 00:18:44,216
Did you tell them they
have to surrender?

356
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:47,641
I don't have to tell them,
they'll eventually find out on the spot.

357
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,240
You don't have any idea about our plan,
why so many questions?

358
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,457
Come with me, let's announce
the time to our boys

359
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,247
You are completely sloshed;
Sit down first.

360
00:18:55,491 --> 00:18:58,161
They're always around my house,
I'll inform them.

361
00:18:58,254 --> 00:19:01,094
Hey, Logu, Venkat, Guna,
come here...

362
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,028
What's the matter bro?

363
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:05,402
- Didn't you want to work with Kasi?
- We have been waiting only for that.

364
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:06,624
Then come tomorrow.

365
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:10,989
Guys, listen up...

366
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:14,988
We have all heard commentaries on
cricket, football and Kabbadi.

367
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:15,888
LIVE!

368
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:19,593
But for the first ever time you'll
be hearing commentary for a gang war!

369
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:20,883
Through Kuppam FM!

370
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,013
Kasi bro's gang will
be on action today

371
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,114
Bujji seth, Bhagya, Suresh,
Mani, Michael, Anbu...

372
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:30,339
Let's hear the bloodshed...
not just that...

373
00:19:30,364 --> 00:19:33,484
...but, also the aftermath very soon,
LIVE!

374
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,650
The backups...

375
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:45,172
Hey! Look there is some one

376
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,692
Looks like our entire gang gathered
to kill only one guy!

377
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:58,277
So the fight ends on a lame note!

378
00:19:58,517 --> 00:19:58,825
Bummer!

379
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,653
Great, so you'll come soon...

380
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:00,998
I thought of speaking at least today,
it's ruined!

381
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:02,274
Hang on...

382
00:20:02,354 --> 00:20:03,514
There's a twist!

383
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:06,046
Das team is here too.

384
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,085
Both gangs are
equally geared up.

385
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,630
Our guys are extremely dark,
but they are dark and extreme!

386
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:13,455
One bald guy, per team

387
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,470
Weapons in each team...

388
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:17,235
Their eyes are turning red!

389
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,140
clenching their fists,
getting furious...

390
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,845
like a MASS HERO!

391
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:25,529
KASI TEAM VS DAS TEAM
"LIVE" GANG WAR IS STARTING!

392
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:33,573
Judging by their swag;

393
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:36,185
Dhoni must have picked up the
helicopter shot from these guys,

394
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,450
Bhagya is scoring well

395
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,747
They've smashed buji bro's head

396
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,458
Both the teams are fighting vigorously,

397
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:44,489
especially kathir...

398
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:47,274
But someone's sneaked up
behind him nearing him...

399
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,290
Oh shit!

400
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,645
They've smashed his head!

401
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,630
Oh God!

402
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,050
Most of our guys are injured,

403
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,231
You just wait

404
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,075
Arivu...Kathir's mom wants
to talk to him.

405
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:00,856
Hey Kathir! Your Mom's on line.

406
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:01,536
Place it on your ears

407
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:03,471
- Kathir!
- Mom, nothing to worry

408
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:05,189
I'm scared shitless,

409
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:06,825
Please come home son.

410
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,450
Kathir is geared up to fight some more,

411
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:12,395
Might as well even sacrifice
his life for Kasi!

412
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:19,599
Das himself has joined the fight

413
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:23,304
He's lopping everyone with his billhook

414
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:27,049
Our guys are clueless,
but Bhagya has spotted him.

415
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:28,585
Come on!

416
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:31,833
Das and Bhagya head on...

417
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:35,622
Bhagya is slashed by Das...

418
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:37,647
Hey Bhagya...

419
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,890
Get up...

420
00:21:41,915 --> 00:21:43,795
Oh snap, our line is disconnected...

421
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,141
You're bleeding profusely, let's go!

422
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,138
Try to get up...

423
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:55,243
The pain is unbearable!

424
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:01,286
They have surrounded us

425
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:02,871
I'm scared...
They're gonna kill us!

426
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:03,776
Go fight them!

427
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:05,981
Are you kidding me?
I don't know to fight

428
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:09,886
If you like me, then do this for me...

429
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,206
I'm not getting angry

430
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:17,151
Just imagine someone who you hate,
who makes you furious...

431
00:22:17,176 --> 00:22:18,296
And hit him...

432
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,650
Hey... hey... Don't...

433
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,638
Stop it!

434
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,303
Put it down! Just put it down.

435
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:02,917
- Who did you imagine?
- I thought of the "esteemed Kasi"...

436
00:23:03,325 --> 00:23:04,965
What?

437
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:08,306
Hey Logu, come here...

438
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,638
Did you see that?

439
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:12,317
You guys wanted to work
with Kasi, right?

440
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:13,822
For what? All this skirmish?

441
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,606
Do you even know why they
called you here?

442
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:17,111
- Stop it Arivu...
- Shut the f**k up!

443
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:20,528
To make you surrender for their crimes.

444
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:23,295
What are you looking at?

445
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,720
They conned Saravana to
surrender for 2 months.

446
00:23:26,854 --> 00:23:28,247
It's been 2 years
but he's still in jail.

447
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:31,152
Police dragged Moorthy
in to this too.

448
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:33,810
They cut his femoral nerve...
and now he's paralyzed...

449
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,050
His poor mom is taking
care of him till date!

450
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:38,185
Do you wanna belong in this list?

451
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,210
Do you?

452
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:45,185
Just because you were born here doesn't
mean you have to follow their paths...

453
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,490
You can become anyone you want to!

454
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:47,578
You decide...

455
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:48,883
What you want to become.

456
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,747
Das, Das, I'll sign those papers
for you.

457
00:23:56,772 --> 00:23:58,772
But please save me from Kasi.

458
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,099
- Hey Mr.Food inspector...
- Leave me

459
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:17,244
Is he your protector?

460
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:23,875
Safeguard him now...

461
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,052
Till his corpse rots!

462
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:26,357
I'm sparing your hand now

463
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:28,659
If you have guts, fight me again...

464
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:31,231
- Kasi bro has accomplished his task.
- Where is that 3 guys?

465
00:24:31,256 --> 00:24:32,816
He's looking for those 3 boys
to surrender

466
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:34,726
- Looks like they fled.
- What the hell?

467
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:37,033
Sounds strange...

468
00:24:37,646 --> 00:24:41,028
Logu, Guna and Venkat
managed to escape...

469
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:41,849
Give it to me bro...

470
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:43,554
But Syed bro volunteers now.

471
00:24:44,494 --> 00:24:46,534
But Kasi doesn't want him ousted...

472
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:50,878
He's choosing someone
easily dispensable.

473
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,630
Anbu come here...

474
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,716
The chosen one is...

475
00:24:56,741 --> 00:24:57,501
Anbu!

476
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:01,028
Jail isn't new to him...

477
00:25:01,053 --> 00:25:04,613
But this time,
his wife is pregnant

478
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,192
He won't be here to
see his baby's birth

479
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:08,297
Hardluck!

480
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:13,369
Hey Arivu,

481
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,431
I just visited Bhagya
at the hospital now

482
00:25:15,456 --> 00:25:18,736
He says you thrashed everyone,
keeping Kasi in mind.

483
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:20,561
Please tell me it is not true...

484
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,998
Not just that,

485
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,103
The purpose of this radio is
to put an end to him!

486
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:26,408
To put an end to him?

487
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:29,849
That selfish ba****d has transformed
us into killers, for his benefit!

488
00:25:30,382 --> 00:25:32,786
Hardly 10% of our guys are
employed well...

489
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:36,931
The rest of them work for Kasi
with or without their knowledge.

490
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,442
Earlier generations were coerced into
this path due to fear and poverty,

491
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,387
but the current generation seem to
enjoy this life of sadism...

492
00:25:42,496 --> 00:25:49,496
These orphans, illiterates are enslaved
and lured by drugs and women.

493
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:51,441
When I wondered why nobody
questions him;

494
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:55,247
I realized he has loaned money to all
these people and enslaved them further!

495
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:57,349
Instead of inspiring people
to work hard,

496
00:25:57,374 --> 00:25:59,534
He's brainwashed them to commit crimes.

497
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:04,471
I'll use his own people against him!
and make my radio campaign stronger!

498
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:08,735
We'll ask him, come on.

499
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:13,106
What's with the crowd?

500
00:26:13,147 --> 00:26:14,227
Hello sir...

501
00:26:14,252 --> 00:26:17,270
You do know that my son is
getting married next month...

502
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:19,415
and he is in the hospital now...

503
00:26:19,757 --> 00:26:21,552
Why do you have to
put us through this?

504
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:22,737
He trusted you with his life,

505
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:24,402
But he's battling for his life now!

506
00:26:24,512 --> 00:26:25,832
What do I do?

507
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,521
Arivu is the reason behind this...

508
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:31,445
Move away...

509
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,950
All of you...

510
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:34,415
Back off!

511
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:39,792
Hey Arivu, he is walking over
here with great fury.

512
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:42,137
I guess he will rattle our place.

513
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,920
Damn...Arivu, he is here!

514
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:48,318
What are you doing?

515
00:26:50,624 --> 00:26:51,384
Hit me bro

516
00:26:51,636 --> 00:26:53,316
Smash this place down...
And also me.

517
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:54,974
I wanted to show them
your might and power...

518
00:26:55,095 --> 00:26:56,388
But these fools
misunderstood me!

519
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,658
Not everybody is as brave
as you to do this...

520
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:01,407
Inspite of knowing the
perils of this job

521
00:27:01,432 --> 00:27:02,552
What I did was a mistake...

522
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:04,672
Expunge this place brother!

523
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,791
Will I be heard on this radio?

524
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:10,606
Bro?

525
00:27:10,724 --> 00:27:12,966
Can people hear me, even if I speak?

526
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:13,815
Of course.

527
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,822
You ungrateful swines,

528
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,544
Kasi here. what are
you hooting at?

529
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:26,449
Don't act as though you suddenly
turned over a new leaf!

530
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:29,648
Your livelihood
depends on crimes...

531
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,786
If not for it, you will all be
on roads or cleaning toilets!

532
00:27:33,827 --> 00:27:35,427
If not for me...

533
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:37,888
You wouldn't even
have a place to stay.

534
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:39,113
You fucking morons!

535
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:42,286
You morons depend on me for
everything from birth to death...

536
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:47,250
Remember ...whatever you have today
are my free handouts!

537
00:27:48,277 --> 00:27:53,757
Nobody has rights to their lives here.
I own you all.

538
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:56,324
Kasi, don't get mad.

539
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:57,958
Why would we rebel against you?

540
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,599
We live through your alms

541
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:00,544
Come here...

542
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:03,705
Has a policeman ever
been here before?

543
00:28:03,886 --> 00:28:06,406
Hey, I've gotten you everything.

544
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:08,114
from ration cards...
to money for your votes

545
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:09,699
How dare you question me?

546
00:28:09,984 --> 00:28:13,864
I'll throw all of you
out of here, beware!

547
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:18,447
You're the reason behind this.

548
00:28:19,096 --> 00:28:22,216
I'll slit your throat, the next time
you go on air!

549
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:27,471
Oldie, don't die yet you will
have to cremate him very soon!

550
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:28,496
Sir, don't...

551
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,620
Brother, just a second...

552
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,942
I didn't mean this...

553
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:33,427
Apologize Arivu!

554
00:28:33,452 --> 00:28:34,731
Please don't shut my radio down!

555
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:36,422
Are you happy now?

556
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,872
You pampered him so much...

557
00:28:37,897 --> 00:28:39,185
And turned him into a spoilt brat!

558
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,570
Now Kasi is threatening us...

559
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,360
Arivu, looks like your mom's
blasting you.

560
00:28:46,385 --> 00:28:46,985
What?

561
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,067
Your mom's voice is heard on the radio.

562
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:50,356
She's ranting about you to your dad...

563
00:28:50,381 --> 00:28:51,501
Here, have a listen

564
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:55,349
Your son seems to know all about...

565
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:58,889
what each and everybody in
our slum is up to..

566
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:00,753
Every single damn, trivial detail...

567
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:03,719
Does he have any idea about
our own problems?

568
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:06,184
Has he any idea about our debts?

569
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:08,839
Or about his sister's college fee?

570
00:29:08,934 --> 00:29:12,574
Or at least about the interest
we're paying for his education loan?

571
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,759
On top of that...

572
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:16,966
Welding day and night...
your eyesight has deteriorated!

573
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:19,099
Does he know, you've to undergo
surgery in a month?

574
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,764
Or the doctor said
you will go blind!

575
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,370
Is he aware of at least that?

576
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,630
Inspite of being such a young girl our
daughter said no, to costly curriculum,

577
00:29:29,655 --> 00:29:32,375
in light of our situation.

578
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:36,133
Our son doesn't have even
half the maturity she does!

579
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:40,238
This goon is threatening to kill him.

580
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:42,271
Our son will die...

581
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:44,045
You will go blind soon...

582
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:49,478
As your son's payback to us his sister and
myself will forever be stuck as maids,

583
00:29:49,503 --> 00:29:51,703
to support you two!

584
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,786
Nothing of that sort will happen.

585
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:57,691
He will make us proud soon!

586
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:16,398
Don't mind your mother...

587
00:30:16,462 --> 00:30:17,542
I'm fine.

588
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:37,064
Welcome to walk-in at Saffron,
we wish all the best for the candidates

589
00:30:38,382 --> 00:30:40,822
It's getting late
When they start interview?

590
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,830
Why is he pretending to be so sincere
in front of the CCTV?

591
00:30:56,901 --> 00:30:58,581
Sir, they are calling you.

592
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:03,409
Why boss?

593
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,848
Why are you so tensed? Just relax.

594
00:31:05,873 --> 00:31:07,953
Anyway, I'm Hari...

595
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:11,102
- I'm Arivu
- Okay, nice meeting you!

596
00:31:12,351 --> 00:31:14,751
- Excuse me, Here's your pen.
- Thank you.

597
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:20,598
Mom, I'll perform well
in the interview...

598
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:22,478
I'll definitely get this job...

599
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,215
I'll call you after the interview;
please hang up.

600
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:30,127
Is it your mom?

601
00:31:31,191 --> 00:31:32,911
Yes, she's more tensed than me!

602
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:35,351
Aren't all mothers the same?

603
00:31:37,902 --> 00:31:39,902
- Adhi...
- Arivu...

604
00:31:39,996 --> 00:31:41,596
- I'm...
- Hari, I know!

605
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,539
Having eavesdropped, he says it
as though he invented my name!

606
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,825
Guess he is new to this sales job...

607
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,290
He looks like a Malayalam
movie star now,

608
00:31:49,383 --> 00:31:51,583
but soon he'll look
wasted like Dev D!

609
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,325
You must have one hell of an
experience with interviews!

610
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,599
Have you been to all of them?

611
00:31:55,761 --> 00:31:57,601
Hell yeah!

612
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,140
There will be 4 guys
interviewing here...

613
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:03,605
2 bald guys and 2 nerds
they will ask us ton of questions...

614
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:06,069
...but they won't know
any of its answers!

615
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,327
Am I right?

616
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:08,093
I don't know.

617
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:10,118
Can't believe he doesn't know.

618
00:32:10,252 --> 00:32:12,780
They asked me about my-self(shelf)
in an interview...

619
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,913
I told them I have 2 boxers
& 2 briefs in my-shelf!

620
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:16,658
I landed the job for
my sense of humor

621
00:32:16,698 --> 00:32:18,298
Idiots...

622
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,959
Hello, why're you pestering me
with your postpaid plans?

623
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:24,737
I myself will call you if I need one.
Hang up.

624
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:27,934
Sir, you can come now.

625
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:33,203
- Is it your friend?
- No, it's the VP.

626
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:34,520
You mean Venkat Prabhu?

627
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:36,688
No, it's the vice-president
of the company

628
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:39,393
He wanted to know if he
can come and I said YES!

629
00:32:39,511 --> 00:32:40,991
I shouldn't have asked you bro...

630
00:32:41,016 --> 00:32:43,896
But stop kidding with his name!

631
00:32:45,573 --> 00:32:47,373
Okay boys, this interview is over!

632
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,370
Over?

633
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,840
Sir, 7 guys seem okay for this job...

634
00:32:51,015 --> 00:32:53,950
1, 2, 3, 4...

635
00:32:53,975 --> 00:32:55,455
5...6 & 7 okay.

636
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:57,143
Chuck the rest of them.

637
00:32:57,505 --> 00:32:59,919
That guy, is constantly looking
at his watch.

638
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,144
Doesn't have any patience.

639
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,340
The prerequisite for a
sales job is patience!

640
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:05,255
Doesn't matter if it's
an hour or a day,

641
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,160
one should have patience to
get their job done.

642
00:33:07,312 --> 00:33:09,992
This guy, even before this
interview could start...

643
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:13,297
...is already scouting for other jobs
in the newspaper!

644
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:17,296
And him, normally customer care
calls are super polite...

645
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,005
...but he is unreasonably
harsh to them.

646
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,380
How will he handle
our harsh clients?

647
00:33:22,405 --> 00:33:25,205
The rest, don't have pens...

648
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,230
Can't tie shoelaces...

649
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,455
Especially this yellow shirt!

650
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:32,192
Boss, I understand what
you are gonna say

651
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:32,966
I myself will leave.

652
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:35,191
Except for the selected 7,
the rest of you get out.

653
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:37,229
Thank you, Adi good job

654
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:41,206
You saved an entire day for us...

655
00:33:41,254 --> 00:33:42,774
by finishing it in half an hour!

656
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:45,528
But for you, we couldn't be sure
if we chose the right guys.

657
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,079
It's okay
Anything for you sir!

658
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:50,245
- I'll see you at the office.
- Sure sir!

659
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:53,157
Excuse me sir, just a minute.

660
00:33:54,653 --> 00:34:00,370
Sir you explained why you rejected
them, but not why you selected us.

661
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:05,143
Excuses are given, only for
something you don't want...

662
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:07,318
Not for something you want.

663
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,935
Hello everyone, I'm Aadhi,
your brand manager.

664
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:18,989
You'll be working for India's No.1,
FMCG company!

665
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:21,296
No matter how many
departments are here...

666
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:27,418
It's only the sales team that brings
back the company's investments.

667
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:30,603
You rock stars will determine the
company's success!

668
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:31,677
Say we're the best!

669
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:32,497
We're the best!

670
00:34:32,522 --> 00:34:34,682
- We are the best!
- We are the best!

671
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,653
- Will mom be delighted?
- Obviously!

672
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:52,118
- Mom
- Mom!

673
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:54,285
Behave yourself little bro.

674
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,030
Mom...

675
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,126
- Somebody has just landed!
- Where?

676
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,488
She looks like my
match made in heaven!

677
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:03,403
Shit, she'll shred me
if she hears my voice...

678
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:06,228
- It's time for me to go
- Then it's time for me to stay...

679
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:08,755
- Hi ma'am!
- Hello!

680
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,997
Excuse me, can you call Arivu's mom?

681
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:13,622
We're talking to you, could you please
call his mother?

682
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:15,975
- He's upto something...
- Arivu, Arivu...

683
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,560
- Are you Arivu?
- Yes..err.. no

684
00:35:19,177 --> 00:35:21,570
How dare you talk
about me on the radio?

685
00:35:21,595 --> 00:35:23,700
I'm right in front of you now
Let's see what you've got!

686
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:25,786
Talk now
If you some b***s!

687
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:26,442
Shit!

688
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:28,427
Why are you looking at him?
Instead of talking to me...

689
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:30,944
I wanted to come over
your place to thrash you,

690
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:33,609
But I spared you for
your mom's sake!

691
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,465
Mom!

692
00:35:35,763 --> 00:35:37,474
Hi, I'm Arivu's friend...

693
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:39,402
I came to tell you I landed the job.

694
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:41,028
And seek your blessing!

695
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:44,310
But Arivu has landed
in trouble with her!

696
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:47,629
Did you understand?
Mommy...!

697
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,544
Your friend is more courteous
to your mom than you...

698
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:55,167
But you look like a disgusting pig!

699
00:35:55,348 --> 00:35:56,216
Aren't you ashamed?

700
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,724
Can't you be decent like him?

701
00:35:57,776 --> 00:36:00,376
Did you just say, "decent like ME?"

702
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:03,167
He's a sarcastic fellow
Watch out he'll try to mimic me now.

703
00:36:03,192 --> 00:36:04,020
No mom...

704
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:07,085
He is so sarcastic
He was not even born to me!

705
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:09,239
- You leave son!
- Okay

706
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:10,513
Don't spare this fat pig

707
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:11,978
- Smash him!
- Just go...

708
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,778
Hey Arivu!

709
00:36:14,803 --> 00:36:18,247
You look stylish
Did you attend any interview?

710
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:19,558
Miru, this is RJ Arivu...

711
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:22,063
Sweetbox?
So did you get the job?

712
00:36:24,105 --> 00:36:26,145
- She stares intensely!
- Hey, all the best!

713
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,530
Hope you understood?

714
00:36:28,276 --> 00:36:29,236
Isn't it Arivu(sense)?

715
00:36:29,261 --> 00:36:30,544
I don't have any, since my birth.

716
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,030
- Get lost!
- Huh?

717
00:36:32,188 --> 00:36:34,068
- Go!
- Thank you!

718
00:36:34,998 --> 00:36:38,118
Buddy why did she scold you?
Did you do a bad mimicry show?

719
00:36:39,437 --> 00:36:42,637
I told you already he
wasn't born to me!

720
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:45,778
Super bro, let's rock

721
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:46,683
Take it

722
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:51,559
Meet Stella from the Sales department,
on 3rd floor.

723
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,944
-Stella?
-Yes

724
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:02,135
Hang on, let me check!

725
00:37:03,576 --> 00:37:05,176
Ms.Stella?

726
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,974
Stella is having a massage.

727
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:08,497
-Massage?
-Yes.

728
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:12,036
Stella Madam!

729
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:14,395
Sir? You are?

730
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,780
Yes, I'm Stella Bruce!

731
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,332
Really?

732
00:37:17,357 --> 00:37:18,917
Why what did you expect?

733
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:20,795
It's a chick's name!

734
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:23,060
One can use a woman's name,
but not a woman

735
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:24,372
come to the point...

736
00:37:24,397 --> 00:37:25,757
I'm Arivu(sense)!

737
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:28,183
I'll be the judge of that!

738
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,240
Being my first day,
what am I gonna learn today?

739
00:37:31,265 --> 00:37:32,481
Whatever I'm gonna teach you!

740
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:33,506
What will you teach?

741
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,091
Whatever you ought to know!

742
00:37:35,572 --> 00:37:36,380
Turn left...Turn left...

743
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:37,365
Here?

744
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:40,442
-Sir... Sir... This shop?
- Yes

745
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:42,195
What order will we get here?

746
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,740
No, we are here to give orders.

747
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:45,837
Hey fat face, makes us some tea.

748
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:46,862
Sir, we're getting late...come soon.

749
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:48,028
why hurry?

750
00:37:48,524 --> 00:37:50,730
Sir, let's commence our work

751
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:54,110
When celebrities are selling
our products on TV...

752
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:55,173
why should we toil?

753
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,760
-Not that Sir...
-You're off limits!

754
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,440
- Sir?
- You're just a practice boy!

755
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:00,496
Get me the Christmas order details
of the supermarkets

756
00:38:00,521 --> 00:38:02,321
Sir, I'll arrange it before
you come back.

757
00:38:04,277 --> 00:38:06,797
Sir, I want to talk to you personally...

758
00:38:07,928 --> 00:38:08,769
Sir...

759
00:38:08,891 --> 00:38:11,811
Please don't think I'm bitching
about my senior...

760
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:13,593
But Mr.Stella Bruce is unfit for the job

761
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:15,863
He doesn't teach me anything

762
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:18,238
Nor does anybody respect him ...

763
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:21,681
we are unable to achieve
our weekly targets too!

764
00:38:21,744 --> 00:38:23,379
Stella, what sort of a team
are you running?

765
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:25,298
Either you should achieve
the set targets

766
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,527
or resign and get the f***  out!

767
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:30,272
I'm scared of losing the little bit
of talent I have,

768
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Everybody looks up to you
in our office...

769
00:38:32,425 --> 00:38:33,800
let me learn from you.

770
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:37,058
I want to work hard and succeed!

771
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,720
First stop yapping like this.

772
00:38:40,911 --> 00:38:42,311
How else can I succeed?

773
00:38:42,336 --> 00:38:43,656
Work smart, not hard!

774
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:47,902
"Hardwork" is begging people
to buy our products...

775
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:50,425
But "smart work" is making the
consumer understand

776
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,810
...that he needs our product.

777
00:38:52,568 --> 00:38:57,088
To understand our consumer,
marketing is more important than sales

778
00:38:57,486 --> 00:39:00,806
I get it... but I also don't get it!

779
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:02,869
Let me tell you.

780
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,000
Look at the place,
what do you see?

781
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,808
Ofcourse, it's a supermarket!

782
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,839
Supermarket is super marketing!

783
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:15,607
Let me tell you something

784
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:18,425
As soon as you enter any supermarket,

785
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:20,644
the basic psychology is to look
at the right corner,

786
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:22,451
so that spot is very important.

787
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:24,480
That's where our products are!

788
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:26,535
The next crucial element is smell

789
00:39:26,962 --> 00:39:28,207
so look to your left...

790
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,712
they would've stacked up
fragrant products

791
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:34,608
to instill freshness to our customers.

792
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:38,864
Do you know why they give you a basket
as soon as you enter?

793
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,750
yes.. errr.. to carry
all our belongings.

794
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:46,355
Just in case if someone wants
to buy only one product

795
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,860
this will make them feel guilty
and trick them in to buying more.

796
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:54,918
Likewise, kids' goodies will be placed
on the 3rd row

797
00:39:54,943 --> 00:39:57,343
because it's easy for the kids to reach.

798
00:39:59,136 --> 00:40:05,016
But the essentials like rice, milk, etc
will be towards the end

799
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:07,808
because you have to cross
so many products to reach them.

800
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:11,282
Hence you'll be distracted and buy it.

801
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,761
Have you seen a window here?

802
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:18,035
No sir.

803
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,300
Not even clocks?

804
00:40:19,515 --> 00:40:23,355
It's to make customers
lose track of time

805
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,988
Not just that, every supermarket
will have

806
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:28,853
a different entry & exit!

807
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:32,224
It's to lure you in to buying
unnecessary items

808
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:33,449
On top of that,

809
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:36,474
a few products will be placed
at the bill counter too.

810
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:40,225
to tempt you even when you're in line!

811
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:43,407
Look, there, on TV...

812
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,699
It's the marketing strategy of
our competitor,

813
00:40:45,724 --> 00:40:46,924
"NEW FEDORA"!

814
00:40:47,117 --> 00:40:49,918
They're advertising without revealing
the product

815
00:40:50,016 --> 00:40:52,656
to induce curiosity in the
consumer's minds...

816
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:57,584
even our guys are breaking their heads
to find out what it is.

817
00:40:57,609 --> 00:40:59,049
Marketing is such an ocean!

818
00:40:59,074 --> 00:41:02,754
What I said was just 10%,
marketing is everywhere.

819
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:06,248
Every single tactic used from
birth till death...

820
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:12,031
totally revolves around marketing.

821
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,856
So nothing is impossible in marketing

822
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:16,151
From now on, look at everything that way

823
00:41:16,176 --> 00:41:18,816
Sir, I'll rock sales & marketing
here on!

824
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:23,918
I've come across a guy called Aadhi,

825
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:26,984
what he tells me is to do smart work
instead of hard work.

826
00:41:27,142 --> 00:41:29,542
He's demanding more money
to unload this inside

827
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:30,816
when I questioned him, he left irately.

828
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,521
I'll do it sir.

829
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:37,468
He's stacked all his products
in the front

830
00:41:37,493 --> 00:41:39,253
It's everywhere!

831
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:46,219
If I combine his acumen and my hard work

832
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,730
I can make it big! You guys also can!

833
00:41:48,808 --> 00:41:49,980
It'll change our lives!

834
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:51,645
"Have little patience"

835
00:41:52,073 --> 00:41:55,033
"Work hard to win the race"

836
00:41:55,058 --> 00:41:59,178
"Do not think to be an owner
for a small trade forever"

837
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:01,308
I'll give you the order the next time
we meet.

838
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,973
Sir, this is what you said last time too

839
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:06,038
Trust me, I'll give you the order
the next time I see you.

840
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:10,746
"Hit...do not give up
will get the success"

841
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:14,331
"Place mountain on the shoulders
Can easliy hold that, trust us"

842
00:42:14,356 --> 00:42:15,316
Hey, what's this?

843
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,902
You promised to give the order,
the next time you saw me

844
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:18,847
Did you run across 9 floors?
Are you mad?

845
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:22,093
You must learn from him,
he's a damn smart guy!

846
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,729
You've earned the order,
come to my office

847
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:26,039
Thank you sir!

848
00:42:29,824 --> 00:42:31,004
He's Arivu, he works for Saffron.

849
00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:32,149
Hello... Hi...

850
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:34,247
These are our 5 elements!

851
00:42:34,272 --> 00:42:35,832
-Land
-Real estate

852
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:37,177
-This is Air.
-Vaccum cleaner

853
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:38,802
- Here's Sky
-Dish TV

854
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,350
- He's Fire
-Induction Stoves

855
00:42:40,438 --> 00:42:41,714
-He's water
-Water purifiers!

856
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,520
Leave the rest of them,
what do you do?

857
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:44,816
I sell anything that I can get
my hands on

858
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:46,066
We need to start a WhatsApp group

859
00:42:46,091 --> 00:42:46,731
For what?

860
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:48,355
If the Water can doesn't reach me
by today,

861
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,540
I'll change the vendor.

862
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:51,285
RO water is your solution.

863
00:42:51,448 --> 00:42:52,355
RO water?

864
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,582
We can help each other on the side
by referring each other to our clients,

865
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:56,777
And sharing info on the group.

866
00:42:56,933 --> 00:43:00,691
Though you are a Tamilian, enroll it
it'll be shared in the group

867
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,613
Why did you stop with just one son?

868
00:43:09,638 --> 00:43:13,478
If you had another son,
he would've liberated the entire country

869
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:14,964
Mom, looks like she's asking you.

870
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:16,069
Huh!

871
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:23,342
Yes Arivu?

872
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,050
I've decoded something about
the New Fedora ad.

873
00:43:26,075 --> 00:43:27,475
Let me hear it...

874
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:29,485
These 2 are the bull's horns...

875
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,670
The blue ones are the cow's udders

876
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:35,615
If we connect both, it looks
like a milk brand

877
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:38,326
But I don't understand the SUN though!

878
00:43:39,288 --> 00:43:40,568
The Sun?

879
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:42,668
Vitamin D is present in the Sun's rays.
That's why!

880
00:43:42,693 --> 00:43:46,293
They're essentially conveying,
that their milk is nutrient rich

881
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:48,130
Oh you found out already!

882
00:43:48,155 --> 00:43:50,915
Even the advertisers can't explain this
with such clarity.

883
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:54,656
Here's the account of our expenditure,
have a look

884
00:43:54,696 --> 00:43:56,296
You're my mom,

885
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:57,927
why would I probe you about my money?

886
00:43:57,952 --> 00:43:58,832
Have you kept track...

887
00:43:58,857 --> 00:44:00,457
of all the sacrifices
you made for me?

888
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:03,035
It's inhuman to be crafty
with your own mom.

889
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,220
No, there's a 3 grand that's.....

890
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:09,129
I don't care if it's 3 or 30 grand,
it's all yours.

891
00:44:09,321 --> 00:44:10,801
You dumbo...

892
00:44:10,912 --> 00:44:14,072
I meant there's a shortage

893
00:44:14,097 --> 00:44:15,937
what you gave me wasn't enough!

894
00:44:16,055 --> 00:44:17,255
what?

895
00:44:17,984 --> 00:44:19,169
Better show me the accounts.

896
00:44:19,234 --> 00:44:20,810
What've you been doing with
all my money?

897
00:44:20,973 --> 00:44:22,093
Have a look,

898
00:44:22,236 --> 00:44:24,516
You're just full of hot air!

899
00:44:24,816 --> 00:44:26,943
That's why I was keeping accounts.

900
00:44:26,968 --> 00:44:29,048
You handle your own accounts henceforth.

901
00:44:29,183 --> 00:44:31,380
Even your dad doesn't probe me,
but you...

902
00:44:31,445 --> 00:44:32,445
Leave it, chill...

903
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:35,511
I'll shower all my earnings
and you can spend them as you like

904
00:44:35,536 --> 00:44:38,016
I won't question you ever again.

905
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,750
But are you sure we have a shortage?

906
00:44:39,907 --> 00:44:41,307
- Hey...
- Right, leave it

907
00:44:41,856 --> 00:44:42,856
May I come in sir?

908
00:44:43,783 --> 00:44:47,223
I just got a flash about the ad,
let's talk to our MD.

909
00:44:47,248 --> 00:44:48,488
Are you kidding?

910
00:44:48,513 --> 00:44:51,233
It took me 10 years to meet MD, myself!

911
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:52,528
you seem hasty.

912
00:44:52,716 --> 00:44:55,591
Okay, what's with the FEDORA ad?

913
00:44:55,616 --> 00:44:58,336
They are making "Vitamin D enriched"
as their USP.

914
00:44:58,439 --> 00:45:00,439
- Are you quite sure about it?
- Yes sir!

915
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:04,784
Then, I'll study the formula first
and update MD later.

916
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:07,661
Not a big deal, it's calci cauliflower!
I've researched already.

917
00:45:07,724 --> 00:45:09,924
-calci what?
- calci cauliflower.

918
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:11,247
Now is the right time...

919
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:12,712
If you tell him now,

920
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:16,031
he will immediately make you one of
the board's directors

921
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:19,326
What makes you say that I aspire to be
in the board of directors?

922
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:22,071
No sir, it's my dream to have you
in the board of directors.

923
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,470
Let me talk to MD now.

924
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:29,107
You have done a good job man!

925
00:45:29,152 --> 00:45:30,857
Sir don't forget the formula please,
it's calci...

926
00:45:30,882 --> 00:45:32,842
cauliflower! God is great!

927
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,650
- May I come in sir?
-Come in Narayanan, tell me...

928
00:45:37,075 --> 00:45:40,718
Sir, I've decoded the teaser of
the New Fedora ad.

929
00:45:40,743 --> 00:45:42,143
Really? Sit down.

930
00:45:42,168 --> 00:45:45,328
It's basically a milk product.

931
00:45:45,967 --> 00:45:49,527
To avoid any confusion, I've virtually
written down the formula

932
00:45:49,552 --> 00:45:50,457
Good... good..

933
00:45:50,537 --> 00:45:52,377
It's just calci cauliflower!

934
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:55,489
Did you know something, nobody has
used this ingredient before...

935
00:45:55,514 --> 00:45:58,394
I accept that it's a milk ad..

936
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:02,808
But, bring the guy that
told you about this.

937
00:46:02,948 --> 00:46:03,636
Sir...

938
00:46:03,756 --> 00:46:04,756
Just go!

939
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,463
- Sir, he's Aadhi.
- Brand manager.

940
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:11,418
Give me the details

941
00:46:11,474 --> 00:46:16,914
There's lobbying for Vitamin D
enriched milk!

942
00:46:17,204 --> 00:46:19,035
New Fedora has planned
to capitalize on it!

943
00:46:19,168 --> 00:46:21,528
It's main ingredient is Cali Calciferol

944
00:46:21,553 --> 00:46:23,593
- Repeat that...
- Cali calciferol

945
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:28,617
But you told me it's calci cauliflower?

946
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,720
Cauliflower? What?

947
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:31,934
Yes you told me that...

948
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,599
Are you kidding me?
There's no such ingredient

949
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:40,488
You're incapable of even
repeating a formula!

950
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:42,999
- But sir...
- Please, I'll call you later.

951
00:46:45,045 --> 00:46:47,365
Arivu, Aadhi is the right mentor
for you!

952
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,510
- Errr...Sir?
- He's cunning, watch out!

953
00:46:49,775 --> 00:46:51,655
He tricked me saying
it was "Cauliflower"

954
00:46:53,806 --> 00:46:56,046
Tell me a bit about yourself.
what's your ambition?

955
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:57,311
- Your chair.
- What?

956
00:46:57,406 --> 00:46:58,726
Your chair sir.

957
00:46:58,846 --> 00:47:02,086
What's wrong with it?
Even you would've aspired for it.

958
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:03,317
Even I have the same aspirations

959
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,683
I want Saffron to be numero uno always.

960
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,220
And I want to be a prime reason for it.

961
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:11,129
We'll release a paper ad tomorrow

962
00:47:11,154 --> 00:47:14,074
stating "Vitamin D from SAFFRON"

963
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:17,095
- Look what happens!
-I'm impressed.

964
00:47:17,385 --> 00:47:18,824
Make sure the ad comes out tomorrow.

965
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,710
Sure sir, nice tie!

966
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:29,848
Shit, how did they know about our plans?

967
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:34,135
I desperately kept this a top secret,
to quell them...

968
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,809
Don't know how they found out sir.

969
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:39,301
This is how we are slipping from the top
and losing everything

970
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:41,926
Do we have a mole set up,
in their board of directors?

971
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:44,637
-Yes
-Super sir!

972
00:47:44,726 --> 00:47:47,566
I don't want this project anymore.
shut it down!

973
00:47:47,853 --> 00:47:50,173
we have invested a huge sum for it.

974
00:47:50,222 --> 00:47:52,309
if we cancel it now, it will null
our complete investment

975
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:54,534
So should I come second this time too?

976
00:47:56,094 --> 00:47:59,574
This is a matter of my ego.
I know how to handle it.

977
00:47:59,815 --> 00:48:00,775
I won't spare them

978
00:48:01,206 --> 00:48:03,086
I need more money to pay our
electricity bills.

979
00:48:03,395 --> 00:48:05,199
No amount of money seems to be
enough for you mom.

980
00:48:05,224 --> 00:48:06,464
You're corrupt!

981
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:11,119
She seems to be jolly

982
00:48:11,144 --> 00:48:14,153
Mom, you won't have to work there
from next month on.

983
00:48:14,178 --> 00:48:16,378
I'm earning well now.

984
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:19,731
Ask her to try washing vessels
in her spare time,

985
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,074
it'll come handy for her
from next month!

986
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:23,539
You shut up!

987
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:27,114
He's as such given me 5K less from
his first month's salary.

988
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:28,259
Moron!

989
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,740
It was because of GST!

990
00:48:42,782 --> 00:48:45,542
-Tell me
- Where's Kasi bro's entourage going?

991
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,087
It's his birthday today,

992
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:49,459
so he's off to seek blessings from
big boss in Kanchivaram.

993
00:48:49,484 --> 00:48:50,604
He'll be back only tonight.

994
00:48:50,629 --> 00:48:52,509
-Is everybody from the gang going?
-Yes.

995
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:59,641
What are you looking for?
Tell me.

996
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:02,106
Ask our boys to distribute this
to every house...

997
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:03,392
Pass it over there...

998
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:08,854
Here, read it.

999
00:49:10,956 --> 00:49:12,716
Arivu asked me to give these

1000
00:49:21,678 --> 00:49:23,438
I was waiting for this day to come.

1001
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:25,264
Only I know how hard it was,

1002
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:29,129
to restrain my thoughts
in spite of launching this radio.

1003
00:49:29,263 --> 00:49:33,663
If you believe in my intentions and
concern for you people,

1004
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,784
then listen attentively.

1005
00:49:35,982 --> 00:49:39,553
Government officials visited our slum
3 years ago,

1006
00:49:39,624 --> 00:49:42,904
Kasi bro warned us that
they were here to out us!

1007
00:49:42,929 --> 00:49:45,449
So we fought them and
also celebrated Kasi bro

1008
00:49:45,474 --> 00:49:47,914
But they weren't here for that,

1009
00:49:48,483 --> 00:49:50,451
they were here to register the land
in our names.

1010
00:49:50,568 --> 00:49:51,768
Hard to believe right?

1011
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:55,247
What you have now...
is the copy of the registration order

1012
00:49:56,197 --> 00:49:57,545
If it had happened then,

1013
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,610
by now we would've got
all the basic amenities

1014
00:49:59,635 --> 00:50:01,075
like food, ration, water, drainage, road!

1015
00:50:01,193 --> 00:50:03,353
we would've gotten easy loans from banks
pledging our land

1016
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:07,218
and used it for educating our children,
for marriage, house, business

1017
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,920
or even used it to save someone's life.

1018
00:50:09,086 --> 00:50:11,076
So if we get all these amenities,

1019
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:14,379
Kasi is paranoid that he may lose
his foothold among us

1020
00:50:14,606 --> 00:50:17,846
and hence thwarted it.

1021
00:50:18,237 --> 00:50:20,764
He has created an illusion that
we need him for our survival

1022
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:24,269
I've broken free from the shackles
and wish the same for you.

1023
00:50:24,294 --> 00:50:27,574
we are confined to a whale's back
thinking it's an island.

1024
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,599
We have to wake up before
it swallows us!

1025
00:50:29,624 --> 00:50:34,824
Inspite of all this, if someone wants
to rat me out to Kasi

1026
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,071
I don't care.

1027
00:50:37,096 --> 00:50:38,795
I don't want this place
to be jinxed anymore.

1028
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,820
It's high time we take a call!

1029
00:50:41,073 --> 00:50:43,897
We shouldn't let even one more person
to transform into a gangster

1030
00:50:43,972 --> 00:50:47,252
we have to retrieve other members
from him as well

1031
00:50:48,022 --> 00:50:50,444
Our kids should be educated,
get good jobs

1032
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:51,749
and reach great heights!

1033
00:50:52,156 --> 00:50:55,795
If you're ready and believe
you need this change

1034
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,460
if you want to emerge to light,
from darkness

1035
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:03,399
Switch on your lights at midnight!

1036
00:51:04,473 --> 00:51:06,713
Enough of putting up with circumstances

1037
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,270
It's time to change tides in our favor

1038
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,103
I believe you will switch the lights on!

1039
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:17,656
The choicest word in the world is "DEED"

1040
00:51:53,928 --> 00:51:56,688
-Who's it?
- It's me, one of your fan listeners!

1041
00:51:57,584 --> 00:52:00,144
Scared? Thought I was Kasi is it?

1042
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,390
-Why aren't you asleep yet?
- Asleep?

1043
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:06,615
How can I sleep when such an
interesting thing is about to happen?!

1044
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:09,375
My life seems interesting enough
for you?

1045
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,436
Do you really think they'll switch
their lights on for you

1046
00:52:11,474 --> 00:52:12,434
at such an odd hour?

1047
00:52:12,488 --> 00:52:14,772
I told them to do that to see
how much support

1048
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:15,997
I have amidst them!

1049
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,678
If they support me,
I'll struggle with them...

1050
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:21,823
If not I'll fight for it, alone!

1051
00:52:23,252 --> 00:52:25,172
Oh, it's Kasi!

1052
00:52:25,197 --> 00:52:31,928
Kasi please, he didn't do it intentionally,
Sorry.

1053
00:52:31,953 --> 00:52:33,313
You please hide inside.

1054
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:39,606
Did you go on air,
in spite of my warning?

1055
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:40,576
Heard it from your mom!

1056
00:52:40,601 --> 00:52:42,126
Bro, I have so many things
to tell you...

1057
00:52:42,151 --> 00:52:44,631
What did you say on the radio,
say that first!

1058
00:52:45,303 --> 00:52:46,764
- Didn't my mom tell you?
-What?

1059
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:50,109
The LIVE relay became a total mess,

1060
00:52:50,296 --> 00:52:51,709
and you got so pissed and
scolded everyone.

1061
00:52:51,734 --> 00:52:53,444
So to make up for it...

1062
00:52:53,569 --> 00:52:56,436
I wanted everyone to switch on
their lights at midnight,

1063
00:52:56,461 --> 00:52:57,621
to surprise you!

1064
00:52:57,781 --> 00:52:58,678
That's why I spoke on the radio.

1065
00:52:58,703 --> 00:53:02,076
Why would you plan this surprise
at the end of my birthday?

1066
00:53:02,101 --> 00:53:06,981
It's a clichÃ© to blow candles
at midnight!

1067
00:53:07,283 --> 00:53:09,490
But I wanted to do
something different...

1068
00:53:09,515 --> 00:53:11,733
and wanted your birthday to end
on a bright note.

1069
00:53:11,828 --> 00:53:13,748
Thus I came up with the plan!

1070
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,453
Sounds good!

1071
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:18,281
What's the time?

1072
00:53:19,215 --> 00:53:21,015
3 minutes to go...

1073
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,000
I'll slash their throats if they
don't switch those lights on!

1074
00:53:26,025 --> 00:53:29,825
I myself will update you
tomorrow brother!

1075
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,407
Kasi is the KING!

1076
00:54:45,895 --> 00:54:47,655
This is my friend Bhagya.

1077
00:54:47,863 --> 00:54:49,489
Please offer him a job.

1078
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:50,410
Citing him,...

1079
00:54:50,482 --> 00:54:53,362
I'll be able to change the mindset
of felons in my slums.

1080
00:54:53,387 --> 00:54:54,667
Sample marketing?

1081
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:57,208
Today's lesson learnt from you.

1082
00:54:57,298 --> 00:54:59,218
Now that you have told me the problem,

1083
00:54:59,288 --> 00:55:00,728
Let me talk to Bhagya

1084
00:55:01,086 --> 00:55:02,122
You wait outside.

1085
00:55:02,147 --> 00:55:03,107
No sir...

1086
00:55:03,312 --> 00:55:06,072
- He's very short-tempered
- I insist...

1087
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:09,952
Hey Bhagya, mind your words!

1088
00:55:11,256 --> 00:55:13,864
What he says is right,
I'm very gruff

1089
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:15,793
Incase of any brawls I get violent

1090
00:55:15,888 --> 00:55:17,208
I'm not suited for your
white-collared job

1091
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:18,233
Look out for someone else!

1092
00:55:18,258 --> 00:55:22,218
You are gonna do the same job
you did for Kasi

1093
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:26,769
But in the guise of a delivery boy,
with a salary

1094
00:55:26,855 --> 00:55:28,231
- Okay?
- Yes sir

1095
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:30,200
It was a big deal to get him
to take this job

1096
00:55:30,225 --> 00:55:32,825
Don't worry, it's my responsibility
to make him work.

1097
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:35,004
I knew good times were coming,...

1098
00:55:35,029 --> 00:55:37,949
right on the night you asked us to
switch on the lights.

1099
00:55:38,608 --> 00:55:40,247
It was surprising for me as well

1100
00:55:40,272 --> 00:55:42,632
Never expected everyone's support

1101
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:44,879
It's a token of respect
for your kind heart.

1102
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:49,537
Why else would a totally unrelated girl
rally for you here?

1103
00:55:50,317 --> 00:55:51,012
Who?

1104
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:53,077
This girl, Mrinalini ...

1105
00:55:53,261 --> 00:55:56,223
She said that you're right,
and can be trusted,...

1106
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:59,391
and asked us to switch on
those lights boldly.

1107
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:05,570
- Hello
- Sriram, sir

1108
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:06,606
Tell me

1109
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:10,151
- What's Mrinalini' type?
- Damn, she's my cousin man!

1110
00:56:10,176 --> 00:56:12,520
- I'm not trying to flirt
- Then?

1111
00:56:12,545 --> 00:56:15,465
She has helped me by rallying for me
in my slum

1112
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:16,490
That's Mrinalini.

1113
00:56:16,554 --> 00:56:19,274
It's her misfortune that she's
looked upon as mad and peevish!

1114
00:56:19,299 --> 00:56:21,379
Then what did she
talk like that on TV?

1115
00:56:21,456 --> 00:56:25,616
She did the documentary to show
those girls in a positive light...

1116
00:56:25,641 --> 00:56:28,961
and tried to change the
bad perception on them

1117
00:56:29,032 --> 00:56:31,712
Which is why she agreed to
talk on the show!

1118
00:56:31,737 --> 00:56:33,977
But they made her a scapegoat
to generate TRPs

1119
00:56:34,002 --> 00:56:36,002
She's hurt for trying to do
the right thing.

1120
00:56:36,027 --> 00:56:37,187
I am also hurt her

1121
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:39,119
Just do me a favor.

1122
00:56:39,144 --> 00:56:41,744
These are the phone numbers of 6 girls
whom married those idiots

1123
00:56:41,877 --> 00:56:43,957
Let's put it on speaker

1124
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:46,348
- Hello!
- Weren't you part of the reality show?

1125
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:48,122
That's how we got your husband's
number & yours.

1126
00:56:48,147 --> 00:56:51,747
He's not my husband,
it was just pretense!

1127
00:56:51,871 --> 00:56:55,591
- What are you saying?
- Nandini & myself were there

1128
00:56:55,616 --> 00:56:57,576
So 2 of them were frauds!

1129
00:56:57,601 --> 00:56:58,481
Hello!

1130
00:56:58,506 --> 00:57:00,887
Congratulations, your husband and you
have just won a trip to Bangkok

1131
00:57:00,912 --> 00:57:02,552
Did you get the message?

1132
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,480
We're getting a divorce, what the hell
do you expect us to do in Bangkok?

1133
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,379
Ma'am don't hang up, let me come
with you for a sandwich massage!

1134
00:57:10,404 --> 00:57:11,444
Super sir.

1135
00:57:11,624 --> 00:57:13,793
She's telling the truth
to a stranger on the phone

1136
00:57:13,818 --> 00:57:15,458
- What if we go to her house?
- Sir!

1137
00:57:15,497 --> 00:57:17,177
She'll spill the beans

1138
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:18,090
Yay!

1139
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:19,995
My husband is a pervert

1140
00:57:20,096 --> 00:57:24,456
He keeps taking photographs
and videos of all the women.

1141
00:57:24,576 --> 00:57:29,403
He even took a video
of Mrinalini's speech

1142
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:32,148
- Do you have it?
- Yes the entire speech.

1143
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:36,016
Matriarchy was the origin
of our society.

1144
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:38,041
Go read Volga to Ganga.

1145
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:41,247
Women were the ultimate
decision makers.

1146
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:44,668
Infact, she can even choose
her partner for every night

1147
00:57:44,977 --> 00:57:47,051
Are you okay to reintroduce
that culture?

1148
00:57:47,076 --> 00:57:50,636
We have the freedom to do anything,
but we won't misuse it

1149
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:54,878
Because we know the importance of
freedom and it's limits.

1150
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:59,103
Periyar was significant in fighting
for women's rights

1151
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,560
We respect him and every other man
who supports true empowerment!

1152
00:58:04,951 --> 00:58:06,511
This is the real Mrinalini.

1153
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:09,792
Everyone should see her true face.

1154
00:58:12,215 --> 00:58:14,135
- Tell me
- Did you checkout Facebook?

1155
00:58:14,176 --> 00:58:16,936
- No, why?
- Go see it

1156
00:58:19,328 --> 00:58:22,048
It's cheap to exploit women

1157
00:58:22,073 --> 00:58:26,273
But it's even cheaper
to exploit their problems!

1158
00:58:26,345 --> 00:58:28,745
Did you tell me they were coming?

1159
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:33,330
The channel asked us to
pretend as a happy couple

1160
00:58:33,433 --> 00:58:36,393
Mrinalini warned us that
this would end badly

1161
00:58:36,418 --> 00:58:39,378
And the channel showed
her in bad light.

1162
00:58:39,457 --> 00:58:41,497
I wanna apologise to Mrinalini!

1163
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:46,206
Sister, we're really sorry
we made a mess at the hostel

1164
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,820
You spoke the truth
Hats off Ma'am!

1165
00:58:48,876 --> 00:58:50,848
- Did you see it?
- How did this happen?

1166
00:58:50,873 --> 00:58:52,033
Because of Arivu.

1167
00:58:52,248 --> 00:58:55,481
"Hey heartthrob,
what did you do to me?"

1168
00:58:56,262 --> 00:59:00,142
"Happy moments caressed me"

1169
00:59:00,325 --> 00:59:04,309
"Hey heartthrob,
what did you do to me?"

1170
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:07,054
"You made my nights glitter!"

1171
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:11,279
"My horizons widen,
as my perspective transforms"

1172
00:59:11,304 --> 00:59:14,864
"I seem to know you
wiped away my sins!"

1173
00:59:15,092 --> 00:59:17,355
"As lies drift apart"

1174
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,180
"The truth shines!"

1175
00:59:19,205 --> 00:59:22,845
"My lips utter
you are my confidante!"

1176
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:27,230
"The world transforms
and imparts colours"

1177
00:59:27,255 --> 00:59:30,775
"My heart says
you're my true love!"

1178
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:34,645
"There's nobody like you on earth"

1179
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:37,340
"I love you without boundaries"

1180
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,405
- Arivu Bro...
- How's business, little boy?

1181
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:41,967
Superb, bro
All flowers were sold out.

1182
00:59:41,992 --> 00:59:44,752
- Why are you still here then?
- I have one yard left.

1183
00:59:44,777 --> 00:59:47,098
- So?
- Buy this for your wife.

1184
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:49,738
She isn't my wife.

1185
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:52,454
Unmarried?
Then get this for your lover.

1186
00:59:53,407 --> 00:59:55,856
- No way!
- One night stand is it?

1187
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:58,041
- I'll kill you.
- She looks gorgeous bro!

1188
00:59:58,104 --> 00:59:59,624
As if I didn't know it

1189
00:59:59,649 --> 01:00:01,434
I swear I didn't teach him
to talk like this

1190
01:00:01,459 --> 01:00:04,099
He made up the truth on his own

1191
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:13,343
Medicines cost us 4000, clothes 300,
transport 350, rice 650 bucks...

1192
01:00:13,368 --> 01:00:16,088
Mom, I don't care about the math

1193
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:18,895
Just swipe this card and take
how much ever is available.

1194
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,120
That's all I have.

1195
01:00:21,337 --> 01:00:22,657
What sort of an answer is that?

1196
01:00:22,682 --> 01:00:24,522
Why're you so dull?

1197
01:00:24,656 --> 01:00:26,616
I snapped at mom today

1198
01:00:26,695 --> 01:00:27,615
What for?

1199
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,720
No amount of money seems enough

1200
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:33,951
We didn't face this even when
dad earned less.

1201
01:00:33,976 --> 01:00:39,016
I earn thrice his salary,
yet it's not enough!

1202
01:00:39,518 --> 01:00:41,758
Don't know where the money goes.

1203
01:00:41,884 --> 01:00:43,911
Meanwhile the land officer said

1204
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:45,976
We'll get our registration
only after 6 months.

1205
01:00:46,001 --> 01:00:50,721
What? Better stay away
from Kasi till then!

1206
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,560
You be careful

1207
01:00:53,711 --> 01:00:55,895
I heard he's been
enquiring about you everywhere

1208
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,920
I heard it too.

1209
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,519
Anyway we made a decision,
let's face it.

1210
01:01:01,647 --> 01:01:02,767
Madam!

1211
01:01:04,434 --> 01:01:05,594
Okay sure.

1212
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:08,637
Can I come in sir?

1213
01:01:08,975 --> 01:01:10,015
Yes! Please

1214
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:11,270
What's up?

1215
01:01:11,582 --> 01:01:15,262
I'm feeling worn out running
behind sales targets

1216
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,215
I wanted to recharge myself
with your motivation.

1217
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,960
I'm motivating myself too

1218
01:01:20,034 --> 01:01:21,674
What do you mean?

1219
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:25,079
Look here, they are leading
companies in food industries

1220
01:01:25,104 --> 01:01:28,864
He's changed the trend of buying it
in exclusive ice-cream shops

1221
01:01:28,982 --> 01:01:30,662
They've distributed free freezer boxes

1222
01:01:30,743 --> 01:01:33,983
To all small shops and made it
accessible to everybody.

1223
01:01:34,088 --> 01:01:36,973
Starr masala Mix, they have understood
the pulse of women...

1224
01:01:36,998 --> 01:01:39,158
and introduced an instant masala!

1225
01:01:40,272 --> 01:01:41,712
So they are the winners!

1226
01:01:41,737 --> 01:01:43,777
The problems may vary

1227
01:01:44,014 --> 01:01:47,574
But we have to come up with
creative solutions every single day!

1228
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,080
That's marketing!

1229
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:55,493
Tell me Bhagya

1230
01:01:55,518 --> 01:01:57,278
Arivu, Kasi is chasing me.

1231
01:01:57,524 --> 01:02:00,444
- Where are you?
- In our godown, come soon

1232
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:11,334
Bro, what's this?

1233
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,919
What?

1234
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:18,573
Hey, Bhagya...

1235
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:25,712
Hey Bhagya

1236
01:02:25,737 --> 01:02:27,059
Hey...hey...Bhagya

1237
01:02:27,084 --> 01:02:30,404
Don't worry,
You're okay Bhagya...

1238
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:38,605
Bhagya...Bhagya

1239
01:02:44,045 --> 01:02:47,405
How could you kill our own guy?

1240
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:52,749
Hey Ba****d, Kasi...

1241
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:39,934
You killed my friend
because he left you.

1242
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:45,831
You made killing your livelihood,
but now you ought to die!

1243
01:03:47,543 --> 01:03:51,743
They'll break in anytime now
and they're gonna slash you

1244
01:03:51,768 --> 01:03:54,608
After your death, we'll prove
to the world that

1245
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:57,149
We are not crooks,
but hard workers

1246
01:03:57,391 --> 01:03:58,551
We'll prove it

1247
01:03:58,725 --> 01:04:03,925
You're a slimy asshole that'd do
anything for money!

1248
01:04:04,911 --> 01:04:06,411
Why're you still alive?
Die...die

1249
01:04:06,436 --> 01:04:08,396
Rot in hell, you thug!

1250
01:04:11,326 --> 01:04:15,726
I didn't kill Bhagya by myself,
it was also you!

1251
01:04:17,456 --> 01:04:19,816
What the hell are you saying?

1252
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:22,990
Your boss assigned me to kill Bhagya.

1253
01:04:24,255 --> 01:04:30,055
Both of us have the same boss
and the same job

1254
01:04:30,718 --> 01:04:32,158
What are you looking at?

1255
01:04:32,183 --> 01:04:36,223
Do you even know about
the product you sell?

1256
01:04:37,277 --> 01:04:39,037
It's poison!

1257
01:04:39,511 --> 01:04:43,031
You are killing everyone by
feeding them poison

1258
01:04:43,855 --> 01:04:50,015
I at least know why I kill people
and why I'm dying,

1259
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:56,887
But you've no idea who you are killing
and who might kill you.

1260
01:04:57,913 --> 01:05:00,033
Your company will sell its poison,...

1261
01:05:00,751 --> 01:05:03,991
and a woman named Kasturi will
file a suit against it

1262
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:10,190
Bhagya will save her, as per plan.

1263
01:05:10,286 --> 01:05:12,046
Nab his phone.

1264
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:18,351
Jeyram, you can't escape this time.

1265
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:20,753
I'll not spare you nor your company

1266
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:23,958
And I'll kill him on behalf
of the company.

1267
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:25,770
Kasi

1268
01:05:27,487 --> 01:05:33,167
If I follow their orders,
you think I'm a criminal

1269
01:05:33,288 --> 01:05:36,928
But if you do the same you call yourself
a proud worker!

1270
01:05:37,085 --> 01:05:38,125
Hypocrite!

1271
01:05:38,487 --> 01:05:40,887
We're on the same boat

1272
01:05:41,463 --> 01:05:43,263
Just a tinge of difference...

1273
01:05:43,288 --> 01:05:45,688
they pay me wages,
whereas they pay you a salary!

1274
01:05:45,869 --> 01:05:48,909
If I'm a hit man, then who are you?

1275
01:05:49,215 --> 01:05:51,295
You are an even more ruthless hit man!

1276
01:05:52,464 --> 01:06:00,064
If you say that I eat shit for money,
then you're doing the same thing too!

1277
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,900
Our boss is calling me

1278
01:06:11,647 --> 01:06:12,176
Hello

1279
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,361
Kasi, what happened?

1280
01:06:13,648 --> 01:06:15,048
Did you finish off Bhagya?

1281
01:06:16,502 --> 01:06:17,622
I did.

1282
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,170
Good

1283
01:06:19,195 --> 01:06:22,315
He'll live a 100 years,
we're the ill-fated ones.

1284
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:26,500
Go fool, go on...
Today is Fool's day!

1285
01:06:28,054 --> 01:06:31,014
The entire world celebrates
without knowing why

1286
01:06:32,523 --> 01:06:35,778
But you are the fool that
truly deserves to celebrate this!

1287
01:06:35,803 --> 01:06:37,203
The best fool!

1288
01:06:39,318 --> 01:06:41,638
Go fool, go

1289
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:58,246
He killed Bhagya before I could reach

1290
01:06:58,879 --> 01:07:00,279
How did you miss it?

1291
01:07:00,366 --> 01:07:02,846
Saffron is top-notch not just
in the market

1292
01:07:03,075 --> 01:07:06,270
But also in manufacturing
dangerous substances!

1293
01:07:06,295 --> 01:07:09,655
"Oh my God!"

1294
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:12,012
Arivu, we'll handle everything

1295
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:14,551
Don't get caught up in things
Just leave!

1296
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:17,293
Hello, tell me Arivu

1297
01:07:17,318 --> 01:07:18,598
I want to see you

1298
01:07:18,695 --> 01:07:20,145
I'll come to your home

1299
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:25,370
"My dearie God
Be with me as my guide"

1300
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:29,008
Do you even know about
the product you sell?

1301
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:30,614
It's poison!

1302
01:07:31,288 --> 01:07:34,530
We're doing the same job
for your company!

1303
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:39,218
"You are the one who curse me"

1304
01:07:39,243 --> 01:07:43,083
They pay me wages,
whereas they pay you a salary

1305
01:07:46,597 --> 01:07:47,515
What's this?

1306
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,780
We were about to fuck up

1307
01:07:48,842 --> 01:07:50,530
But Prem saved the day
by killing those people!

1308
01:07:50,555 --> 01:07:52,595
I can bet on you, my boy!

1309
01:07:53,097 --> 01:07:54,897
So far in my career...

1310
01:07:55,093 --> 01:07:57,124
never seen such an ace
target achiever like him!

1311
01:07:57,149 --> 01:08:01,509
"Can't bearable if we lost our beloved"

1312
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,200
Our kids should be well educated
and achieve their dreams

1313
01:08:07,225 --> 01:08:09,625
No more thugs should emerge,
from among us!

1314
01:08:10,445 --> 01:08:13,005
If I'm a hitman, then who are you?

1315
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:15,226
You are an ever more ruthless hitman!

1316
01:08:15,251 --> 01:08:16,611
Fool!

1317
01:08:16,908 --> 01:08:18,468
You are only questioning me

1318
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:20,133
Call me in case of any problem

1319
01:08:20,338 --> 01:08:22,498
Or the company's number given
on the card.

1320
01:08:22,523 --> 01:08:24,905
Arivu, this guy had a look
at our TV problem...

1321
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:26,410
and recommended installing this.

1322
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,835
Else it would have been
a total loss for us.

1323
01:08:29,046 --> 01:08:31,286
He had one last product,
and sold it to us

1324
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:35,831
It costs 4000, instead he sold it
for a discount.

1325
01:08:35,856 --> 01:08:37,416
Middle class guys have
the same mindset

1326
01:08:37,896 --> 01:08:40,336
We can't sell even essentials
at the end of the month

1327
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:43,001
But we can sell even unnecessary items,
if we approach them on the 1st!

1328
01:08:43,026 --> 01:08:44,146
Tomorrow is an auspicious day

1329
01:08:44,171 --> 01:08:46,411
There will be a huge crowd gathered for
the wedding in the next lane

1330
01:08:46,436 --> 01:08:48,916
The guests will be dolled up
with jewellery.

1331
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:51,981
We can easily rob a handful of gold!

1332
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,187
We can exploit people
until they have fear

1333
01:08:55,212 --> 01:08:59,092
We can con people using
their own greed!

1334
01:09:00,751 --> 01:09:01,991
- Sir!
- Sir!

1335
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,374
Come in for a minute.

1336
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:05,399
- Why sir?
- Come in

1337
01:09:06,327 --> 01:09:08,167
No formalities on hospitality please.

1338
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,190
Sit down.

1339
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:12,695
Is a stabilizer mandatory for an LED?

1340
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,160
Yes, else it would burst
during voltage fluctuations.

1341
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,192
- Hey dude...
- Tell

1342
01:09:18,217 --> 01:09:19,999
Didn't you work with an
LED brand before?

1343
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:20,794
Yes!

1344
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:23,170
- Is a stabilizer mandatory?
- Not really.

1345
01:09:23,272 --> 01:09:25,872
- Wouldn't the TV burst, without it?
- Which fool said so?

1346
01:09:25,897 --> 01:09:27,897
Someone is trying to con you,
be careful.

1347
01:09:28,068 --> 01:09:30,828
- Where are you?
- Nearby in the tea shop.

1348
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:33,208
- Are the guys around?
- Yes

1349
01:09:33,371 --> 01:09:34,577
Could you come over to my house.
It's urgent.

1350
01:09:34,602 --> 01:09:35,442
Okay!

1351
01:09:35,582 --> 01:09:36,782
Now tell me.

1352
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,160
Is a stabilizer really
required for this TV?

1353
01:09:41,185 --> 01:09:44,065
- Arivu, what are you doing?
- Mom, stay out of it, I'll handle it.

1354
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:45,570
Vani, go inside

1355
01:09:45,703 --> 01:09:49,023
It seems I'm a hit man. I'll kill you.

1356
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:50,493
Sit down

1357
01:09:53,464 --> 01:09:56,704
Now, is a stabilizer really
required for this TV?

1358
01:09:56,729 --> 01:09:57,929
Not really.

1359
01:10:00,623 --> 01:10:03,983
So you have sold a useless product
to so many people

1360
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:05,319
Why?

1361
01:10:05,461 --> 01:10:07,341
Monthly targets, that's why!

1362
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:11,526
While I run around to meet my targets,
you snatch mine from right under my nose

1363
01:10:11,598 --> 01:10:13,318
So who do I snatch it from again?

1364
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:14,842
Why are you running around
for someone else's targets?

1365
01:10:14,867 --> 01:10:16,014
Arivu, what's this?

1366
01:10:16,237 --> 01:10:18,795
Mom, I'm not talking to him,
I'm reflecting upon myself

1367
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:20,146
He's just like me mom.

1368
01:10:20,171 --> 01:10:21,571
- Aren't you?
- Yes sir.

1369
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:24,196
- Do you live in a similar house?
- Yes sir!

1370
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,930
Then why are you stealing from here?

1371
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,280
- Remove your shoe
- Why?

1372
01:10:30,454 --> 01:10:31,814
Just do what I say.

1373
01:10:34,118 --> 01:10:36,758
Oh, your sock is torn near the thumb?

1374
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,719
It's the pinky finger for me.

1375
01:10:40,886 --> 01:10:42,126
Why didn't you buy a new pair?

1376
01:10:42,151 --> 01:10:44,365
I exceeded my monthly budgets

1377
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:47,281
So you couldn't buy socks?
What else did you buy then?

1378
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:51,279
A refrigerator and a TV on EMI.

1379
01:10:52,797 --> 01:10:55,397
There are people to sell
exorbitant stuffs

1380
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:58,070
But there's none to sell
essential things.

1381
01:11:01,514 --> 01:11:02,162
What's this?

1382
01:11:02,615 --> 01:11:04,745
Energy drink.

1383
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:05,740
Will your highness drink only this?

1384
01:11:05,765 --> 01:11:08,605
- It has 8 vitamins...
- It has 12 chemicals!

1385
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,800
You're just a leech

1386
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,701
But I'm a blood sucking parasite!

1387
01:11:13,726 --> 01:11:15,566
I'm selling this poison.

1388
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:18,150
Hey, what happened?

1389
01:11:18,749 --> 01:11:21,949
He is the one who sold
the stablizer for my LED

1390
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,640
How dare you con a fellow salesman?

1391
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:28,345
Show your mettle elsewhere.

1392
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:30,930
Why won't you?

1393
01:11:31,136 --> 01:11:36,016
You change jobs every month
and babble nonsense

1394
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:39,161
You have no clue what you sell,
but you are desperate to sell it somehow

1395
01:11:39,264 --> 01:11:43,984
This guy over here, overcharges
his client for theft insurance

1396
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:47,329
And bragged that nobody cares
to lodge a complaint in case of a theft.

1397
01:11:47,354 --> 01:11:51,514
Even if they do, it's a meagre 5%,
so the rest are profits.

1398
01:11:51,694 --> 01:11:53,818
I laughed hearing you say that,
the other day.

1399
01:11:53,912 --> 01:11:54,712
Hey...

1400
01:11:55,567 --> 01:11:56,967
A million people like us,...

1401
01:11:57,014 --> 01:11:59,732
having no idea about the product,
rush off to sell it...

1402
01:11:59,942 --> 01:12:01,542
to poor schmucks

1403
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,807
But what we don't realise is,
we're doing it to ourselves.

1404
01:12:05,838 --> 01:12:10,038
If I earn 10 bucks,
somebody cons me for 20.

1405
01:12:10,607 --> 01:12:13,927
He sold me this water purifier

1406
01:12:14,124 --> 01:12:15,490
Assured me there would be no problems

1407
01:12:15,515 --> 01:12:17,662
But there is a problem every damn week.

1408
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:18,906
That table over there

1409
01:12:19,048 --> 01:12:23,728
They dumped it on me
using popular marketing!

1410
01:12:25,347 --> 01:12:28,667
Would it be possible to see this
in elite areas?

1411
01:12:29,007 --> 01:12:32,295
When I wondered how money was always
insufficient in spite of earning so much

1412
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,600
I realised I was getting conned
left, right & centre!

1413
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:39,896
True, we are bunkos!

1414
01:12:40,061 --> 01:12:44,181
How many of you can say that
you have been truthful?

1415
01:12:44,373 --> 01:12:45,613
Answer me guys

1416
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:51,079
We haven't been selling goods,
we're selling lies

1417
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:54,647
Traders have exceeded
manufacturers now

1418
01:12:54,672 --> 01:12:56,432
Knowing that they can sell anything,...

1419
01:12:56,457 --> 01:12:58,576
they have started manufacturing
shitty goods.

1420
01:12:58,601 --> 01:13:01,081
Enough of this shit!

1421
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:02,879
I don't need this money.

1422
01:13:03,037 --> 01:13:05,677
Whether or not you understood, I did!

1423
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:09,998
Mom, please give me my debit card

1424
01:13:10,024 --> 01:13:11,864
- Why?
- Just give it to me.

1425
01:13:19,406 --> 01:13:21,726
I don't want to pay my sister's fees
with this money

1426
01:13:21,751 --> 01:13:25,751
She won't be allowed to write her exams
if we don't pay tomorrow

1427
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:28,656
I'll arrange it somehow, but not this

1428
01:13:28,681 --> 01:13:30,641
What the hell are you doing Arivu?

1429
01:13:30,927 --> 01:13:33,207
What do you expect me to do?

1430
01:13:33,654 --> 01:13:35,614
You tell me that our family will be
ruined if I don't work

1431
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:36,311
But another guy is telling me that

1432
01:13:36,336 --> 01:13:38,336
I'm ruining other families because
of my work!

1433
01:13:38,621 --> 01:13:40,381
I don't know what to do

1434
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:43,620
Let me think

1435
01:13:45,366 --> 01:13:47,206
Hang on guys

1436
01:13:47,836 --> 01:13:48,836
Stop...

1437
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:04,373
- Arivu, what happened?
- Everything's gone!

1438
01:14:06,415 --> 01:14:08,975
I wanted to save my friend Bhagya,...

1439
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:11,247
but people are saying I've killed him.

1440
01:14:11,343 --> 01:14:13,383
Kasi, who I wanted to kill...

1441
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:15,110
I've saved him instead!

1442
01:14:15,823 --> 01:14:18,583
I've lost sight of my life.

1443
01:14:20,347 --> 01:14:21,841
I feel ashamed.

1444
01:14:21,866 --> 01:14:24,426
Arivu, why are you talking like this?

1445
01:14:26,152 --> 01:14:28,912
What you achieved here is no mean feat!

1446
01:14:29,195 --> 01:14:32,995
You can come out of this quicker
than you think.

1447
01:14:33,112 --> 01:14:34,872
I won't run away from this

1448
01:14:34,935 --> 01:14:37,015
I'll do something big!

1449
01:14:39,606 --> 01:14:41,486
I've given you so much time already

1450
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:43,431
There's no improvement.

1451
01:14:43,876 --> 01:14:46,876
My plan is not only to make
New Fedora number one

1452
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:49,550
But also sign a merger with Saffron.

1453
01:14:49,654 --> 01:14:51,854
Merger? Are you joking?

1454
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:53,583
How's it possible?

1455
01:14:53,608 --> 01:14:55,488
My son will make it possible.

1456
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:15,678
Hi Mr.Steve

1457
01:15:16,005 --> 01:15:18,677
Let me first brief you about
Saffron's SWOT analysis;

1458
01:15:18,702 --> 01:15:21,222
You can then decide if you want
to meet Jeyaram.

1459
01:15:21,247 --> 01:15:23,407
3 people from our slum have died today.

1460
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:27,645
Babu & Syed were killed because
they were part of a gang

1461
01:15:28,605 --> 01:15:35,285
But Bhagya died because
he turned over a new leaf

1462
01:15:36,651 --> 01:15:38,958
Just as when I thought people here
were in the wrong jobs

1463
01:15:38,983 --> 01:15:41,663
For worse people outside are doing
their entire jobs wrongly

1464
01:15:41,936 --> 01:15:45,456
One tells me to work hard, the other
tells me to work smart,

1465
01:15:45,873 --> 01:15:47,953
But nobody told me what good work is?

1466
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:50,466
If we could make a small progress
in stature now,...

1467
01:15:50,491 --> 01:15:53,251
...I thought at least the next generation
would dream big.

1468
01:15:53,515 --> 01:15:58,595
Atleast we're better, we know
we belong in a low class.

1469
01:15:58,831 --> 01:16:00,747
But the middle class people are doomed!

1470
01:16:00,772 --> 01:16:03,092
They are tricked by false hopes...

1471
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:06,193
Disguised as one of the workers,...

1472
01:16:06,218 --> 01:16:09,258
I could understand the
middle class' mentality.

1473
01:16:09,493 --> 01:16:11,747
They'll even buy poison,
if it's on discount.

1474
01:16:11,792 --> 01:16:15,952
We need to identify the elites
responsible for this

1475
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:19,230
Though I'm born with silver spoon,
but I hid my identity

1476
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:22,607
The reason why I worked
in some company for monthly salary...

1477
01:16:22,632 --> 01:16:24,872
Not only Safforn company

1478
01:16:25,086 --> 01:16:27,126
To get whole food industry

1479
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,708
Our mistakes will affect only us

1480
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,080
But an elite's mistake will ruin
the entire society

1481
01:16:32,283 --> 01:16:33,919
If my plan works well,...

1482
01:16:33,944 --> 01:16:36,824
we can make them spend 100 bucks
from their pockets every day.

1483
01:16:36,897 --> 01:16:38,817
Thugs are just those who kill people

1484
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:41,681
We're thugs even if we affect
others unintentionally.

1485
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:45,528
Some countries have resources,
some have foolish people

1486
01:16:45,758 --> 01:16:48,198
But India is a combination of both

1487
01:16:48,463 --> 01:16:50,247
Yes, it was me who said we can
progress if we work hard

1488
01:16:50,321 --> 01:16:53,121
Correct, but the progress happens
to someone else, not us!

1489
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:56,119
Being a foreigner if you think
you understand it better

1490
01:16:56,277 --> 01:16:58,637
Being within the country
I understand it even better.

1491
01:16:58,662 --> 01:17:02,138
They're exploiting our poverty
to make us run behind targets.

1492
01:17:02,416 --> 01:17:04,656
They don't even give us time
to introspect.

1493
01:17:04,927 --> 01:17:06,207
Even I don't have the time

1494
01:17:06,256 --> 01:17:07,296
I'm poor too

1495
01:17:07,321 --> 01:17:09,001
But I'm gonna take a break

1496
01:17:09,086 --> 01:17:11,857
My target is to make everyone
understand that...

1497
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:14,482
...they aren't working ethically!

1498
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,000
Today is April 1st, fools day

1499
01:17:17,188 --> 01:17:20,052
Someone told me I was the
world's best fool!

1500
01:17:20,233 --> 01:17:21,273
I'll accept that.

1501
01:17:21,344 --> 01:17:23,424
But May 1st is Labour day;

1502
01:17:23,662 --> 01:17:26,351
I'l prove that I'm the
world's best worker!

1503
01:17:26,427 --> 01:17:30,547
The next time we meet, I'll make you
an offer you can't refuse!

1504
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:34,990
The world's most unparalleled word
is "DEED"!

1505
01:17:35,478 --> 01:17:36,958
I'll prove it!

1506
01:17:49,278 --> 01:17:54,518
"Who would we call to
rock our golden cradle?"

1507
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:59,890
"Who would we call
to replace you?"

1508
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:02,290
"we were unified by soul"

1509
01:18:02,315 --> 01:18:04,515
"we shared this life"

1510
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:08,690
"Bhagya, my friend
you deserted me"

1511
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,469
"...to rest in peace!"

1512
01:18:10,494 --> 01:18:14,774
"we await your resurgence"

1513
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,926
He will have a fear of killing each one

1514
01:18:25,478 --> 01:18:26,798
When I killed him...

1515
01:18:27,190 --> 01:18:29,070
There is no fear of his eyes

1516
01:18:29,702 --> 01:18:30,862
He is so bright

1517
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:08,270
Dad, can you do me a favor?

1518
01:19:08,295 --> 01:19:09,135
Tell me son...

1519
01:19:09,432 --> 01:19:11,032
There's so much happening around me...

1520
01:19:11,182 --> 01:19:12,822
I need time to introspect.

1521
01:19:13,271 --> 01:19:16,951
I want you to manage the
household for a month

1522
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:18,255
So...

1523
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,287
Tell me...

1524
01:19:20,762 --> 01:19:22,882
Can you work for a month instead?

1525
01:19:23,804 --> 01:19:25,484
I don't have a choice.

1526
01:19:26,772 --> 01:19:29,212
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

1527
01:19:30,148 --> 01:19:31,771
- Kasthuri Madam...
- Who's it?

1528
01:19:31,796 --> 01:19:34,356
It's me, Bhagya's friend, Arivu.

1529
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:37,199
Why are you here? Please leave.

1530
01:19:37,374 --> 01:19:41,854
There's a link between my friend's
murder and you

1531
01:19:41,886 --> 01:19:43,686
I won't leave until I find it!

1532
01:19:44,896 --> 01:19:47,176
Will you open the door or
should I break in?

1533
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:53,802
My son loves your food products,
can you deliver them home?

1534
01:19:53,827 --> 01:19:55,307
Sure, which locality?

1535
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:56,812
St.Thomas mount

1536
01:19:57,109 --> 01:19:58,685
Siddhu, why're you doing this?

1537
01:19:58,775 --> 01:20:00,335
- Madam
- Play inside...

1538
01:20:01,022 --> 01:20:03,702
Come in Bhagya, you're very punctual!

1539
01:20:03,773 --> 01:20:06,213
Hi Bhagya, how are you?

1540
01:20:07,653 --> 01:20:08,493
Madam...

1541
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:14,974
Madam...

1542
01:20:15,329 --> 01:20:16,609
Yes Bhagya.

1543
01:20:16,634 --> 01:20:20,154
I'm with my son, leave it outside...
I'll take it later

1544
01:20:20,501 --> 01:20:22,421
Money is under the flower vase.

1545
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:38,294
Madam...

1546
01:20:41,965 --> 01:20:45,169
Why did you pretend buying this
for your dead son?

1547
01:20:45,194 --> 01:20:47,279
There are cameras everywhere...
and what's with you?

1548
01:20:47,304 --> 01:20:48,584
What's happening here?

1549
01:20:49,392 --> 01:20:51,192
Either tell me or I'll make this public.

1550
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,008
My husband died in a road accident;

1551
01:20:56,015 --> 01:21:00,775
My son Siddhu, was the only
reason for me to live!

1552
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:05,398
My life slowly transformed
because of him.

1553
01:21:06,086 --> 01:21:09,526
But even that didn't last long!

1554
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:14,672
He became ill...

1555
01:21:17,303 --> 01:21:19,263
I thought it was just fever.

1556
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:23,230
They took a CT scan

1557
01:21:30,095 --> 01:21:32,615
And gave me the biggest shock
of my life!

1558
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:35,610
saying it was cancer.

1559
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:41,250
Mom!

1560
01:21:47,655 --> 01:21:50,255
No matter how much we tried...

1561
01:21:51,262 --> 01:21:52,822
it was all futile.

1562
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:57,599
I couldn't digest this at all.

1563
01:21:58,333 --> 01:22:03,293
Doctors told me junk food
could be a probable cause;

1564
01:22:03,738 --> 01:22:05,578
I wanted to know about it in detail.

1565
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:12,665
Junk foods aren't manufactured
the way they are advertised;

1566
01:22:12,854 --> 01:22:17,054
Our daily food like
noodles, bread, cake...

1567
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:21,159
are manufactured
using toxic chemicals.

1568
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:25,544
Kids don't ask for these repeatedly...

1569
01:22:25,576 --> 01:22:28,096
just because it tastes good.

1570
01:22:28,435 --> 01:22:31,646
The taste is enhanced through visuals,

1571
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:35,141
by listening to their favorite stars'
endorsements

1572
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:36,779
and by free merchandizes.

1573
01:22:36,804 --> 01:22:41,084
They're addicted to it due to
the dopamine rush

1574
01:22:41,109 --> 01:22:43,904
...it creates in their brains!

1575
01:22:44,063 --> 01:22:46,943
No matter whichever product you take,

1576
01:22:46,968 --> 01:22:54,288
they deny adding preservatives
or additives.

1577
01:22:54,495 --> 01:22:56,215
Do kids eat just bread ?

1578
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:58,333
they eat jam, noodles...

1579
01:22:58,358 --> 01:23:00,838
biscuits, juice...

1580
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,960
each of which has a variety
of chemicals.

1581
01:23:03,094 --> 01:23:07,950
The cocktail of these chemicals...

1582
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:09,696
turns toxic inside our body!

1583
01:23:09,721 --> 01:23:14,761
All over world Chennai is 2nd
place for child cancer

1584
01:23:15,446 --> 01:23:18,474
It's said, our generation
will be the cursed ones

1585
01:23:18,499 --> 01:23:21,819
to see the deaths of our kids.

1586
01:23:24,695 --> 01:23:26,415
To avenge my loss...

1587
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,160
I filed a lawsuit on Saffron company.

1588
01:23:29,348 --> 01:23:32,308
what's the proof to say our products
caused him cancer?

1589
01:23:32,513 --> 01:23:34,130
He could have eaten other things...

1590
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:36,650
or even contaminated water.

1591
01:23:36,675 --> 01:23:39,235
Or your synthetic outfit could also
have been a cause

1592
01:23:39,499 --> 01:23:45,899
The case was dismissed due to
insufficient evidence!

1593
01:23:46,653 --> 01:23:47,813
That's when I decided...

1594
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:50,485
to sacrifice myself for the evidence.

1595
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:53,629
I'm consuming the same poison,

1596
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,969
that my son died of!

1597
01:23:57,127 --> 01:23:58,847
to prove the entire world!

1598
01:23:59,195 --> 01:24:01,835
To track the change in blood cells...

1599
01:24:02,214 --> 01:24:04,334
it takes approximately 4 months.

1600
01:24:04,487 --> 01:24:06,847
So my battle will last 4 months.

1601
01:24:07,031 --> 01:24:10,391
or maybe till my body gives in.

1602
01:24:10,582 --> 01:24:14,462
Surveillance camera will monitor me 24*7

1603
01:24:14,622 --> 01:24:17,862
And I've got a guy to deliver
the Saffron goods.

1604
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:19,270
Today is the first day.

1605
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:27,730
Is your kid asleep madam?

1606
01:24:52,828 --> 01:24:54,348
Today is the first day

1607
01:24:57,432 --> 01:25:01,752
I'm gonna take bath,
there are no eatables here

1608
01:25:01,925 --> 01:25:03,765
but still to avoid doubts...

1609
01:25:07,729 --> 01:25:09,569
Will this evidence suffice?

1610
01:25:09,735 --> 01:25:13,015
I've seen murders without flinching,

1611
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:17,119
but it's depressing to see
such a suicide!

1612
01:25:17,358 --> 01:25:20,918
My heart's heavy,
please tell me what to do?

1613
01:25:29,342 --> 01:25:32,822
I can't believe he is dead!

1614
01:25:35,398 --> 01:25:36,838
What a sick society this is!

1615
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:42,561
You make mothers kill
their own children.

1616
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:49,450
I fed him these cookies myself!

1617
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,864
I'm vigilant about what my child eats

1618
01:25:53,365 --> 01:25:55,005
but if reputed companies tamper
our food,

1619
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,710
should we be paranoid about eating too?

1620
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:59,775
I won't spare Saffron company!

1621
01:26:00,696 --> 01:26:04,696
I understand, I'm at a loss for words;

1622
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:08,550
but today is the last day
you'll be eating this.

1623
01:26:08,575 --> 01:26:10,615
I won't let you do this to yourself.

1624
01:26:10,901 --> 01:26:13,061
I'll come back with a solution.

1625
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:17,832
I met Kasthuri to enquire
about Bhagya's death.

1626
01:26:17,974 --> 01:26:19,174
What are you saying?

1627
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,119
Didn't I tell you to update me
on everything?

1628
01:26:21,254 --> 01:26:22,214
I know sir.

1629
01:26:22,638 --> 01:26:26,158
Our company's products were the
reason for her child's death!

1630
01:26:26,567 --> 01:26:28,287
To prove that...

1631
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:30,910
she's consuming only our products.

1632
01:26:31,116 --> 01:26:33,156
She has a visual record of it.

1633
01:26:33,242 --> 01:26:35,162
Jeyram you can't escape this time!

1634
01:26:35,187 --> 01:26:37,547
I won't leave you and your company

1635
01:26:38,284 --> 01:26:42,004
I guess her vital organs have failed;

1636
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:43,779
anything can happen to her now.

1637
01:26:43,804 --> 01:26:45,964
I feel bad hearing this.

1638
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:51,558
I regret working in such
an unscrupulous place!

1639
01:26:51,726 --> 01:26:54,326
We need to help Kasthuri, at any cost!

1640
01:26:54,606 --> 01:26:56,646
We'll drag our company to court.

1641
01:26:56,859 --> 01:26:58,619
This is what she says too!

1642
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:01,207
But I feel something beyond this...

1643
01:27:01,318 --> 01:27:03,358
I came to tell you about it.

1644
01:27:04,878 --> 01:27:05,716
- What?
- Sir

1645
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:08,466
I felt offended when someone
called me a hit man;

1646
01:27:08,491 --> 01:27:09,974
I'm sure our workers will also feel
offended...

1647
01:27:09,999 --> 01:27:11,599
knowing what happened to Kasthuri.

1648
01:27:11,624 --> 01:27:15,624
Similarly... every worker will rebel
against their corrupt organization!

1649
01:27:16,095 --> 01:27:19,855
Us workers, who carry out
their evil deeds...

1650
01:27:20,957 --> 01:27:23,117
can change things if we change!

1651
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:24,247
Are you mad?

1652
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:26,287
Everyone's busy with their own work,

1653
01:27:26,382 --> 01:27:29,702
The guy who knows about
the scams won't bother...

1654
01:27:29,805 --> 01:27:31,085
or deny it!

1655
01:27:31,421 --> 01:27:33,861
And the guy who doesn't know...
will be shocked!

1656
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:36,037
but won't have a solution.

1657
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:38,278
It's a foolish and impossible move

1658
01:27:38,303 --> 01:27:40,383
to reach out to fellow workers.

1659
01:27:42,038 --> 01:27:44,118
We had a similar discussion before;

1660
01:27:44,374 --> 01:27:45,774
when you asked me...

1661
01:27:45,846 --> 01:27:48,486
if a large scale road block campaign
was possible?

1662
01:27:48,511 --> 01:27:49,671
I told you it was impossible.

1663
01:27:49,834 --> 01:27:52,394
you looked at me menially and said...

1664
01:27:52,419 --> 01:27:55,459
there's nothing impossible in marketing!

1665
01:27:55,996 --> 01:27:58,116
If we can reach a product
through marketing;

1666
01:27:58,265 --> 01:27:59,950
why can't we reach our pain as well?

1667
01:27:59,975 --> 01:28:01,575
Stop blabbering mindlessly...

1668
01:28:01,884 --> 01:28:03,004
Is this even an idea?

1669
01:28:03,029 --> 01:28:05,469
Don't share this with anyone,
They will think you've gone mad.

1670
01:28:05,494 --> 01:28:07,854
I feel ashamed to have trained you!

1671
01:28:08,165 --> 01:28:10,525
Get me those videos from
Kasthuri tomorrow.

1672
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:12,755
End of discussion...Get out!

1673
01:28:18,509 --> 01:28:21,069
Something interesting happened today...

1674
01:28:21,975 --> 01:28:23,415
A lower middle class guy...

1675
01:28:23,599 --> 01:28:25,639
came up to me and asked me...

1676
01:28:26,016 --> 01:28:30,736
why can't we take the consumer's
problems to workers?

1677
01:28:32,637 --> 01:28:34,117
I was shocked!

1678
01:28:35,056 --> 01:28:43,376
His approach completely baffled me.

1679
01:28:43,661 --> 01:28:49,261
It's a waste talking to
these criminal bosses;

1680
01:28:49,495 --> 01:28:54,335
Similarly we can't force a consumer
to stop buying goods.

1681
01:28:54,695 --> 01:28:59,255
It's only the skivvy like me,
we have to target

1682
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:01,070
we have to change them...

1683
01:29:01,274 --> 01:29:04,114
It's the only solution for our problems.

1684
01:29:04,326 --> 01:29:05,206
Why would they change?

1685
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:07,411
He is doing his work
to support his life.

1686
01:29:07,503 --> 01:29:09,543
You guys don't seem to understand!

1687
01:29:09,568 --> 01:29:15,648
The workers and consumers are
the very same people!

1688
01:29:15,673 --> 01:29:17,113
I don't get it.

1689
01:29:17,737 --> 01:29:19,697
They are workers only for 8 hours,

1690
01:29:20,035 --> 01:29:23,195
the rest of the time,
they are consumers.

1691
01:29:23,469 --> 01:29:26,669
He's living in the society,
he's ruining!

1692
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:28,701
If we could get this point across...

1693
01:29:29,127 --> 01:29:30,068
everything will change.

1694
01:29:30,093 --> 01:29:31,493
This is impossible!

1695
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:32,616
Don't blabber!

1696
01:29:33,004 --> 01:29:34,844
Ya right, I can't!

1697
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:37,904
It's not viable to be a good person,
It's not possible do any good.

1698
01:29:37,929 --> 01:29:38,889
You're right!

1699
01:29:39,069 --> 01:29:43,429
But Adhi told me there's
nothing impossible in marketing!

1700
01:29:43,783 --> 01:29:46,023
He's ingrained it in my mind.

1701
01:29:46,329 --> 01:29:48,889
Even if my mentor disapproves,
or if Kasthuri desists

1702
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:50,928
I'll still find a solution.

1703
01:29:51,435 --> 01:29:53,595
Let's think over it in the morning.

1704
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:54,460
Let's go!

1705
01:29:58,671 --> 01:30:00,911
We have thought about it so many times

1706
01:30:00,936 --> 01:30:03,776
Nobody is gonna be affected,
whether or not you get a solution!

1707
01:30:03,801 --> 01:30:06,481
Don't drag Kasthuri in to this,
without any clarity.

1708
01:30:06,559 --> 01:30:07,519
Atleast if you let her be,

1709
01:30:07,544 --> 01:30:09,304
her own battle will give her
some satisfaction.

1710
01:30:09,415 --> 01:30:12,655
You can't turn workers
against their bosses;

1711
01:30:13,046 --> 01:30:14,802
What have you been studying
for the last two centuries?

1712
01:30:14,936 --> 01:30:16,456
Macaulay Education system...

1713
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:20,191
invented by the Brits to raise
a generation of puppets.

1714
01:30:20,216 --> 01:30:24,736
These workers belong in the same class
as those puppets!

1715
01:30:24,823 --> 01:30:26,115
Do you think you can change them?

1716
01:30:26,217 --> 01:30:27,297
No way in hell.

1717
01:30:27,431 --> 01:30:29,311
Don't waste your time and energy!

1718
01:30:29,336 --> 01:30:31,296
Why did they call me to this meeting?

1719
01:30:31,367 --> 01:30:34,007
He spoke well, but I
understood nothing.

1720
01:30:36,046 --> 01:30:38,686
Are you gonna tell the workers
not to work?

1721
01:30:38,711 --> 01:30:41,551
Will they stop working, if you say so?

1722
01:30:41,654 --> 01:30:44,094
It's futile trying to explain this
to workers.

1723
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:47,799
Don't kill her with your silly theories
and experiments!

1724
01:30:52,207 --> 01:30:53,047
Arivu...

1725
01:30:53,815 --> 01:30:54,615
What mom?

1726
01:30:54,919 --> 01:30:57,399
Why are you mumbling to yourself?

1727
01:30:58,528 --> 01:31:01,168
You won't understand why!

1728
01:31:09,038 --> 01:31:11,758
I was hearing you guys speak;

1729
01:31:13,015 --> 01:31:15,455
and would like to suggest something.

1730
01:31:18,173 --> 01:31:20,733
Not sure if I can tell you...

1731
01:31:21,102 --> 01:31:22,342
but let me try.

1732
01:31:24,167 --> 01:31:27,407
I've been working as a maid for 30 years

1733
01:31:27,943 --> 01:31:29,863
atleast in 20 different houses.

1734
01:31:30,134 --> 01:31:34,934
A few men would stare at me perversely.

1735
01:31:36,367 --> 01:31:43,767
I felt disgusted that my own bosses
were doing this.

1736
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:47,959
But I accepted it as my fate.

1737
01:31:48,445 --> 01:31:53,125
But one of them tried to
touch me inappropriately;

1738
01:31:53,719 --> 01:31:55,919
I was shocked!

1739
01:31:56,174 --> 01:31:57,454
That's when I realized...

1740
01:31:57,830 --> 01:32:00,830
I need to be loyal to my work,

1741
01:32:00,863 --> 01:32:03,543
not to my boss!

1742
01:32:03,702 --> 01:32:07,142
I gave him an intense frown;

1743
01:32:07,479 --> 01:32:10,759
and he got scared!

1744
01:32:12,654 --> 01:32:14,374
He was petrified,

1745
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:16,639
He didn't fire me.

1746
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:21,400
instead he got scared if I would
disclose this to others

1747
01:32:21,596 --> 01:32:23,435
He deliberately stayed away from me

1748
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,500
and couldn't face me.

1749
01:32:26,564 --> 01:32:30,844
Infact, he treated me with more respect!

1750
01:32:34,133 --> 01:32:35,853
Do you know why I'm saying this?

1751
01:32:37,287 --> 01:32:42,047
We need to set our own boundaries
for our loyalty.

1752
01:32:42,862 --> 01:32:44,902
Nobody else has that power...

1753
01:32:44,927 --> 01:32:47,087
not even our boss!

1754
01:32:48,621 --> 01:32:51,701
Our salary is for the work we do...

1755
01:32:51,806 --> 01:32:55,366
It's not a bribe to
conceal their mistakes.

1756
01:32:56,807 --> 01:32:59,407
I shared what I felt.

1757
01:33:02,023 --> 01:33:03,023
Mom...

1758
01:33:03,557 --> 01:33:04,318
What?

1759
01:33:04,343 --> 01:33:07,503
- Mom...
- What?

1760
01:33:07,672 --> 01:33:09,592
Where did you hide such wisdom so long?

1761
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:11,697
You have told me such a
powerful thing today!

1762
01:33:11,775 --> 01:33:13,895
I've understood it now.

1763
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:17,610
Eureka!

1764
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:23,771
I'm so happy.

1765
01:33:23,796 --> 01:33:25,236
My mom gave me all the answers.

1766
01:33:25,261 --> 01:33:27,341
She made me understand
the power of a worker.

1767
01:33:27,592 --> 01:33:28,712
Do you know what it is?

1768
01:33:28,975 --> 01:33:30,135
Loyalty!

1769
01:33:30,328 --> 01:33:31,568
Loyalty!

1770
01:33:31,895 --> 01:33:33,335
If we break that...

1771
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:34,760
no matter how big they are

1772
01:33:34,785 --> 01:33:36,465
it's easy to defeat them!

1773
01:33:36,847 --> 01:33:39,887
It doesn't require a revolution,

1774
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:42,832
an opposition is more than enough...

1775
01:33:42,857 --> 01:33:44,657
to defeat them.

1776
01:33:45,311 --> 01:33:49,591
If we can popularize a
formulated drink worldwide;

1777
01:33:49,813 --> 01:33:54,333
we can also reach my
formulated ideas worldwide!

1778
01:33:54,415 --> 01:33:56,735
I have a plan ready.

1779
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:57,960
I'm gonna put it in action.

1780
01:33:57,985 --> 01:34:00,185
I'll start with my own company.

1781
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:02,570
Setting an example through that...

1782
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,755
I'll do much more!

1783
01:34:05,237 --> 01:34:09,237
Only you seem to understand
my pain and struggles.

1784
01:34:10,081 --> 01:34:11,801
Just tell me I'm right...

1785
01:34:11,826 --> 01:34:14,306
I won't utter a word about Kasthuri,
even to my mentor.

1786
01:34:14,407 --> 01:34:16,127
Your word is enough!

1787
01:34:17,687 --> 01:34:21,087
Just be with me...
I'll achieve anything!

1788
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:22,429
Will you?

1789
01:34:31,685 --> 01:34:37,420
"Oh my life, my love"

1790
01:34:37,445 --> 01:34:44,045
"Leaving you is the same as dying"

1791
01:34:44,839 --> 01:34:50,399
"Oh dusk, Oh my dawn!"

1792
01:34:50,596 --> 01:34:53,716
"My days henceforth,"

1793
01:34:53,850 --> 01:34:57,890
"will be on your gaze!"

1794
01:34:58,022 --> 01:35:01,217
"Untouched by farewell's gloom"

1795
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:04,358
"You were my consort, my love!"

1796
01:35:04,546 --> 01:35:07,626
"Impervious to mien"

1797
01:35:07,861 --> 01:35:10,982
"I'll seek solace in your heart!"

1798
01:35:11,007 --> 01:35:14,207
"Till eternity our love lasts"

1799
01:35:14,473 --> 01:35:17,513
"Without it, I'm just a corpse!"

1800
01:35:17,733 --> 01:35:21,013
"'ME' isn't just me"

1801
01:35:21,038 --> 01:35:24,358
"It's you my love, run towards me!"

1802
01:35:24,383 --> 01:35:27,623
"Till eternity our love lasts"

1803
01:35:27,648 --> 01:35:30,888
"Without it, I'm just a corpse!"

1804
01:35:30,913 --> 01:35:34,185
"'ME' isn't just me"

1805
01:35:34,210 --> 01:35:37,490
"It's you my love, run towards me!"

1806
01:35:41,342 --> 01:35:44,462
"We'll meet hurdles"

1807
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:47,943
"We may even get weary"

1808
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:54,513
"And face the depths of pain, my love"

1809
01:35:54,538 --> 01:36:00,578
"You're the prison I wanna be
caged in!"

1810
01:36:01,105 --> 01:36:06,615
"I'm the fondling feather
you'll cherish!"

1811
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:10,280
"There's no permanence;"

1812
01:36:10,305 --> 01:36:13,665
"Today's just an illusion"

1813
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:16,890
"We'll rage till we die"

1814
01:36:16,915 --> 01:36:20,075
"and chill on a volcano!"

1815
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:23,340
"Till eternity, our love lasts"

1816
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:26,889
"Without it, I'm just a corpse"

1817
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:30,074
"'ME' isn't just me"

1818
01:36:30,099 --> 01:36:33,459
"It's you my love, run towards me!"

1819
01:36:35,753 --> 01:36:37,913
Did I ask you for your help?

1820
01:36:38,608 --> 01:36:40,608
Just let me follow my own path!

1821
01:36:40,663 --> 01:36:45,623
He's trying to make your struggle
more meaningful.

1822
01:36:45,743 --> 01:36:46,903
Definitely he will win

1823
01:36:48,334 --> 01:36:49,974
We are here for you.

1824
01:36:54,869 --> 01:36:57,269
I'm going to meet Saffron's
investors tomorrow.

1825
01:36:58,182 --> 01:36:59,062
It's a big move dad.

1826
01:37:00,085 --> 01:37:02,845
Loknath, enough of being Jeyram's spy,

1827
01:37:02,893 --> 01:37:06,326
you're gonna be my spy tomorrow
at the investors' meeting.

1828
01:37:06,433 --> 01:37:08,396
Family day celebrations are
held tomorrow

1829
01:37:08,427 --> 01:37:09,867
We should seize this opportunity...

1830
01:37:09,953 --> 01:37:12,073
and do some sample marketing!

1831
01:37:17,071 --> 01:37:19,646
The first step in bringing the workers
to our side is;

1832
01:37:19,671 --> 01:37:21,951
to amass the support of
all 5 department heads.

1833
01:37:23,759 --> 01:37:25,959
A product would be essential
only for a few people;

1834
01:37:26,171 --> 01:37:28,068
but the company will force us
to sell it to everyone!

1835
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:29,973
yet we have done it.

1836
01:37:30,176 --> 01:37:33,456
The first few people will
automatically buy it;

1837
01:37:33,589 --> 01:37:36,869
but the rest has to be persuaded
to buy it.

1838
01:37:36,894 --> 01:37:39,614
The real challenge are the
rest of the few

1839
01:37:39,732 --> 01:37:41,185
They won't buy it no matter
what you say...

1840
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:42,730
We'll deal with them emotionally

1841
01:37:42,949 --> 01:37:45,123
by exploiting their sympathy towards us.

1842
01:37:45,148 --> 01:37:46,935
and win them over with sentiments.

1843
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:47,960
He'll buy only then.

1844
01:37:47,985 --> 01:37:49,705
We will apply the same tactic here too.

1845
01:37:49,955 --> 01:37:53,155
We will convince them this way.

1846
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:56,100
No matter what you do,
It's impossible to please everybody.

1847
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,805
Atleast 5% of them will revolt.

1848
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:00,430
They can neither be convinced
nor shunned.

1849
01:38:01,254 --> 01:38:03,934
Okay guys, we'll make a
new start tomorrow!

1850
01:38:03,959 --> 01:38:07,896
"All hardworking friends, gather here"

1851
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:11,241
"Sing along, the world is ours"

1852
01:38:11,405 --> 01:38:15,365
"For a society without disparities"

1853
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,576
"come up with a solution"

1854
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:24,641
"Let's follow the path
of Arignar Anna"

1855
01:38:24,863 --> 01:38:26,783
Bro, super
Thanks

1856
01:38:27,767 --> 01:38:30,247
I welcome everyone present here...

1857
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,712
to the grand celebration...
on the occasion of,

1858
01:38:32,737 --> 01:38:34,657
The Family day function of Saffron!

1859
01:38:34,863 --> 01:38:36,684
Before we could start...

1860
01:38:36,709 --> 01:38:41,506
I would like to thank our
encouraging team heads

1861
01:38:41,531 --> 01:38:45,724
for permitting us to conduct this event
on a grand scale!

1862
01:38:45,749 --> 01:38:47,229
Thank you so much!

1863
01:38:48,269 --> 01:38:52,669
I want to show you how people
at Saffron work,

1864
01:38:52,694 --> 01:38:54,974
through an AV.

1865
01:38:54,999 --> 01:38:56,879
Let's have a look.

1866
01:39:12,064 --> 01:39:14,704
The reason Saffron is number one;

1867
01:39:14,931 --> 01:39:17,731
is because of your hard work!

1868
01:39:17,756 --> 01:39:19,956
So all of you repeat after me,
with confidence...

1869
01:39:19,981 --> 01:39:22,301
We're the best!

1870
01:39:25,736 --> 01:39:27,016
What's going on?

1871
01:39:27,181 --> 01:39:28,221
why are you here?

1872
01:39:28,246 --> 01:39:30,646
while I've made arrangements
for our meeting elsewhere!

1873
01:39:33,653 --> 01:39:34,653
Excuse me sir...

1874
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:37,133
- Adhi?
- No...

1875
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:39,440
Adhiban...

1876
01:39:40,295 --> 01:39:43,615
Adhiban Madhav, New Fedora
MD's only son

1877
01:39:44,013 --> 01:39:47,333
You planted a spy in my company...
to depose us.

1878
01:39:49,206 --> 01:39:53,166
But I became a spy to buy your company!

1879
01:39:53,717 --> 01:39:56,837
It's entire administration is
under my control now!

1880
01:39:56,948 --> 01:39:58,388
including your investors.

1881
01:39:58,413 --> 01:40:00,973
Some of the highlights
of my damages were...

1882
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:04,110
was to get you fettered in
to the milk product.

1883
01:40:04,683 --> 01:40:06,724
- I think we should do this
- Thank you sir.

1884
01:40:06,749 --> 01:40:09,909
I have the license and patent for it;

1885
01:40:10,023 --> 01:40:11,863
Making an ad was our only expenditure.

1886
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:14,502
You won't get even a single penny...

1887
01:40:14,534 --> 01:40:16,254
of the 800 million you have
invested in it.

1888
01:40:17,054 --> 01:40:17,974
So Jeyram,

1889
01:40:18,062 --> 01:40:25,662
you will never be able to beat
the mess you're in right now!

1890
01:40:26,309 --> 01:40:27,949
I will avenge this!

1891
01:40:30,854 --> 01:40:34,574
Jeyram, the best thing you can
do now is join hands with them.

1892
01:40:35,055 --> 01:40:37,975
Family & kids can help yourself to
the buffet outside.

1893
01:40:38,015 --> 01:40:39,055
You can spend some time there.

1894
01:40:39,166 --> 01:40:41,166
Our plan is working out buddy.

1895
01:40:41,276 --> 01:40:43,596
Get the next act ready,
I'll be back after a quick call.

1896
01:40:44,016 --> 01:40:46,616
Let's see you smile, as you sign...

1897
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:49,160
I'll take care of it good than you

1898
01:40:55,351 --> 01:40:56,431
- Arivu
- Sir

1899
01:40:56,615 --> 01:40:58,775
Can you come to our auditorium?

1900
01:40:58,885 --> 01:40:59,765
What's the matter?

1901
01:40:59,847 --> 01:41:02,247
- It's regarding Kasthuri...
- Did you get the evidence?

1902
01:41:02,638 --> 01:41:03,398
Yes...

1903
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:06,497
I wanna talk about it to you in person.

1904
01:41:06,522 --> 01:41:07,322
Be right there!

1905
01:41:07,383 --> 01:41:09,023
Dad, good sign!

1906
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,200
See you gentlemen.

1907
01:41:10,462 --> 01:41:12,302
We all saw how proud your family was;

1908
01:41:12,327 --> 01:41:14,727
to see a glimpse of your hard work!

1909
01:41:14,934 --> 01:41:18,694
Can we now see how it affects others?

1910
01:41:22,006 --> 01:41:24,526
Sir, please play it.

1911
01:41:27,839 --> 01:41:30,159
My son died of cancer...

1912
01:41:30,184 --> 01:41:31,464
caused by Saffron products.

1913
01:41:31,553 --> 01:41:35,353
Everybody around me and even courts...
didn't believe it.

1914
01:41:35,526 --> 01:41:37,310
Hence to prove it...
I'm doing this to myself.

1915
01:41:37,335 --> 01:41:39,575
- Sir, isn't it pathetic?
- Yes Arivu.

1916
01:41:40,294 --> 01:41:41,654
Just this video is enough,

1917
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,159
to shut this company down.

1918
01:41:43,826 --> 01:41:46,226
If you're feeling this sad;

1919
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:48,350
won't they too?

1920
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,487
- For who?
- Our workers.

1921
01:41:51,749 --> 01:41:52,443
What?

1922
01:41:52,468 --> 01:41:54,628
They are watching it, as we speak

1923
01:41:54,864 --> 01:41:56,304
Come with me.

1924
01:41:57,926 --> 01:41:59,406
Watch out, there's nobody here.

1925
01:41:59,431 --> 01:42:02,671
I couldn't live a life with my son...

1926
01:42:03,006 --> 01:42:06,286
I want justice for his death!

1927
01:42:06,311 --> 01:42:07,911
I'll die peacefully.

1928
01:42:09,888 --> 01:42:12,368
They won the case by arguing that...

1929
01:42:12,456 --> 01:42:15,856
there may or may not be harmful
chemicals in these products.

1930
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:18,460
Here's the solid proof!

1931
01:42:19,474 --> 01:42:22,175
I'm consuming the same poison,

1932
01:42:22,740 --> 01:42:25,460
that my son died of!

1933
01:42:25,485 --> 01:42:27,365
to prove the entire world!

1934
01:42:28,464 --> 01:42:29,904
Just read what's written here;

1935
01:42:30,271 --> 01:42:32,471
at least for our sake.

1936
01:42:34,133 --> 01:42:38,213
A boss may not understand my loss;

1937
01:42:38,462 --> 01:42:42,622
nor will a consumer...

1938
01:42:43,062 --> 01:42:50,022
but I sincerely believe,
that a worker will!

1939
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:53,810
They should!

1940
01:42:57,655 --> 01:42:58,855
Did you see that?

1941
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:01,744
you told me this was impossible;

1942
01:43:02,172 --> 01:43:04,532
but I will get my point across
to these people.

1943
01:43:05,096 --> 01:43:07,136
I hid this from you;

1944
01:43:07,231 --> 01:43:08,671
so that you could see it for yourself!

1945
01:43:08,696 --> 01:43:09,696
Sorry sir.

1946
01:43:16,316 --> 01:43:18,516
Can you still say "We're the best?"

1947
01:43:22,852 --> 01:43:25,732
Do you have the virtue to say that?

1948
01:43:26,327 --> 01:43:28,767
They have stripped us of all virtues!
That's the fact.

1949
01:43:29,246 --> 01:43:32,526
We just saw... your
family's applause for you.

1950
01:43:32,551 --> 01:43:33,871
Can you be truthful in telling...

1951
01:43:33,896 --> 01:43:35,936
that you are proud to do
this sort of work?

1952
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:38,695
The truth is, we're all good people

1953
01:43:39,015 --> 01:43:42,920
in front of our family and the society.

1954
01:43:43,011 --> 01:43:44,291
But when it comes to work;

1955
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:48,010
we mindlessly follow our bosses
without realizing the consequences.

1956
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:51,770
Should our hardwork be misused;
to kill the innocent consumers?

1957
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:57,445
We are all prime reasons
for their losses!

1958
01:43:57,470 --> 01:43:59,470
Are you implying we're wrong?

1959
01:43:59,597 --> 01:44:01,617
of course, each one of us is guilty!

1960
01:44:01,642 --> 01:44:05,122
They extract work from us
through division of labor.

1961
01:44:05,262 --> 01:44:06,782
Our very own Moorthy...

1962
01:44:06,846 --> 01:44:08,286
claims he's in charge of
only the bottle caps

1963
01:44:08,311 --> 01:44:10,664
Ravi says he made only these bottles

1964
01:44:10,689 --> 01:44:13,409
Moses says he operated
only these machines.

1965
01:44:13,535 --> 01:44:15,415
but what you don't understand is...

1966
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,320
that it's a cumulative work of everyone.

1967
01:44:17,391 --> 01:44:21,391
When will we ever understand
the larger picture?

1968
01:44:21,695 --> 01:44:25,015
It's not division of labor,
it's division of crime.

1969
01:44:26,843 --> 01:44:28,062
Look at what he has done!

1970
01:44:28,087 --> 01:44:30,367
He has sent this video to my wife.

1971
01:44:30,469 --> 01:44:31,869
How dare he?

1972
01:44:32,308 --> 01:44:33,719
Why did you send this my family?

1973
01:44:33,744 --> 01:44:34,744
Don't you have any sense?

1974
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:37,769
What will our family think of us,
seeing such videos?

1975
01:44:37,794 --> 01:44:40,954
Was insulting us your plan all along?

1976
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:42,110
I'll teach you a lesson

1977
01:44:42,135 --> 01:44:45,094
It wasn't Kasthuri's video,
it was a corporate video.

1978
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:46,999
Why can't you see properly?

1979
01:44:49,032 --> 01:44:50,512
Why did you have to hit him?

1980
01:44:50,537 --> 01:44:52,156
- No, I didn't.
- You almost killed him.

1981
01:44:52,181 --> 01:44:53,581
- It's okay bro
- But, you're bleeding.

1982
01:44:53,848 --> 01:44:56,368
Let's assume you didn't hit me...

1983
01:44:56,575 --> 01:44:58,415
But I actually didn't!

1984
01:44:58,633 --> 01:44:59,953
This is the least of my agony.

1985
01:45:00,063 --> 01:45:01,943
you haven't understood my point yet...

1986
01:45:02,109 --> 01:45:03,211
that's what agonizes me.

1987
01:45:03,303 --> 01:45:06,703
Weren't you terrified now, assuming
your family has seen the video?

1988
01:45:06,907 --> 01:45:08,707
That's exactly,
what's wrong with our work.

1989
01:45:09,093 --> 01:45:11,453
Weren't you relieved when you knew
they didn't see it;

1990
01:45:11,478 --> 01:45:13,038
weren't you?

1991
01:45:13,063 --> 01:45:14,823
That's what we have to do now!

1992
01:45:15,262 --> 01:45:17,142
If we're unable to talk about our jobs

1993
01:45:17,167 --> 01:45:18,247
to our family...

1994
01:45:18,349 --> 01:45:19,492
it means we are in the wrong job.

1995
01:45:19,517 --> 01:45:21,197
We shouldn't do it anymore.

1996
01:45:21,606 --> 01:45:24,211
We're closer to the consumers
than our bosses.

1997
01:45:24,236 --> 01:45:27,636
If you wanna be loyal to our bosses
then our real bosses are the consumers.

1998
01:45:27,854 --> 01:45:29,374
So let's be loyal to them.

1999
01:45:29,807 --> 01:45:31,727
What do you propose we do?

2000
01:45:31,752 --> 01:45:32,832
You tell me.

2001
01:45:32,983 --> 01:45:35,463
Do you want us to conduct
a labor strike?

2002
01:45:35,583 --> 01:45:38,463
File a complaint?
or sue the company?

2003
01:45:38,824 --> 01:45:40,562
Or parade around in protest?

2004
01:45:40,587 --> 01:45:41,987
Is that all?

2005
01:45:42,742 --> 01:45:45,502
We needn't do such filmy things.
There's a simple solution.

2006
01:45:45,527 --> 01:45:46,847
What's it?

2007
01:45:50,213 --> 01:45:52,133
For just 2 days...

2008
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,260
let's follow the government regulations.

2009
01:45:54,391 --> 01:45:55,911
without the boss' knowledge!

2010
01:45:56,570 --> 01:45:58,703
- How can we do that?
- Why not?

2011
01:45:58,728 --> 01:46:02,848
Haven't you theorized
false reports before?

2012
01:46:02,979 --> 01:46:05,179
During last month's inspection

2013
01:46:05,290 --> 01:46:07,250
you followed these rules,
to save our boss!

2014
01:46:07,275 --> 01:46:09,955
You're right, but it's risky!

2015
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:11,484
None of you will be affected.

2016
01:46:11,524 --> 01:46:14,764
even if there's a problem...few of
my boys have joined the company.

2017
01:46:14,822 --> 01:46:16,622
They will take the blame!

2018
01:46:16,918 --> 01:46:18,438
- Won't you, guys?
- Of course!

2019
01:46:18,541 --> 01:46:20,000
We have done this before
for immoral things;

2020
01:46:20,025 --> 01:46:22,625
why wouldn't we do it
for a higher purpose?

2021
01:46:23,237 --> 01:46:26,637
From what you imply...it looks like you
want us to revolt against our boss!

2022
01:46:26,662 --> 01:46:29,822
and sit at home forsaking our jobs?

2023
01:46:29,949 --> 01:46:32,109
We'll all be on roads,
if we listen to him.

2024
01:46:32,134 --> 01:46:33,453
That's exactly what I'm saying.

2025
01:46:33,478 --> 01:46:36,438
They have promoted me by merit;

2026
01:46:36,727 --> 01:46:38,887
I won't let this happen.

2027
01:46:38,912 --> 01:46:41,992
Do you think you will have
these jobs, anyway?

2028
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:43,870
My friend Bhagya;

2029
01:46:43,998 --> 01:46:45,798
was killed because of Saffron.

2030
01:46:46,134 --> 01:46:47,894
I'll sue this company!

2031
01:46:48,335 --> 01:46:50,375
and it will be shut down
for at least 2 months.

2032
01:46:50,671 --> 01:46:54,271
If not me, Kasthuri will
definitely sue us.

2033
01:46:54,350 --> 01:46:55,765
by any logic, you all will be shut down.

2034
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:57,990
Then, it will make headlines...
and you will be answerable...

2035
01:46:58,121 --> 01:46:59,961
to your families and conscience!

2036
01:47:00,063 --> 01:47:01,743
Why're you confusing everyone?

2037
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:04,951
people don't know what to do
with 5 years of power!

2038
01:47:04,976 --> 01:47:06,296
what can you do in two bloody days?

2039
01:47:06,321 --> 01:47:08,721
He's right. What can we do in 2 days?

2040
01:47:09,471 --> 01:47:11,591
Do you think I'll have loose ends
in my plan?

2041
01:47:11,662 --> 01:47:13,982
Just trust me and do as I say!

2042
01:47:14,118 --> 01:47:18,297
If nothing happens out of it;
then beat me up like Kennedy!

2043
01:47:18,322 --> 01:47:20,122
I really didn't hit you.

2044
01:47:20,147 --> 01:47:21,578
He makes sense...

2045
01:47:21,603 --> 01:47:23,403
It's just a matter of two days.

2046
01:47:23,843 --> 01:47:25,429
So far, we've openly committed mistakes;

2047
01:47:25,454 --> 01:47:28,054
for once let's do some good,
behind shut doors!

2048
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:30,279
Arivu, the QC department agrees.

2049
01:47:30,383 --> 01:47:31,423
I'll do it.

2050
01:47:31,448 --> 01:47:33,203
What do the others have to say?

2051
01:47:33,228 --> 01:47:36,468
We'll all do it.

2052
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:39,370
We too will...

2053
01:47:43,006 --> 01:47:45,366
- Shall we begin tomorrow?
- Yes we will.

2054
01:47:45,601 --> 01:47:46,781
Now say it with confidence...

2055
01:47:46,806 --> 01:47:48,806
We're the best!

2056
01:47:48,831 --> 01:47:51,191
- We're the best!
- We're the best!

2057
01:47:55,478 --> 01:47:57,318
If could do this for just 2 days

2058
01:47:57,383 --> 01:47:59,583
we can build it up manifold,
with your marketing.

2059
01:47:59,608 --> 01:48:00,488
Amazing!

2060
01:48:00,645 --> 01:48:05,485
I'll prove a point to our boss,
by turning them against him.

2061
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:08,010
I'll threaten him with
kasthuri's video too.

2062
01:48:08,141 --> 01:48:13,261
I'll force him to manufacture
quality goods.

2063
01:48:13,689 --> 01:48:16,249
So, I would need small favors from you.

2064
01:48:16,439 --> 01:48:18,759
Ask me for big favors!

2065
01:48:19,111 --> 01:48:21,551
I'll gladly do it. I'm sorry
for not believing you earlier.

2066
01:48:21,708 --> 01:48:23,268
I'll never leave your side.

2067
01:48:23,607 --> 01:48:24,527
Thank you sir.

2068
01:48:31,519 --> 01:48:32,919
Check this out!

2069
01:48:33,775 --> 01:48:36,735
the guys who rooted
for their companies...

2070
01:48:36,846 --> 01:48:39,366
are now rooting for the consumers.

2071
01:48:39,647 --> 01:48:41,807
We're winning big!

2072
01:48:42,831 --> 01:48:43,591
Sorry

2073
01:48:43,943 --> 01:48:46,223
He's our marketing head Mr.Aadhi;

2074
01:48:46,471 --> 01:48:47,471
my mentor!

2075
01:48:47,684 --> 01:48:50,364
Arivu's work is something great!

2076
01:48:50,967 --> 01:48:52,447
He'll achieve it!

2077
01:48:53,046 --> 01:48:55,406
You don't have to run behind
courts anymore.

2078
01:48:55,559 --> 01:48:58,079
If Arivu wins, I'll be happy.

2079
01:48:58,389 --> 01:49:02,469
If not, I'll fight against Saffron.

2080
01:49:03,541 --> 01:49:06,341
This struggle isn't just
to fight Saffron...

2081
01:49:06,487 --> 01:49:08,047
Saffron is just a sample;

2082
01:49:08,255 --> 01:49:13,935
We have to fight the
remaining 5 companies.

2083
01:49:14,701 --> 01:49:15,581
Five?

2084
01:49:15,999 --> 01:49:17,839
I told you only about 4.

2085
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:19,520
You forgot to mention New Fedora...

2086
01:49:19,653 --> 01:49:20,573
They are dangerous.

2087
01:49:20,598 --> 01:49:22,318
This plan includes them too.

2088
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:25,429
Every product that comes out
after May 1st

2089
01:49:25,454 --> 01:49:27,054
should be world class!

2090
01:49:27,481 --> 01:49:29,201
Only then, it's a win for us!

2091
01:49:31,213 --> 01:49:33,853
With great fervor,
I made this company mine...

2092
01:49:34,207 --> 01:49:37,127
but he trawled the workers to his side.

2093
01:49:38,815 --> 01:49:42,575
He broke their loyalty for us,
right in front of me!

2094
01:49:43,526 --> 01:49:44,646
It's wrong.

2095
01:49:44,988 --> 01:49:48,948
He made me realize that...
we took their loyalty for granted.

2096
01:49:49,142 --> 01:49:52,222
Even the workers realized
their loyalty was misused!

2097
01:49:52,302 --> 01:49:54,902
I could feel it, only
when it slipped away.

2098
01:49:55,570 --> 01:49:58,812
What will we do without it?

2099
01:49:58,837 --> 01:49:59,997
Put him in place...

2100
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:02,270
There's no use in destroying him.

2101
01:50:03,247 --> 01:50:05,047
We need to destroy his idea.

2102
01:50:05,586 --> 01:50:08,306
Guys like him are our future enemies!

2103
01:50:09,239 --> 01:50:13,999
We knew how to face our opponents
politically and judicially!

2104
01:50:14,057 --> 01:50:17,657
Now we need to prove our capitalism...
to these morons,

2105
01:50:17,776 --> 01:50:22,256
who have sprouted all of a sudden
dealing with emotional cards.

2106
01:50:23,765 --> 01:50:24,805
Not just Saffron...

2107
01:50:25,207 --> 01:50:29,567
he's wagered to bring about a change
in all 5 companies.

2108
01:50:30,564 --> 01:50:33,844
I'll be with him the next two days,

2109
01:50:34,039 --> 01:50:36,079
Using him, I'll buy those companies.

2110
01:50:36,197 --> 01:50:37,237
Only then will I return...

2111
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:39,310
to my seat, as a boss!

2112
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:55,890
Why did you send 10 bags, as always?

2113
01:50:55,930 --> 01:50:58,250
Use 5 bags, and dump the remaining!

2114
01:51:29,985 --> 01:51:31,084
Look here Arivu,

2115
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:35,029
We have reduced the toxin levels
way below the government regulations.

2116
01:51:35,054 --> 01:51:38,134
Even a new born baby can consume it
without fear!

2117
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:50,300
Sir, change the expiry dates to 3 days
instead of 6!

2118
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:04,490
We have done it right!

2119
01:52:27,157 --> 01:52:29,677
I've been working here
for the last 10 years...

2120
01:52:29,886 --> 01:52:34,166
We add more toxins
than the prescribed levels;

2121
01:52:34,491 --> 01:52:36,009
Our bosses may benefit;

2122
01:52:36,061 --> 01:52:38,189
but we're betraying our consumers.

2123
01:52:38,254 --> 01:52:40,534
So we're trying to make products
ethically

2124
01:52:40,597 --> 01:52:42,277
much against our bosses... errr...ugh.

2125
01:52:42,917 --> 01:52:44,557
Arivu, what's this?

2126
01:52:44,702 --> 01:52:46,102
What do think you're doing?

2127
01:52:46,127 --> 01:52:47,607
Can't you do anything right?

2128
01:52:48,815 --> 01:52:51,895
There's a CCTV right there,

2129
01:52:52,087 --> 01:52:54,567
be careful, the MD may come any minute!

2130
01:52:54,654 --> 01:52:55,734
God is great!

2131
01:52:56,886 --> 01:52:59,326
How did you lure him?

2132
01:52:59,351 --> 01:53:04,111
I learnt it from your words
of practical wisdom;

2133
01:53:04,136 --> 01:53:04,856
Practical?

2134
01:53:04,881 --> 01:53:10,521
You told me that he'd do anything to
become a director of the board.

2135
01:53:10,813 --> 01:53:13,573
I told him I'd make him the director.
So, he accepted my offer.

2136
01:53:13,598 --> 01:53:16,478
- How can you make him a director?
- With your help, of course!

2137
01:53:16,627 --> 01:53:17,985
You are MD's close friend

2138
01:53:18,010 --> 01:53:20,930
I'd appreciate your help in this regard.

2139
01:53:21,445 --> 01:53:22,605
Arivu...

2140
01:53:23,438 --> 01:53:25,665
If we have to make bread,
according to rules

2141
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:27,930
we'd have to use more wheat
than plain flour.

2142
01:53:28,214 --> 01:53:30,134
I did exactly that.

2143
01:53:30,375 --> 01:53:31,735
They counted our inventories;

2144
01:53:31,878 --> 01:53:35,638
So I swapped their places.

2145
01:53:35,937 --> 01:53:37,177
Today's problem is over!

2146
01:53:37,598 --> 01:53:39,158
If we do this tomorrow too;

2147
01:53:39,183 --> 01:53:41,001
We can fulfill our promise to you.

2148
01:53:41,026 --> 01:53:42,106
Aren't you happy?

2149
01:53:42,131 --> 01:53:44,051
Yes, we have only one day left

2150
01:53:44,911 --> 01:53:48,259
I've shared this with the union leaders
of the other 5 companies.

2151
01:53:48,334 --> 01:53:51,014
But, they seem to be apprehensive.

2152
01:53:51,239 --> 01:53:53,239
It'll be better if you
address this directly.

2153
01:53:53,479 --> 01:53:54,314
He's Arivu.

2154
01:53:54,339 --> 01:53:55,095
I am Madhavan

2155
01:53:55,423 --> 01:53:55,959
Thank you sir.

2156
01:53:55,984 --> 01:53:56,824
Greetings! I am Karthik

2157
01:53:56,849 --> 01:53:57,929
- Thanks sir
- Jeeva

2158
01:53:58,061 --> 01:53:59,821
- Henson chicken company.
- Thank you for coming.

2159
01:53:59,846 --> 01:54:02,766
New Fedora, mixing department.
We came 4 people for our company

2160
01:54:05,223 --> 01:54:07,343
We would like to do this
in our company too, but...

2161
01:54:07,469 --> 01:54:08,446
it isn't easy at all.

2162
01:54:08,471 --> 01:54:10,391
Our company is too strict,
we can't do it.

2163
01:54:10,748 --> 01:54:12,948
- It isn't possible
- Just a minute.

2164
01:54:13,262 --> 01:54:15,423
I didn't ask you to do any of
these things we did.

2165
01:54:15,448 --> 01:54:16,009
Then?

2166
01:54:16,034 --> 01:54:17,354
Just do one thing;

2167
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:19,149
While you go to work tomorrow...

2168
01:54:19,224 --> 01:54:22,144
just wear a white cloth
over your shoulder!

2169
01:54:22,224 --> 01:54:24,824
- What is he saying?
- How will it be enough?

2170
01:54:25,782 --> 01:54:27,024
Are you for real?

2171
01:54:27,049 --> 01:54:29,049
How is that enough?

2172
01:54:29,074 --> 01:54:30,954
That is more than enough!

2173
01:54:31,259 --> 01:54:33,517
What do we say if someone asks us
the reason for it?

2174
01:54:33,846 --> 01:54:35,766
Just say, "It's for nothing"

2175
01:54:35,791 --> 01:54:37,876
"For nothing?"

2176
01:54:38,252 --> 01:54:40,532
Bro, what's this?

2177
01:54:40,631 --> 01:54:42,511
What purpose is it gonna serve?

2178
01:54:42,614 --> 01:54:44,534
Just have a little faith in me.

2179
01:54:44,785 --> 01:54:46,431
It'll bear fruits in just 2 days.

2180
01:54:46,456 --> 01:54:49,096
He's asking us for a simple favor...

2181
01:54:49,181 --> 01:54:52,704
my subordinates and myself
will follow that.

2182
01:54:52,729 --> 01:54:53,729
I'll do it..

2183
01:54:54,084 --> 01:54:55,004
Me too!

2184
01:54:55,029 --> 01:54:56,509
We'll all do it!

2185
01:54:59,311 --> 01:55:03,311
You're listening to Radio Mirchi:98.3,
with RJ Sha!

2186
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:05,679
Day after tomorrow is May 1st,
labor day

2187
01:55:05,704 --> 01:55:07,984
In lieu of that, we have a guest
in our studio

2188
01:55:08,055 --> 01:55:10,767
...the social media star, Mrinalini!

2189
01:55:10,792 --> 01:55:14,392
I'm here to talk about
something important.

2190
01:55:14,707 --> 01:55:16,907
Sir, let me listen to the radio.

2191
01:55:17,636 --> 01:55:21,306
His name is Arivu...

2192
01:55:21,390 --> 01:55:26,310
He wanted to do something significant
for labor's day

2193
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:29,189
And he has done it!

2194
01:55:29,221 --> 01:55:34,341
He has vowed to prove himself;
as the best worker!

2195
01:55:34,422 --> 01:55:38,087
I'm as eager as you guys
to listen to what he has to say!

2196
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:40,232
Don't miss it, tomorrow at 6pm.

2197
01:55:40,373 --> 01:55:42,078
Stay tuned to Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM...

2198
01:55:42,103 --> 01:55:43,210
Earlier it was just marketing...

2199
01:55:43,353 --> 01:55:44,798
but now...we have started our
promotions as well...

2200
01:55:44,823 --> 01:55:47,743
We'll manufacture ethical goods
in all 6 companies,

2201
01:55:47,768 --> 01:55:49,888
and reach it to people on May 1st.

2202
01:55:50,069 --> 01:55:52,001
And we'll announce it proudly on radio!

2203
01:55:52,041 --> 01:55:53,881
Aren't we good workers now?

2204
01:55:54,991 --> 01:55:56,311
But we have only one day

2205
01:55:56,336 --> 01:55:58,376
But we made them do to a simple favour

2206
01:55:58,462 --> 01:55:59,902
How they can make a good products?

2207
01:55:59,927 --> 01:56:00,647
Sir...

2208
01:56:00,901 --> 01:56:02,541
I coaxed just the workers
in our company;

2209
01:56:02,612 --> 01:56:04,772
But, I'm negotiating directly with
the owners in the other 5 companies!

2210
01:56:04,797 --> 01:56:07,037
The owners are waiting for us now.

2211
01:56:07,197 --> 01:56:07,957
How?

2212
01:56:08,124 --> 01:56:08,804
Sir...

2213
01:56:08,942 --> 01:56:11,222
That's the power of our
sample marketing.

2214
01:56:11,516 --> 01:56:13,380
You should join hands with Das...

2215
01:56:13,405 --> 01:56:15,205
He's the reason I'm admitted here.

2216
01:56:15,294 --> 01:56:16,414
Do this for me, please bro!

2217
01:56:16,439 --> 01:56:18,679
Look at what you did!
Look at Kasi...

2218
01:56:18,814 --> 01:56:20,414
You're the reason for it.

2219
01:56:20,687 --> 01:56:21,807
We won't leave you

2220
01:56:21,832 --> 01:56:23,752
I'll kill him...

2221
01:56:24,167 --> 01:56:24,927
Bro...

2222
01:56:25,155 --> 01:56:28,795
- Thank God, you're awake!
- Put the weapon down.

2223
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:30,066
It's not his fault.

2224
01:56:30,137 --> 01:56:32,137
He took his revenge on me,
that's all!

2225
01:56:32,324 --> 01:56:33,924
Let him go.

2226
01:56:33,949 --> 01:56:34,989
Kasi bro...

2227
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:37,930
I tried to kill you, without realizing
what a gem of a person you are!

2228
01:56:37,955 --> 01:56:38,955
Please forgive me.

2229
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:41,784
I'll do anything for you, henceforth!

2230
01:56:41,809 --> 01:56:44,489
I've summoned these officials for you;

2231
01:56:44,661 --> 01:56:46,461
Shoot your questions to them.

2232
01:56:47,043 --> 01:56:48,883
From the long list of these
honchos' crimes;

2233
01:56:48,908 --> 01:56:50,668
could you reveal just a few?

2234
01:56:51,781 --> 01:56:53,181
There was a lot of them...

2235
01:56:53,206 --> 01:56:56,686
I threatened each one of them...
rather strongly!

2236
01:56:56,711 --> 01:56:57,951
They came running to me.

2237
01:56:58,772 --> 01:56:59,772
Everybody?

2238
01:57:00,069 --> 01:57:01,949
Does it include New Fedora's boss too?

2239
01:57:01,974 --> 01:57:03,878
yes, it includes the Owl faced dork too!

2240
01:57:03,969 --> 01:57:06,169
Hey, mind it...he's a reputed man!

2241
01:57:06,335 --> 01:57:09,455
You're right, but...
he has a major weakness!

2242
01:57:09,984 --> 01:57:12,304
His secretary, Philomina...

2243
01:57:12,615 --> 01:57:15,535
He's having an affair with her,
for a long time now.

2244
01:57:15,668 --> 01:57:17,488
Das has filmed it on tape.

2245
01:57:17,513 --> 01:57:18,699
Why did you stop the car?

2246
01:57:18,724 --> 01:57:20,004
Excited to see it right away?

2247
01:57:20,254 --> 01:57:21,334
- Hang on
- No...

2248
01:57:21,381 --> 01:57:23,781
Even Das' boys loved the video!

2249
01:57:24,090 --> 01:57:25,480
Sir, old and young combination

2250
01:57:25,505 --> 01:57:26,261
No

2251
01:57:26,286 --> 01:57:27,566
Sir, watch it

2252
01:57:27,629 --> 01:57:29,669
It's as interesting as real porn!

2253
01:57:30,975 --> 01:57:32,335
Damn it dad...

2254
01:57:38,654 --> 01:57:41,134
You could have laughed in front of me...

2255
01:57:41,279 --> 01:57:43,319
You're way too decent.

2256
01:57:44,487 --> 01:57:45,647
What's the plan now?

2257
01:57:45,672 --> 01:57:46,552
Sample 1...

2258
01:57:46,592 --> 01:57:47,992
They're shocked, so they're here.

2259
01:57:48,017 --> 01:57:48,480
Sample 2...

2260
01:57:48,505 --> 01:57:50,105
we'll show them what happened
at Saffron,

2261
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:51,074
and threaten them with that.

2262
01:57:51,147 --> 01:57:52,627
Sample 3,...the protest cloth

2263
01:57:52,838 --> 01:57:54,598
Sample 4... is via emotion!

2264
01:58:04,993 --> 01:58:06,273
I'll come to the point...

2265
01:58:06,496 --> 01:58:09,856
In all your food products
there's a cocktail of toxic chemicals

2266
01:58:09,881 --> 01:58:12,641
It in fact exceeds the
government regulations.

2267
01:58:12,799 --> 01:58:14,999
This should be curbed
with immediate effect!

2268
01:58:15,024 --> 01:58:16,984
We have the authorities
in our pockets...

2269
01:58:17,133 --> 01:58:18,566
who are you to question us?

2270
01:58:18,591 --> 01:58:21,391
The officers won't question,
nor will the authorities;

2271
01:58:21,596 --> 01:58:23,050
but I will question you...

2272
01:58:23,088 --> 01:58:25,048
I mean, a worker will question you!

2273
01:58:25,299 --> 01:58:27,299
Can I say something shocking?

2274
01:58:27,324 --> 01:58:29,386
This change is happening right now

2275
01:58:29,411 --> 01:58:31,011
in India's leading company, Saffron!

2276
01:58:31,056 --> 01:58:33,936
We are manufacturing good products
without our MD's knowledge!

2277
01:58:33,961 --> 01:58:36,161
We aren't scared to work ethically.

2278
01:58:36,895 --> 01:58:38,735
You've after all changed one company...

2279
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:40,534
Doesn't mean you can change
the whole industry.

2280
01:58:40,638 --> 01:58:43,318
Sir, can I tell you an even more
shocking news?

2281
01:58:43,407 --> 01:58:46,967
This change is already happening
in your firms.

2282
01:58:46,992 --> 01:58:48,855
as a gesture of protest...

2283
01:58:49,242 --> 01:58:51,792
everybody is wearing a cloth
over their shoulder.

2284
01:58:51,817 --> 01:58:53,697
Are these guys wearing a white cloth?

2285
01:58:54,375 --> 01:58:56,695
Yes, all of these guys are...

2286
01:58:57,129 --> 01:58:58,609
Ask them why...

2287
01:58:58,851 --> 01:58:59,956
and they'll say it's nothing!

2288
01:59:00,038 --> 01:59:01,198
Ask them why they are wearing it.

2289
01:59:01,223 --> 01:59:03,463
- Why are you wearing this cloth?
- It's nothing.

2290
01:59:03,488 --> 01:59:04,888
They're saying it's nothing.

2291
01:59:09,725 --> 01:59:11,089
You don't have money making skills;

2292
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:13,519
So are you here to loot from us?

2293
01:59:13,544 --> 01:59:14,544
Okay, name your price!

2294
01:59:14,569 --> 01:59:17,289
I'm not interested in your money
or status;

2295
01:59:17,886 --> 01:59:19,526
We never wanted to be one of you!

2296
01:59:19,703 --> 01:59:21,103
Bosses are bosses...

2297
01:59:21,655 --> 01:59:23,415
We're mere workers...

2298
01:59:23,791 --> 01:59:25,391
We came to just work

2299
01:59:25,534 --> 01:59:26,894
not to commit crimes.

2300
01:59:27,455 --> 01:59:29,975
If you follow the regulations;

2301
01:59:30,062 --> 01:59:31,782
you'll only lose from your profits.

2302
01:59:32,271 --> 01:59:34,151
but our whole lives will be profited!

2303
01:59:34,176 --> 01:59:37,296
We'll give quality goods to people.

2304
01:59:37,741 --> 01:59:40,021
Please sir!

2305
01:59:47,340 --> 01:59:48,808
Wait for 10 minutes.

2306
01:59:48,862 --> 01:59:51,702
We'll call you after a brief discussion.

2307
01:59:56,151 --> 01:59:58,711
Sir, I guess they were bowled over!

2308
01:59:58,736 --> 02:00:00,216
Give me your hands...

2309
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:02,559
I'll tell this to Miru right away!

2310
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:04,230
How dare he use that tone with us?

2311
02:00:04,502 --> 02:00:05,582
This guy is zilch!

2312
02:00:05,727 --> 02:00:07,447
we have seen too many people
like him.

2313
02:00:07,550 --> 02:00:09,310
You guys don't understand...

2314
02:00:09,382 --> 02:00:11,662
His motives aren't selfish.

2315
02:00:13,020 --> 02:00:16,260
His questions are logical
and reasonable;

2316
02:00:16,285 --> 02:00:19,885
plus he has turned our workers
against us.

2317
02:00:19,910 --> 02:00:23,950
I can't risk it with my daughter's
wedding by the side;

2318
02:00:24,365 --> 02:00:28,685
I'm scared of losing my name
by fighting a guy like him.

2319
02:00:28,981 --> 02:00:30,741
We'll talk to him...

2320
02:00:31,103 --> 02:00:31,743
Fuck!

2321
02:00:36,662 --> 02:00:38,542
Arivu, come here.

2322
02:00:39,156 --> 02:00:39,917
Sir, what's it?

2323
02:00:39,942 --> 02:00:41,222
We are doomed!

2324
02:00:41,935 --> 02:00:43,535
I heard everything they said.

2325
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:45,360
Do you know what they are saying?

2326
02:00:45,385 --> 02:00:47,305
They think you're acting all noble.

2327
02:00:47,717 --> 02:00:50,277
I planned everything to a T;

2328
02:00:50,302 --> 02:00:51,441
this should have worked out favorably.

2329
02:00:51,466 --> 02:00:52,746
Am I fool then?

2330
02:00:54,101 --> 02:00:55,141
What did you say?

2331
02:00:55,442 --> 02:00:58,242
That you came to work,
not to commit crimes!

2332
02:00:58,267 --> 02:01:03,827
They have twisted its entire meaning,
and making fun of you.

2333
02:01:04,972 --> 02:01:06,732
I just want to get out of this mess.

2334
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:07,800
Come in...

2335
02:01:07,967 --> 02:01:09,287
We were thinking about your proposal.

2336
02:01:09,312 --> 02:01:10,072
The hell you did!

2337
02:01:10,097 --> 02:01:11,337
Talk properly moron!

2338
02:01:11,446 --> 02:01:12,966
As if you are perfect...

2339
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:15,670
Why should I respect
unethical ba****ds like you?

2340
02:01:15,992 --> 02:01:18,032
He's built his factory by
destroying a family;

2341
02:01:18,057 --> 02:01:20,417
You, killed your daughter's lover

2342
02:01:20,590 --> 02:01:21,950
I don't wanna negotiate anymore!

2343
02:01:21,975 --> 02:01:24,316
When I come back tomorrow, I want all
your signatures on the agreement.

2344
02:01:24,341 --> 02:01:25,181
If not...

2345
02:01:25,338 --> 02:01:28,658
I'll leak all your private videos
and trend #CEO leaks across media!

2346
02:01:28,894 --> 02:01:29,934
Hey jumbo!

2347
02:01:30,653 --> 02:01:31,613
Philomina?

2348
02:01:32,606 --> 02:01:35,566
How do you get chicks when
you can't even function properly?

2349
02:01:36,022 --> 02:01:38,422
Your signature should be the
first one on the list!

2350
02:01:38,679 --> 02:01:40,279
Playing games with me?

2351
02:01:40,806 --> 02:01:41,566
Sir, let's go!

2352
02:01:41,934 --> 02:01:43,334
Superb Arivu!

2353
02:01:45,774 --> 02:01:46,534
Will this work out?

2354
02:01:46,559 --> 02:01:47,639
A one hundred percent!

2355
02:01:47,785 --> 02:01:50,105
This is why I need you!

2356
02:01:50,526 --> 02:01:51,886
What's the plan now?

2357
02:01:51,911 --> 02:01:54,071
We need to check the 2nd day samples.

2358
02:01:54,246 --> 02:01:58,806
I wanted to go over the agreement
details with them, if you are here.

2359
02:01:58,831 --> 02:02:00,271
It'll be too technical;

2360
02:02:00,296 --> 02:02:02,976
you please deal with it.

2361
02:02:03,001 --> 02:02:04,481
I'll be back for signing.

2362
02:02:04,943 --> 02:02:05,753
Okay?

2363
02:02:05,832 --> 02:02:07,832
- See you, bye.
- Love you sir!

2364
02:02:15,502 --> 02:02:17,302
How can he disrespect us?

2365
02:02:17,574 --> 02:02:19,934
Do you know why I'm patient?

2366
02:02:20,199 --> 02:02:21,759
I knew about him already.

2367
02:02:22,463 --> 02:02:24,383
The guy with Arivu is my spy.

2368
02:02:28,891 --> 02:02:30,931
Your workers are with Arivu.

2369
02:02:31,238 --> 02:02:34,398
Using them, he will give you hell.

2370
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:38,439
Did you notice his crude lingo?

2371
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:40,359
He won't return your videos

2372
02:02:40,384 --> 02:02:42,664
He has other plans.

2373
02:02:43,094 --> 02:02:45,014
That's what happened in Saffron

2374
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:46,530
I told him too.

2375
02:02:46,746 --> 02:02:50,386
For the sole reason to come out
of this mess

2376
02:02:50,559 --> 02:02:53,199
Saffron's MD handed over
the company to him.

2377
02:02:53,224 --> 02:02:54,344
Sir, the agreement?

2378
02:02:55,581 --> 02:02:56,381
Look at this.

2379
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:59,590
Did you know why I acquired Saffron?

2380
02:02:59,677 --> 02:03:02,357
I wanted to teach him a lesson,
not minding my losses!

2381
02:03:02,382 --> 02:03:06,620
Write over your major shares to me.

2382
02:03:06,645 --> 02:03:09,725
I'll settle your monies right away.

2383
02:03:10,019 --> 02:03:13,175
Make me your deciding authority.

2384
02:03:13,255 --> 02:03:14,895
I'll annihilate him after that.

2385
02:03:15,021 --> 02:03:17,621
He won't let this go.

2386
02:03:17,895 --> 02:03:20,095
Rather than accepting Arivu's demands;

2387
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:22,824
we can retain our dignity.

2388
02:03:22,898 --> 02:03:27,018
Not only that, I'll get
your videos back.

2389
02:03:29,555 --> 02:03:33,395
We have suffered a lot to do this job
without boss's knowledge

2390
02:03:36,016 --> 02:03:39,096
I felt relaxed to think, we will
go for work as usual from tomorrow

2391
02:03:41,942 --> 02:03:43,394
My hands are shivering

2392
02:03:43,419 --> 02:03:45,379
I'm going blind...

2393
02:03:45,783 --> 02:03:47,103
I'm not even able to talk.

2394
02:03:47,798 --> 02:03:49,918
Act for your money's worth.

2395
02:03:50,216 --> 02:03:52,878
My health's ruined because of this...

2396
02:03:52,903 --> 02:03:54,223
Say it credibly!

2397
02:03:55,934 --> 02:03:57,534
- Sir...
- Watch the telly...

2398
02:03:57,590 --> 02:04:00,110
- What's it?
- Something's horribly wrong!

2399
02:04:02,022 --> 02:04:05,102
It's because of Saffron.

2400
02:04:05,127 --> 02:04:09,127
Doctored videos are doing rounds,
to extract money from big corporations.

2401
02:04:09,167 --> 02:04:11,207
Cops have arrested one such gang today.

2402
02:04:11,414 --> 02:04:13,334
It looks exactly like Kasthuri's video.

2403
02:04:14,799 --> 02:04:16,759
You don't know anything right?

2404
02:04:16,909 --> 02:04:18,709
See you at office.

2405
02:04:23,214 --> 02:04:25,214
So my battle will last 4 months.

2406
02:04:25,766 --> 02:04:27,331
This video looks like the one
Arivu showed us.

2407
02:04:27,356 --> 02:04:28,196
Exactly.

2408
02:04:29,342 --> 02:04:31,942
This looks just like Kasthuri's video.

2409
02:04:32,176 --> 02:04:32,976
Is Arivu there?

2410
02:04:33,133 --> 02:04:33,659
Tell me.

2411
02:04:33,684 --> 02:04:35,804
- CEO wanted me to fetch you.
- What?

2412
02:04:43,175 --> 02:04:45,455
Did you watch the news?

2413
02:04:45,734 --> 02:04:46,774
Shocking, isn't it?

2414
02:04:46,855 --> 02:04:49,015
I bought those companies over,
with your help.

2415
02:04:49,262 --> 02:04:51,182
Including Saffron.

2416
02:04:51,919 --> 02:04:53,119
Hard to comprehend?

2417
02:04:53,455 --> 02:04:54,815
You'll understand soon.

2418
02:05:07,847 --> 02:05:11,247
They took away my company
because of you

2419
02:05:11,272 --> 02:05:13,152
Won't you use your brains?

2420
02:05:13,177 --> 02:05:16,457
He has spun a fictional tale,
using a pseudonym Kasthuri.

2421
02:05:16,615 --> 02:05:18,566
He has cheated you sentimentally.

2422
02:05:18,591 --> 02:05:19,791
and benefitted from it.

2423
02:05:19,974 --> 02:05:22,014
The next MD is all the more ruthless.

2424
02:05:22,187 --> 02:05:23,787
He won't spare you.

2425
02:05:34,751 --> 02:05:35,791
Come Arivu

2426
02:05:45,343 --> 02:05:47,063
What are you looking?

2427
02:05:47,774 --> 02:05:50,294
Your ex-MD must have mentioned me.

2428
02:05:50,460 --> 02:05:52,660
The reason for this is my trusty Arivu!

2429
02:05:52,685 --> 02:05:53,685
Good job Arivu.

2430
02:05:54,157 --> 02:05:55,157
It was only because of him,

2431
02:05:55,212 --> 02:05:58,892
I was able to identify
disloyal employees.

2432
02:05:58,917 --> 02:06:00,557
Better work sincerely;

2433
02:06:00,629 --> 02:06:03,509
Yet, if you wanna play smart
you'll face the consequences.

2434
02:06:03,534 --> 02:06:04,374
Come.

2435
02:06:06,007 --> 02:06:08,087
You're a world class con artist!

2436
02:06:08,389 --> 02:06:11,349
I never laid my hands on you;
yet you pretended to be hurt.

2437
02:06:11,636 --> 02:06:12,745
And spoke an impromptu line; saying

2438
02:06:12,770 --> 02:06:17,130
That you weren't hurt by my slap;
but hurt by our collective ignorance.

2439
02:06:17,475 --> 02:06:18,652
That line hurts me now!

2440
02:06:18,677 --> 02:06:19,917
We trusted you...

2441
02:06:19,942 --> 02:06:21,742
Why did you get us in to this mess?

2442
02:06:22,372 --> 02:06:23,542
Stella sir

2443
02:06:24,054 --> 02:06:26,374
I know you must be angry on Arivu...

2444
02:06:26,837 --> 02:06:29,777
Insult him in front of the workers
and shoo him away from here.

2445
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:33,200
You are motivated us against our boss

2446
02:06:33,637 --> 02:06:36,197
I'll talk to the MD about
your promotion.

2447
02:06:36,785 --> 02:06:37,503
Don't do anything now;

2448
02:06:37,528 --> 02:06:38,761
hit him after I speak.

2449
02:06:38,786 --> 02:06:40,746
Is this the reward you were
planning to give us?

2450
02:06:41,145 --> 02:06:42,305
Was this your intention?

2451
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:42,878
No bro...

2452
02:06:42,903 --> 02:06:45,230
Don't mistake Arivu, please...
there's a ploy behind it.

2453
02:06:45,255 --> 02:06:46,775
He's not the reason for any of this.

2454
02:06:46,936 --> 02:06:47,816
Please believe me.

2455
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:50,120
Rght from the minute he stepped in;

2456
02:06:50,145 --> 02:06:51,667
he's been manipulating us.

2457
02:06:51,850 --> 02:06:53,738
How long do you think you can con us?

2458
02:06:53,763 --> 02:06:57,523
Didn't I say he'd be trouble?

2459
02:06:58,383 --> 02:07:00,903
What shall we do?
Should we forgive him?

2460
02:07:01,606 --> 02:07:04,566
Don't hit him... please.

2461
02:07:04,591 --> 02:07:06,111
He's innocent.

2462
02:07:06,476 --> 02:07:08,036
Get away, all of you.

2463
02:07:08,395 --> 02:07:10,035
Enough of this...

2464
02:07:10,060 --> 02:07:12,220
let's get back to business.

2465
02:07:12,245 --> 02:07:13,085
Arivu, come.

2466
02:07:15,607 --> 02:07:17,247
Let's work properly.

2467
02:07:17,885 --> 02:07:19,045
You stay away...

2468
02:07:19,255 --> 02:07:20,375
I'll deal with it.

2469
02:07:21,902 --> 02:07:24,702
I feel bad for you.

2470
02:07:26,990 --> 02:07:28,990
I feel bad too.

2471
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:31,320
Since this was a big initiative;

2472
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:33,316
and involved the lives of other workers,

2473
02:07:33,341 --> 02:07:35,316
I was way too careful.

2474
02:07:35,823 --> 02:07:38,463
I had all exit strategies!

2475
02:07:39,108 --> 02:07:42,188
and various plans in place.

2476
02:07:42,717 --> 02:07:44,277
My friends warned me then.

2477
02:07:44,428 --> 02:07:47,308
It's impossible to satisfy everybody.

2478
02:07:47,333 --> 02:07:48,956
a few will oppose.

2479
02:07:48,981 --> 02:07:50,901
But I tried to please my opponents too.

2480
02:07:52,656 --> 02:07:54,216
Stella Bruce...

2481
02:07:54,241 --> 02:07:57,041
You want us to oppose our bosses
and remain jobless?

2482
02:07:57,574 --> 02:08:00,440
- His plans won't work.
- That's what I'm saying too.

2483
02:08:00,620 --> 02:08:02,441
I used him for my sake

2484
02:08:03,504 --> 02:08:08,104
I assumed all possibilities; but
didn't realize I'll be betrayed.

2485
02:08:08,896 --> 02:08:10,410
Why're you still here?

2486
02:08:10,481 --> 02:08:11,683
Aadhi told me to hit you.

2487
02:08:12,721 --> 02:08:14,401
He isn't your mentor, but a traitor.

2488
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:16,470
Don't trust him.

2489
02:08:18,774 --> 02:08:19,934
Why did you do it?

2490
02:08:20,454 --> 02:08:21,934
Damn it, Why?

2491
02:08:21,959 --> 02:08:23,519
I revered you!

2492
02:08:23,655 --> 02:08:26,335
I thought you stood by me.

2493
02:08:26,565 --> 02:08:30,005
Inspite of knowing the repercussions...

2494
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:34,660
How could you do this to
your own colleagues?

2495
02:08:35,719 --> 02:08:36,599
Worker?

2496
02:08:36,822 --> 02:08:43,542
I was destined to be a boss,
even before my birth.

2497
02:08:47,884 --> 02:08:51,808
Saffron's new MD is proposing the board;

2498
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:53,816
to appoint his son as the CEO!

2499
02:08:53,919 --> 02:08:55,399
His only son...

2500
02:08:55,895 --> 02:08:56,975
Adhiban Madhav...

2501
02:08:59,326 --> 02:09:01,246
Arivu, that's me!

2502
02:09:05,806 --> 02:09:09,206
Does being a boss entitle you
to treat me like shit?

2503
02:09:09,231 --> 02:09:11,511
Can't you see my point of reasoning?

2504
02:09:13,358 --> 02:09:14,198
Arivu...

2505
02:09:15,238 --> 02:09:17,038
You're living in LaLa Land!

2506
02:09:17,366 --> 02:09:18,966
Your thoughts are mere fantasy!

2507
02:09:19,143 --> 02:09:22,143
Here, only the boss should get
what he wants!

2508
02:09:22,502 --> 02:09:24,262
That's Corporate!

2509
02:09:24,368 --> 02:09:25,928
And that's growth!

2510
02:09:26,046 --> 02:09:28,326
Don't mind the collateral damage!

2511
02:09:28,638 --> 02:09:30,278
According to you, it's poison.

2512
02:09:30,535 --> 02:09:32,455
Is this crap called growth?

2513
02:09:33,682 --> 02:09:36,202
How many of you eat your own poison?

2514
02:09:36,553 --> 02:09:38,633
Or use your own products?

2515
02:09:38,798 --> 02:09:40,958
You guys eat organic...

2516
02:09:40,983 --> 02:09:42,623
and use the best imported products.

2517
02:09:42,648 --> 02:09:45,168
But you want us to consume poison
for your profits!

2518
02:09:45,347 --> 02:09:46,042
What did you just say?

2519
02:09:46,129 --> 02:09:48,129
"Only the boss should get
what he wants!"

2520
02:09:48,247 --> 02:09:50,367
First, let poor people get
at least something!

2521
02:09:50,392 --> 02:09:51,632
We're struggling for that.

2522
02:09:51,657 --> 02:09:52,217
Look...

2523
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:54,240
I don't care how big you are!

2524
02:09:54,431 --> 02:09:56,231
I'll walk all over you!

2525
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:59,176
Won't you ever change?

2526
02:10:00,317 --> 02:10:01,837
Listen up...

2527
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:03,560
On May 1st,

2528
02:10:03,772 --> 02:10:06,386
the day you wanted to show
the might of workers,

2529
02:10:06,423 --> 02:10:10,143
I'll show you the power of a boss!

2530
02:10:10,168 --> 02:10:14,568
I'll accept that you broke their
loyalty for their bosses!

2531
02:10:14,662 --> 02:10:16,902
But if I have to win it back;

2532
02:10:16,927 --> 02:10:19,167
I can't just be a boss.

2533
02:10:19,374 --> 02:10:21,574
I should return as a savior!

2534
02:10:21,999 --> 02:10:24,359
They should revere me as their God!

2535
02:10:24,820 --> 02:10:28,380
I'll make them beg me, to take over!

2536
02:10:28,702 --> 02:10:33,582
In sometime;
I'll make you say it too.

2537
02:10:33,895 --> 02:10:36,975
I'll create a few problems first.

2538
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,160
I myself will bail them out of it.

2539
02:10:40,413 --> 02:10:43,493
If you try to act heroic;

2540
02:10:43,751 --> 02:10:45,671
I won't provide any solutions

2541
02:10:45,696 --> 02:10:47,096
I'll leave them with just problems.

2542
02:10:47,370 --> 02:10:52,250
Make a choice between
the workers and your campaign!

2543
02:10:52,446 --> 02:10:55,086
This is the first problem. Come on.

2544
02:10:56,358 --> 02:10:57,824
This is the food inspection squad.

2545
02:10:57,903 --> 02:11:02,583
They'll study the toxin free samples
you made the last two days,

2546
02:11:02,725 --> 02:11:07,765
in comparison with today's.

2547
02:11:25,005 --> 02:11:27,525
Do you even know what products
they are testing upon?

2548
02:11:28,141 --> 02:11:33,300
They have devised a plan to prove that
the last two samples are standard ones,

2549
02:11:33,325 --> 02:11:35,565
but today's products were
deliberately adulterated.

2550
02:11:35,746 --> 02:11:37,146
Do you understand?

2551
02:11:37,421 --> 02:11:39,355
He doesn't know about this

2552
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:41,100
Didn't I tell you Arivu was innocent?

2553
02:11:42,086 --> 02:11:44,246
I won't let this be!

2554
02:11:44,372 --> 02:11:45,972
I'll make your dreams true

2555
02:11:47,257 --> 02:11:48,377
What do we do now?

2556
02:11:48,402 --> 02:11:50,882
Adhi will handle it.

2557
02:11:57,890 --> 02:11:59,277
He isn't budging.

2558
02:11:59,302 --> 02:12:01,792
he's set the warehouse on fire! to
destroy our last 2 days' samples.

2559
02:12:02,027 --> 02:12:03,107
Go soon.

2560
02:12:04,916 --> 02:12:06,488
Your guys are dying...

2561
02:12:06,513 --> 02:12:07,793
Go on... Go!

2562
02:12:13,610 --> 02:12:15,010
Oh God!

2563
02:12:15,050 --> 02:12:16,290
What's happening?

2564
02:12:17,410 --> 02:12:18,770
Get out...Run...

2565
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:25,360
You broke their loyalty towards us;

2566
02:12:25,477 --> 02:12:28,717
Hence I destroyed your efforts.

2567
02:12:29,694 --> 02:12:30,894
Save me

2568
02:12:32,586 --> 02:12:33,666
Go save him.

2569
02:12:40,804 --> 02:12:42,564
You can't tell them I did this...

2570
02:12:42,924 --> 02:12:45,564
Because they need me to vouch for you.

2571
02:12:52,637 --> 02:12:54,757
What's the hurry?

2572
02:12:54,930 --> 02:12:57,250
Sacrifice at least one life,
for your experiment.

2573
02:13:00,450 --> 02:13:02,010
My legs are trapped.

2574
02:13:06,089 --> 02:13:08,009
Guys... let's save him...

2575
02:13:08,175 --> 02:13:08,935
Hurry!

2576
02:13:09,796 --> 02:13:11,796
Don't look at me, just hurry!

2577
02:13:11,970 --> 02:13:13,732
Hold him...

2578
02:13:13,757 --> 02:13:15,197
Hold his legs

2579
02:13:15,222 --> 02:13:16,582
Move away...

2580
02:13:24,211 --> 02:13:25,171
What did you say?

2581
02:13:25,898 --> 02:13:27,098
Worker for 8 hours...

2582
02:13:27,381 --> 02:13:29,261
but a consumer for 16 hours!

2583
02:13:29,932 --> 02:13:32,452
I'm a pure-bred boss for the entire day!

2584
02:13:32,793 --> 02:13:34,793
Showing off your marketing skills to me?

2585
02:13:40,128 --> 02:13:42,248
Aadhi sir, what's with the injury?

2586
02:13:42,304 --> 02:13:43,504
Sir, what happened?

2587
02:13:43,863 --> 02:13:46,703
We should punish our vicious MD.

2588
02:13:46,871 --> 02:13:49,364
He's destroyed the samples,
we toiled for!

2589
02:13:49,389 --> 02:13:52,549
Once I get the lab results,
I'll send you all to jail.

2590
02:13:52,703 --> 02:13:55,183
I'll burn the entire warehouse down.

2591
02:13:55,277 --> 02:13:57,099
Nobody should dare to do
such things in future!

2592
02:13:57,124 --> 02:13:58,844
We can get him arrested
with this evidence.

2593
02:13:58,869 --> 02:14:00,309
How can we?

2594
02:14:00,334 --> 02:14:02,294
We must punish him

2595
02:14:02,319 --> 02:14:03,599
He is right

2596
02:14:03,742 --> 02:14:05,262
You call the police.

2597
02:14:05,718 --> 02:14:06,758
Call them.

2598
02:14:07,001 --> 02:14:10,401
Sir, I'm Aadhi from Saffron
Global Consumables...

2599
02:14:14,901 --> 02:14:17,941
Police will be here in 10 minutes,
to arrest my dad.

2600
02:14:19,622 --> 02:14:21,102
Bail will be ready in 20.

2601
02:14:32,262 --> 02:14:33,919
Have you gone mad?

2602
02:14:34,009 --> 02:14:35,369
What's the matter?

2603
02:14:35,432 --> 02:14:36,872
Nothing. We'll discuss later.

2604
02:14:37,005 --> 02:14:37,521
Stella sir...

2605
02:14:37,546 --> 02:14:38,857
-What did you say?
- Actually, nothing...

2606
02:14:38,882 --> 02:14:40,722
Though your idea is good,
please keep quiet!

2607
02:14:40,747 --> 02:14:43,107
Why're you hesitating to say it then?

2608
02:14:43,248 --> 02:14:46,208
He wants a fellow worker
to take over the reins,

2609
02:14:46,233 --> 02:14:48,153
for the company's betterment.

2610
02:14:48,232 --> 02:14:49,497
Great idea.

2611
02:14:49,522 --> 02:14:51,282
Why did you hesitate to say it?

2612
02:14:51,664 --> 02:14:52,784
It sounds good to hear,

2613
02:14:53,290 --> 02:14:54,210
but...

2614
02:14:54,370 --> 02:14:56,410
He wants me to become the CEO!

2615
02:14:56,435 --> 02:14:58,515
Is it so important now?

2616
02:14:58,540 --> 02:15:00,140
What's wrong with that?

2617
02:15:00,198 --> 02:15:03,118
You're well-read and thoughtful;

2618
02:15:03,143 --> 02:15:05,463
you care for us and the company!

2619
02:15:05,488 --> 02:15:07,168
what else is required?

2620
02:15:07,193 --> 02:15:09,913
You saved the lives of
42 people today...

2621
02:15:10,054 --> 02:15:12,054
You have become a demi-God
for their families!

2622
02:15:12,117 --> 02:15:14,077
Why can't you become the CEO?

2623
02:15:14,654 --> 02:15:17,494
On behalf of the board of directors...

2624
02:15:17,558 --> 02:15:20,767
we don't have any objection
towards this decision!

2625
02:15:20,792 --> 02:15:21,672
- Am I right?
- Okay!

2626
02:15:22,040 --> 02:15:24,250
Union leaders are okay too!

2627
02:15:24,275 --> 02:15:25,155
Yes we are!

2628
02:15:25,195 --> 02:15:26,115
Is everybody okay?

2629
02:15:26,155 --> 02:15:27,675
Yes, we are

2630
02:15:28,632 --> 02:15:32,392
The board of directors have to agree
to my terms.

2631
02:15:32,512 --> 02:15:34,752
Only then will I take over!

2632
02:15:34,870 --> 02:15:36,070
Here's my friend Arivu...

2633
02:15:36,095 --> 02:15:39,295
Only I know how much he struggled
to make this happen.

2634
02:15:40,414 --> 02:15:43,614
But his dreams were shattered,
right in front of him.

2635
02:15:44,430 --> 02:15:46,470
His dreams might be temporary;

2636
02:15:46,495 --> 02:15:48,815
But what I propose now is permanent!

2637
02:15:48,895 --> 02:15:50,175
From now on...

2638
02:15:50,511 --> 02:15:52,551
we'll follow the government's
regulations.

2639
02:15:52,854 --> 02:15:54,374
Whatever profits or losses we incur;

2640
02:15:54,468 --> 02:15:55,309
will be borne by the company.

2641
02:15:55,383 --> 02:15:57,423
The board of directors should
accept them.

2642
02:15:57,976 --> 02:15:59,536
I made them believe in me!

2643
02:15:59,879 --> 02:16:02,309
I'll make them believe my words too.

2644
02:16:02,334 --> 02:16:03,418
Won't take long!

2645
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:07,080
So far, we only conned the consumers...

2646
02:16:07,782 --> 02:16:08,543
but from now...

2647
02:16:08,568 --> 02:16:10,648
I'll con the workers too.

2648
02:16:10,775 --> 02:16:13,095
I've seen the pain of the workers
from close quarters.

2649
02:16:13,229 --> 02:16:15,192
They don't get paid enough...

2650
02:16:15,491 --> 02:16:19,451
We have to triple their salaries...

2651
02:16:19,476 --> 02:16:20,668
Starting from today.

2652
02:16:20,693 --> 02:16:22,413
As soon as they hear the word "Money"

2653
02:16:22,438 --> 02:16:23,718
these worker dogs...

2654
02:16:24,162 --> 02:16:26,842
will be wagging their tails at me.

2655
02:16:29,476 --> 02:16:32,396
Mr.Aadhi, we have approved
your terms & conditions.

2656
02:16:32,510 --> 02:16:35,470
You're the CEO, for Saffron
group of companies!

2657
02:16:37,370 --> 02:16:38,810
On top of this;

2658
02:16:40,181 --> 02:16:44,101
I want Arivu to whole-heartedly agree
to this decision.

2659
02:16:44,935 --> 02:16:47,535
Arivu, convey your acceptance.

2660
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:48,760
These fools...

2661
02:16:49,223 --> 02:16:54,903
always think others will change
their lives for the better.

2662
02:16:55,581 --> 02:16:56,621
But what they don't know is,

2663
02:16:56,825 --> 02:17:01,505
only they have the power to
change their lives!

2664
02:17:02,149 --> 02:17:06,069
Until then, I'll exploit them
to the fullest!

2665
02:17:09,486 --> 02:17:12,006
Why wouldn't I be okay?

2666
02:17:12,363 --> 02:17:14,363
I want Aadhi to become our CEO.

2667
02:17:16,333 --> 02:17:21,293
Didn't you want to exhibit these
samples to the world?

2668
02:17:21,661 --> 02:17:23,160
All you have remaining, are the ashes!

2669
02:17:23,185 --> 02:17:24,185
Go announce!

2670
02:17:26,961 --> 02:17:29,681
We've been working for
almost a month now

2671
02:17:29,767 --> 02:17:31,687
Due to Arivu's efforts...

2672
02:17:31,712 --> 02:17:34,942
we'll soon be able to get
quality products...

2673
02:17:34,967 --> 02:17:36,426
from these companies!

2674
02:17:36,488 --> 02:17:37,728
Nice to hear

2675
02:17:37,753 --> 02:17:40,353
We'll ask him how he managed
to get this done.

2676
02:17:40,378 --> 02:17:42,058
People how to get this...?

2677
02:17:42,083 --> 02:17:43,363
- We'll talk about the detail
- What happened?

2678
02:17:43,488 --> 02:17:47,368
So stay tuned you guys!

2679
02:17:48,038 --> 02:17:49,863
Good evening, Arivu
Welcome to the show

2680
02:17:49,927 --> 02:17:52,727
Waiting for your valuable words!

2681
02:17:52,878 --> 02:17:53,998
Talk

2682
02:17:55,928 --> 02:17:58,008
You must have heard about me by now

2683
02:17:58,134 --> 02:18:00,014
Whatever Mrinalini said was true

2684
02:18:00,126 --> 02:18:02,285
I knew my company manufactured
toxic products.

2685
02:18:02,310 --> 02:18:05,350
And also knew millions of people
consumed them.

2686
02:18:05,375 --> 02:18:07,175
I wanted to put an end to it.

2687
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:09,360
So, I made my own colleagues...

2688
02:18:09,401 --> 02:18:12,761
manufacture quality goods,
under the boss' nose.

2689
02:18:12,948 --> 02:18:14,395
I wanted to bring those samples...

2690
02:18:14,420 --> 02:18:18,060
and prove to the world that,
we could achieve this!

2691
02:18:19,166 --> 02:18:21,886
But I don't have those samples now.

2692
02:18:22,631 --> 02:18:24,151
They burned everything.

2693
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:27,320
Arivu, what are you saying?

2694
02:18:27,345 --> 02:18:30,265
I thought they would have reached
the consumers by now.

2695
02:18:30,290 --> 02:18:33,770
But the sample I'm gonna show
isn't the product's!

2696
02:18:33,886 --> 02:18:38,246
The workers have given me
something even bigger!

2697
02:18:42,807 --> 02:18:44,127
Arivu!

2698
02:18:46,121 --> 02:18:48,401
So far I've listened to my boss

2699
02:18:48,584 --> 02:18:50,584
But the last 2 days, I listened to you.

2700
02:18:50,943 --> 02:18:53,143
When I started work today,...

2701
02:18:53,168 --> 02:18:56,027
I was worried if I would go back
to the old ways.

2702
02:18:56,052 --> 02:18:58,532
I didn't care about the others

2703
02:18:58,751 --> 02:19:01,471
But I wanted to work according to
my conscience!

2704
02:19:01,632 --> 02:19:04,312
I did what was ethical.

2705
02:19:04,337 --> 02:19:06,457
I had peace of mind today.

2706
02:19:06,482 --> 02:19:08,682
It's all because of you Arivu.

2707
02:19:09,717 --> 02:19:11,557
I mixed only 5 bags

2708
02:19:11,582 --> 02:19:13,502
I've made mistakes knowingly

2709
02:19:13,621 --> 02:19:16,301
But I paid my penance the last 2 days.

2710
02:19:16,647 --> 02:19:18,067
I couldn't do any more wrong deeds

2711
02:19:18,130 --> 02:19:19,890
My heart just didn't permit it.

2712
02:19:20,734 --> 02:19:22,894
I could see those kids' faces.

2713
02:19:23,070 --> 02:19:25,030
Would I do this to my own child?

2714
02:19:25,205 --> 02:19:28,165
Today morning my hands shivered...

2715
02:19:28,806 --> 02:19:30,766
when I reached for the sixth bag.

2716
02:19:31,598 --> 02:19:33,278
So I set it aside.

2717
02:19:34,152 --> 02:19:37,790
Expiry dates are advanced by 3 days,
even in today's batch.

2718
02:19:37,825 --> 02:19:39,545
Isn't it a printing mistake?

2719
02:19:39,609 --> 02:19:43,049
I knew all these people would go back
to their old ways.

2720
02:19:43,074 --> 02:19:46,554
So I took the liberty of printing
the expiry dates earlier,...

2721
02:19:46,624 --> 02:19:48,144
...as it would reduce the damage.

2722
02:19:48,169 --> 02:19:51,329
A product that sells for a week,
will only be sold for 3 days.

2723
02:19:51,354 --> 02:19:52,874
What if someone finds out?

2724
02:19:52,899 --> 02:19:55,339
Who cares?
In such a vast process...

2725
02:19:55,364 --> 02:19:57,004
it's impossible to single me out.

2726
02:19:57,029 --> 02:19:59,309
Workers who were dutiful
only towards their job,...

2727
02:19:59,464 --> 02:20:02,544
were now dutiful to the consumers!

2728
02:20:02,678 --> 02:20:04,598
I tested these products

2729
02:20:04,626 --> 02:20:06,223
It was made as per regulations.

2730
02:20:06,248 --> 02:20:07,305
You've done the right thing

2731
02:20:07,330 --> 02:20:08,810
Even you man

2732
02:20:08,896 --> 02:20:10,816
Even Kennedy has done a good job!

2733
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:12,816
Not just these people

2734
02:20:12,934 --> 02:20:16,894
Each member in my company
did their work ethically.

2735
02:20:17,606 --> 02:20:18,966
Someone told me

2736
02:20:18,991 --> 02:20:23,071
That people will always wait for others,
to bring about a change.

2737
02:20:23,330 --> 02:20:25,450
But every change
happens from within,...

2738
02:20:25,475 --> 02:20:27,235
and that's enough to bring
about a revolution!

2739
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:28,876
Today my team is a testimony to that.

2740
02:20:28,901 --> 02:20:31,680
Through marketing, I wanted to showcase
this product as a sample!

2741
02:20:31,705 --> 02:20:34,225
But through their humanity,
they showed a sample of their honesty!

2742
02:20:34,389 --> 02:20:36,229
Workers proved
if they are change themselves

2743
02:20:36,254 --> 02:20:37,399
they can change everything

2744
02:20:37,424 --> 02:20:38,144
Super, bro

2745
02:20:38,169 --> 02:20:40,049
You have made us think!

2746
02:20:40,074 --> 02:20:41,423
We have a caller.

2747
02:20:41,476 --> 02:20:42,516
Hello...tell me sir

2748
02:20:42,541 --> 02:20:44,621
I'm Vinod, Arivu's colleague.

2749
02:20:44,665 --> 02:20:45,625
Tell me brother.

2750
02:20:45,712 --> 02:20:47,992
We thought we were all
doing good, individually

2751
02:20:48,017 --> 02:20:50,217
You have yet again proved us that
it was a collective effort.

2752
02:20:50,242 --> 02:20:52,602
Why are you still being anonymous?

2753
02:20:52,695 --> 02:20:54,641
Tell them it's Saffron.

2754
02:20:54,666 --> 02:20:57,226
What if it becomes a problem to you?

2755
02:20:57,319 --> 02:20:58,423
Why're you scared?

2756
02:20:58,497 --> 02:21:01,217
We've elected an employee as a CEO.

2757
02:21:01,407 --> 02:21:06,243
Nobody know how he will behave
after becoming a boss.

2758
02:21:06,336 --> 02:21:07,416
We won't let it happen.

2759
02:21:07,441 --> 02:21:08,841
He was one of us.

2760
02:21:08,866 --> 02:21:11,026
We'll depose him, the same way
we promoted him!

2761
02:21:11,151 --> 02:21:13,511
You're being too blunt on radio!

2762
02:21:13,536 --> 02:21:14,936
Aadhi will be listening.

2763
02:21:14,961 --> 02:21:16,141
Who gives a damn?

2764
02:21:16,166 --> 02:21:17,235
We aren't doing anything wrong.

2765
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:18,820
Can you hear us?

2766
02:21:19,170 --> 02:21:20,890
Can you hear us loud and clear Aadhi?

2767
02:21:20,915 --> 02:21:22,315
It's all fine.

2768
02:21:22,416 --> 02:21:26,176
But we cheered for him,
when he hiked our salaries.

2769
02:21:26,201 --> 02:21:27,040
True.

2770
02:21:27,065 --> 02:21:30,465
But we no longer fear for our jobs
We are not for sale!

2771
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:33,520
We won't sell out for high incentives!

2772
02:21:33,784 --> 02:21:34,704
Superb bro!

2773
02:21:34,783 --> 02:21:38,503
Only our samples were destroyed

2774
02:21:38,584 --> 02:21:41,224
But I have their honest
products with me.

2775
02:21:41,249 --> 02:21:45,209
We could benefit a
million people today

2776
02:21:45,382 --> 02:21:49,302
Because a thousand workers transformed!

2777
02:21:49,327 --> 02:21:50,927
The millions who are listening,...

2778
02:21:50,952 --> 02:21:52,992
need to realize you're
not just a consumer.

2779
02:21:53,017 --> 02:21:56,097
But basically a worker, from
different walks of life!

2780
02:21:56,176 --> 02:21:57,776
That way we can help billions!

2781
02:21:57,801 --> 02:21:59,921
Your workers have achieved it

2782
02:21:59,977 --> 02:22:02,417
But how can this happen all over?

2783
02:22:02,442 --> 02:22:03,442
We can.

2784
02:22:03,855 --> 02:22:06,215
A politician decides our fate

2785
02:22:06,428 --> 02:22:09,028
But a business man decides
a politician's fate!

2786
02:22:09,100 --> 02:22:13,220
We people are responsible for
their mistakes.

2787
02:22:13,273 --> 02:22:15,907
Work is nothing but labor
in exchange for money.

2788
02:22:16,001 --> 02:22:18,761
But we give something extra

2789
02:22:18,809 --> 02:22:20,089
It's called loyalty!

2790
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:22,547
That's the root cause
of these problems.

2791
02:22:22,572 --> 02:22:24,235
We are exploited in the guise of work...

2792
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:27,740
just because of that damn loyalty!

2793
02:22:28,111 --> 02:22:30,431
The loyalty shown to a bad boss,...

2794
02:22:30,456 --> 02:22:33,416
is akin to betraying a
trusting consumer.

2795
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:36,633
You can even sacrifice your life
for a good boss

2796
02:22:36,658 --> 02:22:40,498
But not to an a*****e!

2797
02:22:40,671 --> 02:22:42,311
So what's the solution?

2798
02:22:42,336 --> 02:22:44,856
We need to break down the
concept of loyalty!

2799
02:22:44,881 --> 02:22:46,601
There's no need for a revolution.

2800
02:22:46,735 --> 02:22:48,555
All it takes is a small opposition.

2801
02:22:48,580 --> 02:22:50,900
My mother taught me that!

2802
02:22:51,071 --> 02:22:52,991
The trials in my company

2803
02:22:53,016 --> 02:22:56,056
Small gestures of mutiny
in the other companies...

2804
02:22:56,283 --> 02:22:57,586
were based on this concept!

2805
02:22:57,611 --> 02:23:02,371
I saw the shock on my boss' face
when their loyalty was shattered!

2806
02:23:02,830 --> 02:23:04,790
You don't have to do anything big;

2807
02:23:04,869 --> 02:23:06,711
Show some opposition.

2808
02:23:06,736 --> 02:23:08,976
If not, start gossiping.

2809
02:23:09,001 --> 02:23:09,977
Gossip?

2810
02:23:10,002 --> 02:23:11,362
You mean gossip?

2811
02:23:11,528 --> 02:23:13,768
I thought you're gonna
say something great!

2812
02:23:13,839 --> 02:23:15,639
You want us to gossip?

2813
02:23:15,664 --> 02:23:16,864
Yes.

2814
02:23:16,889 --> 02:23:19,209
10% of us are innately good.

2815
02:23:19,234 --> 02:23:21,834
The remaining people,
pretend to be good.

2816
02:23:21,859 --> 02:23:24,939
Fearing the consequences.

2817
02:23:25,127 --> 02:23:26,847
Gossip has a special power.

2818
02:23:26,895 --> 02:23:29,535
We're wasting it, by talking
irrelevant things.

2819
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:31,440
When this multi-storied
building collapsed,...

2820
02:23:31,465 --> 02:23:34,110
if at least one worker came forward,
it would have done some good...

2821
02:23:34,135 --> 02:23:35,615
saying it was built reprehensibly.

2822
02:23:35,839 --> 02:23:39,199
People are conned to have C-sections,
while a natural birth is possible.

2823
02:23:39,388 --> 02:23:41,297
At least one nurse could
come forward with the truth.

2824
02:23:41,322 --> 02:23:42,842
Loyalty, my foot!

2825
02:23:43,097 --> 02:23:44,457
Even we are loyalty for them...

2826
02:23:44,523 --> 02:23:47,904
They are monitoring us with CCTVs

2827
02:23:48,894 --> 02:23:52,734
We should also monitor them,
with gossips.

2828
02:23:53,310 --> 02:23:55,578
They won't error if they know
they are being watched!

2829
02:23:55,603 --> 02:23:57,283
Nor will they make us error.

2830
02:23:58,347 --> 02:24:02,258
How ever it is possible,
just gossip.

2831
02:24:02,335 --> 02:24:03,133
Think about it

2832
02:24:03,158 --> 02:24:06,678
You will be scared about the gossip,
if your family member did this

2833
02:24:07,031 --> 02:24:08,591
Our bosses should have the same fear.

2834
02:24:08,616 --> 02:24:11,136
So far, we've beguiled people!

2835
02:24:11,257 --> 02:24:13,937
But from now on,
let's be a whistleblower!

2836
02:24:14,048 --> 02:24:15,448
Let's gossip.

2837
02:24:15,473 --> 02:24:18,233
But business and economy
will take a hit.

2838
02:24:18,258 --> 02:24:21,658
Let's demand boldly that
people want only quality!

2839
02:24:21,975 --> 02:24:24,175
Let them supply for that demand!

2840
02:24:24,564 --> 02:24:25,758
Business will increase.

2841
02:24:25,870 --> 02:24:27,470
Therefore profits will increase too!

2842
02:24:27,495 --> 02:24:28,975
We won't have any crunches.

2843
02:24:29,048 --> 02:24:30,688
If you think you can do it

2844
02:24:30,904 --> 02:24:33,664
If you think we can
bring about a change

2845
02:24:33,879 --> 02:24:37,279
Switch on your lights by midnight!

2846
02:24:40,292 --> 02:24:43,774
If you do it,
it will instill fear.

2847
02:24:43,838 --> 02:24:47,558
And bring more confidence
among our patrons!

2848
02:24:49,391 --> 02:24:52,471
Though there are only a few criminals
they are united!

2849
02:24:52,496 --> 02:24:54,096
So it becomes easy for them.

2850
02:24:54,121 --> 02:24:57,601
But though there are many altruists
we are all scattered.

2851
02:24:58,126 --> 02:25:01,646
Let's show them the power of our unity!

2852
02:25:03,883 --> 02:25:08,610
Even after this, don't be trapped
inside your fear.

2853
02:25:09,210 --> 02:25:10,594
If you switch on your lights

2854
02:25:10,619 --> 02:25:14,339
They won't be able to replace us
even though they fire us!

2855
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:15,586
Let them search...

2856
02:25:15,611 --> 02:25:18,131
for darkness in today's light!

2857
02:25:20,646 --> 02:25:23,446
I don't know how many
of you are listening

2858
02:25:23,797 --> 02:25:26,397
Not sure how many of you will do it.

2859
02:25:26,863 --> 02:25:29,543
But I wanna say one last thing

2860
02:25:29,661 --> 02:25:31,391
I wasn't a fool
but a good worker.

2861
02:25:31,416 --> 02:25:33,136
It took me a month to prove,

2862
02:25:33,775 --> 02:25:36,135
But it'll just take a second for you.

2863
02:25:37,398 --> 02:25:39,878
I believe you will switch on
those lights!

2864
02:25:42,568 --> 02:25:44,488
The most unparallel word...

2865
02:25:44,513 --> 02:25:45,833
is "DEED"!

2866
02:25:47,213 --> 02:25:48,573
Let's do it!

2867
02:26:16,399 --> 02:26:18,439
Bro, it's Kasthuri.

2868
02:26:29,927 --> 02:26:31,287
Why isn't Arivu here?

2869
02:26:32,055 --> 02:26:33,943
That Minalini..

2870
02:26:33,968 --> 02:26:36,048
Amma, her name is Mrinalini

2871
02:26:36,073 --> 02:26:38,233
I couldn't pronounce her name

2872
02:26:38,600 --> 02:26:40,836
Didn't your friends call you?
why didn't you go?

2873
02:26:40,861 --> 02:26:42,861
You didn't even go to our terrace.

2874
02:26:43,406 --> 02:26:44,789
Why're you just lying down?

2875
02:26:44,814 --> 02:26:46,894
Dad, sit down first.

2876
02:26:47,824 --> 02:26:49,344
Are you tensed?

2877
02:26:49,369 --> 02:26:51,449
I've done my part.

2878
02:26:51,687 --> 02:26:53,887
I wanna be with you guys now.

2879
02:27:25,943 --> 02:27:28,063
"Rise up, workers!"

2880
02:27:34,087 --> 02:27:38,127
"Rise up, workers!"

2881
02:27:38,229 --> 02:27:42,349
They have set reminders to
switch on their lights!

2882
02:27:43,592 --> 02:27:44,752
Yes

2883
02:27:50,158 --> 02:27:52,078
"Never cease!"

2884
02:27:53,974 --> 02:27:55,534
"Never fall"

2885
02:27:57,730 --> 02:27:59,210
"Never be..."

2886
02:28:01,590 --> 02:28:03,990
"...voiceless!"

2887
02:28:06,871 --> 02:28:10,664
"Rise up now, workers!"

2888
02:28:10,689 --> 02:28:13,449
"Greatness, will be our work!"

2889
02:28:14,464 --> 02:28:18,384
"Highs and lows don't matter"

2890
02:28:18,409 --> 02:28:21,409
"Change your destiny,
through victory!"

2891
02:28:21,482 --> 02:28:25,122
"Fireball of hard work"

2892
02:28:25,342 --> 02:28:29,180
"You are the world!"

2893
02:28:29,205 --> 02:28:35,914
"The breeze that flows
awaits your command!"

2894
02:28:36,118 --> 02:28:37,438
"Struggle!"

2895
02:28:37,570 --> 02:28:39,410
"Never cease!"

2896
02:28:39,435 --> 02:28:41,275
"Never burn out!"

2897
02:28:41,370 --> 02:28:43,770
"Never fall!"

2898
02:28:43,795 --> 02:28:45,075
"Struggle!"

2899
02:28:45,099 --> 02:28:47,019
"Never heal"

2900
02:28:47,044 --> 02:28:48,964
"Never tire"

2901
02:28:48,989 --> 02:28:51,669
"Never lose!"

2902
02:28:51,694 --> 02:28:53,014
"Struggle!"

2903
02:28:55,440 --> 02:28:56,760
"Fight for it!"

2904
02:28:56,785 --> 02:29:00,385
"Rise up now, workers!"

2905
02:29:00,644 --> 02:29:04,124
"Greatness, will be our work!"

2906
02:29:04,425 --> 02:29:08,145
"Highs and lows don't matter"

2907
02:29:08,193 --> 02:29:11,273
"Change your destiny,
through victory!"

2908
02:29:13,567 --> 02:29:16,687
You didn't tell me the reason
that why you selected me

2909
02:29:26,001 --> 02:29:28,001
"Fight for it!"

2910
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:31,480
"Fight for it!"

2911
02:29:33,861 --> 02:29:35,301
"Fight for it!"

2912
02:29:37,640 --> 02:29:39,040
"Fight for it!"

2913
02:29:57,345 --> 02:30:00,905
"There's nothing impossible
on the face of earth!"

2914
02:30:01,291 --> 02:30:05,131
"Rise up,
like a storm!"

2915
02:30:05,156 --> 02:30:08,876
"Not knowing our strengths;
scared and subservient were we!"

2916
02:30:08,901 --> 02:30:12,541
"Rise up, to the top!"

2917
02:30:12,566 --> 02:30:16,286
"Make use of this one life"

2918
02:30:16,311 --> 02:30:20,391
"To impart meaning for others!"

2919
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:23,856
"Workers should rewrite history"

2920
02:30:23,881 --> 02:30:28,881
"The hand that feeds
should never starve!"

2921
02:30:28,906 --> 02:30:30,746
"Never cease"

2922
02:30:30,771 --> 02:30:32,571
"Never burn out!"

2923
02:30:32,596 --> 02:30:35,196
"Never fall"

2924
02:30:35,221 --> 02:30:36,461
"Fight for it!"

2925
02:30:36,486 --> 02:30:38,006
"Never heal"

2926
02:30:38,353 --> 02:30:40,393
"Never tire"

2927
02:30:40,418 --> 02:30:42,618
"Never lose!"

2928
02:30:42,643 --> 02:30:43,683
"Fight for it!"

2929
02:30:43,785 --> 02:30:45,385
Nobody errors by choice

2930
02:30:45,783 --> 02:30:47,503
They do it because it's success!

2931
02:30:47,567 --> 02:30:49,447
All we have to do, is show them;
that goodness wins ultimately!

2932
02:30:49,473 --> 02:30:50,993
They will start doing it by choice!

2933
02:30:51,018 --> 02:30:53,338
This attempt is a marketing by itself!

2934
02:30:53,479 --> 02:30:55,279
To illustrate, that virtues can triumph!
