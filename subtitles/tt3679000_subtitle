1
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,234
Good evening India!

2
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,575
From Mumbai to Manipur...

3
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,706
Delhi to Dimapur...

4
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,444
roads wear a deserted look
all over the country.

5
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,383
People have taken
the day off from work.

6
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,081
Everyone has eagerly
tuned their TV sets

7
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,180
to this amazing dance show
Hum Kisise Kum Nahin!

8
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,522
And everyone is waiting to watch
their favourite team

9
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,426
from Mumbafs Nalasopara -
Mumbai Stunners!

10
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,055
Cockroach! Cockroach! Cockroach!

11
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,262
Quiet! Lizards...

12
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:10,135
I am Raghavs uncle... Raghavji.

13
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,368
L-le is my 'original',
'full time' nephew.

14
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,707
When he was little, he used to
lie down and dance.

15
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,751
I would ask him,
'Son, what are you doing?'

16
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,645
He would say, ‘Uncle, I am dancing

17
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,312
like a fish.'

18
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,321
'Fish dance!'

19
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,182
Vernon! What can I say about him?

20
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,521
He makes everyone laugh.

21
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,290
L-le says,
'anybody can deliver a pizza.'

22
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,558
<i>'But</i> a <i>smile...
if you can deliver that...</i>

23
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,462
it's an accomplishment.‘

24
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,296
Vernon, keep up the good work!

25
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,131
Vernon, we love you!

26
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,261
All the best!
- Keep it up!

27
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,799
Vinnie! She is very cool...

28
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,232
Not only is her style cool...

29
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,535
she is a cool person too.

30
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,769
She is coming on television,
which is why

31
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,170
she hasn't come to work.

32
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,406
But her clients are
waiting only for her.

33
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,773
Suru! We call him Suru here.

34
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:50,538
It's his nickname.

35
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,106
The boys call him that.

36
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,277
So I told him that he should do

37
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,550
whatever his heart is set on.

38
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,353
'Move ahead in life.
I will support you.

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,723
I will give you as much money
as you want.'

40
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,014
Hey, Suru! You aren't ready as yet?

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,286
Pass me that.

42
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,758
Here. Now hurry up.

43
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,160
And is there anything to eat?
I am starving.

44
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,459
Yes, there is an apple inside.

45
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,158
Has everyone reached?

46
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,223
Everyone is there.

47
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,394
What!

48
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,302
Vinnie is waiting for you downstairs.
Get dressed quickly.

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,430
Hey!

50
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,635
Before we begin the biggest
dance celebration...

51
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,337
Let me introduce ourjudges.

52
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,607
Ladies and gentlemen!

53
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,807
Please welcome...

54
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,674
Mrs. Sita Devi ji...

55
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,446
Terrence Lewis...

56
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,078
And Remo D'Souza!

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,662
Welcome to the biggest
dance show in India

58
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,198
‘Adiction Deo‘ presents...

59
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:19,067
‘Hum Kisise Kum Nahin‘
powered by Reliance Trends.

60
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:23,006
that is being watched since 12 weeks
in 180 countries by millions.

61
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,667
Let's start this programme

62
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,439
with a breathtaking and
mind blowing performance...

63
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,503
from Team Illuminati

64
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,571
And the next group <i>is...</i>

65
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,172
J5!

66
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,026
Where were you guys!

67
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,117
Sorry... Come on boys!

68
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,560
We have to win this!

69
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,064
Let's go for it!!

70
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,497
We have a team here...

71
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,501
and every time they
performs on this stage...

72
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:15,097
they makes us realize that Indian
dancers are no less than anyone!

73
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:20,008
- And we have here your favourite team
- Mumbai Stunners!

74
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:19,588
- Wow! What a performancel!

75
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,258
- The audience has already given
them a standing ovation.

76
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,165
- But, let's see
what the judges have to say.

77
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,330
- So, let's hear it for
Mumbai Stunners.

78
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:34,201
Yes. The audience has given you
a standing ovation

79
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,341
- Yes, absolutely!

80
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,439
But for this amazing act...

81
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,345
I have to congratulate...

82
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,147
that awesome team whose name is...

83
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,816
Philippine All Stars!

84
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,452
Why Suresh,
will you say it or should l?

85
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,627
I think I will say it.

86
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:58,496
This entire act, its every step...

87
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:03,003
from the formation to the flip...

88
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,331
has been copied!

89
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,372
What do you have to say, Suresh?

90
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,136
No, sir. We have not copied the act.

91
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,010
Shut up!

92
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,580
Not just copy, but your team
has also cheated.

93
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,553
You have written that the act is
choreographed by Suresh and Vernon.

94
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,746
But it's not even your choreography!

95
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,288
The problem with people like you
is that you pick someone e
se's ideas

96
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,555
and creativity from the internet...

97
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,221
copy it and perform the act on stage.

98
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,765
and the poor souls who do not know...

99
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,261
that you have copied the act...

100
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,360
applaud and vote for you.
Correct?

101
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,127
Very sad!

102
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:39,301
- Suresh, aren't you
Padmashri DurgadevFs son?

103
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,335
Yes, madam.

104
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,474
- Whether anyone else
knows this or not...

105
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:53,389
but we believe that you understand
very clearly that dance is no joke.

106
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:57,128
It is worship. It is a discipline...

107
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,224
A discipline your mother lived by.

108
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:05,298
I cannot believe that you
can do something like this.

109
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:13,037
Your mother, who died with
her anklets on...

110
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,176
for whom dance was everything.

111
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,711
Shame on you!

112
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:25,179
I think you cannot continue
in the competition.

113
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,715
You guys can leave.
- Tell them we didn't cheat.

114
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,758
Sir!

115
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,588
Think original next time.
You may go.

116
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,123
Suru...

117
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:43,233
In summery breeze, flows the colour

118
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:48,041
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

119
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:53,746
In summery breeze, flows the colour

120
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:58,721
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

121
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,691
The colour of your tradition

122
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,422
The colour of your love

123
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:09,729
It has brought the
colour of your success

124
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,526
The colour of your tradition

125
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,163
The colour of your love

126
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:20,405
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

127
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,507
<i>'</i> Hi!

128
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,581
Hi! Vinnie, I need a new haircut.
Will you manage a Katrina Kaif?

129
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,674
An exact copy.

130
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,784
Who am I asking?

131
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,380
You are an expert at copying,
isn't it?

132
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:37,087
Oh Mother...

133
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,799
My Mother...

134
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,701
Did your father build this place
so that you could dance?

135
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,399
Enough!

136
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,738
No more dancing from today.

137
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,772
From now on, you will
concentrate on work.

138
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,515
We've had to face the music as well.

139
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,573
What happened?
- We are also answerable to our families...

140
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,175
What's wrong?

141
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,617
I won't be a part
of this group anymore!

142
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,619
Tell me, what happened?

143
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:04,644
What is it?

144
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:05,587
No more, Suru.
I'm sorry...

145
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,124
Why don't you tell us what happened?

146
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,454
Why are you going out?

147
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,254
Where are you going?

148
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,517
What's the problem, boys?

149
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,266
- Pizza, sir.

150
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,735
Good evening, sir.
- Good evening...

151
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,231
Ah, so the pizza is free today?

152
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:24,604
Why would it be free, sir?

153
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,642
Because it's late.

154
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,704
No sir, it's just 25 minutes
by my watch.

155
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:29,746
Really?

156
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,745
But according to my watch
it's 35 minutes.

157
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,083
But sir, the delivery time...

158
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:35,744
This is wrong, sir.

159
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,715
Yes, yes! Go.

160
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,718
Sir, this is cheating.

161
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,090
And now you will teach me
what cheating is!

162
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,689
You guys are the biggest cheaters.

163
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,157
Listen, I will order pizza everyday.

164
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,531
And if YOU deliver it...
I will not pay a penny. Got it?

165
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,594
You can do whatever you want.
Get out.

166
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:55,569
Cheaters!

167
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,641
- Did you deliver late again?

168
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:58,437
Sorry, sir.

169
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,978
I explained it to you earlier.
What do you mean by sorry?

170
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,339
Does money grow on trees? Does it?
- No, sir.

171
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,149
- This is a last warning.

172
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,482
- Next time I will cut it
from your salary.

173
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,512
Oh Mother

174
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,525
Dear Mother

175
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,618
Hey, cheater.

176
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,356
Sorry... waiter!
Come here.

177
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,259
Vinnie, it's your client.

178
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,426
Come in.
- Coming.

179
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,169
My shadow dithers away from me

180
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,468
Please get me another one.
- Okay.

181
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,504
Go!

182
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:42,415
My shadow is your illusion

183
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:47,322
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

184
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:53,163
In summery breeze, flows the colour

185
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:58,396
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

186
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,098
The colour of your tradition

187
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,606
The colour of your love

188
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:09,136
It has brought the
colour of your success

189
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,739
The colour of your tradition

190
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,450
The colour of your love

191
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:19,252
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

192
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:26,221
In summery breeze, flows the colour
Fluttering in your warmth and affection

193
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,232
"This entire act, its every step..."

194
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,128
"from the formation to the flip..."

195
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,367
"has been copied!"

196
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:39,604
"- Your mother, who died with
her anklets on..."

197
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,545
"for whom dance was everything.
Shame on you!"

198
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:55,348
I have shamed you

199
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,452
I agree I have tarnished
your reputation

200
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,520
Mother

201
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,131
My mother

202
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,238
I have shamed you

203
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,669
Mother

204
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,278
My mother

205
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,754
You are in my soul,
In my every word

206
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,689
My stubbornness, my life

207
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,628
You are my deepest pain,
My ultimate consequence

208
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,030
You are my holy recitation

209
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,276
You are in my soul,
In my every word

210
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,242
My stubbornness, my life

211
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,177
You are my deepest pain,
My ultimate consequence

212
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,112
You are my holy recitation

213
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,013
You are in my prayer,
You are my hope

214
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,018
You are my path

215
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,678
You are my honour,
The blood in my veins

216
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,245
You are my all, my life

217
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:04,193
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

218
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:12,265
In summery breeze, flows the colour

219
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:17,172
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

220
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,690
Thank you!
Welcome to Comedy Nights.

221
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,159
Let me tell you...

222
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,025
if cheating was
included in the Olympics

223
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,395
Mumbai Stunners would surely win Gold.

224
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,762
Bigger cheaters than us!

225
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,195
I gave him an 80-rupee note
and requested for change.

226
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,668
He gave me two 40-rupee notes.

227
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,368
Stop! Senses transformed
Sights varied

228
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,106
And the boat changed
Altering the coast.

229
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:00,374
If you want to change this world,
You need to change your perspective.

230
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:06,151
What you want is neither
in your retreat Nor in your e><i
e.

231
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:10,388
Introspect.
Everything is in your belief.

232
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:19,628
A stone faced hardship
And shattered to pebbles.

233
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:24,300
While another stone bore adversity
To become the seat of the Lord.

234
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,050
Hello Vinnie...

235
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:34,982
Suru.

236
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,143
Let's prepare a super performance.

237
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,712
We will rock the stage ne><t year.
Why are you worrying?

238
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,051
Next year is very far.
I have a solution right now.

239
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:43,684
What is it?

240
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,165
What is this?

241
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,327
The biggest hip-hop competition
is going to be held in Vegas.

242
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,600
You mean in America?
l-low will we go there'?

243
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,269
What did the judges say?

244
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,205
That we copied those guys!

245
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,336
I say let's go there and
take them head on.

246
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,674
- What rubbish!

247
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,078
We haven't managed
to do anything here.

248
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,615
What can we achieve there?

249
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,417
Suru is fully prepared.

250
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,777
The competition is in three months.

251
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,723
We will start a new team.

252
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,186
India's first dance team.

253
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,485
What are you saying, Suru!

254
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,496
In three months! Are you crazy?

255
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,690
You are being unrealistic!

256
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,597
In three months we'll make a team...
Go to America...

257
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:28,730
Look, if you guys support me...
I am sure we can get there.

258
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,102
And if you don't support me...

259
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:37,772
I will take some time
but I will surely make a team.

260
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,317
Let's go.

261
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:50,811
Vishnu! Vishnu! Vishnu!....

262
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,614
Get lost, you fool!

263
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,486
Dude, who are you?

264
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,547
Idiot!

265
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,022
He is asking me who I am?

266
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,762
Should I tell him or show him?

267
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,259
Show him!

268
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:14,409
I have spent
The whole day waiting

269
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:19,712
Every happiness is borrowed

270
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:24,781
Even my sorrows
Are one on one free

271
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:29,784
I was here yesterday
Am here today too

272
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:35,055
And will meet you tomorrow, too
Right here

273
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:41,035
O O O At happy hour!

274
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:45,539
O O O At happy hour!

275
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:51,276
All the worries will drown
In the first go!

276
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:55,752
O O O At happy hour!

277
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,551
O O O At happy hour!

278
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,145
The heart jumps with Joy!

279
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,683
The glass is empty
Pour!

280
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,756
The heart is stubborn

281
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,290
It doesn't listen to me

282
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,761
No boundaries to its stubbornness

283
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,693
It doesn't listen to me

284
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,530
There is no one like me

285
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,763
There's one and only me!

286
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:52,264
There is a lightening in my veins

287
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:57,173
Like a current passes through wire

288
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:03,416
One, two, three, four
At happy hour!

289
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:08,056
O O O At happy hour!

290
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:13,629
All the worries will drown
In the first go!

291
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:18,567
O O O At happy hour!

292
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:23,269
O O O At happy hour!

293
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,583
Bring out the naughtiness
Knock on the locks and doors

294
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:47,722
You are a bird, but break the cage
With the fury of your wings.

295
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,324
Smashed your slippers on the rug
The needle was lost in the haystack

296
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:54,496
But why did you run?
Don't let fear hold you!

297
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,736
C) Mr. Naidu!
The Lord is inside you!

298
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,401
Be thick-skinned
Live life on the rocks

299
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,378
Gulp down La-la-life!

300
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:06,175
O O O At happy hour!

301
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:10,014
O O O At happy hour!

302
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:21,722
Sir!

303
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,161
This is the last one. Please.

304
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,298
Sir, you are superb!

305
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,464
Outstanding! Hats off to you, sir!

306
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,405
I know, man.
Shut up and get lost!

307
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:33,772
Sorry, sir.

308
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:36,669
Here, hold this.

309
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:37,770
Wait and watch...

310
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,283
One day we will go to America

311
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,148
for the hip-hop competition

312
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,014
and people like him will salute us.

313
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,021
What will they do?

314
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:47,052
Salute.

315
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,523
I know, man. Get lost.

316
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,256
Don't ever meet me again.

317
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,521
Go away, hippopotamus.

318
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,293
- All my money is over.

319
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:57,129
Sir, excuse me...

320
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:58,463
Excuse me.

321
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,561
I have won the bottle.
I don't want a bill.

322
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,003
Yes, you have won the bottle.

323
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,371
Yes, so let me drink.

324
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,636
Yes, sir. Drink up.

325
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,234
But you mentioned
the hip-hop competition in America.

326
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,507
Ah, yes. In Las Vegas.

327
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,010
Yes, sir.

328
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,982
Have you gone there?

329
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:15,742
I wanted to.

330
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:23,421
But right now I will go home.

331
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,993
I can drop you.
I have a bike.

332
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,496
Take me.

333
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:30,659
Yes, sir.

334
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,631
Take me.

335
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,313
By the way, sir, we've met
like in the movies.

336
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,244
I mean you dance like Michael Jackson

337
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,149
and have adopted
Indian superstar Rajni's style.

338
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,118
<i>D0 you agree?</i>

339
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,245
Left.

340
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:57,153
I didn't tell you earlier
but I have an entire team ready.

341
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,360
Right.

342
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:01,364
Right from here?
Actually, sir, even I am a dancer.

343
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,367
You may have seen me on television.
Do you watch television, sir?

344
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,561
Left.
- You left TV?

345
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,571
Anyway, I really feel
that we met by fate.

346
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:13,667
I mean, we needed a choreographer
and you, a team. You know like...

347
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,143
Right.

348
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,310
Okay, sir.

349
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,247
Yes, sir. I was saying...
will you teach us, sir?

350
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,078
Right.

351
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,174
Yes, sir, right.

352
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,187
So, will you take us to Vegas?
Tell me, sir.

353
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,483
Stop.

354
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,453
Sir. Vegas.

355
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,524
Vishnu sir! Vishnu sir...

356
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,398
At happy hour...

357
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:38,633
l-low was my dance'?

358
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:39,668
Sir, superb!

359
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,068
I know, man. Shut up!

360
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,097
He must be sleeping, isn't it?

361
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:48,739
Try again.

362
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,740
L-low can you trust someone
when they are drunk'?

363
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,611
L-low do you know
if he was saying the truth'?

364
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,346
He knows.

365
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,513
He said that this is an annual
international event since years

366
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,353
Suru, it has been years
since we have been knocking.

367
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,517
When will he open the door?

368
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,958
Shut up!

369
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,628
It is the door of fortune.
It will not open easily.

370
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,565
This door isn't leading to luck,
but a tippler.

371
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,503
- Hey, the door opened!

372
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,202
Come... come...
Be careful... inside.

373
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,399
Sir.

374
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,273
Sir?

375
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,171
Come... come...

376
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:26,113
Sir?

377
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,479
Vishnu sir.
- Vernon, check these sticky notes.

378
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:34,517
OMG!
- Not notes, but a whole project.

379
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,423
International hip-hop competition.

380
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,688
Whoa!

381
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,391
He's mapped out everything
about the competition.

382
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:48,094
Looks like he's all set to conquer...

383
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,567
The entire mission is ready.

384
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:52,575
From travel details
to the hotel rental.

385
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:57,377
I told you. He may be a loony tippler
but he is everyone's guru.

386
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,541
But where is this guru?

387
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,283
Quiet.

388
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,417
Come on.

389
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:05,321
Come on.

390
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:11,721
Vishnu sir.

391
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,520
Sir. Sir.

392
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,730
Shake him.

393
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:16,455
Sir.

394
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:18,724
Who is it?

395
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:19,969
Hi, sir.

396
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,169
Who are you, man?

397
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:26,636
Sir, this is Vernon, Raghav, Jack...
I am Vinnie and he's Suresh.

398
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,975
Sir, you were tipsy last night.
Then I paid your bill.

399
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,515
Then on the bike -
right, left, right, left...

400
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,114
Stop.
- Yes, you told me to stop like that.

401
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,117
Have you come here to get the money?

402
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,175
Sir, not money.

403
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,018
You spoke about the international
hip-hop competition.

404
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,226
Sir, you told me you would show me
the road to Vegas.

405
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,495
The road to Vegas!

406
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,001
Get out of here, go straight,
then take a left.

407
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,161
Take a taxi from the main road
to the airport.

408
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:54,532
Go... get lost!

409
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,695
What do you mean?

410
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:56,762
Get lost!

411
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,634
Sir, you promised.

412
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:03,669
Sir, you said that you need a group
and that group is here today.

413
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,237
I swear he said it.

414
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,408
Suru!

415
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,711
Vinnie, say something.

416
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:14,714
Sir, we all need a choreographer...
a mentor like you.

417
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:16,449
Sir, please.

418
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,320
I told you to leave.

419
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,421
Forget being a mentor.
Look at the bottle he's picked up.

420
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,023
I do not want a team.
- Sir!

421
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:24,726
Sir!

422
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,767
Sir, you are kidding, aren't you?
- Maybe.

423
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,044
Look at my face...

424
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:38,704
Bubbles!

425
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,610
Do you think I'm joking?

426
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,254
No more teaching...

427
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,793
Sir, have you stopped teaching dance?

428
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,554
Sir, didn't you mention
the other day...

429
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:56,656
Sir?

430
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,726
you had prepared for the competition.

431
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,505
And that you didn't have a team

432
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,303
You wanted to go to Vegas.

433
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,604
Are you crazy?

434
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,082
Whatever you may say...
he's a genius.

435
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:23,322
Did you see that board?
He is completely prepared.

436
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:27,360
Suru, is this tippler
a dancer as well?

437
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,098
Dancer?

438
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,031
He's the king of dancers.

439
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,091
He is excellent.

440
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,095
I cannot tell you...

441
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,430
He's outstanding...

442
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,736
I mean... he's... he's just...

443
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,676
He's praising someone else
for the first time!

444
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:43,477
This is unbelievable.

445
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:46,448
It will be unbelievable when our feet
dance to his steps.

446
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,484
If anyone can get
back our lost honour...

447
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,447
it is Vishnu sir!

448
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,047
What sort of a loony guy is he?
He drinks shampoo.

449
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,485
He must be downing conditioner.

450
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,455
And honour...
We will get it back when he agrees.

451
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,292
He will agree.
Leave that to me.

452
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:01,262
Done.

453
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:04,761
Suru...
- Yes?

454
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,301
Listen...

455
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,029
You always make some grand plan,

456
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,374
everyone gets excited and
leave their work and come to you.

457
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:17,138
But you...
- But what, Vinnie?

458
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,480
I am scared.

459
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,015
What if there is a problem
like the last time?

460
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,110
There won't be.

461
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,586
Do you trust me?

462
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,314
Do you?

463
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:30,649
Obviously.

464
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,194
- Come on guys...

465
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:40,092
Are you angry?
- Yes, sir.

466
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:53,782
L-low was my dance that clay'?

467
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:54,483
Sir, superb.

468
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,382
Shut up! I know, man.

469
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,183
Sir. Have it.

470
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,764
Sir, Vegas. Come on, sir.
Please.

471
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,698
What kind of guy is this?

472
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,630
What are you doing?

473
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:15,694
Oh, no!

474
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,239
What are you doing? No!

475
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:18,764
No... no!

476
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,273
Sir, the pizza is free.
- Get lost.

477
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,685
Wow! Wow! Wow!

478
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:40,285
Turn now.

479
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,065
What are you doing, sir?

480
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,442
I'm trying to ride the bike.
Sir, please.

481
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:07,580
"Get us a beverage."

482
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:09,083
Sir.

483
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:10,319
Please give us one chance.
We have a good team.

484
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,292
No chance!

485
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,293
Please agree, sir.

486
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,455
Sir, we want to represent India.
Give us one chance.

487
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,190
- Get lost!

488
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,493
Sir, Vegas.
- Get lost!

489
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,557
We love dancing. Please sir...
give us one chance.

490
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,000
- Get lost!

491
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,329
Sir, I have a plan.

492
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,304
I have told you so many times.

493
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,568
I can't teach you to dance. Get lost!

494
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,010
You okay?

495
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,148
Sir, what is this?

496
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,583
We are pleading so much.

497
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,217
Can you not see our hard work?

498
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,726
Can't you see Suru's efforts?

499
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:47,286
Vinnie, let's go.
- No please let me...

500
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,360
Suru has only one dream...

501
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,134
And he is waiting for the moment
you will agree.

502
00:34:55,227 --> 00:34:56,797
And you are pushing him away?

503
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:01,301
Why are you behaving this way, sir?
Vvhy?

504
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:05,612
Because you are all cheaters.

505
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,412
All of you.

506
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,579
You stole the Philippine All Stars'
entire routine...

507
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:14,419
in Hum Kisi Se Kam Nahin.

508
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,480
step by step!

509
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,351
The entire country saw it.

510
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,657
I recognized you immediately.

511
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,063
I didn't tell you though. Out!

512
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,201
Come on boys.

513
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,544
Sir, the world gave up on us...

514
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,274
but I thought you would
give us a chance.

515
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,376
Fine. We are cheaters.

516
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:45,420
But do you know who
the biggest cheater is here?

517
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,188
Sir, it is you.

518
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:50,584
We are only tricking the world.

519
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,586
But you are cheating yourself.

520
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:56,756
Your entire wall is covered
with these posters...

521
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:59,200
Have your dreams come true yet?

522
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,266
I thought that like us...
you too love dance.

523
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,974
But you are only...

524
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,235
Come on. Let's go.

525
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,037
It is not so easy to go to Vegas.

526
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:13,279
First, there will be
auditions in Bangalore.

527
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,681
Sir, we know the details.

528
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,112
The travel,
food and competition fee...

529
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,583
adds up to about
24-25 thousand rupees...

530
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,124
Sir, everything is arranged for.

531
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,451
Even the team is very good.
At least check us out once.

532
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,426
24, 25 thousand rupees
will not suffice.

533
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:28,396
Do you know the cost
of going to Vegas?

534
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,599
Twenty two lakhs sixty thousand.

535
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:34,696
Sir, if we win the
Bangalore competition...

536
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,534
even that amount will be arranged.

537
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,497
My boss, Shetty Anna...

538
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,735
who owns Desi Cocktail Bar...

539
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,167
will sponsor us.

540
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:43,406
He promised us.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:44,469
Please sir.
- Please.

542
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:46,207
Only you need to agree.

543
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,450
Say yes, sir...

544
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:50,780
Say yes...

545
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:54,552
Sir... sir...

546
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,024
- Please sir.

547
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,423
Yes!

548
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,393
Move aside. Our guru has come!

549
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:16,570
- Chotu get us tea.
- On Raghavs account.

550
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,318
WOW !

551
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:27,013
You guys practice here?

552
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,217
Yes, sir. Since we were kids.

553
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,684
It's Crooks' place.

554
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,594
Half Of it.

555
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,297
Half?

556
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,726
Father and uncle were partners.

557
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:42,034
After father's death,
I became the owner.

558
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:45,208
Crocks has cut a super deal
with his uncle.

559
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,606
Uncle continues his business outside

560
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,234
while we rehearse here every day.

561
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,608
Sir, my deal.

562
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:50,669
Yes. His deal.

563
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,579
Alright. Call the rest.

564
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,376
Sir...uh...

565
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,448
Sir... We are only so many.

566
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,252
Sir... Please sit.

567
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:09,362
The championships main event
is the group event.

568
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,296
Our team is small.

569
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:12,494
It's not enough.

570
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,436
We will need more people.

571
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,233
Sir... don't even go there.

572
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,104
We have been completely defamed.

573
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,274
Sir, after the HK2N competition we...

574
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,442
Sir... It is because of him...
that half of them left...

575
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,639
Because of me...

576
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:25,977
Guys!

577
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:26,981
Quiet...

578
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:27,709
Guys, please stop it!

579
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,518
Please.
- Sorry, sir.

580
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:31,247
We don't need a fight.

581
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,489
We need a solution to this problem.

582
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,150
Tell me one by one.

583
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,120
The one holding the flag will talk.

584
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,189
Right, sir.
- Talk.

585
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,591
The old dancers will not come back

586
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:46,728
so we will need new dancers.

587
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,061
- And sir, there is one...

588
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,233
He has the flag.

589
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,066
We will have to hold an audition
for new dancers.

590
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,338
and for that we will have to
post it to Facebook.

591
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,276
And also make posters.

592
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,404
And, Orkut.

593
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:59,115
Sir, I know Bhogi.

594
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,080
mag-

595
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:03,046
Oh, sorry. I know Bhogi.

596
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,280
He is the best guy for posters.
- I have...

597
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,253
The posters won't be a concern.

598
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:08,714
You have a lot to say, buddy. Talk.

599
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,017
And, sir...

600
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,420
Yes, talk.
- Talk.

601
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:14,622
Victory to India, sir.

602
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,290
Sir, he's weird like this.

603
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,129
Sorry, sir...

604
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,194
Sorry, sir...

605
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:22,563
What's up boys?

606
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,104
Suru, sit.

607
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:26,637
Listen up. I am starting a new team

608
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,976
for the international
hip-hop challenge.

609
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,002
That means a team for India.
Our team!

610
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,645
I have reserved a spot for you guys.

611
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,515
Come on, boys. Let's go.

612
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:35,516
Yes.

613
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:38,520
Take him. He anyway loves to cheat.

614
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,557
International !!

615
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:00,430
Bhogi's poster isn't working.

616
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:01,334
I don't think anyone
else is going to come.

617
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,735
He's going to drive us nuts.

618
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:03,995
The poster is jinxed.

619
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:04,767
Brothers...

620
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:05,769
- Hey... sorry!

621
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,473
Hey!

622
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:08,237
- Where do you think you are going?

623
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,575
ls the audition happening here?
- Yes...

624
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:11,739
And who are you?

625
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,574
From Baroda to Naroda,
I'm very famous.

626
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:15,744
- Here's another weirdo.

627
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,514
'D' stands for Dharmesh.

628
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,452
Sir. Vishnu sir. l-low are you'?

629
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,013
Alright.

630
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,026
I saw on Facebook that sir is

631
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,618
putting together a new team...

632
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,388
Which is why I am here.

633
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:29,557
Do you know Vishnu sir?

634
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,792
Of course.

635
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,335
He danced so well in Baroda.

636
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:34,597
That's when I started dancing.

637
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,036
Show us your moves.

638
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,402
Let me tell you.

639
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:38,600
My father is in the police force.

640
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:39,641
He asked me to join the police.

641
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:40,698
$0, go join!

642
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,712
I don't know anything
else besides dance.

643
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,347
So, I am here. As a patriot.

644
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:47,712
Hey, patriot.

645
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,649
Will keep talking
or show us your moves?

646
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,345
I will. I am here for that.

647
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,217
Madam.

648
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:54,257
- She'll come.
- Hurry up.

649
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,314
Come on! Hit it!

650
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,061
Oh! Goggles.

651
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,143
Superb!

652
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,642
Thanks guys.
- It was superb buddy!

653
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,614
What a mind blowing performance.

654
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,586
He is a very good dancer.

655
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:32,680
He will add to the group, sir.

656
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:35,020
Sir. He is too good.
- Yes, sir!

657
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:36,657
Sir.

658
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,023
Good dancer!
- Thank you, sir.

659
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,495
We need more like him.

660
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,156
Do you need another dancer?

661
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,632
Yes
- I have a fantastic dancer.

662
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:46,066
I will bring him if you say so.

663
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,162
Yes of course.

664
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,199
Yes.

665
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,536
Sir, am I in the team?

666
00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,383
Isn't this a great place, Vinod?

667
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:07,713
What's up, D?

668
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,050
Sir, this is Vinod.

669
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,593
He's the other dancer
that I mentioned.

670
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,559
He's the guy.

671
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,554
Hi, Vinod. lam Vishnu.

672
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:15,757
Sir, he is mute and hearing impaired.
- Hi!

673
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,397
What?

674
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,001
D, what are you saying?

675
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:21,298
Yes... it's true.

676
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,269
Sir, he is mute and hearing impaired.

677
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,136
In our words,
he doesn't speaker nor a mike.

678
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:27,369
If he cannot hear...
how will he dance to the beat'?

679
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:28,274
One chance.

680
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,403
Sorry, but we need a dancer.

681
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:32,037
All this will not do.

682
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:33,639
Sir, just watch him once.

683
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,047
He will manage.

684
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,421
Sir, he is saying
that he wants to dance.

685
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,420
I can dance...

686
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,224
...so what if I cannot hear the music.

687
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:49,791
But, sir.

688
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,394
He says that he can...

689
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:56,633
feel the music.

690
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,107
If you can...

691
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,510
feel the music...

692
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,411
then...

693
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:13,322
Any Body Can Dance.

694
00:47:06,591 --> 00:47:08,628
- Sir, he's very good.
- We could take him.

695
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,639
- We maybe be in trouble if we take him.
- Boys!

696
00:47:11,596 --> 00:47:13,633
Are you still discussing Vinod?

697
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:15,700
He dances better than all of us.

698
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,377
Yes.

699
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:17,674
We will have to take him, sir.
What say?

700
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:19,339
We will have to take him.

701
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,349
Guys! Don't mind but he is
like a live version of a silent film.

702
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,406
He is a film without a soundtrack.

703
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:23,645
L-low long will we tolerate it'?

704
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:26,018
Look, it is fine till this point.

705
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,647
If anything gets messed up
in the big competition...

706
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:30,386
then he will not
take any responsibility.

707
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:31,153
What will we do then?

708
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,489
Why are you being negative?
- Why are you saying that?

709
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,654
Then who will take responsibility?

710
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:34,458
I Will.

711
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,430
In that case so will I.

712
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:37,194
Me, too.

713
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:37,665
I am in, boss.

714
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:38,598
That's it, Jacky boy.

715
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:40,192
Sir, give us your final decision.

716
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:41,629
- He is already in.

717
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,432
<i>Yaw.!</i>

718
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:49,073
five... six... seven... eight.

719
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:49,736
One... two...

720
00:47:50,001 --> 00:47:50,775
three... four...

721
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,343
five... six... seven... eight.

722
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,212
- What were you saying?
- This one...

723
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:57,515
- Vernon, let's try that step.
- No, this one.

724
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:58,713
- ls this the one?

725
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,585
ls there place in the team?

726
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,424
There was always place for you guys.

727
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,461
- It's good you guys are back.

728
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,604
Thank you, lord!

729
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,609
Get me the deodorant.

730
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,551
Get him out of here.

731
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:08,053
What's wrong?
- What a shameless guy!

732
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,118
Well done, boys!

733
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,455
Sir, let's do it once more.

734
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,289
Take rest.

735
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,350
Sir, please...

736
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,259
Hey, Vinnie!

737
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,956
Come on guys...

738
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,030
Once more...
- No more... enough...

739
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,299
- What's wrong with you guys?

740
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:26,700
Sit.

741
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,065
I'm not coming.

742
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,236
L-low much will we practice'?
- Relax.

743
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,007
Come.
Or I'm going to dance on my own.

744
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:32,672
You go dance with her.

745
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,543
Go on.

746
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,160
Listen, my love

747
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:53,658
Pour the ink of love on me

748
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:03,505
I will take on the colour

749
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:08,115
I will rain on you

750
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:14,587
I am only yours

751
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:20,129
Your touch makes me come alive

752
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:24,690
Come alive

753
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,351
Superb!
- It's not over yet.

754
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:55,522
Wait!

755
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,531
I'm not practicing...
- You are going nowhere!

756
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,790
Hold on, D.

757
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,468
Suru, watch this.

758
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:06,336
I am like sand

759
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:09,571
You are the source for water

760
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:16,676
You complete me

761
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,518
I am like sand

762
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:23,753
You are the source for water

763
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:29,293
You complete me

764
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:37,166
I will cross the ocean

765
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:40,266
With this love of yours

766
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:44,108
I will blossom

767
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:48,514
I am only yours

768
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,316
Your touch makes me come alive

769
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:57,723
Come alive

770
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:06,298
Listen, my love

771
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:13,775
Pour the ink of love on me

772
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:21,745
The Bangalore audition money?

773
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,251
Wait. I will also give you.

774
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,550
Why?

775
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,753
You have my share?
Who gave it to you?

776
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:37,525
Boyfriend?

777
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,433
Who is my boyfriend?

778
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:46,734
<i>Sum?</i>

779
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,777
Who told you?

780
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:55,649
I am mute and hearing impaired.
lam not blind.

781
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,347
You are seeing a bit too much.

782
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,156
Five... six... seven... eight...

783
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,454
Turn around!

784
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,602
There are just two more days
to the Bangalore Competition.

785
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,035
Come on.

786
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,198
Vinnie, you go!

787
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:22,471
Strong... hold firm!

788
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,607
Back straight.

789
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,004
Suru, follow me.

790
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,611
Well done, boys!

791
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:37,157
Keep it strong.
It's becoming loose.

792
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,522
Five... six... seven... eight...

793
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,790
ls this what you are going
to do at the competition?

794
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,665
Make some space for me.

795
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,509
We don't dance this much
in my hometown.

796
00:53:57,668 --> 00:53:59,306
We danced a lot.
Pass the water.

797
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:05,009
Where's the deodorant?

798
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,389
Why don't you wash your socks?

799
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,263
What happened?

800
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:37,114
- Hey listen, everyone is waiting.

801
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:39,245
- Why are you standing alone
and getting sentimental?

802
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:42,689
- What are you thinking about?

803
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,090
- I'm thinking about
the Bangalore competition.

804
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:46,686
- Who knows what will happen tomorrow.

805
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:54,258
Once more... once more.

806
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,598
Come on, boys.

807
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,171
The next round, D-Maniacs...

808
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:11,676
Look at them... cheaters!
Wonder who they will copy ne><t.

809
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,685
We just have a small problem.
I'll be back.

810
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,422
Excuse me, guys.

811
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,429
Suresh...

812
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:27,999
Yes?

813
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,731
Mumbai Stunners!
- Yes.

814
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:31,471
You are quite famous.

815
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:33,640
Take your group and go back.

816
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:34,539
You guys are disqualified.

817
00:55:34,598 --> 00:55:36,043
Why are we disqualified, sir?
- Excuse me!

818
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,238
Disqualified?

819
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:39,472
Even before the performance?
On what grounds?

820
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:42,607
The organisers can disqualify any team
before their performance.

821
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,051
Yes. But there should be
a valid reason.

822
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,211
Who are you?

823
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:49,655
Vishnu.

824
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,021
Mr. Vishnu...

825
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:54,085
This is not a reality show for TRPs.

826
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:57,392
This is a serious,
very serious dance competition.

827
00:55:58,155 --> 00:56:00,601
The audience here has some of
India's best hip-hop dancers...

828
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:02,660
who do not want to see your team.

829
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:07,032
The team that wins here
will represent India in Vegas.

830
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,569
And cheaters can't represent India.

831
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:10,509
Sir, we are not cheaters...

832
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,536
We will refund your entry fee.
You guys can leave.

833
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:15,641
Sir, give us one chance.
Please!

834
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:19,216
Vishnu sir...
- Please tell them.

835
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,190
Nothing's wrong.

836
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:30,186
The team that wins today
will go to Vegas!

837
00:57:30,247 --> 00:57:32,386
The teams that made
it to the finals are...

838
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:35,329
Desi Tigers, Dancing Parrots,

839
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:36,622
Ulvlaniac...

840
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:38,089
Red Hustle...

841
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:39,759
and Frequency.

842
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,264
Now let's get them on stage.

843
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:48,101
Cheaters! Cheaters! Cheaters!

844
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:51,174
Excuse me. Please.

845
00:57:51,368 --> 00:57:54,144
Give us a minute.
Just one minute, please.

846
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:56,244
I am Vishnu.

847
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:59,110
I have got a team here from Mumbai.

848
00:57:59,176 --> 00:58:00,120
Whose name is...

849
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:02,248
- Cheaters!

850
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,088
- Cheaters, go home!

851
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:07,961
Yes.

852
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:11,256
You were saying this outside as well.

853
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,391
You are right.

854
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,434
I am happy that the audience...

855
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:20,033
sitting here is honest.

856
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,709
Yes, some of the dancers in our team

857
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,272
have cheated earlier.

858
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:26,375
They must be punished for it.

859
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,676
And they have been.

860
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:31,041
They were disqualified.
Remember?

861
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:37,592
You only saw that
they had copied the steps.

862
00:58:38,382 --> 00:58:40,555
But no one saw...

863
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,623
how brilliant their performance was.

864
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:49,435
Everyone makes mistakes.

865
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:51,266
But life is all about...

866
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:53,702
a second chance.

867
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,444
I request you, that if you have ever

868
00:58:58,502 --> 00:59:00,448
given yourself a second chance...

869
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,677
please do so with
the Stunners as well.

870
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,385
Because they are
the Indian Stunners...

871
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:06,149
not M um bai Stunners.

872
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:08,714
My team.

873
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,351
Give them one chance.

874
00:59:11,415 --> 00:59:15,329
After that, if you like,
you can show them the door.

875
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,166
But please...

876
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,430
give them a chance.

877
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:55,731
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

878
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:56,664
But I am stubborn

879
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:59,173
I will race ahead of my fate
You cannot stop me

880
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:00,264
Knock me down, I will get up

881
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,606
Break the cage and spread my wings

882
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:05,112
Give it all your might but

883
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:08,342
I will bear it with a smile,
won't bow down my head

884
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,652
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

885
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:25,029
Knock me down, I will get up

886
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:31,163
As much fire as the deserts hold

887
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:35,540
Furious is the blood
In my veins, but still

888
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:40,048
Ashes suffice for the faithful

889
01:00:40,704 --> 01:00:44,652
My silence is enough for me.

890
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:49,589
I have been silenced for so long

891
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:54,391
innocently, I have been bearing it.

892
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:59,196
I have been silenced for so long

893
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:04,035
innocently, I have been bearing it.

894
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:13,480
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

895
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:27,495
There are a hundred questions

896
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:32,463
There are a hundred insults

897
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:40,437
My name bears the burden of stains

898
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:44,741
With the ashes
Burnt by a million dreams

899
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:50,208
These tearless eyes
Bear the last string of hope

900
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,412
We were not given another chance

901
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:55,082
Or forgiveness

902
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:59,258
l-low much more do we need to suffer'?

903
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:04,061
I have been silenced for so long

904
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:08,729
innocently, I have been bearing it.

905
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:13,532
I have been silenced for so long

906
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:18,205
innocently, I have been bearing it.

907
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:49,373
Know this, fate has strewn
Thorns in my path

908
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,313
But I am stubborn
I will race ahead of my fate

909
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:57,177
You cannot stop me
Knock me down, I will get up

910
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,080
Break the cage and spread my wings

911
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:04,115
Give it all your might but

912
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:12,694
I will bear it with a smile,
won't bow down my head

913
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:50,595
Vegas! Vegas!

914
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:54,808
See what the bill is.

915
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,177
What do you think?

916
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,278
I look like a fool?

917
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:00,579
I am asking them...

918
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,048
whether I look like a fool that...

919
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:03,642
he is asking for twenty five lakhs?

920
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:05,015
What should I do?

921
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,255
Anna, are you joking?
I trusted you...

922
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,312
Am I joking? Or are you?

923
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,287
I agree that you are like family.

924
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:14,156
You come and party here with your
friends after you finish your duty.

925
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:15,992
I have never said anything.
- No... I...

926
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:17,722
Whenever you have wanted an advance
twenty - fifty thousand...

927
01:04:17,988 --> 01:04:19,467
I have given it to you...
So that you can go have fun.

928
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:20,501
But today you asked me...

929
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:22,366
'Uncle l-larish,
I want twenty five lakhs!'

930
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,403
ls that a piece of cake?

931
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:26,265
Anna, you had promised.

932
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,002
In trusting you, I told everyone...

933
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:30,203
Then you should break the promise.
It's that simple.

934
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,108
It's not the word of someone great.

935
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,475
It's waiter Suresh's promise.

936
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:34,674
Break it with a crack.

937
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,445
Anna, we have worked very hard.

938
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:38,415
We won in Bangalore.

939
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,283
And even if we come third in Vegas...

940
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,017
I will give back your money
upon my return...

941
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,149
Anna, I promise.

942
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,553
Anna, this is wrong.

943
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,424
I trusted you and told everyone...

944
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:50,727
This word 'trust' is irritating me.

945
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,394
It is firing me up.
What trust?

946
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:57,629
You've become very sad.

947
01:04:57,694 --> 01:04:59,230
Listen, I will explain to you.

948
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:01,301
If you are going to
Vegas for this girl...

949
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,002
Don't you say anything about Vinnie...

950
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,478
Listen to me... it's not worth it.

951
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,976
It's better to go
to our local Ivladh Island...

952
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:10,142
Twenty five hundred will suffice. Yes?

953
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,445
I told you not to talk
about Vinnie like that.

954
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:13,681
Suru, let him be.

955
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,053
Suru, leave him. Come on.

956
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,653
Let it go...

957
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:19,149
Let's go...

958
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,193
You are my own.

959
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:29,264
Take him away.
- Cheater!

960
01:05:29,326 --> 01:05:30,361
Go home!

961
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:31,728
Going to Vegas?

962
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:35,235
Come.
- Get out of here.

963
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,072
Suru. Let it be.

964
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,076
He has gone mad.

965
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,168
If you don't want to give
the money, then don't.

966
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:39,611
Don't you talk rubbish about the girl.

967
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,114
Come on, Suru.
I will break apart the entire place.

968
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:42,514
- I will send you to the police station.
- Call them.

969
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:43,516
- Stop it! Please.

970
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,644
They will take you.
You can dance there.

971
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,553
Now the money won't come
from there at all.

972
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:52,453
What shall we do?

973
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:53,550
- It's over.

974
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:54,653
After all this effort...

975
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:56,356
we've been reduced from
a passport to a ration card.

976
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,296
Don't get started again, Raghav.
- Okay.

977
01:05:58,488 --> 01:05:59,558
Let's go to Vegas.

978
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,068
It is important for me
to go to go to Vegas, too.

979
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:03,434
But not at the cost of her honour.
- Suru, look...

980
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:05,028
ls Vegas cancelled?

981
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:05,470
Sorry, sir.

982
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:06,598
Give me an answer...

983
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,143
You said that you would
get the money.

984
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:10,075
I did.
- Yes?

985
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:10,975
Yes, I did.
- Tell me...

986
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:13,173
Sir, it is not Suru's fault.

987
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:14,610
Shetty Anna didn't keep his word...

988
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:15,513
Sir.
- Sir...

989
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:17,114
You idiot!

990
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,175
You wasted so much of my time.

991
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:20,744
Sir, please.

992
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:21,682
Please, sir.

993
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,155
Sir, sorry. Please, sir.
- I am sorry.

994
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:24,214
Sorry.

995
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,385
It is my fault. Vishnu sir.

996
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:30,019
We have managed only three lakhs
twenty thousand.

997
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:34,194
Shall I take a loan from aunt Ashima.

998
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:36,031
Or should I sell my bike.

999
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:38,433
Hey guys!

1000
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,031
Where do you want to take the ferry
to Vegas from?

1001
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,404
From Versova or from Ivladh?

1002
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,568
What are you saying?

1003
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:44,543
Why are you upset?
Don't you want to go?

1004
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:46,673
Cockroach,
where did you get this money?

1005
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,238
Yes. Vishnu sir.

1006
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:49,642
Vishnu sir has given it?

1007
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:51,548
Vishnu sir hasn't given it.

1008
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:52,678
I took an idea from Vishnu sir...

1009
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:53,686
thought about it and

1010
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,154
took the money from my uncle.

1011
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:56,623
- Vishnu...

1012
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,020
What is the need to sell this place?

1013
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,724
You sold your land for us?

1014
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:04,397
Do I need the place for my burial?

1015
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:06,365
We will win and come back.

1016
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:08,134
Thank you.

1017
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:09,569
Suru.

1018
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:11,733
What did you think?

1019
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,633
That I could not think
because I was angry?

1020
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:17,574
Guys, get ready for Vegas?

1021
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:19,477
Yes, sir!

1022
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:12,490
Yes, it is done.

1023
01:08:13,156 --> 01:08:14,260
The visas are done and

1024
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:16,065
we have the money
for the ticket as well.

1025
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:17,728
I am coming to America.

1026
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:19,667
Today is the best day of my life.

1027
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:22,335
Best. Best. Best. Yes!

1028
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,352
America. Vegas. Happy.

1029
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:37,253
Happy, happy-

1030
01:08:38,014 --> 01:08:41,587
Vinod, I have been trying
since eight years.

1031
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:43,623
It has come true now.

1032
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:45,098
I will make my dream come true.

1033
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,396
You think Suresh and
Vernon found me?

1034
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,699
I found them.

1035
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,605
Come, sit. I will tell you everything.

1036
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:55,643
Who will you tell anyway...

1037
01:08:56,099 --> 01:08:57,407
I don't care what you guys do

1038
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,741
once you get to Vegas.

1039
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:01,209
But I have my plans laid out.

1040
01:09:01,404 --> 01:09:03,315
I was there when Suresh

1041
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:04,708
was planning Vegas.

1042
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:07,349
I met him.

1043
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,115
Repeatedly.

1044
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,522
I impressed him.

1045
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,987
I impressed all of you

1046
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:15,490
and became your guru.

1047
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:18,259
And now finally, my plan
is about to take off!

1048
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:21,298
Vegas, I'm on my way!

1049
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:02,766
- Stop! Stop!

1050
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,870
- You, you, you! Step aside.

1051
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:18,348
Really?

1052
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:19,849
A hip-hop show.

1053
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:21,988
ls this yours?

1054
01:10:22,252 --> 01:10:24,254
Oh, what do we have here?

1055
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:29,468
Do you have a prescription
for this, sir?

1056
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:32,798
Hold on.

1057
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:35,672
No prescription. No medicine.

1058
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:36,733
- Sorry.

1059
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:39,478
Hey...

1060
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:43,442
I need you guys...

1061
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:47,411
to take off your jackets
and your shoes.

1062
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:48,514
Shoes?

1063
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:49,648
- Yes, shoes.

1064
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:52,490
Shoes.

1065
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:54,794
Shoes!

1066
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,317
Guys, come on.

1067
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:34,633
Hi!

1068
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,734
India. .. Indian Stunners.

1069
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:37,931
Control yourself, Vinnie.

1070
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:42,774
Alright! Here are your badges...

1071
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,275
You guys go straight and left.

1072
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:47,547
Left?

1073
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:56,585
Boys, there are a lot of teams...

1074
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,284
therefore, we have got a few rooms.

1075
01:11:58,348 --> 01:11:59,986
Of course, there is one for me...

1076
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,284
one for Vinnie and

1077
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:04,457
one for all the boys...

1078
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:20,972
Check that out!

1079
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:26,481
This is mind blowing!

1080
01:12:47,297 --> 01:12:53,805
Sorry sorry sorry...
Will you punish me for it?

1081
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:57,817
Yes, Vegas!

1082
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,877
Boys, is there a place

1083
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:02,947
like this in the whole world'?
- It's fun like none other.

1084
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:05,984
Sir... sir.

1085
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:08,525
Sir! It's only apple juice.

1086
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:10,924
Vinnie, go out.

1087
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:11,761
- Sit in the water.

1088
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:12,822
He)’, guys.

1089
01:13:13,323 --> 01:13:15,803
Juniors and Varsity compete
in the next two days.

1090
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,769
There is still some time
for the main event.

1091
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:20,630
Sir, what will we do for two days?

1092
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:21,766
We will rehearse.

1093
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:23,504
Be quiet. Are you crazy! No.

1094
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:24,636
Guys, you are in Vegas.

1095
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:27,648
Everyone knows what
an amazing place this is.

1096
01:13:27,704 --> 01:13:29,342
So, whatever you want to do, do it.

1097
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,215
I don't ask you and
you don't ask me where I was.

1098
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,371
You are our God!

1099
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:17,220
This heart has been saved
A hundred times

1100
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,330
The heart has escaped
A hundred times

1101
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:23,927
We forgot the world

1102
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:27,731
After finding love!

1103
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:31,708
There is me and you, the way
To the heart is through itself

1104
01:14:31,768 --> 01:14:34,772
But this feeling is a little new
Know this!

1105
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:39,251
There is me and you
Why do you ask, ‘What to do?‘

1106
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:42,413
The fun starts now
Dance away!

1107
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:47,292
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1108
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:50,888
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1109
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:54,696
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1110
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:58,466
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1111
01:14:58,761 --> 01:15:01,742
No worries
Dance, my love, dance!

1112
01:15:01,798 --> 01:15:05,974
Listen! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1113
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:31,937
Do as I do,

1114
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:35,904
Then why feel shy?

1115
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:42,741
Forget about the morning
The game is on for tonight

1116
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:46,850
I have seen, I have heard
Deeds of this day

1117
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:50,379
It is a secret
Know this!

1118
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:54,423
There is me and you, the way
To the heart is through itself

1119
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:57,487
But this feeling is a little new
Know this!

1120
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:02,398
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1121
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:05,905
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1122
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:09,335
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1123
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:13,608
Listen! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1124
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:25,349
Hi,
Are you Indian?

1125
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,394
Mobile number?
- Thanks.

1126
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:28,451
I'll call you.

1127
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:47,513
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1128
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,813
O O O Listen...
Dance, my love, dance!

1129
01:16:54,877 --> 01:16:58,654
Hey! O O O
Dance, my love, dance!

1130
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,201
Five... six... seven... eight...

1131
01:17:22,905 --> 01:17:24,612
You should drink in moderation.

1132
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:26,375
That's enough.

1133
01:17:26,442 --> 01:17:29,321
Come on. Let's practice again.

1134
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:31,153
Chotu, give us the count. Come on...

1135
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:33,352
I've seen many enthusiastic dancers...

1136
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:34,588
but not one more
enthusiastic than her.

1137
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,822
What does she eat?

1138
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:39,291
Don't you guys want to rehearse?
- No...

1139
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:41,528
Vinnie, we have practiced
nearly fifteen times.

1140
01:17:41,591 --> 01:17:42,626
The boys are very tired.

1141
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:44,364
Please. And Vishnu sir had said

1142
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:45,838
that we do not have to
rehearse so many times.

1143
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:47,739
But why are rehearsals a problem?

1144
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:49,799
Rehearsing too much
could cause injuries.

1145
01:17:50,266 --> 01:17:51,267
Exactly, sir.

1146
01:17:51,434 --> 01:17:53,880
The number one reason for injuries

1147
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:55,814
during competitions, is fatigue.

1148
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:57,351
In the excitement of
being in a new place...

1149
01:17:57,406 --> 01:17:59,886
you have forgotten
that your body needs rest.

1150
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,845
That is why I told you, no rehearsals.

1151
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:03,851
Someone take control of Vinnie!

1152
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:04,823
Got that?

1153
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:08,456
We had carried so much
money from Mumbai.

1154
01:18:08,518 --> 01:18:09,360
Now, there's barely anything.

1155
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:11,659
If luck was on our side,
it would have doubled.

1156
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,861
This is the team's money, idiots!

1157
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:17,366
Vishnu sir is here.

1158
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,235
Sir...

1159
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:20,774
Please keep the money with you.

1160
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:22,400
The boys are up to a lot of mischief
since yesterday.

1161
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:23,375
They will spend it all.

1162
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:24,843
It is your responsibility from now on.
Please...

1163
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:26,209
Come on. Let's go!

1164
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,156
I think we will have to
practice in that area.

1165
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:42,522
Oh! Philippines...

1166
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:44,792
Boys, Philippine All Stars.

1167
01:18:46,589 --> 01:18:48,569
Let's go meet them.

1168
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,832
Sir, I love you...
I love your dance!

1169
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:11,815
Wait...

1170
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,394
What's wrong with you?

1171
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:16,729
Suru.

1172
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:19,291
Guys, what happened?

1173
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:21,827
Okay. Hold it. Guys...

1174
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:23,768
I am sorry.
- Go.

1175
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:26,632
Yes, I have the money.

1176
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:29,638
They have moved to
the qualifying round.

1177
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:34,211
Such great teams from all over
the world have come here.

1178
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:37,649
I am worried.
If they don't qualify...

1179
01:19:37,707 --> 01:19:39,709
then along with them...

1180
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,755
even I will have to go back to India.

1181
01:19:44,213 --> 01:19:45,487
Ladies and Gentlemen...

1182
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:47,755
Welcome to Las Vegas, Nevada.

1183
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:52,722
Ladies and gentlemen,
I also want to thank our friends at...

1184
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,631
Ponds Men's Face Wash.

1185
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:56,425
Ladies and Gentlemen...

1186
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:57,994
I proudly bring to you...

1187
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:03,605
the Ponds Men's Face Wash
World Starz Hip Hop Challenge.

1188
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,601
The Philippine All Stars!

1189
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,975
Victory to Mother India.

1190
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:43,612
Viva, Brazil!

1191
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,379
Super Hoods!

1192
01:20:47,777 --> 01:20:49,654
That was superb!

1193
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,491
Very nice... superb, boys!

1194
01:20:55,918 --> 01:21:00,458
Oh, look at you...
Go home... No qualify!

1195
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:03,732
What's his problem?

1196
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:05,961
Come on, boys.

1197
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:08,265
Let's go, boys!

1198
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:14,843
My oh my! Bringing a little curry

1199
01:21:14,904 --> 01:21:16,850
in a Hip Hop flavor...

1200
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:21,513
there is also a team from India!

1201
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:21,366
- Can you feel all that energy
in the atmosphere?

1202
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:24,240
The Indian Stunners,
all the way from India...

1203
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,802
have entered the contest.

1204
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:31,381
Vishnu sir, we have qualified!
Sir, we made it.

1205
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:34,252
Here we are at the
World Starz Hip Hop Competition

1206
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:36,517
Here we have the team from India...

1207
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:37,955
win here for the first time ever.

1208
01:23:38,214 --> 01:23:40,717
It's your first time here ever...

1209
01:23:40,783 --> 01:23:42,353
and you have stormed
into the qualifiers.

1210
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:43,658
L-low does it feel'?

1211
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:47,526
Yes... yes, we are all very happy.

1212
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:49,269
we have reached the qualifier round

1213
01:23:49,325 --> 01:23:51,669
for the first time.
- Speak to her in English.

1214
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:52,933
Yes! Yes!

1215
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:53,730
And... first time.

1216
01:23:53,796 --> 01:23:54,570
It's history.

1217
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,405
In the first attempt, a country

1218
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:57,842
has reached the qualifying round.

1219
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,379
And that's why all the boys

1220
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:01,278
are happy and even the girl.

1221
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:02,474
Victory to India.

1222
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:04,413
There is so much excitement there...

1223
01:24:04,473 --> 01:24:05,952
you can feel it. That's great!

1224
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,710
This is our guru, our choreographer.

1225
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:10,519
This is the guru.
Let's ask him - how do you feel'?

1226
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:11,786
What do you want to say?

1227
01:24:12,982 --> 01:24:14,290
I am haPPY-

1228
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:16,327
He is happy.

1229
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:34,605
Come on...
five... six... seven... eight.

1230
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:36,240
Lift her, hold. Superb!

1231
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:39,648
Very good, guys.
Get her down.

1232
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,916
Super, boys!
Very good Vinnie, Vernon.

1233
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,292
Let's do it once more.
- Please, no...

1234
01:24:47,349 --> 01:24:48,555
Please.
- One more time.

1235
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,621
You have irritated us by rehearsing
fifty times already.

1236
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:52,859
The boys are tired, Vinnie...
- Tell her...

1237
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,461
I want to do the lift once more.

1238
01:24:54,523 --> 01:24:56,764
Come on, boys.

1239
01:24:56,892 --> 01:24:57,962
Come on, boys.

1240
01:24:58,494 --> 01:24:59,472
Yes. Last one, please.

1241
01:24:59,528 --> 01:25:00,404
Suru, last one, please.

1242
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:01,202
Q Kay-

1243
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:02,565
Boys.

1244
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:04,572
Ready?

1245
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:07,273
Five... six... seven... go...

1246
01:25:07,536 --> 01:25:10,517
Hope... hold.

1247
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:12,884
Guys, hold her firmly.

1248
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,614
I told you not to practice
so many times.

1249
01:25:14,677 --> 01:25:15,621
Didn't I?

1250
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:17,653
She insisted.

1251
01:25:19,348 --> 01:25:20,418
Suru...

1252
01:25:21,717 --> 01:25:22,559
Go to her.

1253
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,325
What happened? Are you okay?
- Suru...

1254
01:25:24,353 --> 01:25:25,354
ls it hurting?

1255
01:25:30,893 --> 01:25:31,928
D...

1256
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:34,440
Call Vishnu sir.

1257
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,602
Tell him that Vinnie is hurt
and to come to the hospital quickly.

1258
01:25:36,665 --> 01:25:38,167
I've run out credits,
can I use your phone?

1259
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:39,610
Here.
Nevada Hills Hospital.

1260
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:40,840
Hurry UP-

1261
01:25:42,905 --> 01:25:44,407
Vinnie...

1262
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,615
Hi, Vinnie.
- Hi!

1263
01:25:46,942 --> 01:25:48,580
Sir, is she okay?

1264
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,590
Yes. Well,
I have checked Vinnie's scan.

1265
01:25:50,613 --> 01:25:52,559
She has a stretched deltoid...

1266
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:54,719
and an out of line femur.

1267
01:25:55,284 --> 01:25:57,628
Doctor, has she broken a bone?

1268
01:25:57,953 --> 01:26:00,194
No. No. The bone has not broken.

1269
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:01,593
Thank God!

1270
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:02,829
So can we take her home?

1271
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:05,428
By all means. But she needs rice...

1272
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:07,405
Rice. I told you to eat rice.

1273
01:26:07,463 --> 01:26:08,498
She was not eating rice.

1274
01:26:08,564 --> 01:26:12,273
Sir, she doesn't eat rice,
only flatbreads.

1275
01:26:12,401 --> 01:26:13,971
No. Not that rice.

1276
01:26:14,236 --> 01:26:15,340
R-I-C-E.

1277
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,882
Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation.

1278
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,384
You understand?

1279
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:20,579
Yes.

1280
01:26:20,743 --> 01:26:21,881
Can she dance?

1281
01:26:21,944 --> 01:26:22,888
No. I am afraid not.

1282
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:24,891
She needs rest for at least a week.

1283
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:25,891
One...

1284
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:27,325
One week!

1285
01:26:27,883 --> 01:26:28,827
Q Kay-

1286
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:30,419
Here is her file.

1287
01:26:31,153 --> 01:26:31,893
Don't worry, she will be fine.

1288
01:26:32,154 --> 01:26:33,531
Don't worry, my dear.
You'll be fine.

1289
01:26:33,922 --> 01:26:35,401
Thank you, sir.
- That's okay.

1290
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:39,465
I'm sorry, Suru...

1291
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:41,565
No need to apologize.
There's nothing wrong with you.

1292
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:43,208
You'll be alright...

1293
01:26:43,265 --> 01:26:45,267
It's my fault...

1294
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:47,211
Vishnu sir told us
not to rehearse so much

1295
01:26:47,269 --> 01:26:49,442
and I got over-excited...

1296
01:26:49,471 --> 01:26:50,575
I'm really sorry!

1297
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:51,777
I'm in the centre of our next <i>act...</i>

1298
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,444
Now what will we do?

1299
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:56,655
Listen... don't get worked up... we'll
make some changes in the routine...

1300
01:26:57,413 --> 01:26:59,450
We'll do something...
- Have you lost it?

1301
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:02,224
We'll lose a lot of time doing this...

1302
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:05,426
Suru, we'll need to
find a replacement for her.

1303
01:27:05,487 --> 01:27:08,229
And how do we do that'?
We are in Vegas!

1304
01:27:08,657 --> 01:27:09,897
We need an Indian dancer...

1305
01:27:10,192 --> 01:27:11,796
here and now...
Where will we find someone now?

1306
01:27:11,894 --> 01:27:14,431
We'll get...
- From where?

1307
01:27:15,364 --> 01:27:16,536
We will surely...

1308
01:27:19,201 --> 01:27:20,646
Who knew Vernon is this clever...

1309
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:27,146
Vernon, where are you taking us?

1310
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:41,865
Come! Say where pal'?

01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:46,303

- Yes... come on.

1338
01:31:16,371 --> 01:31:18,510
Hi, Olive!
- Hi Vernon, hovv are you?

1339
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:19,916
I'm good.

1340
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:22,581
Hey, sorry to call you so fast...
but you said it was urgent.

1341
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:24,646
Yes it's urgent...
this is my team.

1342
01:31:24,713 --> 01:31:26,317
Hey guys!

1343
01:31:26,515 --> 01:31:27,585
- Let me tell her...

1344
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:31,620
He says that you dance very well.

1345
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,722
Very well.

1346
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:35,666
English.
- I have to speak to her in English?

1347
01:31:36,358 --> 01:31:37,769
You dance very...

1348
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:40,432
Good.
- Goodly. Good...

1349
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:41,496
Ah! Thank you very much.

1350
01:31:41,563 --> 01:31:42,871
You dance very well, too.

1351
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:44,239
Oh, thank you.

1352
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,570
And Vinnie? Where is Vinnie?

1353
01:31:46,635 --> 01:31:48,876
You know Vinnie as well?

1354
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:50,746
Come on. Everyone knows you guys.

1355
01:31:50,806 --> 01:31:52,786
You guys are the
Indian Stunners, right?

1356
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:53,785
I know.

1357
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:54,786
Did you hear that, buddy?

1358
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:57,585
Yes. But maybe you don't know that
Vinnie has recently injured herself.

1359
01:31:57,646 --> 01:31:58,522
What?

1360
01:31:59,815 --> 01:32:01,226
We need your help, Olive.

1361
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,728
So, this is where we kind of rehearse.

1362
01:32:04,786 --> 01:32:05,696
Wow! It's huge.

1363
01:32:05,754 --> 01:32:07,290
Boys, this is Olive.

1364
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:08,333
We've got the permissions.

1365
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:10,631
And now she's in our team.
Any questions?

1366
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:12,433
This is Vinnie... That's Jack.

1367
01:32:12,494 --> 01:32:14,440
This is Pawan
- l-low are you'?

1368
01:32:14,496 --> 01:32:16,271
Everyone say 'hi'!

1369
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:18,834
This is so bad.
You are hurt so badly.

1370
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:22,674
Guys, this is great!

1371
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:24,717
What are you saying, Vinnie?
Look at your leg.

1372
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:26,611
Vernon, it is great.

1373
01:32:26,675 --> 01:32:28,313
If she hadn't hurt herself

1374
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,481
how would a great dancer
like Olive have joined our group'?

1375
01:32:30,512 --> 01:32:31,684
I guess
- Really!

1376
01:32:31,746 --> 01:32:33,282
That's so mean.

1377
01:32:33,348 --> 01:32:34,918
Olive, don't listen to him.

1378
01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:36,526
He is talking rubbish.
- Seriously.

1379
01:32:37,686 --> 01:32:39,723
Anyway. Where is Vishnu sir?

1380
01:32:57,939 --> 01:32:59,850
I haven't seen him after
the qualifiers. I will look for him.

1381
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:02,514
Vernon, you will have to teach Olive.
You wait.

1382
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,822
Yes. The choreography.
I need to learn this.

1383
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,554
Yes, we will. D, you go.

1384
01:33:07,616 --> 01:33:08,424
Raghav, you too.

1385
01:33:08,483 --> 01:33:10,326
Tell him we are at rehearsals
and to come quickly.

1386
01:33:10,385 --> 01:33:10,954
Go quickly.

1387
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:13,495
Boys, hurry up.
Raghav, that way.

1388
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:32,509
Five and six...
- Boys!

1389
01:33:33,542 --> 01:33:37,183
Guys, guys, guys.
We are doomed.

1390
01:33:37,212 --> 01:33:38,486
Vishnu sir is nowhere to be seen.

1391
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:39,547
He has even checked out of the hotel.

1392
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:40,490
All the money is also with him.

1393
01:33:40,549 --> 01:33:41,425
What do you mean?

1394
01:33:41,483 --> 01:33:42,826
I mean he is a thief.

1395
01:33:42,884 --> 01:33:44,522
You took the money
from me to give to him.

1396
01:33:44,586 --> 01:33:46,532
I told you, don't trust this man.

1397
01:33:46,822 --> 01:33:48,665
Did you guy check properly
near the bed and...

1398
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:50,725
He just told you,
he has checked out...

1399
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,237
He is nowhere. There is nothing.

1400
01:33:52,294 --> 01:33:53,796
All the money, everything is gone.

1401
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:55,670
My uncle will kill me.

1402
01:33:55,730 --> 01:33:56,902
He had given the money
with a lot of difficulty.

1403
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:58,808
The competition is
still to come, Suru.

1404
01:34:00,735 --> 01:34:01,873
Think of something.

1405
01:34:01,937 --> 01:34:04,417
- He took a bag...
He left with the money.

1406
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:05,883
The entire competition
is still ahead of us.

1407
01:34:05,941 --> 01:34:07,352
We have nothing in our pockets.

1408
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:08,649
What will we do now?

1409
01:34:09,511 --> 01:34:11,684
We cannot do anything.
- What should we do?

1410
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:13,487
Now what? Pick up your bags
and let's go.

1411
01:34:13,548 --> 01:34:15,619
Boys...
- Nothing can be done now.

1412
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:18,687
We are done with the competition.

1413
01:34:19,421 --> 01:34:20,593
Boys...
- What will we do?

1414
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,431
Yes, let's go... Let's go.

1415
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,663
Hurry up. Pack your bags.
- Suru...

1416
01:34:24,726 --> 01:34:26,865
Vinnie, pack up. Let's go.

1417
01:34:31,933 --> 01:34:34,311
Why did you come here? Why?

1418
01:34:36,171 --> 01:34:38,811
For the competition.
- "For the competition... competition..."

1419
01:34:40,809 --> 01:34:41,844
And why did you come?

1420
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:43,414
Why did we come, Vernon?

1421
01:34:43,612 --> 01:34:47,492
You have been a background dancer
for the last ten years in India.

1422
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:51,422
And you?

1423
01:34:51,486 --> 01:34:54,592
You cannot speak...
why did you come here?

1424
01:34:54,956 --> 01:34:55,934
<i>To Vegas. .. Why?</i>

1425
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:01,269
For honour.

1426
01:35:01,797 --> 01:35:03,674
And you, D?
Why did you come here?

1427
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:05,404
You were so popular in Gujarat.

1428
01:35:05,467 --> 01:35:07,378
Young kids used to learn from you,
isn't it?

1429
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:10,473
Why are you teaching kids hip-hop?

1430
01:35:10,539 --> 01:35:11,711
Why are you wasting their time?

1431
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:13,883
Just so that we can show everyone...

1432
01:35:13,942 --> 01:35:16,445
back home that we are thieves?

1433
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,684
Previously when we were
the Mumbai Stunners...

1434
01:35:19,848 --> 01:35:21,623
They told us that we had copied...

1435
01:35:22,317 --> 01:35:24,524
But now we are the Indian Stunners.

1436
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:27,390
Indian Stunners... We represent India.

1437
01:35:28,523 --> 01:35:31,163
If the choreographer leaves if
one person leaves, is the group over?

1438
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:32,904
ls Indian Stunners over?

1439
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:34,763
Let everyone hear it.

1440
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:36,467
Let them all know too,
the Philippines...

1441
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:38,841
and English team see that
Indians are thieves...

1442
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,675
ls that what you want to show?

1443
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:43,511
Say it. Let me hear it.

1444
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:46,645
I am here in front of you, right?

1445
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:48,182
Vernon is here, too.

1446
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:51,349
Each one of us is here to dance.

1447
01:35:51,613 --> 01:35:52,819
We want to dance.

1448
01:35:57,819 --> 01:35:59,799
We dance to express, not to impress.

1449
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:01,765
We've not come here for money.

1450
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:07,431
So just dance.

1451
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:08,599
Don't worry about the money.

1452
01:36:09,531 --> 01:36:10,601
We will deal with everything later.

1453
01:36:10,665 --> 01:36:12,542
We came here to dance
and dance, we will.

1454
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,375
Yes.
- Come on, boys.

1455
01:36:17,372 --> 01:36:18,544
Let's take it from the top, Vernon.
- Come on.

1456
01:36:18,573 --> 01:36:20,644
Five... six... seven... eight...

1457
01:36:20,709 --> 01:36:21,949
One and two... three and four...

1458
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:23,348
One and two... three and four...

1459
01:36:23,411 --> 01:36:25,584
Five and six... seven and eight...

1460
01:36:25,647 --> 01:36:27,320
Bring her down carefully.

1461
01:36:27,549 --> 01:36:28,857
Very good. Good job!

1462
01:36:28,917 --> 01:36:30,487
Very good, Olive!

1463
01:36:30,552 --> 01:36:32,293
Superb!
- Vernon, it is good.

1464
01:36:32,721 --> 01:36:34,166
Can you give me some water.

1465
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:38,803
Vernon, that can be bettered.
- Suru...

1466
01:36:39,327 --> 01:36:40,829
Sit here for a minute please.
- What is it?

1467
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:48,403
I hope you realize that
you have persuaded them again.

1468
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:50,408
I know.

1469
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:52,614
But if I wouldn't
have said all that...

1470
01:36:52,907 --> 01:36:54,614
our team wouldn't have reached here.

1471
01:36:55,276 --> 01:36:58,553
But money is so
important at this point.

1472
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,686
If we don't have the money
after the performance...

1473
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:02,193
what will we do?

1474
01:37:21,469 --> 01:37:22,345
Vishnu...

1475
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:29,187
Hi, Swati.

1476
01:37:35,383 --> 01:37:36,726
Have a seat.

1477
01:37:53,401 --> 01:37:55,176
Did you come to America
for some work?

1478
01:37:57,305 --> 01:38:01,310
Swati, it has taken me
eight years to get here.

1479
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:05,548
You have no idea what all I have gone
through in these eight years, Swati.

1480
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,451
I have only come...

1481
01:38:09,517 --> 01:38:11,963
to meet my son Ivlanu.

1482
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,733
What will you accomplish
by meeting Ivlanu now?

1483
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:20,600
- Isn't it a little too late?

1484
01:38:22,297 --> 01:38:23,367
I am married now.

1485
01:38:24,532 --> 01:38:25,772
Ivlanu has a father

1486
01:38:26,768 --> 01:38:28,270
who loves him a lot.

1487
01:38:29,704 --> 01:38:32,207
He is a normal man...

1488
01:38:32,473 --> 01:38:33,543
who has a normal job.

1489
01:38:33,608 --> 01:38:35,212
He goes to the office.

1490
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:37,323
He has the weekends off

1491
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:39,790
and takes his family out.

1492
01:38:40,181 --> 01:38:41,592
He is a normal guy.

1493
01:38:41,849 --> 01:38:43,260
He looks after us...

1494
01:38:43,718 --> 01:38:45,857
He is not a struggling choreographer

1495
01:38:45,887 --> 01:38:48,231
who is always on the
lookout for his next job.

1496
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:49,725
You understand?

1497
01:38:57,699 --> 01:39:01,306
Vishnu, relationships
are made and broken.

1498
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:04,672
I have moved on.

1499
01:39:06,207 --> 01:39:07,185
So should you.

1500
01:39:07,575 --> 01:39:09,612
I know... but...

1501
01:39:10,345 --> 01:39:12,518
Our relationship can break.

1502
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:16,289
But not menu's and mine.

1503
01:39:17,385 --> 01:39:20,491
You live your life.
Be happy. No problem.

1504
01:39:20,622 --> 01:39:22,863
But please let me meet Ivlanu once.

1505
01:39:27,328 --> 01:39:28,807
I don't think it is a good idea.

1506
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:33,536
I think you should leave now.

1507
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:34,946
<i>Reese Swain.</i>

1508
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:36,404
I am sorry.

1509
01:39:37,872 --> 01:39:38,714
<i>- Hey, mom.</i>

1510
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,610
Hey, you are Vishnu. Aren't you?

1511
01:40:11,272 --> 01:40:12,478
Oh, hello, Vishnu sir.

1512
01:40:12,774 --> 01:40:13,912
Mom, you know him?

1513
01:40:13,975 --> 01:40:14,817
You know him?

1514
01:40:14,876 --> 01:40:16,287
Of course I know him.

1515
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:17,982
He is Vishnu. Vishnu sir.

1516
01:40:18,246 --> 01:40:19,520
Where is your phone?

1517
01:40:19,581 --> 01:40:20,855
Yes. Here...

1518
01:40:38,833 --> 01:40:40,210
Hey... This is you, right?

1519
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:43,408
Yes! I knew it.

1520
01:40:43,571 --> 01:40:44,413
Mom...

1521
01:40:46,741 --> 01:40:47,719
You like hip-hop?

1522
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,445
Of course. I love hip-hop.

1523
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:51,821
I even saw your
Bangalore act on YouTube.

1524
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:53,323
It was fab!

1525
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:56,652
Mom, do you know that
Vishnu sir's team...

1526
01:40:56,718 --> 01:40:57,992
is the first Indian team...

1527
01:40:58,252 --> 01:41:00,698
that has qualified for the
semi finals in Las Vegas?

1528
01:41:01,589 --> 01:41:02,966
Yes, it's been all over.

1529
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:04,862
Can I please have a picture with you?

1530
01:41:04,926 --> 01:41:06,530
My friends are gonna burn!

1531
01:41:06,594 --> 01:41:07,868
Come.
- Mom, click fast.

1532
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:53,841
Thank you.

1533
01:41:59,581 --> 01:42:03,256
Ivlanu, Vishnu sir is getting late.

1534
01:42:04,686 --> 01:42:06,495
Thank you, Vishnu sir. Bye.

1535
01:42:23,537 --> 01:42:25,744
Mom, you know him?
- Yes, he's an old friend.

1536
01:42:35,783 --> 01:42:36,761
Vishnu sir...

1537
01:42:44,592 --> 01:42:45,935
India will win, won't it?

1538
01:42:48,462 --> 01:42:49,702
India has already won.

1539
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:53,368
Take care.

1540
01:42:58,272 --> 01:43:00,843
Thank you, Gopi,
for helping me out.

1541
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:02,546
Don't mention it.

1542
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:04,385
You have been waiting to meet Ivlanu
since the last eight years.

1543
01:43:04,913 --> 01:43:05,914
You met him.

1544
01:43:06,447 --> 01:43:07,517
Are you happy now?

1545
01:43:08,750 --> 01:43:09,785
Very!

1546
01:43:15,423 --> 01:43:17,266
Vishnu, our team...

1547
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:18,802
Who is she?

1548
01:43:20,828 --> 01:43:22,808
Looks like there's been a problem.

1549
01:46:06,828 --> 01:46:08,205
Boys, wake up.

1550
01:46:08,829 --> 01:46:11,810
Oh sacred waters!

1551
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,978
You guys will drown in there.
- Raghav, what are you doing?

1552
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:19,650
L-low much fun is this!

1553
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:21,982
What happened?

1554
01:46:23,677 --> 01:46:25,384
Did this happen in the night?

1555
01:46:29,851 --> 01:46:32,661
- There's a hot water spring
that feels like this in l-laridwar...

1556
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:47,875
- We just need some more time.

1557
01:46:47,935 --> 01:46:50,415
No, you got to listen.
You got to get the money together.

1558
01:46:50,471 --> 01:46:51,882
But do you know how
they've come from India'?

1559
01:46:51,939 --> 01:46:52,917
I understand that.
-And I am so...

1560
01:46:53,174 --> 01:46:54,915
I know all that, but listen...
what I'm trying to tell you

1561
01:46:55,175 --> 01:46:56,552
is that it's the rule.

1562
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:58,715
I got to follow them.
You got to follow them. Okay?

1563
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:00,588
Look... You have till 12 o'clock

1564
01:47:00,615 --> 01:47:01,389
to get the money.

1565
01:47:01,449 --> 01:47:01,927
If you don't...

1566
01:47:02,183 --> 01:47:02,854
you just got to go home.

1567
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:03,691
Sir, but we just need one chance.

1568
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:04,627
Stop it.

1569
01:47:04,785 --> 01:47:06,526
You just got to pay up or go home.

1570
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:07,429
Okay.
- I'm sorry.

1571
01:47:07,488 --> 01:47:08,762
Okay.
- Sir, please...

1572
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:11,769
What happened?

1573
01:47:12,793 --> 01:47:14,238
We need to pay the money.

1574
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:15,463
NOW!

1575
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:17,841
What did you say?

1576
01:47:17,898 --> 01:47:21,311
"What have we come here to do?
We have come to dance."

1577
01:47:21,836 --> 01:47:23,941
What have we achieved with all this
dancing? We are broke.

1578
01:47:24,572 --> 01:47:26,483
Plus, we are in a fix with Vishnu sir.

1579
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,349
We trusted him with the money.

1580
01:47:28,409 --> 01:47:29,717
We came here from there...

1581
01:47:29,777 --> 01:47:30,778
only to sit like this?

1582
01:47:31,245 --> 01:47:32,246
Here also...

1583
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:36,489
Guys, we are popular.

1584
01:47:37,184 --> 01:47:38,663
People know we dance well.

1585
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:43,463
If we get a couple of days,
we can raise the money.

1586
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:45,301
Right?

1587
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:48,397
That means even after working so hard
we still have to beg?

1588
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:49,471
Beggars? We are not... that.

1589
01:47:49,530 --> 01:47:53,535
That's not true... jeez...
Of course you guys are beggars.

1590
01:47:53,734 --> 01:47:56,476
That's why you have no
employment problems.

1591
01:47:56,537 --> 01:48:00,178
If you run out of jobs,
there's always begging.

1592
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:03,284
<i>Sum...
- Suru...</i>

1593
01:48:03,344 --> 01:48:04,482
Listen...
- What?

1594
01:48:04,545 --> 01:48:05,649
Please leave us alone.

1595
01:48:06,614 --> 01:48:07,854
I'm requesting you to leave us alone.

1596
01:48:07,915 --> 01:48:10,521
Guys we are here to dance
not to fight.

1597
01:48:10,584 --> 01:48:12,689
Don't touch me...
- Don't you touch her...

1598
01:48:12,753 --> 01:48:13,731
You want to talk...
talk to me.

1599
01:48:13,787 --> 01:48:16,199
<i>Sum. .. Surw.
Reese. ....</i>

1600
01:48:16,257 --> 01:48:17,327
Please guys...

1601
01:48:17,624 --> 01:48:18,830
Move. Sorry.

1602
01:48:20,194 --> 01:48:20,865
Please.

1603
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:23,673
Sorry.

1604
01:48:36,577 --> 01:48:37,612
I was selfish.

1605
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,359
I came here...

1606
01:48:41,749 --> 01:48:43,194
with a vested interest.

1607
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:49,463
For my son Ivlanu.

1608
01:48:50,892 --> 01:48:56,205
But because of you,
I not only got my son...

1609
01:48:57,698 --> 01:48:59,234
but also respect.

1610
01:49:00,268 --> 01:49:03,738
Which I could have
never gained by myself.

1611
01:49:04,371 --> 01:49:09,411
I can't do anything
about the family that left...

1612
01:49:09,777 --> 01:49:11,279
but the family...

1613
01:49:13,414 --> 01:49:14,757
that we have made now...

1614
01:49:16,216 --> 01:49:18,196
I don't want to lose it.

1615
01:49:20,788 --> 01:49:21,732
Sorry. . ..

1616
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:23,825
Sorry.

1617
01:49:25,793 --> 01:49:28,797
Sir, no. Please don't apologize.

1618
01:49:28,929 --> 01:49:30,465
You are our guru.

1619
01:50:05,399 --> 01:50:07,902
So girls... what's up?

1620
01:50:45,306 --> 01:50:47,650
God, I love Bollywood.
- Bollywood dance'? I will teach you...

1621
01:50:47,708 --> 01:50:52,453
Hi, guys. Hi, Indian Stunners.

1622
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:55,957
Hi, Vishnu sir. I am Pooja.
- Hi!

1623
01:50:56,216 --> 01:50:58,662
A big fan of yours
and Indian Stunners.

1624
01:50:59,586 --> 01:51:00,564
Get up.

1625
01:51:01,922 --> 01:51:03,799
Thank you. Thank you.

1626
01:51:04,291 --> 01:51:06,965
Actually, you don't need to
introduce yourselves...

1627
01:51:07,227 --> 01:51:08,672
I know all of you.

1628
01:51:09,396 --> 01:51:12,570
I have been staying in America
since many years.

1629
01:51:12,633 --> 01:51:15,443
I am so happy
to see you guys here.

1630
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,504
I feel so proud to be an Indian.

1631
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,444
Thank you,
- Thank you.

1632
01:51:19,507 --> 01:51:21,987
Actually, I have an Indian restaurant
called Nirvana

1633
01:51:22,743 --> 01:51:26,247
and that has the best
Indian food in Vegas.

1634
01:51:26,747 --> 01:51:29,819
I know you guys must be
dying to have Indian food.

1635
01:51:30,384 --> 01:51:31,226
Will we get Gujarati snacks there?

1636
01:51:31,285 --> 01:51:32,696
Of course.

1637
01:51:32,753 --> 01:51:34,323
So, why don't you come?

1638
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:37,534
Next time.

1639
01:51:37,725 --> 01:51:39,705
Next time.
- Yes.

1640
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:43,367
Oh, please let's go.
Come on. Please.

1641
01:51:43,431 --> 01:51:44,466
You like Indian food?

1642
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:45,601
I love Indian...

1643
01:51:46,633 --> 01:51:48,306
Food. She likes Indian food.

1644
01:51:49,503 --> 01:51:50,311
Sir, let's go.

1645
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:52,247
Please, sir. Let's go. Sir...

1646
01:51:52,306 --> 01:51:55,253
- They might have South Indian food too.
- Come on. There's never a next time.

1647
01:51:55,309 --> 01:51:56,788
Alright!
<i>'</i> Yes!

1648
01:51:57,311 --> 01:51:58,915
- Vernon, go on have some chicken.
Pass it here. Looks yummy!

1649
01:51:58,979 --> 01:52:00,549
- Enjoy, it is a party.
- I know.

1650
01:52:12,326 --> 01:52:13,828
Hi D! Hi, guys.

1651
01:52:13,894 --> 01:52:14,838
Hello...
- How's it going?

1652
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:15,737
Hi.

1653
01:52:15,796 --> 01:52:17,002
Hi, Jack!
- Hi!

1654
01:52:18,299 --> 01:52:19,004
Sir...

1655
01:52:19,466 --> 01:52:20,410
Shall I leave?

1656
01:52:22,636 --> 01:52:23,671
Come.

1657
01:52:25,272 --> 01:52:25,750
Raghav?

1658
01:52:25,806 --> 01:52:26,944
We are going to be over there.

1659
01:52:27,207 --> 01:52:27,651
You guys sit here...

1660
01:52:27,708 --> 01:52:28,812
- We understand...

1661
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:30,916
Come.
- Hi!

1662
01:52:31,912 --> 01:52:32,890
Hey!

1663
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:37,190
Hi!
- Hi.

1664
01:52:37,685 --> 01:52:38,595
Do you work out?

1665
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:40,792
Work out?
- Yes?

1666
01:52:40,854 --> 01:52:42,231
Where is the time?

1667
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:44,736
We rehearse from the morning
until the evening... dancing...

1668
01:52:46,326 --> 01:52:48,431
Okay. Like the saying goes...

1669
01:52:48,495 --> 01:52:52,807
work is worship and
'Pooja' means worship.

1670
01:52:54,468 --> 01:52:55,811
Are you okay?
- Yes.

1671
01:52:55,836 --> 01:52:56,940
Yes?
- Dancing...

1672
01:52:56,970 --> 01:52:58,347
Yes...

1673
01:52:59,807 --> 01:53:00,444
Excuse me...

1674
01:53:00,507 --> 01:53:02,578
Excuse me, you say you are Indian'?

1675
01:53:02,810 --> 01:53:03,550
Yes.

1676
01:53:03,911 --> 01:53:05,481
ls your mother Indian or your father?

1677
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:07,752
Father... why do you ask?

1678
01:53:07,815 --> 01:53:08,816
That is why. ..

1679
01:53:08,882 --> 01:53:09,883
<i>What do you mean, Sum?</i>

1680
01:53:09,917 --> 01:53:12,227
That is why you do
not know how to eat.

1681
01:53:12,453 --> 01:53:15,434
If your mother were Indian,
she would have fed you with her hands.

1682
01:53:15,623 --> 01:53:16,795
You are meant to eat with your hands.

1683
01:53:16,824 --> 01:53:19,236
And the lentils and rice
are to be mixed and eaten.

1684
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:21,440
You want me to put
my hands in the curry?

1685
01:53:21,495 --> 01:53:23,497
You mean, I actually need to
dip my hands in the curry?

1686
01:53:23,564 --> 01:53:25,635
Yes, put your hands in the curry.

1687
01:53:25,699 --> 01:53:27,474
No, let me show you.

1688
01:53:27,868 --> 01:53:28,869
Really.

1689
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:32,843
If you eat with your hands, you will
be able to make right sized...

1690
01:53:34,842 --> 01:53:37,448
You know...
I mean... what's the word...?

1691
01:53:37,644 --> 01:53:38,622
Bite!

1692
01:53:39,913 --> 01:53:41,392
You are smart. Bite.

1693
01:53:41,782 --> 01:53:42,852
No, I am not doing that.

1694
01:53:42,917 --> 01:53:43,657
Take it.
- No. I am sorry.

1695
01:53:43,684 --> 01:53:45,925
Open your mouth. Olive.

1696
01:53:46,186 --> 01:53:46,687
Olive, just try it.

1697
01:53:46,754 --> 01:53:48,529
If she doesn't want it,
why are you forcing her?

1698
01:53:48,556 --> 01:53:49,660
I am only feeding her.

1699
01:53:50,224 --> 01:53:51,328
If she doesn't want it,
why are you forcing her?

1700
01:53:51,392 --> 01:53:52,700
I am not forcing her.
She is a friend.

1701
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:53,602
Suru.

1702
01:53:53,661 --> 01:53:54,537
<i>What Sum?</i>

1703
01:53:54,761 --> 01:53:55,933
What will you do?
- What Will I do’?

1704
01:53:56,197 --> 01:53:57,369
What will you do?
- What Will I do’?

1705
01:53:57,398 --> 01:53:58,877
Tell me, what will you do?

1706
01:53:59,533 --> 01:54:00,375
She bites!

1707
01:54:00,434 --> 01:54:01,879
She's biting me!

1708
01:54:22,756 --> 01:54:27,671
As the wind touches you
I want to touch it

1709
01:54:27,728 --> 01:54:32,700
I don't wanna go on
And make castles in the sand

1710
01:54:32,766 --> 01:54:37,772
If you walk with me
The paths won't be lonely

1711
01:54:37,804 --> 01:54:42,878
I am gonna love you
Like no one ever can...

1712
01:54:43,844 --> 01:54:48,793
l-low long will I be alone'?

1713
01:54:48,849 --> 01:54:53,628
You know I need you by my side!

1714
01:54:53,921 --> 01:54:58,870
Yes! l-low long will I live alone'?

1715
01:54:58,926 --> 01:55:02,430
One thing I have realized...

1716
01:55:02,496 --> 01:55:04,840
If you hold my hand

1717
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:07,572
My world will change

1718
01:55:07,634 --> 01:55:09,841
If you hold my hand

1719
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:12,611
I will have all the joy

1720
01:55:12,673 --> 01:55:14,983
If you hold my hand

1721
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:17,620
My world will blossom

1722
01:55:17,678 --> 01:55:19,680
If you hold my hand

1723
01:55:20,247 --> 01:55:23,592
Oh Baby!
I'll never let you go.

1724
01:55:23,917 --> 01:55:28,423
O O O You calling out for me

1725
01:55:28,489 --> 01:55:32,699
O O O You got me on my knees

1726
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:37,732
If I get you

1727
01:55:37,798 --> 01:55:42,907
I will treat you very dear

1728
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:47,885
Baby, I'll be there for you forever

1729
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:52,754
I have been saying this
Time and again

1730
01:55:53,714 --> 01:55:58,220
If I get you

1731
01:55:58,285 --> 01:56:02,927
I will treat you very dearly

1732
01:56:03,290 --> 01:56:08,205
Baby, I'll be there for you forever

1733
01:56:08,261 --> 01:56:12,767
I have been saying this
Time and again

1734
01:56:14,902 --> 01:56:19,851
You don't know
l-low I need you

1735
01:56:19,873 --> 01:56:24,322
Like a bird that's looking for the sky

1736
01:56:24,978 --> 01:56:29,825
I know what I am without

1737
01:56:30,284 --> 01:56:33,493
Oh Baby!
I'm just another guy!

1738
01:56:33,553 --> 01:56:35,897
If you hold my hand

1739
01:56:35,923 --> 01:56:38,529
My world will change

1740
01:56:38,592 --> 01:56:40,868
If you hold my hand

1741
01:56:40,928 --> 01:56:43,568
I will have all the joy

1742
01:56:43,630 --> 01:56:45,940
If you hold my hand

1743
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,646
My world will blossom

1744
01:56:48,669 --> 01:56:51,206
If you hold my hand

1745
01:56:51,271 --> 01:56:54,514
Oh Baby!
I'll never let you go.

1746
01:56:54,541 --> 01:56:59,422
O O O You calling out for me

1747
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:04,486
O O O You got me on my knees

1748
01:57:04,551 --> 01:57:09,625
O O O You calling out for me

1749
01:57:09,690 --> 01:57:13,900
O O O You got me on my knees,
for life!

1750
01:57:13,961 --> 01:57:16,498
If you hold my hand

1751
01:57:34,748 --> 01:57:35,920
- What a super hit move.

1752
01:57:40,253 --> 01:57:42,790
- Come closer, let me see.

1753
01:57:43,256 --> 01:57:44,633
- It's really funny.
- Oh my God!

1754
01:57:44,891 --> 01:57:46,336
- Raghav has lost it.

1755
01:57:51,197 --> 01:57:52,198
Suru.

1756
01:57:52,332 --> 01:57:53,777
Look at this.

1757
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:54,811
I have shown you twice.

1758
01:57:54,835 --> 01:57:55,870
Two... two minutes.

1759
01:57:56,302 --> 01:57:56,939
One second.

1760
01:57:57,170 --> 01:57:58,274
Come on, Suru.

1761
01:57:58,338 --> 01:57:59,510
What is happening?

1762
01:58:00,307 --> 01:58:01,217
What is happening?

1763
01:58:01,275 --> 01:58:02,913
What are both of you doing?

1764
01:58:03,176 --> 01:58:04,246
<i>Who two?</i>

1765
01:58:04,611 --> 01:58:05,851
You and Olive.

1766
01:58:06,579 --> 01:58:08,616
Vinnie is feeling bad.
Look at her face.

1767
01:58:08,815 --> 01:58:10,260
Vinnie is feeling bad?

1768
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:11,861
Vinnie?

1769
01:58:11,885 --> 01:58:12,863
Don't do all this.

1770
01:58:12,886 --> 01:58:13,887
Where are you taking me?

1771
01:58:13,954 --> 01:58:15,228
Let's clear things right away.

1772
01:58:15,255 --> 01:58:17,701
Vinnie, are you feeling
bad about anything?

1773
01:58:18,859 --> 01:58:19,667
No.

1774
01:58:19,726 --> 01:58:20,704
Vernon is saying that...

1775
01:58:22,462 --> 01:58:24,499
You aren't feeling bad about anything?

1776
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:26,543
No.

1777
01:58:28,135 --> 01:58:30,342
When she feeds him, touches him

1778
01:58:30,404 --> 01:58:32,441
then your face falls.

1779
01:58:32,472 --> 01:58:34,383
Now that he is in front of you,
tell him.

1780
01:58:34,708 --> 01:58:35,584
Tell me, Vinnie.

1781
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,254
Tell him.

1782
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:37,380
He is just talking rubbish.

1783
01:58:37,444 --> 01:58:38,821
What is wrong with you!

1784
01:58:39,512 --> 01:58:41,583
Listen... you go to Olive.

1785
01:58:41,648 --> 01:58:43,491
I am going to Olive.
- Just a minute. Wait.

1786
01:58:43,650 --> 01:58:44,253
You go.

1787
01:58:44,284 --> 01:58:45,786
- Now I should go?

1788
01:58:46,720 --> 01:58:47,460
What are you showing her?

1789
01:58:47,521 --> 01:58:49,262
Wait two minutes. Let me show her.

1790
01:58:49,456 --> 01:58:50,764
Who are you showing it to?
- What happened?

1791
01:58:50,824 --> 01:58:52,303
Something personal between them.
I don't know.

1792
01:58:52,492 --> 01:58:53,698
Yes! I am feeling bad...

1793
01:58:54,628 --> 01:58:56,369
that you two are getting close,
unnecessarily.

1794
01:58:56,396 --> 01:58:57,602
Why are you feeding her?

1795
01:58:58,932 --> 01:58:59,876
Feeding her...

1796
01:58:59,933 --> 01:59:02,277
We are rehearsing, so there is
bound to be contact.

1797
01:59:02,302 --> 01:59:03,610
Is this how rehearsals are done'?

1798
01:59:03,670 --> 01:59:04,876
What are you doing?
Everyone's watching.

1799
01:59:05,372 --> 01:59:06,407
Let them see!

1800
01:59:07,407 --> 01:59:09,546
I am not in love with her.

1801
01:59:09,576 --> 01:59:12,489
Why didn't you tell me if
you have feelings for me?

1802
01:59:12,546 --> 01:59:15,493
It is obvious to everyone.

1803
01:59:15,515 --> 01:59:17,392
Even Vinod can see it.
Why can't you?

1804
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:18,827
No I can't. I'm blind!

1805
01:59:18,852 --> 01:59:20,957
Why don't you tell me?

1806
01:59:21,388 --> 01:59:22,332
Say it.

1807
01:59:22,355 --> 01:59:23,527
Do...

1808
01:59:24,258 --> 01:59:25,635
Do I need to tell you?

1809
01:59:31,331 --> 01:59:32,571
Why are you getting worked up?

1810
01:59:34,567 --> 01:59:35,739
You...

1811
01:59:37,237 --> 01:59:38,375
You know that...

1812
01:59:46,913 --> 01:59:49,291
You'll make her cry!

1813
01:59:49,349 --> 01:59:50,419
Hey, Suru...

1814
02:00:56,549 --> 02:00:57,493
Hold up!

1815
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:01,862
For the first time in the history of
the World Starz hip-hop challenge...

1816
02:01:01,888 --> 02:01:03,390
two teams have the same points

1817
02:01:03,423 --> 02:01:05,903
but there's only
one spot in the finals.

1818
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:09,263
This means they will be battling
it out tonight in a dance off.

1819
02:01:09,329 --> 02:01:13,607
This is huge for India as the
Philippine All Stars are their idols.

1820
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:20,245
So, here we are finally
at the face off in Las Vegas.

1821
02:01:20,307 --> 02:01:22,548
And everybody is asking me
who my favorite is.

1822
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:24,748
You know what...
both teams are my favourite.

1823
02:01:24,811 --> 02:01:27,690
First up, let's see what
the Philippine All Stars got for us.

1824
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:45,436
That was amazing!

1825
02:02:48,928 --> 02:02:50,498
Come on boys... come on.

1826
02:02:51,298 --> 02:02:52,242
What happened?

1827
02:02:52,632 --> 02:02:54,771
Sir, they are very good.

1828
02:02:55,335 --> 02:02:56,473
Sir... how will we...

1829
02:02:56,703 --> 02:02:58,307
They are like our Gods.

1830
02:02:58,972 --> 02:03:01,384
I mean...
- They are not real Gods.

1831
02:03:01,908 --> 02:03:04,616
Now you dance for the real One.

1832
02:03:05,645 --> 02:03:12,255
You won't dance for them but
only for those, who look out for you.

1833
02:03:12,619 --> 02:03:13,723
Come on, Suru!

1834
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:15,263
DO it!

1835
02:03:18,225 --> 02:03:24,574
Let's go for it!!

1836
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:38,253
O Supreme Being!
Without you...

1837
02:03:38,311 --> 02:03:42,953
O Divinity
I am lost

1838
02:03:43,216 --> 02:03:47,790
O Supreme Being!
Without you...

1839
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:52,633
O Divinity
I am lost

1840
02:03:52,692 --> 02:03:57,402
My dreams started taking shape

1841
02:03:57,464 --> 02:04:02,743
Shattered before it came true

1842
02:04:05,272 --> 02:04:13,282
My tasks are incomplete.
Please guide me.

1843
02:04:16,616 --> 02:04:26,230
Hail and salute you

1844
02:04:26,259 --> 02:04:35,907
Hail and salute you

1845
02:05:09,502 --> 02:05:11,880
Supreme Lord
The Lord known by many names

1846
02:05:11,938 --> 02:05:14,919
The one in many forms
Who wears the moon on his forehead

1847
02:05:19,212 --> 02:05:21,590
Supreme Lord
The Lord known by many names

1848
02:05:21,648 --> 02:05:23,889
The one in many forms
Who wears the moon on his forehead

1849
02:05:23,950 --> 02:05:26,396
The creators of the universe
All sing your praises

1850
02:05:26,453 --> 02:05:29,696
Superior Lord, the sky echoes
With the melodies of the percussion

1851
02:05:47,907 --> 02:05:52,583
Oh Lord!
This life is transient

1852
02:05:52,645 --> 02:05:56,718
It burns and melts in an instant

1853
02:05:56,750 --> 02:06:02,257
Oh Lord!
I am like a flickering lamp

1854
02:06:02,322 --> 02:06:06,737
My morale has started dwindling

1855
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:09,531
Hope my steps don't halt

1856
02:06:09,563 --> 02:06:16,845
What will happen if the head
that has never bowed down

1857
02:06:21,841 --> 02:06:25,687
Hail and salute you

1858
02:06:25,745 --> 02:06:30,922
Hail and salute you

1859
02:06:31,184 --> 02:06:35,724
Hail and salute you

1860
02:06:35,788 --> 02:06:40,737
Hail and salute you

1861
02:06:59,312 --> 02:07:03,283
Oh Lord
Hail the enlightened one!

1862
02:07:03,350 --> 02:07:05,626
A potent mantra
I chant this mantra

1863
02:07:05,651 --> 02:07:07,324
I respect your power

1864
02:07:07,387 --> 02:07:11,358
Everything starts with you
And ends with you

1865
02:07:11,424 --> 02:07:15,338
Truth, Life and Virtue
Hail the enlightened one!

1866
02:07:15,394 --> 02:07:17,396
Oh valorous Lord
Brave one

1867
02:07:17,430 --> 02:07:19,307
Nurturer of the helpless

1868
02:07:19,365 --> 02:07:23,336
Remover of hurdles
Creator as well as the destroyer

1869
02:07:23,403 --> 02:07:27,180
Provider of clear vision
The strongest being in the Universe

1870
02:07:27,207 --> 02:07:31,155
A potent mantra
I chant this mantra

1871
02:07:31,177 --> 02:07:34,647
I respect your power

1872
02:07:57,170 --> 02:08:00,447
Hey, we have made it to the finals.

1873
02:08:00,507 --> 02:08:03,716
We made it to the finals!
We won. We won. VVon...

1874
02:08:10,183 --> 02:08:10,718
Hey...

1875
02:08:10,784 --> 02:08:11,455
Come.

1876
02:08:11,517 --> 02:08:14,191
I had gone for two minutes.
They beat me again. Look.

1877
02:08:14,254 --> 02:08:15,756
Look at them. Come on. No.

1878
02:08:19,292 --> 02:08:20,635
What are you doing, D?

1879
02:08:20,893 --> 02:08:21,928
They are hitting me.
What are you doing?

1880
02:08:22,195 --> 02:08:23,265
You know how to slap, don't you'?

1881
02:08:23,763 --> 02:08:25,538
Then why did you wait
to be slapped four times?

1882
02:08:25,765 --> 02:08:27,608
Why didn't you hit me back
on the first one? Come.

1883
02:08:34,807 --> 02:08:35,444
Hey!

1884
02:08:41,447 --> 02:08:45,395
Stop. Stop. Calm down.

1885
02:08:45,651 --> 02:08:47,460
What happened?
- He slapped me.

1886
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:48,396
He did?
- Yes.

1887
02:08:48,455 --> 02:08:50,162
Then hit him back!

1888
02:09:04,170 --> 02:09:07,447
Stop! Stop! Get up!

1889
02:09:07,507 --> 02:09:10,317
Now! Stop... Stop it!

1890
02:09:10,376 --> 02:09:13,482
Come on. Separate. Separate.

1891
02:09:13,913 --> 02:09:17,326
Get over there. Stop!
Take your breath.

1892
02:09:17,484 --> 02:09:18,462
Everybody.

1893
02:09:18,718 --> 02:09:21,426
I won't have this violence
in my competition.

1894
02:09:21,487 --> 02:09:22,488
You get it?

1895
02:09:22,555 --> 02:09:25,832
I spent ten years getting this garbage
out of hip-hop.

1896
02:09:26,259 --> 02:09:28,933
We won't go back.
Do you understand?

1897
02:09:29,195 --> 02:09:29,764
Yes.

1898
02:09:29,829 --> 02:09:32,537
Do you understand?
Say, 'yes'.

1899
02:09:32,598 --> 02:09:33,406
Yes.

1900
02:09:34,667 --> 02:09:36,704
Your team! Your team!

1901
02:09:36,769 --> 02:09:38,442
You have one more chance.

1902
02:09:38,504 --> 02:09:41,383
You do it again,
you are out of the competition.

1903
02:09:42,308 --> 02:09:44,310
You boys want to show your muscle?

1904
02:09:44,377 --> 02:09:47,221
You show it out there.
Not here.

1905
02:09:48,248 --> 02:09:50,489
Now get out of here.
- Yes, sir!

1906
02:09:50,550 --> 02:09:53,656
Now, go!
Move!

1907
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:55,824
Boys...

1908
02:09:57,289 --> 02:09:58,563
look our Suresh and Vernon.

1909
02:09:58,624 --> 02:10:00,433
Indian Stunners deserve it better.

1910
02:10:00,493 --> 02:10:03,269
This is their first time
but they did super duper great.

1911
02:10:03,563 --> 02:10:05,975
They deserve this because
I know it is from their heart.

1912
02:10:06,232 --> 02:10:07,711
Suresh?
- They know what they want to do.

1913
02:10:07,767 --> 02:10:11,647
To actually show the love for dance
and hip-hop in the whole wide world.

1914
02:10:11,704 --> 02:10:14,412
It is their first time.
But... respect.

1915
02:10:14,473 --> 02:10:15,713
Indian Stunners!

1916
02:10:18,611 --> 02:10:22,957
Victory to India!

1917
02:10:25,885 --> 02:10:27,956
One... two...

1918
02:10:28,221 --> 02:10:29,359
- Guys, hold on.

1919
02:10:29,388 --> 02:10:30,560
Three...

1920
02:10:33,826 --> 02:10:36,306
Jack, come.
- Wait, where are you going?

1921
02:10:37,396 --> 02:10:38,466
Thank you.

1922
02:10:39,432 --> 02:10:40,536
L-low are you doing now'?

1923
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:42,307
L-low is your foot'?
- Okay.

1924
02:10:42,869 --> 02:10:43,711
Sit.

1925
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:45,578
It is better than before.

1926
02:10:46,872 --> 02:10:48,818
It is better now. Thanks.

1927
02:10:49,942 --> 02:10:51,478
Listen, Vinnie...

1928
02:10:52,878 --> 02:10:54,482
I just didn't know...

1929
02:10:55,715 --> 02:10:59,322
I mean, that you and Suru...

1930
02:10:59,618 --> 02:11:00,688
I mean...

1931
02:11:01,554 --> 02:11:02,999
were childhood friends.

1932
02:11:03,857 --> 02:11:05,894
And I unnecessarily came in between.

1933
02:11:07,393 --> 02:11:09,532
I am sorry I got carried away.

1934
02:11:12,265 --> 02:11:13,573
I am the one who should apologize.

1935
02:11:14,267 --> 02:11:15,678
Suru is like that.

1936
02:11:15,702 --> 02:11:17,579
Everyone falls in love with him.

1937
02:11:19,372 --> 02:11:20,009
Thanks, Vinnie.

1938
02:11:20,273 --> 02:11:22,344
I just wanted to clear this.

1939
02:11:22,609 --> 02:11:24,589
I was your replacement here.

1940
02:11:24,644 --> 02:11:26,851
And now, when you get okay...

1941
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:29,920
before I go,
I wanted to tell you everything.

1942
02:11:30,283 --> 02:11:31,694
Before you go?

1943
02:11:31,751 --> 02:11:33,230
Where are you going to go?

1944
02:11:33,553 --> 02:11:36,295
We have reached here because of you.

1945
02:11:36,556 --> 02:11:39,400
And when we move ahead in
the competition, you will be with us.

1946
02:11:39,692 --> 02:11:41,535
You are a part of Indian Stunners now.

1947
02:11:41,828 --> 02:11:43,933
Yes.
- Yes... Yes!

1948
02:12:16,362 --> 02:12:17,739
From the disgraced copycats...

1949
02:12:17,863 --> 02:12:19,274
to the meek underdogs.

1950
02:12:19,332 --> 02:12:22,779
For the first time India takes part
in such an international arena...

1951
02:12:22,835 --> 02:12:24,542
and is now at the top!

1952
02:12:24,603 --> 02:12:26,310
Making us so proud of them.

1953
02:12:34,547 --> 02:12:36,891
I would always tell him...
that he's a winner!

1954
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:38,759
Just do it! Move aheadl!

1955
02:12:39,218 --> 02:12:39,855
Look at him now.

1956
02:12:39,919 --> 02:12:42,900
Blessings to Team Indian Stunners.

1957
02:12:52,932 --> 02:12:56,311
They defeated the same team
they had copied from.

1958
02:12:56,369 --> 02:12:59,907
Amazing! They made us proud.
So, Indian Stunners... go for it!

1959
02:12:59,973 --> 02:13:01,384
Well done Indian Stunners...

1960
02:13:01,407 --> 02:13:03,546
All the very best...
make India proud.

1961
02:13:12,551 --> 02:13:16,761
We are the youth of Punjab...

1962
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:20,562
Wherever we live... India or America

1963
02:13:20,626 --> 02:13:24,438
If we dance the l-lip-l-lop
or the Bangra...

1964
02:13:24,497 --> 02:13:28,206
We'll will win every battle!

1965
02:13:42,414 --> 02:13:44,655
We are right in the middle
of the Grand Finale...

1966
02:13:44,717 --> 02:13:47,698
of the World Starz Hip Hop Challenge.

1967
02:13:47,753 --> 02:13:51,895
Let me hear you make some noise!

1968
02:13:51,958 --> 02:13:54,336
Louder!

1969
02:13:54,393 --> 02:13:56,873
Are we ready for the next performance'?

1970
02:13:57,696 --> 02:13:58,834
Alright!

1971
02:14:47,313 --> 02:14:49,452
Right next... we got Team Recycle.

1972
02:14:49,515 --> 02:14:50,755
Defending champions...

1973
02:14:50,816 --> 02:14:53,695
Let me see you...
All the way from Germany!

1974
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:52,205
No contest is complete
without an underdog story...

1975
02:16:52,538 --> 02:16:53,949
And in this contest...

1976
02:16:54,206 --> 02:16:57,244
I think we got one of the finest
underdog stories we ever had.

1977
02:16:57,777 --> 02:17:02,590
These guys coming up next are
in this contest for the first time!

1978
02:17:02,715 --> 02:17:05,787
putting their country
on the hip hop map!

1979
02:17:06,285 --> 02:17:09,357
First time in the contest
they go through the qualifiers...

1980
02:17:09,422 --> 02:17:10,901
Go through the quarters...

1981
02:17:10,956 --> 02:17:15,735
go through the semis where
they had to face their inspiration...

1982
02:17:15,795 --> 02:17:19,299
- The Philippine All Stars in a dance off!
- Let's do this!

1983
02:17:19,632 --> 02:17:22,238
- And now... raring to go...

1984
02:17:22,301 --> 02:17:23,803
Hey you! Indian Stunners, right?

1985
02:17:23,869 --> 02:17:25,371
Go! Go! Go!

1986
02:17:25,437 --> 02:17:26,472
Come on, boys!

1987
02:17:26,839 --> 02:17:27,749
Come on, Suru!

1988
02:17:27,807 --> 02:17:29,252
Come on, boys!

1989
02:17:29,742 --> 02:17:31,221
Come on, everyone!

1990
02:17:32,745 --> 02:17:33,849
What happened?

1991
02:17:40,753 --> 02:17:45,668
Only your name stands for the truth

1992
02:17:51,630 --> 02:17:57,308
Only your name is the truth

1993
02:17:57,369 --> 02:18:01,613
And calls out your name dear Mother!

1994
02:18:02,208 --> 02:18:07,920
You are my identity

1995
02:18:08,180 --> 02:18:11,457
My world, my Mother!

1996
02:18:12,751 --> 02:18:17,791
I will put my life on the line
For you a hundred times

1997
02:18:18,424 --> 02:18:23,373
I will put my life on the line
For you a hundred times

1998
02:18:23,562 --> 02:18:27,567
I can sacrifice anything
for you, Mother!

1999
02:18:30,536 --> 02:18:35,610
Mother, I salute thee!

2000
02:18:36,142 --> 02:18:41,319
Mother, I salute thee!

2001
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:46,420
Mother, I salute thee!

2002
02:18:46,652 --> 02:18:51,897
Mother, I salute thee!

2003
02:19:03,269 --> 02:19:05,271
The biggest moment of my life

2004
02:19:05,337 --> 02:19:07,817
Yes! Just a few steps away

2005
02:19:07,873 --> 02:19:09,614
Yes! I have been waiting for so long

2006
02:19:09,675 --> 02:19:10,745
For this evening

2007
02:19:10,809 --> 02:19:13,517
Now, watch what he will do

2008
02:19:13,579 --> 02:19:16,253
Who bows down to none

2009
02:19:16,315 --> 02:19:19,228
Sit and enjoy

2010
02:19:19,285 --> 02:19:21,731
Even if I walk straight

2011
02:19:21,787 --> 02:19:24,427
I am a sure shot winner

2012
02:19:24,489 --> 02:19:26,935
I am indebted to my motherland

2013
02:19:27,192 --> 02:19:29,798
I will defeat and win over you

2014
02:19:29,862 --> 02:19:32,433
Whatever I have promised

2015
02:19:32,498 --> 02:19:34,978
I am from India

2016
02:19:35,234 --> 02:19:37,771
Hold on tight I am coming
with my might To fight and conquer

2017
02:19:37,803 --> 02:19:40,443
Wherever you have come from,
Whomever you may be

2018
02:19:40,506 --> 02:19:42,986
My conquest will take place right here

2019
02:19:43,241 --> 02:19:48,247
I will put our flag of victory there.

2020
02:20:16,274 --> 02:20:18,754
Whether I win or lose

2021
02:20:18,810 --> 02:20:21,484
I will show you

2022
02:20:21,547 --> 02:20:24,255
Mother is my Lord

2023
02:20:24,316 --> 02:20:26,728
There is no other shrine

2024
02:20:26,785 --> 02:20:29,425
I will dance,
I am crazed

2025
02:20:29,488 --> 02:20:32,196
I will dance,
My heart is helpless

2026
02:20:32,257 --> 02:20:34,703
This evening

2027
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:37,297
My Mother will watch

2028
02:20:37,362 --> 02:20:39,842
Whether I win or lose

2029
02:20:39,898 --> 02:20:42,708
My Mother will be watching

2030
02:20:43,969 --> 02:20:45,607
I have to dance

2031
02:20:46,571 --> 02:20:47,914
I have to dance

2032
02:20:48,273 --> 02:20:49,308
Mother

2033
02:20:49,375 --> 02:20:50,718
I have to dance

2034
02:20:50,775 --> 02:20:54,279
My Mother will be watching

2035
02:20:54,480 --> 02:21:00,362
Saffron like the valour

2036
02:21:00,886 --> 02:21:06,393
Green like tender blossoms

2037
02:21:08,260 --> 02:21:13,505
White like clean intentions

2038
02:21:14,766 --> 02:21:20,011
These three colours are
Dearer than life itself

2039
02:21:21,006 --> 02:21:26,456
These three colours are
Dearer than life itself

2040
02:21:27,512 --> 02:21:32,552
My Mother's colour

2041
02:21:32,617 --> 02:21:34,790
Of every good

2042
02:21:34,853 --> 02:21:37,424
Mother, Mother, Mother

2043
02:21:37,789 --> 02:21:40,599
Colour of your tradition

2044
02:21:40,658 --> 02:21:43,298
Colour of your beloved

2045
02:21:43,361 --> 02:21:48,538
Colour of your victory

2046
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:51,308
l-low can I repay

2047
02:21:51,369 --> 02:21:53,849
Your debt

2048
02:21:53,905 --> 02:21:58,752
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

2049
02:21:59,344 --> 02:22:04,589
Until my last breath

2050
02:22:04,649 --> 02:22:10,224
Fluttering in your
warmth and affection

2051
02:22:10,288 --> 02:22:14,759
Only your name stands for the truth

2052
02:22:19,765 --> 02:22:28,412
Mother, I salute thee!

2053
02:22:36,381 --> 02:22:41,660
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2054
02:22:41,853 --> 02:22:47,701
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2055
02:22:49,628 --> 02:22:55,306
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2056
02:22:55,367 --> 02:23:00,544
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2057
02:23:00,839 --> 02:23:06,790
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2058
02:23:17,422 --> 02:23:23,429
O Mother

2059
02:23:28,767 --> 02:23:33,477
O Mother

2060
02:24:52,651 --> 02:24:57,657
Only your name stands for the truth

2061
02:25:54,412 --> 02:25:59,521
Let's go for it!!

2062
02:26:48,266 --> 02:26:53,739
Glory of moonlight dreams

2063
02:26:53,805 --> 02:26:59,221
Over thy branches and lordly streams

2064
02:26:59,277 --> 02:27:06,593
Clad in thy blossoming trees

2065
02:27:09,754 --> 02:27:12,462
Laughing low and sweet

2066
02:27:12,523 --> 02:27:18,201
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2067
02:27:18,263 --> 02:27:23,508
Rich with thy hurrying streams
Bright with orchard gleams

2068
02:27:32,644 --> 02:27:38,617
Victory!

2069
02:27:39,785 --> 02:27:44,256
O Victory to thee!

2070
02:27:48,260 --> 02:27:50,240
Whenever I would hurt
myself as a child...

2071
02:27:50,561 --> 02:27:51,767
my mother would say...

2072
02:27:52,497 --> 02:27:54,204
take your next step carefully.

2073
02:27:55,366 --> 02:27:57,642
You should always focus
on the next step.

2074
02:28:00,505 --> 02:28:02,883
We couldn't win the
competition at Vegas...

2075
02:28:03,708 --> 02:28:05,619
but we definitely learned...

2076
02:28:05,943 --> 02:28:08,253
that every effort made in truth...

2077
02:28:08,613 --> 02:28:10,752
is greater than winning or losing.

2078
02:28:12,517 --> 02:28:14,793
And every step in
the right direction...

2079
02:28:14,853 --> 02:28:16,833
is a goal in itself.

2080
02:28:19,691 --> 02:28:20,965
After all...

2081
02:28:21,559 --> 02:28:23,436
life is all about the next step.
