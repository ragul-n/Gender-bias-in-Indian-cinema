1
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,831
Los Angeles, 12th May, 2000.

2
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,002
The place where we six
rogues met for the first time.

3
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,608
We had thought that we
would win over the world..

4
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,611
..but we got screwed instead.

5
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,628
Aiiu.. It was his plan.

6
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:39,803
We all have to go to hell one day.
Do this job and you'll go in a..

7
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,972
..big car else
you'll have to go walking.

8
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,978
You can keep your big car.
l prefer walking.

9
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,980
lt's better than
going on four shoulders.

10
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,982
Hey stutterer,
try to understand.

11
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:58,989
Bali.. Sports a earring,
abusive in nature and pea-brained.

12
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,822
You're trying to
make me understand?

13
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:04,827
Do you think this is some
cooperative bank in Kolhapur?

14
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,600
You will walk in and point a gun at
the guard, and he will intimate the..

15
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:15,273
..cashier, who in turn, will gift-wrap
all the money and give it to you..

16
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:20,512
..saying, Happy birthday,
sir! This is America, ass!

17
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,611
Within two minutes,
you'll be brought back here..

18
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,615
..and you'll be
celebrating your birthday here.

19
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,281
Bali had uttered
words of wisdom for the..

20
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:30,620
..first and the last time in his life.
- Trying to make me understand!

21
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,625
Maior. Only Maior or his past
knew why everyone called him..

22
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:39,295
..Maior. But our
present was dearer to us.

23
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,298
Maior said.. - Aiiu is right. - Hell!
We'll have to come back here..

24
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:47,304
..whether we take
the right or the left.

25
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:51,642
Hey chicken! You're right.
- Yes, l'm right.

26
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:55,479
l'll send for you when
l've to burgle a poultry farm.

27
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,650
Chicken stealer! - Hey don't call me
chicken.. - l won't call you that.

28
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,652
l understood.
- Yes.

29
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,489
Hey! What do you say?

30
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:10,594
And this is me,
l'm always thinking.

31
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,927
But now, l feel why l didn't
think about it at that time.

32
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,930
l'll think about
it and let you know.

33
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,764
What'll be my share?

34
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,600
Andy, he had done his
masters in software development.

35
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,570
His consent was necessary for
the development of this plan.

36
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,776
As much as you can handle.
- But how much?

37
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,612
The question isn't : How much
liqueur is there in the bar?

38
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,280
The question is :
How much can you drink?

39
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,452
And what about the cop?

40
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,787
Mark, he was a bouncer in a
club. From there he bounced here..

41
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,789
..directly, amidst us.

42
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,793
He'll come in our way only when
he comes to know about our plan.

43
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,795
And by the time he
comes to know about it..

44
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,364
You would've opened a dance
bar in Mumbai along with your..

45
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,303
..girl. And we six would come
there to see your girl dance.

46
00:03:54,801 --> 00:04:02,650
Hey Aiiu! Enough! Don't
say anything else about her.

47
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:10,591
Hey Mark! l'm scared!
See, my hands are shivering.

48
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,760
What if the police comes?
- They won't.

49
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,929
What if they do?
- Then we'll send them back.

50
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,503
Can't we do anything else?
Something which is less risky?

51
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,770
Fortune wants to
warm your bed for you..

52
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,606
..and you want to
sleep on the couch!

53
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:36,616
Fortune is that whore who
doesn't sleep with me. Understood?

54
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:44,624
Fortune! If any one of us
tries to make our fortune..

55
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,955
..then these
people won't let us.

56
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,628
lf someone is
killed somewhere, then..

57
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,630
..these people nab us.

58
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,966
lf there's a theft anywhere,
then our houses are searched first.

59
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:02,804
The Italians have their mafia.

60
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,807
The Colombians
have their cantles.

61
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,976
The Chinese have their triunes.

62
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,580
And all these are so
organized that no policeman..

63
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,717
..can ever dare to
knock at their doors.

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:22,728
And we.. we Indians,
what do we have? Nothing.

65
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,662
Nothing but police records.

66
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,603
lf even a blind man sees
something at a distance..

67
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,771
..of 400mts, he says,
'That must be an Indian# 

68
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,941
And these people nab
us and bring us here.

69
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,781
At a distance of 400mts, even
an elephant looks like a hammer.

70
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,788
We are made to wear
the turban of crime..

71
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,626
..and we'll be made to
wear it as long as..

72
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,635
..we don't have
money to buy innocence.

73
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,803
Maior was a good speaker.
Had he spoken on screen..

74
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,705
..then he would've
received an Oscar.

75
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,575
He spoke here and
received a bullet.

76
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:19,250
Maior made all of us think.
- Think about it.

77
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,917
We still have time.
- And a plan as well.

78
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,588
Alright! You're free for now.

79
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,262
lf the bell tolls in
any one of your heads..

80
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:37,601
..then come to club Niagara
tonight. l'll wait for you there.

81
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:42,774
We.. we'll wait for you there.

82
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,828
Had l not been there, then
you would've gone out hungry.

83
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,762
You got up from the bed again!

84
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,766
Sometimes l feel that
you like me to scold you.

85
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:01,538
ls there anything that
l don't like in you?

86
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,774
Yes. Why did you leave
the bed? C'mon! C'mon!

87
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,610
Yes, give me that.
Give me that plate.

88
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,947
You stayed awake all night
again, isn't it? - Yes.

89
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,283
l had to prepare
the project report.

90
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,621
But now, it's enough. l've
stayed awake many a nights.

91
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:24,294
Now l believe those
people will like my work.

92
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,963
We'll get money and then we
can go back to our country.

93
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,802
Maybe the doctors there..
- Can pe_orm that miracle..

94
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,806
..which none of the
Americans doctors could.

95
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,980
l know that l don't have enough
time to listen to your scolding.

96
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:51,657
The only gratifying thought is
that l'll be able to close my..

97
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,655
..eyes for the last
time in the land..

98
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,490
..where l had opened them first.

99
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:01,498
You shouldn't say such things.
Nothing will happen.

100
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:22,622
Please! l'm very old in this
business. l can pay back. Please!

101
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:30,627
What's this? What'll l
do with this, buffalo?

102
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,630
You calf of an elephant! Bull!
Will l clean myself with this?

103
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,634
What'll l do?
- Now what's this guy saying?

104
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,970
l'm saying, Milord, this
isn't enough. l want more.

105
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,641
l have got more customers.
More..

106
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,712
l don't trust your ass, man.
- Please! Please!

107
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,646
You bearded dog, please give me.

108
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,314
You know how much
this is worth, brother.

109
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,986
l know, l'll give you
three times.. four times more.

110
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,655
Please! Please, baldy!

111
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:13,270
Hey buffalo! You rhino, tell
this buffalo to remove this.

112
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,542
lt scares the hell
out of me. Tell him!

113
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,774
You don't pay that back,
man, you're dead!

114
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:24,614
Dead as a duck!
Don't worry, idiot!

115
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:30,288
Nine out of ten times, Bali's
blabbering got us into some..

116
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,788
..mess or the other but
we were lucky this time.

117
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:37,628
How did l fool that fatso?
- You're such an idiot.

118
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,293
You abuse him like anything.
Buffalo.. Goat..-

119
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,628
But he doesn't understand.

120
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,631
What if he does? - If he had
understood then we would've..

121
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,298
..been dead meat by now.

122
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,635
Hey police! Police! Run! Run!

123
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:55,310
Open that window!
Open that window!

124
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,546
Throw it, dog!

125
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:03,820
Game's over, guys! - l've
thrown it! l've thrown it!

126
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:07,657
Cut the shit! Where's
the truck? - What truck?

127
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,591
ls this about a truck? - Is
there something else you want to..

128
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:13,764
..talk to me about?
- No! No! - Shut the hell up!

129
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:21,775
Where's my truck? - Your truck partner
is there, there and there.

130
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:25,607
Let's get these guys out.

131
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:51,803
Lose your crazy heart to me..
Lose your crazy heart to me..

132
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,811
When has the heart
followed our orders?

133
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:07,318
There's always
chaos in this heart..

134
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:10,586
He'll steal my gaze,
he'll lock me in his heart..

135
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,588
..will this ever happen?
No.. no..

136
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:17,929
Lose your crazy heart to me..
Lose your crazy heart to me..

137
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:28,940
These rosy cheeks of mine
are trying to trap you..

138
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,272
The trap of
these golden hair..

139
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,276
..the eyes that
are watching you.

140
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,281
How'll you escape and save
yourself? This won't happen..

141
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,780
..No.. no..

142
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:44,622
Lose your crazy heart to me..
Lose your crazy heart to me..

143
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,635
Stop! Stop!

144
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,306
Stop!

145
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:11,415
You created trouble again!
You're fired!

146
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:14,249
Because l take my iob
very seriously, is it?

147
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,587
Not seriously, because you
take your job very personally.

148
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,588
That guinea
bastard was touching her.

149
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,257
Stop! Stop!

150
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,760
l need this bastard as
well as many such bastards.

151
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:27,262
Otherwise will l drink all
the whisky in this club myself?

152
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,932
l need customers! Stop! Stop!

153
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:33,603
Do you know the
job of a bouncer?

154
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,773
He's supposed to keep the
customers away from the girls.

155
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,609
Not break their bones. Do you
understand that? You're fired!

156
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:46,620
Shut up, Cyrus! - You're fired!
Throw him out! - Fuck you, Cyrus!

157
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,286
lt's alright! It's ok! It's
alright! This is the best club.

158
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,621
C'mon, guys! Have a great time!

159
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,740
Three hours ago, a truck full
of lockup disappeared from..

160
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:14,243
..highway thirteen. We have a
feeling you could tell us about it.

161
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,244
What are you talking about?

162
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,747
l've been working here for
the past six hours, damn it.

163
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:22,919
Ask him. - Why are you lying?
He's lying. He wasn't here.

164
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,753
He's lying. He wasn't here.

165
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,757
Goodbye! Goodbye!

166
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,779
Excuse me! l'm
here to see Mr. Adler.

167
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,948
l'm afraid he
hasn't come in yet.

168
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:01,625
l'm here to see Mr. Rubric.
- Mr. Rubric, you've a visitor.

169
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,792
Down the hall.

170
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,233
Ma'am! - Sir, l'm sorry Mr.
Adler is in a meeting.

171
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,234
Perhaps you would like
to try again next week.

172
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:18,742
O Mr. Adler! Sir, l
won't take much of your time.

173
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:23,581
l won't beat around the bush.
We can't do business with you.

174
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,581
Your background is so..

175
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,583
Look, Mr. Adler,
l'll explain to you.

176
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,250
The board won't listen to me.
l really cannot convince them.

177
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:33,256
l'm very sorry. - Sir!
Excuse me! Mr. Adler! Sir!

178
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:37,593
Mr. Adler, see. l've
given up all those things.

179
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,595
l've started life anew. In
the past ten months of my new..

180
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,499
..life l've developed
this new business plan.

181
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,934
l can bet on anything that
your board won't ignore this..

182
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:48,270
..business plan. According
to this plan, listen to me..

183
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:53,277
..70/o of the market, packaged
Indian food, will be in your..

184
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,280
..pocket in the first quarter.
l have the capability to work hard.

185
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:03,622
l've courage.. the nerve.. l
just need your support and faith.

186
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,621
Ok, your idea is interesting.
Why don't you meet me..

187
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,623
..at my office
tomorrow morning at 9am.

188
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:12,564
Ok. l'll..
- Time to go, Major. Let's go.

189
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,563
ls anything wrong, officer?
- When was it ever right?

190
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:16,565
Let's go, Maior.
- But..

191
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:36,579
Hey! Mcguiry wants to see you.
- Why me?

192
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:38,913
You can ask him yourself
at the station. Let's go.

193
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:49,258
Hey you, Blondie. You're next.

194
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,598
As far as me and
Bali were concerned..

195
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:59,768
..all our stories
had three facets to it.

196
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:05,777
One was mine, the other his
and the third was the truth!

197
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:14,622
Hey guys! Did Bali
tell you how we came here?

198
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:21,792
For the sake of Biryani.
He came home early morning..

199
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:24,961
..saying that his uncle was
making Biryani at his place.

200
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,968
Forget home-made Biryani, his
uncle fed us burgers instead.

201
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,636
That too from MacDonald's.

202
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,974
As soon as we came out, we met
Mcguiry and we are here now.

203
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,815
Are you getting bored?
After that..

204
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,493
You, sir, let it be.

205
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,558
Are you going to tell
me where the truck is?

206
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:34,397
What truck are you talking
about, man? - The truck you stole.

207
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:37,567
Stole!? Do l look
like a thief to you?

208
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:43,409
Yes, you do. - Tell him! l
had been there to meet Rosy.

209
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,740
She stays on the twelfth floor.
Rosy! Tell him.

210
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,074
You tell him.

211
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,745
l went to meet Rosy.
Big boobs Rosy.

212
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,584
My girlfriend. Big boobs Rosy.

213
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:58,589
What was l going to do taking
the truck to the twelfth floor?

214
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:04,597
How do l take the truck to
the twelfth floor? You tell me.

215
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,707
Maior! Tell me about the truck?

216
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:22,379
What the hell are you guys
talking about? What did l do?

217
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,379
l was iust doing
my work quietly.

218
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:28,718
That's what, Maior. You are
always doing your job quietly.

219
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:31,720
But we aren't going
to sit here quietly.

220
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:34,055
Maior, this time we're going to
make sure that you've a very..

221
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,059
..long appointment with the law.

222
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,230
Yeah, right.
- You bet.

223
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:46,069
Maior, why do l feel that
you've a secret to share?

224
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:50,739
Would you like to listen?
- Sure. Why not?

225
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:59,416
By calling me here, you people
have committed a grave mistake.

226
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:04,590
Really?
- A very grave mistake.

227
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:11,361
Now apologize for your
mistake and tell me..

228
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,528
When do l get to go?

229
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:17,367
When we find the truck.
- And when will you find it?

230
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:20,368
When you tell us about it.

231
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,707
You are asking the wrong person.

232
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,711
Really? Then
who's the right guy?

233
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:48,399
When love
transcends all limits..

234
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:54,572
When life becomes restless..

235
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:08,358
Don't love so much that
Iust goes into your mind..

236
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:12,689
The ocean of love!
The ocean of love!

237
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:26,704
Give me my companion, l'll
pray a million times for you.

238
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:36,047
Give me my companion, l'll
pray a million times for you.

239
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:38,379
Without seeing my beloved..

240
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:40,381
l'm not able to
understand anything..

241
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:45,557
My eyes will tell
you all about love.

242
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,390
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

243
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:50,559
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

244
00:24:50,624 --> 00:24:52,728
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

245
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,397
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

246
00:24:55,462 --> 00:24:59,736
Give me my companion, l'll
pray a million times for you.

247
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,070
Without seeing my beloved..

248
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:06,477
l'm not able to
understand anything..

249
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:43,380
No one is unfaithful..
is bad at heart..

250
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:56,560
By luck, crazy lovers
don't always have bad times.

251
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:01,565
The heart is torn to shreds
when the dagger of time is pierced.

252
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:04,399
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

253
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:06,402
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

254
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:09,338
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

255
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,673
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

256
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:17,516
Give me my companion, l'll
pray a million times for you.

257
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,545
You also fall in love
with the unfaithful.

258
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:57,389
You also fall in love
with the unfaithful.

259
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:03,562
Whoever maybe your companion,
but you do have one.

260
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,728
The ocean of love.

261
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:10,668
l've to love you..
l've to wait for you.

262
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:20,344
l've to love you..
l've to wait for you.

263
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:25,182
Living for me, is
to die in your love.

264
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:29,520
Till when will you be on the
run, making me wait for you?

265
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:32,020
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

266
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:35,024
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

267
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:37,358
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

268
00:27:37,424 --> 00:27:39,628
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

269
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:43,366
Give me my companion, l'll
pray a million times for you.

270
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,534
Without seeing my beloved..

271
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,370
l'm not able to
understand anything..

272
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:53,376
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

273
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,376
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

274
00:27:55,442 --> 00:27:58,380
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

275
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:03,387
The ocean of love
is within my heart.

276
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:36,350
Where were you at 6am.?

277
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:40,522
Hey asshole, l
asked you a question!

278
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:44,527
No English. Tell him
that l don't know English.

279
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:46,193
He doesn't know
the language, sir.

280
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:48,363
Then you tell him what
l ask him. - Oh l will.

281
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:52,369
Where were you at 6am?
- Where were you at 6am?

282
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:54,703
l was with his wife.
- What is he saying?

283
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,371
He said he was in a bar, sir.

284
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:59,374
Well, what was he doing?
- What were you doing?

285
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,378
l was banging.
- He was drinking, sir.

286
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:07,553
With whom? - With whom?
- His wife. - Friends.

287
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:10,318
Where's the truck?
- Where's the truck?

288
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:12,654
l forgot it outside his house.

289
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:16,325
Sir, obviously this man doesn't
know anything about any truck.

290
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:20,498
Does he want us to get nasty? -
Hey hero, don't take uncle Sam..

291
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,334
..to be your uncle. Answer
fast. He's getting angry.

292
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:28,338
Tell him to get angry at his wife,
she also put in the same effort.

293
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:31,407
Look sir, this man obviously
doesn't know about anything.

294
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:35,178
Well then who does? - Then
who knows? - His wife knows.

295
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:39,516
Your wife. - What? - No. My
mistake. He said, 'his man'.

296
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:44,355
His man. - How does he know?
- And how does he know?

297
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:46,354
Because he was banging her too.

298
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,022
Give me a moment, will you, sir?

299
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:52,028
Look, foreigner! Don't act
like the mafia, wearing a trench coat.

300
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,364
This is regarding my iob.
Answer the questions.

301
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:59,703
What the hell are you talking about?
- He's just wasting our time.

302
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:03,540
He's bull-shitting us.
He's playing with us.

303
00:30:03,603 --> 00:30:05,039
They kept asking all night
and Ajju kept answering..

304
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:07,543
..that he was with
that cop's wife.

305
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:09,377
After sometime, even that
officer started believing that..

306
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:11,713
..Aiiu truly was
with Mcguiry's wife.

307
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:19,387
Did you listen? Hey asshole!

308
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:21,557
Uncle Sam has laid
his eyes on you.

309
00:30:23,223 --> 00:30:27,565
Tell him not to look at me too
much. It'll do me bad. Asshole!

310
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,739
Truck.
- Lawyer.

311
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:40,643
What lawyer?
- What truck?

312
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:44,413
Where's the truck?
- Where's my lawyer?

313
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:52,554
Do these people think
of us as talcum powder?

314
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:55,591
Even if they itch a little,
they pick us up.

315
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:59,429
Not talcum powder, but condoms.
They use us all night..

316
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:01,430
..and flush us down the
toilet in the morning.

317
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:06,771
Hey Aiiu! Shall we talk
business? - Yes, boss.

318
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:11,274
Anyway, they pick us
up every third day.

319
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,374
lt isn't good
for my resputation.

320
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:18,381
Which station?
- Resputation. - What?

321
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:22,552
Resputation means status. You
won't understand its English.

322
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:28,391
Ok. Status, that too yours?
Hey donkey, what do..

323
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:30,725
..you do when
you're outside the jail?

324
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:34,395
The same thing that you
do with Mcguiry's wife.

325
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:39,569
This Mcguiry's
wife is quite popular.

326
00:31:41,402 --> 00:31:43,405
How many of you have
an affair with her?

327
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:56,424
Mark? Andy?
- No. My standard is a bit high.

328
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:01,758
Good. Let's get
down to business.

329
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,094
Maior, l had heard that
you had given up everything.

330
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,535
Boss, Maior had promised his
wife that he's given up everything.

331
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:13,034
Just like our hero. Hey! Even
you've promised your girl that..

332
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,369
..you've given up everything,
isn't it?

333
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:19,309
What? What have you
promised your girl?

334
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:27,385
That l'll kill you.
- Then kill him first.

335
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:34,392
l can't give up my business
for a girl. Stupidity! Stupidity!

336
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:40,397
Business!? Have you seen
his girl? - Is she beautiful?

337
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:43,567
Beautiful? She's the
queen of Club India.

338
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:48,406
You're talking of business? l
can leave this world for her sake.

339
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:52,075
l'll help you leave this world.
- Leave him.

340
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:56,078
Hey guys! - Maior!
Major, just ignore them.

341
00:32:56,142 --> 00:33:00,584
They're iust whiling away their
time. You were saying something.

342
00:33:02,248 --> 00:33:04,753
Mcguiry is whiling
away his time with us.

343
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,755
But you people
won't understand that.

344
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:10,359
You keep wasting your
time over unnecessary talks.

345
00:33:10,424 --> 00:33:13,028
You won't think why the
police is always arresting us.

346
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,531
The police commits the
crime of arresting us.

347
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,366
Hence, the police will
pay the price for doing so.

348
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,546
How? - By looting their banks.
- The service American bank?

349
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:33,649
Every cop here has
an account there.

350
00:33:34,214 --> 00:33:37,721
That's why no one has dared
to loot that bank till date.

351
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:43,060
Because the one who loots
this bank will be taken on a..

352
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:46,395
..procession to the
graveyard by the entire police dept.

353
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,568
Then why do you think, smarty,
that the same won't happen to you?

354
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:56,408
Because brother Bali, the security
in that bank is so weak that..

355
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,744
..even your mother will
be able to loot that bank.

356
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:07,082
Till now, they received
their salaries from that bank..

357
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:11,019
..now we'll
receive ours from there.

358
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:13,688
We've received it.

359
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:32,376
We all have to go to hell one day.
Do this job and you'll go in a..

360
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:35,545
..big car else
you'll have to go walking.

361
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:40,050
You can keep your big car.
l prefer walking.

362
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:44,218
lt's better than
going on four shoulders.

363
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,555
Hey stutterer,
try to understand.

364
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,390
You're trying to
make me understand?

365
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:52,060
Do you think this is some
cooperative bank in Kolhapur?

366
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:56,399
You will walk in and point a gun at
the guard, and he will intimate the..

367
00:34:56,463 --> 00:35:01,406
..cashier, who in turn, will gift-wrap
all the money and give it to you..

368
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:04,072
..saying, Happy birthday,
sir! This is America, ass!

369
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:07,076
Within two minutes,
you'll be brought back here..

370
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,678
..and you'll be
celebrating your birthday here.

371
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:14,350
Aiiu is right. - Hell!
We'll have to come back here..

372
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:17,353
..whether we take
the right or the left.

373
00:35:17,418 --> 00:35:21,526
Hey chicken! You're right.
- Yes, l'm right.

374
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:25,294
l'll send for you when
l've to burgle a poultry farm.

375
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,030
Chicken stealer! - Hey don't call me
chicken.. - l won't call you that.

376
00:35:28,094 --> 00:35:30,532
l understood.
- Yes.

377
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:37,272
We've to make them talk,
sir. What do we do with them?

378
00:35:39,372 --> 00:35:45,383
Let them go. l'll
get those damn Indians.

379
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:50,553
Alright! You're free for now.

380
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:53,054
We all started
going our own ways..

381
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,724
..when Satan called out
to us for the last time.

382
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:58,560
lf the bell tolls in
any one of your heads..

383
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:02,733
..then come to club Niagara
tonight. l'll wait for you there.

384
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,569
We.. we'll wait for you there.

385
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:02,390
Mark, why are you
always fighting?

386
00:37:02,456 --> 00:37:04,392
l can't stay calm if
anyone touches you.

387
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,728
This can't go on, it's
got to stop. - l know!

388
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:15,341
Ok. Listen. We'll meet Cyrus,
we'll talk and we'll work it out.

389
00:37:16,169 --> 00:37:19,676
But you've to promise me
that you won't lose your temper.

390
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,013
l won't. Ok? Come.

391
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,185
You've come back again?

392
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,523
Can't you
understand simple words?

393
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:37,527
Listen, man. l haven't
come here to fight with you.

394
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,360
l iust want my iob back. l
promise you, there won't be..

395
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:42,498
..anymore problems
here because of me.

396
00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:45,701
There'll be problems only
when you don't go from here.

397
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:52,374
Ok. C'mon!
- Go, Lisa. Go!

398
00:37:53,206 --> 00:37:59,552
lf one girl goes, a hundred
will come. This is America, baby!

399
00:38:00,213 --> 00:38:04,387
Go with this good-for-nothing.
Go! Go! Go!

400
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:08,057
C'mon, Lisa. C'mon!
- Where, Mark?

401
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:18,336
Lisa!
- No! Look, Mark. l love you.

402
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:27,515
But even l've very few options.
l don't like doing all this.

403
00:38:27,574 --> 00:38:32,517
But what do l do?
You know this is L.A.

404
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:38,523
And it's very difficult for a
girl to stay alone in this city.

405
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:43,528
Very difficult! - But, Lisa,
you're not alone. l'm with you.

406
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,531
Where are you, Mark? You
spend half of your time in jail.

407
00:38:47,594 --> 00:38:49,698
l want to come with you.

408
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:55,371
But when you
have your own house.

409
00:38:57,203 --> 00:38:59,541
l'll surely have
my own house, Lisa.

410
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:05,550
But there won't be any
place for you in that house.

411
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,890
But you know that your
mom doesn't like dogs.

412
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,792
What shit!

413
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:19,462
How many times have l told
you not to use such language?

414
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:21,295
l'm sorry, dad but
this is not fair.

415
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:23,799
C'mon, let's go home.

416
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:27,471
Could we spend some
more time, dad? Please?

417
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:31,808
Listen. You know that
when l take you home late..

418
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,811
..your mom gets angry. She'll
scowl at you. Fights with me.

419
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:39,315
Yeah. - And what when
she comes home late?

420
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:42,486
She works.
- No! She goes out with uncle.

421
00:39:42,982 --> 00:39:46,824
Which uncle?
- The uncle who comes home.

422
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:49,157
The one who
bought me these shoes.

423
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:56,165
Since when is he coming home?
- Since a long time.

424
00:39:59,332 --> 00:40:02,337
C'mon. Let's go home.

425
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:23,859
What time is it? If you
can't bring him home in time..

426
00:40:23,924 --> 00:40:26,863
..then why do you take him out?
- Renu!

427
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,197
Don't 'Renu' me!
It's enough, Andy.

428
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:31,867
lf you're going to act so
irresponsibly then l feel..

429
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,202
..you should stop meeting him.

430
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:36,872
Renu, l'm his father.
- Oh really? Then bear the..

431
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:39,876
..expenses of his education,
his dresses.

432
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,210
You call yourself his father?
Then where were you when..

433
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,546
..he was ill and l had to
call the doctor at midnight?

434
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:46,882
And then where were you
when he was beaten up by..

435
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,884
..his schoolmates and
had come home crying?

436
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,886
You were in iail, Andy.

437
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:54,891
You were in iail
and we got punished.

438
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:57,893
lt wasn't my fault.
It was a mistake.

439
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,895
Yes. It's never
your fault, Andy.

440
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,230
When was it your fault?
It's my entire fault.

441
00:41:02,395 --> 00:41:04,900
lt's my fault that l
married a man like you.

442
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:07,836
You're a loser, Andy.
- Shut up!

443
00:41:08,001 --> 00:41:09,838
Don't shout! This is my house.

444
00:41:10,169 --> 00:41:11,840
And l know what
happens in this house.

445
00:41:12,005 --> 00:41:15,177
Aren't you ashamed! You
come to meet your son so..

446
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:17,345
..that you can ask him
about my personal life?

447
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:22,854
Well, how sick can you get?
- Renu, it's nothing like that.

448
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:25,186
l haven't asked him
anything about you.

449
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,190
l don't care, Andy.
And one more thing..

450
00:41:28,354 --> 00:41:32,863
..don't try to rule over
me because only a husband..

451
00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:35,865
..has the right to do so, and you
Iost that right a long time ago.

452
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,869
Renu! Why don't we start
living together again?

453
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:41,870
l'll work things out.

454
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:45,207
Why? What'll you do?
Will you rob a bank?

455
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:59,222
l don't
understand all your plans.

456
00:41:59,385 --> 00:42:01,890
What l understand is this!
Beauty! Look!

457
00:42:01,955 --> 00:42:04,894
Look! - You can't
understand anything, man.

458
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:07,830
Look, ripe mangoes.
Hello beautiful! How are you?

459
00:42:07,894 --> 00:42:12,837
Hey he's a guy!
- Oh a guy! Not my kind.

460
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:14,836
What a fool!
- Look, here's a girl.

461
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:18,842
Until l lighten up,
my brain doesn't work.

462
00:42:19,005 --> 00:42:23,179
And moreover, my hands have
been aching for the past 10 days.

463
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:26,450
What is your name?
- Sugar! - Sugar!

464
00:42:26,513 --> 00:42:29,852
C'mon, pal! You are
possessed just about one thing.

465
00:42:30,016 --> 00:42:35,192
l agree but my father had told
me not to be possessed at anytime.

466
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:37,860
1
When l was small
my father told..

467
00:42:38,191 --> 00:42:42,867
You fool! When your dad
makes your strip and kicks..

468
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:46,870
..yOU On yOUr aSS,
then you'll understand.

469
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:50,205
Which dad? The one in the
morning, the one in the..

470
00:42:50,269 --> 00:42:52,875
..afternoon, the one in the
evening or the one at night?

471
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:55,878
Even my mom doesn't know
who my actual father is.

472
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:58,881
Not even my mother, you know..

473
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:01,884
You know which dad
l'm talking about.

474
00:43:01,948 --> 00:43:05,220
The one whose powder you
threw in the L.A. atmosphere.

475
00:43:05,952 --> 00:43:10,160
l'll think of some
plan to pay him back.

476
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:14,430
Hey pal! We should find
some solution to this problem.

477
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:16,832
Then what do you think? Does
those people's idea to loot..

478
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:19,836
..a bank, provide a solution?
l'll think of something.

479
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,168
You don't worry.

480
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:26,445
You'll think? - Look, if you
feel that what those four fools..

481
00:43:26,507 --> 00:43:29,846
..think is right, then
you're a bigger fool than them.

482
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,448
Man, their money..
- Don't eat my brains, man!

483
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:33,848
lf you can arrange
for the money somehow..

484
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:35,851
..then do it. Do
it however you want.

485
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:38,454
Let me think about
my little brother.

486
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:40,856
Listening to all these
boring talks of yours..

487
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:43,860
..l feel that it must have
gone slept off standing. - Ok! Ok!

488
00:43:44,925 --> 00:43:47,195
Think, what if
they loot the bank?

489
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,869
Then it's their good fortune.
- Not their good fortune, but ours.

490
00:43:51,932 --> 00:43:57,476
How's that? - Look, if the plan
fails, then we all will escape.

491
00:43:57,538 --> 00:44:01,211
And if it succeeds, then
the money will be with us..

492
00:44:01,274 --> 00:44:03,612
..and four bullets
in their bellies.

493
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:05,880
Keep talking! Keep talking!

494
00:44:05,946 --> 00:44:07,816
Look, there's a
Iot of gain in this.

495
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:09,818
There's iust a
distance of four bullets..

496
00:44:09,883 --> 00:44:11,820
..between us and
millions of dollars

497
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:15,826
After this, the money that was
supposed to be split into six..

498
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:19,161
..will be split into two.
One yours, and the other mine.

499
00:44:20,894 --> 00:44:23,164
Mine will be split
among these people.

500
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:25,834
C'mon, man! - C'mon, Bali! -
No! No! l'll be back after..

501
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:30,173
..killing four others. - What?
- No, you won't understand.

502
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:34,845
l'm coming. - Coming? - l'm
coming. Don't worry. Let's go!

503
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:40,851
Did they like your
job very much? - Yes.

504
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:46,187
This time l've
found the right people.

505
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:52,193
Now there's
nothing more to fear.

506
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:58,870
l have full faith in you. You
can never do anything wrong.

507
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:07,814
But what if it's too late?
- l won't let it be late.

508
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,813
lt's my promise.

509
00:45:41,441 --> 00:45:44,447
So you all are ready.
- Yes, alright.

510
00:45:45,445 --> 00:45:47,850
The plan is..
- Just a minute, Major.

511
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:09,410
What's this? - l knew that
this rascal had stolen the truck..

512
00:46:09,469 --> 00:46:11,139
..and we all got screwed.

513
00:46:11,304 --> 00:46:13,475
That's why l'm splitting
the money among all of us.

514
00:46:15,975 --> 00:46:18,146
All of you keep the
money on the table.

515
00:46:20,146 --> 00:46:23,820
Why? - Because in
order to loot a bank..

516
00:46:23,883 --> 00:46:28,827
..we need guns, cars,
cameras explosives..

517
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:31,159
..and for all
that we need money.

518
00:46:31,324 --> 00:46:33,829
What if l hadn't
been a gentleman, Major?

519
00:46:33,893 --> 00:46:35,831
Then we would've
stolen something else.

520
00:46:35,895 --> 00:46:37,833
We can steal
something else even now.

521
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:40,837
Let's keep the money
with us for the time being.

522
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,171
No, Bali. Maior is right.

523
00:46:46,172 --> 00:46:49,512
When there's a feast,
why should we beg?

524
00:46:57,917 --> 00:46:59,855
Andy!

525
00:47:10,296 --> 00:47:13,469
This money is enough for me.

526
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:25,316
C'mon, it's good. The money
that was to be split into six..

527
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:26,814
..will now be split into five.
- No! Even now, the money..

528
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,150
..will be split into six.
- Why?

529
00:47:29,416 --> 00:47:32,154
Will you give me an
extra share, Major?

530
00:47:32,218 --> 00:47:36,493
Not at all. Every gadgetry
in the bank is computerized.

531
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,829
The cameras, vaults, everything.

532
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:42,832
lt has a security code. And
we need a software engineer..

533
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:45,166
..to break that code.

534
00:47:45,331 --> 00:47:49,506
Why do we need an engineer,
Major? This Tarzan is with us.

535
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:51,840
He'll break the code.

536
00:47:51,905 --> 00:47:54,175
We've to break the
bank's vault, Bali.

537
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,843
Not the bank manager's neck.

538
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,847
Why are you
unnecessarily trying..

539
00:47:58,912 --> 00:48:00,180
..to make him understand, Maior?

540
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:03,453
He doesn't know the difference
between software and underwear.

541
00:48:04,918 --> 00:48:10,128
What do we do now, Maior?
- We've got to get Andy.

542
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:23,809
This is not enough. - l love
my son, isn't that enough?

543
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:26,808
No.
- Meaning?

544
00:48:26,973 --> 00:48:30,814
Look, Andy. This money is
enough to fight the case.

545
00:48:30,877 --> 00:48:34,818
But not enough to win it. To
win the case, the judge will..

546
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:38,153
..ask whether your son has
a bright future with you.

547
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:42,325
Whether your son will get new
clothes, toys to play with..

548
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:44,426
..will he see a
college from inside.

549
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:47,429
The answer to all these
questions is money, Andy.

550
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:52,169
A lot of money. l'm sorry, Andy.

551
00:49:56,997 --> 00:50:01,840
Lifting up their collars..

552
00:50:04,905 --> 00:50:09,179
..puffing on a cigarette.

553
00:50:12,245 --> 00:50:15,852
Lifting up their collars..

554
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:19,857
..puffing on a cigarette.

555
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:21,856
What's there to worry about?

556
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,858
Whatever has to
happen will happen.

557
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:27,865
They've started, blowing off
their worries in a cloud of smoke.

558
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:32,871
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

559
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:37,875
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

560
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:49,220
Gentlemen, welcome to
the Service American Bank.

561
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:31,192
All of us will enter
the bank one by one.

562
00:51:32,459 --> 00:51:35,865
So that all of us get
familiarized with the bank.

563
00:52:04,057 --> 00:52:08,165
They want dollars, they want
pounds, they want to hear..

564
00:52:08,227 --> 00:52:11,835
..the sound of gold coins.

565
00:52:15,902 --> 00:52:19,843
This guy is a fool, he
doesn't know anything.

566
00:52:19,906 --> 00:52:23,178
This guy is a fool, he
doesn't know anything.

567
00:52:23,444 --> 00:52:26,850
He iust wants money.

568
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,850
What's there to worry about?

569
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:30,852
Whatever has to
happen will happen.

570
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:34,858
They've started, blowing off
their worries in a cloud of smoke.

571
00:52:34,921 --> 00:52:38,862
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

572
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:44,868
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

573
00:52:46,467 --> 00:52:49,873
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

574
00:52:52,038 --> 00:52:55,879
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

575
00:52:57,478 --> 00:53:02,888
lf the police comes then
it'll come from here, or here.

576
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:08,827
Meaning, here, here and here.

577
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:11,827
l want all of you to check..

578
00:53:11,992 --> 00:53:14,162
..every nook and
corner of every street.

579
00:53:14,428 --> 00:53:18,168
Do not leave even a corner,
not even a single inch.

580
00:53:18,499 --> 00:53:21,170
Otherwise we won't know from
which way death will come for us.

581
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:33,851
They left behind all
their friends and relatives.

582
00:53:33,913 --> 00:53:37,855
They broke all
the laws of society.

583
00:53:41,455 --> 00:53:45,195
For the sake of
unknown paths..

584
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:48,865
..they turned
their backs to life.

585
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,866
What's there to worry about?

586
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:52,868
Whatever has to
happen will happen.

587
00:53:52,932 --> 00:53:56,874
They've started, blowing off
their worries in a cloud of smoke.

588
00:53:56,936 --> 00:54:00,878
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

589
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:05,882
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

590
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:11,821
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

591
00:54:14,154 --> 00:54:17,828
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

592
00:54:18,492 --> 00:54:21,163
But we've to keep the people
in the bank under control.

593
00:54:22,496 --> 00:54:25,835
We've to keep
them under control.

594
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,837
Neither do l want
any bloodshed there..

595
00:54:28,902 --> 00:54:31,440
..nor any innocent deaths.

596
00:54:31,505 --> 00:54:33,842
Why do these deaths
always have to be innocent?

597
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:36,846
Hey! Why aren't there any
brains inside your skull?

598
00:54:37,911 --> 00:54:39,179
There aren't
answers to all questions.

599
00:54:39,245 --> 00:54:40,848
Then why are there questions?

600
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:42,182
Maior, make him understand.

601
00:54:42,248 --> 00:54:44,519
Why should Maior make me
understand? - Shall l continue?

602
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:50,859
l swear on Allah! No
one throughout America..

603
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:53,194
..can give you
more stuff than me.

604
00:54:53,927 --> 00:54:57,868
Mark, shall we take everything?
- Why?

605
00:54:58,031 --> 00:54:59,868
Are you going to fight a war?

606
00:55:00,033 --> 00:55:02,872
You can even fight a
war with all these, dear.

607
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:05,373
l swear on Allah! Half
of Kashmir resounds with..

608
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,409
..the sound of my bombs.

609
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:11,144
Hasn't anyone
caught you till date?

610
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:14,818
How will anyone catch me?
l'm a very smart man.

611
00:55:14,981 --> 00:55:17,151
l've very highly
placed contacts.

612
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:20,824
So you've very highly
placed contacts eh? - Yes, why?

613
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:23,324
You think that
you're very smart eh?

614
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:25,828
l don't think so,
l'm very smart.

615
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:32,170
Then rat, hasn't anyone told
you not to talk of destroying..

616
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:35,839
..lndia when amidst Indians?

617
00:55:35,902 --> 00:55:39,174
Dear one! Whatever
an Indian might be..

618
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:43,848
..he never likes two things.
One is, losing in cricket..

619
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,847
..and secondly,
attacking our country.

620
00:55:52,919 --> 00:55:55,858
They're so determined
that the earth is..

621
00:55:55,922 --> 00:55:57,859
..above them and
the sky below them.

622
00:55:57,924 --> 00:56:00,462
The burden of the earth
fell on the earth and died.

623
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,196
What's there to worry about?

624
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:03,865
Whatever has to
happen will happen.

625
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:07,804
They've started, blowing off
their worries in a cloud of smoke.

626
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:10,807
Don't know
what'll happen, Oh God!

627
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:14,812
Andy and Mark had always done
bad things living in their country..

628
00:56:14,974 --> 00:56:16,812
..maybe for that moment,
the burden on..

629
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:18,814
..their souls
had lessened a bit.

630
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,150
We'll reach there in
three different cars.

631
00:56:23,149 --> 00:56:25,821
Mark and Aiiu will
be in the first car.

632
00:56:25,985 --> 00:56:28,825
And Mac and Bali
will be in the second.

633
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:30,826
And l and Andy
will be in the third.

634
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:34,832
By the time Andy and l reach, Aiiu
and Mark would've done their job.

635
00:56:34,994 --> 00:56:40,171
First car, second car, third car..
is someone sponsoring the cars?

636
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:43,840
Yes. You're
responsible for that. Here, take.

637
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:49,179
Hey donkey! This money hasn't
been loaned from your chicks.

638
00:56:50,444 --> 00:56:56,856
Bali, use this money like your
brains.. - No way! - ..with care.

639
00:57:05,024 --> 00:57:09,968
Hey! l'm tired of eating this. Why
don't you order rice and pulses?

640
00:57:10,129 --> 00:57:11,967
Hey! Shut up!

641
00:57:12,031 --> 00:57:16,306
Maior, will we scare the
guards by showing our fingers?

642
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:21,980
No. with guns. You,
Mark and Andy will..

643
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:25,983
..collect the guns,
today evening.

644
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,457
Hey! Shoot with one eye shut. -
Bali's bullets find their targets..

645
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:15,558
..by themselves, brother.

646
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:19,963
lf you keep aiming like this then
you'll become a target one day.

647
00:59:20,026 --> 00:59:24,969
lt's easy to shoot words,
Major. Do you know to shoot? Do you?

648
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:33,975
lt's loaded.

649
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:12,682
After that, no one dared
to speak against Major.

650
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:30,367
Eh Bali! Come here.
- What?

651
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:34,371
Tell me one thing, if l
keep this bomb on your head..

652
01:00:34,635 --> 01:00:38,041
..then what will rip open
first? This bomb or your head?

653
01:00:39,205 --> 01:00:45,383
The bomb will rip open first. No.
Actually the head can also rip open.

654
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:50,053
No, pal. This is a really
confusing question. You tell me.

655
01:00:50,383 --> 01:00:52,721
Your ass will rip open first.

656
01:00:55,121 --> 01:01:02,335
Aiiu! - What's this? - Bomb.
l activated it. - What?

657
01:01:02,395 --> 01:01:03,998
Keep sitting. Keep sitting.

658
01:01:04,064 --> 01:01:05,332
Keep sitting?

659
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:08,003
Hey! Will this erupt?

660
01:01:09,069 --> 01:01:13,010
You fool! It's a bomb and it's
beeping, so it's bound to erupt.

661
01:01:13,073 --> 01:01:16,012
Why, man? - You're
scared shit! You're scared!

662
01:01:16,076 --> 01:01:19,348
Hey Mark! Are you standing
there waiting for this bomb..

663
01:01:19,413 --> 01:01:21,617
..to erupt!?
Deactivate it! Deactivate it!

664
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:23,351
lt's can't be deactivated.
- What do you mean?

665
01:01:23,617 --> 01:01:26,355
Meaning? You forgot
Hindi along with English?

666
01:01:27,087 --> 01:01:30,026
ls this bomb enough to
kill this scoundrel..

667
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:33,029
..or do l keep another?
- No! It's not needed.

668
01:01:33,093 --> 01:01:34,629
He'll die such a death that
he won't take birth again.

669
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:36,364
Then here, smoke
your last cigarette?

670
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:40,637
Tell me something, Mark.
- Yes. - When the bomb erupts..

671
01:01:40,701 --> 01:01:42,036
Yes.
- Will his hands tear off from..

672
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:44,039
..the elbow or
from the shoulder?

673
01:01:44,638 --> 01:01:47,042
He'll die!
- He'll die!? - Yes.

674
01:01:48,108 --> 01:01:51,047
lf l die, then l'll take
everyone else along with me.

675
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:54,050
Then who'll fulfill
your rites? My father?

676
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:56,050
Do you have any one of your own?

677
01:01:56,116 --> 01:01:58,386
You beggar! Why
fear when l'm here?

678
01:01:58,452 --> 01:02:00,054
l fear because the bomb is here.

679
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:05,998
Hey Mark! From today, l'll
address your girl as my sister.

680
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,996
You'll do so, right?
- Yes. - You'll do so? - Yes.

681
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:10,331
Then throw it. Throw
it else it'll burst.

682
01:02:10,396 --> 01:02:12,601
Why?
- Throw it else it'll burst.

683
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,335
Hey throw it! It'll burst! -
Hey Bali! Throw it! - Hey! Hey!

684
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:16,003
Hey Andy! Take it!

685
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:19,008
Look what happened there!
Look what happened there!

686
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:35,024
You call this a bomb?
There's gas coming out of it.

687
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:37,358
Why? Are you
regretting about being alive?

688
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:40,630
Moreover, it made a chicken out
of you. Didn't it? - Yes, it did.

689
01:02:40,694 --> 01:02:43,365
So, this is our plan incase
the police comes there tomorrow.

690
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:46,636
Why are you talking about
the police all the time?

691
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,035
You're scaring me.
Why don't you say..

692
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:49,369
..at least once that
the police won't come?

693
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:53,042
lf.. Bali, if.. - This
'lf' is a very dangerous word.

694
01:02:53,206 --> 01:02:55,043
lf this happens,
then this will happen.

695
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:57,378
lf this doesn't happen,
then that won't happen.

696
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:00,048
lf my aunt grows
moustaches then l'll call her uncle.

697
01:03:00,213 --> 01:03:02,585
This is very bad.

698
01:03:02,649 --> 01:03:05,988
Hey Bali! Hey Bali!
Why do you get tensed?

699
01:03:06,052 --> 01:03:07,320
What are you
talking about tension?

700
01:03:07,386 --> 01:03:08,990
lt scares the shit out of me.
You're talking of tension.

701
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,992
Hey! Who knows about tomorrow?

702
01:03:11,157 --> 01:03:14,497
Here, take. Have a cigarette.
C'mon! What'll l do about this?

703
01:03:21,602 --> 01:03:24,006
Aiiu's bomb helped us forget
everything for a few moments..

704
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:27,009
..and gave us an
opportunity to laugh.

705
01:03:28,074 --> 01:03:30,011
How could we know
that death was..

706
01:03:30,076 --> 01:03:32,346
..secretly
Iaughing at us as well.

707
01:03:37,684 --> 01:03:42,359
We all will go in 2l2
formation. Mac and Bali first..

708
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:46,029
..and then me and Andy. Aiiu
and Mark will be present..

709
01:03:46,092 --> 01:03:48,029
..there already. Once
we're in, we're all strangers.

710
01:03:48,094 --> 01:03:50,031
No one will talk to the other.

711
01:03:50,096 --> 01:03:53,035
As soon as we go in, me and
Andy will go to the manager's..

712
01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:56,371
..cabin. l'll handle the
manager and Andy, you'll manage the..

713
01:03:56,436 --> 01:03:59,041
..security cameras. We'll have
only five minutes for you. Ok?

714
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:03,481
All four of you will be in
your positions. Near the alarms.

715
01:04:04,043 --> 01:04:09,320
As soon as l come out wearing
a mask you all will wear yours.

716
01:04:09,483 --> 01:04:13,657
And move the security guards
away from the alarm first.

717
01:04:14,053 --> 01:04:16,324
lf anyone presses the
alarm before deactivating it..

718
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:19,662
..then we sink along
with our plan. Get it?

719
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:33,343
We had everything with us.
Plan, money and courage.

720
01:04:33,507 --> 01:04:38,015
lf we didn't have anything,
then it was just mutual trust.

721
01:04:38,077 --> 01:04:42,019
Because we all had taken birth
Iearning one thing from our..

722
01:04:42,081 --> 01:04:45,021
..mother's womb : Never trust
anyone ! Not even your mother !

723
01:04:46,085 --> 01:04:48,356
Which iunkyard have
you brought us to, Major?

724
01:04:48,522 --> 01:04:52,696
Ok everybody, cell phones.
- Why?

725
01:04:54,093 --> 01:04:56,031
Neither will anyone
use their phones now..

726
01:04:56,095 --> 01:04:57,364
..nor will anyone
move out of this place.

727
01:04:57,531 --> 01:04:59,033
And we'll loot
the bank tomorrow.

728
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:02,972
But the plan to loot the bank
is for the day after tomorrow.

729
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,974
We'll loot it tomorrow.
Any problems?

730
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:08,309
Very smart, Maior. l understood.

731
01:05:09,042 --> 01:05:11,981
lf we loot the bank tomorrow
instead of the day after..

732
01:05:12,145 --> 01:05:16,319
..then none of us will be
able to make our own plans.

733
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,987
l'm with you.

734
01:05:23,323 --> 01:05:24,993
Me, too.

735
01:05:29,062 --> 01:05:30,330
l don't keep one.

736
01:05:30,396 --> 01:05:33,001
Ok, one final time.
We'll discuss the plan again.

737
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:35,336
How many times do we
discuss the plan, Major?

738
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:38,006
lf we discuss it once again,
then we'll forget everything.

739
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:40,341
Then what'll we do
till tomorrow morning?

740
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:44,013
What'll we do? We'll
drink and make merry!

741
01:05:45,078 --> 01:05:47,348
l'll arrange for a
couple of babes.

742
01:05:47,514 --> 01:05:52,022
Hey! Keep it.
- No? - No.

743
01:05:55,188 --> 01:06:03,972
Hey listen! The plan. The
plan is a watch. Swiss watch.

744
01:06:05,031 --> 01:06:08,303
The parts of the watch,
that's us. If we're pe_ect..

745
01:06:08,368 --> 01:06:10,973
..then the watch
is also pe_ect.

746
01:06:12,038 --> 01:06:15,979
Tick- tock! Tick-tock!
Otherwise, it'll turn into..

747
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:22,989
..a bomb and we'll go..
boom.. understood?

748
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:30,328
Yes, so what was l saying?
The plan. Once more, the plan.

749
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:32,995
l'm sick, l'm tired.
Whatever you've said..

750
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:35,329
..has stuck to my brains,
brother.

751
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:44,006
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!

752
01:06:45,071 --> 01:06:48,010
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!

753
01:06:56,082 --> 01:06:59,354
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

754
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,559
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

755
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:06,964
Hey brother! Big daddy,
don't twist my brains.

756
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:13,302
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

757
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:16,973
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

758
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:24,979
Hey! Hey!

759
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,318
Hey! Hey!

760
01:07:31,485 --> 01:07:33,989
There's a bank, within
the bank, there's a safe..

761
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:37,995
..in the safe, there's booty
and on the booty are our eyes.

762
01:07:38,324 --> 01:07:40,996
Bank.. boom.. safe.. boom..
booty.. boom..

763
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:45,002
We're rich now, we
don't have any worries.

764
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:52,344
You'll forget getting panicky,
tomorrow, we'll have so much money.

765
01:07:52,506 --> 01:07:54,610
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!

766
01:07:54,674 --> 01:07:57,346
Planning has
become too boring.

767
01:07:57,511 --> 01:08:00,015
Open the bottle and pour
the liqueur. Understood?

768
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,286
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

769
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:06,956
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

770
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:11,963
Hey brother! Big daddy,
don't twist my brains.

771
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:15,966
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

772
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:19,301
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

773
01:08:46,325 --> 01:08:50,000
Hey brother, we're
tired so we're sitting..

774
01:08:50,063 --> 01:08:54,337
Aren't you tired of sitting?
C'mon! C'mon! Talk!

775
01:08:55,068 --> 01:08:59,009
Money! Money! Money
did something amazing..

776
01:08:59,072 --> 01:09:02,011
..it trapped my
heart in a net.

777
01:09:02,108 --> 01:09:04,947
What's love.. romance..
- boom.. - booty.. - boom..

778
01:09:05,011 --> 01:09:08,952
..it threw me
empty-handed out of life.

779
01:09:09,115 --> 01:09:12,956
Leave love's collar, brother.
Let's count dollars, brother.

780
01:09:13,019 --> 01:09:15,958
Forget the game of love..

781
01:09:16,122 --> 01:09:18,961
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!

782
01:09:20,026 --> 01:09:23,298
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

783
01:09:23,464 --> 01:09:30,978
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

784
01:09:32,038 --> 01:09:34,977
Look, our poet woke up.

785
01:09:38,044 --> 01:09:41,316
l left everything..
l left everything..

786
01:09:41,482 --> 01:09:46,658
l broke the heart
that gave me love.

787
01:09:48,054 --> 01:09:51,995
l left my own.. my dreams..

788
01:09:52,058 --> 01:09:55,330
l broke my relation with ioy.

789
01:09:55,394 --> 01:09:58,000
l left everything..

790
01:09:59,065 --> 01:10:05,010
This world is crafty..
anything can happen here.

791
01:10:06,072 --> 01:10:09,612
This world is crafty..
anything can happen here.

792
01:10:09,676 --> 01:10:13,015
Give up receiving..
giving.. crying.. Ioving..

793
01:10:13,179 --> 01:10:16,018
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!

794
01:10:19,085 --> 01:10:22,024
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

795
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:26,029
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

796
01:10:26,092 --> 01:10:29,031
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

797
01:10:29,195 --> 01:10:34,038
Hey brother! Big daddy,
don't twist my brains.

798
01:10:35,101 --> 01:10:38,373
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

799
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:42,045
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

800
01:10:42,108 --> 01:10:45,548
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

801
01:10:45,645 --> 01:10:50,054
Leave it! Leave it! Leave it!
Don't split my brains!

802
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:24,173
Excuse me, gentlemen. Is
this some kind of a joke?

803
01:13:25,672 --> 01:13:31,182
No. Actually it's a robbery.
Forget it.

804
01:13:32,579 --> 01:13:35,518
lf we're successful today, then
at the most, you'll lose your..

805
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:37,519
..iob. if we're unsuccessful,
then..

806
01:13:37,584 --> 01:13:39,854
..at the least,
you'll lose your life.

807
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:45,196
So you do your work quietly
and let us do ours. Got it?

808
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:47,529
l'll translate real fast.

809
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:51,868
lf we pull this one off..
if we pull this one off..

810
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:54,536
..at worst, you lose your iob.

811
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:57,540
lf we don't, at the best,
you'll be shot.

812
01:13:59,072 --> 01:14:00,809
So why don't you
shut your mouth..

813
01:14:00,874 --> 01:14:04,481
..and continue doing your
work and allow us to do ours.

814
01:14:04,545 --> 01:14:06,482
Excuse me.

815
01:15:24,558 --> 01:15:26,495
Everybody down!

816
01:15:30,664 --> 01:15:32,501
Down!

817
01:15:37,103 --> 01:15:38,506
Down!

818
01:15:49,115 --> 01:15:50,852
Down! Down!

819
01:15:57,591 --> 01:15:59,461
Down!

820
01:16:26,152 --> 01:16:28,490
What babe?

821
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:34,499
What are you doing tonight?

822
01:16:35,562 --> 01:16:39,503
We can enioy all night,
l'll have enough

823
01:16:39,566 --> 01:16:42,838
..money after looting this bank.

824
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:59,789
Hey! Put up your hands!
Put up your hands!

825
01:23:01,782 --> 01:23:03,785
Out!

826
01:23:05,619 --> 01:23:07,456
C'mon!

827
01:26:15,141 --> 01:26:17,479
Steady! Easy!

828
01:26:20,146 --> 01:26:23,085
Kill me. - This bullet
will kill you before that.

829
01:26:25,151 --> 01:26:27,321
Now don't shout anymore. Ok?

830
01:26:27,386 --> 01:26:31,161
Half of your life
will perish shouting!

831
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:44,339
lf you've the strength to shout then
have the strength to bear the pain.

832
01:26:45,171 --> 01:26:47,341
lt'll burn a little. Ok?

833
01:26:58,117 --> 01:26:59,286
lf you had listened to me earlier..

834
01:26:59,352 --> 01:27:00,455
..then you wouldn't
have had to scream now.

835
01:27:02,121 --> 01:27:04,292
l won't scream!

836
01:27:04,357 --> 01:27:06,294
l won't scream!

837
01:27:08,127 --> 01:27:10,131
Just relax.

838
01:27:21,307 --> 01:27:23,478
Maior!

839
01:27:23,544 --> 01:27:26,315
Maior, l'm feeling very scared.

840
01:27:29,315 --> 01:27:31,987
lt's ok, you should feel scared.

841
01:27:33,487 --> 01:27:36,391
You've been
brave all day, today.

842
01:27:37,156 --> 01:27:39,327
lt doesn't matter if
you feel afraid now.

843
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:43,332
l'll take you to the hospital
as soon as these people show up.

844
01:27:44,163 --> 01:27:47,504
Promise me. Promise me, Maior.
- Yes. l promise.

845
01:27:48,502 --> 01:27:51,340
What if l die
before they show up?

846
01:27:51,405 --> 01:27:53,341
We'll bury you somewhere.

847
01:27:54,941 --> 01:27:58,280
Hey! Nothing will
happen to you, understood?

848
01:27:59,112 --> 01:28:01,450
We've been trapped.

849
01:28:02,282 --> 01:28:07,626
Hey! He's dead!

850
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:10,291
l'm still alive.

851
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:15,064
Don't worry. You'll surely die.

852
01:28:15,128 --> 01:28:17,365
Shut up! Just shut up!

853
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,638
Nothing will
happen to you. Nothing!

854
01:28:24,304 --> 01:28:27,477
ls it paining a lot?

855
01:28:28,141 --> 01:28:30,646
No. It's tickling
me and l'm laughing.

856
01:28:31,144 --> 01:28:34,316
lt'll hurt you more
if you laugh, jackass!

857
01:28:36,316 --> 01:28:38,654
Lie there quietly, you'll live.

858
01:28:43,156 --> 01:28:45,995
Where are the rest?
- l don't know.

859
01:28:46,059 --> 01:28:48,329
How did you come here?
- By car.

860
01:28:49,162 --> 01:28:50,999
What car? - The lady
didn't tell me her name.

861
01:28:51,064 --> 01:28:53,334
Which lady? - Someone over there,
but she isn't there any longer.

862
01:28:55,936 --> 01:28:58,441
One among us is a traitor.
- What?

863
01:28:59,105 --> 01:29:01,610
One of us is an
informer for the police.

864
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:04,112
You think one of us
is a police informer?

865
01:29:05,111 --> 01:29:07,281
Don't you think so, oldie?

866
01:29:08,114 --> 01:29:10,284
Hey! Mind your tongue.

867
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:12,455
Else you won't leave this place.

868
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:15,290
l'm not bothered!
Even then l'll speak.

869
01:29:16,289 --> 01:29:19,529
Someone has vomited
everything to the police.

870
01:29:20,126 --> 01:29:23,298
And if you don't feel so then..

871
01:29:23,363 --> 01:29:26,135
..you've lost your
mind and he, his life.

872
01:29:26,199 --> 01:29:28,470
Shut up! Shut up!

873
01:29:28,535 --> 01:29:30,304
l won't shut up!

874
01:29:32,473 --> 01:29:34,476
You had said that there
won't be much security there.

875
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:35,976
Yes, l had said that there
wasn't much security there.

876
01:29:36,042 --> 01:29:38,312
Because there shouldn't
have been much security there.

877
01:29:38,378 --> 01:29:43,321
Then how did my in-laws reach that
place with my wedding procession?

878
01:29:46,152 --> 01:29:49,659
lt's possible that someone
might have tipped off the police..

879
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:52,662
..so that they could escape
with the money at the last moment.

880
01:29:55,161 --> 01:29:58,501
Yes, that's possible.

881
01:29:59,165 --> 01:30:01,335
Where's the bag?
- Huh?

882
01:30:02,168 --> 01:30:04,338
Bag.. where's your bag?

883
01:30:04,405 --> 01:30:08,178
That.. it's there somewhere.
- Where?

884
01:30:08,241 --> 01:30:11,013
Somewhere there..
- Where there?

885
01:30:11,077 --> 01:30:13,347
Why should l tell you?

886
01:30:13,414 --> 01:30:16,352
Let everyone
come then l'll tell.

887
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:18,687
Where's the bag!

888
01:30:26,192 --> 01:30:28,530
Have you said anything?
- No.

889
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:39,541
How did you escape from there?
- How did you?

890
01:30:39,606 --> 01:30:41,710
l asked you first.

891
01:30:42,543 --> 01:30:45,047
l hit three out-laws,
one in-law..

892
01:30:45,111 --> 01:30:47,583
..and escaped with his car.

893
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:53,389
l hope you don't
feel that all this..

894
01:30:53,454 --> 01:30:55,323
..is my doing?
- It's possible.

895
01:30:59,325 --> 01:31:01,328
lt's possible in
your case as well.

896
01:31:02,161 --> 01:31:04,667
lt's possible. - It's possible.
Why isn't it possible?

897
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:09,336
He has died.
- He's unconscious.

898
01:31:09,403 --> 01:31:12,174
No, he isn't moving. He's dead.

899
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:14,342
He's unconscious.
Let's go there and talk.

900
01:31:14,408 --> 01:31:16,512
Why did l feel that he has died?

901
01:31:20,013 --> 01:31:23,352
Tell me something, Maior.

902
01:31:23,417 --> 01:31:26,623
lf the police can come there,
then it can come here as well.

903
01:31:27,353 --> 01:31:32,362
So? - So what? Let
the both of us leave.

904
01:31:34,193 --> 01:31:36,031
And what about him?

905
01:31:36,096 --> 01:31:39,368
What about him?
- He's injured.

906
01:31:39,433 --> 01:31:42,705
We're not going to leave him
like that. We'll kill him.

907
01:31:45,539 --> 01:31:47,542
What are you looking at, Maior?

908
01:31:47,707 --> 01:31:50,513
He's of no use. He's a
burden on the earth.

909
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:54,317
He's your friend.

910
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:58,489
There aren't any friends
in business, only partners.

911
01:31:59,152 --> 01:32:00,989
He was the one
who taught me that.

912
01:32:01,054 --> 01:32:03,324
From the first day, till today.

913
01:32:04,157 --> 01:32:07,329
Every story is about his share.

914
01:32:48,535 --> 01:32:52,542
Hey! Stop! Hurry up!
Let's leave!

915
01:32:53,206 --> 01:32:56,479
Who are you?
- l'm a cop.

916
01:32:56,543 --> 01:32:58,312
And who's that?
- Thief.

917
01:33:00,146 --> 01:33:02,484
What's in your hand?
How much do you have?

918
01:33:02,549 --> 01:33:05,320
Ten. - Five each. -
Seven mine and three yours.

919
01:33:06,152 --> 01:33:10,494
Five each. - Ok, truce. Six
mine and four yours. C'mon, man!

920
01:33:10,557 --> 01:33:13,328
No. Five each.
- Ok done.

921
01:33:13,393 --> 01:33:15,498
Let's leave! Run!

922
01:33:35,181 --> 01:33:38,186
He's a rogue! A rogue!

923
01:33:38,351 --> 01:33:42,526
Had l been in his place today, then
he would've said the same thing.

924
01:33:44,357 --> 01:33:46,360
You both would've
killed me and left.

925
01:33:47,193 --> 01:33:49,698
He got shot, his fate.

926
01:33:49,763 --> 01:33:51,700
We weren't, our luck.

927
01:33:52,699 --> 01:33:55,303
Shut up! Just shut up!

928
01:33:56,136 --> 01:34:00,478
Anyway, that dog is
going to die in an hour.

929
01:34:01,141 --> 01:34:04,481
Why don't we kill him and
escape from here? - Shut up!

930
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:09,317
Shut up!

931
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:15,326
Ok. If you don't want to come..

932
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:19,662
..then don't. l'm leaving.

933
01:34:19,726 --> 01:34:22,498
Hey Bali! Bali!

934
01:34:31,171 --> 01:34:33,509
You've gotten into my nerves!

935
01:34:33,573 --> 01:34:36,011
Since when have l been
tolerating your nonsense!

936
01:34:36,075 --> 01:34:39,516
You're sick! You're sick!

937
01:34:39,579 --> 01:34:41,015
l won't be able to tolerate
your nonsense any longer..

938
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:42,349
..do you understand that?

939
01:34:43,183 --> 01:34:45,521
Understand?

940
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,358
Now before l shoot your
brains off your skull..

941
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:54,298
..tell me where's the bag.
Where's the bag?

942
01:34:59,132 --> 01:35:03,206
Great, Maior!
Blow his brains off!

943
01:35:04,137 --> 01:35:07,142
Even l want to see whether he's
got grass stuffed inside or hay.

944
01:35:08,141 --> 01:35:11,481
You're alive. l
thought you were dead.

945
01:35:12,145 --> 01:35:16,319
Were you thinking so..
or wanting so, Major?

946
01:35:18,151 --> 01:35:21,658
What do you mean?
- Nothing. Nothing.

947
01:35:22,489 --> 01:35:26,162
lt would've been good
had anyone shot you.

948
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:30,667
You shoot me, that's
why the police spared me.

949
01:35:30,731 --> 01:35:32,501
For you.

950
01:35:36,336 --> 01:35:38,507
Where are Andy and Mark?

951
01:35:38,572 --> 01:35:41,009
l don't know.

952
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:43,512
You're acting as if
nothing has happened.

953
01:35:44,177 --> 01:35:47,349
What has happened? - He thinks
there's an informer amidst us.

954
01:35:48,181 --> 01:35:51,186
What do you think, Maior?
- It's possible.

955
01:35:51,251 --> 01:35:54,290
l don't think so. l know.

956
01:35:54,354 --> 01:35:55,957
What else do you know?

957
01:35:56,022 --> 01:35:58,292
What do you mean by that?

958
01:36:00,126 --> 01:36:05,302
There's someone amidst
us who's an informer.

959
01:36:05,365 --> 01:36:07,302
You're the one.
- What?

960
01:36:09,469 --> 01:36:13,477
You're the informer.
- Hey! Don't talk nonsense.

961
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:17,213
l'm not talking nonsense. You
informed the police, isn't it?

962
01:36:18,144 --> 01:36:20,482
l've evidence to prove it.
- Hey smarty!

963
01:36:22,148 --> 01:36:25,320
Don't act smart or else..
- Or else what?

964
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:28,991
l'll shoot you, mad guy!

965
01:36:30,156 --> 01:36:33,161
Yes, l'm slowly going mad.

966
01:36:35,495 --> 01:36:38,668
Shoot me!
- Look Ajju, l'll shoot you.

967
01:36:39,165 --> 01:36:41,670
Shoot me!
- l'll shoot you!

968
01:36:42,335 --> 01:36:45,340
Hey Aiiu, l'll shoot you.

969
01:36:48,508 --> 01:36:53,017
Hey Bali, your gun is
as empty as your head.

970
01:36:53,079 --> 01:36:56,285
Where are the bullets?
- It was there..

971
01:36:56,349 --> 01:36:58,454
l swear it was there.

972
01:36:58,518 --> 01:37:01,056
lt was there.. where's it?

973
01:37:01,121 --> 01:37:03,291
lt's here.

974
01:37:12,466 --> 01:37:13,968
This is loaded.

975
01:37:15,301 --> 01:37:17,304
What are you doing?
- l've found out everything.

976
01:37:18,138 --> 01:37:20,308
You've been seen with
a policeman many times.

977
01:37:21,307 --> 01:37:24,146
Who's seen me?
- A man. He's coming.

978
01:37:25,145 --> 01:37:27,315
Your man is talking nonsense.

979
01:37:28,148 --> 01:37:30,318
Since when are you
fooling us? Speak up!

980
01:37:31,151 --> 01:37:35,158
How do l fool you?
You're already one.

981
01:37:36,156 --> 01:37:38,995
You planned all this
with a policeman, isn't it?

982
01:37:39,159 --> 01:37:41,329
You can think what you want.
But move this pistol.

983
01:37:41,394 --> 01:37:43,331
Ok.

984
01:37:45,165 --> 01:37:51,176
Listen.. Move it! You'll
fire a shot by mistake. Hey!

985
01:37:51,237 --> 01:37:53,007
Move it! Hey!

986
01:38:02,281 --> 01:38:04,453
Move it! Move it!

987
01:38:07,286 --> 01:38:09,458
Chicken!

988
01:38:11,458 --> 01:38:13,962
He's such a chicken!

989
01:38:15,462 --> 01:38:19,636
What you said there..
what's it about?

990
01:38:20,133 --> 01:38:23,138
l was iust kidding, Maior.

991
01:38:23,203 --> 01:38:25,474
There should be
some fun, isn't it?

992
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,311
That guy has been shot,
and he's lying there.

993
01:38:30,143 --> 01:38:32,481
There's no sign of Andy and Mark.
The police can come in anytime.

994
01:38:32,546 --> 01:38:34,181
And you feel like having fun?

995
01:38:35,482 --> 01:38:38,487
Ok, Maior. l'm sorry.
l was just..

996
01:38:38,552 --> 01:38:41,658
l was iust what?
l was just what?

997
01:38:42,155 --> 01:38:45,327
All of you are crazy! Don't
know what l've gotten myself into!

998
01:38:45,391 --> 01:38:48,163
Hey Maior..
- Hey! Move your hand!

999
01:38:50,329 --> 01:38:53,335
Now don't get so annoyed..
- What don't get annoyed?

1000
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:57,941
You're getting too angry,
Major. l was just kidding.

1001
01:39:01,274 --> 01:39:03,612
Even l was kidding.

1002
01:39:11,452 --> 01:39:13,455
Hey don't touch me!

1003
01:39:19,292 --> 01:39:23,467
lf you're done with your love
scene, then shall l say something?

1004
01:39:23,530 --> 01:39:25,299
Yes. Tell me. What do
you want to blabber about?

1005
01:39:26,299 --> 01:39:30,306
Yes. l'll blabber. From now,
l'm going to blabber.

1006
01:39:30,369 --> 01:39:34,479
We're standing like this over
here. What if the police come?

1007
01:39:34,641 --> 01:39:37,546
Let them come. We'll see.

1008
01:39:37,611 --> 01:39:40,650
You see them. See
them through binoculars.

1009
01:39:41,147 --> 01:39:43,986
l'm going.
- Where are you going?

1010
01:39:44,050 --> 01:39:46,154
Somewhere where l can stay alive.

1011
01:39:46,219 --> 01:39:49,492
At least one of us has to
stay alive to attend your burial.

1012
01:39:50,156 --> 01:39:52,494
Asking where, huh! Bye!

1013
01:39:59,165 --> 01:40:01,335
Hey! What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

1014
01:40:01,401 --> 01:40:03,506
You're not going anywhere.

1015
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:09,514
Tell me something, who are
you to stop me everyday?

1016
01:40:09,576 --> 01:40:13,517
Your father. Because right now,
he's the one who has a loaded gun.

1017
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:15,349
So? So?

1018
01:40:15,415 --> 01:40:19,524
So you're such a chicken..
such a chicken..

1019
01:40:20,186 --> 01:40:23,358
..that a few bullets fired here and
there made you wet your pants eh?

1020
01:40:24,357 --> 01:40:27,196
Hey chicken! Hey chicken,
speak up!

1021
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:31,267
Yes, l'm a chicken!
l'm a chicken!

1022
01:40:33,534 --> 01:40:36,539
You're a beggar!

1023
01:40:37,203 --> 01:40:40,042
A beggar! You don't
have anyone of your own.

1024
01:40:40,106 --> 01:40:44,380
l've a twenty year old sister. A
twenty year old sister, understood?

1025
01:40:44,444 --> 01:40:47,049
Shall l marry her?

1026
01:40:47,113 --> 01:40:50,720
Will you marry her? Do
you have the guts to do so?

1027
01:40:52,218 --> 01:40:56,326
She's mentally
retarded since birth.

1028
01:40:56,389 --> 01:41:01,332
l'll be your slave all
life if you marry her.

1029
01:41:01,394 --> 01:41:03,999
Will you marry her?
l've taken care of her..

1030
01:41:04,064 --> 01:41:07,236
..since childhood.
Will you take care of her?

1031
01:41:10,336 --> 01:41:14,511
l'm a chicken! So what?
What's wrong in that?

1032
01:41:15,175 --> 01:41:18,682
You're scared to
death now, aren't you?

1033
01:41:21,515 --> 01:41:23,518
Aren't you scared now?

1034
01:41:31,425 --> 01:41:35,699
You were making a big plan!
We'll earn a lot of money!

1035
01:41:36,362 --> 01:41:40,203
Earn a lot of money, eh?

1036
01:41:41,702 --> 01:41:46,545
Because of you we all are in a mess
now. Because of you, understood?

1037
01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:53,382
He's right.
- Major, you too?

1038
01:41:55,148 --> 01:41:57,151
Hadn't you shot that fellow then we
wouldn't have gotten into trouble.

1039
01:41:57,217 --> 01:42:01,325
l can't understand you people. -
Why? Didn't you shoot that man?

1040
01:42:01,387 --> 01:42:03,658
He was trying to
press the alarm, Major.

1041
01:42:03,724 --> 01:42:07,998
All the alarms were deactivated.
All the alarms were deactivated.

1042
01:42:08,061 --> 01:42:11,501
l had forgotten that!

1043
01:42:11,565 --> 01:42:12,667
l explained to him a
thousand times not to move.

1044
01:42:12,733 --> 01:42:14,001
l even pressed a gun to his temple.

1045
01:42:14,067 --> 01:42:16,672
Even then he moved,
so l shot him.

1046
01:42:18,171 --> 01:42:20,341
lt was a matter of my honor.
What else could l've done?

1047
01:42:21,174 --> 01:42:24,013
Then you did the right thing.

1048
01:42:24,077 --> 01:42:28,185
Even l don't compromise
when it comes to my honor.

1049
01:42:28,347 --> 01:42:32,523
Hey! What are you saying? Even
you killed four people there.

1050
01:42:32,586 --> 01:42:35,357
What else could l have done?
l had to protect myself.

1051
01:42:36,189 --> 01:42:39,261
Even you should've practiced
your firing on 2-3 people.

1052
01:42:40,193 --> 01:42:43,700
lt was such a fine opportunity,
so many constables together.

1053
01:42:43,764 --> 01:42:45,534
Do you think that
l'm a donkey like you?

1054
01:42:47,534 --> 01:42:51,040
Because of your
foolishness l'm trapped here today.

1055
01:42:51,104 --> 01:42:53,709
He.. he.. he got
shot instead of me.

1056
01:42:54,140 --> 01:42:57,981
That bullet was meant for me, l was
saved because he came in between.

1057
01:42:58,311 --> 01:43:00,482
lf not, then l
would've died today. Fools!

1058
01:43:03,316 --> 01:43:06,489
lf l had known that
you all are such big..

1059
01:43:08,154 --> 01:43:10,659
Then l wouldn't have taken up this iob
l would never have taken up this job.

1060
01:43:12,493 --> 01:43:14,997
Hey Maior!
- What is it?

1061
01:43:15,328 --> 01:43:18,333
Are you going to bark all day or
are you going to bite as well?

1062
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:30,345
Hey! What did you say?

1063
01:43:35,015 --> 01:43:37,018
What did you say?

1064
01:43:41,187 --> 01:43:44,192
Are you going to bark all day or
are you going to bite as well?

1065
01:43:50,531 --> 01:43:53,035
You want me to bite you eh?

1066
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:58,307
Leave him, Maior.

1067
01:43:58,371 --> 01:44:00,976
l'll pump so many bullets
into you that the next time..

1068
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:04,648
..you press the trigger, the bullet
will come from some place else.

1069
01:44:04,711 --> 01:44:05,979
Why do you mess with this pimp?

1070
01:44:06,046 --> 01:44:08,316
Hey you whore! Whom
are you calling a pimp?

1071
01:44:08,381 --> 01:44:11,153
Why? Hasn't anyone called
you by your real name before?

1072
01:44:11,217 --> 01:44:13,989
Yes. l'm a pimp. Your
girl's pimp. What'll you do?

1073
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:27,503
lf anyone of you lifts your
hands again, then l'll shoot you.

1074
01:44:28,167 --> 01:44:31,340
Did you enioy?
- Yes, l did.

1075
01:44:31,405 --> 01:44:35,178
Hey Mark! Leave it. He's crazy.

1076
01:44:35,241 --> 01:44:38,347
Maior, are you taking sides
with him. - To hell with you all!

1077
01:44:39,178 --> 01:44:42,351
l played along with you all thinking
that the job will be done easily..

1078
01:44:42,416 --> 01:44:46,356
..l'll get some money.. - And
then you and your girl will..

1079
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:48,690
Shut up! Shut up!

1080
01:44:49,188 --> 01:44:52,361
First tell me, how did the
police come there? - They flew in.

1081
01:44:53,192 --> 01:44:55,297
They were called.
- By whom?

1082
01:44:56,129 --> 01:45:01,305
That's what l'm saying.
There's a traitor amidst us.

1083
01:45:02,135 --> 01:45:06,309
You.
- Why? Can't it be you?

1084
01:45:10,944 --> 01:45:14,116
How did he come here?
- l brought him.

1085
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:18,622
Why? - Because he'll
tell us who's the traitor.

1086
01:45:19,786 --> 01:45:22,825
Since when is he here?
- Since l put him here.

1087
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:25,259
Why did you need to
put up such an act?

1088
01:45:25,325 --> 01:45:26,795
You should've brought him directly.

1089
01:45:27,794 --> 01:45:31,968
Maior, it's exciting if
there's a twist in the story.

1090
01:45:53,753 --> 01:45:55,924
He's asked us a
Iot of questions.

1091
01:45:56,756 --> 01:45:58,594
Now it's our turn.

1092
01:45:59,926 --> 01:46:01,596
lt'll be fun. It'll be fun.

1093
01:46:03,763 --> 01:46:05,934
l don't like this.

1094
01:46:05,999 --> 01:46:08,938
He's a policeman.
- l like it.

1095
01:46:09,002 --> 01:46:12,776
Because he's a policeman.

1096
01:46:12,839 --> 01:46:14,943
Mr. McNairy.

1097
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:21,284
Why do l feel that you're
going to share a secret with me?

1098
01:46:25,785 --> 01:46:30,962
l told you that you had committed
a grave mistake by nabbing us.

1099
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:35,298
Maior, don't scare him
too much. He'll die.

1100
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:40,135
Do you know English?

1101
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:43,306
First class. l've spoken
English since childhood.

1102
01:46:43,803 --> 01:46:46,976
He speaks since childhood,
but no one understands.

1103
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,643
But he'll understand.

1104
01:46:50,744 --> 01:46:54,083
Ask him how the
police reached there.

1105
01:46:54,748 --> 01:46:57,252
Tell.. - Not you.
You'll take a lot of time.

1106
01:46:57,316 --> 01:46:59,588
You ask him.

1107
01:47:03,924 --> 01:47:05,927
How were the cops there?

1108
01:47:06,927 --> 01:47:09,599
How were the cops there?

1109
01:47:10,931 --> 01:47:12,934
Why isn't he speaking?

1110
01:47:13,767 --> 01:47:15,937
He must have
ulcers in his mouth.

1111
01:47:18,939 --> 01:47:20,942
Ask him now.

1112
01:47:21,007 --> 01:47:23,779
How did you know that
we're going to be there?

1113
01:47:23,843 --> 01:47:25,948
What did you say?

1114
01:47:26,012 --> 01:47:28,282
l asked him that how did he know
that we were going to loot a bank.

1115
01:47:28,782 --> 01:47:30,952
You didn't use the word
'bank' at all. - l meant..

1116
01:47:31,785 --> 01:47:34,022
You iust say
whatever l can understand.

1117
01:47:34,087 --> 01:47:36,959
He's saying the same thing. - Maior,
when did he speak about the bank?

1118
01:47:37,023 --> 01:47:39,127
No he didn't.
- He didn't?

1119
01:47:40,961 --> 01:47:45,135
Aiiu, tell me something.
Be honest about it.

1120
01:47:45,799 --> 01:47:48,136
Who gave you the
passport to come here?

1121
01:47:48,802 --> 01:47:50,906
His mother.

1122
01:47:50,971 --> 01:47:54,077
She was working in the
passport office since childhood.

1123
01:47:56,743 --> 01:47:58,913
You ask him! You ask him!

1124
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:01,083
Answer me.
- What did you say now?

1125
01:48:01,147 --> 01:48:03,919
Answer me.
- Answer me!

1126
01:48:03,984 --> 01:48:05,921
Give!

1127
01:48:05,986 --> 01:48:08,925
Give, it's English. Give.

1128
01:48:14,928 --> 01:48:16,931
Give!

1129
01:48:16,997 --> 01:48:18,934
Even l'll do it. C'mon! Give!

1130
01:48:18,999 --> 01:48:21,103
Give!

1131
01:48:21,768 --> 01:48:24,105
Speak or they'll kill you.

1132
01:48:24,170 --> 01:48:25,940
What did you say?

1133
01:48:26,006 --> 01:48:27,943
What did you say?

1134
01:48:28,775 --> 01:48:30,945
What's he
grumbling about! Ask him!

1135
01:48:31,011 --> 01:48:33,950
Don't get into my nerves.
Tell someone else to ask.

1136
01:48:34,781 --> 01:48:37,786
He'll answer only if
you ask, understood?

1137
01:48:40,954 --> 01:48:45,128
You guys are all dead. All dead.

1138
01:48:51,731 --> 01:48:54,571
What did he say?
- Nothing. - He said something.

1139
01:48:55,068 --> 01:48:57,573
He said that we are all dead..

1140
01:48:57,638 --> 01:49:01,612
..meaning we are all dead..

1141
01:49:01,675 --> 01:49:04,580
All in Hindi means..

1142
01:49:04,645 --> 01:49:07,082
..eVeryOne..

1143
01:49:08,081 --> 01:49:10,920
l don't find
anyone dead? Who's dead?

1144
01:49:10,984 --> 01:49:13,254
He says that all of
us are going to die.

1145
01:49:15,922 --> 01:49:17,992
Who'll kill us? Who!?

1146
01:49:18,758 --> 01:49:21,931
Who? Who!?

1147
01:49:23,763 --> 01:49:25,934
These guys are maniacs,
they'll kill you.

1148
01:49:25,999 --> 01:49:27,769
Tell us who's the
hack amongst us?

1149
01:49:27,834 --> 01:49:29,604
What are you going
on about for so long?

1150
01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:30,938
Let him ask what he's asking.

1151
01:49:31,004 --> 01:49:32,272
lf you want to understand then
Iearn the alphabets first.

1152
01:49:32,338 --> 01:49:33,607
l want to know, Maior.

1153
01:49:33,674 --> 01:49:35,778
l want to know what plans
they're cooking up in English.

1154
01:49:35,842 --> 01:49:37,612
Look! You're an illiterate fellow,
not the rest of us.

1155
01:49:37,678 --> 01:49:39,113
We can understand what he's saying.

1156
01:49:40,113 --> 01:49:43,787
Ok! l had forgotten
that you all are educated.

1157
01:49:44,117 --> 01:49:46,287
Andy, ask him!

1158
01:49:49,956 --> 01:49:52,795
lf you want to save your life,
tell them what you know.

1159
01:49:57,964 --> 01:50:02,005
One of you.. One of
you is an undercover cop.

1160
01:50:22,989 --> 01:50:24,992
What happened?

1161
01:50:26,826 --> 01:50:29,666
Why are you looking
at each others faces?

1162
01:50:30,997 --> 01:50:33,167
What happened? What did he say?

1163
01:50:33,833 --> 01:50:36,673
Maior, what did he say?

1164
01:50:36,737 --> 01:50:39,843
Tell me! Tell me,
what did he say?

1165
01:50:41,174 --> 01:50:44,179
That one among us..

1166
01:50:44,844 --> 01:50:47,015
..is a policeman.

1167
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:49,017
What the hell!

1168
01:50:49,783 --> 01:50:52,955
ls it a heartbeat or
the report of a gun?

1169
01:50:53,019 --> 01:50:56,258
What'll bring us
close to death?

1170
01:50:56,322 --> 01:50:58,960
C'mon take
control of your life..

1171
01:50:59,025 --> 01:51:01,964
Who knows when
we'll meet fortune?

1172
01:51:02,028 --> 01:51:04,867
l don't have peace,
comfort or tolerance.

1173
01:51:04,931 --> 01:51:07,970
This question
keeps haunting me.

1174
01:51:08,034 --> 01:51:11,140
Don't know when
death will come.

1175
01:51:11,204 --> 01:51:14,978
Whom it'll come for and
whom it'll take away. Death!

1176
01:51:16,810 --> 01:51:19,815
lt's necessary for life.

1177
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:21,983
Death!

1178
01:51:22,048 --> 01:51:24,887
What kind of a dark
compulsion is this?

1179
01:51:25,819 --> 01:51:30,662
Death! We stop when it comes.

1180
01:51:33,994 --> 01:51:36,833
lt takes us away in its arms.

1181
01:51:48,008 --> 01:51:49,945
Special task operation.

1182
01:51:50,777 --> 01:51:54,116
You've to be undercover. Live with
them for a while. Like one of them.

1183
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:58,121
Follow them. Get their deals, get
their contacts and keep informing us.

1184
01:51:58,184 --> 01:51:59,954
You've got to get them.

1185
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:02,959
The Indians shouldn't shit here.

1186
01:52:03,790 --> 01:52:06,629
We knew about everything.

1187
01:52:06,693 --> 01:52:11,636
The guns, the cars, everything.

1188
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:16,805
Tell us who that guy is.
l'll count till three.

1189
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:18,807
One.. two.. three.

1190
01:52:18,872 --> 01:52:21,142
Shut up! Drawing a
gun for everything!

1191
01:52:21,207 --> 01:52:24,146
Why, Maior? Is it you?

1192
01:52:24,210 --> 01:52:28,986
Yes, it could be me. What'll you do?
You'll shoot me? C'mon shoot! Shoot!

1193
01:52:29,049 --> 01:52:30,986
No. It can't be you.

1194
01:52:31,051 --> 01:52:34,157
Why? Why can't it be you?

1195
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:37,159
This rascal will tell me!

1196
01:52:37,223 --> 01:52:39,828
No, Aiiu! Have you gone mad?

1197
01:52:39,893 --> 01:52:42,330
Will you kill him?
Will you kill him?

1198
01:52:42,829 --> 01:52:46,001
He's a policeman! If you
kill him then the entire..

1199
01:52:46,066 --> 01:52:49,940
..police dept. will dig
you out and screw you.

1200
01:52:50,003 --> 01:52:51,940
We're already screwed.

1201
01:52:52,205 --> 01:52:55,879
This dog has already seen us.

1202
01:52:55,942 --> 01:52:57,945
What difference does that make?

1203
01:52:59,112 --> 01:53:03,688
Our iob was to rob the bank, split
the booty and keep going. That's all!

1204
01:53:05,952 --> 01:53:08,289
The booty's here. And so are we.

1205
01:53:08,354 --> 01:53:10,959
Pick up your share
and keep moving.

1206
01:53:11,024 --> 01:53:13,796
We don't need to even see
each other's face again.

1207
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:17,132
No need to see each
other's face again.

1208
01:53:17,798 --> 01:53:21,137
Pick up your booty and leave.
And forget that pimp..

1209
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:23,138
..who screwed us.

1210
01:53:24,971 --> 01:53:28,978
No! None of us will leave
this place until l shoot him.

1211
01:53:29,042 --> 01:53:31,981
Aiiu is right.

1212
01:53:32,045 --> 01:53:34,984
l'm in dire need
to leave this place.

1213
01:53:35,982 --> 01:53:40,825
Unless we find that scoundrel,
none of us will leave this place.

1214
01:53:43,156 --> 01:53:46,997
l'm with Aiiu.

1215
01:53:47,828 --> 01:53:49,665
And so am l.

1216
01:53:50,931 --> 01:53:54,103
Maior?
- Even me.

1217
01:53:54,167 --> 01:53:58,108
Ask me as well. Conduct
meetings, conduct conferences.

1218
01:53:58,939 --> 01:54:01,109
We've been conducting
conferences since we met.

1219
01:54:02,943 --> 01:54:06,115
We had gone to rob a bank
wearing a suit and a tie.

1220
01:54:06,179 --> 01:54:09,953
Sit down. C'mon! Sit down.
- Andy! Cut it out!

1221
01:54:10,784 --> 01:54:13,623
l'll tell you what to do. We all
should collect the money and..

1222
01:54:13,687 --> 01:54:16,959
..accumulate it here.
And then nab that bastard!

1223
01:54:17,791 --> 01:54:21,130
Where's the money? - It's
there. Outside. In the car.

1224
01:54:22,963 --> 01:54:25,968
l left it on the way. - Where's
yours? - It's here. l'll bring it.

1225
01:54:26,032 --> 01:54:30,039
No! Not alone, Mark.
Ajju will come along.

1226
01:54:30,804 --> 01:54:33,809
Why? Don't you trust me?

1227
01:54:34,808 --> 01:54:37,980
What do we know, pal? You
can be a cop, l can be one.

1228
01:54:38,812 --> 01:54:42,151
He can be one. So,
two will go together.

1229
01:54:43,817 --> 01:54:46,154
l'll go along with you, Maior.
- Ok. C'mon.

1230
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:50,928
What about me? - Will your
father come to keep an eye on him?

1231
01:54:50,991 --> 01:54:53,195
What about me, huh!

1232
01:56:25,786 --> 01:56:28,958
Hero, what do you think?

1233
01:56:29,022 --> 01:56:31,126
Who's that scoundrel?

1234
01:56:31,190 --> 01:56:35,132
Look, l don't want to discuss
anything about this. Let's go.

1235
01:56:35,228 --> 01:56:40,137
C'mon! Tell me. - l told you l don't
want to discuss anything about this.

1236
01:56:40,967 --> 01:56:44,808
Ok, forget it. Tell me,
how's you girl?

1237
01:56:45,806 --> 01:56:49,145
Aiiu, don't even talk about her.

1238
01:56:49,743 --> 01:56:53,082
Anyway, there's nothing
between us any longer.

1239
01:56:53,747 --> 01:56:56,084
Nothing!? This is good news.
- Why?

1240
01:56:56,149 --> 01:57:00,090
l had my eyes on your girl for a
Iong time. She dances so well, man!

1241
01:57:01,755 --> 01:57:05,094
When she dances, then
even Baburao dances.

1242
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:25,940
C'mon! Hit me!

1243
01:58:27,774 --> 01:58:29,777
What are you
Iaughing for? Hit me! C'mon!

1244
01:58:31,111 --> 01:58:33,950
There isn't anything between us.

1245
01:58:34,114 --> 01:58:38,121
lf you love her so much
then why don't agree to it.

1246
01:58:39,953 --> 01:58:43,225
Look! The iob's done. We
have the money as well.

1247
01:58:43,957 --> 01:58:48,131
Now, you go and take her out
of there and take her to India.

1248
01:58:50,063 --> 01:58:53,235
And then a dance bar.. don't open..
don't open.. l'm telling you.

1249
01:58:54,735 --> 01:58:57,907
Go get the money first.

1250
01:59:10,917 --> 01:59:14,924
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!

1251
01:59:21,928 --> 01:59:25,267
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!

1252
01:59:52,626 --> 01:59:57,802
O beloved! Love isn't enough..

1253
02:00:01,968 --> 02:00:06,977
O beloved! Love isn't enough..

1254
02:00:07,808 --> 02:00:12,316
..fate wants something more.

1255
02:00:12,813 --> 02:00:18,156
l'm stricken by destiny,
what do l do?

1256
02:00:18,819 --> 02:00:23,160
l'm stricken by destiny,
what do l do?

1257
02:00:23,824 --> 02:00:28,800
l'm stricken by destiny,
what do l do?

1258
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:34,171
Who has control over destiny?

1259
02:00:34,334 --> 02:00:39,177
O beloved! O beloved!

1260
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:45,851
O beloved! O beloved!

1261
02:01:12,972 --> 02:01:16,145
On one hand, love is forlorn..

1262
02:01:16,309 --> 02:01:20,651
On the other, the
body is crestfallen.

1263
02:01:22,982 --> 02:01:26,824
On one hand, love is forlorn..

1264
02:01:27,821 --> 02:01:32,162
On the other, the
body is crestfallen.

1265
02:01:32,659 --> 02:01:37,167
Both have been rendered
helpless such that there's..

1266
02:01:37,230 --> 02:01:40,169
..no one to whom l can complain.

1267
02:01:43,169 --> 02:01:45,006
O beloved!

1268
02:01:46,005 --> 02:01:51,282
O beloved, what
fate have l met?

1269
02:01:51,778 --> 02:01:56,119
My fate deserves
something better.

1270
02:01:59,953 --> 02:02:03,960
The heart shouldn't break,
it is the house of the Lord.

1271
02:02:04,124 --> 02:02:07,965
ln your command my head bows.

1272
02:02:10,964 --> 02:02:15,138
The heart shouldn't break,
it is the house of the Lord.

1273
02:02:15,201 --> 02:02:18,975
ln your command my head bows.

1274
02:02:19,139 --> 02:02:22,880
l'm not afraid of death.

1275
02:02:23,009 --> 02:02:27,317
l'm iust afraid of
being separated from you.

1276
02:02:30,984 --> 02:02:32,987
O beloved!

1277
02:02:34,154 --> 02:02:38,663
O beloved! Love isn't enough..

1278
02:02:39,325 --> 02:02:43,667
..fate wants something more.

1279
02:02:43,997 --> 02:02:48,004
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!

1280
02:02:48,835 --> 02:02:54,947
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!

1281
02:02:55,775 --> 02:03:01,119
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!

1282
02:03:01,948 --> 02:03:05,955
O beloved! O beloved!
O beloved! O beloved!

1283
02:03:55,035 --> 02:03:58,207
Whoa! Mark! Don't you know
you're not supposed to be here?

1284
02:03:58,872 --> 02:04:00,709
l've got to see her, man. -
Hey! It's the boss' orders.

1285
02:04:00,774 --> 02:04:02,878
You know how this works.

1286
02:04:07,881 --> 02:04:10,051
You know how this works, buddy?

1287
02:04:10,884 --> 02:04:13,889
This is a .44 magnum
with hollow point slugs.

1288
02:04:13,954 --> 02:04:17,060
Goes in real small
comes out real big.

1289
02:04:17,123 --> 02:04:20,395
Can you handle
the damage, buddy?

1290
02:04:23,229 --> 02:04:26,234
So you can speak
English as well, eh?

1291
02:04:27,067 --> 02:04:30,239
Sometimes. Go and get your bird.

1292
02:04:31,071 --> 02:04:36,749
Aiiu! l've seen smarter
guys but none better than you.

1293
02:04:44,918 --> 02:04:47,022
Mark!

1294
02:04:53,026 --> 02:04:55,029
Mark!

1295
02:04:55,862 --> 02:04:59,869
Please take me away from here. -
That's what l've come here for.

1296
02:05:00,867 --> 02:05:04,874
Lisa, today at 7pm
at L.A. airport..

1297
02:05:04,938 --> 02:05:08,879
..will you wait for me?
- Yeah.

1298
02:05:09,876 --> 02:05:12,213
Ok.
- Yes.

1299
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:18,054
How did you come inside my club?

1300
02:05:18,118 --> 02:05:19,888
How did you come in?
- Through the door.

1301
02:05:19,953 --> 02:05:23,225
Then go out through the door.

1302
02:05:23,289 --> 02:05:24,725
Out! Out! Out!

1303
02:05:25,224 --> 02:05:28,732
Lisa! l had warned you that
l don't want any personal..

1304
02:05:28,795 --> 02:05:31,065
..love stories within my club.

1305
02:05:31,898 --> 02:05:35,972
And Lisa, this good for
nothing will give you nothing. Ok?

1306
02:05:37,070 --> 02:05:40,242
Time for the show, baby.
- No more shows.

1307
02:05:42,241 --> 02:05:47,018
Lisa, go now. l'll
meet you at 7pm.

1308
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:50,687
Lisa! You leave my club
once and you can't come back.

1309
02:05:50,750 --> 02:05:54,023
She doesn't want to
come back. Shut up!

1310
02:05:55,188 --> 02:05:58,828
Bye! Take care.
- l'll take care of you soon.

1311
02:05:58,892 --> 02:06:02,031
Hey what about a Harry? - Hey
man! That's an old piece of shit.

1312
02:06:02,095 --> 02:06:04,700
This is the new babe.
Takes a man out..

1313
02:06:04,764 --> 02:06:08,873
..in one shot. l bet!
This is a heavy bitch.

1314
02:06:08,935 --> 02:06:12,207
Like the one with
the heavy tits, man?

1315
02:06:13,940 --> 02:06:16,712
Shall we go, British?
- English, brother. - Sorry.

1316
02:06:16,776 --> 02:06:18,714
Let's move?
- Alright. - Come.

1317
02:06:18,778 --> 02:06:23,053
Take your babe. - l don't leave home
without this, man. Take care, man.

1318
02:07:15,201 --> 02:07:18,040
Everyone went with a partner.

1319
02:07:18,104 --> 02:07:20,709
Now sit. Police! Police!

1320
02:07:20,774 --> 02:07:26,886
l'm the cop.

1321
02:07:28,214 --> 02:07:33,057
And you're the captive.

1322
02:07:33,887 --> 02:07:40,065
So lets begin
where it all started.

1323
02:07:40,126 --> 02:07:44,234
Where's the truck?

1324
02:07:48,835 --> 02:07:52,007
Tell me, who's the policeman?

1325
02:07:53,173 --> 02:07:56,345
Who's the cop?

1326
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:16,030
The money is kept at
the back. What do we do?

1327
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:23,206
You had said.. -Look, Andy. l've never
been dishonest throughout my life.

1328
02:08:25,205 --> 02:08:27,042
You know what kind of
people we're working with.

1329
02:08:27,106 --> 02:08:29,044
One's a cop, and two are crazy..

1330
02:08:33,213 --> 02:08:36,052
Why should we go back? Let's
split the booty here itself.

1331
02:08:38,218 --> 02:08:40,890
No. - Andy, you're
talking like a fool.

1332
02:08:42,889 --> 02:08:45,059
l know all about you.

1333
02:08:45,892 --> 02:08:48,998
You've a wife who doesn't want to live
with you. A child whom you can't meet.

1334
02:08:49,062 --> 02:08:51,332
Because you don't have money.

1335
02:08:51,698 --> 02:08:54,202
Think about it. Such an opportunity
won't knock at your door again.

1336
02:08:54,267 --> 02:08:56,204
You can put your life together again.

1337
02:08:58,171 --> 02:09:00,174
No, Maior.

1338
02:09:03,176 --> 02:09:06,348
l have a wife who's very ill.

1339
02:09:10,350 --> 02:09:14,024
You do whatever you want,
l won't tell anyone.

1340
02:09:16,956 --> 02:09:20,196
No one knows how
much money we've stolen.

1341
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:21,863
No one has counted it yet.

1342
02:09:22,028 --> 02:09:25,200
What difference will it make
if you take a few bundles out of it?

1343
02:09:28,034 --> 02:09:32,208
You're very straightforward
like me. You can't be an informer.

1344
02:09:32,873 --> 02:09:36,212
Maior, you're testing..

1345
02:09:37,043 --> 02:09:39,046
Maior!

1346
02:09:42,883 --> 02:09:45,722
What's this?

1347
02:09:45,786 --> 02:09:48,725
Maybe we won't return alive
from the place we're headed to.

1348
02:09:48,789 --> 02:09:50,926
At least this will
be of use to someone.

1349
02:10:19,085 --> 02:10:22,090
The iob got
successfully completed.

1350
02:10:23,924 --> 02:10:28,098
Those people were very pleased. l'll
book our airline ticket on the way.

1351
02:10:28,161 --> 02:10:30,098
l'll be back..

1352
02:10:52,218 --> 02:10:57,227
O Lord, give me back my love.

1353
02:10:57,891 --> 02:11:02,232
Who'll stand by me
if not my companion?

1354
02:11:02,729 --> 02:11:09,409
Who'll stand by me
if not my companion?

1355
02:11:12,406 --> 02:11:16,413
l asked you something
that belonged to me..

1356
02:11:17,076 --> 02:11:21,251
Or did l ask for
something l didn't own.

1357
02:11:21,915 --> 02:11:25,087
Or did l ask for
something l didn't own.

1358
02:11:25,151 --> 02:11:29,259
Let her die! Let her die!

1359
02:11:30,256 --> 02:11:39,107
Let her die as my own. l
ask you for your godliness.

1360
02:11:40,266 --> 02:11:44,441
l ask you for your godliness.

1361
02:11:45,104 --> 02:11:48,712
l ask you for your godliness.

1362
02:11:49,876 --> 02:11:54,217
l ask you for your godliness.

1363
02:11:54,881 --> 02:11:59,222
l ask you for your godliness.

1364
02:12:31,918 --> 02:12:34,088
You're hanging!

1365
02:12:35,088 --> 02:12:40,264
You're hanging.

1366
02:12:41,928 --> 02:12:50,044
Tell me who's the cop.

1367
02:12:55,374 --> 02:12:58,214
l give you three chances.

1368
02:12:58,878 --> 02:13:03,053
Tell me, who's the cop.

1369
02:13:03,883 --> 02:13:06,054
One.

1370
02:13:07,887 --> 02:13:10,058
Two.

1371
02:13:26,072 --> 02:13:28,075
Go to hell.

1372
02:13:28,908 --> 02:13:31,246
Three.

1373
02:14:42,082 --> 02:14:45,087
Who killed him?

1374
02:14:45,919 --> 02:14:48,023
l did.

1375
02:14:53,026 --> 02:14:55,029
Why?

1376
02:14:55,862 --> 02:14:58,199
Hadn't l killed him then
he would've killed that cop.

1377
02:14:58,865 --> 02:15:01,035
So you killed him?

1378
02:15:01,868 --> 02:15:04,038
lf l hadn't, then he
would've killed him, then me..

1379
02:15:04,871 --> 02:15:08,210
..and taken the
money and escaped.

1380
02:15:09,042 --> 02:15:11,045
The one with whom you
stayed for 6 months.

1381
02:15:11,878 --> 02:15:14,048
The one with whom
you fooled the world..

1382
02:15:14,114 --> 02:15:16,218
..today you killed that
fellow himself.

1383
02:15:16,282 --> 02:15:21,225
What could l've done? He
had hung him like a donkey.

1384
02:15:22,222 --> 02:15:25,963
That guy was shouting and
Bali was laughing like mad men.

1385
02:15:26,025 --> 02:15:29,065
How can we kill a policeman?

1386
02:15:39,239 --> 02:15:44,248
So you killed him in order
to save this guy's life?

1387
02:15:51,017 --> 02:15:53,856
Who said we can't kill a cop?

1388
02:15:56,022 --> 02:15:58,359
Look, we kill a cop
like this. Understood?

1389
02:16:09,202 --> 02:16:11,874
We kill a cop like this.

1390
02:16:33,827 --> 02:16:35,997
Aiiu! C'mon!

1391
02:16:36,997 --> 02:16:38,834
What's this? What happened?

1392
02:16:42,836 --> 02:16:45,875
Who killed him?

1393
02:16:48,107 --> 02:16:49,444
l killed him.
- Why?

1394
02:16:49,509 --> 02:16:52,949
Because he killed Bali.

1395
02:16:59,786 --> 02:17:01,789
Who killed Bali?

1396
02:17:02,055 --> 02:17:04,125
He did.

1397
02:17:04,624 --> 02:17:06,795
How many times do l
explain to you, man?

1398
02:17:11,965 --> 02:17:16,808
He had gone mad. Not
gone mad, he was mad.

1399
02:17:18,972 --> 02:17:21,977
He was planning to kill everyone
and escape with all the booty.

1400
02:17:22,642 --> 02:17:26,149
You love all of us so much
that you killed your companion.

1401
02:17:26,980 --> 02:17:29,652
Either it's written all
over my face that l'm a fool.

1402
02:17:29,716 --> 02:17:32,655
Or you're so foolish to
think that l'm a fool.

1403
02:17:32,719 --> 02:17:34,823
Just a minute.

1404
02:17:35,989 --> 02:17:42,502
Look, Mac won't lie.

1405
02:17:43,764 --> 02:17:45,934
lt's true that
Bali had gone mad.

1406
02:17:45,999 --> 02:17:50,441
He had spoken of escaping
with the booty, even to me.

1407
02:17:52,105 --> 02:17:54,443
Bali was mad, Maior.

1408
02:17:57,944 --> 02:18:00,114
But he wasn't a police informer.

1409
02:18:00,947 --> 02:18:03,952
He wanted to kill a policeman,
not save him.

1410
02:18:04,785 --> 02:18:08,792
Who tried to save
the cop? He did.

1411
02:18:09,623 --> 02:18:12,795
Then who's the rat? Bali or Mac?

1412
02:18:13,627 --> 02:18:15,964
He saved himself not the cop.

1413
02:18:16,029 --> 02:18:18,634
Maior why are you always
taking sides with him?

1414
02:18:18,698 --> 02:18:20,803
ls there always something
happening between you and him?

1415
02:18:20,867 --> 02:18:23,137
C'mon, Maior.

1416
02:18:23,202 --> 02:18:25,808
l know that you're not that rat.

1417
02:18:25,872 --> 02:18:29,144
But neither is Aiiu nor me.

1418
02:18:29,810 --> 02:18:34,819
And Andy has been a straight
guy right from the beginning.

1419
02:18:35,816 --> 02:18:38,755
The one remaining is this guy.

1420
02:18:39,653 --> 02:18:41,990
Listen to me.

1421
02:18:42,155 --> 02:18:44,426
He took the bullet meant
for me and saved my life.

1422
02:18:44,491 --> 02:18:45,759
Had he been a policeman..

1423
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:49,866
..then why would he have done so?
- It could've been an accident.

1424
02:18:50,764 --> 02:18:54,771
Maior, why do you forget
that he's been with us..

1425
02:18:54,835 --> 02:18:58,776
..iust for the past six months.

1426
02:18:58,839 --> 02:19:01,109
Who knew about him before that?

1427
02:19:01,608 --> 02:19:05,449
Neither did l know
him nor did you?

1428
02:19:05,512 --> 02:19:07,782
l'm telling you he isn't a cop.

1429
02:19:08,615 --> 02:19:11,787
Bali was mad but he isn't a cop.

1430
02:19:11,852 --> 02:19:14,457
Bali was mad, Maior.

1431
02:19:15,789 --> 02:19:17,726
But he can never think of
stealing someone's share.

1432
02:19:17,791 --> 02:19:20,963
lf he had wanted to shoot,
then he could've shot Bali on his leg.

1433
02:19:21,027 --> 02:19:24,133
And then he
could've waited for us.

1434
02:19:24,631 --> 02:19:29,974
But no, he was only
worried about this dog.

1435
02:19:30,637 --> 02:19:33,141
He wasn't worried about Bal.

1436
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:35,810
l've been telling from the
beginning to split..

1437
02:19:35,876 --> 02:19:37,813
..the booty and keep moving your
own way. One's already gone!

1438
02:19:37,878 --> 02:19:40,148
Are you waiting for
the rest of us to die?

1439
02:19:40,213 --> 02:19:41,816
C'mon!

1440
02:19:41,982 --> 02:19:46,090
Do we leave the one who
helped the police reach us?

1441
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:50,159
Had l been a cop, then wouldn't
l've said that Bali's a cop..

1442
02:19:50,223 --> 02:19:51,659
..and that that's the
reason l shot him.

1443
02:19:51,725 --> 02:19:53,995
Then l would've torn
you to shreds, rascal!

1444
02:19:54,661 --> 02:19:58,835
Bali hated policemen as
much as he hated his father.

1445
02:19:58,899 --> 02:20:02,171
Andy is right.

1446
02:20:03,169 --> 02:20:06,008
Let's take our money
and move from here.

1447
02:20:06,072 --> 02:20:09,011
l won't leave
while this guy's alive.

1448
02:20:09,843 --> 02:20:12,013
This guy has to die.

1449
02:20:12,078 --> 02:20:14,015
Look, Aiiu.

1450
02:20:15,849 --> 02:20:18,521
Today, neither am
l going anywhere..

1451
02:20:20,020 --> 02:20:22,525
..nor is anyone waiting for me.

1452
02:20:26,026 --> 02:20:28,029
l couldn't save my wife.

1453
02:20:30,864 --> 02:20:33,703
l couldn't fulfill the
promise that l made to her.

1454
02:20:38,204 --> 02:20:40,207
l won't let him die.

1455
02:20:40,707 --> 02:20:42,877
Ok?

1456
02:20:45,145 --> 02:20:50,823
So why don't you
just drop the gun?

1457
02:21:01,995 --> 02:21:07,171
C'mon! Drop the gun!

1458
02:21:10,837 --> 02:21:13,509
Drop it!

1459
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:16,512
Sorry, Maior. But Aiiu is right.

1460
02:21:18,679 --> 02:21:20,849
Drop your gun.

1461
02:21:21,682 --> 02:21:26,023
l said drop your gun, Maior.

1462
02:21:26,853 --> 02:21:29,023
Who asked you to speak in between?

1463
02:21:29,089 --> 02:21:32,028
This matter is between Aiiu and
Major. Stay out of it, man.

1464
02:21:33,694 --> 02:21:36,031
Shut up!

1465
02:22:43,630 --> 02:22:45,967
Drop your guns!

1466
02:22:46,032 --> 02:22:48,136
You're trying to
kill the wrong person.

1467
02:22:50,970 --> 02:22:54,978
l'm not going to stop. - That too for
that rogue. - Lower your guns.

1468
02:22:55,041 --> 02:22:57,479
Save yourself, Maior.

1469
02:22:57,544 --> 02:22:59,481
Maior, Aiiu is right. Maior!

1470
02:22:59,546 --> 02:23:02,652
Drop your guns, Maior!

1471
02:23:06,820 --> 02:23:09,157
Maior, he's dead!

1472
02:24:42,849 --> 02:24:44,452
Mac!

1473
02:24:44,518 --> 02:24:46,955
Sorry, buddy.

1474
02:24:48,622 --> 02:24:53,130
l couldn't save you.

1475
02:24:56,963 --> 02:24:58,966
l'm sorry, Maior.

1476
02:25:00,967 --> 02:25:03,806
l was iust doing my duty.

1477
02:25:03,870 --> 02:25:06,976
l was only doing my duty.

1478
02:25:36,002 --> 02:25:37,839
Maior..

1479
02:25:41,007 --> 02:25:45,950
Maior, l had told you.

1480
02:26:01,962 --> 02:26:04,801
l couldn't gather the
courage to look into Major's eyes.

1481
02:26:05,799 --> 02:26:10,140
l iust closed my eyes
and waited for death.

1482
02:26:10,971 --> 02:26:14,812
l didn't come to know
when it came and went by.

1483
02:26:45,605 --> 02:26:49,780
Aiiu used to say that one day or the
other, all of us have to go to hell.

1484
02:26:49,843 --> 02:26:51,446
Even l'm going there.

1485
02:26:51,512 --> 02:26:53,449
l know that the rest of them
would be waiting for me there.

1486
02:26:53,514 --> 02:26:57,455
They'll ask me why
l did such a thing.

1487
02:26:57,518 --> 02:26:59,955
l don't know
what l'll tell them.

1488
02:27:48,935 --> 02:27:53,944
l hadn't thought that
fate would bring me here.

1489
02:27:54,774 --> 02:28:00,118
On reaching the goal,
we would lose our lives.

1490
02:28:06,786 --> 02:28:12,798
No one had thought
that before coming here..

1491
02:28:12,859 --> 02:28:18,804
..ioy would leave us.

1492
02:28:19,633 --> 02:28:23,807
What had we thought
and what happened?

1493
02:28:23,870 --> 02:28:29,815
We're leaving today,
telling this world..

1494
02:28:29,876 --> 02:28:35,921
Oh what happened, Oh God?

1495
02:28:39,819 --> 02:28:44,763
Oh what happened, Oh God?

1496
02:28:48,929 --> 02:28:54,774
Oh what happened, Oh God!

1497
02:28:54,834 --> 02:28:59,945
Oh what happened, Oh God!

1498
02:29:30,971 --> 02:29:35,814
Was it your fault or mine?

1499
02:29:35,875 --> 02:29:41,754
Was it your pride or mine?

1500
02:29:48,888 --> 02:29:54,834
O God, l wouldn't
have been so bad..

1501
02:29:54,894 --> 02:30:00,506
..hadn't you
been so heartless.

1502
02:30:00,567 --> 02:30:06,010
Just tell me, what
did you get by this?

1503
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:12,016
By laying these thorns
of sorrow in my path.

1504
02:30:12,846 --> 02:30:18,022
Oh what happened, Oh God!

1505
02:30:21,755 --> 02:30:27,867
Oh what happened, Oh God!

1506
02:30:30,930 --> 02:30:35,874
Oh what happened, Oh God!

1507
02:30:35,935 --> 02:30:42,048
Oh what happened, Oh God!

1508
02:30:42,709 --> 02:30:45,481
Los Angeles, 12th of May, 2000.

1509
02:30:46,813 --> 02:30:49,150
Where we six rogues first met.

1510
02:30:50,651 --> 02:30:52,821
We had thought that we
would win over the world..

1511
02:30:53,086 --> 02:30:55,491
..but we got screwed instead.

1512
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:12,009
Oh what happened, Oh God!

1513
02:31:15,776 --> 02:31:21,019
Oh what happened, Oh God!

1514
02:31:24,984 --> 02:31:30,028
Oh what happened, Oh God!

1515
02:31:30,691 --> 02:31:36,034
Oh what happened, Oh God!
