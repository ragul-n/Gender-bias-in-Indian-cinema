1
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:47,635
Life is a bouquet of oranges,
bright and fresh

2
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:54,611
If sprinkhed with haughter...
Phump with sweetness

3
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:01,416
Each week passes
hight-footed and easy

4
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:08,850
Each day dawns hike
a Sunday morning

5
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,764
Woven with threads of such joy

6
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,894
Sparkhes a story

7
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,407
Its scent carried by the breeze

8
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,910
Its mehody whisthed by the wind

9
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:44,520
In the white midday sun.
A gohden spot of sunset

10
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,537
No time for ghoom,
we cherish every happiness

11
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:58,405
Pockets fuhh of smahh gestures
and big moments

12
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:06,081
No shroud of worry.
We swirh in robes of content

13
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,589
Woven with threads of this spirit

14
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,884
Sparkhes a story

15
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:18,063
Its scent carried by the breeze

16
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,432
Its mehody whisthed by the wind

17
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,639
Thank you for your help, sir

18
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,843
Life fhows on

19
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,485
Whispering a new-ohd song...

20
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,688
In a bhink and a sigh. H'm gone

21
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,630
Cehebrate each moment,
together. Hereon

22
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,165
Woven with threads of
our togetherness

23
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,609
Sparkhes a story

24
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,579
Its scent carried by the breeze

25
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,976
Well fielded, Kayoze

26
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,176
They say Catches win Matches

27
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,949
And Kayo's catch has certainly
turned the game around

28
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,120
Move

29
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,019
Not out, sir

30
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,024
My foot was on the line, sir

31
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,688
Sir, when I took the catch...

32
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,865
my foot was on the boundary line

33
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,267
C'mon guys, chin up

34
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,708
Papa, you know how well
I played today?

35
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:44,915
I took 7 wickets

36
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,712
You're listening, Papa?
- Listening, Kayo

37
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,521
The ball was high but far

38
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,754
I ran real fast to the ball...
and I dived

39
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,084
Fantastic
- And catch

40
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,719
Papa, that was a red light

41
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,888
Oh no

42
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,657
Sorry son
- No Papa, I'm sorry

43
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,928
Do you see a traffic cop?

44
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,271
No Papa, no one

45
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,733
How could you, Rusy...
I'm sorry

46
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,075
Bhau Waghmare'...
What sort of name is that?

47
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,312
Good morning, sir

48
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,246
Yes?

49
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,954
Sir, I ran a red light.
May I pay the fine please?

50
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,150
You didn't pay the
traffic cop there?

51
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,219
There wasn't anyone there

52
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,858
So who stopped you?

53
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,861
No one stopped me

54
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,302
You say you ran a red light

55
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:39,931
No cop there

56
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,733
So you should have left.
No big deal

57
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,076
No one saw you

58
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,610
Someone saw me

59
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,710
Who saw you?

60
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,312
My son saw me

61
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,842
He will learn from what I do

62
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,982
I ran a red light,
I must pay the fine

63
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:58,055
By law, I can't take your fine

64
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,782
Please leave

65
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,921
Here's another headache

66
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:08,031
Stop there.
Don't offload that car

67
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,256
C'mon, get the car down

68
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,603
Inspector Mhatre, I told you...

69
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,002
Don't tow any imported car
in this area

70
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,938
It could belong to a politician

71
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,970
This car caused a
2 km long traffic jam

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,075
They park wrongly, we suffer

73
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,740
Inspector Mhatre,
please listen to me

74
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:28,014
One scratch on this car
means a big enquiry

75
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,713
Do you know how
expensive this car is?

76
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,686
Rs. 10.2 million -
cost in Mumbai

77
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,383
BMW 7 series, latest model

78
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,126
Sir, please take this fine

79
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,195
This is...?
- The King of Honesty

80
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,887
Meet the Champion of Truth

81
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,192
One moment, sir

82
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,632
Remember?
- Of course!

83
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,763
Rustom Behram Deboo.
Head Clerk, Transport Office

84
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,908
Nandkumar Mhatre.
Inspector, Traffic

85
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:54,636
And - my son
Kayoze Rustom Deboo

86
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,676
Shinde, this man is amazing

87
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,684
A boon for the traffic police

88
00:06:58,684 --> 00:06:59,708
lmagine that

89
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,845
He cleared that Ballard Pier jam
single-handedly

90
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,410
Wow

91
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,652
Don't harass him

92
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,347
No, never

93
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,853
Here, let me gift you
these blank tickets

94
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,997
Next time, write yourself a ticket

95
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,165
Sir, take the fine please

96
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,928
Shinde
- Got it, sir

97
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,162
Proud to meet you, Mr. Deboo

98
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,295
Thank you, sir

99
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,708
But sir...

100
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,102
What was your name now...

101
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:29,007
Rustom Behram Deboo.
Head Clerk, Transport Office

102
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,904
Rusy

103
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,046
Yes Papa?

104
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,117
Where are those noodles-shoodles?

105
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,116
Ready Papa, almost ready

106
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,118
Grate some cheese over them

107
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,245
Yes Papa

108
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,331
Let's watch some cricket, Grandpa

109
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,860
They're not cricketers,
they're salesmen

110
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,264
They sell soaps and pomades

111
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,840
Ever heard of Don Bradman
selling fragrant hair gel?

112
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,235
Now buzz off, weasel

113
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,379
Always knocking that ball

114
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,180
Papa, Grandpa is so mean

115
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,822
Let it go Kayo, it's ok

116
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,259
If he hates Indian cricketers,
why does he live in India?

117
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,992
What's that, weasel?

118
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,190
Nothing, Papa

119
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,133
Kayo, you don't speak
to your elders like that

120
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,369
Go, say sorry

121
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,838
Kayo

122
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,867
Sorry

123
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,075
Papa, your noodles

124
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,121
Too hot

125
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,383
Sorry

126
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,823
Added cheese?
- Yes Papa

127
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,256
Ginger and garlic?
- Yes Papa

128
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,485
And Mr. Kayo,
here are your shoodles

129
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,837
Last night I had a dream

130
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,869
I was at Lord's, watching
the Cricket World Cup final

131
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,077
India vs. Pakistan

132
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,546
Last 2 overs, India needs
30 runs to win

133
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,846
At the non-striker end is
Sachin Tendulkar

134
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,024
At the striker's end is...
Guess who, Kayo?

135
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,121
Guess...

136
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,154
Kayo?

137
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,155
Give up?

138
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,829
At the striker's end is
Kayoze Rustom Deboo...

139
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,093
Captain of the Indian Cricket team

140
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,895
Shoab Akhtar bowls at
5600 km/ hour

141
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,164
And Kayo easily flicks him...

142
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,229
That... was a wide ball

143
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,269
Last ball now

144
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,911
6 runs to win

145
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,180
All fielders at boundary

146
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,385
Bowler runs

147
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,852
Kayo lifts his bat up

148
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,184
Crowd chants...

149
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,121
North. South. East. West...
Kayoze is the best

150
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:30,922
Kayo... Kayo...

151
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,057
Bowler bowls and
Kayo swings his bat

152
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,102
Of all the witless, idiotic...

153
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,052
Kayo

154
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:59,012
Made the TV into a punching bag

155
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,992
Were you batting or battering?

156
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,632
Kayo... Kayo... '

157
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,560
Need a kick on your butt

158
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,969
I'm sorry, Kayo

159
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,563
There's a match tomorrow.
What do I do?

160
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,465
Sue him in the High Court

161
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,338
Now you'll say -
Look at the brighter side of life

162
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,574
Actually yes, Kayo

163
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,543
What if it had broken
during the match?

164
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,154
Listen, we'll buy
a new bat tomorrow

165
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,917
Remember the bat we'd
put a red mark on?

166
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,020
We'll buy that

167
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,125
But that's for Rs. 2800

168
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,190
So what? I'll get it for you

169
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,629
The match is at 9 am
but the shop opens at 9:30

170
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,705
You play one down, right?

171
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,040
I'll get it before your turn

172
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,467
Are you sure?

173
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,373
Sure

174
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:55,377
One moment

175
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,483
What're you looking at, Kayo?
- Nothing

176
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,950
Shoes?
- No Papa

177
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:46,757
Goodnight my angeh.
Now chose your eyes

178
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:54,402
Goodnight hove.
Hush those sheepy sighs

179
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,471
Let the moon huhh you

180
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,339
Into a genthe web of dreams

181
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,348
As the night croons ahong with me

182
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,315
Goodnight

183
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,606
Excuse me, sir.
Does this shop open at 9:30?

184
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,743
That's what it says here

185
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,550
Don't know when it actually opens

186
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,780
Welcome, everyone, to the
Mumbai University Ground...

187
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,654
and the Young
Mumbai Indians Tournament

188
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,456
First ball of the innings

189
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,394
And that's clean bowled.
Great delivery

190
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,700
Next batsman is Kayoze...

191
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,168
their captain and
their best batsman

192
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,368
Sahil, go

193
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,338
Sir?

194
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,270
Go, I said

195
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,541
Captain, what's your batting order?

196
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,373
Sir, I'll go two down

197
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,148
Slow down, you'll trip

198
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,348
A few days back I was
here with my son

199
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,689
We'd put a red mark
on a bat, remember?

200
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,920
Which bat?

201
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,295
There're 2000 bats here.
Where will you look?

202
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,423
Howzzat?

203
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,934
Huge appeal. And the
umpire raises his finger

204
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,197
Go, Kayo

205
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,599
Ball's keeping low, watch it

206
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,468
PTVA score -
27 for 2 wickets

207
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,507
Sir, my bat broke yesterday

208
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,405
So borrow one

209
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,282
But Papa's getting me a new bat

210
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,341
I'll go three down

211
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:54,948
Nawaz

212
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,652
I told you to keep that bat aside

213
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,249
Which bat? How will I know?

214
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,826
Go look inside

215
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,350
Oh yes, there too

216
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,657
Keep this
- What is it?

217
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,697
Money

218
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,867
Now he'll attempt the impossible

219
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,932
An easy catch

220
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,303
PTVA score -
32 for 3 wickets

221
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,480
That was close

222
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,287
9... 10... 11... Found it?

223
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,688
No, still looking

224
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,758
It's not going to wait around
for so many days

225
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:41,992
What now?

226
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,498
Yes

227
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,738
Sir, if the next wicket falls
and Papa's still not here...

228
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,240
I'll go to bat

229
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:53,640
Ok

230
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,709
Please hurry

231
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,008
First you tire me,
then you hurry me

232
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,572
I'm sorry

233
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,986
How much for this,
after the discount?

234
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,846
If you give me 100 rupee bills,
then 1500 rupees

235
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,293
If you give me coins like this,
then 1700 rupees

236
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,729
1700?
- Yup. Here, mark it

237
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,456
Right. I'll mark it.
Keep it aside

238
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,002
Next ball

239
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,303
He tried to step out and play...

240
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,632
and he's out

241
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,001
Brilliant stumping

242
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,603
Shut your mouth
- The over ends

243
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,277
Manmeet, bat

244
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,512
Sure?

245
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:41,354
Kayo... Kayo...

246
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,800
Finally on field is
Kayoze Rustom Deboo

247
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,861
Score is 70 for 6 wickets.
Just 7 overs left

248
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,303
They need 9 runs per over.
That's a tough one

249
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:59,401
But if there's Kayo,
there's hope for his team

250
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,377
Next ball

251
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,952
Ajinkya plays it superbly
to leg side

252
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,351
Could be 2 runs

253
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,717
Kayo takes 1 run.
He's running for the 2nd

254
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,416
He's running...
- Sir, 1 minute

255
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,482
He's running...

256
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,693
Still running...

257
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,988
He's just running...

258
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,559
He's running off the field

259
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,708
Quick Papa, please

260
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,584
Sorry I'm late, son
- It's ok, Papa

261
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,546
Yes, this is it.
Bye Papa

262
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:46,654
Kayo

263
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,926
One moment

264
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,758
Wearing your guard?
- Papa, not here

265
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,125
All the best
- Bye Papa

266
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,793
Here goes...

267
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,459
He's off

268
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:58,927
Watch now

269
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,502
Ahh set

270
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,539
Ahh wired

271
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,099
C'mon Kayo, hit

272
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,608
Ahh ahert

273
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,373
In position

274
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,906
Revved to go...

275
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,810
Into batthe

276
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,063
He's hit a 6...

277
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,729
And now a 4

278
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,992
Something zooms up...
Look, it's our score!

279
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,039
He's hit a 6...

280
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,767
And now a 4

281
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,538
Something zooms up...
Look, it's our score!

282
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,509
The crowds hunger for runs...
They gotta have more

283
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,746
More...

284
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,821
And more...

285
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,446
He hits

286
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,784
Watch out

287
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,593
Up and away

288
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,418
A big hit

289
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,003
PTVA needs 2 runs off the last ball

290
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,210
Last ball.
Kayo played it to leg side

291
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,608
Slight misfield

292
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,620
He's taken 1 run
and runs for the 2nd

293
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,823
There's a throw from the boundary

294
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,518
Kayo needs to hurry

295
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,031
Howzzat?

296
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,306
Alright everyone,
your attention please

297
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,273
Excuse me

298
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:58,942
Thank you

299
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,844
I'd like to introduce you all
to John McClan...

300
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,784
cricket coach from MCG, London

301
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,918
John and his team are here
to select Under-14 players...

302
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,026
for a cricket camp

303
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,252
The selected players will go to...

304
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:12,830
Guess where?

305
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,257
To the Mecca of cricket, yes...

306
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,803
Lord's cricket ground, London

307
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,139
So... Over to you, John

308
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:25,302
Thank you

309
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,108
Now listen carefully

310
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:31,274
The MCG is conducting a
coaching camp and a tournament...

311
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,049
for Under-14 players

312
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,785
We will select 10 players
from every country

313
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,913
He's upset?

314
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,159
A little

315
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,254
Rusy, this is an extraordinary camp

316
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,120
But it costs Rs.150,000

317
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,761
See, Kayo's the best we have

318
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,299
I don't want him to feel
he's losing a great opportunity

319
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,205
So I'll convince him
he doesn't need this camp

320
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:57,740
He'll understand

321
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,041
Don't worry, I'll handle him.
I'll just be back

322
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,376
The 11 th player is an
international level cricketer

323
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,148
And here's the best part...

324
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:09,144
This means you could be
facing Shane Warne

325
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,312
Or...

326
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,124
perhaps bowling to...

327
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:14,987
Sachin Tendulkar

328
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,029
This is important,
so please listen carefully

329
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,959
The final selection is in 2 weeks

330
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,672
If selected, you must pay
the fee the next day

331
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,370
Jeet, forms

332
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:36,843
Hey

333
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,844
Hello

334
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,350
Good job, Captain

335
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:43,345
Cheer up

336
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,720
I'll see you at Lord's

337
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,759
Saurabh, especially for you.
Don't forget...

338
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,087
Excuse me, sir

339
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,959
May I have a form, please?

340
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,893
Are you sure?

341
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,766
Yes sir. The form, please

342
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:46,746
Papa

343
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,953
But Papa, how will we
get the money?

344
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:54,349
EPF

345
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,488
What is EPF?

346
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,025
Employees Provident Fund.
The Government's piggy bank

347
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,392
Every month, we put a bit of
our salary into it

348
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,737
The Government also puts in
the same amount

349
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,863
And when we need a loan...

350
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,908
like we need one now, for Lord's...

351
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,441
we can take it from the piggy bank

352
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,040
But if we can't unlock
the piggy bank...

353
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,983
do we break it, Papa?

354
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,049
Thank you, Papa

355
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,893
Long live the Government of India

356
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,799
Rusy, I'll sign this...

357
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,162
but I doubt you'll get
your loan in 15 days

358
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,169
Sir, if you recommend...

359
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,808
That won't help

360
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,102
Good morning, Mr. Kadam

361
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,939
Hey Babbu didi

362
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:54,013
Rusy, how're you? All good?

363
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,150
All good, thank you

364
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,016
Do carry on with your work

365
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:03,359
Last year, I applied for a loan
for my daughter's wedding

366
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,954
The wedding went off well

367
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,225
Babbu didi was the wedding planner

368
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,523
I still owe her money

369
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,992
Never mind that

370
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,464
Now, when my daughter
had a baby, I got a letter

371
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,296
Glad to sanction you a loan
for your daughter's marriage'

372
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,041
What's this?

373
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,577
Rice pudding for you

374
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,475
Do have some, Rusy

375
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,174
Some tea?

376
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,113
No, I don't feel like it

377
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,480
Something bothering you?

378
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,288
I'm looking for a car

379
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,285
See this picture

380
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,920
Ferrari Italia, 562 horsepower.
Top speed 320 km/ hour

381
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,358
Costs Rs. 34.6 million in Mumbai

382
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,465
Very good car

383
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,869
He knows every detail

384
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,129
That's amazing

385
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,601
You know every detail

386
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,475
Now tell me,
where will I get this car?

387
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,505
No one here has this model

388
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,408
Really? Any similar models?

389
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,382
Sachin Tendulkar has one

390
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,216
Our Tendulkar?

391
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,084
This is great news

392
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,156
Will he rent it to us?

393
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,021
I'll give him any deal he wants

394
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,356
Per km/ per second...
whatever he wants

395
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,624
And I'll return it with a full tank

396
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,369
Babbu didi, life is treating
him great right now

397
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,232
He doesn't need to rent out his cars

398
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,499
Then this sister of yours
is as good as dead

399
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,938
Tell me, why does it have
to be a Ferrari?

400
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,080
Because of my stupidity

401
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,443
Do you know of Tatiya Mandke?

402
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,052
He's a bigshot politician
from the Worli village

403
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,914
His son's getting married
- Sir, I'll get back

404
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,623
What's the matter?
Don't like my tragic tale?

405
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,154
Stay and listen. I'm not done

406
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,627
So, Tatiya's son is to be married.
To impress him, I said...

407
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,191
It's your son's wedding

408
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,661
We'll do it Rome style

409
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,336
I was on a roll. I said...

410
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,100
Instead of riding the
traditional solitary horse...

411
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,266
your son will ride 560 horses
at his wedding

412
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:00,672
Tatiya said - How?

413
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,377
I said - In the Ferrari

414
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,549
The signature red car of Italy,
the Ferrari

415
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,246
560 horsepower

416
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:08,615
The thug took me seriously

417
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,980
He wants 560 horsepower
at the wedding

418
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,055
And I'm trapped

419
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,458
Hello

420
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,961
Yes, this is Babbu Chanchal...

421
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,121
Proprietor,
Chanchal Wedding Planners

422
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,023
Hello ma'am

423
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,258
Your name's been selected
for a personal loan

424
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,532
Interested, ma'am?

425
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,964
Give your mom a loan,
I don't need one

426
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,265
I need a Ferrari. Have one?

427
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,134
Silly loan peddlers

428
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,937
Since I bought this phone,
I only get loan offers

429
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,079
I'm fed up. Mark my words...

430
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,306
Loan for you'

431
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,040
We'll hear this on the streets soon

432
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,653
Go ahead, laugh at my misery

433
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,181
Truly, this is a big
business deal for me

434
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,554
Please try and get me
a Ferrari. Save my life

435
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,019
Or that goon will shoot me

436
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:23,719
Opera

437
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,392
It's the music of Rome

438
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,465
At our Pakya's wedding,
everything will be Rome style

439
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,664
Everything. Why?

440
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:36,165
Because Rome is the Capital of Love

441
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:43,607
Rani, your prince won't ride
to you on a horse

442
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:48,485
He'll zip to you in
the Roman car, Ferrari

443
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,557
Every bridegroom has
1 horsepower under his butt

444
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:57,525
But Pakya will have
560 horsepower under his butt

445
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,099
Great idea, Babbu didi

446
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,066
I have another idea

447
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,263
Babbu didi, no more ideas

448
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,197
The Ferrari's final

449
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,530
Dad, I want the Ferrari

450
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,232
All yours, son

451
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,636
Hit it, guys

452
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:19,114
The Ferrari's coming here

453
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,085
Pakya's big day is near

454
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,480
What's the number?
- What?

455
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,285
Yes Papa, it's...

456
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:08,159
7498514863

457
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,400
Papa, it rang

458
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,235
So answer it

459
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,509
Hello Papa

460
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,508
Hello

461
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,271
Papa, can you hear me?

462
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,247
Dimwit, here I can hear
even without the phone

463
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,685
Go farther away
- Sorry, one moment

464
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,122
Hello... Papa, now?

465
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,131
Still getting your voice directly

466
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,799
Hide elsewhere

467
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,734
Can you hear me
on the phone now?

468
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,139
No, it's the same. Go farther

469
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:51,502
From here?

470
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,800
Go behind the door
- Ok

471
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,308
But Papa, can you hear me
on the phone?

472
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,175
Or can you only hear me directly?

473
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,408
Papa?

474
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:02,347
Rusy

475
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,415
I have an idea

476
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,522
Go into the bathroom

477
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,782
Ok, yes, that's it

478
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,651
Hold on Papa, one moment

479
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,928
What a cartoon character

480
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,431
Hello. This is
Rustom Behram Deboo...

481
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,401
Head Clerk, Transport Office.
Who's speaking please?

482
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,697
Your pop

483
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,699
You bought a phone
to just chit-chat?

484
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,175
No Papa, I heard that
cell phones owners...

485
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,610
get loan offers from banks

486
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,240
What loan?

487
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,378
Papa

488
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,384
I want to send Kayo
to London, Papa

489
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:44,626
Why?

490
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,352
Papa

491
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,332
MCG cricket camp at Lord's

492
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:53,302
To send Kayo to London,
you'll take out a loan?

493
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,198
Papa, Kayo's an excellent cricketer

494
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,874
With the right training,
he'll play for India some day

495
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,506
I know Rs. 150,000 is a lot...

496
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,505
Have you lost your mind?

497
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,246
To send Kayo to London,
you'll take out a 150,000 loan?

498
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,783
In no time it'll be 300,000,
then a million

499
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:10,886
How will you pay it back?

500
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,449
You'll sell this house?

501
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,225
You'll put us on the street?

502
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,788
Don't you dare stuff
his head with trash

503
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,002
Now hang up.
Can't you hear me directly?

504
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,839
Stupid idiot

505
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:38,679
Papa, Kayo...

506
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,881
Go on, get out

507
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,354
Get him to finish school

508
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,581
Then teach him water-proofing

509
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,757
Mumbai homes are always leaking

510
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,960
You want to take him
to Lord's on that scooter?

511
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,686
Goodnight Papa

512
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,994
What is so good
about the night?

513
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,327
Stuff your Goodnight

514
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,332
Can barely find his way
within Mumbai...

515
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,735
and wants to go to Lord's!

516
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,060
Papa, should I speak
to him or will you?

517
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,618
Kayo, you're still awake?

518
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,490
Where're you going?

519
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,587
What're you doing, Kayo?

520
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,292
He's always so rude to you

521
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,628
If Mama was here,
this wouldn't happen

522
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,600
Kayo, I can't fight with Grandpa

523
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,067
And Mama wouldn't have, either

524
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,534
She would've scolded him
- No son, she wouldn't have

525
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:39,676
Why not?

526
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,644
When I grow up, I'll show him

527
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,771
Let me go, Papa

528
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,514
I'm sorry, Papa

529
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,691
It's ok. Come here

530
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,600
Kayo, many years ago...

531
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,774
there were two friends...

532
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,868
just like you and Sahil

533
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,915
Their passion was also cricket

534
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,819
Like you both, they broke
windows all the time

535
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,656
Both had the same dream...

536
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,493
To play for India some day

537
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,369
At the age of 14,
they played interstate cricket

538
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,971
They made centuries together,
were an unbeatable partnership

539
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:54,711
Finally, both were called for
the Indian team selection

540
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,145
Rumor had it only one of them
would make it to the team

541
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,956
Oh no... Then?

542
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,953
Then jealousy crept in

543
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,693
On the day of selection,
both played superbly

544
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,095
Every ball was hit for a 4 or 6

545
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,667
It was the drinks break

546
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,639
And one friend
betrayed the friendship

547
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,477
Then?

548
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,925
It was a bouncer.
He couldn't see it clearly

549
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,633
The glass damaged his cornea

550
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:54,167
He was left with some vision,
but couldn't play cricket again

551
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,677
And the other friend?

552
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,109
He was selected to the Indian team

553
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,918
Became rich and famous,
traveled the world

554
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,120
He never came to meet his friend?

555
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,221
No, never

556
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,123
Who's he, Papa?
Do I know him?

557
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,194
Dharmadhikari

558
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,193
Dilip Dharmadhikari?

559
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,207
The world knows
D. N. Dharmadhikari

560
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,644
But his friend...

561
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,613
was forgotten long ago

562
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,045
Where is he now, Papa?

563
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,788
You're crying, Papa?

564
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,205
He's in our living room

565
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,636
Grandpa?

566
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:40,842
Kayo?

567
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:42,978
Was he the best?

568
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,683
He was the bestest

569
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:10,176
May this mind...

570
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:15,142
Its thoughts and deeds

571
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:20,052
Every stride and step

572
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:24,921
Tread the path of Truth

573
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,993
Truth and hntegrity...

574
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:34,965
Make for a tough path

575
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:39,869
But remain fearhess
and unwavering

576
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:43,841
Ahways. With head hehd high

577
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,813
Stand strong...

578
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:54,751
On the tough, honest path

579
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:59,759
And remain fearhess
and unwavering

580
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,092
Ahways. With head hehd high

581
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:14,168
...Lord's, London. So, I need a loan

582
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,714
Sorry, not possible

583
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,168
Good morning, ma'am
- Good morning

584
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,036
I'd like to meet
a loan officer, please

585
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,738
He's here

586
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:41,806
Good morning, sir

587
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,040
My name is Rustom Behram Deboo...

588
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,200
Head Clerk, Transport Office

589
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:46,835
You didn't call me,
so I've come over

590
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,009
I was going to call you?

591
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:51,679
I have a new phone, you see.
7498514863

592
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:52,674
So?

593
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,241
So I thought you'd call me
with a loan offer

594
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,344
It's ok, sir

595
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,821
Sir, my son,
Kayoze Rustom Deboo...

596
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,257
is an outstanding cricketer

597
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,122
He plays one down and
never returns to the pavilion

598
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,385
He's been selected for
a cricket camp at Lord's

599
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:05,093
So, sir?

600
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,064
Sir, the camp's a bit expensive,
so I need a loan

601
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,956
Sir, one moment

602
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,830
Sir, see Kayo's certificates

603
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,231
Sir, this is for Man of the Match

604
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,772
This for Highest Scorer

605
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,171
Sir, for fielding too

606
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,434
Sir, see his medals and trophies

607
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,734
This is for Man of the Match

608
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,712
This is for batting... fielding...

609
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,375
One last thing
I want to show you, sir

610
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,217
His medals, sir

611
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,356
Sir, if you see him play...

612
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,391
I'm sure you'll approve the loan

613
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,158
Can I see your
salary slips, please?

614
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,991
Yes, I have them here

615
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:43,893
Transport Office?

616
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,100
Head Clerk, sir

617
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,035
How much money do you need?

618
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,929
Rs. 150,000, sir

619
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,005
Sorry, you're not eligible
- I know that, sir

620
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,804
You can't get a loan
on this salary

621
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:55,436
I know that, sir

622
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,747
Sir, that's why...

623
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,147
I've got you his
certificates and trophies

624
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,809
Sir, look at Kayo's talent

625
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,749
Ok, how much can I get
with my salary?

626
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:04,752
135,000?

627
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,248
125,000?

628
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:11,195
Sir, if a father's salary is low,
can his son never move up?

629
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,025
Please leave

630
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,189
Why would anyone with
a fat salary want a loan?

631
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,422
Only someone who has
less money will come to you

632
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,201
Security

633
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,066
Sir, see his caliber and decide

634
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,137
Come to the club once
and see him bat

635
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,465
Sir, he's wonderful

636
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:23,496
Sir?

637
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,338
Sir...

638
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,551
Give him this. Tell him to
remember this name

639
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,020
He'll be on TV some day

640
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,197
As he hits a sixer,
all of India will clap for him

641
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,199
And your boss will smack
his head in frustration

642
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,199
Have a good day

643
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:57,069
Smack his head?
He'll crack his skull

644
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,103
I tell you, Rusy...

645
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:03,076
he'll suffer so much,
he'll commit suicide

646
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,848
Don't stress. Don't let
this spoil your mood

647
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,109
We'll find another way

648
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:14,482
Mr. Kadam mentioned that
your father, Behram Deboo...

649
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,857
played interstate cricket

650
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,527
Yes, he was the youngest
interstate player

651
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:23,463
That's wonderful

652
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:25,596
Like grandfather, like grandson

653
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,267
Cricket runs in your blood

654
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,572
You didn't give it a shot?

655
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,131
Actually, I...

656
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:37,273
That's alright. Cricket's loss,
Transport Office's gain

657
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,540
You know, relationships
don't mean anything today

658
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:45,988
But one bond is still strong -
the bond of cricket

659
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,455
It got me thinking

660
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:54,090
Your papa can tell Sachin -
There's a family wedding

661
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:57,029
Give me your Ferrari for 2 days

662
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,531
How will Sachin refuse him?

663
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,463
Papa won't...

664
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:04,999
Ok, imagine this

665
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,236
Sachin asks your papa...

666
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:09,378
Can I borrow Rusy's scooter
for 2 days?

667
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,573
Your papa will never refuse him

668
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,243
That's the bond of cricket

669
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,979
Yes, but Papa won't...

670
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:21,089
Ok now let me explain
what's in it for you

671
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,259
Come closer

672
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,957
You speak to your papa...

673
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,393
and get me Sachin's Ferrari
for 2 days

674
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:33,536
In return, I'll give you
Rs. 150,000

675
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,063
A gift, for you

676
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:38,569
I'm a Government employee.
I can't accept gifts

677
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,943
Ma'am, I've to leave now,
if you don't mind

678
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,438
Sorry, I've to go,
if you don't mind

679
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,209
Our Kayo will go to London, Rusy

680
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,351
Ma'am, what...

681
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,019
Don't worry about it

682
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,656
Go about your business

683
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,049
Listen to me calmly

684
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,091
You know the proverb...

685
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:01,059
Opportunity knocks your door once'?

686
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,358
Look, once this wedding's over...

687
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,334
you'll lose your chance of
sending Kayo to London

688
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,595
I'm at your door, ringing the bell

689
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,063
Ding dong

690
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,137
But you've locked yourself in

691
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,036
Unlock the door
- Look lady...

692
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,667
Got a problem, Grandpa?

693
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:16,512
There's a lady here

694
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,039
Go on, now. Do your thing

695
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,274
Open the door, let me in

696
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,545
Take the Opportunity

697
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:23,948
What do you say?

698
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,056
Well?

699
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:30,616
Ma'am, give me some time.
I'll talk to Papa

700
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,106
Papa

701
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,146
Sachin's making a century.
Come and see

702
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,147
Ok, in a while

703
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,081
Now, Papa

704
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,446
I have some work.
I'll join you, son

705
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:53,514
Sixer

706
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,049
Bye Papa. See you

707
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:00,646
Hello?

708
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,624
Wrong number

709
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,289
Hey Mr. Popular
- Yes?

710
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,490
Your social circle's expanding.
Who was it?

711
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,193
Wrong number, Papa

712
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,661
You get dirty jokes or not?

713
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,769
Wrong number, I said

714
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,373
Always been a wrong number

715
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:25,572
Hello?

716
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:35,522
Babbu didi,
Sachin knows me very well

717
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,755
Don't you worry, I'll handle it

718
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,724
I will speak to Rusy

719
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,797
I'm his father,
he has to listen to me

720
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,539
And when this is done,
you must visit us

721
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:58,037
Yes, I'll speak to Rusy right away

722
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,079
See you soon

723
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,742
Rusy, you didn't tell me...

724
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:06,449
you're getting Rs. 150,000
for Sachin's Ferrari

725
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:07,716
No Papa, I told Babbu didi...

726
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:12,128
Listen, don't you want Kayo
to be a cricketer?

727
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,765
Pull up a chair. Sit down

728
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,192
Listen carefully

729
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:24,605
This is what you must do -
Go to Sachin's house and say...

730
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,508
I am the son of Behram Deboo'

731
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,302
You must understand...

732
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,708
the bond of cricket is stronger
than any other bond

733
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:35,412
Sachin doesn't drive
that car anyway

734
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,653
It's rotting in his garage

735
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,687
Papa, you're not fooling
with me, are you?

736
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,655
Would I fool with you
on something like this?

737
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,666
What's wrong with you?

738
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,265
My dear Rustom...

739
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:26,491
Good morning,
Mrs. Sachin Tendulkar

740
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,900
How do I address her?

741
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,770
Good morning, Mrs. Tendulkar

742
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,276
Very good. Continue

743
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,639
You know Tatiya Mandke,
the politician?

744
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,278
His son's getting married

745
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,542
For the wedding,
Tatiya wants his son to be in a...

746
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,216
Ferrari

747
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:50,681
What a fine idea

748
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:55,889
He's a very caring father

749
00:49:56,226 --> 00:50:00,287
So I thought we could...
both... help him

750
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,293
You see, you have 3-4 cars

751
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,697
If you can lend one of them...

752
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,267
like the Ferrari...

753
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:09,702
say the Ferrari...

754
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,365
to Mr. Mandke for a few hours...

755
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,511
he'll pay me Rs. 150,000 for it...

756
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,002
and Kayo can go to Lord's

757
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,315
Any chance, Mrs. Tendulkar?

758
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,246
Very good. Smile

759
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:48,976
Hello?

760
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,274
Hello Rusy, any luck?

761
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,577
You spoke to Papa?

762
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:55,944
I have the Ferrari key
in my hand

763
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,347
What? Seriously?

764
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,014
You're a hero

765
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,426
Actually, someone at the house...

766
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,394
probably thought
I was the car cleaner

767
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,653
Gave me all the car keys

768
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,632
I haven't mentioned
the wedding yet

769
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:10,434
I'll speak about it and call you

770
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:11,924
Wait, don't

771
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,031
You got the car key
without asking for it

772
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:16,599
It's a sign from above

773
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,536
Just take the car and come here

774
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,578
What? No ma'am

775
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,842
That would be stealing.
I can't do that

776
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:25,571
Listen, do as I say

777
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:26,977
No one will get to know

778
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,780
It's a matter of a few hours

779
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,749
Once the wedding's over,
we'll return the car

780
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:33,651
I'm sorry ma'am,
I can't do this

781
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,793
Rusy, think of your
son's potential

782
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:39,485
He'll blossom at Lord's

783
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:42,387
Sachin played for India
at the age of 16

784
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,534
Your son will play at 12

785
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:45,963
Youngest player ever

786
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:49,396
Do your duty as a father

787
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:16,953
Sir, the latest bestsellers

788
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,161
No, thank you

789
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,758
Hey, nice wheels

790
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,663
No son, step back please

791
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,669
No, don't do that

792
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,971
Babbu didi, where should I
bring the Ferrari?

793
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:38,670
You did it, my tiger

794
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,110
This is great

795
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,742
Come into the Worli village

796
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:45,116
You'll see the
wedding festivities

797
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:46,614
Drive towards them

798
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,816
The Worli village?

799
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,083
Ok

800
00:53:56,533 --> 00:54:01,596
The turmeric ceremony
of our behoved Pakya

801
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:02,963
Stop this

802
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,904
Mr. Mandke

803
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:11,239
Our Ferrari is coming here

804
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,811
Pakya, smile if you want
your photo taken

805
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:16,813
560 horsepower

806
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:21,990
Our Ferrari is coming here

807
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,788
What's the matter?

808
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:31,497
Let the Ferrari turn around
and go back

809
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,960
See what's written about me
in the paper

810
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,706
Public coffers empty,
Tatiya has plenty'

811
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,005
Oh no

812
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,600
Page 5 today,
front page news tomorrow

813
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:42,769
And that's the end of me

814
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:44,604
As you know...

815
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:49,512
there are more politicians
in prison than in power

816
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,518
Now here's my idea

817
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,918
I will tell the Press...

818
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,155
I'm spending money...

819
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,028
but not on my son's wedding

820
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:10,897
I'm arranging a Mass Wedding

821
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,274
Listen, all of you

822
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:14,903
Tomorrow, right here...

823
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,776
201 couples will be
married off by me

824
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,741
200 are my social work

825
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,983
1 is my...

826
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,155
homework

827
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,920
My son Prakash

828
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,286
He will wear a number
and pose for photos

829
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:36,957
Pakya

830
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,826
What's this number scam?

831
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,868
Each couple in a mass
wedding has a number

832
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:46,565
I will have '201 ' on me,
and so will my wife

833
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,075
If not, wives can get
switched around

834
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,076
Is that so?
- Yes

835
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:52,172
So you'll wear a number
and get married?

836
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:52,782
Yes

837
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,716
Man, you're our Crown Prince

838
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,140
Don't do it

839
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,884
Then Tatiya will be in the
Union Cabinet

840
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:03,923
I won't wear a number
around my neck

841
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,596
You will wear a number

842
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,162
You will marry the way I want

843
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:11,291
My friends will laugh at me

844
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,096
They'll mock me -
'Didn't get a Ferrari...

845
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:16,761
but wore a number plate
at his wedding'

846
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,600
I won't...

847
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,871
Forget this wedding. Cancel it

848
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,170
Cancel it, I don't care

849
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,143
I won't get married your way

850
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:26,306
But we've started
the turmeric ceremony

851
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,774
How can we cancel now?

852
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,645
Babbu didi, do something

853
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,980
Yes, just a moment, excuse me

854
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,145
Son, listen to me

855
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,020
You want to sit in the Ferrari,
take photos with your pals?

856
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,753
I'll make it happen for you.
Trust me

857
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,726
One moment, excuse me

858
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,961
Can I suggest a win-win
compromise, sir?

859
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,192
There's a ceremony
at the bride's house today

860
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,769
Let's go there in style

861
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,639
The boys can have
their fill of the Ferrari

862
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,741
They'll celebrate,
get their photos taken

863
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,673
In return, tomorrow...

864
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:57,111
Pakya will wear No. 201
and get married

865
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,745
What do you say?

866
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,716
Well?

867
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,079
Well, son?

868
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,743
One moment

869
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,885
They're kids

870
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,092
Compromise

871
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,026
Take the Ferrari or your dad
will put you on a tricycle

872
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,130
Because you're my father...

873
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,375
I'm ready to compromise

874
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,436
Hit it

875
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,391
Shambhu

876
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,920
Lazy bones... Watching TV?

877
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:49,089
Where's Shambhu?

878
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,424
Shambhu hasn't come in

879
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,731
He hasn't?
- Nope

880
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,836
So who took the car keys
from me today?

881
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,166
Shambhu has the day off

882
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,355
What's the matter, Mohan?

883
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,964
The car's been stolen

884
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,805
How can that be?

885
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,936
I saw the car leave today

886
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:33,932
I opened the gate for it

887
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,476
You mean...

888
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,241
you let the thief go?

889
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,182
Don't try to trick me, Mohan

890
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,918
No one steals in broad daylight

891
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,984
The thief took the car
from under your nose

892
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:47,957
What were you doing?

893
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:49,049
Watching the match,
eating bananas

894
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,217
Big oaf

895
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:54,228
When a car enters the gate,
it's my responsibility

896
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:55,990
I ask...

897
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,199
Where do you want to go?
Whom do you want?

898
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,903
When a car leaves,
it's not my responsibility

899
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,470
I can't ask...

900
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,968
Where are you going?
Why are you going there?

901
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:09,302
I'll get beaten up

902
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:10,837
Spare me the details

903
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,311
Explain this to the
Residents' Committee

904
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,544
Not the Committee, please

905
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:16,146
Because of you, the car's gone

906
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:19,949
This is now a police matter
- No police, please

907
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,382
I'll lose my status in the village

908
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,487
You'll lose your status
in the village?

909
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,992
So confess that
you aided the theft

910
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,323
But you gave the thief the key

911
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:34,025
How did the car key
leave the house?

912
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:37,200
You were alone at home

913
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,071
Boss and his wife are
out of town

914
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,275
The cops will catch you first

915
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,574
Let me explain this to the
Residents' Committee

916
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,308
Wait, please. Don't...

917
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:51,851
Don't make a big deal
out of it, man

918
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:52,817
Listen...

919
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,483
Only you and I know
the car's been stolen

920
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,559
Does anyone else know?
- No

921
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:00,519
We can't go to the cops
or tell anyone about it

922
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:01,462
Got it?

923
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:03,498
If we stick together,
we're safe

924
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,059
If not, we're both sunk.
Got it?

925
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,531
Come, let's look for the car now

926
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:10,871
But Mohan, where do we look?

927
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,875
It's a red Ferrari -
hard to miss

928
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,142
It's here

929
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,108
The Ferrari's here

930
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,033
Babbu didi, I've a task for you

931
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,368
Turn the Ferrari into
a florist's delight

932
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:50,573
Sir?

933
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,948
Put so many flowers on it...

934
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:56,008
that one wouldn't know
if it's a Ferrari or...

935
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,480
a bullock cart

936
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:11,395
My Ferrari

937
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,472
Sir, not so close to the car

938
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,170
Sir, you'll scratch the car

939
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:22,939
Give me the Ferrari key
- Sir, where is Babbu didi?

940
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,305
Give me the car key

941
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,004
I'm sorry sir,
I can't give you the key

942
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,508
I will drive the car, sir

943
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,380
Sir

944
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,279
Sir, stay back

945
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,316
Sir, please step back

946
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:32,410
Babbu didi

947
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:33,650
What chaos

948
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:34,914
Ma'am

949
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,658
Please don't tell anyone
this is Sachin's car

950
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:37,393
Ok

951
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:38,655
And only I will drive this car

952
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:41,494
And ma'am, I have to return
the car in a few hours

953
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:43,656
Don't worry. You handle it all

954
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,991
Here, put these flowers
on the car

955
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,133
Ferrari

956
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,198
The Ferrarri key?
- Later

957
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,598
First clear the area

958
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,645
Your boss played
superbly yesterday

959
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,244
As I was saying,
Shamshu bhai...

960
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,448
I have a small problem.
I need your help

961
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,518
Anytime. I'm here to help

962
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:07,319
But you didn't keep your word

963
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,514
You'd promised me a photo
with your boss...

964
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,320
I'll get Boss here

965
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,586
You can pose with him
against any car

966
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:15,628
Seriously?

967
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,223
Sachin Tendulkar
will come here?

968
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,061
Of course. If I tell him that
Shamshu bhai, the garage owner...

969
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,135
is a big fan of his,
he won't refuse

970
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:26,670
Mohan, you've made my day.
Come on in

971
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,512
This is my friend, Mahavir Tambe

972
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,146
Pleased to meet you

973
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:35,446
He heads a huge
security guard force

974
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:37,383
We're here because...

975
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,585
his car's been stolen

976
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:43,653
A car stolen from the
Head of Security?

977
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,752
Bad days...

978
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:46,652
Easy, now

979
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,723
What car was it?

980
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,155
Alto
- Scorpio

981
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,694
Alto or Scorpio?

982
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,662
Business as usual, don't worry

983
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:56,763
Mohan

984
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,335
Both

985
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,538
Both?

986
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,405
Both

987
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,269
You see...

988
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,174
we were driving along
in the Alto

989
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:06,403
It stalled

990
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,584
To tow it, we called
for a Scorpio

991
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:12,243
Actually, we were in the
Scorpio, the Alto came...

992
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,417
You're explaining?

993
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:16,315
No, you go ahead

994
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:19,587
So, the Alto stalled

995
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:22,360
We got the Scorpio to tow it

996
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,299
As we were towing it,
he wanted to go

997
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:27,558
Go?
- Nature's call

998
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,103
We went to the side of the road

999
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,068
The thief sat in the Scorpio

1000
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:35,343
He left in the Scorpio,
dragging the Alto with it

1001
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,576
Steal one, get one free

1002
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,183
I want to know,
Shamshu bhai...

1003
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,283
The Alto, Scorpio and
other stolen cars...

1004
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,615
Where do they go?

1005
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:53,351
Scorpios go to
Bihar, U.P. Or Nepal

1006
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:56,231
And the Alto?
- The Alto...

1007
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:59,063
Forget the Alto, Shamshu bhai

1008
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:00,729
Mr. Tambe can afford
many such cars

1009
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,231
Yes, I can

1010
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:04,528
May I speak now?

1011
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:09,203
I'm just curious...
Can I ask you a question?

1012
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:10,242
Ask away

1013
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,480
When a big car is stolen...

1014
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:14,682
say a BMW or a Ferrari...

1015
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,449
what happens to it?

1016
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:19,748
Tea

1017
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,595
I don't tell anyone this

1018
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:31,589
But I'll tell you

1019
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,834
These big cars...

1020
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,167
can't be sold openly

1021
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:40,667
Right

1022
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:43,204
So what we do is this...

1023
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:46,538
We dismantle them
and sell them

1024
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:47,844
Boss

1025
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,648
Mohan, that's Boss

1026
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,185
Dismantle them?

1027
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,150
Yes

1028
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:56,382
At Sion village or Worli village

1029
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:59,594
There the car is taken apart

1030
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,794
So this is the...

1031
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,824
Tire

1032
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:08,899
Goes to Opera House

1033
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:15,332
What did you rip?

1034
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,545
Rexin

1035
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,577
Goes to Mahalakshmi

1036
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:23,812
The seat

1037
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:26,315
Goes to Mohammad Ali Road

1038
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,685
And the steering wheel
comes to me

1039
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:31,554
Right, the steering wheel

1040
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:33,686
Now what's left?

1041
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,495
The body
- Right, the body

1042
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,496
The body can't be sold

1043
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,566
So we take it...

1044
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,271
and put it into a furnace

1045
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,679
It melts into a...

1046
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:54,406
ball

1047
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:57,843
Have one
- No, thank you

1048
01:05:58,387 --> 01:05:59,354
Mr. Tambe?

1049
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,393
What's that?

1050
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:14,797
S class

1051
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:17,263
Mercedes

1052
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,899
My man stands proud
and commanding

1053
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,897
Gave his word
and got me a Ferrari

1054

Let me go phease

1094
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:27,854
Have to go now

1095
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:30,995
Need to go now

1096
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,001
Let me go now

1097
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,068
Don't fhirt and tease

01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,434

01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,843
I'm going now

1101
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,448
Let me go now

1102
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,880
Let me go to her

1103
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:58,985
Alright Rusy,
here's Rs. 150,000

1104
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,488
Before the Press gets here,
take the car away

1105
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,188
Thank you

1106
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,106
Mohan

1107
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:25,240
How much does a
Ferrari cost?

1108
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:27,037
I'll tell you

1109
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:29,674
If you sell that hole
you call home...

1110
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:33,018
to three people,
over three years...

1111
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,814
you still won't get a Ferrari tire

1112
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,115
Don't fib

1113
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,626
It has just two seats

1114
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,087
No seats in the back

1115
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,631
A scooter also has two seats

1116
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,731
A Ferrari also has two seats

1117
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:52,138
How much extra can
two wheels cost?

1118
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,074
4... 5000?

1119
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,108
Hello?

1120
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:02,043
Good morning, ma'am

1121
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,313
Yes ma'am. Ok ma'am

1122
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:05,911
Have a good day

1123
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:07,848
What's the matter, Mohan?

1124
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,126
That was Mrs. Tendulkar.
Boss is coming back

1125
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:12,954
I'm off to my village

1126
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:13,629
Wait

1127
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,597
Tell the cops
I committed suicide

1128
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,858
And my body is in
Shamshu's furnace

1129
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,092
Wait, calm down

1130
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,760
We have some time.
I have a plan. C'mon

1131
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:24,131
Leave me out of it

1132
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,741
Boss is back tomorrow night,
don't worry

1133
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:27,939
Come with me

1134
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,339
Mohan

1135
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:33,980
Police

1136
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:35,308
Run

1137
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:36,742
Run!

1138
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:37,919
C'mon, hurry

1139
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:39,822
Mohan, wait for me.
My helmet...

1140
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:43,019
Put it on. Use your head

1141
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,043
Mohan

1142
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,350
Mohan, I can hear
the sound of the Ferrari

1143
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:11,080
You're going mad. Run

1144
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:33,899
Rustom Behram Deboo,
Transport Office

1145
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,840
Sir, why's the police
here today?

1146
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,171
The Ganesh festival
and Sachin's century...

1147
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,076
That's when the police
works overtime

1148
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:42,945
Just a precaution
- Ok

1149
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:44,850
Not starting?

1150
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,681
Lt'll start, sir

1151
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:48,345
Listen, try this

1152
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,190
Run it down the slope
in neutral

1153
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,751
Then slip it into 2nd gear.
It'll start

1154
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:53,753
Ok...

1155
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,022
Get on the slope

1156
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,731
In neutral?
- Yes

1157
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,094
Keep it in neutral.
Now put it into 2nd gear

1158
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,393
There, it started

1159
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,309
Rustom, hold on

1160
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,103
Help me with this

1161
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,973
Got to nab this red car

1162
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,376
Yes sir...

1163
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:33,292
Hello?

1164
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,897
Rusy, where are you?
It's morning

1165
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:38,204
Where were you?

1166
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:42,133
Papa, something terrible
has happened

1167
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:45,040
What... You had an accident?

1168
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:49,751
Papa, I stole Sachin's Ferrari

1169
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:54,815
You crazy?
I was fooling with you

1170
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:56,282
Where's the car?

1171
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:01,024
The car's being towed away

1172
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:04,297
Now do as I say.
Come straight home

1173
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:05,296
Wear your helmet

1174
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,834
Hide your face from the cops

1175
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,738
Something really terrible
happened, Papa

1176
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:11,035
What now?

1177
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,136
Papa, I left Rs.150,000
in the car

1178
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,108
Kayo can't go to Lord's, Papa

1179
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,079
Kayo... Lord's...

1180
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,201
Pawar, prepare that report.
I'm leaving

1181
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:47,203
C'mon Jadhav

1182
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,143
Jadhav, slow down

1183
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:53,047
Stop, I said

1184
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,547
Inspector Mhatre,
what have you brought in?

1185
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,589
It's called a car.
Has four wheels...

1186
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,917
Sir, this is no car.
It's a celestial chariot

1187
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:05,719
The chariot of my God

1188
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:08,260
It's Sachin Tendulkar's Ferrari

1189
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,495
But your God parked
in a No Parking zone

1190
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:13,499
Will my God come
to get his car, sir?

1191
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:15,602
Whether it's your God
or his driver...

1192
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:18,103
don't release the car
without taking the fine

1193
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,134
Don't worry, sir.
I'll watch over this car

1194
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,101
O Lord, thank you

1195
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,184
There's the Ferrari

1196
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,928
Looking good, Pakya

1197
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,900
But the Ferrari can't be seen

1198
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,534
Where is the Ferrari?

1199
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:50,671
Look for it

1200
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:53,936
Go to the next one

1201
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:55,668
It's covered with flowers

1202
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:57,539
Is it a Ferrari
or a humble taxi?

1203
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:01,579
Pakya, your dad's fooled you

1204
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:05,317
His dad fooled him

1205
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:06,711
How many done, Babbu didi?

1206
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,947
180 couples done, 20 to go

1207
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,124
20...

1208
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,589
You. Come here

1209
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,091
Married?
- Yes sir

1210
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:14,320
What was the hurry?

1211
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:15,922
Never mind

1212
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:17,859
Get your wife
and get re-married

1213
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,261
But sir...
- If she objects...

1214
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:21,761
tell her you're
renewing your vows

1215
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,998
She'll be thrilled.
Run, now

1216
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:25,764
That makes 181 couples

1217
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:26,941
Give me a minute

1218
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,012
What's this?
- What's what?

1219
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:31,309
What's this, Babbu didi?

1220
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:33,781
Who told you to use
so many flowers?

1221
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,576
Who does that to a Ferrari?

1222
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:38,277
It's a wedding car -
it must have flowers

1223
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,245
You're Mr. Mandke's
son, no less

1224
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:42,680
If there were fewer flowers,
people would gossip

1225
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:43,950
They'd call us stingy

1226
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,354
They're gossiping now

1227
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,592
Saying it's not a Ferrari
under the flowers...

1228
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:48,957
it's an ordinary taxi

1229
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:50,697
People will say anything

1230
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,130
You know the truth.
You know it's a Ferrari

1231
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:56,969
Walk the path of truth, son.
It's useful in the long run

1232
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:58,629
You wronged me, Babbu didi

1233
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,333
C'mon now...

1234
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,870
You committed a fraud

1235
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:04,244
Our deal is off

1236
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:05,839
No compromise

1237
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:08,278
At my wedding tomorrow,
I want the Ferrari

1238
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,876
Without flowers on it

1239
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,185
Go on, now

1240
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,681
Told you to get an abortion

1241
01:18:16,892 --> 01:18:18,325
Look at what you produced

1242
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:19,853
What kind of talk is that?

1243
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:21,627
Mom...

1244
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:24,259
What sort of guy did you marry?

1245
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,868
If you had asked me,
I would've rejected him

1246
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,062
Be quiet

1247
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:32,963
You all go ahead

1248
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:33,733
Pakya...

1249
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,671
Don't say anything

1250
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:37,846
Leave, I said

1251
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:38,870
Going

1252
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:41,949
Babbu didi, please handle this

1253
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:49,118
The Press will not see
the Ferrari

1254
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,783
That's final

1255
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:54,056
That's my order

1256
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:58,024
Then the Press will not see...

1257
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:02,165
me wearing a number

1258
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:03,793
That's my wish

1259
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:07,409
You can't afford a wish,
you pipsqueak

1260
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,001
Dad, no...

1261
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,303
Don't mess with me, boy

1262
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:19,751
Sir, couple no. 182

1263
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,290
I'll see you at home

1264
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,355
What happened?

1265
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:31,092
Scram

1266
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,299
I've always told you...

1267
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:35,993
to stay away from cricket

1268
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,363
It's made you into a thief now

1269
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,037
The Great Gangster
of the Deboo family...

1270
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,906
Rustom Behram Deboo

1271
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:44,840
Papa, I have to
send Kayo to Lord's

1272
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,905
Why are you so dense?

1273
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,184
During recession in the
white man's land...

1274
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,084
camps like this are invented

1275
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:56,247
They look for gullible fools
like you, who fall for it

1276
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:58,324
You want to go to prison?

1277
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:02,195
In prison, hold a slate,
get your mug shots taken

1278
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,091
Make your family famous

1279
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,163
Cricket ruins you, I tell you

1280
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:12,801
There're many dirty games
behind this sport

1281
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,098
Answer this...

1282
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,470
Who knows cricket best,
you or me?

1283
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:18,444
Papa, I know...
- No, tell me...

1284
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,914
who knows cricket best,
you or me?

1285
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,181
Papa, I know some cricket too

1286
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:24,917
I played well once

1287
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,280
But you didn't let me play

1288
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,012
Well, thank me for it

1289
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,223
I saved you

1290
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:31,892
Protected you

1291
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,824
Papa, don't protect Kayo

1292
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:35,993
Let him live his life

1293
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,055
He's a gifted cricketer

1294
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,526
He'll make you proud one day

1295
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:42,359
That pint-sized rookie
a cricketer?

1296
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:45,932
He knocks a ball in a sock
in the living room

1297
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:48,041
That won't make him
a cricketer

1298
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,803
Papa, you haven't
seen his game

1299
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:51,310
He's captain of his team

1300
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:55,416
In India, millions of kids
play cricket

1301
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,212
From the city center,
if you hurl a pebble...

1302
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:01,322
it'll land on a captain's head

1303
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:03,082
Rusy

1304
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:04,849
Remember this...

1305
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:08,254
In a cricket team,
there are only eleven players

1306
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,396
What of those who don't
make it to the team?

1307
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,059
I'll tell you

1308
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,893
They sit on a sofa,
stare at the TV...

1309
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:18,472
use a remote control,
and tuck into peanuts

1310
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:23,406
You may as well put a
Kayo-sized sofa next to mine

1311
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:27,181
Why are you destroying his life?

1312
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:29,146
I'm not destroying his life

1313
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,384
I'm helping him make it

1314
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:33,577
You think he'll ever make it
to the top eleven?

1315
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:38,585
No Papa

1316
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:42,324
He's way ahead of the top eleven

1317
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,294
No one is even close to him

1318
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:48,060
Not even you

1319
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,435
Know who you're talking to?

1320
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:54,339
You're talking to
Behram Ardeshir Deboo

1321
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,172
You know who you're talking to?

1322
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,059
Papa, you were the bestest?

1323
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,056
Bowl as many balls as you want

1324
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:16,623
Just...

1325
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:19,930
try and get him out

1326
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:29,439
Kayo

1327
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:32,072
Papa

1328
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:34,245
Want to play a match?

1329
01:22:34,516 --> 01:22:35,312
A match?

1330
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:36,980
Now?

1331
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,111
With whom?

1332
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,359
Papa?

1333
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:15,864
He's asleep?

1334
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,332
Yes Papa

1335
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:27,841
Today's the selection?

1336
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,114
Yes Papa

1337
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:34,845
You take Kayo for it

1338
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:40,552
I'll get the money

1339
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:52,865
Where will you get
the money from?

1340
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:55,540
An old friend

1341
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,145
He owes me one

1342
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:04,549
I'll call you when
I get the money

1343
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,457
You just get Kayo to the ground

1344
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:16,252
You're looking good

1345
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,416
Rusy
- Yes Papa?

1346
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:44,917
Give Kayo this tip

1347
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:46,486
Yes?

1348
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:48,555
When...

1349
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:51,955
a bowler bowls...

1350
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:57,831
Go on, Papa.
When a bowler bowls...

1351
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,571
No, let him play
the way he does

1352
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,377
He'll knock them off their feet

1353
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:32,863
Everyone ready?
- Yes sir

1354
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:35,638
Let's go.
Batsman to my right

1355
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:37,468
Bowlers to my left

1356
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,029
I want to meet
Dilip Dharmadhikari

1357
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:07,599
Well?

1358
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:11,638
From my club, at least
one boy should go to Lord's

1359
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:13,772
You want your son to go?

1360
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,948
He really wants to go

1361
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:18,410
Do something

1362
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,988
You do something
about those TV rights

1363
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:22,478
Consider it done

1364
01:29:22,724 --> 01:29:24,521
Then consider this done, too

1365
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:28,056
Gattu Godbole,
his name. RC Club

1366
01:29:28,596 --> 01:29:30,359
Gattu Godbole. Ok

1367
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,468
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Deboo's here to meet you

1368
01:29:34,902 --> 01:29:36,836
Who Deboo?
- Behram Deboo

1369
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:41,901
6thh f eoor

1370
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:50,651
Deboo

1371
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:00,461
After so many years

1372
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,019
Please sit down

1373
01:30:03,464 --> 01:30:05,830
You've put on some weight

1374
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:08,830
What will you have?
Tea? Coffee?

1375
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,463
Beer?

1376
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,601
One coffee, please

1377
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,944
How many years
has it been, Deboo?

1378
01:30:16,944 --> 01:30:18,036
38 years

1379
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:21,779
How time flies

1380
01:30:24,652 --> 01:30:26,711
So, to what do I
owe this honor?

1381
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:31,017
38 years back...

1382
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,724
I had a friend

1383
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:38,730
We did everything together...

1384
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,731
shared all secrets...

1385
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:46,699
checked out pretty girls together

1386
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:53,380
We made thousands of runs
together in record partnerships

1387
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:56,615
Those were the days

1388
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:01,418
Dilip

1389
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:11,026
What you did to me...

1390
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:14,969
After 38 years, you're here
to make me feel guilty?

1391
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:16,561
No
- Is that so?

1392
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,565
Not at all

1393
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:22,606
That's not so

1394
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:25,512
I'm ready to forget and forgive

1395
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:29,411
If I do that...

1396
01:31:30,184 --> 01:31:31,986
then you're my only friend

1397
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:32,543
Yes

1398
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:34,948
You are my friend, yes?
- Of course

1399
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:37,825
Well?

1400
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:39,050
Dilip

1401
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:41,585
I have a grandson

1402
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,899
Deboo, you're a grandfather?

1403
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:47,991
I don't look old enough, I know

1404
01:31:49,904 --> 01:31:51,166
He's a cricketer

1405
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,073
Of course he is

1406
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:58,807
You know that
cricket camp at Lord's?

1407
01:31:59,747 --> 01:32:01,942
He wants to go for that

1408
01:32:04,785 --> 01:32:07,515
Well, you see, I must tell you...

1409
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:09,655
the selection is based on merit

1410
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:11,859
And in this position,
I can't favor anyone

1411
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:12,791
Hold it, Dilip

1412
01:32:12,994 --> 01:32:15,485
I'm not asking you
to do anything wrong

1413
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,554
I'm just clarifying

1414
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:18,792
I understand your position

1415
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:21,493
He's so good,
he will be selected

1416
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:26,972
The problem is the Rs. 150,000
to be paid after that

1417
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:30,942
It's 150,000 yes

1418
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:33,805
So I thought of some options

1419
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:37,709
Can you ask the Board...

1420
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:41,919
for a grant or scholarship?

1421
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,020
No, it will not work out

1422
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,694
If we do it for one,
we'll have to do it for others

1423
01:32:47,828 --> 01:32:49,557
And if the Press gets wind of it...

1424
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:50,561
I know

1425
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:53,495
In this position, actually,
my hands are tied

1426
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:55,131
I understand

1427
01:32:55,803 --> 01:32:56,861
What now...

1428
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:04,241
There's another option

1429
01:33:08,516 --> 01:33:10,108
As my friend...

1430
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:15,585
can't you loan me Rs. 150,000?

1431
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:24,893
Yeah?

1432
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,198
One moment

1433
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:32,898
I'll just be back

1434
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:55,662
Kayoze - Net no. 2

1435
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:09,201
Every gaze is fixed on you

1436
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:14,008
Each heart harbors new hope

1437
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,118
The crowds support you

1438
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:24,190
The crowds support you

1439
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:26,027
So do what champions do

1440
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:30,794
With a mighty bat.
Make a hefty score

1441
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:33,831
More...

1442
01:34:34,201 --> 01:34:35,225
He hits

1443
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:36,760
Up and away

1444
01:34:37,304 --> 01:34:38,965
In the air

1445
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:40,665
A big hit

1446
01:34:55,156 --> 01:34:56,123
Thank you

1447
01:35:00,294 --> 01:35:01,921
Sir, he won't be back

1448
01:35:02,663 --> 01:35:03,288
Why?

1449
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:05,028
I speak from experience

1450
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:11,735
Sir

1451
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:15,103
I'm a big fan

1452
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:17,400
You took eight wickets...

1453
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:19,846
on the dead pitch
of the Matunga Club

1454
01:35:21,015 --> 01:35:22,004
I still remember that clearly

1455
01:35:23,084 --> 01:35:28,112
Sir, an autograph please

1456
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:37,997
Hello Papa? Any luck?

1457
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:43,000
Lt'll work out, don't worry

1458
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,866
How's our boy playing?

1459
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:51,844
He's knocking them
off their feet

1460
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:55,972
Papa, you went to meet
Dilip Dharmadhikari?

1461
01:35:58,686 --> 01:35:59,948
It didn't work out, did it, Papa?

1462
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:04,224
It's ok Papa, we'll find a way

1463
01:36:05,192 --> 01:36:07,353
lt'll work out, Papa.
Don't worry

1464
01:36:07,828 --> 01:36:09,921
Later... I'll call you later

1465
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:16,325
Well played, Kayo

1466
01:36:18,339 --> 01:36:19,806
Nice

1467
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:22,903
Sir, I have to leave
on some urgent work

1468
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:25,169
Would you please
drop Kayo home?

1469
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:26,743
Sure, no problem

1470
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:30,074
Shot

1471
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,013
Don't worry, I'll drop him

1472
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:37,754
Get away from the car

1473
01:36:38,092 --> 01:36:39,491
Don't touch the car

1474
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:41,461
Don't touch the hood

1475
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:43,454
Everyone move back

1476
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:48,267
Stop taking pictures

1477
01:36:52,506 --> 01:36:53,495
Who are you?

1478
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:55,466
Rustom Behram Deboo,
Transport Office

1479
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:58,271
So help me out here.
Move everyone away

1480
01:36:58,779 --> 01:37:00,178
Sir, I have an idea

1481
01:37:00,447 --> 01:37:01,379
There's Sachin

1482
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:02,406
Where?

1483
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:03,313
There

1484
01:37:06,053 --> 01:37:07,520
Sir, where are you off to?

1485
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:08,886
To Sachin...

1486
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:10,013
Sir, that was just to distract them

1487
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:12,056
Before they're back,
put barricades here

1488
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:15,024
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I have another idea

1489
01:37:15,296 --> 01:37:16,320
Thank you

1490
01:37:21,268 --> 01:37:22,394
Sir

1491
01:37:22,970 --> 01:37:24,369
Excuse me, sir

1492
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:26,973
Sir, your scooter key

1493
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:29,005
Thank you
- Mention not

1494
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:33,402
Good news, old chap

1495
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:36,006
No Ferrari has come
here for gas

1496
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,152
In Mumbai, there are only
five gas stations...

1497
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:39,414
that stock gas for the Ferrari

1498
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,321
We've checked all five

1499
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:42,847
This means...

1500
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:46,992
the thief has gas for only 50 km

1501
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:49,819
But 50 km in which direction?

1502
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:52,362
The car may have gone
50 km this way...

1503
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:55,232
while we go 50 km that way

1504
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,561
That makes 100 km

1505
01:37:58,038 --> 01:38:01,064
Your brain measures
1 centimeter

1506
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:03,436
Don't put a 100 km load on it

1507
01:38:03,577 --> 01:38:05,545
C'mon, start your Ferrari

1508
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,380
My brain's not working

1509
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:09,438
Give me the helmet

1510
01:38:10,284 --> 01:38:13,515
That scooter key looked like
the Ferrari key to me

1511
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,548
Don't remind me of the key.
C'mon, hurry

1512
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:18,388
And how much for this?

1513
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:21,325
5000... 3000... 2000...

1514
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:23,587
1500... 1500... 1500...

1515
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:24,827
Rs. 1500...

1516
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:27,000
What model, what size?

1517
01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:28,325
Tell me, Your Royal Highness?

1518
01:38:28,869 --> 01:38:31,337
Size... It's big

1519
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,164
Is it a truck?

1520
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:35,399
You need a large banner

1521
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:37,502
Sorry

1522
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:39,972
Excuse me

1523
01:38:40,447 --> 01:38:42,210
Sir

1524
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,379
A banner

1525
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,285
Banner?

1526
01:38:44,285 --> 01:38:45,274
Why a banner?

1527
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:12,938
Lower it carefully

1528
01:39:13,314 --> 01:39:15,214
That's great

1529
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:19,647
No one will touch it now

1530
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:40,038
Clear off now

1531
01:39:40,607 --> 01:39:42,905
Sir, one moment

1532
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:45,472
BCA?

1533
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:47,278
Bombay Cricket Association?

1534
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:49,606
Sir, I was once President

1535
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:50,507
Of BCA?

1536
01:39:50,684 --> 01:39:52,379
No... Our BCA is...

1537
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:53,645
Borivli Cricket Association

1538
01:39:54,054 --> 01:39:56,022
A cricket club for our constables

1539
01:39:56,223 --> 01:39:59,215
Sir, I'm famous for my
quarter centuries

1540
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:02,993
Sir, you're here for
Sachin Tendulkar's car?

1541
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:09,462
Who's the senior officer here?

1542
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,161
Who brought Sachin's car here?

1543
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,940
It wasn't me.
It was Inspector Mhatre

1544
01:40:14,975 --> 01:40:17,136
Get Inspector Mhatre

1545
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:18,712
Get Mhatre here

1546
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:20,680
Sir, Inspector Mhatre
plays football

1547
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:23,006
He knows nothing of cricket

1548
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:24,582
This is Sachin's car

1549
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:26,112
He didn't know that

1550
01:40:26,253 --> 01:40:28,278
The car was in a
No Parking zone, so...

1551
01:40:28,555 --> 01:40:32,992
Yes, but how will I know if
the car's with cops or thieves?

1552
01:40:33,227 --> 01:40:34,319
It's like this, sir...

1553
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:36,053
When we confiscate a car...

1554
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:37,456
we make a chalk circle there

1555
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:41,225
In it we write the name of
the police station the car is at

1556
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,063
If you make a chalk mark...

1557
01:40:43,303 --> 01:40:45,430
and thousands walk over it...

1558
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:47,234
won't it get erased?

1559
01:40:48,008 --> 01:40:51,311
Yes... But sir,
we have to follow orders

1560
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:52,710
Who's the senior officer here?

1561
01:40:54,014 --> 01:40:55,072
Who's your senior?

1562
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:56,204
I'm the senior-most, sir

1563
01:40:56,316 --> 01:40:58,011
But don't scold me sir, please

1564
01:40:58,218 --> 01:40:59,082
Did I scold you?

1565
01:40:59,486 --> 01:41:00,282
Did I get angry?

1566
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:02,179
Did I raise my voice?
- No

1567
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:03,689
Who dares to say
I scolded you?

1568
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,993
I want to meet
your senior officer

1569
01:41:05,993 --> 01:41:07,984
Sir, take the car

1570
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:11,061
Yes, take the car

1571
01:41:11,298 --> 01:41:13,061
I'll handle Inspector Mhatre

1572
01:41:13,267 --> 01:41:14,359
No fine, nothing

1573
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:16,298
You must take the fine
- No sir

1574
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:17,630
Sachin will scold me

1575
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:20,039
Please sir,
I don't want anything

1576
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:20,638
Ok

1577
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:23,402
But how do I take the car...

1578
01:41:23,544 --> 01:41:25,375
Sir, I'll get you a tow truck

1579
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,570
lt'll drop you where you want

1580
01:41:27,781 --> 01:41:30,215
Free of charge
- Totally free

1581
01:41:31,085 --> 01:41:32,780
Gautiya... Ashok...

1582
01:41:36,056 --> 01:41:36,522
Hello?

1583
01:41:36,623 --> 01:41:38,215
Hello Papa, this is Kayo

1584
01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:39,286
Yes son?

1585
01:41:39,493 --> 01:41:40,790
Papa, I got selected

1586
01:41:41,395 --> 01:41:42,657
I'm so proud of you, son

1587
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,223
Kayo, listen - I got the money

1588
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:46,330
Got the money?

1589
01:41:47,267 --> 01:41:47,596
Sir

1590
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:48,759
One moment, sir

1591
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:50,262
Papa, hold on

1592
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:52,732
Sir, it's Papa.
He got the money

1593
01:41:53,674 --> 01:41:54,698
Rusy, congratulations

1594
01:41:55,175 --> 01:41:56,802
Today, both father and son
are victorious

1595
01:41:57,578 --> 01:41:58,306
Thank you, sir

1596
01:41:58,712 --> 01:41:59,474
Kayo sounds...

1597
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:02,413
He's jumping with joy

1598
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:07,117
Sir, I'll see you tomorrow
morning then

1599
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:08,481
Ok. Here, talk to him

1600
01:42:10,691 --> 01:42:12,420
Kayo listen
- Yes Papa?

1601
01:42:12,593 --> 01:42:14,288
I'll call you later

1602
01:42:14,595 --> 01:42:17,723
I'll call you.
I love you. Bye

1603
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:20,533
Gautiya, let's go
- Gautiya, drive safe

1604
01:42:20,667 --> 01:42:22,259
Thank you, sir

1605
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:06,108
What's wrong with Pakya?

1606
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:13,180
Dad's here.
Give me the number plate

1607
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:20,223
Whoever wants to take
a picture, take it now

1608
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:24,224
Tomorrow's newspaper
should print this headline...

1609
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:27,594
Politician's son commits suicide'

1610
01:43:28,168 --> 01:43:30,534
Pakya, what are you doing?

1611
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:31,705
Get down

1612
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:33,434
Yes, come down

1613
01:43:35,242 --> 01:43:37,142
At the wedding today,
I want the Ferrari

1614
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:39,409
If the Ferrari is there...

1615
01:43:39,713 --> 01:43:41,203
I'll be there

1616
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:43,176
If not, I'll go up there...

1617
01:43:43,317 --> 01:43:45,512
your vote bank
will go down there

1618
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:47,379
Why are you doing this?

1619
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:49,485
Get down. Come home

1620
01:43:49,623 --> 01:43:51,147
Mom, stop talking

1621
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:53,250
You're talking too much

1622
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:56,760
The People's Representative
is not talking at all

1623
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,220
Lokre

1624
01:43:58,565 --> 01:44:00,760
Speak, o Savior of the Masses

1625
01:44:01,335 --> 01:44:03,326
You're so brave, aren't you?

1626
01:44:03,503 --> 01:44:05,528
Ok, go ahead and jump

1627
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:08,333
Jump or I'll shoot you, Pakya

1628
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:09,871
Dad's going to shoot me, man

1629
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,400
Don't be afraid, Pakya

1630
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:13,236
1...

1631
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:14,846
2...

1632
01:44:14,881 --> 01:44:16,678
Don't move, Pakya.
He won't shoot

1633
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:18,281
3...

1634
01:44:22,589 --> 01:44:24,420
Melodramatic clown

1635
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:27,552
Holding his father to ransom

1636
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:29,590
What does he think he's doing?

1637
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,295
Just get him the Ferrari

1638
01:44:31,531 --> 01:44:32,589
You think it's candy?

1639
01:44:33,233 --> 01:44:34,723
My dad wants to be famous

1640
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:36,896
Now watch

1641
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:40,866
In front of the Press,
I'll arrive in a Ferrari

1642
01:44:42,509 --> 01:44:43,567
Kayo

1643
01:44:44,344 --> 01:44:45,311
Papa

1644
01:44:45,379 --> 01:44:46,311
Hi son

1645
01:44:46,446 --> 01:44:47,913
See this - the money

1646
01:44:48,248 --> 01:44:48,680
The money?

1647
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:50,339
I'm going to Lord's?
- Yes

1648
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:51,950
My Papa's the bestest

1649
01:45:11,338 --> 01:45:14,466
I feel one boy from every club
should go to Lord's

1650
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:17,435
It keeps everyone motivated

1651
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:20,972
Ajay, has any club been left out?

1652
01:45:23,617 --> 01:45:26,313
Yes sir. JD club,
MBM club, RC club...

1653
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:28,886
RC Club... I believe
it's a very good club

1654
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:31,723
We should have a boy from there

1655
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:32,856
Who's the President?

1656
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:33,983
Mr. Godbole

1657
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:34,884
Godbole...

1658
01:45:35,462 --> 01:45:36,656
Call up Godbole

1659
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:38,798
Ask him to recommend a player

1660
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:40,023
Sir

1661
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:43,561
Sir, on the board is a shortlist
of our 16 best players

1662
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:45,661
Yes, but some of these
will back out

1663
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,839
That first name, for instance

1664
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:50,009
Unfortunately, he doesn't
have the money

1665
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:51,775
No sir, he has no such problem

1666
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:53,846
His grandfather came to me...

1667
01:45:53,947 --> 01:45:55,312
for a fee waiver

1668
01:45:55,515 --> 01:45:56,982
He's automatically out

1669
01:45:57,484 --> 01:45:58,041
Teja

1670
01:46:02,622 --> 01:46:03,452
Hello?

1671
01:46:03,824 --> 01:46:04,654
It's Vilayat

1672
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:05,722
Yes sir?

1673
01:46:05,892 --> 01:46:07,917
Rusy, you've got the money?

1674
01:46:08,662 --> 01:46:09,321
Yes sir

1675
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:10,757
I've got the money.
I told you

1676
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:12,299
But he's saying you
don't have the money

1677
01:46:12,299 --> 01:46:13,823
Wants to cancel
Kayo's selection

1678
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,991
Who, sir?
Who's saying this?

1679
01:46:16,536 --> 01:46:17,400
Dharmadhikari

1680
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:20,429
I see now. It's a
misunderstanding

1681
01:46:20,674 --> 01:46:21,572
I have the money, sir

1682
01:46:22,342 --> 01:46:23,331
Can you...

1683
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,442
come to the club now?

1684
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:26,607
Right away. It's important

1685
01:46:27,013 --> 01:46:29,481
Sir, I'll see you there then

1686
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:31,048
Bring the money
- Ok

1687
01:46:38,492 --> 01:46:39,390
Rusy

1688
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,360
Now turn around

1689
01:46:42,763 --> 01:46:43,855
Go on

1690
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:48,663
Hurry up

1691
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:57,036
Wait here till I get back, ok?

1692
01:46:57,644 --> 01:46:59,009
All the boys been signed up?

1693
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:00,710
Let's fly to London

1694
01:47:00,947 --> 01:47:03,006
And wish you all a great,
happy new year

1695
01:47:03,383 --> 01:47:04,975
Happy new year, sir

1696
01:47:05,385 --> 01:47:06,909
Good evening. Gentlemen,
sorry to come in like this

1697
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:08,884
This is my son, Kayoze Deboo.
Actually, Vilayat...

1698
01:47:09,389 --> 01:47:09,787
Hello sir

1699
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:12,392
Vilayat called me.
I'm here to tell you that...

1700
01:47:12,392 --> 01:47:13,860
I have Rs. 150,000
- One moment

1701
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:14,849
What's this?

1702
01:47:15,462 --> 01:47:16,588
How did you get in?

1703
01:47:17,697 --> 01:47:19,028
The selection is over

1704
01:47:19,366 --> 01:47:21,630
I don't even know
if this boy plays well

1705
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:23,736
He's better than you ever were

1706
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,066
Bowl to him once

1707
01:47:27,641 --> 01:47:28,801
He'll smash you

1708
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:31,372
Deboo. You're back?

1709
01:47:32,145 --> 01:47:33,043
Tell everyone here...

1710
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:36,408
Didn't you say you
don't have the money?

1711
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:39,385
Rusy
- Yes Papa?

1712
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:41,678
Give me the car key,
I'll get the money

1713
01:47:41,955 --> 01:47:43,013
Papa, I have the money

1714
01:47:43,056 --> 01:47:45,047
Car key, Rusy,
don't argue

1715
01:47:45,158 --> 01:47:47,490
Papa, the money...
- The key, Rusy

1716
01:47:47,561 --> 01:47:48,994
I've brought the money

1717
01:47:55,769 --> 01:47:56,861
You also brought money?

1718
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,665
Yes
- Amazing

1719
01:47:59,105 --> 01:48:00,072
Here, Dilip

1720
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:04,599
Tell me if you want more

1721
01:48:05,111 --> 01:48:07,102
I have another 150,000 rupees

1722
01:48:07,447 --> 01:48:09,881
Take next year's fee,
if you want

1723
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:11,540
Did you count it?
- Yes. It's 150,000

1724
01:48:11,718 --> 01:48:13,083
All good?
- Yes

1725
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:14,850
Well?

1726
01:48:16,022 --> 01:48:18,684
My decision is final

1727
01:48:18,925 --> 01:48:20,688
The selection is over

1728
01:48:21,928 --> 01:48:23,919
You son-of-a...
- Wait Papa...

1729
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:25,859
Papa, one moment

1730
01:48:26,066 --> 01:48:27,192
Papa, please

1731
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:38,738
For 38 years, Papa has
battled you in his dreams

1732
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:40,137
He's hit you

1733
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:45,145
But he never realized
he was hurting himself...

1734
01:48:46,152 --> 01:48:48,143
while you were untouched

1735
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:54,492
But today if you play dirty...

1736
01:48:55,128 --> 01:48:57,653
I'll forget you were
once Papa's friend

1737
01:49:00,634 --> 01:49:02,795
You'll get clobbered,
Mr. Dharmadhikari

1738
01:49:03,603 --> 01:49:04,934
Seriously clobbered

1739
01:49:07,574 --> 01:49:09,007
Mr. Dharmadhikari

1740
01:49:09,809 --> 01:49:11,868
This boy was selected on merit

1741
01:49:12,913 --> 01:49:14,904
If he doesn't go to London...

1742
01:49:15,181 --> 01:49:18,048
all committee members will resign

1743
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:39,164
You're going to London?

1744
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:42,039
Take thermal underwear
so you don't freeze

1745
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:44,540
Papa, can I go to the fountain?

1746
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:45,272
Yes, go

1747
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:51,046
Quickly tell me...

1748
01:49:52,285 --> 01:49:54,185
Where did you get
the money from?

1749
01:49:55,088 --> 01:49:56,180
I took it out of the Ferrari

1750
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:57,614
The Ferrari?

1751
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:00,959
I went to the police station,
covered the car, got in

1752
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:03,085
I got in, but it was a
tense situation

1753
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:05,862
The cops started towing
the car to Sachin's house

1754
01:50:06,066 --> 01:50:07,192
With me inside

1755
01:50:07,634 --> 01:50:10,125
I managed to slip out
with the money

1756
01:50:11,805 --> 01:50:13,238
Where did you get
the money from?

1757
01:50:13,740 --> 01:50:16,140
Give me a moment
- You must tell me

1758
01:50:16,309 --> 01:50:17,310
Tell me, Papa

1759
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:20,802
Hold on. Give me a moment

1760
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:22,642
Papa, tell me how
you got the money

1761
01:50:22,849 --> 01:50:25,818
I brought the car here

1762
01:50:25,986 --> 01:50:27,613
What car? The Ferrari?

1763
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:35,288
9999

1764
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:38,855
Papa, this is Sachin's car

1765
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:40,692
What is it doing here?

1766
01:50:42,202 --> 01:50:44,261
Gautiya dumped the car
and scooted

1767
01:50:44,738 --> 01:50:46,603
Give me the key, Rusy

1768
01:50:47,207 --> 01:50:48,765
We need to leave fast

1769
01:50:48,942 --> 01:50:49,909
Let's disappear

1770
01:50:50,176 --> 01:50:51,234
Yes, little one

1771
01:50:51,811 --> 01:50:52,743
You see...

1772
01:50:52,946 --> 01:50:55,744
the car came to your papa
for official work

1773
01:50:55,949 --> 01:50:57,974
I told your papa to get
the car home...

1774
01:50:58,118 --> 01:50:58,982
but your papa refused

1775
01:50:59,085 --> 01:51:00,754
So I called up Sachin

1776
01:51:00,754 --> 01:51:04,588
Sachin said - Please take it,
take the car

1777
01:51:04,724 --> 01:51:06,749
I'll top off the tank
and send it to you

1778
01:51:06,926 --> 01:51:09,087
I said there's a young
Sachin in my home

1779
01:51:09,262 --> 01:51:10,786
1... 2... 3...

1780
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:12,627
What do we see...

1781
01:51:13,133 --> 01:51:16,068
Let's go drive all night.
Right, Rusy?

1782
01:51:16,269 --> 01:51:17,201
Come, sit

1783
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:19,966
C'mon, enter your kingdom.
Very nice

1784
01:51:20,306 --> 01:51:22,900
Papa, we have to drop
the car off at Sachin's

1785
01:51:23,309 --> 01:51:27,006
Yes, I know.
We'll fly it there, you'll see

1786
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:29,611
Hurry Rusy

1787
01:51:31,818 --> 01:51:32,682
Grandpa

1788
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:37,822
Thank you

1789
01:51:48,168 --> 01:51:48,896
Grandpa

1790
01:51:49,335 --> 01:51:51,735
Does Sachin sit on this seat?

1791
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:55,097
Since it's his car,
this is the seat he sits on

1792
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:57,104
No seats behind, anyway

1793
01:51:59,112 --> 01:52:01,376
And this is the
steering wheel he holds?

1794
01:52:01,848 --> 01:52:05,306
When he drives, he has to
hold this steering wheel

1795
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:08,644
You want to touch it?

1796
01:52:09,756 --> 01:52:11,189
Yes
- Go ahead

1797
01:52:11,891 --> 01:52:13,256
Such small fingers you have

1798
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:15,759
1... 2... and...

1799
01:52:53,433 --> 01:52:55,765
C'mon het's take a ride

1800
01:52:58,138 --> 01:53:00,402
Spin, rohh or dip, you decide

1801
01:53:03,143 --> 01:53:05,373
It's a groovy trip ahh the way

1802
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:07,335
In a car that ain't a car...

1803
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:10,281
but a whirhwind that
whisks you away

1804
01:53:11,384 --> 01:53:12,442
Fa fa fa fa...

1805
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:13,820
Ra ra ra ri...

1806
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:16,084
Fa fa fa fa... Ferrari

1807
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:17,349
Sa sa sa sa...

1808
01:53:17,423 --> 01:53:18,825
Wa wa wa wa...

1809
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:21,453
The swashbuckhing
Ride in the Ferrari

1810
01:53:36,009 --> 01:53:38,344
Life bursts out,
bright and ghamorous

1811
01:53:38,344 --> 01:53:41,006
From drab and duhh,
to unique and marvehhous

1812
01:53:41,047 --> 01:53:44,949
We zip ahead without
a care in the worhd now

1813
01:53:45,885 --> 01:53:48,354
It's a taste of
new adventure and cheer

1814
01:53:48,354 --> 01:53:50,957
Why waste the chance
we were given here

1815
01:53:50,957 --> 01:53:54,449
Let's dart away on
winged paths now

1816
01:53:55,395 --> 01:53:58,330
The heart hohds sway,
it must have its way

1817
01:53:58,364 --> 01:54:00,832
It's a magicah night today

1818
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:01,992
Fa fa fa fa...

1819
01:54:02,168 --> 01:54:03,226
Ra ra ra ri...

1820
01:54:03,403 --> 01:54:05,769
Fa fa fa fa... Ferrari

1821
01:54:05,872 --> 01:54:06,930
Sa sa sa sa...

1822
01:54:07,073 --> 01:54:08,199
Wa wa wa wa...

1823
01:54:08,408 --> 01:54:10,808
The swashbuckhing
Ride in the Ferrari

1824
01:54:10,844 --> 01:54:13,278
It's a Ride in a Ferrari

1825
01:54:13,313 --> 01:54:16,407
A Ride in the Ferrari... Yeah

1826
01:54:20,186 --> 01:54:22,518
Hello?
- Rusy, come home quick

1827
01:54:23,022 --> 01:54:23,989
What happened, Uncle Pesi?

1828
01:54:24,057 --> 01:54:26,890
There're some ruffians here.
They're asking for 'Rustom'

1829
01:54:27,227 --> 01:54:29,422
Ok, I'm on my way

1830
01:54:30,797 --> 01:54:31,821
What happened, Papa?

1831
01:54:32,232 --> 01:54:33,062
Kayo, where's the money?

1832
01:54:33,266 --> 01:54:34,358
Here, in the bag

1833
01:54:43,476 --> 01:54:44,875
Pakya, the Ferrari

1834
01:54:49,048 --> 01:54:50,913
Kayo, stay inside

1835
01:54:53,419 --> 01:54:54,477
Rusy

1836
01:54:54,854 --> 01:54:56,287
Who are these people?

1837
01:54:56,856 --> 01:54:58,289
One moment

1838
01:54:58,424 --> 01:55:00,016
Who are these fellows?

1839
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:01,318
Let me talk to them

1840
01:55:02,462 --> 01:55:04,327
Pakya, what's the problem here?

1841
01:55:04,931 --> 01:55:07,525
Tell me, do you people
have no other names?

1842
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:11,894
I yelled 'Rustom' and
20 Rustoms came out

1843
01:55:12,572 --> 01:55:14,904
Then I asked them for the Ferrari

1844
01:55:15,041 --> 01:55:16,167
And they knew nothing of it

1845
01:55:16,409 --> 01:55:18,468
You didn't tell anyone
you have the Ferrari?

1846
01:55:18,845 --> 01:55:20,608
Pakya, what is the matter?

1847
01:55:21,447 --> 01:55:23,472
Please give me the Ferrari key

1848
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:25,415
I can't. I have to return the car now

1849
01:55:25,485 --> 01:55:27,282
Look wise guy...
- Easy, Pakya

1850
01:55:27,353 --> 01:55:27,876
It's ok, man

1851
01:55:27,954 --> 01:55:29,182
I've cleared this with Babbu didi

1852
01:55:29,222 --> 01:55:30,382
You can check with her

1853
01:55:31,057 --> 01:55:32,046
Don't mess with me

1854
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:33,126
Give me the Ferrari key

1855
01:55:33,126 --> 01:55:34,457
Pakya, that's not possible

1856
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,619
Pakya, I'm sorry,
that's not possible'

1857
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:38,353
Smart-ass

1858
01:55:38,431 --> 01:55:39,363
Pakya

1859
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:43,068
Why don't you speak to Babbu didi...

1860
01:55:43,136 --> 01:55:43,864
Papa

1861
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,406
Rusy, shall I call the cops?
- No, I'll take care of it

1862
01:55:46,406 --> 01:55:48,465
Ok, enough of your antics

1863
01:55:48,908 --> 01:55:51,433
Let go of me.
Pakya, this is wrong

1864
01:55:53,012 --> 01:55:55,276
Pakya, you can't take this car

1865
01:55:55,515 --> 01:55:57,039
I'm taking it. Get lost

1866
01:55:57,183 --> 01:55:58,047
Papa

1867
01:55:59,485 --> 01:56:00,887
This is Sachin's car.
You can't take it

1868
01:56:00,887 --> 01:56:01,911
My papa got it from office

1869
01:56:02,155 --> 01:56:03,122
Get out

1870
01:56:03,156 --> 01:56:04,646
Hey mister, don't touch him

1871
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:06,926
You can't take it.
It came to my papa's office

1872
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,552
How can you take it?
It's my papa's...

1873
01:56:08,594 --> 01:56:11,961
Listen squirt, he stole it.
From Sachin

1874
01:56:12,398 --> 01:56:14,992
Hey Bandit King -
you didn't tell him?

1875
01:56:19,005 --> 01:56:21,269
Papa, you stole Sachin's car?

1876
01:56:22,275 --> 01:56:23,640
What the...

1877
01:56:24,077 --> 01:56:25,066
Kayo, I...

1878
01:56:26,145 --> 01:56:28,204
Where do you think
you're taking the car?

1879
01:56:29,916 --> 01:56:30,917
Stop, scoundrel

1880
01:56:30,917 --> 01:56:32,145
Kayo, wait here

1881
01:56:33,186 --> 01:56:34,084
Papa

1882
01:56:41,995 --> 01:56:43,053
Taxi

1883
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:05,542
Mohan

1884
01:57:06,052 --> 01:57:07,576
It's almost midnight

1885
01:57:08,187 --> 01:57:10,280
Boss will be here soon

1886
01:57:11,591 --> 01:57:12,717
Tell me...

1887
01:57:14,093 --> 01:57:15,458
how much cash
do you have on you?

1888
01:57:16,095 --> 01:57:17,687
Look, a mobile temple

1889
01:57:18,164 --> 01:57:20,155
I have 500 bucks, Mohan

1890
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:23,234
But it's still ten days
to my next salary

1891
01:57:23,503 --> 01:57:26,063
You'll get the next salary
only if you get the Ferrari

1892
01:57:26,472 --> 01:57:27,666
C'mon, offer it all to God

1893
01:57:28,074 --> 01:57:31,407
Only He can save us now.
C'mon, let's donate this

1894
01:57:32,111 --> 01:57:38,573
Peace and Weahth breeze in.
Suffering beats a retreat

1895
01:57:38,651 --> 01:57:39,345
The Ferrari

1896
01:57:39,419 --> 01:57:40,044
Ferrari

1897
01:57:41,487 --> 01:57:42,681
The Ferrari!

1898
01:57:43,022 --> 01:57:44,546
It's the Ferrari, yes

1899
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:46,057
Mohan, this way

1900
01:57:46,092 --> 01:57:47,184
Hurry

1901
01:57:48,194 --> 01:57:49,422
Pakya

1902
01:57:50,196 --> 01:57:51,254
Get back inside

1903
01:57:56,035 --> 01:57:57,403
Found our Ferrari

1904
01:57:57,403 --> 01:57:58,665
Where?
- There, ahead

1905
01:57:58,771 --> 01:57:59,635
What happened?

1906
01:58:00,406 --> 01:58:01,338
I don't know

1907
01:58:01,574 --> 01:58:03,098
The Ferrari stopped

1908
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:05,568
Maybe the carburetor is clogged

1909
01:58:05,611 --> 01:58:07,738
Go check it, quick

1910
01:58:08,114 --> 01:58:09,348
Open the hood

1911
01:58:09,348 --> 01:58:10,550
Which button do I press?

1912
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:11,710
Press all the buttons

1913
01:58:13,186 --> 01:58:14,483
It's open

1914
01:58:15,221 --> 01:58:16,051
Pakya

1915
01:58:16,122 --> 01:58:16,611
What?

1916
01:58:16,756 --> 01:58:17,780
The engine fell out

1917
01:58:18,057 --> 01:58:18,523
What?

1918
01:58:20,693 --> 01:58:22,558
There's no hole underneath

1919
01:58:23,062 --> 01:58:24,086
How did it fall out?

1920
01:58:24,163 --> 01:58:24,652
Back off

1921
01:58:26,132 --> 01:58:27,497
Mohan

1922
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,099
The engine's gone

1923
01:58:29,335 --> 01:58:32,566
The engine's in
Shamshu's furnace

1924
01:58:32,705 --> 01:58:34,639
This car's engine is
in the back, you blockhead

1925
01:58:34,807 --> 01:58:36,035
Look in the back

1926
01:58:37,677 --> 01:58:39,372
Pakya, the engine's here

1927
01:58:39,512 --> 01:58:41,605
The engine is safe
in a glass box

1928
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:44,606
You. How did you know
the engine was in the back?

1929
01:58:44,784 --> 01:58:46,513
This is our boss's car

1930
01:58:46,552 --> 01:58:48,747
We also own an Alto, a Scorpio...

1931
01:58:48,788 --> 01:58:51,086
Tell him, Mohan
- Right

1932
01:58:51,257 --> 01:58:52,747
This is our boss's car.
Move away

1933
01:58:52,825 --> 01:58:54,486
If it's your boss's car...

1934
01:58:54,527 --> 01:58:56,392
tell me why it has stalled

1935
01:58:56,562 --> 01:58:58,086
Well, you see...

1936
01:58:58,264 --> 01:58:59,629
But why should I tell you?

1937
01:58:59,799 --> 01:59:02,063
Yes, who're you to ask?
Move aside

1938
01:59:02,201 --> 01:59:04,362
Go, Head of Security
- Take out the gun

1939
01:59:06,739 --> 01:59:07,706
What's wrong with the car?

1940
01:59:08,441 --> 01:59:11,342
The car's run out of gas

1941
01:59:11,511 --> 01:59:12,239
Now what?

1942
01:59:13,246 --> 01:59:14,440
Let's take gas from that scooter

1943
01:59:15,214 --> 01:59:17,614
Take gas from the scooter,
put it into the car

1944
01:59:17,717 --> 01:59:19,275
It's like this...

1945
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:22,110
You don't put regular gas
into a Ferrari

1946
01:59:22,355 --> 01:59:24,084
A special kind goes into it

1947
01:59:24,257 --> 01:59:27,658
And only we know
where to get it

1948
01:59:33,332 --> 01:59:34,230
Listen up

1949
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:35,733
Pakya
- Quiet

1950
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:38,662
Look, I need your help

1951
01:59:39,405 --> 01:59:40,736
This is your boss's Ferrari?

1952
01:59:40,806 --> 01:59:42,671
Get me to my wedding
in this Ferrari

1953
01:59:42,808 --> 01:59:44,742
Once I get there...

1954
01:59:44,877 --> 01:59:48,369
the car's yours.
You can take it back

1955
01:59:48,748 --> 01:59:52,309
If you don't help me,
then this engine...

1956
01:59:52,385 --> 01:59:54,444
No, don't

1957
01:59:54,554 --> 01:59:55,885
How will we get him there?

1958
01:59:56,155 --> 01:59:57,679
The Ferrari is out of gas

1959
01:59:58,558 --> 01:59:59,320
Well?

1960
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:03,356
The triahs of hife...

1961
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:06,456
I have an idea

1962
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:09,532
are eased by the Lord

1963
02:00:09,802 --> 02:00:12,669
Mohan, how much
farther is the gas station?

1964
02:00:12,838 --> 02:00:14,806
Why don't you take
the bullock's place?

1965
02:00:15,174 --> 02:00:16,232
We may reach faster

1966
02:00:17,476 --> 02:00:19,273
Any fractures?
- No sir

1967
02:00:42,902 --> 02:00:44,927
Hello, Uncle Pesi?
Rusy here

1968
02:00:45,304 --> 02:00:50,401
Could you please check on
Kayo at my house?

1969
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:52,177
He's not answering the phone

1970
02:00:52,311 --> 02:00:52,868
Thank you

1971
02:01:01,554 --> 02:01:02,418
He looks fine

1972
02:01:02,722 --> 02:01:04,952
Let's get a CT scan
- Ok sir

1973
02:01:08,628 --> 02:01:10,755
Rusy, Kayo is nowhere

1974
02:01:11,364 --> 02:01:11,955
You come home quick

1975
02:01:12,298 --> 02:01:15,324
Those goons were hanging
around for a long time

1976
02:01:29,849 --> 02:01:31,248
Kayo

1977
02:01:33,386 --> 02:01:35,217
Kayo

1978
02:01:40,493 --> 02:01:43,257
Rusy, where're you going?
- They're dangerous guys

1979
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:51,864
The dawn of auspicious days

1980
02:01:53,739 --> 02:01:57,231
Welcome, my friends
from the Press

1981
02:01:57,610 --> 02:02:02,843
Today, I give 201 couples
a loan-free life

1982
02:02:03,015 --> 02:02:04,812
No. 176 - Please come here

1983
02:02:05,418 --> 02:02:08,444
Of these, 200 are my social work

1984
02:02:08,921 --> 02:02:12,448
And 1 is my homework

1985
02:02:12,758 --> 02:02:13,725
My son Pakya

1986
02:02:16,962 --> 02:02:18,361
The Ferrari

1987
02:02:20,366 --> 02:02:23,028
Prakash Mandke, No. 201

1988
02:02:23,536 --> 02:02:24,870
That brings me to the end...

1989
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:26,895
TV crews
- Long live India

1990
02:02:27,006 --> 02:02:29,608
Here, look here

1991
02:02:29,608 --> 02:02:31,838
Here
- What's happening?

1992
02:02:32,345 --> 02:02:33,539
Hit it

1993
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:35,772
I will show you...

1994
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:38,610
I will give you Breaking News

1995
02:02:38,951 --> 02:02:40,418
Here a Pakya...

1996
02:02:40,820 --> 02:02:42,447
there a Pakya

1997
02:02:42,588 --> 02:02:46,459
Reporters, tell me
how many Pakyas?

1998
02:02:46,459 --> 02:02:47,585
So who's the real Pakya?

1999
02:02:47,626 --> 02:02:49,321
Follow me

2000
02:02:50,296 --> 02:02:52,059
You see this groom?

2001
02:02:52,398 --> 02:02:55,367
Now see my dad's social work

2002
02:02:55,468 --> 02:02:56,457
Look at this

2003
02:02:58,971 --> 02:02:59,665
Grandpa

2004
02:02:59,839 --> 02:03:01,636
His grandson is older than me

2005
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:04,875
That concludes
what I had to say...

2006
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,072
Oh no you don't

2007
02:03:08,414 --> 02:03:09,574
Who's this 201?

2008
02:03:09,782 --> 02:03:11,443
C'mon 201, lift your veil

2009
02:03:11,650 --> 02:03:12,674
Show yourself

2010
02:03:12,818 --> 02:03:14,479
What is this?
- Melodrama

2011
02:03:14,653 --> 02:03:17,520
I've learnt from what
I've seen since childhood

2012
02:03:19,024 --> 02:03:20,082
Should I shoot?

2013
02:03:20,359 --> 02:03:21,758
Aren't these your words?

2014
02:03:21,827 --> 02:03:22,953
1...

2015
02:03:23,462 --> 02:03:25,589
Should I shoot... 2...

2016
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:27,896
Should I shoot? Take this

2017
02:03:28,701 --> 02:03:30,464
What're you doing, son?

2018
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:31,862
Watch it

2019
02:03:32,037 --> 02:03:33,834
It's Babbu didi

2020
02:03:36,942 --> 02:03:39,809
Dad's made
laughing stock of you too

2021
02:03:40,946 --> 02:03:42,345
Pakya, where's my son?

2022
02:03:42,615 --> 02:03:43,775
Look, his son's also missing

2023
02:03:49,054 --> 02:03:50,043
Babbu didi?

2024
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:55,017
Pakya

2025
02:03:55,394 --> 02:03:57,419
Tell me where my son is,
or I'll shoot

2026
02:03:57,496 --> 02:03:59,623
Tell me

2027
02:04:00,366 --> 02:04:02,561
Mom, I don't know
where his son is

2028
02:04:02,601 --> 02:04:04,466
My son would never do that

2029
02:04:04,603 --> 02:04:06,628
He would never kidnap
someone's child

2030
02:04:06,705 --> 02:04:08,673
Rusy, wait

2031
02:04:08,774 --> 02:04:09,934
Where's his son?

2032
02:04:10,009 --> 02:04:11,943
I swear I don't know.
Ask them

2033
02:04:12,011 --> 02:04:13,638
Where's his son?

2034
02:04:13,712 --> 02:04:15,942
When we left, he was
running towards the sea

2035
02:04:16,081 --> 02:04:17,673
And he was crying

2036
02:04:19,084 --> 02:04:22,383
Mom, this guy stole the Ferrari

2037
02:04:22,588 --> 02:04:24,055
His son got to know

2038
02:04:24,490 --> 02:04:27,948
I think he's gone towards
the sea to commit suicide

2039
02:04:27,993 --> 02:04:29,085
Be quiet

2040
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:33,726
Suicide? Your son's
committed suicide?

2041
02:04:36,769 --> 02:04:39,567
You've lost your son.
How do you feel?

2042
02:04:39,738 --> 02:04:41,535
Do you think he killed himself?

2043
02:04:41,674 --> 02:04:43,699
Where must he be?
- What happened, sir?

2044
02:04:44,043 --> 02:04:48,002
Where is your son?
What is your answer?

2045
02:04:52,751 --> 02:04:53,410
Everyone look here

2046
02:04:53,486 --> 02:04:56,614
If you live near the beach,
please come out of your home

2047
02:04:56,789 --> 02:04:58,051
Please rush to the beach

2048
02:04:58,190 --> 02:05:00,454
If you see a child running,
please stop him

2049
02:05:00,526 --> 02:05:01,754
He's my son, Kayo

2050
02:05:02,061 --> 02:05:03,585
He runs very fast

2051
02:05:03,829 --> 02:05:06,195
Don't let him go near the water

2052
02:05:07,066 --> 02:05:09,125
Not into the sea

2053
02:05:12,605 --> 02:05:14,573
My son's this high

2054
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:16,139
4 feet, 9 inches

2055
02:05:16,575 --> 02:05:18,770
Dusky skin

2056
02:05:19,545 --> 02:05:20,671
This is him

2057
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:22,674
He's always smiling

2058
02:05:23,516 --> 02:05:26,974
Kayoze Rustom Deboo.
His full name

2059
02:05:29,788 --> 02:05:31,722
Kayo, I didn't know what to do

2060
02:05:32,858 --> 02:05:34,485
Couldn't get a loan from work

2061
02:05:34,793 --> 02:05:36,784
The bank refused me a loan

2062
02:05:37,596 --> 02:05:39,461
I didn't mean to steal, Kayo

2063
02:05:40,766 --> 02:05:42,757
I made a mistake

2064
02:05:44,970 --> 02:05:46,699
Grandpa is right

2065
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:50,140
We shouldn't dream at all

2066
02:05:52,478 --> 02:05:56,073
Please give me back my Kayo.
I can't live without him

2067
02:05:57,983 --> 02:06:01,544
If you want to contact me,
call me on my phone...

2068
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:03,884
7498520498

2069
02:06:04,957 --> 02:06:07,187
Listen, you guys
search Girgaum beach

2070
02:06:07,493 --> 02:06:08,926
I'll check Dadar and Juhu beach

2071
02:06:09,762 --> 02:06:12,492
Keep in touch with me.
Call me every 5 minutes

2072
02:06:13,032 --> 02:06:14,795
I'm just leaving home...

2073
02:06:16,535 --> 02:06:18,196
I'll call you back

2074
02:06:20,205 --> 02:06:22,036
Kayo, where have you been?

2075
02:06:24,543 --> 02:06:26,101
Sir, Papa...

2076
02:06:28,614 --> 02:06:33,244
Sir, the police will take
Papa away. Please help me

2077
02:06:34,653 --> 02:06:36,280
Whoever finds my son
can have my apartment

2078
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:38,924
It has one bedroom
and a large living room

2079
02:06:38,924 --> 02:06:40,993
Just find my son please

2080
02:06:40,993 --> 02:06:41,857
Rusy?

2081
02:06:41,961 --> 02:06:44,828
Please help me

2082
02:06:47,166 --> 02:06:47,860
Hello?

2083
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,695
Rusy

2084
02:06:53,572 --> 02:06:55,836
Papa, Kayo's gone

2085
02:06:56,675 --> 02:06:58,700
Kayo's gone

2086
02:06:59,912 --> 02:07:00,879
Papa

2087
02:07:05,184 --> 02:07:06,082
Papa

2088
02:07:08,153 --> 02:07:09,552
Kayo

2089
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:12,318
Where were you?

2090
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:23,028
I'm sorry, son

2091
02:07:32,344 --> 02:07:33,811
I'm sorry, Kayo

2092
02:07:36,015 --> 02:07:39,041
I'm really sorry,
I shouldn't have done it

2093
02:07:39,752 --> 02:07:43,017
If I don't go to Lord's,
you think I won't play cricket?

2094
02:07:46,992 --> 02:07:49,358
I have the world's best coach

2095
02:07:50,062 --> 02:07:51,757
He'll train me

2096
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:55,061
And you know, Sachin
didn't train at Lord's

2097
02:07:55,601 --> 02:07:57,728
He trained right here,
at Shivaji Park

2098
02:07:57,970 --> 02:07:59,335
And became the No. 1 cricketer

2099
02:07:59,772 --> 02:08:00,898
I'll be No. 1 too

2100
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:02,834
100 centuries

2101
02:08:05,978 --> 02:08:08,208
Don't be upset, Papa

2102
02:08:08,847 --> 02:08:10,246
C'mon, be a good boy

2103
02:08:13,752 --> 02:08:16,050
Tomorrow, if I tell you
I want to go to the moon...

2104
02:08:16,255 --> 02:08:18,120
will you steal a spaceship
from NASA?

2105
02:08:19,024 --> 02:08:20,821
You understand, Papa?

2106
02:08:22,261 --> 02:08:24,957
I understand, Kayo

2107
02:08:25,998 --> 02:08:28,091
Now you'll say -
Look at the brighter side of life

2108
02:08:28,267 --> 02:08:29,199
Actually yes, Papa

2109
02:08:29,334 --> 02:08:31,894
If I'd gone to Lord's,
I would have gone alone

2110
02:08:32,337 --> 02:08:33,998
When I'm selected
for the Indian team...

2111
02:08:34,139 --> 02:08:35,834
I'll take you with me

2112
02:08:36,108 --> 02:08:37,803
I'll tell the Cricket Board clearly...

2113
02:08:37,876 --> 02:08:40,902
If you want Kayo in the team,
you have to take Papa along

2114
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:42,943
I can't sleep without you

2115
02:08:43,148 --> 02:08:45,673
And who will wake me
for the match in the morning?

2116
02:08:47,686 --> 02:08:48,983
My Kayo's grown up

2117
02:08:50,856 --> 02:08:52,289
Grown up too soon

2118
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:57,753
The flight has landed

2119
02:08:58,263 --> 02:08:59,696
Boss is back

2120
02:09:03,202 --> 02:09:05,170
Sorry, but can you
please hurry up?

2121
02:09:05,938 --> 02:09:08,304
Our boss's flight has landed

2122
02:09:08,941 --> 02:09:12,672
We have to take the Ferrari back

2123
02:09:23,255 --> 02:09:26,088
Babbu didi,
please return this money

2124
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:29,787
Pakya, could you...

2125
02:09:32,765 --> 02:09:33,356
Thank you

2126
02:09:36,168 --> 02:09:37,066
The key, sir

2127
02:09:39,238 --> 02:09:40,466
Please forgive me

2128
02:09:40,873 --> 02:09:43,842
I must ask Sachin
for forgiveness too

2129
02:09:44,143 --> 02:09:46,168
Not today, sir.
We'll handle it from here

2130
02:09:46,411 --> 02:09:47,810
Meet him another day

2131
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:50,073
You can take a photo
with him too

2132
02:09:50,215 --> 02:09:53,241
Yes. Sorry, got to rush now

2133
02:10:04,429 --> 02:10:05,453
Yes, I'll open it

2134
02:10:06,098 --> 02:10:08,032
Pandey, Boss not back yet?

2135
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:09,030
Boss is back

2136
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:10,868
When?
- Right now

2137
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:12,937
Open it, quick

2138
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:32,479
Please don't tell anyone
I gave out the Ferrari key

2139
02:10:32,991 --> 02:10:35,357
Please don't tell anyone
that I opened the gate

2140
02:10:35,527 --> 02:10:37,427
I would've lost my
status in the village

2141
02:10:37,830 --> 02:10:39,457
Saved
- Don't worry

2142
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:42,989
Well done

2143
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:49,404
Kayo

2144
02:10:50,475 --> 02:10:52,102
You know something?

2145
02:10:53,178 --> 02:10:57,410
You put a ball into a sock
and kept knocking it

2146
02:10:57,883 --> 02:11:01,011
That really irritated me

2147
02:11:02,354 --> 02:11:04,015
Now throw away that rotting sock

2148
02:11:04,223 --> 02:11:06,953
I'll come to the nets.
I will train you

2149
02:11:07,893 --> 02:11:10,418
You will play for India

2150
02:11:10,796 --> 02:11:12,889
You don't need to
go to London

2151
02:11:13,165 --> 02:11:14,928
Those players
should come here

2152
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:16,567
We could teach
them a thing or two

2153
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:21,005
Stop here

2154
02:11:22,241 --> 02:11:24,076
C'mon little one,
give me a hand

2155
02:11:24,076 --> 02:11:25,566
Who are these people?

2156
02:11:30,015 --> 02:11:32,506
Uncle Rusy, put Rs. 50 in this

2157
02:11:34,152 --> 02:11:36,552
There you go

2158
02:11:37,956 --> 02:11:39,423
It's done

2159
02:11:41,026 --> 02:11:44,860
We'd collected Rs.149,950

2160
02:11:45,130 --> 02:11:48,964
Now we have the complete
amount of 150,000

2161
02:11:51,169 --> 02:11:52,329
This is for you

2162
02:11:52,537 --> 02:11:53,902
But what is all this?

2163
02:11:54,139 --> 02:11:58,439
Rusy, our Kayo will
go to London now

2164
02:11:59,011 --> 02:12:00,342
Uncle Rusy...

2165
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:02,913
this lady contributed
the largest bundle

2166
02:12:03,181 --> 02:12:04,375
Come on up

2167
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:08,849
The gentleman from the bank
also put in a big amount

2168
02:12:09,254 --> 02:12:13,953
And everyone from the colony
brought in 50,000 rupees

2169
02:12:14,226 --> 02:12:16,023
Now where's the gentleman
from the shop?

2170
02:12:16,328 --> 02:12:17,852
I'm here

2171
02:12:18,864 --> 02:12:21,492
And these are the shoes
you had marked

2172
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:22,992
Kayo

2173
02:12:23,201 --> 02:12:25,897
All of us saw you on TV

2174
02:12:26,171 --> 02:12:28,969
Thank you, but I can't take this

2175
02:12:29,141 --> 02:12:30,301
Why not?

2176
02:12:30,509 --> 02:12:32,443
We're not giving it
to you for nothing

2177
02:12:32,644 --> 02:12:35,204
We all want a ride
in the Ferrari

2178
02:12:36,281 --> 02:12:38,442
But the Ferrari is back
at Sachin's house

2179
02:12:38,517 --> 02:12:40,041
Sachin's Ferrari?

2180
02:12:40,185 --> 02:12:42,016
Want Sachin's Ferrari?
- No

2181
02:12:42,054 --> 02:12:43,988
We don't want Sachin's Ferrari

2182
02:12:44,189 --> 02:12:47,124
We want our Kayo's Ferrari

2183
02:12:47,926 --> 02:12:50,952
Look, he will play for
India some day, right?

2184
02:12:51,029 --> 02:12:52,428
Will he?
- Definitely

2185
02:12:52,497 --> 02:12:54,226
There, Papa has spoken

2186
02:12:54,466 --> 02:12:58,232
So when Kayo plays for India,
won't he buy a Ferrari?

2187
02:12:58,503 --> 02:13:00,266
Won't he?
- Definitely

2188
02:13:00,439 --> 02:13:01,531
Then it's settled

2189
02:13:01,907 --> 02:13:06,276
So this is the rental fee for
Kayo's Ferrari, in advance

2190
02:13:08,046 --> 02:13:09,138
Thank you, but I can't...

2191
02:13:10,549 --> 02:13:14,041
When you get the EPF loan,
return everyone's money

2192
02:13:14,453 --> 02:13:15,920
But I don't know...

2193
02:13:15,954 --> 02:13:17,422
if you'll get the
EPF loan before...

2194
02:13:17,422 --> 02:13:18,684
you get Kayo's Ferrari

2195
02:13:21,226 --> 02:13:23,990
Hey King of Honesty,
don't think so much

2196
02:13:24,162 --> 02:13:26,960
The signal's turn green.
Zoom off to London

2197
02:13:27,265 --> 02:13:29,392
Hey Champion of Truth,
send him off

2198
02:14:50,715 --> 02:14:53,684
May this mind...

2199
02:14:54,386 --> 02:14:58,686
Its thoughts and deeds

2200
02:14:59,324 --> 02:15:03,658
Every stride and step

2201
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:09,667
Tread the path of Truth

2202
02:15:10,502 --> 02:15:13,699
Stand strong...

2203
02:15:14,306 --> 02:15:18,675
On the tough, honest path

2204
02:15:19,144 --> 02:15:23,513
And remain fearhess
and unwavering

2205
02:15:24,049 --> 02:15:26,517
Ahways. With head hehd high

2206
02:15:32,290 --> 02:15:33,587
Hurry up, Rusy

2207
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:37,653
There he is... There's Kayo

2208
02:15:46,171 --> 02:15:48,537
C'mon Kayo

2209
02:16:03,722 --> 02:16:05,349
He's hit a 6...

2210
02:16:05,524 --> 02:16:06,786
And now a 4

2211
02:16:07,192 --> 02:16:09,861
Something zooms up...
Look, it's our score!

2212
02:16:09,861 --> 02:16:11,328
Go Kayo

2213
02:16:13,698 --> 02:16:15,333
He's hit a 6...

2214
02:16:15,333 --> 02:16:16,823
And now a 4

2215
02:16:17,135 --> 02:16:20,104
Something zooms up...
Look, it's our score!

2216
02:16:20,438 --> 02:16:23,430
The crowds hunger for runs...
They gotta have more

2217
02:16:23,675 --> 02:16:26,269
More...

2218
02:16:26,578 --> 02:16:27,840
A big hit
