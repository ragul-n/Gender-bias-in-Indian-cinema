26
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,998
This world.

27
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:12,098
This atmosphere.

28
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,568
It's of no use to me.

29
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:16,203
'No, no, no.

30
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:18,004
They're singing the wrong song.'

31
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,639
'No one is heartbroken here.'

32
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,608
'Actually, a tradition has been broken here.'

33
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,577
'They are celebrating that.'

34
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,379
'This is a family of constables.'

35
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,047
'Since the last four generations.'

36
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,383
'..the men of this family have been constables.'

37
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,785
'..and have retired as constables.'

38
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,788
'But today, the son of this family..'

39
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,858
'..Fateh Singh has broken this tradition.'

40
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,307
Put it up properly.

41
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,528
- I'm doing it.

42
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,709
Aunt, come outside.

43
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:44,264
Brother Fateh has come.

44
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,740
My baby! My sweetheart!

45
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,434
- 'He did become a constable at first..'

46
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,236
'..but he won't retire as a constable.'

47
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,513
'..since he has become an inspector now.'

48
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,883
'There are many who didn't expect this from Fateh.'

49
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,152
'They're embarrassed now.'

50
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,388
You guys are embarrassed now.

51
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,524
I'm a policeman now.

52
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,760
Hello.

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,128
Hello! Hello!

54
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,198
Uncle, how are you?

55
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:17,830
- I'm fine, son. Very well.

56
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,853
What would you say?

57
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,200
A family of constables?

58
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,235
We had gotten used to saluting to such an extent..

59
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:26,105
"That even when a vegetable vendor called out to us, we would salute.

60
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,240
Be careful, I'm warning you.

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,245
My family only salutes, but your family could be ruined.

62
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,913
Master, give me your blessings. Hello.

63
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:34,972
Bless you, son.

64
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:35,748
Bless you.

65
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,116
What would you say?

66
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,451
Son, you can't even cross the 10th class.

67
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,485
I got through the 10th class.

68
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,354
Now you cross the police station and show me.

69
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,022
You can't even write an essay on the Punjab police.

70
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:46,426
Nowadays essays are being written on us, master.

71
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,561
No, son. It's not that.

72
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,598
I always knew that you would achieve something when you grow up.

73
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,799
I've achieved it now, that's why you feel so.

74
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,234
You would call me useless earlier.

75
00:03:54,234 --> 00:04:01,307
Don't you dare call a child useless again!

76
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,476
Son. - Yes?

77
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,246
Should we talk about your marriage with our Nikki?

78
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,948
How can we get our girl married to this idiot?

79
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,450
This is what you would say, right?

80
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,085
How can I falsify your statement?

81
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,354
Come on, have tea and get going. Okay?

82
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,256
Otherwise I may have to throw you out.

83
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,263
My baby!

84
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:19,150
My sweetheart!

85
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,660
My darling!

86
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,298
My son looks so handsome wearing an inspector's uniform.

87
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,733
You look so good, son.

88
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,147
You've given birth to a handsome son.

89
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:29,369
The uniform is just an excuse.

90
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,471
He has gone on his father.

91
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,038
Shut up.

92
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,307
I will break your teeth with a hammer.

93
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,248
I will complain.

94
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:36,542
- You will complain!

95
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,679
If he was like you, he would have remained a constable like your family.

96
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,614
He wouldn't have become an inspector.

97
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,382
Don't you dare!

98
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,018
Today your love overﬂows.

99
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:45,859
Come on, son.

100
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,222
The whole village wants to get pictures clicked with you.

101
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,234
But mother, I feel like dancing.

102
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,024
Can we dance right now?

103
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,292
Let's do it.

104
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,727
My son will dance.

105
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:58,971
It's of no use to me.

106
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,801
This world..

107
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,469
Get lost. - Mike?

108
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,973
Strange.
They don't even let you sing.

109
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,309
Stop it. What is this?

110
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,344
I will sing myself. Come on.

111
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,140
We wear a turban.

112
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,782
We are men of attitude.

113
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:20,119
We are egoistic and strong.

114
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,455
We are very gutsy.

115
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,392
No one can stand in front of us.

116
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,997
The dance of the Punjabis will make them look like kings today.

117
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,723
Vacate the place.

118
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,668
Mr. Singh will dance today.

119
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,197
Vacate the place.

120
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:39,806
Mr. Singh will dance today.

121
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,434
Vacate the place.

122
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,210
Mr. Singh will dance today.

123
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:53,686
Mr. Singh will dance today.

124
00:05:53,686 --> 00:06:03,696
Dance.

125
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:12,739
When we prosper, people get jealous of us.

126
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,697
We're clean at heart.

127
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:19,078
We never cheat anyone.

128
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:23,383
Only we can carry off style.

129
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,072
Vacate the place.

130
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,954
Mr. Singh will dance today.

131
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:32,158
Vacate the place.
Mr. Singh will dance today.

132
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,675
Vacate the place.

133
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:36,262
Mr. Singh will dance today.

134
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,830
Mr. Singh will dance today.

135
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:45,938
Dance.

136
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:56,149
Dance.

137
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,768
We live happily.

138
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:04,824
We drink a little when we're happy.

139
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,118
We're stubborn, but great at heart.

140
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:11,130
We celebrate on a grand scale.

141
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,735
Not one, but two drums will be played till late at night.

142
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:20,273
Vacate the place.
Mr. Singh will dance today.

143
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,925
Vacate the place.

144
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:24,744
Mr. Singh will dance today.

145
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,848
Vacate the place.
Mr. Singh will dance today.

146
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,463
Vacate the place.

147
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:33,219
Mr. Singh will dance today.

148
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,488
Mr. Singh will dance today.

149
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:43,229
Mr. Singh will dance today.

150
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,131
The inspector is so strange.

151
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,449
I wonder where I've kept it.

152
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,602
- I didn't find it, sir.

153
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,309
You idiots!

154
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:53,139
The whole department couldn't find my uniform?

155
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:53,652
Have some shame!

156
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:54,807
- Sir, you're the one who's naked.

157
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,375
Why should we have shame?

158
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,811
My eyes are red and I have three stars on my shoulder.

159
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,847
You're joking with Inspector Joginder?

160
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,248
Consider yourself closer to death.

161
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,951
Go and look for my uniform!
- Yes!

162
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,319
The Inspector is roaming about in boxers.

163
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,720
What if someone comes to lodge a complaint?

164
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,356
Sir, good morning!

165
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:14,293
Sir, your uniform!

166
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,629
You're wearing my uniform?

167
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,832
How did a constable dare to wear an inspector's uniform!

168
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,334
Sir, why are you getting so angry?

169
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,236
If I wore yours, you should have worn mine.

170
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,237
Don't mind.

171
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,740
When a person is in danger, he runs towards even more dangerous people.

172
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,342
You're talking like that to your senior?

173
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,476
I'll fire you!

174
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,677
How can you fire me, sir?

175
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,579
I work for the government, not for you.

176
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,015
I respect you because you're senior to me.

177
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,250
Or else I would have flailed you.

178
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,119
If you talk nonsense, then I'll show you what real nonsense is.

179
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,854
Just tell me what 'flail' means.

180
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,189
What will you get by knowing the meaning?

181
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:43,901
Get your uniform washed.

182
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:45,324
I wonder when you got it washed the last time.

183
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:45,912
It's stinking.

184
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:47,593
Moreover, you're getting furious at me.

185
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:48,710
Reduce your stomach, sir.

186
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,229
Your pant is a bit loose for me.

187
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,698
Stop your..
- Excuse me, Inspector.

188
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,190
Yes, madam?

189
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:54,934
- Actually, my purse has been stolen.

190
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,235
So, I've come to lodge a complaint.

191
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,436
Madam, talk to me.

192
00:08:57,462 --> 00:09:00,106
Tell me, of what color was your purse?

193
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:05,344
Actually, I want the inspector to lodge my complaint, not the peon.

194
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,914
Madam, for your kind information, I'm not a peon.

195
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,292
I'm in charge of this police station.

196
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:10,483
Inspector Joginder Singh Brar.

197
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,185
In your boxers?

198
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,589
You've only seen the hands of law so far.

199
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,791
So what if you've seen the legs of the law today?

200
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,260
It's another matter that the legs of the law are a little thin..

201
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,663
"But still, you can lodge your complaint.

202
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,365
I want the commissioner to lodge my complaint.

203
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,199
Commissioner?

204
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,936
Yes. If this man wearing boxers is an inspector"

205
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,104
"then you must be the commissioner.

206
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,140
Ma'am, if it's about the commissioner, then come with me.

207
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,441
I'll record your complaint.

208
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,709
You've lost one purse, right?
- Yes.

209
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,244
The Punjab Police will find four for you.

210
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,545
Come with me.

211
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:44,317
Madam, please listen to me.

212
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,034
Sir, you really get yourself insulted very well.

213
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,254
- Stop your nonsense!

214
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,523
Since he has come to this police station..

215
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,558
...he has made my life miserable.

216
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:53,635
He took my uniform today.

217
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,661
He could take my position too, in the future.

218
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,458
Why don't you talk to the DC?

219
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:59,131
He is like family to you.

220
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,466
What will I tell the DC?

221
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:01,968
That he stole my uniform?

222
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,636
He'll say that a person who can't take care of his uniform..

223
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,171
...how will he take care of the police station?

224
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,405
But sir, what do we do now?

225
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,775
We'll just have to wait for the right opportunity.

226
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,044
He took my uniform for a day.

227
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,046
If I don't take away his uniform for good..

228
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,850
...I won't be called Inspector Joginder Singh.

229
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,586
Fateh, I don't understand something.

230
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,921
Why did you borrow the inspector's uniform?

231
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,389
Shera, I was helpless.

232
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,359
The men of four generations in my family have retired as constables.

233
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,532
I had to shut people up.

234
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:29,095
I was under a lot of pressure.

235
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,520
I lied at home that I've become an inspector.

236
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:32,732
That I've been promoted.

237
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,101
I wore the inspector's uniform yesterday and took rounds in the village.

238
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,269
Now I don't have to worry for the next five to seven months.

239
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,639
We'll think of what has to be done later.

240
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,874
It's mother's call.

241
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,015
Hello, mother.

242
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,560
Hello.

243
00:10:43,586 --> 00:10:45,378
- Hello. Hello, son.

244
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,298
How is my dear son doing?

245
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:48,681
How's your work?

246
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,364
The work is fine.

247
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:49,898
You tell me.

248
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:50,449
How are you?

249
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,901
There's good news.

250
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:54,887
There's a marriage proposal for you.

251
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,175
There's a proposal for me?

252
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:56,522
- Yes.

253
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,457
The girl's family wanted to meet you.

254
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,794
I told them that my son is an inspector.

255
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,629
He's not sitting idle that he can take an off and come.

256
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,432
So, we decided that we'll come to the police station..

257
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,201
...along with the girl and her family next month.

258
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,469
Why will you come to the police station?

259
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:14,206
Let them also see my son's position.

260
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,741
But mother" - Listen.

261
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,043
The master was saying

262
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,679
that he too will come to the police station with us.

263
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,347
Mother, what will the master do here?

264
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,917
He was saying that he wants to get his passport signed.

265
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,721
He was saying that my inspector son will have to sign.

266
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,497
Okay, son.

267
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,058
Do your work. You must be busy.

268
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,695
Okay. Bye.

269
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:37,596
- No, no..

270
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:42,735
Fateh, if your lie is caught, you'll be humiliated in the village.

271
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,675
What do I do now?

272
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:44,670
I'll be finished.

273
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,717
What's the matter?

274
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:46,939
- I'm tense, Shera.

275
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,525
The police don't worry.

276
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:50,042
They trouble others.

277
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,409
Forget all that.

278
00:11:51,435 --> 00:11:53,546
Let's go on the rounds.

279
00:11:53,546 --> 00:12:04,590
Let's catch someone and make some money.

280
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,437
Shampy son.

281
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:09,628
Father's only son.

282
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,697
Goes to Canada.

283
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:17,002
Now he will not return, father.

284
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,237
Police! Father, police!

285
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:18,746
Stop! Stop!

286
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:19,691
- Stop! Stop! stop!

287
00:12:19,717 --> 00:12:20,272
Stop! Stop!

288
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,574
Stop this scooter.

289
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,442
Sir, this is not a scooter.

290
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,211
This is Shampy's love.

291
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,979
Why are you stopping us?

292
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,481
We want to worship you.

293
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,882
Show me the papers of the vehicle.

294
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,450
We have all the papers.

295
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,014
Take this.

296
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,692
Check them.

297
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,819
- Check it, Shera.

298
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,788
Give me.
- But please hurry up, brother.

299
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,880
Why? Why are you in a hurry?

300
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:38,090
Are you going to get engaged?

301
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,428
That's very expensive these days, brother.

302
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:48,000
Nowadays in weddings we do things in a cheaper way.

303
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,302
Father, what are you saying?

304
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:54,039
Just tell brother clearly that I am going to the airport..

305
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,775
...to board a flight to Canada.

306
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,477
The papers are fine.

307
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,346
Shampy is going to Canada!

308
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:03,983
Passport!

309
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,484
How can you go to Canada?

310
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,136
Pay a fine for three pillions.

311
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:07,686
Come on.

312
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,718
How three pillions?

313
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,022
We're just two people.

314
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,124
The two of you and the third one is your God.

315
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,283
Why have you written behind?

316
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,193
That God is with us?

317
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,435
That makes it three pillions.

318
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,062
- But brother, God is with everyone.

319
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:17,914
No. He's not with me.

320
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,131
I'm in a very bad condition.

321
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,566
Pay Rs. 500.

322
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,934
Brother, let's do one thing.

323
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,072
Let's bargain on the rate.

324
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:23,903
Please reduce it.

325
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,337
You're bargaining with the Punjab Police?

326
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,672
I'll flail you!

327
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,107
What does that mean?

328
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,262
What will you do with the meaning?

329
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:29,942
Give me the money!

330
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,711
Brother, don't talk to us like that!

331
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,881
You are a constable and you're demanding an inspector's fine.

332
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,716
Constable!
Should I show you what I am?

333
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,518
He slapped your dear son.

334
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,121
Beat me as much as you want, but please let me go to Canada.

335
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,589
For now, you'll go to prison.

336
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,757
If you stay in prison for four days..

337
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,292
...your father will pay 2500 instead of 500.

338
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,159
You call me constable.

339
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,814
He slapped your dear son twice.

340
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,362
Father, what are you doing?

341
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,389
Father! What are you doing?

342
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:52,264
- Come here.
 Come on.

343
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,766
Come on. - Father! Father!

344
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,515
Please stop them!

345
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,968
Please!
I have to go to Canada.

346
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,838
Couldn't you have kept quiet, you idiot?

347
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,140
Now, instead of going abroad, you'll go to prison.

348
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,742
Come on.
- Your dear son was slapped thrice!

349
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,197
Father, you betrayed me!

350
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:07,082
Come on!

351
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:08,877
- Love you, son!

352
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:09,982
Love you!

353
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:14,084
DCP, what made you call me today?

354
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,322
Just command me.

355
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,558
You might find this strange.

356
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:24,029
I want to discuss a personal problem with you.

357
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,483
Tell me, sir.

358
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:28,167
- Joginder, you know..

359
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,302
"That I have no family.

360
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:35,074
18 years ago, my wife left with my 6-year-old daughter.

361
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,709
Why, sir?

362
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,177
Because we divorced.

363
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,112
You're lucky.

364
00:14:39,138 --> 00:14:42,348
My wife says she won't leave me until I die.

365
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,932
No, Joginder.

366
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,586
Even I felt the same before.

367
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,523
But now, I feel lonely.

368
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:57,229
I feel like my family, my daughter should be with me.

369
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,509
So, what's the problem, sir?

370
00:14:58,535 --> 00:14:59,698
Call your daughter here.

371
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,542
No, Joginder.

372
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,236
It's not that easy.

373
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,206
During our divorce, it was the court's order that.

374
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:12,544
...I can't meet my daughter without my wife's permission.

375
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:16,115
So, sir, didn't you ever try to meet her after that?

376
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,851
I did.

377
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,955
But my wife took Pooja to Canada.

378
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,491
It's been so many years.

379
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,695
I haven't even seen my daughter's face.

380
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:33,966
I don't know anything about her..

381
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,635
...besides the fact.

382
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:41,140
"That she owns a beauty parlor in Canada.

383
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,008
Joginder.

384
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:48,881
I feel like someone should go there somehow..

385
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:56,455
...and bring my daughter back to me.

386
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,091
Sir, do you think this is easy?

387
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,995
No. Absolutely not.

388
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:07,466
This can be done only if God helps me.

389
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,536
Sir, consider your work done.
- How?

390
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:15,474
I know a person who can do this very easily.

391
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,576
Who's that? - He's the most hardworking constable..

392
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,812
...In the Punjab Police.
Fateh Singh.

393
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,046
If it is so..

394
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,615
...then make arrangements to send him to Canada immediately.

395
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,251
Consider this done, sir.

396
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,154
Canada? - Yes.

397
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,523
But sir, how can I bring the DC's daughter to Punjab?

398
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,359
Silly, only you can bring her back.

399
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,862
After all, you're the most hardworking constable in the Punjab Police.

400
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,531
Sir, I don't normally drink.

401
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,734
But I feel like drinking this.

402
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:46,472
Shall I drink? -Yes, sure.

403
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,606
I drank it.

404
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,837
Sir, tell me something.

405
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:50,709
How will I benefit from all this?

406
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,444
Silly, you're the only one who'll benefit.

407
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,546
If you do this successfully, then you can come back..

408
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,949
...and demand whatever you want from the DC.

409
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,118
I can demand whatever I want?
- Of course.

410
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,620
This means if I bring the DC's daughter to Punjab..

411
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,155
...I can become an inspector too?

412
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,324
Consider yourself the inspector already.

413
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,700
I am an inspector?

414
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:07,693
- Of course.

415
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,881
Then sir, don't make a constable's drink.

416
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:12,931
Make an inspector's drink.

417
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,901
You greedy man!

418
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:20,105
Enough, sir. Don't make me the DC.

419
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,765
By the way, you're a scoundrel.

420
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,245
- Same to you, sir.

421
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,113
There's no need to behave like that with me.

422
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:28,749
I'm your senior.

423
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,016
My eyes are red and there are three stars on my shoulder.

424
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,585
You're competing with Inspector Joginder?

425
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,289
Consider yourself closer to success.

426
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,824
Love you, sir.

427
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,893
Thank you.
- But sir, tell me something.

428
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,094
If I go abroad..

429
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,364
...then who will pay for my accommodation and travelling there?

430
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,067
Silly, a government official doesn't spend from his pocket.

431
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,568
The government will pay for you.

432
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,836
The government?
- Yes.

433
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:51,640
But how, sir?

434
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,372
- Just make a false case..

435
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,641
...to solve which you will be going to Canada.

436
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,811
Then the government will pay and you will enjoy.

437
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,612
But sir, it doesn't look nice.

438
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:07,486
Did it look nice when you stole my uniform?

439
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:11,490
And even ministers make such excuses and go abroad.

440
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,625
They don't go to work.

441
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,594
Sir, you have a point.

442
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,962
But sir, if we have to make a false case..

443
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,597
...then where will we get a criminal from?

444
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:24,603
You have a point.

445
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,339
Brother.'

446
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,574
Brother.

447
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,644
Respected sir, please let me go.

448
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,546
Please have mercy on me.

449
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:39,518
If you have mercy on me, then God will have mercy on you.

450
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,155
Brother, I request you.

451
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,524
Please have mercy.

452
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:51,130
I have to go to the great land of Canada before my visa expires.

453
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,165
Let go of your dear son.

454
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,818
I need your help.

455
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,537
Please.

456
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:02,074
Help.. Help..

457
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,377
Help.. Help..

458
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,478
Shampy, the dacoit?

459
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,876
Sir, it's an old case.

460
00:19:07,902 --> 00:19:11,116
We've heard that he smuggles in Canada these days.

461
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,751
Fateh will go there to catch him.

462
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,820
Firstly, we'll get a visa soon.

463
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:20,225
Moreover, we won't have to worry about the expenses.

464
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:24,014
Whose idea was this?

465
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,098
- Fateh's.

466
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,700
I'm impressed. Good.

467
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,135
Joginder. -Yes, sir.

468
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,570
You were right.

469
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,673
Fateh is the most hardworking constable in the Punjab Police.

470
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,542
But sir, I want to be the most hardworking..

471
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,943
"Inspector in the Punjab Police.

472
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,511
Don't worry, son.

473
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,154
Just do this for me.

474
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,714
I'll promote you.

475
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,818
Even if I have to remove Joginder's uniform and give it to you.

476
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,955
Anyway, his uniform fits me, sir.

477
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,373
It's stretchable.

478
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,624
It fits anyone.

479
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,761
Whether a constable wears it or a DCP.

480
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:56,929
What?
- Sorry, sir.

481
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,130
Sir, don't worry.

482
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,066
Your daughter will be standing in front of you within a month.

483
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,367
Very good.
- Yes.

484
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,235
Come, Fateh.
-Yes.

485
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,370
I'll give you some more details about Pooja.
- Okay.

486
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,338
And Joginder.
- Sir.

487
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,907
Fax this file to the Canada police.
- Okay, sir.

488
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,611
Come, Fateh.
- Okay, sir.

489
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,977
Joginder, have you made the wrong move?

490
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,144
Hi. - Good morning.

491
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,346
Good morning, Singh.

492
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,182
By the way, the chief wants to see you in his office.

493
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,918
Okay.

494
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,020
So, what do you think, Singh?

495
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,121
I'm sorry, sir.

496
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,190
I'm ready to handle this case by myself.

497
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,792
But being a partner of an officer of the Punjab Police?

498
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:01,760
I'm sorry, sir.

499
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,861
But why?

500
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:03,637
Sir, trust me.

501
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,797
I've heard a lot of cases about them.

502
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,163
They're very unprofessional.

503
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:08,333
They can't be trusted.

504
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,202
But I've been sent the information that.

505
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,237
...Fateh Singh is their best officer.

506
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,840
Sir, the information could be false.

507
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,809
Now, this dacoit Shampy doesn't look like a smuggler.

508
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,478
He looks like an application for mafia.

509
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,913
Look, Singh, no matter what you think"

510
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,582
...you'll have to solve this case..

511
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,251
...along with that officer from the Punjab Police.

512
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,753
You're the only one who's Punjabi here.

513
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,921
Sir, you're Punjabi too.

514
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:34,192
Fifty percent. I'm the boss here.

515
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,561
End of conversation.

516
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:53,745
Right, sir.

517
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,957
Attention, please.

518
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:57,582
Requesting passenger Gary Johnson..'

519
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,626
...to report to baggage counter.'

520
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:14,099
The one with beautiful eyes.

521
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,636
The one with beautiful eyes.

522
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,740
I have heard that your eyes..

523
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,690
...are requested to proceed to gate number 6 for boarding.

524
00:22:25,716 --> 00:22:26,678
Thank you.'

525
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,980
Fateh Singh?

526
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,952
Officers stand with such boards to welcome big ministers.

527
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,821
This is happening for me today?

528
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,725
God, You've made me happy today.

529
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,927
Mr. Fateh Singh?

530
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,788
Amazing! Give this to me, girl.

531
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:46,264
I'll frame it.

532
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,377
What the hell are you doing?

533
00:22:47,403 --> 00:22:47,933
Who are you?

534
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:48,930
Talk with respect, girl.

535
00:22:48,956 --> 00:22:50,135
Don't talk to me like that.

536
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,671
I'm Fateh Singh, almost an inspector from the Punjab Police.

537
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,705
You're Fateh Singh?

538
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,941
Yes. And this is my deputy red label.

539
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,376
Red label? - Yes.

540
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,345
When I hit someone with this, it creates such a red mark on his face..

541
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,547
...that he becomes the property of the Punjab Police.

542
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,011
Anyway, forget about the Punjab Police.

543
00:23:04,037 --> 00:23:04,950
You won't understand it.

544
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,485
Do one thing, dear. Here's Rs. 5.

545
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,786
Go buy a chocolate for yourself.

546
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:08,408
And go back to school.

547
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:09,454
The teacher must be looking for you.

548
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,355
Give this to me.

549
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,300
Chocolate?
Teacher?

550
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:12,891
What nonsense are you talking?

551
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,022
Dear, it doesn't look nice.

552
00:23:14,048 --> 00:23:14,860
Talk with respect.

553
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,128
Which school do you study in?

554
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,696
How many times have you failed in the 12th standard?
Tell me.

555
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:18,430
What school?

556
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,933
I'm an officer of the Vancouver Police Department, idiot.

557
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,668
You're a policewoman!

558
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,771
Policewoman?
- Lady police?

559
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,439
Why have you worn this blue color uniform?

560
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,907
Why haven't you worn khaki?

561
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,510
This is the police uniform in Canada.

562
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,911
Blue color?

563
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,880
The khaki uniform looks powerful.

564
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,248
Over there, people don't accept letters..

565
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,582
...from postmen wearing khaki uniform..

566
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,718
...fearing that it could be a warrant.

567
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,986
Seeing your blue uniform,

568
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,855
people might consider you a school girl and not even be scared of you.

569
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,425
The police here are not to scare people, but to help them.

570
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,893
If the common people don't get scared of the police..

571
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,327
"Then how will hooligans be scared?

572
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,100
The foreign government is crazy.

573
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:52,264
They have no sense.

574
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,666
If your speech is over, then can we go?

575
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,185
Yes, let's go.

576
00:23:55,211 --> 00:23:56,668
I don't want to chat with you either.

577
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,521
Where's the vehicle of the Punjab Police?

578
00:23:58,547 --> 00:23:59,271
- In the parking.

579
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,505
In the parking?

580
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:05,451
The weather seems naughty today"

581
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,079
- Hey! This way.

582
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,299
Why have you parked it so far?

583
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:10,682
You should have brought it here.

584
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:11,583
It's not allowed.

585
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,951
Why are the police not allowed?

586
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,520
If it has the red siren, you can park it even on the moon.

587
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,524
Six dollars.'

588
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:24,362
'Thank you.'

589
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:28,366
Talk to the government and ask them
to change the color of your uniform.

590
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,335
'10 dollars.'

591
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,871
I'm a policeman.

592
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,574
'10 dollars.'
- Madam, I said I'm a policeman.

593
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,175
Hold on. I am paying.

594
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,677
'10 dollars.'

595
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,302
I said I'm a policeman.

596
00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:40,145
Why are you asking for money?

597
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,615
'Thank you.'

598
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,083
That's how these people are.

599
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:45,479
Let's go.

600
00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:46,376
Let's go. Let's go.

601
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,018
- Oh, my God!

602
00:24:47,018 --> 00:25:00,999
Bye.

603
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,202
This is your guesthouse.

604
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:09,541
Wow! Wonderful!

605
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,345
If the Punjab Police wasn't so
strict, I would have called you in.

606
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,513
Don't feel bad.

607
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,112
It's okay.

608
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,848
I'll pacify myself. - Okay.

609
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,517
Please be ready at 10 am tomorrow.

610
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,919
We have to go to the police station and meet the chief.

611
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,079
Okay. No problem.

612
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,124
Thank you.

613
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,792
Thank you.

614
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,813
It's really not a problem.

615
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:29,794
- No, I must thank you.

616
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,130
You came to drop me so far.

617
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,598
Okay. My hand..

618
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,216
It's your hand.

619
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,245
I'm not taking it along.

620
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:35,767
- Thank you.

621
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,803
At 10 am. -All right. Bye.

622
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:46,044
Go carefully.

623
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,581
Deputy, you're slipping on seeing a constable.

624
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,417
Punjab Police, concentrate on your work, okay?

625
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,552
Silly BOY-

626
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,923
Inspector, my dear son has missed his flight already.

627
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:04,129
If his visa expires too, then Mr. Chawla will suffer a very big loss.

628
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,530
He won't be able to bear the shock.

629
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,566
Who's Chawla now?

630
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,193
I'm Mr. Chawla.

631
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:12,771
Proprietor, Chawla Fish Centre.

632
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:17,108
Inspector, if you ever come to Hoshiyarpur..

633
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,978
...do try the fish-tikka at our restaurant.

634
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:26,418
I guarantee you that you will surely leave a tip of at least Rs. 11.

635
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,920
We'll try your fish-tikka some other time.

636
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,957
You taste the PT at our police station today.

637
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,725
What's PT?

638
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,960
Physical Torture.

639
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,692
Is that a new dish?

640
00:26:35,718 --> 00:26:36,962
Let me write the recipe. - Yes.

641
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,263
Do you want to taste it?

642
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,665
No. Let it be.

643
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,567
I'm a vegetarian.

644
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,736
I want to make a request.
- Tell me.

645
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,905
Please release my dear son.

646
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:47,790
I'll release him.

647
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,040
It'll cost Rs. 20,000.

648
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,077
Rs. 20,000?

649
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,447
My dear son is of four square feet in total.

650
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,884
This means you're charging Rs. 5000 per square feet?

651
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,287
Do you want to get your dear son released or buy a plot?

652
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,323
Inspector, it's a rule in business.

653
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,826
You see the goods first and then pay.

654
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,128
What's my dear son?

655
00:27:10,154 --> 00:27:12,430
A bunch of bones.

656
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,343
All right, then.

657
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:15,567
Let's finalize the deal in Rs. 15,000.

658
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:19,504
One ton AC costs Rs. 15,000.

659
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,413
My dear son is only 51 kgs.

660
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,675
You can weigh him if you want.

661
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,910
Do I have a weighing scale here to weigh him?

662
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,334
Sir, why do you get angry?

663
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,783
Fix a good deal with your customer.

664
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:32,802
Fix a deal with my customer?

665
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:33,785
Am I a salesman of veils?

666
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:34,511
Okay, fine.

667
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:36,955
Let's finalize something in between.

668
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,091
Take Rs. 1100 and end this issue.

669
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,191
End this issue.

670
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,727
Mr. Chawla doesn't have any more strength.

671
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,663
You're bargaining with Inspector Joginder?

672
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,632
Think about it.

673
00:27:45,658 --> 00:27:48,667
The date of the visa expiry is getting closer.

674
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,826
Please agree, Inspector.

675
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:50,502
Please agree.

676
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:54,005
All right. Don't tell anyone about this outside.
- Okay.

677
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,507
You'll spoil my rate.
- Okay.

678
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,142
1100 is final now?
- Final.

679
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,210
Bring his dear son.

680
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,780
Will you accept cash or should I pay by cheque?

681
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,715
Now don't deduct TDS from this too.

682
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,250
Just be a man and pay Rs. 1100..

683
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,687
...or else I'll arrest both, the father and the son.

684
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:16,061
Give it fast.

685
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,295
Take it.

686
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,731
Can't you give it to me properly?

687
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,733
It's our rule.

688
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,814
We've always taken.

689
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,004
We've never given.

690
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,473
Here you go, sir.

691
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:32,010
My dear son! - Father!

692
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,714
He..

693
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,150
You had to pay so much money for me!

694
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,854
Love you, father!

695
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,289
Stop crying!

696
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,791
Your kisses will ruin the atmosphere of my police station.

697
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,694
Get out of here!

698
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:54,799
Respected sir, please give your dear son his passport back.

699
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,660
I'll give you your passport back.

700
00:28:56,686 --> 00:28:58,069
Bring Rs. 50,000 first.

701
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,338
50,000! - Yes.

702
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,640
But why?

703
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,672
It's a rule in business.

704
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:05,477
You see the goods first and then pay.

705
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,812
People charge Rs. 30 lakhs for the Canada visa.

706
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,447
I've only asked for 50,000.

707
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,249
Get out!

708
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,319
You can't betray your dear son like that.

709
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,888
If your dear son doesn't go to Canada..

710
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:20,592
...then even you will never get a ticket to any place.

711
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,039
This is your dear son's curse!

712
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:24,262
Curse! Curse!

713
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,132
I will shoot your curse right away.

714
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:32,237
Get out!

715
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,639
Even their money stinks of fish.

716
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:35,414
Excuse me.

717
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,808
- What is it now?

718
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,010
Do you have Rs. 50?
- Why?

719
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,081
We need to get petrol filled in our vehicle?
- You..

720
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:43,858
Come on, son!

721
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,950
Come on!
- Let's go, father. Bye!

722
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,354
I wonder where they've come from.

723
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,522
Hello.
- Hello, sir.

724
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:51,923
Fateh Singh reporting.

725
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:52,782
Yes, Fateh Singh.

726
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:53,792
What's the report?

727
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,010
It's very good, sir.

728
00:29:55,036 --> 00:29:56,227
Our scheme worked.

729
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,896
The English government has kept me like a son-in-law.

730
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,583
What a guesthouse!

731
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:01,833
Four rooms, a kitchen"

732
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,203
Sir, there's a kitchen too.

733
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:10,175
Kitchen.. There's a fridge in the kitchen and liquor in the fridge.

734
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:14,379
I am afraid tomorrow a few ministers may come to massage my legs.

735
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,315
Stop having fun and quickly tell me how the work's going.

736
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,922
I still have to do it, sir.

737
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:20,885
A lady inspector is my partner.

738
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,854
I will have to keep her away from me first.

739
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,856
Otherwise she will make me keep looking for Shampy dacoit.

740
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:28,326
Oh, gosh!
- Really, Fateh Singh, it's very difficult to get you off the back.

741
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,094
Sir, what you say is right.

742
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,030
Girls find it difficult to stay away from me.

743
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,950
But don't worry, sir.

744
00:30:32,976 --> 00:30:34,833
I'll try my best to keep her away from me.

745
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,535
Because of people like you that the Punjab Police has such a good reputation.

746
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,870
Sir, just wait and watch.

747
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,305
If this lady inspector stays away from me..

748
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,140
...I'll bring the DC's daughter back to Punjab in just two days.

749
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,643
Seeing your face, the cattle do not come outside the shed.

750
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,546
How will you entice the DC's daughter and bring her to Punjab?

751
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:52,250
Sir, you've solved my problem.
- How?

752
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,185
Sir, I was fed up thinking since yesterday.

753
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,421
...as to how I'll convince the DC's daughter.

754
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,890
Now I understood that I won't convince her, but entice her.

755
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,184
Sir, please hang up now.

756
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,126
I'll get back to my mission. Okay?

757
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:06,231
I think I should keep my mouth shut.

758
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,833
He takes ideas from me.

759
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,803
Come on, Fateh Singh, get ready now.

760
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:16,140
If things don't work out, then your beauty could act as a weapon.

761
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,309
Okay?

762
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,445
What did you say?

763
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:25,250
No, say it again.

764
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,619
You'll get me in trouble someday, silly.

765
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:40,832
I'm telling you.

766
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,235
I want to become the
hanging of your turban.

767
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:49,574
I feel like it, Inspector.

768
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,343
I want to become the
hanging of your turban.

769
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,246
I feel like it, Inspector.

770
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,149
Good morning. Looking good.

771
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,117
Why are you late?

772
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,449
I've been waiting since half an hour.

773
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:02,520
Where were you?

774
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,900
You've become quite frank.

775
00:32:03,926 --> 00:32:05,757
You're being so informal with me.

776
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,293
I've understood that you're not worth respecting.

777
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,494
You're very ill-mannered.

778
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,996
Forget saluting your senior officer,
you're arguing with me instead.

779
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,743
Senior officer? You?

780
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:14,966
- Yes. - How?

781
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,698
You're constable P. Singh.
A lady constable.

782
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:17,468
Did you understand?

783
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,715
You're not a DC either.

784
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:20,071
You're a constable too.

785
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:20,779
I was a constable.

786
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,273
When I go back, I'll be an inspector.

787
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,441
As soon as I return, the orders will be passed.

788
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,043
That's why I'm a senior officer. Okay?

789
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:25,835
Come on, salute me.

790
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:26,794
It doesn't look nice.

791
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,545
Come on. Come on.

792
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,514
Forget saluting you, I won't even slap you.

793
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,449
If you slap me, won't I flail you?

794
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,251
Flail? What the heck is that?

795
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,687
What will you do after knowing, constable?

796
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,888
Keep quiet and sit in the car.

797
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,089
My chief is waiting for you.

798
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,490
I too will complain to your chief that their constable.

799
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,792
"Doesn't know how to talk with respect.

800
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,926
You learn to respect others first.

801
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,162
This is not your police station. It's the Vancouver Police Department.

802
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:45,330
Your rudeness won't work here.

803
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,832
You'll have to talk to the chief properly.

804
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:52,570
The Punjab Police can make anyone speak their language.

805
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:58,977
So, how are you, Fateh Singh?

806
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,547
So, doesn't Mr. Paul speak our language so well?

807
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,960
It's not that.

808
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:06,484
My father is a Punjabi.

809
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,720
That's why I'm fifty percent Punjabi.

810
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,556
You just need one peg to make water a drink.

811
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:16,894
Even if you were one percent Punjabi, you would have been a Punjabi.

812
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,162
Yes, Mark?

813
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,065
Chief, he hasn't confessed yet.

814
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,235
You better make him confess before his lawyers get here.

815
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,005
Okay, I'll try.
- Thank you.

816
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,972
What's the problem, chief?

817
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:32,610
The car thief that we arrested hasn't confessed yet.

818
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:37,482
His lawyer will be here in awhile and easily get him bailed out.

819
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:41,152
That's why, it's very important to make him confess.

820
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:42,353
Can l try, Mr. Paul?

821
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,190
You?
Fateh Singh, do you want to interrogate him?

822
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,367
Yes. - No, chief.
We can't allow that.

823
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,627
It's against the law.

824
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:53,331
I agree that it's against the law, but he hasn't followed the law either.

825
00:33:53,331 --> 00:34:00,204
He is a car thief, after all.

826
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,207
Like I said, you're not going to get anything without a lawyer.

827
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,776
Come on.
 The Punjab Police are here. Get out.

828
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,120
He's all yours.

829
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:07,912
- Come on. Get out.

830
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,915
They've seated him on the chair, as if he's a groom.

831
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:13,418
You seat a decent person on the chair and he becomes a thief.

832
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,607
These crazy people have seated a thief.

833
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:16,154
Get up!

834
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,955
Who are you? - Fateh Singh..

835
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,724
"Almost an inspector from the Punjab Police.

836
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,958
Who Fateh Singh?

837
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:23,194
- Your father. Your father.

838
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:24,829
I can make a dumb man talk.

839
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:28,533
I've heard that you're not confessing.

840
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,567
No!

841
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,270
Say that you have stolen!

842
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,839
Say that you have stolen!

843
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:38,065
No! Please!

844
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:40,411
Please!

845
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,131
I am a thief!

846
00:34:42,157 --> 00:34:44,248
I have stolen!

847
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,187
Just save me from the butcher!

848
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:47,285
Please! - What?

849
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,421
So, Mr. Paul, he finally confessed.

850
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,591
Hey! What have you done?
- I stole.

851
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,592
I stole.

852
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,794
All foreigners are thieves in Canada.

853
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,629
Do you want anyone else to confess?

854
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,146
Thank you, Fateh Singh.

855
00:35:00,172 --> 00:35:01,532
Job very well done.

856
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,801
Take this guy away.

857
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:06,003
Get going.
- Let's go.

858
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,539
Move it. Get lost, idiot!

859
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,848
Fateh, tell me something.

860
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,209
How did you do all this?

861
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:11,881
It's very easy.

862
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:12,777
Fateh's thrashings.

863
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,672
Fateh's thrashings?

864
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:15,179
- It's very popular in Punjab.

865
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,814
I've solved many cases this way.

866
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:21,619
I didn't know that the Punjab Police's techniques would be so useful.

867
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,056
What do I tell you, brother?

868
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:24,288
We don't have any ego.

869
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,823
So, Fateh, do one thing.

870
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:27,692
Teach all these techniques to my officers also.

871
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,060
No problem.
I'll teach them.

872
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,962
The Punjab Police are always ready for service.

873
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,912
All right, then.

874
00:35:31,938 --> 00:35:33,397
I'll tell my officers..

875
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,333
"That Fateh will give a lecture.
- Okay.

876
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,068
Now I must take a leave.

877
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,571
Singh, take good care of him.

878
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,374
He's a special guy.

879
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,143
Special guy.

880
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,513
All right, then, Mr. Paul. Bye.

881
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:53,551
So, please take good care of me.

882
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,886
Should we start working on the case?

883
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,287
We've already wasted a lot of time.

884
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,256
No.

885
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,425
It's Punjab Police's lunchtime.

886
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:07,865
Follow me.

887
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,379
You go in and order.

888
00:36:09,405 --> 00:36:10,968
I'll be right back.

889
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:11,636
Okay.

890
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,005
Okay?

891
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,541
I'm an innocent child.

892
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,476
I'm an officer of the nation.

893
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,812
Hey, handsome! What's up?

894
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,014
No.
- Hello.

895
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:23,396
What is it?

896
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:23,831
- Come soon.

897
00:36:23,857 --> 00:36:24,682
I'll get bored inside.

898
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,650
Piss off!

899
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,119
Piss off you too. - Go!

900
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,822
Come. Okay, I'll order.

901
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,463
Hello. No, not you.

902
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:36,227
It's that officer from Punjab.

903
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:41,132
He's so irritating.

904
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,094
Where were you?

905
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,634
What took you so long?

906
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,503
It was an important phone call.

907
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:47,238
Okay, now order whatever you want to eat.

908
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,007
What?
You mean you've ordered all of this for yourself?

909
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,377
All of this?
This is not much.

910
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,613
If you eat so much, you'll get fat.

911
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,583
I want to get fat, but I'm unable to.

912
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,451
But why?
The police must be fit.

913
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,273
Are you crazy?

914
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:03,387
We are recognized by our stomachs.

915
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,722
The inspector is 36 inches.

916
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,224
The DSP is 36 inches.

917
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,459
The SP is 40 inches and the DIG is 45 inches.

918
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,528
That's why you all can't run after thieves.

919
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,397
Why do we need to run after thieves?

920
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,732
Why have I kept deputy with me?

921
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,467
I have not kept it to move wires away.

922
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,969
I just throw it at the culprit from far.

923
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,004
Wherever it hits, it makes a red stamp.

924
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,807
Love you.
- You also make false cases on the thief.

925
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,643
Whether the case is true or false, a thief remains a thief.

926
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,379
If we make false cases of him, it improves his reputation.

927
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,943
People call him a big thief.

928
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:30,948
Isn't it? Crazy.

929
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,398
Hey, ma'am.
Can I get you anything?

930
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:33,351
We're about to close.

931
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,919
I'm fine. Thanks.
- Great.

932
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,616
All right, here's your bill, sir.

933
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:38,055
- Have you lost your mind!

934
00:37:38,055 --> 00:37:39,323
You're asking the Punjab Police to pay!

935
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,324
What the hell are you doing!

936
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,892
He's crazy.
- You're crazy.

937
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:42,727
He's crazy.

938
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,829
My God!

939
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:45,306
Are you mad?

940
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:46,897
He wanted to file a case against you.

941
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,099
I convinced him with great difficulty.

942
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,467
Why did you slap him?

943
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,635
These are contemporary times.

944
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,204
I gave him the opportunity to serve me and he was asking for money.

945
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,126
This is Canada.

946
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:55,539
You have to pay here.

947
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,441
Your Canada is so greedy.

948
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,709
The people in our country are so rich.

949
00:37:58,709 --> 00:37:59,697
You can eat as much as you want to.

950
00:37:59,723 --> 00:38:00,544
No one ever asked for money.

951
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:04,763
God! You'll never change.

952
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,450
Nothing.

953
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,052
Back off! What are you doing?

954
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:11,522
Give me the opportunity to match shoulders with you.

955
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,958
Are you really this dumb or are you trying to flirt with me?

956
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,026
Flirt?

957
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,295
I can't flirt with you even if I want to.

958
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,363
Our government doesn't allow a male police officer..

959
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,232
...and a female police officer to have a fling.

960
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,667
Fling? What do you mean?

961
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,325
That what girls and boys do.

962
00:38:25,351 --> 00:38:28,172
They sit in the garden and..

963
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:28,806
Get lost!

964
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,141
I was just trying to explain to you.

965
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,142
-I understand everything.

966
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,277
If you want to work with me, then don't try to get close to me.

967
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:36,314
You're worse than what I had heard about the Punjab Police.

968
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,615
Idiot!

969
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,817
Hey!

970
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:45,990
There is no comparison of the Punjab Police.

971
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,758
Everyone is aware.

972
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,694
The Punjab Police
belong to Sardars.

973
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,429
To Sardars. To Sardars.

974
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,364
Everyone is aware.

975
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,232

976
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,068
Everyone is aware.

977
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,903
The Punjab Police
belong to Sardars.

978
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,671
We make them apologize..

979
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,506
We make them apologize..

980
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,375
We make them apologize.

981
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,144
This is our status.

982
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,680
Our status. Our status.

983
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,816
Everyone is aware.

984
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,617
The Punjab Police
belong to Sardars.

985
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,519

00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,926
The Punjab Police

989
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:25,596
To Sardars. To Sardars.

990
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:29,333
To Sardars. To Sardars.

991
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,370
To Sardars. To Sardars.

992
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,719
You beat people.

993
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:35,573
You show your stick.

994
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:40,344
You make false cases.

995
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:45,516
Hey! The Punjab Police
don't make cases, but people.

996
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,051
People.

997
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,788
We look for a good opportunity.

998
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:54,492
...and then thrash them.

999
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:58,362
We look for a good opportunity
and then thrash them.

1000
00:39:58,362 --> 00:39:59,883
We don't spare thieves.

1001
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:01,866
We let the innocent ones go.

1002
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,501
You don't know, baby.

1003
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,636
If they don't listen with love..

1004
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,204
Don't listen"

1005
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:11,575
If they don't listen with love,
we have to beat them.

1006
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,510
I don't care.

1007
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,612
Everyone is aware.

00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,447

To Sardars. To Sardars.

1014
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,494
To Sardars. To Sardars.

1015
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,163
Oh. my God!

1016
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:36,434
To Sardars. To Sardars.

1017
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,303
Shut up!

1018
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:42,440
Your reputation is very bad.

1019
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,942
You accept bribe in the name of donation.

1020
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,779
Hey! The Punjab Police don't take money.

1021
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,116
The Punjab Police take love.

1022
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,617
Take love.

1023
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,354
We have God's blessings.

1024
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:00,925
We don't cheat.

1025
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:03,113
We have God's blessings.

1026
00:41:03,139 --> 00:41:04,662
We don't cheat.

1027
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,023
We battle against death.

1028
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,499
We're tigers.

1029
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,967
We're tigers.

1030
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,836
They shine from far..

1031
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,671
They shine from far..

1032
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:19,009
The stars on our
shoulders shine from far.

1033
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,045

The Punjab Police

1037
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:31,222
To Sardars. To Sardars.

1038
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,291
To Sardars. To Sardars.

1039
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,082
What do I tell you?

1040
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:39,663
The Punjab Police are emotional too.

1041
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,199
Back off! Get lost!

1042
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:57,414
Pushing off the Punjab Police!

1043
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:05,956
Oh, no!

1044
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,591
She'll be here any minute.

1045
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,960
Sometimes when she has too many customers, she gets late.

1046
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,748
But.. - It's okay, darling.

1047
00:42:11,774 --> 00:42:14,331
Even my Sandy is like that.
- Mother.

1048
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,300
Darling, what's this?

1049
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,702
She's my mother.

1050
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,942
She's been like that for many years.

1051
00:42:19,968 --> 00:42:20,863
She sleeps all the time.

1052
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,107
That's why I wake her up in between and check, you know.

1053
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,348
Okay. Okay. I got it.

1054
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:25,175
- Hi, mother.

1055
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,043
Hi, dear.

1056
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,845
Come. Come.

1057
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,680
Dear, this is aunt Neelam.

1058
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,915
Hi. - Hi!

1059
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:34,385
And that's her son, Sandy.

1060
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,221
Hey.

1061
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,790
Oh, you naughty boy!

1062
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:45,195
Dear, he wants to know whether your mole is natural or artificial.

1063
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,232
It's natural.

1064
00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:50,334
But why?

1065
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:54,038
Oh, you naughty, naughty boy!

1066
00:42:54,038 --> 00:43:00,660
Dear, do you know the snake dance?

1067
00:43:00,686 --> 00:43:02,413
- What?

1068
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,848
Your mother had called us, you witch!

1069
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:07,217
Or else he has several other proposals.

1070
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,752
Get lost!

1071
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,256
She is so egoistic as if she is a police officer!

1072
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,198
Let's go, son.

1073
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:13,871
Let's go.

1074
00:43:13,897 --> 00:43:15,743
We'll talk to Sridevi, son.

1075
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:16,427
Let's go.

1076
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,463
Dear, so what if he likes Sridevi?

1077
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,932
You should have said that you know the snake dance.

1078
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,336
Mother, for the last time, I won't marry a Punjabi boy.

1079
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,972
Why? What's the problem in Punjabi boys?

1080
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:30,874
Punjabi boys are idiots and ill-mannered.

1081
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,277
I've already seen a sample outside and at home today.

1082
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,110
It's never going to happen, mother.

1083
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:37,081
Good night.

1084
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,551
If you're stubborn, then I'm your mother.

1085
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:45,889
You will marry a Punjabi boy.

1086
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:46,893
Okay, don't worry.

1087
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:49,460
I'll be there in five minutes.
Don't worry.

1088
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,528
Manager?
- Sir, the manager is over there.

1089
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,496
Thank you.

1090
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,198
Hello, manager.

1091
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,100
Hello.
- Yes, tell me.

1092
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,636
We want to talk to you about something very important.

1093
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,204
Please come tomorrow.

1094
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:00,846
I'm in a hurry.

1095
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,172
There's an emergency at home.

1096
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:05,042
Respected sir, customers are like God.

1097
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,544
You can't go without listening to God.

1098
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,079
Okay, sit. Tell me quickly.

1099
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,148
Thank you. - Thank you.

1100
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,748
We want to tell you that.

1101
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:16,453
we want a very big loan.

1102
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,755
Very, very big. - Yes.

1103
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:18,789
Is it? - Yes.

1104
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,391
How much loan do you want?

1105
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,460
Rs. 50,000. - What?

1106
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,696
Yes. We want to give someone a bribe.

1107
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:26,511
What nonsense!

1108
00:44:26,537 --> 00:44:28,432
We don't lend money for bribes.

1109
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,567
What are you saying, Mr. Manager?

1110
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:34,405
If you can give a loan to make houses and for cars..

1111
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,173
"Then why not for bribes?

1112
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:41,245
After all, bribe is also a very big need in life.

1113
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:42,598
You're wasting my time.

1114
00:44:42,624 --> 00:44:43,480
Please leave.

1115
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,251
Manager, we won't leave unless we get a loan.

1116
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,821
My brother is in the ICU, battling between life and death.

1117
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,656
And you're concerned about your loan of 50,000?

1118
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:54,825
Excuse me, Mr. Manager.

1119
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:59,897
If we wanted a loan of Rs. 50 lakhs,
your brother would have gotten well.

1120
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,165
What nonsense are you talking!

1121
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,870
It's not nonsense.

1122
00:45:02,896 --> 00:45:04,101
It's a fact.

1123
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,936
A dead person is worth a penny.

1124
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:10,140
And you're leaving customers worth 50,000 for the sake of a penny?

1125
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,809
Shame on you. Shame on you.

1126
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:12,643
Shut up!

1127
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,012
He slapped your dear son once!

1128
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,881
He slapped your dear son twice!

1129
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:24,021
Manager, you may slap him one more time, but please give us a loan.

1130
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,657
He slapped your dear son thrice!

1131
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:29,760
Strange.
He agreed about slapping you..

1132
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:43,841
"But he didn't agree to give the loan.

1133
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:44,533
What's the matter?

1134
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:45,609
Why are you not ready yet?

1135
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,265
It's my fault.

1136
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:50,814
You had told me to eat less.

1137
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:51,849
But what happened?

1138
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,124
You never know these things.

1139
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,887
I don't understand what's wrong.

1140
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,356
I've done 8-10 rounds since morning.

1141
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:02,025
I didn't find any evidence at the crime scene.

1142
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:05,763
Just think that the Punjab Police are not well today.

1143
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,730
What do you mean?

1144
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,533
Everything is opened.

1145
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:12,169
Today I've understood the importance of control in life.

1146
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,270
What nonsense are you talking?

1147
00:46:13,296 --> 00:46:14,004
What has happened?

1148
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,773
My stomach is in a very bad shape.

1149
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,588
I have a stomachache.

1150
00:46:16,614 --> 00:46:17,908
You know what that means, right?

1151
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:18,876
No, I don't.

1152
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:22,246
That light feeling..

1153
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,536
Touch my stomach and see.

1154
00:46:23,562 --> 00:46:25,549
Everything" - No, wait. I understood.

1155
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,300
You rest today.

1156
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:27,551
I'll investigate alone.

1157
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,052
But my duty is calling out to me.

1158
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,722
No, you please listen to your stomach's call.

1159
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:32,456
Take care.

1160
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,996
I'll come with the bucket along.

1161
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:37,060
- Just" You.. Stay here.

1162
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,429
Constable!

1163
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,733
Please wait!

1164
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,068
Let me experience the light feelings.

1165
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:49,907
The light feelings.

1166
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:53,210
No, tell the truth.

1167
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,412
You'll get someone in trouble, idiot.

1168
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:58,749
I don't think the DC's daughter will be able to get away today.

1169
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:02,019
I'm worried that she might fall for me as soon as she sees me.

1170
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:06,557
Let's see. It's a compromise of the Punjab Police.

1171
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:14,164
Punjab Police, concentrate on your work.

1172
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:19,002
Let's go.

1173
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,504
I won't go.

1174
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,172
You're Punjabi?

1175
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,574
Still you're refusing your Punjabi brother?

1176
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,609
Don't you dare call me your brother!

1177
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,412
An Indian and a Pakistani can never be brothers!

1178
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,013
This is like the Wagha Border.

1179
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,417
No one can come on this side or go on that side. Got it?

1180
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,553
I see. You're Pakistani.

1181
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:39,022
That's why you started firing straightaway, instead of talking.

1182
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,090
Don't consider me your brother if you don't want to.

1183
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,358
I don't want to make you my real brother either.

1184
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,427
Just take me to my destination and take your money.
That's it.

1185
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,229
I don't want your money.

1186
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:45,914
Are you crazy?

1187
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,165
We've never paid an Indian any money before..

1188
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:49,933
...and you're refusing dollars?

1189
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,635
You don't get such opportunities everyday.

1190
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:52,469
You're crazy.

1191
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,279
You are our neighbor.

1192
00:47:53,305 --> 00:47:54,204
That's why I told you.

1193
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,573
After all, only an Indian helps a Pakistani in an unknown country.

1194
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,375
I know people like you.

1195
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:02,179
People like you ring the bells of neighbors and run away.

1196
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,181
You say you'll help me.

1197
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,720
No, no, no. Don't insult me.

1198
00:48:05,746 --> 00:48:06,984
It doesn't look nice.

1199
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,685
Because if I start, I won't stop.

1200
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,820
If the Punjab Police's friendship is bad..

1201
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,256
...then their animosity is worse than anything.

1202
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,725
I've tolerated the Pakistani police.

1203
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,993
What's the Punjab Police in front of them?

1204
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,461
Tell me. What are the Punjab Police? Tell me.

1205
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,962
Really? Then listen.

1206
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:19,516
You tell us.

1207
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:20,764
Look at yourselves first.

1208
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,466
You can't see others prosper.

1209
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,600
You can't afford to buy cars.

1210
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,369
So you steal others' cars at night and escape.

1211
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,404
You.. - Hey! Listen to me.

1212
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,839
You can't see others prosper.

1213
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,407
You see others and get an AC fixed in your house.

1214
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,377
First get electricity at least.

1215
00:48:31,403 --> 00:48:32,409
You can get the AC fixed later.

1216
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,912
You..
- Hey! Who says that a Sardar can't cross the border?

1217
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:35,354
Here you go.

1218
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,313
I've crossed the border.

1219
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:37,714
Do what you can!

1220
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:38,496
Now tell me!

1221
00:48:38,522 --> 00:48:39,082
Tell me!

1222
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,183
You people.. - Hey!

1223
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,119
The Punjab Police don't have the time to listen to your nonsense!

1224
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,357
Take your cab away.

1225
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:44,855
I have to go on duty.

1226
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,890
There are many other cabs.

1227
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,725
Trying to act smart in his cab.

1228
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:53,784
Don't come in front of me again!

1229
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,365
Cartoon!

1230
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,068
Yes. We have you for 5 oé€""clock.

1231
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,002
Great. See you then.

1232
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,537
Hello.

1233
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,973
Yes? - Where is Pooja?

1234
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,008
Pooja? Who?

1235
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:10,781
You know.. Where's the slim,
fair, beautiful, Punjabi girl?

1236
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,316
Owner.. Owner.

1237
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:13,884
Oh, the owner. - Owner. Owner.

1238
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,335
Yes, the owner's Punjabi.

1239
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:16,553
Let me go call her.

1240
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:20,157
Who says you don't know English?

1241
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,960
God, Fateh Singh has shown a little courage.

1242
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,294
The rest is Your duty.

1243
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,663
The girl shouldn't be so posh that I'm unable to impress her.

1244
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,365
Please take care of that.

1245
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:31,335
Yes? Who are you?

1246
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:34,304
What do you want?

1247
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,472
God, I had said she shouldn't be posh..

1248
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,040
"But she should have at least been a girl.

1249
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,209
First understand what I'm saying and then take an action.

1250
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:40,610
You are very naughty.

1251
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,479
You always do this to me.

1252
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,148
Hello? What are you chanting?

1253
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,719
Speak up.

1254
00:49:46,745 --> 00:49:49,686
What do you want?

1255
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,054
Are you Pooja?

1256
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,812
Why do you want to know the name?

1257
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:54,091
Tell me what you want.

1258
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:58,261
L.. I.. I..

1259
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,630
I see.

1260
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,965
You want to get your manicure done.

1261
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:02,933
Yes, I want to get it done.

1262
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:07,637
Come. Sit over there. - Okay.

1263
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:08,805
Give me your hand.

1264
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:09,940
Are you going to administer an injection?

1265
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,641
No, I will cut it. -What?

1266
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,844
Give me your hand.

1267
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,401
No, I can't do this.

1268
00:50:15,427 --> 00:50:17,114
You sit. I'll stand.

1269
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,782
If sir comes to know, then he'll get angry.

1270
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:20,884
Whose sir? - God.

1271
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:21,373
What will He say?

1272
00:50:21,399 --> 00:50:22,753
That the girl was standing while I was sitting.

1273
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:26,089
It doesn't look nice.
You sit.

1274
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,158
Sit.

1275
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,861
Wow! You're such a gentleman.

1276
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,530
Punjabis become gentlemen on seeing a beautiful girl.

1277
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,332
Beautiful girl?

1278
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,933
Who?
- You. Who else?

1279
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,001
I? - Yes.

1280
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,269
Beautiful? - Yes.

1281
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,838
No. Everyone calls me fat.

1282
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:42,917
They're jealous of you.

1283
00:50:42,943 --> 00:50:44,841
God has given you such a nice physique.

1284
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,210
If I had such a physique, I would have been a DIG.

1285
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,147
Don't lie. You'll be doomed.

1286
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,816
I'm not lying. If you were not in the beauty parlor..

1287
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,719
...then this would have been just a parlor without beauty.

1288
00:50:55,719 --> 00:51:00,924
You're a mountain of beauty.

1289
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,260
You Punjabi boys!

1290
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,963
Whenever you see a beautiful girl, you run after her.

1291
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:07,990
We can't help it.

1292
00:51:08,016 --> 00:51:09,199
That's our nature.

1293
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,667
You liar.

1294
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:18,341
You're beautiful.

1295
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:22,779
Fateh, it took very long, but I managed to entice the fatso.

1296
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:25,282
Let's go.

1297
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,617
Brother, you!
- You?

1298
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:28,779
One minute..
- Keep quiet.

1299
00:51:28,805 --> 00:51:30,120
Don't talk.
I'm telling you.

1300
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,755
If you keep quiet, then your honor will remain intact.

1301
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,190
...and I'll get down from the cab with respect too.

1302
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,216
Listen to me.

1303
00:51:34,242 --> 00:51:38,161
I won't let you go anywhere, brother.
- Brother.

1304
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,030
Have you lost your mind?

1305
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:44,134
Indians and Pakistanis are brothers, after all, brother.

1306
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,735
You're getting very emotional.

1307
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:46,899
What are you drinking?

1308
00:51:46,925 --> 00:51:47,904
- English liquor.

1309
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,239
Wonderful!

1310
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,209
The British separated us and the English liquor is bringing us closer.

1311
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,155
Yes. - Give me.

1312
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:55,679
I am not feeling the same love for you.

1313
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,893
You may drink as much as you want.

1314
00:51:57,919 --> 00:51:59,716
You're my younger brother.

1315
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,718
But remember one thing.

1316
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,921
No matter where you go, I'll drop you there.

1317
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,289
That too free of cost.

1318
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:11,328
Because in an unknown country, only
a Pakistani can help an Indian.

1319
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,462
If that's the matter. - Yes.

1320
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,598
Then you may go to any part of the world..

1321
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,800
"But the Punjab Police will never fine you.
- Really?

1322
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,934
Because after all, in an unknown country"

1323
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,871
...even an Indian helps a Pakistani.

1324
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:21,733
Wherever I go?

1325
00:52:21,759 --> 00:52:23,273
- Go wherever you want.

1326
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,941
Even if I cross the Wagha Border?

1327
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,276
Just come, brother.

1328
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:26,950
I've come, brother.

1329
00:52:26,976 --> 00:52:27,978
You just had to command me.

1330
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,681
Careful.
The wall of Wagha will break.

1331
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:32,356
You also drink.

1332
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,750
- No, no, brother. You first.

1333
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:42,692
No. - You first. - Have it!

1334
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,060
Hello!

1335
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,862
Yes? How are you feeling today?

1336
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:51,067
lam..

1337
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,303
What?

1338
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:56,461
One minute.

1339
00:52:56,487 --> 00:53:02,290
I'll be right back.

1340
00:53:02,316 --> 00:53:05,649
-What the"

1341
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:11,154
I was saying that.

1342
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:25,202
L.. I did not sit down? - God!

1343
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,803
L.. - Wait.

1344
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:27,523
I'll come tomorrow.

1345
00:53:27,549 --> 00:53:28,205
Okay? - No, no..

1346
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,123
No, I'll come tomorrow.

1347
00:53:29,149 --> 00:53:30,440
- My duty is calling out to me.

1348
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,575
How can you go without me?

1349
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:32,103
I don't care.

1350
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:33,192
Stuff cotton in your ears.

1351
00:53:33,218 --> 00:53:34,010
You're disgusting.

1352
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,646
Wait, constable.

1353
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:50,193
Wait, constable.

1354
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:53,096
Brother! Good morning!

1355
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,098
Brother! What brother?

1356
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,733
I had explained to you yesterday"

1357
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,337
"that Indians and Pakistanis can never be brothers.

1358
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:01,384
You said that in the morning.

1359
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,973
Did you forget what you had said at night?

1360
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,709
A Pakistani helps an Indian.
Free ride.

1361
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:06,990
Don't joke with me.

1362
00:54:07,016 --> 00:54:09,012
Get out of the cab. Come on.

1363
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,714
Are you my sister-in-law that I would joke with you?

1364
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,148
Forget about your words, at least respect the English liquor..

1365
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:14,184
"After drinking which you made me your brother.

1366
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,319
I can never make an enemy my brother.

1367
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,021
No matter how much I drink with him.

1368
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,023
No matter how much I drink.

1369
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,658
Just cross the Wagha border and then I'll show you.

1370
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,288
Why would I cross the Wagha border?

1371
00:54:23,314 --> 00:54:24,127
Is that America?

1372
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,029
Don't mess with me, I'm telling you.

1373
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,397
Get lost! - Get out of the car.

1374
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,232
Idiot. - Come on.

1375
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:30,213
He comes every time..

1376
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:31,801
- Idiot! Is he a man or a woman?

1377
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:37,941
He will get beaten by me.

1378
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,943
Hello?

1379
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,578
Pooja?

1380
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:42,912
Where is everyone gone?

1381
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:45,515
Pooja?

1382
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:57,294
I'm scared.

1383
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,130
By the way, for what treatment have you come today?

1384
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,979
The treatment is just an excuse.

1385
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:03,366
I've come to meet you.

1386
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,168
Me? Why?

1387
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:10,140
Because since I've come from Punjab, I feel very lonely.

1388
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,941
Really? Why?

1389
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,877
Because my family is in Punjab.

1390
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:17,480
Since I've come, I just keep thinking
about when I'll go back to my family.

1391
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,216
But now.. - Now what?

1392
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,419
It seems difficult now.

1393
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,321
Difficult?

1394
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,322
Why?

1395
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:29,459
Because now, even over here,
some people are very close to me.

1396
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:32,896
So, I feel that it will be very difficult to leave them.

1397
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,731
Have you ever been to Punjab?

1398
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:35,939
I have. Once.

1399
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:40,770
When I was seven years old and weighed only 60 kgs.

1400
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,205
What? - Yes.

1401
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:46,176
Then?
- Then I got doubled and so did the ticket.

1402
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,411
I never felt like going again.

1403
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:49,579
But can I ask you something?

1404
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,215
What is in Punjab that's not in Canada?

1405
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:55,652
No, no.
There are a lot of things in Punjab that are not in Canada.

1406
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,154
Like what?
- Let's talk about art.

1407
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,756
Like in the rain..

1408
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:01,691
...when the cows twist their tails"

1409
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,560
...yellow flowers are printed on the wall.

1410
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,595
Will you find such art anywhere? - No, no.

1411
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,164
Secondly, it's allowed to pass stools openly there..

1412
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,899
"But you're not allowed to kiss.

1413
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:11,434
But it's the opposite here.

1414
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,436
Someone should ask them that if a person feels like kissing..

1415
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:14,804
...he can control himself.

1416
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,439
But how can one control himself for the other thing?

1417
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,475
Is there any other difference? - Yes.

1418
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:21,277
After a few days, you'll find a gem like Fateh Singh only in Punjab.

1419
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:25,348
You won't find him in Canada.

1420
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,884
You're leaving?

1421
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:32,122
That too alone.

1422
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:35,258
By the way, I wanted to see Punjab too.

1423
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:37,042
Can I come with you too?

1424
00:56:37,068 --> 00:56:38,528
If you don't mind.

1425
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:39,410
Why would I mind?

1426
00:56:39,436 --> 00:56:40,864
Pack your bags right away.

1427
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:41,558
Not right now.

1428
00:56:41,584 --> 00:56:44,334
First, you'll have to come to
my house for lunch tomorrow.

1429
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,369
For lunch? Why?

1430
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,304
I'll have to explain everything to you.

1431
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:50,340
To take my family's permission.

1432
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,243
My family won't send their young and beautiful daughter..

1433
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,412
...with a stranger just like that.

1434
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,180
What if you take advantage of me?

1435
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,815
Advantage? - Yes.

1436
00:56:58,815 --> 00:56:59,829
Of you?

1437
00:56:59,855 --> 00:57:03,887
- You can't pick me, but you can take advantage of me.

1438
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,456
I don't think I need to swear about this.

1439
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,526
But still, I swear that I'll never take advantage of you.

1440
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,895
Go away, you liar.

1441
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:22,639
You're beautiful.

1442
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,642
Let's go.

1443
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,444
Brother! Brother!

1444
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,448
Why do you mess with me?

1445
00:57:28,474 --> 00:57:29,913
You'll be thrashed unnecessarily.

1446
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:33,416
Brother, you can do whatever you want with me.

1447
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:34,984
I'll forgive you.

1448
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:39,055
Because Indians and Pakistanis are brothers.

1449
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:39,856
Brother again? - Yes.

1450
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,424
I don't consider you my brother.

1451
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,359
As if it's not a relationship but a work shift.

1452
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,130
Brother, you may vent your anger on me.

1453
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:51,434
But why are you angry with this innocent one?

1454
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,936
But I have a condition. - What?

1455
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,170
This time, I'll cross the border.

1456
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:54,905
Most welcome.

1457
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:56,349
Please come ahead. Come.

1458
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:56,940
- Really?

1459
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,659
Come. Come. Come.

1460
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:00,176
- Here I come.

1461
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:11,721
Hold this.

1462
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:14,357
Hold on, brother. I've got a call.

1463
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,192
It's sir's call.

1464
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,560
Hello, sir!

1465
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,358
Forget your hello.

1466
00:58:18,384 --> 00:58:19,377
It's been three days.

1467
00:58:19,403 --> 00:58:20,663
Why didn't you report to me?

1468
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,359
Sir, forget the report!

1469
00:58:22,385 --> 00:58:23,833
There's good news!

1470
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,635
Good news so soon?

1471
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:30,173
No! Pooja has agreed to come to Punjab!

1472
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,810
Look, I didn't need to use the weapon of my looks and Pooja agreed.

1473
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,778
She has invited me to her house tomorrow for lunch.

1474
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,213
Tomorrow I'll convince her family..

1475
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:40,250
...and the day after, Pooja and I will be heading to Punjab.

1476
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,052
Your advice worked, sir!

1477
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,455
This idiot is really lucky.

1478
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,857
No girl ever invited me over.

1479
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:51,761
And the DC's daughter invited him for lunch.

1480
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:55,565
Wait. Don't come. Wait. - Fateh!

1481
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:59,068
Yes. Come in.

1482
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,080
Where are you?

1483
00:59:00,106 --> 00:59:01,309
- On your right.

1484
00:59:01,335 --> 00:59:02,972
Come. Don't hesitate.

1485
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,241
Come. Welcome. Hello.

1486
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,509
What are you doing here?

1487
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:07,114
What do I tell you?

1488
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,578
The Punjab Police are in a really bad shape.

1489
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:11,180
I didn't get tired while running in marathons.

1490
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,383
...but I got tired running from the bedroom to the bathroom at night.

1491
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,485
Then I thought that an accident might happen on the way.

1492
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,353
So I got fed up and slept here itself.

1493
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,856
Did you sleep here all night? - Yes.

1494
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,391
There's nothing to feel disgusted about.

1495
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,294
If you have that light feeling, try it some time.

1496
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:25,361
It's very helpful.
- God!

1497
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:26,829
I'm going. We'll meet tomorrow.
- Wait. Wait.

1498
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:27,947
My duty is calling out to me.

1499
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:29,065
Just take this bucket and..

1500
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,700
You're disgusting!

1501
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:35,863
Disgusting!

1502
00:59:35,889 --> 00:59:39,347
- Stop!

1503
00:59:39,373 --> 00:59:44,781
Constable!

1504
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,650
Disgusting! Disgusting!

1505
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:48,736
Disgusting!

1506
00:59:48,762 --> 00:59:52,388
Disgusting! Disgusting! Disgusting!

1507
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,624
It's love.

1508
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:58,104
You'll get me in trouble someday.

1529
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,726
Across the border.

1530
01:00:09,752 --> 01:00:11,708
Brothers. Free ride.

1531
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,476
Get down.

1532
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,745
I don't understand why only you're standing here everyday.

1533
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,981
I begin my service from here every morning.

1534
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:18,539
This is my den!

1535
01:00:18,565 --> 01:00:19,916
-Are you a don that you have a den?

1536
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,050
Listen to me carefully.

1537
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,952
If I see you here again, then I'll flail you.

1538
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,753
What does flail mean?

1539
01:00:23,779 --> 01:00:24,821
- Why do you want to know?

1540
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,422
Get out of here or you'll have to pay fine.

1541
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,021
Why should I pay fine?

1542
01:00:28,047 --> 01:00:29,692
I have all my papers.

1543
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,663
But your steering wheel is on the left.

1544
01:00:31,689 --> 01:00:33,229
Who'll pay the fine for this?

1545
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:36,232
Idiot! Get lost!

1546
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,167
Strange.

1547
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:42,456
Even the Pakistani police don't know
this technique of demanding a fine.

1548
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:04,527
I was scared.

1549
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:05,306
What's the matter?

1550
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:06,562
You're all decked up today.

1551
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:07,530
Anything special?

1552
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,600
Just a little.

1553
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,273
You don't need to do this.

1554
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:14,203
You're already so beautiful.

1555
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:16,739
Go away, liar.

1556
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:17,886
You're beautiful.

1557
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,434
This is my mother.

1558
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,327
Mother, he's Fateh.

1559
01:01:33,353 --> 01:01:34,957
- Hello, mother.

1560
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,504
Don't call me mother.

1561
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,494
Call me aunt Jassi. Okay?

1562
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:39,696
Okay. Hello, aunt Jassi.

1563
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,508
What will you drink?

1564
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:41,564
- I'll drink buttermilk.

1565
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:46,436
Okay, dear, call your father and
tell him that there are guests at home.

1566
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:49,105
So, ask him to bring grandma home soon.
- Okay.

1567
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,140
I'll be right back with the buttermilk.

1568
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,777
Father? Grandma?

1569
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,651
Why are you so shocked?

1570
01:01:56,677 --> 01:01:58,281
Everyone has them.

1571
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,717
Aunt has a cousin husband too?

1572
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,452
What do you mean?

1573
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,954
Where's the bathroom?

1574
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:06,022
T h at way.

1575
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,297
I'll be right back.

1576
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,211
Hello. - Hello, sir.

1577
01:02:15,237 --> 01:02:16,766
This is Fateh Singh from Canada.

1578
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:17,723
Yes, Fateh Singh.

1579
01:02:17,749 --> 01:02:19,469
Tell me. What's the progress?

1580
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,332
There's good news, sir.

1581
01:02:20,358 --> 01:02:21,871
I've convinced Pooja to come to Punjab.

1582
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:22,653
Really? - Yes.

1583
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:24,273
I've come to Pooja's house.

1584
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,876
Her mother.. I mean, to take permission from your wife.

1585
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,377
But there's a problem here, sir.

1586
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:29,445
What problem?

1587
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:32,115
Sir, I think your wife got remarried.

1588
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,351
What? Tajinder got remarried?

1589
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:37,687
No, sir. Your wife's name is not Tajinder.
It's Jassi.

1590
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,297
What nonsense are you talking?

1591
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:41,390
You think I won't know my wife's name?

1592
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,859
Sir, it must be her nickname.

1593
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:47,597
You idiot, I've lived with that woman in the same house for 10 years.

1594
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,998
I don't know about it.

1595
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:51,400
And you've come to know her nickname in just 10 minutes?

1596
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,137
Sir, your general knowledge is weak and you're venting your anger on me.

1597
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:56,439
Now you'll say that you don't even know that your mother is here too.

1598
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:57,280
Shut up!

1599
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:00,643
It's been 12 years since my mother went to heaven.

1600
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,944
Sir, Canada is like heaven too.

1601
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,023
She must have come here and settled down.

1602
01:03:04,049 --> 01:03:04,914
- Shut up, idiot!

1603
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:08,084
Keep your mouth shut and use your brains.

1604
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:10,086
And go and clear the confusion.

1605
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:12,922
Yes, sir. - Nonsense.

1606
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:19,962
What a life we employees have.

1607
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,965
No. The talks.

1608
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:28,520
You'll get someone in trouble someday, silly.

1609
01:03:28,546 --> 01:03:30,573
I'm telling you.

1610
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:31,941
What are you doing here, constable?

1611
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,601
Forget about me.

1612
01:03:33,627 --> 01:03:34,950
You tell me.

1613
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:37,647
What are you doing here?

1614
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,636
Not I. I asked you first.

1615
01:03:39,662 --> 01:03:40,750
You tell me.

1616
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,919
You liar! I've come to catch your lie.

1617
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,754
You've been fooling me since three days.

1618
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:47,557
You said you had a stomachache, and
you're drinking buttermilk here.

1619
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:48,791
I didn't drink the buttermilk.

1620
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:50,026
Ask her.
I didn't even drink water.

1621
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:51,160
Don't change the topic.

1622
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:51,835
Tell the truth.

1623
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,229
Why did you go to her parlor?

1624
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,486
You're great, constable.

1625
01:03:54,512 --> 01:03:56,999
From where have you got these beautiful looks?

1626
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,569
You girls don't come out of the parlor for hours.

1627
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,604
When the Punjab Police wanted
to get some beauty treatment done..

1628
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:02,905
...you're using your third degree.
- Shut up.

1629
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:03,973
You went there for beauty treatment?

1630
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,174
Do cars ever get serviced?

1631
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,375
Stop your interrogation.

1632
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,277
How did you enter someone's house without a warrant?

1633
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:08,855
Get out of here.

1634
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:10,880
- I don't need a warrant to come to my friend's house.

1635
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,716
Preet is my friend.

1636
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:15,220
At least ask your friend what her name is.

1637
01:04:15,246 --> 01:04:15,885
Her name is Pooja.

1638
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:16,877
She's Preet.

1639
01:04:16,903 --> 01:04:17,787
I'm Pooja.

1640
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:18,840
Pooja, tell her.

1641
01:04:18,866 --> 01:04:20,289
She's lost her mind.

1642
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,160
She's right.

1643
01:04:21,186 --> 01:04:23,192
She's Pooja and I'm Preet.

1644
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,328
Did you understand, Mr. Fateh?

1645
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:28,865
What?

1646
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,500
But how can she be Pooja?

1647
01:04:30,526 --> 01:04:32,201
Pooja works in a parlor.

1648
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:32,842
I used to.

1649
01:04:32,868 --> 01:04:35,404
But when I joined the police force, I left the parlor.

1650
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:36,973
Couldn't you have told me this before?

1651
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,074
How would I have told you?

1652
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:41,844
Pooja had told everyone that she still works in the parlor.

1653
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,354
Her mother hates the police force.

1654
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,314
That's why.

1655
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:46,883
Did you understand?

1656
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:51,654
This means you're the real Ms. Pooja, constable?

1657
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:55,892
And I was flirting with this fatso without a reason.

1658
01:04:55,892 --> 01:05:00,396
You called me fatso?

1659
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,864
Mother!

1660
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:04,081
Don't you dare come here again!

1661
01:05:04,107 --> 01:05:04,867
Get lost!

1662
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:11,440
Pooja, get him out.

1663
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,710
I had a doubt on you since the very first day, constable.

1664
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,514
But now I'm sure that you didn't come here to solve the case..

1665
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:22,652
...but to entice an innocent girl like Preet and get settled here.

1666
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,154
But get ready to leave now.

1667
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:29,792
Now just wait and watch how
I get you deported within two days.

1668
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:45,708
He calls himself the Punjab Police.

1669
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,504
Are You satisfied now?

1670
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:48,811
Are You happy?

1671
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:53,049
I won't talk to You.

1672
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,684
But what will the Punjab Police do now?

1673
01:05:54,684 --> 01:06:02,491
There is no comparison of the Punjab Police.

1674
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:05,027
Buy my father.
- I'm sweet.

1675
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,530
For 50,000. - Totally.

1676
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,299
Buy my father. - I'm sweet.

1677
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:14,270
Son. My dear son, say it louder.

1678
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:17,974
The louder you say, the more you will be able to publicize.

1679
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,444
Father, I am unable to raise my voice.

1680
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:24,246
My heart is sad.

1681
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,882
I wish your dear son could be sold instead of you.

1682
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,918
Sorry to say, my dear son,

1683
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,854
but no one would have paid even a penny for you.

1684
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:33,889
These are contemporary times, son.

1685
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:37,693
The cruel world doesn't see the heart, but body.

1686
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:42,264
That's why once your father is sold for Rs. 50,000..

1687
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:46,302
...I'm sure that when my dear son goes to Canada..

1688
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:51,774
...he'll make so much money that he'll buy his father back.

1689
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:54,610
Love you, father. - Love you too.

1690
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,012
Love you, father. - Love you too.

1691
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,114
Father.
Father, a customer is coming.

1692
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,178
Don't get emotional.

1693
01:06:59,204 --> 01:07:00,349
Let's talk business.

1694
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,917
Open the first three buttons of your shirt.

1695
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,552
Three buttons? Why?

1696
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:07,723
Father, the more glamorous you look, the more the customer will pay.

1697
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:08,899
Buy my father!

1698
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:10,159
Buy my father!

1699
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,161
What?
- Buy Shampy's father.

1700
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:14,030
Why?
I have my own.

1701
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,400
You may have, brother, but not like Shampy's father.

1702
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,202
Really?
- Look how good he is.

1703
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,283
There's beauty. There's glamour.

1704
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:23,973
There's steel-like body.

1705
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:27,309
Do you look like your father?
- Yes.

1706
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,878
That's why you're ugly.

1707
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,746
Brother, if your face was like that of Shampy's father"

1708
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:34,050
...even you would have been good-looking like Shampy.

1709
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,519
Shampy's father has given Shampy everything.

1710
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:40,189
Business, a nice body, a vehicle.

1711
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:44,527
Just throw your useless father in the bin.

1712
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,163
What will you do with an ugly, good-for-nothing father?

1713
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:48,664
Buy Shampy's father.

1714
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,934
You will be happy and your mother will be happy too.

1715
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:54,370
Your dear son was slapped once!

1716
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:56,572
Your dear son was slapped twice!
- Shut up.

1717
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,674
Father!

1718
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:00,489
Your dear son was slapped thrice!

1719
01:08:00,515 --> 01:08:01,644
Why did you hit me?

1720
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,846
Why did you talk about his mother?

1721
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:05,614
Sorry.

1722
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:08,350
Buy my father.
- I'm sweet.

1723
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,903
For 50,000.

1724
01:08:10,929 --> 01:08:13,689
- Totally.

1725
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,959
You mean the DC's daughter doesn't work in a parlor.

1726
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:18,027
She's a constable?

1727
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,796
Sir, it's that constable who I harassed a lot.

1728
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,364
She wants to flail me now.

1729
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:23,712
I don't know what this flail' is.

1730
01:08:23,738 --> 01:08:24,733
What does 'flail' mean?

1731
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,435
Why do you want to know, sir?

1732
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,559
You tell me what I should do.

1733
01:08:28,585 --> 01:08:29,438
I'm stuck.

1734
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,190
What else can you do?

1735
01:08:31,216 --> 01:08:32,608
Just come back.

1736
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,010
Now she'll get you deported anyhow.

1737
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,946
Sir, it's entirely the DC's fault.

1738
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,481
The DC knows about the whole city.

1739
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:41,250
But he doesn't know about his daughter, sir.

1740
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,619
The girl's mother doesn't know what she's doing.

1741
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:46,489
How will sir know?

1742
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,959
Sir, you are so smart.

1743
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,527
What did I say now?

1744
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,896
I didn't think that the girl's mother doesn't know what she does.

1745
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:54,930
So what?

1746
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,866
It will work for us.
- How?

1747
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,400
Sir, just wait and watch.

1748
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,002
The girl might have all her papers..

1749
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,570
"But Fateh Singh will make her pay a fine.

1750
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,239
Bye. Love you.

1751
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:05,307
I wonder what's on his mind now.

1752
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:08,844
I really should keep my mouth shut.

1753
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:10,513
Really?
Have some more.

1754
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,148
Son, have some more.

1755
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:17,019
If I eat any more, then I'll get fat.

1756
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:19,555
Mother!
- I think Pooja is here.

1757
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:22,758
Aunt, I'll eat if you feed me.

1758
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:25,261
Because eating food from a mother's""s hand is pleasurable.

1759
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:26,896
Give me.

1760
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:29,899
Take this, son.

1761
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:32,301
You?
What are you doing here?

1762
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:35,905
Pooja, he came here looking for you.

1763
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:40,209
Why didn't you tell me that such a lovely Punjabi boy is your friend?

1764
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,244
He? He's not my friend.

1765
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:43,445
What?

1766
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:46,115
She doesn't work in a parlor either.

1767
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:47,683
What?

1768
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:50,452
Mother, I mean..

1769
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:52,048
He's not my friend.

1770
01:09:52,074 --> 01:09:55,491
He's a very dear friend of mine. Right?

1771
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:56,439
Yes. Yes.

1772
01:09:56,465 --> 01:10:00,229
She also works very well in the parlor.

1773
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:01,730
I see! I see!

1774
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,817
Mother, give me something to eat too.

1775
01:10:03,843 --> 01:10:04,833
I'm very hungry.

1776
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:05,968
Of course.
I'll get it right away.

1777
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:06,602
- Thanks, mother.

1778
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:07,609
You're hungry?

1779
01:10:07,635 --> 01:10:08,904
Here, have this.

1780
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:11,674
If you tell the truth to mother, then I won't spare you.

1781
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:14,343
Don't deport me and I won't tell the truth to your mother.

1782
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,045
I can't go against my duty.

1783
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:19,014
Even I can't betray the woman who fed me with so much love.

1784
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:21,350
Aunt!
- I promise.

1785
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:22,685
Don't you dare tell mother anything!

1786
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,653
If it's about a promise, then no matter what happens..

1787
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,388
...Fateh Singh won't tell her anything.

1788
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:28,087
What won't you tell, son?

1789
01:10:28,113 --> 01:10:30,125
- That she is a policewoman.

1790
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:33,306
What? - What?

1791
01:10:33,332 --> 01:10:35,264
- What?

1792
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:36,665
Is he telling the truth?

1793
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:40,302
Mother, I can explain.

1794
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:43,072
Oh, God!

1795
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:46,542
Oh, God!

1796
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:51,080
You weren't ashamed before deceiving your mother like that?

1797
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,960
I worked so hard to educate you.

1798
01:10:53,986 --> 01:10:54,950
For what?

1799
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,119
Mother" - So that you lie to me?

1800
01:10:57,119 --> 01:10:59,667
Mother, don't say that.

1801
01:10:59,693 --> 01:11:02,658
- What else should I say?

1802
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:05,928
If not the parlor, you should have joined a bank.

1803
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,463
You should have become a doctor.

1804
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:11,700
Why did you have to work with the police?

1805
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,504
You are your father's daughter, after all.

1806
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,506
Your mother doesn't have a right on you.

1807
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:20,376
Mother, I'll resign tomorrow itself if you say.

1808
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:21,944
But please don't get upset.

1809
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:22,405
No, aunt.

1810
01:11:22,431 --> 01:11:24,146
Tell her to resign today itself.

1811
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:26,949
What if you change your mind tomorrow?

1812
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,518
I'll change my mind? Why?

1813
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:30,919
Tomorrow you might feel that you were wrong.

1814
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,389
So, you might change your mind.

1815
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,525
My mind?
Wrong?

1816
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,360
No, aunt.
You're not wrong, but you might feel so.

1817
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,928
It would have been wrong if you had a son..

1818
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,430
...and you would have stopped him from joining the police force.

1819
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:42,089
She's a girl.

1820
01:11:42,115 --> 01:11:43,966
And it's our duty to suppress girls.

1821
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,635
Because girls and culture go hand in hand. Right, aunt?

1822
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,404
Yes. - Right?
- Yes.

1823
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:50,472
All of us feel that girls are not less than boys.

1824
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,074
Though girls are much more successful than boys.

1825
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:54,810
A boy may stand on the street for one hour, but no one will give him a lift.

1826
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,845
But if a girl stands, everyone wants to give her a lift.

1827
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:58,681
Girls have become thieves.
They murder.

1828
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,082
But why do we care about these achievements?

1829
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,718
We like those girls who get scared of cockroaches.

1830
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:04,887
And when we talk about marriage, they feel shy.

1831
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,789
After all, it's our culture to suppress girls.

1832
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:09,761
Because girls and culture go hand in hand.

1833
01:12:09,787 --> 01:12:10,659
Right, aunt?

1834
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,828
Yes. - That's why wake up, aunt!

1835
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,606
No, I mean.. let your conscience wake up.

1836
01:12:15,632 --> 01:12:16,532
You sit. Yes.

1837
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,734
Wake up and stop Pooja from doing what she likes to do.

1838
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:19,668
Because it's your duty.

1839
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,904
And also that granny who's been sleeping since ages.

1840
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:23,605
Because it's our culture to suppress girls.

1841
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,507
Because girls and culture go hand in hand.

1842
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:29,878
Long live revolution!

1843
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:33,282
Did I talk too much?

1844
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,754
No, son.

1845
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:39,355
What you said is right.

1846
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:44,193
If mothers don't change their thinking regarding their daughters..

1847
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,395
"Then how will the society's thinking change?

1848
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,230
What are you saying, aunt?

1849
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,500
I'm saying the right thing.

1850
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:55,513
Pooja dear, you can do what you feel like.

1851
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:57,473
I'll never stop you.

1852
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,209
Really, mother? - Yes.

1853
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,044
Mother. I love you.

1854
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:02,951
Love you too, dear.

1855
01:13:02,977 --> 01:13:03,895
I love you so much.

1856
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:04,813
Love you too.

1857
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:05,584
Oh, my God!

1858
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,915
You were amazing.

1859
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:10,686
You solved such a big problem of mine in a jiffy.

1860
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,122
The Punjab Police are talented as well.

1861
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,823
Seriously. Thank you, Fateh.

1862
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,158
Why are you thanking me?

1863
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:19,294
I solved your problem, so you help me too.

1864
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:22,064
Why should I help you?

1865
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:22,986
Hello. Hold on.

1866
01:13:23,012 --> 01:13:24,400
What do you mean why?

1867
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,468
We had promised each other.

1868
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:27,636
We had promised..

1869
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,538
"But you broke your promise by telling the truth to mother.

1870
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,607
So, technically, I can break it too.

1871
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,809
Technically, you don't look like a witch, but you are.

1872
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:34,357
I'm warning you.

1873
01:13:34,383 --> 01:13:35,077
Don't mess with me.

1874
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,545
Because if the Punjab Police's friendship is good..

1875
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,113
"Their animosity is worse than anything. -Okay.

1876
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:41,517
Relax. I don't intend to betray you, constable.

1877
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:45,788
I'm just saying that we'll break the
old promise and make a new one. Okay?

1878
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,423
New promise? Which one?

1879
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,490
First promise me.

1880
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,382
Why should I promise?

1881
01:13:49,408 --> 01:13:50,826
I wonder what you might ask for.

1882
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,629
Really?
Are you scared?

1883
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:55,597
If that's the matter, then see my guts.

1884
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:57,166
You can ask for my life too.

1885
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,134
Come on, let's promise.

1886
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:00,302
What are you doing?

1887
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,004
Girls like you do anything.

1888
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,539
Shake hands.

1889
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:06,675
Go away. Promise.

1890
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:07,820
Okay.

1891
01:14:07,846 --> 01:14:12,399
Here's my promise.

1892
01:14:12,425 --> 01:14:14,555
Tell me what the problem is.

1893
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,356
My hand.

1894
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:21,962
It's yours.

1895
01:14:21,988 --> 01:14:23,892
I'm not taking it along. Tell me.

1896
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,195
Well..

1897
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:28,797
There's a boy.

1898
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:29,364
Krish?

1899
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:30,642
- Not Krish, sir. Chris.

1900
01:14:30,668 --> 01:14:31,633
He's a foreigner.

1901
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:32,768
She wants to marry him.

1902
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:34,369
And she wants me to convince her mother.

1903
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:36,371
Tell me.
Have I come to take her back or do all this?

1904
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,706
Sir, am I her uncle?

1905
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:39,675
The police are like uncles to everyone.

1906
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,610
Sir, don't explain relationships to me. Give me a solution.

1907
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,679
Am I a guide here to give you solutions every time?

1908
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,081
Whenever there's a problem, you call me.

1909
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:47,816
My mind is jammed.

1910
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,047
Sir, don't get angry.

1911
01:14:49,073 --> 01:14:50,219
Try to understand.

1912
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,187
If her mother agrees, then Pooja won't come to Punjab.

1913
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:54,590
And if I'm unable to convince her
mother, then she'll get me deported.

1914
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:56,058
What do I do? I'm stuck.

1915
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,602
You're concerned about your problem.

1916
01:14:57,628 --> 01:14:58,760
My life is in a mess too.

1917
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,095
What's the matter, sir?

1918
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:02,664
My mother-in-law has come to live in my house permanently.

1919
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:03,632
The lady-don.

1920
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,097
Sir, that's a very big problem.

1921
01:15:05,123 --> 01:15:06,468
I always say that if your..

1922
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,670
...mother-in-law isn't good, it's better that she dies.

1923
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,973
A mother-in-law looks good when she lives in her own house.

1924
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:13,140
She came and told me, Keep me here, son.

1925
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,409
I will stay in a corner.

1926
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:19,314
I say, let her stay in a corner, but in her own house.

1927
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:20,215
Sir, I've got it.

1928
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:21,483
Don't get too excited.

1929
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,318
You'll realize when your mother-in-law comes to your house.

1930
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:24,663
Sir, I've got a scheme in mind.

1931
01:15:24,689 --> 01:15:25,487
I've got an idea.

1932
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:26,376
Just hang up.

1933
01:15:26,402 --> 01:15:28,223
Thank you.
 Love you. Bye.

1934
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:30,659
He found an idea from this as well.

1935
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:37,099
Can't I even discuss my problem with anyone?

1936
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:38,300
So this is Fateh.

1937
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,002
Yes, and he's going to solve our problem.

1938
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,737
Hi. - How are you, Chottu?

1939
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:43,472
Chottu?
What does that mean?

1940
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:44,863
Just a nickname.

1941
01:15:44,889 --> 01:15:46,775
He's super friendly.

1942
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:49,177
If you make fun of Chris, then just watch it.

1943
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:51,055
Look. Nature is making fun of him.

1944
01:15:51,081 --> 01:15:52,381
I don't need to do it.

1945
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:56,251
Firstly he's not a Punjabi and he wants to marry you.

1946
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:57,619
What's going on, Pooja?

1947
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:59,721
One sec, Chris.
Really?

1948
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:03,191
So, I'll call Paul right away and ask
him to get you deported tomorrow.

1949
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,380
What did you say?

1950
01:16:04,406 --> 01:16:05,360
Say it again.

1951
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,562
I said

1952
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:14,970
I'll call Paul right away and ask him to get you deported tomorrow.

1953
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:17,639
That's it?
You spoke to me lovingly and I agreed.

1954
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,241
Punjabis can't be forced for anything.
- Really?

1955
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,319
Don't worry. Chris

1956
01:16:20,345 --> 01:16:21,337
is my brother.

1957
01:16:21,363 --> 01:16:22,544
See. Don't worry.

1958
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:23,389
He likes you.

1959
01:16:23,415 --> 01:16:25,013
- Good. I like him too.

1960
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:25,400
Love you.

1961
01:16:25,426 --> 01:16:26,648
- Great. You boys carry on.

1962
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,016
I'm going to go use the ladies room.

1963
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,986
See you in a bit.

1964
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:34,022
How dare you entice a Punjabi girl in the presence of a Punjabi boy.

1965
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,425
What are you saying, bro?

1966
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:40,162
You are doomed! Idiot!

1967
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:41,763
Have you ever drunk alcohol or do you only lift bottles?

1968
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:42,798
Alcohol?

1969
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:44,457
Have you ever drunk alcohol?

1970
01:16:44,483 --> 01:16:45,701
Alcohol? - Alcohol?

1971
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:46,902
Oh, alcohol.
- Have you ever drunk alcohol?

1972
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,571
Yes. - Have you got drunk?

1973
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:54,655
I'll show you.

1974
01:16:54,681 --> 01:16:57,794
Come on.

1975
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,296
Come on.

1976
01:17:01,322 --> 01:17:05,187
Bring it.

1977
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,823
Her dance is mesmerizing.

1978
01:17:07,823 --> 01:17:10,559
Mesmerizing.

1979
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:13,195
Her black hair flies.

1980
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:15,864
Flies.

1981
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:18,533
Her dance is mesmerizing.

1982
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:21,169
Her black hair flies.

1983
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:22,270
Flies.

1984
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,406
She entered the club..

1985
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:29,077
"Lifting her shoulders.

1986
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,146
The damsel dances..

Lifting her shoulders.

2001
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:59,608
All the white girls fled.

2002
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:04,846
Leaving him behind.

2003
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:07,816
All the white girls fled.

2004
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:11,553
Leaving him behind.

2005
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:16,458
You spread intoxication with your eyes..

2021
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,765
The boys will lose their senses today.

Come on! How was it?

2041
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:45,313
It was great, but had it been Indian..

2042
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,591
I'm talking about Chris.

2043
01:19:46,617 --> 01:19:47,816
Will mother like him?

2044
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:49,451
Your mother will not like him at all.

2045
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,520
Why? - Because he's
not Punjabi like me.

2046
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,122
Okay, so just because he's not Punjabi, he's not a nice boy.

2047
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,272
No, no. He's a very nice boy.

2048
01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:56,224
He's very intelligent.

2049
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:58,460
The whole of Punjab doesn’t speak
that much even after they are drunk.

2050
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,295
Oh, my God! I don't understand"

2051
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:03,598
...why every Punjabi is after English after drinking.

2052
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:05,033
English is their mother tongue,

2053
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,836
and it is our duty to learn that after drinking.

2054
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:08,274
Very funny.

2055
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,905
Did you like anything else about Chris?

2056
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:12,974
Yes, I did. Brother is so warm.

2057
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,543
The way he was hugging girls..

2058
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:17,245
...a Punjabi man doesn't even hug his wife so many times in his whole life.

2059
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:20,182
Hold on. Embracing someone while meeting is the culture here. Okay?

2060
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,818
I see. If it's a culture, it's forgiven.

2061
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,719
If a Punjabi boy even touches you like that.

2062
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,488
...you get so furious as if he's trying to kill you.

2063
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,957
Well, the reputation of Punjabi boys is bad.

2064
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:30,525
What have Punjabi boys done to you?

2065
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:32,031
Since you harass girls so much.

2066
01:20:32,057 --> 01:20:33,829
You don't have any sense of talking.

2067
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,530
On the very first day of college, you consider girls your property.

2068
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:36,017
That one is yours.

2069
01:20:36,043 --> 01:20:36,531
This one is mine.

2070
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,733
As if she's not a girl, but a plot of land.

2071
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:40,769
And you don't want to get to know the girl.

2072
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:43,572
You'll just propose directly after two years.

2073
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:45,173
Even girls treat us like that.

2074
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:48,210
They treat boys like puppies.

2075
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:51,680
When the boy proposes, you want to flail us.

2076
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,566
What does flail mean?

2077
01:20:52,592 --> 01:20:53,748
- Why do you want to know?

2078
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:55,450
You just get rid of him. Okay?

2079
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:56,921
Neither does he belong here, nor there.

2080
01:20:56,947 --> 01:20:58,053
How can you marry such a boy?

2081
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:01,056
No matter what you say, I will marry Chris.

2082
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:02,858
That too not in the Indian way, but in a church.

2083
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,294
Just tell me whether you'll help me or not.

2084
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:08,335
Think about it once again.

2085
01:21:08,361 --> 01:21:10,532
All boys are not the same.

2086
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,768
There are some like me too.
Lovable..

2087
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:15,770
You look like an idiot to me.

2088
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:17,339
Fine, don't do it, silly.

2089
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:18,907
You won't understand my value.

2090
01:21:18,907 --> 01:21:20,408
Go and tell your Chris.

2091
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:21,183
I'll train him.

2092
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,450
I'll do a favor on him.

2093
01:21:22,476 --> 01:21:23,044
It's okay.

2094
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:23,879
Training for what?

2095
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,714
Your mother wants a Punjabi son-in-law. Okay?

2096
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:26,665
I'll have to train him.

2097
01:21:26,691 --> 01:21:28,483
I'll have to make that foreigner a Punjabi.

2098
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:29,751
You have a point.

2099
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:31,061
Isn't it a good idea?

2100
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:33,555
Then shake hands with me and thank me.

2101
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:37,225
Thank you, constable.

2102
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:40,495
It's okay, constable. -All right.

2103
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:41,696
It's okay, constable.

2104
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:42,664
Okay. It's okay.

2105
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:44,766
L.. - Let go of it. - My hand..

2106
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:45,767
Let go of it.

2107
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:48,870
Fateh, my hand.

2108
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:49,356
It's yours.

2109
01:21:49,382 --> 01:21:50,505
I'm not taking it along.

2110
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:52,607
God has given me two hands already.

2111
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:54,509
Let's go.
- I've always eaten from my hard-earned money.

2112
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:56,141
Let's go.

2113
01:21:56,167 --> 01:22:01,583
- This is the Punjab Police.

2114
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,184
You try.

2115
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:04,953
No. It doesn't look nice.

2116
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:07,555
This is only a small sound. Fail.

2117
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:08,957
It means you don't like the food.

2118
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:11,159
If you want to tell your mother-in-law that the food is very good..

2119
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,360
"Then a big one.

2120
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,296
Like, atom bomb.
- Oh!

2121
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:17,198
Atom bomb.

2122
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,275
Like this.

2123
01:22:20,301 --> 01:22:22,737
Try it.

2124
01:22:22,737 --> 01:22:24,673
Okay?
- Nuclear bomb. Nuclear bomb.

2125
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:25,807
Yes, nuclear bomb.

2126
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,310
Now I'll show everybody I'm a real Punjabi macho.

2127
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:29,678
Hey! Save something for tomorrow.

2128
01:22:29,704 --> 01:22:31,046
Do you want to do it all today?

2129
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:32,247
Okay.
Okay. Okay.

2130
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:35,417
Now how do I tell Pooja's mother that she's really nice?

2131
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,246
You're naughty.

2132
01:22:36,272 --> 01:22:38,787
You want to impress your mother-in-law. Okay.

2133
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:39,888
I'll tell you

2134
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,790
what you're supposed to say to your mother-in-law and granny.

2135
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,025
Everything.
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

2136
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:44,864
Don't thank me.

2137
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:45,927
Tell me something.

2138
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:48,463
How will you greet them in Punjabi?

2139
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,099
Greetings. - No, brother.

2140
01:22:50,125 --> 01:22:51,866
No. I'll teach you. Come.

2141
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:52,913
Why should I tell her?

2142
01:22:52,939 --> 01:22:53,960
You had promised me.

2143
01:22:53,986 --> 01:22:54,769
So you tell her.

2144
01:22:54,769 --> 01:22:58,640
I had promised to help you and not to
get beaten up by your mother. Okay?

2145
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,742
You do something too. Crazy!

2146
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:03,745
Will you tell mother about Chris or should I call Paul?

2147
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:05,199
What? What?

2148
01:23:05,225 --> 01:23:07,182
Say it again.

2149
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:16,458
Will you tell her or should I call Paul?

2150
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,727
Look, Punjabis can never be forced.

2151
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:20,228
You can even kill us with love.

2152
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:21,830
You told me lovingly and I agreed.

2153
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,598
Now just wait and watch how I'll explain to aunt lovingly.

2154
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:25,900
She won't even realize and she'll agree.

2155
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,836
What do you want to explain to aunt lovingly?

2156
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,305
That Pooja likes a foreigner, aunt.

2157
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:31,239
What?

2158
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:33,341
What?

2159
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,210
What?

2160
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:37,097
Pooja.. is he telling the truth?

2161
01:23:37,123 --> 01:23:39,514
-I can explain, mother.
lt's""'s just..

2162
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,116
Oh, God!

2163
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:44,619
Oh, God!
What a daughter I've given birth to..

2164
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,821
"That doesn't let her mother live in peace!

2165
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:48,923
Mother"
-I know it! I know..

2166
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:51,126
"That you found a foreigner on purpose to trouble me.

2167
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,427
I know it!
- No! No!

2168
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:55,397
God, why didn't You kill me before I could see all this?

2169
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:57,032
Oh, God!
Mother, please don't say this.

2170
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,199
If you've felt so bad

2171
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,168
then I'll refuse Chris tomorrow itself.
Okay? - No.

2172
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:01,636
Tell her to go and refuse today itself.

2173
01:24:01,636 --> 01:24:03,371
What if you change your mind tomorrow, aunt?

2174
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:04,739
Why would I change my mind?

2175
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:06,975
If you feel that you're wrong, then you might change your mind, aunt.

2176
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:07,676
How am I wrong?

2177
01:24:07,702 --> 01:24:08,843
- No, you're not wrong.

2178
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:09,911
But you might feel so.

2179
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:11,546
You would have been wrong if you had a son..

2180
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,348
...and you would have stopped him from falling in love with a foreigner.

2181
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:14,249
She's a girl.

2182
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:15,984
And it's our culture to suppress girls.

2183
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:17,618
Because girls and culture..

2184
01:24:17,644 --> 01:24:19,554
- Walk hand in hand, isn't it?

2185
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:21,456
Yes, aunt.

2186
01:24:21,456 --> 01:24:25,160
Son, by the way, where have you learnt this speech from?

2187
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,728
When I was in the 9th standard for the third year..

2188
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:28,096
...I had participated in a debate competition.

2189
01:24:28,096 --> 01:24:30,265
I came fourth in it from amongst five people.

2190
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:32,867
I think my speech has impressed you.

2191
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:35,970
No. Your speech didn't impress me.

2192
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:38,406
But son,

2193
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,708
your thoughts have impressed me.

2194
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:45,113
Yes!
- My girl should have the right to choose her life partner.

2195
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:48,850
Yes! - Even if it's a foreigner.

2196
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,326
Really, mother? Oh, my God!

2197
01:24:50,352 --> 01:24:52,020
Thank you!
Thank you, mother!

2198
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,287
Wait. Not so soon.

2199
01:24:54,313 --> 01:24:55,924
Not so soon.

2200
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:59,294
I'll see him first, examine him and then decide.

2201
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:00,368
Okay? - Okay.

2202
01:25:00,394 --> 01:25:01,029
- Okay.

2203
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:13,475
So, when is the foreigner coming?

2204
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:15,310
One, two, three, four.

2205
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,079
One, two, three, four.

2206
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:23,618
Dance!

2207
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,345
A beggar is here, dear.

2208
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:26,921
Give me some money.

2209
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:29,591
Wait. Let the marriage happen first.

2210
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,526
Aunt, this is Chris.
- Yes.

2211
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:32,293
Yes.

2212
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,028
Hi.

2213
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:36,164
So, tell me, Chris, what do you do?

2214
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,381
Mother, Chris has his own..

2215
01:25:37,407 --> 01:25:38,733
- You don't talk in between.

2216
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:40,935
I want to talk to Chris.

2217
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:41,970
Okay.

2218
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,471
Yes, Chris.

2219
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:46,241
Well, I'm actually a chef and I own a restaurant.

2220
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:47,809
Oh, that's good.

2221
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:50,478
So, what do you know about our Punjabi culture?

2222
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:52,914
Oh, I know lots about the Punjabi culture.

2223
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:54,716
I love the Punjabi culture.

2224
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:56,391
Especially the food.

2225
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:58,820
And this food is very good.

2226
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:06,494
Here, I'll show you.

2227
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:09,464
See. The food is very good.

2228
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:10,882
Yes, yes. All right.

2229
01:26:10,908 --> 01:26:11,733
Good. Good.

2230
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:14,335
And you're good too.

2231
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:19,770
I say, beautiful.

2232
01:26:19,796 --> 01:26:24,245
You are sexy.

2233
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:26,147
What did you say, you scoundrel!

2234
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:27,809
Chris, what are you saying?

2235
01:26:27,835 --> 01:26:28,917
- No. No. Pooja,

2236
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:31,619
I got this under control.

2237
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:34,493
And you, granny.

2238
01:26:34,519 --> 01:26:37,959
Why don't you die?

2239
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:40,061
You witch.

2240
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:45,241
Yes. Dance.

2241
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,390
What's my fault?

2242
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:56,544
I taught him something else.

2243
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:58,680
He said something completely different.

2244
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,668
I made a mistake.

2245
01:26:59,694 --> 01:27:00,715
I'm really sorry.

2246
01:27:00,741 --> 01:27:02,750
- Your mistake ruined everything.

2247
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,253
You are a lovely woman!

2248
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:07,789
Shut up, Chris! Enough.

2249
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:08,667
What?
Did I say it wrong?

2250
01:27:08,693 --> 01:27:09,791
- No, it's very good. - Wrong.

2251
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:12,927
Idiot, we're in trouble because of you! Dance!

2252
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:14,162
Okay. Dance.

2253
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:15,430
You are flailed.

2254
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:17,065
Why do you keep saying that?

2255
01:27:17,091 --> 01:27:18,233
What does it mean?

2256
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,367
Why do you want to know?

2257
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:22,937
I think all of us should now think about what is to be done ahead.

2258
01:27:22,937 --> 01:27:23,978
Please don't think.

2259
01:27:24,004 --> 01:27:25,073
Just do one thing.

2260
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,008
Convince mother to meet Chris again.

2261
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:28,800
Mother will be convinced with one speech.

2262
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:29,611
Consider that done.

2263
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:31,546
This time, everyone will come to Chris's house.

2264
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:33,014
They will come to Chris's house.

2265
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,515
But I'm thinking about.

2266
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:37,151
"What else I need to teach my brother Chris to impress aunt.

2267
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:37,765
No, no, no.

2268
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:40,221
This time, not you, but I will teach Chris.

2269
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:42,123
You? - Yes.

2270
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:42,886
Okay, you teach him.

2271
01:27:42,912 --> 01:27:43,725
I'm not free anyway.

2272
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,493
The Punjab Police have a lot of work to do.

2273
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:46,661
Right, brother Chris?

2274
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:48,830
Fateh's rules.

2275
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:54,902
So, the male officers and the lovely lady officers.

2276
01:27:54,902 --> 01:27:57,205
This information was on Fateh's rules.

2277
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:59,540
Now we'll talk about the other weapon of the Punjab Police..

2278
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,210
...that is the stick of the Punjab Police.

2279
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:06,447
Kids, your stick is very small, like a toothbrush.

2280
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:07,415
It's useless.

2281
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:10,051
The stick of the Punjab Police, my deputy, is very long.

2282
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:11,845
It has many benefits.

2283
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:13,554
The first benefit.

2284
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:15,189
Write it.

2285
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:16,658
Lovely lady.

2286
01:28:16,658 --> 01:28:18,526
Oh, the first benefit is..

2287
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,695
"That it's very helpful when you encounter enemies.

2288
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:23,931
Mark, hit me with your toothbrush.

2289
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:28,202
Hit me with your toothbrush.

2290
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:29,685
See, the toothbrush is small.

2291
01:28:29,711 --> 01:28:31,372
You'll be slapped and insulted.

2292
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:33,875
The Punjab Police don't like insult.

2293
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:38,246
Mark, now you hit me.

2294
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:40,748
See, with the stick of the Punjab
Police, you won't be insulted.

2295
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:44,519
Children, applaud.

2296
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:46,112
The second benefit.

2297
01:28:46,138 --> 01:28:47,622
Mark, come here.

2298
01:28:47,622 --> 01:28:49,843
See, our Mark is a healthy man.

2299
01:28:49,869 --> 01:28:51,993
He eats and drinks properly.

2300
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,828
But a big stomach needs support.

2301
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:58,700
So, the Punjab Police's stick helps.
- Wow!

2302
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,701
Thank you. Thank you.

2303
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:01,602
Go and sit.

2304
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:03,205
Now, the third benefit.

2305
01:29:03,231 --> 01:29:04,739
The biggest benefit.

2306
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:07,575
This stick can be used for style as well.

2307
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:10,144
Look and see.

2308
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:15,550
Because the Punjab Police has a style as well.

2309
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:22,790
I mean, the Punjab Police is stylish also.

2310
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:26,094
Okay. Fine.
Class dismissed. Come on, leave.

2311
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:28,629
Come on, leave.

2312
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:29,764
Thank you, Fateh.

2313
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:31,165
That was very good.

2314
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:32,333
Why are you thanking me, Mr. Paul?

2315
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:35,002
We want the whole world to have the weapons of the Punjab Police.

2316
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:38,072
I've told you about all the weapons of the Punjab Police, except one.

2317
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:38,940
What's that, Fateh?

2318
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,675
That's the biggest weapon of the Punjab Police.

2319
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:41,909
With that, the Punjab Police can do even..

2320
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:43,411
"The most difficult jobs very easily.

2321
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:44,846
Tell us about it too.

2322
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:46,006
No, no, Mr. Paul.

2323
01:29:46,032 --> 01:29:47,849
I can't tell you about it.

2324
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:55,990
But I'll use it if I get a chance.

2325
01:29:55,990 --> 01:30:00,895
It's""s kept on the table.

2326
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:04,332
Pooja, ask your mother about the food.

2327
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:07,735
Mother, Chris wants to know if you like the food.

2328
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,156
It's good.

2329
01:30:09,182 --> 01:30:14,842
But tell him that I can praise only with words.

2330
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:16,687
Aunt, forget all that now.

2331
01:30:16,713 --> 01:30:19,313
Look, Chris worked so hard for you.

2332
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:21,082
He's prepared something with these leaves.

2333
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:25,052
Mother, Chris has also prepared a speech for you.

2334
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:29,924
Chris.

2335
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:36,964
Dearest mother-in-law, please forgive me for that day.

2336
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:39,167
I know you want a Punjabi boy for Pooja.

2337
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:45,406
But I promise that I will keep Pooja so happy..

2338
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:51,913
...that you will say that Chris is better than Punjabi boys.

2339
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:52,747
That's""s it.

2340
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:54,582
Thank you.

2341
01:30:54,582 --> 01:30:56,851
Oh. Dance.

2342
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:58,586
Very good, Chris.

2343
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:00,320
Wow! You're impressive.

2344
01:31:00,346 --> 01:31:02,356
Aunt, you must agree now.

2345
01:31:02,356 --> 01:31:05,293
I think he'll take care of you as well, along with Pooja.

2346
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:06,961
Let's do one thing.

2347
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:10,198
You can shift with Pooja after their wedding.

2348
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:11,766
The love between Pooja and you will remain intact.

2349
01:31:11,766 --> 01:31:13,968
...and your son-in-law will get the opportunity to serve you too.
Right?

2350
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:14,789
No, son.

2351
01:31:14,815 --> 01:31:18,072
Parents don't live in
their daughter's house.

2352
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:20,908
Aunt, I think I will have to give another speech.

2353
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:24,245
When parents can stay with their son
after marriage, why not with daughters?

2354
01:31:24,245 --> 01:31:26,314
Right, Pooja?
- Absolutely.

2355
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:29,383
Mother, I want you to live with us.

2356
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:31,486
I'll get all the happiness
under the same roof.

2357
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,252
But dear..
- Aunt, you'll have to stay.

2358
01:31:33,278 --> 01:31:34,655
That's it.
End of discussion.

2359
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:35,923
Don't say anything else.

2360
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:39,260
Can somebody please tell me what you're talking about?

2361
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:42,897
Chris, I want mother and granny to stay with us after our marriage.

2362
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:45,800
I'm sure you're okay with that, right?

2363
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,602
Why would he have a problem?

2364
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:50,037
A Punjabi son-in-law would have a problem with something like that.

2365
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:53,274
He's better than a Punjabi son-in-law.

2366
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:56,577
Pooja, could I please talk to you in the other room for a minute?

2367
01:31:56,577 --> 01:31:58,079
Yes.

2368
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,047
Mother, I'll be right back.

2369
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:01,482
Excuse me. - Excuse me.

2370
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:03,584
<i>Aunt. .</i>

2371
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:05,853
I think both of them have gone to talk about which room..

2372
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:11,158
...to give you after the marriage and..

2373
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:14,929
...which room granny should get.

2374
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:17,398
How are we supposed to share our lives with someone else?

2375
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:19,057
Those are not strangers, Chris.

2376
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:19,967
It's my family.

2377
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:22,103
I haven't lived with my family since I was 18.

2378
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:23,871
How do you expect me to live with yours?

2379
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,201
Well, I'm their only child.

2380
01:32:25,227 --> 01:32:26,974
I can't leave them after marriage.

2381
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:29,243
If I don't look after them, then who else will?

2382
01:32:29,243 --> 01:32:30,249
This is our culture.

2383
01:32:30,275 --> 01:32:32,413
- I don't care about your stupid culture.

2384
01:32:32,413 --> 01:32:34,181
Or your stupid traditions.

2385
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:35,917
How dare you say that?

2386
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:37,254
I respected you, all right?

2387
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,986
So you better respect my culture.

2388
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:40,421
I don't care.

2389
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:43,891
Mother and granny are staying with us and that is final.

2390
01:32:43,891 --> 01:32:45,426
Got it?

2391
01:32:45,426 --> 01:32:48,362
I don't want to live with your mother or your crazy old granny.

2392
01:32:48,362 --> 01:32:50,631
Who's as good as dead anyway.

2393
01:32:50,631 --> 01:32:51,566
Oh gosh!

2394
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:53,301
How dare you insult my family!

2395
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:56,571
If you can't respect my family, then you can't be my life partner.

2396
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,506
I don't understand what you just said..

2397
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:02,109
"But all I have to say is get lost, you stupid Punjabi girl!

2398
01:33:02,109 --> 01:33:05,413
You..

2399
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,515
Mother, let's go!

2400
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:11,052
Aunt, let's go.

2401
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:18,025
Dance!

2402
01:33:18,025 --> 01:33:21,395
I must call sir.

2403
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:23,598
Hello.

2404
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:27,768
Hello, sir. Fateh Singh reporting.

2405
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:31,839
Hello.
- Joginder, it's a test for you today.

2406
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:34,742
Hello.
- Don't you dare utter any rubbish today.

2407
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:36,177
Hello.

2408
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:38,007
Sir, you're not talking.

2409
01:33:38,033 --> 01:33:39,914
- No, Fateh. Not today.

2410
01:33:39,914 --> 01:33:41,415
I won't give you any idea today.

2411
01:33:41,415 --> 01:33:43,250
Sir, I haven't called you for a suggestion.

2412
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:45,820
I called to tell you that Pooja has broken up with the foreigner..

2413
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,421
...and I'm bringing her to Punjab.

2414
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:50,024
What?
- Everything has happened because of you.

2415
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:51,081
Just help me one more time.

2416
01:33:51,107 --> 01:33:52,059
- What do you want now?

2417
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:54,195
Sir, get the police station cleaned.

2418
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:56,263
And ask the tailor to stitch an inspector's uniform for me.

2419
01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:58,099
I'll wear it as soon as I reach there.

2420
01:33:58,099 --> 01:34:00,668
And sir, let me tell you something.

2421
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:03,838
No matter how successful I am, I'll never forget you.

2422
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:06,007
I love you, sir.

2423
01:34:06,007 --> 01:34:07,178
Okay, sir.
I'll hang up now.

2424
01:34:07,204 --> 01:34:09,143
I have to do my final setting with Pooja now.

2425
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:11,145
How will you convince her?

2426
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:17,351
Sir, if nothing else works, I have the weapon of my looks.

2427
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:18,896
Okay, bye.

2428
01:34:18,922 --> 01:34:20,287
See you.

2429
01:34:20,287 --> 01:34:23,057
I didn't say anything today.

2430
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:25,993
This idiot is very lucky.

2431
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,795
But he doesn't know that my eyes are red..

2432
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:29,497
...and there are three stars on my shoulder.

2433
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:32,566
Consider the days of you being fired closer.

2434
01:34:32,566 --> 01:34:34,168
Balirama.
-Yes, sir?

2435
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:40,014
Bring Shampy and his father to the police station.

2436
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,475
- Yes, sir.

2437
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:42,915
Aunt, where's Pooja?

2438
01:34:42,941 --> 01:34:45,579
She did not even come to work today.

2439
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:48,582
Son, she's not in a good mood since that day.

2440
01:34:48,582 --> 01:34:51,052
I tried a lot to explain to her, but"

2441
01:34:51,052 --> 01:34:52,261
Aunt, Fateh Singh is here.

2442
01:34:52,287 --> 01:34:53,888
Everything will be all right now.

2443
01:34:53,888 --> 01:35:17,645
Where is she?

2444
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:19,146
Constable, you're here?

2445
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:20,614
I was looking for you at the police station.

2446
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:24,652
Don't we have to go look for dacoit Shampy today?

2447
01:35:24,652 --> 01:35:26,520
We will find Shampy anyway.

2448
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:27,712
It's such a nice weather.

2449
01:35:27,738 --> 01:35:29,190
Let's have tea and dumplings.

2450
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:33,127
Fateh, I'm not in the mood to listen to your nonsense. Please leave.

2451
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:33,710
This is nice.

2452
01:35:33,736 --> 01:35:35,996
You're angry at Chris and you're venting it at me.

2453
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:37,998
You've been hurt just once.

2454
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:40,735
You don't know how many girls have rejected me.

2455
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,436
But I still never took it to heart.

2456
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:44,238
Don't compare me to yourself. Okay?

2457
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:45,473
Don't I feel hurt?

2458
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:47,007
Your heart means something and my heart means nothing?

2459
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:50,578
Do you know how bad I felt once, when a pickpocket rejected me?

2460
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:51,479
A Pickpocket?

2461
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:52,813
Yes, she used to come to the police station.

2462
01:35:52,813 --> 01:35:54,081
We fell in love.

2463
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:55,216
We were going to get married too.

2464
01:35:55,216 --> 01:35:57,218
I told her that she would have to quit all this after marriage.

2465
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:59,553
But she taunted me saying that even I was a typical man..

2466
01:35:59,553 --> 01:36:01,789
...who wants his wife to be a housewife and under his control.

2467
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:03,657
She said that and stole my wallet and left.

2468
01:36:03,657 --> 01:36:05,526
Good. Men like you deserve this.

2469
01:36:05,526 --> 01:36:07,061
Am I so bad?

2470
01:36:07,061 --> 01:36:09,263
But still, I didn't take it to heart.

2471
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:12,066
Then I enticed another girl.

2472
01:36:12,066 --> 01:36:14,535
She dumped me too.
- Why?

2473
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:16,070
She was a rag-picker.

2474
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:19,006
She told me that there were a lot of glass pieces in my trash.

2475
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:21,742
Actually, I drink like this.

2476
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:23,210
But I didn't take it to heart.

2477
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:24,809
Then I enticed another girl..

2478
01:36:24,835 --> 01:36:25,746
- Let me guess.

2479
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:28,415
She rejected you too, right?

2480
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:30,417
Then Fateh Singh rejected her.

2481
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:31,719
Why? Wasn't she a nice girl?

2482
01:36:31,719 --> 01:36:33,521
She was the only daughter of the owner of McDonald's.

2483
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:34,288
Wait. Wait.

2484
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:37,057
You rejected the daughter of the owner of McDonald's?
You?

2485
01:36:37,057 --> 01:36:39,994
Yes. They were not giving fries in the marriage.

2486
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:45,933
Fateh, you think I'll laugh on your
stupid jokes, hug you and thank you?

2487
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:47,234
Okay, don't hug me.

2488
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:49,703
Are you going to leave or should I call Paul?

2489
01:36:49,703 --> 01:36:51,972
Why Paul..
- Get lost, Fateh!

2490
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:54,451
Please go.

2491
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:08,255
What is it?

2492
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:11,833
What are you trying to do?

2493
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,668
What's this?

2494
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,269
The weapon of my looks.

2495
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:23,470
What?

2496
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:26,640
The weapon of my looks.

2497
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:30,010
The weapon of..

2498
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:34,348
Oh. my God!

2499
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:36,617
I'm trying to cheer you up and you're laughing at me.

2500
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:39,153
What was that?

2501
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:55,169
Okay, then I won't try to pacify you either.

2502
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:57,004
Fateh.

2503
01:37:57,004 --> 01:37:58,973
Fateh.

2504
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:00,897
Fateh, listen to me.

2505
01:38:00,923 --> 01:38:02,243
- What is it?

2506
01:38:02,243 --> 01:38:04,845
You were right.

2507
01:38:04,845 --> 01:38:08,182
All men are not the same.

2508
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:11,685
Some are like you too.

2509
01:38:11,685 --> 01:38:13,087
Yes. I'm an idiot.

2510
01:38:13,087 --> 01:38:15,322
No.

2511
01:38:15,322 --> 01:38:18,259
My love.

2512
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:27,368
Thank you, constable.

2513
01:38:27,368 --> 01:38:40,681
It's okay, constable.

2514
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:42,983
Constable.

2515
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:45,786
Your hand.

2516
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:51,025
Yes, it's mine.

2517
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:53,127
You are not going to take it with you.

2518
01:38:53,127 --> 01:39:01,235
Let the eyes look at each other.

2519
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:07,541
Let the one who's dying, breathe.

2520
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:11,712
Let the eyes look at each other.

2521
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:15,416
Let the one who's dying, breathe.

2522
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:19,453
I want you to be close to me.

2523
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:23,557
I forget all my sorrows when I see you.

2524
01:39:23,557 --> 01:39:30,264
Let my heart say what it wants to.

2525
01:39:30,264 --> 01:39:34,368
Let the eyes look at each other.

2526
01:39:34,368 --> 01:39:39,373
Let the one who's dying, breathe.

2527
01:39:39,373 --> 01:39:45,312
The eyes.

2528
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:54,688
The eyes.

2529
01:39:54,688 --> 01:40:04,531
I dreamt near your dreams.

2530
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:13,273
I dreamt near your dreams.

2531
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:21,615
I forgot the beauty of the world when I saw you.

2532
01:40:21,615 --> 01:40:25,786
Don't ever forget me.

2533
01:40:25,786 --> 01:40:29,890
I live for you.

2534
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:36,597
Let my heart say what it wants to.

2535
01:40:36,597 --> 01:40:40,768
Let the eyes look at each other.

2536
01:40:40,768 --> 01:41:02,790
Let the one who's dying, breathe.

2537
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:06,794
I'm your shadow.

2538
01:41:06,794 --> 01:41:13,067
I'll always follow you.

2539
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:17,204
I'm your shadow.

2540
01:41:17,204 --> 01:41:21,341
I'll always follow you.

2541
01:41:21,341 --> 01:41:29,550
I always pray that you never go away from me.

2542
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:33,821
My emotions are attached to you.

2543
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:37,758
My life is dedicated to you.

2544
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:44,731
Let my heart say what it wants to.

2545
01:41:44,731 --> 01:41:48,802
Let the eyes look at each other.

2546
01:41:48,802 --> 01:41:53,707
Let the one who's dying, breathe.

2547
01:41:53,707 --> 01:41:55,809
The eyes.

2548
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:57,311
Mother!

2549
01:41:57,311 --> 01:41:59,480
Mother!

2550
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,148
Mother!

2551
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:04,952
Let the eyes look at each other.

2552
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:08,839
Let the one who's dying, breathe.

2553
01:42:25,839 --> 01:42:26,707
I caught you!

2554
01:42:26,707 --> 01:42:31,654
How will you escape from me?

2555
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,481
God bless you.

2556
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:37,602
Hey. you?

2557
01:42:37,628 --> 01:42:42,456
How are you?

2558
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:44,258
What did you say?

2559
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:47,227
You and the constable?

2560
01:42:47,227 --> 01:42:51,131
Naughty boy!

2561
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:52,850
You'll get into trouble someday, silly.

2562
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:53,600
I'm telling you.

2563
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,203
Why? She's the DC's daughter.

2564
01:42:56,203 --> 01:42:58,539
You should have at least seen your face before falling for her.

2565
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:01,542
It is useless.

2566
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:02,778
No, no, no.
Turn your face.

2567
01:43:02,804 --> 01:43:03,877
You should be slapped.

2568
01:43:03,877 --> 01:43:06,644
You should be slapped.

2569
01:43:06,670 --> 01:43:08,782
Turn your face.

2570
01:43:08,782 --> 01:43:09,516
Rascal.

2571
01:43:09,516 --> 01:43:11,852
You should have thought before using the weapon of your looks.

2572
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:14,721
She is imported whiskey and you are local liquor.

2573
01:43:14,721 --> 01:43:18,292
There's no comparison between you two.

2574
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:20,260
What?

2575
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,662
Love doesn't think about all this?

2576
01:43:21,662 --> 01:43:25,246
I'll flail you if you lie!

2577
01:43:25,272 --> 01:43:26,900
You lover!

2578
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:29,375
What does flail mean?

2579
01:43:29,401 --> 01:43:32,439
Why do you want to know?

2580
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:34,474
You were a liar. You are a liar.

2581
01:43:34,474 --> 01:43:35,470
You lied at home.

2582
01:43:35,496 --> 01:43:36,877
You made a false case.

2583
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:38,946
You lied to the girl and used your weapon of looks.

2584
01:43:38,946 --> 01:43:43,183
If you had lied so many times, then
you should have loved her falsely too.

2585
01:43:43,183 --> 01:43:49,590
No, why did you fall in love with her truly?

2586
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:51,797
Tell the truth to the girl?

2587
01:43:51,823 --> 01:43:52,859
Everything?

2588
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:55,996
So you two just decided and didn't even bother to ask me.

2589
01:43:55,996 --> 01:43:58,065
Tell her. Tell her tomorrow.

2590
01:43:58,065 --> 01:44:00,653
Tell the truth.

2591
01:44:00,679 --> 01:44:05,138
You'll get into trouble.

2592
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:07,374
Why did you call us, Inspector?

2593
01:44:07,374 --> 01:44:08,811
Here's your passport.

2594
01:44:08,837 --> 01:44:10,043
Get out of here.

2595
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:11,111
My passport!

2596
01:44:11,137 --> 01:44:13,780
The visa hasn't expired yet.

2597
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:17,017
Inspector, we don't have Rs. 50,000.

2598
01:44:17,017 --> 01:44:18,819
I don't want your stinky money.

2599
01:44:18,819 --> 01:44:22,389
Get a ticket for yourself and fly to Canada.

2600
01:44:22,389 --> 01:44:26,159
The Punjab Police are being merciful towards us.

2601
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:28,128
My dear son, I don't believe this.

2602
01:44:28,128 --> 01:44:30,130
Father, I don't believe it either.

2603
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:33,200
Your dear son isn't so lucky.

2604
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:36,169
I feel like this is a dream.

2605
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:39,206
Let's touch the inspector and see.
- Yes. Yes.

2606
01:44:39,206 --> 01:44:43,477
Inspector, can I pinch you?

2607
01:44:43,477 --> 01:44:44,845
Your dear son was slapped once!

2608
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:50,517
It's real. It's real. One more.

2609
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:53,099
Your dear son was slapped twice!

2610
01:44:53,125 --> 01:44:54,955
It's real! It's real!

2611
01:44:54,955 --> 01:45:01,395
Now your dear son will go to Canada
and send PP shoes from there for sir.

2612
01:45:01,395 --> 01:45:02,996
PP? You mean Punjab Police?

2613
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:03,950
No, sir.

2614
01:45:03,976 --> 01:45:07,768
The ones that make a sound when you wear them.

2615
01:45:07,768 --> 01:45:09,569
Get lost. - Those.

2616
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:11,919
Thanks a lot, sir.

2617
01:45:11,945 --> 01:45:14,007
Love you, sir!

2618
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:15,776
Your dear son was slapped thrice!

2619
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:18,078
Before I change my mood, get out of here!

2620
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:20,280
Yes, sir. Let's go.
Let's go.

2621
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:21,668
Wait a minute.

2622
01:45:21,694 --> 01:45:23,850
Take this. Rs. 1100.

2623
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:25,185
A gift? - It's not a gift.

2624
01:45:25,185 --> 01:45:27,876
It's for not telling anyone about what happened here.

2625
01:45:27,902 --> 01:45:28,922
Get lost!
-Yes, sir.

2626
01:45:28,922 --> 01:45:32,726
Come, son. Come.

2627
01:45:32,726 --> 01:45:34,294
Sir, you let them go so easily?

2628
01:45:34,294 --> 01:45:37,130
We don't let our family members go without bribe.

2629
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,865
And you gave them their passport back free of cost.

2630
01:45:38,865 --> 01:45:41,601
Idiot, this is Inspector Joginder Singh's plan.

2631
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:43,070
You don't get three stars without a reason.

2632
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:47,007
Yes, sir.
I know that you need to pin them up.

2633
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:48,809
When you want to ask God for money..

2634
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:50,944
...you need to offer Him some money first.

2635
01:45:50,944 --> 01:45:53,814
Now let me see how Fateh Singh brings Pooja to Punjab.

2636
01:45:53,814 --> 01:45:56,483
Canada.

2637
01:45:56,483 --> 01:46:05,459
Canada.

2638
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:09,896
Canada.

2639
01:46:09,896 --> 01:46:13,500
Canada.

2640
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:20,173
Father, your dear son has finally reached Canada!

2641
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:22,008
Father, look. Look.

2642
01:46:22,008 --> 01:46:23,115
The long sky.

2643
01:46:23,141 --> 01:46:26,179
The pigeons are flying in the sky.

2644
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:31,351
Father, your dear son had your good wishes and God's blessings.

2645
01:46:31,351 --> 01:46:34,521
This is God's gift to me.

2646
01:46:34,521 --> 01:46:44,598
So, your dear son will first greet this great land of Canada.

2647
01:46:44,598 --> 01:46:48,635
Canada. I, Shampy, salute you on behalf of..

2648
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:53,006
...Shampy's father and Shampy's scooter.

2649
01:46:53,006 --> 01:46:53,749
Don't move.

2650
01:46:53,775 --> 01:46:55,976
Police, freeze! Police, freeze!

2651
01:46:55,976 --> 01:46:58,378
Canada.

2652
01:46:58,378 --> 01:47:00,480
I've got security.

2653
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:06,920
Respected sir, I have never even smuggled snacks in India.

2654
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,423
How can I smuggle drugs in Canada?

2655
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:11,591
I swear on Shampy's vehicle.

2656
01:47:11,591 --> 01:47:13,527
Shampy's what?

2657
01:47:13,527 --> 01:47:18,298
Vehicle. Shampy's vehicle.

2658
01:47:18,298 --> 01:47:19,860
Come to Punjab some time.

2659
01:47:19,886 --> 01:47:21,735
I will give you a free ride.

2660
01:47:21,735 --> 01:47:23,136
Shut up.

2661
01:47:23,136 --> 01:47:27,541
Respected madam, you may slap me as many times as you want..

2662
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:29,910
"But I will surely say something.

2663
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:31,762
I'm not a smuggler.

2664
01:47:31,788 --> 01:47:33,613
I'm not. I'm not.

2665
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:35,715
You won't agree so easily.

2666
01:47:35,715 --> 01:47:39,152
We'll have to use Fateh's techniques on you.

2667
01:47:39,152 --> 01:47:42,122
Fateh? From the Punjab Police?

2668
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:44,758
That idiot didn't leave me alone even over here!

2669
01:47:44,758 --> 01:47:45,749
Do you know him?

2670
01:47:45,775 --> 01:47:46,493
- Know him?

2671
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:48,762
He has brought ill luck into my life.

2672
01:47:48,762 --> 01:47:50,106
I was native-ve.

2673
01:47:50,132 --> 01:47:51,449
I was innocent.

2674
01:47:51,475 --> 01:47:53,633
But Fateh imprisoned me.

2675
01:47:53,633 --> 01:47:56,636
He stopped me from coming to Canada.

2676
01:47:56,636 --> 01:48:00,373
I think he has made this false case against me.

2677
01:48:00,373 --> 01:48:01,708
What nonsense are you talking?

2678
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:05,245
The dear son was slapped twice.
Why?

2679
01:48:05,245 --> 01:48:07,414
Liar. In order to hide your crime..

2680
01:48:07,414 --> 01:48:09,983
...you're falsely accusing an honest officer?

2681
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:13,854
No, respected madam. I never lie.

2682
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:15,856
It's a sin to lie.

2683
01:48:15,856 --> 01:48:17,791
You don't believe me, do you?

2684
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:18,585
Do one thing.

2685
01:48:18,611 --> 01:48:21,761
Call his senior officer Joginder Singh and ask him.

2686
01:48:21,761 --> 01:48:25,966
Everything will be clear.

2687
01:48:25,966 --> 01:48:27,901
So, Singh, what do you think?

2688
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:29,516
I don't believe him, sir.

2689
01:48:29,542 --> 01:48:30,937
Why would Fateh lie?

2690
01:48:30,937 --> 01:48:32,906
But still, what's the harm in making one phone call?

2691
01:48:32,906 --> 01:48:36,276
Yes. - Okay, sir.

2692
01:48:36,276 --> 01:48:38,845
If what you're saying about Fateh is a lie..

2693
01:48:38,845 --> 01:48:43,083
"Then I won't spare you.
Dear son.

2694
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:47,721
The dear son was slapped thrice.

2695
01:48:47,721 --> 01:48:49,456
Never mind, Shampy.

2696
01:48:49,456 --> 01:48:54,461
Earlier you would be slapped in India, and now, in Canada.

2697
01:48:54,461 --> 01:48:58,431
At least you're progressing.

2698
01:48:58,431 --> 01:49:01,234
Miss you, father.

2699
01:49:01,234 --> 01:49:05,038
Shampy?
A smuggler?

2700
01:49:05,038 --> 01:49:07,236
Shampy is not a man.

2701
01:49:07,262 --> 01:49:08,775
He's a saint.

2702
01:49:08,775 --> 01:49:11,711
I've conducted a police verification of him myself.

2703
01:49:11,711 --> 01:49:14,114
But he's saying that Fateh has prepared a false case against him.

2704
01:49:14,114 --> 01:49:15,695
He's telling the truth.

2705
01:49:15,721 --> 01:49:17,551
Fateh is a very big liar.

2706
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:19,986
The department is doing an inquiry against him.

2707
01:49:19,986 --> 01:49:22,022
The DCP was telling me once..

2708
01:49:22,022 --> 01:49:25,125
That he is in India and his family is in Canada..

2709
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:27,027
...and he wished someone could..

2710
01:49:27,027 --> 01:49:29,195
...bring his family here from Canada.

2711
01:49:29,195 --> 01:49:34,901
He heard that, made a false case and went there.

2712
01:49:34,901 --> 01:49:39,306
Do I need to sign here?

2713
01:49:39,306 --> 01:49:40,173
Thank you.

2714
01:49:40,173 --> 01:49:41,908
Mark, where's Pooja?

2715
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:43,944
Holding room, end of the hall.

2716
01:49:43,944 --> 01:49:45,512
In the last one? - Yes.

2717
01:49:45,512 --> 01:49:47,102
Okay.

2718
01:49:47,128 --> 01:49:50,917
Thank you.

2719
01:49:50,943 --> 01:49:53,620
- Sure.

2720
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:55,894
Pooja.

2721
01:50:00,894 --> 01:50:02,362
You're here?

2722
01:50:02,388 --> 01:50:05,298
I was looking for you.

2723
01:50:05,298 --> 01:50:07,367
I wanted to talk to you about something important.

2724
01:50:07,367 --> 01:50:09,258
Me too.

2725
01:50:09,284 --> 01:50:13,039
- What is it?

2726
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:19,512
First promise me that after this,
you'll quietly do what I ask you to.

2727
01:50:19,512 --> 01:50:20,561
How can I promise you?

2728
01:50:20,587 --> 01:50:22,182
I wonder what you might ask for.

2729
01:50:22,182 --> 01:50:25,485
Why? Are you scared?

2730
01:50:25,485 --> 01:50:27,687
If that is the case,
then ask for my life.

2731
01:50:27,687 --> 01:50:29,689
You'll see my guts.

2732
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:50,110
Let's promise.

2733
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:50,710
Get out.

2734
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:54,114
But Pooja, I.. -Just shut up.

2735
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:56,216
I don't believe anything that you say.

2736
01:50:56,216 --> 01:50:58,418
Because you're a bloody liar.

2737
01:50:58,418 --> 01:51:02,689
If you have any shame left, then don't break your promise.

2738
01:51:02,689 --> 01:51:04,024
Just leave quietly.

2739
01:51:04,024 --> 01:51:17,450
At least give me a chance..

2740
01:51:17,476 --> 01:51:34,854
- Just get out of my life, Fateh!

2741
01:51:34,854 --> 01:51:40,326
Fateh Singh.

2742
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:44,030
I didn't expect this from you.

2743
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:47,100
These are your deportation orders.

2744
01:51:47,100 --> 01:52:20,433
By the end of this week, you'll be sent back to India.

2745
01:52:20,433 --> 01:52:21,729
Oh, gosh!

2746
01:52:21,755 --> 01:52:26,339
Whose call is it at this time?

2747
01:52:26,339 --> 01:52:27,707
Hello.

2748
01:52:27,707 --> 01:52:28,186
Hello, mother.

2749
01:52:28,212 --> 01:52:29,042
Give me your blessings.

2750
01:52:29,042 --> 01:52:32,312
Fateh! My sweetheart!

2751
01:52:32,338 --> 01:52:35,115
My baby! My son!

2752
01:52:35,115 --> 01:52:36,549
How are you, son?

2753
01:52:36,549 --> 01:52:37,264
I'm fine, mother.

2754
01:52:37,290 --> 01:52:37,800
You tell me.

2755
01:52:37,826 --> 01:52:38,651
Are you all right?

2756
01:52:38,651 --> 01:52:40,820
How can a mother be without her son?

2757
01:52:40,820 --> 01:52:42,655
My knees were paining since two days.

2758
01:52:42,655 --> 01:52:46,292
Now that you've called, I can dance now.

2759
01:52:46,292 --> 01:52:48,361
Mother, I was so busy that I couldn't call earlier.

2760
01:52:48,361 --> 01:52:54,300
If an inspector won't be busy, then
do you expect constables to be busy?

2761
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,569
No, mother. Even constables have a lot of work to do.

2762
01:52:56,569 --> 01:53:01,074
All nonsense!

2763
01:53:01,074 --> 01:53:04,244
Mother, what if I told you that I
didn't work when I was a constable?

2764
01:53:04,244 --> 01:53:08,515
Son, whatever work you do, you must do it dedicatedly.

2765
01:53:08,515 --> 01:53:15,688
As an inspector.

2766
01:53:15,688 --> 01:53:17,791
But what if there is lie on your mind, mother?

2767
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:19,993
Then you can't do anything properly.

2768
01:53:19,993 --> 01:53:22,395
God doesn't help those who lie.

2769
01:53:22,395 --> 01:53:26,966
He just sits far away and watches the fun.

2770
01:53:26,966 --> 01:53:28,744
What's the matter, son?

2771
01:53:28,770 --> 01:53:29,903
You're quiet?

2772
01:53:29,903 --> 01:53:32,839
And you are saying such things.

2773
01:53:32,839 --> 01:53:34,707
There will be a load on you, son.

2774
01:53:34,707 --> 01:53:36,075
Mother, I've lied.

2775
01:53:36,075 --> 01:53:37,324
So what?

2776
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:39,979
I lie everyday.

2777
01:53:39,979 --> 01:53:42,882
In the morning, your father asked me to make tea.

2778
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:44,651
I didn't feel like waking up.

2779
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:47,854
So, I lied to him that I had a headache.

2780
01:53:47,854 --> 01:53:48,708
Mother, not like that.

2781
01:53:48,734 --> 01:53:49,756
I've told a very big lie.

2782
01:53:49,756 --> 01:53:52,741
A big one?

2783
01:53:52,767 --> 01:53:55,428
How big?

2784
01:53:55,428 --> 01:53:59,113
Mother, I'm not an inspector.

2785
01:53:59,139 --> 01:54:01,401
I'm a constable.

2786
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:04,304
Mother, I know that you must have felt very bad.

2787
01:54:04,304 --> 01:54:06,406
But I felt that I must tell the truth.

2788
01:54:06,406 --> 01:54:09,676
I did feel bad that you lied.

2789
01:54:09,676 --> 01:54:12,378
But I'm happy that you told the truth.

2790
01:54:12,378 --> 01:54:14,948
That my son has become wise.

2791
01:54:14,948 --> 01:54:21,788
Anyone can be an inspector, but very few can be wise.

2792
01:54:21,788 --> 01:54:26,593
If you tell the truth, then God will always be by your side.

2793
01:54:26,593 --> 01:54:27,861
Thank you, mother.

2794
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:31,664
You shouldn't thank your mother.

2795
01:54:31,664 --> 01:54:33,161
Okay, hang up now.

2796
01:54:33,187 --> 01:54:36,736
l too want to tell your father the truth.

2797
01:54:36,736 --> 01:54:40,209
Okay, mother.

2798
01:54:40,235 --> 01:54:41,812
Bye.

2799
01:54:41,838 --> 01:54:45,478
- Bless you.

2800
01:54:45,478 --> 01:54:48,615
Listen!
- Tell me.

2801
01:54:48,615 --> 01:55:10,169
Should I make tea?

2802
01:55:10,169 --> 01:55:11,608
Hi. No, wait, Pooja.

2803
01:55:11,634 --> 01:55:12,790
Please. Please.

2804
01:55:12,816 --> 01:55:13,406
Please.

2805
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:17,977
Just give me one chance to say what I came to say.

2806
01:55:17,977 --> 01:55:20,847
Thank you. Thank you.

2807
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:22,482
Chris, not another note.. - No, no.

2808
01:55:22,482 --> 01:55:23,959
Just last one.

2809
01:55:23,985 --> 01:55:26,386
Just let me say this.

2810
01:55:26,386 --> 01:55:29,289
Pooja, I made a mistake.

2811
01:55:29,289 --> 01:55:32,859
So, please forgive me.

2812
01:55:32,859 --> 01:55:36,129
And if it makes you happy, let alone..

2813
01:55:36,129 --> 01:55:38,398
...your mother and granny..

2814
01:55:38,398 --> 01:55:46,506
...I am willing to stay even with the dogs of your lane.

2815
01:55:46,506 --> 01:55:48,478
I am a fool.

2816
01:55:48,504 --> 01:55:53,079
An idiot. A.. - Scoundrel.

2817
01:55:53,079 --> 01:55:54,317
Yes. Yes.

2818
01:55:54,343 --> 01:55:58,718
A scoundrel.
A rascal. Stupid"

2819
01:55:58,718 --> 01:56:01,688
A stupid man. - A stupid man.

2820
01:56:01,688 --> 01:56:04,250
Yes. A stupid man.

2821
01:56:04,276 --> 01:56:08,661
- Chris, who wrote this note?

2822
01:56:08,661 --> 01:56:10,296
It doesn't matter who wrote it.

2823
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:13,399
What matters is that I want to start a new life with you.

2824
01:56:13,399 --> 01:56:14,567
Pooja.

2825
01:56:14,567 --> 01:56:16,486
No! - Pooja, please.

2826
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:18,404
Will you marry me?

2827
01:56:18,404 --> 01:56:19,973
Pooja, please.

2828
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:20,555
Please say yes.

2829
01:56:20,581 --> 01:56:21,641
I'll do anything you want.

2830
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:23,076
Chris, I..

2831
01:56:23,076 --> 01:56:36,289
Please say yes. Please.

2832
01:56:36,289 --> 01:56:40,727
Yes.

2833
01:56:40,727 --> 01:56:43,262
Yes! Thank you, Pooja.

2834
01:56:43,288 --> 01:56:44,530
Thank you.

2835
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:45,765
But I have a condition.

2836
01:56:45,765 --> 01:56:49,135
What are you saying?

2837
01:56:49,135 --> 01:56:52,638
I want the wedding to happen soon.

2838
01:56:52,638 --> 01:56:53,873
Really soon.

2839
01:56:53,873 --> 01:56:54,817
Really soon.

2840
01:56:54,843 --> 01:56:58,277
You want the wedding to be soon.
How soon?

2841
01:56:58,277 --> 01:57:01,581
This week.

2842
01:57:35,581 --> 01:57:43,056
My heart has brought so many complaints.

2843
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:44,941
It's autumn.

2844
01:57:44,967 --> 01:57:50,596
The leaves have fallen on flowers.

2845
01:57:50,596 --> 01:57:54,333
My heart has brought so many complaints.

2846
01:57:54,333 --> 01:57:55,593
It's autumn.

2847
01:57:55,619 --> 01:57:59,372
The leaves have fallen on flowers.

2848
01:57:59,372 --> 01:58:05,545
When my heart broke, I learnt that.

2849
01:58:05,545 --> 01:58:07,464
I'm shedding tears.

2850
01:58:07,490 --> 01:58:09,282
I'm heartbroken.

2851
01:58:09,282 --> 01:58:13,052
Your dreams have called out to me.

2852
01:58:13,052 --> 01:58:14,988
I'm shedding tears.

2853
01:58:15,014 --> 01:58:16,823
I'm heartbroken.

2854
01:58:16,823 --> 01:58:20,560
What's my fault?

2855
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,479
I'm shedding tears.

2856
01:58:22,505 --> 01:58:24,297
I'm heartbroken.

2857
01:58:24,297 --> 01:58:44,984
Your dreams have called out to me.

2858
01:58:44,984 --> 01:58:46,853
When you left my hand..

2859
01:58:46,853 --> 01:58:52,492
...I felt as if I was separated from my destiny.

2860
01:58:52,492 --> 01:58:55,895
God made us a couple..

2861
01:58:55,895 --> 01:59:07,440
"But we separated on your will.

2862
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:09,375
When you left my hand..

2863
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:14,914
...I felt as if I was separated from my destiny.

2864
01:59:14,914 --> 01:59:18,518
God made us a couple..

2865
01:59:18,518 --> 01:59:22,655
"But we separated on your will.

2866
01:59:22,655 --> 01:59:24,524
Your intentions were false.

2867
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:26,392
Your promises were false.

2868
01:59:26,392 --> 01:59:30,830
Loyalty is weeping.

2869
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:34,600
Pooja dear, I wanted to talk to you.

2870
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,702
Yes, mother?

2871
01:59:36,702 --> 01:59:39,485
Dear, if you could think about it again..

2872
01:59:39,511 --> 01:59:41,407
- Mother, don't start again.

2873
01:59:41,407 --> 01:59:46,445
Look, dear, I agree that Fateh had lied, but"

2874
01:59:46,445 --> 01:59:51,851
But because of his lie, if you had met your father once..

2875
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:55,521
...then there was nothing wrong in it.

2876
01:59:55,521 --> 01:59:59,158
Mother, you're saying this?

2877
01:59:59,158 --> 02:00:02,094
You've not spoken to father since 18 years.

2878
02:00:02,094 --> 02:00:07,066
You didn't let me talk to him either.

2879
02:00:07,066 --> 02:00:13,806
Dear, sometimes stubbornness becomes more..

2880
02:00:13,806 --> 02:00:15,478
...Important than words.

...because of which you repent for
the rest of your life, like I did.

2903

Dear, there's no place for stubbornness in love.

2904
02:00:39,865 --> 02:00:42,368
I know what I'm doing, mother.

2905
02:00:42,368 --> 02:00:47,206
At least Chris is not a liar.

2906
02:00:47,206 --> 02:00:49,141
I'm shedding..

2907
02:00:49,141 --> 02:00:51,010
I'm shedding..

Your dreams have called out to me.

I'm shedding tears.

2912

I'm heartbroken.

2913

What's my fault?

2914
02:01:05,925 --> 02:01:07,878
I'm shedding tears.

2915
02:01:07,904 --> 02:01:09,729
I'm heartbroken.

2916
02:01:09,729 --> 02:01:13,728
Your dreams have called out to me.

2917
02:01:42,728 --> 02:01:44,901
My father is great.

2918
02:01:48,901 --> 02:01:50,202
You?

2919
02:01:50,202 --> 02:01:52,772
Spare me in the bathroom at least.

2920
02:01:52,772 --> 02:01:55,574
How did I harm you..

2921
02:01:55,574 --> 02:01:59,145
...that you are after me all the time?

2922
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:00,513
Sorry, Shampy.
I made a mistake.

2923
02:02:00,513 --> 02:02:02,214
What sorry? No manners!

2924
02:02:02,214 --> 02:02:06,819
You know, to send me to Canada, Shampy's favorite father"

2925
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:09,622
...who never even let his beard open..

2926
02:02:09,622 --> 02:02:15,294
...he had to open the three buttons of his shirt and display his body.

2927
02:02:15,294 --> 02:02:18,783
And what was the result of all that?

2928
02:02:18,809 --> 02:02:21,400
I'm being deported today.

2929
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:22,266
I said I'm sorry.

2930
02:02:22,292 --> 02:02:23,336
Why are you crying?

2931
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:24,373
What sorry?

2932
02:02:24,399 --> 02:02:25,504
No manners!

2933
02:02:25,504 --> 02:02:28,174
You have left me to be doomed.

2934
02:02:28,174 --> 02:02:31,077
Why did you do this to an innocent boy?

2935
02:02:31,077 --> 02:02:34,780
Why? Why did you break my heart?
- Get lost.

2936
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:36,682
The dear son is slapped once.

2937
02:02:36,682 --> 02:02:38,212
You should've at least washed your hands first"

2938
02:02:38,238 --> 02:02:38,818
-I said I'm sorry!

2939
02:02:38,818 --> 02:02:39,785
You are going on crying.

2940
02:02:39,785 --> 02:02:41,654
Your dream is shattered, but I'm heartbroken.

2941
02:02:41,654 --> 02:02:43,723
You call yourself an innocent boy.

2942
02:02:43,723 --> 02:02:45,891
You should have washed that hand.

2943
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:47,563
Why did you tell the truth to Pooja?

2944
02:02:47,589 --> 02:02:49,328
I would have explained to her later.

2945
02:02:49,328 --> 02:02:50,963
You were trying to be a truthful man's son.

2946
02:02:50,963 --> 02:02:55,167
Brother, you may slap me as many times as you want.

2947
02:02:55,167 --> 02:02:58,070
But don't get my father's name wrong.

2948
02:02:58,070 --> 02:03:04,243
My father's name is Duntoshan Singh.

2949
02:03:04,243 --> 02:03:08,647
He has always taught me to tell the truth.

2950
02:03:08,647 --> 02:03:09,982
I'm sorry, Shampy.

2951
02:03:10,008 --> 02:03:11,984
I vented my anger on you.

2952
02:03:11,984 --> 02:03:13,652
If I had ever learnt to tell the truth in life..

2953
02:03:13,652 --> 02:03:17,490
...then instead of the foreigner, I would be marrying Pooja today.

2954
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:22,228
Brother, you really love the respected madam truly?

2955
02:03:22,228 --> 02:03:23,429
Yes.

2956
02:03:23,429 --> 02:03:28,801
Then you should be slapped at least a dozen times, brother.

2957
02:03:28,801 --> 02:03:33,906
I mean, brother, if your love is sweet and pure like Shampy..

2958
02:03:33,906 --> 02:03:37,643
...then you must pacify the respected madam anyhow.

2959
02:03:37,643 --> 02:03:42,148
And you must fly along with her.

2960
02:03:42,148 --> 02:03:43,449
Listen to me, brother.

2961
02:03:43,449 --> 02:03:47,586
Look, it's very easy to earn a dollar which is equal to Rs. 55.

2962
02:03:47,586 --> 02:03:51,056
But it's very difficult to earn a girl who is equal to true love.

2963
02:03:51,056 --> 02:03:54,760
Brother, you're leaving the wealth of love here and going?

2964
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:56,465
Shame. Shame. Shame on you.

2965
02:03:56,491 --> 02:03:58,297
Shame on you. Shame. Shame.

2966
02:03:58,297 --> 02:04:00,833
You have a point, Shampy.

2967
02:04:00,833 --> 02:04:04,637
But how do you know so much about love?

2968
02:04:04,637 --> 02:04:10,910
Brother, actually, my name is Loveoshan Singh.

2969
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:15,281
You mean to say that I should go and stop Pooja's wedding?

2970
02:04:15,281 --> 02:04:17,950
Absolutely, brother. What else?

2971
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:24,256
The two policemen, who are standing
here, take care of them somehow.

2972
02:04:24,256 --> 02:04:28,227
Shampy is with you.

2973
02:04:28,227 --> 02:04:31,397
It looks like it's time to use the biggest weapon of the Punjab Police.

2974
02:04:31,397 --> 02:04:33,299
Weapon?

2975
02:04:33,299 --> 02:04:36,135
Hail the Lord!

2976
02:04:36,135 --> 02:04:39,672
Hail!

2977
02:04:39,672 --> 02:04:41,907
Brother" - What's wrong?

2978
02:04:41,907 --> 02:04:44,977
Brother, we need your help.

2979
02:04:44,977 --> 02:04:45,612
Hello, base.

2980
02:04:45,638 --> 02:04:47,146
We need back up right away.

2981
02:04:47,146 --> 02:04:49,648
Back up. Back up right away.

2982
02:04:49,648 --> 02:04:52,117
Run! Run! Taxi.

2983
02:04:52,117 --> 02:04:53,118
Stop! Stop!

2984
02:04:53,118 --> 02:04:55,387
You?
I've told you so many times that Indians and..

2985
02:04:55,387 --> 02:04:57,122
Brother, please don't bring up that issue today.

2986
02:04:57,122 --> 02:04:58,157
It's about my love.

2987
02:04:58,157 --> 02:05:00,593
If I don't reach there on time, then she'll marry someone else.

2988
02:05:00,593 --> 02:05:04,196
Look, brother, if you don't help us, then love will lose.

2989
02:05:04,196 --> 02:05:06,198
And if love loses, then God will lose.

2990
02:05:06,198 --> 02:05:08,267
Because love is God and God is great.

2991
02:05:08,267 --> 02:05:12,137
If that's the matter, then neither are you Indian, nor am I Pakistani.

2992
02:05:12,137 --> 02:05:15,007
We're all brothers.
Get in.

2993
02:05:15,007 --> 02:05:27,855
Get in, Shampy.
Get in.

2994
02:05:27,881 --> 02:05:32,324
Get in.

2995
02:05:32,324 --> 02:05:34,927
Get out.

2996
02:05:34,927 --> 02:05:36,295
Thank you, brother.
- Okay.

2997
02:05:36,295 --> 02:05:38,597
Shampy, there is police here.

2998
02:05:38,597 --> 02:05:39,932
Brother, don't worry.

2999
02:05:39,932 --> 02:05:41,535
You go and meet her from there.

3000
02:05:41,561 --> 02:05:43,035
Shampy will take care here.

3001
02:05:43,035 --> 02:05:46,672
Sure? - Sure.

3002
02:05:46,672 --> 02:05:49,241
We are not even getting overtime.

3003
02:05:49,241 --> 02:05:50,743
Excuse me, brother.

3004
02:05:50,743 --> 02:05:52,278
The dacoit Shampy!

3005
02:05:52,278 --> 02:05:54,413
Hold! Hold! Hold! Hold!

3006
02:05:54,413 --> 02:05:58,651
Brother, Shampy won't be scared of this weapon.

3007
02:05:58,651 --> 02:06:01,520
Shampy has a bigger weapon.

3008
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:07,960
Hail the Lord!

3009
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:09,361
Hail.

3010
02:06:09,361 --> 02:06:10,763
There's no one here to help.

3011
02:06:10,763 --> 02:06:13,766
Looks like I'll be slapped now.

3012
02:06:13,766 --> 02:06:14,547
Catch me if you can!

3013
02:06:14,573 --> 02:06:15,367
- Get him! Get him!

3014
02:06:15,367 --> 02:06:16,869
God, help me.

3015
02:06:16,869 --> 02:06:19,738
Pooja, Chris, please join your hands..

3016
02:06:19,738 --> 02:06:22,675
...and declare your consent in front of God.

3017
02:06:22,675 --> 02:06:24,009
Do you have the rings?

3018
02:06:24,009 --> 02:06:26,712
Rings?

3019
02:06:26,712 --> 02:06:29,214
Oh, it's their engagement today.

3020
02:06:29,214 --> 02:06:33,218
I was going crazy thinking they were getting married.

3021
02:06:33,218 --> 02:06:38,023
I will talk to her later.

3022
02:06:38,023 --> 02:06:41,157
Wait till I get my hands on you.

3023
02:06:41,183 --> 02:06:42,528
- Catch him!

3024
02:06:42,528 --> 02:06:44,463
You?

3025
02:06:44,463 --> 02:06:46,065
What are you doing here?

3026
02:06:46,065 --> 02:06:47,700
I had come to stop Pooja's wedding.

3027
02:06:47,726 --> 02:06:49,101
But they're getting engaged.

3028
02:06:49,101 --> 02:06:50,669
Idiot, this is not their engagement.

3029
02:06:50,669 --> 02:06:55,841
Exchanging the rings means getting married.

3030
02:06:55,841 --> 02:06:57,676
You're lying.

3031
02:06:57,676 --> 02:06:59,144
I'm telling the truth.

3032
02:06:59,170 --> 02:07:01,614
This is how foreigners get married.

3033
02:07:01,614 --> 02:07:07,886
Crazy BOY-

3034
02:07:07,886 --> 02:07:09,288
Stop! Stop! Stop!

3035
02:07:09,288 --> 02:07:10,990
Stop it right now.

3036
02:07:10,990 --> 02:07:12,925
You?
Who are you to stop us?

3037
02:07:12,925 --> 02:07:13,741
Pooja, don't say that.

3038
02:07:13,767 --> 02:07:14,927
I've come to apologize to you.

3039
02:07:14,927 --> 02:07:18,564
I agree that I've told you many lies, but I love you truly.

3040
02:07:18,564 --> 02:07:19,219
Oh, shut up!

3041
02:07:19,245 --> 02:07:20,966
I don't care.
Get out of here.

3042
02:07:20,966 --> 02:07:22,067
Let me get married in peace.

3043
02:07:22,067 --> 02:07:23,936
This means I won't be forgiven if I lied.

3044
02:07:23,936 --> 02:07:26,405
He lied to you and you're marrying him.

3045
02:07:26,405 --> 02:07:27,640
It doesn't look nice.

3046
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:28,604
What nonsense are you talking?

3047
02:07:28,630 --> 02:07:29,375
What did he lie about?

3048
02:07:29,375 --> 02:07:31,343
He's not going to accept your family after your marriage.

3049
02:07:31,343 --> 02:07:33,245
He got the false note written to make you agree.

3050
02:07:33,245 --> 02:07:34,680
I had written that note.

3051
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:37,049
If you feel that I'll consider your lie the truth"

3052
02:07:37,049 --> 02:07:38,984
...and won't marry Chris, then you're wrong.

3053
02:07:38,984 --> 02:07:40,686
Chris. - Wait!

3054
02:07:40,686 --> 02:07:41,654
Pooja, I'm telling you.

3055
02:07:41,654 --> 02:07:42,821
If the Punjab Police's friendship is good..

3056
02:07:42,821 --> 02:07:44,256
...then their animosity is worse than anything.

3057
02:07:44,256 --> 02:07:45,564
Really? What will you do?

3058
02:07:45,590 --> 02:07:46,558
What will you do?

3059
02:07:46,558 --> 02:07:48,827
You're threatening me.

3060
02:07:48,827 --> 02:07:53,198
Chris.

3061
02:07:53,198 --> 02:07:53,832
What are you doing?

3062
02:07:53,858 --> 02:07:54,833
- What are you doing, Fateh?

3063
02:07:54,833 --> 02:07:56,635
Don't interfere! I'll flail you!

3064
02:07:56,635 --> 02:07:57,674
Flail? What's that?

3065
02:07:57,700 --> 02:07:59,204
- Why do you want to know?

3066
02:07:59,204 --> 02:08:02,115
Just keep quiet, Chris.

3067
02:08:02,141 --> 02:08:04,430
Give me the ring.

3068
02:08:04,456 --> 02:08:05,911
- I won't.

3069
02:08:05,911 --> 02:08:07,046
Fateh!

3070
02:08:07,046 --> 02:08:08,480
Pooja!

3071
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:10,582
Fateh!
- What's happening, father?

3072
02:08:10,582 --> 02:08:11,950
Dance.

3073
02:08:11,950 --> 02:08:14,620
Fateh! Fateh, give me my ring back.

3074
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,538
I will not.

3075
02:08:15,564 --> 02:08:18,290
Please forgive me first, Pooja.

3076
02:08:18,290 --> 02:08:19,373
Why should I forgive you?

3077
02:08:19,399 --> 02:08:20,759
- Because I've really changed.

3078
02:08:20,759 --> 02:08:23,028
You will never stop lying.

3079
02:08:23,028 --> 02:08:24,595
Pooja, I can swear if you want me to.

3080
02:08:24,621 --> 02:08:25,230
I've changed.

3081
02:08:25,230 --> 02:08:27,666
I'm ready to tell you all the truths of my life.

3082
02:08:27,666 --> 02:08:29,201
You can ask me whatever you want.

3083
02:08:29,201 --> 02:08:30,205
I'm not interested in your life.

3084
02:08:30,231 --> 02:08:30,769
Give me my ring!

3085
02:08:30,769 --> 02:08:33,906
Please forgive me.
- I..

3086
02:08:33,906 --> 02:08:35,315
Fateh, give me my ring back.

3087
02:08:35,341 --> 02:08:36,775
- Pooja, please forgive me.

3088
02:08:36,775 --> 02:08:37,952
Fateh, give me my ring.

3089
02:08:37,978 --> 02:08:39,078
- Please forgive me.

3090
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:39,945
Fateh!

3091
02:08:39,945 --> 02:08:41,274
Give me my ring!

3092
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:43,682
- Drive the car.
- Give me!

3093
02:08:43,682 --> 02:08:44,563
Stop the car!

3094
02:08:44,589 --> 02:08:45,784
Give me my ring!

3095
02:08:45,784 --> 02:08:47,234
Listen to my truths, Pooja.

3096
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:49,221
- I don't want to hear your truths.

3097
02:08:49,221 --> 02:08:51,490
Okay, what if I told you that until the 4th class, I used to think..

3098
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:53,425
...that parents buy their children from the market..

3099
02:08:53,425 --> 02:08:55,260
...and that I was bought from the confectioner Lovely?

3100
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:57,262
Won't you still agree?
- No.

3101
02:08:57,262 --> 02:09:00,799
Okay, what if I tell you that I wear the same underwear twice?

3102
02:09:00,799 --> 02:09:02,267
Do you really think that.

3103
02:09:02,267 --> 02:09:04,303
...I would agree after listening to this and embrace you?

3104
02:09:04,303 --> 02:09:05,177
Please agree, Pooja.

3105
02:09:05,203 --> 02:09:06,138
I'll hug you myself.

3106
02:09:06,138 --> 02:09:07,339
Just shut up!

3107
02:09:07,339 --> 02:09:10,943
Okay, what if I tell you that my nickname is Topra?

3108
02:09:10,943 --> 02:09:13,746
You still won't agree?
- No.

3109
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:16,582
Okay, what if I tell you what 'flail' means?

3110
02:09:16,582 --> 02:09:19,017
Will you agree then? - No.

3111
02:09:19,017 --> 02:09:24,063
Think about it again, Pooja.

3112
02:09:24,089 --> 02:09:25,324
- No!

3113
02:09:25,324 --> 02:09:27,826
Please agree.

3114
02:09:27,826 --> 02:09:29,561
Okay. Tell me what it means.

3115
02:09:29,561 --> 02:09:30,462
Why should I tell you?

3116
02:09:30,462 --> 02:09:33,365
First tell me that you've forgiven me and you love me.

3117
02:09:33,365 --> 02:09:35,567
What? I love you?

3118
02:09:35,567 --> 02:09:37,636
You don't love me?
- Never.

3119
02:09:37,636 --> 02:09:38,937
Hey, you truthful woman!

3120
02:09:38,937 --> 02:09:40,839
You tell people to be truthful.

3121
02:09:40,839 --> 02:09:43,475
And now you're lying to me on purpose.

3122
02:09:43,475 --> 02:09:44,495
This is not a lie.

3123
02:09:44,521 --> 02:09:45,118
It's true.

3124
02:09:45,144 --> 02:09:47,045
I can never love a man like you.

3125
02:09:47,045 --> 02:09:48,663
Have you seen your face?

3126
02:09:48,689 --> 02:09:50,349
You look like an idiot.

3127
02:09:50,349 --> 02:09:53,318
Idiot?

3128
02:09:53,318 --> 02:09:54,173
Have you gone crazy?

3129
02:09:54,199 --> 02:09:55,754
I insulted you and you're laughing.

3130
02:09:55,754 --> 02:09:59,491
L.. Okay, you left your wedding, lied at the airport..

3131
02:09:59,491 --> 02:10:02,027
"Took special permissions for travelling without a passport.

3132
02:10:02,027 --> 02:10:05,397
As if you did all this not because you love this idiot..

3133
02:10:05,397 --> 02:10:07,533
"But because you want to know what 'flail' means.

3134
02:10:07,533 --> 02:10:09,902
You are very funny, constable.

3135
02:10:09,902 --> 02:10:11,214
You attacked the Punjab Police!

3136
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:11,637
But why?

3137
02:10:11,637 --> 02:10:13,071
You understood this very soon.

3138
02:10:13,071 --> 02:10:15,040
But you still didn't understand how to pacify someone who's upset.

3139
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:16,241
You didn't come to pacify instead.

3140
02:10:16,241 --> 02:10:17,743
Instead, you sent Chris with the note.

3141
02:10:17,743 --> 02:10:20,145
What if I had really married Chris in anger?

3142
02:10:20,145 --> 02:10:21,413
If I don't have the sense to pacify..

3143
02:10:21,413 --> 02:10:22,581
...then even you must know the limit of being upset.

3144
02:10:22,581 --> 02:10:24,817
You shouldn't insult the pacifier so much that he gives up.

3145
02:10:24,817 --> 02:10:26,385
What if I had not reached the church on time?

3146
02:10:26,385 --> 02:10:27,544
Then I would have married Chris.

3147
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:28,921
He's at least not an idiot like you.

3148
02:10:28,921 --> 02:10:29,835
Go and marry Chris.

3149
02:10:29,861 --> 02:10:30,989
You're threatening me.

3150
02:10:30,989 --> 02:10:32,767
I don't want to pacify you.

3151
02:10:32,793 --> 02:10:33,492
Get lost.

3152
02:10:33,492 --> 02:10:38,297
You think I'll go to Punjab with you after listening to all this?

3153
02:10:38,297 --> 02:10:39,218
Just wait and watch.

3154
02:10:39,244 --> 02:10:40,232
The minute we land..

3155
02:10:40,232 --> 02:10:42,034
...I'll immediately take a flight back.

3156
02:10:42,034 --> 02:10:43,802
Go away!

3157
02:10:43,802 --> 02:10:49,842
Give me your number.

3158
02:10:49,842 --> 02:10:55,113
Dear, I just dozed off.

3159
02:10:55,113 --> 02:11:02,487
What is it?

3160
02:11:02,487 --> 02:11:03,522
Stop it.

3161
02:11:03,522 --> 02:11:06,158
She laughed.

3162
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:07,693
Constable.

3163
02:11:07,693 --> 02:11:09,895
The Punjab Police is feeling sorry.

3164
02:11:09,895 --> 02:11:14,299
It's okay, constable.

3165
02:11:14,299 --> 02:11:18,303
The Punjab Police is feeling a little bit of love.

3166
02:11:18,303 --> 02:11:20,839
You know that.

3167
02:11:20,839 --> 02:11:22,241
...fling.

3168
02:11:22,241 --> 02:11:23,609
It's okay, constable.

3169
02:11:23,609 --> 02:11:25,817
It's okay?

3170
02:11:25,843 --> 02:11:33,986
Then you also tell me 'I love you'.

3171
02:11:33,986 --> 02:11:35,520
First tell me what 'flail' means.

3172
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:36,488
What? - Yes.

3173
02:11:36,488 --> 02:11:37,956
Why has 'flail' come between our love?

3174
02:11:37,956 --> 02:11:39,324
Will you tell me or should I go back?

3175
02:11:39,324 --> 02:11:41,360
This means you want to know it anyhow.
- Yes.

3176
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:43,695
Brother, stop.

3177
02:11:43,695 --> 02:11:44,429
Yes.

3178
02:11:44,429 --> 02:11:47,900
Today I'll tell you what it means.
- Please!

3179
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:51,236
Set hand.

3180
02:11:51,236 --> 02:11:52,988
Constable, actually.

3181
02:11:53,014 --> 02:11:56,228
even I don't know what 'flail' means.

3182
02:11:56,254 --> 02:11:57,476
- What?

3183
02:11:57,476 --> 02:12:01,980
Constable, I will..

3184
02:12:01,980 --> 02:12:03,815
I won't spare you!

3185
02:12:03,815 --> 02:12:09,554
I am going to kill you.

3186
02:12:09,554 --> 02:12:12,324
I missed you too, dear.

3187
02:12:12,324 --> 02:12:14,293
I missed you too, father.

3188
02:12:14,293 --> 02:12:19,498
I love you.

3189
02:12:19,498 --> 02:12:21,285
Please, father. Please, father.

3190
02:12:21,311 --> 02:12:22,668
At least listen to me.

3191
02:12:22,668 --> 02:12:24,970
Father, stop. Stop, father.

3192
02:12:24,970 --> 02:12:26,838
Father, calm down.

3193
02:12:26,838 --> 02:12:30,108
'After a little drama, the DC finally agreed.'

3194
02:12:30,108 --> 02:12:31,310
'How wouldn't he have agreed?'

3195
02:12:31,310 --> 02:12:34,546
'After all, his wife patched up with him on the condition..'

3196
02:12:34,546 --> 02:12:37,282
'..that both the constables will get married.'

3197
02:12:37,282 --> 02:12:38,383
Hands up.

3198
02:12:38,383 --> 02:12:43,889
'So, the Punjab police officer married the Vancouver police officer.'

3199
02:12:43,889 --> 02:12:47,426
He will cry..

3200
02:12:47,426 --> 02:12:52,331
'But like always, even this time, the wrong song was sung.'

3201
02:12:52,331 --> 02:12:56,131
There is a slight breeze.

3202
02:12:56,157 --> 02:12:59,171
Someone is crying.

3203
02:12:59,171 --> 02:13:02,674
Like me..

3204
02:13:02,674 --> 02:13:10,682
'But perhaps, this song was being played for them.'

3205
02:13:10,682 --> 02:13:13,518
You are handsome.

3206
02:13:13,518 --> 02:13:16,121
'They got settled.'

3207
02:13:16,121 --> 02:13:17,823
'But what happened to dacoit Shampy?'

3208
02:13:17,823 --> 02:13:19,958
How much longer will it take?

3209
02:13:19,958 --> 02:13:21,225
Shampy is tired!

3210
02:13:21,251 --> 02:13:23,996
Shampy will die! Shampy will die!

3211
02:13:23,996 --> 02:13:26,965
'And Shampy's favorite father?'

3212
02:13:26,965 --> 02:13:29,694
Buy Shampy's vehicle and father.

3213
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:30,802
It's sweet.

3214
02:13:30,802 --> 02:13:36,775
'He's been trying to collect money to
bring his dear son back to India.'

3215
02:13:36,775 --> 02:13:41,213
'Our Pakistani brother is letting go of the money.'

3216
02:13:41,213 --> 02:13:43,715
'The size of Inspector Joginder Singh's stomach..'

3217
02:13:43,715 --> 02:13:46,351
'..has reduced from 36 inches to 34 inches.'

3218
02:13:46,351 --> 02:13:49,821
'And Fateh Singh has gone from 34 to 36 inches.'

3219
02:13:49,821 --> 02:13:51,690
'It is said that even the Canada police..'

3220
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:55,727
'..are following Fateh Singh's techniques.'

3221
02:13:55,727 --> 02:14:03,135
'We completely forgot about granny.'

3222
02:14:03,135 --> 02:14:04,503
Where is everyone?

3223
02:14:04,503 --> 02:14:08,340
'So, this was the story of Jatt and Juliet.'

3224
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:10,105
'Hold on. Hold on.

3225
02:14:10,131 --> 02:14:11,576
Sorry. Sorry.'

3226
02:14:11,576 --> 02:14:12,811
'I forgot something.'

3227
02:14:12,811 --> 02:14:15,594
Stop! Stop! Hello!

3228
02:14:15,620 --> 02:14:17,449
Stop! Stop!

3229
02:14:17,449 --> 02:14:18,784
What's the matter, Inspector?

3230
02:14:18,784 --> 02:14:20,872
Why are you riding without a helmet?

3231
02:14:20,898 --> 02:14:22,554
Give me a fine of Rs. 1500.

3232
02:14:22,554 --> 02:14:23,295
Fine?

3233
02:14:23,321 --> 02:14:26,258
I think you didn't recognize me.

3234
02:14:26,258 --> 02:14:28,894
Whoever you are, pay the fine or I'll flail you.

3235
02:14:28,894 --> 02:14:30,857
Please don't flail me, inspector.

3236
02:14:30,883 --> 02:14:32,998
It'll spoil the beauty of my face.

3237
02:14:32,998 --> 02:14:35,033
Is that what 'flail' means?

3238
02:14:35,033 --> 02:14:36,145
Of course.

3239
02:14:36,171 --> 02:14:39,371
You can lam me if you want.

3240
02:14:39,371 --> 02:14:41,073
What does 'lam' mean?

3241
02:14:41,073 --> 02:14:42,611
He wants to know.

3242
02:14:42,637 --> 02:14:44,174
Why do you care?
