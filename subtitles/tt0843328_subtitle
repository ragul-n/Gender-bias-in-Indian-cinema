1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:04,370
Fiey warrior against
the narrow minded fanatics!

2
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:08,770
Warrior with the
power of mighty sea!

3
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:13,203
A warrior leader with
the purest heart!

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,204
A self existing warrior.

5
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:47,208
A warrior like the gentle cool
breeze across the Vindhyas!

6
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,704
A warrior with the
might of an army!

7
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,371
A warrior with the prowess of
Iegenday Bhima and Arjuna!

8
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,703
A warrior with
victoy all his way!

9
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:32,211
A warrior who renders justice leaving
behind a trail of destruction of evil!

10
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:39,235
12 years earlier...
Srilankan shore...

11
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,836
A village with refugees
from India.

12
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:46,302
Locals are attacking them
to chase them away.

13
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,804
People of the village living in
the constant fear of death.

14
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:55,068
Unable to bear the tortures
of Mughal Kings,

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,236
Jija Bai taught archey
to her son Shivaji,

16
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,800
and narrated him tales
of brave warriors.

17
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:04,070
She kindled patriotism in her son
and made him go against them.

18
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,835
Afzal Khan was the
Commander of Army then,

19
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:11,636
he was a seven feet tall demon!

20
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,168
Even he couldn't harm Shivaii.

21
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:18,569
So he arranged a fake peace
meeting and hugged him,

22
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,234
and stabbed him on the
back with a dagger.

23
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,368
Oh My god! Did Shivaii die?

24
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:25,402
No, he was wearing iron armour.

25
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:28,635
He split open Afzal Khan's chest
into two with iron nails.

26
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,270
People around there hailed
him as 'Chatrapathi'

27
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:34,800
What's the meaning
of it, mother?

28
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:39,268
One who lives for
himself is human,

29
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,235
one who lives for the
society is 'Chatrapathi'

30
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,968
What happened after that?

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,305
He built a grand fort for his mother,
made a golden swing,

32
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,001
looked after her vey well.

33
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,469
l'll also build a big bungalow
for you after l grow up.

34
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,534
l'll never allow sorrows and
difficulties to near you.

35
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,634
l'll look after you like a queen.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,868
You'll become a great man, my son.

37
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,067
Why should you build a
home for my mother?

38
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,500
Go and build it for your mother.

39
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:25,834
What are you saying Ashok?

40
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,168
Eveyone say that
when his mother died,

41
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:29,867
you were married to his
father as his second wife,

42
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:32,635
so l'm your only son,
he's his mother's son.

43
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:33,700
You're wrong son.

44
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,502
Even Lord Rama and Lakshmana
were step brothers.

45
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:41,468
They were role models
for brothers,

46
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:44,167
you both should emulate them.

47
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:47,568
l can't bear to see you both
fighting each other.

48
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:50,267
lt's a more grievous punishment
than death to me.

49
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,000
Mother...

50
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,137
Today is your birthday, right?
l brought a twin Mango as gift.

51
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:12,535
You know all my wishes.

52
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,835
The fruit is vey nice, son.
Where did you get it from?

53
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,068
He stole it from Sathanna's farm.

54
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,401
Did you steal it?

55
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:22,335
No mother.
- He's lying mother.

56
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:26,336
He bunked school to steal,
tell him to swear on you.

57
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:27,933
Swear on me.

58
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:33,900
How dare to steal!

59
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,302
l hoped you'll become
a great man.

60
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,035
Stealing! Will you do it again?

61
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:41,401
Will you? Tell me, get lost!

62
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:45,303
l hate to see your face.
Never show your face to me, go away.

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:56,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

64
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,901
Pullaiah asked 100
mangoes for pickles,

65
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,000
did you supply him?
- l supplied him sir.

66
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,534
Sathanna! - Yes.

67
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,302
My elder son stole this
mango from your farm.

68
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:08,533
Please forgive him.

69
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,502
No, he asked me
saying you like it.

70
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:14,102
l told him to take it,
but he refused to take it free

71
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,902
and worked till late evening
in the farm for it.

72
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,434
We told him take few more,

73
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:25,004
but he took only this twin mango saying
mother loves it like we brothers.

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,734
Son Shiva...

75
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:39,834
Son Shiva...

76
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,067
Mother.

77
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,134
Why did you hide the truth?

78
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,834
Why didn't you tell even after
l asked you to swear?

79
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:12,902
Whether l swear or not,
l'll tell only the truth.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,401
Come son, let's go to home.

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,436
l feel vey sleepy mother,
l'll sleep in your lap.

82
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:41,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

83
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:56,307
l mistook eveything black as water
and white as milk,

84
00:06:56,433 --> 00:07:00,036
that's why l'm repenting for it now.

85
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:06,305
Will my mistake get erased?

86
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:11,069
Even if it erases,

87
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,536
the sea laughed at me.

88
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:21,673
First time l experienced
the pain of motherhood.

89
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:16,372
Safe guarding your sorrows
and tears from the world,

90
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:22,772
l see a man deeper
than the mighty sea.

91
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:26,802
l was unfortunate not to
give birth to you,

92
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,807
but you still consider me
as your real mother.

93
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:43,239
This will never happen
again in future.

94
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:50,606
Trust me son,
l swear on your son.

95
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,534
Not only the mother and son,

96
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,434
no one else there slept that night.

97
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,303
Locals attacked them
to leave the place.

98
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,034
Village went up into flames.

100
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,333
Mother, let's go.

101
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,067
Did you see Shiva anmhere?

102
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,034
Mother.

103
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,535
Son.

104
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:38,599
Mother.

105
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,668
My mother and brother are missing.

106
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:43,735
They would've boarded
some boat, you get in.

107
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:47,500
Mother.

108
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:55,768
Son...Shiva...

109
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:58,034
Mother, brother...- Where?

110
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,968
There...he's inside the hut.

111
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,334
Mother...mother....

112
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,567
Son!

113
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,000
Mother.

114
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:24,303
You'll die if you get down...- My mother.
- They'll come in ne_ boat.

115
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,969
Come quickly...boats are leaving
...let's go fast.

116
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:14,767
My name is Bhadram.

117
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:16,200
l'm Shivaii.

118
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:24,036
Visakhapatnam Port.

119
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:30,769
Baji Rao, with these the
people for bonded labour,

120
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:34,436
sory the refugees you've
adopted are over 3000.

121
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,001
We too must...

122
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,533
Thank you sir.

123
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,135
Explain their position to them.
- Okay sir.

124
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,070
You've all entered
this county illegally,

125
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:47,301
legally you should be
thrown out from here,

126
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,102
but brother Baji Rao has
sympathy for you.

127
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,201
So, we'll overlook
your presence here.

128
00:11:52,466 --> 00:11:56,670
Sign the papers and
live with what he offers.

129
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,535
Go...go...go...

130
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,867
Taking our signatures
on white papers,

131
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:07,300
this is cheating.

132
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,134
We are also little educated.

133
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,201
lf not here we'll eke out
a living elsewhere.

134
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,567
We'll not sign the papers.

135
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,502
Don't harm me...
Don't harm me.

136
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:35,035
He'll die...my son...

137
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,968
You've seen, haven't you?

138
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:51,100
The rebel will not die.

139
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,767
His kin will die.

140
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:03,136
My legal business is loading
and unloading the ships here.

141
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,869
There's another illegal
business behind that.

142
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:10,936
That has made me the
Don of Visakhapatnam.

143
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:14,169
lt's vey difficult to off load
smuggled goods on shore,

144
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:16,534
l've to bribe evey
officer's greasy palm.

145
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:20,837
So, the goods must reach shore
when the ship is still in sea.

146
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,801
That's your iob.

147
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,536
lt's an illegal job,
so there'll be other groups,

148
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:29,835
there'll be attacks
for the goods.

149
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:35,670
Don't leave the goods behind
fearing police or the other gang.

150
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,634
lf you come back empty handed,

151
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:40,135
the life you saved there,

152
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,733
you'll lose it here.

153
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:08,334
12 years later...

154
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,702
By the way,
will he be alive or dead?

155
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,101
He would've died.

156
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,668
How can he survive so long?

157
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:23,400
He will be dead.

158
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,634
Then l stake...

159
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,834
My stake is Rs. 500, he's dead.

160
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,235
My stake is Rs. 800.
- Mine is Rs. 1000.

161
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:32,002
My stake is Rs. 1200.
- Mine is Rs. 1500.

162
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:38,269
He'll be definitely alive,
my stake is Rs. 2000.

163
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,568
Hey Pull him up!

_mARur_
Y l n F n

165
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:08,438
l know he'll not die.
He's a hero.

166
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,602
We know the goods
have been unloaded.

167
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,469
But you've vanished it
before our arrival.

168
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:25,002
How could you do it in mid-sea?

169
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,334
Shark!

170
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:37,300
Bet again.

171
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,534
lf we down him again,

172
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:43,203
will the shark eat first
his head or his body?

173
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,402
Body will soft, right?
It'll eat his body first.

174
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,106
Fool! If the shark is clever, it'll eat his
head first looking at his manliness.

175
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,334

lf you delay further,
eveyone will lose their legs.

179
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:29,270
Shark will go mad on
smelling human blood.

180
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:45,703
The rope must come easy
if the shark had eaten him,

181
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,701
but the rope isn't
coming up easily.

182
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:45,535
How long should l wait?

183
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,703

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,368

Our man freed us,

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,867
He's 'Chatrapathi' Shivaii!

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,934

for the killer shark.

194
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,036
Shark?! It'll bite into pieces.

195
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:43,367
How did you escape?

196
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:45,367
Actually...- Am l not here?

197
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,535
lt was not a male,
it was a female.

198
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:50,701
So what? Will it not harm him?

199
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,867
What can it do after
seeing our man?

200
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:56,203
lt would've blushed in shy,
sari would've slipped & it pulled up.

201
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,200
lt would've continued.

202
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,300
lt would've forgotten about eating.

203
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,869
Sari of a shark?
Did it slip down?

204
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:02,534
Can't you see?
Adjust your sari.

205
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:04,534
The sea is vey rough.

206
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:07,534
Bloody dirty face.

207
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,468
Come on girls,

208
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,035

You're not so poor to eat mud.

223
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,535
Some street play is

you're nothing to her.
-You're right.

Even kids don't respect us.

Can't you serve us Bandar sweet?
- l can't sunny.

278
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,468
He'll finish it himself.

279
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:55,536
Liar, l'll eat only sweets
and leave Bandar to him.

280
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:58,368
l've packed few things
for my mother.

00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:00,267
Few things are still here.

Why are you leaving so early?

285

l'll come to you at 3 pm and
then work for Katraj at night.

291
00:28:17,066 --> 00:28:18,700
As if he's some big Govt. Officer?

292
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,534
This is too much for your salay.

293
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,202
lf l get angy, l'll stop
working for you, be careful.

294
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:27,269
lf we were a rebel like him,
we would've prospered in life.

295
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:31,035
Mother...l'm coming...
why did you come out?

296
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:33,535
Didn't l tell you not
to venture out? You're blind.

297
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:35,201
You never listen to me
and stay in one place.

298
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,602
Where did l go?
Just at the threshold.

299
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,701
Do you know which is threshold
and which is street?

300
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,135
Vehicles and cows
walk on roads. You sit here.

301
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,370
Any news about your
mother and brother?

302
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,101
Your love for them
will keep them alive.

303
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,201
You'll definitely meet
them some day.

304
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:35,534
Brother has called from Bihar.

305
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,702
He has promised to get me ticket
in elections in place of Appala Naidu.

306
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,034
Then the entire Vizag
will be ours.

307
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:43,035
Let the illegal activities be out of
public glare for few months.

308
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:45,034
Don't let the troubles
and killings reach me.

309
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,300
Close these doors.

310
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,134
Onlookers must see only
the outside office.

311
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,467
Greeting sir.
- Greetings sir.

312

Tell them not to come here

People will know they
belong to our gang. - Okay.

Take your money and clear
the place immediately.- Okay sir.

How can you avoid it?

319
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,469
You'll die here if you come
back empty handed.

320
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,601
What are you looking there?
Massage here.

We need little more.

323

Why?

324
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,535
My younger sister...

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,534
What's that sound?

330
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:06,701
Your hands are talking and
your eyes have turned red.

331
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,867
Warning of death?

332
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,301

l don't see fear in his eyes
even after you warned him.

342
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,369
A man must be fearless like him.

343
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:53,368
You know about our life,
but still itching to fight them.

344

346
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:57,801
Clenching fists and biting teeth.

347
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,201
As if we don't have fists and teeth.

348
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,201
Why to get angy knowing
vey well about them?

349
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,703
lf we rebel it'll not end with us,
they'll kill all our people.

350
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:10,035
We should fend for ourselves.
Keep this.

351
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,034
Should we keep quite
despite his taunting?

352
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,701
We are living like eunuchs.

353
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,201
Shut up! Eunuchs or dogs,

354
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,869
to live we must endure
all their tyranny.

355
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:21,033
How long?

356
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:22,200
All our lives.

357
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,368
Why did we come here saving
our lives from Srilanka?

358
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:25,366
ls it to die here?

359
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:27,199
Come on.

360
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:29,700
Come.

361
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:51,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

362
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,533
What?

363
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,201
Who? Our Chinni?

364
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,367
No. Someone else.

365
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:08,534
Leave them.
Where will you search for them?

366
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:10,201
No, l must find them.

367
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,802
Taking leave at the drop of a hat,
roaming around with her boy friend.

368
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,468
Why are you bothered about that?

369
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:19,971
ldiot, catch her red handed,
blackmail her, get a treat eve_eek.

370
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:47,866
Look there!

371
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:07,700
Drop in at the right time, bloody!

372
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,867
What happened?

373
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:09,533
He...

374
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:13,236
What's this man? Finding a girl alone,
you'll go crazy.

375
00:34:13,466 --> 00:34:14,567
What? What do you
think of yourself?

376
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:17,368
What's that look?
Do we look like mad?

377
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,600
Why are you after him?

378
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,801
What a handsome man!
Look at his height!

379
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,134
Like a lighthouse.

380
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:36,034
Enough of ogling him, come.

381
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:40,368
l can't find your mother.

382
00:34:40,566 --> 00:34:42,868
What can l do if you trouble
me like this evey week?

383
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,536
Refugees from Srilanka have settled
from Kanyakumari to Kolkata.

384
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:47,934
l should to find them, shouldn't l?

385
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:49,868
You've already taken
Iot of money.

386
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:53,202
You're repeating the same dialogue.
But found nothing yet.

387
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,935
l'm no more on duty here.
Another girl has joined in my place.

388
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:58,635
Apply fresh again and
give it to her. Get lost.

389
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,868
Why are you laughing?

390
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:09,201
Has he swept you off your feet?

391
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,269
Nothing like that,
just a manly figure...

392
00:35:13,466 --> 00:35:14,800
l like him a little.

393
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:17,267
Anmay it's all over.

394
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,871
Don't know who he is...
where he'll be...will meet again or not...

395
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:25,701
Frowning face will not help,
smile a little.

396
00:35:30,733 --> 00:35:33,635
Looks like he's also bowled over,
he has come searching you.

397
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,033
What do you want?

398
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,633
This matter...

399
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:39,134
He has come with
a love letter to office.

400
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:41,867
What's this in office?

401
00:35:42,466 --> 00:35:44,534
This shouldn't be done in office.
Meet me later.

402
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,203
Buddy...sweet...sweet.
Bribe can get you her.

403
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,701
Don't do it free,
l don't mind the cost.

404
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:54,534
That's okay but...

405
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,935
What are you saying? Get out!

406
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:08,035
lf you're hesitating to tell
him the amount, tell me.

407
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,701
l'll settle it.

408
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,536
He's vey fast, he has come
along with a pimp.

409
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,035
What a lousy girl!
Angy at eveything.

410
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:24,701
Getting her do it is vey difficult.

411
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:39,134
Are you coming from Neelu?

412
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:40,800
May be it's that girl.

413
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,702
Why are you nodding your head?
l'll take your head in my bag.

414
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,134
Looks like you've given
her a letter too.

415
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,801
You'll lose your life.

416
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:55,036
No...no...control yourself.

417
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:04,040
Boy, you've to have my glamour
or style to fall in love.

418
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:07,700
Atleast have this!

419
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,602
How can you approach
her without any of these?

420
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,935
How could you dream of her
for your range?

421
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,035
With all that l've been
following her for 4 years,

422
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:18,468
just few times she talked
to me closely.

423
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,533
What did she say?

424
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:24,034
He's making me say that.

425
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:25,367
About eight months back,

426
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:26,533
while travelling in a bus,

427
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:32,467
she told me to move.

428
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:35,867
Recently six months ago,

429
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:37,867
when l was riding a bike,

430
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,968
she told me to drive carefully.

431
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,267
Don't tell anyone.

432
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,868
Recently she gave me
a chocolate also.- When?

433
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,968
August 15...is it necessay
to know now?- Great show!

434
00:37:52,233 --> 00:37:54,034
Nanda...Mahesh Nanda...

435
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,367
Handsome man of Waltair.

436
00:37:56,833 --> 00:38:00,369
You're no match to me
in anything...go...go...

437
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,371
Don't commit suicide for
the defeat in my hands.

438
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:10,068
My blessings are with you...go.

439
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,702
Long live Appala Naidu!

440
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,869
l entered politics to serve people.

441
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,034
l don't have any desire
for any position of power.

442
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,367
l was a Mayor,

443
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,367
l was a Zilla Parishad Chairman,

444
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:24,867
presently l'm a Minister.

445
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,369
l've experienced eveything.
What else do l need now?

446
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:34,538
Jaffar Khan of Delhi in charge
of our state is here.

447
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:42,207
lf he orders that l must contest the
elections and win it, l'll accept it.

448
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,503
Long live Appala Naidu!
- Stop!

449
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:50,171
lf he orders that new face like
Baji Rao will get a chance,

450
00:38:50,933 --> 00:38:53,502
l'll accept that too wholeheartedly.
l'll support him.

451
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:57,236
l'll abide by whatever the high
command of the party decides.

452
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,534
Nothing more to say...
- What are you saying sir?

453
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:00,534
How can anyone else other
than you get a ticket?

454
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:03,035
No Vizag without sea,
no party without you.

455
00:39:03,233 --> 00:39:07,203
Long live Appala Naidu!
- Stop! Stop!

456
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,703
Could we have won without
you in the last election?

457
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,202
Don't talk...how can he think
of any other candidate?

458
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,869
Who is this Baji Rao?
Did he serve the party like you?

459
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:17,367
Did he stood by party in crisis?

460
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,202
Moreover he's not a local.
He's from distant place Bihar.

461
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,534
lf he's given the ticket,

462
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:26,036
we must beat ourselves
with slippers.- Yes...yes...

463
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:27,200
What are you blabbering?

464
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:30,700
What's this, Baii Rao?

465
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:33,201
He said something emotionally.

466
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,702
Not him, l too say the same thing.
Will you beat me too?

467
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,134
So what if it's you.

468
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,033
What is this?

469
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:43,601
ls this a party meeting
or an animal market?

470
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,934
How dare to beat a Minister!

471
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:48,602
Party in-charge has seen
you beating me.

472
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,036
Tomorrow when he goes to Delhi,
how dare he beats Appala Naidu,

473
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:53,033
such a rogue,

474
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,967
such a loafer,

475
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:55,534
how can l recommend
him a seat,

476
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:57,034
if he says so,
will you beat him too?

477
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:57,700
Will you beat me?

478
00:39:58,066 --> 00:39:59,300
l don't care who so ever it may be.

479
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:00,934
Oh! He has beaten you too!

480
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:11,869
Hooliganism and Politics are
not one and the same.

481
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:14,700
What have you done man?

482
00:40:15,266 --> 00:40:19,136
Sir...he's a young man...
rush of blood.

483
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,869
he slapped you in anger,
don't take it to your heart.

484
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:24,802
Shut up! What are you saying?
Should l take his insult easily?

485
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,267
l'll show him my power.

486
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:29,268
Not only the party ticket, l'll not
allow him to hold the party flag too.

487
00:40:29,566 --> 00:40:31,367
Finished! Your life is finished.

488
00:40:31,566 --> 00:40:33,701
When l stamp my feet in Delhi,
you'll go aground in Vizag.

489
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:42,601
lt seems he'll finish me.

490
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,802
Brother, l'm Baii Rao speaking,

491
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,869
that rogue Jaffar Khan has
denied me the party ticket,

492
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:57,202
he's travelling to Delhi with
family in Samata express.

493
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,701
He shouldn't cross Bihar.

494
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,468
l've sent his photograph,
take a look.

495
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:11,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

496
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:23,868
No...no...

497
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,201
Jaffar Khan murdered.

498
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:44,366
Printing mistake.

499
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,201
He wasn't killed by the bandits,

500
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,134
but by my brother Ras Bihari.

501
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,804
Yes, he posed for photos to get
it published in newspapers.

502
00:41:53,566 --> 00:41:56,802
Pressmen wetted their pants
and changed the stoy.

503
00:41:57,066 --> 00:42:00,702
Minister, you were right.

504
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:07,202
Hooliganism and Politics are
not one and the same.

505
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:22,036
Think once again
about my application.

506
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:23,801
lf you want l'll pay in advance.

507
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,700
Excuse me...

508
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:36,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

509
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,534
Only once!

510
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:51,100
Go to Collector's office.

511
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,534
What's this? Who are you?

512
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:00,034
Get down! - Hey Go!

513
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:01,200
Sit here.

514
00:43:02,733 --> 00:43:04,701
l'll stab you. Go man.

515
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,204
Have l become so cheap
because l'm begging you?

516
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,569
For that will l accept if
you brandish a knife?

517
00:43:20,766 --> 00:43:21,733
l'll make you accept it.

518
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,101
No way l'm going to leave you
till l get what l want.

519
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,201
No girl will accept to do it.

520
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,871
l've never met anyone refusing
such an opportunity.

521
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,535
You're talking vey cheap.
- Don't act.

522
00:43:33,766 --> 00:43:37,202
You're playing a drama to
save your honour in public.

523
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,236
No one can hear you here.

524
00:43:40,433 --> 00:43:41,300
Finish the deal.

525
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,367
Quote your price?

526
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,534
l'm not that type of girl.

527
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,701
Then do it free.

528
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:51,900
Co-operate with me little.

529
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,701
lf you decide it'll be
over in five minutes.

530
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,101
Ty to understand my difficulty.

531
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:56,734
Will you do it tomorrow?

532
00:43:57,833 --> 00:43:58,767
Rape?

533
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,468
Why do you shout for eveything?

534
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:01,500
Othemise do it day after tomorrow.

535
00:44:04,766 --> 00:44:05,733
Day after tomorrow?

536
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:09,636
They made me run after pillar and
post in your office for 12 years.

537
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:10,900
No one works there.

538
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:13,735
You're a girl, l thought atleast
you'll understand my pain...

539
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:17,034
lt's fifteen days since l've applied.

540
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:18,500
You never cared to see it.

541
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:22,269
That's...is it an application
you've given me?

542
00:44:22,466 --> 00:44:24,267
Didn't you even see it?

543
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:30,068
When you told me to quote price...

544
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,234
...l didn't think you were
talking about bribe...

545
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:33,433
What did you think then?

546
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:36,369
l thought something else.

547
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,501
What's in your application?

548
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,834
l've been on your iob for a week.

549
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:42,800
Please take your seat.

550
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:46,903
There are many Rajyalakshmis in
the refugees list from Srilanka.

551
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:48,367
That has become a problem.

552
00:44:48,566 --> 00:44:51,669
l've details of all the people with same
name from all Collector's offices.

553
00:44:51,966 --> 00:44:54,802
See who is your mother in the list.

554
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,334
My mother!

555
00:45:20,633 --> 00:45:21,567
Check the address.

556
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:26,470
Her present address is not here,
but she's in India for sure.

557
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,234
Can l take this photo?

l found your protein symbol too...

572
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,903
Your number and my symbol
are a big scam...

573
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:16,337
Let my beauty and your enthusiasm
turn into a festival of love...

Who was that?

587
00:51:20,233 --> 00:51:21,767
Who dared to spill ink
on my sister?

588
00:51:21,966 --> 00:51:23,033
Heroes have come!

589
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:24,233

lt was just a casual mistake.

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,468
Casual...casual mistake...

593
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:15,967
l did that for fun.

594
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,800
What bloody fun!

595
00:52:29,066 --> 00:52:31,968
Get up...get up...

00:53:06,866 --> 00:53:09,335
l didn't find it in the bus.

602
00:53:18,266 --> 00:53:21,535
All my ill luck,
l found and lost my mother.

603
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:24,669
Calm down...you may've lost photo
but you'll find your mother.

604
00:53:24,866 --> 00:53:25,399
Calm down!

605
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:46,436
She's not your mother,
she's my mother...

606
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,071
She's my mother only.

607
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:06,734
Rituals are over madam.

608
00:54:12,633 --> 00:54:15,002
l've brought water from
Holy river Ganges,

609
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:16,234
if you keep this in your home,

610
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:18,168
it'll make your son
rest in peace.

611
00:54:24,033 --> 00:54:26,535
Why did you shave you head son?

612
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:29,902
Today is brother's
death anniversay, isn't it?

613
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:34,569
Elder brother is like a father.

614
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:38,635
That's why l tonsured my head.

615
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:45,902
l brought the Holy Ganges water
for your brother, be careful.

00:54:51,066 --> 00:54:55,537
Though l told her you're dead,

J

00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:10,269
l must kill the bond of love
between you both,

620
00:55:11,033 --> 00:55:15,470
and you, l must kill
both at a time.

621

Who is this girl?
- She works in the Collector's office.

626
00:55:49,233 --> 00:55:50,167
She's Shivaii's friend too.

627

Greetings sir.

628
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:54,269
My friend is vey serious,

Uncle, let them sit inside and
you close shop for sometime.

00:55:58,533 --> 00:56:00,868
Oh No! l didn't come here for that.

Who is Venkatalakshmi here?
- My mother.

00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,470
Her brother from Dubai
has petitioned for her.

634
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:16,667
Boy is vey lucky.

635
00:56:17,066 --> 00:56:19,134
He worked vey hard for his age.

636
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:20,901
His dark days are over.

637
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,536
Mother, she told that, greet her.
- Greetings madam.

638
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:29,902
l couldn't find my brother
who loves me so much.

639
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,268
And was forced to live
on my son's earnings.

640
00:56:32,766 --> 00:56:34,667
You've helped us a lot
by finding him.

641
00:56:34,866 --> 00:56:35,866
That's my duty.

642
00:56:36,066 --> 00:56:38,134
You're leaving tomorrow,
be ready.

643
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:41,802
Eveything is okay,
but Katraj must release him.

644
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,800
Yes uncle.

645
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,668
He must die here as bonded labour.

646
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:47,767
He'll not allow him to go.

647
00:56:49,466 --> 00:56:54,771
Our fate...no can change it.

648
00:56:56,766 --> 00:56:58,400
l'll make Katrai to accept.

649
00:56:59,866 --> 00:57:02,969
Really? Really brother!

650
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:06,101
Will you make him agree?
Promise me.

651
00:57:07,733 --> 00:57:10,335
Whether l swear or not,
l'll tell only the truth.

652
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:13,100
l'll make him to agree.

653
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:17,670
He massages my feet,
gently massages my body.

654
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:20,735
Who will do all that
he was doing for me?

655
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:23,134
Will you do it?

656
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:24,267

You're a great masseur.

662
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:50,101
You're massaging
up there vey well.

663
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,301

You've a great grip,

665
00:58:03,866 --> 00:58:07,502
if you were a woman,
l would've made you my concubine.

666
00:58:26,566 --> 00:58:29,135
He can go...you all go.

667
00:58:54,266 --> 00:58:56,201
What is this? - Love letter.

668
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,069
Me...? - Oh No...

669
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:00,200
To Neelaveni.

670
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:04,102
lt's not culture to write a love letter
to an unmarried woman.

671
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,935
You read it first, if you like it,
give it to Neelaveni.

672
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:09,534
lf you don't like it, tear it.

673
00:59:09,733 --> 00:59:11,101
l'll definitely give it to her.

674
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,167
What did she say?

675
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,401
She told you to keep it
safely in your pocket.

676
00:59:20,466 --> 00:59:22,968
Did she say like that?
My love was sincere.

677
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:25,268
Why did she refuse?
What do l lack?

678
00:59:25,466 --> 00:59:27,367
Tell me Sada,

679
00:59:27,566 --> 00:59:28,967
Bloody explanation!

680
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:43,301
How could you reiect me?

681
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,435
l'll bring flowers
and birds for you.

682
00:59:51,433 --> 00:59:52,300
Bloody shut up man!

683
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,401
Give me Rs. 50,
l'll set her up for you myself.

684
00:59:59,566 --> 01:00:00,533
Bribe...bribe...

685
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:01,900
Bribe for calling,
bribe for responding,

686
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,501
bribe to say name,
bribe to say native place,

687
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,834
bribe to love,
bribe to write love letter,

688
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:08,835
that's why India is number
one in love failures.

689
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:12,503
l'll not spare people like you.

690
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,837
Don't you fear me,
l'll kill you.

691
01:00:23,533 --> 01:00:26,535
Excuse me, you mustn't take
Iaw into your hands.

692
01:00:26,733 --> 01:00:30,169
What did she give in return

You are finished. - Why did you
tell me to be careful?

698
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:53,337
Both are dead,
who will save you now from me?

699
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:58,202
Turning back from me
will not save you.

700
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,937
Come...come...- Where?

701
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:14,203

Come here.

708
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:27,302
Will you beat me
because l'm going away?

You told me to go, didn't you?

01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:07,901
l'll not come,
l want to go home.

718
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,668
He's a great narrator.

719
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:32,936
Who gave you shelter when
you came here as refugees?

720
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:34,334
Baii Rao!

721
01:02:35,566 --> 01:02:40,938
You must live and
die for him only.

722
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,338
lf any of your kith and kin
come for you,

723
01:02:48,566 --> 01:02:50,935

you to go from here?

l'll rip out your skin!

725
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,004
Anyone wishing to go from
here will meet this end.

726
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,669
lf you want your children
to be alive,

727
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,369
stay here till the boy
breaths his last.

728
01:03:05,566 --> 01:03:09,002
lf anyone crosses this
line to save him...

729
01:03:35,233 --> 01:03:36,734
Come fast son.

730
01:03:37,699 --> 01:03:39,968
We are getting late
to the bus.

731
01:03:40,266 --> 01:03:42,134
Where did you go at this time?

732
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,769
Do you hear me?

01:03:48,133 --> 01:03:50,935
We are getting late,
where are you son?

734
01:03:55,833 --> 01:04:00,804

someone please call my son Suri.

735
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:07,138
Has my son Suri come
to you, Sathanna?

736
01:04:08,466 --> 01:04:11,302
What's this no one
is answering me?

737
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:41,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

738
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,868
He lied about freeing Suri.

739
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:03,834
He came early morning
to take him.

740
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,535
He promised to come back
after dropping his mother,

741
01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:09,267
but still the bastard
didn't spare him.

742
01:05:12,099 --> 01:05:14,902
He threatened to kill if anyone
dares to cross the line.

743
01:05:24,266 --> 01:05:29,004
No...don't...
please listen...no...

744
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,936
Leave him,
Iet it stop with him.

lf you cross, all of us will die,
come back.

01:05:40,533 --> 01:05:42,034
l'm talking to you!

747
01:05:42,233 --> 01:05:43,334
Stop it!

748
01:05:47,466 --> 01:05:48,733
Enough!

749
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:39,934
Take him to the hospital.

750
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:20,636
l brought holy Ganges water
for your brother, be careful.

751
01:09:41,466 --> 01:09:43,434
He got the vessel
at the right time.

752
01:09:43,633 --> 01:09:45,368
Don't know which gentleman
had kept it there.

753
01:10:54,733 --> 01:10:57,235
lt seems you've killed Katrai.

754
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:59,468
Though late,
you've done a good thing.

755
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:01,367
Anmay you've rebelled
against him.

756
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:04,135
Join me leaving Baii Rao.

757
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,967
We'll not do anything
illegal hereafter.

758
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:07,033
Leave us alone.

759
01:11:07,233 --> 01:11:11,136
Who will let you go away knowing
the money you can make.

760
01:11:11,366 --> 01:11:15,536
lf Katraj goes, it's Baji Rao,
after that some other man...

761
01:11:15,866 --> 01:11:18,802
l'm the best of all the lot.

762
01:11:19,366 --> 01:11:20,166
What do you say?

763
01:11:23,966 --> 01:11:24,833
What man?

764
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,637
Do you consider yourself a
great leader for killing a hooligan?

765
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:33,469
Low class people like you have
to live under someone,

766
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,334
you've got no other choice.

767
01:11:38,366 --> 01:11:44,605
Hello...has it started?
Don't let police go there.

768
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,670
Leader, it seems Baji Rao
has attacked your hamlet.

769
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:51,834
Go and show your prowess.

770
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:55,135
Will you kill my man for
killing a little boy?

771
01:11:55,366 --> 01:12:00,337
Not a boy must remain here,
get evey kid into the van.

772
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,202
They must reach Bihar
before tomorrow's dawn.

773
01:12:04,633 --> 01:12:06,634
How dare to rebel against us!

774
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:08,100
Please leave the kids.

775
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,669
They are innocent children,
what have they done to you?

776
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:11,800
Please leave them sir.

777
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,737
Sir, please spare our children.

778
01:12:20,933 --> 01:12:23,702
Anyone going against me will get
his child beheaded in Bihar.

779
01:12:23,899 --> 01:12:27,837
lf you want your children alive,
be my slaves.

780
01:12:28,033 --> 01:12:28,833
Leave me.

781
01:12:29,066 --> 01:12:31,201
Brother, they are taking away Ramu.

782
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:32,734
What do you want me to do?

783
01:12:32,933 --> 01:12:34,768
l told him not to rebel
against Baji Rao,

784
01:12:34,966 --> 01:12:36,133
nobody cared my words.

785
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:39,069
l'll not cy like you,
l'm surrendering myself to Baji Rao.

786
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,502
Don't spit on me,
spit on your lives.

787
01:12:42,699 --> 01:12:46,170
Leave this boy to me,
Iook, a boy is escaping there.

788
01:12:46,433 --> 01:12:50,036
Hey, come. How dare to rebel
against Baji Rao?

789
01:12:50,233 --> 01:12:52,168
Get eveyone,
don't spare anyone.

790
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,036
Go inside...go inside boy!

791
01:13:01,066 --> 01:13:05,036
l'm scared.
- No...don't get scared.

792
01:13:05,266 --> 01:13:07,301
Don't come out, stay put here.

793
01:13:12,433 --> 01:13:18,105
How dare to rebel against Baji Rao?
Bloody, l'll rip out your skin.

794
01:13:22,466 --> 01:13:25,368
There are two children in
that hut, pick them also.

795
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,836
This van is full
l'm putting them in th!at van.

796
01:13:34,033 --> 01:13:35,768
They'll not reform
unless we do like this.

797
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:46,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

798
01:13:50,033 --> 01:13:52,702
l don't know how they came here.

799
01:13:55,466 --> 01:13:57,501
Mother promise, l don't know.

800
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,234
Hey, you tell him.

801
01:14:04,433 --> 01:14:05,300
Brother Bhadram.

802
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:49,704
l couldn't save even one kid.

803
01:14:52,933 --> 01:14:54,768
We lived together
for 12 long years,

804
01:14:55,899 --> 01:14:59,003
death can't do us apart.

805
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:03,870
We are always together...

806
01:16:21,866 --> 01:16:22,566
Go boys!

807
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:30,267
What happened?

808
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:07,167
Beat me!

809
01:19:22,033 --> 01:19:25,136
You said we must be slaves
and there's no other way.

810
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:26,667
He's dead!

811
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:29,802
Dare to step into his shoes!

812
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,968
No! l don't want to
step into his shoes.

813
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,267
l'll follow you!

814
01:19:33,466 --> 01:19:36,335
You've my full support,
just order me.

815
01:19:37,566 --> 01:19:39,501
One step!

816
01:19:40,266 --> 01:19:41,133
One step?!

817
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,702
One step!

818
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:58,137
This is port area,
where my people live,

819
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:02,536
we struggled for years
to make two ends meet,

820
01:20:02,733 --> 01:20:04,968
we quenched our hunger
with our tears,

821
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:07,501
those tears have
become raging fire,

822
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:10,468
anyone nearing us will
be reduced to ashes.

823
01:20:10,666 --> 01:20:16,905
lf any tom, dick and hary,
tries to rule over us.

824
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:27,736
No one must step into my area.

825
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:37,870
Appala Naidu, whether you come
with rowdyism or attack us,

826
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,435
hooliganism or create factions,

827
01:20:40,733 --> 01:20:43,302
play politics or rowdyism.

828
01:20:43,566 --> 01:20:46,502
eveyone will be
sacrificed in the port.

829
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,837
Waves will turn into blood
and hit the shore.

830
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:14,902
Your lives are changed
for good from today,

831
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:19,037
slavey to rowdies and
politicians is over,

832
01:21:19,233 --> 01:21:24,805
buy the cowardice of
bearing humiliation and insults.

833
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,035
Hereafter your eyes must
Iook down only to see land,

834
01:21:27,233 --> 01:21:28,500
not to fall at anyone's feet.

835
01:21:28,699 --> 01:21:30,368
Hang your head down only
when you do a wrong,

836
01:21:30,566 --> 01:21:32,200
not in the fear of
some wrong doer.

837
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,002
Hereafter work is ours,
fruit is ours,

838
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,200
the power is also ours!

839
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:37,934
lf this rebellion asks
for a sacrifice,

840
01:21:38,133 --> 01:21:40,034
l'll be the first to give my head.

841
01:21:40,233 --> 01:21:42,635
l'll become your tear in pain,

842
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:45,001
l'll become your food in hunger,

843
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:50,972
l'll become your weapon
if anyone dares to fight you.

844
01:21:53,233 --> 01:21:55,602
Your mother didn't give birth
to you for selfish needs,

845
01:21:56,266 --> 01:21:57,767
but for the welfare of society.

846
01:21:58,833 --> 01:22:00,701
You're not iust Shivaii,

847
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:04,369
you're 'Chatrapathi' to shelter
the people around you.

848
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:05,867
Twist your whiskers.

849
01:22:52,266 --> 01:22:56,603
People hailed Shivaji
as 'Chatrapathi'

850
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,635
You'll become a great man.

851
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:26,568
Port area is in chaos
for the last 15 days,

852
01:23:26,766 --> 01:23:28,634
assault on Katraj,
Baji Rao's murder,

853
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:29,867
what's your comment on it?

854
01:23:30,166 --> 01:23:31,634
There's a new leader
'Chatrapathi' Shivaji in port area,

855
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:34,101
reports say he has your backing,
your comment on it.

856
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:35,500
What has happened is nothing,

857
01:23:35,699 --> 01:23:36,867
Ras Bihari from Bihar
will come down here,

858
01:23:37,066 --> 01:23:38,100
what will be your position then?

859
01:23:39,566 --> 01:23:42,302
He says let that bastard come,
Iet me see what he can do,

860
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,367
Stop them here.

861
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,769
Patient's condition is serious and
you're creating nuisance here.

862
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:53,801
All are gone,
you can get up sir.

863
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,868
Oh my god!

864
01:23:58,066 --> 01:24:01,202
l thought Baji Rao's death will
bring some peace to me.

865
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:03,969
Now it has become
a thorn in my flesh.

866
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:05,667
What's this man?

867
01:24:06,066 --> 01:24:07,901
step fomard it's
danger of 'Chatrapathi',

868
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,768
behind there's the lurking
danger of Ras Bihari.

869
01:24:09,966 --> 01:24:12,368
Any which way is danger to me.

870
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,870
lt's not Bihari
it's Vihari, Dr. Vih' ari!

871
01:24:20,466 --> 01:24:22,401
Bloody hell!

872
01:24:22,666 --> 01:24:25,235
First change your name.

873
01:24:25,433 --> 01:24:30,204
His name is giving
me jitters, go out.

874
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:34,303
My condition is vey
serious for a month,

875
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,469
whether it's my wife, children,
CM or PM calling on phone,

876
01:24:37,666 --> 01:24:39,367
don't give it to me.

877
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:43,934
l mean l'm in coma.

878
01:24:46,433 --> 01:24:48,101
Hello...who is that?

879
01:24:48,533 --> 01:24:50,434
Mr. Chatrapathi?!
- Mr. Chatrapathi?!

880
01:24:51,233 --> 01:24:51,967
Greetings sir.

881
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:54,501
What sir? Minister?

882
01:24:58,199 --> 01:25:00,302
l think he'll not survive this...

883
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,369
he's on the verge of death...

884
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:05,733
What sir?

885
01:25:07,633 --> 01:25:08,567
ls it sir?

886
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:10,567
Okay sir.

887
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,434
Bye sir.

888
01:25:13,899 --> 01:25:16,836
Your time is good.- What?
He's coming personally.

889
01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:21,034
Who am l? - Minister.

890
01:25:21,233 --> 01:25:22,834
Can anyone meet me
without an appointment?

891
01:25:23,033 --> 01:25:24,000
That's why l'm going.

892
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,001
Minister's condition
is vey serious.

893
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:33,940
...he's suffering from
multiple health set backs.

894
01:25:35,899 --> 01:25:38,702
We can't say anything
till another 48 hours.

895
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,001
You've recorded the doctor's
statement, haven't you?

896
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,368
Minister is fighting death here.

897
01:25:43,566 --> 01:25:45,134
l'll report any new progress here.

898
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:47,268
With cameraman Senthil,
this is reporter Rekha.

899
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:57,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

900
01:25:58,866 --> 01:26:03,670
Hereafter all the business and
contracts must be legally valid.

901
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:06,502
Using child labour for smuggling,
illegal businesses,

902
01:26:06,699 --> 01:26:07,934
eveything must close down.

903
01:26:08,133 --> 01:26:12,370
Oh my god! Billions!
Billions of worth!

904
01:26:12,566 --> 01:26:13,333
He may burn it.

905
01:26:13,533 --> 01:26:14,667
You're lucky.

906
01:26:15,066 --> 01:26:17,134
He doesn't know you
do illegal business.

907
01:26:17,433 --> 01:26:19,902
What do we get if we
do business honestly?

908
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,969
You paid doles to Baji Rao
and politicians till now,

909
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:26,469
to recover that you
underpaid your workers,

910
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:29,101
you needn't pay bribes
to anyone hereafter,

911
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,102
you take your profit and
pay well your workers,

912
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,334
eveyone will be happy,

913
01:26:33,533 --> 01:26:36,302
the money amassed by Baji Rao
from your pockets,

914
01:26:36,633 --> 01:26:38,935
l'll use it for the welfare
of downtrodden.

915
01:26:46,466 --> 01:26:49,769
Looks like Minister is not willing
to appreciate wholeheartedly.

916
01:26:50,466 --> 01:26:52,734
Oh No! l'm a politician.

917
01:26:52,933 --> 01:26:55,068
l don't accept things easily.

918
01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:59,536
What do we get after
entering public life?

919
01:26:59,733 --> 01:27:02,235
A dhothi beneath,
a napkin on the shoulders,

920
01:27:02,433 --> 01:27:06,069
a walking stick, a cement statute
in the mid-town area.

921
01:27:06,266 --> 01:27:09,335
That's all...that's all...

922
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:35,371
You got to this position killing
a man and injuring one.

923
01:27:36,133 --> 01:27:37,534
You can't retain it.

924
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,367
lmpossible.

925
01:27:40,899 --> 01:27:44,837
You can't become a leader aspiring
welfare of the labour class.

926
01:27:45,266 --> 01:27:46,667
To become one,

927
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,901
you don't need a suit,

928
01:27:49,266 --> 01:27:53,203
you've to be tyrannical,
cheat and fraud.

929
01:27:53,399 --> 01:27:55,401
You don't have any of
these qualifications.

930
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,770
lt's iust a snap of fingers time,

931
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:03,936
to get back all that you've
seized from my brother.

932
01:28:04,699 --> 01:28:07,969
Look at me, Ras Bihari.

933
01:28:09,433 --> 01:28:11,001
Tiger of Bihar.

934
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:58,102
You know only half of rowdyism,
just to kill people,

935
01:28:58,399 --> 01:28:59,934
you don't know to die,

936
01:29:00,166 --> 01:29:03,102
for that you need courage here.

937
01:29:04,733 --> 01:29:07,035
You died the moment you
took a step back in fear.

938
01:29:07,566 --> 01:29:09,601
What the hell can you do now?

939
01:29:10,433 --> 01:29:11,801
Go to hell boy!

940
01:29:37,399 --> 01:29:39,034
We have to send goodies
to my daughter in America,

941
01:29:39,233 --> 01:29:40,367
we have only three days,

942
01:29:40,566 --> 01:29:42,968
we want two varieties
of pickles and sweets.- Okay sir.

943
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:44,501
Take Rs. 5000 as advance.

944
01:29:44,699 --> 01:29:47,836
l'll come day after tomorrow for
delivey & pay the balance.- Okay sir.

945
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:58,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

946
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:09,404
What happened to taking the
contract of parking in bus stand?

947
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:10,834
l'm tying mother.

948
01:30:12,266 --> 01:30:13,600
l'll get Rs. 10000
day after tomorrow.

949
01:30:13,899 --> 01:30:15,067
lf you need pay for it.

950
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:18,001
l'm not able to work any more.

951
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:20,802
Your earnings will bring
little comfort to me.- Yes mother,

952
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:25,936
l've come to know that l've got
much work to do here.

953
01:30:26,733 --> 01:30:27,467
l'll do.

954
01:30:28,633 --> 01:30:31,302
l'll do to change
our lives dramatically.

955
01:30:33,266 --> 01:30:34,967
Hey stop!

956
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:39,169
All are playing holi here,
what are you guys doing there?

957
01:30:39,366 --> 01:30:40,467
Come down boys.

958
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:43,400
Will you come down or
shall l come up there?

959
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,468
That's it, go & get him here.

960
01:30:47,666 --> 01:30:48,299
You...?

961
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,602
Please listen to me once!
- Brother!

962
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:52,668
Leave me...leave me.

963
01:30:52,866 --> 01:30:53,666
Unnecessarily...

964
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,334
Don't beat me...kill me.

965
01:31:04,633 --> 01:31:07,168
l shouldn't live, kill me.

966
01:31:07,366 --> 01:31:09,434
l didn't come to tease her,

967
01:31:09,733 --> 01:31:13,903
l came to seek her pardon
before my death.

968
01:31:17,066 --> 01:31:21,336
My mother died in the
shock of my behaviour.

969
01:31:22,533 --> 01:31:26,236
Anyone will tonsure his head
after mother's death,

970
01:31:26,433 --> 01:31:31,938
but l tonsured my head and
then killed my mother.

971
01:31:34,699 --> 01:31:36,301
l was a wastrel,

972
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:40,670
my mother dreamt about good
and respectable life for me.

973
01:31:40,866 --> 01:31:43,101
l couldn't fulfill her wish.

974
01:31:43,399 --> 01:31:46,803
This shaven head killed her.

975
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,872
l don't want to live any more.

976
01:31:53,066 --> 01:31:54,200
Kill me...kill me.

977
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:56,702
Forgive me, l never
expected this turn.

978
01:31:56,899 --> 01:31:58,601
Why are you seeking forgiveness?

979
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,536
l deserve this punishment,
death is the only way to me.

980
01:32:01,733 --> 01:32:02,433
No.

981
01:32:02,866 --> 01:32:05,401
Your mother's dream
must come true.

982
01:32:05,866 --> 01:32:08,702
Ajay, take him into our service.
- Okay.

983
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:15,535
l'm working with 'Chatrapathi',

984
01:32:16,166 --> 01:32:17,700
if you plan his death,

985
01:32:17,933 --> 01:32:21,703
l'll hit him on the soft corner,
and get him to you alone.

986
01:32:22,433 --> 01:32:24,701
Do you want to kill him or not?

987
01:32:24,899 --> 01:32:26,234
Why not, if we get a
chance to kill him.

988
01:32:26,433 --> 01:32:28,234
We'll tear him into pieces,
get him here.

989
01:32:28,433 --> 01:32:30,735
Hey Skin head! Your head will roll
if anything goes wrong.

990
01:32:30,933 --> 01:32:34,936
l'm clear from my side,
take care of your side.

991
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,134
What's your connection with him?

992
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:42,269
lt's the connection
of a knife and hair.

993
01:33:07,033 --> 01:33:09,201
Why? Why do you hurt me here?

994
01:33:19,566 --> 01:33:22,769
No..you mustn't cy...
you must be happy always.

995
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,634
What to do?

996
01:33:27,566 --> 01:33:31,102
l've only one wish
since my childhood.

997
01:33:31,733 --> 01:33:32,867
Tell me dear.

998
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:34,534
My future husband,

999
01:33:35,233 --> 01:33:36,534
...must be a sadist.

1000
01:33:37,233 --> 01:33:40,202
Can't you be one?
Okay, l'll find another man

1001
01:33:40,899 --> 01:33:43,302
You're under estimating
my abilities.

1002
01:33:46,899 --> 01:33:48,201
Cutting with blades...

1003
01:33:48,399 --> 01:33:49,534
That's great expression.

1004
01:33:49,733 --> 01:33:51,201
piercing with pins...

1005
01:33:52,133 --> 01:33:54,034
burning with cigarettes..

1006
01:33:54,566 --> 01:33:57,535
beating wife black and blue...

1007
01:33:58,233 --> 01:34:00,702
lt's all my inborn talents, you know?

1008
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,535
First prove it in public,
then l'll mary you.

1009
01:34:08,566 --> 01:34:09,967
We'll get the contract in two days...

1010
01:34:14,066 --> 01:34:15,033
What happens to you...

1011
01:34:24,066 --> 01:34:25,033
Did you see him?

1012
01:34:28,066 --> 01:34:29,267
You're making a wrong move.

1013
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,869
No need of bloodshed.
Send her.

1014
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:33,867
What will you do then?

1015
01:34:35,466 --> 01:34:37,534
l've to rape her urgently.
Send her.- Why?

1016
01:34:38,133 --> 01:34:40,201
Eveyone must praise me
as a great sadist.

1017
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:43,870
World must talk about my sadism.
Come on talk.

1018
01:34:44,066 --> 01:34:45,300
Talk to him boys.

1019
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,700
What happened?

1020
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:55,536
l don't have anyone in this world.
Let it be there.

1021
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:56,700
l'll stay with you.

1022
01:34:58,733 --> 01:34:59,533
Take him away.

1023
01:35:00,566 --> 01:35:02,200
You can't do any harm to me.

1024
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:05,536
l'll make you sweat out,
l'm Nanda of Waltair.

1025
01:35:17,233 --> 01:35:18,901
Call me after regaining
consciousness...

1026
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,668
...l meant you.
- What are you saying man?

_mARur_
Y l n F n

1028
01:35:45,066 --> 01:35:51,872
Pierced...the pin has pierced...

1029
01:35:52,066 --> 01:35:54,868
My heart fell for it...

1030
01:35:55,066 --> 01:35:58,536
Scooped out the secrets...

1031
01:35:58,733 --> 01:36:05,539
lf the pin pierces you,
it's my mistake...

1032
01:36:05,733 --> 01:36:08,535
Shall l relieve your pain?

1033
01:36:08,733 --> 01:36:12,203
Shall l bring comfort to
you by blowing over it?

1034
01:36:41,566 --> 01:36:44,869
First time it was fun...

1035
01:36:45,066 --> 01:36:48,202
Second time it's more fun...

1036
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:51,703
Once in day time...

1037
01:36:51,899 --> 01:36:55,036
Many a times at bed time...

1038
01:36:55,233 --> 01:37:01,372
Take me to pacify my anger
and bad mood.

1039
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:07,538
Shall l become a
slave in your bed?

1040
01:37:12,733 --> 01:37:14,534
You make me yearn for more...

1041
01:37:15,066 --> 01:37:22,039
Leave your shyness and
come after me...

1042
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:29,040
Show your power and
tell me your sweet tales.

Akash! Where is Shivaji?

1059
01:41:32,033 --> 01:41:33,567
Did he call on phone?
- No.

1060
01:41:33,966 --> 01:41:35,434
Where has he gone?

1061
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:59,640
Hey Buddy Munnabhai!
Tell me that 'Chatrapathi' is dead.

1062
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,134
Why don't you talk to me?

1063
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,467
What happened?

1064
01:42:11,666 --> 01:42:13,367
Take her to hospital.
- How did you get hurt?

1065
01:42:13,566 --> 01:42:14,533
Where is Akash?
- Upstairs.

1066
01:42:14,733 --> 01:42:15,700
Where did you go?
- Gun.

1067
01:42:18,733 --> 01:42:19,366
Come, let's go.

1068
01:42:32,066 --> 01:42:34,034
Come...come...my dear...

1069
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:36,535
l've to tell you a short stoy.

1070
01:42:39,066 --> 01:42:40,367
Long time ago in Srilanka,

1071
01:42:40,566 --> 01:42:44,369
a home in that island,
a mother in that home.

1072
01:42:46,899 --> 01:42:49,869
Ashok is her real son.

1073
01:42:50,733 --> 01:42:53,202
Shivaii was a foster son.

1074
01:42:53,733 --> 01:42:54,200
Brother!

1075
01:42:54,399 --> 01:42:57,636
Luck favoured and Shivaji
has become 'Chatrapathi'

1076
01:42:57,899 --> 01:43:01,036
Ashok has become Akash
and joined him.

1077
01:43:05,066 --> 01:43:07,034
Brother!
- Who is your brother?

1078
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:13,371
Our father is same.
Our mothers are different.

1079
01:43:16,166 --> 01:43:19,369
l hate you since my childhood.

1080
01:43:20,300 --> 01:43:22,535
l'm so iealous to kill you also.

1081
01:43:23,466 --> 01:43:29,038
l lied to my mother
that you are dead.

1082
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:35,938
l joined hands with Ras Bihari
to make it come true.

1083
01:43:36,133 --> 01:43:37,534
You cheated death.

1084
01:43:39,466 --> 01:43:43,203
lf you're angy on me,
do anything to me.

1085
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:44,867
Where is mother?

1086
01:43:45,333 --> 01:43:46,701
l wish to see her once.

1087
01:43:47,233 --> 01:43:50,536
You want mother...
You want mother...

1088
01:43:51,066 --> 01:43:53,535
You'll never leave us alone...

1089
01:43:55,066 --> 01:43:55,866
No use...

1090
01:43:56,466 --> 01:43:57,200
lf l kill you...

1091
01:43:57,733 --> 01:44:01,203
Your people will find
and kill me, right?

1092
01:44:01,566 --> 01:44:03,200
No, it'll not happen.

1093
01:44:06,333 --> 01:44:08,034
Mother, it's me Ashok.

1094
01:44:08,233 --> 01:44:10,535
l'm working for 'Chatrapathi',
am l not?

1095
01:44:10,733 --> 01:44:12,601
l saw him killing a girl.

1096
01:44:13,633 --> 01:44:15,534
l'm scared that
he might kill me.

1097
01:44:17,066 --> 01:44:21,036
Chatrapathi, don't kill me,
l'll follow all your diMats.

1098
01:44:21,233 --> 01:44:23,702
Please don't kill me...
Ieave me...

1099
01:44:23,899 --> 01:44:28,371
Mother!

1100
01:44:35,566 --> 01:44:36,033
Brother!

1101
01:44:37,733 --> 01:44:41,636
l'm not mad to kill myself.

1102
01:44:44,333 --> 01:44:48,370
Now you're a killer
to my mother,

1103
01:44:48,566 --> 01:44:50,868
you tried to kill me.

1104
01:44:52,733 --> 01:44:53,633
Fate!

1105
01:44:55,066 --> 01:45:02,306
Mother will believe you
if l say all this is an enactment.

1106
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:08,539
Mother trusts you more
than me, her own son.

1107
01:45:09,899 --> 01:45:16,539
But, can you tell her
l'm a vile and a cheat.

1108
01:45:17,233 --> 01:45:19,969
can she bear that truth?

1109
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:29,473
After losing a son, she's living
like dead for the past 12 yrs.

1110
01:45:30,066 --> 01:45:35,704
if she comes to know
l'm a cheat, she'll die.

1111
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:42,036
Scared? What will you do now?

1112
01:45:42,233 --> 01:45:45,102
Will you tell her the truth
and lose her?

1113
01:45:45,399 --> 01:45:49,470
Will you stay away
and let her live?

1114
01:45:49,666 --> 01:45:53,369
What will you do now, bloody?

1115
01:45:53,733 --> 01:45:55,034
Brother...

1116
01:46:03,066 --> 01:46:05,368
l inquired with the doctor,
he says he's out of danger.

1117
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:09,434
Mother will come here now.

1118
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,701
She'll think you'd shot Ashok.

1119
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:14,868
She'll hate our presence here,
come let's go.

1120
01:46:15,066 --> 01:46:15,800
You go.

1121
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,867
No buddy...

1122
01:47:16,233 --> 01:47:18,034
He's Chatrapathi.

1123
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:28,702
Are you the Chatrapathi
whom people hail?

1124
01:47:30,733 --> 01:47:32,201
Do you know the meaning of it?

1125
01:47:33,399 --> 01:47:36,369
Man living for the welfare of people
around him is called Chatrapathi.

1126
01:47:37,066 --> 01:47:41,637
Not a man who kills for
pointing your mistake.

1127
01:47:43,066 --> 01:47:44,300
Do you've a mother?

1128
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:50,103
Didn't you think about
that man's mother?

1129
01:47:50,666 --> 01:47:53,869
have you forgotten about a
mother's pain in killing others?

1130
01:47:55,566 --> 01:48:00,037
People, police may not dare to touch you,
but there's god up above,

1131
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,868
your sins will destroy you.

1132
01:48:03,666 --> 01:48:08,437
A mother's curse will ruin you.

1133
01:48:25,466 --> 01:48:31,538
Don't hide a mother's mistakes.
Don't hide your wounds.

1134
01:48:31,733 --> 01:48:38,206
Don't burden me
with your sacrifices.

1135
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:45,539
Tell me if l'm wrong
to reform myself.

1136
01:48:52,333 --> 01:48:58,872
Never again l'll commit
any mistake.

1137
01:48:59,066 --> 01:49:06,039
Trust me son,
l swear on you.

1138
01:49:24,733 --> 01:49:27,035
You never informed anyone
where you're going.

1139
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,868
Didn't l tell you to get it ready
to send by today's flight?

1140
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:43,900
You haven't done anything yet.

1141
01:49:44,366 --> 01:49:46,134
lf we don't get things at
right time, what's the use?

1142
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,567
What will we do with it?

1143
01:49:47,766 --> 01:49:51,069
No sir, my son is not well...

1144
01:49:51,266 --> 01:49:52,233
No lies please,

1145
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:55,569
l'll send my man by evening,
order must be ready or else...

1146
01:49:55,833 --> 01:49:58,468
Come, pay advance and
run after these people.

1147
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:09,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

1148
01:50:30,899 --> 01:50:31,700
How is mother?

1149
01:50:31,966 --> 01:50:32,800
She's fine.

1150
01:50:33,966 --> 01:50:35,701
lf all of us give
a helping hand...

1151
01:50:36,399 --> 01:50:38,769
Luckily l've got a chance
to help my mother.

1152
01:50:39,233 --> 01:50:41,368
l must enjoy those
moments alone.

1153
01:50:41,566 --> 01:50:42,533
Will you do it all alone?

1154
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,301
Who are you?

1155
01:51:56,333 --> 01:51:58,301
All these...- l prepared them.

1156
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:00,802
l came here selling papads,

1157
01:52:01,399 --> 01:52:02,801
and found eveything
Iying around as it is,

1158
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,801
l finished it fearing
they may get spoilt.

1159
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,802
How am l to thank you?
- No need of that.

1160
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,303
Mother's life must change for good.
She mustn't face any more difficulties.

1161
01:52:11,633 --> 01:52:13,568
You can give money
to Ashok, right?

1162
01:52:13,766 --> 01:52:15,801
He'll not take a penny from me.

1163
01:52:16,399 --> 01:52:17,300
What shall we do now?

1164
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:20,302
What? What's this?
No details, no formalities,

1165
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,802
will he permit you to start
a hostel just if you apply?

1166
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,269
Commissioner will not
sign your application.

1167
01:52:26,666 --> 01:52:28,300
Mussouria?

1168
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,969
Calling me names?- No sir.

1169
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:36,137
How to make him agree?
- What's that?

1170
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:36,967
Bribe.

1171
01:52:37,166 --> 01:52:40,135
He'll strangle your neck.
- What's that?

1172
01:52:41,166 --> 01:52:42,367
He'll bite your neck.

1173
01:52:44,399 --> 01:52:45,200
What's that?

1174
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:49,468
He's a hooligan himself,
hooliganism with him?

1175
01:52:49,833 --> 01:52:52,135
l don't care even if you are
Minister's brother-in-law.

1176
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:55,235
You're threatening me
like a small kid.

1177
01:52:55,833 --> 01:52:58,135
l've faced many threats
like these in my service.

1178
01:52:58,333 --> 01:53:00,802
You do what you can
and l'll do what l can.

1179
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,601
hang up now...shut up!

1180
01:53:03,399 --> 01:53:07,137
Why are you sitting as if this
is your father's office?

1181
01:53:07,333 --> 01:53:07,966
What do you want?

1182
01:53:08,166 --> 01:53:10,301
Rs. 5 billions bridge contract
has been awarded to this city.

1183
01:53:10,666 --> 01:53:12,134
Ashok must get that contract.

1184
01:53:12,666 --> 01:53:15,301
Chatrapathi will manage
other contractors.

1185
01:53:15,666 --> 01:53:18,468
lf there's any pressure on you
from top, he'll manage it.

1186
01:53:18,666 --> 01:53:20,701
He'll stand guarantee for
the bridge's quality & surety.

1187
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,036
So, sign the contract
in favour of Ashok.

1188
01:53:24,233 --> 01:53:26,335
Let him sign it,
why do you need me?

1189
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:29,669
You don't seem to care about officers.
Gave a good lecture, go now.

1190
01:53:29,833 --> 01:53:31,067
You don't know about Chatrapathi.

1191
01:53:31,266 --> 01:53:32,967
You too don't know about me.

1192
01:53:38,266 --> 01:53:41,702
Sir, you're new to this area,
you don't know about him.

1193
01:53:41,899 --> 01:53:45,136
He killed famed rowdies Katraj and
Baji Rao to become Chatrapathi.

1194
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:55,001
l beg you sir, forget honesty,
first sign the papers.

1195
01:53:55,266 --> 01:53:55,899
Sign here.

1196
01:53:57,266 --> 01:53:59,968
They have reduced
Govt. to nothing.

1197
01:54:00,166 --> 01:54:03,302
Eveyone comes and threatens.

1198
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,368
Where else?- Here...

1199
01:54:05,833 --> 01:54:07,801
How many more? Will you write off
my property also to him?

1200
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,800
Just one more, sir.

1201
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:11,300
Take it sir.

1202
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:17,800
Eveything is okay.

1203
01:54:43,266 --> 01:54:44,700
Only three bombs are here,
where's the fourth?

1204
01:54:45,933 --> 01:54:46,566
That...

1205
01:54:48,666 --> 01:54:49,700
Please get up sir.

1206
01:55:28,933 --> 01:55:31,969
My father told always
about danger of seat.

1207
01:55:32,166 --> 01:55:35,369
But he never told about
the danger under the seat.

1208
01:55:35,666 --> 01:55:39,970
l'll never sit again, by now my
funeral would've been going on.

1209
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:52,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

l'm after you...l'm after you...

1212
01:56:11,666 --> 01:56:15,136
There are no secrets between us...

1213
01:56:17,899 --> 01:56:24,473
There are no secrets but
there's a common known thing...

1214
01:56:37,399 --> 01:56:40,402
A twist in the climax...

1215
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:42,468
Will you come my dear?

1216
01:57:33,766 --> 01:57:41,373
Don't inspire challenges
with your words...

1217
01:57:44,533 --> 01:57:47,369
You're a phobia
without medication...

1218
01:57:47,633 --> 01:57:51,103
lf it goes beyond control,
shall l bring it down at midnight?

1219
01:57:53,833 --> 01:58:00,139
For your midnight mania,
there's a beautiful idea...

1220
01:58:13,266 --> 01:58:16,469
Ready...steady...get robbed...

1221
01:59:01,266 --> 01:59:04,302
No regrets in losing
my virginity...

1222
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:07,236
l've managed to control a man
with my apron strings...

1223
01:59:10,833 --> 01:59:13,802
Old philosophy has
Iost it's charm...

1224
01:59:14,166 --> 01:59:17,135
l've attained liberation
in few minutes...

1225
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:23,469
World is an illusion,
desire is bottomless...

1226
01:59:23,666 --> 01:59:26,802
l fell into it...

1227
01:59:39,666 --> 01:59:42,802
l got the world in a iiffy...

1228
02:00:19,766 --> 02:00:21,734
Come man, why are you hesitating
when a Minister is calling you?

1229
02:00:22,266 --> 02:00:23,000
Go.

1230
02:00:27,433 --> 02:00:28,066
Greetings sir.

1231
02:00:28,266 --> 02:00:29,066
Greetings...come.

1232
02:00:29,266 --> 02:00:32,068
l'm a poor man fighting
eveyday for mere survival.

1233
02:00:32,266 --> 02:00:36,069
l can't believe a Minister coming
to me and offering the contract.

1234
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:38,968
What made you
to be so generous?

1235
02:00:39,166 --> 02:00:42,536
The courage to go
against Chatrapathi.

1236
02:00:44,166 --> 02:00:47,536
l'll invest but
you'll run the show.

1237
02:00:49,933 --> 02:00:52,435
Only we know the
deal between us,

1238
02:00:52,633 --> 02:00:55,569
if you cross swords
with Chatrapathi,

1239
02:00:55,766 --> 02:00:58,401
l'll drop you just
like a hot potato.

1240
02:00:58,600 --> 02:00:59,867
Entire risk is yours, be careful.

1241
02:01:00,066 --> 02:01:03,202
He'll not come
anmhere near me,

order to the tee.

02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:25,735
What's between you two...

1246
02:01:26,433 --> 02:01:29,269
when my man asked
l chided him.

1247
02:01:29,466 --> 02:01:30,333
Bye.

1248
02:01:32,399 --> 02:01:35,736
l'll build a big bungalow
for you after l grow up.

1249
02:01:41,433 --> 02:01:42,066
Look Nanda.

1250

Okay as you please.

Neelu is going to mary Chatrapathi.

1252
02:01:48,266 --> 02:01:51,669
You too must mary and settle,
so that you don't disturb them.

02:01:52,199 --> 02:01:54,068
ls it fixed?

1254
02:01:54,766 --> 02:01:58,803
Unable to bear his tortures,
Neelu will come to me.

1255
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,937
l must be so high that
she can't reach me.

1256
02:02:05,066 --> 02:02:06,434
l know a teacher.

1257
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:10,837
Should l mary a teacher
and write alphabets?

1258
02:02:11,033 --> 02:02:13,368
How about MLA's daughter?
- Bloody MLA's daughter!

1259
02:02:13,566 --> 02:02:15,200
That's not permanent, no need.

1260
02:02:15,399 --> 02:02:16,901
All eyes must be on me.

1261
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:19,368
l must look different
even in a crowd.

1262
02:02:19,566 --> 02:02:21,034
l've a proposal of your choice.

1263
02:02:23,033 --> 02:02:25,702
Claps, whistles, catcalls
behind you, always.

1264
02:02:25,899 --> 02:02:27,868
two brothers-in-law
to take care of you,

1265
02:02:28,066 --> 02:02:30,535
they will not allow even
a fly to fall on you.

1266
02:02:31,066 --> 02:02:31,733
What about the girl?

1267
02:02:31,933 --> 02:02:35,369
Money chimes always
in her hand.

1268
02:02:35,566 --> 02:02:36,400
Big family.

1269
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:37,834
Vey famous.

1270
02:02:38,033 --> 02:02:39,934
Their culture is vey different.

1271
02:02:44,666 --> 02:02:49,037
lf anything goes wrong,
your bodies will float in Bhimli beach.

1272
02:02:49,433 --> 02:02:50,734
Convey my inquiries
to my fiancee.

1273
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:13,601

1274
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:33,702
Bloody cheats.

1275
02:03:34,533 --> 02:03:36,134
You cheated me.

1276
02:03:36,333 --> 02:03:38,635
Claps and whistles?!

1277
02:03:41,133 --> 02:03:43,001
Money rolls always
in my wife's hands.

1278
02:03:45,899 --> 02:03:49,336
Great brothers-in-law
to beat as l step out.

1279
02:03:49,533 --> 02:03:51,134
Looks like my funeral band.

1280
02:03:51,333 --> 02:03:52,767
You forgot a thing buddy.

1281
02:03:53,966 --> 02:03:55,767
Didn't l say they'll not allow
even a fly to fall on you?

1282
02:03:55,966 --> 02:03:59,002
l'm lashing myself mercilessly,
how can a fly fall on me?

1283
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:02,102
You know eveything but still
cheated me into this marriage.

1284
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:03,267
What have l done to you?

1285
02:04:03,466 --> 02:04:04,300
Coming dear.

1286
02:04:32,733 --> 02:04:34,101
Come Ashok...please sit here.

1287
02:05:02,699 --> 02:05:05,002
House warming invitation.

Bloody, you've built
a great home.

Greetings Mr. Commissioner.
You're vey strict.

1294
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:35,001
What else then? l'm from Nellore.

1295
02:05:35,199 --> 02:05:38,603
Once in 1987 l locked horns with
CM himself...- Please sit down.

1296
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:39,700
Sit..?

1297
02:05:39,933 --> 02:05:40,933
Let's sit and discuss.

1298
02:05:41,133 --> 02:05:41,967
Where is your house?

1299
02:05:42,199 --> 02:05:43,935
l'll demolish half of it
since it encroaches the road.

1300
02:05:44,133 --> 02:05:46,368
Taunting me...
go...go away.

1301
02:05:47,899 --> 02:05:49,368
Why are you standing sir?
Please sit down.

1302
02:05:49,566 --> 02:05:50,833
Calling me...? l'm coming.

l'm here only.

1304
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,135
Bring a chair for
the Commissioner.

1305
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:00,567
l'll sit man.

1306
02:06:00,766 --> 02:06:03,668
Eveyone is bothered about sitting.

1307
02:06:03,866 --> 02:06:06,635
When l see a chair,
my bottom is shaking up.

1308
02:06:06,833 --> 02:06:09,268
Chatrapathi gave me
the scare of my life.

1309
02:06:14,533 --> 02:06:15,767
Has he come?

1310
02:06:43,133 --> 02:06:47,270
No need to make money
in your bad undemorld,

1311
02:06:47,633 --> 02:06:51,536
l invited you to show
that one can grow honestly like me.

1312
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:54,400
What did you say?

1313
02:06:54,933 --> 02:06:57,268
You'll look after mother
like a queen, right?

1314
02:06:57,466 --> 02:07:01,403
l've made you not even
to show your face to her.

1315
02:07:02,866 --> 02:07:04,534
l'm nearer to mother.

1316
02:07:04,866 --> 02:07:08,002
You're far away from mother.

1317
02:07:10,266 --> 02:07:12,301
l'm inside home as her son.

1318
02:07:12,899 --> 02:07:15,302
You're outside like a dog.

1319
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:19,869
You can never come near
to mother in this life.

1320
02:07:25,866 --> 02:07:28,802
Son careful, it's my life.

1321
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:46,068
Ashok, come in.

1322
02:07:46,533 --> 02:07:47,700
Salute your brother.

1323
02:07:55,333 --> 02:07:56,567
My elder son.

1324
02:07:57,266 --> 02:08:00,369
Ashok loves him vey much.
- Is it? - Yes.

1325
02:08:09,666 --> 02:08:14,003
We planned to kill a tiger
and it escaped.

1326
02:08:14,199 --> 02:08:17,236
What would a tiger do
to the fox that trapped it?

1327
02:08:17,433 --> 02:08:19,902
lt would tear the
fox into pieces.

1328
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:21,401
lt didn't happen like that.

1329
02:08:22,899 --> 02:08:25,168
He got him contracts
worth billions.

1330
02:08:25,233 --> 02:08:26,834
lt has crowned the fox
as a king.

1331
02:08:27,066 --> 02:08:28,700
What's the connection
between them?

1332
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,902
He said the connection
a knife has with hair.

1333
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:36,203
l must know the connection
by tomorrow's dawn.

1334
02:08:39,699 --> 02:08:41,334
l promised to protect you.

1335
02:08:41,533 --> 02:08:43,101
l'm ready to give
my life also for it.

1336
02:08:43,333 --> 02:08:44,701
Forget about Ras Bihari,

1337
02:08:45,133 --> 02:08:47,802
even if entire Bihar arrives here,
they can't enter this place.

1338
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,135
You submit your tenders.
- Come.

1339
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:15,934
You won Chatrapathi.

1340
02:09:16,366 --> 02:09:19,368
l've become your fan
seeing your courage.

1341
02:09:21,766 --> 02:09:23,200
l've changed completely.

1342
02:09:23,699 --> 02:09:27,970
l just came to know a good for
nothing guy has insulted you.

1343
02:09:29,166 --> 02:09:30,300
l couldn't bear it.

1344
02:09:31,199 --> 02:09:34,036
l got enraged so much that
l wanted to kill him.

1345
02:09:34,933 --> 02:09:38,236
That's why l planned his death.

1346
02:09:39,633 --> 02:09:41,935
Mother and son have gone
to the Kali temple,

1347
02:09:42,133 --> 02:09:44,502
l've planted a bomb
to go off at 1 1 am.

1348
02:09:46,433 --> 02:09:47,767
Bloody fool!

1349
02:09:48,166 --> 02:09:52,003
When Bihar tiger wishes to hunt,
it'll lay a trap.

1350
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:54,301
lt'll never back off.

1351
02:10:18,966 --> 02:10:21,802
Chatrapathi, did l say Kali temple?

1352
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,168
Sory, it's Ramadri temple.

1353
02:10:51,766 --> 02:10:53,334
Did you find them?- No.

1354
02:10:56,966 --> 02:11:01,470
Kali...Ramadri...
vey confusing names.

1355
02:11:01,833 --> 02:11:05,369
lt's Ranganathaswamy temple,
this is correct.

1356
02:11:05,566 --> 02:11:07,467
Only five more minutes...

1357
02:11:58,866 --> 02:12:01,034
Mother...he's Ras Bihari.

1358
02:12:01,233 --> 02:12:01,766
Greetings mother.

1359
02:12:01,966 --> 02:12:04,034
We got all the tenders
with his influence.

1360
02:12:04,233 --> 02:12:05,801
He's not our well wisher,

1361
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,469
he's like my elder brother
and your elder son.

1362
02:12:08,666 --> 02:12:09,733
Bless me mother.

1363
02:12:09,933 --> 02:12:11,000
God bless you son.

1364
02:12:11,433 --> 02:12:13,902
Now you've two sons again, mother.

1365
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:25,904
Ashok Bihari constructions will
become number one company.

1366
02:12:26,166 --> 02:12:27,433
Happy to hear it son.

1367
02:12:28,033 --> 02:12:29,968
You must give life to many people.

1368
02:12:30,333 --> 02:12:31,834
Don't earn enemies.

1369
02:12:32,033 --> 02:12:34,368
No mother, l'll never do that.

1370
02:12:35,133 --> 02:12:38,503
When l've a weapon like him and
an armour like you with me,

1371
02:12:38,699 --> 02:12:41,169
who will dare to oppose me,
tell me mother?

1372
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,101
Why are you here?

1373
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:05,836
You earned a home & made money,
isn't that enough?

1374
02:13:06,166 --> 02:13:07,634
Why have you joined
hands with Ras Bihari?

1375
02:13:07,833 --> 02:13:08,433
Why?

1376
02:13:08,699 --> 02:13:10,802
Are you getting nervous?

1377
02:13:11,266 --> 02:13:12,467
l'm not bothered about that.

1378
02:13:13,366 --> 02:13:15,134
Not for me,
for the sake of people.

1379
02:13:15,333 --> 02:13:16,500
They are breathing fresh air
of freedom just now only.

1380
02:13:16,699 --> 02:13:18,168
lf he comes back?
- Let them die.

1381
02:13:18,433 --> 02:13:20,067
l'm not in that crowd.

1382
02:13:22,566 --> 02:13:23,800
You don't know about him.

1383
02:13:24,133 --> 02:13:25,868
He'll use mother as pawn to
make you dance to his tunes.

1384
02:13:26,066 --> 02:13:28,535
lf you go against him,
mother's life will be in jeopardy.

1385
02:13:28,733 --> 02:13:30,835
He'll kill her. - Let him kill!

1386
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:33,969
My mother is going to die,
not your mother.

1387
02:13:34,533 --> 02:13:44,509
_mARur_
Y l n F n

1388
02:13:46,933 --> 02:13:49,402
Your play goes on till
mother is living happily,

1389
02:13:49,766 --> 02:13:52,468
if anything happens to her,
you will be...

1390
02:13:55,233 --> 02:13:56,233
Get mother here.

1391
02:14:05,966 --> 02:14:08,968
lnstall electric mesh
and arrange eveything.

1392
02:14:09,233 --> 02:14:11,268
l want 24 hour surveillance.

1393
02:14:11,833 --> 02:14:13,668
Go and get an electrician.

1394
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:18,570
You don't know about me.

1395
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:26,240
l know local MLA, MP,
Central Minister, Governor.

1396
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,668
l know only this.

1397
02:14:35,199 --> 02:14:36,701
Take good care of my mother.
- Okay.

1398
02:14:36,899 --> 02:14:38,368
Be alert always. - Okay.

1399
02:14:38,566 --> 02:14:39,366
lf Ras Bihari...

1400
02:14:40,233 --> 02:14:43,603
lf you don't mind,
can l ask you something, son?

1401
02:14:52,100 --> 02:14:54,302
Why did you forcibly
bring us here?

1402
02:14:54,566 --> 02:14:55,466
Can l know?

1403
02:14:58,033 --> 02:15:02,470
lf you're jealous of his prosperity,
take away all our property.

1404
02:15:03,266 --> 02:15:04,500
Please release him.

1405
02:15:07,033 --> 02:15:08,834
We had come from shores across,

1406
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:11,435
if he's unwanted here,

1407
02:15:11,933 --> 02:15:14,302
we'll go away into oblivion.

1408
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:18,936
Son, god snatched away
a son from me,

1409
02:15:19,633 --> 02:15:22,502
l'm unable to bear that sorrow.

1410
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:25,635
lf you take away another son also,

1411
02:15:26,333 --> 02:15:28,668
l don't have the strength to live.

1412
02:15:29,733 --> 02:15:33,369
Please don't harm him,
l beg you.

1413
02:15:45,733 --> 02:15:48,502
Serve food.

1414
02:15:51,066 --> 02:15:51,733
Food?

1415
02:15:56,933 --> 02:16:00,836
Mother is refusing to eat food.

1416
02:16:03,433 --> 02:16:07,370
l promised her a queen's life
but she's starving now.

1417
02:16:11,966 --> 02:16:12,900
Let your hands get paralyzed,

1418
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:14,301
let you be reduced to ash,

1419
02:16:14,500 --> 02:16:16,702
bloody bastard,
Iet bad time befall on you,

1420
02:16:16,899 --> 02:16:17,867
leave me.

1421
02:16:21,733 --> 02:16:24,535
Why are you pushing me down?
Bloody...

1422
02:16:25,566 --> 02:16:28,602
You...? Why are you here?

1423
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:31,769
Forget about me,
how come you are here?

1424
02:16:32,533 --> 02:16:36,603
Chatrapathi has planned
to usurp my papad shop.

1425
02:16:36,799 --> 02:16:38,201
l didn't agree,

1426
02:16:38,399 --> 02:16:42,804
so he has kidnapped and
made me starve for 3 days.

1427
02:16:43,399 --> 02:16:45,135
l'm hungy. - Poor girl.

1428
02:16:47,166 --> 02:16:49,301
Eveything is here, you eat.

1429
02:16:50,899 --> 02:16:54,436
Oh No! These people
are not trustworthy.

1430
02:16:54,633 --> 02:16:56,835
lf l die all the problems will end,

1431
02:16:57,133 --> 02:16:58,868
so they would've
poisoned the food.

1432
02:16:59,066 --> 02:17:01,067
They haven't poisoned it,
you eat.

1433
02:17:01,533 --> 02:17:02,433
l'll not eat.

1434
02:17:03,133 --> 02:17:04,667
You're having silly doubts.

1435
02:17:04,866 --> 02:17:06,367
l'll eat first to prove.

1436
02:17:17,733 --> 02:17:20,602
Nothing happened to me,
food is fine, you eat.

1437
02:17:24,766 --> 02:17:26,100
May be the sambar
is poisoned.

1438
02:17:32,833 --> 02:17:33,600
What about the chutney?

1439
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:40,168
Not poisoned.

1440
02:17:40,399 --> 02:17:41,367
What about the cury?

1441
02:17:42,066 --> 02:17:42,800
Soup?

1442
02:17:43,433 --> 02:17:43,933
Pickle?

1443
02:17:44,133 --> 02:17:46,602
Curd, l can't eat without that.

1444
02:17:46,899 --> 02:17:49,302
Pudding...? - Enough?

1445
02:17:49,533 --> 02:17:51,701
May god bless Chatrapathi's mother.

1446
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,402
Though l'm an enemy,
what a grand feast!

1447
02:17:57,933 --> 02:18:00,268
l too had a go at food
talking to you.

1448
02:18:00,466 --> 02:18:01,900
This is the right way.

1449
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:04,602
They will scare us
the more we get afraid.

1450
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:07,202
Let's eat to our heart's
content thrice a day,

1451
02:18:07,399 --> 02:18:09,602
unable to feed us,
they will release us.

1452
02:18:10,033 --> 02:18:11,000
What do you say?

1453
02:18:13,233 --> 02:18:14,601
No problem. - Give it to me.

1454
02:18:20,833 --> 02:18:23,435
You've fed my starving mother,

1455
02:18:23,666 --> 02:18:26,068
what do you want
for this great help?

1456
02:18:26,933 --> 02:18:28,968
You're about to say
that, aren't you?

1457
02:18:29,733 --> 02:18:30,400
Go ahead.

1458
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:33,869
A smoking beedi in mouth,

1459
02:18:34,766 --> 02:18:37,902
a red mouth after
chewing betel leaves,

1460
02:18:38,433 --> 02:18:42,069
a checked lungi to take off as
and when you get into the mood.

1461
02:18:42,399 --> 02:18:52,376
_mARur_
Y l n F n

Laser sharp eyed
mischievous young stud...

02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,437
Stay put in my heart
and explore me...

1466
02:19:27,899 --> 02:19:30,369
Adding hot water to cool water...

1467
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:35,069
Making the cool to hot up...

1468
02:19:36,966 --> 02:19:41,603
Chew away your smiling lips...

1469
02:20:41,633 --> 02:20:43,368
Can you pluck the fruit?

1470
02:20:43,566 --> 02:20:45,668
Can you take off it's skin?

1471
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:50,404
Can you reduce the
madness l've on you?

1472
02:20:50,833 --> 02:20:55,003
l can pluck the fruit,
l can take out it's skin...

1473
02:20:55,433 --> 02:20:59,703
l can be a man in your bed and
take you to the world of bliss...

1474
02:21:00,433 --> 02:21:04,270
Take me and enjoy
my beautiful youth...

1475
02:21:04,966 --> 02:21:08,869
Your beauty is mind blowing...

1476
02:21:09,433 --> 02:21:13,236
Take chance and
go for it man...

1477
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:45,535
Can you dare to touch?

1478
02:21:45,733 --> 02:21:47,868
Can you cross the boundaries?

1479
02:21:48,366 --> 02:21:52,737
Can you hit the
bulls eye of love?

1480
02:21:52,933 --> 02:21:57,070
l can catch you,
l can pull your plait...

1481
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:01,770
l can hit the bulls eye
ofyour love...

1482
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:06,336
Who else is there for
you other than me?

1483
02:22:07,166 --> 02:22:10,802
That's why l'm following
a lady's advice.

1484
02:22:11,633 --> 02:22:15,570
Take me closing the door.

1485
02:23:06,966 --> 02:23:09,001
Ladies & Gentlemen,

1486
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:10,367

1487
02:23:10,566 --> 02:23:14,069
please make
generous donations,

1488
02:23:14,666 --> 02:23:18,669
l've to look after the needs
of all these fools.

1489
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:29,476
_mARur_
Y l n F n

1490
02:23:29,899 --> 02:23:31,401
This man isn't from
my In-law's family,

1491
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:32,901
he looks different.

1492
02:23:33,566 --> 02:23:34,233
Who is he?

1493
02:23:35,666 --> 02:23:38,735
Stop! One step and the
entire building will be blown

1494
02:23:38,933 --> 02:23:41,168
l'm not bothered to die,
l'll kill eveyone here.

1495
02:23:41,366 --> 02:23:42,734
One switch and eveything
will go to smithereens.

1496
02:23:42,933 --> 02:23:47,170
Guns down boys,
call Chatrapathi.

1497
02:23:47,366 --> 02:23:50,969
Tell him to come out,
is he afraid of death?

1498
02:23:51,166 --> 02:23:53,635
ls he hiding? Where's he?
- Where's mother? - Downstairs.

1499
02:23:53,833 --> 02:23:54,400
Come out man.

1500
02:23:57,100 --> 02:23:58,134
Come man.

1501
02:23:58,333 --> 02:23:59,333
l was waiting for you...

1502
02:24:01,899 --> 02:24:04,002
Why did you allow him
to reach here?- Suddenly...

1503
02:24:10,466 --> 02:24:13,635
Seal all the city roads,
they shouldn't cross the city.

1504
02:24:24,566 --> 02:24:27,869
Sacrifice your lives to save mother
from Chatrapathi. - Okay boss.

1505
02:24:28,066 --> 02:24:28,933
Go mother.

1506
02:24:29,833 --> 02:24:30,400
Go mother.

1507
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:31,233
Come.

1508
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:32,333
Okay.

1509
02:24:37,633 --> 02:24:40,469
Thank you brother,
you saved me at the right time.

1510
02:24:41,466 --> 02:24:43,901
Seal all the sides of the factoy.

1511
02:24:44,100 --> 02:24:45,501
Kill him the moment
you see him.

1512
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:46,367
Go.

1513
02:25:29,233 --> 02:25:31,168
He's attacking from
behind like a jackal.

1514
02:25:32,799 --> 02:25:36,136
Not a iackal, but tiger!

1515
02:25:37,633 --> 02:25:40,135
He's attacking
like a tiger on hunt.

1516
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:42,868
To trap the tiger in the forest,

1517
02:25:43,133 --> 02:25:45,668
we must cut a goat
and lay a bait.

1518
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:49,403
Tiger will come for the
smell of the blood.

1519
02:25:49,933 --> 02:25:53,803
Then we can poach and kill it.

1520
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,037
That's it, that's the
way to kill him.

1521
02:25:58,933 --> 02:26:02,636
But, where is the bait?
l mean the goat.

1522
02:26:05,799 --> 02:26:08,068
You're the goat.

1523
02:26:10,933 --> 02:26:14,002
What's this?
Aren't we brothers?

1524
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:18,237
Were you born to my
mother, bloody crook?

1525
02:26:20,066 --> 02:26:21,834
You're a good for
nothing useless guy.

1526
02:26:22,466 --> 02:26:26,570
Chatrapathi got you contracts
and made you a rich man.

1527
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,702
When l inquired about
his weakness,

1528
02:26:29,966 --> 02:26:32,935
l unravelled your
relationship with him.

1529
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,935
Othemise why do l need you?

1530
02:26:35,366 --> 02:26:36,967
Are you any god's incarnation?

1531
02:26:37,166 --> 02:26:39,234
ls your mother a goddess
Kamakshi of Kanchi?

1532
02:26:39,466 --> 02:26:40,366
Bloody!

1533
02:26:42,466 --> 02:26:44,367
He'll come now.

1534
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,935
Kill him boys!

1535
02:27:58,433 --> 02:27:59,934
Mother!

1536
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:17,467
He's killing my son.

1537
02:28:17,666 --> 02:28:20,735
l don't mind losing my life,
please save my son.

1538
02:28:20,933 --> 02:28:22,634
Please sit here, come on.

1539
02:28:56,566 --> 02:28:57,733
No...don't kill me.

1540
02:29:05,899 --> 02:29:08,802
Don't kill my son.

1541
02:29:59,366 --> 02:30:00,734
My son Ashok!

1542
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:02,901
You're not hurt, are you?

1543
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:10,835
What have we done to you?

1544
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:15,169
Why are you after his life?

1545
02:30:34,666 --> 02:30:35,666
This belongs to Shiva.

1546
02:30:36,766 --> 02:30:39,335
12 years back l gave
it to my son.

1547
02:30:40,566 --> 02:30:41,833
How did you get it?

1548
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:44,300
Tell me.

1549
02:30:45,333 --> 02:30:46,133
Did you find it?

1550
02:30:47,533 --> 02:30:48,800
Did you steal it?

1551
02:30:51,633 --> 02:30:54,369
You're lying,
you stole it, didn't you?

1552
02:30:55,466 --> 02:30:56,466
Swear.

1553
02:30:57,966 --> 02:31:02,003
Whether l swear or not,
l'll tell only the truth.

1554
02:31:17,833 --> 02:31:21,136
Whether l swear or not,
l'll tell only the truth.

1555
02:31:32,899 --> 02:31:36,236
What a blunder l've committed!

1556
02:31:37,933 --> 02:31:40,568
l've killed you myself.

1557
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:42,167
Don't cy mother.

1558
02:31:42,966 --> 02:31:45,401
l pe_ormed your funeral rites
even when you're alive.

1559
02:31:45,966 --> 02:31:48,601
l cursed you death.

1560
02:31:48,899 --> 02:31:50,201
l'm a sinner.

1561
02:31:54,200 --> 02:31:57,303
Get up son...you must live...

1562
02:31:57,633 --> 02:32:00,369
...or else the word MOTHER will
Iose it's meaning.

1563
02:32:00,766 --> 02:32:01,366
Get up son.

1564
02:32:01,566 --> 02:32:02,133
Mother.

1565
02:32:03,833 --> 02:32:06,902
l'm feeling sleepy,
l'll sleep on your lap, mother.

1566
02:32:20,633 --> 02:32:23,502
Though l took the wrong way...

1567
02:32:23,799 --> 02:32:26,702
Though l disowned you
as a mother...

1568
02:32:26,899 --> 02:32:33,172
Never let down your mother
who committed the mistake...

1569
02:32:34,266 --> 02:32:40,572
l'll come back into your
world as your child...

1570
02:32:50,866 --> 02:32:54,035
This mother's curse will ruin you.

1571
02:32:54,433 --> 02:33:00,872
Trust me son,
l swear on you, son.

1572
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:09,674
l mistook eveything black as water
and white as milk,

1573
02:33:09,933 --> 02:33:12,902
that's why l'm repenting
for it now.

1574
02:33:20,633 --> 02:33:24,603
Are you the leader Chatrapathi?

1575
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:27,702
A leader must be like me.

1576
02:33:28,566 --> 02:33:31,735
Ras Bihari...Bihar's...

1577
02:33:33,433 --> 02:33:34,667
Leave me now.

1578
02:33:35,566 --> 02:33:37,801
l'll kill you in one shot.

1579
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:39,567
One moment you delay...

1580
02:33:39,766 --> 02:33:43,369
...finding your remains for burial
will become impossible.

1581
02:33:52,233 --> 02:33:54,335
Will you kill me?

1582
02:33:54,966 --> 02:33:56,133
Kill me in one shot.

1583
02:33:56,333 --> 02:33:59,335
Will you cut my body
into pieces?

1584
02:34:03,866 --> 02:34:04,566
Will you kill me?

1585
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:07,668
Finished so fast?

1586
02:34:08,233 --> 02:34:09,667
Don't you've strength
to get up also?

1587
02:34:10,266 --> 02:34:13,836
Will you get up if
l beat your mother?

1588
02:35:47,066 --> 02:35:48,333
After three months...

1589
02:35:48,666 --> 02:35:51,702
Come fast, you're getting
Iate to see the bride...

1590
02:35:51,899 --> 02:35:54,202
You know about my son.

1591
02:35:54,399 --> 02:35:56,468
We'll go only if the girl
matches him in all aspects.

1592
02:35:56,666 --> 02:35:58,968
l know your choice
of the daughter-in-law.

1593
02:36:00,366 --> 02:36:02,334
l'll not accept if the girl
is mischievous like Neelu

1594
02:36:02,533 --> 02:36:03,600
No way.

1595
02:36:05,866 --> 02:36:08,468
She's complete opposite to her.

1596
02:36:08,666 --> 02:36:11,535
lf you see her once,
you'll not say no. Come.

1597
02:36:14,866 --> 02:36:17,068
ls she more
beautiful than me?

1598
02:36:19,233 --> 02:36:20,300
What's all this?

1599
02:36:20,500 --> 02:36:21,634
Bride seeing ceremony.

1600
02:36:21,966 --> 02:36:24,001
Whose plan is this?
- Mother's.

1601
02:36:24,433 --> 02:36:27,836
Will you toe your
mother's line blindly?

1602
02:36:28,033 --> 02:36:28,833
l'll stab you.

1603
02:36:29,433 --> 02:36:30,233
What's this?

1604
02:36:30,433 --> 02:36:32,701
We are going to see a bride for
my younger son not the elder son.

1605
02:36:36,966 --> 02:36:37,933
ls it?

1606
02:36:38,133 --> 02:36:40,568
Oh the girl is blushing!
