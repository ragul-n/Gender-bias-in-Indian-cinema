1
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,167
-Sir, you are her father, right?
-Yes.

2
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:37,500
And, your name is Sivaprasad.

3
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:43,292
Sandra liked the last
profile that was suggested to her.

4
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,000
He is a Malayali, settled in Bangalore.

5
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,958
Yeah, she created an account on her own.

6
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,792
Now she's bored and has
linked my phone number to the account.

7
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:54,542
That's how the process of finding
a groom has expedited.

8
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,292
But some boys are just interested
in casual dating.

9
00:02:58,417 --> 00:02:59,542
I really don't know how to handle them.

10
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:02,750
-YOU LOOK VERY BEAUTIFUL.
-WHY AREN'T YOU REPLYING?

11
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,125
They don't even give me the time
to tell them that I'm her father.

12
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:06,875
She finds it very funny.

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,875
You'll find a guy named Tijo
in that list.

14
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,708
He's unbearable.

15
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:11,833
Let me see.

16
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,042
<i>Did you have your dinner?</i>

17
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:15,333
<i>No, I will have it now.</i>

18
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,208
<i>What happened?</i>

19
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:21,625
<i>Some guests were home.</i>

20
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,125
<i>What are you up to now?</i>

21
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:25,375
<i>I was about to take a shower.</i>

22
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,708
<i>Even I wish the same.</i>

23
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,208
<i>What do you mean?</i>

24
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,458
<i>To see you bathe.</i>

25
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:34,708
We will deal with it, sir.
Please call Jaffer.

26
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,667
Okay.

27
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:39,500
Vincy is calling you.

28
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,542
I am coming, ma'am.

29
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,417
Who's this girl?
She is very pretty.

30
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,417
She is our top client.
Keep her photo back.

31
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,583
She has a beautiful smile.

32
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:50,958
Am I speaking with Tijo?

33
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:51,875
<i>Yes.</i>

34
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,500
I am Sandra's brother.

35
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,042
<i>But she doesn't have a brother.</i>

36
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,792
Who told you she doesn't
have a brother?

37
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,958
-<i>Who's this?</i>
-If you call on this number again

38
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:00,125
I will beat you!

39
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,458
<i>Okay, I won't call again.</i>

40
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,083
<i>Okay, brother.</i>

41
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,458
Sir, please note down my number.

42
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,458
Premium members are given special care.

43
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,208
Please have some tea.

44
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,958
Have you checked properly?
It's not clear.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,833
Yes.

46
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,500
The bride's face is not clear
in this photograph.

47
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,750
You will face problems while registering.

48
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:26,958
Do you have a photo where she's
looking at the camera?

49
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:31,292
Is this fine?

50
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,667
Yeah, this is better.

51
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,042
-Can you mail it to us?
-Okay.

52
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,250
Do you have WhatsApp?

53
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,750
There's no need for that.
Please mail it to us.

54
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,208
You can leave now.

55
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:43,375
Will you also elope and get
married like your friend?

56
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:46,167
No, I am a decent girl.
I will have an arranged marriage.

57
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,250
Can we open this with a ruler?

58
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,583
Sir, it's my boss's car.
I can't do that.

59
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,875
Ma'am, please open the door.

60
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,625
Please open the door.

61
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,000
Nonsense!

62
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:02,625
Another customer is calling me.
I have to go.

63
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,917
Why are they standing outside?

64
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:09,208
Hey.

65
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:10,708
What's happening?

66
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,250
She's just showing off.

67
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,000
She said her sari was loose
and asked us to get out.

68
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,500
Now she has center locked the car.

69
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,208
Please help us.

70
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:20,458
What's the matter?

71
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,875
You can come in.
Ask them to leave.

72
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,125
Wait here.

73
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,542
-Get in fast.
-Hey, I...

74
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,375
Lock the car.

75
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,542
What's the matter?

76
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,417
There are two things. I will
say the second thing first.

77
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
He's an idiot.

78
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,083
He knows that we are getting
married without informing the family.

79
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:41,875
He has posted a photo on <i>Facebook</i>.

80
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,417
Now I will tell you first thing.

81
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
He smoked weed.

82
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,833
-Really?
-Yeah.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,875
Monkey!

84
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,000
After we got married at the temple,
I went to the washroom

85
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,667
and he went to meet his friends.

86
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,708
Ever since he came back,
he was acting really slow.

87
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,875
While coming down the stairs,
he was telling me...

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,458
"Why isn't this coming to an end?"

89
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,208
There were only three steps there.

90
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:04,667
So, I want justice!

91
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:08,042
I will take care of this.

92
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,417
Finally, she opened the door!

93
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,292
-Is everything all right now?
-Thanks, ma'am.

94
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,417
Can you breathe out?

95
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
-What?
-Please breathe out.

96
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,208
Oh, my God!
Did the tire burst?

97
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,333
-Are you okay now?
-I am not okay.

98
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,875
Please get inside.

99
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,750
Damn! I shouldn't have smoked.

100
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,167
Let's go.

101
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,625
-Aren't you happy now?
-Does it hurt?

102
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,708
Not at all.

103
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:38,667
Here it is.

104
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,667
Do you have any other address proof?

105
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,542
I have my company ID but it
doesn't have the address details.

106
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,208
Father's name is not mentioned
in this ID.

107
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,792
Doesn't it have my mother's
name as Neena in it?

108
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:49,208
As far as I understand,
it's legally all right.

109
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:51,333
According to me, it's not right.

110
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,542
-Please look into this.
-Are you all Malayalis?

111
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:54,542
Yes, sir.

112
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,542
Sir, this looks like a clear
case of runaway wedding.

113
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,167
We need someone who can take
their responsibility.

114
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,333
Sir, my father lacked responsibility.

115
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,500
-My mother is a single parent.
-I don't think we should encourage this.

116
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,125
We will look into all those matters later.

117
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,375
Please sign these documents first.

118
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,500
Okay, you're married now.

119
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,583
Please don't get emotional.

120
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,583
We had just met on the
matrimonial site, right?

121
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:37,792
We didn't profess our love.

122
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,750
Wait! I never said that you're ugly.

123
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,042
I only said, I look prettier.

124
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,292
Isn't that true?
Won't you feel insecure?

125
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,292
That's all.
Please don't call me again.

126
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,542
Hey, Vincy?

127
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,458
<i>Yes.</i>

128
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,250
I have messaged you a number.
Please deal with him.

129
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,833
-<i>Okay, wait a second.</i>
-Yes?

130
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,167
<i>Do you want a collector?</i>

131
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:06,000
He's divorced. But he's a Christian,
young and belongs to the elite class.

132
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,375
<i>What do you think?</i>

133
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,000
No. I want a single guy.

134
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,417
Okay, fine.

135
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,625
-Hello.
-Hello.

136
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,250
Tell us about yourself.

137
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,583
My name is Neena and
I am originally from Kerala.

138
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:03,083
I learnt French at the <i>Alliance Fran√ßaise</i>.

139
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,000
Thus I can handle French better now.

140
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,083
Okay.

141
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:09,417
I was a school teacher in Kerala
for the past twenty years.

142
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,917
And I have a daughter.

143
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,875
Is your daughter here
in Chennai with you?

144
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:19,417
Yes, it's been three months
since we shifted to Chennai.

145
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:24,375
My daughter works in a bank here.

146
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,375
Ma'am, is it <i>sous, soues, suis</i>?

147
00:09:31,542 --> 00:09:33,083
-It's <i>suis</i>.
-Thank you, ma'am.

148
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,458
You've topped and you speak
French more fluently than me.

149
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:39,375
Thank you, ma'am.

150
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,333
Most probably, you
will be asked to join here!

151
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,750
How did it go?

152
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:45,917
It was all right.

153
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,125
Ma'am, you look very pretty.

154
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,917
When I was working in the hotels,
I used to park vehicles.

155
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,583
Most of the vehicles work
automatically nowadays.

156
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,375
Automatic vehicles are
very difficult to park.

157
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,333
It's easy to drive manual cars.

158
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,583
Hey... brother!

159
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,958
How was your exam?

160
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,083
You're a smart girl.

161
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,042
-Come.
-Manuel--

162
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,042
It's very difficult
to drive manual vehicles.

163
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,375
Brother, my name is Manuel.

164
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,333
Sorry, sir.

165
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:04,750
This guy is impossible.

166
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,958
-Are you taking it for repair?
-Yes.

167
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,000
Did you walk around Madras today?

168
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,292
No, I was staying in a suite room
offered by the company.

169
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,167
I had a grand breakfast.

170
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,792
It's very hot outside in Madras.

171
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,875
I took a long nap.

172
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,333
That's because your body
has adjusted to Pune's climate.

173
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,292
Isn't this a nice area?

174
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,250
It's surrounded by trees
and there's a beach nearby.

175
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,875
This is a good apartment.
It has a rich look as well.

176
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,125
That's actually Nikki's plan.

177
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,292
Her idea is to project elegance to the
marriage proposals coming to visit home.

178
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:37,250
She's so determined to find
a groom for herself.

179
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,917
Look, this lift isn't working.

180
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,292
Which floor is our home?

181
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,583
Come. It will be a good exercise.

182
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:46,292
Looking at my diet, I don't think
this will help.

183
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,167
Hi, ma'am.

184
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,542
Hey, Neena. Please come.

185
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,625
She's the house owner's wife.

186
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:54,875
She had been to China.

187
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,375
When did you come back?

188
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,083
I got back this morning.

189
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,583
I was in China for the past
four months

190
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,083
and I missed doing this.

191
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:06,208
That's why, I drew <i>rangoli</i>
outside all the flats.

192
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:07,875
I have drawn here as well.
I will be back.

193
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,667
Why did they go to China?

194
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,000
Her daughter is in China.

195
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,375
Her child started speaking in Chinese,

196
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,208
that's why she called her
parents to teach her Tamil.

197
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,375
Come inside.

198
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,333
This is so beautiful.
Can't we keep this in our home?

199
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,667
Only if we keep it here,
people will be able to see it.

200
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:27,708
Hi, aunty!

201
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:29,292
How are you?

202
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh, my God!

203
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,458
She's the one who's coming
to stay in the nearby flat.

204
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:40,375
She's a Malayali.

205
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,500
It's been two months that you're
saying the same thing.

206
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:45,583
I asked for that flat first.

207
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,625
I was given least priority
and sent to the second floor.

208
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:50,500
No, dear.
That guy convinced us amicably.

209
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,208
He looked very innocent.

210
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,833
There's nothing on your leg.
Take it off.

211
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:57,417
Besides, both of them are orphans.

212
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,083
Their grandmother is taking
care of them.

213
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:01,500
Such a story can be made
into a TV series.

214
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,917
We can make a cinema
out of my life.

215
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,167
Nowadays, series have a better
reach than cinemas.

216
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,375
My uncle has come home.

217
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,958
I met your uncle.

218
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,042
-You met him?
-Yes.

219
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,292
What is she doing?

220
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,292
Why are you taking the whole
chocolate box? It's for everyone.

221
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,833
All the hens have large tummies, right?

222
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,833
Hey. Don't pinch it.

223
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,333
When are you going to join
there as a French teacher?

224
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,833
I need to attend the
orientation class first.

225
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,917
There will be two separate batches.

226
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:30,083
I have to carry lunch.
So, I bought this!

227
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,292
You already bought a lunch box?

228
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,333
It's a good color.

229
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,167
Why did you make me choose
Sanskrit as the second language?

230
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,500
If it was French, I could have added
that in my matrimonial profile.

231
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,750
It would have been exciting.

232
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,708
I thought you would teach me Sanskrit.

233
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,750
I only know a sacred chant in Sanskrit.

234
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:50,500
You can learn any language,
if you're passionate

235
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,125
or if it's a necessity.

236
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,542
You don't need to prepare
anything more.

237
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,500
I will show them to you.

238
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:01,958
Lachu, just check out the food
prepared by your aunty and Nikki.

239
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:03,750
-Please wish them.
-Sure.

240
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,750
I can't see anything in this.

241
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,583
Oh, God! I lost the connection.

242
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,708
What's the Wi-Fi password?

243
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:12,833
It was "Hot water" but she changed it.

244
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,125
Did you change it to "Cold water"?

245
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,250
-No.
-Then?

246
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,625
LDF will come and set everything right.

247
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,542
Everything is in small
letters and without space.

248
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,667
"Hot water" was a better password.

249
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,750
Is that all you eat?

250
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,917
Our mileage increases
as we get older.

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,917
I eat less.

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,083
My mileage is still very low.
Please pass the cutlet.

253
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,250
Give it to me.

254
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,417
Take it with the other hand.

255
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,792
This tastes similar
to Miss Sheela's food.

256
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,458
You are rightly born to your mother.

257
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,208
Everyone was present there
the other day.

258
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,292
I heard that all of you slept
on the floor, like old times.

259
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,958
That's because everyone was
drunk, including the ladies.

260
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:55,417
We were hardly in our senses.

261
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,708
-Did you get the pickle?
-Have it.

262
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,250
-That's enough.
-I will go and get it.

263
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:06,000
She still doesn't like
going to the festival, right?

264
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,375
No, when she goes to Ernakulam,
she meets her teacher there.

265
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,000
Her husband passed away, right?

266
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,042
Yes. She used to call me.

267
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,208
A new tenant has come
upstairs for rent.

268
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,250
She still asks me to
come and stay there.

269
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,000
She feels lonely in that huge house.

270
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,083
That's right.

271
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,083
Dad sleeps in the smallest room
of my house.

272
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,458
Do you need pickle?

273
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:28,208
No, let me take a break for some time.

274
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,958
-Listen.
-Yes.

275
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,083
Your grandmother has asked you
and your mother

276
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,000
to come to the festival next time.

277
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,250
I can't fake sentiments.

278
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,708
They haven't accepted mom as well.

279
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:41,417
She would go only when everyone
leaves the house.

280
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,667
But she is very smart.

281
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,583
Aunt Sheela would always say

282
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:48,167
that she would be sad the morning
everyone would leave.

283
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,708
The same person keeps asking me now

284
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,208
as to when I will leave.

285
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,417
That's because she will
reach there once we leave.

286
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,125
That's our favorite time.
Just us, mom and daughter.

287
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:01,167
Please take this along.

288
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,500
Your mother is very innocent.

289
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,917
-She fell in love in tenth class.
-What?

290
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,417
She had many affairs
during her college time.

291
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:17,000
After that she eloped with a guy, got
married and then divorced him.

292
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,042
Why can't you learn
something from her?

293
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,250
What are you saying?

294
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:21,833
Nothing.

295
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,917
I was asking her to reduce the
size of the Wi-Fi password.

296
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:41,833
Wake up, Aakashavani.

297
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,417
Why are you disturbing me?

298
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,083
You wish to sleep longer, right?

299
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,625
Yeah.

300
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,000
Wait a second.

301
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,250
I will click your photo and
send it to the family group.

302
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:54,958
-Let your reputation be tarnished.
-Oh, no!

303
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:57,333
Please don't ruin my reputation.
I am waking up.

304
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,833
Coffee is ready. Get ready quickly.

305
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:01,208
We will shift today at any cost.

306
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,250
Please wait till the climax shoot is over.

307
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,333
One episode can be shot in the time
we reach here from Besant Nagar.

308
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,417
What did you tell my aunty
before you came here?

309
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,833
I told her that we will be back soon.

310
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,458
No! You said, "Don't get tensed
about the kids.

311
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,833
I will take care of them."

312
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:18,375
Yeah. After that I told her
that we will be back soon.

313
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:19,583
And did you ever go back?

314
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,625
Now even we can't
go home because of you.

315
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,125
You're always busy with the shoot.

316
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,917
Oh, my God! Is it a crime
that I became an artist?

317
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,333
I have to bear all the abuses.

318
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,958
You're a drama queen!

319
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:32,167
That explains how you got a role
in the series.

320
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,750
Come out. I need to use this bathroom.

321
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,125
<i>Even I want to use this bathroom.</i>

322
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,000
I am tired of these two.

323
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,792
Anyway, you're standing idle.
Please iron the uniform.

324
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,875
No.

325
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,833
I couldn't cook a proper breakfast.

326
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,333
You might have added excess
quantity of water.

327
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,167
I will buy some more semolina
and make it right.

328
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:50,458
Please iron it.

329
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,458
Okay, do one thing.
I will prepare the breakfast.

330
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,833
Please iron the uniform.

331
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,250
Lazy woman!

332
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:56,917
Get lost.

333
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,083
Get out of the bathroom.

334
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,042
<i>Aakashavani, let me concentrate.</i>

335
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,333
This boy eats and shits a lot.

336
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:06,750
You added oats, right?

337
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,750
-I thought the same.
-Rubbish!

338
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,625
The semolina was flooded with water.

339
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,542
I really worked hard
to make it edible.

340
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,250
How's it dear?

341
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Very nice.

342
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,292
I have to post this
recipe in <i>WhatsApp</i>.

343
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,750
Otherwise even I will forget it.

344
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,583
Why can't you stop acting in serials
and make us nutritious food?

345
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,958
Everything is an adjustment now.

346
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,625
I have to make nutritious food for
two filthy grownups, right?

347
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Aakashavani, you meant "Fraud", right?

348
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,125
Absolutely right!
You are still my dear child.

349
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:40,917
Who is a fraud?

350
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,458
At least today board
the school van on time, fatso!

351
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:46,542
Oh, my God! It's already 8:45 a.m.

352
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,875
I have a shoot scheduled at 9:30 a.m.

353
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,708
Today, I am supposed
to kill my son on it.

354
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,333
Eat fast and leave.
Let me get ready.

355
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:54,667
It's been a month since you
have been trying to kill him.

356
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:55,875
I didn't realize the time at all.

357
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,708
We will shift from this
house at sharp 6 p.m.

358
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:58,625
Yeah.

359
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,750
If the shoot gets delayed today,
come straight to the new house.

360
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:01,875
Get lost!

361
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:05,250
Get up and leave! There's hardly five
minutes more for the van to come.

362
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:06,375
I won't drop you today.

363
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,958
Get lost, you moron!

364
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,667
Oh!

365
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,500
Abusing in Tamil?

366
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:12,583
Did you learn this from school?

367
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,000
Will you abuse again?

368
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,208
Are you learning this at school?

369
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,750
He scratched me.

370
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,375
-Both of them started again!
-Get lost! Look at his nails.

371
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,833
Clean your mouth and leave
or else it will stink.

372
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,417
It is very hot, Dad.

373
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,167
Yes, Dad, I agree with him.

374
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,583
At least one of you wear this.

375
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,958
-Now you can enjoy.
-Let's enjoy.

376
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,458
Helmet for the bald.

377
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,167
-There isn't much difference here.
-This is a little dark.

378
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,083
-But this shouldn't be an issue.
-What?

379
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:08,167
-So, shall I finalize this?
-You're here!

380
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,208
-We've a lot of work to do today.
-Please give this to her.

381
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,167
Oh, nice. You might have
seen this today, right?

382
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,958
Didn't you wear formals today?

383
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,417
Aren't you supposed to
receive the clients today?

384
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,125
-Did you forget?
-Oh, no!

385
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,500
Dhanya, have we booked
premium car for the client?

386
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,125
-Yes.
-Hey!

387
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:34,292
Which car?

388
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,583
Which car?

389
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,042
Yeah, BMW five series.

390
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,125
Brother.

391
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:02,542
Thank God.

392
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,292
Hey.

393
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:15,042
That's awesome! The clients seem
to be really impressed.

394
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,208
Yeah.

395
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,625
Was it an altered vehicle?

396
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:18,917
Yeah, I had to alter it a little bit.

397
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,083
Here you go.

398
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,375
-Fraud, right?
-Yeah.

399
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:27,042
The coloring is very good.

400
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,500
Our kids will be really
talented artists.

401
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:30,208
I will draw and you will color it.

402
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,583
I hope they aren't
color blind like you.

403
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:33,583
You can handle that, right?

404
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,333
My roommate is going
for a date tonight.

405
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,583
And I don't want to sit idle at home.

406
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,292
Can we go tomorrow instead?

407
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,292
WHATEVER HAPPENS, SHIFT TODAY.

408
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,083
Oh, is this the new flat?

409
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,417
The roads are dirty.

410
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,208
Everyone wants to take a photo with you.

411
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:56,667
From now on, I am going to stay here.

412
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,833
-Are you my fan?
-Yes.

413
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:00,917
What?

414
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,167
-Don't we have to arrange all these?
-Yes.

415
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,583
We have a little work here.
Can we all meet later?

416
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:08,208
-Sure.
-I will have it later.

417
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:09,292
-Okay, ma'am.
-What?

418
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,667
-Wasn't this disposed?
-Okay, fine.

419
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:12,875
Who brought this?

420
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,583
I have an idea.

421
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,875
This looks so beautiful.
It is shining like gold.

422
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,167
Our culture teaches us to gift something

423
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,750
to the elders whenever
we go to a new house.

424
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:23,917
That's why I brought this.

425
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,292
-I should actually thank you.
-Why?

426
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:29,125
It's a blessing that we got
our home on the first floor.

427
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,542
But it's going to be
really tough for you.

428
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,167
You can't cook nonvegetarian food at all.

429
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,667
If you cook, the smell will
linger around the whole apartment.

430
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,917
That's correct.

431
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,583
My grandmother loves nonvegetarian food.

432
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:40,542
-Does she love it?
-Yes.

433
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,625
Okay, do one thing.

434
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:43,917
-What?
-You may prepare fish and chicken,

435
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,625
but make sure the
windows are tightly closed.

436
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,250
But please don't make dry fish.

437
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,542
-I can't bear the smell.
-What's that?

438
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,542
It's a type of a seafood.

439
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:54,917
We won't make that.

440
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,292
One of our tenants loves prawn!

441
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,250
-Are you a Christian?
-No, sir, I am a Hindu.

442
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,875
Then, please don't eat beef.
God will not like it.

443
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,375
-That's correct.
-Right!

444
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:05,542
-Okay, I am leaving.
-Wait a second.

445
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:09,167
-Do you make beef using coconut?
-Yes.

446
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,958
Can you give me some beef?

447
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,417
If my wife asks, I will tell her
that it's chicken.

448
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,875
She won't understand the difference.

449
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,708
What is "super"?

450
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,208
I was saying that this is a superb house.

451
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:24,000
Will something happen?

452
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:25,875
I am really hungry.

453
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:30,083
-Is it necessary for the milk to spill?
-Yes.

454
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,958
-Isn't it enough to get it heated?
-Show it to me.

455
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,292
It hasn't turned into butter milk yet.
This is plain milk.

456
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:41,875
May be the milk is a bit inferior.

457
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,292
-We should use a gas stove.
-That's true.

458
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,167
We didn't get the gas cylinder.
We need to get a new connection.

459
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,750
It's a horrendous task.
They will make you run behind them.

460
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,292
That's not a big deal.

461
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,250
There will be a lot of ladies
who love watching serials.

462
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,958
-Am I right, Aakashavani?
-Yeah, I understood your plan.

463
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,083
Why do you call her Aakashavani?

464
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,375
I used to work in the All India Radio.

465
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,417
I used to speak Tamil fluently.

466
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,458
So, when I came here, I was called
to dub for a Tamil serial.

467
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:11,000
The director and the actress who played
the mother-in-law had a terrible fight.

468
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,000
That's when the director saw me.

469
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:14,958
So, he changed the plot of the serial.

470
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,250
Boiled water fell on the
face of the mother-in-law.

471
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:20,333
So, she undergoes plastic surgery and
becomes a new mother-in-law altogether.

472
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:21,417
That's me.

473
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,083
Then I became famous
among the masses.

474
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:27,958
Let's assume that the
milk has spilled out.

475
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,125
That's nice.

476
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,917
We're done with the ritual.
Clap your hands.

477
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,833
-What?
-Place a flower in the middle.

478
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:41,083
-Good idea!
-Aunt, this is superb!

479
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:42,792
Yeah, tell me.

480
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,167
-She is superb.
-Don't mock me.

481
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,375
This is fun!

482
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,583
Bath properly. Use the soap.

483
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,917
Subbu, what are you up to?

484
00:26:57,042 --> 00:26:58,958
Deepa, how are you?

485
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,833
-It's been a while since I saw you.
-I am fine.

486
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
I am coming.

487
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:06,500
Take a look at this.
The cooker is still leaking.

488
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,042
You haven't repaired it properly.

489
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,917
I will repair it by evening.

490
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,208
-Will you repair it properly?
-Yes.

491
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,417
-Please help me!
-Sure.

492
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,417
I will come in the evening.

493
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,208
I am really sorry.
Please get inside.

494
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,458
-Hey.
-Yes.

495
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,917
Someone has turned up.

496
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,167
What's the matter?

497
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:35,458
Wake up. I think they've come
with a marriage proposal.

498
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:37,500
This can be dismissed soon.

499
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,167
Do I need to brush my teeth?

500
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,083
Of course. Wake up.

501
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:43,792
Wake up!

502
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,458
This guy doesn't match your taste.

503
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:47,208
How did this proposal reach this stage?

504
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,792
He's a neighbor.

505
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,958
Whenever he sees me, he jumps
the fence and proposes me.

506
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:53,208
This is the best way to reject him.

507
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,792
How? By calling him to our house?

508
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:55,917
Will you tell him that you don't like him?

509
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,625
I will say that I liked him
but you didn't.

510
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,625
-<i>Zut</i>!
-You're abusing me in French, right?

511
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,042
I am not abusing you.
I was saying that it is not fair.

512
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,375
But it's nice.
It gives me an affectionate feeling.

513
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,833
Please talk to me.
I am also an open person.

514
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
-You're very handsome.
-Yeah.

515
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,083
-You're very cute.
-Oh!

516
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,167
I like smart boys like you.

517
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,875
Oh, wow. Thank you so much.

518
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,167
But I don't know how to tell you.

519
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,417
I need to tell you something.

520
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,208
Please tell me.

521
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:28,083
I like you a lot.

522
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,083
But my mom doesn't like you.

523
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,208
What?

524
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,542
Nikki's character is similar to
that of her mother.

525
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,083
-What?
-Not you but Miss Jayalalitha.

526
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,292
Nikki's just like a bulldozer.

527
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:48,792
If you stand in front of it,
it will crash you into pieces.

528
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,875
-She's not here, right?
-No, she has left.

529
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:53,208
Thank God!
You are like MGR.

530
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:54,917
Your heart melts so soon.

531
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:59,208
Is that the second cooker whistle
we heard from the flat above?

532
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,208
-I think so.
-Oh, no!

533
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:07,708
I am from Rachel Varghese's place.

534
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,333
Please come in.

535
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,458
-Where should I keep this?
-You can keep it inside.

536
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,208
Keep it there.

537
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:22,042
You look so beautiful.
Just like a film actress.

538
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,458
Aunty forced me to take this photo when
I went to give

539
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:26,208
-an application in Stella Maris.
-Oh, I see.

540
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,875
Aunty forced me to
learn dance and music.

541
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:34,167
Please don't wash the utensils.

542
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,833
You will be get late for work.

543
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:36,792
Okay.

544
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,958
I am taking a portion of the prawns
curry for the tenant above.

545
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,875
The egg we used in the cake
was brought from his fridge.

546
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,458
Oh, God!
Where's this cooker's whistle?

547
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:56,792
Where is it?

548
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,708
She messed it up again.

549
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,625
<i>Kissed upon the eyes with glee</i>

550
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,292
<i>Every rising dawn in Madras</i>

551
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,292
<i>The dreams are more colorful</i>

552
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,333
<i>When the ounce of breath</i>
<i>Is you, dear Madras</i>

553
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:13,458
<i>More and more people are coming</i>

554
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:17,125
<i>Embraced are they in her rituals,</i>
<i>With garlanded streets</i>

555
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,417
<i>Kissed upon the eyes with glee</i>

556
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,292
<i>Every rising dawn in Madras</i>

557
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,292
<i>The dreams are more colorful</i>

558
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:26,958
<i>When the ounce of breath</i>
<i>Is you, dear Madras</i>

559
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,333
I want to renew my daughter's profile.

560
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,875
I am not a staff here.
She is the one.

561
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:25,667
<i>Adorned by the scent of Jasmine...</i>

562
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:39,833
<i>Adorned by the scent of Jasmine,</i>

563
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,917
<i>Resonating the voice of Valluvar</i>

564
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,542
<i>Anklets worn by her,</i>
<i>Tuned the legs into rhythm</i>

565
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,375
-<i>At your behest...</i>
-<i>The shades Of flowers are extended</i>

566
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:49,625
-<i>Where the hearts of</i>
-<i>People are encountered,</i>

567
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:53,250
<i>Hopes and wishes galore,</i>
<i>Thousands of them counting</i>

568
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,208
-<i>At her will</i>
-<i>The sights are so scenic</i>

569
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:57,542
-<i>Each spirited molecule</i>
-<i>Has it in them</i>

570
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,292
<i>Happiness and excitement are</i>
<i>Woven together,</i>

571
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:02,875
<i>To wake up loud, leap up deep and fly</i>

572
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:22,375
<i>Kissed upon the eyes with glee</i>

573
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:25,458
<i>Every rising dawn in Madras</i>

574
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:56,250
<i>The beauty of a half sari</i>
<i>Is natural to her</i>

575
00:33:56,708 --> 00:34:01,917
<i>It looked beautiful at a young age</i>

576
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,833
Are you a Malayali?

577
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,000
Yes, Ernakulam.
Where are you from?

578
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,333
This will actually cost
around 1,000 rupees.

579
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:15,292
<i>Eternal is a feeling for you</i>
<i>Dear Tamil girl</i>

580
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:17,583
-<i>Miracle is the wonder</i>
-<i>To define you</i>

581
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:19,542
-<i>Novelty is a tradition</i>
-<i>In everything you do</i>

582
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,208
<i>Each of your pulse is an impulse in us</i>

583
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,208
-My house is at Aluva.
-I don't care.

584
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:25,417
-<i>You are the motherland</i>
-<i>My life has adopted</i>

585
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
-<i>You are the destiny</i>
-<i>My luck has accepted</i>

586
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,458
<i>Madras, you have shone</i>
<i>Brighter than ever</i>

587
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:32,375
<i>As the Mother Goddess</i>

588
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,500
<i>Kissed upon the eyes with glee</i>

589
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,292
<i>Every rising dawn in Madras</i>

590
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,375
<i>Our dreams are more colorful</i>

591
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,250
<i>When the ounce of breath is you</i>
<i>Dear Madras</i>

592
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,667
I have it here. That's not a problem.

593
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,583
<i>More and more people are coming</i>

594
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:05,958
<i>Embraced are they in her rituals</i>
<i>With streets full of garlands</i>

595
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:07,875
Does Aunt dance as well?

596
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:10,917
Will you have some tea?

597
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:12,708
Yeah.

598
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:15,708
Come with me.

599
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,667
-When will Rajesh die?
-He will die soon.

600
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:21,458
You've been saying this
for the last one month.

601
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:22,417
-He is still alive.
-Oh, God!

602
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,458
The episode has to go on.
How can we kill him just like that?

603
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:26,833
Only then the story will be good.

604
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,375
He will be killed soon.

605
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:32,625
We have been talking about death and
and an ambulance is here.

606
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:35,583
Ganga, why is the ambulance here?

607
00:35:35,792 --> 00:35:36,792
Oh, God.

608
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:39,875
This is the new tenant who
is staying in apartment number 103.

609
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,292
Was that apartment occupied?

610
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:42,542
Yes, he's a Malayali.

611
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,375
He has been here for
the last two weeks.

612
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,458
He was in the military.

613
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,917
Our servant's son thrashed him badly.

614
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,833
Really?

615
00:35:50,542 --> 00:35:52,125
Why did he beat him?

616
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,042
Why are you tying the
clothesline so high?

617
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,083
Idiot!

618
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,375
Tie it properly.

619
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:00,833
You act smart in front of others.

620
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:02,208
Does the major live alone in his
apartment?

621
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,292
Even if somebody was there, they
would have left him already.

622
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:05,750
He's such a crass fellow!

623
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,042
He's a drunkard as well.

624
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,500
-Is he an alcoholic?
-Yeah.

625
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,458
The day he was thrashed badly, he
asked Sumesh to tie his shoelace.

626
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:15,042
Sumesh refused to do it and
the major slapped him for that.

627
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,000
He lost a tooth.

628
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:19,417
-Oh, God!
-He spent 12,000 rupees to fix the tooth.

629
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,833
He got really mad.

630
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:22,750
-Did he slap him back?
-Hey!

631
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,458
No, he just got thrashed and came home.

632
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:27,708
He was checking something on his
cell phone when I called him for dinner.

633
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:30,542
He was watching
<i>Tom and Jerry</i> and weeping.

634
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,125
He left immediately.

635
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,000
When the major was back
from the bar last night,

636
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,667
they thrashed him badly.

637
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,417
-Will it be a police case?
-Really?

638
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,667
No, he had told Gangayamaran
not to call the police.

639
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:43,292
Sumesh said he didn't get a
chance to beat the major.

640
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,208
I have sent him to our native.

641
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,208
That's good.

642
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:47,500
Aakashavani, let's go.

643
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,083
-I am coming.
-Come.

644
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,333
Where are you going?

645
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,583
To consult a doctor for her knee pain.

646
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,833
There is a good Malayali
doctor in Shenoy Nagar.

647
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:57,083
-I think it's the same.
-Shankunni clinic.

648
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,417
I know that.

649
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:02,833
I baked a cake.
Your younger brother likes it, right?

650
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:03,750
Can I bring it?

651
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,500
You can bring us a cake
whenever you like.

652
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:06,708
Greedy!

653
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,208
Is that dried prawns?

654
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,500
Yeah, it's Nikki's favorite.

655
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:11,917
May I have some?
I can make chutney in the night.

656
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:14,542
Here you go.

657
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,625
The landlord has warned me
to not make this.

658
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,625
-Hence I am tempted.
-That's nice.

659
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,458
-What happened?
-Will they file a case?

660
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,708
In Dehradun...

661
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:12,250
when some people were clicking pictures
near the bofors gun in the military camp

662
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,417
I could handle them so easily.

663
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,417
I was drunk as well.

664
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:20,417
These were almost kids.

665
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,375
Leave that. It happens.

666
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:23,583
Have you seen this?

667
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,167
They are attacking the lion together,
who had come to hunt its prey.

668
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,167
The lion doesn't show his ego.

669
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,792
It runs away before it gets injured.

670
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,917
You stood there and took
all the thrashings instead.

671
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:40,917
Sometimes I wish to
slap him real bad.

672
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,375
Why aren't you slapping him?

673
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,208
My daughter-in-law will get offended.

674
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,667
He is a test tube baby.

675
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,417
That's why, I control myself.

676
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:49,292
You should learn as well.

677
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,750
We used to get a counseling
in army, right?

678
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,583
It's just the same.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

679
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,292
Let's consult a doctor.

680
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:05,333
I don't need a doctor to control myself.

681
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,125
Let's stop this conversation here.

682
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:15,750
Unnikrishnan, leave him.

683
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,083
Oh, my God.

684
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:23,042
That's nothing. Tell me.

685
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,292
-Mom!
-Oh, no!

686
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:27,125
What happened?

687
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,375
My tooth has come out.

688
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,125
Oh, God!

689
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,250
Let's consult the doctor.

690
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:43,167
Dr. Bose Palakkal speaks five languages.

691
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,958
But he still has a particular
dialect while speaking.

692
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:48,458
I thought this through
the entire morning today.

693
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:51,625
I don't have much of a difficulty now.

694
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,500
Difficulty is not for you but others.

695
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,333
The doctor is very smart.

696
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:57,500
He has good experience
in counseling.

697
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:58,708
Listen.

698
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,625
How about I start doing yoga?

699
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,000
Our Prime Minister will be really happy.

700
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:04,542
There's one more advantage.

701
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,375
There isn't a board outside the
clinic stating that he's a psychiatrist.

702
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,667
His main business is that of
reduction of weight.

703
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,583
You mean, wood works?

704
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:11,500
Not wood works, but reduction
of human weight.

705
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,292
It's one of the best place
in Madras for weight loss.

706
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,583
You asshole!

707
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:27,167
Sometimes I see visuals in a dream.

708
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:31,000
I am driving my old yellow car

709
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,708
through a hilly area.

710
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:35,250
There's snow all around
and it's cloudy as well.

711
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:36,917
It's drizzling.

712
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:39,250
It's freezing cold and the
road is pretty smooth.

713
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,667
I am just driving through it.

714
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:47,042
More like a float, slowly
flowing and coursing away.

715
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,333
This is a bit much.

716
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:53,625
Why do you measure the weight?

717
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,708
Sir, if you want to meet the nutritionist,
you should give all these details.

718
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,458
This is not for weight loss.

719
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:00,875
We're here to treat his mental illness.

720
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,458
The clouds start getting dark.

721
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,375
A sudden thunder strikes.

722
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,625
What happened to the yellow car?

723
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,875
Sir, it fell down the steep pit.

724
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:09,292
Weren't you there inside it?

725
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,042
I got out early to pee.

726
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:19,167
Have one tablet every night.

727
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,250
Okay.

728
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:24,583
-Sir, isn't this the same yellow tablet?
-Yeah.

729
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:26,250
-Then this won't work.
-What?

730
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:29,292
There is another green color
medicine of the same company.

731
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:30,458
-Okay.
-That's actually nice.

732
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,833
Please come and sit here.

733
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:34,000
No, it's okay.

734
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:35,417
Then please lie down.

735
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
Close your eyes.

736
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:39,708
Hello, Malayali Community.

737
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,167
Is Elizabeth ready?

738
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,417
-Shall I call her, sir?
-Please do!

739
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,667
The last patient got into extra time.

740
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,500
-That's why I got late.
-That's okay. We are free today.

741
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:48,625
It's not possible today.

742
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,250
I have to take my family
to the church now.

743
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,125
There is a spiritual
reformation program today.

744
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,083
Can we do it on Monday?

745
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,958
Don't worry!
Oh, is it fractured?

746
00:41:57,042 --> 00:41:58,917
You should attend the
sessions systematically.

747
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,292
Bring a 200 pages
notebook with you.

748
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:03,708
You should always have
a notebook with you.

749
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:05,417
See you!

750
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,208
By the way, there is a pet
shop at the end of this road.

751
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:11,083
The place where you get many
animals for sale.

752
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:12,708
You may buy something from there.

753
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:13,708
Even a fish will do.

754
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,750
Place it in a glass box and we can
actually have fun staring at it.

755
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:17,292
You will come out
of the alcohol addiction.

756
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,250
You may also name the fish, Elizabeth.

757
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,167
Okay.

758
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,750
Don't name it Elizabeth.
My wife's name is Elizabeth.

759
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,000
Name something else.

760
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,417
Okay! Oh, your hand is fractured.
Sorry.

761
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:30,042
He would have named his
fish Elizabeth now.

762
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:34,833
Yes?

763
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:37,250
Hey.

764
00:42:51,458 --> 00:42:53,333
Hey, we got the pet.

765
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:56,708
-Not this!
-Then?

766
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:58,750
That's my pet.

767
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:14,917
What was its name?

768
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,333
Careful.

769
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:42,750
Does it hurt, sir?

770
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:46,125
The dog is well behaved, sir.
He won't do it.

771
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,042
<i>Inonde d'amour.</i>

772
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,583
-Thank you, ma'am.
-You're welcome.

773
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:02,875
-Thank you, ma'am.
-You're welcome.

774
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:03,958
Thank you, ma'am.

775
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:10,417
Yeah?

776
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,333
I saw you sketching there.

777
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:18,000
It is better to do two tasks at a time.

778
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:21,250
It's going to be embarrassing if
you speak French in University of Paris.

779
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:23,583
Give it to me!

780
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,583
You speak well.

781
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,292
What?

782
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:35,292
If you wear this along with
that pastel green sari,

783
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:36,750
you will be prettier than ever!

784
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,833
But your hair has to
be dressed better!

785
00:44:58,583 --> 00:44:59,500
Damn.

786
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,125
What's the name?

787
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:14,125
-What?
-Oh, the dog's name.

788
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:18,333
Jimmy. Just Jimmy.

789
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:19,583
Okay.

790
00:45:20,542 --> 00:45:22,458
If you take him out for walks
often, he will become friendly.

791
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,250
That's why he bit you.

792
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:43,708
You didn't recognize me, right?

793
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,042
No.

794
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:46,208
I don't have a beard in the photo.

795
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:49,667
It's my mom's vow to
get my marriage done.

796
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:50,792
Have a seat.

797
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,583
Sorry, I couldn't recognize you.

798
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,458
My brother uploaded this photo.

799
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,750
He works as a graphic artist
in Hyderabad.

800
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:01,750
Have you seen the film
first part of <i>Baahubali</i>?

801
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:02,750
Yes.

802
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:04,333
-Isn't there an ox in it?
-Yeah.

803
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:05,708
His team did the graphics work of it.

804
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:08,208
The end credits has his name in it.

805
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,875
So, Anson and Alphonse
are brothers, right?

806
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:13,250
No, Alphonse and Anson.

807
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,292
Mom is a devotee of Saint Alphonse.

808
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:17,625
If I were born a girl,

809
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:19,542
I would have been a nun today.

810
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,167
You can be a priest now.

811
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:26,375
I was going to talk to you
about it next time around.

812
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:29,042
I trained to be a
priest for seven years.

813
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:30,375
Then I left it.

814
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:33,083
So, you are a Vehicle Inspector
in Tamil Nadu government.

815
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:36,417
Yes, and I am looking for
a girl settled in Chennai.

816
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,667
I have very close affinity
with that department.

817
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:39,792
Really?

818
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,542
They often send me my photos.

819
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:42,625
For overspeeding!

820
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:44,208
-Oh, I see!
-Sir?

821
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:46,167
-Do you have the driving license?
-What?

822
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,917
Do you have lime soda?
What do you want?

823
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:49,375
I just had a cup of tea.

824
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:50,292
That's all.

825
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:53,625
What was I saying?

826
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:55,417
So, do you have a driving license?

827
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:56,625
What?

828
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:58,083
Do you possess a two-wheeler or a car?

829
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,125
I have a two-wheeler.

830
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,750
What's its registration number?

831
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:05,750
I can get the details
about it in my phone.

832
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:15,042
You have got eight tickets
for overspeeding.

833
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:16,292
Yeah.

834
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,083
A penalty of 3,200 rupees.

835
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,292
It's not a big deal, right?

836
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:22,500
Who gave you that wrong notion?

837
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:30,167
If I give you the money now, can
you pay it in your office?

838
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,625
That's great! I was about
to suggest the same.

839
00:47:32,792 --> 00:47:34,708
I think you are a good mind reader.

840
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,292
There's a good
understanding between us.

841
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:37,833
We should work this out.

842
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:41,208
I don't have cash right now.

843
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,333
Shall I withdraw the same
from an ATM nearby?

844
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:44,292
That's fine.

845
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,708
I will help you with the change
of 3,200 rupees.

846
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:48,292
Please have your drink.

847
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,208
I will be back in no time.

848
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,208
I like her.

849
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:56,500
I don't like this.

850
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,083
This is salty.

851
00:48:00,583 --> 00:48:02,792
His name doesn't fit
his body at all.

852
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:04,792
Where did the dog bite you?

853
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,250
Here.

854
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:10,875
-Then...
-That's all right!

855
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,417
Have you taken the injections?

856
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,333
I have taken two already,
but there are more to go.

857
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,500
The injection is valid for a year.

858
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:18,500
So, if it bites again, you
may wash it off with a soap.

859
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,708
Looking at everything,
I have understood that...

860
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:24,458
the main issue is...

861
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:25,875
your loneliness.

862
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,292
Have you seen a rogue elephant?

863
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,833
Yes.

864
00:48:30,917 --> 00:48:32,708
Everyone is really scared of him.

865
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:34,708
He just walks around the
bushes like an emperor.

866
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:36,000
Then he gets old.

867
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,792
He automatically becomes humble.

868
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:40,667
He then comes down to our land
and starts to flaunt his skills.

869
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:43,458
The forest personnel injects the
tranquilizer and sedate him.

870
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:45,292
He will be then auctioned and sold.

871
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:48,750
People will use him in
festivals or occasions.

872
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:52,083
So, it's futile whether you
have an award or not.

873
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:53,458
You should learn to live in a community.

874
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,917
I don't like a gathering in general.

875
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Why is that so?

876
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:00,625
But I am reluctant to go for a wedding.

877
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,792
I can sense that issue already.

878
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:03,958
Where's the notebook?

879
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,750
Looks like, you have neatly wrapped it
in brown paper with a name slip.

880
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:06,708
Good boy!

881
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:08,083
This is our task book.

882
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:09,417
You should always have it with you.

883
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,458
As and when you complete a task...

884
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:14,458
divide the page into two.

885
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,583
What was our first task?

886
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:21,208
How were you feeling
before you bought the dog?

887
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,458
-My life was peaceful.
-Yeah.

888
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:24,833
You should note that
down on the left side.

889
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:26,042
"My life was peaceful."

890
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:28,250
You should note down the situation
afterward, on the right side.

891
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,333
"The dog bit me twice."

892
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:30,833
You should complete this
before you come here.

893
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:33,083
Otherwise, I will punish you by
making you run on the treadmill.

894
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,583
You're a egoistic person, right?

895
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:38,792
Yeah.

896
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,750
That is completely useless.
You should reduce it.

897
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,792
If someone can reduce their weight,
shedding ego is no big deal.

898
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,917
Now, let's move to task number two.

899
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,042
You had slapped a small kid and
plucked his tooth out, right?

900
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,083
You should apologize to him.

901
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,292
Be sure about it.

902
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:55,000
Apologizing will help you reduce your ego.

903
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,833
Hold this!

904
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:04,833
Hold this!

905
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Say it now.

906
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:28,583
If you use such foul
language again,

907
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,083
I will break your bones.

908
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,292
Please save this as well.

909
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,125
Yeah, this fits your taste.

910
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:43,000
Doesn't your mother have an
opinion on your marriage?

911
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,917
No, this isn't her department.

912
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,333
Yeah, a mother shouldn't interfere.

913
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:52,250
I am going to miss you
after your wedding.

914
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,708
You are unique!

915
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:58,500
What are you up to?

916
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:01,333
We have kept a deadline.

917
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,542
We will make a rank list
of the possible alliances.

918
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:04,542
And then marry the topper.

919
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:06,667
So, we will get a verdict soon.

920
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,750
-Jaffer, are you married?
-Yeah.

921
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:10,083
I actually eloped with her.

922
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,333
Oh, very nice.

923
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:13,125
Vincy, didn't you have
a love marriage?

924
00:51:14,292 --> 00:51:16,875
You are best suited to
arrange marriage for others.

925
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:19,625
Pick this.

926
00:51:19,917 --> 00:51:20,917
Oh, that's nice.

927
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:30,542
Didn't you like anyone so far?

928
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:33,000
That's okay.
We can consult a doctor.

929
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:37,542
A few days back, I stopped
eating chocolate altogether.

930
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:38,500
Do you remember that?

931
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:40,417
Yeah, that was to reduce your weight.

932
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,333
It wasn't to reduce weight.

933
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,708
There's a back story.

934
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,375
Reveal the flashback to us.

935
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:49,458
<i>I found a profile of</i>
<i>a very interesting guy.</i>

936
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:50,375
<i>And?</i>

937
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:52,000
<i>The interesting thing</i>
<i>about him is...</i>

938
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:54,792
<i>he did his Masters</i>
<i>in Chocolate Production.</i>

939
00:51:55,292 --> 00:51:56,292
<i>Chocolate?</i>

940
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:57,583
That's really interesting.

941
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,417
Chocolate is your weakness, right?

942
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:02,000
We used to call each other a bit.

943
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:05,458
Every time, he messaged me, I got excited.

944
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:08,000
I never knew about this.

945
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,375
I share all our details with you, right?

946
00:52:11,917 --> 00:52:13,292
That hardly lasted for two weeks.

947
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,542
-Then, we broke up.
-What?

948
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:15,625
What happened?

949
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,083
The thing is...

950
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:20,333
<i>We had decided to meet each other.</i>

951
00:52:20,417 --> 00:52:21,250
Okay.

952
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:22,625
<i>He informed his family about me.</i>

953
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,042
<i>They knew about my mother as well.</i>

954
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,833
<i>His mom wanted to see how I look.</i>

955
00:52:28,042 --> 00:52:29,500
<i>So, I sent him a picture.</i>

956
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:31,333
<i>That's nice.</i>
<i>So, his mom liked you as well.</i>

957
00:52:32,042 --> 00:52:33,000
What happened?

958
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:34,708
<i>His mom said...</i>

959
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,875
<i>my face is very deceptive.</i>

960
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,000
MY MOTHER SAID THAT YOU HAVE
A DECEPTIVE FACE.

961
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:39,625
<i>That hurt my ego.</i>
<i>So, I blocked him.</i>

962
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:42,375
He might have meant it as a joke.

963
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:43,708
I couldn't proceed further.

964
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:46,500
I couldn't eat chocolate for a while.

965
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,167
It took me a week to get
back to my normal life.

966
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,083
Oh, God!

967
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,625
-Do you have chocolates?
-Forget about the chocolates.

968
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:53,625
This person is a potential alliance.

969
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,542
If you have his phone
number, send him a message.

970
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:57,208
Yeah, please do that.

971
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:58,625
I have his number.

972
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:00,667
-But I don't want to do it.
-Why?

973
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,917
My pride doesn't let me do it.

974
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,292
What are you doing?

975
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:08,375
Wait and see.

976
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,417
How are you otherwise?

977
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:18,083
I am good.

978
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,958
-Where's my phone?
-Oh, no!

979
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:22,375
Hey!

980
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,333
Give me my phone.

981
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:30,292
I hope you didn't send a
message to "Chocolate".

982
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,417
I did.

983
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:32,875
Oh, no!

984
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:34,375
It should be fine.

985
00:53:34,792 --> 00:53:35,750
What did you send?

986
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:37,667
I didn't get any other topic.

987
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,167
So, I greeted him for <i>Krishna Jayanti</i>.

988
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,083
What?

989
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,250
Are you high?

990
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:44,833
Here comes the reply.

991
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,917
What is he saying?

992
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,917
-That's good.
-Thank God, it's safe.

993
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:55,000
Jos has been
complaining about you.

994
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:56,667
Did you mistakenly pluck
his wrong tooth?

995
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,792
It wasn't my mistake.
I plucked it on purpose.

996
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,958
I have been waiting to
do that for a while now.

997
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,792
How's the house
renovation going on?

998
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:06,250
The less you talk about it,
the better it is.

999
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:09,875
The workers stayed at my house
for 37 days and renovated it.

1000
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:13,625
My husband is apparently
missing them a lot now.

1001
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:16,167
Now we should arrange
Aby's marriage soon.

1002
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,458
Weren't you trying to do that?

1003
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:18,542
Yeah.

1004
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,625
A few of them were good to
go in the matrimonial site.

1005
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,083
He had to then leave for Europe.

1006
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,458
Before he goes again, we
should find someone.

1007
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:26,625
There's a very pretty girl in
our clinic, who has done MDS.

1008
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,583
Really?

1009
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:29,792
Yeah, her name is Amrita Kurian
and she's a Christian.

1010
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:32,000
Let me to try to pluck this tooth out.

1011
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:33,167
It might be worth it.

1012
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,250
Let's see.

1013
00:54:34,875 --> 00:54:35,958
What do you like to have, ma'am?

1014
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:38,417
Was his hair like this since birth?

1015
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,417
I recently got my hair colored.

1016
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:42,208
Okay.

1017
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:44,375
What do you like to have?
Shall we eat something?

1018
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:45,667
I will just have a cup of tea.

1019
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,917
-A cup of tea.
-A cup of tea.

1020
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,167
One cup of <i>Horlicks</i>
and a <i>dosa</i>.

1021
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:54,292
How about a pretty girl with MDS
degree for you, just like your mom?

1022
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,458
You should be tired now.
Have some water.

1023
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,125
She's very pretty.

1024
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,208
Do you remember a girl I liked before?

1025
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,292
-Which one?
-The one in Chennai.

1026
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,333
The girl with a single mother.

1027
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:05,958
She was a good girl.

1028
00:55:06,042 --> 00:55:07,542
But, didn't she block you?

1029
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,625
Last week, she unblocked me.

1030
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,833
Now, she's available.

1031
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,250
Great! I like her.

1032
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,917
I like her as well.
She is very cute.

1033
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,792
The house is renovated
for a reason now.

1034
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:28,958
<i>Dosa</i>.

1035
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:31,667
Brother.

1036
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:35,042
Sir, here's your order.

1037
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:36,333
One second!

1038
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,417
Brother, didn't I order the same?
Please parcel this.

1039
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,917
He's the one who is
in charge of parcels.

1040
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,542
Sir, he has been on
phone for a while now.

1041
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:43,458
-Do your work.
-I will do this myself.

1042
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:44,458
Give the parcels!

1043
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:45,833
Use your phone later.

1044
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,875
Please give me the chutney.

1045
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,083
Sorry, are you a Malayali?

1046
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:52,125
Yeah.

1047
00:55:52,292 --> 00:55:53,875
Don't misunderstand me.
I am a little busy now.

1048
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,500
Doesn't it have a proper packing?

1049
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,250
What are you doing man?

1050
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:01,208
Why are you here?
Are you dining out?

1051
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:02,708
No, I am here to get married.

1052
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:05,667
See you.

1053
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:09,583
Do you have diabetes?

1054
00:56:10,042 --> 00:56:10,917
What?

1055
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,875
Does anyone in your
family has diabetes?

1056
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,667
I will have to stop my
business if I get that.

1057
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,917
Actually it doesn't matter.

1058
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,250
Shall I call my mom?

1059
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:21,875
She wants to talk to you.

1060
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:23,625
Give me a minute.

1061
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:28,583
Brother.

1062
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,000
Shall I keep it here for two minutes?

1063
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:31,000
Please don't eat it.

1064
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,417
Mom.

1065
00:56:37,542 --> 00:56:38,583
How's it going?

1066
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:40,083
Yeah, you can talk to her.

1067
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:43,042
Hi, dear.
How're you?

1068
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:44,458
I'm good. How about you?

1069
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:47,125
<i>I am fine.</i>
<i>Were you discussing about me?</i>

1070
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,250
Yes, a few good things.

1071
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:51,375
Your smile is really infectious.

1072
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:55,292
Since I am a dentist, I can
actually figure that out fast.

1073
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:58,167
Listen...

1074
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,917
let me clarify something to you.

1075
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,708
<i>He lacks common sense.</i>

1076
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,458
<i>He shouldn't have told you what</i>
<i>I told to him.</i>

1077
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:05,667
That's okay, aunty.

1078
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:07,458
-He is young.
-Smart girl!

1079
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:10,417
I already like this proposal.
Rest is up to you guys.

1080
00:57:16,042 --> 00:57:17,375
I knew you would exaggerate.

1081
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,542
Okay.

1082
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:19,625
-I'll hang up.
-<i>Wait a second.</i>

1083
00:57:20,042 --> 00:57:21,708
Her face is really deceptive.

1084
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,083
You have to handle better.

1085
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:27,792
See you.

1086
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:35,083
By the way, mom is correct.

1087
00:57:35,542 --> 00:57:37,083
What? About the deceptive face?

1088
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:39,375
No, you have a beautiful smile.

1089
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:47,000
Yes, it is 162 centimeter.
I told you.

1090
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:50,167
I will help you.

1091
00:57:50,708 --> 00:57:51,792
She's my friend's daughter.

1092
00:57:52,083 --> 00:57:52,958
Are you her mother?

1093
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,583
No, she's my student.

1094
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:03,833
-Are you getting married?
-No.

1095
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:06,917
When you get slim and pretty, a lot
of guys would want to marry you.

1096
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:10,625
He likes me as I am.

1097
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:11,875
So, why do you need
to lose weight?

1098
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:13,958
It's to wear a special dress.

1099
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:15,750
She has designed a dress.

1100
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,667
She needs to get a
little slimmer for that.

1101
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,667
Oh, I see.

1102
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,042
I don't wish to reduce
a lot of weight.

1103
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:22,208
I will lose my beauty.

1104
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:39,500
-We shall meet often.
-Sure.

1105
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:42,958
-The teacher is really pretty.
-Yeah.

1106
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:01,542
Doctor has gone out.

1107
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:16,000
Sir, why are you here?

1108
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:17,208
I am here to...

1109
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:18,750
reduce weight.

1110
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:34,208
I forgot to take my phone.

1111
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,500
Okay.

1112
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:41,958
Oh, God!

1113
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,083
Major.

1114
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:51,625
-Do you know why I have this mustache?
-No.

1115
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,000
It's for boosting my confidence.

1116
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:55,167
To be honest, I am a huge
panic stricken person.

1117
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,542
If someone stares at me,
I will cry out of fear.

1118
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:01,000
But this mustache gives me the courage.

1119
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:05,250
Basically, we should
identify our weakness.

1120
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,292
Then we should probably ponder a bit.

1121
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:08,458
We may find a solution.

1122
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:10,083
Give me that notebook.

1123
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,333
Tell me.

1124
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:15,000
What's your weakness?

1125
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:17,625
My weakness...

1126
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:19,750
ladies...

1127
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,083
You have a weakness for ladies!

1128
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,250
No, I didn't mean that.

1129
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:23,583
Then?

1130
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:25,625
I...

1131
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,958
I don't get a topic
when I talk to them.

1132
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:30,417
Are you scared?

1133
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:32,250
I am not scared.

1134
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,708
I don't have anything to talk to them.

1135
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,917
My mother was a mute.

1136
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:42,458
She was silent.

1137
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:49,083
My father had abandoned
us long back.

1138
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:28,750
Sir, I am coming.

1139
01:01:28,875 --> 01:01:31,167
Come, sir.
You got late today.

1140
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:33,917
The dog has been barking
for a while now.

1141
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:36,208
It might be really hungry.

1142
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,500
Or maybe it got scared of something.

1143
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:39,833
Haven't you eaten anything?

1144
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,250
Come with me, sir.

1145
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:26,958
You should...

1146
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:30,083
Yeah.

1147
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:38,083
Let's discuss about ladies now.

1148
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:40,125
Why didn't you get married?

1149
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:42,750
-I didn't find it necessary.
-Why?

1150
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:44,708
Tell me.

1151
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:46,708
Have you killed anyone?

1152
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:47,833
What?

1153
01:02:48,167 --> 01:02:50,333
-Have you killed someone?
-No.

1154
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,500
Once I killed a rooster
back at my home in Kerala.

1155
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,542
-I have killed humans.
-What?

1156
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:56,542
Really?

1157
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:59,500
Only God has the authority
to take away one's life.

1158
01:02:59,917 --> 01:03:02,292
But a soldier is legally
authorized to kill otherwise.

1159
01:03:08,042 --> 01:03:10,083
God doesn't need to get married.

1160
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,875
How do you know whether
God has married or not?

1161
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:18,417
She's a new entrant.

1162
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,042
Has anything interesting
happened in your life?

1163
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,208
-What?
-You're reasonably old now.

1164
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,625
I am talking about the biological
necessities in life.

1165
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:29,333
Have you written that
down in the notebook?

1166
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,333
Foolishness.

1167
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:32,542
Now tell me.

1168
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:37,000
When I was 29 years old--

1169
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:38,250
Wow! That's the best age for it.

1170
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,333
Please say.

1171
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,625
When I was 29 years old,
I went to the Everest.

1172
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:43,792
Hotel Everest?

1173
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,250
Have you conquered the Mount Everest?

1174
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,000
Goodness! Let me note this down.

1175
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,875
I can now invite you for any special
occasions in my clinic.

1176
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:54,500
It would be chilling up
there in Everest, right?

1177
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:56,042
Did you do it on its top?

1178
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,917
A month prior to it, there
was a camp in Nepal.

1179
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,875
Okay.

1180
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,250
One Chinese girl!

1181
01:04:03,542 --> 01:04:04,542
Do you remember her name?

1182
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:05,875
I know her name.
But I won't reveal it.

1183
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:07,958
It doesn't matter nevertheless.
I won't understand.

1184
01:04:08,042 --> 01:04:09,125
Did she get pregnant?

1185
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:14,208
We had a love affair for three weeks.

1186
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:16,708
She didn't know English.

1187
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:18,542
And I didn't know Chinese.

1188
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,500
But we had a great time.

1189
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:21,542
Wow.

1190
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:25,542
After a month, she learnt English.

1191
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,958
And I learnt Chinese.

1192
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:28,625
And we broke up.

1193
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:31,750
Anyone after that?

1194
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:34,000
No.

1195
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:36,833
Didn't you have any
infatuation towards anyone later?

1196
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:38,208
No.

1197
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,417
How about before her?

1198
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:45,917
I had a crush during
my college days.

1199
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:47,625
Probably any classmate or teacher, right?

1200
01:04:49,167 --> 01:04:50,083
Shobana?

1201
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:57,500
I fell in love with her,
during her early films.

1202
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:01,208
You're blushing.

1203
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,458
Major, have you noticed the teacher?

1204
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:07,667
Doesn't she look like Shobana?

1205
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,667
Elizabeth was suggesting
the same this morning.

1206
01:05:10,042 --> 01:05:11,917
Shall I call her?
Teacher.

1207
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:13,625
Please come here.

1208
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:14,792
Okay.

1209
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,500
Sir, have you lost your weight?

1210
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:24,083
I am trying my best. It will reduce.
Right?

1211
01:05:25,875 --> 01:05:27,542
Sir, please let me know when
you're about to leave.

1212
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,792
We can share the taxi fare.
It costs 300 rupees.

1213
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:31,333
Our session is over.
You may leave.

1214
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:33,542
Let me inform them.

1215
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:35,750
What do you mean?

1216
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:37,000
I am going somewhere else.

1217
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,708
This is part of the treatment.
You will get 150 rupees.

1218
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:41,875
And Shobana is coming along with you.

1219
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:46,833
<i>Teacher, how about your husband?</i>

1220
01:05:47,542 --> 01:05:48,875
<i>Oh, you are divorced.</i>

1221
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:52,625
I was in the army.

1222
01:05:54,792 --> 01:05:56,625
<i>Madras is really hot.</i>

1223
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:58,750
<i>Dal fritter!</i>

1224
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,083
Do you like <i>dal fritter</i>?

1225
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:02,625
Sir, were you saying something?

1226
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:04,583
Nothing.

1227
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:06,792
Please play the song.

1228
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:07,917
Increase the volume.

1229
01:06:16,583 --> 01:06:17,792
Check out its smell.

1230
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,958
It's Mexican mint.

1231
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:23,708
Ma'am, look at that.

1232
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:26,583
Both of them are
coming in the same car.

1233
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:27,833
Oh, I see.

1234
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,917
<i>Love is like a chocolate</i>

1235
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:55,292
<i>Love is like a chocolate</i>

1236
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:15,208
<i>My dear, voice your mind valiantly</i>

1237
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:17,458
<i>Don't be the hesitant one, Unnikrishnan</i>

1238
01:07:17,542 --> 01:07:19,625
<i>Stealing minds and things around</i>

1239
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:21,875
<i>Don't be the innocent one</i>

1240
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:24,333
<i>No need of wearing your masks now</i>

1241
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:26,625
<i>No more of your tricks around</i>

1242
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:28,542
<i>Naive is your native expression</i>

1243
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,833
<i>Don't be the blameless one</i>

1244
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:35,750
<i>Love is like a chocolate</i>

1245
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,875
<i>Love is not a crime</i>

1246
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:48,333
<i>Love is a little dangerous</i>

1247
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,750
<i>One step forward, no steps backward</i>

1248
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:57,417
<i>Make your move, marked</i>
<i>With love and precision</i>

1249
01:07:57,542 --> 01:08:01,417
<i>My precious heart is reserved,</i>
<i>Carefully concealed otherwise</i>

1250
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,875
<i>If your love meets mine,</i>
<i>Engraved our tales be, so romantic</i>

1251
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:08,250
<i>I have nowhere to go,</i>
<i>And everywhere to run</i>

1252
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:10,458
<i>You're the reason,</i>
<i>I am clueless now</i>

1253
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:12,708
<i>When your eyes meet mine,</i>
<i>My heart aches deep</i>

1254
01:08:12,792 --> 01:08:14,833
<i>Certain is my testimony,</i>
<i>You are mine</i>

1255
01:08:14,917 --> 01:08:17,167
<i>There's no rivalry,</i>
<i>My love is real</i>

1256
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:19,375
<i>To the eyes so artistic,</i>
<i>I have fallen for you</i>

1257
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:21,833
<i>Kissed upon my cheeks,</i>
<i>Slowly with your lips</i>

1258
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:24,333
<i>Fables are aplenty, left to be told</i>

1259
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:30,542
<i>Love is not a crime</i>

1260
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:35,000
<i>Love is a little dangerous</i>

1261
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:39,417
<i>One step forward, no steps backward</i>

1262
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,583
<i>Make your move, marked</i>
<i>With love and precision</i>

1263
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,750
<i>Fallen are the mighty, long and deep</i>

1264
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:53,792
<i>When the feminine gazes pierce</i>

1265
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,625
<i>Love is like a chocolate</i>

1266
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:58,708
<i>They have fallen in love in the past</i>

1267
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:02,792
<i>There are so many spiritual sages</i>

1268
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,167
<i>My dear, voice your mind valiantly</i>

1269
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:17,458
<i>Don't be the hesitant one, Unnikrishnan</i>

1270
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:19,542
<i>Stealing minds and things around</i>

1271
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:22,125
<i>Don't be the innocent one</i>

1272
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:24,333
<i>No more of your masks around</i>

1273
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:26,500
<i>No more of your tricks around</i>

1274
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:28,500
<i>Naive is your usual expression</i>

1275
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:30,792
<i>Don't be the blameless one</i>

1276
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,875
I found the rattrap.

1277
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,333
<i>Love is like a chocolate</i>

1278
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:36,500
There's a rat inside.

1279
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:38,042
There's a rat inside.

1280
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,583
<i>The personification of happiness</i>

1281
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:43,500
<i>The sweet nectar of love</i>

1282
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:46,292
<i>Nevertheless detach the masks</i>
<i>Triumph on truths</i>

1283
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:48,542
<i>The fight is within</i>
<i>The remaining can rest</i>

1284
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:52,250
<i>Harder the phases</i>
<i>Clueless is the hell</i>

1285
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,208
<i>When you're in love</i>

1286
01:09:53,292 --> 01:09:55,250
<i>Run like anything</i>
<i>Beyond the barriers</i>

1287
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:57,458
<i>Wary of your actions</i>
<i>Within your love</i>

1288
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,458
<i>Love is not a crime</i>

1289
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:06,083
<i>Love is a little dangerous</i>

1290
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,542
<i>One step forward, no steps backward</i>

1291
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:15,250
<i>Make your move</i>
<i>Marked with love and precision</i>

1292
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:19,250
<i>Love is not a crime</i>

1293
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:23,875
<i>Love is a little dangerous</i>

1294
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:28,333
<i>One step forward, no steps backward</i>

1295
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:33,542
<i>Make your move</i>
<i>Marked with love and precision</i>

1296
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:38,417
Oh, no! What should I do?

1297
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,000
I wanted to
speak to you about this.

1298
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:57,333
Your idea to drop the
engagement ceremony was good.

1299
01:10:57,417 --> 01:11:01,083
It's a ceremony similar to a
wedding. It's just to announce loyalty.

1300
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:03,958
So true!

1301
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,083
You can use that money
productively instead.

1302
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:08,875
So, what are you going to
get me with that money?

1303
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,917
Any dowry?

1304
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:11,167
No dowry!

1305
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,458
You can use your savings.

1306
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,708
I have to figure
out my living as well.

1307
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:17,500
It's expensive to live in Madras.

1308
01:11:18,042 --> 01:11:19,167
Don't worry.

1309
01:11:19,417 --> 01:11:20,792
Next month, we're leaving this place.

1310
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:26,875
Aby suggested to
settle down in Kerala.

1311
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:28,792
They have an apartment in Kakkanad.

1312
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:30,875
His mom is very sensible.

1313
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:34,208
She's telling me,
we can live separately.

1314
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:35,500
That's good, right?

1315
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,500
I can't stay with you both.

1316
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:38,625
That's the surprise.

1317
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:41,625
I have already booked another
apartment over there.

1318
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:42,667
I bought it with my money.

1319
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:43,833
You can stay there!

1320
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,917
But I have classes here, Nikki.

1321
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,333
It's not a big deal!

1322
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:49,833
You can teach French as well.

1323
01:11:50,292 --> 01:11:52,625
I will buy you a car.
It will be awesome.

1324
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:54,333
We'll think about it.

1325
01:11:55,208 --> 01:11:57,083
Nevertheless, don't change your plans.

1326
01:11:57,542 --> 01:11:58,750
An apartment is an asset anyway.

1327
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,667
I will tell you about my decision.

1328
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:03,667
I can't leave Madras as of now.

1329
01:12:10,792 --> 01:12:12,292
-Mom.
-Yeah?

1330
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:15,625
What's going on between you and major?

1331
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:22,958
What?

1332
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,708
Is there anything special
between you two?

1333
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:26,458
Who told you?

1334
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:29,292
There's a rumor doing the rounds.

1335
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:30,583
Even our neighbor told me about it.

1336
01:12:31,042 --> 01:12:33,125
There's nothing like that, Nikki.

1337
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:34,708
Such jobless people!

1338
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:37,167
It doesn't matter now.

1339
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:39,667
Those gossip mongers can rot in hell!

1340
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:44,750
-Listen.
-Yeah?

1341
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:46,750
I can't deny that rumor completely.

1342
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:56,458
<i>Love is not a crime</i>

1343
01:12:58,833 --> 01:12:59,708
Hey!

1344
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:01,583
Do that carefully.
It's Nazriya.

1345
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:03,333
Nazriya, I am sorry!

1346
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:05,125
Can I use green color here?

1347
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:07,083
Yeah.

1348
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:08,292
What are you up to?

1349
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:10,542
Mexican mint.
How do you say it in Tamil?

1350
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:11,750
That's what it's called like.

1351
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:13,542
What happened?
Is anyone unwell?

1352
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:15,708
-Fever.
-Who's sick?

1353
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,375
Nikki is unwell.

1354
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:20,000
-Yesterday, she was fine.
-Jaya, please get me the small brush.

1355
01:13:20,292 --> 01:13:22,458
-I am coming.
-Okay.

1356
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:25,167
What's this?

1357
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:26,958
He is asking for his brush.

1358
01:13:30,292 --> 01:13:31,292
Here it is.

1359
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,292
-Be careful.
-Okay.

1360
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:34,667
Park the bike here and come fast.

1361
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:36,583
Listen.

1362
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,792
She is here with her son.

1363
01:13:38,917 --> 01:13:40,125
-What's the matter?
-Sir.

1364
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:42,792
He's the one who
fought with the major.

1365
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:45,208
Sir, can you please come with us?

1366
01:13:45,917 --> 01:13:47,500
We need to talk to the major.

1367
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:48,417
Okay.

1368
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,417
Don't go! He is an insensitive guy.

1369
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:53,125
Listen...

1370
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:55,250
I have never had a
conversation with him.

1371
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,792
Besides, he is
short tempered as well.

1372
01:13:57,875 --> 01:13:59,000
-I have blood pressure issues.
-Please, sir.

1373
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:00,458
Wait, look at that guy.

1374
01:14:00,542 --> 01:14:01,625
You may request him to come along.

1375
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:03,583
He is the right person.

1376
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:06,375
-Please take this.
-Okay.

1377
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:07,958
-Iron the uniform first.
-Okay.

1378
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:09,083
Here's a gift for you.

1379
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:13,583
Can you please go with him?

1380
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:16,833
He needs to request the major to
withdraw the case filed against him.

1381
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:19,333
Major? No way.
I don't think I can help you.

1382
01:14:19,417 --> 01:14:20,458
Please help them.

1383
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:25,333
-Didn't you guys beat him at night?
-Yes.

1384
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:26,792
-Did he see your face?
-No, he didn't!

1385
01:14:26,875 --> 01:14:28,500
-Then it's not a big deal.
-But when he fell down,

1386
01:14:28,583 --> 01:14:29,583
I said a punch dialogue to humiliate him.

1387
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:32,250
He might slap you.
Are you ready for that?

1388
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:33,542
I already have a false tooth.

1389
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:35,833
-We can fix it again.
-What are you saying?

1390
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:40,208
Come.

1391
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:47,417
-We forgot to ring the bell.
-Yeah.

1392
01:14:55,583 --> 01:14:56,583
Goodness! There's a dog.

1393
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:57,750
Please save me!

1394
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:12,250
What's the matter?

1395
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,125
This is a gift for you.

1396
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,875
-Do you want a cup of tea?
-Yeah.

1397
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:27,042
Come inside.

1398
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:29,667
Close the door.

1399
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:46,542
I have kept the hot water
in the kitchen.

1400
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:14,000
Hi, dear.

1401
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:18,792
I look prettier in real
than on the phone, right?

1402
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:20,875
Flight tickets were cheap.
So, she came along.

1403
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,167
Don't be so cheap.

1404
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:24,417
Are you sick?

1405
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,208
You have a little temperature.

1406
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:29,583
-Listen, she doesn't have dental issues.
-Hey.

1407
01:16:30,042 --> 01:16:32,208
You have to learn about medicines
if you are doing MDS.

1408
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:35,375
He believes, a dentist can
only pluck the tooth out.

1409
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:36,375
Please open your mouth.

1410
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:49,917
Why does he need to push them away?
Can't he just play?

1411
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:54,458
-Sir.
-Yeah.

1412
01:16:54,542 --> 01:16:55,958
-The game is over.
-Over?

1413
01:16:58,208 --> 01:17:00,417
I have lost my touch.
It's been a while since I played.

1414
01:17:00,792 --> 01:17:01,625
What is he saying?

1415
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:04,083
I was not sure whether
you were home.

1416
01:17:04,167 --> 01:17:06,750
-How come you are here?
-You always come to my place, right?

1417
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:08,708
For a change, I came here.

1418
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:09,792
There's a lamp.

1419
01:17:11,042 --> 01:17:12,625
It would have pierced
into my ass.

1420
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:13,792
Thank you.

1421
01:17:14,042 --> 01:17:15,750
-Where's your house?
-It's in Aluva.

1422
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:17,333
-Please get ready soon.
-What's the matter?

1423
01:17:17,417 --> 01:17:19,292
There's an anniversary program.

1424
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:21,792
-I am not coming.
-You should come at any cost.

1425
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:24,042
-Do you have a dhoti?
-I don't have a dhoti.

1426
01:17:24,292 --> 01:17:25,667
Even pants will do.

1427
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:26,667
Major should come.

1428
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,708
It's also a part of the treatment.
Do you understand?

1429
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
I mean...

1430
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:32,542
Diabetes treatment.
You know, I am a diabetician.

1431
01:17:32,792 --> 01:17:33,792
Come soon.

1432
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:37,875
Where did you get this?

1433
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:39,333
I gave this as a gift to sir.

1434
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:40,292
This is nice.

1435
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,708
I need this lamp.

1436
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:43,583
You should give me this lamp.

1437
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,125
I am taking it with me.

1438
01:17:46,542 --> 01:17:48,042
Sir, let him have it.
I will bring another one.

1439
01:18:00,917 --> 01:18:01,875
How are you now?

1440
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:04,042
I am better now.

1441
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:05,750
So, the dentist's treatment worked.

1442
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:06,958
Yeah.

1443
01:18:07,708 --> 01:18:08,750
What's she up to?

1444
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:10,292
She's sleeping beside me.

1445
01:18:11,375 --> 01:18:12,875
The best "bystander".

1446
01:18:13,667 --> 01:18:16,042
Listen, I am at a vendor's place now.

1447
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:17,833
It will take me an hour.
Is that fine?

1448
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:18,792
Hey.

1449
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:21,417
All right. Take some rest.

1450
01:18:21,542 --> 01:18:22,667
-I will call you later.
-Okay.

1451
01:18:24,042 --> 01:18:25,292
Will he be late?

1452
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:27,208
He will take an hour more.

1453
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:30,167
-Do you still have the headache?
-Yeah, a little.

1454
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:31,917
Let me apply some medicine.

1455
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:37,083
Try to get some sleep.

1456
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:38,375
Okay.

1457
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:49,625
Let me introduce you all to
Major Unnikrishnan.

1458
01:18:49,917 --> 01:18:52,333
Do you know about the
highest peak in the world, Mount Everest?

1459
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:55,542
Major Unnikrishnan from Ottappalam
has conquered it all by himself.

1460
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:58,792
-Please come, sir.
-All the terrorists in Kashmir...

1461
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:00,583
You don't have an option.

1462
01:19:00,667 --> 01:19:04,750
Their knees trembled with
fear and got fractured.

1463
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,708
Major, please come.

1464
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:11,542
Please come. Greet them.

1465
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:19,333
The memento for our chief guest
is sponsored by Dr. Boss clinic.

1466
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:20,625
That's my clinic.

1467
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:22,250
Please give it.

1468
01:19:22,542 --> 01:19:23,667
Don't be scared.
He's a nice person.

1469
01:19:23,917 --> 01:19:25,542
Please give him a round of applause.

1470
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:28,667
Give it to him.

1471
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:37,583
Stop shivering.

1472
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:39,875
Hold yourself.

1473
01:19:48,417 --> 01:19:51,125
Since I am on a diet, I am
sharing the piece with you.

1474
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:56,458
Don't get tensed.

1475
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:00,125
If my mom had told me the same,
I would have been very excited.

1476
01:20:00,292 --> 01:20:01,625
You've just fallen in love.

1477
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:04,792
I would have handled this.

1478
01:20:05,708 --> 01:20:07,125
But when she caught me off guard,

1479
01:20:07,542 --> 01:20:09,208
I told her that there's
nothing between us.

1480
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:12,000
Then I thought I should
be honest with her.

1481
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:13,375
So, I told her the truth.

1482
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:15,792
Now, she's sick.

1483
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:17,250
She isn't picking my call.

1484
01:20:17,792 --> 01:20:18,875
Give it some time.

1485
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:19,792
She will understand.

1486
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:22,042
Yeah.

1487
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,833
By the way, how's the major doing?

1488
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,250
I really don't know whether
he likes me or not.

1489
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,000
Is this one-sided love?

1490
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,083
I don't know.

1491
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,417
What do you mean?

1492
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:35,417
Normally, he doesn't smile often.

1493
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:37,417
But when he sees me, he blushes.

1494
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:40,792
So, I decided to take it forward.

1495
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,583
So, the love is mutual.

1496
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:45,417
Let's celebrate. Have the cake.

1497
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:50,083
Jump.

1498
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:52,417
How obedient he is!

1499
01:20:58,583 --> 01:21:00,375
Aunty, don't be scared.
It's KFC.

1500
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:02,250
Your mom will take care of you now.

1501
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:03,792
Thanks for dropping by.

1502
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:06,625
I've made <i>upma</i> for her.
She isn't eating though.

1503
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,125
I couldn't reach you on phone.

1504
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:10,917
So, I requested her to drop by.

1505
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:12,875
I spoke to Dr. Praveen.

1506
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,750
Since you have sore throat, he asked me
to give you antibiotics.

1507
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:18,083
-I've bought the medicines.
-I already had it in the morning.

1508
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,250
Did you call the doctor?

1509
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:22,042
Aby and his mom had
come in the morning.

1510
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:23,333
They bought the medicines.

1511
01:21:23,583 --> 01:21:25,333
They stayed with me for a while.

1512
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,042
Now I'm fine.

1513
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:31,250
Karthik just got back from school.
So, I got him along.

1514
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:33,000
Thank you so much.

1515
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:34,375
Have your food.

1516
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:36,542
Aunty prepared it for you.
I don't want it.

1517
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:38,042
Have the food!

1518
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,417
How dare you reject the food?

1519
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:43,083
Go to your home.

1520
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:44,875
Why are you feeding
<i>upma</i> to the hen?

1521
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:46,875
Have the food.

1522
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:50,667
Don't act smart.

1523
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,333
Behave yourself.

1524
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:04,667
Aby, are you traveling in Chennai
metro for the first time?

1525
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:05,625
Yes.

1526
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,417
Nikki didn't allow me to
book a cab to the airport.

1527
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:10,250
According to her, it's a luxury.

1528
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:11,625
Such a miser she is!

1529
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:14,667
Listen, we have reached our station.

1530
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:15,833
-See you.
-See you tomorrow.

1531
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:17,000
-Take care.
-Take care.

1532
01:22:20,417 --> 01:22:21,333
Okay.

1533
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,958
Speak to him only if you
are very sure about it.

1534
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:30,000
Okay.

1535
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:32,625
I will reach in the morning.

1536
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:52,583
You said you've not had
your first kiss, right?

1537
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:53,833
What?

1538
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:55,875
I think, this is a special moment.

1539
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,792
The cameras are facing the other side.

1540
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:01,792
So, it's safe.

1541
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:09,625
Aby, my mom might
get married again.

1542
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,417
Nikki, where's your dad now?

1543
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:19,500
He's settled in Canada now.

1544
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:20,750
He has got a wife and family there.

1545
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,375
Do you meet him?

1546
01:23:23,042 --> 01:23:24,208
It's a closed chapter.

1547
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:26,000
I haven't even missed him in my life.

1548
01:23:26,417 --> 01:23:27,417
My mom is a very efficient person.

1549
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,792
I don't bother about him.

1550
01:23:29,375 --> 01:23:30,833
She was always there for me.

1551
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:32,083
She's a strong character.

1552
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:34,583
But she's a little romantic.

1553
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:36,583
I got it.

1554
01:24:32,042 --> 01:24:36,042
<i>May you make your way,</i>
<i>My lord with six faces</i>

1555
01:24:36,792 --> 01:24:40,958
<i>As beautiful as the buds may become,</i>
<i>The nephew of Lord Vishnu</i>

1556
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:46,667
<i>I sing the song of my soul,</i>
<i>The yearning of your mother's heart</i>

1557
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:50,792
<i>Bless me in abundance,</i>
<i>Oh my benevolent Muruga</i>

1558
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:53,208
Get ready quickly.

1559
01:24:53,417 --> 01:24:54,417
Ma'am will come searching for us.

1560
01:24:54,958 --> 01:24:56,833
The celebrations have already begun.

1561
01:24:57,042 --> 01:24:57,875
Let's go.

1562
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:00,833
Did it come off?

1563
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,625
Yeah, fraud did it.

1564
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:04,792
You shouldn't call him fraud.

1565
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:07,000
-He's your brother.
-Yeah.

1566
01:25:07,083 --> 01:25:08,458
Yeah, but he's my fraud brother.

1567
01:25:08,792 --> 01:25:11,333
By the way, I want
to meet major's dog.

1568
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:14,125
You are good to go now.

1569
01:25:15,417 --> 01:25:17,250
Go take a shower.

1570
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:18,833
I spoke to Aby.

1571
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:20,542
What did you say?

1572
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:23,042
My mom might get married before me.

1573
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:24,292
What?

1574
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:28,333
Everyone's waiting for you.

1575
01:25:28,417 --> 01:25:29,750
It's time. Please come and sing.

1576
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,333
Go ahead.

1577
01:25:31,542 --> 01:25:32,500
You should be happy.

1578
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:35,167
Come, Neena. It's time.

1579
01:25:35,792 --> 01:25:36,750
Come, let's go.

1580
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,417
What are you blabbering?

1581
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,917
Do you need special invitation?
Come.

1582
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:07,833
<i>Ornamented with love,</i>
<i>Embellished in my wish</i>

1583
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:10,292
<i>You are the beauty, my Lord</i>
<i>I define my happiness on</i>

1584
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:12,708
<i>Waited with bated breaths,</i>
<i>your beloved mother</i>

1585
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,792
<i>To see you once, with lasting hopes</i>

1586
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:17,667
<i>Embellished in my wish</i>

1587
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:19,875
<i>You are the beauty, my Lord</i>
<i>I define my happiness on</i>

1588
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:22,750
<i>Waited with bated breaths,</i>
<i>Your beloved mother</i>

1589
01:26:22,833 --> 01:26:24,833
<i>To see you once, with lasting hopes</i>

1590
01:26:24,917 --> 01:26:27,083
<i>When you present before me,</i>
<i>Elegant and poised</i>

1591
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:31,417
<i>That's all I need, to dance</i>
<i>Like a golden peacock</i>

1592
01:26:31,792 --> 01:26:33,583
<i>Far away from eyes, long and deep</i>

1593
01:26:33,667 --> 01:26:35,750
<i>Hide behind the drapes,</i>
<i>Glee and playful</i>

1594
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:39,083
<i>The flames may flinch inside,</i>
<i>Deep into my mind</i>

1595
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:41,583
<i>My dear Lord Muruga</i>

1596
01:26:42,417 --> 01:26:47,083
<i>May you make your way,</i>
<i>My lord with six faces</i>

1597
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:57,708
<i>May you make your way,</i>
<i>My lord with six faces</i>

1598
01:26:58,833 --> 01:27:04,833
<i>As beautiful as the buds may become,</i>
<i>The nephew of Lord Vishnu</i>

1599
01:27:25,292 --> 01:27:26,167
Here comes the fraud.

1600
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:28,583
I got late.

1601
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:31,167
I had to change the sponge inside
the helmet.

1602
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,833
That's okay. Let's go inside.
Give me the tickets.

1603
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:35,833
Didn't you buy?

1604
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:39,750
Yeah, I said.

1605
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,792
Give me a second. I forgot to book them.
I will buy now.

1606
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,292
Yeah I understand. I should
pay for the tickets, right?

1607
01:27:57,667 --> 01:27:58,625
How is the situation?

1608
01:27:58,792 --> 01:28:00,042
I don't think your plan will work out.

1609
01:28:00,167 --> 01:28:01,333
She really wants to go to the USA.

1610
01:28:01,417 --> 01:28:02,833
-She even bought winter clothes.
-What?

1611
01:28:03,708 --> 01:28:06,917
Just because boyfriend declines the offer,
girlfriend doesn't need to do the same.

1612
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,292
It's illogical.

1613
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:09,625
So, I didn't have a say in it.

1614
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:11,792
How about stealing her
passport and destroying it?

1615
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:13,292
-Bad idea.
-Take this.

1616
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:15,042
My son will be back soon.
I shall leave.

1617
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:16,458
-Now, it's up to both of you.
-Listen. Stay.

1618
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,375
Don't leave.

1619
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:36,250
Oh, my God.

1620
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:38,792
Be a little practical.

1621
01:28:55,292 --> 01:28:56,333
Wafa, this...

1622
01:28:57,042 --> 01:28:58,250
Oh God, that kid will come now.

1623
01:29:12,375 --> 01:29:14,875
Spare me just two minutes.
I shall show you the products.

1624
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:16,417
I have all the useful products with me.

1625
01:29:16,542 --> 01:29:18,250
There are kitchen products, cleaning
products, bathroom products.

1626
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:20,708
Shall I brief them to you.
I won't take much of your time.

1627
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:21,667
I don't need them.

1628
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:23,708
Sir, can you please call your wife?

1629
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:24,958
She might find this useful.

1630
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:28,792
Ma'am, this is an air tight pet jar.

1631
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,333
You may preserve many spices in it.

1632
01:29:34,167 --> 01:29:35,833
It's a four in one pack.

1633
01:29:37,667 --> 01:29:40,750
It's a ceramic bowl and you may
keep liquid in it.

1634
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:42,500
It will leave no stains.

1635
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:48,125
But this... ma'am, please see this.

1636
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:50,000
He is Karthik. He lives downstairs.

1637
01:29:52,833 --> 01:29:53,833
Talk to him about the dog.

1638
01:29:54,375 --> 01:29:55,917
He wants to meet Jimmy.

1639
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:57,458
Who's Jimmy?

1640
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:58,875
Sir, your dog.

1641
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:02,542
You can meet him anytime.

1642
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:03,833
Let's go now.

1643
01:30:08,042 --> 01:30:10,083
Ma'am, take a look at
the stainless steel.

1644
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:11,125
Let's go.

1645
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:19,000
Please buy something.

1646
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:32,750
Come, let's go.

1647
01:30:37,208 --> 01:30:38,375
I will buy this.

1648
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:39,292
Thanks a lot, ma'am.

1649
01:30:44,042 --> 01:30:45,292
That's his name, right?

1650
01:30:45,417 --> 01:30:46,292
Oh, I lost it.

1651
01:30:46,958 --> 01:30:48,208
Don't lose it.

1652
01:30:48,708 --> 01:30:49,750
The dog won't respond without it.

1653
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,792
Actually, this is unnecessary.

1654
01:30:52,208 --> 01:30:56,333
If they like us, they
will respond to any name.

1655
01:31:06,708 --> 01:31:08,292
See, it's coming towards you.

1656
01:31:18,917 --> 01:31:20,417
I am prepared now.

1657
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:22,250
She will break up with me.

1658
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:24,250
Yeah, he's already flirting with her.

1659
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:25,708
Moron.

1660
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:47,417
What the hell!

1661
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,500
It's the same table.

1662
01:32:00,292 --> 01:32:01,167
What?

1663
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:03,917
I had met Aby at the same
table for the first time.

1664
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:06,167
When I got here, only
this table was free.

1665
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,083
Okay.

1666
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:08,292
Where's Aby?

1667
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:11,542
No, he has gone to Europe for a month.

1668
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:20,250
If I had a daughter of your age,

1669
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:22,792
it would have been easier
for me to communicate.

1670
01:32:29,625 --> 01:32:30,958
We have to call this wedding off.

1671
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:37,958
Ma'am, what would you like to have?

1672
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:41,458
I will have a coffee.

1673
01:32:41,583 --> 01:32:43,250
-She would like a <i>Horlicks</i>, right?
-Yeah.

1674
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:44,417
<i>Horlicks</i> for her.

1675
01:32:52,792 --> 01:32:54,458
Aby's dad might not have liked
the proposal, right?

1676
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:04,208
I really like you a lot.

1677
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:06,125
I will miss you badly.

1678
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:11,042
I thought...

1679
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:15,417
my son was like me.

1680
01:33:17,708 --> 01:33:18,667
But he is not.

1681
01:33:20,292 --> 01:33:21,500
He is like his dad.

1682
01:33:23,583 --> 01:33:25,125
It's better that you don't
become a part of my family.

1683
01:33:25,792 --> 01:33:27,792
If you do, you will never be happy.

1684
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:34,708
Don't get married to Aby.

1685
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:39,292
By the way...

1686
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:41,625
he has asked to make a video call.

1687
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:43,875
That's not needed.

1688
01:33:44,542 --> 01:33:45,417
What?

1689
01:33:46,417 --> 01:33:48,583
I am not used to crying
in public places.

1690
01:33:49,167 --> 01:33:51,958
And I have to come back
to these places again.

1691
01:33:52,542 --> 01:33:53,417
Ma'am.

1692
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,625
-Ask her to have the tea.
-Nikki, listen.

1693
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:58,833
I broke my sandals.

1694
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:02,292
I need to buy a new one.
Can you come with me?

1695
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:05,667
This is fine.

1696
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:08,625
-Ma'am, it's your sandal.
-What's he saying?

1697
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,000
It's the sandal you
were wearing before.

1698
01:34:10,958 --> 01:34:12,875
-That's all right.
-My size isn't available here.

1699
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:13,833
I will buy from Cochin.

1700
01:34:14,542 --> 01:34:15,375
Let's go.

1701
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,083
Please don't tell Aby
that I cried in public.

1702
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:20,750
My reputation will be damaged.

1703
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:25,292
I may unfollow you in <i>Instagram</i>.

1704
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:27,917
That's not because I have any
hard feelings towards you.

1705
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,875
Yeah.

1706
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:32,917
I'll take your leave now.

1707
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:34,667
Even I am not used to
crying in public places.

1708
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:37,750
Let's go.

1709
01:34:39,292 --> 01:34:40,167
Bye, dear.

1710
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:01,375
What's her problem?

1711
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:04,375
She wants to break up with me.

1712
01:35:04,542 --> 01:35:05,583
Not answering.

1713
01:35:07,208 --> 01:35:08,708
Oh God, there's a scooter.
Stop!

1714
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:09,833
Damn!

1715
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:14,708
No one's around.

1716
01:35:18,167 --> 01:35:19,042
Oh, my God.

1717
01:35:22,375 --> 01:35:23,250
Thank God.

1718
01:35:23,792 --> 01:35:25,000
Anyway, it's not a big deal.

1719
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:31,417
The mirror seems to be broken.

1720
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:32,875
I have no idea about it.

1721
01:35:38,125 --> 01:35:39,000
Damn.

1722
01:35:41,625 --> 01:35:42,500
Here you go.

1723
01:35:45,542 --> 01:35:46,417
What?

1724
01:35:49,042 --> 01:35:50,708
To be honest, this is not fair.

1725
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:52,750
Have some manners.

1726
01:36:33,667 --> 01:36:34,625
What?

1727
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:37,125
Help! Someone please come and help!

1728
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:38,792
Leave my shirt.

1729
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:40,583
Leave him.

1730
01:36:40,667 --> 01:36:41,625
Don't scratch me.

1731
01:36:41,708 --> 01:36:43,250
I told you not to scratch me, fatso.

1732
01:36:43,417 --> 01:36:45,417
-Leave my beard.
-Stop fighting.

1733
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,375
I didn't kick you.

1734
01:36:46,458 --> 01:36:48,000
Oh, my God, they are killing me.

1735
01:36:48,083 --> 01:36:50,417
-Aakashavani, I meant to kick him.
-Oh, God!

1736
01:36:51,042 --> 01:36:51,875
Are you all right?

1737
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:52,875
Leave my hand.

1738
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:53,875
Nikki, please do something.

1739
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:56,208
Please slap him.

1740
01:36:56,292 --> 01:36:57,708
-Nikki, slap him.
-Slap him.

1741
01:36:57,875 --> 01:36:59,250
No, don't interfere.

1742
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:00,625
Slap him.

1743
01:37:00,833 --> 01:37:03,167
This is our family affair.
Nikki, don't interfere.

1744
01:37:06,625 --> 01:37:08,083
Very nice.

1745
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:09,167
That's awesome.

1746
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:13,458
-Superb, dear.
-Don't laugh at me.

1747
01:37:16,667 --> 01:37:19,292
Is that your bike parked outside?

1748
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,292
No, it's my friend's bike.

1749
01:37:21,792 --> 01:37:23,417
It suits your personality.

1750
01:37:23,708 --> 01:37:25,958
I have a 1970 model.

1751
01:37:26,167 --> 01:37:27,333
Let me know if you want it.

1752
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:28,792
I don't need one.

1753
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:31,375
I am actually planning
to buy a car.

1754
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,542
Sir, car is very dangerous.

1755
01:37:33,625 --> 01:37:34,708
Bike is a safe option.

1756
01:37:34,917 --> 01:37:36,583
Isn't that the other way around?

1757
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:40,583
If a truck comes from the opposite
direction, the car will bump into it.

1758
01:37:40,667 --> 01:37:41,750
That's not the same with the bike.

1759
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:43,708
It will find a way between the vehicles.

1760
01:37:50,833 --> 01:37:51,792
Is there a problem?

1761
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:52,917
I don't have a problem.

1762
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:54,875
-Then it's fine.
-No, there's a problem.

1763
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,417
-What?
-I fought with my old gang.

1764
01:37:57,708 --> 01:37:58,542
What's the issue?

1765
01:37:58,792 --> 01:38:00,417
One of those guys came
home and threatened my mom.

1766
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:03,792
He said he will kill me
before this Diwali.

1767
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:05,708
He was rude to her.

1768
01:38:06,042 --> 01:38:07,792
She got scared and is
not letting me go to Delhi.

1769
01:38:08,542 --> 01:38:09,917
Is there any business
benefits if you go now?

1770
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,042
Definitely!
It's the peak time of the year.

1771
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:12,250
Okay.

1772
01:38:12,542 --> 01:38:13,667
Don't cancel the trip.

1773
01:38:14,542 --> 01:38:16,000
I will speak to your mother.

1774
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:17,917
-Get ready to leave.
-Okay.

1775
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:19,000
Hop on.

1776
01:38:39,417 --> 01:38:40,292
Were you sleeping?

1777
01:38:40,417 --> 01:38:41,333
Okay.

1778
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:43,208
I need to take something from
the store room.

1779
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:44,667
The house owner has
given me the keys.

1780
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,167
Okay.

1781
01:38:53,792 --> 01:38:54,750
Can you hold this, please?

1782
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:58,042
Is there a carrom board here?

1783
01:38:58,125 --> 01:38:59,375
Yeah, I came to pick this up.

1784
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:00,542
Is this yours?

1785
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:04,792
Actually, what's your name?

1786
01:39:10,458 --> 01:39:11,417
You got any surname?

1787
01:39:14,417 --> 01:39:15,708
Fraud is a better name.

1788
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:21,917
Isn't Nikitha's pet name Nikki?

1789
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,500
Yeah.

1790
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,667
If you change a letter
in it, it becomes "Nakki".

1791
01:39:27,167 --> 01:39:28,083
Please move.

1792
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,500
Get lost!

1793
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,042
<i>Laden is the Holy Cross</i>

1794
01:39:52,417 --> 01:39:55,708
<i>In the shape of sin, so severe</i>

1795
01:39:56,083 --> 01:39:58,417
<i>Absorb the blame, one for all</i>

1796
01:39:59,125 --> 01:40:02,042
<i>The needy hand for the poor</i>

1797
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:05,333
<i>In the Calvary, blessed to us</i>

1798
01:40:05,417 --> 01:40:08,833
<i>Words of wisdom, ever so consecrated</i>

1799
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:10,708
<i>At the feet of my Lord</i>

1800
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,542
<i>In my pursuit for you, forever</i>

1801
01:40:14,125 --> 01:40:17,375
<i>Oh my lord Jesus</i>

1802
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:21,333
You had love affairs in tenth standard,
and even when you were in college.

1803
01:40:21,458 --> 01:40:23,292
And then married the guy you dated.

1804
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:25,500
So, the major is fifth guy
in your life, right?

1805
01:40:25,625 --> 01:40:27,000
-No, he's the sixth actually.
-What?

1806
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:28,875
I had dated two guys when
I was in college.

1807
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:31,208
I didn't know that.

1808
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:32,333
Listen.

1809
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:35,042
Are you sure about major?

1810
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:39,125
Your marriage choice did not end up well.

1811
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:43,792
Jayaram was my favorite choice as well.

1812
01:40:44,625 --> 01:40:48,250
I knew I would have
to pay a heavy price.

1813
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:50,500
Yet I decided to marry him.

1814
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,833
On our wedding day, I was really excited.

1815
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,542
So I pinched him, out of happiness.

1816
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:04,917
Ram stamped me with his boots.

1817
01:41:05,375 --> 01:41:06,583
He was then smiling at me.

1818
01:41:08,292 --> 01:41:11,167
I signed for my marriage
with that throbbing pain.

1819
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:12,792
That's where it all began.

1820
01:41:14,792 --> 01:41:18,333
After marriage, he was a
different person altogether.

1821
01:41:18,417 --> 01:41:19,500
It was very scary!

1822
01:41:20,667 --> 01:41:22,708
Education doesn't make
a difference to it.

1823
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:24,083
He was doing his PhD.

1824
01:41:24,292 --> 01:41:26,708
But if his research paper failed,

1825
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:28,250
he would vent his anger upon me.

1826
01:41:29,167 --> 01:41:30,500
If I resisted, he would hit me harder.

1827
01:41:33,333 --> 01:41:35,583
When I was eight months
pregnant with Nikki

1828
01:41:35,875 --> 01:41:36,750
he hit me for the last time.

1829
01:41:37,833 --> 01:41:39,042
I was pregnant and

1830
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:40,750
to stop him from being aggressive

1831
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:41,833
I remained silent the whole time.

1832
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:46,500
Then he hit me,
threatening me to speak up.

1833
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:49,333
That was the day I called you.

1834
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,125
I had spoken to major about this.

1835
01:41:55,042 --> 01:41:57,375
He was least bothered
about my past.

1836
01:41:58,417 --> 01:42:00,208
He was worried about
something else.

1837
01:42:00,833 --> 01:42:01,792
What was that?

1838
01:42:02,792 --> 01:42:04,042
The fact that I was crying.

1839
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:18,708
Teacher.

1840
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:20,500
Teacher, please don't cry.

1841
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:22,958
Teacher, please don't cry.

1842
01:42:23,833 --> 01:42:24,667
Teacher.

1843
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:26,333
If someone cries, I get upset as well.

1844
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:30,958
See?

1845
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,042
That's nice. Oh, my God!

1846
01:42:43,167 --> 01:42:44,292
He's really interesting.

1847
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:45,958
Father is here.

1848
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:47,750
Go ahead.

1849
01:42:48,292 --> 01:42:49,167
Is that necessary?

1850
01:42:50,167 --> 01:42:51,167
You want to confess, right?

1851
01:42:52,042 --> 01:42:54,458
To be honest, I have not sinned.

1852
01:42:54,750 --> 01:42:56,500
I have just fallen
in love with someone.

1853
01:42:56,833 --> 01:42:58,167
Let's go.

1854
01:43:00,917 --> 01:43:03,292
Father, we were just praying.

1855
01:43:03,583 --> 01:43:05,125
-Shall we leave?
-Sure.

1856
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:09,042
The major seems to be a good man.

1857
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,875
Yeah, I am coming.
Happy Diwali!

1858
01:43:20,667 --> 01:43:22,000
I will join you soon.

1859
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:25,208
We are well prepared!

1860
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,167
How are you, kids?

1861
01:43:29,833 --> 01:43:31,167
Brother, please come for dinner.

1862
01:43:31,417 --> 01:43:32,458
No brother, it's fine.

1863
01:43:32,667 --> 01:43:33,792
Yeah, I am coming.

1864
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:35,917
-When will we burst?
-Wait!

1865
01:43:39,042 --> 01:43:40,042
Mom.

1866
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,625
You are here!

1867
01:43:42,917 --> 01:43:44,333
Take a shower and visit the temple.

1868
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:48,000
-Did major gift you a new cooker?
-What?

1869
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:49,542
Didn't he come?

1870
01:43:49,667 --> 01:43:50,500
No.

1871
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:52,083
He told me that he would come home.

1872
01:43:52,208 --> 01:43:54,042
-Where did you get this new cooker?
-Oh, you mean this?

1873
01:43:54,292 --> 01:43:56,042
Do you remember the guy who made a
scene here, from your old gang?

1874
01:43:56,167 --> 01:43:58,292
He apologized to me and
gifted me a cooker.

1875
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:00,458
Someone has thrashed him badly.

1876
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:04,042
Tell me, what happened?

1877
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:06,875
The army person who we thrashed
was here.

1878
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:27,833
Look, who's back! The guy
whom we thrashed last month.

1879
01:44:27,917 --> 01:44:29,708
Bro, that was last month.

1880
01:44:29,792 --> 01:44:31,125
This is a new month.

1881
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:32,833
That's true.

1882
01:44:34,875 --> 01:44:37,125
I guess he likes to get
thrashed every month.

1883
01:44:37,292 --> 01:44:38,542
Ma'am, please keep it safe.

1884
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:42,667
Here comes the joker.

1885
01:44:45,208 --> 01:44:47,125
Do you remember me?

1886
01:45:00,792 --> 01:45:03,250
He remembers everyone vividly.

1887
01:45:03,375 --> 01:45:04,500
He didn't spare any of us.

1888
01:45:04,583 --> 01:45:06,083
He didn't even give us
time to breathe.

1889
01:45:26,792 --> 01:45:27,625
Oh, God!

1890
01:45:27,708 --> 01:45:29,458
You should apologize to his mother.

1891
01:45:29,667 --> 01:45:31,125
-Will you do it?
-I will.

1892
01:45:31,333 --> 01:45:34,042
You should buy her a new
cooker for Diwali.

1893
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:35,167
Will you do that?

1894
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:36,125
I will do it.

1895
01:45:36,292 --> 01:45:37,125
Will you forget?

1896
01:45:37,458 --> 01:45:38,333
I won't forget.

1897
01:45:38,417 --> 01:45:40,000
You will forget.

1898
01:45:44,917 --> 01:45:45,917
Don't mock me.

1899
01:45:57,542 --> 01:45:58,708
Your mom is here.

1900
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:02,625
So, is this why you
didn't pick the call?

1901
01:46:02,958 --> 01:46:03,917
The dinner is ready.

1902
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:05,750
She had <i>upma</i>.

1903
01:46:05,917 --> 01:46:06,917
Okay.

1904
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:08,042
Isn't your brother home yet?

1905
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:09,583
Fraud is working in the night shift today.

1906
01:46:09,667 --> 01:46:10,500
Okay.

1907
01:46:11,833 --> 01:46:14,333
-Not like that.
-Do you know how to play this game?

1908
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:18,583
-Wow!
-Nikki lost.

1909
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:24,250
-I am leaving.
-Okay.

1910
01:46:26,167 --> 01:46:27,542
What happened?

1911
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:29,458
-It's fine, don't worry.
-Oh, my God!

1912
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:30,875
-Get me some ice cubes.
-Okay.

1913
01:46:41,583 --> 01:46:43,125
We need to talk.

1914
01:46:44,708 --> 01:46:46,792
The striker struck Karthik on his lips.
He got hurt.

1915
01:46:51,417 --> 01:46:52,833
They are asleep now.

1916
01:46:53,208 --> 01:46:54,500
Why do you need to interfere?

1917
01:46:54,917 --> 01:46:55,833
What did you say?

1918
01:46:56,083 --> 01:46:57,375
You didn't need to interfere.

1919
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:58,917
Are you blaming me?

1920
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:00,083
That's true.

1921
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:01,292
-Yes, you are responsible.
-What?

1922
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:04,667
Neither do you speak to me
nor listen to me.

1923
01:47:05,667 --> 01:47:06,500
Listen to me.

1924
01:47:07,208 --> 01:47:08,750
We should sort this out.

1925
01:47:09,042 --> 01:47:10,458
What's left to be discussed?

1926
01:47:11,042 --> 01:47:12,208
You have spoilt my life.

1927
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:15,042
Does marriage define your life?

1928
01:47:15,667 --> 01:47:17,500
That guy couldn't accept you
for who you are.

1929
01:47:17,708 --> 01:47:20,500
It is difficult for him to accept
that you are in love.

1930
01:47:21,292 --> 01:47:22,292
Love?

1931
01:47:22,875 --> 01:47:23,875
How can you be so cheap?

1932
01:47:24,958 --> 01:47:25,833
What do you...

1933
01:47:25,917 --> 01:47:27,125
what do you know about me?

1934
01:47:27,833 --> 01:47:30,917
You can't choose your partner
based on a set of parameters.

1935
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:34,167
If you had fallen in love

1936
01:47:34,333 --> 01:47:35,542
you wouldn't judge me.

1937
01:47:38,875 --> 01:47:39,833
Can you please sit down?

1938
01:47:42,167 --> 01:47:43,000
Please sit down.

1939
01:47:52,542 --> 01:47:54,958
During my tenth grade, I used
to like a guy named Harish.

1940
01:47:56,208 --> 01:47:57,917
During my 12th grade, I liked
a guy named Jom.

1941
01:47:58,083 --> 01:47:59,083
He was very tall.

1942
01:48:00,667 --> 01:48:01,792
During my CA coaching,

1943
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:03,583
there was a teacher who looked
like Fahad Faasil.

1944
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:05,667
He liked me as well.

1945
01:48:07,167 --> 01:48:10,708
I never opened up to my
close friends.

1946
01:48:11,542 --> 01:48:13,000
I thought they might mock me.

1947
01:48:16,375 --> 01:48:17,583
My mom is romantic.

1948
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:20,708
They might judge me to be crazy as well.

1949
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:31,000
If you had talked to me then...

1950
01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:33,833
I would have explored more.

1951
01:48:36,125 --> 01:48:37,167
Now it's late.

1952
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:40,708
So technically, you can't blame me.

1953
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,250
It doesn't matter that Aby rejected me.

1954
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:44,417
I may find someone better.

1955
01:48:46,875 --> 01:48:48,542
But I am sad that I lost his mom.

1956
01:48:50,208 --> 01:48:51,875
Do you remember the day I was sick?

1957
01:48:52,292 --> 01:48:54,000
I really hoped that you
would stay back.

1958
01:48:54,625 --> 01:48:55,833
But you didn't understand.

1959
01:48:57,833 --> 01:48:59,708
Aby's mom stayed with me that day.

1960
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:01,458
And she took good care of me.

1961
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:04,167
When I was really distressed,

1962
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,750
she laid beside me,
hugging me tight.

1963
01:49:07,458 --> 01:49:10,875
I don't remember the last time
you hugged me.

1964
01:49:12,375 --> 01:49:14,000
So, I don't miss him.

1965
01:49:14,417 --> 01:49:15,417
I miss his mom.

1966
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:19,500
She was a perfect mother for me.

1967
01:49:26,292 --> 01:49:27,583
You were right.

1968
01:49:28,625 --> 01:49:30,125
I feel much better now.

1969
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:32,125
I can sleep well today.

1970
01:49:48,375 --> 01:49:53,542
<i>A tiny feather of caressing</i>

1971
01:49:54,417 --> 01:49:59,667
<i>Floats across you, my petite baby</i>

1972
01:50:00,292 --> 01:50:02,833
<i>When the night is cold and dark,</i>

1973
01:50:02,958 --> 01:50:06,375
<i>Like a quilt so warm</i>

1974
01:50:06,958 --> 01:50:11,083
<i>Held you close, in my embrace</i>

1975
01:50:12,375 --> 01:50:14,542
<i>For every single day</i>

1976
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:17,458
<i>Guarded you beloved, my angel</i>

1977
01:50:17,542 --> 01:50:20,583
<i>Nearer to you, than your shadow</i>

1978
01:50:20,667 --> 01:50:23,500
<i>Oblivious to you, in my shield</i>

1979
01:50:23,583 --> 01:50:26,500
<i>Heed them all, to the voices near</i>

1980
01:50:26,583 --> 01:50:29,208
<i>Hear them all, to the music night</i>

1981
01:50:29,458 --> 01:50:32,667
<i>Breathe the sound of your love</i>

1982
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:35,542
<i>The love, your mom</i>

1983
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:43,000
<i>In the pursuit of your mother</i>

1984
01:51:06,083 --> 01:51:07,083
Go upstairs.

1985
01:51:08,792 --> 01:51:10,083
Don't stay on the ground floor.

1986
01:51:10,167 --> 01:51:11,625
Shift to the top floor.

1987
01:51:11,708 --> 01:51:12,708
Okay, sir.

1988
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:14,375
We will be back when the
rain subsides.

1989
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:16,667
-Come soon.
-Coming, Dad.

1990
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:17,750
Be careful. It's slippery.

1991
01:51:17,833 --> 01:51:19,458
We need to shift to the top floor.

1992
01:51:19,542 --> 01:51:20,375
Goodness!

1993
01:51:20,458 --> 01:51:21,542
It's getting flooded here.

1994
01:51:21,625 --> 01:51:23,708
Hey come, let's shift
to the top floor.

1995
01:51:41,292 --> 01:51:42,208
Don't you need this?

1996
01:51:42,708 --> 01:51:43,875
It's okay. This is my house.

1997
01:51:50,208 --> 01:51:52,417
Karthik, the walls are all drenched.

1998
01:51:52,667 --> 01:51:54,333
Don't switch on the TV.
It's dangerous.

1999
01:51:54,417 --> 01:51:55,417
Okay.

2000
01:51:59,833 --> 01:52:01,083
Be careful.

2001
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:02,833
-Hey, KFC.
-Get up.

2002
01:52:02,917 --> 01:52:04,000
Get up.

2003
01:52:05,917 --> 01:52:07,917
It's raining heavily. I slipped.

2004
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,292
Are you all right?

2005
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:10,542
I am okay now.

2006
01:52:10,833 --> 01:52:13,167
-Is fraud home?
-Fraud will be late.

2007
01:52:13,792 --> 01:52:14,667
Okay, I will come now.

2008
01:52:17,333 --> 01:52:18,250
Nikki will come.

2009
01:52:29,417 --> 01:52:30,875
-Take this.
-He is here.

2010
01:52:30,958 --> 01:52:32,750
Fraud has bought bread and milk.

2011
01:52:33,833 --> 01:52:36,042
-You guys carry on.
-There's a store room there.

2012
01:52:36,292 --> 01:52:37,292
I will come behind you.

2013
01:52:43,958 --> 01:52:45,750
Major, this is your last task.

2014
01:52:47,417 --> 01:52:48,625
Should I go to the Himalayas?

2015
01:52:48,833 --> 01:52:50,417
No, you have already been there, right?

2016
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:52,208
Isn't it on the way to the Everest?

2017
01:52:52,417 --> 01:52:54,042
This is a youth wing program.

2018
01:52:54,833 --> 01:52:56,958
They are traveling to the
Himalayas on their bikes.

2019
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:00,167
You will be commencing their ride.

2020
01:53:00,417 --> 01:53:02,583
You will say a speech
without trembling.

2021
01:53:02,667 --> 01:53:03,500
Oh, no.

2022
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Give me the book.

2023
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:08,458
Let me keep this inside.

2024
01:53:12,833 --> 01:53:15,083
If you handle this well,
you will be better than ever.

2025
01:53:15,292 --> 01:53:16,917
You wouldn't need any
further treatment.

2026
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:19,625
I can do the "Flag off".

2027
01:53:19,833 --> 01:53:20,792
Can't the speech be avoided?

2028
01:53:20,875 --> 01:53:23,917
Haven't you conquered the Everest?

2029
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Don't be scared.

2030
01:53:25,292 --> 01:53:28,042
You need to share your life experiences.

2031
01:53:28,292 --> 01:53:30,750
But don't disclose the
relationship with the Chinese girl.

2032
01:53:35,458 --> 01:53:36,708
Is it flooded there?

2033
01:53:37,417 --> 01:53:38,250
Not much.

2034
01:53:38,708 --> 01:53:40,042
Only the ground floor is affected.

2035
01:53:40,792 --> 01:53:42,792
There's nothing alarming.

2036
01:53:43,042 --> 01:53:44,667
Do you have enough supplies?

2037
01:53:45,375 --> 01:53:48,542
When flood beckons, army
people are called upon first.

2038
01:53:49,208 --> 01:53:52,083
Nobody dares to ask their whereabouts.

2039
01:53:54,125 --> 01:53:55,542
After all, I am a soldier!

2040
01:54:11,125 --> 01:54:12,208
KFC, have the food.

2041
01:54:13,208 --> 01:54:14,083
Your turn.

2042
01:54:15,292 --> 01:54:16,125
Yeah.

2043
01:54:16,458 --> 01:54:17,417
Come here.

2044
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:22,208
Come with me.

2045
01:54:23,583 --> 01:54:24,833
Please give this to major.

2046
01:54:25,708 --> 01:54:26,667
This is for Jimmy.

2047
01:54:26,875 --> 01:54:29,500
He's not Jimmy anymore.
He's Prabhakaran now.

2048
01:54:30,958 --> 01:54:32,500
Okay, give this to Prabhakaran.

2049
01:54:32,958 --> 01:54:33,833
Oh, my God.

2050
01:54:34,708 --> 01:54:36,208
You may leave. I will give this.

2051
01:54:36,667 --> 01:54:37,500
Take this.

2052
01:54:40,208 --> 01:54:41,625
-Have you kept any letter?
-Come, let's play.

2053
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:44,250
Are you playing with me?
It's my turn.

2054
01:54:55,583 --> 01:54:56,417
Here's your food.

2055
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:58,125
This is for the dog.

2056
01:54:58,750 --> 01:54:59,583
Don't get confused.

2057
01:55:01,292 --> 01:55:03,417
Leave me! There's a limit to everything.

2058
01:55:03,583 --> 01:55:05,000
-Leave him.
-He needs to learn.

2059
01:55:05,083 --> 01:55:06,458
-Karthik, stop shouting.
-Push them away.

2060
01:55:06,542 --> 01:55:08,917
-I will scratch you!
-Leave his hand.

2061
01:55:09,167 --> 01:55:10,500
Does it hurt?

2062
01:55:10,583 --> 01:55:11,833
If you scratch me again,

2063
01:55:11,917 --> 01:55:13,833
I will feed your hen to major's dog.

2064
01:55:13,917 --> 01:55:15,042
Leave me!

2065
01:55:15,125 --> 01:55:16,667
Bibeesh, come with me.

2066
01:55:16,750 --> 01:55:17,708
Nikki, take him upstairs.

2067
01:55:17,792 --> 01:55:18,625
Leave me alone.

2068
01:55:18,958 --> 01:55:21,167
-Damn! It's slippery here.
-Stay silent.

2069
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:22,750
My face is full of scratches.

2070
01:55:22,833 --> 01:55:23,708
Oh, my God.

2071
01:55:23,792 --> 01:55:25,958
I am tired of both of them!

2072
01:55:28,458 --> 01:55:30,083
Aren't you ashamed
to fight with him?

2073
01:55:30,167 --> 01:55:31,458
He's just 12 years old.

2074
01:55:31,542 --> 01:55:33,125
I have to always depend
on an ointment.

2075
01:55:33,208 --> 01:55:35,375
-Don't think him to be innocent!
-Why are you always irritating him?

2076
01:55:35,458 --> 01:55:36,500
It's a fight between the brothers.

2077
01:55:36,583 --> 01:55:37,583
Please calm down.

2078
01:55:40,708 --> 01:55:41,833
Are you okay?

2079
01:55:46,333 --> 01:55:47,208
Are you okay?

2080
01:55:49,042 --> 01:55:51,500
His nails are sharper than the razor.

2081
01:55:51,792 --> 01:55:53,125
He doesn't cut it off.

2082
01:55:53,208 --> 01:55:54,750
I have got scratches all over.

2083
01:55:54,833 --> 01:55:56,500
Shall I make a
milkshake for you?

2084
01:55:58,292 --> 01:55:59,125
Okay.

2085
01:56:01,125 --> 01:56:02,000
-Give it to him.
-Have it.

2086
01:56:04,583 --> 01:56:05,917
-Have it.
-Is she pregnant?

2087
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,542
Yeah, five months pregnant.

2088
01:56:08,583 --> 01:56:10,125
We'll definitely have a girl.

2089
01:56:10,292 --> 01:56:11,625
We will name her Nayantara.

2090
01:56:12,708 --> 01:56:14,875
Boys are named after
Vijay and Ajith.

2091
01:56:15,042 --> 01:56:17,417
-Oh, I see.
-They also fight all the time.

2092
01:56:25,458 --> 01:56:27,000
How old were you when
Karthik was born?

2093
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,208
I was in eleventh class.

2094
01:56:29,792 --> 01:56:31,042
It would have been so funny.

2095
01:56:31,333 --> 01:56:32,542
Weren't you mocked then?

2096
01:56:33,042 --> 01:56:34,458
My mom was my class teacher.

2097
01:56:34,958 --> 01:56:36,292
Everyone in the class
used to tease me.

2098
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:37,708
Oh, I see.

2099
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,167
I didn't understand it then.

2100
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:44,542
My parents were behaving
really strange back home.

2101
01:56:45,042 --> 01:56:46,333
They were being super nice to me.

2102
01:56:48,625 --> 01:56:49,542
Chicken?

2103
01:56:49,625 --> 01:56:50,542
What's special today?

2104
01:56:50,625 --> 01:56:51,875
It's nothing special.

2105
01:56:52,042 --> 01:56:53,500
You may sleep with us today.

2106
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:56,958
Turn off the lights.

2107
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:01,458
Hey, your mom is pregnant.

2108
01:57:01,542 --> 01:57:02,458
What?

2109
01:57:05,875 --> 01:57:06,792
That's him.

2110
01:57:14,708 --> 01:57:17,292
The baby has your face cut.

2111
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,667
He looks like Jackie Chan.

2112
01:57:21,208 --> 01:57:22,792
Really?

2113
01:57:22,875 --> 01:57:24,042
He's much cuter than you.

2114
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:25,375
That's because he's chubby.

2115
01:57:26,792 --> 01:57:27,958
But he was our lucky charm.

2116
01:57:29,167 --> 01:57:31,250
After a year, my dad got a
promotion in LIC.

2117
01:57:32,417 --> 01:57:33,500
Mom had a lingering back pain.

2118
01:57:34,083 --> 01:57:35,083
That was cured after delivery.

2119
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:37,875
I cleared my exams well and
reached twelfth class.

2120
01:57:40,458 --> 01:57:41,750
My dad passed away when I
was in twelfth class.

2121
01:57:44,875 --> 01:57:46,292
It was a bike accident.

2122
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:47,792
He never used to wear a helmet.

2123
01:57:48,292 --> 01:57:49,583
How do you do this?

2124
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:52,625
<i>I was attending my model exams.</i>

2125
01:57:52,708 --> 01:57:54,750
<i>A few people came to call me</i>
<i>saying my dad is critical.</i>

2126
01:57:55,542 --> 01:57:56,958
-Yeah.
-Please come here.

2127
01:57:58,750 --> 01:58:01,875
<i>They were constantly consoling me.</i>

2128
01:58:02,917 --> 01:58:04,917
<i>But I was intelligent</i>
<i>enough to understand that,</i>

2129
01:58:05,458 --> 01:58:06,583
<i>my dad has passed away.</i>

2130
01:58:10,833 --> 01:58:13,083
I always carry an extra
house keys in my school bag.

2131
01:58:14,208 --> 01:58:15,833
That very day, the keys went missing.

2132
01:58:16,917 --> 01:58:18,333
<i>Since my mom was in hospital,</i>

2133
01:58:18,667 --> 01:58:19,708
<i>I was waiting at a neighbor's house.</i>

2134
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:23,333
The aunty in that house
gave me a horrible drink.

2135
01:58:24,875 --> 01:58:26,500
It still gives me vomiting sensation.

2136
01:58:32,792 --> 01:58:34,458
I expected my father's corpse inside it.

2137
01:58:36,292 --> 01:58:37,542
Instead I saw my mom's
dead body first.

2138
01:58:42,208 --> 01:58:43,792
My parents were taking Karthik
for a polio vaccination.

2139
01:58:44,917 --> 01:58:45,958
That's when they met with an accident.

2140
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:51,958
You know I could feel the exact
moment I was losing my senses.

2141
01:58:53,083 --> 01:58:54,292
Initially, we feel a chill inside.

2142
01:58:54,833 --> 01:58:56,042
Our body starts shivering.

2143
01:58:57,792 --> 01:59:00,000
We will keep on rambling.

2144
01:59:01,583 --> 01:59:03,250
I was blabbering a lot that day.

2145
01:59:04,375 --> 01:59:05,458
<i>Please tell dad not to take the bike.</i>

2146
01:59:06,625 --> 01:59:08,000
<i>Don't take my mom along.</i>

2147
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:09,500
We can take an auto.

2148
01:59:11,917 --> 01:59:14,542
That's when a bearded
guy came with him.

2149
01:59:17,833 --> 01:59:19,708
<i>He had a plaster in his hand.</i>

2150
01:59:22,917 --> 01:59:24,875
When I saw him, I just broke down.

2151
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,042
But it was more of a relief.

2152
01:59:31,583 --> 01:59:33,000
At least one of them was spared.

2153
01:59:37,083 --> 01:59:41,208
We both then laid down
next to our parents.

2154
01:59:44,583 --> 01:59:47,125
That's the last time we slept together.

2155
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:10,292
When I get stressed...

2156
02:00:11,292 --> 02:00:13,250
I hug him and lie down.

2157
02:00:13,875 --> 02:00:14,875
I sleep well.

2158
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,083
He's my sleeping pill.

2159
02:00:29,292 --> 02:00:32,708
<i>Cheekiness in your veins, my little brat</i>

2160
02:00:32,833 --> 02:00:38,417
<i>Guide you upwards, onwards with love</i>

2161
02:00:39,417 --> 02:00:43,250
<i>There's someone for you, very special</i>

2162
02:00:43,583 --> 02:00:46,958
<i>To conquer you well, in his armory</i>

2163
02:00:47,042 --> 02:00:53,083
<i>With the precious pouch of affection</i>

2164
02:00:53,875 --> 02:00:57,042
<i>In the sweet nectar of love</i>

2165
02:00:57,417 --> 02:01:00,792
<i>Mischief at every step</i>

2166
02:01:00,875 --> 02:01:04,500
<i>In every move</i>

2167
02:01:04,625 --> 02:01:08,083
<i>The child in you is embraced</i>
<i>Patted with love</i>

2168
02:01:08,167 --> 02:01:12,375
<i>There's no one like him, your brother</i>

2169
02:01:12,458 --> 02:01:15,917
<i>Cheekiness in your veins, my little brat</i>

2170
02:01:16,042 --> 02:01:21,625
<i>Guide you upwards, onwards with love</i>

2171
02:01:22,542 --> 02:01:27,875
<i>There's someone for you, very special</i>

2172
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:51,417
-Here's your bedsheet.
-Okay.

2173
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:52,667
You can go to bed.

2174
02:01:58,625 --> 02:02:01,667
When you love someone, you
may have disagreements.

2175
02:02:01,792 --> 02:02:03,667
It's always a great feeling
to have someone in life.

2176
02:02:04,125 --> 02:02:07,125
I understood that when
my husband passed away.

2177
02:02:10,958 --> 02:02:13,875
Do you know how I am
related to these boys?

2178
02:02:14,625 --> 02:02:15,500
Aunty?

2179
02:02:15,667 --> 02:02:16,500
No.

2180
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:18,792
-Grandmother?
-No.

2181
02:02:19,042 --> 02:02:20,958
How can I be their grandmother?

2182
02:02:21,042 --> 02:02:22,667
I am very young.

2183
02:02:22,917 --> 02:02:26,333
I was in the same <i>WhatsApp</i>
group with their aunt.

2184
02:02:26,458 --> 02:02:28,333
-What?
-Yeah.

2185
02:02:28,708 --> 02:02:30,500
It was a <i>WhatsApp</i> group
for yoga class.

2186
02:02:30,875 --> 02:02:31,750
Okay.

2187
02:02:32,083 --> 02:02:33,833
One day, she was
saying in the group...

2188
02:02:34,458 --> 02:02:37,750
fraud needs to take his younger
brother along to Madras.

2189
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:40,917
He needed someone to
take care of Karthik.

2190
02:02:41,667 --> 02:02:44,000
I like Madras.
So, I took the offer.

2191
02:02:44,708 --> 02:02:46,208
I like this place a lot.

2192
02:02:46,875 --> 02:02:48,167
That's how I reached here.

2193
02:02:48,958 --> 02:02:50,167
I didn't know that.

2194
02:02:51,042 --> 02:02:53,208
I thought you belonged
to the same family.

2195
02:02:55,292 --> 02:02:58,875
I met them for the first
time at the railway station.

2196
02:02:59,292 --> 02:03:00,958
But you know something?

2197
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:07,250
I like them more than
my own family right now.

2198
02:03:07,875 --> 02:03:13,000
Most probably, I'll be happy with
these boys until my last breath.

2199
02:03:17,625 --> 02:03:18,625
Dear...

2200
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:23,208
sometimes certain people enter
our lives unexpectedly.

2201
02:03:23,458 --> 02:03:25,042
It may be a good thing.

2202
02:03:25,458 --> 02:03:28,417
We just need to
keep an open mind.

2203
02:03:29,125 --> 02:03:30,125
Okay, goodnight.

2204
02:03:31,542 --> 02:03:32,958
You're a sweetheart.

2205
02:04:06,875 --> 02:04:09,958
<i>The girl with a sparkle in her eyes,</i>

2206
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:15,375
<i>Peeks into our minds,</i>
<i>With a mystic mischief</i>

2207
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
<i>She's the special one, the sassy one</i>

2208
02:04:19,333 --> 02:04:24,375
<i>Far across the branches so high, she leaps</i>

2209
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:30,042
<i>When she sees those anthills, so round</i>

2210
02:04:30,292 --> 02:04:36,625
<i>She hops and bounds across them,</i>
<i>With spirits so high</i>

2211
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:39,750
<i>Think before you combat her,</i>

2212
02:04:39,833 --> 02:04:42,042
<i>For every discord with her,</i>

2213
02:04:42,292 --> 02:04:46,292
<i>With her eyes, so red and sharp</i>
<i>She's the one to deal with,</i>

2214
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:51,750
<i>Viscous is she,</i>
<i>Yet so fluid like the honey</i>

2215
02:04:53,125 --> 02:04:56,500
<i>Cheekiness in your veins, my sassy girl</i>

2216
02:04:56,708 --> 02:05:01,667
<i>Guide you upwards, onwards with love</i>

2217
02:05:03,292 --> 02:05:06,500
<i>There's someone for you, very special</i>

2218
02:05:25,083 --> 02:05:26,583
May be, I was not always there for her.

2219
02:05:27,042 --> 02:05:29,875
But I have never made
her feel lonely.

2220
02:05:31,458 --> 02:05:32,833
Sometimes, I do miss her.

2221
02:05:33,542 --> 02:05:35,792
Then, I hold my hands close.

2222
02:05:36,917 --> 02:05:40,083
And I still can feel her
hands inside mine.

2223
02:05:46,667 --> 02:05:47,708
Have some water.

2224
02:05:50,458 --> 02:05:51,625
It's good that you let go.

2225
02:05:52,917 --> 02:05:53,750
Are you feeling better now?

2226
02:05:58,542 --> 02:06:01,583
<i>Like the spicy chilly on your tongue</i>

2227
02:06:02,167 --> 02:06:06,792
<i>Like the burning ember,</i>
<i>We fail to approach</i>

2228
02:06:07,583 --> 02:06:09,917
<i>She's not the one we know</i>

2229
02:06:11,167 --> 02:06:16,000
<i>Her quirks have changed, for the good</i>

2230
02:06:16,583 --> 02:06:21,542
<i>She is one among us now</i>

2231
02:06:21,917 --> 02:06:28,417
<i>Fables are favorite to her now</i>

2232
02:06:29,750 --> 02:06:33,333
<i>To hide behind, to run away far</i>

2233
02:06:33,417 --> 02:06:38,042
<i>She may never do that to us</i>

2234
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:44,167
<i>The desire to be stroked, slow and long</i>

2235
02:06:44,750 --> 02:06:48,125
<i>Cheekiness in your veins, my sassy girl</i>

2236
02:06:48,417 --> 02:06:53,792
<i>Guide you upwards, onwards with love</i>

2237
02:06:54,958 --> 02:06:59,000
<i>There's someone for you, very special</i>

2238
02:06:59,083 --> 02:07:02,417
<i>To conquer you well, in her armory</i>

2239
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:07,792
<i>With the precious pouch of affection</i>

2240
02:07:09,417 --> 02:07:11,292
<i>In the sweet nectar of love</i>

2241
02:07:12,917 --> 02:07:19,833
<i>Mischief at every step, in every move</i>

2242
02:07:20,208 --> 02:07:23,583
<i>The child in you is embraced,</i>
<i>Patted with love</i>

2243
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:27,625
<i>There's no one like her, your mother</i>

2244
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,292
<i>Cheekiness in your veins, my sassy girl</i>

2245
02:07:31,625 --> 02:07:36,917
<i>Guide you upwards, onwards with love</i>

2246
02:07:38,042 --> 02:07:42,750
<i>There's someone for you, very special</i>

2247
02:07:52,125 --> 02:07:54,083
-Are you here to meet a new guy today?
-Yes.

2248
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:56,250
But this is going to be the final one.

2249
02:07:56,375 --> 02:07:57,417
Cheers.

2250
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:12,833
Yes.

2251
02:08:13,417 --> 02:08:14,625
Brother, get me a cup of coffee.

2252
02:08:14,958 --> 02:08:15,958
Do you drink?

2253
02:08:16,792 --> 02:08:17,792
I prefer tea.

2254
02:08:18,542 --> 02:08:19,583
Do you drink alcohol?

2255
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:22,583
I used to but not anymore.

2256
02:08:23,292 --> 02:08:24,125
Okay.

2257
02:08:24,542 --> 02:08:26,042
I don't smoke.

2258
02:08:27,833 --> 02:08:29,125
Do you believe in horoscope?

2259
02:08:30,167 --> 02:08:31,792
No, I don't.

2260
02:08:32,125 --> 02:08:33,417
But I believe in destiny.

2261
02:08:34,042 --> 02:08:36,417
I guess, my destiny is taking me
in the right direction now.

2262
02:08:37,292 --> 02:08:38,250
Tell me about your family.

2263
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:41,792
I have my mother, just like you.

2264
02:08:42,958 --> 02:08:44,583
She's no more though.

2265
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:47,333
Okay.

2266
02:08:48,167 --> 02:08:49,792
My mother is attending
an event today evening.

2267
02:08:51,833 --> 02:08:53,125
I booked her ticket.

2268
02:08:53,750 --> 02:08:56,292
I have booked an
extra ticket beside her.

2269
02:08:57,583 --> 02:08:58,500
Take this.

2270
02:09:00,583 --> 02:09:01,458
Is that okay?

2271
02:09:01,625 --> 02:09:02,500
That's fine.

2272
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:04,375
Then I am all right.

2273
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,208
Do you know my name?

2274
02:09:10,167 --> 02:09:11,417
You may call me Nikki.

2275
02:09:11,917 --> 02:09:12,750
Okay.

2276
02:09:12,958 --> 02:09:13,833
See you.

2277
02:09:17,375 --> 02:09:18,208
She's good.

2278
02:09:19,333 --> 02:09:20,542
What should I do?

2279
02:09:23,333 --> 02:09:24,917
<i>Major, I am really busy here.</i>

2280
02:09:25,125 --> 02:09:25,958
<i>Please come here directly.</i>

2281
02:09:26,208 --> 02:09:27,292
<i>Don't make an excuse.</i>

2282
02:09:27,417 --> 02:09:29,083
<i>No one agreed to come</i>
<i>for the function.</i>

2283
02:09:29,417 --> 02:09:32,333
<i>If you don't turn up, I will have</i>
<i>to go to the Himalayas with them.</i>

2284
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:33,625
<i>Please do come.</i>

2285
02:09:40,625 --> 02:09:41,958
Sir, I have brought the water can.

2286
02:09:42,042 --> 02:09:42,875
Okay.

2287
02:09:46,833 --> 02:09:49,208
The shirt is wrinkled.

2288
02:09:49,625 --> 02:09:51,292
-Can you iron it for me?
-Okay, sir.

2289
02:09:54,208 --> 02:09:55,292
This is fantastic.

2290
02:09:55,542 --> 02:09:57,625
If you wear this jacket
along with this shirt,

2291
02:09:57,833 --> 02:10:01,500
you will look like Kamal Hassan.

2292
02:10:01,750 --> 02:10:03,708
-Please iron it.
-Okay, sir.

2293
02:10:16,583 --> 02:10:17,583
Hello, ma'am.

2294
02:10:20,042 --> 02:10:21,042
You're going to give
a speech today, right?

2295
02:10:21,208 --> 02:10:22,125
Yes.

2296
02:10:22,542 --> 02:10:23,708
Have you practiced well?

2297
02:10:23,833 --> 02:10:25,833
That's not a big deal.

2298
02:10:26,083 --> 02:10:28,792
When I get on stage, my
legs start trembling.

2299
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:30,750
I came to give this.

2300
02:10:31,417 --> 02:10:32,250
What?

2301
02:10:32,417 --> 02:10:33,667
No, this is something else.

2302
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:35,708
I have prepared the speech.

2303
02:10:35,792 --> 02:10:37,625
-You can refer this on stage.
-Really?

2304
02:10:37,708 --> 02:10:38,708
Yeah.

2305
02:10:41,875 --> 02:10:43,542
Isn't Nikki home?

2306
02:10:43,958 --> 02:10:45,417
She has gone to consult a dentist.

2307
02:10:45,708 --> 02:10:46,875
-Tooth ache?
-No.

2308
02:10:47,708 --> 02:10:49,417
Nikki is going out with fraud.

2309
02:10:49,708 --> 02:10:52,417
So, if my intuitions are right,
she hasn't gone to a dentist.

2310
02:10:52,750 --> 02:10:53,625
They are dating.

2311
02:10:55,417 --> 02:10:57,250
Listen, shall we go on a date?

2312
02:10:57,375 --> 02:10:58,208
What?

2313
02:10:58,333 --> 02:11:00,292
I have a function to attend.

2314
02:11:00,375 --> 02:11:01,542
We may go after that.

2315
02:11:02,583 --> 02:11:04,417
I am attending a
program today evening.

2316
02:11:06,417 --> 02:11:08,083
Nikki booked my ticket.

2317
02:11:08,333 --> 02:11:10,625
But I booked one more ticket.

2318
02:11:14,375 --> 02:11:16,458
The adjacent seat was
already booked by then.

2319
02:11:16,542 --> 02:11:17,500
Oh, God.

2320
02:11:18,167 --> 02:11:20,042
That's okay. We may exchange.

2321
02:11:20,292 --> 02:11:21,292
That's good.

2322
02:11:21,458 --> 02:11:23,292
Ma'am is searching for you.

2323
02:11:23,375 --> 02:11:25,208
The episode where the son is
getting murdered has been out.

2324
02:11:25,292 --> 02:11:26,708
She wants to watch it with you.

2325
02:11:26,792 --> 02:11:27,792
Okay.

2326
02:11:30,167 --> 02:11:31,917
-Sir, here's your shirt.
-Seven o'clock.

2327
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:32,833
Okay.

2328
02:11:32,917 --> 02:11:33,875
Don't forget.

2329
02:11:34,667 --> 02:11:36,542
Come inside.
I will serve you tea.

2330
02:11:36,708 --> 02:11:38,125
-Sir, that's okay.
-I shall serve you.

2331
02:11:38,333 --> 02:11:39,333
Sir, I don't want it.

2332
02:12:03,542 --> 02:12:05,833
-No, I have seen it.
-I have already seen it.

2333
02:12:05,917 --> 02:12:07,417
-He will die today.
-Ganga.

2334
02:12:10,167 --> 02:12:11,750
Sorry, I was speaking to him.

2335
02:12:13,167 --> 02:12:14,625
I won't spare you.

2336
02:12:16,208 --> 02:12:18,083
Don't run!
I will kill you!

2337
02:12:18,167 --> 02:12:19,208
He's crazy.

2338
02:12:19,292 --> 02:12:20,833
-Show it to me.
-Be careful with the order of the program.

2339
02:12:22,542 --> 02:12:23,417
Has he arrived?

2340
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:24,958
He has come but anything can happen.

2341
02:12:25,042 --> 02:12:26,083
What?

2342
02:12:27,208 --> 02:12:28,208
Hello, everybody.

2343
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:31,208
We have the flag off ceremony now.

2344
02:12:31,583 --> 02:12:35,167
We have the apt person
to do the honors for us.

2345
02:12:35,375 --> 02:12:37,000
To introduce him--

2346
02:12:37,083 --> 02:12:37,917
That's not needed.

2347
02:12:38,458 --> 02:12:41,625
He will introduce himself.

2348
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,625
Let me invite him onto the stage.

2349
02:12:43,875 --> 02:12:45,708
One of the Indians to have
conquered Mount Everest,

2350
02:12:46,083 --> 02:12:47,083
our dearest...

2351
02:12:51,125 --> 02:12:54,292
Please come to the dais.

2352
02:12:54,875 --> 02:12:56,375
Please give him a big
round of applause.

2353
02:12:59,333 --> 02:13:01,167
Major, please come.

2354
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:04,583
In his customary attire
wearing his honors,

2355
02:13:04,667 --> 02:13:06,458
my beloved Major Unnikrishnan is here.

2356
02:13:07,958 --> 02:13:09,542
Please come to the dais.

2357
02:13:14,333 --> 02:13:15,417
-Are you prepared?
-Yeah.

2358
02:13:15,625 --> 02:13:16,792
I am also prepared.

2359
02:13:16,875 --> 02:13:18,708
If you struggle on
stage like that day

2360
02:13:18,792 --> 02:13:20,125
just give me a cue.

2361
02:13:20,208 --> 02:13:21,417
I have arranged crackers
to distract the attention.

2362
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:23,375
You can walk out of the stage.

2363
02:13:23,958 --> 02:13:24,958
Plan B, right?

2364
02:13:25,042 --> 02:13:26,625
Yes, an alternate option.

2365
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:33,292
Praise the lord!

2366
02:13:51,333 --> 02:13:52,667
Hello, everybody.

2367
02:13:55,417 --> 02:13:56,667
I have been...

2368
02:13:57,750 --> 02:14:01,917
certain of two things in my life.

2369
02:14:02,833 --> 02:14:03,917
The first one is...

2370
02:14:04,375 --> 02:14:06,708
I had been a good soldier.

2371
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:10,542
I had my share of laurels.

2372
02:14:11,958 --> 02:14:13,250
The second thing is...

2373
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:15,792
I was an avid traveler.

2374
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:19,542
Travel does influence you a lot.

2375
02:14:20,125 --> 02:14:23,292
You reach a land
with a different language.

2376
02:14:24,417 --> 02:14:26,458
You wake up in a new place.

2377
02:14:27,167 --> 02:14:30,083
You meet new people
with varied backgrounds.

2378
02:14:30,417 --> 02:14:31,583
You explore different food.

2379
02:14:32,917 --> 02:14:36,958
This will help you to rediscover yourself.

2380
02:14:38,167 --> 02:14:41,458
The Himalayas... is an experience.

2381
02:14:43,375 --> 02:14:46,667
Your dreams will now have new
dimension of avalanche in it.

2382
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:52,083
People usually say that...

2383
02:14:53,208 --> 02:14:56,292
they wish the journey never ended.

2384
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:57,958
But I think...

2385
02:14:58,625 --> 02:15:00,958
a journey becomes more meaningful...

2386
02:15:01,792 --> 02:15:02,958
when it has a return ticket.

2387
02:15:03,792 --> 02:15:04,750
Am I right?

2388
02:15:05,042 --> 02:15:06,708
You should have a home to return to.

2389
02:15:07,208 --> 02:15:09,708
You should have a person to
share your enriched experiences.

2390
02:15:10,708 --> 02:15:12,375
Otherwise, it's a futile exercise.

2391
02:15:13,792 --> 02:15:15,917
But there's something
that I regret not doing.

2392
02:15:17,583 --> 02:15:19,625
You should make notes
about your experience.

2393
02:15:20,667 --> 02:15:25,375
The notes of those memories will
give you an unadulterated happiness.

2394
02:15:26,208 --> 02:15:30,167
Traveling should never be an option
to run away from your loved ones.

2395
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,042
I have done that...

2396
02:15:32,833 --> 02:15:33,833
to my mom.

2397
02:15:35,208 --> 02:15:37,500
She was mute.

2398
02:15:38,208 --> 02:15:40,667
She was really lonely.

2399
02:15:42,083 --> 02:15:45,375
But she was lucky enough
to leave this world early.

2400
02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:49,792
She often communicated
with me through food.

2401
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:54,083
After school, I used to run
straight to the kitchen.

2402
02:15:54,875 --> 02:15:55,833
I would be really hungry.

2403
02:15:56,542 --> 02:15:58,417
She would have kept a
vessel there for me.

2404
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:02,375
The snacks in it determined
my mom's mood that day.

2405
02:16:03,333 --> 02:16:05,167
If it was spicy, she was in a bad mood.

2406
02:16:05,708 --> 02:16:07,458
If it was sweet,
she was sweet as well.

2407
02:16:08,083 --> 02:16:10,000
If it was salty,
she would quarrel with me.

2408
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:13,583
Sometimes, the vessel
would be empty.

2409
02:16:14,667 --> 02:16:16,292
She would be crying the whole day.

2410
02:16:17,625 --> 02:16:19,542
When my mom died, I didn't cry.

2411
02:16:20,333 --> 02:16:22,000
A couple of years later,

2412
02:16:22,333 --> 02:16:24,333
when I came across a grand dinner...

2413
02:16:25,167 --> 02:16:26,167
I got reminded of her.

2414
02:16:27,458 --> 02:16:29,458
An official dinner in Belgium.

2415
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:33,625
It was a grand gala dinner with
delicacies from across the world.

2416
02:16:34,833 --> 02:16:36,667
But I could not eat anything.

2417
02:16:37,167 --> 02:16:38,333
Her memories were overwhelming.

2418
02:16:39,667 --> 02:16:42,333
There was a closed
container on the table.

2419
02:16:43,292 --> 02:16:44,417
When I opened it...

2420
02:16:45,583 --> 02:16:47,333
there was a snack
prepared with coconut.

2421
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,333
Just like how she used to make.

2422
02:16:50,417 --> 02:16:51,417
I had that.

2423
02:16:52,583 --> 02:16:53,958
I could only eat that.

2424
02:16:54,667 --> 02:16:55,667
It was sweet.

2425
02:16:57,708 --> 02:16:58,750
That's when I realized...

2426
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:03,042
I should have traveled
back to my home.

2427
02:17:19,833 --> 02:17:21,333
Let me conclude by...

2428
02:17:22,083 --> 02:17:25,208
conveying all my best wishes
to the Himalayan trip riders.

2429
02:17:30,833 --> 02:17:32,625
Major, you are awesome.

2430
02:17:32,708 --> 02:17:33,542
My treatment is a success.

2431
02:17:36,542 --> 02:17:38,000
I AM HERE WITH YOU.

2432
02:17:41,083 --> 02:17:42,250
I would like to end it by saying this.

2433
02:17:43,292 --> 02:17:46,708
I was invited because I had
conquered Mount Everest before.

2434
02:17:47,167 --> 02:17:52,167
But certain things in real life are
harder than conquering Mount Everest.

2435
02:17:52,375 --> 02:17:53,250
I realized it now.

2436
02:17:55,667 --> 02:17:57,000
If you love someone...

2437
02:17:58,083 --> 02:18:02,000
the difficulty to express it is much
more than conquering Mount Everest.

2438
02:18:08,417 --> 02:18:10,333
My dear, Major Unnikrishnan.

2439
02:18:10,958 --> 02:18:12,167
You were just awesome.

2440
02:18:12,417 --> 02:18:14,208
You don't need any more treatment.

2441
02:18:14,417 --> 02:18:15,667
You can throw the task book away.

2442
02:18:16,417 --> 02:18:18,292
Oh, the cue.

2443
02:18:18,375 --> 02:18:19,875
Burst the crackers!

2444
02:18:42,125 --> 02:18:43,833
Your mom doesn't know
about the date, right?

2445
02:18:43,958 --> 02:18:44,792
What did you tell her?

2446
02:18:44,958 --> 02:18:46,208
I told her that I need to see a dentist.

2447
02:18:47,167 --> 02:18:49,208
The lie makes the date
even more special.

2448
02:18:49,625 --> 02:18:50,625
Let's go and watch a movie.

2449
02:18:53,208 --> 02:18:54,125
Wait.

2450
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:55,292
Where's the helmet?

2451
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:56,458
I thought about it.

2452
02:18:56,583 --> 02:18:57,625
But it will ruin my hair.

2453
02:18:57,708 --> 02:18:58,875
Oh, wait.

2454
02:19:01,417 --> 02:19:02,958
We shall go by an auto-rickshaw.

2455
02:19:03,375 --> 02:19:04,250
What?

2456
02:19:04,917 --> 02:19:06,833
Bibeesh P, don't ruin the moment.

2457
02:19:06,917 --> 02:19:07,833
Please start the bike.

2458
02:19:07,917 --> 02:19:10,125
A bike date means
a helmet is mandatory.

2459
02:19:10,250 --> 02:19:11,417
There's no compromise in it.

2460
02:19:14,583 --> 02:19:17,375
Hey... this is my first romantic date.

2461
02:19:18,417 --> 02:19:19,625
I have great expectations.

2462
02:19:20,167 --> 02:19:24,833
I always wanted to go on a bike
with my hair flowing in the wind.

2463
02:19:25,875 --> 02:19:27,333
Even you don't wear a helmet.

2464
02:19:28,667 --> 02:19:32,042
Bibeesh P, I like your hairstyle a lot.

2465
02:19:32,542 --> 02:19:33,500
And your...

2466
02:19:33,583 --> 02:19:34,500
A helmet is mandatory.

2467
02:19:35,333 --> 02:19:37,250
I can't find an auto-rickshaw.

2468
02:19:38,625 --> 02:19:39,750
Perhaps, I may hug you as well.

2469
02:19:40,125 --> 02:19:40,958
What?

2470
02:19:42,458 --> 02:19:43,708
Okay, let's go.

2471
02:19:45,625 --> 02:19:46,625
Get onto the bike.

2472
02:19:48,583 --> 02:19:49,500
Let's go!

2473
02:19:49,917 --> 02:19:50,917
Hug me tight.

2474
02:20:18,750 --> 02:20:20,750
These are my seats.

2475
02:20:21,083 --> 02:20:22,458
Please move.

2476
02:20:47,167 --> 02:20:48,417
Please sit down.

2477
02:20:52,208 --> 02:20:54,667
-Sit down.
-I had reserved these seats.

2478
02:20:59,958 --> 02:21:02,000
Are you wearing a kurta
for the first time?

2479
02:21:02,292 --> 02:21:06,333
No, I had worn it during
the festival

2480
02:21:06,542 --> 02:21:07,917
but you didn't notice it.

2481
02:21:08,875 --> 02:21:09,875
It's nice.

2482
02:21:15,958 --> 02:21:17,167
Can I tell you something?

2483
02:21:17,375 --> 02:21:18,375
Yeah.

2484
02:21:19,875 --> 02:21:20,875
I think...

2485
02:21:26,583 --> 02:21:28,167
-I want to tell you--
-It's okay, don't say it.

2486
02:21:29,292 --> 02:21:30,625
Please let me say it.

2487
02:21:34,208 --> 02:21:37,750
You resemble the actress Shobana.

2488
02:21:55,833 --> 02:21:58,917
<i>Fallen are the mighty, long and deep</i>

2489
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:02,958
<i>When the feminine gazes pierce</i>

2490
02:22:03,042 --> 02:22:04,542
<i>Love is like a chocolate</i>

2491
02:22:04,750 --> 02:22:07,708
<i>They have fallen more in the past</i>

2492
02:22:07,792 --> 02:22:12,208
<i>So many spiritual sages</i>

2493
02:22:24,042 --> 02:22:25,208
It's nice.

2494
02:22:25,500 --> 02:22:26,750
-Didn't I tell you?
-Oh, my God.

2495
02:22:27,208 --> 02:22:28,583
-It's the police!
-Stop the vehicle.

2496
02:22:31,292 --> 02:22:33,417
Sir, they were not wearing helmets.

2497
02:22:34,917 --> 02:22:35,875
Sir, are you a Malayali?

2498
02:22:37,375 --> 02:22:39,917
Is it difficult for you to
wear it on your head instead?

2499
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,083
You might not believe me.

2500
02:22:41,458 --> 02:22:42,375
But please believe me.

2501
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:44,958
I never rode my
bike without a helmet.

2502
02:22:45,167 --> 02:22:46,375
I won't believe it.

2503
02:22:46,458 --> 02:22:49,667
I used to make the
pillion riders wear a helmet.

2504
02:22:49,750 --> 02:22:51,250
-Believe me, sir.
-I don't believe you.

2505
02:22:51,333 --> 02:22:53,125
-I asked him for a lift.
-Is she with you?

2506
02:22:53,208 --> 02:22:54,917
Who? Yeah.

2507
02:22:55,250 --> 02:22:56,667
Okay, I believe you.

2508
02:22:59,042 --> 02:22:59,917
Come here.

2509
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:02,792
Oh, my God! Baahubali!

2510
02:23:02,875 --> 02:23:04,208
Pay the penalty.

2511
02:23:04,542 --> 02:23:05,708
I don't have cash.

2512
02:23:06,167 --> 02:23:07,917
Shall I withdraw it from an ATM?

2513
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:09,667
No, that's not happening again.

2514
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Pay the penalty.

2515
02:23:13,083 --> 02:23:13,958
-Yeah.
-Do you have money?

2516
02:23:14,042 --> 02:23:17,000
The money is for our date.
I have to pay the penalty.

2517
02:23:17,083 --> 02:23:18,333
I won't charge a penalty for that.

2518
02:23:18,583 --> 02:23:20,542
You have a lifetime
penalty by your side.

2519
02:23:20,792 --> 02:23:22,000
Take the money.

2520
02:23:22,417 --> 02:23:23,625
There's something fishy.

2521
02:23:24,125 --> 02:23:25,125
Give it to me.

2522
02:23:25,208 --> 02:23:26,208
Fine, get going.

2523
02:23:26,375 --> 02:23:27,375
I will pay this.

2524
02:23:27,458 --> 02:23:28,375
Wear your helmet.

2525
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:29,958
Doing it right away, sir.

2526
02:23:30,500 --> 02:23:31,417
See?

2527
02:23:37,458 --> 02:23:39,292
-How about our date?
-Screw the date.

2528
02:23:39,500 --> 02:23:40,542
We can have tea.

2529
02:23:40,625 --> 02:23:41,583
Didn't I tell you to wear a helmet?

2530
02:23:43,292 --> 02:23:45,833
<i>Love is a little dangerous</i>

2531
02:23:47,417 --> 02:23:50,167
<i>One step forward, no steps backward</i>

2532
02:23:52,167 --> 02:23:55,208
<i>Make your move</i>
<i>Marked with love and precision</i>

2533
02:23:58,042 --> 02:23:59,042
<i>What should I do?</i>
