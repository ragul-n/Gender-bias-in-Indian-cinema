1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:02,712
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.

2
00:00:05,437 --> 00:00:07,849
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,584
It causes CANCER.

4
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:16,884
Cigarette smoking is
injurious to health.

5
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:21,229
It causes CANCER.

6
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:58,510
Please. Please.
- Get lost. Go on.

7
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:01,424
Constable.

8
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:04,290
Here's Rs. 100.
- What for?

9
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:05,823
I ran a red light yesterday.

10
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,330
A woman was pregnant.
I had to rush her to the hospital.

11
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:09,627
This is the fine for
breaking the signal.

12
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:10,666
Wow, Savitribai.

13
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:11,633
If everyone can be as honest as you..

14
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,794
“There will be no need for us.

15
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,269
Okay, Jai Hind.

16
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:16,567
Hey. Where's the receipt?

17
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:19,305
Oh! I completely forgot.

18
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,309
Here's your receipt.

19
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,868
How's your son? Where is he?

20
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,113
He is fine.
He's studying in school now.

21
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,847
When he grows up I'll
make him a police officer.

22
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:27,310
I see, you mean like us.

23
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,743
I'll make him an
honest police officer.

24
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:31,114
Jai Hind.

25
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:35,489
Children. This is India.

26
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:38,153
In the North are the Himalayas.

27
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:41,198
And in the South is the Indian Ocean.

28
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,325
Vishwas.

29
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:45,526
Vishwasl
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,735
What's in the South of India?
- Rajnikant.

31
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:49,668
Quiet!

32
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:50,898
And what's“

33
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:52,800
What's that in your hands?
- Nothing.

34
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:54,868
Nothing.
- Show me.

35
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,578
So this is what you read in class?

36
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:58,512
Film magazines!

37
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,277
Sir, this belongs to Gopi not me.

38
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:02,216
Gopi..
- No, sir. He asked me to get it.

39
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,651
Sir, he did“
- No, sir, it was him..

40
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:04,744
Quiet!

41
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,187
You don't have a father.

42
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:07,383
Your mother works hard all day“

43
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:08,516
“to pay for your education“

44
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,725
...so that you can become
someone successful.

45
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,788
I want to be successful like someone,
sir. - Like whom?

46
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,830
Shahrukh Khan? Salman Khan?
Amir Khan?

47
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,459
No, sir. Why would
I be successful like them?

48
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,865
I am Rao. Vishwas Rao.

49
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,693
Hero Vishwas Rao.

50
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,764
What did you study in school today?

51
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:27,675
Don't ask about the study.
I'm tired of studying all day.

52
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,438
I see. Here.
I've brought dry-fruits for you.

53
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:33,876
Mom. Let me drive for a while.

54
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:35,646
No. Not yet.

55
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,849
Only after you turn
18 and get a license“

56
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,151
...you can drive then.

57
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:42,317
Come on, mom.
Let me drive for a while.

58
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,793
No one's watching anyway.

59
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:47,788
Get down!

60
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,597
Don't ever say that again.

61
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:54,429
I'm watching, God's watching.

62
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,535
So never do anything wrong.

63
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:57,573
Do you get that?
- Yes.

64
00:04:58,864 --> 00:04:59,842
No, you didn't.

65
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:01,437
I'll explain to you.

66
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:06,444
Stand in front of all
the trees here and say“

67
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:12,514
"I swear on you, my mother and God.."

68
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,683
"..that I will never
do anything wrong."

69
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,749
Go on.

70
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,760
Go.

71
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:25,334
Say it.

72
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:31,265
I swear on you, my mother and God“

73
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,867
“that I will never do anything wrong.

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,581
"I'll become an honest
police officer."

75
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:46,653
I'll become an honest police officer.

76
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,318
Bravo.

77
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,721
In future he'll be a police officer.

78
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,766
I want you to train him..

79
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,464
“So that he can beat-up the bad guys.

80
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,333
Definitely, sister.
He will beat them all up.

81
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:03,202
I will train him so well“

82
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,242
“that he'll beat
up 10 bad guys at a time.

83
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:07,572
That's it, only 10?

84
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:13,342
You're going to become a
police officer? - Yes, Gopi. I am.

85
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:15,043
I will be a police officer.

86
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,612
I'll be a Don.

87
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:20,248
I'll be a judge. I'll be a doctor.

88
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:21,791
I'll be an engineer too.

89
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:23,690
But how can you be all that?

90
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,786
Because I'll be a movie-star.

91
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,728
Help!
- Wait.

92
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,167
Help!

93
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,659
Hey Vishu.

94
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,300
Who are you?

95
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:49,464
I just showed a little style,
a little attitude“

96
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,303
“and you're already scared.

97
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,503
The hero's just made his entry.

98
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,846
Wait and watch what happens next.

99
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:57,812
Thrash him.

100
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,816
Hey morons.

101
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:04,342
If you have the guts...then..

102
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,787
“Don't come one-by-one.

103
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:07,789
Come together.

104
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,058
I'm in a hurry.

105
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,053
Start!

106
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:23,391
Catch them.

107
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:30,800
Through the poster, emerges the hero.

108
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:32,500
Fantastic dialogues.

109
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,907
Terrific fighting.

110
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:37,503
Just like a hero.
- That's what I want to be, Gopi.

111
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:38,513
Just wait and watch.

112
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,880
Soon you'll see huge posters of me.

113
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,748
Did you hear, aunt?
- No, mom.

114
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,413
Hero?

115
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:46,353
Go on.

116
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,448
Your mother will definitely
make you a police officer.

117
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,487
Tomorrow is your entrance exam.

118
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:51,789
Go and prepare.

119
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:58,599
<i>Vishwas Ram'</i>

120
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,731
May I come in, sir?
- Come in.

121
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:04,073
Thank you, sir.

122
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,341
Sir!

123
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:09,712
Are you unwell?
- No, sir.

124
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:14,775
You see, sir...l get breathless soon.

125
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,477
But nothing to worry about, sir.

126
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,283
It's been like this since childhood.

127
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:20,745
Sir!

128
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:23,349
Did you hurt your leg?
- No, sir.

129
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:26,225
You see...I've one short leg.

130
00:11:27,385 --> 00:11:28,864
But nothing to worry about, sir.

131
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,422
It's been like this since childhood.

132
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,299
And yet you want to join
the police force? - Yes, sir.

133
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,538
I want to join the police
force and serve the country.

134
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,472
That's been my childhood dream.

135
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,406
Sir!

136
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:40,602
Fine.

137
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:43,145
Let's check your eyes.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:47,914
Read the first letter.

139
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:49,581
Which letter sir?

140
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,581
First letter. It's up there.

141
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:54,716
Up where, sir?

142
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,690
Up on the chart.

143
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:58,819
What chart, sir?

144
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,565
The chart that's on the stand.
- What stand, sir?

145
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,759
Impossible!

146
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,737
What was that?
- Nothing, sir.

147
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:09,863
What was that?

148
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:13,108
Sometimes I...check it like this.

149
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,769
Y-

150
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,836
The first letter is Y.

151
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:19,513
Rejected.

152
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,677
Selected!
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

153
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:23,617
Sir!

154
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,520
So you've a hearing problem as well.

155
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,318
Sometimes, sir.

156
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,188
But nothing to worry about, sir.

157
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,227
It's been like this since childhood.

158
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:32,494
Get out!

159
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,389
Get out!

160
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:35,226
Get out!

161
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:36,288
Get out!

162
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:38,129
Out! Out! Out!

163
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:39,431
Out!

164
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:40,826
Out!

165
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:46,435
Sir!

166
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:55,550
Take down my telephone number. Please.

167
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,186
If my country ever needs me..

168
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:02,219
...I'm always at service.

169
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,585
You get exhausted even while talking.

170
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:08,561
You can't walk few steps properly.

171
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,725
You can't see or hear properly.

172
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,531
What good are you to the country?

173
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,401
I think you're angry right now?

174
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:17,734
I'll come later and explain to you.

175
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:19,731
What time do I come, sir?

176
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:21,303
Why you..

177
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,539
Get lost you cripple!

178
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:25,412
Get lost you deaf!

179
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,414
Get lost! Get lost!

180
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:36,654
I still don't understand“

181
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,218
...why you always fail
the police entrance test.

182
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:39,819
Forget it, mom.

183
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:41,761
These policemen are not too smart.

184
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,662
What?

185
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:45,896
See what's written here?
- What?

186
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:50,469
It says here "Terrorists
attack a group of policemen".

187
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:53,233
"12 policemen dead."

188
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,769
"Three of them were new recruits."

189
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:58,909
They were just my age. Did you hear?

190
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:00,678
What if I had died like this?

191
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,218
Then, what about you?

192
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,448
No, mom.
I don't want to make you upset“

193
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,580
...by joining the police.

194
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,349
I would've felt proud,
instead of being upset.

195
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,222
I see.

196
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:11,851
You didn't read this other news.

197
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:13,218
It's written here..

198
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:17,055
"Dacoits shot a police
officer's mother dead."

199
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:18,857
Did you hear?

200
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,527
They shot the mother.

201
00:14:20,592 --> 00:14:22,868
No, mom.
I can't put your life in danger.

202
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,837
I will never join the police force,
that's it.

203
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,133
What did you say?

204
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:29,809
How dare you?
- Mom.

205
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,404
Listen to me, mom.
- Stop. Stop I say.

206
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:32,504
Listen to me..
- Stop.

207
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,176
I'll leach you a lesson“
- I'm going.

208
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,119
I'll show you when you
come back in the evening.

209
00:14:54,726 --> 00:15:00,472
"All I want is you, forever, mom."

210
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:06,141
"I want you to be my earth and sky,
forever, mom."

211
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:16,820
"All I want is you, forever, mom."

212
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:22,592
"I want you to be my earth and sky,
forever, mom."

213
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:27,797
"I know...that Lord
dwells in our heart."

214
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:33,866
"But...my sweet-innocent
mom dwells in my heart."

215
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:39,507
"But...my sweet-innocent
mom dwells in my heart."

216
00:15:51,616 --> 00:15:53,857
"The world's crazy."

217
00:15:54,419 --> 00:16:02,429
"They go to temples and
shrines to cajole the Lord."

218
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:07,827
"My shrine's in my home,
whenever I look at mom."

219
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:19,653
"Whenever I look at mom."

220
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,230
"You're the only one
I pray for forever, mom."

221
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:32,534
"You're the only feeling
I want forever, mom."

222
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,767
Stop. Stop. Stop.

223
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:37,698
Congratulation.

224
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:40,174
This is the reply to the application“

225
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:41,539
“that we sent to
the police department.

226
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,272
Vishwas has been called
to Mumbai for an interview.

227
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:46,774
Mumbai?

228
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:48,513
You just hit the jackpot, Vishu.

229
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,314
What jackpot, Gopi?

230
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,248
Mom's sending me for
the police selection.

231
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,288
I know she is.

232
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:54,789
She always refused earlier.

233
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,223
Now you can go to Mumbai. Be a star.

234
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,624
"Yeah right. Go. Be a star."

235
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,795
As if every director's
waiting for my arrival.

236
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:02,155
Didn't I tell you?

237
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,166
The girl you saved
at the cinema hall..

238
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,202
“Has a distant uncle. Yogi.

239
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:07,702
He's a renowned writer.

240
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,262
He knows every producer/director
in the industry.

241
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:12,330
He will get you a break in acting.

242
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,438
Really?
- Yes.

243
00:17:43,461 --> 00:17:47,773
Traitor,
why did you go meet our enemy“

244
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:49,573
...Jt. Commissioner Khare?

245
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,375
And what did you tell him? Speak up.

246
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:54,881
He was saying, something despicable“

247
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,244
“is about to happen in the city..

248
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:59,652
...by the name of
'Mission White Elephant'.

249
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:02,780
What is that?

250
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:04,558
And“
- And?

251
00:18:05,283 --> 00:18:11,199
He wanted to know when
Napoleon sir is arriving.

252
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,130
RDX.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:18,697
Take him along,
and practise target on him.

254
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,106
Yes, sir.
- No, sir.

255
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,638
Jt. Commissioner Khare“

256
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,251
“has got a whiff of our mission.

257
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,047
And about Napoleon, sir.

258
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,222
Now there will be war.

259
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:45,762
What do I do, Lord?

260
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:47,125
What do I do?

261
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:50,404
After making me blind,
You've turned deaf.

262
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:52,673
I haven't eaten for three days.

263
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:55,804
I don't even have
the money to buy poison.

264
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,605
Now You've to help
me in taking my life.

265
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,548
No, mister. Don't lose hope so soon.

266
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,711
I've some money. Here you go.

267
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,379
Keep it. To buy poison“
- Huh!

268
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:06,820
I mean to buy food.

269
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,260
Did you really think I was blind?

270
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:15,257
Sorry.
- That's okay.

271
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,791
I'm an actor.
And this is my first earning.

272
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:22,229
I am lstiyaq. And you?
- Vishwas.

273
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,271
I'm hereto see Yogi bhai.

274
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:25,030
How did you know I'm
here to become an actor?

275
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,368
People come with the same
dreams to Sapna Guest House.

276
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,810
But do their dreams gel fulfilled?

277
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:30,845
Will I get a role?

278
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:35,606
All one gets are dates,
dates, dates and more dates.

279
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,380
But no roles.

280
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,753
That's Vishwanath.

281
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:39,814
He's rehearsing.

282
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:41,256
Tomorrow's his date.

283
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:42,580
I mean audition.

284
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:45,419
Who is he, lstiyaq?
- He's one of us.

285
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,058
I see. Another aspiring actor.

286
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,361
Vishwas.

287
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,295
Vishwanath.

288
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:58,168
Guruji.

289
00:19:58,496 --> 00:19:59,566
Guruji.

290
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,079
I think he's sleeping.

291
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:06,378
No, he's thinking.

292
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,215
He's a renowned writer.

293
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:09,512
Let's go.
- Yes.

294
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:11,847
Who is it?

295
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:15,080
Some Vishwas is hereto see you.

296
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,554
Hello, sir.

297
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,226
Vishwas. Come.

298
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,194
Gopi informed me that you're coming.

299
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:26,893
Now that you've come to me“

300
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,831
...you'll definitely be successful.
- Thank you.

301
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:32,738
By the way,
what films have you written?

302
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,582
Have you seen 'Ghajini'?
- I have.

303
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:42,341
'Gadar'?
- I saw it twice, sir.

304
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,644
'Dhoom'?
- 'Dhoom' was a blast. I did.

305
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:48,657
'Wanted?
- I saw it thrice, sir.

306
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:52,326
'Dabbang?
- Of course I watched 'Dabbang'.

307
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:53,794
I watched it umpteen times.

308
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:55,626
Did you write all these films?

309
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:00,302
I almost did.

310
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,196
I had all these ideas.

311
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:07,175
But...someone else made the films.

312
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:10,110
I didn't even write it on paper.

313
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:12,245
I had cooked it up fresh in my mind.

314
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:14,514
Yet they stole it.

315
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,678
That means you never wrote anything.

316
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,381
I will...for you.

317
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:24,152
I can see an actor in your eyes.

318
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:28,587
I can see your future.
You're going to be a superstar.

319
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:32,901
Have you brought a photo?
- Yes, sir. I did.

320
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:34,402
Just a minute.

321
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,266
Here.

322
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:43,278
That's a stamp.
- It's a photo.

323
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:47,614
So small?

324
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:49,874
It will make your future small.
- I see.

325
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:52,916
Big. Bring a bigger photo.

326
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:54,754
And listen.

327
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:56,789
Get me a whiskey...

328
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,825
“while coming back.

329
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,328
Okay?

330
00:22:00,785 --> 00:22:01,695
Listen.

331
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:04,189
Buy a big bottle.

332
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:07,565
Think big,
only then can you make it big.

333
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:14,871
"I've spent so...many
nights with this desire."

334
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:20,541
"I've spent so...many
nights with this desire."

335
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:25,179
"There's so much...that
I want to say."

336
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:29,388
How much?

337
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:31,191
She's here. She's here.

338
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,661
She's here. That girl's here.

339
00:22:33,718 --> 00:22:34,662
Get up everyone. Get back to work.

340
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,459
Get back.

341
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,863
What are you doing, sir?

342
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:38,594
Kajal's here, sir. Get up. Get up.

343
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:39,794
Kajal's here.

344
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:42,337
Borekar, don't bore me..

345
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:43,531
Complaint Kajal, sir.

346
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:45,437
I think she's got a new complaint.

347
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:46,600
Come on.

348
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:49,169
Where's inspector Ghorpade?

349
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:51,273
Come, sir.

350
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:52,905
Some boys are causing
vandalism outside City Mall.

351
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,449
Come right now and arrest them.

352
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:55,745
I can't come now.

353
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:57,717
Register your complaint
like you always do.

354
00:22:57,775 --> 00:22:58,685
And then I'll take action.

355
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:00,313
Don't you see I am busy?

356
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,755
Yes, I can see how busy you are.

357
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:03,155
First learn to hold
the FIR book correctly.

358
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:04,215
And come with me.

359
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:06,558
Otherwise I'll complain to the ACP.

360
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:07,823
Additional Commissioner.

361
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,860

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,691
Sir, better hurry up.

365
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,169
The speed at which she's going..

366
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:17,433
“She'll definitely
gel to the CM or PM.

367
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:18,269
So what have you decided?

368
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,172
What have we decided?
- We'll arrest them.

369
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:21,175
And we'll do it now.

370
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:23,373
Boys.
- Yes, sir!

371
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:25,744
We've to arrest some
hooligans outside City Mall.

372
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,706
Follow me.
- Sir.

373
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,844
Do you recognise all of them?

374
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,347
One of them is the Counselloﬂs son.

375
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,285
Ashok Pure.

376
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:33,378
Ashok“

377
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:34,883
Well, let's see.

378
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,420
And the other is MLA
Gulab Thakur's nephew.

379
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:38,585
Lal Thakur.

380
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:40,218
Him too?

381
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:41,228
We'll try.

382
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:42,889
And Gudappa Das' brother-in-law.

383
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,524
Dharam Prakash. DP.

384
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:45,856
Then I'll have to think about it.

385
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:46,897
What did you say?

386
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,494
Borekar.
- Yes, sir.

387
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,335
The goons have threatened
to kill your father today, right?

388
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:53,432
Sir, my father's already..
- Your father“

389
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:55,170
“that lives in the room above.

390
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,645
Try to understand, Borekar?
- Yes. Yes.

391
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,842
We'll deal with those goons later.

392
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:03,511
First we need to
save Borekar's father.

393
00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:05,178
Boys.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,085
Follow me.

395
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,589
Let's go, sir.

396
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:10,824
I get it, Inspector.

397
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,427
You're evading your duty.

398
00:24:12,516 --> 00:24:14,689
But there must be one
brave inspector in the city.

399
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:15,761
I am there.

400
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:18,466
I'm shooting.

401
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:23,772
The law has long arms.

402
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:29,502
That wasn't a pose.

403
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,514
Yes, mom.
- Son. How are you?

404
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:34,641
Absolutely fine, mom.

405
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:37,350
What's the progress on
your admission in the police

406
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:39,718
Yes...yes, mom.
I'm preparing for that.

407
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,257
Good. Good.
Give me the good news, soon.

408
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:44,190
Of course I will, mom.

409
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:45,852
And look after yourself.

410
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:49,295
And keep calling...whenever
you get the time.

411
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:51,458
Good thing we got pictures
of you in two getups.

412
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:52,728
Yes, that's great.

413
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,569
Where are my clothes?

414
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:57,601
Where could they go?

415
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,573
Were you wearing clothes
when you came in?

416
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:01,268
You think I came in nude?

417
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:03,835
Don't get angry,
you will get your clothes back.

418
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:06,279
Wear this. This is the new
'Kathiawadi' (traditional) dress.

419
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:07,247
It'll look nice on you.

420
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,683
If I wear this outside,
people will think I'm crazy.

421
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,276
Then wear what you're wearing now.

422
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:12,753
People will salute you.

423
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,847
You want my scooter
for few days, right?

424
00:25:14,912 --> 00:25:15,583
Take it.

425
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:27,198
Let's go, quickly.
- Who are you?

426
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:29,704
Follow that black car.
- But I..

427
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,330
Stop talking, let's go.

428
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:33,204
A girl's being abducted
in that black car.

429
00:25:33,264 --> 00:25:34,334
You don't understand.

430
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:35,672
This is no time to talk, Inspector.

431
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,542
It's time for action.
Let's go, quickly.

432
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,739
Help!

433
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,580
That car's speeding away, hurry up.

434
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,348
Look, you're mistaken“
- No, I'm not.

435
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:48,720
I heard it myself.
The girl was yelling, "Help! Help!"

436
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:50,258
It means the girl's in danger.

437
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:51,349
Drive faster.

438
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,292
There is the car.

439
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:55,460
Help!
- Keep quite.

440
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,862
Somebody help me.

441
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,764
There's a police inspector
following us, sir.

442
00:25:58,823 --> 00:25:59,824
What nonsense!

443
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,301
Inspector Ghorpade said“

444
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,635
...there won't be any policeman there.

445
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:05,505
Okay. Calm down. Calm down.

446
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,407
I know, show my photo
to the inspector.

447
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:13,513
How dare he?

448
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,845
He's showing you his boss' photo.

449
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,209
He's mocking you.

450
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:18,318
We will catch them now.

451
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,356
We won't spare them.
Driver faster. Faster.

452
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:26,360
Why are you taking wrong way,
Inspector?

453
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,358
He changed route seeing your photo.

454
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,790
Very good. Very good.

455
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:33,360
Sir, the girl's going that
way and you're going this“

456
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:35,597
What kind of an inspector are you?
- I'm no inspector.

457
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:37,229
There goes the real inspector.

458
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:38,705
Lion-heart inspector.

459
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,141
Who?
- Inspector Chulbul Pandeyl

460
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:43,701
Robinhood Salman Khan!

461
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:47,472
Sir, there's a policeman following us.

462
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:49,484
Police? What now?

463
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:51,412
Did you jump a signal?
- No, sir.

464
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:52,852
PUC? - It's there.
Insurance? - It's there.

465
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,888
License?
- It's there.

466
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:54,888
Do you want me to speed up?

467
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:56,481
Do you wish to take me to the moon?

468
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:59,619
'Wanted',
'Baht-pang', 'Ready', 'Ek Tha Tiger'.

469
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:00,822
What a body.

470
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,091
Fantastic fighter.

471
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,825
<i>Emu anaiq</i>

472
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,800
Sir..

473
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:09,098
<i>Kauai“</i>

474
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,299
What happened, sir?

475
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:18,745
I'm a big fan.
- I see. Thank you.

476
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,477
Can I get an autograph?
- Of course.

477
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,847
Hey, hold on to this.

478
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:27,620
Careful.

479
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:31,618
Your name?
- Vishwas.

480
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,356
Her name?

481
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:39,095
Her name?
- Don't know.

482
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,499
Kajal.

483
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,561
Kajal.

484
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:47,102
Very nice. To Vishwas and Kajal.

485
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:48,775
Here.
- Thank you, bhai.

486
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,868
Thank you.
- Welcome.

487
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,511
Someday I will be like you.
- Of course.

488
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,141
Of course, you sure can.
- Bye.

489
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,753
Why would he become like me?

490
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,352
I pose as inspector in films.

491
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:06,022
And this inspector
wants to be a movie star.

492
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,798
Anyone can be a hero these days.

493
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:11,292
He can too.

494
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,669
Listen, take me to
Rajkumar Santoshfs office.

495
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,301
The narration of 'Andaz
Apna Apna-2' is in progress.

496
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:22,140
Oh no!

497
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,437
Aamir again.

498
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,778
He looks more handsome in real life.

499
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:32,652
The black car's heading this way.

500
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:37,759
That inspector turned
out to be really smart, sir.

501
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:40,387
He took a short-cut and cut us off.

502
00:28:40,451 --> 00:28:42,863
What? What are you
still thinking about?

503
00:28:43,153 --> 00:28:44,257
Get out of there.

504
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:48,798
Forget the girl.
Take the photo and make a run for it.

505
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:52,272
You goons. Where are you going?
- Run. Run. Run.

506
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:54,275
Sir, we scared them off.

507
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,647
Thank you, sister. You saved me.

508
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:01,148
Not me, he did.

509
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,214
Thank him. He saved you.

510
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,613
Thank you officer, for saving me.

511
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:06,820
I am Suman Thappa.

512
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:09,250
Chief Security Officer
Bhimsingh Thappa's daughter.

513
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:11,024
Sister, please give me your phone.

514
00:29:11,815 --> 00:29:12,725
Thank you.

515
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:15,687
Sir, forgive me.

516
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:18,165
I misunderstood you.
- You still misunderstand me..

517
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:20,498
No, no, now I know you very well.

518
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,798
Salman Khan was just an excuse.

519
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:24,504
Actually, you wanted to take
a short-cut and cut them off. Right?

520
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:27,803
You're the first brave and honest
officer I've come across in the city.

521
00:29:28,198 --> 00:29:29,506
I'm really impressed.

522
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:30,541
Sir!

<i>K$peak nth'</i>

524
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:43,785
How much more money do you want?

525
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:47,661
Like I said I don't know
that inspector“ - Don't lie to me.

526
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:54,158
There was a time,
when police officers were honest.

527
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,498
They had character.

528
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:58,839
We would grease their palms“

529
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:01,435
“and they would give us protection.

530
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:05,373
And todaymeven after paying money“

531
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,683
“we can't commit a
small abduction in the city?

532
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,219
I'll talk to the department.

533
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:13,448
No need to talk.

534
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,717
Just give me the
name of that inspector.

535
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,188
I really don't know who he is, sir.

536
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:19,784

You won't make this mistake again.

539
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:26,631
Yes, sir,

540
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,696
Sir...

541
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:34,733
...maybe that inspector's
one of Chinappa Das' man.

542
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:36,376
Right.

543
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:37,878
You're right, Ghorpade.

544

Thank you, sir.
- Biscuit.

00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:47,216
So you are wearing Vishwas' clothes.

546
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:49,787
If you keep this up,
someday you'll be defamed.

547
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,684
"Munni was defamed,
darling only for you."

548
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:55,288
I'm from the Daily Paper.

549
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,429
Mr. Lalwani was supposed
to give me a photograph.

550
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,866
Daddy, someone's here
from the Daily Paper.

551
00:30:59,923 --> 00:31:01,869
Yes. Give him the inspector's photo.

552
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,666
It's kept ready on the table.
- Ready?

553
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:16,443
Stop, sister. Stop.

554
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:17,812
Good news.

00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,219
Vishwas has become
a police inspector. - What?

556
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:22,257
Look, his photo's been
published in the papers.

557
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,893
What's written in it?
- I don't know.

558
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:26,183
The paper's torn.

559
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,389
I got my hands on it in the temple.

560
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,696
Hail Goddess Durgal
- Yes, Lord.

561
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,794

00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,830
My son's become a police inspector.

569
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:50,646
Shout "Police", they will nab him.

“and you will be a movie star.

Movie star?

575
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:00,654
Like this?

576
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,129
Police!

577
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:07,226
You're fantastic, sir.

578
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:10,470
No, no, it was a mistake“
- No, mistake.

579
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:12,165
Throwing that peel was just an excuse.

580
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:15,210
You wanted to catch the
thief without laying a finger.

581
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,474
He's a police officer.

582
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:18,774
Honest. Brave.

583
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:19,712
Thank you, Officer.

584
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,376
This Gundappa Das' thug
was fleeing with my diamonds.

585
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:25,477
Which station should Hake him to?
- Take him to anyone.

586
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:26,850
Heard that. Take him away.

587
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,485
Come on! Come.

588
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:29,780
Fantastic, sir.

00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:32,388
You're always at the crime-scene.

590
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:34,258
But you arrive before me.

591
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,800

She looks like a heroine.
- Yes, she does.

594

But she can't be yours.
- Why?

She's a Mumbai girl.

596
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:56,375
She'll giggle while talking.

597
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,748

Touch sir's feet.

674

Give me one chance.
- What's this, Yogi?

Just give him one chance, just once.

He's a good actor. He'll do good.

682
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,115
This role won't suit him.

I will act well.

687

Look, this role is of a bad character.

688
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:18,366
You look more like a good character.

689
00:38:18,628 --> 00:38:21,302
You can't do it. Okay.

690
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:23,403

00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,317
You will. You will.

What are these?

699
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:48,135
Eyes, sir.

700
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:49,636
They are cameras.

701
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,300
I can tell what one can, or cannot do.

702
00:38:52,362 --> 00:38:53,636
You cannot do it.

703
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:56,200
Go. Get out!
- No, sir..

Move back! Back!

713
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,527
You were wrong.

714
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:26,230
You shouldn't have insulted my mother.

715
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:29,170
She's a mother after all..
- Stop this“

716

00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,748
He didn't come hereto beg you.

719
00:39:36,473 --> 00:39:38,180
I wanted to become an actor.

720
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:40,811
It was my childhood dream.

721
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,585
I thought I would come to Mumbai,
work hard“

722
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:46,352
Carve a niche for myself.

723
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:47,417
But this stupid“.

724
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:49,259
“Is in a hurry to
get her out of the pool.

725
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:50,764
That's why he's throwing us out!

726
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:56,062
Let's go, Vishwas, he..
- What did I say to him?

727
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:59,473
I said "Give me a chance.
Give me a chance to act".

728
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:00,701
He says, "These are.."

729
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:06,409
<i>plasma-l</i>

730
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:07,539
What did you say?

731
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:10,450
What are these?

732
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:12,818
What are these?

733
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:13,820
What are these?

734
00:40:14,277 --> 00:40:17,884
Eyes.
- No. Camera.

735
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:20,684
Yes. Camera.

736
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:24,230
You can see everything.

737
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,329
so...what am I going to do?
- What?

738
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:30,132
Say it, otherwise your camera“

739
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,336
Sir, is this bad enough?

740
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,578
What?
- You said it's a bad character.

741
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:39,870
Acting?
- Yes, sir.

742
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:41,245
Good.

743
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:44,619
I can be worse, sir.
- No, no. Good.

744
00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:46,620
Bad. Good. Bad.

745
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:47,654
Good“

746
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,521
Very good. Very good.

747
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,490
Selected.

748
00:40:52,282 --> 00:40:53,488
Great, sir.

749
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,791
What happened?
- He got the role.

750
00:40:57,854 --> 00:40:59,356
He's a star now. Star.

751
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:01,061
The phone's ringing.

752
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:03,201
It's ringing. Answer it.

753
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,538
Yes, mom. How are you?

754
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:10,100
I never thought you'll do this to me.

755
00:41:11,534 --> 00:41:13,070
I know everything.

756
00:41:13,937 --> 00:41:15,439
Sorry, mom, I..
- Be quiet.

757
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,614
You got selected as a police
officer and didn't tell me.

758
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,856
Police officer?
- Enough.

759
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:24,482
Stop with your charades.

760
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:26,891
I saw your photo in the paper.

761
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,861
In the police uniform.
- Photo?

762
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:30,524
Police?

763
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:32,328
I am coming to Mumbai
day-after-tomorrow.

764
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,732
For three days.
- What?

765
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:36,704
I've a desire to see
you in the police uniform.

766
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:38,702
To see you doing your duty.

767
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,799
My train will arrive at 3 o'clock.
Pick me up from the station.

768
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:46,404
No, Guru. I can't do it.

769
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,807
I've already lied to mother before.

770
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:50,317
I've hurt her once.

771
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:52,143
I can't hurt her anymore.

772
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:54,149
You've great sentiments.

773
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:55,885
Tomorrow when she finds out that“

774
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:58,819
...you're preparing to be an actor,
not a police officer..

775
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:00,691
“Do you think it'll make her happy?

776
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,854
What do I do, Guru?

777
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:03,822
What do I do?
- Just do as I said.

778
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:05,525
Just pose as a police inspector“

779
00:42:05,588 --> 00:42:07,226
...in front of your mother, that's it.

780
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:10,234
Just like Sanjay Dutt posed
as a doctor in 'Munnabhai'?

781
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:13,604
Exactly, son. Same to same.

782
00:42:14,197 --> 00:42:15,540
Mom's coming home for three days.

783
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:18,841
We'll borrow a house, jeep
and a police uniform for few days.

784
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:22,509
You just have to pretend
that you're a police inspector.

785
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:24,779
Guru, this will give us
a chance to act as well. - Right.

786
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:27,412
We'll act really well, Guru.
- Right.

787
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:29,650
And I'll do the best
acting of my life.

788
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,784
See. Everything's very good.

789
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,458
No. Don't touch my feet
while you're still in uniform.

790
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:04,548
Respect it.

791
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:05,524
Give it to me.

792
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:09,591
What happened, mom?
- Nothing.

793
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:10,824
Nothing.

794
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:13,659
How are you?
- I'm fine.

795
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:15,100
How are you?
- Me?

796
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,437
Inspector Vishwas Rao.
- Hello, Father Anthony Gonzalez.

797
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,705
God bless you, my child.
God bless you.

798
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,872
You did a splendid
job by closing down..

799
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,217
“The bars and gambling
dens in our area.

800
00:43:29,272 --> 00:43:30,774
That's my duty, Father.

801
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:35,454
I'm so proud of you, my child!

802
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:40,894
A honest, loyal, capable,
talented police officer like you..

803
00:43:41,351 --> 00:43:43,456
“Can't be in our area.

804
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:49,904
Inspector Vishwas. I would
like to...meet your mom, just once.

805
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:51,531
She's my mom, Father.

806
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,875
I am so lucky to be meeting you.

807
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,907
How many sons do you have?

808
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:00,837
I have just one son.

809
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,845
How sad. How very sad.

810
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,711
Why didn't you have
some more children? - What?

811
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:08,119
It would've been in
the interest of the country.

812
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,852
You're just great to give
birth to an officer like him.

813
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:12,692
Bless me, O mother!

814
00:44:13,249 --> 00:44:15,354
He's taking her blessings.

815
00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:18,732
Bless me so that next
time I can be your son..

816
00:44:18,788 --> 00:44:20,290
“And a brave officer like him.

817
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:21,767
Make my country proud. Make the police
department proud. - Excuse me, lady.

818
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,601
Is that your bag?
The red and yellow. - No, no.

819
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:25,639
Okay, thank you.

820
00:44:27,897 --> 00:44:31,868
Son, where's the priest?
- Mom. It was time for his prayers.

821
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:34,638
Go on, son.

822
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:37,376
Don't disgrace your Guru.

823
00:44:41,277 --> 00:44:42,779
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

824
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:46,692
Sir. Is she your mother?
- Yes. She is.

825
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,821
Hello, madam.

826
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:52,095
I want to be honest with you.

827
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:53,899
Your son“
- Yes.

828
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,296
Your son...isn't a police officer.
- What?

829
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,403
He's not a police officer.
- What are you saying?

830
00:44:59,462 --> 00:45:00,406
He's God.

831
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:02,743
God, dressed in a uniform.

832
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:08,741
You risked your life alone,
lo protect us helpless..

833
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:11,618
“And drove out 50 goons.

834
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,288
And you thrashed them so hard that.

835
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:16,119
How?

836
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,658
He thrashes them so hard“

837
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,625
...the other goons fled for
their lives hearing them scream.

838
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,354
You are...the protector of the poor.

839
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:26,529
You...are just!

840
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:29,768
You are...the pride of our country.

841
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,671
"May our flag always soar high."

842
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:37,806
"The pride and glory of our country."

843
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:41,144
"May our flag always soar high."

844
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:43,684
Before he goes up the
Red Fort with the flag“

845
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:44,775
Bring him down?
- Hmmm.

846
00:45:44,841 --> 00:45:45,876
Coolie.
- Yes.

847
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:49,685
O Inspector.
I'll build a shrine for you.

848
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:52,352
Aunt. I'll keep you there too.

849
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:53,189
What?

850
00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:55,593
And...worship you both“

851
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:02,333
Aunt, are those black
and yellow bags yours? - No.

852
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:03,496
Sorry.

853
00:46:03,826 --> 00:46:05,567
Where is he?

854
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:07,733
Mom, it was time for him to pray.

855
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:08,832
Come, mom.

856
00:46:14,337 --> 00:46:16,180
One minutes.

857
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:18,615
Do fast.

858
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,621
Some on help.

859
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,057
What's going on?

860
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:26,190
Where, mom?

861
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:29,460
Look. Some goons are beating them up.

862
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:31,830
Where, mom?

863
00:46:33,256 --> 00:46:35,099
Not there, here.

864
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:40,298
Save me, Inspector.
- Sir. Sir.

865
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:41,735
They are calling you.
- No, no.

866
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,438
Mom...they aren't calling me,
but their area's inspector.

867
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,138
Mister, hurry up.
- Done, sir.

868
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:48,409
Go take a look.
- I can't go, mom.

869
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:49,677
This isn't my area.

870
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:52,776
Hurry up. - You mind your area,
and I'll deal with them.

871
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:53,752
Mom.

872
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,652
Mom.

873
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:55,855
Mom.

874
00:46:57,413 --> 00:46:58,255
Move back.

875
00:46:58,581 --> 00:46:59,423
Stop.

876
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:00,392
Who are you, woman?

877
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,355
I'm the inspector's mother.

878
00:47:03,419 --> 00:47:04,727
Mom, what are you doing? Let's go.

879
00:47:04,787 --> 00:47:07,233
Inspector. Are you new in the area?

880
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,133
What would you do if he was old?

881
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:10,193
Mom, wait.

882
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:13,536
Inspector, we've been running
this school for 60 years.

883
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:17,243
And now Gudappa Das'
henchmen want to force us out.

884
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,644
They want to build a dance bar here.

885
00:47:20,303 --> 00:47:21,805
Are you done? You heard enough?

886
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,778
Once the bar opens you
can come have free food.

887
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,841
Get going-

888
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:27,251
Vishwas. What's he saying?
- Yes“

889
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,483
How dare you scold
me in front of my mother?

890
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:33,118
Not just that,
he's scolding you, a police officer.

891
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:36,595
Yes, mom. I'm a police inspector.

892
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:37,688
What's your name?

893
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:41,293
Stupid. Insects like you..

894
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:44,531
...know me for my fist, not my name.

895
00:47:49,832 --> 00:47:51,709
Good one, mom?
- First class.

896
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:59,813
Stop that and thrash him.
- I will.

897
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:01,654
What did you say?
- Get lost!

898
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:02,485
Get lost!

899
00:50:23,152 --> 00:50:24,290
This is our house, mom.

900
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:25,832
Isn't it first class?

901
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:30,569
Wow! You've such a big house.

902
00:50:30,626 --> 00:50:33,232
No, mom. Not the one downstairs.
That's closed.

903
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:34,832
We've just rented the top floor.

904
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:37,703
Rented?
- No, aunt. Let me tell you.

905
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:41,442
Sir means the government
has rented out the room to him.

906
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:43,745
Do you get it?
Because they're happy with his work.

907
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:46,878
Of course.
My son's done such a good job.

908
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,923
The government's got to be pleased.

909
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:51,716
Very good. Very, very, good.

910
00:50:52,782 --> 00:50:54,386
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

911
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:57,890
Which new officer did you
train in your police station“

912
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:00,460
“that's doing such
a great job in your area?

913
00:51:01,123 --> 00:51:03,660
The other day he saved
a girl from abduction.

914
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:06,498
Then he apprehended the thief.

915
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,776
And today he thrashed
Gundappa's goons.

916
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:10,867
Single-handedly.

917
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:12,538
I am impressed.

918
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:16,743
Sir, I..
- Of course.

919
00:51:16,806 --> 00:51:19,252
I will put in a recommendation
for your promotion.

920
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:20,779
<i>L am very hﬂPPY-</i>

921
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:23,881
Sir, he really“
- You really have done a good job.

922
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,688
I will put in a
recommendation for your..

923
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,562
Borekar. What's this?

924
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:32,833
You had moustaches, didn't you?

925
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,493
I still do, sir.

926
00:51:39,428 --> 00:51:41,374
Well. Gentlemen.

927
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:44,434
There's bad news.

928
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:47,673
Napoleon's coming to Mumbai.

929
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:52,886
Interpol's sent us some
photographs of Napoleon.

930
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,483
Take a close look at these photos“

931
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:57,619
“and recognise him well.

932
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,323
Did you get a good look?

933
00:52:08,424 --> 00:52:09,232
Good!

934
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,465
Smuggling. Drugs. Terrorism.

935
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:14,640
Napoleon takes
contracts for all these.

936
00:52:14,897 --> 00:52:17,173
According to the information
received from RAW..

937
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:18,837
“He's coming to Mumbai soon.

938
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:21,581
To execute a dangerous mission.

939
00:52:21,637 --> 00:52:25,175
And his mission's called
'Mission While Elephant'.

940
00:52:25,841 --> 00:52:30,256
We've to thwart 'Mission
White Elephant' at any cost.

941
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,486
And we've to catch Napoleon alive..

942
00:52:32,748 --> 00:52:35,228
“And make Mumbai police proud.

943
00:52:35,651 --> 00:52:36,493
And“

944
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:40,394
Let's catch him first.

945
00:52:42,491 --> 00:52:45,734
Guru. How did you like mom's cooking?
- Fantastic.

946
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:47,866
I say let's gel some
for dinner as well.

947
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:48,874
Hot vegetables.

948
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:51,872
I'm eating your cooked
food after so long.

949
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,272
Feels so nice.

950
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,440
But, mom.
It would've been so much better“

951
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:55,777
...if you could stay for few more days.

952
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,515
Why did you come for just three days?

953
00:52:57,573 --> 00:52:59,814
Yes, son.
I was thinking the same thing.

954
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:05,187
Water.

955
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:07,591
But, mom. How can you stay back here?

956
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,687
You've things to do
back in the village. - Yes.

957
00:53:09,752 --> 00:53:10,730
No, son.

958
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:12,163
When you're insisting“

959
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:13,757
“then I'll stay
a few months with you.

960
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:17,464
Yes, yes. Of course.

961
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,737
But“
- Mind your duty, sir.

962
00:53:19,795 --> 00:53:20,830
How can you stay back?

963
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,770
Three days later you've to
leave with the CM for three months.

964
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,143
For security reasons.
- Yes.

965
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:29,648
No. I'll refuse the CM.

966
00:53:29,905 --> 00:53:32,886
I'll tell him, "My mom's arrived from
the village, so I'm slaying with her".

967
00:53:33,175 --> 00:53:37,089
Right, mom.
- Duty comes first, mother later.

968
00:53:37,413 --> 00:53:39,450
Don't worry about me.
I'll come visit you again.

969
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,794
She's saying she'll
come visit you again.

970
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:52,467
Good morning, sir.. Evening?

971
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:54,371
Afternoon, sir.
- You called?

972
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,910
You sent that inspector again,
Ghorpade“

973
00:53:56,966 --> 00:53:59,446
“to beat-up my men.

974
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,606
Sir, I've told you before.

975
00:54:00,669 --> 00:54:03,809
He's not one of us“
- Lying again.

976
00:54:04,106 --> 00:54:06,848
Why don't you just say
how much money do you want?

977
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,417
I don't want money, sir?
- So?

978
00:54:08,677 --> 00:54:10,179
Do you want property this time?

979
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,624
No, sir. I mean...l don't
know who the inspector is.

980
00:54:12,681 --> 00:54:15,252
Sir, that inspector
thrashed us really bad.

981
00:54:15,317 --> 00:54:16,523
He jumped kicked us.

982
00:54:16,585 --> 00:54:18,258
He made us run for our lives, sir.

983
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,163
Look. He thrashed them so badly.

984
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:24,432
He beat Madan black and blue.
- Sir, I'm Mohan.

985
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:26,536
He's beat them up so badly.

986
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:29,838
You can't make out who's Madan,
who's Mohan.

987
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,537
We're going back to our village, sir.

988
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,670
See, Ghorpade.

989
00:54:32,735 --> 00:54:33,873
Half of them are heading
back to their village“

990
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,478
“and the other half
are in the hospital.

991
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,540
Mission White Elephant
is in its final stages.

992
00:54:37,606 --> 00:54:41,281
Sir.. - Either you drag
him here by his foot or his hair..

993
00:54:41,343 --> 00:54:47,294
“But bring him to me,
or else I'll skin you alive.

994
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:49,862
What?

995
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:52,331
Director Anees Bazmi's
given an appointment?

996
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:55,335
<i>Yes, knees Bazmi.
- Green, Guru.</i>

997
00:54:55,391 --> 00:54:56,734
I'll be right there.

998
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:59,568
Just don't let Anees leave.
- Who is Anees?

999
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,310
Anees is a very big movie“
- Movie?

1000
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:04,736
Don.

1001
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:06,472
He's a don.

1002
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:07,843
Just like there are
dangerous villains in films..

1003
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:09,775
“Similarly, they are real life dons.

1004
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:11,479
We finally managed
to get a grip on them.

1005
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,650
I mean, find them.

1006
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:15,154
So...I'll go make a plan to catch him.
Give me your blessings.

1007
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,794
No need to worry.
I've found out everything.

1008
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,738
Joint commissioner Khare's
home is undergoing repairs.

1009
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:36,572
So he's rented the ground floor
of your home for a month. That's it.

1010
00:55:36,632 --> 00:55:40,205
Guru. If that joint commissioner
sees me in uniform..

1011
00:55:40,269 --> 00:55:41,680
“He'll throw me in jail.

1012
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:42,875
That won't happen.

1013
00:55:42,938 --> 00:55:44,815
Just do as you were
doing until now. Acting..

1014
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,217
Silence.

1015
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:51,256
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1016
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,327
My son's a police inspector too.

1017
00:55:54,383 --> 00:55:56,590
We live on the upper floor.
- I see.

1018
00:55:56,852 --> 00:55:58,763
Yes. He just joined the police force.

1019
00:55:59,421 --> 00:56:02,459
He's closed down many bars
and gambling dens. - I see.

1020
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,498
And he beat up some
criminals so badly“

1021
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:09,065
...that the other goons fled
the city hearing their screams.

1022
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:11,840
What's his name?

1023
00:56:12,868 --> 00:56:14,370
Vishwas Rao.

1024
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:19,074
He's after some Don.. Yes.

1025
00:56:19,408 --> 00:56:22,821
He's planning to apprehend
some don called Anees.

1026
00:56:22,878 --> 00:56:23,754
Anees?

1027
00:56:23,812 --> 00:56:25,723
Anees Ismail? That dangerous don.

1028
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:27,556
He's planning to catch him.

1029
00:56:27,616 --> 00:56:29,220
Then I would like
to meet him right now.

1030
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:30,059
What?
- Yes.

1031
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:39,462
You're laughing.

1032
00:56:39,528 --> 00:56:41,405
The commissioner's waiting
for you downstairs“

1033
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:45,539
Mom, you got fooled too.

1034
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:46,705
You're so innocent.

1035
00:56:47,269 --> 00:56:48,805
He's no police commissioner.

1036
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:50,512
He's not the commissioner.

1037
00:56:50,906 --> 00:56:53,409
He's an actor.
- Actor?

1038
00:56:53,475 --> 00:56:56,081
He used to work as a
commissioner in TV serials.

1039
00:56:56,478 --> 00:56:58,651
One day he suddenly
stopped getting work..

1040
00:56:58,714 --> 00:56:59,818
“And lost his mind.

1041
00:57:00,282 --> 00:57:01,784
Then?
- He went mad.

1042
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,191
He dons the police uniform
and sets out on the road.

1043
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:07,598
He goes and sits in any
police station that he sees.

1044
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:10,535
Oh Lord!
- Lord, have mercy on him.

1045
00:57:10,893 --> 00:57:13,430
And he's been kept here
for treatment. - I see.

1046
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:17,341
And those people around him,
in uniform, are crazy. - What?

1047
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:18,838
I mean they're actors.

1048
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:21,341
They're acting so that
he feels he's the commissioner.

1049
00:57:21,403 --> 00:57:23,110
But why?
- Because the doctor's said“

1050
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:24,651
...this is the only way to treat him.

1051
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:29,679
And the doctor's also said
keep his illusion intact. - Why?

1052
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:33,557
Because if his illusion shatters,
then he can lose his life.

1053
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,687
Heart-fail.

1054
00:57:37,586 --> 00:57:38,428
Son“

1055
00:57:39,188 --> 00:57:41,361
Son, we won't shatter
his illusion either.

1056
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,269
You've got to act
in front of him as well.

1057
00:57:43,325 --> 00:57:46,704
Mom. You know I can't act.

1058
00:57:47,129 --> 00:57:50,167
Try.
- Okay, mom. I will.

1059
00:57:50,432 --> 00:57:51,308
Only for you.

1060
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,809
My mom's“

1061
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:01,184
What?

1062
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,386
That's why I..

1063
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:08,752
Look, first speak then cry.

1064
00:58:08,817 --> 00:58:10,421
Or first cry then speak.

1065
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:11,829
Don't speak and cry together,
Inspector.

1066
00:58:12,187 --> 00:58:14,258
I am not an inspector.
- What?

1067
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,097
And this uniform?
- It's rented.

1068
00:58:17,459 --> 00:58:19,803
I've worn it to keep my mother alive.

1069
00:58:20,462 --> 00:58:23,306
What's this story?
- It's a sad story.

1070
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:32,517
My mother loved watching films.

1071
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:34,650
One day she went to watch a film.

1072
00:58:35,277 --> 00:58:38,315
The story of an honest
officer and his mother.

1073
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,452
Suddenly, the fan above
fell on my mother's head.

1074
00:58:41,517 --> 00:58:43,053
Oh, my God! Then what?

1075
00:58:43,352 --> 00:58:45,855
The fan stopped,
but my mother lost her mind.

1076
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,362
Oh no.
- Oh yes.

1077
00:58:49,191 --> 00:58:51,535
Since then she thinks
I'm a police officer.

1078
00:58:51,593 --> 00:58:53,834
And I wear this uniform
in front of her.

1079
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,268
But what do the doctors say?

1080
00:58:56,598 --> 00:58:59,238
They say this is the
only way to treat her.

1081
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:02,775
Keep her illusion intact.
- Why?

1082
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:04,715
Because if I take off my uniform..

1083
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:07,053
...then my mother will lose her life.

1084
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:10,055
No, no. Keep this uniform on.

1085
00:59:10,779 --> 00:59:12,725
We'll keep your mother's
illusion intact, Vishwas.

1086
00:59:14,616 --> 00:59:16,425
Inspector Vishwas.

1087
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,632
Mr. Commissioner, she's my mother.

1088
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:26,638
Yes, we've met before.

1089
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:28,436
Mom, he's the Commissioner.

1090
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:31,141
My son really praises you.

1091
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:33,811
He says you're a big television“
- Mom..

1092
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:34,808
Television?

1093
00:59:35,571 --> 00:59:37,812
I mean, there's no other police
officer like you in this city.

1094
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:39,245
Yes.

1095
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:42,585
And I say, your son acts so well“

1096
00:59:42,644 --> 00:59:43,588
Sir..

1097
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:47,559
Act?
- I meant active.

1098
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:51,198
He's the most active inspector
in our entire department.

1099
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,824
Right, Vishwas?

1100
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:54,801
Inspector Vishwas.

1101
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,497
Mr. Commissioner,
do look after yourself.

1102
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:00,096
You shouldn't go out on the
streets wearing this uniform.. - Mom.

1103
01:00:00,462 --> 01:00:01,372
Alone on the streets?

1104
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:04,640
I mean, you should keep
your constables with you. - Yes.

1105
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:07,375
And you should watch fewer films.
- Sir.

1106
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:10,407
I don't watch films.

1107
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:14,211
I do. I watch lots of films.

1108
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:17,322
Just a minute, madam.
Just come with me. - Yes.

1109
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:22,425
Vishwas, what is she saying?

1110
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,857
Television serial?
Don't roam the streets? I'm confused.

1111
01:00:25,921 --> 01:00:29,664
There's no confusion. It's simple.

1112
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:32,297
Really? - You're not
the joint commissioner.

1113
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:34,102
What?
- For my mother.

1114
01:00:34,763 --> 01:00:37,835
But you are, for me.
- Thank God.

1115
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,881
I'm a police inspector.
- But you said you're not.

1116
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,672
For my mom, sir.

1117
01:00:42,738 --> 01:00:44,718
But I'm not, for you.

1118
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:48,917
And“
- I get it. I understand.

1119
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:52,357
I'm the joint commissioner,
but I am not.

1120
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:53,785
In your mom's view.

1121
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:57,458
And you're not a police inspector,
but you are one.

1122
01:00:57,519 --> 01:00:58,793
In your mom's view.

1123
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:00,358
And mother's a mother after all.

1124
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:03,069
But she isn't, in whose view?

1125
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:04,861
A mother's always a mother,
in everyone's view.

1126
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,702
Sir, you're so“
- Yes.

1127
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:08,403
A mother's always a mother.

1128
01:01:13,435 --> 01:01:15,745
There are bigger malls in Mumbai.

1129
01:01:15,804 --> 01:01:17,784
Hello, sir. I was looking for you.

1130
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,242
Sir.

1131
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,150
Hello.

1132
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:22,454
Who is she?

1133
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:23,615
She's my mother.
- What?

1134
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:25,454
Sorry. Are you my mother?

1135
01:01:25,714 --> 01:01:26,692
Vishwas.

1136
01:01:28,684 --> 01:01:31,358
She's my mother.
- Aunt.

1137
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:33,094
Bless you, dear.

1138
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:35,332
Who is she?
- She's a girl.

1139
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,597
I know that, but who is she?

1140
01:01:38,293 --> 01:01:40,364
She's a girl, and“
- Kajal.

1141
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:42,431
She's Kajal, mom.

1142
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:46,105
Whenever anything
bad occurs in the city..

1143
01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:47,574
...you will find her there.

1144
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,872
What?
- Aunt, let me tell you.

1145
01:01:50,272 --> 01:01:51,580
I'm a social worker.

1146
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,551
Whenever I see anything
wrong happening in the city..

1147
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:57,216
...I inform the police.
- Great. You do the right thing.

1148
01:01:57,279 --> 01:01:59,816
And I'm here with a complaint
right now, aunt. For him.

1149
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,624
Sir, Paradise club at Gol Chowki..

1150
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:05,460
“Deal in every kind
of illegal drugs and business.

1151
01:02:05,821 --> 01:02:06,822
I just found out that“

1152
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,495
“some juvenile girls
are being held captive there.

1153
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:10,866
Oh God!
- Yes. Let's go.

1154
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:13,400
Let's go lodge a complaint
with the police. - What?

1155
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:14,805
I'm the police.

1156
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:16,332
I'm the police.

1157
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:19,436
But that isn't my area, Kajal.

1158
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:21,412
So, go lodge a complaint
with the area's inspector.

1159
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:23,472
Go fast. I did go there.
- You did.

1160
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,485
But inspector Ghorpade
isn't ready to listen.

1161
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,418
He isn't?
- No. - Forget the area.

1162
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:29,456
Go, go with her.
And free those girls. Go.

1163
01:02:29,511 --> 01:02:30,888
I can't go, mom.

1164
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:32,249
L..
- Hold this.

1165
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:34,260
Dear, which way?
- Aunt.

1166
01:02:34,316 --> 01:02:36,318
At Gol Chowki, there's a..
- Quiet.

1167
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:37,557
Hold this, mom.

1168
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:39,599
Let's go, mom. Come, Kajal.
- Come.

1169
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,830
100 million in cash.

1170
01:02:46,428 --> 01:02:48,271
Anything special?
- It's very special.

1171
01:02:48,697 --> 01:02:51,268
All this money is for
'Mission White Elephant'.

1172
01:02:52,267 --> 01:02:55,441
Remember.
Gundappa sir has said, "Be careful".

1173
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:56,874
Don't worry.

1174
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,543
This is one of Gundappa
sir's safest places.

1175
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:00,314
No one can come here.
- Good.

1176
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:01,649
Let us go!

1177
01:03:07,115 --> 01:03:08,219
What a club!

1178
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,796
Till now I only saw them in films.

1179
01:03:12,654 --> 01:03:14,395
It's the Abode of Gods!

1180
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:18,303
Rambha. Menka.
Urvashi. They're all here.

1181
01:03:19,828 --> 01:03:24,106
They are not girls,
they're vanilla ice-cream.

1182
01:03:26,134 --> 01:03:29,343
Sir. What are you staring at?

1183
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:32,484
I wasn't staring. I was thinking,
girls like you shouldn't go lo a..

1184
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:35,454
...club like this to see such
cheap dance.

1185
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:36,716
We should leave right now.

1186
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:38,519
Sir, we're not hereto see the dance.

1187
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,854
We're hereto free the girls.

1188
01:03:40,148 --> 01:03:42,628
Inspector!
- Don't you know that“

1189
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:44,163
“the police are not
allowed in this club?

1190
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:45,829
So what are you doing here?

1191
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:50,497
Just taking a stroll around.
Just like that.

1192
01:03:50,792 --> 01:03:52,635
It's nice.
- No, it's not.

1193
01:03:52,694 --> 01:03:53,866
We're hereto conduct a raid.

1194
01:03:53,929 --> 01:03:55,636
I'm a reporter.
And I've information that“

1195
01:03:55,697 --> 01:03:57,802
...you've held some girls captive here.

1196
01:03:57,866 --> 01:04:00,642
Bring them out.
- Hey, girl. What nonsense.

1197
01:04:00,702 --> 01:04:01,840
Calm down, Kajal. Calm down.

1198
01:04:02,137 --> 01:04:04,139
Sir. Are you scared of fighting?

1199
01:04:04,206 --> 01:04:06,447
No, I'm not scared. I enjoy fighting.

1200
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:08,447
You see, Kajal.

1201
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:11,855
If they injure my face
my career will be over forever.

1202
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:13,189
What?

1203
01:04:13,248 --> 01:04:15,319
Let me talk to them.
- You will talk to us?

1204
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:16,590
You will talk to us?

1205
01:04:16,852 --> 01:04:18,058

Baktawar. Kallan.

1208
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:26,867
Why call so many people to talk?

1209
01:04:26,928 --> 01:04:29,431
This is how we talk here.

1210
01:04:30,198 --> 01:04:32,303
Just mind your own business“

1211
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:33,772
...get something to eat and get lost.

1212
01:04:34,169 --> 01:04:36,206
We're hereto teach you a lesson.

1213
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:38,376
This inspector is a
bulldozer without brakes.

1214
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,511
Once he starts he doesn't stop.

1215
01:04:40,575 --> 01:04:42,248
I see.
- Move aside.

1216
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:43,288
Shoot him!

1217
01:04:46,548 --> 01:04:49,119

Come on, get out quickly. Run away!

What's going on here?

1232
01:06:40,295 --> 01:06:41,603
Let's go.

1233
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,173
Attention!

01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:47,270
Officer, attention“

1235
01:06:47,335 --> 01:06:49,281
Ghorpade, we called you long ago.

1236
01:06:49,337 --> 01:06:50,782
Ghorpade sir, this isn't right.

1237
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,341
Why did you take so long to come here?

1238
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:53,385
You have again sent the
same inspector.

1239
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:55,882
No, I mean“ Move on.

1240
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:00,390
Breaking news.

1241
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:03,459
Police conduct a raid
at Gundappa Das' Paradise club.

1242
01:07:03,518 --> 01:07:06,590
On the orders of Gol
Chowki police station's“

1243
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,100
“senior inspector Ghorpade“

1244
01:07:08,156 --> 01:07:09,658
...one of his young officers,
didn't just thrash the goons..

1245
01:07:09,724 --> 01:07:11,670
“But also rescued
some juvenile girls.

1246
01:07:11,726 --> 01:07:13,831
And confiscated millions of rupees.

1247
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:16,333
Ghorpade sir,
what would you like to say?

1248
01:07:16,598 --> 01:07:17,474
Me?

1249
01:07:17,799 --> 01:07:18,777
I am sorry, sir.

1250
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,443
What do I say?

1251
01:07:20,502 --> 01:07:22,448
I don't know who did it.

1252
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:24,415
I just arrived recently.

1253
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:25,747
How much is this?

1254
01:07:25,774 --> 01:07:26,775
Who told you?

1255
01:07:30,512 --> 01:07:31,855
Kajal, what are you doing?

1256
01:07:31,913 --> 01:07:33,392
What if it starts raining?

1257
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,787
The doctor's asked
you to keep the wound dry.

1258
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:37,252
It feels nice.

1259
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,799
Of course, all the girls were rescued.

1260
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:41,334
Except for one.
- What?

1261
01:07:41,623 --> 01:07:43,500
No, they all ran away.

1262
01:07:43,558 --> 01:07:44,593
I saw it myself.

1263
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,733
Why are you laughing?
- Just like that.

1264
01:07:47,796 --> 01:07:49,673
Only crazy people
laugh without a reason.

1265
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:54,310
I can't see a rickshaw around either.

1266
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:56,246
If it starts raining,
we'll be in trouble.

1267
01:07:56,771 --> 01:07:58,773
That'll be even better.

1268
01:07:59,941 --> 01:08:02,387
I don't know,
but everything seems nice.

1269
01:08:02,744 --> 01:08:04,587
I'm injured, but even that feels nice.

1270
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,626
Madam. Did you hit your head?

1271
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,330
Have you lost your mind?

1272
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:18,797
I grew up alone.

1273
01:08:21,329 --> 01:08:25,141
I was very young, when my parents“

1274
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:33,651
And, I never“

1275
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,756
“had a kin.

1276
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,761
Today, for the first time“

1277
01:08:44,853 --> 01:08:49,802
It felt like...I've a kin.

1278
01:08:57,465 --> 01:09:00,173
"You're the dream."

1279
01:09:00,235 --> 01:09:02,476
"I'm the slumber."

1280
01:09:02,737 --> 01:09:08,278
"Together we make up the night."
- I am always with you.

1281
01:09:08,343 --> 01:09:13,343
"Every day I praymlhal
our wishes are fulfilled."

1282
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:22,260
"Our wishes are fulfilled."

1283
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:32,540
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1284
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,773
"And you're the sweet of river."

1285
01:09:35,236 --> 01:09:37,648
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1286
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,811
"And you're the sweet of river."

1287
01:09:40,241 --> 01:09:45,452
"Togethermwe can make up our story."

1288
01:09:45,513 --> 01:09:47,515
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1289
01:09:47,916 --> 01:09:50,226
"And you're the sweet of river."

1290
01:09:50,585 --> 01:09:53,122
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1291
01:09:53,188 --> 01:09:55,759
"And you're the sweet of river."

1292
01:10:01,162 --> 01:10:06,202
"Slowly, calmly,
I've woven your dreams logetheru"

1293
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:10,511
"..with my slumber."

1294
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:16,221
"I don't want the earth,
or the heaven."

1295
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:20,618
"All I want is you in my life."

1296
01:10:21,282 --> 01:10:23,785
"You're the saga of love."

1297
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:26,264
"And I'm naively."

1298
01:10:26,321 --> 01:10:31,634
"Togethermwe can make up our story."

1299
01:10:31,693 --> 01:10:33,832
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1300
01:10:34,162 --> 01:10:36,608
"And you're the sweet of river."

1301
01:10:36,664 --> 01:10:38,905
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1302
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,644
"And you're the sweet of river."

1303
01:10:51,946 --> 01:11:01,355
"Your thoughts are the
only place I want to be."

1304
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:07,264
"You mean everything to me,
always did."

1305
01:11:07,328 --> 01:11:11,674
"The rest of the world
is stranger to me."

1306
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:14,504
"YIN-I'm a traveller "

1307
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:16,879
"I'm an unknown path."

1308
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:19,652
"Take me wherever you liken"

1309
01:11:19,707 --> 01:11:22,551
"..we can make up our story."

1310
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:24,715
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1311
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:27,350
"And you're the sweet of river."

1312
01:11:27,415 --> 01:11:29,827
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1313
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:32,330
"And you're the sweet of river."

1314
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:37,632
"Togethermwe can make up our story."

1315
01:11:37,692 --> 01:11:39,831
"I'm the colour of syrups."

1316
01:11:40,295 --> 01:11:42,866
"And you're the sweet of river."

1317
01:11:46,734 --> 01:11:49,806
The cash that I sent
for 'Mission White Elephant'..

1318
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:51,577
“Was confiscated.

1319
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,647
Why?
- Yes, sir.

1320
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:56,382
There's a police inspector“

1321
01:11:56,744 --> 01:12:01,625
“who, for no reason...always..

1322
01:12:02,283 --> 01:12:06,231
Sir, I've seen that inspector.

1323
01:12:06,287 --> 01:12:09,325
Andmsoon I'll find him.

1324
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:10,727
Finish him.

1325
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:12,798
And be careful.

1326
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:17,838
RAW and Interpol are keeping
an eye on our movements.

1327
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:18,877
Look.

1328
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:22,312
We won't discuss this any further.

1329
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:25,113
I'm sending you the entire
information of this mission..

1330
01:12:25,473 --> 01:12:27,749
“Through an agent, on a CD.

1331
01:12:28,276 --> 01:12:30,381
And make no mistakes.

1332
01:12:31,746 --> 01:12:33,225
I'm arriving next week.

1333
01:12:33,715 --> 01:12:35,092
Okay?

1334
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:37,661
I have left for the station.

1335
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:42,090
What's this crowd for?
- Don't know, madam.

1336
01:12:43,191 --> 01:12:44,431
I will miss my train.

1337
01:12:44,492 --> 01:12:47,302
Hire another rickshaw.
- Okay.

1338
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:52,370
What is my mistake... let me go.

1339
01:12:52,433 --> 01:12:53,673
Let me go.

1340
01:12:53,968 --> 01:12:56,312
Don't beat me. Someone help me.
- You lodge complaint.

1341
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:57,907
Come with me.
- Leave me. Let me go.

1342
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,379
What is my mistake... don't beat me.

1343
01:13:04,512 --> 01:13:05,547
Leave me.

1344
01:13:08,116 --> 01:13:09,254
Someone help me.
- You lodge complaints.

1345
01:13:09,317 --> 01:13:09,727
Come to the police station.

1346
01:13:09,784 --> 01:13:11,661
Someone help me.
- Leave her.

1347
01:13:13,121 --> 01:13:16,125
Mom.. - Don't call me mom.
Don't call me mom.

1348
01:13:16,491 --> 01:13:20,166
You've humiliated your mother,
not just this uniform.

1349
01:13:20,228 --> 01:13:21,673
Why didn't you just die.

1350
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:23,504
Why didn't you die?

1351
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,841
What's going on?
Get her out! Get her out!

1352
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:28,545
She's my mom.

1353
01:13:28,603 --> 01:13:29,741
There is shooting going on here.

1354
01:13:30,138 --> 01:13:31,583
There is shooting going on here.

1355
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:36,611
Listen to me, mom.

1356
01:13:40,515 --> 01:13:42,324
Drive away this madwoman from here.

1357
01:13:56,531 --> 01:13:57,407
Move from here.

1358
01:13:57,732 --> 01:13:59,769
Don't touch my mother.
Don't touch my mother.

1359
01:14:00,168 --> 01:14:03,638
Listen to me, mom. Mom..

1360
01:14:07,842 --> 01:14:10,413
Mom..

1361
01:14:14,582 --> 01:14:16,584
Mom!

1362
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:18,697
Someone get me a rickshaw.

1363
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:19,823
Someone get me a taxi.

1364
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:21,798
Someone get me a rickshaw.

1365
01:14:56,829 --> 01:14:58,240
How's mom?

1366
01:15:02,335 --> 01:15:03,643
Don't know.

1367
01:15:23,356 --> 01:15:25,336
I'm not a police inspector, Kajal.

1368
01:15:25,725 --> 01:15:27,033
I was only lying.

1369
01:15:30,496 --> 01:15:32,203
I lied to mom as well.

1370
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:34,677
That's why she“

1371
01:15:36,436 --> 01:15:38,006
Mom will be fine, Vishwa“

1372
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:50,989
"I know...I'm lonely."

1373
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:57,125
"How can I live...if you leave me?"

1374
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:03,299
"Don't stay silent, say something."

1375
01:16:04,063 --> 01:16:09,376
"You can scold me if you like."

1376
01:16:10,136 --> 01:16:16,985
"You can scold me if you like."

1377
01:16:29,322 --> 01:16:31,165
Will you do as I say, son?

1378
01:16:31,457 --> 01:16:34,666
Of course, mom. I will.

1379
01:16:37,263 --> 01:16:39,106
Will you deceive me again?

1380
01:16:41,267 --> 01:16:42,302
No, mom.

1381
01:16:43,402 --> 01:16:45,177
Never again.

1382
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:47,150
Forgive me.

1383
01:16:48,608 --> 01:16:50,087
What do you want?

1384
01:16:52,011 --> 01:16:56,016
Get me...some poison.

1385
01:16:57,717 --> 01:17:00,129
I don't want to live.

1386
01:17:00,586 --> 01:17:02,327
Don't say that.

1387
01:17:02,388 --> 01:17:03,662
Don't say that, mom.

1388
01:17:05,191 --> 01:17:07,068
I'll never do anything wrong again.

1389
01:17:07,126 --> 01:17:08,605
Never again.

1390
01:17:10,696 --> 01:17:13,074
You acted so well.

1391
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:20,174
Even...your mother
couldn't recognise you.

1392
01:17:23,709 --> 01:17:25,655
You'll be a good actor.

1393
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:32,061
No, mom.

1394
01:17:32,718 --> 01:17:34,391
I don't want to be an actor.

1395
01:17:36,255 --> 01:17:38,292
I want to be a police officer.

1396
01:17:38,558 --> 01:17:41,095
An honest police officer.
I don't want to be an actor.

1397
01:17:42,061 --> 01:17:43,540
What are you doing inside?

1398
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:46,307
Please go out, it's not allowed.

1399
01:17:47,466 --> 01:17:49,104
Look, her condition's critical.

1400
01:17:49,168 --> 01:17:50,670
She needs complete rest.

1401
01:17:51,103 --> 01:17:53,947
Doctor, will my mother be okay?
- We can't say right now.

1402
01:17:54,373 --> 01:17:55,374
Please leave.

1403
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:02,184
Your mother will be fine, Vishwas.

1404
01:18:04,016 --> 01:18:05,495
She's just shocked.

1405
01:18:07,587 --> 01:18:09,328
Because her dreams were shattered.

1406
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:12,101
When you were one year old..

1407
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,699
Your father was a cruel officer.

1408
01:18:17,363 --> 01:18:19,274
He would take money from the rich..

1409
01:18:19,732 --> 01:18:21,734
“And do their dirty jobs for them.

1410
01:18:22,335 --> 01:18:24,576
'Savitri. Don't interfere.'

1411
01:18:24,637 --> 01:18:25,707
'She's a decent girl, let her..'

1412
01:18:25,771 --> 01:18:29,116
'I want to teach a lesson
to this decent girl's father.'

1413
01:18:29,175 --> 01:18:32,213
'That girl's father,
Shashtri owned a factoryu'

1414
01:18:32,278 --> 01:18:34,656
'..which was the only means
of earning for the villagers.'

1415
01:18:34,714 --> 01:18:36,751
'The rich men wanted that land.'

1416
01:18:36,816 --> 01:18:39,729
No, inspector.
Don't do that. I will sign.

1417
01:18:39,785 --> 01:18:42,129
'Helpless Shashtri
signed on the papers.'

1418
01:18:42,788 --> 01:18:46,702
'The same night both father
and daughter committed suicide.'

1419
01:18:46,759 --> 01:18:51,139
'People were furious,
they set out to kill your father.'

1420
01:18:51,197 --> 01:18:53,575
'I've told you before,
slop these illegal deeds.'

1421
01:18:53,633 --> 01:18:55,203
'The curse of these poor people..'

1422
01:18:55,268 --> 01:18:56,440
"..will never let us live happily.'

1423
01:18:56,502 --> 01:18:58,482
'If anything happens to you..'

1424
01:18:58,537 --> 01:19:01,609
'The same old thing.
The same old lecture.'

1425
01:19:02,008 --> 01:19:04,545
'I made a big mistake marrying you.'

1426
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:07,250
'I admit your father
was an honest policeman.'

1427
01:19:07,313 --> 01:19:09,657
'But how did he die? A pauper.'

1428
01:19:09,715 --> 01:19:12,525
'I don't want to die like that,
Savitri.'

1429
01:19:12,585 --> 01:19:14,223
'Everyone has to die one day.'

1430
01:19:14,287 --> 01:19:15,527
'Everyone does.'

1431
01:19:15,588 --> 01:19:18,194
'But the question
is how does one live.'

1432
01:19:18,257 --> 01:19:20,237
'If you want to live
then come with me.'

1433
01:19:20,526 --> 01:19:22,005
'They cam.'

1434
01:19:26,832 --> 01:19:27,776
Listen.

1435
01:19:57,596 --> 01:20:01,510
There are his wife and kid.
Finish them!

1436
01:20:02,301 --> 01:20:03,541
Stop!

1437
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:06,677
No one will lay a finger on them.

1438
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:08,609
I will break your heads.

1439
01:20:08,674 --> 01:20:10,517
You will save them!

1440
01:20:10,576 --> 01:20:13,284
Our curse will finish
Yashwanl Rae's family.

1441
01:20:14,013 --> 01:20:14,753
We won't spare them either.

1442
01:20:14,814 --> 01:20:17,556
We left the village.
- Both mother and son will suffer.

1443
01:20:17,616 --> 01:20:19,357
And your mother swore“

1444
01:20:20,086 --> 01:20:22,464
...that she will repent
for your father's crimes.

1445
01:20:23,289 --> 01:20:25,326
By making you an
honest police officer.

1446
01:20:26,325 --> 01:20:29,033
And people will sing
praises of your honesty.

1447
01:20:29,562 --> 01:20:32,441
It will restore people's trust
on policemen.

1448
01:20:33,165 --> 01:20:36,044
That's why I named you
Vishwas (Trust).

1449
01:20:48,214 --> 01:20:49,284
Mr. Vishwas.

1450
01:20:52,284 --> 01:20:54,161
Dr. Vinod Khanna's calling you.

1451
01:20:57,323 --> 01:20:58,666
Vinod Khanna's turned a doctor?

1452
01:20:59,058 --> 01:21:01,163
What? But he's always been a doctor.

1453
01:21:01,227 --> 01:21:02,570
Come.
- I see.

1454
01:21:03,596 --> 01:21:05,633
So, he was acting
in films just like that.

1455
01:21:05,698 --> 01:21:07,507
Stop thinking about films, Vishwas.

1456
01:21:07,566 --> 01:21:09,409
Vinod Khanna can be
someone else's name too.

1457
01:21:10,403 --> 01:21:11,381
Come on.

1458
01:21:11,704 --> 01:21:13,581
Your mother's in a bad condition.

1459
01:21:14,173 --> 01:21:15,345
We'll have to perform surgery.

1460
01:21:15,775 --> 01:21:17,277
It'll cost around one million.

1461
01:21:20,713 --> 01:21:21,657
One million?

1462
01:21:22,214 --> 01:21:23,750
Deposit the money soon.

1463
01:21:24,216 --> 01:21:25,194
We don't have much time.

1464
01:21:28,354 --> 01:21:30,197
Start preparing for
the surgery, Doctor.

1465
01:21:30,556 --> 01:21:33,298
I'll get the money.

1466
01:21:34,326 --> 01:21:35,066
Somehow.

1467
01:21:46,038 --> 01:21:47,483
You are under arrest.

1468
01:21:47,773 --> 01:21:49,309
For posing as a cop.

1469
01:21:50,509 --> 01:21:52,511
My mother's very ill.

1470
01:21:53,546 --> 01:21:55,617
I've to arrange for
one million for her surgery.

1471
01:21:56,215 --> 01:21:57,319
I am sorry!

1472
01:21:58,284 --> 01:21:59,456
Come with us.

1473
01:22:02,288 --> 01:22:03,289
Come.

1474
01:22:04,089 --> 01:22:06,296
Tell me, sir.
Where are you taking me to?

1475
01:22:06,358 --> 01:22:07,359
To us.

1476
01:22:07,426 --> 01:22:08,632
Who said that?

1477
01:22:09,595 --> 01:22:12,508
L...am Gundappa Das.

1478
01:22:14,266 --> 01:22:15,506
But why bring me here?

1479
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:19,381
You need rupees one million.

1480
01:22:19,772 --> 01:22:21,115
We'll help you.

1481
01:22:22,074 --> 01:22:22,677
Why?

1482
01:22:23,242 --> 01:22:24,448
Why will you give me the money?

1483
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,956
Because you will do a job for us.

1484
01:22:27,213 --> 01:22:29,523
Look. I won't do anything wrong.

1485
01:22:33,686 --> 01:22:37,498
No one pays one million
for doing anything good, son.

1486
01:22:42,695 --> 01:22:44,470
Hello.
- Dr. Khanna, here.

1487
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:47,067
Your mother's condition
is getting critical.

1488
01:22:49,001 --> 01:22:50,674
And you haven't paid the money yet.

1489
01:22:51,203 --> 01:22:52,648
No, sir. I'm trying, sir.

1490
01:22:53,072 --> 01:22:55,018
Please understand
and do something fast.

1491
01:22:55,074 --> 01:22:56,917
I'm trying.

1492
01:23:01,647 --> 01:23:03,149
I want rupees one million.

1493
01:23:03,582 --> 01:23:04,526
Tell me the job.

1494
01:23:05,084 --> 01:23:07,462
A cultural dance troupe“

1495
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,726
“has arrived in
Mumbai from Hong Kong.

1496
01:23:09,388 --> 01:23:12,369
Our agent has sent a CD through them.

1497
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:14,195
They're performing a show today.

1498
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:17,573
You'll go up on the
stage during the show“

1499
01:23:17,630 --> 01:23:19,473
“collect the CD and bring it here.

1500
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:21,734
But any of your henchmen
can do this job.

1501
01:23:23,235 --> 01:23:24,737
The security there is tight.

1502
01:23:25,271 --> 01:23:28,013
And it's impossible
for any stranger to get in.

1503
01:23:28,741 --> 01:23:30,152
Then how will I get in?

1504
01:23:30,809 --> 01:23:34,518
The chief security officer
for the show is Bhimsingh Thappa.

1505
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:37,424
And we had kidnapped his girl..

1506
01:23:37,483 --> 01:23:40,555
“And you rescued her on Link Road.

1507
01:23:42,087 --> 01:23:43,191
'I am Suman Thappa..'

1508
01:23:43,255 --> 01:23:45,531
'..chief security officer
Bhimsingh Thappa's daughter.'

1509
01:23:46,559 --> 01:23:48,698
Both, father and daughter think..

1510
01:23:48,994 --> 01:23:51,099
...you're an honest police officer.

1511
01:23:52,698 --> 01:23:57,010
So with their help,
you can easily get on stage.

1512
01:24:08,781 --> 01:24:11,728
"I'm the bird that
soars in the skies."

1513
01:24:11,784 --> 01:24:14,731
"Belovedmyou are the
fruit that dangles on earth."

1514
01:24:14,787 --> 01:24:17,734
"I'm the bird that
soars in the skies."

1515
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:20,600
"Belovedmyou are the
fruit that dangles on earth."

1516
01:24:20,659 --> 01:24:21,467
"But."

1517
01:24:21,527 --> 01:24:24,474
"The heart's...definitely crazy."

1518
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:27,170
"It jumps up and down."

1519
01:24:27,533 --> 01:24:30,309
"But it's always in the best mood."

1520
01:24:30,369 --> 01:24:32,349
"One, two, three, four, five.."

1521
01:24:32,404 --> 01:24:33,382
"Do the crazy dance."

1522
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:36,318
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1523
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:39,322
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1524
01:24:39,378 --> 01:24:42,154
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1525
01:24:51,423 --> 01:24:52,493
"You've an iron body."

1526
01:24:52,558 --> 01:24:54,094
"You've an iron body."

1527
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:56,036
"My heart's like magnet."

1528
01:24:56,095 --> 01:24:57,438
"My heart's like magnet."

1529
01:24:57,496 --> 01:24:58,634
"My heart."

1530
01:24:58,697 --> 01:25:00,438
"My heart's like the magnet."

1531
01:25:00,499 --> 01:25:03,139
"I've cancelled all others."

1532
01:25:03,202 --> 01:25:05,113
"You're my true lover."

1533
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,547
"You're my true lover."

1534
01:25:06,605 --> 01:25:07,606
"MY lover. "

1535
01:25:07,673 --> 01:25:09,209
"You're my true lover."

1536
01:25:09,274 --> 01:25:12,744
"Pleased in a moment,
shuts up in the next."

1537
01:25:12,811 --> 01:25:14,381
"My heart's technicolor."

1538
01:25:14,446 --> 01:25:15,754
"Changes in a moment."

1539
01:25:15,814 --> 01:25:18,761
"But it's always in the best mood."

1540
01:25:18,817 --> 01:25:22,264
"It always counts one,
two, three, four, five.."

1541
01:25:22,321 --> 01:25:23,163
"Do the crazy dance."

1542
01:25:23,222 --> 01:25:26,260
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1543
01:25:26,325 --> 01:25:29,169
"Crazy, crazymcrazy, crazy dance."

1544
01:25:35,334 --> 01:25:38,281
"Always talks lovey-dovey."

1545
01:25:38,337 --> 01:25:39,680
"Every time my sweetheart
shakes her waist."

1546
01:25:39,738 --> 01:25:41,274
"Drums play."

1547
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,013
"I'll pick every lock."

1548
01:25:43,075 --> 01:25:44,452
"Because you're my key."

1549
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:47,252
"Everyone's here to see this charade."

1550
01:25:53,352 --> 01:25:56,196
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

1551
01:25:56,255 --> 01:25:59,202
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."

"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy dance."
- Stop. Vishwas.

1556
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:17,448
Catch him, Ghorpade.

1557
01:27:16,535 --> 01:27:17,479
Vishwasl

1558
01:27:17,536 --> 01:27:19,174
Vishwasl What have you done?

1559
01:27:19,438 --> 01:27:20,974
You killed two policemen.

1560
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,117
Give me the gun.

1561
01:27:24,476 --> 01:27:25,750
You were supposed to
keep the police engrossed.

1562
01:27:26,278 --> 01:27:27,279
How did they come here?

1563
01:27:27,346 --> 01:27:28,518
I don't know.

1564
01:27:28,781 --> 01:27:31,352
Come to your senses, Vishwas.

1565
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:33,191
The car's here. Run.

1566
01:27:33,252 --> 01:27:35,129
<i>Ru-M</i>

1567
01:27:37,623 --> 01:27:39,261
Vishwas killed two policemen, sir.

1568
01:27:39,324 --> 01:27:40,200
What?

1569
01:27:42,261 --> 01:27:44,263
That's good, Ghorpade.

1570
01:27:44,329 --> 01:27:46,502
Now Vishwas has no other option“

1571
01:27:46,565 --> 01:27:49,205
“and we've a new
lifetime gang-member.

1572
01:27:51,036 --> 01:27:51,741
Yes“

1573
01:28:00,078 --> 01:28:00,715
Kajal.

1574
01:28:01,213 --> 01:28:02,658
Yes, Kajal. How's mom?

1575
01:28:03,081 --> 01:28:04,492
Mom's not in the hospital, Vishwas.

1576
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:06,028
She's not in the hospital?

1577
01:28:06,318 --> 01:28:08,764
We looked everywhere,
but can't find her.

1578
01:28:16,295 --> 01:28:19,071
Very good. Very good.

1579
01:28:19,131 --> 01:28:20,667
Boys...
- Where's my mom?

1580
01:28:21,834 --> 01:28:22,710
Mom!

1581
01:28:24,636 --> 01:28:26,115
She's right here.

1582
01:28:27,573 --> 01:28:29,678
And she's perfectly alright.

1583
01:28:31,677 --> 01:28:33,179
Don't worry.

1584
01:28:33,245 --> 01:28:34,349
She's absolutely fine.

1585
01:28:34,413 --> 01:28:36,359
She didn't need any surgery.

1586
01:28:37,349 --> 01:28:38,623
She only had blood pressure“

1587
01:28:38,684 --> 01:28:40,254
“and we controlled
it with medication.

1588
01:28:41,987 --> 01:28:43,364
So, why did you lie to me?

1589
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:44,623
I told him to.

1590
01:28:46,191 --> 01:28:49,400
Because I wanted you to do this job.

1591
01:28:50,495 --> 01:28:52,600
This is our gang-doctor.

1592
01:28:54,032 --> 01:28:57,070
Just like a family doctor
is called family doctor“

1593
01:28:57,603 --> 01:28:59,640
“similarly, I am his gang's doctor.

1594
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:02,541
What's this nonsense?

1595
01:29:04,142 --> 01:29:06,122
Your lie ruined my entire life.

1596
01:29:06,511 --> 01:29:08,650
I killed two policemen today,
and you..

1597
01:29:08,714 --> 01:29:11,194
Calm down, sonny. Calm down.

1598
01:29:12,084 --> 01:29:13,995
You asked me for a million
rupees for surgery..

1599
01:29:14,386 --> 01:29:15,763
...which I am giving you.

1600
01:29:19,358 --> 01:29:20,735
To heck with your money.

1601
01:29:21,293 --> 01:29:22,237
Where's my mom?

1602
01:29:23,228 --> 01:29:24,298
She's in that room.

1603
01:29:26,431 --> 01:29:27,774
She's angry with you.

1604
01:29:30,068 --> 01:29:32,309
You killed two policemen.

1605
01:29:35,574 --> 01:29:36,780
I had to tell her.

1606
01:29:51,056 --> 01:29:51,591
You?

1607
01:29:52,257 --> 01:29:54,203
Get out of here. Go away.

1608
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,264
I don't want to see your face.

1609
01:29:56,328 --> 01:29:58,433
Listen to me, mom..
- I don't want to hear anything.

1610
01:29:58,497 --> 01:30:00,977
I don't want to hear anything.
Just go away. Just go away.

1611
01:30:01,433 --> 01:30:03,344
Your mother's dead.

1612
01:30:03,402 --> 01:30:04,608
Your mother's dead.

1613
01:30:05,637 --> 01:30:09,278
Just go away. Go away or I'll
kill myself right now. - No, mom.

1614
01:30:09,341 --> 01:30:11,753
Just go away. Just go away.
- I'm going.

1615
01:30:12,044 --> 01:30:14,081
Go away.
- I'm leaving.

1616
01:30:14,146 --> 01:30:15,716
Just go away.

1617
01:30:24,656 --> 01:30:26,294
Your decision isn't right.

1618
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:30,465
Once you join the gang,
you won't have a way out.

1619
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:34,267
Let's go and tell the police..
- No, Kajal.

1620
01:30:36,668 --> 01:30:37,738
Mom's in their captivity.

1621
01:30:39,271 --> 01:30:42,445
You won't tell the
police anything, Kajal.

1622
01:30:42,507 --> 01:30:43,451
For my sake.

1623
01:30:44,376 --> 01:30:46,583
But, Vishwas, how is this“
- Just forget me, Kajal.

1624
01:30:47,379 --> 01:30:50,326
Your world's full
of bright life, hopes.

1625
01:30:51,416 --> 01:30:53,487
My world's filled with
darkness and nothing else.

1626
01:30:56,488 --> 01:30:58,161
We cannot be together, Kajal.

1627
01:30:58,590 --> 01:30:59,500
And“

1628
01:31:01,059 --> 01:31:01,662
And?

1629
01:31:03,095 --> 01:31:04,005
And what?

1630
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:06,134
Say it.

1631
01:31:13,005 --> 01:31:14,279
We won't meet again.

1632
01:31:18,276 --> 01:31:19,152
I'm sorry.

1633
01:31:23,015 --> 01:31:25,325
"Without me.."

1634
01:31:25,717 --> 01:31:28,527
"Without me.."

1635
01:31:28,587 --> 01:31:31,295
"Without me.."

1636
01:31:31,356 --> 01:31:33,529
"Without me.."

1637
01:31:33,792 --> 01:31:39,333
"Without me you'll be happier."

1638
01:31:39,398 --> 01:31:44,643
"Don't let my thought
ever cross your mind."

1639
01:31:45,237 --> 01:31:47,615
"Without me.."

1640
01:31:48,006 --> 01:31:50,452
"Without me.."

1641
01:31:50,709 --> 01:31:53,417
"Without me.."

1642
01:31:53,478 --> 01:31:57,221
"Without me.."

1643
01:32:06,691 --> 01:32:12,437
"I wonder where you're headed.."

1644
01:32:12,497 --> 01:32:17,742
"..leaving me at two ways."

1645
01:32:18,036 --> 01:32:22,542
"You gave me happiness.."

1646
01:32:22,607 --> 01:32:28,216
"But you snatched it from me."

1647
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:30,419
"What did you get."

1648
01:32:31,083 --> 01:32:33,393
"What did you get."

1649
01:32:33,752 --> 01:32:38,599
"What did you get by making me cry?"

1650
01:32:39,024 --> 01:32:44,201
"Don't let my thought
ever cross your mind."

1651
01:32:44,763 --> 01:32:47,209
"Without me.."

1652
01:32:47,532 --> 01:32:50,308
"Without me.."

1653
01:32:50,368 --> 01:32:54,316
"Without me.."

1654
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,018
1000 kilos of cocaine,

1655
01:33:04,683 --> 01:33:06,321
will be delivered tomorrow afternoon“

1656
01:33:06,384 --> 01:33:09,024
“to the special chamber
of the Versova warehouse.

1657
01:33:11,456 --> 01:33:14,096
The computerized lock will open..

1658
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:16,196
...only through the CD that I sent you.

1659
01:33:16,795 --> 01:33:19,605
Collect the consignment
and keep it in your warehouse.

1660
01:33:21,533 --> 01:33:22,603
I'm arriving day-after-tomorrow.

1661
01:33:22,667 --> 01:33:24,578
Same place, same time,

1662
01:33:25,637 --> 01:33:27,275
where I always land.

1663
01:33:27,339 --> 01:33:28,147
Good bye.

1664
01:33:29,074 --> 01:33:32,248
That's Napoleon sir's mission.

1665
01:33:32,744 --> 01:33:34,348
White elephant!

1666
01:33:34,646 --> 01:33:36,956
1000 kilos of cocaine!

1667
01:34:05,243 --> 01:34:06,517
Hands up. No one moves.

1668
01:34:06,578 --> 01:34:07,454
Load it. Load it.

1669
01:34:07,512 --> 01:34:08,422
Load the goods.

1670
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,687
Get down.
Get down. Jesse. Lock everybody up.

1671
01:34:10,749 --> 01:34:12,092
Lock everyone up.

1672
01:34:13,018 --> 01:34:13,428
Lock.

1673
01:34:13,485 --> 01:34:14,486
Lock them.

1674
01:34:15,587 --> 01:34:16,122
Lock.

1675
01:34:16,188 --> 01:34:19,692
Jesse. Call the area
in-charge and call them here.

1676
01:34:20,058 --> 01:34:22,504
I'm taking the truck
to the police warehouse.

1677
01:34:26,097 --> 01:34:27,405
Vishwas, you?

1678
01:34:47,252 --> 01:34:48,492
Vishwas.

1679
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:55,770
Sir..

1680
01:34:56,061 --> 01:34:58,667
How did Khare get there?

1681
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:00,732
They're policemen;
they're bound to get there.

1682
01:35:00,799 --> 01:35:02,107
But why did Vishwas go there?

1683
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:03,441
Didn't you tell him not to?

1684
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:04,571
He's a novice.

1685
01:35:04,636 --> 01:35:06,081
The commissioner
must have arrested him..

1686
01:35:06,137 --> 01:35:07,207
“And he must have blurted everything.

1687
01:35:07,272 --> 01:35:08,751
And the police must
be on their way here.

1688
01:35:11,643 --> 01:35:13,680
We're dead.
- Saved.

1689
01:35:14,346 --> 01:35:16,485
Here's your enemy,
Joint Commissioner Khare.

1690
01:35:17,148 --> 01:35:19,128
And I've delivered your truck
loaded with goods to your warehouse.

1691
01:35:19,451 --> 01:35:21,453
Ghorpade.
- Yes, sir.

1692
01:35:21,519 --> 01:35:23,999
You here?
- I work second shift here, sir.

1693
01:35:24,256 --> 01:35:25,997
Aren't you ashamed?
- I am, sir.

1694
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:28,100
Well done, Vishwas. Well done.

1695
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,799
Napoleon sir will
be very pleased with you.

1696
01:35:31,162 --> 01:35:32,607
To heck with your Napoleon.

1697
01:35:32,664 --> 01:35:35,008
I'm doing this for my mom.

1698
01:35:35,533 --> 01:35:37,035
My mom's suffering here.

1699
01:35:37,335 --> 01:35:38,643
I want to take her
back to our village.

1700
01:35:38,703 --> 01:35:40,080
How can you go?

1701
01:35:40,138 --> 01:35:42,345
The entire Mumbai
police will come here..

1702
01:35:42,407 --> 01:35:44,011
...looking for Khare sir.

1703
01:35:44,075 --> 01:35:46,112
They won't.
- Why?

1704
01:35:46,177 --> 01:35:48,316
Because he'll inform his department“

1705
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:50,485
...that he's going out
of the city for a few days“

1706
01:35:50,548 --> 01:35:52,459
“and they shouldn't look for him.
- No, I won't.

1707
01:35:54,419 --> 01:35:55,022
What?

1708
01:35:56,421 --> 01:35:57,764
You will.

1709
01:35:57,822 --> 01:35:59,563
You will say it and also help us.

1710
01:36:00,625 --> 01:36:03,162
Will you say it or not?

1711
01:36:04,195 --> 01:36:06,072
Speak.
- Yes, I will.

1712
01:36:06,431 --> 01:36:07,466
I will.

1713
01:36:08,066 --> 01:36:09,067
Good boy.

1714
01:36:09,134 --> 01:36:10,306
Tie him up.

1715
01:36:12,137 --> 01:36:13,775
Take some lessons from him, Ghorpade.

1716
01:36:14,839 --> 01:36:16,648
Take some lessons from him.

1717
01:36:19,144 --> 01:36:21,590
Why are you tying up this poor man?

1718
01:36:21,646 --> 01:36:22,716
TighUY-

1719
01:36:22,781 --> 01:36:25,557
Look, he's no police officer.

1720
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:28,023
He just likes to
roam around in uniform.

1721
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:31,325
He's a television actor.

1722
01:36:31,389 --> 01:36:32,800
I know, I know.

1723
01:36:32,857 --> 01:36:34,336
There's no television in your room.

1724
01:36:34,392 --> 01:36:36,394
That's why we brought this actor here.

1725
01:36:36,461 --> 01:36:38,998
Now watch him perform.

1726
01:36:39,297 --> 01:36:40,241
Listen“

1727
01:36:48,139 --> 01:36:49,140
Madam.

1728
01:36:51,009 --> 01:36:53,216
I am actually the joint
commissioner of police.

1729
01:36:54,713 --> 01:36:55,623
Let it be.

1730
01:36:56,381 --> 01:36:58,486
Get yourself treated by a good doctor.

1731
01:36:58,817 --> 01:37:00,694
No, try to understand.

1732
01:37:04,122 --> 01:37:06,398
Madam. These gang members“

1733
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:08,369
“were forcing Vishwas
to do a wrong deed“

1734
01:37:08,426 --> 01:37:11,236
...by making the excuse
of your illness.

1735
01:37:11,563 --> 01:37:13,133
That's when he came to me.

1736
01:37:14,366 --> 01:37:16,243
I won't do anything wrong again, sir.

1737
01:37:17,469 --> 01:37:20,006
I've a suggestion, Vishwas.
- Yes, sir.

1738
01:37:20,305 --> 01:37:21,716
Just like Gundappa said,
collect the CD..

1739
01:37:21,773 --> 01:37:23,218
“And deliver it to him.

1740
01:37:24,075 --> 01:37:26,487
Do they pay you too?
- Oh shut up!

1741
01:37:26,778 --> 01:37:29,054
I want you to join Gundappa's gang.

1742
01:37:30,048 --> 01:37:31,493
That means they definitely do.

1743
01:37:31,549 --> 01:37:32,653
L-ley, sit down!

1744
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,665
I've a plan.

1745
01:37:37,255 --> 01:37:40,600
This way we can eradicate
Gundappa and his gang.

1746
01:37:41,059 --> 01:37:42,265
And that's why..

1747
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,666
...I want you to execute
this job and enter his gang.

1748
01:37:46,364 --> 01:37:49,971
I want you to join their
gang and extract information“

1749
01:37:50,468 --> 01:37:51,708
I got it, sir.

1750
01:37:53,004 --> 01:37:55,143
Just like Amitabh
Bachchan did in 'Don'.

1751
01:37:55,206 --> 01:37:56,184
Right, sir?

1752
01:37:56,608 --> 01:37:58,019
Yes.

1753
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:03,352
And if you do that, they will
pay for your mother's surgery.

1754
01:38:03,415 --> 01:38:04,689
She will receive treatment.

1755
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:08,524
And you will join their gang
and work as a police informer.

1756
01:38:09,587 --> 01:38:11,260
I will work for the police?

1757
01:38:12,524 --> 01:38:15,164
My mother will be really happy.

1758
01:38:15,593 --> 01:38:17,698
Sister, for your happiness“

1759
01:38:17,762 --> 01:38:20,208
“Vishwas agreed to do
policeman's job.

1760
01:38:20,598 --> 01:38:25,069
While doing this job,
you will kill two policemen.

1761
01:38:25,136 --> 01:38:26,547
What are you saying, sir?

1762
01:38:26,604 --> 01:38:29,278
Not really. Fake bullets. Fake deaths.

1763
01:38:30,475 --> 01:38:34,787
This way Gundappa
will start trusting you.

1764
01:38:35,146 --> 01:38:38,025
And he won't kill you,
instead he'll let you join his gang.

1765
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:40,293
What an idea, sir.

1766
01:38:40,585 --> 01:38:43,429
No one can imagine
that you can think so well.

1767
01:38:43,488 --> 01:38:44,432
Thank you.

1768
01:38:44,489 --> 01:38:45,661
What did you say?
- See you, sir.

1769
01:38:46,057 --> 01:38:47,536
Stop.
- What now?

1770
01:38:48,059 --> 01:38:49,697
Vishwas, keep this watch.

1771
01:38:49,761 --> 01:38:51,741
Whenever you press this button“.

1772
01:38:52,130 --> 01:38:53,700
...a light will blink
on the other watch.

1773
01:38:53,998 --> 01:38:56,478
After that,
regardless of where we are..

1774
01:38:56,534 --> 01:38:59,674
“We can talk to each other,
through this watch-phone.

1775
01:39:00,171 --> 01:39:00,672
<i>Now watch.</i>

1776
01:39:00,738 --> 01:39:03,218
I'll talk and you listen.
- Sir.

1777
01:39:04,609 --> 01:39:06,111
Hello, Vishwas.

1778
01:39:06,611 --> 01:39:07,715
I've entrusted you with the job“

1779
01:39:07,779 --> 01:39:10,089
...of a secret agent
for the Mumbai Police.

1780
01:39:10,615 --> 01:39:14,085
You'll have to do this
job with great responsibility.

1781
01:39:14,552 --> 01:39:15,997
Are you listening?

1782
01:39:16,588 --> 01:39:18,693
Of course, sir. I'm with you, sir.

1783
01:39:19,324 --> 01:39:22,396
You had to stand there and
listen over the watch-phone, idiot!

1784
01:39:23,228 --> 01:39:24,400
Where are you going?

1785
01:39:24,462 --> 01:39:26,066
To stand there and listen, sir.

1786
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:27,131
Vishwas.

1787
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:28,142
Sir..

1788
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,643
Will you be able to do this job?

1789
01:39:30,702 --> 01:39:32,340
Of course, sir.
I'll do it really well.

1790
01:39:33,304 --> 01:39:34,146
Okay.

1791
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:37,315
Then keep this phone.
- Thank you, sir.

1792
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:38,718
But I have a phone.

1793
01:39:38,776 --> 01:39:41,484
This isn't for making calls, Vishwas.

1794
01:39:41,546 --> 01:39:44,322
When you press this button twice..

1795
01:39:44,382 --> 01:39:46,726
...It will give out a blinding flash“

1796
01:39:47,018 --> 01:39:50,124
“and severe everyone's
vision for a while.

1797
01:39:50,188 --> 01:39:52,464
This will help you
when you're in trouble.

1798
01:39:52,757 --> 01:39:54,065
Wonderful, sir.

1799
01:39:54,125 --> 01:39:56,298
You just turned me
into James Bond, sir.

1800
01:39:57,462 --> 01:39:59,237
Why did you press the button now?

1801
01:39:59,297 --> 01:40:00,674
I was testing it, sir.

1802
01:40:00,732 --> 01:40:03,611
You could've told me so.
I would've closed my eyes.

1803
01:40:04,135 --> 01:40:06,445
Now listen.
- Sir, I can't see a thing.

1804
01:40:06,504 --> 01:40:09,508
You need ears to listen.

1805
01:40:09,574 --> 01:40:10,746
I do have ears, sir.

1806
01:40:11,042 --> 01:40:13,579
So, look..
- I can't see, sir.

1807
01:40:13,645 --> 01:40:17,650
Oh God! Listen and understand.
- Yes, sir.

1808
01:40:18,049 --> 01:40:21,519
The secret, that you're
working for Mumbai Police..

1809
01:40:21,586 --> 01:40:23,361
...you won't reveal it to anyone.

1810
01:40:23,421 --> 01:40:25,264
Not even your mother.
- Why, sir?

1811
01:40:25,323 --> 01:40:28,600
If the gang-members find out,
they will shoot you.

1812
01:40:29,027 --> 01:40:30,370
And if you have an
encounter with the police..

1813
01:40:30,428 --> 01:40:32,305
“They will kill you too.
- Oh God!

1814
01:40:32,363 --> 01:40:33,501
But why, sir?

1815
01:40:33,565 --> 01:40:36,171
I'm working for the police.
- Yes.

1816
01:40:36,234 --> 01:40:39,272
You know it, I know it..

1817
01:40:39,337 --> 01:40:41,408
...but the police department doesn't.

1818
01:40:41,472 --> 01:40:42,712
I can see again.

1819
01:40:43,675 --> 01:40:44,676
Where are you?

1820
01:40:45,443 --> 01:40:46,581
There you are.
- Sir“

1821
01:40:47,278 --> 01:40:48,313
Sir, I suggest that
you write it down on paper“

1822
01:40:48,379 --> 01:40:49,323
“that I work for
the police department“

1823
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,450
“and keep it somewhere safe.
- Why?

1824
01:40:50,515 --> 01:40:53,223
Because,
if you die I'll be in trouble.

1825
01:40:53,518 --> 01:40:55,395
Amitabh had to face lot
of problems in 'Don', sir.

1826
01:40:55,453 --> 01:40:57,626
Fine, fine. I will.

1827
01:40:57,689 --> 01:41:00,260
But now you go and execute
your mission cautiously.

1828
01:41:00,325 --> 01:41:01,303
Good luck.

1829
01:41:02,226 --> 01:41:04,934
Vishwas is working for the police.

1830
01:41:06,331 --> 01:41:08,333
Is it true, Mr. Commissioner?

1831
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:10,208
Absolutely true.

1832
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:14,546
No, madam. Please don't cry.

1833
01:41:15,106 --> 01:41:17,382
Vishwas is always worried about you.

1834
01:41:17,709 --> 01:41:18,744
Please don't worry.

1835
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:20,689
Everything will be alright.

1836
01:41:21,179 --> 01:41:22,522
Goddess.

1837
01:41:23,414 --> 01:41:28,227
Let my Vishwas be
successful in his mission.

1838
01:41:28,286 --> 01:41:30,527
We've to foil Vishwas'
mission at any cost.

1839
01:41:30,588 --> 01:41:32,590
We should stop him from
committing anymore crime.

1840
01:41:32,657 --> 01:41:34,568
You said he's joined some gang.

1841
01:41:34,626 --> 01:41:36,469
What can we possibly do now?

1842
01:41:37,295 --> 01:41:40,674
We should do something to
foil the entire gang's mission.

1843
01:41:40,732 --> 01:41:42,473
And Vishwas gets the credit for it.

1844
01:41:42,533 --> 01:41:44,513
And he becomes a hero
in the view of the law.

1845
01:41:44,569 --> 01:41:45,639
Hero?

1846
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:49,017
To be the hero one
needs to kill the villain.

1847
01:41:49,273 --> 01:41:50,274
Tell me one thing“

1848
01:41:50,341 --> 01:41:51,649
In his film..
- What?

1849
01:41:51,709 --> 01:41:55,350
Sorry. Who's the villain in his story?

1850
01:42:03,021 --> 01:42:04,261
Yes!

1851
01:42:04,322 --> 01:42:05,426
Napoleon sir.

1852
01:42:05,490 --> 01:42:08,232
I've configured this
just like you wanted me to.

1853
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:10,033
Ready to go.
- Very good.

1854
01:42:10,695 --> 01:42:11,571
Ready to...go.

1855
01:42:14,232 --> 01:42:15,404
Relax, gentlemen.

1856
01:42:15,466 --> 01:42:16,467
Relax.

1857
01:42:17,335 --> 01:42:21,112
He knew too much about
our mission White Elephant.

1858
01:42:21,372 --> 01:42:22,646
I don't take chances.

1859
01:42:24,008 --> 01:42:25,282
Now I'm ready.

1860
01:42:25,643 --> 01:42:28,385
Ready to tighten the
noose around Mumbai's neck.

1861
01:42:28,746 --> 01:42:30,521
As soon as I wring Mumbai's neck“

1862
01:42:30,782 --> 01:42:32,659
“entire India will scream.

1863
01:42:34,152 --> 01:42:37,133
Your organization's motive
will be fulfilled soon.

1864
01:42:37,188 --> 01:42:38,963
And what if you fail?

1865
01:42:39,424 --> 01:42:42,962
Remember,
you can deceive the Indian Police..

1866
01:42:43,294 --> 01:42:44,602
“But not us.

1867
01:42:45,596 --> 01:42:49,009
You know what we can“

1868
01:42:49,567 --> 01:42:51,342
“and are capable of doing.

1869
01:42:51,402 --> 01:42:54,474
Escaped convict
inspector Yeshwant Rao.

1870
01:42:56,574 --> 01:43:00,215
You shouldn't utter
the name of the dead.

1871
01:43:01,479 --> 01:43:04,426
Napoleon always completes his mission.

1872
01:43:05,383 --> 01:43:07,954
Everyone knows that in our world.

1873
01:43:08,352 --> 01:43:11,128
Transfer the money in my account.

1874
01:43:13,324 --> 01:43:14,735
Goodbye.

1875
01:43:17,361 --> 01:43:19,534
What's wrong, sir?
You called for me urgently.

1876
01:43:19,797 --> 01:43:22,038
You know her?
- Hello.

1877
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,207
You? Who are you?

1878
01:43:25,269 --> 01:43:27,579
Well done! Bravo, son!

1879
01:43:27,638 --> 01:43:30,118
Today you refuse to
recognise my daughter.

1880
01:43:30,174 --> 01:43:32,245
But I hope you recognise me.

1881
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:33,755
Thakur Joginder Singh.

1882
01:43:34,178 --> 01:43:35,350
Who are they, sir?

1883
01:43:35,413 --> 01:43:37,120
Let's kill him, father..
- Let's kidnap him, father.

1884
01:43:37,181 --> 01:43:38,524
Shut up you fool.

1885
01:43:39,016 --> 01:43:41,326
Do you want to make
your sister a widow?

1886
01:43:41,686 --> 01:43:44,292
Have you thought
what we'll tell Manglu?

1887
01:43:44,555 --> 01:43:47,468
Manglu? Who's Manglu?
- I don't know, sir.

1888
01:43:47,525 --> 01:43:49,095
Let's kill him, father..
- Let's kidnap him, father..

1889
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,140
Quiet. We'll kill him,
we'll kidnap him.

1890
01:43:51,662 --> 01:43:54,006
But for now,
we're here to talk marriage.

1891
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,508
Stop that, Priest.

1892
01:43:57,568 --> 01:43:59,445
He's right. Don't waste it.

1893
01:43:59,971 --> 01:44:01,473
Now he'll convince the groom.

1894
01:44:01,773 --> 01:44:04,219
Uncle Gundu.
- Gundu?

1895
01:44:04,275 --> 01:44:05,015
Yes, you.

1896
01:44:05,076 --> 01:44:06,714
Convince him or we'll call the police.

1897
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:09,719
Give me your phone.
- No police. No police.

1898
01:44:10,014 --> 01:44:11,493
Wow! it must be telepathy,
the police are already here.

1899
01:44:11,549 --> 01:44:14,655
Lovely India, dear.
- Sir, you called me urgently.

1900
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:17,461
Who are they?
- Kajal? You here?

1901
01:44:17,522 --> 01:44:19,524
Thank God, at least you recognised me.

1902
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:22,332
Do you know her?
- Yes. She's complaint Kajal.

1903
01:44:22,393 --> 01:44:24,395
She always comes to the
police station with a complaint.

1904
01:44:24,462 --> 01:44:25,668
I've a complaint today as well.

1905
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:27,403
Who's it about?
- Him.

1906
01:44:28,099 --> 01:44:31,478
He loved me. We sung duets.

1907
01:44:31,536 --> 01:44:35,211
He promised to marry me. And“
- No.

1908
01:44:37,208 --> 01:44:40,678
No, dear.
Don't get into too much detail.

1909
01:44:41,145 --> 01:44:43,625
You've already lost your honour.

1910
01:44:43,681 --> 01:44:46,321
Now think about your father.

1911
01:44:46,384 --> 01:44:47,761
Sir, they're all lying.

1912
01:44:48,419 --> 01:44:50,524
Let's kill him, father..
- Let's kidnap him, father.

1913
01:44:50,588 --> 01:44:51,566
Shut up you fool.

1914
01:44:52,089 --> 01:44:56,765
If we kill him,
what are we going to tell Manglu?

1915
01:44:56,828 --> 01:44:59,468
Manglu? Who's Manglu?
- I don't know, Gundappa sir.

1916
01:44:59,530 --> 01:45:01,532
Let's kill him, father..
- Let's kidnap him, father.

1917
01:45:01,599 --> 01:45:03,408
Violence again!

1918
01:45:03,467 --> 01:45:05,276
Small moustache, big mouth.

1919
01:45:05,336 --> 01:45:09,307
If we kill him,
what are we going to tell Manglu?

1920
01:45:09,373 --> 01:45:10,613
Just a minute.

1921
01:45:10,675 --> 01:45:12,655
Who is Manglu?

1922
01:45:12,710 --> 01:45:15,247
You don't know about Manglu, sir?
- No, I don't.

1923
01:45:16,714 --> 01:45:18,159
Manglu. Little son.

1924
01:45:18,216 --> 01:45:20,389
Vishwas' little son. Still to be born.

1925
01:45:20,451 --> 01:45:22,453
He's still in my daughter's womb.

1926
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,521
Manglu. Hold this, son.

1927
01:45:23,588 --> 01:45:25,499
Vishwas. What is this?

1928
01:45:25,556 --> 01:45:27,126
I don't know, sir. This is not mine.

1929
01:45:27,191 --> 01:45:28,761
Shut up. Come here.

1930
01:45:28,826 --> 01:45:33,536
Come here. Come here.
Look. Napoleon sir's arriving tonight.

1931
01:45:33,598 --> 01:45:36,772
If they mess up anything,
then we'll be dead.

1932
01:45:36,834 --> 01:45:39,405
Just tell me clearly.
If you don't know them“

1933
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:41,143
...I'll kill them right
now and bury them here.

1934
01:45:42,206 --> 01:45:43,150
Now tell me clearly.

1935
01:45:43,207 --> 01:45:45,983
Did you have any
relation with this girl?

1936
01:45:50,314 --> 01:45:51,292
A little.

1937
01:45:51,782 --> 01:45:53,125
Just a little?

1938
01:45:57,455 --> 01:45:59,696
A little more.

1939
01:45:59,757 --> 01:46:01,395
Oh God“

1940
01:46:03,728 --> 01:46:07,175
Look. I've convinced
Vishwas for the marriage.

1941
01:46:08,332 --> 01:46:10,642
Stop that, Priest.
Or I will shoot you.

1942
01:46:11,102 --> 01:46:12,706
I just convinced him for now.

1943
01:46:14,071 --> 01:46:14,742
Look.

1944
01:46:14,805 --> 01:46:16,250
We've an important job to do.

1945
01:46:16,307 --> 01:46:18,253
We'll first finish that
job and then the wedding.

1946
01:46:18,309 --> 01:46:20,755
That's called justice.

1947
01:46:21,045 --> 01:46:22,991
His Majesty's justice.

1948
01:46:23,547 --> 01:46:25,788
I won't say it! I won't say it!

1949
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:26,692
I won't say it!

1950
01:46:26,751 --> 01:46:28,753
You'll have to say it, sir!
Right, sir?

1951
01:46:29,053 --> 01:46:31,363
What, sir?
Tell him what he has to say.

1952
01:46:31,422 --> 01:46:35,393
He'll say it. - Sir,
you'll have to make up an excuse“

1953
01:46:35,459 --> 01:46:38,497
“and divert the coast
guards at Gorai tonight.

1954
01:46:38,562 --> 01:46:39,472
Okay?

1955
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,640
I will shoot you, sir.

1956
01:46:44,201 --> 01:46:46,306
I won't say it even if you shoot me.

1957
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:49,749
You're refusing us?
I will cut off your nose.

1958
01:46:50,041 --> 01:46:51,714
No, not my nose.

1959
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:53,619
Then I'll cut off your tongue.

1960
01:46:54,445 --> 01:46:56,186
If you do that, how will I speak?
- Yeah.

1961
01:46:56,247 --> 01:46:58,750
You will say it, won't you
- Of course I will.

1962
01:46:58,816 --> 01:47:00,454
I will. I will.

1963
01:47:00,518 --> 01:47:02,589
I will do just as you say.

1964
01:47:03,154 --> 01:47:04,724
Take some lessons, Ghorpade.

1965
01:47:05,289 --> 01:47:07,291
Take some lessons from him.
- Yes, sir.

1966
01:47:07,358 --> 01:47:08,234
God bless you.

1967
01:47:10,528 --> 01:47:12,166
Sir. You asked for a knife.

1968
01:47:12,229 --> 01:47:13,731
Here's the knife.
- Thank you.

1969
01:47:14,031 --> 01:47:16,341
But, sir. You've diverted the police.

1970
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,777
How will they catch Napoleon now?

1971
01:47:17,835 --> 01:47:19,473
We don't catch Napoleon tonight.

1972
01:47:19,537 --> 01:47:22,643
We've to catch Napoleon tonight.
- No worry.

1973
01:47:22,707 --> 01:47:25,244
Even if the police
manage to catch Napoleon..

1974
01:47:25,309 --> 01:47:28,051
“We won't find his
other agents in India.

1975
01:47:28,112 --> 01:47:31,423
We'll prove that capturing
Napoleon was Vishwas' plan.

1976
01:47:31,849 --> 01:47:34,090
Yes. - And Vishwas'
crimes will be pardoned.

1977
01:47:34,485 --> 01:47:36,158
Then he'll become a hero tomorrow.

1978
01:47:36,220 --> 01:47:37,198
Not tomorrow, but the day-after“

1979
01:47:37,254 --> 01:47:38,756
...we'll arrest Napoleon,
his entire gang“

1980
01:47:38,823 --> 01:47:41,133
“and all his agents red-handed.

1981
01:47:41,192 --> 01:47:43,138
Wow! What a plan, sir.

1982
01:48:05,783 --> 01:48:06,693
Napoleon!

1983
01:48:06,751 --> 01:48:08,196
Surrender yourself.

1984
01:48:24,568 --> 01:48:26,570
One year of hard work..

1985
01:48:27,371 --> 01:48:29,442
“Was foiled in a single night.

1986
01:48:30,641 --> 01:48:33,121
All because of one traitor.

1987
01:48:34,245 --> 01:48:35,315
Who is it?

1988
01:48:37,448 --> 01:48:38,688
Who is it?

1989
01:48:40,217 --> 01:48:42,254
Who is the traitor amongst you..

1990
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:43,662
“That informed the police?

1991
01:48:43,721 --> 01:48:46,668
The police...arrived
their coincidentally, sir.

1992
01:48:46,724 --> 01:48:50,069
It was no coincidence!

1993
01:48:50,661 --> 01:48:53,107
They came prepared.

1994
01:48:54,131 --> 01:48:57,112
Thank God I managed to save this bag.

1995
01:48:57,535 --> 01:48:59,981
Otherwise,
everything would've been over.

1996
01:49:00,805 --> 01:49:03,285
This mission can't be completed“

1997
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:05,251
...without this bag.

1998
01:49:07,144 --> 01:49:09,090
Find that traitor.

1999
01:49:09,547 --> 01:49:11,720
Otherwise, I will kill all of you.

2000
01:49:12,216 --> 01:49:13,194
Sir.

2001
01:49:15,186 --> 01:49:16,494
I doubt someone.

2002
01:49:20,291 --> 01:49:22,532
You doubt me? Me?

2003
01:49:23,194 --> 01:49:25,196
I could've been arrested as well.

2004
01:49:25,696 --> 01:49:27,676
I could've died in
the police firing as well.

2005
01:49:28,599 --> 01:49:30,078
How could you forget Gundappa sir..

2006
01:49:30,134 --> 01:49:31,579
...who risked his life
to bring you that CD?

2007
01:49:32,236 --> 01:49:33,146
Me.

2008
01:49:34,805 --> 01:49:36,580
I had to kill two policemen
and I didn't hesitate“

2009
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,517
“just for your CD, Gundappa sir.

2010
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:41,956
But you still doubt me.

2011
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:43,584
Mel

2012
01:49:47,518 --> 01:49:48,929
Hello, aunt.

2013
01:49:49,487 --> 01:49:51,398
You here?

2014
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,735
These goons abducted you too.

2015
01:49:53,791 --> 01:49:55,361
They can't abduct me.

2016
01:49:55,426 --> 01:49:58,066
I came here willingly.
- What?

2017
01:49:58,329 --> 01:50:01,105
And that day,
I brought your truck safe and sound“

2018
01:50:01,165 --> 01:50:02,576
“from the warehouse!

2019
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,971
And also brought your enemy Khare.

2020
01:50:07,304 --> 01:50:09,181
But you still“

2021
01:50:13,777 --> 01:50:17,520
My son's doing a good job here.
- Good job?

2022
01:50:18,082 --> 01:50:20,722
Did you join the gang
along with your son?

2023
01:50:21,485 --> 01:50:25,365
If you still don't trust me..

2024
01:50:25,422 --> 01:50:26,992
Then it's better that I die.

2025
01:50:27,358 --> 01:50:29,065
Then it's better that I die.

2026
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:33,033
My son's working for the police.

2027
01:50:34,231 --> 01:50:35,437
Police!

2028
01:50:35,499 --> 01:50:37,410
But, Gundappa sir..

2029
01:50:38,035 --> 01:50:40,709
...I don't want you
to shed innocent blood.

2030
01:50:41,172 --> 01:50:42,981
That's why I'm going to kill myself.

2031
01:50:43,641 --> 01:50:45,018
Give me the gun.

2032
01:50:45,309 --> 01:50:46,481
Give me the gun.

2033
01:50:46,544 --> 01:50:47,614
Give me the gun.

2034
01:50:48,212 --> 01:50:48,656
You give it.

2035
01:50:49,079 --> 01:50:50,114
Give it.

2036
01:50:50,581 --> 01:50:51,559
Stop it, Vishwas.

2037
01:50:54,585 --> 01:50:56,565
Gundappa, what do you think?

2038
01:50:56,620 --> 01:51:01,194
Sir. I think it's
a sin to doubt this boy.

2039
01:51:03,327 --> 01:51:04,397
Sorry, Vishwas.

2040
01:51:04,662 --> 01:51:05,697
Boys, come back.

2041
01:51:05,996 --> 01:51:07,100
Go. Go.

2042
01:51:11,001 --> 01:51:13,607
Sorry. Sorry.
- It's okay.

2043
01:51:13,671 --> 01:51:15,116
Sorry, Vishwas.

2044
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:18,316
I'm really sorry. Forgive me.

2045
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:21,053
It was a mistake.
- Its okay.

2046
01:51:21,111 --> 01:51:22,215
No problem. Go.

2047
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:26,657
Don't drive me away.
- I'm not angry.

2048
01:51:26,717 --> 01:51:30,358
This is my love for you.

2049
01:51:30,421 --> 01:51:31,729
Go, go, goodbye.

2050
01:51:32,823 --> 01:51:34,063
Mom just told me.

2051
01:51:34,124 --> 01:51:37,537
I don't care what
your mom said to you.

2052
01:51:37,595 --> 01:51:39,336
Your mom said that the police“

2053
01:51:39,396 --> 01:51:42,002
Don't try to threaten me.

2054
01:51:42,066 --> 01:51:44,205
I cannot marry you.
- What?

2055
01:51:44,501 --> 01:51:47,141
I've things to do for uncle Gundu.

2056
01:51:47,204 --> 01:51:49,684
Learn, Ghorpade.
Learn from him. He's our benefactor.

2057
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:54,655
He's our God.

2058
01:51:54,712 --> 01:51:57,454
How much longer are you
going to fool that stupid Gundu?

2059
01:51:58,449 --> 01:51:59,689
Your mom has told me everything“

2060
01:51:59,984 --> 01:52:01,930
“that you're working for the police.

2061
01:52:03,053 --> 01:52:05,158
You're fooling everyone here.
- No.

2062
01:52:06,056 --> 01:52:08,127
Now, together we'll
apprehend the entire gang.

2063
01:52:08,192 --> 01:52:09,193
Yahoo!

2064
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:11,206
See. I am right.

2065
01:52:11,528 --> 01:52:13,064
Why are you quiet? Say something.

2066
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:15,110
Now it's their turn to say.

2067
01:52:17,134 --> 01:52:18,135
Come on.

2068
01:52:19,003 --> 01:52:20,141
The boss has called you.
- Come.

2069
01:52:26,477 --> 01:52:27,421
Hello. Hello.

2070
01:52:27,478 --> 01:52:29,219
We're caught now, Kajal.

2071
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,692
Only God can save us
from Napoleon's wrath now.

2072
01:52:31,749 --> 01:52:33,751
The one who listens to me,
protect my honor.

2073
01:52:36,387 --> 01:52:38,230
Gundappa. Whafve you got to say now?

2074
01:52:38,289 --> 01:52:41,498
Sir, it'll be a sin to trust this boy.

2075
01:52:41,558 --> 01:52:43,663
I want to shoot him.
- Enough.

2076
01:52:44,628 --> 01:52:46,369
Do you two have
anything to say? - Yes.

2077
01:52:46,664 --> 01:52:48,473
I'm very, very sorry sir.
- Hey!

2078
01:52:48,532 --> 01:52:50,534
I mean, we're very, very sorry sir.

2079
01:52:50,601 --> 01:52:51,705
We made a mistake.

2080
01:52:51,769 --> 01:52:53,373
I didn't know there
was a camera up there.

2081
01:52:53,437 --> 01:52:55,417
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have said what I did.

2082
01:52:56,040 --> 01:52:57,041
Lovely India.

2083
01:52:57,107 --> 01:53:00,714
The adorable couple together.

2084
01:53:00,778 --> 01:53:02,155
And in the Yoga pose.

2085
01:53:02,212 --> 01:53:04,453
Stop it, Guruji.
- Why should I?

2086
01:53:04,515 --> 01:53:07,155
We've already fooled uncle Gundu..

2087
01:53:07,217 --> 01:53:09,561
Now there's going to be celebrations.

2088
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:11,463
Singing and dancing.

2089
01:53:11,522 --> 01:53:12,728
Stop this charade.

2090
01:53:12,790 --> 01:53:13,928
Shut up!

2091
01:53:16,327 --> 01:53:17,965
Why didn't you tell me?

2092
01:53:19,229 --> 01:53:21,675
Who's this new character,
Jackie Shroff type?

2093
01:53:22,166 --> 01:53:24,077
Boys. Ready to fire!

2094
01:53:26,337 --> 01:53:31,753
Sir...I've one last
wish...before I die.

2095
01:53:31,809 --> 01:53:32,549
What?

2096
01:53:34,144 --> 01:53:37,148
I want to hear the 'Gayatri
Mantra' before I die.

2097
01:53:37,214 --> 01:53:39,353
Where do we get the
'Gayatri Mantra' from?

2098
01:53:39,416 --> 01:53:41,953
I have it, sir.
I have it. On my phone.

2099
01:53:43,053 --> 01:53:44,225
See.

2100
01:53:44,288 --> 01:53:45,289
You can hear it too.

2101
01:53:45,356 --> 01:53:46,699
It'll wash away some of your sins.

2102
01:53:46,990 --> 01:53:49,527
And we'll leave this world.

2103
01:53:49,593 --> 01:53:50,571
Fine, fine, hurry up.

2104
01:53:50,627 --> 01:53:52,334
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

2105
01:53:52,396 --> 01:53:54,342
Come on, everyone close your eyes.

2106
01:53:54,398 --> 01:53:56,241
We're going to die anyway,
why close our..

2107
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:57,711
Just close your eyes!

2108
01:53:57,768 --> 01:54:00,044
Close your eyes.

2109
01:54:04,341 --> 01:54:05,285
Why can't I see?

2110
01:54:06,710 --> 01:54:08,189
Don't shoot me.

2111
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:09,685
Open your eyes.
- Why?

2112
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:12,085
Close the doors. Don't let them run.

2113
01:54:12,149 --> 01:54:13,355
<i>Ru-M</i>

2114
01:54:14,685 --> 01:54:15,925
Come on, quickly.

2115
01:54:16,286 --> 01:54:17,731
I won't let you go. I will catch you.

2116
01:54:18,021 --> 01:54:20,695
Caught one, sir.
- Idiot, this is my hand.

2117
01:54:20,991 --> 01:54:22,299
Hey, here.. here.. here.

2118
01:54:22,359 --> 01:54:23,667
Close the doors.

2119
01:54:24,628 --> 01:54:27,108
That way.
- Sir, caught one.

2120
01:54:27,164 --> 01:54:28,643
It's me again.

2121
01:54:28,699 --> 01:54:30,007
Sorry, sir.

2122
01:54:30,067 --> 01:54:32,240
Where is everyone?

2123
01:54:32,302 --> 01:54:34,578
Close the door on the left.

2124
01:54:35,072 --> 01:54:37,018
That's the shortcut.

2125
01:54:37,374 --> 01:54:38,409
Left! Left!

2126
01:54:38,475 --> 01:54:39,579
Where are you going?

2127
01:54:39,643 --> 01:54:41,953
Where are you going?
How will you run away like that?

2128
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:44,726
I can see everything.

2129
01:54:44,782 --> 01:54:47,194
Vishwasl Stay there. Stay there.

2130
01:54:49,753 --> 01:54:51,130
They escaped.

2131
01:54:52,122 --> 01:54:53,760
Don't just stand there, find them.

2132
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:56,304
They took my bag too.
- Which bag, sir?

2133
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:59,136
My bag's essential for my mission.

2134
01:54:59,196 --> 01:55:02,234
Go. Get Vishwas' mother.
- Yes, sir.

2135
01:55:05,602 --> 01:55:07,445
Who kept the door open?

2136
01:55:07,704 --> 01:55:09,547
He escaped.

2137
01:55:10,607 --> 01:55:12,416
He took the mother along.

2138
01:55:12,709 --> 01:55:13,744
Sir, he's written something here.

2139
01:55:14,044 --> 01:55:15,318
So read it.

2140
01:55:15,379 --> 01:55:17,655
"The food here is really pathetic."

2141
01:55:17,714 --> 01:55:20,661
"Please change the cook,
Joint Commissioner Khare."

2142
01:55:21,251 --> 01:55:23,356
Fool.
- No, sir. He's absolutely right.

2143
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:24,660
I've complained about this too.

2144
01:55:24,721 --> 01:55:26,428
The food's really pathetic.
- Shut up!

2145
01:55:39,636 --> 01:55:41,377
Sir. Inspector Jesse reporting, sir.

2146
01:55:41,438 --> 01:55:42,212
What's the news?

2147
01:55:42,473 --> 01:55:43,543
Gundappa's den is empty, sir.

2148
01:55:43,607 --> 01:55:44,312
What?

2149
01:55:44,374 --> 01:55:45,682
They've fled.
- Keep informing.

2150
01:55:45,742 --> 01:55:46,550
Yes, sir.

2151
01:55:51,215 --> 01:55:53,525
This isn't cocaine, sir.
- What?

2152
01:55:53,584 --> 01:55:54,562
It's powder.

2153
01:55:55,118 --> 01:55:57,325
Are you sure?
- 100% sure, sir.

2154
01:56:03,393 --> 01:56:04,371
Yes, Vishwas. Where are you?

2155
01:56:04,428 --> 01:56:07,238
Sir, we've escaped from
Gundappa's den. - Very good.

2156
01:56:07,297 --> 01:56:08,435
We've escaped too.

2157
01:56:08,499 --> 01:56:10,137
And mom?
- She's fine.

2158
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:12,339
And Kajal?
I sent Kajal to meet up with you.

2159
01:56:12,402 --> 01:56:13,745
Yes, she's here too.

2160
01:56:14,037 --> 01:56:16,643
She's with your mother.
Both are under police protection.

2161
01:56:16,707 --> 01:56:17,777
Listen to me.

2162
01:56:17,841 --> 01:56:19,445
Napoleon's tricked us.

2163
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:21,421
That truck wasn't filled with cocaine.

2164
01:56:21,478 --> 01:56:22,786
It was some bogus powder.

2165
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:26,527
That means 'Mission White
Elephant' is something else.

2166
01:56:26,583 --> 01:56:28,756
Sir, whatever it is,
it's in a black bag.

2167
01:56:29,052 --> 01:56:31,692
And that black bag's with me.
- Very good.

2168
01:56:31,755 --> 01:56:35,567
Get that bag to Crime
Branch Special Unit Zone 3!

2169
01:56:35,626 --> 01:56:37,196
That's where I am.
- Yes, sir.

2170
01:56:45,536 --> 01:56:47,538
I am not a policeman,
but Napoleon's man.

2171
01:56:55,579 --> 01:56:58,025
Hello.
- We've abducted your mother.

2172
01:56:59,283 --> 01:57:02,287
Get that black bag back
to Vasai Fort in one hour.

2173
01:57:03,253 --> 01:57:06,234
Once you're there,
I'll give you further directions.

2174
01:57:06,657 --> 01:57:09,399
You've only 60 minutes.

2175
01:57:10,661 --> 01:57:15,041
If you try to act smart,
you will never find your mother again.

2176
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:17,672
Seal the entire city.

2177
01:57:17,734 --> 01:57:20,214
Set up check-posts.
- May I come in, sir?

2178
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:21,340
Come, Vishwas.

2179
01:57:22,272 --> 01:57:23,512
Vishwas, there's bad news for you.

2180
01:57:23,574 --> 01:57:24,712
I know, sir.

2181
01:57:24,775 --> 01:57:26,345
Napoleon has kidnapped my mother.

2182
01:57:27,311 --> 01:57:28,688
How did you know?

2183
01:57:28,745 --> 01:57:30,156
He just called, sir.

2184
01:57:30,747 --> 01:57:33,557
He said, "if I don't return
him this bag in an hour.."

2185
01:57:33,850 --> 01:57:35,420
"..he will kill my mother".

2186
01:57:36,587 --> 01:57:37,691
Here, sir.

2187
01:57:38,155 --> 01:57:39,725
Yet you brought this bag here.

2188
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:43,328
Mom always said,
"Duty comes first, relations later".

2189
01:57:43,727 --> 01:57:45,331
So, I've done my duty“

2190
01:57:45,395 --> 01:57:46,601
...now I'm going to save my mother.

2191
01:57:51,368 --> 01:57:52,540
Wait, Vishwas.

2192
01:57:54,171 --> 01:57:55,946
Go give them this bag.

2193
01:57:57,307 --> 01:58:01,153
Sir? - I know we lagged
in protecting your mother.

2194
01:58:01,211 --> 01:58:04,124
But now Mumbai Police
will do its best in saving her.

2195
01:58:04,181 --> 01:58:05,717
Go.
- But, sir, this bag“

2196
01:58:05,782 --> 01:58:07,591
Trust me, we will handle everything.

2197
01:58:07,651 --> 01:58:09,153
Now go fast.

2198
01:58:12,322 --> 01:58:15,531
I kept the police
engrossed with cocaine.

2199
01:58:16,026 --> 01:58:19,303
And diverted their complete
attention on you, Gundappa.

2200
01:58:19,363 --> 01:58:24,210
And quietly,
cleverly fixed bio-chemical weapons“

2201
01:58:24,267 --> 01:58:26,577
...at four important
places in the city.

2202
01:58:27,471 --> 01:58:29,075
That's my real mission.

2203
01:58:29,339 --> 01:58:31,341
Mission White Elephant.

2204
01:58:32,075 --> 01:58:33,679
Bio-chemical blast!

2205
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:41,023
An RDX blast kills only those
that are in proximity.

2206
01:58:41,084 --> 01:58:44,031
But a bio-chemical blast
will also kill those

2207
01:58:44,087 --> 01:58:46,089
who are safe in their homes.

2208
01:58:46,356 --> 01:58:48,461
Because bio-chemical is a liquid.

2209
01:58:49,126 --> 01:58:51,504
It will turn into gas
right after the blast.

2210
01:58:51,561 --> 01:58:56,476
And spread a dangerous,
incurable disease through air.

2211
01:58:57,434 --> 01:58:59,038
In the entire city.

2212
01:59:15,352 --> 01:59:17,593
Your son, my enemy's here.

2213
01:59:21,792 --> 01:59:23,169
Savitri?

2214
01:59:24,261 --> 01:59:27,174
You...are still alive.

2215
01:59:28,465 --> 01:59:29,307
That means...

2216
01:59:31,835 --> 01:59:33,109
Vishwas“

2217
01:59:35,472 --> 01:59:36,473
I...

2218
01:59:37,607 --> 01:59:39,416
I looked everywhere for you, Savitri.

2219
01:59:39,476 --> 01:59:41,422
You're dead for us.
- No.

2220
01:59:42,212 --> 01:59:43,156
No.

2221
01:59:44,247 --> 01:59:45,692
Don't say that, Savitri.

2222
01:59:46,583 --> 01:59:47,960
Look, once again we're..

2223
01:59:48,585 --> 01:59:51,589
You, me and our son“
- Mine.

2224
01:59:54,324 --> 01:59:56,133
Vishwas is my son.

2225
01:59:56,393 --> 01:59:57,371
Only mine.

2226
01:59:58,995 --> 02:00:01,066
You've no relation with me.

2227
02:00:01,364 --> 02:00:03,105
I do, Savitri.

2228
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:05,170
We share blood ties.

2229
02:00:06,803 --> 02:00:11,149
And even you can't change that.

2230
02:00:33,363 --> 02:00:35,434
You've the bag, Gundappa sir.

2231
02:00:36,433 --> 02:00:38,106
You can punish me in any way you want.

2232
02:00:39,035 --> 02:00:40,070
But let my mother go.

2233
02:00:40,137 --> 02:00:42,174
First let us complete our mission.

2234
02:00:42,672 --> 02:00:44,913
Mission White Elephant.

2235
02:00:46,109 --> 02:00:49,488
This bag contains
a computerized detonator.

2236
02:00:50,647 --> 02:00:53,093
Once it's connected
with our computer..

2237
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:57,095
...It will trigger numerous
blasts in the city.

2238
02:00:57,420 --> 02:00:59,593
And people will rot to death.

2239
02:01:00,157 --> 02:01:01,261
Rot to death!

2240
02:01:07,998 --> 02:01:08,499
Yes.

2241
02:01:08,565 --> 02:01:10,476
Take a left after one kilometre.

2242
02:01:29,085 --> 02:01:30,723
Take a right after three kilometres.

2243
02:01:48,004 --> 02:01:51,542
Sir. I've set the timer
for the bio-chemical weapon.

2244
02:01:51,608 --> 02:01:54,248
I've the set the timer to 20 minutes.

2245
02:01:54,311 --> 02:01:57,190
All the bombs will
explode in 20 minutes.

2246
02:02:14,998 --> 02:02:16,204
What happened to the tracker?

2247
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:18,011
Just a minute, stop!

2248
02:02:19,035 --> 02:02:20,036
You informed the police.

2249
02:02:20,103 --> 02:02:23,277
Now you and your mother
will have to die, Vishwasl

2250
02:02:24,407 --> 02:02:26,284
No one moves.

2251
02:02:26,343 --> 02:02:27,720
Or I will shoot.

2252
02:02:28,144 --> 02:02:29,452
Shoot me.

2253
02:02:31,214 --> 02:02:32,716
Don't move.

2254
02:02:32,782 --> 02:02:33,692
I said...

2255
02:02:34,484 --> 02:02:35,622
I will shoot.

2256
02:02:35,685 --> 02:02:36,993
Shoot me.

2257
02:02:38,321 --> 02:02:40,927
That's the punishment
for a sinner like me..

2258
02:02:41,958 --> 02:02:43,266
“That I die“

2259
02:02:45,562 --> 02:02:47,064
...by the hands of my son.

2260
02:02:47,130 --> 02:02:48,370
What is this nonsense?

2261
02:02:48,431 --> 02:02:49,671
Fate“

2262
02:02:51,268 --> 02:02:53,145
“has played a joke on me, son.

2263
02:02:54,471 --> 02:02:55,449
In-

2264
02:02:57,374 --> 02:02:59,684
SavitrL.
- Don't utter my mom's name.

2265
02:03:02,112 --> 02:03:05,491
My father died when I was a kid.
- That was a charade.

2266
02:03:07,450 --> 02:03:10,226
I can't believe my eyes either.

2267
02:03:13,456 --> 02:03:14,992
After all these years“

2268
02:03:18,161 --> 02:03:19,572
Ghorpade.
- Sir.

2269
02:03:20,463 --> 02:03:21,965
Switch on the monitor.

2270
02:03:23,733 --> 02:03:27,078
"You're still alive "

2271
02:03:27,504 --> 02:03:29,006
"That means...

2272
02:03:31,541 --> 02:03:33,077
...Vishwas.."

2273
02:03:36,112 --> 02:03:38,956
"I searched...

2274
02:03:40,050 --> 02:03:41,393
...everywhere for you, Savitri."

2275
02:03:49,092 --> 02:03:50,969
Give me a hug, son.

2276
02:03:54,431 --> 02:03:56,001
I've yearned so long for this.

2277
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:58,477
I don't want anything else.

2278
02:03:59,502 --> 02:04:01,243
Just stop the police.

2279
02:04:02,205 --> 02:04:05,914
I will go with you
and surrender myself.

2280
02:04:06,977 --> 02:04:08,354
So that you become famous.

2281
02:04:09,012 --> 02:04:10,423
My son becomes famous.

2282
02:04:12,015 --> 02:04:13,050
That's my request.

2283
02:04:13,116 --> 02:04:13,924
That's all.

2284
02:04:17,587 --> 02:04:19,225
I want additional forces.

2285
02:04:19,289 --> 02:04:20,996
Send the backup immediately.

2286
02:04:21,558 --> 02:04:22,502
Vishwas.

2287
02:04:23,326 --> 02:04:24,498
Yes, Vishwas.

2288
02:04:26,096 --> 02:04:28,508
Sir, Napoleon's ready
to surrender. - What?

2289
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:31,943
Stay there.

2290
02:04:33,236 --> 02:04:34,544
I'm bringing him to you.

2291
02:04:35,171 --> 02:04:36,115
OK.

2292
02:04:38,641 --> 02:04:41,178
Thank you, son.

2293
02:04:42,746 --> 02:04:46,660
L...missed you a lot, father.

2294
02:04:48,718 --> 02:04:51,198
Why did you leave me?

2295
02:04:53,256 --> 02:04:54,462
I am sorry, son.

2296
02:04:54,524 --> 02:04:57,232
I am sorry, I made a big mistake.

2297
02:04:57,293 --> 02:04:59,534
I made a big mistake.

2298
02:05:03,166 --> 02:05:05,305
Sir, you're a fantastic actor.

2299
02:05:05,368 --> 02:05:08,110
Even I was deceived for a moment.

2300
02:05:08,171 --> 02:05:09,673
Just imagine, sir. Even me.

2301
02:05:09,739 --> 02:05:11,719
Hello, Captain.
Keep the chopper ready.

2302
02:05:11,775 --> 02:05:12,719
I'm arriving in an hour.
- OK.

2303
02:05:12,776 --> 02:05:14,016
Right now.

2304
02:05:14,411 --> 02:05:15,617
Get ready to leave.
- Yes, sir.

2305
02:05:15,678 --> 02:05:17,385
Gundappa.
- I am coming.

2306
02:05:18,148 --> 02:05:19,422
In-

2307
02:05:21,484 --> 02:05:22,792
What's wrong with him?

2308
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:25,725
Sir, there's another one there.

2309
02:05:28,725 --> 02:05:31,001
Sir, there another one.

2310
02:05:39,069 --> 02:05:40,742
Hey girl. What are you doing?

2311
02:05:41,037 --> 02:05:42,277
Nothing much.

2312
02:05:42,338 --> 02:05:44,079
I just deactivated all the bombs“

2313
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:46,711
...that Gundappa sir had activated.

2314
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:49,422
That's it.
- How did she come out?

2315
02:05:50,246 --> 02:05:53,352
I brought her out, papa.
For helping me.

2316
02:05:53,416 --> 02:05:55,259
But, I..

2317
02:05:56,386 --> 02:05:57,387
Vishwas?

2318
02:05:57,454 --> 02:06:01,129
You might be my father“

2319
02:06:01,191 --> 02:06:04,229
...but I'm a better actor than you.

2320
02:06:05,762 --> 02:06:08,675
You put up a charade“

2321
02:06:08,731 --> 02:06:12,201
...so that you can cause
blasts in the city and flee.

2322
02:06:12,268 --> 02:06:14,145
And I put up a charade, so that“

2323
02:06:14,204 --> 02:06:18,619
...I can stop the blasts
and apprehend everyone.

2324
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:23,152
So, Napoleon. How was it?

2325
02:06:23,213 --> 02:06:24,658
Cool!

2326
02:06:28,151 --> 02:06:29,653
You won't survive either, son.

2327
02:06:29,719 --> 02:06:31,289
Hands up! Don't move.

2328
02:06:33,490 --> 02:06:35,333
Throw down your weapons.

2329
02:06:35,391 --> 02:06:37,132
We already did, sir.
- What?

2330
02:06:37,193 --> 02:06:39,264
You already did?
- I made them do it, sir.

2331
02:06:39,562 --> 02:06:40,472
Very good, Vishwas.

2332
02:06:40,530 --> 02:06:41,941
Very, very good.

2333
02:06:42,532 --> 02:06:44,136
Very, very bad.

2334
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:45,736
Because I still have my weapon.

2335
02:06:45,802 --> 02:06:48,180
Come on, Commissioner.
Throw down your weapon.

2336
02:06:48,805 --> 02:06:50,307
Throw it.

2337
02:06:51,741 --> 02:06:55,245
And, Vishwas. Throw down your gun too.

2338
02:06:56,613 --> 02:06:58,320
Very good, Gundappa.

2339
02:06:58,781 --> 02:07:00,089
Very good.
- You see, sir.

2340
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:02,152
This commissioner's
always out to get me.

2341
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:31,681
Hang on.
- What happened?

2342
02:07:33,283 --> 02:07:35,229
Take this. Take this.

2343
02:08:21,264 --> 02:08:23,505
Save me!

2344
02:08:31,107 --> 02:08:33,383

You dare hit a policeman.

2349
02:08:55,431 --> 02:08:56,569
What are you doing, idiot?

2350
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:58,640
Are you crazy?

2351
02:09:00,136 --> 02:09:01,581
What are you doing?

2352
02:09:25,628 --> 02:09:28,336
Oh my! Do you want to kill me?

Do you know what a hero
earns at the end of the day?

2435
02:16:42,098 --> 02:16:44,738
He has cars, bungalows, bank balance.

2436
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,746
And what is good
about your police job?

2437

He no longer cares about the poster.

2446

But, Yogi bhai, what about us now?

2447
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,673
