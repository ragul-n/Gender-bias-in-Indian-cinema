00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,056
Siya, what are you doing?
People will laugh at us.

2
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,358
l am going.

3
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:36,600
Sorry. Don't you want to
get your money's worth?

4
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:39,198
We don't often travel business class.

5
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,101
So what if we don't?
We have travelled by aeroplane before.

6
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:47,277
Just a minute.
What money?

7
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,203
How much did we spend on this trip?

8
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,275
We won this trip in
a lucky draw contest.

9
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,647
Thanks to me, you know.

10
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:57,945

14
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:14,670
You know, she's one of those.

Don't worry, sir.
l'll get something for her.

16
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:19,799
By the way.

17
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:24,313
Will you die if you touch meat?

18
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:26,239
Why take a chance?

19
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:29,742
Fiji, here we come.

20
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:54,870
This way.

21
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,814
What a beautiful place.

22
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,757
What are you thinking?

23
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,089
Someday l will take you to
a beautiful place like this..

24
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,061
..but on my own.

25
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:13,721
Anything free is always good..

26
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:16,358
..but if you earn it,
the feeling's amazing.

27
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,701
Vivaan.

28
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:47,920

29
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:50,260
''Your memories would
make it restless.,

30
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:54,268
''My heart doesn't listen to me.''

31
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:57,908
''There's a sweet intoxication.''

32
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,509
'Everything seems a blur.'

33
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:04,236
''My heart doesn't know a thing.''

34
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:09,777
''lt belonged to me,
but now it's a stranger.''

35

''ln my heart, like life.''

43

'Like a story.'

45
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:04,397
''That conveys from the heart.,

46

Happy anniversary, love.

65
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,578
Why are you up so early?

66
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:29,346
Was checking porn sites.

67
00:10:31,188 --> 00:10:33,019
l had applied for
a job in a few companies..

68
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,422
..Was just checking
if they've sent any response or not.

69
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:38,224
No response.

70
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:39,723
Siya.

71
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:42,361
Coffee.

72
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,129
Yeah, I was wondering.
- I will be back.

73
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,332
Vivaan.

74
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:56,342
So this is why you
disappeared yesterday.

75
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,641
Wow! You're so intelligent.

76
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:06,022
Wow! Now this
necklace looks beautiful.

77
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:08,624
They say to keep
The love alive in a marriage..

78
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,626
..two things are very important.

79
00:11:11,261 --> 00:11:13,161
Husband's defeat and..

80
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:16,394
And..

81
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,658
Diamond necklace.

82
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,194
lt's really pretty.

l absolutely love it.

84
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,139
And l love you.

85
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:27,334
Hold on.

86
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:29,072
Where did you get
the money to buy this?

87
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,146
Money? Good question.

88
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:35,651
l don't know how to steal,
l can't rob a bank.

89
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:39,382
l never win a lottery,
l don't have a job. - Vivaan.

90
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,524
You spent your savings.

91
00:11:42,726 --> 00:11:45,058
Why did you waste it on me?

92
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,057
Waste?

93
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:51,230

00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:57,296

l don't feel like going out.

113
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:55,388

00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:36,169

This is your table, ma'am.

131
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,864
Happy anniversary
Mr. and Mrs. Agasthi.

132
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:40,536
Am l dreaming?

133
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,307
This place, the ambience,
this cake, Its unreal.

134
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:46,436
l mean..

135
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:49,507
You know what?

136
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,778
These were the best
six days of my life.

137
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:55,785
And all thanks to you.

138
00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:58,421
Don't be so hasty in saying thanks.

139
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,447
The night's still young.

140
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:03,621
What's the point?
lt's our last night here.

141
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,322
And tomorrow,
back to job searches, paying EMl's.

142
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:07,829
Tension, Tension, Tension.

143
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:09,490
Just the thought of it upsets me.

144
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,560
l am 30.

145
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:13,462
lt's now or never.

146
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:16,633
l want to have my own business,
a passion in something.

147
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,566
10 years later
l don't want to regret..

148
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:21,406
..saying l could've done it back then.

149
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,277
But in search of happiness..

150
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:24,780
..l forgot to express them.

151
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,712
Happiness never depends on anyone.

152
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,920
Friends never meet coincidentally.

153
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:34,587
This moment must have some importance.

154
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:37,650
Otherwise we wouldn't
have met in the first place.

155
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:40,490
Great.

181
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,326
Thank you.
- Thank you.

182
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,494
Cheers.
- Cheers, darling.

183
00:16:56,973 --> 00:16:58,998
Come quickly, l am tasting the stars.

184
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,471
l'm impressed Mr. Vivaan.

185
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:02,807
Great.

186
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,415
You know what Don Perignon said..

187
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,474
..when he tasted this champagne?

188
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:13,719
'come quickly, l am tasting the stars.'
- Not bad.

189
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:16,849
And only a few people know this.

190
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,923
Love this.
- Yeah.

191
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:36,436
Nice paintings, Mr. Khan.

192
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:37,978
These canvases are empty.

193
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:39,675
They aren't empty, madam.

194
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,153
They're filled...
with secets I don't want to share.

195
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,049
Keep them concealed.

196
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,449
My little secrets.

197
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,689
There's another point of view,
Mr. Khan. - What?

198
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:54,388
Maybe it's filled according to
the observer's point of view.

199
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:57,825
Each time each person
sees what he thinks.

200
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:00,695
l think you don't like secrets.

201
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:03,565
Secrets are sexy.

202
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:06,435
And thoughts filthy.
- l see.

203
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,177
So what did you think?

204
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:09,979
That's a secret, Mr. Khan.

205
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,572
And secrets are sexy.

206
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:15,576
You know what.

207
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:20,120
l can't be unfair to
my 8 million viewers.

208
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:21,646
What do you mean?

209
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,455
This restaurant has a
tie-up with a website.

210
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:26,528
lt's a live gaming website.

211
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,728
And the game's called Table 21.

212
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:34,470
So, if intelligent and
beautiful people like you..

213
00:18:34,538 --> 00:18:36,733
..don't play this game,
then won't it be..

214
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:40,106
..unfair to those 8 million viewers?

215
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:43,911
What kind of game or
website are you talking about Mr. Khan?

216
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,040
lt's a live game, ma'am,
which l will play with you.

217
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:48,744
On one side of the table will be you..

218
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:49,945
..and on the other side will be me.

219
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,580
And l will ask you 8 questions.

220
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:55,557
Just a minute. What questions?

221
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:57,752
Questions related to your life.

222
00:18:58,161 --> 00:18:58,889
Okay?

223
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:01,892
And you'll be given
a task with each question.

224
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:04,229
What task?
- Task related to the question.

225
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:06,066
So, it is very simple.

226
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:09,801
8 questions, 8 answers and 8 tasks.

227
00:19:09,873 --> 00:19:13,639
But the answer will be in a yes or no.

228
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,707
Only yes or no.

229
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,508
lnteresting.

230
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,014
There must be prize money as well?

231
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:22,675
See, he's getting interested.

232
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:23,912
Of course, Mr. Vivaan. There is.

233
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:25,477
How much?
- Guess.

234
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,079
One million Fijian Dollars.

235
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:28,146
Oh, no..
- Vivaan.

236
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:29,715
No, no.

237
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,926
lt's going to be
10 million Fijian Dollars.

238
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:35,997
What?

239
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,500
You mean 21 crore rupees.

240
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,900
Women are indeed
good with calculations.

241
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:44,204
So ma'am, are you game?

242
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:52,037
Mr. Khan, this is too good
to be true? Not possible.

243
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:54,206
21 crore rupees.

244
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,144
What's the catch?

245
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:00,521
Just one.

246
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,917
You can't quit the game.

247
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:09,756
l don't mind.
- Wait.

248
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,696
Can l talk to my wife for two m inutes?

249
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:12,735
Of course.

250
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:16,966
Your wife, your decision.
Take an hour.

251
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,707
Please, please.

252
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,145
Do you know what this means?

253
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:27,979
What's the worst that can happen?

254
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:31,020
Don't know. Something seems awkward.

255
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:32,213
What can he possibly ask?

256
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:34,189
How much does he know about us?

257
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:38,591
Please.

258
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:56,672
This way.

259
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:04,677
Are they our audience?

260
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:07,286
Our audience is much bigger.

261
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,353
Bigger audience?

262
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:45,254
Table no. 21.

263
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,391
You were quick on taking
a decision, l'm happy.

264
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,166
Well you can say, Mr. Khan
we like taking our chances.

265
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:02,170
What's this?
- Nothing. Just formalities.

266
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:05,964
lt states that you're playing
this game willingly..

267
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,077
..and you will follow
all the rules of the game.

268
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,943
And you will be
given a questionnaire..

269
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,176
..and you will have to
fill in all the answers.

270
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:17,945
And one more thing,
we'll take away your personal phones.

271
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,921
And you will have our phones.

272
00:23:20,156 --> 00:23:22,181
Only incoming, no outgoing.

273
00:23:22,258 --> 00:23:25,227
Because you cannot
take anyone's help. No.

274
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:27,089
Any lifeline?
- Of course.

275
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:27,891
Just one.

276
00:23:27,964 --> 00:23:30,125
Truth, and nothing but the truth.

277
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,768
How will you know
whether we're lying or not?

278
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,000
Cameras are installed everywhere.

279
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:37,470
Lie detectors will be
tied to your wrists.

280
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:41,777
Red for wrong answer,
and green for right.

281
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:43,979
ls this lie-detector reliable?

282
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,446
l mean, after all it concerns money.

283
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:49,451
There's just one thing that can
stand between you and your money.

284
00:23:50,153 --> 00:23:52,951
Lies. Only lies.

285
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:55,949
Shall we play?

286
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:26,221
So, Mr. Vivaan. First question,
for one crore.

287
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:29,248
Ready.

288
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:33,056
ls your wife...beautiful?

289
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:36,062
ls that your first question?
- No.

290
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:41,363
l'm sure you express your
love in many different ways..

291
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:43,371
..to your beautiful wife.

292
00:24:43,907 --> 00:24:49,846
Your question is,
do you feel embarrassed..

293
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,010
..in expressing your love to
your wife in a public place?

294
00:25:06,262 --> 00:25:07,889
Yes.

295
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,092
lt's the right answer!

296
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:13,263
lt's the right answer!

297
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:15,299
Congratulations.

298
00:25:15,872 --> 00:25:17,533
That was easy.
- We won.

299
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:20,273
Congrats.
- This is unbelievable.

300
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,379
Seems like you don't believe in..

301
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:29,077
..the concept of
displaying your love openly.

302
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,211
Each one has its own choice,
Mr. Khan.

303
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:36,151
A sealed bottle is much
better than an open bar.

304
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:39,458
Right.
- lt's different in case of women.

305
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:45,298
When their lover openly
assert their right on them ..

306
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:47,359
..they really like that.

307
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,939
Right, Siyaji. Do you miss it?

308
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:52,638
Of course l do.

309
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:55,444
But he more than makes up
for it when we're alone.

310
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:57,241
Of course he must be.

311
00:25:57,313 --> 00:25:58,371
Of course.

312
00:25:58,448 --> 00:26:02,077
Mr. Vivaan. Time for your first task.

313
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:03,645
Are you ready?

314
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:06,111
Bring it on, Mr. Khan.

315
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:11,555
You will have to kiss
your wife passionately..

316
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:20,093
..in the middle of Suva's
busiest street, Rand street.

317
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,903
l knew it's going to
be something like that.

318
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,174
One crore rupees and a
beautiful task. Why not?

319
00:26:28,478 --> 00:26:30,105
l am okay with it.

320
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,546
Let's go.

321
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,450
That's the spirit my boy.

322
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:36,951
Just one more thing.

323
00:26:37,186 --> 00:26:39,984
Our referees are on
the inside as well as outside.

324
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:43,352
And there are cameras everywhere,
keeping a watch on you..

325
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:46,518
..because this game will be
telecasted live on the internet.

326
00:26:46,596 --> 00:26:48,120
Please, no cheating.

327
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,090
Gouse.

328
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:57,030
What are you thinking?

329
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,397
Let's do it.

330
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:00,134
Let's do it.

331
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,466
This is not a shoe ad.
- l'm your wife.

332
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:07,374
Look, if you can't do it
then l'll get someone else.

333
00:28:07,543 --> 00:28:09,272
Just shut up, Siya.

334
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,751
Vivaan. Vivaan, Listen.

335
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:27,359
Has it ever happened that..

336
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:32,094
..you wanted to kiss me in
public desperately but you couldn't?

337
00:29:16,512 --> 00:29:18,673
Out of all the days,
chooses to fight today.

338
00:29:18,748 --> 00:29:19,715
'Siya, it is okay. Just relax.'

339
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:21,682
ey.. Give me some rum.'

340
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:24,080
lt's not good for you.'

341
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,586
Why? What's the problem
in having a peg of rum?

342
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:29,384
I meant Bobby, not rum.

343
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:31,319
He doesn't know anything about Bobby..

344
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,292
Why is he giving me advice?

345
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:33,419
That's okay.

346
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:35,824
lf not my advice, at least the rum.

347
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:37,527
You will accept something.

348
00:29:59,388 --> 00:30:01,879
So, do you only give good advice..

349
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:03,648
..or can you dance just as well.

350
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:06,526
l can try.

351
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:14,798
l noticed that you've been
checking me out all evening.

352
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:17,237
Though you know l've a boyfriend.

353
00:30:22,645 --> 00:30:28,311
l kept staring at her,
and time flew by.

354
00:30:28,551 --> 00:30:32,544
l wonder why l couldn't
take my eyes off her face.

355
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:37,625
Like the moon and its moonlight
l kept looking at her with awe.

356
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:42,830
But never imagined that
l will get to see her so closely.

357
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:37,810
Fantastic, Mr. Vivaan.

358
00:31:37,987 --> 00:31:42,720
People say a man snatches his
first kiss, demands the second..

359
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:46,622
..takes the third, accepts the
fourth and endures the rest.

360
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:51,299
But here, it looks like this
was really your first kiss.

361
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,393
Yes. Not just me,
our viewers say the same thing.

362
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:58,536
1 .2 m illions hits on website.

363
00:31:58,608 --> 00:31:59,973
My goodness.
- Thank you, Mr. Khan.

364
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:04,370
l didn't just kiss my wife publicly..

365
00:32:04,947 --> 00:32:08,747
..today l've also been
publicly made a 'Bakra' (ffool).

366
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:11,352
Come on, guys.
Come on, come out, come out.

367
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,021
What are you doing?
- Good job, buddy, good job.

368
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:14,847
Thank you. Come out everyone.

369
00:32:14,924 --> 00:32:18,587
Mr. Vivaan, are you okay?
- Absolutely fine, Mr. Khan.

370
00:32:18,828 --> 00:32:20,955
l know, come on..
- Vivaan, what's with you?

371
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,328
Siya. Can't you get it?

372
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:26,000
This is not a game show,
this is a show.

373
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:28,667
Otherwise who pays this
much money for a kiss?

374
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,037
lsn't it, Mr. Khan?
You fooled us, didn't you? - Yes, yes.

375
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,933
Of course, you caught us.
- See, l told you.

376
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:38,811
We call it lnternational 'Bakra' now.

377
00:32:39,382 --> 00:32:41,543
Sorry, ma'am. Please don't m ind.
- l told you.

378
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:45,412
No. - We didn't know
you'll catch us so soon.

379
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:47,687
Nice meeting you.

380
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:50,789
Same here.

381
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,350
Come on, darling.
- That way, please

382
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,493
21 crore rupees.
No one gives it for free.

383
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,906
Let's play more? l told you.

384
00:33:15,418 --> 00:33:16,749
My God.

385
00:33:17,486 --> 00:33:21,718
This isn't life that staggers,
this is a game.

386
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:25,460
And this game has some rules.

387
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:31,331
The first rule says,
if you lie...you die.

388
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:33,565
But l never lie.

389
00:33:33,903 --> 00:33:36,770
This is 21 crore rupees,
minus one crore. Sorry.

390
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:39,808
lt's been transferred
to your bank account.

391
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,875
What?
- Yes.

392
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:43,773
Show him.

393
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:45,776
Show him the phone.

394
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:51,045
What does it say?

395
00:33:58,094 --> 00:34:01,757
Amount of Rs. 1 Cr credited
to your account. - Yes.

396
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:05,625
l am so sorry we doubted you,
Mr. Khan.

397
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,868
What's the next question?
- Are you hungry?

398
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:21,507
Mr. Vivaan, do you feel you
know your wife completely?

399
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:23,875
That's a difficult question,
Mr. Khan.

400
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:31,485
Obviously, yes.
- No, don't look at the buzzer.

401
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:33,729
l just wanted your opinion.

402
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:36,621
The question is foe Siya.

403
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:42,432
The second question is for Siya,
for Two Cr. Rupees.

404
00:34:42,972 --> 00:34:49,673
Do you feel...
your husband knows you completely?

405
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:00,717
What?

406
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:06,722
Are you..

407
00:35:08,597 --> 00:35:10,462
No.
- What?

408
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,861
No!

409
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,603
lt's the right answer.

410
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,607
Absolutely right.

411
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,139
Superb.
- Okay.

412
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:24,679
Siya, superb.
- lt's okay.

413
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,772
Well played. Wow.

414
00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:30,017
Mr. Vivaan, you don't know that
your wife knows..

415
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:33,987
..that you don't know her completely.

416
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,888
Confused, right?

417
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:39,824
Mr. Khan, every woman wants her man..

418
00:35:39,895 --> 00:35:41,453
..to think of her like a closed fist.

419
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:45,599
But actually,
every woman is very predictable.

420
00:35:46,202 --> 00:35:47,760
Like an open book.

421
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,131
But closed fists are very interesting.

422
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:52,800
And open books are beautiful, right?

423
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:56,471
So the question is, Mr. Vivaan..

424
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:59,912
..whether your wife's
interesting or beautiful.

425
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,608
We'll decide that as well.

426
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:05,245
After this dare for one crore.

427
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:11,215
Can your predictable wife...eat this?

428
00:36:20,269 --> 00:36:22,032
l must admit, Mr. Khan.

429
00:36:22,538 --> 00:36:25,507
That's a good idea to save your money.

430
00:36:27,877 --> 00:36:29,139
We lose.

431
00:36:29,211 --> 00:36:30,701
lt's okay, relax.
- Mr. Vivaan.

432
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:34,145
Two crores are at stake here.

433
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,281
Two crores.

434
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:38,713
People can die for this amount.

435
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:43,657
And not many get this amount
even after all the apathy.

436
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:49,724
Mr. Khan, my wife might
think that l don't know her.

437
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:52,264
..but l do know her this much.

438
00:36:52,902 --> 00:36:54,699
We've been married for 5 years.

439
00:36:55,204 --> 00:36:57,968
She'd rather take poison but not this.

440
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:00,539
Never.

441
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:14,981
This is a beautiful game,
Mr. Vivaan.

442
00:37:15,157 --> 00:37:19,685
Now you know that you
don't know anything.

443
00:37:19,995 --> 00:37:24,796
And to know that
you don't know is very important.

444
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:29,031
You've your entire life to
know and understand each other.

445
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:32,239
Siya, all okay.

446
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,979
Are you expecting a good news.

447
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:41,710
Winning 2 crore.
lsn't that good news.

448
00:38:01,036 --> 00:38:02,367
l am fine, Vivaan.

449
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:04,204
Thanks for asking.

450
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,171
Did you ask?

451
00:38:07,176 --> 00:38:09,201
l didn't hear you.

452
00:38:12,948 --> 00:38:14,813
Siya. Siya.

453
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:23,283
Close your eyes, and imagine
that you've won 21 crores.

454
00:38:23,993 --> 00:38:27,053
Now, how will you spend this money?

455
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,967
That's it.

456
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:38,268
Your sm ile has said everything.

457
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,671
That's it.

458
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:40,902
You know, Mr. Khan.

459
00:38:40,976 --> 00:38:43,945
Whoever said
money can't buy happiness..

460
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,808
..didn't know where to shop.

461
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:48,806
Yes, one can buy everything,
of course.

462
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:50,747
But not his past.

463
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:52,977
He cannot buy his past.

464
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:55,888
He can't buy it,
but he can forget it.

465
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:57,993
That's the power of money.

466
00:38:58,193 --> 00:39:01,026
Yeah, it can make
a person do anything.

467
00:39:02,197 --> 00:39:06,065
So...next question for three crores.

468
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:08,292
For you, Mr. Vivaan

469
00:39:08,937 --> 00:39:12,839
Have you ever manipulated anyone?

470
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:16,108
Manipulate? What do you mean?

471
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:18,203
ln local term, making a fool.

472
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:21,443
Mr. Khan, to be successful in life..

473
00:39:21,717 --> 00:39:24,083
..one has to be as well as
get what you just said.

474
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,415
l don't want clarification,
just the answer.

475
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:27,121
Just yes or no.

476
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:37,291
'T here he is.'

477
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:40,001
'Forget it.
- Go on, tell him.'

478
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:42,360
'Bobby. This is Vivaan.'

479
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:44,338
e wanted to talk to you.'

480
00:39:45,107 --> 00:39:45,971
'Y ou leave.'

481
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:47,338
'l had something to confess.'

482
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:49,104
'T he other night at
the Christmas party..

483
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,475
..that's where Siya and
l met for the first time.'

484
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:52,008
'Nothing, we just had a few drinks.'

485
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:53,309
'T he dance floor turned
into a badminton court.'

486
00:39:53,382 --> 00:39:54,474
'She was the shuttlecock
and l was the racquet.'

487
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,718
'She spun me here, twisted me there.'

488
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:57,944
'T he music was really loud.'

489
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,951
'I kept hitting the shots,
and she kept getting smashed.'

490
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,422
'Slowly the passion
between increased..'

491
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:05,085
'. .and only the cock was
left from the shuttlecock.'

492
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,821
'Dude, I slept with your
girlfriend Siya that night.

493
00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:08,453
'W hat?
- Yeah.'

494
00:40:08,897 --> 00:40:10,831
'l mean l'm sorry.
- Dam n man..'

495
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:12,833
'I am sorry, it just..
- Bibby.'

496
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:15,432
i.
- Hi, Siya. Nice to meet you.'

497
00:40:15,504 --> 00:40:16,835
'Y ou know him?'

498
00:40:16,905 --> 00:40:17,872
'W e met at the Christmas
party and had a few drinks..'

499
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,408
'Siya, l told Bobby everything.'

500
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,074
What the..'

501
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,905
'Freakin' rascal.
- Yeah.'

502
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,410
'Bobby, very rude of you.'

503
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:29,508
itting a girl.'

504
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:31,848
Are you fine, Siya?
- Dam n him.'

505
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,955
'Siya.'

506
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,987
Siya. Are you okay?

507
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,788
'W hat do you boys think of yourself?'

508
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:40,394
'l know that was really rude of him .'

509
00:40:40,462 --> 00:40:42,453
'l mean what's happening?
What did you tell him?

510
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:45,460
Me? lt wasn't me,
it was that Amar from first year.'

511
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,199
At the Christmas party
he saw us dancing together..'

512
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:48,531
'. .and told Bobby about it.'

513
00:40:48,804 --> 00:40:50,169
'Bobby got angry at me.'

514
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:54,238
'A ll l told Bobby was just because
Siya and l had a few drinks together..

515
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:55,901
'. .sang a song, danced together..'

516
00:40:55,978 --> 00:40:57,536
'. .we shared a laugh together,
it wasn't anything wrong.

517
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,108
'But he got really angry.'

518
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,772
'A nd you know what
happened after that.'

519
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:06,948
l told you Bobby is not right for you.

520
00:41:08,957 --> 00:41:10,219
'Il am .'I

521
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,127
Great. Another green.

522
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:16,528
Absolutely right answer.

523
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:22,200
So your task is that
you manipulate me.

524
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:25,100
Don't be alarmed.

525
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,333
Look, l'm sharp, intelligent..

526
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:30,308
..and l've 55 years of experience.

527
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:33,177
And it's not easy to
fool someone like me.

528
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:35,808
And anyway, no one pays
three crores for an easy task.

529
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:39,915
So your task is that
you manipulate me.

530
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:45,283
Mr. Khan, how can
l manipulate just like that?

531
00:41:45,594 --> 00:41:47,027
Give me a situation.

532
00:41:48,163 --> 00:41:51,098
Okay. How's this. l'm standing here.

533
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:54,235
Now com pel me to go there.

534
00:41:56,505 --> 00:41:58,302
Mr. Khan, l am no magician.

535
00:42:00,075 --> 00:42:01,872
l'm sorry but l cannot do this.

536
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,437
l cannot do it.

537
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:05,573
But yes, if you were standing there..

538
00:42:05,848 --> 00:42:07,315
..l would've told you three words..

539
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:09,942
..that would've compelled
you to come here. Guaranteed.

540
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:11,918
What?

541
00:42:12,588 --> 00:42:14,146
l don't think so.

542
00:42:14,423 --> 00:42:17,256
Of course l can do it. l trust myself.

543
00:42:17,426 --> 00:42:18,188
First go there.

544
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:19,450
Okay.

545
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:22,160
What are you doing?

546
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,328
Here l am.

547
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,337
Say those three words Mr. Vivaan.

548
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:34,905
Vivaan,

549
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:40,244
Mr. Khan, you're sharp, intelligent..

550
00:42:40,315 --> 00:42:43,910
..and you've 55 years of experience.

551
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:46,954
But you fell short of a little wit.

552
00:42:47,389 --> 00:42:51,189
Vivaan just
manipulated you to go there.

553
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,154
Oh!

554
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:01,092
Great.

555
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,962
Such a defeat is better than victory.

556
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,040
You've won three crores.

557
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:09,441
Siya, prepare your shopping list.

558
00:43:09,645 --> 00:43:11,135
l'll be right back.

559
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,411
Oh my, God!

560
00:43:14,182 --> 00:43:15,945
Three crores.

561
00:43:16,618 --> 00:43:18,415
lt was so easy, right.

562
00:43:18,954 --> 00:43:20,080
Didn't you feel that was strange?

563
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,287
What strange?

564
00:43:21,356 --> 00:43:24,587
Siya, l felt that Khan
wanted me to manipulate him.

565
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:27,291
For some reason.
- Why are you so irritating, Vivaan?

566
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:29,053
Just enjoy the moment.

567
00:43:29,131 --> 00:43:30,655
We just won three crores.

568
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,332
Are you two quarrelling?

569
00:43:33,502 --> 00:43:35,026
Will we get one crore for the answer?

570
00:43:35,103 --> 00:43:37,071
Only for the right answer.

571
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:40,167
Of course, how can l forget.
- Now. Next question.

572
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:46,978
By the way, Vivaan,
do you believe in God?

573
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:48,980
Of course.
- That's a lie.

574
00:43:49,284 --> 00:43:52,412
You don't believe in Him,
you fear Him.

575
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:54,051
You can say that.

576
00:43:54,189 --> 00:43:58,523
Fear exists in every nook
and corner of the world..

577
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:00,986
..and in every corner of the heart.

578
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,364
The world runs on fear.

579
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,595
Come on.

580
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,976
And the thing is, Mr. Vivaan.

581
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:23,040
When fear comes in the way of love..

582
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,678
..life becomes interesting.

583
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:27,986
So, Mr. Vivaan.

584
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,126
What can you do to face your fears?

585
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:35,155
Depends, what's at stake?

586
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:39,056
Your love.
- What?

587
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,270
Yes.

588
00:44:42,337 --> 00:44:44,328
The question for four crores is..

589
00:44:44,539 --> 00:44:50,341
..can you face any
fear to save your love?

590
00:44:59,654 --> 00:45:00,621
Yes.

591
00:45:00,689 --> 00:45:02,384
lt's the right answer.

592
00:45:03,658 --> 00:45:05,216
Time for some action.

593
00:45:11,466 --> 00:45:14,094
Come in, it's a part of the game.

594
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,329
Come on.

595
00:45:20,742 --> 00:45:23,802
And now you will
face your biggest fear.

596
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,239
Are you ready?

597
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:28,212
How do you know what
my biggest fear is?

598
00:45:28,283 --> 00:45:30,547
Consider that l know, Mr. Vivaan.

599
00:45:30,752 --> 00:45:32,720
And now you will know too.

600
00:45:33,388 --> 00:45:35,253
Very soon.

601
00:45:37,426 --> 00:45:38,757
What is our task?

602
00:45:39,561 --> 00:45:43,122
Your task is Mr. Vivaan..

603
00:45:44,232 --> 00:45:47,724
This key is niw locked in this lock.

604
00:45:48,637 --> 00:45:51,504
This key will be released only when..

605
00:45:51,573 --> 00:45:56,408
..you fill this bottle
with 250 ml of blood.

606
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:57,672
Blood?

607
00:45:57,813 --> 00:45:59,303
.25 litres of blood.

608
00:45:59,848 --> 00:46:00,837
Whose blood?

609
00:46:01,116 --> 00:46:02,845
Your wife, your blood.

610
00:46:03,118 --> 00:46:04,312
Simple!

611
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:08,351
'T his is our final year.'

612
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,453
What do you plan to do after that?

613
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,620
Marriage.

614
00:46:16,798 --> 00:46:17,856
'W ith whom?'

615
00:46:18,467 --> 00:46:19,559
Siya. Come soon.
- You are sitting here.

616
00:46:19,634 --> 00:46:20,794
l want to show you something.
- Vivaan. Come quickly.

617
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:23,337
Come quickly.
- For what?

618
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,370
Tell me.

619
00:46:29,544 --> 00:46:30,511
Look.

620
00:46:31,713 --> 00:46:33,840
What are you up to?
- Good.

621
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:37,240
No, no. lt's a trap. For Akram.

622
00:46:37,652 --> 00:46:39,643
Look. Look.

623
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:42,656
Whose idea was it?

624
00:46:47,729 --> 00:46:49,560
Oh my, God.

625
00:47:03,578 --> 00:47:04,306
Vivaan.

626
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:05,471
Bittu, water.

627
00:47:05,547 --> 00:47:07,174
Bring a chair. Vivaan, are you okay?

628
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:12,720
Mr. Vivaan, Vivaan,
where are you lost?

629
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:15,621
l forgot to tell you.

630
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,352
There's only seven
minutes of oxygen in there.

631
00:47:18,426 --> 00:47:20,792
Only seven minutes.

632
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,792
Siya.

633
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:25,223
What kind of a joke is this?

634
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,267
Get her out.

635
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:28,199
lt's your job to get her out.

636
00:47:28,837 --> 00:47:32,432
You give me blood and
l will give you freedom.

637
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,199
Simple.

638
00:47:34,943 --> 00:47:36,706
Timer is on, Mr. Vivaan.

639
00:47:37,345 --> 00:47:39,245
30 seconds have already passed.

640
00:47:39,414 --> 00:47:40,540
Quick.

641
00:48:34,769 --> 00:48:35,929
Bingo.

642
00:49:17,512 --> 00:49:18,740
Great.

643
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:46,506
More.

644
00:50:10,899 --> 00:50:11,831
Come on.

645
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,133
Siya!
- Superb!

646
00:50:47,402 --> 00:50:49,097
Superb, Mr. Vivaan!

647
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,701
You've won four crores.

648
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,808
Congrats.
- Mr. Khan, Sia ran out of oxygen.

649
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,771
What if she had met with an accident?

650
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,540
Accidents only happen in real life,
Mr. Vivaan.

651
00:50:58,713 --> 00:51:00,112
Games only have rules.

652
00:51:00,648 --> 00:51:02,741
And this game has just one rule.

653
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:06,910
You will only die, if you lie.

654
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:16,422
''These silky tresses.
These exhilarating eyes.''

655
00:51:16,831 --> 00:51:20,426
'You're the reason I'm still alive.'

656
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,033
Beautiful.

657
00:51:24,038 --> 00:51:27,906
What did you think, Mr. Vivaan,
l was praising your wife.

658
00:51:29,611 --> 00:51:33,411
You're right, l was praising her.

659
00:51:33,948 --> 00:51:35,540
And why wouldn't l?

660
00:51:35,683 --> 00:51:37,116
That's how Siya is.

661
00:51:37,585 --> 00:51:39,985
Beautiful. Gorgeous.

662
00:51:40,155 --> 00:51:41,679
lntelligent.

663
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:45,958
Stable. Com passionate.

664
00:51:46,428 --> 00:51:49,886
And.. - And she's my wife so
l know everything about her.

665
00:51:50,098 --> 00:51:51,087
Tell me something else.

666
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:52,963
You seem to be upset, Mr. Vivaan.

667
00:51:53,535 --> 00:51:56,561
Actually l was hinting
towards the fifth question.

668
00:51:56,805 --> 00:51:58,966
Now, Siya.
Next question for five crores.

669
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,029
For you.

670
00:52:00,508 --> 00:52:04,467
Do you feel that if you
didn't have any hair..

671
00:52:04,612 --> 00:52:09,447
..your husband will still
love you as much as he does now?

672
00:52:10,652 --> 00:52:11,550
Yes.

673
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:13,450
Lovely. The buzzer's
showed green as well.

674
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:15,614
Lovely, Siya.

675
00:52:16,057 --> 00:52:18,685
Now. Your task is that..

676
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,622
..You've to give me all yor hair.

677
00:52:22,564 --> 00:52:23,758
What nonsense?

678
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:27,131
Nonsense? lt's com mon sense.

679
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:32,006
When the husband's jobless,
every penny counts.

680
00:52:32,207 --> 00:52:32,798
Right?

681
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,569
And this is a
question for five crores.

682
00:52:35,877 --> 00:52:38,607
Look, your hair will grow back again..

683
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,774
..but not this opportunity.

684
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:44,214
No, no, enough Mr Khan.
This is enough.

685
00:52:45,053 --> 00:52:46,714
Let's do it, Siya.

686
00:52:47,655 --> 00:52:49,054
What are you saying, Vivaan?

687
00:52:49,524 --> 00:52:51,219
l am not going to cut my hair.

688
00:52:51,693 --> 00:52:53,217
Will you do anything for money?

689
00:52:53,495 --> 00:52:55,087
Siya, it's just a task.

690
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,697
We'll have to do it.

691
00:52:56,831 --> 00:52:58,264
Didn't you eat meat?

692
00:52:58,533 --> 00:52:59,966
Did you ever eat it before?

693
00:53:00,034 --> 00:53:01,558
So what's the problem
in cutting your hair?

694
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:05,239
And anyway, the sooner
we get out of here, the better.

695
00:53:05,507 --> 00:53:06,769
So, let's do it.

696
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:08,172
He has a point, Siya.

697
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:11,738
Fine, cut it.

698
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,041
Have it your way.

699
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:16,948
Okay, don't get disturbed okay.

700
00:53:17,018 --> 00:53:19,145
A change of plan here. Siya.

701
00:53:19,721 --> 00:53:22,019
You won't cut your hair.

702
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,751
Relax. Fine.

703
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:26,819
Vivaan, You will cut it.

704
00:53:27,896 --> 00:53:29,796
Okay? Fine.

705
00:53:31,065 --> 00:53:32,657
Get it.

706
00:53:34,536 --> 00:53:35,867
What's that? That's not..

707
00:53:35,937 --> 00:53:38,030
No, no, no, no. He won't do that.

708
00:53:39,274 --> 00:53:40,764
What's this?
- Razor.

709
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:42,171
l know that.

710
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,835
Buy you asked me to cut
her hair, not shave it.

711
00:53:45,046 --> 00:53:47,879
l said l want all the hair, right?

712
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:52,013
Fine. We don't want
to play this question.

713
00:53:52,153 --> 00:53:53,552
Next question please.

714
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:57,079
Mr. Vivaan, you know you've
to answer all the questions..

715
00:53:57,158 --> 00:53:59,592
..and complete the tasks given to you.

716
00:53:59,661 --> 00:54:01,128
That;s it.
- Then we quit this game.

717
00:54:01,663 --> 00:54:03,096
That's enough.

718
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:05,597
Come on, Siya.

719
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,161
He's messed up mind..
- And the 21 crores?

720
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:11,663
To hell with it.

721
00:54:13,575 --> 00:54:15,600
Alright, Mr. Vivaan, you can leave.

722
00:54:15,944 --> 00:54:17,571
l won't stop you.

723
00:54:17,845 --> 00:54:20,871
But remember that the world is round.

724
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:21,912
Gouse.

725
00:54:48,209 --> 00:54:49,836
Oh no!

726
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:52,737
l can't believe that
we listened to him.

727
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:55,112
That game was getting too weird.

728
00:54:55,283 --> 00:54:56,841
Weird.

729
00:54:57,318 --> 00:55:01,118
l think that man's a psycho or insane.

730
00:55:01,389 --> 00:55:02,754
And what was wrong with you?

731
00:55:02,824 --> 00:55:04,382
l mean, you were
willing to cut my hair.

732
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:06,657
You wouldn't look too bad without it.

733
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,054
Shut up.

734
00:55:12,066 --> 00:55:13,795
Show me.
- What's this?

735
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:17,829
Why is it beeping?
- Let me check.

736
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,964
We forgot to take these off?

737
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:23,408
Mr. Vivaan.. Don't go further
than 10 kilometres..

738
00:55:23,678 --> 00:55:26,704
Otherwise it can explode. Be careful.

739
00:55:27,015 --> 00:55:28,277
What?

740
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:33,315
The further you go,
your life will be in danger.

741
00:55:33,888 --> 00:55:34,320
Mr. Vivaan.

742
00:55:34,389 --> 00:55:36,414
No point in looking here
and there, do something.

743
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:37,783
What nonsense!

744
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:41,090
Come back. Come back.

745
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,962
Hello. Hello.

746
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,690
Damn it.

747
00:55:48,202 --> 00:55:49,897
Where is he watching us from?

748
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,404
Do something, please.

749
00:56:00,081 --> 00:56:01,378
Turn back!

750
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,176
Turn back now!

751
00:56:03,685 --> 00:56:05,050
Turn it now!

752
00:56:28,042 --> 00:56:28,940
Move.

753
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,309
Khan! Khan! Khan!
- Slowly. Slowly.

754
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,780
What is this joke?
- Calm down!

755
00:56:34,949 --> 00:56:36,940
Slowly. The birds are sleeping.

756
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,076
People are watching you.

757
00:56:38,152 --> 00:56:40,950
l don't care. Take this off.

758
00:56:41,255 --> 00:56:43,780
There're only two ways
to do that, Mr. Vivaan.

759
00:56:44,092 --> 00:56:45,923
First, complete the game.

760
00:56:46,094 --> 00:56:48,085
Or severe your arm ,
and it will automatically come off.

761
00:56:48,162 --> 00:56:52,223
This isn't a game, it's illegal
- Against the law?

762
00:56:56,304 --> 00:56:59,034
Here's your signed contract, madam..

763
00:56:59,507 --> 00:57:03,170
..where you've enslaved
your freedom to this game.

764
00:57:03,745 --> 00:57:05,212
To hell with the law.

765
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,974
Who cares about the law.

766
00:57:07,415 --> 00:57:11,374
There's a law in Texas,
That you can't make furniture nude.

767
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,920
And in Portugal,
you can't pee in the sea.

768
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,454
And in Minnesota, the law is that..

769
00:57:18,526 --> 00:57:21,359
..the husband and wife
cannot dry their underwear..

770
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:23,397
..on the same rope.

771
00:57:23,464 --> 00:57:25,159
And which is the country..

772
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:29,294
..where you can't make ugly
faces in front of your dog.

773
00:57:29,771 --> 00:57:31,466
Laws are a sham, it's hollow.

774
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:34,064
What is strong are principles.

775
00:57:34,142 --> 00:57:36,269
And compelling
someone to do something..

776
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:37,834
..are those your principles?

777
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,174
Demand.

778
00:57:39,413 --> 00:57:41,176
Demand. Of the game, not mine.

779
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,807
Demand of the website.

780
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,812
Look, you were playing,
people were enjoying..

781
00:57:46,888 --> 00:57:49,413
..now that you're fighting,
the people are loving it more.

782
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:50,388
Really.

783
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:54,487
8 million people are watching.

784
00:57:55,062 --> 00:57:58,998
They're waiting for the decision,
which you've to take.

785
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:03,266
Your hair or your arms.

786
01:00:23,744 --> 01:00:25,439
Nice job.

787
01:00:26,447 --> 01:00:30,349
Siya. You look very different.

788
01:00:35,523 --> 01:00:37,457
Look, if you had shaved off
your hair in the temple..

789
01:00:37,525 --> 01:00:39,083
..you would've earned merits.

790
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,455
Here you won money.

791
01:00:42,063 --> 01:00:44,327
And five crores is a big amount.

792
01:00:44,632 --> 01:00:45,826
You can give away some in charity..

793
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,567
..that way you will
also earn some merits.

794
01:00:47,835 --> 01:00:49,097
Right?

795
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,331
So now. Next question.

796
01:00:51,472 --> 01:00:53,736
For six crores. For you.

797
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:58,805
We just saw that
you love your wife a lot.

798
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,104
Right.

799
01:01:00,181 --> 01:01:05,346
Now our viewers want to know
what they didn't see.

800
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,551
Yes.

801
01:01:08,689 --> 01:01:14,127
Did you ever...slap your wife?

802
01:01:14,328 --> 01:01:15,693
Domestic violence.

803
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:26,237
ow could you be such a bitch, Siya?'

804
01:01:28,843 --> 01:01:31,812
'Don't call me that, Vivaan.
- l will.'

805
01:01:36,117 --> 01:01:40,451
'T hat was my child, Siya.
- Our child, Vivaan.'

806
01:01:40,755 --> 01:01:44,851
'A nd you killed it. You killed it.'

807
01:01:45,192 --> 01:01:46,682
'W e were not ready.'

808
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:51,860
'Siya, if that was our child,
then it should've been our decision..'

809
01:01:52,133 --> 01:01:53,725
'. .and not yours alone.'

810
01:02:02,143 --> 01:02:03,371
'I am sorry, Vivaan.'

811
01:02:04,245 --> 01:02:07,476
'Y ou would've never agreed
if l had told you.'

812
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,817
'Just think about it.'

813
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:14,416
'W e cannot take the responsibility of
a child right now.'

814
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:17,687
'Neither emotionally nor financially.'

815
01:02:18,826 --> 01:02:21,294
'A nd it's not over yet.'

816
01:02:22,596 --> 01:02:24,791
'W e can plan a child.'

817
01:02:28,569 --> 01:02:30,833
'lt's not the end of the world.'

818
01:02:33,507 --> 01:02:34,804
'lt's okay.'

819
01:02:39,647 --> 01:02:41,376
'lt's not okay.'
- Mr. Vivaan.

820
01:02:41,782 --> 01:02:44,342
Mr. Vivaan. What had happened?

821
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,215
Your contract doesn't say that..

822
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:49,950
..we've to answer all your questions.

823
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,583
You're getting emotional.

824
01:02:53,194 --> 01:02:56,459
But it must've been something serious.

825
01:02:56,931 --> 01:02:59,297
l am such a 'Gossip Girl'.

826
01:03:00,301 --> 01:03:02,792
So, Gandhiji had said..

827
01:03:03,337 --> 01:03:07,364
..an eye for an eye,
will make the whole world blind.

828
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:09,839
But l say a hit for a hit..

829
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:13,270
..will give my website
millions of hits.

830
01:03:13,881 --> 01:03:16,679
So, your task is..

831
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:21,551
..you'll have to
let your wife slap you.

832
01:03:21,922 --> 01:03:23,583
Yes.

833
01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:28,295
Siya. Come on, take off your glove..

834
01:03:28,362 --> 01:03:31,695
..and give a tight slap
across your husband's face.

835
01:03:33,234 --> 01:03:34,599
Come on.

836
01:03:48,716 --> 01:03:50,877
Siya. Siya. Siya.

837
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,877
A slap should be crisp.

838
01:03:52,953 --> 01:03:55,251
lt's no fun as long
it's not a tight one.

839
01:03:55,422 --> 01:03:56,320
Look here.

840
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:59,518
This metre will decide how loud
and hard you slap him.

841
01:04:02,963 --> 01:04:04,863
See. 120.

842
01:04:04,932 --> 01:04:07,332
lt doesn't register below 120.

843
01:04:07,535 --> 01:04:09,435
Come on, come on.

844
01:04:18,512 --> 01:04:19,809
One more, Siya.

845
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,472
Harder, Siya.

846
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,610
One more.

847
01:04:24,685 --> 01:04:26,585
Hit him harder so that he knows..

848
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,485
..it's not easy for
a mother to abort her child.

849
01:04:28,556 --> 01:04:29,284
Hit him.

850
01:04:29,356 --> 01:04:30,914
'W hat had happened?

851
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:32,583
'Y our contract doesn't say that..'

852
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,922
'. .we've to answer
all your questions.'

853
01:04:33,994 --> 01:04:35,621
ow do you know
what my biggest fear is?'

854
01:04:35,696 --> 01:04:37,687
You give me blood,
and l will give you life.

855
01:04:37,765 --> 01:04:41,701
'W hen the husband's jobless,
every penny counts.'

856
01:04:44,038 --> 01:04:45,528
That's it.

857
01:04:45,606 --> 01:04:46,903
We got it.

858
01:04:46,974 --> 01:04:48,669
Great. That's it.

859
01:04:54,648 --> 01:04:56,946
Siya. lt's okay. lt's okay.

860
01:04:57,384 --> 01:05:01,684
Listen. This man knows
a lot about us..

861
01:05:02,489 --> 01:05:05,515
..which we neither told him
or wrote on the form.

862
01:05:06,026 --> 01:05:07,994
Your abortion, me losing my job.

863
01:05:08,062 --> 01:05:09,552
My phobia of blood.

864
01:05:09,964 --> 01:05:11,397
How does he know all this?

865
01:05:11,465 --> 01:05:14,866
''Wooden plank, a horse on the plank.''

866
01:05:14,935 --> 01:05:18,894
''As the hammer struck on
the back of the horse.''

867
01:05:18,973 --> 01:05:21,965
''The horse galloped
with it's tail between his legs.''

868
01:05:28,082 --> 01:05:29,549
Yes, Mr. Vivaan.

869
01:05:29,617 --> 01:05:31,517
Seventh question, for you.

870
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:36,017
Have you ever harmed
a stranger without a reason?

871
01:05:39,426 --> 01:05:39,892
Yes.

872
01:07:13,721 --> 01:07:17,122
Hey. What the hell
are you doing to my car?

873
01:07:26,066 --> 01:07:28,933
Listen. Listen to me.

874
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,231
Get him.

875
01:07:31,939 --> 01:07:33,531
Listen to me guys.

876
01:07:34,742 --> 01:07:36,471
Please. Hear me out.

877
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,904
Hear me out once, please.

878
01:07:40,147 --> 01:07:41,910
Beat him. Beat him.

879
01:07:42,149 --> 01:07:45,016
Take him. Take him.

880
01:07:45,886 --> 01:07:47,751
ldiot.

881
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:51,687
Listen to me.

882
01:07:56,063 --> 01:07:57,587
Somebody call the cops!

883
01:07:57,664 --> 01:08:00,497
Dispatch 265 from Suva Station.

884
01:08:00,567 --> 01:08:03,536
lndian man, black shirt,
denim jeans seen breaking a car.

885
01:08:03,604 --> 01:08:05,595
All officers on alert.

886
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,033
Please help me.

887
01:08:07,107 --> 01:08:08,768
Please help me.

888
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:12,135
Back off. Back off. Step back.

889
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:13,740
l need your help.
- Back off.

890
01:08:13,814 --> 01:08:15,042
Hands behind your head.

891
01:08:15,282 --> 01:08:16,044
What have l done?

892
01:08:16,116 --> 01:08:17,014
You have to come with me.

893
01:08:17,084 --> 01:08:18,176
There's a complaint
registered against you..

894
01:08:18,252 --> 01:08:19,844
l need your help, sir.
Listen to me.

895
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,150
Me and my wife came to
Fiji for holidays few days back.

896
01:08:22,222 --> 01:08:24,019
There's a man called Khan
who trapped us.

897
01:08:24,091 --> 01:08:25,217
He's threatened to kill us.

898
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:26,554
There's no hope left.

899
01:08:26,627 --> 01:08:27,685
You're our only hope.

900
01:08:27,761 --> 01:08:29,058
Please help.

901
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:33,224
No, you've to come with me.

902
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,530
l will hear you out
in the police station.

903
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:37,863
Sir, please. Please.
- You have the right to remain silent.

904
01:08:37,938 --> 01:08:40,202
Anything you say
can be used against you.

905
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:43,209
l will register your complaint once
at the police station.

906
01:08:43,277 --> 01:08:45,302
Hey, stop. stop. - l'm sorry, sir.
l can't come with you.

907
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:46,807
l have to save my wife.

908
01:08:48,315 --> 01:08:50,249
Dispatch 223 calling for backup.

909
01:08:50,317 --> 01:08:51,716
223 calling for backup.

910
01:09:22,216 --> 01:09:24,081
Where is Siya? - Good.

911
01:09:24,751 --> 01:09:26,275
You com pleted the task, good.

912
01:09:26,353 --> 01:09:28,844
But you broke the rule of the game.

913
01:09:29,056 --> 01:09:30,956
Where's Siya you scoundrel?

914
01:09:32,192 --> 01:09:33,921
You're not in the position
to cuss at me..

915
01:09:33,994 --> 01:09:35,325
..nor am l in the mood to hear it.

916
01:09:35,596 --> 01:09:36,028
Khan, where is Siya?

917
01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:39,122
l told you you're not allowed
to take help of outsiders.

918
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,757
You broke the rule..

919
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:44,065
..and Siya is paying for it. Look.

920
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:49,634
l decked her up, just like a bride.
And sent her off.

921
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:53,170
And she's heading
for her wedding night.

922
01:10:03,123 --> 01:10:05,114
Khan, you scoundrel..

923
01:10:05,192 --> 01:10:06,216
Leave me.

924
01:10:06,293 --> 01:10:08,090
Just because you can kill someone..

925
01:10:08,161 --> 01:10:10,095
..doesn't mean you kill him.

926
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:12,393
Still people kill.

927
01:10:12,966 --> 01:10:16,959
People kill. And only for their hobby.

928
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:21,668
The only difference
between humans and animals is..

929
01:10:21,742 --> 01:10:23,642
..that animals don't have a hobby.

930
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:28,647
Before your wife's nudity..

931
01:10:28,715 --> 01:10:33,675
..becomes the talk of the town,
go and save her.

932
01:10:38,191 --> 01:10:39,783
Run!

933
01:12:34,841 --> 01:12:36,934
Vivaan.

934
01:14:00,927 --> 01:14:01,916
lt's okay.

935
01:14:01,995 --> 01:14:04,964
Why is this happening with us?

936
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:08,531
lt had to happen with someone, Siya?

937
01:14:09,636 --> 01:14:12,127
So why not you two?

938
01:14:13,507 --> 01:14:16,476
Consider yourself fortunate Siya..

939
01:14:16,977 --> 01:14:19,275
..that even after going
through this experience..

940
01:14:19,946 --> 01:14:22,574
..at least you will
end up with money.

941
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:28,078
But it's m uch more fun
to watch a decent person..

942
01:14:28,388 --> 01:14:31,619
..act dirty then see
a rascal's dirty tricks.

943
01:14:33,293 --> 01:14:35,989
l don't want to play anymore, Vivaan.

944
01:14:38,165 --> 01:14:40,099
Please take me home.

945
01:14:40,467 --> 01:14:42,094
Please take me home.

946
01:14:42,536 --> 01:14:47,906
Mr. Khan, you know and
l've understood this is not a game.

947
01:14:49,176 --> 01:14:51,542
You should be thankful Mr. Vivaan..

948
01:14:51,611 --> 01:14:53,636
..that this is a game.

949
01:14:53,914 --> 01:14:55,006
lt is not life.

950
01:14:56,249 --> 01:14:58,911
Otherwise you would've
committed suicide as well.

951
01:15:06,259 --> 01:15:10,696
Now, the last question of this game.

952
01:15:12,232 --> 01:15:17,932
And this question
will answer all your questions.

953
01:15:20,106 --> 01:15:21,471
So Finally.

954
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:23,608
And this question is for you Siya

955
01:15:24,444 --> 01:15:26,605
And Siya,
there will be seven questions.

956
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,204
Rapid fire.

957
01:15:28,715 --> 01:15:30,444
Two crores for each answer.

958
01:15:31,051 --> 01:15:33,542
And just one task.

959
01:15:34,421 --> 01:15:36,184
Let's make this easier.

960
01:15:36,623 --> 01:15:41,390
This time you've
to lie for every question.

961
01:15:42,162 --> 01:15:46,496
For example l will ask you
''ls Mr. Vivaan your husband, .

962
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:48,463
And you will say ''No''.

963
01:15:49,035 --> 01:15:50,525
And the buzzer will be red.

964
01:15:50,604 --> 01:15:53,164
Like that.
- l get it, Khan, we're not idiots.

965
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,639
Just ask the questions.

966
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:57,370
Are you married to Vivaan?
- No.

967
01:15:57,544 --> 01:16:01,640
Are these silky black tresses yours?
- Yes.

968
01:16:02,148 --> 01:16:08,314
Do you want me to die
a cruel death like a stray dog? - No.

969
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:15,491
Siya, when that man
was toying around with your body..

970
01:16:15,695 --> 01:16:19,096
..were you enjoying it?
- Yes.

971
01:16:20,634 --> 01:16:23,626
Do you still want those 21 crores
after all the humiliation?

972
01:16:26,273 --> 01:16:27,570
No!

973
01:16:28,475 --> 01:16:31,672
Do you love your husband? - No.

974
01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:34,509
Have you ever slept with
a stranger after your marriage?

975
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:38,111
Yes.

976
01:16:39,252 --> 01:16:42,517
Siya. You had to lie.

977
01:16:45,358 --> 01:16:46,655
You said the truth.

978
01:16:47,761 --> 01:16:49,319
But l lied.
- Oh really!

979
01:16:50,463 --> 01:16:52,363
So Raj Malhotra.

980
01:16:52,766 --> 01:16:54,131
Your boss.

981
01:16:54,267 --> 01:16:55,700
No, no, no, this is all nonsense.

982
01:16:55,769 --> 01:16:57,794
Give me my dare and
end this wretched game. - One minute.

983
01:16:58,071 --> 01:17:00,062
What does Raj Malhotra got
to do with all this?

984
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,204
Vivaan..
- Are you innocent or stupid?

985
01:17:02,442 --> 01:17:03,602
Siya, what's the truth?
- No, no, trust me, Vivaan.

986
01:17:03,677 --> 01:17:04,302
l don't know..

987
01:17:04,377 --> 01:17:06,072
What are you..
- l just want to know the truth!

988
01:17:06,146 --> 01:17:08,171
l don't know,
this man's uttering nonsense.

989
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:10,580
Fine, then let me prove it to you.

990
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:15,745
No, Vivaan..
- Siya, this is your phone. Right?

991
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:17,818
Go to contacts.

992
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:19,558
Look for Raj Malhotra.

993
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:20,822
Raj Malhotra.

994
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:22,823
Malhotra.

995
01:17:23,163 --> 01:17:25,461
Raj Malhotra, boss.

996
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:28,526
Now, let's message the boss.

997
01:17:29,302 --> 01:17:33,329
Had a great time with you that night.

998
01:17:33,606 --> 01:17:35,506
The sex was great.

999
01:17:35,675 --> 01:17:37,506
And send.

1000
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:41,779
VivaanI...

1001
01:17:41,848 --> 01:17:43,247
lts coming, it's coming..

1002
01:17:43,316 --> 01:17:44,681
He must be typing it.

1003
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,762
l am sorry, l am sorry Vivaan.

1004
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:58,519
l am sorry.

1005
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:02,598
You had lost your job and
he threatened to sack me.

1006
01:18:03,703 --> 01:18:07,195
lt was important for one of us
to keep their job.

1007
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:08,831
l did this for us.

1008
01:18:09,843 --> 01:18:11,834
l did this for our family.

1009
01:18:12,112 --> 01:18:13,704
Vivaan please.

1010
01:18:16,549 --> 01:18:17,675
Please.

1011
01:18:24,624 --> 01:18:26,251
Good. Mr. Khan.

1012
01:18:27,727 --> 01:18:29,558
lsn't this what you wanted?

1013
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:32,226
Everything over.

1014
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:35,828
lf this is what you wanted
then why wait so long?

1015
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:39,536
Everything's over.

1016
01:18:42,442 --> 01:18:44,342
My house. My dreams.

1017
01:18:45,178 --> 01:18:46,577
lt's all over.

1018
01:18:47,914 --> 01:18:50,382
You wanted to break them, didn't you?

1019
01:18:55,655 --> 01:18:57,486
lt's broken now.

1020
01:19:02,562 --> 01:19:03,824
lt's all over.

1021
01:19:04,497 --> 01:19:06,761
Vivaan l..
- Leave me

1022
01:19:11,638 --> 01:19:13,731
The game is not yet over, Mr. Vivaan.

1023
01:19:13,807 --> 01:19:19,473
Your wife has broken the rule,
so she has to die.

1024
01:19:21,281 --> 01:19:25,581
The rule is, if you lie you die.

1025
01:19:25,652 --> 01:19:27,517
And she has to die.

1026
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:31,521
Mr. Khan.

1027
01:19:34,594 --> 01:19:35,720
Please.

1028
01:19:37,363 --> 01:19:38,591
Please.

1029
01:19:39,466 --> 01:19:42,264
Emotions are only for real life,
Mr. Vivaan.

1030
01:19:42,802 --> 01:19:44,770
Games only have rules.

1031
01:19:45,205 --> 01:19:45,967
And rules.

1032
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:49,868
We did everything you said.

1033
01:19:50,877 --> 01:19:52,538
Anything you said.

1034
01:19:54,848 --> 01:19:56,315
Please let Siya go.

1035
01:19:56,783 --> 01:19:58,410
Strange.

1036
01:19:58,918 --> 01:20:02,877
Your wife just slept with someone..

1037
01:20:02,956 --> 01:20:04,947
She spent the night with someone.

1038
01:20:05,558 --> 01:20:07,549
..and you still want to save her.

1039
01:20:07,727 --> 01:20:08,819
Wonderful.

1040
01:20:09,229 --> 01:20:11,356
He is the man. Great.

1041
01:20:15,401 --> 01:20:20,270
lf you want to save her...
then someone has to die.

1042
01:20:20,773 --> 01:20:22,240
Yes.

1043
01:20:22,308 --> 01:20:23,673
You.

1044
01:20:24,911 --> 01:20:26,503
Mr. Vivaan.

1045
01:20:26,846 --> 01:20:31,249
You will have to murder someone.

1046
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:34,513
What?

1047
01:20:35,355 --> 01:20:36,720
How can l kill anyone?

1048
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:40,350
lf you want to save her
then someone will have to die.

1049
01:20:40,593 --> 01:20:41,617
That;s the rule.

1050
01:20:42,028 --> 01:20:43,723
Not for the game, for life.

1051
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:48,032
And l want 1 0 million hits
on my website.

1052
01:20:48,535 --> 01:20:49,866
10 million hits.

1053
01:20:50,537 --> 01:20:53,529
And only a live murder
can give me that.

1054
01:20:54,574 --> 01:20:59,307
Because death is
the biggest entertainer of them all.

1055
01:20:59,712 --> 01:21:02,613
The best entertainment in the world.

1056
01:21:02,815 --> 01:21:03,747
The best!

1057
01:21:28,308 --> 01:21:30,299
''Love in you is..

1058
01:21:30,610 --> 01:21:33,602
..losing my soul.''

1059
01:21:34,714 --> 01:21:40,675
''l was in the lost
battle death at my door.''

1060
01:21:40,954 --> 01:21:46,722
''A dog in the backyard
feels for my pain.''

1061
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:52,393
'Be in a broken bottle
let bet and rain.'

1062
01:21:52,465 --> 01:21:56,595
''Sweetheart, come back to me.''

1063
01:21:56,970 --> 01:22:00,098
''l admit my mistake.,

1064
01:22:00,373 --> 01:22:03,570
''l'll endure your punishments.''

1065
01:22:03,643 --> 01:22:09,445
''Don't turn away,
don't leave me in tears.''

1066
01:22:10,116 --> 01:22:13,051
''l can't stop these tears.''

1067
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:20,425
'And ask you...to lool at me.'

1068
01:22:38,444 --> 01:22:41,675
'Let these tears flow.'

1069
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,512
''Only death can give me solace.''

1070
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:50,084
''l regret having deceived you.''

1071
01:22:51,624 --> 01:22:58,154
''Don't waste...your loyalty on me.''

1072
01:22:58,698 --> 01:23:03,635
''Sweetheart, betray me.''

1073
01:23:05,638 --> 01:23:10,905
''The ties we share are no use.,

1074
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:17,881
''You broke it like it
meant nothing to you.''

1075
01:23:18,618 --> 01:23:23,988
''Now it's just the memories,
me and the pain.''

1076
01:23:24,891 --> 01:23:30,761
''My faith in you turned
out to be an illusion.''

1077
01:23:52,085 --> 01:23:53,177
Can you ever..

1078
01:23:53,453 --> 01:23:55,785
Getting you out of here is
my responsibility.

1079
01:23:56,055 --> 01:23:57,579
lt's my duty and l will do it.

1080
01:23:57,724 --> 01:23:59,089
Only duty?

1081
01:25:51,137 --> 01:25:52,297
Papa.

1082
01:26:01,247 --> 01:26:02,271
Akram !

1083
01:26:15,828 --> 01:26:16,852
Shoot him.

1084
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:19,227
Please, sir.

1085
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:21,758
l cannot kill him.

1086
01:26:22,168 --> 01:26:25,365
You already killed him
partly 10 years ago.

1087
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:27,763
You just have to finish
what you started.

1088
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:29,630
Shoot him.

1089
01:26:29,942 --> 01:26:32,001
You shoot him or l shoot your wife.

1090
01:27:13,853 --> 01:27:14,649
Hey look.

1091
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,345
l am sorry. They forced me to do it.

1092
01:27:17,423 --> 01:27:18,822
Forced you.

1093
01:27:23,129 --> 01:27:24,118
lt's okay.

1094
01:27:27,099 --> 01:27:30,796
Hey. She slapped you and you're okay.

1095
01:27:32,405 --> 01:27:33,963
What's his name?

1096
01:27:35,074 --> 01:27:36,439
Akram. - Akram what?

1097
01:27:36,909 --> 01:27:37,773
Wasim Akram?

1098
01:27:37,843 --> 01:27:38,901
lt's Akram Khan.

1099
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:42,811
'A kram Khan.' Wonderful.

1100
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:44,842
You don't look so respectable..

1101
01:27:44,917 --> 01:27:46,179
..so why give
so much respect to yourself.

1102
01:27:46,252 --> 01:27:47,378
Come here.

1103
01:27:48,387 --> 01:27:49,854
Tell me one thing.

1104
01:27:50,289 --> 01:27:52,314
Has anyone kicked your back?

1105
01:27:52,391 --> 01:27:53,415
lt's okay.

1106
01:27:53,793 --> 01:27:56,261
He's getting angry.

1107
01:27:56,462 --> 01:27:58,396
Hey, angry young man.

1108
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,159
You're getting angry, aren't you?

1109
01:28:00,466 --> 01:28:01,728
Vent it out.

1110
01:28:02,001 --> 01:28:04,469
Slap her. - Point.

1111
01:28:04,737 --> 01:28:05,931
Slap this girl.

1112
01:28:06,005 --> 01:28:07,131
You should.

1113
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:08,771
What...

1114
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:15,278
Did that hurt?

1115
01:28:16,015 --> 01:28:18,950
Look. You will have to settle the score.
- Come on.

1116
01:28:19,018 --> 01:28:21,714
lf you don't hit her, then l will.

1117
01:28:21,988 --> 01:28:23,182
Okay. l will count to three.
One, two, three.

1118
01:28:23,255 --> 01:28:24,381
Why you..

1119
01:28:26,492 --> 01:28:29,017
Vivaan, Bittu, any problems.
- No, sir. No problems.

1120
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:30,960
Then leave for your classes.
- Yes, sir.

1121
01:28:42,975 --> 01:28:44,135
Surprise.

1122
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:45,268
Hi!

1123
01:28:47,046 --> 01:28:48,172
Why did you get up?

1124
01:28:48,247 --> 01:28:50,010
Go back to sleep. Go to sleep.

1125
01:28:50,216 --> 01:28:52,184
Hey Johnny Walker,
where are you coming from?

1126
01:28:52,752 --> 01:28:53,878
Your expression tells me..

1127
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:55,784
..you haven't forgotten
what happened this morning.

1128
01:28:56,389 --> 01:29:00,120
Look. Seniors have
a birth right to ragging.

1129
01:29:00,493 --> 01:29:01,790
Right? - Yes.

1130
01:29:01,861 --> 01:29:03,123
Yes. - Yes, sir. Correct.

1131
01:29:03,262 --> 01:29:05,890
Akram. Why don't you join us
for a drink?

1132
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:07,091
Yes, let's celebrate.

1133
01:29:07,166 --> 01:29:09,191
Our new friendship.
- Cheers. Cheers.

1135
01:29:11,771 --> 01:29:15,172
Look, l don't approve of you drinking
in my room with girls..

1136
01:29:15,241 --> 01:29:17,038
..at this hour.

1137
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:18,041
Please leave.

1138
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:21,202
We don't have a problem . - Did you hear,
he doesn't approve of it.

1139
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,009
Preferences change.

1140
01:29:25,951 --> 01:29:27,543
ln the morning, you liked the girl.

1141
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:31,012
And now you will like alcohol.
- Right.

1142
01:29:31,924 --> 01:29:33,186
Come on, cheers.

1143
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:35,452
Here, have a sip.

1144
01:29:36,295 --> 01:29:40,095
l said l don't drink.
- Come on. There always a first time.

1145
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:41,497
Make him drink.

1146
01:29:43,836 --> 01:29:46,532
Hey. - Come on yaar.

1147
01:29:51,177 --> 01:29:52,269
Good.

1148

''Love brought me to this..''

1149
01:30:04,824 --> 01:30:06,348
Get me a chalk, please.

1150
01:30:07,526 --> 01:30:10,359
Look, either you go or her go.
You decide it.

1151
01:30:10,429 --> 01:30:11,862
Go, hurry up.

1152
01:30:18,838 --> 01:30:20,863
What's on the second floor?

1153
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,935
The library?
- No.

1154
01:30:27,246 --> 01:30:29,441
One more.
- Go get it.

1155
01:30:30,116 --> 01:30:31,310
Please.

1156
01:30:33,185 --> 01:30:34,982
You guys don't even thank me.

1157
01:30:36,255 --> 01:30:36,949
Thank you.

1158
01:30:37,022 --> 01:30:38,546
One more.
- Thank you, one more.

1159
01:30:43,996 --> 01:30:45,930
You trouble him a lot.

1160
01:30:47,566 --> 01:30:50,057
One more please.

1161
01:31:10,489 --> 01:31:11,581
One more.

1162
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:42,917
Rapid fire.

1163
01:31:43,055 --> 01:31:45,216
Think before answering every question.

1164
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:48,324
What computer cannot be eaten?

1165
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:53,291
Don't know.
- Tell him.

1166
01:31:54,433 --> 01:31:55,593
Apple.

1167
01:31:55,668 --> 01:31:59,331
What do you call a mobile
that's never had sex?

1168
01:32:01,106 --> 01:32:02,266
The Virgin Mobile

1169
01:32:03,075 --> 01:32:04,235
Upstart.

1170
01:32:04,376 --> 01:32:06,003
lt's called No-Kia.

1171
01:32:06,545 --> 01:32:08,172
Have you ever done it?

1172
01:32:09,148 --> 01:32:14,643
lf a dog visits Google,
what will happen to him?

1173
01:32:16,522 --> 01:32:19,457
The same thing that happens
to you when you visit Google.

1174
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:23,192
One for me.

1175
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,580
What are you doing?

1176
01:32:44,083 --> 01:32:47,143
Open the door.

1177
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:12,734
Sorry.

1178
01:33:16,181 --> 01:33:16,613
Sorry.

1179
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:37,134
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

1180
01:33:39,605 --> 01:33:42,039
What are you doing? Stop him.

1181
01:34:16,175 --> 01:34:18,609
l think Akram
we should leave this college.

1182
01:34:24,183 --> 01:34:26,083
l cannot do that.

1183
01:34:29,254 --> 01:34:32,712
My dad will think his
son's making up an excuse.

1184
01:34:37,529 --> 01:34:39,463
He'll think l am just..

1185
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:43,131
l am just another loser who quit.

1186
01:34:50,175 --> 01:34:53,372
Akram, look at your condition.

1187
01:35:20,806 --> 01:35:22,740
Akram ! Akram, wait.

1188
01:35:23,509 --> 01:35:25,500
Akram, where are you going?

1189
01:35:25,577 --> 01:35:28,375
l am going to complain this.
- What?

1190
01:35:29,415 --> 01:35:31,280
We managed to escape Asthana.

1191
01:35:32,351 --> 01:35:34,285
You made me wet.

1192
01:35:34,887 --> 01:35:36,718
Where are you going in such a hurry?

1193
01:35:37,556 --> 01:35:38,853
So? Here?

1194
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:43,718
Shall we take him along?

1195
01:35:44,396 --> 01:35:45,693
Come on.

1196
01:35:45,764 --> 01:35:47,163
Come on.

1197
01:35:47,332 --> 01:35:48,822
Come on, come on.

1198
01:35:48,901 --> 01:35:50,664
You're going to complain.
- No, please.

1199
01:35:53,272 --> 01:35:54,364
Come on.
- Let him go.

1200
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,238
l won't do anything.
- He won't do it.

1201
01:35:57,509 --> 01:35:59,306
Let him go.

1202
01:35:59,845 --> 01:36:01,278
Akram !

1203
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,341
Get up.

1204
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:04,846
That's enough of your charades.
- Leave him.

1205
01:36:04,917 --> 01:36:06,646
What's your problem?

1206
01:36:06,852 --> 01:36:08,513
Why do you always have to interfere?

1207
01:36:08,754 --> 01:36:10,585
Just because we ragged you a bit..

1208
01:36:10,656 --> 01:36:12,214
..you think we raped you.

1209
01:36:12,491 --> 01:36:14,891
Thankfully l caught him
outside the principal's office.

1210
01:36:15,828 --> 01:36:17,295
lf he had gone to the principal..

1211
01:36:17,362 --> 01:36:20,297
..then it would've ruined my career,
reputation and life.

1212
01:36:20,365 --> 01:36:22,356
You want to com plain about us.
- He won't.

1213
01:36:22,434 --> 01:36:24,368
He won't do it.
l apologise on his behalf.

1214
01:36:24,436 --> 01:36:25,368
Just shut up!

1215
01:36:25,437 --> 01:36:26,734
Don't interfere.

1216
01:36:26,805 --> 01:36:28,238
No one interferes.

1217
01:36:28,307 --> 01:36:29,467
You want to com plain about us.

1218
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:31,202
Get us rusticated.

1219
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:33,435
You want to ruin our future.

1220
01:36:33,779 --> 01:36:35,906
We were just joking around with you.

1221
01:36:36,415 --> 01:36:39,543
But now you will realise
when you will become a joke.

1222
01:36:39,952 --> 01:36:43,444
Just because you seniors
have the power to do something..

1223
01:36:43,522 --> 01:36:45,820
..doesn't mean you have to do it.

1224
01:36:45,891 --> 01:36:46,983
Talking about power.

1225
01:36:47,259 --> 01:36:48,453
You want to see my power.
- No.

1226
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:49,490
You want to see my power.

1227
01:36:49,561 --> 01:36:51,825
See. See.

1228
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:54,296
You want to see more?

1229
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,392
See my power.
- Vivaan.

1230
01:36:56,869 --> 01:36:57,858
See.

1231
01:36:57,936 --> 01:37:00,268
See it. See my power.

1232
01:37:04,243 --> 01:37:06,404
You want to com plain about us.

1233
01:37:09,515 --> 01:37:11,483
Give me the camera.

1234
01:37:11,917 --> 01:37:13,248
Give me the camera.

1235
01:37:13,318 --> 01:37:14,910
Complain about us.

1236
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:19,614
l will show you power.

1237
01:37:20,659 --> 01:37:21,853
Sit.

1238
01:37:22,594 --> 01:37:23,959
Grab this video.

1239
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:25,995
He wants to see my power.

1240
01:37:31,303 --> 01:37:34,898
l tried to explain you many times.
But you just don't get it.

1241
01:37:35,807 --> 01:37:37,297
Take this.

1242
01:37:47,619 --> 01:37:49,348
Complain about us.

1243
01:37:49,421 --> 01:37:51,889
Now he will never complain about us.

1244
01:37:52,424 --> 01:37:53,914
Let's go.

1245
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:04,025
Vivaan!

1246
01:39:11,603 --> 01:39:15,437
l could've killed you this
easily on the first day itself.

1247
01:39:16,108 --> 01:39:18,804
But then you
would've never understood..

1248
01:39:18,877 --> 01:39:23,576
..the pain my child went through.

1249
01:39:27,552 --> 01:39:31,044
l never realised, sir, that our joke..

1250
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,684
Joke?

1251
01:39:33,458 --> 01:39:34,925
What joke?

1252
01:39:37,062 --> 01:39:40,054
Toying around with a naive boy..

1253
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:42,560
..and stripping him of
his honour, his character..

1254
01:39:42,634 --> 01:39:43,931
..you call the a joke.

1255
01:39:44,736 --> 01:39:47,102
Disrobing my child
in front of everyone..

1256
01:39:47,172 --> 01:39:49,834
..and mortifying him,
you call that a joke.

1257
01:39:50,809 --> 01:39:53,835
Toying with someone's innocence.

1258
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:56,577
You call that being a man.

1259
01:39:57,015 --> 01:40:00,143
l sent a sweet jolly boy.

1260
01:40:00,752 --> 01:40:05,485
You just sent a bag of bones.

1261
01:40:06,958 --> 01:40:08,823
You just sent a body.

1262
01:40:09,695 --> 01:40:11,458
He's just a lifeless body.

1263
01:40:11,530 --> 01:40:15,057
He's just a lifeless body,
Mr. Vivaan, he's not my son.

1264
01:40:15,667 --> 01:40:17,464
Tell me where my is.

1265
01:40:18,770 --> 01:40:21,500
Where is my Akram?

1266
01:40:21,973 --> 01:40:23,531
We made a big..

1267
01:40:25,677 --> 01:40:27,542
lt was a mistake, sir.

1268
01:40:33,719 --> 01:40:36,449
Today my task is finally complete.

1269
01:40:38,523 --> 01:40:40,081
You're free, you can go.

1270
01:40:40,859 --> 01:40:43,726
But this sin will never leave you.

1271
01:40:44,863 --> 01:40:45,955
Never.
