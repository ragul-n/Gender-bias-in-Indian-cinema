1
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:17,659
This is the Indian military post.

2
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:20,122
There are mountains
on both the sides.

3
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:26,205
The truck laden with arms can enter
your country only from this route!

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,672
And there are soldiers
guarding the post.

5
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:33,545
"But, without your help, how can
I take the truck to my country?"

6
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:38,150
If you manage to cross
this truck across the border...

7
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:41,882
then no Indian soldier can stop me!

8
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:49,218
This empty truck will cross
the check post with my men...

9
00:00:49,563 --> 00:00:51,497
it will go through this route...

10
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:55,692
my men will abandon the truck.

11
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,832
"Then you can take this route,
from the jungle."

12
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:46,818
Sir, this truck is empty!"

13
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:53,817
"Sir, they succeeded in
escaping the encounter..."

14
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:55,216
even the truck is empty.

15
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:57,956
"It means, this was
a plan to misguide us."

16
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:01,492
Send a message to Lieutenant Suraj
on the wireless.

17
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,476
Don't shoot or
he will blast the truck!

18
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:48,147
Put on the headlights.

19
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,419
Get down!

20
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:41,105
"We will succeed, one day... '
Oh, Colonel..."

21
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:43,774
driver, stop the car."

22
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:50,188
Why are you punishing your daughter?

23
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:55,192
"I am being punished, I have to
make her jog 5 meters everyday."

24
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:59,330
"But I have decided, I will make
her reduce 10 kilos in 10 days."

25
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:02,333
"- She is your daughter, not a cow.
- You may say what you want."

26
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:05,461
"But, this cow has to be
tied to your house!"

27
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:10,736
"- But, my house is not a stable.
- I was talking about Suraj."

28
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:14,745
"When he comes home for vacation,
he has to agree to marry Guddi."

29
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:18,741
"- Chaudhary, the bride as run away!
- Really?!"

30
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:25,156
"You have lost weight!
Batu, get the sweets!"

31
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,418
Getting! Here are
three kilos of sweets.

32
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,085
She has already eaten two kilos!

33
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,095
Let her eat, what are you losing?"

34
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:35,493
The poor girl has to waste
five liters of sweat everyday.

35
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:41,105
"Do you know, my tyrant father
makes me run 5 miles everyday."

36
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:45,308
"But, I am smarter than him, I will
not let his scheme be successful!"

37
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:50,180
- What scheme? - He wants to reduce
her weight and marry her somewhere.

38
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,841
"No Guddu, I will not get
married to someone else."

39
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:55,586
That man will not feed me
sweets the way you do!

40
00:07:56,122 --> 00:08:01,458
"Forget these sweets, if possible,
I'd feed you the entire sweet shop!"

41
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:03,195
Do you love me so much?

42
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:08,790
"If your father wouldn't carry a gun,
I would have married you long back!"

43
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:15,737
"- Guddu sir!
- Get out, don't disturb!"

44
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:31,087
You will become a pick pocketer.
Haven't I told you not to disturb me?

45
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:33,089
Guddi's father is coming this way!

46
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:39,095
"- Go stop him! You want a note?
- He is coming this way... hurry!"

47
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:41,828
Take this and scoot!

48
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,161
- Where are you going?
- Father will shoot both of us!

49
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:48,171
"I will die tomorrow...
I mean, meet tomorrow!"

50
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,058
Leave me!!

51
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:22,801
Let me sleep... you sleep
whenever you feel like...

52
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:27,738
"you go in a corner and sleep but,
let me sleep in the night!"

53
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,811
So the sun has risen!

54
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,821
Kalu, give me my glasses..."

55
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,685
if you don't then I won't
be able to see anything.

56
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,096
"I won't give you milk,
please give me my glasses."

57
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:52,827
"Come on Kalu, hurry up,
give me my glasses."

58
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:58,166
Be happy! Hey, Colonel..."

59
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:17,387
"Stop prancing like
a monkey! Stop, I say!"

60
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:22,198
Yesterday you had fever... why
are you after my life?

61
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,812
- It was put the wrong way.
- Then you put it right!

62
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,825
Stop Colonel or the thermometer will
also start prancing like a monkey!

63
00:10:58,237 --> 00:10:59,829
103 degrees!

64
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:04,507
"Colonel, I told you that
you have retired now..."

65
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:07,772
"what is the point in jogging
so much, you have gone crazy!"

66
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:14,109
- You take good care of me.
- I am like Hanuman to you!

67
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:15,786
Okay, get the thermometer."

68
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:20,190
"- Does it belong to you?
- No... but, shake it well!"

69
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:23,455
You think you are a doctor?

70
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:37,139
Hey! Your fever has
gone down so soon?

71
00:11:37,276 --> 00:11:41,212
"It is your love, if you keep
loving me, I will never get fever."

72
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,476
"But, how can your fever
go down so soon?"

73
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:52,154
"I went for a jog... so with that,
my body temperature rose..."

74
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,154
now, that has gone down, that's all!"

75
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:55,688
So now you don't have fever?

76
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,429
"You take a bath, I'll make
breakfast, no, do it the other way!"

77
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,763
"- But, fever...
- I have no fever!"

78
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:07,438
This is strange!

79
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:20,775
Hey Colonel! There is a letter!!

80
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:27,388
Let me see that letter!

81
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,595
- Give me the glasses quickly.
- Here they are!

82
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,334
- Who has sent it?
- It's from Suraj.

83
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:38,130
His leave has been sanctioned.

84
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:41,135
Suraj, your leave has been canceled."

85
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,142
What? My leave is canceled?

86
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:50,145
"- What did you do? - Ranjit,
nobody takes you seriously."

87
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:52,749
"- But, I am very serious.
- Why?"

88
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:55,820
How will we spend
two months without Suraj?

89
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,486
"You will manage but,
think about these poor guys."

90
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,625
They will get bored of your jokes.

91
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,822
"No sir, he has taken
an oath not to joke anymore!"

92
00:13:04,163 --> 00:13:07,098
"- What are you saying? - Sir,
your baggage is kept in the jeep."

93
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,518
Excuse me, what is happening here?"

94
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:38,323
Some thugs came to loot the bank..."

95
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,523
"to hide from the police,
they are hiding in the school."

96
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,466
Go out!!

97
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:07,756
"There is no way you can escape,
surrender yourself!"

98
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:17,296
Let us go or you will responsible
for the death of these children.

99
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:20,637
If you don't leave this place
in next five minutes...

100
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:23,105
then we will kill
these children one by one!

101
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:27,109
Don't shoot, no point in killing!"

102
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:29,111
You cannot escape from this place!

103
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,455
Whoever tries to get close to the
building will meet the similar fate!

104
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:43,127
Very good! They will use these
children as their armor and get out!

105
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:45,786
You start the car.

106
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,076
No!!

107
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:31,087
Get inside, come on!"

108
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,479
Drive the car, you fool!"

109
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:36,090
Sir, I salute you!"

110
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:40,758
Long live our soldiers!!

111
00:18:56,515 --> 00:19:01,452
"Alka, wake up! Look, my brother's
photo is published in the paper!"

112
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:05,723
- Let me sleep! - Wake up
and see how they have praised him.

113
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,724
I have been hearing that
since the past three years.

114
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:12,723
"Alka, the media has
printed this, not me!"

115
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:15,400
- Let them print!
- Wake up now!

116
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:20,534
- No! - You want
wake up? You just wait!

117
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:27,409
This will teach you!

118
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:35,481
- Was it fun?
- Why did you do this?

119
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:39,746
What a friend you are! Everyday I
must hear your brother's praises.

120
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:44,822
"Don't just hear, see, read,
think and understand!"

121
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,092
First read and then you talk!

122
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:54,499
"My brother Suraj, has received
an award for bravery."

123
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,107
Go, take the call."

124
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,637
"Yes brother, Minnie speaking,
I saw your photo in the paper."

125
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:05,113
I liked it a lot...

126
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:11,185
You are calling from the station?
Will you go without meeting me?

127
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,121
Please meet me and go!
For my sake! Really?

128
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:21,390
- Brother is coming to meet us.
- Meet us?! Help!!

129
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:25,131
"Sir, I have told you,
you cannot go inside."

130
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:28,206
"You go and tell Minnie,
she is a final year student."

131
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,207
- We don't have the permission.
- Then what permission do you have?

132
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:32,275
We have the permission to refuse!

133
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:09,107
"Minnie, please give
my towel... Hurry up!"

134
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:14,109
Why did you take so long?

135
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:26,390
- You are here?! - I came
to take clothes for laundry.

136
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:43,879
- What?
- Take it out!

137
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:46,216
It is dirty.

138
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,501
- Where is Minnie?
- She is very busy.

139
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:07,504
"There is a party in the lawn this
evening, in honor of her brother."

140
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:11,104
Yes, didn't you read the notice?"

141
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:16,772
Does he think he is
the Prime Minister?

142
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:27,321
"Please be quiet,
everyone will come here!"

143
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,449
There is a male in the hostel!

144
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:33,459
She is the secretary
of our college union.

145
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:40,204
"And, the moon has not yet appeared
from the clouds, I mean..."

146
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:43,536
"the most beautiful... of course,
not more beautiful than me..."

147
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:46,804
"her name is Alka,
she has yet not come!"

148
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,144
I will just be back.

149
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:54,212
"Come, let me introduce you
to my brother."

150
00:22:57,556 --> 00:22:59,148
Suraj, this is Alka."

151
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:04,285
"- You?!
- Well, I..."

152
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:06,494
Have you met him before?

153
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:09,097
When, where, why and how?"

154
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:10,495
- In the room!
- No!

155
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:14,697
- In the room?! - Didn't you
show me his photo in the paper?

156
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:58,879
I desire to be in love with you!

157
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,497
"To come close to you
and get you close to my life!""

158
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:23,574
"But, how can I express
my heart's feelings?""

159
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:17,752
"You are my life,
you are my beloved.""

160
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:23,429
You are the beat of my heart.

161
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:42,115
I need you to live!

162
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:47,516
"Sweetheart, you mean
everything to me!""

163
00:26:54,192 --> 00:27:01,462
I desire to be in love with you!

164
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:09,466
"To come close to you and
get you close to my life!""

165
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:18,078
"But, how can I express
my heart's feelings?"

166
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:37,499
There is fragrance of
flowers in the air...

167
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:43,097
I am treading on the path of love!""

168
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:49,511
You are always in my thoughts...

169
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:55,185
"you are in my dreams
and in front of me!""

170
00:27:57,456 --> 00:28:01,517
This is my only prayer to God...

171
00:28:03,462 --> 00:28:07,125
I should always be close to you!""

172
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:53,303
Halt there, you impudent girl!"

173
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:57,306
Is this the time for
decent girls to come home?

174
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:59,643
"Your highness, I beg
for your forgiveness."

175
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:03,048
"Before I forgive you, I want to
know the details of your crime."

176
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:06,650
"Tell me, which crimes
have you committed today?"

177
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:11,721
A very innocent crime... Love!

178
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:14,730
"- Love?!
- Yes, your highness!"

179
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:17,391
"Love is a departmental store
of crimes, you insolent girl!"

180
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:21,066
Tell me one by one, what did you do?"

181
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:25,739
"First of all,
the prince caught my hand."

182
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:29,408
"Does that mean, he took
your hand in his hands?"

183
00:29:32,284 --> 00:29:35,685
"- Yes, your highness.
- How did you feel?"

184
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,746
- Very good!
- After that?

185
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:42,092
He pulled me close to him.

186
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,761
- How close?
- Very close!

187
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:51,292
- After that?
- He held my face in his hands.

188
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:55,633
He held your face in
your hands? After that?

189
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:00,503
His breath mingled with mine.

190
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:03,510
Your breaths mingled? After that?

191
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:08,176
"After that, I could not
speak anything, your highness."

192
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,185
Why couldn't you speak?

193
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,181
My lips were sealed.

194
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:16,453
Your lips were sealed?! What?

195
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:21,188
My brother sealed your lips!!

196
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:31,202
"Madam, but you will have to open
your lips in front of your father."

197
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:36,144
- Why? - Why? Take
this book and pen...

198
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:40,341
write a letter to your father!
- What do I write?

199
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:45,216
Hey! Don't write what I asked
you and what you told me.

200
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,356
Oh! It's Alka's letter.

201
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:54,562
I love Suraj and
would like to marry him.'

202
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:03,701
Oh my, he is also a military man!"

203
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:06,710
Why did you fall for this idiot?

204
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:08,778
This is your hundred rupee note.

205
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:12,844
"What is this written,
...with love from Suraj!"

206
00:31:13,251 --> 00:31:16,186
My dear, this is just written..."

207
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:21,520
it will be valid
when my brother signs it.

208
00:31:27,532 --> 00:31:30,660
- Can you see this note?
- What is so special about it?

209
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:33,531
This is what is special
about this note.

210
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:39,337
- Who has written this?
- Minnie.

211
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:45,341
- This is a token of our first
meeting. - Let me stamp it forever!

212
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:48,682
- Not now.
- Then when?

213
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:50,485
After marriage.

214
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:13,436
- Was your photo published
in the paper? - Yes.

215
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:15,773
Your act of bravery is
the talk of the town.

216
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:25,315
"I am burning in the fire
of your love, sweetheart."

217
00:32:25,457 --> 00:32:27,789
"For the moment,
one autograph will do."

218
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:39,602
"Seeing your picture, I told
my father that I would marry you."

219
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:40,796
But, who is this other woman?"

220
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,812
Here.

221
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:56,346
You don't let me sign that note
and now you are jealous of them?

222
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:06,089
"I just gave you all an autograph,
why have you come back?"

223
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:19,769
Oh! So this was your prank?
Get down!

224
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:23,176
"I did play a prank but,
just a minute..."

225
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,512
"You have seen the snowfall, I mean,
this snow has fallen over you."

226
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:33,783
Now will you think
of people besides Alka?

227
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:35,454
For example, our father!"

228
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:44,464
What is it?

229
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:49,339
- What was that for? - I want
to know why you are silent?

230
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:54,874
I have noticed that you are
very sullen since past three days.

231
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:59,547
You are right! My hopes were
raised that he is coming on a leave...

232
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:03,813
he rose our expectations
and kept us waiting!

233
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:08,489
"Since days, we are just
looking forward to his arrival."

234
00:34:11,363 --> 00:34:12,625
There he comes!

235
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,094
- Soldier has come! - Suraj
has come home on a holiday!

236
00:34:18,303 --> 00:34:20,635
Kalu can sniff him
from 2 miles away!

237
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:24,833
"That is why, he makes that sound.
Now I'll get you married soon!"

238
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:40,185
- My soldier son!
- Father!

239
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:44,127
"I had gone to meet Minnie,
she is enjoying herself."

240
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:47,390
- She isn't studying? - Can't
she study and enjoy herself?

241
00:34:47,532 --> 00:34:51,195
What is your problem? You take
out the bags and let us talk!

242
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:52,530
You don't talk to him!

243
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:58,471
Colonel! Where
are you my relative?

244
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,137
"- Come, Chaudhry!
- Colonel, here I am!"

245
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,408
- Where is the cow?
- First let me see the stable.

246
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,485
"- Is Suraj alright?
- He is, I will call him."

247
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,487
"- Stable! - What,
he called me a stable?"

248
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:15,684
"No, you are like a wash room!
Go and call Suraj!"

249
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:20,495
- There he is! - Haven't I told
you not to walk out while shaving?

250
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,430
"- Hello, Chaudhry!
- Hello!"

251
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:25,559
- He has come here to talk
about a proposal. - Whose proposal?

252
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:28,570
- My daughter's proposal.
- Bihari is still a bachelor.

253
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:30,439
- What happened?
- A mosquito!

254
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:34,109
"Colonel, I came to talk about
her alliance with Suraj."

255
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:38,443
"- Remember, I told you my
daughter... - Yes, sit down!"

256
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:42,585
- Thank you!
- What is her name?

257
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:47,451
"First change her name,
Guddi (doll) is meant to be carried..."

258
00:35:48,193 --> 00:35:50,127
and played with.

259
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:53,125
You think Suraj can do all this?

260
00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:55,528
You need to find
a truck for your daughter.

261
00:35:57,735 --> 00:36:01,466
"Don't worry Suraj, I make
her run 5 kilometers everyday."

262
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:04,132
"Chaudhry, why don't you take
a chance somewhere else?"

263
00:36:06,077 --> 00:36:10,810
I've heard a rumor that your daughter
is seeing someone else on sly!

264
00:36:11,149 --> 00:36:14,209
"- Is it? What do you mean?
- Chaudhry, he is Bihari!"

265
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,812
I thought he was a Punjabi!

266
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:21,091
"I mean, he is Bihari, not a
dictionary to know all the meanings."

267
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,763
"He has told you, now you find out
about her. She is your problem."

268
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:31,435
Have some more... you
are losing weight!

269
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:37,637
"- Guddu, Guddi's father
is coming. - Let him come!"

270
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:39,640
- He looks very angry.
- I don't care!

271
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:44,639
Oh! Hide yourself! A truck
is hiding behind a cycle?

272
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,311
You lie down here... hurry up!

273
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:52,451
This bed sheet will not cover her!

274
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:02,598
- Where is she?
- Whom are you looking for?

275
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:07,128
"If I find what I am looking for,
I will shoot that person!"

276
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:13,471
Where is he? Give this to me!
Where is that rascal?

277
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:17,479
- Which rascal? - The one who is
flirting with my innocent daughter.

278
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:21,276
"- Flirting? - Yes, he is
trapping her in his love."

279
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:23,814
That rascal is sitting
on your daughter.

280
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:26,749
- Just a minute.
- Who is sitting?

281
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:28,615
- That rascal!
- Just a minute.

282
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:33,487
- Where is he sitting?
- In your daughter's mind and heart.

283
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,759
- How did you know?
- Just a minute.

284
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:40,763
- It is happening in front of me!
- Just a minute!

285
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:43,437
Hey! Why are you giving him money?

286
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:47,841
- I am giving his salary. - Why
don't you give it once for all?

287
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,373
He wastes his money on drinks.

288
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:52,779
"- Chaudhry, I know!
- Here, take your entire salary!"

289
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:57,114
"- What do you know?
- Come with me, I will tell you."

290
00:37:58,189 --> 00:37:59,781
Without fees, I cannot tell you!"

291
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:02,786
What fees? Are you a secret agent?

292
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:08,063
"You don't know about his family,
his great grandfather was 009..."

293
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:11,724
"his grandfather was 008,
his father was 007..."

294
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:14,129
and he is 006!

295
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:21,137
- What is he doing in this lousy
hotel? - I've to be in a disguise.

296
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:24,472
"Give me hundred rupees, I will
tell you that man's name in a minute."

297
00:38:24,616 --> 00:38:27,414
"- Really? - No, he'll take a week,
it takes time to search a person."

298
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:34,424
"Okay... take this money but,
I should know about him in a week."

299
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,434
"Kalu, give my glasses,
I cannot see..."

300
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:54,643
"I am not deaf, just a
little blind... is that Ramu?"

301
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:57,178
Give the milk... oh! You are here?

302
00:38:57,315 --> 00:39:00,443
"Have you got the milk bill?
But, I cannot find my glasses."

303
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:04,385
"Without glasses, I am blind
and master has gone for a jog..."

304
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:07,719
"his son is sleeping,
without glasses I cannot see..."

305
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:09,048
then how can I pay your bill?

306
00:39:10,194 --> 00:39:13,459
- Where could his glasses be?
- Who was that?

307
00:39:18,202 --> 00:39:23,139
If you have found my glasses give it
back so that I can see who you are?

308
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:51,427
Who are you?

309
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:57,107
- Why have you come here? - To
talk about my daughter's proposal.

310
00:39:57,308 --> 00:39:59,503
Oh! Is that why you are kneeling?

311
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:01,442
- What?
- With whom?

312
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:08,115
With Yashpal Dutt's son.
He is in love with my daughter.

313
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:10,846
"You are lucky that you daughter
loves you that's why, she told you..."

314
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:14,523
"perhaps, my son doesn't love me
that is why, he did not tell me."

315
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:18,459
If the girl and boy agree
then we also agree.

316
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:22,191
"- It means, we become relatives?
- Yes, let us embrace each other!"

317
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:32,138
"This may sound old fashioned but,
we must match their horoscopes."

318
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:35,810
"Don't worry, I have got it along
and that too, after matching it!"

319
00:41:02,173 --> 00:41:04,107
"Sorry Alka, I got late
because of my friends."

320
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,514
Not me, it was Minnie!!"

321
00:41:18,256 --> 00:41:20,121
I am fed up of her!
I wonder when she will...

322
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:23,125
"Brother, how did
you like your wife?"

323
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:28,130
No! Don't vent out your anger
on me... vent it out on her!

324
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,129
Here she is!

325
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:37,334
Soldiers will become
martyrs for their country! '

326
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:40,477
"I will deal with you in the
morning, now you leave, crazy girl!"

327
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:01,160
What is this?

328
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:08,429
You still remember it?

329
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:34,192
You all are welcome to hotel Mewar
Palace and best dance couple contest.

330
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:40,464
You all must be eager to know
the best couple of this season.

331
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:46,801
"My friends, the best pair is the
honeymoon couple, Mr & Mrs. Suraj!"

332
00:42:54,418 --> 00:42:57,148
"Madam, these claps
will not suffice."

333
00:42:58,222 --> 00:42:59,883
- Why?
- I need a kiss.

334
00:43:02,093 --> 00:43:04,288
"- Here?! - Yes here,
in front of everyone!"

335
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:08,761
- Have you gone mad? - Be quick
or I will start drinking.

336
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,425
"- And if I drink, I will
create a scene. - No!"

337
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:12,768
No?

338
00:43:55,212 --> 00:44:01,742
A drink is that which
spills from the glass...

339
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:19,293
"and love is that,
which oozes from the eyes!""

340
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:17,291
An ocean can never
hide the waves...

341
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:27,102
"light can never be concealed
within the lamp.""

342
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:37,507
The mirror reflects the image...

343
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:41,845
"and it's fragrance
will be felt in the air!""

344
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:53,524
"A flower is the one which
smells on blooming!""

345
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:52,515
To show the new light of love...

346
00:46:57,394 --> 00:47:01,660
"I have come here
to wipe out hatred!""

347
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:12,131
I will befriend the entire world!

348
00:47:12,476 --> 00:47:16,810
"I will hum the song
of love all my life!""

349
00:47:21,352 --> 00:47:25,755
"Song is the one
which is played on music!""

350
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:04,450
Give that to me, it is my drink."

351
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:10,056
Sir, there is a call for you."

352
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:12,466
Come back soon.

353
00:48:31,355 --> 00:48:33,687
- Whose call was it?
- My ex-girlfriend.

354
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:37,490
- Don't harass me on my honeymoon.
- Tell me the truth.

355
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:41,356
"It was father's call, Minnie's
engagement has been fixed."

356
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:43,827
We have to go to the groom's
house on the 26th.

357
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:46,432
See all the things
that I have got for you.

358
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:51,166
"This is for your father in law,
this is for your mother in law..."

359
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:52,832
- Can't it be the other way?
- What?

360
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:56,505
"- Never mind. - No, tell me.
What are you trying to say?"

361
00:48:56,714 --> 00:48:59,376
- He is trying to criticize your
mother in law! - Not at all!

362
00:48:59,516 --> 00:49:03,043
- Uncle Bihari! - What if we could
make your father in law wear a sari?

363
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:06,384
"Yes why not, we can also make
an elephant wear a swimming suit."

364
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:09,048
"You can become young, you can
start seeing without glasses!"

365
00:49:09,193 --> 00:49:12,594
- You don't like when I talk!
- You speak rubbish!

366
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,326
Tell me, what is in that bag?"

367
00:49:17,468 --> 00:49:20,062
"- This is for you.
- No, in that bag!"

368
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,402
This ring is for your husband.

369
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:30,140
Such a light ring for my husband?

370
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:33,214
Do you want me to make
a diamond ring for him?

371
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:38,081
Brother is back!!

372
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:39,483
We are back!

373
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:43,155
- How are you?
- I am fine.

374
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,819
- Who will pick this?
- Am I your servant?

375
00:49:46,163 --> 00:49:47,562
Take the bags yourself.
Come with me!

376
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,158
Come, child!"

377
00:49:52,102 --> 00:49:54,502
"No, first seek his blessings
or he will feel offended."

378
00:49:54,638 --> 00:49:56,230
The poor man is elder than me
by three months and three days.

379
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:59,501
Wow! I feel like
calling you General!

380
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,510
"Don't take me so seriously,
you can seek my blessings first."

381
00:50:02,646 --> 00:50:05,114
- He will never improve!
- God bless you!

382
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:07,514
He will not give up his old habits!

383
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:14,648
"Just see, looks like they both have
had a lot of honey on the moon!"

384
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:17,192
- Don't cast an evil eye!
- I am not doing that!

385
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:22,192
"- Is this for Minnie's engagement?
- Suraj, we have to leave early."

386
00:50:22,866 --> 00:50:26,859
"Let's do one thing father, we will
take her and leave her there!"

387
00:50:28,205 --> 00:50:32,141
"You cannot get rid of me so easily,
I will make you spend a lot!"

388
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:35,141
"You can make us spend
but, leave us alone!"

389
00:50:35,346 --> 00:50:39,874
"She will not leave is easily,
she will cry and make us cry too!"

390
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:43,812
- She will refuse to go!
- Why will I? I'm not going to cry!

391
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:46,155
All girls says that
they will not cry...

392
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:48,154
didn't you cry while
leaving your father's house?

393
00:50:48,826 --> 00:50:52,557
"- But, I will not! - No, even
you will cry, I am sure!"

394
00:50:53,297 --> 00:50:55,822
My dear child! I will surely cry!

395
00:51:04,174 --> 00:51:05,163
- Please come.
- How are you?

396
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:06,173
This is my son, Suraj."

397
00:51:16,186 --> 00:51:17,118
Get them a cold drink.

398
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:25,728
Who is that with my father in law?

399
00:51:27,197 --> 00:51:28,323
He is your brother in law.

400
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:31,460
He is the same from whose clutches
I managed to escape at the border.

401
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,404
"Father, if he is the boy then the
engagement will not take place."

402
00:51:39,343 --> 00:51:40,139
Why, son?"

403
00:51:40,344 --> 00:51:43,871
"Because, he is the same whom
I caught smuggling illegal weapons."

404
00:51:44,214 --> 00:51:45,146
He is a traitor!

405
00:51:45,482 --> 00:51:47,814
- Run from here!
- Hey! Stop him!

406
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:39,460
Come on, drive faster!"

407
00:53:21,178 --> 00:53:22,167
Go over him!

408
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:40,591
Arrest him!

409
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:46,125
"Colonel, stop them! He is
going to be your son in law!"

410
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:49,865
- We are going to be related.
- I'm glad this relation is severed!

411
00:53:50,874 --> 00:53:53,342
We are soldiers who sacrifice
our lives for our country...

412
00:53:54,211 --> 00:53:55,803
we cannot have relations with
the enemies of our country!

413
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:58,340
Then listen to me, Colonel..."

414
00:53:59,216 --> 00:54:02,743
my son's alliance was fixed
in front of the society...

415
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,617
"by breaking this alliance,
you will be defaming my honor."

416
00:54:07,157 --> 00:54:10,149
And I will not let that happen!

417
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:14,494
- What will you do? - You will
get your sister married somewhere...

418
00:54:14,631 --> 00:54:15,620
you can see then!

419
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:21,637
"Let's go Suraj,
barking dogs seldom bite."

420
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:28,501
Colonel, you have not seen my bark."

421
00:54:29,179 --> 00:54:33,707
You have come across someone
who can bark as well as bite!

422
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:37,114
"- Father! - Why do you
have to cry, silly girl?"

423
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:38,845
"We have broken the match,
they haven't!"

424
00:54:39,189 --> 00:54:42,647
"You should be happy, what if you
would know after the marriage..."

425
00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:44,455
"that he is a traitor,
what would you do?"

426
00:54:44,595 --> 00:54:50,534
"My daughter is very fortunate, you
are not destined to marry a rogue..."

427
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:53,601
your friend Alka was destined
for that and she has found one!

428
00:54:55,205 --> 00:55:01,075
"You should be happy, you should
sing, dance, enjoy and..."

429
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:05,812
"- Father!!
- What happened, Colonel?"

430
00:55:06,483 --> 00:55:08,747
"Son, take care,
I will get a doctor."

431
00:55:10,354 --> 00:55:13,482
"Nothing is wrong, you all
were unnecessarily worried."

432
00:55:13,624 --> 00:55:15,148
Gas problem can create this.

433
00:55:16,093 --> 00:55:18,084
Even gas problem first sees
the rank and then salutes!

434
00:55:18,228 --> 00:55:22,164
"It knew it was Colonel's body,
so it requires a lot of power!"

435
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:26,633
"- Okay! - Colonel, come to the
hospital, I will check you there."

436
00:55:27,104 --> 00:55:29,095
- Alright.
- I will leave now.

437
00:55:29,172 --> 00:55:30,833
- Take his bag.
- I am taking!

438
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:33,435
Minnie, go and get a pack of cards."

439
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:36,778
I salute your Jack!

440
00:55:37,114 --> 00:55:39,105
How come he needs all the cards?

441
00:55:39,316 --> 00:55:43,514
"- But, Minnie won't need this.
- How can I need such a rotten card?"

442
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:45,781
- A rotten face will get
rotten cards! - Shut up!

443
00:55:46,189 --> 00:55:51,126
"- She has my card. - You have
my card, why don't you give?"

444
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,858
- Look at that!
- Stop helping each other.

445
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:01,134
We are friends... take this!

446
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:04,065
"- Pick it! - I don't
need it, you blind man!"

447
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:05,399
I meant from top!

448
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:11,470
You come on my left!
I am getting all useless cards!

449
00:56:20,157 --> 00:56:23,285
"Suraj always gets
the right cards, you fatso!"

450
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:29,488
"- Greetings, uncle!
- Come in!"

451
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:36,835
"All the while you play cards, go
and make tea and take the glasses."

452
00:56:38,175 --> 00:56:40,700
- Why don't you buy one
for yourself? - I will!

453
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:43,836
"- How are you, how is everyone
at home? - All are fine."

454
00:56:45,182 --> 00:56:47,844
I had come here
with some important work.

455
00:56:48,118 --> 00:56:52,646
"- Minnie, let's make some
savories - Make some for me too!"

456
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:56,725
Now tell me, son."

457
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,318
"Uncle, your friend,
priest Rampyare..."

458
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:04,457
"- Is he dead? - Father,
please be serious for a change."

459
00:57:05,202 --> 00:57:11,141
"- Tell me. - Suraj knows that
I want to marry his daughter, Rekha."

460
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:16,405
"And he refused because, he doesn't
want to marry her outside his caste."

461
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:18,741
But, his daughter is a widow."

462
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:21,674
Yes, it's been six months now."

463
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:25,082
Rekha and I loved each other...

464
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,481
"even today, I am
willing to accept her."

465
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:32,152
"What could be better news
than this for him, young man?"

466
00:57:32,362 --> 00:57:37,493
"I tried to talk to him but, he is
not willing to change his stance."

467
00:57:37,634 --> 00:57:39,761
"Father, when will
these people improve?"

468
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:42,171
Is the society greater
than the daughter's life?

469
00:57:42,305 --> 00:57:45,172
"Ajay, you don't worry,
we will talk to Rampyare."

470
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:50,506
What is the point in talking?
Joys and sorrows are predestined.

471
00:57:51,381 --> 00:57:55,715
My daughter became a widow due to
the sins of her last birth.

472
00:57:55,852 --> 00:57:59,845
"Excuse me sir but,
times have changed when..."

473
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:01,055
widow remarriage was considered sin.

474
00:58:03,326 --> 00:58:05,260
Get out from this hypocrisies
of good and bad deeds.

475
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:08,262
"When a goat is slaughtered in
a priest's house, it is a sin."

476
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:10,729
"But, when that goat is slaughtered
in a butcher's house, it's not a sin?"

477
00:58:13,336 --> 00:58:17,670
"If I shoot anyone here, it is
considered as sin, a crime."

478
00:58:18,141 --> 00:58:22,544
"But, if people are killed on
the battlefield, I am given medals?"

479
00:58:27,484 --> 00:58:30,817
I am sorry if I have
said anything wrong.

480
00:58:31,221 --> 00:58:34,156
No son, I should apologize."

481
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:39,685
You are much more learned than me.
You have taught me a good lesson!

482
00:59:00,584 --> 00:59:04,042
"Guddi, don't you think that
there was no fun in this marriage?"

483
00:59:04,254 --> 00:59:09,453
"My dear, fun begins after
marriage... amongst the couple!"

484
00:59:10,193 --> 00:59:15,722
You speak rubbish! Won't he think
his sisters in law had no fun?

485
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:58,768
"You are a spark yourself,
why did you need this fire?"

486
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:02,374
Why is it bothering you? We are
playing a prank with the groom.

487
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:04,104
Besides, we have a right!"

488
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:07,642
"Then before the groom,
you have a right over me!"

489
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:13,187
We don't even know you! Why
should we play pranks with you?

490
01:00:13,323 --> 01:00:17,191
"You will know me, I am
the groom's younger brother."

491
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:18,191
Brother?!

492
01:00:20,196 --> 01:00:21,128
Let's go!

493
01:00:34,277 --> 01:00:37,212
"This is too much! Uncle Bihari,
get the food, I am very hungry!"

494
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:39,674
- My salad!
- Lentils for me!

495
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:43,547
- My soup? - It is difficult
to make your soup.

496
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:46,485
- Why? - I will have
to put you in the cooker.

497
01:00:47,223 --> 01:00:48,815
- It will take 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes more?

498
01:00:51,294 --> 01:00:56,357
A long, endless wait for food!"'

499
01:00:58,568 --> 01:01:00,502
"- Minnie, can you cry?
- What do you mean?"

500
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:05,104
"- Can you sing a song?
- Why sing, I can cry!"

501
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:11,105
My fragile heart cannot
endure the endless grief...

502
01:01:11,247 --> 01:01:18,119
subjected by this cruel world! '

503
01:01:19,656 --> 01:01:20,520
Father!

504
01:01:22,525 --> 01:01:24,789
"Father, your song is
over, stop crying."

505
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:27,528
"- How was it, son?
- Excellent!"

506
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:31,523
"Okay, let's start singing,
you start from alphabet R'..."

507
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:35,728
"- She is close to you, tell her!
- Ms. Pinky, you start!"

508
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:37,195
Shall I?

509
01:01:52,756 --> 01:01:55,224
With whom? Minnie's
secret is exposed.

510
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:57,553
"If you talk more I will
not play, I am going!"

511
01:01:57,761 --> 01:02:00,423
Sit down! Tell me
what I have to sing?

512
01:02:27,123 --> 01:02:29,114
I don't know further!

513
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:32,856
Sing from Y'.

514
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:47,536
"- He finished my soup!
- It's over, father!"

515
01:02:48,211 --> 01:02:50,873
Now you start singing from H'!

516
01:02:51,214 --> 01:02:52,545
Sing fast or I will sing!

517
01:02:57,153 --> 01:02:59,621
"- Come, son! - I was
thinking of the same song!"

518
01:03:00,356 --> 01:03:04,816
"Bihari, get one more plate. You will
get food but I'll get the dessert."

519
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:08,488
"Yes meanwhile, eat this
and think of God!"

520
01:03:08,565 --> 01:03:09,497
Spare him!

521
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:13,166
- How is Ajay?
- He is fine.

522
01:03:13,436 --> 01:03:16,166
"He has sent me here, there
is a party in our house."

523
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:17,637
You all are invited.

524
01:03:18,108 --> 01:03:22,772
"- We will come! - Alka,
where is the garlic pickle?"

525
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:25,170
"- It's in the bag. I'll get it.
- No, I will get it."

526
01:04:00,216 --> 01:04:02,810
- Where are you going?
- I was...

527
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:06,620
- I want a hundred rupee note.
- You are always greedy for money!

528
01:04:07,223 --> 01:04:10,090
Oh! And which hunger
is torturing you?

529
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:16,158
"Okay, go! But watch out
from the eyes of the world!"

530
01:04:26,843 --> 01:04:29,437
- What did she say?
- She read your letter.

531
01:04:29,646 --> 01:04:32,513
She read the letter? That's good.

532
01:04:32,649 --> 01:04:34,844
"If she has given her consent,
Suraj will also agree."

533
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:39,584
"- But, what about father?
- I will talk to him."

534
01:04:40,123 --> 01:04:43,854
- How can you talk about yourself?
- I think it won't be right!

535
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:47,127
Hey! What are you both doing here?

536
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:50,128
I was talking to her
about her college.

537
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:52,858
Really? She has finished
her college long back!

538
01:04:53,203 --> 01:04:55,262
"- Isn't it, Minnie?
- Yes, we were..."

539
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:59,535
- We were talking about her
results. - She passes every exam.

540
01:04:59,742 --> 01:05:02,802
"You think about yourself! Go,
your brother is looking for you."

541
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:07,472
- How is he?
- Who?

542
01:05:07,684 --> 01:05:10,744
My brother in law... will he pass?

543
01:05:17,627 --> 01:05:19,686
This color suits you so much...

544
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:24,692
"inspite of not wanting,
I keep looking at you!"

545
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:29,435
"After drinking,
you cannot see anything!"

546
01:05:29,772 --> 01:05:33,503
- Move away!
- Come that side and drink!

547
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:45,514
- What are you thinking?
- I've never seen my wife jealous.

548
01:05:45,655 --> 01:05:50,251
"The more your wife loves you,
the more she gets jealous!"

549
01:05:50,393 --> 01:05:53,851
- Is it?
- Why don't you test her?

550
01:05:54,864 --> 01:05:58,129
"Okay, tonight is
my last night here..."

551
01:05:58,268 --> 01:05:59,462
I am going tomorrow...

552
01:06:00,203 --> 01:06:02,137
let's make this night memorable!

553
01:06:02,272 --> 01:06:05,400
- We must do something!
- What can we do?

554
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:06,734
How?

555
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,741
- Come with me.
- Where is he going?

556
01:06:15,218 --> 01:06:18,483
"Excuse me, can I borrow
your wife for some time?"

557
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:22,147
"- Why, what is the matter?
- We are putting up an act."

558
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:26,490
- What act? - I want to
make my wife jealous.

559
01:06:28,364 --> 01:06:31,492
"Here, take this
and make her jealous!"

560
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:34,763
"Not this way... by standing
with another woman!"

561
01:06:35,238 --> 01:06:39,174
"Actually, the party is quite dull,
we are trying add some life."

562
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:45,443
"By trying to add life in the party,
I shouldn't be out of her life!"

563
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:48,175
"- Of course not! Come with me!
- Just a minute, brother."

564
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:52,117
Tonight, you are free for some time."

565
01:07:54,117 --> 01:08:01,114
You will miss my commitment!

566
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:16,735
You will cry and protest!

567
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:44,156
You have ruined me...

568
01:08:53,242 --> 01:09:00,114
who else will you ruin?""

569
01:09:20,136 --> 01:09:23,799
You will never forget me...

570
01:09:33,149 --> 01:09:40,282
"you will remember me
when I am gone!""

571
01:10:11,521 --> 01:10:18,654
You will miss my love!

572
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:34,472
You will cry and protest!

573
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:54,220
You have forgotten the ones
who belong to you...

574
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:10,504
how can you remember someone else?""

575
01:11:30,132 --> 01:11:35,126
You have plundered my life...

576
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:50,811
how can you live happily?""

577
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:24,515
"Alka, why did you get upset,
he was just joking!"

578
01:12:25,187 --> 01:12:27,519
He borrowed my wife for this joke.

579
01:12:27,657 --> 01:12:29,522
He wanted to see
how much you love him.

580
01:12:30,259 --> 01:12:33,194
And this is the cassette...
keep it with you!

581
01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:36,321
"When he will go away, listen to
this and entertain yourself!"

582
01:12:39,535 --> 01:12:41,526
- Where are you taking me?
- Are they saying the truth?

583
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:44,671
- Yes! - Will you
ever do this again?

584
01:12:44,874 --> 01:12:45,806
Never!

585
01:12:50,413 --> 01:12:54,543
"I have called you here because, it
is my duty to tell you that..."

586
01:12:55,284 --> 01:12:57,548
the pain Colonel got in his chest...

587
01:12:58,421 --> 01:13:00,150
was actually a minor attack.

588
01:13:01,357 --> 01:13:04,224
"- But doctor, you said...
- A doctor should tell the truth."

589
01:13:04,627 --> 01:13:09,826
But we have to keep in mind when
and to whom we should tell the truth.

590
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,759
When are you leaving?

591
01:13:13,102 --> 01:13:14,763
Today but, is it very serious?"

592
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:17,438
If you say then
I can extend my leave.

593
01:13:18,307 --> 01:13:20,104
No, there is no such emergency."

594
01:13:21,177 --> 01:13:23,509
But he has to take a lot
of care in your absence.

595
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:28,113
"And remember one thing,
he should not doubt that..."

596
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,115
he had a heart attack.

597
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:39,790
Brother, what did the doctor say?"

598
01:13:41,330 --> 01:13:44,128
"It was not a gas trouble,
it was a mild heart attack."

599
01:13:45,534 --> 01:13:48,128
Doctor should have told us.

600
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:52,134
"Don't worry, if it was serious,
I would have extended my leave."

601
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:56,875
"But remember, he should not know
this and he shouldn't get a shock!"

602
01:13:59,482 --> 01:14:03,475
"Alka, Minnie, I am leaving
father in your hands."

603
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:05,081
Take care good of him!

604
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:08,289
"- Hurry up now! - Quick, being
in the military you are delaying?"

605
01:14:08,424 --> 01:14:09,413
Leaving, father!"

606
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:13,686
"- What is this doing here?
- Father, let me..."

607
01:14:15,164 --> 01:14:19,624
"Come on, we should reach
the platform half a hour before."

608
01:14:20,102 --> 01:14:23,435
- Right?
- Come on!

609
01:14:25,107 --> 01:14:26,096
I will carry that!

610
01:14:27,109 --> 01:14:31,102
"Bihari, you take a long time,
you have become old!"

611
01:14:31,247 --> 01:14:34,239
I can see how young you are.
You get gas trouble very often!

612
01:14:34,383 --> 01:14:36,851
"- Gas comes seeing my rank!
- Suraj, please explain to him."

613
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:39,780
"- Father, take care.
- Yes, I will."

614
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:43,523
"- Okay, Uncle Bihari.
- God bless you, son."

615
01:14:44,794 --> 01:14:48,525
"You make us wait for a year,
this time come soon."

616
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:55,135
Go!

617
01:15:01,343 --> 01:15:02,401
God bless you!

618
01:15:09,752 --> 01:15:15,554
What are you doing? Your mother had
got this amulet to protect you!

619
01:15:17,493 --> 01:15:19,427
Your blessings are
enough to protect me.

620
01:15:19,562 --> 01:15:23,828
"- That's not right!
- Father, don't break my heart."

621
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:46,381
"Father, tell Minnie not to
harass my wife in my absence."

622
01:15:46,522 --> 01:15:49,457
"Before she became your wife,
she was my friend."

623
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:52,459
"- I will hit you.
- Father, see what he is doing!"

624
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:53,527
Silly girl!

625
01:15:55,664 --> 01:15:59,122
You are getting late!
You also go along.

626
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:23,490
Attention!

627
01:16:32,101 --> 01:16:36,504
"We have got a report that tonight,
a few secret documents..."

628
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:38,766
will be smuggled across the border.

629
01:16:39,174 --> 01:16:43,372
They are very important documents
and should not be sent across.

630
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:47,315
"Tonight, we will have
a watch on the border."

631
01:17:06,468 --> 01:17:10,404
"Commander, I am giving you my
country's secrets at a low price."

632
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:12,404
Where is the money?

633
01:17:14,476 --> 01:17:20,346
- Here! - Now how you take these
documents is your responsibility.

634
01:17:37,166 --> 01:17:39,498
"Careful, the other country's
military will be on that side!"

635
01:17:39,635 --> 01:17:43,162
- They can shoot you! - I cannot
let them take the documents.

636
01:17:53,515 --> 01:17:55,107
Throw your weapons!

637
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:07,394
Give the file!

638
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:14,060
Throw your gun!

639
01:19:04,787 --> 01:19:07,051
"You take the documents,
I will stop them!"

640
01:19:08,323 --> 01:19:09,722
Suraj, I cannot leave you alone!"

641
01:19:10,059 --> 01:19:11,458
Listen to me and go quickly!

642
01:19:11,593 --> 01:19:12,787
But how can I leave...

643
01:19:46,295 --> 01:19:49,093
"Colonel, I have got your
daughter in law's report..."

644
01:19:49,231 --> 01:19:50,095
she is expecting.

645
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:56,504
"Really? Father, if she was here,
I would convey her the good news."

646
01:19:56,705 --> 01:19:59,765
- Where is she? - She has gone
to her father's house.

647
01:20:00,242 --> 01:20:06,306
It's her first delivery and you do
not have a trained woman at home.

648
01:20:07,182 --> 01:20:09,173
"- So, you will have to be
very careful. - Alright."

649
01:20:23,332 --> 01:20:25,527
I want to go to
Colonel Yashpal Dutt's house.

650
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:30,398
"- I am Yashpal Dutt... are you
Suraj's friend? - Yes, sir!"

651
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:34,471
"- I am his friend, Basharat Khan.
- Suraj did not come along?"

652
01:20:37,146 --> 01:20:39,341
"- Sir, he...
- What is the matter?"

653
01:20:44,686 --> 01:20:47,553
Look, your eyes say that..."

654
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:56,561
- Tell me clearly! - I have
come to give his baggage.

655
01:20:58,233 --> 01:20:59,825
To give his bags??

656
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:37,333
I am fine!!

657
01:22:51,146 --> 01:22:52,135
You return back from here.

658
01:22:55,884 --> 01:22:57,818
Think that you never came here!

659
01:22:59,554 --> 01:23:01,283
Don't tell anyone about this.

660
01:23:02,824 --> 01:23:07,761
"If this news reaches home,
there will be two more deaths."

661
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:12,629
Neither his wife nor my daughter
will be able to endure this shock!

662
01:23:15,304 --> 01:23:17,295
"That is why, you please
go back from here."

663
01:24:02,484 --> 01:24:03,416
Brother!

664
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:11,748
Brother!

665
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:20,429
Why did this happen?

666
01:24:29,711 --> 01:24:33,112
"Alka, Minnie, I am leaving
father in your hands."

667
01:24:33,248 --> 01:24:35,113
Take good care of him.

668
01:24:37,519 --> 01:24:42,388
O God! What should I do now?

669
01:24:47,462 --> 01:24:51,728
"Child, you are just not
a military man's daughter..."

670
01:24:52,267 --> 01:24:55,862
A military man's daughter in law
and a wife too!

671
01:24:56,204 --> 01:25:02,404
- I know that! - And you endure
the grief of staying away from him.

672
01:25:03,412 --> 01:25:09,476
- I have to! - Being a soldier does
not mean just guarding the country.

673
01:25:10,419 --> 01:25:15,482
It's a honor, a sacrifice!"

674
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:20,286
And a soldier's family are greater
martyr's than the soldier himself!

675
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:26,100
"Because, all their life, they
tolerate this sorrow, isn't it?"

676
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:27,428
What are you trying to say?

677
01:25:43,185 --> 01:25:44,117
Suraj has become a martyr'

678
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:17,079
Why did this happen to me?

679
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:28,160
"Father, this news
should not reach there!"

680
01:26:30,165 --> 01:26:31,757
Suraj's father is a heart patient.

681
01:26:33,301 --> 01:26:35,235
He will not be able
to bear this news.

682
01:26:37,706 --> 01:26:43,508
"Father, promise me that this news
will not reach there at any cost!"

683
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:45,440
It will not.

684
01:26:50,185 --> 01:26:52,119
I must return back home.

685
01:27:45,507 --> 01:27:50,444
"Why do you leave me and go, Alka?
I don't like it without you!"

686
01:27:51,179 --> 01:27:55,115
"- I will never let you go?
- Okay, tell me, how is father?"

687
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:58,515
"He is fine, he has become a little
serious after brother has left."

688
01:27:59,254 --> 01:28:02,314
But now he will be very happy
seeing that you have returned.

689
01:28:04,059 --> 01:28:07,654
- Congratulations!
- For what?

690
01:28:08,063 --> 01:28:11,260
"We got your report after you left,
I am going to be an aunt!"

691
01:28:13,134 --> 01:28:17,264
You have a very long life! Father
was just talking about you...

692
01:28:17,405 --> 01:28:18,667
I will go and call him.

693
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,745
You have a very long life! Father
was just talking about you...

694
01:28:28,883 --> 01:28:30,077
I will go and call him.

695
01:28:30,819 --> 01:28:32,081
Why did you curse me, Minnie?"

696
01:28:34,489 --> 01:28:37,083
Why do I need this long life?

697
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:50,770
Colonel, did you break your back?"

698
01:28:53,508 --> 01:28:54,497
That has already been broken!

699
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,109
Hurry up, Alka has come!"

700
01:28:58,113 --> 01:29:02,049
Alka?! Have you
told her anything?

701
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,376
Told her what?

702
01:29:12,527 --> 01:29:15,325
What is the matter? You surely
are hiding something from me.

703
01:29:16,197 --> 01:29:18,461
- Nothing!
- Don't I know you?

704
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,591
- What is the matter?
- I said nothing!

705
01:29:20,735 --> 01:29:24,466
"Colonel, if you tell me,
you will feel better."

706
01:29:24,673 --> 01:29:26,072
I said there is nothing!

707
01:29:27,475 --> 01:29:31,468
"- Okay, why are you screaming?
- Because, you forget your status."

708
01:29:32,147 --> 01:29:36,550
You forget that you are just
a mere servant in my house!

709
01:29:37,152 --> 01:29:39,746
I am screaming because, Suraj..."

710
01:29:42,157 --> 01:29:48,096
"- What happened to Suraj?
- He has hidden from us, Bihari."

711
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:54,099
"He has gone away forever, Bihari!
He has left us shrouded in darkness!"

712
01:29:55,170 --> 01:30:00,574
- What do you mean? - He has
sacrificed his life for the country!

713
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:39,806
"- Now Alka has come home,
how can I tell her... - No!!"

714
01:30:40,682 --> 01:30:43,879
No Colonel, don't tell her."

715
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:48,485
She is carrying his gift of love...

716
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:52,748
"we had only one son,
he is not with is now..."

717
01:30:53,228 --> 01:30:55,162
but, you cannot finish your lineage."

718
01:30:57,232 --> 01:31:01,828
"For the sake of this child, we
will have to forget our sorrows."

719
01:31:03,438 --> 01:31:06,100
Colonel, don't even tell Minnie."

720
01:31:06,374 --> 01:31:08,501
"She is a child, she may
blurt out something."

721
01:31:10,779 --> 01:31:16,308
"Whenever we feel sad,
we will come here and cry."

722
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:35,592
"Colonel, keep Alka happy,
happier than before!"

723
01:31:50,418 --> 01:31:51,544
Come out!

724
01:32:01,229 --> 01:32:02,161
Get something sweet!

725
01:32:05,433 --> 01:32:09,494
Colonel's daughter in law has
come home! Call her here!

726
01:32:10,171 --> 01:32:13,299
"- Bihari, you is this woman?
- She is our daughter in law!"

727
01:32:13,441 --> 01:32:16,774
"- But, why is she walking like this?
- She is expecting a child!"

728
01:32:17,378 --> 01:32:20,506
"So, the time has come for me
to be a grandfather."

729
01:32:22,517 --> 01:32:25,179
- Father! - May you
be happy and prosper.

730
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,720
- May your husband have
a long life! - What happened?

731
01:32:29,524 --> 01:32:35,520
"Nothing, just a little cough,
...I am fine!"

732
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:45,174
"Control yourself, you cannot afford
to cry in front of everyone!"

733
01:32:45,381 --> 01:32:51,445
"Bihari, how can I control myself?
For how long should I control?"

734
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:58,050
I feel as though the entire
world is testing my patience.

735
01:33:00,063 --> 01:33:04,397
I don't have patience and
the endurance to tolerate this!

736
01:33:06,336 --> 01:33:08,668
I am completely shattered, Bihari!"

737
01:33:09,072 --> 01:33:15,011
"Colonel, you have to gather
yourself... come with me!"

738
01:33:19,015 --> 01:33:21,540
How will we manage if
you give up so soon?

739
01:33:22,151 --> 01:33:26,019
We have to hide
our feelings from Alka.

740
01:33:26,422 --> 01:33:30,358
"Whenever I feel sad,
I come here and cry alone."

741
01:33:31,094 --> 01:33:33,426
In solitude, I talk with my Suraj."

742
01:33:40,036 --> 01:33:43,301
"Whenever you feel sad,
you also come here..."

743
01:33:43,373 --> 01:33:45,034
and shed out your tears.

744
01:33:53,983 --> 01:33:56,042
"Your father was a brave man
once upon a time, son..."

745
01:33:58,121 --> 01:34:01,989
he faced many hardships
and sorrows...

746
01:34:03,326 --> 01:34:07,387
but, he cannot bear your death!"

747
01:34:09,599 --> 01:34:17,335
"When I look at Alka, I know I am
cheating her but, for how long?"

748
01:34:19,075 --> 01:34:26,675
You believed that it is a sin
for a young woman to be a widow.

749
01:34:28,084 --> 01:34:30,211
"But, how can I tell her
that she is a widow?"

750
01:34:31,287 --> 01:34:36,020
"If you have the courage, you come
here and wipe out her vermilion!"

751
01:34:37,093 --> 01:34:39,152
Come and break her bangles!

752
01:34:40,229 --> 01:34:46,031
Tell her that she is a widow
and she should forget you.

753
01:34:50,373 --> 01:34:52,967
Bihari, what should I do?"

754
01:34:55,244 --> 01:34:56,302
Stop crying!

755
01:35:00,249 --> 01:35:02,183
"Why didn't you throw this earlier,
I would have finished the game!"

756
01:35:05,254 --> 01:35:07,586
It's quite late, we are leaving now."

757
01:35:09,058 --> 01:35:11,390
You should keep coming often.

758
01:35:11,527 --> 01:35:13,995
Sure! Get up!

759
01:35:14,130 --> 01:35:16,655
Aren't you forgetting something?

760
01:35:18,067 --> 01:35:20,399
- I am forgetting?! - Didn't
you come here to say something?

761
01:35:21,671 --> 01:35:24,606
- Say something?!
- Stop pretending!

762
01:35:25,008 --> 01:35:28,603
"- Talk to Alka.
- Oh, that?"

763
01:35:29,078 --> 01:35:32,206
"Listen to him, he selects a girl
without telling anyone..."

764
01:35:32,415 --> 01:35:35,009
then he falls in love discreetly...

765
01:35:35,418 --> 01:35:37,352
"but, he cannot talk
about marriage himself!"

766
01:35:38,221 --> 01:35:40,951
- Whose marriage are you
talking about? - Uncle!

767
01:35:42,959 --> 01:35:47,555
"I am young for this but, I want
Minnie's hand for Vijay in marriage."

768
01:35:53,236 --> 01:35:56,228
I know that our family doesn't have
the same status as your family.

769
01:35:56,372 --> 01:35:59,307
Your husband broke the age old
orthodox norms of the society...

770
01:36:00,043 --> 01:36:02,034
he gave support to a woman
who had no future...

771
01:36:02,178 --> 01:36:04,043
"in my eyes, his family is
of a very high status!"

772
01:36:05,181 --> 01:36:07,979
"I agree to this match,
you send Vijay's horoscope."

773
01:36:50,626 --> 01:36:55,962
I am in love, tell me what to do?"

774
01:37:05,441 --> 01:37:11,175
"Life has become impossible,
tell me what to do?""

775
01:38:08,037 --> 01:38:11,495
"Seeing you, I fell
in love with you!""

776
01:38:11,707 --> 01:38:15,165
Our eyes met and I lost my peace!

777
01:38:29,125 --> 01:38:32,993
Love has made me very restless!

778
01:38:33,196 --> 01:38:36,996
I cannot bear to be away from you!

779
01:38:38,668 --> 01:38:44,004
"Now we are in love,
tell me what to do?""

780
01:39:38,995 --> 01:39:42,590
"I will not listen
to what people say!""

781
01:39:42,932 --> 01:39:46,459
"It's my heart's agony,
nobody can help me!""

782
01:40:00,149 --> 01:40:03,676
"In our passion, we have
abandoned the world!""

783
01:40:04,086 --> 01:40:07,954
"I have given you
place in my heart!""

784
01:40:09,558 --> 01:40:15,224
"Even I agree to that,
tell me what to do?""

785
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:45,650
I have never seen any two
horoscopes matching so well!

786
01:40:46,195 --> 01:40:48,925
Very rarely does
God make such pairs!

787
01:40:49,332 --> 01:40:52,597
You have no idea what the outcome
of their marriage will be?

788
01:40:53,002 --> 01:40:55,664
"Then let's not delay, quickly
tell me the auspicious wedding date."

789
01:40:57,006 --> 01:40:59,668
There is no immediate date.

790
01:41:00,009 --> 01:41:03,945
"The planetary position is not right,
it will change after Karvachauth'."

791
01:41:06,215 --> 01:41:09,946
Why do you have to go to the
Colonel's house to break the fast?

792
01:41:10,219 --> 01:41:13,620
"You don't know, it's
an age old tradition..."

793
01:41:14,023 --> 01:41:17,481
"on this day, all women gather and
go to his house to see the moon."

794
01:42:00,002 --> 01:42:03,938
Do it gently. Why must you show
your strength in everything you do?

795
01:42:04,006 --> 01:42:08,340
- I enjoy it! - What is
enjoyable about combing hair?

796
01:42:08,544 --> 01:42:10,478
I am bribing you to say yes.

797
01:42:12,081 --> 01:42:15,346
- I am not going to agree to
anything today. - Think again!

798
01:42:15,951 --> 01:42:17,543
- You will regret.
- Of course not!

799
01:42:17,686 --> 01:42:18,948
I am going to be
here for a few days!

800
01:42:20,956 --> 01:42:24,016
Watch what you say!

801
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:27,687
I am saying the truth... I
will leave on the 24th.

802
01:42:32,968 --> 01:42:36,301
What happened to you?

803
01:42:36,972 --> 01:42:38,963
Why do you remind me of that date?

804
01:42:42,244 --> 01:42:48,308
"You will go but, have you thought
how I will spend one whole year?"

805
01:42:49,251 --> 01:42:53,051
The way I spend... remembering you!

806
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:58,383
"- Memories are merciless!
- No, memories are generous!"

807
01:43:00,062 --> 01:43:02,656
Just remember me and embrace me.

808
01:43:03,065 --> 01:43:06,000
- Then why do you want to go?
- Even the sun is away from us!

809
01:43:06,535 --> 01:43:08,662
"But, it spreads
it's radiance all around."

810
01:43:12,208 --> 01:43:16,611
- What are you doing?
- I am giving you my radiance!

811
01:43:33,095 --> 01:43:41,503
"Life has to be lived,
irrespective of joy or grief..."

812
01:43:43,372 --> 01:43:52,371
every man owes something to life!""

813
01:44:04,193 --> 01:44:12,066
One has to pay a price to smile...

814
01:44:23,078 --> 01:44:30,075
"yesterday there was a smile,
today there are tears in the eyes!""

815
01:44:46,368 --> 01:44:52,705
"Tears are which
glisten in the eyes!""

816
01:45:07,056 --> 01:45:08,045
What are you doing?

817
01:45:08,991 --> 01:45:09,980
Will you cheat the world?

818
01:45:11,126 --> 01:45:13,321
Will you commit such a big sin
on this holy day?

819
01:45:35,417 --> 01:45:40,013
"Alka, what is this?
What is the matter?!"

820
01:45:41,223 --> 01:45:42,690
Father, this is my real status!"

821
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:49,226
"I did not tell anyone but,
I have become a widow!"

822
01:45:50,232 --> 01:45:52,223
Suraj is not alive!

823
01:45:52,368 --> 01:45:53,300
No!!

824
01:45:57,973 --> 01:46:00,635
"What happened, Colonel?
Someone call the doctor!"

825
01:46:13,589 --> 01:46:18,322
I will not live without
my father and brother.

826
01:46:25,067 --> 01:46:28,002
Minnie... open the door!!

827
01:46:37,413 --> 01:46:40,473
If this vermilion
can save two lives...

828
01:46:41,617 --> 01:46:43,346
I will apply it on my forehead.

829
01:46:44,353 --> 01:46:48,221
"If this is a sin,
I don't mind committing it!"

830
01:46:52,695 --> 01:46:55,687
The moon won't come out soon if
you keep looking at the sky!

831
01:46:56,031 --> 01:46:58,158
"I know but, this
wait is never ending."

832
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:01,959
There, finally it's over."

833
01:47:15,250 --> 01:47:19,653
"Alka, divert our mind, sing the same
song you sang on Durga pooja' day."

834
01:47:23,125 --> 01:47:25,320
I don't feel like it.

835
01:47:25,661 --> 01:47:27,390
Her mind is with her husband.

836
01:47:27,529 --> 01:47:29,656
"Right, on that day Suraj
was sitting next to her."

837
01:47:31,133 --> 01:47:34,534
Think of Suraj and sing a song.

838
01:47:35,738 --> 01:47:37,330
Go and get Suraj's photograph.

839
01:48:30,192 --> 01:48:34,652
My beloved resides in my breath...

840
01:48:35,063 --> 01:48:39,124
I have taken an oath
from my beloved...

841
01:48:50,345 --> 01:48:54,941
we will live together
for several births...

842
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:59,013
"be it joy or sorrow,
we will share it!""

843
01:49:35,257 --> 01:49:39,990
Whenever I am born...

844
01:49:40,128 --> 01:49:44,929
I hope to get him in my life!""

845
01:50:00,949 --> 01:50:05,682
My life is for him...

846
01:50:06,021 --> 01:50:10,014
all my joys are for him!""

847
01:50:11,093 --> 01:50:15,359
"All I want is to
see him in front of me!""

848
01:51:21,964 --> 01:51:30,565
"I pray to God to
bestow my life upon him!""

849
01:51:46,455 --> 01:51:50,653
Whether he is near me or away...

850
01:51:51,059 --> 01:51:55,462
he is my life!""

851
01:51:56,198 --> 01:52:01,192
Our love can never separate us!

852
01:52:58,727 --> 01:53:00,661
Father, where did you go away?"

853
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,060
"Father, why are you eyes red?
Have you cried?"

854
01:53:09,071 --> 01:53:12,063
Yes, I have cried a lot today!"

855
01:53:13,408 --> 01:53:15,603
"What is the matter father,
why did you cry?"

856
01:53:17,412 --> 01:53:18,344
I remembered someone!

857
01:53:20,749 --> 01:53:21,681
Whom did you remember?

858
01:53:26,088 --> 01:53:27,419
Whom did you remember, Colonel?"

859
01:53:29,224 --> 01:53:31,419
Suraj's mother!

860
01:53:37,099 --> 01:53:41,502
"On this day, even she used to
pray for my long life."

861
01:53:43,038 --> 01:53:46,496
"Praying for my life,
her own life span reduced."

862
01:53:48,043 --> 01:53:54,039
"Why do people do such things,
why do they leave and go away?"

863
01:53:55,984 --> 01:54:00,250
"Father, what is wrong with you,
why are you making us cry?"

864
01:54:00,388 --> 01:54:04,518
"Colonel, don't you dare
shed one more tear!"

865
01:54:05,127 --> 01:54:11,999
"- Look, even Alka is crying!
- Alright, I will not cry."

866
01:54:13,068 --> 01:54:14,399
I promise I will not cry.

867
01:54:17,072 --> 01:54:19,666
"After I get Minnie married,
even I will go away!"

868
01:54:20,742 --> 01:54:24,678
"Father, please don't
say such things."

869
01:54:30,485 --> 01:54:31,679
It looks so nice!

870
01:54:33,688 --> 01:54:36,156
- When will that be printed?
- When you die!

871
01:54:36,758 --> 01:54:38,020
Shut up! You think
I will die as a bachelor?

872
01:54:39,561 --> 01:54:43,554
"Until Chaudhry doesn't get married,
he will not marry his daughter."

873
01:54:44,299 --> 01:54:46,699
- You look for another girl.
- Okay... Shut up!

874
01:54:47,035 --> 01:54:48,297
I cannot be unfaithful to Guddi!

875
01:54:48,436 --> 01:54:49,494
Then you will die a bachelor!

876
01:54:51,373 --> 01:54:55,241
- Colonel has sent a diary with
names and addresses. - You can go!

877
01:54:56,244 --> 01:55:00,305
10 days are left for the wedding
and the first name is Suraj Dutt!

878
01:55:05,253 --> 01:55:13,058
"This means, Colonel is has yet,
hidden this matter from his family."

879
01:55:14,262 --> 01:55:16,730
I think we all should
attend this wedding.

880
01:55:17,065 --> 01:55:20,466
"But sir, what will you answer when
they'll ask why Suraj did not come?"

881
01:55:21,136 --> 01:55:25,732
"We will think about that later but,
we will surely attend the wedding!"

882
01:55:26,074 --> 01:55:29,407
"Sir, will the Commander
give us a holiday together."

883
01:55:31,213 --> 01:55:33,010
I will talk to the Commander.

884
01:55:33,215 --> 01:55:36,548
"After all, Suraj's sister
is our sister too!"

885
01:55:40,355 --> 01:55:41,287
Please hurry up!

886
01:55:42,357 --> 01:55:43,949
I think Suraj has come.

887
01:56:00,242 --> 01:56:04,303
"Welcome, soldiers!
I cannot see Suraj."

888
01:56:06,114 --> 01:56:09,379
"Sir, he received an order to go
on a very important mission."

889
01:56:10,252 --> 01:56:14,245
- He'll be here in a day or two.
- He knows it's his sister's wedding.

890
01:56:14,389 --> 01:56:15,515
He has only one sister!

891
01:56:16,191 --> 01:56:18,659
Uncle, military job is such..."

892
01:56:19,127 --> 01:56:22,392
"our duty is towards our motherland,
other relations come later!"

893
01:56:22,998 --> 01:56:25,466
"- Isn't it, Colonel?
- You are right."

894
01:56:27,002 --> 01:56:28,993
But they don't agree
to these justifications.

895
01:56:30,338 --> 01:56:34,672
"A sister cannot forgive her brother.
You cannot evade the truth, Khan."

896
01:56:36,077 --> 01:56:39,672
"But sometimes, It gets
difficult to say the truth."

897
01:56:40,615 --> 01:56:44,949
"Anyway, come in... you
please handle the work here."

898
01:56:48,023 --> 01:56:52,619
You all go and work outside... and
you girls go and sing outside!

899
01:56:54,029 --> 01:56:56,623
Sit here... please don't mind!

900
01:57:04,039 --> 01:57:07,975
You are aware of everything.

901
01:57:10,378 --> 01:57:16,647
"But, nobody in this house or
this town, knows the truth!"

902
01:57:19,254 --> 01:57:25,056
"By coming here, you'll have filled
the vacuum created by Suraj."

903
01:57:27,195 --> 01:57:33,065
"But, once the wedding
is over then..."

904
01:57:33,201 --> 01:57:34,327
Father!

905
01:57:41,676 --> 01:57:44,543
"Father, what are you doing here,
the sweet maker is asking for sugar."

906
01:57:44,679 --> 01:57:48,615
Suraj's friends were cracking
jokes that made me laugh and...

907
01:57:49,150 --> 01:57:51,277
she is Minnie, it's her wedding."

908
01:57:51,619 --> 01:57:54,144
"They all are his friends, they
have got his message for you."

909
01:57:54,289 --> 01:57:58,282
"Father, I will talk
to them but now, you go!"

910
01:58:00,962 --> 01:58:04,363
"- Minnie, Suraj has said...
- I know everything!"

911
01:58:05,967 --> 01:58:07,366
I know my brother is not alive.

912
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:15,703
"I received the telegram
but, I burnt it!"

913
01:58:18,046 --> 01:58:20,037
Everyone is longing to meet him.

914
01:58:22,050 --> 01:58:27,386
"But, nobody knows that
he is not alive..."

915
01:58:36,998 --> 01:58:40,456
- Why are you calling me?
- Your friends are calling you.

916
01:58:40,602 --> 01:58:42,593
"Forget them, Suraj's
friends are sitting here."

917
01:58:44,005 --> 01:58:45,267
- Hello.
- Hello!

918
01:58:45,407 --> 01:58:47,272
- You go outside.
- Alright.

919
01:58:50,545 --> 01:58:53,605
"Sister in law,
Suraj has sent us here."

920
01:58:54,149 --> 01:58:57,346
He will come home in a day or two.

921
01:58:58,153 --> 01:58:59,347
You please sit.

922
01:59:03,358 --> 01:59:07,294
I have to keep waiting all my life.

923
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:13,296
"You perhaps don't know but,
my father is also a Colonel."

924
01:59:16,037 --> 01:59:20,371
I had received the news
about Suraj long back.

925
01:59:23,378 --> 01:59:25,642
I told my father not to tell anyone.

926
01:59:28,650 --> 01:59:34,646
"That is why, everyone... and
for their happiness, I..."

927
01:59:37,258 --> 01:59:39,317
I cannot even cry at my own fate!

928
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:43,461
My father in law is
a heart patient...

929
01:59:44,332 --> 01:59:50,669
and Minnie... I just
want her to get married...

930
01:59:53,141 --> 01:59:58,602
"till then, we will
have to keep Suraj alive!"

931
02:00:06,020 --> 02:00:10,013
Is this a family of
angels or human beings?

932
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:15,357
O Almighty! The light of such
houses should never burn out!

933
02:00:29,043 --> 02:00:34,572
Leaving her father's house...

934
02:00:35,250 --> 02:00:40,187
"the daughter is heading towards
the house of her beloved!""

935
02:00:57,005 --> 02:01:05,470
"It is such a irony of fate,
is it union or a separation?""

936
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:23,555
"She will leave behind the toys
of her childhood days!""

937
02:02:25,693 --> 02:02:36,035
"She will miss the tales of
the prince and the princess!""

938
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:49,039
"Her tears cannot
repay her memories!""

939
02:04:14,202 --> 02:04:20,334
Father's house is
a temporary place...

940
02:04:20,742 --> 02:04:25,076
"a daughter cannot
live there forever!""

941
02:04:27,281 --> 02:04:33,413
A father conducts
the marriage of his daughter...

942
02:04:33,621 --> 02:04:38,024
in the absence of his son!""

943
02:04:40,228 --> 02:04:46,224
Tears cannot be controlled...

944
02:04:47,034 --> 02:04:50,970
eyes keep crying!""

945
02:06:16,591 --> 02:06:17,319
Father!

946
02:06:19,727 --> 02:06:22,719
Father, can I tell you something?"

947
02:06:23,064 --> 02:06:25,589
"- Tell me, child.
- Get Alka married again!"

948
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,058
"Even I was thinking
the same, child."

949
02:06:45,553 --> 02:06:47,282
No, my child!"

950
02:07:09,710 --> 02:07:13,703
"Colonel, I told you that I will
not break this alliance!"

951
02:07:15,983 --> 02:07:17,314
Go and get your bride!

952
02:07:20,988 --> 02:07:23,320
Father!!

953
02:07:40,341 --> 02:07:41,273
Leave me!!

954
02:07:41,609 --> 02:07:46,342
"I swear upon the Almighty, we'll not
let you succeed in your evil mission!"

955
02:07:47,615 --> 02:07:50,209
Leave my sister...

956
02:07:50,418 --> 02:07:52,943
or you all will die here!

957
02:07:53,287 --> 02:07:54,948
Hey! Shoot them all!

958
02:08:10,171 --> 02:08:11,297
Minnie, run away!"

959
02:08:12,039 --> 02:08:12,971
Father!

960
02:08:50,344 --> 02:08:51,936
Cheetah, get the bride!"

961
02:08:53,147 --> 02:08:59,017
"- No, leave me!!
- Leave her!!"

962
02:09:00,021 --> 02:09:01,352
Leave me, you rascal!"

963
02:09:05,359 --> 02:09:06,621
"- Leave me!
- Come on, drive!"

964
02:09:50,604 --> 02:09:53,129
Leave me!

965
02:10:31,178 --> 02:10:32,110
Tie him up!

966
02:10:34,181 --> 02:10:39,175
- Help! - Now you see how I
enjoy myself with your bride.

967
02:10:40,321 --> 02:10:41,583
Leave her, you rascal!"

968
02:10:44,325 --> 02:10:45,986
- No!
- No!!

969
02:10:54,335 --> 02:10:55,267
No!!

970
02:11:00,541 --> 02:11:01,337
Leave her!

971
02:11:14,021 --> 02:11:16,956
No! Leave me!!

972
02:11:33,641 --> 02:11:34,369
Brother!

973
02:11:56,664 --> 02:11:59,997
Brother?!!

974
02:12:22,022 --> 02:12:23,956
No... leave me!"

975
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:08,524
Son! What have I done?

976
02:14:09,063 --> 02:14:10,997
I shot you with my own hands?

977
02:14:11,398 --> 02:14:14,060
"Son, I traded this country
to buy happiness for you."

978
02:14:14,201 --> 02:14:18,661
"I became a traitor... son,
don't leave me and go!"

979
02:14:19,073 --> 02:14:20,404
I don't have anyone else
besides you!

980
02:14:36,090 --> 02:14:37,022
Brother!

981
02:15:16,397 --> 02:15:20,390
- How come you all are here?!
- We received her wedding card.

982
02:15:21,135 --> 02:15:25,003
"We thought that she should not
miss her brother so, we came here."

983
02:15:25,205 --> 02:15:28,402
"Suraj, I myself saw a hand
grenade bursting on you..."

984
02:15:29,276 --> 02:15:30,072
then how did you save yourself?

985
02:15:32,413 --> 02:15:33,402
How did I save myself?

986
02:15:47,027 --> 02:15:48,358
"I wonder how many days,
I was unconscious..."

987
02:15:48,495 --> 02:15:51,362
"when I regained my senses,
I was captivated by the enemy."

988
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,662
"And before they would capture me,
I had crossed the border."

989
02:16:30,137 --> 02:16:34,665
I will never ask God
for anything all my life!

990
02:16:37,611 --> 02:16:41,479
- Father!
- You have made us cry a lot.

991
02:16:43,083 --> 02:16:47,281
"Without you, we were
living like corpses."

992
02:16:47,621 --> 02:16:48,485
No, father!"

993
02:16:52,092 --> 02:16:54,356
Even God could not bear
to separate you from us...

994
02:16:54,628 --> 02:16:57,358
and he changed the course of fate!

995
02:16:57,564 --> 02:17:00,362
"- Suraj, my son!
- Uncle Bihari!"
