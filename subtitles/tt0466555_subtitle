00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:47,291
Every now and then you fight with that Shankar Every now and then you keep on crying for him

85
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:53,041
I dont understand what qualities are there in him? From top to toe I can only see him as villain

If he had heart then he would have never troubled you like this The story that I am writing now

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,125
Oh no daddy Then who will teach me singing and music

101
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,875
Todays young generation how can be so shameless How can I know? Looking all those films

102
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,750
They all consider themselves as Raj Kappor, Shammi Kappor

103
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,833
Is this the quality of a reputed girl? To the would be husband of her

104
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:43,500
In the market full of people She slapped openly Shame on your love

105
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,333
Leave Such a crazy girl What attitude?

106
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,750
Brother if I would been in your place Then I would have caught her hairs give her 10 slaps

107
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,833
And count one Jay you should not think like this for your

108
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,125
And count one Jay you should not think like this for your

109
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,583
Would be sister-in-law Brother even if you get annoyed?

110
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:08,125
Thing that is truth should come out Facts are facts

111
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,708
Brother that girl is not normal She is completely abnormal

112
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,208
Crazy, mad, crack she is No, no No, No, no Yes,

113
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:19,000
Her whole family is mad For example take her dad Mr. Gupta

114
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,750
Dont know when he will show right and give left Sometimes purchase others fair

115
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,125
Sometimes purchase others palace Thinks of farming ideas on hill stations

116
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,375
Or suddenly becoming film director, actor or producer Starts the film company

117
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,166
If you listen to me as soon as possible You send Asha to Agra

118
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:39,958
She is not mad Jay, just hot tempered And where there is love fights quarrels are also seen

119
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,958
But brother such a fight, such a quarrel That there is no control over her anger, not on her behaviour

120
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:56,875
At least you take Asha once to your friend Dr. Paul We will know what illness she is suffering from

121
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:05,291
Jay Yes You dont worry about me If I can be kind hearted then I can be harsh too

122
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,416
Tomorrow morning I will go See that father also and daughter too

123
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,416
After all what do they think of themselves? Thats what I want?

00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:21,541
This is what is called acting Acting? I am making one film

125
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,541
In that film hero is mad I think I will do that role myself

Dont understand why Asha likes you? Look I have raised my child very lovingly

130
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:50,458
She is very near and dear to me Dont trouble her Dont take advantage of her weakness

Oh no You should be ashamed, Such educated illiterate like you

Is just weight on our mother land? Do you understand weight?

145
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:05,416
No understanding No responsibility no aim Just to run behind the girls

146
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:10,208
Sing songs Go away from here I hate your face

147
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,916

148
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,541
Then why have you come here Why are you sitting here? You told me
