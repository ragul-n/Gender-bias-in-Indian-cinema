00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:04,791
I dedicate this film to the late writer,
Mr. Ka. Si. Sivakumar

2
00:00:04,916 --> 00:00:07,875
who helped me in developing this script.
-Halitha Shameem.

3
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,541
<i>Shall I tell you a story, sir?</i>

4
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,500
<i>Hey, you...</i>

5
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:01,666
<i>I got a call last evening</i>
<i>that my dad has passed away.</i>

6
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,916
<i>Since my office is in Perungalathur,</i>

7
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,333
<i>I managed to catch</i>
<i>the last bus out of Chennai.</i>

8
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,041
<i>The man next to me kept snoring loudly.</i>

9
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,708
<i>And they kept playing</i>
<i>loud movies in the bus.</i>

10
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,166
<i>I couldn't sleep a wink.</i>

11
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,958
<i>I didn't worry about my dad's death</i>
<i>as much as I did about my lost sleep.</i>

12
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,791
His son is coming only now.

13
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:30,041
He has come to see his father's cold body.
Poor thing must be hurting so much.

14
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,083
My child...

15
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,500
Look at your father!

16
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,916
I am the first to see him dead.

17
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,041
I brought him food
thinking he must be hungry.

18
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,875
But he took his last breath in his sleep.

19
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,333
My son was longing to see you.

20
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:19,125
But you had an unresolved feud with him.

21
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,166
Had you spoken to him before he died,

22
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,708
my son wouldn't have had any regrets.

23
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,583
I wonder what my son had in mind
while breathing his last.

24
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,208
When did you arrive?

25
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,583
I got the news around 8 o'clock yesterday.
I arrived around 10 o'clock.

26
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:58,083
I couldn't visit him often
even though I stay in the next town over.

27
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:03,291
He bought Chinna's favorite snack
only last week.

28
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:08,083
He used to say that Chinna resembles you
when you were young.

29
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,083
But you didn't speak to him till the end.

30
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,166
Don't start again.

31
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,666
I'm starving.
Is there anything to eat?

32
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,208
Why do you do this?

33
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,458
I'll send you some tea if I can.

34
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,916
Okay, I'll be back.

35
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,208
Don't take the front entrance,
go this way.

36
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,541
He hasn't eaten anything since morning.
Give him some snacks.

37
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,416
Open your mouth, come on.

38
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,541
KADAIKUTTY SINGAM

39
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,666
Hey, I heard that that movie is good.

40
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,583
Yes, I heard so too.

41
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,916
It's a comedy movie.
Let's watch it later today.

42
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,916
<i>Oh, lady with a basket...</i>

43
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,458
Oh you're clicking a selfie?

44
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,000
Go take one with your crap.
Go away.

45
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,583
-We're not far, don't get down.
-It's all right.

46
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:35,583
Let's go.

47
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,625
-Hey! Praise the Lord.
-Praise the Lord.

48
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,625
-In our town...
-In our town...

49
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,833
-the late--
-Sir...

50
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,250
-Here you go.
-Let us send off

51
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,333
our beloved Muthukutty on his journey
to the afterworld...

52
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,833
Stop... You have the liquor, right?
Have it. Sit down.

53
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,541
Come, Parthy.
This way.

54
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,833
We had gone to book the photographer.
We were held back.

55
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,625
We're overseeing the rituals.

56
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:13,000
Everyone is hyped now, but if something
goes amiss, they'll create a ruckus.

57
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:16,750
-What about these old men?
-They're tossing coins to see who's next.

58
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,291
Your turn now.

59
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,125
How come you came alone?
Where's grandma?

60
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,500
She can't make it.

61
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,458
-The artists have started from Theni.
-Artists?

62
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,083
-They'll be here by noon.
-Sir.

63
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,291
Why inform him?
Aren't we the ones paying you?

64
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,500
-Let's talk.
-He might expect extra money.

65
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,875
-Come on...
-We'll take care of this.

66
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:37,958
Be strong, child.

67
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,541
The dead are not going
to come back alive.

68
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,916
Your father will surely rest in peace.

69
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,916
Could you tell me
where I can quench my thirst?

70
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,875
I'm sorry?

71
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,750
Where are the beverages served?

72
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,041
-Are you Muthukutty's son?
-Yes.

73
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,250
-I asked if you're Muthukutty's son.
-Yes, I am his son.

74
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,500
You've prospered after moving
to the city, my son.

75
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,750
I can see the change in you.

76
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,208
Parthy, this is the photo
we've given for the posters.

77
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,291
Is it okay?

78
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,250
-It's up to you.
-How could you do this?

79
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,333
What's wrong?

80
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,541
-He was speaking to me just yesterday.
-Okay.

81
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,166
He said he was leaving for home
but he has left all of us.

82
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,666
So he died after talking to you.

83
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,375
-Yes.
-What did you talk about?

84
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,791
I was talking about myself

85
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,958
that if I die on a Saturday evening, it'll
be easy for others to visit on Sunday.

86
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,708
He took my words to heart
and died peacefully.

87
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,250
-Oh...
-I meant it for myself.

88
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,750
He is asking for copyrights.
Get him some coffee.

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,500
How could you do this to me!

90
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,875
-Tell me!
-Come this way, sir.

91
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,208
-Watch your head.
-I meant it for myself.

92
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,250
-He died so suddenly.
-Yes, he did.

93
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,791
-Is the funeral today or tomorrow?
-It's today. What about yours?

94
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,333
You are a menace indeed.

95
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,375
You brat, I'll teach you a lesson.

96
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,125
I'll break your jaw.

97
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,833
Be careful, I'll tear your face apart.

98
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:46,416
Let's wait till the cremation
and pack some meat on the way back.

99
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,166
-Let's go home at our leisure.
-Okay.

100
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,041
Adjust your sari.

101
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,791
-<i>Come on, beat it...</i>
-Oh, no...

102
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,541
<i>Beat it...</i>

103
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,083
Oh, no, how could this happen...

104
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,791
What do I do?

105
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,958
Muthukutty is no more!

106
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,916
-What do we do?
-What are you glaring at?

107
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,333
I'll dig your eyes out, rascal.

108
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,375
Stay right there.

109
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,791
-Come, click a picture.
-I'll go after everyone else.

110
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,708
-Sir, come this way.
-Sir, come on.

111
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,750
-Come on, ma'am.
-Come.

112
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,041
Stay right there.

113
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:34,708
Come on.

114
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,375
-You're his son, aren't you?
-Yes.

115
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,708
Try to look sad.

116
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,666
Oh, no, you've left us...

117
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,291
Sir, let me click a selfie.

118
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,166
-Hey, move.
-You'll get beaten up.

119
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,500
-Go.
-Go away.

120
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,416
-Uncle!
-Sweetheart! Come here, come here.

121
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,250
-When did you arrive?
-Just now.

122
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,041
-Where's Chinna?
-He's playing.

123
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,416
Is he playing?
Do you want some tamarind?

124
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,416
My dear...

125
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,166
Here, have some.

126
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,458
-Eat it.
-Oh, Lord...

127
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,541
Is it sour? Really...

128
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,875
-Hey, give me some tamarind.
-Do you want some?

129
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:22,875
Give it to me.

130
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,000
-You poor thing...
-Here you go.

131
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,458
How could you leave us like this?

132
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:39,125
-Oh, Lord...
-How could you take him from us?

133
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,750
Muthukutty...

134
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,541
How could you leave us?

135
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,166
My gold tooth...
My gold tooth is missing!

136
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,583
-My gold tooth is missing!
-Oh, no, you've left us...

137
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:04,333
Move your leg. Let me check
if you're sitting on my gold tooth.

138
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,291
Move, come on.
I can't find my gold tooth.

139
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,083
You ladies, I can't find my gold tooth!

140
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:17,416
He was bent on getting my gold tooth!

141
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,416
He finally took it away
through his granddaughter.

142
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,375
You scoundrel!

143
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,916
-What's wrong with her?
-My gold tooth...

144
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,041
Why are you cursing us, you witch?

145
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,416
Go and bring Chinna.

146
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,333
Parthy, we need your grandfather's name
to publish obituary.

147
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,666
-What's your grandfather's name?
-It's Chellamuthu or Chellaiya.

148
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,291
-Wait, I'll ask Meena.
-It's Chellamuthu.

149
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,375
Don't you know your grandpa's name?

150
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,791
Your grandfather was a freedom fighter.

151
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,708
Even if we forget it,
you shouldn't forget your ancestry.

152
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,833
It's Chellamuthu.

153
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:56,333
Chellamuthu is the one who made our town
famous for its <i>boondhi</i>.

154
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,333
-Chellamuthu it is.
-Okay, I'll do it.

155
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,750
Sir, I like your ring tone.
Do you have Bluetooth?

156
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,583
I have a gold tooth.
Want it?

157
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,125
-You'll pay me as promised, right?
-Yes, we will.

158
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,958
-You'll let me go by 3 pm, right?
-Just sing for an hour and you can go.

159
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,750
She is the one who sings mourning songs.
Come on.

160
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,250
-She has come from Madurai to sing.
-Are you here to sing?

161
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,541
<i>Let me go before 3 pm,</i>
<i>I need to go to another funeral...</i>

162
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,291
So you've got appointments?

163
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,208
What is his name?

164
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,791
What was his occupation?

165
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,166
His name is Muthukutty,
he used to sell ice cream.

166
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,958
His daughter's name is Meena
and son's name is Parthy.

167
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:52,708
<i>Oh sweet Muthukutty, you made</i>
<i>Everyone happy with your ice cream</i>

168
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,625
<i>Oh sweet Muthukutty,</i>
<i>You raised Parthy and Meena</i>

169
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,750
<i>With so much care</i>

170
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:07,500
<i>When you rode your bicycle</i>
<i>Selling ice cream</i>

171
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:11,833
<i>Everyone looked at you with awe</i>

172
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,541
<i>The whole world turned its head</i>
<i>To look at you</i>

173
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:23,625
<i>But you have left all of us behind</i>

174
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,375
<i>Oh, sweet Muthukutty...</i>

175
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:32,166
<i>Muthukutty, wherever you are,</i>
<i>come to the main entrance.</i>

176
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,791
<i>We request Muthukutty</i>
<i>to come to the main entrance.</i>

177
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,291
I heard it again.
They're looking for our dad.

178
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,166
-They say that he is missing.
-He is not a child, he'll be around here.

179
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,708
Who else would search for him
when we are right here?

180
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,958
Sir, I want to get down.

181
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,958
-Sir.
-What is it, child?

182
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,125
Muthukutty is our father.
We heard that he is missing.

183
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,083
Isn't he here?
I've announced it four times.

184
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,291
Chandru, hold the mic.
Let me come there.

185
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,875
Come, let me check.

186
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,791
-Where's the one who gave this paper?
-He was dancing.

187
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,916
He's dancing here.

188
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,666
Hey, you...

189
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,458
Who are you to Muthukutty?

190
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,166
-Why do you ask?
-You complained that he is missing.

191
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,000
His children are searching for him.

192
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,250
But you're dancing here without a care.

193
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,708
Didn't I ask you to play silently?

194
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:25,166
-What are you doing here?
-I warned her but she started crying, Dad.

195
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,708
-Dad?
-Yes, I am their dad.

196
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:31,000
I am Muthukutty.
I wanted to hear name over the boombox.

197
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,833
What is wrong in that?
It was just for fun.

198
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,291
Oh, God! You're playing
with my bread and butter here.

199
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,041
<i>Beat it...</i>

200
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,625
-Sikkim.
-Sikkim.

201
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,541
-Bhutan.
-Bhutan.

202
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,791
-Manipur.
-Manipur.

203
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,458
-Assam.
-Assam.

204
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,958
Royal diamond.

205
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,125
Dad, they didn't teach me
about this place in my school.

206
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,250
They wouldn't know it.

207
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,750
Superb, Dad!
You know everything about the world.

208
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,583
Everything is right here.

209
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,125
Dad, everyone in my class has bought
the answer guide.

210
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,125
I am the only one who hasn't.
My teacher chides me about it.

211
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,750
-Tell me who it is, I'll deal with them.
-No.

212
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,500
-Just get me the answer guide.
-All right.

213
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,166
Why involve caste in answer guides?

214
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,541
Sir, get us the answer guide
for sixth grade.

215
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,125
Get the answer guide.

216
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,958
Paranthaman, car driver.

217
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,000
Passed away in 1998.

218
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,583
Oh, Lord.
Dhurian, car broker.

219
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,208
He passed away in 2002.

220
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,458
Hey, what's that written in English?

221
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,208
It says "PN", Dad.

222
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,583
-What about that one?
-It says the same.

223
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,250
If they have the same initials, then...

224
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:42,958
-Sir.
-Yes?

225
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:46,083
Dhurian from this town who died last year

226
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,125
and Paranthaman who died in 1998...
Were they brothers?

227
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,333
I've heard about them.
But I don't know if they were brothers.

228
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,583
You don't...

229
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,541
Paranthaman was a driver here.
He died of a heart attack.

230
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,625
I don't know
if he was Dhurian's brother.

231
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,458
Dad, I'm getting late for school.
Let's go.

232
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,458
Yes, don't be hasty.
Come on.

233
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,208
This is a kind of knowledge too.
Not everything is learned from books.

234
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,875
I know several things, right?

235
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,666
-Were Dhurian and Paranthaman brothers?
-I don't know.

236
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,916
Everyone has ganged up against me.

237
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,166
They must have been brothers.
These guys don't know.

238
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,958
{\an8}People tend to forget the dead
quite easily.

00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,750

00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,791
<i>You can buy a car and travel in class!</i>

242
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,500
<i>You can brag and boast.</i>

243
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,833
<i>The Goddess of Wealth calls you.</i>

244
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,458
Jesus calls us here.

245
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:43,166
The Goddess of Wealth calls us there.
Let's see what She has to offer.

246
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,958
-Hi, sir!
-Hi, Muthukutty!

247
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,875
-What happened to the lottery pool?
-Don't get me started.

248
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,750
The whole thing backfired on me.

249
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,666
Why don't you pool with me?
Five of us can split a ticket of Rs. 50.

250
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,333
-Cooperating for mutual benefits.
-Dad, that's wrong.

251
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,000
-Cooperation is a survival strategy.
-Shut up.

252
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,875
I only have the bus fare.
Add these under my tab.

253
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,750
Let me take them now.
I'll pay you next time.

254
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,500
What do I do if you run away?

255
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:25,750
I don't even trust the locals.
And you are from the next town.

256
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,041
-Why don't you give me some collateral?
-Collateral?

257
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,708
M PARTHY

258
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,416
-Dad!
-I bought this just now for Rs. 25.

259
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,291
I'll take it from your son next week.

260
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,583
Here, take it inside.

261
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,208
Strike his name.

262
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:50,250
Why are you breathing heavily?
Let's strike off his name next week.

263
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,000
If I win, you don't have
to go to a public school.

264
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,250
I'll send you to a private school.

265
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,416
It's in your best interest.

266
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,708
My sweetheart.

267
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,041
-Ice cream!
-Hey, Muthukutty.

268
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,291
Hey, gorgeous!
Come on.

269
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,583
-Here.
-Give me a rose milk flavored one.

270
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,166
Is one enough?
Here you go.

271
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,375
Have it before your grandchildren
find out.

272
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:24,333
This goes on your tab too?
Whom do I ask if you die suddenly?

273
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,333
Don't you want an ice cream?

274
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,125
I do, but I don't have money.

275
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,458
Did I ask you to pay, Naachiya?

276
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:39,750
They wouldn't give me money to buy
ice cream from you as it's unhealthy.

277
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:42,458
Unhealthy?

278
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,541
They gave me this, but I don't like it.
I want a Popsicle.

279
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,458
Um... I'll give you a Popsicle.

280
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,083
Will you give me this?

281
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,375
<i>Hey, you...</i>

282
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,708
Ta-da!

283
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,583
Wow.

284
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,666
-Bye, Mr. Ice Cream Man!
-Bye, sweetheart.

285
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,833
Get two balls of ice cream tomorrow.

286
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,625
AELAY ICE CREAM

287
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,083
It's fragrant inside.

288
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,541
<i>Hey, you...</i>

289
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:38,041
-I'm a Complan boy!
-I'm a Complan girl!

290
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,125
-I did it right.
-I did it better.

291
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,375
-I did it better than you.
-No, I did it.

292
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,125
-Parthy!
-I did it right.

293
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,416
-Here's a ball to play with.
-Wow!

294
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,541
-Let me see.
-It looks pretty.

295
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,291
Yes, it looks really pretty.

296
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,708
-Shall we plant a seed in it?
-Let's play.

297
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,333
Panickampatti. Here it is.

298
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,291
-Get in.
-Okay.

299
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,666
-Am I short enough for the half-ticket?
-Yes, you are.

300
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,250
Seven there and seven here.

301
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,500
This is the middle seat.

302
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,333
We'd be safe from accidents.

303
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,833
Our skulls will be safe.

304
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,000
Okay, you stay right here.
I'll be back.

305
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,250
Stay here, okay?
I'll be right back.

306
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,666
Good morning, ma'am.

307
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,250
Good morning, Parthy.

308
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:33,791
Thanks, ma'am.

309
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,958
Dad, they're starting the bus.
Make it quick!

310
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,791
-Come on!
-I'm here...

311
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:57,000
-They wouldn't dare leave your dad behind.
-Don't keep the basket on the seat.

312
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,125
Get another ticket otherwise.

313
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:04,000
-Kalavathy!
-Hey, Prabha, come. How are you?

314
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,083
-I'm fine.
-You got transferred...

315
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,166
Hey, who is that smoking in the bus?

316
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,291
If I catch you,
I'll kick you out of the bus.

317
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:13,375
Did you have to pay for it?

318
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:15,750
Hey, I had blocked this seat.

319
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:18,833
Oh, is it you who blocked the seat?

320
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,125
I thought it was the government.

321
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,333
Hey, fatso.
You can laugh later.

322
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,125
Where are my slippers?

323
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:31,875
Placing your slippers on the seat
doesn't make the seat yours.

324
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,750
-It does.
-Not anymore.

325
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,791
I threw away your slippers
to teach you a lesson.

326
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,333
What! Y-You threw them away?

327
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,125
Yes, what about it now?

328
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,583
I have to worship you.

329
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,583
How dare you sit on the seat I blocked
and tease me about it?

330
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,166
You don't have to teach me
a lesson, you glutton.

331
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:51,833
-Hey, don't you dare call me names!
-Dad...

332
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,625
-How dare you...
-Stop it, Dad. Please.

333
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,708
-What is it?
-She is my teacher.

334
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:59,250
Oh, is she a teacher?

335
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,666
No wonder my son fails all his subjects.

336
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,375
If you eat salt, you must drink water.

337
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:08,541
-Stop it, Dad.
-This expanding glutton is a teacher.

338
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,666
Hey, Muthukutty!
Why are you troubling her?

339
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,208
Hey, you do your duty and I'll do mine.

340
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,166
It's a given that I should ask this.

341
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,500
Is it wrong to use my slippers
to book a seat?

342
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,500
-Everyone's looking.
-Get my slippers back

343
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,958
or turn the bus around.
She has thrown them away.

344
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,541
I am sloshed.
Yet I'm speaking with patience.

345
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,625
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-Kick them out.

346
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,250
-Who was that?
-Stop the bus.

347
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,833
This guy is causing a scene.

348
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:35,916
This is nothing.
Stop the bus, turn it around.

349
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,166
Listen to me.
Don't cause trouble.

350
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,000
-Just get down already.
-Get down?

351
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,166
-Go find them.
-All of you are in on this.

352
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,458
Find them yourself.

353
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,416
If she is the one teaching,
my son won't go anywhere in life.

354
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,083
-Get down.
-Everyone's looking.

355
00:24:48,166 --> 00:24:50,791
Let me see how you drive again
on this road.

356
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,916
Be careful! You messed with the wrong guy.

357
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,500
I'll teach you a lesson.

358
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,916
My sweetheart, come on.
What is this?

359
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,791
Did you contract bird flu?

360
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,541
Who is it?

361
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,208
Hey, you!

362
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,250
You are up to something.

363
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:13,875
I'm not up to anything. Somebody
asked me directions to your house.

364
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:16,125
-Who was it?
-Somebody from Thirumangalam.

365
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:19,541
-Did you tell him?
-I told him that you're home.

366
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,541
It hurts...

367
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,875
-What happened, Dad?
-My chest hurts.

368
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,916
-Bring the grandma from next door.
-Dad.

369
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,291
Run! Oh, God...

370
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:41,750
Only when you fall sick do you realize
the significance of a wife.

371
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,625
You should have remarried
at least to keep yourself in check.

372
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,708
The jaundice took your wife.

373
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,916
You are raising your children
as a single dad.

374
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,625
But you don't know
how to hold your tongue.

375
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:59,666
You poke your nose in everyone's business
and meddle in other's affairs...

376
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:02,625
-Hey, move aside.
-...as a hobby.

377
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:07,125
Your cholesterol levels
have gone up and caused this.

378
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:11,083
Make him drink this potion
a little at a time.

379
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,750
I'll ask my son to bring a vehicle.

380
00:26:14,875 --> 00:26:19,750
We must visit Dr. Kanagaraj
to get him treated.

381
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:22,416
We shouldn't take chest pains lightly.

382
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,625
Here, get him a bottle of soda.

383
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,791
Hey, Muthukutty.

384
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,625
I'll visit you when you're feeling better.

385
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,125
-I'll take your leave.
-Sure, sir.

386
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:40,000
People experiencing chest pains should
be careful. They may die anytime.

387
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,666
It's common in his age though.

388
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:45,916
Did he leave?

389
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,458
Were you scared?

390
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,791
-Why are you getting up?
-The money lender came unannounced.

391
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:56,083
-Give it to me.
-He did it to fool the money lender.

392
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,208
How funny!

393
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,333
Even the greatest actors
don't stand a chance.

394
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:05,125
He gave them a run for their money.

395
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,291
Were the children in on the act?

396
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,208
What are you laughing at?
Get lost.

397
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,333
Go home.
Don't you have anything better to do?

398
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:16,541
Hey, why are you crying?
Do you love me so much?

399
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,125
Is this how you'd cry for me?

400
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:22,375
Is this how you'll cry when I die?

401
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,458
But this is not enough for me.

402
00:27:26,416 --> 00:27:27,333
Don't cry.

403
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,291
Forget it.

404
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,541
Muthukutty, is everything ready?

405
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,041
Everything is ready.

406
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,541
Close your tab today.

407
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,041
We're so close.

408
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:58,083
-You still have to pay.
-Don't do this over a piece of bun.

409
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,333
How could you?

410
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,541
LIQUOR PRICES INCREASE BY 3%

411
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,208
They've increased the price of our fuel.

412
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,291
MANI TEA STALL

413
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:20,333
Stay right on the road, okay?

414
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,541
Eat your fill.

415
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:35,750
Someone has staked
a rooster over there.

416
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:43,875
Someone's coming.

417
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:55,166
Hey! Didn't I ask you to stay on the road?

418
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,208
Hey...

419
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:58,916
Hey...

420
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,208
You're running like an athlete.

421
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,625
Stand right there, okay?

422
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:15,916
Hey, look over there. Your dad
is playing with chicks on the road.

423
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,666
The plan worked!

424
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,458
Oh, no...

425
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:43,166
My hen! You murderer!

426
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,958
-I didn't run over it.
-Did my hen commit suicide then?

427
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,375
It wasn't even a hen, it was a chick.

428
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:51,000
How can you prove it
now that you've run over it?

429
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,916
-Pay me Rs. 500.
-Rs. 500?

430
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:55,750
My hen was about to lay eggs.

431
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,333
Sir, I'm an honorable teacher.

432
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:01,250
-I teach kids for a living.
-I raise hens for a living.

433
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,458
I don't have Rs. 500,
I have only Rs. 300.

434
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:07,916
Give me what you have then.
I'm sure you'll run over it again.

435
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:13,041
Take it out.
Stop counting already.

436
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,791
See how cunning your dad is?

437
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:23,833
This is why we should take
real good care of our chicks.

438
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,791
He takes real good care to kill them.

439
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:27,666
Settle my tab.

440
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:30,833
-Come on.
-All your sins will go to your son.

441
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,208
I've been saving up since last Diwali.
I should've kept it hidden.

442
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,291
He has stolen everything.

443
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,416
I wanted to buy new clothes this year

444
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,541
instead of the usual hand-me-downs.

445
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,833
-I hate him!
-Leave it, Parthy.

446
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,916
Let me give you an idea. Let's buy
a new piggy bank and keep it there.

447
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,458
Lord Muni will not let anyone steal it.

448
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,708
-What if Muni takes it?
-Lower your voice!

449
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,916
How dare you talk ill of Lord Muni here!

450
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,000
If He hears it, we're done for.

451
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,333
-Why?
-Don't you know about Lord Muni?

452
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,583
Don't you know about His pot full of gold?

453
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:26,208
I heard that there is a big pot
full of gold buried over there.

454
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,750
Lord Muni protects it.

455
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,875
If we sacrifice a black cat,
a pregnant cow and a young boy like you,

456
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,333
Lord Muni will voluntarily
give us the gold.

457
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,708
-Where did you hear it?
-From many sources.

458
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:38,875
-Does everyone know?
-Almost.

459
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:42,291
-What about our dad?
-I don't know if he knows about it.

460
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,375
If he does,
he would've sacrificed me.

461
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,083
Why do they only want a young boy?
Why don't they sacrifice our dad?

462
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,541
Why do you always
pee at this spot, Parthy?

463
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:55,083
It's a free flow in this spot.

464
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,875
If I don't empty my bladder,
I can't sit through the class.

465
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,208
Shall we keep the new piggy bank
near Lord Ayyanar's temple?

466
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,291
Okay, Parthy.

467
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:11,083
-Good morning, sir!
-Good morning.

468
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,166
Sit down, sit down.
Children...

469
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:18,291
He is the new teacher who will teach you
Tamil and Social subjects.

470
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:21,708
-Hey, he is the one!
-He used to teach in MHSS School...

471
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,958
He is the one who paid
for killing a chick.

472
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:25,958
-Really?
-His name is Rajendran.

473
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:28,208
-Greetings, sir.
-Let him teach now.

474
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,041
Okay, sir!

475
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,958
All right. I'll ask for your names
in the next class.

476
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,666
Let me teach you some proverbs
and their meanings now.

477
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,750
-Poor thing, he can't escape us.
-Ready?

478
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,458
-You can repeat after me, okay?
-Okay, sir.

479
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:48,458
DATE: 21-10-2003
CLASS: 6 C

480
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:50,208
Time and tide...

481
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:52,250
-Time and tide...
-He paid Rs. 300!

482
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,625
-He is going to get it bad.
-Yes.

483
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,041
...wait for none.

484
00:32:57,125 --> 00:33:00,250
Wait for none.

485
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:04,041
-A hen's tread...
-A hen's tread...

486
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,250
Let's ask if his bike can kill a chick.

487
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,333
-...won't kill the chicks.
-...won't kill the chicks.

488
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:12,375
Sir, he is asking if your bike
can't kill the chick.

489
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,291
Hey!

490
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,708
He has nowhere to go.

491
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,791
{\an8}HAPPY DIWALI

492
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:39,875
What is this?
Why are you sitting all gloomy?

493
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:43,083
See what I have bought you.

494
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:45,375
Here, eat this.
Come on.

495
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,666
I've bought you a lot of fireworks.

496
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:49,416
Here's a toy gun.

497
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:54,500
Keep this.

498
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,291
Look, I got you new clothes.

499
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:01,208
For your sister as well.
Wear the new clothes and show them off.

500
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,791
That will make me proud.

501
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:15,375
-Do you think he stole from the temple?
-Keep quiet. He might hear us.

502
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,833
Parthy, come here.

503
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:30,458
I'll take you to someone's house.
There is a TV and many toys.

504
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:31,958
You can play there.

505
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:35,416
-What about Meena?
-Let her play here. Come on.

506
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,458
Sit here.

507
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,375
Get down.

508
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,125
-Who is this, Dad?
-I'll tell you, wait.

509
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:59,291
-Hi.
-Parthy! How are you, dear?

510
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,000
-I'm good.
-Stay with me for a while.

511
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,875
-Greetings, sir. Welcome.
-Greetings.

512
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,333
-Eat with us.
-Have you told him everything?

513
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,791
-Yes, I've told him.
-Great.

514
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,833
-Say bye to your dad.
-Bye!

515
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,416
-Bye, Dad.
-Stay for a while.

516
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,833
I'll pick you up in the evening.

517
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,958
Meena! Meena!

518
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,666
-Get me the hammer.
-Sir.

519
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,041
My dad is not home.

520
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,500
So what? I'll return it once I'm done.
Bring it.

521
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,083
-Is your dad out?
-Yes.

522
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,416
I'll return it in the evening.
Inform your dad.

523
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,833
-Bye.
-Okay, sir.

524
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:52,000
Dad, Mr. Moopan took your hammer
when you were not home.

525
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:57,250
I gave it to him, but he said
that a bird knocked it into a well.

526
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:58,583
Don't ask me anything.

527
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:02,291
I can't ask him.
You can ask him yourself.

528
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,083
Go on, eat.

529
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,250
That little...

530
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:14,833
Who is it at this hour?

531
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,166
-Where's my hammer?
-Hey.

532
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,041
-Can't you see that I'm sleeping?
-Why should I see that?

533
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,333
I'll buy you a new hammer
in the morning.

534
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,041
I want my hammer back.

535
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,166
Oh, God...

536
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:29,125
How dare you sleep
when I'm talking to you!

537
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,041
Why are you troubling me?

538
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:36,416
Bring it to me!

539
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,416
-Hey, you! Come here!
-Wait!

540
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,166
Stop, don't leave me behind!

541
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,125
Hey!

542
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:46,000
<i>Hear the ice cream horn?</i>
<i>That's Muthukutty</i>

543
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:49,083
<i>What trouble will he cause today?</i>

544
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,250
<i>He is the King in his ice cream castle</i>

545
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,583
<i>And the castle is known</i>
<i>For Muthukutty's shenanigans</i>

546
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:58,708
<i>Hear the ice cream horn?</i>
<i>That's Muthukutty</i>

547
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:01,833
<i>What trouble will he cause today?</i>

548
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
<i>He is the King in his ice cream castle</i>

549
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:08,875
<i>And the castle is known</i>
<i>For Muthukutty's shenanigans</i>

550
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:11,208
<i>He has downed a bottle of liquor</i>

551
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:15,000
<i>And is dancing his night away</i>

552
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:18,041
<i>When the money lenders try to find him</i>

553
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:21,166
<i>He'll lock himself inside the house</i>

554
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:24,666
If a hen enters his house,
you can forget it.

555
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,833
<i>If he sees a foul on his wall</i>

556
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:31,041
<i>It will be boiling in his pot</i>
<i>The next minute</i>

557
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:34,208
<i>If the foul's owner comes looking for it</i>

558
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,000
<i>He'll give them a bowl of broth</i>

559
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:43,375
<i>Look everywhere,</i>
<i>He might be hiding somewhere</i>

560
00:37:43,458 --> 00:37:49,541
<i>He is a menace who wakes people up</i>
<i>With loud fireworks</i>

561
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,958
<i>He is a wastrel</i>

562
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:56,083
<i>He is penniless</i>

563
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:59,500
<i>But he is the best</i>

564
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,666
<i>When it comes to entertainment</i>

565
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,916
<i>Hear the ice cream horn?</i>
<i>That's Muthukutty</i>

566
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,916
<i>What trouble will he cause today?</i>

567
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,083
<i>He is the King in his ice cream castle</i>

568
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,375
<i>And the castle is known</i>
<i>For Muthukutty's shenanigans</i>

00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,500
<i>Hey, you!</i>

575
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,416
<i>Hey, you!</i>

576
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,291
-Who's that?
-Hey!

577
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,208
<i>Hey, you!</i>

578
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,333
<i>Hey, you!</i>

579
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,416
<i>Hey, you!</i>

580
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,791
GOVERNMENT HIGH SCHOOL

581
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,375
I was saying
that you shouldn't spill the beans.

582
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:14,625
-Granny, give me that candy.
-Yes, come.

583
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,416
Give us mangoes for Rs. 2.

584
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,333
Granny, I'll pay for it.

585
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,250
-Pay me first.
-Be careful.

586
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:23,291
-Anything else?
-Count the money.

587
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:26,166
You get what you paid for.

588
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,791
I've added spices to the mangoes.
Don't rub your eyes after eating them.

589
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,500
There's nothing much left.

590
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,083
Tell me what is on your mind.

591
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:39,583
Well, our friend has become rich
suddenly, right?

592
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,500
Why do you say so?

593
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,916
He says so because you bought him
these snacks.

594
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,125
So?

595
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,041
They've banned lottery tickets, right?

596
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,375
There's no point believing in it.

597
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,750
-That's why your dad...
-My dad?

598
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,458
You go to that Mumbai guy's house, right?

599
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:02,916
Why do you think you go?
Arun lives next to them.

600
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,416
He told me that they're looking
to adopt a boy.

601
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:10,500
They've asked your dad saying
they'll pay for your education.

602
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,208
Your dad has said
that he won't give you up

603
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:16,125
but that he can send you
now and then to play or to study.

604
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,958
He has leased you out
so that he can get paid by them.

605
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,916
You'll spend your holidays there.

606
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,625
Bring a week's worth of snacks
when you come this weekend.

607
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:29,708
-Hey, what do you think of me?
-What?

608
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:34,333
If he leases me out,
should I bring you food?

609
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,250
Am I something to be rented out?

610
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:38,416
Didn't I ask you not to tell him?

611
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,375
He doesn't talk to our dad.

612
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:43,291
Hey, I'll break your jaw with this rock!

613
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,250
-Get away!
-You...

614
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:50,125
Go ask your dad!

615
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,750
Why are you asking me?

616
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:57,625
<i>Dad, when I heard that you are no more</i>

617
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:03,958
<i>I could not digest it</i>

618
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:12,708
<i>You kept troubling your own son</i>

619
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:22,583
<i>When you were in your prime</i>

620
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:30,166
<i>You did not worry about me at all</i>

621
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:36,166
<i>The day you took your last breath</i>

622
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:41,041
<i>You put me in so much suffering, Dad...</i>

623
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,083
<i>Here's my cassette</i>

624
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:50,000
<i>They've set up the boombox</i>
<i>Play this for an hour</i>

625
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:56,750
<i>How would people know</i>
<i>That you're singing about him?</i>

626
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:01,291
<i>Record his name in your cassette, granny</i>

627
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:06,333
<i>Give me the cassette,</i>
<i>I'll record his name in it</i>

628
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:11,000
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>
<i>Go and bring the tape-recorder</i>

629
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:13,500
<i>Check if it has batteries</i>

630
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,458
<i>Press the button to record</i>

631
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:21,625
<i>Start singing, granny</i>

632
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:26,083
<i>I can't stop crying when I think about you</i>

633
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:32,333
<i>Hey, Muthukutty...</i>

634
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,708
<i>Hey, Muthukutty...</i>

635
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:42,375
<i>My dear man, you've left us behind</i>

636
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,166
How do we do this?

637
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:48,166
-Hey, Muthukutty!
-<i>My dear man, you've left us all...</i>

638
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,916
-He was a man of honor!
-Yes!

639
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:01,666
He didn't let poverty
change his honorable ways.

640
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:04,791
Muthukutty who lived by honor
and high values

641
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:07,125
is no more with us today.

642
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:08,291
No more with us today.

643
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:11,625
Here's a song dedicated to him
by our folk group.

644
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:13,833
-A song!
-Why did you have to do so much?

645
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:19,250
<i>Nobody can see the soul</i>
<i>Leaving its mortal coil</i>

646
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,333
Go withdraw some money.
The PIN is 2878.

647
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:23,166
You gave Rs. 20,000 for my wedding.

648
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,708
-Let us do this for you.
-Fine.

649
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:27,291
-But take this, come on.
-We have money.

650
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:33,208
-Did you notice the PIN?
-Naachiya's license plate number, right?

651
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:35,333
<i>We can't forget your face...</i>

652
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:36,625
I've called them.

653
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:39,875
<i>Nobody can see the soul</i>

654
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:43,458
<i>Leaving its mortal coil</i>

655
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:46,875
<i>Nobody can see the soul</i>

656
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:50,416
<i>Leaving its mortal coil</i>

657
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,833
<i>Leaving its mortal coil</i>

658
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,500
All right, all right, all right.

659
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:02,166
The beloved son of the former
Secretary of the Panchayat

660
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,041
Mr. Gunasekaran has gifted Rs. 100

661
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,458
as a token of appreciation
to our folk group.

662
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:12,250
Let me thank him on behalf of our group.

663
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,750
<i>Nobody can see the soul</i>

664
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:19,416

OBITUARY
C MUTHUKUTTY

667
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:29,375
Look at them storming in

668
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,291
wearing white over white

669
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,375
like the wild tigers roaming our forests.

670
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:38,416
Let me welcome these gold-clad
and generous men who are approaching us.

671
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:41,416
Move.

672
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:44,500
Greetings, everyone.

673
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,875
The late Muthukutty borrowed
Rs. 10 lakhs from me

674
00:44:48,958 --> 00:44:50,083
in his full consciousness.

675
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:52,875
Here's the promissory note for the same.

676
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,291
-Anyone can verify it.
-Did he tell you anything about it?

677
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:59,416
His immediate relatives
should pay me Rs. 10 lakhs right now.

678
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,125
Or write me a promissory note.

679
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:04,500
If you refuse to do both,
I won't let you cremate the body.

680
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:08,250
-I won't let this funeral proceed further.
-Let me talk to him.

681
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,625
Do you know anything?

682
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,875
You scoundrel! Come here!

683
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:15,583
His dad is dead and is this the time
to collect your debt, you fool?

684
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:18,458
-Granny, go away.
-Don't touch me!

685
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:19,958
Won't you listen to me?

686
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:23,083
How dare you! Will you stop
a funeral for the sake of money?

687
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,125
Then how do I get my money back?

688
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,500
Will you remain quiet
if it was your money?

689
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:29,750
-Don't touch me.
-Shut up!

690
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:31,791
-Hey, go away!
-How dare you!

691
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,833
-Hey, wait.
-Yes, what of it?

692
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:34,958
His son is here, right?

693
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,458
Just a minute.
Wait, stop.

694
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:39,208
Approach us legally through an advocate.

695
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:42,291
Did your father ask an advocate
before taking a loan from me?

696
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:44,666
There is a problem.
Did I say that I won't pay?

697
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,500
Did I say that I won't pay?

698
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,166
I won't let you take the body!

699
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:50,833
-What is this?
-Do what you can.

700
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:53,208
-Hey, put me down!
-Call whoever you want.

701
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,083
I won't let you take the body.

702
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,333
-Don't create a scene.
-How dare you!

703
00:45:57,625 --> 00:46:00,333
-Let me go! He is testing my patience.
-What will you do?

704
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,333
I'll get your money back, come on.

705
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:11,500
-<i>Humans lose their value...</i>
-Hey!

706
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:16,916
<i>I sing out of grief</i>

707
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:19,666
<i>Let them go at each others' throats</i>

708
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,583
<i>The grief is overwhelming</i>

709
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,791
<i>The grief is overwhelming</i>

710
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:28,041
Something seems fishy.
Why would your dad borrow so much money?

711
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:32,791
He must have gotten into something big.
What is it this time?

712
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,416
They find new ways to gamble all the time.

713
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,625
You were so uptight
that you won't take my money.

714
00:46:39,791 --> 00:46:42,250
I'd still leave money
for you on the table, right?

715
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,000
Why didn't you ask me?

716
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,208
-Why did you take such a loan?
-Hey...

717
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:48,958
-Answer me!
-Naachiya was here when you were away.

718
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,541
Why are you telling him that?

719
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,208
Leave it.

720
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:55,333
W-Was Naachiya here?

721
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:57,083
Was Naachiya here?

722
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,125
W-Why didn't you tell me?

723
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,500
I knew that she'd come.

724
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:10,208
Woolflower. This is the garland
she got, right?

725
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,166
That's her favorite.

726
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,458
Did you treat her well?

727
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:17,333
Did Meena speak to her?

728
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:19,375
Did she look for me?

729
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,708
Why wasn't I here then?

730
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,250
Sorry...

731
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:27,791
You're Naachiya's friend.

732
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:29,291
I won't scold you.

733
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:31,666
She rejected me,
but she came to see you.

734
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,000
I won't scold you.

735
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,000
-Thank you.
-Bye.

736
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,666
Women these days are so beautiful.

737
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,333
Back then, there was barely any beauty.

738
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,125
You can't say that for sure.

739
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:57,208
Women were fit working in the fields.
Don't forget that.

740
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,166
Girls are always beautiful.

741
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,416
What is the point in having you
as a kin?

742
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:05,375
-You don't care about me.
-You seem fit and fine.

743
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:07,208
I plan on getting married.

744
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,083
I'm growing old, right?

745
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:13,416
Getting married? Learn to walk without
tripping on your own foot before that.

746
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:15,500
Worry about your youth after that.

747
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,250
Let me talk to him.

748
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:20,541
Sir! Sir!

749
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,625
Don't talk to him.

750
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:26,750
-Senga!
-How are you?

751
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:30,000
-I'm good, how are you?
-Aren't you watching the competition?

752
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:33,250
-Senga.
-Ask your husband to buy you an ice cream.

753
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:34,875
-Come on.
-No, sir.

754
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:36,500
I have a sore throat.

755
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:38,583
You ended marrying an indebted person.

756
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,041
Hey, Moopan!
Where is my hammer?

757
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:42,875
I'll give you the land.
Go and look for it.

758
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:43,791
Buy me some snacks.

759
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:46,000
I've been buying you snacks for 15 years!

760
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:47,625
-Hey!
-Come.

761
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,166
You'll come back, right?

762
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,833
The youth of our town

763
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:53,625
are holding their breath underwater

764
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:57,041
to look for a pebble painted in red.

765
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:59,333
So put it simply

766
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,875
around 20 young men
are swimming in River Amaravathi

767
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:03,916
trying to find the painted pebble

768
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:06,958
hidden by our volunteers.

769
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:11,375
MLA Masanam offers Rs. 2,000
to the winner.

770
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:14,791
The Secretary of the Panchayat, Vellayan

771
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:15,958
offers a bronze cup.

772
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:18,583
The People's Party offers a fold-able cot

773
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:22,500
and Landlord Loganathan offers

774
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,791
a gold coin that weighs 4 grams
to the winner.

775
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,666
Four grams of gold!

776
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:31,625
Guruprasath has surfaced

777
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:35,708
with a bleeding nose,
unable to hold his breath any longer.

778
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:39,041
Volunteer Alwin is helping him
out of the water.

779
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:42,625
Hey, volunteers, come on!
Run to their aid.

780
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:45,708
The volunteers are doing their duty

781
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:49,083
as lifeguards to those who can't breath

782
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:53,750
and as a referee to those who surface
during the game to catch a breath.

783
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,041
Hey, what is this?
Why are you holding a voodoo doll?

784
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:00,916
And that's the cue for Dhanraj

785
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,208
to exit the competition.

786
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,333
Let's wait and see.
We'll soon know who the winner is.

787
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,500
Wow! There! Look!
He comes out of the water like <i>Baahubali</i>!

788
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:15,166
Here comes the winner
holding the painted pebble,

789
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,291
the winner of the gold coin...

790
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,208
-What was his name again?
-It's Parthy.

791
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:22,125
-He was the winner last time too.
-The winner is Parthy!

792
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,666
I just learned that he won the competition
the last two years as well.

793
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:30,958
His friends have already reached him
to celebrate the victory.

794
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:34,833
His parents must be
really proud right now.

795
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:39,000
There's no doubt that this is
a precious moment for them.

796
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:44,625
His gait looks like he'll be the winner
in the upcoming years as well.

797
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,541
Guruprasath is getting first aid now.

798
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:50,875
But there are still others underwater

799
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:55,375
who don't even know
that the competition is over.

800
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:58,250
They will receive consolation prices.

801
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:01,791
Here comes the victor!

802
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:05,375
-He is galloping to the stage.
-Parthy!

803
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:07,916
Congratulations! Superb!

804
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,500
Welcome! Congratulations!

805
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,833
-He always wins.
-Now.

806
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,958
They gift him a shawl.

807
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:19,166
The elder of the town, Mr. Kuppusamy
offers the shawl to the winner.

808
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:22,166
The landlord,
the most generous of them all,

809
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:25,541
is offering the gold coin
to the winner, Parthy.

810
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,583
Parthy!

811
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:32,541
The landlord offers sweets to the victor

812
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:37,083
and makes this moment sweeter
on stage. Congratulations!

813
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:39,750
They make it sound like he has won
the World Cup.

814
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:42,833
Of course, we have to encourage him.
This is a big deal.

815
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:45,375
Your father has already
given him the gold.

816
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,666
Congratulations to the winner!

817
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:51,541
<i>My dear...</i>
Sir, I want a cigar.

818
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:53,666
-Take it.
-I want a cigarette.

819
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,583
-I want one too.
-Take it.

820
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:56,833
What does he want?

821
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:01,041
He is a teetotaler.
Get him some tea.

822
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:03,125
He'll get a fever if he tries to smoke.

823
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,375
Just sit down.

824
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:12,500
You're lighting it the wrong way.
Have you ever seen me doing that?

825
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:16,500
I got emotional, buddy.
See, my eyes are tearing up.

826
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:20,750
I wanted to go to Goa. You struggled
so much to make my wish come true.

827
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,958
Liar! You teared up
because of the smoke.

828
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:26,625
All of us wish to go to Goa.
He didn't do it only for you.

829
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:30,041
You want to go to Goa, right?
Hey, call the pawn shop.

830
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,458
Call them!
They might step out for lunch.

831
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:35,791
All right?
Ask him to keep the money ready.

832
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Then he might waste our time
dilly-dallying. Okay?

833
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:41,750
Let's pawn it and catch the bus tonight.

834
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:44,666
-Tonight?
-Let's do it right away.

835
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,833
Why should we wait?
Call him! How much do four grams cost?

836
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:50,250
-I'm checking.
-Wow! We're going to Goa!

837
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,166
Let me update my status first.

838
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,125
Sir, I'll pay you later.

839
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:56,166
-Don't push me!
-We're coming, Goa!

840
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:01,916
Sir, keep counting.
Let him check it.

841
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,708
Hey, I don't have a good bag.
Shall I pack my clothes in your bag?

842
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:11,333
Hey, we'll carry you on our shoulders
if we have to. Don't worry.

843
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:14,375
I have a huge bag.
Let's use that.

844
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:18,958
There's north Goa
and then there's south Goa.

845
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:21,125
-Where shall we go first?
-North Goa...

846
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:24,208
There's a mountain with a huge sign
that says "Kingfisher".

847
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:28,208
That should be our first destination.
Everything else can wait.

848
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,125
-Hey, wait a minute.
-What is it, sir?

849
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:35,166
-Isn't it 24 carat? Even 20 carats would--
-This is not even gold. It's fake.

850
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,875
The plating is melting. This isn't
worth anything. Take it with you.

851
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:41,791
-We've been fooled.
-What?

852
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:43,375
Keep it inside, sir.
Close it.

853
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:47,958
Sir, which solution did he pour on it?

854
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,291
Which solution was it?

855
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,208
Hey, come on.

856
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:58,666
{\an8}PAWN SHOP

857
00:54:00,291 --> 00:54:01,583
Hey, which bus shall I book?

858
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:03,875
Which one? Tell me quickly.

859
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:07,166
-There are not many seats left.
-Wait.

860
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:08,333
Hey, tell me!

861
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:10,166
Parthy, hey...

862
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:16,791
You tricked us, you fraudster!

863
00:54:16,916 --> 00:54:18,416
-You scoundrel!
-What happened?

864
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,083
At least the cup was real.

865
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:23,833
He fooled us with the gold.

866
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,416
GRAND SWIMMING COMPETITION

867
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,083
You fraudster.

DISTRICT COLLECTORATE

869
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:38,375
-Hey, how long do we have to wait?
-The cameraman will be here in 30 minutes.

870
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,583
He just called.
Be patient, he'll be here.

871
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:43,125
-Who is coming?
-They're from a channel.

872
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,250
Popular.

873
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,875
-Popular.
-Popular TV.

874
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,041
Is that the only one?

875
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:49,666
-Isn't that enough?
-How long do we have to wait?

876
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,208
Hey, hold the buffalo.

877
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:55,500
To help me study...

878
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:58,500
-Are your initials right?
-Yes, they are.

879
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,583
Do you want to come along?

880
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:02,750
No, I'm waiting for Vinu.
You go ahead.

881
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,833
-Oh, Vinu is coming? Okay, bye.
-Yes.

882
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:06,958
-Let's go.
-Bye, dear.

883
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:10,041
Should I hold on to the buffalo
while you booze?

884
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:12,083
-You're the right person for it.
-Hey.

885
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:15,083
How come the writer is so young?

886
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:19,250
Shall we try giving her the petition?

887
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:22,375
Hey, I asked
because she looks so petite.

888
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,958
I've never seen her before.

889
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,291
They pop out of nowhere.

890
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:31,166
Hey, have you also started
changing your attention?

891
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,541
Hey, he is also a teenager.

892
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:35,375
-You're right.
-Hey.

893
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,708
Do you really not know who she is?

894
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:40,625
Who is she?

895
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:43,041
She is the landlord's daughter!

896
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:45,708
-Is that his daughter?
-Yes.

897
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:48,208
It must be four years
since she got her periods.

898
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,708
I think it was around Diwali, 2011.

899
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:53,875
-How do you know so much about that?
-Just like that.

900
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:58,083
His father hung up posters everywhere
to celebrate his daughter's coming of age.

901
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:00,458
That was the first time
we saw so many posters.

902
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:03,000
She is covered in gold from head to toe.

903
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,750
Her pendant looks so enchanting.

904
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:10,000
-But he ended up tricking us.
-Let's fight for justice then.

905
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:13,833
-Let this be a lesson to her.
-Yes, let's go and reform them.

906
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,333
A crime is a crime,
no matter who commits it.

907
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,708
What's up with them?
Let's do what we came here for.

908
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:22,916
Come on, hey...

909
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:28,583
{\an8}RATHINA SABAPATHY
WRITER

910
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,250
We want to write a petition.

911
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:39,291
I'm not the writer,
I came here to help a friend.

912
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:40,791
You can help us too.

913
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:42,750
Yes, do it.

914
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:49,375
You played well the other day.

915
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:52,000
I meant the swimming competition.

916
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,250
I played?

917
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:56,208
-Right.
-What's your name?

918
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:57,916
Parthy.

919
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,166
Write it neatly, okay?

920
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,291
-Address?
-RS Polytechnic College, Idayapatti.

921
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,083
-What's her name?
-Naachiya.

922
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:08,333
I think it's Naachiya.

923
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:12,083
My dear... Honorable...

924
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:13,791
No, write "honorable".

925
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:16,208
-Honorable...
-Just tell me the issue.

926
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:17,750
-I'll write it.
-Is that so?

927
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:20,250
To... Write whatever your name is.

928
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:23,083
When I staked my life

929
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,083
and held my breath underwater

930
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,916
to find the painted pebble
and emerge as a winner

931
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:32,791
the landlord, your father,
fed me sweets

932
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:36,125
and pretended to give me a gold coin
all the while being applauded,

933
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:40,250
when in reality, it was a fake coin.

934
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:43,250
So we humbly declare
that we will take back

935
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:46,916
what is rightfully ours from you,
his daughter.

936
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:49,125
-Thank you. Write this down.
-Thank you.

937
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:51,458
Go on, write.

938
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:55,500
-Hey...
-Hey, catch her!

939
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:57,083
-Stop. Don't ask.
-Who are they?

940
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:59,000
I'll tell you, just go!

941
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:01,666
-Hey!
-Pal, she took to her heels!

942
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:04,583
We should've actually robbed her
of her jewels.

943
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:07,541
-An umbrella.
-An umbrella.

944
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:10,291
-A lotus.
-<i>Greetings!</i>

945
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:12,833
Aunt, look, it's Pluto the dog.

946
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:14,708
-Pluto the dog.
-<i>...college students</i>

947
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:19,166

<i>in front of the Collector's office.</i>

948
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:24,541
<i>They've been giving petitions to</i>
<i>the Collector asking to build a bus stop</i>

949
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:27,958
-<i>and a speed break near their college...</i>
-Look at their audacity!

950
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:32,458
-<i>Since their petitions were not heeded...</i>
-Do you think the Collector saw it?

951
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:36,708
<i>they took such drastic</i>
<i>yet comedic measures.</i>

952
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:42,541
-That's a buffalo.

SHRI ANNAMALAYAR DRIVING SCHOOL

954
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,000
Sir, do you have a coil motor?

955
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:50,875
-Just a minute, Aunt.
-A coil motor?

956
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,416
I have this one only.

957
00:58:58,291 --> 00:58:59,166
Oh, God...

958
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:05,875
Look here, Parthy,
someone's raining on your cycle.

959
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:07,750
-Aunt! Come here!
-Hey!

960
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:09,625
Who are you? Who is your aunt?

961
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,166
-Aunt!
-Hey, twist his ears.

962
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,083
-Twist his ears.
-He's just a kid.

963
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,916
-Oh, no!
-Hey!

964
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:18,416
-You're still peeing!
-Aunt!

965
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:20,875
-How dare you! Call your aunt.
-I can't stop!

966
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:23,375
-Come here, Aunt.
-Call her.

967
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:25,208
Come quickly, Aunt.

968
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:27,708
-Come here, Aunt.
-How dare you pee on my cycle!

969
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:29,375
-Come here, Aunt!
-Gandhi!

970
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:32,208
Hey, Gandhi! Gandhi!

971
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:34,416
-Gandhi--
-Gandhi!

972
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:36,541
Hey, Gandhi!

973
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:39,666
Gandhi!

974
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,333
Come here.
Don't try to run away.

975
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:46,500
Come here.
You ran away the other day too.

976
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,833
Now, you make your nephew pee on my cycle.

977
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:51,625
Haven't I warned you
against peeing on others' cycles?

978
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:55,083
-Isn't he the buffalo man we saw on TV?
-You little...

979
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:58,833
I'll twist your limbs now.
You'll have trouble peeing after that.

980
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:01,791
Come on, he is just a kid.
What do you want now?

981
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,625
Wipe it.

982
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,250
It stinks.

983
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:28,208
-Crap.
-It's okay.

984
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,708
I didn't apologize.
You've stepped on crap.

985
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:35,958
Hey.

986
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:38,958
Come on.

987
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:42,833
These are my mom's old jewels.
They're not mine.

988
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:58,750
How's that?

989
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:08,833
You look for it.
I'll go and buy a cage.

990
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,000
Come back soon.
I'll start searching.

991
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,958
Hey, birdie, where are you?

992
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,166
Hey...

993
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,708
Who dropped you here?

994
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,833
Let's sit in the shade.

995
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,666
Are you scared?

996
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,625
-Where are you going?
-Naachiya.

997
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,083
Naachiya.

998
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,250
What are you doing here alone?

999
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,208
I've to place this bird in a cage.

1000
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,500
My friends have gone to buy one.

1001
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:08,041
-Are you going to put it in a cage?
-Yes.

1002
01:02:08,416 --> 01:02:12,333
I saw it yesterday and felt bad
that I couldn't help it.

1003
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:15,916
I had nightmares
that it was eaten by a vulture.

1004
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,583
Naachiya, it has wings.

1005
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:20,083
It's learning to fly.

1006
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:23,416
Like how we learn to walk or cycle,
it's learning to fly.

1007
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:28,250
Look, its parents are watching
from over there.

1008
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:33,958
Come on.

1009
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:38,833
Its mother might abandon it
if it smells of a human.

1010
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:41,083
Oh, is there such a thing?

1011
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:44,375
Yes. We can help it if it had fallen
off the nest without wings.

1012
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:46,500
So it's learning to fly?

1013
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,958
-Will it fly?
-It will.

1014
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:05,208
Where do you have to go?
Tell me, I'll drop you.

1015
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,041
-No, my friends will come.
-When will they?

1016
01:03:08,166 --> 01:03:11,375
You're not buying the cage, right?
I'll drop you where they are.

1017
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,125
I don't want to get in your car.

1018
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:18,041
I'm doing this out of concern.
If I leave, you'll stand here all alone.

1019
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:23,083
Hey, I'm from this town too. I'm sure
someone I know will pass by shortly.

1020
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,333
-Just you wait.
-Okay.

1021
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:44,791
Isn't he the plumber I know?
He's not looking back.

1022
01:03:47,916 --> 01:03:50,166
-Someone will come.
-Let's see.

1023
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:56,500
I guess people are sleeping
after eating their fill.

1024
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:05,250
<i>Hey, you...</i>

1025
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:09,833
Uncle! Mr. Ice Cream Man!

1026
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:12,583
Didn't I tell you?

1027
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:15,875
-Uncle!
-Naachiya, dear.

1028
01:04:18,416 --> 01:04:19,291
Uncle!

1029
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:22,208
-I didn't bring ice cream today.
-That's okay.

1030
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,750
Why are you here?
There are wastrels around.

1031
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,708
Yes, let's leave right away.

1032
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:30,750
Wait, let me push you.
Come on!

1033
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:36,083
-Hop on.
-Go slowly.

1034
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,000
Shall we go?

1035
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:46,875
<i>Hey, you...</i>

1036
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:50,916
Who is he honking at?

1037
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:53,875
See how he looks at us.

1038
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:58,416
-What an attitude!
-That's true. He's my son, after all.

1039
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:00,750
-Your...
-He is a pepper-upper.

1040
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,708
Let me do it, Aunt.

1041
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,791
Here, this is tea with pepper.
Drink it.

1042
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,833
-What did you say?
-It's tea with pepper.

1043
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:19,000
Drink it.

1044
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:31,416
Hello? Your cousin goes
to RS College, right?

1045
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,875
-<i>Yes.</i>
-I need a help.

1046
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:39,250
There's a student named Parthy.
He works part time as a driving coach.

1047
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:41,750
-He is the ice cream man's son.
-<i>Who is that?</i>

1048
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:44,416
His father sells ice cream.

1049
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:48,125
He even staged a demonstration by giving
a petition to a buffalo.

1050
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:50,708
-He was on TV too!
-<i>What do you want now?</i>

1051
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:53,833
-I want his number.
-<i>I'll get it for you.</i>

1052
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,333
-Oh, God...
-Yes!

1053
01:05:58,166 --> 01:05:59,416
Look at her glee.

1054
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:09,500
Naachiya.

1055
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:13,916
Don't be scared.
There's no one around.

1056
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:29,875
-Did you ask for my number?
-Yes.

1057
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:34,083
We don't have a phone at home.
Why did you want my number?

1058
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,458
I wanted to return something to you.

1059
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:40,041
No, it's okay.
I don't want it.

1060
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,416
I knew that Mr. Muthukutty
has a son, but I didn't know...

1061
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:48,208
I've sent you ice cream in hollow balls.

1062
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:51,583
-Was that yours?
-Yes.

1063
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,125
He'd eat all the ice cream
and give me the ball.

1064
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:58,833
He is such a kid.

1065
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:04,375
He felt bad that you haven't spoken to him
properly in years.

1066
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:06,291
Why aren't you talking to him?

1067
01:07:07,666 --> 01:07:11,625
There's no specific reason. Two swords
cannot fit into the same sheath, right?

1068
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,041
It's like that. If he is home,
I won't be there and vice versa.

1069
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:17,916
How come?
Don't you get along with each other?

1070
01:07:18,916 --> 01:07:21,708
If money lenders come asking for him,
I wouldn't rat him out.

1071
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:23,541
He'd do the same for me.

1072
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:28,041
Whatever. I don't understand
what's going on between you two.

1073
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:31,250
I've played behind your house
in childhood.

1074
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,750
Your house used to be
a landmark back then.

1075
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:38,208
I found an empty soap packet
behind your house.

1076
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,583
I brought it home
and kept it on the shelf.

1077
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:44,083
The whole house turned fragrant.

1078
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:50,583
I have a blocked nose now.
Do you still use the same soap?

1079
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,666
She is from a rich background.
I don't want to pursue this.

1080
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,875
But I have confidence that I'll become
successful one day.

1081
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,250
-What do I do?
-Bury that confidence.

1082
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,875
Just do your job.

1083
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:28,416
Okay.

1084
01:08:30,333 --> 01:08:32,666
You pay your college fees
by working part time.

1085
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:36,541
I'm proud of you for saving up
and getting your sister married.

1086
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:40,416
Don't become ordinary like us
by getting into this.

1087
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:07,666
You were underwater and yet you
made me fall for you. - Naachiya Parthy

1088
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:35,291
<i>You gave life to my soul, my love!</i>

1089
01:10:35,666 --> 01:10:41,750
<i>Let's arrange a feast</i>
<i>And get married in a grand ceremony</i>

1090
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:47,958
<i>We are bound together like the two sides</i>
<i>Of the same coin, my dear</i>

1091
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:54,333
<i>All I want is to spend</i>
<i>The rest of my life with you by my side</i>

1092
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:27,166
<i>Even when the sun is scorching,</i>
<i>I feel cool as a cucumber</i>

1093
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:33,791
<i>When she is by my side</i>

1094
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:40,291
<i>Her smile makes me feel</i>
<i>Like a twilight muzzle</i>

1095
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:46,625
<i>That is all I need in life, my love!</i>

1096
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:52,833
<i>I used to feel useless before</i>

1097
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:59,416
<i>But you proved me wrong</i>
<i>With all your love</i>

1098
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:02,916
<i>I wish to be there for you</i>

1099
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,625
<i>This is the dream I have for us</i>

1100
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:11,583
<i>You gave life to my soul, my love!</i>

1101
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:17,625
<i>Let's arrange a feast</i>
<i>And get married in a grand ceremony</i>

1102
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:24,041
<i>We are bound together like the two sides</i>
<i>Of the same coin, my dear</i>

1103
01:12:24,416 --> 01:12:26,750
<i>All I want is to spend</i>
<i>The rest of my life...</i>

1104
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,916
I have become ordinary too.

1105
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:37,416
PARTHY

1106
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:08,666
<i>Our lives are entwined like grape vines</i>

1107
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:13,625
<i>How thrilled am I to write</i>
<i>Your name alongside mine</i>

1108
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:16,083
-Uncle Parthy?
-Don't tell anyone.

1109
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:21,583
<i>My chest flutters Like a sparrow's wings</i>

1110
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:28,083
<i>When I think about you,</i>
<i>Something brightens up inside me</i>

1111
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:07,666
Target found.

1112
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,625
Muthukutty!

1113
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,333
Muthukutty!

1114
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:27,291
My dear!

1115
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:36,791
This hammer belonged to your dad.

1116
01:14:37,375 --> 01:14:39,416
We've dug up the well
many times before.

1117
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:45,041
After all these years,
we found it today.

1118
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,833
Bury this along with him.
His soul will rest in peace.

1119
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,500
<i>Your soul has departed the body</i>

1120
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:56,583
<i>The entire family is filled with sorrow</i>

1121
01:14:56,666 --> 01:15:01,083
<i>As they mourn your death</i>

1122
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:04,000
<i>As they mourn your death</i>

1123
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,250
Rs.35,000?

1124
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:08,375
Why did you spend so much for the bier?

1125
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:10,833
It will be paid by your sister.
Don't worry.

1126
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:13,166
-Show me the bill.
-Is that Yama, the God of Death?

1127
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:17,958
Hey, I'm not ready to leave.
Go away from here.

1128
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:20,000
I have a lot of duties.

1129
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:23,458
I should get my grandchildren married.
I will come after two months.

1130
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:25,208
Go away from here.

1131
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:26,583
Hey, Selvi.

1132
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:29,000
-Come. I brought food.
-Go away.

1133
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:30,416
-Come soon.
-Go away.

1134
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,250
I'm starving.
Come soon.

1135
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:35,791
<i>...Muthukutty!</i>

1136
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:42,500
<i>My beloved Muthukutty</i>
<i>He has left me and moved on</i>

1137
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:47,000
<i>My beloved Muthukutty</i>
<i>He has left me and moved on</i>

1138
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:49,250
<i>In this yellow city</i>

1139
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:53,083
<i>On the roads where cars pass by,</i>
<i>My eyes are filled with tears</i>

1140
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:55,500
WARNING
THERE IS A HOLE DUG OUT HERE

1141
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,833
<i>My beloved Muthukutty!</i>

1142
01:15:58,916 --> 01:16:04,875
<i>My beloved Muthukutty has left me alone</i>
<i>He has left me and moved on</i>

1143
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:08,625
My son would never bath in cold water.

1144
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:10,791
Take this hot water.

1145
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:13,416
-He won't shave his head.
-Okay.

1146
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,166
-What about the hand?
-Yes, shave a bit from his hand.

1147
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:19,166
Who is playing wedding songs
near a funeral?

1148
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,875
Whoever it is, stop it
until the body is taken away.

1149
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:23,500
Is that Murugan Sound Service?

1150
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:27,250
It's a grand wedding.
They must've hired someone from the town.

1151
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,875
Whose wedding?

1152
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:31,708
Landlord Loganathan's
youngest daughter is getting married.

1153
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:33,375
Loganathan's daughter?

1154
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:34,583
Who is the groom?

1155
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:38,333
He is from Keeranur,
the heir to Suryaprabha Mills.

1156
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:42,583
Oh, God! The kid is heartbroken.

1157
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:48,541
My grandson is heartbroken.
Muthukutty was hale and hearty.

1158
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:52,375
He should've lived for a few more years.
His death is so unfair!

1159
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:55,666
Don't cry, my precious.
It hurts to see you cry.

1160
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:08,916
-What's wrong, Parthy?
-What is it?

1161
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:12,083
-Why didn't you tell me about her wedding?
-What's the point?

1162
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:14,833
What would you have done?
You broke up, right?

1163
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:17,625
You left to forget her!
I didn't want to remind you...

1164
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:20,833
Do you know that we broke up?
What do you know?

1165
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:24,583
Everyone is betraying me.

1166
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:27,250
Ask the son to come.
He needs to perform some rituals.

1167
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:29,000
-What the hell!
-Forget about it.

1168
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:30,583
Just stay calm for a while.

1169
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:33,583
You need to perform a few rituals.
They need you there.

1170
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:36,333
It's only the engagement.
The wedding is in two days.

1171
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:38,916
So we have time.
First, let's finish this.

1172
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,125
-Then let's decide what to do.
-We'll help you complete the rituals soon.

1173
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:46,250
-Okay? Everything will be fine.
-Right! Come.

1174
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,375
Sir! Hold on a minute.

1175
01:18:26,583 --> 01:18:29,083
We can't bury the body today.
His relatives are on the way.

1176
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:32,500
-If we bury the body, it'll be a problem.
-What are you saying?

1177
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:36,625
-Why didn't you tell this earlier?
-Please understand our situation.

1178
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:38,750
We can cremate him as soon as they come.

1179
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:41,416
The flowers on the bier
are starting to wither.

1180
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,083
Do as you wish!

1181
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:45,041
-Come back tomorrow.
-Leave now!

1182
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:46,500
Ladies can start singing.

1183
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:48,458
We'll bury the body tomorrow.

1184
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,500
-Is that all?
-I'll explain later!

1185
01:18:51,666 --> 01:18:56,041
<i>-Our beloved Muthukutty has left us...</i>
-Go on. Join them.

1186
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:57,291
Let's go.

1187
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:04,291
<i>-Oh, dear Lord</i>
<i>-Oh, dear Lord</i>

1188
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:07,708
<i>-Oh, dear Lord</i>
<i>-Oh, dear Lord</i>

1189
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:13,166
<i>We have lost our dear man</i>

1190
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,250
<i>We have lost him</i>

1191
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:16,833
-Parthy!
-Parthy!

1192
01:19:18,791 --> 01:19:21,208
-What's wrong?
-You father's body is gone!

1193
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:23,916
-What are you saying?
-I don't understand.

1194
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,875
We were preparing the bier.

1195
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:29,916
When we went inside to bathe him,
the body was gone.

1196
01:19:30,875 --> 01:19:32,458
I don't know what to do.

1197
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:49,083
-Stop the car for a minute.
-Stop it.

1198
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:50,833
-Why?
-Stop the car.

1199
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:53,833
-What? Where are you going?
-We'll be back.

1200
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,833
They must have planned something.

1201
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:06,541
Let's use this to keep the beer chilled.

1202
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:08,166
You're always clever when it comes

1203
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,875
-to partying!
-Hey, awesome!

1204
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:15,625
<i>-Ask them to follow them everywhere.</i>
<i>-Okay, sir!</i>

1205
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,000
<i>I snatched it from him.</i>

1206
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:28,250
<i>-How is this?</i>
<i>-I can't make them understand.</i>

1207
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:32,291
<i>Make this moron understand that we'll</i>
<i>miss the train if we don't leave now.</i>

1208
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,250
<i>Hey, come on!</i>

1209
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:47,166
<i>Let me search inside.</i>
<i>What a creation!</i>

1210
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:02,625
-Sister, control yourself.
-How can I?

1211
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:05,250
We didn't look after him
when he was alive.

1212
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:07,625
We failed to protect him
even after he died.

1213
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:11,416
-This is a sin!
-Say it to everyone then!

1214
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:14,333
-Let everyone know.
-What will happen if they find out?

1215
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:18,416
Stay calm. The back door is open.
Some animal must've dragged his body.

1216
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:21,708
If the villagers find out, they'll
gossip for the rest of our lives.

1217
01:21:21,791 --> 01:21:24,791
-What are we going to do?
-Make sure the movie plays continuously.

1218
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:27,666
Keep the water pot outside.
Nobody should enter the house.

1219
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:30,958
We should find it before dawn.
Keep the liquor flowing.

1220
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:34,333
If they get sober,
all hell will break loose.

1221
01:21:34,416 --> 01:21:37,125
Sister, take care.
Let's go. Take the torch.

1222
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:40,208
-Call us if you need anything.
-The torch must be on the slab.

1223
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:41,666
-Got it?
-Here it is!

1224
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,166
-You got it?
-Hey!

1225
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:46,083
Why are you sitting here?
Get up. Let's go.

1226
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:00,458
Hey, check over there.

1227
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,083
No, no! Don't!

1228
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:03,958
Heck. Two creatures are making out.

1229
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:05,791
Look at the place they've chosen.

1230
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:15,166
Selvam, point the light in that direction.

1231
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,416
-He hit a pig!
-Who was it?

1232
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:24,458
-Is that a pig?
-Whose car is that?

1233
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:26,333
-It came out of nowhere.
-Check it out!

1234
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:30,708
-It's the landlord.
-It's him. He's got a new car!

1235
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:34,041
Damn! You filth!
Don't you have any other means to die?

1236
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,208
Why are we watching this? Let's go.

1237
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:38,750
-The car is brand new!
-Let's watch it.

1238
01:22:38,833 --> 01:22:40,541
How do I use this car again?

1239
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,541
The wedding is near.
Where will I buy a new one?

1240
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,083
Who can I even sell this to?

1241
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:51,083
Oh, my God! Heck!
I shouldn't have gone to the meeting.

1242
01:22:51,208 --> 01:22:55,000
-Looks like he will break the bonnet.
-Let's leave.

1243
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:57,125
-It's my fault!
-Sir, please look at this.

1244
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:59,333
-This will calm you down.
-Just go away.

1245
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:03,625
Things have taken a turn for the worse
ever since the wedding was fixed.

1246
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:05,875
It's a bad omen!

1247
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:09,125
We'll have to look at a corpse
in order to make things right.

1248
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:12,916
Let's make a quick stop
if there's a funeral in town.

1249
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,708
-An ice cream vendor died recently.
-Ice cream vendor?

1250
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:18,500
Please wait in the car
for ten minutes.

1251
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:19,750
I will get another car.

1252
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:22,541
-Where is it?
-Near Kannadiputhur Main Road.

1253
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:24,708
-Fine, I'll walk.
-Okay.

1254
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:28,333
The garland that they presented
at the meeting is in the back. Get it.

1255
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:29,375
Yes, sir.

1256
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:33,375
-He's so shameless!
-Scoundrel!

1257
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:35,750
-He's going to our house.
-We should reach before him.

1258
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:38,541
Did my dad die to fix his bad luck?

1259
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:41,500
-We should reach before him, move.
-Let's take the shortcut.

1260
01:23:49,916 --> 01:23:51,666
Look at the scoundrel!

1261
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:54,125
Welcome, sir!

1262
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:58,166
-Welcome.
-I've come to pay my respects.

1263
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:01,208
I don't believe in caste or religion.

1264
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:03,583
I give equal respect to everyone.

1265
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:06,458
-I take part in everyone's joy and sorrow.
-Oh, wow!

1266
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,416
You're a reputable man.

1267
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:11,291
-You have come to my house.
-Oh, that's okay.

1268
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:14,333
Don't expect that I would say such things.

1269
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:16,208
I won't show you the corpse.

1270
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,583
-He didn't die to fix your bad luck.
-Hey...

1271
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:20,541
-Haw dare you talk that way!
-What of it?

1272
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:22,291
Do you know what gold is?

1273
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:27,708
You fooled me once.
Your daughter has a heart of gold.

1274
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,916
I'm not up to her standards.
That's why I walked away.

1275
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:33,833
-We were in love.
-What!

1276
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:35,333
Did you ask what she wanted?

1277
01:24:35,541 --> 01:24:37,750
If you act arrogant, this is what you get.

1278
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:40,625
You decided to get her
married to that imbecile, right?

1279
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,375
Your bad luck will follow you.

1280
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:44,375
Misfortune will follow you.

1281
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:46,625
How dare you say such things!

1282
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,625
-You will suffer!
-Come quickly.

1283
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:54,583
<i>-He has left us all!</i>
-Come, join the singing.

1284
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:57,500
<i>He has left us all!</i>

1285
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:00,625
<i>-He has left us all!</i>
-Come, let's join.

1286
01:25:00,708 --> 01:25:06,291
<i>He has left us all!</i>
<i>He has left us all!</i>

1287
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:08,375
<i>He has left us all!</i>

1288
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:09,500
Let go of me!

1289
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:13,000
Don't come near me!
I'll break your bones if you do.

1290
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:17,541
<i>He has left us all!</i>

1291
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:28,708
-Hello.
-<i>Parthy.</i>

1292
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:31,791
<i>The VAO and insurance checking</i>
<i>inspector are on their way.</i>

1293
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:34,833
<i>They informed me just now.</i>
<i>So I called to tell you.</i>

1294
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:36,166
<i>I'll ask them to come.</i>

1295
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:38,791
-Okay, ask them to come.
-<i>All right.</i>

1296
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:45,666
-Hey, what's wrong?
-Who called?

1297
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:48,166
The VAO and checking inspector
are coming here.

1298
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,125
What?

1299
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:50,708
-We're done!
-What are you saying?

1300
01:25:50,791 --> 01:25:53,250
We'll have to tell them the truth.

1301
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:55,666
-What are you saying?
-What else can we do now?

1302
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:01,708
They are waiting for people
to come from other places.

1303
01:26:02,958 --> 01:26:05,416
Parthy, look at him.

1304
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:07,625
Hello, can you hear me?

1305
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:12,583
I think he is a contractor.
He looks like your father, right?

1306
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:14,208
I don't have reception here.

1307
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:28,125
-I saw him earlier. But...
-I'll talk to him.

1308
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:30,416
Do you want to reveal
the truth to a stranger?

1309
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:33,333
He knows that the body is gone.
He was there amidst the chaos.

1310
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:36,750
-Yet, he's quiet. I'll talk to him.
- Go on.

1311
01:26:36,833 --> 01:26:40,666
-I'll convince him.
-The west coast train arrives at 5 a.m.

1312
01:26:43,708 --> 01:26:44,708
Can you hear me?

1313
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:46,333
Sir!

1314
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:49,500
-Please come with us.
-Why?

1315
01:26:49,791 --> 01:26:53,083
-Please come with us. I'll tell you.
-Why should I?

1316
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:57,458
-Come quickly.
-What are you doing?

1317
01:26:57,583 --> 01:26:59,166
The officers will be here soon.

1318
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:00,666
-Officer?
-Give it to him.

1319
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,125
-You give it.
-Please sit.

1320
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:05,166
Why should I do it?

1321
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:07,708
Please lie down for a while.
Please, sir.

1322
01:27:07,791 --> 01:27:09,291
What are you saying?

1323
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,583
Yes. Lie down for a while, please.

1324
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:15,541
-What are you hiding?
-I'll explain everything in a while.

1325
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:17,958
-Just lie down.
-You should explain.

1326
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:20,000
-I will. Lie down.
-Lift your leg.

1327
01:27:20,208 --> 01:27:23,083
-Cover him.
-Hold on. Let him lie down.

1328
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,125
The coin shouldn't drop.
Use the sandal paste.

1329
01:27:29,416 --> 01:27:30,708
Please close your eyes.

1330
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:37,166
<i>Look here, have you seen him anywhere?</i>

1331
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:40,916
-Are you his son?
-Yes, sir.

1332
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,083
-When did he pass away?
-Last night, sir.

1333
01:27:43,416 --> 01:27:47,000
<i>It will be difficult, but don't worry.</i>
<i>They can't find us.</i>

1334
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:48,750
-Let's discuss in the morning.
-Okay.

1335
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:50,333
Okay. We'll take your leave.

1336
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:56,291
-Get up...
-Hold on!

1337
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:58,416
Leave the footwear.

1338
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:03,000
-Hey, who is this?
-They are Parthy's colleagues.

1339
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:06,166
Sorry for the delay.
The car broke down on the way.

1340
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:08,708
I thought you would've cremated him.

1341
01:28:08,791 --> 01:28:13,791
Thankfully, I got a chance
to look at his face one last time.

1342
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:16,708
Sorry, Parthy.

1343
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:18,833
-Hey!
-My God!

1344
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:24,208
I can't act dead for these people. You
asked me to lie down for a while. Idiots!

1345
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:30,166
Hey! What is going on here?

1346
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,041
I will explain later.
Your car keys.

1347
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,208
-Car keys?
-I will explain later.

1348
01:29:10,750 --> 01:29:12,250
Get down.
Hit him, Parthy.

1349
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:14,625
Hit him.
Don't spare him.

1350
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,541
Where's my father?
Where is he?

1351
01:29:19,375 --> 01:29:21,958
-Tell me, where is my father?
-Don't spare him!

1352
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:27,291
Tell me, open your mouth.
Where is my father?

1353
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:30,291
Even if I kill you here,
there won't be a case

1354
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:33,333
anytime soon, as this place
isn't under any jurisdiction.

1355
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,791
I'll drown you right here.

1356
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:40,833
-Tell me! Where is my father?
-What would I do with the body?

1357
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:43,666
Wouldn't I have demanded
money if I had taken it?

1358
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:45,541
-I swear!
-Tell the truth!

1359
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:46,791
Please believe me!

1360
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:48,958
My brother and I
wanted your word.

1361
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,250
-So we put up a drama.
-Drama?

1362
01:29:51,333 --> 01:29:55,166
-How dare you!
-He borrowed money! That's all I know.

1363
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,708
Run away. Otherwise, I'll kill you!

1364
01:30:06,416 --> 01:30:09,833
-Hey Parthy...
-Parthy, what happened? Stop!

1365
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:17,666
{\an8}AELAY ICE CREAM

1366
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:20,250
Who's breaking the bottles!

1367
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,375
Look at him!

1368
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:29,666
My father's ice cream box.
How dare you take it!

1369
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:33,291
Disgusting pieces of shit!
It's my father's ice cream box!

1370
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:34,750
Hey, Parthy!

1371
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:38,166
How dare you!
I'll kill you!

1372
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:39,333
Finish him!

1373
01:30:39,416 --> 01:30:41,333
-Hey, hit him.
-Come here!

1374
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:44,041
Beat him up!
Hit him!

1375
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:45,708
Get lost!

1376
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,916
-Beat him up!
-Parthy!

1377
01:30:49,166 --> 01:30:52,416
-How dare you!
-Where is my father? Tell me.

1378
01:30:53,291 --> 01:30:55,041
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

1379
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,208
-Sir, be careful.
-You're here!

1380
01:30:58,083 --> 01:31:01,541
I knew that you'll try
to spoil everything.

1381
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:04,666
That's why I came here
to pick up the groom.

1382
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:09,750
Did he speak ill of you? Did he ask
for my daughter and create a ruckus?

1383
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:13,125
Your daughter?
Why would he create a ruckus over her?

1384
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:17,791
Enlighten him.
I didn't come here for your daughter.

1385
01:31:21,166 --> 01:31:23,208
My father used to sell
ice cream with this.

1386
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:27,125
They stole it and used it to party
with some strangers. Should I keep quiet?

1387
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:30,541
-She was my classmate.
-Be happy that I didn't break his skull!

1388
01:31:30,791 --> 01:31:32,416
I don't want your daughter.

1389
01:31:32,958 --> 01:31:36,291
I don't want your daughter!
Get her married to this piece of shit.

1390
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:38,125
As if she is the only girl here.

1391
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:44,875
-They're my relatives.
-Just come.

1392
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:47,666
-What's this?
-Don't break the bottle.

1393
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:49,708
-You swore on me!
-That costs Rs. 90.

1394
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:53,500
How dare you flirt with other women
when I'm right here!

1395
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:56,458
-Who'll look after you when you grow old?
-Don't hit me!

1396
01:31:56,541 --> 01:31:59,541
-How dare you go sniffing for a new taste!
-Let's hide.

1397
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:02,375
Come along.
Don't be afraid of them.

1398
01:32:03,208 --> 01:32:05,000
What will you do
if I hit you like this?

1399
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:09,041
-You're a good girl.
-Is that what you think?

1400
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:10,583
I'll show you.

1401
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:15,458
Hey! See, I will hit you badly.

1402
01:32:15,541 --> 01:32:17,000
Hey, it hurts!

1403
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,291
They're gone.

1404
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:23,333
-Idiot!
-Does it hurt?

1405
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:31,208
Hey, Naachiya.
It says that you'll be enemies.

1406
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:34,875
Why are you doing this? They already
treat us like kids in this college.

1407
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:37,708
-And you're acting no different.
-Oh, is it?

1408
01:32:37,791 --> 01:32:40,166
-What's your family deity?
-Alagunachi Amman.

1409
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:42,625
-His family deity?
-Arungarai Amman.

1410
01:32:42,833 --> 01:32:46,791
I knew it!
Both your family deities are enemies.

1411
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:48,416
This is in our blood.

1412
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:53,083
-You both will never be together.
-I'm going to break your skull open!

1413
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:56,791
-I'm doing you a favor.
-Let me do a favor!

1414
01:32:56,875 --> 01:32:59,875
Wait and see!
You'll be separated by a twist of fate.

1415
01:32:59,958 --> 01:33:02,000
-I'll kill you!
-Oh, no!

1416
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,583
-Aunt, surprise!
-Dear, check what it is.

1417
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,750
Wow! An iPhone?

1418
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:13,291
Thanks, Dad.

1419
01:33:27,541 --> 01:33:28,958
Okay, I'm going to the shop.

1420
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:35,125
Parthy, are you going
to see your girlfriend?

1421
01:33:35,375 --> 01:33:37,041
She looked gorgeous in her blue attire.

1422
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:39,916
I saw her photo on Facebook.
Anything special today?

1423
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:46,916
<i>Your fate is twisted now</i>
<i>And you're getting confused</i>

1424
01:33:47,083 --> 01:33:48,833
-Hey, Parthy.
-Hey!

1425
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:51,791
Are you taking her to a temple?

1426
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:54,708
Her photo on Facebook looked graceful.
Carry on.

1427
01:33:54,791 --> 01:34:00,458
<i>Your fate is twisted now</i>
<i>And you're being tousled</i>

1428
01:34:09,458 --> 01:34:10,750
How's my attire?

1429
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:21,625
Ma'am, your attire looks superb!
Mine was the fiftieth like!

1430
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:31,208
<i>Your fate is twisted now</i>
<i>And you're about to get beaten</i>

1431
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:37,208
Do you want to come to the union
to discuss the association issues?

1432
01:34:37,541 --> 01:34:39,875
No. I'm not feeling good.
Let me go home.

1433
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:41,458
What happened?
Any issues?

1434
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:42,708
Wait!

1435
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:47,250
Naachiya had put up a status saying
'Feeling confused'. Is there a problem?

1436
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:49,375
There'll be issues in the beginning.

1437
01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:51,791
-You should adjust...
-Mind your own business.

1438
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:55,125
<i>You're getting dragged around...</i>

1439
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:12,166
Dude, her dress is torn.

1440
01:35:18,416 --> 01:35:19,500
Bring it on!

1441
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:36,750
SHRI ANNAMALAYAR DRIVING SCHOOL

1442
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:01,708
Our performance will be coming up next.

1443
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:10,250
What is this, dear?
Why is your face blurred?

1444
01:36:10,666 --> 01:36:13,791
Everyone else looks clear.
Why are you blurred out?

1445
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:20,083
My aunt is possessed!

1446
01:36:20,166 --> 01:36:23,500
-Don't say that, dear!
-She is not visible on TV.

1447
01:36:23,583 --> 01:36:25,125
My aunt is possessed!

1448
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:27,416
-She looks like a ghost.
-Be quiet!

1449
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:31,375
-She is possessed!
-Kavin, come to me.

1450
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:34,541
-Come to me.
-Ask her to go away.

1451
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:36,791
There's nothing like that. Look at me.

1452
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:40,791
Ask her to go away, she is possessed!

1453
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:42,500
She is possessed!

1454
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:47,458
<i>Hello, Popular TV.</i>

1455
01:36:47,541 --> 01:36:51,250
-Hello, pass the phone to your owner.
-<i>Sir, somebody wants to talk to you.</i>

1456
01:36:51,916 --> 01:36:54,333
Why would you bring
a broken camera to the shoot?

1457
01:36:54,416 --> 01:36:58,166
The college management wouldn't let us use
a mobile saying that you'll telecast it.

1458
01:36:58,291 --> 01:37:01,708
I would have looked better in that.
In your camera, I look blurred.

1459
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:05,791
<i>Hear me out. Only you look blurred</i>
<i>in the entire video, right?</i>

1460
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,625
<i>Think about it.</i>
<i>Your boyfriend</i>

1461
01:37:08,708 --> 01:37:11,875
<i>fought with the videographer,</i>
<i>got the tape and did this.</i>

1462
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:15,500
<i>I kept scolding the boys that</i>
<i>they ruined the channel's image.</i>

1463
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:18,291
<i>And it's all because of you.</i>
<i>Ask him.</i>

1464
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,375
-What happened, Aunt?
-Nothing.

1465
01:37:25,333 --> 01:37:27,166
Do you know how much I love to dance?

1466
01:37:27,958 --> 01:37:30,041
If you didn't like it,
you should've said so.

1467
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:31,625
But you humiliated me!

1468
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:34,833
Listen. Don't take advantage of me
just because we're in love.

1469
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,166
Don't behave like a psycho, I beg you.

1470
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:42,958
Sign here.

1471
01:37:48,041 --> 01:37:51,250
Charge the phone for eight hours.
Then you can use it.

1472
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:11,541
<i>To my man riding the chariot</i>

1473
01:38:12,208 --> 01:38:17,375
<i>Turn to me and give me a kiss</i>

1474
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:18,916
Sembuli, here you go!

1475
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:25,000
<i>I will look for you and reach to kiss you</i>

1476
01:38:25,791 --> 01:38:31,250
<i>Love is a perennial river</i>
<i>Nothing can stop its flow</i>

1477
01:38:32,333 --> 01:38:37,958
<i>Every soul on this earth</i>

1478
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:45,000
<i>Wants nothing but love!</i>

1479
01:38:45,583 --> 01:38:51,583
<i>Every soul on this earth</i>
<i>Wants nothing but love!</i>

1480
01:38:55,166 --> 01:38:57,625
If he has some problem with me,
why can't he talk it out?

1481
01:38:58,125 --> 01:38:59,916
Why is he avoiding me, Uncle?

1482
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,875
<i>I am yearning for him</i>

1483
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:12,750
<i>Will he just abandon me?</i>

1484
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:20,666
<i>I am left stranded on the streets...</i>

1485
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,833
I'm sorry that I spoke so harsh.
Please forgive me.

1486
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:27,416
<i>Console me with your words</i>

1487
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:35,708
<i>I wear a sari and stroll to the shop</i>
<i>Hoping to see you there</i>

1488
01:39:35,791 --> 01:39:40,708
<i>The sound of your footsteps</i>
<i>Gives me anxiety</i>

1489
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:42,458
-I'll leave, Uncle.
-Okay.

1490
01:40:02,541 --> 01:40:06,000
<i>Your fate is twisted now</i>

1491
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:10,291
<i>And it will make sure</i>
<i>That you two separate</i>

1492
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:22,916
<i>If money lenders come asking for him,</i>
<i>I wouldn't rat him out.</i>

1493
01:40:23,541 --> 01:40:25,541
<i>He'd do the same for me.</i>

1494
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:44,375
Will you get me enrolled in the hostel?

1495
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:48,041
I can't concentrate on my studies at home.

1496
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:50,208
Relatives keep visiting us.

1497
01:40:50,708 --> 01:40:52,291
I also want some change.

1498
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:56,208
Please, Dad, let me stay in the hostel.

1499
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:59,375
-Did you talk to your mother about this?
-No.

1500
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:02,750
Okay, dear.
Have I ever said no to you?

1501
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:04,541
I will talk to your mother.

1502
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:08,083
-Bye, dear.
-Drive carefully.

1503
01:41:08,166 --> 01:41:09,875
-Okay, sir.
-Call me when you reach.

1504
01:41:09,958 --> 01:41:11,958
-When will she return?
-Bid her goodbye!

1505
01:41:43,791 --> 01:41:44,708
Naachiya!

1506
01:41:46,375 --> 01:41:48,541
I have kept the oil
and chilli powder on top.

1507
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:51,333
Keep those in your cabinet first. Okay?

1508
01:41:52,375 --> 01:41:54,125
-Naachiya!
-Fine, Mom. I will do it.

1509
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:57,416
Naachiya!

1510
01:42:38,041 --> 01:42:40,166
You are Muthukutty's son, right?

1511
01:42:40,375 --> 01:42:41,750
-Yes!
-Get up.

1512
01:42:43,375 --> 01:42:44,458
You want liquor?

1513
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:48,375
Your father skinned a cat
and sold it to me as rabbit meat.

1514
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:51,958
Someone found out and spread
the news everywhere.

1515
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:54,458
I had to pull so many tricks
to get the sales up.

1516
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:57,375
Losers!
Hey, no booze for you. Get out!

1517
01:42:57,541 --> 01:43:00,666
Tell him that I kicked you out.
Only then will he regret his actions.

1518
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:01,666
Get lost!

1519
01:43:03,583 --> 01:43:07,250
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, come here.

1520
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:09,541
He is breaking the chair!
Hey, come here!

1521
01:43:09,708 --> 01:43:11,500
Sir, he passed away last night.

1522
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:13,458
-Who?
-His father.

1523
01:43:14,208 --> 01:43:16,000
Hey, what are you saying?

1524
01:43:17,541 --> 01:43:19,375
Nobody informed me.

1525
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:21,000
Son, I'm sorry.

1526
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:24,666
Your dad is the reason
for the growth of this place.

1527
01:43:25,041 --> 01:43:26,416
He's my old friend.

1528
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:29,541
He made a mess of my business.
So, I spoke out of anger.

1529
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:31,791
He's the reason I'm alive.

1530
01:43:31,916 --> 01:43:33,458
When I was down with jaundice

1531
01:43:33,541 --> 01:43:36,166
he brought the doctor
at the right time and saved me.

1532
01:43:36,291 --> 01:43:39,500
He's my savior.
Son, have it.

1533
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:43,583
-Go away.
-Please forgive me. Take this.

1534
01:43:43,666 --> 01:43:49,000
Please take this.
Hey, please give this to him.

1535
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:50,583
-You're a...
-Go on, have it.

1536
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,333
When they sang his praise,
I just felt angry!

1537
01:43:58,166 --> 01:44:02,166
But if someone badmouths him,
I lose my mind.

1538
01:44:12,458 --> 01:44:13,666
It's my pendant!

1539
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:16,083
He pawned it when I was a kid.

1540
01:44:16,916 --> 01:44:18,833
You used to wear it around your waist.

1541
01:44:20,333 --> 01:44:22,083
I have no idea when he got it back

1542
01:44:22,875 --> 01:44:24,291
and kept it here.

1543
01:44:24,666 --> 01:44:26,833
I used to hide money in this place.

1544
01:44:29,583 --> 01:44:33,166
If he had kept it here, he must've
believed that I'd check someday, right?

1545
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,500
How long would he have waited?

1546
01:44:36,583 --> 01:44:39,375
Be glad that you found it now.

1547
01:44:44,333 --> 01:44:45,500
This is his shirt.

1548
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:52,125
The launderer stamps this seal
to identify Dad's shirt.

1549
01:44:54,458 --> 01:44:57,958
Hey, the bill for the flowers
and the garland.

1550
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:00,500
-Is it with you?
-I gave it to you.

1551
01:45:04,166 --> 01:45:06,625
-What's the date today?
-It's 12.

1552
01:45:08,125 --> 01:45:10,708
Dad passed away last evening.
That's 11.

1553
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:13,833
But the order for the garlands
was placed on the 10th.

1554
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:17,625
So somebody knew
that he was going to die.

1555
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:19,458
Who?

1556
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:21,333
Sir, get up.

1557
01:45:22,208 --> 01:45:23,416
What happened?

1558
01:45:23,541 --> 01:45:24,583
Who ordered this?

1559
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,250
Who gave the advance?

1560
01:45:26,333 --> 01:45:30,291
The person said it's for a funeral.
He wasn't a local.

1561
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:33,750
Only when I came to your house did I
realize that it was for your father.

1562
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:38,083
Some outsider paid the advance.
There was no sadness on his face.

1563
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:41,291
He gave the order happily.
I can identify him.

1564
01:45:41,375 --> 01:45:43,458
I can find him even if he is in disguise.

1565
01:46:35,375 --> 01:46:37,791
Hey, stop! I said stop!

1566
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,500
If I catch you...

1567
01:46:41,291 --> 01:46:42,333
Stop right there!

1568
01:46:43,416 --> 01:46:45,250
He doesn't know how to climb a tree.

1569
01:46:50,166 --> 01:46:51,083
Hey!

1570
01:46:55,666 --> 01:46:57,666
Hey, stop. Get down!

1571
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,208
-Come down
-Let go of my leg.

1572
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,958
You shameless fellow!

1573
01:47:04,166 --> 01:47:05,625
-Won't you change?
-You change.

1574
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:07,708
I can kill you right now!

1575
01:47:08,166 --> 01:47:10,458
-Do we look like fools?
-Hey!

1576
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:15,083
Remember what you did?
You ate <i>parotta</i> and burped in my face.

1577
01:47:15,458 --> 01:47:18,750
You paid for my insurance
so that you get paid when I die.

1578
01:47:18,958 --> 01:47:21,500
You vulture, you think
I don't know anything! Go away!

1579
01:47:21,875 --> 01:47:23,875
You better get down!

1580
01:47:24,583 --> 01:47:25,583
I won't!

1581
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:27,708
I'm going to thrash you now!

1582
01:47:28,625 --> 01:47:30,791
-Get down!
-Hey!

1583
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,583
-Cheenu!
-Welcome.

1584
01:47:32,666 --> 01:47:35,041
I came all this way
to get my beard shaved.

1585
01:47:35,125 --> 01:47:36,875
Of course. Where else would you go?

1586
01:47:36,958 --> 01:47:38,958
SALON

1587
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:52,541
Hey, are you a lookalike of mine?

1588
01:47:52,916 --> 01:47:54,875
I thought something was wrong with me.

1589
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:57,458
He is the owner of the sweet stall.
Don't you know?

1590
01:47:57,583 --> 01:47:58,541
Sweets?

1591
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:06,416
Hey, did your mother sell <i>boondhi</i>?

1592
01:48:10,416 --> 01:48:15,041
When my father kept supplying
<i>boondhi</i> to every nook and corner,

1593
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:17,375
I suspected that there was an affair.

1594
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:20,708
But how did you escape
my eyes for so long?

1595
01:48:21,708 --> 01:48:24,625
I am wondering the same! How?

1596
01:48:24,708 --> 01:48:28,375
Only our father can answer that question.

1597
01:48:29,958 --> 01:48:30,958
What's your name?

1598
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:34,000
Sudhakar. But everyone calls me Leftovers.

1599
01:48:34,083 --> 01:48:35,125
Leftovers?

1600
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:39,208
As a kid, I used to beg people
for their leftovers.

1601
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:43,208
-How else would a fatherless kid survive?
-He used to visit you often, right?

1602
01:48:43,708 --> 01:48:47,333
I never knew when he would visit.
He never did anything for us.

1603
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:51,583
He'd even take away the <i>boondhi</i>
my mother prepared to sell.

1604
01:48:51,958 --> 01:48:53,750
He lived his life to the fullest!

1605
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:58,000
But it didn't last long.

1606
01:48:58,166 --> 01:49:00,250
He'd have lived longer
if he had stayed here.

1607
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:04,375
He went to Andaman
and passed away there.

1608
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,541
People usually go to Singapore
or Qatar for work, right?

1609
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:11,083
Do you know why he went to Andaman?

1610
01:49:11,166 --> 01:49:14,083
For that, you should first know about
our grandfather! Ever heard of him?

1611
01:49:14,166 --> 01:49:17,875
Yes, I know.
He was a freedom fighter.

1612
01:49:20,166 --> 01:49:23,666
He had called his British friend
to play a round of cards.

1613
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:26,666
He was calling him out saying,
"Come out, you white guy".

1614
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:29,583
Other Britishers thought he was staging
a coup

1615
01:49:29,666 --> 01:49:31,625
and jailed him in Andaman.

1616
01:49:31,708 --> 01:49:33,750
But everyone thinks he is a martyr!

1617
01:49:34,708 --> 01:49:36,708
-Is that so?
-Yes.

1618
01:49:36,875 --> 01:49:40,625
Our father wanted to visit grandfather's
resting place and he also passed away.

1619
01:49:41,166 --> 01:49:45,708
Since so many from our family
went to Andaman and died there,

1620
01:49:45,791 --> 01:49:48,541
I was curious to visit Andaman too.

1621
01:49:48,625 --> 01:49:49,541
But no luck.

1622
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,166
I've taken a vow to visit
Andaman before I die.

1623
01:49:54,583 --> 01:49:56,666
But I haven't even been to Chennai yet.

1624
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,958
I travel to Chennai often.

1625
01:49:59,083 --> 01:50:00,541
I have work there.

1626
01:50:00,708 --> 01:50:03,041
I'm working hard to open a shop there.

1627
01:50:03,125 --> 01:50:06,583
My son is in Chennai too.
But we are not on talking terms.

1628
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:10,125
Yet, he loves me a lot.
He transfers money every month.

1629
01:50:10,208 --> 01:50:11,708
I get a receipt from the bank.

1630
01:50:12,666 --> 01:50:14,583
But I won't withdraw it.

1631
01:50:14,916 --> 01:50:17,833
Let him hand it over directly.
Then, I'll take it!

1632
01:50:17,916 --> 01:50:20,083
He has transferred money
this month as well.

1633
01:50:20,166 --> 01:50:21,791
See, here's the receipt.

1634
01:50:27,041 --> 01:50:30,000
Hey, you can't withdraw this
whenever you want.

1635
01:50:30,083 --> 01:50:33,916
This is an insurance scheme.
If you die, your son will get the money.

1636
01:50:34,416 --> 01:50:36,625
If I die, will my son get the money?

1637
01:50:36,708 --> 01:50:38,583
Yes. Ten lakh rupees.

1638
01:50:38,666 --> 01:50:42,541
He pays only a couple of thousands.
But the settlement is in lakhs.

1639
01:50:43,333 --> 01:50:45,208
-Lakhs?
-Ten lakhs.

1640
01:50:52,833 --> 01:50:55,958
All this while, I thought my son
was doing this out of affection.

1641
01:50:56,625 --> 01:50:58,583
He never talks to me.

1642
01:50:58,666 --> 01:51:01,625
But I hoped that there's some love
left in his heart for me.

1643
01:51:01,708 --> 01:51:03,583
There is nothing called love.

1644
01:51:03,666 --> 01:51:05,166
Everybody needs money.

1645
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:07,583
And your son's plan is very clean.

1646
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:10,333
He shouldn't get this money.

1647
01:51:10,416 --> 01:51:12,125
-Is there a way to stop it?
-A way?

1648
01:51:12,375 --> 01:51:13,875
The only way is that you shouldn't die.

1649
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:16,250
Or act like you're dead.

1650
01:51:17,083 --> 01:51:19,750
If you do that, even you have
a chance of getting that money.

1651
01:51:19,833 --> 01:51:21,291
Will I really get it?

1652
01:51:21,541 --> 01:51:22,666
How?

1653
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:25,500
You sign a document saying
you borrowed money from me.

1654
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:27,958
Fine, even a thumbprint should work.

1655
01:51:28,083 --> 01:51:29,208
Let's trap him.

1656
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:32,958
I will get the insurance money
from your son and give it to you.

1657
01:51:33,041 --> 01:51:34,166
How's my idea?

1658
01:51:35,625 --> 01:51:39,041
Well, I can act dead
until I'm getting buried

1659
01:51:39,416 --> 01:51:41,250
but how do we trick people after that?

1660
01:51:41,333 --> 01:51:43,541
Is that even an issue?
We'll set your house on fire.

1661
01:51:43,625 --> 01:51:46,000
When people run for their lives

1662
01:51:46,083 --> 01:51:50,708
let's burn another body or some meat
and conclude that your body got burnt.

1663
01:51:50,791 --> 01:51:55,291
Before setting the fire, I'll distract
everyone and get you out. That's it!

1664
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,291
Let's book a ticket to Andaman.

1665
01:51:57,625 --> 01:52:01,166
Illegitimate child with illegal ways.

1666
01:52:03,333 --> 01:52:04,333
Just drink!

1667
01:52:31,208 --> 01:52:33,416
Were you snoring?

1668
01:52:33,625 --> 01:52:35,791
Thankfully, there are only
oldies outside.

1669
01:52:35,875 --> 01:52:36,958
Control yourself!

1670
01:52:46,333 --> 01:52:47,291
Shake it well.

1671
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:49,000
Lift his chin and feed him.

1672
01:52:50,625 --> 01:52:51,833
Drink this juice.

1673
01:52:52,083 --> 01:52:54,166
I have asked them to give sugarcane juice.

1674
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:56,125
And doze off for a while.
Pour it.

1675
01:52:56,208 --> 01:52:58,458
His son is coming from Chennai only now.

1676
01:52:58,541 --> 01:53:02,458
He has come to see his father's cold body.
Poor thing must be hurting so much.

1677
01:53:15,125 --> 01:53:18,208
-He opened his eyes, Mom.
-Oh, no! Don't say such things.

1678
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:20,541
His eyes opened.
I saw it, Mom.

1679
01:53:20,916 --> 01:53:23,375
-What is he saying?
-He's scared of something.

1680
01:53:23,458 --> 01:53:25,458
-Come here, my child.
-Nothing will happen!

1681
01:53:25,541 --> 01:53:30,583
We'll get some talisman to ward off
the evil. Don't you worry.

1682
01:53:31,083 --> 01:53:35,541
Brother, the petrol cans are in place.
Let's finish it off secretly.

1683
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:39,291
When people are not around,
let's bring him out and burn the shelter!

1684
01:53:39,375 --> 01:53:41,375
Don't speak like an idiot.

1685
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:44,250
Did you mean burn the house?

1686
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:45,333
Why, idiot?

1687
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:51,291
Why should I hand him the money?
Do I look like a martyr to you?

1688
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:56,875
I'll stop his breath with a pillow
and finish things off.

1689
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:03,208
He's sleeping with bandages already.
Let's finish him off and grab his money.

1690
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,458
Listen, don't think of me as a monster.

1691
01:54:08,208 --> 01:54:10,791
He laughs at me saying
that I'm illegitimate.

1692
01:54:10,875 --> 01:54:13,166
-He laughs at my name.
-That's very bad, sir!

1693
01:54:13,333 --> 01:54:15,916
You know why I carried
the byname for so long?

1694
01:54:16,333 --> 01:54:19,458
I wanted to remember
the pain I went through.

1695
01:54:22,666 --> 01:54:25,583
Legitimate child, it seems.
Let him die legitimately too!

1696
01:54:25,708 --> 01:54:27,125
-Of course!
- Yes.

1697
01:54:28,916 --> 01:54:29,958
Let's finish it.

1698
01:54:31,458 --> 01:54:37,458
<i>Muthukutty left us all</i>
<i>He has left us all</i>

1699
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:43,083
<i>I built a bier for you</i>

1700
01:54:43,291 --> 01:54:46,750
<i>Oh, my sir, I built a bier for you!</i>

1701
01:55:01,875 --> 01:55:05,083
<i>Hey, you...</i>

1702
01:55:08,833 --> 01:55:11,916
<i>The late Muthukutty</i>
<i>Is leaving for the afterworld</i>

1703
01:55:13,583 --> 01:55:16,875
<i>Let's pray for him to rest in peace</i>

1704
01:55:45,458 --> 01:55:48,125
You paid for my insurance
to benefit from my death, right?

1705
01:55:49,250 --> 01:55:52,541
What? Benefit from your death?

1706
01:55:53,333 --> 01:55:56,333
Is that what you think of me?
I'll kick you!

1707
01:55:59,958 --> 01:56:02,500
I swear I didn't pay for your insurance
to benefit from it.

1708
01:56:02,958 --> 01:56:05,458
I thought of giving you
the money after five years.

1709
01:56:05,666 --> 01:56:07,916
For how long can you ride your bicycle?

1710
01:56:10,833 --> 01:56:13,958
I planned to fix that broken house
and make you comfortable.

1711
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:17,208
You've done enough to repay me.

1712
01:56:17,875 --> 01:56:21,583
But you won't get the money
unless I die, right?

1713
01:56:22,791 --> 01:56:25,041
Would I have received it
even if I was alive?

1714
01:56:29,541 --> 01:56:32,291
You didn't even shed tears
when you saw me as a corpse.

1715
01:56:34,708 --> 01:56:36,583
What have you done to deserve my tears?

1716
01:56:38,750 --> 01:56:43,333
I thought you'll leave this nest
and be happy in another.

1717
01:56:43,791 --> 01:56:46,625
Now you're dancing as if nothing happened.

1718
01:56:48,708 --> 01:56:51,041
Maybe if you had really died,
I might have cried.

1719
01:56:52,208 --> 01:56:53,833
Thankfully, you didn't.

1720
01:56:54,041 --> 01:56:55,666
Please don't speak that way, my son.

1721
01:56:56,333 --> 01:56:58,875
I didn't intend to trouble you.

1722
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:02,791
They conspired against me.

1723
01:57:02,875 --> 01:57:05,125
I listened to their words
and did all this.

1724
01:57:09,333 --> 01:57:12,875
The moment I realized that my son
wouldn't cry for my death

1725
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:16,375
I felt dead.

1726
01:57:22,625 --> 01:57:25,041
I feel like hanging myself.

1727
01:57:27,458 --> 01:57:28,916
But I don't have the courage.

1728
01:57:31,916 --> 01:57:37,375
See! Gather your courage
and confess your actions to the cops.

1729
01:57:38,833 --> 01:57:40,291
Fine, I'll confess.

1730
01:57:41,416 --> 01:57:42,458
Wash your face first.

1731
01:57:55,333 --> 01:57:56,666
Yes, fix your dress, please.

1732
01:57:56,750 --> 01:58:00,708
Because even if we shoot well,
the groom will meddle with the tapes

1733
01:58:00,791 --> 01:58:02,416
like he did with the dance video.

1734
01:58:02,791 --> 01:58:04,125
It has been a year, right?

1735
01:58:04,375 --> 01:58:07,333
I left that job and came
to shoot wedding videos.

1736
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,500
To my surprise,
I'm shooting your wedding.

1737
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,791
Can you wait outside, please?
I'll call you.

1738
01:58:16,583 --> 01:58:19,416
-Who are you talking about?
-I'm talking about the groom.

1739
01:58:19,958 --> 01:58:22,458
Your dress was slightly torn
during the dance.

1740
01:58:22,583 --> 01:58:25,583
He got the tape and ensured
that you were not visible at all.

1741
01:58:25,666 --> 01:58:28,083
He stayed quiet to prevent others
from learning about it.

1742
01:58:28,166 --> 01:58:32,291
When you were dancing, some guys
shouted and he was really pissed off.

1743
01:58:32,375 --> 01:58:36,250
It's his duty to protect
his girlfriend's dignity.

1744
01:58:36,333 --> 01:58:37,875
Now, he'll do it as a husband.

1745
01:58:37,958 --> 01:58:40,625
Parthy is not the groom.

1746
01:58:43,541 --> 01:58:47,750
Sorry! I thought he'd be the groom.

1747
01:58:48,875 --> 01:58:52,416
I brought up the past like an idiot.

1748
01:58:53,375 --> 01:58:54,416
I'm sorry.

1749
01:58:57,875 --> 01:58:59,875
TRUTH WILL TRIUMPH

1750
01:59:13,875 --> 01:59:19,750
The one who went from Earth
to Heaven to sell ice cream.

1751
01:59:19,833 --> 01:59:22,416
Our dear Android and Angry Bird

1752
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,583
and 'Mad Max' Muthukutty!

1753
01:59:24,833 --> 01:59:26,041
Stupidity!

1754
01:59:50,166 --> 01:59:51,333
Sir!

1755
01:59:52,083 --> 01:59:53,958
Please forgive me, Mad Max!

1756
01:59:55,333 --> 01:59:57,541
I-I made a mistake.

1757
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:05,666
<i>Hey, you...</i>

1758
02:00:06,291 --> 02:00:11,583
<i>Hey, you...</i>

1759
02:00:33,708 --> 02:00:35,375
Hey, stop!

1760
02:00:38,708 --> 02:00:40,125
WELCOME TO THE WEDDING
OF R VIGNESH AND L NAACHIYA

1761
02:00:41,208 --> 02:00:43,583
Son, look at this banner.

1762
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:51,750
Why are you just driving away?

1763
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,416
You pushed me aside because I'm a wastrel.

1764
02:00:57,958 --> 02:00:59,125
I deserve it.

1765
02:00:59,583 --> 02:01:00,791
But what did she do?

1766
02:01:01,208 --> 02:01:04,333
What are you trying to prove
by acting indifferent towards her?

1767
02:01:06,166 --> 02:01:07,750
She has decided to get married.

1768
02:01:07,833 --> 02:01:11,291
Do you expect me
to stand against her wishes?

1769
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,791
Naachiya was the only soul
that truly shed tears for me.

1770
02:01:17,250 --> 02:01:21,125
She loved you a lot
and kept asking about you.

1771
02:01:21,375 --> 02:01:25,916
I thought she would take
good care of you.

1772
02:01:26,333 --> 02:01:27,916
I don't know what happened.

1773
02:01:28,041 --> 02:01:30,125
Now, she has decided
to marry someone else.

1774
02:01:31,625 --> 02:01:33,875
You should stop being so stubborn!

1775
02:01:34,375 --> 02:01:35,416
What do you mean?

1776
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:39,166
-You're talking as if I'm avoiding her.
-Aren't you?

1777
02:01:39,833 --> 02:01:42,666
She waited at our doorstep the entire day.

1778
02:01:43,083 --> 02:01:46,625
You shut the door and remained inside.

1779
02:01:47,666 --> 02:01:50,083
Poor girl!
She was so heartbroken!

1780
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,666
I was drunk that day.
So I couldn't console her.

1781
02:02:00,666 --> 02:02:03,458
-Did she come when I was home?
-Yes.

1782
02:02:05,958 --> 02:02:10,208
Why didn't you knock on my door?
How could I have known that she was there?

1783
02:02:10,666 --> 02:02:11,750
What have you done?

1784
02:02:14,166 --> 02:02:16,125
Did I tell you that I was avoiding her?

1785
02:02:17,583 --> 02:02:20,083
How would you have known?
You were drunk at that time!

1786
02:02:20,875 --> 02:02:23,875
You ruined my life
by getting drunk all the time.

1787
02:02:26,458 --> 02:02:27,875
You've ruined my life!

1788
02:02:31,708 --> 02:02:36,333
Ever since I was a child,
you brought me nothing but shame.

1789
02:02:37,791 --> 02:02:39,458
I lost everything because of you.

1790
02:02:40,291 --> 02:02:42,041
I've lost everything.

1791
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,375
You are here just to ruin my peace.

1792
02:02:50,625 --> 02:02:52,000
Hey, come here.

1793
02:02:55,583 --> 02:02:56,416
Give me that ball.

1794
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,375
My life is ruined.

1795
02:03:13,625 --> 02:03:16,500
Naachiya, my dear! Please see this.

1796
02:03:23,625 --> 02:03:25,291
R VIGNESH WEDS L NAACHIYA

1797
02:03:49,791 --> 02:03:51,458
I don't want that money, son!

1798
02:03:52,125 --> 02:03:55,666
Not even a penny.
I'll go somewhere.

1799
02:03:56,666 --> 02:04:00,166
Take the money
and live happily with that girl.

1800
02:04:01,625 --> 02:04:03,708
Ask her father for her hand in marriage.

1801
02:04:05,166 --> 02:04:06,916
Go to their house.

1802
02:04:08,791 --> 02:04:10,333
Did you eat something?

1803
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:11,875
No.

1804
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:13,458
Get in.

1805
02:04:22,041 --> 02:04:23,583
She is here.

1806
02:04:24,541 --> 02:04:27,208
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

1807
02:04:27,291 --> 02:04:30,666
What happened?
Say something.

1808
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:33,458
I heard that my dress was torn
during the dance.

1809
02:04:33,541 --> 02:04:36,750
That happened long ago.
Why are you crying over it now?

1810
02:04:38,583 --> 02:04:41,500
So you knew that my dress was torn?

1811
02:04:44,125 --> 02:04:46,666
Why didn't you tell me?

1812
02:04:47,166 --> 02:04:49,375
We didn't want you to feel bad.

1813
02:04:52,208 --> 02:04:53,833
My God!

1814
02:04:55,958 --> 02:04:58,375
-I want to go to Parthy.
-What?

1815
02:04:58,458 --> 02:05:01,000
-I am going to elope.
-What do you mean?

1816
02:05:01,583 --> 02:05:04,375
I'm serious.
I want to go to Parthy.

1817
02:05:05,708 --> 02:05:08,750
We are actually happy
that you've decided to elope.

1818
02:05:09,708 --> 02:05:12,000
The groom was staring at us
in a wrong way.

1819
02:05:12,833 --> 02:05:14,916
We were wondering how to tell you that.

1820
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:15,958
Keep wondering.

1821
02:05:16,041 --> 02:05:19,083
Just keep wondering.
That's what friends are for, right?

1822
02:05:19,375 --> 02:05:20,416
Hey...

1823
02:05:23,833 --> 02:05:27,291
Listen, everything is going to be fine.

1824
02:05:27,625 --> 02:05:28,583
I promise!

1825
02:05:28,666 --> 02:05:30,333
Don't cry, please.

1826
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:35,625
Let's see who stands in our way.
Come with me.

1827
02:05:35,708 --> 02:05:39,958
<i>It doesn't matter what is in your way</i>

1828
02:05:40,708 --> 02:05:44,916
<i>March on with your head held high</i>

1829
02:05:45,291 --> 02:05:46,958
-Did you have dinner?
-I did, dear.

1830
02:05:47,208 --> 02:05:48,583
Did you see the bride?

1831
02:05:49,541 --> 02:05:50,500
Hello, dear!

1832
02:05:50,625 --> 02:05:52,041
Have you applied henna?

1833
02:05:52,125 --> 02:05:54,916
Not yet. The beautician is here.
We've selected the design.

1834
02:05:55,041 --> 02:05:58,458
-We just have to get it applied.
-Okay. Let me know.

1835
02:05:59,125 --> 02:06:02,041
Are you still tying the garland?
There are more flowers inside.

1836
02:06:02,125 --> 02:06:04,875
-Enough with the decoration.
-It'll be over soon.

1837
02:06:06,833 --> 02:06:09,750
Where will you look for him? His house?

1838
02:06:09,875 --> 02:06:12,250
Let me visit the temple first
and seek blessings.

1839
02:06:17,041 --> 02:06:18,583
He has been lying down

1840
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:22,291
controlling his appetite
and his other needs.

1841
02:06:22,916 --> 02:06:26,083
-Such a difficult task!
-No one doubted him.

1842
02:06:27,125 --> 02:06:29,125
Not even when he disappeared.

1843
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,333
What are we going
to tell the villagers?

1844
02:06:35,208 --> 02:06:37,625
Buddy, how are we going to keep him safe?

1845
02:06:38,166 --> 02:06:41,166
Do you remember Suresh from school?

1846
02:06:41,375 --> 02:06:43,625
-Yes.
-He drives a mortuary hearse.

1847
02:06:43,708 --> 02:06:45,958
Yes, he's a friend.
Shall I ask him to come?

1848
02:06:46,041 --> 02:06:47,333
Yes, call him immediately.

1849
02:06:47,708 --> 02:06:49,875
-Who?
-Suresh.

1850
02:06:49,958 --> 02:06:52,125
He drives a mortuary hearse
for the government hospital.

1851
02:07:22,416 --> 02:07:25,791
Hey! Why do you carry such a big sickle?

1852
02:07:26,958 --> 02:07:29,125
Had I been a little careless,
they'd have killed me.

1853
02:07:30,708 --> 02:07:33,375
They would've finished me
within a matter of seconds.

1854
02:07:35,125 --> 02:07:39,291
It was my luck that
I heard what he said.

1855
02:07:39,458 --> 02:07:40,625
And I escaped from there.

1856
02:07:41,583 --> 02:07:43,416
But what did I get?

1857
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:45,125
Nothing.

1858
02:07:47,416 --> 02:07:50,583
My son is all alone.

1859
02:07:51,541 --> 02:07:54,125
My dear Naachiya...

1860
02:07:54,875 --> 02:07:57,250
She has decided to get married
to someone else.

1861
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:00,625
You just keep watching on.

1862
02:08:01,541 --> 02:08:03,125
Don't do any good for us.

1863
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:21,375
Hey, Naachiya!

1864
02:08:22,875 --> 02:08:23,875
Uncle?

1865
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:27,083
Uncle?

1866
02:08:27,541 --> 02:08:29,041
-Uncle!
-Naachiya, dear!

1867
02:08:30,458 --> 02:08:31,666
I knew it!

1868
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:34,250
You wouldn't have gone
anywhere without telling me.

1869
02:08:34,916 --> 02:08:39,666
When I visited you, I cried so much
and wished it was all a dream.

1870
02:08:39,833 --> 02:08:42,166
It feels like I woke up from a nightmare.

1871
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:44,458
My sweetheart!

1872
02:08:52,125 --> 02:08:56,666
Forgive me, Uncle.
I misunderstood your son.

1873
02:08:56,750 --> 02:09:01,458
What's this?
Don't cry, okay?

1874
02:09:02,083 --> 02:09:05,833
I've run away from home.
Ask your son to take me with him.

1875
02:09:12,208 --> 02:09:15,250
Ayyanar, my Lord!

1876
02:09:15,333 --> 02:09:18,041
Protector of my family!

1877
02:09:18,958 --> 02:09:22,708
I made a mistake!
Forgive me, God!

1878
02:09:23,583 --> 02:09:28,458
I spoke rudely to you.
Please forgive me!

1879
02:09:28,666 --> 02:09:32,291
Lord Ayyanar.
You're omnipresent!

1880
02:09:32,375 --> 02:09:35,291
You have always protected my family!

1881
02:09:37,375 --> 02:09:39,208
Buddy, just a minute.

1882
02:09:41,041 --> 02:09:43,916
He didn't answer my call.
I'll bring him myself.

1883
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,458
-We only need the van.
-I'll bring the van.

1884
02:09:48,041 --> 02:09:49,083
Naachiya is here.

1885
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:52,666
-Looks like she has eloped.
-I hope everything goes well.

1886
02:09:57,125 --> 02:09:58,375
Won't you talk to me?

1887
02:10:01,791 --> 02:10:05,041
What is wrong with you?
If you have a problem, say it aloud.

1888
02:10:10,208 --> 02:10:11,458
How could you do this?

1889
02:10:12,625 --> 02:10:15,708
Even though we didn't talk,
I never thought we were separated.

1890
02:10:18,750 --> 02:10:21,125
I never thought
that you will abandon me...

1891
02:10:23,875 --> 02:10:26,625
I believed that
you'd understand my love.

1892
02:10:28,208 --> 02:10:30,375
But you stopped talking
to me altogether.

1893
02:10:30,791 --> 02:10:33,791
-Your phone means the world now!
-Don't act like you care!

1894
02:10:33,875 --> 02:10:36,416
If I hadn't come here,
wouldn't you have abandoned me?

1895
02:10:36,541 --> 02:10:38,708
Didn't you say that you don't need me?

1896
02:10:43,250 --> 02:10:44,666
I saw you at the riverside.

1897
02:10:46,250 --> 02:10:49,000
You looked happy.
That's why I said it.

1898
02:10:50,583 --> 02:10:52,708
I didn't know what happened
at that moment.

1899
02:10:53,458 --> 02:10:57,666
You looked at me. A smile comes to my face
when I know that you're looking at me.

1900
02:10:58,333 --> 02:11:00,291
Our problems, my wedding,
your situation...

1901
02:11:00,375 --> 02:11:01,875
Nothing came to my mind.

1902
02:11:35,041 --> 02:11:36,083
Parthy!

1903
02:11:38,041 --> 02:11:41,166
What is this, darling?
How could you do this?

1904
02:11:41,541 --> 02:11:44,541
Couldn't you wait until
our wedding to have an affair?

1905
02:11:44,916 --> 02:11:48,458
What are you looking at?
I won't complain to anyone.

1906
02:11:48,541 --> 02:11:50,458
You're my investment, baby!

1907
02:11:50,541 --> 02:11:53,458
And our business deal closes only
when I tie the knot, right?

1908
02:11:54,166 --> 02:11:56,583
How could you abandon me like this?

1909
02:11:56,958 --> 02:11:59,125
Let's go!

1910
02:11:59,416 --> 02:12:00,375
Parthy!

1911
02:12:00,458 --> 02:12:01,375
-Come, darling!
-Get up!

1912
02:12:01,458 --> 02:12:02,833
-Don't touch me!
-Let's go.

1913
02:12:02,916 --> 02:12:03,916
-Let's go!
-Let her go.

1914
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,583
-Thrash him, guys.
-Parthy!

1915
02:12:06,750 --> 02:12:07,583
Let go of me!

1916
02:12:12,166 --> 02:12:14,958
-Let me go. Parthy!
-Stop creating a scene.

1917
02:12:20,666 --> 02:12:22,541
Parthy! Parthy!

1918
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:24,750
Come on!

1919
02:12:41,666 --> 02:12:43,125
Help me out here!

1920
02:12:47,041 --> 02:12:48,125
Put her in the car!

1921
02:12:50,041 --> 02:12:52,041
Leave me!

1922
02:12:52,375 --> 02:12:56,583
-Uncle! Parthy!
-Hey!

1923
02:12:57,750 --> 02:13:00,250
-Parthy!
-Get in quickly!

1924
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:10,416
Parthy!

1925
02:13:11,166 --> 02:13:13,458
Parthy... Hey...

1926
02:13:15,875 --> 02:13:19,250
Oh, God!
Parthy!

1927
02:13:20,875 --> 02:13:23,208
Blood...

1928
02:13:25,291 --> 02:13:29,250
Hey! Stay awake!
Don't lose consciousness!

1929
02:13:30,875 --> 02:13:32,041
Open your eyes!

1930
02:13:32,208 --> 02:13:33,375
Oh, my God!

1931
02:13:36,125 --> 02:13:37,125
Hold on.

1932
02:13:43,166 --> 02:13:44,416
Parthy...

1933
02:13:53,583 --> 02:13:54,458
Parthy!

1934
02:14:10,375 --> 02:14:14,875
<i>His name will resonate</i>
<i>Across all directions</i>

1935
02:14:14,958 --> 02:14:19,250
<i>Look at him closely,</i>
<i>He is just a child at heart</i>

1936
02:14:19,333 --> 02:14:23,458
<i>Someone who doesn't know</i>
<i>The cruelty of the world</i>

1937
02:14:23,541 --> 02:14:27,708
<i>Yet, he will create a fuss every day</i>

1938
02:14:27,791 --> 02:14:31,916
<i>There's no comparison to his mischief</i>

1939
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,250
<i>And, there's no limit to it</i>

1940
02:14:36,333 --> 02:14:40,666
<i>His name will resonate</i>
<i>Across all directions</i>

1941
02:14:40,750 --> 02:14:45,375
<i>Look at him closely,</i>
<i>He is just a child at heart</i>

1942
02:14:46,416 --> 02:14:50,583
<i>Wearing a dirty </i><i>dhoti</i><i> and colored shirts</i>

1943
02:14:50,666 --> 02:14:54,791
<i>He pedals his cycle hard</i>

1944
02:14:54,875 --> 02:14:59,125
<i>He drinks until he falls unconscious</i>

1945
02:14:59,208 --> 02:15:02,958
<i>He breaks a sweat, day in and day out</i>

1946
02:15:03,041 --> 02:15:07,250
<i>He treats every child as his own</i>

1947
02:15:07,333 --> 02:15:11,583
<i>He treats everyone equally</i>

1948
02:15:11,666 --> 02:15:15,750
<i>Neither is he above the poor</i>

1949
02:15:15,833 --> 02:15:20,000
<i>Nor is he beneath anyone</i>

1950
02:15:20,083 --> 02:15:24,208
<i>He'd steal the hearts of kids</i>
<i>But will act as if he doesn't care</i>

1951
02:15:24,291 --> 02:15:28,833
<i>He'd steal the hearts of kids</i>
<i>But will act as if he doesn't care</i>

1952
02:15:28,916 --> 02:15:33,208
<i>His name will resonate</i>
<i>Across all directions</i>

1953
02:15:33,291 --> 02:15:35,375
<i>Look at him closely...</i>

1954
02:15:35,458 --> 02:15:37,875
Don't worry!
Lord Ayyanar will save you.

1955
02:15:41,125 --> 02:15:43,708
Son, where is your phone?

1956
02:15:46,583 --> 02:15:48,125
Call your friends!

1957
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,583
Hey, come quickly!

1958
02:15:57,041 --> 02:15:59,250
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

1959
02:15:59,333 --> 02:16:00,666
-Parthy!
-Parthy!

1960
02:16:01,041 --> 02:16:03,750
-What happened?
-Get up!

1961
02:16:04,041 --> 02:16:05,916
-He is bleeding heavily!
-Let's go to a hospital.

1962
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,625
-Who did this? Where is Naachiya?
-I don't want to go.

1963
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:11,041
-Who did this?
-Be careful.

1964
02:16:12,166 --> 02:16:14,666
-Be careful.
-They've beat you up badly.

1965
02:16:14,833 --> 02:16:16,458
The situation is getting out of hand.

1966
02:16:16,541 --> 02:16:18,708
-What happened?
-One wants to use the restroom.

1967
02:16:18,833 --> 02:16:22,250
Another guy is drunk
and is adamant on seeing his face.

1968
02:16:22,333 --> 02:16:25,208
Your sister keeps calling me.
Let's go home quickly. Get in.

1969
02:16:58,708 --> 02:17:01,083
Hey, take these away.

1970
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:07,625
What are you waiting for?

1971
02:17:07,708 --> 02:17:09,625
Get started with your performance.

1972
02:17:21,333 --> 02:17:24,125
-Stand closely!
-Do it quickly.

1973
02:17:26,791 --> 02:17:32,541
Who kidnapped you
in this condition?

1974
02:17:33,208 --> 02:17:37,041
Why did you borrow money
from such heartless men?

1975
02:17:37,791 --> 02:17:41,708
You must have gone through an ordeal!

1976
02:17:41,958 --> 02:17:44,125
-Are you seeing all this?
-Meena!

1977
02:17:44,208 --> 02:17:47,541
-He is hearing everything from here.
-Please forgive me, Dad!

1978
02:17:47,625 --> 02:17:51,541
-Meena!
-Forgive me, Dad!

1979
02:18:00,041 --> 02:18:03,000
Forgive me, my dear.

1980
02:18:14,958 --> 02:18:18,000
There's a traffic jam near the market.
So, the car won't go through.

1981
02:18:18,083 --> 02:18:19,583
We'll walk to the town.

1982
02:18:19,666 --> 02:18:22,166
Wait for us at the five-road junction.
Come quickly.

1983
02:18:25,166 --> 02:18:27,250
Hey, is the rope tied properly?

1984
02:18:27,875 --> 02:18:30,750
She'll fool us with her doll face.

1985
02:18:33,375 --> 02:18:35,083
Everybody, please listen to me carefully.

1986
02:18:35,166 --> 02:18:37,125
My father has donated his eyes.

1987
02:18:37,208 --> 02:18:40,708
We received this information a while ago.
We're taking the body to Madurai.

1988
02:18:40,791 --> 02:18:42,666
-To Madurai?
-Yes.

1989
02:18:42,750 --> 02:18:45,083
We'll donate his eyes
and cremate him there.

1990
02:18:45,166 --> 02:18:47,333
If you want,
you can see him one last time.

1991
02:18:47,625 --> 02:18:51,250
-He has donated his eyes.
-Such a commendable deed.

1992
02:18:51,333 --> 02:18:54,083
I used to scold him all the time.
Oh God, forgive me!

1993
02:18:54,166 --> 02:18:57,125
<i>My dear, don't go away</i>

1994
02:18:57,208 --> 02:18:59,458
The eyes should've been donated
within five hours.

1995
02:18:59,541 --> 02:19:02,500
The technology is updated now.
You quench your thirst.

1996
02:19:03,833 --> 02:19:07,833
Be careful.
Move away.

1997
02:19:10,875 --> 02:19:12,208
{\an8}Suresh, hey.

1998
02:19:12,291 --> 02:19:13,666
{\an8}HEARSE

1999
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:16,250
{\an8}-Wait for us at Pazhani bus stand.
-Okay!

2000
02:19:18,416 --> 02:19:20,375
-Dad!
-Move away!

2001
02:19:20,458 --> 02:19:22,958
<i>-You're my precious!</i>
-Move away. Listen.

2002
02:19:23,041 --> 02:19:25,250
-Please listen to me.
<i>-My dear!</i>

2003
02:19:25,333 --> 02:19:28,125
-Calm down.
-<i>What a brilliant idea!</i>

2004
02:19:28,208 --> 02:19:30,375
<i>My son is smart just like me!</i>

2005
02:19:30,833 --> 02:19:32,791
Listen. Move away.

2006
02:19:32,958 --> 02:19:35,333
Ramasamy is not breathing.
Please come here.

2007
02:19:35,416 --> 02:19:38,375
Check up on him.
He needs help.

2008
02:19:38,875 --> 02:19:40,666
What happened to Ramasamy?

2009
02:19:40,833 --> 02:19:42,458
He fell down from the chair.

2010
02:19:42,666 --> 02:19:44,750
Wait for us at Pazhani bus stand.
Get going.

2011
02:19:47,250 --> 02:19:48,833
He passed away suddenly.

2012
02:19:49,541 --> 02:19:52,583
It's true that people who die
on a Saturday don't go alone.

2013
02:19:52,666 --> 02:19:53,875
Very true!

2014
02:20:07,333 --> 02:20:09,125
How dare you try to kill him!

2015
02:20:09,208 --> 02:20:10,833
I was just kidding.

2016
02:20:10,916 --> 02:20:12,666
I was just joking.

2017
02:20:13,041 --> 02:20:14,666
I didn't plan to kill him.

2018
02:20:15,333 --> 02:20:16,958
I knew that he was listening.

2019
02:20:17,041 --> 02:20:18,791
So I decided to prank him.

2020
02:20:20,916 --> 02:20:21,875
Just for fun.

2021
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:26,166
The bier you've built
will be going to waste.

2022
02:20:26,333 --> 02:20:28,833
Shall we use it for Ramasamy instead?

2023
02:20:28,916 --> 02:20:31,291
Sure, sir.
Please take it!

2024
02:20:34,958 --> 02:20:37,791
-You have a big heart.
-I'll make you pay for this!

2025
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,375
Sir, were you really
pretending to be dead?

2026
02:20:43,750 --> 02:20:45,416
Of course.

2027
02:20:48,958 --> 02:20:51,708
Hey, idiots! He has been
roaming about in town.

2028
02:20:51,791 --> 02:20:54,291
His son knows about it too.
What the heck are you doing?

2029
02:20:54,375 --> 02:20:56,250
We're trying to kill him
without a trace.

2030
02:20:56,333 --> 02:20:58,041
That is not possible anymore.

2031
02:20:58,125 --> 02:21:00,583
Have you even killed anyone before?

2032
02:21:00,666 --> 02:21:03,250
Don't doubt us.
We have killed people before.

2033
02:21:03,333 --> 02:21:06,416
He is taking his father away.
He must have a plan.

2034
02:21:07,833 --> 02:21:10,208
Block the van and finish him.
Let the dead stay dead.

2035
02:21:10,291 --> 02:21:11,833
His drama shouldn't be revealed.

2036
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:16,125
I'll finish them both and scare
Meena into giving me the money.

2037
02:21:16,291 --> 02:21:17,208
Block the vehicle.

2038
02:21:17,291 --> 02:21:19,541
I don't trust you. I'm on my way.

2039
02:21:22,958 --> 02:21:26,291
What the heck!
Her location sharing has stopped.

2040
02:21:27,583 --> 02:21:30,833
-They must've snatched the phone.
-What's the last known location?

2041
02:21:31,416 --> 02:21:34,333
-Narikkalpatti Meenakshi Hospital.
-Narikkalpatti?

2042
02:21:34,458 --> 02:21:36,291
It's market time in that area.

2043
02:21:36,375 --> 02:21:39,375
All the vehicles will be stopped.
They won't be able to leave.

2044
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:42,541
I'm certain that they will have
to be there till dawn. Let's go.

2045
02:21:42,625 --> 02:21:44,166
Yes, let's go.

2046
02:22:04,208 --> 02:22:05,333
Sir, just a minute.

2047
02:22:21,125 --> 02:22:22,583
-Beat him up!
-Hey!

2048
02:22:22,708 --> 02:22:23,791
-Hey!
-Hit him!

2049
02:22:23,875 --> 02:22:26,166
-Beat him up!
-Hey!

2050
02:22:26,333 --> 02:22:28,708
-Throw him on the side!
-Hey!

2051
02:22:30,208 --> 02:22:31,333
Who are you all?

2052
02:22:31,416 --> 02:22:33,500
-Hey!
-That's a railway gate.

2053
02:22:37,458 --> 02:22:40,708
Buddy, you be there.
I'll let you know if I see them.

2054
02:22:40,916 --> 02:22:44,000
-Parthy, they're coming.
-I'm not able to find them!

2055
02:22:44,083 --> 02:22:46,541
Parthy, I've spotted them!
They're here!

2056
02:22:46,750 --> 02:22:50,708
-Parthy, be careful.
-Where are you all?

2057
02:22:50,791 --> 02:22:54,208
-Hey, Parthy!
-Let me go.

2058
02:22:54,916 --> 02:22:56,916
Stop being adamant!
Come with me.

2059
02:22:57,708 --> 02:23:00,416
Hey, Parthy! You go there.
We will handle it here.

2060
02:23:06,708 --> 02:23:08,583
-How dare you!
-Who are they?

2061
02:23:09,416 --> 02:23:10,583
-Hey!
-Die!

2062
02:23:11,041 --> 02:23:13,208
Go! I will bring Naachiya.

2063
02:23:13,708 --> 02:23:16,000
Go quickly.

2064
02:23:19,250 --> 02:23:20,708
Bring her.

2065
02:23:21,375 --> 02:23:22,250
Come on!

2066
02:23:38,041 --> 02:23:39,958
-Does it hurt?
-No.

2067
02:23:43,833 --> 02:23:46,000
Why is your father so impatient?

2068
02:23:46,291 --> 02:23:48,458
First, tell me what
you've planned for your dad.

2069
02:23:50,041 --> 02:23:52,166
We'll take him with us to Chennai.

2070
02:23:52,666 --> 02:23:54,833
He can travel to other places.

2071
02:23:55,833 --> 02:23:57,125
That's his destiny.

2072
02:23:58,500 --> 02:24:00,791
He can never come back to this place.

2073
02:24:13,166 --> 02:24:14,708
Why is it crowded?

2074
02:24:14,791 --> 02:24:16,791
It looks like an accident.

2075
02:24:17,166 --> 02:24:19,291
It's a hearse.
Your dad was in that van.

2076
02:24:19,375 --> 02:24:21,250
-Stop the car.
-It's your dad.

2077
02:24:22,375 --> 02:24:24,458
-Parthy!
-Hold on!

2078
02:24:24,541 --> 02:24:28,125
-Parthy!
-Let me go!

2079
02:24:28,208 --> 02:24:31,958
<i>I hated you</i>

2080
02:24:33,125 --> 02:24:36,833
<i>I always went against you</i>

2081
02:24:37,833 --> 02:24:42,458
<i>-But now that you're gone...</i>
-Sir, that's my father!

2082
02:24:42,708 --> 02:24:46,541
<i>I wonder why I broke down</i>

2083
02:24:47,458 --> 02:24:49,541
<i>I hoped</i>

2084
02:24:49,875 --> 02:24:55,625
<i>To see your good heart</i>

2085
02:24:56,958 --> 02:25:01,416
<i>Why did you fade away</i>

2086
02:25:01,541 --> 02:25:05,125
<i>When I finally realized the truth?</i>

2087
02:25:05,208 --> 02:25:06,541
Dad...

2088
02:25:06,625 --> 02:25:08,458
<i>I saw you</i>

2089
02:25:09,208 --> 02:25:10,875
Dad, I saw you.

2090
02:25:11,708 --> 02:25:14,750
The way you handled that baby goat.

2091
02:25:16,833 --> 02:25:18,833
You assisted the goat in labor.

2092
02:25:20,166 --> 02:25:22,958
I was never aware of your other side, Dad.

2093
02:25:23,666 --> 02:25:27,041
I have only seen you killing chicks.

2094
02:25:28,333 --> 02:25:30,791
But you had this side to you as well.

2095
02:25:33,291 --> 02:25:38,166
I only saw your bad side
and kept you away.

2096
02:25:40,250 --> 02:25:43,291
Oh, God... Dad!

2097
02:25:44,625 --> 02:25:48,458
I could have saved you.

2098
02:25:49,083 --> 02:25:52,458
I lost you when I was very
close to understanding you, Dad.

2099
02:25:53,375 --> 02:25:57,541
Dad, please open your eyes
and look at me.

2100
02:25:58,791 --> 02:26:02,166
Please open your eyes
and look at me.

2101
02:26:03,583 --> 02:26:05,833
I am shedding tears for you!

2102
02:26:08,041 --> 02:26:09,583
Can you hear me?

2103
02:26:10,458 --> 02:26:14,583
Can you see
that I'm shedding tears for you?

2104
02:26:16,375 --> 02:26:19,750
Can you see me?

2105
02:26:20,416 --> 02:26:24,208
Please look at your son
shedding tears for you!

2106
02:26:25,291 --> 02:26:29,250
Please look at your son
shedding tears for you!

2107
02:26:31,625 --> 02:26:32,666
This is enough!

2108
02:26:34,541 --> 02:26:35,583
What else can I ask for?

2109
02:26:39,666 --> 02:26:41,250
This is enough, son.

2110
02:26:42,583 --> 02:26:45,291
You've shed tears for me.

2111
02:26:45,875 --> 02:26:47,500
I feel alive now.

2112
02:26:52,083 --> 02:26:53,208
Dad!

2113
02:27:03,375 --> 02:27:06,250
Block the vehicle.
I don't trust you. I'm on my way.

2114
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,291
-You cheat!
-You're sitting here. You!

2115
02:27:13,625 --> 02:27:14,541
Die!

2116
02:27:29,416 --> 02:27:32,541
Just die! Die!

2117
02:27:35,666 --> 02:27:37,875
Sembuli, come to me!

2118
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:49,083
Hey, was it a wig?

2119
02:27:49,541 --> 02:27:52,291
I knew it when you kept using
the word hair in every sentence.

2120
02:27:52,375 --> 02:27:55,541
Only those who don't have something
will keep talking about it.

2121
02:27:55,625 --> 02:27:59,833
-Yak, it seems! Yuck!
-I am going to finish you!

2122
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,583
Are you trying to escape?
Get inside.

2123
02:28:12,666 --> 02:28:14,500
-How dare you!
-Hey, it's me!

2124
02:28:15,875 --> 02:28:17,958
Hey!

2125
02:28:26,416 --> 02:28:28,208
Hey, open this.

2126
