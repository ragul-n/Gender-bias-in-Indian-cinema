1
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,170
- Why must we marry?
- What?

2
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,660
I mean we're engaged
so obviously we'll get married.

3
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,550
But why do we have to do it?

4
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,330
You love me, I love you, we're happy,
I mean mostly.

5
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,630
So why add a new twist
to the tale? Why?

6
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,020
Which one are you?

7
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,490
There's one 'you'
who battles in court.

8
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,350
There's another 'you'
trying to make your marriage work.

9
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,410
And this 'you' in the car with me,
hollering out of the window.

10
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,530
Out of these three,
who's the real 'you'?

11
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,610
Who knows!

12
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
The three are mixed together.

13
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,930
Boss! Two Orange Candy.

14
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,830
Sandhya-ji!

15
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,900
The photos have been digitized.

16
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,840
Really? Let's see.

17
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,020
We could get them colorised.

18
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,750
No, leave them in black and white.

19
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,390
See this photo?

20
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,690
You were in the car...

21
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,670
...surrounded by your aunties
when your father hugged me.

22
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I never told you
what he said that day.

23
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,020
Did he threaten you?
"You'd better look after my daughter."

24
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,530
No. He cried and said:

25
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,810
"If she does anything wrong,
forgive her."

26
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,640
You've never done anything wrong.

27
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,510
Except boiling the tea too long!

28
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,870
What's that?

29
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,610
My blood sugar is low today.

30
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,340
Want some?

31
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,870
Mom, you're being too picky.
He's a good man.

32
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,830
Of course he's a good man.

33
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,040
But you don't like him. We've seen
so many boys for you.

34
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,660
'Boys'?

35
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,030
OK, men.

36
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,230
You see after three years,
I'll be sixteen.

37
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,420
I want to see you settled
before that.

38
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,140
Because you'll be busy finding
a husband for yourself.

39
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,980
Of course.
Then you'll end up all alone.

40
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,970
Why did you marry me?

41
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,190
You never talk to me lovingly,
or even sit near me.

42
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,840
I take care of your home,
tolerate your mother's tantrums.

43
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,250
I cook for other people,
then cook for you.

44
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,800
You beat me and then I sleep.
So how can we have a child?

45
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,020
You keep saying your mother's
a better cook...

46
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,820
...so get her to cook.

47
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,980
If you need a woman,
go to a whorehouse.

48
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,780
Get off!

49
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,330
Now walk home!

50
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,530
Sitting on my head and barking.

51
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,790
I'll give you some love tonight.

52
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,060
"You don't love me."
I'll show you what love is.

53
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,970
Fool!

54
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,390
Maybe you can't have a kid.

55
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,040
Our time is over.

56
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,240
Our stolen moments.

57
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,240
It's not stealing.

58
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,920
We have the right to be happy.

59
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,940
Are we cheating on that?

60
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,160
Don't know.

61
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,840
We're allowed an hour of happiness.

62
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,210
Just driving around town.

63
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,570
- Eating your stupid Orange Candy.
- Don't call it stupid.

64
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,050
Don't call them stolen moments.

65
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,300
Good night.

66
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,600
"The Slap"

67
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,710
Amu, your internet's not working.

68
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,450
Everything that's on the blink
is mine obviously.

69
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,580
Sit up straight!

70
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,610
Two guys on the committee
are against me.

71
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,890
The boss has asked his daughter,
Miranda, to join in.

72
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,740
I don't know her.

73
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,030
Everything depends on the
presentation tomorrow.

74
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,820
Amu, your printer isn't working again.

75
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,500
Why don't you get it fixed?

76
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,990
I don't know about
your presentation...

77
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,080
...but I'm emotionally in London.

78
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,520
I'm busy decorating the house
with the blue door.

79
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,600
- Let me concentrate.
- Amu, please. The printer.

80
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,420
Yes, sir.

81
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,300
Subodh's here.

82
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,450
I told him to call, not ring the doorbell.
He'll wake Mummy.

83
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,790
- Hello!
- How are you, Amrita?

84
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,800
Just beautiful.

85
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,370
- Where did you disappear to?
- Ask Vikram.

86
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,830
- He's made me his slave.
- It's Subodh, Mummy.

87
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,010
Go to sleep.
They'll be at it all night.

88
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,830
Here's the history of 28
lending banks, boss. Check them.

89
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,200
- My printer's working now.
- Thanks.

90
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,330
- How's Deepika?
- She's fine.

91
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,760
I'm getting you two married
this year.

92
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,210
Why? Don't you like
seeing me happy?

93
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,630
You'll be happier
when you're married.

94
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,290
- Some coffee?
- Yes. Two cups, please.

95
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,040
Amu, could you get me
the pink file? It's upstairs.

96
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,540
Pink? That reminds me,
Pinky Chatterjee called.

97
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,000
She's getting married.

98
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,540
So she found someone?

99
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,190
I emailed you a soft copy.

100
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,170
Four anna nights,
twelve anna days

101
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,760
I save them all in a piggybank

102
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,390
The sun rises and sets in my eyes

103
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,780
I feel brightness surround me

104
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,740
In my small world,
this is how I am

105
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,690
This is the way I am

106
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,460
I'm just me, just me

107
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,980
Good morning.

108
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,020
Morning. You're up!

109
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,930
Your light was on
till late last night.

110
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,780
I have a Skype call with
an international client on Thursdays.

111
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,380
- I've got a meeting today.
- With Sania?

112
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,570
- Is her dance piece ready?
- Almost.

113
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,560
I love dancing with Sania.
She's really good.

114
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,420
She loves you.

115
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,870
You take my blood every day.
If I die, I'll die in my sleep.

116
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,400
Your sugar level agrees.

117
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,030
You fought with your husband
on the phone.

118
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,650
When I should've fought, I didn't.
No use now.

119
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,030
I ran the house, the children
are settled. My work's done.

120
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,030
- Did Vikram get any sleep?
- Yes, mother-in-law.

121
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,820
Good morning.

122
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,670
Good morning.

123
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,570
Get up.

124
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,530
I know you haven't slept much, but...

125
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,610
Well? Will I kill it?

126
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,150
Yes. But just don't look desperate.

127
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,530
Don't make them think you're dying to
work in London. To hell with it!

128
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,820
Besides, you don't look good desperate.

129
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,360
Is that so?

130
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,910
Come on, get up.

131
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,750
Amu, switch the water heater on.

132
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,550
Namaste, Sunita.

133
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,260
Madam, my life is ruined.

134
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,230
What's new now, Sunita?

135
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,420
Namaste, Mummy-ji.

136
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,040
My husband kept me awake.

137
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,990
He kept fighting with me.

138
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,640
He took me to the doctor
and asked him:

139
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,230
"What's wrong with her?
Why can't she have a child?"

140
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,800
There may be something wrong with him.
But would he ever check?

141
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,790
Then he dumped me
in the middle of the road.

142
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,080
As soon as I got home,
he started hitting me.

143
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,700
Then?

144
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,530
I ran out of the house
and I locked him inside.

145
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,910
Then?

146
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,910
He was locked in all night.

147
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,210
When I unlocked the door,
he was asleep, clutching his bum.

148
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,520
- Do you lock him in every day?
- I can't. He's a man, he grabs me.

149
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,000
And when he does, he hits me hard.
But I'm smart.

150
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,760
If he slaps me, I scream.
The neighbors stop him.

151
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,230
You little actress!

152
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,410
Amu, ask Shivani to stop that noise.
Tell her to wait till I'm gone.

153
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,280
- Hi, ma. Good morning.
- Come, have your breakfast.

154
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,710
- What's wrong?
- What is it?

155
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,330
Let her make breakfast.

156
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,610
Mama, please, you make the parathas.

157
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,910
Why experiment today?

158
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,080
I was trying to make parathas
like your Mom.

159
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,750
Sunita, get some ice.
Where does it hurt?

160
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,820
Hello? Hi, sir.

161
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,360
Yes, sir. I'll be there.

162
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,820
- They've asked me to come early.
- Does he always call the shots?

163
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,800
He owns the company.
OK. I'm off. Bye.

164
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,100
- Eat before you go.
- No time.

165
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,070
Have something.

166
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,280
- Have a bite.
- Amu, please. I'm late.

167
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,620
Your files.

168
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,640
- Thank you.
- Your lunchbox.

169
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,900
Bye.

170
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,360
- One more bite.
- Enough.

171
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,190
- Take it with you.
- Amu, please. I'm late.

172
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,940
- OK. Fine.
- Bye.

173
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,760
Mummy, I'm going to Sania's for her
dance practice.

174
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,620
Sunita, call me if you need anything.

175
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,930
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,890
I just spoke to Rajhans Jetley.

177
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,450
Miranda has chosen a white guy.

178
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,590
Jason Burbanks.

179
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,100
But she's happy to look
at your presentation.

180
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,140
That damn Rajhans is keen
on a white guy too.

181
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,680
- Move.
- Calm down, boss.

182
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,840
Why do they let women drive?

183
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,860
Good job.

184
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,130
Hampstead's a good area, aunty.
It's expensive.

185
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,120
They would choose a posh area.

186
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,010
You know what a foodie Vikram is.

187
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,660
I'm sure you can't hire a cook there.
They must be too costly.

188
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,630
Doesn't Mummy look cute?

189
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,490
What's this?

190
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,820
Look. Your prints are ready.

191
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,500
Never seen this one before.

192
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,940
- You shouldn't have given up dancing.
- Where's the time now, Papa?

193
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,600
You were very good.

194
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,860
You would've gone places.

195
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,810
Gone places? I'm heading to
London as it is.

196
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,060
Who is Mummy talking to?

197
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,150
Your Jalandhar uncle.
His daughter-in-law lives in London.

198
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,470
Tell me something...

199
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,500
...are there any Indian stores
in London?

200
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,310
She's spent her life
making other people happy.

201
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,390
Making kachori for Vikram.
Tehri for me and pasta for Karan.

202
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,460
Where's Amu?

203
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,720
Amu, Meenu was saying...

204
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,870
...there's a place in London
called Southall.

205
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,700
An alley leads straight
from there to Amritsar.

206
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,830
You're so foolish, Mummy!

207
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,020
You people have made me foolish!

208
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,390
Some people are happy
by making others happy.

209
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,270
Mothers don't have a choice.

210
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,680
They should save some happiness
for themselves.

211
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,360
If you're unhappy, you stop
feeling happy for others.

212
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,800
Sis! You didn't tell me
you were coming.

213
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,070
- Hi.
- How are you?

214
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,340
- I'm beautiful. How are you?
- Good, good.

215
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,950
- How was Vikram's presentation?
- It's finally over.

216
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,900
He'll know their decision tomorrow.

217
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,510
I know he'll make it. He's good.
Didn't you go to Bangalore, Swati?

218
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,250
I did. But I ran back.

219
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,900
Everyone was talking non-stop about
our wedding. The date, the venue...

220
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,190
- I got sick and tired of it.
- Swati's here!

221
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,270
No one will believe me...

222
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,040
...this morning still half asleep,
I soaked some kidney beans for Swati.

223
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,790
Then I remembered
she was in Bangalore.

224
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,810
Lo and behold!
A mother's intuition for you!

225
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,360
- How cute!
- Let's eat. I'll make the rotis.

226
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,000
When's your mother coming back here?

227
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,600
Amu thinks she should
stay with us...

228
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,810
...till our London plans are fixed.
If that's OK with you, father?

229
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,110
Vikram, you have a home
and your own company...

230
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,460
...so why work for others
and live in a company house?

231
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,170
Your brother Viraj wants you back.

232
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,600
The investors and the bank
are keen on expanding.

233
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,100
It's too late.

234
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
What do you mean, Vikram?

235
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,810
We couldn't expand before
but we can now.

236
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,680
Is that a reason to leave home?

237
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,120
The food's delicious, sister-in-law.
Please teach Amu how to cook.

238
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,080
- Did you see her jacket?
- Never mind.

239
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,710
Namaste, father-in-law.

240
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,010
- I hear the presentation went well.
- It went very well.

241
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,260
Tomorrow's the final meeting
then we'll know.

242
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,300
One minute, don't go.

243
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,510
Here's a sugar-free cake.
Sulakshana can have it.

244
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,970
Take it.

245
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,960
No one believes me...

246
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:39,580
...but write the board members' names on
slips of paper. Keep them in your pocket.

247
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,410
I'm telling you, it works.

248
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,450
- Amu, make sure you do it.
- We're off, Mummy.

249
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,620
You're so cute.

250
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,820
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, Papa. The same ole ache.

251
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,110
OK. Bye.

252
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,710
- Put the cake in the fridge.
- Of course.

253
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,750
I started off by saying...

254
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,030
...I don't want the job!
Appoint your white guy.

255
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,490
I surprised them by doing the unexpected.
Then came my presentation.

256
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,620
Even Rajhans clapped.

257
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,330
You should've been there.

258
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,820
What's come over you, Amu?
Wait till we get home.

259
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,910
- I'm feeling sleepy.
- I'm not at all sleepy.

260
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,910
When you're happy,
your blood sugar is OK.

261
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,330
This blood sugar will kill me
some day.

262
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,710
Why so negative?

263
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,960
I'll make breakfast today.
Just tell me what to do.

264
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,250
Come on, get up.

265
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Why can't I cook well?

266
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,330
Please teach me. Otherwise
what will I do in London?

267
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,500
How come you're such
a good cook?

268
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,350
I had to endure
years of nagging first.

269
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,810
Sometimes it was my husband.
Or my mother-in-law.

270
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,170
My father-in-law never said
a word.

271
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,080
Good morning!

272
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,500
Get up! Quick.

273
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:36,330
You never hear the alarm.
Come on, get up!

274
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,990
Good morning.

275
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,600
- What time's the meeting?
- 10:30.

276
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,160
- What time will you call me?
- 10:45.

277
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,840
Wallet.

278
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,620
- Mother's slips of paper.
- You crazy?

279
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,740
What difference will it make?
Keep them.

280
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,230
- Did Shivani buy a new car?
- Yes.

281
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,280
What work does she do?

282
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,140
Hard work.

283
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,170
Can I learn to drive too?

284
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,130
First make parathas
without burning your fingers.

285
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,400
- Good morning.
- Hi.

286
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,820
Make sure your hands are like this
when you turn. Start again.

287
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,150
- Mummy-ji, there's a call.
- You take it.

288
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,490
Hello?

289
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,160
Yes?

290
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,990
OK.

291
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,440
What is it? Tell me!

292
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,950
We're off to London! But...

293
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,530
Your son's having a party tonight
for 40 guests.

294
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,190
But we're off to London!

295
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,920
Get me a visa too.

296
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,460
Congrats!
You deserve it.

297
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,820
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

298
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,160
Vikram...

299
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,970
Rajhans Jetley is here.

300
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:54,770
Sir.

301
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,030
Man of the hour! Congrats!

302
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,490
Thank you so much.
Amu!

303
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,700
- How are you?
- All good.

304
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,870
Amu...

305
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,820
My wife, Amrita.

306
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,730
Rajhans, our CFO.
I've mentioned him to you before.

307
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,870
- Will you have something?
- In a minute.

308
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,320
- Excuse me.
- Sir, will you...

309
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,790
Hi, Subodh.

310
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,230
- I didn't know you smoked.
- You're not supposed to know.

311
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,130
- Does Karan know?
- We kiss sometimes.

312
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,210
Hi, sir. Where are you?

313
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,940
No easy way to do this.

314
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,690
Burbanks has been appointed
the London head.

315
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,670
You'll be the CEO,
but working under him.

316
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,670
Sir, must I work under
a new appointee?

317
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,050
Vikram, you have a choice.

318
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,870
Your position is secure here.
Stay in India.

319
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,390
It's not fair, sir.
This wasn't on the cards.

320
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:18,000
Vikram, the chairman feels
you won't attract enough investors.

321
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,600
- The others agree.
- Who else was at the meeting?

322
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,470
That's not important.

323
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,360
Sir, did you know?

324
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,280
Thapar called?

325
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,540
It's obvious, man.
Let's have a drink.

326
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,150
- What's obvious?
- Everybody knows, Vikram.

327
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,410
If you were smart, you would've
understood it yourself.

328
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,770
Sir, I'm not a smart man.
You're the smart one. So you tell me.

329
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,880
Chill, man!
It's just corporate politics.

330
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,250
Corporate politics?

331
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,450
I'm talking.

332
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,130
Is this is your game?
Corporate politics?

333
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,240
Why play corporate politics
with you?

334
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,500
- I'm your well-wisher, man.
- I'm not your man.

335
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,330
Thapar said everyone agreed.

336
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,560
- Who was at the meeting?
- My opinion...

337
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,750
F*** off!

338
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,790
The chairman had his daughter
overrule the decision.

339
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,440
- It's done.
- You voted against me?

340
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,790
Can't you see I'm talking?

341
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,310
You voted against me
'cos you're jealous.

342
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,890
I'll be going to London.
You'll be stuck here. Yeah?

343
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,560
You need to behave yourself.

344
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,850
- Let me get you a drink.
- Get lost!

345
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,900
You don't know me.

346
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,910
- You're crossing the line.
- What line?

347
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,920
The lines have been crossed.
Amu, one second!

348
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,770
Who the f*** are you?
Amu, wait.

349
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,000
Who the f*** are you?

350
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,010
The chairman didn't think you
were up to the job. That's who you are!

351
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,390
I hear Vikram received a call.

352
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,590
- It made him very upset. So...
- So?

353
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,270
Let's go. There are guests outside.

354
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,000
What will they think?

355
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,760
Amrita, it's a family matter.

356
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,150
They cheated him, Papa.

357
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,800
He was made to believe
he'd be the London head.

358
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,140
Thapar calls him during
the party and says sorry.

359
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,200
"You'll work under a white guy."

360
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,410
- You can't be serious.
- I'm serious. They actually...

361
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,850
Mama...

362
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,900
...did Dad ever hit you?

363
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,760
No.

364
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,220
Your Dad never raised
a hand against me.

365
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,900
- Why are you staring at me?
- I'm not.

366
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,020
- Not staring?
- No.

367
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,340
Just looking.

368
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,080
You're not the only man who hits his wife.
I cursed you for no reason.

369
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,270
You cursed me?

370
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,340
Why did you hit me?

371
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,320
Why?

372
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,860
Do I need a license to hit you?

373
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:39,850
Now run!

374
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:48,420
Mr Rohit! Please turn this way.
One photo, please.

375
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,610
It was a great show.

376
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,220
You know when I was
about sixteen...

377
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,290
...I used to go with my Dad
to public events.

378
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,960
When people photographed him,
I wondered what I was doing there.

379
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,780
People were there to see him,
to photograph him.

380
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,780
I wonder sometimes what I'm doing
with you.

381
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:53,480
With only five years' experience,
you have the top cases. Why?

382
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,330
It's privilege.

383
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,340
Because you're Justice Jaisingh's
daughter-in-law.

384
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,070
And you're Rohit Jaisingh's wife.
My wife.

385
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,740
Use this privilege and you'll be
successful like me.

386
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,260
Netra...

387
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,940
I don't know why you're fighting.

388
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,400
Hello, Manoj.

389
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,350
My friend, it's impossible
for me to come today.

390
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,000
Didn't you sleep?

391
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,770
You should've waited for Sunita.

392
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,060
Did Vikram sleep well?

393
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,730
Did you talk to him?

394
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,110
Good morning.

395
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,750
Today's a holiday. Why don't you two
go and see Maharaj-ji?

396
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,210
Tell him about London.

397
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,220
Sunita, get me the pills.
I have a fever.

398
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,410
Amu, Thapar called last night.

399
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,060
They want me to work under
a white guy.

400
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,900
And that Rajhans Jetley...

401
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,350
You came in between us.
You were pulling me away.

402
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,430
I took my anger out on you.

403
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,190
Amu...

404
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,150
Amu.

405
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,420
What will people think of me?

406
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,640
I've slogged for three years.

407
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,070
That's a lot of time.

408
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,180
Forget the hard work.
There's the emotional investment too.

409
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,360
I used to think of this company
like my own.

410
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,560
Then I realized no one values me.

411
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,320
This is ridiculous.

412
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,550
Amu, I'm quitting.

413
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,610
I cannot stay in a job
where I'm not valued.

414
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,270
Shall I oil your hair?

415
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,390
Let's watch "Dance India".

416
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,100
This poor girl has no mother.

417
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,310
Her father taught her dancing.

418
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,990
My husband hit me again
last night.

419
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:41,730
But I didn't run away.
I thought to myself...

420
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,150
...if he locks me out some day,
where will I go?

421
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,430
Let's wait. If you have another fever
we'll get a blood test done.

422
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,220
What can he eat?

423
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:12,080
Anything. If there's any problem,
call me.

424
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,850
Namaste.

425
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,010
Thank you for coming.

426
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,630
I'll see myself out.

427
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,430
Why do you get so upset
over nothing?

428
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,310
Things happen between couples.

429
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:30,040
What has a fever got to do with
Amu's problems, ma?

430
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,330
It's an old story.

431
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,630
If Amu had a stomach ache,
he would get a fever.

432
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,610
They're overreacting.

433
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,940
- Where are you going?
- To make tea.

434
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:40,750
Let me.

435
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,510
Never mind.
You boil the tea too long.

436
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,320
Bless you.

437
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,840
Please rest.

438
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,670
Sandhya-ji, please phone Amu.

439
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,400
Never mind.

440
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,420
- Bye, Mom. I'm off.
- Where to?

441
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,750
You know, Mom. Cycling.

442
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,880
Untie your 'ghungroo',
your dancing bells.

443
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,450
Bye, aunty. Bye, Mom.

444
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,060
She cycles a lot these days.

445
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,700
Yes, I've seen him.

446
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,530
He's cute.

447
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,250
Have tea before you go.

448
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,600
I've made some pakoras.
Want some?

449
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,590
No. Tea's enough.

450
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,430
Why didn't you remarry?

451
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:10,650
James spoilt me before he left.

452
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,740
Forming relationships can be easy...

453
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,970
...sustaining them is tough.

454
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,860
Everything seemed effortless
with him.

455
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,200
I could be wrong...

456
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:32,410
...but everyone seems
to need to make an effort.

457
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:42,200
Come here.
I want to give you a hug.

458
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:58,280
His fever has come down.
Where is he?

459
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,800
Amu is on the line.

460
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,280
Yes, my child?

461
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:14,230
No! They're just panicking.
I don't have a fever.

462
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:18,480
We're built strong.

463
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,940
Are you OK?

464
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,980
You stay well.

465
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,360
See you soon.

466
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:34,990
OK, bye.

467
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,400
She said, "Don't worry".

468
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,160
How can we not worry?

469
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,940
Did you know he hits her?

470
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,240
Maybe it was the first time.

471
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,040
You can't even admit to yourself
that he hit her.

472
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,550
But he did.

473
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,400
Imagine how she's feeling.

474
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,300
They're sensible.

475
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,050
They'll work it out.

476
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,390
- Good morning.
- Hi. Good morning.

477
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,730
Shall we eat out tonight?

478
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,500
My meeting will be over at 8.
I'll pick you up at 9.

479
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,480
Bye.

480
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,980
You're my everything

481
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,100
You're my happiness

482
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,760
You're my love,
you're my passion

483
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:43,450
Thapar found out I was talking
to another company...

484
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,000
...so he wants to meet.

485
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,770
Amu, I tell you...

486
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,620
...you have to put your
bloody foot down in life.

487
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,430
Give us a smile, Amu.

488
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,340
- Good morning.
- Hi. Good morning.

489
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:28,940
When we broke apart...

490
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,130
...so little was left

491
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:38,080
A fragment of sunlight...

492
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,460
...filled with dewdrops

493
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,170
Amu...

494
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:01,880
Amu!

495
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:11,670
What's this?

496
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,420
I'm going to Papa's
for a few days.

497
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:19,650
Why?

498
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,080
For how long?

499
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,920
I'll be back.

500
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,120
You'll be back? Meaning?

501
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,870
I don't know, Vikram.

502
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,620
Really, wow!

503
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:50,290
You know how bad I feel.
You know what I'm going through.

504
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,250
It's just for a few days.

505
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,250
I don't feel right here.

506
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,450
'Feel right?' What do I tell mother?

507
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:04,780
She knows.

508
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,750
My taxi's here.

509
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,710
Amu, hold this.
This is not the time.

510
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,670
- Forget it.
- I understand, Vikram.

511
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,250
But I need this.

512
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:32,120
Fine. If you want to make this
into a big deal then go!

513
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:54,700
- Did something happen again?
- Must she justify coming here?

514
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:00,650
That's her home. I want to know
why she's here.

515
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:04,940
Ma, I want to spend some time
with you.

516
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,100
That's all very well, child.
But...

517
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,370
Sis, the party was days ago.

518
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,850
We thought you would've both
worked it out by now.

519
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,570
We tried. We're trying.

520
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:22,720
- What do you mean?
- I need more time.

521
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,710
Child, don't leave your home...

522
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,990
Sandhya-ji, you won't believe it.

523
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:32,250
When I came home from my walk...

524
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:34,350
...I saw a potato curry on the fire...

525
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:40,090
...and thought there was no chance
Amu was here, but here she is!

526
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,790
A father's instinct for you!

527
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,050
What are you waiting for?
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

528
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:52,060
When we broke apart...

529
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:56,160
...so little was left

530
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,930
A fragment of sunlight...

531
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,140
...filled with dewdrops

532
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,350
We were tied together
with a single thread...

533
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:14,100
...that came slowly undone

534
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:18,320
Our names were written on the wall...

535
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:22,960
...now washed away by the rain

536
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,640
When we broke apart...

537
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,980
...so little was left

538
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,640
A fragment of sunlight...

539
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:40,110
...filled with dewdrops

540
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,570
Are shattered dreams...

541
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,610
...worth living for?

542
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,780
Are false promises...

543
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,720
...worth chasing?

544
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:17,850
I made my mind up...

545
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,060
...to find myself again

546
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:28,100
I must now follow my heart

547
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,760
The road we traveled...

548
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,340
...seems so narrow now

549
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:45,020
A fragment of sunlight...

550
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,550
...filled with dewdrops

551
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,820
Papa-ji, try and make her understand.

552
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,340
It wasn't such a big deal.

553
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,030
A big deal, Vikram?

554
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,530
You know how upset I was.

555
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:30,940
Then half the wives in India would
leave home for something so trivial.

556
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:33,690
Half? Many more than half.

557
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,810
What can I do, Papa-ji?
It's done now.

558
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,840
It's done?

559
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,950
Vikram, the important question
is why it happened.

560
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,080
Why? I mean Thapar phoned...

561
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,790
Vikram! You didn't tell us
you were coming.

562
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,380
Have dinner before you go.

563
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,680
- I'll get it ready.
- Don't trouble yourself.

564
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,880
The cupboard's not opening,
can you help? Come.

565
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,500
- Give it to me.
- I can manage.

566
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,860
You look lovely.

567
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,660
Here.

568
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,060
I came to take you home.

569
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,770
Not yet, Vikram.

570
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,480
Amu, this is too much!

571
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:16,840
Why are you so angry?

572
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,560
- Let's end it!
- What should I end?

573
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:26,410
This fight. Let's go home.

574
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,080
We didn't fight.

575
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:31,800
Didn't you leave home?

576
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:35,200
What do I tell the neighbors?
Or our relatives?

577
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,030
"My wife has left me and run away."

578
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,590
- Why did your wife run away?
- Not again!

579
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:44,430
I told you. I was drunk,
irritated, frustrated.

580
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:47,070
If you don't understand
my problems, who will?

581
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,340
Who'll understand my problems?

582
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:53,980
- Who is it all for?
- Who am I doing it all for?

583
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:55,800
You leaving your home...

584
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,170
...and getting upset.
Is this what you're doing?

585
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:02,230
- Is that all I've done?
- Did I ask you for anything?

586
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,110
Did I impose any conditions
on you?

587
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,350
Before we married, you said
you didn't know how to cook.

588
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:11,240
Me? A foodie! Did I complain?

589
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:17,020
What if I had said, "I'll love you
but I don't know how to earn a living."

590
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,380
Would you have married me?

591
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,280
And if I had said, "I'll earn the money,
you learn how to cook."

592
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:26,680
- Would you have married me?
- It was just a moment.

593
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,110
It'll never happen again.

594
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,780
Who knows?
But it happened once.

595
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,840
And if I can't forget?

596
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,570
Amu, what do you...

597
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:40,850
What do you want?

598
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:44,960
Tell you what. Hit me.
Try it.

599
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,760
Why don't you slap me
then we'll be even? Go on.

600
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,550
It did cross my mind
to get even that way.

601
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,190
But I couldn't do it.

602
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:01,210
My parents didn't bring me up
like that.

603
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,550
Come again? Now you want
to discuss our upbringing?

604
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,910
Amu, that's going really far.

605
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:13,860
My parents didn't ask for your hand.

606
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:20,120
Family honor matters to us. Wives don't
leave their husbands like this.

607
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:22,920
We know how to keep
our families together.

608
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,590
And I'll do whatever it takes
to do so.

609
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:35,430
Has Vikram left?

610
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:37,890
Amu...

611
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:58,280
Take care.

612
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,410
This is an historical victory
in a sexual harassment case...

613
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:17,680
...for the fearless lawyer Netra Jaisingh,
a great advocate of women's rights.

614
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,190
Let me read the entire judgement.
Thank you.

615
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:42,860
Chef, replacement's on the fryer.
Plates out. Going on call.

616
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,830
Hi. Did you see me?

617
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,140
Yeah. Of course I was watching.

618
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,480
Live on TV.

619
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,290
I was so proud of you.

620
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,980
You know it was absolutely commendable
the way you handled yourself.

621
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,920
When you stepped out,
I could see the confidence in your walk.

622
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,140
The victory in your smile.

623
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,060
I'm so happy for you.

624
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,310
You know I felt so good.

625
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:14,000
Even in the middle of that chaos
I could feel the wind on my face...

626
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,820
...as though I was looking out
of a car window...

627
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,120
...and flying.

628
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:21,740
Thanks to you.

629
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:25,750
Any time. Be happy.
Keep flying.

630
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,330
Hi. Good morning.

631
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,710
Kapoors have been pushed to 5pm.
Raghuvanshi's petition has been filed.

632
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,420
Amrita, Netra.
Netra, Amrita.

633
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:45,250
Hi, Amrita. Give me five minutes.

634
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,490
State of India vs. Shagun Verma.

635
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,850
I won!

636
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:04,140
Everyone says your daughter-in-law
is your worthy junior.

637
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,640
Thank you, father-in-law.

638
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,680
Section 9.
Restitution of conjugal rights.

639
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:18,250
A legal notice ordering you
to go home.

640
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:23,830
I don't want to.

641
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,210
Why not?

642
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,740
Don't feel like it.

643
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:33,050
Unfortunately, not feeling like it
doesn't work in court.

644
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:36,450
One slap cannot be the only reason.
What's the real story? His family?

645
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:38,960
No.

646
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:40,910
Was he having an affair?

647
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,040
No.

648
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,910
- You're having an affair?
- No.

649
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:44,990
Sexual?

650
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:47,780
No.

651
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,620
So, just one slap then?

652
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:57,610
That's unusual, Amrita. People may
think you're unreasonable.

653
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:01,770
Don't those people think slapping
is unreasonable?

654
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,370
Maybe. But your reaction could
seem unreasonable.

655
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:09,350
I can't respect myself any more.

656
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:14,810
I chose to be a housewife.
No one forced me.

657
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:16,760
I'm not complaining.

658
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:21,070
I was happy to be a part of his dreams.
And his life.

659
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:23,970
But, along the way...

660
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:28,440
...I might have become
the kind of person someone slaps.

661
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:32,680
Isn't that unreasonable?

662
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,010
He cannot hit me.

663
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:43,500
"Just a slap?"
He cannot slap me.

664
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:46,090
What do you want?

665
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,650
I want to be happy.

666
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:53,130
So when I say I'm happy,
I would not be lying.

667
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,550
You have three options.

668
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,780
The first and easiest, go back.
Make it work. That would be my advice.

669
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,510
Or you have legal options.
Judicial separation.

670
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,520
You'll remain his wife, but you won't
live with him.

671
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:11,260
Or divorce.

672
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:16,390
But the legal options can get
very messy, Amrita.

673
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:20,440
So we lie to ourselves
and say we're happy.

674
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:23,390
I don't want to lie.

675
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:26,460
To him or to myself.

676
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,060
Think it over.

677
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,730
Things are not what they seem

678
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,220
Relationships are hard to sustain

679
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:05,630
May no one break my heart

680
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,900
May no one turn their back on me

681
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:14,270
May no one abandon me

682
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:19,550
Life is long

683
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,880
Living is hard

684
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,710
Time does not pass
without my beloved

685
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,260
O Lord, my heart knows no peace

686
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,840
Without my beloved...

687
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,950
...all is darkness

688
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:59,270
O Lord, my heart knows no peace

689
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:43,160
You shouldn't have introduced Amu
to your boss, Netra.

690
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,980
Karan, she was served a legal letter.

691
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,300
They were fine.

692
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,930
Nice life, nice home.

693
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:56,770
Swati, it was one small episode.

694
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:00,210
I know it shouldn't have happened
but this is silly.

695
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,820
It was the first time.

696
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,120
Right.

697
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,120
Tell me something, Karan...

698
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,500
...if I cheated on you
for the first time...

699
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:08,830
...would you forget it?

700
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,790
- Or if you cheated on me?
- You're overreacting.

701
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,750
- Cheating is simply immoral.
- Exactly.

702
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,290
Should we make a list of
what's immoral and what's not?

703
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:30,880
I never thought we'd see the day
a daughter of ours gets divorced.

704
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,670
Where did we go wrong?

705
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:39,410
We raised her, educated her...

706
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,380
...married her into a good family.

707
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,990
Now it's her responsibility.
It's her home. So look after it.

708
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:54,660
Women have to learn tolerance
to keep the family together.

709
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:57,990
- One has to suppress one's feelings.
- There's no need.

710
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,760
Did you ever have to?

711
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:03,160
Of course I did.

712
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:06,500
Didn't I have desires?

713
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:12,430
I wanted Amu to become
a dancer like Sitara Devi.

714
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:16,790
My father wanted me to sing on
All India Radio.

715
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:20,920
But I had to compromise.

716
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:26,160
Should I have looked after
the house and kids? Or sing songs?

717
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,540
Sandhya-ji...

718
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:40,810
...did I ever stop you?

719
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,480
So what if you didn't? Don't I have
a mind of my own?

720
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:47,710
Didn't I know what was important?

721
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,630
Who told you what was important?

722
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,480
My mother said
a home is more important.

723
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:58,060
Her mother taught her
a home is all important.

724
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:05,390
Didn't you know?

725
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:10,640
Did you ever ask, "Sandhya, why don't
you sing anymore?"

726
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,870
You knew people would gossip...

727
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,940
..if I had sung after marriage.

728
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:29,970
I didn't say a word,
but you let it pass too.

729
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:35,670
I suppressed my feelings.

730
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:45,380
He was wrong to hit you
but he can't take it back.

731
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,340
So, what do you think
I should do?

732
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:50,980
You should give him a chance.

733
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:55,960
Imagine how embarrassed he already is,
at home and in the office.

734
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,560
Everyone's problems are important
except Amu's.

735
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:02,190
Amu has much more to lose.

736
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,270
Men can remarry easily.

737
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:06,580
But she'll have
the tag of a divorcee.

738
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,360
I don't get you.

739
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,310
I'm on her side.

740
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,950
Do me a favor. Swati, please
don't get involved.

741
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,990
My sister's marriage is breaking.

742
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,370
So who'll fix it? Amu?
He's sending her legal notices.

743
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:23,240
It's like I'm talking to a stranger.

744
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,390
I'm gonna go now.

745
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,090
You know what? That's a great idea.
You should go.

746
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:32,340
Her life's at stake. And you and your
Netra are fighting the case. Please leave.

747
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,530
- Please leave.
- Enough, Karan!

748
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,450
Let go.

749
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:42,010
Get out.
Say sorry to her.

750
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,280
Say sorry at once. Or leave
this house now. Go!

751
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:50,620
Swati, I'm really sorry.

752
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:07,820
Good night, Mummy.

753
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:11,290
Papa, I'm not...

754
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:14,020
It's not about me.
It's for everyone's good.

755
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,180
I'm saying this for Amu's sake.

756
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,440
Ma, I swear to you...

757
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,310
Talk to Swati, not to me.

758
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,700
They're blind.

759
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:48,330
When I was watching you on TV,
I thought Salve had lost on purpose.

760
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:53,210
Salve is overrated.

761
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:03,020
I'm proud of you.

762
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:06,770
You're looking beautiful.

763
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,430
When I saw you on TV,
I was reminded of Dad.

764
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:13,550
Whenever he won a big case...

765
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:16,460
...he would look down
and walk away...

766
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,700
...as if it was no big deal.

767
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:22,460
Big man.

768
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,980
Look at you walk.
Your smile.

769
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:30,160
There's victory in your eyes.

770
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:35,800
It's OK.

771
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:39,030
Success does different things
to different people.

772
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:44,220
Come here.

773
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,320
Come.

774
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,610
I'll make myself a drink.

775
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,210
Let's celebrate.

776
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,710
Rohit, you're drunk and I'm tired.

777
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,580
Please.

778
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,660
You're so beautiful.

779
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:19,080
You never even thanked me.

780
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:24,160
Remember who introduced you
to Shagun Verma?

781
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:28,190
I texted you as soon
as I got into the car.

782
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,290
A text?

783
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:38,180
Who thanks anyone with a text?
Only strangers do that.

784
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:41,980
But now I'm here...

785
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:46,400
- ...you can thank me properly.
- Rohit, I can't.

786
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,960
I tell you what...

787
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,500
...you just stand here. Relax.

788
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,200
Let me enjoy your gratitude.

789
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:22,950
Are you deaf?
Can't you see I'm eating?

790
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,610
Deaf idiot! Do you need
your ears to eat?

791
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:31,170
I'm watching TV. That's it.
So shut up.

792
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:35,620
Let him come home. He'll fix you!

793
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,130
- Are you deaf?
- No, you're the one who's deaf.

794
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,470
You wanna watch TV? Deaf idiot!

795
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,230
Sunita!

796
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,560
Sunita.

797
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:23,860
- Mummy.
- Yes?

798
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,360
Why are you making the tea?
Where's Sunita?

799
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:31,070
Her husband beat her badly,
she couldn't come to work today.

800
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,530
Isn't it your prayer time?

801
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,950
- Let me make the tea.
- No, you go!

802
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,860
- Let me.
- I'll do it.

803
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:56,650
Mummy, where are the tea leaves?

804
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:00,260
They're finished. You'll have to open
a new packet.

805
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,200
- Found it?
- Yes.

806
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:18,160
"Urgent action will make the consequences
of global warming manageable.

807
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:21,330
"What is at stake is the half
of ecosystem, wildlife...

808
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:24,780
"...and importantly, the world
we leave for our children."

809
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,540
Father-in-law, get well.

810
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:46,750
I need to talk to you.

811
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:55,440
We're filing for a divorce...

812
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,490
...on the grounds of irreconcilable
differences.

813
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:01,400
Amrita, I'm a lawyer
but I'm also a woman.

814
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:05,280
Are you sure about this?

815
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:10,050
Taking this path could be
very difficult for you.

816
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:13,380
Think it over again.

817
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:17,420
Every relationship is flawed.
One has to mend it.

818
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:22,540
If you have to mend it,
it means it's broken.

819
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:27,550
What shall I do? Pretend?

820
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:30,740
For how long?

821
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:37,330
I'll soon become resentful
and start hating him.

822
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:42,500
Netra, I've loved him for so long.

823
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:49,590
It's not entirely his fault,
it's mine too.

824
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,990
I let it happen.

825
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,850
It's also my mother's fault...

826
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,680
...for bringing me up this way.

827
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,700
Vikram's mother is to blame too.

828
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:07,630
What would you do in my shoes?

829
01:20:10,970 --> 01:20:12,380
I'd forgive him.

830
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:16,390
So am I wrong?

831
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:22,070
No.

832
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:27,330
Does she have a real case
for divorce?

833
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:32,090
When you're truly in love,
I mean truly in love...

834
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,760
...a little physical aggression
is an expression of love.

835
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:39,140
He slapped her once
and she wants a divorce.

836
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:42,220
There's nothing here, Viraj.

837
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:45,220
No claims, no allegations.

838
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:51,060
She wants a divorce by mutual consent,
on grounds of irreconcilable differences.

839
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:56,700
If you both want a divorce,
then this letter is sufficient.

840
01:20:57,970 --> 01:20:59,820
But if you don't want to divorce...

841
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:02,670
...as a lawyer, my advice would be
don't go to court.

842
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,640
Try and finish this off.

843
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:07,010
Otherwise it can get long drawn.

844
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:12,150
Thankfully there's no mention
of domestic violence.

845
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,350
Domestic violence, sir?

846
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:19,190
I was there.
She was the one pulling him.

847
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,210
Try and understand what I'm saying.

848
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:26,460
I'm trying to explain.

849
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:29,830
If she decides to press charges
of domestic violence...

850
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,670
...it becomes a police case.

851
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:35,060
Then it gets complicated.
Long drawn.

852
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:37,340
Talk to her.

853
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,450
Persuade her. Threaten her.
Talk to her.

854
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:43,330
What happens in court?
We're the ones who talk...

855
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:45,700
...on your behalf.

856
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:48,750
Things get ugly in court.

857
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:51,460
So talk to her, OK?

858
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:56,460
Viraj, how's she affording Netra?

859
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,860
She seems to have some connection
with Netra's assistant.

860
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:00,960
OK.

861
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,030
So we need to be prepared.

862
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:05,680
In case she files charges
of domestic violence...

863
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:10,650
...you'll need witnesses who'll testify
nothing happened at the party.

864
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:13,440
- Buy them.
- OK.

865
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:18,030
Also, the police will have the power
to arrest Vikram.

866
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:20,570
Don't worry. I'm there.

867
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,120
Namaste, Mummy-ji.

868
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,730
I'm here.

869
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,400
Mummy-ji, will you eat in your room
or out here?

870
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:53,870
Mummy-ji, why won't you answer?

871
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:04,310
Mummy-ji.

872
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:21,070
Mummy-ji is upstairs.
I'll clean Vikram sir's room.

873
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:29,050
Amu ma'am will scold me.

874
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:43,430
Mummy-ji!

875
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:16,710
Ma'am, it's me.
Come home at once.

876
01:24:21,770 --> 01:24:23,980
Her blood sugar has dropped.

877
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:31,700
If Amrita had called me even
ten minutes later...

878
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:42,740
You know what a coma is,
Mrs Sabharwal?

879
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:46,050
Is that what you want?

880
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,800
Amrita, you'll have to be strict.

881
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:11,340
OK?

882
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:17,750
I've written up a prescription.
Please get the medicine.

883
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,000
She's fine. Nothing to worry about.

884
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:25,410
Thank you.

885
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,880
I'm right outside.

886
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:07,540
What are you doing, ma?

887
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:21,290
I'll talk to her.

888
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,260
Go and talk to her.

889
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:04,430
Come home with me.

890
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,040
I won't leave Vikram here alone.

891
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:15,700
It makes no difference if I die.

892
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:18,040
- What are you saying?
- Am I wrong?

893
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:21,710
What will change for you?

894
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,560
Morning golf? Evening billiards?

895
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,100
Now the servants cook your meals.

896
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,230
I'll come every day till you're well.

897
01:27:46,890 --> 01:27:50,090
I'll stay till you return from work.

898
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:56,760
Shall we go?

899
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,150
Bless you.

900
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:17,260
You're divorcing me?

901
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:29,550
Amu, it's not too late.

902
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:31,670
Come back home.

903
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:38,780
How amazing! You think
everything is fine.

904
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,150
I think things are dreadful.

905
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:45,380
Clearly we see life very differently.

906
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,320
S*** happens, Amu.

907
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:51,090
It happens.

908
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,090
People move on.

909
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:59,520
You were so emotionally invested
in your company, you could not move on.

910
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:02,780
I invested my whole life in you.

911
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:06,120
How can I move on?

912
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:09,200
I can't do it.

913
01:29:13,730 --> 01:29:15,810
I don't love you.

914
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,330
He refuses mutual consent.

915
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:28,580
We'll have to go to court.

916
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:32,670
Read the petition details.
Then we'll get it ready.

917
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:37,080
Netra, this is all wrong.

918
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:41,220
Maintenance? 50% of the property?
I don't want anything.

919
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:44,000
- It all belongs to him.
- Really, Amu?

920
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:47,790
Who looked after the house?
Who looked after him?

921
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:51,380
From morning tea to dinner?

922
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:54,000
Is he in a good or bad mood?

923
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:56,330
Let him sleep.
He has an early flight.

924
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:57,790
Who did all that?

925
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:02,170
Your life is invested
in everything he has.

926
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,330
Amu, you could've had
your own career.

927
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:09,420
It might've been worth more than 50%.
Didn't you give it all up?

928
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:14,150
- Swati, that was my choice.
- You have no investments.

929
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:17,360
Will you start again
from scratch?

930
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,720
It wasn't some deal, Netra.
It was love.

931
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,720
All marriages are deals, Amrita.

932
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:27,340
A contract between two people.

933
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:30,090
Love is not mandatory
in marriage.

934
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:34,320
You can love without being married.

935
01:30:35,090 --> 01:30:38,490
Do you think all marriages
run on love?

936
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,380
It's an unfair deal. You get some
sense of dignity and security.

937
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,020
That's why you're here.

938
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:49,320
Allow me to get you a fair deal,
in your favor.

939
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:55,700
We had a fair deal. He earned money
and I looked after the house.

940
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:59,590
What's unfair is the slap.

941
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,960
What's unfair is the expectation
that I should move on.

942
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:10,170
What's unfair is all my options
are messy and unpleasant.

943
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:15,880
What's unfair is even you
advise me to accept the unfair.

944
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:19,560
Maybe it's because you haven't
experienced the unfair.

945
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:29,290
Everyone says, "It's just a slap".
Know what that slap did?

946
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:34,860
Suddenly I became aware
of all the unfair things...

947
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:37,390
...I had learned to accept.

948
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:42,500
What's expected of me is that
I move on from the unfair.

949
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:48,550
That slap took me back
to the Amrita in college.

950
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,930
The Amrita who wanted only
two things in life...

951
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:55,120
...respect and happiness.

952
01:31:57,820 --> 01:31:59,290
You know what?

953
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,100
That's all this Amrita wants too.

954
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,460
- How are you, Shankar?
- All good.

955
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,860
My regular. Same for him.

956
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:01,980
- Netra, it's 5am.
- Sorry. I got you up so early.

957
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:06,980
- Must be special?
- It is.

958
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:11,480
I felt like revisiting my past.

959
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,770
The old days seem so far off now.

960
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,110
This was the college hangout.

961
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:23,940
We made so many plans here.

962
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,850
It's never too late.

963
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,320
Who knows
why I'm telling you this?

964
01:33:34,970 --> 01:33:36,430
I know why.

965
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,200
I remind you of Rohit.

966
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:42,970
The Rohit you fell in love with.

967
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:48,450
If you find that Rohit again
I'll be out of your life.

968
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:54,060
And I'm OK to play the part
for as long as you want.

969
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,560
Thanks for meeting me.

970
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:16,060
Let it go, child.

971
01:34:17,790 --> 01:34:20,460
Women must learn to be tolerant.

972
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,210
Are you happy...

973
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:29,180
...being tolerant?

974
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,480
My sons are happy.

975
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:33,920
So is my husband.

976
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:39,370
We women don't matter.
Our happiness is in their happiness.

977
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:48,970
Papa, I must finish some work.
I'll join you soon.

978
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:52,160
I'll see you at Gujral's office.

979
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:54,210
Shall I pick you up?

980
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,750
I need something from the cupboard.
May I?

981
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:02,760
I'll call you in five.

982
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:05,240
Come.

983
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:09,350
What is it?

984
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:12,000
I need something
from the cupboard.

985
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,350
What do you need?

986
01:35:18,690 --> 01:35:20,100
You want all this?

987
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,750
That's yours.

988
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:25,870
All these clothes belong to you.

989
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,200
It's all yours.

990
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:31,320
What doesn't belong to you?

991
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:34,290
Go on, tell me.

992
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,810
Here are your files.

993
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:41,280
Your lawyer sent me a letter.

994
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,590
A sweet letter. You want it?
Or shall I keep it?

995
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:47,760
What should I do?
I'll keep it.

996
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:50,560
The alarm clock belongs to you.

997
01:35:52,650 --> 01:35:54,060
Take it.

998
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:57,430
I'm getting late for work.
I'm off.

999
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,270
Bye. Thanks.

1000
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:04,890
By the way, what's this drama
you've created?

1001
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:11,820
You want to prove to everyone
how sweet and responsible you are.

1002
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,140
But you're not that sweet.

1003
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,290
You've been fooling the world.

1004
01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:23,110
You want a divorce,
I'll give you a divorce.

1005
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:26,890
Amrita, you've turned my life
upside down.

1006
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:29,300
I'll give you a divorce.

1007
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,160
Vikram has replied.

1008
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:46,490
I've emailed it to you.
Can you read it now? I'll hold.

1009
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:50,110
Sure. Papa, may I use your computer?

1010
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:54,030
Are you reading it?

1011
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:54,960
Yes.

1012
01:36:55,170 --> 01:36:59,320
They say you want a divorce because
Vikram is not going to London.

1013
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:02,740
And you're making
the slap an excuse.

1014
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:06,450
Apparently when he left his
father's home and business...

1015
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:08,570
...you tormented him.

1016
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:10,560
You wanted to share his wealth.

1017
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:16,800
He says you married him because
you were eyeing his family property.

1018
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:20,740
You were physically
violent at the party.

1019
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:23,820
You were drunk and dragged him
into the bedroom.

1020
01:37:24,390 --> 01:37:28,490
Vikram says he tried to free his hand,
that's when you got hit.

1021
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,520
Everyone saw it happen.

1022
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:35,070
Amu, your bank account's frozen.

1023
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:37,160
Even your credit card is blocked.

1024
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:40,790
Amrita, I assume their statements
are all lies, right?

1025
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:43,450
And you wanted to play fair.

1026
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:46,710
Now you see how low they'll stoop.

1027
01:37:47,410 --> 01:37:50,980
He'll force witnesses to say
he didn't hit you.

1028
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:55,660
They'll say you were drunk
and you misbehaved that night.

1029
01:37:55,930 --> 01:38:00,220
That you're a manic depressive,
and sometimes get out of control, etc.

1030
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:03,200
I told you this is not going
to be easy.

1031
01:38:03,730 --> 01:38:06,800
If it was that easy, half the marriages
would end in divorce.

1032
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:10,130
You still want to play fair?

1033
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,080
Yes.

1034
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:19,630
It's not about them.
It's about me.

1035
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:26,530
Let him do what he wants.
I'll do what I believe is right.

1036
01:38:27,070 --> 01:38:29,490
Even that has repercussions.

1037
01:38:29,610 --> 01:38:31,600
Even doing wrong has repercussions.

1038
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:34,930
He hit me.

1039
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,470
For the first time. But he can't.

1040
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:39,880
He can't hit me even once.

1041
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:42,560
End of story.

1042
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:45,130
That's what my petition is about.

1043
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,040
Vikram, listen...

1044
01:39:04,690 --> 01:39:06,410
They're s*** scared.

1045
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:09,320
They're in a board meeting.

1046
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:12,080
Don't ask who told me.

1047
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:15,830
But everyone knows you're planning
on quitting.

1048
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:20,100
Thapar told Miranda, "We cannot
let Vikram go. He's indispensable".

1049
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:23,960
And you won't believe it,
even Rajhans fought for you.

1050
01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:27,060
He said: "Vikram deserves
the London job".

1051
01:39:29,410 --> 01:39:32,650
Brother! Miranda is going to call you.

1052
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,720
- Now be happy.
- I am happy.

1053
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:39,410
London!

1054
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:43,050
You're back?

1055
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:59,020
Is Amu here? I heard her voice.

1056
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:00,970
Maybe she's in the bathroom.

1057
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,670
I'll be back in an hour.

1058
01:40:05,890 --> 01:40:07,350
We'll talk later.

1059
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:27,760
Bless you, child.

1060
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,210
Are you alright?

1061
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:37,720
I'm fine. How are you?

1062
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:40,270
Beautiful.

1063
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:43,470
- Is Vikram in?
- Upstairs. He just came home.

1064
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:51,950
Vikram.

1065
01:41:01,050 --> 01:41:03,980
I did a pregnancy test at home.

1066
01:41:05,010 --> 01:41:06,410
It's been two months.

1067
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:12,020
I'm pregnant.

1068
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,780
You're...

1069
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,050
...pregnant?

1070
01:41:25,230 --> 01:41:28,440
With so much going on,
I didn't realize...

1071
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,770
Where's your smile?

1072
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:33,110
We're having a baby!

1073
01:41:35,310 --> 01:41:38,730
This is the most wonderful day.
I've just quit smoking too.

1074
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,910
Miranda has agreed to all my conditions.
We're going to London.

1075
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:45,150
I'm going to be the boss
like I always wanted to be.

1076
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:48,890
It's perfect! Everything is working out.
Remember this?

1077
01:41:49,820 --> 01:41:52,860
I wrote my life goals in my diary.

1078
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:56,530
2020, we go to the UK.
2020, father.

1079
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:58,150
2022, father again.

1080
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:00,210
2025, we shift to America.

1081
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:03,170
Amu.

1082
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:14,790
Amu, think about the baby
at least.

1083
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:26,930
You can't do this.

1084
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,890
I didn't do this.

1085
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:33,810
Will you ruin your child's life
out of stubbornness?

1086
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:37,060
If I stayed, I'd ruin three lives.
Mine, yours and the child's.

1087
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:42,550
The only reason I'd stay
is if I loved you.

1088
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:45,630
And I don't. I told you.

1089
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:52,400
This child is yours and mine.
That's the way it'll be.

1090
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:57,860
You can't decide alone.

1091
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:00,760
You decided what you had to.

1092
01:43:01,470 --> 01:43:03,800
Go wherever you want. Go.

1093
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:07,600
But I won't let you take
my child with you.

1094
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:10,010
Get it? I promise that.

1095
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:22,940
It doesn't have to be like this.

1096
01:43:37,730 --> 01:43:38,940
Sandhya-ji...

1097
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:43,480
...you know our daughter
is going to be a mother.

1098
01:43:48,020 --> 01:43:52,350
Such happy news!
You're going to be a grandmother.

1099
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:57,810
How can I be happy?
This isn't happy news.

1100
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:04,810
Maybe the circumstances are sad.
But can't we celebrate?

1101
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:11,060
When you were carrying Amu,
my mother said:

1102
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,100
"Keep Sandhya happy.

1103
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:19,230
"If the mother is happy,
the child will be born happy."

1104
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:26,770
For nine months
I didn't argue with you even once.

1105
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:30,500
Good night.

1106
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:38,100
Sandhya-ji...

1107
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,530
...we must keep our daughter happy.

1108
01:44:50,170 --> 01:44:51,880
Your Papa wasn't always like this.

1109
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,630
When I was a newly-wed...

1110
01:44:56,810 --> 01:45:00,500
...he would recite
revolutionary poetry to me.

1111
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:04,300
Our Mussoorie honeymoon
was spent listening...

1112
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:07,440
...to the revolutionary poet's
Ramdhari Singh Dinkar's verse.

1113
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:09,030
Remind me.

1114
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:13,910
"The battle is not over,
the hunter alone is not to blame.

1115
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,830
"Those who stand by and watch...

1116
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:21,840
"The crimes of bystanders
will be remembered by history."

1117
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:29,800
When I was pregnant with you,
his mood changed.

1118
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:34,230
He turned from a revolutionary
into a true romantic.

1119
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:36,840
Sweetheart...

1120
01:45:39,820 --> 01:45:44,480
...if the mother is happy,
the child will be born happy.

1121
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:50,280
- Sandhya-ji, your tea's getting cold.
- Pass it to me.

1122
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:54,120
Papa...

1123
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:58,520
Am I making a mistake?

1124
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:07,280
We only do what we think is right.
You'll know later if you're wrong.

1125
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:11,920
This isn't just a whim, is it?

1126
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:17,800
Is this what you truly want?

1127
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,190
Sure?

1128
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:26,270
Thought it over carefully?

1129
01:46:30,910 --> 01:46:32,980
Then you're doing the right thing.

1130
01:46:34,450 --> 01:46:37,950
Doing the right thing
doesn't always end in happiness.

1131
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:41,940
OK?

1132
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,360
Drink your tea.

1133
01:47:12,490 --> 01:47:13,720
Come, madam.

1134
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:28,850
You've done what you had to.

1135
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,420
Now he'll handle the rest.

1136
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:34,830
You want a legal battle?

1137
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:36,940
What do you mean?

1138
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,240
She has my child.

1139
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:41,980
You're leaving for London.
She isn't.

1140
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:44,540
She has nothing to lose.
You do.

1141
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:46,990
- Do you want that?
- So, what do I do?

1142
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,920
Abandon my child and go?

1143
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,930
Just because I slapped her once.

1144
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:56,360
Calm down. Relax, brother.

1145
01:48:01,490 --> 01:48:04,210
This is too much.
Do everything you can.

1146
01:48:04,630 --> 01:48:08,420
She can't afford to fight the case.
I know the family. Be aggressive.

1147
01:48:08,630 --> 01:48:11,620
Bring them down to the negotiating table
and then offer them a deal.

1148
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,310
No child in our family
will end up an orphan.

1149
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:22,160
Let her go. Her loss.

1150
01:48:36,370 --> 01:48:38,230
- Sunita.
- Yes, sir.

1151
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:42,830
Your wages.

1152
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:55,120
Sir, you've given me too much.

1153
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:58,120
This is your wage from now on.

1154
01:49:00,610 --> 01:49:01,930
Keep it.

1155
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:05,490
Clear the table.

1156
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:12,240
Let me know if madam rings.

1157
01:49:24,660 --> 01:49:26,470
I really didn't see anything.

1158
01:49:27,890 --> 01:49:29,940
Unfortunately Sania did.

1159
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:37,600
I don't know what's come over her.

1160
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:41,130
I'm doing everything I can
to get her back, Shivani.

1161
01:49:44,890 --> 01:49:46,560
I might need your help.

1162
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:48,840
I know I'm asking a lot but...

1163
01:49:50,670 --> 01:49:52,530
...I might need you to say...

1164
01:49:53,450 --> 01:49:55,540
...that nothing happened at the party.

1165
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:08,580
You know what, Vikram?

1166
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,830
I was married to a wonderful man.

1167
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:16,950
I would like to believe men
are wonderful people.

1168
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:25,910
So I prefer to pretend I didn't hear
what you just said.

1169
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:49,980
Netra, my client has agreed
to the divorce.

1170
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:57,010
He's proposing to give his
Noida apartment to your client.

1171
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:00,180
We're also ready to discuss alimony.

1172
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:04,410
But my client wants full and complete
custody of the child.

1173
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:09,920
During pregnancy she'll have to stay
at her father-in-law's house.

1174
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:12,180
After all, it's Vikram's first child.

1175
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:17,010
Either you've forgotten or misunderstand,
but this is not a custody battle.

1176
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:20,260
My client is seeking a divorce
from your client on mutual consent.

1177
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:23,700
Domestic violence charges have not
been filed or mentioned.

1178
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:26,120
Netra, I'm offering you this deal...

1179
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:28,340
...because neither of us
want to go to court.

1180
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:30,870
You and I know how ugly
it gets in court.

1181
01:51:30,990 --> 01:51:32,580
We don't want that. Do we?

1182
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:37,340
We have an eyewitness testimony.
Someone willing to testify...

1183
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:40,260
...that no violence took place
at the party.

1184
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:44,020
We could go to court,
but we don't want to.

1185
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:49,490
You know how inflated
petitions can get.

1186
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:53,070
As though you had left anything out
in the present one.

1187
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:56,400
Look at her. Has she ever
tortured your mother?

1188
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,730
I insist you don't talk
to my client directly, Netra.

1189
01:51:59,150 --> 01:52:01,810
Can your client look at my client
and tell me...

1190
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:06,280
...when he was at work,
didn't she, from morning to night...

1191
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,750
...look after everything?

1192
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:12,460
Didn't she run the house?
A house that's in his sole name.

1193
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:16,110
You want to save your marriage?
But in his petition...

1194
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:19,940
...he says his mother almost fell
into a coma due to her negligence.

1195
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:21,990
I'm warning you,
I'll terminate this session.

1196
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:24,550
Does he know the difference between
fasting sugar and PP sugar?

1197
01:52:25,150 --> 01:52:27,490
Know how much blood sugar
levels fluctuate?

1198
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:29,400
You are not obligated
to respond to this.

1199
01:52:29,570 --> 01:52:31,610
No, of course he's not.
Men rarely are, right?

1200
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,910
You're attacking my client.
Please stop this.

1201
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:36,310
No, Mr Gujral,
you are attacking my client.

1202
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,240
I'm done now and so are you.

1203
01:52:38,930 --> 01:52:39,990
You'll be hearing from us.

1204
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,290
Mrs Sabharwal...

1205
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:45,340
...you've read our petition
and we've read yours.

1206
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:47,680
This can go on for years.

1207
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:51,530
Vikram is being kind enough
to discuss a settlement.

1208
01:52:51,930 --> 01:52:54,880
You can have what you want
and so can we. That's it.

1209
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:01,970
Amrita, I've known you for years.

1210
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:07,110
I'm sorry to say this,
but you need better legal advice.

1211
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:12,190
She doesn't know when she turned
from lawyer to activist.

1212
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:16,320
She didn't turn from lawyer
to activist...

1213
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:19,360
...she turned from a lawyer into a woman.
Of course, that's not right.

1214
01:53:27,370 --> 01:53:28,470
Now?

1215
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:32,550
Now nothing.

1216
01:53:33,630 --> 01:53:37,140
Look, she was never going
to take this deal.

1217
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:41,250
But now she knows getting
a divorce isn't easy.

1218
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:45,090
She's going to come back.
Wait and watch.

1219
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,620
They're not going to agree.

1220
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,620
Netra, I can't lie.

1221
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:54,040
He slapped you. Is that a lie?

1222
01:53:54,330 --> 01:53:55,460
It isn't, is it?

1223
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:58,370
Let me charge him with
domestic violence.

1224
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:02,770
Or they'll say you're a manic depressive,
a drunk and insane. They'll prove it all.

1225
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:05,420
You'll be fighting the case
for the rest of your life.

1226
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:08,290
Thank you, Mr Gujral.
Thank you so much.

1227
01:54:19,470 --> 01:54:21,370
Do you seriously want to do this?

1228
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:28,100
Mother has organized a prayer meeting
for our baby.

1229
01:54:28,990 --> 01:54:31,620
She's praying she'll hold
her grandchild in her arms.

1230
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:34,330
She's waiting for you.

1231
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:36,400
For her grandchild.

1232
01:54:38,250 --> 01:54:41,040
We can still move to London.
To Hampstead.

1233
01:54:41,890 --> 01:54:44,650
The house with a blue door.
Everything will be fine.

1234
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:46,120
Really?

1235
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:50,330
You really think everything
will be fine?

1236
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:55,570
If I'd seen this side of you before,
I'd never have loved you.

1237
01:54:56,170 --> 01:54:58,820
But thanks for convincing me.

1238
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,290
I have no plans to deny your mother
of her grandchild.

1239
01:55:04,790 --> 01:55:07,260
Netra and I did not even suggest it.

1240
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:12,990
Though you did suggest
buying this child from me.

1241
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:16,370
But I'm sorry.
It's not for sale.

1242
01:55:16,830 --> 01:55:17,970
Really sorry.

1243
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,580
And tell Mummy-ji,
I'll be at the prayer meeting.

1244
01:55:25,890 --> 01:55:29,380
And in your next petition you can say
I'm a drunk and a manic depressive.

1245
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,520
Your petition's incomplete.

1246
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:33,310
You can do better.

1247
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:49,340
I didn't hear your last words to him.

1248
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:52,150
The rest was pitch perfect!

1249
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:16,210
- Vikram, come in.
- Sir.

1250
01:56:19,420 --> 01:56:22,210
- Happy?
- It's what I wanted.

1251
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:24,970
Sir, I want to say thank you.

1252
01:56:25,090 --> 01:56:28,090
Subodh told me how hard
you fought for me.

1253
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:31,300
You thought I was against you.

1254
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:33,390
I was just telling you the truth.

1255
01:56:35,710 --> 01:56:36,850
Sir, I'm...

1256
01:56:39,090 --> 01:56:41,860
- I'm sorry about that party night.
- That's OK.

1257
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:45,360
Subodh filled me in.
Sorry to hear about the home front.

1258
01:56:47,970 --> 01:56:49,040
Sit down.

1259
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,870
- Can I say something? Don't mind.
- No, sir.

1260
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:57,430
It was your fault, Vikram.

1261
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:01,200
You don't hit your wife.
It's not done.

1262
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:04,910
You were furious with me and Thapar.

1263
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:06,910
But would you hit us?

1264
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:10,150
And for whatever it's worth...

1265
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,590
I think you should've given
her more time.

1266
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:14,710
She must've been hurt.

1267
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,400
Why didn't you wait a few days?

1268
01:57:18,370 --> 01:57:20,890
You and I are running
some sort of strange race.

1269
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:24,600
We have to win.
Improve our timing.

1270
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,450
Then break a world record.

1271
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:30,770
But our family isn't running
in that race.

1272
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:34,530
This is not good.

1273
01:57:35,110 --> 01:57:36,860
Exactly what I feared.

1274
01:57:38,030 --> 01:57:41,940
They've filed 498A and Section 354
in the magistrate's court.

1275
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:43,070
Meaning?

1276
01:57:43,190 --> 01:57:46,400
Domestic violence and outraging
a woman's modesty.

1277
01:57:46,870 --> 01:57:48,940
It's a police case.
They can arrest you.

1278
01:57:49,170 --> 01:57:52,440
- But I didn't outrage...
- Yes. You did!

1279
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:57,570
Take it.
Amrita has sent an MoU.

1280
01:57:57,950 --> 01:58:03,710
Agree to a divorce by mutual consent,
then they'll withdraw the police case.

1281
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:08,400
She doesn't want anything.
Only joint custody of the child.

1282
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:11,770
So it's either this or court.

1283
01:58:18,970 --> 01:58:20,270
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1284
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:21,820
All signed and good to go?

1285
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:25,420
Where's Amrita?
I will speak to her.

1286
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:26,940
She'll be at the prayer meeting.

1287
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:31,070
And if I may speak
to your client directly?

1288
01:58:31,390 --> 01:58:33,350
Sign. It's the best deal.

1289
01:58:34,430 --> 01:58:35,430
Threatening me?

1290
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:37,520
No. Legal advice.

1291
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:40,430
You need better legal advice.

1292
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:10,280
Bless you.

1293
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:19,980
Don't eat anything sweet.

1294
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:23,560
Tell someone to check your
blood sugar every day.

1295
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:27,220
You're not that old.
You have a lot to live for.

1296
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:29,050
Take care of yourself.

1297
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:32,400
You make such delicious food.

1298
01:59:33,060 --> 01:59:36,020
Start a cookery school.
There are many like me who can't cook.

1299
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,630
You'll be busy.

1300
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:39,880
Teach everyone...

1301
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:43,600
...the way to a man's heart
is through his belly!

1302
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:53,920
You arranged such a grand wedding
for us.

1303
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:58,300
When I played in the park nearby,
I'd stare at Vikram from afar.

1304
02:00:00,050 --> 02:00:02,930
I never thought I'd marry
into such a rich family.

1305
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:07,090
In fact, I never thought
I would ever marry.

1306
02:00:10,610 --> 02:00:13,410
Everyone asked what I wanted
to be when I grew up.

1307
02:00:13,530 --> 02:00:18,100
I don't remember saying
I wanted to be a housewife.

1308
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:25,720
I don't know how my mother came to you
with a marriage proposal.

1309
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:28,010
And how Vikram agreed.

1310
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:31,870
I didn't even know
how to make parathas.

1311
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,100
I don't know why Vikram accepted.

1312
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:38,670
Then I thought I may not be
the best dancer...

1313
02:00:38,790 --> 02:00:42,640
...but I can become the
world's best housewife.

1314
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:47,020
I tried very hard. I promise.

1315
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:52,800
I was so busy keeping Vikram happy...

1316
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:56,950
...I even forgot blue was not
my favorite color.

1317
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:02,320
My favorite color is yellow.
Right, Papa?

1318
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:14,000
You showered me with love.

1319
02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:22,260
But on the night of the party,
I realized you loved Vikram's wife...

1320
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,340
...not me.

1321
02:01:28,010 --> 02:01:30,960
After that night
none of you came to see me.

1322
02:01:34,350 --> 02:01:37,510
No one told Vikram it was his fault.

1323
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:42,710
Everyone thought what
Vikram did was OK.

1324
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:47,220
And if it was not OK, Amu should
put it behind her.

1325
02:01:47,830 --> 02:01:49,510
She should move on.

1326
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,690
I can't forgive you for that.

1327
02:01:58,690 --> 02:02:02,540
In the circumstances, I can't live
with Vikram or any of you.

1328
02:02:06,030 --> 02:02:07,780
Vikram and I are fighting...

1329
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:10,960
...and we'll keep fighting.

1330
02:02:12,210 --> 02:02:16,410
But it was our love and our fight.

1331
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:20,420
We will love our child.

1332
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:23,600
I'll love the baby...

1333
02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:25,990
...and Vikram will love it even more.

1334
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:31,630
You'll see.

1335
02:02:34,450 --> 02:02:37,040
I'm going now.
I'll come and see you.

1336
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:01,540
It's not your fault.

1337
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:04,240
It's the fault of us mothers.

1338
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:06,660
And fathers.

1339
02:03:07,570 --> 02:03:11,560
We never taught our sons
they could not slap a woman.

1340
02:03:13,410 --> 02:03:15,150
It was your mother's fault.

1341
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:18,540
She told you to stay silent.

1342
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:23,490
We have no right to ask you to stay.

1343
02:03:25,070 --> 02:03:26,180
Go.

1344
02:03:27,990 --> 02:03:29,340
Be happy.

1345
02:03:30,620 --> 02:03:32,210
Visit me often.

1346
02:04:57,720 --> 02:04:59,030
Swati, I'm just...

1347
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,130
You deserve better.

1348
02:05:06,530 --> 02:05:09,980
I don't know how often
I've disappointed you.

1349
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:12,830
I said sorry...

1350
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:16,240
...but it had no meaning.

1351
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:20,860
I wasn't willing to hear
what my sister Amu wanted.

1352
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:24,620
And then I behaved
the same way with you.

1353
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:27,830
You were there for her when I wasn't.

1354
02:05:28,750 --> 02:05:30,450
And for that I am...

1355
02:05:31,050 --> 02:05:32,930
...so, so sorry.

1356
02:05:35,170 --> 02:05:37,080
I'm sorry for letting you down.

1357
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:39,210
I need to reboot, you know.

1358
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:42,910
I need to become someone better.
Someone who deserves you.

1359
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:54,430
Karan, I was not going to
come back from Bangalore.

1360
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:57,640
But I won't go anywhere now.

1361
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:01,600
I'm gonna be here with you.
We'll reboot together.

1362
02:06:24,330 --> 02:06:26,910
I'm leaving your father's company, Rohit.

1363
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:31,190
I'm opening a new law firm.

1364
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:33,830
No more favors from you.

1365
02:06:35,350 --> 02:06:39,430
No more privileges of being your wife
or his daughter-in-law.

1366
02:06:41,180 --> 02:06:42,630
I'm leaving, Rohit.

1367
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:51,360
I'll come and see your father
from time to time, if that's OK?

1368
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,180
Priyan...

1369
02:07:30,410 --> 02:07:32,540
...I won't be seeing you again.

1370
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:34,370
What's wrong, Netra?

1371
02:07:34,700 --> 02:07:36,020
You were right.

1372
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:38,410
Those were stolen moments.

1373
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:40,880
The time we spent together.

1374
02:07:41,710 --> 02:07:43,430
I'm starting afresh.

1375
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:48,990
I didn't want you to make
your life decisions for me.

1376
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:50,430
I don't want that.

1377
02:07:51,930 --> 02:07:54,320
I just want to be happy
in everything I do now.

1378
02:07:54,570 --> 02:07:55,700
That's all.

1379
02:07:57,680 --> 02:07:59,010
Be happy.

1380
02:08:00,260 --> 02:08:01,170
Be good.

1381
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:02,870
OK?

1382
02:08:07,870 --> 02:08:10,940
I won't go to work.
I'll look after the house.

1383
02:08:11,410 --> 02:08:14,670
You want to be a man?
I want to be a woman.

1384
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:20,440
We'll manage with your earnings.
I'll stop working.

1385
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:23,470
Don't hit me.

1386
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:26,330
Don't hit me.

1387
02:08:28,810 --> 02:08:32,330
Then go ahead, kill me.

1388
02:08:32,660 --> 02:08:34,500
Go on. Kill me.

1389
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:38,600
If you don't, I'll slit your throat
when you're asleep.

1390
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:41,120
Kill me!

1391
02:08:43,090 --> 02:08:45,790
Kill me!

1392
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:59,610
You think you're a real man.

1393
02:09:03,460 --> 02:09:04,660
Bye.

1394
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:10,280
Hello.

1395
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:17,990
I've stopped looking for a husband
for you. It's very tough.

1396
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:20,300
Good plan.

1397
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:23,630
But I've found a boy for you.

1398
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:29,340
I've been watching him.
He's nice.

1399
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:31,860
Please, Mom.

1400
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,370
My baby.

1401
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:43,740
I'm happy as I am.

1402
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:58,370
Sorry, Papa. I've ordered a sofa.

1403
02:09:58,490 --> 02:10:01,550
But they keep delaying
the delivery.

1404
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:03,680
There's no sign of them.

1405
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,500
Be careful.

1406
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:15,430
I was reciting my new poem in the college
where I taught.

1407
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:20,380
We were talking about it
when I heard you were born.

1408
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:23,670
Did you know the title of my poem?

1409
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:27,270
"Amrita." That's why we called you
"Amrita."

1410
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:32,230
Yes, I turned my veil into the sky

1411
02:10:33,670 --> 02:10:38,040
If my path strays from my desires

1412
02:10:47,710 --> 02:10:53,320
If my chest falls short of breath

1413
02:10:54,210 --> 02:10:56,490
I should have that sky of mine

1414
02:10:58,780 --> 02:11:01,400
I want to scatter myself
in every direction

1415
02:11:02,070 --> 02:11:04,760
I want you to call out for me
in every direction

1416
02:11:05,470 --> 02:11:09,380
If you find me, hold me close

1417
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:17,480
But fold my sky and return it to me

1418
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:23,000
So you have a sky of your own

1419
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:27,820
And I have a sky of my own

1420
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:36,670
Hi.

1421
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:38,760
Just check everything's in order.

1422
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:55,000
Hi.

1423
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:59,360
May I talk to you?

1424
02:12:25,090 --> 02:12:29,010
I never imagined
we'd end up in court.

1425
02:12:33,910 --> 02:12:35,780
I messed up, Amu.

1426
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:42,340
No... I'm not asking you
for anything.

1427
02:12:42,830 --> 02:12:44,510
I have no right.

1428
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,510
I had no right to slap you.

1429
02:12:52,390 --> 02:12:54,860
Why did I think I had that right?

1430
02:12:56,950 --> 02:12:59,150
No one has that right.

1431
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:02,930
And I never apologized to you, actually.

1432
02:13:05,270 --> 02:13:07,220
I never said sorry.

1433
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:14,350
When I said: "I love you",
I thought that was enough.

1434
02:13:16,110 --> 02:13:19,430
Goodness knows what I wrote
in those petitions.

1435
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:27,220
I'm sorry for it all, Amu.

1436
02:13:28,430 --> 02:13:29,770
I truly am.

1437
02:13:32,450 --> 02:13:37,350
When I entered that Hampstead house
with its blue door...

1438
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:41,770
...it didn't feel like home.

1439
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:44,330
You're my home.

1440
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:49,710
So I quit my job.

1441
02:13:51,860 --> 02:13:55,910
That house, Hampstead,
the job, everything.

1442
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:00,560
I'll start from zero.

1443
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:07,170
Next time I'll deserve you.

1444
02:14:09,130 --> 02:14:11,430
See me sometimes, my friend.

1445
02:14:20,130 --> 02:14:23,860
When we broke apart...

1446
02:14:24,540 --> 02:14:28,030
...so little was left

1447
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:32,030
A fragment of sunlight...

1448
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:36,990
...filled with dewdrops

1449
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:49,790
Are shattered dreams...

1450
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:57,910
...worth living for?

1451
02:15:00,030 --> 02:15:03,190
Are false promises...

1452
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:08,830
...worth chasing?

1453
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:15,020
I made my mind up...

1454
02:15:15,810 --> 02:15:19,300
...to find myself again

1455
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:23,660
I must now follow my heart

1456
02:15:28,910 --> 02:15:32,240
The road we traveled...

1457
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:36,410
...seems so narrow now

1458
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:41,050
A fragment of sunlight...

1459
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:45,010
...filled with dewdrops
