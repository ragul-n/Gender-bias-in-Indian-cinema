Are you sure?

4
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,084
This is the only option we have.

Don't be scared.

00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,289
Shall we ask him
where the bus is?

15
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:20,594
Keep quiet!

16
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:22,790
Varun, what's the number?

17
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,125
KL 7 AK 47.

18
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,164
Dude, it's over there.

19
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,202
Don't run.

20
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,538
Bro, this is the one.

21
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,100
This is it!

22
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,043
Gautham, pull me up.

23
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,211
Make it fast!

24
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,769
Climb up, my boy!

25
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,607
Hey, here's the hammer.

26
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,155
Push! Push!

27
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,749
Give me the bag.

29
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,634
- You wait here.
- Here. Hold this.

30
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,205
- l heard the sound overthere!

31
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,605
Gautham, ask them
to make it fast.

32
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08,708
Hey!
Hey!

33
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:09,777

00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:11,301
He woke up. Make it fast!

35
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:14,578
You guys leave! l'll
take care of this.

36
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,309
Don't pull off your
cinema-style heroism here.

37
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,943
- Come down, you schmuck!

- Come down!

00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,024
Hey, l will come with him.
You guys leave.

41
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,183
Leave. l'll come.

42
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,988
Varun, Akshay will take care of him.
Come!

43
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,086
- Then go back in.

44
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,152
Dude, the light!

45
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:33,800
Dude, the stuff!

46
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,198
Get down fast!

47
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,196
Come quickly!
- Leave. l'll come.

48
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,709
Josetta, catch him!

49
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,411
Josetta, don't leave him.

50
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:47,715
Who are you?

51
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:48,682
'Akshay.

52
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,377
An innocent guy who doesn't have the
courage to do anything by himself,

53
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,886
but will do anything if
his friends are with him!'

54
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,055
Chechi!

55
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:56,790
Molly Chechi!

56
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,158
Move!

57
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,291
What's up?
All good?

58
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:01,760
Where are you barging into?

59
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,057
For your dad's wedding!

60
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,695
Chechi, 4 meals.

61
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:05,999
200 Rupees.

62
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,102
200 Rupees?

63
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,093
Wasn't it 40 Rupees for
one meal till yesterday?

64
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,764
lf you keep raising the price,
we'll have to take loans for this.

65
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,274
'This is Kuppi. He's the most
enthusiastic one in the group.'

66
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,108
Module 5!!

67
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:19,713
lt's ready!!

68
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,872
Fresh notes!

69
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,447
Just 10 Rupees!

70
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,213
One for the silent girl.

71
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,324
l mean, one for Darshana.

72
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,194
Right?

73
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,220
'Even though he's a prankster,
his heart is pure.'

74
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,805
'This is Rockstar Gautham.'

75
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:45,965
'And his guru, Austin.'

76
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,422
What happened to him?
- l think his house was seized.

77
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,390
He might be sad about that.
Come, buy me a juice.

78
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,962
'Even though most girls in
college are behind Gautham,

79
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,155
Gautham's rockstar is Devutty.'

80
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,834
- What did you find after
opening the ballot box?

81
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,392
That's Kochi Metro.
This is Smart City.

82
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,027
We can make this happen somehow.

83
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,072
But that one.

84
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,841
l don't see any chance.

85
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,899
'Varun is furious.

86
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,112
Everyone else is scared of Varun, who's
more disciplined than soldiers;

87
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,842
and is more short-tempered
than policemen.'

88
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:30,884
Varun,

89
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,387
C++ Module 5 is out now.

90
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,450
Shall l get you a copy?
- How much is it?

91
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:42,529
lt actually costs Rs.4.
But l sell it for 10.

92
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,431
But you can have it for 4 Rupees.
That's fine.

93
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,033
- No. You can keep 10.

94
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,399
- He comes even before the bell rings.
Silly baldie!

95
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,500
lndustrial Revolution?
ls he a Communist?

96
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,333
How is lndustrial Revolution
& Communism related?

97
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,933
l.V.

98
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,307
Dude!!

99
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,806
Bro, trip!! The first
trip in our college life.

100
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,349
Your l.V. has been approved.

101
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,055
The dates are from 28th to
31st of this month.

102
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,890
Dude, 28th to 31st!

103
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,188
So the last day is new year's eve.
This will be awesome.

104
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,489
Four days.
Only South lndia.

105
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,819
You must visit at least one industry.

106
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,861
Who is the organizer
among you guys?

107
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,825
Varun!!

108
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,170
'Now the picture is clear, right?'

109
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,169
'Varun is tensed about the
planning for the l.V trip.'

110
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,076
Washington DC via Miami Beach.

111
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,306
Haven't these guys had enough of this?
What is this?

112
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:34,905
Arunachal Pradesh.
That is closeby.

113
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,413
That's Andhra Pradesh, dude!

114
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,342
Hey, it's time. Eat quickly.

115
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,349
l have to feed you all the time!

116
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,257
lsn't this mine?

117
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:44,424
How did it reach here?

118
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,984
What's wrong with Himalayas?
-Are Himalayas in South lndia?

119
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,862
lsn't it?
-And do Himalayas have industries?

120
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,930
No?

121
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,989
Can we go to Himalayas
and come back in 4 days?

122
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,433
Can't we?

123
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,201
Very nice!

124
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,904
Click over there.
There!

125
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,303
Dude, Kuppi is behind you!

126
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,403
How come you're not
interested today?

127
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,143
Usually you don't let Kuppi
anywhere near you, right?

128
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,147
For the past 3 days,
she has been absent.

129
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,451
- That's why.
- Ya right!

130
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,350
As if they are best friends!

131
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,626
Dude, it has been 3 semesters
since we joined this college.

132
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,594
And he hasn't even
spoken to her so far.

133
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,023
l never got a good chance.

134
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,131
That's why.

135
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,165
Crap!

136
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,331
l would've killed him now.

137
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,563
lt was fine if she was a
girl who shows attitude.

138
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,435
ln spite of looking so great,

139
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:36,138
she's such a sweet girl who
doesn't show any attitude.

140
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,904
Here. Take my phone. l have her number.
Just call her!

141
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,280
Message her, at least.

142
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,617
That cheap trick of getting the number
of the girl you like from somewhere

143
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,642
and keep disturbing her?

144
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,318
Well, l'm not gonna
do any of that!

145
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,421
Her number..

146
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,083
She will give it to me herself.

147
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,425
Wait & watch!

148
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,551
- Who is he talking about?
- Your dad!

149
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,360
Dude, Diya!

150
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,455
Great! Didn't he
find anyone better?

151
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,469
Dude, who are the most famous
couple in our college?

152
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,936
Boban Sir & Molly Chechi!

153
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,898
Do you know how
they got together?

154
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,208
During the first year l.V.

155
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,309
Notjust them,

156
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,506
most couples of our college
got together first during their l.Vs.

157
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,412
l'm saying this with the
experience of being your senior..

158
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,241
When you're in class,

159
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:20,187
you'll be stuck with attendance,
seminar, lab, exam..

160
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:21,654
You won't get time
for anything else.

161
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,924
But those 4-5 days
when you go on tour..

162
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:30,959
lf you're looking for a
chance to talk to Diya,

163
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,060
you won't find a better
chance than the l.V.

164
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,704
Wherever we're going, there
should be enough sights to see.

165
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,968
A fort, a palace, a museum..

166
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,009
lt should be colourful, right?

167
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,211
But it would be great if
there's a beach as well.

168
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,042
Campfire, music, sunset..

169
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,514
Crap!

170
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:51,517
lf you want all that, why don't you sit
& watch Discovery channel at home?

171
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,917
While every respectable college
gives 10-15 days for l.V,

172
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,421
our lousy college has given
us only 4 days! Just 4!

173
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,460
Dude, we should go to party spots!

174
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,427
Raves..

175
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,331
But..

176
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,326
Palace, Rave, Beach...

177
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:11,435
All of this in one place..
That's not possible!

178
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,039
That's true.

179
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,197
But if we go to two places,

180
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,577
it's possible.

181
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,046
So friends,

182
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,216
l'm here before you to
present the tour plan

183
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,514
for the first l.V in
our college life.

184
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,458
The most beautiful visuals..

185
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,228
Dude, it's us!

186
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,466
You don't want that?
Okay!

187
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,071
Well..

188
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,115
Even better visuals,

189
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,450
World famous palaces,

190
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,644
Historical forts,

191
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,378
The first destination of our l.V.

192
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,650
The capital of the
Vijayanagara empire

193
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,420
which we all know from
our History textbooks - Hampi.

194
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:11,186
- Humping?
- Not humping. Hampi!

195
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,100
Will this end up
being a pilgrimage?

196
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,692
l'm just back from
Sabarimala temple.

197
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,166
And ya,

198
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,362
we aren't going to Hampi alone.

199
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,770
After a tour of Hampi for 2
days, we go directly to..

200
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,603
lndia's party capital.

201
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:37,846
MBRHDRG

202
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:39,620
That's not possible!

203
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,759
How is Goa part of South lndia?

204
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:46,632
Technically speaking, there's no division
between North lndia & South lndia.

205
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,260
Even if it exists, Goa would still
be part of South lndia, Sir.

206
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,032
Which industry are you going
to visit in Hampi & Goa?

207
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,631
Sir, lnfosys, Cognizant,
Excelsoft, Aabasoft, L&T...

208
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,445
There are 50 such
industries in Mysore, Sir.

209
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,713
Mysore is on the way.

210
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,840
Trust me, Sir! For us
Computer Science students,

211
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,639
- this is a perfect l.V.
-Awesome!

212
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,652
How will you cover all these
places & come back in 4 days?

213
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,484
We have Christmas
holidays till the 27th.

214
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,821
We will take leave for the l.V. from
28th to 31st, and 1st is a Sunday.

215
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,657
So basically, if we take 4 days
off, we would get 6 days in total.

216
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,230
Boban Sir,

217
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:18,831
'Cute DP'

218
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,336
H.O.D. Sir,

219
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,761
is everything okay?

220
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,644
Sir, we can't send them to Goa!

221
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,201
- Don't approve it, Sir.

222
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:35,775
Shall l tell them?

223
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,843
On the last day of the l.V,
31st night,

224
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,483
to celebrate New Year's
eve, we're going to

225
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:44,751
the biggest party in lndia!

226
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,885
Sundown Party!!

227
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:57,503
Varun!

228
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,340
Varun!
- What is it, dude?

229
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,244
Wouldn't the tickets for Sundown
be sold out months in advance?

230
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:06,576
Then how are we going to arrange
it in this last minute?

231
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,876
Do you think l'll promise that
without finding some way?

232
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,746
l shall arrange the tickets.

233
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:11,784
Dude!

234
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,913
You are the man! The lightning!
The thunderstorm!

235
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,455
Unnikrishnan!

236
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:18,825
l'll be right back!

237
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,688
See how you're walking!

238
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,592
ls this how you dress?
Tuck in your shirt!

239
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:26,265
We can dress like this too!

240
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,527
What is this?
- Not what. Who!

241
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:29,569
Here!

242
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,631
Why are you hiding it?

243
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:32,897
ls your face so ugly or what?

244
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,507
Oh! This is why?

245
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,704
Go to the office, pay Rs. 1000
as fine and then enter this lab.

246
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,585
Do you have Rs.1000 on you?
As a loan?

247
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,286
You know how difficult it
is to write a love letter?

248
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:58,453
What's special today?

249
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,238
l will be the female staff who's
coming along with you for your l.V.

250
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,438
l will be the male staff accompanying
you forthe l.V. from tomorrow.

251
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,444
Move! l want one!

252
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,452
Don't take all of them!

253
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,612
All this is okay.

254
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,890
Girlfriends & boyfriends will
not be allowed to sit together.

255
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,921
There are strict orders
from the department.

256
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,431
- Phew! l'm relieved now.

257
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,628
lt's really bad that they won't
allow us to sit as couples.

258
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:35,668
Get lost man!

259
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:39,464
First, you go talk to her, and then you can
think of sitting together as a couple.

260
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,306
lf Pristu was the one
saying this, it was fine

261
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,678
Come, come closer.
l'll show you something!

262
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:47,203
lf you have any plans of
smoking & drinking, forget it.

263
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,804
l will be checking all
your bags tomorrow.

264
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,713
What do we do with all
the bottles we bought?

265
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,379
Notjust one or two bottles, but 5 litres.
That too, hard drinks.

266
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,480
lf he catches us, our l.V
will be over then & there!

267
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,293
l can think of only one option.

268
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,295
lt's a little risky!

269
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:07,700
You!

270
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:08,801
Son, you?

271
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,364
Aren't you the one who came to
book the bus the other day?

272
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,507
Yes brother.

273
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,509
This is my friend.

274
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,476
Friend?

275
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:18,704
Sir will be checking our bags.

276
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,813
So we thought we'll hide
the bottles in the bus.

277
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:23,846
-And where did you hide them?

278
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:28,287
- Below the seat where
Sir is going to sit.

279
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,688
Nice! The perfect place to
hide from yourteacher.

280
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:35,562
Under his ass!

281
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:36,961
Carry on guys!

282
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,258
Okay! Good night!

283
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,565
Hey kids!

284
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,533
My heart tells me..

285
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,870
this will be one helluva trip.

286
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:47,974
Have a blast!

287
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,269
So good night!

288
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,427
Go take bath, man!

289
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,828
'Long ago, there was a
veteran teacher in a town'

290
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:15,702
'He was very clever, but
could not draw a picture'

291
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:21,868
'That became a problem! The kids
couldn't understand anything!'

292
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:25,536
'And they failed in all their exams!'

293
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:39,922
'That fellow was hellbent
on finding a way,'

294
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:44,964
'He took his disciples
to a place far away'

295
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:49,128
'To see all that they
hadn't seen before'

296
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:54,599
'The story got reversed & they
passed in all the exams!'

297
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,114
Get lost!

298
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:38,643
'As time went by, this story
became the talk of the town'

299
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:43,382
'And gradually, it
became a routine'

300
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:48,558
'To roam around the world easily;

301
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:52,495
l.V became a synonym forthat'.

302
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:56,995
'This routine is still going on,

303
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:02,171
and here goes some more
people for the same'.

304
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:28,960
'Aanandam'
(Joy)

305
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:36,901
33..

306
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,044
34,

307
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,712
34 and a half,

308
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:40,880
36,37,38..

309
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,710
Get lost!

310
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:43,516
Dude!

311
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,711
Smile! You're my sweetheart!

312
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,452
- Did you bring the portable charger?

313
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,557
Diya?

314
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:55,962
Why isn't this getting over?

315
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,165
- There are no bottles in them, right?

316
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,100
l wanted to check your bags.

317
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,036
Why not? Please check them, Sir.

318
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,094
You can start with mine!

319
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,162
There are no bottles, Sir.

320
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,573
Such a grumpy guy!

321
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:16,111
Make it fast.

322
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,220
Has everyone boarded?

323
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,188
Everyone has boarded.

324
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:22,889
Come.

325
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,550
Let's head to Hampi.

326
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,957
One person is yet to come!

327
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,986
Who? What?

328
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:37,193
MBRHDRG

329
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,639
- What's your name?

330
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,040
- And yours?

331
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,809
What are you staring at?

332
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,310
- Did you like her?

333
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,778
- You didn't like her?.

334
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,146
So you like her?.

335
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,648
Then do one thing.

336
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:49,740
Propose to her.

337
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,621
Why are you laughing?

338
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,248
She's acting smart! So
you don't have to propose.

339
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,157
- You propose to him.

340
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:58,953
Ya!

341
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,564
Say yes, Akshay!

342
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,799
l can't live without you, Akshay!

343
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,962
Say yes, Akshay.
Please Akshay!

344
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,662
That's enough!

345
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,006
Why aren't you saying yes?

346
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,906
Say yes!

347
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,648
Say it, Akshay. Say yes!

348
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:24,350
- One second. He will say yes now.

349
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,282
Enough?

350
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,133
Where were you all this while?

351
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,376
You don't have any luggage?

352
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,809
Yes. There it is.

353
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,174
Has she run away from

Do you read the newspaper?

362
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,786
The sports page alone.

Aren't you ashamed to read & enjoy

You know what that is?

394
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,627
No!

That's the specialty
of this temple!

Dude, we'll enjoy this
view and go up slowly.

Move aside! Give way!

402
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,020
Diya?

403
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,221
What is this?

404
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,888
Or shall we go up quickly?

405
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:09,052
- We won't miss the sunrise then.

Looking at his excitement!

409
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,967
Such a loser, right?

410
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,106
Guys should have a spine!

411
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:21,707
Some sort of strength..

412
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:24,610
We should always stand straight
and never bend for anything.

413
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,475
Hey. Aren't you coming?
Come fast!

414

There's no signal at all!

What the hell are you doing there, man?

You go. l'll join you soon.

lsn't a dog's life wild?

430
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,230
Mock me!

431
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:19,522
But wait & watch!

432
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,623
One day l'll also become
a famous photographer.

433
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,428
Like Michael Schumacher!

434
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:24,469
Huh?

435
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,471
Grumpo!

436
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,637
This is why she said 'No' to you!

437
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,571
- Get lost!
- You get lost!

438
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:48,794
MBRHDRG

439
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:53,598
Dude,

441
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:57,659
She's standing right there.
Go talk!

442
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,639
Sheesh!
This guy!

443
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,038
- Shall we go there?

444
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,404
You've fallen hard for her, eh?

445
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,638
l don't know how to
make you understand.

446
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,242
Her crooked teeth,

447
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:11,517
croaky voice,

448
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:14,008
how she comes to class
without even taking a bath..

449
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,781
With every imperfection
of hers that l see,

450
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,156
l find herto be even
more perfect!

451
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:22,489
When everyone else talk about her
looks, dressing sense and hairstyle,

452
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,118
l've never looked at all that.

453
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,627
Then what do you look at?

454
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:27,299
Sheesh!

455
00:29:29,702 --> 00:29:32,193
Dude, what is she going to do
to you; to be so scared of her?

456
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,796
Not her, l'm scared of
what l'm going to do.

457
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:38,267
You guys are her friends. Your
girlfriend is her best friend.

458
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:41,342
lf l propose to her and she says 'No',

459
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,272
everything will be spoiled, right?

460
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:46,180
Right now she is at least
smiling at me when she sees me.

461
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:47,816
lf that's also gone...

462
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,382
We have three years left.

463
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:50,817
How will l face her?

464
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:54,784
All this is if she
says 'No', right?

465
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,593
What if she says 'Yes'?

466
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:00,298
Me and you are friends.

467
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,326
Our girlfriends will also be friends.

468
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,335
We have three years left.

469
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,669
Whatever you said right
now, will be flipped!

470
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,844
Why don't you think like that?

471
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,141
Hey!
Come!

472
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:15,179
lt's time for breakfast!

473
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,281
Come.

474
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,486
- Rest we can talk after

475
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:29,891
(Playing Antakshri)

476
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,661
Sing a song that
starts with 'T'.

477
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:39,667
'Thamarappoovil' (Popular
Malayalam song starting with T)

478
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,796
So apart from your growling,

479
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,876
you know songs that normal
humans sing as well?

480
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,404
Austin had called me.

481
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,133
Don't forget to practice.
- l won't!

482
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,534
What are you listening to?

483
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:17,868
- lron Maiden.
- Okay!

484
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,343

singer of lron Maiden?

485
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,402
You dumbo!
Look over there!

486
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,539
- Nice.
- Okay okay. l'll be right back.

487
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:50,600
-Are you busy?
- Yes.

488
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,716
Dude, you'll get a chance to
spend a full day with Diya now.

489
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:58,683
How?

490
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,686
l don't have time to explain. Those
Northies are getting impatient.

491
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,288
Northies?

492
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,395
Enough.
Enough, brother.

493
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,833
Long back, during Dussehra festivals,

494
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:20,271
the King used to stand on top of this and
watch dances, songs and military marches.

495
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:21,874
Stop your history class, man!

496
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:23,709
Show us the next place.

497
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,269
Hampi is not a place to
be shown by someone.

498
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:29,806
lt should be explored
on your own.

499
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:33,385
Today,

500
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,615

503
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:44,229

504
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,699

But first, form teams.

513
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,553
Play it!

514
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:13,885
- Can l join you guys?
- No.You can't be on our team.

515
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:15,958

517
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,554
Go ask Diya!

518
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:23,799
Dude, ask her.

519
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,869
You want her on our team?

520
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,537
Shall we fight this war together?

521
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:30,939
Of course!
Devika?

522
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,035
Not me. Me and Gautham, please?

523
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:34,379
Sweetheart!

524
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:36,540
Okay. That's enough.

525
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:37,816
Are all of you ready?

526
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:40,046
l'm going to say the first clue.

527
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,787
'The sinner always goes to hell'

528
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:44,757
So all the best!

529
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:45,724
Play it!

530
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,518
Shall we also try?

531
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,555
- Should we?
- Why not?

532
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,098
Hell?

533
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,527
See if something is buried here.

534
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,438
What does 'Paapi' (sinner) mean?

535
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:00,564
What is this, man?

536
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,407
l'll search online.
You check the book.

537
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,703
- Where do we look?

538
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,046
Gautham, l found the answer.

539
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:10,749
lt's not fun being alone.

540
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:11,943
Shall l also join you guys?

541
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:12,984
You found it?

542
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:15,383
No one has figured it out.
We're the first ones.

543
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:16,920
We found it!

544
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,750
We got it!
We also got it!

545
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:24,629
Hey,

546
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:28,325
where do people who sin go to?

547
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,001
Either ajail,

548
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:31,760
or hell.

549
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:33,998
People who sin will go to a
church to make a confession!

550
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:37,934
Got it!
Come!

551
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,980
- Diya, wait!
- Didn't l tell you that she'll solve it?

552
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:46,518
Come!

553
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:51,056
What?

554
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,125
lf you sin,

555
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,425
you ask forforgiveness at..

556
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:57,629
a temple.

557
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,130
And hell,

558
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:00,465
is underground.

559
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:01,699
So what?

560
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,637
So beautiful.

561
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,127
True. Just like my house!

562
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:10,133
No one else has reached.
l think we're first.

563
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,006
Not first.
We're the last.

564
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:18,812
No one else is around. This
is the best chance. Go!

565
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,483
- Have the results come?

566
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,687
- Go!

567
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:23,812
- One minute.

568
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,458
Go!

569
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,959
You guys search inside.
l'll search outside, okay?

570
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,063
She's gone!

571
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:36,501
Varun,

572
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:37,991
we need to talk.

573
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:41,396
- What's there to talk?
- Varun, please.

574
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,836
The clue is in there.
But it's water all around.

575
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,510
l'll set you right.

576
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,569
Go take it, man!

577
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,039
You scumbag!

578
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,577
Varun, you were the first person
l met afterjoining college.

579
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:56,949
Of course, we became really close.

580
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,217
But l thought you would understand.

581
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,960
l am like this.

582
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,655
l'll become friends
with everyone easily.

583
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,021
A haunted house in Hampi?

584
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,166
Oh my God!

585
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,165
You said a lot of things that day.

586
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:13,064
But l forgot all of
that immediately.

587
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,972
Even afterthat, l've always
behaved normally to you.

588
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,075
But you..

589
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,968
l hope there are
sweets in the box!

590
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:22,013
Sheesh! Clue!

591
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,216
We are in the same class.

592
00:36:24,216 --> 00:36:25,706
We have the same friends.

593
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,519
How long will you
avoid me like this?

594
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,154
l got the clue.
Come!

595
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:39,464
Come dear!

596
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:43,057
We have to solve the next clue
quickly, overtake everyone,

597
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:45,535
and finish first.
- Go slowly man! Your bag!

598
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,003
From here, you should
go to 'Queen's bath'.

599
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:50,571
Once you get there,

600
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,200
'Don't worry. Be Hampi'

601
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:55,705
This is the place.

602
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:57,182
Come fast!

603
00:36:58,617 --> 00:36:59,584
Awesome!

604
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:00,852
Devutty, look.

605
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:04,680
Was this a bathroom?
Looks like a palace.

606
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:08,724
lf l had such a huge bathroom, l
would be bathing all the time!

607
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,729
First you bathe at
least once a day,

608
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:11,991
the rest you can do after that..

609
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,866
Shwetha, just search for
the clue over there.

610
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:18,737
- What happened, Devutty?
- Nothing!

611
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,905
What is it? Tell me!

612
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:22,271
- l said nothing.
- Don't get angry! Tell me the matter.

613
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,735
How many times have l told herthat her
behaviourtowards you is not right?

614
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,312
She is just being friendly..

615
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:29,906
Friendly! You are an idiot!
You don't know how girls are.

616
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:31,506
You do whatever you want.
l'm leaving.

617
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,018
Why should l care
about her behaviour?

618
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,319
l have my Devutty, right?

619
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:35,320
Stop kidding!

620
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,083
Your eyes..

621
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:41,190
-And it's so beautiful when you eat
mangoes & it gets stuck on your teeth!

622
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:43,161
- Get lost!
- l swear!

623
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:44,856
l didn't see anything!

624
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:47,089
l saw everything!

625
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,561
l saw a little!

626
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,001
We were just..

627
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,135
Nice place!

628
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,898
l wish l was born
as a soldier here.

629
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:55,073
Why?

630
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,007
See.. The walls are full of holes.

631
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:00,144
l could've seen the queens
bathing every morning for free!

632
00:38:00,212 --> 00:38:01,975
- Sheesh! Pervert!
- Pervert?

633
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,617
Hey! Stop there!

635

You chose the best
guy to help you out!

636
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,085
l won't give it!

637
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:22,560
10 Rupees for postcards!

638
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:31,003
Jagannath + 7.

639
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,371
lsn't that a temple?

640
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:34,273
That's in Puri, man.

641
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,347
Puri?

642
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:38,317
ls this the one?

643
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:41,878
- These kids' clues are so difficult.
- l told you that we'll stay away!

644
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:44,721
Who is this Jagannathan?

645
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,857
lt's been so long.

646
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:49,724
[Dialogue excerpt from a Mohanlal movie
'Aaram Thampuran' (Sixth Emperor)]

647
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:50,762
Jagannathan!

648
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:52,964
Not Jagannath.

649
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,257
lt's Jagannathan.

650
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:58,403
Emperor.

651
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:02,135
Emperor Jagannathan from
Kanimangalam Palace.

652
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,272
- Sixth Emperor.
- Plus Seven.

653
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,109
12th..

654
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:08,738
13th Emperor.

655
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:13,608
Sri Krishna Deva Raya.

656
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,679
The statue looks nice!

657
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:20,425
But he doesn't have the
looks to be an emperor.

658
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,256
- But our Mohanlal has it!
- That's true!

659
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:23,294
You know what?

660
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:27,129
There was a Portuguese traveller
in the 15th century.

661
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:31,633
He came to Hampi after visiting
London, Paris, Rome, etc.

662
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:36,742
He said that Hampi was the most
beautiful city in the world.

663
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,044
And this is the man who
built this whole city.

664
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,376
Back then, the population
here was around 5 lakhs.

665
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:44,040
But now there are only
3000 people here.

666
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,116
Why?

667
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,753
Religion, caste, riots, quarrels..

668
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:48,720
Same old story.

669
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,186
Even after 600 years, we
are still the same, right?

670
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:57,762
Clue.

671
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:05,337
This is not a tower.
This is something else.

672
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:06,429
What else can it be?

673
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,104
- l have seen this somewhere.
- l know. l've seen it too.

674
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:10,937
But l don't remember
where l saw it.

675
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:12,909
lsn't this that temple?

676
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,070
l've seen it somewhere!

677
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:17,308
- Virupaksha temple.
- Ya. Come. Let's go.

678
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,944
Virupaksha temple!
Come! Let's go!

679
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:23,449
Dude, that one...

680
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:25,884
Virupaksha temple.
Come!

681
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:27,125
Wait..

682
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:30,453
Aren't you coming?

683
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,423
This is the last clue, man.
Varun won't make it so simple.

684
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:38,736
What?

685
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:41,906
Dude!

686
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,503
This should be seen like this.
lt's not a tower!

687
00:40:46,912 --> 00:40:48,709
lt's a floor plan!
See!

688
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,847
Vithila temple.

689
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:51,482
Climb up!

690
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,054
Varun!

691
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,015
Varun, give us our first prize.

692
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,194
You are first?

693
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:04,059
l knew it! We came first!
Kuppi!

694
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,754
You aren't first either!

695
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:07,199
Then who won?

696
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,191
Him. He's been here for 3 hours
after solving all the clues.

697
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:14,538
Mirash?

698
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,772
- You wanna know what's the first prize?
- What is it?

699
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,470
Bring all the others.

700
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:29,747
Musical pillars.

701
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:33,024
This place is really
famous forthem.

702
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,317
These people don't come
here & perform every day.

703
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:43,998

the best gift you could get in Hampi.

00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:44,992
you have to go together, friends'

713
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:48,065
'Through these open paths,

714
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:51,033
with strong footsteps,

715
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:57,632
keep travelling ahead'

716
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,226
Day 1 is over, right?

717
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,251
Now we can go back to the
room & open the bottles!

718
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:18,296
Bro,

719
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,232
You are the man! The lightning!
The thunderstorm!

720
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:22,199
Move, man!

721
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:25,161
'While everyone else was
looking at the camera,

722
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,334
one guy alone was focusing elsewhere.'

723
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:35,442
- Come, come!
- Fast!

724
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:37,637
Keep quiet, man!

725
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:39,473
Go fast. Before someone comes.

726
00:43:43,355 --> 00:43:45,084
Get in!
Come on!

727
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:50,161
What?

728
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:52,163
We're screwed!

729
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:55,700
- Did someone kidnap our bottles?
- No dude!

730
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,328
This is some loser classmate of
ours trying to mess with us.

731
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,238
- This is no child's play!
- No!

732
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:02,707
Those bottles were bought with
the money we collected for l.V.

733
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:05,175
- l'm fed up of making false accounts!
- Fed up!

734
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:06,971
lf l find the guy who did this..

735
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:08,179
Mummy!

736
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:09,246
Hey!

737
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,047
l found this underthe seat.

738
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,316
Let me see.

739
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:14,644
'Answers on the other side'

740
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:20,291
Our classmates used to talk
normally to each other so far.

741
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,724
But now they talk only in clues.
Clues!

742
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:25,462
Suffer now!

743
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:27,999
Who is in the room
opposite ours?

744
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:28,966
Mirash.

745
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,736
He would faint even if he gets a
slight smell of alcohol. No chance!

746
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,260
Kuppi, opposite yours?

747
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:35,973
Chacko Sir.

748
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:38,543
lt's really likely that
he would've done this.

749
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:41,171
From his eyes, we can figure
out that he's a huge tank.

750
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:44,238
Dude, if it was Sir, this l.V
would've been finished by now!

751
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,478
You guys keep playing
these riddles!

752
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:48,313
Why is he getting
angry for that?

753
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:54,354
- Lovely Miss.
- Shut up, man!

754
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,223
- She's from Kanjirappally.
- One tight slap!

755
00:44:57,262 --> 00:44:58,229
Hey, come here!

756
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:03,100
What is it?

757
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:05,804
Answers,

758
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:07,101
on the other side.

759
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:11,241
So many steps!

760
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,148
l don't see any boat
or bridge here.

761
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:24,211
The closest bridge is
40 kilometers away.

762
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:25,481
What do we do now?

763
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:27,448
There's one way.

764
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,454
Pick it up!

765
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:37,695
Come on!

766
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:39,497
- Get in!
- Come on!

767
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:42,201
Hey! Aren't you coming?

768
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,375
No way!

769
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:46,069
The undercurrents would
be really strong.

770
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:48,313
8-10 people travel by
this everyday, man!

771
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:49,473
There's no problem!
Just come!

772
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:52,484
- That's when the driver is there, right?
- Driver?

773
00:45:52,484 --> 00:45:53,451
Come here, you!

774
00:45:53,518 --> 00:45:55,787
How're you so sure that the
bottles would be there?

775
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:57,084
l'll search in the hotel.

776
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:58,122
Call me if you find them.

777
00:45:58,823 --> 00:45:59,790
Dude!

778
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:02,688
Let's head south, guys!

779
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:06,020
Why aren't we reaching anywhere?

780
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:08,094
Dude, careful!

781
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:19,075
- Argh! The key is with Gautham!
- Cheers!

782
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,511
- Pour it.
- Open the Lays packet.

783
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:24,171
- lt's overthere.

784
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:31,589
Hey Varun,

785
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,850
l am scared.

786
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,183
Shall we go back?

787
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,690
lf you're scared,
you can go back!

788
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:40,097
l'm not coming anywhere without giving
a dose to the guy who took this.

789
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:43,594
Dude, go slowly.
We're also coming!

790
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,363
Gautham, hold my hand!

791
00:46:48,873 --> 00:47:32,108
MBRHDRG

792
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:42,456
- Open the door!
- Someone's knocking!

793
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:43,683
Who is it?

794
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,230
l see!

795
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,664
So you guys stole our bottles?

796
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:48,800
Tell me the truth! Where are
the rest of the bottles?

797
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,200
You gave just one bottle & now
you're asking forthe rest?

798
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:52,759
- What is this, man?
- One bottle?

799
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:54,899
Who gave it to you?

800
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:10,781
Oh Varun!

801
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:16,182
After coming to Hampi, is it enough if
we see some broken down palaces alone?

802
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,529
A side of Hampi which is not
exposed to the outside world.

803
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,297
There are no lndians here.

804
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,435
And ya, it becomes active
only in the night!

805
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:30,497
You guys were not
going allow that anyway.

806
00:48:30,842 --> 00:48:32,503
That's why we did this..

807
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:35,477
What?

808
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,186
Yes Sir!

809
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:48,622
Hey, what did he say?

810
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:52,687
We are his first lndian
customers today.

811
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:56,734
That's nice!

812
00:48:57,335 --> 00:48:59,633
You guys sit here.
We will bring them. Come!

813
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:02,306
- l'll be right back!
- Good set up!

814
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,970
Dude, come here!
Are we going to drink?

815
00:49:05,877 --> 00:49:08,004
- That won't be right!
- Why?

816
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:10,275
Will hell break loose
if girls drink?

817
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:14,283
Their lives shouldn't be constrained
to the four walls of our classroom.

818
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:15,683
- But l didn't mean that..

819
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,517
Aren't you both fed up of making them
suppress their desires & feelings?

820
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:22,624
- What did l do?
- l didn't know that you guys were so..

821
00:49:22,694 --> 00:49:23,820
Racist!

822
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:26,326
- Sexist!
- Case closed!

823
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:40,972
What's she talking about?

824
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:47,608
She has traveled all around lndia.
Even Kerala.

825
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:55,050
Selfie with foreigner madam!

826
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:58,021
'You scaredy cat! We're
having fun here!'

827
00:49:58,096 --> 00:49:59,324
Shucks! No signal here!

828
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:00,431
So strange!

829
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:03,857
These guys are the ones who've
seen more of lndia than us.

830
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:05,770
lt's very nice to hear all this.

831
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:08,705
But to roam around like this, you
need a lot of money! - Ya right!

832
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:13,037
You can go to Bekal Fort if you pay
just 7.50 for a ticket from your house.

833
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:14,544
How many times have
you gone there?

834
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:16,303
He hasn't gone!

835
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:20,710
-Are you drunk?
- Quite a bit!

836
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:22,386
Saw that?

837
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:24,885
These guys are really
enjoying their lives!

838
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:27,982
These guys live for themselves.

839
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:29,384
What does that mean?

840
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:30,694
That means..

841
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:33,092
Our parents lived for us.

842
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:38,098
Now after some time, we
will live for our kids.

843
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,939
And this will keep
going on like a cycle.

844
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:44,931
lf we live for ourselves,
who will live for our kids?

845
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,538
Let them live their
lives for themselves!

846
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:51,471
After 20 years,

847
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:52,877
at this same place,

848
00:50:53,851 --> 00:50:54,943
on this same day,

849
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:56,979
at this same time,

850
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,484
all of us will reach here.

851
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:01,850
Give me your hand!

852
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,927
Come on!

853
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:09,322
You remember, back then
at the electrical lab,

854
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:11,629
that schmuck Chacko Sir
asking for my l.D. card?

855
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,397
He asked me to pay 1000 Rupees fine, man!
1000 Rupees!

856
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:15,962
That idiot missed
all of this, right?

857
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:17,108
What to do?

858
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:18,473
lt is his own fault.

859
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:22,576
He is scared of water, he is scared to
sit, scared to walk, scared of heights..

860
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,944
How can someone be so
scared of everything?

861
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:26,450
Darshana,

862
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:28,109
can't you recognize
me from my face?

863
00:51:28,486 --> 00:51:29,453
You will!

864
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,521
She will!

865
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:32,614
Does Gandhiji have an lD card? No!

866
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,749
You gave me 1000 bucks!
l love you!

867
00:51:34,826 --> 00:51:37,556
l've planned a surprise
for you in Goa.

868
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:38,595
Surprise?

869
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,831
Like this...

870
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,663
- Shall l tell you something?
- Move!

871
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:46,464
l want to see him right now!

872
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:48,806
And tell him that l'll finish him!

873
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:49,862
l'm Kabali,

874
00:51:49,974 --> 00:51:50,963
l say!

875
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:53,610
Oh God!

876
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:56,146
How did they...

877
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:00,984
You too.

878
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:11,987
The l.V. is over with this.

879
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,630
All of you pack your bags.
We're going back to Kerala tomorrow.

880
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:20,398
Spineless, scaredy-cat,
what all did you call me?

881
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:21,961
Didn't l warn you
not to do any of this?

882
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,165
And see what happened!

883
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:25,176
By the way,

884
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:26,744
what are you going
to tell the others?

885
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:29,804
That the l.V. got cancelled because
you went to random bars with girls?

886
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:32,513
- Not bar. lt was a shack.
- Shut up!

887
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,584
Bloody!

888
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:36,678
l thought at least you would
show some responsibility. But why!

889
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,651
People have come to enquire.

890
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:42,450
l don't have anything
to do with this!

891
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,084
What to do?
Should l sit like this?

892
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:49,125
Dude, taking the bottles away, that clue &
going to the bar; all of it was their plan.

893
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,827
So? You should allow that?

894
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:52,727
You should have made
them understand

895
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:55,135
that it's not right for girls to
drink & roam around at night,

896
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:56,774
and brought them
back to their rooms!

897
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:59,004
lnstead of hanging out the
whole night with them,

898
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,235
and having fun..

899
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:13,749
Boys can drink, smoke..

900
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:14,984
watch blue films..

901
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:17,456
watch blue films, and
roam around all night!

902
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:19,163
lf a girl does this,
it become an issue?

903
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:21,222
l didn't think that you
guys were so sexist.

904
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:22,266
Racist!

905
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:28,238
That's true.

906
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:29,898
We are really sexist.

907
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:32,738
- Didn't l tell you that it's 'Racist'?
- Shut up! l'll kill you!

908
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,107
The fault is not yours.

909
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:37,808
We're the ones who
took you there.

910
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:41,247
There's no point arguing
about all this anymore.

911
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:43,110
We should figure out
what to do next.

912
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:44,688
lf Akshay helps us,

913
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:46,586
this can be solved.

914
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:51,760
lf Sir is impressed by anyone at
all in class, that would be him.

915
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:53,591
- ls it?
- Of course!

916
00:53:56,634 --> 00:54:01,298
(Morning prayer song)

917
00:54:07,979 --> 00:54:09,947
Your bloody hippie village trip!

918
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,847
And you had to go there
in that basket itself!

919
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,555
Going out from the hotel
without our knowledge,

920
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:20,324
drinking; that too with girls,

921
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,986
do you know how huge this issue
will be if we inform your parents?

922
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,756
Ask all the students to pack their
bags & come to the restaurant.

923
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:27,893
We have to leave before noon.

924
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:34,964
Before the l.V. started, we
had only very few conditions.

925
00:54:35,206 --> 00:54:36,173
But..

926
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:37,274
last night,

927
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:38,609
some of you..

928
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:40,711
broke all those
conditions together.

929
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:42,110
He has begun his counseling.

930
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,008
What all did we plan!

931
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,786
Bullshit!

932
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,023
l can't imagine facing
the rest of the class.

933
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:56,560
Dude,

934
00:54:57,028 --> 00:54:57,995
leave it!

935
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:13,308
MBRHDRG

936
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:17,272
Such a situation shouldn't
happen hereafter. Okay?

937
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:33,257
A doctorfrom America.

938
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:34,731
Mom's choice.

939
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,067
Dad has also approved.

940
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:38,262
l came for this l.V. to
escape from meeting him.

941
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:40,360
But now the l.V. is
cancelled, right?

942
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:42,801
Now l have no other
option than meeting him.

943
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:45,273
How will l make her
fall for me then?

944
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:57,116
l feel sad when l
see all yourfaces.

945
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:04,895
Goa?

946
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:12,732
Let the American go back
to America, Lovely.

947
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:13,861
We shall go to Goa.

948
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:20,211
This thing was waiting forthe l.V.
to start to break down!

949
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:22,913
Dude, how did Sir change his mind?

950
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:26,280
Simple! Sir is behind Miss!
Strong love!

951
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,446
How do you know that?

952
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,955
You should go to the staff
room at least once in a while!

953
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:32,923
But how! You don't even
come to the classroom!

954
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,224
Then we should go say thanks to Sir.
What say?

955
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:38,856
Before thanks,

956
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:40,753
let's tell him sorry first.

957
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:43,695
No need for an apology.

958
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:45,936
Even otherwise, it's not right
to punish all the others

959
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:47,699
for a problem created
by the few of you.

960
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:49,939
Just see that you don't
create anymore problems.

961
00:56:51,509 --> 00:56:53,033
- Let's go.
-Akshay!

962
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:56,875
You want to say something
to someone, right?

963
00:56:57,815 --> 00:57:00,283
Nothing happens in the classroom
without the teachers' knowledge.

964
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:02,386
Hey,

965
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:03,681
l'm saying this to you too!

966
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,985
You're standing here?
Aren't you coming?

967
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:08,759
Come fast, Sir.

968
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,317
Err.. l.. l'll come right now.

969
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:12,985
l'm right behind you.

970
00:57:17,168 --> 00:57:19,398
What? What's the joke?
Tell me!

971
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:20,931
Let me also have a laugh.

972
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:23,232
Without the students' knowledge,

973
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:26,767
nothing happens in the
staff room as well!

974
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:30,213
Err..

975
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:31,975
Nothing like that.

976
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:41,013
Watch it & come!

977
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:45,563
'So after a beautiful sunset in Hampi,

978
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:48,498
all of them started from there
to watch the sunrise, to Goa'.

979
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:51,435
Dude!

980
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,931
Shall we play a movie?

981
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:57,842
Everyone sit down please!

982
00:57:57,842 --> 00:57:59,243
- We're going to play a movie.
- Diya.

983
00:57:59,243 --> 00:58:00,335
Please come here.

984
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,172
Can you play this movie?

985
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:06,183
Go ahead!

986
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:23,800
Oops.

987
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:30,107
Don't stand like a pillar in front
of the TV & go sit somewhere!

988
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:31,575
You stole my seat!
Get lost!

989
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:32,542
You get lost!

990
00:58:42,086 --> 00:58:43,053
Just this once.

991
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:44,354
Both of us.

992
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:47,023
Carry on!

993
00:58:50,461 --> 00:58:51,428
Who is it?

994
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,426
Are you particular about
sitting in the window seat?

995
00:58:58,502 --> 00:58:59,469
Huh?

996
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,062
Are you particular about
sitting in the window seat?

997
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,139
Err.. No.

998
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,407
But l am!

999
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,290
Aren't you sitting?

1000
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:34,628
When l was insisting on
sitting in the window seat,

1001
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:37,073
you would've thought
that l am crazy, right?

1002
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:38,441
A little bit.

1003
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:41,642
lf you look outside from here,

1004
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,077
you can dream with
your eyes open.

1005
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:56,453
Who is it?

1006
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:57,894
Dad!

1007
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:02,166
l won't be relieved until l tell
him what happened everyday.

1008
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:04,191
- He calls you everyday?
- Earlier he used to.

1009
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,197
But now we've
switched to WhatsApp.

1010
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:08,296
So..

1011
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,472
yesterday you were texting?

1012
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:13,209
Who else?

1013
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,277
Dad only!

1014
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:16,107
Great!

1015
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:26,879
'Has my world blended into
the moonlight unknowingly?'

1016
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:37,060
'Have l forgotten what l
always yearned to tell you?'

1017
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,974
- Narasimham (Action)
- Thattathin Marayathu (Romance)

1018
01:00:49,413 --> 01:00:53,406
'Traveling through the narrow
paths of this silent night'

1019
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:56,149
You're scared of
the dark, right?

1020
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,480
Shall l tell you a secret?

1021
01:00:58,555 --> 01:00:59,522
Okay.

1022
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:03,924
l was even more scared of
the dark than you are.

1023
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:06,296
Long back, during power cuts,

1024
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:07,923
l used to cry and
create a ruckus!

1025
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,523
l mean.. l didn't cry..
l used to create a small ruckus.

1026
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:13,725
So one fine day,

1027
01:01:14,071 --> 01:01:16,062
Dad made me sit on his lap,

1028
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,235
and showed me the
stars in the sky.

1029
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:21,337
You don't have to be scared
of what you can't see.

1030
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,672
You just have to enjoy the
beauty of what you can see.

1031
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:35,424
'Have l forgotten what l
always yearned to tell you?'

1032
01:01:37,428 --> 01:02:21,664
MBRHDRG

1033
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:50,266
Nice.

1034
01:02:53,237 --> 01:02:54,204
Go!

1035
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:55,372
Dude, go!

1036
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:56,339
She's moving.

1037
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:58,499
Did you kiss her?

1038
01:02:58,809 --> 01:02:59,776
Get lost!

1039
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:01,769
You little devil!

1040
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:31,140
lsn't it so beautiful just to watch the
girl we love even while she's sleeping?

1041
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:39,345
lt'll be like that for
the first week alone!

1042
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:47,349
Why are you sitting here?

1043
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:50,692
When was the last time
you watched a sunrise?

1044
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:58,668
The sun rises and sets everyday.

1045
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:00,894
But no one is really
bothered about it.

1046
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,267
Sometimes l think that..

1047
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:06,742
lf everyone just paused to watch the
sunrise at least once in a while,

1048
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:09,842
there wouldn't have been so
many problems in this world.

1049
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:19,218
Diya means 'Light'.

1050
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:23,660
You loser!

1051
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:26,452
So you bored her by being
so cheesy last night?

1052
01:04:26,563 --> 01:04:27,894
Sheesh! Get lost man!

1053
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,528
Hey. Varun is here. Look!

1054
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:33,237
The stay is good man!
Great place!

1055
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:35,262
- Dude, come!
- Coming. We'll eat something & come!

1056
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,932
- What are you doing?
- l'm making tea.

1057
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,703
- l know.
- l'll teach you. One second.

1058
01:04:43,814 --> 01:04:45,406
- Eat Devu.
- l don't want.

1059
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:47,916
- Have at least little.
- l ate a lot last night. l'm not hungry.

1060
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:50,954
- That was dinner. And this is breakfast.
Come on. Eat it properly.

1061
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:53,257
lf this causes some problem,
l'll take care of that.

1062
01:04:53,257 --> 01:04:54,622
So this is your full-time job?

1063
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,300
Now try it!

1064
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,260
l forgot.
l'm sorry.

1065
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:11,797
Hey! Hey! What
happened last night?

1066
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:13,765
Didn't you guys tell me..

1067
01:05:13,844 --> 01:05:16,278
that you've to make a girl smile
to make her fall for you?

1068
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:18,612
Last night she was
smiling a lot, bro!

1069
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:23,520
But every time she smiled,

1070
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,454
l was the one who was
falling harder for her.

1071
01:05:27,658 --> 01:05:28,818
He's a really sweet guy.

1072
01:05:28,926 --> 01:05:29,893
Very decent!

1073
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,256
l haven't seen him looking
at any girl so far.

1074
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:36,226
But l think he has some
soft cornerfor you.

1075
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:40,627
Don't talk rubbish.
He seems to be a nice guy.

1076
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:42,270
Did l say that he is not?

1077
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:45,303
But such nice guys have a greater
chance of falling for you.

1078
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:56,315
- Dude, aren't you coming?
- No! You guys carry on.

1079
01:05:56,386 --> 01:05:57,944
One minute. l'll just come.

1080
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,257
- l heard something about you.
- What?

1081
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:03,350
That you're deeply in love with me?

1082
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:05,661
Sheesh! Nothing like that!

1083
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:07,796
These guys are just
making false rumours.

1084
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:09,998
When college starts,

1085
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:14,630
we would discuss about the
girls in class, right?

1086
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:17,498
So l said that you looked cute.

1087
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:19,801
Since then they've
been going on..

1088
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:22,812
So you admit that l'm cute?

1089
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:24,506
l thought so back then..

1090
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:25,809
But now, not at all!

1091
01:06:26,049 --> 01:06:27,277
Dude, wait! Wait!

1092
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:33,914
Ever since l can remember,

1093
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,689
l have had many boys as friends.

1094
01:06:36,727 --> 01:06:37,694
But..

1095
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:38,989
there's just one problem.

1096
01:06:39,997 --> 01:06:42,693
Everyone ends up coming behind
me saying 'l love you'.

1097
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:45,025
With that, the friendship
would be closed!

1098
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:50,304
Why are you looking like that?

1099
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:54,410
You think that l'll also
come behind you like that?

1100
01:06:54,745 --> 01:06:55,677
No, no, no!

1101
01:06:56,580 --> 01:07:00,038
By the way, you were the one who
came and sat near me by yourself.

1102
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:02,044
My fear is whether
you are behind me!

1103
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:03,386
Get lost!

1104
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:05,621
Don't push me!

1105
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:19,667
'Like the sweet talks of little
waves in the gentle breeze,'

1106
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:28,537
'My heart talks on its own,
on seeing you, my darling'

1107
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:34,709
'The distances our
hearts are traveling',

1108
01:07:35,118 --> 01:07:39,748
'Distances hitherto unseen'

1109
01:07:42,793 --> 01:07:43,817
This is my father.

1110
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,563
This is my mom.

1111
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:50,522
This was taken when l went to meet my
cousin's gang studying in Christ College.

1112
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:52,926
This is some distant
cousin of my dad's.

1113
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:56,570
And ya, this is my
favourite teacher.

1114
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:03,912
lsn't it cruel to make
the kids sit separately?

1115
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,675
- Shall we set an example?
- How?

1116
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:09,719
Like this.

1117
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:17,522
'While the morning keeps following
your footsteps as a routine',

1118
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:20,953
When was the first time we talked?

1119
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:22,999
July 22nd 2015, Tuesday.

1120
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:26,127
When we got a free period, you
asked me forthe textbook.

1121
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:36,479
'When new paths
spread out before us'

1122
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:45,110
'We'll merge as shadows
under the same shade'

1123
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:51,422
'The distances our
hearts are traveling'

1124
01:08:52,896 --> 01:09:00,598
'Distances hitherto unseen'

1125
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,835
That girl never talks
to anyone or what?

1126
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:09,541
You know how many people
have asked me this?

1127
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:11,577
She's always on her own
with that book of hers.

1128
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,152
Can l see it?

1129
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:16,119
Gosh!

1130
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:17,915
Don't do all that!
She'll kill you!

1131
01:09:18,722 --> 01:09:20,155
How did you become friends?

1132
01:09:20,557 --> 01:09:21,751
Diya, Devika, Darshana.

1133
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:23,723
When l heard that name,
l decided immediately,

1134
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:25,954
that we will be thick friends
for the next four years!

1135
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:27,464
Because of her name?

1136
01:09:27,464 --> 01:09:29,591
But to be frank, we are like a family now.

1137
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:47,573
'These raindrops will shower
on me as your breezy smiles'

1138
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:58,559
'Slowly embracing me as a
cool wave, my dear sunshine'

1139
01:09:58,762 --> 01:10:06,601
'Like the sweet talks of little
waves in the gentle breeze,'

1140
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:15,505
'My heart talks on its own,
on seeing you, my darling'

1141
01:10:15,612 --> 01:10:21,244
'The distances our
hearts are traveling'

1142
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:27,256
'Distances hitherto unseen'

1143
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:30,627
- Hold this!
- This?

1144
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:32,959
This is not how you should
be dressed in Goa! Take it off!

1145
01:10:33,129 --> 01:10:34,096
Come on!

1146
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:37,067
Sheesh! You have nothing there?

1147
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:38,034
Sheesh!

1148
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:39,535
Here you go!

1149
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:47,944
Nice!

1150
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:50,669
So you also crack jokes, Lovely?

1151
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:58,779
Hey, it's time for your surprise.
We'll escape at the next stop. Okay?

1152
01:10:59,556 --> 01:11:00,523
Just us?

1153
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:02,785
Then what? Should we call
everyone else for all this?

1154
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:03,860
For what?

1155
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,953
Let that be. You just
have to come with me.

1156
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:08,331
l.. l have to ask Varun.

1157
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:10,697
You need Varun's permission
for everything or what?

1158
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:22,404
MBRHDRG

1159
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:24,981
Did she say where you are going?

1160
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:25,948
No!

1161
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:29,084
-
- Diya, wait!

1162
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:30,820
Shall l?

1163
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,583
So you'll be singing
duets from now on?

1164
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:36,783
Did she say what you are going to do?
- She told me not to call anyone else.

1165
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:39,123
Look at you!

1166
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:41,561
So you're going to turn into an adult?
- Sheesh!

1167
01:11:41,665 --> 01:11:42,791
Sheesh?

1168
01:11:42,866 --> 01:11:44,134
This is what people say!

1169
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:46,336
The bat should be given
to the guy who can hit with it!

1170
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:47,303
Sheesh!

1171
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,739
- Does he want to be a celibate
growing all that hair & beard?

1172
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:51,798
We don't want to be the
pricks in your paradise.

1173
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:53,900
l'll see to it that the
teachers don't notice it.

1174
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,345
But you have to be back on time.

1175
01:11:55,345 --> 01:11:56,334
Done! l'll do that!

1176
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:58,580
No, no! Wait!

1177
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:02,115
You're going as a boy.

1178
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:04,114
Come back as a man!

1179
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:10,226
Come. Let's go!

1180
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:11,193
Got it?

1181
01:12:11,428 --> 01:12:13,020
You paid the money?
- Yea!

1182
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:17,730
- You are slow!
- That's true!

1183
01:12:18,068 --> 01:12:19,336
Can't you go faster?
- Huh?

1184
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:20,303
Just go fast!

1185
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,172
Devutty, where are we going?

1186
01:12:22,172 --> 01:12:23,139
Just wait!

1187
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:27,240
Don't let the map fly away!

1188
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:34,010
This way! This way!

1189
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:35,051
Ya! That one!

1190
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:36,618
Devutty, what place is this?

1191
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:37,921
This is the place.

1192
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:38,922
Go slowly!

1193
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:40,014
Come fast!

1194
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:42,891
l can't. l'm going back.
This doesn't look good.

1195
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:45,728
Come!

1196
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:49,063
- lt's right here.
- Where are you taking me?

1197
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:55,930
They'll reach now.

1198
01:12:58,808 --> 01:12:59,775
Who is this guy?

1199
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:01,410
Devu!

1200
01:13:39,315 --> 01:13:41,112
She is part of the
Russian Mafia or what?

1201
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,121
What's the connection between
you & the Russian Mafia?

1202
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:28,364
His organs are in place.

1203
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:30,992
Tell me the truth! Why
did you bring him here?

1204
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:36,864
Uri had designed a
couple tattoo for us.

1205
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:37,940
Couple tattoo?

1206
01:14:39,476 --> 01:14:40,443
Take her away!

1207
01:14:41,244 --> 01:14:44,543
For both of us, a matching
couple tattoo like this.

1208
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:46,113
Couple tattoo?

1209
01:14:53,957 --> 01:14:55,151
Dude, what is he saying?

1210
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:00,219
l think he is really sad
about what happened.

1211
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:03,498
- He's saying that he will give us guns!
- Guns?

1212
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:13,776
Dude,

1213
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:16,443
you fainted seeing what?
- Needle.

1214
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:17,546
Huh?

1215
01:15:19,415 --> 01:15:20,382
Needle.

1216
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:23,317
l've been scared of
needles since childhood.

1217
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:30,421
'So Rockstar Gautham came
to be known as Needle-boy,

1218
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:33,896
and Devika as Tattoo-girl.'

1219
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:38,935
What happened?

1220
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:39,902
What happened?

1221
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:42,996
- l can't see anything here.
- l thought a needle struck me.

1222
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:44,073
Get lost!

1223
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:47,610
'Tattoo-girl, who realized that the
journey forward won't be smooth,

1224
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:48,945
became furious!'

1225
01:15:48,945 --> 01:15:51,937
Tattoo-girl! Needle-boy!
Tattoo-girl! Needle-boy!

1226
01:15:52,415 --> 01:15:53,973
Tattoo-girl,
Needle-boy,

1227
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:56,812
how come you're coming with us?

1228
01:15:57,053 --> 01:16:00,023
You don't have anymore strange
rituals like couple tattoos?

1229
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:00,990
Get lost!

1230
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:03,492
Dude, happy?

1231
01:16:04,627 --> 01:16:07,926
Do you some otherfearthat l'm not aware
of? Like cockroaches or lizards?

1232
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:12,068
lf there's something like
that, tell me right now.

1233
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,037
l don't have the skill to
guess it from your mumbling.

1234
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:17,429
We've reached the jungle.
Everybody get down.

1235
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:19,903
This has 21 gears.

1236
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:24,447
You're wearing a Sari
& riding a cycle?

1237
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,108
There are coquets
in the jungle too?

1238
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:29,118
l was the cycling champion
in MG University. Until 2002..

1239
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:30,085
Oops.

1240
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:31,447
Why is it like this?

1241
01:16:32,655 --> 01:16:34,390
l think this is a new model.

1242
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,880
See. This is my elder brother.

1243
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:37,290
He's quite good looking!

1244
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,061
Ya!

1245
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:40,986
My brother was really studious.

1246
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:42,121
A real intellectual!

1247
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:43,495
Soon after 10th standard,

1248
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:45,001
he had decided..

1249
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:47,170
Engineering from llT,
MBA from llM,

1250
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:49,539
2 years job experience in some
leading international company.

1251
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:51,541
And then to quit all that,
& start his own company!

1252
01:16:51,541 --> 01:16:52,599
And then?

1253
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:55,872
Last month was his company's
one year success party.

1254
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:57,608
At this age of mine,

1255
01:16:57,947 --> 01:16:58,914
my brother knew

1256
01:16:59,515 --> 01:17:01,415
what he wanted for
the next 10 years!

1257
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:02,484
And me,

1258
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:05,313
l don't even know which elective
to choose in the next semester.

1259
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:08,023
Hey, stop!

1260
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:11,560
There's something
wrong with my brake.

1261
01:17:13,096 --> 01:17:14,461
Ya. Brake.
Check the brake.

1262
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:16,465
What happened?

1263
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:18,534
Come!
Come!

1264
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:20,661
- Come! Come!
- Where are you taking me?

1265
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:30,543
You could've told her that you
were scared of needles, right?

1266
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:33,116
Why?
You can't say that?

1267
01:17:33,116 --> 01:17:34,083
Dude!

1268
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:36,481
lf you see me, would you think that
l'd be scared of needles?

1269
01:17:36,552 --> 01:17:37,519
So you're not?

1270
01:17:38,688 --> 01:17:39,689
l am!

1271
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:42,055
Then why couldn't you say that you
were not interested?

1272
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,457
Dude, it's not as easy
as you think it is.

1273
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:48,356
You will understand all that
only when you get a girlfriend.

1274
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:52,730
He won't let me be in
peace for even 5 minutes!

1275
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:55,037
Going on asking me to practice!

1276
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:59,199
He thinks that the people over there will
be queuing up to listen to our songs!

1277
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,177
Tell me the truth!

1278
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:03,546
Do you like our songs?

1279
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:05,014
Should l say the truth?
- Yea!

1280
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,311
lt sucks to the core!

1281
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:12,451
Dude, l also want to learn
Hindustani & Classical music.

1282
01:18:12,722 --> 01:18:14,417
They haven't tied you up, right?

1283
01:18:14,724 --> 01:18:16,089
lf you don't want it, quit it!

1284
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:19,388
Dude, from the time Devika saw
me, l have been like this.

1285
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:22,057
Rockband,
growling,

1286
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:24,659
and all these black T-shirts!
Bullshit!

1287
01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:28,102
One fine day if l say l don't
like any of these, she will..

1288
01:18:29,505 --> 01:18:30,665
What will she think?

1289
01:18:30,773 --> 01:18:32,206
What will she think?

1290
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:35,206
She fell in love with you seeing
your black T-shirt or what?

1291
01:18:35,278 --> 01:18:37,405
lf you can't even talk openly
about such silly things,

1292
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,243
what kind of a
relationship are you in?

1293
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,207
Devika is a sweet girl.

1294
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:42,510
We all know her.

1295
01:18:42,618 --> 01:18:44,142
All this won't be an issue for her!

1296
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,455
You are over thinking!

1297
01:18:45,455 --> 01:18:46,422
Dude!

1298
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,450
-Aren't you coming?
- You carry on.

1299
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:50,325
We will come.

1300
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:01,236
Dude!

1301
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:05,403
Should l deliberately rip apart the
Tyre of a car which is riding smoothly?

1302
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,211
Dude,

1303
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:10,313
right now, you just have
to change the Tyre alone.

1304
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:13,305
lf you keep going like this, you'll
have to change the whole car itself.

1305
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:15,639
Change the Tyre?

1306
01:19:16,352 --> 01:19:17,319
What?

1307
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:19,754
What's wrong with this Tyre?

1308
01:19:25,728 --> 01:19:27,218
Have you had a girlfriend?

1309
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:29,531
l've always wanted one.
But no one wanted me.

1310
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:31,266
What about you?

1311
01:19:31,334 --> 01:19:33,131
Even though l've had
many boys as friends,

1312
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:36,506
l've never felt that l
need boyfriend until now.

1313
01:19:36,506 --> 01:19:38,633
There are chances that you might
feel so in the nearfuture, right?

1314
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:40,107
We've reached!

1315
01:19:43,713 --> 01:19:45,340
Come. Let's go!

1316
01:19:48,684 --> 01:19:50,242
What are you looking at?
Come!

1317
01:19:58,661 --> 01:19:59,628
Come!

1318
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:43,205
Over here?

1319
01:20:43,306 --> 01:20:44,534
Tell me.
Truth or dare?

1320
01:20:46,742 --> 01:20:48,437
Choose 'Dare', you scaredy-cat!

1321
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:52,247
l will choose an adventure sport.

1322
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:54,239
You will have to do it.

1323
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:55,816
Para sailing!

1324
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:58,515
lt's so scary to even hear that.

1325
01:20:58,588 --> 01:20:59,577
What is it?

1326
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:01,350
You're scared of
anything & everything!

1327
01:21:01,424 --> 01:21:04,552
lf you only want to do things that you're
not scared of, why is it called a dare?

1328
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:08,224
Whatever you say
next, l'll do that.

1329
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:15,237
Got it!

1330
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:21,667
Bungee jumping?

1331
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:22,845
Me?

1332
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,440
lt will be awesome!

1333
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:27,512
All your fears will
be gone forever!

1334
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,342
l'll also be gone forever!

1335
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,382
You're breaking your
first promise itself?.

1336
01:21:33,923 --> 01:22:19,263
MBRHDRG

1337
01:22:21,837 --> 01:22:23,270
lf you're scared, don't do it.

1338
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:24,567
Leave it. lt's okay.

1339
01:22:27,243 --> 01:22:29,473
l have avoided many things
in life because of my fear.

1340
01:22:31,881 --> 01:22:33,007
l want to do this.

1341
01:24:55,191 --> 01:24:56,681
Can you give me your phone?

1342
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:06,396
That's my number.

1343
01:25:08,137 --> 01:25:09,934
l'll call you after
freshening up.

1344
01:25:11,674 --> 01:25:12,936
For the campfire,

1345
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,705
shall we go together?

1346
01:25:20,883 --> 01:25:21,850
Her number..

1347
01:25:22,551 --> 01:25:24,143
She will give it to me herself.
Wait & watch!

1348
01:25:27,857 --> 01:25:28,846
Where's my jacket?

1349
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:31,427
- Dude, that..
- Dude, what?

1350
01:25:31,427 --> 01:25:33,054
l saw you draping her.

1351
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:35,689
Next time when you feel so
affectionate, buy a raincoat for her!

1352
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:36,731
Understood?

1353
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,167
What's up?

1354
01:25:39,869 --> 01:25:42,861
ls it time to change your 'single' status
on Facebook to 'in a relationship'?

1355
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:44,096
Sheesh! No man!

1356
01:25:45,207 --> 01:25:47,402
We'rejust getting
to know each other.

1357
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,736
Even otherwise, she is not
ready for a relationship now.

1358
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:53,508
She can't be blamed for that. She
saw you just yesterday, right?

1359
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:54,844
- Not that.
- Then what?

1360
01:25:55,217 --> 01:25:56,946
- Did someone dump her?
- No!

1361
01:25:57,019 --> 01:25:57,986
Did she dump someone?

1362
01:25:58,053 --> 01:25:59,088
No man!

1363
01:25:59,088 --> 01:26:00,723
ls she a lesbian?
- No dude!

1364
01:26:00,723 --> 01:26:02,691
- Then what?
- Her parents got divorced!

1365
01:26:06,028 --> 01:26:06,995
Sorry?

1366
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:09,530
Even they haven't told me that so far.
And you're saying it?

1367
01:26:09,598 --> 01:26:11,566
They had a lot of
issues between them.

1368
01:26:11,634 --> 01:26:12,601
But..

1369
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:15,661
l never expected that
mom would walk out..

1370
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:20,174
That's why l didn't come
for class last week.

1371
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:22,141
l didn't want to come for the l.V.
as well.

1372
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:24,144
But when l sit at home,

1373
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:25,840
l'm reminded of so many things!

1374
01:26:29,585 --> 01:26:31,075
Dude, don't tell
this to anyone else.

1375
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:33,215
Dude, don't tell anyone!

1376
01:26:35,124 --> 01:26:36,113
l won't.

1377
01:27:46,629 --> 01:27:47,596
This is nice!

1378
01:27:50,332 --> 01:27:51,765
Very romantic!

1379
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:53,335
What's your intention?

1380
01:27:53,335 --> 01:27:54,825
lsn't this our first date?

1381
01:27:55,137 --> 01:27:57,105
So l thought it should
be a little romantic.

1382
01:27:57,206 --> 01:27:58,173
Date?

1383
01:28:05,681 --> 01:28:07,706
Where did you get this from?
- The shells were easy.

1384
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,717
lt was a little tough
to get the Tyre though.

1385
01:28:15,658 --> 01:28:17,853
Why aren't you talking about
your parents to anyone?

1386
01:28:18,227 --> 01:28:19,592
l have 8 cousins.

1387
01:28:20,729 --> 01:28:22,788
All this while, we
were an unruly bunch.

1388
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:27,563
But ever since they came
to know about mom & dad,

1389
01:28:28,137 --> 01:28:30,298
they have only sympathy for me.

1390
01:28:30,706 --> 01:28:31,673
l've had enough of that!

1391
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:33,708
At least,

1392
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:35,171
in front of these guys,

1393
01:28:35,311 --> 01:28:36,869
l'm still the old Diya, right?

1394
01:28:38,013 --> 01:28:39,139
Let it be like that only.

1395
01:28:43,719 --> 01:28:45,710
Diya, it's the song
we heard yesterday.

1396
01:28:45,921 --> 01:28:48,185
ln the bus, on the earphones!
Come!

1397
01:28:51,627 --> 01:29:35,636
MBRHDRG

1398
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:49,917
'Has my world blended into
the moonlight unknowingly?'

1399
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:58,759
'What l've always yearned to tell you'

1400
01:30:04,466 --> 01:30:05,990
- Devutty, please.
- Leave me.

1401
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:07,797
- Don't say anything now, Devu!
- Diya!

1402
01:30:09,138 --> 01:30:10,765
Why didn't you tell us anything?

1403
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:12,398
We are with you!

1404
01:30:16,945 --> 01:30:18,003
Devika, leave me!

1405
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:25,115
Didn't l tell you
not to tell anyone else?

1406
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,722
Am l just someone else?

1407
01:30:26,722 --> 01:30:27,882
l'm his girlfriend!

1408
01:30:28,257 --> 01:30:29,747
So you think he tells
you everything?

1409
01:30:29,825 --> 01:30:30,951
Akshay, don't!

1410
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:33,829
First tell her what you have to say.
Then you can talk about others.

1411
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:34,853
What's the problem?

1412
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:36,763
What's he talking about?

1413
01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:39,401
What is it?

1414
01:30:46,141 --> 01:30:47,335
What's the problem here?

1415
01:30:49,344 --> 01:30:50,311
- Hey!
- Huh?

1416
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:53,305
Did you smoke up?

1417
01:30:53,382 --> 01:30:55,043
Yes children, l smoked up!

1418
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:56,742
Let me tell you some truths.

1419
01:30:57,486 --> 01:31:00,189
Gautham is really scared of you.

1420
01:31:00,189 --> 01:31:03,852
And because of that, he doesn't
say a lot of things to you,

1421
01:31:03,926 --> 01:31:04,927
Kuppi!

1422
01:31:04,927 --> 01:31:07,987
and he'll always have a
mask when he's with you.

1423
01:31:08,197 --> 01:31:09,164
lsn't that bad?

1424
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,167
And you!

1425
01:31:13,202 --> 01:31:17,138
When you spread your
light all around,

1426
01:31:17,206 --> 01:31:19,241
many have been
burnt by it.

1427
01:31:19,241 --> 01:31:20,799
And one among them,

1428
01:31:21,176 --> 01:31:22,302
is him.

1429
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:23,945
Where?

1430
01:31:24,847 --> 01:31:29,307
-At least, don't do the same with Akshay.
- Kuppi, come with me!

1431
01:31:30,185 --> 01:31:32,915
- Go to your room.
- Varun, l'm not finished!

1432
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:36,488
What is he talking about?

1433
01:31:36,592 --> 01:31:38,890
Why do you wanna know?
To say it to everyone else?

1434
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:41,225
- Diya, l haven't said anything!
- Don't say that!

1435
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:42,430
Dude,

1436
01:31:43,065 --> 01:31:47,297
staying up during midnight
in the bus and talking to her,

1437
01:31:47,369 --> 01:31:49,360
telling her 'l love you';
- Dude, stop it!

1438
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:52,768
almost kissing her
after the bungee jump;

1439
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:54,206
Didn't you tell me about all this?

1440
01:31:55,477 --> 01:31:56,444
Leave me!

1441
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,547
lt's not like what you think!

1442
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,588
- l can't say it now!
- Why can't you?

1443
01:32:06,588 --> 01:32:08,283
- l can't say! That's it!
- Why can't you?

1444
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:16,490
Did l create a problem here?

1445
01:32:45,861 --> 01:32:46,828
Get lost man!

1446
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:28,160
Kuppi, open the door.

1447
01:33:28,236 --> 01:33:29,203
l can't.

1448
01:33:30,405 --> 01:33:32,600
l have a lot of things to do.
Open the door.

1449
01:33:32,674 --> 01:33:33,641
l won't.

1450
01:33:34,643 --> 01:33:36,941
l have to talk to you guys.
You can leave afterthat.

1451
01:33:37,346 --> 01:33:38,313
Today,

1452
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:40,480
today is the last day of our l.V.

1453
01:33:41,216 --> 01:33:44,413
l've been behind all of you since
morning to solve this somehow.

1454
01:33:45,354 --> 01:33:48,223
lt's true that last night l said a
lot of things l shouldn't have said.

1455
01:33:48,223 --> 01:33:50,359
But what l said wasn't wrong!
lt was the truth, right?

1456
01:33:50,359 --> 01:33:53,089
lt's a problem between us.
We'll solve it ourselves.

1457
01:33:53,195 --> 01:33:55,925
- You don't have to interfere.
- But l will interfere.

1458
01:33:56,264 --> 01:33:57,458
l have no other option!

1459
01:33:57,933 --> 01:33:59,491
You just want Diya to
fall for you somehow,

1460
01:33:59,968 --> 01:34:01,595
you want to be with
Devika all the time,

1461
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:03,900
and you think this l.V.
is some world cup.

1462
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:08,233
Each one of you had your own
reasons to come for the l.V.

1463
01:34:10,112 --> 01:34:15,072
But have you guys thought about
why l came for this trip even once?

1464
01:34:16,385 --> 01:34:19,354
l just wanted to have some fun
with you guys, you douche bags!

1465
01:34:21,523 --> 01:34:23,548
lt might sound really silly.

1466
01:34:24,226 --> 01:34:25,193
But until now,

1467
01:34:25,761 --> 01:34:28,696
l haven't even been able to click a
single photo with all of us together.

1468
01:34:30,065 --> 01:34:32,499
l'm not telling that you guys
shouldn't be with Diya or Devika,

1469
01:34:32,567 --> 01:34:34,592
or that you shouldn't
do yourjob!

1470
01:34:35,237 --> 01:34:37,000
But this precious time
when we are together,

1471
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:39,498
don't waste it by fighting
against each other.

1472
01:34:40,308 --> 01:35:00,423
MBRHDRG

1473
01:35:01,096 --> 01:35:02,063
Dude,

1474
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:04,655
'Dil Chahta Hai' (Movie)
was shot here, right?

1475
01:35:06,234 --> 01:35:07,201
Of course!

1476
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:10,237
After coming to
such a famous spot,

1477
01:35:10,305 --> 01:35:13,108
isn't it really bad if we don't
take at least a single photo?

1478
01:35:13,108 --> 01:35:14,473
lt will be really bad.

1479
01:35:14,676 --> 01:35:15,608
But..

1480
01:35:16,278 --> 01:35:19,008
we need a camera to
take a photo, right?

1481
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:20,782
l don't have a camera.

1482
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:22,215
l have a camera with me.

1483
01:35:24,653 --> 01:35:27,213
So now we just need someone
to click the photo.

1484
01:35:27,656 --> 01:35:29,146
l don't know how to take photos.

1485
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:31,522
- Do you know?
- Not at all!

1486
01:35:31,793 --> 01:35:32,794
What about you?

1487
01:35:32,794 --> 01:35:34,091
Even l don't know.

1488
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:36,595
Now who will do it for us?

1489
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,624
Enough. Go stand there.
l'll click.

1490
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,035
Kuppi,

1491
01:35:41,103 --> 01:35:42,104
you were here?

1492
01:35:42,104 --> 01:35:43,503
l didn't see you, l swear!

1493
01:35:43,805 --> 01:35:44,794
Don't overact!

1494
01:35:45,207 --> 01:35:46,174
Go stand there.

1495
01:35:46,508 --> 01:35:48,305
Sorry dude.
- Give me the camera.

1496
01:35:48,376 --> 01:35:50,640
Sorry sweetheart. We
won't fight again!

1497
01:35:52,047 --> 01:35:53,014
Come here!

1498
01:35:53,815 --> 01:35:54,782
Sorry bro!

1499
01:36:05,293 --> 01:36:06,294
Go..

1500
01:36:06,294 --> 01:36:07,261
Go stand there.

1501
01:36:07,329 --> 01:36:09,297
What?
Go stand there, you idiot.

1502
01:36:17,205 --> 01:36:19,469
That thing which Aamir Khan
leaned on is gone, dude!

1503
01:36:21,209 --> 01:36:22,506
lt's been 15 years, right?

1504
01:36:22,878 --> 01:36:25,779
Even otherwise, what's there that
will survive for so many years?

1505
01:36:50,272 --> 01:36:52,206
Devutty, don't cut the call.
Please.

1506
01:36:52,274 --> 01:36:53,241
What is it?

1507
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:56,106
l'm not the kind of person you think l am.
l have anotherface.

1508
01:36:56,211 --> 01:36:57,178
Another face?

1509
01:36:57,245 --> 01:36:58,803
Who are you? A ripper?.
Or a gangster?

1510
01:36:59,214 --> 01:37:00,849
l'll make you understand all that.

1511
01:37:00,849 --> 01:37:04,114
There's a library right next to you.
Can you please come there?

1512
01:37:27,409 --> 01:37:28,376
Oh dear!

1513
01:37:33,882 --> 01:37:34,883
What is this?

1514
01:37:34,883 --> 01:37:35,907
What is this man?

1515
01:37:36,151 --> 01:37:37,209
l haven't seen it so far.

1516
01:37:37,285 --> 01:37:38,718
lt's nice, dude. Suits you.

1517
01:37:50,832 --> 01:37:53,801
Why the hell can't you pick up the phone?
How long have l been calling you?

1518
01:37:53,969 --> 01:37:55,869
Did you forget about
next weeks' competition?

1519
01:37:55,937 --> 01:37:57,871
We haven't practiced much.
And you..

1520
01:37:58,306 --> 01:37:59,273
What happened?

1521
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:00,701
Why don't we stop this?

1522
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:04,776
To be frank, our band's
songs are really pathetic.

1523
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,245
They suck to the core!

1524
01:38:06,748 --> 01:38:08,613
Aren't you in your
final year now?

1525
01:38:08,817 --> 01:38:12,253
Study something, get a placement &
try to be settled in life, man!

1526
01:38:13,455 --> 01:38:14,422
Nonsense!

1527
01:38:20,929 --> 01:38:22,624
Say something, Devutty.

1528
01:38:26,735 --> 01:38:28,464
You needn't have
shortened it so much.

1529
01:38:32,974 --> 01:38:34,942
'So, by solving the
problems one by one,

1530
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:39,543
they reached the tour's last location
to celebrate New Year's eve.

1531
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:41,181
Sundown party.'

1532
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:47,481
Hey Gautham, can you come with me?
- One second.

1533
01:38:55,297 --> 01:38:58,630
lt has not even been
a year since we met.

1534
01:39:00,335 --> 01:39:06,968
There are a lot of things that we
need to know about each other.

1535
01:39:52,887 --> 01:39:54,650
'After planning
everything so carefully,

1536
01:39:54,723 --> 01:39:56,291
Varun never expected
such a setback.

1537
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:57,724
All of them lost their money,

1538
01:39:57,826 --> 01:39:59,316
the New Year plans were ruined,

1539
01:39:59,394 --> 01:40:00,861
and Varun became really sad.'

1540
01:40:02,664 --> 01:40:05,895
'But there was something else
which Varun never expected.'

1541
01:40:05,967 --> 01:40:07,669
Dude, why are you saying sorry?

1542
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:09,671
Leave it, man! l'll get
the money from you later.

1543
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:10,797
Shut up you idiot!

1544
01:40:10,939 --> 01:40:14,670
'That his friends wouldn't stop
supporting him just like that'.

1545
01:40:16,411 --> 01:40:17,708
you don't have to worry at all!

1546
01:40:17,812 --> 01:40:18,938
l'm there for you!

1547
01:40:20,648 --> 01:40:23,048
l mean, we are all
there for you. All of us!

1548
01:40:23,852 --> 01:40:25,410
Did you hear that?
All of us, it seems!

1549
01:40:25,587 --> 01:40:27,885
All of them are openly saying
what they wanted to say,

1550
01:40:28,823 --> 01:40:30,688
do you have something
to say, teacher?. - No!

1551
01:40:31,092 --> 01:40:32,320
Varun,

1552
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:35,295
lf not Sundown party,
we'll find some other party!

1553
01:40:35,363 --> 01:40:37,627
You think it's difficult to
find a party in Goa?

1554
01:40:41,736 --> 01:40:44,000
'Even while everyone was
searching for a party,

1555
01:40:44,105 --> 01:40:46,073
Diya was still upset.

1556
01:40:46,141 --> 01:40:49,744
And because of that, Akshay wasn't really
interested in searching for a party.

1557
01:40:49,744 --> 01:40:50,711
But..'

1558
01:41:05,527 --> 01:41:07,051
- You're a Malayali?
- Yes.

1559
01:41:07,662 --> 01:41:08,924
There's a party
happening inside.

1560
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:12,059
A foam party organized by
a major Malayali shark!

1561
01:41:13,535 --> 01:41:14,866
Can you get me tickets
forthat one?

1562
01:41:14,969 --> 01:41:16,960
lt's not suitable for
your size & age.

1563
01:41:17,505 --> 01:41:19,473
Bro, please don't say that.
Somehow.. Please.

1564
01:41:20,175 --> 01:41:21,437
lt's almost over.

1565
01:41:21,843 --> 01:41:23,401
Anyway, you can go in & watch.

1566
01:41:23,478 --> 01:41:24,445
Wh.. Where?

1567
01:41:25,547 --> 01:41:26,844
Okay brother.
Thanks.

1568
01:41:27,115 --> 01:42:33,811
MBRHDRG

1569
01:42:39,187 --> 01:42:40,711
So you're brothers?

1570
01:42:42,023 --> 01:42:42,990
Yes.

1571
01:42:47,061 --> 01:42:48,028
Shucks!

1572
01:42:48,763 --> 01:42:49,752
Missed a chance!

1573
01:42:50,565 --> 01:42:51,725
Yourfavourite, Sir.

1574
01:42:57,572 --> 01:43:01,736
lt was a New Year party l
threw for my colleagues.

1575
01:43:02,177 --> 01:43:03,711
l haven't told anyone at home.

1576
01:43:03,711 --> 01:43:07,238
lf l say that you were dancing
with foreign ladies covered in foam,

1577
01:43:08,016 --> 01:43:11,042
not just parents, even
friends won't believe it.

1578
01:43:14,222 --> 01:43:15,189
You know what?

1579
01:43:15,924 --> 01:43:17,949
l haven't gone for a single l.V.
yet.

1580
01:43:18,026 --> 01:43:19,050
l know that very well.

1581
01:43:19,127 --> 01:43:20,628
Dad had called me even today.

1582
01:43:20,628 --> 01:43:22,797
Because you ran around getting
first ranks everywhere,

1583
01:43:22,797 --> 01:43:24,128
it's hard for me to
survive at home.

1584
01:43:24,999 --> 01:43:26,762
l didn't run.
l was forced to run.

1585
01:43:27,702 --> 01:43:30,671
When the entire family is full of
engineers, doctors & civil servants,

1586
01:43:30,772 --> 01:43:34,264
we can't blame them for wanting
us to reach an llT at least.

1587
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:36,537
There's something that
l have learned.

1588
01:43:37,145 --> 01:43:39,136
Our parents are always worried
about our well-being.

1589
01:43:39,747 --> 01:43:42,648
But we can make certain
decisions better than them.

1590
01:43:43,117 --> 01:43:45,813
From the day you realize
that, things will be smooth.

1591
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:49,952
lt's easy to talk after
being so successful.

1592
01:43:50,191 --> 01:43:51,158
And me?

1593
01:43:51,793 --> 01:43:53,158
When l think about the future,

1594
01:43:53,695 --> 01:43:54,963
l'm really confused.

1595
01:43:54,963 --> 01:43:56,931
Who doesn't have
confusion in your age?

1596
01:43:57,232 --> 01:43:58,927
Do you think l wasn't confused?

1597
01:44:00,068 --> 01:44:01,660
Only if you are confused now,

1598
01:44:01,736 --> 01:44:03,260
you can be confident
in your future.

1599
01:44:03,771 --> 01:44:05,671
Don't break your head
over all these things,

1600
01:44:06,107 --> 01:44:08,803
and try to enjoy the small
moments in your campus life.

1601
01:44:10,278 --> 01:44:12,075
l.V, Arts Festival,

1602
01:44:12,313 --> 01:44:13,280
Farewell,

1603
01:44:14,182 --> 01:44:15,740
and college romance.

1604
01:44:18,553 --> 01:44:20,282
Whateverthat has to be
done during these days,

1605
01:44:20,822 --> 01:44:25,122
cannot be recreated later
however much we try.

1606
01:44:30,164 --> 01:44:31,165
Hey!

1607
01:44:31,165 --> 01:44:32,333
Where were you all this while?

1608
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:35,169
We've been searching for you everywhere!
- Dude, this is my brother.

1609
01:44:35,169 --> 01:44:37,103
Brother?.
This beard-o?

1610
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:40,141
Akash!

1611
01:44:40,141 --> 01:44:41,108
Brother!

1612
01:44:44,178 --> 01:44:45,304
What about the party?

1613
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:48,116
Like Chacko Sir said, there
are plenty of parties in Goa.

1614
01:44:48,116 --> 01:44:49,708
But there are tickets for none.

1615
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:50,842
What's the problem?

1616
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:52,745
l forgot to tell you.

1617
01:44:52,987 --> 01:44:55,012
The tickets we bought
for Sundown were fake.

1618
01:44:55,123 --> 01:44:56,988
All of us are looking
for another party.

1619
01:44:57,225 --> 01:44:59,693
By the way, is some
party happening here?

1620
01:45:03,398 --> 01:45:05,662
- This one just got over.
- What to do now?

1621
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:07,360
Goa is really huge.

1622
01:45:08,202 --> 01:45:09,863
l don't have any
idea where to start.

1623
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:13,207
Come!

1624
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:27,678
This is the oldest shack here.

1625
01:45:29,223 --> 01:45:32,681
No party will happen in Goa
without being on this wall.

1626
01:45:46,307 --> 01:45:47,399
My flight is at 7.

1627
01:45:48,142 --> 01:45:50,007
l have a meeting early
in the morning itself.

1628
01:45:51,079 --> 01:45:53,013
Don't tell anyone at home
that you saw me here.

1629
01:45:56,184 --> 01:45:57,151
Okay then.

1630
01:45:57,318 --> 01:45:58,410
Find a party,

1631
01:45:59,087 --> 01:46:00,884
and enjoy new year's
eve with your friends.

1632
01:46:01,823 --> 01:46:02,790
What party!

1633
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:03,857
l have given up!

1634
01:46:06,427 --> 01:46:07,394
Hey,

1635
01:46:08,096 --> 01:46:09,996
don't be tensed about Diya.

1636
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:13,195
People say that women
are really complicated,

1637
01:46:13,267 --> 01:46:15,167
and no one can understand
what they want, etc.

1638
01:46:16,204 --> 01:46:17,171
But..

1639
01:46:17,739 --> 01:46:21,106
any woman's anger would be long gone
if you say a sorry from your heart.

1640
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:23,877
Shall l go?

1641
01:46:43,364 --> 01:46:45,457
Dude, did you see a
poster called 'Red Dawn'?

1642
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,700
All of you check for
the Red Dawn poster.

1643
01:46:47,769 --> 01:46:50,033
- lt was right here.
- Don't look for anything else.

1644
01:46:53,207 --> 01:46:54,174
Got it?

1645
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:04,281
- Dude, what happened?
- Tickets are available.

1646
01:47:05,486 --> 01:47:07,420
They said it's happening
on a private island.

1647
01:47:07,822 --> 01:47:09,722
l don't think it would
fit in our budget.

1648
01:47:10,091 --> 01:47:11,058
Dude,

1649
01:47:11,159 --> 01:47:12,456
we will arrange the money!

1650
01:47:13,094 --> 01:47:14,152
We will go there!

1651
01:47:37,084 --> 01:47:39,086
We're short of 9000 Rupees.

1652
01:47:39,086 --> 01:47:40,314
There's no one left to ask.

1653
01:47:42,190 --> 01:47:44,959
lf you tell this to the HOD,
teachers or other students,

1654
01:47:44,959 --> 01:47:46,722
you will know see this
Chacko's true face!

1655
01:47:47,195 --> 01:47:49,163
But we can say this
to Lovely Miss, right?

1656
01:47:49,263 --> 01:47:50,230
Say it!

1657
01:47:51,566 --> 01:47:54,194
Okay guys, our new year plans
are finally confirmed.

1658
01:47:54,268 --> 01:47:56,793
At 10.30 PM, everyone should
wait in front of the hotel.

1659
01:47:56,904 --> 01:47:58,337
From the hotel,
straight to the port.

1660
01:47:58,406 --> 01:47:59,873
From the port,
straight to the boat,

1661
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:01,942
and from the boat, straight
to a private island!

1662
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:11,175
Diya hasn't come?

1663
01:48:11,385 --> 01:48:12,352
No.

1664
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:32,463
ls this Diya's father?.

1665
01:48:32,573 --> 01:48:33,835
l'm her professor.

1666
01:48:33,941 --> 01:48:35,966
Chacko Sir, right?
l know.

1667
01:48:36,444 --> 01:48:38,469
l had taken your number
from her before she left.

1668
01:48:39,046 --> 01:48:41,014
Sir, l called you to
say something else.

1669
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:51,058
l heard that you're
on strike over there?

1670
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,894
Your friends are waiting
for you downstairs.

1671
01:48:55,329 --> 01:48:56,455
l'm not in a mood.

1672
01:48:56,531 --> 01:48:59,898
lt it because you're not in a mood or
because it's difficult to face them?

1673
01:49:02,203 --> 01:49:03,170
Dear,

1674
01:49:04,105 --> 01:49:06,938
when l married your mother,
l was 30 years old,

1675
01:49:07,241 --> 01:49:08,606
and she was just 18.

1676
01:49:09,410 --> 01:49:10,934
That is your current age.

1677
01:49:11,946 --> 01:49:15,575
Even though we tried a lot,
our interests weren't mutual.

1678
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:17,317
That's all!

1679
01:49:17,618 --> 01:49:19,854
Your mom will always be
a good friend to me,

1680
01:49:19,854 --> 01:49:20,878
and vice versa.

1681
01:49:20,955 --> 01:49:23,116
You're not going to lose
anyone like you fear.

1682
01:49:24,225 --> 01:49:27,628
These things which are making you sad right
now, will seem funny to you in the future.

1683
01:49:27,628 --> 01:49:32,224
So my dear, get ready quickly & enjoy
this new year's eve with your friends!

1684
01:49:33,334 --> 01:49:34,301
Go!

1685
01:49:42,510 --> 01:49:46,213
Hey! Our heroine is here!
Start the bus!

1686
01:49:46,213 --> 01:49:47,305
- Come, children!

1687
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:52,114
Josetta, the boat will leave in 10 minutes.
So speed away!

1688
01:49:52,486 --> 01:49:54,420
Done! l'll take care of that!

1689
01:50:03,197 --> 01:50:04,494
The boat is just reaching.

1690
01:50:08,536 --> 01:50:11,130
Dude, it's not coming here. lt's
going in the other direction.

1691
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:21,047
Can we get another boat?

1692
01:50:22,383 --> 01:50:24,943
l don't think there's any other boat.
That was the last one.

1693
01:50:26,654 --> 01:50:29,256
What the hell are you
looking for overthere?

1694
01:50:29,256 --> 01:50:30,917
See, finally you needed me!

1695
01:50:31,258 --> 01:50:32,486
- What for?
- Look!

1696
01:50:39,934 --> 01:50:41,925
Varun, you are nothing!

1697
01:50:42,136 --> 01:50:47,972
Dear, you are the real, the man,
the lightning, the thunderstorm!

1698
01:50:53,381 --> 01:50:54,348
Uri brother!

1699
01:50:54,448 --> 01:50:55,415
Russian mafia!

1700
01:50:56,050 --> 01:51:27,509
MBRHDRG

1701
01:51:59,613 --> 01:52:00,580
Josetta,

1702
01:52:01,082 --> 01:52:02,140
Watch out for those two.

1703
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:03,444
Both don't know how to swim.

1704
01:52:03,517 --> 01:52:05,451
- Keep an eye on them.
- Where are you going?

1705
01:52:05,519 --> 01:52:08,010
- To book the boat's return tickets.
- Sit down!

1706
01:52:09,090 --> 01:52:10,057
Hold this.

1707
01:52:18,132 --> 01:52:19,793
Son, l'm not advising you.

1708
01:52:21,836 --> 01:52:26,239
lf we think that our happiness should
come only after our responsibilities,

1709
01:52:26,674 --> 01:52:28,642
we will have time only for
those responsibilities.

1710
01:52:29,677 --> 01:52:33,340
And before the bat of an eyelid,
our hair would've turned Grey.

1711
01:52:33,514 --> 01:52:34,481
See this!

1712
01:52:36,484 --> 01:52:38,475
l'll take care of yourtickets.

1713
01:52:40,621 --> 01:52:42,020
You also make one of these, son.

1714
01:53:41,315 --> 01:53:42,509
Hats off to you!

1715
01:53:44,919 --> 01:53:47,683
You're really fond of making things
with paper like this, right?

1716
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:53,883
l knew it when Akshay was going on
stressing about this lantern festival.

1717
01:53:57,631 --> 01:53:59,622
l wasn't the one who
found this place,

1718
01:53:59,733 --> 01:54:02,201
and brought us all here.

1719
01:54:03,537 --> 01:54:04,504
lt was Akshay.

1720
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:41,833
Even though you've had
many boys as friends,

1721
01:54:42,409 --> 01:54:45,276
do you still think that you
don't need a boyfriend?

1722
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:43,393
'The distances our
hearts are traveling',

1723
01:55:43,771 --> 01:55:51,645
'Distances hitherto unseen'

1724
01:55:51,645 --> 01:55:58,642
'The distances our
hearts are traveling',

1725
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:06,283
'Distances hitherto unseen'

1726
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:18,339
From tomorrow, we're
back to the same old grind.

1727
01:56:18,339 --> 01:56:22,867
Lab, assignments, seminars,
the yucky hostel food..

1728
01:56:22,977 --> 01:56:23,944
Hey kids,

1729
01:56:24,478 --> 01:56:25,446
come fast!

1730
01:56:25,446 --> 01:56:27,715
At least something good happened
to you guys because you came;

1731
01:56:27,715 --> 01:56:29,342
when will my number come?

1732
01:56:40,294 --> 01:56:41,295
Kuppi!

1733
01:56:41,295 --> 01:56:42,523
Tell her your name.

1734
01:56:42,663 --> 01:56:43,891
Pull up your shorts.

1735
01:56:44,098 --> 01:56:45,827
- Go ahead! Say it like l taught you!

1736
01:56:46,667 --> 01:56:47,634
Go on!

1737
01:56:53,941 --> 01:56:55,602
l think Kuppi just won a lottery!

1738
01:56:55,876 --> 01:56:56,843
Katthi (knife)?

1739
01:56:57,344 --> 01:56:58,606
The bus will leave now.

1740
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:00,772
Hey, come let's take a photo.

1741
01:57:04,718 --> 01:57:05,685
Make it fast!

1742
01:57:05,753 --> 01:57:06,720
Let me focus!

1743
01:57:11,925 --> 01:57:13,051
- Got it?
- What the hell!

1744
01:57:13,127 --> 01:57:16,096
- He wouldn't have clicked anything.
- He didn't get it! ldiot!

1745
01:57:16,563 --> 01:57:18,292
l should move? You move first!

1746
01:57:18,766 --> 01:57:20,529
Very nice. Go that side!

1747
01:57:21,468 --> 01:57:22,435
Please move!

1748
01:57:23,037 --> 01:57:26,803
Even though it can't be said that
the trip changed everyone's lives,

1749
01:57:26,907 --> 01:57:29,899
certain small changes
happened to each one of them.

1750
01:57:31,145 --> 01:57:33,875
'Varun isn't always furious
alone like earlier.'

1751
01:57:34,448 --> 01:57:35,847
'He smiles once in a while now.'

1752
01:57:38,118 --> 01:57:40,052
'Gautham is not afraid
of needles anymore.'

1753
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:42,611
'And Devika who used to listen
to English songs alone,

1754
01:57:42,689 --> 01:57:45,089
has gradually started listening
to Malayalam songs as well.'

1755
01:57:46,727 --> 01:57:47,785
What's your name?

1756
01:57:47,861 --> 01:57:49,795
'Even though Akshay isn't
the old Akshay,

1757
01:57:49,863 --> 01:57:51,387
Diya is still the
same old Diya.'

1758
01:57:51,765 --> 01:57:53,528
- Did you like her?
- You didn't like her?

1759
01:57:53,634 --> 01:57:54,735
So you liked her.

1760
01:57:54,735 --> 01:57:56,430
Then do something.
- Propose to him.

1761
01:57:57,938 --> 01:58:00,441
'As soon as Chacko Sir
opened his heart to her,

1762
01:58:00,441 --> 01:58:01,874
Lovely Miss said Yes.'

1763
01:58:02,142 --> 01:58:03,700
'Some love stories are like that'

1764
01:58:03,944 --> 01:58:05,377
'There won't be any
twist at all'.

1765
01:58:07,548 --> 01:58:09,379
'As boyfriend & girlfriend,

1766
01:58:09,450 --> 01:58:12,820
Kuppi & Kathy started a wedding
photography business together.'

1767
01:58:12,820 --> 01:58:14,811
'And they have a fair amount
of likes on Facebook'.

1768
01:58:24,865 --> 01:58:27,095
'And ya, now about me.'

1769
01:58:27,167 --> 01:58:29,536
'That new year selfie which
Kuppi couldn't capture;

1770
01:58:29,536 --> 01:58:32,061
l drew it for him as
well as l could.'

1771
01:58:38,145 --> 01:58:40,375
'So how did you like
our small family?'

1772
01:58:49,723 --> 01:58:53,819
'Aanandam'
