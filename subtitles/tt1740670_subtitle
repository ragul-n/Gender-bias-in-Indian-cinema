1
00:00:46,473 --> 00:00:49,965
"Neither me nor my
heart could do anything."

2
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:53,644
"There is nothing which works."

3
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,438
"Neither me nor my
heart could do anything."

4
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:00,445
"There is nothing which works."

5
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:07,892
"It is the beginning.
It is the end."

6
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:11,395
"Whose mistake is this?"

7
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:15,593
"It used to happen, it happens now."

8
00:01:15,802 --> 00:01:18,134
"This is what happens."

9
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:23,101
"It has happened so,
it just happens."

10
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,778
"This is what happens."

11
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:38,018
"When the walls basked in sun..."

12
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:43,059
"what should i do if i miss her?"

13
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:49,428
"The people got up and walked away."

14
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:53,996
"What to do if the
shadow refuses to go?"

15
00:01:57,077 --> 00:02:00,478
"That moment has arrived now."

16
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,107
"I can't get along with anyone."

17
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:07,883
"That moment has arrived now."

18
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:10,649
"I can't get along with anyone."

19
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:18,254
"It is the beginning.
It is the end."

20
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:21,926
"Whose mistake is this?"

21
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:25,831
"It used to happen,
it happens now."

22
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,804
"It is hundred percent true."

23
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:30,740
"It is hundred percent true."

24
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:45,783
Relax. Anju. Anju, bring
your father's medicine.

25
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:56,761
Relax. Relax. Anju.
- Take it, mother.

26
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:00,199
Yes, drink it. Drink the medicine.

27
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:07,532
Father.

28
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:10,066
Yes. He is coughing a lot today.

29
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:12,111
Only today?
- Yes.

30
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:14,146
He coughs a lot daily, mother.
- Shankar.

31
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:16,145
Shall i say something
even if you feel bad?

32
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:18,579
Crush this physician and drink him.
- Hey, don't.

33
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:19,982
Otherwise you will never recover.

34
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:22,214
I've told you so many times to
visit some qualified doctor.

35
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,045
But you don't listen to me at all.

36
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:28,487
I want only the physician's brew.

37
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:31,655
Yes, this brew will lead
you to heaven. - No, brother.

38
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:34,359
Keep this spittoon down. - Hey,
brother! Keep it down. - Leave him.

39
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:37,061
What else? He is holding it
as if it is made of gold...

40
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:38,797
...and he won't get it in heaven.

41
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:49,347
Brother, why do you always say
such bitter things to father?

42
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,473
He must be feeling bad.

43
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,778
The man who is used to drink
the brew round-the-clock...

44
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:54,479
...doesn't feel bad about anything.

45
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,480
Look at this earring.

46
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,719
Haji's wife has ordered for it.
I have to give it by evening.

47
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:02,655
But i can't
concentrate on designing it...

48
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:03,821
...because of father's coughing.

49
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:07,128
Brother, but i've heard that no
one has seen haji's wife till today.

50
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:08,966
Have you seen her?

51
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,935
How wouldn't i? She
considers me as her brother.

52
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:15,200
Anyway, no one has seen
haji's wife in the village.

53
00:05:15,575 --> 00:05:19,136
You know he hides his
wife behind seven curtains.

54
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,443
Anyway, no one can
hide his wife from...

55
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:23,573
...a goldsmith, a
tailor and a doctor.

56
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,984
If she is a girl,
she will want gold.

57
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:28,016
If you want gold,
you need a goldsmith.

58
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,282
Brother, aren't you
crossing the limit?

59
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,791
Yes, forget it. You are selling
pickle after passing matriculation...

60
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,486
...and i couldn't open a
jewelery shop being a goldsmith.

61
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:40,562
Lord, when will i get money?

62
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:44,794
Brother, you will be able
to open your shop very soon.

63
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:46,337
I know everything.

64
00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:49,373
You go to meet her daily, right?
- Quiet.

65
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:52,611
You both are gossiping
there and your father...

66
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,203
...will die coughing here.

67
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,406
Coming, mother.

68
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:17,434
Nowadays the people don't
believe in astrology anymore.

69
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:20,602
That's why people have
stopped visiting me.

70
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:24,573
They have not lost faith
in astrology, but you.

71
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:27,971
Has your prophecy ever proved true?

72
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:34,448
Laxmi, i had not learned
astrology to earn money...

73
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:38,046
...but to know my
daughter suvarna's future.

74
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:42,784
And i've a strong belief that her
horoscope indicates a royal life.

75
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:46,556
Lord, at least his one
prophecy should prove true.

76
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:52,604
What a cough! This old man
coughs in a new style daily.

77
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:04,014
I had given suvarna's earrings
to his goldsmith son shankar...

78
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,448
...to mend them.

79
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,180
Has he mended them?

80
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,811
If you have given him,
he will mend them.

81
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:10,248
Two months have passed.

82
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:12,785
If you meet shankar,
then remind him.

83
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,849
Last monsoon you had promised to...

84
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:18,257
...get this old wedding
necklace designed into a new one.

85
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:22,025
Do you think of anything else except
melting and redesigning gold?

86
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:30,474
By the way, our priest has sent
a photo of the boy from dubai.

87
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,302
His name is ravi.
- I see.

88
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,970
He runs a transport
business in dubai.

89
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:37,377
Ravi is the best of all.

90
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,946
He will keep suvarna like a queen.

91
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:42,585
Has the priest found out
about his family members?

92
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:44,885
Yes, they belong to the
nearby village tarapur. - Okay.

93
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:46,583
He said that his
family is decent, too.

94
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:48,326
But his parents are no more.

95
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:51,522
What? Very good. It is a
very good thing. - What?

96
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:54,965
No, you said that he belongs
to a decent family, so...

97
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,804
the photo is kept in the cupboard.

98
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:03,205
Show it to suvarna and
tell her to select it.

99
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,947
Just watch, once this proposal
from the dubai boy gets fixed...

100
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,579
...i'll get a ten
'tola' (weight measure)...

101
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,747
...necklace designed for suvarna.

102
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:18,888
The villagers of
sonapur will keep gaping.

103
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:23,159
By the way, where is suvarna?

104
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:25,727
Where else will she go? She
has gone to computer classes.

105
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:26,924
She must be coming.

106
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:28,525
Computer?

107
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:07,297
Okay, bye.
- Bye.

108
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:12,742
How are you, sona?
- Fine.

109
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,670
Really? How wonderful!

110
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:19,151
Along with learning computer,
you have learnt good english, too.

111
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:23,579
Thank you. Our teacher
speaks only in english.

112
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:27,092
You should learn it, too. Computer.

113
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:31,089
Really? You teach me
after our wedding.

114
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,900
I thought you must have left
after waiting for so long.

115
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:37,299
How could i have left?

116
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:40,262
If it was in my hands, i would
wait here for you for a lifetime.

117
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:44,968
You look very beautiful today.

118
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:48,036
Really? Don't i look
beautiful every day?

119
00:09:48,147 --> 00:09:50,308
No, i mean to say, you
look beautiful daily...

120
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,583
...but you are looking
very beautiful today.

121
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,820
What's the use of
looking beautiful?

122
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:58,020
I don't like to meet stealthily.

123
00:09:58,357 --> 00:09:59,984
You will have to do something soon.

124
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:04,992
Don't worry. Come here, i'll
show you something. - But...

125
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,459
sit here.

126
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:14,698
Look at this.

127
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,668
This is for your right ear
and this is for your left ear.

128
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:21,442
How did you think that i
would forget your birthday?

129
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:24,808
Really? For me?
- Yes.

130
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:26,177
They are fantastic.

131
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:30,881
But is it the same which
papa had given to redesign?

132
00:10:33,226 --> 00:10:36,423
It is the same. But your papa
had told me make it of 1 'tola'.

133
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:39,225
It contains two ounce more from me.

134
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:42,164
By the way, you are fortunate
that you are getting gold...

135
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:43,327
...as a gift on your birthday.

136
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:48,573
That's true. But you give it
to papa or he will have a doubt.

137
00:10:49,575 --> 00:10:53,238
All right. Now come and sit
in front, we'll go for a ride.

138
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:56,040
I've told you so
many times, i won't sit.

139
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:58,113
What if someone sees us?

140
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:00,216
Don't you understand?

141
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,146
Look, sona, your miser father...

142
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:04,018
...won't buy a car
for you in this birth.

143
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:05,924
At least sit on my cycle.

144
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,620
One round, two minutes. Please.

145
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:39,514
She is hell bent on ruining me.

146
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:42,259
If i spare this lady teacher today,
it will go on forever.

147
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:46,562
Teacher, will you dance on my head?

148
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,131
Teacher, come down and see.

149
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:52,768
Everything is ruined in my kitchen.
- Wait a sec.

150
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:57,968
And you are dancing like a
fairy and teaching the children?

151
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:01,476
Watch it, one day this
entire building will collapse.

152
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:10,622
Okay, this is enough for today.
Come early tomorrow.

153
00:12:10,823 --> 00:12:12,256
We'll try to complete
our practice before...

154
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:14,384
...a crowd gathers at the tea stall.

155
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,088
Come on, join hands.

156
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:24,267
Watch it, one day, not
only this building...

157
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:27,597
...but this entire world will
be trampled under her feet.

158
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:30,335
Why don't you let
geeta live in peace?

159
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,773
You are taking the curse
of a good girl needlessly.

160
00:12:32,845 --> 00:12:35,575
There is no woman in
this world who can curse me.

161
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:36,941
I am telling you.

162
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,674
And this is the
oldest building here.

163
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:43,284
Haji's father had
got it constructed.

164
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:46,958
And this dancer is hell
bent on bringing it down.

165
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,722
Then why don't you
speak to haji about it?

166
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,992
How strange! As if you
don't know anything.

167
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,567
You know that haji
doesn't listen to anyone...

168
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:57,829
...except his third wife.

169
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:03,031
And it is very risky to go
to his house in her presence.

170
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,236
What are you saying?

171
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:21,854
Its mother is an american
and father an afghani. - I see.

172
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,858
You won't get to see such a
breed in this world. Tell me.

173
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:30,327
Are its teeth still intact?
Are its horns fake?

174
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:33,895
Will she give 15 litres of
milk at a time? - Wait. Wait.

175
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:37,235
Are you an idiot and blind as well?

176
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:41,242
Can't you see? Come on, get up.

177
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:46,018
May whoever its parents be,
but i won't give you...

178
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:48,053
...a single paisa more than rs.
5000 for it, mr. Haji.

179
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,781
What are you saying?

180
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:52,113
If i go to the market today...
- yes?

181
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:54,692
Anyone will pay me rs.
7000 for it, willingly.

182
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:59,629
But, mr. Haji, you never
go out of the village.

183
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,160
And i know why.

184
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:04,165
Stop your nonsense or
i'll give you a tight slap.

185
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:08,096
Come on, give me rs. 5000.
You'll always remember me.

186
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:11,171
Here, count them.
- Is it the complete amount?

187
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:19,850
Haji, i saw it.

188
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:22,744
What did you see?
- Sister-in-law.

189
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,013
I'll slap you.

190
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:29,027
I'll throw chillies in your eyes
if you even glance at my wife.

191
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:31,592
Come on, take the cow
and go from here. - Yes.

192
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:33,091
The old man has become angry.

193
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:36,801
Come on, darling.

194
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,636
Listen.
- Tell me, honey.

195
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:51,440
I was thinking, shall we
go to the shore of the lake?

196
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:53,916
The festival of 'eid'
(islamic festival) is due, too.

197
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:56,450
You get to see the
beautiful scenery from there.

198
00:14:56,822 --> 00:15:00,451
You also see a rainbow
during the monsoon season there.

199
00:15:01,227 --> 00:15:03,058
But what do you lack here?

200
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,821
Don't i take care of you nicely?
- Yes.

201
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,663
Don't i take you for a ride in
my car twice a month? - Yes.

202
00:15:09,735 --> 00:15:11,635
Don't i feed you good food?
- But...

203
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,797
we are not lovers that we
will hold each other's hands...

204
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:15,271
...and roam near the
shore of the lake.

205
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:18,837
But i am tired of sitting
at home and watching tv.

206
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:22,046
I've heard that nowadays,
along with running the household...

207
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:24,116
...the girls take up
reputed jobs, too.

208
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:28,284
And some even drive
the cars. And you are...

209
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:32,323
just because you
have studied a little...

210
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:34,186
...now you also
want to take up a job?

211
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:37,528
You want to drive a car, too?

212
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:45,567
I think i'll have to
stop her from watching tv.

213
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,700
Please don't do this.

214
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:55,640
I had taken my first wife
for an outing to darjeeling.

215
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:59,877
She ran away with some
bengali guide there.

216
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:04,251
I took my second wife to
watch a film in the city...

217
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:05,813
...for the first time in my life.

218
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,388
She liked the cinema so much
that she ran away to mumbai...

219
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,360
...from there itself
to become a heroine.

220
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:16,060
Why? Don't you trust me at all?

221
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:20,130
Annapyari, i trust
you a thousand times.

222
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,538
I trust you a thousand times.

223
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:28,006
But i am scared of my destiny.
Understood?

224
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:31,348
Except shankar whom you
call as your brother...

225
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:32,812
...i'll save you from
the wicked eye of...

226
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:35,080
...all the villagers for lifetime.

227
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:38,145
As for the rainbow, don't worry.

228
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:40,488
I'll put up a big
photo in your room...

229
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:42,584
...then watch the
rainbow daily. Okay?

230
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:45,789
No need. Go, i don't
want to speak to you.

231
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:49,196
"Hail bhagwati."

232
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:51,334
"Hail bhagwati."

233
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:53,166
"Hail bhagwati."

234
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,203
Child, mother is pleased.

235
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:01,338
All your desires will be fulfilled.

236
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:03,210
You are great,
bholenath. I am blessed.

237
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:06,445
You are really great. You
have reached... the high.

238
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:07,644
Hail bhagwati.

239
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:10,014
Hail bhagwati.

240
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:11,781
Hail bhagwati.

241
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:18,158
Hail bhagwati.

242
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:30,739
Here, headman. Tie one more thread,
the veneration will be completed.

243
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,902
One more thread?
- Yes. And it will cost extra.

244
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,705
Bholenath, you are so greedy.

245
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:37,442
Take this. How many
times should i give?

246
00:17:37,783 --> 00:17:39,341
Okay, i'll tie the thread after all.

247
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:42,983
Tell me one thing. Does
this thread possess any power?

248
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,281
Will my work be done?
- Do you know your age?

249
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:47,256
Headman! Headman!
- Yes?

250
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:48,992
Shankar's father has expired.
- What?

251
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:50,460
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

252
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,554
Where are you going?
- To tell haji.

253
00:17:52,665 --> 00:17:54,132
All right. Do one thing.
- Yes?

254
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,667
You tie this thread. I
will go and see. Oh, god.

255
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,431
Do one thing. Tie this thread.
I will go and see.

256
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,971
Brother shankar. Brother shankar.
- Yes?

257
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:07,771
Father has expired.

258
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,974
What? I met your
father on the way just now.

259
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:14,209
Not my father, but yours.
- What? Oh, god!

260
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:19,248
Come on, darling, i'll
show you the village. Come on.

261
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:20,884
Brother, what happened?

262
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,089
Goldsmith bhaskar is no more.
- Oh, god!

263
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:29,661
Shankar, wait. Shankar, stop.
I'm coming. Stop.

264
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:42,910
Father! Father!
- Oh, god!

265
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:44,911
Come on, don't crowd here.

266
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:47,618
Let the dead body get
some pure air. - Yes.

267
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:49,449
Who can avoid the mishap?

268
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:52,988
Arrange for the logs.
Inform the cemetery authorities.

269
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:58,491
Shankar, don't keep him on the
bed for long. Bring him down.

270
00:18:58,697 --> 00:19:00,062
Come on. Come on.

271
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:02,532
My stars are really unlucky today.
- Yes.

272
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:04,558
I think many people will come.

273
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:09,530
I should also go and arrange
for tea. - Yes. You will have to.

274
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:13,902
Oh, father.

275
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,029
Tell everyone to run away from here.

276
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:43,100
Hey, stop weeping and mourning.

277
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:46,603
Save a little for father's death.
- What?

278
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:48,237
What's going on?

279
00:19:48,747 --> 00:19:54,549
Hail bhagwati. Bhagwati
had told me that it's a lie.

280
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,349
But you villagers are too much.

281
00:19:57,022 --> 00:20:00,514
Anju, your throat will be
parched if you weep so loudly.

282
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:03,656
Hey? Where are you going?

283
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:08,465
Actually bhaskar had dozed
off into deep slumber. - Right.

284
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,637
Oh, my god! Where is my cow?
Cow, i am coming.

285
00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:14,103
Come on, let's go.
Everyone leave. Let's go.

286
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,504
Yes, let's go. Come on.
- Let's go.

287
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:17,166
Come on. Come on.
- Let's go, dear.

288
00:20:17,242 --> 00:20:18,834
Shankar, one minute.

289
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:25,146
If your father
really dies, then call me.

290
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:29,051
I'll come immediately and perform
his funeral rites accordingly.

291
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:31,816
No. Whenever he dies.
I am with you.

292
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,817
Very good.

293
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,494
Shankar's father is unpredictable.

294
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:41,825
What will shankar do?

295
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:44,733
Hey, what's wrong with atmaram?
- Come on.

296
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,374
Hey, it's a cow. A cow!

297
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:51,636
Why, atmaram?

298
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:55,610
You gave rs. 101 to that
great astrologer daya shastri...

299
00:20:55,681 --> 00:20:57,012
...and spoiled your future.

300
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:59,949
I had already told him to learn
the cow's future from me. But no.

301
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:03,679
Bholenath, should i squander
more for a cow worth rs. 5000?

302
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:05,248
Then die here.

303
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:10,226
Make that sound. What's that sound?

304
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:20,230
Shut up!

305
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:41,759
What can anyone do
before god's wish?

306
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:47,999
The people have not come yet?

307
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:14,021
He was such a good man.

308
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:20,459
Oh, no.

309
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,435
I am doomed.

310
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:32,741
You have designed it perfectly,
but don't you think...

311
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:35,769
...the fees rs. 482
is too exorbitant?

312
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:43,313
If you think so... i can
reduce rs. 2 only for you.

313
00:22:44,423 --> 00:22:46,857
But i won't take a rupee
less than that. - Oh, it is...

314
00:22:50,128 --> 00:22:51,652
how did you like it?
- Good. Good.

315
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,822
Thank you. Thank you.

316
00:22:53,699 --> 00:22:55,633
It would have been
great if you made...

317
00:22:55,734 --> 00:22:57,224
...the new design which
is in fashion nowadays.

318
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:58,428
Which design?

319
00:22:58,537 --> 00:23:04,669
That round one.
- Yes, like this.

320
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:07,203
Like this, sonu?
- Yes.

321
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:09,514
It is exactly like my design.

322
00:23:10,048 --> 00:23:15,281
It is round and it has small dots,
i've this design, too.

323
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,653
And i've a design which... it
is very famous in south. - Yes.

324
00:23:20,826 --> 00:23:25,195
Look at this. It is long here and
then it becomes round down here...

325
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:28,528
enough. Enough. I don't want
the long or the round design.

326
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,100
The one which you
have made is perfect.

327
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:34,366
Shankar, now you go home,
i'll send your fees there. Okay?

328
00:23:34,506 --> 00:23:39,409
How can he? At least have
food and go. - All right.

329
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:42,843
He doesn't have time to eat. He
is so busy. - Yes, that's true.

330
00:23:42,948 --> 00:23:45,314
He has a lot of work
at home. Right, shankar?

331
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:49,418
Well, it is not so.

332
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:52,657
Oh, shankar, you have come?
- Yes.

333
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,815
You have made the earrings.
- Yes.

334
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:56,860
Oh, they are so beautiful.
- Yes.

335
00:23:56,962 --> 00:24:00,125
Shankar, i want to get
my old wedding necklace...

336
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:01,761
...designed into a new one.

337
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,958
Really?
- This one.

338
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:05,501
If you can get me melted and
make a new one, then do that, too.

339
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:08,264
What nonsense!
- No, mr. Shastri is just joking.

340
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:11,337
If you listen to me, it's no use of
redesigning your wedding necklace.

341
00:24:11,476 --> 00:24:12,841
The gold is reduced.
- Yes.

342
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:15,310
It's better to buy a new one.
- Oh, yes.

343
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:16,904
Shankar is right.
- Yes.

344
00:24:16,982 --> 00:24:18,176
Why should we reduce the gold?
- Yes.

345
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,610
Come on, you both go inside now.

346
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:23,445
Come on.

347
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,526
Shankar, these mother and
daughter are crazy after gold.

348
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:33,726
They want to wear gold in their
ears, feet, nose and everywhere.

349
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:38,094
Have you finished laughing,
shankar? - Yes.

350
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:41,572
Then you may go. I'll
call you if i need you.

351
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,300
Goodbye.

352
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:49,207
Carefully. Slowly.

353
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:52,074
Give here.

354
00:24:57,656 --> 00:24:58,714
Papa, you are too much.

355
00:24:58,857 --> 00:25:01,451
You say anything to
mother before shankar. - Yes.

356
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:04,286
Are you worried about
your mother or shankar?

357
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,358
I am an astrologer. I
know everyone's future.

358
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:12,534
Don't i know what was
going on in your mind?

359
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,170
He was making the
round on your hand...

360
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:18,174
...by calling you 'sonu'
and you were feeling elated.

361
00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:19,771
Can't i see that?

362
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:24,413
Forget whatever you have
in your heart quickly...

363
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,880
...otherwise you will repent later.

364
00:25:28,587 --> 00:25:31,055
Have you seen ravi's photo?
- No.

365
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:37,454
If you have not seen it then
see and choose him, too. Got it?

366
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,061
You please keep quiet.

367
00:25:39,698 --> 00:25:42,326
My daughter knows
what's good for her.

368
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:43,863
Why are you scolding her so much?

369
00:25:43,969 --> 00:25:46,961
I'll thrash you both so much
that you'll come to your senses.

370
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:48,197
What's wrong with you?

371
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:50,632
They are too much. - I wonder what
happens to him from time to time.

372
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:51,834
What happened?

373
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:54,571
I spoke a little to
shankar and papa got angry.

374
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,408
Oh, such a trifle matter?
- Yes.

375
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:57,639
Don't pay attention to him.

376
00:25:57,883 --> 00:25:59,817
Look, you talk to him.

377
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:02,579
What's the harm in
talking to your neighbor?

378
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,712
Come on, wear the other
earring and show me. Show me.

379
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,592
It suits me, doesn't it?
- Yes, it suits you.

380
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:41,451
Don't do this. What if
anyone spots you at this hour?

381
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:42,644
Let him see me.

382
00:27:42,821 --> 00:27:45,654
It's better. It will become
easy if someone spots us at night.

383
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,058
By the way, what were you doing?

384
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:51,591
I was looking at our
photo which we had...

385
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:54,188
...clicked together at the
fair last year. Do you remember?

386
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:56,391
Of course. How can i forget it?

387
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:58,692
I have a photo, too.

388
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:01,104
I have just seen it.

389
00:28:02,007 --> 00:28:03,975
By the way, papa has some doubts.

390
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:09,670
Don't worry about it. I
will melt him in a jiffy.

391
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,262
What's wrong, papa?

392
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:50,050
Do you smoke a cigar?
- A cigar? Not at all.

393
00:28:50,622 --> 00:28:51,680
Give a puff.

394
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:55,487
Not at all?
- No.

395
00:28:57,062 --> 00:28:59,189
Oh, what's wrong?

396
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:01,195
What's the matter? Why
have you woke up suvarna...

397
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:02,960
...from her sleep at this hour?

398
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:05,365
Mother, look. Papa thinks i smoke.

399
00:29:05,937 --> 00:29:07,165
What?
- Yes.

400
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:10,673
She doesn't smokes, but i do.

401
00:29:11,242 --> 00:29:13,506
So you have come to spy
on your daughter at night?

402
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,502
I am fed up with this man.

403
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:17,005
Come on, let's go to sleep.

404
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:19,441
Come to sleep.

405
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:48,568
I am not such a great donator,
but for the sake of my daughter...

406
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:52,275
...i'm ready to give not only
half 'tola', but 10 'tolas', too.

407
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:57,947
You are great, bhagwati.

408
00:29:58,723 --> 00:30:01,692
Actually i had said 10
'tolas' in excitement.

409
00:30:02,327 --> 00:30:03,919
Don't consider it true.

410
00:30:05,597 --> 00:30:09,966
I will get one gold string
and five beads added to it.

411
00:30:10,802 --> 00:30:12,201
But i have a request.

412
00:30:12,904 --> 00:30:16,772
When you meet bhagwati,
tell her that my daughter's...

413
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:18,399
...wedding should be
solemnized with such grandeur...

414
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:20,238
...that the entire village
should be jealous. - Okay.

415
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:23,337
And only ashes should be
found in my neighbor's house.

416
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:26,212
Abracadabra... - yes, the
wedding should take place...

417
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:27,808
...as soon as possible.
- Okay.

418
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,853
Abracadabra...
- listen. With that boy from dubai.

419
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:31,916
Yes. That, too, with
that boy from dubai.

420
00:30:33,358 --> 00:30:35,451
Isn't it too much, mr. Shastri?

421
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:38,327
Dubai? Isn't it enough
that she gets married?

422
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:39,722
It's not enough.

423
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:45,128
All right. Shastri, think that
your prayers have reached bhagwati.

424
00:30:45,236 --> 00:30:49,673
Join your hands.
- Abracadabra.

425
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,475
Headman, shall i serve
you hot 'samosas' (snacks)?

426
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:01,016
No, not now.
- Not now?

427
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:03,110
I'll take them for my
children at night. - Okay.

428
00:31:03,254 --> 00:31:05,119
Make them piping hot.
- Sure.

429
00:31:05,256 --> 00:31:09,056
Read the paper and tell me if
anyone is selling goats nearby.

430
00:31:09,627 --> 00:31:10,719
Goats?
- Yes.

431
00:31:10,895 --> 00:31:12,658
You will get many goats.

432
00:31:12,897 --> 00:31:14,865
Atmaram.
- Yes? - tell me something.

433
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:17,200
Just because your cow has run away...

434
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:18,963
...will you start selling goats now?

435
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:22,540
Headman, i will sell the
goats from today. - But why?

436
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:28,941
Because i know one day my
cow will come running to me.

437
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:34,412
Look here.

438
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:46,552
What a shame! What times have come!

439
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:50,431
There is no morality or shame.
- What is he saying?

440
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:54,231
There are many chutney and
'samosa' makers in this village...

441
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:58,867
...who give a smile to
such indecent women.

442
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,601
This is the curse of our village.

443
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:04,604
Let the next meeting of the
village council take place.

444
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:07,181
If i don't drive them
away from the village...

445
00:32:07,252 --> 00:32:10,779
...sprinkle the holy water
and make the village sacred...

446
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,289
...then don't call me the headman,
but a donkey.

447
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:31,103
Listen. Did you pray
for suvarna today? - Yes.

448
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:33,472
Whether it is
suvarna or anyone else...

449
00:32:34,212 --> 00:32:37,739
...it is useless to pray for anyone
in these contemporary times.

450
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,084
You know that shastri...
- quiet.

451
00:32:42,387 --> 00:32:45,220
He wanted me to offer the
veneration to break the love...

452
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:49,727
...which is going on
between suvarna and shankar.

453
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:53,356
But tell me something, dear.

454
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:57,524
Why should i become an
obstacle between two lovers?

455
00:32:58,036 --> 00:32:59,128
You are right.

456
00:32:59,671 --> 00:33:03,368
You shouldn't hurt
two lovers. Right?

457
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:09,973
And we shouldn't
delay in loving, too.

458
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:11,239
Come on, darling.

459
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:16,177
Oh, bhagwati, who has come
at this hour? - Please wait.

460
00:33:19,824 --> 00:33:22,292
Oh, you? What does it contain?

461
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:26,085
'Samosas'. You love them, right?

462
00:33:26,197 --> 00:33:28,722
I've got them made hot
for you. Let's go in.

463
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:30,564
I am in a hurry today.

464
00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:32,565
Hey, bhagwati!

465
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:38,840
Headman, you?

466
00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:44,213
I felt on hearing the knock
that someone is very impatient.

467
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:45,510
Someone is in a hurry.

468
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,515
Honestly speaking, i
had come to meet you.

469
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:49,279
Really?
- Yes. - do i stay here?

470
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,218
No. I thought that you stay here.
- Forget it.

471
00:33:52,624 --> 00:33:53,921
Tell me what's wrong.

472
00:33:54,058 --> 00:33:56,026
No, no. We'll talk tomorrow.

473
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:58,028
Why tomorrow? I am
standing before you.

474
00:33:58,096 --> 00:34:00,428
Sit. We'll talk right now.
- No, i am going.

475
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:02,226
There is a possibility of rain.
- Okay.

476
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:03,561
Right? I am going.
- One minute.

477
00:34:03,968 --> 00:34:05,936
The 'samosas' will get
drenched in the rain.

478
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,501
Give it to her.
- Yes.

479
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:09,699
Yes, take them. Eat them, okay?

480
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:13,434
We will eat them, okay?
- Wretched guy.

481
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:15,039
Come on, let's eat it.

482
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,986
Hail mother bhagwati.
- I seek your blessings.

483
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:26,182
You will become a big
man when you grow up.

484
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,656
Pay me rs. 20.
- Please take rs. 15.

485
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:29,192
You had paid me rs.
15 last time, too.

486
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,818
You don't know my fury.

487
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:32,863
Forget your fury.
- Let me take rs. 15 at least.

488
00:34:33,264 --> 00:34:34,322
What are you doing?

489
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:36,092
You made someone else
design gold on your sword?

490
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:39,359
Forget about this gold now.
- How can i forget the gold?

491
00:34:39,604 --> 00:34:40,798
Forget about gold
and think about sonu.

492
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:41,963
What should i think about her?

493
00:34:42,106 --> 00:34:44,631
Think about sonu's wedding because
shastri is thinking about it.

494
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,575
They are fixing her
proposal with some boy.

495
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:49,977
I have heard the boy is from dubai.

496
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:52,807
But her wedding is
not fixed yet, right?

497
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:54,815
Hey, bhagwati!

498
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,015
Shankar, the wedding
is not fixed yet...

499
00:34:57,088 --> 00:34:58,680
...but it will be fixed soon.

500
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:02,924
I say never delay in
the matter of love.

501
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:05,226
If you love each other,
then hold the girl's hand...

502
00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:06,662
...bring her here and get married.

503
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:08,059
We villagers will handle the rest.

504
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:13,070
But yes, shankar, she
should come when you call her...

505
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:15,766
...or you will become the
laughing stock of the village.

506
00:35:22,714 --> 00:35:24,306
I was going to tell you.

507
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:27,608
What's my fault if
bholenath told you before that?

508
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:29,944
I have told you whatever i
had in my heart very frankly.

509
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:34,182
I can't bear to see if
anyone else marries you.

510
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,190
I will also be unable to
bear if someone else...

511
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,694
...comes in my life except you.

512
00:35:40,665 --> 00:35:42,189
But what if i have to say yes
to the proposal from dubai...

513
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,666
...under the pressure of my parents?

514
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:53,811
Look, i already know that we
can't get married that easily.

515
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,439
Then what should we do?

516
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:04,321
There is one way.
- Which one?

517
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:09,293
The way is difficult, but...
- tell me the way.

518
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:16,962
If you have guts, then
make a gold wedding necklace...

519
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:18,433
...and put it round my neck.

520
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,163
Then no one will
be able to touch me.

521
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,303
Are you telling the truth?

522
00:36:25,176 --> 00:36:29,044
Yes. If my parents see,
they will be shocked.

523
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,945
They will thrash me, too.

524
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:33,608
But you don't worry
about it. I will bear it.

525
00:36:34,752 --> 00:36:38,483
Sonu, you have the guts for this?

526
00:36:39,457 --> 00:36:41,049
I had never imagined.

527
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:47,559
Whatever it is, papa will be
happy later on looking at the gold.

528
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,960
But the gold should
be worth pleasing him.

529
00:36:51,269 --> 00:36:52,736
It is the matter of one necklace.

530
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,964
It needs one 'tola' of gold,
i'll make it in a jiffy.

531
00:36:55,106 --> 00:36:56,937
Enough. If you give
one 'tola' of gold...

532
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:58,100
...we can never get married.

533
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,209
You will have to give a sacrifice
of at least 10 'tolas' of gold...

534
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:02,871
...to please papa.

535
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:04,072
Ten 'tolas'?

536
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:06,580
Do you know what the
price of ten 'tolas' is?

537
00:37:07,552 --> 00:37:09,645
You always keep on
complaining about poverty.

538
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:12,015
I knew that you can't do anything.

539
00:37:12,557 --> 00:37:15,025
I don't think i'll ever be
able to get married to you.

540
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:19,828
I wanted to present you
as a rich man before papa.

541
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:23,164
But you will never remove
gold for me from your locker.

542
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,202
You are so foolish that
you don't understand...

543
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:31,341
...we will get all the jewelery
back to us after our marriage.

544
00:37:31,742 --> 00:37:34,506
Then whatever we will get from papa
will be over and above the same.

545
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,948
But i have a doubt.

546
00:37:38,816 --> 00:37:41,182
What's the guarantee
that we will be successful...

547
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:45,052
...even after i give a
necklace worth ten 'tolas'?

548
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:47,691
You are talking like
a goldsmith again.

549
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:51,820
The base of love, marriage
and relationships is trust.

550
00:37:51,963 --> 00:37:54,090
The entire world is based on trust.

551
00:37:54,532 --> 00:37:58,468
And think, when i'll wear the
wedding necklace made by you...

552
00:37:58,536 --> 00:38:03,098
...and shout aloud that my love,
my shankar has given it to me...

553
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:06,771
...then just watch, the world will
accept our relationship quickly.

554
00:38:08,212 --> 00:38:09,304
All right.

555
00:38:10,147 --> 00:38:12,138
Now i'll make a
necklace of ten 'tolas'...

556
00:38:13,184 --> 00:38:14,617
...only for you.

557
00:38:44,415 --> 00:38:47,407
"I'll gift a red drape."

558
00:38:49,987 --> 00:38:52,979
"I'll gift a red drape."

559
00:38:55,493 --> 00:39:00,726
"The clay of the potter
and gold of the goldsmith."

560
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:06,732
"I am counting the days of wait."

561
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:09,669
"I'll gift a red drape."

562
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:15,203
"I'll gift a red drape."

563
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:23,251
"The clay of the potter
and gold of the goldsmith."

564
00:39:42,974 --> 00:39:48,606
"I have to spend the
moments slowly and carefully."

565
00:39:48,746 --> 00:39:53,683
"I have to improve the
lines of my destiny."

566
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:59,589
"I have to spend the
moments slowly and carefully."

567
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:03,490
"I have to weigh it
accurately and precisely."

568
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:06,791
"I have to weigh it
accurately and precisely."

569
00:40:06,931 --> 00:40:10,389
"I've to open the facts enclosed
in my eyes with the lashes."

570
00:40:10,568 --> 00:40:18,100
"I've to open the facts enclosed
in my eyes with the lashes."

571
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:23,545
"The pomegranate seed
is in the red fire."

572
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:24,876
"The pomegranate seed."

573
00:40:26,317 --> 00:40:28,979
"I'll gift a red drape."

574
00:40:29,086 --> 00:40:35,082
"The clay of the potter
and gold of the goldsmith."

575
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:03,045
Bholenath. Bholenath.
- Yes?

576
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,849
The matter is going to be serious.

577
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,054
Suvarna has
decided to elope with me.

578
00:41:09,193 --> 00:41:10,524
Are you sure that she will come?

579
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:14,323
I'm sure? Now she won't stop
even if shastri stops her.

580
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:18,562
Shankar, one girl
had promised me, too.

581
00:41:18,703 --> 00:41:19,795
But she never came.

582
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:22,498
And i've become
bholenath because of her.

583
00:41:22,707 --> 00:41:24,197
And i don't want
any other bholenath...

584
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:25,969
...to dance in this
village in my presence. Got it?

585
00:41:26,077 --> 00:41:27,806
You will always be an idiot.

586
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,444
What do you think of me?

587
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:31,547
I have made confirmed arrangements.

588
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:33,716
I am a man after all.

589
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:36,916
What? You have made her...

590
00:41:37,254 --> 00:41:41,020
what a shame! That is a dirty way.

591
00:41:41,659 --> 00:41:42,853
I am a man.

592
00:41:45,563 --> 00:41:47,497
What? You have married her?

593
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:48,792
I'll marry her soon.
- Really?

594
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:50,230
I just want your support.

595
00:41:50,367 --> 00:41:53,234
Of course, shankar, i am with you.
- That's it.

596
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:59,303
"There are no diamonds and
emeralds studded on it."

597
00:41:59,443 --> 00:42:04,039
"The queen of the
village will sleep in gold."

598
00:42:04,882 --> 00:42:09,751
"There are no diamonds and
emeralds studded on it."

599
00:42:09,854 --> 00:42:14,223
"I've spent the
monsoon in your memories."

600
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:17,294
"I've collected the
raindrops in the pot."

601
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:24,265
"I've collected the
raindrops in the pot."

602
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:28,530
"It moves in inches."

603
00:42:29,206 --> 00:42:33,666
"The wheel of time moves in inches."

604
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:35,073
"The wheel of time."

605
00:42:35,212 --> 00:42:39,649
"The clay of the potter
and gold of the goldsmith."

606
00:42:39,784 --> 00:42:44,983
"I have to spend the
moments slowly and carefully."

607
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:47,853
"I'll gift a red drape."

608
00:42:50,628 --> 00:42:53,563
"I'll gift a red drape."

609
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:59,125
"I'll gift a red drape."

610
00:43:01,806 --> 00:43:04,775
"I'll gift a red drape."

611
00:43:07,244 --> 00:43:10,213
"I'll gift a red drape."

612
00:43:18,656 --> 00:43:19,714
Ten 'tolas'.

613
00:43:20,825 --> 00:43:24,056
Not a 'tola' less,
not a 'tola' more.

614
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:33,202
Anyway, i've also added the gold...

615
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:35,329
...we had saved for
anju's wedding to it.

616
00:43:36,006 --> 00:43:38,406
I'll get back the gold
after our wedding, right?

617
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:44,074
And anju will be the
happiest for our wedding, right?

618
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:51,217
You shouldn't have added
anju's share of gold...

619
00:43:51,288 --> 00:43:53,552
...to this wedding necklace.

620
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:56,316
Don't say this, sonu.

621
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:58,558
I am her brother.

622
00:43:59,396 --> 00:44:00,988
If i have borrowed gold from her...

623
00:44:01,565 --> 00:44:03,829
...then i'll give her
double in her wedding.

624
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:36,089
Give me, dear. Give here. Give
it to me. You go inside. Go.

625
00:44:40,204 --> 00:44:44,231
Listen. Don't hurt her
by asking useless things.

626
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:47,810
She has told me everything.
Be quiet.

627
00:44:49,213 --> 00:44:53,616
Hail lord shiva (indian god).

628
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:58,086
Hail lord shiva (indian god).

629
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:05,085
Dear, did shankar do anything
else besides giving this necklace?

630
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:06,253
No, mother.

631
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:09,055
I knew it. He is a
boy with great values.

632
00:45:09,566 --> 00:45:10,897
He will never do such a thing.

633
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:15,070
By the way, this necklace
weighs ten 'tolas', right?

634
00:45:15,572 --> 00:45:16,664
Yes, mother.

635
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:22,543
It is ten 'tolas' in all.

636
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:28,948
Dear, keep this necklace
as an elder brother's love.

637
00:45:29,987 --> 00:45:34,048
He donated you something and
you accepted it with respect.

638
00:45:34,191 --> 00:45:35,249
That's it.

639
00:45:37,461 --> 00:45:41,261
Dear, this astrologer can
read the lines of your destiny...

640
00:45:41,332 --> 00:45:45,098
...and say that you are
destined to go to dubai.

641
00:45:45,736 --> 00:45:48,102
It is useless to try
to get shankar.

642
00:45:49,707 --> 00:45:53,074
He can't give you
anything except a necklace.

643
00:45:55,746 --> 00:45:57,577
By the way, you are already wise.

644
00:46:02,252 --> 00:46:03,378
Come on.

645
00:46:11,428 --> 00:46:13,089
Oh, it's an earthquake!

646
00:46:13,364 --> 00:46:14,922
It is that girl's earthquake.

647
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,099
She is kicking from upstairs.

648
00:46:17,368 --> 00:46:20,667
There is no way for me to kick
her like this from down here.

649
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:22,165
Tell me.

650
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:29,944
How are you, headman?

651
00:46:30,014 --> 00:46:32,073
Oh, shastri. Please come.

652
00:46:32,182 --> 00:46:34,582
Abdul, give one tea and biscuits.
- Sure.

653
00:46:37,187 --> 00:46:40,054
The dance is going on
in full spirits. - Yes.

654
00:46:42,393 --> 00:46:44,258
Now this place will turn
into ruins in some time.

655
00:46:44,595 --> 00:46:45,721
Then it will be fun.

656
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:47,362
Let it turn into ruins.

657
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,035
The thing which breaks by a
woman's feet is auspicious.

658
00:46:53,037 --> 00:46:57,167
Well said, shastri. You
seem to be very happy today.

659
00:46:57,241 --> 00:47:00,210
Yes. Why shouldn't i rejoice?
- Yes.

660
00:47:00,744 --> 00:47:02,871
I had only two desires in my life.

661
00:47:03,247 --> 00:47:06,580
One was to marry my
daughter with some boy from dubai.

662
00:47:07,351 --> 00:47:10,582
I can see it being fulfilled soon.
- I see.

663
00:47:10,654 --> 00:47:13,054
And no one has any
idea of the second one.

664
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:17,421
That is to make a necklace
worth ten 'tolas' for my daughter.

665
00:47:18,796 --> 00:47:21,629
I've fulfilled my
second desire too today.

666
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,455
Really? How?

667
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,033
Fantastic!
- How did you like the necklace?

668
00:47:33,243 --> 00:47:35,609
It is so big, isn't it?

669
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:38,804
Look.
- Give it to me.

670
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:43,782
It seems to be of 15 'tolas'.
Right, shankar?

671
00:47:45,055 --> 00:47:46,386
It weighs ten 'tolas'.

672
00:47:47,624 --> 00:47:50,218
Neither a 'tola' less, nor more.

673
00:47:50,294 --> 00:47:52,956
Very good, shastri.
It weighs ten 'tolas'.

674
00:47:53,764 --> 00:47:55,527
It glitters so brightly.
- Yes.

675
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,362
Take it, brother.
- Give here.

676
00:47:59,036 --> 00:48:02,130
Honestly speaking, i
wanted to get it made by you.

677
00:48:02,439 --> 00:48:04,339
But on suvarna's telling,
i got it made...

678
00:48:04,408 --> 00:48:06,273
...by the goldsmith
of laxmi's village.

679
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:11,147
The boy from dubai is
going to come to see suvarna...

680
00:48:11,215 --> 00:48:12,773
...in three-four days.

681
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:15,017
I have to make many preparations.

682
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,783
Shankar, please come here.

683
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:26,055
Go, shankar. Go.
- Go.

684
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:30,299
What is shastri saying?

685
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:32,995
A son-in-law from dubai? A
necklace of ten 'tolas'?

686
00:48:35,873 --> 00:48:38,205
The proposal doesn't
get fixed nowadays...

687
00:48:38,308 --> 00:48:40,503
...by just giving a
necklace of ten 'tolas'.

688
00:48:41,311 --> 00:48:43,905
I've heard the goldsmith is in
great demand in foreign countries.

689
00:48:45,415 --> 00:48:50,478
I'll tell suvarna to find a good
job for you after her wedding.

690
00:48:57,628 --> 00:49:00,188
Shastri! Stop!

691
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:02,524
Stop!

692
00:49:03,267 --> 00:49:06,031
Wretched man! - No,
shankar. No. What are you doing?

693
00:49:06,103 --> 00:49:07,695
Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

694
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:10,968
Stop it, shankar.
Don't hit me, shankar.

695
00:49:12,276 --> 00:49:14,335
Shankar, what's wrong?

696
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:16,402
What happened? Take care of him.
- Shankar. Shankar.

697
00:49:16,513 --> 00:49:18,071
What has happened to you?
- What's wrong with you?

698
00:49:18,148 --> 00:49:20,173
What has happened to you?
- Shankar! Shankar!

699
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,979
Shankar? Bring water.

700
00:49:24,054 --> 00:49:25,851
What has happened to him?
- You go and dance.

701
00:49:25,956 --> 00:49:27,480
Understood? We will handle him.

702
00:49:31,895 --> 00:49:33,760
Keep lying. Don't get up.

703
00:49:33,864 --> 00:49:36,264
Let him sit. Let him get
some fresh breeze. - Right.

704
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:39,962
Get up.
- Get up. Yes, carefully. Slowly.

705
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:42,363
Does it always happen to him?

706
00:49:42,472 --> 00:49:43,905
I have never noticed it before.

707
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:46,302
I don't know. He was talking
with shastri and then he fainted.

708
00:49:46,376 --> 00:49:48,776
Yes, he is feeling giddy since
then. - Are you still feeling giddy?

709
00:49:49,313 --> 00:49:51,304
No, no. He would have
collapsed if he were feeling giddy.

710
00:50:22,246 --> 00:50:23,679
Laxmi. Laxmi.

711
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:26,278
Laxmi, he has jumped on this side.

712
00:50:26,383 --> 00:50:28,613
I've just heard it. Yes.

713
00:50:35,692 --> 00:50:39,321
Sona. Sona.

714
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,727
Suvarna. Suvarna.
- Suvarna.

715
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:46,928
Suvarna.
- Suvarna.

716
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:49,768
Su...
- he has come. - yes.

717
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,467
What's wrong, papa?
- He has come.

718
00:50:51,575 --> 00:50:53,372
You come.
- Come on. Come on.

719
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,146
We should catch him and
gather the entire village.

720
00:51:01,218 --> 00:51:02,446
You come first.

721
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:06,816
Come on. Come on.

722
00:51:07,124 --> 00:51:08,989
You must have dreamt about
yourself when you must have...

723
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:10,890
...jumped in someone's
house when you were young.

724
00:51:11,128 --> 00:51:12,595
I've heard the sound clearly.

725
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:14,527
I am sure he must
be somewhere around.

726
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:23,138
Oh, mother.

727
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:25,967
Why do you make us do
strange things at midnight?

728
00:51:26,043 --> 00:51:27,169
Have you gone crazy?

729
00:51:27,778 --> 00:51:28,938
Come on. Let's go to sleep.

730
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,277
Wait, i'm coming, too.

731
00:51:56,573 --> 00:51:58,666
Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

732
00:52:01,445 --> 00:52:02,503
Quiet.

733
00:52:04,815 --> 00:52:06,373
The intention of your
parents has changed...

734
00:52:07,351 --> 00:52:09,251
...as soon they got the
gold and the boy from dubai.

735
00:52:10,654 --> 00:52:17,526
But remember, i am
smarter than your father.

736
00:52:18,929 --> 00:52:20,556
But i...
- quiet.

737
00:52:21,331 --> 00:52:23,299
I feel like giving you a tight slap.

738
00:52:24,368 --> 00:52:28,202
But what should i do? I love you.

739
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:35,809
Okay, fine. Forget
whatever that happened.

740
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:38,906
Your foolish idea has failed.

741
00:52:39,816 --> 00:52:43,411
Tomorrow, i'll come to take
you before the entire village.

742
00:52:49,526 --> 00:52:50,686
Will you come, sonu?

743
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:55,321
Yes, i'll come.

744
00:52:55,932 --> 00:52:59,527
Now watch, how i teach a
lesson to your father.

745
00:53:01,405 --> 00:53:02,463
Watch it.

746
00:53:07,544 --> 00:53:09,739
I allowed you to enter
our house as a neighbor...

747
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:11,405
...but you have started
considering it as your own. - Yes.

748
00:53:12,015 --> 00:53:13,812
I have a name and
respect in the village...

749
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:16,014
...and you are ruining our respect?

750
00:53:16,653 --> 00:53:17,847
We are respectable people.

751
00:53:17,954 --> 00:53:20,616
We don't steal the gold of others
in disguise of designing it.

752
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,317
Mind your language, shastri.

753
00:53:23,026 --> 00:53:24,493
We goldsmiths are honest, too.

754
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:27,125
And our honesty is dear
to us than gold as well.

755
00:53:27,397 --> 00:53:29,661
Hey, bhagwati. What's
the use of fighting...

756
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:31,132
...like a snake and
mongoose like this?

757
00:53:31,468 --> 00:53:35,564
Shastri, call your daughter. We
will talk frankly. - Tell him.

758
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:37,732
Bholenath, don't try to
speak in favour of others...

759
00:53:37,808 --> 00:53:39,833
...while standing in my courtyard.

760
00:53:39,943 --> 00:53:41,171
This is my family matter.

761
00:53:42,779 --> 00:53:45,839
Shastri, it is not
your family matter.

762
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:48,180
Now it has become the matter
of the entire village. - Yes.

763
00:53:48,251 --> 00:53:51,118
Brother, come here. Don't fight.
- Shankar, come here.

764
00:53:51,221 --> 00:53:53,018
Daya, call your daughter.

765
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:58,489
She will say clearly as to who her
love, her world and her life is.

766
00:53:59,496 --> 00:54:00,929
And who has given the
wedding necklace to her.

767
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:03,397
What?
- What is this?

768
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,264
Wedding necklace?
Which wedding necklace?

769
00:54:06,336 --> 00:54:07,667
Of ten 'tolas'.

770
00:54:08,505 --> 00:54:10,700
That wedding necklace for
which i spent my lifetime...

771
00:54:10,774 --> 00:54:12,708
...earnings and made it for sonu.

772
00:54:14,411 --> 00:54:16,902
And she had told me that you
will accept this proposal...

773
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,743
...on seeing the gold.
- What?

774
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,648
Oh, my god! A gold necklace?!

775
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:27,220
Shankar, if you are my son
then return with the necklace.

776
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,518
Necklace? Which necklace?

777
00:54:29,192 --> 00:54:30,659
Hey, what are you saying?
What are you saying?

778
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:31,853
You have taken my gold necklace...

779
00:54:31,928 --> 00:54:34,260
i've given birth to suvarna.

780
00:54:34,331 --> 00:54:37,994
Listen to me.
- Hey, leave my hand.

781
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:39,534
Oh, god.

782
00:54:39,603 --> 00:54:41,230
Mother, calm down.

783
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:43,238
Hey, i'm telling you!

784
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:54,682
Mother, leave her.
- If you blame my daughter again...

785
00:54:59,289 --> 00:55:00,688
daya!

786
00:55:05,228 --> 00:55:06,855
Come on.
- You are a witch.

787
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,056
What is it, bhaskar?

788
00:55:09,866 --> 00:55:12,198
Wretched thief!
- Father!

789
00:55:13,169 --> 00:55:16,332
Shastri, what is this commotion?

790
00:55:16,406 --> 00:55:18,135
You have created havoc
in the entire village.

791
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:19,607
Everyone is watching your drama.

792
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:21,609
Headman, if you were in my place...

793
00:55:21,711 --> 00:55:22,837
...there would have
been bloodshed here.

794
00:55:22,946 --> 00:55:26,006
But... - if they love each other,
then call the girl and ask her.

795
00:55:26,082 --> 00:55:27,879
Yes. - We'll come to
know the truth right now.

796
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:29,611
You are right. - Yes, call her
and tell her to come with me.

797
00:55:29,953 --> 00:55:32,683
She had promised me while wearing
the wedding necklace. - Yes.

798
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:34,689
It won't do if you talk in riddles.

799
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:36,486
Everyone's time is being wasted.
- Yes.

800
00:55:36,593 --> 00:55:38,185
Where is she? Call her.
- The girl is mature.

801
00:55:38,261 --> 00:55:40,889
The entire village will believe
her talks seriously. - Yes.

802
00:55:40,964 --> 00:55:43,899
This matter won't be solved
without calling her. - Definitely.

803
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:48,336
Tell me. What do you
all want to hear? Yes?

804
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:56,342
Dear, we want to
hear the truth from you.

805
00:55:56,413 --> 00:55:59,610
Yes, we will consider
only what you say as true.

806
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:07,012
No one has given me
any wedding necklace...

807
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:09,490
...nor i made any
promise of love to anyone.

808
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,494
This is a lie and i am saying it.

809
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:14,162
Does everyone believe now?

810
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,107
Now no one has to worry about it.

811
00:56:29,446 --> 00:56:31,812
We are humans.
Let us live in peace.

812
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:39,288
Thief. Deceit.
- Calm down, dear.

813
00:56:39,389 --> 00:56:42,790
She made fake promises of
love to me and fooled me.

814
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,891
Wretched thief!
- Calm down, brother.

815
00:56:45,962 --> 00:56:47,896
Sonu!
- Shankar, calm down!

816
00:56:47,964 --> 00:56:50,899
The girl whose intention changes
by getting ten 'tolas' of gold...

817
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:52,525
...i don't want that girl.

818
00:56:52,602 --> 00:56:54,729
Shankar, relax. Let's go.
- Wretched thief.

819
00:56:54,804 --> 00:56:56,328
Come on, shankar. Let's go.
- Come on, shankar.

820
00:56:56,406 --> 00:56:58,135
Sonu!
- Let's go, shankar.

821
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:00,142
Come on, shankar.
- Let's go from here, shankar.

822
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,007
This is a family of thieves.

823
00:57:02,078 --> 00:57:04,842
Come on, shankar. Let's
go from here. - Let's go.

824
00:57:05,615 --> 00:57:07,776
This is a family of thieves.

825
00:57:07,851 --> 00:57:11,218
Let's go, shankar.
- She has deceived me.

826
00:57:12,889 --> 00:57:17,656
Let's go.
- She has cheated me badly.

827
00:57:32,308 --> 00:57:38,008
Shankar, forget whatever happened.

828
00:57:38,882 --> 00:57:41,009
They will definitely get the
punishment for their misdeeds.

829
00:57:42,085 --> 00:57:45,646
But it's better that you
are saved from those thieves.

830
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:52,284
But, shankar, what will
you do about your loss?

831
00:57:52,362 --> 00:57:56,696
Mother, don't hurt brother
more by asking such questions.

832
00:57:58,368 --> 00:58:00,700
Brother, don't worry at all.

833
00:58:01,237 --> 00:58:04,695
Just watch, god will
definitely find a way.

834
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:09,941
And if you have undergone any loss,
then you sell my gold.

835
00:58:51,254 --> 00:58:57,454
"What do i have to tell you now?"

836
00:58:57,527 --> 00:59:02,191
"What do i have to
hear from you now?"

837
00:59:03,366 --> 00:59:14,937
"Now i've given up seeing
dreams on moonlit nights."

838
00:59:15,211 --> 00:59:22,242
"Now i confess
everything to my ioneliness."

839
00:59:24,654 --> 00:59:28,146
"Whether you speak or not."

840
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,719
"Whether you speak or not."

841
00:59:36,933 --> 00:59:41,393
"Whether you speak or not."

842
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:50,777
"Whether you speak or not."

843
00:59:51,214 --> 00:59:59,644
"Whether you speak or not."

844
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:12,900
"When the moon asks me
at night how she looked..."

845
01:00:13,937 --> 01:00:20,604
"...i'll tell the moon
she looked like you to me."

846
01:00:21,611 --> 01:00:26,105
"It also has a demerit."

847
01:00:26,516 --> 01:00:29,383
"You, too, increase and reduce."

848
01:00:29,452 --> 01:00:32,546
"You come out sooner or later."

849
01:00:32,655 --> 01:00:40,084
"Your gold was never pure,
it was just like a coin."

850
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:52,007
"When you meet her, tell
her that it's not necessary...

851
01:00:52,442 --> 01:00:58,642
"...whether you speak or not."

852
01:00:58,715 --> 01:01:02,048
"Whether you speak or not."

853
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:07,420
"Whether you speak or not."

854
01:01:41,457 --> 01:01:48,226
"It is not my habit to
break any relationship."

855
01:01:49,032 --> 01:01:55,767
"My beloved had said this,
but deserted me on a turn."

856
01:01:57,073 --> 01:02:01,669
"A stranger is a
stranger after all."

857
01:02:01,878 --> 01:02:04,972
"She is wearing a
lot of jewelery."

858
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:07,846
"The jewelery of memory is new."

859
01:02:07,951 --> 01:02:10,977
"The pain which is not dissolved."

860
01:02:11,054 --> 01:02:15,923
"The colours which
can't be washed off."

861
01:02:16,392 --> 01:02:28,031
"There are still many complaints,
but i remember."

862
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:33,207
"Whether you speak or not."

863
01:02:35,445 --> 01:02:40,007
"Whether you speak or not."

864
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:47,887
"What do i have to tell you now?"

865
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:53,623
"What do i have to
hear from you now?"

866
01:02:54,364 --> 01:03:05,764
"Now i've given up seeing
dreams on moonlit nights."

867
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:12,743
"Now i confess
everything to my ioneliness."

868
01:03:13,783 --> 01:03:17,412
"Whether you speak or not."

869
01:03:20,023 --> 01:03:23,891
"Whether you speak or not."

870
01:03:24,994 --> 01:03:33,629
"Whether you speak or not."

871
01:03:34,337 --> 01:03:41,743
"Whether you speak or not."

872
01:03:41,811 --> 01:03:46,714
"Whether you speak or not."

873
01:03:49,185 --> 01:03:52,848
You know, i really
love your nose-ring.

874
01:03:54,223 --> 01:03:56,555
Honestly speaking, you should be
wearing on the other side, too.

875
01:03:58,027 --> 01:03:59,551
If you had got
married to a goldsmith...

876
01:03:59,629 --> 01:04:02,223
...perhaps he would have pierced
a ring on the other side, too.

877
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:05,934
But then you would have
missed this boy from dubai.

878
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:08,129
Am i right?

879
01:04:12,942 --> 01:04:14,773
I am going to dubai after one week.

880
01:04:15,344 --> 01:04:17,608
So what will you do
here alone without me?

881
01:04:18,014 --> 01:04:21,279
You know, i also have a great
desire to see the foreign land.

882
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:23,042
Why don't you take me along?

883
01:04:23,152 --> 01:04:26,383
I see. So you are more
eager to go to foreign...

884
01:04:26,456 --> 01:04:27,684
...than to stay with me?

885
01:04:28,224 --> 01:04:30,283
I will be bored here alone.

886
01:04:30,393 --> 01:04:32,088
Let me reach there first.

887
01:04:32,195 --> 01:04:34,686
Then i'll arrange for your
stay in a few months as well.

888
01:04:34,764 --> 01:04:36,959
Promise?
- Yes, promise.

889
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:41,302
But you will have to have patience
till then, sweetheart. - Yes.

890
01:04:43,806 --> 01:04:49,540
Hey, what's this? Why are you
wearing this pointed necklace?

891
01:04:49,745 --> 01:04:51,610
It hurts my chest.

892
01:04:53,616 --> 01:04:56,483
Doesn't your neck pain by
wearing it all the time?

893
01:04:56,886 --> 01:04:59,218
Look, it's so heavy. Of
how many 'tolas' is it?

894
01:04:59,956 --> 01:05:03,255
It weighs ten 'tolas'. Neither a
'tola' more, nor a 'tola' less.

895
01:05:03,326 --> 01:05:06,523
Papa has given it to me.
Please sit.

896
01:05:10,233 --> 01:05:12,701
I think your papa really loves you.

897
01:05:13,603 --> 01:05:16,128
Tell him not to lessen his
love after you get married.

898
01:05:16,205 --> 01:05:17,695
Keep on asking whatever you want.

899
01:05:17,773 --> 01:05:20,765
But please remove it right now.
I don't like these things.

900
01:05:20,843 --> 01:05:24,609
What? You don't like gold?
- No.

901
01:05:24,714 --> 01:05:28,775
What kind of man are you?
I won't remove it.

902
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:31,485
We have nearly reached. Come on.

903
01:05:32,255 --> 01:05:35,383
Today was my wedding night.
- What?

904
01:05:35,658 --> 01:05:37,125
My wedding night.

905
01:05:37,226 --> 01:05:39,023
Wretched girl!
- No, shankar.

906
01:05:39,095 --> 01:05:40,926
Witch.
- Hey, bhagwati. Shankar, stop.

907
01:05:40,997 --> 01:05:42,965
Cheat.
- Shankar, stop.

908
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,530
Deceit.
- Come on. Come on.

909
01:05:46,769 --> 01:05:48,396
Please come. We have
reached home. Come on. - Thief!

910
01:05:48,504 --> 01:05:52,133
No, shankar. Come on. No,
don't throw the stones. Don't.

911
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:55,405
Oh, no.
- Shastri, i am your unlucky stars.

912
01:05:55,478 --> 01:05:59,812
Shankar, come on. It is not that.
- Come out. Come out.

913
01:06:00,016 --> 01:06:01,449
He will come out
tomorrow morning. Come on.

914
01:06:01,517 --> 01:06:04,975
Your house is here. Come on,
we have reached your house.

915
01:06:05,221 --> 01:06:06,654
Come on, we have reached
your house. - Brother. Brother.

916
01:06:06,756 --> 01:06:08,587
Come on.
- I don't have any house.

917
01:06:08,858 --> 01:06:10,450
Shankar.
- Brother.

918
01:06:10,693 --> 01:06:12,558
Shankar, what's wrong?
What happened? - What's wrong?

919
01:06:12,662 --> 01:06:15,324
Bholenath, what's wrong with
shankar? Tell me, what's wrong?

920
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:17,296
Whatever was supposed to
happen has happened, mother.

921
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:18,958
Oh, god! - He is up to such
deeds because he has drunk...

922
01:06:19,068 --> 01:06:21,002
...for the first time.
- All this is because of you.

923
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:23,071
Pour two buckets of water
on his head. - Brother...

924
01:06:23,139 --> 01:06:24,197
hey?
- Hey, bhagwati.

925
01:06:24,307 --> 01:06:26,207
Sonu! - Come in. Come on.
- Brother, come inside.

926
01:06:28,144 --> 01:06:30,305
Why have you made me sit in
the rain? - Is it raining?

927
01:06:30,379 --> 01:06:31,539
Brother, come to your senses.
- I'm in my senses.

928
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:32,842
Why did you drink liquor?

929
01:06:33,883 --> 01:06:37,751
Look what condition that
wretch has made of yours.

930
01:06:42,725 --> 01:06:45,785
Brother, now go to sleep.
Go to sleep.

931
01:06:45,895 --> 01:06:47,726
Okay, i'm going to sleep.

932
01:06:48,464 --> 01:06:50,523
Okay, i'm going to sleep.

933
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:10,815
Son, forget whatever is gone.

934
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:17,658
Please don't drink in future. Okay?

935
01:07:19,695 --> 01:07:22,323
By the way, how much did you drink?

936
01:07:22,965 --> 01:07:27,129
Half a bottle. I couldn't bear it.

937
01:07:28,537 --> 01:07:32,940
But, son, you should
have left two pegs for me.

938
01:07:35,745 --> 01:07:37,770
You have not done a good thing.

939
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:51,787
If you are feeling so miserable,
why don't you take the...

940
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:56,525
...support of the police at
least to get back your necklace...

941
01:07:56,599 --> 01:07:58,157
...and prove your truth?

942
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:01,301
No need for it, bholenath.

943
01:08:03,339 --> 01:08:05,773
I am enduring the
punishment of my love.

944
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:09,207
Just watch, bholenath...

945
01:08:10,946 --> 01:08:13,540
...she will definitely get the
punishment of her disloyalty.

946
01:08:15,518 --> 01:08:17,645
The result of bad
deeds is never good.

947
01:08:18,187 --> 01:08:20,246
Hey, bhagwati, it's true.

948
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:24,388
But, brother shankar,
what's your intention?

949
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,025
What are you going to do?

950
01:08:26,529 --> 01:08:30,295
Wait. I'll just wait.

951
01:08:32,501 --> 01:08:36,904
I'll strike the hammer
when the iron is hot.

952
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:39,799
But how will this iron become hot?

953
01:08:40,309 --> 01:08:42,607
The iron will become hot,
bholenath.

954
01:08:44,814 --> 01:08:46,873
The time will make the iron hot.

955
01:08:49,552 --> 01:08:53,818
The goldsmith will just
strike with the hammer.

956
01:09:30,678 --> 01:09:33,647
Listen.
- Tell me, honey.

957
01:09:34,081 --> 01:09:37,073
I've heard that on the day
of suvarna lata's wedding...

958
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,245
...brother was sitting alone
at the sea shore and weeping?

959
01:09:40,688 --> 01:09:43,316
Grave injustice
has been done to him.

960
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:46,150
But i have full faith in him.

961
01:09:46,627 --> 01:09:48,527
He can never lie.

962
01:09:49,196 --> 01:09:51,061
I trust him as well, honey.

963
01:09:52,099 --> 01:09:56,126
But what can anyone
do in this matter?

964
01:09:58,072 --> 01:10:00,472
He didn't have any evidence to
prove his truth back then...

965
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:03,374
...nor does he now.

966
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:10,112
I say, the worst is over.

967
01:10:11,218 --> 01:10:15,245
Now shankar should forget everything
and concentrate on his work.

968
01:10:15,656 --> 01:10:16,816
Yes.

969
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,388
He has to get anju married, too.

970
01:10:19,927 --> 01:10:22,657
I've heard that
suvarna lata is pregnant.

971
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:26,358
Now she won't be able to
go to dubai to her husband.

972
01:10:27,034 --> 01:10:32,062
Poor brother. If he sits at
home and sees suvarna daily...

973
01:10:32,173 --> 01:10:33,834
...then he will feel more miserable.

974
01:10:34,975 --> 01:10:37,500
Why don't you help brother?

975
01:10:37,845 --> 01:10:39,244
I was also thinking...

976
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:45,949
...about it since a few days.

977
01:10:49,623 --> 01:10:54,788
A jewelery shop is
opening in the village.

978
01:10:54,862 --> 01:10:57,057
Shankar and sons.

979
01:10:57,164 --> 01:11:01,658
Get any design made of diamond,
emerald, gold or silver.

980
01:11:03,637 --> 01:11:04,695
Hello.

981
01:11:04,805 --> 01:11:06,295
You come, too.
- Okay.

982
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,335
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

983
01:11:08,442 --> 01:11:10,672
Girlfriend's design,
neighbor's design...

984
01:11:10,778 --> 01:11:14,373
...new fashion design,
everyone's design.

985
01:11:20,721 --> 01:11:27,923
Friend's design, enemy's design,
too. Everyone's design.

986
01:11:31,065 --> 01:11:32,191
Come on.

987
01:11:35,469 --> 01:11:37,562
Lungi, arrange it a
little higher. A little below.

988
01:11:37,638 --> 01:11:39,071
Above?
- Yes, it's done. It's done.

989
01:11:39,573 --> 01:11:40,699
It's done. It's done.
- Okay?

990
01:11:40,808 --> 01:11:43,276
It's done. It's done.

991
01:11:43,344 --> 01:11:45,312
Shankar, please wait.
- Yes.

992
01:11:47,448 --> 01:11:50,178
Hey, bhagwati.

993
01:11:52,153 --> 01:11:54,144
Give my fees. Give it quickly,
shankar. - Give him.

994
01:11:54,255 --> 01:11:55,688
You all are jumping in
such a way to grab it...

995
01:11:55,756 --> 01:11:57,451
...as if you have never
seen a coconut before.

996
01:11:57,558 --> 01:11:59,253
You all are hungry and unclad.
- Let them eat it.

997
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,520
Eat it. Eat it.

998
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:03,895
Atmaram. Abdul.
- Yes?

999
01:12:03,998 --> 01:12:05,397
Tell me one thing.
- Yes?

1000
01:12:05,466 --> 01:12:07,957
This shop is named as,
'shankar and sons'.

1001
01:12:08,436 --> 01:12:09,767
But shankar is still unmarried,
so where does he have sons?

1002
01:12:09,837 --> 01:12:10,929
That's right.

1003
01:12:11,005 --> 01:12:13,633
If he is unmarried, he will get
married soon. Take it. Eat it.

1004
01:12:13,741 --> 01:12:15,174
He has thought
carefully about his future.

1005
01:12:15,242 --> 01:12:16,470
Now have the sweetmeats.

1006
01:12:20,247 --> 01:12:22,272
Hail lord. Hail lord.

1007
01:12:25,953 --> 01:12:27,921
Hail bhagwati.

1008
01:12:28,622 --> 01:12:30,920
Congratulations.
- Shankar, come here for a minute.

1009
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,720
Here.

1010
01:12:41,202 --> 01:12:45,502
Take it. Keep it as a gift from me.

1011
01:12:50,244 --> 01:12:51,404
Enough.

1012
01:12:55,683 --> 01:12:57,116
Spend it carefully.

1013
01:12:58,252 --> 01:13:02,712
And spend it only where
it is required. - Okay.

1014
01:13:24,411 --> 01:13:29,041
"Welcome, lord krishna. Hail lord."

1015
01:13:29,116 --> 01:13:31,846
Today, i'll ruin the
dance class of this...

1016
01:13:31,919 --> 01:13:34,615
...wretched dancer with this smoke.

1017
01:13:35,022 --> 01:13:37,081
Wait and watch. Blow it upwards.
- Sure.

1018
01:13:37,758 --> 01:13:39,487
"Hail lord..."

1019
01:13:47,601 --> 01:13:50,399
don't stop now. See how that
dancer's dance will be ruined.

1020
01:13:50,471 --> 01:13:54,430
Wait and watch.
- "Let the heart burn..."

1021
01:13:54,508 --> 01:13:55,998
blow it upwards.

1022
01:13:57,011 --> 01:14:00,242
Hey? What childish
thing are you doing?

1023
01:14:00,514 --> 01:14:03,108
What you're doing
is completely wrong.

1024
01:14:03,651 --> 01:14:07,519
She is a poor girl. She
has a long life before her.

1025
01:14:07,588 --> 01:14:08,714
Why are you harassing her?

1026
01:14:08,789 --> 01:14:12,953
Headman, i don't have any hand
in this, i'm just supporting him.

1027
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:15,688
"Come on, smoke. Come on, smoke."

1028
01:14:15,763 --> 01:14:19,164
If this trick works today
and if this dancer runs away...

1029
01:14:19,567 --> 01:14:22,365
...by god, i'm telling you,
i'll go to the temple...

1030
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:24,663
...and offer the
offering to goddess. - Yes.

1031
01:14:24,772 --> 01:14:27,866
Oh, god! I won't get
involved in this mischief.

1032
01:14:27,975 --> 01:14:29,408
Where are you going, headman?

1033
01:14:29,476 --> 01:14:30,602
Where are you going? - Whatever
you are doing is wrong. It is...

1034
01:14:30,678 --> 01:14:32,270
it is too much. Not fair.

1035
01:14:33,847 --> 01:14:36,748
Wow.

1036
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:41,446
I'm the only gentleman who
favors the dancer in the village...

1037
01:14:41,522 --> 01:14:43,285
...and you threw water on me?

1038
01:14:43,357 --> 01:14:45,188
Wow.
- There we go.

1039
01:14:46,126 --> 01:14:49,118
Headman, i am sorry.

1040
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:55,900
Never mind. I liked it.
Do you have more?

1041
01:14:59,073 --> 01:15:02,941
I've mother, father and two
little brothers who go to school.

1042
01:15:04,478 --> 01:15:06,002
The truth is that...

1043
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,877
...i have to handle all the
responsibilities of my family.

1044
01:15:08,215 --> 01:15:11,776
I've begun this dance class
with great difficulty. - I see.

1045
01:15:12,653 --> 01:15:18,319
It's better if you repair
that building. That abdul...

1046
01:15:18,525 --> 01:15:21,358
i know that abdul
is very mischievous.

1047
01:15:22,596 --> 01:15:28,626
He and atmaram are always
up to some mischief. - Yes.

1048
01:15:29,536 --> 01:15:31,561
If you say, i'll kick him out.

1049
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:33,834
No, no. Let him be there.

1050
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:36,509
The poor fellow will be
deprived of his means of earning.

1051
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:42,814
It is too much.

1052
01:15:43,017 --> 01:15:44,416
On one hand you are
complaining about him...

1053
01:15:44,485 --> 01:15:45,884
...and saving him on the other.

1054
01:15:51,425 --> 01:15:55,794
Because of your honesty, i
gave you my place on low rent...

1055
01:15:55,896 --> 01:15:57,124
...and suffered a loss.

1056
01:15:58,232 --> 01:16:00,860
Yes. Yes, yes.

1057
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:05,969
This is my wife's
calling bell to call me inside.

1058
01:16:07,074 --> 01:16:09,099
Calling bell?
- Yes, the calling bell.

1059
01:16:10,144 --> 01:16:11,406
She feels very shy.

1060
01:16:11,645 --> 01:16:14,637
That's why she doesn't come
out of the house to meet someone.

1061
01:16:15,015 --> 01:16:16,915
Yes. Yes.

1062
01:16:19,486 --> 01:16:21,317
Yes?
- Who is this teacher?

1063
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:25,584
She is not a bad girl
as you are thinking.

1064
01:16:25,793 --> 01:16:27,920
She belongs to a very
decent and respectable family.

1065
01:16:27,995 --> 01:16:31,328
Look, i don't have anyone
in this world except you.

1066
01:16:31,598 --> 01:16:35,398
I can't even bear that
someone else sees you except me.

1067
01:16:35,803 --> 01:16:38,135
If you go near
someone just as a joke...

1068
01:16:38,205 --> 01:16:40,196
...your wife will jump in the sea.

1069
01:16:40,274 --> 01:16:43,766
Oh, allah (islamic deity), please
don't take any wrong step, honey.

1070
01:16:57,324 --> 01:17:00,919
"Don't burn your heart.
Don't burn your heart, beloved."

1071
01:17:01,428 --> 01:17:04,625
"Don't burn your heart."

1072
01:17:05,632 --> 01:17:09,227
"Don't burn your heart.
Don't burn your heart, beloved."

1073
01:17:09,803 --> 01:17:13,102
"Don't burn your heart."

1074
01:17:13,974 --> 01:17:20,812
"Don't burn your heart,
life resides in the heart."

1075
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:29,050
"Don't burn your heart,
life resides in the heart."

1076
01:17:29,123 --> 01:17:35,119
"When the smoke arises,
these eyes burn."

1077
01:17:35,329 --> 01:17:42,963
"When it wells up,
these eyes burn."

1078
01:17:43,237 --> 01:17:49,870
"Oh, sweetheart, oh,
beloved, don't feel miserable."

1079
01:17:49,977 --> 01:17:55,938
"When the smoke arises,
these eyes burn."

1080
01:17:56,250 --> 01:18:03,622
"When it wells up,
these eyes burn."

1081
01:18:27,014 --> 01:18:34,420
"I kept the letters on the wings
of your thoughts and flew them."

1082
01:18:35,389 --> 01:18:42,989
"I wrote blank letters and
put the stamp of my lips."

1083
01:18:43,797 --> 01:18:51,533
"I sat alone from the
evenings to the nights."

1084
01:18:51,839 --> 01:18:56,173
"Oh, sweetheart, oh, beloved."

1085
01:18:56,243 --> 01:19:01,704
"Oh, beloved."

1086
01:19:03,517 --> 01:19:09,114
"Oh, beloved."

1087
01:19:10,891 --> 01:19:15,555
"My eyes have become misty."

1088
01:19:15,629 --> 01:19:22,899
"Oh, sweetheart, oh, beloved."

1089
01:19:23,437 --> 01:19:28,204
"My eyes have become misty."

1090
01:19:37,751 --> 01:19:41,881
"The kohl spreads
when the tears flow."

1091
01:19:41,955 --> 01:19:45,721
"The salty tears well up in eyes."

1092
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:50,195
"The moments pass in a wink."

1093
01:19:50,397 --> 01:19:54,390
"The time passes
away beneath your feet."

1094
01:19:54,568 --> 01:19:58,732
"Let the smoke of the
body be confined to it."

1095
01:19:58,839 --> 01:20:05,642
"It shouldn't enter the heart,
the life resides in heart."

1096
01:20:07,281 --> 01:20:13,948
"Don't burn your heart,
life resides in the heart."

1097
01:20:14,121 --> 01:20:20,151
"When the smoke arises,
these eyes burn."

1098
01:20:20,227 --> 01:20:27,065
"When it wells up, these eyes burn."

1099
01:20:28,168 --> 01:20:34,835
"Oh, sweetheart, oh,
beloved, don't feel miserable."

1100
01:20:34,908 --> 01:20:40,904
"When the smoke arises,
these eyes burn."

1101
01:20:41,114 --> 01:20:48,520
"When it wells up,
these eyes burn."

1102
01:22:44,271 --> 01:22:45,465
Ravi? Hey?

1103
01:22:46,873 --> 01:22:49,205
Dear suvarna! Laxmi!
Look who has come.

1104
01:22:49,276 --> 01:22:51,301
Suvarna, come soon.
Come out quickly.

1105
01:22:51,545 --> 01:22:52,637
Ravi has come.
- Oh, ravi, you?

1106
01:22:52,712 --> 01:22:54,805
Ravi? - You didn't even
inform about your arrival.

1107
01:22:54,881 --> 01:22:56,280
We would have come to the airport.

1108
01:22:56,349 --> 01:22:57,839
Come in. Come in. Come.

1109
01:22:57,918 --> 01:22:59,385
So many days have passed.

1110
01:22:59,486 --> 01:23:00,885
You could have at
least made a call.

1111
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:03,445
Where were you for so many days?
Is everything fine?

1112
01:23:03,657 --> 01:23:05,147
Hey? You are looking so weak.

1113
01:23:05,325 --> 01:23:09,159
Whatever it is. We are satisfied
that you have come. - Yes.

1114
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,788
You are satisfied, right?
- Yes.

1115
01:23:10,897 --> 01:23:12,091
So let me tell you one more thing.

1116
01:23:12,165 --> 01:23:13,632
You will be more
satisfied when you hear it.

1117
01:23:14,034 --> 01:23:15,228
I am not going to return again.

1118
01:23:15,569 --> 01:23:18,265
Very good.
- I am not joking.

1119
01:23:19,239 --> 01:23:22,902
I had some problems there. My
visa is cancelled, too. - What?

1120
01:23:23,009 --> 01:23:25,170
I was also in prison for
two months. - What? Prison?

1121
01:23:25,512 --> 01:23:27,036
Shall i take your bag inside?

1122
01:23:27,114 --> 01:23:29,548
The neighbors will
start asking questions.

1123
01:23:29,649 --> 01:23:31,742
I don't have anything to give.
Just dirty clothes to wash.

1124
01:23:34,321 --> 01:23:35,652
Please listen to me.

1125
01:23:36,356 --> 01:23:40,417
But he had said that he
is going to dubai. - Yes.

1126
01:23:40,527 --> 01:23:41,926
Did he go directly to the prison?

1127
01:23:44,331 --> 01:23:49,860
Oh, it's the astrologer.
- Hey, mr. Shastri, hello.

1128
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:51,232
Don't look at him.
Don't look at him.

1129
01:23:51,304 --> 01:23:52,828
From where are you coming?

1130
01:23:52,906 --> 01:23:55,431
I have heard that ravi has
returned from dubai. - Yes.

1131
01:23:55,509 --> 01:23:57,033
He returned last night.
- Yes.

1132
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:59,044
We had gone to leave ravi and
suvarna to their house. - Yes.

1133
01:23:59,112 --> 01:24:03,446
I see. I see. We want a
feast on his return. - Yes.

1134
01:24:03,517 --> 01:24:06,645
Because he is the only foreign
returned son-in-law in our village.

1135
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,312
Definitely.
- Yes. Why not? Why not?

1136
01:24:08,989 --> 01:24:11,981
We'll definitely throw a party
as he is going to settle here now.

1137
01:24:12,092 --> 01:24:13,650
He'll stay here forever?
- Yes.

1138
01:24:13,727 --> 01:24:16,195
I mean suvarna has
stopped him from going abroad.

1139
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:18,561
He didn't refuse either.
- Yes.

1140
01:24:18,632 --> 01:24:20,759
Why should we interfere
between the husband and wife?

1141
01:24:20,834 --> 01:24:22,563
Yes, it's true.

1142
01:24:22,636 --> 01:24:24,763
He has a plan to begin
a transport business.

1143
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:28,437
He says he will buy 10-12 lorries.
- 10-12?

1144
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:30,271
I don't want to
interfere between them.

1145
01:24:30,477 --> 01:24:32,035
Let the children do
whatever they like.

1146
01:24:32,112 --> 01:24:33,670
We are getting late. We are going.

1147
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:37,546
Hey, listen. He is going to buy
10-12 lorries? - You mean trucks?

1148
01:24:37,651 --> 01:24:39,949
Yes. Oh, my lemon juice.

1149
01:24:40,053 --> 01:24:41,350
Will you drink it now?
- It's lying there.

1150
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:57,633
If your visa is cancelled once,
can't you make another?

1151
01:24:58,805 --> 01:25:00,500
Why? Do you want to go?

1152
01:25:01,174 --> 01:25:03,039
If i could get it,
would i have lived here?

1153
01:25:03,643 --> 01:25:05,736
I was put behind bars
inspite of being innocent.

1154
01:25:06,213 --> 01:25:07,339
I had already told you.

1155
01:25:07,447 --> 01:25:08,709
How many times will you
ask the same question?

1156
01:25:16,189 --> 01:25:17,588
When will we get our
daughter's ears pierced?

1157
01:25:17,691 --> 01:25:19,124
Has papa decided the date?

1158
01:25:19,559 --> 01:25:21,356
He will fix the date soon.

1159
01:25:21,795 --> 01:25:24,491
But papa was saying that
what if we carry out...

1160
01:25:24,564 --> 01:25:25,724
...this custom at his place?

1161
01:25:25,932 --> 01:25:29,095
No, no. The ritual of piercing her
ears will be done in this house.

1162
01:25:29,169 --> 01:25:30,261
We'll call him here.

1163
01:25:31,071 --> 01:25:32,561
I've already told the
goldsmith of this village.

1164
01:25:32,973 --> 01:25:34,372
He is old, but experienced.

1165
01:26:04,804 --> 01:26:07,773
I'll personally
invite mother and father...

1166
01:26:08,074 --> 01:26:09,803
...for our daughter's ear
piercing ceremony. Okay?

1167
01:26:20,387 --> 01:26:21,581
Well, i was thinking of getting...

1168
01:26:22,422 --> 01:26:27,086
...your ears pierced again
along with our daughter.

1169
01:26:28,762 --> 01:26:31,993
I talked about visa. That's
why you got angry with me, right?

1170
01:26:32,932 --> 01:26:35,093
Visa, foreign trip. Forget it.

1171
01:26:36,236 --> 01:26:38,363
Now stay right here with me.

1172
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,537
You want to buy a truck, don't you?

1173
01:26:42,142 --> 01:26:43,234
Buy it.

1174
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:46,508
I'll have to buy it. How
else can we run the house?

1175
01:26:48,381 --> 01:26:51,282
Besides, i was bored of
driving someone else's truck.

1176
01:26:51,351 --> 01:26:55,014
What? You worked as a driver there?

1177
01:26:55,455 --> 01:26:57,082
Forget it. Let's go to sleep.

1178
01:27:07,233 --> 01:27:09,599
Yes, that's it. Stop it here.
Enough. This is it.

1179
01:27:11,571 --> 01:27:12,765
The whole village came.

1180
01:27:13,807 --> 01:27:15,968
Gradually, the
villagers were going home.

1181
01:27:16,042 --> 01:27:19,068
I told the villagers that you
have to listen to my sermons.

1182
01:27:19,179 --> 01:27:21,340
You bet.
- Hail goddess bhagwati.

1183
01:27:22,482 --> 01:27:25,110
That's great.
- That's our ravi.

1184
01:27:25,819 --> 01:27:27,980
Yes, that's ravi.

1185
01:27:29,856 --> 01:27:32,120
What is he doing in front
of shankar's shop? - Yes.

1186
01:27:32,192 --> 01:27:33,318
Brother!

1187
01:27:34,561 --> 01:27:35,687
What is it? What do you want?

1188
01:27:36,363 --> 01:27:37,421
Come here.

1189
01:27:39,966 --> 01:27:42,366
What is it?
- Where's the goldsmith?

1190
01:27:42,435 --> 01:27:43,561
Isn't that his shop?

1191
01:27:43,636 --> 01:27:44,933
Shankar?
- Yes, shankar.

1192
01:27:45,605 --> 01:27:47,038
Don't know. He must
have gone out somewhere.

1193
01:27:47,874 --> 01:27:49,000
He might have gone to the city.

1194
01:27:55,715 --> 01:27:56,841
Look. He's coming on a cycle.

1195
01:27:57,283 --> 01:27:58,648
There. On a cycle.

1196
01:27:58,952 --> 01:28:00,078
That's shankar.

1197
01:28:08,194 --> 01:28:12,130
I think he found out about shankar
and suvarna's affair. - You bet.

1198
01:28:12,465 --> 01:28:14,160
Knives and swords will
be out today, i tell you.

1199
01:28:14,267 --> 01:28:17,236
It's a battle for love.
There's bound to be bloodshed.

1200
01:28:19,305 --> 01:28:20,704
Look. Look.

1201
01:28:23,343 --> 01:28:25,402
Things have worsened.
- Yes.

1202
01:28:26,413 --> 01:28:27,471
Oh, god!

1203
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:30,372
He's taking him away.

1204
01:28:31,418 --> 01:28:35,115
Shall we go? - Oh, no. Let's wait.
Let them create a scene.

1205
01:28:35,221 --> 01:28:38,122
It will be fun.
- Goddess bhagwati, protect shankar.

1206
01:28:38,191 --> 01:28:39,385
Hail goddess bhagwati.

1207
01:28:41,895 --> 01:28:43,021
Hello.
- Hello.

1208
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,226
Please come.

1209
01:28:49,335 --> 01:28:50,427
This is my father-in-law.

1210
01:28:55,275 --> 01:28:56,970
Who doesn't know him?

1211
01:28:57,043 --> 01:28:59,409
He's a great
astrologer of our village.

1212
01:29:00,046 --> 01:29:01,673
And my neighbor as well.

1213
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:07,119
Let's wrap up the rituals quickly.
I have to go back to the village.

1214
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:09,518
Yes, sure. Have a seat.
I'll be right back. - Okay.

1215
01:29:14,394 --> 01:29:16,919
I hope the wire isn't rusted.

1216
01:29:17,464 --> 01:29:20,228
You advice people about
wearing precious stones.

1217
01:29:20,867 --> 01:29:25,998
Yet, you don't know that a
goldsmith or gold doesn't rust.

1218
01:29:30,276 --> 01:29:31,800
Please come in.
- Yes.

1219
01:29:33,713 --> 01:29:35,340
Good day.

1220
01:29:36,483 --> 01:29:37,575
Have a seat.

1221
01:29:42,055 --> 01:29:43,181
Suvarna!

1222
01:30:03,576 --> 01:30:05,043
What are you doing?

1223
01:30:07,247 --> 01:30:08,305
What happened?
- I don't want to get...

1224
01:30:08,381 --> 01:30:09,405
...her ears pierced
by this goldsmith.

1225
01:30:12,752 --> 01:30:14,276
Why? Now what happened to you?

1226
01:30:15,555 --> 01:30:18,422
The old goldsmith got sick.
What could i do?

1227
01:30:18,625 --> 01:30:20,718
And shankar just looks young.
But he's an experienced goldsmith.

1228
01:30:20,793 --> 01:30:22,488
It was tough to
convince him anyway. - What?

1229
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:24,426
He wasn't willing to come.
I dragged him here.

1230
01:30:24,931 --> 01:30:26,228
Come on, hurry up. The
auspicious time is passing by.

1231
01:30:26,332 --> 01:30:29,358
No. No. We'll look for
some other auspicious date.

1232
01:30:29,435 --> 01:30:30,629
Laxmi is right.

1233
01:30:30,703 --> 01:30:32,898
I'll find some other
auspicious date. - No need.

1234
01:30:33,006 --> 01:30:34,064
Her ears will be pierced.
Right now.

1235
01:30:34,173 --> 01:30:36,198
But this goldsmith will not
pierce my daughter's ears.

1236
01:30:38,745 --> 01:30:39,905
You don't know this.

1237
01:30:40,013 --> 01:30:41,640
He had pierced the
ears of many infants.

1238
01:30:41,714 --> 01:30:43,113
The ears of all those
infants got infected.

1239
01:30:43,349 --> 01:30:46,341
Yes, ravi. His father
had pierced suvarna's ears.

1240
01:30:46,452 --> 01:30:47,578
Her ears also got infected.

1241
01:30:50,456 --> 01:30:51,821
Now forget all that.

1242
01:30:51,925 --> 01:30:53,119
Ravi, do one thing.

1243
01:30:53,192 --> 01:30:54,750
Since you've called him here,
pay him rs. 10 or rs. 20...

1244
01:30:54,827 --> 01:30:56,692
...and ask him to leave.
- Yes.

1245
01:30:56,796 --> 01:30:58,354
We'll hold this ritual
some other time. - Yes.

1246
01:30:58,431 --> 01:30:59,591
Right?
- Yes.

1247
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:00,792
Okay.

1248
01:31:02,368 --> 01:31:03,460
Give her to me.
- Hey...

1249
01:31:06,406 --> 01:31:07,634
hey.
- What...

1250
01:31:15,181 --> 01:31:16,409
shankar! Shankar!

1251
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:20,879
Shankar, don't feel
bad about what they say.

1252
01:31:21,354 --> 01:31:22,446
They are orthodox people.

1253
01:31:22,522 --> 01:31:24,319
Come back with me.

1254
01:31:26,225 --> 01:31:28,489
I'll take your leave.
- Shankar.

1255
01:31:29,862 --> 01:31:31,591
I'm calling you back.

1256
01:31:32,131 --> 01:31:34,429
I apologize to you on
their behalf. Please.

1257
01:31:37,203 --> 01:31:39,103
I have no complaints
against you, ravi.

1258
01:31:40,873 --> 01:31:42,807
If they had any reservations
about my piercing the ears...

1259
01:31:42,875 --> 01:31:44,001
...then they should have told me.

1260
01:31:45,645 --> 01:31:47,408
Why did they have to lie?

1261
01:31:49,282 --> 01:31:53,582
Not a single infant's ears,
which i pierced, have got infected.

1262
01:31:54,687 --> 01:31:57,656
The goldsmith feels the
greatest while piercing the ears.

1263
01:31:57,757 --> 01:31:59,384
His heart is hurt.

1264
01:32:01,527 --> 01:32:03,051
You people won't understand this.

1265
01:32:16,476 --> 01:32:19,377
What are you melting down?
- My heart.

1266
01:32:21,581 --> 01:32:24,516
Oh, how can i serve you?

1267
01:32:24,751 --> 01:32:27,015
My right ear is paining.

1268
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:29,748
I guess it's swollen.

1269
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:34,117
I have to get rid of it,
but i can't due to the pain.

1270
01:32:34,994 --> 01:32:36,120
Have a seat.

1271
01:32:42,669 --> 01:32:43,795
Show me.

1272
01:32:44,637 --> 01:32:46,662
Can't see any swelling.

1273
01:32:47,907 --> 01:32:50,068
I guess you must have
pressed it too hard.

1274
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:54,337
Hold this.

1275
01:32:55,448 --> 01:32:56,540
Okay?

1276
01:33:00,853 --> 01:33:03,617
Tell me. What else can
i do for you?

1277
01:33:04,524 --> 01:33:06,185
I can't wear these now.

1278
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:08,821
Sell them if you can.

1279
01:33:09,128 --> 01:33:11,187
That would be better.

1280
01:33:12,999 --> 01:33:16,059
Looks like more than the earring,
you need money.

1281
01:33:21,207 --> 01:33:22,333
How much money do you need?

1282
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:25,471
Whatever you can get from these?

1283
01:33:27,246 --> 01:33:28,907
You're finding it
difficult to send money back home?

1284
01:33:31,617 --> 01:33:32,709
Yes.

1285
01:33:34,454 --> 01:33:37,355
How do you manage to live?

1286
01:33:40,193 --> 01:33:43,424
I haven't started living yet.

1287
01:33:46,432 --> 01:33:47,558
Wait here.

1288
01:33:58,678 --> 01:33:59,940
'Spend it wisely.'

1289
01:34:00,513 --> 01:34:03,539
'Spend it where it's badly needed.'

1290
01:34:08,387 --> 01:34:09,513
Keep this.

1291
01:34:12,358 --> 01:34:13,848
And wear these, too.

1292
01:34:14,694 --> 01:34:16,889
Your ears aren't infected.

1293
01:34:19,132 --> 01:34:22,568
And don't worry
about returning it. Okay?

1294
01:34:43,289 --> 01:34:46,486
Yes, i'm here. I haven't studied.
What do i do?

1295
01:35:08,281 --> 01:35:10,681
It's in a good condition.
But it's too costly.

1296
01:35:10,783 --> 01:35:12,375
What are you saying, sir?

1297
01:35:12,518 --> 01:35:14,713
You're the fourth
buyer of this mini-truck.

1298
01:35:14,821 --> 01:35:16,721
But it still runs
like a brand new one.

1299
01:35:17,089 --> 01:35:19,148
The previous owner
profited it a lot.

1300
01:35:19,258 --> 01:35:21,317
You'll see. You'll
also make lots of profit.

1301
01:35:35,074 --> 01:35:36,769
Are you sleeping
with your eyes open?

1302
01:35:36,976 --> 01:35:38,375
I've been calling you.

1303
01:35:38,644 --> 01:35:39,872
Aren't you going to
take a shower today?

1304
01:35:40,413 --> 01:35:42,040
I will go. Take it easy.

1305
01:35:43,349 --> 01:35:44,816
I'm in a different mood today.

1306
01:35:45,151 --> 01:35:46,618
Really?
- What is it?

1307
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:49,553
Were you thinking
about something good?

1308
01:35:56,529 --> 01:35:58,793
What's the weight of this necklace?

1309
01:35:59,532 --> 01:36:00,863
Ten 'tolas'. Why?

1310
01:36:01,367 --> 01:36:02,527
Show it to me, please.

1311
01:36:08,441 --> 01:36:09,465
Careful.

1312
01:36:12,245 --> 01:36:15,408
I was thinking of buying you
another necklace just like this.

1313
01:36:15,481 --> 01:36:17,210
A necklace of ten 'tolas'.
- Really?

1314
01:36:18,184 --> 01:36:19,879
But not like this one.
Some other design.

1315
01:36:20,119 --> 01:36:21,313
Studded with pearls.

1316
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,081
I love studded necklaces.

1317
01:36:23,189 --> 01:36:24,850
Yes, i'll buy you
a studded necklace.

1318
01:36:24,924 --> 01:36:26,721
Promise?
- Promise.

1319
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,994
But first, i have to sell it...

1320
01:36:30,396 --> 01:36:32,125
...and pay up the last
installment of the truck.

1321
01:36:32,198 --> 01:36:33,358
What?

1322
01:36:33,432 --> 01:36:36,333
When the truck runs on the
sonapur-mumbai highway...

1323
01:36:36,769 --> 01:36:38,430
...i'll buy you this necklace...

1324
01:36:38,537 --> 01:36:41,131
...and the studded
necklace with its income. - No.

1325
01:36:41,207 --> 01:36:42,333
No. No.

1326
01:36:42,408 --> 01:36:43,500
I won't let you sell it.

1327
01:36:43,609 --> 01:36:44,701
Papa gifted it to me.

1328
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:46,471
You and your papa.

1329
01:36:47,647 --> 01:36:49,046
You got married to a
dubai returned guy.

1330
01:36:49,115 --> 01:36:51,675
That's why your papa gave
you this necklace in dowry.

1331
01:36:52,418 --> 01:36:55,512
You're wearing it all the time.
It should be of some use to us.

1332
01:36:55,621 --> 01:36:58,488
And didn't i tell you
i'll get you a new one?

1333
01:36:58,557 --> 01:37:00,491
But is it necessary
to sell this necklace?

1334
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,151
It is necessary.
- No.

1335
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:21,078
Ravi, it's you?

1336
01:37:21,347 --> 01:37:25,306
Come. Take a seat. Sit. Sit.

1337
01:37:27,286 --> 01:37:29,311
Hey, look over there.

1338
01:37:30,389 --> 01:37:33,654
I know you got humiliated
the other day because of me.

1339
01:37:33,993 --> 01:37:37,087
I apologize to you once
again on their behalf.

1340
01:37:37,163 --> 01:37:39,188
Why are you apologizing?

1341
01:37:39,298 --> 01:37:43,200
If your family doesn't mind it,
i'm willing to come today.

1342
01:37:43,836 --> 01:37:44,996
So what can i do for you?

1343
01:37:47,573 --> 01:37:50,474
I'm thinking of buying a truck.

1344
01:37:51,811 --> 01:37:53,403
I've checked out a couple.

1345
01:37:54,213 --> 01:37:56,306
But i'm falling short of money.

1346
01:37:58,517 --> 01:38:00,417
What's the rate of gold these days?

1347
01:38:01,887 --> 01:38:03,081
The market is good.

1348
01:38:04,190 --> 01:38:05,885
It went up by rs. 500 today.

1349
01:38:05,958 --> 01:38:07,949
What do you want to sell?

1350
01:38:09,195 --> 01:38:12,130
I think there's some problem.
- What's going on there?

1351
01:38:12,198 --> 01:38:14,359
My wife has a lot of jewelery.

1352
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,963
But if i sell this
necklace weighing ten 'tolas'...

1353
01:38:18,037 --> 01:38:19,402
...then how much will i get?

1354
01:38:23,642 --> 01:38:24,973
Gold necklace?

1355
01:38:25,211 --> 01:38:27,475
Oh, goddess bhagwati.
- Oh, allah.

1356
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:28,808
I didn't get it made for her.

1357
01:38:28,881 --> 01:38:31,315
My father-in-law gifted it
to my wife during the wedding.

1358
01:38:31,851 --> 01:38:34,581
By the way, i'm
not too fond of gold.

1359
01:38:34,854 --> 01:38:39,154
"What do i have to say to you?"

1360
01:38:39,692 --> 01:38:45,722
"What do i have to hear from you?"

1361
01:38:46,766 --> 01:38:56,107
"Why make a garland of
flowers thrown by the branches?"

1362
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:58,301
'Nobody gave me a nuptial necklace.'

1363
01:38:58,444 --> 01:38:59,775
'Nor did i love anyone.'

1364
01:38:59,845 --> 01:39:04,873
"The silence of the
flowers says everything."

1365
01:39:08,287 --> 01:39:11,779
"You may or may not speak."

1366
01:39:16,595 --> 01:39:18,426
This gold has come in handy for you.

1367
01:39:20,166 --> 01:39:22,361
That's the importance of gold.

1368
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:27,401
It comes in handy
during trying times.

1369
01:39:29,108 --> 01:39:30,700
But there's a problem.

1370
01:39:32,645 --> 01:39:35,113
I won't be able to buy
such an expensive necklace.

1371
01:39:35,214 --> 01:39:38,650
I'll have to visit a
jeweler in the city. - Okay.

1372
01:39:39,518 --> 01:39:41,713
But i shouldn't be accused of theft.

1373
01:39:42,388 --> 01:39:45,016
How can anyone accuse you?

1374
01:39:46,826 --> 01:39:48,919
That's because it's
a matter of dowry.

1375
01:39:49,562 --> 01:39:51,553
Don't worry about that. I'm here.

1376
01:39:53,232 --> 01:39:54,392
Okay.

1377
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:55,658
Chief.
- Yes?

1378
01:39:55,768 --> 01:39:58,259
I say let's go there on
the pretext of donation.

1379
01:39:58,504 --> 01:39:59,732
Good idea.

1380
01:39:59,839 --> 01:40:01,466
Come on. Let's go.
- Go find out. Find out.

1381
01:40:01,941 --> 01:40:03,169
Go on. Go on.

1382
01:40:04,443 --> 01:40:05,842
Why did they go to ask donation?

1383
01:40:05,911 --> 01:40:07,105
They won't ask for donation.

1384
01:40:07,379 --> 01:40:09,279
They've gone to find out
what's happening there.

1385
01:40:10,116 --> 01:40:11,481
How are you, shankar?

1386
01:40:11,817 --> 01:40:13,682
Hello.
- Be happy, sir.

1387
01:40:13,919 --> 01:40:15,284
Hello.
- Hello.

1388
01:40:16,755 --> 01:40:19,315
Shankar, we were out
to collect donations...

1389
01:40:19,391 --> 01:40:22,758
since when have you been into
collecting donations, bholenath?

1390
01:40:22,928 --> 01:40:24,361
Oh, goddess bhagwati.

1391
01:40:24,463 --> 01:40:26,226
If i collect donations now...

1392
01:40:26,332 --> 01:40:27,959
...only then will i be
able to dance at the fair.

1393
01:40:28,033 --> 01:40:29,227
Right, sir?

1394
01:40:29,468 --> 01:40:31,800
Sir, i found out about your work.

1395
01:40:31,971 --> 01:40:34,166
But it was good. Thank
god you had to leave dubai.

1396
01:40:34,473 --> 01:40:36,805
If you stay here with
your wife and kids...

1397
01:40:36,876 --> 01:40:39,003
...then goddess bhagwati
will be kind to you. - Yes.

1398
01:40:39,311 --> 01:40:41,279
Well, we're committee members.

1399
01:40:41,614 --> 01:40:43,946
We're collecting
donations for the fair.

1400
01:40:44,049 --> 01:40:45,744
You can also donate if you want.

1401
01:40:45,951 --> 01:40:47,248
Rs. 1000 or rs. 5000.

1402
01:40:47,319 --> 01:40:49,048
Whatever...
- chief! Chief! - whatever you like.

1403
01:40:49,121 --> 01:40:50,315
There's a time for everything.

1404
01:40:50,389 --> 01:40:51,549
Please wait.

1405
01:40:51,991 --> 01:40:55,017
Let us complete the deal between us.

1406
01:40:55,127 --> 01:40:56,389
Yes.
- Yes.

1407
01:40:56,462 --> 01:40:59,693
No. Doesn't matter. I'm not in
a hurry. I'll come later on.

1408
01:40:59,798 --> 01:41:01,425
Sit down. Sit down.

1409
01:41:02,701 --> 01:41:06,330
It is said there's
truth hidden in gold.

1410
01:41:07,039 --> 01:41:10,065
You shouldn't buy or
sell it in a hurry.

1411
01:41:12,211 --> 01:41:15,180
Do you want money
today or tomorrow will do?

1412
01:41:15,614 --> 01:41:17,411
As soon as possible.

1413
01:41:17,483 --> 01:41:20,247
No. It's up to you. I just have to
go to the city and get the money.

1414
01:41:21,353 --> 01:41:23,548
It's been ages since i
saw such a big necklace.

1415
01:41:25,891 --> 01:41:27,324
Let me check it first.

1416
01:42:01,460 --> 01:42:03,394
How much did you say it weighs?

1417
01:42:04,463 --> 01:42:05,623
Ten 'tolas'.

1418
01:42:06,365 --> 01:42:07,957
Father-in-law gave
it as dowry, right?

1419
01:42:09,468 --> 01:42:11,060
What else can he give?

1420
01:42:12,538 --> 01:42:14,472
Why? Is there a problem?

1421
01:42:15,874 --> 01:42:17,967
It's made completely of copper.

1422
01:42:22,514 --> 01:42:24,744
All that glitters is not gold.

1423
01:42:26,852 --> 01:42:28,615
A guy from dubai
comes to me with gold.

1424
01:42:28,854 --> 01:42:31,322
Forget ten 'tolas'. This doesn't
even contain 1.25 gm of gold.

1425
01:42:31,724 --> 01:42:33,316
Do you think i'm a fool?

1426
01:42:35,227 --> 01:42:37,058
He was trying to
sell me fake jewelery.

1427
01:42:37,997 --> 01:42:39,328
Thank god i checked it.

1428
01:42:39,398 --> 01:42:40,626
All of you are witness.

1429
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,800
Had i gone to the city, i
could have got arrested for fraud.

1430
01:42:47,106 --> 01:42:48,664
We can confirm it quite easily.

1431
01:42:49,475 --> 01:42:52,342
Take it and get it
checked from any jeweler.

1432
01:42:53,345 --> 01:42:54,505
Take it.

1433
01:43:06,191 --> 01:43:09,058
How did the hammer strike,
bholenath?

1434
01:43:10,696 --> 01:43:13,790
Finally, the time
has heated the iron.

1435
01:43:15,501 --> 01:43:19,801
What i had given was
made of pure copper.

1436
01:43:21,140 --> 01:43:23,074
Real copper.

1437
01:43:25,077 --> 01:43:27,705
I'm the son of bhaskar,
the goldsmith.

1438
01:43:28,414 --> 01:43:30,507
Bhaskar, the goldsmith.

1439
01:43:31,884 --> 01:43:34,148
You've won, shankar.

1440
01:43:34,687 --> 01:43:37,485
Hail goddess bhagwati.

1441
01:43:42,528 --> 01:43:44,587
Shankar has won.
- What?

1442
01:43:44,663 --> 01:43:47,928
The necklace he gave to
swarnalata was made of copper.

1443
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,959
Gold plated copper. That's
fantastic. - What's he saying?

1444
01:43:52,037 --> 01:43:53,834
Villagers, listen. - It means
the tables have been turned.

1445
01:43:54,073 --> 01:43:56,303
Another scene for sure.

1446
01:44:16,595 --> 01:44:17,721
Suvarna!

1447
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,761
Do you think i'm a fool?

1448
01:44:25,571 --> 01:44:27,766
Your father gave this
necklace to you, didn't he?

1449
01:44:28,874 --> 01:44:30,273
If he didn't have money,
he should have said so.

1450
01:44:30,376 --> 01:44:32,207
Why did he do such a cheap thing?

1451
01:44:32,277 --> 01:44:33,767
What happened?

1452
01:44:34,513 --> 01:44:37,073
Didn't you know that this
necklace is made of copper?

1453
01:44:39,351 --> 01:44:42,650
You plated copper
with gold and fooled me.

1454
01:44:43,122 --> 01:44:45,955
Now i understood why you
wouldn't remove this necklace.

1455
01:44:46,492 --> 01:44:49,222
"I won't remove this necklace.
Papa gave it to me".

1456
01:44:49,528 --> 01:44:53,624
Thank shankar, the goldsmith,
whom you insulted in this house.

1457
01:44:54,066 --> 01:44:55,192
He saved me.

1458
01:44:55,267 --> 01:44:57,064
Otherwise, i would have
been behind bars for fraud.

1459
01:44:57,169 --> 01:44:58,363
But...
- quiet!

1460
01:44:59,371 --> 01:45:01,601
Don't pretend to be shocked. Okay?

1461
01:45:02,007 --> 01:45:04,032
Go bring the kid and come with me.

1462
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:09,243
I'll take your father to task
right in front of the whole village.

1463
01:45:09,581 --> 01:45:11,845
But shankar is no saint.

1464
01:45:11,917 --> 01:45:14,408
He cheated them first by
giving them fake jewelery.

1465
01:45:14,486 --> 01:45:16,579
What are you saying?
Swarnalata betrayed him as well.

1466
01:45:16,688 --> 01:45:17,985
There. Mr. Haji is here.

1467
01:45:23,695 --> 01:45:25,686
Hello.
- Hello. - hello. - hello.

1468
01:45:26,832 --> 01:45:30,268
Shankar, what have you done?

1469
01:45:30,736 --> 01:45:31,862
What happened?

1470
01:45:32,037 --> 01:45:33,334
I have not done anything.

1471
01:45:34,406 --> 01:45:37,375
They stole my necklace in
public and i removed the plating.

1472
01:45:37,443 --> 01:45:38,501
That's all i've done.

1473
01:45:38,610 --> 01:45:40,168
Shankar, no matter what happens.
Don't give in.

1474
01:45:40,245 --> 01:45:41,712
This shouldn't happen
in this village again.

1475
01:45:41,814 --> 01:45:43,611
Don't worry. We're with you.

1476
01:45:43,882 --> 01:45:45,816
I say it's not a good thing.

1477
01:45:45,884 --> 01:45:47,749
Listen. Do one thing. Come here.

1478
01:45:48,454 --> 01:45:49,785
Yes.

1479
01:45:50,122 --> 01:45:53,888
No matter what you say,
shankar made the first mistake.

1480
01:45:54,126 --> 01:45:57,152
Suvarna is married. She has a kid.

1481
01:45:57,329 --> 01:45:59,422
In that case, he shouldn't
have told her the truth.

1482
01:46:00,165 --> 01:46:03,066
If the gold is not pure, how
can a goldsmith say it's pure?

1483
01:46:03,268 --> 01:46:04,633
Had ravi not gone
to shankar to sell...

1484
01:46:04,703 --> 01:46:06,000
...the necklace
weighing ten 'tolas'...

1485
01:46:06,071 --> 01:46:07,834
...the truth would have
never been revealed.

1486
01:46:07,906 --> 01:46:09,168
How is shankar to be blamed?

1487
01:46:09,241 --> 01:46:10,435
But shankar gave it to her.

1488
01:46:10,542 --> 01:46:12,407
But shastri said the gold is his.

1489
01:46:12,478 --> 01:46:13,638
Come on.

1490
01:46:14,012 --> 01:46:15,479
Hail goddess bhagwati.

1491
01:46:15,981 --> 01:46:17,243
Let's see what happens.

1492
01:46:20,252 --> 01:46:21,412
Hail goddess bhagwati.

1493
01:46:21,487 --> 01:46:23,284
There's going to be a commotion.
- It will be fun.

1494
01:46:23,355 --> 01:46:25,050
Brother atmaram, what's going on?

1495
01:46:25,123 --> 01:46:27,353
Shankar won the game.
- What do you mean?

1496
01:46:27,459 --> 01:46:29,222
It means nothing.
Just watch the fun.

1497
01:46:31,563 --> 01:46:32,723
What happened?

1498
01:46:33,031 --> 01:46:34,498
Mother.
- What happened?

1499
01:46:36,802 --> 01:46:38,064
How much does this necklace weigh?

1500
01:46:39,538 --> 01:46:41,369
Ten 'tolas'.

1501
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,638
Right, laxmi?
- Yes, it weighs ten 'tolas'.

1502
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:46,643
Oh, really?

1503
01:46:46,979 --> 01:46:48,879
So the women were also involved?

1504
01:46:50,282 --> 01:46:51,909
Did you really think...

1505
01:46:52,284 --> 01:46:54,411
...that your daughter would go
around with a copper necklace...

1506
01:46:54,486 --> 01:46:56,750
...plated with gold and
i won't know about it?

1507
01:46:57,356 --> 01:46:59,119
Copper?
- Copper?

1508
01:46:59,191 --> 01:47:00,317
Yes, copper.

1509
01:47:00,392 --> 01:47:01,984
The necklace is a fake.

1510
01:47:03,262 --> 01:47:04,786
If the necklace is impure...

1511
01:47:04,863 --> 01:47:06,592
...then your daughter
must also be impure.

1512
01:47:07,599 --> 01:47:10,693
This marriage will continue
only when i get to know the truth.

1513
01:47:10,769 --> 01:47:12,532
How can it be made of copper?

1514
01:47:16,174 --> 01:47:17,266
Let's go inside.

1515
01:47:17,943 --> 01:47:20,741
Ravi, just listen to me.

1516
01:47:20,946 --> 01:47:23,312
What's left to hear, father-in-law?

1517
01:47:23,415 --> 01:47:25,849
Son, let's go inside and talk.
- Why?

1518
01:47:26,084 --> 01:47:27,210
Why inside?

1519
01:47:27,286 --> 01:47:29,447
Are you afraid of
losing your honor in public?

1520
01:47:29,755 --> 01:47:31,655
Let the villagers also know...

1521
01:47:31,957 --> 01:47:36,519
...the achievements of the
great astrologer daya shastri.

1522
01:47:36,929 --> 01:47:39,295
I made a mistake, son. Forgive me.

1523
01:47:39,565 --> 01:47:43,228
I beg of you.
- It's no use falling at my feet.

1524
01:47:43,602 --> 01:47:46,537
If you're so keen of doing that,
then go beg to shankar.

1525
01:47:46,605 --> 01:47:50,166
Shankar? - If it wasn't for him, i
would have been in prison today.

1526
01:47:51,043 --> 01:47:52,840
Necklace weighing ten 'tolas'.

1527
01:47:52,911 --> 01:47:54,503
Enough! That's too much.

1528
01:47:54,713 --> 01:47:57,807
There's no need to put
him on a higher pedestal.

1529
01:47:58,050 --> 01:48:01,486
The truth is that
shankar gave me this necklace.

1530
01:48:04,489 --> 01:48:05,717
Suvarna.

1531
01:48:06,224 --> 01:48:08,624
He told me it is made
of ten 'tolas' of gold.

1532
01:48:08,727 --> 01:48:11,059
If you don't believe me,
then go ask him.

1533
01:48:17,035 --> 01:48:19,367
Things are getting
too hot to handle.

1534
01:48:19,571 --> 01:48:21,596
I say this is the right
opportunity to give them a slip.

1535
01:48:21,773 --> 01:48:23,172
Quiet, you idiot.

1536
01:48:23,342 --> 01:48:25,003
Let me watch the complete show.

1537
01:48:30,582 --> 01:48:32,914
Ravi. I'll tell you the truth.

1538
01:48:33,685 --> 01:48:37,086
Shankar wanted to marry suvarna.

1539
01:48:37,155 --> 01:48:38,918
I was against their marriage.

1540
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:44,285
He gifted suvarna this necklace.

1541
01:48:45,731 --> 01:48:49,132
I got greedy on seeing this
necklace weighing ten 'tolas'.

1542
01:48:51,269 --> 01:48:53,760
I stole his necklace.

1543
01:48:54,139 --> 01:48:56,869
I never thought this necklace...

1544
01:48:58,377 --> 01:49:04,612
...would bring
trouble for my daughter.

1545
01:49:06,618 --> 01:49:09,280
The one who speaks the
truth is afraid of no one.

1546
01:49:09,721 --> 01:49:12,485
You're right.
- Ravi, don't lose courage.

1547
01:49:12,557 --> 01:49:14,548
Ravi, move forward. We are with you.

1548
01:49:16,528 --> 01:49:18,325
Yes.

1549
01:49:19,164 --> 01:49:20,529
Look. He's smoking here.

1550
01:49:20,599 --> 01:49:22,464
Shankar, there's a problem.

1551
01:49:22,701 --> 01:49:24,032
Ravi has lost his mind.

1552
01:49:24,102 --> 01:49:26,593
He has some people with him.
The village head as well. - Yes.

1553
01:49:26,672 --> 01:49:27,969
I knew he'd turn on you.

1554
01:49:28,473 --> 01:49:29,940
But don't be afraid. We're with you.

1555
01:49:30,042 --> 01:49:31,532
Abdul, why are you instigating him?
- No, i'm not.

1556
01:49:31,643 --> 01:49:33,508
Shankar, don't do
anything untoward in your rage.

1557
01:49:33,612 --> 01:49:34,840
What could happen?

1558
01:49:34,946 --> 01:49:37,039
Truth will prevail today.
- Absolutely.

1559
01:49:37,115 --> 01:49:41,176
Allah, you've punished
shastri for being so cunning.

1560
01:49:41,286 --> 01:49:42,446
You've done the right thing.
- Yes.

1561
01:49:42,521 --> 01:49:44,318
Why do you give allah
the credit for that?

1562
01:49:44,456 --> 01:49:47,391
That was shankar's wittiness.
Well done, young man.

1563
01:49:48,326 --> 01:49:49,623
The decision has to be made today.

1564
01:49:49,695 --> 01:49:51,356
I say don't lose courage.

1565
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:53,398
Come on. No matter
what happens. We'll see.

1566
01:49:56,001 --> 01:49:58,595
Let's get out of here.
- Bholenath.

1567
01:50:09,247 --> 01:50:10,407
Did you understand, shankar?

1568
01:50:25,997 --> 01:50:31,367
Scoundrel, your real
face has been exposed.

1569
01:50:37,042 --> 01:50:38,873
This is your fake jewelery.

1570
01:50:40,545 --> 01:50:43,742
You tried to lure suvarna with
this fake jewelery, didn't you?

1571
01:50:47,719 --> 01:50:50,620
Hey, let go off me.
Don't even try to touch me.

1572
01:50:58,196 --> 01:51:01,893
"Two bodies and two souls."

1573
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,937
"Were one some time ago."

1574
01:51:13,378 --> 01:51:16,939
"Two bodies and two souls."

1575
01:51:17,048 --> 01:51:20,677
"Were one some time ago."

1576
01:51:20,852 --> 01:51:24,310
"Their loyalty was questionable."

1577
01:51:24,422 --> 01:51:28,518
"Friends turned betrayers."

1578
01:51:31,596 --> 01:51:35,532
"If they don't see each other..."

1579
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:38,899
"...then it hurts."

1580
01:51:39,171 --> 01:51:43,005
"If they don't see each other..."

1581
01:51:43,108 --> 01:51:46,100
"...then it hurts."

1582
01:51:46,645 --> 01:51:53,380
"Same beginning. Same result."

1583
01:51:53,485 --> 01:51:56,977
"Who is at fault?"

1584
01:51:57,355 --> 01:51:59,050
"This is what happens."

1585
01:51:59,157 --> 01:52:00,920
"This is what happens."

1586
01:52:00,992 --> 01:52:04,359
"This is what happens."

1587
01:52:18,977 --> 01:52:21,878
Ma'am. Ma'am.
- Who is it?

1588
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:24,005
I'm atmaram, the one
who bought your cow.

1589
01:52:24,082 --> 01:52:27,449
Ravi found out about
shankar and swarnalata's affair.

1590
01:52:27,519 --> 01:52:28,713
He has gone crazy.

1591
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:30,344
There are riots in the village.

1592
01:52:30,422 --> 01:52:32,617
Everyone is beating
up haji. Come quickly.

1593
01:52:32,724 --> 01:52:33,782
Come quickly.

1594
01:52:33,892 --> 01:52:35,484
Ma'am, come quickly.

1595
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,118
Come quickly.

1596
01:52:40,031 --> 01:52:42,465
Where is he? Oh, god, where is he?

1597
01:52:42,634 --> 01:52:44,499
For god's sake, take
me there immediately.

1598
01:52:50,609 --> 01:52:54,238
"Neither me, nor my
heart had its way."

1599
01:52:54,512 --> 01:52:57,106
"Things just happen."

1600
01:52:58,283 --> 01:53:04,745
"Same beginning. Same result."

1601
01:53:04,823 --> 01:53:07,917
"Who is at fault?"

1602
01:53:08,193 --> 01:53:12,152
"This is what happens."

1603
01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:14,790
"This is what happens."

1604
01:53:21,473 --> 01:53:22,633
Stop!

1605
01:53:23,041 --> 01:53:24,474
Stop!

1606
01:53:27,512 --> 01:53:28,638
Haji's wife!

1607
01:53:30,515 --> 01:53:32,745
Haji's wife!
- Stop!

1608
01:53:34,486 --> 01:53:36,044
Haji's wife is here.

1609
01:53:36,354 --> 01:53:37,616
Stop.

1610
01:53:39,224 --> 01:53:40,623
Haji's wife.

1611
01:53:46,765 --> 01:53:48,164
My lady?

1612
01:53:51,469 --> 01:53:53,266
Why did you come here, my lady?

1613
01:53:53,405 --> 01:53:54,838
Had something happened to you...

1614
01:53:55,407 --> 01:53:57,034
...my life would
have been meaningless.

1615
01:53:57,275 --> 01:53:58,401
Let's get out of here. Come on.

1616
01:53:59,110 --> 01:54:00,338
Be quiet.

1617
01:54:00,912 --> 01:54:02,243
You've hid me enough.

1618
01:54:02,314 --> 01:54:03,440
Now let me talk.

1619
01:54:04,282 --> 01:54:06,750
And all of you? Why did you stop?

1620
01:54:06,885 --> 01:54:08,580
Beat up each other.

1621
01:54:09,387 --> 01:54:11,582
Kill each other for the
sake of a single girl.

1622
01:54:12,724 --> 01:54:15,784
Even god must be
ashamed of your behavior.

1623
01:54:16,761 --> 01:54:19,389
Why this riot in the name of love?

1624
01:54:30,108 --> 01:54:31,439
Stop. Stop.

1625
01:54:32,978 --> 01:54:35,105
That's it. Easy. Easy.

1626
01:54:36,247 --> 01:54:38,943
Haji, what's this commotion?

1627
01:54:39,951 --> 01:54:42,579
Bhaskar, you might
remember that your son...

1628
01:54:42,687 --> 01:54:45,121
...gave a gold necklace to
shastri's daughter. - Yes.

1629
01:54:45,490 --> 01:54:49,358
The one her family stole.
- Yes, i remember.

1630
01:54:49,427 --> 01:54:51,224
The necklace was made
of copper, not gold.

1631
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:53,388
That's why this
commotion in the village.

1632
01:54:53,798 --> 01:54:55,026
Copper?

1633
01:54:58,269 --> 01:54:59,634
Son, is that true?

1634
01:55:00,872 --> 01:55:05,434
Yes, father. That's true.

1635
01:55:07,712 --> 01:55:09,907
I accept there was
fault in the necklace.

1636
01:55:12,617 --> 01:55:16,280
But my love was pure.

1637
01:55:17,322 --> 01:55:18,789
One day, suvarna
told me to adorn her...

1638
01:55:18,957 --> 01:55:20,356
...with a necklace made
of ten 'tolas' of gold.

1639
01:55:21,292 --> 01:55:23,157
And then shastri won't
be able to separate us.

1640
01:55:24,329 --> 01:55:25,819
Now you tell me.

1641
01:55:26,598 --> 01:55:28,691
Had i given her a
necklace made of pure gold...

1642
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:31,068
...what would have
happened to me and my family?

1643
01:55:32,237 --> 01:55:33,670
Has anybody thought of that?

1644
01:55:36,474 --> 01:55:37,839
I was surprised.

1645
01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:42,309
As i thought, how could sonu,
who knew about me...

1646
01:55:42,747 --> 01:55:44,510
...and my family's condition very
well, ever ask me of such a thing?

1647
01:55:46,317 --> 01:55:50,913
But she convinced me by saying that
it was only to persuade shastri.

1648
01:55:52,924 --> 01:55:54,551
I had no other option.

1649
01:55:56,027 --> 01:55:57,255
I was afraid.

1650
01:55:58,029 --> 01:55:59,860
If i don't make that necklace...

1651
01:56:00,365 --> 01:56:02,663
...then perhaps i'll
lose sonu forever.

1652
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:07,301
And i didn't want to lose my love.

1653
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:12,171
I thought after shastri agrees...

1654
01:56:12,744 --> 01:56:14,575
...and sonu becomes mine...

1655
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:18,049
...i'll earn and make
her a real gold necklace.

1656
01:56:18,883 --> 01:56:20,874
I never doubted sonu's love.

1657
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:24,320
But the surprising thing was...

1658
01:56:24,522 --> 01:56:25,989
...that upon seeing
the gold necklace...

1659
01:56:26,091 --> 01:56:27,490
...the father and
daughter got greedy.

1660
01:56:31,563 --> 01:56:33,030
Well, forget it now.

1661
01:56:34,232 --> 01:56:37,633
People, who weigh love against
gold, will never understand that.

1662
01:56:40,839 --> 01:56:42,966
I have no complaints
against you, ravi.

1663
01:56:44,109 --> 01:56:48,307
That's why i came to
pierce your kid's ears.

1664
01:56:49,547 --> 01:56:51,640
But i was insulted over there.

1665
01:56:53,518 --> 01:56:58,581
And today, you came to me to
sell the necklace i gave her...

1666
01:56:58,690 --> 01:57:00,385
...saying it came to you as dowry?

1667
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,585
I'm also human.

1668
01:57:06,164 --> 01:57:07,722
Even i get hurt.

1669
01:57:10,502 --> 01:57:13,733
I couldn't tolerate it, so i
told the truth about the necklace.

1670
01:57:17,542 --> 01:57:19,373
Now all of you decide.

1671
01:57:20,378 --> 01:57:22,471
If you think i've made a mistake...

1672
01:57:24,048 --> 01:57:25,640
...then punish me.

1673
01:57:38,396 --> 01:57:40,125
Forgive me, friend.

1674
01:57:51,176 --> 01:57:55,636
Time is witness. God
always stands by the truth.

1675
01:58:28,012 --> 01:58:29,639
Forgive me.

1676
01:58:31,482 --> 01:58:32,676
Sorry.

1677
01:58:48,299 --> 01:58:49,630
Let's go home.

1678
01:59:03,648 --> 01:59:05,479
Shankar, come here.

1679
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:12,886
A father can
understand his son's pain.

1680
01:59:14,592 --> 01:59:16,321
But tell me one thing.

1681
01:59:17,562 --> 01:59:20,963
Where did you learn the skill...

1682
01:59:21,432 --> 01:59:22,956
...of gold-plating copper jewelery?

1683
01:59:24,369 --> 01:59:26,166
Come on, father. Did you forget?

1684
01:59:27,405 --> 01:59:29,703
All the jewelery you gave
mother during your wedding...

1685
01:59:29,807 --> 01:59:31,274
