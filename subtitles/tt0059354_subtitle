1
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,419
Shankar, Parvati,
come here.

2
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,257
For birth of Krishna,have U made
arrangements for the swing?

3
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,454
Yes, the swing has been
decorated, only a silk cord...

4
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,963
...is awaited.

5
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,000
Good, well done. Here! This
Dhoti and Shirt is for you.

6
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,330
What work I will do in the
fields after wearing such...

7
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,600
...fine silk clothes.

8
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,605
With me around, only your
enemies will work in the fields.

9
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:23,338
Don't you have labourers?
Parvati, this set is for you.

10
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:29,049
Brother, does it look all right at
my age to wear such clothes.

11
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,282
If it doesn't look nice on a
princely daughter like you,

12
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,415
...who else will
it look nice on?

13
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,256
Where is your sister in law?
Bhago!

14
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,993
What is it? Why are you
shouting. Call me Bhagwanti.

15
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,535
You won't let me bathe in peace.

16
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,470
I have had my bath. Why
are you giving me another?

17
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,508
Here! Saree for you
for Janamashtmi.

18
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,344
This is a saree from
Nlurshidabad.

19
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,315
That one is from Benares!

20
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:04,150
What will you illiterates know!
Nlurshidabad is ahead of Benares.

21
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,921
If you like this Saree,
you may take it.

22
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,462
Why should she take?
The right of a younger...

23
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,328
...one is first. You
keep it. Go.

24
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:20,994
As if I haven't seen a Benares
Saree! In my house, Benares

25
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,234
...sarees used to be put
on cows during winters!

26
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:27,176
Why not! The place where
Bhagwanti was born, must have...

27
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,841
...belonged to some real lucky
man. I only remember that when...

28
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:37,116
...you came to my house, I had
125 acres of land. And now

29
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,987
...only 100 acres is left.

30
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:44,119
Did I swallow the 25 acres.
If wealth was so dear to you,...

31
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:48,223
...you shouldn't have spent so
much on treating a lame person.

32
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,571
Govind, what has happened?

33
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,905
Where are you?

34
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,111
In the vat!

35
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:12,490
Come out. Good. Tell me,
how did you fall?

36
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:20,197
Today being Krishna's birthday,
I thought I will color the horns...

37
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,996
...of Laxmi. But she gave me
such a kick, I fell into the vat.

38
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,540
See Laxmi, even Tai is laughing.
Green fodder is stopped for...

39
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,406
...you from tomorrow. You will
get only dry grass!

40
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,641
How is Laxmi to be blamed. You
know this cow has come from

41
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,044
...her place. If she doesn't
kick, what else will she do?

42
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,449
Big father, you are
absolutely right!

43
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,489
You have all become strong by
drinking milk of this cow.

44
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,587
Look, go and have a bath,
and come inside.

45
00:05:52,886 --> 00:06:00,202
Brother! God bless you. May
God keep us happy 8. together.

46
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,006
Not only is he my brother, but
my friend and my right hand.

47
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:09,912
I do not have any children,
but when I see Shankar,...

48
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,951
...I feel I am somebody's father!

49
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,179
I am your baby only!

50
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,985
Today is Janamasthmi,
what are you feeding us?

51
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,026
Yes, but only after 12 midnight,
after the birth of Krishna.

52
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:29,364
Come with me! I have brought a
silk Dhoti & shirt specially for U

53
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:35,563
Great! Some girl
will fall for me today!

54
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:42,612
You are spoiling him. Has he got
to take part in sing-song that...

55
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,076
...he has to put on silk clothes!

56
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,414
Come on! Be nice and
talk nice for a change!

57
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:51,945
He is the one born first of our
house, if he does not stay...

58
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,014
...in style who will?

59
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,924
Tau, what a fine reply, Tao.
What do you say now, Tai?

60
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:01,227
I care too hoots for this Uncle
nephew relationship. You would...

61
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,064
...have been better
off in a drama group.

62
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:09,039
Look Tai, you love Shamu so
much, love me a little also.

63
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,235
Go! Don't compare
yourself with Shamu!

64
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:18,272
Sister, I gave birth to Govind &
Shamu. But they are both yours

65
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:22,544
Enough! For me Sham is
adequate. You can keep...

66
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,316
...this lame duck with you.

67
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,324
Bhago, now get away from
here. Ok, I am going.

68
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,621
Why should I waste
my time standing here.

69
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,198
Govind, if Lord Krishna had
known that there are women ...

70
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:40,568
...like Bhagwanti on this earth,
he wouldn't have incarnated here

71
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:45,975
And if after birth, he had seen
my Tai, he would surely have...

72
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:51,209
...forgotten how to play the flute.
Control your tongue. Tai is

73
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,377
...like your mother. One shouldn't
talk like that about her

74
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,047
Brother, you only have
been too lenient with him

75
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,555
That is why he goes and
sits on everybody's head.

76
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:03,890
Yes, keep him in your eyes!
He is the light of my house!

77
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,127
Go and change your clothes!
Ok. I will just come.

78
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:55,946
You are delaying a lot, Nandlal
Brijbala is waiting for you.

79
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:09,884
She is also asking everyone,
where is the one with the flute!

80
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:45,055
No one wants to
go into the forests ...

81
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:48,964
...to pick flower buds
without you

82
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:54,022
All are yearning to hear your
flute on the banks of Yamuna

83
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:11,278
Please manifest yourself now,
don't keep us anxious any more

84
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:46,046
The earth where you were
born is in trouble today.

85
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,886
Fulfil your promise ...

86
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:08,511
Fulfill your word, which you
had given in the Sacred Gita

87
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:18,417
Beside you there is none else
who is the protector of India.

88
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:30,555
Lord Krishna is born!
Hail the Lord!

89
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:34,463
Lord, you have already given me
so much. What should I ask?.

90
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,435
I have this small world,
let it prosper allways

91
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,302
Tau, this is the first
Janamashthmi that Sham has'nt...

92
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:46,401
...attended. Sham's sweets can be
put in a packet and sent to him

93
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:50,446
Should sweets be sent in a
envelope? I had got clothes...

94
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,983
...for him. They have been
despatched to him by post.

95
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,680
Shanker, distribute the sweets!

96
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,586
I will distribute!
Ok, take it.

97
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,096
Mother!
Govind!

98
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,535
Mother, who is this?
Son, this is Radha.

99
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,274
She is the only daughter of
our old friend, Ganga Ram.

100
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:27,546
Her mother died long time back,
and now her father has died.

101
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,554
She will now stay with us.
Mother, You have done an...

102
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,352
...excellent thing. If everyone like
you adopts one orphan each,

103
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,257
...all orphanages of the world
will have to be closed down.

104
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,489
Is everyone in your
house so kind?

105
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,465
Looking at me & mother, you
made this assumption!

106
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,126
Meet my Tai and
then I will ask you.

107
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,067
Come mother, let us go!
Come Radha.

108
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:56,864
In exchange of your boon, I ask
for your kingdom, said Kaikeyi

109
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:08,242
If you consider yourself as a
warrior, keep your word

110
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,338
Ram should not become
the king and should...

111
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,349
...become a servant & go into
exile for 14 years!

112
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:43,520
These words were not words
but poisonous arrows!

113
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:51,586
Raja Dashrath was shaken, and
joining his hands pleaded...

114
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,242
I will give my entire kingdom
to your son, Bharat.

115
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:10,913
But Kaikayi's heart was made of
stone. She insisted that by

116
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:15,050
...ordering Ram into exile
please fulfil your word.

117
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:20,154
Is it true in that age, women
like Kaikayi existed?

118
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:26,226
Don't talk of that age,
today's Kaikayi is at the

119
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,272
...moment standing next to me!

120
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,240
Stop this! Stop this Ramayan!
Who is Dashrath or Kaikayi?.

121
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:34,904
Valmiki had no work or
business. So he started

122
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,344
...penning this story.

123
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:41,010
This is not Valmiki Ramayan.
Priest you may leave now!

124
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,247
Yes, priest you may go. If you
keep listening to her, your faith...

125
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,053
...in Ramayan too may go.
Farewell !

126
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,323
Govind, where were
you since morning?

127
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,627
Tau, I was in the fields.

128
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,670
Tau, mother has come.

129
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,601
Parvati, who is this?

130
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,971
She is the daughter of late Seth
Ganga Ram. After her father's...

131
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:10,947
...death, she has nobody. How
can a young woman stay alone...

132
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:16,419
...so I brought her along with
me. She will help in housework

133
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,116
You have never done an
intelligent thing. Why get such ...

134
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,092
...a girl into your house, who
has consumed her own parents.

135
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,187
Radha, what did I say. As she
opened her mouth, she let off...

136
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,287
...a cracker!

137
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,993
Have you heard what nonsense
is your favourite nephew uttering.

138
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:33,936
He is saying the right thing.
He is simply introducing you.

139
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:39,909
You keep taking his side. Had he
been my son, would he have

140
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,570
...spoken against me like this.

141
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,342
Sister, he is your son only!

142
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:50,217
Great, what a child. You wish
that in my fate too I have a...

143
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:54,520
...son like him. Instead of giving
birth to such a son, it is better..

144
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,323
...That a girl remains unmarried.
If by mistake he gets married,...

145
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,523
...then it is better that
the girl hangs herself.

146
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:06,298
I have been hearing of this
hanging business since ages.

147
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:12,002
Whole life, I have been laughing,
Give me a chance to cry!

148
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:16,410
Enough, if I die, you will
cry for the rest of your life.

149
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:19,211
When will that day
come, just tell me!

150
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:23,982
Look Bhagwanti, Whatever God
does he does it with a lot of...

151
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,320
...thought. When he created a
horse, knowing he is short in...

152
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:32,056
...temper, he hasn't given him
horns. You are a dry river..

153
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,826
If Parvati was not there, who
would have been there to

154
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,093
...continue the family name.

155
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:40,001
She has produced two sons and
she has become a queen in this...

156
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,404
...house. Don't say queen,
say Empress!

157
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,605
Parvati, I accept this girl. From
today she'll stay in this house.

158
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:52,077
God bless you!
Go, take her inside.

159
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,516
Yes, take her.
Lay a bed for her.

160
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,576
She is the daughter
of a big house!

161
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:02,786
Those who care for orphans
have the hand of God on them.

162
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:06,922
What will she take from here.
If it is her fate, she'll eat here.

163
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,091
Yes, feed her well

164
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,431
Tau, you are great!

165
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:19,242
Mother, for me you had
to listen to all this.

166
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:23,576
What difference does it make if
an elder sister says something...

167
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,282
...to a younger sister.

168
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,010
Mother, does this elder sister
always talk like this?

169
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:32,921
I don't feel bad if she
says anything against me.

170
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:40,292
But when she...
Understood.

171
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:45,359
Mother can tolerate anything, but
can't hear a bad word against...

172
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:52,399
...her son. Mother, was
your son like this from birth?

173
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:57,465
No. When he was 8-9 years old
he was a sweet lad. Then one...

174
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:10,411
...day his kite got entangled on
an electric pole. When he went...

175
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:24,330
...to retrieve it, he was
eloctrocuted and his hand, legs...

176
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:29,397
...were damaged. Since then we
have visited numerous doctors...

177
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:42,977
...but of no avail. We couldn't
do anything to help.

178
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:58,908
I am shocked to hear this. Is
an electric shock so strong?

179
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:08,919
Yes, it brings light to the world,
but here it brought darkness.

180
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:13,320
Radha, don't listen to mother.
She keeps abusing electricity...

181
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,588
...day and night. The whole
village has electricity but in this.

182
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:21,029
...Biggest house we have oil
lamps. I was mauled, and she...

183
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,089
...cut the house electric
connection. If there was no

184
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,602
...electricity how would have
these factories functioned?

185
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,332
How would have
these mills run?

186
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:32,536
And yes, millions travel by train.
Sometimes there are accidents.

187
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,374
Does it mean we stop
travelling by train?

188
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:42,511
I wonder by such arguments,
whom does he convince.

189
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:49,085
Mother, there is such enthusiasm
& hope in your son's talk!

190
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:51,128
Then why are you sounding
so despondent?

191
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,926
Hey you girl, you talk too big!
What work do you have here?

192
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:58,958
What ever you order!
No one orders here. Mother...

193
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:03,440
...has brought you here so that
you decorate this house with...

194
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:06,238
...love and affection and keep my
mother so engaged that she

195
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,278
...stops worrying about me!

196
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:14,546
Radha, consider this as your own
house and add to the harmony.

197
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,487
Mother, speak softly. If
Tau hears this, she will be...

198
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,023
...sent packing today itself.

199
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,324
What is it? I have
come to bathe you!

200
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,232
How did the sun rise
from the west today?

201
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,636
The sun may rise from anywhere.
My duty is to serve you!

202
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:41,174
Hold it! Stand in front!
Yes, at ease.

203
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,611
When did you change
your religion?

204
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,981
Tell me what work
have you got?

205
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,145
Just now the postman
has delivered a letter.

206
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,916
Is Sham coming?

207
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:56,483
No, my brother's son, Navrangi
Lal and his sister Neelima are...

208
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,051
...coming from Singapore.

209
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,222
Have they left Singapore?

210
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:03,392
Yes, they have. They are
about to reach India.

211
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,171
My skin is burnt! Burnt!

212
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:10,104
Water is absolutely cold, so
how has your skin burnt?

213
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:14,872
Water is cold, but hearing you,
my heart has started burning.

214
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,313
Go ahead, what else has
your Navrangi Lal written?

215
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,648
He has written that though he
has a 100 places where he can...

216
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:27,517
...stay, he wants to stay with
me. And after all, after my

217
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,060
...brothers death, who
has he got except me.

218
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,528
What else has he written?

219
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:36,431
He has written how is brother
in law. How is his health?

220
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:40,437
I am coming after 20 years.
Perhaps he won't even...

221
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,995
...recognise me.

222
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:47,477
It is not difficult to recognise
people from your family. It is...

223
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,140
...written on their faces.
- Tell me what should I write?

224
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,479
Write whatever you
want. Pour the water.

225
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,577
But what should I
write on your behalf.

226
00:22:56,642 --> 00:23:00,317
Write Brother in law is having a
bath. And that you are pouring...

227
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,521
...water on my back with love,
but he feels that someone...

228
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,585
...is stabbing him from
the back.

229
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:11,029
Stop fooling.
Should I call them?

230
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:16,506
Why are you wasting a 4 paise
card! They will land up here,...

231
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:24,879
...I will just inform the villagers
that Navrangi Lal is coming.

232
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:30,114
...Please latch your doors,
and then go to sleep at night!

233
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,383
You haven't changed!

234
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:17,560
Manmauji, this is my fatherlandl
Call it your motherland.

235
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:22,868
No. My father was an Indian,
but my mother was from Goa.

236
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:26,307
If they had married after Goa's
independence, I would have

237
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:30,370
...called myself an Indian. I am
half foreign and half Indian.

238
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:34,441
Neelima, my sister. Come, I
will show you my fatherlandl

239
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,958
Where are you going?

240
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,867
To the fair!

241
00:24:55,594 --> 00:25:00,441
Let me take you to the fair,
whole town is mad after you.

242
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:05,209
Looking at your beauty,
world should'nt defame you

243
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,117
Don't think I am innocent,
my beauty is a pill of poison.

244
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:15,249
Don't you dare to take my name.
you group of mad lovers!

245
00:25:56,155 --> 00:26:00,433
If your veil slips,
your tresses spread out!

246
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:05,339
If you gaze down,
your beauty blossoms.

247
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,253
The whole world is after me,
I am just fed up, but...

248
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:30,926
...I am still an unmarried lady
come somebody take my name.

249
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:25,953
In the eyes of the world,
my youth stands out!

250
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:31,154
I wonder how many hearts,
are dangling on my nose ring!

251
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:51,047
Since you are in your 16th year,
your whole body has awakened.

252
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:56,280
And all with a heart are running
after you, and nobody works!

253
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,131
Why are you dancing like
monkeys by the road side.

254
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,866
You clown, are you trying
to make fun of us!

255
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,067
Don't you know it
is a rural dance?

256
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:55,271
What rural dance? With such
beautiful girls, you are...

257
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:58,406
...just raising hands and dancing
separately! One boy and one

258
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,314
...girl, and hands around the
waist. Wait, I will show you.

259
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:06,288
I wonder whose dress you
have stolen! Shut up

260
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,086
Manmauji, just tell
him, who am I?

261
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,491
I know you. From your face you
look like a crow, and you have...

262
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,085
...a bearing just like
that of a donkey.

263
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,196
Leave him, Govind. He does not
know the village ethics. He is...

264
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,894
...a foreigner. Who are you?
Is that a pig tail!

265
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,836
Sir, take care or else these
villagers will bury you alive...

266
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,067
...in these sugarcane fields.

267
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,303
Sugarcane fields!
Manmauji get my gun!

268
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,817
Now sir, do your calculations
and tell us what does future...

269
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,219
...hold for this house now?

270
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,851
Ok, take any day's name.
Saturday.

271
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:46,988
In my calculations too
saturn is only coming.

272
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,026
I think Narangi has come!
Narangi!

273
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,571
My Aunt!

274
00:29:55,627 --> 00:30:00,440
You just now said, Saturn is
coming. Yes, he has come!

275
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,916
Priest please go. It shouldn't
happen that you too get eclipsed.

276
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,576
Go from here! Go!

277
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,918
I am seeing you after ages.
You have become Ieaner, but...

278
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,980
...you are as sweet as before.

279
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:19,018
Narangi, my fortunes have
opened today. God bless you.

280
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:22,998
Greetings, Auntie. Neelima,
you are grown so big!

281
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:27,367
If my brother was alive, he
would have seen in what grand...

282
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:31,670
...style they are living.
And him? Is he her husband?

283
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:36,368
Auntie, you talk like a child.
Can we ever get Neelima...

284
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:39,678
...married without asking you?
He is Manmauji, my secretary.

285
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:42,977
Meaning an aide de camp
Understood, an accountant!

286
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,681
Yes. God bless you.
Sir, the taxi fare!

287
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:50,257
My god, I forgot. Do you have
Rs 20? I have Singapore notes.

288
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,023
They can be exchanged
at the bank only.

289
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:55,895
Why Rs. 20? I have several such
amounts. Give! I will count

290
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,560
...it myself. Here is your
fare. go.

291
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:02,003
You just stay here. As a good
omen, let me put some oil on..

292
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,368
...The fire.

293
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:09,236
Have you seen, Manmauji?
What a grand reception our...

294
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,214
...Auntie has accorded to
us. But sir, you got a...

295
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,648
...welcome at the fair also!
Don't act smart!

296
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,409
Come inside children!

297
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:21,356
Manmauji take baggage inside.
Auntie has a good house.

298
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:25,327
It is old but as good as the Taj
Mahal! Who is this old man?

299
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:29,855
I am one who married your
aunt when she was young.

300
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,996
Auntie, I had told you so many
times in my letter, cut our...

301
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,302
...uncle's head!
What did you say?

302
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,969
I meant to cut off that tail,
what do you call it here?

303
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:45,140
We call it Chutiya. Yes,
chutiya, and give him a hair cut.

304
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:49,515
My Navrangi is giving
you such good advice.

305
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:54,922
What are you looking at. These
children have come from so far.

306
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,553
Extend your hand in blessings!
He has already soiled it by...

307
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:02,064
...shaking my hand earlier.
I will go & wash it. Go!

308
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,067
Auntie, I will correct him
totally before I leave.

309
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,638
Auntie, who are these people?
He is my brother in law,

310
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:15,504
...and this is his elder son!
You have such bad stars!

311
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,478
Do you know how they
behaved with me at the fair?

312
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,480
What happened, son?

313
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,881
They tried to strangle me.
I will let the dog after them.

314
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,648
See! My brother's son has come
and enroute only you started to...

315
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,948
...beat and misbehave with him!

316
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,551
My god, they have turned out to
be relatives! Let us forget about..

317
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,927
...Fighting. Go and wash your
face, today Auntie has made a

318
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:41,130
...lot of delicacies for you. And
uncle has made some sweets...

319
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,969
made of grass etc! Please
control your tongue.

320
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,202
They are Auntie's relatives.
So I am just fooling around!

321
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:50,474
Why are you wasting time
with them, let us go up.

322
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,846
Auntie the place is good,
but there is no electricity.

323
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,619
Now that you have come, we
will have lights all over!

324
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,299
That is all right. See what
I have brought for you.

325
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:18,374
See that horse.
And this is a monkey.

326
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,173
He drinks Scotch.
Drinks scotch?

327
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:27,513
Scotch means grape wine!
Aha! grape juice!

328
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:33,318
How many kids do you have?
All I have is only you

329
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:37,087
That is there, but uncle has
turned out to be quite a miser.

330
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:40,619
He didn't give you one kid!
See how many toys I have...

331
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,856
...brought for your children.
Gopi, I am sure your brother...

332
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,493
...in law has done something.
- But he has two sons.

333
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,439
One is that lame boy and other
is Sham. He studies in city..

334
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:57,208
He is very good. He listens to
meHe listens to you? Yes!

335
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:01,081
Then he'll be of some use some
day. The world has gone ahead

336
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,586
And our world is going
backwards. By cows and goats...

337
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,256
...all staying under one roof,
politics is surely encouraged.

338
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:12,386
Abroad, as soon as a child is
born, he is handed over to nurse.

339
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:16,263
He drinks bottle milk and grows.
As soon as he grows, he gets...

340
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,824
...a room. And once he gets
married, he gets a house!

341
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,234
And when ever he desires, he
goes and meet mom and dad!

342
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:28,370
Does it happen like that
abroad? Here it is the opposite.

343
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:33,143
I cook, and everybody eats!
That brother n law, that lame...

344
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,557
Navrangi, listen to me, what
are you looking out at?

345
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,583
Who is this girl? is she your
brother in law's daughter?

346
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:48,859
No, she is a servant! -
Great, she is more beautiful...

347
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,365
...than the household people.
What is her name?

348
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,335
Radha. I wonder where
have they picked her from.

349
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,304
She is an orphan. Auntie, so
what if she is an orphan!

350
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,398
Come, why are you wasting
your time discussing a servant.

351
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,034
Neelima, your brother has
made his first move!

352
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:06,879
You don't understand. This house
is an institution. And I am a

353
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:11,512
...new student. And that is why I
must understand each thing here.

354
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:19,023
Navrangi, I don't have an issue
Do whatever pleases you

355
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:22,463
Auntie, don't you worry. I will
completely change the...

356
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,625
...complexion of people here.
These gold ornaments of yours...

357
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,335
...none of it will
stay. What?

358
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,894
I mean, now I will make
ornaments of pearls!

359
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,376
Son, today my heart is at peace.
Now give me your word.

360
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:39,506
You and Neelima will not
leave this house, till I die.

361
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,851
Auntie, I have come from
afar for this purpose only.

362
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,150
Auntie just touch my head
with affectionGod bless you.

363
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:35,431
Clouds flying in the blue skies,
please come here and...

364
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:40,402
...bring shade to our fields
burning in the sun.

365
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:46,033
You hidden birds in
the fields, go, go away!

366
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:51,240
The grain is yet too raw,
when it ripens, you may eat.

367
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:29,919
The cool waters flowing
in the beds!

368
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:45,992
What if they kiss your feet,
oh, queen of the fields!

369
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:53,271
Kissing my feet it will become
mine. I am a slave of the fields..

370
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,312
...And you are the king.

371
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:34,608
May the Lord protect
these green fields

372
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:50,431
A single grain produces
a million if Lord wishes.

373
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:55,437
The lord listens to those
who work hard.

374
00:39:55,493 --> 00:40:00,499
Keep your arms open,
the Lord will fill it up.

375
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:40,109
What to do, this is a local
biscuit. There is no butcher's

376
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,310
...shop in the village. Otherwise
I would have got meat for you.

377
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:46,321
Let some money come, I will get
you tinned meat from the city.

378
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,589
Manmauji, is this
a time to sleep?

379
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,292
Come on, go out! Can't you see,
she has come to sweep!

380
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:59,631
Good you woke me up, else I
would have been swept out!

381
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,873
I saw a broom is a delicate
hand. It is like seeing a potato...

382
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,239
...on a flowering tree!

383
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,372
Your eyes are so intoxicating,
and the face so titillating.

384
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:15,884
And on top she sweeps!
What an insult to beauty.

385
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,322
Please look this side!
Speak please!

386
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:25,623
Why are you punishing yourself?
This age, this height this beauty.

387
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,955
If you say it, I will get rid
of this broom for you forever!

388
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:32,434
What can't you do, if you so
wish! You are a big man.

389
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,439
Radha, you have recognised me.
From the time I have entered

390
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,102
...this house, no one has called
me a big man. Radha, how did...

391
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,872
...you recognise I
was a big man?

392
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:47,314
Big men are recognised by their
face only. These finely stitched...

393
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:52,412
...clothes, your posture, your
style...if you give biscuits to

394
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:55,048
...your dog, I wonder what
you must be eating!

395
00:41:55,113 --> 00:42:00,620
I respect your judgement. Just
imagine if I can give biscuits...

396
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:04,561
...to dogs, what all can I give
you. I can change these cheap...

397
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:09,571
...cotton clothes to those of silk.
And your dry lips with lipstick...

398
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,265
...will look like burning red fire.

399
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:14,970
And your hair, will become curly.
You understand what I am saying

400
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:20,039
Take it that your days have
changed. The days of poverty...

401
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:24,382
...are gone! Did it go
away from this door?

402
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:27,389
Yes. I closed it, so that
it doesn't return!

403
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:32,292
Close the door properly.
And put the latch, lest ...

404
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,886
...somebody listen.

405
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:48,206
Govind, what noise is this?

406
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:52,271
They say, Lord's stick does
not make noise. Yet I do hear it

407
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,614
Let us see what is happening!
Leave it, the meeting must...

408
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:05,885
...be getting over.
Radha, have you sweeped?

409
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,486
Radha, what was
happening on top?

410
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:10,396
You don't have much brains. Cant
you see the broom in her hand?

411
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:15,905
She has swept everything there!
- Is that so? God bless you!

412
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,342
Auntie! Autie!
What happened, son?

413
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:27,543
Ask what has not happened!
Speak son!

414
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,848
What will he say? If it was
worth speaking, he would have.

415
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,320
By his tone understand
what happened!

416
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:35,415
Auntie, you pour the oil,
and he ignites it!

417
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,982
I can't stay here even for
a minute here, now.

418
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:39,961
Since you have come, this is the
first time you talked sense.

419
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:41,429
After all what has
happened brother?

420
00:43:41,486 --> 00:43:44,626
Nothing and everything. Now
even my dog won't stay here.

421
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:47,268
Your dog is smarter than
you. He has already left.

422
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:52,131
What is the hurry. Wait for
some more time.

423
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:56,235
Why are you stopping him. He is
leaving at an auspicious time.

424
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,608
Let him go!

425
00:43:57,669 --> 00:44:00,206
Yes, I'm going. But I hadn't
consulted astrologers to go.

426
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:03,150
Come Neelima, Manmouji,
get the suitcases!

427
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,321
Farewell to you!

428
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:18,829
You had given me a word. Till I
die, you will not go from here.

429
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,335
Neelima, are you also going?
Yes! Where my brother is not...

430
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:26,102
...respected, I cannot stay there.
Me too. I cannot stay here.

431
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:35,144
Sham, you have come at the
right time, son.

432
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:38,085
See, here is my Sham.

433
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:42,147
His mother gave him birth,
but he is my son!

434
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,318
Auntie, who are these people?

435
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:48,057
They are my brother's children.
He is Navrangi. Hello.

436
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,396
And this is Neelimal
Neelimal

437
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:56,132
She often used to remember you,
that her brother;s daughte...

438
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,002
...lives in Singapore.
Yes.

439
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,166
Did your Auntie ever remember
me? Oh, yes.

440
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:07,113
Shamu, you have come. I would
have come to the station with

441
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,411
...vehicle to receive you.

442
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:12,453
Oh, man from Singapore. Here is
my brother. You used to throw

443
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,081
...your English at me. Calling me
fool and a rascal! Govind!

444
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:18,286
Don't interfere. Sham, give
him a few abuses in English!

445
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:22,889
Will you keep quiet now. Sham,
these people have come to stay...

446
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:25,935
...with us from such a distance
but these illiterates have really...

447
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,628
...made a nuisance
of themselves here.

448
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:31,269
Guests, and going away annoyed,
how can that happen?

449
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,969
It is good I came. Now they
will not go anywhere.

450
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,875
With great difficulty they are
going. Don't stop them, Shamu

451
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,073
Seen? What is the difference
between an educated man, and...

452
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:42,174
...an illiterate? Have
you seen that?

453
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,020
You are two brothers but how
different from each other!

454
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:49,183
Besides you and Auntie,
rest are all shepherds are.

455
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,625
Yes, we are! But we
are not thieves like you.

456
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:56,025
Come, let us meet mother,
she is anxious to meet you.

457
00:45:58,322 --> 00:45:59,892
What are you staring at
that colored parrot for?

458
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,801
We cannot do that. After
all, they are our guests.

459
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:08,808
I don't feel like, but since a
decent person is calling us...

460
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,437
...with so much love,
I cannot refuse. What do you

461
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,209
...say Neelima.
Ok, brother.

462
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,545
Manmauji, take back
the baggage.

463
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,609
Shamu, when did you come?
Just now Uncle.

464
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:21,551
Since last one hour he is
outside, but these people...

465
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,991
...did not leave him at all.

466
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:28,155
You have returned! We have'nt
come, but were called

467
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:31,359
You go ahead, I will meet mother
and come in five minutes.

468
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,969
What is happening to Sham. He
is delaying to meet mother!

469
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:45,947
Father, see who has come!
Sham, welcome.

470
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,942
Mother!
God bless you.

471
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:53,045
You look so pulled down.
He must not be getting...

472
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,612
...milk and curd in the city.

473
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:59,351
Mother, we get everything there.
But to parents the son always..

474
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:01,226
...Looks pulled down after
a long separation!

475
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,923
Come, sit down!

476
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:05,467
How are your studies getting
along. You will surely pass?!

477
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:08,470
Is this anything to ask.
He will come first!

478
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:14,075
Radha, this is my Shamu.
Get him a glass of buttermilk.

479
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:18,342
Mother, why were Navrangi and
Neelima going away so soon?

480
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:22,043
They are going, son.
This is not good mother.

481
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:26,020
If I hadn't interfered they would
have already departed!

482
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:29,957
Shamu, with great difficulty they
were going, but U stopped them.

483
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:34,485
Those crooks were going out
you brought them down!

484
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:38,625
See, mother, how does brother
talk about them! They will think...

485
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:43,134
...we are illiterate fools!
Let them think like that!

486
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:47,472
Who bothers about them.
Govind, will you keep quiet!

487
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:52,306
That Navrangi is coming,
take Sham inside.

488
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:56,944
Sham you said you are coming in
a minute, it is now more than

489
00:47:57,008 --> 00:47:59,511
...half an hour now. You are an
educated man. Keep your time.

490
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:01,386
Why are you spoiling
my clothes?

491
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,982
Sham let us go to the roof,
what cool breeze is blowing.

492
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:09,259
You go! Shamu has come home
after such a long time. Will you..

493
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,298
...Leave us alone in peace!

494
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:13,358
Horrible. In this house no one
respects an educated person.

495
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:18,396
Sham, Neelima is waiting
alone on top! Why alone?

496
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:21,807
The dog is there! Mother,
please advise brother.

497
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:25,313
Shamu, nobody can do it, I
say whatever I feel like.

498
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:34,823
You should have
stopped Sham.

499
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:38,986
What's the use. He is grown up.
He should understand what is...

500
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,324
...good and bad for him.

501
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:44,833
Father, I will say one thing. In
their company there is nothing

502
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:47,062
...good, and he will lose his
way.

503
00:48:48,893 --> 00:48:51,430
Mother, keep a close watch on
Shamu. If he gets trapped...

504
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:53,566
...by these, everything
will get spoiled

505
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,885
Neelima was becoming tired
of waiting for you, Sham...

506
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:09,948
She became mad, the moment
she set her eyes on Sham...

507
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:14,292
Since we have come to this
village, there are either Babool...

508
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,491
...trees or nitwits of this house.

509
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:21,429
Looking at you it appears as if
from a dry mountain side, a

510
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:26,805
...spring has welled up! Tell me,
are you fond of a shoot!

511
00:49:26,864 --> 00:49:29,936
Why not, make a
programme! We will go!

512
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,315
But what hunt? Tiger, Ieapord,
deer, rabbit, partridge or.. beer.

513
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:39,320
Whatever you desire. Idea
is to have a good time.

514
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:42,983
Time will be well spent,
now that you have come.

515
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:47,086
You chit chat. I will find out
where one gets good game.

516
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,153
You go and take
the dog for a walk.

517
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,331
Sit down!

518
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,635
Has your exam
started? No.

519
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:06,872
But my exam has
started. Meaning?

520
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:13,354
I am trying to study. On the
face is written, that the heart..

521
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:16,915
...Must be equally beautiful.
So you are trying to read me.

522
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:21,995
Parvati's status has raised
in status as she has two kids

523
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:26,592
All at home only respect her.
Everyone who comes, keep

524
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:33,074
...singing her praises. My name is
Bhagwanti! If I don't teach them..

525
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,132
...A lesson, then my
birth is wasted!

526
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,339
Auntie I will tell you
a way! What is it?

527
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:43,451
Sit down! Sham is an educated
boy. He has seen the glitter of...

528
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,283
...the new age in the city. Why
not seal a relationship with...

529
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:49,553
...Neelima. She will bear over him
like a heavy cloud after marriage

530
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,594
Children will be born, and they
will get right over the property.

531
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,631
And who will give a girl to that
lame duck. We can snatch

532
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:58,496
...his share too.
Genius! Wait I will put a

533
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,969
...black mark on you, so that
no one casts an evil eye on you.

534
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,300
But why a black spot?
For what?

535
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,466
So that your enemies don't
cast any evil on you.

536
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:17,152
Wow, you are brushing your
teeth in the english way!

537
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:21,987
Ok, get ready fast. Mother is
calling you for breakfast.

538
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:25,186
No need to come here. You
could have called me from there.

539
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:28,594
If I have come so far, what
problems have come to me?

540
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:36,064
Shamu, you did not get anything
from the city for me.

541
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:43,044
You forgot Govind. Perhaps you
had to come in a hurry.

542
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,638
Shamu, may I take out
water for a bath for you?

543
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:58,226
I am quite mad. I promised you
water, but how will I pull out...

544
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,125
...the bucket from the well.

545
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:02,061
I will take out the water
for the little master!

546
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,962
Yes, Radha you do this work.

547
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:07,298
Shamu, hurry. Mom is making
hot buttered bread!

548
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,469
Mom is right. Sham has
in fact become quite weak.

549
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:22,846
Govind, what're you doing. Can't
Sham sit down & have breakfast

550
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:26,444
Mom, you don't know these
college kids. They sit on chairs...

551
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,649
...and have breakfast
on a table. You go!

552
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:36,456
Come, breakfast is waiting
for you on the top.

553
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,434
Mom has made my breakfast.
Everyone is waiting for me.

554
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:45,907
I love potato paratha.
Whenever I come home, Mom...

555
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:47,306
...makes them for me
whenever I come.

556
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:50,345
After studying so much, you are
still hung on these rustic dishes!

557
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:55,111
Poor Neelima has laid the table
with such care and love.

558
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,913
Come let us go up!

559
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,498
Govind, you go ahead
and have breakfast.

560
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:15,299
How long will you wait?
Should I eat alone? I will

561
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:21,901
...wait for Shamu to come.
Radha, Is Shamu still bathing?

562
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:25,140
He has already had his bath.
Now he is having his breakfast.

563
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:30,880
Breakfast?
Yes, with them

564
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:41,462
Mom, I told you keep an eye on
Shamu. Those who came only...

565
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,361
...yesterday are now
more dear to him.

566
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,163
I will take breakfast to him.
I will see how he doesn't eat.

567
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,899
Son, why do you wish to
get involved with them.

568
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,965
I am just going to
my younger brother.

569
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:58,502
He hasn't eaten anything.
- Neelima too hasn't eaten.

570
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,242
I think they are satiated
just looking at each other.

571
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,214
What have you brought?
Not for you.

572
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:08,086
If you don't like sitting down
and eating then eat here only..

573
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:10,125
This has been made by mom,
with her own hands.

574
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:12,126
But he has already eaten!
Girl. don't interfere...

575
00:54:12,183 --> 00:54:13,218
...when two men are talking

576
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,627
Brother, if I had breakfast for
one day with them, what is

577
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:16,593
...the harm?

578
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,996
If you eat, mother's heart will
bless you, and if you don't ...

579
00:54:21,058 --> 00:54:22,469
...it will curse you.

580
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:25,564
Really? If that be so, keep the
plate here. The dog will eat it.

581
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:28,439
What are you standing
here for. Go away!

582
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:32,276
Since I have come, I am stuck
here like a prisoner. Why not...

583
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:36,216
...go out for a change? Yes,
Sham, it is a good idea. Go.

584
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,310
You can go now!

585
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:06,571
Come, let us dance.
Let us romance!

586
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:10,274
Our lives have been
decided when our eyes met.

587
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:43,008
Life is dull, But in a
second it can be beautiful.

588
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:47,613
Just do me a favor,
and make my life green!

589
00:56:01,292 --> 00:56:05,468
I am a traveller from afar,
but I am at your service.

590
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:09,978
I seek the dense shade,
off your dark tresses.

591
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:13,447
My heart too is
thirsty for you!

592
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:57,291
The weather is ideal for love
and romance.

593
00:56:57,347 --> 00:57:02,126
Then why shouldn't life
appear so joyful.

594
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:19,845
Leave the world which may try
and obstruct our love but...

595
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:24,511
...I am quite clear on my
intent, what about you?

596
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:28,113
My heart too is thirsty
for you, my beloved.

597
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:44,930
You saw Shankar, this was our
Shamu. How shameful. Just...

598
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:50,104
...no consideration of
family name. No care!

599
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:51,475
He is having such an open
affair with this girl!

600
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:57,110
Yes, brother. The matter has
crossed all limits. God guide us.

601
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,977
Shankar, do you remember?
Harprasad of Nlotichur had

602
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:03,514
...sought a relationship for his
two daughters last year?.

603
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,221
If Shamu is ready to marry his
younger daughter, then he is ...

604
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:10,128
...prepared to get his elder
daughter married to Govind.

605
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:13,430
That time we had
avoided this issue.

606
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,302
Yes, but now to save Shamu and
get a bride for Govind too,

607
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:22,309
...I think we should
agree to his terms.

608
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:25,973
I will go to Nlotichur tomorrow
itself and finalise the deal.

609
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:36,355
What do these oldies know, that
Sham has already been auctioned.

610
00:58:42,286 --> 00:58:46,166
Auntie, get up and alert yourself.
What is the matter, Navrangi.

611
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:49,830
Those two oldies are planning to
put our plans in cold storage!

612
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:54,069
What? Yes, I heard it
with my own ears!

613
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:56,077
They are finalising Shams
marriage with a daughter...

614
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:58,204
...of some landlord of Nlotichur.

615
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:02,307
Till I am alive,
why are you afraid.

616
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:06,946
I am not even afraid of God.
But to get alerted at the sign...

617
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,355
...of danger is a sign of
intelligence. All moves on the...

618
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:13,452
...chessboard of this house are
against us. You can control only..

619
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:16,088
...One pawn Sham which you
can move around and win.

620
00:59:16,153 --> 00:59:19,225
If he gets away from our hands,
it means our defeat and...

621
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,825
...victory to our enemies.

622
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,427
What have you thought
of, Navrangi?

623
00:59:22,493 --> 00:59:26,100
I have thought of everything.
I am looking for an opportunity.

624
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:30,805
I will put such an explosive, this
house will be smashed to bits.

625
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,143
And the biggest
piece will be...Ours!

626
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,511
Radha!
Coming!

627
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,351
What is this? You have mixed
my clothes with these dirty ones.

628
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,124
They are not coarse
cotton, but pure silk!

629
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:52,599
Watch out, don't wash my
clothes with this local soap.

630
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:55,064
Where have they got this
country pumpkin from?

631
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:59,471
Pardon me, but this is the
tradition of this house.

632
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:03,170
All clothes will be washed
together. I will wash yours...

633
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:04,610
...once again.

634
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:08,647
Radha, what has happened to
you. Our clothes are clothes...

635
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:12,217
...of decent folks. Why have you
mixed such rotten clothes with

636
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,346
...ours. Do you wish us
to soil our religion?

637
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:17,858
How dare you? For a two penny
servant, you are insulting me!

638
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:22,430
Don't dare call Radha a servant!
Here there is no servant.

639
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:24,625
From today she will not
wash your clothes. Pick up...

640
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,266
...your clothes, and
wash them yourself!

641
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:29,532
Which hell has my brother got
me. I'll just teach you a lesson.

642
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:36,033
Yes, go ahead. See Radha, here
you gain nothing by keeping quiet.

643
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:40,377
What are you simply staring
at? Wash your clothes.

644
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:45,910
There is no place for me. I feel
suffocated here. Why stay in

645
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,617
...such a house. Sham, do you
wish I be treated like a servant?

646
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:56,961
What is the matter? What
can it be. Your brother...

647
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,500
...wishes that I wash
my clothes myself.

648
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:03,629
Let my people say anything.
You are concerned with me.

649
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:07,569
Look this side. I wish to make
you mine for my life

650
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:13,203
...rudely with my sister.

651
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:17,480
And your brother is no less.
He too is trying to be nasty.

652
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:21,990
Get one thing clear. Nobody
bothers about you. And nobody...

653
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:27,188
...listens to your auntie! In such
condition how can we stay here!

654
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,356
Is that so? We will decide
on it today itself!

655
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,204
You have insulted Neelimal

656
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:44,342
Then should Radha take
insults from her?

657
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:46,005
Has now Radha become
Neelima's equal?

658
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,639
Do you know who Neelima is?

659
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,545
I do not. But if you
know, then tell me.

660
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:54,555
Then hear me. Neelima is half
mistress of this place.

661
01:01:54,611 --> 01:02:00,618
Mistress? Wah, Shamu. I don't
think you eat opium nuggets.

662
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,592
Brother, I am going
to marry Neelima.

663
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,329
Sham, what is it?

664
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,096
Aunt, this marriage should as
conducted as early a spossible..

665
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:11,264
Sham, are you finalising
your own marriage?

666
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:17,506
Till now I am alive. In addition
my father like elder brother...

667
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,171
...is also there.

668
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:24,049
I know. How can Neelima get
married to Sham? She is my...

669
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:28,886
...brother's daughter. They
hate my family since birth

670
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:33,018
When did I say that Sham and
Neelima cannot get married.

671
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,461
If you like this
relationship then...

672
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:41,265
This marriage cannot take place.
We cannot forget our traditions.

673
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:45,864
In this house who ever has got
married has done it with the

674
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,205
...consent of elders. When Govind
is still a bachelor, how can...

675
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,642
...the younger one get married.

676
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:52,540
But the country I come from, the
younger brother does not wait...

677
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,445
...for the elder to get married.

678
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:58,111
Don't forget, at the moment you
are in India. Get lost now!

679
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:04,614
So Shamu, you will remain a
bachelor till your handsome

680
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:05,952
...brother does not get married.

681
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:10,431
And no father will be so cruel,
that he gives his daughters

682
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:14,264
...hand in marriage who cannot
even hold her hand.

683
01:03:14,324 --> 01:03:17,328
But may be a person, who
wants to rid oneself of girl...

684
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:21,035
...might agree. Listen to me.
Take priesthood.

685
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:25,375
Since ages India has not had a
saint. And life without marriage...

686
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:28,882
...is like a car without petrol!
Perhaps you can marry after

687
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:32,943
...your elder brother's death.
But he may not die for the next..

688
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:36,513
...25 to 50 years. He massages
himself with oil and eats well

689
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:40,084
Neither can he get married, nor...

690
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,131
...will he die earlier.
So become a priest!

691
01:03:56,633 --> 01:04:00,240
You will remain a bachelor till
your elder handsome brother...

692
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:05,116
...gets married. There will be no
father who will willingly give...

693
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:12,389
...his daughter's hand in his. But
if there is some body under

694
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:17,330
...compulsion, he may benefit.
Become a priest. As it is, ...

695
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:20,527
...there hasn't been a saint in
India for ages. Or you can

696
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:24,834
...marry after your elder brothers
death. But he is not going to

697
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:32,870
...die easily. He massages himself
with oil and eats good food.

698
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:36,884
So neither is he going to get
married nor is he going to die...

699
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,317
...soon. So become a priest!

700
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:36,502
What were you going to do?

701
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:44,041
Nothing Radha. I was looking
into the well to see if the

702
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,280
...waters will accept me.

703
01:05:51,648 --> 01:05:55,960
You used to laugh off the
biggest problems, then how...

704
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:57,999
...did you think of
committing suicide?

705
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:06,098
If somebody gains from my death
it is not called suicide.

706
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:11,162
My life won't benefit anone on
this earth. Then why should I...

707
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,049
...be an obstruction to others.
Shamu is of a marriagable age...

708
01:06:23,113 --> 01:06:29,359
...but he cannot marry
till I get married!

709
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:36,200
And I cannot get married. Then
why should I snatch my

710
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:38,569
...brother's happiness.

711
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:43,202
But why have you thought that
you cannot get married.

712
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:48,266
He may be a bad man, but what
ever he said is entirely true.

713
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,926
Who will give his girl to me?
Which girl will wish to wed me

714
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:07,299
Why? I am lame
and handicapped!

715
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:15,941
Why should I spoil
any innocent girl's life?

716
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:20,573
Instead of being a support, why
should I be a liability on her.

717
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:26,277
Till today I have not sinned, and
will not do so in the future.

718
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:34,091
Radha, truly speaking I
do not wish to marry!

719
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:39,395
Is that your final decision?
What else is left?

720
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:55,944
Then permit me. I will go very
far from here Why Radha?

721
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:03,241
I thought I will stay here,
serve somebody. But it appears...

722
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:14,196
...nobody needs me. What is the
use of my staying here now.

723
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:21,472
Radha, I have understood. But I
don't wish for anyone's pity.

724
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:27,413
Since you have come, you look
after me. You help me.

725
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:34,115
But I do not wish to punish you
for the favors you have done.

726
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:42,588
Don't do such a favor, that
under its heavy load I die.

727
01:08:44,554 --> 01:08:51,972
I am not doing any favor. If you
give me a place at your feet...

728
01:08:52,028 --> 01:09:00,880
...my good days will return.
Otherwise I am an orphan. I've...

729
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:09,152
...no place. I will simply
remember the good times I have..

730
01:09:09,212 --> 01:09:11,783
...Had in this house and cry
by myself and spend my life

731
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:16,024
Radha, why do you wish to bring
darkness in your life in order to..

732
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,996
...Bring light into mine?

733
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,162
See this!
And see this!

734
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:31,138
This hand cannot work.
It cannot protect you.

735
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:37,444
After marriage, a husband's job
is to protect his wife. But you

736
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:42,507
...wish to place your future in
one who is crying & will...

737
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:50,056
...make others cry.

738
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:55,467
In this world there are all types
of girls. But there are many...

739
01:09:55,525 --> 01:10:00,167
...who don't see a husbands
hands and legs, but see their...

740
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:05,230
...heart and mind. I have seen
your soul. For god's sake...

741
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:16,920
...let me stay here.

742
01:10:27,157 --> 01:10:31,503
Govind, if she herself says
that you should hold her hand,...

743
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:34,201
...then why are you avoiding it!

744
01:10:34,264 --> 01:10:37,609
Mother, are you also
supporting her?

745
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:43,174
Think, if she was your daughter,
and I of some one else, would...

746
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,617
...you have given her hand
happily into mine?

747
01:10:48,144 --> 01:10:53,651
I had come as a servant to this
house. If you bless me, I will...

748
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:55,885
...become your daughter in law.

749
01:10:55,952 --> 01:11:02,062
We cannot be more fortunate,
that a girl as good and...

750
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:05,436
...beautiful becomes our
daughter-in-law.

751
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:10,638
We accept you. And I am
confident Govind will not ...

752
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:13,313
...disobey his parents.

753
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,971
The younger one gets married to
my sister. And the elder one...

754
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:38,937
...to a servant!

755
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,342
Congratulations. Here are
your marriage gifts to you.

756
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,036
What is this?

757
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,477
Dowry for my sister's marriage!

758
01:11:45,535 --> 01:11:48,209
My sister will sweep with this
broom and collect cowdung in...

759
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:50,308
this basket after marriage.
Brother!

760
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:53,877
What is this joke?
This is reality!

761
01:11:53,943 --> 01:11:56,617
Govind's marriage has been
finalised with Radha.

762
01:11:56,679 --> 01:12:00,388
Marriage! To a servant
of the house!

763
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:03,954
That is what I am crying for.
After marriage, Neelima's status..

764
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:05,590
...Will be equated
with a servant.

765
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,598
It looks you too have
got on to their side.

766
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:09,997
What nonsense?

767
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:13,506
What do you think? I will give
my sister's hand into a house

768
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:16,476
...where elder son's wife is
washing clothes at the well the...

769
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:20,345
...whole day! There is a limit to
being insulted, Lets go from here.

770
01:12:20,403 --> 01:12:23,475
Don't do anything in haste. Do
you think that I am happy at

771
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:25,951
...the news. My heart has broken
after hearing this.

772
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:29,251
This girl, who has no caste or
relatives. how can she be our...

773
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:30,484
...daughter in law?

774
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:33,288
Give up this crying. Who
listens to you in this house?

775
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:37,229
When she was a servant, she
beat me. And if she becomes...

776
01:12:37,287 --> 01:12:39,631
...the daughter in law, she
will beat me with shoes!

777
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,858
Auntie, I cannot sell my self
respect so that you prosper!

778
01:12:41,925 --> 01:12:45,600
How can one without any respect
sell his respect?

779
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:51,043
Here is the villain. First he
married you & left you childless.

780
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:56,516
After that he ensured that your
Sham also separates from you.

781
01:12:56,572 --> 01:13:00,452
Navrangi, If you utter a word
against my elder brother,

782
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,012
...I'll pull out your tongue.

783
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:04,115
Do you think that I will watch
quietly when you pull my tongue

784
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,423
My blood will cry out
the true facts then also.

785
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:12,865
Navrangi, forget about these
things. Think about the solution.

786
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:17,166
I have thought of it. Till you
divide the house into two,...

787
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:20,003
...parts, tell uncle you will
not stay here.

788
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:23,475
What did you say? How dare you
make such a statement! I won't ..

789
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:31,975
First you got after my family.
Now you dare raise your hand...

790
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:34,487
...on my family's only
surviving issue, my nephew!

791
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:37,354
There will be division of this
house. Surely it will be!

792
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,019
Please come to your senses!

793
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,221
Don't tell me anything!

794
01:13:41,284 --> 01:13:44,925
Auntie, ask for your half. If this
old man dies, they will make

795
01:13:44,988 --> 01:13:46,934
...you beg on the streets.

796
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:53,406
I know it Navrangi. I know
each utensil of this house..

797
01:13:53,463 --> 01:13:55,534
I will ensure now that
here is a division.

798
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:59,478
We separate. Even the
kitchen will be separated.

799
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:05,884
I will take into account each
cloth and each grain!

800
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:10,982
Till now I was in the dark.
You have opened my eyes today.

801
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:17,461
Hear me. If we don't have a
partition of this house,...

802
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,557
...I will hang myself and die

803
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:23,627
Should I get the rope. Once you
hang yourself, I will sort each...

804
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,271
...one of them afterwards

805
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:30,368
What are you looking at? I am
not threatening. I will do what...

806
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:32,174
...I have said.

807
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:37,309
Go hang yourself. But this house
is like a string of pearls. I'll

808
01:14:37,373 --> 01:14:40,013
...not allow any pearl
to be dispersed.

809
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:45,924
I will see how you don't do it
I'll ensure division of everything

810
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:49,987
Why are you talking like a child.
This house, this property, these...

811
01:14:50,053 --> 01:14:55,526
...lands are all yours. What ever
is here is my brother's hard ...

812
01:14:55,591 --> 01:15:00,540
...earnings. We are just
caretakers. Put everything in...

813
01:15:00,597 --> 01:15:05,068
...your name, but don't
talk of division.

814
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:09,082
Auntie, all this is just talk.
Don't get carried away.

815
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:14,918
Don't I know him? I am asking
for my right, not begging!

816
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:19,084
Your uncle desires that the entire
property goes to that lame duck.

817
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:22,823
Think, sister. Do you think we
begot children so that we

818
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:28,563
...become the masters! Sister,
make me do anything, but let...

819
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,104
...not two brothers separate.

820
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:38,044
I will not listen to anything. I
have decided. Now nobody can...

821
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:40,012
...make me change my mind.
Come Navrangi.

822
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:47,652
What did I think, and
what has happened?

823
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:57,525
Due to me, now this world
will be divided into two!

824
01:15:57,587 --> 01:16:03,538
I cannot see this. I thought by
finding a place here, I will take...

825
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:10,533
...care of this house. But by this
if there is a split, then give...

826
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,409
...me permission to go.

827
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:19,452
Do you feel by your going away
the house will not be split?

828
01:16:21,277 --> 01:16:26,090
I have been seeing it for several
days, that there has been some...

829
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:28,527
...smoke coming out
from somewhere.

830
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:32,999
And this smoke had to lead to
fire one day which happened now

831
01:16:33,222 --> 01:16:40,162
How long will you be quiet. I've
spoken to the Village Assembly.

832
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:45,542
They said if you go & say, they
they will divide the property.

833
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:51,984
I touch your feet, don't destroy
the family. The family has

834
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:57,041
...always remained united like
nest. Don't break it.

835
01:17:03,519 --> 01:17:08,161
Why are you tying Shankar in
this. If the split is agreeable...

836
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:10,261
...to him, why are you objecting.

837
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:16,834
I know him very well. He
considers you like his mother.

838
01:17:16,899 --> 01:17:21,109
You made a lot of hue & cry &
that poor chap must've agreed

839
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:26,620
Beside Shankar and his
children, whom have we got?.

840
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:28,220
Don't talk of a division.

841
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:34,318
Look, don't cry like a woman in
front of me. I've lived with you...

842
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:40,561
...for thirty years. Have you ever
agreed to any point of mine?

843
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:45,572
There will be division. Or else
I will set myself on fire!

844
01:17:45,628 --> 01:17:50,628
Do what you want then? Burn
the entire family to ashes. Go!!

845
01:17:57,974 --> 01:18:05,984
I know my Shankar will never
misunderstand me. He is my...

846
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:09,552
...brother. He is
like a son to me.

847
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:21,801
Hurry up. Now read out the
paper on the division.

848
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:28,311
In front of the Village Assembly,
the two brothers Jeewan Lal &...

849
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:32,410
...Shankar Lal's joint property is
being divided equally.

850
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:38,448
Collectively they have 100 acres.
This is being divided equally

851
01:18:38,514 --> 01:18:45,489
...between the brothers. Remaining
cows, horses, goats, vessels...

852
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:53,473
...are divided equally. The house
which is in the village is being...

853
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:57,341
...divided equally into
two by erecting a wall.

854
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:01,439
Thereafter they will not interfere
into each other's lives.

855
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:04,485
Is it agreeable to you both?

856
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,955
Head Man, Silence
means both agree!

857
01:19:29,799 --> 01:19:38,150
Shankar, I am elder to you.
Somehow I had maintained the...

858
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:48,185
...respect of this house till now.
Only the house members knew...

859
01:19:48,251 --> 01:19:56,966
...what was happening inside.
But today everyone knows how...

860
01:19:57,026 --> 01:20:02,026
...many utensils & clothes we've!
Shankar, the house may be split.

861
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:18,450
But there is no assembly which
can split the two of us.

862
01:20:18,514 --> 01:20:27,525
Whether you stay on this side or
that, we will continue to remain...

863
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:35,338
...brothers. No one can split
our love.

864
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:45,375
Whatever is happening is due to
compulsion. Don't mistake me

865
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,421
Forgive me!

866
01:20:53,315 --> 01:21:00,233
Can't it happen that my body is
divided into two. One stays in...

867
01:21:00,289 --> 01:21:04,431
...your part of the house,
and one in mine.

868
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:08,964
How can I stay alone?

869
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:13,207
How are you alone?

870
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:18,150
Nobody except death
can separate us.

871
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,118
Brother!

872
01:21:24,347 --> 01:21:27,556
Strange people. By crying you
have made garbage here.

873
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:32,361
You farmers smile. You will not
count the bread the other eats!

874
01:21:34,523 --> 01:21:36,867
We of the assembly have nothing
to do with your internal fights.

875
01:21:36,926 --> 01:21:41,306
We have divided the property
into two equal halves

876
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:45,971
You have done justice. but not
with my sister. She is a victim...

877
01:21:46,035 --> 01:21:47,878
...of injustice.
How is that?

878
01:21:47,937 --> 01:21:50,281
Sham is getting married
to Neelima, my sister.

879
01:21:50,339 --> 01:21:53,650
From Shankar's share half is
Govind's and half is Sham's.

880
01:21:53,876 --> 01:21:56,379
Why shouldn the division amongst
brothers not be done now,

881
01:21:56,445 --> 01:21:58,254
...or else the assembly will have
to take the trouble once again.

882
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:02,125
Who are you to ask for
the brothers division?

883
01:22:02,184 --> 01:22:07,258
Our fathers hand is on our head!
- It will not remain so forever

884
01:22:07,323 --> 01:22:09,860
Today your father is separating
from his brother.

885
01:22:12,128 --> 01:22:16,167
And if you think I am wrong,
go and ask your brother.

886
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:23,282
Shamu, come here. Does he think
Shamu and Govind are two

887
01:22:23,339 --> 01:22:26,912
...separate persons!
Shut this person's mouth!

888
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:30,446
Shamu, say it!

889
01:22:30,513 --> 01:22:36,054
I've nothing to say. Whatever he
says is agreeable to me

890
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,928
Shamu, is that you speaking?

891
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:49,133
Why didn't I die before this.
When Govind's leg and hand...

892
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:56,673
...were damaged, I cried and
prayed. When you were born...

893
01:22:56,905 --> 01:23:04,847
...my tears stopped. I thought
that to help Govind, God gave...

894
01:23:04,914 --> 01:23:11,559
...you to me. I thought you will
help your brother at each step.

895
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:16,262
But now listening to him, you
have forgotten your family.

896
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:20,967
Tell me, will you ask for your
share and leave him without...

897
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:27,470
...support?
Yes, I will. I will.

898
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:34,654
Take my heart and auction
it in the market!

899
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:36,379
Mother!

900
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:40,985
Leave him. When our own blood
has rebelled, why make a scene.

901
01:23:43,085 --> 01:23:47,898
Make their division also. Sham
you also listen. From today,

902
01:23:47,957 --> 01:23:54,397
...we are not yours, and you are
not ours. And write this also in..

903
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:56,443
...This paper, that on my death,
he will not even touch my dead...

904
01:23:56,498 --> 01:24:02,540
...bodyl He will not light my pyre.
He is not my son!

905
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:19,850
Whenever I remember the good
times, I will remember that

906
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:32,129
...somewhere I too had a abode
where I could rest!

907
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:43,240
Yesterday there was a paradise,
but today it is hell.

908
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:05,470
What has happened in front of
our eyes gradually

909
01:25:22,985 --> 01:25:27,985
I have no sorrow
about this destruction.

910
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:42,204
Regrets are on why there was a
debate on this destruction.

911
01:26:13,068 --> 01:26:19,417
I had a small abode...

912
01:26:26,248 --> 01:26:32,130
Today each shred has
separated from the other.

913
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:05,883
Looking at my house, I think
I have seen it before!

914
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:57,010
Those who were observing,
saw only the smoke.

915
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:09,487
Who has seen my
heart burning?

916
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:35,486
Play it loudly.
I will fill your pockets!

917
01:28:35,544 --> 01:28:39,686
How is Shankar now? Is he
getting better with medicines?

918
01:28:39,748 --> 01:28:41,989
I am putting in
my best efforts.

919
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:46,123
For two days his eyes were
closed. Now he talks. His heart...

920
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:48,896
...is broken. He keeps
crying the whole time.

921
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:53,929
This crying is for a life time.
Whatever expenditure is there, ..

922
01:28:53,996 --> 01:28:56,567
...Take it from me, don't
take from Shankar.

923
01:28:56,632 --> 01:29:02,105
Agreed everything is divided. But
can't one brother see another?

924
01:29:05,874 --> 01:29:09,686
My wife says, if you visit
Shankar it will be over her...

925
01:29:09,745 --> 01:29:15,889
...dead body. She doesn't realise
that I am a living dead person.

926
01:29:22,157 --> 01:29:24,228
Where is this Shahnai
being played?

927
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:27,565
Today is our Sham's wedding.

928
01:29:29,498 --> 01:29:34,498
Sham's wedding! Lots of big
people must have come..

929
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:48,817
It is taking place without
parents, without elder brother.

930
01:29:53,021 --> 01:30:01,600
How unlucky am I, that I can't
bless my son, in his marriage.

931
01:30:03,932 --> 01:30:08,932
Parents' blessings are
always with the children!

932
01:30:32,694 --> 01:30:37,109
How has this creature come in.
Navrangi, where are you?

933
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:42,012
Shamu, congratulations! Father is
very sick. He wants to see you.

934
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:47,383
Mother wishes to see you
dressed up like a groom.

935
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,149
Come with me for two minutes.

936
01:30:49,378 --> 01:30:52,916
I remember very well what
father had said. That he doesn't..

937
01:30:52,981 --> 01:30:56,929
...Want to see me, and on death
I should not touch his dead body

938
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:01,730
You remember all this, but father
has forgotten everything.

939
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:07,971
When we were kids, didn't he
beat us? Did we ever go into a...

940
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:13,536
...sulk. After growing up, does it
mean we now get annoyed on

941
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:18,813
...small things? When a hen
hides her brood under her...

942
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:24,551
...the chicks never feel
she will strangle them.

943
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:31,796
Neelima, I am elder to you, and
in relations too I am a senior.

944
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:35,824
You are now the daughter in law
of this house. Pardon me if I

945
01:31:35,891 --> 01:31:40,806
...have annoyed you in any way.
Just once take Shamu and do

946
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:44,867
...a round that side. Father
will be very happy.

947
01:31:44,933 --> 01:31:49,006
Father doesn't like her one bit.
Will he get happy seeing her...

948
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:50,481
...as a bride, today?

949
01:31:50,539 --> 01:31:57,957
Shamu, forget the past. Our
relation is that of blood.

950
01:31:58,013 --> 01:32:04,055
Come Shamu, your father is
calling you. He considers you...

951
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:05,792
...as his support for old age.

952
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:10,428
Govind, you are wasting our
time. Come with me, Neelima.

953
01:32:11,993 --> 01:32:15,873
Shamu, do you realise what you
are doing. You have just wedded..

954
01:32:15,931 --> 01:32:19,970
...A stranger and think the world
of her. But behind this wall is...

955
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:22,948
...another woman, who brought
you into light from darkness!

956
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:29,080
But this woman is sitting with a
sick man, praying that her

957
01:32:29,144 --> 01:32:35,891
...husband does not die, that she
does not become a widow. Come!

958
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:43,363
Take him out! Push him outside!

959
01:32:43,425 --> 01:32:47,100
Navrangi, don't you dare touch
my son! I will cut you into

960
01:32:47,162 --> 01:32:50,803
...pieces and feed the dogs!
Come forward, anyone!

961
01:32:50,866 --> 01:32:52,675
I will come in front.
You dare come!

962
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:57,649
Uncle! Today is Shamu's wedding
Don't do such a thing

963
01:32:57,873 --> 01:33:00,877
Do you call this a marriage?
This is a death ceremony

964
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,786
Leave them. I pray to
you. Leave them.

965
01:33:05,147 --> 01:33:08,788
Ok, son. Now go to your house.
Let these dogs bark.

966
01:33:10,185 --> 01:33:12,165
Brother!

967
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:20,972
Don't do such a thing.

968
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:32,485
My sickness has been cured by
my brother. And the worry of...

969
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:37,923
...Govind's marriage has been
cleared by you. Parents are...

970
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:42,860
...worried for a daughters
marriage. And we were worried...

971
01:33:42,918 --> 01:33:46,832
...for our son's marriage. God
did a cruel act by snatching...

972
01:33:46,888 --> 01:33:53,863
...away your parents. For you
God is heartless. But for us...

973
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:59,002
...he has been kind that he has
sent you after you were orphaned

974
01:34:01,169 --> 01:34:04,150
You held the hand of my son,
who was unfit to hold an ...

975
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:05,851
...one's hand.

976
01:34:07,175 --> 01:34:09,018
Rest now, father. I will get
your medicine.

977
01:34:10,779 --> 01:34:14,420
Now I will look forward to
living to see my grandchildren ...

978
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:16,484
...play in my lap.

979
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:42,354
Lord, when Lakshman fell sick,
you brought the rare Sanjeevani...

980
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:48,383
...to cure him. I too am your
devotee. Call me to you, but...

981
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:55,368
...let not anything happen to
Shankar. I am a sinner. But

982
01:34:55,423 --> 01:35:03,569
...hear me. For sake of Parvati,
Radha and Govind, extend the

983
01:35:03,632 --> 01:35:06,704
...life of my brother, Shankar.

984
01:35:08,136 --> 01:35:11,515
Brother!
Shankar!

985
01:35:16,645 --> 01:35:19,057
Why did you come out so soon?
You should have rest

986
01:35:19,113 --> 01:35:20,421
...for a few more days.

987
01:35:20,482 --> 01:35:23,827
With your blessings I am all
right. I came to you for taking...

988
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:25,728
...permission for an
important issue.

989
01:35:25,787 --> 01:35:28,461
Sit down. What is it?

990
01:35:30,825 --> 01:35:33,635
I thought I should now get
Radha and Govind married.

991
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:36,539
Why not? This happy event
should be held as early as...

992
01:35:36,598 --> 01:35:43,516
...possible. Don't worry about
anything. I have set aside money..

993
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:47,075
...For Govinds marriage. Spend as
much as you want. Hold it with...

994
01:35:47,142 --> 01:35:54,959
...great show. He is our first
son. Ther aree many auspicious...

995
01:35:55,016 --> 01:35:57,622
...days next week. Get them
married on any one day.

996
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:05,170
Listen, you are going alone.
Shankar, for days we have'nt...

997
01:36:05,393 --> 01:36:08,499
...walked together. Let us walk
up to the house together. Come.

998
01:36:10,398 --> 01:36:16,974
A registered letter?
What is it, brother-in-law

999
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:22,887
First they used to come to me,
now you are getting them.

1000
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:26,050
Have a close look. I hope it
is not a registered notice.

1001
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:28,458
Brother, do talk good
things for a change!

1002
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:31,622
I had applied for a managerial
post in the city, in a factory.

1003
01:36:31,686 --> 01:36:35,133
Its reply has come. I have got
the post. within a week...

1004
01:36:35,356 --> 01:36:36,562
...I have to join.

1005
01:36:39,761 --> 01:36:43,038
See, how fortunate is Neelima's
coming home. Ok, now lets us...

1006
01:36:43,097 --> 01:36:44,576
...have sweets.

1007
01:36:46,635 --> 01:36:49,081
Mother!
What is it?

1008
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:52,016
Radha now-a-days doesn't bathe
me. I asked her to pour water,...

1009
01:36:52,073 --> 01:36:53,848
and she ran away!

1010
01:36:53,909 --> 01:36:57,447
Now, she will do all this service
only after marriage. Oh, mom.

1011
01:36:57,512 --> 01:37:00,823
I talk of a bathe,
and you talk of marriage.

1012
01:37:02,483 --> 01:37:03,860
Govind's mother!

1013
01:37:03,918 --> 01:37:07,127
Brother has given permission.
And I have taken out a date.

1014
01:37:07,355 --> 01:37:11,462
Date for what, father? Are you
going to break down the wall?

1015
01:37:11,526 --> 01:37:16,100
Yes, but the wall
between you and Radha.

1016
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:20,510
Your marriage date is fixed
for day after. Come, now...

1017
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:22,570
...there is very little time,
and lots of work.

1018
01:37:22,637 --> 01:37:25,641
I will go to give the invitation to
Shamu for the marriage. Why?

1019
01:37:25,707 --> 01:37:29,416
Did he call you for his
marriage? You were going to...

1020
01:37:29,477 --> 01:37:30,785
...get beaten up instead

1021
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:34,088
Look, Shamu is younger. If he
acts foolishly, should I do the...

1022
01:37:34,315 --> 01:37:38,491
...same? I will definitely go!

1023
01:37:38,553 --> 01:37:43,332
Listen, don't go there?
Why not? You too had gone...

1024
01:37:43,391 --> 01:37:45,735
...to your brother to
seek his permission.

1025
01:37:47,328 --> 01:37:53,438
You will be insulted there. It
does not matter. But I will go.

1026
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:07,724
Come, Mr Lame duck. You have'nt
left us here also, to make our...

1027
01:38:07,782 --> 01:38:09,728
...heaven into hell!

1028
01:38:09,784 --> 01:38:12,993
Navrangi, don't say anything now.
Has a mad dog bitten me?

1029
01:38:13,054 --> 01:38:17,525
I have been searching for you.
Listen to me. Come this side.

1030
01:38:20,028 --> 01:38:25,376
What is it?
Say some thing!

1031
01:38:25,433 --> 01:38:30,007
I am getting married!
- Marriage? With whom?

1032
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:31,072
With Radha.

1033
01:38:34,476 --> 01:38:37,150
It is true. Myself and Radha
are getting married.

1034
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:40,382
Bring Neelima and do
come for the marriage.

1035
01:38:40,448 --> 01:38:44,624
Did you hear? He is
calling me also.

1036
01:38:45,019 --> 01:38:49,126
Yes, first you. Earlier there was
discord. Perhaps my marriage...

1037
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:52,763
...will mend broken relationships.
I have come with great hopes!

1038
01:38:52,827 --> 01:38:55,774
What are we coming down to.
We have to attend a servant's...

1039
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:58,709
...marriage. isn't Radha the same
girl who raised her hand...

1040
01:38:58,766 --> 01:38:59,972
...on my brother.

1041
01:39:00,034 --> 01:39:03,038
If she had raised her hand, I
would have held it. But she...

1042
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:04,515
...raised a broom!

1043
01:39:04,572 --> 01:39:07,416
Haven't you insulted my brother
enough, that you wish to again...

1044
01:39:07,475 --> 01:39:12,618
...insult us. You are expert in
adding to the fire!

1045
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:15,957
Neelima, you keep quiet.
Brother, it is better you go.

1046
01:39:16,017 --> 01:39:21,194
Listen, give military orders to
him. Just get out from here.

1047
01:39:21,422 --> 01:39:25,427
I have enemity with
whatever is old.

1048
01:39:25,493 --> 01:39:28,770
Navrangi, I understand what is
old fashioned and what is new.

1049
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:33,540
If one says yes to bad things,
then one is new and educated.

1050
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:37,139
One who respects his parents,
is considered old fashioned.

1051
01:39:37,372 --> 01:39:39,750
One who forgets his parents,
does not visit them and...

1052
01:39:39,808 --> 01:39:44,621
...forgets them after marriage,
and never come to even meet

1053
01:39:44,679 --> 01:39:46,556
...them, he is new and intelligent!

1054
01:39:46,614 --> 01:39:50,585
Don't argue about the new and
old here. Why are you jealous...

1055
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:54,531
...if he has got a new world
beautiful wife? To you the ...

1056
01:39:54,589 --> 01:39:58,036
...servant be welcome. Wife and
a servant too. Get children

1057
01:39:58,092 --> 01:40:00,868
...produced by her, or get the
house swept from her.

1058
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:06,002
Why should I be jealous. I feel
pity for my brother. We follow..

1059
01:40:06,067 --> 01:40:08,673
...The Ramayana. We know how
to die for our brothers!

1060
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:14,015
Which holy books have you read.
In our books, it is written Bali...

1061
01:40:14,075 --> 01:40:18,046
...was killed by his true brother,
Sagreev. And Ravan by Vibhishan.

1062
01:40:18,112 --> 01:40:23,425
Keep your books to yourself.
We are all educated. You cannot..

1063
01:40:23,485 --> 01:40:25,192
...Fool us with this talk.

1064
01:40:26,587 --> 01:40:30,729
Shamu, you might be quite
educated. But the books don't

1065
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:36,070
...teach whom to associate with.
If you were so wise, you would...

1066
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,041
...not have got fooled my the
shine of brass, and...

1067
01:40:38,099 --> 01:40:39,373
...mistake it for gold.

1068
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:41,743
I think he has come to know
that Shamu has got a job.

1069
01:40:41,803 --> 01:40:44,647
That is how he has come
wagging his tail for his brother.

1070
01:40:44,706 --> 01:40:46,583
He is trying to make
some bread for himself.

1071
01:40:46,641 --> 01:40:48,712
I spit on such bread which is
earned by some one else.

1072
01:40:48,776 --> 01:40:52,121
Do you think I will break bread
of a person who has forgotten...

1073
01:40:52,179 --> 01:40:56,594
...his parents? Even a dog will
not eat bread of such a person.

1074
01:40:56,651 --> 01:40:58,187
Why eat, he will not
even sniff at it?

1075
01:40:58,419 --> 01:41:01,730
Have you heard. He is calling you
a dog! And you are not even

1076
01:41:01,789 --> 01:41:04,463
...biting, or even barking!

1077
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:08,473
Govind, I am fed up listening to
your nonsense. Get out from here

1078
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:12,944
Shamu, this Navrang has many
colours like a chameleon.

1079
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:14,537
He keep changing them.
You better be careful of him.

1080
01:41:14,602 --> 01:41:18,448
It is the limit. He keeps talking
nonsense, and you keep listening!

1081
01:41:18,506 --> 01:41:21,715
Neelima, till today I kept quiet
for you are my brother's wife.

1082
01:41:21,776 --> 01:41:24,552
Other wise what would you have
done? Speak! Navrangi!

1083
01:41:46,668 --> 01:41:48,807
Shamu, you have done
a good thing.

1084
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:51,578
Slowly, I am recognising
you too.

1085
01:41:54,042 --> 01:42:02,427
Lord, for me it is all right, but
don't show such days to Sham.

1086
01:43:40,348 --> 01:43:42,021
What has happened to you?

1087
01:43:42,083 --> 01:43:44,529
Why are you standing so sad?

1088
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:50,164
Radha, my heart says I have
done injustice to you.

1089
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:54,100
Is favor ever injustice?

1090
01:43:54,161 --> 01:43:58,541
What favor? I am unfit for you.

1091
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:03,741
You don't know
what you are to me.

1092
01:44:03,805 --> 01:44:04,977
Everything!

1093
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:29,770
You are my temple.
You are my prayer.

1094
01:44:29,831 --> 01:44:36,680
And You are my God!

1095
01:44:52,887 --> 01:45:00,567
If someone see with my eyes,
they will understand...

1096
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:05,839
...what you are to me.

1097
01:45:36,731 --> 01:45:42,909
Wherever I see,
I see only you.

1098
01:45:43,971 --> 01:45:50,581
Then what thoughts
are you lost in?

1099
01:46:10,898 --> 01:46:17,747
Just smile when you look
at me...

1100
01:46:17,805 --> 01:46:25,587
...or else I will think,
you are annoyed with me.

1101
01:46:54,141 --> 01:47:01,389
You are the sparkle of the
vermillion on my forehead.

1102
01:47:01,449 --> 01:47:08,731
You are only my destination
of the flowers in my hand

1103
01:47:27,741 --> 01:47:32,741
I am a small earthen doll,
you are the life, you are the sky.

1104
01:48:20,627 --> 01:48:27,101
Now it is quite late night,
let me put you to sleep.

1105
01:48:27,168 --> 01:48:33,449
Let the breeze give the music,
I will sing you a Iullaby.

1106
01:49:04,772 --> 01:49:09,772
Looking at you I feel
as if an angel is sleeping.

1107
01:49:48,449 --> 01:49:52,727
Sham, this is you office.
Mr. Roshan LalGood Morning

1108
01:49:53,854 --> 01:49:55,595
He is our chief accountant.

1109
01:49:55,656 --> 01:49:57,761
And he is our new
manager, Mr Sham.

1110
01:50:00,127 --> 01:50:02,073
If there is something he doesn't
understand, just help him.

1111
01:50:04,498 --> 01:50:05,670
Whose letter is this?

1112
01:50:05,733 --> 01:50:10,011
It is his. He said as soon as he
gets a house on hire, he will

1113
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:11,413
...immediately call me.

1114
01:50:11,472 --> 01:50:15,579
He must be sad. He
loves you immensely.

1115
01:50:19,714 --> 01:50:24,220
Auntie, Neelima's worry is over.
Sham has a job in the city.

1116
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:28,593
I am worrying, where
will you eat from?

1117
01:50:28,656 --> 01:50:33,969
What shortage do I have. I have
a house, lands. What more ?

1118
01:50:34,028 --> 01:50:39,102
Auntie, Govt is passing a law
that a man cannot keep more...

1119
01:50:39,166 --> 01:50:46,948
...than 1 acre of land. My god,
what has happened to the Govt!

1120
01:50:47,008 --> 01:50:50,649
Is there a solution for this?

1121
01:50:50,711 --> 01:50:53,453
Why not start
some business?

1122
01:50:55,983 --> 01:50:59,931
We are landlords. Besides
farming we have done nothing.

1123
01:51:01,688 --> 01:51:06,603
Your innocence is heartwarming.
What is left in land. Just soil !

1124
01:51:06,661 --> 01:51:08,902
Nowadays there are such
business that in two days,...

1125
01:51:08,962 --> 01:51:11,806
...you put in one,
and you get 10 in return.

1126
01:51:11,865 --> 01:51:15,836
What? What business
is that?

1127
01:51:15,903 --> 01:51:21,512
There are numerous. But the best
is of carnival. what is that?

1128
01:51:21,575 --> 01:51:25,580
Show business. When a man
returns home, he brings 10000/-.

1129
01:51:25,646 --> 01:51:30,857
No credit, all cash. Only
Rs 50000 is required.

1130
01:51:30,918 --> 01:51:35,526
By year end you will be decked
in gold from head to foot.

1131
01:51:35,589 --> 01:51:39,401
You will be putting on a
Cashmere Shawl and relaxing!

1132
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:42,737
For Uncle also, no simple hair,
but modern cut!

1133
01:51:42,796 --> 01:51:46,175
But where will we get
Rs. 50000 from?

1134
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:49,108
Auntie, what is this land
and house for?

1135
01:51:49,169 --> 01:51:52,173
We will morgage them and take
the money. When the money

1136
01:51:52,406 --> 01:51:54,579
...starts rolling in, we will return
the debt and free the house.

1137
01:51:54,641 --> 01:51:56,484
Just convince Uncle!

1138
01:51:56,544 --> 01:52:01,015
Navrangi, you used to do the
same thing in Singapore. isn't it?

1139
01:52:01,081 --> 01:52:04,494
I made millions and spent
millions. If the govt hadn't...

1140
01:52:04,551 --> 01:52:07,589
...changed, would I have come
here? I have 8 bungalows

1141
01:52:07,655 --> 01:52:10,602
...9 cars, two aerodromes and 3
railway stations there!

1142
01:52:10,658 --> 01:52:14,834
3 railway stations! Yes, I used
to be so busy, sometimes I

1143
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:16,841
...slept on the platform, and
sometimes at the airport.

1144
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:20,674
And all due to the Carnival.
See, I will get the govt papers...

1145
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:25,114
...somehow. Get uncle's
signatures on it, and then you...

1146
01:52:25,172 --> 01:52:26,810
...will be rolling in wealth.

1147
01:52:26,874 --> 01:52:32,415
Getting his signature is my job,
how dare he not sign.

1148
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:35,461
Why not Auntie? You are my
father's sister. And my father...

1149
01:52:35,516 --> 01:52:37,996
...used to kill tigers
by merely winking!

1150
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:45,160
What sad meditation are you in?
Just sign here.

1151
01:52:45,392 --> 01:52:50,171
Land is considered our mother,
and the house is our ancestors...

1152
01:52:50,397 --> 01:52:53,401
...memory. Doing all this
is a great sin!

1153
01:52:53,467 --> 01:52:57,643
You will remain a frog in a well.
Navrangi will make five million

1154
01:52:57,705 --> 01:52:59,776
...from your Rs. 50000/-.

1155
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:06,052
And thereafter our grandchildren
will enjoy! Who is there to eat ..

1156
01:53:06,113 --> 01:53:07,387
...Of this 5 million?

1157
01:53:07,448 --> 01:53:10,622
I will eat. I will do charity.
I will make a temple.

1158
01:53:10,684 --> 01:53:15,190
When you make a temple, as a
statue put Navrangi there.

1159
01:53:15,422 --> 01:53:19,131
What is a bigger temple than a
house that you want to mortgage

1160
01:53:19,192 --> 01:53:23,971
...it and make another.
- Don't talk of Navrangi. Poor...

1161
01:53:24,031 --> 01:53:27,706
...chap is always worried about
you. He keeps asking, ' has...

1162
01:53:27,768 --> 01:53:29,873
...uncle eaten? Has he rested?'

1163
01:53:29,937 --> 01:53:33,077
Ok, I will sign, but on one
condition. What is that?

1164
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:38,852
Just that from today he
will not call me uncle.

1165
01:53:45,019 --> 01:53:46,623
This is a full R$.5000O/-.

1166
01:53:46,687 --> 01:53:54,162
Auntie, my head and your
blessings means...

1167
01:53:54,395 --> 01:53:58,537
that this amount multiplies
10 to 20 times & returns to you.

1168
01:53:58,599 --> 01:54:04,641
Money will beget money.
What do you say?it's good.

1169
01:54:06,807 --> 01:54:10,949
When she moans
I get scared.

1170
01:54:11,011 --> 01:54:17,519
Children give such trouble. But
when you have a child in your ...

1171
01:54:17,585 --> 01:54:19,826
...yard, you will be
filled with happiness.

1172
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:29,333
What is this? Will you be
able to eat such a big raw ...

1173
01:54:29,396 --> 01:54:34,675
...mango? You will get a sore
throat. Mom, I was just...

1174
01:54:34,734 --> 01:54:35,974
...feeling a bit weak.

1175
01:54:36,036 --> 01:54:40,542
What? Were you feeling
a bit nauseated also!

1176
01:54:40,608 --> 01:54:43,851
Yes, mother. Since morning.

1177
01:54:49,816 --> 01:54:52,160
Please listen.
What is it?

1178
01:54:52,386 --> 01:54:55,697
Govind, you go from here.
Say in front of him.

1179
01:54:55,756 --> 01:54:59,169
This is not for his ears.
Govind go from here.

1180
01:55:01,361 --> 01:55:03,898
Radha and Neelima ...
Have they fought?

1181
01:55:03,964 --> 01:55:06,137
No, no! Just listen!

1182
01:55:08,736 --> 01:55:09,942
To both!

1183
01:55:11,471 --> 01:55:13,007
Father, you look very happy.
What is the matter?

1184
01:55:13,073 --> 01:55:17,044
Mother, tell me. Am
I not your son?

1185
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:22,856
Son, you are getting a son!
You are going to be a father.

1186
01:55:24,118 --> 01:55:26,496
Father! My God!

1187
01:55:39,699 --> 01:55:41,736
Should I say a thing?
Don't tell anybody.

1188
01:55:41,801 --> 01:55:45,772
What is that? I am
going to be a father!

1189
01:55:48,041 --> 01:55:50,521
What are you looking
at me like that for?

1190
01:55:50,577 --> 01:55:55,583
You too are going to be mother.
Mother has just told me.

1191
01:55:57,484 --> 01:56:00,897
Leave me! I want a son,
a big fat healthy one!

1192
01:56:02,722 --> 01:56:07,933
Its come! Into your city has come
Bhagwanti Carnival. Famous

1193
01:56:07,995 --> 01:56:12,501
...expert from Singapore, Navrangi

01:56:12,566 --> 01:56:16,480
...will be announced shortly.

1195
01:56:31,485 --> 01:56:34,364
Is that Navrangilal?
This is Sham here.

1196
01:56:34,421 --> 01:56:38,665
Pardon me, since we have just
started, I am not getting a

1197
01:56:38,725 --> 01:56:42,366
...minute to spare. Do one
thing. Just come over here!

1198
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:47,141
You may have a problem finding
this place. I'll come to Ur office

1199
01:56:50,938 --> 01:56:54,147
Boss, these are two girls.
That I can see.

1200
01:56:54,374 --> 01:56:57,685
They have worked in Carnivals.
They dance very well.

1201
01:56:57,745 --> 01:57:01,454
What are your names.
Jati and Sati.

1202
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:05,622
Which Carnival had you worked
in earlier. Mot Mahal Carnival

1203
01:57:05,686 --> 01:57:10,897
Where are your parents?
ow you are their parents.

1204
01:57:10,958 --> 01:57:13,131
Boss, they are both orphans.

1205
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:17,069
This has become the fashion
nowadays, in theatre, shows,...

1206
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:21,044
..or Carinival. They first declare
themselves as orphans. Or they...

1207
01:57:21,101 --> 01:57:26,847
...get fake parents. Where do you
staySir, at Pawanpul.

1208
01:57:26,907 --> 01:57:30,753
They stay in quarters there.
How much salary?

1209
01:57:30,811 --> 01:57:34,657
This I have decided. The month
there is work, they will get...

1210
01:57:34,715 --> 01:57:37,525
Rs 300. That means for both
Rs600. And when we move...

1211
01:57:37,584 --> 01:57:43,694
...they will get good food,
and Rs.1 as allowance.

1212
01:57:47,094 --> 01:57:49,040
Manmouji, what is your
commission is this?

1213
01:57:49,095 --> 01:57:51,575
No commission.
Sir, both are orphans!

1214
01:57:53,667 --> 01:57:56,978
Ok, duty is very strict.
Put your heart and soul in it.

1215
01:57:57,037 --> 01:58:02,988
Nlangoesl Go and shout
elsewhere. Our garden is filled...

1216
01:58:03,043 --> 01:58:04,613
...with mangoes.

1217
01:58:04,678 --> 01:58:08,057
Mango women! Please
come here.

1218
01:58:11,918 --> 01:58:13,727
How are you selling them?
1 for 3 annas.

1219
01:58:13,787 --> 01:58:17,564
Are these mangoes or gold.
Radha, don't buy.

1220
01:58:17,624 --> 01:58:22,801
Govind, let her buy. Nowadays
whatever Radha wants, let her..

1221
01:58:22,862 --> 01:58:27,004
...Buy. If not when your son is
born, he will have pus in...

1222
01:58:27,067 --> 01:58:30,947
...his ears! No, mom!
Radha, buy it!

1223
01:58:31,004 --> 01:58:35,544
Give for 2 annas. No, sister.
We don't buy it at that rate.

1224
01:58:35,608 --> 01:58:38,555
I will give 3 annas!
- I will give 3 and a quarter.

1225
01:58:38,611 --> 01:58:40,921
3.5! 4! 5 annas.
6 annas.

1226
01:58:40,981 --> 01:58:44,929
Give the basket for Rs.10/-
Just trying to show off!

1227
01:58:44,985 --> 01:58:51,129
Do behave like a human at times.
To put smoke in others houses...

1228
01:58:51,191 --> 01:58:54,434
...you put fire to your own.
Nlangoes worth Rs.2 you bought...

1229
01:58:54,494 --> 01:58:59,568
...for 10. Shouldn't you have
realised that she is pregnant?

1230
01:58:59,633 --> 01:59:04,548
As if she will give birth to a
great warrior. In a handicapped...

1231
01:59:04,605 --> 01:59:06,710
...person's house, only a
lame child will be born.

1232
01:59:06,773 --> 01:59:10,983
If God had given the right to
produce children, you would...

1233
01:59:11,044 --> 01:59:14,548
...have produced many rascals.
He might give a rich child to a

1234
01:59:14,614 --> 01:59:19,563
...poor and a strong one at a
lame's house. Your yard is dirty!

1235
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:22,532
Your soul is also dirty, but at
least clean up the house!

1236
01:59:22,589 --> 01:59:26,594
Why should I clean now. First I
will eat mangoes, throw the...

1237
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:29,038
...seeds there and then I will
clean the yard! Understood?

1238
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:30,597
Yes, I have understood!

1239
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:44,587
Take! Don't mind her words! In
your house, strong, healthy and ...

1240
01:59:44,645 --> 01:59:47,592
...and a beautiful child will be
born. Go, daughter!

1241
01:59:52,686 --> 01:59:57,863
As if she will give birth to a
warrior! A lame only will be...

1242
01:59:57,925 --> 01:59:59,905
...born to a lame duck.

1243
02:02:08,021 --> 02:02:11,525
Money begets money,
with long hands!

1244
02:02:15,062 --> 02:02:17,064
Govind has come!

1245
02:02:18,932 --> 02:02:20,673
Govind, open your mouth!
What happened?

1246
02:02:20,733 --> 02:02:23,646
First eat, then I will tell.
Yes!

1247
02:02:23,703 --> 02:02:25,512
A son has been born.

1248
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:40,522
What will happen in my house?
In the enemies house there is...

1249
02:02:40,587 --> 02:02:41,588
...happiness. Sweets are
being distributed

1250
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:14,057
You!

1251
02:03:16,556 --> 02:03:18,058
What are you seeing?

1252
02:03:18,124 --> 02:03:23,699
Everything is all right. The
world and Auntie uses to say...

1253
02:03:23,763 --> 02:03:28,542
...the child will be like me. As if
the world & Aunt make children.

1254
02:03:28,601 --> 02:03:34,574
I used to think, if my son was
like me, who would look after...

1255
02:03:34,641 --> 02:03:38,020
...you after me. Now
your keeper has come!

1256
02:03:40,046 --> 02:03:42,083
Govind, why are you
troubling ihmi

1257
02:03:43,383 --> 02:03:46,762
Mom, do you see how innocent
he looks. Tau will be so happy...

1258
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:50,734
...seeing him.
Ok, let Radha rest now!

1259
02:03:50,790 --> 02:03:53,066
Go, now go!

1260
02:03:56,730 --> 02:04:00,473
Mother, he hasn't eaten since
morning. He must be hungry.

1261
02:04:00,534 --> 02:04:04,983
You look after your son's hunger.
I will look after mine.

1262
02:04:15,982 --> 02:04:18,690
God, what should I do?

1263
02:04:23,523 --> 02:04:29,701
Some body go and get the
doctor! Else neither will the...

1264
02:04:29,762 --> 02:04:31,605
...child live nor Neelimal

1265
02:04:36,636 --> 02:04:37,808
What happened, Govind?

1266
02:04:37,870 --> 02:04:41,545
I will just go to the
Doctor & get him here!

1267
02:04:50,417 --> 02:04:56,368
You have shown mercy here,
please show mercy there too.

1268
02:04:56,423 --> 02:04:59,961
Nothing should happen to my
daughter in law. Let there be...

1269
02:05:00,026 --> 02:05:01,937
...happiness there too.

1270
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:06,477
Hurry up, Doctor.

1271
02:05:14,908 --> 02:05:17,047
Mother, I have got the doctor!

1272
02:05:42,835 --> 02:05:46,078
Sister, A son has been born
or a girl. A son is born.

1273
02:05:46,139 --> 02:05:50,053
How is the mother?
- With great difficulty, she...

1274
02:05:50,109 --> 02:05:53,682
...was saved. But one arm
of the child is twisted.

1275
02:05:53,747 --> 02:05:59,060
Is your heart satisfied now?
Every day this lame duck used ...

1276
02:05:59,118 --> 02:06:02,565
...to keep peeping into this side.
His shadow has fallen this side.

1277
02:06:02,622 --> 02:06:06,570
Don't talk like that. All this is
destiny. Destiny be dammed!

1278
02:06:06,626 --> 02:06:10,597
I made the wall, but I
couldn't stop their evil eye!

1279
02:06:10,663 --> 02:06:17,512
What will my Sham think. First
child and that too twisted!

1280
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:21,882
He is a child. His hand
can be straightened !

1281
02:06:21,942 --> 02:06:25,583
Speak softly. It shouldn't happen
that he straightens his own.

1282
02:06:44,330 --> 02:06:47,368
After showing false love for
two days, a man went away.

1283
02:06:47,433 --> 02:06:51,006
Can any one tell me, how should
I keep my heart under control?

1284
02:06:51,070 --> 02:06:57,487
My youth has gone to dust!

1285
02:06:57,543 --> 02:07:04,119
Nobody understands
my story, Oh lord!

1286
02:07:28,041 --> 02:07:31,318
He used to offer a Benares
sweet betel leaf with love

1287
02:07:31,377 --> 02:07:34,358
Frequently he used to say,
Oh, my sweet heart!

1288
02:07:41,521 --> 02:07:44,127
When I remember
his sweet tongue,

1289
02:07:48,995 --> 02:07:53,967
Crying copiously my
innocent heart says...

1290
02:07:54,033 --> 02:07:55,103
What?

1291
02:07:55,335 --> 02:07:58,475
My youth has gone
to dust, Oh Lord.

1292
02:08:35,108 --> 02:08:37,987
Now it is just a question
of only two days...

1293
02:08:38,044 --> 02:08:41,150
...but without my lover it is
impossible to spend the night.

1294
02:08:48,054 --> 02:08:51,001
I thought this companionship
was for life...

1295
02:08:55,628 --> 02:09:01,476
How did I know all
men are like that!

1296
02:09:51,817 --> 02:09:56,095
If these 4 eyes had not met...

1297
02:09:56,155 --> 02:09:57,930
Parting wouldn't have
been so painful.

1298
02:10:04,497 --> 02:10:10,812
See how expensive has been
this game of love!

1299
02:10:10,870 --> 02:10:17,515
This is said by none else than
the flowing oil of my tresses!

1300
02:10:41,467 --> 02:10:44,971
My fatherland's currency!

1301
02:10:50,543 --> 02:10:54,548
Manmauji, these are the diamonds
of Bhagwanti Carnaval.

1302
02:10:54,614 --> 02:10:58,426
These are two rings which
can be encashed any where.

1303
02:10:58,484 --> 02:11:03,832
All this wealth is the result
of their youth and beauty.

1304
02:11:03,889 --> 02:11:06,893
Ask for whatever you wish!

1305
02:11:06,959 --> 02:11:11,567
What should we ask. Whatever
we need we'll take it ourselves

1306
02:11:15,868 --> 02:11:19,611
But why are you airing this
wealth. Keep it in the almirah

1307
02:11:19,672 --> 02:11:21,481
Yes, let us keep it.

1308
02:11:21,541 --> 02:11:25,148
Manmauji, get the money.

1309
02:11:42,629 --> 02:11:47,738
Now you may go, where
ever you want to!

1310
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:52,749
I wish to talk to both of them
for some time.

1311
02:11:53,439 --> 02:11:55,749
Boss, when should
I wake you up?

1312
02:11:55,808 --> 02:11:58,687
When the moon is coming out,
you may wake me.

1313
02:11:58,744 --> 02:12:03,124
But boss, tell me the time.
I don't have a calender. Go!

1314
02:12:15,661 --> 02:12:18,437
Boss, get up!
Is it morning?

1315
02:12:18,498 --> 02:12:26,417
Has the moon risen? Hurry
up. Jati and Sati have elopedl

1316
02:12:26,439 --> 02:12:31,912
What has happened to Jati, Sati.
They have dissappeared!

1317
02:12:31,977 --> 02:12:35,356
They have run away? You are
mad. Where can they go?

1318
02:12:35,414 --> 02:12:37,951
If they can come,
they can go also.

1319
02:12:38,017 --> 02:12:42,625
Ok, is the safe there only!
Safe can go nowhere. See...

1320
02:12:42,688 --> 02:12:48,104
...if there is anything inside.
Where can it go? Who can...

1321
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:51,630
...touch it. I have the key!

1322
02:12:51,697 --> 02:12:53,643
The key is there!

1323
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:17,057
Listen, where are you?

1324
02:13:17,122 --> 02:13:18,931
What is it, Radha?

1325
02:13:18,991 --> 02:13:22,803
Just look after the baby.
I am helping mother.

1326
02:13:22,862 --> 02:13:28,676
I had asked for a wish. When 40
days are over I will go to the...

1327
02:13:28,734 --> 02:13:33,444
...temple and worship there!
That is very good!

1328
02:13:33,506 --> 02:13:36,043
Take him along also!

1329
02:13:36,108 --> 02:13:39,521
No, I will not take him
out so soon. Suppose someone...

1330
02:13:39,579 --> 02:13:42,685
...casts an evil eye!
Ok, then keep him here!

1331
02:13:44,483 --> 02:13:48,488
I will just go to the goldsmith.
I will see if bangles are ready.

1332
02:13:50,423 --> 02:13:55,168
When you grow up become
like Uncle, not like Auntie.

1333
02:13:55,394 --> 02:13:59,843
You are clever. Hearing her
name, you have started crying.

1334
02:13:59,899 --> 02:14:03,403
Mother, I am messaging since
last 40 days. But there is no

1335
02:14:03,469 --> 02:14:05,471
...difference in his hand.

1336
02:14:05,538 --> 02:14:10,180
The Doctor said, keep massaging
for 2-3 months. It will become...

1337
02:14:10,409 --> 02:14:15,859
...all right. Good he was lame in
childhood. See there. Govind

1338
02:14:15,915 --> 02:14:22,924
...was born all right, but later he
became lame! Now tell, what

1339
02:14:22,988 --> 02:14:28,734
...will his child become when he
grows up! They keep hiding him...

1340
02:14:28,795 --> 02:14:32,004
...as if he is a prince!

1341
02:14:34,500 --> 02:14:40,917
I will tell you a story.
Listen...

1342
02:14:40,973 --> 02:14:49,154
My son, hear it from me.

1343
02:14:51,617 --> 02:14:58,967
My son, you are my progeny.

1344
02:14:59,025 --> 02:15:06,637
You are a boon that
I have got from God!

1345
02:15:06,699 --> 02:15:13,981
I am your father, but
I cannot feed you.

1346
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:21,481
I cannot pick you
up with both hands

1347
02:15:21,547 --> 02:15:28,590
If you want, I shall
become your horse.

1348
02:15:28,654 --> 02:15:35,037
If I can't become,
you will be a little sad.

1349
02:15:35,094 --> 02:15:42,706
But you should remember
one thing, my child

1350
02:15:52,044 --> 02:15:56,618
Let your mother's heart
be filled by your love.

1351
02:15:56,682 --> 02:16:06,364
Become your mothers guardian,
when you grow up.

1352
02:16:15,401 --> 02:16:22,046
In an unfortunate's house, has
been born a fortunate!

1353
02:16:45,964 --> 02:16:52,904
The strength of your two
hands, is your destiny.

1354
02:17:04,984 --> 02:17:12,061
Hard work is your estate!

1355
02:17:12,124 --> 02:17:19,872
One with two hands can fight
with every difficulty

1356
02:17:43,756 --> 02:17:50,970
Don't be an obstacle
in people's lives.

1357
02:18:02,808 --> 02:18:09,783
Don't sleep till your
neighbor is awake.

1358
02:18:09,848 --> 02:18:17,494
Only the fortunate take
the trouble of others.

1359
02:18:41,747 --> 02:18:48,596
Where you step, let flowers
blossom there.

1360
02:19:00,433 --> 02:19:07,043
May the parted hearts,
reunite once again.

1361
02:19:07,106 --> 02:19:14,786
Says this moon like face
that you are one with love

1362
02:20:06,064 --> 02:20:09,739
Let me see his face!
She has gone outside.

1363
02:20:09,801 --> 02:20:15,513
Goving, his face is just like
that of a king!

1364
02:20:15,574 --> 02:20:17,952
Why not, he has a
face like yours.

1365
02:20:18,010 --> 02:20:21,014
Have you named
him or not?

1366
02:20:21,079 --> 02:20:23,081
Father has thought of
Navjeevan Dass.

1367
02:20:23,148 --> 02:20:26,061
It is a name,
just like mine.

1368
02:20:26,118 --> 02:20:30,157
Why not? He is your grandson.
His Grandpa's name must come.

1369
02:20:30,389 --> 02:20:34,895
God willing, he will raise the
family name and after growing...

1370
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:37,463
...up, he becomes the support
of you and Radha.

1371
02:20:39,898 --> 02:20:48,875
Here! The first time you feed him
outside milk, feed him with this.

1372
02:20:48,941 --> 02:20:54,983
You too eat well.

1373
02:20:57,749 --> 02:21:00,593
Ok, you go now.
Bhago has come.

1374
02:21:08,994 --> 02:21:11,975
If I have wealth,
I will buy the world.

1375
02:21:12,031 --> 02:21:13,066
Come!

1376
02:21:13,131 --> 02:21:15,509
Are you playing rummy
with all these notes?

1377
02:21:15,567 --> 02:21:17,444
I was just taking stock
of office money.

1378
02:21:17,503 --> 02:21:19,039
How is the Carnival running?

1379
02:21:19,104 --> 02:21:21,516
It was running ok, and then it
stopped. But it will run again.

1380
02:21:21,573 --> 02:21:22,984
It stopped!
Meaning?

1381
02:21:23,041 --> 02:21:28,041
What to hide from you. I had
two dancers Jati and Sati.

1382
02:21:34,719 --> 02:21:38,394
They stole our Rs 70,000 and
dissappeared. Show has stopped

1383
02:21:38,457 --> 02:21:41,927
It is bad news. Did you
file a police case?

1384
02:21:41,993 --> 02:21:46,965
Those who have art, do not
go to the police. What is this...

1385
02:21:47,032 --> 02:21:51,606
...Rs 70000. I will earn 7 million
and show you! Instead of Jati...

1386
02:21:51,670 --> 02:21:54,776
...and Sati, I am going to buy an
elephant. Elephant?

1387
02:21:54,839 --> 02:21:58,048
Yes, the elephant will show his
tricks and make me rich again.

1388
02:21:58,110 --> 02:22:00,852
But I need your help. Tell me.

1389
02:22:00,912 --> 02:22:04,416
I need just Rs 10,000 for two
days. I will buy the elephant...

1390
02:22:04,483 --> 02:22:05,894
...and within two days
I will return it.

1391
02:22:05,951 --> 02:22:07,658
But I don't have that
much of money.

1392
02:22:07,719 --> 02:22:10,495
This wealth lying in front
of you is not just earth!

1393
02:22:10,555 --> 02:22:12,000
But this is office money.

1394
02:22:12,057 --> 02:22:15,129
You have not understood.
This money is lying with you.

1395
02:22:15,194 --> 02:22:17,606
For two days keep
this with me.

1396
02:22:17,663 --> 02:22:20,701
But this is a question
of my job!

1397
02:22:20,766 --> 02:22:26,682
Will I ever permit you to lose
your job. It is just a question...

1398
02:22:26,738 --> 02:22:28,513
...of two days. -But...

1399
02:22:28,573 --> 02:22:30,519
In two days, I will return every
penny and with interest.

1400
02:22:30,576 --> 02:22:35,047
But this is Rs 20,000!
Ok here is your Rs 10,000.

1401
02:22:35,113 --> 02:22:37,889
But return it definitely
after two days.

1402
02:22:37,949 --> 02:22:39,121
Certainly.

1403
02:22:41,820 --> 02:22:44,858
Have you brought the elephant?
Yes, he is standing outside.

1404
02:22:44,923 --> 02:22:47,563
Then get him inside!
How can he come inside?

1405
02:22:47,626 --> 02:22:50,573
Great, you can get in,
but not the elephant!

1406
02:22:54,900 --> 02:22:57,107
I saw your elephant outside.
He is small, but will do.

1407
02:22:57,168 --> 02:22:59,910
Here is your Rs 10,000. From
today the elephant is ours.

1408
02:22:59,972 --> 02:23:04,045
But remember, if your elephant
lets us down during the show...

1409
02:23:04,109 --> 02:23:05,679
...then I will get you
trampled over by him.

1410
02:23:05,744 --> 02:23:10,853
Sir, to rear elephants is not only
my business. It was of my dad...

1411
02:23:10,916 --> 02:23:12,862
...as well as my grandfather. I
was brought up in their company.

1412
02:23:12,917 --> 02:23:14,760
God willing, I too
am an elephant!

1413
02:23:14,820 --> 02:23:18,597
But till he gets used to us,
you will stay with us. Ok.

1414
02:23:18,657 --> 02:23:24,664
I heard your elephant can throw
up a child and catch him again!

1415
02:23:24,730 --> 02:23:26,403
No doubt, he can do that.
Then where is the child?

1416
02:23:26,465 --> 02:23:28,411
That you will have
to arrange for.

1417
02:23:28,466 --> 02:23:31,777
I kept Rs 20000 with you.
And you have misappropriated...

1418
02:23:31,836 --> 02:23:33,509
...Rs 10000 out of it!

1419
02:23:33,572 --> 02:23:37,987
Don't say missappropriation, sir.
I had given this sum to my

1420
02:23:38,043 --> 02:23:40,045
...relative for two days,
to help him.

1421
02:23:40,112 --> 02:23:43,491
Is that not theft. I don't want to
hear this nonsense!

1422
02:23:43,548 --> 02:23:47,018
Just give me two days.
I pray to you.

1423
02:23:47,085 --> 02:23:51,124
Why two days. I want my money
by tomorrow. If you don't I will...

1424
02:23:51,356 --> 02:23:56,032
...hand you over to the police.
I want my money by tomorrow...

1425
02:23:56,094 --> 02:23:58,005
...morning, understood!

1426
02:24:02,367 --> 02:24:05,109
No, he will not do.
Not even this one.

1427
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:08,873
This boy is too thin.
His bones will break.

1428
02:24:10,642 --> 02:24:14,146
This boy looks all right. Yes,
how much will you take for him.

1429
02:24:14,379 --> 02:24:16,757
I don't want to sell him.
- I too don't want to buy...

1430
02:24:16,815 --> 02:24:19,853
...and pickle him. He has to work
in the carnival. What work?

1431
02:24:19,918 --> 02:24:22,990
It is a very interesting work.
Every evening some 10 minutes...

1432
02:24:23,054 --> 02:24:24,192
...of work, and Rs. 20 earning.

1433
02:24:24,422 --> 02:24:28,063
We will keep the child on the
trunk of an elephant. For some...

1434
02:24:28,126 --> 02:24:30,572
...time he will play with the
child. Then he will toss him...

1435
02:24:30,629 --> 02:24:32,506
...in the air
Oh my god!

1436
02:24:32,564 --> 02:24:35,010
Listen! After tossing him, he will
catch him back and put him on..

1437
02:24:35,066 --> 02:24:36,841
...The ground.
No, I'll not give my child.

1438
02:24:36,902 --> 02:24:39,348
Fool, he is a trained elephant.
He loves children more than...

1439
02:24:39,404 --> 02:24:40,781
a mother.
No, no.

1440
02:24:40,839 --> 02:24:45,549
On top you will get Rs. 20 per
day. No, I'll not give my child.

1441
02:24:45,610 --> 02:24:47,351
Then go from here,
and continue to beg

1442
02:24:47,412 --> 02:24:54,557
Listen to me! You want to put
our children into danger? Lets go

1443
02:24:54,619 --> 02:24:58,431
Just listen to me!

1444
02:25:00,158 --> 02:25:02,764
You had said there would be no
problem to arrange a child!

1445
02:25:02,827 --> 02:25:05,933
How did I know they will kick
fortune and go away like this!

1446
02:25:05,998 --> 02:25:14,918
Problem. Tickets have been sold.
Posters put in place!

1447
02:25:14,973 --> 02:25:18,045
If I had known, I would have
married a year and half back.

1448
02:25:18,109 --> 02:25:19,713
We wouldn't have
faced this problem.

1449
02:25:19,777 --> 02:25:22,553
Manmauji, you are still
playing the joker!

1450
02:25:22,614 --> 02:25:27,586
With great difficulty I got the
money, then the elephant and...

1451
02:25:27,652 --> 02:25:29,598
...after all this effort, for want
of a child everything will go

1452
02:25:29,654 --> 02:25:32,658
...wastel For want of one child!

1453
02:25:34,526 --> 02:25:37,507
Brother! What is it?
You are sweating in winter also!

1454
02:25:37,562 --> 02:25:39,564
Come with me,
I will tell you.

1455
02:25:39,631 --> 02:25:42,703
Is it an indoor issue.
Come with me!

1456
02:25:44,535 --> 02:25:48,813
I want my money and now
or I lose my job and respect.

1457
02:25:48,873 --> 02:25:53,686
He has warned me, if I don't
return his money he will hand...

1458
02:25:53,745 --> 02:25:55,122
...me over to the police.

1459
02:25:55,346 --> 02:25:58,020
But where can I get you the
money now. I bought the

1460
02:25:58,083 --> 02:26:00,529
...elephant yesterday only.
If you believe me take the...

1461
02:26:00,585 --> 02:26:02,587
...elephant to your owner
and show it to him.

1462
02:26:02,654 --> 02:26:07,660
This is no time to fool.
If I don't pay, I will go to jail.

1463
02:26:07,726 --> 02:26:09,103
What will happen to my
family name?

1464
02:26:09,161 --> 02:26:11,732
As if I am not bothered about
your family name. It is now...

1465
02:26:11,797 --> 02:26:13,572
...a question of my
sister's life also.

1466
02:26:13,631 --> 02:26:17,044
But I am helpless.
I cannot do anything.

1467
02:26:17,102 --> 02:26:21,414
Idea! Your village is close by.
Go there and get the money.

1468
02:26:21,473 --> 02:26:25,888
There is no bank in the village.
There is only land and a house.

1469
02:26:25,944 --> 02:26:29,756
But isn't property wealth? And
half of the property is now on...

1470
02:26:29,814 --> 02:26:31,987
...your name. Mortgage that
and get the money.

1471
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:33,859
With what face can
I go there.

1472
02:26:33,919 --> 02:26:37,025
After marriage, I haven't seen
Neelima and the child. Nor have...

1473
02:26:37,088 --> 02:26:40,865
...I sent any money. How can I
mortgage the land and house now

1474
02:26:40,925 --> 02:26:45,135
Ah yes, after coming from the
village, two kids are born there

1475
02:26:45,363 --> 02:26:49,539
One to Neelima and one
in that lame ducks house.

1476
02:26:51,602 --> 02:26:53,741
Sham, come to the Carnival at
night and take the money.

1477
02:26:57,542 --> 02:27:01,149
Radha, what has happened to
Nlunna. He isn't keeping quiet.

1478
02:27:01,380 --> 02:27:05,453
I wonder who has cast the evil
eye. He keeps extending his...

1479
02:27:05,517 --> 02:27:08,828
...arms and looks towards me.

1480
02:27:54,499 --> 02:27:57,446
Fire!

1481
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:04,852
Shankar, your fields
are on fire!

1482
02:28:04,910 --> 02:28:08,790
Uncle! What happened?
- He says my fields are on fire.

1483
02:28:11,649 --> 02:28:13,993
Our fields are on fire!
Oh my god!

1484
02:28:39,777 --> 02:28:45,955
Uncle! Father! He set the
fields on fire!

1485
02:28:46,017 --> 02:28:49,089
Beat him up!

1486
02:28:49,153 --> 02:28:53,863
Halt! Why are you beating me.
I only obeyed my masters orders.

1487
02:28:53,925 --> 02:29:02,174
The fields are anyway burnt
Now save your Nlunna. He has...

1488
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:04,641
...plans to take your child to the
carnival. Save him!

1489
02:29:56,587 --> 02:29:57,759
What happened to Nlunna?

1490
02:30:13,705 --> 02:30:15,810
Please help me, take me to
the city. Come sister!

1491
02:30:53,878 --> 02:30:56,984
Hey, where are you going?

1492
02:30:57,048 --> 02:30:59,722
Out you go!

1493
02:31:41,592 --> 02:31:42,468
My Child!

1494
02:31:43,995 --> 02:31:46,874
Where are you going?
- Let me go. My Nlunna is inside.

1495
02:31:46,931 --> 02:31:48,467
Who Nlunna?
My child.

1496
02:31:52,637 --> 02:31:59,680
Ladies and Gentlemen. For the
finale, we present to you a

1497
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:05,558
...breath-taking spectacle.
So hold your heart and see!

1498
02:32:05,616 --> 02:32:07,425
Go and get the child!

1499
02:32:07,485 --> 02:32:14,425
The Hero of this show is this
Elephant, the King of the Forest.

1500
02:32:14,492 --> 02:32:19,100
And the second hero is this
young boy Rocky.

1501
02:32:21,766 --> 02:32:25,737
Raja will hold Rocky in his trunk
and toss him in the air!

1502
02:32:25,803 --> 02:32:30,081
What happens next is
what you must watch!

1503
02:32:46,024 --> 02:32:49,972
What happened to my money!
You will just get it?

1504
02:32:50,027 --> 02:32:51,370
Will you drink this nectar?

1505
02:32:51,429 --> 02:32:53,602
I want my money quickly.

1506
02:33:16,420 --> 02:33:18,491
What happened to you?
Nothing has happened to him.

1507
02:33:18,556 --> 02:33:20,729
Give me the child.

1508
02:33:25,429 --> 02:33:27,807
Leave my child!

1509
02:33:43,781 --> 02:33:45,920
Your hand! Your legs!

1510
02:34:06,904 --> 02:34:10,750
Saw my Singapuri hands. Now
I will sort out both of you!

1511
02:34:18,116 --> 02:34:20,027
Navrangi, what have you done?

1512
02:34:21,085 --> 02:34:27,525
Haven't your eyes opened yet. He
set fire to our fields. He stole...

1513
02:34:27,592 --> 02:34:32,439
...Nlunna and put him into the
jaws of death. Still you ask

1514
02:34:32,496 --> 02:34:35,602
...this fool, 'Navrangi,
what have you done?'

1515
02:34:35,666 --> 02:34:37,577
Should I tell you, what
all he hasn't done!

1516
02:34:37,968 --> 02:34:44,112
Don't say anything also
I am already ashamed.

1517
02:34:45,943 --> 02:34:51,825
You satan, when you were born,
surely a temple must have been...

1518
02:34:51,883 --> 02:34:56,093
...set on fire! May God
send you to hell.

1519
02:34:56,154 --> 02:35:01,001
Auntie, I am your family's
last symbol on earth.

1520
02:35:01,058 --> 02:35:03,402
If this symbol is removed from
this earth, it will be better.

1521
02:35:03,461 --> 02:35:08,137
So now sister is speaking. What
all I did, was for you only.

1522
02:35:08,366 --> 02:35:12,007
Those who do good are
now being criticised!

1523
02:35:15,773 --> 02:35:19,016
See, an educated person like me
who was in Singapore, is being...

1524
02:35:19,076 --> 02:35:20,020
...sent to jail!

1525
02:35:20,078 --> 02:35:22,854
And these cow dung pickers
are out of jail.

1526
02:35:24,882 --> 02:35:29,627
Bless me as I have made you
hands & legs to work.

1527
02:35:30,721 --> 02:35:33,463
Manmauji, have they handcuffed
you before me. Ok. let us go!

1528
02:35:39,930 --> 02:35:42,001
See Tau, my leg is all right,
and so is my hand!

1529
02:35:46,938 --> 02:35:48,918
Who is it who will
make the first strike.

1530
02:35:48,973 --> 02:35:50,008
That right is mine.

1531
02:35:50,074 --> 02:35:51,849
No, Tau, I will break
the first brick.

1532
02:35:51,909 --> 02:35:55,584
Your Tai will break it! She
only had erected this wall!

1533
02:35:55,647 --> 02:35:58,150
Take this, Tai.

1534
02:36:06,423 --> 02:36:10,371
Whatever God does is for the
better. There is perhaps delay...

1535
02:36:10,428 --> 02:36:12,999
...in his court,
but not darkness.

1536
02:36:13,064 --> 02:36:16,705
Oh, we forgot, today is Janma
shtami, birthday of our Lord!

1537
02:36:20,371 --> 02:36:23,750
Truth and love will
always prevail.

1538
02:36:23,808 --> 02:36:30,851
Cruelty & evil will
always be destroyed.

1539
02:36:30,915 --> 02:36:33,915
Religion & morality will prevail
for ages.
