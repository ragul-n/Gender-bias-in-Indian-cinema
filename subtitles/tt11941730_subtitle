3
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,240
My beloved's charming street

4
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,330
Wherever my desire takes me

5
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,850
My beloved's charming street

6
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,090
Where I spent my delightful childhood

7
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,360
Where I spent my vibrant world

8
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,640
Where my youth blossomed

9
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,030
My beloved's charming street

10
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,070
In my dreams...

11
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,420
He comes in my dreams covertly

12
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,660
He comes...

13
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,360
in my heartbeats

14
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,200
He dwells in my heartbeats

15
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,890
He dwells

16
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,510
Dormant affection...

17
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,600
He arouses dormant affection

18
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,620
He makes my heart more fearful

19
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,140
My beloved's charming street

20
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,890
I feel shy when he comes before me

21
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,040
I feel nervous when he comes near me

22
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,600
He is my beloved.
I am his sweetheart

23
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,160
My beloved's charming street

24
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,780
Pot breaker, please come forward.

25
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,160
Who called me?

26
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,600
I'm here.

27
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,360
What if my pot had broken?

28
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,700
I'd have gotten a brass pot for you.

29
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,196
Yes. The brass pot would have put me...

30
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,250
in junior Chaudhary's debt.

31
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,090
Razia.

32
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,790
It's not right to call your childhood
friend Aslam as junior Chaudhary.

33
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,960
That was childhood immaturity.
But now, we're grown up.

34
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,260
That's why I know that
you live in a mansion.

35
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,460
And I live in a mud house.

36
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,260
Razia, in childhood we would build
sand houses and exchange them.

37
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,480
So why can't you consider
my mansion as your house?

38
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,770
Aslam, your talk might make me proud.

39
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,110
If beauty is not proud,
even love doesn't bow before it.

40
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,176
Razia, for the last time,
I'm separating from you...

41
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,210
and going to the city
to finish my education.

42
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,700
- What are you saying?
- Don't worry, Razia.

43
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,280
Once I return
we'll never separate again.

44
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,370
- Hello, junior Chaudhary.
- Hello.

45
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,160
May God grant integrity!

46
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,640
Today I discovered that
junior Chaudhary has grown up.

47
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,686
Insolent! If you behave
insolently with me...

48
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,410
I'll have you banished
from the village.

49
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,000
May God grant integrity!

50
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,150
We barbers are so respected
that prominent landlords...

51
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,370
bow their heads in front of us for hours.

52
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,130
- Kalu, stop your nonsense.
- May God grant integrity!

53
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,620
You?

54
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,840
Razia, congratulations.

55
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,320
What's the good news for which
you're congratulating me?

56
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,710
- Razia, Aslam...
- Quiet.

57
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,210
Shameless. Seems like
you overheard everything.

58
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,640
And I saw it too.

59
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,030
Your thirst was quenched.

60
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,960
So you returned from the well
with an empty pot.

61
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,680
Oh yes! It's empty.

62
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,200
Out of fear of your brother.

63
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,680
Kalu, where did you sell your instruments?

64
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,840
Look. It's growing in God's devotion.

65
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,760
It's better you let it grow.

66
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,030
You'll receive blessings!
May God grant integrity!

67
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,360
Kalu, you seem upset today.
What's the matter?

68
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,170
What's the matter? Why?

69
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,940
- Don't barbers have any honor?
- Why not?

70
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,680
- I'll go and tell Mr. Chaudhary.
- What happened?

71
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,910
I'm not a gossipmonger.

72
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,680
Don't tell anyone.

73
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,526
Junior Chaudhary loves Razia.
May God grant integrity!

74
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,550
- Is that so?
- That's what I'm going to tell him.

75
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,100
You stopped me needlessly.

76
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,560
Hello, Mr. Chaudhary.

77
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,610
Hello. How did you come on Tuesday today?

78
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,880
May God grant integrity!

79
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,290
Mars is such a planet.

80
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,030
You think something and
something else happens.

81
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,730
- What do you mean?
- Well...

82
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm not a gossipmonger.

83
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,650
But I'm loyal to you.
So I'm compelled to tell you...

84
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,586
that junior Chaudhary loves Razia,
who lives in a mud house.

85
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,010
May God grant integrity!

86
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,569
How do you know?

87
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,610
I saw it myself.
May God grant integrity!

88
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,080
Childhood friends won't fight.

89
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,780
And it's your habit to make
a mountain out of a molehill.

90
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,000
It's not a lie.
May God grant integrity!

91
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,470
Good. Let Aslam go to the city
for his education.

92
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,950
Everything will be fine.

93
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,250
Razia, I'll carry a pot.

94
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,550
Salma, you're Chaudhary's niece.

95
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,150
Why take the trouble?

96
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,080
It's every woman's duty
to do housework.

97
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,160
Whether she's rich or poor.

98
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,110
My hands are working fine.

99
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,240
You always consider me a stranger.

100
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,140
I should think of you as kin
and make you fill water every day.

101
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,760
Leave it. I'll do it.

102
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,920
Salma, if you like it so much,
then carry my pot.

103
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,410
Want me to fill the pot.

104
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,320
Okay, son. It's time
for your train. Now leave.

105
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,690
But yes, don't forget to write letters.

106
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,300
Listen.

107
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,360
- Do reply to my letters.
- Okay.

108
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,180
- Okay, father. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

109
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,270
Aunt.

110
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,120
- Hello, aunt.
- God bless you, son.

111
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
Don't forget the villagers
after going to the city.

112
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,620
How can I forget all of you?

113
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,080
I'm leaving my life in the village.

114
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,490
Keep visiting us.

115
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,680
Okay, goodbye.

116
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,490
Goodbye, Razia.

117
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,960
Goodbye.

118
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,800
Hey! Oh God!

119
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,320
Oh, my God! You, Banno?

120
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,510
Being a woman, you hit a man?

121
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,760
Why? You wanted to commit theft.

122
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,660
What did you say? Thief?

123
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,590
Don't you recognize decent people?

124
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh God, Banno! I came for a shave.

125
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,760
I'm sorry. Sit. Brother must be coming.

126
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,110
Sister gave me a thrashing
before the brother's arrival.

127
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,450
No. I'll leave.

128
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,970
Listen.

129
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,440
Don't tell brother I hit you.

130
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,650
Oh God, Banno!
Would any man say that?

131
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,910
Then go.

132
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,960
- May I ask you something, Banno?
- Yes.

133
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,050
- You didn't do the right thing.
- What?

134
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,680
What was the need to hit a dying man?

135
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,240
Are you ill?

136
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,750
Not just ill,
I'm lying on my deathbed.

137
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,100
Deathbed?

138
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,570
Then make arrangements for your funeral.

139
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,270
- If brother comes, he'll also...
- Show the wonder of his hands.

140
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,140
Okay. Goodbye.

141
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,570
Hello, Hazarimal.

142
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,300
Hello, Kalu.

143
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,986
May God grant integrity!

144
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,610
Do you want your beard shaved?

145
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,840
- Yes, Kalu. Something like that.
- Come here.

146
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,960
You're clean-shaven.

147
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,370
Yes. It's done, Kalu.
I'll leave. It's done.

148
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,060
- It's done.
- Yes. It's done.

149
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,590
It's done. It's done.

150
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
- Brother. - Yes.
- Freshen up.

151
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,920
Then eat lunch.

152
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,870
You eat lunch.

153
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,630
I'll eat a feast.
May God grant integrity!

154
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,080
- Is that so?
- Yes.

155
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,830
Fix people's marriage
and have a feast.

156
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,840
Whose marriage did you arrange?

157
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,220
It's none of your business.
Go and eat lunch.

158
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,400
I'll take Razia and aunt to Chaudhary.

159
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,240
May God grant integrity!

160
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,760
May God grant integrity, Mr. Chaudhary!

161
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,990
- Aunt is here.
- Come. - Hello.

162
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,420
- Hello.
- Greetings.

163
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,920
God bless you, dear.

164
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,300
Salma.

165
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,060
Look, your aunt is here.

166
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,210
Sit.

167
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,020
Both of you go inside.

168
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,510
Sister, I troubled you for a noble deed.

169
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,640
It's no trouble, Mr. Chaudhary.

170
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,470
I'll give you good news.

171
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,860
I've chosen a boy for your daughter Razia.

172
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,440
Before Aslam, I'm worried about Nazir.

173
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,690
Yes, the late Bashir's son, right?

174
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,070
You know he's a nice boy.
I have to conduct his marriage.

175
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,906
What say you?

176
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,040
When you're his guardian,
what objection can I have?

177
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,070
It's done, sister. Razia and Nazir
will get married on Friday.

178
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,340
Once Aslam returns from the city...

179
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,870
I'll marry him to Salma.

180
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,500
Congratulations to both of you.
May God grant integrity!

181
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,800
Congratulations, sister.

182
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,280
You have got such a suitable groom.

183
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,120
You're crying?

184
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,760
If poor people are
destined for happiness...

185
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,690
why would they cry?

186
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,530
- Kalu. - Yes?
- Tell the truth. - Sure.

187
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,900
To whom is uncle marrying me?

188
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,610
- Tell me.
- Shall I tell you? - Yes.

189
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,100
- For sure?
- Yes.

190
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,760
First give me five pennies.
May God grant integrity!

191
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,440
Oh my! Here.

192
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,860
- Yes.
- Now tell me.

193
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,890
- Your marriage will be conducted...
- Yes.

194
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,690
With Razia who lives in a mud house.
May God grant integrity!

195
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,760
- Kalu. - Yes.
- Is she very pretty?

196
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,970
Yes. It's your good fortune
that you got her.

197
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,160
- May God grant integrity!
- For sure. For sure.

198
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,926
Shall I distribute the wedding invitations?

199
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,240
- Sure. Sure. Go. Don't delay.
- Okay. Goodbye.

200
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,906
Mister, covertly

201
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,280
Sir, don't meet covertly

202
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't meet

203
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,870
Don't converse through the eyes

204
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,760
Don't converse

205
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,050
Mister, covertly

206
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,400
Sir, don't meet covertly

207
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,280
Don't meet

208
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,990
Don't converse through the eyes

209
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,200
Don't converse

210
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,880
Don't look at me with sly eyes

211
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,800
Sly eyes

212
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,970
A voice emanates from my heart

213
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,900
From my heart

214
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,330
Don't drop the curtain
and turn day into night

215
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,210
Don't turn day into night

216
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,850
Don't converse through the eyes

217
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,770
Don't converse

218
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,930
Mister, covertly

219
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,290
Sir, don't meet covertly

220
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,240
Don't meet

221
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,810
The Punjabi man says
I'm the queen of his heart

222
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,000
The Marathi man says
you're a gorgeous woman

223
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:11,420
The Marwadi man says
you have a beautiful face

224
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,970
The Gujarati man says
you dance splendidly

225
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,620
Don't talk about this man from Delhi...

226
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,070
this moustache man,
this man carrying a stick

227
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,880
Yes, don't talk

228
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:44,520
Don't converse through the eyes

229
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,430
Don't converse

230
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,730
Mister, covertly

231
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,050
Sir, don't meet covertly

232
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,920
Yes. Don't meet

233
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,640
Don't converse through the eyes

234
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,630
Yes. Don't converse

235
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,170
Junior Chaudhary,
may God bless you!

236
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,960
May God grant patience
to this unfortunate Razia.

237
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,800
Because decent girls sacrifice
their love and life...

238
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,720
for their elders' happiness.

239
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,640
Aslam, now forget me.

240
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,240
Forget this wretched Razia's face forever.

241
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,480
When you read this letter...

242
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,820
Razia's funeral must be going on.

243
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,660
Helpless Razia who is
going away from you forever.

244
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,910
Hats off to our country's docile girls.

245
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,760
They sacrifice their love,
desires and life for their...

246
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,020
elders' happiness and husband's service.

247
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,210
This isn't a wedding procession.

248
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,220
It's a funeral procession
of Razia's desires.

249
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,390
These aren't fireworks...

250
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,810
but poor Razia's desires
that are exploding.

251
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,600
The entire village is
watching the spectacle.

252
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,290
Not a sigh escapes from Razia's lips.

253
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,700
Chaudhary gave a loan to Nazir...

254
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,510
and separated Razia from Aslam.

255
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,880
A heart spoke and another heart heard

256
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,800
A tragic saga

257
00:20:52,110 --> 00:21:00,110
This cruel world breaks
the relations of love

258
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,570
A heart spoke

259
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,840
In the grief for her lover...

260
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,520
the girl cries and burns

261
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:46,780
Seeing the girl burning,
her lover also burns

262
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,040
A heart spoke

263
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:10,870
See a tender flower

264
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,620
There are infinite thorns hidden

265
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,260
Who is our kin in this world?

266
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,780
Who is a stranger?

267
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,440
A heart spoke

268
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:52,010
In the remembrance of the one
who is leaving...

269
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:59,130
my eyes shed tears and say

270
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:26,920
It's okay to die,
but don't ever fall in love

271
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,460
A heart spoke and another heart heard

272
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,210
A tragic saga

273
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:54,550
This cruel world breaks
the relations of love

274
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,430
A heart spoke

275
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,680
Why did you stop?

276
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,260
Nazir, first go and tell her
to cover her face.

277
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,530
Cover it? In front of you?

278
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,960
Oh no! Why cover her face? Come on.

279
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,310
- Come on.
- Let's go.

280
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,890
Have a seat.

281
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,020
You guys also sit.

282
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,010
Razia.

283
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,950
Come here.

284
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,960
Today I'll introduce you
to my greatest enemy.

285
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,000
Nazir. Oh God!

286
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,670
There are two friends too.

287
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,170
Come here. I'll tell you
who they are.

288
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,900
Okay, I'll come.

289
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,610
I'm fed up with this.
You're still here.

290
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,610
- Come on.
- Where?

291
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,130
My friends have come.

292
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,000
No. I feel shy going
in front of strangers.

293
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,190
They aren't strangers.
They're like my brothers.

294
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,750
Come on. Come.

295
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,360
Your veil has bothered me no end. Come.

296
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,950
He's that enemy. Sadiq.

297
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,360
Sister-in-law, hello.

298
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,110
Hello.

299
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,080
I don't know
what to present to you.

300
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,800
No need for this formality.
Come. Let's have dinner. Come.

301
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,600
Salma, sit. I'll show you a spectacle.

302
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,040
No. I can't stay with useless girls
like you even for a moment.

303
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,920
- Her beloved has come.
- Let him come.

304
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,640
He's not taking her away.

305
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,210
All of you envious girls
are untrustworthy.

306
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,810
I wouldn't even talk
to such an ungrateful man.

307
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,700
If you say anything against him,
I'll smash your face.

308
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,450
Forget it, forget it.

309
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,850
Look, you shouldn't even
mention his name.

310
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,280
Just see all the things
she's saying about him.

311
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,290
You wrote so many letters.
Did he send any reply?

312
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,120
He must not have time
from his studies.

313
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,870
That's why he didn't reply.

314
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,240
No matter what you say,
I'm envious of him.

315
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,740
Why?

316
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,800
He'll take our darling friend
away from us.

317
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,040
Look, Salma. She's making him a villain.

318
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,890
If God wills,
she'll also marry a villain.

319
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,040
Razia.

320
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,960
Razia, junior Chaudhary has come.

321
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,530
- Won't you come to meet him?
- No, Banno.

322
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:03,880
A married woman shouldn't mention
an unknown man's name.

323
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,220
Great! You were in love
with him once upon a time.

324
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,980
Today he's become a stranger.

325
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,890
That was our childhood.

326
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,760
For God's sake,
don't remind me about him.

327
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,430
Go. Let me fulfill my duty.

328
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,400
Razia, you've changed completely.

329
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,840
I haven't changed. The world has changed.

330
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,180
God wills that Aslam
leads a happy life with Salma.

331
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,740
- Hello.
- Bless you.

332
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,640
Stop it. You've studied enough.

333
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,190
- No need to study now.
- Why?

334
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,140
Because I've arrived.

335
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,400
- You're not so pretty.
- I'm better looking than you.

336
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,080
You're mistaken.

337
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,170
Me or you?

338
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,070
The one who thinks she's beautiful.

339
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,350
You also think you're very handsome.

340
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,430
Had I been handsome, there
wouldn't have been any grief.

341
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,580
Why don't you say
you're upset with me?

342
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,550
No.

343
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,180
Of course.

344
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,240
The world teases me by your name.

345
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,800
And you don't even
speak to me properly.

346
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,600
You've come after a long time.

347
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,070
You didn't even ask me how I was.

348
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,760
It's true. Men are heartless.

349
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,730
Say something else.

350
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,280
With God's grace, Aslam is young
and Salma is also young.

351
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,910
That's what I also mean.

352
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,670
The boy passed his BA.
The girl is also educated.

353
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,336
In the entire village Chaudhary's
house is the only house...

354
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,490
where there's an educated girl.
May God grant integrity!

355
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,040
Priest, it's every parent's
duty to educate their children.

356
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,240
May God grant integrity, Mr Choudhary.

357
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,410
Don't delay it now.
Get them married quickly.

358
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,830
As if it's not marriage,
but a game.

359
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,280
May God grant integrity, Mr. Chaudhary.

360
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,470
For a long time there hasn't been
a dance program in the village.

361
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,780
There will be one
as part of the marriage.

362
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,120
Arrange for the dance program.

363
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,740
Take money from me.

364
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,640
That's what I wanted. May God
grant integrity, Mr. Chaudhary!

365
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,880
Eyes...

366
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Don't shoot arrows from the eyes

367
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,480
Beloved, I am 16 years old

368
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,720
I don't like your figure

369
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,320
I don't like it without you

370
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,840
What kind of unique love is this?

371
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,910
Beloved, I am 16 years old

372
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,270
Eyes...

373
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,080
Don't shoot arrows from the eyes

374
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,090
It's a vibrant world.

375
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,560
Your love is what I desire

376
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,150
It's a short life

377
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,020
Beloved, I am 16 years old

378
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,560
Eyes...

379
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,370
Don't shoot arrows from the eyes

380
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,660
We took oaths and fell in love

381
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,990
Why did you lock eyes with a stranger then?

382
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,640
Beloved, your love is not true

383
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,260
Beloved, I am 16 years old

384
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,830
Eyes...

385
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,600
Don't shoot arrows from the eyes

386
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,810
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

387
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,200
Come, Nazir. Sit.

388
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,860
- Where are you going?
- I was going to the fields, uncle.

389
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,880
Son, take care of the garden too.

390
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,120
I'm alone, uncle. How much can I do?

391
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,570
Do I have hundreds of men?

392
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,170
God bless brother Bashir.
He was also alone.

393
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,460
I work as hard as I can, uncle.

394
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,710
Do you call sitting
on a cot working hard?

395
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,680
How will the work be done?

396
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,640
I don't care about that.
I'll do as much as I can.

397
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,680
It means you don't realize
you have to repay my debt too.

398
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,690
I'll repay it when I have money.
I won't give up my life over a debt.

399
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,720
You are also right.

400
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,290
How will you arrange for money
when you don't have any?

401
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,680
Be grateful to God, Nazir.
I lent you money.

402
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,380
If you had borrowed money
from a moneylender...

403
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,630
he'd have seized your house,
not to mention the garden.

404
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,170
May God grant integrity!

405
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,270
Moneylenders are very cruel.

406
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,830
Look, Nazir. I'll explain something to you.

407
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,120
If you heed me, sell the garden to me.

408
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,630
I'll give you the rest
of the money right now.

409
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,530
You've given me a tight slap, uncle.

410
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,550
I'm poor, but not a cheater.

411
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,850
I owe you money,
But I'm not dishonest.

412
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,060
I'm ready to sell myself.

413
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,520
But I'm not ready
to sell my ancestor's garden.

414
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,320
If you're truly a principled man,
give the proof.

415
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,750
If God wills, you'll get it soon.

416
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,400
Sister-in-law.

417
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,210
Where are you going?

418
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,569
My husband is in the fields.
I'm taking food for him.

419
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,539
In this scorching heat?

420
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,410
Heat doesn't bother us villagers.

421
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,650
You city people should fear it.

422
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:31,839
A flower withers in heat,
sister-in-law.

423
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,279
As long as the flower is
attached to the branch...

424
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,199
it doesn't face any danger.

425
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,230
You're so disloyal, sister-in-law.

426
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,320
I've come to see you.
And you don't even care for me.

427
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,030
A woman's life revolves
around her husband.

428
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,360
It's every woman's duty to
look after her husband's comfort.

429
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,720
This is your goodness, Razia.

430
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:00,100
You're beautiful.
Moreover, loyal too. It's great.

431
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:06,010
Razia, your pride lies in ruling hearts.

432
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,690
Why are you saying all this?

433
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:17,280
I mean, at times God also plays
a prank on his men.

434
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,440
He gave a gem to a blind man.

435
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,840
He gave wealth to an insane man.

436
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,210
Nazir won't value your goodness.

437
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:30,800
If a beautiful girl like you
had married a man like me...

438
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,540
I swear, Razia...

439
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,200
your name would have been famous
all over the world.

440
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,960
Remain in your senses.

441
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,840
From the time I first saw you,
I lost my senses.

442
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,920
Aren't you ashamed to speak
to another woman like that?

443
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:52,000
When my friend isn't a stranger
why would you be a stranger?

444
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,480
Shameless.

445
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,060
Amazing, sister-in-law!

446
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:58,660
- You look pretty even in anger.
- Shut up.

447
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,326
Go home.

448
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,810
I'll come with you.

449
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,110
I'm not going to run away.

450
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,920
Go. Go home.

451
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,870
Sadiq goes to your home all the time.
I don't like it.

452
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:22,310
Razia, Sadiq is always
welcome in my house.

453
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,800
You should know that Sadiq
is my childhood friend.

454
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,580
I trust his friendship completely.

455
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,420
You should trust him too.

456
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,360
I don't trust people blindly.

457
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,510
He seems to be a dangerous man.

458
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,160
I won't hear anything
against my friend.

459
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,420
- And I can't say anything in his favor.
- Razia!

460
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,290
Go. Don't make this mistake again.

461
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,000
May God grant integrity, Mr. Chaudhary!

462
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,750
Nazir will have
to sell the garden to you.

463
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,870
God forbid, Kalu.
I'm not greedy for his garden.

464
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:13,630
I just wanted to see whether
Nazir has his ancestor's dignity.

465
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,600
Who's concerned about money?

466
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,560
The way I gave it to Aslam,
I gave it to Nazir too.

467
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,740
Really?

468
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,840
I'll work hard to repay Chaudhary's loan.

469
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,270
But the garden, that
my ancestors have grown with...

470
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,590
their sweat and blood,
is a beautiful part of my life...

471
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,400
and I have a right to it.

472
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,560
Remember, Sadiq. I'll do anything for it.

473
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,840
But I won't let strangers
get hold of it.

474
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,580
Long live, Nazir!

475
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,280
If this is how the youths
of our village think...

476
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,670
then we'll definitely change our fortunes.

477
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,230
Here. This is a diamond ring.

478
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,600
Sell it and buy happiness for yourself.

479
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,800
Take it.

480
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,010
I don't mind ruining my life, Sadiq.

481
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,560
But I can't sell it. Here.

482
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,960
It means you don't trust my friendship.

483
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:21,780
I trust your friendship
more than myself, Sadiq.

484
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,800
So why are you refusing
to take the ring?

485
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,690
Because debt is friendship's enemy.

486
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,740
Stop this nonsense. Here.

487
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,210
I don't want to take this ring

488
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,850
If you sympathize with me,
show me some other way.

489
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,490
Yes. Go to Lahore and
meet Rahim Bakht today.

490
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,350
He's a bank director.

491
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,750
He'll give you money immediately.

492
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,240
I'll write him a letter today.

493
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,640
How will he recover the money?

494
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,761
You'll have to give him fruits
and food grains every year.

495
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,030
In a few years
the money will be repaid.

496
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,180
And your honor will also be saved.

497
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,150
Sadiq, I will definitely go.

498
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,340
You've given me new hope.

499
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,710
I'll go and tell Razia.

500
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,370
Don't make this mistake, Nazir.

501
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,550
Woman is man's biggest weakness.

502
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,956
You'll be ready to sacrifice
your family's honor...

503
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,040
if you see Razia shed a few tears.

504
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,450
Okay. Take care of Razia in my absence.

505
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,100
- I'll leave.
- Don't worry, my friend.

506
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,880
- Okay. Bye.
- Goodbye.

507
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,290
Nazir has left for the station.

508
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:43,200
He shouldn't return to the village
or reach the station.

509
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,550
Understand?

510
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,900
Here.

511
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,380
Diamond ring. It's worth Rs.500.

512
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,250
Once the work is done you will
be paid more than your expectations.

513
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,830
That's it?

514
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,960
Okay, Sadiq. I trust you.

515
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,870
Tonight I also have work
at that same place.

516
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
I'll finish off Nazir too.

517
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,420
I'll finish off Nazir too.

518
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:52,880
Oh Lord! The caravan of life never stops

519
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,170
O Lord! It never stops

520
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:23,190
We cover the journey of life happily

521
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:35,200
All of us reach to our destinations

522
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,800
Oh Lord! We never stop

523
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:52,606
Oh Lord! The caravan of life never stops

524
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,920
Oh Lord! It never stops

525
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,510
Oh Lord! Two worlds

526
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,600
The town of every caravan

527
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:33,090
The journey gets covered easily

528
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,020
No trouble befalls

529
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,120
Oh Lord! It never stops

530
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,950
O Lord! The caravan of life never stops

531
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,800
Help! Help!

532
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,160
Help!

533
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,750
Help! Help!

534
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,640
What's going on?

535
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,890
Don't you people fear God?

536
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,270
How have the poor people harmed you?
Why are you troubling them?

537
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,390
Who are you to stop us?
Get lost. Do your work.

538
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,696
Beware.

539
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,220
Why did you stop, sir?

540
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,880
Ramlal's body is burning.

541
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,000
- Go and bring his bones.
- Huh?

542
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,740
Oh, my God!

543
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,450
Are you hungry?

544
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:51,550
Oh, my God! Don't you know?

545
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,560
Sir has come up with an idea.

546
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,210
Not at all.

547
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:56,830
Lamp lights lamp.

548
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,390
Today I want to start
a fire with fire.

549
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,500
Oh, my God!

550
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,510
Whose house do you want to destroy?
Tell us clearly.

551
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,160
Put Ramlal's bones in Nazir's house.

552
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,010
- And set it ablaze.
- Oh, my God!

553
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,460
Go, quickly.

554
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,290
- Here.
- Give.

555
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,210
- Wazir.
- Yes.

556
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,440
Inform the village that Nazir
has has been charred.

557
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,120
Beware.

558
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:29,950
Nazir, it's you.

559
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:33,520
Met you at the right time.
I was looking for you.

560
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,040
Who? Mehmood?

561
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,050
No, your death.

562
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,510
No!

563
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,410
What happened, Razia?

564
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,050
What can you be besides terrifying death?

565
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,420
You don't pity poor people.

566
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,400
You don't feel innocent people's pain.

567
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,640
You're not human.
You're a brute. A brute.

568
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,640
What's going on? What happened?

569
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,160
What are you looking at?
Tell me. Where's my husband?

570
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,160
Razia, come to your senses.

571
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,440
My dear, you married me.

572
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,910
Then why did you leave me alone
to wander on the streets?

573
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,640
Tell me. Where will I go now?

574
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,520
Look. I'm without adornments.

575
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,070
I've become destitute.

576
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,570
Tears have washed away my kohl.

577
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:48,640
Call me. Your Razia is calling you.

578
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,780
You won't speak.

579
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,260
I'm imploring you needlessly.

580
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,820
Perhaps God will take pity on me.

581
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,850
But no. Why would he take pity?

582
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,410
He enjoys being capricious.

583
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,900
He laughs when people cry.

584
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,500
No.

585
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,680
God, forgive me.

586
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,850
Your will is acceptable to me.

587
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,690
Razia.

588
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:32,910
Your tears, your pleas are
of no use to the dead.

589
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:39,720
In fact, your tears will hurt his soul.

590
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,040
What do I do? My heart doesn't agree.

591
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,840
I couldn't serve him.

592
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,336
That's what I regret.

593
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,370
You can't cry over this grief, Razia.

594
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,770
If you want the deceased's
soul to rest in peace...

595
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,380
fulfill his wish.

596
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,560
- Wish?
- Yes.

597
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:03,600
Turn sorrow into happiness.

598
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,880
Instead of crying, learn to laugh.

599
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,640
If he liked you as a married woman...

600
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,860
- then live like a married woman.
- Sadiq.

601
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,820
It's what Nazir wanted.

602
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,220
You should give me
the same place he had.

603
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,740
I'm ready to support you.

604
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,640
For God's sake, Sadiq.

605
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,490
Bury your dirty intentions
in this graveyard.

606
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,080
He was my friend.

607
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,220
That's why I have to hold his remembrance
close to my heart.

608
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,670
I'll have to support his widow.

609
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,620
If you want to support me,
support me as your sister.

610
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,780
So that you make a name for yourself.

611
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,680
I've earned as much fame as I want.

612
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,080
Now I'll fulfill my goal.

613
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,960
It will be fulfilled
when you will become mine.

614
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:00,070
- Leave me, scoundrel.
- I always get what I want.

615
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,820
Sadiq.

616
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,580
Learn a lesson.

617
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,330
You're misbehaving with an innocent widow
in the graveyard.

618
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,510
Her husband died recently.

619
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,870
This is what I also want.

620
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,550
This poor woman should not remain a widow.

621
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,000
Why don't you say...

622
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:28,220
that you want to lay the foundation
of marriage on your friend's body.

623
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,690
Mister, why are you
trying to intimidate me?

624
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,080
Because of your father's favors
today Nazir is dead.

625
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,820
Death doesn't need an excuse.

626
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,260
There's love in an elder's scolding too.

627
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,260
Why do you view my love with hatred?

628
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,240
I want to marry my friend's widow
and give her love.

629
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,140
Sadiq.

630
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,040
Under the pretext of friendship
you want to satiate your lust...

631
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,296
for a miserable and unfortunate woman.

632
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,180
- Don't you feel ashamed?
- Aslam, don't try to argue with me.

633
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,940
Or else you'll die young.

634
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,040
It's the duty of youths
to help the weak.

635
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,736
You won't get Razia
as long as I'm alive.

636
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,110
Fine. I'll see your power too.

637
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,840
May I come in?

638
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,100
Silence is also a kind of permission.

639
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:03,330
I see. You seem angry.

640
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:05,830
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

641
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,150
If it's nothing,
why are you angry?

642
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,620
Why are you irritating me?

643
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,260
I'm just asking you
where you're coming from.

644
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,910
- From the graveyard.
- May God protect you.

645
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,470
Why do you go
to the graveyard every day?

646
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,600
To find the sign of my grave.

647
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,330
God forbid.

648
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:35,350
Aslam, I notice that
from the time Nazir died...

649
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:37,250
you've changed a lot.

650
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,800
Because I'm grieving his death.

651
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,280
Razia should be the one
to grieve his death.

652
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,700
But you're more miserable than she.

653
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,280
It's none of your business.

654
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:56,380
Why not? I know your woe
isn't because of Nazir's death...

655
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,530
but because of Razia's love.

656
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:04,240
The love that was doused
when Nazir got married...

657
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,360
is igniting once again.

658
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,360
So that you can kill my desire.

659
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,240
Love is the same
that was before.

660
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,550
Because I've loved Razia since childhood.

661
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,740
And I will always love her.

662
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:27,870
Aslam, today you have killed my desires.

663
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:34,820
You've killed my desire
of marrying you.

664
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:40,620
Now, you tell me.
How will I face the villagers?

665
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:44,920
They think I'm going to marry you.

666
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:24,250
I love only you

667
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:28,810
You love strangers

668
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:43,890
My heart wondered
if you were treacherous

669
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:49,200
You are treacherous

670
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:54,180
I love only you

671
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,960
It's the game of destiny

672
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,270
It's the union of troubles

673
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,500
My heart is aching

674
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:27,730
You are my comfort

675
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,120
I love only you

676
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:54,080
It's futile to cry

677
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:04,440
In the end you have to perish

678
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,210
I am smoldering

679
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:19,460
You are a gust of wind

680
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:29,360
I love only you

681
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:52,010
The one who broke my heart...

682
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:01,980
hear this before you go

683
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:07,250
My husband got fed up of your demands
and he died.

684
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,610
I'll live to repay every penny.

685
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,220
Even if I have to beg.

686
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,080
I'm sorry, dear.

687
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,340
No. I don't want to be the daughter
of such a man...

688
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,420
that conducts poor boys and girls'
marriages in order to earn fame.

689
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,840
And then quietly backstabs them
and kills them.

690
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,500
Razia, you didn't recognize me.

691
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,700
Who doesn't know landlords that step
on poor people's bodies to stand tall?

692
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,330
They give false assurances.

693
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,860
When their work is done,
they shower their wrath.

694
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,890
For God's sake don't call me that.

695
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:49,400
Why not? You are a proud rich man
who ruined my family.

696
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:52,070
My husband died because of you.

697
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:58,120
And today, because of you
I'm waiting for my death.

698
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,150
Razia, your grief has driven you mad.

699
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:07,130
The villagers turned my grief into anger.

700
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,890
The villagers are illiterates.
They think I'm mad.

701
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,600
To ruin the sapling I planted.

702
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,980
- Uncle.
- Razia, you're my daughter.

703
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,990
That's why your anger
is also dear to me.

704
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:28,240
Razia, with God and his messenger
as the witnesses...

705
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,780
I'm telling you I've
cancelled Nazir's debt.

706
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,540
So that his soul rests in peace.

707
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,040
From today this old man
will consider it his duty...

708
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,790
to fulfill your needs.

709
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,520
Don't embarrass me so much.
You're my sole support.

710
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,510
Make God your supporter, dear.

711
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,320
I'm only his unworthy devotee.

712
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:53,890
You are the lord of my heart...

713
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:02,650
a part of my soul

714
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,990
You control everything

715
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:26,510
By your will the garden flourishes

716
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:45,680
You show the light in storms

717
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,460
If you want,
you can turn a life barren

718
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:24,230
If you want, you can bring
happiness to life

719
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,730
May I come in?

720
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,350
Come.

721
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,860
Sit.

722
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,600
What brings you here?

723
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:53,630
I deeply regret I'm alive even
after seeing you in this condition.

724
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,060
And I can't even help you in this grief.

725
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,530
Grief has become my destiny.

726
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:02,970
It's true.

727
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,280
We used to play together in childhood.

728
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,010
So we should share our sorrow too.

729
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:11,430
God forbid. What sorrow do you have?

730
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,420
Don't ask, Razia.

731
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,940
I finished my education and
left the city with high hopes.

732
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,630
Like a bird that tries
to fly faster than the wind...

733
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:29,630
to reach its nest.

734
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,200
But when I came here, I found out...

735
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,520
my world had been destroyed.

736
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:39,720
And my father was responsible for it.

737
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,400
Don't say that.

738
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:46,600
Your father wanted to build
a palace for his capable son.

739
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:50,720
If a poor girl's hut had remained there...

740
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,420
it would have been an eyesore.

741
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:59,040
Razia, I wasn't here then.

742
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,300
You also didn't tell him
not to ruin our lives.

743
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,730
And that you're Aslam's childhood love.

744
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,780
Decent girls don't speak.

745
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:13,510
They simply shed tears.

746
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:18,490
If the person understands,
it's her good fortune.

747
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,860
Or else grief becomes her fate.

748
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,190
No, Razia. Come and stay in my house.

749
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,480
Or else you'll suffocate and die.

750
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,320
- This is my last wish.
- No.

751
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:35,830
That rogue Sadiq is after your honor
thinking you're an orphan.

752
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,870
How can anyone snatch
God's belongings from someone?

753
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:46,990
It's my duty to take you home
and protect you from that devil.

754
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,410
No. That's not your house.
It's Salma's house.

755
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,040
It's inauspicious for
an unfortunate widow...

756
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:00,250
to live in a married woman's house.

757
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,410
This is an illiterate women's superstition.

758
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,100
Salma is educated.

759
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,240
And this is what I expect from her.

760
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,210
She'll never let illiteracy
hinder her duty.

761
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,160
So you can come and live
in my house without worry.

762
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:19,870
I swear on God, Razia.

763
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:22,260
I'm not saying this
because of my love.

764
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:25,830
But my duty as a human being
compels me...

765
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:28,390
to support a hapless woman.

766
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,700
For God's sake
don't worry about my grief.

767
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,600
I know you're an innocent girl's hope...

768
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,270
and an influential family's son.

769
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,260
May God keep you happy!

770
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,830
Go and fulfill your father's wishes.

771
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,230
But how is that possible?

772
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,190
There's mourning in one house...

773
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:52,990
and a marriage celebration in another?

774
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,890
Humans can't change
misfortune into fortune.

775
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,840
I've lost everything.

776
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:02,060
Happiness, husband, solace and peace.

777
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,440
For God's sake leave.

778
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:07,240
I'm scared of everything.

779
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:09,920
Okay, Razia, I'll leave.

780
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,750
But you're under my oath.

781
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:17,020
Make yourself strong and
try to walk on God's path.

782
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,000
This too shall pass. Goodbye.

783
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,260
Oh Lord.

784
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,830
Give my broken heart so much strength...

785
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:41,980
that I can walk on the path shown by you...

786
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:45,430
and become a noble woman.

787
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:47,860
May God grant integrity!

788
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:50,056
This is the first time I've heard
of a haunting spirit.

789
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,680
I've never heard of it before.

790
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,670
Why won't his spirit wander?
He died unexpectedly.

791
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,650
This is how a decent man should be.
He lost his life.

792
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,990
But what's the use
of wandering in the village?

793
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,160
Sadiq used to say
he loved Razia a lot.

794
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,980
May God grant integrity!

795
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,150
My wife also loved me a lot.
But her soul never visited me.

796
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,430
And he's not leaving her
even after dying.

797
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,410
Don't say that, Kalu.

798
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:18,540
- If he comes, it will be terrible.
- Yes, he's right.

799
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:19,750
Really?

800
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:25,630
Stay awake!

801
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:58,460
Oh heart, who shall I tell
about your grief?

802
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:20,220
The world is heartless

803
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,230
People are cruel

804
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:43,560
Oh heart, who shall I tell
about your grief?

805
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:55,240
The world of my love
didn't last for even two days

806
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:04,060
I wonder who cast an evil eye
on my love?

807
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:13,240
All my desires remained unfulfilled

808
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:22,140
What kind of flame burned my love?

809
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:32,180
My love had not reached its peak

810
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:50,450
Oh heart, who shall I tell
about your grief?

811
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:03,480
Why do the moon and the stars
hiccup at my plight?

812
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:15,870
My eyes are filled with tears

813
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:24,760
Why does love burst into flames?

814
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:33,680
Perhaps with the aid of love
you forget everything

815
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:43,330
I will spend my youth crying

816
01:06:53,660 --> 01:07:01,660
Oh heart, who shall I tell
about your grief?

817
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:23,790
Ghost!

818
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,180
Look. Nazir's ghost.

819
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,550
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!

820
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,060
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!

821
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:56,370
Razia.

822
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:00,950
Razia.

823
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,030
Recognize me. I'm not a ghost.

824
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,270
I'm your husband.

825
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:19,620
I'm unfortunate Nazir,
the cure for your loneliness.

826
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:25,000
Recognize me. Feel me, Razia.

827
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:28,020
Put your hand on my heart and see.

828
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,740
Your name is in each
of my heartbeats.

829
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:37,509
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!

830
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,630
I don't understand how the ghost
carried her away.

831
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,830
But we can't deny what
all the villagers are saying, son.

832
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:30,210
Where are you taking me?

833
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:33,730
Nowhere, dear. You're home.

834
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,800
And where is he?

835
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:42,809
- Dear, you were dreaming.
- Dreaming?

836
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:47,190
Father, I don't think it right
to leave her alone.

837
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,989
Of course. It's our duty
to protect her.

838
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,970
Come, dear. Come and stay
in our house.

839
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:57,400
No, uncle. I won't leave this house.

840
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:03,810
Uncle, don't trouble her
so late at night.

841
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:05,880
Today I'll sleep here.

842
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:09,360
This is also fine.
Okay, dear. We'll leave.

843
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:11,630
Today your sister will stay here.

844
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:14,360
Come, Aslam. Let Razia rest.

845
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,490
Salma, it was him. Absolutely him.

846
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:25,970
I can swear.

847
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,320
It can be possible, sister. Now you won't
have to stay in this house.

848
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:32,970
I'm not even dying.

849
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,580
So that I get rid of this barren house.

850
01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:41,590
God forbid. This beautiful
face wasn't made...

851
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:44,100
for it to die before its time.

852
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:49,390
One day I'll die crying.

853
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:52,020
May your enemies die!

854
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:56,420
Sister, if you don't mind,
may I say something?

855
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:58,030
What?

856
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,620
It's very difficult
for a woman to stay alone.

857
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:09,090
So I suggest you better get married.

858
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,860
Salma. Don't say such things.

859
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,350
Don't you know?

860
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,190
By wasting your youth like this...

861
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:20,500
you'll become God
and the prophet's culprit.

862
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:24,040
No, Salma. I know.

863
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,340
You marry only once.

864
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:30,760
You cannot marry again.

865
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,630
If you're young, you can marry.

866
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:44,720
Because I know a boy who is fighting
and struggling for you.

867
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:48,830
Salma, what are you saying?

868
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:53,870
It's not time to tell you.
Because I haven't decided yet.

869
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,090
Which is greater? Love or duty?

870
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,450
- Salma, listen.
- I've heard.

871
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:03,660
Now it's time to do something.

872
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:16,130
Salma, are you trying
to rub salt in my wounds?

873
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,230
Not at all.
I've brought salve for you.

874
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:24,700
- Salve?
- Yes.

875
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:28,150
I won't be able to keep you happy.

876
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:34,520
Your broken heart
will always call out to Razia.

877
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,260
But I won't let my voice
reach to my lips.

878
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,190
That's so you don't feel bad.

879
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:45,770
No, Aslam. My duty is compelling me...

880
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:50,680
not to be a barrier between you and Razia.

881
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,120
That's why I'm insisting...

882
01:12:55,300 --> 01:13:02,820
you go and tell your father
to give Razia back to you.

883
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:07,850
Salma, how can you say that?

884
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:15,230
If I marry Razia, father's wishes
and your life will be ruined.

885
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:23,340
This orphan's life had never flourished
that it will now be ruined.

886
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:27,540
Aslam, you are under Razia's oath.

887
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:29,950
Support that hapless woman.

888
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:33,260
She has nobody besides you in the world.

889
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:36,230
Salma, have you gone crazy?

890
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,030
You want to dig your own grave.

891
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,300
Don't worry about me.

892
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,060
I have uncle as my guardian.

893
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,220
I can see you and spend my life.

894
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:55,820
But people's taunts won't
let that poor hapless Razia live.

895
01:13:58,020 --> 01:13:59,120
Aslam...

896
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:02,680
it's my first and last plea.

897
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:06,010
Marry Razia.

898
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:09,710
Go.

899
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,990
Get your father's permission.

900
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,050
Go.

901
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,920
Arrange her marriage to someone.

902
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,910
If you have a good friend, tell him.

903
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:29,190
There is no flaw in the girl.
She's beautiful, talented and brave.

904
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:34,060
In today's world
no man will marry a widow...

905
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:37,000
regardless of how good she is.

906
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:40,810
- Then?
- When there is no flaw in her...

907
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,680
why don't you bring her to your house?

908
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,230
What do you mean?

909
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,350
Don't you feel ashamed
to talk to your father like that?

910
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,870
You want me to make a widow
of my daughter-in-law?

911
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,450
And throw this hapless girl out...

912
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,480
whom I have raised to be your wife.

913
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:59,670
No, father.

914
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,160
Salma is unmarried.

915
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,920
She has you.
She can marry the best man.

916
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:12,180
But who will accept widow Razia?

917
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,970
You're young and emotional.

918
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:16,670
I've seen the world.

919
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:19,410
I can see a person's eyes
and read his heart.

920
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:22,470
I have raised Salma.
I can feel her pain.

921
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:24,470
I know her desires.

922
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:26,830
She'll be ruined after losing you.

923
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,600
I won't see her being ruined.

924
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,990
You can't see Salma's devastation.

925
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,900
But you can see your son's devastation.

926
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:37,140
You don't even know
how you have destroyed me...

927
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:40,500
by getting Razia married to Nazir.

928
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,250
I've seen my desires being crushed.

929
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:47,130
I suppressed the pain of my love.
And you didn't find out...

930
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:49,760
- because your vision is clouded.
- Aslam!

931
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:53,350
Get lost! Go away!

932
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:10,410
Father, if young people's desires
get the aid of elders...

933
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,720
they can change the world.

934
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:17,460
From among widows and unmarried girls,
widows should be chosen...

935
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,450
so that people realize their mistake.

936
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:22,220
It's not the question of one Razia.

937
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,320
But it's a question
of countless girls like Razia...

938
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:30,400
who are widows and leading miserable lives.

939
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:37,140
I want to follow humanity and show
the right path to the world.

940
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:40,490
Because I know...

941
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:49,510
a father's loving heart will make
every sacrifice for his son.

942
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,910
Salma, don't cry. Rest assured...

943
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,760
I won't let Aslam ruin your life.

944
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:08,140
You won't have any sorrow
as long as I'm here.

945
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:10,420
No, uncle.

946
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:18,580
For a brother's happiness a sister's tears
are appealing to you...

947
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:23,430
to make Razia your daughter-in-law.

948
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:31,430
Because brother Aslam
has loved Razia since childhood.

949
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,200
Oh Lord.

950
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:43,570
Forgive this culprit's sins.

951
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,280
Protect me from evil.

952
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:48,720
Shower goodness on me.

953
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:53,960
And grant peace to the soul of the dead.

954
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,960
- Amen.
- The Almighty...

955
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,720
can grant solace to restless souls.

956
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:08,600
But it's in your hands to grant peace
to Nazir's soul, Razia.

957
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:12,360
Beware. If you're not afraid
of a human's power...

958
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,260
at least fear God's wrath.

959
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,300
It's wrong to say such things.

960
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,350
Whether you think I'm
an atheist or a Muslim...

961
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:23,810
but I'll say this sincerely.

962
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,530
Unless you marry again, Razia...

963
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,510
neither the deceased's soul
can rest in peace...

964
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:33,230
nor can your heart find peace.

965
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,080
That's why our community
permits second marriages.

966
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,310
Our community permits second marriages.

967
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:46,370
But it doesn't compel anyone.

968
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,110
It depends on an individual's wish.

969
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:50,870
What's your intention?

970
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,020
I intend to spend my life
in God's service

971
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:06,020
You're young and can't spend
your whole life like that, Razia.

972
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:11,300
And a woman's intention
is weaker than a thread.

973
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:13,450
You'll have to marry again.

974
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,880
That too to me.
This is my final decision.

975
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:20,310
Oh Lord! Your decision
isn't God's decision...

976
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,940
that I should bow before you.

977
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:24,570
Many great people have bowed
before me, Razia.

978
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,100
Who are you?

979
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,406
Listen to me carefully.

980
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,950
If you want to live
decently, remember this.

981
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:34,430
Razia, you should always
rebuff such a devil.

982
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:35,730
Salma.

983
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:39,186
Leave here!

984
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:41,260
You come to a stranger's house
and harass a widow?

985
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:42,990
Don't you feel ashamed?

986
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:45,980
Salma, don't argue with him.

987
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:48,900
Tell him to leave politely.

988
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:51,860
Or else I'll gather people
and have him beaten.

989
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,090
Quiet.

990
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:58,090
Look, I am saying again.
Leave quietly. Or else...

991
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:01,890
- You'll scream and gather people?
- Yes.

992
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:04,450
Fine.

993
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:06,870
I'm leaving.

994
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:10,990
But remember. You got in Sadiq's way.

995
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:20,500
Salma, why did you scold him like that?

996
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,950
He's very dangerous.

997
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:28,000
Sister, grief has made you weak.

998
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,440
These men deserve
to be spoken to like that.

999
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:35,070
Who do I have now...

1000
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,910
to stop this nuisance?

1001
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,560
Why not, sister?

1002
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,750
Aslam is eager to fulfill this duty.

1003
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:49,000
Salma, what are you saying?

1004
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,990
I'm speaking the truth, sister.

1005
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:53,950
Aslam is yours.

1006
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:56,320
And he'll always be yours.

1007
01:20:57,210 --> 01:21:00,820
No, Salma. For God's sake
don't say such things...

1008
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,080
that will make me cry.

1009
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,370
The time of crying is gone.

1010
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:13,310
Now I'm waiting for the day
when I'll dress you as a bride.

1011
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:17,550
No, Salma. I can't buy
happiness for myself...

1012
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:20,350
at the cost of your happiness.

1013
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,720
Aslam is yours.

1014
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:33,820
But I can't look after him the way
you can look after him.

1015
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,990
I've studied both of you.

1016
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:41,770
I've overheard your conversations.

1017
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:44,470
Salma, forgive me.

1018
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:46,970
I'll never open my mouth again.

1019
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:50,270
- Even if you suffocate and die?
- Yes.

1020
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:52,670
This is what I don't want.

1021
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:58,050
Because of me two youths
will always face hardships.

1022
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:02,750
Here. From today you hold this.

1023
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:08,260
No, Salma. I can't kill your desires.

1024
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:12,350
I swear on God, sister.
If you don't agree...

1025
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:14,670
I'll kill myself.

1026
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,130
Salma, what are you saying?

1027
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:20,750
If I marry Aslam despite knowing this...

1028
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:25,910
not just everyone else,
but I'll abhor myself, too.

1029
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:29,010
Salma, listen.

1030
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:30,510
Salma.

1031
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:45,190
Salma.

1032
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:49,550
Leave me.

1033
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:55,350
Your voice can't escape
from this room.

1034
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:10,850
Remember...

1035
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:14,710
the end for those who betray
their friends is very bad, Sadiq.

1036
01:23:34,950 --> 01:23:36,050
Salma.

1037
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:38,290
Wait.

1038
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:50,710
Now do you see the result
of interfering with Sadiq?

1039
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:55,010
Sadiq.

1040
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:58,920
You've done me a great favor.

1041
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:07,260
Or else I would have had
to live with a heavy heart.

1042
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:08,750
I'm happy.

1043
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,830
You'll also become
an unfortunate one like me.

1044
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:22,100
Razia will marry Aslam.

1045
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:27,500
I've made all the arrangements.

1046
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:33,700
Now your evil hands
won't reach to her.

1047
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,390
Sister. Sister.

1048
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:41,320
Forgive me.

1049
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:46,750
Till now I was feigning ignorance...

1050
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:54,710
and being a barrier
between you and Aslam.

1051
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:58,450
Aslam.

1052
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:02,810
Run! Run!

1053
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,070
- It's terrible! It's terrible!
- What happened?

1054
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:08,400
- There are two corpses in my house.
- Two corpses?

1055
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:13,830
Yes. Nazir's ghost has
killed Salma and Mehmood.

1056
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:17,590
- Murdered them?
- Yes, I wonder how I escaped.

1057
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,360
That's strange.

1058
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:23,306
Mr. Chaudhary, Nazir's ghost
has killed Salma.

1059
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:24,830
- What did you say?
- What?

1060
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:27,390
- It's a lie. A lie.
- Not a lie, Mr. Chaudhary.

1061
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:29,050
The entire village agrees.

1062
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:33,240
If Razia stays in the village,
the entire village will be destroyed.

1063
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:36,350
- Oh Lord!
- I don't believe this.

1064
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:38,530
I'll find out the truth.

1065
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:41,100
Throw Razia out of the village!

1066
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:43,310
So that Nazir's ghost
never haunts the village again.

1067
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,480
Razia is certainly
the bearer of bad tidings.

1068
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,350
Throw her out of the village.

1069
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:50,460
Yes, sir. Throw her out.

1070
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:52,590
We should put pressure on Chaudhary.

1071
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:56,440
The villagers' lives are more precious
than Razia's life.

1072
01:25:57,070 --> 01:26:00,410
Sadiq was saying that Nazir's ghost
is haunting the village.

1073
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,360
And it killed Salma.

1074
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:07,450
Oh Lord! Give peace
to that haunting soul.

1075
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:10,430
But how had Salma harmed him?

1076
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:13,870
Oh Lord! What's happening?

1077
01:26:14,550 --> 01:26:20,150
Throw Razia out of the village!

1078
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:39,250
Aslam.

1079
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,360
Listen, son.

1080
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:47,900
Throw Razia out of the village!

1081
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,640
Razia won't be thrown
out of the village.

1082
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:52,760
We don't want to talk to you.

1083
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:54,590
Call Mr. Chaudhary.

1084
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,420
Aslam is right.

1085
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:59,030
Will the villagers lose
their lives like that?

1086
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,730
If Nazir's ghost is killing people...

1087
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:03,940
how is that Razia's fault?

1088
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:07,430
Mr. Chaudhary, the other day you saw...

1089
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:10,070
Nazir's ghost carry Razia away.

1090
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:14,390
If he had succeeded, he wouldn't
have come to the village again.

1091
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:17,440
Can you take the responsibility?

1092
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:20,300
Aren't you sad about Salma's murder?

1093
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:23,870
Who doesn't feel sad
at his child's death?

1094
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:26,790
I had pinned my hopes on Salma.

1095
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:30,100
God knows better.
That's why she died.

1096
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:33,840
Mr. Chaudhary, these things hold true...

1097
01:27:34,410 --> 01:27:36,390
unless tragedy strikes your family.

1098
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,430
If this had happened with Aslam...

1099
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,350
it would have opened your eyes.

1100
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,826
Absolutely true.

1101
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:46,160
- Won't you throw Razia out of the village?
- No.

1102
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:48,150
You'll have to throw her out.

1103
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:51,140
Who has the courage
to throw Razia out of the village?

1104
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:53,230
I say leave.

1105
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:55,540
Do whatever you want.

1106
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:00,930
Razia is under my care.

1107
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:03,280
Fine. We'll see.

1108
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:14,120
Razia, where are you going?

1109
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,250
- Wherever fate takes me.
- But why?

1110
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:22,020
If this is what the villagers want,
I can't stay here either.

1111
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:26,510
No, Razia. I can't leave you
alone like that.

1112
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:29,110
Shame on such an influential Chaudhary...

1113
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,360
who can't even give shelter to a widow.

1114
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,090
Come, dear. Stay in my house.

1115
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:40,470
When I'm destined to be homeless,
what can you do?

1116
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:46,340
No, dear. I have ruined your life.

1117
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:48,210
I'll have to fix it.

1118
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,130
I've come to beg to you, dear.

1119
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:53,820
Light up my bleak house, dear.

1120
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:57,230
No, uncle. I am unlucky.

1121
01:28:57,740 --> 01:28:59,830
I lost my parents in childhood.

1122
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:05,600
- In youth I lost my husband.
- Don't say that.

1123
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,960
It's all God's will.

1124
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:14,210
Please agree.

1125
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:17,330
Aslam also loves you.

1126
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:21,720
- Uncle.
- Dear, heed this old man.

1127
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:25,980
I don't want to hear anything but yes.

1128
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:29,710
Fulfill poor Salma's last wish.

1129
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:34,340
She lost her life in the desire
of seeing both of you married.

1130
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,110
But I'm afraid of my fate.

1131
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:45,330
Those who walk on the path of God
should never fear anyone.

1132
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:49,170
It's the will of God, dear.
Just say yes.

1133
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,570
- Uncle.
- Bless you, dear.

1134
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:57,640
You heeded me. God bless you.

1135
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:02,820
My heart is wounded and broken.
Give it solace.

1136
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:18,750
Ansari, why is there lightning today?

1137
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,870
Why did it hide?

1138
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:24,470
Tell me.

1139
01:30:25,010 --> 01:30:28,400
Yes. Oh prophet, it's Friday night.

1140
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:32,030
The girl is inside. And I am outside.

1141
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:48,300
Why? Why did you come
inside without permission?

1142
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,740
Oh, my God!

1143
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:55,950
Does one need permission
to come to one's house?

1144
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,170
You should have at least knocked.

1145
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:03,550
What is this?
In earlier times people used to knock.

1146
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:07,910
But nowadays people sing and enter.

1147
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:10,510
Oh, my God!

1148
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:12,470
Tell me. What do you want?

1149
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:18,850
I want what you want.

1150
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:24,870
Oh my innocent heart,
I am what you are.

1151
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:30,820
I used to think you were a man.
Are you also a woman?

1152
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:35,430
Oh, my God! Banno, it's not that.

1153
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:38,900
In fact, like you people,
I'm also a barber.

1154
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:50,630
May God grant integrity, Ansari!

1155
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:53,480
Are you really our sibling?

1156
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:59,230
Here, take the hookah.

1157
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,600
- Yes, Kalu.
- Yes.

1158
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:08,710
The only difference
between you and me is that...

1159
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:13,860
you're a traditional barber,
and I'm a modern barber.

1160
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:17,280
I swear on you, Kalu.

1161
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:22,520
In Mumbai I have shaved many
rich and wealthy people's beards.

1162
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:24,790
May God grant integrity, Ansari!

1163
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:28,140
If you had told me before
that you're a barber...

1164
01:32:28,970 --> 01:32:32,940
by now I would have
got Banno married to you.

1165
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,030
Better late than never.

1166
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:36,470
Oh, my God!

1167
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:37,926
- Kalu.
- Yes.

1168
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:40,670
Make arrangements for the marriage.
I'll also start the arrangements.

1169
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,180
Come on.

1170
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:45,660
- Bye.
- Bye.

1171
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:47,740
- Bye.
- May God grant integrity!

1172
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:56,590
Ansari, today something
significant happened.

1173
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:58,550
That's why I brought you here.

1174
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:01,050
Oh, my God! What's the matter?

1175
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,360
I'm telling the truth, Ansari.

1176
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:05,710
Aslam's marriage to Razia
has been arranged.

1177
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,376
It'll be tomorrow.

1178
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,060
- Razia's marriage?
- Yes.

1179
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,710
Oh, my God! What are you saying?

1180
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:15,200
My wife is getting remarried
while I'm alive.

1181
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:18,300
This can't happen.

1182
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:22,710
Razia, I will certainly save you.

1183
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:25,230
I'll save you, Razia!

1184
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:44,160
- I see you.
- Wherever I look

1185
01:33:44,510 --> 01:33:49,590
- I see you here.
- I see you there

1186
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:13,630
The stars peep at you

1187
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:34,460
Fireflies gesture to you

1188
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,770
Just lift your eyes

1189
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:08,950
Scenarios are looking at you

1190
01:35:21,790 --> 01:35:27,090
My eyes look for you all the time

1191
01:35:32,710 --> 01:35:37,590
May nobody cast an evil eye on you!

1192
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:51,150
- I see you.
- Wherever I look

1193
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:56,810
- I see you here.
- I see you there

1194
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:15,200
The saga of your name
dwells in my eyes

1195
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:40,150
Life has started changing

1196
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:57,910
I am shedding tears of joy

1197
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:13,450
There's a smile on my lips
and tears in my eyes

1198
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:32,390
My eyes are downcast out of modesty

1199
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:43,450
When I lift my eyes
and look around...

1200
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:54,230
- I see you.
- Wherever I look

1201
01:37:54,330 --> 01:38:00,050
- I see you here.
- I see you there

1202
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:05,850
Come on, girls. Dinner is ready.
Bring the bride along too.

1203
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,590
Come on. You guys have dinner.
Come, Aslam. You come too.

1204
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:17,710
Come on. Let's have dinner.

1205
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:31,690
Father!

1206
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:33,470
Why did Aslam scream?

1207
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:36,580
- Someone has killed Aslam.
- Aslam?

1208
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:42,620
Mr. Chaudhary, Aslam's been murdered.

1209
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:44,060
What happened?

1210
01:38:50,950 --> 01:38:54,880
- What happened? Move.
- My Aslam. My son.

1211
01:38:57,970 --> 01:38:59,070
Aslam.

1212
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,750
What happened, son?

1213
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:07,680
Who couldn't see your youth?

1214
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:13,550
For God's sake, fetch
a doctor from the city.

1215
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:17,660
My lifelong wealth is being snatched.

1216
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:23,670
My son. My chest is bursting.

1217
01:39:24,230 --> 01:39:25,530
Give me assurance.

1218
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:32,010
Father.

1219
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:38,370
Razia.

1220
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:41,790
Razia. Razia. Come.

1221
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:47,710
Your groom is calling you.

1222
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:52,400
My son wanted to marry you.

1223
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:07,800
Razia, see how your groom is bloodied.

1224
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:10,790
Aslam, your Razia is here.

1225
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:12,610
Open your eyes, son.

1226
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,770
For God's sake,
don't leave your father.

1227
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:19,230
Hold this old man, son.

1228
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:24,240
Have patience, Mr. Chaudhary.

1229
01:40:26,570 --> 01:40:30,990
My young son is dying.
And I should have patience?

1230
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:35,790
Father.

1231
01:40:55,810 --> 01:41:00,880
No. I will be ruined.
I will be destroyed.

1232
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:02,590
Have mercy on me.

1233
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,350
Aslam, pity my old age.

1234
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,280
Be strong, Mr. Chaudhary.

1235
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:14,470
This is how long
he was destined to live.

1236
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:22,500
No, heartless one.
Don't take my son away from me.

1237
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,510
Aslam, don't leave me.

1238
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,030
Take me along with you, too.

1239
01:41:31,070 --> 01:41:34,410
I'll fulfill your needs
over there too.

1240
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:38,360
You aren't heeding this old man.

1241
01:41:41,130 --> 01:41:43,360
Pity your bride.

1242
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,760
You were paving a new way
for the world.

1243
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:52,230
Get up. The world has come to you.

1244
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:54,010
And you aren't even looking.

1245
01:41:54,660 --> 01:42:00,170
Son, what did I do
that you're angry with me?

1246
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:01,630
Mr. Chaudhary.

1247
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:05,170
God, forgive me.

1248
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:08,730
My son's death has driven me crazy.

1249
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:11,230
Grant me patience.

1250
01:42:11,970 --> 01:42:16,270
My Lord, I'm sending
what belonged to you...

1251
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:18,700
with trembling hands.

1252
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:21,340
Accept it.

1253
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:28,460
Ansari. Ansari.

1254
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,256
Nazir's ghost is going there.

1255
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:33,340
Beat him. Beat him. Beat him.

1256
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:18,140
No, I'm still a married woman.

1257
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:23,130
Aslam, come.

1258
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:26,860
This flowery bed is waiting for you.

1259
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:34,910
Salma, forgive me.

1260
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:39,230
I couldn't safeguard what belonged to you.

1261
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:45,350
I congratulate you with tears in my eyes.

1262
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:48,710
Your groom has come to you.

1263
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:54,430
Wait. I'll also come to you.

1264
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:10,360
Hocus pocus. Do away with the evil spirit.

1265
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:30,666
Hey! Oh, my God! Kalu,
what's going on?

1266
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:31,886
Ansari, you?

1267
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:34,376
May God grant integrity!
She's been possessed by a spirit!

1268
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,720
Oh, my God!

1269
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:40,420
I'm also possessed by love.

1270
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:46,250
But Nazir has possessed her.

1271
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:51,260
I see. So Nazir
has started troubling us too.

1272
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:53,140
May God grant integrity, Ansari!

1273
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:57,280
Just spread the holy smoke.
I'll fetch a talisman from the priest.

1274
01:44:57,670 --> 01:44:59,780
- Yes, Kalu. Go quickly.
- Yes.

1275
01:44:59,950 --> 01:45:02,000
- We should get rid of one spirit at least.
- Yes.

1276
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:05,130
May God grant integrity, Ansari!

1277
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:09,356
Don't stop. Spread the holy smoke
until I return.

1278
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:11,460
Yes, Kalu. Go. Don't worry.

1279
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:20,770
Well done, Banno.

1280
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:22,700
If you hadn't played this charade...

1281
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,550
Kalu would never have
left me alone with you.

1282
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:32,800
Stop it, Banno. I'm not Kalu
to get duped by you.

1283
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:35,130
I know that Nazir is alive.

1284
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:37,270
How can his spirit come here?

1285
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:44,340
Oh, my God! What have I revealed?

1286
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:47,520
Banno, Nazir is a ghost.

1287
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:55,440
I see. So it's your mischief.

1288
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:57,630
I'll devour you.

1289
01:45:57,750 --> 01:46:02,340
No, Nazir. It's not my fault.
It's Sadiq's doing.

1290
01:46:02,650 --> 01:46:04,350
You're lying.

1291
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:08,950
Nazir, I swear on Banno.
I am speaking the truth.

1292
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:11,390
Sadiq was in love with Razia.

1293
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:14,700
So he hired Mehmood to kill you.

1294
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:18,010
- You're also his friend. Rogue!
- Oh my!

1295
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:24,730
Nazir, I swear on Banno.

1296
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:29,230
I'll end my friendship with Sadiq.
Here. I'm holding my ears.

1297
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:32,930
You're holding your ears.
But you killed Aslam and Salma.

1298
01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:36,650
What are you saying, Nazir?
Sadiq killed all of them.

1299
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:40,730
A devil who commits atrocities
on a weak woman? Get out.

1300
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:42,910
I don't even want to see your face.

1301
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:47,210
- Oh, my God! You're Banno.
- I am Banno.

1302
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:50,280
You've confessed your crimes to me.

1303
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,130
You're a devil's associate.

1304
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,190
But I'm telling you
that I feel remorse.

1305
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:59,600
Go and tell Razia who's facing
hardships because of you people.

1306
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:02,290
Go and apologize to her.

1307
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:04,820
Go.

1308
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:07,420
Razia.

1309
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:09,030
You're still alive?

1310
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:13,650
Whichever house you go,
there is mourning.

1311
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:19,250
You're a witch who destroys homes.
You still want to live.

1312
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:22,980
Shame on you and your destiny.

1313
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:26,040
Go. If you have shame,
go and drown.

1314
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:28,830
So that the world is cleansed of you.

1315
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:33,750
Now you'll gain peace
and solace only after dying.

1316
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:35,670
Nowhere else.

1317
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,040
It's true.

1318
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:42,450
Death is better than this life.

1319
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,780
Razia.

1320
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:53,620
Razia.

1321
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:58,930
Leave from here.
The witch might cast her shadow on you.

1322
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:05,310
Oh, my God! She's a beautiful nuisance!

1323
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:07,310
To hell with this nuisance.

1324
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:10,390
She's more dangerous than the plague.

1325
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:11,940
Wretched woman.

1326
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:13,830
I wonder how many people she's killed.

1327
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:16,380
Whose name are you taking?

1328
01:48:16,570 --> 01:48:18,410
After ruining the entire village
she's leaving.

1329
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,090
I spit on your face!

1330
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,860
Razia.

1331
01:48:53,170 --> 01:48:54,270
Razia.

1332
01:48:54,670 --> 01:48:56,720
Razia. Razia, listen.

1333
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:01,980
Razia.

1334
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:07,050
- Razia, where are you going?
- Wherever death takes me.

1335
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:08,910
This can't be.

1336
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:11,840
How have I wronged you people?

1337
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:14,190
You won't even let me die peacefully.

1338
01:49:14,660 --> 01:49:17,820
If I let you die,
how will I face the world?

1339
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:20,470
Razia, forgive me.

1340
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,670
Beware if you hold my hand.

1341
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:26,060
If a brother can't hold his sister's hand,
who else will hold it?

1342
01:49:27,990 --> 01:49:29,550
- Brother?
- Yes.

1343
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:33,300
No. I can't trust you people.

1344
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:36,120
Because you're that devil's associate.

1345
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:38,510
No, Razia.

1346
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:43,710
I curse that devil and I
bow my head before you in shame.

1347
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:48,280
Before now, whatever hardships you faced
were because of Sadiq.

1348
01:49:49,130 --> 01:49:51,190
We ruined you
by remaining his friends.

1349
01:49:51,930 --> 01:49:54,550
But now, I can't see your plight.

1350
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:56,640
Forgive me, sister.

1351
01:49:57,130 --> 01:49:59,350
Go. I forgive you.

1352
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:03,680
But a brother can't leave his sister
to wander the streets.

1353
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:05,580
I promise you.

1354
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:08,120
I will certainly reunite you
with your husband.

1355
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:13,780
- What? He is alive?
- Yes, Nazir lives.

1356
01:50:14,370 --> 01:50:17,120
Trust me. Come with me.

1357
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:29,370
If you're innocent,
then maybe he wants to test you.

1358
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:31,560
Test me?

1359
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,520
You're right, sir.

1360
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:39,700
Perhaps he wants to test whether...

1361
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:45,750
I can save my noble wife
despite being helpless.

1362
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:51,000
I'm going. Pray for me, sir.

1363
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:55,790
Son, I'm a culprit like you.

1364
01:50:56,910 --> 01:50:59,470
Go and pray
at prophet Saiyed's tomb.

1365
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:03,610
He is God's chosen one.
He is his messenger.

1366
01:51:04,850 --> 01:51:07,960
On his saying, God will give you
relief from your hardships.

1367
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:09,840
Haven't you heard?

1368
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:13,310
Destiny changes when
he casts his sight on you.

1369
01:51:22,710 --> 01:51:25,840
The leader of the holy city of Medina

1370
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:29,090
The master of the holy city of Medina

1371
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:42,580
My heart is filled with your love

1372
01:51:49,290 --> 01:51:52,260
The leader of the holy city of Medina

1373
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:59,310
The master of the holy city of Medina

1374
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:12,870
The ocean without any shore

1375
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:22,690
You are my supporter

1376
01:52:26,150 --> 01:52:32,600
Save me from the storm

1377
01:52:39,370 --> 01:52:42,500
The master of the holy city of Medina

1378
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:45,990
The leader of the holy city of Medina

1379
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:10,560
I have nobody besides you

1380
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:21,910
Save me

1381
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:31,660
I'm dying. This isn't called living

1382
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:41,430
The leader of the holy city of Medina

1383
01:53:44,910 --> 01:53:47,880
The master of the holy city of Medina

1384
01:53:54,640 --> 01:54:00,890
My eyes are moist.
My heart is thumping

1385
01:54:01,330 --> 01:54:05,370
The leader of the holy city of Medina

1386
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:21,090
My face is free of scars.

1387
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,080
God, you heard my prayer.

1388
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:34,740
Sadiq.

1389
01:54:35,980 --> 01:54:37,380
What are you doing?

1390
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:41,440
What will you gain
by torturing a hapless woman?

1391
01:54:46,570 --> 01:54:54,570
The woman who has snatched my peace,
slumber and solace.

1392
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:57,100
She's hapless?

1393
01:55:02,290 --> 01:55:06,210
Of course. She is hapless
and chaste too.

1394
01:55:07,410 --> 01:55:10,330
So better forget her.

1395
01:55:13,090 --> 01:55:14,290
Forget her?

1396
01:55:15,170 --> 01:55:17,220
And let my crimes go in vain?

1397
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:23,620
The woman for whom
I betrayed Nazir's friendship?

1398
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,020
I killed Salma.

1399
01:55:26,770 --> 01:55:28,790
I killed Mehmood.

1400
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:33,640
I murdered Aslam and
thus killed Chaudhary's desires.

1401
01:55:34,270 --> 01:55:37,130
I should forget that Razia?
It isn't possible.

1402
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,610
I have destroyed so many lives
for my happiness.

1403
01:55:42,110 --> 01:55:43,640
She'll have to be mine.

1404
01:55:44,110 --> 01:55:47,600
Satan, if you can hear, then hear.

1405
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:52,250
Even your conscience abhors you
and your intentions.

1406
01:55:52,370 --> 01:55:53,470
Quiet!

1407
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:57,350
Sir...

1408
01:55:57,790 --> 01:56:00,470
It's the blood of those
whom you have tortured.

1409
01:56:00,750 --> 01:56:02,650
Now you can't fulfill your wish.

1410
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:06,920
Because, seeing your dirty crimes
I've severed my ties with you.

1411
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:09,760
Ansari, being Sadiq's associate...

1412
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:11,640
you're afraid of the invisible one?

1413
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,460
Beware if you say anything against him.

1414
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:17,840
Go and tell him to try
and stop Sadiq if he can.

1415
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:19,650
Go, get lost.

1416
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:22,430
Sadiq. Sadiq.

1417
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:26,840
Come back. I've told Razia
that Nazir is alive.

1418
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:31,676
Ansari, you have shortened your life
by revealing this secret.

1419
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:34,620
I don't care.
I've regained my lost integrity.

1420
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:36,240
I also curse you.

1421
01:56:36,710 --> 01:56:38,900
First I have to crush Razia's obstinacy.

1422
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:41,470
Razia is not like those weak women.

1423
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:43,150
I know she's a devout wife.

1424
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:46,000
That's why I have
to win her using Nazir.

1425
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:49,996
Fine. I will also have
to get the villagers' help...

1426
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:51,520
to save my sister's honor.

1427
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:55,590
- Wazir, go and inform the police.
- Fine. I'll leave immediately.

1428
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:01,030
- Jhamma.
- Hello.

1429
01:57:03,630 --> 01:57:05,030
Will you support me?

1430
01:57:05,320 --> 01:57:06,920
What are you saying, Mr. Sadiq?

1431
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:09,026
If I don't support you,
where else will I go?

1432
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:12,950
- Fine. You'll have to do my work.
- Tell me.

1433
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:15,240
I'm going to kidnap Razia.

1434
01:57:15,730 --> 01:57:17,226
Stand outside and keep watch.

1435
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:19,660
If Nazir or Ansari or anyone comes
kill him. Got that?

1436
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:22,030
This is what will happen, Mr. Sadiq.

1437
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:41,986
Sadiq!

1438
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,840
Yes. The worshiper of your beauty.

1439
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:48,300
The man crazy for your love.

1440
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:53,480
Razia, see my desires.

1441
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:58,570
I am bloodied and yet
offering you my hand.

1442
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,370
I say lift your hands in atonement.

1443
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:08,000
See how nature is striking lightning...

1444
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,740
to destroy a tyrant like you.

1445
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:18,230
Razia, lightning, thunder and storm...

1446
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:22,010
cannot stop Sadiq's desires.

1447
01:59:22,890 --> 01:59:25,780
It can't come in the way
of Sadiq's immense love.

1448
01:59:28,190 --> 01:59:32,006
You're a devil who is labeling
his lust as love and thus defaming love.

1449
01:59:32,030 --> 01:59:34,640
Razia, till now you've reciprocated...

1450
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:37,840
my love and wishes with hatred.

1451
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:39,480
But remember.

1452
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:43,530
Today I'll ensure that
my desires come true.

1453
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:47,750
But Razia will be dead by then.

1454
01:59:48,250 --> 01:59:50,420
She'll leave her body
and her life.

1455
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:55,550
Let me see you escape
from my clutches now.

1456
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:58,100
Who can protect you from me?

1457
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:01,400
The Almighty who saved
Ibrahim from the fire...

1458
02:00:01,770 --> 02:00:05,600
Yunus from the fish and
the boat from the storm.

1459
02:00:05,970 --> 02:00:09,340
These stories can give
assurance to weaklings.

1460
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:12,740
But it can't sway
Sadiq's strong resolution.

1461
02:00:13,230 --> 02:00:16,730
- For God's sake, don't mock him.
- What will happen?

1462
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:19,740
The same thing that happened to Shadab,
Namrood and Firon.

1463
02:00:20,570 --> 02:00:23,490
I swear on the Almighty.

1464
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:28,060
Nazir is alive. Nobody else knows
this secret besides me.

1465
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:30,000
It's Sadiq's ruse.

1466
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:33,930
Razia, don't enrage me
with your nonsense...

1467
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:35,666
or else you'll die.

1468
02:00:35,690 --> 02:00:40,396
The threat of death can never
snatch a woman's destiny and integrity.

1469
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:43,520
But today, you'll have
to marry me and fulfill my wish.

1470
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:47,940
Deceiver. Razia knows her husband is alive.

1471
02:00:47,970 --> 02:00:49,800
But he can't come here alive.

1472
02:00:50,210 --> 02:00:52,840
My accomplice is at the door
waiting to kill him.

1473
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:54,900
Oh heartless demon.

1474
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:58,320
Don't you feel ashamed to kill people?

1475
02:00:59,190 --> 02:01:01,820
Shame, decorum, integrity.

1476
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,600
These are the aids of weaklings.

1477
02:01:05,490 --> 02:01:07,190
Sadiq won't be influenced by all this.

1478
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:10,030
Tell me, do you agree or not?

1479
02:01:10,850 --> 02:01:14,030
Lord, it's the last hour of my trial.

1480
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:19,420
Please protect my honor and dignity.

1481
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:22,240
Razia, now you should take Sadiq's name.

1482
02:01:22,930 --> 02:01:24,230
And lovingly, too.

1483
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:27,260
Sadiq has become lustful.

1484
02:01:27,930 --> 02:01:31,640
He wants to destroy Nazir's home
and satiate his lust.

1485
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:35,920
Sadiq did so much to get Razia.

1486
02:01:36,690 --> 02:01:40,150
I beg to you for compassion and justice.

1487
02:01:40,650 --> 02:01:43,310
For God's sake leave me alone.

1488
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:52,010
Finally, beauty had to bow
before love.

1489
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:54,740
Get up, Razia.

1490
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:58,050
Your place lies in my heart
and not at my feet.

1491
02:01:58,520 --> 02:01:59,820
Rogue!

1492
02:02:00,170 --> 02:02:02,560
A woman's honor isn't so cheap...

1493
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:04,780
that your dirty hands could touch it.

1494
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:09,560
You'll have to sell your life,
honor and wishes to me.

1495
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,280
Never! I will die for my honor.

1496
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:15,700
But I'll never stigmatize womanhood.

1497
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:19,460
Look, your obstinacy shouldn't
become the cause of your death.

1498
02:02:20,820 --> 02:02:23,000
I prefer that death to
thousands of lives...

1499
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:25,160
that save a woman's dignity.

1500
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:28,400
Your life lies in my hand
and not in God's hand.

1501
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:29,720
Oh Lord!

1502
02:02:31,290 --> 02:02:32,390
Beware!

1503
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:38,880
You hit a woman and
stigmatize manhood! Oh demon!

1504
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:44,600
Who? Nazir?

1505
02:02:45,220 --> 02:02:49,780
Yes. God has kept me alive
to destroy your lust.

1506
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:53,640
I will give you another chance
since you're my friend.

1507
02:02:54,230 --> 02:02:56,720
Save your life from Sadiq and leave.

1508
02:02:56,900 --> 02:03:00,950
Keep quiet! You've
tarnished our friendship.

1509
02:03:01,290 --> 02:03:03,571
Under the guise of friendship
you've played such a game...

1510
02:03:03,690 --> 02:03:06,750
that people will always spit on your name.

1511
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:18,530
You fool. Not I,
but you're responsible for this mistake.

1512
02:03:19,710 --> 02:03:24,920
Yes. My fault was that I considered
a brute like you my friend.

1513
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:27,700
Tell me. How did I wrong you?

1514
02:03:28,030 --> 02:03:30,510
How did Razia harm you?

1515
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:33,530
What crime did Aslam and Salma commit...

1516
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:35,930
that you murdered them?

1517
02:03:36,430 --> 02:03:40,550
Today their death is
compelling me to kill you.

1518
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:44,350
Nazir, leave before I raise my hand.

1519
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:46,990
Leave? And spare your life?

1520
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:25,940
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!

1521
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:56,770
Nazir, forgive me.

1522
02:04:58,390 --> 02:05:00,200
For God's sake.

1523
02:05:01,590 --> 02:05:02,790
Forgive you?

1524
02:05:04,230 --> 02:05:05,530
You evil man.

1525
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:09,200
Today you're talking
about God and the prophet.

1526
02:05:09,560 --> 02:05:12,000
Don't you feel ashamed? Rogue!

1527
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:15,810
- My brother.
- Don't call me your brother.

1528
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:23,960
Nazir, let me atone.

1529
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:30,690
Oh prophet, help me.

1530
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,200
Oh Lord.

1531
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:42,680
Scoundrel. Look, God has also
shut his door to you.

1532
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:44,220
Get lost!

1533
02:05:56,870 --> 02:06:01,070
Oh tyrant

1534
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:15,470
You're taking revenge from a tyrant

1535
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:35,600
You're a noble man

1536
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:45,580
When that omniscience is seen...

1537
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,600
heads bow before you

1538
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:18,160
You separate people

1539
02:07:27,410 --> 02:07:33,800
You unite people

1540
02:07:34,690 --> 02:07:42,320
You destroy people.
You allow people to flourish

1541
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:52,150
Your wonder

1542
02:08:05,790 --> 02:08:10,080
How do I thank you?

1543
02:08:10,580 --> 02:08:12,330
You have gratified me.

1544
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:17,650
You snatched one son
and gave me two children in return.

1545
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:20,780
My patience has paid off.
