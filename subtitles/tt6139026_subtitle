1
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,320
Come

2
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,800
End of the 60's.

3
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,080
Seven months ago the
last case was solved.

4
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,400
Satyabati and her son plan
to visit Patna during the winter.

5
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,880
My bookshop is doing well.

6
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,000
So I can relax a bit.

7
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,680
Byomkesh is also without a case.

8
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,360
So I wanted to escort them to Patna.

9
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,640
But the night before,
the phone rings.

10
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Hello!

11
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,560
I'm Nishanath Sen.

12
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
- Called you late last night.
- Please come.

13
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Tea?

14
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
No, thanks.

15
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,760
Is Mr. Byomkesh in?

16
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

17
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,320
My visiting card.

18
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,840
- Are you Ajit Bandhopadhyay?
- Yes.

19
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,120
- Golap Colony, Mohanpur? - Yes.

20
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,640
I've a flower nursey.

21
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,920
It's called Golap Colony.

22
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,680
I run a flower business.

23
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,280
Along with vegetables,
handicrafts …

24
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,960
… For the last ten years.

25
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,920
You run a vegetable business?

26
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,000
It's been ten years.

27
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,560
Can't believe?

28
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,680
What did you do before this?
Any service?

29
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,520
How you guessed, I don't know.

30
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,840
I was a judge in
Bombay Sessions Court.

31
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,680
You quit your job
ten years back.

32
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,680
So, in these ten years …

33
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,560
So, you're now …

34
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,000
… around 75 years?

35
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,800
But you don't look it.

36
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,880
At age 50, I was forced
to quit my job.

37
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,760
High blood pressure.

38
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,480
Had a mild stroke.

39
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,240
Doctor asked me to
avoid stressful work.

40
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,880
At age 51, I resigned, came back
and started my business.

41
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,760
But … my pressure is on the rise.

42
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,800
That's why this visit.

43
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Why?

44
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,720
Here's Rs. 500 as advance.

45
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,800
- May I ask you a question?
- Certainly.

46
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,840
What's 'Blackmail' in Bengali?

47
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,320
Demanding money by threatening
to reveal secrets.

48
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,160
I too think so.

49
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,360
Let's start.

50
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:23,160
Except the gardener, no inmate
is normal in my colony.

51
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,360
They've come here, unable
to earn a normal living.

52
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,560
I've given them shelter.
Give monthly allowance.

53
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,600
On a condition.

54
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,000
They have to work in the colony.

55
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,560
Almost like a monastery...
a commune.

56
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,240
Please explain 'not normal'.

57
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,760
Panugopal is autistic.

58
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,440
Can't speak properly.

59
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,480
Was caught stealing.

60
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,920
He catches fish now.

61
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,400
Then there's Dr. Bhujangadhar.

62
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Extremely sharp.

63
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,480
Was a great surgeon.

64
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,040
He did an illegal surgery …

65
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,520
… And lost his medical licence.

66
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,520
He's the colony's doctor.

67
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,840
Then, all are criminals?

68
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,040
In one way … yes.

69
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Otherwise?

70
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,720
Didn't find the right path to live.

71
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,440
So you're reforming those
you had punished as a judge.

72
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,240
Let's talk about the real issue.

73
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:13,720
All farm produce of Golap
Colony are sold commercially.

74
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
At Calcutta's New Market.

75
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,480
The items are ferried
in our vehicles.

76
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,600
Everything was fine.

77
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,320
Suddenly one day…

78
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,320
Why do you think it's
a case of blackmail?

79
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,680
I think you should visit
our place once.

80
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,800
An hour's train travel.

81
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,360
Then two miles travel by road.

82
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,480
My car will pick you up
from the station.

83
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,360
Anyone in your colony,
connected to motor parts?

84
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,120
Mushkil Miyan.

85
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,680
Our driver.

86
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,920
Was a professional driver.

87
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,760
Killed someone while
rash driving.

88
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,680
His licence got cancelled.

89
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,520
Joined our colony.

90
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,160
He ferries the goods now.

91
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,200
No, thanks.

92
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,440
Gave up due to high pressure.

93
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Anyone else?

94
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,360
My nephew Bijoy.

95
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,560
He had a motorbike.

96
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,080
Sold it a year back.

97
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Your nephew?

98
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,560
Lost his parents.

99
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,640
Stays in the colony with me.

100
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,520
He accompanies Mushkil Miyan
to New Market.

101
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,480
I think you should come over.

102
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,880
I'll leave now.

103
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,640
One more thing.

104
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,160
Need some information
about a woman.

105
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,200
Sunayana.

106
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,640
Missing since two years.
Acted in a few Bengali films.

107
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,920
If you can find her photo
then it'll be very helpful.

108
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,040
Her photo will be there
in film magazines.

109
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Tea.

110
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,920
Thanks.

111
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,240
If you get her photo do inform.

112
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Bye.

113
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,160
So, we're not going to Patna?

114
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,040
Has paid Rs. 500, will pay more.

115
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,320
To Kashmir after Patna!

116
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,960
You'll get photos of old heroines
in a film magazine.

117
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,400
Isn't it?

118
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,000
Would he come here
if it was available?

119
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,400
Can't you escort the kid?

120
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,360
Ajit, he's given Rs. 600.

121
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
What?

122
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,400
Nishanath's not too
careful about money.

123
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,480
Motor parts and Bengali film heroines.
What's the connect?

124
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
He didn't say that!

125
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,040
Oh … two cases, then?

126
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,320
- That means two detectives.
- What?

127
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,960
Start investigating.

128
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,600
You've more knowledge
of Bengali films.

129
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,840
Oh, no!

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,160
You'll not get her photo
in a film magazine.

131
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,240
She acted in such trash films …

132
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,760
… No point writing about her.

133
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,960
The girl was pretty.
Acted well too.

134
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,960
We all tried to promote her.

135
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,320
But she chose other
things over acting.

136
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
Other things?

137
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,320
Things that wayward girls
of her age indulge in.

138
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,760
Greed for money. Lust. Scandals.

139
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,640
And to be honest …

140
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,120
… We, the producers of Bengali films,
aren't innocent either.

141
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,240
So, Sunayana trapped you too?

142
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,440
What were you saying?

143
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,520
Hang on.

144
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,880
No, I didn't get trapped.

145
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,840
Won't lie … I nearly strayed.

146
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,320
Since I was the producer,
she met me a few times.

147
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,760
Those days, we all met
here in the evenings.

148
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,520
All film folks.

149
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,680
I suggested the name - 'Sunayana'.

150
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,280
To Subimal.

151
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,760
The film director.

152
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,160
So 'Sunayana' is not her real name?

153
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,080
No. Her real name's Netyokali.

154
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,600
She was attractive. But the name
'Netyokali' was not right for films.

155
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,480
So, we can get her
photo from you.

156
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,120
No. I don't have her photo.

157
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,360
I made films with my
father's savings.

158
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,040
Making films was my passion.

159
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,320
Producing good films
with good directors.

160
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,880
With the likes of Satyajit Ray, Ritwik
Ghatak, Tapan Sinha, Mrinal Sen.

161
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,680
Sunayana had no role
in such films.

162
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Keep here.

163
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,800
What's the need of all these?

164
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,880
Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi's
first visit to my house!

165
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:30,400
Not sure of how much
I can help you.

166
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,480
True, I've got lots of
information about Sunayana.

167
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,360
Except the beginning
and the end.

168
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,880
That police also doesn't know.

169
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,040
Police is also involved?

170
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,920
Absolutely!

171
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,440
Two and a half years ago …

172
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,920
… I was chatting with Gourhari
in his studio office.

173
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,160
He wanted to film the
novel 'Bishbriksha'.

174
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,560
With his new found actress!

175
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,360
That's the first time
I saw Netyokali.

176
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,960
Will give you the role
of Kundonandini.

177
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Main role.

178
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,160
Okay?

179
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
No sir.

180
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
What?

181
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,040
I can't do a widow's role.

182
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Why?

183
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,360
I'm married.

184
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,320
I act in films for money.

185
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,720
If I play a widow, my
husband will be harmed.

186
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,440
Gourhari gave Sunayana the role
of Kamalini in his film.

187
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,720
We were awestruck after
the film was released.

188
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,480
What make up!

189
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,040
Hard to recognise her.

190
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,240
All in vain. The film flopped.

191
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,520
Then Sunayana signed
another film, 'Subarnalata'.

192
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,400
Role of a maid.

193
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,160
Outstanding performance!

194
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,760
And the same thing.

195
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,800
Brilliant makeup! Changed
her looks completely.

196
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,800
So there's no photo of
Sunayana's real look?

197
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,080
That would've helped the police.

198
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,480
Enchanted by the actress,
you want to produce films.

199
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,960
Will your aristrocrat father Mr.
Dutta agree?

200
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,480
He'll take care of it.

201
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,960
Here's your heroine!

202
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
Come.

203
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,640
She doesn't play
all types of roles.

204
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Do you know him?

205
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,760
One evening at my place …

206
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,360
… Sunayana dropped
in for a chat.

207
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,000
Must've heard of Dutta Jewellery?

208
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,120
It's owner Murari was
blown over by her.

209
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Hang on!

210
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,560
Murari Dutta … the murdered
owner of Dutta Jewellers?

211
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Yes.

212
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,920
He was stabbed by
someone at his home.

213
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,800
A diamond necklace and Rs. 40,000
was stolen from the safe.

214
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,080
So, Sunayana knew this fellow?

215
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,240
This wasn't in the newspapers.

216
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,920
Murari's family requested the police.

217
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,640
After all he was
from an elite family.

218
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,040
Do you think Sunayana
is linked to the murder?

219
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,080
That night, Sunayana was
with Murari in his house.

220
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,720
They left together for
his house from here.

221
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,280
Then?

222
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
I had informed the police.

223
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,800
But police couldn't find her.
Vanished!

224
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,040
Why is Mr. Nishanath
looking for Sunayana?

225
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,440
Will know once we're
at Golap Colony.

226
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,560
Are you joining us?

227
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,840
Shall we go in disguise this time?

228
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Not me, you.

229
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,040
I'm not putting on that
rubbish moustache.

230
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,320
Are you …

231
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,920
Salaam! Are you Mansur Miyan?

232
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,880
Yes!

233
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,720
These are my friends.

234
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
You?

235
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,920
I'm Mushkil Miyan.

236
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,400
The problem's that we
have to wait a bit.

237
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,880
Rashik Lal is returning from Calcutta.

238
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,720
We'll go together as he comes.

239
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,640
How long you've been driving?

240
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,280
Trouble is, I don't remember …
Long time ago.

241
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,640
Can you repair vehicles?

242
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,520
Yes, if there're small problems.

243
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,240
Nothing will happen to this

244
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,400
A tiger!

245
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,520
Has never stopped.

246
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,800
But the problem is...

247
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,200
Problem?

248
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,360
Push it a little harder.

249
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,160
Nishanath Sen's Golap Colony.

250
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,880
The idyllic environment
changed completely.

251
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,680
But I could not fathom it.

252
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,360
Driving through the scenic beauty …

253
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,480
… we reached our destination,
that can only be …

254
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,640
… Termed as …

255
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,000
… Zoo.

256
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,400
Welcome!

257
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,080
Any problem on road?

258
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
No!

259
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,320
Not at all.

260
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,720
Rashik Lal, have you
delivered the goods?

261
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Yes sir.

262
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,840
Rashik Lal …

263
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,720
Notorious goon of Park Circus.

264
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,280
Police caught him after
he lost his hand.

265
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,760
Came here after his jail term.

266
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,200
He does the delivery work.

267
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,440
Come.

268
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,800
Mushkil Miyan's wife.

269
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,480
She came here after
Mushkil Miyan went to jail.

270
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,640
She's a cook here.

271
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,200
She brought Mushkil here.

272
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,440
Let me introduce to you.

273
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,160
He's Mansur Ali.

274
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,520
MANSUR ALI.

275
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,920
Journalist. Interested in botany.

276
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,960
His friend Mr. Ramen
and …

277
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,480
… He's Byomkesh Bakshi.

278
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,880
Hello!

279
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Hello!

280
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,720
Seems I've seen you somewhere.

281
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,520
Really?

282
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,640
- Please inform others.
- Yes.

283
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,120
Mr. Mansur might speak to them.

284
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,840
He's writing about
us in a journal.

285
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
Yes!

286
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,440
Really? Nice nice.

287
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Excuse me.

288
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,160
Come in.

289
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,760
My wife, Damayanti.

290
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,120
They're doing a write up
on our nursery.

291
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,040
Oh!

292
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,120
He's Mansur Ali, the
famous journalist.

293
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,440
He's Mr. Bakshi.

294
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,720
And he's Mr. Ramen Mallick.

295
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,160
Sugar and milk in your coffee?

296
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Pardon?

297
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,760
He's hard of hearing.

298
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,240
Milk and sugar in your coffee?

299
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
Of course!

300
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,760
Have a seat.

301
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,840
No sugar for me.

302
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,000
Will you have lunch
before you leave?

303
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Songs?

304
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,960
I don't sing …

305
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
I click photos. Just a minute.

306
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,280
Thank you.

307
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
We'll go back and have lunch.

308
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,280
You speak Hindi quite well.

309
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,760
You'd given an extra Rs. 100

310
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,640
Got news of Sunayana.

311
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,840
Her real name's Netyokali.

312
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,600
Got involved in a murder case.

313
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,040
Police couldn't trace her yet.

314
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,520
The kitchen's behind that hut.

315
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,000
We all eat there.

316
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,400
My wife looks after the kitchen.

317
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,480
Mukul helps her.

318
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,280
Mukul!

319
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,320
They've come from Calcutta.

320
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,720
Will write about us.

321
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,720
What's there to write about me?

322
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,200
Willl write about us all.

323
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,280
About our Golap Colony.

324
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,960
I've got to go.

325
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Mr. Bijay will go to Calcutta.
Have to serve him lunch.

326
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Wait!

327
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,480
Wait a while.

328
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,240
Manners please!

329
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
One photo.

330
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
Thank you.

331
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,000
Mukul is Nepal's daughter.

332
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,360
When young, wanted
to act in films.

333
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,600
Nepal was my classmate
in school.

334
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,480
Professor of Chemistry.

335
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,560
An explosion accident in
his college laboratory …

336
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,160
… Burnt his face.

337
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,840
Was arrested as a
suspected terrorist.

338
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,960
Came here after his jail term.

339
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,120
Takes care of fertilisers
and vegetation.

340
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,440
And this is Panu … autist.

341
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,920
He helps Banalaksmi in
her handicrafts work.

342
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,840
You caught that big fish?

343
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Good!

344
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,320
Always tell the truth.

345
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,320
Always tell the truth.

346
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,720
Oh, yes! Of course!

347
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,040
Must tell the truth always

348
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,760
Banalakshmi's taught him.

349
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,520
He's very fond of her.

350
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,200
Banalakshmi loves him too.

351
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,040
He says that he'll let the fish go
and catch it again.

352
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Is it?

353
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,960
Let's see.

354
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Nepal!

355
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,480
Are you there?

356
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
What do you want?

357
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,880
My friends have come
from Calcutta.

358
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,240
Want to meet you.

359
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,440
Are we exhibits of a zoo?

360
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400
Now, don't get started.

361
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
They've come from far.

362
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
Open the door!

363
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,080
The door's open.

364
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,920
He's Mansur Ali,
famous journalist.

365
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,520
He'll write about us.

366
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,760
And they're his friends.

367
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,960
They wish to talk to you.

368
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
That's better!

369
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,360
I thought you've hired sleuths
to solve the mystery of motor parts.

370
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,000
He's Mr. Nepal,
takes care of fertilisers.

371
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,200
Have you told them you don't
like using my fertilisers?

372
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,160
My business will suffer if
I use your fertilisers.

373
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,960
That'll happen anyhow.

374
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,320
No need to use fertilisers.

375
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,680
You're sheltering a viper.

376
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,880
Willl sting you one day.

377
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,880
Serving the country, huh!

378
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,480
You'll be exposed one day.

379
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Which …

380
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,400
… Fertiliser do you use?

381
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,440
Will you write what I said?

382
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,720
He is not what he appears to be.

383
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,400
And I, Nepal Gupta, I am
not what I look like.

384
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Okay.

385
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,960
Now leave!

386
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,880
You play chess?

387
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
Ludo!

388
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,080
I mean, you play alone?

389
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,560
Like to play?

390
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,080
One round then.

391
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,840
Fine.

392
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,240
You all go ahead.
I'll join you soon.

393
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,960
What are you preparing, Brajadas?

394
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,560
Making laxative for the cows.

395
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,360
Good!

396
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,200
Give a little to Mr. Nepal.

397
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
What?

398
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,480
They're here to write about us.

399
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,240
He's Brajadas.

400
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
He was a cashier before.

401
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,520
His name is Brajadas.

402
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,520
Now he takes care of
the farm animals.

403
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,680
What do you feed the bovines?

404
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Bo …?

405
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Cow!

406
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
This.

407
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Let's …

408
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,160
Let me show you the clinic.

409
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
Over?

410
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,880
Yes. He beat me
in swift moves.

411
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Expert player.

412
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,520
I think he's recognised me.

413
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,240
Here's the doctor!

414
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,360
Was going to meet you.

415
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,400
Let me introduce them.

416
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,840
They'll write about us.

417
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,520
He's the reporter Mansur Ali.

418
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,480
And he's …

419
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Ramen Mallick.

420
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,480
Morning!

421
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
And …

422
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
Byomkesh Bakshi.

423
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
I see.

424
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,960
So, you are the
famous detective.

425
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,640
Did you smell mystery here?

426
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,120
Here it's only the
scent of roses.

427
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,000
Roses have thorns too.

428
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,280
Well said, Mr. Bakshi.

429
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,360
I'm Bhujangodhar, follow me.

430
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,200
This is my clinic-cum-residence.

431
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,680
May I serve you all tea?

432
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,440
No, they've already had.

433
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,880
They'll have lunch at my place.

434
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,760
They've talked to everybody …

435
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,480
… Except Banalakshmi.

436
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,400
Can she talk?

437
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,800
You play the sitar?

438
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,040
A bit.

439
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,280
Quite a good player.

440
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,840
Physician who's also a musician.

441
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,800
A detective who's also
interested in roses.

442
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,520
Doctor, why do you dislike
Banalakshmi?

443
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,920
Because you all like her.

444
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,440
She has a bad cold.
Give her medicine.

445
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,920
I gave.

446
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,040
Can't force her to have it.

447
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,320
Then she'll bad-mouth me.

448
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,840
Okay, come with me …

449
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,440
… I'll firmly tell her.

450
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Okay, let's go.

451
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,440
Aren't you having the medicines
given by the doctor?

452
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,280
Handicrafts will suffer
if you fall ill.

453
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,840
The medicine's not working.

454
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Hear that!

455
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,640
Don't worry …

456
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,920
… Your work won't suffer.

457
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,400
I will worry.

458
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,560
Please have medicines on time.

459
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Understood?

460
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,560
Let me introduce …

461
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,280
They're writing about
our Golap Colony.

462
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
He'll write.

463
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,560
Good …

464
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Photo!

465
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
One.

466
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
Thank you.

467
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,120
Let me see what's Panu doing?

468
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Thanks.

469
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Panu!

470
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
No …

471
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
I mean the place's not bad.

472
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,360
Lost my licence in an
illegal operation.

473
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,040
We're all like, in your words,
thorns of roses here.

474
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,080
What happened to Banalakshmi?

475
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,480
Bijoy brought her here.

476
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,800
Was crying sitting at a
corner of New Market.

477
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,840
Excuse me, I've got
to go to Calcutta.

478
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,520
I'll see you later.

479
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,720
Was involved in a squabble in
Free School Street.

480
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,760
Had to stay in a lockup.

481
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,520
Had no place to stay,
after her release.

482
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,120
Bijoy brought her here.

483
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,040
I can bet …

484
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,440
… that none of the women
here is Sunayana.

485
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,200
What tells you Sunayana's here?

486
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,160
Sorry, Mr. Byomkesh, I
can't answer this question.

487
00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:00,840
What was your scandal,
Prof. Nepal hinted at?

488
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
I don't know it myself.

489
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,080
You came to my house.

490
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,280
Wanted to know the
meaning of 'blackmail'.

491
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,760
Gave me Rs. 500.

492
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,480
Invited us over and
appointed me.

493
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Why?

494
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,760
I'm sorry Mr. Byomkesh.

495
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,440
I felt I needed to
know something.

496
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,320
I'm sorry Mr. Ramen for
wasting your time.

497
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,080
What's up Panu?

498
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,000
The mouse's scared to death!

499
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,880
Is it that fish?

500
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
That one?

501
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,600
A real tiger!

502
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,520
Will take your snap.

503
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,640
Will take your photo!

504
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Photo!

505
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,640
Hold the fish.

506
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,840
Take the fish.

507
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Smile.

508
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
Thank you!

509
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,320
It's over.

510
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,480
Done!

511
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,880
Put the fish down.

512
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,400
Take it to the kitchen.

513
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Go.

514
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,920
He can read and write.

515
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,920
Banalakhmi teaches him.

516
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,000
Anybody from your past
who could be …

517
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,640
… Connected to cars
or motor parts?

518
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,600
Years ago …

519
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,400
… While in Bombay, I had …

520
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,200
… Given death sentence to a
motor mechanic for murder.

521
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,080
In a fit of anger,
with a spanner …

522
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,520
… Killed his colleague.

523
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
Then?

524
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,040
Appealed to the High Court.

525
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Wasn't hanged.

526
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,680
Lal Singh was given a life term.

527
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,600
So, now he's in jail.

528
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
At times …

529
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,000
… Jail term get reduced
for good behaviour.

530
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,800
So, is he out of jail now?

531
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Panu!

532
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,320
Always …

533
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,800
… Speak the truth.

534
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
Correct!

535
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,400
If Lal Singh's out of jail …

536
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,920
… And if he …

537
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,880
… Kept those motor parts, then …

538
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,080
… What's his intention?
To blackmail?

539
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
For what?

540
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,520
What's his connect with Sunayana?

541
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,600
Mr. Nishanath has given
shelter to Sunayana.

542
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,040
Lal Singh knows that?

543
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,560
Then how are Sunayana
and Lal Singh related?

544
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,840
Now, tell me …

545
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,280
… How all are connected.

546
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,440
Mukul is Mr. Nepal's daughter.

547
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Najarbibi is Mushkil Miyan's wife.

548
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,440
Damayanti is Nishanath's wife.

549
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,600
Bijoy is Nishanath's nephew.

550
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,520
All this is known.

551
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,760
Tell me the unknown.

552
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,600
Strange!

553
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,760
How'll I know that?

554
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Use your brains!

555
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,120
Relationship can be good, or, bad.

556
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,920
Dr. Bhujango and Banalakshmi
have a bad relation.

557
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
Good!

558
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
Proceed.

559
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,400
Panugopal likes you a lot.

560
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
Very good!

561
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,360
Proceed.

562
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,080
Now you say.

563
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,120
The viper Mr. Nepal
alluded to …

564
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,320
… Who's that?

565
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,640
Sunayana?

566
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,600
Bijoy's in Calcutta today.

567
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,880
Bhujango too.

568
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,440
That's simple.

569
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,960
Bijoy has come to
collect payments.

570
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,960
And Dr. Bhujango has
come to buy medicines.

571
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,240
No Ajit, nothing is
falling into place.

572
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Hello!

573
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Yes.

574
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
Mr. Nishanath.

575
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,400
Who?

576
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,720
Mr. Nishanath.

577
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,480
Hello!

578
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Mr. Byomkesh?

579
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,720
Yes, Mr. Nishanath?

580
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,400
Am sorry for disturbing
you at this hour.

581
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,960
- Have to tell you something.
- Tell me.

582
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,360
I am really ashamed to
have troubled you.

583
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,720
Hassled you for nothing.

584
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,040
This is my work.

585
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,800
Don't know how to explain.

586
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,640
You might misunderstand me …

587
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,920
… But I've nothing to do.

588
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:27,400
I don't want you to investigate
the matter further.

589
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,880
The advance I've given you,
has been utilised.

590
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,160
With this case …

591
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,360
Please hold on.

592
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
He has put me on hold.

593
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Who?

594
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
So late at night …

595
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,040
What?

596
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,200
Can you hear anything?

597
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,600
A sitar being played.

598
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Sitar?

599
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,800
Yes. Sitar.

600
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,960
Raga Malkauns.

601
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Go inside.

602
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,360
Can't you realise what's
happening around you?

603
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Hey!

604
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Hey Najar!

605
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Go!

606
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,160
Spying!

607
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,960
Aren't you ashamed?

608
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:51,880
Who Called  ?

609
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,280
Has Satybati reached safely?

610
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,240
Mr. Nishanath has been murdered.
Barat called.

611
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,560
Barat?

612
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,880
He's posted there.
We've to go now.

613
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,400
Hit on the back of his head.

614
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,680
Instant death.

615
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,320
Had high blood pressure.

616
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,160
The doc here informed.

617
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,640
Police's doctor is on way.

618
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,000
Weird place this!

619
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,080
You must be knowing.

620
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,440
There's someone called Rashik Lal.

621
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,000
He worked in the office.

622
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,040
Bijoy informed that Rashik
had some money with him.

623
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
He's missing.

624
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,840
I think it's a case of robbery.

625
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,320
Rashik Lal was a notorious
goon of Calcutta.

626
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,880
To steal …

627
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,080
… Kill first. Put the body on bed.
Then cover with blanket.

628
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,440
That too with one hand!

629
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,320
Who's saw the dead body first?

630
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
Aunt.

631
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,920
Brought bed-tea and saw …

632
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,120
She informed you?

633
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,120
Mukul.

634
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,400
Mukul?

635
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Or aunt?

636
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,000
Mukul came, on hearing
aunt's cries.

637
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,200
Then she called me … and …

638
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,640
Where's aunt now?

639
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
In her room.

640
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
How's she now?

641
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,880
A little stable.

642
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,920
I've given her a sedative shot.

643
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,640
She needs some rest.

644
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,200
I'll ask a few questions and leave.

645
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
Yes.

646
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,680
Where were you at
10'oclock last night?

647
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Kitchen.

648
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,960
What did you see
after coming out?

649
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,360
He was sleeping.

650
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,640
I also went to my
room and slept.

651
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,280
You surely want your husband's
killer to be arrested?

652
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
Yes.

653
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,120
Now take rest. I'll come again.

654
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,960
I need to talk to you, doctor.
Let's go Ajit.

655
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Sure!

656
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,680
Who gains the most on
Mr. Nishanath's death?

657
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,120
What?

658
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,520
Who's getting his property?

659
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,120
Aunt and I.

660
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,600
Is my interrogation over?

661
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,960
Mukul's very upset
seeing the dead body.

662
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,280
Have to check her pressure.

663
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,440
Interrogation's just started.

664
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,280
You're playing Malkauns
quite well last night.

665
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,080
Mr. Bakshi!

666
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,520
What are you doing here?

667
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,440
Not well?

668
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,720
Get back to your work.

669
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,600
Brajadas!

670
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,880
The master's gone.

671
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,360
What'll happen to us?

672
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,200
Do you know of your
master's scandal?

673
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,480
I have asked you a question.

674
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,960
For telling lies …

675
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,720
… Went to jail.

676
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,440
Then embraced Vaishnavism.

677
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,960
And promised never
to tell a lie.

678
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,120
Don't ask me this
question, please.

679
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,640
Keeping quiet is also
telling a lie.

680
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,800
Will he come back if I tell the truth?
Will he?

681
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,880
Don't you want the killer
to be punished?

682
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,440
Who punishes whom?

683
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,640
God does everything.

684
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,600
Your god will do nothing
if you don't help.

685
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,440
What were you doing last night?

686
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,320
Was listening to the
sitar sitting here.

687
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,640
Any witness?

688
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,640
No!

689
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,480
None!

690
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,640
Do others have any witness?

691
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,560
Leave!

692
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,640
Don't waste time
interrogating me!

693
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,800
The real culprits
are having fun.

694
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,760
Bloody unscrupulous! Debauch!

695
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,520
Characterless!

696
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,400
Reply what you're asked.

697
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,560
Shut up scoundrel!

698
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,480
Your uncle was characterless.

699
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,800
So are you!

700
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,800
Promised to wed my daughter yet
spend nights with other girls.

701
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,720
Do they know?

702
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,400
Do they know, you conspired
to usurp my uncle's property?

703
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,040
How's that possible?

704
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,120
You and your slimy aunt
own this.

705
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,840
Quickly tell us when
we have to leave.

706
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,600
It's unbearable here.

707
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,360
You can leave anytime.
I've no plans to evict you.

708
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,520
What pretence!

709
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,880
Why didn't you marry
Mukul after dating her?

710
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,440
Why do you go to
Calcutta so frequently?

711
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Money collection? Huh!

712
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,000
All know you've
stolen half of it.

713
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,200
Watch your mouth!

714
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,280
- We're leaving for now.
- Get lost!

715
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,800
Worthless detective!

716
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,280
You're supposed to wed Mukul?

717
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,680
Yes or no?

718
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,600
Yes.

719
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,360
Why didn't you marry?

720
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,800
Uncle was against it.

721
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,200
Najar! Come here!

722
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,400
Where were you spying
last night?

723
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,400
Why should I?

724
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,160
Can't sleep. So I roam about.

725
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
Where did you roam?

726
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,400
Everywhere.

727
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,960
What did you see?

728
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,520
Master's wife went to
that flower shed, there.

729
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,960
Do you like to be in films?

730
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,200
Yes.

731
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,360
What else you saw?

732
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,040
- Doctor was playing the sitar.
- And?

733
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,560
Want to say something?

734
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,360
What …?

735
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,440
Tell me.

736
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,600
Panu!

737
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,960
Panu!

738
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,840
Detectives, huh!

739
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,320
What were you doing
last night at ten?

740
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,400
In the room.

741
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,880
Listening to doctor's sitar?

742
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,120
He plays all the time.
I didn't notice.

743
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,520
What's the problem
between you and him?

744
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,880
- Everyone here knows.
- You say.

745
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,640
Can't say those indecent things.

746
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,680
Panu!

747
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,840
Where's he gone?

748
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,600
What did you do earlier?
Or that's unspeakable?

749
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,360
To survive, tried to
become a whore.

750
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,680
Couldn't.

751
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,160
Did you wish to act in films?

752
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,360
No.

753
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,080
I'm a village girl.

754
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,480
Don't know the ropes.

755
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,920
Great!

756
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,360
When did you sleep last night?

757
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,560
Problem is, I lose track
when I am sleepy.

758
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Addiction?

759
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,000
Problem is … can't tell a lie.

760
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,520
Where does your wife
roam about at night?

761
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,440
Can't say … I guess all around.

762
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,240
She's restless.

763
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,600
My wife's innocent.
She hasn't killed.

764
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,840
Who did?

765
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,000
Problem!

766
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,040
Panu!

767
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,440
I've nothing to say.

768
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,320
You don't even
know the question.

769
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,160
I was in my room last night.

770
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,040
Don't know about of others.

771
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,800
Wanted to act in films?

772
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,400
Yes.

773
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,880
Acted in a few bit roles.
Nothing more.

774
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,960
Why did you break up with Bijoy?

775
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,920
- Uncle disagreed? - Not at all!

776
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,720
I may not tell you that,
Mr. Byomkesh.

777
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,880
Certainly.

778
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,160
I'll find out.

779
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,920
Panu …

780
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,360
… Want to say anything?

781
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,160
Panu!

782
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,480
Want to tell me?

783
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,200
Want to tell?

784
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,440
Want to say, what
you saw last night?

785
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,960
Always … tell the truth.

786
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,560
Ajit!

787
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,800
What did you see last night?

788
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
Come, sit.

789
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,120
Ajit … a pen and paper.

790
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,120
Don't be afraid.

791
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,640
Write down.

792
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,680
Here, hold the pen.

793
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,040
Write anything.

794
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,880
Don't be afraid.

795
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,120
Write on this paper.

796
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,440
Write what you saw.

797
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,280
I know you can write.

798
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Well done!

799
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,680
Great, Panu!

800
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,720
None will scold you. Write.

801
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,400
What?

802
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,160
Panu!

803
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,160
Listen!

804
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,040
Panu!

805
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,120
Find out from Bombay
jail about Lal Singh.

806
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,800
Convicted of murder.
10 years back.

807
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,520
To blackmail Nishanath,
Lal Singh sent motor parts.

808
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,000
Why did he kill?

809
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,600
Puti!

810
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,920
Shall I serve dinner?

811
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,840
Again paratha and mutton curry?

812
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,480
You're the best detective!
Fetch it fast!

813
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,120
Is Bijoy linked to his aunt?

814
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,880
Hang on!

815
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,040
Bijoy had brought Banalakshmi.

816
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,920
She didn't have any
film connect.

817
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,360
Then, how did she connect
with Free School street?

818
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,280
A lie!

819
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,560
Is Damayanti in grief or acting?

820
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,640
Superb actress!

821
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,840
Said she was in the
kitchen at night …

822
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,040
… Yet Najar saw her
near the greenhouse.

823
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,440
Doc said Mukul was upset.
She didn't look so.

824
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,160
Either doc's lying or …

825
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,880
… Mukul's a superb actress.

826
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,080
Bijoy thinks, Mr. Nepal
wanted to head the colony.

827
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,120
But, how do Damayanti and Bijoy
gain from this death?

828
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,440
Bijay'll fire Nepal
if he's the owner.

829
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,880
Nepal feels so.

830
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,560
Out!

831
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,320
Did Bijay really get
linked to Banalakshmi?

832
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,080
That's why maybe he
broke up with Mukul.

833
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,320
So Mukul has a motive
for murder.

834
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,240
No lone woman can kill and
drag a dead body to bed.

835
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,160
Then who killed? Mr. Nepal?

836
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,960
She's out as well.

837
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,240
I've noted your weakness
for Banalakshmi.

838
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,640
The way you clasped her hands!

839
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,520
Soft, eh?

840
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,640
Quite tough!

841
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,120
Is Mukul the real Sunayana?

842
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,440
Why not Damyanti?

843
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,840
And, what's Nishanath's scandal?

844
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,760
Is Najarbibi acting too?

845
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,880
Is Panu really a simpleton?

846
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,320
What do you think?

847
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,040
I feel he's innocent.

848
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,160
Totally unaware and clueless?

849
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,160
That night when
we're in deep sleep …

850
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,960
… The mystery took a new turn.

851
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,800
Where to?

852
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,720
Outside.

853
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,120
Feeling stuffy.

854
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,880
Try and drink less.

855
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,320
Try to return early.

856
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,640
Would've posted guards
had I known.

857
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,360
My fault. Panu wanted
to confide in me.

858
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,720
Should've gauged it.

859
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,280
- The culprit has escaped!
- Find him!

860
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,360
- Will you check the body? - No!

861
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,720
Send them over.
Will interrogate.

862
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,680
Where did you meet Mr.
Nishanath?

863
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,280
In Bombay.

864
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,680
He's 30 years senior to you.

865
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,760
How did you marry?

866
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,880
After my father died …

867
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,360
… I worked in a lawyer's house.

868
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,600
Nishanath came there,
saw me and proposed.

869
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,560
Why did you sleep in
separate rooms?

870
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,560
That's personal.

871
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,720
Did you wish to act in films?
Is that personal too?

872
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:15,480
Mr. Byomkesh … it's wrong to
think I've killed my husband.

873
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,440
You'll gain from his murder.

874
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,840
What're you saying?

875
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,280
Without him …

876
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,400
He made me literate.

877
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,600
I respect him like God.

878
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,240
But that's not the
answer to my question.

879
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,600
Yes. I will gain financially.

880
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,600
You're Bijoy's aunt or a friend?

881
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,040
What's your point?

882
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,560
Can't aunts be friends!

883
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,320
You may not have
work but I have.

884
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,480
Irritating! Kept me
waiting outside.

885
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,280
Are we animals?

886
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,040
- Last night at 10 pm.
- Was drinking at home.

887
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,080
Why are you wasting my time?

888
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,520
- This is my work.
- Then use your brains!

889
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,040
Find out who's the viper.

890
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,800
Then you can solve
this case swiftly.

891
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,600
Kept me waiting
outside for so long!

892
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,920
Are we zoo animals?

893
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,800
Keep this notebook.

894
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,160
It's all written here.

895
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,240
Will save your brain work!

896
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,400
Did Mukul want to act in films?

897
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,480
Cut the slander.
I'll not spare you!

898
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,680
A autistic boy has
been murdered.

899
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,440
He wanted to tell me the truth.

900
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,000
If you lie, I won't
spare you either!

901
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,920
Did your daughter want
to act in films or not?

902
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,800
Yes, visited the studios
a couple of times.

903
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,680
Got some two-bit roles.

904
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,240
What does it prove?

905
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,120
That she's fallen?

906
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,320
The truth will be out.
You can't stop it.

907
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,000
You can leave now.

908
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,160
Don't you dare spread
any rumour!

909
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,200
Leave!

910
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:52,800
Out!

911
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,880
I won't spare you!

912
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,000
Don't malign me because
you got sold to them.

913
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,240
I won't spare you!

914
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,720
I'll leave this place today!

915
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,320
I'll not spare anyone!

916
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,640
Sleuths from Calcutta, huh!

917
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,040
Maligning my daughter and me …

918
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,240
I'll spare none. Not even you!

919
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,120
Bijoy, your turn.

920
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,360
The moonshine smile.

921
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,720
What?

922
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,160
A Sanskrit phrase.

923
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,800
Let me see what has happened.

924
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,320
Remove your hand.
Let me see.

925
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:38,960
There's a head injury.

926
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,560
Let me bandage it.

927
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,760
Come on! I won't bite you.

928
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,000
Such childish...

929
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,360
Leave me.

930
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,280
Nepal's gone crazy.

931
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,880
Throwing stones at random.

932
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,360
Panu wanted to
tell me something.

933
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,400
You're there then.

934
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,720
Did you tell this to anyone?

935
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,320
No … I …

936
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,920
Did you go to Calcutta
yesterday?

937
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,920
No …

938
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,720
Station master saw you
boarding the Sealdah train.

939
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,080
Yes, I went.

940
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,640
Doctor also went.

941
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,600
Mr. Nepal in his diary says …

942
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,240
… You've stolen colony's money.

943
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,640
True?

944
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,320
My uncle's money is my money.

945
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,960
So, I took it.

946
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,320
How much?

947
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,720
Didn't count.

948
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,000
5, 6, 10 thousands.

949
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,080
What did you do?

950
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,920
Been to the races.

951
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:20,600
Mr. Nepal thinks you left Mukul after
bringing Banalakshmi here.

952
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,480
Are you investigating based on Mr.
Nepal's words?

953
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,840
Not the right answer.

954
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,120
I trust Banalakshmi.

955
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,680
Last night after 10, what
were you doing?

956
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,360
Went to Banalakshmi's room …

957
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,120
- …To talk. - About what?

958
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,240
That's very personal.

959
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,440
Problem?

960
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,200
You can leave.

961
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:21,880
Married?

962
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,120
Was.

963
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,680
Got married while
studying in London.

964
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,080
Her name?

965
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,440
My wife's?

966
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,040
Nita.

967
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,240
Why didn't you bring her along?

968
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,960
Perhaps she didn't like
my colour anymore.

969
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,520
What and where did you study?

970
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,800
Royal College of Medicine.
Surgery.

971
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,080
Had a chamber in Calcutta?

972
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,200
Yes, in Marquis street.

973
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,760
- Still there? - No.

974
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,880
What were you doing
last night, at 10?

975
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,760
The usual activity.

976
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,320
Practise the sitar for an hour.

977
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,480
About Mr. Nishanath's scandal …

978
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,840
… Do you have any idea?

979
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,640
In this colony …

980
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,120
…Each one has a
scandal. I too have.

981
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,080
So nothing strange, if he had.

982
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,760
But I can't give you any detail.

983
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,960
Mr. Nepal thinks Bijoy …

984
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,800
… Left Mukul after
bringing Banalakshmi. True?

985
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,720
Quite possible.

986
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,160
A man can change his love.

987
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,560
It's quite natural and legal.

988
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,080
With you?

989
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,440
Banalakshmi?

990
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,920
Yes.

991
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,040
Nothing much to say.

992
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,840
Banalakshmi had a headache.

993
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,200
I gave her medicine.

994
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,520
Wanted to kiss her.

995
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,560
She thought I was
going to rape her.

996
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,360
She slapped me and left.

997
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,120
Idiot!

998
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,400
Why do you roam at night?

999
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,440
Don't feel sleepy?

1000
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,000
What did you see last night?

1001
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,640
Madam went to Bijoy's room.

1002
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,280
Then.

1003
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,600
Didn't see.

1004
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,800
Was Bijoy in his room?

1005
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,000
Don't know.

1006
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,200
What did you hear?

1007
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,320
Doctor's sitar.

1008
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,520
Chirping of crickets.

1009
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,000
Panu's sobbing.

1010
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,560
Mukul and Mr. Nepal's spat.

1011
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,600
Ajit!

1012
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,200
Last night you had a
spat with your dad.

1013
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,720
What's it to you?

1014
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,880
Mr. Bijoy visited Banalakshmi last night.
Did you notice?

1015
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,080
Mr. Bijoy was in his
room last night.

1016
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,640
You're an excellent actress!

1017
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:08,680
What?

1018
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,440
You weave the lies well.

1019
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,960
Told you what I saw
from my window.

1020
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,240
Are aware your master …

1021
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,920
… Used to receive motor parts?

1022
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:24,680
Yes.

1023
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:25,880
Who told you?

1024
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,440
Mr. Bijoy.

1025
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,120
Any idea who threw the stone?

1026
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,040
Couldn't see.

1027
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,360
Suddenly something
hit my forehead.

1028
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,160
Quite a gash!

1029
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,120
Nothing much.

1030
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,400
The glass bangles broke.

1031
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,120
Please ask.

1032
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,720
What's between you and Bijoy?

1033
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,160
He loves me.

1034
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,520
You?

1035
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,680
He's a gentleman.

1036
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,480
Didn't take advantage of me.

1037
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,360
Did Bijoy go to your
room after 10 pm?

1038
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,440
Yes … to chat.

1039
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:04,800
About what?

1040
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,240
Was listening to the sitar.

1041
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,120
Didn't talk much.

1042
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,320
What's wrong with your finger?

1043
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,840
Got cut while slicing veggies.

1044
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,840
Why was Panu murdered?

1045
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,440
Problem was … Panu
couldn't talk clearly.

1046
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,000
Tried telling you?

1047
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,360
He came to my room
in the evening.

1048
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,320
Was trying to communicate.
The problem was …

1049
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,640
Does your wife tell
you what she sees?

1050
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,720
Some.

1051
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,440
Who killed the master?

1052
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,200
If I knew it, like Panu,
I'd have been killed.

1053
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,920
What do you think Panu
wanted to tell you?

1054
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,920
Problem is, I don't know that.

1055
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,920
I'll find it out even
if you don't say.

1056
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,040
Go ahead!

1057
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,040
I'm not afraid.

1058
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,480
Can go to jail again.

1059
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,600
What?

1060
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:33,280
Unlocked door means …

1061
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,000
… Puti's out …

1062
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,800
… Clean room …

1063
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,080
… Back to rice and stew!

1064
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,680
Have these chops
instead of street food.

1065
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,720
When did you come?

1066
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:40,880
Today morning.

1067
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,480
The boy's fine there
with my brother.

1068
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,600
I was fine too.

1069
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,920
Brother thought you
two need my care.

1070
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,880
We were fine. The brain
needs stimulus.

1071
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,480
Since you're back, decode
'moonshine smile'.

1072
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,040
Brightly shining teeth.

1073
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,960
Teeth?

1074
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,240
Yes!

1075
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,440
One of these is your heroine?

1076
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,000
Could you find out?

1077
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,480
Teeth!

1078
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,120
Aha! Teeth reminds me.

1079
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,520
Nishanath's life is an
example of a proverb.

1080
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,120
Help to climb the ladder
and get kicked in the teeth.

1081
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,920
What happens if the
tooth's broken?

1082
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,320
Toothless.

1083
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:24,800
Hello!

1084
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,920
Barat here.

1085
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:28,320
Arrested Brajadas from
Sealdah station.

1086
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,040
Are you coming?

1087
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,200
Good job!

1088
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,680
Reaching soon.

1089
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:36,920
Brajadas has been arrested.

1090
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,400
It's happening! Mutton curry at night!

1091
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,200
I'm a Vaishnav.

1092
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,280
Won't tell a lie.
But …

1093
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,560
Can't tell the truth either.
So I fled.

1094
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,640
Swear on God, I didn't
steal Colony's money.

1095
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,960
That's my savings.

1096
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,480
Kept with Banalakshmi.

1097
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,280
You kept your savings
with Banalakshmi?

1098
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,280
Yes.

1099
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,000
She's an angel!

1100
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,680
Honest and good natured.

1101
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,880
Mr. Bijoy also keeps
money with her.

1102
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,960
You fled as you
didn't want to lie.

1103
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,480
What's the lie?

1104
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,640
Was my master's clerk
at Bombay High Court.

1105
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,800
He ordered Lal Singh
to be hanged.

1106
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,040
Lal Singh appealed.

1107
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,560
The Supreme Court
revoked the order.

1108
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,440
He got a life sentence.

1109
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:27,560
Next day a woman
came to his flat.

1110
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,360
Laj Singh's wife. Wanted
to meet my master.

1111
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,840
He had a sleepless night.

1112
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,360
Still tried to wake him up.

1113
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,440
Knew he wouldn't meet her.

1114
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:50,960
Told him she was
desperate to met him.

1115
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,360
I didn't sleep last night.

1116
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,840
I too didn't sleep last night.

1117
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,560
I'm Lal Singh's wife.

1118
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,680
I knew he was a bad person.

1119
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:14,920
And he got punished.

1120
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,880
But what's my fault, sir?

1121
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,920
I don't have anyone
in this city.

1122
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,920
Come in.

1123
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:30,960
Come here.

1124
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,280
Come.

1125
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,560
What work can you do?

1126
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,200
Everything, sir.

1127
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,480
Whatever you say.

1128
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,720
Cooking, dusting, washing.
I can do it all.

1129
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,120
It's quite late.

1130
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,280
Stay here tonight.

1131
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,480
It's okay.

1132
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,520
You go to sleep.

1133
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,080
You know Bengali?

1134
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,400
Yes.

1135
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,440
I was born in Calcutta.

1136
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,480
Met Lal Singh there.

1137
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,960
He brought me here.

1138
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,520
Tonight, don't go back
to your slum.

1139
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,800
Stay here.

1140
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,240
I was very angry.

1141
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,760
The man I held in high esteem …

1142
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,120
… Did this!

1143
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,520
Became furious.

1144
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,680
Stole his money.

1145
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,560
And got caught.

1146
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,320
Served two years in jail.

1147
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,840
Then came to Calcutta.

1148
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,640
Became a recluse.

1149
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,960
Heard master's built a colony.

1150
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,000
You know it all.

1151
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,600
Like you, I've also had
a change of heart.

1152
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,680
I couldn't marry
Damayanti because …

1153
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,240
… Lal Singh's in jail.

1154
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,160
They aren't divorced.

1155
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:57,200
So, I couldn't legally marry her.

1156
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,840
We stay together.

1157
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,640
Like a married couple.

1158
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:18,080
No one knows it.
Except Bijoy.

1159
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:26,040
Promise me you
won't tell anyone.

1160
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,040
Why am I receiving
the motor parts?

1161
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,240
I don't know.

1162
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,800
You still insist that you're
not in touch with Lal Singh?

1163
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,720
No, I am not.

1164
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,280
What'll make you believe?

1165
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,920
What did you do in Calcutta?

1166
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,080
What was your profession?

1167
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,240
Interrogating me?

1168
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,440
Don't change the topic.
Answer my question.

1169
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,080
You're yet to see
the evil in me!

1170
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,840
I am watching.

1171
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,360
How evil you can be!

1172
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,640
What did you do in Calcutta?

1173
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,520
What did you do there?

1174
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,520
Used to knock the film
studios for roles.

1175
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,240
Met Lal Singh, a taxi driver.

1176
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,040
Why didn't you say this before?

1177
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,400
Didn't feel the need.

1178
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,760
Since then, they started …

1179
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,640
… Sleeping in separate rooms.

1180
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,160
I could've saved Panu,
if you told this earlier.

1181
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,600
I didn't realise.
Please forgive me.

1182
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,680
You go back to Golap Colony.

1183
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,880
I promise you'll be unharmed.

1184
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,400
Tonight Ajit and I'll
stay in Golap Colony.

1185
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,520
You mean …

1186
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,440
… Chance of another murder!

1187
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,040
Possibility remains!

1188
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:03,160
It's known that, Byomkesh doesn't
believe in deduction or clues.

1189
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,840
He believes in instinct.

1190
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,640
His hunch is …

1191
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,120
… Golap Colony will …

1192
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,680
… Witness more killings.

1193
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,240
He goes checking around, as
I guard Brajadas at home.

1194
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,400
We plan to meet near the
greenhouse after an hour.

1195
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:53,600
You?

1196
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,840
What do you mean?

1197
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,160
I live here.

1198
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,320
Why are you here so late?

1199
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,280
You'll get your answers
from Inspector Barat.

1200
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:05,040
Roses need tea leaf
fertiliser at night.

1201
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,240
Don't you even know this?
Detectives!

1202
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:09,400
Ignorant snoopers!

1203
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,720
Harassing me?

1204
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,840
I won't spare any of you!

1205
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:14,160
I'll sue you!

1206
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:23,880
Byomkesh!

1207
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,840
I haven't worked with Sunayana.

1208
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:48,720
We do the make-up for
most of the actreses.

1209
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,000
But Bombay's actresses …

1210
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:56,280
… Pluck their eyebrows,
get their teeth set.

1211
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,240
Not possible in make-up.
We don't do it as well.

1212
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:04,880
Superstar heroine Sumitra
has full dentures.

1213
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,200
Looks so real!

1214
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,240
Coming!

1215
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,320
Hello!

1216
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,360
Is Mr. Byomkesh in?

1217
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,520
He's gone out. You are …?

1218
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,080
May I come in?

1219
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,120
Come in.

1220
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,360
I'm a great fan of his.

1221
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,640
Not in touch for long.

1222
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:42,440
Have rented a house in this locality.
So, dropped by.

1223
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,440
He's a busy man.

1224
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,520
I'll come some other day.

1225
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,680
Please give him my card.

1226
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:53,840
You can wait. He'll
be back soon.

1227
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,160
Tea …?

1228
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,480
Who's there?

1229
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,920
Don't know him.

1230
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,040
Koknod Gupta.

1231
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:04,960
Did you meet him?

1232
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:06,920
Who?

1233
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,560
Your old friend.

1234
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,640
Rented a house in this locality.

1235
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,840
- What's his name?
- Koknod Gupta.

1236
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,520
- Don't think I know.
- Thought as much.

1237
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,320
I know all your friends.

1238
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,600
Looks?

1239
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,640
Blak hat, dark shades,
scarf around his neck.

1240
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,040
Known to me, unknown to you?

1241
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,080
That's what …

1242
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,320
Hello!

1243
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,120
Barat speaking.

1244
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:33,640
Tell me.

1245
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:36,000
From Golap Colony, Bijoy's
going to the station.

1246
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,880
- Towards the station? - Yes.

1247
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,040
I'll be there soon.

1248
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,040
Going out again?

1249
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:46,400
Bijoy's probably in Calcutta.

1250
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,840
I'll find Panu's killer …

1251
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,000
… Or else, I'll quit.

1252
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:54,680
Ajit …

1253
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,200
Can Koknod Gupta be my
enemy and not a friend?

1254
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,640
I've no dearth of enemies.

1255
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,840
But, I know all your
enemies as well!

1256
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,400
Wait here.

1257
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,720
What took you so long?

1258
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,400
I'll be back in an hour.

1259
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:48,560
Thanks.

1260
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,800
Do you really want to
quit being a 'detective'?

1261
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,000
Not, if I can solve it.

1262
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,600
It's the word 'detective'.

1263
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,240
You're a truth seeker.

1264
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,760
You coined it. Not me.

1265
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,440
A gumshoe is a gumshoe
is a gumshoe!

1266
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,120
What's your point?

1267
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:02,360
There's difference between real beard
and a false one.

1268
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,120
Clear as muddy water!

1269
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:14,760
Duck was porcupine …

1270
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,760
Don't follow the grammar.

1271
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,640
Became a Duckupine …

1272
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:22,920
Where have you been?

1273
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:24,520
New Market.

1274
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,320
Should've told me. I needed …

1275
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,320
What?

1276
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,960
Why so angry?

1277
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,400
Glass bangles break often.
Wanted to buy the plastic ones.

1278
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,560
Don't women need bangles?

1279
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,520
As if, heroines only use bangles!

1280
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,320
I too needed to
buy a toothbrush.

1281
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,440
Tooth?

1282
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,640
- Tooth? - Yes.

1283
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,320
Ajit …

1284
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:53,280
If Koknod Gupta's my enemy, he
wouldn't want me to recognise him.

1285
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,560
Obviously!

1286
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,560
Then, what would he do?

1287
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,320
Simply …

1288
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,000
- … Change the appearance.
- Exactly!

1289
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,640
- What did you say? - Bangles.

1290
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:04,000
No, the exact word. What was it?

1291
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,080
What?

1292
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,240
Plastic … plastic bangles.

1293
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:09,200
Plastic … plastic! Heroine!

1294
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,280
Got it!

1295
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,440
Knocking off teeth …

1296
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,960
… Doesn't make one toothless.

1297
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,520
Changes the appearance.

1298
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,880
- Hello! - Byomkesh here.

1299
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,480
Golap Colony. This evening.

1300
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,040
Take a constable and your rifle.

1301
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,280
- Before that need to conduct a raid.
- Okay.

1302
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,320
Write the address.

1303
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,600
Two years back.

1304
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:38,760
Actress Netyokali killed
producer Murari Dutta and fled …

1305
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,240
… Stealing loads of cash
and a diamond necklace.

1306
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,880
Police his yet to find her.

1307
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,680
Mr. Nishanath wanted me
to search out Sunayana.

1308
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,160
He thought Sunayana's in
this Colony in disguise.

1309
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,480
Which means …

1310
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:10,000
… Banalakshmi, Mukul,
Najarbibi and Damayanti …

1311
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,720
… One of them is Sunayana.

1312
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:20,520
I brought a producer here
who's seen Sunayana.

1313
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,200
But he negated all.

1314
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:29,520
That very night Mr.
Nishanath was murdered.

1315
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,080
Which means …

1316
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:37,280
… Seeing me, Sunayana got scared
of getting caught.

1317
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,760
And to stop the investigation …

1318
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,400
… She killed Mr. Nishanath.

1319
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,160
So, the conclusion is …

1320
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,440
… Sunayana is here, in this room.

1321
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,800
She's here but we aren't aware.
Good!

1322
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,240
Is it possible?

1323
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,520
On the night of Panu's murder …

1324
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,760
… You said, you were in
Banalakshmi's room. Right?

1325
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,200
Yes.

1326
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:13,960
If I say no?

1327
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,200
So, both of us are lying?

1328
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:20,960
Yes!

1329
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,720
Banalakshmi, you said that …

1330
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,800
… While chopping vegetables,
your fingers got hurt. True?

1331
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,080
Why shall we lie?

1332
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:32,280
You'll gain if Nishanath's killed.

1333
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,600
So you top the suspect
list. Obviously!

1334
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,360
Panu saw the murderer.

1335
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,640
When he came to inform me …

1336
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,520
… Besides me, Ajit and Panu …

1337
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,760
… You were there.

1338
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,560
So, the suspicion gets stronger.

1339
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,320
I came to interrogate
after Panu's murder.

1340
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,040
Obviously, you needed
a strong alibi then.

1341
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,960
You asked Banalakshmi to say
that you were in her room.

1342
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:05,880
And Banalakshmi too …

1343
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,840
… Lied to save you.

1344
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,440
Right, Mukul?

1345
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,200
Again you're slandering
my daughter!

1346
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,400
- I'll file a defamation suit!
- Mr. Nepal!

1347
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,160
Exactly! Why are you
shouting?

1348
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,360
Listen to what he's saying.
You please carry on.

1349
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,360
Put your leg down.

1350
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,920
Bloody fraud doctor!

1351
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,640
- Glugging away!
- Have a sip.

1352
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,240
Bloody racket of rogues!

1353
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,520
What's happening?

1354
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:32,680
Madam Damayanti!

1355
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:36,280
For whom did you keep
money in the greenhouse?

1356
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,120
What nonsense!

1357
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,840
Didn't ask you!

1358
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,680
Will you say or shall I?

1359
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,800
Some days back, I
received a letter.

1360
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,360
In it was written …

1361
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,840
"I'm out of jail."

1362
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,960
"Seen your Colony too."

1363
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:59,040
"Day after, a motor part will be
there, near your house."

1364
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:04,880
"Keep Rs. 500 in the rose pot
in greenhouse, the same night."

1365
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,920
"Or else I'll wreak havoc
in your family life."

1366
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:09,040
"Lal Singh."

1367
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,840
So whenever a letter comes …

1368
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,280
… You keep money in
the greenhouse.

1369
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:16,960
Who knew this?

1370
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:18,920
Only Bijoy.

1371
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,760
Bijoy tells it to Mukul and …

1372
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,040
… Then to Banalakshmi.

1373
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:28,600
What do you want to prove?

1374
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,520
That …

1375
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,040
… Many in this Colony
know about this mystery.

1376
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,480
So, an insider was blackmailing.

1377
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,120
My daughter blackmailed!?

1378
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,360
Brajadas flees this colony.

1379
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,400
And returns.

1380
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,160
Bijoy thought Brajadas is
in touch with Lal Singh.

1381
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,440
So, last night, wearing gloves …

1382
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:53,040
… Unsuccessfully tried to kill him.

1383
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,200
Can you prove it?

1384
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,520
Weak attempt at murder,
doesn't land one in jail.

1385
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:11,120
It defames.

1386
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,200
You'll suffer that.

1387
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,240
Banalakshmi, you didn't
answer me yet.

1388
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:17,840
I've told you …

1389
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:20,520
…I cut my fingers
while chopping veggies.

1390
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:23,040
I don't believe Bijoy
has murdered.

1391
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:26,400
You don't mistrust Bijoy.
Because you love him.

1392
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,840
And in Nishanath's absence,
you can even marry him.

1393
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,240
Because …

1394
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,240
According to Bombay jail …

1395
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,440
Lal Singh died in
jail five years ago.

1396
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:43,240
Then who was blackmailing?

1397
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:46,120
You've told everybody of
Nishanath's scandal.

1398
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,240
- Mr. Nepal, you know it, right?
- What?

1399
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:50,880
I am blackmailing?

1400
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,840
Doc, What did you say
was your wife's name?

1401
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,480
Nita.

1402
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,360
If I say Nita is … Netyokali!

1403
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,560
Netyokali … a Brit lady?

1404
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,480
No, a pure Bengali!

1405
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,800
Worked in films for money.

1406
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,320
Killed Murari Dutta …

1407
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,400
… And fled stealing his
diamond necklace.

1408
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,760
No idea what you're
talking about.

1409
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,040
Yes, you do!

1410
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,200
You still have the clinic
at Marquis Street.

1411
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,000
Probably it's no
longer a clinic but …

1412
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,880
It's where you
keep your secrets.

1413
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:30,240
The spare key's with Mr.
Verma of 2nd floor, right?

1414
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,320
Maybe.

1415
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:36,240
Perhaps Netyokali was my client.
I don't remember.

1416
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,600
You're a surgeon.

1417
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:44,240
You altered Netyokali's face
by plastic surgery.

1418
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,240
Maybe. I don't
remember my surgeries.

1419
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:48,680
Sorry!

1420
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:51,120
I don't recollect it. Sorry.

1421
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:54,360
How's Mr. Nishanath's murder
linked to this?

1422
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Simple.

1423
01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:00,480
To protect your true identities
and carry on blackmailing …

1424
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,400
… You killed Mr. Nishanath.

1425
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:06,080
What utter rubbish! What
are you talking about?

1426
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,440
Panu saw it.

1427
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,320
He wanted to tell me.

1428
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,640
So you killed him too.

1429
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,240
Mr. Bakshi …

1430
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,640
… You're forgetting that …

1431
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,000
At the time of murder, I was
playing the sitar in my room.

1432
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,600
Malkauns!

1433
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,680
You were not in your room.

1434
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:33,440
The one who really played,
for two consecutive nights …

1435
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,080
… Cut her fingers on the strings.

1436
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,200
Banalakshmi …

1437
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,600
… Alias Sunayana …

1438
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,880
… Alias Netyokali!

1439
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,080
All these accusations …

1440
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:57,360
… Have to be proven in court.

1441
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,160
Probably you're right.

1442
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,800
Not possible till you confess.

1443
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,120
For your information …

1444
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:07,680
… Police raided your so
called clinic in the morning.

1445
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,600
And they found the stolen
diamond necklace!

1446
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:13,720
So you see doc …

1447
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,480
… You've got to go to jail.

1448
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,320
Nita!

1449
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:39,000
For the last time,
before leaving the colony.

1450
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,440
Let's bid farewell to all.

1451
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:49,400
What! Had cyanide in
mouth at that time?

1452
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:51,800
Incredible!

1453
01:37:52,360 --> 01:37:54,680
The climax is like
a Bombay bioscope!

1454
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,160
No, Hollywood.

1455
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,680
Indian censors won't
allow the kiss.

1456
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:05,160
Your trump card was
the plastic surgery bit.

1457
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:08,800
In this regard, your wife's
contribution was immense.

1458
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,080
Earlier, Byomkesh had a hunch.

1459
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:17,280
True, she linked 'moonshine smile'
with teeth.

1460
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,080
Doc said it once in the verandah.

1461
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:23,440
I think he addressed
Banalakshmi then.

1462
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,080
Perhaps, Banalakshmi
forgot the dentures.

1463
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:31,400
Hearing the doc, she faked
being hit by a brick piece.

1464
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:33,840
Then fell down and cut her
forehead with glass bangles.

1465
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,160
She goes to her room
to apply medicine.

1466
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,360
Comes back with the dentures.

1467
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:38,480
Right?

1468
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,640
Elementary, my dear.

1469
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:42,800
Extraordinary!

1470
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Full of suspense!

1471
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,480
I must make a bioscope on you.

1472
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,240
- Mr. Ajit!
- Yes?

1473
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:54,080
May have the rights to a story?

1474
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,440
That depends on the offer.

1475
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,480
But who'll play my role?

1476
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:08,200
Shall I ask Uttam?

1477
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,280
Yes, yes!

1478
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,200
Who?

1479
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,040
Uttam Kumar!

1480
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,320
Uttam … Kumar?

1481
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:16,120
Not right?

1482
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,800
Of course, yes!

1483
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,720
Don't listen to him.

1484
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:22,040
After 'Nayak', Uttam really
excels in out of the box roles.

1485
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,240
I've a request.

1486
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,800
Ajit has to get
married in the film.

1487
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,240
Agreed!

1488
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:34,440
No matter how much Byomkesh
deals with complex social evils …

1489
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:38,440
… His own life is plain
and simple.

1490
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:44,240
He gives an impression of
a simple middle-class Bengali.

1491
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:50,720
He doesn't have the air and pomp,
usually associated with detectives.

1492
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,280
But, if you watch closely.
