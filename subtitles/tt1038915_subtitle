1
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:36,128
Terrorists linked to Al Qaeda
finally strike London.

2
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,434
Thousands of police officers
are involved in a hunt for

3
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,007
the people who tried to bomb
the London underground

4
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:42,407
and a bus, among
them armed officers

5
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:44,979
who have been told they
can now shoot on sight

6
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:47,048
suspected suicide bombers.

7
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:16,182
Train is due in one minute.

8
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:17,692
Suspect is preparing to board.

9
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,185
Blooming hell.

10
00:03:20,263 --> 00:03:23,198
Repeat. Suspect is preparing
to board. Should I detain?

11
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,324
Request instructions.

12
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:27,126
Hold position.
Go commander.

13
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:28,568
She's bull dog.
Suspect is about to

14
00:03:28,672 --> 00:03:30,468
board a crowded commuter train.

15
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:33,133
I need instruction. I need
it five blooming minutes ago.

16
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:34,267
Please respond.

17
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:35,435
Sir?

18
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,514
Tell them...
Tell them to keep him off the tube.

19
00:03:43,285 --> 00:03:44,548
Deadly force is authorised.

20
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:48,816
Bulldog. This is Operations.
You are clear to go.

21
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:51,159
Deadly force is authorised. Repeat.

22
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,818
Deadly force is authorised.

23
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:04,899
Police, open the gate.

24
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,281
Police, move. Police, get out
of the way. Move. Police. Move.

25
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:21,787
Police, move it, move.
Get out of the way. Move.

26
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,324
That way.

27
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,500
Move. Police, move out of the way.
Move, Police. Police.

28
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:39,901
Get out of the way,
Police. Get out the way, move.

29
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:45,704
That's him. Get down. Get down.

30
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:50,609
Armed police. Put your
hands above your head.

31
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:54,277
Drop to your knees. Do it.
Hands above your head.

32
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,751
Now. Don't.

33
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,570
Okay. Okay, good. Where is it?

34
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:25,479
Here. What's this?

35
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,400
Mp3.

36
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:56,813
It's a music player,
like a walkman, sir.

37
00:05:57,614 --> 00:06:01,607
I know what it is.
I do have grandchildren.

38
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:14,363
What a mess.

39
00:06:15,065 --> 00:06:17,932
Begging your pardon, sir,
but I don't see that it is a mess.

40
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:21,428
Really?

41
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:28,370
Open your eyes. What
does that tell you?

42
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:33,576
Bloody media. Never there
when we do something right.

43
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,713
Meaning we're in
the wrong this time?

44
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,480
No, sir. Slip of the tongue.

45
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:41,882
What do we know for certain?

46
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:44,326
The suspect, Baqir Hassan emerged

47
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:46,588
from the residence
we were surveying.

48
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:48,721
We had intelligence
that terrorist activity

49
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,594
was being conducted there.
- Intelligence?

50
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,394
An anonymous tip was called in.

51
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:53,526
Can we trace the call?

52
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:56,503
We're trying, but they don't
exactly leave their details.

53
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:58,595
What they could, they did on him.

54
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:04,346
Commander. Any minute now,
I will be getting a call

55
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:06,414
from our new
Commissioner of Police

56
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:07,948
and I will have to
inform him that

57
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:09,447
only six weeks into
his administration

58
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:12,884
we've already
managed to lay a huge

59
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:15,478
career-destroying
scandal on his doorstep.

60
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,622
Perhaps, levity is not in your
best interest at this moment.

61
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:21,519
Sir, sorry.

62
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:29,499
This, D.I. Marber, is it?
What does he have to say?

63
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:32,436
The suspect didn't respond to
a lawful order to surrender.

64
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,564
Because he couldn't hear it?

65
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:37,739
Or he willingly chose to
ignore it? Who's to say?

66
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:40,375
The I.P.C.C. I would imagine.

67
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,382
With all due respect, sir.
D.I. Marber and his officers

68
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:46,077
followed policy to the letter.

69
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,945
They did. And now it looks
as if Scotland Yard has

70
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,489
declared war upon
innocent civilians.

71
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:52,816
If you wanted us...

72
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:54,560
Do you have
evidence to the contrary?

73
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:56,458
Oh, he was a Muslim.

74
00:07:56,596 --> 00:08:02,466
Being a Muslim isn't a crime,
Commander. Not yet, anyway.

75
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,468
Yes?
- Commissioner on the line for you, sir.

76
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:07,766
I will be with him right away.

77
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:09,531
What are you going to tell him?

78
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:15,004
The truth. That we're not
very sure at this point.

79
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:18,507
You can show yourself out.

80
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,820
John, the Commissioner is
keeping a close eye on us.

81
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,517
He's made it clear he
wants things sorted quickly.

82
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,719
Or someone in this
office will pay the price.

83
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:35,524
And I can assure you,
it will not be me.

84
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:39,160
Sir.

85
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:49,543
Commissioner, I have it
right here. Yes, sir. I agree.

86
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,846
I think we've found our man.

87
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:02,590
Beg your pardon, sir. They
are waiting for you upstairs.

88
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:18,798
Well, Tariq.
- Morning.

89
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,999
Are you okay about this?

90
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:21,874
I will give it my best.

91
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,037
I expect nothing less.

92
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:34,820
Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

93
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:35,949
Good morning.

94
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,491
My name is Tariq Ali
and first I will read

95
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:44,226
from a prepared
statement and after that

96
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,166
I will take the questions.

97
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:53,837
At approximately
7:15am on the 10th of July

98
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:57,740
armed police fired upon a
suspected suicide bomber

99
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,779
as he attempted to
board a north-bound train

100
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,747
at Charing Cross tube station.

101
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:08,021
No officers or bystanders
were injured, but the suspect

102
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:09,715
Baqir Hassan.
- Could you spell that please?

103
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:12,589
B-A-Q-I-R H-A-S-S-A-N.

104
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:14,525
Baqir Hassan was
killed after he refused

105
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:17,599
to comply with a
lawful order to surrender.

106
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:21,000
The investigation is
currently ongoing and

107
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:25,070
more information will be made
available to you at a later date.

108
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:26,197
Thank you.

109
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:27,604
Sir? Sir?

110
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:31,878
Declan Quinn, from The Informer.
Is it true that the suspect

111
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:33,607
had ties to Al Qaeda?

112
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:36,540
There is no evidence to
support that as yet, but we are

113
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,914
definitely not ruling out
anything at this juncture.

114
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,185
John Clark, Five News. Several
witnesses from the station

115
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,657
stated that the victim did
not respond to police commands

116
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,092
because he was
unable to hear them?

117
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:51,632
As I said before, the
investigation is ongoing.

118
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:53,959
Yes, miss?
- Pamela Davis, News Daily.

119
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:55,897
What do you say to the
victim's mother's claim that

120
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:58,096
her son wasn't a terrorist,
but was a victim of

121
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:00,229
institutional
racism by the police?

122
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:02,198
Every mother would
like to believe the best

123
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:06,643
of her own child. However,
all our hearts do go out to her

124
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:07,770
at this time.

125
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:10,111
The fact that the
suspect was Muslim played

126
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:11,945
no part in his being targeted?

127
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:15,916
We are waging war
on terrorists, Miss.

128
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:17,047
That is who we are targeting.

129
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:18,180
But, he was a Muslim.

130
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:20,248
As am I, Miss Davies.

131
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:24,660
Is it your contention that
all Muslims are terrorists?

132
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:26,762
Obviously not.
- What does that mean?

133
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,090
What does that mean?

134
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,996
Ladies and gentlemen,
that will be all for today.

135
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:34,264
The liaison officer will
have printed copies of

136
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:36,704
the statement for all of you.
Thank you for coming.

137
00:11:38,877 --> 00:11:40,209
Very impressive, Commander.

138
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:42,670
I dare say I couldn't
have done better myself.

139
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:45,809
High praise, indeed.

140
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,685
Here you are,
Isabi, the fresh stock.

141
00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:03,225
Enjoy cooking.
See you next time.

142
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:04,731
Thank you, bhai jaan (dear brother).

143
00:12:11,742 --> 00:12:17,146
You, again? Listen, officer.
This is harassment.

144
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:19,808
Don't you have anything
better to do, then trouble

145
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:20,941
an honest shopkeeper?

146
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:27,721
You call these prices honest?

147
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:34,853
Officer, can I please
offer you something?

148
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:41,727
Some masala chai (spiced tea).

149
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:44,168
Assalum aleikum
- Aleikum.

150
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:53,978
You know, Rabiya gets our
favourite chai masala from Lahore.

151
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,107
Bade Miyan?

152
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:57,241
Bade Miyan.
- Oh, no wonder.

153
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:01,116
I saw the press conference.

154
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,756
Hmm-huh. And?

155
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:07,752
Come on. I thought
it went quite well.

156
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,028
Who's heading the investigation?

157
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:11,824
No officials announcements, yet.

158
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:15,769
Commander sahib (sir), there
are no blooming cameras here.

159
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:20,906
I'm sorry. I really don't know.
The brass on the top floor

160
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,773
don't believe in sharing their
thoughts with a lowly Commander.

161
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:25,806
Especially, a Muslim one.

162
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:29,840
Yunus, I'm having a
good day, don't ruin it.

163
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,110
I'm going to run. It's dinner time.

164
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,711
Oh, don't forget the special
meat for begum sahib (wife).

165
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:36,153
Hey, bless you.

166
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,057
Hi.
- Dad.

167
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:49,230
Oh, hey. Hey.

168
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:54,865
You're gettin' heavy. Gonna
have to stop feeding you so much.

169
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:57,204
Is it okay if I have
dinner at Zaheer's tonight?

170
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:58,801
That's okay. Where is mom?

171
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:01,973
All right, off you go.

172
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:03,105
Brilliant.

173
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:05,343
Hey, hey, champ.
You're forgetting something.

174
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:07,946
Thanks, Dad.
- Bye.

175
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:52,056
Dinner will be
ready in half an hour.

176
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:54,989
What are you cooking?

177
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:56,291
Koftahs (meatballs).

178
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,335
Oh, great. Smells divine.
Got some mutton.

179
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:00,802
Oh?
Put it in the fridge, would you?

180
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:01,929
All righty.

181
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:03,197
Where is Zara?

182
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:05,975
She's at Vrinda's.
You promised she could stay over.

183
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:10,878
Oh, yes. Of course,
a house free of children.

184
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:15,552
Does that give you any ideas?

185
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:17,411
We'll have to be quick.

186
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:21,280
My husband's coming home
soon and he's a policeman.

187
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:26,125
Oh... you're worth the risk.

188
00:15:27,031 --> 00:15:29,158
Oh, there's a letter for you.
I think it's from papa.

189
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:30,456
This one?

190
00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:53,914
Huh? Zaheer is coming
here the day after tomorrow.

191
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:58,060
Look at you, the proud uncle.

192
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:02,455
My nephew, the engineer.
I like the sound of that.

193
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,397
Hello.

194
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,435
Yeah.

195
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:21,072
Where's she now?

196
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:24,409
Oh, all right. All right.

197
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,612
I'll be right over.
I'll be right over.

198
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:28,947
What is it?

199
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:53,971
Can I help you, sir?

200
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,105
Yeah...
- It's okay.

201
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:56,477
Ruby.
Thank you for calling.

202
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:57,914
Sorry about the hour, sir.

203
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,043
No, I should be the one apologising.

204
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,177
Follow me.

205
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:06,650
Rave parties.
Different location every night usually.

206
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,827
Abandoned buildings or vacant lots.

207
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,861
It's very big with teenagers right now.
They think it's retro.

208
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,592
Anyway, somebody called to
complain about the noise

209
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,533
and we managed to grab
a few of them before

210
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,265
they did a runner.
- Drugs?

211
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:21,998
Yes.

212
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,003
Little marijuana, some ecstasy.

213
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,135
Yeah.

214
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,673
If it's any consolation,
she does seem very, very sorry.

215
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,507
So am I.

216
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:51,566
I was here when they brought her in.

217
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:54,130
No one else knows who she is.
No reason they should.

218
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,036
I appreciate that, Ruby.

219
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,165
Where did you think she was?

220
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:00,534
Sleeping over at a friend's place.

221
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:04,038
Classics never go
out of style, do they?

222
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:11,051
Does mum know? Great.

223
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:15,584
I'm sorry, Zara.
But I can't lie to mum

224
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:17,250
with the same
ease as you can, yeah.

225
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:19,520
It was just a party.
It's not like I killed someone.

226
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,258
Just a party?
Just look at the way you're dressed.

227
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:29,063
Who else was at this party?

228
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,173
You expect me to
tell on my friends

229
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:33,436
as if it isn't bad
enough having a cop for a dad.

230
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:37,036
Was that guy Shawn there?
Hmm?

231
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:39,072
Was Shawn there?

232
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:44,020
Look, Zara.
We've talked about this.

233
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:45,382
You are not to see that guy again.

234
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:47,080
You are not to see that guy again!

235
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:48,615
Why?

236
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:54,024
You are much too young to
have a serious boyfriend.

237
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,030
Are you joking? In fact,
some girls

238
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:58,566
are married at my age.
- Come on, Zara.

239
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:00,033
We both know the real
reason why you don't like it.

240
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:01,467
I have no idea what
you talking about.

241
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:02,595
So then tell me this then, dad.

242
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:04,171
Would you be so up in arms

243
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:06,103
about me dating if my
boyfriend was named Salman.

244
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:10,471
You're grounded. All right?
Four weeks.

245
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,672
You're grounded four weeks.
No phone.

246
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:15,208
No television.
No computers, except for homework.

247
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:17,046
And you are coming
straight home from school.

248
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:19,143
Four weeks!
That's so unfair.

249
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:22,712
Unfair.
You want to talk about unfair?

250
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:24,554
Do you realise what this
could have meant for me?

251
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,185
Can you see the headlines?

252
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:30,798
Police Commander's
daughter arrested in drugs raid.

253
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,157
That would have been great
for my career, wouldn't it?

254
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,264
Sure, because it's always
about you dad, isn't it?

255
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:50,177
Our daughter hates me.

256
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:54,143
If that were true, she wouldn't
try so hard to get your attention.

257
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:27,777
Tariq, I was wondering...
Oh, I didn't know. I'll come back.

258
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:36,586
Yes, sir?

259
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,185
Apologies, there was
no one on reception.

260
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:40,194
My door is always open to you, sir.

261
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,290
Please, Daniel will do just fine.

262
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:45,431
Oh, all right. Daniel.

263
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:47,134
I'm on my way out for a walk.

264
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,831
I was wondering if
you'd care to join me?

265
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:53,177
No.
I promised Susan, I'd quit.

266
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:58,141
My wife thinks I quit a year ago,
so I change out of uniform

267
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,617
before going home so
she won't notice the smell.

268
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:04,346
You sure, I can't.

269
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:07,288
No. I lack your
skills at subterfuge.

270
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:10,158
I sometimes find a
little white lie

271
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:12,354
less harmful than harsh reality.

272
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,332
The media are having a
real go over this incident.

273
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,162
You know what they'd print
if we allowed a suspect

274
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:22,239
to walk onto a crowded
train and detonate a device.

275
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:25,732
M.E.T. fails to prevent attack.

276
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:29,208
Damned if we do,
doubly so if we don't.

277
00:21:31,282 --> 00:21:33,340
When will the I.P.C.C.
submit its report?

278
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:38,179
Who knows? Months, weeks.
The wheels of bureaucracy

279
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:40,586
turn very slowly.

280
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:44,692
We just have to weather
the storm then, won't we?

281
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,271
Tariq, we can't stand idle and

282
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:58,002
let the media vultures
villify us in the public eye.

283
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:02,199
The Commissioner and I
have decided to task our own

284
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:05,213
internal inquiry.
I need someone who is not

285
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:08,216
directly involved with
bulldog and someone to liaise with

286
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:11,219
the I.P.C.C., go
through the case evidence

287
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:13,720
interview the family, make
sure there were no blunders

288
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:15,221
on our part and if there were,
make doubly sure

289
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:17,815
that those
responsible are held accountable.

290
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:19,618
Me?

291
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:22,219
Exactly. I am certain that
your findings will not be

292
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,425
coloured by any
misguided loyalties.

293
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:28,236
And it doesn't hurt to have a
Muslim investigating officer

294
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:29,735
does it?

295
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:31,737
The thought never occurred to me.

296
00:22:36,344 --> 00:22:40,247
If I agree to do this, I'll
need an assistant, an officer

297
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:42,839
of my choosing.

298
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:44,975
Whatever you need.

299
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:48,579
There's something else.

300
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:55,251
I've heard a rumour that
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Cole

301
00:22:55,362 --> 00:22:57,991
might be retiring soon?

302
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:00,323
You're very well informed.

303
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:05,271
Requirements in a senior
officer even more so than

304
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:07,772
a Deputy Assistant Commissioner
of police don't you I think.

305
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:16,280
When I was a young
constable you could wander

306
00:23:16,383 --> 00:23:19,284
all over this park and never see

307
00:23:19,385 --> 00:23:21,616
a single non-caucasian face.

308
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:27,354
Britain has changed.
I like to think for the better.

309
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:34,297
We need to reflect that.
We need officers who understand

310
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,527
the complexities of a
multi-cultural Britain.

311
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:38,994
We need officers like you.

312
00:23:40,873 --> 00:23:43,307
Bring me a favourable
result to this inquiry and

313
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:46,310
I have a strong feeling this
department is going to see

314
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:49,939
its first Asian Deputy
Assistant Commissioner.

315
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,323
I don't know if I'll recognise him.
I saw him last when

316
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:02,450
he was just a child.

317
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:17,902
That could be him there.
The backpack the guy with the backpack.

318
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:24,911
Hey, Zaheer.

319
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,406
Mamu (Uncle).

320
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,042
Oh, that is him all right.

321
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:32,013
Excuse me. Uncle.

322
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:38,024
Welcome to London, beta (son).

323
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:39,486
Thank you.

324
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:40,620
You're looking just like your mum.

325
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:41,754
I hope not, for her sake.

326
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:44,024
Your Mami (Aunty).

327
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,362
Mami. Assalum aleikum
(peace be upon you).

328
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:46,492
Aleikum assalum (and upon you too).

329
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:49,036
Mashallah (Wow), your
pictures don't do you justice.

330
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:52,641
Oh, what a charmer.
It's very nice to meet you.

331
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:53,371
Same here.

332
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:55,035
Oh, Mamu (uncle). You shouldn't.
- Oh. Come on, pal.

333
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,773
Is this your first
time abroad, Zaheer?

334
00:24:58,481 --> 00:25:01,110
No, I went to Saudi Arabia
last year for my Umrah (Festival).

335
00:25:01,452 --> 00:25:03,385
Oh, I would have loved
to have gone to Mecca

336
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:05,751
during my backpacking years.

337
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:07,379
My dear, I told you
they wouldn't even

338
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,424
allow you in there.

339
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:10,716
Why not?

340
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:11,851
What?

341
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:12,985
I'm not a Muslim.

342
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:16,926
You should have listened to
me when I told you to convert.

343
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:18,898
Oh, shut up.
Don't start that again.

344
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:21,469
Dekha bhi (see), never
marry a gori (white girl).

345
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,461
Oh, God.

346
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,667
Mamu, thank you once again for
your recommendation letters.

347
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,801
It's all right, beta (son).

348
00:25:29,911 --> 00:25:31,071
I don't know how you did it.
You are a miracle worker.

349
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:33,511
Yes, I am. Though, your
Mami (aunt) might not agree.

350
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,413
But just concentrate on your
studies, get your degree

351
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:38,509
that will be all
the thanks I need.

352
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,424
And in sports news.
Footballer and underwear model

353
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:47,426
Carlos Vieira can now
add best-selling author

354
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:50,498
to his list of achievements.
His autobiography

355
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,090
'My Night on the Ball'
debuted on the London

356
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,432
booksellers' charts this week.
The beloved, tall and athletic

357
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,437
midfielder will be doing a
book signing tour in support

358
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:00,439
of the tour beginning at
the Galleria shopping centre

359
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,475
on the 24th of July.

360
00:26:02,576 --> 00:26:03,600
Yes.

361
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:11,448
'... on the outside in
towards Kuka coming in here'

362
00:26:11,552 --> 00:26:14,111
'and the ball is...'

363
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:20,490
'The fact that Lesotto has
felt it at one end. Perhaps...'

364
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:22,059
Zara, they're back.

365
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:27,523
It's lovely.

366
00:26:27,635 --> 00:26:29,499
Oh, Mamu. Give it to me.
- Oh, not a problem at all.

367
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:30,993
Thank you.

368
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,133
Welcome.

369
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:39,472
Thank you, Mamu.

370
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:47,912
It's not large, but...

371
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:52,723
No, it's perfect.
Mashallah.

372
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:54,820
Well, make yourself at home.

373
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:55,952
Thank you.

374
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:26,615
Ever heard of knocking?

375
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:29,852
I did. Mind coming
down to meet your cousin?

376
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:32,660
I'm grounded, remember?

377
00:27:32,763 --> 00:27:35,664
"Straight to school,
straight to my room, no exceptions."

378
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:38,098
Your words, not mine.

379
00:27:41,872 --> 00:27:43,703
Dinner will be ready in
half an hour. See you there.

380
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:45,867
Yes, Commander.

381
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:25,637
Aleikum assalum.

382
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:15,752
Good morning, sir.

383
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,194
You've heard?

384
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,670
Lieutenant's poster-boy is
leading the investigation.

385
00:29:26,773 --> 00:29:29,241
That bum has cut me
completely out of the loop.

386
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:32,140
He's going to put all
this on our shoulders.

387
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:33,837
We followed protocol.

388
00:29:33,947 --> 00:29:37,643
Oh, wake up, man. Nobody cares.
This isn't about protocol.

389
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:40,049
It's about politics.

390
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,651
Somebody's head is going
to hit the chopping block

391
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:44,848
to sate the public.
You mark my word.

392
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:47,716
Well, just have to keep an
eye on him then, won't we?

393
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:50,728
And how do we do that?
Crystal ball?

394
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,829
I guess, you didn't
hear the full story.

395
00:29:58,103 --> 00:30:00,664
The Commander has acquired
himself a little helper.

396
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:07,676
You must be hungry.
I know an excellent

397
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:09,406
kebab wallah (vendor) close by.

398
00:30:09,781 --> 00:30:12,682
Come on. Why do you insist
on rotting your insides

399
00:30:12,784 --> 00:30:15,310
with that rubbish.
Rabya, you're such a good cook.

400
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,946
Oh, well, one man's
rubbish is another man's cuisine.

401
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:20,756
Still thinking with
your stomach, Yunus?

402
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,894
Well, it rarely leads me astray.

403
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,153
Assalum aleikum.

404
00:30:26,264 --> 00:30:27,288
Aleikum assalum, sir.

405
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:28,694
Tariq, you are looking well.

406
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,700
Thank you, Junaid miya (brother).
But you're a bit far away

407
00:30:31,803 --> 00:30:34,236
from your own pack.
What happened?

408
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:36,772
Did you overstay your
welcome in your own mosque?

409
00:30:38,242 --> 00:30:42,440
On the contrary, I am
now it's Imam (leader).

410
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,711
You should visit us on Friday.
It's not as fancy as this

411
00:30:46,817 --> 00:30:49,945
but still, a place of worship.

412
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:57,727
Saw you on telly.
New spokesperson of

413
00:30:57,828 --> 00:31:00,956
the police department.
You must be so proud.

414
00:31:01,063 --> 00:31:02,088
Shall we?
- Yes.

415
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,393
Who have we here?

416
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,957
Oh, this is my nephew,
Zaheer, Ismat appa's (sister) son.

417
00:31:08,104 --> 00:31:10,095
This is Juniad miya, Tariq
and I know him from Lahore.

418
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:11,330
Assalum aleikum.

419
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,241
Aleikum assalum, young man.
Mashallah. The last I saw you

420
00:31:16,345 --> 00:31:17,744
you were crawling on
your mother's floor.

421
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:19,178
And look at you now.

422
00:31:20,783 --> 00:31:22,216
How are you finding London so far?

423
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,177
A bit intimidating.

424
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:26,414
Don't worry puttar (son), everything
is going to be fine. Come.

425
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:28,820
We have a study group
that meets every Sunday.

426
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:31,755
A bit out of the way for you,
but it might be

427
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:33,851
a good way for you
to make new friends.

428
00:31:33,963 --> 00:31:36,090
Zaheer, I'm running
late for an appointment.

429
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:37,222
Yes, Uncle.

430
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,493
I appreciate the offer,
but I have a lot on my plate.

431
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:41,293
Khuda Hafiz (good bye).

432
00:31:41,403 --> 00:31:42,427
Khuda Hafiz.

433
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:45,301
If you change your mind,
our doors are always open.

434
00:31:46,174 --> 00:31:47,301
Darn shoe thief.

435
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:48,774
Remember, he was
caught stealing shoes at

436
00:31:48,877 --> 00:31:50,242
Badshah-Id mosque in Lahore?

437
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:55,782
My brother was not a terrorist.
He only moved to London

438
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:59,512
six months ago. He was
going to be an artist.

439
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:12,299
You know, if he met
anyone recently in college.

440
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,526
Someone who might
have been suspicious?

441
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:16,903
He didn't have time for friends.

442
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:19,803
He studied all week,
then came home on weekends

443
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:21,841
to help with the store.

444
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:26,808
Oh, this is total bollocks.
Baqir was never a suicide bomber

445
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:30,906
and you know it. You're just
here trying to cover your own backs.

446
00:32:34,388 --> 00:32:38,882
Look, I assure you. We're only
trying to find out the truth.

447
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,983
Sure. Well, excuse me.

448
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,942
This interview is terminated.

449
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,447
And you are?

450
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,916
Fiona Monroe.
I represent the Hassan family.

451
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,851
Any questions for
them in the future

452
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:12,856
go through me or my office

453
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:13,982
or in an interview
at the police station.

454
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,925
Hold on. No one is
being investigated here.

455
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,257
Perhaps, someone should be.

456
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:20,865
My clients are the victims here.
I don't want to be badgered

457
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:23,059
or harassed by your department.

458
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:26,262
Look, we're not adversaries. We
both want the same thing here.

459
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:32,167
I sincerely doubt that. Goodbye,
officers. I'll see you in court.

460
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,021
What a lovely woman.

461
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:56,957
Praise the Lord.

462
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,900
For hundreds of years, the star
of Islam is shining in the world

463
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,905
because of khilafa (caliphate).

464
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:05,907
Brothers, the establishment
of khilafa is

465
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:08,204
an Islamic duty.

466
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:11,647
But khilafa means imposing shariat
(Koran's code of law) on everyone.

467
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,349
What if we live in a
non-Muslim democracy?

468
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:19,013
No, brother. Khilafa as a
duty is confirmed in the Koran.

469
00:34:19,122 --> 00:34:20,589
The sunnah (trodden path)
of the prophet

470
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:21,917
peace be upon him, the consensus

471
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:23,049
of the shaba (code of conduct)

472
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:24,182
and shariat principle
and it's your duty

473
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:26,660
to change this
system of the khafa.

474
00:34:27,964 --> 00:34:29,021
What's your name, brother?

475
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:30,994
Abdullah.
- Alhamdalila.

476
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:39,005
What's Abdullah? Abdullah
means slave of Allah. Subanatallah.

477
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:42,942
Now, can a Muslim
subscribe to any of the freedoms

478
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:44,945
mentioned in a
democratic charter

479
00:34:45,047 --> 00:34:47,015
and be a Muslim in the true sense?

480
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:48,140
No.

481
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:54,381
No, my brother. A slave of
Allah cannot serve two masters.

482
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:59,389
Join our study circle.
Serve the cause of Allah.

483
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:25,481
Welcome all. You have
grown again. Look at you.

484
00:35:27,687 --> 00:35:30,486
Hello, darling. Tariq.

485
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,388
Hello. That's my nephew Zaheer.

486
00:35:32,492 --> 00:35:33,982
Hello.
- Please come in.

487
00:35:34,094 --> 00:35:36,063
How lovely you all look.

488
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:38,793
And you get bigger every week.

489
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,726
Come in. Come in.
Everyone's in the garden.

490
00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:59,744
'Happy birthday to you.'

491
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,146
'Happy birthday to you'.

492
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:12,094
Yeah.

493
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:14,756
He's a handsome young man.

494
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:16,601
Like uncle, like nephew.

495
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:18,433
Makes a nice pair with Zara.

496
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,129
Perhaps, there will be
wedding bells in the family soon.

497
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:24,299
Yeah, but they're
first cousins, aren't they?

498
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:28,103
So are Yunus and I. It is
acceptable in our culture.

499
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:30,113
As a matter of fact,
it's even preferred.

500
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,173
Excuse me.

501
00:36:35,086 --> 00:36:36,212
Was it something I said?

502
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:40,124
I say, deport them all.
The faster, the better.

503
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:44,120
I have to say I'm shocked
to hear you say that, Yunus.

504
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:47,725
Every time someone like
Abu Hamsa or Sheikh Omar Bahkri

505
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,061
appear in front of television
camera, things become worse

506
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:52,328
for my family, for my business.

507
00:36:53,438 --> 00:36:55,064
They just open their mouth,
half of England thinks that

508
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:57,300
they speak for all the Muslims.

509
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:01,077
I mean, you should see some
of the things spray-painted

510
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,339
outside my store. Who
needs the aggravations?

511
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,077
I think your son
has dreams of being

512
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:07,115
the next Beckham, Mamu.

513
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:09,582
That's good. He can
support me in my old age.

514
00:37:10,386 --> 00:37:13,413
What do you make of this
radical Imam situation, Zaheer?

515
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,655
Yunus seems to think, we
should deport them all.

516
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:17,192
Let them be somebody else's problem.

517
00:37:18,227 --> 00:37:19,285
I don't really know
much about it, sir.

518
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,161
Well, you read the newspapers.
You must have some opinion.

519
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:26,100
Well, I think there is a fine
line between being a terrorist and

520
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,500
a freedom fighter.

521
00:37:28,604 --> 00:37:31,437
Rubbish. They preach
hatred and violence.

522
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,133
There is nothing
honourable about them.

523
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:36,111
It wasn't long ago
before Nelson Mandela

524
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,112
was called a terrorist
and then Menachem Begin

525
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,114
he was a part of Irgun,
the group identified

526
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,445
by the Brits as
a terrorist outfit.

527
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,109
And then later, when he
became a Prime Minister

528
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,811
he was called a peacemaker.

529
00:37:46,154 --> 00:37:48,622
Okay, two exceptions
don't make a rule.

530
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,591
I guess that depends on
who is making the rules.

531
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:54,628
Come on, come on. What are
we getting so serious about?

532
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:56,525
I thought this was a birthday party.

533
00:37:57,832 --> 00:38:00,823
Yeah. Sorry, Mamu,
I meant no offence.

534
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:03,636
Never apologise for
your opinions, my boy.

535
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:05,395
Leave that to the politicians.

536
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:07,833
And to the police Commanders.

537
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:19,878
Assalum aleikum, brother Abdullah.
Brothers, repeat after me.

538
00:38:25,492 --> 00:38:28,791
In the name of Allah, most
gracious, most merciful.

539
00:38:29,196 --> 00:38:32,427
In the name of Allah, most
gracious, most merciful.

540
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:36,264
Peace. Assalum aleikum, brothers.

541
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:38,266
Aleikum assalum.

542
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:45,510
I am so happy to see
you all here. Brothers

543
00:38:45,613 --> 00:38:49,845
before I say anything,
I urge you to ask me a question

544
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:52,315
which you yourself
find difficult to answer.

545
00:38:53,953 --> 00:38:55,181
Brother Abdullah.

546
00:38:57,523 --> 00:39:00,685
A movement to create
khilafa will lead to bloodshed.

547
00:39:00,793 --> 00:39:02,192
Innocent people are going to die

548
00:39:02,295 --> 00:39:04,729
and Islam does not condone
the killings of innocent people.

549
00:39:05,964 --> 00:39:09,263
So how do we achieve
khilafa without violence?

550
00:39:14,906 --> 00:39:18,205
Brother, you are right.
Islam does not teach

551
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:21,211
killing innocent people. So
now tell me, who is innocent

552
00:39:21,314 --> 00:39:23,247
and who is not?

553
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:26,212
Those who kill Palestinian men,
women and children

554
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:28,286
are they innocent?

555
00:39:28,387 --> 00:39:29,411
No.

556
00:39:29,655 --> 00:39:32,714
Those who invaded Iraq,
Afghanistan, Chechnya

557
00:39:32,824 --> 00:39:35,952
and killed thousands of
Muslims in their own backyards.

558
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,484
Are they innocent?

559
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:38,620
No.

560
00:39:38,729 --> 00:39:41,391
Those who throw cluster
bombs on unarmed civilians

561
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,230
those who use tanks
and bulldozers against

562
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:45,894
pregnant women and children.

563
00:39:46,003 --> 00:39:47,493
Are they innocent?
- No.

564
00:39:47,606 --> 00:39:49,972
Those who despise you
because you are Muslims.

565
00:39:50,574 --> 00:39:54,237
Those who deny you equality,
jobs, visas

566
00:39:54,344 --> 00:39:57,246
because of your religion.
Are they innocent?

567
00:39:57,347 --> 00:39:58,372
No.

568
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:01,917
If they are not innocent, if
they are perpetrators or allies of

569
00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:05,318
the perpetrators, then
they are at war with you.

570
00:40:05,956 --> 00:40:07,923
And you are at war
with them, brothers.

571
00:40:10,026 --> 00:40:11,255
Allah o akbar
(Allah is the greatest).

572
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:13,724
Allah o akbar.

573
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:22,995
Zaheer, I...
Oh, I'm sorry to disturb you.

574
00:40:23,306 --> 00:40:24,933
I was hoping you
might do me a big favour.

575
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,269
How can I help?

576
00:40:26,375 --> 00:40:28,776
Well, I have to pop out to the
shops and do various things

577
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:30,277
and I was wondering if you
wouldn't mind picking up

578
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:32,541
Imran from football practice,

579
00:40:33,382 --> 00:40:34,679
Sure, Mami. Not a problem.

580
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:35,947
Thank you.

581
00:40:55,637 --> 00:40:56,661
All right, darling.

582
00:40:58,474 --> 00:40:59,498
Should we have a word?

583
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,302
No. Let's just do
what we came here for.

584
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,567
Say cheese.

585
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:07,314
Don't get involved in
anything you don't have to.

586
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:08,439
Yeah. But...

587
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,573
Just don't get involved in anything.

588
00:41:13,421 --> 00:41:16,015
Oh, hell. How do you stand it?

589
00:41:16,657 --> 00:41:17,919
Few more years and
you won't even notice.

590
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:19,390
Smell like morning on the hay.

591
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,529
Not bloody likely. It's
not another domestic, is it?

592
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:25,523
Complaint of loud
noises and strange odour

593
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:26,930
coming from the third floor flat.

594
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,458
How would you notice?

595
00:41:32,105 --> 00:41:34,073
Right. Smell anything?

596
00:41:35,008 --> 00:41:37,068
Only your aftershave.
Pat the paint brush, did you?

597
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:39,877
Oh, cheeky witch. Just
for that you get to knock.

598
00:41:44,384 --> 00:41:45,408
Yeah?

599
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:46,952
Police, sir. Can we have a word?

600
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:51,353
Police! Open the door, now!

601
00:41:56,897 --> 00:41:57,921
Yeah?

602
00:41:58,031 --> 00:41:59,362
P.C. Andrews. This is P.C. Miller.

603
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:01,366
We've had a complaint
about a strange odour.

604
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:04,401
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
It must've been spicy food.

605
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,932
Anyone else in the flat, sir?

606
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,098
No. No one else.

607
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:09,805
Yeah. I thought I heard voices.

608
00:42:11,477 --> 00:42:14,810
It's just the telly.

609
00:42:14,915 --> 00:42:15,938
Look, I'm sorry, but I've
got something on the stove.

610
00:42:16,048 --> 00:42:17,106
So, can I just...
Hey, who's that?

611
00:42:22,154 --> 00:42:23,382
On the floor.

612
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:27,122
I've got him. Check
the other room. Go.

613
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,023
Hey, Stop!

614
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,754
Bollocks.

615
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:35,431
There's another one.
Jumped out the blooming window.

616
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,500
Must an acrobat or something.
I swear.

617
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:38,828
All right. Just check the kitchen.

618
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:44,832
Darn!

619
00:42:46,578 --> 00:42:47,602
Good evening.
- Good evening.

620
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:51,138
Hello.

621
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:52,949
Hey.
- Hi.

622
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:54,541
Gang's all here.

623
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:55,676
Yeah.

624
00:42:56,588 --> 00:42:57,612
Hello.

625
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:01,549
Maybe I should call home and
check if the kids are all right.

626
00:43:02,092 --> 00:43:03,992
Oh, relax, Susan. They'll be fine.

627
00:43:04,194 --> 00:43:06,425
Last time you said that,
you spent the night

628
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:08,462
bailing out our
daughter from the lock up.

629
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,693
Zaheer is there.
He'll look after them.

630
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:14,494
Here's my boss. Smile.

631
00:43:14,771 --> 00:43:16,432
And his lovely wife.

632
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,998
Susan. Hello, how are you?
How long has it been?

633
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,169
Tariq. How was your trip up north?

634
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:24,976
Go on, shop talk.
Come on. Let's mingle.

635
00:43:27,817 --> 00:43:30,183
Two glasses of champagne,
you can't take her anywhere.

636
00:43:30,553 --> 00:43:31,611
So, the interview...

637
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:34,520
Sure. The family
have retained a lawyer.

638
00:43:36,225 --> 00:43:37,454
Nothing surprising there.

639
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,724
Her name's Fiona
Monroe and she is trouble.

640
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:43,522
Most women are.

641
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:45,591
Sir.

642
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:46,725
No, thank you.

643
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:02,774
No.
- Why not?

644
00:44:03,218 --> 00:44:05,152
We're in your mum's car
outside my parents' house

645
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:06,743
where I'm supposed
to be babysitting.

646
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:08,146
What else do you need?

647
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:10,047
What about my room?
My mum's passed out.

648
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:12,886
I'm not ready. Be patient.

649
00:44:13,528 --> 00:44:15,553
But that's what you said
last month and the month before.

650
00:44:17,532 --> 00:44:18,793
You're such a wanker sometimes.

651
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,494
Wait, wait. I'm sorry,
okay? It wasn't me.

652
00:44:21,602 --> 00:44:22,831
It was the other part talking.

653
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:29,508
You know I love you,
right? Forgive me. Right?

654
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:31,568
Still a wanker.

655
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:32,704
Yeah, well, whose fault's that?

656
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:34,007
Ew, Mark.

657
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:09,076
A little after your curfew,
isn't it, Mr?

658
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:11,283
Sorry, ma'am. It won't happen again.

659
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,642
See that it doesn't.

660
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,055
By the way, I...
I think you missed a few buttons.

661
00:45:18,023 --> 00:45:19,047
Bugger.

662
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:37,234
Look at that. He's got his head
so far up the Deputy's behind,

663
00:45:37,342 --> 00:45:38,969
I'm surprised he can still breathe.

664
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,635
You're jealous.

665
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,307
Any word on the
interview with the family?

666
00:45:43,682 --> 00:45:44,705
I should know something tomorrow.

667
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:46,107
See that you do.

668
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,597
Sure, retard.

669
00:46:09,073 --> 00:46:11,234
Daniel, could I have a word?

670
00:46:11,642 --> 00:46:12,836
John, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

671
00:46:12,943 --> 00:46:16,070
I was hoping we might discuss the
Deputy Assistant Commissioner post.

672
00:46:17,714 --> 00:46:20,080
Come on, now. This is
neither the time nor the place.

673
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:49,367
Susan, we got a serious problem.
I have to go. You'll be all right?

674
00:46:49,745 --> 00:46:51,077
Don't worry about me. Go.

675
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:59,080
Sir, we're required at
headquarters immediately.

676
00:46:59,188 --> 00:47:01,088
Suspected terrorist activity.
One arrest.

677
00:47:05,961 --> 00:47:09,920
Darling, there's a situation
that requires my presence elsewhere.

678
00:47:10,364 --> 00:47:13,391
I'll send the driver to take
you back home. Good night.

679
00:47:17,772 --> 00:47:18,796
John. Harry.

680
00:47:29,784 --> 00:47:33,151
He doesn't even look worried.
As if he's waiting for a bus.

681
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:37,288
Well, you've really
stepped in it this time, Aziz.

682
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:40,186
Until now, it's just
been little stuff.

683
00:47:40,995 --> 00:47:42,826
A little bit of benefit fraud.

684
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:46,698
A bit of petty theft.

685
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:54,071
And now look at you. All grown up
from playing the proper villain.

686
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:56,872
A regular Osama in the making.

687
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:01,372
I believe the suspect
finds me funny, Diesco.

688
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:03,375
I believe you're right, sir.

689
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,450
Is that it, Aziz? What
do you think I'm funny?

690
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:09,717
Well, you'll find
this hysterical then.

691
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,787
Know what the sentence is

692
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:13,381
for committing an act of
terrorism on British soil?

693
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:20,322
Life imprisonment, no parole.
30 years, mate.

694
00:48:21,934 --> 00:48:23,800
Should get out just in
time to collect your pension.

695
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,294
That is, of course,
unless we pack you up

696
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:27,736
and ship you back to rugged land.

697
00:48:33,512 --> 00:48:35,035
I've got a bad idea, actually.

698
00:48:35,848 --> 00:48:38,248
Why should we have the
expense of putting you up?

699
00:48:39,518 --> 00:48:42,748
Maybe, we should just
give you to the Americans.

700
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:49,252
I've been there,
you know. Guantanamo.

701
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:52,489
I went to interview
this bloke student.

702
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:55,958
Got himself arrested as
a suspected terrorist.

703
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,270
Said he was a British citizen,
supposedly lost his passport.

704
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,771
The poor boy was in tears
practically the entire interview.

705
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:09,771
Told me how the guards used
to make him stand on one leg

706
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:13,282
for 13 hours straight.
And if he fell over

707
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:15,416
he had to start all over again.

708
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:16,978
The look on his face

709
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,081
when I told him there
was nothing I could do.

710
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:27,194
He got down on his knees
and he begged me to kill him.

711
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,924
Can you imagine that?

712
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,833
Do you imagine being so
frightened of a place

713
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:38,842
that you'd rather die
than live there another day?

714
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:45,035
I couldn't. How about you?

715
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:53,348
It doesn't have to be that way
Aziz. Help us and we can help you.

716
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,251
Look, we know there
was another man there.

717
00:49:57,026 --> 00:49:58,823
Help us find him and
I give you my word.

718
00:49:58,928 --> 00:50:00,361
I will do what I can for you.

719
00:50:02,198 --> 00:50:05,565
It's all right. Please.

720
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:12,241
God will strike down
upon his disloyal subjects.

721
00:50:13,008 --> 00:50:15,841
Death to the enemies of Islam.

722
00:50:17,112 --> 00:50:19,580
Darn. I thought we had him.

723
00:50:42,537 --> 00:50:46,200
Oh, Tariq. What's wrong?

724
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,878
It's starting again.

725
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:57,449
Good morning, ladies and gentleman.

726
00:50:57,952 --> 00:50:59,544
On behalf of the Hassan family

727
00:50:59,653 --> 00:51:01,553
I would like to make a
statement to the press.

728
00:51:02,588 --> 00:51:05,558
The department is yet to
produce any credible evidence

729
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:08,593
that Mr. Hassan is linked
to any terrorist activity.

730
00:51:08,929 --> 00:51:11,556
As such, my clients
are going forward with

731
00:51:11,665 --> 00:51:13,256
the wrongful death claim
against the London Police

732
00:51:13,399 --> 00:51:16,163
and in particular, the
officers in charge of the operation.

733
00:51:16,602 --> 00:51:18,126
Azan Hassan lost her son...

734
00:51:18,237 --> 00:51:20,068
due to inept
handling of this incident.

735
00:51:20,606 --> 00:51:22,631
And rightly, well,
someone should be accountable.

736
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:24,909
But why now?
Why not wait

737
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:26,569
for the independent police
complaints commission report?

738
00:51:26,946 --> 00:51:29,175
My clients remain
dubious about the report

739
00:51:29,315 --> 00:51:30,906
or the accuracy of its findings.

740
00:51:31,284 --> 00:51:32,910
They prefer to let the court decide.

741
00:51:33,553 --> 00:51:36,112
My brother was no terrorist.

742
00:51:37,255 --> 00:51:40,486
He was murdered
because he was Muslim.

743
00:51:41,526 --> 00:51:42,550
He was...

744
00:51:42,661 --> 00:51:43,923
That will be all.

745
00:51:44,029 --> 00:51:45,053
Mrs. Hassan...

746
00:51:45,163 --> 00:51:46,994
Can you tell me, why do you think...

747
00:51:47,532 --> 00:51:48,658
Oh, blooming hell.

748
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:50,593
Are you okay?

749
00:51:50,701 --> 00:51:52,602
No, Susan, I'm not. This...

750
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:57,398
I have to go.

751
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:00,938
What's the matter?

752
00:52:01,146 --> 00:52:03,670
Oh, nothing. Aren't
you going to be late?

753
00:52:04,049 --> 00:52:05,948
I didn't sleep very well last night.

754
00:52:06,183 --> 00:52:07,673
Oh, dear. Here.

755
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:11,078
Assalamu Alaikum.

756
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:12,513
Wa Alaikum Assalam.

757
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:15,082
What's happened?

758
00:52:15,593 --> 00:52:18,687
Oh, I fell and twisted my ankle.

759
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,355
Well, is it serious? Do
you want to see a doctor?

760
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:23,967
No, it'll be fine.

761
00:52:25,735 --> 00:52:26,963
So, how did it go last night?

762
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:33,709
Everyone on their best behaviour?

763
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:35,709
Yeah. It was fine.

764
00:52:38,014 --> 00:52:39,039
Good.

765
00:52:44,087 --> 00:52:45,145
This is blooming hopeless.

766
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:49,058
Oh, come on. We've only
got 62 hours left to watch.

767
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:51,517
Bring me a tub of French
Vanilla and some biscuits

768
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:52,720
it will be like my last day off.

769
00:52:54,364 --> 00:52:55,523
I hope I'm not interrupting.

770
00:52:57,032 --> 00:52:58,057
Sorry, sir.

771
00:52:58,201 --> 00:52:59,531
Could you give us a
moment please, constable.

772
00:52:59,669 --> 00:53:00,693
Yes, sir.

773
00:53:08,377 --> 00:53:09,401
So, how's it coming?

774
00:53:09,778 --> 00:53:11,143
A few more eyes wouldn't hurt.

775
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,378
Listen, I'm sorry if I
offended you with that

776
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,542
'shipping back to rugged
land' remark in the interview.

777
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,347
I was just trying to get a rise.

778
00:53:19,721 --> 00:53:22,746
It's okay. But he is from Yorkshire.

779
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:26,594
I understand you were
with Commander Ali...

780
00:53:26,694 --> 00:53:28,253
when he spoke with
the suspect's family.

781
00:53:28,564 --> 00:53:31,555
Baqir Hassan, yeah, we...
We spoke to his mother and sister.

782
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:33,360
About what in particular?

783
00:53:35,137 --> 00:53:39,368
Well, it wouldn't be proper for
me to discuss that with you, sir.

784
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:41,165
You've heard about the claim?

785
00:53:42,143 --> 00:53:43,167
Yes, sir.

786
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:45,203
Strange timing that.

787
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:48,075
The way they came up with the idea
straight after your little visit.

788
00:53:48,548 --> 00:53:49,572
I don't know what you mean, sir.

789
00:53:51,419 --> 00:53:52,681
I'm sure you don't.

790
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:10,660
Gotcha.

791
00:54:14,307 --> 00:54:18,208
She was all over me.
- Bollocks.
- I practically had to fight her off.

792
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,744
It was sore for like two days.

793
00:54:19,845 --> 00:54:21,074
What was it like?

794
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:23,206
Really brilliant. She really
knew what she was doing, yeah?

795
00:54:23,415 --> 00:54:25,111
All Muslim girls have
to wait for marriage.

796
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:26,751
Yeah, well they're not
supposed to eat pork either.

797
00:54:26,852 --> 00:54:28,582
Didn't stop her
swallowing my sausage.

798
00:54:31,123 --> 00:54:32,147
Zara.

799
00:54:35,861 --> 00:54:37,658
So, what was that, then? Foreplay?

800
00:54:43,868 --> 00:54:47,360
That far? About there.

801
00:54:48,207 --> 00:54:49,231
It's about here.

802
00:54:49,475 --> 00:54:51,169
No? A little further, Ruby.

803
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:52,833
Here?

804
00:54:53,746 --> 00:54:54,770
Yeah, that's about right.

805
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,108
What do you reckon, officer?

806
00:54:57,549 --> 00:54:58,573
That's right, sir.

807
00:55:01,487 --> 00:55:02,714
You must be quite a marksman.

808
00:55:03,888 --> 00:55:06,857
Haven't had any complaints,
till now, laddy.

809
00:55:10,495 --> 00:55:13,692
You identify yourself
as a police officer?

810
00:55:14,164 --> 00:55:15,188
No, as a postman.

811
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,197
Yes, sir.

812
00:55:20,305 --> 00:55:21,862
Could you excuse us for
a minute please, officer?

813
00:55:26,244 --> 00:55:28,211
You don't like me much,
do you, Inspector?

814
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:32,141
On the contrary. I have a deep
respect for your position, sir.

815
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:34,308
It's not really the same thing.

816
00:55:36,853 --> 00:55:40,254
So, the train was arriving,
it was rush hour.

817
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:45,894
People pushing, shoving,
talking. Didn't it occur to you

818
00:55:45,928 --> 00:55:47,828
that perhaps the
boy couldn't hear you?

819
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:54,664
Police, put your hands above
your heads and drop to your knees.

820
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:55,894
Do it.

821
00:55:56,872 --> 00:55:58,669
It's all right. It's all right,
folks. Sorry about that.

822
00:56:01,344 --> 00:56:02,902
Did you have any trouble
hearing me, Commander?

823
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:08,682
I have to say, I don't like
your attitude, D.I. Marber.

824
00:56:09,285 --> 00:56:11,515
I don't like being
second guessed, sir.

825
00:56:12,555 --> 00:56:14,784
The suspect turned and
looked me right in the eye.

826
00:56:15,323 --> 00:56:17,814
He saw the gun and he
reached his hand into his jacket.

827
00:56:18,294 --> 00:56:19,453
I saw wires protruding.

828
00:56:20,228 --> 00:56:22,390
I had a second, maybe less,
to make a judgement call.

829
00:56:22,897 --> 00:56:25,195
In the same situation,
I would make it again.

830
00:56:26,234 --> 00:56:27,258
I'm sure you would.

831
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:31,632
How is the view from the
moral high-ground, Commander?

832
00:56:32,774 --> 00:56:34,207
Any skeletons in your cupboard?

833
00:56:35,243 --> 00:56:37,643
Perhaps, sponsorship
letters to a family member.

834
00:56:38,313 --> 00:56:39,802
Issued on an official letterhead?

835
00:56:44,386 --> 00:56:45,944
Ruby, would you mind
getting the car around?

836
00:56:46,253 --> 00:56:47,277
Sure.

837
00:56:50,257 --> 00:56:53,658
You listen to me.
You killed a man here.

838
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,627
A young Muslim boy, not
much older than my nephew.

839
00:56:58,532 --> 00:57:02,229
Right now, I am the only thing that
stands between you and the R.B.C.C.

840
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,864
Perhaps, you should
dispense with the attitude, yeah?

841
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:08,270
I was following orders.

842
00:57:08,409 --> 00:57:10,377
I've heard that rationale before.

843
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:12,977
I wonder if you'd been so
quick to pull the trigger

844
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:14,907
if his skin hadn't been brown.

845
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,277
You think I'm racist.

846
00:57:18,951 --> 00:57:19,975
Yes, I do.

847
00:57:24,557 --> 00:57:28,493
No. No, Commander. I'm a realist.

848
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:30,987
Remember you're
little press conference?

849
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,392
And you gave that
reporter a dressing-down

850
00:57:33,499 --> 00:57:35,990
for intimating that
all Muslims are terrorists.

851
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,800
You see the thing is
she was only half-wrong.

852
00:57:40,672 --> 00:57:43,267
And the question isn't,
are all Muslims, terrorists?

853
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:45,738
It's, are all terrorists, Muslim?

854
00:57:47,312 --> 00:57:49,008
And I think we both
know the answer to that.

855
00:57:57,856 --> 00:57:58,880
Praise the Lord.

856
00:58:22,346 --> 00:58:27,875
In the name of Allah, the
compassionate, the merciful.

857
00:58:29,086 --> 00:58:33,489
Now it has become a routine,
that every Friday

858
00:58:33,591 --> 00:58:36,991
we mourn the deaths of
thousands of innocent Muslims

859
00:58:37,094 --> 00:58:40,393
killed by American,
Israeli and British forces

860
00:58:40,865 --> 00:58:43,833
who have no business
to occupy our lands.

861
00:58:45,035 --> 00:58:49,061
Shame on us. We meet here,
offer salat (prayers)

862
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:53,600
mourn the deaths and forget
everything the very next day.

863
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:59,541
Shame on you, all Muslims of
this land and other lands.

864
00:59:02,551 --> 00:59:06,920
It pains me to refer to the
events of the recent days

865
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:09,613
following the declaration of
war against the Ummah (community).

866
00:59:11,628 --> 00:59:14,858
The Muslims in Iraq, the
Muslims in Afghanistan

867
00:59:15,899 --> 00:59:18,628
the Muslims in Lebanon,
the Muslims in Gaza

868
00:59:19,468 --> 00:59:23,030
the Muslims in Chechnya, the
Muslims in Kashmir and where not.

869
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,901
They have declared a war over
our possessions, our mosques

870
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:32,105
our men, our women, and
our children and our dignity.

871
00:59:33,715 --> 00:59:37,446
The deviant enemies of Islam
have undertaken a new phase

872
00:59:37,553 --> 00:59:40,920
of committing atrocities
against our brothers and sisters.

873
00:59:41,689 --> 00:59:45,591
Their masks have come off.
Their plans have been revealed.

874
00:59:46,427 --> 00:59:52,127
But the wounded body of
crusaders has also become feeble.

875
00:59:53,835 --> 00:59:56,395
And their collapse is inevitable.

876
00:59:58,105 --> 01:00:02,132
Brothers, we must
unite and take revenge.

877
01:00:03,177 --> 01:00:06,509
If it means laying
down our lives, so be it.

878
01:00:13,453 --> 01:00:14,681
Allah o Akbar.

879
01:00:14,988 --> 01:00:16,421
Allah o Akbar.

880
01:00:16,523 --> 01:00:17,820
Allah o Akbar.

881
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:19,425
Allah o Akbar.

882
01:00:19,526 --> 01:00:22,518
Allah o Akbar.
- Allah o Akbar.

883
01:00:22,629 --> 01:00:23,926
Allah o Akbar.

884
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:35,836
Has he gone mad?
I don't believe this.

885
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,936
It's because of people
like him we have to suffer.

886
01:00:40,546 --> 01:00:43,777
Tariq, you people
seem to be in a hurry.

887
01:00:43,984 --> 01:00:45,178
I thought I might have missed you.

888
01:00:45,484 --> 01:00:47,509
Listen, Junaid. Perhaps
this is not the right time.

889
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,445
It won't take a minute.
It's about the Hassan inquiry.

890
01:00:50,623 --> 01:00:51,647
Who are you?

891
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,015
Sorry?

892
01:00:53,792 --> 01:00:57,192
Who are you? The
boy I grew up with

893
01:00:57,496 --> 01:00:58,895
would never spout
such bigotry, such hatred.

894
01:00:59,564 --> 01:01:02,692
I would be well within the law
to arrest you right here, and now.

895
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,096
Always the policeman.
You'll have me beaten as well?

896
01:01:08,173 --> 01:01:11,767
Mamu, please. This is not
the way. They're only words.

897
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,810
Words? This is poison.

898
01:01:14,245 --> 01:01:16,213
What matters is how
we interpret them.

899
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:18,808
Listen to him, Tariq.
He speaks the truth.

900
01:01:19,584 --> 01:01:22,018
I'm sorry if you people
found my speech offensive.

901
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:24,213
It was not my intent. Forgive me.

902
01:01:25,122 --> 01:01:27,114
Mamu, please. Please.

903
01:01:46,643 --> 01:01:50,169
It's me. I think I have
something you're gonna want to see.

904
01:01:54,284 --> 01:01:57,583
Imran! Imran!

905
01:02:02,292 --> 01:02:05,954
Laces. Come here. Nervous?

906
01:02:07,096 --> 01:02:08,120
Sort of.

907
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:10,529
Don't be. You'll
be fine. Just watch.

908
01:02:11,067 --> 01:02:12,193
Everyone's bigger than me.

909
01:02:13,669 --> 01:02:15,864
It's not about size.
It's about speed.

910
01:02:15,972 --> 01:02:18,532
Remember what I
taught you. Go for it.

911
01:02:18,841 --> 01:02:19,865
Come on, Imran.

912
01:02:20,876 --> 01:02:23,538
All right.

913
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:30,545
What's the matter with
you two? Come on, cheer up.

914
01:02:30,752 --> 01:02:32,117
You're supposed to
be supporting Imran.

915
01:02:32,754 --> 01:02:37,920
Come on, Imran. Where are you going?

916
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:39,083
Toilet.

917
01:02:39,194 --> 01:02:40,218
Well, hurry up or you'll miss him.

918
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:44,022
Come on.

919
01:02:45,266 --> 01:02:46,290
Ball away.

920
01:02:58,746 --> 01:03:00,305
Why haven't you
returned any of my calls?

921
01:03:00,649 --> 01:03:02,582
Three guesses and the
first two don't count.

922
01:03:02,683 --> 01:03:04,150
Look. I said I was sorry, all right.

923
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:05,751
I just didn't want
to look like a coward.

924
01:03:05,853 --> 01:03:07,582
What? And make me
look like a prostitute.

925
01:03:07,688 --> 01:03:09,588
Whatever. It's done. We're over.

926
01:03:10,224 --> 01:03:12,021
Ow! - I just want to
talk to you, all right?

927
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:13,650
You're hurting me.
- Why are you being such a witch?

928
01:03:13,761 --> 01:03:14,784
Let her go.

929
01:03:15,028 --> 01:03:16,053
Who are you, then, eh?

930
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:17,320
He's my cousin.

931
01:03:17,631 --> 01:03:19,258
Yeah, piss off, mate.
It doesn't concern you.

932
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:20,594
I said, "Let her go."

933
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:22,025
Darn you.

934
01:03:25,705 --> 01:03:26,729
Are you okay?

935
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,864
I'm fine.

936
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:28,998
Let's go.

937
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,343
Deputy
Commissioner Tennant's office.

938
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:43,781
Well, it looks in order to me.
Am I missing something?

939
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:46,619
This is the tape of the anonymous
caller who phoned in the tip.

940
01:03:49,395 --> 01:03:53,023
Listen, they're up to something.
They're coming. Going.

941
01:03:53,732 --> 01:03:56,633
Do it now. Have to check it out.

942
01:03:57,136 --> 01:04:02,129
The address. 16, Mill Lane Garden.

943
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:03,899
Did you hear that?

944
01:04:04,009 --> 01:04:06,170
Tariq, I am very busy.
I have a meeting in a few minutes.

945
01:04:06,278 --> 01:04:07,836
Look, it won't take a second.
Just listen to it.

946
01:04:08,747 --> 01:04:13,707
The address. 16 Mill Lane Garden.

947
01:04:16,254 --> 01:04:18,051
Did he say Mill Lane Gardens?

948
01:04:24,762 --> 01:04:25,786
The wrong address.

949
01:04:27,265 --> 01:04:28,663
Blooming hell.

950
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:33,396
Who else knows?
- No one.

951
01:04:34,772 --> 01:04:38,401
Let's keep it that way. I need
to talk to the Commissioner.

952
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:40,334
I'll take that.

953
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:51,152
His name is Junaid. He's been
on special branch's watch-list

954
01:04:51,255 --> 01:04:52,687
for about a year.

955
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,019
Only he and Ali are friends.

956
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:58,420
You see what I see.
Our esteemed Commander

957
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,959
shaking hands with a
known Muslim extremist.

958
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,431
It's hardly a smoking gun.

959
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,430
Depends where you're aiming.

960
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:12,440
For example, if some nosy
reporter were to get hold of him.

961
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:28,847
Can I get you another?

962
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:31,391
I am very particular
about who I drink with.

963
01:05:31,493 --> 01:05:33,791
Oh, flattery will
get you everywhere.

964
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:47,168
Hold the presses.

965
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:55,873
Bismillah (in the name of Allah).

966
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:06,984
Assalum aleikum.

967
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:08,117
Aleikum assalum, Yunus brother.

968
01:06:08,863 --> 01:06:09,887
I want two.

969
01:06:09,997 --> 01:06:11,362
You want two sheep.
- Yeah, that's right.

970
01:06:22,876 --> 01:06:23,900
Hey, mate.

971
01:06:37,891 --> 01:06:38,915
Hello.

972
01:06:39,024 --> 01:06:40,958
Tariq, have you see
the News Daily today?

973
01:06:42,896 --> 01:06:46,058
I wouldn't use that
rag to wrap your meat.

974
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:47,923
I suggest you have a look.

975
01:06:51,004 --> 01:06:52,800
Have you any idea how this happened?

976
01:06:54,574 --> 01:06:57,167
I have my suspicions.

977
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,411
It won't do,
Commander. It won't do at all.

978
01:07:02,915 --> 01:07:04,815
I have known Junaid
since I was a child

979
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:06,145
but we're barely on
speaking terms any more.

980
01:07:06,852 --> 01:07:08,877
Nevertheless, the
Commissioner feels

981
01:07:09,088 --> 01:07:14,048
and I agree, it might be
best if you took some time off.

982
01:07:16,427 --> 01:07:19,954
A holiday. You look
as if you can use it.

983
01:07:21,933 --> 01:07:25,494
And after this blows over.
We'll perhaps look again

984
01:07:25,604 --> 01:07:27,332
at your request for promotion.

985
01:07:35,046 --> 01:07:37,570
Please give my best to Susan.

986
01:09:02,964 --> 01:09:09,164
I'm home. Oh, hi.

987
01:09:09,703 --> 01:09:10,931
I didn't know you...

988
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,369
Oh, class got cancelled.

989
01:09:20,514 --> 01:09:21,538
Are you okay?

990
01:09:21,648 --> 01:09:22,672
I'm fine.

991
01:09:22,983 --> 01:09:25,281
You're sure? You look a bit pale.

992
01:09:32,358 --> 01:09:36,124
After dedicating nearly
my entire adult life

993
01:09:36,562 --> 01:09:37,961
to the service of these men.

994
01:09:40,033 --> 01:09:42,160
After working longer and
fighting harder than

995
01:09:42,269 --> 01:09:43,701
any white officer in the force

996
01:09:44,004 --> 01:09:46,699
having my own people consider me
a traitor, after all this.

997
01:09:48,674 --> 01:09:51,199
These men for whom I
have always had nothing

998
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:54,336
but the highest respect,
they doubt my integrity

999
01:09:54,746 --> 01:09:55,975
question my honour.

1000
01:09:58,116 --> 01:10:03,555
Tariq, so much has
changed over the years.

1001
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:09,349
But certain things,
perhaps, will never change.

1002
01:10:09,694 --> 01:10:11,423
I used to run down the
hill every morning

1003
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:14,260
to catch No.8 into town.

1004
01:10:15,534 --> 01:10:17,525
Same bus everyday.

1005
01:10:18,103 --> 01:10:22,164
The driver, Eddie, nice bloke,
he would wait for me

1006
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,166
if I was late to show up.

1007
01:10:25,776 --> 01:10:29,735
I was his regular. There
was what? Five or six of us.

1008
01:10:30,047 --> 01:10:31,275
We rode together everyday.

1009
01:10:32,716 --> 01:10:36,015
We were not mates, but
we knew each other well.

1010
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:41,288
And not a smile, a few pleasantries.

1011
01:10:46,063 --> 01:10:50,625
You know, Tariq, July
7th was the first day

1012
01:10:51,402 --> 01:10:53,096
that I missed the bus in years.

1013
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:55,299
But I was there the next day.

1014
01:10:56,674 --> 01:10:57,698
Hey. Hey.

1015
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,348
Morning, Eddie. Miss one day
and you forget all about me.

1016
01:11:06,449 --> 01:11:07,473
Sorry.

1017
01:11:09,085 --> 01:11:13,044
And everything...
Everything was different.

1018
01:11:14,491 --> 01:11:18,791
Morning, Kate. No more smile.
Just that look.

1019
01:11:23,633 --> 01:11:27,797
Nothing that happened before
that day, none of it matters now.

1020
01:11:29,172 --> 01:11:30,196
All they see now

1021
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:34,168
all they will see when
they look at us, are terrorists.

1022
01:11:34,611 --> 01:11:37,671
You don't really
believe that, do you?

1023
01:12:11,879 --> 01:12:13,107
Who died?

1024
01:12:14,448 --> 01:12:15,779
What? It's like a funeral in here.

1025
01:12:15,883 --> 01:12:18,248
Please. I've had a very trying day.

1026
01:12:20,221 --> 01:12:22,314
Dad. Dad.

1027
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:23,446
What?

1028
01:12:23,558 --> 01:12:25,253
What time are we going to
the galleria on Saturday?

1029
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,261
I'm sorry. There are...
I don't think I can make it.

1030
01:12:30,697 --> 01:12:32,460
But the book signing.

1031
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,631
You promised.

1032
01:12:34,734 --> 01:12:36,259
We'll do it another time, yeah?

1033
01:12:36,636 --> 01:12:37,660
Tariq.

1034
01:12:48,248 --> 01:12:50,148
Okay, once more with tension.

1035
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,877
Just finish your dinner, young lady.

1036
01:12:52,252 --> 01:12:53,583
It's your turn to do the washing up.

1037
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:00,488
We'll go to the Galleria,
just the two of us.

1038
01:13:01,393 --> 01:13:02,417
How would that be?

1039
01:13:02,728 --> 01:13:03,753
Thanks, Mum.

1040
01:13:15,608 --> 01:13:16,632
What?

1041
01:13:24,315 --> 01:13:25,908
Found this in Zaheer's room.

1042
01:13:30,788 --> 01:13:33,916
So? What are you trying to say?

1043
01:13:36,394 --> 01:13:39,295
Look closer. It's the same shirt.

1044
01:13:39,397 --> 01:13:42,195
Oh, come one, Susan.

1045
01:13:43,334 --> 01:13:45,302
That's a very famous Pakistani band.

1046
01:13:45,402 --> 01:13:46,426
There must be hundreds

1047
01:13:46,537 --> 01:13:48,868
maybe, thousand of
t-shirts with that logo.

1048
01:13:48,972 --> 01:13:50,668
Yes, maybe in Pakistan.

1049
01:13:51,909 --> 01:13:53,206
Susan there...

1050
01:13:53,311 --> 01:13:54,676
I know he's your nephew.

1051
01:13:55,245 --> 01:13:57,874
But I'm your wife.
I need you to listen to me.

1052
01:13:59,983 --> 01:14:01,883
I want you to see what I see.

1053
01:14:04,755 --> 01:14:06,552
See what you see?

1054
01:14:07,257 --> 01:14:08,383
I know what you see.

1055
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:10,951
When you look with
those western eyes

1056
01:14:12,729 --> 01:14:14,594
brown skin is the
first thing you see

1057
01:14:15,932 --> 01:14:18,457
and terrorist is the first
word that pops into your head.

1058
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:23,239
Sometimes, I wonder what
you see when you look at me.

1059
01:14:29,812 --> 01:14:31,906
Well, I used to see my husband.

1060
01:14:33,482 --> 01:14:34,710
I wonder where he's gone.

1061
01:14:36,452 --> 01:14:37,612
Because I miss him.

1062
01:14:47,963 --> 01:14:48,987
Thanks, Mum.

1063
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,273
Officially, they're saying,
he's on holiday.

1064
01:15:01,943 --> 01:15:04,343
We British do love our euphemisms.

1065
01:15:04,746 --> 01:15:06,680
So much more
pleasant than the truth.

1066
01:15:07,315 --> 01:15:08,373
How's he taking it?

1067
01:15:12,053 --> 01:15:14,283
Like someone ran
him down with a bus.

1068
01:15:38,979 --> 01:15:41,504
Things are very tense at the
department right now, Susan.

1069
01:15:41,614 --> 01:15:45,312
Phone lines are lit up
day and night with tips.

1070
01:15:45,418 --> 01:15:46,442
People who think

1071
01:15:46,553 --> 01:15:47,712
their neighbours are
making chemical bombs

1072
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:48,879
in their bathrooms.

1073
01:15:49,422 --> 01:15:50,446
Most of the time, it's nothing.

1074
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:52,751
Just people's
imagination running away.

1075
01:15:53,893 --> 01:15:56,054
So, do you think
it's my imagination.

1076
01:15:57,029 --> 01:16:00,521
The limp in his walk and that
T-shirt stuffed under his bed.

1077
01:16:00,633 --> 01:16:03,932
And the way he covers up the computer
screen and his radical views.

1078
01:16:04,036 --> 01:16:05,799
Yes, but it's hardly
conclusive evidence.

1079
01:16:06,973 --> 01:16:08,406
So, you don't want to help me then?

1080
01:16:09,108 --> 01:16:12,008
Susan, if your husband, my boss

1081
01:16:12,111 --> 01:16:13,806
finds out that I
went behind his back

1082
01:16:13,912 --> 01:16:16,403
and had his nephew
tailed as a terror suspect.

1083
01:16:17,649 --> 01:16:19,880
Well, I can just kiss any
hope of a promotion goodbye.

1084
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,679
Who would tell him?

1085
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:19,857
He's here.

1086
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:24,128
Assalum aleikum.
- Aleikum assalum.

1087
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:35,878
Elijah got everything you requested.

1088
01:18:36,517 --> 01:18:37,541
I hope it's enough.

1089
01:18:39,987 --> 01:18:41,011
It should be fine.

1090
01:18:45,592 --> 01:18:47,150
How long will it take
to complete the job?

1091
01:18:47,929 --> 01:18:51,625
I need to be careful. I only
have access to the lab after hours.

1092
01:18:51,933 --> 01:18:54,901
Someone on the janitorial
staff is sympathetic to our cause.

1093
01:18:55,535 --> 01:18:57,093
It's always good to
have such friends.

1094
01:19:02,608 --> 01:19:06,169
There's been a change in plan.
It will happen this Saturday.

1095
01:19:06,813 --> 01:19:07,836
Saturday?

1096
01:19:07,948 --> 01:19:08,972
Insha'Allah (If Allah wills).

1097
01:19:10,016 --> 01:19:12,711
You must accompany
Elijah to help with the job.

1098
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:16,516
That is not what we agreed on.

1099
01:19:17,623 --> 01:19:20,524
Things have changed.
Aziz has been taken in

1100
01:19:20,626 --> 01:19:23,186
and the authorities are
keeping a closer eye on things.

1101
01:19:24,563 --> 01:19:25,928
Elijah cannot do this alone.

1102
01:19:27,232 --> 01:19:28,722
I need someone I can trust.

1103
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:34,737
I can trust you, can't I? Can't I?

1104
01:19:39,244 --> 01:19:40,540
Yes, Imam.

1105
01:19:45,316 --> 01:19:46,545
Darn.

1106
01:19:47,252 --> 01:19:50,084
God be with you. Allah Hafiz
(may God be your guardian).

1107
01:19:50,655 --> 01:19:51,679
Khuda Hafiz.

1108
01:20:25,155 --> 01:20:26,179
Oh, shucks.

1109
01:20:32,962 --> 01:20:36,660
Brother. Open the gate.
Open the gate.

1110
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:41,927
Thank you.

1111
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:43,063
I only need a few hours.

1112
01:21:35,756 --> 01:21:37,246
You've reached the
voice mail of Ruby Kaur.

1113
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:38,984
I'm not available at the moment.
But leave a message

1114
01:21:39,093 --> 01:21:40,720
and I'll get back to you.

1115
01:22:03,717 --> 01:22:04,740
It's me. Are you in there?

1116
01:22:04,851 --> 01:22:05,875
Oh, hi.

1117
01:22:07,053 --> 01:22:09,215
Oh, why did you close your laptop?
Up to something wicked?

1118
01:22:09,923 --> 01:22:11,287
Just finishing my home work.

1119
01:22:11,858 --> 01:22:13,757
Do you fancy a break?
I'm going to go get some ice cream.

1120
01:22:15,728 --> 01:22:18,697
Come on, you know what they
say about all work and no play.

1121
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,767
I'm sorry, I can't.

1122
01:22:24,737 --> 01:22:25,761
Okay.

1123
01:23:46,416 --> 01:23:50,910
Commander. Commander?

1124
01:23:53,022 --> 01:23:54,046
Thank you.

1125
01:23:54,223 --> 01:23:57,921
You have my condolences.
I know you two were close.

1126
01:24:00,028 --> 01:24:01,859
Any idea what she
was doing out here?

1127
01:24:02,898 --> 01:24:03,922
No.

1128
01:24:04,967 --> 01:24:07,128
Nothing to do with
the Hassan inquiry?

1129
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:13,005
As I am sure, you know, I've
been removed from that inquiry.

1130
01:24:13,976 --> 01:24:18,140
Sir, we found this on her.

1131
01:24:19,915 --> 01:24:20,939
There's not much there.

1132
01:24:21,048 --> 01:24:22,949
Well, maybe the tech
can get something off it.

1133
01:24:23,385 --> 01:24:25,477
See that they do. Top priority.

1134
01:24:26,988 --> 01:24:29,218
Commander, you should go home.

1135
01:24:33,261 --> 01:24:37,823
Commander? Sir? Is there
anything that I can help you...

1136
01:24:37,932 --> 01:24:39,160
No worries. No worries. Commander.

1137
01:24:41,135 --> 01:24:42,159
Oh, sorry.

1138
01:24:44,338 --> 01:24:45,362
Hey! Well, Commander...

1139
01:24:45,473 --> 01:24:46,497
What did you find?

1140
01:24:46,607 --> 01:24:47,834
I was able to
salvage the memory card.

1141
01:24:47,942 --> 01:24:50,240
She made one phone call the
night she died to this number.

1142
01:24:52,947 --> 01:24:53,970
That's my number.

1143
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,048
I might also be able to...
Just a minute.

1144
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:58,448
These are all photos she
had her camera at the time.

1145
01:24:59,353 --> 01:25:00,979
Did she take any, yesterday?

1146
01:25:01,087 --> 01:25:02,111
There is one.

1147
01:25:03,089 --> 01:25:04,113
Here it is.

1148
01:25:24,977 --> 01:25:26,001
Junaid.

1149
01:25:26,111 --> 01:25:27,545
Oh, Tariq. What a surprise!

1150
01:25:28,981 --> 01:25:30,881
I know what you've
been up to, Junaid.

1151
01:25:30,983 --> 01:25:32,541
Junaid, I know what you're doing.

1152
01:25:32,985 --> 01:25:35,886
Yes, I know. I'm
watering the plants.

1153
01:25:35,988 --> 01:25:37,478
I found out you've been
meeting with Zaheer, Junaid.

1154
01:25:37,589 --> 01:25:40,080
I want to know why? I want to
know why he's coming to see you.

1155
01:25:40,993 --> 01:25:45,362
Zaheer? Oh, your nephew.
The peacemaker? How is he?

1156
01:25:45,664 --> 01:25:48,098
I hope he hasn't gotten
himself into any trouble.

1157
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:50,298
What have you been
filling his head with?

1158
01:25:51,203 --> 01:25:54,036
That there will be virgins awaiting
him in paradise if he kills himself.

1159
01:25:54,138 --> 01:25:55,572
There will be songs
written in his name?

1160
01:25:57,075 --> 01:25:59,908
Listen, Junaid. He's a young man.
He's my sister's son.

1161
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:03,378
He's my flesh and blood.
Do not try to influence him.

1162
01:26:04,215 --> 01:26:08,515
My friend, have you nothing in
your life you would kill for?

1163
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,920
The house of Islam will
not be built on violence.

1164
01:26:19,964 --> 01:26:22,330
But if people like you
continue giving it a bad name...

1165
01:26:22,699 --> 01:26:23,996
One day, old friend.

1166
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:27,593
One day, you have to decide,
are you a policeman

1167
01:26:27,704 --> 01:26:29,001
who happens to be a Muslim

1168
01:26:29,106 --> 01:26:31,074
or a Muslim who
happens to be a police officer?

1169
01:26:31,174 --> 01:26:32,198
For me...

1170
01:26:32,309 --> 01:26:36,472
You cannot be both. Now,
if you will excuse me.

1171
01:26:37,047 --> 01:26:38,206
It's time for my prayers.

1172
01:26:39,249 --> 01:26:40,943
You're not going anywhere, mate.

1173
01:26:41,051 --> 01:26:44,077
Really? You have some
evidence against me?

1174
01:26:45,187 --> 01:26:46,621
You can show yourself out.

1175
01:26:56,266 --> 01:26:57,289
Hello.

1176
01:26:58,601 --> 01:27:00,295
Is this D.I. Marber's house?

1177
01:27:00,403 --> 01:27:01,427
Yes, it is.

1178
01:27:02,271 --> 01:27:03,295
I am...

1179
01:27:03,406 --> 01:27:05,306
Oh, I know who you are.
Please come in, sir.

1180
01:27:05,408 --> 01:27:06,432
Thanks.

1181
01:27:11,413 --> 01:27:12,437
Danny.

1182
01:27:13,015 --> 01:27:16,177
Well, this is a surprise.
I see you've met my wife, Hannah.

1183
01:27:16,285 --> 01:27:17,979
Hannah, this is Commander Ali.

1184
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:22,447
Pleased to meet you. Well,
I'll leave the two of you, then.

1185
01:27:24,092 --> 01:27:25,650
So to what do I owe this pleasure?

1186
01:27:26,161 --> 01:27:27,389
Have you come to
give me another lecture?

1187
01:27:27,495 --> 01:27:28,519
I need help.

1188
01:27:28,763 --> 01:27:29,991
Oh, from a racist.

1189
01:27:30,098 --> 01:27:32,123
No. From a realist.

1190
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:48,478
No, that password didn't work.
Can you think of another one?

1191
01:27:52,587 --> 01:27:57,683
Try Jannat (heaven). J-A-N-N-A-T.

1192
01:28:04,131 --> 01:28:05,290
Access Denied.

1193
01:28:11,605 --> 01:28:17,236
Zara. Ismat. I-S-M-A-T.

1194
01:28:20,279 --> 01:28:21,303
We're in.

1195
01:28:38,231 --> 01:28:41,324
Blueprints. I don't
recognise this building.

1196
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,725
I do. Galleria Shopping Centre.

1197
01:28:45,103 --> 01:28:48,129
Oh, no. That's where mum
took Imran for the book signing.

1198
01:28:49,508 --> 01:28:51,066
Oh, blooming hell.

1199
01:28:53,778 --> 01:28:56,338
I need a tactical squad to
the Galleria Shopping Centre.

1200
01:28:56,448 --> 01:29:01,078
We need to activate Operation
Crisis. On my authorization.

1201
01:29:01,786 --> 01:29:04,151
Yes, I take full responsibility,
just do it.

1202
01:29:04,789 --> 01:29:08,224
Oh, no. Susan's
phone is out of range.

1203
01:29:33,616 --> 01:29:35,379
I have programmed the
number in already.

1204
01:29:35,486 --> 01:29:37,386
Just press 'Send' to detonate.

1205
01:29:38,821 --> 01:29:43,190
You better keep it. I'll get it
back from you after I leave the bag.

1206
01:29:45,229 --> 01:29:46,252
Where will you leave it?

1207
01:29:48,364 --> 01:29:50,332
Wherever it will
inflict the most casualties.

1208
01:29:51,234 --> 01:29:55,261
Whoever the explosion
does not kill, the gas will.

1209
01:29:57,507 --> 01:29:58,531
Say it.

1210
01:30:03,846 --> 01:30:04,869
Say it, brother!

1211
01:30:09,851 --> 01:30:11,341
Inshallah (if God wills).
- Inshallah.

1212
01:30:20,262 --> 01:30:21,752
There you go.
- Thanks.

1213
01:30:23,332 --> 01:30:24,356
Hey, what's your name?

1214
01:30:24,465 --> 01:30:25,489
Imran Ali.

1215
01:30:32,808 --> 01:30:34,173
You're going to read this book?

1216
01:30:34,276 --> 01:30:35,300
Of course.

1217
01:30:35,409 --> 01:30:36,433
Yes.

1218
01:30:39,747 --> 01:30:40,771
Here you go, Imran.

1219
01:30:40,881 --> 01:30:42,178
Thank you.
- Cool. Bye.

1220
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:44,578
How are you doing? What's your name?

1221
01:32:17,709 --> 01:32:19,336
Good afternoon, gentleman.

1222
01:32:19,777 --> 01:32:21,403
I'm going to need
access to your cameras.

1223
01:32:41,465 --> 01:32:43,899
Daddy. I knew he'd come.

1224
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,490
Imran, Susan.

1225
01:32:47,471 --> 01:32:50,770
Susan, I need you to take
Imran away from this place at once.

1226
01:32:57,546 --> 01:32:58,570
Is he one of yours?

1227
01:32:58,681 --> 01:32:59,706
No, he's not.

1228
01:32:59,815 --> 01:33:00,839
Where is that?

1229
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:03,317
That's the boiler room.
Back of the second floor entry room.

1230
01:33:06,422 --> 01:33:08,515
Will you keep an eye out?
I'll best follow him.

1231
01:33:15,364 --> 01:33:16,592
You. Stop!

1232
01:33:17,699 --> 01:33:18,724
Move! Move! Move!

1233
01:33:29,444 --> 01:33:34,472
I'm police. You're surrounded.

1234
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:37,611
Come out with your
hands in the air.

1235
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:47,493
Out! Out! Everybody out.

1236
01:34:04,478 --> 01:34:05,638
Blooming hell, are you okay?

1237
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,972
Mike to control, Mike to control,
Officer shot. Lower north hall.

1238
01:34:10,617 --> 01:34:12,380
Call ambulance. Over.

1239
01:34:12,485 --> 01:34:13,578
There's another one.

1240
01:34:19,092 --> 01:34:20,389
You killed my brother.

1241
01:34:21,094 --> 01:34:22,391
Darn you.

1242
01:34:22,495 --> 01:34:24,930
Zaheer! Zaheer! Stop! Stop!
Don't do this.

1243
01:34:25,031 --> 01:34:26,932
Zaheer, don't do this.
I beg of you, Zaheer.

1244
01:34:27,033 --> 01:34:30,060
Mamu! All I have to do is hit send.

1245
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:33,605
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Hold it!
Don't shoot! That's an order.

1246
01:34:34,507 --> 01:34:36,475
Move back. Back away now.

1247
01:34:37,577 --> 01:34:39,010
You do not want to do this, Zaheer.

1248
01:34:39,979 --> 01:34:43,004
Zaheer, you do not want to
do this. Please listen to me.

1249
01:34:43,115 --> 01:34:45,948
I am a warrior of Allah.
It is my duty.

1250
01:34:46,652 --> 01:34:48,415
If you do this Zaheer,
these officers will kill you.

1251
01:34:49,054 --> 01:34:50,488
Must you die, as well?

1252
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:53,081
Imam would say it's a good death.
A righteous death.

1253
01:34:53,191 --> 01:34:54,818
So why doesn't he die himself, then?

1254
01:34:57,996 --> 01:34:59,486
Listen to me, my son.

1255
01:34:59,599 --> 01:35:01,498
A self-inflicted death
is a sin in Islam.

1256
01:35:02,467 --> 01:35:05,027
There is no paradise for those
who spill the blood of innocents.

1257
01:35:05,136 --> 01:35:09,436
Everyday. Everyday, the blood
of innocent Muslims is spilled

1258
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:12,031
by Western governments
and their war on terror.

1259
01:35:12,878 --> 01:35:15,506
And you, you represent them.

1260
01:35:15,614 --> 01:35:16,638
Please Zaheer...

1261
01:35:16,747 --> 01:35:17,771
You are one of them.

1262
01:35:17,883 --> 01:35:18,907
Please. There is still time.

1263
01:35:19,016 --> 01:35:20,040
No.

1264
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:22,050
Allah ho akbar.

1265
01:36:38,693 --> 01:36:44,996
Mom, Mom. I was so
worried about you.

1266
01:36:45,767 --> 01:36:48,200
It's all right,
baby. It's all right.

1267
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:50,060
Where's dad?

1268
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:59,735
And Zaheer? I'm so
happy you're okay.

1269
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:01,941
If anything would
have happened to you.

1270
01:37:03,217 --> 01:37:04,843
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1271
01:37:34,747 --> 01:37:39,707
Assalum aleikum. When
they said I had a visitor.

1272
01:37:40,887 --> 01:37:42,717
I assumed it was my solicitor.

1273
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:53,992
I have to know something, Junaid.
When did this happen to Zaheer?

1274
01:37:56,702 --> 01:37:58,670
When did you burn on this path?

1275
01:37:59,705 --> 01:38:01,866
Allah showed him the
path of enlightenment.

1276
01:38:02,841 --> 01:38:03,865
Junaid, I don't...

1277
01:38:03,975 --> 01:38:08,275
After his father died, you were
not around in Pakistan but I was.

1278
01:38:09,915 --> 01:38:12,883
I'm sorry about Zaheer.
He was a great soldier.

1279
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:19,019
There will always be casualties
because we're in a holy war.

1280
01:38:20,925 --> 01:38:22,290
It's not my war.

1281
01:38:23,728 --> 01:38:24,752
It is, now.

1282
01:38:41,945 --> 01:38:46,178
How are you? Oh, I'm sorry.
That's a stupid question.

1283
01:38:49,753 --> 01:38:51,778
The press are calling you a hero.

1284
01:38:53,423 --> 01:38:56,187
You saved hundreds,
probably thousands of lives.

1285
01:38:58,962 --> 01:39:01,192
I would have gladly
settled for just one more.

1286
01:39:01,297 --> 01:39:02,993
You did a very hard thing, Tariq.

1287
01:39:04,033 --> 01:39:06,730
I cannot possibly imagine
what you must be going through.

1288
01:39:07,437 --> 01:39:09,735
No, you can't.

1289
01:39:10,106 --> 01:39:14,669
Try to take some comfort in the
knowledge that he gave you no choice.

1290
01:39:17,313 --> 01:39:19,144
There is always a choice.

1291
01:39:22,985 --> 01:39:26,216
I know it's early,
but I thought I'll leave these.

1292
01:39:27,923 --> 01:39:30,220
Your promotion has been confirmed.

1293
01:40:56,542 --> 01:41:00,171
Sir, I have a Fiona Monroe on
line one. She said it's urgent.

1294
01:41:02,214 --> 01:41:03,238
Put her through.

1295
01:42:07,944 --> 01:42:10,037
Representatives for the
family of Baqir Hassan

1296
01:42:10,146 --> 01:42:12,171
the young man shot
to death by police

1297
01:42:12,282 --> 01:42:13,977
on a London train platform

1298
01:42:14,082 --> 01:42:15,448
today, confirmed that
the police department

1299
01:42:15,551 --> 01:42:17,450
has agreed to pay an
out-of-court settlement.

1300
01:42:17,552 --> 01:42:19,918
Inside sources confirmed
that the evidence provided by

1301
01:42:20,023 --> 01:42:23,287
former Police Commander Tariq
Ali, influenced their decision.

1302
