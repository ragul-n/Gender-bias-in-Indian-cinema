1
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:59,613
He's the worst stand-up comedian.

2
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,642
I cannot believe how
much time I've wasted.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,378
He's cracking such pathetic
jokes. Who let him in?

4
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,342
Okay, I promise you my next
joke will make you crack up.

5
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,169
I tried writing a letter last night.

6
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,201
“With a broken pencil.

7
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:11,705
But I just couldn't.

8
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,011
You know why?

9
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,034
Anyone?

10
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,134
Anyone?

11
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:17,668
Anyone?

12
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:20,234
You?

13
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:21,634
No?

14
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,470
Because it was pointless.

15
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:27,435
My three own niece cracks better jokes.

16
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:29,340
This guy's jokes are pathetic.

17
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:30,111
Yeah!

18
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,373
Okay. Okay. Okay.

19
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,143
What did one potato say
to another on the phone?

20
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,368
'Aloo' (Potato)!

21
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:38,946
That's rubbish!

22
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,676
What do you call a ghost
in a telephone?

23
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,903
A 'Phone-bhooth' (ghost)!

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,842
Get out!

25
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,471
Shut up! - You suck!

26
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:53,546
And now, one of Amitabh Bachchan's
famous dialogue.

27
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,109
Ashok, I don't get one thing.

28
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,744
Why do you get yourself
humiliated every week?

29
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,439
Why do you have to do this?

30
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:10,634
It's okay.

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,802
I'm still a struggling
Stand-up Comedian.

32
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,139
Struggling?

33
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,977
I wish all the strugglers
in the world were like you.

34
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:32,744
Ashok. - Yes, Kumar.

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,873
We've been best friends
since second Grade.

36
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,477
No one ever laughed on
your jokes back then.

37
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,342
And still no one does.

38
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,142
Take my advice.

39
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,238
Stand-up comedy isn't your cup of tea.

40
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,812
Then is it my saucer?

41
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:57,709
Look at this.

42
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:00,111
Look at this. This is who you are?

43
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,610
You're Ashok Singhania.

44
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,337
Your company's worth
billions of Dollars.

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,740
You're such a wealthy man.

46
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,842
Why do you need to do standup comedy?

47
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,446
Because it's my passion.

48
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,742
<i>An“ Ambam.</i>

49
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,310
lnspite of being such
a big businessman.

50
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,210
He puts on his shorts every year..

51
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,108
...and runs the marathon
like a common man.

52
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,009
Why? Because that's his passion.

53
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,708
Bill Gates. The king of Computers.

54
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:24,243
But he knits, makes sweaters. Why?

55
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:25,671
Because that's his passion.

56
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,143
So chill out, buddy. I am
not quitting my business.

57
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,804
My bad comedy isn't affecting
the Singhania Company shares.

58
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,272
We just had a bad day.

59
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,404
The next show will be
mind-blowing. Come on.

60
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,037
You love me, right?

61
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,534
Yes.

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,601
You trust me?

63
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,505
Yes.

64
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,944
Would I ever take you for a ride?

65
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:48,209
Never.

66
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,234
Good.

67
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,573
Let's go home.

68
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,440
Pilot, take us for a
ride. - Oh, Come on!

69
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:55,376
You can't be doing this.
- Come on, it's good joke.

70
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,435
This is a terrible joke.

71
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,840
Good evening, sir.-
Good evening, Mishti.

72
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:03,469
How was the show, sir? - Show!

73
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,079
The show was fantastic! Much
better than last time.

74
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,644
This time only 15 people walked out.

75
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:10,644
Because there were only 15
people in the audience.

76
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:12,874
Don't listen to him. I am very happy.

77
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,044
In fact, I am so happy..

78
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,010
...I think I'll give you a raise.

79
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,842
Really, sir? - You deserve it, Mishti.

80
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,737
You're not just my estate manager..

81
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,178
"But, you're like a sister to me.

82
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,106
But right now, come
inside the house man!

83
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,376
Baby, I've told you a million times.

84
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,241
I don't understand Bengali! Okay!

85
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,944
Fine, then this Bengali
won't marry you.

86
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,306
I love Howrah Bridge.

87
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,738
I love Bappi Da.

88
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,245
I love Mithun Da. I love
Mishti Doi (Curd).

89
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:45,008
I love you, Mishti.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,001
Sorry!

91
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,034
Come on.

92
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,134
0K8?'-

93
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,603
Sir, I need your signature.

94
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,101
Thanks.

95
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,034
Good evening, sir.

96
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,008
Any change in dad's condition?

97
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:02,434
No, sir.

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,738
Good evening, sir.

99
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,344
What's up, dad?

100
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,901
What's wrong?

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,206
You didn't go out today again.

102
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:21,502
Come on, dad.

103
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,507
This isn't your age to lie down.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,981
You should be playing
golf, going clubbing.

105
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,141
Handling your business empire.

106
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,204
I am not saying that I cannot
handle this business empire.

107
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:33,668
It's just that

108
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,604
you handle it much better.

109
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,806
So get well soon, dad.

110
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:45,137
I miss you.

111
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,039
How about a new joke?

112
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:51,268
Ashok.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,377
He's already in coma.

114
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:01,434
Bye, dad.

115
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,571
Catch you later.

116
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,779
If a girl called Sandra is married
to a 'Saand' (Bull)..

117
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,902
...can we call her Sandra Bullock.

118
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,442
Here we go. Why are 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6 afraid of 7?

119
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,368
anybody-

120
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,701
anybody-

121
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,538
Because 789!

122
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,038
78(ate)9!

123
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,807
Let's get out of here. - Ate 9.

124
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,008
Ate 9.

125
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:41,774
This really is stand-up comedy.

126
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,710
People are standing up and leaving.

127
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,568
0K8?'-

128
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,970
If my shoe pops out
while I am sneezing.

129
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,005
S..can I say I lost 'A-shoe'.

130
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,535
Stop. Stop. Stop.

131
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:35,844
I can't breathe.

132
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:37,575
You're very funny.

133
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,241
And you're very beautiful.

134
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,278
Thank you for laughing.

135
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,472
By the way, I am Ashok.

136
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,676
Ashok Singhania.

137
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,077
The Ashok Singhania!

138
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,006
I always thought Billionaires..

139
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,842
"Don't have a sense of humor.

140
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,068
They don't.

141
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,078
This is my best friend, Kumar.

142
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,506
Hi.- Hi.

143
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,544
I am Shanaya. - Shanaya!

144
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,410
That's a beautiful name. - Thank you.

145
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,344
Do you live in London?
- Yes, of course.

146
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,637
I work for Channel 9.

147
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,475
I'm a reality show host.
'Kaun Banega Millionaire!'

148
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,373
Where we randomly pick a common man..

149
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,808
...from the street and make him
a Millionaire for a week.

150
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:10,275
Oh, wow! - Sounds like
an interesting concept.

151
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,073
It is.

152
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,943
From now on I'll never miss this show.

153
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:14,444
So sweet.

154
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:17,174
So, Ashok, when is your next show?

155
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,335
When are you free?

156
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,110
He'll come and perform.

157
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,302
You guys are so witty.

158
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,012
And you're so Churchgate.

159
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,311
V.TChurchgate.

160
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,503
She gets me, man.

161
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,645
Really nice to meet you.

162
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,505
And you. - Okay. Bye, then.

163
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,876
Wait, Shanaya.

164
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,010
Would you like to have
breakfast with me?

165
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:40,978
I've been invited for lunch
and dinner before.

166
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:43,843
"But for breakfast, never.

167
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,808
Exactly. So?

168
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:48,471
Yeah, sure. Why not?

169
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:50,171
Okay, I'll call you.

170
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,510

take her phone number.

178
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:03,068
Oh my, God!

179
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:04,168
Shanaya.

180
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,178
Shanaya.

181
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,270
Your number...

182
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,037
Matches are really made in heaven.

183
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,837
An ape has got an angel.

184
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,774

Every time I see you I am
over the moon, darling.

I love you, come summer, winter
or monsoon, darling.

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,372
I've never seen anyone
more beautiful than you.

196
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:04,607
Your every posture is magical.

197
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,673
The glow on your face inebriates me.

198
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,647
I have no control over my hear-t
in spite of being rational.

199
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,441
You intoxicate me.

200

You are my insanity, there's
something about your posture.

206
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:43,771
I can't take my eyes off your face.

207
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:47,246
I shall live and die in
your arms hereafter.

208
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,075
All day, all night I'll stay with you.

209
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:53,908
It is my wish to do your bidding.

210
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,309
I will live and die only for you.

211
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:01,472
You are my life and you are my soul.

212
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,872

more beautiful than you.

213

Only you exist in my memories,
my thoughts and my words.

226
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:41,680
You are the one for me, my
heart tells me repeatedly.

227
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,313
The moment I see you
I become impetuous.

228
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:48,880
How does my hear-t endure
so much excitement?

229
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:52,107
I've never seen anyone
more beautiful than you.

230

Caller tune"

254
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,071
Kuwar Amar Nath Singh.

255
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,742
You maybe Ashok Singhania's uncle..

256
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,736
...and the Singhania incorporation's
General Manager.

257
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,171
But you're a big traitor.

258
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:05,375
You want to take over the
Singhania family empire!

259
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,478
But you can't kill Ashok or his father.

260
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,506
Because if either one dies..

261
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,306
...the entire wealth will go to charity.

262
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:19,004
Your dreams of taking
over can come true..

263
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:21,811
...only if Ashok goes in
coma, like his father.

264
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:26,311
...or loses his mental stability.

265
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:28,968
Khan!

266
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,977
I haven't been funding your illegal
scientific experiments.

267
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,309
...all these years so
you can lecture me.

268
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:38,304
Why are you telling me
what I already know?

269
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,110
Because you don't know that.

270
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,846
...I'm going to fulfill your dreams.

271
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,501
With this.

272
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,735
MAD.

273
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,141
MAD.

274
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,044
Mind Altering Drug.

275
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:55,944
Made from samples..

276
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,773
...of different species of dogs.

277
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,505
Whoever takes a dose of
this mixed with water"

278
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,906
...will start thinking that he's a dog!

279
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,644
It fuses with the blood..

280
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,540
...and alters the human genes.

281
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,142
And due to that the chromosome
structure.

282
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,242
...of humans get altered for 24 hours.

283
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,643
Meaning body of a human..

284
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,678
"But mind of a dog.

285
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:21,140
Are you crazy?

286
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:22,745
This is your plan?

287
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,809
I made a big mistake squandering
all that wealth on you.

288
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,639
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

289
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,034
Chinku. Pinku.

290
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,637
Stop holding each other.

291
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,038
You've met my assistants.

292
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,643
Hi, sir.

293
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:57,307
My God, you've put on a little weight.

294
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:01,810
Mr. Kuwar's brought the holy
water of Ganges, for you two.

295
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,173
Holy water of Ganges

296
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:04,871
How religious!

297
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,134
Here, drink.

298
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,434
It works.

299
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,808
It really works.

300
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:27,512
Oh my, God! Khan.

301
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,212
How did you do it? You're a genius.

302
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,173
Now wait and watch.

303
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,803
In tomorrow's board meeting.

304
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:39,969
...I'll turn Ashok Singhania
into a dog..

305
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,610
...In front of all the board members.

306
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,008
Why are you taking me
to your board meeting?

307
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,474
What will I do there?

308
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,103
Oh, come on. Without you,
the board meeting..

309
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:00,544
...will be more like 'bored meeting'.

310
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:01,737
Good morning. - Good morning.

311
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:23,775
There he is.

312
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,834
Hello.

313
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,572
Good morning. - Good morning, sir.

314

Hi.

315

What have you done?

316
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:33,903
What do you mean?

317
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,544
I'm only drinking water, uncle.

318
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,872
That's Ashok's glass.

319
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,069
What difference does it make?

320
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,634
Sit. Sit.

321
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,701
Sit.

322
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,543
Right, let's get on with it. - Sure.

323
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,370
Everybody please sit down.

324
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,503
Before we star-t today's meeting.

325
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,012
...I just want to say thank you.

326
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,573
After dad's unfortunate illness.

327
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:12,170
...none of you ever made me feel..

328
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:15,136
...that I can't handle this
company like dad did.

329
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:16,768
Thank you.

330
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,201
You know..

I know.

332
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,141
Many of you are dad's close friends.

333
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,869
And I respect all of you..

334
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:31,912
...just as much as I respect my dad.

335
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,138
This company is yours
as much as it's mine.

336
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,707
No. I mean it. Thank you.

337
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,073
What a speech!

338
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:48,379
Let's all raise a toast on this note.

339
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,740
Well, alcohol's not allowed
in the office.

340
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,801
But.

341
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,869
...why don't we do it with water?

342
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,638
Come on, Gentlemen, lift your glasses.

343
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,344

You'll all be happy to know..

348
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,541
...that I spoke to Prince
Charles yesterday.

349
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:27,734
And he said to me..

350
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,168
Kumar.

351
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,901
Are you okay?

352
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,668
Are you alright?

L..l am sorry.

So as I was saying, I spoke
to Prince Charles yesterday.

355
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,374
On the phone he told me that.

356
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:50,768
Kumar!

357
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,773
What are you doing? Have you gone mad?

358
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,446
I'm in a board meeting.

359
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:55,634
Behave yourself.

360
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:01,537
So as I was saying, I spoke
to Prince Charles yesterday.

361
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:03,444
And he said to me..

362

Ashok..Kumar!

363
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,676
What are you two doing?

364
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,744
Mr. Singh, what is this nonsense.

365
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,675
What is happening?

366
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,872
I don't know.

367
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:55,173
I don't know.

368
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:56,710
I think we should all go talk to them.

369
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,470
Come on, come let's go talk
to them. Talk to them.

370
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,502
Ashok. Kumar.

371
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:05,734
Ashok.

372
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,174
Ashok. Ashok.

373
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,501
Ashok. Kumar.

374
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:09,941
Listen. Listen.

375
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,204
Open the door somebody. Help.

376
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,509
Help me! It's not opening,
the door's jammed.

377
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:34,634
Stop! Stop!

378
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,207
Sir, I know what's wrong?

379
00:22:36,233 --> 00:22:38,213
Shut up, Srinivasan, you're
just an accountant.

380
00:22:38,267 --> 00:22:39,439
And you also wear a wig.

381
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:42,676
Sir, today's a full moon.
Friday the 13th.

382
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:44,703
Saturn's in its fourth eclipse.

383
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,810
That's why some people
behave like this.

384
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,446
If you don't believe me then Goggle it.

385
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:52,345
Four years ago, back in my village.

386
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,275
...my cousin brother Ramindran..

387
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,405
...turned to a goat on the same day.

388
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:57,707
What nonsense?

389
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:59,610
No, sir. Really.

390
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,240
Lamb. Lamb Shashlik.

391
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:03,405
Then what happened?

392
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:06,346
Nothing, all the villagers were
vegetarians. He survived.

393
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:07,607
Get to the point, Srinivasan.

394
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,939
Sir, I can handle this sir.

395
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,473
I know what to do?

396
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:12,734
Wait.

397
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:14,068
Tommy.

398
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:15,475
Tommy.

399
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:18,113
My cute little doggies.

400
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,505
Tommy sir.

401
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:20,868
Tommy.

402
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,111
Tommy, I'm your Srinivasan Swami.

403
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,946
Come, come. Meet your mommy.

404
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:36,144
Who's your Papa?

405
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:37,646
Who's your mother.

406
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:46,504
Hey rowdy dog, let go.

407
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:49,104
Let go of my leg. He peed on me.

408
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:50,441
Oh my God.

409
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,413
Let go of me.

410
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,639
Help!

411
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:58,810
Where's my hair?

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,479
I am quitting the job.

413
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:04,341
Sir, I cannot do anything.
They are insane, sir.

414
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:06,672
What's going on? Tell
us. What's going on?

415
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,278
We demand an explanation.

416
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,676
I am sorry. - We need to know.

417
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,713
Gentlemen, I hid the
truth from you all.

418
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,375
But the truth is in front of everyone.

419
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:26,874
Ashok and Kumar get such fits.

420
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:27,968
They get fits.

421
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,606
Fits? - Fits?

422
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:30,737
What's he talking about?

423
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,144
Many doctors tried to treat them.

424
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,670
But they have a mental condition.

425
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:37,378
But I promise you, Gentlemen.

426
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,437
I'll take them to the best doctors.

427
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,274
Try my best to treat them.

428
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:43,176
They cannot be treated, sir.

429
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,439
They are insane. They
are completely mad.

430
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:46,944
They should be sent to a mental asylum.

431
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:47,773
Yes.

432
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,643
They should be thrown
in a mental asylum.

433
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,772
They are mad people. - Crazy.

434
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:33,568
Sad.

435
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:35,468
Very sad.

436
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,473
But don't worry.

437
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:39,842
We'll take complete care.

438
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,972
Dr. Shivani is a specialist
in such unique cases.

439
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:44,634
Oh, God!

440
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:46,843
Hold them.

441
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:48,676
Don't worry, we'll handle everything.

442
00:25:48,767 --> 00:25:50,974
Please come, please come. Come.

443
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,775
The end is near!

444
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:56,973
We're all going to die!

445
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,976
I still can't believe this.

446
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,371
A rich man like Ashok Singhania..

447
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,647
...In our mental asylum,
and in this condition.

448
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,604
Doctor, no one should
find out about this?

449
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,237
Yes, of course, Mr. Singh.
You don't worry.

450
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,007
You can rely on our discretion.
- Thank you.

451
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:14,206
Doctor, why's there a fence..

452
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:15,812
...and such high-security here?

453
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:18,575
That's Ward-B of our mental facility.

454
00:26:18,767 --> 00:26:20,007
Mental patient's jail.

455
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:21,368
Jail? - Yes.

456
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,146
You see, Ward-A is a mental hospital.

457
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,041
Ward-B a jail for mental patients.

458
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:27,444
The UK government sent.

459
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,776
...different types of criminally
insane inmates here..

460
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,506
...who have no chance of improving.

461
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:32,768
Oh, I see.

462
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,840
Ajail for the insane. - Exactly.

463
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:36,603
But what do we care?

464
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,346
They don't know what happens in Ward-A.

465
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:41,804
And we don't know what
happens in Ward-B.

466
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,469
But we do know one thing.

467
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,147
Their jailor is just
as crazy as they are.

468
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:48,444
Anyway, I'll take your
leave. Nice meeting you.

469
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,601
Thank you, doctor.

470
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,970
Thank you. - Bye..

471
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,640
You said the effects of your drug
will wear off in 24 hours.

472
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,277
And then those two will be normal.

473
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,176
What do we do then? - Relax.

474
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,444
I've made arrangements for that.

475
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,702
There's a ward-boy inside
on my payroll.

476
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:06,413
Every morning he'll keep
giving them that drug.

477
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,874
Then no one can save them.

478
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:25,712
Good morning Doctors.

479
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:29,939
Please sit down.

480
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:36,978
Doctors, welcome to B-Wing of
Lord Cray G Mental Asylum's..

481
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:40,476
...on this Educational Tour.

482
00:27:40,634 --> 00:27:41,977
I am Dr. Ashok.

483
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,042
And this is my colleague Dr. Kumar.

484
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,704
The mental patients here
are very dangerous.

485
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,907
So we request all of you..

486
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,640
...to give your mobile phones, chains.

487
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:54,940
...and all other valuables to us.

488
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,340
Just for safety.

489
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,435
Only as long as the tour doesn't end.

490
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:02,475
Keep all your belongings here.

491
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,943
We'll keep this in a
safe-deposit locker.

492
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,146
Be seated here. We'll be back.

493
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,977
Day-light robbery.

494
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,949
Boys and girls, you all are
a pan of day-light robbery.

495
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:31,039
I am the warden of this institution.

496
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,643
Y.M. Raj.

497
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,507
But for people like them I
am Yamraj (Lord of Death).

498
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:40,976
They are no doctors.

499
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,570
They are old patients who
are insane themselves.

500
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:45,935
Hi. - Hello.

501
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:48,880
And they are here to rob you.

502
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:50,910
No, no, no We weren't robbing them.

503
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,378
We were just joking. Only joking.

504
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,946
Shut up you mad people.

505
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,670
We aren't mad. - We're
just a little crazy.

506
00:28:57,967 --> 00:29:00,573
Oh, then I'll fix it, right?

507
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:01,968
Here we go.

508
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:06,376
No! No! No! No!

509
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,843
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

510
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:09,869
No! No! No! No!

511
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,369
Oh God!

512
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:14,205
Shock.

513
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,112
Electric.

514
00:29:16,734 --> 00:29:18,236
Electric shock.

515
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,070
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!

516
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,373
Stop it!

517
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:23,778
Electric shock.

518
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:26,877
Oh God! Oh God! Stop it!

519
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,536
Oh God!

520
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,170
Sir, what just happened inside?

521
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:39,605
And who are these two?

522
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,676
You're new here. So you
don't know these two.

523
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,407
They are Ward-B's most
adorable patients.

524
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:47,279
This is Ashok, and that's Kumar.

525
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:49,947
Even if they would have
half a brain each..

526
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,013
"They would still end up
having only half a brain.

527
00:29:52,034 --> 00:29:54,378
But what happened to them
watching electricity?

528
00:29:54,467 --> 00:29:56,071
These two were small-time thieves.

529
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,343
They used to make Paratha
(stuffed bread)..

530
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:01,814
"South Hall Don Karan T
Bijlani's 'Paratha' stall.

531
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,578
Bijlani sir, why did
you get more ﬂour?

532
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,073
We already have more than enough.

533
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:11,240
This isn't ﬂour, its cocaine. Cocaine.

534
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,075
Cocaine in a ﬂour jar?

535
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,913
Don't irritate me. This
is a 'Paratha' stall.

536
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:18,842
If I keep this cocaine
in the ﬂour jar..

537
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,608
...everyone will think it's ﬂour.

538
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:25,607
These days the narcotics department
are on a high-alert.

539
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,972
Keep it carefully.

540
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,809
I've taken full advance from the party.

541
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,472
Don't worry, boss.

542
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:34,041
Your job..will be done.

543
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,435
Why are you winking?

544
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,069
Don't worry, boss.

545
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:41,075
As you sow.. so shall you reap.

546
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:43,909
You winked again. Don't
make it so obvious.

547
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:45,037
Go inside.

548
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,777
Hello and welcome to 'Kaun
Banega Millionaire'.

549
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,404
I am your host and friend Shanaya.

550
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:52,240
One common man that I
choose on this show..

551
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,846
...will get the opportunity to
live the life of a millionaire.

552
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:56,972
For a week. Oh my, God!

553
00:30:57,233 --> 00:31:00,237
That lucky contestant will
get big cars, exotic manors.

554
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:01,905
In short all the luxuries.

555
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:03,776
"Which only a millionaire gets.

556
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:05,107
Are you a millionaire?

557
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:07,070
No way. I am a student.

558
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:08,807
Would you like to be a millionaire?

559
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,172
Of course, who wouldn't?

560
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,640
Perfect. So you're selected
on 'Kaun Banega Millionaire'.

561
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,174
Kumar, you're watching that
rubbish TV show again.

562
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:21,611
Quiet!

563
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:24,610
Don't you dare call this show rubbish.

564
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,247
I'm a big fan of this girl.

565
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:29,547
Just watch. Some day this
girl will choose us..

566
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:32,774
...and make us a millionaire.

567
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:35,746
Stop dreaming. Customers are waiting.

568
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,608
If you don't star-t making
'Parathas' soon..

569
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:42,838
...then we'll certainly
be out on the streets.

570
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,074
Where's the ﬂour?

571
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:49,738
There's no ﬂour.

572
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,841
Where's the ﬂour? Flour! Flour!

573
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,201
Flour!

574
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,481
That day the customers
ate 'Cocaine parathas'.

575
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,803
Potato paratha, Cauliflower
paratha, Radish paratha.

576
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,874
...and with all that they got coke free.

577
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,846
Wow, your 'parathas' are
in a big demand today.

578
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,706
It's not me, it's this
miraculous ﬂour.

579
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:39,212
The ﬂour was over.

580
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,643
So I used the ﬂour kept
below in this jar.

581
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:47,547
What happened? - What have you done?

582
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,203
Why? - That wasn't ﬂour.

583
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,213
Then? - That was Bijlani's cocaine.

584
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:57,046
You made cocaine parathas.

585
00:32:57,634 --> 00:32:59,170
Look. Look.

586
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,479
Bijlani gave them electric shocks.

587
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:20,741
...and it completely ruined the
chemical balance in their brain.

588
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:22,205
Their mental age started reducing..

589
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,109
...and became like children.

590
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:25,746
Oh, God!

591
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,809
Shocks. We're getting shocks.

592
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:31,279
Whenever they see electric
current, they get fits.

593
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:33,904
You can say that, they
had the body of a man..

594
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,343
"But the brain of a kid.

595
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,601
Poor guys.

596
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,376
Good morning.

597
00:33:42,434 --> 00:33:43,936
No, it's good afternoon.

598
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,043
It's lunchtime. 12 o'clock.

599
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,078
Our clocks stopped tikking long back.

600
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:52,041
12 o'clock? - Yes.

601
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,645
Come on. Let's go.

602
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:54,768
Come on.

603
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:18,375
Why do you always take such
a risk at lunchtime?

604
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:22,279
If that warden catches us,
he'll torture us to death.

605
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:26,605
I am ready to endure every
beating, every tenure.

606
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,637
Because she's worth it.

607
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,779
I love her.

608
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:35,607
If you love her then why
don't you tell her?

609
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:36,837
And what do I tell her?

610
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,901
Tell her..

611
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,901
We are caught!

612
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:43,374
That you're a doctor for the insane
and I am the king of the mad men.

613
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:45,276
Let's fall madly in love.

614
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,668
Right? Right?

615
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:48,312
Don't feel shy.

616
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:51,676
I say you jump over the wall
and say it right now.

617
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,470
I insist.

618
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:54,834
Please.

619
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:56,276
Or else you'll see my dead face.

620
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:57,244
Go on. - Come on.

621
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:58,746
Go on. - Thank you.

622
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,808
Come on. - How dare you?

623
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,574
Come down. Come down.

624
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:07,208
If this was my uncle Hitler's Germany..

625
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:09,214
...I would've put you
two in a gas chamber.

626
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:11,336
...and used my personal gas on you two.

627
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,210
Mad fellows.

628
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:15,736
We are not mad.

629
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,474
We're just a little crazy.

630
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,001
Catch them.

631
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:36,814
We are spoilt, madcap barons.

632
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,613
Read us, for we are open books.

633
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:44,640
We are like bread as
well as like butter.

634
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,404
We aren't insane, brother.

635
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:52,340
We've simply lost our minds.

636
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:55,944
We aren't insane, brother.

637
00:35:56,433 --> 00:36:00,074
We've simply lost our minds.

638
00:36:00,267 --> 00:36:03,680
Seeing us gives rise
to only this question.

639
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,479
Does the fish have a black
spot or is the fish black?

640
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:11,471
This is a mint that makes fake coins.

641
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,247
We aren't insane, brother.

642
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:19,342
We've simply lost our minds.

643
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,004
We aren't insane, brother.

644
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:27,306
We've simply lost our minds.

645
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,775
We became notorious,
we became eminent too.

646
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:50,609
From our dear ones we are alienated,
alienated, alienated.

647
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:54,271
Our hearts were murdered,
and tortured too.

648
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:58,174
Grief has crushed us,
crushed us, crushed us.

649
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,843
Oh, my partner. Oh my partner.

650
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:10,049
Oh my partner, a rose has bloomed
in my barren garden on seeing you.

651
00:37:11,334 --> 00:37:14,907
We aren't insane, brother.

652
00:37:15,134 --> 00:37:18,809
We've simply lost our minds.

653
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,675
We aren't insane, brother.

654
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:26,681
We've simply lost our minds.

655
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:49,234
Excuse me.

656
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,969
Why are you showing us this bone?

657
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:52,713
And why have we been kept
in this mental asylum?

658
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,970
And in strait jackets.

659
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,270
Do we look insane?

660
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,504
Sir.. - Do you know who I am?

661
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,702
I am Ashok Singhania.

662
00:37:57,833 --> 00:38:00,211
If these strait jackets aren't
taken off immediately.

663
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:03,109
...I'll sue you and your mental institution
for Millions of Pounds.

664
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,803
Yes.

665
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:05,472
Please calm down. - No, you calm down.

666
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,501
Untie us immediately.

667
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,576
Fine. Ward-boy, take them away.

668
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,806
What ward-boy. - Take them away.

669
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:10,471
Okay, one second. One second.

670
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,874
We're calm, okay. See.

671
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:14,473
Alright. - Please release them.

672
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,940
Fast. - Thank you.

673
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:20,310
Let's talk like civilized people.

674
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,471
I'll just ask you some questions.

675
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:26,068
Can we star-t'?

676
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:27,768
Yes.

677
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,743
What's the last thing you two remember?

678
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,612
Yesterday we were in a
board meeting. - Yes.

679
00:38:31,867 --> 00:38:33,369
I was presenting something.

680
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,501
And then"

681
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:39,870
After that we opened our eyes and..

682
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,004
We were here. In the mental asylum.

683
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,672
In strait jackets.

684
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:45,035
Amazing.

685
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,274
Temporary memory loss.

686
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,243
Patients don't remember when
they turned into dogs.

687
00:38:54,634 --> 00:38:55,635
I just.

688
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,838
I am sorry, what did you say?

689
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:58,774
When you turned into dogs?

690
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:01,369
Dogs? - Dogs.

691
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:02,535
Dogs!

692
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:03,702
What rubbish are you talking?

693
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:06,338
I am serious. Yesterday, you
two were behaving like dogs.

694
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:07,903
Oh God. - She called us dogs again.

695
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:10,504
If we're dogs then..you're a cat.

696
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:12,676
You're a lizard. - You're
a 'Chamgadad'.

697
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,778
What's a 'Chamgadad? - It's a bat

698
00:39:15,834 --> 00:39:17,472
Batman.

699
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:18,170
Yeah!

700
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,147
You're a 'Gamchadad.
- That's 'Chamgadad'.

701
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,509
Yes, whatever. You're that
too. You're the entire zoo.

702
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:25,012
Ward-boy, take them both
away. - Okay, no.

703
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:26,603
Listen, listen. Sorry.

704
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,607
We're calm. We're okay.

705
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,606
Ma'am, I think they need some water.

706
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:33,541
Yeah, please give them.

707
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:36,503
Drink some water.

708
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:45,568
Look, doctor.

709
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,379
We're telling you for the last time.

710
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,601
Politely.

711
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:51,808
We're not dogs.

712
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,268
Stop them.

713
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,971
Close the gates. Stop them.

714
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:43,071
Let me go.

715
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,481
Inspector, this is public harassment.

716
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:08,679
Your dog sniffed my entire car.

717
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,406
He even peed on my backseat.
But he didn't find any drugs.

718
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,904
Now can I go please?

719
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:14,271
Alright, you can go.

720
00:41:14,334 --> 00:41:15,335
Thank you. Thank you.

721
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:25,143
Ashok, Kumar, why are you two..

722
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,545
...barking and sniffing like a dog?

723
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:30,341
Why are you barking on me?
I am Karan T Bijlani.

724
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:33,747
What are you looking for inside?

725
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:36,212
What are you sniffing for?

726
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:39,668
Drugs!

727
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,242
Officer, these drugs aren't
mine. - Well done.

728
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,904
This isn't my car either.

729
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:46,771
I came in a taxi.

730
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,176
Let's go.

731
00:41:50,033 --> 00:41:53,674
Ashok and Kumar, I won't spare you two?

732
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,371
Oh my, God!

733
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,871
How could we make such
a big mistake, Shivani?

734
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,147
Sir, Ashok and Kumar were
telling the truth.

735
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:22,970
They've been conspired against.

736
00:42:23,234 --> 00:42:24,804
Someone wants to make them insane.

737
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:26,742
That's why our ward-boy
was drugging them.

738
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:28,537
And what did the ward-boy say..

739
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:30,078
...when you confronted him?

740
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:31,941
Sir, he isn't saying a thing.

741
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:34,108
We should call the police. - Police?

742
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,135
No, no, no, Shivani.

743
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:37,040
Look, we can deal with
the ward-boy later.

744
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:38,670
But if we go to the police.

745
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:41,247
"Then Ashok Singhania will sue us.
He'll shut down this hospital.

746
00:42:41,534 --> 00:42:42,842
Yeah! - Let's do one thing.

747
00:42:43,134 --> 00:42:45,444
Tell Ashok and Kumar that
they're being released.

748
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:47,575
...because they are cured.

749
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:48,645
They are cured.

750
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,146
And don't listen to them at all.

751
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:52,078
Just get them out of here anyway.

752
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,906
In fact, release them right
now. - Not now, sir.

753
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,171
They are still dogs. They will bite me.

754
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,605
In the morning when they turn back
into humans I will let them go.

755
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,701
0K8?'-

756
00:43:04,434 --> 00:43:05,538
It's emPTV-

757
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:07,072
Where's my doctor?

758
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,070
Doesn't she come during lunchtime?

759
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,704
Today is Valentine's Day.

760
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:12,573
I've brought a gift for her.

761
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,940
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

762
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,037
Nobody can keep her away from me, okay.

763
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,669
I'm going over to Ward-A.

764
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,544
I'll see her face to face
and give her this gift.

765
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:22,671
You come along too.

766
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,038
It will only take a minute.

767
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,580
We'll just go there, give
her the gift and come back.

768
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:27,838
Okay?

769
00:43:28,934 --> 00:43:29,969
Only two minutes.

770
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,604
Two minutes. Come on!

771
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,501
Come on.

772
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:43,979
Ashok, just calm down.
- What calm down?

773
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,102
Thank God you're discharging us today.

774
00:43:46,234 --> 00:43:48,805
Otherwise my lawyers would've shutdown
this institution forever.

775
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,711
Forget it, we're going out anyway.

776
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,504
Come, sir. Please come, sir.

777
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:57,280
Wait here for a while, I'll
get your discharge papers.

778
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,539
What papers?

779
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:00,609
Listen, you release us immediately.

780
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:02,042
Sir. - Enough is enough.

781
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:03,812
Sir, paperwork is important.

782
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,446
It will only take a while.

783
00:44:05,534 --> 00:44:06,638
Ward-boy. - Yes, ma'am.

784
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,613
Please get Mr. Ashok and
Mr. Kumar's clothes.

785
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:10,739
Sir, please wait for a while
I'll be right back.

786
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,474
Please hurry up. - Yes,
sir. Sorry, sir.

787
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,401
Sit.

788
00:44:14,534 --> 00:44:15,535
Sit.

789
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:19,579
No, no.

790
00:44:24,434 --> 00:44:25,572
Sir. Sir. Sir.

791
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:27,575
What?

792
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:31,047
Ashok and Kumar jumped into Ward A.

793
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,272
Oh God, why are You so kind to me?

794
00:44:34,434 --> 00:44:35,538
Thanks. Come on.

795
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:38,671
She's taking so long for the paperwork.

796
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:40,780
Relax, she will be here. - What relax?

797
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:42,574
I want to go home. - Fine.

798
00:44:43,034 --> 00:44:44,035
Let's have coffee.

799
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:45,135
I don't want coffee.

800
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:46,441
Come on. - I don't want coffee.

801
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:48,140
She will be back by then,
let's have coffee.

802
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,079
She will be back by then.

803
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:52,268
0K8?'-

804
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,504
Two lattes please. - Sure.

805
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:08,844
Here are your clothes.

806
00:45:08,867 --> 00:45:09,868
Clothes.

807
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:11,037
We aren't naked.

808
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,545
We're wearing clothes.

809
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,441
Dr. Shivani asked me
to give it to you two.

810
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:17,011
Dr. Shivani. Then we'll
definitely wear them.

811
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,709
Go and change in the toilet.

812
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:27,744
Let's go out and drink. - Good idea.

813
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:33,571
Don't get furious.

814
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:35,246
Look, we'll soon be released.

815
00:45:35,334 --> 00:45:37,541
Let's just enjoy this weather
and this lovely coffee

816
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:38,735
0K8?'-

817
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:53,176
Today's Weather.

818
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,773
Today's Weather.

819
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,843
Lovely day for a coffee, right.

820
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,771
Actually, this isn't
coffee, it's latte.

821
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,507
Ah, Latte.

822
00:46:03,634 --> 00:46:04,635
Latein (kicks).

823
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,074
But you don't drink "Latein",
you endure it.

824
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:12,079
Crossed over to ward A,

825
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:13,545
Look, we aren't mad.

826
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,240
Yes, yes, you aren't mad.
You're just a little crazy.

827
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:17,745
Grab them. Come on.

828
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:20,144
Let go. Let me go.

829
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:21,268
Let us go.

830
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,646
Happy Valentine's Day.

831
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:46,935
Thank you!

832
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:52,604
You look more beautiful up close.

833
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:56,704
She looks like Angelina
Jolie from this close.

834
00:46:57,034 --> 00:47:00,504
I guess they aren't
completely sane yet.

835
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,706
Shall we go?

836
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,708

Please come, please.

840
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:13,569
Open the gate please.

841
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,638
Why did you bring us to the gate?

842
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,542
Because. the roads on the
other side of the main gate.

843
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,775
And today is Valentine's Day.

844
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,311
So on this occasion you
two are being released.

845

Here are your release papers.

846
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,611
Thank you. - Good bye.

847
00:47:29,567 --> 00:47:30,568
What happened, Mr. Ashok?

848
00:47:30,867 --> 00:47:31,868
I hate goodbyes.

849
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,401
Goodbye hug!

Don't go! Don't go! Don't go!

00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:45,968
Goodbye. - Doctor.

854
00:47:46,334 --> 00:47:47,813
What now? - Goodbye kiss.

855
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,901
Goodbye. Goodbye.

856
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:51,405
Come on, at least we don't have to..

857
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,078
...see that oaf Yamraj's face again.

858
00:47:54,267 --> 00:47:56,543
If there's hell anywhere on eanh.

859
00:47:56,967 --> 00:47:58,105
Then it's right here.

860
00:47:58,234 --> 00:48:00,009
Its right here. Right here.

861
00:48:01,734 --> 00:48:04,214
The way I am going to
torture you two today.

862
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:09,674
...will be so terrible, that my Master..

863
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:15,315
...Jambo ldi Amin, Saddam,
Achtung Hitler.

864
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,380
Gadaffi and chicken hakka
noodle Kim Jong..

865
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:25,405
...would give me a gold
medal for tenure.

866
00:48:32,934 --> 00:48:35,710
Now I am going to show you.

867
00:48:36,934 --> 00:48:39,608
Sajid Khan's 'Himmatm/ala'.

868
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,706
Ashok. Kumar.

869
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:06,268
Ashok.

870
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:12,473
Kumar. So good to see you guys.

871
00:49:12,734 --> 00:49:14,771
I was on my way to the mental
asylum to see you.

872
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,646
But what are you to doing here.

873
00:49:18,067 --> 00:49:21,742
Today is Valentine's Day,
so I've been discharged.

874
00:49:23,267 --> 00:49:24,803
Of course, they had to.

875
00:49:25,134 --> 00:49:26,238
You two aren't mad.

876
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,008
We've been trying to
say that for so long.

877
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:30,475
We're just a little crazy.

878
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,445
Ashok, why are you talking like this?

879
00:49:34,734 --> 00:49:36,873
And Kumar, why are you staring at me?

880
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,140
Oh my God.

881
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,581
Aren't you Shanaya, from
the reality show?

882
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,544
She's Shanaya. - Your Shanaya.

883
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:48,571
Madam. Madam. He's a big fan.

884
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,906
I guess they aren't
completely sane yet.

885
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,201
Poor things.

886
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,808
Look, I feel you two need some rest.

887
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:58,305
Shall we go? - Where?

888
00:49:58,434 --> 00:49:59,435
Home.

889
00:49:59,734 --> 00:50:00,735
I get it.

890
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:03,337
Now you'll take us to
a big house, won't you?

891
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,777
No, it's a mansion.

892
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:06,510
Your mansion. Shall we go?

893
00:50:06,734 --> 00:50:07,735
Driver.

894
00:50:07,834 --> 00:50:09,279
Mansion.

895
00:50:13,534 --> 00:50:16,174
Why are we dancing? - You fool.

896
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,438
We're on a reality show.
'Kaun Banega Millionare...

897
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,137
And this Shanaya picks any common man..

898
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,745
...and makes them rich.

899
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:26,074
And this time you've been chosen.

900
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,704
You also got a mansion.

901
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,471
Shall we go? - Yes, let's go.

902
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,806
Come on.. come on..

903
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:34,407
Mansion!

904
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:38,746
Albert, Shayana messaged that Ashok
and Kumar are coming home.

905
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:39,903
And you're drinking.

906
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,180
I've told you a thousand times
not to drink during work hours.

907
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,508
Haven't I? - Yes.

908
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,146
If I catch you drinking during
duty hours I will fire you.

909
00:50:46,267 --> 00:50:47,473
It won't happen again.

910
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:49,505
Crazy fellow.

911
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,602
I'll take the label off the bottle.

912
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:58,374
No one will know whether
it's vodka or water.

913
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,607
And then I kicked him.

914
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,145
And he fell down..

915
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,740
Welcome home.

916
00:51:21,234 --> 00:51:22,508
What a house.

917
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:24,578
Dumbo, this is not a real house.

918
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,544
It's a set.

919
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,273
Take a peek at the back, I'm sure
it's hoisted with bamboos.

920
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,401
Come on.

921
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:31,540
But what kind of a reality
show is this?

922
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:33,341
I don't see any cameras.

923
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:35,605
Do you see cameras in Big Boss?

924
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:36,743
No, right.

925
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:38,940
This is in the same format.
Hidden cameras.

926
00:51:40,933 --> 00:51:42,139
And these servants.

927
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,741
They've been hired, per-day artist.

928
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:47,936
And who's the one that's
walking towards us.

929
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:49,711
Her? That's the supporting actor.

930
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:52,073
Now just act like a millionaire, okay.

931
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:52,942
Okay, Okay-

932
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:54,913
Welcome, sir. It's so
good to have you back.

933
00:51:55,367 --> 00:51:57,540
Hello young lady.

934
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:00,944
Wow, that's Pran sir. Let's
see you mimic Rajendra Nath.

935
00:52:04,434 --> 00:52:05,378
What a house.

936
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,276
What a blouse.

937
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:07,573
Do you have a spouse?

938
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:10,940
Hey. Wow!

939
00:52:11,667 --> 00:52:13,237
Where are you going?

940
00:52:13,934 --> 00:52:16,210
Sweety, did you miss me?

941
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:18,305
I missed you so much.

942
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:21,514
Pardon me, aunty, but
I don't know Punjabi.

943
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,409
Means I understand no Punjabi.

944
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,435
Aunty!

945
00:52:26,634 --> 00:52:27,635
Ashok.

946
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:29,475
Ashok, wait.

947
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:31,568
Sandwiches.

948
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:35,743
Sir. Sir.

949
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:37,542
Won't you meet your father?

950
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:39,168
Father?

951
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:42,042
His father passed away
years ago. - Oh my, God!

952
00:52:42,434 --> 00:52:43,435
Don't say that.

953
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,202
He isn't dead..he's in coma.

954
00:52:45,734 --> 00:52:47,111
Coma. - Coma?

955
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,239
Please excuse me.

956
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,607
There's a 'father in coma'
angle in play here.

957
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:00,705
Wow! Why?

958
00:53:01,167 --> 00:53:02,441
For TRP!

959
00:53:02,567 --> 00:53:04,672
Women cry a lot seeing these things.

960
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:06,735
I get it.

961
00:53:06,967 --> 00:53:08,139
So what do I do?

962
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:10,911
Dumbo, if there's a father in coma..

963
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,673
"Then act like they do on daily soaps.

964
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:14,175
You know.

965
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,874
The highest TRP comes from Gujarat.

966
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,545
I get it. I get it.

967
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,506
Wow. Where's papa?

968
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,775
Papa!

969
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,102
Papa!

970
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,440
He's been in coma for six years.

971
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,180
He's in coma for six years.

972
00:53:38,234 --> 00:53:42,649
I've wept buckets of
tears in your memory.

973
00:53:43,134 --> 00:53:46,081
He's crying like a buffoon
in his memory.

974
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,745
Wake up, papa. Wake up.

975
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,738
Go jogging, papa. Go jogging. - What?

976
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,073
A son is talking to his father.

977
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,679
Will you please step outside?

978
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,636
I beg you. - Okay, okay, come on.

979
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,304
Please go out.

980
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:06,505
Hey aunty..you too.

981
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,437
Leave quickly.

982
00:54:10,967 --> 00:54:12,241
Papa.

983
00:54:13,434 --> 00:54:15,744
You're over acting too much. Get up.

984
00:54:16,767 --> 00:54:17,768
Uncle, get up.

985
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:18,968
Get up.

986
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:20,607
Uncle. - Uncle.

987
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,174
Uncle. - Uncle.

988
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:25,134
Uncle.

989
00:54:25,234 --> 00:54:27,214
What method acting, uncle?

990
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,643
What's method acting?

991
00:54:28,734 --> 00:54:30,543
Once you get in the skin
of the character.

992
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,474
"Then you get out only after
the end of the episode.

993
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,543
Then will he lie down like that.

994
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:35,739
"Throughout the entire episode? - Yes.

995
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,302
That's what he's paid for.

996
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:40,940
Wow! Video games.

997
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:42,840
Wow.

998
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:47,944
Why isn't it working?

999
00:54:48,267 --> 00:54:49,337
It's broken.

1000
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:52,211
It's not broken, there's
a fault with the wiring.

1001
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:53,641
Really? - Look.

1002
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:03,746
Dumbo, this wire doesn't
go here, it goes there.

1003
00:55:04,433 --> 00:55:05,912
It won't fit here.

1004
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,976
It goes here, not there.

1005
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,604
It doesn't go here.

1006
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:31,110
It does.

1007
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:35,435
Doesn't.

1008
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,240
It does, put it.

1009
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:43,337
The game's working.

1010
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:13,737
I won! I won! I won!

1011
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:19,777
Yes, Mishti.

1012
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,838
Ashok and Kumar have been discharged
from the mental asylum.

1013
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,001
And they are at home.

1014
00:56:24,067 --> 00:56:25,068
What?

1015
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:27,907
I mean..good. That's great news.

1016
00:56:28,334 --> 00:56:33,113
You look after them. I'll return
tomorrow from Mauritius.

1017
00:56:33,134 --> 00:56:34,704
I'll see you guys then. - Okay, sir.

1018
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,274
Hello.

1019
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,338
You said you can keep them in the
hospital for as long as you want.

1020
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:43,577
Yes, I did. So?

1021
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,237
So how were they released
from the asylum?

1022
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,040
What?

1023
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:49,412
All rubbish talks.

1024
00:56:49,433 --> 00:56:50,810
Hold on, listen to me.

1025
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,044
I'll go the asylum right now and
find out how they were released.

1026
00:56:54,234 --> 00:56:56,475
Get them back in the asylum today!

1027
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:00,803
How did they come out?

1028
00:57:03,434 --> 00:57:05,471
You've been at it for
two hours. Hurry up.

1029
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:06,805
Is your information correct?

1030
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:09,711
Yes. I found out that there's a way
out through the bathroom ceiling.

1031
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:11,242
Hurry HP!

1032
00:57:11,867 --> 00:57:13,369
You already drank fifty
glasses of water.

1033
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:14,469
How much more do you need?

1034
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:16,106
Let me concentrate.

1035
00:57:18,767 --> 00:57:19,768
Yes.

1036
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,677
Come on.

1037
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:26,168
Go.

1038
00:57:28,634 --> 00:57:29,635
Go.. go..

1039
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,601
Come on.

1040
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,901
What are you doing?

1041
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:48,640
I've got to pee.

1042
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,779
If the warden catches us he'll kill us.

1043
00:57:52,834 --> 00:57:55,178
Hurry up. - I know, but..I'm coming.

1044
00:57:58,567 --> 00:58:00,274
I can't believe you, hurry up.

1045
00:58:00,334 --> 00:58:01,574
I had fifty glasses of water.

1046
00:58:01,867 --> 00:58:03,073
We'll be caught.

1047
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:04,234
I am coming.

1048
00:58:05,367 --> 00:58:06,744
Chit-chat in the bathroom.

1049
00:58:07,134 --> 00:58:08,306
Caught you!

1050
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,280
I haven't finished yet.

1051
00:58:38,367 --> 00:58:39,778
I can't control it.

1052
00:58:39,867 --> 00:58:41,471
No, no.

1053
00:59:08,933 --> 00:59:09,934
No.

1054
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,607
Control. Control.

1055
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,172
Done. Done.

1056
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,376
Yuck!

1057
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,572
What's wrong, baby!

1058
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,408
We gave an off to all the servants.

1059
00:59:49,634 --> 00:59:52,740
...and prepared this special
Valentines dinner for you.

1060
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,337
And we thought chicken ala-Keev
is your favorite.

1061
00:59:56,067 --> 00:59:57,808
Our favorite is potato 'Parathai

1062
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,602
Potato 'Paratha?

1063
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,676
But we don't know how to make it.

1064
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,675
So what? We'll make it.

1065
01:00:05,367 --> 01:00:07,108
When did you two star-t making
potato 'Parathas'?

1066
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:10,637
Madam, there are just two things
famous in this world.

1067
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:18,168
WOW!

1068
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:29,503
Only mo!

1069
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:32,069
Bruce Lee's karate.

1070
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:40,608
And Ashok-Kumafis Parathe.

1071
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,175
Where's your kitchen?

1072
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,701
Where is it?

1073
01:00:51,034 --> 01:00:52,445
First take ﬂour.

1074
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,808
Flour! Flour!

1075
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,904
Next add lots of water.

1076
01:00:56,067 --> 01:00:57,569
Water. Water. Water. Water.

1077
01:00:58,567 --> 01:00:59,568
Water.

1078
01:01:00,134 --> 01:01:01,135
Water.

1079
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,645
Vodka in pancake

1080
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,235
That was great.

1081
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,472
Buddy, sometimes you make
the most amazing parathas.

1082
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:24,082
I never had such parathas
in my life before.

1083
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:38,072
I can see two Ashoks.

1084
01:01:42,234 --> 01:01:45,408
Even I can see two Kumars.

1085
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,501
Come here.

1086
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:48,168
Come here.

1087
01:01:52,467 --> 01:01:55,243
Valentine's dinner is over.

1088
01:01:55,367 --> 01:01:58,280
Now let's do what's
done on Valentine's.

1089
01:01:58,434 --> 01:01:59,174
No, no.

1090
01:01:59,267 --> 01:01:59,972
Why?

1091
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,344
We need to go for a morning
walk after dinner.

1092
01:02:02,434 --> 01:02:03,879
No, no. - Kumar.

1093
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:05,135
Kumar.

1094
01:02:05,434 --> 01:02:06,913
Don't go.

1095
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,001
Come on.

1096
01:02:08,634 --> 01:02:09,635
Stick one there.

1097
01:02:10,033 --> 01:02:11,603
Come on, stick it up there.

1098
01:02:11,867 --> 01:02:12,868
There as well.

1099
01:02:12,934 --> 01:02:14,811
Put one on the sky and
on the ground too.

1100
01:02:14,933 --> 01:02:16,844
Let's see how they escape.

1101
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,872
Car..in my area?

1102
01:02:23,467 --> 01:02:24,468
Excuse me.

1103
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,780
Why are Ashok and Kumar's posters
being put up everywhere?

1104
01:02:26,867 --> 01:02:29,643
Because these two dogs
fled from this asylum.

1105
01:02:29,734 --> 01:02:30,735
Fled?

1106
01:02:32,867 --> 01:02:33,868
You mean they haven't been discharged.

1107
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,709
I would never release them.

1108
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:36,908
But who are you?

1109
01:02:36,933 --> 01:02:39,709
They were admitted in this
asylum after my diagnosis.

1110
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:41,134
I am Dr. Khan.

1111
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,301
Doctor?

1112
01:02:42,534 --> 01:02:45,708
You look more like a
protein shake model.

1113
01:02:48,067 --> 01:02:49,478
I know where these two are hiding?

1114
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,501
Really?

1115
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,573
If you tell me where they are hiding..

1116
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,638
...I'll make your nights colorful.

1117
01:02:55,667 --> 01:02:56,372
What do you mean?

1118
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,540
I mean..I'll gift you colorful lamps.

1119
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,974
Okay?

1120
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,973
Don't get ideas, mister.

1121
01:03:03,434 --> 01:03:05,675
I know young men like you.

1122
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:07,609
Then listen. - Yes.

1123
01:03:07,633 --> 01:03:08,805
But from a distance.

1124
01:03:09,334 --> 01:03:11,439
Then speak louder..but in my ears.

1125
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,872
George.

1126
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:22,407
Albert

1127
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:24,638
Stella.

1128
01:03:25,267 --> 01:03:26,746
Where's everyone?

1129
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:27,901
Forget it.

1130
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,372
Parathe.

1131
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,011
I guess your staff was having a
paratha party in your absence.

1132
01:03:34,934 --> 01:03:36,572
I am hungry.

1133
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,838
I am eating these parathas.

1134
01:03:37,933 --> 01:03:39,344
Me too.

1135
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:47,409
Sweaty-pie, don't stay so far from me.

1136
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:48,837
Wait. Wait.

1137
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,307
We'll go change.

1138
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,411
Night-suit. Night-suit. Night-suit.

1139
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,106
Change later.

1140
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,277
What kind of a staff do you have..

1141
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:13,871
...and what type of parathas
did they make?

1142
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,570
It's making my head spin.

1143
01:04:17,034 --> 01:04:18,069
They're my staff.

1144
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:20,569
They're excused.

1145
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:24,207
Must be some spice which they added.

1146
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,877
My head's spinning too.

1147
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,308
Let's go sleep.

1148
01:04:34,734 --> 01:04:36,145
Let's go change first.

1149
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,402
Come with me. Follow me.

1150
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,038
Why are you taking so long?

1151
01:06:14,634 --> 01:06:17,911
Earlier we could see two of them.

1152
01:06:18,034 --> 01:06:21,140
Now I can see four.

1153
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:24,645
And in different color night suits.

1154
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,704
Shanaya.

1155
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:28,168
Mishti.

1156
01:06:30,134 --> 01:06:32,910
Oh, baby. - Come here, baby.

1157
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,377
Your attitude is intoxicating to me.

1158
01:06:55,834 --> 01:06:59,475
Your hear-t is my address.

1159
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:04,074
I am feeling naughty,
listen to my heart.

1160
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:08,510
I'm so crazy for you, baby.
Don't you break my heart.

1161
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:12,640
Lest our night together gets destroyed.

1162
01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:40,473
You have checked into my heart.

1163
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,537
Everything is set between us now.

1164
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,705
This is the breaking news on TV.

1165
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:48,375
This is the breaking news on TV.

1166
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:52,310
I am lost and you are lost.

1167
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:56,677
Your hear-t is my address.

1168
01:07:57,133 --> 01:08:01,309
All my dreams are full of you.

1169
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:05,509
I'm so crazy for you, baby.
Don't you break my heart.

1170
01:08:05,634 --> 01:08:09,639
Lest our night together gets destroyed.

1171
01:08:35,434 --> 01:08:37,505
Baby, you are in my dreams.

1172
01:08:37,567 --> 01:08:39,604
Baby, you know how I'm so hung on you.

1173
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:41,738
Baby, now you tell me what to do.

1174
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,441
Baby, now you tell me..
Tell me what to do.

1175
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:49,544
You tell me what you want.

1176
01:08:49,967 --> 01:08:53,881
Your hear-t is my address.

1177
01:08:54,267 --> 01:08:58,443
I want you to say this
like you mean it, baby.

1178
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:02,540
I'm so crazy for you, baby.
Don't you break my heart.

1179
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:06,638
Lest our night together gets destroyed.

1180
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,643
Yes, Ayesha.

1181
01:09:34,034 --> 01:09:35,240
What?

1182
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,242
The channel head's coming
here to meet me.

1183
01:09:38,634 --> 01:09:39,977
Oh my, God!

1184
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,843
I think I am going to get
an extension of my show.

1185
01:09:42,034 --> 01:09:44,275
Thanks for letting me know.
Okay, I'll go get ready. Bye.

1186
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,547
The reality show's channel
head's coming here.

1187
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:52,378
The owner of this channel.

1188
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,176
"Which hosts our reality
show is coming here.

1189
01:09:55,301 --> 01:09:56,473
So? - So?

1190
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,238
We'll please him and he'll
make us win this show.

1191
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,673
But how will we please him?

1192
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:05,768
Idea!

1193
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,274
My granmother used to say..

1194
01:10:07,467 --> 01:10:10,107
...If you want to please someone
then butter him up.

1195
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,572
Look.

1196
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,238
I guess that's him.

1197
01:10:15,567 --> 01:10:16,568
Sir.

1198
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:18,835
Sir.

1199
01:10:19,734 --> 01:10:21,077
These two are still here?

1200
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:24,576
Stupid Khan couldn't do a simple job.

1201
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:27,380
Ashok. Kumar.

1202
01:10:27,967 --> 01:10:29,241
Sir. Come, sir. - You two..

1203
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:30,712
Come. Come, sir. Sit.

1204
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:32,311
Come, sir. Sit.

1205
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:33,938
Sir, you're so handsome.

1206
01:10:34,034 --> 01:10:35,843
What a suit, sir. Sir,
shoulder massage?

1207
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,311
Sir, head massage?

1208
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:39,836
What sir?

1209
01:10:40,134 --> 01:10:43,172
Ashok. Kumar. Are you two alright?

1210
01:10:43,234 --> 01:10:45,214
We're absolutely fine, sir.

1211
01:10:45,334 --> 01:10:48,577
Sir, your reality show 'Kaun
Banega Millionaire'..

1212
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:50,212
...Is just fantastic.

1213
01:10:50,734 --> 01:10:51,735
Reality show?

1214
01:10:52,267 --> 01:10:54,042
Ashok. Kumar.

1215
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,246
You do know who I am? - Of course, sir.

1216
01:10:57,367 --> 01:10:59,108
Everyone knows who you are.

1217
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:01,340
You're the owner of Channel 9.

1218
01:11:01,401 --> 01:11:03,108
When Shivani released
us from the asylum.

1219
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:07,445
...and Shanaya chose us as
participants we knew..

1220
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:10,739
That our luck's going to change.

1221
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:13,814
Our luck's going to change.

1222
01:11:14,401 --> 01:11:16,039
We can dance too, sir.

1223
01:11:16,667 --> 01:11:18,874
See, we're such good contestants.

1224
01:11:18,901 --> 01:11:20,278
We even have good set of teethes.

1225
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,846
Look at our muscles, sir.

1226
01:11:26,467 --> 01:11:28,037
What are you two doing?

1227
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:29,546
Look at us fight.

1228
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:33,737
And look at this, sir.

1229
01:11:35,234 --> 01:11:36,736
What are you two doing?

1230
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:39,244
And, look at this amazing death scene.

1231
01:11:39,401 --> 01:11:40,379
Ready? Ready?

1232
01:11:43,867 --> 01:11:44,868
What are you guys doing?

1233
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:46,778
We showed you everything.

1234
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,536
Please let us win this show.

1235
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,943
Let us win this show.

1236
01:11:50,034 --> 01:11:53,106
Look..we can do anything
to win this show.

1237
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:56,041
What do you two mean? What can I do?

1238
01:11:56,267 --> 01:11:58,269
I get it. I get it. - What can I do?

1239
01:11:58,567 --> 01:12:00,808
You won't agree so easily.

1240
01:12:06,767 --> 01:12:08,144
What are you doing?

1241
01:12:08,467 --> 01:12:11,471
What are you two doing?
What are you doing?

1242
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,945
We're buttering you, sir.

1243
01:12:13,134 --> 01:12:15,637
It's absolutely fresh, sir.
Made from buffalo's milk.

1244
01:12:15,667 --> 01:12:16,737
What nonsense is this?

1245
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,406
We even buttered you up now.
Please let us win the show.

1246
01:12:19,434 --> 01:12:21,038
Please, sir. - Okay, okay, okay. Fine.

1247
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,340
Oh, God!

1248
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,142
Please let us win, sir. - I'll
show you another trick.

1249
01:12:25,267 --> 01:12:26,041
Look.

1250
01:12:26,067 --> 01:12:27,011
Look.

1251
01:12:27,034 --> 01:12:28,604
I'll pull this table-cloth out.

1252
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,078
...and none of the utensil
will fall. Okay.

1253
01:12:31,267 --> 01:12:34,077
Abracadabra.hocus-pocus.

1254
01:12:35,901 --> 01:12:37,312
They are completely mad.

1255
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,274
It worked the last time.

1256
01:12:40,067 --> 01:12:42,013
There were no utensils
on the table last time.

1257
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:51,237
Hello. - Khan.

1258
01:12:51,301 --> 01:12:53,747
Did you find out how Ashok and Kumar..

1259
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:55,575
...were released from the mental asylum?

1260
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:56,907
Actually, they weren't released.

1261
01:12:56,967 --> 01:12:58,105
"They had escaped.

1262
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:00,936
But last night, I brought
them back to the asylum.

1263
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:03,071
“With the help of the warden.

1264
01:13:03,334 --> 01:13:05,371
Then tell me something you rascal.

1265
01:13:05,934 --> 01:13:08,915
What are those two doing
in garden right now?

1266
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:09,804
What?

1267
01:13:09,867 --> 01:13:12,074
I mean they are right here.

1268
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:13,770
But how's that possible?

1269
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,479
They are right before my eyes
in the asylum's B-wing.

1270
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:18,702
What nonsense.

1271
01:13:19,467 --> 01:13:20,468
Honestly.

1272
01:13:20,701 --> 01:13:22,271
Come and see for yourself.

1273
01:13:22,334 --> 01:13:23,335
What?

1274
01:13:27,067 --> 01:13:28,637
What are you blabbering?
Those two are here?

1275
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:29,737
Do you know what they've
done to me at home?

1276
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,938
They buttered my face.

1277
01:13:32,767 --> 01:13:33,768
What.

1278
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:58,004
Uncle!

1279
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:01,901
Ashok.

1280
01:14:03,634 --> 01:14:04,772
Thank God you're here.

1281
01:14:05,134 --> 01:14:06,374
What's happening with us?

1282
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,604
Why are we in a mental asylum?

1283
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:09,340
And..we were released.

1284
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,672
So why are we being kept here?

1285
01:14:10,734 --> 01:14:13,237
Ashok. Kumar. I am so
sorry about all this.

1286
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:16,448
This..is certainly the doing
of our rival companies.

1287
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,377
But you two don't worry.

1288
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:20,879
I will do my best to get
you two out of here.

1289
01:14:21,367 --> 01:14:24,211
And when I find out who
drugged your glasses.

1290
01:14:24,234 --> 01:14:26,805
...during the board meeting,
I won't spare him.

1291
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,940
I will get you two out of
here at any cost, okay.

1292
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,401
I'll be back.

1293
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:35,768
Uncle.

1294
01:14:36,634 --> 01:14:39,240
How did you know our
glasses were drugged?

1295
01:14:44,134 --> 01:14:46,580
Son..the doctor told me.

1296
01:14:48,467 --> 01:14:50,140
How could I not see this coming?

1297
01:14:52,334 --> 01:14:53,870
You're behind all this.

1298
01:14:53,934 --> 01:14:55,675
No, no, Ashok. Of course not.

1299
01:14:55,834 --> 01:14:56,972
Dad's in coma.

1300
01:14:57,934 --> 01:14:59,470
I am in jail.

1301
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:01,874
So who will run the company?

1302
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,801
You!

1303
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:08,172
And the company's clause states that.

1304
01:15:09,034 --> 01:15:11,708
...If you lose your mental
balance, then"

1305
01:15:12,101 --> 01:15:15,446
You'll be given the temporary
power of attorney.

1306
01:15:17,467 --> 01:15:20,471
And soon..it will be permanent.

1307
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:27,872
Caught me! Caught me! Caught me!

1308
01:15:28,101 --> 01:15:30,672
Finally you two saw my true colors.

1309
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:33,106
But..look at the irony of life.

1310
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:35,205
I am the one that's caught red-handed..

1311
01:15:35,267 --> 01:15:37,247
...and you two are behind bars.

1312
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:43,278
Yes, I dosed you with that drug.

1313
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:48,812
And that drug was prepared by Dr. Khan.

1314
01:15:50,534 --> 01:15:52,013
He's a big rascal.

1315
01:15:52,234 --> 01:15:54,339
...Kunwar Amar Nath Singh.

1316
01:15:55,034 --> 01:15:57,537
KANS. (mythological villain)

1317
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,243
So how can you expect
any goodness from him?

1318
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:03,010
In the next board meeting.

1319
01:16:03,034 --> 01:16:06,140
...I'll be the new boss of Singhania
Group of Industries.

1320
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:11,645
And you..will officially handover
the entire property to me.

1321
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:14,273
Now you'll ask how.

1322
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:17,772
We have your look-alikes.

1323
01:16:20,234 --> 01:16:21,304
And right now..

1324
01:16:22,134 --> 01:16:23,511
"They are at your house.

1325
01:16:24,601 --> 01:16:26,478
And it's no rocket science
to understand.

1326
01:16:27,134 --> 01:16:28,169
...that they are the
real mental patients.

1327
01:16:28,234 --> 01:16:29,907
And you're being held
here in their place.

1328
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,645
You know what I mean.

1329
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:33,408
Two Double roles.

1330
01:16:33,634 --> 01:16:36,843
And coincidently, do you
know what their names are?

1331
01:16:37,534 --> 01:16:40,378
Ashok..and Kumar!

1332
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:45,037
Now..I'm going to use
those stupid doubles.

1333
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,477
...and seize the entire property.

1334
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,410
And yes..after last night's
'great escape'..

1335
01:16:54,434 --> 01:16:56,141
"There's no chance of escaping again.

1336
01:16:56,367 --> 01:16:59,712
Because all the security
locks have been changed.

1337
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:02,471
Now you two will rot here.

1338
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,338
See you guys like..

1339
01:17:06,334 --> 01:17:07,335
Never!

1340
01:17:21,834 --> 01:17:24,610
I've seen and heard everything.

1341
01:17:27,234 --> 01:17:28,406
What are you doing?

1342
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,441
I want to show you two something.

1343
01:17:30,834 --> 01:17:32,006
Come with me

1344
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,541
Consider me a friend. Come on.

1345
01:17:36,101 --> 01:17:37,102
Come.

1346
01:18:19,834 --> 01:18:21,745
There aren't just two look-alikes here.

1347
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:23,168
There are three.

1348
01:18:47,934 --> 01:18:49,914
This is the most dangerous..

1349
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:51,470
...and insane patient
of this institution.

1350
01:18:51,767 --> 01:18:55,214
That's why he's been
kept in secret ward C.

1351
01:18:55,834 --> 01:18:56,835
Johnny!

1352
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:02,445
When I saw your uncle, I couldn't
believe my eyes either.

1353
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:04,977
Just like you two can't believe it.

1354
01:19:26,801 --> 01:19:28,678
Get ready KANS.

1355
01:19:28,967 --> 01:19:31,277
If you have our look-alikes ..

1356
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:33,812
"Then we've your look-alike.

1357
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:35,506
The real fun begins.

1358
01:19:50,034 --> 01:19:51,672
Ashok. Kumar.

1359
01:19:52,034 --> 01:19:53,479
Cyrus has told me everything.

1360
01:19:53,567 --> 01:19:55,046
...that happened with you.

1361
01:19:55,134 --> 01:19:57,410
Somehow I feel very guilty.

1362
01:19:57,567 --> 01:19:59,444
Confused by your look-alikes..

1363
01:19:59,467 --> 01:20:02,209
...I released the other Ashok and Kumar.

1364
01:20:02,334 --> 01:20:03,813
Now that you know everything.

1365
01:20:03,834 --> 01:20:05,472
...I'm sure you understand that.

1366
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:07,680
...how important Johnny's for us.

1367
01:20:07,867 --> 01:20:11,144
Doctor, if we train Johnny
to act like my uncle..

1368
01:20:11,734 --> 01:20:13,611
"Then will you help
us get out of here?

1369
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:14,768
Of course.

1370
01:20:14,834 --> 01:20:16,973
I am with you. - Thank you.

1371
01:20:17,034 --> 01:20:18,035
Hold on.

1372
01:20:18,467 --> 01:20:20,344
No one can help anyone here.

1373
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,569
I admit that I took you to see Johnny..

1374
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,638
"But I don't think he's
of any use to you.

1375
01:20:26,734 --> 01:20:29,214
Why? - He's got 3rd stage OCD

1376
01:20:29,234 --> 01:20:31,908
What? 3rd stage OCD? - Yes, doctor.

1377
01:20:32,067 --> 01:20:33,910
3rd stage? OCD?

1378
01:20:34,234 --> 01:20:35,474
What's that?

1379
01:20:35,767 --> 01:20:38,611
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

1380
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,476
An illness to stay clean.

1381
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:42,974
They are scared of germs. Wear gloves.

1382
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:45,207
Yes, but that's stage one.

1383
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:48,275
Stage two patients are
a threat to themselves.

1384
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:50,977
Like..they'll rub soap so hard..

1385
01:20:51,034 --> 01:20:52,513
...that they'll bleed themselves.

1386
01:20:52,934 --> 01:20:54,436
But stage three.

1387
01:20:54,901 --> 01:20:57,279
Stage three cases are very rare.

1388
01:20:57,434 --> 01:20:58,640
Almost one in a million.

1389
01:20:58,734 --> 01:21:00,805
Their condition is so worse.

1390
01:21:00,834 --> 01:21:03,872
...that if someone sneezes, they feel..

1391
01:21:03,934 --> 01:21:07,040
...he's trying to kill them
by spreading germs.

1392
01:21:07,301 --> 01:21:09,406
They attack to kill.

1393
01:21:09,534 --> 01:21:10,410
What?

1394
01:21:10,434 --> 01:21:14,280
And Johnny has already attacked
seventeen people.

1395
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:15,437
What nonsense.

1396
01:21:15,601 --> 01:21:18,207
If someone sneezes Johnny
Will kill him?

1397
01:21:18,267 --> 01:21:19,302
Yes. - Yes.

1398
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:24,114
And anyway, how can you use someone..

1399
01:21:24,634 --> 01:21:26,739
...who attacks even if someone sneezes?

1400
01:21:26,901 --> 01:21:27,902
Simple.

1401
01:21:31,067 --> 01:21:32,341
We won't sneeze.

1402
01:21:38,934 --> 01:21:40,436
Please don't sneeze.

1403
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:42,037
Don't sneeze.

1404
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,042
Don't sneeze.

1405
01:21:43,067 --> 01:21:43,943
Don't.

1406
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:45,105
Why will I sneeze?

1407
01:21:57,401 --> 01:21:59,938
Please, leave it to us.

1408
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:15,540
Hi, Johnny.

1409
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,147
I am Ashok, this is Kumar.

1410
01:22:20,567 --> 01:22:21,568
Hi.

1411
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,838
We're from Ward-B.

1412
01:22:24,034 --> 01:22:27,538
Actually, our look-alikes
are in Ward-B.

1413
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:29,975
Actually, they aren't in Ward-B either.

1414
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,270
They are at hour home.

1415
01:22:31,467 --> 01:22:33,504
And we're stuck in their place instead.

1416
01:22:33,967 --> 01:22:35,776
And the one that got us in here..

1417
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:37,479
...has a look-alike too.

1418
01:22:37,734 --> 01:22:38,974
Do you know who?

1419
01:22:41,267 --> 01:22:42,268
You!

1420
01:22:43,267 --> 01:22:45,838
Now we've two choices.

1421
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:49,170
Either we spend the rest
of our lives here..

1422
01:22:49,267 --> 01:22:50,837
...and turn crazy ourselves.

1423
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:53,436
Or we take revenge from the man..

1424
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,074
...that got us in here.

1425
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,107
And if we chose the second option"

1426
01:23:00,334 --> 01:23:01,745
"then we'll need your help.

1427
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,473
And if you help us, Johnny..

1428
01:23:05,734 --> 01:23:07,680
"Then I promise to get you treated.

1429
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:09,475
...by the best doctors in the world.

1430
01:23:13,834 --> 01:23:15,279
I'll take you some place.

1431
01:23:15,634 --> 01:23:18,240
...where you're treated
like a human being

1432
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,606
A place..which is absolutely clean.

1433
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,236
Where there's no din.

1434
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:29,737
No germs.

1435
01:23:33,934 --> 01:23:35,379
Where no one will ever sneeze.

1436
01:23:48,434 --> 01:23:49,970
I hate germs.

1437
01:23:50,834 --> 01:23:52,438
I hate germs.

1438
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:53,372
Johnny"

1439
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,711
Open the door. Open the
door. - Get out! Get out!

1440
01:23:56,901 --> 01:24:00,041
I hate germs!

1441
01:24:02,534 --> 01:24:04,775
It's not opening, it's jammed.

1442
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,370
Open the door.

1443
01:24:06,534 --> 01:24:07,638
He's gone berserk. Open it quickly.

1444
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:11,077
I hate germs!

1445
01:24:11,967 --> 01:24:14,743
I hate germs! - I am sorry.

1446
01:24:14,867 --> 01:24:16,312
I am sorry, Johnny.

1447
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:25,611
Johnny..son..listen to me. Let's talk.

1448
01:24:28,034 --> 01:24:29,377
No, no, no, no.

1449
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:45,069
Please stop, Johnny. - Lollypop.

1450
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:47,306
Please stop, Johnny. - Lollypop.

1451
01:24:47,401 --> 01:24:48,345
lollypop-

1452
01:24:48,434 --> 01:24:50,107
Get up.

1453
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:52,235
Saved.

1454
01:24:58,367 --> 01:24:59,971
He loves lollypop.

1455
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,301
What?

1456
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:03,701
Johnny.

1457
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,445
Will you help us?

1458
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:13,937
Did you catch anything? - No.

1459
01:25:14,534 --> 01:25:15,774
And you? - Yes.

1460
01:25:16,201 --> 01:25:17,441
What? - This rod.

1461
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,106
Ashok. Kumar.

1462
01:25:20,967 --> 01:25:22,503
Sir, you.

1463
01:25:22,634 --> 01:25:24,910
Where were you? - You ran away.

1464
01:25:24,934 --> 01:25:26,936
I've been looking all
over the house for you.

1465
01:25:27,334 --> 01:25:30,611
And you two are fishing
in this artificial pond.

1466
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:32,772
Sir, we're catching fish for you.

1467
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:34,503
Butter-fish, Indian Salmon.

1468
01:25:34,834 --> 01:25:36,313
Mackerel. Prawns.

1469
01:25:36,367 --> 01:25:37,471
Shut up!

1470
01:25:41,367 --> 01:25:43,677
What is this? What are you two doing?

1471
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,905
You said 'shin up', so
we pulled our 'shin-up'.

1472
01:25:45,967 --> 01:25:47,344
Lower it. Pull it down.

1473
01:25:49,034 --> 01:25:50,638
Are you here to pull such antics.

1474
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:52,213
...or win the show?

1475
01:25:52,434 --> 01:25:54,471
Win the show. - Then stop all this.

1476
01:25:55,167 --> 01:25:57,169
I've to star-t your training.

1477
01:25:57,367 --> 01:25:58,368
What training, sir?

1478
01:25:58,434 --> 01:26:00,072
Your training to be a millionaire.

1479
01:26:01,067 --> 01:26:02,876
Do you want to win this reality show?

1480
01:26:03,134 --> 01:26:04,135
Yes.

1481
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:06,044
You do want to make one million
Pounds, don't you?

1482
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:07,168
Yes, sir.

1483
01:26:07,234 --> 01:26:09,840
Our channel has received
thousands of sms'.

1484
01:26:09,934 --> 01:26:12,039
People really love you.

1485
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:14,436
WOW!

1486
01:26:16,334 --> 01:26:19,213
What..what are you two doing?
Again. Stop. Stop it.

1487
01:26:20,334 --> 01:26:21,608
Stand straight.

1488
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:25,507
If you behave like this,
wear such clothes.

1489
01:26:25,534 --> 01:26:28,572
"Then you'll be disqualified.
- Sorry, sir.

1490
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:30,908
From today I'm coming on
this reality show too.

1491
01:26:32,534 --> 01:26:33,342
You?

1492
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,641
But..not as the channel head.

1493
01:26:35,834 --> 01:26:37,871
But as Ashok's uncle.

1494
01:26:39,667 --> 01:26:41,271
His mother's.

1495
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,278
Brother.

1496
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,506
His uncle.

1497
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:47,971
In-shon, you've to do as I say.

1498
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,502
Without asking any questions. Okay.

1499
01:26:50,634 --> 01:26:52,477
Okay. - Sir, we'll do as you say.

1500
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,411
Just let us win this show.

1501
01:26:54,434 --> 01:26:55,538
Let us win. - I will.

1502
01:26:57,634 --> 01:26:58,704
Let go.

1503
01:26:59,067 --> 01:27:00,068
Nonsense.

1504
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,836
Just wait and watch.

1505
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:05,645
When you two attend all
the board meetings.

1506
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:10,013
...and par-ties with me, the
world will be shocked.

1507
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,404
...when I say..

1508
01:27:11,467 --> 01:27:13,777
Gentlemen, I proudly present to you..

1509
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:16,072
...Kuwar Amar Nath Singh.

1510
01:27:23,834 --> 01:27:25,472
Respected members of the board.

1511
01:27:26,467 --> 01:27:28,674
I'm pleased to tell you that.

1512
01:27:28,734 --> 01:27:31,738
...Ashok and Kumar are
completely cured now.

1513
01:27:32,367 --> 01:27:34,608
So I would like to request all of you..

1514
01:27:35,067 --> 01:27:37,138
...to once again handover
the power of attorney.

1515
01:27:37,234 --> 01:27:38,804
...to Ashok Singhania.

1516
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,176
Brilliant. - Yes.

1517
01:27:41,934 --> 01:27:42,935
Uncle.

1518
01:27:43,601 --> 01:27:44,272
Take it.

1519
01:27:44,334 --> 01:27:45,142
Thank you.

1520
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,543
Come on. Very good.

1521
01:27:46,634 --> 01:27:48,045
Now get back to your cells.

1522
01:27:48,101 --> 01:27:49,739
...before that Yamraj comes here.

1523
01:27:49,834 --> 01:27:52,007
You spoke my name.

1524
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:54,574
You thought of me.

1525
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,443
Sir, please don't torture us.

1526
01:27:57,501 --> 01:27:58,809
We beg you.

1527
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,537
But I have nothing to spare.

1528
01:28:04,434 --> 01:28:06,471
Boys, you know the drill.

1529
01:28:06,534 --> 01:28:07,535
Come on.

1530
01:28:07,567 --> 01:28:09,274
Don't touch him. Don't touch him.

1531
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,401
Johnny, go. Go.

1532
01:28:10,467 --> 01:28:12,242
Come on, take them away.

1533
01:28:16,901 --> 01:28:20,144
Hitler's favorite dish, chicken steak.

1534
01:28:24,001 --> 01:28:25,480
A lot of crazy people like you..

1535
01:28:25,534 --> 01:28:27,844
...make shoes and clothes
in the workshop.

1536
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:30,244
...for poor children of Burma.

1537
01:28:30,834 --> 01:28:32,711
And they're shipped from here daily.

1538
01:28:33,634 --> 01:28:38,242
But..l sell half of them right here.

1539
01:28:42,267 --> 01:28:44,747
First..I'll torture you three..

1540
01:28:45,034 --> 01:28:48,880
...and then ship you off
to Burma in these crates.

1541
01:29:25,367 --> 01:29:26,744
No!

1542
01:29:28,734 --> 01:29:30,805
No!

1543
01:29:36,267 --> 01:29:37,746
I hate germs!

1544
01:29:38,567 --> 01:29:40,672
I hate germs!

1545
01:29:41,534 --> 01:29:43,741
I hate germs!

1546
01:29:43,934 --> 01:29:45,971
I hate germs!

1547
01:29:46,067 --> 01:29:48,604
I hate germs!

1548
01:29:56,301 --> 01:29:57,302
I hate germs!

1549
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:58,674
I hate germs!

1550
01:29:59,067 --> 01:30:00,444
Johnny! No!

1551
01:30:00,534 --> 01:30:02,013
Johnny! You will kill him!

1552
01:30:02,101 --> 01:30:04,138
I hate germs! - Johnny, stop.

1553
01:30:04,234 --> 01:30:06,180
Doctor. Johnny! - I hate germs!

1554
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:08,304
Johnny. Lollypop.

1555
01:30:09,034 --> 01:30:10,035
lollypop-

1556
01:30:13,934 --> 01:30:15,607
Kumar, lift him by his arms.

1557
01:30:17,367 --> 01:30:18,539
What are you two doing?

1558
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,341
He was planning to send us to Burma.

1559
01:30:20,934 --> 01:30:22,174
Now he'll go to Burma.

1560
01:30:28,567 --> 01:30:30,843
Come on, there's a safe way to
escape through the bathroom.

1561
01:30:30,934 --> 01:30:32,504
Actually, the warden's right here.

1562
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,179
So we can go out the main-gate.

1563
01:30:34,234 --> 01:30:35,872
You can hide in the trunk of my car.

1564
01:30:35,934 --> 01:30:37,413
I will first clean the trunk.

1565
01:30:37,534 --> 01:30:39,138
Come on. Let's go.

1566
01:30:42,367 --> 01:30:43,368
Perfect.

1567
01:30:43,534 --> 01:30:44,774
Everything will be fine now.

1568
01:30:45,601 --> 01:30:46,602
Perfect?

1569
01:30:47,134 --> 01:30:48,340
You call this perfect.

1570
01:30:48,767 --> 01:30:50,804
Two days later that uncle of yours..

1571
01:30:50,834 --> 01:30:53,178
...will use your look-alike in
your Mauritius Beach Resort.

1572
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,679
...In front of your Board Members..

1573
01:30:54,801 --> 01:30:56,678
...and strip you of your for-tune.

1574
01:30:56,901 --> 01:30:58,278
You will be ruined in two days.

1575
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:00,337
You will lose everything.
And you call it perfect.

1576
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,905
Mishit, is your information correct?

1577
01:31:03,101 --> 01:31:03,806
Yes, sir.

1578
01:31:03,867 --> 01:31:06,177
I overheard your uncle discuss
the entire plan..

1579
01:31:06,267 --> 01:31:07,974
...over the phone with Dr. Khan.

1580
01:31:08,434 --> 01:31:10,573
Dinner Party on Friday.
Get-together on Saturday.

1581
01:31:10,667 --> 01:31:12,271
And all important conferences
on Sunday.

1582
01:31:12,501 --> 01:31:13,980
That's why I called it perfect.

1583
01:31:14,134 --> 01:31:15,807
We won't get a better chance.

1584
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,480
The three of them will be
together at the same place.

1585
01:31:18,501 --> 01:31:19,980
And with the board members.

1586
01:31:20,067 --> 01:31:21,273
We'll go there..

1587
01:31:21,334 --> 01:31:24,008
...and exchange places with our
look-alikes at the right moment.

1588
01:31:24,267 --> 01:31:27,805
And then Ashok, Kumar and Kans
will attend the conference.

1589
01:31:28,301 --> 01:31:30,781
And Johnny, as we discussed.

1590
01:31:36,367 --> 01:31:38,904
In the meeting you'll tell the board
members that I am absolutely fine.

1591
01:31:39,067 --> 01:31:41,547
And the entire property should
be returned to me. Okay'?

1592
01:31:42,667 --> 01:31:43,873
What about those three then?

1593
01:31:43,934 --> 01:31:45,470
Back to the mental asylum.

1594
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:48,079
...where you will treat Ashok and Kumar.

1595
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:49,440
And what about Kans.

1596
01:31:50,234 --> 01:31:52,578
He'll rot in Ward-C forever.

1597
01:31:54,067 --> 01:31:56,047
Good plan. Done?

1598
01:31:56,401 --> 01:31:57,311
Done. - Done.

1599
01:31:57,334 --> 01:31:58,540
Done. - Not done.

1600
01:31:58,867 --> 01:32:02,371
Why? - If anyone sees you
with your look-alike..

1601
01:32:02,467 --> 01:32:04,777
"Then it'll be hard to recognize
which is the real one.

1602
01:32:06,367 --> 01:32:09,405
Fine, then we'll go there in disguise.

1603
01:32:09,634 --> 01:32:10,112
Done?

1604
01:32:10,134 --> 01:32:10,669
Done.

1605
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:11,608
Done. - Done.

1606
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:13,374
Not done. - What now?

1607
01:32:13,534 --> 01:32:15,673
Because all the bookings are strictly
done for company employees..

1608
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:16,904
...and board members.

1609
01:32:16,967 --> 01:32:18,310
Each person is accounted for.

1610
01:32:18,367 --> 01:32:20,472
So..you can't go there
in disguise either.

1611
01:32:22,767 --> 01:32:24,246
Sir, there's one way.

1612
01:32:24,334 --> 01:32:26,371
I had a word with the
resort manager today.

1613
01:32:26,434 --> 01:32:28,141
And they are hiring waitresses.

1614
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:31,802
If you don't mind..

1615
01:32:32,034 --> 01:32:32,774
So?

1616
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,303
You can go there disguised
as waitresses.

1617
01:32:35,334 --> 01:32:36,335
What?

1618
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:40,739
By the way, it's not a bad option.

1619
01:32:41,134 --> 01:32:42,841
You three will look really cute"

1620
01:32:42,934 --> 01:32:44,538
...in a waitress outfit.

1621
01:32:45,234 --> 01:32:46,406
It's not funny, doctor.

1622
01:32:46,534 --> 01:32:47,911
There's no other way, guys.

1623
01:32:48,334 --> 01:32:50,211
This is your only chance
to take revenge on Kans.

1624
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,540
Don't let it slip.

1625
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,601
So done?

1626
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:53,472
Done.

1627
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,501
Done.

1628
01:32:54,634 --> 01:32:55,635
Done!

1629
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,504
I'll wear a red frock.

1630
01:33:00,634 --> 01:33:02,705
Ladies and Gentlemen, can I
have your attention please.

1631
01:33:02,801 --> 01:33:03,802
Thank you.

1632
01:33:03,834 --> 01:33:06,144
To all our board members
and their families.

1633
01:33:06,201 --> 01:33:08,807
...a warm welcome to Mauritius.

1634
01:33:10,901 --> 01:33:12,209
Here, we're dressed as girls.

1635
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:13,402
What next?

1636
01:33:13,567 --> 01:33:15,638
Now go and flirt with those three.

1637
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:18,404
And render them unconscious
with chloroform.

1638
01:33:18,434 --> 01:33:20,107
Wow. Is it so simple?

1639
01:33:20,234 --> 01:33:21,804
Why would anyone flirt with us?

1640
01:33:22,034 --> 01:33:23,172
Because of this.

1641
01:33:23,534 --> 01:33:24,569
Pheromones.

1642
01:33:24,967 --> 01:33:27,004
What are pheromones?

1643
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:28,377
Haven't you seen that ad where..

1644
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,912
"The boy sprays a perfume on himself
and all the girls go crazy?

1645
01:33:30,967 --> 01:33:32,844
It's something like that..for boys.

1646
01:34:05,734 --> 01:34:06,804
Oh my, God.

1647
01:34:06,934 --> 01:34:08,242
You're a celebrity, aren't you?

1648
01:34:08,534 --> 01:34:10,980
I know you. You're Kumar.

1649
01:34:11,267 --> 01:34:13,406
You used to make 'Parathas'
at South Hall.

1650
01:34:13,434 --> 01:34:16,540
I used to, but now I am a millionaire.

1651
01:34:16,834 --> 01:34:18,040
Millionaire.

1652
01:34:18,967 --> 01:34:20,469
You aren't my husband.

1653
01:34:20,667 --> 01:34:24,114
What do you mean? -
Means..I'm a big fan.

1654
01:34:25,067 --> 01:34:27,206
Every time I ate your Paratha.

1655
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,870
...It made me feel like I
had grown 'Par' (wings).

1656
01:34:31,101 --> 01:34:34,446
Please, can I have one
autograph and one pic?

1657
01:34:34,667 --> 01:34:37,341
No autograph. I am hungry.

1658
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,477
I'll go have the buffet.
- Where are you going?

1659
01:34:42,534 --> 01:34:45,208
I mean..the buffefs that way.

1660
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:47,801
Where?

1661
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:50,435
Where?

1662
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,610
This way. See.

1663
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:10,648
Baby doll. You're absolutely right.

1664
01:35:11,601 --> 01:35:16,141
The buffefs right here.

1665
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,310
Someone might see us here.

1666
01:35:21,434 --> 01:35:22,640
This isn't right.

1667
01:35:22,701 --> 01:35:28,049
I can't do any better in this place.

1668
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,843
When do you want it? - What?

1669
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,675
Autograph.

1670
01:35:32,801 --> 01:35:34,542
Oh! I was scared.

1671
01:35:34,967 --> 01:35:35,968
Listen.

1672
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:39,104
My pen and paper is in the cabin.

1673
01:35:39,634 --> 01:35:41,079
Come to my cabin.

1674
01:35:41,167 --> 01:35:43,374
'Good deeds need no invitation.'

1675
01:35:43,867 --> 01:35:45,710
But no smooch here.

1676
01:35:46,167 --> 01:35:47,703
Come on. - Let's go.

1677
01:35:47,834 --> 01:35:49,142
Come on. - Let's go.

1678
01:35:49,267 --> 01:35:50,837
Come on. - Let's go.

1679
01:35:51,934 --> 01:35:55,711
Oh my, God. I am so sorry.

1680
01:36:22,901 --> 01:36:26,747
I am so sorry, I ruined your shin.

1681
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,002
Then clean it.

1682
01:36:30,067 --> 01:36:33,879
Not here, come with
me..to the washroom.

1683
01:36:34,067 --> 01:36:36,411
I'll clean it up.

1684
01:36:43,667 --> 01:36:45,943
Your perfume's really nice.

1685
01:36:46,034 --> 01:36:48,446
It's awakening the animal in me.

1686
01:36:48,501 --> 01:36:50,071
I bought it at the duty-free.

1687
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:52,011
Enough about duty-free.

1688
01:36:52,101 --> 01:36:54,274
...when is this beauty going to be free?

1689
01:36:54,467 --> 01:36:55,878
In a while.

1690
01:36:56,201 --> 01:36:57,839
Then make me another drink.

1691
01:36:58,034 --> 01:36:59,911
This is the local stuff.

1692
01:37:00,367 --> 01:37:02,540
I've got the international
stuff with me.

1693
01:37:02,767 --> 01:37:05,077
At the back, in the corner.

1694
01:37:05,267 --> 01:37:07,110
Then let's go in the corner.

1695
01:37:08,667 --> 01:37:11,079
By the way, what name should I write?

1696
01:37:11,267 --> 01:37:12,905
My name is Sona.

1697
01:37:13,667 --> 01:37:16,307
Gold in English, or sleep.

1698
01:37:16,534 --> 01:37:20,107
Sleep! That's what I want, baby.

1699
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,077
What are you doing? I am scared.

1700
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:24,273
What's happened, baby? What's happened?

1701
01:37:24,367 --> 01:37:27,280
Rich people like you
come here for a break.

1702
01:37:27,567 --> 01:37:30,275
And break our hearts instead.

1703
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,443
I am not that type of a guy.

1704
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,843
Even I am not that type of a guy.

1705
01:37:34,567 --> 01:37:36,513
I mean I am not that type of a girl.

1706
01:37:36,534 --> 01:37:39,606
Then what type of a girl
are you.. Chandi (Silver).

1707
01:37:39,734 --> 01:37:40,940
Virgin.

1708
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:43,070
Damnit!

1709
01:37:43,101 --> 01:37:45,047
Virgin Airlines, silly.

1710
01:37:45,167 --> 01:37:46,475
I was the airhostess.

1711
01:37:48,901 --> 01:37:50,938
But they fired me.

1712
01:37:51,167 --> 01:37:53,511
Why did they fire my sweetheart?

1713
01:37:53,734 --> 01:37:55,736
One day my ex-boyfriend.

1714
01:37:56,134 --> 01:37:57,442
Ex-boyfriend.

1715
01:37:57,734 --> 01:37:59,839
Met me on the flight.
So I yelled aloud.

1716
01:37:59,967 --> 01:38:01,002
Hi Jack.

1717
01:38:03,267 --> 01:38:05,713
You just hijacked me.

1718
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,506
Looking at you I feel.. if someone
like you comes in my life.

1719
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:11,905
Then you'll be ﬂoored.

1720
01:38:12,034 --> 01:38:15,015
No, he'll be the father of my kid.

1721
01:38:15,934 --> 01:38:17,641
You've a kid, Heera?

1722
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:18,768
No, no.

1723
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:22,541
No one's turned this
bud into a flower yet.

1724
01:38:22,801 --> 01:38:26,112
You're more like a cauliflower.

1725
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:28,378
'Gobi Ka Phool!' (Cauliflower)

1726
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:30,845
No.. I am a mistake.

1727
01:38:31,534 --> 01:38:34,037
I was born in a laundry.

1728
01:38:35,967 --> 01:38:39,210
Then I'll have to dry-clean your youth.

1729
01:38:40,667 --> 01:38:44,945
By the way what are your vital stats?

1730
01:38:46,167 --> 01:38:49,273
96-84-96.

1731
01:38:49,467 --> 01:38:53,108
Wow..what numbers.

1732
01:38:53,767 --> 01:38:56,941
I am big fan of these numbers.

1733
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:01,110
You're sweating so much.

1734
01:39:01,367 --> 01:39:02,437
Let me wipe it.

1735
01:39:08,434 --> 01:39:10,675
'Oh my, God! The chloroform
isn't working.'

1736
01:39:11,534 --> 01:39:14,515
Don't fear, come near.

1737
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:17,704
Put my passion in third top gear.

1738
01:39:17,967 --> 01:39:20,311
Sir, sir, please not today. - Why?

1739
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:22,806
Today's my 'Brath' (fast).
- What 'Brath'?

1740
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:24,509
Bad 'Brathi (Bad breath)!

1741
01:39:24,534 --> 01:39:26,514
Smell it. Smell it.

1742
01:39:27,134 --> 01:39:28,704
Smell it.

1743
01:39:29,867 --> 01:39:32,211
What's this way of making
me smell your perfume?

1744
01:39:32,601 --> 01:39:34,877
This is my favorite
perfume. - Which one?

1745
01:39:35,267 --> 01:39:36,678
'Dakaar' (Burp)-

1746
01:39:37,067 --> 01:39:38,740
Then make me smell it.

1747
01:39:39,067 --> 01:39:40,478
Smell it. Smell it.

1748
01:39:40,767 --> 01:39:42,610
Smell it. Smell it.

1749
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,673
Do you feel giddy?

1750
01:39:45,067 --> 01:39:47,513
Why would I feel giddy, darling?

1751
01:39:52,201 --> 01:39:53,202
What are you doing?

1752
01:39:53,267 --> 01:39:54,507
Playing hanky-panky.

1753
01:39:54,767 --> 01:39:57,373
Hanky-panky. Hanky-panky.

1754
01:39:58,834 --> 01:40:01,644
I want to play hanky-panky with you.

1755
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,143
No, no, not today.

1756
01:40:03,567 --> 01:40:05,205
Tomorrow. - Tomorrow where?

1757
01:40:05,267 --> 01:40:07,406
The place where no one goes.

1758
01:40:07,467 --> 01:40:10,277
If no one goes there, then
why are we going there?

1759
01:40:10,367 --> 01:40:12,745
So that..we meet in private.

1760
01:40:12,767 --> 01:40:14,440
Okay. I'm going Bye-

1761
01:40:14,501 --> 01:40:16,811
Where are you going, baby?

1762
01:40:18,167 --> 01:40:19,168
Let me go.

1763
01:40:19,534 --> 01:40:21,741
Please, let me go. I'll see you later.

1764
01:40:22,034 --> 01:40:24,571
Help! Help! Help! - Calm down, girls.

1765
01:40:24,701 --> 01:40:25,907
Calm down. - What happened?

1766
01:40:26,334 --> 01:40:27,335
It's true.

1767
01:40:27,634 --> 01:40:30,012
All men are such rascals.
- What happened?

1768
01:40:30,067 --> 01:40:31,671
No sooner they see a
girl in short skit-L.

1769
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:34,180
"They pounce on her like animals.

1770
01:40:34,234 --> 01:40:35,872
Girls. Girls, what happened?

1771
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:39,473
Her chloroform didn't work. Why?

1772
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:42,640
Oh my God. I just realized.

1773
01:40:43,267 --> 01:40:45,713
Pheromone kills the
effect of chloroform.

1774
01:40:48,034 --> 01:40:51,572
Girls. Girls. Girls, calm
down. Please calm down.

1775
01:40:52,334 --> 01:40:54,871
Tomorrow you keep romancing them.

1776
01:40:55,334 --> 01:40:58,008
...and..leave the rest to us.

1777
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,806
Please, please, sister, don't be late.

1778
01:41:00,867 --> 01:41:04,872
Otherwisehe won't be
able to face anyone.

1779
01:41:24,634 --> 01:41:26,773
We see stars in broad daylight.

1780
01:41:26,901 --> 01:41:28,574
All our aspirations are jolly.

1781
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:32,444
My hear-t simply wants more of you.

1782
01:41:35,067 --> 01:41:37,240
We see stars in broad daylight.

1783
01:41:37,334 --> 01:41:38,938
All our aspirations are jolly.

1784
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,573
My hear-t simply wants more of you.

1785
01:41:42,734 --> 01:41:46,307
Open the window to your hear-t
open the door to your heart.

1786
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,743
Door, door, door."

1787
01:41:51,334 --> 01:41:54,975
Open the window to your hear-t
open the door to your heart.

1788
01:41:55,034 --> 01:41:56,445
Door, door, door."

1789
01:42:00,034 --> 01:42:03,311
Your intentions are very devilish.

1790
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:06,674
My youth is unavailable.

1791
01:42:06,934 --> 01:42:10,143
I am a fragile belle. Do not tease me.

1792
01:42:10,434 --> 01:42:13,643
Our story will only last
a couple of seconds.

1793
01:42:13,834 --> 01:42:17,213
I know your intent. I
know you inside out.

1794
01:42:17,334 --> 01:42:20,508
I won't believe you no
matter what you say.

1795
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:22,376
My hear-Es guitar beckons you.

1796
01:42:22,401 --> 01:42:23,903
All our aspirations are jolly.

1797
01:42:24,067 --> 01:42:27,605
My hear-t simply wants more of you.

1798
01:42:27,767 --> 01:42:31,271
"Open the window to your hear-t
open the door to your heart.

1799
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:32,678
Door, door, door."

1800
01:42:32,834 --> 01:42:32,936


1801
01:42:50,234 --> 01:42:53,477
There is talk that you are a flirt.

1802
01:42:53,734 --> 01:42:57,113
You look one way and aim the other way.

1803
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:00,443
Go away for you won't succeed with me.

1804
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:03,843
Your eyes are wicked and you
have an ulterior motive.

1805
01:43:04,067 --> 01:43:07,537
I am the princess of angels.
My freedom is dear to me.

1806
01:43:07,667 --> 01:43:10,773
You are total disaster, my dear.

1807
01:43:10,867 --> 01:43:12,608
The bells of love toll.

1808
01:43:12,634 --> 01:43:14,238
All our aspirations are jolly.

1809
01:43:14,334 --> 01:43:17,838
My hear-t simply wants more of you.

1810
01:43:17,968 --> 01:43:21,609
Open the window to your hear-t
open the door to your heart.

1811
01:43:21,634 --> 01:43:23,045
Door, door, door."

1812
01:43:26,634 --> 01:43:30,207
Open the window to your hear-t
open the door to your heart.

1813
01:43:30,267 --> 01:43:31,678
Door, door, door."

1814
01:43:50,267 --> 01:43:52,042
Baby doll.

1815
01:43:52,801 --> 01:43:55,407
Mister, why did you bring
me on the terrace?

1816
01:43:56,601 --> 01:43:57,375
Jacuzzi.

1817
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,437
The water in the Jacuzzi's warm.

1818
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:00,705
So what are we waiting for?

1819
01:44:00,934 --> 01:44:02,311
Look, I am an Indian girl.

1820
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,537
I cannot do all this
before marriage. Yes.

1821
01:44:04,734 --> 01:44:07,340
Then why don't we take
rounds of the Jacuzzi.

1822
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:08,601
Shut up!

1823
01:44:14,834 --> 01:44:16,677
Welcome to my casting. - Ouch!

1824
01:44:17,834 --> 01:44:18,835
Ouch!

1825
01:44:18,967 --> 01:44:23,575
These Indian clothes don't
look good on you at all.

1826
01:44:24,734 --> 01:44:27,010
Let's take them off.

1827
01:44:27,067 --> 01:44:28,375
Mister. What are you doing?

1828
01:44:28,567 --> 01:44:30,274
Don't do this. Don't be so cruel.

1829
01:44:30,501 --> 01:44:31,980
Mister. Oh my, God!

1830
01:44:32,134 --> 01:44:34,205
I fell down.

1831
01:44:34,567 --> 01:44:36,774
You really are very lowly.

1832
01:44:36,934 --> 01:44:38,914
Mister, don't do it.

1833
01:44:43,667 --> 01:44:45,237
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1834
01:44:45,301 --> 01:44:47,144
Shock! Shock!

1835
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:50,835
Oh, God!

1836
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:53,446
Shock! Shock!

1837
01:44:53,634 --> 01:44:55,238
Oh, God!

1838
01:44:55,434 --> 01:44:56,708
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1839
01:44:56,767 --> 01:44:58,713
Oh, God! Oh, God! - Run! Run!

1840
01:44:58,867 --> 01:45:00,346
Shock! Shock!

1841
01:45:00,434 --> 01:45:01,435
Oh, God!

1842
01:45:01,467 --> 01:45:03,105
What happened? Where did those two go?

1843
01:45:03,134 --> 01:45:04,909
They ran out screaming. - Why?

1844
01:45:05,001 --> 01:45:06,241
I don't know. Those two are crazy.

1845
01:45:06,267 --> 01:45:08,338
Very good, our job just got easier.

1846
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,673
Let's change clothes quickly we've
to get to the board meeting.

1847
01:45:10,901 --> 01:45:12,505
I wonder what's happening with Johnny.

1848
01:45:21,867 --> 01:45:24,370
You can't do anything
now. The Dad's broken.

1849
01:45:24,434 --> 01:45:26,505
You're a bed yourself, darling.

1850
01:45:26,534 --> 01:45:28,810
No I am not, I am a sister.

1851
01:45:28,901 --> 01:45:30,244
And I am very sinister.

1852
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:31,936
Don't come any closer.
Don't come any closer.

1853
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:34,981
I'm no good to you. Don't
come any closer.

1854
01:45:41,701 --> 01:45:43,271
Don't sneeze!

1855
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,537
I hate germs!

1856
01:45:49,467 --> 01:45:51,003
I hate germs!

1857
01:45:51,134 --> 01:45:52,670
I hate germs!

1858
01:45:58,867 --> 01:45:59,868
He sneezed again.

1859
01:45:59,901 --> 01:46:01,471
He sneezed again. Run.

1860
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,070
Help. Help.

1861
01:46:03,134 --> 01:46:05,307
He sneezed again. Help me.

1862
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,476
Why does every woman run away from me?

1863
01:46:12,401 --> 01:46:14,312
I'm getting late for the meeting.

1864
01:46:21,067 --> 01:46:22,569
I hope Johnny's ready.

1865
01:46:28,867 --> 01:46:29,868
Ready?

1866
01:46:30,534 --> 01:46:31,535
Ready?

1867
01:46:32,401 --> 01:46:33,402
Shall we?

1868
01:46:33,567 --> 01:46:34,568
Let's go.

1869
01:46:44,834 --> 01:46:46,780
Help. - Johnny.

1870
01:46:46,867 --> 01:46:48,904
Help. - Johnny, wait.

1871
01:46:49,334 --> 01:46:50,404
Johnny, what are you doing here?

1872
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,173
You should be upstairs with uncle Kans.

1873
01:46:52,267 --> 01:46:55,146
He threw me on the bed. I fell down.

1874
01:46:55,267 --> 01:46:56,268
He sneezed.

1875
01:46:56,334 --> 01:46:58,405
I hit him. Then he lied down.

1876
01:46:58,734 --> 01:47:00,736
I can't do it.

1877
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,571
It's alright. Now do one thing.

1878
01:47:08,601 --> 01:47:10,410
Go inside. Here.

1879
01:47:10,634 --> 01:47:11,738
Take these clothes.

1880
01:47:11,967 --> 01:47:14,743
Get changed and take your
place in the conference.

1881
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,902
Ashok and Kumar must be
waiting for you, right?

1882
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:19,539
Will anyone sneeze there?

1883
01:47:19,701 --> 01:47:21,305
Not at all.

1884
01:47:21,734 --> 01:47:22,735
0K8?'-

1885
01:47:22,868 --> 01:47:23,869
Good boy.

1886
01:47:24,167 --> 01:47:25,271
Good boy.

1887
01:47:36,767 --> 01:47:38,576
Good morning.

1888
01:47:40,734 --> 01:47:43,010
Sorry for the delay, Gentlemen.
Please sit down.

1889
01:47:45,401 --> 01:47:47,506
Distinguished members of the Board.

1890
01:47:48,167 --> 01:47:49,612
The agenda of this meeting.

1891
01:47:49,734 --> 01:47:51,645
...Is to discuss the future leadership..

1892
01:47:51,767 --> 01:47:53,747
...of the Singhania Group of Companies.

1893
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:57,915
As you all know, due to their illness.

1894
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,573
"They had strange fits, they
were sent to a asylum.

1895
01:48:01,701 --> 01:48:02,702
They had to undergo treatment.

1896
01:48:02,801 --> 01:48:03,973
Doctors say there's been..

1897
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,037
...considerable improvement
in their condition.

1898
01:48:06,534 --> 01:48:08,275
Johnny's acting really well.

1899
01:48:08,767 --> 01:48:12,579
But..not enough to handle
the companies.

1900
01:48:14,367 --> 01:48:15,368
What?

1901
01:48:16,334 --> 01:48:21,374
I want that the temporary
power of attorney..

1902
01:48:22,001 --> 01:48:24,208
"Vested with me should
be made permanent.

1903
01:48:26,001 --> 01:48:29,915
And Ashok Singhania himself
will say this.

1904
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:31,671
Ashok.

1905
01:48:32,301 --> 01:48:33,302
Tell them.

1906
01:48:33,701 --> 01:48:35,703
This is what happens
if you trust a madman.

1907
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:45,004
We were sent to the mental asylum but
I think uncle's getting the fits.

1908
01:48:45,367 --> 01:48:46,607
What? Ashok?

1909
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:49,740
We're just as crazy as all of you.

1910
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:52,777
I am absolutely fine, Gentlemen.

1911
01:48:53,034 --> 01:48:54,809
And I want my power of attorney.

1912
01:48:54,901 --> 01:48:56,972
...to be rightfully returned to me.

1913
01:48:57,267 --> 01:48:58,337
Ashok? - Alright?

1914
01:48:58,567 --> 01:49:00,979
Now all those in favor
please raise your hands.

1915
01:49:02,834 --> 01:49:03,938
Thank you.

1916
01:49:04,134 --> 01:49:05,704
What are you all doing?

1917
01:49:06,001 --> 01:49:08,003
It's the question of
our company's future.

1918
01:49:08,267 --> 01:49:10,144
Please lower your hands. Lower them.

1919
01:49:10,367 --> 01:49:11,744
Down. Please, down.

1920
01:49:12,101 --> 01:49:14,308
I think Ashok's getting fits again.

1921
01:49:14,567 --> 01:49:17,514
Ashok, you were just saying.

1922
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:20,274
...that you can't even ride a cycle,
let alone run a company.

1923
01:49:20,367 --> 01:49:21,971
Hey uncle, enough of you.

1924
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,775
You think we'll just listen
quietly to whatever you say.

1925
01:49:23,901 --> 01:49:25,073
Kumar, stay out of this.

1926
01:49:25,367 --> 01:49:26,573
Why should he stay out of this?

1927
01:49:26,667 --> 01:49:27,737
Because he isn't family member.

1928
01:49:27,867 --> 01:49:28,902
He's like family.

1929
01:49:28,934 --> 01:49:30,311
Like family, but he isn't family.

1930
01:49:30,334 --> 01:49:31,836
Get lost you..

1931
01:49:32,067 --> 01:49:34,946
To hell with the reality
show. - Don't say that.

1932
01:49:35,067 --> 01:49:36,375
We're so close to winning.

1933
01:49:36,401 --> 01:49:39,143
And if we don't go for the meeting
we'll be disqualified.

1934
01:49:39,301 --> 01:49:42,043
Come on, please. Please, let's go.

1935
01:49:42,267 --> 01:49:43,746
Okay. - Thank you, let's go.

1936
01:49:53,167 --> 01:49:54,168
Sorry. - Serf'!-

1937
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:58,171
We'll never do it again.
- I'll never do it again.

1938
01:49:59,034 --> 01:50:00,342
Shall we go for the meeting?

1939
01:50:03,601 --> 01:50:05,080
Stop it! - He cannot
talk to me like this.

1940
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:06,477
Calm down.

1941
01:50:06,701 --> 01:50:07,679
Hold on!

1942
01:50:07,734 --> 01:50:09,304
Hold on! Wait. Please.

1943
01:50:09,634 --> 01:50:11,272
There's a small confusion.

1944
01:50:11,701 --> 01:50:14,682
Please step outside and sort
out this confusion peacefully.

1945
01:50:14,801 --> 01:50:15,939
Please step outside.

1946
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:18,077
Come outside right now. - Let's go.

1947
01:50:18,101 --> 01:50:19,478
Come outside right now. - Yes, come.

1948
01:50:22,267 --> 01:50:24,406
I am sorry, it's just
a misunderstanding.

1949
01:50:27,934 --> 01:50:29,709
Wow! That was fast.

1950
01:50:30,434 --> 01:50:31,845
Is it all sorted?

1951
01:50:35,634 --> 01:50:37,170
So what have you all decided?

1952
01:50:42,901 --> 01:50:45,040
Distinguished members of the board.

1953
01:50:45,401 --> 01:50:49,110
As you all know, due to their illness.

1954
01:50:49,201 --> 01:50:51,738
"They suffered strange fits.

1955
01:50:51,834 --> 01:50:53,438
They were sent to the mental asylum.

1956
01:50:53,601 --> 01:50:55,046
They had to undergo treatment.

1957
01:50:55,201 --> 01:50:56,839
The doctors say that.

1958
01:50:57,134 --> 01:51:00,877
...there's been considerable improvement
in their condition.

1959
01:51:00,967 --> 01:51:03,311
In fact, the improvemenfs so good..

1960
01:51:03,534 --> 01:51:07,243
...that they can run
the companies again.

1961
01:51:07,301 --> 01:51:07,802
What?

1962
01:51:07,834 --> 01:51:10,508
I would like to request you all..

1963
01:51:10,934 --> 01:51:15,906
...to return the temporary
power of attorney..

1964
01:51:15,967 --> 01:51:19,141
"Vested with me back to Ashok.

1965
01:51:19,234 --> 01:51:20,679
What are you doing?

1966
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:24,646
Uncle taught us something else..

1967
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:26,442
...and now he's saying
something different.

1968
01:51:26,501 --> 01:51:30,677
I think..he's gone crazy
after that fat girl.

1969
01:51:30,701 --> 01:51:31,702
Yes.

1970
01:51:31,867 --> 01:51:34,143
But you say what you've been taught.

1971
01:51:34,234 --> 01:51:36,874
All those in favor please
raise your hands.

1972
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,172
My God!

1973
01:51:40,934 --> 01:51:43,346
Get up. - No, no, no,
what are you all doing?

1974
01:51:43,367 --> 01:51:45,540
Hands down, hands down. You also down.

1975
01:51:45,567 --> 01:51:46,511
Hands down.

1976
01:51:46,534 --> 01:51:49,105
Hey baldy, lower your hand.

1977
01:51:49,968 --> 01:51:51,641
I admit we aren't mad..

1978
01:51:51,867 --> 01:51:53,574
But we're still crazy.

1979
01:51:53,601 --> 01:51:55,137
So I suggest that you..

1980
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:58,614
...make this temporary power
of attorney permanent.

1981
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:00,875
...and give it to uncle.

1982
01:52:00,934 --> 01:52:04,177
What are you saying?

1983
01:52:04,867 --> 01:52:05,902
No, no, no.

1984
01:52:06,501 --> 01:52:09,311
Give it to them.

1985
01:52:09,534 --> 01:52:11,514
No, no, no, no.

1986
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:13,872
Give it to him.

1987
01:52:14,567 --> 01:52:15,272
Stop it. - Come on.

1988
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,075
Why you.. - Enough! Enough!
Enough! Enough!

1989
01:52:17,167 --> 01:52:18,168
What are you doing?

1990
01:52:18,267 --> 01:52:20,110
You got so engrossed
in uncle's character.

1991
01:52:20,167 --> 01:52:21,874
...that you forgot you're
his look-alike.

1992
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,643
You're Johnny from Ward-C.

1993
01:52:25,867 --> 01:52:27,244
We got you out of jail.

1994
01:52:27,401 --> 01:52:28,277
We trained you.

1995
01:52:28,301 --> 01:52:29,575
We were going to make your life better.

1996
01:52:29,634 --> 01:52:31,477
And you were uttering
rubbish in the meeting.

1997
01:52:31,567 --> 01:52:34,411
Now look, you know what
to do once you're inside.

1998
01:52:34,601 --> 01:52:36,410
You've to handover all
the companies to me.

1999
01:52:36,767 --> 01:52:37,802
Understand?

2000
01:52:38,667 --> 01:52:39,668
Yes.

2001
01:52:40,734 --> 01:52:43,044
Now. <i>.</i> I understand everything.

2002
01:52:43,467 --> 01:52:44,969
Good. Now let's go inside.

2003
01:52:46,734 --> 01:52:47,735
Come on.

2004
01:52:54,667 --> 01:52:55,873
I beg your pardon, sir.

2005
01:52:56,001 --> 01:52:57,480
Let me clean it. Let me clean it.

2006
01:53:03,934 --> 01:53:05,675
Oh..

2007
01:53:18,034 --> 01:53:20,310
But you should get the companies.

2008
01:53:20,401 --> 01:53:22,312
No, no, no. You should
get the companies.

2009
01:53:22,401 --> 01:53:25,507
But what will I do with
these companies?

2010
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:28,604
But what will I do with
these companies.

2011
01:53:28,634 --> 01:53:30,341
Will you all shut up!

2012
01:53:32,134 --> 01:53:33,511
There's a limit to everything!

2013
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:36,538
I am extremely sorry.

2014
01:53:37,434 --> 01:53:40,108
I think there's still some confusion.

2015
01:53:41,367 --> 01:53:43,313
Please step outside.

2016
01:53:43,868 --> 01:53:47,543
...and son this confusion
out peacefully.

2017
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:50,380
Uncle, you first.

2018
01:53:50,867 --> 01:53:53,973
No, no, no, you first.

2019
01:53:54,067 --> 01:53:55,603
No, no, no, uncle..

2020
01:53:55,701 --> 01:53:58,204
I beg you. Please.

2021
01:53:58,601 --> 01:54:01,013
For God sake.. please
go out and son this.

2022
01:54:01,167 --> 01:54:02,544
Please step outside.

2023
01:54:09,034 --> 01:54:10,035
lam..

2024
01:54:14,534 --> 01:54:15,535
What?

2025
01:54:18,701 --> 01:54:19,907
They are the real ones.

2026
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:21,178
What?

2027
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:23,441
They are the real Ashok and Kumar.

2028
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,238
I wonder where those crazy
fellows disappeared to.

2029
01:54:25,667 --> 01:54:28,273
Do something or we'll lose
the entire for-tune.

2030
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:30,075
Do something. - Relax,
I'll do something.

2031
01:54:30,434 --> 01:54:31,708
Members of the board.

2032
01:54:32,567 --> 01:54:36,208
All the confusion is
now completely cured.

2033
01:54:36,634 --> 01:54:38,614
The man who's been dreaming..

2034
01:54:38,634 --> 01:54:40,807
...to be the chairman of this company.

2035
01:54:41,767 --> 01:54:43,576
"Wants to say something to all of you.

2036
01:54:43,901 --> 01:54:44,902
Come, uncle.

2037
01:54:49,134 --> 01:54:51,774
Will you tell the truth.. or do I?

2038
01:54:55,334 --> 01:54:57,280
Come on, uncle, everyone's waiting.

2039
01:54:58,968 --> 01:54:59,969
Actually.

2040
01:55:04,501 --> 01:55:05,502
No, you take it.

2041
01:55:05,601 --> 01:55:06,636
What's going on?

2042
01:55:08,967 --> 01:55:10,605
Oh, God!

2043
01:55:10,634 --> 01:55:11,669
Shock! Shock!

2044
01:55:12,067 --> 01:55:13,512
What are you waiting for? Run.

2045
01:55:13,801 --> 01:55:15,610
Fire! There's a fire in the hotel.

2046
01:55:15,901 --> 01:55:17,005
Everyone get out.

2047
01:55:28,667 --> 01:55:29,668
He escaped.

2048
01:55:32,167 --> 01:55:33,874
Relax, Kuwar. - What relax?

2049
01:55:34,201 --> 01:55:36,442
That Ashok and Kumar came
up with my look-alike.

2050
01:55:36,901 --> 01:55:39,108
And I wonder where our crazy Ashok
and Kumar disappeared to.

2051
01:55:39,334 --> 01:55:41,075
Your Plan A and Plan
B failed miserably.

2052
01:55:41,167 --> 01:55:42,202
You're telling me to relax.

2053
01:55:42,401 --> 01:55:45,109
Look, Plan A and Plan B failed..

2054
01:55:45,534 --> 01:55:48,014
"But Plan C won't.

2055
01:55:48,401 --> 01:55:49,937
What Plan C?

2056
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,804
Ashok. Kumar.

2057
01:56:04,067 --> 01:56:07,207
Oh, these two fools were
hiding at your place.

2058
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,707
Hi, uncle.

2059
01:56:10,901 --> 01:56:12,505
You've put on weight again.

2060
01:56:12,801 --> 01:56:15,372
Let's go take..steam, sauna.

2061
01:56:15,467 --> 01:56:18,573
First we'll take steam.
and then sauna.

2062
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:24,712
Why are they talking like Chinku-Pinku?

2063
01:56:24,734 --> 01:56:26,805
Because they aren't your
crazy Ashok and Kumar.

2064
01:56:27,167 --> 01:56:30,080
In fact, they are my assistants
Chinku-Pinku.

2065
01:56:30,167 --> 01:56:30,941
Yes.

2066
01:56:30,967 --> 01:56:31,672
What?

2067
01:56:31,700 --> 01:56:33,008
How is that even possible?

2068
01:56:33,101 --> 01:56:35,547
When you were training those
crazy Ashok and Kumar..

2069
01:56:35,834 --> 01:56:38,747
...I was capturing their facial
molecular structure.

2070
01:56:39,101 --> 01:56:41,775
So that I could perform
plastic surgery on them.

2071
01:56:42,867 --> 01:56:44,175
Plastic surgery?

2072
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:49,671
Oh my, God.

2073
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:51,970
Oh my, God.

2074
01:56:52,267 --> 01:56:53,268
Oh my, God!

2075
01:56:54,501 --> 01:56:58,005
But..why do these two sound
like Ashok and Kumar.

2076
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:01,008
Voice modulator chip.

2077
01:57:01,234 --> 01:57:02,907
He stuffed it in himself.

2078
01:57:03,001 --> 01:57:04,776
This is really fantastic.

2079
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,073
Now tomorrow, at the House of Commons.

2080
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:09,171
...Chinku and Pinku.. No.

2081
01:57:09,501 --> 01:57:11,310
Ashok and Kumar will go with us.

2082
01:57:11,367 --> 01:57:12,675
And finally they will handover..

2083
01:57:12,734 --> 01:57:14,179
...the entire property to me. - Yes.

2084
01:57:14,234 --> 01:57:16,180
Don't forget my One million Pounds.

2085
01:57:16,301 --> 01:57:18,076
Why one million, Doc, I'll
give you two million.

2086
01:57:18,167 --> 01:57:19,168
You're a genius.

2087
01:57:19,267 --> 01:57:21,941
And..us?

2088
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,843
Yes, I'll give you two as well.

2089
01:57:24,267 --> 01:57:25,268
Really?

2090
01:57:30,534 --> 01:57:32,536
We're really going through a bad phase.

2091
01:57:33,934 --> 01:57:36,505
Uncle Kans knows we've his look-alike.

2092
01:57:37,034 --> 01:57:39,014
And actually speaking
he's no longer with us.

2093
01:57:39,467 --> 01:57:41,105
I wonder where Johnny disappeared to.

2094
01:57:41,767 --> 01:57:43,542
Things just cannot get worse for us.

2095
01:57:44,001 --> 01:57:45,981
Sorry, guys, they just did.

2096
01:57:46,934 --> 01:57:47,935
Look.

2097
01:57:55,067 --> 01:57:56,068
What the hell.

2098
01:57:56,367 --> 01:57:58,176
Kuwar Amar Nath Singh's the new owner..

2099
01:57:58,200 --> 01:57:59,975
...of Singhania Group of Companies.

2100
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:01,936
Official signing is tomorrow.

2101
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:03,679
At the House of Commons.

2102
01:58:04,867 --> 01:58:06,210
How did this happen?

2103
01:58:08,367 --> 01:58:09,505
Don't worry.

2104
01:58:10,034 --> 01:58:11,877
The official signing hasn't
taken place yet.

2105
01:58:12,201 --> 01:58:14,579
We still have one day to stop him.

2106
01:58:16,101 --> 01:58:17,774
But where do we find that crazy Johnny?

2107
01:58:17,934 --> 01:58:20,312
Dear, I've finished my
chores. Can I leave?

2108
01:58:20,667 --> 01:58:21,668
Yes, aunt.

2109
01:58:22,134 --> 01:58:26,105
That's my Balbir.

2110
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,646
Do you know Balbir?

2111
01:58:30,034 --> 01:58:32,275
No, aunt. You're mistaken.

2112
01:58:32,734 --> 01:58:35,840
He isn't Balbir, that's
their uncle Kans.

2113
01:58:37,534 --> 01:58:41,539
If he's Kans.. then you're
Shrupnakha(Demoness).

2114
01:58:41,567 --> 01:58:43,740
How long have I been your housemaid?

2115
01:58:44,167 --> 01:58:44,907
Ten years.

2116
01:58:44,934 --> 01:58:46,880
Have I ever lied?

2117
01:58:47,067 --> 01:58:50,378
But.. - I said that's my nephew
Balbir, then that's Balbir.

2118
01:58:50,767 --> 01:58:54,146
Aunt, I am sorry..but, are you sure?

2119
01:58:54,934 --> 01:58:56,140
Look at them.

2120
01:58:56,534 --> 01:58:59,674
How dare you doubt me?

2121
01:58:59,834 --> 01:59:02,747
You two are in the photo
too, so why ask me?

2122
01:59:02,967 --> 01:59:05,174
That's my nephew Balbir.

2123
01:59:05,367 --> 01:59:07,313
He runs a nightclub in South Hall.

2124
01:59:09,034 --> 01:59:10,035
See you.

2125
01:59:12,734 --> 01:59:13,735
Balbir.

2126
01:59:14,367 --> 01:59:15,573
That means..

2127
01:59:15,767 --> 01:59:17,110
Triple Role!

2128
01:59:18,701 --> 01:59:19,577
Bab'!-

2129
01:59:19,601 --> 01:59:21,012
Baby doll, don't do it.

2130
01:59:21,067 --> 01:59:22,341
Listen to me.

2131
01:59:22,567 --> 01:59:24,569
What are you doing? I'll be ruined.

2132
01:59:24,867 --> 01:59:27,541
You know..how important
today's function is.

2133
01:59:28,034 --> 01:59:29,240
Listen to me.

2134
01:59:29,434 --> 01:59:30,936
Hello. Hello.

2135
01:59:33,034 --> 01:59:34,035
Balbir.

2136
01:59:38,868 --> 01:59:41,144
Why are you all staring at me?

2137
01:59:41,234 --> 01:59:42,645
Who are you people? What do you want?

2138
01:59:42,734 --> 01:59:43,735
Same face.

2139
01:59:44,467 --> 01:59:45,571
Say it.

2140
01:59:45,867 --> 01:59:49,781
Balbir, we need your help.

2141
01:59:49,901 --> 01:59:50,902
Help?

2142
01:59:51,467 --> 01:59:54,971
A poor man has limited means.

2143
01:59:55,167 --> 01:59:57,443
I am not capable of helping anyone.

2144
01:59:57,534 --> 01:59:59,309
I need help myself.

2145
01:59:59,567 --> 02:00:01,240
The item girl of this dance bar..

2146
02:00:01,334 --> 02:00:04,941
...who's the main attraction
here signed a movie.

2147
02:00:04,967 --> 02:00:06,037
Sir, please listen to us.

2148
02:00:06,067 --> 02:00:07,978
When I came here from Ludhiana..

2149
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,345
...everyone said a dance bar will never
do good business in South Hall.

2150
02:00:11,434 --> 02:00:13,345
But I made it successful. I did.

2151
02:00:13,567 --> 02:00:16,207
And today's this dance
bar's 5th Anniversary.

2152
02:00:16,401 --> 02:00:18,278
The people will be here
in half an hour.

2153
02:00:18,434 --> 02:00:22,280
But the girl they're coming
here to watch isn't here.

2154
02:00:22,534 --> 02:00:25,708
Now..will I dance here in my shorts?

2155
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:29,472
I am ruined. I'll be humiliated.

2156
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:32,237
My dance bar will close
down. What do I do?

2157
02:00:32,267 --> 02:00:33,268
Balbir.

2158
02:00:33,734 --> 02:00:34,838
We can help you.

2159
02:00:36,001 --> 02:00:37,810
One minute. Guys, come here.

2160
02:00:42,234 --> 02:00:43,440
Your dance bar won't close down..

2161
02:00:43,534 --> 02:00:44,604
...nor will your show be cancelled.

2162
02:00:44,634 --> 02:00:45,977
Neither will you be humiliated.

2163
02:00:46,067 --> 02:00:49,742
But..if we help you, you will
have to help us in return.

2164
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,178
Anything-.

2165
02:00:51,201 --> 02:00:53,238
I am ready to do anything, I swear.

2166
02:00:53,434 --> 02:00:55,914
I'll do as you say, please.

2167
02:00:56,167 --> 02:00:57,805
But what are you all going to do?

2168
02:01:24,501 --> 02:01:26,447
By god, we will serve you.

2169
02:01:26,467 --> 02:01:28,071
Oh my queen Bullo.

2170
02:01:28,334 --> 02:01:30,211
By god, it will be a big hit.

2171
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:32,041
Our love story.

2172
02:01:32,167 --> 02:01:34,113
By god, come for my sake.

2173
02:01:34,134 --> 02:01:35,909
Come, come, come, come.

2174
02:01:36,067 --> 02:01:37,808
By god, don't break
my hear-t by leaving.

2175
02:01:37,901 --> 02:01:39,881
Don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go.

2176
02:01:41,301 --> 02:01:45,113
How can I simply give my hear-t to you?

2177
02:01:45,168 --> 02:01:48,945
My love will prove very dear to you.

2178
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:50,844
Go away, go 8W8'!-

2179
02:01:50,934 --> 02:01:58,284
Come, come. Come to
your lover's market.

2180
02:01:58,434 --> 02:02:04,510
Come, come. Come to
your lover's market.

2181
02:02:12,834 --> 02:02:16,475
Why do you produce new
stories every day?

2182
02:02:16,667 --> 02:02:20,240
Why do you come here to squander
your peace and solace?

2183
02:02:20,467 --> 02:02:24,108
You are my peace, you are my solace.

2184
02:02:24,234 --> 02:02:27,841
Come evening and my hear-t
leads me to your path.

2185
02:02:29,234 --> 02:02:33,182
How can I simply give my hear-t to you?

2186
02:02:33,201 --> 02:02:36,705
My love will prove very dear to you.

2187
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:38,743
Go away, go 8W8'!-

2188
02:02:38,901 --> 02:02:46,479
Come, come. Come to
your lover's market.

2189
02:02:46,567 --> 02:02:52,483
Come, come. Come to
your lover's market.

2190
02:02:52,834 --> 02:02:54,643
Come by car if not by scooty.

2191
02:02:54,667 --> 02:02:56,613
Cross the seven seas and come to me.

2192
02:02:56,734 --> 02:02:58,680
My hear-t beckons, come with love.

2193
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:00,304
Come, come, come, come.

2194
02:03:12,367 --> 02:03:15,871
Don't underestimate my attitude.

2195
02:03:16,234 --> 02:03:19,681
My love is razor sharp, not a mystery.

2196
02:03:20,067 --> 02:03:23,776
I am your confidant, I am your Romeo."

2197
02:03:23,900 --> 02:03:27,677
My heart truly loves you,
it is not a traitor.

2198
02:03:28,834 --> 02:03:32,475
How can I simply give my hear-t to you?

2199
02:03:32,668 --> 02:03:36,411
My love will prove very dear to you.

2200
02:03:36,434 --> 02:03:38,345
Go away, go 8W8'!-

2201
02:03:38,434 --> 02:03:45,875
Come, come. Come to
your lover's market.

2202
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:52,110
Come, come. Come to
your lover's market.

2203
02:04:10,167 --> 02:04:13,171
The mental asylum is much better
then this outer world.

2204
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:15,109
Yes, in there we're given
electric shocks.

2205
02:04:15,134 --> 02:04:16,772
...only if we make a mistake

2206
02:04:16,867 --> 02:04:19,848
Out here..we always get shocked
one way or another.

2207
02:04:19,967 --> 02:04:22,880
And then..my Shivani's here too.

2208
02:04:22,934 --> 02:04:24,504
Come on, let's go inside.

2209
02:04:24,767 --> 02:04:26,804
We don't want to win this
reality show. Come on.

2210
02:04:26,934 --> 02:04:28,811
That wasn't a reality show.

2211
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:33,136
Uncle! - No.

2212
02:04:34,534 --> 02:04:35,706
I am not uncle.

2213
02:04:35,867 --> 02:04:37,869
I am the uncle's look-alike, Johnny.

2214
02:04:38,167 --> 02:04:41,705
And you two are Ashok and
Kumar's look-alikes.

2215
02:04:42,534 --> 02:04:43,672
<i>Look-awes?</i>

2216
02:04:51,634 --> 02:04:53,875
We should help Ashok and Kumar.

2217
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:55,611
They are very nice people.

2218
02:04:55,667 --> 02:04:58,841
All our lives we've
done only bad things.

2219
02:04:59,268 --> 02:05:01,908
Now we've an opportunity
to do something good.

2220
02:05:02,334 --> 02:05:05,838
Let's go..and expose that rascal uncle.

2221
02:05:06,034 --> 02:05:07,911
Hello, boys!

2222
02:05:09,001 --> 02:05:10,605
I am back!

2223
02:05:14,767 --> 02:05:18,408
Because of you three,
the people of Burma..

2224
02:05:18,867 --> 02:05:20,778
"Left me unworthy of facing anyone.

2225
02:05:21,234 --> 02:05:22,235
What? - But now..

2226
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,311
...I'll take you three back..

2227
02:05:24,667 --> 02:05:26,977
...and I'll get my old job again.

2228
02:05:27,301 --> 02:05:28,405
Come on. - Shut up!

2229
02:05:29,434 --> 02:05:30,845
Shut up?

2230
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:34,210
You insect. Spineless creature.

2231
02:05:44,034 --> 02:05:45,604
Slapstick comedy!

2232
02:05:46,534 --> 02:05:48,104
Why you? - Stop.

2233
02:05:49,167 --> 02:05:50,407
You are mistaken.

2234
02:05:50,867 --> 02:05:53,177
L..l am Kuwar Amar Nath Singh.

2235
02:05:53,267 --> 02:05:54,905
And these two aren't
the Ashok and Kumar..

2236
02:05:55,001 --> 02:05:56,605
...from your mental asylum.

2237
02:05:56,801 --> 02:05:58,405
They are my Ashok and Kumar.

2238
02:05:58,501 --> 02:05:59,536
Millionaires.

2239
02:05:59,767 --> 02:06:00,609
But..but..

2240
02:06:00,667 --> 02:06:03,204
What but? Are you stupid?

2241
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:05,175
They Ashok and Kumar
you're looking for..

2242
02:06:05,201 --> 02:06:06,680
...are our look-alikes. - Yes.

2243
02:06:06,701 --> 02:06:09,181
Look-alikes. New story.

2244
02:06:09,201 --> 02:06:10,942
I'll tell your story to the world.

2245
02:06:11,067 --> 02:06:12,512
What the people of Burma did with you..

2246
02:06:12,534 --> 02:06:14,172
...should I put that on Facebook?

2247
02:06:14,301 --> 02:06:16,440
Should I put it on Whatsapp?
- Should I put it on Twitter?

2248
02:06:16,467 --> 02:06:18,344
He has many followers on
Twitter. I don't know how?

2249
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:19,743
But I do. I do.

2250
02:06:19,767 --> 02:06:20,768
Yes.

2251
02:06:21,067 --> 02:06:23,013
I hate social networking.

2252
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:25,778
Let us go, we'll go and
catch those look-alikes.

2253
02:06:25,801 --> 02:06:26,802
Halt!

2254
02:06:26,967 --> 02:06:30,676
Sir. Sir, take me along too.

2255
02:06:30,901 --> 02:06:32,812
For the sake of my tainted honor.

2256
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:35,646
When I find those three..

2257
02:06:35,734 --> 02:06:39,341
...I'll make their plight such that..

2258
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:41,408
Why are you scared?

2259
02:06:41,601 --> 02:06:43,672
I was talking about those look-alikes.

2260
02:06:43,767 --> 02:06:44,939
Follow me. - This way.

2261
02:06:45,067 --> 02:06:46,068
Follow me.

2262
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:54,479
Today, on the special occasion
of 15th August.

2263
02:06:54,534 --> 02:06:56,343
...I would like to welcome all of you.

2264
02:06:56,367 --> 02:06:58,347
I would like to call
the guest of honor..

2265
02:06:58,601 --> 02:07:01,207
...His royal Highness,
the Prince of Wales..

2266
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:03,980
...Prince Charles on stage
to say a few words.

2267
02:07:16,734 --> 02:07:18,145
Thank you very much, Ashok.

2268
02:07:18,967 --> 02:07:22,380
Ladies and Gentlemen, it really
is a great honor to be here.

2269
02:07:22,668 --> 02:07:25,774
The Royal family has always
made the effort.

2270
02:07:25,834 --> 02:07:27,836
...to strengthen the bonds between.

2271
02:07:27,867 --> 02:07:30,643
"The United Kingdom and India.

2272
02:07:33,434 --> 02:07:35,971
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

2273
02:07:36,234 --> 02:07:40,046
After ruining me Ashok and Kumar..

2274
02:07:40,134 --> 02:07:42,045
...are posing as millionaires.

2275
02:07:42,701 --> 02:07:47,844
I swear on God, they won't
escape my wrath today.

2276
02:07:48,967 --> 02:07:50,207
Thappa and his papa.

2277
02:07:51,501 --> 02:07:53,811
Did you fix the bomb properly
in the chandelier?

2278
02:07:54,134 --> 02:07:55,135
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

2279
02:07:59,834 --> 02:08:02,246
Now let's activate it
and get out of here.

2280
02:08:02,467 --> 02:08:05,175
The bomb will explode
in exactly two minutes.

2281
02:08:09,367 --> 02:08:11,745
Why isn't the light coming on?

2282
02:08:16,267 --> 02:08:17,439
Battery?

2283
02:08:17,467 --> 02:08:18,571
We don't have batteries.

2284
02:08:18,834 --> 02:08:22,338
Go buy batteries from the store.

2285
02:08:22,401 --> 02:08:23,402
Go on.

2286
02:08:23,767 --> 02:08:27,180
Like every year, we'll
donate a cheque.

2287
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,237
...to the Prince Charles
Charitable Organization.

2288
02:08:31,201 --> 02:08:35,047
But this year..l won't do
this good deed myself.

2289
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:39,009
In fact, the future boss of the
Singhania Group of Companies.

2290
02:08:39,667 --> 02:08:41,647
...Kuwar Amar Nath Singh
will do the honors.

2291
02:08:43,967 --> 02:08:45,969
What are you saying?
- Yes, your Highness.

2292
02:08:46,067 --> 02:08:49,947
Unfortunately, due to my degrading
mental condition.

2293
02:08:50,434 --> 02:08:52,846
...I had to take this step.

2294
02:08:53,067 --> 02:08:54,978
Today, in everyone's presence.

2295
02:08:55,334 --> 02:08:57,371
With Prince Charles as my witness.

2296
02:08:58,700 --> 02:09:00,202
Today, I officially handover..

2297
02:09:00,301 --> 02:09:02,611
...the Singhania Group proper-ties
and for-tune“

2298
02:09:02,901 --> 02:09:06,110
...to my uncle, Kuwar Amar Nath Singh.

2299
02:09:18,634 --> 02:09:19,635
Stop!

2300
02:09:31,434 --> 02:09:33,846
How can this man handover the fortune.

2301
02:09:34,334 --> 02:09:35,972
...when it doesn't belong to him.

2302
02:09:38,067 --> 02:09:39,671
He's absolutely right.

2303
02:09:43,401 --> 02:09:46,871
He isn't the real Ashok,
or the real Kumar..

2304
02:09:47,034 --> 02:09:48,775
...nor is he the real uncle.

2305
02:09:50,167 --> 02:09:52,078
Here's..the real Ashok.

2306
02:10:11,367 --> 02:10:13,142
Three people with double roles.

2307
02:10:18,001 --> 02:10:19,981
Your Majesty, these three
are escaped patients..

2308
02:10:20,001 --> 02:10:21,241
...from the mental asylum.

2309
02:10:21,401 --> 02:10:22,505
Impossible.

2310
02:10:23,067 --> 02:10:24,137
Is that true?

2311
02:10:24,334 --> 02:10:25,813
No. - No.

2312
02:10:26,267 --> 02:10:28,213
Your Majesty, they are lying.

2313
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,007
They are insane. - Yes.

2314
02:10:31,134 --> 02:10:33,944
Great. Blaming us instead.

2315
02:10:34,067 --> 02:10:35,876
Shut up, crazy. - You are crazy.

2316
02:10:35,967 --> 02:10:38,072
No, you're crazy. - You're crazy.

2317
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:39,577
You three are crazy. - Halt.

2318
02:10:40,967 --> 02:10:43,607
I'll tell you who's really..

2319
02:10:45,534 --> 02:10:47,036
What is going on?

2320
02:10:59,567 --> 02:11:00,568
One more.

2321
02:11:02,601 --> 02:11:03,636
What the"

2322
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:05,939
Three people with triple roles.

2323
02:11:06,134 --> 02:11:07,875
You said you have look-alikes.

2324
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:09,773
But even your look-alikes
have look-alikes.

2325
02:11:09,934 --> 02:11:11,777
That means three people
with triple roles.

2326
02:11:11,934 --> 02:11:13,379
Three times three!

2327
02:11:13,534 --> 02:11:14,376
We don't know that.

2328
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:16,744
But we do know that one group's
real and the other's fake.

2329
02:11:16,801 --> 02:11:19,338
Which group are you? -
We're the crazy group.

2330
02:11:20,334 --> 02:11:22,678
They are the crazy ones, not them.

2331
02:11:22,868 --> 02:11:23,869
They are the crazy group.

2332
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:25,504
We aren't mad. - How dare you?

2333
02:11:25,534 --> 02:11:27,514
Are you calling us crazy?
- Yes, you're crazy.

2334
02:11:27,534 --> 02:11:29,810
They are the crazy ones.
- Oh my God, confession.

2335
02:11:29,867 --> 02:11:31,312
They're admitting they are crazy.

2336
02:11:31,334 --> 02:11:33,974
We aren't mad. - We're just crazy.

2337
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,775
I am going crazy here.

2338
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:38,303
This is more confusing
than my first marriage.

2339
02:11:38,367 --> 02:11:40,176
Who's real? Who's fake?

2340
02:11:40,267 --> 02:11:41,405
We're real.

2341
02:11:41,501 --> 02:11:42,536
We're real.

2342
02:11:42,567 --> 02:11:43,568
We're crazy.

2343
02:11:43,667 --> 02:11:44,941
One of them is real.

2344
02:11:45,001 --> 02:11:47,174
Security! Security! Take them away.

2345
02:11:47,201 --> 02:11:49,181
rascal. - Why you..

2346
02:11:49,267 --> 02:11:51,008
I'll show you who's real.

2347
02:11:51,468 --> 02:11:53,448
Let go my collar.

2348
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:55,705
Let's go the asylum. - Is there a bed.

2349
02:11:55,734 --> 02:11:56,838
Come on.

2350
02:11:57,167 --> 02:11:58,703
Reality show uncle.

2351
02:11:58,934 --> 02:12:03,212
Once the batteries arrive
I will blow everyone up.

2352
02:12:03,467 --> 02:12:05,344
Are you Crazy or what?

2353
02:12:05,834 --> 02:12:07,074
We aren't crazy.

2354
02:12:07,101 --> 02:12:08,512
We aren't crazy.

2355
02:12:08,534 --> 02:12:10,377
This one's for Hitler.

2356
02:12:11,267 --> 02:12:12,610
This one's for Churchill.

2357
02:12:13,167 --> 02:12:15,374
Don't sneeze. Don't sneeze.

2358
02:12:15,734 --> 02:12:16,735
Who are you?

2359
02:12:16,967 --> 02:12:18,139
I am Ashok. - I am Kumar.

2360
02:12:18,267 --> 02:12:19,143
Which one?

2361
02:12:19,168 --> 02:12:20,169
Stop!

2362
02:12:34,367 --> 02:12:35,471
I'll tell you..

2363
02:12:36,334 --> 02:12:40,214
...who the real Ashok
Singhania, my son is.

2364
02:13:13,867 --> 02:13:15,403
This is my son, Ashok.

2365
02:13:15,801 --> 02:13:17,405
The real Ashok Singhania.

2366
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:19,602
Because only a son..

2367
02:13:20,367 --> 02:13:22,472
...sheds tears seeing his father.

2368
02:13:25,934 --> 02:13:26,935
Son!

2369
02:13:27,600 --> 02:13:28,601
Dad.

2370
02:13:39,867 --> 02:13:41,312
I knew, dad..

2371
02:13:41,901 --> 02:13:43,380
...that you will be fine some day.

2372
02:13:43,534 --> 02:13:44,672
I had to, son.

2373
02:13:45,834 --> 02:13:49,077
Otherwise I would have had to
listen to your rotten jokes.

2374
02:13:52,934 --> 02:13:54,914
Battery. - Battery, Give it.

2375
02:13:56,967 --> 02:13:58,002
Enough.

2376
02:13:58,467 --> 02:14:00,310
Enough of this father-son
emotional scene.

2377
02:14:03,201 --> 02:14:05,044
At least this clears one thing.

2378
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:06,636
...that you're the real Ashok.

2379
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:09,373
Now handover your fortune to me..

2380
02:14:09,534 --> 02:14:12,572
...or this will be the last
day of your father's life.

2381
02:14:12,767 --> 02:14:14,872
No. I'll sign.

2382
02:14:16,167 --> 02:14:17,168
Here.

2383
02:14:38,467 --> 02:14:39,070
Dad.

2384
02:14:39,134 --> 02:14:41,580
That's a bomb.

2385
02:14:50,467 --> 02:14:51,707
What's the matter!

2386
02:14:55,301 --> 02:14:57,975
Mr. Singhania's about to explode. Run!

2387
02:15:05,867 --> 02:15:06,937
Dad.

2388
02:15:15,201 --> 02:15:17,044
Oh my, God!

2389
02:15:19,434 --> 02:15:21,209
Oh my, God!

2390
02:15:30,667 --> 02:15:33,011
I can't touch this bomb. - Me neither.

2391
02:15:33,334 --> 02:15:34,335
Liar.

2392
02:15:36,234 --> 02:15:38,771
Move you idiots. - Someone save me.

2393
02:15:39,101 --> 02:15:40,774
It's after me.

2394
02:15:41,734 --> 02:15:43,577
Ladies and Sindhis first.

2395
02:15:43,734 --> 02:15:45,236
Let me go first, I am Sindhi.

2396
02:15:45,268 --> 02:15:47,214
I am Sindhi. - Get lost.

2397
02:15:51,734 --> 02:15:54,544
Move aside. Move aside.

2398
02:15:58,801 --> 02:16:02,010
I am never coming back to
an Indian function again.

2399
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:05,437
What's the hurry, sweetheart?

2400
02:16:05,534 --> 02:16:07,707
I am Thappa and that's my papa.

2401
02:16:07,868 --> 02:16:11,839
And now we'll brand you with our love.

2402
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:15,978
Don't worry girls, we'll save you.

2403
02:16:16,067 --> 02:16:17,205
How will you save us?

2404
02:16:17,867 --> 02:16:19,346
Madam, there are just.

2405
02:16:19,601 --> 02:16:21,638
This is not the time, dumbo.
Fighting. Fighting.

2406
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:22,701
0K8?'-

2407
02:16:23,734 --> 02:16:24,678
Where did they go?

2408
02:16:24,734 --> 02:16:25,974
Stop! Stop!

2409
02:16:26,501 --> 02:16:28,572
I don't like midgets. I hate them.

2410
02:16:28,601 --> 02:16:29,602
Leave them.

2411
02:16:34,768 --> 02:16:36,338
Hold me. Hold me.

2412
02:16:36,401 --> 02:16:38,472
Hi, I am Chinku. - I am Pinku.

2413
02:16:38,501 --> 02:16:39,673
Let me go. Let me go.

2414
02:16:39,767 --> 02:16:41,269
Move. Move aside.

2415
02:16:41,367 --> 02:16:43,643
The bomb can explode
any moment. Let me go.

2416
02:16:43,667 --> 02:16:46,238
I am a decent man. I am a decent man.

2417
02:17:01,534 --> 02:17:02,672
Please get me down!

2418
02:17:02,734 --> 02:17:03,769
Shut up!

2419
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:06,338
Forgive me. Forgive me.

2420
02:17:06,367 --> 02:17:07,311
Sorry. Serf'!-

2421
02:17:07,334 --> 02:17:09,336
Forgive me.

2422
02:17:13,367 --> 02:17:15,074
They bit us.

2423
02:17:15,201 --> 02:17:16,805
Let go. Let go.

2424
02:17:18,834 --> 02:17:20,609
Let go, I'll give you a chocolate.

2425
02:17:21,067 --> 02:17:22,876
Help. Save us.

2426
02:17:23,067 --> 02:17:24,876
Help, they will eat up everything.

2427
02:17:26,900 --> 02:17:29,847
Help me. Get this out.

2428
02:17:33,767 --> 02:17:35,644
Bomb. Bomb.

2429
02:17:35,867 --> 02:17:38,746
You got me in this. No.
You got me in this.

2430
02:18:42,101 --> 02:18:43,102
Bomb.

2431
02:18:44,067 --> 02:18:45,068
I am safe.

2432
02:18:45,201 --> 02:18:48,114
Uncle, don't slip back into coma again.

2433
02:18:48,234 --> 02:18:49,975
Otherwise we'll play videogames again.

2434
02:18:50,134 --> 02:18:51,408
Thank you, my children.

2435
02:18:51,534 --> 02:18:53,343
Ashok. Kumar. - Shivani.

2436
02:18:54,334 --> 02:18:55,836
Uncle.

2437
02:18:55,867 --> 02:18:58,404
Uncle, forgive us. Forgive
us. Forgive us.

2438
02:18:58,434 --> 02:18:59,879
If you forgive us..

2439
02:18:59,900 --> 02:19:04,110
...we'll clean your back every
day with castor oil.

2440
02:19:04,134 --> 02:19:05,135
Why not?

2441
02:19:05,634 --> 02:19:06,942
Yippee!

2442
02:19:07,068 --> 02:19:08,877
Where are you going?

2443
02:19:09,401 --> 02:19:10,505
Son. - Dad.

2444
02:19:10,667 --> 02:19:12,476
Are you okay? - Yes, son.

2445
02:19:12,901 --> 02:19:13,470
Dad.

2446
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:14,706
Take them to the asylum.

2447
02:19:14,734 --> 02:19:17,112
Oh, God! How did I get stuck in this?

2448
02:19:17,467 --> 02:19:18,673
And do keep visiting.

2449
02:19:19,534 --> 02:19:20,672
Good they were caught.

2450
02:19:20,934 --> 02:19:22,675
We've been saying that we're not mad..

2451
02:19:22,767 --> 02:19:25,145
We're just crazy. -
Don't worry, darling.

2452
02:19:25,267 --> 02:19:26,871
I'll fix that. - WOW!

2453
02:19:30,934 --> 02:19:31,935
Show-offs!

2454
02:19:32,034 --> 02:19:33,274
There's a big difference.

2455
02:19:33,334 --> 02:19:35,746
...between their 'wapa-chiki' and ours.

2456
02:19:41,567 --> 02:19:42,807
The most interesting thing is..

2457
02:19:42,834 --> 02:19:44,836
...we had so much action,
but no one sneezed.

2458
02:19:45,967 --> 02:19:46,911
No!

2459
02:19:46,934 --> 02:19:48,413
I am just joking.

2460
02:19:50,767 --> 02:19:52,542
Till now I had just one son.

2461
02:19:53,633 --> 02:19:55,806
But now I have four sons.

2462
02:19:57,467 --> 02:19:58,946
And yes, two daughter as well.

2463
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:03,801
Wow.

2464
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:05,675
I'll never get a bigger audience.

2465
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:07,474
I'll tell you a new joke.

2466
02:20:07,567 --> 02:20:09,342
No way man!
