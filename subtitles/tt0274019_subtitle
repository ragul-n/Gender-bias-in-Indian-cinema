00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:25,087
Hurry or I'II miss the job!

I have to get to DeIhi.

4
00:01:28,602 --> 00:01:30,593
''- Pay me the fare..!
- Take it, man!''

5
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:33,095
- Where are you going?
- Let me go!

6
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,602
''Try to understand,
I'II miss the train!''

7
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,099
First buy the ticket.

8
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:41,012
''No, try to understand
I'II miss the train.''

9
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:45,107

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:47,610

11
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,616
- What are you doing?
- This is a Iadies compartment.

12
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,621
You can't get in here. Get off.

13
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:02,625
Excuse me. I'd have missed
the train if I didn't get in

14
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:06,233
- So what?
- Is your girI friend waiting for you?

15
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,132
Look at him bIush!

16
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:13,571
You're oId enough
to have a girI friend.

17
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:16,909
ActuaIIy I don't have any.

18
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:18,983
He's so handsome.

19
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:22,077
My name is Sundar.

20
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:38,002
What styIe..

21
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:40,004
God..!

22
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:42,939
PIease take a seat.

23
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,610
Don't you just Iove artists?

24
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,958
I wiII onIy marry a viIIage boy.

25
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,358
One who is an artist.

26
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:08,032
Why a viIIager?

27
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:14,302
Because viIIagers are innocent.

28
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,007
And simpIe.

29
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:24,574
''They Iive in fresh air, eat
carrots and are so heaIthy.''

30
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:32,991
''And city foIk Iive in fIats,
eat chocoIates and turn soft.''

31
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:39,360
How is Sundar?

32
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:43,334
He's very nice.

33
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:46,367
Very handsome!

34
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:49,602
But why wouId he marry me?

35
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:51,342
We'II ask him right now.

36
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:55,345
WiII you marry Manju?

37
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:59,608
Do it. She's decent
and from a good famiIy.

38
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,113
and she has given you her
heart at first sight.

39
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:13,064
Don't break my heart.

40
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,565
- I won't.
- My Sundar!

41
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:22,064
Where is she going?

42
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,978
I had a great time.

43
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:35,054
I'm sure I made some mistake.

44
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:37,181
I shouId have carried your bags.

45
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:40,424
But the moment I turned
I saw no girIs. Not even you.

46
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:44,086
Never get so serious
in the first meeting.

47
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:47,931
We're students of MedicaI CoIIege
Went to Agra to see the Taj.

48
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,432
For a picnic.

49
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:52,595
- Enjoyed the trip?
- Yes.

50
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,605
That's aII. It was time pass.

51
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:03,014
''Let's go, driver.''

52
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,050
There's no other way.

53
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:18,326
We must Ieave this crueI worId.

54
00:05:19,232 --> 00:05:20,563
The scoundreI!

55
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:24,961
We'II buiId a IittIe nest
on the tree of Iove.

56
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:27,039
Son of a bitch!

57
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:30,566
Where your hunter of a
father can't send his hounds!

58
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:33,045
The pig!!!

59
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,571
Be ready. I'II come at 10 AM.

60
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:37,572
We'II make our getaway.

61
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:42,578
''PeopIe, Iisten!!''

62
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,581
Listen to the rascaI!

63
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:48,984
Hark the cheek!
What he writes!

64
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,588
There's no other way.

65
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:57,197
We'II Ieave this crueI worId!

66
00:05:57,604 --> 00:05:59,595
Where wiII they go? To Mysore?

67
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,600
The son of a bitch!

68
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,600
- Stupid girI!
- Further he writes..

69
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,411
We'II buiId a nest
on the tree of Iove!

70
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:08,012
WiII he Iay eggs in it?

71
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:13,552
Where your hunter father
can't send his hounds!

72
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,545
He caIIed you dogs!

73
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,288
what? CaIIed us dogs!

74
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:20,549
Yes and he says he'II come at 10!

75
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:22,551
And whisk you away!

76
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:25,021
He knows I'II go to office at 9

77
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,556
And he'II whisk her away at 10!

78
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:31,561
Doesn't he know today is Sat?
CentraI Government has a hoIiday!

79
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:34,563
It's aImost 10.
The rascaI must be on his way.

80
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,305
Stop.

81
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,049
I'm terribIy Iate.

82
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,579
Hope he doesn't Ieave.

83
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:48,914
He's Iooking at his watch.
This must be him.

84
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:52,922
where are you going?

85
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:57,586
- I'm here to meet MaganIaI.
- Changed your mind?

86
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,591
Manju is waiting for you by the cot.

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,026
- Does she Iive here?
- Listen to him!

88
00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,094
Where eIse does she Iive?

89
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:08,938
- You Iook Iike her Daddy.
- Don't I?

90
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,606
You do.

91
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:13,204
TeII you what?
She's a very shy girI.

92
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,274
She Ieft without saying a word.

93
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:18,948
She didn't give her address.
But it's God's wiII that I came.

94
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,019
I know God's wiII not you!

95
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:24,613
''Anyway, pIeased to meet you.''

96
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,617
Son of a gun! You want
to eIope with my daughter!

97
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:30,623
- And you faII at my feet!
- No...

98
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,624
You're wrong. I haven't
come to whisk her away.

99
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,434
I'II marry her in pomp.

100
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:38,126
You scoundreI! Thrash him!

101
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,368
This isn't the boy!

102
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:44,974
Now you're trying to save your skin!

103
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:48,637
Don't worry. I'II break his Iegs!

104
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,447
Break his arms!

105
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,641
Break his brushes!

106
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:56,144
- Tie her to the cot!
- Yes.

107
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:58,654
I swear by your mother
she's somebody eIse.

108
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:03,151
''If she's not her, you're
not him then where is he?''

109
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,392
I don't know. I've
just come to DeIhi.

110
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:07,997
I see. You've just come
and want to eIope with my girI!

111
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:11,669
''- You're mistaken..
- No ,the famiIy is wrong.''

112
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:14,596
- what are you saying?
- My hero is here!

113
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:18,600
why are you waving the fIag?
Serious matters are being argued.

114
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,603
''He wants to eIope with my daughter.
- No, he's wrong.''

115
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:24,606
Don't interfere.
Trust me sir...

116
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:29,611
''If I trust you, my
daughter wiII eIope everyday.''

117
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:34,354
- Maybe he's saying the truth.
- Are you?

118
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:36,618
- I swear by God.
- But who are you?

119
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,394
''Of course, you're handsome
but who are you?''

120
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:43,101
My name is Sundar. I've
come here to Iook for ajob.

121
00:08:43,636 --> 00:08:45,627
My friend MaganIaI stays in 104.

122
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,130
- If you don't beIieve me..
- Hop in.

123
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:52,133
Hurry to the station!

124
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:57,980
Go to 404 and get MaganIaI.

125
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:00,642
- Right sir.
- 104 not 404.

126
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:02,454
- Or I'II get thrashed again.
- Okay.

127
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,646
''- Move, auto...
- why are you sending him there?''

128
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:10,658
- Who the heck is that?
- None of your business.

129
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:12,593
May God protect him.

130
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,058
''If MaganIaI doesn't come,
I'II beat you bIack and bIue!''

131
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:33,616
Check the door.

132
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:37,283
- you check.
- Riaz see who is at the door.

133
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:38,955
What?

134
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,617
I'II check.

135
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:44,221
I was exercising...

136
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,066
who the heII is it?

137
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:52,298
The Sikh wants to know
if MaganIaI stays here.

138
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:56,635
We three are happy go Iucky
but there's no MaganIaI.

139
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,640
They seem to have caught a thief.

140
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,640
They're Iooking for a MaganIaI.

141
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:09,144
I'II check. There
might be some probIem.

142
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:16,084
- You?
- Your neighbour misunderstand me.

143
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:19,588
''He's my paI, Sundar.
He's come from the viIIage.''

144
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:22,194
- But you are Kartik!
- He's MaganIaI.

145
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:24,365
- Kartik!
- MaganIaI.

146
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:26,595
- TeII him you're Kartik.
- My fuII name is...

147
00:10:32,612 --> 00:10:34,603
My fuII name is MaganIaI Kartik.

148
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:38,948
Forget it. Let him go.

149
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:43,350
Is that the name of a Iover?

150
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:45,022
Sounds Iike an uncIe's name.

151
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,025
He kept the truth from us.
Didn't divuIge his reaI name.

152
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:51,222
They must aII be crooks.

153
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:52,626
No more friends.

154
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:55,127
''He's my viIIage friend.
This is Riaz, a computer engineer.''

155
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:57,626
This is his house.
and that's WiIIs.

156
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:00,629
I onIy fooI and fIirt around.

157
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:04,371
Magu is Iucky to have
found friends Iike you.

158
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,078
Forget the Magu. CaII me Kartik.

159
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,638
You're speaking Agra
Ianguage in DeIhi.

160
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,584
What's wrong? Outside
too they caIIed you Kartik.

161
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:15,577
A modern name creates
a good impression with girIs.

162
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,056
My daughter ran away!

163
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,323
But she didn't eIope with me!

164
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:26,588
She eIoped because of you. She
wouIdn't if you hadn't taIked to me!

165
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,090
Let him go.

166
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:32,594
She wouIdn't have eIoped
if you were taIking.

167
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:34,598
She wouIdn't have gone far.

168
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:37,269
She's waiting for the green signaI.

169
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:56,618
- What do you want?
- Where's the boss' office?

170
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:03,124
That way.

171
00:12:13,913 --> 00:12:15,346
May I come in?

172
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,978
I heard you have a
vacancy for an artist.

173
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:26,080
I'm a good artist.
These are my paintings.

174
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:55,610
How are you my good sir?
I was Ionging to hear you.

175
00:12:57,623 --> 00:13:00,114
We'II begin today.
It's a 4 crore project.

176
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:03,117
You just give the order.

177
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:09,362
- You can begin today.
- Today?

178
00:13:11,637 --> 00:13:13,070
I'II aIways be gratefuI to you

179
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:16,231
No need to be.
My secretary is outside.

180
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:18,373
TaIk to her.
She'II expIain everything.

181
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:22,645
I never imagined I'd find work
in such a pIace at my first attempt.

182
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,916
Work hard and you'II go higher.

183
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:35,584
What does the peacock say?

184
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:44,069
What does this mean?

185
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:48,597
It means the courtyard
in front of the house..

186
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,338
There's a peacock there.

187
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,945
''and it says, what does
the peacock say? This!''

188
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:07,115
Listen to him!
Can't figure out what he says.

189
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:08,624
''He's no more, but much more.''

190
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:12,954
''If a third man sees him,
he'II faII off and die.''

191
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:19,231
''He's saying, 501 bar soap..''

192
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:24,039
He's got an order for painting
it. He'II get Iots of money.

193
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:34,583
What's he saying?

194
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:38,079
He's so stupid.

195
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,992
''When he gets the money,
he'II go to a haII...''

196
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:45,587
Where girIs dance?

197
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:49,993
He Ioves to watch dances.
God knows what he understands..

198
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:53,595
They dance without sticks.

199
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:56,939
There's no dance without
sticks in Gujarat.

200
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,271
One who dances without
sticks is a fooI.

201
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,610
This poor chap must
be finding it so difficuIt.

202
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:05,609
''No, I'm the one who
has a tough time.''

203
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:08,610
The Iast time I took
him to the garba.

204
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:12,557
He danced so much with a girI..

205
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,551
...that he made her pregnant.

206
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:19,155
They got 3 fetus out.

207
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,559
What can he do?
He has no tongue.

208
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:25,560
I say it's good.

209
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:31,168
He'd burn incense in
front of everyone's homes

210
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,570
where do I smeII girIs?

211
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:38,072
GirIs!

212
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,428
''If he is WiIIs,
is he Four Square?''

213
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,591
Good joke! Do you smoke?

214
00:15:57,603 --> 00:15:59,264
That is Riaz.

215
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:03,006
You're wearing great cIothes.
But why are you wearing so much?

216
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,941
He'II never change.

217
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:11,273
Why are you standing there?
Come here.

218
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:16,544
He's a painter.

219
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:19,956
This is ShiIpa.

220
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,221
And that is Reshma.

221
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:50,578
My Pop! You're a stupid idiot!

222
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,581
Ran away without saying a word.

223
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:56,584
why? Why do you have to Iook for me?

224
00:16:57,997 --> 00:17:00,591
''- Are you in a bad mood?
- No, my stars are bad.''

225
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:03,595
''- But teII me what's wrong
- SimpIe, I got tea...''

226
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:05,597
And Magu didn't even
introduce me to his friends.

227
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:07,599
- Just sent me away.
- That was on purpose.

228
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,101
- Why?
- You'd be insuIted.

229
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,339
- why?
- You can't speak EngIish.

230
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:15,939
- So?
- So what...

231
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:17,605
Does nobody Iove those
that can't speak EngIish?

232
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:21,108
FIirt with one who speak Hindi.

233
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,282
How does one romance girIs?

234
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:27,023
- It's a game of time.
- Meaning?

235
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:31,357
Why according to you
do girIs wear watches?

236
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,623
''- To teII the time.
- FooI, to young men Iike us.''

237
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:39,433
Do one thing. Stand
at a bus stop tomorrow.

238
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:41,303
And ask a girI the time.

239
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,973
''If she teII it,
smiIe and thank her.''

240
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:49,375
And get into the bus she embarks.

241
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:52,644
Then push against her
and show your muscIes.

242
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:54,384
She wiII smiIe.

243
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:58,388
Then assume she's yours!

244
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:06,393
''One warning, check that
she's wearing a watch.''

245
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,260
Don't ever wear a watch
and ask a girI the time.

246
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:14,105
You'II get beaten by shoes of
every company. I've experienced it.

247
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:48,630
What are you doing?
I'II get hurt!

248
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:51,633
- did I teII you?
- RascaI!

249
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,136
Stupid! Look at him stare!

250
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:26,100
''Why, you nincompoop! ShameIess!''

251
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:30,605
BareIy 5 minutes since the
girIs came and you want the time!

252
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:34,051
Like fIies and honey!

253
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,612
Can't afford to buy a
watch and wants to fIirt!

254
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:42,219
Want to know the time?
There's a cIock tower for you!

255
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:46,621
Get Iost! I'II thrash you!

256
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:52,103
- It's impossibIe!
- I teII you...

257
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:55,630
We aIways use this formuIa.
AII the time.

258
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:58,371
And aIways hit buIIseye.

259
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:00,373
God knows where that Iady
came from and got stuck.

260
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:06,311
''It happens, these things
happen in big cities.''

261
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:08,643
- May I? - Sure.
- Say something new.

262
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,919
''AII right, I'II give you a new
formuIa because you're my paI's paI.''

263
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:15,184
As the girI comes cIose..

264
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:18,085
Look into her eyes..

265
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:21,592
''And softIy say, you are mine.''

266
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:25,069
You are mine. Mine!

267
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:28,596
- You are mine.
- Yes!

268
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:56,624
''She said, hi.''

269
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:18,587
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

270
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,583
- WiII you take off your gIares?
- Why?

271
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:23,585
I think your eyes must be beautifuI.

272
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:25,395
''Here, I've taken it off.''

273
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,329
You are mine.

274
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:31,593
You can't be mine! Never!

275
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:42,604
Why have you broken a Ieg
and come to the hospitaI?

276
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:44,279
FIirting with the nurse?

277
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:46,608
You are responsibIe for this.

278
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:49,618
''You gave me the formuIa,
Iook into the girI's eyes..''

279
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:53,023
''And say, you are mine!''

280
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,457
You are mine? Cheat!

281
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,623
You are to be bIamed.
Can't do anything right.

282
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:01,122
Then you bIame my traditionaI idea!

283
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:05,229
Don't feeI offended.

284
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:09,130
Friends give their Iives for
each other. What's a few bones?

285
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:13,078
Give me a third idea.

286
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:16,578
an idea that wiII do the
job and not break any bones.

287
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,574
''Yes, I'II think...''

288
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:23,179
I'II think and get back.

289
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:27,991
He's back!

290
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:29,592
- what happened?
- TeII you what he says?

291
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:34,261
Give me an idea that wiII do
the job and not break my bones.

292
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:41,266
''I teII you, he won't change tiII
a girI hits him with her sandaI.''

293
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:43,268
High heeIed sandaI!

294
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:46,335
Look at his face!
He Iooks Iike a cIown!

295
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:51,014
- Fourth faiI.
- Second. He's good for nothing.

296
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:55,384
He thinks good shoes and
good cIothes get you girIs.

297
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,613
He has no idea of how
smart today's girIs are.

298
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,287
''These days if a boy is
smart, he can have any girI.''

299
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:04,459
However he is...

300
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:09,624
- And he is...!
- He shouId Iook at himseIf.

301
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:12,570
The mirror wiII crack
the day he peeps into it!

302
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,576
The mirror wiII crack
the day he peeps into it!

303
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:12,221
what's the matter?
You've put on weight.

304
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:18,229
You're Iooking suave but
he's Iost aII his hair.

305
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,561
- She..
- Me..?

306
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:32,573
- For how Iong are you here?
- I'II return next week.

307
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:35,314
- Why?
- He has to print his book.

308
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,021
That's great.

309
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:41,582
We don't see PayaI.

310
00:25:04,616 --> 00:25:08,211
- Why are you Ieaving?
- PayaI wiII stay with you.

311
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,282
she's doing research on
Indian cIassicaI music.

312
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,049
Let's go home.

313
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:42,019
What's the time?

314
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,581
Good God! Now even
girIs ask the time

315
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:52,189
HaIf past...nine.

316
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:55,089
Why wear a watch when
you can't read the time?

317
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:56,598
Stupid jerk!

318
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:58,594
- ShaII I teII you?
- who asked you?

319
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:03,404
Got the drift?
GirI is interested in you.

320
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:05,876
CouIdn't I have toId the time?

321
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:08,603
My time is bad.

322
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:13,550
Look at that. New prey.

323
00:26:18,557 --> 00:26:20,218
Seeing her here for the first time.

324
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:30,899
Sound box defect
but the stuff is good.

325
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,970
- Meaning?
- She's mute.

326
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:36,564
Gesturing with her hands.

327
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:40,568
But the stuff is great.
Might be asking for your address.

328
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,405
- What's the matter?
- I'm so happy!

329
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:48,135
I'II get admission in 2 days.

330
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,639
WiII you have tea or coffee?

331
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:58,487
''TeII me, is there a schooI for
the deaf and dumb in Sundarnagar?''

332
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:01,649
Don't know but why do you ask?

333
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,652
It was bizarre. I asked a girI
the address. She was mute.

334
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:08,394
''Then ahead, a boy
expIained the address to me.''

335
00:28:09,668 --> 00:28:11,397
He too turned out to be dumb.

336
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:19,205
I was thinking about them.
Can't speak their heart out.

337
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,010
Can't hear others.

338
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:23,012
Is this any Iife?

339
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:26,607
OnIy a mute can answer this.

340
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,092
Are you Sridevi?

341
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:37,618
Madhuri's eIder sister?
Manisha's niece?

342
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,623
''If you're not reIated to them,
step on to my heart.''

343
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:47,633
What a shut up!

344
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:14,258
- Gone!
- Where?

345
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,091
I've Iost my heart.
Let's Iook at my wife.

346
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,595
Look down!

347
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:40,084
- Come home..
- We'II see you at night!

348
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:42,610
Let go her hand!

349
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:51,626
''Baba, stand here.''

350
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:55,625
''- AII right, who was she?
- who?''

351
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,364
- GirI.
- which girI?

352
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:01,369
The one with you in
the shopping center.

353
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,972
Her? Can I have a smoke?

354
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:08,306
- Sure...
- Give him a Iighter too.

355
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:11,413
Don't need the Iighter.

356
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:15,075
She's my girI friend.

357
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:16,986
What???

358
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,582
''Don't be shocked. At my age,
everyone has a girI friend.''

359
00:31:22,594 --> 00:31:24,585
- Since when is this going on?
- 3 months.

360
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:27,588
But it's onIy 3 months
since you came to DeIhi.

361
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,090
3 minutes are enough
for hearts to meet.

362
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:32,934
He's Iearnt to taIk.

363
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:39,009
What the heck. The girI you
Iove is from BiII CIinton's famiIy.

364
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:42,273
And you Iook Iike you've
escaped from Africa's jungIes.

365
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:44,104
You'II never get her.

366
00:31:44,616 --> 00:31:46,015
I've seen this girI somewhere.

367
00:31:46,218 --> 00:31:47,617
In my dreams.

368
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:52,617
The girI has such connections
that you couId never get to her.

369
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,616
InsuIting us because
he's found a girI.

370
00:31:56,127 --> 00:32:01,463
No but I get the feeIing you don't
Iike me being paIs with a pretty girI.

371
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:06,434
- Why? - Because you think
onIy you can know pretty girIs.

372
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:11,632
It happens. A new Iover and
aIcohoIic stray very easiIy.

373
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:15,239
Bye. Must sIeep earIy
in order to wake earIy.

374
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,981
I have to go jogging
with her in the morning.

375
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,075
He can't waIk and wants to jog!

376
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:25,317
- Need 2 days...
- For what?

377
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:29,253
To find out about the girI.

378
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:56,610
Give me 5 bucks or 10 or
even 50if you have no change.

379
00:32:57,122 --> 00:32:59,113
Beggars want notes not change.

380
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,219
Why is he careIessIy
weaving through cars?

381
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:05,289
They are used to it.

382
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:12,228
The signaI wiII soon turn green
somebody wiII crush him!

383
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,060
Nothing wiII happen.

384
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:19,065
How Iong wiII Ioose change feed me?

385
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:22,303
The poor souI is risking
his Iife to survive.

386
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:25,572
Can't I be free from change?

387
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:51,939
Not Iike this. What are you doing?

388
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,602
- Do you foIIow the emotions?
- No.

389
00:33:57,015 --> 00:34:00,075
Then study the mute.
They can't speak.

390
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:04,019
But their face
expresses their feeIings.

391
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:06,613
That is expression.

392
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:20,902
''- Great, man...
- Painting?''

393
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:23,564
- Finished?
- To quite an extent.

394
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:25,565
Is his horoscope ready?

395
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:30,241
- What's the deIay?
- Encore.

396
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,914
- Let's hear it.
- Yes.

397
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:36,577
Her name is PayaI.

398
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,582
What a name! I hear beIIs.

399
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:46,321
Further..her Dad teaches
history in the University.

400
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:47,997
Mother teaches Hindi in America.

401
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:53,594
And the daughter PayaI is in
India to do research in dance.

402
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:57,370
''She's Iiving with her
father's friend, AniI Choudhary.''

403
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:01,340
We hear that she's very hot tempered.

404
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:04,377
She doesn't toIerate mediocrity.

405
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:08,009
Yet you say she's your girI friend?

406
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:09,618
That's wrong!

407
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:13,955
A girI Iike her wouIdn't
empIoy you to scrub her car!

408
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,552
By the way why did you bother?

409
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:19,557
You couId've asked me
I knew aII. I'd teII you.

410
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:24,967
Don't act smart. There are
things your uncIe won't know.

411
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,062
OnIy we know because
we are the experts!

412
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:32,065
We can sniff everything.

413
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:35,239
Sniff? Were you poIice dogs?

414
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,344
Hear on. You'II forget the abuses.

415
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,574
- Go on.
- Right.

416
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:48,253
The tongue of the girI is razor sharp.

417
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:50,589
What?

418
00:35:50,929 --> 00:35:53,261
Did you hear her speak?

419
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:56,590
Yes. She has a sharp voice.

420
00:35:57,602 --> 00:35:59,365
She caIIs America from an
STD booth every evening.

421
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:01,596
Comes out to taIk?

422
00:36:02,607 --> 00:36:05,041
Something fishy. Must be a boy friend

423
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,339
- Yes!
- That's rubbish!

424
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:11,605
Ask the STD booth owner.
I've arranged it.

425
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:26,558
There she is!

426
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,364
Nervous?

427
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,004
Go and hear the rest of the story.

428
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:42,569
Every man you extend a hand of
friendship to gives you a Iove Ietter

429
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:44,573
''And says, I Iove you.''

430
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:49,382
I can onIy be friends with him.

431
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:53,082
''Beware. He too might give you
a Iove Ietter and say, I Iove you.''

432
00:36:54,592 --> 00:36:56,583
He can't say that even if he wants to.

433
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:02,593
Got a shock!

434
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,592
She must have kissed her boy friend.

435
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:10,939
I'II introduce you
when you come here.

436
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,601
Why are you caIIing from out?

437
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:16,344
Isn't their phone working?

438
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:21,084
They don't stop me.

439
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:24,611
But making internationaI
caIIs everyday..

440
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:28,615
I don't Iike it and
why spend their money

441
00:37:29,027 --> 00:37:32,019
One must Iearn from you
how to care about others.

442
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,641
What's her boy friends' name?

443
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:57,382
Her boy friend's name is...

444
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,649
- what does that mean?
- That means...

445
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:07,153
You're an ass and these two
are the burden you carry.

446
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,430
Cut out the diaIogues and be cIear.

447
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:13,603
It was PayaI's Daddy on the phone.

448
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:21,943
He wanted to know whether she'd
prefer India or US after marriage.

449
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:25,378
He's bIuffing.

450
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:30,213
Let me go. I have to
pIan my future with PayaI.

451
00:38:39,631 --> 00:38:41,622
- Meaning?
- Tension!

452
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:50,631
why are you morose as a spIit drum?

453
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:54,034
- TeII me what's wrong.
- I'm very upset.

454
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:56,637
Worries won't cIimb up here.

455
00:38:57,649 --> 00:38:59,640
''TeII me, I'II find a soIution.''

456
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:03,453
The girI I met the other day..

457
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:05,646
- Who couIdn't speak..
- Right.

458
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,321
She can speak.

459
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,322
That's good news. Why are you upset?

460
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:14,598
It's matter for doubIe concern
She thinks I'm dumb.

461
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:20,195
So speak to her once
what's the probIem?

462
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:22,095
No...

463
00:39:22,607 --> 00:39:27,101
''If Kartik, WiIIs and Riaz
find out I meet her as mute..''

464
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:29,045
They wiII give the game away.

465
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,088
''Not you, I want to taIk to him.''

466
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:40,215
She's asking for you.

467
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:52,125
Don't say a word eIse
she'II feeI you taIk too much.

468
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:09,381
''Madam, there's no need
to taIk in signs.''

469
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:12,589
Speak to him. He understands.

470
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:16,317
He can hear and dance...

471
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:19,920
The onIy probIem is
he can't speak.

472
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:21,997
Do you have a probIem with that6?

473
00:40:25,603 --> 00:40:27,594
It's so beautifuI from up here.

474
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:31,331
Don't you feeI as if
we're in another worId?

475
00:40:31,943 --> 00:40:34,275
And the oId worId is Ieft down there.

476
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:40,279
May I come over here to meet you?

477
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,087
WiII it disturb your work?

478
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:50,619
Look after one. TaIks of two!

479
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,292
''In Gujarati, be means two.''

480
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:59,626
''You have to come here to meet
him twice, morning and evening.''

481
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:25,595
Love has cast a magic speII

482
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:32,092
''My Iover makes me Iose
my senses and go berserk''

483
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:36,266
I want to do something

484
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:39,405
I couId just die

485
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:45,605
Love has cast a magic speII

486
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:52,112
''My Iover makes me Iose
my senses and go berserk''

487
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:55,615
I couId do anything

488
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:59,622
I couId just die

489
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:39,093
''Wish our hearts couId meet
just Iike our hands did''

490
00:42:40,605 --> 00:42:45,599
''May the feeIings in the heart
be expressed by the Iips''

491
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:49,608
A moonIit night..

492
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:52,606
A sIight drizzIe..

493
00:42:54,352 --> 00:42:58,618
''Any kind of weather
but we must meet''

494
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:38,589
''PeopIe of DeIhi Iisten
to my story of the heart''

495
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:45,592
''Everyone comes of age
but she takes the cake''

496
00:43:47,004 --> 00:43:49,268
It takes my breath away

497
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:52,599
FIown with the tide

498
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:58,609
''The words in my mind
and my Iips didn't match''

499
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,364
Stop here.

500
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:02,374
You studied here?

501
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:08,943
He must have been your Professor.

502
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:26,365
I'm Iate for my cIasses.

503
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,571
Don't you have a probIem
with not speaking?

504
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:42,575
Can you say everything in signs?

505
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:47,079
Suppose you Iove me

506
00:45:48,592 --> 00:45:51,083
Assume it for a whiIe.

507
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:54,428
How wiII you teII me
that you Iove me?

508
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,593
Don't feeI shy. These days girIs
hoId hands and say it from the heart.

509
00:46:11,615 --> 00:46:14,550
''Like a bIack and white fiIm
hero, you're giving me a rose!''

510
00:46:15,152 --> 00:46:16,551
Do something noveI.

511
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:22,151
Dance Iike Shahrukh Khan.

512
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:42,978
what's going on?

513
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:45,242
He's dancing Iike Shahrukh.

514
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:47,915
Shut up! Didn't you feeI
shame to do this cheap act?

515
00:46:48,586 --> 00:46:50,247
He can't speak but he's human.

516
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:53,582
Making him dance Iike a
mute beast! Is this decent?

517
00:46:56,594 --> 00:46:57,925
Sit in the car.
I'II join you.

518
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,000
''Next time you do this,
I'II compIain to teacher.''

519
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,196
We were just spending time.

520
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:11,097
- Do it with somebody eIse.
- Why are you getting angry?

521
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:13,338
You're doing the same thing with him.

522
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,951
Sundar pIease.

523
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:29,118
''- Riaz?
- What's up, painter?''

524
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:31,618
Nothing. Going painting
wiII return Iate at night.

525
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,292
I'II be under the buiIding
so you can watch out.

526
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:38,625
The girIs aren't coming.
We're going with them.

527
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:40,300
To see the Titanic.

528
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:45,973
Cranky fiIm? So the girIs weep on
your shouIder and you take advantage

529
00:47:46,644 --> 00:47:51,638
ExactIy. That's why I caIIed
get PayaI and join us.

530
00:47:53,384 --> 00:47:56,148
''If you want your head on
your shouIder, shut up.''

531
00:47:57,988 --> 00:47:59,979
''CooI it, man.
You're Iosing your shirt.''

532
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:02,649
Are you reaIIy in Iove?

533
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,650
I reaIIy Iove her.

534
00:48:05,663 --> 00:48:07,062
What.???

535
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,369
Are you Ieaving?

536
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:19,098
Who wiII answer the manager?

537
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:24,012
What's wrong with him?

538
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:31,281
What were you doing?
The dumb act?

539
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:36,025
''Me? No, that was Sundar.''

540
00:48:36,227 --> 00:48:39,628
- I'm the peon.
- Where's Sundar?

541
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,021
- He's gone with a girI.
- GirI?

542
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:44,430
How was she? Fair?

543
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:46,296
- Yes.
- Big eyes?

544
00:48:46,637 --> 00:48:48,628
She was wonderfuI.

545
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:50,631
One Iook at her and
Sundar couIdn't speak.

546
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:53,303
He started muttering.

547
00:48:56,647 --> 00:49:00,447
''Painter, caught your puIse.''

548
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:02,643
Now I must find the cure.

549
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:21,594
Can you hear..?

550
00:49:22,606 --> 00:49:24,039
WeII?

551
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:33,341
What was your age when
you Iost your voice?

552
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:39,617
You were quite smaII.

553
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,217
Suffered a sickness?

554
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:47,620
Did you suffer a shock? Or a wound?

555
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:52,966
WiII he be abIe to speak again?

556
00:49:54,638 --> 00:49:56,629
Can't say for sure.

557
00:49:58,642 --> 00:50:00,109
Come in. Let me check.

558
00:50:02,646 --> 00:50:05,046
Don't worry. He'II onIy examine you.

559
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:13,179
Come in. Sit down.

560
00:50:17,594 --> 00:50:22,088
I won't do anything.
Just peep to find your voice.

561
00:50:27,604 --> 00:50:29,094
Don't worry...

562
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:35,202
We'II take an X-ray.

563
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:37,011
The reports.

564
00:51:14,585 --> 00:51:16,576
We'II try the shock treatment.

565
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:19,249
You won't be hurt.

566
00:51:27,598 --> 00:51:28,997
It's okay.

567
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:50,280
I've never seen such a case
in 20 years of my experience.

568
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,615
Yet he can't speak.

569
00:51:57,628 --> 00:52:01,029
Do anything but
Sundar must regain his voice.

570
00:52:02,032 --> 00:52:03,624
Once I'd Iike him to utter my name.

571
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:09,970
You must heIp me.

572
00:52:12,576 --> 00:52:13,975
Let's do speech therapy.

573
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:15,577
what do you mean?

574
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:20,573
You ask him to repeat
smaII words after you.

575
00:52:22,186 --> 00:52:24,586
If the Ionging to speak
arises in his heart...

576
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:28,183
And he makes efforts
he wiII sureIy speak.

577
00:52:42,606 --> 00:52:44,039
Now say..

578
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:54,607
''- Now say, Iove...
- Love...''

579
00:52:59,122 --> 00:53:00,612
Now say...

580
00:53:03,393 --> 00:53:04,621
Say...Iife

581
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:11,897
''Now say, Iove you.''

582
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:17,972
Your eyes speak

583
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:25,571
''Your eyes speak to me
why don't you say a word?''

584
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:39,256
''My breath quickens
dance with me, my sweet''

585
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:43,589
Open your mouth a IittIe

586
00:53:46,603 --> 00:53:50,596
''Open your mouth a IittIe
form a circIe with your Iips''

587
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:55,442
''Think of a girI
and say, Iove you''

588
00:53:58,615 --> 00:54:03,075
''I thought you were cute
but you are stupid''

589
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:10,616
''We're Iosing this great
weather for nothing''

590
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:50,191
I'd heard Iove...

591
00:54:53,604 --> 00:54:56,368
I'd heard Iove is bIind

592
00:54:56,607 --> 00:54:58,598
Is it aIso mute?

593
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:05,946
He's so crueI

594
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:11,019
He's so crueI

595
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,357
He's a fIirt

596
00:55:18,895 --> 00:55:23,025
''He's running away
what a man he is''

597
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:33,001
''If you stiII won't speak,
take a Iook at this pistoI...''

598
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:40,573
''I considered you cute
but you are stupid''

599
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:59,255
There's no formaIity
I can Ieave you home.

600
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:03,259
You have to go painting?

601
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:22,278
''Riaz, stop. He's here.''

602
00:57:24,621 --> 00:57:27,419
''- Hop in.
- Romeo, get in.''

603
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:30,115
CIimb aboard.

604
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,359
- Come on.
- Sit down!

605
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:37,623
Don't make a fuss.
QuietIy get in.

606
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:52,046
What's the matter?

607
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:54,640
WiII anyone teII me
what's the matter?

608
00:58:01,258 --> 00:58:04,386
Stop this drama and
teII me what's wrong.

609
00:58:07,664 --> 00:58:09,393
''What's it, guys?''

610
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:10,997
WiII somebody enIighten me?

611
00:58:12,602 --> 00:58:15,594
You..you are worse than a beggar!

612
00:58:16,606 --> 00:58:20,098
You turned yourseIf into
a street beggar for a girI!

613
00:58:22,279 --> 00:58:24,611
I am bIind..I'm mute!

614
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:26,946
''I am a crippIe, heIp me.''

615
00:58:28,618 --> 00:58:30,609
Friendship is between equaIs.

616
00:58:31,288 --> 00:58:33,279
It's onIy when two arms
advance that they meet.

617
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:35,352
One hand isn't stretched
for the aIms of friendship!

618
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:37,616
- PIease be my friend.
- Liar!

619
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:40,391
Says he goes jogging with her!

620
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:43,625
''Forget jogging, he
can't even taIk to her!''

621
00:58:43,967 --> 00:58:45,628
That is why he's
pretending to be mute!

622
00:58:46,636 --> 00:58:48,126
We brought you here
to taIk sense to you!

623
00:58:48,638 --> 00:58:51,630
Acting dumb can get
you pity not Iove!

624
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:55,440
''That is why stop fooIing
us, the girI and yourseIf!''

625
00:58:56,046 --> 00:58:57,377
We've made our point cIear.

626
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:00,240
We'II teII her the truth.

627
00:59:02,652 --> 00:59:04,051
Just a minute.

628
00:59:06,656 --> 00:59:08,248
AII of you are my friends.

629
00:59:08,658 --> 00:59:11,923
Educated. You wish me weII.

630
00:59:13,597 --> 00:59:15,087
It wouId be impudence
answering you back.

631
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:19,364
That is why I want
to ask you one question.

632
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:25,598
Is it my fauIt that
I am not educated?

633
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:29,938
''Is it my fauIt that
I am poor, not famous.''

634
00:59:30,614 --> 00:59:33,344
Is it my fauIt that I
was born in the viIIage?

635
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:37,609
Did I ask God to make me
the son of a poor father?

636
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:40,619
Who wiII open the doors of
the raiIway Iine aII his Iife?

637
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:43,422
But never open the gates
of his son's destiny!

638
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:48,690
Do you know..?

639
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:52,033
I Ioved to study.

640
00:59:53,637 --> 00:59:57,300
I'd write with coaI
on the waIIs of my hut.

641
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,634
Because schooI was 12 miIes away.

642
01:00:02,045 --> 01:00:06,414
''As Iong as father was aIive,
he'd take me on the cycIe.''

643
01:00:10,053 --> 01:00:13,921
Later the cycIe was soId
when he was unweII.

644
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:17,992
Father passed away.

645
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:23,259
I feIt the stars and the moon
were cIoser to me than the schooI.

646
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:29,601
I'd knead cIay and
mother wouId make toys.

647
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:34,941
When my mother's tears
wouId roII in the wet cIay..

648
01:00:35,612 --> 01:00:37,603
I'd want to set the worId on fire!

649
01:00:39,382 --> 01:00:41,350
I hated to seII those toys!

650
01:00:41,618 --> 01:00:43,415
Because my mothers' tears
were mixed in them!

651
01:00:46,356 --> 01:00:50,622
ProbabIy that's the reason
my mother hid her tears.

652
01:00:52,228 --> 01:00:55,629
But man can hide the
tears in his eyes.

653
01:00:56,633 --> 01:00:58,032
Not those in the heart.

654
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:02,636
when I first painted
my mother in tears...

655
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,631
Nobody wiped her tears.

656
01:01:06,242 --> 01:01:08,642
They congratuIated her.
wished her...

657
01:01:10,647 --> 01:01:12,080
Your son is an artist!

658
01:01:16,586 --> 01:01:20,579
''After that I painted
dead parents, grandparents..''

659
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:23,422
ReIatives...

660
01:01:27,597 --> 01:01:31,590
It's easy to say man must study.

661
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:35,332
Work aII day and
study in the nights.

662
01:01:35,605 --> 01:01:37,334
But it's not reaI.

663
01:01:37,607 --> 01:01:39,097
ReaIity is...

664
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:43,409
If a spIinter pricks your naiI..

665
01:01:44,614 --> 01:01:47,014
You can't concentrate on
the sermon of any saint.

666
01:01:48,618 --> 01:01:51,018
That IittIe spIinter
keeps pricking his mind.

667
01:01:53,623 --> 01:01:55,420
That is why I stayed iIIiterate.

668
01:01:56,626 --> 01:01:57,957
I couIdn't study.

669
01:01:59,095 --> 01:02:01,962
I achieved everything a
smaII artist Iike me couId.

670
01:02:03,299 --> 01:02:03,628
I didn't get one thing.

671
01:02:05,635 --> 01:02:07,125
True Iove.

672
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,974
My friends toId me to get married.

673
01:02:12,909 --> 01:02:15,571
But I don't beIieve in the
Iove you get after marriage.

674
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:19,571
Because the wife has to Iove
the husband however he be.

675
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:22,574
That's forced not true Iove.

676
01:02:23,586 --> 01:02:26,180
And I want Iove not force.

677
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:31,586
I know PayaI doesn't Iove me.

678
01:02:32,929 --> 01:02:36,592
She onIy feeIs sorry
for a mute man.

679
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:42,594
But the man who waIks
aIone on desert sand..

680
01:02:43,606 --> 01:02:45,597
A drop of water is more
important to him that the sea.

681
01:02:48,011 --> 01:02:49,603
So I don't want to Iove that drop.

682
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:58,382
And for how Iong?

683
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:00,213
Just 3 months.

684
01:03:01,624 --> 01:03:03,421
She'II go to America in 3 months.

685
01:03:03,626 --> 01:03:05,093
PermanentIy.

686
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:12,397
I'II spend the rest of my
nights thinking about her.

687
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:18,566
That is why I beg you
not to teII her the truth.

688
01:03:24,914 --> 01:03:26,313
I had heard...

689
01:03:28,585 --> 01:03:30,052
But today I witnessed it.

690
01:03:31,588 --> 01:03:33,317
Love is crazy.

691
01:03:55,345 --> 01:03:56,607
That's Sundar there.

692
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,383
Can you speak?

693
01:04:15,298 --> 01:04:18,062
How are you?
And how is business?

694
01:04:18,568 --> 01:04:20,058
Thanks to you.

695
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:29,569
The goddess started this PCO for a
crippIe beggar to Iive with dignity.

696
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,979
Goddess mother...

697
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:35,180
I want to take a picture.

698
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:40,317
I worship Lord Shiva and Parvati.

699
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:42,057
I'II put up one picture of her..

700
01:04:44,594 --> 01:04:46,084
AII my desires...

701
01:04:47,597 --> 01:04:49,588
- Money!
- Take it.

702
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,590
You earned it.
And this is from me.

703
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:56,602
For your honesty.
Buy something for the kids.

704
01:04:58,608 --> 01:05:01,600
She's a goddess.
You can't speak.

705
01:05:02,111 --> 01:05:06,605
I can't waIk.
She heIps such peopIe.

706
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:09,608
Praise the mother.

707
01:05:11,621 --> 01:05:13,885
I'm gIad we met.
We're going on a picnic.

708
01:05:14,557 --> 01:05:15,922
WiII you join us?

709
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,959
Let's go.

710
01:05:25,568 --> 01:05:27,058
I'II buy the tickets.

711
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:30,232
I'II buy them.

712
01:05:32,575 --> 01:05:35,237
- You buy the game tickets.
- Quiet. I'm buying.

713
01:05:35,578 --> 01:05:37,569
We know you're Ioaded.

714
01:05:38,581 --> 01:05:41,573
''If my boy friend were here,
he'd buy aII the tickets.''

715
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:53,591
You came wagging your taiI
because the girIs caIIed.

716
01:05:54,597 --> 01:05:56,588
You have a torn 50 buck note!

717
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:58,332
You're not sure if
it wiII be accepted.

718
01:05:59,602 --> 01:06:02,594
FooI! On the sIy
you wear friend's cIothes.

719
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:05,096
But from where wiII you
get money in the pockets?

720
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:08,367
Stupid jerk! They are
daughters of rich parents.

721
01:06:08,611 --> 01:06:10,340
They throw money around.

722
01:06:10,947 --> 01:06:14,212
Now you'II stand behind them! Go on!

723
01:06:18,554 --> 01:06:20,545
Never eavesdrop when
two men are taIking!

724
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:30,555
You aIso got onIy a 50 buck
note. couIdn't you get more?

725
01:06:36,572 --> 01:06:39,166
Keep this and pay for everyone.

726
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:50,575
We enjoyed it.

727
01:07:08,604 --> 01:07:10,094
We're very happy there.

728
01:07:10,606 --> 01:07:13,268
But I'm strangeIy at peace here.

729
01:07:13,609 --> 01:07:15,600
I never experienced it before.

730
01:07:16,946 --> 01:07:19,210
Isn't' this what happens
when the heart and mind squabbIe?

731
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:22,379
- The mind stops thinking of the
consequences... - Give me Iiquor!

732
01:07:24,354 --> 01:07:25,616
She's not giving me money!

733
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:34,061
My wife!!

734
01:07:41,637 --> 01:07:43,036
Cheat!

735
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:07,151
Leave him!

736
01:08:09,065 --> 01:08:10,157
He's my husband.

737
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,601
He can drink and beat me
Who are you to interfere?

738
01:08:15,605 --> 01:08:17,368
I'm not beating him
because he's drunk.

739
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,430
Nor am I beating him
because he beat you!

740
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:21,935
I'm beating him because
he deceived me!

741
01:08:22,278 --> 01:08:23,609
He's a cheat!

742
01:08:25,615 --> 01:08:27,207
He Iied to me that he's a crippIe!

743
01:08:28,618 --> 01:08:30,108
Are you Iame?

744
01:08:39,028 --> 01:08:41,019
Sign here.

745
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:44,293
You must come tomorrow
when I take him to court.

746
01:08:44,967 --> 01:08:46,298
I wiII definiteIy come.

747
01:08:56,646 --> 01:08:58,136
Why do peopIe do this?

748
01:08:58,648 --> 01:09:00,639
Betray ones who trust them.

749
01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:04,643
I can excuse anything but Iies.

750
01:09:05,655 --> 01:09:09,648
I can forgive anyone but a cheat!

751
01:09:09,992 --> 01:09:11,391
Never!

752
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,087
This is what we feared.

753
01:09:40,623 --> 01:09:42,022
Goodness!

754
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:46,618
''My man, what wiII happen to you
when she finds out the truth?''

755
01:09:47,129 --> 01:09:48,619
She wiII murder him!

756
01:09:50,633 --> 01:09:53,227
''First teII us, do you
seriousIy Iove her?''

757
01:09:53,636 --> 01:09:55,399
''Or Iike us, are you wasting time?''

758
01:09:58,374 --> 01:10:01,241
I didn't know what true Iove is.

759
01:10:03,646 --> 01:10:06,114
It's after meeting PayaI
that I found what Iove is.

760
01:10:08,651 --> 01:10:10,050
She's very nice.

761
01:10:10,653 --> 01:10:12,348
''Yes, she's very nice.''

762
01:10:12,922 --> 01:10:15,322
Meaning you are in Iove with her.

763
01:10:17,026 --> 01:10:19,586
I think you shouId
teII her the truth.

764
01:10:20,096 --> 01:10:23,588
Are you nuts? She taIks
to him because he is mute.

765
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:26,593
And you want him to speak!
You'II get him sIaughtered!

766
01:10:27,103 --> 01:10:30,266
True Iove can't be
based on dishonesty.

767
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:33,598
''If she finds out from
eIsewhere, it wiII be terribIe.''

768
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,601
I think you shouId teII her.

769
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:39,604
TeII her the truth!

770
01:10:40,283 --> 01:10:43,343
She'II abuse him
and spit on his face!

771
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:46,349
Just a minute
You can't teII her the truth.

772
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:48,089
Then Iie to her.

773
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:52,287
Let's check how she
reacts in your case.

774
01:10:52,628 --> 01:10:54,619
Then we'II decide
whether to Iie or not.

775
01:11:01,637 --> 01:11:05,630
TeII me why do artists
run far from the worId

776
01:11:06,642 --> 01:11:09,634
I've been searching for you
and you're in hiding here.

777
01:11:10,646 --> 01:11:13,581
And what are you writing?
A Iove Ietter?

778
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:20,580
I Iied to you.

779
01:11:23,993 --> 01:11:25,324
Lied..?

780
01:11:26,596 --> 01:11:27,927
what did you do?

781
01:11:36,606 --> 01:11:41,600
I neither went to coIIege
nor did I win a goId medaI.

782
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:48,280
Leave me aIone for awhiIe.

783
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:23,575
''If you said the truth,
I too want to be honest.''

784
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:28,580
''Don't feeI bad, I didn't
make friends with you...''

785
01:12:28,924 --> 01:12:30,323
Because you're a good human being.

786
01:12:31,327 --> 01:12:34,319
I went out with you
because my teacher said..

787
01:12:34,597 --> 01:12:38,590
Learn to emote from
one who can't speak.

788
01:12:41,604 --> 01:12:43,333
Tears weIIing in your eyes?

789
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,602
But not in mine.

790
01:12:46,342 --> 01:12:50,278
But I was hurt to know
that Sundar Iied to me.

791
01:12:50,946 --> 01:12:52,277
My Sundar.

792
01:12:54,617 --> 01:12:56,084
I too Iied to you.

793
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:00,612
AII that I said before was a Iie.

794
01:13:02,224 --> 01:13:04,454
I didn't make friends with you
to Iearn the Ianguage of the mute.

795
01:13:05,628 --> 01:13:07,118
Not to Iearn to emote.

796
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:10,030
I made friends because you are honest

797
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:12,567
You are the same from within.

798
01:13:13,569 --> 01:13:16,299
Like hoIy water which
you can see through.

799
01:13:17,573 --> 01:13:20,303
Then ...how couId you Iie to me?

800
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:29,080
I admit you said something
wrong to make an impression.

801
01:13:31,087 --> 01:13:34,921
But how couId you keep
it from me aII these days?

802
01:13:37,593 --> 01:13:39,356
What kind of an artist are you?

803
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:43,588
Don't you know friendship
is another name for trust?

804
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:50,004
A smaII hoIe of Iie capsizes the
boat of trust that can cross seas.

805
01:13:52,274 --> 01:13:53,605
In future mind you...

806
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:57,101
We never Iie to those we Iove.

807
01:13:58,614 --> 01:14:02,345
''And if we Iie to them,
it means we don't Iove them.''

808
01:14:32,044 --> 01:14:35,036
I don't know how much of dance
PayaI has Iearnt

809
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:40,044
But I'm sure she'II become
a painter very soon

810
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,385
''Yes, she's aII praise for this...''

811
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:48,584
''Sundar. Papa, he paint so weII''

812
01:14:50,228 --> 01:14:53,720
Impressed by what?
The painter or his paintings?

813
01:14:54,566 --> 01:14:56,557
You shouId meet him

814
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:06,606
''Why do peopIe betray
the very ones who trust them?''

815
01:15:07,479 --> 01:15:14,351
''I can forgive anything but a Iie,
and a fraud I wiII never forgive''

816
01:15:28,033 --> 01:15:32,493
''Remember, never to Iie
to your Ioved ones''

817
01:15:33,138 --> 01:15:36,699
''If we Iie,
we sureIy aren't in Iove''

818
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:06,000
''There's no honesty about it,
there's no dishonesty about it''

819
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:13,769
Whatever it is...

820
01:16:14,112 --> 01:16:18,014
Iove is onIy nice

821
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:26,019
Oh Iove...

822
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:32,013
''It dweIIs in the heart,
Iike a heartbeat''

823
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:40,022
''And with a smiIe,
it makes you bear any pain''

824
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:49,370
''It's somewhat Iike this,
maybe somewhat eIse...''

825
01:17:49,841 --> 01:17:53,208
Whatever it is...

826
01:17:53,445 --> 01:17:57,347
Iove is onIy nice

827
01:18:01,987 --> 01:18:05,150
Oh Iove...

828
01:18:35,587 --> 01:18:42,425
''Two hearts meet,
then they faII in Iove''

829
01:18:44,062 --> 01:18:50,524
''Together they wiII Iive,
together they wiII die''

830
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:59,442
''A bit of it is shown,
a bit of it is hidden...''

831
01:19:00,212 --> 01:19:03,648
whatever it is...

832
01:19:03,982 --> 01:19:07,713
Iove is onIy nice

833
01:19:12,324 --> 01:19:15,589
Oh Iove...

834
01:19:46,024 --> 01:19:53,021
''Even after the fires have died down,
the smoke stiII rises''

835
01:19:54,266 --> 01:20:01,035
''Even after a Iifetime,
Iove stiII stays strong''

836
01:20:06,211 --> 01:20:09,977
''Love never grows
young or oId...''

837
01:20:10,582 --> 01:20:13,779
whatever it is...

838
01:20:14,052 --> 01:20:17,988
Iove is onIy nice

839
01:20:26,865 --> 01:20:30,323
''There's no honesty about it,
there's no dishonesty about it''

840
01:20:31,069 --> 01:20:34,664
Whatever it is...

841
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,339
Iove is onIy nice

842
01:20:43,114 --> 01:20:45,014
Oh Iove...

843
01:21:11,976 --> 01:21:14,240
Is PayaI in?
- Who is this?

844
01:21:14,979 --> 01:21:16,708
I'm...

845
01:21:17,382 --> 01:21:20,146
What do I teII PayaI?
Who is speaking?

846
01:21:20,385 --> 01:21:21,977
I'm Sundar

847
01:21:22,153 --> 01:21:27,250
Sundar... who...?
- Her friend

848
01:21:28,993 --> 01:21:34,795
So you're Sundar?
HoId on a minute

849
01:21:40,672 --> 01:21:42,469
Says it's Sundar

850
01:21:50,014 --> 01:21:51,811
PayaI speaking

851
01:21:52,016 --> 01:21:57,010
''PayaI, I'm Sundar''

852
01:21:57,288 --> 01:22:00,746
Sundar... who?
- Your friend

853
01:22:01,059 --> 01:22:04,961
''If you fancied hearing my voice,
you've had your fancy''

854
01:22:05,597 --> 01:22:07,758
''Besides, you simpIy can't be Sundar''

855
01:22:09,968 --> 01:22:12,960
''Because never wouId he crack
such a cheap joke, nor does he Iie''

856
01:22:13,972 --> 01:22:15,735
''Poor thing, he can't speak''

857
01:22:41,065 --> 01:22:44,000
You're going to Iive Iong!
We were just taIking about you

858
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:47,001
What are you staring at?
Come inside

859
01:22:50,275 --> 01:22:54,473
I'm going to introduce you to foIks
whom I Iove the most

860
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:57,504
My Mummy
and my Daddy

861
01:22:58,016 --> 01:22:59,415
Sit

862
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:06,016
Who's this?
- I know. He's Sundar

863
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:11,423
What's so great?
Even I made him out

864
01:23:12,163 --> 01:23:15,030
How come?
- From the gIitter in your eyes

865
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:24,364
''PayaI and I have discussed you so much,
I feeI as if I've known you for years''

866
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:30,036
''As you know son,
I'm a history professor''

867
01:23:36,588 --> 01:23:39,614
So never Iet the handicap
dishearten you

868
01:23:40,525 --> 01:23:42,516
Nor shouId you be embarrassed

869
01:23:46,464 --> 01:23:48,056
That reminds me

870
01:23:48,633 --> 01:23:54,071
There was a caIIer who
introduced himseIf as Sundar

871
01:23:58,476 --> 01:24:01,707
Doesn't even know that
Sundar can't even speak

872
01:24:02,447 --> 01:24:07,680
''But Vikram was saying,
he sounded just Iike Sundar''

873
01:24:09,354 --> 01:24:13,017
''I meant, that's what he'd sound
exactIy Iike, if he ever spoke''

874
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:20,023
Hi Sundar! You're here at the
right time. Have Iunch with us

875
01:24:21,032 --> 01:24:22,693
Get up son

876
01:24:26,371 --> 01:24:28,362
''Come son, sit''

877
01:24:32,043 --> 01:24:35,035
WonderfuI aroma.
- Your choicest dishes

878
01:24:40,251 --> 01:24:42,048
''For him, onIy diet''

879
01:24:51,062 --> 01:24:52,654
Start eating

880
01:24:53,131 --> 01:24:56,123
''Sundar, sit.
- Sit down, son''

881
01:24:57,335 --> 01:25:02,534
I'm here to apoIogise

882
01:25:03,441 --> 01:25:05,432
He speaks

883
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:09,006
I thought...

884
01:25:11,015 --> 01:25:12,414
I aIways suspected

885
01:25:14,018 --> 01:25:19,615
''I know it's so wrong of me to hurt
nice foIks Iike you, particuIarIy PayaI''

886
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:25,251
But I didn't do it on purpose.
It began with a misunderstanding...

887
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:29,466
and it went so far
and I was afraid I'd Iose PayaI...

888
01:25:29,601 --> 01:25:32,764
and I couIdn't teII the truth.
I kept on Iying

889
01:25:33,538 --> 01:25:36,029
''PayaI, I have wronged you''

890
01:25:39,911 --> 01:25:44,041
You turn out to be a great actor!
How cIeverIy you fooIed us

891
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:48,849
''For our sympathies,
we're Ieft dumbstruck''

892
01:25:49,287 --> 01:25:52,654
I never expected this man
wouId turn out to be so IowIy

893
01:25:53,057 --> 01:25:56,390
''PayaI, make sure you gauge a man
by his status before you get invoIved''

894
01:25:57,495 --> 01:26:00,862
And PayaI wouId never tire
of praising him

895
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:08,803
Cheat! Get out of here

896
01:26:09,073 --> 01:26:11,667
''PayaI, Iisten to me...
- Not a word from you''

897
01:26:20,818 --> 01:26:24,515
What's your probIem?
Are you washing or bathing?

898
01:26:27,592 --> 01:26:30,026
''Come on, everyone's waiting''

899
01:27:14,205 --> 01:27:15,536
Down here

900
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:22,741
Where's Sundar?
- Maybe on the other set

901
01:27:23,247 --> 01:27:25,579
WiII you teII him
to come to see me at home?

902
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,741
I'II teII him that

903
01:27:37,028 --> 01:27:39,428
Come out Sundar.
It's over

904
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,733
''My guru, Birju Maharaj
... of Kathak fame...''

905
01:28:20,071 --> 01:28:26,010
he's over sixty and he rehearses
12 hours a day. How does he manage?

906
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:32,673
''Just an hour and I start panting.
And of Iate, I've started...''

907
01:28:33,017 --> 01:28:36,009
taking Iesson in the Odissi form.
- Stop taIking and shut your eyes...

908
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:39,084
for a nice gift.
- Shut your eyes...

909
01:28:39,223 --> 01:28:41,350
and the onIy nice thing you get
is a dream

910
01:28:41,526 --> 01:28:46,554
''No, this is more beautifuI than
a dream, it's just Iike you''

911
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:49,431
Now shut your eyes and
stretch your paIm. Quick

912
01:29:21,566 --> 01:29:22,999
Exquisite

913
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:30,730
What is it...?

914
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:35,001
Been ten days since Sundar came by

915
01:29:36,247 --> 01:29:39,739
I don't even know how he is.
I must go to see him

916
01:29:41,185 --> 01:29:43,016
''PayaI, one minute...''

917
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:12,313
''What happened? An accident?
- A painter, he feII''

918
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:15,780
What a faII! Wonder whether
he's going to survive

919
01:30:15,987 --> 01:30:18,478
''And he never even muttered a word,
poor thing was a mute''

920
01:30:44,415 --> 01:30:46,679
Where's the emergency ward?
- Whom are you Iooking for?

921
01:30:47,118 --> 01:30:50,815
''A painter, he feII from a hoarding.
- Sorry, he's finished''

922
01:30:51,289 --> 01:30:53,280
Sent him to the morgue

923
01:31:14,111 --> 01:31:17,979
Why don't you answer me?
How were you reIated to the dead body?

924
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:23,983
''Let me see the body, pIease.
- Sorry, not without permission''

925
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:37,117
I'm apprehensive...

926
01:32:37,528 --> 01:32:40,554
that's what they aII say

927
01:32:40,898 --> 01:32:46,632
But Iove just happens

928
01:32:47,371 --> 01:32:50,568
Love's crazy

929
01:33:40,291 --> 01:33:45,627
CouId this magic come to an end?

930
01:33:47,064 --> 01:33:52,400
CouId I faII in Iove with you?

931
01:33:53,204 --> 01:33:59,268
''And we'II be in troubIe
if we Iose ourseIves''

932
01:34:12,923 --> 01:34:15,824
God forbid...

933
01:34:16,093 --> 01:34:23,431
''but they say,
Iove just happens''

934
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:29,037
Love's crazy

935
01:35:05,676 --> 01:35:11,012
''Let's think this over
before we decide''

936
01:35:12,049 --> 01:35:18,010
''Let's part today,
Iet's see each other another day''

937
01:35:18,622 --> 01:35:24,754
''Let's Iie awake through the night
Iet's taIk it over again tomorrow?''

938
01:35:38,275 --> 01:35:41,210
Lovers Iie awake...

939
01:35:41,478 --> 01:35:47,781
''that's why they say,
Iove just happens''

940
01:35:51,522 --> 01:35:54,514
Love's crazy

941
01:36:47,044 --> 01:36:50,707
''WonderfuI painting,
but no one's buying that''

942
01:36:51,115 --> 01:36:56,052
''In this country, peopIe don't have
the money to buy bread''

943
01:36:57,454 --> 01:36:59,854
Who'II buy your painting?
- You couId make miIIions...

944
01:37:00,124 --> 01:37:03,992
''painting ''No Vacancy'' signs.
- Didn't he swear?''

945
01:37:04,328 --> 01:37:07,991
''That he'd never ever see PayaI again.
And here he is, painting''

946
01:37:08,532 --> 01:37:12,992
''Come on, why don't you speak?
What happened to your resoIve?''

947
01:37:15,072 --> 01:37:21,011
I wanted never to see her again.
But I think God has wiIIed otherwise

948
01:37:23,013 --> 01:37:25,243
You know what she did today
when she found out...

949
01:37:25,482 --> 01:37:30,351
that a painter had faIIen to his death?
Like a woman possessed...

950
01:37:31,021 --> 01:37:33,683
''she went from hospitaI to hospitaI,
Iooking for me''

951
01:37:34,758 --> 01:37:38,353
''And when she saw that I'm aIive,
she ran up to me and...''

952
01:37:38,495 --> 01:37:41,020
she hugged me and she broke down
in front of a crowd of thousands

953
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:47,035
And her tears washed my resoIve away

954
01:37:52,576 --> 01:37:57,036
And now... I can't Iive without her

955
01:38:02,986 --> 01:38:04,783
''Madam, can you spare a cigarette?''

956
01:38:06,724 --> 01:38:08,988
Keep your EngIish to yourseIf

957
01:38:11,995 --> 01:38:13,986
Where are you off to?
- Get Iost Ioony

958
01:38:14,998 --> 01:38:18,331
''You Iook Iike a smoker.
Come on, treat me to a fag''

959
01:38:20,003 --> 01:38:21,664
Hurry up

960
01:38:24,208 --> 01:38:28,338
Smoking too much is bad for heaIth.
- Strange guy

961
01:38:45,028 --> 01:38:48,691
Why are you so ugIy?
Are you a fiIm hero?

962
01:38:50,033 --> 01:38:54,026
Look at your cIothes!
Going to a fashion show?

963
01:38:55,506 --> 01:39:01,035
Why are you staring at me?
Want to kiII me? Want to rob me?

964
01:39:01,979 --> 01:39:06,313
''You're so ugIy, I wouIdn't
Iet you marry my buffaIo''

965
01:39:06,984 --> 01:39:12,217
You got no tongue? Are you dumb?
Then teII me you're dumb

966
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:15,788
''Oh yes, I got my tongue. But you won't
be Ieft with one. What's aII this rot?''

967
01:39:16,093 --> 01:39:19,790
''Don't get worked up,
I onIy work for teIevision...''

968
01:39:20,097 --> 01:39:22,998
I'm just checking out
the toIerance IeveI in peopIe

969
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,994
Where's the camera?
- Over there

970
01:39:28,405 --> 01:39:32,000
You never saw me on tv?
- Damn! You incited me

971
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:38,007
You wouId've ended up off the screen.
- So you recognise me?

972
01:39:41,018 --> 01:39:43,009
Udham Singh...?
- Look at me

973
01:39:46,023 --> 01:39:47,615
''Yes, I've seen you''

974
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:55,031
''But you know, I can't take an insuIt.
- Watch yourseIf at Saturday. On Sony''

975
01:39:56,033 --> 01:39:57,694
''You are Udham Singh, aren't you?''

976
01:39:58,402 --> 01:40:00,029
Don't forget to watch

977
01:40:23,994 --> 01:40:25,791
''Vikram, at this hour...?''

978
01:40:30,334 --> 01:40:31,995
How come you know?

979
01:40:32,169 --> 01:40:35,002
''Make it a point to know
and you get to know, anyhow''

980
01:40:38,175 --> 01:40:40,507
''Not now, after you've cut the cake''

981
01:41:35,232 --> 01:41:39,999
''PayaI, you'II Iive to be a hundred.
- How did you know that?''

982
01:41:40,370 --> 01:41:46,240
Because my prayers are with you.
And prayers never go in vain

983
01:41:49,346 --> 01:41:55,512
''PayaI, you Iook Iost.
Anything Iacking in the party?''

984
01:41:56,219 --> 01:42:01,748
''No, I was just thinking,
had Sundar been here...''

985
01:42:03,961 --> 01:42:06,691
I tried my best to find him

986
01:42:08,398 --> 01:42:10,958
He didn't even caII you?
At Ieast he shouId've wished you

987
01:42:11,969 --> 01:42:16,702
Maybe he doesn't know it's my birthday.
- Too bad. Didn't I teII you?

988
01:42:17,074 --> 01:42:19,770
''Make it a point to know
and you get to know, anyhow''

989
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:25,972
Drop it now and eat your dinner.
We can taIk Iater

990
01:42:35,058 --> 01:42:37,526
What's the crowd?
- Let's take a Iook

991
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,993
LoveIy banner.
- This guy must be in Iove

992
01:42:57,347 --> 01:43:04,014
WonderfuI! Never saw such
a wonderfuI way of wishing someone

993
01:43:07,491 --> 01:43:09,015
Damn the wish

994
01:43:10,293 --> 01:43:13,421
ReaIIy PayaI. OnIy Sundar couId've
given you such a wonderfuI gift

995
01:43:14,031 --> 01:43:18,434
''From the heart,
here comes a wish''

996
01:43:19,436 --> 01:43:23,532
My onIy prayer...

997
01:43:24,107 --> 01:43:28,544
may you Iive forever...

998
01:43:29,046 --> 01:43:32,709
beyond the count of time

999
01:43:34,518 --> 01:43:40,047
My heart is driving me crazy

1000
01:43:41,058 --> 01:43:46,052
''This new reIationship
seems to have Iasted forever''

1001
01:43:46,763 --> 01:43:49,459
''My waking hours, I dream...''

1002
01:43:50,167 --> 01:43:52,601
I am Iost

1003
01:43:53,136 --> 01:43:55,866
And sIowIy...

1004
01:43:56,073 --> 01:43:57,404
we're Iost...

1005
01:43:57,574 --> 01:43:58,939
you and I

1006
01:43:59,209 --> 01:44:04,806
My heart is driving me crazy

1007
01:44:05,615 --> 01:44:11,019
''This new reIationship
seems to have Iasted forever''

1008
01:44:11,354 --> 01:44:14,482
''My waking hours, I dream...''

1009
01:44:15,025 --> 01:44:17,516
I am Iost

1010
01:44:18,028 --> 01:44:20,189
And sIowIy...

1011
01:44:21,031 --> 01:44:22,362
we're Iost

1012
01:44:22,532 --> 01:44:23,897
you and I

1013
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:48,248
''I don't even know what happened,
I don't even know when it happened''

1014
01:44:49,059 --> 01:44:54,554
''I don't even know where it happened,
I don't even know how it happened''

1015
01:44:58,268 --> 01:45:03,729
''You didn't know,
I didn't know''

1016
01:45:04,407 --> 01:45:10,004
''Whatever happened,
is simpIy what happens in Iove''

1017
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:13,210
''My waking hours, I dream...''

1018
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:15,814
I am Iost

1019
01:45:16,686 --> 01:45:19,484
And sIowIy...

1020
01:45:20,023 --> 01:45:21,217
we're Iost...

1021
01:45:21,358 --> 01:45:22,848
you and I

1022
01:45:23,026 --> 01:45:28,020
My heart is driving me crazy

1023
01:45:29,032 --> 01:45:34,026
''This new reIationship
seems to have Iasted forever''

1024
01:46:06,102 --> 01:46:12,007
''The worId is beautifuI,
our hearts are young''

1025
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:18,007
''BIame it on the season,
we're innocent''

1026
01:46:21,885 --> 01:46:27,721
''You're stumbIed,
I'm in a Iurch...''

1027
01:46:28,058 --> 01:46:33,018
we're ecstatic

1028
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:36,760
''My waking hours, I dream...''

1029
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,691
I am Iost

1030
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:42,770
And sIowIy...

1031
01:46:43,039 --> 01:46:44,506
we're Iost...

1032
01:46:44,641 --> 01:46:46,108
you and I

1033
01:46:46,276 --> 01:46:51,612
My heart is driving me crazy

1034
01:46:52,048 --> 01:46:57,577
''This new reIationship
seems to have Iasted forever''

1035
01:47:17,073 --> 01:47:22,534
''So every fuII moon Iight,
you're at the Taj MahaI?''

1036
01:47:35,525 --> 01:47:38,289
''I see, so it's true Iove?''

1037
01:47:43,366 --> 01:47:46,597
AII aIone? You drove aII the way
from DeIhi to Agra? At night?

1038
01:47:47,103 --> 01:47:51,369
What if something happened?
- I onIy came to say thanks to Sundar

1039
01:47:52,042 --> 01:47:56,604
''This isn't America, this is India.
GirIs don't go out at night aII aIone''

1040
01:47:57,580 --> 01:48:00,048
''And Sundar, you...''

1041
01:48:02,252 --> 01:48:05,983
''No point taIking to you.
WeII, now you've seen the Moon''

1042
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:08,983
What are you waiting for? Sunrise?

1043
01:48:11,494 --> 01:48:13,325
''Come on, Sundar''

1044
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:28,409
You draw nice

1045
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:34,007
''Take my advice, go to Mumbai.
I'II recommend you to a friend''

1046
01:48:34,818 --> 01:48:39,915
''He runs a big ad agency. Just go over,
you'II Iand yourseIf a sweII job''

1047
01:48:41,958 --> 01:48:43,687
WiII you go?

1048
01:48:54,037 --> 01:48:56,028
No one around to give the car a heave

1049
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:58,439
''No, not you''

1050
01:49:49,025 --> 01:49:50,617
WeIcome

1051
01:49:51,761 --> 01:49:54,696
OnIy if you get out of my way

1052
01:49:55,031 --> 01:49:59,764
''Way..? Yes, way to go in Iove''

1053
01:50:00,136 --> 01:50:03,503
And you're coming in the way.
- Indeed?

1054
01:50:03,773 --> 01:50:05,764
Where's Sundar?
- Taking a bath

1055
01:50:05,975 --> 01:50:07,772
Who's singing?
- Sundar

1056
01:50:08,044 --> 01:50:10,979
What...?
- I mean Riyaz. He sings weII

1057
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:19,147
''They are together? In the bathroom?
- No! You see, there are 2 bathrooms''

1058
01:50:19,456 --> 01:50:22,516
SmaII bathroom and big bathroom.
SmaII bathroom for singing

1059
01:50:22,725 --> 01:50:25,990
''Big bathroom for bathing,
so you sing and you dance''

1060
01:50:29,332 --> 01:50:30,663
Nice song

1061
01:50:31,267 --> 01:50:32,256
Sit

1062
01:50:33,336 --> 01:50:35,998
What's it?
- It's soiIed. I'II cIean up

1063
01:50:38,007 --> 01:50:39,269
Sit

1064
01:50:42,278 --> 01:50:43,609
''No, nothing speciaI''

1065
01:50:46,416 --> 01:50:48,350
The song is going to get me kiIIed

1066
01:50:52,021 --> 01:50:54,012
PayaI is here

1067
01:50:54,557 --> 01:50:57,549
PayaI is here.
- She hasn't heard me!

1068
01:50:58,128 --> 01:51:00,289
I toId her it's Riyaz.
- And I...?

1069
01:51:00,497 --> 01:51:02,226
''Bathing.
- Got me! Two of us, together?''

1070
01:51:02,499 --> 01:51:04,490
You're bathing.
He's singing

1071
01:51:05,969 --> 01:51:08,529
Riyaz's gown.
Put it on and come out

1072
01:51:13,343 --> 01:51:16,244
Beast! He's enjoying this

1073
01:51:29,192 --> 01:51:30,523
AII okay

1074
01:51:35,331 --> 01:51:39,324
''How strange of you Sundar, to waIk
out of the car without teIIing me''

1075
01:51:40,236 --> 01:51:46,004
Vikram even asked you if he shouId
wake me up. But you refused. Why?

1076
01:51:51,014 --> 01:51:53,005
You don't Iike my coming here?

1077
01:51:59,022 --> 01:52:00,011
Not tea

1078
01:52:18,374 --> 01:52:20,569
What are you doing?
That's a bottIe

1079
01:52:21,244 --> 01:52:23,576
Are you out of your mind?
Coffee! Make coffee

1080
01:52:32,989 --> 01:52:34,149
SaIt

1081
01:52:38,328 --> 01:52:39,989
Won't open up

1082
01:52:41,464 --> 01:52:43,989
You can't even open a pack?
- What's the probIem?

1083
01:52:44,267 --> 01:52:45,791
Why is she here?
- Who?

1084
01:52:46,002 --> 01:52:47,594
This one.
- How do I expIain this?

1085
01:52:47,704 --> 01:52:50,798
Has she come to know?
- Vikram ditched me and he toId her...

1086
01:52:51,007 --> 01:52:53,737
''that I got off without teIIing her.
So she's here, to Iook me up''

1087
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:55,671
Such Iove

1088
01:53:06,256 --> 01:53:08,019
What's it now?

1089
01:53:08,358 --> 01:53:10,189
What are you upto?

1090
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:14,027
''That's Riyaz's! Don't soiI it.
Oh no, hang on''

1091
01:53:18,368 --> 01:53:20,768
You'II pass. Go on

1092
01:53:21,104 --> 01:53:22,571
She's waiting

1093
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:26,201
WonderfuI actor

1094
01:53:41,491 --> 01:53:44,051
Why did you hide this from me
for so Iong?

1095
01:53:46,396 --> 01:53:50,730
''Sundar, you're too good an artiste
to be hiding your works away''

1096
01:54:01,511 --> 01:54:04,503
You shouIdn't have hidden it
from me

1097
01:54:10,086 --> 01:54:15,023
No apoIogies. I'm taking aII the
paintings away. That's your punishment

1098
01:54:29,105 --> 01:54:33,769
What are you thinking?
- About what you are thinking

1099
01:54:34,711 --> 01:54:39,045
About today's match and Sachin.
- Who's Sachin?

1100
01:54:41,417 --> 01:54:46,650
Who's Sachin! You want to make me jump?
Sachin TenduIkar!

1101
01:54:47,056 --> 01:54:51,049
Then say Sachin TenduIkar.
- Greatest batsman

1102
01:54:52,061 --> 01:54:57,863
No better batter and I'm betting
50 bucks on him. One to ten for a ton

1103
01:54:58,067 --> 01:55:00,399
''If he scores, I get 500''

1104
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:03,800
Which worId do you Iive in?
Today's the finaI match

1105
01:55:05,074 --> 01:55:11,604
India versus Sri Lanka. My probIem is
I haven't got a tv at home

1106
01:55:12,081 --> 01:55:14,549
Then come home with me.
Riyaz has a huge tv

1107
01:55:14,817 --> 01:55:17,752
''By the time we get there,
Sachin wouId've gone home''

1108
01:55:18,287 --> 01:55:23,020
Then...?
- Why not PayaI?

1109
01:55:23,493 --> 01:55:26,018
''She Iives nearby, no?
- Yes, right ahead''

1110
01:55:26,429 --> 01:55:31,765
We can watch the match at her pIace.
I Iove watching Sachin on the handIe

1111
01:55:34,837 --> 01:55:37,362
''Come on, Iet's go''

1112
01:55:37,907 --> 01:55:43,038
I'm going to watch Sachin
and you can romance her on the sIy

1113
01:55:45,481 --> 01:55:47,711
Here I come!
- CarefuI...

1114
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,399
Who is that?

1115
01:56:07,236 --> 01:56:08,999
PayaI isn't at home

1116
01:56:12,008 --> 01:56:13,999
She's riding her scooter

1117
01:56:18,014 --> 01:56:19,675
Come upstairs

1118
01:56:44,106 --> 01:56:47,041
''I know, your partner.
- Paresh ChawaI''

1119
01:56:50,046 --> 01:56:55,040
''No, we cIimb the scaffoIdings,
M.F.Hussain doesn't cIimb...''

1120
01:56:55,284 --> 01:56:57,616
does it sitting right down there.
But I got to do my cIimbing

1121
01:56:58,054 --> 01:57:02,320
''If you're here for your paintings,
I'm not parting with them''

1122
01:57:06,996 --> 01:57:08,793
On the waIIs? Okay

1123
01:57:09,165 --> 01:57:10,792
What wiII you have?

1124
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,900
Tea.
- He'II make do with tea

1125
01:57:13,002 --> 01:57:15,994
If the goodies are coming Iater
I'm wiIIing to wait

1126
01:57:17,907 --> 01:57:19,169
Sit

1127
01:57:19,442 --> 01:57:21,000
The tv is on

1128
01:57:31,587 --> 01:57:33,020
Boundary

1129
01:57:43,032 --> 01:57:45,023
''Fours, fours...''

1130
01:57:58,047 --> 01:57:59,446
Boundary

1131
01:58:04,987 --> 01:58:06,386
Sit

1132
01:58:13,496 --> 01:58:16,988
What are you doing?
- I'm making money

1133
01:58:26,008 --> 01:58:29,000
My money is gone!
Sachin is out

1134
01:58:35,017 --> 01:58:36,678
I'm through

1135
01:58:39,021 --> 01:58:41,285
SpoiIs the mood.
- Watch this

1136
01:58:45,027 --> 01:58:48,019
That's you on tv

1137
01:58:48,364 --> 01:58:52,027
Sundar! You never toId me you're
on tv. I'm caIIing in everyone

1138
01:58:54,036 --> 01:58:56,834
Shut that off! EIse she'II find out
I'm not dumb

1139
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:00,702
''Remote... no, the remote won't do.
Got to yank the wire off''

1140
01:59:01,043 --> 01:59:02,704
Hurry up everyone

1141
01:59:11,053 --> 01:59:13,214
''Yes PayaI, I'm coming''

1142
01:59:15,992 --> 01:59:17,983
''Do something,
I'm in a fix''

1143
01:59:18,394 --> 01:59:19,793
I'm dead

1144
01:59:19,996 --> 01:59:21,793
Let's take a Iook

1145
01:59:22,999 --> 01:59:24,796
''Come in, sit''

1146
01:59:25,001 --> 01:59:26,992
''Look, there's Sundar''

1147
01:59:28,037 --> 01:59:30,005
Going to a fashion show?

1148
01:59:31,741 --> 01:59:37,270
Why are you staring at me?
Want to kiII me? Want to rob me?

1149
01:59:38,247 --> 01:59:43,583
''You're so ugIy, I wouIdn't
Iet you marry my buffaIo''

1150
01:59:44,387 --> 01:59:51,384
You got no tongue? Are you dumb?
Then teII me you're dumb

1151
01:59:55,031 --> 01:59:58,432
The fuse had to go off now?
- What you can't do...

1152
01:59:58,567 --> 02:00:01,968
someone eIse wiII do for you.
Who can prevent destiny?

1153
02:00:11,981 --> 02:00:15,644
''Riyaz, you caII us from Mumbai.
- Of course''

1154
02:00:16,052 --> 02:00:20,045
Don't write Ietters. Writing repIies
take so much time. Make sure you caII

1155
02:00:20,990 --> 02:00:23,550
Riyaz I hate the thought
of you going away

1156
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:28,997
Nor do I Iike it. But I'm not going
to find such jobs time and again

1157
02:00:30,166 --> 02:00:33,158
''I say, you come aIong too.
Lots of ad agencies out there''

1158
02:00:33,335 --> 02:00:36,236
You'II Iand ajob. Coming?
- No I'm not coming

1159
02:00:37,006 --> 02:00:39,270
Why?
- Because of PayaI

1160
02:00:39,809 --> 02:00:44,576
Is she chaining you down?
- You know nothing about women

1161
02:00:45,014 --> 02:00:48,814
''You think she's in Iove with you?
Wrong, you're in Iove''

1162
02:00:49,085 --> 02:00:54,022
She onIy sympathises.
- Maybe you know aII about girIs

1163
02:00:54,590 --> 02:00:58,026
But nothing about their hearts.
Takes the heart of an artiste...

1164
02:00:58,194 --> 02:01:02,221
to fathom a woman's heart.
Had she not been in Iove...

1165
02:01:02,465 --> 02:01:04,956
she wouIdn't have gone hunting for
me aII over town so franticaIIy

1166
02:01:05,968 --> 02:01:09,028
She wouIdn't have embraced me
in pubIic. And she wouId never...

1167
02:01:09,171 --> 02:01:11,833
have driven a hundred miIes aII aIone
to reach the Taj MahaI

1168
02:01:12,308 --> 02:01:17,974
''If you're happy, I'm happy.
I hate the thought of dreaming''

1169
02:01:18,714 --> 02:01:21,774
And you are a daydreamer.
- He's an artiste

1170
02:01:22,384 --> 02:01:24,978
''Come on, tine for your fIight.
- Bye''

1171
02:01:25,988 --> 02:01:29,651
''Riyaz, wouId you mind
if I took your room?''

1172
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:35,524
''Why even bother to ask?
WonderfuI sight, no?''

1173
02:01:36,198 --> 02:01:39,497
And the breeze is IoveIy.
- Not because of that

1174
02:01:40,202 --> 02:01:43,797
Then...?
- PayaI's house. It's out there

1175
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:49,602
You're crazy

1176
02:02:01,090 --> 02:02:06,960
Take this design and put it up
on 3 sites. Right today. Hurry

1177
02:02:07,963 --> 02:02:10,523
''Who did the creative?
- The computer, why?''

1178
02:02:10,966 --> 02:02:15,630
The sites are high up. And sky bIue
wiII merge with the sky. Wrong

1179
02:02:15,971 --> 02:02:18,371
I never knew you know more
than the computer

1180
02:02:20,976 --> 02:02:23,638
A painter who cIimbs scaffoIdings
is about to teII me...

1181
02:02:23,779 --> 02:02:26,976
how to use coIour combinations?
I run this show

1182
02:02:27,516 --> 02:02:31,316
''The computer is meant to assist men,
not vice versa. Ask anyone, sir''

1183
02:02:31,654 --> 02:02:36,057
It's wrong.
- Wrong? Are you trying to teII me...

1184
02:02:36,192 --> 02:02:39,127
what's right and what's wrong?
I run this show

1185
02:02:39,695 --> 02:02:42,721
I trained for a decade
on graphics in Germany

1186
02:02:43,065 --> 02:02:45,795
Are you trying to teach me
coIour combinations?

1187
02:02:46,335 --> 02:02:48,997
Do you even know how to sign
your name?

1188
02:02:52,775 --> 02:02:55,005
Comes teIIing me
what coIour combination is

1189
02:03:09,491 --> 02:03:14,690
''Sundar, come with me. This is going
to be the greatest day in your Iife''

1190
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:16,258
Come

1191
02:03:57,873 --> 02:04:04,005
''Friends, an artiste is nothing more
than an easeI on which...''

1192
02:04:06,015 --> 02:04:09,416
circumstance Ieaves the mark
of experiences...

1193
02:04:10,019 --> 02:04:16,515
''of sorrow, of Iove, of Iove,
hatred, creation and nature''

1194
02:04:18,594 --> 02:04:23,759
I hear Sundar cannot speak.
But who says he needs speech?

1195
02:04:25,034 --> 02:04:27,025
His fingers
do the taIking for him

1196
02:04:28,037 --> 02:04:29,766
Every stroke speaks

1197
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:33,031
Every work speaks

1198
02:04:33,442 --> 02:04:40,575
I am so gIad that PayaI Khurana
has organised this exhibition

1199
02:04:41,583 --> 02:04:45,576
I'm gIad to have been given
the chance of inaugurating...

1200
02:04:46,055 --> 02:04:49,718
the exhibition of a painter
of such caIibre

1201
02:04:50,459 --> 02:04:53,451
A great artiste of tomorrow

1202
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:06,996
Mr Painter

1203
02:06:08,003 --> 02:06:10,995
Riyaz! When did you arrive?
- Hey! Riyaz is here

1204
02:06:18,814 --> 02:06:23,547
CouIdn't stay away. You came running?
- Read about the award in the papers

1205
02:06:23,719 --> 02:06:27,621
And I took a fIight and here I am.
- So Iet's do it

1206
02:06:27,823 --> 02:06:29,017
Not today.
- Why not?

1207
02:06:29,158 --> 02:06:30,682
Today's a dry day

1208
02:06:31,026 --> 02:06:34,427
Let's just go over to Agra

1209
02:06:35,030 --> 02:06:38,864
''Oh for the sight of the Taj bathed in
the moonIight, the banks of the Yamuna''

1210
02:06:39,034 --> 02:06:42,629
Drunken ecstasy.
- You'II get drunk on water

1211
02:06:42,771 --> 02:06:44,762
Why?
- It's a dry day in Agra too

1212
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:48,239
I come aII the way from Mumbai and you
can't even stand me a bottIe of booze?

1213
02:06:48,444 --> 02:06:52,039
What can we do? Today's a dry day.
- We're heIpIess

1214
02:06:52,714 --> 02:06:54,705
That's when you can use a friend.
- Which friend?

1215
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:56,847
OId friend.
- Then we're partying?

1216
02:06:57,052 --> 02:06:59,043
FoIIow me

1217
02:07:05,727 --> 02:07:06,659
BehoId

1218
02:07:14,169 --> 02:07:17,502
''He might be nothing, but he stiII
stores in his heart...''

1219
02:07:17,739 --> 02:07:20,173
a few drops of Iove.
For us

1220
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:24,740
May the OId Monk bIess you

1221
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:29,273
He has cast off his BIack LabeI

1222
02:07:29,485 --> 02:07:35,014
''No, he took on the RoyaI ChaIIenge
and he won the award''

1223
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:43,422
You're a Kingfisher.
- Sundar is a GoIden EagIe

1224
02:07:44,032 --> 02:07:49,834
He swooped down on his award.
- No NapoIeon! NapoIeon of art

1225
02:07:50,139 --> 02:07:57,773
''Right, no more BIack Knights for you.
- RoyaI SaIute to you''

1226
02:08:01,316 --> 02:08:03,978
''Sundar, make yourseIf a gIass.
- No you go ahead''

1227
02:08:04,386 --> 02:08:06,547
Why are you so morose?
- I'm not morose

1228
02:08:06,788 --> 02:08:10,986
''TeII us, teII your friends.
- Nothing of the sort''

1229
02:08:12,094 --> 02:08:14,790
I was putting together
a few memories

1230
02:08:16,365 --> 02:08:22,998
''How I'd die to hear a word of praise,
to be caIIed an artiste. And today...''

1231
02:08:25,007 --> 02:08:29,000
''my photo is in the papers,
my name is on every Iip...''

1232
02:08:29,378 --> 02:08:32,745
aII because PayaI scrubbed
the dirt off a rock...

1233
02:08:32,881 --> 02:08:35,349
''and the worId said,
Iook, here's a diamond''

1234
02:08:36,552 --> 02:08:39,612
''Right, you're a reaI hero''

1235
02:08:41,256 --> 02:08:45,022
No Riyaz. I'm no hero

1236
02:08:46,695 --> 02:08:52,600
Look at what I have done in return
for what PayaI has done for me

1237
02:08:53,769 --> 02:08:58,832
''I didn't even say a thank you, just
for the fear of spiIIing the beans''

1238
02:08:59,107 --> 02:09:00,438
Shame

1239
02:09:02,978 --> 02:09:07,642
No one can be as IowIy as the man
who cannot repay a good turn

1240
02:09:09,985 --> 02:09:11,782
But what can you do?

1241
02:09:14,990 --> 02:09:16,981
I can teII the truth

1242
02:09:26,134 --> 02:09:31,367
Sundar...? Have you though
this over?

1243
02:09:32,007 --> 02:09:34,999
''Yes, I've given it a good thought''

1244
02:09:36,011 --> 02:09:42,575
''Despite the fact that...
- Yes, despite the fact that he's dumb''

1245
02:09:45,454 --> 02:09:50,016
I know you are a very practicaI girI.
But some things must be expressed

1246
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:55,760
Even when we traveI and we taIk to our
feIIow traveIIers. Do you know why?

1247
02:09:57,266 --> 02:10:01,965
''Because taIking, sharing,
makes ajourney easier''

1248
02:10:03,138 --> 02:10:08,633
How wiII you spend a whoIe Iifetime
with someone who cannot speak?

1249
02:10:09,511 --> 02:10:13,971
Love need not be expressed in words.
Love is heartfeIt

1250
02:10:14,483 --> 02:10:17,646
Love is one heart
going out to another

1251
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:21,778
''But before taking such a big decision,
you must make out whether...''

1252
02:10:22,124 --> 02:10:25,992
what you feeI is reaIIy Iove

1253
02:10:26,995 --> 02:10:29,520
If it was mere empathy and kindness...

1254
02:10:29,931 --> 02:10:33,992
I wouId've just done what I did.
I'd onIy heIp him

1255
02:10:34,469 --> 02:10:37,802
And then I wouId've forgotten
that I ever met one Sundar

1256
02:10:39,007 --> 02:10:42,499
But it isn't Iike that.
Not for a moment can I forget him

1257
02:10:43,578 --> 02:10:48,015
I am sure that my daughter wiII never
take the wrong step

1258
02:10:50,085 --> 02:10:54,522
''You know, Sundar Iied to me once.
A harmIess IittIe Iie...''

1259
02:10:55,090 --> 02:10:58,753
that he goes to Art CoIIege.
I had accepted it

1260
02:10:59,361 --> 02:11:04,697
''But Sundar couIdn't, he toId me
the truth and he apoIogised''

1261
02:11:05,534 --> 02:11:08,298
This honesty is priceIess

1262
02:11:16,445 --> 02:11:21,246
''Had I spoken the truth,
my story wouId've been different''

1263
02:11:23,118 --> 02:11:28,385
''But I never had the guts to teII
the truth, and how couId I?''

1264
02:11:29,991 --> 02:11:32,323
How couId I teII you that
I don't even Iike you?

1265
02:11:33,095 --> 02:11:36,223
How couId I say that my affections
were a mere put-on?

1266
02:11:37,799 --> 02:11:40,996
The onIy thing I was ever in Iove with
was America

1267
02:11:45,006 --> 02:11:50,000
Have you toId Sundar?
- Not yet

1268
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:56,679
Are you sure he wiII accept?
- I am confident of my Sundar...

1269
02:11:57,018 --> 02:12:00,476
even more confident than of myseIf.
- When are you teIIing him?

1270
02:12:02,958 --> 02:12:04,755
On the night of
the next fuII-moon

1271
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:08,953
Before the greatest memoriaI of Iove
another Iove story wiII be toId

1272
02:12:12,968 --> 02:12:17,496
''PayaI, you have decided?
- And I have announced it''

1273
02:12:18,006 --> 02:12:20,634
What...?
- I'm marrying Sundar

1274
02:12:20,976 --> 02:12:22,705
What was that?

1275
02:12:26,314 --> 02:12:31,581
Look at the gIow on her face!
I wish the dance tutor was here

1276
02:12:32,053 --> 02:12:36,717
''Not a shade of shame,
my American friend''

1277
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:40,985
''Look at your face, agIow''

1278
02:12:48,003 --> 02:12:51,495
''PayaI, the mute guy who goes
around with you is on tv''

1279
02:12:52,274 --> 02:12:54,265
They're teIecasting it again

1280
02:12:56,411 --> 02:13:00,245
Look at your cIothes!
Going to a fashion show?

1281
02:13:02,017 --> 02:13:07,421
Why are you staring at me?
Want to kiII me? Want to rob me?

1282
02:13:09,491 --> 02:13:13,689
''You're so ugIy, I wouIdn't
Iet you marry my buffaIo''

1283
02:13:14,029 --> 02:13:16,691
Are you dumb?
Then teII me you're dumb

1284
02:13:17,232 --> 02:13:20,690
''Oh yes, I got my tongue. But you won't
be Ieft with one. What's aII this rot?''

1285
02:13:20,969 --> 02:13:24,427
''Don't get worked up,
I onIy work for teIevision''

1286
02:13:26,842 --> 02:13:29,037
You wouId've ended up off the screen

1287
02:13:30,312 --> 02:13:32,212
''Yes, I've seen you''

1288
02:13:32,814 --> 02:13:34,805
''But you know, I can't take an insuIt''

1289
02:13:40,055 --> 02:13:43,388
Watch yourseIf on Sony at Saturday.
Don't forget to watch

1290
02:13:51,066 --> 02:13:55,560
Hi PayaI! I was about to caII you.
- Sundar speaks? Yes or no?

1291
02:13:57,072 --> 02:14:01,065
''No, how can that be...?
- I just watched him on tv''

1292
02:14:01,343 --> 02:14:03,004
On tv...?

1293
02:14:07,015 --> 02:14:08,744
Yes or no?

1294
02:14:10,752 --> 02:14:13,414
Answer me? Can he speak?

1295
02:14:14,022 --> 02:14:19,619
He can. He tried to hide it
because...

1296
02:14:19,828 --> 02:14:22,023
I don't want any excuses for you

1297
02:14:22,531 --> 02:14:27,025
Just teII me where I can find him.
- He went missing...

1298
02:14:27,168 --> 02:14:29,636
the day after the exhibition.
He Ieft saying that he was going...

1299
02:14:29,838 --> 02:14:33,774
to make a cIean breast to you.
But we have no idea where he's gone

1300
02:14:34,609 --> 02:14:37,442
That's why I was caIIing you.
I even teIephoned Riyaz

1301
02:14:41,049 --> 02:14:43,040
I know where he is

1302
02:14:44,052 --> 02:14:45,451
There

1303
02:15:06,408 --> 02:15:09,002
I was under
the impression that...

1304
02:15:09,344 --> 02:15:12,609
you're capabIe of understanding
someone's feeIings. How wrong I was

1305
02:15:13,615 --> 02:15:17,608
''If you couId understand peopIe,
you wouId sureIy have understood me''

1306
02:15:18,820 --> 02:15:21,015
If you were capabIe
of understanding feeIings...

1307
02:15:21,489 --> 02:15:25,482
you wouId sureIy have understood what
my eyes have toId you a thousand times

1308
02:15:26,561 --> 02:15:31,362
''If you appreciated sentiments,
you wouId never have ridicuIed mine''

1309
02:15:36,338 --> 02:15:41,435
''You aren't dumb, you can speak.
Yet you stayed mum. Why?''

1310
02:15:42,277 --> 02:15:44,768
Because you wanted my sympathy

1311
02:15:47,482 --> 02:15:51,851
''You won my sympathy,
you won my heart, you won me over''

1312
02:15:52,721 --> 02:15:54,416
And yet you stayed mum?

1313
02:15:56,524 --> 02:16:01,325
Because you buiIt this monument
to your Iove on the basis of a Iie

1314
02:16:01,997 --> 02:16:03,862
And I despise Iies

1315
02:16:10,472 --> 02:16:14,272
What you missed out what this.
I was in Iove with you

1316
02:16:15,343 --> 02:16:20,610
''And Iove is magnanimous,
Iove forgives everything...''

1317
02:16:21,082 --> 02:16:25,883
even the gravest wrongs.
CouId I not have forgiven you...

1318
02:16:26,021 --> 02:16:29,013
this one transgression?
And it was done for true Iove

1319
02:16:31,359 --> 02:16:33,520
In the fIames of your own creation
you have been consumed...

1320
02:16:33,728 --> 02:16:40,031
''you have tormented yourseIf,
you stifIed your voice aII these days?''

1321
02:16:40,435 --> 02:16:42,426
Do you reaIise how smaII
you make me feeI?

1322
02:16:45,707 --> 02:16:51,441
You don't know how many doctors
I have seen...

1323
02:16:51,713 --> 02:16:55,046
how much I have prayed that
you be given your voice...

1324
02:16:55,450 --> 02:16:59,386
that I may hear you speak my name
for once

1325
02:17:04,192 --> 02:17:06,990
''For once, just say it once''

1326
02:17:07,529 --> 02:17:10,657
The onIy words a girI wants to hear

1327
02:17:14,335 --> 02:17:16,326
''Say it Sundar, pIease''

1328
02:17:22,343 --> 02:17:25,244
''Say it Sundar, for my sake''

1329
02:17:26,715 --> 02:17:32,017
''I'm dying to hear you.
Speak Sundar, pIease''

1330
02:17:35,924 --> 02:17:39,018
''Now cut out the act.
Done, you're a great actor''

1331
02:17:39,461 --> 02:17:40,792
Now taIk

1332
02:17:40,962 --> 02:17:43,692
Why don't you taIk?
Say something

1333
02:17:45,033 --> 02:17:50,437
''If she hasn't taken it so badIy,
why are you taking it so badIy?''

1334
02:17:51,773 --> 02:17:54,037
''Come on, say it''

1335
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:07,984
I am here to teII you that
Sundar isn't putting in an act

1336
02:18:09,591 --> 02:18:11,456
He cannot speak

1337
02:18:17,165 --> 02:18:22,296
Sundar isn't putting in an act.
Last week he came to me

1338
02:18:25,373 --> 02:18:30,743
Are you crazy? The whoIe worId wants
to taIk and you want to go dumb?

1339
02:18:31,079 --> 02:18:34,173
I don't want my voice!
It's my bitterest foe in Iove

1340
02:18:34,549 --> 02:18:36,744
My voice is a disease!
What kind of a doctor are you?

1341
02:18:37,018 --> 02:18:41,387
You cannot cure my disease?
- I wiII not denigrate my profession

1342
02:18:41,589 --> 02:18:43,580
Nothing can be worse than
a wounded heart

1343
02:18:43,758 --> 02:18:47,626
I'm not going to Iive with this!
I have Iied to the girI I Iove

1344
02:18:47,929 --> 02:18:50,625
I'm not going to Iive
with this Iie

1345
02:19:15,323 --> 02:19:17,314
There is a way out

1346
02:19:18,326 --> 02:19:23,662
''Bring PayaI here,
Iike you came before''

1347
02:19:25,366 --> 02:19:30,303
''I'II treat you, I'II put you
through tests''

1348
02:19:33,308 --> 02:19:37,267
I'II put you through speech therapy
and after a whiIe...

1349
02:19:37,412 --> 02:19:40,006
I wiII decIare that you have
regained your speech

1350
02:19:43,017 --> 02:19:45,008
You want me to deceive her again?

1351
02:19:48,022 --> 02:19:52,584
You want me to Iie to the girI who's
wiIIing to spend a Iifetime with a mute?

1352
02:19:54,028 --> 02:19:55,427
Never

1353
02:19:59,367 --> 02:20:04,964
''In whatever form, a Iie is a Iie.
If she comes to know the truth...''

1354
02:20:05,173 --> 02:20:11,772
''if she deserts you,
then this sacrifice wiII be in vain''

1355
02:20:15,984 --> 02:20:18,544
I am not sacrificing my voice
for the sake of getting PayaI

1356
02:20:19,754 --> 02:20:25,989
I'm doing this because I have aIways
repaid PayaI's trust with treachery

1357
02:20:29,230 --> 02:20:31,790
This can be my onIy atonement

1358
02:20:34,736 --> 02:20:38,263
''Sundar, try to understand''

1359
02:20:40,074 --> 02:20:43,009
We make the deaf hear

1360
02:20:44,279 --> 02:20:51,014
''We can give back eyesight, we can
force stopped hearts to work again''

1361
02:20:52,487 --> 02:20:55,479
But we can never bring back a voice

1362
02:20:57,025 --> 02:21:00,756
This is where science accepts defeat

1363
02:21:02,764 --> 02:21:07,963
There's stiII time. Think it over.
Do you want Iove?

1364
02:21:09,237 --> 02:21:13,503
Or the most essentiaI thing in Iife?
Voice

1365
02:21:15,710 --> 02:21:17,701
I don't want my voice

1366
02:21:19,981 --> 02:21:22,449
''Very weII, I shaII operate''

1367
02:21:29,991 --> 02:21:33,859
''Lovers have died,
kiIIed themseIves...''

1368
02:21:33,995 --> 02:21:38,432
for the sake of their Iove

1369
02:21:45,006 --> 02:21:48,999
They onIy suffer momentariIy

1370
02:21:56,351 --> 02:22:02,551
For the first time in my Iife
I see a man resoIute enough...

1371
02:22:02,957 --> 02:22:08,759
to bear this trauma
aII his Iife...

1372
02:22:08,963 --> 02:22:10,954
with a smiIe

1373
02:22:15,503 --> 02:22:18,233
On the night of
the next fuII-moon...

1374
02:22:18,539 --> 02:22:21,531
when your Iady Iove comes professing
her Iove for you...

1375
02:22:22,076 --> 02:22:24,306
you wiII have become
worthy of her

1376
02:22:26,381 --> 02:22:28,372
I shaII operate

1377
02:22:42,463 --> 02:22:45,796
You wiII be operated at 8:30.
You are not to eat or drink

1378
02:22:48,536 --> 02:22:50,003
May I have a gIass of water?

1379
02:23:18,366 --> 02:23:21,267
The doctor wants you to change
into this for he operation

1380
02:23:23,771 --> 02:23:26,035
Right now?

1381
02:23:31,712 --> 02:23:34,044
I wouId Iike to be Ieft aIone
for 5 minutes

1382
02:23:45,526 --> 02:23:47,517
''Never again, this voice''

1383
02:24:35,376 --> 02:24:37,037
What happened?

1384
02:24:39,380 --> 02:24:41,041
''Nothing, excuse me''

1385
02:24:42,483 --> 02:24:45,850
What are you Iooking for?
- The doctor is asking...

1386
02:24:46,053 --> 02:24:48,453
for the teIephone number of one PayaI.
The doctor wants to caII her right now

1387
02:25:13,014 --> 02:25:15,676
Fraud! You're about
to caII PayaI here?

1388
02:25:16,017 --> 02:25:19,817
To make ajoke out of me?
- I am a doctor

1389
02:25:20,021 --> 02:25:25,755
I cannot betray my profession.
- Neither can I betray my Iove
