1
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,033
'My name is Tamilselvan'

2
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:24,325
'B.A History'

3
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:25,325
'Flunked'

4
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:28,992
'With my bad grades, I knew
I won't get a bank manager's post'

5
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:30,742
'But I had just
1 wish on my list'

6
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:32,492
'Don't we marry
the girl we love?'

7
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:34,700
'Similarly my wish is to
not get any damn job'

8
00:04:34,742 --> 00:04:36,742
'But do what I really love'

9
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:41,533
'I don't belong to Chennai
My home town is Thanjavur'

10
00:04:41,617 --> 00:04:43,450
'I came here to
work for a living'

11
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,783
'My parents are no more'

12
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,242
'My sister and brother-in-law
are my whole world'

13
00:04:47,325 --> 00:04:49,825
'I was born, brought up
and educated here'

14
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:52,158
'This was my 1st job in Thanjavur'

15
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:55,492
'No one can ask me if I was
not a rip roaring success'

16
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:56,700
'I ripped a lot to pieces!'

17
00:04:56,742 --> 00:04:59,117
'I wanted to do
the work of 10 people'

18
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:01,908
'But this work was handled
by the 10 fingers of my hands'

19
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,075
'It's a cake walk
even if you're blind'

20
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:05,742
'Or no electricity'

21
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:07,700
'To make envelopes'

22
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,867
'Quit your job in Thanjavur'

23
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:12,325
'Get a job worthy of
your caliber in Chennai'

24
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:13,450
'So said my bro-in-law'

25
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:14,992
'A.C.Sakthivel'

26
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:26,242
'Looking at his build up
or his groaning push-ups...'

27
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,408
'...if you think he is Suriya,
hero of 'Kaaka Kaaka'

28
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:30,742
'...or 'Kamal Hassan' of
'Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu' fame'

29
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:32,742
'...I'm not responsible
for your misconception'

30
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:36,575
'Because A.C.Sakthivel is
an Air Condition mechanic'

31
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,867
There are various types of ACs

32
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:43,825
Window AC is like a wife

33
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:46,825
However noisy
won't be heard outside

34
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,825
Will stick within
the 4 walls of the house

35
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:51,033
Split AC is like a man

36
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:54,492
All the noise is
strictly outside the house

37
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:57,742
Once inside
silent and cool

38
00:05:57,908 --> 00:05:59,992
Car AC is similar to a mistress

39
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:03,408
Can be switched on and off
as and when the need arises

40
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:07,242
And when you don't need it
just scoot and go about your job

41
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,950
Will take time to cool
It's summer, right?

42
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:11,492
Did you call me, uncle?

43
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:16,325
Hereafter don't worry about
not having a degree certificate

44
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,658
Be it a chartered accountant
doctor, or engineer

45
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:22,158
Their original certificates
will be in your hands

46
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,700
'A man can work like a machine'

47
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:33,700
'No harm at all'

48
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:38,575
'Nothing can be more torturous
than watching a machine work'

49
00:06:38,617 --> 00:06:40,867
'Actually I can't complain
too much about this'

50
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:46,742
'If I start stamping
in the morning...'

51
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:49,742
'...I have to go on with this
stamping spree till nightfall'

52
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,533
You're stamping it cross-wise

53
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,408
You stamp right
you get paid, right?

54
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:56,950
'His sarcasm
is the final stamp!'

55
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:01,617
'My bro-in-law is hell bent
on finding me a good job'

56
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:04,450
'But nothing good has
turned up till date'

57
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:06,742
'Life does not have a set pattern'

58
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:08,867
'Sometimes the right time
in a man's life...'

59
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,992
'...can set the pace for
an elevated lifestyle'

60
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:12,242
'Just wait and watch'

61
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:14,117
'This U-turn will zoom
in my life too'

62
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:16,033
'I will also be on a roll then'

63
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:17,950
'Everything depends
on the right time'

64
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:23,075
(overlapping voices)

65
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:26,242
India is surrounded
by seas on 3 sides

66
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:29,533
But there is corruption
on all 4 sides

67
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:34,242
Corruption is stifling
Mother India's breath

68
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,367
You are selling votes

69
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:37,950
And politicians
are selling our land

70
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,492
Mr Sathyamurthy is on TV

71
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:40,908
You can grind
your 'chutney' later

72
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:43,325
Will Sathyamurthy's speech
feed you when you're hungry?

73
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:46,617
Will you watch quietly gawking
while your house is being sold?

74
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:49,575
Only a skilled doctor
can save his patients

75
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:52,658
A clever lawyer
can protect justice

76
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:57,867
Similarly only a good politician
can safeguard this country

77
00:07:57,992 --> 00:08:00,950
One man like you is enough to
put India on the world map

78
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,408
But you're refraining
from stepping into politics

79
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,992
He said in his last meeting...

80
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:13,575
...he is available anytime
to sort out any issue

81
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:16,117
But our politicians put
a full stop after elections

82
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:18,158
They vanish into thin air

83
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:24,367
'Though people support Mr Sathyamurthy in
his anti-corruption campaign with vigor...'

84
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:30,158
'...we have to wait and see if this
fructifies a change for the better'

85
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:36,033
If the Wright brothers had
thought wrong like you...

86
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:38,867
...they would have let smoke
into the sky instead of aeroplanes

87
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,117
Why think that far?

88
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:41,492
Take my case for instance

89
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:45,075
I first set foot
in Chennai in 1993

90
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:49,533
Uncle, jobless, you rattle away
instead of focusing on my job

91
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:51,033
You won't listen to me now

92
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:53,033
But one day you will
read my autobiography

93
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,533
You will wait your turn
in a queue to buy and read it

94
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:57,158
By the way
where is Nasa?

95
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:17,533
Catch her

96
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,325
How dare you complain
about my boss to the media?

97
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:21,450
Catch her

98
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,908
Help me, sir

99
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:32,825
Who is he?
Which group?

100
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:34,325
How does he know
our hideout?

101
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,742
Go outside

102
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,242
Hey! Who are you?

103
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:40,242
What's your name?

104
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:41,992
I am not used to
telling my name

105
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:43,700
I am only used to asking

106
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:46,242
Which one of you is Venu?

107
00:09:46,575 --> 00:09:47,658
You...?

108
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,158
Is it you?

109
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,033
I am Venu

110
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:58,242
You have the guts
to call me by name?

111
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,575
Isn't that why
we all have a name?

112
00:10:00,658 --> 00:10:01,825
How did you land up here?

113
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,158
When it is a matter of duty...

114
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:06,283
...wherever you are, be it
any alley, gulley, nook or corner

115
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,908
...I'll track you
and stand face to face

116
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:11,283
And deliver what is required

117
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:35,075
'When it is a matter of duty...'

118
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:38,033
'...wherever you are, be it
any alley, gulley, nook or corner'

119
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:40,575
'...I'll track you
and stand face to face'

120
00:10:40,658 --> 00:10:42,908
'And deliver what is required'

121
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:46,117
Courier, huh?

122
00:10:46,158 --> 00:10:47,742
Do I look like a mason?

123
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:49,283
Sign and take it

124
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:50,825
I don't know to read or write

125
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:52,117
Thumb impression case, huh?

126
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:54,950
Why don't you sell all that gold
on your body and get educated?

127
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:55,742
See you

128
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:56,700
Bye, rowdies

129
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:04,992
Nasa, if you can use your gray cells
for such a small incident...

130
00:11:05,117 --> 00:11:07,700
...if you got a job in
the real NASA in America-

131
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,450
I've poured an extra peg for you

132
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:13,742
We are discussing here like
members of the parliament

133
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:15,617
Why are you sitting
with that pathetic look?

134
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,117
Your job went for
a toss again, huh?

135
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:18,075
What can I do?

136
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:19,783
I'm unable to find
a soul satisfying job

137
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:21,950
If everyone insists on
finding a soul satisfying job

138
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:23,950
...or marry a girl to
the dictates of their heart

139
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,117
...half the people in this
world would be jobless

140
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:27,867
And the other half
will be bachelors

141
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,158
So you must learn to like
what you get and move on

142
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:31,450
Advice, huh?

143
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:32,408
Philosopee!

144
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,325
Whether pee or crap
let it out fast

145
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:36,367
When booze is over
he'll make the 'great escape'

146
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,492
Take me for instance

147
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,742
Are you fried seer fish
to be taken into my tummy?

148
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:40,950
Come to the point

149
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,242
The very 1st time
I stepped down in Egmore-

150
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:45,783
You stepped on
cow dung, huh?

151
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:47,533
He pisses me off

152
00:11:47,617 --> 00:11:48,908
Okay, continue

153
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:52,242
The very first time
I stepped down in Egmore

154
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:57,117
The age you drink beer
and chew bubble gum

155
00:11:57,158 --> 00:11:57,825
Go on

156
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:00,992
I had no idea
where to go

157
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:03,075
You crapped
in your pants?

158
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,533
Allow me to finish

159
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:08,033
You revel in interrupting
the other man's flow of thoughts

160
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:11,992
I only knew this was Chennai
But didn't know a single soul here

161
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:15,700
But today I know this place
inside out like my palm-

162
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:18,825
You delivered Ram Durai's car
in K.K Nagar instead of T.Nagar

163
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:22,658
And vice versa
Kumar's car in T.Nagar

164
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,075
And you claim to know
Madras for 30 years!

165
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:26,783
How could you
goof up like this?

166
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,700
Go and exchange
the cars tomorrow

167
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:29,950
He and his cronies!

168
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:31,867
You said there was
something in your palm

169
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,825
Check if that's Chennai
or an itch in your palm

170
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:35,242
Your tongue runs a marathon!

171
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:36,117
Leave it

172
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,617
Even the real
Assistant Commissioner...

173
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,450
...won't mention his name
with such conviction

174
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,158
He'll come definitely

175
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:52,492
Your problem is solved

176
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:54,492
You've been called for
an interview tomorrow

177
00:12:57,908 --> 00:13:00,325
It's tough to even get
an appointment with her

178
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,617
So be there on the dot

179
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,992
Where can I find Mary madam?

180
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,283
What is 'must be'?

181
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,408
Mary madam-

182
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,408
How can you look for her here?

183
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:16,742
She is above all this

184
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:17,783
Go up

185
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:30,325
This is where he directed me

186
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:32,700
There isn't anyone in sight

187
00:13:33,117 --> 00:13:34,700
Maybe it is the floor above this

188
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:36,283
That's the water tank place

189
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:38,492
Hey young man!
Who are you looking for?

190
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,367
I was looking for Mary madam

191
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,325
You carry on, I can
look for her myself

192
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:45,075
Did sore throat Sakthivel
send you here?

193
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:52,908
I am Mary

194
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:56,867
Got your resume?

195
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,867
Akka...?

196
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,533
Have you brought your resume?

197
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:07,783
Hey! What's this?

198
00:14:07,908 --> 00:14:10,033
Haven't you got
a basic degree?

199
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:15,450
You could have at least
graduated through Open university

200
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:20,492
Students from IIT and IIM
are jobless and loitering around

201
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:22,950
You could have at least
written the TNPC exam

202
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:23,992
What is that, akka?

203
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:25,117
Height of ignorance!

204
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:27,492
If you give this there...

205
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,408
...even the job I do here
will be 'gone with the wind'!

206
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:34,242
Forget it, dude
Take my advice

207
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:36,158
My office is looking
for delivery boys

208
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,533
Come and join there

209
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:38,742
What...a courier job?

210
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:39,700
No chance

211
00:14:39,742 --> 00:14:41,117
I have to roast
in the hot sun

212
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:44,158
If you want to be in the shade
then open a 'pan' shop under a canopy!

213
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:46,367
A courier has to walk
up and down every road

214
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,283
I'll buy you that ikran we saw in
'Avatar' and you can fly on its back

215
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,450
I can book a room
in Hotel Chola for him

216
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,658
You can ask your clients
to collect the covers there

217
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:54,533
My head is spinning

218
00:14:54,617 --> 00:14:56,075
Hereafter your head need not spin

219
00:14:56,158 --> 00:14:58,158
You don't have to spin
like a top to find a job

220
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,117
I have spoken
to my best friend

221
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:02,992
In Chennai alone,
he has 10 to 15 branches

222
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:08,742
My friend A.C.Sakthivel is coming
to meet me regarding a job now

223
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:14,075
When he was 6 years, he went
for a dip in the river Cauvery

224
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:16,867
He fell into the river and
the current dragged him away

225
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,158
As if he will be dragged away
by Tamannaah if he falls into the river

226
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:21,450
Come to the point

227
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:24,867
I dived in and
saved his life

228
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,283
Don't treat him
like everyone else

229
00:15:29,492 --> 00:15:35,367
This friendship is not based on
money, fame or home-town kinship

230
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:37,492
It's a divine bond
crossing all these barriers

231
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:39,158
Time for my conference

232
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:43,950
Note that

233
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:45,825
Bring me the audit file

234
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,533
- Muthusamy
- Yes, madam?

235
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:54,075
A man by name A.C.Sakthivel
will soon be here to see our boss

236
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:56,575
His childhood friend it seems

237
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,158
You know what our boss
told me about him?

238
00:15:59,242 --> 00:16:01,575
The reason I am here
is only because of him

239
00:16:01,617 --> 00:16:02,492
More than that...

240
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,908
...I am alive all because of him

241
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:12,283
He will reel out
colorful stories like this

242
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:14,117
Don't believe any of it

243
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:19,700
We share the misfortune
of belonging to the same town

244
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:22,242
I have no other link with him

245
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,783
When he comes,
tell him I've gone abroad

246
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:31,617
For 1...no, 6 months
and send him away

247
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,158
If he does not go
ask the watchman...

248
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:36,492
...to throw him out
by the scruff of his neck

249
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:40,533
What do you want?

250
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:42,742
I don't want anything

251
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:45,742
He deserves this
and much more

252
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,033
Is this Mr A.C.Sakthivel?

253
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:50,742
He won't step in here again

254
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:51,492
Why?

255
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:54,408
Because he just died
a 100 deaths a while ago

256
00:16:54,492 --> 00:16:55,617
How do you know?

257
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,742
Because we are
about to cremate him

258
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,075
Sir, watch your step

259
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,283
I can't bear it

260
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:08,742
We've reached the hospital

261
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:10,325
Get down
Watch your step

262
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:13,533
Careful...careful

263
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:14,450
What happened?

264
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,450
She suddenly complained
of stomach cramps

265
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:17,617
Duty doctor will see you

266
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,742
Bear the pain for
a few more minutes

267
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:21,283
Pay the auto driver

268
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:23,408
I'll get the stretcher

269
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:26,950
Please bear the pain, dear

270
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:31,367
Please hold on, dear

271
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:37,575
Your wife has
suffered a miscarriage

272
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:50,117
Our neighbors are walking
to a temple tomorrow

273
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:51,158
Let them go

274
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:52,533
I would like to
join them too

275
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:54,617
But you can't even walk
around a shopping mall

276
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,950
Every joint of yours will ache
You'll be flat for 2 hours

277
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:58,742
How will you walk
the whole journey?

278
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:01,908
They claim if I tie a toy cradle
to the neem tree over there...

279
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:03,908
...we'll be blessed with a baby

280
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:08,325
Look, we will be blessed with
a baby only if we are destined

281
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:10,533
How many doctors
we have consulted?

282
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:14,992
I don't want to
ruin your faith

283
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:16,408
Go, because you want to

284
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,700
What time should you leave?

285
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:18,617
4:00 a.m tomorrow

286
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,742
Now go to bed

287
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:25,783
Tell me, dude

288
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:27,742
What should I tell you?

289
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:29,408
You are our witness, I say

290
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:31,242
No sign of you
That's why I called

291
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:32,658
Where are you?

292
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,033
Sorry, dude
I clean forgot

293
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:35,117
What the heck!

294
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:37,075
We've been sitting here
in court waiting for you

295
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,742
Okay, I'll be there

296
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:47,950
What are you doing?

297
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:49,783
Sleeping
What do you want?

298
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:52,408
Still sleeping?
It's past noon

299
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:54,992
By now all the wine shops
must have minted money!

300
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:57,450
Why are you rambling?
What do you want?

301
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:58,867
I have to be in court

302
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,408
I forgot, please go and
deliver the covers for me

303
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,408
What?

304
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:04,992
No way

305
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:07,033
For my sake, please

306
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,617
Royal pain!

307
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:23,158
Sir, who's Kavya here?

308
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:25,117
I'm a customer
Go in and check

309
00:19:25,158 --> 00:19:27,117
I went out of my way
to come all the way here

310
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,367
Now I must go inside, huh?

311
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,908
Is it air-conditioned inside?

312
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,867
It's a wonder if lights
work in this shop

313
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:33,908
There's power outage
Should be back in a while

314
00:19:33,992 --> 00:19:35,908
Is it so?
Okay, I'll adjust

315
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,200
- Sir, who's Kavya?
- What do you want?

316
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:40,450
- She's got a courier
- Go upstairs and check

317
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:43,283
If you see her,
give it to her

318
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,242
Otherwise drop it
in that dust bin over there

319
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:46,242
Ordering me around

320
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:47,242
Then who will sign?

321
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:50,908
As if he's popular hero Ajith
and we want his autograph

322
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:52,950
Who the heck is he?

323
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:56,367
Kavya, please come here

324
00:20:04,742 --> 00:20:07,908
'Is this the Kavya I had
to deliver the cover to?'

325
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:25,950
Did you check
the consignment?

326
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:27,242
Not yet, Kavya

327
00:20:27,742 --> 00:20:30,742
You know I don't like it
if you shirk your work?

328
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,242
Sir, I'm a youngster
who has got lots to learn

329
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:45,617
You are old and experienced

330
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:47,825
When I walked off in a huff
shouldn't you have said...

331
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,908
'Sonny, wrong, this is
not the way to deliver'

332
00:20:49,992 --> 00:20:52,325
'You must find the recipient
wherever she may be'

333
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:55,742
'Hand it over to her
and get her signature'

334
00:20:56,617 --> 00:20:58,492
Will you just take it
if I drop it here?

335
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,575
I'm young, sir

336
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:02,200
Please don't play
with my future

337
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:03,992
I missed by a hair's breadth!

338
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:06,658
You have a table and chair
at the reception to top it all

339
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,742
It's wrong
Very wrong

340
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,242
Mr Kesari, getting late
for the function

341
00:21:12,283 --> 00:21:13,283
Waiting only for you

342
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:14,242
Hurry up, sir

343
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:15,533
Give me a minute

344
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:25,033
(Hindi Bhajan)

345
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:35,075
Distribute sweets to everyone

346
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:37,533
Your sugar level might
go up, watch it

347
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:38,908
Please help yourself

348
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,158
You sang very well

349
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,117
Kavya?

350
00:22:02,617 --> 00:22:05,992
'If she feels
the same way I do...'

351
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,950
'...then our love
will definitely bloom!'

352
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:10,242
Thank God, power is back

353
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:14,742
What?

354
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:38,825
"Praise be to Lord Rama"

355
00:22:38,908 --> 00:22:43,325
In the middle of the night
a husky voice singing such a song?

356
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,783
Could it be the souls of
the dead freedom fighters?

357
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,200
"Praise be to Lord Rama"

358
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:54,325
"Praise be to Rama who wed Sita,
who purifies even the sinners"

359
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:56,158
Usually boys will dream of...

360
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,533
...Kareena Kapoor
and Kajal Aggarwal

361
00:22:58,617 --> 00:23:01,658
But for a change, Gandhiji
walks in my friend's dream!

362
00:23:01,783 --> 00:23:04,408
This patriotism sure is
an all time national record!

363
00:23:04,825 --> 00:23:06,158
I love you, darling

364
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:07,908
No more film songs
from now on

365
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:09,325
Did he say love?

366
00:23:09,408 --> 00:23:11,158
Shouldn't sleep with
one who is in love

367
00:23:11,242 --> 00:23:12,283
Or a tuberculosis patient

368
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:14,242
The latter will kill
with his coughing stint

369
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:16,450
The lover will kill
with his lament

370
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:20,742
"Praise be to Lord Rama"

371
00:23:20,825 --> 00:23:24,992
"Praise be to Rama who wed Sita,
who purifies even the sinners"

372
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:32,325
How can you sleep irresponsibly
with an interview this morning?

373
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:39,617
Water is the best alarm!

374
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:50,408
In an urgent situation, I'm unable
to get a good bad word to cuss you

375
00:23:50,617 --> 00:23:52,658
Why are you laughing
like a buffalo coughing?

376
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:56,408
Why have you tied a pillow
like a head phone sticking out?

377
00:23:56,492 --> 00:23:59,450
The way your bro-in-law tortured me,
I could've shut my ears with doors

378
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:02,450
Like a bride on her wedding night
he didn't let me sleep at all

379
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:05,492
Just now this body got shut down
and you restarted it immediately

380
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:07,117
If you disturb me again...

381
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,992
...I'll stick a coin in your belly button
and throw you inside the well

382
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:10,742
Get lost

383
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,575
Fine, treat me like
a clay clone of Ganesha

384
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:15,283
My bro-in-law has gone for
his interview 1/2 an hour early!

385
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:17,950
That's what matters
You sleep, my prince

386
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:36,242
- What, my boy?
- When will you open the store?

387
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:37,533
Very soon
What do you want?

388
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:38,450
Kavya-

389
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:39,492
Whaaat?

390
00:24:39,617 --> 00:24:41,117
I want to buy
'khadi' material

391
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,408
When youngsters these days
loiter in faded shirts and torn jeans...

392
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,492
...you're insisting on
buying hand spun fabric

393
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:48,242
And waiting for
the store to open

394
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:50,492
When I think of you,
I get goose bumps

395
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:52,408
Basically we are
from a 'khadi' family

396
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,325
They will open in
another few minutes

397
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:55,533
Please wait

398
00:25:24,617 --> 00:25:29,033
"Maya O Maya
What did you do to me?"

399
00:25:29,117 --> 00:25:33,867
"I sent you a letter
through my eyes, dear"

400
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,200
"Maya O Maya
I followed you"

401
00:25:38,242 --> 00:25:42,617
"Yearning like a shadow"

402
00:25:42,783 --> 00:25:47,158
"I've never felt dizzy about anything"

403
00:25:47,242 --> 00:25:51,450
"This love is a heartache's offspring"

404
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:56,492
"Without you seeing me even
I watch you 24x7"

405
00:25:56,575 --> 00:25:58,617
"Aiyo...aiyaiyo!"

406
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,408
"When this tender love and care
invades you from nowhere..."

407
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:08,033
"...like a few pegs with verve
intoxicates your cranial nerve"

408
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:12,325
"Open your eyes to see
it is a dream only"

409
00:26:12,408 --> 00:26:17,533
"Poor you! Got caught
Love's web and what not!"

410
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:21,867
It's okay, get me
that courier job

411
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:24,867
You may have to
roast in the sun

412
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,825
So can I buy an ikran
like in the film 'Avatar'?

413
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:29,242
How will you walk
up and down every road?

414
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:30,658
So can I check into Hotel Chola?

415
00:26:30,783 --> 00:26:32,492
And ask everyone to
come and collect it?

416
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:33,367
Tell them, akka

417
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,908
Before he changes his mind...

418
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:37,033
...convince your boss
and get him that job

419
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:39,117
I want to cover only
Parry's corner area

420
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:42,242
Like the 'kumkum' dots
on 'Ayudha pooja'

421
00:26:42,325 --> 00:26:43,867
...why do you tattoo my forehead?

422
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:53,367
"Love is just a wave from the sea"

423
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:58,450
"Wants to touch the shore eagerly"

424
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,617
"Once it reaches the shore"

425
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,075
"...it dissolves in silence once more"

426
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:11,325
"Are you aware, for your sake"

427
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:15,783
"...a heart beats asleep or awake?"

428
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:21,242
"Without talking to you
I talk to myself, so new"

429
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:23,408
"Aiyo...aiyaiyo!"

430
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:27,950
"If this tender love and care
invades you from nowhere..."

431
00:27:28,075 --> 00:27:32,242
"...like a few pegs with verve
intoxicates your cranial nerve"

432
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:37,200
"You'll open your eyes to see
it is a dream only"

433
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:41,617
"Poor you! Got caught
In love's web and what not!"

434
00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:27,408
"Love after it is expressed
will vanish once professed"

435
00:28:27,825 --> 00:28:36,283
"Love that's nestled in the heart
will bloom forever like a work of art"

436
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:45,158
"If by chance she rejects me
my life will leave me instantly"

437
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,200
"What happens to my love, dearie?
My mind will be in a quandary"

438
00:28:50,283 --> 00:28:52,492
"Aiyo...aiyaiyo!"

439
00:28:52,575 --> 00:29:01,450
"Maya O Maya, my dear
With my eyes I sent you a letter"

440
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:10,575
"Maya O Maya I followed you
Yearning like a shadow"

441
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:15,283
"Uncs, aiyo...aiyo
Love is a game, oh!"

442
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:19,742
"Like Temple run it will make you
run a marathon, dude"

443
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,325
"Like Angry Birds it will hit your chest"

444
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:29,492
"And make you fly in a tizzy east or west"

445
00:29:39,242 --> 00:29:42,742
'Did I join this job
rather impulsively?'

446
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:45,867
'Thought if I take up this job,
she'll get a cover delivered daily'

447
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,950
'I can develop my love
using this delivery as an excuse'

448
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:52,242
'Not even a single delivery
near that street'

449
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:55,617
'Can't someone send a cover?'

450
00:30:41,742 --> 00:30:43,492
It doesn't seem to tally

451
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:48,117
You attend to this
I'll be back

452
00:30:52,783 --> 00:30:53,908
She won't come

453
00:30:55,283 --> 00:30:56,242
What?

454
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,867
If she suddenly says
she won't come, how is it fair?

455
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:00,367
Ask her to come

456
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,908
It will take some time
Give me the cover

457
00:31:03,242 --> 00:31:04,533
How is it possible?

458
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:06,950
Our company also has
rules and regulations

459
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:09,200
We must deliver
only to the recipient

460
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,450
I just have to wait
a little longer, right?

461
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:12,992
It will take 2 hours

462
00:31:13,908 --> 00:31:14,950
That's okay

463
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,242
Even if it takes 1 whole day,
I'll wait and deliver it

464
00:31:17,283 --> 00:31:18,492
But she is-

465
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:20,367
Will you let me do my job?

466
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,117
Please go and
arrange those dolls

467
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,242
'He is definitely a madcap'

468
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:58,992
Hey! Didn't I ask you
to collect the courier?

469
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:01,117
I believe he will only
hand it over to you

470
00:32:07,117 --> 00:32:08,575
Duty, dignity, discipline

471
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:11,117
If I don't finish my job,
I can't even sleep

472
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:15,950
I asked you to hand over
the cover and leave

473
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:17,242
A minor issue here

474
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:18,617
I'll resolve it
and call back

475
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:20,242
Sorry, you said something

476
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:23,992
I had asked you
to give it and go

477
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:25,200
Why didn't you do so?

478
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:27,242
How can I leave
without seeing you?

479
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:31,367
How can I leave without delivering
it to you and getting your signature?

480
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,033
If we go to a temple
and the shrine is closed

481
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:38,158
Do we just see the priest, place our
offering and return without seeing God?

482
00:32:38,242 --> 00:32:40,158
That's it
Do you get it?

483
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:41,242
Here you are

484
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:46,992
Kavya, come here for a minute

485
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:48,450
I'm coming, madam

486
00:33:08,617 --> 00:33:10,492
Don't you think
this is too much?

487
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:12,992
You're looking at it as if
she hugged and kissed you

488
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,075
And gave it to you as a gift

489
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,033
You stole it from her, right?

490
00:33:17,117 --> 00:33:19,033
That too circling it
as if it's a globe

491
00:33:19,117 --> 00:33:21,242
Whatever you say,
this pen is special

492
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:22,242
Not only this

493
00:33:22,325 --> 00:33:24,033
Even if it's an used clip of hers

494
00:33:24,075 --> 00:33:26,200
Or the mug she has
sipped coffee from

495
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:27,492
They are all precious to me

496
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:29,658
To collect the tossed
mugs and plates...

497
00:33:29,783 --> 00:33:31,575
...there are peddlers
going around with sacks

498
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:33,158
Don't rob them
of their daily wages!

499
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:34,992
If you want your love
to be promoted...

500
00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:36,867
...try to get her
feelings on display

501
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,325
'Consider it done'

502
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,950
'Where is my girl?'

503
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,742
Check the number of towels

504
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:53,242
Is no one here
in this counter?

505
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:55,867
Hey! Go and
get the cover

506
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,033
He'll talk rules and
regulations to me

507
00:33:58,117 --> 00:33:59,158
You go yourself

508
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,242
What do you want, sir?

509
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:01,950
Go and sit there

510
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:03,158
Go

511
00:34:10,242 --> 00:34:11,783
Hand over the courier and leave

512
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:13,450
I'm not here to
deliver a courier

513
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:16,575
I'm here as your customer
to buy a shirt

514
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:25,908
- Tell me the size
- Take a guess?

515
00:34:28,825 --> 00:34:29,825
Tell me-

516
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,242
It's 40

517
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,242
All these are 40

518
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,825
Take your pick

519
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:40,367
That row-

520
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:41,867
Those are very expensive

521
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,950
If the customer asks
please show it

522
00:34:49,992 --> 00:34:51,367
Which one do you want?

523
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:54,742
Can you get that?

524
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:56,742
- This one?
- Not that

525
00:34:56,825 --> 00:34:59,325
One that matches
your dress...that blue

526
00:34:59,408 --> 00:35:01,242
No, I like blue

527
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:29,117
Pay the bill at the counter

528
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,825
Your shirts will
be sent over there

529
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:32,658
We can deal with
the payment later

530
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:34,242
Let me first try it out

531
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,992
Hello, it's enough if
you try out just one

532
00:35:37,075 --> 00:35:38,242
Then what about the rest?

533
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:40,242
The rest are all
same size, same fit

534
00:35:40,242 --> 00:35:41,825
No, I don't want
to take that risk

535
00:35:41,908 --> 00:35:42,783
I'll be right back

536
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:44,242
Looks like he's jobless

537
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:46,867
How are you
so bang on?!

538
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:03,450
What do you want?

539
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,700
Am I looking good?

540
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:09,950
My job is to only give you
the shirt of your choice?

541
00:36:10,242 --> 00:36:12,867
Whether it looks good
or the fit is right, all that-

542
00:36:12,908 --> 00:36:13,617
All that?

543
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,658
Is up to you

544
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:16,617
Why are you getting
so tensed for this?

545
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,117
A boyfriend will
only ask his girlfriend

546
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,533
If the girlfriend likes it
the boyfriend will buy it

547
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:23,117
In the case of a married couple...

548
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,450
...the husband will ask his wife

549
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,325
He'll buy if his wife approves

550
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:29,158
What I'm trying to say is
for those who shop as a pair...

551
00:36:29,242 --> 00:36:30,950
...the girlfriend or wife will help

552
00:36:31,033 --> 00:36:33,158
But for someone
unattached like me...

553
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:35,283
...if as a sales girl
you don't voice your opinion

554
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,700
...how can I decide?

555
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:38,117
Is it looking good on me?

556
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:40,117
Oh! Maybe it is
a bit too plain

557
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,158
One minute

558
00:37:00,075 --> 00:37:00,783
Can I help you?

559
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,033
We have an appointment
with the gynecologist

560
00:37:03,075 --> 00:37:04,825
Register over there
They will call you

561
00:37:05,742 --> 00:37:06,533
Ma, sit here

562
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:08,242
I'll register her name

563
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:10,367
If I give birth to a baby boy...

564
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,033
...it seems your mother has taken
a vow to break 108 coconuts

565
00:37:13,117 --> 00:37:17,325
My father wanting a granddaughter
has already broken 1008 coconuts

566
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:20,617
Even my brother and sister-in-law
want a baby boy it seems

567
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,492
Let them have
a baby boy of their own

568
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:23,867
I want a daughter

569
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:25,617
Please wait outside

570
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:27,158
Doctor will call you

571
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:28,533
I saw the reports

572
00:37:30,783 --> 00:37:33,117
From now on
you must be careful

573
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,200
You'll have initial nausea

574
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:37,492
Don't worry

575
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:39,950
Take adequate rest

576
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:41,242
Eat well

577
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:45,450
Most important
be happy all the time

578
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,783
This is vitamin supplement

579
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:49,533
Take according to
my prescription

580
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,492
When should we come next, doctor?

581
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:52,533
I'll see you on the 2nd

582
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:57,033
Our daughter-in-law will soon
give us a grandson, dear

583
00:37:57,242 --> 00:38:01,617
Buy new clothes and 'biriyani'
for all the workers in our mill

584
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,450
Call our uncle in Andheri

585
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:06,117
Inform our sister-in-law also

586
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,783
A fire engine just sped past
Now another one

587
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:09,825
Why?

588
00:38:09,908 --> 00:38:11,242
A huge fire accident

589
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:13,367
Most probably
a short circuit problem

590
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:14,617
Is it an old building?

591
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:19,158
Right from our college days
Khadi Bhavan has been a landmark

592
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:31,950
Sorry, akka

593
00:39:32,117 --> 00:39:33,617
What's wrong with you?

594
00:39:34,075 --> 00:39:36,533
I heard there was
a fire in Khadi

595
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:38,075
That's the branch
in Mount road

596
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:40,825
That fire has been extinguished
and it's all back to normal

597
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,117
This smoke...?

598
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:45,492
Noor Bhai

599
00:39:54,908 --> 00:39:56,783
Fan the incense
all over his head

600
00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:07,033
He comes daily, won't even
take out his wallet

601
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:08,700
Wonder why he even comes!

602
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,658
I was so embarrassed

603
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:17,450
As it is that girl doesn't
give me even a first glance!

604
00:40:17,533 --> 00:40:19,408
I have no idea
what to do now

605
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,742
The girl is to be
blamed, not you

606
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:24,117
Why do you say so?

607
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:28,533
What if there is a manufacturing
defect in the model you picked?

608
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:33,533
Some boys hate the sight of girls

609
00:40:33,825 --> 00:40:35,533
Oh! That type

610
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:38,117
Some girls can't stand
the sight of boys

611
00:40:38,158 --> 00:40:38,908
Is that so?

612
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,950
Like the film 'Fire'

613
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:45,450
Some won't have the word 'love'
in their dictionary at all

614
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:47,033
In their book of 'life'...

615
00:40:47,117 --> 00:40:49,075
...the page 'wedding'
will be totally missing

616
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:53,033
So figure out which type
your model fits into

617
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:54,367
Feeling sleepy?

618
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:55,325
Slight

619
00:40:55,408 --> 00:40:57,033
I preached too long, right?

620
00:40:57,117 --> 00:40:58,533
Kind of boring

621
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:00,200
Go to bed

622
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:01,908
Help me somehow, dude

623
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,367
First courier a letter to her
with these exact words

624
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,867
'Obstacles in getting married?'

625
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,117
'Frustration in life?'

626
00:41:07,158 --> 00:41:08,158
'Love failure?'

627
00:41:08,242 --> 00:41:11,200
'Whatever your problem
we can solve it for you'

628
00:41:11,283 --> 00:41:13,533
'Free phone call
Immediate wedding'

629
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,367
Who could have sent this?

630
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:24,158
Thank God!

631
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,117
What are you looking for?

632
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,742
The exit door

633
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,325
You mark your attendance
like our Khadi Bhavan staff daily

634
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:39,617
And you won't know
the way to go out?

635
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,700
I know

636
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:42,825
Oh! The door is over there

637
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,533
If there is a door
it should lead out, no?

638
00:41:44,575 --> 00:41:45,825
I can find my way

639
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,950
I need to talk

640
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:52,200
Nasa, bang on!

641
00:41:52,283 --> 00:41:53,617
Sure, we can talk

642
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:54,783
I am-

643
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:55,867
You are?

644
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:07,283
I'm working here
for the past 3 years

645
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:11,533
Once a year on 'Gandhi jayanthi'
I'll get a package through courier

646
00:42:11,908 --> 00:42:16,825
After which till October 2nd of
the next year I won't get any

647
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:20,617
But very strange I get
a package delivered daily

648
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:23,908
Sometimes 2 or 3
on the same day

649
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,117
What is happening?

650
00:42:25,825 --> 00:42:28,325
Looks like you're saying
just to see you...

651
00:42:28,408 --> 00:42:32,742
...I pick up some trash
and courier it to you

652
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:34,658
I have 101 better things to do

653
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,700
I didn't mean it that way

654
00:42:36,783 --> 00:42:37,825
Then...?

655
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:42,658
If you have that kind of thought
brewing inside you, think again!

656
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,825
I'm already committed to someone

657
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:54,033
I'm also committed

658
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,825
Acting pricey

659
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,533
I'm also committed

660
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:05,367
You can go

661
00:43:08,742 --> 00:43:12,075
Tigers and chicks in our town
are few and far between

662
00:43:12,158 --> 00:43:14,658
Male-female ratio
is 1000-600

663
00:43:14,742 --> 00:43:16,117
Dating a chic chick...

664
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,533
...is like getting a ticket
on any train during Christmas

665
00:43:18,617 --> 00:43:19,950
Very tough

666
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:23,533
'Only the girl who opens
her mouth will eat the fritter'

667
00:43:23,575 --> 00:43:26,075
Go and express your love
to her face to face

668
00:43:26,242 --> 00:43:27,825
I'm behind her 24x7

669
00:43:27,908 --> 00:43:30,158
How is she committed
without my knowledge?

670
00:43:30,242 --> 00:43:31,950
I should profess
my love directly

671
00:43:32,158 --> 00:43:34,783
'Wondering why you've got
a courier at your doorstep?'

672
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:36,075
'Not just this'

673
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:38,617
'I was the one who sent
all the couriers you got so far'

674
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,533
'Kavya, it was love
at first sight for me'

675
00:43:43,825 --> 00:43:48,283
'Only to see you daily
I took up a job I hated'

676
00:43:48,367 --> 00:43:51,867
'The more I saw you
I started liking my job'

677
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,200
'The moment you said
you are committed...'

678
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:57,533
'...my blood pressure that shot up
has not reduced till now'

679
00:43:57,575 --> 00:43:59,783
'I swear on my mother'

680
00:43:59,867 --> 00:44:01,575
'When I told you
I was committed...'

681
00:44:01,658 --> 00:44:02,742
'...I meant only you'

682
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:15,408
It hurts

683
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:18,533
I can't bear it

684
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:24,158
I can't tolerate the pain

685
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:30,117
We tried our best

686
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:32,492
Your wife has miscarried

687
00:44:32,575 --> 00:44:35,033
How can that be, doctor?

688
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,075
She took all the medicine
just as you prescribed

689
00:44:38,158 --> 00:44:39,950
I didn't let her
lift even a teaspoon!

690
00:44:40,075 --> 00:44:41,158
How could it happen?

691
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:46,367
Selvaraj, this can
happen to anyone

692
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,200
Don't blame yourself

693
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,325
I told you not to
get married to her

694
00:44:53,408 --> 00:44:54,742
Did you listen to me?

695
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,617
I thought she would
give us a heir very soon

696
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,533
Wretched girl!
She killed our heir

697
00:45:00,658 --> 00:45:03,742
She could have died instead

698
00:45:09,075 --> 00:45:10,492
What happened?

699
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,700
Call for help

700
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:14,367
Quick

701
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,783
Don't know who she is

702
00:45:16,867 --> 00:45:20,242
She jumped from the balcony
before I could even warn her

703
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:22,158
I thought she was
simply standing there

704
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,783
Looks very young
What happened?

705
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:25,783
She had an abortion
just this morning it seems

706
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:27,700
Is that why
she committed suicide?

707
00:45:27,742 --> 00:45:29,450
Poor thing!

708
00:45:37,075 --> 00:45:39,700
I carried out the abortion
for Meena just as we planned

709
00:45:39,783 --> 00:45:41,950
I completed all other procedures

710
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,158
Don't worry

711
00:46:00,283 --> 00:46:02,492
We'll find the perfect match
for your eyes

712
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:04,950
You'll get your vision back

713
00:46:39,617 --> 00:46:41,492
When my brother lost his vision...

714
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:44,283
...our group of companies
lost all hope and confidence

715
00:46:44,325 --> 00:46:45,742
We were at a dead end

716
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:48,575
We tried many avenues
but had no luck at all

717
00:46:48,658 --> 00:46:51,533
What you've done now is a miracle

718
00:46:51,617 --> 00:46:54,242
I don't know
how to thank you

719
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:58,617
On behalf of my brother
please accept 5 million Euro

720
00:47:00,825 --> 00:47:01,742
Akka?

721
00:47:02,325 --> 00:47:04,117
Oh! You're here

722
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:05,783
Why are you
looking off color?

723
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:07,825
Just a headache
That's all

724
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,492
I'll take you
to the hospital

725
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:13,075
I just took her to the clinic
in the next street

726
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,575
She's saying
it's just a headache

727
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:16,950
And you took her to the clinic

728
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:17,783
What happened?

729
00:47:17,825 --> 00:47:19,283
Nothing to get tensed about

730
00:47:19,325 --> 00:47:22,450
Your sister has conceived
Doctor told us just now

731
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,242
Bro-in-law!

732
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,158
I'm so thrilled

733
00:47:31,242 --> 00:47:33,867
Don't give birth to
a hodgepodge like this man

734
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:36,867
Give us a cute
baby girl like you

735
00:47:37,033 --> 00:47:40,533
Uncle, don't take her to
these random roadside clinics

736
00:47:40,617 --> 00:47:43,950
We have to choose
the best hospital for akka

737
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,742
Soon a small voice
will be born here

738
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:53,492
Which will start prattling
in this scraggy tone

739
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:55,200
When are you treating us?

740
00:47:55,283 --> 00:47:56,450
You want a treat?

741
00:47:56,575 --> 00:47:57,575
Scraggy tone, huh?

742
00:47:57,658 --> 00:48:01,408
I thought of ordering
an extra beer for you

743
00:48:01,492 --> 00:48:03,783
Now you get zilch
Go to bed

744
00:48:03,867 --> 00:48:06,242
I know what you'll be up to
after packing us off to bed

745
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:07,575
Let your wife take rest tonight

746
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:35,950
"Drinks on the terrace, friend?"

747
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:38,450
"Or in a shop in a dead end"

748
00:48:39,325 --> 00:48:41,325
"A star filled room as godsend"

749
00:48:44,867 --> 00:48:46,450
"Rock and roll in a tipsy tide"

750
00:48:47,575 --> 00:48:49,325
"Everything else sweep aside"

751
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,450
"No control, be reckless"

752
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:54,825
"Burn to ashes your shyness"

753
00:48:55,575 --> 00:48:58,325
"What if the chicken is blind?"

754
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:01,533
"Taste is what satiates the mind"

755
00:49:03,992 --> 00:49:08,075
"Make merry...have a ball
'Cheers' to brave hearts all"

756
00:49:08,117 --> 00:49:12,200
"Let your hair down
Dude, all smile, no frown"

757
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,950
"A world without pleasure
Dude, what joy will it offer?"

758
00:49:15,075 --> 00:49:19,200
"Make merry...have a ball
'Cheers' to brave hearts all"

759
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:23,283
"Kick up your heels
Dude, shake on new deals"

760
00:49:23,325 --> 00:49:26,117
"A world without pleasure
Dude, what bliss will it offer?"

761
00:49:59,367 --> 00:50:02,242
"Muniamma...my country chick"

762
00:50:02,325 --> 00:50:04,867
"Serve me pickle, a spicy kick"

763
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:09,658
"If no pickle to lick
give me your finger, quick!"

764
00:50:10,283 --> 00:50:15,533
"Your body spurs the adrenalin
Doubt if you're a girl or gin"

765
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:21,200
"It sparkles, it shines to the tip
It lures, it allures, what is it?"

766
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:25,242
"Make merry...no hiccup
See double, live it up"

767
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:29,367
"Go the extra mile and yard
Dude, let down your guard"

768
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,950
"If it is zippo...?"

769
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:32,575
Push the tempo!

770
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:43,575
I've been researching
for quite a few years now

771
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:54,283
You're aware some diseases
can be cured with medicine

772
00:51:54,325 --> 00:51:57,450
Diseases that can't be
cured with medicine...

773
00:51:57,533 --> 00:51:59,075
...can be cured by surgery

774
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:04,158
But what about diseases
both medicine and surgery can't cure?

775
00:52:04,283 --> 00:52:06,075
I'll show you
some clippings now

776
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:10,492
He's a millionaire in Germany

777
00:52:10,575 --> 00:52:13,908
In an accident his optical nerve
was severed and he lost his vision

778
00:52:13,992 --> 00:52:16,867
Through my research
he has regained his eyesight

779
00:52:16,908 --> 00:52:19,158
He is now able to see
up to a distance of 5 meters

780
00:52:19,242 --> 00:52:21,867
This man is a renowned
football player in Europe

781
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:23,825
He got injured
while playing a match

782
00:52:23,908 --> 00:52:26,283
Hurt his spinal cord
and was bed-ridden

783
00:52:26,325 --> 00:52:30,742
Through my research
he's taking toddler steps now

784
00:52:30,908 --> 00:52:32,950
If he plays football again...

785
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:36,575
...his club is willing to pay us
any amount, sky is the limit

786
00:52:36,658 --> 00:52:44,617
Likewise I've cured several patients
suffering from Alzheimer's, Parkinson's

787
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:46,950
Through my research

788
00:52:47,075 --> 00:52:49,950
For such patients
my research is...

789
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:50,825
...their last hope

790
00:52:58,242 --> 00:53:01,908
As soon as a woman conceives,
the cells that develop in her embryo...

791
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:03,283
...are called stem cells

792
00:53:04,658 --> 00:53:07,200
These stem cells
grow in the fetus

793
00:53:07,283 --> 00:53:10,908
And develop into different
organs like eyes, heart etc...

794
00:53:10,992 --> 00:53:12,658
...to become a newborn baby

795
00:53:12,825 --> 00:53:14,408
But this stage
is of no use to us

796
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:18,408
We need the cells that grow
in the fetus in the early stage

797
00:53:18,492 --> 00:53:21,492
Quality of being able to change
into any muscle or organ...

798
00:53:21,575 --> 00:53:24,533
...is the unique characteristic
of fetal stem cells

799
00:53:24,617 --> 00:53:26,367
Apart from the fetal stem cells...

800
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:29,325
...from the bone marrow and
umbilical cord in our body

801
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:30,742
...we can also get stem cells

802
00:53:34,325 --> 00:53:36,658
People now are storing
umbilical cord stem cells...

803
00:53:36,742 --> 00:53:39,867
...for future use
in stem cell clinics

804
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:44,325
But the disadvantages are
their count and quality

805
00:53:44,408 --> 00:53:47,117
Stem cells' ability to
change themselves...

806
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,867
...is to a much lesser degree
when compared to fetal cells

807
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:54,908
So what we need is
the fetal stem cell only

808
00:53:54,992 --> 00:53:56,492
In order to get this...

809
00:53:56,575 --> 00:53:59,033
...immediately after conception
it should lead to an abortion

810
00:53:59,117 --> 00:54:00,325
How is that possible?

811
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:03,283
Out of 100 only 1 or 2 patients
will miscarry at this early stage

812
00:54:03,325 --> 00:54:05,367
What if 20 or 30
abortions happen?

813
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,617
How can that happen?

814
00:54:06,742 --> 00:54:08,325
It won't happen
of its own accord

815
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:09,617
We have to make it happen

816
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,700
When women miss
their menstrual periods...

817
00:54:11,742 --> 00:54:15,117
...they will come to us
to check if they're pregnant

818
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,242
If confirmed...

819
00:54:16,283 --> 00:54:19,325
...claiming this to be nutritional
supplements we must prescribe this

820
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:22,742
If they continue
to take this pill...

821
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:25,033
...they will suffer from
severe stomach cramps

822
00:54:25,117 --> 00:54:29,408
At once they will come
rushing to our hospital

823
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:32,242
Under the pretext of check-up,
we must carry out the abortion

824
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:35,450
And take out stem cells in
the early stages from the fetus

825
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:37,658
Through cold storage
we must preserve these cells

826
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,450
And dispatch for research
to European countries

827
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,117
I started these abortions
only in Europe

828
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,158
But the level of awareness
is rather high there

829
00:54:48,242 --> 00:54:50,325
I know what you prescribed
to my sister was illegal

830
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,825
I will come with the cops
to put you behind bars

831
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:56,325
Unfortunately we had to
deal with him this way

832
00:54:56,533 --> 00:54:59,283
No one can stop me

833
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:02,450
Media and police
got wind of my research

834
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:04,533
And they came to
our lab to search

835
00:55:04,617 --> 00:55:07,742
Since they couldn't find
any evidence, we escaped

836
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:10,367
- What was the research about?
- Stem cells

837
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,033
Not being able to continue
such a lucrative research...

838
00:55:13,117 --> 00:55:14,908
...when my partner was perturbed

839
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:16,492
...I told him not to worry

840
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:19,575
I offered to take this Operation
to another country

841
00:55:21,242 --> 00:55:23,325
That country too has
rules and regulations

842
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:24,992
But the rule followed
by everyone...

843
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:26,283
...break the rules

844
00:55:26,325 --> 00:55:29,533
That's when I decided to
bring this Operation to India

845
00:55:36,325 --> 00:55:37,367
Isn't it a sin?

846
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:39,867
They will feel bad
for the first 6 months

847
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,867
Then they will conceive
and be back again

848
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,908
Whether we stand #1
or not in any field...

849
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:45,325
...no one can beat our census

850
00:55:45,908 --> 00:55:50,742
For research we require
hundreds of fetal stem cells

851
00:55:51,408 --> 00:55:52,617
At the same time

852
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,242
We should have
almost 50-60 abortions

853
00:55:57,117 --> 00:55:59,367
If this hospital alone
handles so many abortions...

854
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:00,700
...it will hit the headlines

855
00:56:00,742 --> 00:56:03,992
Press and media
will bury me alive

856
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:06,367
You take on Madurai
You handle Coimbatore

857
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,075
You deal with
Kanyakumari district

858
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,992
This is a very sensitive issue

859
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,575
Doctors won't volunteer

860
00:56:11,658 --> 00:56:14,533
Even if a woman
miscarries naturally...

861
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:17,367
...those stem cells cannot
be used for research

862
00:56:19,867 --> 00:56:22,200
The agreed amount will be
credited to your account

863
00:56:23,242 --> 00:56:24,867
- Sir?
- Yes, dear

864
00:56:24,908 --> 00:56:26,575
I need to take off
half a day tomorrow

865
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:27,533
Why?

866
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:30,742
A prospective groom
is coming to see me

867
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:32,533
I'm really happy
to hear that

868
00:56:32,575 --> 00:56:34,617
Every event should
happen at that specific time

869
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,283
What's the groom doing?

870
00:56:36,658 --> 00:56:38,575
Works in a software company

871
00:56:38,658 --> 00:56:39,867
You carry on

872
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:40,950
I'm also best!

873
00:56:40,992 --> 00:56:41,992
You check the accounts

874
00:56:42,075 --> 00:56:43,450
Aren't we tallying it daily?

875
00:56:48,075 --> 00:56:49,450
Everything is normal

876
00:56:49,658 --> 00:56:53,117
Please wait outside
Chief doctor will call you

877
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:03,992
Please follow the prescription
and take this medicine

878
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,992
'My name is Manikandan'

879
00:57:21,033 --> 00:57:24,408
'I'm working in Lakshmi hospital
in Salem as a ward boy'

880
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,075
Time for the meeting
Bring it fast, bro

881
00:57:26,158 --> 00:57:27,033
Wait, toner is empty

882
00:57:27,075 --> 00:57:28,867
I have to fix it
and then bring

883
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,408
Can I bring blank sheets?

884
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:31,742
Why didn't you
give it earlier?

885
00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:33,450
You can't rush me
at the last minute

886
00:57:36,575 --> 00:57:37,950
Sarathy, my phone is missing

887
00:57:38,033 --> 00:57:39,325
Can I use yours?

888
00:57:39,992 --> 00:57:42,158
Phone is ringing but
no one is picking up

889
00:58:05,158 --> 00:58:10,325
'Under the guise
of nutritional pills...'

890
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:13,325
'...fetuses of pregnant women
are being aborted deliberately'

891
00:58:13,575 --> 00:58:14,950
Why are you here so late?

892
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,408
I forgot my cell phone, Sabapathy

893
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:17,367
Okay, bro

894
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:42,617
Where is Manikandan?

895
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,742
He has gone to
his home town

896
00:59:44,973 --> 00:59:47,598
Can you give me
details of this slip?

897
00:59:47,765 --> 00:59:49,348
Delivery was yesterday

898
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:02,265
A man came yesterday
after the booking time

899
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:05,015
He wanted to send urgently
some medicine, prescriptions...

900
01:00:05,098 --> 01:00:06,598
...to Mr Sathyamurthy in Chennai

901
01:00:06,682 --> 01:00:08,140
You know, that social activist

902
01:00:10,765 --> 01:00:12,390
He wanted to send it to him

903
01:00:12,473 --> 01:00:15,140
I was the one who sent that cover
to head office as emergency

904
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:16,682
And dispatched it

905
01:00:17,473 --> 01:00:18,765
Don't worry, sir

906
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,890
We have been in this
business for 20 years

907
01:00:20,932 --> 01:00:23,182
We've never been
accused of 'late delivery'

908
01:00:23,307 --> 01:00:25,557
That cover should have
reached Chennai by now

909
01:00:27,848 --> 01:00:29,682
We are in deep trouble, doctor

910
01:00:29,807 --> 01:00:32,932
One of the ward boys in
my hospital found out our plans

911
01:00:32,973 --> 01:00:36,640
So he has couriered the list of
hospitals, doctors, medicine samples

912
01:00:36,723 --> 01:00:41,557
...to Mr Sathyamurthy in Chennai
He's that popular social activist

913
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:45,348
When I inquired, they say
the cover would've reached by now

914
01:00:45,432 --> 01:00:47,682
If that cover reaches his hands...

915
01:00:47,765 --> 01:00:49,807
...media will crucify us

916
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:52,015
We will all rot in
Tihar jail and die

917
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:52,700
That isn't the po-

918
01:00:53,473 --> 01:00:54,800
Fax me the courier slip

919
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:55,800
Tell me, sir

920
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,910
Go at once to the main hub
of Professional couriers

921
01:00:57,911 --> 01:00:59,870
They have an important
cover concerning us

922
01:00:59,953 --> 01:01:02,078
It should be delivered to my table

923
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:03,995
I'll send you the courier details

924
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:05,620
Start the car

925
01:01:14,311 --> 01:01:16,061
Sir, my name is Manikandan

926
01:01:16,145 --> 01:01:19,728
I had sent a courier from Salem
to Mr Sathyamurthy in Chetpet

927
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:21,020
But I'm here
in Madras now

928
01:01:21,103 --> 01:01:22,520
I would prefer
to give it directly

929
01:01:22,561 --> 01:01:24,353
I can't divulge anything
over the phone

930
01:01:24,395 --> 01:01:25,895
You come with
your identity proof

931
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:26,686
I'll try to help

932
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:28,500
I coming immediately!
Please Hold it sir.

933
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,050
Sir, please check the status

934
01:02:15,508 --> 01:02:18,175
It has been sent for dispatch
Check over there

935
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:26,841
I called you
a little while ago

936
01:02:26,841 --> 01:02:28,425
I need the details
of this courier, sir

937
01:02:28,466 --> 01:02:30,133
I have the required
ID proof, sir

938
01:02:30,216 --> 01:02:31,341
Okay, let me check

939
01:02:31,383 --> 01:02:32,758
This one...this is the one

940
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:35,591
The courier boy took it
for delivery just now

941
01:02:35,675 --> 01:02:36,966
Mr Sathyamurthy is a VIP

942
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:38,966
Won't be proper to send it
through a courier

943
01:02:39,008 --> 01:02:40,008
Please call the boy, sir

944
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,008
- We'll give it in person
- I can't call him back

945
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,008
At least tell us where he is
We can collect it

946
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:45,716
I can't do as per
your whims and fancy

947
01:02:45,758 --> 01:02:47,175
At least call him
It's really urgent

948
01:02:47,258 --> 01:02:48,841
Why don't you get
what I am saying?

949
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:50,341
Understand our situation

950
01:03:03,675 --> 01:03:05,216
This is your area cover

951
01:03:10,383 --> 01:03:11,675
What happened, sir?

952
01:03:12,008 --> 01:03:14,258
Maybe he's in the midst of
traffic, he isn't picking up

953
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:15,425
Please try once more

954
01:03:15,508 --> 01:03:16,383
What a bother!

955
01:03:16,466 --> 01:03:18,383
Wait a minute
This is the list

956
01:03:18,466 --> 01:03:20,758
By now he must have
delivered in these places

957
01:03:20,841 --> 01:03:24,925
Then he has to deliver in
and around Sterling road area

958
01:03:25,008 --> 01:03:27,133
After that, he will go to Chetpet

959
01:03:27,216 --> 01:03:28,883
And deliver it to
Mr Sathyamurthy

960
01:03:28,966 --> 01:03:30,258
In about half an hour

961
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:31,550
- Half an hour?
- Yes, sure

962
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:32,383
What do we do?

963
01:03:32,466 --> 01:03:34,258
There's been an accident
to one of our trucks

964
01:03:34,341 --> 01:03:35,008
Really?

965
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,216
Check this please

966
01:03:36,258 --> 01:03:37,008
1 minute, sir

967
01:03:37,091 --> 01:03:38,383
Wait...I'll be back

968
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:45,508
Sir, courier has been dispatched

969
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:46,716
But the route list is with me

970
01:03:46,758 --> 01:03:48,175
I'll follow that route and get him

971
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:49,258
It should not be delivered

972
01:03:49,383 --> 01:03:50,216
Sir, don't worry

973
01:03:50,258 --> 01:03:51,216
I'll take care

974
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:56,258
The delivery places are
all within 2-3kms only

975
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:58,258
He may not stick to
the route completely

976
01:03:58,341 --> 01:04:00,383
Be ready in the spot
I assign each one of you

977
01:04:00,466 --> 01:04:02,925
If you see the courier
catch hold of him and call me

978
01:04:03,008 --> 01:04:04,383
I'll keep an eye out for him also

979
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,341
Most important, be alert

980
01:04:08,008 --> 01:04:10,091
- Where are you?
- On the way to the office, sir

981
01:04:10,175 --> 01:04:12,966
Go to S.V.Luggage corner
in Nelson Manickam road now

982
01:04:13,008 --> 01:04:14,216
A courier boy will come there

983
01:04:14,258 --> 01:04:15,883
He has a cover
we need to collect

984
01:04:15,966 --> 01:04:17,633
If he comes, keep talking to him

985
01:04:17,716 --> 01:04:18,841
I'm coming there

986
01:04:21,466 --> 01:04:23,133
Sir, Mr Kadiresan?

987
01:04:23,216 --> 01:04:25,008
I am Kadiresan
What do you want, sir?

988
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:26,216
I want a job in the Railways

989
01:04:26,258 --> 01:04:27,320
Can you get me?

990
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,734
You've got a courier

991
01:04:28,775 --> 01:04:30,275
Sign here and take it

992
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,942
Who could have sent this to me?

993
01:04:33,984 --> 01:04:36,067
As if his father's name
is wrong on his ID card...

994
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,400
...he is staring at it fishily

995
01:04:37,484 --> 01:04:38,859
Where is S.V.Luggage shop?

996
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:40,067
Near that signal

997
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,150
Sir, where are you going?

998
01:04:44,192 --> 01:04:46,567
Can't you hear
the child crying?

999
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,400
Let me take a look
I'll be back

1000
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:50,775
One look at you, the child
may cry even more

1001
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:55,859
If any customer walks in
instead of staring at him lazily...

1002
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,067
...catch hold of him

1003
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:59,775
Is he water from a tap
that I catch a bucketful?

1004
01:05:03,902 --> 01:05:05,735
What kind of dreadful
livelihood is thi-

1005
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,700
Sir, did any courier boy
come in here?

1006
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:21,384
Only the Bhai who spreads
incense will walk in soon

1007
01:05:21,467 --> 01:05:22,717
You want smoke
on your face?

1008
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,175
Why are you getting angry, sir?

1009
01:05:24,217 --> 01:05:26,092
All I asked was
if a courier boy came here?

1010
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:28,175
I am allergic to
couriers and arrears

1011
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:30,217
You've come into
a shop selling bags

1012
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,342
Want to buy a bag?

1013
01:05:31,384 --> 01:05:32,800
You buy this
I can give this free

1014
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:33,509
No need

1015
01:05:33,592 --> 01:05:34,800
Then out you go

1016
01:05:38,424 --> 01:05:39,382
Is he there?

1017
01:05:39,424 --> 01:05:40,090
Not yet, sir

1018
01:05:41,424 --> 02:11:22,124
He hasn't come here as yet

1019
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,597
I'll wait here
and tackle him

1020
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:57,165
Don't cry, my precious

1021
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:58,665
Hello again, sir

1022
01:05:58,749 --> 01:06:02,582
Why are you disturbing
your grandpa while at work?

1023
01:06:02,665 --> 01:06:03,582
Grandpa?!

1024
01:06:03,665 --> 01:06:04,624
She's my daughter

1025
01:06:04,665 --> 01:06:06,999
If you tell her when she grows up
even she won't buy it!

1026
01:06:07,082 --> 01:06:08,499
Sign here

1027
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,415
Take care of
your granddaughter

1028
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:30,665
Darling, want lollipop
or an ice cream?

1029
01:06:30,665 --> 01:06:32,415
Sir, where is the owner?

1030
01:06:32,457 --> 01:06:34,749
I'm the owner of this shop
for the past 20 years

1031
01:06:34,832 --> 01:06:36,207
Then the man sitting here?

1032
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:37,915
He's a stupid courier boy

1033
01:06:37,957 --> 01:06:39,665
What?

1034
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:45,207
How did he escape!

1035
01:06:48,165 --> 01:06:50,040
Sir, I just missed him

1036
01:06:50,082 --> 01:06:51,290
What the 'ef' were you doing?

1037
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:53,082
Do you know how
important that cover is?

1038
01:06:53,165 --> 01:06:54,124
What's his bike number?

1039
01:06:54,207 --> 01:06:55,415
I didn't see the number, sir

1040
01:06:55,457 --> 01:06:56,749
But he was in a green shirt

1041
01:06:56,832 --> 01:06:58,040
Which side did he go?

1042
01:06:58,082 --> 01:06:58,915
Don't know exactly

1043
01:06:58,999 --> 01:07:00,499
But he went towards
Loyola college

1044
01:07:00,582 --> 01:07:01,665
Turn...turn

1045
01:07:01,707 --> 01:07:02,957
Go to Loyola college

1046
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:03,999
Shucks

1047
01:07:04,082 --> 01:07:05,790
Hurry...hurry up

1048
01:07:08,707 --> 01:07:10,499
So bloody important
And he screwed up

1049
01:07:10,582 --> 01:07:11,957
Hey! Watch it

1050
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,582
Black Splendor?

1051
01:07:18,665 --> 01:07:19,999
Green shirt

1052
01:07:20,165 --> 01:07:21,415
Turn...turn the car

1053
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:23,165
He is the one...turn

1054
01:07:23,624 --> 01:07:25,082
Wait...stop...stop

1055
01:07:25,165 --> 01:07:27,082
Don't know where
he turned now

1056
01:07:41,582 --> 01:07:42,915
Isn't he just pressing a shirt?

1057
01:07:42,999 --> 01:07:47,332
He's making sounds like he is
pressing heroine Samantha's back?

1058
01:07:48,707 --> 01:07:50,957
Who is 'rotten tooth Sekar' here?

1059
01:07:52,707 --> 01:07:53,874
Close your mouth

1060
01:07:53,957 --> 01:07:56,749
You're showing me ID proof as if
you're applying for a passport?

1061
01:07:56,832 --> 01:07:57,915
You've got a courier

1062
01:07:57,999 --> 01:07:59,332
Please read it out to me, bro

1063
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:01,957
Pancake face!
I am up to my neck in work

1064
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,332
Don't get angry

1065
01:08:03,415 --> 01:08:06,790
You should only get angry
because I called you 'pancake face'

1066
01:08:07,457 --> 01:08:09,665
I don't know to read

1067
01:08:09,665 --> 01:08:13,374
Did I stop you from studying
and force you to iron shirts?

1068
01:08:13,457 --> 01:08:16,457
Please read it out to me

1069
01:08:18,415 --> 01:08:21,290
You're as honest as
King Harischandra

1070
01:08:21,374 --> 01:08:24,165
You're as brave as
Netaji Subash Chandrabose

1071
01:08:24,249 --> 01:08:28,290
In being united you are
like Nelson Mandel-

1072
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:32,665
Eyes are donated
after one is dead

1073
01:08:32,707 --> 01:08:34,790
But even when alive...

1074
01:08:34,874 --> 01:08:38,165
...you've asked many hospitals
if your kidney or liver is needed

1075
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:41,457
I have never met
a good-hearted soul like you

1076
01:08:42,707 --> 01:08:44,040
In a nutshell...

1077
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:45,707
...you are Annadurai
in intelligence

1078
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:47,790
To shower mercy
on the depressed...

1079
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,790
...you're Mother Teresa

1080
01:08:52,832 --> 01:08:54,790
Not even lending an ear
to all this praise...

1081
01:08:54,874 --> 01:08:57,165
...you're busy pressing that skirt

1082
01:08:57,415 --> 01:08:58,915
May I know your name?

1083
01:08:58,999 --> 01:09:00,624
Who wrote this letter to you?

1084
01:09:00,665 --> 01:09:03,332
It's 110 degrees thanks to
the sun scorching overhead

1085
01:09:03,415 --> 01:09:06,165
I'm holding in my hand
150 degrees heat

1086
01:09:06,457 --> 01:09:10,999
Pressing and folding
again and again is my job

1087
01:09:11,665 --> 01:09:14,582
You've delivered covers
to so many people

1088
01:09:14,665 --> 01:09:17,665
Have you ever delivered
a package to anyone like me?

1089
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:19,874
Only if someone sends you
can I deliver it to you

1090
01:09:19,957 --> 01:09:21,832
If you wear a new shirt...

1091
01:09:21,915 --> 01:09:24,290
...people only ask
'where did you buy this?'

1092
01:09:24,374 --> 01:09:26,582
Do they ask
'who ironed it?'

1093
01:09:26,665 --> 01:09:28,415
Lunatic!

1094
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:31,415
I am stuck in this kind
of monotonous routine

1095
01:09:31,582 --> 01:09:33,040
Don't I need an entertainment?

1096
01:09:33,082 --> 01:09:36,665
That's why I sent
this letter to myself, sir

1097
01:09:36,749 --> 01:09:38,582
Don't I need
some relaxation?

1098
01:09:38,624 --> 01:09:41,624
Hey! Even the director who
made 'Bahubali' did not relax

1099
01:09:41,665 --> 01:09:43,290
He has started filming its sequel

1100
01:09:43,374 --> 01:09:46,582
Why do you need to relax
when you just iron clothes?

1101
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:51,374
How come you are
back home so early?

1102
01:09:51,415 --> 01:09:53,165
I need to meet
someone very important

1103
01:09:53,207 --> 01:09:54,457
I thought I can
freshen up

1104
01:09:54,499 --> 01:09:55,665
Who is it?
For what?

1105
01:09:55,749 --> 01:09:57,915
If it is okayed, you'll be
the 1st person I will tell

1106
01:09:57,999 --> 01:09:58,832
Did you eat?

1107
01:09:58,915 --> 01:10:00,665
I have no appetite

1108
01:10:00,749 --> 01:10:01,624
I feel very tired

1109
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:03,999
Did you take the pills
the doctor prescribed?

1110
01:10:04,082 --> 01:10:04,790
No

1111
01:10:04,874 --> 01:10:06,290
How can you be so careless?

1112
01:10:06,374 --> 01:10:07,374
Where is it?

1113
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:29,624
He asked me to take this
after dinner, not now

1114
01:10:29,665 --> 01:10:30,999
Keep coming up with excuses

1115
01:10:31,082 --> 01:10:32,332
You'll take care of everyone

1116
01:10:32,374 --> 01:10:33,582
And neglect your own needs

1117
01:10:33,624 --> 01:10:36,415
Take it later, I'll keep it near
this photo of your favourite God

1118
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:40,249
I need to go urgently

1119
01:10:40,749 --> 01:10:41,874
There he is

1120
01:10:47,415 --> 01:10:48,332
He whizzed past

1121
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:49,624
One more chance

1122
01:10:49,665 --> 01:10:51,415
Sir, please stop

1123
01:10:54,332 --> 01:10:55,249
You'll get hurt

1124
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:56,207
I have to go urgently

1125
01:10:56,249 --> 01:10:57,332
I am head deep in work

1126
01:10:57,415 --> 01:10:59,832
If you don't give me a lift
I'll lose my head, sir

1127
01:10:59,915 --> 01:11:00,915
I beg of you

1128
01:11:00,999 --> 01:11:02,082
Okay, sit

1129
01:11:02,874 --> 01:11:04,124
Sat...?

1130
01:11:04,249 --> 01:11:05,415
Go fast, sir

1131
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:07,374
What's the urgent mission?

1132
01:11:07,457 --> 01:11:09,124
Is your wife
giving birth to a baby?

1133
01:11:09,207 --> 01:11:10,290
Nothing like that, sir

1134
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,415
Any problem, you want
to go to the police station?

1135
01:11:12,457 --> 01:11:15,665
Only because of a few
good souls like you in town

1136
01:11:15,749 --> 01:11:17,124
...bars sell cool beer

1137
01:11:17,165 --> 01:11:19,249
But as per the proverb
'it rains' not bar and beer

1138
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:21,540
Both rain and beer contain
water that we drink

1139
01:11:21,624 --> 01:11:24,040
Gutter also has water
Will you drink that?

1140
01:11:24,124 --> 01:11:25,665
Where do you
want to go now?

1141
01:11:25,832 --> 01:11:27,374
Sir...stop...stop

1142
01:11:27,457 --> 01:11:29,082
Don't be in a rush

1143
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,790
Wait and watch

1144
01:11:31,874 --> 01:11:33,999
Couch potato!

1145
01:11:34,082 --> 01:11:35,457
Is he a friend of yours?

1146
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,290
No, sir

1147
01:11:36,374 --> 01:11:37,665
He refused to
give me a lift

1148
01:11:37,749 --> 01:11:38,665
Bloody scumbag

1149
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:39,957
But I gave you a lift

1150
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,207
- So why fight?
- Wait, sir

1151
01:11:41,249 --> 01:11:43,415
It's a dowry-gift, right?

1152
01:11:43,457 --> 01:11:45,249
Will you wear out
if you give me a lift?

1153
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:47,332
Hey! Come, I have
tonnes of work to do

1154
01:11:47,415 --> 01:11:50,124
Tea for neglecting me, huh?
He and his deadpan look!

1155
01:11:50,165 --> 01:11:51,749
You poured boiling
hot tea on him

1156
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:52,957
He's boiling mad
Let's go

1157
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,832
Sir immediately obliged
when I asked for a lift

1158
01:11:55,915 --> 01:11:57,124
You bloody broomstick!

1159
01:11:57,249 --> 01:11:59,165
Drink his piss to
become as noble as him!

1160
01:11:59,249 --> 01:12:00,790
Why drag me
into your fight?

1161
01:12:00,874 --> 01:12:01,874
Only then he will reform

1162
01:12:01,957 --> 01:12:03,082
Just shut up and come

1163
01:12:03,165 --> 01:12:05,915
Why does this rhino
need coolers?

1164
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,374
You're a gentleman

1165
01:12:09,624 --> 01:12:11,915
Why is the cannon
turning my way?

1166
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:17,832
If you're jobless go and
sleep whole day through

1167
01:12:17,915 --> 01:12:20,415
Don't offer lifts
to such lazy louts

1168
01:12:21,499 --> 01:12:24,332
Will you ever offer a lift
to anyone else in your life?

1169
01:12:26,249 --> 01:12:28,957
I won't ask for a lift either

1170
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,124
Thank you, sir

1171
01:12:36,249 --> 01:12:37,874
He had the gall to hit you

1172
01:12:37,915 --> 01:12:38,999
Let's go and nab him

1173
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,749
You want us now to be
bruised black and blue by him?

1174
01:12:41,832 --> 01:12:44,457
Rotten 'roti' face!
I have work up to my neck

1175
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,290
Where did you want
to go in such a hurry?

1176
01:12:46,332 --> 01:12:47,540
To the wine shop, sir

1177
01:12:47,582 --> 01:12:50,207
Only if I go in the morning
and drink a cool beer...

1178
01:12:50,249 --> 01:12:51,624
...my hand will stop shaking!

1179
01:12:51,665 --> 01:12:53,165
If you ride a bike yourself...

1180
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:55,082
...the police will nab you
for drunken diving

1181
01:12:55,165 --> 01:12:57,457
So you're a stray dog
who thumbs for a lift?

1182
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,582
All this in between is
for entertainment value

1183
01:12:59,624 --> 01:13:01,249
Are you still waiting
to ride pillion?!

1184
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:02,540
You deserve to be-

1185
01:13:03,249 --> 01:13:05,832
You said a prospective groom
was coming to see you today

1186
01:13:05,874 --> 01:13:07,249
And you're still sitting here

1187
01:13:07,332 --> 01:13:09,624
He said he would
meet me here

1188
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:11,249
You've advanced
leaps and bounds!

1189
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:13,624
Not bad, I thought you were
a regular stick in the mud

1190
01:13:13,665 --> 01:13:14,957
But how can I not know him?

1191
01:13:14,999 --> 01:13:17,665
Is it your neighbor who was
falling all over you?

1192
01:13:18,374 --> 01:13:21,665
One of your cousins who was
drooling around you all the time?

1193
01:13:21,749 --> 01:13:24,040
I tied a 'rakhi' 5 years ago
accepting him as my bro

1194
01:13:24,124 --> 01:13:25,415
Enough of this suspense

1195
01:13:25,499 --> 01:13:27,249
Where did you meet him?

1196
01:13:27,415 --> 01:13:29,832
The 1st time I met him...

1197
01:13:30,582 --> 01:13:33,999
'...he came to hand me a courier'

1198
01:13:34,624 --> 01:13:36,332
'There was some spark in him'

1199
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:39,957
'I don't know why'

1200
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,874
'I flipped for him
from day one'

1201
01:13:43,832 --> 01:13:46,915
'From then on he started
following me like a lost pup'

1202
01:13:47,249 --> 01:13:49,665
'I thought he was also
like all other guys'

1203
01:13:50,082 --> 01:13:51,665
'But I was wrong'

1204
01:13:52,249 --> 01:13:54,374
'Imagine how special
I must have been to him'

1205
01:13:54,457 --> 01:13:58,207
'Just to see me daily
he took up this courier job'

1206
01:13:58,249 --> 01:14:00,624
'And gave me covers
to impress me'

1207
01:14:00,665 --> 01:14:04,540
'I knew right then he was the one
sending all those covers to me'

1208
01:14:06,249 --> 01:14:08,665
You know when I fell for him?

1209
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:11,374
'When the fire accident
was somewhere else...'

1210
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:13,957
'...he thought the shop
I work in was ablaze'

1211
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,332
'He was so flustered
I might have been hurt'

1212
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:18,415
'You should have seen
the scene he made'

1213
01:14:18,499 --> 01:14:22,499
'Only that day his eyes
showed me the depth of his love'

1214
01:14:23,124 --> 01:14:27,624
From that day on I started
reciprocating his love

1215
01:14:28,374 --> 01:14:32,374
'To find out if I love him
he played a trick on me'

1216
01:14:32,499 --> 01:14:34,624
'I turned the tables on him'

1217
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:36,790
'But when I told him
I am committed...'

1218
01:14:36,874 --> 01:14:38,040
'...I meant only him'

1219
01:14:38,124 --> 01:14:40,832
'I knew very well
he also meant only me'

1220
01:14:40,915 --> 01:14:41,999
Poor thing!

1221
01:14:42,082 --> 01:14:44,374
Why do you torment him
when you know he loves you?

1222
01:14:44,457 --> 01:14:47,665
If not your lover,
who else can you torment?!

1223
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:51,457
Whatever you may say
he must have felt terrible

1224
01:14:52,124 --> 01:14:55,499
Even before I got the newspaper
in the morning, I got his love letter

1225
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,915
He said outright
'I love you, Kavya'

1226
01:14:58,207 --> 01:15:00,207
'My mom barged into
my room all of a sudden'

1227
01:15:00,249 --> 01:15:01,665
'I didn't know how to react'

1228
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:03,665
What, ma?

1229
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,415
I'm going to the temple with
your father, food is on the table

1230
01:15:06,457 --> 01:15:07,749
Eat when you're hungry

1231
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,749
'I'll be waiting for you
at the coffee cafe tomorrow'

1232
01:15:14,832 --> 01:15:16,249
'If you don't come-'

1233
01:15:16,332 --> 01:15:17,832
'Be there, Kavya, please'

1234
01:15:17,915 --> 01:15:19,915
I'm anyway meeting
the man I'll marry

1235
01:15:19,999 --> 01:15:23,040
That's why got the day off
saying 'prospective groom'

1236
01:15:23,249 --> 01:15:24,332
What a schemer!

1237
01:15:24,374 --> 01:15:26,165
I thought you were
this naive babe

1238
01:15:26,249 --> 01:15:27,290
Very astute

1239
01:15:27,832 --> 01:15:30,540
Before the hero flips
the heroine fell flat, huh?

1240
01:15:39,082 --> 01:15:40,582
Have you left?

1241
01:15:40,665 --> 01:15:42,040
We are all here in court

1242
01:15:42,082 --> 01:15:43,290
Even the judge has come

1243
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:44,665
I'm coming there

1244
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,624
I'll give the covers to
Kodhandam to deliver

1245
01:15:46,665 --> 01:15:47,790
Don't delay, come soon

1246
01:15:47,874 --> 01:15:49,082
Okay, I'll be there

1247
01:15:54,374 --> 01:15:55,040
Tell me

1248
01:15:55,124 --> 01:15:56,999
Kodhandam, I have to go to court

1249
01:15:57,082 --> 01:15:58,332
Collect the covers from me

1250
01:15:58,374 --> 01:16:00,665
I'm stuck in a situation
where I cannot come

1251
01:16:00,749 --> 01:16:01,999
My load is too much

1252
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,665
Tell someone else please

1253
01:16:03,749 --> 01:16:05,374
Sorry, don't get me wrong

1254
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:20,249
Hello, tell me

1255
01:16:20,332 --> 01:16:23,040
I have to go to court as witness

1256
01:16:23,124 --> 01:16:25,290
Kodhandam ditched me
in the last minute

1257
01:16:25,374 --> 01:16:27,040
Please deliver
the covers for me

1258
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:27,790
No chance

1259
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:29,957
You know where I'm going
and how important it is

1260
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,332
I know, but just this once
For my sake

1261
01:16:32,415 --> 01:16:33,624
Only 1 cover

1262
01:16:33,665 --> 01:16:35,915
The rest I can deliver
on the way to court

1263
01:16:40,999 --> 01:16:43,457
Bro! Why did you stop there?
U-turn and come around

1264
01:16:43,499 --> 01:16:47,165
No way! I have to
ride a mile for that

1265
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:50,457
For a hot babe, you will
ride all around town jobless

1266
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:53,082
For a friend, you won't
even go a mile, huh?!

1267
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:54,582
Shut up!

1268
01:16:54,665 --> 01:16:56,124
No time for all that now

1269
01:16:56,165 --> 01:16:59,082
I'll wait here only till he packs
the bouquet for Kavya

1270
01:16:59,124 --> 01:17:00,874
Listen to this pearl of wisdom

1271
01:17:00,874 --> 01:17:02,249
The eyes you donate

1272
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:03,957
And love that a girl doesn't validate...

1273
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:05,707
...can belong to
anyone any day

1274
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:08,499
- What's your bloody problem?
- Why get so stressed?

1275
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,915
'No Entry' sign
doesn't apply to me

1276
01:17:10,957 --> 01:17:12,582
If you give me 100 bucks...

1277
01:17:12,624 --> 01:17:14,457
...I can dash over
in lightning speed

1278
01:17:14,499 --> 01:17:15,874
You snail nosed fellow!

1279
01:17:15,874 --> 01:17:17,915
Won't cost me that much
to go up to even Erode

1280
01:17:17,957 --> 01:17:19,624
You want 100 bucks
to cross the road?

1281
01:17:19,707 --> 01:17:20,540
Clear off!

1282
01:17:20,749 --> 01:17:22,040
Your call then

1283
01:17:22,082 --> 01:17:24,915
That florist will
be done in 2 minutes

1284
01:17:25,082 --> 01:17:26,207
What, da?

1285
01:17:26,249 --> 01:17:27,207
How much longer?

1286
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:28,582
Wait, I say

1287
01:17:29,124 --> 01:17:30,707
You donut-head!

1288
01:17:30,749 --> 01:17:33,290
Lady Luck is flashing
her teeth at you today

1289
01:17:33,374 --> 01:17:35,374
Here's 20 bucks

1290
01:17:36,915 --> 01:17:39,915
Hand this cover
to him safely

1291
01:17:39,957 --> 01:17:40,874
Go

1292
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:42,624
Why are you staring
blankly at me?

1293
01:17:42,665 --> 01:17:43,749
Cross the road carefully

1294
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:46,290
Mistaking you for a pumpkin
used to de-spell on New moon...

1295
01:17:46,415 --> 01:17:49,082
...a lorry driver might
run over you, hurry up

1296
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,165
Sir that's him!

1297
01:17:54,665 --> 01:17:55,707
Follow me

1298
01:17:55,874 --> 01:17:57,749
Sir, I'm a cripple
Please stop

1299
01:18:00,624 --> 01:18:03,749
Why are you moving slower
than a trash-loading lorry?

1300
01:18:03,874 --> 01:18:05,624
Your 20 bucks
gets only this speed

1301
01:18:05,707 --> 01:18:07,415
100 bucks
Just as you asked

1302
01:18:07,457 --> 01:18:08,415
Now move faster

1303
01:18:08,457 --> 01:18:09,999
100 bucks

1304
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:11,749
Stop...stop

1305
01:18:12,082 --> 01:18:13,124
Stop the car

1306
01:18:13,207 --> 01:18:14,374
Wait...wait

1307
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,707
100 bucks!

1308
01:18:17,832 --> 01:18:19,374
Con-man of the year!

1309
01:18:19,457 --> 01:18:20,832
Stop

1310
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,874
Here you are, sir

1311
01:18:29,707 --> 01:18:32,082
We've been looking
for you all day

1312
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,790
Went all the way
to your office too

1313
01:18:33,874 --> 01:18:35,374
You have the cover I sent

1314
01:18:35,415 --> 01:18:36,540
I have ID proof with me

1315
01:18:36,582 --> 01:18:37,874
Please hand me the cover

1316
01:18:37,874 --> 01:18:40,457
Does your brain spark into
action only 3 hours later?

1317
01:18:40,499 --> 01:18:41,832
Unnecessarily courier a cover

1318
01:18:41,874 --> 01:18:43,415
And then come rushing to retrieve it

1319
01:18:43,457 --> 01:18:45,207
- What's his name?
- Sathyamurthy, sir

1320
01:18:45,249 --> 01:18:46,374
Chetpet

1321
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:48,040
Yes, that's the one

1322
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:50,582
Oh no! I just asked
my friend to deliver it

1323
01:18:50,624 --> 01:18:52,790
Whom did you give it to?
Which side did he go?

1324
01:18:52,874 --> 01:18:53,624
He just left

1325
01:18:53,665 --> 01:18:55,957
Don't worry
It will reach safe

1326
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,040
Sir...sir...wait

1327
01:18:58,707 --> 01:18:59,832
Dammit!

1328
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:03,957
What happened?

1329
01:19:03,999 --> 01:19:05,124
We found the courier boy

1330
01:19:05,165 --> 01:19:06,832
But he handed it over to his friend!

1331
01:19:06,874 --> 01:19:08,915
He left before we could
find out who the friend is

1332
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:10,832
He says it may
have been delivered

1333
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,749
Whoever has the cover...

1334
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,124
...it will be delivered only
at Sathyamurthy's house

1335
01:19:18,165 --> 01:19:19,915
Or it should have already reached

1336
01:19:20,874 --> 01:19:22,124
'Listen to me'

1337
01:19:22,207 --> 01:19:24,165
'Sathyamurthy is a follower
of Gandhi's ideals'

1338
01:19:24,249 --> 01:19:26,665
'So he won't like
this security business'

1339
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:29,374
- Who do you want to see?
- Mr Sathyamurthy

1340
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:32,915
'Make 2 of our boys
wait downstairs'

1341
01:19:32,999 --> 01:19:35,165
'Go up and talk
to him directly'

1342
01:19:35,249 --> 01:19:38,165
'Whatever your problem,
come and meet me'

1343
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:40,999
'He says this in every meeting
like a broken record'

1344
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:48,874
Good morning, sir

1345
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:51,040
We need to talk to you

1346
01:19:52,707 --> 01:19:55,040
We are from the Lions club of Tirunelveli

1347
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:57,832
There is a chemical
factory in our town

1348
01:19:57,874 --> 01:20:00,457
They are mixing
their waste in our water

1349
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:04,290
We use that polluted water to
drink, cook, for everything, sir

1350
01:20:12,499 --> 01:20:13,874
Hello, who is this?

1351
01:20:13,874 --> 01:20:16,790
We tried contacting the factory owner,
but didn't get any response

1352
01:20:16,832 --> 01:20:18,749
We then filed a police complaint

1353
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:25,290
No action was taken
Only you can help us

1354
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:35,582
How long has it been
since you filed the complaint?

1355
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:39,582
And what did you say
was the collector's name?

1356
01:20:39,665 --> 01:20:40,957
Well! His name is-

1357
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:47,249
-Yes?
- Sir...you?

1358
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:49,749
Wow! I am such a big fan of yours

1359
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:51,624
Daily I watch you on TV

1360
01:20:51,874 --> 01:20:53,582
I have a courier for you

1361
01:20:54,415 --> 01:20:55,540
Here, sir

1362
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:59,415
Even last week, you were
in a protest, fasting at the beach

1363
01:20:59,499 --> 01:21:01,290
I was passing by that way

1364
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:22,874
Same way in 2010 also, in Tirupur
they created a huge problem

1365
01:21:23,207 --> 01:21:26,249
We protested to
the best of our ability

1366
01:21:26,957 --> 01:21:28,707
We didn't get any
favorable result

1367
01:21:28,749 --> 01:21:30,707
As usual they used
political clout

1368
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,082
Sir, could I have
some water please?

1369
01:22:12,915 --> 01:22:14,207
You-

1370
01:22:22,582 --> 01:22:23,499
Who are you?

1371
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,040
Why did you try
to steal my cover?

1372
01:22:25,124 --> 01:22:26,499
Where are you from?

1373
01:22:29,582 --> 01:22:31,290
What are you doing?

1374
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,249
Let go of me

1375
01:22:38,499 --> 01:22:41,249
Hey! That courier chap is back

1376
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,957
I'll see what he wants

1377
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:45,415
Let go of me

1378
01:22:48,624 --> 01:22:49,874
Can I help you?

1379
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:52,249
Sir...isn't sir there?

1380
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:54,124
He is busy in a meeting
What do you want?

1381
01:22:54,207 --> 01:22:56,457
He forgot to return my pen

1382
01:22:56,499 --> 01:22:59,165
If all you want is a pen,
then take mine and leave

1383
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:01,499
No, I want my own pen back

1384
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:02,999
It's okay, take this

1385
01:23:03,082 --> 01:23:05,749
My girlfriend gifted it to me
I want only that pen

1386
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:08,832
Won't you understand?
Take this and go now

1387
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:12,207
You're the one not understanding
the love behind this gift

1388
01:23:12,249 --> 01:23:13,999
I can't even start
my bike without it

1389
01:23:14,082 --> 01:23:16,249
Don't keep harping
on a pen, get lost!

1390
01:23:17,624 --> 01:23:20,290
Why are you shoving me away
when I'm talking to you politely?

1391
01:23:20,415 --> 01:23:22,999
You go if you want
I will wait and collect it

1392
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,915
You can't wait
Leave right now

1393
01:23:28,582 --> 01:23:31,374
I didn't mean to push you
But you kept badgerin-

1394
01:23:43,457 --> 01:23:44,582
Let go of me

1395
01:23:46,624 --> 01:23:47,790
Take the cover and run

1396
01:23:47,832 --> 01:23:49,082
Don't worry about me

1397
01:23:49,165 --> 01:23:49,874
Go

1398
01:23:49,915 --> 01:23:51,290
Don't just stand there and stare

1399
01:23:51,374 --> 01:23:52,582
GO

1400
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:01,499
What the heck are you doing?

1401
01:24:01,582 --> 01:24:03,415
He's already up here
Come up, quick

1402
01:24:03,457 --> 01:24:04,957
He's upstairs it seems

1403
01:24:14,457 --> 01:24:15,665
Nab him

1404
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,207
Dammit!

1405
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:42,707
He escaped through an alley

1406
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:44,499
Get on your bikes and find him

1407
01:25:40,749 --> 01:25:42,457
We missed him

1408
01:26:09,124 --> 01:26:11,165
Go...go, as fast as you can

1409
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:13,124
Hey you...stop

1410
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,749
Get him

1411
01:26:44,665 --> 01:26:45,874
He's getting away

1412
01:26:45,874 --> 01:26:46,915
Catch him

1413
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:52,249
His phone seems
to be switched off

1414
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:52,999
Is that so?

1415
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,624
Why don't you try
calling the shop?

1416
01:26:54,665 --> 01:26:55,457
I already did

1417
01:26:55,499 --> 01:26:56,874
No sign of him there either

1418
01:26:56,915 --> 01:26:58,915
Manikandan, who couriered
the cover to you...

1419
01:26:58,999 --> 01:27:02,540
...works as a ward boy,
in a private hospital in Salem

1420
01:27:02,749 --> 01:27:05,165
I checked with
the courier office

1421
01:27:05,582 --> 01:27:09,665
The envelope only contained
prescriptions and samples

1422
01:27:09,749 --> 01:27:12,624
No...no, I don't buy that

1423
01:27:12,874 --> 01:27:16,082
For a mere prescription why would
thugs barge into my house...

1424
01:27:16,165 --> 01:27:17,915
...threaten and beat me up?

1425
01:27:18,374 --> 01:27:21,165
Thankfully that courier chap landed
at my doorstep at the right time

1426
01:27:21,207 --> 01:27:22,707
God only knows
if he's safe now

1427
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:25,749
To nab the gang and
save the courier boy...

1428
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:28,415
...the police are patrolling
all over the city

1429
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:34,207
Hey! That's him

1430
01:28:33,999 --> 01:28:34,999
Check that side

1431
01:28:35,082 --> 01:28:36,540
You come over here

1432
01:28:36,749 --> 01:28:37,707
Shucks!

1433
01:28:49,999 --> 01:28:50,999
Hello, who's this?

1434
01:28:51,082 --> 01:28:52,124
Can I talk to Manikandan?

1435
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:52,915
You are...?

1436
01:28:52,999 --> 01:28:56,790
It's urgent, I need to speak
with him about a courier he sent

1437
01:28:56,874 --> 01:28:59,874
He passed away
in an accident today, sir

1438
01:28:59,999 --> 01:29:03,749
Tragic, a hit and run case
by a speeding van, sir

1439
01:29:03,999 --> 01:29:05,707
He is dead...?

1440
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:07,082
I'll take care of the courier

1441
01:29:07,165 --> 01:29:09,665
I want Manikandan
who sent this courier killed

1442
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,665
He has no chance
of escaping now

1443
01:30:22,749 --> 01:30:24,165
Take immediate action

1444
01:30:27,082 --> 01:30:28,374
What is going on here?

1445
01:30:28,415 --> 01:30:30,582
The one who couriered
the cover to me is not alive

1446
01:30:30,624 --> 01:30:33,415
They barged into my house and
hit me because it was sent to me

1447
01:30:33,415 --> 01:30:36,415
I'm only concerned about
the courier who has that cover

1448
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:37,874
I'm worried about his safety

1449
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:04,040
There's no way
he can leave the mall

1450
01:31:04,082 --> 01:31:05,207
Search

1451
01:31:40,082 --> 01:31:41,374
He tricked and confused us

1452
01:31:41,415 --> 01:31:42,374
This is his handiwork

1453
01:31:42,415 --> 01:31:44,290
He has escaped
from the parking lot

1454
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,540
Nab him at the exit now

1455
01:31:48,582 --> 01:31:50,415
Thorough patrolling is going on

1456
01:31:50,415 --> 01:31:51,374
I'll handle it, sir

1457
01:31:51,415 --> 01:31:53,249
Sir, I don't know them
They are chasing me

1458
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:54,999
This is a courier for
Mr Sathyamurthy, sir

1459
01:31:55,082 --> 01:31:55,915
But they beat him up

1460
01:31:55,957 --> 01:31:57,374
Are you that courier?

1461
01:31:57,415 --> 01:31:59,415
I've been looking for you
Hope you aren't hurt

1462
01:31:59,457 --> 01:32:00,832
- I'm fine
- Get in

1463
01:32:00,915 --> 01:32:03,082
The man who sent
the courier is dead it seems

1464
01:32:03,165 --> 01:32:05,749
Please contact Sathyamurthy sir
and inform him immediately

1465
01:32:07,332 --> 01:32:08,915
I don't know
what happened

1466
01:32:10,415 --> 01:32:12,457
Okay, let's go

1467
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:14,790
If delayed he'll usually call me

1468
01:32:14,915 --> 01:32:17,540
I called him a couple of times
and his phone is switched off

1469
01:32:17,624 --> 01:32:19,790
If a girl's phone
is not reachable...

1470
01:32:19,832 --> 01:32:21,665
...means she's ditching her boyfriend

1471
01:32:21,707 --> 01:32:24,124
But if a guy's phone
is not reachable...

1472
01:32:24,165 --> 01:32:27,082
...means he's with a girl
having a gala time!

1473
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:28,374
What are you hinting at?

1474
01:32:28,415 --> 01:32:30,415
I thought he was busy
delivering a courier

1475
01:32:30,457 --> 01:32:32,707
That's what you think

1476
01:32:32,749 --> 01:32:35,582
But he's working on sending
a girl to deliver a baby soon

1477
01:32:35,624 --> 01:32:37,999
Oh! So this was
his important job

1478
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,624
I'll give him
a solid piece of my mind

1479
01:32:39,707 --> 01:32:42,165
Don't use your gray cells
as to how to advance in life

1480
01:32:42,207 --> 01:32:45,207
But in this matter alone
be sooooper advanced

1481
01:32:45,499 --> 01:32:47,582
If you're a big shot
you should advice, right?

1482
01:32:47,624 --> 01:32:49,374
My advice may seem bitter to you

1483
01:32:49,415 --> 01:32:51,499
If it is bitter, I can
add honey and lick it up

1484
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,082
You go back to
cutting apples

1485
01:32:53,124 --> 01:32:54,790
You'll never reform

1486
01:33:14,749 --> 01:33:18,332
Sir, I have both the courier
and the courier boy in my custody

1487
01:33:18,415 --> 01:33:21,040
'He sought help from the officer
on patrol of his own accord'

1488
01:33:21,124 --> 01:33:23,290
'He just handed him
over to me now'

1489
01:33:37,124 --> 01:33:39,374
After all a courier boy!

1490
01:33:42,374 --> 01:33:43,290
I will-

1491
01:33:43,332 --> 01:33:45,415
Sir, leave him to me

1492
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:47,582
Here is your cover

1493
01:34:02,499 --> 01:34:03,999
He has switched the covers

1494
01:34:04,082 --> 01:34:05,124
Oh gawd!

1495
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:07,999
Quick...get him
before he escapes

1496
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:14,415
I will hand him over to you at
the designated place in 10 minutes

1497
01:34:14,457 --> 01:34:16,207
Since it is linked
to Sathyamurthy sir...

1498
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:17,665
...I've taken a lot of risks

1499
01:34:17,707 --> 01:34:19,040
Please do the needful, sir

1500
01:35:35,332 --> 01:35:36,290
Lost him

1501
01:35:36,332 --> 01:35:37,374
Look that side

1502
01:35:37,457 --> 01:35:39,249
Come fast

1503
01:35:59,582 --> 01:36:00,832
'My name is Manikandan'

1504
01:36:00,915 --> 01:36:03,249
'I'm working in Lakshmi hospital
in Salem as a ward boy'

1505
01:36:03,332 --> 01:36:05,207
'There is great injustice
happening here, sir'

1506
01:36:05,249 --> 01:36:08,124
'The pregnant women fetuses
are being aborted deliberately here'

1507
01:36:08,165 --> 01:36:11,624
'I overheard Dr Surya Kumar
who works here talking to his group'

1508
01:36:11,707 --> 01:36:14,415
'In all the hospitals in
their network in Tamil Nadu...'

1509
01:36:14,457 --> 01:36:17,249
'...they were planning to abort
fetuses at the same time'

1510
01:36:17,332 --> 01:36:18,874
'I am just an ordinary ward boy'

1511
01:36:18,915 --> 01:36:20,332
'I can't fight their system'

1512
01:36:20,332 --> 01:36:24,165
'They can use their influence
on politicians and people in power'

1513
01:36:24,249 --> 01:36:26,082
'I am just an ordinary ward boy'

1514
01:37:13,749 --> 01:37:14,665
- Akka?
- Tamil?

1515
01:37:14,749 --> 01:37:15,915
Have you taken that tablet?

1516
01:37:15,957 --> 01:37:18,040
I'll take it after dinner
When will you be back?

1517
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:19,415
Listen, don't take that tablet

1518
01:37:19,499 --> 01:37:21,415
What do you mean?
What's wrong?

1519
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:26,582
Shame on you!

1520
01:38:26,665 --> 01:38:29,249
You want to kill a life
in the uterus for money-

1521
01:38:29,957 --> 01:38:33,332
So many people dream
of a child of their own

1522
01:38:33,499 --> 01:38:36,249
You've trampled
their dreams callously

1523
01:38:38,749 --> 01:38:41,582
After 12 years my sister
has conceived now

1524
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:44,290
You made me kill
her baby and dream

1525
01:38:49,457 --> 01:38:51,832
How many more like
my sister did you do this to?

1526
01:38:51,915 --> 01:38:53,624
What did they do
to deserve this?

1527
01:38:55,665 --> 01:38:57,332
I'll pay you whatever you want

1528
01:38:57,415 --> 01:38:58,624
Give that to me

1529
01:38:58,665 --> 01:39:01,665
After all that you've done
you have the gall to bribe me?

1530
01:39:27,582 --> 01:39:29,040
Who the hell are you?

1531
01:39:56,165 --> 01:39:58,165
He knows all our secrets, doctor

1532
01:39:58,207 --> 01:39:59,415
If he is alive, he will-

1533
01:41:35,332 --> 01:41:38,790
'A scam of epic proportions
at a private hospital in Salem...'

1534
01:41:38,832 --> 01:41:42,290
'...has been brought to light
by an ordinary courier boy'

1535
01:41:42,332 --> 01:41:46,249
'The doctors who forcibly aborted
the fetuses have been arrested'

1536
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:53,707
'The police department has assured
maximum jail term for the culprits'

1537
01:41:53,790 --> 01:41:56,999
'Dr Ramakrishnan who heads
the All India Medical Council...'

1538
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,124
'...has condemned this crime strongly'

1539
01:41:59,165 --> 01:42:02,207
Even if a pregnant woman
has a natural miscarriage...

1540
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:05,749
...the stem cells of the fetus
cannot be used for research

1541
01:42:05,832 --> 01:42:07,124
This is a ban world over

1542
01:42:07,207 --> 01:42:10,540
Stem cells in a fetus
is equal to a living being

1543
01:42:10,624 --> 01:42:14,999
Such being the case whether these
stem cells can be used for research...

1544
01:42:15,082 --> 01:42:18,790
...an ethical versus medical war
is being waged world over

1545
01:42:18,874 --> 01:42:20,874
When people believe
doctors to be Gods...

1546
01:42:20,915 --> 01:42:22,832
...if doctors themselves
commit such a crim-

1547
01:42:22,915 --> 01:42:24,999
Because of a handful of doctors...

1548
01:42:25,082 --> 01:42:29,249
...we should not condemn
the entire medical fraternity

1549
01:42:29,290 --> 01:42:32,999
A doctor's duty is to save lives
and abide by their oath always

1550
01:42:33,082 --> 01:42:40,207
Doctors selflessly world over
do their duty 365 days a year

1551
01:42:40,249 --> 01:42:43,540
'Regarding this barbaric scam
that shook Tamil Nadu...'

1552
01:42:43,624 --> 01:42:47,332
'...Mr Sathyamurthy, the social activist
has shared his opinion with our viewers'

1553
01:42:47,415 --> 01:42:51,165
If such a radical change can take place
thanks to a courier boy's diligence...

1554
01:42:51,207 --> 01:42:56,457
...imagine if our politicians performed
their duties without strings attached

1555
01:42:56,582 --> 01:42:59,332
...very soon our nation
will become a superpower

1556
01:42:59,415 --> 01:43:02,165
'To the courier boy who risked
his life to expose this scam...'

1557
01:43:02,249 --> 01:43:05,499
'...people have expressed
their gratitude and lauded him'

1558
01:43:05,582 --> 01:43:11,415
'Medical council has awarded
Rs 1 million to Tamilselvan'

1559
01:43:11,499 --> 01:43:15,707
'Tamil Nadu Govt. has also
acclaimed Tamil's brave act'

1560
01:43:24,582 --> 01:43:29,040
This money was awarded
to you for your brave deed

1561
01:43:29,082 --> 01:43:32,040
Even if not for you, take it
for your daughter's sake

1562
01:43:32,082 --> 01:43:33,999
Fulfil his dreams by
educating her well

1563
01:43:34,082 --> 01:43:36,707
Please accept it

1564
01:44:05,665 --> 01:44:09,040
Hey! How do you always call me
just when I'm thinking of you?

1565
01:44:09,082 --> 01:44:11,040
Before I accepted
your proposal...

1566
01:44:11,124 --> 01:44:14,165
...you'll be waiting outside with
a cover even before the shop opens

1567
01:44:14,249 --> 01:44:15,832
After I accepted your love...

1568
01:44:15,915 --> 01:44:18,707
...no sign of any courier
And the courier boy is also missing

1569
01:44:21,707 --> 01:44:22,957
You'll act funny now

1570
01:44:22,999 --> 01:44:24,415
Can you hear me?

1571
01:44:24,499 --> 01:44:25,832
I can hear very well

1572
01:44:25,915 --> 01:44:28,332
Because you have a junk of a phone...

1573
01:44:28,415 --> 01:44:31,540
...I've been shopping the last 1 hour
to get you the best phone available

1574
01:44:31,582 --> 01:44:34,124
And waiting in queue to pay
the bill for the past half hour

1575
01:44:34,165 --> 01:44:35,207
Looks like you think...

1576
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:37,707
...I'm lying in bed without
even having brushed my teeth!

1577
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:38,707
Don't act pricey

1578
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:40,582
If you're not here
in half an hour...

1579
01:44:40,624 --> 01:44:43,582
...you'll get 'khadi' material here
but definitely not Kavya!

1580
01:44:43,665 --> 01:44:46,582
As soon as I pay the bill
I'll be there in a jiffy, dear.
