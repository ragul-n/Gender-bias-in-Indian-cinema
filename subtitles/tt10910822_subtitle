1
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,666
Did all the items come?

2
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,583
Ok, careful

3
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,500
Ok, keep it inside

4
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:15,875
Hey, why did Chandraiah grandpa lift that and throw?
- He leaves gas in that sound

5
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,125
Why do you scold when I said green?

6
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,166
You rascal, here

7
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,250
When I asked for green, why are you giving a plant?
How do I tie it up? Give the green one

8
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,750
I’ll find out which is the green one from this

9
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,666
Why does he leave so when I said the green
- Green, green!

10
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,791
You put that cell phone aside and hold this

11
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,833
What dude, is the ice brought from our village factory?
- Yes from there

12
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,500
Hey, hold properly. It would break into pieces if it falls down

13
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,375
I caught it, dude
- It’s a torture to lift it up again

14
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,666
Slowly
- Come that side

15
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,500
What man, did you order for soda?

16
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,000
I’m going for the same, man

17
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,125
Brother, I forgot. Arrange to put pickle into these two

18
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,125
Into this?
- Yes - Ok

19
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,250
Hey man, come here

20
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,375
- Oh no, did you give to me again?

21
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,875
Baby, baby!

22
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,166
- Coming sister in law

23
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,583
Mix well to cover it all

24
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,291
Here, serve these tea to your brother and all in the hall

25
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,166
Ok.

26
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,875
Rishi.... Varsha...

27
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,041
I wrote it all...
Enough if we see as per that

28
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,833
None is eating sweets well these days
-Brother, tea

29
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:08,625
Baby, did you arrange new dress for dad?
- I arranged mother in law

30
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,333
This is green
- This is green

31
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,583
This is green.

32
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:14,916
Green is this, Sir

33
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:18,666
Hey, this is green
- Sir, this is green

34
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,458
Both are green tints.

35
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,083
This is green and that is yellow

36
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,500
He doesn’t listen, this is green and that is yellow...
You mental

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,833
Understood, this is green and this is yellow

38
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:33,000
Hello, reason for all this is...

39
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,250

40
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,125
My name is Somaraju.

41
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,958
All idiots in this village call me as Sodas Raju

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,375
For you to know about this festive atmosphere here...

43
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,125
I’ll narrate about a puppet show I did 10 days back.
Listen to it

44
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,541
Gey...

45
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,541
Sir, people of this house...
- Is it about Sodas Raju?

46
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,916
No sir, Soma Raju Sir
- No idea, I haven’t seen

47
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,250

48
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:38,500

49
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,250
Gey!

50
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,291
Muggu (Lime powder)

51
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,833
What, Muggu (Lime powder)?

52
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,333

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,125

Come on, have it man

55
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,208
What Dulla, you saw that Kolla Ratnam’s house right?

56
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:55,958
How is it?

57
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,250
Good! but, place is small. You think, it would work out?

58
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,291
You be calm dude, I’ll make it work out at any cost

59
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,166
Would he say my crop as cheap quality?

60
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:09,041
I’ll show what this Guthi Bhadram is,
to that Kolla Rathnam

61
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:14,416
(Humming)

62
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,125
Hey Mike!
- Yes

63
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:18,791
How long more, man?

64
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:19,875
Shall I start, sir?

65
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:25,416
No need, you have lunch,
and then start at leisure

66
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,500
Start it idiot, start

67
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:37,875
We hereby inform to everyone that Mr. Kolla Rathnam took a loan
from Guthi Bhadram and hasn’t paid back that money.

68
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:43,458
For the same house of Kolla Rathnam is being auctioned openly

69
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:49,916
We hereby inform to everyone that...

70
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:55,041
Mr. Guthi Bhadram took a loan from
Mr. Somaraju and hasn’t paid back that money.

71
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:59,500
For the same house of Mr. Guthi Bhadram is being auctioned openly

72
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,583
Somaraju?

73
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,625
Move guys, move

74
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:06,208
Hey Mike, what are you saying idiot?
- I don’t know all that, sir... He asked me to say the same.

75
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,708
Who?
- That Sodas Raju Sir.

76
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,916
Oh no! He is given a twist, man

77
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,208
What man, did you see Mr. Sodas Raju?

78
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,875
Sodas have already gone to your house

79
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,208
Oh no! Come on, let’s go
- Move

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,875
Oh no! Empty soda is here, no idea where he is

81
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,333
He’d be at the Lord Rama’s shed

82
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,458
Ok
- Ok Sir

83
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,416
What happened?
- Why do you ask so, empty soda is in

84
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:34,666
Is it, then where is he?

85
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:35,166
Sir...

86
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,541
Are you looking for Mr. Somaraju?
- Yes

87
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,666
It seems, he is at Lord Rama’s shed - Do you know?

88
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,750
Yes, I too am going there. Will you come?

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,250
Who is it?

90
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,500
Sodas Raju
- What?

91
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,750
Where is Mr. Somaraju?

00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,666
Where is Mr. Somaraju?

93
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:13,541
Where is Mr. Somaraju?

94
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,041
Hello, here

95
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,375
You don’t get tensed, man, You have no mistake, right?

96
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,208
Hey Chandram!

97
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,583
Hey, go and call him
- Ok Sir

98
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,625
Hello Sir... Raju sir is calling

99
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,375
He’s calling, Sir
- Ok

100
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,666
He’s coming, Sir.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,875
What man, are the sacks down?
- Yes

102
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,166
Ok! Someone has eyed on our mill

103
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:50,250
Ask that guard Eeri to drink less in the evenings,
we would get the thief rascal.

104
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,250
Somaraju Sir, Sir!

105
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,583
Forgive me, it was a mistake

106
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,750
What, how much pain do you have when I auctioned your house?

107
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:13,166
And when you did the same, he too would have the same pain, right?

108
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,458
Did you now get to know what pain is?

109
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:20,791
Guthi Bhadram and Kolla Rathnam
stand example for good friendship in this village.

110
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,750
Not that, Raju Sir

111
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:22,666
You wait.

112
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,125
Sir, courier
- Ok

113
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,208
I called you many times, Sir
- I forgot that phone at home.

114
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:38,041
What I wish to say is, be together like brothers
and don’t fight like brothers.

115
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,750
Ok, Raju Sir.

116
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,041
Come...

117
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:45,875
Hey, I’ll sign it later.
Ok, but where is this fellow?

118
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,208
Hey Kothem!

119
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,291
Sir, it is me

120
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,666
I hit after knowing.
What’s this nuisance, idiot?

121
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:08,458
Sir, today is your birthday celebration.
All these arrangements for your birthday celebration.

122
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,791
Hey, forget about my birthday.

123
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,458
Grand children have sent some courier

124
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,750
I should urgently go home and see what is in this, move
- Come on, Sir

125
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,875
Happy birthday to you.

126
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:35,541
Somaraju writing with blessings to son in law and baby
My blessings to my cute baby Varsha.

127
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,500
Say that I’d send the fish curry if someone is coming

128
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,208
This is the letter you wrote in my childhood, grandpa

129
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,458
Yuck, that face dish!

130
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,708
This isn’t face dish dear, the fish head dish.

131
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,125
Oh, wine bottle!

132
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,291
Dear Rsishi, come on give me a kiss.

133
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,625
Damn, the liquor smell

134
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:02,000
Bro, when did you arrive...

135
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:08,916
Why does it stop?

136
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh no, Sir!

137
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:14,333
How many times did I say you, not to grind pickle in mixie?

138
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,166
Come on hold it. Hey!

139
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,333
No sir, listen to me
- Shut up and move

140
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,750
Pickle has to be grinded manually.

141
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,041
Grandpa, it’s us

142
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,166
Didn’t you recognize?

143
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,791
I thought someone as you stood there watching.

144
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,958
Grandpa
- Grandpa, happy birthday

145
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,250
Thank you

146
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,291
Ok, instead of sending those birthday gifts by courier,
why couldn’t you bring as you were coming?

147
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,291
No grandpa, we came all of a sudden

148
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,750
Oh, I’m happy that you have come, dear.

149
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,333
Be seated.

150
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,166
Are you fine, Sir?

151
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,916
What Kothem, haven’t you yet stopped your plays?

152
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:12,666
Plays or my foot, half of my life is done in grinding these.

153
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,875
You need water, Sir.

154
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,666
Then I'll make coffee for you.

155
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,208
You say

156
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,125
Come on ... You say

157
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,791
Are you in love with anyone?

158
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,916
I mean, that is

159
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,750
By mistake, is it you?

160
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,375
Grandpa, we are...
-Grandpa, we both are in love

161
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,750
- Is it?

162
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,375
You should somehow make daddy agree

163
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,375
Please grandpa.

164
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,125
Please grandpa.

165
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,291
Very difficult.

166
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,458
From how long is all this happening?

167
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,166
From childhood, grandpa

168
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:50,791
Oh no!

169
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,666
Why didn’t you say me for so long?

170
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,583
Please grandpa, you should help
- Please grandpa...

171
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,125
Please...

172
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,125
No, not enough... you should request a bit more.

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
Will my dad agree?

174
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:06,416
Look, you are their kids and they are my kids

175
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,333
Why won’t they agree? I’ll make them agree

176
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Thanks grandpa..
- Thanks grandpa, love you

177
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:25,333
“Hey sky, reach slowly to earth as the rainbow”

178
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:33,708
“Hey earth, travel to skies as a tide of happiness”

179
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:39,291
“Like the sacred sound of bells in a lonely heart”

180
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,750
“This couple of doves landed in pleasure”

181
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:52,500
“Like the flow of moonlight on a full moon day”
“This love filled the light”

182
00:12:52,666 --> 00:13:01,583
“Heart made the sweet sound”
“It danced with happiness”

183
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:10,375
“Love blossomed beautifully with joy”
“It longed for the shower of blessings”

184
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:43,208
“Both the love birds smiled at each other”

185
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:47,625
“Even the tree on the river banks smiled”

186
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:52,333
“Bonding with warmth came along”

187
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:56,583
“To fulfil all the promises made as hopes”

188
00:13:56,583 --> 00:14:01,500
“Like there is no tomorrow”

189
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,583
“We shall be happy like this”

190
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:14,625
“With relation as a sweet tune”
“We shall move ahead greatly”

191
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,458
“Heart resounded saying love”

192
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,666
“Joy continued in fun”

193
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:33,708
“Love sang saying everyday is a festival”
“These love birds are freed now”

194
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,000
What, are grandson, granddaughter and all fine?

195
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,291
They are great, see they even sent the gifts

196
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,458
Ok, when did you come man? In the morning?

197
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:13,000
Hey, all his life is spent in busses
and trains in equal halves

198
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Ok, where are you going tomorrow?

199
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,000
to son’s house or the daughter's?

200
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,083
Don’t ask me again, man. I’m straddling in between the both

201
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,541
Shall I talk to them for you?
- Oh no.. No.

202
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:29,375
If you mess up now, I’ll be done for their new schemes.

203
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:35,125
Sir, they’re getting cold. Drink it or eat,
all in the village have slept.

204
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,375
Ok, Serve...

205
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:43,541
Hey, that’s drink and not any pesticide

206
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:48,208
It may be drink for us but pesticide for him
He doesn’t have a habit

207
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,166
Cheers!

208
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,541
Dude, we should be the same forever.

209
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,458
Drinking like this?
- Have you joked?

210
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,291
He’s fallen here when kicked in Hyderabad
for playing such bad jokes.

211
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,833
Hey, he isn’t yet habituated to let go soda gas from mouth

212
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,541
Added to mix up the sound again in sound

213
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,000
What if there are no items on his side, Sir?

214
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:33,375
What else, he’d take out his hearing aid from ears.
He is safe and we are dead

215
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,541
Hey, you go and eat. Rascal!

216
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,000
This idiot is high in talking

217
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,250
No dude, it is my pampering.

218
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,875
We are just two in such a big house, just one for each other

219
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,708
What dear?
- Daddy

220
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,333
Is all your household work done?
- Done daddy.

221
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,791
Are you in meeting with your friends, dad?

222
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:00,875
Yes dear

223
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,708
Enjoy and I’ll talk later

224
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,750
Ok dear, I’ll call later

225
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:09,041
He’s very lucky, dude. He has good kids unlike me

226
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,458
He’s further lucky.

227
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,958
He and his kids in America

228
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:19,291
There is fine, dude. But, what if I suddenly die there?
They’d finish everything right there

229
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:21,916
I too would have my own wish, right?

230
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,541
To die amongst you here

231
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,041
Still, who will care about our wishes in this age?

232
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,666
Hey, shall I say something?

233
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,791
They’d ask for last wish even with the prisoner to be hanged

234
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,666
But none would ask to old people like us

235
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,666
Well said, man.

236
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,458
Hey Chandram... For fun, say what your last wish is

237
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,833
He and I should always be the same forever.

238
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,541
Ranga, what about you?

239
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,250
It’s enough that my kids don’t fight
when I go to my children

240
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:59,750
Sir, two pegs are over and I’m sleeping. I’m sleeping

241
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,166
Hey, ask him. Doesn’t he have any wishes?

242
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,916
Hey Sodas Raju, you say

243
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:04,583
I won’t say

244
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,625
Sir, Somaraju Sir please say

245
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,041
All my children are happy, what more do I need man?

246
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:17,833
That’s fine.
Wishes are born in everyone’s heart. Say it

247
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,625
Say, dude

248
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,708
Any naughty wish?

249
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,750
Damn, nothing so

250
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,041
I wish it’s good if my grandson and granddaughter get married.

251
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:37,083
If my both kids become in laws,
my happiness in life would be so full

252
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,791
That is my wish, dude

253
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,833
Why do you say nothing when so much is in your heart?

254
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,083
Yes! You’ll know only when you ask your children about this, right?

255
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,250
Occasion should arise even for that.

256
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,625
Let’s see, come on have it

257
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,958
Ok, I’ll leave now. I got to leave tomorrow

258
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,250
Hey Chandram..
Call our lawyer to come once

259
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,083
Ok

260
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,083
Hey, yours is a very good thought and ask the kids immediately

261
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,666
Ok, ok!
- See you

262
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:09,833
See you.

263
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:37,708
Sir, master’s health is very bad.
You please start immediately

264
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,541
Madam, have you started?

265
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:45,833
Ok, madam.

266
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,208
Sir, they are arriving

267
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:01,291
Hey, Doctor should come correctly
by the time they arrive.

268
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,208
- I’ll take care of that Sir

269
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,166
Hey
- Sir

270
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,791
What will you inform the Doctor?

271
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,416
It’s like you have a high BP...

272
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,791
you’ve become very weak...

273
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,375
and that you aren’t listening when
said not to take more than two pegs of drink...

274
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:16,583
Rascal, who asked to say about my drink?
- Oh no

275
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,833
When I place my tiger here, your goat is dead, out!

276
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,166
Sir, you are eating away all my goats

277
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,083
I remembered by goats....

278
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,791
kids are arriving and won’t I have drink and
non vegetarian these two days?

279
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,458
Ok, shall I ask them not to come?

280
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,500
You rascal.

281
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,125
Oh no, Sir they arrived.
-Oh no, we have to hide coins.

282
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,416
Wait, I’m coming

283
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,916
What Sir, new car?

284
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,500
Why all that for you? How is dad now?

285
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,250
Oh no sir, you come and see. Master!

286
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,500
Latha, don’t open up about us buying a flat inside...
Even about the car

287
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,000
It’s good that you don’t speak up first
- Ok, move

288
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,208
Oh no, they’ve come
- Master

289
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,375
Father, how are you feeling?

290
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,375
What idiot, are you spicing up the food?
- No madam

291
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:14,500
No father in law, spice doesn’t suit for your body
- I see

292
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,208
Hey see, looks like Baby’s family is her

293
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,625
Come on, hold
- Why to take off all these now?

294
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,833
Hey, you don’t know about the people here.
Come on, remove fast

295
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,583
It doesn’t look if someone sees.
- Come on, none would see

296
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,041
Dad isn’t already feeling well

297
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,458
Daddy
- Come dear

298
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,125
Daddy

299
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,250
Did son in law come?
- What happened, dad?

300
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,625
Please don’t get up Father in law

301
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,208
What man, what did Doctor say?

302
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,625
What happened?
- Yes Doctor, Doctor Sir

303
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,416
Please come Doctor, here

304
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:47,833
Doctor...

305
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,791
BP levels are very high, heart is very weak.

306
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,583
You shouldn’t take too much strain

307
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,958
Then fine, write the tablets. Come on

308
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,333
You can come out and write Doctor, Sir
- Okay.

309
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:04,375
Come.

310
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,541
Hey..
-Sir.

311
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,708
Arrange for hot water immediately and they’d take bath.

312
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,875
They are tired in journey
- Ok Sir.

313
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,208
Go dear, you go and take bath
- You take rest, father in law

314
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,583
I’ll take care, you go.
- Careful father in law

315
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,375
Daddy...

316
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,541
Hey, you go and take bath.

317
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,125
Go.

318
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,708
Enough!
- Come on, have it.

319
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,708
It’s been very long since you ate food at our house

320
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,583
Talk, open up and talk

321
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:39,166
No father in law, we are anyways leaving tomorrow

322
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:45,833
I’m very happy that you came when called even after being so busy.

323
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:49,708
I wish to ask an important matter with you,
in this happy moment.

324
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,250
Nothing, I thought would have one fish piece.

325
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,291
Come on father in law, have it.

326
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,291
But, I really have a wish in my heart.

327
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:01,125
Shall I say?

328
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,208
Say, dad

329
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,375
She is my sister’s daughter.

330
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,750
He is my best friend’s son

331
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:14,625
I’m living without a fear to have given
my children to some strangers by bringing these.

332
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:19,541
I wish it’s better we get my granddaughter
and grandson married in the same way.

333
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:25,166
That doesn’t mean you should say immediately.

334
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,666
Think well tonight and say by morning.

335
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:30,791
Why all these now, daddy.

336
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:34,291
Even your health isn’t good and we got to leave back tomorrow

337
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:38,458
I mean, they two are into job recently.

338
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,041
We thought why marriage so fast

339
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,458
Youth now are into late marriages, Father in law

340
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:47,208
Come on, I’m not saying marriage immediately.

341
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,375
I felt it’d be good by fixing about that now.

342
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,375
Oh, like that?
- Yes, like that

343
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,625
What man, did you keep vegetables in baby’s car?
- Yes Sir

344
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:58,166
Hey, did you keep fish and dry prawns in Murali’s car

345
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,250
I’ll keep them now, Sir

346
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,291
Keep it fast, man.

347
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,666
Hey Raju!
- Hey, come on

348
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,250
Are your children leaving right now?
-Yes, Come...

349
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,125
Father in law

350
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,750
Daddy... why don’t you also come down to Hyderabad?

351
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,375
Why dear, all these are here to take care of me. Be seated

352
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:14,625
Give medicines time to time for father in law
- Ok madam

353
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,833
By the way, what did you think about
the wish I said in the night?

354
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,041
About the kids marriage.

355
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,166
We like it dad, but let’s ask him once and then

356
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,833
What about son in law?
- What you said yesterday is true, father in law

357
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,458
There won’t be any fear if we give in a known family

358
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,208
Thank God! All have agreed.

359
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:38,500
About the kids, I’ll take care of them.

360
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,583
Hey, will you always be with that phone?

361
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,666
Not me but you! I

362
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,791
never said anything when you checked share details on your phone

363
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:01,958
Don’t unnecessarily say anything.

364
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:02,916
I said the reality.

365
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,416
You’d always sit with that useless phone

366
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,125
When you sit idle without talking, what shall I do?

367
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,333
Shall I sit watching your face?

368
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,625
Look Rishi, if you feel what I do are wrong,
what you do also make me feel wrong.

369
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:14,916
This is what I don’t like.

370
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,000
When something is said for good, learn to listen

371
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,500
I don’t like others controlling me.

372
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,708
Get out if you don’t like.

373
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,541
Nobody is coming behind you here.

374
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,833
I can see my future with you, Rishi.

375
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:29,958
I am afraid.

376
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,875
Have you used? Have you used your weapon?

377
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:36,875
Hey, stop that crying first.

378
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,666
I can see my future now and right here.

379
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,500
Then, I too don’t need you, like this

380
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,041
Still you don’t give the value to humans, but just for money.

381
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,833
Hey, don’t talk too much.

382
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,083
It won’t set now for us, get lost.

383
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,583
Hey Guthi Bhadram

384
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,250
What, man?

385
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:14,250
Somaraju Sir died, it seems.

386
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:17,791
How did it happen?

387
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,916
I too don’t know. Come on, go fast

388
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,041
Very casual person,

389
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:55,833
very lucky man that he died in his sleep

390
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:02,375
He used to say one should always be in smiles and that is healthy.

391
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:08,458
And finally we are left behind with just his smile.

392
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,541
Daddy...

393
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,125
Daddy...
- Grandpa...

394
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:24,708
Daddy...

395
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,041
Daddy...

396
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,333
Brother...

397
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,875
Daddy, brother

398
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:46,875
Daddy...

399
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,208
Son in law, it’s getting dark. Let’s take him fast.

400
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,291
Control yourself.

401
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:56,833
Baby Varsha, we shall take grandpa.

402
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:01,458
Sir.

403
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,541
Lamp should be on till the 11th day.

404
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,291
keep observing.

405
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,708
Dear... Father in law.

406
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,291
Come uncle, be seated

407
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,416
What son, are you on any work?

408
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,125
It all happened suddenly, uncle

409
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,125
I’m mailing leave to office

410
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,583
Baby, Raghavamma

411
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,583
Rishi is gone to bring mother, father in law.

412
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,208
Have you just come father in law?
- Yes dear

413
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:49,291
I had slight body pains and slept

414
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,875
Murali, I just enquired from the priest.

415
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,208
As per Raju’s astrology the after death events
are on the 3rd day and then the 11th day

416
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,333
Murali, what are you thinking?

417
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:09,000
Nothing uncle, thinking 11 days leave for office...

418
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:12,791
Murali, you shouldn’t cross even the border till the 11th day

419
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:21,083
Only the relatives nearby attend on 3rd day and
on the 11th day, all from everywhere come down.

420
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,916
Money and all moved on always with his sign.
Now, you should take care.

421
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:34,416
As we have to make it grand, more money will have to be spent

422
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:42,916
It’s tough for us to bear everything,
please ask brother also to share some

423
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:46,208
Am I son to spend money, fine if it is as a debt?

424
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:50,166
How can it be so brother, same happened to you too along with us, right?

425
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,625
That was father in law’s responsibility and he did

426
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,166
Even this is your responsibility

427
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,625
Hey Varsha...

428
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:58,291
Go in

429
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,333
Look sister, we came for the last sight.

430
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:06,708
That’s all but what is this fifty-fifty deal and this discussion?

431
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:10,416
Brother in law, give if you feel as a responsibility or else no.

432
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,708
But, don’t slip your tongue.

433
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,583
Did you give when my dad died?

434
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,916
This too is similar

435
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:18,833
I said to lend money as loan if you don’t have money, in a good way.

436
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:19,875
What else did I say?

437
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,125
Leave all that, you built a house in Hyderabad recently right?

438
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,250
Did you call me for that house warming ceremony?

439
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:29,916
How would I feel?

440
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,000
Brother, it isn’t correct for you to talk so.

441
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,958
When we came to your house last month for a function,
you went around not looking at us like strangers

442
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,416
What is that called, then?
- Latha dear, you wait

443
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,958
Anybody will give money in this village by saying Raju’s name.

444
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:46,583
He’s given money to others as far as I saw,
but never took money from anyone.

445
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:52,208
But still, I asked as it would give his soul
satisfaction and not that I don’t get money in this village.

446
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:54,250
Why do you get into unnecessary discussions?

447
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,916
That’s what uncle, when I’m asking the same, he’s screaming to escape from it.

448
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,208
Fine for me and I’ll give half.

449
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:02,375
If you still don’t have, I’ll give the entire amount.

450
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:05,375
Let’s spend in equal halves from now and take in equal halves.

451
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:07,166
Don’t talk at your will.

452
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,375
Talk being in senses.

453
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,750
Hey, stop it.

454
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:13,166
You are going to be in laws soon and all this will be yours after the marriage.

455
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,000
No.. Father in law,

456
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,208
they are like this now and who knows how they’d be after marriage.

457
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:19,375
Nobody is sitting here in waiting for you

458
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,750
You gave word to Raju that you’ll get them married, right?

459
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,875
He asked me to get married at known
people’s house and I too am doing the same.

460
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:27,625
But not these and I’ll giving to those I know.

461
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:31,666
Not all this nonsense father in law, I said ok as he was ill that day.

462
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:32,500
But...

463
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:37,416
Otherwise, why would I give my daughter in such a house?

464
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:38,875
We too thought the same way

465
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,750
If she wasn’t at home, there wouldn’t be any issues.

466
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:45,125
Murali, what are you talking?

467
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:51,958
Son, it isn’t even one day since brother passed away
and what are these issues?

468
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:56,375
Don’t kill brother further by doing all such

469
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,291
You had great studies and all those are a waste.

470
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,083
Come in after your crying is done

471
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:14,916
Mother in law, Father...

472
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:33,750
Don’t feel sad dear.

473
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,041
I never expected the kids to talk so.

474
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,750
You should ask only me for all the expenses required now for brother.

475
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:52,250
Brother always used to say that
entire house should be full of happiness.

476
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:58,958
But these are thinking to be just happy for themselves only.

477
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,458
Don’t feel bad granny

478
00:34:15,458 --> 00:34:19,083
I couldn’t see your grandpa even for the last time.

479
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:26,750
What’s the use to know about the people around after death?

480
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:59,791
Yes true! As my sister said
what’s use to know after death?

481
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:06,208
I understood that my kids I saw that day
aren’t true and my bringing up wasn’t true.

482
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:12,500
I felt how to be amongst them for 11 days
in between them in such a situation.

483
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:19,666
They say entire life runs back in front of the eyes for anyone before death.

484
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,583
But it ran for me after death.

485
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:34,833
“So many joys and great happiness”

486
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:39,875
“When you turn into humans”

487
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:46,250
“Blossoming affections and strong bond”

488
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:51,375
“You are the world of love”

489
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,583
“Like the forts of smiles”

490
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,500
“Like the melodies by the bees”

491
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,958
“They mesmerized me as the tickles”

492
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:09,041
“When dad turned as mom”
“He served his love with affection”

493
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:13,250
“They pampered me as a couple”

494
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:20,541
“It’s a blossom when one is with the other”

495
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:26,583
“It’s heaven sleeping together after getting tired”

496
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:07,291
“Naughty tune is played saying everyday is a festival”

497
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:13,125
“Sharing this evergreen feel of love forever”

498
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:18,958
“Ours is a good time, let it be forever”

499
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,125
“Affection never gone away is strength”

500
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:37,500
“This human life is just for a few days”

501
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,083
“Only the love you share comes with you after death”

502
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:49,375
“None of your people will be your people”

503
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:54,708
“You are the only companion for you”

504
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,625
Hello, I’m Murali
- Say son

505
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,375
Dad’s 3rd day is tomorrow
- Oh, I see

506
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:09,916
And 11th day is next Wednesday.

507
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,250
Ok
- See you

508
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:16,041
Did you inform Nagaiah uncle?
- I said, mother in law

509
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:17,375
Where is this fellow?

510
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,000
Who, Kothem ?
- Yes

511
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,291
We shall serve food for brother

512
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,458
He is not to be seen from yesterday.

513
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,708
Ok! Baby, baby
- Coming, mother in law

514
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:31,083
We shall serve food for dad, bring in plantain leaf
- Ok, mother in law

515
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,541
It’d have been good if Kothem was home.
He’d have taken care of everything

516
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:39,916
Not for him to be, but check if everything is there at home.

517
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:41,500
He isn’t such a guy.

518
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:46,333
Murali! You too go up with Baby,
it’s good that you both are there. Go!

519
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:09,625
Ok, I’ll go down

520
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:24,250
Hey, what are you doing for so long?
Are you still here?

521
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:26,666
Hey, why are you crying?

522
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,875
Where are crows in these days?

523
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,500
Come on now! Sister called and
said they aren’t coming for the 3rd day.

524
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,416
They are sending that Santosh idiot, be careful.

525
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:38,333
You know about him, right?
Come on, let’s go down

526
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,875
I forgot to say by the way,

527
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,500
we too are going home along with Santosh on the day after.

528
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:44,958
Are you getting me?

529
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,416
Hey, what are you doing here? Go down

530
00:39:51,166 --> 00:39:53,166
What did you do, then?
- I made everything into ponds, dude

531
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:54,583
All are doing the same now and it’ll work out well.

532
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:56,666
Hey, where are you coming from?
- Did you listen to this, dude?

533
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,250
It seems crows didn’t touch the food offered for Raju Sir

534
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:02,125
Then, some big wish must’ve been left behind for him.

535
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,541
Tomorrow is 3rd day, right?

536
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:04,416
Yes
- Let’s see

537
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:09,333
Hey Santosh, where are you?

538
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:10,875
- Rajahmundry

539
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:11,791
Is it?

540
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:15,291
Have you heard? Then, talk to him.

541
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:16,416
Sir

542
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,750
What’s the delay?
- We are right here Sir, we are coming.

543
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:21,250
Come fast.
- Ok Sir, ok

544
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:28,083
What Satti, increasing the sound as you wish right?

545
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,833
I’ve become very cheap to you.

546
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,500
For you and for my dad

547
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:35,375
I’m observing, man. My dad is attending birthdays...

548
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,958
and parties and is asking me to go for deaths.

549
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,458
I’ll say once I become MLA.

550
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:43,125
I’ll give you a gift and a return gift to my dad.

551
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,875
Ok Sir, I’ll reduce it
- No need, now

552
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,958
Hey stop, stop the vehicle

553
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,708
Why Sir, will you go for toilet?
-No, idiot!

554
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,083
Go back

555
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:55,208
Stop, stop man

556
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,625
Where to go?
- I should go to the next village

557
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:02,916
Hey, unlock the door.

558
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,083
Maybe you can’t see him

559
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,208
If you first go, open that door, he’ll get in.

560
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,291
Ok, close the door

561
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:22,416
How long is it?
- What Sir?

562
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,000
Not you, Satti idiot. You drive

563
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:27,125
Me, Sir? It’s been 4 days since I died

564
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:30,500
What was your profession?
- Politician

565
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,041
Politics?
- Yes

566
00:41:32,041 --> 00:41:32,666
- What happened, then?

567
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,500
I contested in my village as MLA

568
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,583
You just stopped car and picked me up and that’s my village

569
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,375
Then why are you going to the next village, for toilet?

570
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:45,291
No Sir,
for that guy not to see my grave there and laugh

571
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,708
Who is he?
- That MLA who won

572
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:49,333
That means you...?

573
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:53,041
I lost and drank pesticide unable
to bear that pain and died.

574
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,041
So, you lost?

575
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,125
I’ve been saying to be the lost MLA

576
00:41:57,208 --> 00:41:58,583
Hey Satti, stop the car

577
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:01,041
What happened, Sir? Should I give him water?
-Ask him to get down

578
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:02,000
Why Sir?

579
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:05,125
I don’t like the losers and especially those losing in politics

580
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,833
Stop idiot, ask him to get down.

581
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,583
To lose is a bad thing and to die drinking pesticide is further bad.

582
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,875
Ok, move on.

583
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:17,125
Hey, open the door man.

584
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:18,958
Ok Sir

585
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,916
What, if a politician? Get down

586
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,083
He got down, close the door man.

587
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:32,875
Ok Sir

588
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,708
(Chants)

589
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:52,916
Chandraiah Sir - Sir

590
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:56,708
Collect the bones and mix them in
Godavari river on 7th day, don’t forget.

591
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:57,875
Ok priest Sir.

592
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:01,916
Madam, you’ve arranged for everything liked by Somaraju Sir, right?

593
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:05,541
He’d stay right here for these 11 days and will be observing it all

594
00:43:06,833 --> 00:43:08,375
(Chants)

595
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,708
No problem Sir, keep even that here

596
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,708
Madam, the process completed well

597
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:39,208
Chandraiah Sir
- Sir

598
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:41,916
I’ll send the list of materials needed on 11th day
- Ok Sir

599
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:46,833
When did you come from US, uncle?

600
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,958
I started once I came to know
But, my flight got delayed

601
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,291
Uncle...

602
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:53,125
Don’t feel sad, son.

603
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,000
All will have to die.

604
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,583
But Raju passed away ahead of us

605
00:43:58,208 --> 00:43:59,083
Janaki!

606
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:03,833
Uncle..
- Don’t cry dear

607
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,958
He always used to say about you all.
Seeing you all like this, I feel like seeing him.

608
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:19,750
If you are all happy, we’d say to him that
all his kids are happy when we go to him.

609
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,333
Hey, what are you opening all the doors like mad fellow?

610
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:42,041
Hello uncle....
- Hello

611
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:43,791
What happened?

612
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,208
That is, the doors...
- That is...

613
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:47,958
For the air in to go out

614
00:44:48,291 --> 00:44:51,958
Not so Sir, on the way...
- Why do you need? Why for you, go

615
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:54,166
What happened on the way?

616
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,916
Cigarette on the way and he made it all, a mess.

617
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,041
Is it so?

618
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,125
Is this the house?
- Yes

619
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,625
This looks like a big lost party office.

620
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:03,500
He is my father in law.

621
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,166
Brother in law, he looks very young. Swine flu?

622
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,916
No, that is the picture from young age.

623
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,166
Is everybody fine?
- fine.

624
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,291
Hello Sir
- Hello

625
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:15,958
Is water and current perfect
- Yes Sir

626
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:17,583
Is the hospital working fine?

627
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:18,625
Come on, let’s go

628
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,333
Future politician, uncle.

629
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:22,583
All those later, why now?

630
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:24,166
Ok, fine! Take care...

631
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:39,125
Wash your feet and go.

632
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:51,208
Can he see me?

633
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:53,750
The tumbler.

634
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,291
Did he pass away?

635
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:42,291
Yes, pray without ruining my prestige.

636
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:45,625
I prayed, move

637
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:51,208
Are you good?
- Ok, fine

638
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:54,291
Shall we leave?
- Ok! See you

639
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:57,875
Sit here, man
- Ok

640
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:01,666
It isn’t vacant

641
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:02,333
What?

642
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:03,458
I mean, it isn’t clean.

643
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:07,541
Uncle....

644
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:09,750
Uncle...

645
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,125
I’m right here, what?

646
00:47:11,208 --> 00:47:12,875
I mean why here, why not go back in the night.

647
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,000
I men why here tonight, instead let’s go back.

648
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,583
Brother in law asked to come tomorrow, right?

649
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,416
Not that...
- Huh!

650
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,375
What do we do here, till then?

651
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:20,958
Go eat and sleep.

652
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,916
You mean, that’s the only work I do.

653
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,833
Ok, where is the food?

654
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,166
Don’t die, this way it seems.

655
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:31,416
I know it is that side.

656
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:33,875
You know my foot.
- I’m seeing for the guy to hand you over.

657
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:39,000
I felt who could see me after I turn into a soul.

658
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:42,958
My luck and I was visible to that Santosh.

659
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:48,291
Because of no way, I beg him to help me to fulfil my last wish.

660
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:51,916
I think the food session isn’t over yet.

661
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,291
Are you hungry?

662
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:56,750
Mill people haven’t come yet and it’d take some more time

663
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,291
All should have food, right?

664
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,166
Ok

665
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:03,000
I forgot to say, some friend of Shivaji brother is coming it seems.

666
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,583
I think they are in some plan
- He’s an idiot, leave it

667
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:09,708
Mom and daddy!

668
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:14,000
Sister of my father in law.

669
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:15,333
Hello madam.
- Hello...

670
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,041
Aunty, my friend Ramesh.

671
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:18,333
He stays right here in Tanuku.

672
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:23,208
He is a big contractor and says to
buy the land under his feet, anywhere

673
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:25,541
Good, move on.

674
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,333
Come on.

675
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,541
My brother’s son, go and wish him.

676
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,666
Hello...
- Hello.

677
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,250
I am a contractor.

678
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:48,083
What do you do?

679
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:50,875
We both are into jobs in Hyderabad.

680
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:51,583
I see.

681
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:56,416
I saw your dad in Shivaji’s marriage.
He was very jovial man

682
00:48:56,708 --> 00:49:00,083
Dad... Mill people have come and they wish to meet you.

683
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:02,166
Ok, see you Sir.
- Thank you

684
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:03,416
Hello Sir...
- Hello Sir

685
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:09,000
Raju Sir always said a person is good when
house is good and that village is good when person is good.

686
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:11,416
He never let me come to his house for any need.

687
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,458
We never expected such a day to come, Sir.

688
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,750
He took care of us too like his children, Sir.

689
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:18,708
Move on, they should eat after you finish. Move on.

690
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:19,666
Ok Sir, we’ll go...
- Come on, in

691
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,125
Come on, in
- Move, let’s eat

692
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,500
Your father in law and his mill are
very famous in the surrounding areas.

693
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,083
Even the mill is worth more than 15 Crores.

694
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:32,291
Ok, let’s meet on the 11th day, start now

695
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:32,833
Ok.

696
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:42,583
I, Santosh with my magical cleanliness...
Sorry with my soul cleanliness

697
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:45,333
Next... Hey buffering... Huh!

698
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:49,750
I, Santosh... Oh no!

699
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:54,000
You can never become a politician though you practice a lot like this.

700
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
No, those alive should say that.

701
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,125
Santosh...

702
00:49:58,291 --> 00:49:58,916
Damn!

703
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,833
Listen to me grandson.

704
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,958
Thank God, no grandpa here.

705
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:08,333
Yes, this is peaceful.

706
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:13,166
I should get a good talisman tied once I’m back in Hyderabad,
so that I don’t see these souls

707
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:14,875
It’s become a big mess

708
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:18,166
Oh no, what grandpa even here?

709
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:19,958
My foot!

710
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:24,250
You made me run around the house like making
a kid run behind the ice cart.

711
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:25,791
What do you need now, grandpa?

712
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:26,958
A small help.

713
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:30,333
I’ll do it grandpa, I’m in the middle and let me finish.
I beg you, grandpa.

714
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:36,333
No peace even in the bathroom.

715
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,708
Still, won’t you souls have no work?

716
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:41,416
You all come and fall on me with list after dying
when I have my own problem

717
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:47,291
Then say what you need and I’ll help you.
If that is done, you should help me

718
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,083
I’m unable to anything being alive
and what can you do?

719
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,375
I’ll give a great idea.

720
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:53,000
Is It!

721
00:50:53,666 --> 00:50:57,583
If your idea is of no use to me,
you should never again be seen to me. Ok?

722
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:58,708
Ok

723
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:00,541
You know my father?

724
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:02,708
Your father’s father is my friend.

725
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,791
My father decided that I’m useless in politics.

726
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:08,833
You should make my dad say I’m a great man.

727
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:09,625
Will you do?

728
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:13,166
Does your father have any problems?

729
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:14,208
That’s me, right?

730
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:18,666
I thought you were problem only to me.
So, you are a problem even to your dad, then?

731
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:21,208
Is there any problem other than that?

732
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:24,791
Another problem means, my father lost election last year.

733
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:28,416
That’s why they are giving ticket to an NRI,
who has a rich man.

734
00:51:28,416 --> 00:51:31,125
My dad is very angry in that matter
and that is his problem.

735
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:34,458
Then, call your father
- Now?

736
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:36,458
He’d come here and hit if I call now.

737
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:44,958
You first call him and ask him to make that NRI sing national
anthem without any mistakes in front of the media.

738
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:47,500
If this doesn’t work out, you’ll have it.

739
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,083
Father, it is me...

740
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:54,333
I know who you are, but say what’s the matter.

741
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:55,791
Your seat is given to some other, right?

742
00:51:56,416 --> 00:52:01,041
For you to get back that seat, make that NRI
fellow sing National anthem in front of the media.

743
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,083
All this is a waste, grandpa.
My father never cares about any of my word.

744
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:12,750
Politician at this time would talk even if a dog calls up.

745
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,000
This matter just now...

746
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,166
Hey, you mean to say I’m a dog?

747
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:19,583
You’ll know that in the morning. First go and sleep.

748
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,000
I’ll finalise even your matter in the morning.

749
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:28,125
Bro, can you listen now?

750
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:28,875
Hello...

751
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,250
Tell me man, I can hear now.

752
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:30,750
Thank God

753
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:34,250
Net isn’t good here, just check the share market and inform.

754
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:35,833
Ok, will see and tell

755
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:39,291
Hey, is Varsha still the same?

756
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:41,208
Yes

757
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,333
We know about a few, right?
They talk whatever they feel like to blabber.

758
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:48,166
We should maintain some distance

759
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,875
Ok dude, bye.

760
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:54,750
Stop!

761
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:00,458
I should talk to you for two minutes.

762
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:05,583
I didn’t blabber at my will. I spoke the reality.

763
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:08,375
I too said the reality.

764
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,458
You feel, I started it again right?

765
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:14,958
I haven’t come here to fight or talk with you.

766
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:18,500
I called to inform that we are just cousins from now.

767
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:23,208
Being cousins isn’t the matter now,
we shall celebrate grandpa’s 11th day well

768
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:29,000
Looks like you are still in the same thoughts.
Go and play your game

769
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:32,125
Cousins, my foot.

770
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:36,291
Son in law, it feels good that
you too stay back till 11th day is done.

771
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:41,041
If you feel bored, come towards our mill.
It’s yours anyways in future, right?

772
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:44,541
You shouldn’t say that father in law,
those who should tell needs to say.

773
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:52,458
Murali, here is father’s death certificate.

774
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:56,708
This is bank pass book.
Your signature is valid as the nominee

775
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,875
What are you watching?
Get ready fats and we shall leave.

776
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:05,125
Uncle, we don’t need anybody.

777
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,458
You should be here and take care of everything till 11th day is done.

778
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,666
What’s this uncle, there’s just 2 Lacks and odd in this?

779
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:18,916
I don’t know son.

780
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:21,625
What don’t know uncle, what did he do with all this money?

781
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,791
Damn! They say no bones for the donating hand,
looks like he has no hand at all.

782
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:28,541
What’s that Murali?

783
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,250
Brother, why did you come to this fellow?

784
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:33,791
I’ve already informed that I’d bear all the expenses.

785
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,958
Murali, you do as you wish with that money.

786
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:39,875
But before saying something just
remember that you are saying it to your dad.

787
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:41,125
Damn!

788
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,333
Grandpa, phone

789
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:00,291
Lift the call and talk.

790
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:04,041
Grandpa, it’s my dad and I’m gone now.

791
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,208
You’re great, man
- Great!

792
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,875
Father, I’m Santosh speaking.

793
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:15,166
Yes, I’m saying you are great.

794
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:16,041
What happened father?

795
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,791
That fellow became a big fool as
he couldn’t sing Vandematharam in front of media.

796
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,833
I got the seat because of you, son.
Is this idea yours or...

797
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,375
Where do I get father, grandpa...

798
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:30,833
Idiot, say yours
- Mine, it’s mine

799
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:33,250
Is everything fine
- Yes, father.

800
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,041
When are you coming back?

801
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:34,750
It’s tomorrow....

802
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,833
Say, you are coming after some days.

803
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:40,541
I’ll be here for some more days, father.
More ideas will come if I stay here

804
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:44,541
Why alone? You and Shivaji uncle be right there.

805
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,500
Ok father, see you.

806
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:50,416
Grandpa, my father said me great. You are super.

807
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:52,416
Say now grandpa, I’ll do whatever you need.

808
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,666
I too should feel the same happiness seeing
my kids like how your father felt by seeing you.

809
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,166
I didn’t understand.

810
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:03,916
In your language, my kids should get along
and my family should be happy.

811
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:05,666
Understood?
- Completely...

812
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,583
Still, uncle said it all over phone to me.

813
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,125
You happily sit here, I’ll just be gone and come back.

814
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,458
I’ve done so many settlements as such in Hyderabad.

815
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:17,458
I, Santosh am giving assurance.

816
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,458
I’ll do the settlement

817
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:23,250
For the grandpa, by the grandpa...

818
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:33,666
I expected.

819
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:42,875
Instead of crying so,
why don’t you say and cry?

820
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:47,125
No grandpa, I just went singing songs.

821
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,083
So...

822
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:53,333
Dining table and this place is correct

823
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:58,291
If I take a class in single sitting,
all will sit along and have lunch in five minutes.

824
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:00,375
Uncle!

825
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,541
This guy is a TikTok fellow! Uncle!

826
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,666
Hey uncle..
- Why’s this hug? Are you still not ready?

827
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:11,708
We are not going back to city now.

828
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,166
Not going?
- No

829
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:14,791
Should I call your father or what?

830
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,666
Crazy my dad said it himself.

831
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:17,500
What did he say?

832
00:57:17,666 --> 00:57:19,041
Shall I say another matter?
- Say

833
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:20,458
My father got the MLA seat
- What?

834
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,000
Maintain the same expression and I’ll just come back.

835
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,166
I’ll be gone to the mill.

836
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,500
Uncle, come here

837
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:29,041
Be seated, uncle
- What?

838
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:29,833
Just five minutes.

839
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:33,375
I asked you to maintain expression, right?

840
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,000
Say...

841
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:34,583
Sit.

842
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,416
What I say now...

843
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:48,958
What I say now may sound like big words for you.

844
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:50,666
Nothing wrong but I have no way out.

845
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:55,291
If there’s any matter, we shall talk face to face and settle.

846
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:58,041
But, to fight in the dark is a waste matter

847
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:03,750
Do we take any of these wealth,
properties or inner wear with us to the heavens?

848
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:05,791
Now grandpa died, hello listen.

849
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:07,708
Grandpa died and did he take anything?

850
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:09,333
All the inner wear too in that room is lying there.

851
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:12,458
You’d die tomorrow soon
- Hey, what are you saying?

852
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:14,500
Tomorrow means not tomorrow, uncle. It’s in general...

853
00:58:14,916 --> 00:58:16,916
you’ll die and I’ll die.

854
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:19,250
Do we take anything up?
We won’t take anything with us

855
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:26,041
And do we need all these fights, hitting the flower pots
and again asking on phone like why did you hit the flower pot?

856
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,833
That’s why silently be together.

857
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:32,916
I’ll sit here and close my eyes.

858
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:36,000
By the time I open my eyes,
all of you should be singing the family song together.

859
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:37,166
Ok?

860
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:38,375
Take care now.

861
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:41,875
Ready!

862
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:44,666
The train is coming... Not this one.

863
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:49,166
Here, there and everywhere...

864
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:50,041
Ready!

865
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:52,583
He won’t change

866
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:02,666
Oh! Did it happen so?

867
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:04,666
Yes grandpa, what’s the next plan?

868
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,250
Take that photo and throw it down

869
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:43,291
You’d say anything grandpa! But, if anyone sees I too will
change into a soul and we both will have to play hide and seek right here.

870
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,916
Nothing will happen, do what I said.

871
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,000
As you wish.

872
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:55,333
Sure, grandpa?

873
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:01,458
Grandpa! Where is grandpa?

874
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:03,833
You got me well trapped, grandpa! I’m gone now

875
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:19,291
How did the photo break?
- Baby, careful! Glass pieces may pierce

876
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:23,166
Why did it happen so at this time?

877
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,458
When all are in the house like this, the same will happen.

878
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:28,083
It happened so as you are like this in the house.

879
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:31,916
Yes, you feel like everything is given to us
by you and thus we are like this

880
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:36,083
If not are we any diseased like you to sit separately like you?

881
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:41,250
Yes brother in law, when people like you come in as in laws,
we will be blessed with BP and Sugar

882
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,541
Oh no, bad time.

883
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:51,458
I can’t better these guys
- Me too

884
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:55,250
Let me ask you something, were you good to us any time?

885
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:59,875
Once when I took money from you when in problem,
you gave and took interest for the same.

886
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:01,000
That is you.

887
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:04,333
Added, you lied saying that money wasn’t yours.

888
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:06,083
I remember everything.

889
01:01:06,833 --> 01:01:11,041
I understand the same, people like you say the same after taking money.

890
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:13,791
Has at least anyone come when my dad wasn't feeling well?

891
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:17,791
Who said not to be getting a leave when called
and informed about his 11th day after his death?

892
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:18,375
It was you!

893
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:22,375
You get a cutting in salary by taking leave and that is your feeling.

894
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,958
Money is important for you and
people are important for us.

895
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,333
Is this what we get to listen staying here for so long?

896
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,416
Not that...
- What?

897
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:30,666
Latha... What is this?

898
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:33,041
Mother in law, you know nothing and it was us who felt bad

899
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:33,833
You go in.

900
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,250
Ok, I’ll go in and you both die fighting with each other.

901
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:40,875
Yes brother, you are too good. Do you remember?

902
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:45,083
When we gifted gold for Varsha’s saree function,
you didn’t even gift a saree at least as a tradition.

903
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,250
That shows who is greedy about money.

904
01:01:48,416 --> 01:01:49,333
You stop it, dear.

905
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,208
Have you ever given us food when we came to your house in city?

906
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,583
Leave it, have you at least offered us tea?

907
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:57,916
Not all these, you insulted saying no need of
anyone after seeing the pass book recently, right?

908
01:01:57,916 --> 01:02:00,500
Brother in law, you don’t say anything more now
- You don’t talk too much.

909
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,333
What are you talking?

910
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:03,208
What are you talking?
-Daddy, stop it!

911
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:06,541
Why do you say each other unnecessarily?

912
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:09,000
Those won’t come back again.

913
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:11,666
Mom, move on.

914
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:20,083
Hey, if you touch this our relation won’t go well

915
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:23,958
To hell, how do I stay back here for five more days?

916
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:36,416
That day, I thought to remind their love in between,
even by breaking my family photo

917
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:41,916
But they considered big and small in terms of money,
got into unnecessary misunderstandings...

918
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,500
I felt the forgot about the real love in between them.

919
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:52,000
They looked very great even to me,
who always used to say my children were great.

920
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:59,000
Condition of my brain seeing so much in life was
like that of the marble stuck in the soda bottle.

921
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:04,708
That day for the first time, I couldn’t be in my own house.

922
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:07,000
Grandpa!

923
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:08,333
Grandpa!

924
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:10,583
Have you vanished again?

925
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:12,791
Good that I knew this magic to get vanished.

926
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,000
Then die.

927
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,250
Oh, are you here? What is this, grandpa?

928
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:20,666
Do they sleep outside the house
in your village when you are disturbed?

929
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,916
Nothing less for this angers

930
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:25,791
What is next now? Do you go and sleep outside the village now?

931
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:28,625
Leave all these and watch this TiKToK video, grandpa

932
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:30,750
Do they need this, grandpa?

933
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,166
Damn it! Put that in.

934
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:35,333
Ok, I kept it
- Come with me and I’ll say

935
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:42,583
Grandpa, following you was…

936
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:48,000
Open the Bhoshanam(locker)
- Did you scold?

937
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:49,541
I said the box, man. Open it.

938
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,541
Take out the diary from that.

939
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,208
Oh wow! Grandpa, is this your biopic?

940
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,958
Make it fast, grandson!
There is no time for us, man

941
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,083
No time my friend, is it the death or…
Oh, you’re already dead

942
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:04,208
Yes, move now.

943
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:08,750
Keep that diary there.

944
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,666
Oh! You feel by keeping this diary there,
they’d read it and do your biopic, right?

945
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,625
Sodas Raju, I have no death

946
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,458
Ok, I’ll put it.

947
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,916
Are you reading the paper? Ok, read. Read it.

948
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:44,375
Good news!

949
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:50,666
Grandpa!

950
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:54,125
Grandpa, see

951
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:58,958
What grandpa, are you tensed?

952
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:00,291
Yes, grandson.

953
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:04,416
You don’t understand something.
You are long dead and why tension now?

954
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:07,666
Look, they are seeing it.

955
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:15,291
You’ll sleep outside the village with this tension now.

956
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:16,125
Bad time!

957
01:05:22,583 --> 01:05:25,250
See now and the story begins
- Oh!

958
01:05:28,208 --> 01:05:30,416
Mom, your spectacles are here.

959
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:32,250
I’m in the kitchen, dear. Bring it here.

960
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,250
Ok, I’m bringing.

961
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:35,583
Grandpa, your biopic is a doubt.

962
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:39,333
Mahanati biopic...
- What's wrong with you?

963
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:43,583
Why not say they came?'
- Did you get it good?

964
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,666
Whatever, but yours is a very loose tongue.

965
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,458
Oh no, where is the diary?
- Where is that fellow?

966
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,875
I believed you so much, idiot.
You cheat me this much

967
01:05:56,041 --> 01:05:57,875
Hey, do whatever you can, idiot

968
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:03,458
Let it be gone. You don’t feel tensed

969
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:06,041
Take the tablets and rest.

970
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,000
What’s wrong, dear?

971
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:23,541
His friend does real estate business, brother.

972
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,541
He and his friend together bought a land.

973
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,291
He invested money in it.

974
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:30,541
Now, he says that land as his and that it is on his name.

975
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:32,375
And he is very much tensed.

976
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:35,166
One minute, what is his name dear?

977
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:36,500
Srinivasa Rao, brother.

978
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:38,916
Where does he stay?
- Kukatpally

979
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,833
That Govinda real estates, brother.

980
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:41,875
One minute...

981
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:49,666
Govinda Real Estates Srinivas, it seems from Kukatpally

982
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,416
We should get a call within one hour.

983
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:59,416
No problem at all dear,
I spoke on the phone and you have nothing to worry

984
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:02,458
You’ll get a call in some time.
Come in dear, I got to talk to you.

985
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:12,458
Did Father in law write to give
the mill to them if we get Rishi and Varsha married?

986
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:14,916
Yes dear
- Really, brother?

987
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:18,500
Latha, what is that Srinivasa Rao
calling now and saying sorry?

988
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:21,125
Sivaji brother has done this for us.

989
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:24,250
Thanks brother in law.

990
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:26,750
I was very tensed.

991
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:29,083
Sorry for everything.

992
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:32,750
Come on, what sorry brother in law.
Why all these in between us?

993
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,791
You are happy, right?

994
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:37,166
Both you and we are happy when you are like this, right?

995
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:43,416
Murali... Just four days are left behind for the 11th day.

996
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,625
We shall arrange for the tents and the other materials.

997
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:48,833
I and Rishi will go and give order for the food.

998
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:52,250
Grandpa...

999
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:54,666
Grandpa! Your family film is super hit

1000
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,166
You know theatre is running houseful inside

1001
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:01,791
So, my diary plan is working out.

1002
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:07,708
If we take it all in this size aunty, we get photo from here...

1003
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:11,500
Why are all talking about something?
Why not say that even to me?

1004
01:08:11,541 --> 01:08:15,583
Nothing, a small discussion about
Father in law’s flex and paper Ads

1005
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:19,041
Brother, are you seeing any matches for Varsha?

1006
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:21,583
I thought it’d have been good if it was a boy like Rishi.

1007
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,791
We too thought it’d be good if girl was like Varsha.

1008
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:29,791
Yes, even dad asked for the same then.

1009
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:30,916
Yes brother in law.

1010
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:32,458
Have it mother in law.

1011
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,708
Here, even sister in law is here while we are talking.

1012
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,916
Brother, they say good should happen
at the house experiencing the bad, right?

1013
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:39,833
What, sister in law?

1014
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:42,708
About Rishi and Varsha’s marriage, sister in law.

1015
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:45,125
But, we should ask even Varsha and Rishi, right?

1016
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,291
Varsha, come here dear

1017
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:51,083
Daddy...

1018
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:55,333
If you say grandpa’s photo size,
I and Chandraiah grandpa will go to town, order and get it.

1019
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:56,416
Wait son, I’ll say.

1020
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:00,125
Rishi, you and Varsha are in the same profession.

1021
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,458
You both know each other well and
added you both are cousins.

1022
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:06,500
That’s why we are thinking to get you married.

1023
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:09,666
What, why all this now, mom?

1024
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:11,750
Why about now and all, come on say

1025
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:18,750
I don’t like, mom.

1026
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,250
Same for me too...

1027
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:30,083
I don’t have any thought as such.

1028
01:11:08,791 --> 01:11:09,666
Again!

1029
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:14,500
Walk in the morning for health, crazy grandpa?

1030
01:11:15,541 --> 01:11:17,458
I expected something but something else is happening.

1031
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:19,708
Don’t get so much tensed grandpa, say what’s there in that diary?

1032
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:25,500
I wrote to give my mill in equal halves to them
when my grandson and granddaughter get married.

1033
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:28,125
What grandpa?

1034
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:31,791
My last wish is to get my grandson and granddaughter married.

1035
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:34,250
You just said enough if your children
get along and what’s this marriage now?

1036
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:38,083
They get married only if they get along, right?
Use your brains

1037
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:39,791
Oh no, I’m going mad.

1038
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:44,875
I’ll say whether I should use or you are using me,
but you say the matter clearly.

1039
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:46,125
Sshh...!

1040
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:52,416
My grandson and granddaughter came
to me and asked to get them married.

1041
01:11:53,583 --> 01:12:01,208
Then while I was thinking to somehow get them married
and how it goes if write the mill jointly on their name...

1042
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,541
my children agreed for their marriage by themselves.

1043
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:07,166
I thanked God for that, but I suddenly passed out.

1044
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:15,291
Later as my kids were fighting each other saying
not to get them married, I with you have used my diary.

1045
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:16,791
Bad luck!

1046
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:20,291
My kids came along but their kids didn’t agree for the marriage.

1047
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:23,916
We should somehow get them married.

1048
01:12:24,458 --> 01:12:26,916
I should help in person to get them both married.

1049
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:27,791
Yes!

1050
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:30,541
They both are the reason to go ruined in reality.

1051
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:34,958
Your grandson is a rogue and
your granddaughter is a crack.

1052
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:37,791
Now, should I be here and see when they both are getting married?

1053
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:39,083
Impossible!

1054
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:44,708
Even if you plan something else and
try to get them married, I’d myself ruin that.

1055
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:45,875
I challenge!

1056
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:50,541
Why did he go like this?

1057
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:53,208
What’s my situation now?

1058
01:12:55,208 --> 01:12:56,375
Give one shot of toddy, man

1059
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,708
Here, take it
- What is this?

1060
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:02,916
Damn!

1061
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:04,250
How will you drink, then?

1062
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:06,250
Don’t you have a beer mug?

1063
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:07,666
I have the plastic mug, I use in the mornings.

1064
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:08,291
Shall I get that?
- Dam it!

1065
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:10,750
Come on show it?
- What’s this now?

1066
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,416
I mean spread your palms
- Oh, that?

1067
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:14,625
Wait!

1068
01:13:15,875 --> 01:13:16,416
Pour now.

1069
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,375
Santosham!

1070
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,000
Grandpa, have you come even here?

1071
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,541
Grandpa, what am I grandpa Sir?
- Oh, you too are here right?

1072
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:30,541
I got to speak something personally, you leave.
Give that pot here.

1073
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:31,541
You go now

1074
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:33,041
Grandpa!

1075
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,375
Why are you calling me again?

1076
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:35,958
Not you man, you go from here.

1077
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:38,083
Here, take this and leave now.

1078
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:40,958
Why does he say me grandpa, did I become so old?

1079
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,208
They lick even pickle along with toddy, you know that?

1080
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:47,250
Enough of the pickle made by you
and your grand children. You go, grandpa

1081
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,625
Santosham, listen to me son.

1082
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:54,916
Believe me, dear

1083
01:13:56,291 --> 01:13:59,916
I’m here believing your grand children
and came to this place believing in you.

1084
01:13:59,916 --> 01:14:03,666
Just the name is Santosh and no happiness in life because of you all.

1085
01:14:04,041 --> 01:14:08,875
I understand that you’re scolding my grand children,
but I’d understand why only when you say the reasons, right?

1086
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:10,666
You didn’t understand?
- No

1087
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:13,458
You know how was I?
I was like a Lion

1088
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,958
Hi!

1089
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:23,833
Oh no, who are you idiot?

1090
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:27,166
Before death, Atma Rao
and Devadas after death.

1091
01:14:27,166 --> 01:14:28,541
Who cares whatever you are, rascal?

1092
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:30,666
Bro! Bro!

1093
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,666
I’m getting tortured with these souls.

1094
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:33,833
Damn!

1095
01:14:36,666 --> 01:14:37,541
What’s your problem, man?

1096
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:39,041
Looks like you’re going somewhere in a hurry?

1097
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,375
By chance, is it a love problem?
- Yes, love

1098
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:44,791
Oh, is she your lover or are you her lover?

1099
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:47,041
Why do you care?
- Why don’t you say, brother?

1100
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:48,458
She is my lover.

1101
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:51,041
So, it’s one sided love. Say it fast

1102
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:51,833
I’ll say.

1103
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,625
You need any help from me?

1104
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:58,166
I don’t need anyone’s help, you first get down
Time is up, I got to drop my lover at office.

1105
01:14:58,208 --> 01:15:00,583
You know what happens if you don’t say it fast?

1106
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:04,791
Your lover will be someone else’s lover
and you are Arya-3 then.

1107
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,875
Will you get down now or not?
- Close your eyes and I’ll be gone

1108
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:10,166
Why didn’t you go?

1109
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:11,750
You didn’t shut your eyes properly

1110
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,416
Shut your eyes properly
- You idiot, go away man.

1111
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:26,666
I don’t need the car in evening.
I’ll go to the hostel along with my friends.

1112
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:27,458
No…

1113
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:29,708
Bro, it is me.

1114
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:33,875
She said not to come in the evening, like you were a driver.
To hell with your life

1115
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:35,666
Varsha, one minute.

1116
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:38,125
Long legs, right?

1117
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:39,916
What again?

1118
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:42,041
Varsha, today...
- Today?

1119
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:43,541
This evening...
- Evening?

1120
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:50,500
Hey, what for you if I smoke?
Did you buy for me or your dad?

1121
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:55,541
If I get him next time, I will burn his face with this.

1122
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:57,083
Waste fellow!
- Ok, cool

1123
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,125
What is that idiot doing here?
- What?

1124
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:01,458
I mean, what is that Rishi doing here?

1125
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:04,625
Oh, same office and I’m observing from few days.

1126
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:08,833
From few days… Few… Be careful with him

1127
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:09,750
Ok.

1128
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,125
Still, why should I care about him? Damn!
- I mean…

1129
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,916
Enough of still looking, go on.

1130
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:38,166
If you had said it at your house with the same speed,
my watchman job wouldn’t be there.

1131
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:42,333
I mean, we are discussing so about how to say at home.

1132
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:48,208
We already reached the second floor, get back to work.

1133
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:49,708
Let’s do it fast, dear.

1134
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:52,291
Let’s do after our parents agree, marriage.

1135
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:54,208
You cleverly escape saying about marriage.

1136
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,625
One kiss, please

1137
01:16:56,791 --> 01:16:59,041
No, positions!

1138
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:03,333
You’re going too much, oh God!

1139
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,208
Hey, are you right here?

1140
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:24,875
Did you see my WhatsApp status?

1141
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:30,000
Wait dude, I’m sad as my share market isn’t
good and you say about your WhatsApp status.

1142
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:34,291
You always torture saying share market.
You remember what is tomorrow?

1143
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:35,791
What?

1144
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:39,500
It’s been six years since you kissed
and proposed in grandfather’s house.

1145
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:43,125
Is it, shall we bunk today then?

1146
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:47,458
Even the share market too isn’t that good.
-Bunking for me or for the share market?

1147
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:51,291
For the kiss
- Look at the face.

1148
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,666
Hey, forgot to say. That Santosh idiot saw you.

1149
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,166
He also asked what you were doing here

1150
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:56,958
My foot!

1151
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:00,083
Move on.

1152
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:08,250
Hey Atmarao, program is about you
- Yes, your honor

1153
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,125
Yes dude, does your souls have any feelings?

1154
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:14,541
Why about me not existing, think about you existing.

1155
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:16,708
You know what she said, driver

1156
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:20,000
That means an employee with monthly salary
- Huh, stop it idiot.

1157
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,250
I should first find out what is that Rishi doing in the office.

1158
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:31,541
Hello brother...
- Hey Gopi, urgent.

1159
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:34,958
What bro, called after so long? Is there any party?

1160
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:40,958
Hey YouTube, not a party
but do you know about Rishi in your office?

1161
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:43,666
Yes, I know bro
- Super

1162
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:46,583
I need full information about Rishi.

1163
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:50,833
Ok bro, I’ll look into that. Bro, party!

1164
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:53,333
You party crazy idiot!

1165
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:56,791
Will you give party even to me if this plan is a success.

1166
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:17,500
Oh no!

1167
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:42,666
Sir, stop. Stop. Show your ID card

1168
01:19:42,666 --> 01:19:44,583
ID card is inside, man, she’s leaving there

1169
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,875
I don’t know all that Sir, show your ID card and then go

1170
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:47,625
No way?

1171
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:48,916
You should take the punishment.

1172
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:14,625
“Shall I come competing and facing you in fun and enjoy?”

1173
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:23,083
“Shall I follow you, behave like you and spend the time?”

1174
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:27,375
“Baby, it feels great when you are with me”

1175
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:31,083
“Time spent with you is so sweet”

1176
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:35,666
“I’m made flat with your talks”

1177
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:39,666
“But my heart is safe with you”

1178
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:48,041
“I love you baby, I want you baby, we should be within each other”

1179
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:56,291
“I love you baby, I told you baby,
I should change like you”

1180
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:17,541
“Your walking style is wow and beauty is a missile”

1181
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:22,000
“I want to stay with you, I want to play with you”
“You just don’t go, life is yoyo”

1182
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,916
“Oath for life time, you are my love fine”

1183
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,666
“I want to live with you,
I want to die with you”

1184
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:29,916
“You have to be all the way”

1185
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:38,083
“Saying to be with you and with no separations”
“Shall we spend making every day as ours?”

1186
01:21:38,083 --> 01:21:42,208
“Being everywhere saying the world is ours”

1187
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:46,041
“Shall we live like love means us?”

1188
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:54,791
“I love you baby, I want you baby,
we should be within each other”

1189
01:21:55,125 --> 01:22:03,208
“I love you baby, I told you baby,
I should change like you”

1190
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:28,375
Get ready at your best, this evening and I’ll give you a surprise

1191
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,000
Is it, let’s see
- Yes

1192
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:32,916
Bye, bye
- Bye

1193
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:39,916
Hey Varsha...

1194
01:22:40,041 --> 01:22:40,750
Oh! He..?

1195
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,541
You got a shock, right?
- No, a surprise

1196
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:47,208
Is it?

1197
01:22:47,416 --> 01:22:48,916
Are you going out, you look to be ready greatly.

1198
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:51,416
No, I’m going in from out.

1199
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,833
In means that side and you going this way…

1200
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:57,416
I’m going out as I have a stomach pain.

1201
01:22:57,666 --> 01:22:59,458
Stomach pain, come on let’s go to Apollo.

1202
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:01,416
No, I’ll be fine by taking a nap.

1203
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:02,791
Are you any mad? Come on, let’s go

1204
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,916
Hey, I said will be fine after a nap, right? You go.

1205
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:11,541
No idea whether there’s water in the hostel or not?

1206
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:12,916
Damn!

1207
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:14,958
My plan has failed.

1208
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,125
Hi...
- Hi

1209
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:28,958
Drive fast..
- Why is that hurry?

1210
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,708
That Santosh idiot will come again, go on

1211
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:31,583
Ok, ok!

1212
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:54,958
Why are you looking like that, dear?

1213
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:57,666
Are you feeling shy?
- Yes

1214
01:23:57,833 --> 01:24:01,916
Why are you feeling shy?
As I’m seeing you so or for eating shamelessly?

1215
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:05,500
Why did you say so, dear?

1216
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,750
What if not? You think surprise means the food, baby?

1217
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:10,125
Yes! Is it not?

1218
01:24:10,708 --> 01:24:11,375
No.

1219
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:17,208
You always say why to waste money and
the same will get double and triple investing on shares, right?

1220
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:21,333
That’s why I’m swallowing this as I can’t expect more than this.

1221
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:24,125
Oh, is it? My foot!

1222
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:25,958
Bearer.

1223
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:33,291
Six years!

1224
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:37,875
This is my successful last gift for our six years love.

1225
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:39,791
Last gift, why is that?

1226
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:44,458
Next year, we will get married right?

1227
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:50,916
Is it a calculator by chance?

1228
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:54,458
Sorry I won’t say so again.

1229
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:56,000
Ok see.

1230
01:24:59,583 --> 01:25:00,208
Cute!

1231
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,458
What is this?

1232
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:09,000
Wow, how much ?

1233
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:13,208
You always shunt saying calculator and shares, right?
I bought with the money I got from those shares

1234
01:25:20,708 --> 01:25:21,750
Ok, shall I do one thing?

1235
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:24,916
I’ll inform the restaurant people that babe
will be here for the whole night and take selfies.

1236
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:30,625
Shall I call even your dad?
You both have the publicity craze, right?

1237
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:34,666
Let’s take photos of you and your dad, then arrange flexes outside.

1238
01:25:35,583 --> 01:25:36,250
Thanks, man.

1239
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:38,208
What if not madam, it’s 10 in the night.

1240
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:39,458
Move fast, I’ll drop you

1241
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:49,083
Thanks

1242
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:57,291
That’s it, no return gift?

1243
01:25:57,583 --> 01:25:58,791
What return gift?

1244
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:01,583
Don’t you know?

1245
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:03,291
I don’t know.

1246
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:04,916
I know.

1247
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:46,541
I said like informing to a kid, did you listen to me?

1248
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:49,125
See now, you turned driver to both.

1249
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:51,166
Damn, you made to lose prestige bro.

1250
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:55,083
Don’t worry, time is up for me.

1251
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:58,083
My final rites are on and I need to go.

1252
01:26:58,541 --> 01:26:59,791
Let’s meet after you die.

1253
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:01,041
All the best.

1254
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,916
What is wrong, why are you like that dear?

1255
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:17,250
Nothing will happen with a kiss, don’t worry.

1256
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:19,208
What, does this look like a comedy for you?

1257
01:27:19,958 --> 01:27:21,750
Hey, what is wrong with her?

1258
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:25,666
No idea, she says I’m doing comedy.
You ask about her comedy

1259
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:30,791
Santosh saw in the car yesterday evening.
I fear what he would do now.

1260
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:33,291
Oh, he said the same just now.

1261
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,458
Then what have you both thought?

1262
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:39,833
We thought, thank God and bad time is gone

1263
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:48,083
What happened?

1264
01:27:56,708 --> 01:27:57,458
Hello Sir.

1265
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:02,875
Hey, why is this fellow here?

1266
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:05,083
Ok Sir!

1267
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:08,458
Madam, Sir is calling you three into the cabin.

1268
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:16,291
Hi guys, he is your team leader from now.

1269
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,541
Please wish him.

1270
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,583
Hi, Rishi...

1271
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:21,833
Bhavana...

1272
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,666
Varsha...

1273
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:31,666
You guys can leave now
- Ok Sir

1274
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:35,750
Look boy, what is your name?

1275
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,291
I am Rishi.

1276
01:28:37,458 --> 01:28:38,208
Rishi..?

1277
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:39,875
You just gave that...

1278
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:42,416
but keep this bag inside.

1279
01:28:43,583 --> 01:28:44,791
Me?
- Yes, you

1280
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:46,541
Ok.

1281
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:55,583
You
- Yes Sir

1282
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:57,541
Go there
- There?

1283
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:58,291
Yes, go.

1284
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:04,916
You! You go there. Why looks, go.

1285
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:30,500
What is the height? Will you be four feet? What?

1286
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,000
Give it here.

1287
01:29:33,291 --> 01:29:34,833
Are you in so much stress?

1288
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:36,708
Where will you go?

1289
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:39,458
You order me Sir
- Great actress!

1290
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:40,541
Sit.

1291
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:48,625
You support them both, right?

1292
01:29:50,041 --> 01:29:51,375
Then why do you need support?

1293
01:29:51,875 --> 01:29:54,416
Yes, get up. Come on get up.

1294
01:29:58,208 --> 01:29:59,000
Do the work.

1295
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:01,291
Chair?

1296
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:03,833
You don’t need a chair for your height.
This position is correct.

1297
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,916
Press it in the gap, ok?

1298
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:09,583
It has started now for you guys.

1299
01:30:12,666 --> 01:30:14,416
Oh no, why did this guy come here?

1300
01:30:18,583 --> 01:30:20,458
How come you are in this office bro, how?

1301
01:30:20,958 --> 01:30:23,833
All get set in Hyderabad with sittings.

1302
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:29,458
If you are seen here
- Again to you, I’ll give you a party.

1303
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,083
What happened now?

1304
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:50,416
It is all because of you.

1305
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,666
What have I done?

1306
01:32:52,208 --> 01:32:54,708
You said return gift that day and he saw it all.

1307
01:32:55,083 --> 01:32:57,333
Oh no, you are supporting your brother in law well.

1308
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:00,708
Hey bro, look at her
- Shut up

1309
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:03,416
I’m already in tension thinking about what he does.

1310
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:04,708
Oh, is it?

1311
01:33:05,541 --> 01:33:06,375
Hey, Sshh!

1312
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,708
What man, looking at me?

1313
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:18,208
That is, listen to me bro. Let’s do as I said for now. Ok, please.

1314
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:22,041
My daddy is asking where I am and asking
whether I haven’t slept. I feel doubtful.

1315
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:24,333
By chance, did that Santosh say anything?

1316
01:33:25,083 --> 01:33:27,541
Your dad says the same every day
and you don’t over imagine.

1317
01:33:27,541 --> 01:33:29,958
Don’t talk too much,
my dad doesn’t ask me daily like this.

1318
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:31,208
Hey, stop it

1319
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:34,333
Not you, but I should cry.

1320
01:33:35,875 --> 01:33:38,208
My legs are swelling by continuously standing.

1321
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:43,541
When the issue here is about you both, I got trapped in between.

1322
01:33:44,916 --> 01:33:49,958
Baby and my boy! You both enjoy your tortures
and leave me. I will take up my own troubles.

1323
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:51,125
Bro, please bro.

1324
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:52,791
All the best.

1325
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:05,041
Ok, fine.

1326
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,333
We are now left with just one option.

1327
01:34:10,666 --> 01:34:11,291
Grandpa!

1328
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:12,416
Grandpa?

1329
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,041
Yes.

1330
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:15,666
If we say our matter to grandpa
and convince him, he’d take care of everything.

1331
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:18,375
We’ll go by morning flight tomorrow
and return back by day after.

1332
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:21,541
These two days are anyways holidays
- What if grandpa doesn’t agree?

1333
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,750
Huh! Let’s convince him.

1334
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:26,250
Let’s convince even by falling on his feet.

1335
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:27,125
Ok?

1336
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:42,125
Hey bro.

1337
01:34:42,958 --> 01:34:45,166
No, call me Bhavana.

1338
01:34:46,416 --> 01:34:48,250
Bha...va...na!

1339
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:49,500
That’s good!

1340
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:01,125
Sir, small doubt!

1341
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:04,750
Can you explain me about JDK JRE and JVM?

1342
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:08,416
The... that’s....

1343
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:09,875
That’s available in GVK.

1344
01:35:09,916 --> 01:35:10,416
Ok?

1345
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:11,541
Why Sir?
- Why Sir?

1346
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:13,500
That’s why.

1347
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,375
What, that’s why Sir?

1348
01:35:15,458 --> 01:35:16,083
That’s why.

1349
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:17,541
What, that’s why Sir?

1350
01:35:17,541 --> 01:35:19,916
Why not ask that next guy, why me?
Are you a back door entry?

1351
01:35:20,041 --> 01:35:23,541
Don’t get jobs with these sittings, dear.
Have the coffee and get married fast.

1352
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:24,583
Oh no!

1353
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:26,083
No, I’d get caught staying here for long.

1354
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,458
She is beautiful, grandpa.

1355
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:53,333
That was just an infatuation grandpa,
mine is pure love with Varsha.

1356
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:56,083
Shut up and say..
- Ok, see.

1357
01:36:08,375 --> 01:36:10,958
Hey get up! Hey get up!

1358
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,250
Bloody three feet.

1359
01:36:17,166 --> 01:36:17,666
Sir!

1360
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:21,750
Thank you Sir

1361
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:26,833
I have no link with them Sir, just friends

1362
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:29,708
Friends?

1363
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:34,041
Sir, not even that now Sir.
- Ok, are you comfortable?

1364
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:35,208
Comfortable!

1365
01:36:49,416 --> 01:36:50,041
Sir!

1366
01:36:50,166 --> 01:36:50,833
Damn!

1367
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,375
A rose for a rose
- Thank you Sir

1368
01:36:59,041 --> 01:36:59,541
Thank you Sir

1369
01:38:45,916 --> 01:38:46,583
Look there...

1370
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:50,208
Night shift for him and day shift for her.

1371
01:38:50,625 --> 01:38:51,666
Climate shift for us!

1372
01:38:55,833 --> 01:38:56,875
Cheers brother!

1373
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,958
You are super Sir!

1374
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:06,041
Super is fine, but evening dinner?

1375
01:39:07,666 --> 01:39:13,791
Dinner, we shall go tomorrow Sir..
because I got to prepare the family at home

1376
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:15,333
Why family preparation?

1377
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:19,458
Because friendship is fine but you are...

1378
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:21,250
You are...

1379
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:27,375
I named Santosh, am going on a date.

1380
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:32,333
It seems grandpa isn’t well Varsha.

1381
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:33,375
Yes.

1382
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:36,291
My parents have gone, did your parents go?

1383
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:38,166
Yes.

1384
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:42,958
No idea what happens, I’m frightened even to come to the office

1385
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:44,833
Hey...

1386
01:39:45,916 --> 01:39:48,041
bro, Santosh out!

1387
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:50,625
What, crazy bro! You are super

1388
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:52,000
Hey, what have you both done?

1389
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:57,000
Hey, come in and I’ll show his face.

1390
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,791
Come.. come.. come...

1391
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:09,083
Sir, ball.

1392
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,041
Squeeze this Sir, tension will come down.

1393
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:14,708
Sir, sir!

1394
01:40:18,666 --> 01:40:20,458
What happened, guys? Say at least now

1395
01:40:20,458 --> 01:40:22,125
Oh, that!
- I’ll say

1396
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:24,083
I with him...

1397
01:40:30,791 --> 01:40:32,750
Can I? I can.

1398
01:40:43,583 --> 01:40:45,916
“You are my Chammak Challo”

1399
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:02,166
Don’t cry dear, I’ll take care.

1400
01:41:02,166 --> 01:41:03,291
Ok Sir.

1401
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:04,000
Please.

1402
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:06,291
What is this?

1403
01:41:07,666 --> 01:41:08,750
I didn’t read this book, Sir.

1404
01:41:09,166 --> 01:41:10,833
Then what is this?
- What is that?

1405
01:41:12,166 --> 01:41:14,708
Sir, I’ve nothing to do. She trapped me Sir .

1406
01:41:14,833 --> 01:41:16,500
No, you don’t say anything to me Santosh.

1407
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:19,625
I’m not accepting this...Please get out
- Please Sir, I beg you Sir.

1408
01:41:19,625 --> 01:41:21,375
Take this and squeeze if needed, Sir, It feels good

1409
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:22,208
- Should I squeeze?

1410
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:23,958
Should I squeeze this?
- Yes Sir, it feels good

1411
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,625
Sir
- Get lost

1412
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:32,125
Alright! So, why are you waiting here? Go and enjoy

1413
01:41:32,541 --> 01:41:34,041
I named Santosh! Yeah!

1414
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:37,833
Thank God
- Move on

1415
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:40,833
They’ve completely ruined my prestige that day.

1416
01:41:41,916 --> 01:41:44,291
Some duffers at office uploaded it all on Facebook.

1417
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:50,791
My dad came to know about that and said I’m unfit in life
for politics and here I’ve been going around for deaths and eating there.

1418
01:41:51,541 --> 01:41:55,125
Grandson, whatever happening
in life should be taken for our good.

1419
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,625
Not our good, but for my good.

1420
01:41:57,916 --> 01:42:00,333
A good thing happened after that.

1421
01:42:02,625 --> 01:42:05,333
I feel you’ve done a bit too much in Santosh’s matter.

1422
01:42:05,416 --> 01:42:08,500
My foot! But why are you feeling so much for him?

1423
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:15,291
Not about him, but what if he goes to my
parents with his parents and proposes to marry me?

1424
01:42:15,666 --> 01:42:16,666
What if my dad agrees?

1425
01:42:17,125 --> 01:42:18,375
They’d ask you and go ahead, right?

1426
01:42:19,791 --> 01:42:21,666
Then say, you’d marry Rishi.

1427
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:23,791
They’d slap me tight.

1428
01:42:25,666 --> 01:42:26,458
Why is that?

1429
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:30,333
My daddy doesn’t have a good opinion on your parents.

1430
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,958
The same would carry on even on you, right?

1431
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:36,375
Hey, say what exactly you wish to say.

1432
01:42:36,458 --> 01:42:43,875
I don’t know anything. Often when your topic comes,
I heard my daddy saying you people are very selfish and greedy for money.

1433
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:46,583
I’m thus saying he may not agree.

1434
01:42:47,375 --> 01:42:48,416
Is it so?

1435
01:42:48,708 --> 01:42:50,083
None can notice their own mistakes.

1436
01:42:50,541 --> 01:42:55,708
Not just my parents but you, me and everyone knows
that your daddy has money and publicity craze.

1437
01:42:56,333 --> 01:43:00,041
Stop it now Rishi, I just posted the
matter that they are thinking so.

1438
01:43:00,416 --> 01:43:01,958
I haven’t said anything about your parents.

1439
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,625
I’ll say, I’ll say directly.

1440
01:43:03,791 --> 01:43:05,833
It’s better that your dad brings down his blabbering.

1441
01:43:06,166 --> 01:43:08,916
Please! Anyone would behave based on the others.

1442
01:43:09,083 --> 01:43:11,875
Leave about my Daddy, how many times did your mummy…

1443
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:12,791
Damn!

1444
01:43:13,166 --> 01:43:14,958
I know how she spoke bad about me.

1445
01:43:15,583 --> 01:43:17,083
Don’t unnecessarily blame my parents.

1446
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:22,125
Oh no! After saying it all, you too are
saying like your dad with a comment what have you said

1447
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,541
Hey, remember!

1448
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:27,750
You just said, right? We should behave
based on the opposite people.

1449
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:31,166
You should be as per my parents after we get married.

1450
01:43:31,916 --> 01:43:33,666
You will be in my house after we are married.

1451
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:36,708
Why would I be, Rishi?

1452
01:43:37,166 --> 01:43:40,041
I’m coming to your house for you and not for them.

1453
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,333
Oh no, what now?
I’ve been saying you from childhood.

1454
01:43:44,875 --> 01:43:47,625
We should all be together after
our marriage and that would be so great.

1455
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:49,958
We will be with my parents, right?

1456
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:54,208
Yes, I too will feel the same to be with my parents.

1457
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,000
But none is so now

1458
01:43:56,250 --> 01:44:00,333
Ok, leave all that.
Will you be in my house with my parents?

1459
01:44:00,583 --> 01:44:02,083
Damn it, I can’t be with those people.

1460
01:44:02,916 --> 01:44:04,958
Mine too is the same situation and I too can’t be.

1461
01:44:05,125 --> 01:44:07,625
Conjuse lives eating those dishes saved in the fridge.

1462
01:44:07,708 --> 01:44:11,041
Hey, don’t talk too much..
like you’re down from the heavens.

1463
01:44:11,416 --> 01:44:12,416
Hey, stop it now.

1464
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:13,583
You and your family!

1465
01:44:35,666 --> 01:44:37,250
Will you always be on that phone?

1466
01:44:38,333 --> 01:44:39,541
Not me, but you.

1467
01:44:39,916 --> 01:44:42,708
I don’t like this thing.
Learn to listen when something is said for good.

1468
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:44,833
I can see future with you, Rishi.

1469
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:47,041
It won’t set for us both, get out.

1470
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:12,875
“Mistake or hesitation but got separated”

1471
01:45:12,875 --> 01:45:17,666
“Pain came up in the story not written by fate”

1472
01:45:17,666 --> 01:45:22,458
“Smile has bid a bye while leaving”

1473
01:45:22,458 --> 01:45:27,083
“My life is gone away from me”

1474
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:31,750
“Just the pain is with me”

1475
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:41,416
“The word us has become meaningless”
“Separated now as you and me”

1476
01:45:56,041 --> 01:46:00,541
“This vacuum is my friend now”

1477
01:46:00,916 --> 01:46:05,500
“It is in the heart as a companion”

1478
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:10,125
“Fun has become an insult”

1479
01:46:10,416 --> 01:46:14,833
“I moved on as a moving surprise”

1480
01:46:15,041 --> 01:46:19,916
“Arrow hit when left after aiming”

1481
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:23,916
“Will the wound at heart heal?”

1482
01:46:24,791 --> 01:46:33,875
“My life is gone away from me”
“Just the pain is with me”

1483
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:10,208
“My breathe turned into a cyclone”
“It blew you far away in anger”

1484
01:47:10,458 --> 01:47:14,708
“Your thoughts are shaking me”

1485
01:47:15,125 --> 01:47:19,708
“I’ve moved around going mad”

1486
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:29,416
“Tears don’t listen when said not to come”
“All the dreams melted and are showering”

1487
01:47:29,625 --> 01:47:38,916
“This weeping is become my world”
“It ended all my hopes”

1488
01:47:42,375 --> 01:47:47,333
I’m just happy as they broke up and why do you come now
and ask me to get them along again, grandpa?

1489
01:47:47,833 --> 01:47:51,458
It’s better to do Mixing Lemon rice at Erragadda roads
instead of making them come along.

1490
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:55,333
Oh no, I feel awkward remembering about that car flashback.

1491
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:55,875
Damn!

1492
01:47:56,666 --> 01:47:58,416
I loved so much, grandpa.

1493
01:47:58,666 --> 01:48:01,541
I loved your granddaughter so much that I pity myself.

1494
01:48:01,875 --> 01:48:04,166
See, it is Varsha’s photo even in my purse.

1495
01:48:05,125 --> 01:48:09,416
Her photo is with you all over,
but she should be having your photo right?

1496
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:12,625
Look, you made me a fool saying such logics till now.
It’s too much, enough now

1497
01:48:13,333 --> 01:48:14,125
Santosh!

1498
01:48:14,416 --> 01:48:15,208
Santosh!

1499
01:48:16,458 --> 01:48:20,666
If you now believe on what I’m going to say,
come home along with me.

1500
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:26,333
Otherwise, come for the dinner
without forgetting on my 11th day.

1501
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:35,666
I wished to say the important incident from
my life which I never shared with anyone.

1502
01:48:36,125 --> 01:48:40,250
and then take Santosh home along with me.

1503
01:48:41,041 --> 01:48:46,500
Because I don’t have the time now
after death which I had when alive.

1504
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:52,333
I loved a girl when I and your grandpa
studied in Hyderabad.

1505
01:48:52,708 --> 01:48:54,958
Grandpa, love right in those days?

1506
01:48:55,291 --> 01:48:56,083
Yes

1507
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,875
But that girl went home suddenly, giving up her studies.

1508
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:03,666
But still, we never stopped writing letters.

1509
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:28,750
When we were happy like that,
she wrote saying her parents are getting her married...

1510
01:49:28,958 --> 01:49:34,291
they aren’t caring about her word even
when said and that it would be her last letter.

1511
01:49:34,833 --> 01:49:40,708
With that I couldn’t be there, came back to our village,
started a Rice Mill with the help of a few and lived happily.

1512
01:49:41,208 --> 01:49:45,375
My family members didn’t let me be happy and got me married.

1513
01:49:46,125 --> 01:49:53,291
Why I said they didn’t let me be happy was that even my wife
didn’t stay long with me and died after some time of marriage.

1514
01:49:54,125 --> 01:49:56,166
When I was living so, one day…
- Post!

1515
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:05,791
I started in tension after reading that letter.

1516
01:50:06,416 --> 01:50:10,333
I couldn’t believe myself after seeing Neelima,
my love in that condition.

1517
01:50:11,875 --> 01:50:20,708
Saying to have none to take care, Neelima handed
over her daughter to me and breathed her last.

1518
01:50:23,458 --> 01:50:27,000
From that moment, I decided to be having two children.

1519
01:50:28,291 --> 01:50:38,000
Granddaughter of my love Neelima, Varsha and my grandson
Rishi came to me and asked to get them married as they are in love.

1520
01:50:38,458 --> 01:50:44,750
I felt my memories from old days are coming true
and I somehow wished to get them together.

1521
01:50:45,291 --> 01:50:46,708
After listening to you now...

1522
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:51,750
I understood that my kids effect is showing impact even on their kids.

1523
01:50:52,833 --> 01:51:01,041
In such conditions when you say now to leave
after helping so much, I feel my life so far is a waste.

1524
01:51:02,666 --> 01:51:07,625
Because I always winning when alive...

1525
01:51:09,458 --> 01:51:15,666
am losing now after death like this and
my soul is weeping for the same, grandson!

1526
01:51:16,125 --> 01:51:18,625
You won’t lose grandpa, don’t say so.

1527
01:51:19,291 --> 01:51:22,291
I understood what to do.
Come on, let’s go home

1528
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:39,791
Grandpa, you are a love failure and I too am a love failure.

1529
01:51:41,625 --> 01:51:46,666
Murali, priest said to get in at the mill.
Nothing should go wrong in what is being done for Raju

1530
01:51:46,666 --> 01:51:47,666
Careful.

1531
01:51:58,083 --> 01:51:59,375
Where were you for the whole day, yesterday?

1532
01:52:01,416 --> 01:52:04,750
Say that we had toddy
- No, do we say all that to him?

1533
01:52:05,916 --> 01:52:07,708
What man, behaving mad? Did you drink or what?

1534
01:52:07,708 --> 01:52:10,208
No father in law, I just went around the village. I didn’t drink

1535
01:52:10,333 --> 01:52:12,125
It’s smelling, go and brush
- Ok, I will brush

1536
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:15,333
You are saved as my father in law expired.
-Oh, he’s just leaving.

1537
01:52:15,333 --> 01:52:16,333
He’s gone.

1538
01:52:23,333 --> 01:52:24,750
Where are you going?

1539
01:52:24,875 --> 01:52:26,916
We are going to disperse father in law’s ashes.
We will come tomorrow

1540
01:52:26,916 --> 01:52:27,625
Rest in peace

1541
01:52:27,625 --> 01:52:29,833
What, rest in peace?
- Oh, happy journey

1542
01:52:30,333 --> 01:52:31,583
Go uncle, go
- You rascal

1543
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:44,625
Are you ready, grandpa?

1544
01:52:47,416 --> 01:52:50,916
Enough of that feeling,
did you think of anything in this gap?

1545
01:52:51,708 --> 01:52:55,166
Yes, I’m thinking how to start the same.

1546
01:52:55,333 --> 01:52:57,833
You know the present range of your grand children now?

1547
01:52:58,416 --> 01:53:01,541
You won’t understand if I say like this,
wait let me show you in practical now.

1548
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:10,041
This is Varsha’s toy and as per our narration,
this is a time bomb.

1549
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:13,458
I’ll keep this there, you see how it blasts.

1550
01:53:16,708 --> 01:53:17,375
Hey!

1551
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:19,833
Come on! See now.

1552
01:53:41,125 --> 01:53:42,541
Hey, what are you doing?

1553
01:53:43,916 --> 01:53:45,791
Do you have any sense?
Why are you touching mine?

1554
01:53:46,333 --> 01:53:47,500
It was me who bought it for you.

1555
01:53:47,916 --> 01:53:48,541
Is it?

1556
01:53:48,875 --> 01:53:52,000
You bought this for me? Then, I’ll tear it out and…

1557
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:05,416
Grandpa, what you saw was just the first half.
Now comes the second half, see.

1558
01:54:15,291 --> 01:54:16,125
Varsha...

1559
01:54:18,833 --> 01:54:19,541
What is this?

1560
01:54:19,875 --> 01:54:21,500
Hole, can’t you see?

1561
01:54:22,166 --> 01:54:25,041
Don’t talk like a kid as if you don’t know.
I’m asking why did you do it.

1562
01:54:25,125 --> 01:54:28,750
Hey, look at the hole. It came very even, right?

1563
01:54:28,791 --> 01:54:31,958
Stop all these dirty plays and say why you did it

1564
01:54:32,125 --> 01:54:34,291
My laptop and it’s my wish
- What?

1565
01:54:36,541 --> 01:54:37,416
Bill is mine.

1566
01:54:39,083 --> 01:54:40,583
I’ll hit with this if you talk too much.

1567
01:54:41,125 --> 01:54:44,458
Hey, I’ll press your neck and kill.
You hit me with the laptop?

1568
01:54:44,458 --> 01:54:46,500
You think I can’t press?
- You…

1569
01:54:47,208 --> 01:54:49,958
You... scratched me.
- You said the toy was yours right, idiot? It’ll be the same

1570
01:54:49,958 --> 01:54:53,208
If you say me idiot again, I’ll
- Hey stop it

1571
01:54:55,125 --> 01:54:58,125
It’s become a job for me to always stop
when you and your parents are into fight.

1572
01:54:58,375 --> 01:55:00,083
Be good at least till they are back

1573
01:55:00,541 --> 01:55:03,500
Why are they worst than their parents?

1574
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:06,833
Oh, you didn’t like my love story
and they are like Romeo and Juliet for you.

1575
01:55:07,125 --> 01:55:10,041
Yes man, go and remind them about their love once.

1576
01:55:10,041 --> 01:55:12,625
Don’t know about reminding them, but I remember my love story.

1577
01:55:12,708 --> 01:55:14,458
You know, my love story is of Arjun Reddy range.

1578
01:55:14,958 --> 01:55:18,583
My foot! Go and say to marry my granddaughter.

1579
01:55:19,958 --> 01:55:21,500
What grandpa, won’t you let me be good?

1580
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:23,541
Your entire family is using me like
the stuff in drink session.

1581
01:55:24,291 --> 01:55:26,375
The guy doing what he says is the leader.

1582
01:55:26,875 --> 01:55:30,041
Yes, I’ll become a politician as and when you say?
Such dirty tricks won’t work on me.

1583
01:55:30,041 --> 01:55:30,583
Hello!

1584
01:55:32,833 --> 01:55:34,416
Oh no, emotion!

1585
01:55:34,666 --> 01:55:35,916
Is this emotional blackmail? Hello!

1586
01:55:38,583 --> 01:55:40,708
Don’t put that face grandpa, I’ll go and say.

1587
01:55:47,083 --> 01:55:47,916
My laptop.

1588
01:55:59,625 --> 01:56:00,375
Head phones

1589
01:56:01,625 --> 01:56:02,625
Thanks
- Pleasure

1590
01:56:06,208 --> 01:56:06,791
What?

1591
01:56:08,541 --> 01:56:09,083
Varsha!

1592
01:56:10,250 --> 01:56:11,708
Varsha
- Yes, tell me.

1593
01:56:12,875 --> 01:56:13,708
Will you marry me?

1594
01:56:17,333 --> 01:56:18,166
Super!

1595
01:56:18,791 --> 01:56:21,375
I said so as you broke up with him.

1596
01:56:22,625 --> 01:56:24,166
Come on, go and marry him.

1597
01:56:24,875 --> 01:56:25,500
No, don’t hit

1598
01:56:26,125 --> 01:56:27,666
Brother in law, you wait .
- No problem, no need.

1599
01:56:28,208 --> 01:56:28,708
It's ok.

1600
01:56:29,166 --> 01:56:30,500
I’ll marry you.

1601
01:56:34,291 --> 01:56:35,500
You go and convince my father.

1602
01:56:35,666 --> 01:56:36,666
Are you crack?

1603
01:56:37,666 --> 01:56:38,875
I meant, is it so.

1604
01:56:40,958 --> 01:56:43,583
Dirty rascal is laughing even when I said to marry.

1605
01:56:44,125 --> 01:56:47,041
Brother in law, wait. Open the door.

1606
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:51,166
Grandpa, is your granddaughter crack?
She says to marry me.

1607
01:56:51,458 --> 01:56:52,666
What, you?
- Yes, me

1608
01:56:52,916 --> 01:56:55,000
I’ll be banged being in between them now.

1609
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,916
Hey, stop rascal
- Oh no

1610
01:56:56,958 --> 01:56:59,166
You are dead in my hands today
- What rascal, what?

1611
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:00,541
What shall I do with them, man?

1612
01:57:00,875 --> 01:57:03,875
Why do you care about whom I marry?
- Yes, why do I care?

1613
01:57:04,125 --> 01:57:05,916
He’s correct for you, marry him.

1614
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:09,250
Yes, we should do the same when idiots like you cheat.

1615
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:10,416
Who cheated you?

1616
01:57:10,416 --> 01:57:13,375
You said it, right? Your future is visible and next…

1617
01:57:13,541 --> 01:57:15,458
You say we shall be just like cousins?

1618
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:17,208
What all did you say then?

1619
01:57:17,208 --> 01:57:18,708
Didn’t you say me nonsense?

1620
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:20,000
I’ll say when you say me.

1621
01:57:20,375 --> 01:57:24,500
Oh, is it? What did you say when
my parents asked about marriage, recently?

1622
01:57:25,041 --> 01:57:31,833
When my parents made me sit the day before and said
we get the mill by marrying you, I said no as I didn’t like that.

1623
01:57:32,875 --> 01:57:34,625
You are shouting like a buffalo without knowing all that

1624
01:57:34,708 --> 01:57:35,916
Hey, if you say me buffalo…

1625
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:39,291
Yes.

1626
01:57:40,375 --> 01:57:42,666
I heard my dad saying about mill with my mom

1627
01:57:42,833 --> 01:57:45,833
They’re getting us married for property and not for us.

1628
01:58:00,833 --> 01:58:01,750
Sorry, dear.

1629
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:04,333
you too say sorry.

1630
01:58:06,458 --> 01:58:07,208
I love you.

1631
01:58:13,375 --> 01:58:15,791
Why is the atmosphere so silent

1632
01:58:16,375 --> 01:58:18,791
Yes grandpa, it shouldn’t be like this.

1633
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:21,208
By mistake did they stab each other and die?

1634
01:58:21,208 --> 01:58:22,208
Come on grandpa, let’s go and see.

1635
01:58:31,625 --> 01:58:34,416
Close the door, our plan is a success.

1636
01:58:35,166 --> 01:58:39,000
Thank God, one job is done
- Thank God, one problem is cleared

1637
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:40,916
Yes, right!
- Yes, right!

1638
01:58:40,916 --> 01:58:44,375
Grandpa, you’d have finished a full bottle if alive today, right?

1639
01:58:44,458 --> 01:58:47,916
Come on grandson, I’m always in two pegs…
- Two

1640
01:58:48,541 --> 01:58:49,416
What happened?

1641
01:58:49,583 --> 01:58:52,416
We forgot about that Kothem fellow in hurry
- Who is that Kothem fellow?

1642
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:53,291
Come on, I’ll show you.

1643
01:58:54,333 --> 01:58:57,916
I’ll be gone till the mill and come back dear
- Brother, have breakfast and go.

1644
01:59:00,291 --> 01:59:00,958
Rishi!

1645
01:59:06,666 --> 01:59:09,208
They were fighting even just before, brother.

1646
01:59:09,666 --> 01:59:13,541
Our Raju would’ve felt so happy seeing you both, like this.

1647
01:59:15,958 --> 01:59:20,750
No idea how much you took by asking grandpa to get you married...

1648
01:59:21,083 --> 01:59:26,000
but he took it up as his last wish to somehow get you married.

1649
01:59:30,083 --> 01:59:30,666
But...

1650
01:59:31,875 --> 01:59:36,375
finally he passed away without seeing your marriage.

1651
02:00:00,041 --> 02:00:04,958
Why do you see so, master?
Drink it fast. I should drink here, when you drink there.

1652
02:00:05,916 --> 02:00:06,708
That means you...

1653
02:00:11,041 --> 02:00:13,208
He is in the same position from when Raju sir died, sir.

1654
02:00:13,875 --> 02:00:17,708
He places a glass in front and
asks to drink and he drinks it too again.

1655
02:00:18,166 --> 02:00:19,166
Hey, go

1656
02:00:19,166 --> 02:00:22,375
Hey, will your master be happy by
sitting here and drinking?

1657
02:00:22,375 --> 02:00:24,541
Or will he feel happy by celebrating his 11th day well?

1658
02:00:25,375 --> 02:00:28,000
I can’t come to the house without master.

1659
02:00:28,125 --> 02:00:31,291
Why, isn’t anybody home if he isn’t there?
Everyone is asking about you there.

1660
02:00:31,625 --> 02:00:36,333
Whoever has asked, it was just him for me. I can’t come, Sir.

1661
02:00:37,583 --> 02:00:42,125
In the process to set right my kids,
I forgot you being like my son.

1662
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:44,250
Please forgive me, Kothem.

1663
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:49,833
When he’s feeling like a son about you,
you like a waste fellow are sitting here and drinking.

1664
02:00:50,458 --> 02:00:52,333
Are you not from this village, sir?

1665
02:00:52,875 --> 02:00:55,250
I don’t understand what you are saying

1666
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:56,916
Let’s think of that after going home.

1667
02:00:58,458 --> 02:00:59,833
Come on

1668
02:01:00,166 --> 02:01:00,750
You move now, come on move
- I won’t come

1669
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:02,166
Help me grandpa! Oh, you can’t help, right?

1670
02:01:02,708 --> 02:01:04,250
Everything went on well, mother in law.

1671
02:01:05,208 --> 02:01:08,583
Sir, have it.
- Hey Kothem, where were you all these days?

1672
02:01:09,208 --> 02:01:14,958
He came this morning.
When asked where he was, he stood silent just like this.

1673
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:20,208
Grandpa.

1674
02:01:25,375 --> 02:01:28,000
They are so good with dad’s photo, right?

1675
02:01:28,250 --> 02:01:30,666
-Good if they agree for the marriage

1676
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:37,875
All these are saying it’s good if you agree for marriage, by seeing you.

1677
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,708
Why don’t you think a bit about that?

1678
02:01:41,708 --> 02:01:42,375
We like it.

1679
02:01:45,333 --> 02:01:46,875
You won’t start a new mess again, right?

1680
02:01:48,041 --> 02:01:50,875
We aren’t agreeing for you, but for grandpa.

1681
02:01:53,916 --> 02:01:56,208
Our Somaraju’s dream is coming true.

1682
02:01:56,458 --> 02:02:01,375
Don’t let the 11th day of the guy who always
lived in smiles and made others smile, being in tears.

1683
02:02:01,625 --> 02:02:05,750
Let’s celebrate it as a festival and give farewell with satisfaction.

1684
02:02:08,125 --> 02:02:09,750
This is the story of my soul.

1685
02:02:10,458 --> 02:02:17,333
When my family is thinking to celebrate my
11th day in grandeur, I’m going to see from close.

1686
02:02:17,708 --> 02:02:18,750
You too join me

1687
02:02:38,666 --> 02:02:42,708
“Human’s birth is great”

1688
02:02:43,083 --> 02:02:45,625
“One has to be gone back again”

1689
02:02:45,958 --> 02:02:50,875
“Life in between runs like a story”

1690
02:02:51,708 --> 02:02:57,458
“In the life journey on the earth”
“So many roles on the way ahead”

1691
02:02:57,458 --> 02:03:02,625
“Your story becomes past history in this journey and becomes sacred”

1692
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:08,666
“It’s a great pain when our close ones pass away”

1693
02:03:08,666 --> 02:03:14,583
“We can’t change the fate and Bhagavad-Gita is finally played”

1694
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:21,916
“To fulfil the bond, to get closer and to end this”

1695
02:03:21,916 --> 02:03:27,833
“Celebration carried out at the place where you lived on”

1696
02:03:27,833 --> 02:03:33,750
“All should come together and give mourning”

1697
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:39,625
“Life is the puppet game with smiles and tears”

1698
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:10,833
“Either we salute or put garlands”
“It shows you stand in our hearts”

1699
02:04:10,833 --> 02:04:18,250
“Either we offer food or do the final rites”
“It shows we remember your hunger”

1700
02:04:18,833 --> 02:04:24,500
“The water with sesame seeds being dropped”
“Are the final farewell for you”

1701
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:30,875
“Memories won’t be gone, eyes are wet remembering you”

1702
02:04:30,875 --> 02:04:36,666
“You are in our hearts alive forever”

1703
02:04:36,916 --> 02:04:42,500
“The celebration being done
at the place you lived on”

1704
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:48,583
“All should come together and give mourning”

1705
02:04:48,583 --> 02:04:54,291
“Life is the puppet game with smiles and tears”

1706
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:11,750
You witnessed my happiness, right?

1707
02:05:12,458 --> 02:05:18,125
I reading and smiling the text saying
even death is similar to the marriage...

1708
02:05:19,375 --> 02:05:25,125
When my death is celebrated like a festival
and are sending me away happily...

1709
02:05:26,791 --> 02:05:31,041
I’ll go happily witnessing the happiness of my beloved ones.

1710
02:05:32,416 --> 02:05:34,625
What more do a man like me need than this?

1711
02:05:34,833 --> 02:05:38,458
Dad always used to make us laugh.
Do you remember, Papa?

1712
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:41,166
In childhood, once we were studying power was gone.

1713
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:45,291
Dad took great risk, lit a big fire and asked us to study in that light.

1714
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:48,875
Power came in immediately and we should have seen dad’s face then.

1715
02:05:51,625 --> 02:05:54,875
He didn’t let us study that day in anger after that

1716
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,041
What happened, brother in law?

1717
02:06:17,666 --> 02:06:19,000
You know what your father did?

1718
02:06:19,166 --> 02:06:19,791
Look...

1719
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:27,750
I’m taking this decision with the feeling
that my kids are happy with what I gave them.

1720
02:06:28,583 --> 02:06:32,541
Rice Mill starting as mine came this far as ours.

1721
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:38,958
So, I feel this is the hard work from many hands
and feel them also as my family...

1722
02:06:39,958 --> 02:06:48,250
I considering my kids, grandchildren and
the labor, I’m giving equal rights to one and all.

1723
02:06:49,166 --> 02:06:54,625
Importantly, I’d say all are equal share holders
and none has a right to sell it.

1724
02:06:55,625 --> 02:07:02,500
This is the document I’m writing in stable mental
and health condition with my own hands.

1725
02:07:02,666 --> 02:07:03,458
Finally...

1726
02:07:04,375 --> 02:07:05,750
You know what he did with this house?

1727
02:07:06,375 --> 02:07:09,000
It seems this house is for him
and we are all waste fellows.

1728
02:07:09,333 --> 02:07:11,458
I haven’t written like that
- That means...

1729
02:07:11,875 --> 02:07:13,291
It seems he’ll be in this house...

1730
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:16,791
and we shall come during festivals here
and leave having good dinners.

1731
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,916
Let’s go and ask what exactly the matter is

1732
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,791
That lawyer fellow has informed me about all this.

1733
02:07:27,208 --> 02:07:29,500
Anyone would write concentrating on the pen he writes...

1734
02:07:29,625 --> 02:07:32,208
but this old man wrote all this nonsense
being in drink brother in law.

1735
02:07:35,875 --> 02:07:37,458
You first say what you did.

1736
02:07:37,750 --> 02:07:40,583
Don’t spread the matter to be
told as a good deed like a poison to all.

1737
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,708
You wait mom, you know nothing.

1738
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:47,916
We, not having the time to take care of the mill thought
to sell the rice mill for Rishi and Varsha’s marriage.

1739
02:07:57,750 --> 02:07:58,750
What uncle...

1740
02:07:59,708 --> 02:08:03,125
running to close the doors as your
friend’s prestige shouldn’t be gone?

1741
02:08:07,208 --> 02:08:09,208
You don’t care about what happens to us and our children.

1742
02:08:10,125 --> 02:08:13,416
If you really can’t listen to my words,
remove that machine in ears uncle.

1743
02:08:15,291 --> 02:08:17,791
Sir, master wrote like that means...
- Hey...

1744
02:08:18,541 --> 02:08:20,750
You too are getting to talk after
knowing that the house is for you?

1745
02:08:21,041 --> 02:08:24,000
I already said we won’t get these properties with us,
right? Why not send away grandpa happily?

1746
02:08:24,291 --> 02:08:24,875
Shut up.

1747
02:08:28,041 --> 02:08:28,666
Murali!

1748
02:08:35,708 --> 02:08:37,125
Why do you care about them, grandson?

1749
02:08:38,166 --> 02:08:40,250
It is proved that they are idiots, right?

1750
02:08:40,708 --> 02:08:44,333
Those who still wish to talk can silent get out, opening the doors.

1751
02:08:51,333 --> 02:08:55,416
Sir, it’s getting late and the rites need to be done faster.

1752
02:08:59,416 --> 02:09:03,625
If you feel that we are the reason for all this,
we’d never come again towards this house.

1753
02:09:04,083 --> 02:09:09,541
Look, let’s discuss all these later.
It is getting late, come on son, come.

1754
02:09:10,083 --> 02:09:14,666
Oh! When we are in so much pain and
if you still feel his final rites are important, then move on..

1755
02:09:14,916 --> 02:09:16,958
Come on ...
- Dad, dad stop

1756
02:09:18,208 --> 02:09:20,333
What was grandpa’s mistake?
- Mistake!

1757
02:09:20,625 --> 02:09:22,791
He made you, me and all on the roads.

1758
02:09:22,958 --> 02:09:24,916
On the roads means not to give that mill?

1759
02:09:24,916 --> 02:09:29,041
Hey Rishi, all this is for you right?
Why are you shouting?

1760
02:09:29,458 --> 02:09:30,291
What to shout?

1761
02:09:30,916 --> 02:09:32,333
Yes, all this is for me.

1762
02:09:32,666 --> 02:09:36,166
You get us both married if said to give the mill
and show affections among yourselves?

1763
02:09:36,375 --> 02:09:40,250
If that isn’t there, you say not to go to mother in law’s house,
not to talk saying they cry seeing our status?

1764
02:09:41,791 --> 02:09:43,625
What mother in law, you cry seeing our status?

1765
02:09:47,666 --> 02:09:49,500
I and Varsha are in love from childhood.

1766
02:09:53,583 --> 02:09:56,125
Yes, when you are in such behaviours
why would we say you?

1767
02:09:57,458 --> 02:10:00,041
That’s why we asked grandpa to get us married.

1768
02:10:02,583 --> 02:10:06,375
But, we witnessed all your dramas
before agreeing for our marriage.

1769
02:10:06,708 --> 02:10:09,958
Yes, my dad always used to scold
father in law and mother in law.

1770
02:10:10,375 --> 02:10:10,791
Damn!

1771
02:10:11,083 --> 02:10:14,791
You said to get me married to Santosh brother in law as
he has more money and now saying to give me to Rishi.

1772
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,791
No idea what you do to me by getting more money in future.

1773
02:10:16,916 --> 02:10:18,333
Hey, what are you talking
- Stop this

1774
02:10:22,416 --> 02:10:28,833
Though you were creating so much mess all these days,
I kept quiet for my dad as I’m not his own daughter...

1775
02:10:29,458 --> 02:10:31,625
They would hate if I still keep quiet.

1776
02:10:32,750 --> 02:10:37,750
If you wish to say even a word to my father,
I’d think to have only a daughter from now.

1777
02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:39,916
Oh, then you and your daughter die right here.

1778
02:10:44,625 --> 02:10:49,541
Hey, is your grandpa more than us
for you as he said ok for your marriage?

1779
02:10:51,166 --> 02:10:54,083
So, whatever we did thinking about your future is all a waste?

1780
02:10:55,041 --> 02:10:55,958
I don’t say waste.

1781
02:10:56,625 --> 02:10:59,250
I’m saying that you are just giving us the money but not people.

1782
02:10:59,958 --> 02:11:03,333
Hey Rishi, you’ll have no value without having that money.

1783
02:11:03,958 --> 02:11:04,500
Is it?

1784
02:11:05,166 --> 02:11:07,708
Day before, I and Chandraiah grandpa
went to invite everyone in the village for this day

1785
02:11:08,708 --> 02:11:13,750
The respect I got there as Somaraju’s grandson,
none would give that to you or me in the city, dad.

1786
02:11:14,291 --> 02:11:16,291
Who are you and who am I, if grandfather is not there?

1787
02:11:16,375 --> 02:11:16,791
Hey...

1788
02:11:17,375 --> 02:11:19,625
your grandpa taught you to speak great.

1789
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,375
Then, you stay back here and do whatever you want.

1790
02:11:22,666 --> 02:11:23,500
We are leaving.

1791
02:11:24,083 --> 02:11:24,750
Come on.

1792
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:26,666
Murali...
- Brother

1793
02:11:35,541 --> 02:11:37,041
I’ll do the offerings for grandpa

1794
02:11:40,666 --> 02:11:42,125
Hey Rishi, stop
- Stop son.

1795
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:43,958
Stop
-Stop Rishi

1796
02:11:50,333 --> 02:11:51,375
It’s all over

1797
02:11:53,208 --> 02:11:57,958
What I need is not that small offering from them.

1798
02:12:00,041 --> 02:12:02,208
But, my entire family to be together

1799
02:12:05,125 --> 02:12:14,125
Anyone living in imagination that his children are very happy
can never leave the world in peace and cross river 'Vaitharani'.

1800
02:12:15,458 --> 02:12:16,083
Grandpa...

1801
02:12:17,333 --> 02:12:21,208
I’m getting to cry seeing you like this.

1802
02:12:24,541 --> 02:12:26,541
You are a lucky man, dear.

1803
02:12:28,166 --> 02:12:31,083
If I get a chance to be alive for five minutes...

1804
02:12:33,208 --> 02:12:35,541
I wish to cry like my tears are visible.

1805
02:12:38,583 --> 02:12:39,458
Rishi, stop.

1806
02:12:39,708 --> 02:12:41,625
Rishi, what you are doing is wrong.

1807
02:12:42,250 --> 02:12:45,625
When dad isn’t doing the offerings to grandpa,
what’s wrong that I offer as his grandson?

1808
02:12:56,125 --> 02:12:57,666
Priest Sir, please start.

1809
02:12:57,916 --> 02:13:01,041
You shouldn’t do this when your father is alive, son.

1810
02:13:01,708 --> 02:13:02,958
No problem, please go on.

1811
02:13:04,666 --> 02:13:05,916
(Chants)

1812
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:35,833
Hey Rishi!

1813
02:13:36,750 --> 02:13:38,291
You know what you are doing?

1814
02:13:40,958 --> 02:13:42,666
Hey, get up and come, we shall go

1815
02:13:46,666 --> 02:13:47,625
(Chants)

1816
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:49,250
Rishi....

1817
02:13:51,416 --> 02:13:55,791
See brother in law, all here are watching not
saying that what Rishi is doing is wrong.

1818
02:13:56,291 --> 02:13:57,416
It is a waste for us to be here.

1819
02:13:57,958 --> 02:13:58,375
Move.

1820
02:13:58,458 --> 02:14:00,125
Please, you don’t talk.

1821
02:14:00,166 --> 02:14:04,166
The minute you spoke bad about our Raju Sir,
you are no more the son in law for our village.

1822
02:14:06,625 --> 02:14:08,583
Latha, come on let’s go.

1823
02:14:13,958 --> 02:14:15,750
There’s none to understand us here.

1824
02:14:16,958 --> 02:14:19,791
Even the dogs in the village will bark seeing us after this.

1825
02:14:23,833 --> 02:14:28,291
Hey, instead of doing so and ruining our prestige,
do the offerings with your own hands...

1826
02:14:28,291 --> 02:14:29,958
even for us and then happily enjoy with the whole village.

1827
02:14:31,958 --> 02:14:33,500
We brought you up with great care, son.

1828
02:14:34,375 --> 02:14:36,541
We always thought about you.

1829
02:14:37,333 --> 02:14:39,916
Is this what you give finally to us?

1830
02:14:41,916 --> 02:14:44,375
You are feeling bad that I’m doing offerings like this in front of us.

1831
02:14:45,708 --> 02:14:47,875
How much more would grandpa be feeling for what you did?

1832
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:03,500
Do the offerings now, Rishi. Do it for all of them.

1833
02:15:10,666 --> 02:15:11,583
Well done Murali.

1834
02:15:12,208 --> 02:15:16,750
Somaraju boasted to all in village about his children.

1835
02:15:17,458 --> 02:15:19,458
He should get the same today

1836
02:15:19,791 --> 02:15:20,541
and this is correct.

1837
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,916
Offerings should be done for all those in that photo.

1838
02:15:23,583 --> 02:15:26,458
With that, all of us in this village will
think Somaraju’s family doesn’t exist anymore.

1839
02:15:29,500 --> 02:15:31,083
Correct, you said it great grandpa

1840
02:15:31,208 --> 02:15:32,875
I understand though I’m not from your family.

1841
02:15:33,375 --> 02:15:37,875
After watching you all from close for so long,
I did this thinking how much pain did he get with what you did?

1842
02:15:38,375 --> 02:15:38,875
Yes!

1843
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:40,500
True!

1844
02:15:41,541 --> 02:15:46,583
As said by the priest, if brother’s soul was around here till the 11th day...

1845
02:15:47,166 --> 02:15:53,208
no idea how much bad is brother feeling
after seeing it all, happening here.

1846
02:15:53,708 --> 02:15:54,291
Murali...

1847
02:15:55,166 --> 02:15:56,541
you may not understand now.

1848
02:15:57,125 --> 02:16:00,208
But, this will haunt you lifelong after understanding.

1849
02:16:00,833 --> 02:16:02,791
Money is with us as long as we are alive.

1850
02:16:03,166 --> 02:16:04,958
None knows to whom it goes after we die.

1851
02:16:07,291 --> 02:16:07,750
Hey...

1852
02:16:08,666 --> 02:16:10,583
one should understand his parents.

1853
02:16:11,416 --> 02:16:15,541
And if you misunderstand them,
they have no reason even to give you the birth.

1854
02:16:16,958 --> 02:16:20,458
This offering is the last food we serve to the parents.

1855
02:16:22,708 --> 02:16:26,541
If they can’t eat that happily, they can’t cross river 'Vaitharani'.

1856
02:16:53,791 --> 02:16:54,541
Murali!

1857
02:17:00,666 --> 02:17:01,625
Daddy!

1858
02:17:04,083 --> 02:17:04,666
Daddy!

1859
02:17:17,750 --> 02:17:19,166
(Chants)

1860
02:18:14,333 --> 02:18:16,416
One final request to all of you.

1861
02:18:17,791 --> 02:18:24,458
