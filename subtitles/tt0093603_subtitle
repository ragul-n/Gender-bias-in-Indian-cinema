1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,131
Where is your father hiding? -
I don't know!

2
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:45,296
- Why hit a young child? - I
was asking where his father was.

3
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:49,632
So, must you hit a young boy?
Aren't you ashamed? Leave him!

4
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:55,896
He will tell us if we hit him a
few times. -Leave him. go out.

5
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:12,662
Don't fear me. You are not in
danger. Nor your father. go and tell him.

6
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:16,999
No one will do anything to
you.

7
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:57,432
- Did the cops hit you?
- It's alright. I didn't tell them anything.

8
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:06,000
Why are the police seeking
you out? Calling you a terrorist. Why?

9
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:13,201
They say they'll kill you at
sight. Is it wrong to be a union leader?

10
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:54,043
Along the streets of a southern
city, the one who came like a deer,

11
00:03:54,216 --> 00:04:02,014
Who had hit you?

12
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:19,342
Oh rising moon, do not fade.
Do not cry yourself away any more.

13
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:31,375
The heart cannot bear any
more tears.

14
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:39,882
Along the streets of a southern
city, the one who came like a deer,

15
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:50,042
Who had hit you?

16
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:03,914
Stealing scums!
- You're a Tamilian?

17
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:16,652
Why run away from home?
Did you fail your exams?

18
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:23,553
Then did you fight with
family? - I have no one at home.

19
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:31,385
Did you make trouble? Steal
money? Then?

20
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:36,621
I killed someone

21
00:05:53,358 --> 00:06:01,257
Along the streets of a southern
city, the one who came like a deer,

22
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:08,652
Who had hit you?

23
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:26,955
Oh rising moon, do not fade.
Do not cry yourself away any more.

24
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:38,619
The heart cannot bear any
more tears.

25
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:46,819
Along the streets of a southern
city, the one who came like a deer,

26
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:55,019
Who had hit you?

27
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:15,051
Can I ask you something? You
pray everyday and go to the mosque.

28
00:07:15,263 --> 00:07:21,958
You donate to anyone who
asks. But at night, you smuggle in goods.

29
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:24,528
Isn't it wrong?

30
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:34,662
No. Anything that can help
people is not wrong.

31
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:22,255
Can't you go elsewhere to
live? Evacuate! Evacuate!

32
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:29,468
If I hit you, you will die.

33
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,507
Did you get hit a lot?
- Did you get hurt?

34
00:12:42,617 --> 00:12:46,549
Why are you in this state? go!

35
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:12,344
He's sick but wants to go out
to sea. - You didn't tell him well!

36
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:15,782
He'll only listen to you.
- Where is he?

37
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:24,279
give that to me.
- I've given my word.

38
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:29,046
- Doesn't he have other men? -
Yes, tell him you're not well.

39
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:37,713
Not that. Munnusamy's
mother died and he has no money.

40
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:40,115
So, you want to go out to sea
and die is it?

41
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:47,417
I promised him money for the
funeral. I won't go back on my word.

42
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:54,478
Your word will stand. go and
sleep. - What are you saying?

43
00:13:54,689 --> 00:14:00,986
- I will get it. - I'm telling him
not to go and you want to start.

44
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:06,489
No, let this sin end with me.

45
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:12,317
No, this isn't a sin. Nothing is
wrong if it can help others.

46
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:22,417
Take Father and go.

47
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:44,681
- Don't worry, I'm here.
- Tie the tubes to the bags of salt.

48
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:55,788
- So many. Oh, its salt. - That
is what I said. - Are we trading salt?!

49
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:01,915
Listen and tie it. - This is what
happens with newcomers.

50
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:07,025
- I was checking for ropes.
- The ropes are here.

51
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:41,857
What are you doing? Who will
answer for the goods? Why throw them?

52
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:52,122
Do you know the price of
each? gone! We're dead when we get back!

53
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:55,423
go and row the boat!
- I don't know!

54
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:10,923
The customs officers are here!
We will go in for having the goods!

55
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:17,597
Only if the goods are on
board. - You threw them over didn't you?!

56
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:33,787
Don't overdo it! - But how will
we answer to Durai when asked for it?

57
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:40,360
You threw it with bags of salt!
How do we bring the goods up?

58
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:45,864
- What happens to the salt?
- It'll be wet! - And? - It will dissolve!

59
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:55,460
- Then the tubes will float up. -
So will the goods! You're a genius!

60
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:11,695
- The money; then the goods! -
Throw his 200 rupees at him!

61
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:17,801
Don't send 200! Send 2000!
- What? 2000?

62
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:23,201
Father only took 200; what
are you doing?

63
00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:29,232
Do you know what Durai will
do? - Pay up and take the goods!

64
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:35,892
- If I don't? - I'll throw the
goods! - Threatening me? - No!

65
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:48,297
- Do you know its value?
- No you tell me! - Stop it!

66
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:52,367
- Then the money? - I'll give
it! Take what you had asked for!

67
00:17:54,472 --> 00:18:01,428
Hussein's men? 2000? Tell me!
- Yes Sir.

68
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:10,569
Aren't you ashamed? get our
inspector! Hussein mustn't live!

69
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,603
How was it? Why this much of
money?

70
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:35,103
Wages. Your true wages for
the risks that you take.

71
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:41,002
I don't want so much. - It's for
those who come seeking your help.

72
00:18:41,508 --> 00:18:47,737
- My wages are 200. - Yes, I
took that for myself and Selva.

73
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:54,831
Come quickly. - Where?
- To a place of good fun!

74
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:24,705
My laughter is the festival of
lights. Every night here is sleepless.

75
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:43,167
I am a flower that blossom
with you. The nector of celestial beings.

76
00:19:43,378 --> 00:19:52,573
My laughter is the festival of
lights. Every night here is sleepless.

77
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,544
There isn't much to this world.
There is no day or night here.

78
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:43,843
There isn't much to this world.
There is no day or night here.

79
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:53,571
Everything that comes has to
go. Even the moon fades away.

80
00:20:54,649 --> 00:21:02,413
As my body is yearning away,
I see you here!

81
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,083
The time is right. Come!

82
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:16,107
My laughter is the festival of
lights. Every night here is sleepless.

83
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:26,812
l am a flower that blossoms
with you. The nector of celestial beings.

84
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:34,711
My laughter is the festival of
lights. Every night here is sleepless.

85
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:16,147
When did the waves go to
sleep? When did they cross the shores?

86
00:22:21,922 --> 00:22:29,321
When did the waves go to
sleep? When did they cross the shores?

87
00:22:30,922 --> 00:22:38,913
Instruments care not who
strum them - sweet music always abounds!

88
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:44,216
I too am an instrument in the
hand that strums!

89
00:22:44,756 --> 00:22:47,847
At the time when the
diamonds are shining in the sky!

90
00:22:48,257 --> 00:22:52,383
The time is right! Come!

91
00:22:52,958 --> 00:23:01,551
My laughter is the festival of
lights. Every night here is sleepless.

92
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:11,884
I am a flower that blossoms
with you. The nector of celestial beings.

93
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:19,924
My laughter is the festival of
lights. Every night here is sleepless.

94
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:40,752
Are you a Tamilian?
Can I ask you something?

95
00:23:43,827 --> 00:23:50,590
Could you let me go off early?
At about one is enough.

96
00:23:50,861 --> 00:23:54,726
Why do you need to go out
and earn somemore?

97
00:23:55,361 --> 00:24:07,921
No, I have a maths exam
tomorrow. If you let me go, I can practice.

98
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:30,420
Are you studying?
In a school?

99
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:42,562
- What school? - Nawaraji.
- Which grade? - 10th.

100
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:49,323
Its the midterms tomorrow.

101
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:02,729
If you go they'll send someone
else in.

102
00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:16,865
Just let me off at 1 . I will sit
here and study.

103
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,625
Books?

104
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:29,696
go on. Study.

105
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:32,007
The police came and took
father away last night. He has yet to return.

106
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:23,910
Why? What harm did he do to
anyone? Why did kill him? Tell me!

107
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:33,943
You promised to get me what I
want. I want him now! I want him!

108
00:28:45,847 --> 00:28:51,643
Are you happy now? He was
peacefully earning a little.

109
00:28:52,181 --> 00:29:00,239
You interfered! Look at him
now! You killed those reliant on him too!

110
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:04,914
Who brought him in?
- That Inspector!

111
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:13,970
Where is he now?
- No one knows. - Look after Shakila.

112
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,189
-Everyone says they didn't see
anything. - You speak Tamil. Ask them!

113
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:53,766
He was killed in broad
daylight! What do you mean by no one saw?

114
00:33:53,967 --> 00:34:00,264
I asked; shouted and
threatened. But no one is forthcoming.

115
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:10,662
All these people didn't see
anything? We must make them talk!

116
00:34:14,335 --> 00:34:22,132
Who killed the Inspector?
- I don't know! I didn't see.

117
00:34:26,502 --> 00:34:31,833
Until someone comes forth
with information, this boy will get hit!

118
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:45,460
I know! I saw it!

119
00:34:46,037 --> 00:34:50,299
Do you know who killed him?
- Yes. - Who?

120
00:34:52,538 --> 00:34:56,868
If you're scared to say it out
aloud, tell me in private.

121
00:34:57,005 --> 00:35:03,767
It's not fear but pride! Pride
that we have a man to kill this animal!

122
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:14,370
Pride that our women and
kids are safe! Pride of our new confidante!

123
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:23,939
Why should we hand him?For
your medals? We'd rather die!

124
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:32,695
Look we didn't see anything!
They're hitting children.

125
00:35:37,374 --> 00:35:41,431
You can hide the truth but
remember- the dead man is an officer.

126
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:43,468
We won't let the matter rest.

127
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:18,838
- I don't want. - We ate..
- I don't want anything. - Why this?

128
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:27,737
- It's enough you came.
- Leave it. It will be such from now. Come.

129
00:37:11,213 --> 00:37:16,908
He has been mentally retarded
since birth.

130
00:37:36,148 --> 00:37:39,273
Ask if she is the Inspector's
wife.

131
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:54,174
I am indebted to the officer. I
came to pay back the debt.

132
00:37:57,383 --> 00:38:02,873
I will try to pay his income
every month. Tell her.

133
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:07,507
- What are you saying?
- Money - I don't want it.

134
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:17,813
This is not for you. For your
son. I know the tramau of losing a dad.

135
00:38:23,118 --> 00:38:29,984
I don't want this boy to suffer.
Don't refuse.

136
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:34,279
I will somehow pay back my
debts.

137
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:12,146
-They want to build a factory.
- Houses? - Demolishing it.

138
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:17,085
-How? Is the land his?
- Yes. Apparently, he has bought it.

139
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,586
- Who? - That Seth.

140
00:39:21,122 --> 00:39:24,316
Anyone speaks Hindi around
here? - He knows.

141
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,447
Do you speak it well?
- Yes I know. - Come.

142
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:50,945
- He says it's work ..- Yes but
he is doing it at our house. Ask him.

143
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:08,613
- He's building a 10 lakh
- There are 10 thousand lives here.

144
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:13,119
Who has he asked for this?

145
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:36,818
- You're here in person.
- How are you?

146
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:44,682
We were lost. You came at the
right time. Sit down.

147
00:40:47,294 --> 00:40:51,556
- What is this? - Yes, Velu?
- They're building a factory here.

148
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:55,758
- Seth has bought the place.
- But so many of us live here.

149
00:40:55,928 --> 00:40:59,691
What can we do? It's
government land and he bought it.

150
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:05,691
- Can't you put in a word for
us? - I did. But he shows me the deed.

151
00:41:21,763 --> 00:41:27,458
- What do we do? - No choice.
Leave. We didn't pay rent or tax.

152
00:41:28,463 --> 00:41:37,726
How much did Seth pay you?
What was our price?

153
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:46,761
Tell us. What was our price?

154
00:41:54,998 --> 00:41:57,430
Come later. I am going with
Seth.

155
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,332
What is this? What is all this?

156
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:13,425
We have come to show Seth
what it means to lose one's home!

157
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:30,903
Listen to me! Leave him!
Leave him!

158
00:44:31,175 --> 00:44:34,972
Ask Seth to tear up the deed!

159
00:44:42,176 --> 00:44:46,165
Tear it! Tear it!

160
00:45:18,078 --> 00:45:25,739
Can you remember me? How
was the maths? You wrote it right?

161
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,807
If you don't like me,tell me. I
won't disturb you.

162
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,970
It's not that.

163
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:57,112
I'm scared that I might cry if I
talk to you.

164
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:04,146
Who else do I... see I told you I
would cry!

165
00:46:04,748 --> 00:46:09,180
Cry. Cry.

166
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:56,741
I am going to marry Neela.
Here. Now.

167
00:46:57,318 --> 00:47:01,149
What is all this suddenly?
Don't you at least need a nupital string?

168
00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:08,078
Tell the priest and arrange for
it. go.

169
00:48:46,592 --> 00:48:51,457
You are the music of love.

170
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:06,358
When orally expressed, it is
divine.

171
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:11,323
You are the music of love.

172
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:16,892
When orally expressed, it is
divine.

173
00:49:17,027 --> 00:49:21,221
You are the music of love.

174
00:49:52,029 --> 00:50:00,759
Two songbirds are going on a
tour somewhere.

175
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:11,296
The melody entitled love can
be heard being sung.

176
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:14,326
A shower of music ..

177
00:50:17,131 --> 00:50:26,793
A shower of music falls upon
us. Our souls are soaking in it.

178
00:50:27,031 --> 00:50:36,330
All the waves are the melodies
being created by divinity.

179
00:50:37,066 --> 00:50:41,624
We shall appreciate it day and
night.

180
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:46,696
You are the music of love.

181
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,959
When orally expressed, it is
divine.

182
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:02,227
You are the music of love.

183
00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:36,935
Why hang my soul loosely on
the hair that you place flowers on?

184
00:51:37,603 --> 00:51:46,628
How do you create fire even
on the moon that creates serenity?

185
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:50,534
O' sea breeze ..

186
00:51:52,637 --> 00:52:01,367
O' sea breeze, make way. An
angel is here with me.

187
00:52:03,138 --> 00:52:12,128
O' wind do not hide the
footprints we left as a pair on the sand!

188
00:52:12,972 --> 00:52:17,496
Let the journey carry on each
day!

189
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:22,071
You are the music of love.

190
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:31,605
When orally expressed, it is
divine.

191
00:52:32,173 --> 00:52:37,538
You are the music of love.

192
00:52:44,674 --> 00:52:48,367
- What do you want?
- I need to see Velu Naicker.

193
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:51,007
- Father is showering.
- What do you want?

194
00:52:51,175 --> 00:52:56,699
-Are you his son? Your name?
- Surya. - Mine's Charumathi.

195
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:02,832
- When he first came, he
looked like you. - What do you want?

196
00:53:02,976 --> 00:53:10,307
My son is in jail. I need to save
him. - I will send father.

197
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:20,200
Come quickly! A lot of people
are waiting for you! Come quickly!

198
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:25,365

Okay!

199
00:53:28,577 --> 00:53:32,134
- Who is kissing my wife?
- Your daughter!

200
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:38,169
That's why!
- One minute!

201
00:53:45,678 --> 00:53:48,508
Now you can go.
- Okay.

202
00:53:55,778 --> 00:54:01,143
You wait. You come. Come. -
greetings Sir.

203
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:08,701
- What is it? - My son was
arrested. You must somehow ..

204
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,508
-What did he do?- Nothing. -
Is that why they arrested him?

205
00:54:15,614 --> 00:54:22,138
What did he do? Tell me so!

206
00:54:24,081 --> 00:54:29,173
- Which station? - Chemboor.
- Who's the Inspector there?

207
00:54:29,481 --> 00:54:37,847
- Mathur. - I'll take care of it. -
Sir,.. - I said I'll take care of it.

208
00:54:38,815 --> 00:54:45,738
I take my leave. go.

209
00:54:56,149 --> 00:55:00,275
- Why are you crying?
- My father chased me out of the house.

210
00:55:00,416 --> 00:55:03,348
- What did you do? - Steal.
- Tell me so!

211
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:10,942
Don't steal again. Iyer!
- That's me! - give her some money!

212
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:17,442
- What's the injury?
- I fell down.

213
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:20,243
Are you going to school well?

214
00:55:23,851 --> 00:55:26,783
- Why are you crying?
- The maths teacher hit me.

215
00:55:26,918 --> 00:55:29,578
What did you do?
- I did my sums wrongly.

216
00:55:29,718 --> 00:55:33,014
- What is the teacher's name?
- 2 plaits Kanaga.

217
00:55:33,185 --> 00:55:41,516
Tell Selva to hit the teacher.
Are you well? Come later.

218
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,814
What do you want?

219
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,949
Wait! Wait!
- I was just joking!

220
00:56:24,755 --> 00:56:29,120
The one with the hat is Lalh
Bai. The fair one over there.

221
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:36,288
You can't tell at sight but he is
a terrible man.

222
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:48,753
Come! Come! Are you well?

223
00:57:01,157 --> 00:57:05,886
The 3 big shots are here.
Include Lalh and it's 4.

224
00:57:06,024 --> 00:57:10,548
Their wealth comes to 100
crores but do they look like it?

225
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:18,849
There's no nation or good they
haven't seen! Wanted by all places!

226
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:22,751
Now, we're number 5.

227
00:57:45,494 --> 00:57:47,460
What is 400 in Hindi?

228
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:31,290
Telugu ... - You can't speak it?
It's alright.

229
00:58:39,697 --> 00:58:43,629
Looks like big trouble.
They're clashing. Do you understand it?

230
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:48,497
Reddy wants out at the
harbour for 6 months due to the cops.

231
00:58:48,632 --> 00:58:50,495
The other says that is not
possible. Isn't that it?

232
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:56,287
Not only that. 30 lakhs of
goods are in the boat. Reddy can't get it.

233
00:59:02,932 --> 00:59:08,297
Reddy says it is not possible. I
would like to try once.

234
00:59:08,432 --> 00:59:11,887
You want to do something
which we can't do?

235
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:22,926
- I will bring their goods out. -
If you get caught, that's it!

236
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,094
But if I bring it out?

237
00:59:39,768 --> 00:59:43,996
Tell him that if I can do what
he can't, then the harbour is mine!

238
00:59:44,135 --> 00:59:45,828
Tell them!

239
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:26,730
You killed them off!

240
01:00:40,939 --> 01:00:44,598
We're out at sea after so long.
But empty handed!

241
01:00:44,739 --> 01:00:48,637
We should have brought
drinks! - You could have if you wanted to!

242
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:54,706
I came alone. - If you're that
desparate,bring a girl!

243
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,602
- What? - If you're that
desparate, why not bring a girl too?

244
01:01:35,908 --> 01:01:40,898
The moon is high on the sky!
The girl is on the boat!

245
01:01:46,876 --> 01:01:53,503
It is dancing and seeking you
out! What is it?

246
01:01:53,644 --> 01:01:58,906
When the sun sets, a
companion is needed.

247
01:01:59,176 --> 01:02:04,303
The young one's dance will
end only with dawn!

248
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:09,410
The moon is high on the sky!
The girl is on the boat!

249
01:02:09,544 --> 01:02:16,443
It is dancing and seeking you
out! What is it?

250
01:02:53,913 --> 01:02:56,744
Of the running wolves, one is
an old wolf.

251
01:02:58,614 --> 01:03:01,603
Of the dancing wolves, one is a
sly wolf.

252
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:06,606
Of the running wolves, on is
an old wolf!

253
01:03:08,848 --> 01:03:11,747
Of the dancing wolves, one is a
sly wolf!

254
01:03:14,448 --> 01:03:18,881
In a world that goes to war
over woman and gold,

255
01:03:19,116 --> 01:03:24,014
Hunger comes everyday! Does
eating satisfy it?

256
01:03:24,449 --> 01:03:28,882
Dear, I am a worker! Your
friend!

257
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:35,038
The moon is high on the sky!
The girl is on the boat!

258
01:03:35,284 --> 01:03:42,080
It is dancing and seeking you
out! What is it?

259
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,312
I have seen exciting dances on
screen!

260
01:04:21,387 --> 01:04:24,114
I've been part of the dancing
crowds on the floor!

261
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:29,278
I have seen exciting dances on
screen!

262
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,484
I've been part of the dancing
crowds on the floor!

263
01:04:36,187 --> 01:04:41,586
I've worked hard in the field
and forest! Shouldn't I sing and dance?

264
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:46,719
I have seen poverty and pain.
Shouldn't your outfits suffer poverty?

265
01:04:46,855 --> 01:04:52,015
Dear, I am a worker! Your
friend!

266
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:58,213
The moon is high on the sky!
The girl is on the boat!

267
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:09,852
It is dancing and seeking you
out! What is it?

268
01:05:10,223 --> 01:05:15,383
When the sun sets, a
companion is needed.

269
01:05:16,056 --> 01:05:20,887
The young one's dance will
end only with dawn!

270
01:05:21,024 --> 01:05:26,013
The moon is high on the sky!
The girl is on the boat!

271
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:32,987
It is dancing and seeking you
out! What is it?

272
01:06:09,726 --> 01:06:13,386
I have brought Kohli's and
Bhai's goods.

273
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:33,956
I don't want money. This is
my present to the Reddiars.

274
01:06:40,462 --> 01:06:47,861
- We mustn't let him off.
- He got away though we told customs.

275
01:06:47,995 --> 01:06:54,622
We should have whacked him
up! It's all too late now!

276
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:59,262
This will hurt our family
honour!

277
01:06:59,397 --> 01:07:01,590
This hurts not just our honour
but our family itself!

278
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:15,594
Kill. Velu, his wife and 2 kids.
None of them should be alive.

279
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:37,830
Looks like my child might die!
Save my child! Save my child!

280
01:07:47,533 --> 01:07:51,022
Baby has a high fever. You
must help.

281
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:52,790
Come tomorrow morning.

282
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:01,357
- The child might die!
- No admission.

283
01:08:01,501 --> 01:08:05,331
The child is dying. Tell him!

284
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:13,864
Ask him what his name is.

285
01:08:17,602 --> 01:08:19,568
Ask him what his address is.

286
01:08:24,735 --> 01:08:27,667
Ask him if he has kids and
family.

287
01:08:30,769 --> 01:08:35,828
For his kid to be well, our kid
too has to be well. Tell him.

288
01:08:40,936 --> 01:08:45,868
go. go and treat the child.

289
01:08:56,837 --> 01:09:01,395
What were you doing? Why
didn't you call the ambulance?

290
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:05,993
We did. But they said no.
- Why? - Because it is the slum side..

291
01:09:06,138 --> 01:09:11,696
- So they won't come to the
slum? - No. It has never come before.

292
01:09:15,139 --> 01:09:16,968
- How old is the child?
- 1 1/2 years old.

293
01:09:17,472 --> 01:09:24,496
Will the doctor give life if the
child dies? That's the worth of the poor!

294
01:09:26,472 --> 01:09:29,700
Ask him what the cost of an
ambulance is. - 40 to 50 thousand.

295
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,395
We will buy 5! Leave it for us!
It will work only for the poor!

296
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:41,904
- 5 will be.. - Let it be! We will
buy it! Do you understand?

297
01:09:42,507 --> 01:09:44,440
Sit down. - No, you ..

298
01:09:56,108 --> 01:10:03,007
-Ask her how the child is.
- Don't worry.

299
01:10:06,876 --> 01:10:10,467
The worst is over. But the
child must stay for 2 days..

300
01:10:11,209 --> 01:10:15,698
We can cover the costs! Your
child is fine! The doctor!

301
01:10:19,942 --> 01:10:28,343
Thank him! You saved a life!
We can't! Don't mistake me!

302
01:11:40,548 --> 01:11:45,742
The cloudy skies shower
golden rain on this festive day!

303
01:11:45,948 --> 01:11:50,643
A great day that proclaims
that our time has come!

304
01:11:50,782 --> 01:11:56,409
The sounds of drums! And of
joy! Chariots run along our streets!

305
01:11:56,616 --> 01:12:01,916
Chariots run on this festive
day! All day shall the festivities last!

306
01:12:06,377 --> 01:12:11,100
The cloudy skies shower
golden rain on this festive day!

307
01:12:11,238 --> 01:12:17,255
A great day that proclaims
that our time has come!

308
01:12:50,357 --> 01:12:55,215
The path that you tread has
become fertile land!

309
01:12:55,418 --> 01:12:59,902
The path we tread now has no
poverty within sight!

310
01:13:01,178 --> 01:13:06,036
Who built the schools and
places of art? We did!

311
01:13:06,172 --> 01:13:11,530
Who created a regime that can
rule the nation? We did!

312
01:13:11,732 --> 01:13:17,022
We are the roots of a
plantation named nation!

313
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:22,641
We are the flame of the light
named sacrifice!

314
01:13:22,818 --> 01:13:27,710
We will sing our melody!

315
01:13:27,879 --> 01:13:33,305
The cloudy skies shower
golden rain on this festive day!

316
01:13:33,471 --> 01:13:38,421
A great day that proclaims
that our time has come!

317
01:13:38,565 --> 01:13:43,991
The sounds of drums! And of
joy! Chariots run along our streets!

318
01:13:44,126 --> 01:13:49,779
Chariots run on this festive
day! All day shall the festivities last!

319
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:33,094
Hundreds of pots of honey and
milk came!

320
01:14:33,299 --> 01:14:38,487
A god that we pray to has
come in person!

321
01:14:38,726 --> 01:14:43,618
garland him now! Light the
camphor!

322
01:14:43,753 --> 01:14:48,975
All the joys in the village! You
will show the way now!

323
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:54,937
Auspiciousness has now filled
the house!

324
01:14:55,073 --> 01:15:00,366
Watching this has brought joy
to the heart!

325
01:15:00,366 --> 01:15:05,452
We will sing our melody!

326
01:15:05,594 --> 01:15:11,111
The cloudy skies shower
golden rain on this festive day!

327
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:16,179
A great day that proclaims
that our time has come!

328
01:15:16,914 --> 01:15:21,341
The sounds of drums! And of
joy! Chariots run along our streets!

329
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:27,457
Chariots run on this festive
day! All day shall the festivities last!

330
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,458
The cloudy skies shower
golden rain on this festive day!

331
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:38,177
A great day that proclaims
that our time has come!

332
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:51,965
Have they both slept here?
Look at Surya. He sleeps like you too.

333
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:59,128
He's always talking about how
he wants to be like you when he's older.

334
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:06,744
- We're making a mistake.
- Why?

335
01:16:06,886 --> 01:16:14,867
Let my job end with me. Why
them? They shouldn't want this!

336
01:16:15,043 --> 01:16:18,903
They must study well!

337
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:27,654
Send them to Madras. Let
them stay with Shakila and study there.

338
01:16:29,092 --> 01:16:31,748
That's when my influence
won't be there.

339
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,540
Scared that your child will be
away from you?

340
01:16:38,248 --> 01:16:43,140
How would you survive away
from them? You love them so much.

341
01:16:57,058 --> 01:17:01,383
I am not important. They are.

342
01:17:04,251 --> 01:17:10,437
Shall I tell you something? If I
die now, I will die happily!

343
01:17:11,242 --> 01:17:12,933
I promise. I will die very
happily..

344
01:17:17,235 --> 01:17:25,590
Save this poor woman. My life
is in danger! Help! Come!

345
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:31,479
Who is it?
- Ask him to come!

346
01:17:31,717 --> 01:17:41,468
- Enough. - Who is it?
- Tell him not to come. He's in danger!

347
01:17:41,605 --> 01:17:45,692
Come in! Neela! Come in!

348
01:18:53,851 --> 01:18:58,608
Everyone's waiting. If you
come ..

349
01:19:01,209 --> 01:19:07,963
When Neela's ashes are
dissolved, no male Reddy should be alive.

350
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:57,006
Who are you? Who? Who are
you?

351
01:21:44,511 --> 01:21:46,532
Surya, look after her.

352
01:21:51,004 --> 01:21:53,024
Keep the ticket carefully.

353
01:21:56,297 --> 01:22:03,449
Everyone says mother died
because of you. Is it true?

354
01:22:06,185 --> 01:22:12,576
Tell me! Tell me! Is it true?

355
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:42,897
Along the streets of the
southern city, the one who came like a deer,

356
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:49,590
Who had hit you?

357
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:08,042
Oh rising moon do not fade!
Do not cry yourself away any more!

358
01:23:09,009 --> 01:23:20,555
The heart cannot bear any
more tears!

359
01:23:20,695 --> 01:23:28,551
Along the streets of the
southern city, the one who came like a deer,

360
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:37,563
Who had hit you?

361
01:24:15,995 --> 01:24:19,355
- Sir, my first child. You must
name him.

362
01:24:21,155 --> 01:24:27,704
girl? - Son.
- Name him ganesh!

363
01:24:58,976 --> 01:25:01,962
Don't fight. I'll give you more
later.

364
01:25:02,105 --> 01:25:06,997
I did the prayer in
Charumathi's name. Send her the offerings.

365
01:25:07,133 --> 01:25:13,547
She's no longer a child. She's a
brat. He's always in trouble now.

366
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:28,040
- Enough. Stop. Hey why are
you just watching? - You're getting old.

367
01:25:35,132 --> 01:25:40,058
- Enough stop. The sea is here.
See. - Why are you scared father?

368
01:25:46,119 --> 01:25:52,374
- Don't be scared. - Don't stop!
- Hold the wheels! Hold it!

369
01:26:00,635 --> 01:26:06,061
- Father are you alright? Are
you injured? - Are you hurt?

370
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:11,387
Thank god my body was
strong enough for this.

371
01:26:11,589 --> 01:26:20,069
- Why so much for this small
thing? - Run! He can't catch you!

372
01:26:32,263 --> 01:26:34,022
- Is Naicker in?
-Wait he'll be here soon.

373
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:38,554
I knew him well once but lost
touch. I need to see him urgently now.

374
01:26:38,689 --> 01:26:42,048
- What is the matter? - Isn't he
in? I'll just need 5 minutes with him.

375
01:26:42,251 --> 01:26:49,403
He's in the prayer. Tell me.
- go on. He's Naicker's son.

376
01:26:50,574 --> 01:26:57,761
My only son has finally got a
job after 4 years in Dubai.

377
01:26:58,132 --> 01:27:03,558
Everything is ready for him to
go overseas tomorrow. - Calm down.

378
01:27:03,792 --> 01:27:10,512
He hit a child while he was
driving my car to the passport office.

379
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:15,668
- What happened to the child?
- It died on the spot.

380
01:27:16,443 --> 01:27:20,393
Fearing the people, he left the
car there and ran off.

381
01:27:20,571 --> 01:27:26,656
But it wasn't his fault. The
child was playing and didn't see the car.

382
01:27:26,897 --> 01:27:34,287
His future is ruined.
- What car was it? - Ambassador. - Whose?

383
01:27:34,454 --> 01:27:45,829
- Mine. - go to the police &
complain that you lost your car. Predate it.

384
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:53,126
- Leave that to me. - Okay. Do
you have a driving licence? - Yes.

385
01:27:53,265 --> 01:27:59,349
-Where was this?-Matunga
- go to the station there and say you did it.

386
01:28:00,923 --> 01:28:05,441
get money from Iyer. I will
take care of your house. You will be out soon.

387
01:28:05,618 --> 01:28:10,476
go on without worrying. Your
son will go overseas.

388
01:28:10,611 --> 01:28:16,060
I'm Velu Naicker's son. I will
do as promised.

389
01:28:21,864 --> 01:28:31,513
Look at this boy! Just a kid!
You solved it the way father would!

390
01:28:36,912 --> 01:28:42,963
Did you hear? They seem
better than us. You didn't see it!

391
01:28:43,238 --> 01:28:52,025
I saw it. Surya, don't. Don't
come into this.

392
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:30,439
You want to become an
inspector?

393
01:29:30,581 --> 01:29:36,030
He wants to be one like his
father. He went for the police selections.

394
01:29:39,903 --> 01:29:43,729
They refused to take him in
because he was mentally retarted.

395
01:29:50,524 --> 01:29:52,952
No.

396
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,987
Okay go on.

397
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:23,773
From now on, you're my
personal Inspector.

398
01:30:31,374 --> 01:30:34,360
Ask him to come from
tomorrow. Just come and go.

399
01:30:48,952 --> 01:30:52,607
- SP is coming. - Who? Which
SP?

400
01:30:52,848 --> 01:30:58,740
- Raghavan. -Why is he here?
- I don't know! He's here!

401
01:30:59,407 --> 01:31:04,924
- He's here. Leave it. Anything
else? - No. We came for this only.

402
01:31:09,894 --> 01:31:17,579
- I'm Raghavan. - SP. Yes, I
know you. From twenty years ago.

403
01:31:17,718 --> 01:31:20,146
Come. That's okay. Come.

404
01:31:23,112 --> 01:31:26,404
I have no search warrant or
arrest warrant.

405
01:31:26,574 --> 01:31:33,056
You don't need one. Search
out whatever you need.

406
01:31:33,233 --> 01:31:38,988
I am not here as a police
officer. I'm here for your help.

407
01:31:42,755 --> 01:31:50,473
Sit down. Sit up there. I prefer
this.

408
01:31:54,041 --> 01:31:59,830
I need to talk to you in private.

409
01:32:00,566 --> 01:32:02,995
go.

410
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:09,487
go on.

411
01:32:09,622 --> 01:32:17,704
My child's wedding's next
week. But it won't go on. She's hospitalised.

412
01:32:20,875 --> 01:32:28,231
- She's unconcious. - What
happened?

413
01:32:28,532 --> 01:32:38,182
I had always taught her to be
fearless being a policeman's daughter.

414
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:46,170
Last night, she went out to buy
clothes. She came back like a torn outfit.

415
01:32:46,511 --> 01:32:54,525


416
01:32:56,033 --> 01:33:02,423
Why are you here? You
should get them in and break their bones!

417
01:33:02,591 --> 01:33:07,449
I found out who they are. But
I couldn't break their bones. - Why?

418
01:33:07,685 --> 01:33:17,039
It was the minister's son. If it
was anyone else, he'll be in pieces now.

419
01:33:18,539 --> 01:33:25,554
I told the IG. He asked for
evidence. None. He asked if I was rich. No.

420
01:33:25,697 --> 01:33:32,111
He said leave it as they were
rich and could manipulate everything.

421
01:33:32,488 --> 01:33:39,878
But I can't leave it! Everytime
I see her, I can't leave it!

422
01:33:41,877 --> 01:33:47,303
So I decided to leave
everything and run to you here!

423
01:33:51,865 --> 01:33:58,222
- I understand your grief. -
Not just that .. - I too have a daughter.

424
01:33:59,522 --> 01:34:08,638
I'll take care of it. You
shouldn't be here long. I'll take care of it.

425
01:34:58,018 --> 01:35:07,304
I'm coming from the hospital.
He's alive but merely a vegetable.

426
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:14,388
- Are you happy? - She saw
me. - Not just you but your animal sides!

427
01:35:14,531 --> 01:35:19,787
- An innocent boy.. - No, he
made a mistake and earned this.

428
01:35:19,925 --> 01:35:26,147
- Who are you to decide?
- You don't get it. The officer...

429
01:35:31,944 --> 01:35:37,767
Just tell me one thing. Who do
you think you are? god?

430
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:46,787
Then who are you to decide
what is justiciable and punish?

431
01:35:46,926 --> 01:35:49,945
Why did you do that today?

432
01:35:52,153 --> 01:35:56,047
I had promised.
- To whom?

433
01:36:07,035 --> 01:36:14,891
Another father like me.
- So you can promise to heartlessly kill.

434
01:36:15,026 --> 01:36:20,179
He had made a grave mistake.
- Let it be.

435
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:27,505
Who are you to punish? We
have a legal system for this. Why you?

436
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:33,902
You're educated and have
lived well. But we're not like that.

437
01:36:34,502 --> 01:36:42,754
We suffered for food. And
before we could bring back money, we died.

438
01:36:44,823 --> 01:36:49,545
Were we ever sure that we
would live till night?

439
01:36:51,481 --> 01:36:56,498
So we don't think of the courts
and cops.

440
01:36:56,642 --> 01:37:02,261
You need to hit back to
survive. We need to take up arms to live.

441
01:37:02,501 --> 01:37:09,687
Would that make everything
you do right?

442
01:37:09,826 --> 01:37:13,810
I only do what I feel is right.

443
01:37:13,954 --> 01:37:20,742
Then can I act as I wish to? I
feel that Selva was wrong to hit that boy.

444
01:37:20,879 --> 01:37:24,239
I feel that it is right to hit him
back!

445
01:37:27,970 --> 01:37:35,792
Leave her! It's our girl!
- I'll kill you!

446
01:37:37,825 --> 01:37:42,910
- Where did you learn to hit
others? - From us! Leave it.

447
01:37:58,699 --> 01:38:08,246
- Why did you hit me? Why?
Tell me. - No, you hit Selva..

448
01:38:08,455 --> 01:38:14,744
You felt it was wrong though I
felt it was right!

449
01:38:16,811 --> 01:38:21,602
What you feel is right is felt to
be atrocious by the rest of the place!

450
01:38:21,739 --> 01:38:27,686
- I was wrong to hit you. - No,
not hitting me. Hitting the rest is wrong.

451
01:38:29,962 --> 01:38:38,749
- What do you want me to do?
- Leave it. Leave everything.

452
01:38:38,885 --> 01:38:43,278
- I will die. If I leave it.
- Then are you going to remain like this?

453
01:38:43,446 --> 01:38:46,374
- Won't you ever stop?

454
01:38:50,004 --> 01:38:53,398
I will stop. But ask them to
stop. - Whom?

455
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,430
Everyone!
- Who?

456
01:38:55,531 --> 01:39:01,082
The one who killed a union
leader who asked for his rights.

457
01:39:01,224 --> 01:39:04,618
Ask him to stop and I will!

458
01:39:04,753 --> 01:39:09,612
The one who killed an
innocent old man and labelled it as sucide!

459
01:39:09,747 --> 01:39:12,267
Ask him to stop and I will!

460
01:39:12,443 --> 01:39:17,495
The one who drove a
bulldozer through a slum community!

461
01:39:17,638 --> 01:39:21,133
Ask him to stop and I will!

462
01:39:21,133 --> 01:39:23,392
The one who killed your
mother at midnight!

463
01:39:25,529 --> 01:39:31,386
Ask him to stop and I will.

464
01:39:33,052 --> 01:39:39,069
Do we do this out of choice?
There is no other way.

465
01:39:39,211 --> 01:39:44,331
From the bottom of your
heart, isn't what you're doing wrong?

466
01:39:46,503 --> 01:39:52,951
No. Anything that can help
others is not wrong.

467
01:39:53,129 --> 01:39:58,884
Is it fair to kill one to help
others? - You don't understand.

468
01:39:59,087 --> 01:40:04,944
I don't! I don't wish to know!
Leave me! Leave me!

469
01:40:06,278 --> 01:40:13,862
- Ask him to go away! go
away! Please! - I'll take care. It'll be fine.

470
01:40:32,247 --> 01:40:38,104
- Come. - I wish to see
Naicker. - Father is not well.

471
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:43,757
- I need to see him. -Sit down.
Sit down.

472
01:40:49,427 --> 01:40:57,181
The SP is here. He wants to
see you urgently. Shall I bring him in?

473
01:41:09,769 --> 01:41:11,857
- Aren't you well?

474
01:41:21,188 --> 01:41:25,638
- Do you know anyone named
Pandian? - That Salem Pandian..

475
01:41:28,746 --> 01:41:34,797
- He was working for me for
some time. - He was arrested.

476
01:41:37,935 --> 01:41:45,757
He will be in court tomorrow
to testify against you.

477
01:41:50,919 --> 01:41:54,971
To think you were trying to
help me and you got into this.

478
01:41:56,745 --> 01:42:05,293
I, as a policeman, cannot stop
this. I don't know how you'll stop this.

479
01:42:07,299 --> 01:42:13,781
I thought I should tell you this.
I'll take my leave.

480
01:42:15,057 --> 01:42:18,848
My daughter is fine now.

481
01:42:32,202 --> 01:42:40,988
Call Selva. - He's not here.
You asked him to leave town for some time.

482
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:54,673
I'll take care of this.
Don't you trust me?

483
01:42:57,206 --> 01:43:02,790
- How this should be done..
- I know. He mustn't come. Or talk.

484
01:43:02,865 --> 01:43:09,756
None of our people will be
involved. Outsiders only.

485
01:43:10,422 --> 01:43:19,311
We must have no association
with this. I'll take care of it.

486
01:45:43,705 --> 01:45:50,686
-Surya here. Pandian has..
- Not on the phone. Tell me in person.

487
01:45:50,862 --> 01:45:56,754
I called you so that you don't
worry.

488
01:45:56,888 --> 01:46:03,177
- Who asked you to come?
- He didn't say a word in court.

489
01:46:03,347 --> 01:46:14,722
-I'll hang up. Did you call me?
- You come.

490
01:46:17,863 --> 01:46:22,381
- I told you to send someone
for the money. - Don't worry.

491
01:46:22,657 --> 01:46:28,605
They couldn't get me there. As
if they could get me here.

492
01:46:32,711 --> 01:46:37,660
Didn't you change the vehicle?

493
01:47:38,665 --> 01:47:45,613
What is it? At this time? Hello
Inspector. No stones today?

494
01:47:54,679 --> 01:48:02,194
What is the matter? How
come everyone is here so early now?

495
01:48:02,336 --> 01:48:09,250
SP how come you are here so
early?

496
01:48:18,683 --> 01:48:22,804
Did something happen to
someone?

497
01:48:32,033 --> 01:48:38,424
I don't understand. Has
something happened? Why so quiet?!

498
01:48:43,553 --> 01:48:46,209
I don't understand. What has
happened here?

499
01:48:54,173 --> 01:49:02,563
Where is Surya? What
happened to him?

500
01:50:13,178 --> 01:50:18,298
He got burnt badly. Don't see
it.

501
01:51:41,338 --> 01:51:49,284
Along the streets of the
southern city, the one who came like a deer,

502
01:51:49,462 --> 01:51:56,750
Who had hit you?

503
01:52:04,044 --> 01:52:14,397
Oh rising moon, do not fade.
Do not cry yourself away anymore.

504
01:52:14,598 --> 01:52:26,450
The heart cannot bear any
more tears.

505
01:52:26,584 --> 01:52:34,837
Along the streets of the
southern city, the one who came like a deer,

506
01:52:34,973 --> 01:52:43,794
Who had hit you?

507
01:53:18,953 --> 01:53:25,810
I'm going. I'm leaving you and
going.

508
01:53:25,979 --> 01:53:28,272
I can't stay here any longer.

509
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:38,530
First you killed mother. Now
brother. If I stay here, I will die.

510
01:53:43,457 --> 01:53:50,813
I have no desire to be your
child. I will think of myself as an orphan.

511
01:53:52,513 --> 01:53:58,665
I'm going back to Madras.
Don't stop me. Or search for me.

512
01:53:58,839 --> 01:54:01,529
I don't need to know whether
you're alive or dead.

513
01:54:01,669 --> 01:54:08,991
Leave me. You have no wife.
Or son. Now, forget the daughter too!

514
01:54:09,492 --> 01:54:14,975
Just think you disowned me!
Leave me!

515
01:55:20,673 --> 01:55:23,931
The prayer is in Charumathi's
name. Take the offerings.

516
01:55:26,499 --> 01:55:35,013
- Shall I search for her?
- No. Leave her. I promised not to hinder.

517
01:55:35,155 --> 01:55:40,978
- She might be suffering.
- She won't. She's my child. She'll survive.

518
01:56:15,107 --> 01:56:21,225
See who it is. If it is a new
officer, tell them to let us end this first.

519
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:27,584
Tell them I said so.
- I'll take care.

520
01:56:36,881 --> 01:56:42,102
- They say we don't have
permission for this. - Who must we ask?

521
01:56:42,275 --> 01:56:47,894
We didn't get police
permission. - Have we ever asked for that?

522
01:56:48,467 --> 01:56:52,326
I asked. He said the mistakes
of the last 30 years must end.

523
01:56:52,462 --> 01:56:55,050
- Who said so?
- The new Assistant Commissioner.

524
01:57:24,324 --> 01:57:27,683
These vehicles help the poor.
How can we seize them?

525
01:57:27,819 --> 01:57:30,781
I know what else these are
used for!

526
01:57:30,915 --> 01:57:36,569
This involves Velu Naicker. It
might bring about a problem.

527
01:57:36,708 --> 01:57:40,602
Who pays your salary? The
department or them? Do it!

528
01:58:05,374 --> 01:58:09,301
Who do you think we are?
Naicker will take your neck!

529
01:58:09,436 --> 01:58:12,365
Yes! We know you do that!

530
01:58:24,850 --> 01:58:30,503
Who? Who laid his hands on
Selva?!

531
01:58:34,472 --> 01:58:37,298
They hit him in public and
arrested him!

532
01:58:37,435 --> 01:58:41,692
Aren't you ashamed to come
tell me this? What were you doing?!

533
01:58:43,861 --> 01:58:48,288
Has anyone ever touched him?
Would I ever let them do that?!

534
01:58:48,588 --> 01:58:53,039
- What does he want? Why
this arrest? - We don't know.

535
01:58:56,445 --> 01:59:03,733
Why didn't you ask? - He hits
all of our men everywhere!

536
01:59:03,903 --> 01:59:10,089
- You're old. Why didn't you
ask? - He might throw me in too.

537
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:21,082
Fear of the uniform! Look!
These are their scars! Feel these!

538
01:59:23,246 --> 01:59:29,761
- Where is that policeman's
house? - Don't. Why must you go there?

539
01:59:29,905 --> 01:59:36,988
Who's inside? Selva! Who
knows his house? Who?!

540
01:59:38,262 --> 01:59:45,345
- Don't you know or are you
scared? - I know.

541
02:01:24,832 --> 02:01:32,483
I didn't see any other way to
dissolve the sin that I was born with.

542
02:01:36,219 --> 02:01:42,701
I married an officer so that at
least my child won't have the sins.

543
02:01:48,937 --> 02:01:58,916
- Does he know who you..
- No. He believes I am an orphan. So do I.

544
02:02:11,576 --> 02:02:22,020
- Your child? Is it a son?
- Leave him. Don't let him know you exist?

545
02:02:25,392 --> 02:02:30,318
go. Please.

546
02:04:37,633 --> 02:04:42,185
- He's not here. - Where is he?
- I don't know.

547
02:04:54,645 --> 02:05:00,468
I don't know!

548
02:05:18,650 --> 02:05:22,702
Where is he? - Not here.
- Where? - I don't know!

549
02:05:39,424 --> 02:05:42,148
Tell me. Where is he hiding?

550
02:05:42,288 --> 02:05:44,581
I don't know.

551
02:06:25,968 --> 02:06:35,118
The police are coming! Leave!
Leave! The police are coming!

552
02:07:27,827 --> 02:07:31,084
You still can't arrest him?

553
02:07:36,350 --> 02:07:46,998
Everyone is on his side. Today,
a lady burnt herself to save him.

554
02:07:47,137 --> 02:07:56,116
In front of me. I don't
understand why they respect him so much.

555
02:08:02,784 --> 02:08:09,175
Maybe someone else is
informing them ahead of time of your moves.

556
02:08:09,343 --> 02:08:13,997
- I don't understand. - Velu
Naicker has 2 children. Do you know?

557
02:08:14,137 --> 02:08:16,532
They died in some petrol bunk
accident.

558
02:08:16,801 --> 02:08:21,490
The son died. But the
daughter lived. He sent them to Madras.

559
02:08:21,795 --> 02:08:28,777
Most people don't know that
he has a daughter. - The relevance?

560
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:53,818
Why did you come here? We'll
take care. Please leave.

561
02:09:12,334 --> 02:09:23,345
- What is this? - I didn't say a
word. I don't know how I was brave.

562
02:09:23,487 --> 02:09:29,504
Put him to bed. -Are you well?
- I am fine.

563
02:09:29,646 --> 02:09:34,471
I can die. It's an honour to die
for you.

564
02:09:59,311 --> 02:10:05,600
- Look here. - She's lost
conciousness. She doesn't talk at all.

565
02:10:05,736 --> 02:10:13,182
She won't live past the night.
The doctor said that she won't live.

566
02:10:20,152 --> 02:10:25,237
How can you be like this?

567
02:10:34,668 --> 02:10:40,718
Enough!

568
02:10:45,355 --> 02:10:47,477
Where is the phone?
- It's here.

569
02:10:51,314 --> 02:10:55,401
- Call the AC. - What are you
going to do?

570
02:10:55,575 --> 02:10:59,095
I am going to call him.- It will
make their sacrifices meaningless!

571
02:10:59,271 --> 02:11:01,700
All that I've done will be
meaningless.

572
02:11:01,869 --> 02:11:07,124
I always felt it fine to do
anything to make sure it helps others.

573
02:11:07,262 --> 02:11:14,152
Now for one old man, so many
people, kids.. it's not right!

574
02:11:23,309 --> 02:11:32,028
Father is it you? Is it you?

575
02:11:42,286 --> 02:11:52,696
- I'm Velu here. Is the AC in?
- Father, are you aIright?

576
02:11:55,171 --> 02:12:01,925
He was apparently looking for
me. Tomorrow, is my Neela's..

577
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:12,239
Tomorrow is your mother's
anniversary. Ask him to get me then.

578
02:12:12,417 --> 02:12:17,502
- I won't. - Listen to me.
- Do you know what they would do to you?

579
02:12:17,777 --> 02:12:22,998
- I know. Tell him. - I can't!

580
02:12:30,761 --> 02:12:38,049
Who? Who was on the phone?
Who were you talking to?

581
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:48,703
My father. - Say Velu Naicker.
Why? What does he want?

582
02:12:49,105 --> 02:12:55,962
Does he want to know when
the next raid is? Or where to hide?!

583
02:12:58,260 --> 02:13:05,174
He asked me to bring you. He
told me where he would be tomorrow.

584
02:13:05,353 --> 02:13:05,874
He told you to come there and
arrest him.

585
02:14:47,029 --> 02:14:54,680
You need to testify against
Velu Naicker. - He named my son. I won't.

586
02:15:01,345 --> 02:15:04,774
You knew him for a long time.
You need to testify against him.

587
02:15:44,193 --> 02:15:47,122
You must come and testify for
us.

588
02:15:48,222 --> 02:15:52,149
You don't need to be
scared.We'll protect you.

589
02:15:52,749 --> 02:15:58,902
Don't you know about him? -
Yes, that is why I won't testify.

590
02:16:03,537 --> 02:16:09,224
Your husband? Do you know
who killed him? Do you know?

591
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:16,747
Velu Naicker. - I know.
- Yet you won't testify? - No.

592
02:16:16,887 --> 02:16:24,470
Why? - He gave my son a life
and made him a human being.

593
02:17:09,956 --> 02:17:11,647
Please sit down.

594
02:17:27,036 --> 02:17:34,926
Many have told me you don't
refuse. I need your help.

595
02:17:40,053 --> 02:17:47,966
I am an ordinary man in jail.
You're an officer. How can I help?

596
02:17:48,210 --> 02:17:53,761
I thought you were a cheap
man and I was desparate to put you in jail.

597
02:17:59,364 --> 02:18:05,913
But when I see those who
respect you as their life, I feel I am wrong.

598
02:18:09,085 --> 02:18:13,308
There's one differance
between me and you and what we do.

599
02:18:15,211 --> 02:18:17,639
I do it wearing a uniform and
you don't.

600
02:18:17,874 --> 02:18:25,763
I see that and I need your
help. - You're educated and speak well.

601
02:18:25,998 --> 02:18:35,477
I'm uneducated. I will do what
I can. Tell me what it is.

602
02:18:36,185 --> 02:18:42,440
The verdict is out tomorrow.
But the streets aren't calm.

603
02:18:45,207 --> 02:18:48,692
If we go to stop, unnecessary
lives are being lost.

604
02:18:52,033 --> 02:18:56,051
You must help us to make sure
court runs smoothly tomorrow.

605
02:18:56,194 --> 02:19:01,018
- I.. - I believe you can do it if
you wish to.

606
02:19:08,179 --> 02:19:13,265
The verdict may be against
you. It may even be death.

607
02:19:18,201 --> 02:19:29,951
I should have died at 10. You
won't have trouble tomorrow. go on.

608
02:19:44,003 --> 02:19:50,894
I need another favour. You
must bless your grandson tomorrow.

609
02:22:06,798 --> 02:22:09,885
Why are they keeping you in
jail?

610
02:22:15,154 --> 02:22:18,843
Did you do some wrong?

611
02:22:20,148 --> 02:22:24,008
Are you a good person or a
bad person?

612
02:22:29,203 --> 02:22:33,960
Tell me. Are you a good
person or a bad person?

613
02:22:40,157 --> 02:22:46,343
I don't know.

614
02:22:48,147 --> 02:22:52,165
What is your name?
- Velu. Shakthi Velu.

615
02:23:00,965 --> 02:23:04,586
Do you know my name?
- No I don't.

616
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:10,016
I have your name too. Shakthi
Vel.

617
02:23:53,136 --> 02:23:58,426
You don't worry. Nothing will
happen to you.

618
02:24:03,123 --> 02:24:11,036
You go on. Nothing will
happen.We're here for you!

619
02:25:20,096 --> 02:25:27,543
There wasn't enough
evidence! They can't do anything to him!

620
02:27:22,349 --> 02:27:29,932
Along the streets of the
southern city, the one who came like a deer,

621
02:27:30,073 --> 02:27:36,987
Who had hit you?
