1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,542
23.976

2
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:21,916
Bye! - Bye, mama

3
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,916
Arjun! - Yes, mama.

4
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:28,417
Come here.

5
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,624
You forgot your Tiffin again.
- Sorry, mama.

6
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,708
See, eat the whole Tiffin. Do
not leave half like everyday.

7
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,124
Okay mama.
- Okay, baby.

8
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,749
Love you, darling.
- Love you, mama.

9
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,375
Come on.
- Bye Bobby! - Bye mama.

10
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:50,375
Wow! The handsome hunk is here.

11
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:01,832
I knew that he would
come here and say...

12
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:05,749
...Hello Drishti.
...Hello Drishti.

13
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,999
Hello sir.
- Rahul!

14
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,666
I have told you earlier too.

15
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,083
It feels odd calling you that.

16
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:16,541
Arjun is progressing.
- Thank God.

17
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:18,249
He is the one who is working hard...

18
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,124
...then why should you thank God?

19
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:24,750
I should thank you. You are
the one who is working on him.

20
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,917
Please do not embarrass me.
And if you need anything...

21
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:35,250
...just call me.
- I will. Thanks.

22
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:39,333
We have lost the whole world...
Shut up, Tanya.

23
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:44,125
...in your love... in your love...

24
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,749
Why do you search for a
meaning in everything?

25
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,916
Come on, Drishti! It is
evident that Rahul loves you.

26
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,457
It is nothing like that.

27
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,124
He is just concerned about Arjun.

28
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,249
Even my son Bobby
studies in the same school.

29
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,916
And I was standing just next to you.

30
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,749
But Rahul did not
even look towards me.

31
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,749
Can we please stop this topic
right here and right now? Please.

32
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,415
What is the problem?

33
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,249
Just because you are widow, that...

34
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,916
...does not mean that you
would not marry forever.

35
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,332
I did not say that I will
not marry throughout life.

36
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,249
I do see a second
marriage in my life.

37
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,083
But I cannot see Rahul in that.

38
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:23,166
You have started your ESP things.

39
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:26,792
I can see this. What will
happen further. I feel this.

40
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:30,333
See, Tanya. If you do
not believe it, do not.

41
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,041
But please do not
make a joke out of it.

42
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:36,083
I am sorry, Drishti.

43
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:39,166
Did not I apologize?
- It is okay.

44
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:45,042
By the way, I have to go on
a lunch today, so please...

45
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,207
I will pick Bobby up.
- So sweet!

46
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:53,167
Bye!
- Bye!

47
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:07,249
Tanya, wait!

48
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,374
Why?

49
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,916
Do not even take a step further!

50
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:16,375
Drishti, you and your visions...

51
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:31,875
I do not know how, why. But I
get these visions since birth.

52
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:36,083
Even my grandma has these visions.

53
00:06:36,084 --> 00:06:39,333
Scary, no?
- Yes.

54
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:45,165
Even I was scared at the beginning.

55
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,833
But my grandma says that very few...

56
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:53,250
...people have this boon.
I still remember...

57
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:59,417
...that night in my childhood.

58
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,916
Mama, the plane fell... mama,
the plane fell in the sea.

59
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:43,082
Child, what happened, child?

60
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,916
The plane fell. Three
hundred and fifty people died.

61
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,249
You must have seen a nightmare.
- No...

62
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,416
No! Mama! I am
telling you the truth mama!

63
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:53,290
The plane fell, mama!
- Enough, Drishti.

64
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:59,459
Everything will be all right.
Everything will be all right.

65
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,916
And that same night...

66
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:05,249
Three hundred and fifty people died...

67
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,791
...due to the plane
falling down into the sea.

68
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:19,166
Drishti, I am so nervous.
- I am habituated to it.

69
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,541
Jai was killed in an accident,
is not it?

70
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:24,666
Yes.

71
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:28,207
You did not see that?

72
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,457
I saw that.

73
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:36,000
Jai was very happy that day. He
had got an order of a promotion.

74
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,916
He was to go as a chief engineer...

75
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:45,290
...on a new project to London.

76
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,916
I was very angry.

77
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,958
I did not want to go to London!

78
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,290
We are going to London,
not to Jhumri Tallaya.

79
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,082
There is Oxford there,
Cambridge and...

80
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,541
David Beckham too!

81
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:59,249
I do not like any jokes.

82
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,957
Okay darling!

83
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,208
If it is not in our fate,
we will not go.

84
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,124
Jai had left for the office,
and completing...

85
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,250
...all the tasks of the morning,
I sat in front of the TV.

86
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:25,249
Jai had brought a new
set of Tarot cards for me.

87
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,375
Voodo Tarot cards.

88
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,124
Tell him to call home as soon
as he reaches. It is urgent.

89
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,749
I waited for the
all for half an hour.

90
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,541
And then I realized,
the coming trouble...

91
00:09:59,542 --> 00:10:03,040
...is unknown to the coming trouble.

92
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,416
I called up again.

93
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:07,207
Madam, I had told him.
But he told me...

94
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:11,207
...that I will call up after
starting the work. - Call him, now!

95
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,584
Suraj come in!
- Let it come...

96
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,583
Yes, Neha. - Tell sir that
it is a call from Drishti.

97
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,040
Sir, it is a call from madam.

98
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,249
Tell her not to keep the phone.
I will come in a minute.

99
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,332
Yes, let it come.

100
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,040
Tell madam to hold. Sir
is coming in a minute.

101
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,208
Okay! - Hello... - Tell him to
get out from there right now.

102
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,165
Just now! Right now!

103
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,083
Madam has told him to get
out from there right now...

104
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:42,125
Hello, Jai, are you listening...
hello...

105
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,332
It has been one and
a half year to this.

106
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:03,792
I am absolutely fine now.

107
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,082
You are unwell.

108
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,082
No. I am all right.

109
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,832
Why are you lying? Go to
the doctor today itself.

110
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:35,000
No, I am scared.

111
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,291
There is nothing to worry.

112
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:39,166
There is a little
infection in the kidney.

113
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:44,708
Therefore, there is that bleeding.

114
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:08,917
Take off your glasses.

115
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,166
Take them off.
Nothing is hidden from me.

116
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:18,708
As it is, I can see the swollen lip

117
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:33,416
The matter is worsening day by day.

118
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:36,459
The shampoo in the
house was exhausted.

119
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:40,291
Therefore, I went to buy it.

120
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:43,207
When I came back, I saw that Sunny...

121
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,584
...was waiting for me
with a belt in his hand.

122
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,624
Leave him. I had
told you earlier too.

123
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,291
Sunny will kill me.

124
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,374
He will search me out.

125
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:01,207
Nothing like this will happen.

126
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,374
He has warned me earlier too.

127
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,874
Whatever.

128
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,417
Sunny cannot kill anyone. Ever.

129
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,249
He is just a little insecure.

130
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,249
There was another matter.
- What?

131
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,416
I think that there is
someone else in his life.

132
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:26,791
Yes. I can see it. But
she will not be for long.

133
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,583
Thank God.

134
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:34,249
Your troubles will not be
lessened in spite of that.

135
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,208
Leave Sunny, Riya.
- But...

136
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:48,708
Hello. - I am speaking from the
school. Will you come the school?

137
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:52,167
I have to talk about Arjun.
- I am coming right away.

138
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:04,167
Come, Drishti. Come. Have a seat.
- Where is Arjun?

139
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:10,249
Do not worry,
Drishti. Please have a seat.

140
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,666
See. He understands his mistake too.

141
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,708
But the way he hit that boy...
- Did Arjun fight again?

142
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,500
Yes. He has a lot
of anger inside him.

143
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:25,416
Jai died a year and a half back.

144
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:29,416
He has not come out of
that shock till today.

145
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:32,374
What if he is shown
to some psychiatrist?

146
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,749
Arjun does not need a psychiatrist.

147
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,458
I was just thinking. If he...

148
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,583
Good morning, Rahul!

149
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:40,957
I am so sorry.

150
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,291
I did not know that
someone is with you.

151
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:45,291
No, it is okay. Please, come in.

152
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:49,333
Ruby was not outside,
so I came inside.

153
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:51,999
Ruby is on a holiday.

154
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,416
She is sick since two days.
- It is okay.

155
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:03,208
Drishti, this is Natasha.
- Fiancée of Rahul.

156
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:09,416
Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

157
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:11,749
Please go out for two minutes.
It is something very important.

158
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,416
I am so sorry. Please take your time.

159
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:16,542
No. You wait. People
are waiting at home.

160
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:21,665
I will speak to Arjun.

161
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,790
Are you that astrologer?

162
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,957
Not exactly.

163
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,624
I read cards and show the future.

164
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,707
Really? What do you think about us?

165
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:39,166
Are we a match made in heaven?

166
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,416
What happened?

167
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:26,416
Any problem?
- No.

168
00:16:26,417 --> 00:16:32,125
You guys are really
made for each other.

169
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,707
I am sorry, mama.

170
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,916
Why do you do like this?

171
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:50,666
That Bunty called you a witch.
I became angry.

172
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:56,708
If he calls you a witch again,
I will hit him again.

173
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:12,082
Good morning, Mohit!

174
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:15,375
Hey, friend! You have come so early.

175
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,458
Your car...

176
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,582
...is not ready yet.
- It is okay.

177
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,708
I was returning from school.
I thought of taking a chance.

178
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:29,708
One... no, it will take one and a
half hour. I will paint it now.

179
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:32,582
Okay. I will come in the evening.

180
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,082
No. I will reach it. Home.

181
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,749
Thanks. I will leave.

182
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,582
Hey, friend.

183
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:44,499
Where are you going?
- Home, where else?

184
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,582
Just a minute.

185
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:51,042
I will drop you home. In my car.

186
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,875
Laxman, look after the garage, okay?

187
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,499
I just had to change the door lock.

188
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,749
What was the need to paint it?

189
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,792
It seemed very bad. Do
not take any tension.

190
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:13,540
I will not charge any money.
- Why?

191
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:17,792
Why! You did so much for me.
Did you ever take money?

192
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,540
And then...

193
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:24,750
I have just one friend in
this world. Right, friend?

194
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:32,540
You are in a very good mood today?

195
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:38,084
I get nice thoughts.
Nowadays. I was very happy yesterday.

196
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,540
Is it so?

197
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:44,540
I did not even need
to take the medicine.

198
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,999
But... I did take it.

199
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,582
It has become a habit now.

200
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:52,084
Now, I will have to take a
medicine to leave the habit.

201
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,582
You will be perfectly all right now.

202
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,875
If you say so, yes. I believe you.

203
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:05,665
I was very happy yesterday.

204
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:10,458
But today...

205
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,625
But today...

206
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,749
What happened? Mohit?

207
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,792
You will have to tell me. Right now.
- What?

208
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:34,000
Will I die if I kill the bullock?

209
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,666
Which bullock are you talking about?

210
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:40,167
You tell me! Will I die
if I kill the bullock?

211
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,582
No. No. You will not die.

212
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:49,874
Thank God. I was so scared.

213
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:56,500
If you said that I would die,
I would commit suicide.

214
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:03,624
I was scared. Thank God.

215
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,624
This is so dirty. Wait.

216
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,083
Take this.

217
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:14,624
No...
- Take it.

218
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,624
This will be dirty too.

219
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:22,542
Childishness again?

220
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:30,208
Is it okay?
- Yes.

221
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,666
Is it all right?

222
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,666
You do not need to drop me home.

223
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:45,583
I will go... - No. I am all right.
I was so happy... shall we go?

224
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,666
You had scared me.

225
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:03,250
Will you marry me?

226
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:09,625
Did not I scare you?

227
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:18,250
Here, the house has come. I
am very happy. Like yesterday.

228
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:23,958
Thank you, Mohit.

229
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:27,124
Friend.

230
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:32,250
I will wash and return this to you.

231
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,749
Drishti!

232
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,124
Grandma!

233
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:48,667
Daughter!

234
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,457
You have not changed
in one and a half year.

235
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,749
Grandma, you here, all of a sudden?

236
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:59,625
Child, I missed you.
Therefore, I came here.

237
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,166
Hey, what are you staring at?

238
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:07,041
Grandma, I am happy that you came.

239
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:12,166
Is it so? See. I brought sweets.
Your favorites. See.

240
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,749
Grandma...

241
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,749
I am feeling so good seeing you.

242
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,749
Come on! Come on!

243
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,749
Oh! It is about to rain.

244
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,999
Rain? The sky is so clear.

245
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,250
Do not argue with me.
Come on! Come on.

246
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:34,334
Come, grandma.

247
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:38,791
What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

248
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:44,208
Where is Arjun?
- He is in the school.

249
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:46,791
A difficult time is about to pass.

250
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,916
What are you saying, grandma?

251
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:53,875
Listen to the inner voice.
- What do you mean?

252
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:57,375
I mean... I am yearning
for tea since morning.

253
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,084
Come on.
- No. You bring the tea and...

254
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:05,375
Where is your TV?
- It is in this room.

255
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:09,875
You bring the tea and I
will watch TV. Take this.

256
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:15,208
Come on, I will come right away.

257
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,499
And yes! Put some sugar in the tea!

258
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,374
And your diabetes?

259
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:33,708
It does not matter any longer.

260
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,916
Did not I tell you?

261
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:51,208
You are amazing, grandma!

262
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:55,250
Three new messages. Friday, 2 pm.

263
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,582
Hi Drishti, this is Tanya.

264
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:01,500
Actually, I have a date. I am
going to dinner with Santosh.

265
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,582
The same business manager.

266
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:09,958
You know. I will leave
Bobby at your place.

267
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:14,750
She will not change herself.

268
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,624
Hi Drishti, this is Rahul.

269
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:21,124
I should not have disturbed
you by telling about Arjun.

270
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,249
But he is fine now. Bye, take care.

271
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:30,042
Come on, Rahul. Whom
are you speaking to?

272
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:40,208
Drishti my child, I am papa.
There is a bad news.

273
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:44,959
Your grandma expired a while ago.

274
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:22,249
I do not believe it. Why
did grandma come here?

275
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,833
To warn me.

276
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:30,624
I think, something
is about to happen.

277
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:35,375
What?

278
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:39,624
Is this an old photo of grandma?

279
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:45,750
No. Grandma used to look like this.

280
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:49,250
And this, mummy daddy?
- Yes.

281
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:58,875
And, who is this?

282
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,416
Yes, Manav.

283
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:08,709
My friend, philosopher, guide...

284
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:12,749
...my bouncing board.

285
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,749
Stop!

286
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,040
Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait!

287
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:21,374
What happen?
- I want to have a coffee.

288
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:24,249
You are impossible!
- Even then, I want to have a coffee.

289
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,791
We have to go to the
hotel and pack up.

290
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,833
Even then, I want a coffee.

291
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:31,791
Here is the coffee for you sir.

292
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:36,583
Anything else?
- No.

293
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:46,124
What is the matter?

294
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,791
Why are you so restless?

295
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:51,207
I have to reach India and
prepare certificates and documents.

296
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:54,375
Why? - I have to go to the
US consulate for the visa.

297
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:59,208
Yes. I have got a
scholarship from Wharton university.

298
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:01,915
Refuse it.
- What?

299
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:04,040
What will I do if you go to America?

300
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,249
And lose such a great opportunity?

301
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,749
Did Dhirubhai Ambani go to America?

302
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,165
Drishti...
- Shut up!

303
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:16,375
You are not leaving me
and going anywhere. Okay?

304
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,499
Hi mom! HI dad!
- Hi sweetheart!

305
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,833
Did you come?

306
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:32,750
No. I am in the college. What stands
before you is your misconception.

307
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,249
Shut up! I do not want
to listen to your PJs.

308
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,333
Okay. I will change.
- Where are you going? Sit here.

309
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:43,292
What happened? Is the dress short?
- Sit down.

310
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,292
Do you know that Manav
is going to America?

311
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:55,083
Yes. I have warned him.
I will break his legs.

312
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:59,083
He will go to America and
his legs will be safe too.

313
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,457
How is that?

314
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:04,250
Manav wants to marry you.
- What?

315
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,915
I cannot marry Manav.
- What?

316
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:11,166
What is to be surprised in this?

317
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,249
Manav is a good friend of mine.

318
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,915
But I cannot see my husband in him.

319
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:19,125
What is this madness?
You explain her, please.

320
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,292
Just a minute. If she
does not want to marry...

321
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,915
...do not force her to.
- But... mother...

322
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:28,125
Child... go, child go.
- Thank you, grandma.

323
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:33,541
But...

324
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,166
Mother, you are at her side too?

325
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:40,542
Manav is such a good boy, it
is a good house, it is a good...

326
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:44,041
Son. You did not hear
Drishti out completely.

327
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:49,000
She did not say that she
does not want to marry Manav.

328
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,915
She has said that she cannot see...

329
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:58,040
...her husband in Manav.

330
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:02,917
Is not seen...

331
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,416
Where is Manav now?

332
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:17,957
Some where in America.
- America!

333
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:20,957
Is he rich?
- Why?

334
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:23,249
He can be my third husband,
is not it?

335
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,082
Why the third?

336
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:30,875
I will divorce the second.

337
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:34,040
Right now, the person whom you want...

338
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,583
...to divorce is
waiting for you at lunch.

339
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:39,082
Oh my God! Sandy is going to kill me.

340
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:44,375
Bye, I will leave.
- Bye!

341
00:29:55,584 --> 00:30:00,084
Who is it?

342
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,999
Madam. Please open the door.
It is something important.

343
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,292
Please... Please
open the door. Please.

344
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:14,999
I am Sunny.

345
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,041
I am sorry. I am troubling
you so late in the night.

346
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:22,041
But... you know my wife.

347
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:24,041
Yes.

348
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:25,583
I know her and you too.

349
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:29,083
Can I come inside? I
wished to speak about Rhiya

350
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:31,207
Something has happened to her.

351
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:34,041
What has happened to her?
Is she all right?

352
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:37,417
No, Madam. I will not
take much of your time.

353
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:48,834
Come.

354
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:27,082
You were about to say something.

355
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:31,082
Riya has gone crazy nowadays.

356
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:35,666
Actually... a witch
has made her crazy.

357
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:43,249
I know that she
comes here. To meet you.

358
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,584
And you play your black magic on her.

359
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:54,374
You instigate her against me.

360
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:58,583
You are jealous
seeing any married woman.

361
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:06,834
You are a widow, after all.

362
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:11,124
Do you see this?

363
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:14,208
If you even try to
meet Riya after today...

364
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:20,417
...I will pierce so many pins
into it that you will find it...

365
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:25,124
...difficult to walk on
your legs in the morning.

366
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:27,124
Did you understand?

367
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:29,749
Did you understand that?

368
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,249
Mama!
- Go inside.

369
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,582
You love your child a lot, is not it?

370
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:42,582
The father is not there.

371
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:46,125
He needs the mother now, is it not?

372
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,166
Is it not?

373
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,416
What is your name?

374
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:55,166
Hey! What is your name?
- Get out from here.

375
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:58,166
Do not you dare to
threaten my child or me.

376
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:03,249
What I do here, is
my personal matter.

377
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,083
If your wife has even a
little bit of sense she will not...

378
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:10,208
...see the face of such
a wretch like you ever!

379
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:11,707
Get out of here.

380
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,540
Otherwise, I will call the police.

381
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:19,583
And you will rot in
prison all through your life.

382
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:34,833
You will writhe and die. You witch.

383
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:44,417
Your mother is a ghost. A ghost.

384
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:51,166
Go away from here.

385
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:01,416
I had kept the ring
there while I was bathing.

386
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:07,792
My husband will be very
angry if I do not get it.

387
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,541
It has not been stolen.
The ring is in the house.

388
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,582
I have searched for it all over.

389
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:19,707
Go and search for it again.
You will get it.

390
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:24,625
Thank you.

391
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:49,916
I want to apologize
for actions of Sunny.

392
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:54,250
It is okay. I can take
care of myself. Go now.

393
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:58,291
It was become imperative
that I should speak to you.

394
00:34:58,292 --> 00:35:01,291
If not here, we can
go somewhere else.

395
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:04,291
The matter is very serious.

396
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:08,875
Sit down.

397
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:18,333
I am reading the cards
the last time for you.

398
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:20,624
If you do not listen
to me this time too...

399
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:23,333
I... I cannot leave Sunny.

400
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:25,333
How can I make you understand, Riya?

401
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:27,540
He will keep on hitting you.

402
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:33,209
But... but... I do not
have anyone except him too.

403
00:35:34,084 --> 00:35:35,916
Cannot you do something, so that...

404
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:39,333
...Sunny is freed from
the clutches of that witch?

405
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:42,750
If he is freed from her,
someone else will come.

406
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:47,875
But...

407
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:57,457
It is Sunny! It is Sunny!
- Cool down!

408
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,540
I will call the police. Nothing
will happen. - No! You won't do that!

409
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,707
If you are my friend!
- Riya! Don't worry! Trust me!

410
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:04,374
No! Please! No! He will kill me.

411
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:10,374
Nothing will happen to you.
Cool down, Riya!

412
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,916
Sunny, wait. Wait.

413
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:17,374
You will not change, will you?

414
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:21,250
I had told you, is not it? I
had told you! I had told you!

415
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:23,624
What did I tell you?

416
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:26,415
Sunny! Please, listen! Wait! Please!
- I had told you...

417
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:31,415
Do not come here. I will
break your legs! Come from here!

418
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:32,791
Sunny! No! Please!

419
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:35,749
Sit in the car! Sit inside!
- Please forgive me!

420
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,916
I will not come back here, ever!

421
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:42,292
If you come back here,
I will break your legs!

422
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:54,083
This Drishti too! How late she is!

423
00:36:54,084 --> 00:36:57,415
Come fast, Drishti!
- Yes, I am coming.

424
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,041
I will come back by ten thirty.

425
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:02,415
No problem. Take your time.

426
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,874
Do not trouble aunty.

427
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:08,707
Be a good boy. Okay?
- Okay, mama.

428
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:11,833
I am coming. This girl too! Bye!
- Bye mama.

429
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:19,499
What were you doing? Come quickly.

430
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,832
You are so impatient!

431
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,083
We will be late for
the party, come on.

432
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:24,415
I do not know why you
are going to the party.

433
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,832
So that you do not stay
home and become a mendicant.

434
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:29,917
See, all the men will fall
looking at you in the party.

435
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:32,124
Do you think any
thing else except men?

436
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,208
Obviously not!
- You and your one track mind.

437
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:37,124
More the merrier.

438
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,457
See, the whole city
will be present there.

439
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,624
In which joy is this party thrown?

440
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,124
The music album of
daughter of Raj Bahadur...

441
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,749
...has been released today.

442
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,749
Three cheers for Natasha!

443
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:52,208
Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

444
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,582
Today is a joyous day for me.

445
00:37:56,583 --> 00:38:00,457
My childhood dream of my
daughter is being fulfilled today.

446
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,457
She was all of six years when she...

447
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:07,541
...has stammered and told
me to get her a piano.

448
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,499
Hi darling!
- Hi!

449
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,999
Today, I can say this with pride...

450
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,499
Drishti meet Sandy!

451
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,083
He is business
manager of Raj Bahadur.

452
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:15,666
...that I listened to
my daughter that day.

453
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,499
He is the reason for
leaving Bobby in your house.

454
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,499
Otherwise, how would the
world hear her melodious voice?

455
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,166
Just a minute.

456
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,499
I remember, when I was young...

457
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,999
Darling, would you get me a drink?

458
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,499
Just a minute, I will
get it for you right now.

459
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,832
...I was very much
interested in listening to songs.

460
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,875
Sister Lata, Asha, Geeta Dutt...
- He is a bore.

461
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,916
Even then, four times
lunch in a week. - Alampara...

462
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:36,666
He is rich!
- Shamshad Begum.

463
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:40,207
Noor Jahan!
- Suraiya is left.

464
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,791
Yes, Suraiya too.

465
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:46,541
Today, I feel strange thinking that...

466
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:49,583
...the people will listen
to Natasha on the radio too.

467
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,958
Someone is staring at you.

468
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,541
Who?

469
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:06,500
To your right.

470
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:10,874
Today, on this joyous occasion...

471
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:14,541
...I want to give you
one more good news.

472
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:17,582
On the fifteenth of the next month...

473
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,707
...with great pomp and splendor...

474
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:23,582
...I am about to
marry my daughter off.

475
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:26,999
With the most eligible
bachelor of this city.

476
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,292
Rahul, will you
please come on the stage.

477
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,124
Maybe, you people do not know it.

478
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:49,249
Father of Rahul was
my political teacher.

479
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,582
Our party was established.

480
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,582
The year was 1974.

481
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:55,916
It was the month of January.

482
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:59,667
It was very cold. Bracing the cold...

483
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,042
...we had taken out our
first demonstration.

484
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:06,582
We wished...

485
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,707
People are getting bored.

486
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,582
Okay.

487
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:15,582
I will not waste more
of your precious time.

488
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:19,834
I request my to be
son-in-law and the to be mayor...

489
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:23,624
...that he say a few words to you.

490
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:29,375
Friends, let us enjoy!

491
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:03,542
' It is our day, it is our night.'

492
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:08,959
'Whatever it is, it
is in our matter now.'

493
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:24,417
'Tiro, how much I love you!"

494
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:46,250
'We have a different
attitude of living.'

495
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:53,000
'We have different
loyalty in death, isn't it? '

496
00:42:55,875 --> 00:43:05,709
' Everything is in our hands.
We will break every custom.'

497
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:10,332
' Is it not? '

498
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:14,709
'The heart is crazy, and
with that, we are crazy too.'

499
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:20,041
'Whatever it is, it is our love.'

500
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:55,915
Come on, kiss me, Abhi!

501
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:57,332
That is it, someone will come.

502
00:43:57,333 --> 00:44:02,708
Nobody will come. Everybody is busy.

503
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:07,082
Stop it.

504
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:12,209
Kiss me, now!

505
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,874
Were you bored?

506
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,291
Yes.

507
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:36,083
Even I am bored. Can I seat?
- Yes, sure.

508
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:46,999
You are looking very beautiful.

509
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,999
What are you doing outside?

510
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,292
I am searching for Natasha.
I do not know where she is.

511
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:00,292
What are your thoughts?
About Natasha?

512
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,915
She is beautiful.

513
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:08,082
No, she is very beautiful.

514
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,249
She is a chirp too.

515
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,833
Lively.

516
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:25,374
I do not have a
habit of wearing heels.

517
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,249
You look beautiful anyways.

518
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:32,583
Why are you embarrassing me?
- Really.

519
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:35,833
You are here. I was
worried searching for you.

520
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:39,541
Even I was searching for you.
Where did you go?

521
00:45:39,542 --> 00:45:43,915
Rest room!

522
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:46,207
Do you know Drishti?

523
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:49,915
Of course. You look very beautiful.

524
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:53,291
Did not I tell you?

525
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,416
Were you two talking
something important?

526
00:45:56,417 --> 00:45:58,624
Not at all.

527
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:02,250
Papa was asking for you.
I am going. You come.

528
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:04,957
Wait. I will come too.

529
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:09,249
See you, Drishti.
- Okay, bye.

530
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:15,042
Come.
- I was missing you, Rahul.

531
00:46:17,584 --> 00:46:19,583
Here. Mama has come.

532
00:46:19,584 --> 00:46:22,875
Body of Narsi Patel was
found eighty kms from Surat...

533
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:26,082
Did he irritate you?

534
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,999
The police says that this is not
the case for the local police...

535
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,249
...but the rural police.
- Come on.

536
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:33,875
Do you know, mama.
That food was so bad...

537
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,082
...I just hid them beneath the table.

538
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:40,332
You rogue. One does not do like this.

539
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:45,708
Come on. We will sleep quickly.

540
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,416
Mama, who is at home?

541
00:46:58,417 --> 00:47:03,375
You stay here.

542
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:45,124
See. Drishti. Sunny is a
very good friend of mine.

543
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:47,749
We two play golf
together many a times.

544
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,541
I do not think that he
will do anything like this.

545
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:51,790
I am sure that this is
the handiwork of Sunny.

546
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:53,541
But, why will he do
something like this?

547
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:56,249
He thinks that I wish
to break his marriage.

548
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,124
Which you are not doing.

549
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:01,874
He... he hits Riya everyday.

550
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,458
See...

551
00:49:03,459 --> 00:49:07,042
It is not proper for you to
meddle in their private matter.

552
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,707
Anyways...

553
00:49:08,708 --> 00:49:11,416
I will call Sunny to the
police station and question him.

554
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:16,208
Thank you.

555
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,249
By the way...

556
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,790
Sunny has registered a complaint...

557
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:27,166
...against you four days ago.

558
00:49:53,459 --> 00:49:55,624
Hey, friend!
- Hi, Mohit.

559
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,874
All of a sudden? Did
your car conk down?

560
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:02,208
Why? Cannot I come to
meet you just like that?

561
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:07,166
Come, come. Come.

562
00:50:13,459 --> 00:50:17,625
I was thinking about
it too, since morning.

563
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:23,666
No, since yesterday. To meet you.
- Why?

564
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,582
I feel like...

565
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:41,458
...there is a stonewall.
I cannot break it.

566
00:50:43,334 --> 00:50:48,333
It is blocked. Totally blocked.

567
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:50,249
It is in the head.

568
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:55,167
I do not understand the difference...

569
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,292
...between the mind
and the head at all.

570
00:51:00,292 --> 00:51:03,916
All go through this
phase some time or the other.

571
00:51:03,917 --> 00:51:08,667
But I...

572
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:12,249
I go through this every day.

573
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:15,249
What is this?
- No.

574
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:16,874
Tell me.

575
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,707
No. Nothing.

576
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:24,166
Would not you show it to your friend?

577
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:44,041
Did you fight with father again?

578
00:51:44,416 --> 00:51:49,833
Yes. I had brought flowers for you.

579
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:57,292
He threw them away.

580
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:01,333
Whatever I liked since childhood...

581
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:04,916
...he snatched it away from me.

582
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:08,333
Do you hate him a lot?

583
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:09,999
No.

584
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,582
He is good.

585
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:15,916
After the death of my father,
he looked after the house.

586
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:19,875
He looked after mother too.

587
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:24,750
All children are beaten
with a belt, is not it?

588
00:52:26,334 --> 00:52:29,333
In childhood?

589
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:33,916
See, look at this. He hit me.

590
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:37,041
All kids undergo this.

591
00:52:37,042 --> 00:52:39,374
Will you have some tea?

592
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:43,667
No. I want to talk to you.
- With me?

593
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:51,916
About your father.

594
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:56,667
What can I say? You speak.
You speak. You speak!

595
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:06,792
Why do I hate my father? Why!

596
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:18,666
I am sorry.

597
00:53:18,667 --> 00:53:23,458
I shouted at you. Go. Go.

598
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:28,999
You can go.
- It is alright.

599
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:36,625
If I kill the buffalo, I will die.
I think about it everyday.

600
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:42,708
If you speak clearly,
I will help you.

601
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:50,415
I will try.

602
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:52,958
Yes.

603
00:53:52,959 --> 00:53:56,707
I am happy.

604
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:59,415
I will take the medicine too.

605
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:02,083
I am happy.

606
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:04,707
Will you have some tea, friend?

607
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:09,208
Yes.

608
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:15,540
Two teas! Quickly, okay?
- Yes.

609
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:20,208
I am happy.

610
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,582
Till when will you see the TV?
Do you not have to sleep?

611
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:40,625
Do you not have to
go to school? Come on!

612
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,958
The things that I
broke in your house...

613
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:05,125
...there were some
expensive things amongst them too.

614
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,582
But...

615
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:11,375
I think that some of
them are left. Yes...

616
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,708
Have you ever seen a
butcher cut a chicken?

617
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:25,542
He cuts the neck too with such love.

618
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:29,416
And then, he fleeces the chicken.

619
00:55:30,542 --> 00:55:36,084
Just like that, I will
fleece you and your loved child.

620
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:40,000
Lf... you complain
to the police again.

621
00:55:40,542 --> 00:55:42,624
Understood?

622
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:43,874
Understood?

623
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:48,417
Understood?

624
00:55:54,542 --> 00:56:00,083
What happened, mama?

625
00:56:08,583 --> 00:56:10,874
Why did you keep the bat there?

626
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:13,666
I will practice if
I do not get sleep.

627
00:56:13,667 --> 00:56:19,625
Come on, sleep.

628
00:56:23,834 --> 00:56:27,458
Mama, please put the lights off.
- I will.

629
00:57:50,917 --> 00:57:52,916
Open up.

630
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:57,666
I am coming!

631
00:57:57,667 --> 00:57:59,666
What happened?

632
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:01,249
There is some good news.

633
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,666
Good news?

634
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:05,959
Yes. Natasha has disappeared.
- What?

635
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:09,249
She has not come home since two days.

636
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,708
So, she must have gone with someone.

637
00:58:11,709 --> 00:58:14,874
No, Sandy was saying that
Raj Bahadur is very disturbed.

638
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:17,040
He is looking for her everywhere.

639
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:19,207
Is this any good news?
- Obviously.

640
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:21,708
There is no wall left
between you and Rahul.

641
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:26,958
I do not have time to
listen to your stupidity.

642
00:58:26,959 --> 00:58:32,583
I just came here to inform you.

643
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:45,625
The father and daughter
would never be on talking terms.

644
00:58:45,834 --> 00:58:47,749
There would be fights everyday,
is it not, Tania? - Shut up!

645
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,959
Natasha did not leave
the house because of that.

646
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:56,792
She knew that Rahul did not
love her. Is it not, Drishti?

647
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:04,125
Please, keep me away
from this discussion.

648
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,833
It is four days past.
I do not know in...

649
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:10,749
...what situation and
where my daughter is.

650
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:13,834
Have you asked all your relatives?
- Yes.

651
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:25,874
Did you have any fight with her?

652
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:31,207
I did not even meet her that day.

653
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:33,749
Hello!

654
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:40,167
Okay. Okay.

655
00:59:40,709 --> 00:59:42,291
Whose phone was it?

656
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:45,749
It was one of the friend of Natasha.

657
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:49,000
She has a program tomorrow evening.
At the Green hills.

658
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:51,957
I will go.

659
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:56,708
Okay.

660
01:00:35,834 --> 01:00:41,709
' He is crazy for me!
He is crazy for me! '

661
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:53,041
'AII the unmarried people say this... '

662
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:57,208
'When will I ebb out? '

663
01:00:57,375 --> 01:01:00,750
'Oh what a babe! '

664
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:39,833
' I am a dream of open eyes,
and the season of open arms.'

665
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:58,791
'One on gaze of yours,
my heart goes afire.'

666
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:10,500
'Oh what a babe! '

667
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:20,333
'Say what. I like that.'

668
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:41,125
I have not met her since three days.

669
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:48,040
What happened, Rahul?

670
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:52,208
Jennifer was saying that she has not
met Natasha in the last three months.

671
01:02:57,417 --> 01:03:00,166
Everything will be all right.

672
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:03,875
We could have won today.
Do you know that? - How?

673
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:07,875
If you would pass me the ball,
I would have hit the goal.

674
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,875
I thought that I would hit the goal.
- You are the limit!

675
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:19,542
Hey, kids! Wait. Where are you going?

676
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:26,625
Sit in the car. I will
drop you. Sit in the car.

677
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:31,082
No.

678
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:35,875
Are you scared? Yes?
Come here. Come here.

679
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:39,041
Come here!

680
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:42,542
Does Riya come here?
To meet your mother?

681
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:48,625
What did I ask you? Does Riya come?

682
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:53,666
Hey! Answer me! Give me
the cap. Give me the cap!

683
01:03:55,584 --> 01:04:00,416
Give it to me.

684
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:08,374
I feel pity on you.

685
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:12,584
Your mother is a witch.
What is she, she is a witch.

686
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:17,584
If she does not
stop her black magic...

687
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:21,041
...she will be burnt. She
will be turned into ashes.

688
01:04:21,042 --> 01:04:26,625
There is no father,
there is no mother too.

689
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,041
Very sad.

690
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:38,041
Get lost!

691
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:41,249
Is everything all right?

692
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:47,041
He is saying that mother is a
witch and she will get burnt.

693
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:51,000
Okay. Is that what he said?

694
01:04:54,083 --> 01:05:00,166
He said like that?

695
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:12,834
Go. You go.

696
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:15,207
You said like that?

697
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:17,207
Hey, you lunatic. Do
not meddle in my affairs.

698
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:19,541
Come on, run away
from here. Run away.

699
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:22,333
That is what I am doing.

700
01:05:22,334 --> 01:05:25,708
Did not I tell you to
run away? Go from here! Go!

701
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:30,875
Get aside!

702
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:37,042
You said that!

703
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:53,000
You will shoot? Shoot me. Shoot me.

704
01:05:55,125 --> 01:06:00,583
Shoot! Shoot!

705
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:15,875
Dog!

706
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:17,665
He goes to play football everyday.

707
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,249
How was I supposed to know?

708
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:20,749
How did you not know that?

709
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:24,459
Okay. I will be careful in future.
- You should be!

710
01:06:31,209 --> 01:06:36,750
He did not care for me. My father.

711
01:06:37,209 --> 01:06:43,750
Nobody cared... about me.

712
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:48,291
Not even my mother.

713
01:06:48,292 --> 01:06:54,583
You should... be careful.

714
01:06:56,209 --> 01:07:02,250
The... phone...

715
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:11,208
Hello.
- I am Raj Bahadur speaking.

716
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:19,292
Rahul told us that you could help us.

717
01:07:20,209 --> 01:07:23,833
All our tries have
been useless till now.

718
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:28,208
I think that we are wasting our time.

719
01:07:28,209 --> 01:07:31,458
When our whole police force
could not search Natasha...

720
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:35,500
...will this woman be able to
find her with black magic?

721
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:38,374
I did not invite you here.

722
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:41,374
Therefore, you do not have a right...

723
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,374
...to speak about what I do here.

724
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:46,500
I do not need to find out
from you what my rights are.

725
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:49,665
Ranvir, please. We have come here...

726
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:52,540
...because you could not do that task.

727
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:55,707
Ok, go ahead.

728
01:07:55,708 --> 01:08:01,333
Sorry, Drishti.
- It is okay.

729
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:13,208
Please take out
seven cards out of this.

730
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,875
With whom was Natasha the last time?

731
01:08:23,292 --> 01:08:26,334
I think that we
should ask the questions.

732
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:31,874
She had called me on Friday night.

733
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:35,540
She was supposed to come
to my home the next day.

734
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:38,415
That night, she went
to the home of a friend.

735
01:08:38,416 --> 01:08:40,540
I think that someone
has kidnapped her.

736
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:43,333
I do not think so.
- Do you see it there?

737
01:08:43,334 --> 01:08:46,333
Ranvir, please.

738
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:49,665
If he stays here, I will
not be able to concentrate.

739
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:53,209
Sorry, I will not be going anywhere.
I am in charge of this case.

740
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:57,375
Ranvir, will you please stay quiet?
- Ok.

741
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:25,458
There is a lake. There
are many flowers there.

742
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:30,749
There is a broken fence there too.

743
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:33,833
Do you know how many
places are there like that?

744
01:10:34,541 --> 01:10:37,667
Did you have a fight with Natasha?
- Yes.

745
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:40,415
But not that day.

746
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:42,540
I think that we are wasting our time.

747
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:44,749
You are crossing your limits, Ranvir.

748
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:46,874
We have come here for your assurance.

749
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:52,542
Not for your investigations.
- Ok.

750
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:56,624
Sorry, Drishti. You
were saying something.

751
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:59,457
I cannot see anything else.

752
01:10:59,458 --> 01:11:04,540
I hope that Natasha is found soon.

753
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:09,375
Thank you.

754
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:30,208
Thank you.

755
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:37,833
That was a dangerous sight.

756
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:43,292
A chain was on her body.
The bloodied Natasha...

757
01:15:43,709 --> 01:15:47,625
As if she was swimming on
the tree and then suddenly...

758
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,708
Will you have a cake?

759
01:15:49,709 --> 01:15:53,708
No.

760
01:15:53,709 --> 01:15:56,708
Okay.

761
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:58,916
Now, I will have to
investigate dreams?

762
01:15:58,917 --> 01:16:03,333
Natasha is dead, ACP. And
her body is in that lake.

763
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:07,749
In a lake?
- Believe me.

764
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:10,207
Do you know such a place?

765
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,082
There are many places like that.
Where will we search?

766
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:16,749
A person plays a violin there.

767
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:18,915
I know him since many years.

768
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:20,374
But he cannot kill anyone.

769
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:25,332
He is not the killer but who
stays in the neighborhood?

770
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:28,709
Sunny has a property nearby.

771
01:16:32,375 --> 01:16:37,209
Do you know him?

772
01:17:54,125 --> 01:17:56,207
Good morning, sir.
- Do you have the search warrant?

773
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:58,374
Nothing should be illegal.

774
01:17:58,375 --> 01:18:00,874
The owner has given us permission.

775
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:02,207
Has Sunny given us permission?

776
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:04,457
No. The wife of Sunny has.

777
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:10,250
Sunny is out from
yesterday night. Will be late

778
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,125
I think we are wasting our time.
It has been two hours.

779
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:23,416
I know.

780
01:18:23,417 --> 01:18:26,874
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

781
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:29,166
Any problem, sir?

782
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:33,166
There are some
investigations going on.

783
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:36,791
Did you find out
anything about Natasha? - No.

784
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:44,875
If I could do anything, sir?
- Thank you.

785
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:07,915
How long will it take?
- I cannot say anything.

786
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:11,040
You had said that it would
take only ten to fifteen minutes.

787
01:19:11,041 --> 01:19:12,874
Only a little bit more.

788
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:17,499
Hey, I think that something is here.

789
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:21,957
Sir, something is here, sir.

790
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:28,375
Come on. Yes come on!

791
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:47,333
False alarm, sir.

792
01:19:50,417 --> 01:19:52,249
Hey, did anyone bring tea and coffee?

793
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,583
Sir, the tea as well as
the biscuits are in the car.

794
01:19:54,584 --> 01:19:58,875
Sir, coffee or tea? Come.

795
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:25,124
When Natasha asked about
us in school that day...

796
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:28,417
...you had a strange
reaction on your face.

797
01:20:29,042 --> 01:20:35,250
Did you know of the
impending danger? - No.

798
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:47,416
Stop!

799
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:53,624
Here. The trouble has come.

800
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:58,499
Sunny, listen to me. They...

801
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,041
ACP Ranvir, What are
you doing on my property?

802
01:21:01,042 --> 01:21:03,041
Investigation.
- Investigation?

803
01:21:03,042 --> 01:21:06,166
Riya has given the permission.
- No, Sunny.

804
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:09,333
Do you think that I
would give her so much right?

805
01:21:09,334 --> 01:21:15,125
What is that scratch on your hand?

806
01:21:16,042 --> 01:21:18,166
It was a cat. A wild one.

807
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:21,166
Forget that. Get lost from here.

808
01:21:21,167 --> 01:21:23,207
I have orders. Orders
from the Commissioner.

809
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:29,208
All the lakes of the
city have to be checked.

810
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:33,666
I knew that she is the
cause of all this trouble.

811
01:21:35,042 --> 01:21:41,084
You witch! You will not leave me!

812
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:51,416
Sunny, I said. Stop it.

813
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:53,082
I will not spare you!

814
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:58,500
Sir, I think we have found her.

815
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:30,541
I did not do anything!

816
01:22:30,542 --> 01:22:33,665
I did not do anything!

817
01:22:33,666 --> 01:22:36,707
Shrivastav, come here!
- She framed me!

818
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:43,041
Take him away.
- I did not do anything.

819
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:19,083
It was very bad with Natasha.
She was a nice girl.

820
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:23,083
And such a death? Why?

821
01:23:24,292 --> 01:23:28,832
It was fated to be so.

822
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:33,665
Raj Bahadur is broken.

823
01:23:33,666 --> 01:23:36,791
Two years ago wife, and now this.

824
01:23:38,334 --> 01:23:43,125
Why does all this happen with
good people? Belief gets destroyed.

825
01:23:46,209 --> 01:23:51,166
Such things will take place.

826
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:57,625
This is the biggest
truth of life. Death.

827
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:04,625
Excuse me. I am Drishti Nair.
- Sir, Ms. Nair is here to see you.

828
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:10,792
Yes, sir. You may go in, madam.

829
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:20,166
Excuse me.
- Have seat please.

830
01:24:22,708 --> 01:24:28,000
Will you have some coffee?

831
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:36,834
I asked you. Will you have
some coffee? - No thanks.

832
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:44,208
Yeah, Ajay. One black
coffee please. Thanks.

833
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:47,583
Yes?
- You have called me. - Oh yeah.

834
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:53,875
I'm the public prosecutor in the
murder case of the mayor's daughter.

835
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:58,749
The court proceedings
against Sunny start tomorrow.

836
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,874
Your case is very strong like that.

837
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:03,374
Because the tissues found on
the nails of the dead body...

838
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:06,540
...belong to Sunny.

839
01:25:06,541 --> 01:25:09,208
Why are you telling all this to me?

840
01:25:09,209 --> 01:25:13,874
Because there is only
one weak link in this case.

841
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:16,874
You.
- Me?

842
01:25:16,875 --> 01:25:20,875
Yes. Because it was through
you that the body was found.

843
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:24,415
And the way in which it was found...

844
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:28,209
...the lawyer will blast
you to smithereens for that.

845
01:25:29,334 --> 01:25:32,749
You will be turned into a joke.

846
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:33,916
And...

847
01:25:33,917 --> 01:25:35,665
I have heard that there was some...

848
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:38,958
...problem between you and Sunny?

849
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:41,832
He has threatened to kill my child.

850
01:25:41,833 --> 01:25:46,832
And you had threatened
to send him to jail.

851
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:48,374
Yes.

852
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:50,374
Sunny is a handsome man,
Drishti and...

853
01:25:50,375 --> 01:25:53,457
...his womanly
affairs are very famous.

854
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:56,374
Did you and he have... something...

855
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:59,457
Even if I and Sunny
had something like this...

856
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:03,374
...why would I tell you about it?

857
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:07,833
Well, do you know anything
else about Sunny or the victim?

858
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:10,707
No.

859
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:16,916
We will meet in the
court tomorrow then.

860
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:26,625
By the way, Mr. Gupta.
The victim had a name too.

861
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:39,333
Your Honor, my next
witness is Mr. Joe Alvaris.

862
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:43,332
Proceed.

863
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:46,874
Mr. Alvaris, since when are
you working in the Queen club?

864
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:48,916
Since four years.

865
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:52,291
Were you on duty on the
night of 4th October? - Yes.

866
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:56,874
Did the accused come
there that night? - Yes.

867
01:26:56,875 --> 01:27:00,874
Can you tell us what
you saw there that night?

868
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:03,707
A customer was drunk that day.

869
01:27:03,708 --> 01:27:06,832
I was taking him
from inside to outside...

870
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:10,749
...when a girl came
to him very angrily.

871
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:13,415
And the accused was with him.

872
01:27:13,416 --> 01:27:16,707
He stopped the girl
by the parking lot.

873
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:18,958
Both of them were arguing a lot.

874
01:27:18,959 --> 01:27:22,374
The girl scratched the
hand of the accused.

875
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:24,624
And the accused slapped her sharply.

876
01:27:24,625 --> 01:27:25,916
She fell down.

877
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:29,375
He made her sit in the car and left.

878
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:33,916
Can you tell the court
the time of this incident?

879
01:27:33,917 --> 01:27:36,457
Around 11 or 1130.

880
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:39,457
Is this the same girl?
- Yes.

881
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:41,457
Your honor, please note that tha...

882
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:46,916
...witness was shown
the photo of Ms. Natasha.

883
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:56,499
Do you wish to say
anything in your defense?

884
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:01,375
Yes. I was in Queens club
with Natasha that night.

885
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:03,916
It was imperative for me
to go home that night.

886
01:28:03,917 --> 01:28:08,499
Because my wife was not keeping well.

887
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,083
Natasha was angry because of that.

888
01:28:11,084 --> 01:28:12,499
Just leave me alone.

889
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,999
Please, listen to me.
Please listen to me.

890
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,832
Why should I listen to you?
Why should I listen?

891
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,499
Till the time your
hunger was not satiated...

892
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,499
...you used to follow
me here and there.

893
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,832
Did you not remember your wife then?

894
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:27,375
You men are such dogs. You
love a new woman everyday.

895
01:28:27,542 --> 01:28:29,541
Okay. I will not go home.

896
01:28:29,542 --> 01:28:30,916
Come on, we will go inside.
- No Sunny.

897
01:28:30,917 --> 01:28:36,042
Stop it.
- Come on, come on.

898
01:28:40,792 --> 01:28:46,750
Bitch! I am telling you repeatedly.
I will not go home.

899
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:54,541
It was just an accident, My Lord.

900
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:58,416
After that, I left for
the hospital with Natasha.

901
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,541
Natasha, are you all right?

902
01:29:13,542 --> 01:29:15,083
Sunny, stop the car.

903
01:29:15,084 --> 01:29:16,541
I am sorry, Natasha.

904
01:29:16,542 --> 01:29:22,292
Stop the car, I have to get down.

905
01:29:25,084 --> 01:29:28,833
What is the problem,
darling? I will drop you home.

906
01:29:28,834 --> 01:29:30,624
Let go of my hand.

907
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:33,667
Let go of my hand.
Or else I will shout.

908
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:45,041
Go, Sunny.

909
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:47,041
Natasha, please. Come on.

910
01:29:47,042 --> 01:29:52,124
Just get the hell out of here. Go.

911
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:57,666
Okay! Go to hell!

912
01:30:02,042 --> 01:30:07,833
My lord, that was the
last time I saw Natasha.

913
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:17,624
You just said that
you were interested...

914
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:20,917
...in the pond of the accused,
all of a sudden.

915
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,041
Interested. How?

916
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:25,791
Mayor, Rahul and me.

917
01:30:25,792 --> 01:30:28,624
We had gone to meet this woman.

918
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:30,165
Who helped us

919
01:30:30,166 --> 01:30:33,917
Why did you think that Drishti...

920
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:36,958
...could help you?

921
01:30:36,959 --> 01:30:40,500
Everyone in the city
say that Drishti is a...

922
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:43,124
...what do you call it... that...

923
01:30:43,125 --> 01:30:44,332
An astrologer?

924
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:47,666
You can call her an astrologer.

925
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:49,249
So she saw the horoscope and...

926
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:51,041
She does not read the horoscope.

927
01:30:51,042 --> 01:30:53,666
She reads cards.
- Is it so?

928
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:56,666
And what did she see in the cards?

929
01:30:56,667 --> 01:30:59,709
Actually, she did not see
anything in it that day.

930
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:02,666
She came to me the next day and...

931
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:06,916
...told me that she has seen a dream.

932
01:31:06,917 --> 01:31:08,666
Interesting!

933
01:31:08,667 --> 01:31:11,165
A dream.
- Yes?

934
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:15,666
As in a dream?
- Yes.

935
01:31:15,667 --> 01:31:19,708
And what... what did
she see in the dream?

936
01:31:19,709 --> 01:31:24,625
She saw a lake there.
A chain on a tree.

937
01:31:25,709 --> 01:31:29,583
A bloodied dead body.
She awoke scared.

938
01:31:29,959 --> 01:31:32,040
Then? Then?

939
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:34,040
Then she came out of the house...

940
01:31:34,041 --> 01:31:36,207
...to give milk to
the dog and suddenly...

941
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:40,708
...she saw a tree and... and...

942
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:43,708
I am listening... I am listening.

943
01:31:43,709 --> 01:31:46,708
She saw the body of
Natasha on the tree.

944
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:50,250
Her clothes were torn. She
was straddled in a chain.

945
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:53,708
And...

946
01:31:53,709 --> 01:31:57,708
And she was swimming on the tree.

947
01:31:57,709 --> 01:32:00,708
Swimming?
- Yes.

948
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:03,834
On the tree?
- Yes.

949
01:32:06,709 --> 01:32:11,249
Just like one swims in water?

950
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,249
Yes.

951
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:17,292
That is strange.
Really this is strange.

952
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:25,375
She was straddled in a chain,
her clothes were torn.

953
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:31,292
Like one swims in water.
But on the tree.

954
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:36,374
Very interesting.

955
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:42,167
No more questions, My lord. I...

956
01:32:50,709 --> 01:32:54,000
Tania, will you pick up
Arjun from the school today?

957
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:56,040
Of course, Drishti.
- Thanks.

958
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:57,874
Friend!

959
01:32:57,875 --> 01:33:02,791
I will leave now.
- Yes.

960
01:33:02,792 --> 01:33:04,374
What are you doing here?

961
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:08,083
Can I speak to you? Just a minute?

962
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,040
Not today, I am worried... please...

963
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:12,291
Friend...

964
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:15,040
You told me to tell my
matters of heart to you.

965
01:33:15,041 --> 01:33:22,292
I think about it a lot.
- What? - That... - What is it, Mohit?

966
01:33:23,709 --> 01:33:28,333
Why do I think nowadays
that I... I... am very sick?

967
01:33:29,041 --> 01:33:34,292
When I think about dad.
- We will speak two days later.

968
01:33:34,417 --> 01:33:36,999
It is very necessary to
speak about it. Today.

969
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,709
A couple of days...

970
01:33:41,834 --> 01:33:44,833
There is something missing in me.

971
01:33:44,834 --> 01:33:47,874
I am a eunuch. A eunuch. I will die.

972
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:49,040
If I kill the buffalo, I will die.

973
01:33:49,041 --> 01:33:51,165
See, I am very worried.

974
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:54,375
We will talk leisurely in two days.

975
01:33:54,834 --> 01:34:01,375
Friend... but friend... it
is very important to speak.

976
01:34:02,834 --> 01:34:08,292
I am alone, friend.

977
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:14,583
What happened, Drishti?

978
01:34:14,792 --> 01:34:18,791
I am very much troubled.

979
01:34:18,792 --> 01:34:22,374
I am not related to this case.

980
01:34:22,375 --> 01:34:25,417
Natasha was killed.

981
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:27,874
Sunny committed the murder.

982
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:33,750
And tomorrow, I have to
give evidence in the court,

983
01:34:33,875 --> 01:34:39,583
I am troubled a lot at times.

984
01:34:42,417 --> 01:34:44,874
Will you take Arjun
to school tomorrow?

985
01:34:44,875 --> 01:34:50,792
Of course.
- Thanks.

986
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:55,874
The phone is ringing.

987
01:34:55,875 --> 01:35:01,375
It will be on the answering machine.

988
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:07,915
Rahul was asking about you
in the school yesterday.

989
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:11,207
I am mother of Mohit. I do not
know what has happened to him.

990
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:14,375
He is beating his father!
Yes! He is hitting him badly!

991
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:27,167
Speak to me!
- I do not want to. It is too late.

992
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:29,915
I had come to speak
to you, is not it?

993
01:35:29,916 --> 01:35:31,915
Do not you remember?

994
01:35:31,916 --> 01:35:35,167
We can speak yet too. It is not late.

995
01:35:36,916 --> 01:35:41,541
Let him go! Listen to me!

996
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:48,500
Should I leave him?
Just like how he left me?

997
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:52,957
Alone?

998
01:35:52,958 --> 01:35:54,957
No!

999
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:59,957
I was six years old.

1000
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:06,000
I had just asked a toy.

1001
01:36:06,875 --> 01:36:10,333
The cane had broken on
the back, due to beatings.

1002
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:13,957
Papa... papa...

1003
01:36:13,958 --> 01:36:17,416
You had kept me naked all
through the night outside the house.

1004
01:36:17,417 --> 01:36:21,207
It was raining too, is not it?
Do not you remember?

1005
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:26,167
Enough! Mohit!
Enough! I beg you! Enough!

1006
01:36:26,333 --> 01:36:29,249
It was raining that day.
- Enough!

1007
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:35,042
A six year old child. He was
trembling at night due to cold.

1008
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:40,042
It was raining so hard!
Do not you remember?

1009
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,999
Stop it.

1010
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,207
Please forgive me,
son. Please forgive me!

1011
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:50,291
Please let me go!

1012
01:36:50,292 --> 01:36:53,332
I should forgive you?

1013
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:56,375
Julie was a nice girl.
Her scooter conked...

1014
01:36:56,542 --> 01:37:00,417
...and she came to the garage.

1015
01:37:03,042 --> 01:37:06,041
For the first time...

1016
01:37:06,042 --> 01:37:09,041
...I thought that I would
not be alone in this world.

1017
01:37:09,042 --> 01:37:11,541
Throughout my life.
She was sitting with me.

1018
01:37:11,542 --> 01:37:13,207
For one hour.

1019
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:15,707
What was the need to tell her father?

1020
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:18,041
That I am a good for nothing?
I am mad?

1021
01:37:18,042 --> 01:37:22,041
What was the need? I am mad!

1022
01:37:22,042 --> 01:37:24,374
Enough, Mohit! What are you doing?

1023
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:28,292
Get aside! I am alone now.

1024
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:31,584
Julie was good,
mother! Julie was good!

1025
01:37:32,042 --> 01:37:35,041
Julie was good!

1026
01:37:35,042 --> 01:37:37,124
Why did you tell her father?

1027
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:40,292
Why did you tell her father?
- No! No! - Leave him!

1028
01:37:40,375 --> 01:37:43,958
Get aside! Get aside!
Why did not you talk to me!

1029
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:48,041
Why did not you talk to me!
You are my friend?

1030
01:37:48,042 --> 01:37:50,041
I am your friend!
Yes, I am your friend.

1031
01:37:50,042 --> 01:37:53,292
I have nobody. I have nobody.

1032
01:37:57,083 --> 01:38:00,082
The bullock will have to go today.

1033
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:03,082
The bullock will have to go today.

1034
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:04,416
No!

1035
01:38:04,417 --> 01:38:08,082
No!

1036
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:11,082
The bullock will have to go today.

1037
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:13,416
Look at the bullock!
The bullock is burning!

1038
01:38:13,417 --> 01:38:15,499
It is shrieking! I will get freedom!

1039
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:21,708
I will get freedom!
The bullock is gone!

1040
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:48,124
Sunny used to hit me everyday.

1041
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:53,042
Therefore, I went to Drishti,
so that she suggests something.

1042
01:38:53,125 --> 01:38:57,124
What did she suggest you?

1043
01:38:57,125 --> 01:39:01,042
She suggested me to leave him.

1044
01:39:01,125 --> 01:39:04,707
And you did not
accept her suggestion?

1045
01:39:04,708 --> 01:39:10,542
I was scared whether Sunny kills me.
- Then?

1046
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:15,166
Drishti told me that according to...

1047
01:39:15,167 --> 01:39:18,459
...the visions Sunny
cannot kill anyone.

1048
01:39:20,167 --> 01:39:23,582
That is all, your honor.
Your witness.

1049
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:28,582
No questions, your Honor.

1050
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:31,166
Your husband Jai...

1051
01:39:31,167 --> 01:39:34,708
He was killed in an accident
one and half years ago. - Yes.

1052
01:39:35,167 --> 01:39:38,209
How do you and your son survive?

1053
01:39:40,459 --> 01:39:44,167
We get some money every
month from the insurance of Jai.

1054
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:47,208
And I earn something too.

1055
01:39:47,209 --> 01:39:50,124
How?

1056
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:54,083
People come to me.
- Yes. - To know the future.

1057
01:39:54,292 --> 01:39:57,208
Psychic readings!
- Yes.

1058
01:39:57,209 --> 01:40:00,208
So you wish to say that whatever...

1059
01:40:00,209 --> 01:40:03,208
...happened to Natasha, you knew...

1060
01:40:03,209 --> 01:40:06,417
...this not from anything else,
but this power? - Yes.

1061
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:12,917
Thank you. No further questions.
Your witness, please.

1062
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:17,625
Drishti. You have such proper name.

1063
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:23,416
Drishti which means vision.

1064
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:24,540
Tell me something.

1065
01:40:24,541 --> 01:40:26,665
How many fingers lie behind my back?

1066
01:40:26,666 --> 01:40:28,208
Objection, your Honor!
- Your Honor...

1067
01:40:28,209 --> 01:40:30,291
...my client has been
accused of murder...

1068
01:40:30,292 --> 01:40:32,374
...due to the so called
powers of this woman.

1069
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:34,832
Do I have no right
to test her talents?

1070
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:38,125
Should we think her witness
to be the line on the stone?

1071
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:51,374
How many fingers are
there behind my back?

1072
01:40:51,375 --> 01:40:54,249
I do not know.

1073
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,416
Seven.

1074
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:59,249
See, it is such a simple answer.

1075
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:02,500
Are you a very rich woman?

1076
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:04,582
No.

1077
01:41:04,583 --> 01:41:05,874
Why?

1078
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:09,334
If I had these psychic powers,
I would be very rich.

1079
01:41:09,417 --> 01:41:11,499
I would buy shares at good prices.

1080
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:17,333
I would put money on
the horses in the derby.

1081
01:41:17,708 --> 01:41:20,415
And the most important thing is...

1082
01:41:20,416 --> 01:41:23,708
Your husband would
not die in an accident.

1083
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:28,167
I cannot use my powers for
my gains whenever I wish.

1084
01:41:29,292 --> 01:41:31,624
Is it so?

1085
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:35,583
So you use your
powers only to earn money?

1086
01:41:35,708 --> 01:41:37,874
I do not ask money from anybody.

1087
01:41:37,875 --> 01:41:40,874
People give that to me themselves.

1088
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:44,291
No offense meant. I am sorry.

1089
01:41:44,292 --> 01:41:47,708
Were you angry with Sunny?
- Yes.

1090
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:50,333
You told Sunny a few days earlier...

1091
01:41:50,334 --> 01:41:53,791
...that you would
make him rot in prison.

1092
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,333
Did you say that?

1093
01:41:55,334 --> 01:41:57,874
He had threatened my son and me.

1094
01:41:57,875 --> 01:41:59,333
Okay.

1095
01:41:59,334 --> 01:42:02,541
So you had a reason to trap Sunny.

1096
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:05,874
Do you think that I put the
body of Natasha in the lake?

1097
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:10,249
Did I say anything like that?

1098
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:11,499
Anyway.

1099
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,833
A while ago, Riya said
that you had told her that...

1100
01:42:14,917 --> 01:42:18,875
...Sunny can never ever kill anybody.

1101
01:42:19,334 --> 01:42:21,333
Maybe, Riya was lying.

1102
01:42:21,334 --> 01:42:24,333
No. I had told her this.

1103
01:42:24,334 --> 01:42:28,292
Then, how can you say today,
that Sunny killed Natasha?

1104
01:42:28,416 --> 01:42:29,957
I never said anything like that.

1105
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:35,374
I just told the police what I saw.

1106
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:38,374
Oh yes. How can I forget that?

1107
01:42:38,375 --> 01:42:40,374
What was that?

1108
01:42:40,375 --> 01:42:42,415
Body of Natasha in
a chain, bloodied...

1109
01:42:42,416 --> 01:42:48,583
...and swimming... on the tree.

1110
01:42:48,792 --> 01:42:54,374
As if it is swimming in water.

1111
01:42:54,375 --> 01:42:57,540
You must be enjoying all
these fantasies, is not it?

1112
01:42:57,541 --> 01:43:01,292
If you think that I get
entertained seeing all this...

1113
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:06,292
...I would wish that even you
see rotten bodies on trees.

1114
01:43:06,375 --> 01:43:08,707
Someone should strangle
you while sleeping too.

1115
01:43:08,708 --> 01:43:11,374
I am cursing myself
that I could not...

1116
01:43:11,375 --> 01:43:14,041
...stop a son from
killing his father...

1117
01:43:14,042 --> 01:43:16,999
And you think that I am enjoying it?

1118
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,625
If this is what you think, I am
sorry to say you are totally crazy.

1119
01:43:25,375 --> 01:43:30,791
No more questions.

1120
01:43:35,708 --> 01:43:38,582
Is this true that you
hit your wife everyday?

1121
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:41,667
Yes. This is not hidden from anyone.

1122
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:44,415
Okay. So you accept that you have...

1123
01:43:44,416 --> 01:43:48,540
...a violent attitude towards women.

1124
01:43:48,541 --> 01:43:51,415
Did you hit Natasha on the
night that she was killed?

1125
01:43:51,416 --> 01:43:55,333
I did not hit her. I just
slapped her. - Oh, I am sorry.

1126
01:43:56,625 --> 01:43:59,833
Can you tell the court what
extent of violence is called hitting?

1127
01:44:02,917 --> 01:44:05,415
Looking at your anger, I am
happy that I am not a woman.

1128
01:44:05,416 --> 01:44:06,999
Anyway...

1129
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,540
So you and Natasha had an affair.

1130
01:44:10,541 --> 01:44:13,457
Beautiful, educated, the girl...

1131
01:44:13,458 --> 01:44:17,708
...from the most renowned family
of this city, who was about to...

1132
01:44:17,792 --> 01:44:21,084
...be married to a good man.
What did she see in you?

1133
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,416
Send someone to me.
You will find out.

1134
01:44:28,458 --> 01:44:31,041
You are a rotten wretch.

1135
01:44:31,042 --> 01:44:34,124
Objection, My Lord.
- Objection sustained.

1136
01:44:34,125 --> 01:44:38,499
No personal comments.
- Sorry, Your Honor.

1137
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:40,540
Is this a coincidence that the day...

1138
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:42,624
...that you hit Natasha,
someone killed her...

1139
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:44,832
...and put her body in your lake?

1140
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:47,499
I do not think this
to be a coincidence.

1141
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:50,499
So?

1142
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:53,749
I am being trapped in this case.

1143
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:56,499
Oh I see.

1144
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:59,499
Do you see any
difference in Natasha and a cat?

1145
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:00,666
What do you mean?

1146
01:45:00,667 --> 01:45:03,917
Did not you say that the
scratch on your hand was of a cat?

1147
01:45:04,042 --> 01:45:05,166
I had.

1148
01:45:05,167 --> 01:45:06,499
And you said in the court
that Natasha scratched you.

1149
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:09,041
I lied to the police because my
wife was with me at that time.

1150
01:45:09,042 --> 01:45:11,041
And how can I accept that
you are telling the truth now?

1151
01:45:11,042 --> 01:45:12,207
Because I am not lying. God damn it!

1152
01:45:12,208 --> 01:45:13,541
I am not lying.

1153
01:45:13,542 --> 01:45:15,541
This woman is
intent on destroying me.

1154
01:45:15,542 --> 01:45:17,041
Silence please! - I will not
be silent. I will not be silent.

1155
01:45:17,042 --> 01:45:18,207
Because I am innocent.

1156
01:45:18,208 --> 01:45:20,207
I accept that I am
not a good husband.

1157
01:45:20,208 --> 01:45:21,707
But I did not kill Natasha.
I did not kill her.

1158
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:23,874
This witch is trapping me.

1159
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:26,541
She does black magic on
all the people of the city.

1160
01:45:26,542 --> 01:45:28,582
You will burn into ashes
one day. You rot in hell!

1161
01:45:28,583 --> 01:45:30,749
I will not spare you!
I will not spare you!

1162
01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:32,207
Take him away! Take him away!

1163
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:35,541
Let me go, your honor. I
am innocent, your honor!

1164
01:45:35,542 --> 01:45:36,874
You bloody bitch!

1165
01:45:36,875 --> 01:45:39,917
I will not spare you.
You have ruined my life!

1166
01:45:41,042 --> 01:45:43,541
In the murder case of
Natasha daughter of the mayor...

1167
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:45,791
...of our city mayor Raj
Bahadur was completed today.

1168
01:45:45,792 --> 01:45:49,750
Sunil Tehan, also known as Sunny...

1169
01:45:49,875 --> 01:45:52,165
...was sentenced to
life imprisonment today.

1170
01:45:52,166 --> 01:45:55,583
Today the Prime
minister of our country...

1171
01:45:57,667 --> 01:46:02,292
Thank God!

1172
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:31,707
Sit down now.

1173
01:46:31,708 --> 01:46:34,834
As it is you are very
worried about this case.

1174
01:46:52,042 --> 01:46:58,375
Thank you.
- It is Ok.

1175
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:06,624
I will keep the cups.

1176
01:47:06,625 --> 01:47:12,083
Wait. Drishti.

1177
01:47:15,083 --> 01:47:18,124
Not only is Raj Bahadur
Singh a friend of my father.

1178
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:19,707
He is my mentor too.

1179
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:22,624
When he came with
the marriage proposal...

1180
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:25,624
...I could not refuse him.
I knew that we...

1181
01:47:25,625 --> 01:47:30,666
...both were not right for each other.

1182
01:47:30,667 --> 01:47:36,041
Maybe, if Natasha would
find her true love, maybe...

1183
01:47:36,667 --> 01:47:39,666
This was fated to happen.

1184
01:47:39,667 --> 01:47:42,666
Life is so strange.

1185
01:47:42,667 --> 01:47:46,875
I did not love Natasha.
Yet, I agreed to marry her.

1186
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,542
And whom I do love,
I cannot tell her.

1187
01:47:52,917 --> 01:47:57,708
I have seen a lot of dreams in life.

1188
01:47:57,709 --> 01:48:01,708
I am scared of this dream.

1189
01:48:01,709 --> 01:48:04,958
I know that it is
not easy to forget Jai.

1190
01:48:04,959 --> 01:48:10,125
But we cannot run from
truth of life. - I am scared.

1191
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:21,417
I will wait.

1192
01:49:04,709 --> 01:49:06,708
I know that if you wish not to see...

1193
01:49:06,709 --> 01:49:09,874
...face of anyone all
through your life, it will be me.

1194
01:49:09,875 --> 01:49:15,250
If you try to kick me out
from here, I will not blame you.

1195
01:49:16,083 --> 01:49:22,250
But I need you badly.

1196
01:49:25,709 --> 01:49:31,750
Riya... come inside.

1197
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:35,333
I am scared. This fear
will make me go crazy.

1198
01:49:37,792 --> 01:49:40,207
Nothing will happen to you.

1199
01:49:40,208 --> 01:49:44,667
Can you see this in the cards?
- Yes.

1200
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:52,083
And the thoughts in mind,
can you see them too?

1201
01:49:52,792 --> 01:49:58,249
What do you wish to say?

1202
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:04,667
I get very bad thoughts.
I hate myself.

1203
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:06,332
What do you mean?

1204
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:09,833
I feel happy that Natasha is dead.

1205
01:50:09,834 --> 01:50:14,750
Ever since she came in life
of Sunny, I wished her death.

1206
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:20,375
I never told you this.
But I followed Sunny once.

1207
01:50:21,041 --> 01:50:26,333
Six months ago, when Raj
Bahadur had gone out of town.

1208
01:50:26,834 --> 01:50:30,375
I saw him go out of the
house of Natasha, that day.

1209
01:50:31,916 --> 01:50:36,082
I will call you later.
- Ok.

1210
01:50:36,083 --> 01:50:41,708
Love you.
- Love you. Bye.

1211
01:50:57,458 --> 01:51:02,250
You.

1212
01:51:02,958 --> 01:51:06,374
Did Sunny come here?

1213
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:08,374
Why would Sunny come here?

1214
01:51:08,375 --> 01:51:11,916
Why are you lying? I
saw him going from here!

1215
01:51:15,875 --> 01:51:20,332
Why do you ask me then?

1216
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:25,250
You bitch!

1217
01:51:33,417 --> 01:51:35,207
I do not know what
would have happened...

1218
01:51:35,208 --> 01:51:41,042
...if Raj Bahadur did not
come there at that time.

1219
01:51:43,417 --> 01:51:45,874
What happened, Drishti?

1220
01:51:45,875 --> 01:51:50,125
Nothing. You go from here. I
cannot read anything more.

1221
01:51:50,208 --> 01:51:53,040
But, my fear...
- Everything will be all right.

1222
01:51:53,041 --> 01:51:56,292
Go from here. Please, leave me alone.

1223
01:51:56,542 --> 01:52:01,500
Drishti...
- Go away from here!

1224
01:53:32,292 --> 01:53:38,375
The killer is still free...

1225
01:53:44,042 --> 01:53:47,041
What happened?

1226
01:53:47,042 --> 01:53:51,250
Sunny did not kill Natasha.
- What?

1227
01:53:52,042 --> 01:53:57,584
Yes. I know.
- Oh my God!

1228
01:54:04,334 --> 01:54:08,333
The filled wounds
are freshened again.

1229
01:54:08,334 --> 01:54:10,333
I am very sorry, Rahul.

1230
01:54:10,334 --> 01:54:12,124
But...

1231
01:54:12,125 --> 01:54:16,041
Who is the murderer of Natasha?

1232
01:54:16,042 --> 01:54:20,166
I cannot see that, Rahul.

1233
01:54:20,167 --> 01:54:21,458
Come with me.
- Where?

1234
01:54:21,459 --> 01:54:24,041
We will tell the police
that Sunny is innocent.

1235
01:54:24,042 --> 01:54:26,041
No, Rahul!
- But why?

1236
01:54:26,042 --> 01:54:28,374
Because I do not
know who the killer is.

1237
01:54:28,375 --> 01:54:34,042
I will be made into
a joke once again.

1238
01:56:09,417 --> 01:56:12,541
Drishti, it is you?

1239
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:16,416
There something I
want to talk to you.

1240
01:56:16,417 --> 01:56:19,374
Please come in.

1241
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:25,291
Like to have a drink?
- No.

1242
01:56:31,209 --> 01:56:33,208
I am listening.

1243
01:56:33,209 --> 01:56:35,458
Sunny is not the killer of Natasha.

1244
01:56:35,459 --> 01:56:38,917
What? Are you insane? It
was an open and shut case.

1245
01:56:40,209 --> 01:56:45,083
The killer is still roaming free.
- How can you be so sure?

1246
01:56:45,459 --> 01:56:48,208
Just like I saw the
dead body of Natasha...

1247
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:52,083
...I can say that Sunny
did not kill Natasha?

1248
01:56:52,334 --> 01:56:58,292
Do you know who the killer is?
- No.

1249
01:56:59,334 --> 01:57:01,624
Well, that would not have
made a difference though.

1250
01:57:01,625 --> 01:57:05,292
That Sunny is a barbarian.
Let him rot in jail.

1251
01:57:06,209 --> 01:57:09,499
Today I received a warning.

1252
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:12,625
Someone will try to kill me.

1253
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:16,208
What do you expect me to do?

1254
01:57:16,209 --> 01:57:19,665
Reopen the case.

1255
01:57:19,666 --> 01:57:23,125
I cannot do that. The
court has declared him guilty.

1256
01:57:23,209 --> 01:57:26,540
The case must be reopened.

1257
01:57:26,541 --> 01:57:30,374
You consider me a fool
enough to heed your words?

1258
01:57:30,375 --> 01:57:33,249
All right. Then I will
tell everyone that Natasha...

1259
01:57:33,250 --> 01:57:36,249
...and you had a relationship.

1260
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:37,582
I had seen both of you together...

1261
01:57:37,583 --> 01:57:39,374
...at the party in the other night.

1262
01:57:39,375 --> 01:57:44,249
How much money do you want?

1263
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:47,416
Reopen the case.

1264
01:57:47,417 --> 01:57:51,334
I feared that this would happen.
And now it will.

1265
01:57:51,417 --> 01:57:52,582
What do you mean?

1266
01:57:52,583 --> 01:57:56,167
Natasha had come here a
day before her murder...

1267
01:57:56,250 --> 01:58:01,208
...and I was at home.

1268
01:58:37,416 --> 01:58:42,333
Abhi.
- Yes darling?

1269
01:58:42,334 --> 01:58:45,416
Marry me.
- And what about Rahul?

1270
01:58:46,583 --> 01:58:48,665
I will ditch him.

1271
01:58:48,666 --> 01:58:51,333
We will not find a
better opportunity...

1272
01:58:51,334 --> 01:58:53,749
...to defame mayor Raj Bahadur Singh.

1273
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:55,333
Are you nuts, darling?

1274
01:58:55,334 --> 01:58:58,582
I will lose my job.

1275
01:58:58,583 --> 01:59:01,749
My career will be ruined!

1276
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:04,875
You bastard!
- Come on, Natasha.

1277
01:59:06,541 --> 01:59:10,917
Shucks! Abhi, you are so despicable!

1278
01:59:11,625 --> 01:59:17,583
Today you are a public
prosecutor because of me.

1279
01:59:17,708 --> 01:59:21,583
I know darling, but...
- Do not touch me.

1280
01:59:25,375 --> 01:59:31,750
I will expose you.

1281
01:59:36,625 --> 01:59:40,250
I fear that this
secret may get exposed...

1282
01:59:40,375 --> 01:59:43,792
...if the case reopens.

1283
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:49,292
I beg of you, Drishti.
Let sleeping dogs lie.

1284
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:54,666
It would be better for all of us.

1285
01:59:54,667 --> 01:59:57,707
Drishti, surprised to see you here.

1286
01:59:57,708 --> 02:00:02,374
You had said that
you were going home?

1287
02:00:02,375 --> 02:00:08,875
Abhigyan is reopening the case.

1288
02:00:10,416 --> 02:00:12,499
Rahul, it was very
important to meet Abhigyan.

1289
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:14,624
But you should not have
taken such a big risk.

1290
02:00:14,625 --> 02:00:17,707
I know that this was my foolishness.

1291
02:00:17,708 --> 02:00:22,415
I am really sorry.
- It is okay.

1292
02:00:22,416 --> 02:00:24,624
Drishti, what are you thinking?

1293
02:00:24,625 --> 02:00:27,707
Rahul, can Abhigyan kill Natasha?

1294
02:00:27,708 --> 02:00:30,833
I do not think so. I
know Abhi very well.

1295
02:00:33,416 --> 02:00:37,874
Drishti, what happened?

1296
02:00:37,875 --> 02:00:40,415
I am confused.

1297
02:00:40,416 --> 02:00:42,041
I will drop you to your residence.

1298
02:00:42,042 --> 02:00:45,624
No, I will manage.
- All right.

1299
02:00:45,625 --> 02:00:51,542
Call me after reaching home.
- All right.

1300
02:03:39,208 --> 02:03:42,542
Hello. - Tanya... - Drishti,
where the hell are you?

1301
02:03:42,625 --> 02:03:46,624
My fingers have ached
dialing your number.

1302
02:03:46,625 --> 02:03:48,791
He has just gone to sleep.
Shall I wake him?

1303
02:03:48,792 --> 02:03:52,250
No. May I sleep at your home? Please.

1304
02:03:52,625 --> 02:03:56,749
Obviously, there is no need to ask.

1305
02:03:56,750 --> 02:04:02,708
I will tell you after I come there.

1306
02:04:36,250 --> 02:04:37,833
I was scared.

1307
02:04:37,834 --> 02:04:39,791
I was more scared than you were.

1308
02:04:39,792 --> 02:04:41,833
Why did not you call
me after reaching home?

1309
02:04:41,834 --> 02:04:44,708
Rahul, I am going crazy.
I am going crazy!

1310
02:04:44,709 --> 02:04:46,082
Come on, let me take you inside.

1311
02:04:46,083 --> 02:04:48,207
No. Rahul, we will go there.

1312
02:04:48,208 --> 02:04:52,083
Where? - Where the
corpse of Natasha was found.

1313
02:04:52,208 --> 02:04:54,708
Near the lake.
- Right away?

1314
02:04:54,709 --> 02:04:57,791
Yes, Rahul. These
visions will drive me crazy.

1315
02:04:57,792 --> 02:05:01,625
Please.
- Fine, let us go.

1316
02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:08,957
Did you see something?

1317
02:06:08,958 --> 02:06:13,666
No.

1318
02:07:39,875 --> 02:07:44,124
What happened? Did you see something?

1319
02:07:44,125 --> 02:07:46,124
No.

1320
02:07:46,125 --> 02:07:48,957
No.

1321
02:07:48,958 --> 02:07:54,416
Let us go home.

1322
02:08:04,875 --> 02:08:07,999
I know that you know it.

1323
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,958
I... I do not know anything.

1324
02:08:18,833 --> 02:08:21,874
Elections are
scheduled after three months.

1325
02:08:21,875 --> 02:08:24,958
I want to win this
election at any cost.

1326
02:08:26,875 --> 02:08:32,208
My father could have
won many more times.

1327
02:08:32,333 --> 02:08:36,040
But Raj Bahadur
Singh deceived my father!

1328
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:37,915
That bastard!

1329
02:08:37,916 --> 02:08:41,000
That year my father was
certainly going to be the mayor.

1330
02:08:41,083 --> 02:08:44,833
But Raj Bahadur Singh
charged him of corruption...

1331
02:08:44,916 --> 02:08:49,915
...and he became the mayor instead.

1332
02:08:49,916 --> 02:08:51,915
And after becoming the mayor...

1333
02:08:51,916 --> 02:08:54,999
...he came to seek
blessings from my father.

1334
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,374
That dog!

1335
02:08:57,375 --> 02:08:59,416
That day I decided.

1336
02:08:59,417 --> 02:09:05,167
I would become the
mayor and expose him.

1337
02:09:06,041 --> 02:09:10,875
Everything was going on as I planned.

1338
02:09:11,208 --> 02:09:13,957
But Natasha...

1339
02:09:13,958 --> 02:09:16,957
Her activities were
getting more notorious...

1340
02:09:16,958 --> 02:09:19,040
...as days passed. Her affairs.
Her lifestyles...

1341
02:09:19,041 --> 02:09:22,167
She was maligning the party.

1342
02:09:23,958 --> 02:09:27,167
Anyway, I wanted an excuse
to reject this proposal.

1343
02:09:27,958 --> 02:09:31,875
That day I was waiting for
Natasha outside Queens club.

1344
02:09:33,041 --> 02:09:35,957
I saw her quarrelling with Sunny.

1345
02:09:35,958 --> 02:09:38,040
I followed them
from the very moment...

1346
02:09:38,041 --> 02:09:41,082
...they got in the car and left.

1347
02:09:41,083 --> 02:09:45,042
Natasha got down in
midway and started walking.

1348
02:09:55,208 --> 02:09:59,875
Hey Natasha, why are
walking here so late at night?

1349
02:10:00,459 --> 02:10:02,999
My car broke down.

1350
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,583
Get in. I will drop you home.

1351
02:10:04,584 --> 02:10:10,583
Come.
- Yes.

1352
02:10:17,042 --> 02:10:20,041
I brought Natasha
home thinking that...

1353
02:10:20,042 --> 02:10:24,000
...I would make everything
clear and snap all our ties.

1354
02:10:24,083 --> 02:10:28,584
But that shameless woman
was playing love with me.

1355
02:10:28,708 --> 02:10:32,417
She was behaving as if
nothing had happened.

1356
02:11:12,584 --> 02:11:20,666
'O beloved, your love makes
this land a heaven for me.'

1357
02:11:35,083 --> 02:11:43,000
'O beloved, your love has
brought freshness in my life.'

1358
02:11:43,375 --> 02:11:48,000
'Make me yours.'

1359
02:11:48,083 --> 02:11:52,375
'Adorn my dreams with your love.'

1360
02:11:52,542 --> 02:12:02,167
'This silence asks you
to take me in your arms.'

1361
02:12:37,417 --> 02:12:46,541
'This breeze wants us to get closer.'

1362
02:12:46,666 --> 02:12:54,209
'Yes, I've made this mistake.
Give me any sentence.'

1363
02:12:54,334 --> 02:12:59,042
'What should I do
and what should I not? '

1364
02:12:59,209 --> 02:13:04,083
'O lover, why should I
let out these sighs? '

1365
02:13:04,209 --> 02:13:08,583
'O lover, makes these
moments pleasant for me.'

1366
02:13:08,708 --> 02:13:13,083
'Take my life.'

1367
02:13:13,209 --> 02:13:22,083
'O beloved, your love makes
this land a heaven for me.'

1368
02:13:22,209 --> 02:13:30,625
'O beloved, your love has
brought freshness in my life.'

1369
02:13:30,708 --> 02:13:35,250
'Make me yours.'

1370
02:13:35,375 --> 02:13:39,334
'Adorn my dreams with your love.'

1371
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:47,125
'This silence asks you
to take me in your arms.'

1372
02:13:47,209 --> 02:13:51,959
'This breeze wants us to get closer.'

1373
02:14:23,541 --> 02:14:28,707
You did the same with Sunny, right?

1374
02:14:28,708 --> 02:14:32,500
With Abhigyan. With Paul.

1375
02:14:32,708 --> 02:14:35,374
And how many more names
should I take, you bitch!

1376
02:14:35,375 --> 02:14:40,667
You bastard!

1377
02:15:05,292 --> 02:15:10,209
Sunny got the sentence. I
thought my life is at peace.

1378
02:15:11,416 --> 02:15:15,999
I would become the
mayor and marry you.

1379
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,415
But...

1380
02:15:19,416 --> 02:15:24,792
But I am sorry, Drishti.

1381
02:15:28,416 --> 02:15:33,209
I... I... will not tell this to anyone.

1382
02:15:34,334 --> 02:15:36,874
I am telling the truth.

1383
02:15:36,875 --> 02:15:39,540
No... no.

1384
02:15:39,541 --> 02:15:43,708
Really... really... I will
not tell this to anyone.

1385
02:15:43,917 --> 02:15:46,540
Really?
- Yes.

1386
02:15:46,541 --> 02:15:51,709
I love you, Drishti.

1387
02:16:07,792 --> 02:16:14,250
I love you, Drishti. But I am sorry.

1388
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:34,292
I do not want to kill you.
But Drishti, I am helpless.

1389
02:16:35,333 --> 02:16:40,125
I cannot take any chance.

1390
02:16:40,375 --> 02:16:46,459
Drishti, go away from here.

1391
02:16:51,667 --> 02:16:56,500
No!

1392
02:16:59,541 --> 02:17:04,875
No!

1393
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:18,500
No!

1394
02:17:33,375 --> 02:17:39,041
No!

1395
02:18:04,583 --> 02:18:10,375
Friend, are you all right?

1396
02:18:51,542 --> 02:18:54,624
Mohit, you were supposed
to be in hospital, right?

1397
02:18:54,625 --> 02:18:58,416
Friend, I ran away
from there. I am free now.

1398
02:18:58,792 --> 02:19:02,667
I am sorry, Mohit. I
could not help you.

1399
02:19:02,834 --> 02:19:04,541
Friend, do not say such words.

1400
02:19:04,542 --> 02:19:07,792
You are my only friend.

1401
02:19:13,667 --> 02:19:18,749
Friend...

1402
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:21,959
...I have washed this. It is yours.

1403
02:19:38,542 --> 02:19:40,999
Will you accompany me
to the police station?

1404
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,541
Yes. Of course.

1405
02:19:43,542 --> 02:19:49,000
Shall we go?

1406
02:20:01,583 --> 02:20:04,667
Mohit, you must go
back to the hospital.

1407
02:20:04,750 --> 02:20:11,000
Friend, I will certainly go back.

1408
02:20:38,625 --> 02:20:41,874
What happened?

1409
02:20:41,875 --> 02:20:44,332
Rahul has confessed his crime.

1410
02:20:44,333 --> 02:20:47,916
I have known him for years.

1411
02:20:47,917 --> 02:20:53,208
Strange! We assume that we
know a person very well.

1412
02:20:54,667 --> 02:20:58,583
And sometimes we do not
know anything about him.

1413
02:21:00,083 --> 02:21:05,542
Is Rahul okay?
- You hit him quite hard.

1414
02:21:05,667 --> 02:21:09,208
I did not. Mohit hit him.
- Mohit hit him?

1415
02:21:09,875 --> 02:21:12,874
You are kidding.
- Ask Rahul.

1416
02:21:12,875 --> 02:21:14,999
Rahul does not remember anything.

1417
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:18,625
Believe me.
- How can I believe you?

1418
02:21:19,709 --> 02:21:22,332
How could I ever put
Rahul in the car, all alone?

1419
02:21:22,333 --> 02:21:24,374
Mohit cannot be there, Drishti.

1420
02:21:24,375 --> 02:21:26,290
I got a call from
hospital just this evening.

1421
02:21:26,291 --> 02:21:30,000
Yes, he told me. He had
run away from the hospital.

1422
02:21:30,291 --> 02:21:34,958
Drishti, Mohit is dead.

1423
02:21:34,959 --> 02:21:36,874
Today afternoon at 3 pm,
he committed suicide...

1424
02:21:36,875 --> 02:21:38,708
...by hanging himself on the fan.

1425
02:21:38,709 --> 02:21:42,750
This is not possible.
Mohit is outside in the car.

1426
02:22:17,166 --> 02:22:19,708
Drishti.
- Yes, mother.

1427
02:22:19,709 --> 02:22:26,125
Just look... who has come.
- Who is it?

1428
02:23:35,834 --> 02:23:41,208
'This is the truth. You are my love.'

1429
02:23:41,375 --> 02:23:47,208
'You are my desire.
You are my relief.'

1430
02:23:59,083 --> 02:24:04,709
'You are the one who showers
me with the light of love.'

1431
02:24:04,834 --> 02:24:09,792
'My happiness is only you.'

1432
02:24:09,916 --> 02:24:16,000
'This is the truth. You are my love.'

1433
02:24:16,083 --> 02:24:23,833
'You are my desire.
You are my relief.'

1434
02:24:58,167 --> 02:25:04,791
'Love is Godliness, O beloved.
I love you.'

1435
02:25:15,208 --> 02:25:21,000
'I am crazy to get your love.
Do give me your love.'

1436
02:25:21,125 --> 02:25:28,208
'My desire is to...

1437
02:25:29,667 --> 02:25:34,833
'My desire is to see
you always before me.'

1438
02:25:34,916 --> 02:25:36,915
'This is the truth.'

1439
02:25:36,916 --> 02:25:42,875
'This is the truth. You are my love.'

1440
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:48,875
'You are my desire.
You are my relief.'

1441
02:25:49,041 --> 02:25:54,375
'This is the truth. You are my love.'

1442
02:25:54,459 --> 02:25:59,875
'You are my desire.
You are my relief.'

1443
02:26:00,958 --> 02:26:06,250
'You are the one who showers
me with the light of love.'

1444
02:26:06,375 --> 02:26:11,333
'My happiness is only you.'

1445
02:26:11,459 --> 02:26:16,875
'This is the truth. You are my love.'
