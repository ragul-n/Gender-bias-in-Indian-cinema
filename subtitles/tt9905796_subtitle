1
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,760
Here.
–Hey!

2
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,960
See this too.
–Come on!

3
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,160
Super!
–Thanks.

4
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Carry on.
–How can you leave me....

5
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,120
All the best.

6
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,760
Yes, we can do it.
–I wonder when he'll stop talking.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,720
Mom, I'll be there in 5 minutes.
–Hello, sir,...

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,400
...your mobile number
won a gift voucher.

9
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,600
That's not important,
put the phone down.

10
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,720
2 cups of cold coffee.

11
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,280
Why see the menu card so long
for 2 cups of cold coffee?

12
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,640
To drink?
–No, to smell.

13
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,800
The seat is for someone.

14
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,920
Shall I bring both the cups now?
–Why?

15
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,800
No, you asked the same before.
I brought 2 cups of cold coffee.

16
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,600
Then you cancelled it.
–No, bring both.

17
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,680
Hello! Hi!

18
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,800
It's okay, I'll wait for you.

19
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,840
I'm waiting too, sir.

20
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,440
Shall I bring the bill?

21
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,800
Excuse me, 2 cups of cold coffee.
–For you too? Here you go.

22
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
It's over, dude.
–Yes, it is. Can I get some rice?

23
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,440
I'll pour water
on your face.

24
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,400
I'm saying it's over
between me and Vidhya.

25
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,720
Vidhya is too good for you.
–How can you say that?

26
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,880
When have you been
in a relationship with her?

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,280
You were only ogling at her.

28
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,120
I just need to know.
Won't anything good happen to me?

29
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,600
Just look at it as if something
good has happened to Vidhya.

30
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,160
Dude, I'll smack you.
–What are you trying to say?

31
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,680
What am I to say?
I'm trying to meet her.

32
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,280
She kept postponing it for 3 week.
It seems she is busy at work.

33
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,760
I only ended up memorising
the menu card.

34
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,600
So another relationship
has ended.

35
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,360
How many girls has it been?
–It has become a joke to you.

36
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,400
We need to keep count,
so I asked.

37
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,040
Forget it, there are
many 'bulbs' in town.

38
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,800
I mean girls.
There are many fish in the sea.

39
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,560
I bet you'll catch one.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,440
But not all fish
will become Vidhya.

41
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,160
Enough, my ears hurts.
Don't expect too much.

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,640
Adjust and live accordingly.
Get me?

43
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,840
Life is.....
–Dude, shut up.

44
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,480
Then get me a chicken.

45
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,640
Look at his coat. How dare
he wear it in front of us!

46
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,720
Anyway, welcome to Kattappa Club.
–What does that mean?

47
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,280
Club for slaves, dude.
We've to listen to them hereafter.

48
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
He keeps escaping.
–Why?

49
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,160
He doesn't escape.
Girls escape from him.

50
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,200
Don't you want booze?
–It makes me feel bad.

51
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,640
Dude, I told you
about my school friend, Shreya.

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,080
She is here.
Come, let me introduce her to you.

53
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,480
Super, let's go.
–No, you wait here.

54
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,520
I'll go. Wait here.
–It's going to fail again.

55
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,200
Shreya!
–Okay, bye.

56
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,360
This is Rajeev, my college mate.
And my close friend.

57
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,040
Hi, nice to meet you.
–Please to meet you.

58
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,120
Okay, you guys keep
each other company. I'll leave.

59
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,800
Nice speech.
–Thanks.

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,600
No one else could have
said it better.

61
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,240
Did I sound like I was lying?
–Why? It wasn't like that.

62
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,680
Okay, enough about him.
Let's talk about us.

63
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,720
So, what do you do?
–No need for formalities.

64
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,960
Okay, what do you do?
–I'm a psychologist.

65
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,880
I'm a student counsellor
in a school?

66
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,200
Nice.
–What do you do?

67
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,280
Okay. What do you do?

68
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,640
I'm in HG, the regional
sales manager of Tamil Nadu.

69
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,600
HG consumer products?
–Yeah.

70
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,600
I want a discount then.
–Sure, as long as you don't ask...

71
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,240
...for free.
–I may even ask.

72
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,680
Looks like it has worked.
Hi, I'm Murali.

73
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,120
His wife's name is Priya.
–Why must you say that to me?

74
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
No, he's telling you I'm married.
Nothing else.

75
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,200
You said you were going to leave.
–I will.

76
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,560
Briyani is good. Enjoy it.
–Sure.

77
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,640
Okay, can we take a selfie?

78
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,200
My phone has no balance.
Can we use your phone?

79
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,320
Dude, come over here.
The height will be just right.

80
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,480
I can see that.
Look over there.

81
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,520
Can you send this photo
to his number?

82
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,400
Number, right? I'll send.
–Not bad, 4G speed.

83
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,680
Win her fast.
–Hi, Raju. I came to see you.

84
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,280
Hello, Arokiam,
I wanted to meet you. Let's go.

85
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,280
Hello, my name isn't Arokiam.

86
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,000
What did he mean?
–Why are you asking now?

87
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,360
Nothing, after having briyani
in any party,...

88
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,600
...we'll workout in the gym.
–That's great, Rajeev.

89
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,680
He's a pain.
He's a fan of Erode Mahesh.

90
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,240
Okay. That workout?
–Want some more briyani?

91
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,600
Bye!
–Bye!

92
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,200
See you soon.

93
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,960
That's my number.

94
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,680
<i>The clouds are heading west...</i>

95
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,880
Whom are they looking for...

96
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,960
<i>It is drizzling on us</i>
<i>from far...</i>

97
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,320
<i>It is looking for us...</i>

98
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,600
<i>The path that I'm taking,</i>
<i>it should go on and on...</i>

99
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,040
<i>The intoxication</i>
<i>in both hearts is unknown...</i>

100
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,920
<i>Earth behaved strangely...</i>

101
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,120
<i>It is reaching for our love...</i>

102
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,160
<i>The clouds are heading west...</i>

103
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,680
<i>Whom are they looking for...</i>

104
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,440
<i>It is drizzling on us</i>
<i>from far...</i>

105
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,920
<i>It is looking for us...</i>

106
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,760
<i>Truth and lie...</i>

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,120
<i>The moment truth chances...</i>

108
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,080
<i>They go hand in hand, they</i>
<i>combine and play their part...</i>

109
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,840
<i>The heart that doesn't</i>
<i>understand get excited...</i>

110
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,240
<i>This is a new introduction...</i>

111
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,960
<i>A new feeling...</i>

112
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,440
<i>Where will it take you...</i>

113
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,000
<i>Love...</i>

114
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,160
<i>A moment on</i>
<i>an ice–capped mountain...</i>

115
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,640
<i>The next moment on a volcano...</i>

116
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,640
<i>Love gave many such riddles...</i>

117
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,600
<i>The clouds are heading west...</i>

118
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,120
Whom are they looking for...

119
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,880
<i>It is drizzling on us</i>
<i>from far...</i>

120
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,720
<i>It is looking for us...</i>

121
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,320
<i>The skin that changes</i>
<i>ever so often...</i>

122
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,360
<i>Lovely language melt</i>
<i>like snow...</i>

123
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,160
<i>A face with no expression...</i>

124
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,160
<i>A new relationship...</i>

125
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,320
<i>My heart seeks...</i>

126
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,040
<i>Life spread happiness...</i>

127
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,240
<i>Eyes that speak...</i>

128
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,920
<i>It creates a rainbow</i>
<i>in the heart...</i>

129
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,000
The clouds are heading west...

130
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,200
<i>Whom are they looking for...</i>

131
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,320
<i>It is drizzling on us</i>
<i>from far...</i>

132
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,720
<i>It is looking for us...</i>

133
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,960
<i>The path that I'm taking,</i>
it should go on and on...

134
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,400
<i>The intoxication</i>
<i>in both hearts is unknown...</i>

135
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,360
<i>Earth behaved strangely...</i>

136
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,160
<i>It is reaching for our love...</i>

137
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,200
Dad, can we buy the land?
–Which land?

138
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,920
The land I told you,
it's in Sholanganallur.

139
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,680
It's a great offer, dad.

140
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,760
We're still paying
for the apartment.

141
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,520
Do we need to make
another investment now?

142
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,600
Dad, I'm only investing
in a land which is safe.

143
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,840
Why are you worried?
–I'm only saying what I think.

144
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay, dad, I won't buy it.

145
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,400
Each time I come back
from Bangalore, I get bad news.

146
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,920
Next, go to Hosur.
We'll see if you get any good news.

147
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,760
Your number plan was low last year.
Quarterly was low too.

148
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,680
Quarter (booze) is always low.

149
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,360
How do I give you manpower
with this figure?

150
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,960
How would you justify yourself?
–How? Tell us.

151
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
We have issues on quality.
We received complaints too.

152
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,480
Without addressing them, we can't
increase the figures alone.

153
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,040
These are excuses, I hate them.
–Sure, sir.

154
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,640
No point telling
the service team here.

155
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,080
They did not take any action.
We have told their heads.

156
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,080
It has been sorted out.
So, we'll surely reach our target.

157
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,640
I'm confident about it.

158
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,840
I always appreciate
your confidence.

159
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,120
We cannot achieve his target.
He talks rubbish.

160
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,560
Quiet, but.....

161
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,920
We will achieve it.

162
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,080
Before we win a girl,
we'll look forward for her calls.

163
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,960
Once we win them,
we get irritated when they call.

164
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,080
I feel the same.
–I meant you. She doesn't call me.

165
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,800
See, do you feel anything?
–Sneha is calling.

166
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,760
It's Snehan,
I saved it with a lady's name.

167
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,600
Brother, have the angels left?
They have left.

168
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,640
Must we leave this early?
–Yes, grandma is here.

169
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,120
I need to go home early.
–Grandma? You didn't tell me.

170
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
I told you
over the phone yesterday.

171
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,440
Is it? I must have forgotten
with the stress at work.

172
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,160
Is it stress at work or
you didn't hear it properly?

173
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,240
It's nothing, come on.

174
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,440
What's your plan tomorrow?
Can we meet?

175
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,080
Tomorrow, I have office work.
It'll be tough.

176
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,880
We'll see.

177
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,440
Hello!
–Hello!

178
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,840
I am busy now,
I'll call you back later.

179
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,160
<i>When?</i>
–Around 2. Okay? Bye, Shreya.

180
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,360
Welcome, sir.
–Table for 3 of us. Shall we go?

181
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,440
Rajeev! Hi!
–Hey!

182
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,320
Hi, uncle.
–Welcome. How are you?

183
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,120
You didn't tell me.
–You didn't tell me either.

184
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Sudden plan.
–Hi!

185
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,480
They are Rajeev's parents.
–Vanakkam!

186
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
Hey, little girl.
–Hi!

187
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,160
How is grandma, aunty?
–She is fine.

188
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,800
Rajeev is a good boy.
–Dad, keep them company.

189
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,280
Look after them.
–Your daughter, Shreya,...

190
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,080
...is a good girl.

191
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,920
How long have you been dating?
–About 5 months now.

192
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,880
Right? Yes.

193
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,520
We can only talk to a girl
after marriage during our time.

194
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,800
Dad, thank God
we weren't born in your time.

195
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,560
That's true.
–If you go out like this,...

196
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,760
...when will you settle down?
–We haven't thought about it.

197
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,760
We'll think about it later.
–Only your generation...

198
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,960
...needs time to think.
Think about it.

199
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,160
Do you plan to get married?

200
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,280
Because now, we have to ask
our children to find out.

201
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Rajeev, the family looks
like a nice family.

202
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,840
Shreya is a good girl too.
You have a good job too.

203
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,840
If we get you married soon,
we'll be at peace.

204
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,520
<i>Even if we found a girl for you,</i>
<i>we wouldn't have found...</i>

205
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,400
<i>...someone like her.</i>

206
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,720
You look nice, very beautiful.
–Me or the sari?

207
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,120
Both.
–Thank you.

208
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,640
He loved a girl in college.
What's her name? Rajendran?

209
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,920
Rajeswari.
–Yes, like a bald carrot.

210
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,960
He used to torture us
during that time.

211
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,040
He won't let us sleep,
he'll keep reciting his poems.

212
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,440
Look, a romantic film
is going on here.

213
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,120
Good man!
–Shall we talk with our eyes too?

214
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,560
I can't take it when you open
your mouth. Give your eyes a rest.

215
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,600
Why do you do this?
–Murali looks good in dhoti.

216
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,680
You could have worn one too.
–Traitor! I would have...

217
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,640
...if he had told me. Give!
–Come on, our size is different.

218
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,120
I hope you are not offended.
–Why such a big gift?

219
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,400
A gift is something
we should not forget.

220
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,760
What is it?
–I forgot.

221
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,520
What's in here?
–Are you sure it is yours?

222
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,960
We took a selfie ages ago.
Please take one.

223
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,320
Take a selfie.

224
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,160
No, that hand would be better.
–Then you take it.

225
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,960
You do it well. Do it.
–Make sure all of us are inside.

226
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,320
Okay.

227
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,160
Do you still write poems?
–I have a poem. Want to listen?

228
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,200
No, don't get whacked on stage.
Look into the camera.

229
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,040
Why were you looking as if you were
seeing me for the first time?

230
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,880
First time
I'm seeing you in a sari.

231
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,160
But I'm the same old Shreya.

232
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,320
Where is the Diet Coke?
–Diet Coke? I thought you bought.

233
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,840
Only one day.
Drink, nothing will happen.

234
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,200
No, I just read a research paper.
Whisky plus water,...

235
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,000
...bad for the heart.
Vodka plus water, bad for liver.

236
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,680
Brandy plus water, bad for kidney.
So where is the problem?

237
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,480
Where?
–Water.

238
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,000
I drink Diet Coke.
I eat diet bajji and diet bonda.

239
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,520
If you add the word diet before
any food, will it be diet food?

240
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,840
Get me the diet chips.
Pass it for me.

241
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,000
Forget it. Cheers.
–Cheers.

242
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,400
To my wedding.

243
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,360
Dude, what are you saying?
When did this happen?

244
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,320
Yes, everything is over.
–Everything over?

245
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,680
I mean my engagement.
–You're giving too many shocks.

246
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,800
I can't believe myself.
What to do?

247
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,640
So it is Shreya.
–It is fated I marry her.

248
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,360
Why do you sound disappointed?
Shreya is a good girl.

249
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,560
She is good, I'm not denying it.
It's not that I hate her, but.....

250
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,280
No spark?
–Yes.

251
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,040
Touch the wire, there'll be spark.
–Hey!

252
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,440
What? If you keep saying this,
there won't be anything at all.

253
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,840
Spark and arrows in the heart
only happen in movies.

254
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,480
If you keep doing this 5 years,
the expiry date will end.

255
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,480
What are you saying?
–The alarm will die off.

256
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,200
Quiet, that won't happen.

257
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
What we want
won't happen in life.

258
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,840
And my life is no exception.

259
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,800
After marriage,
we'll stay here for some time.

260
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,720
Then we can stay on our own.
–This is good enough.

261
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't mind anything.

262
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,400
Thank you.

263
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,840
Hi, I'm Rajeev.
–Hi, I'm Revathi.

264
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,400
Okay, I've been observing you.
You were covering...

265
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,080
...every small aspect.
–I'll show you.

266
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,560
This is nice.

267
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,600
Great!

268
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,040
I realise how beautiful they are
after looking at this photo.

269
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,800
Thank you.
–Is everything okay for you?

270
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,160
Yeah, it is okay.
–Hi, sir, he wanted to meet you.

271
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,440
Hello, sir.
–How can I help you?

272
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,280
The products are good.
When are they coming to the market?

273
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,320
So, is it over?
–Yeah, nice meeting you, Rajeev.

274
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,160
Same here.

275
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,040
If you're free tomorrow,
can we meet for coffee?

276
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,080
Why?
–To discuss our country's...

277
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,080
...economic policy.
–Sure, why not?

278
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,400
Just note down my number.

279
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,440
Welcome, sir.
Take a seat.

280
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,840
No, I'll sit there.

281
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Sir, change of location?

282
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,160
Okay.....
–As usual, 2 cups cold coffee.

283
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,240
And you want it right away.

284
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,800
Raja, I told you, right?
He's here.

285
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,640
In another 5 minutes,
he'll return his order.

286
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,760
What if someone comes for sure?
–No one will come.

287
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,720
Look at her.

288
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,720
Hi!
–Hi!

289
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,800
How are you?
–I'm good.

290
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,320
She is here.
He will pay then.

291
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,280
I wanted to ask you?

292
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,480
You were not interested
when you covered...

293
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,360
...our event. But you enjoyed
taking the other shots.

294
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,080
Looks like you noticed me well.

295
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,040
Actually I like fine arts...

296
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,960
...and wildlife photography.
–Okay.

297
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,400
But it is tough
to get jobs in this area.

298
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,880
And it's rare for me to find
those jobs.

299
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,640
So, to meet my monthly commitments,
I do boring assignments.

300
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,520
Boring?

301
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,560
Sorry, that's how I felt.

302
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,880
I hate it.
–Why?

303
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
My wife fights with me
for everything.

304
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,520
Whom did you touch?
–The maid.

305
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,040
No, I was watching the maid shower.
–Hey!

306
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,360
My wife suspected me
like this too.

307
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,720
I had a doubt that
she was using my wife's soap.

308
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,520
I was watching her
to clear my doubt.

309
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,360
She used it as a reason
to fight with me.

310
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,240
When they decide to fight,
they don't need a reason.

311
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,680
What other reason would one need
to fight with you?

312
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,040
Fine, why am I telling you?

313
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,800
You'll be getting married
in a month.

314
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,440
Have you decided
where to go for your honeymoon?

315
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,360
No, I wanted to discuss.....

316
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,120
When you reach, don't grab her.

317
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,680
Leave her on the first day.
Second and third day.....

318
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,480
Just a minute, not about honeymoon.
It's about the wedding.

319
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,760
Fine.
–Here, drink this Diet Coke.

320
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,360
I bought it for you.
–I did not ask,...

321
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,240
...but you bought it for me.
I think you've a big announcement.

322
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,880
Right. You didn't come
for the product launch yesterday.

323
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,000
I met a girl there.
Her name is Revathi.

324
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,320
She covered the event.
–And you covered her.

325
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,800
This happens only when
I am not there. Is she pretty?

326
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,440
I wouldn't say she's pretty.
But she had something.

327
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,920
You know I do not look at a girl
just because of her beauty.

328
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,120
Then what do you see?

329
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,240
Why do you give shock me
each time we meet?

330
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,960
We did not only meet. We went
to the coffee shop afterwards.

331
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,240
When we spoke.....

332
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,840
Remember I mentioned about spark?

333
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,880
I felt the spark.
And the vibration too.

334
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,480
Your phone?
–In my heart.

335
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,800
The chemistry
was excellent between us.

336
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,560
You're talking
about chemistry and vibration.

337
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,120
Those words do not relate to you.
I haven't seen you this way.

338
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,160
Have you fallen for her?

339
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,480
I don't know.

340
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,240
I don't know if I should
live half–heartedly...

341
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,320
...with the girl
I got engaged to...

342
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,120
...or if I should live
with my dream girl,...

343
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,720
...the love of my live.

344
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,600
What do you like in her?

345
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,840
The way she carried herself.....
–Carry bag.....

346
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,800
She is independent in nature.

347
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,840
Her expression.

348
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,880
She is an interesting girl.

349
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,680
But I know Shreya is a good girl.
I pity her, I won't deny that.

350
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,600
I am not sure if I will find
a prettier girl than her or not.

351
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,840
But I can't marry her.

352
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,280
My heart doesn't beat for her.
But at the same time,...

353
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,760
...I can't let Revathi go.

354
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,000
You don't seem confused to me.

355
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,360
You've decided, you're only looking
for a reason to justify it.

356
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,040
Dude, you are great.
You are great in this aspect.

357
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,840
Right, dude. Here,
it is telling me to go for Revathi.

358
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,320
If she is meant for you,
no one can change that.

359
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,120
What now? You have decided.
Break up with Shreya.

360
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,920
Love is a wonderful feeling.
You've been waiting for it...

361
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,800
...for so long. Look here,
this is how great things happen.

362
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,680
They happen
when we least expect it.

363
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,160
She is the right person for it.
Otherwise, you'll be fighting...

364
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,320
...every day just like me.
Go and tell her.

365
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,520
What are you saying?

366
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,840
Heard that?
He is not respecting us.

367
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,520
He doesn't even bother
about the girl.

368
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,520
He thinks about himself,
he does what he wants.

369
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,480
Let him go to hell.

370
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,480
He is earning now.
He can lead his own life.

371
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,080
He can decide on his own.

372
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,680
I won't interfere
in his life hereafter.

373
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
Dad, it's not like that.

374
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
Hi!
–Hi!

375
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,840
How was your Bangalore trip?
–It was great.

376
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,840
But I missed you very much.

377
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,000
How was your product launch?
–It was great.

378
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,800
Sit down.

379
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,480
Shreya, we need to talk.

380
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,480
I'm sorry, Shreya, I don't think
it will work between us.

381
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,200
No, it is not you.
It is because of me.

382
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,360
You know I really care about you.
But there is no love...

383
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,560
...or passion in our relationship.
I tried my best.

384
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,440
But I couldn't.

385
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,000
It has been ages
since we went out together.

386
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah.

387
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,880
Ever since you fell in love,
we hardly go out.

388
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,320
I'm going to see how often
we go out when you fall in love.

389
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,520
We'll see.
That is only if I fall in love.

390
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,800
Why are you smiling?
–It's nothing, mom.

391
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,120
I'm going to sleep.
Bye! Good night.

392
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,720
Bye.
–Bye!

393
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,120
Shall we send a message?

394
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,920
Okay.

395
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,160
Come on.

396
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,400
There is a message.

397
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,680
Okay.

398
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,720
Okay!

399
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,720
Why do you keep laughing?
There is something. What is it?

400
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,600
Nothing.
–I've been watching from morning.

401
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,040
You're laughing like a crazy.
What's happening? Tell me.

402
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,040
Are you in love?

403
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,680
I'm so excited for you.

404
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,800
Who is it?

405
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,480
Andrew's college mate.
I met him when I went...

406
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,560
...for his wedding reception.
Sweet, smart and handsome guy.

407
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,080
He talks very well.

408
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,440
Then we started
messaging each other.

409
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,800
I am meeting him again tomorrow.
–I'm so happy for you.

410
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,520
I have to go now.
But you must keep me updated, okay?

411
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,960
Okay.

412
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,960
You don't dress properly.
Look at your hair.

413
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,280
You don't want to study.
And you don't seem to listen.

414
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,520
Why do you do this?
–Sir, why are you scolding Vikram?

415
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
I don't think
this will end, Shreya.

416
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,240
We have given him one last chance.

417
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,880
And he behaves violently too.

418
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,600
He failed 2 subjects.
His attendance is irregular.

419
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,880
We must call his parents.
–Wait, sir,...

420
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,800
...give him another chance.
I'll talk to him again.

421
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,920
I see progress in our session.
Please give us one more chance.

422
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,360
Your wish. I don't think
it will work out.

423
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,720
Come on.

424
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,760
Tell me, what is your problem?

425
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,360
You don't like to study.
Fine.

426
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,520
But you want
to become an artist, right?

427
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,960
But you need to pass your 12th.

428
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,480
Or no university will accept you.

429
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,920
You know that, don't you?
–But I hate studying, madam.

430
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,920
What subjects are tough for you?
Math and physics?

431
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,280
There is an art quiz in Pune.
To get admission,...

432
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,080
...the school must recommend you.
You will get a scholarship.

433
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,160
When I found out about it,
I thought about you.

434
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,800
I can get it for you.
But for that, you must score...

435
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,160
...minimum 50%
in all the subjects.

436
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,680
Thank you so much, madam.

437
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,240
I'll get the marks, I promise.

438
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,760
Hello!
So, can we meet this evening?

439
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,360
Okay, sure.
–5 pm at the coffee shop?

440
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,480
Why not?

441
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,560
Mom, where is my coffee?
–I'll make some for you.

442
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Can you help cut
the carrot for me?

443
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,440
Your aunt's daughter, Kritiga,
has a problem with her husband.

444
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,680
Mom, did you hear about Kritiga?
–What am I talking about now?

445
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,360
Where is your attention?

446
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Fine, here you go.
Take your coffee and go.

447
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,240
I'll do the cutting.

448
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,680
I didn't add sugar.
Add it yourself.

449
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,600
Trying tasting it.

450
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,440
You didn't
even know you added salt.

451
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,840
Even after tasting it,
you didn't realise.

452
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,760
What happened to you?

453
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,640
Why didn't you tell me?
–I want you to leave now.

454
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,200
Silly girl!

455
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,920
Bye!

456
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,920
Hello!
<i>–Hey, Shreya.</i>

457
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,600
<i>Sorry, I forgot.</i>
<i>Today is Saturday evening.</i>

458
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,920
<i>I have to teach</i>
<i>in a special school today.</i>

459
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,520
<i>You can come there.</i>
<i>Can we meet there?</i>

460
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,760
Sure.

461
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,760
Sorry for what happened
to our date.

462
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,000
Not at all,
You are doing a great job.

463
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,840
I didn't expect you to do this.
–Do your work.

464
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,680
<i>From the corner of my eye...</i>

465
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,120
<i>I question my love...</i>

466
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,400
<i>Why do you kill me...</i>

467
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,200
<i>Do you think a girl's heart</i>
<i>is a candle...</i>

468
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,520
<i>Why do you take advantage...</i>

469
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,400
<i>Tell me about your love...</i>

470
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,360
<i>My life needs it...</i>

471
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,480
<i>Tell me how you feel...</i>

472
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,800
<i>My life...</i>

473
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,520
<i>Tell me your dream...</i>

474
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,560
<i>My eyes are asking...</i>

475
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,120
<i>Tell me what is</i>
<i>in your heart...</i>

476
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,360
<i>My life...</i>

477
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,360
<i>From the corner of my eye...</i>

478
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,800
<i>I question my love...</i>

479
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,440
<i>Why do you kill me...</i>

480
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,800
<i>Like a mirror...</i>

481
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,360
<i>Love is just as fragile...</i>

482
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,800
<i>As you live in your heart,</i>
<i>don't crumble...</i>

483
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,200
<i>What happened to us...</i>

484
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,480
<i>What shall I say about it...</i>

485
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,720
<i>My heart...</i>

486
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,600
<i>It is not a ball for you</i>
<i>to kick around...</i>

487
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,680
<i>My heart...</i>

488
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,840
<i>You failed to understand...</i>

489
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,400
<i>You failed to listen</i>
<i>to my dream...</i>

490
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,000
<i>What can I say...</i>

491
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,800
<i>I slowly started</i>
<i>feeling the pain...</i>

492
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,280
<i>Shall I tell you</i>
<i>what pains my heart...</i>

493
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,680
<i>Tell me about your love...</i>

494
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,640
<i>My life needs it...</i>

495
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,800
<i>Tell me how you feel...</i>

496
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,160
<i>My life...</i>

497
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,000
<i>Tell me your dream...</i>

498
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,040
<i>My eyes are asking...</i>

499
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,960
<i>Tell me what is</i>
<i>in your heart...</i>

500
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,680
<i>My life...</i>

501
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,640
<i>From the corner of my eye...</i>

502
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,000
<i>I question my love...</i>

503
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,280
<i>Why do you kill me...</i>

504
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,920
Sometimes, he looks at me
with so much love.

505
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,120
Then all of a sudden, it will seem
like he doesn't know me.

506
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,720
I don't seem
to understand anything.

507
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,400
I can't even talk to him.

508
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,640
Even I call him, no response.

509
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,000
When I send him a message,
he only replies occasionally.

510
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,640
I don't seem
to be getting something.

511
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,720
Shreya, I don't think
this will work out.

512
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,520
He is a nice guy.

513
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,520
But he looks like he is waiting
for something better to come.

514
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,080
And you are investing
a lot in this relationship.

515
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,880
I feel like he is not serious.

516
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,760
Think before you decide.
Before you get hurt,...

517
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,480
...decide what you want.

518
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,400
Hi, Rajeev.
<i>–Shreya, can we meet for coffee?</i>

519
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,240
<i>Our usual place, at 6 pm?</i>
–Today will be tough.

520
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,200
We have staff meeting.
<i>–I'll be busy 4 days.</i>

521
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,960
<i>I won't be able to see you.</i>

522
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,360
Okay, I'll come.

523
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,600
Where are you going?
Coffee with Rajeev?

524
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,760
No one can change you.

525
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,080
Can you do me a favour?

526
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,640
Update me about the staff meeting.
–Remember what I told you.

527
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,960
You are so sweet.

528
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,000
Hey, am I very late?
Sorry.

529
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,480
Sit down.

530
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,000
You could have called and told me,
at least a message.

531
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,840
I would have. But something
came up at the last minute.

532
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
I completely forgot.
–Typical you.

533
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,040
Forget it. I am very hungry.
Let's order.

534
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,880
You are late. Give, I'll order.
–Get me something spicy.

535
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,080
Then he spoke
as if nothing happened.

536
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,760
As usual, his work,
targets, deadlines, numbers.

537
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,000
I bet you wouldn't have
said anything.

538
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,120
What am I to say?
The world is revolving for him.

539
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,440
So, he doesn't answer
when you call.

540
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,320
He doesn't call back either.

541
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,600
That means, you are not
in his thoughts.

542
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,080
It means he has
some other girl in his life.

543
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,160
Why? He could be busy
with his work.

544
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:44,000
For men, office isn't their world.
They have another world too.

545
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,160
If you are not in that world,
it means someone else is in it.

546
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,760
Okay, what shall I do now?
–Go and ask him.

547
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,800
What do I ask?
–If he has any other girl?

548
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,240
Directly?
–Yes.

549
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,440
If I am not in his thought,
life is going on.

550
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,520
If I ask and things go wrong,
I'll botch the whole thing.

551
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,320
I get it. The same happened
between Harbajan and I.

552
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,040
Who is Harbajan?
–Don't analyse the specimen.

553
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,000
Analyse the situation.
–Okay, who is Harbajan?

554
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,640
Do you know Ashwin?
My boyfriend before him.

555
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,640
Want to drop it?
–I had liquor.

556
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,920
How can I meet your parents?
–Fool, there is no one home.

557
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,000
They are away.

558
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,320
The house looks good.
–Mom's design.

559
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,680
Really?

560
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,080
That on.....
–Guest room. Grandma stays there.

561
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,440
Is grandma here?
–Not now, she has gone home.

562
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,000
Okay, where is your room?
–I'll show you, come on.

563
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,360
This is where the magic happens.
–Magic? What magic?

564
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,040
All the magic.
–Really?

565
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,760
Show me the magic then.

566
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,080
Rajeev!
–Yeah?

567
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,800
I love you.
–I love you too.

568
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,440
Who was that? Are they back?
–No, they'll be back tomorrow.

569
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,680
I got scared for a minute.

570
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,320
Sorry. Hello!

571
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,360
Okay, I'll call back.

572
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,040
Okay.

573
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,200
Sorry.

574
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,480
I have to go.

575
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,480
Okay?

576
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,160
Bye!

577
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,080
Okay.

578
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,360
Bye!
–Bye!

579
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,600
When you kiss for the first time,
will you attend your call?

580
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,160
What? Seriously?
Are you sure?

581
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,480
I can't even believe it.

582
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,880
Probably he is a gay.

583
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,160
I was only kidding.

584
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,880
Vikram! I have good news.
–What is it?

585
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,200
The school accepted
your art course.

586
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,960
Thank you, madam.
–But remember what I told you.

587
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,160
Sure.

588
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,760
Hi, Rajeev.
Why didn't you call me?

589
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,760
Do you know how worried I was?
I couldn't even sleep last night.

590
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,080
What the hell, Rajeev?
Won't you even think?

591
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,080
Okay, I've got to go.

592
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,880
What are you doing here?
–Someone was angry.

593
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,680
So I came to visit.
–You want to apologise?

594
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,720
Even if I do,
you won't believe me, right?

595
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,920
What is there to believe?
–Look here.

596
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,320
I'm not avoiding you on purpose.
I was busy. Sorry.

597
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,920
Okay. It's great you came.
I didn't expect it.

598
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,880
So sweet of you!
–Okay, come on.

599
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,120
What are you doing?
–What?

600
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,840
This is a school.
Everyone will look.

601
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,240
No will look. What is wrong?
–Quiet!

602
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,520
Tell me fast,
I only have 30 seconds.

603
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,920
Did you ask him?
–No.

604
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:06,480
I know why you didn't ask.
Love is blossoming inside you.

605
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,400
If you ask him, you're afraid
the love tree in you will die.

606
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,480
Correct?
–How can you talk this way?

607
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,840
It came in a flow
as I was speaking to you.

608
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,640
Meghna!
–Okay, I've got to go. Bye!

609
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,320
Hello!
<i>–Happy birthday, baby.</i>

610
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,400
Thank you.
Where are you?

611
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,440
<i>At home. Where else?</i>
–So, you didn't come here?

612
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,960
<i>No, I've got to pack.</i>
<i>Early morning flight to Delhi.</i>

613
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,200
<i>I have to leave at 4 am.</i>
–When will you be back?

614
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,960
<i>Day after.</i>
–You won't be around...

615
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:57,560
...for my birthday then?
<i>–No, sorry. Got to leave.</i>

616
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,720
They told me only last night
about the meeting.

617
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,160
Okay.
<i>–So sorry.</i>

618
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,080
<i>We can celebrate this weekend.</i>
–Fine.

619
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,280
<i>Okay, I'll go and pack.</i>
–In school today, Vikram.....

620
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,880
<i>I need to pack,</i>
<i>I'll call you once I am back.</i>

621
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,160
<i>Okay? Bye.</i>

622
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,160
He did not only say bad words,
he also threw his geometry box.

623
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,320
We must take
strict disciplinary action.

624
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,160
We have to suspend him.
–We also have to cancel...

625
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,160
...our recommendation for him.
–No need to cancel that.

626
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,960
Suspension is enough.
–He is a useless student.

627
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,680
Don't keep supporting him.
Support good students.

628
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,840
What shall we do
with our problematic students?

629
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,320
Shall we expel them?
As a teacher,...

630
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,880
...don't label
any student as useless.

631
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,120
It will reflect badly on you.
–How can you say that to me?

632
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,560
Okay, don't take it personally.

633
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,160
After doing so much,
must we still recommend him?

634
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,120
Yes, sir, definitely.
He has shown lots of improvement.

635
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,240
He is counting on it.
What he did is wrong.

636
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,840
For that, let's suspend him.
Punishment should be proportionate.

637
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,560
Don't over react.
–No, I can't accept it.

638
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,840
He scolded you, fine,
why did he scold you.

639
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,000
He was talking
to his neighbour in class.

640
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,640
My class was disturbed....
–How did you scold him?

641
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,640
Are you saying it is my mistake?
–He is a sensitive student.

642
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,160
A problematic student.
After so many sessions,...

643
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,440
...he is showing some improvement.
He passed all his papers.

644
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,320
We have to be mindful of him.
We must not make him...

645
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,200
...do any mistake. I'm sorry.
How you scolded him is important.

646
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,680
If you scolded him in a way
that it hurt his self–esteem,...

647
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,560
...his reaction was natural.
–Are you justifying his action?

648
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,040
You are taking his job
too seriously.

649
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,120
We must try to stop a problem
from growing too big.

650
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,920
That is why you are
a student counsellor here.

651
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,680
If we do not take strong action,
other kids will get spoilt too.

652
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,320
People won't get scared.

653
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Thanks for explaining my role
as a student counsellor.

654
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,360
I can understand your point.
It will be difficult.

655
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,840
But we cannot recommend him.
We must maintain...

656
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,600
...the school's discipline
and decorum.

657
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,720
We cannot compromise.
–No, sir, this will have...

658
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,480
...some serious consequences.
–Don't worry, nothing will happen.

659
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,080
Don't take it
too serious or personal.

660
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,400
What am I doing here?
Like the man said,...

661
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,480
...it's meaningless
to be a student counsellor.

662
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,240
It's easier to handle
the students than teachers.

663
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,040
So much of ego.

664
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,960
How can they show this much
of ego to a student?

665
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,480
I didn't expect the principal
to take such serious action.

666
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,040
Hello!
<i>–Hey, I'm busy, I'll call back.</i>

667
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,400
When?
<i>–Around 2.</i>

668
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,840
2 o'clock? Okay.

669
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,960
Does he know about the sessions?
–He hasn't asked about my work.

670
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,040
I have to tell him.

671
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,760
Why must I tell him about
my work and bore him...

672
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,240
...when he is not interested?
–You are crazy.

673
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,200
I know that.

674
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,520
You are losing
your self–respect, Shreya.

675
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,200
He is plain toxic.

676
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,920
You get weak when someone
gets close to you.

677
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,440
It will hurt one day.

678
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,880
When you love
and care for someone,...

679
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,680
...make sure
he is well worth the risk.

680
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,240
You told me these things
when I was dating the wrong guy.

681
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,800
But Rajeev isn't that sort.
Don't you worry.

682
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,680
Welcome, sir.
–Hello, table for 3 of us.

683
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,920
Rajeev! Hi!
–Hi, welcome. How are you?

684
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,200
You didn't tell me.
Dad, keep them company.

685
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,800
Look after them.
–Sure.

686
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,040
One minute, let's take
a photo together.

687
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,560
Congratulations, dude.
–Thanks.

688
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,960
Congrats.

689
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,120
You received a message.

690
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,560
It could be Rajeev.
–I don't think so.

691
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,040
Why keep talking
about your phone? Eat.

692
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,560
Why are you always
on your phone?

693
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,920
Put it away and eat.

694
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,000
Shreya, do you think
this is right?

695
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,560
Yes, don't you worry about it.

696
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,920
You have changed.
He has changed too.

697
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,040
I definitely think
this is not a good idea.

698
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,120
He is not the right person
to marry.

699
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,680
Please it isn't too late.
You have time to walk away.

700
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,960
Why do you speak this way?
He was acting strange before.

701
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,320
But if he is not fully committed,
why did he agree to get married?

702
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,240
Crazy!
–I've said what I think is right.

703
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,120
Poorni, enough.
Let's not talk about this.

704
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,160
Hey!

705
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,560
Hi, someone said
she wasn't in the mood.

706
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,040
So I came immediately.
–I felt that way.

707
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,640
But now I feel better.
–Okay.

708
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,440
May I ask you something?
–Okay.

709
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,560
Will you only come when I am down?
–My mistake for coming here!

710
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,120
I was only joking.
You are my love.

711
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,240
I'll be happy whenever
you're near me.

712
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,160
Come on, let's go for a drive.

713
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,440
Hello!
<i>–Make it fast, Shreya. I'm busy.</i>

714
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,520
I'm in Bangalore.
So, I called.

715
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,760
<i>You could have messaged.</i>
<i>I have a product launch tomorrow.</i>

716
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:49,000
<i>I'll call you later.</i>
<i>Bye!</i>

717
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,160
I'm not saying anything.
Conference starts in 30 minutes.

718
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,480
Come, let's get ready.

719
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,120
How was Bangalore?
–It was great.

720
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,360
But I missed you a lot.
How was your product launch?

721
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,720
It was great. Sit down.

722
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,240
Shreya, we need to talk.

723
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,720
I'm sorry, I don't think
it will work between us.

724
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,720
No, it is not because of you.

725
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,440
It is me. You know
I really care about you.

726
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,200
But there is no love
and passion in our relationship.

727
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,040
I tried my best,
but I can't go on.

728
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:03,480
I know, I'll speak to your parents.
I'll explain to everyone.

729
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,800
I'm really sorry, Shreya.

730
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,400
Please, Shreya,
say something, scold or hit.

731
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,040
But don't be silent. Please!

732
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,760
<i>Wind...</i>

733
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,360
<i>Answer me before you go...</i>

734
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:47,520
<i>Why did you release poison</i>
<i>in the air, my love...</i>

735
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:53,520
<i>Why is you release poison</i>
<i>in the air, my love...</i>

736
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:59,480
<i>I am helpless now...</i>

737
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:05,440
<i>Why did you enact a drama</i>
<i>called love, my love...</i>

738
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:11,520
<i>Why did you enact a drama</i>
<i>called love, my love...</i>

739
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,840
<i>Wind...</i>

740
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,400
<i>Answer me before you go...</i>

741
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,440
You'll see the light
only when you're in darkness.

742
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,520
Everything is for the good.

743
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,640
A beautiful mountain.

744
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,360
When I climbed it,
each experience touched my heart.

745
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,160
Even though I was worried
I will fall,...

746
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,040
...the experiences
took me to the peak.

747
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,880
I'm falling now.

748
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,840
Rajeev Subramaniam.
If you want to move on,...

749
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,840
...unfriend him from Facebook.

750
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,840
Delete him from your contact list.

751
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:18,040
<i>I lit a light in the rain...</i>

752
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,440
<i>I lit a light in the rain...</i>

753
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,120
<i>Is it right to take away</i>
<i>what I have won...</i>

754
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:42,280
<i>Is it right to take away</i>
<i>what I have won...</i>

755
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,320
<i>There is a storm...</i>

756
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,120
<i>All my dreams shattered...</i>

757
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:53,600
<i>What shall I do with the kisses</i>
<i>I saved for you...</i>

758
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,040
I'm really sorry, Shreya.

759
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:05,080
What I did is wrong.
I realise how much I miss you.

760
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,360
Can we please get back?

761
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,360
<i>Wind...</i>

762
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,880
<i>Answer me before you go...</i>

<i>From every tear...</i>

767
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,880
<i>A part of me is melting away...</i>

768
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,240
<i>The memories that kill me...</i>

769
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,680
<i>I shall kill them...</i>

770
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,320
Hey, what is this?
You do not answer when I call.

771
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,080
You do not reply
when I send you a text.

772
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,840
How long will you
be like this?

773
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,240
Enough, come on. Get up!
Let's go out. Come!

774
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,960
I don't want to come.
–Listen to me.

775
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,640
Come, let's go out.
–I'm not in the mood.

776
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,360
It'll be a change.
How long will you be like this?

777
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,600
Come, let's go.
Come on, get up!

778
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,680
Hey, don't worry.

779
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:08,240
Soon, someone will come
into your life.

780
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,120
Then you'll understand why
this engagement did not work out...

781
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,760
...and why you broke up.

782
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,040
What happened?

783
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,880
Why are you sitting as if
this is a funeral house?

784
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:29,840
Kritiga is divorced.
–Why, mom?

785
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,360
She is not a fool.
She knows what she is doing.

786
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,120
No matter what she decides,
it will be right.

787
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,720
Don't worry about this, mom.
–Now, girls opt for divorce...

788
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:47,120
...over small matters.
We must accommodate.

789
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,320
Life isn't a bed of roses.

790
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,560
We need to compromise.

791
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,800
In the name of compromise,
we lose ourselves.

792
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,760
Didn't you see
what I went through?

793
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,640
Everyone has a breaking point, mom.
Don't worry.

794
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,080
You asked me so many questions
the other day.

795
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,800
Was that a date or interview?
–A date of course.

796
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,200
Then ask personal questions.
–Personal questions?

797
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,000
Yes, okay, I'll ask you.
How many girlfriends do you have?

798
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,040
For now, only you.

799
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,120
Since when
I became your girlfriend?

800
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:46,480
Okay, shall I say to–be–girlfriend?
–Who agreed to that?

801
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,320
Don't hide anything.
Tell me about your past.

802
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:55,160
Past? There were
many infatuations.

803
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,840
But one serious relationship.
It was with a girl, Shreya.

804
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,680
When was that?
–If I tell you the truth,...

805
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,480
...you won't get scared, right?
–Not at all.

806
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,760
A few days ago.
Actually, do you know what?

807
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,440
I'll tell you the truth,
we were actually engaged.

808
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,800
Family pressure,
my friends were all married.

809
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,960
So, things happened fast.

810
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,200
But I felt guilty.

811
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,240
I gave it serious thought.

812
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,040
But I knew
it was not working out.

813
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,960
I felt that I was not
completely into Shreya.

814
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,720
So, I called it off.
My family was very upset with me.

815
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,400
I bet they would be.

816
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,040
But I thought that was
the right time to end it.

817
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,520
If I had waited,
we would have got married,...

818
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:54,560
...kids and all.
I didn't want to regret later.

819
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,480
Yes, I agree.
At least you told her boldly.

820
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,800
There are many cowards.
They won't tell the truth,...

821
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,880
...they'll be flirting
with other girls.

822
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,080
That much of anger in you?
Any experience?

823
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,960
Yes, remember I came to cover
your event the other day?

824
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:15,760
Yes.
–I broke up one day before.

825
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:20,680
I saw him out with another girl.
I broke it off immediately.

826
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,200
I'm really sorry.

827
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,400
What did you do?

828
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,440
Okay, I'll leave.

829
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,640
<i>Evil and ghost...</i>

830
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,080
<i>It is none other than love...</i>

831
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,320
<i>It can kill you...</i>

832
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,840
<i>You and me...</i>

833
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,160
<i>I say it is live...</i>

834
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:07,960
<i>A brand new feeling...</i>

835
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,920
<i>It infects the heart...</i>

836
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,440
<i>Lots of love...</i>

837
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,760
<i>I lug it in my heart...</i>

838
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:23,840
<i>More love</i>
<i>in the air around me...</i>

839
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:30,960
<i>It keeps me alive...</i>

840
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:38,800
<i>A brand new feeling...</i>

841
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,280
<i>It infects the heart...</i>

842
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,160
<i>Lots of love...</i>

843
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,880
<i>I lug it in my heart...</i>

844
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,600
<i>Don't steal my heart...</i>

845
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,400
<i>Don't move away from me...</i>

846
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,720
<i>Keep the fire alive...</i>

847
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,200
<i>Shower me with kisses...</i>

848
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,760
<i>You are a normal girl...</i>

849
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,120
<i>But I need you</i>
<i>for my survival...</i>

850
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:32,880
<i>You are not divine</i>
<i>or an angel...</i>

851
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,120
<i>You are my life...</i>

852
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:40,960
<i>The paint on my clothes</i>
<i>and the burden on my shoulder...</i>

853
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,880
<i>The slip away...</i>

854
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,760
<i>The stress that is in me...</i>

855
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,640
<i>Melts when you look at me...</i>

856
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:10,760
<i>A brand new feeling...</i>

857
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,920
<i>It infects the heart...</i>

858
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:18,320
<i>Lots of love...</i>

859
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,560
<i>I lug it in my heart...</i>

860
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:27,040
<i>More love</i>
<i>in the air around me...</i>

861
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:34,120
<i>It keeps me alive...</i>

862
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,680
<i>Don't steal my heart...</i>

863
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,600
<i>Don't move away from me...</i>

864
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,600
<i>Keep the fire alive...</i>

865
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,640
<i>Shower me with kisses...</i>

866
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,600
Must you go to work today?

867
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:08,800
When you ask in this position,
I feel like saying no.

868
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,400
No! I have an important
review meeting today.

869
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,120
I have to go today. Please!
–Okay.

870
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,600
Bye!
–Bye!

871
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,880
Dad, the car refused
to start again today.

872
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,280
It started after a while.

873
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,920
I feel like changing the car.

874
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,960
I can afford to get an
allowance for bank loan.

875
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,760
What do you say?

876
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:51,040
Dad, how long are you going
to give me the silent treatment?

877
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,520
It has been 2 months now.
I'm sorry, dad.

878
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,320
I couldn't accept Shreya.
That is why I broke off with her.

879
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,600
Please try to understand.
If we unwillingly get married,...

880
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,240
...it'll end up in divorce.

881
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,280
Sumathi, the boy who could change
his finance does not know...

882
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,200
...how to change his car.

883
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,760
What is this, mom?

884
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:23,760
Don't worry, Rajeev.
How long will they not talk to you?

885
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,640
Time is the best healer.

886
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,920
It will be great if we can
freeze this moment, right?

887
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,160
We must stay like this forever.

888
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,320
Any response
from the sales team?

889
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,920
Keep quiet. I haven't got
a blue tick for my message.

890
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:02,200
Let's go and see
the sales team then.

891
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,760
No, you fool.
She has a friend.

892
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,600
A real pain.

893
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:13,280
No, come on.
She is not only close to him,...

894
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,000
...she even went
to Cochin with him.

895
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,520
She doesn't answer her phone,
she doesn't reply my messages.

896
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,840
I'm so upset.
–Is this your problem?

897
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,520
Make sure you concentrate
in your work.

898
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,200
Month end is approaching.
You can find another girl.

899
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,240
But if you lose your job,
that's it. Okay?

900
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,280
It is already 6 pm.
Still no response from her.

901
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,000
I don't know what is going on?
–Probably they are in a room.....

902
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,320
Hey!
–They could be playing a card game.

903
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:50,440
Maybe she is avoiding me
for fighting with her yesterday.

904
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,880
Could be. What could
a girl be doing now?

905
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,240
We can ask if there
is a girl here, right?

906
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,800
What do you mean?
–Nothing.

907
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:03,360
Look, she will send you a message.
Don't read it immediately.

908
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,200
What is it?

909
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,080
She would say sorry
or that she missed you,...

910
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,560
...don't ever call her.

911
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,000
Hello! Hi, baby.
What.....

912
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,560
<i>The person you are dialing</i>
<i>seems unavailable...</i>

913
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,240
<i>...to take calls right now.</i>

914
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:51,080
Rajeev, it's you.
What a surprise. Come in.

915
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:56,080
Sorry, I missed your call.
–No problem, I'm here now.

916
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,120
I wanted to surprise you.

917
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,000
So, how was your day?

918
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,760
Day?

919
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,560
My work is about to start.
–Really?

920
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:08,440
I wanted to take you out.
–I can't come now.

921
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,160
Can't you do this work later?
–No, I have a deadline.

922
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:19,800
I hate postponing my work.
–You know how busy I am.

923
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,520
If I'm coming to see you with my
busy schedule, what does that mean?

924
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,520
I just want to spend
some time with you.

925
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,360
But I don't think you're taking
any effort to make...

926
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,240
...this relationship work.
–See, yours is a 9–7 job.

927
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,280
Mine is not like that.
I don't know when I'll get...

928
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,120
...my next assignment.

929
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,920
I'll call you after
my work is done, okay?

930
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,640
Hello!
–I'll call you later.

931
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,360
<i>Hey! You don't sound right.</i>
–It's nothing.

932
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,120
I just miss Rev.
She is busy with her work.

933
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,400
<i>You are with her all the time.</i>
<i>Can't you stay away from her...</i>

934
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,680
<i>...for some time? I'm waiting</i>
<i>for my wife to go back home.</i>

935
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:08,520
Come on now!

936
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:27,160
I forgot to tell you.
I'll be busy the next 3 days.

937
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,280
Month end,
I need to meet my target.

938
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,640
But I can't stay away
without seeing you.

939
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,440
Keep yourself free
on Thursday.

940
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,680
I want to spend
the evening with you, okay?

941
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,920
<i>I'm not sure if I'll be</i>
<i>free Thursday evening.</i>

942
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,840
Why?
<i>–I can't tell you now.</i>

943
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,440
<i>We'll see on that day. Okay?</i>
–Okay, I've told you.

944
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,480
Try to be free on Thursday.
<i>–Okay, I'll try.</i>

945
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,520
Okay, bye.

946
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,760
So you guys deal
with the client directly.

947
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,520
Dear Father in heaven!
That's how you sounded.

948
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,240
Are you guys excited?
–Yes, sir.

949
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,520
Are you sure you are excited?
–Yes, sir.

950
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,560
Is this your first day?
–Yes.

951
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,400
That's how it will be.
–To impress a client...

952
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,320
...is like impressing
a beautiful girl.

953
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,720
If she doesn't like to talk to you,
doesn't answer your call,...

954
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,440
...she avoids and hates you,
what should you do?

955
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,920
Look for another girl, right?
–Yes, sir.

956
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,520
He gets excited for everything.
–How will you impress her?

957
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,840
To start with, you should never
give up and never quit.

958
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,080
Treat your client
like your girlfriend.

959
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,800
Be loyal, take them out for coffee,
call them 3 times a day.

960
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:33,200
No matter what the situation is,
never give up or never quit,...

961
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,600
...just like me. Okay?
Can I hear that loud?

962
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,960
Never quit!
–Good. Thank you.

963
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,720
It was like a tuition session
for 12th Standard.

964
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:48,160
Was that for them or for yourself?
–Why do you do this?

965
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,000
Super! I called you Sottagopal.

966
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,560
Hello! Okay! Thank you.

967
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:20,360
All the best.
–You achieved like you said.

968
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,360
I didn't expect this. We did not
only achieve our target,...

969
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,040
...we exceeded it.
If Vinod was here now,...

970
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,600
...he would hug and kiss you.

971
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,600
I don't need Vinod,
I want my Revathi to hug me.

972
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,600
Me too.
I want Revathi to hug you.

973
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,080
Why do this?
–Okay, let's celebrate today.

974
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,960
Let's go to a pub.
No, we'll go to my house.

975
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,640
No way. I'm going to spend
the evening with Revathi.

976
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,960
See you at home this evening.
–I'll be out with Revathi.

977
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,680
Be on time this evening.

978
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,960
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is busy. Please try.....</i>

979
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,960
Hey, hi!
<i>–Rajeev, achieved your target?</i>

980
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:28,600
We exceeded our target.
<i>–That's great. Congrats.</i>

981
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,200
<i>I'm so happy for you.</i>
–Thank you.

982
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,240
<i>We'll celebrate this soon.</i>
–Definitely.

983
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,440
But why later?
Let's do it today.

984
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,480
I'll come
to your house this evening.

985
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,600
<i>Not today, come tomorrow.</i>
<i>I have a party today.</i>

986
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,600
Why is the party important?
<i>–Good photographers will come.</i>

987
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,720
<i>I want to go and do networking.</i>

988
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:55,080
Rev, I'll come with you.
<i>–No, I'll go alone.</i>

989
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,280
<i>I need to focus on work.</i>
–If I'm there, can't you focus?

990
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,200
<i>I need to talk to people.</i>
<i>If you come, you'll be alone.</i>

991
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,560
<i>I won't be able to concentrate.</i>
<i>Please try to understand.</i>

992
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,280
Rev, I didn't see you for 3 days.
I'm busy with work too.

993
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,440
But don't I spare time for you?
But you're making me beg.

994
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:18,080
<i>I didn't ask you to beg.</i>
<i>I have work, that's all.</i>

995
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,360
<i>We'll see tomorrow.</i>
<i>Don't argue over small matters.</i>

996
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:25,120
<i>Please, okay?</i>
–Fine, bye!

997
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,800
Come, have a glass.
–How did you know?

998
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,240
You prepared 2 glasses.
–I knew you'll come.

999
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,840
I won't tease you, drink.

1000
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,200
Why are we drinking at home?

1001
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,640
We got a call
my wife's husband is ill.

1002
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,880
She left.
–But that's you.

1003
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,640
Right, I wanted to send her.
So I lied, she left.

1004
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,160
Fool! Look at my plight.
I have to drink with you today.

1005
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,120
She embarrassed you.
So you're drinking here.

1006
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,160
If we expect too much,
nothing happens.

1007
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,440
Why expect anything? Just accept
whatever that comes along.

1008
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,360
Look, life is simple.
We complicate it for nothing.

1009
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,560
And that's you.
–Why won't you talk this way?

1010
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,920
She doesn't spend time with you.
Why is she your girlfriend?

1011
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,480
There is only one role
in our relationship.

1012
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,240
She is always right.
–Every relationship is like that.

1013
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,600
We must listen to the women.
–We exceeded our target today.

1014
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,800
It's such a big achievement.
We were so happy.

1015
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:26,000
But she did not feel happy.
We made it seem like a funeral.

1016
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,280
Let's listen to some songs.
Tamil, English or Hindi?

1017
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,840
Tamil will be fine.
–Why? Hindi will remind you...

1018
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,560
...of Shreya. English will
remind you of Revathi.

1019
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,920
Please, let me drink in peace.
–You have girls all over.

1020
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,640
Done.

1021
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,160
What's the use of our achievement?
Relationship means problem.

1022
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,360
How do lowers manage?
–I wonder how their friends...

1023
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,400
...are managing.

1024
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,600
What is the problem now?
What is the current fight about?

1025
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,080
It is a joke to you.
–Indeed.

1026
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:10,000
No, I don't get it.
Once a relationship is over,...

1027
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,400
...when you move on to another
person, you must remove...

1028
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,240
...your old flame's photo from FB.
–Only photos...

1029
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,120
...or are there videos too?
–Hey!

1030
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,680
I mean tour videos.
Is this even a fight?

1031
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,400
This is why I'm not on FB.
Only WhatsApp videos.

1032
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,040
Gajagaja Guys,
the group's name. I'm the admin.

1033
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,520
I apologised, right?

1034
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,680
I can't live without you.

1035
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:43,960
Let's go out.
–I'm not in the mood.

1036
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,480
Please, Rev, let's go out.

1037
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:51,920
Let's go.

1038
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:57,720
Okay, but where?
–Where else?

1039
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,960
The usual hangout.
Let's go to the coffee shop.

1040
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,080
Okay.

1041
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:13,200
Let's go.
–Aren't you going to change?

1042
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,600
I'm ready? Can't you see?
–Don't come like this.

1043
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,720
Use a dress for a change.
–Are you mad?

1044
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,720
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with this?

1045
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,160
It's nice.
If you dress like a girl...

1046
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,760
...if you wear salwar with
some makeup, you'll look pretty.

1047
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:43,560
God! You mess up each time.
Why do you do this?

1048
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:20,000
Sorry, guys, we'll have the meeting
tomorrow, okay? Not today.

1049
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,520
Do you know that
we are in a relationship?

1050
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,600
We'll get married soon.

1051
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,720
I'm trying my best to make it work,
but I don't see it coming from you.

1052
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,720
I called you so many times.
Sent so many messages.

1053
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,120
Did you return my call
or send one reply?

1054
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:59,760
Nothing at all.
–Good, you opened this topic.

1055
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,040
I was thinking too.

1056
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,120
This isn't working.

1057
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,200
It is not working.

1058
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,960
I want to break–up.
–Break–up?

1059
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:47,040
I am done with you.
I told you before.

1060
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,880
This is the last time.

1061
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,440
I won't tolerate
if you cheat on me again.

1062
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,520
I saw you with the girl again.
–No, Reva.

1063
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:58,280
The basis
of a relationship is trust.

1064
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:03,240
Once it is gone, it is over.
–I know, it is my mistake.

1065
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,760
Hereafter.....
–Pull over.

1066
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,440
What did you say? Mistake?

1067
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,120
Is it written here
that I'm a fool?

1068
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,480
Don't say this for fun.

1069
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,800
It's over and don't call me again.

1070
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,440
Reva, please.

1071
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,520
I'll see you around. Okay, bye.
–Okay, bye!

1072
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,720
Hello!
<i>–What's up? You called.</i>

1073
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,600
<i>I couldn't talk.</i>
<i>Sorry, I missed your call.</i>

1074
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,880
<i>I've been busy 2 days.</i>
<i>Tell me what's up.</i>

1075
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,840
Dad, I broke up with Sanjay.

1076
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:11,080
I saw him with another girl.
I couldn't accept it.

1077
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,160
That is the reason.

1078
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,240
<i>If you think it's right,</i>
<i>go ahead.</i>

1079
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,760
<i>Is everything all right?</i>
–I was sad then.

1080
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,240
I thought I would remain
single for some time.

1081
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,760
I wanted a break.

1082
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:27,720
But then,
I met a guy called Rajeev.

1083
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,600
I met him twice before that.

1084
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,880
I just met him,
I'm on my way home.

1085
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:40,080
<i>Good.</i>

1086
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,280
Sir!
–Yes, come in.

1087
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,640
Please sit down.
–Hello.

1088
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,880
Thanks.

1089
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:57,880
It looks like an art film.
It's not straight forward.

1090
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,560
I don't get what you're saying.
–I told you to take the event,...

1091
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,000
...but you covered the people.
Half is not clear.

1092
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,520
You took it from an angle.
How can we use this?

1093
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:12,760
We paid you for a job,
instead of doing what we want,...

1094
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,120
...you did as you wished.

1095
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:19,040
I told you not to
hire new photographers.

1096
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,360
And a girl.....
–Excuse me, sir.

1097
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,680
My gender has nothing to do
with this pictures.

1098
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,400
Do you know what the client said?
It seems my photos are bad.

1099
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:36,800
It because I am a girl.
I'm fed up of this silly logic.

1100
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,680
Irritating.
–Relax, Rev.

1101
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,360
Why are you so tense?

1102
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:46,400
I do not know why
I get such silly assignments.

1103
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:49,520
I want to make it interesting,
but they are not allowing me.

1104
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,120
Babe, this is purely business.

1105
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,960
We must do what
our pay masters say.

1106
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:59,360
But listen, you will get the
interesting project that you want.

1107
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,360
Patience, okay?

1108
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,080
I bet he's saying I'm a bad driver
because I'm a woman.

1109
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:16,600
As if all men drive well
and all women are bad drivers.

1110
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,960
Why are you so tensed?
Just calm down.

1111
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:29,120
Smile.
–Okay.

1112
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,320
Will you understand me?

1113
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,280
Most importantly,
will you support me?

1114
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,320
Definitely, baby.

1115
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,760
I have not seen anyone
so intense and passionate before.

1116
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,920
I must thank my parents
for everything...

1117
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,720
...for not restricting me.

1118
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:03,000
They allowed me to explore,
wander, try different things.

1119
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,040
I like to write and sketch.

1120
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,920
I used to go
bird watching with dad.

1121
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,120
Swimming,
I did whatever I liked.

1122
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,560
Whatever I fancied.

1123
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:22,720
After trying everything, I realised
that photography was my calling.

1124
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,360
Actually no.

1125
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,240
Before that.....

1126
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,440
Don't laugh, okay? Promise?

1127
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,800
I can't promise.
Tell me first.

1128
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,040
Okay!

1129
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,160
I wanted to be an actress,
that was my ambition.

1130
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,960
Actress?
–Why?

1131
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,280
I can't even imagine
seeing you as an actress.

1132
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,320
Why are you surprised?
Aren't I pretty?

1133
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:02,480
That's not it.
I can't imagine you as an actress.

1134
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,880
That is why I laughed.

1135
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,480
I like to imagine
how people's life would be,...

1136
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,880
...what they would be thinking.

1137
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,080
To be an actress,...

1138
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,160
...getting absorbed
into the character,...

1139
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,440
...to live as the character
is very interesting.

1140
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:37,520
I've been watching you,
you're always so serious.

1141
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,120
You!

1142
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,440
What?

1143
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:06,200
Rajeev, I can't believe
that you're like this.

1144
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:09,280
What so funny with this?

1145
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,240
Besides laughing,
you even shared with others.

1146
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,880
Why are you taking it seriously?
It is just for fun.

1147
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,160
Okay, I don't understand
your fun.

1148
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,840
If this is fun, I don't know
what to think about you.

1149
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,280
Hi!
–Nice pictures.

1150
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,840
Thank you so much.

1151
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,080
Hi!
–Hi!

1152
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,240
Your pictures turned out well.
–Thank you.

1153
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:59,160
Hi, Revathi!
–Hi!

1154
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,480
Gautham, I can't believe
you made it.

1155
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,920
You said you're not in town.
–Your first exhibition.

1156
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,760
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
We studied together.

1157
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,440
You didn't study.

1158
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:16,600
Rajeev, this is Gautham,
my college mate.

1159
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,600
This is Rajeev, my boyfriend.

1160
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,280
Rajeev, Gautham
is a photographer too.

1161
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,000
I'll show him around. Come.
–Yeah, sure.

1162
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,520
Bye!
–Thanks so much for coming.

1163
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,600
See you, Revathi.
–Bye!

1164
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,440
Bye.
–Thank you for coming.

1165
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,320
Very nice, congratulations.
–Thank you so much.

1166
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:57,200
Rajeev, where were you?
How was the exhibition?

1167
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:00,880
Great. How long must I wait?
–Sorry.

1168
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:04,160
Okay, leave it.
–Let's go.

1169
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:11,120
Why is your face like that?
–I hate Gautham.

1170
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,240
I'm seeing you jealous
for the first time.

1171
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,480
Rev, I'm very serious, okay?

1172
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,400
Rajeev, I'm very happy because
the exhibition was a success.

1173
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,720
Don't spoil it.

1174
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,240
What are you thinking?
–One good news.

1175
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:41,160
What is it?
–Gautham called.

1176
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,800
A project has been approved
by National Geography.

1177
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,920
Two photographers
will be going to Kerala.

1178
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,520
We'll be covering that area.

1179
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,720
Gautham and I are going to Kerala.

1180
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,400
What? You and Gautham
going to Kerala?

1181
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,120
What the hell is this, Revathi?

1182
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,920
One popcorn.

1183
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,680
Rs100, right?

1184
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:14,440
Rajeev, I know you won't be happy.
But you should be happy.

1185
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:18,920
You're yelling for nothing.
How can you suspect me this way?

1186
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,880
Look, I don't like it, period!
Okay?

1187
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:30,360
It's too bad.
If you trust me,...

1188
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,080
...you should allow me to decide
with whom I should work...

1189
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,120
...and talk to.

1190
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:39,400
Look, I trust you.
But this is not right.

1191
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,120
Rajeev, I can't fake it
like you want me to.

1192
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,680
I can't be a fake.

1193
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:07,520
Hey, Rajeev.
–Hi, baby.

1194
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:10,760
This or that?
–This one.

1195
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:14,200
I missed you so much.
–Me too.

1196
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,680
You'll have fun with Gautham.....
–Must you say that now?

1197
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,880
How would I know?
You must tell me.

1198
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,640
Seriously, Rajeev. So annoying.
What is your problem?

1199
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,920
Why this insecurity?
I am with you right now.

1200
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,600
I did not run with anyone.

1201
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,880
Or I was alone.....

1202
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,800
No, you didn't think
that way, right?

1203
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,840
I didn't think that way.
–Then shut up.

1204
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,680
Please don't be possessive.

1205
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,320
I don't like this character
of yours.

1206
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,560
Okay, I'm really sorry.
Don't be angry.

1207
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,880
I'm not lying.

1208
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,240
You are very pretty.
That's my fear.

1209
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,280
You're good at this.

1210
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,440
No, not now.
–Revs, you know I love you?

1211
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:09,000
I know.
–Then why?

1212
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,880
I'm very hungry.
Let's go out and eat.

1213
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:15,320
Hungry? Now?
–Yes.

1214
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,120
Let's go.
–Okay.

1215
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,440
Will you eat all the time?
–Won't you eat?

1216
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:25,840
You need not pay all the time.
–Revs, is this an issue?

1217
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:29,480
So what if I pay?
–Brother, one egg dosa.

1218
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,440
I'm saying you need not
pay all the time.

1219
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,800
What does that make me?
–Really?

1220
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,320
Brother, one egg dosa
for me too.

1221
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,000
Nice omelet.
–Right.

1222
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,240
Rajeev is calling.
–I know, I need to finish this.

1223
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:56,880
You're gone then.
–Keep quiet.

1224
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,560
No! Take this here.

1225
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,920
I'll call you
once I'm done with work, okay?

1226
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:21,200
How is this?

1227
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,640
I'm not in the mood.

1228
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:29,440
Daddy.
–Hi, Revathi.

1229
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,040
It's raining cats and dogs.

1230
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:39,560
Hello! Dad just arrived.
Can I call you later?

1231
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:42,200
Okay.

1232
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,960
Dad!

1233
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,680
I really love Rajeev.

1234
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:55,080
But he expects me to spend time
with him when I have no work.

1235
01:36:55,400 --> 01:37:00,600
I miss him too.
But I have my work too.

1236
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,480
Besides him,
I have other activities.

1237
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,400
I wonder
why he can't understand.

1238
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:12,280
He only thinks about himself.
And he is very possessive.

1239
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:19,200
Revathi, men are afraid
of strong and independent women.

1240
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,080
They will feel vulnerable.

1241
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:25,480
They won't know that
you can take care of yourself.

1242
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,240
Their ego will get hurt.

1243
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,920
Eventually he will understand.
Give him some time.

1244
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:41,520
Hi, Revathi!
–Hi.

1245
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,320
It's okay, I'll go on my own.
I need to focus on my work.

1246
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,240
<i>So, can't you focus</i>
<i>if I am there?</i>

1247
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:56,880
<i>I need to talk to people. If</i>
<i>you're there, you will be alone.</i>

1248
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,240
<i>I won't be able to concentrate.</i>
<i>Try to understand.</i>

1249
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,200
<i>Revs, I did not see</i>
<i>you for 3 days.</i>

1250
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,120
<i>I have work and meetings too.</i>

1251
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:08,040
<i>Don't I spare time for you?</i>
<i>But you're making me beg you.</i>

1252
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:13,320
I didn't ask you to beg.
I have work, that's all.

1253
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,400
We'll meet tomorrow.

1254
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:19,360
Don't make this an issue,
please, okay?

1255
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,720
Bye!
<i>–Bye!</i>

1256
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,640
Revathi!

1257
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:33,440
Are you going
to stand here all night?

1258
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:35,800
No.

1259
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,760
If you keep thinking,
the photographers will leave.

1260
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:43,640
Is that okay?
–No, I can't think straight.

1261
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,320
What?
–Yes.

1262
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:50,000
When somebody you love doesn't
understand you much,...

1263
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:55,320
...I only wanted one man
to fully understand me.

1264
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,320
But he doesn't seem
to understand.

1265
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,800
I wanted to ask you.

1266
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,600
You have your ex–boyfriend's
photos on Facebook.

1267
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,880
Won't you delete it?
–Why should I?

1268
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,520
Why should you keep them?
Any emotional values?

1269
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:21,200
Emotional value?
Nothing like that.

1270
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:27,000
Memories, that's all.
It's all in the past.

1271
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:33,040
What?
–I don't like it. Delete it.

1272
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:42,640
Don't start again, Rajeev.
I don't like wasting my energy...

1273
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:45,080
...by fighting with you.
–Then why fight?

1274
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,360
Do something for me
at least once.

1275
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:52,160
What nonsense!
I can't do this.

1276
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,520
What is this?
Why give me such instruction?

1277
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,280
You love to fight.

1278
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,360
Are you mad?
What's wrong with you?

1279
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:19,800
What's wrong with this dress?
–It's nice.

1280
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,760
If you dress
like a girl for once,..

1281
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:26,880
...with a beautiful salwar and
some makeup, you'll look better.

1282
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,880
Okay, sorry. I'm sorry.
–I'm sorry? What?

1283
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,520
Don't I look like a woman
dressed like this?

1284
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:40,880
I did not mean that.
–You're all the same.

1285
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,920
You are like other men.

1286
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:45,200
I thought you
were different, Rajeev.

1287
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,840
How can you say this?
I don't like it.

1288
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:51,840
I only meant it as a joke.
–Is this a joke?

1289
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,120
Don't you know I'm like this?

1290
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:56,680
Don't you know
how much I love you?

1291
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,000
This is not love, Rajeev,
this is obsession.

1292
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:04,080
You're trying to possess me.
–Fine, let's go.

1293
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,080
Things are not right,
I'm not coming anywhere.

1294
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:09,920
I want to be alone.

1295
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,760
Hey!
–I want to be alone.

1296
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,160
Don't you know
you're over reacting?

1297
01:41:22,280 --> 01:41:26,920
There are many couples in town.
But not everyone fights like you.

1298
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,280
Very good.
Then go to those girls.

1299
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,680
Who is holding you back?

1300
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,160
No, I.....
–Just leave me alone.

1301
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:25,520
Good, you started this topic.

1302
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:31,680
I've been thinking too.
This won't work.

1303
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:37,080
It is not working.
I want to break–up.

1304
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,960
Break–up?

1305
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,200
I like you, Rajeev,
you know that.

1306
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:46,720
But I can't live like this.

1307
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:50,520
And you know that you won't change.

1308
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:53,960
No, Revs, wait.
Please, let's take some time.

1309
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,520
No, Rajeev, I've been thinking
about this for some time.

1310
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:01,320
When you started telling me whom
to talk and whom not to talk,...

1311
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,480
...I felt this way.

1312
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:08,560
But I couldn't let you go,
because I fell for you.

1313
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,120
I didn't want to make
a hasty decision.

1314
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:16,280
But I can't.

1315
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:20,120
Revs, please, don't be hasty.
Listen to me.

1316
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:22,440
I need my space.

1317
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:25,600
It's suffocating.

1318
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:29,680
I can't hurt you
and hurt myself.

1319
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,680
This is it.

1320
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:38,280
I've gone out with many people.
I've had flings too.

1321
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:44,360
I was even engaged once.
But I didn't love anyone like you.

1322
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,760
I feel like my world
has shattered, Revs.

1323
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,960
I'm sorry, Rajeev.

1324
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:47,520
Have you finished editing?
–Yes, done.

1325
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:51,680
Why are you dull?
Is it because of Rajeev?

1326
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,560
Yes, I miss him a lot.

1327
01:44:58,160 --> 01:44:59,720
I keep looking at the phone.

1328
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,800
I can't think
about anything else.

1329
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:08,120
This is all I think about.
–Do you regret it?

1330
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,080
Definitely not,
this is the right decision.

1331
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,640
There is an assignment in Kerala.
Do you want to go?

1332
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:16,160
Give me some time.
I'll think and let you know.

1333
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:11,080
Rajeev, your numbers are very low.
You come and go as you wish.

1334
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:14,440
And your performance is very bad.
I didn't expect this from you.

1335
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,560
That's it, right?
Your dream girl,...

1336
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:23,200
...love of your life chapter?
Is this why you broke off...

1337
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:24,880
...your engagement?
–Why are you doing this?

1338
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,680
I thought you'll console me.
But you're rubbing...

1339
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,960
...salt on my wound?

1340
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:33,840
Things were fine between us.
I don't know what happened.

1341
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,800
It was too good to be true.

1342
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:41,560
I was afraid I'll lose,...

1343
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,240
...now I really missed her.

1344
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:51,200
I was in a love daze.

1345
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:55,400
But I didn't expect her
to break off with me.

1346
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,680
Forget it, she is not
the right girl for you.

1347
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:02,080
I don't get it, she dumped you.
Why are you still like this?

1348
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,360
You won't understand.
–She won't suit your family.

1349
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:11,480
She's a wonder.
I missed her.

1350
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,880
Why don't you write a book
on this relationship?

1351
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,200
What are you saying?
–A great writer once said.

1352
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:19,360
If you want to forget a girl,
turn her into a book.

1353
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:22,480
So, write.
–Do I look like a clown to you?

1354
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:26,600
Slightly.
–I keep thinking about her...

1355
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:29,560
...all the time.
I must go somewhere.

1356
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:41,600
Goa, dude.
–Goa? Great idea.

1357
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:45,800
But I can't come.
–Thanks, I want to go alone.

1358
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:55,200
Mom, dad won't talk to me.
Revathi broke off with me.

1359
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:59,680
I feel miserable.
I took leave.

1360
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,840
I want to go to Goa.
–Why are you telling me?

1361
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:12,440
Why is he telling us these things?
Let him do whatever he wants.

1362
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,720
I'm not bothered.
–Tell him I won't go anywhere.

1363
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,960
He need not stay back for me.

1364
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,440
If we say this, he'll say that.
If we say that, he'll say this.

1365
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:28,200
Looks like Revathi ditched him.

1366
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:33,200
Is this why he rejected
his fiancee, Shreya?

1367
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:40,800
Yes, I won't be around for 2 weeks.
–Where is this yoga retreat?

1368
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,640
Kodaikanal.

1369
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:52,840
Hello, okay, I'll take it up.

1370
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,640
When do I need to go
to Alleppey?

1371
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:59,200
Hi, excuse me. Can you tell me
where I can learn surfing?

1372
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,080
Or whom should I contact?

1373
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:04,920
Look at that girl.

1374
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:08,400
She?
–Yeah, she's a freelancer.

1375
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:11,120
Talk to her.
–Okay, thanks a lot.

1376
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,960
Excuse me, I heard
you're a surfing instructor.

1377
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,000
Yeah.
–Nice. I want to learn surfing.

1378
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:34,800
How long are you here for?
–As long as you want me to.

1379
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,160
I mean, just to learn surfing.
–Hi, I'm Athena.

1380
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,240
Hi, Rajeev.
–Where are you from?

1381
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,720
I'm from Chennai.
–Tamil?

1382
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:44,000
Yes.
–My father is a Tamil.

1383
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:46,720
My mom is a Goan.
–Seriously?

1384
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:49,240
I can't believe I'm seeing
a beautiful girl in Goa.....

1385
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,080
I mean,
of course you are beautiful.

1386
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:55,080
A half Tamilan who knows surfing.
No way! So weird.

1387
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,800
<i>Come like a wave,</i>
<i>it will never rest...</i>

1388
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:30,480
<i>We are a source of wonder,</i>
<i>nothing that can stop us...</i>

1389
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:35,480
<i>Like the sky,</i>
<i>if we rise,...</i>

1390
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:38,840
<i>Won't the rain shower on us...</i>

1391
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:42,640
<i>If you fight</i>
<i>and not give up...</i>

1392
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:46,120
<i>Our heart will be spared...</i>

1393
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:52,240
<i>I've crossed the love fence...</i>

1394
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:59,200
<i>I'm looking</i>
<i>for a fresh new start...</i>

1395
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:06,520
<i>I flew past love valley...</i>

1396
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:13,800
<i>I looked for a new land...</i>

1397
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:02,640
<i>Life is amazing...</i>

1398
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:09,680
<i>My sky is getting drenched...</i>

1399
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:17,120
<i>The river is getting</i>
<i>washed away...</i>

1400
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:24,680
<i>I get lost every day...</i>

1401
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:29,640
<i>Something seeps into my heart</i>
<i>very quickly...</i>

1402
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:39,040
<i>I've crossed the love fence...</i>

1403
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:45,920
<i>I'm looking</i>
<i>for a fresh new start...</i>

1404
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:53,440
<i>I flew past love valley...</i>

1405
01:53:55,280 --> 01:54:00,720
<i>I looked for a new land...</i>

1406
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:25,480
Athena is a Greek name, right?
–Goddess of Wisdom.

1407
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:29,000
My boyfriend, Antonia,
likes to tease me.

1408
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:32,720
It seems I am Athena.
So, I'm the Goddess of reasoning.

1409
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:36,000
Don't laugh. I speak Tamil
only at times like this.

1410
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:38,920
No, I'm surprised
you speak so well.

1411
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:43,800
I studied in WCC.
–Really? Cheers!

1412
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:52,200
I feel so calm.
If I was in Chennai,...

1413
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,360
...I would be fiddling
with my phone.

1414
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:57,000
I can't put it away
for even 5 minutes.

1415
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:00,360
If I am online, I'll be checking
FB every half an hour.

1416
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:05,120
But here, there is
no work pressure at all.

1417
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:09,360
So relaxing.
–I can imagine.

1418
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:13,640
I can't stay
in Chennai permanently.

1419
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,720
I'll go crazy.

1420
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:20,120
This sea, surfing and music,
they are my life.

1421
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:24,240
Right, I wouldn't understand
if I had stayed in Chennai.

1422
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:27,440
Fine, you look disturbed.

1423
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:29,960
Do I look like that?

1424
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:36,200
Actually I messed up.
My girlfriend left me.

1425
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:40,160
At times, people don't know
how to be happy.

1426
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:44,040
They'll want more and
lose everything they have.

1427
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:48,280
Just like me.
–Things have happened.

1428
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,320
How long are you going
to think about it?

1429
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:54,600
You have to move on.
–I'm trying to forget her.

1430
01:55:55,440 --> 01:56:00,800
But I do know
that only she makes me happy.

1431
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:04,280
Sometimes we won't
get what we want.

1432
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:06,840
You must console yourself.
–I know.

1433
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:10,680
I'm recollecting
the moments I spent with her.

1434
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,280
Okay, I've got to go.
Antonio will be waiting for me.

1435
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,640
I'll see you tomorrow.

1436
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:24,480
Bye!
–Bye!

1437
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:36,520
You don't even want to answer
my calls. How are you?

1438
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:40,760
This is life.
I'm learning how to surf.

1439
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:43,800
Suffering from.....
–It's very therapeutic.

1440
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,200
Therapeutic?
–I just realised,...

1441
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:50,120
...I was emotionally drained out
when I was with Revathi.

1442
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:53,240
Okay, don't irritate me.
When are you coming back home?

1443
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:56,920
I'm going to extend my trip.
I don't plan to come back.

1444
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:00,120
It's relaxing here,
I'm myself here.

1445
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:04,760
So, back to normal?
–I'm better off here.

1446
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:07,280
If I come there,
I will be haunted by her thoughts.

1447
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:12,280
What? What does that mean?
–Revathi's thoughts will haunt me.

1448
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:16,080
You mean, haunted by her thoughts?
–Seriously.

1449
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,800
Okay, forget it,
I'll call you later.

1450
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,240
Okay, dude, catch you soon.

1451
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:33,640
Bye!
–Bye!

1452
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:37,640
Can we go out together?

1453
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,320
No, I'm not feeling well.

1454
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:43,040
Okay, bye!
–Bye!

1455
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:17,240
Athena, what happened?
–Rajeev, you misunderstood.

1456
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:20,080
I told you,
I'm with my boyfriend.

1457
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:22,440
And I am very much with him.

1458
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,880
We give each other space.

1459
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:28,760
Only when there is space,
love can grow and sustain.

1460
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
And most importantly,
we trust each other.

1461
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:37,560
Evan if I am close to you,
I know my limit.

1462
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,720
When you talk to other boys,
your boyfriend won't mind?

1463
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:46,000
Thank God he is not like that.
He is not insecure.

1464
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,520
What if the girl
does not go back to him?

1465
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:53,440
Then the girl
is not meant for him.

1466
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,200
<i>I do not look at his Facebook</i>
<i>or Instagram page...</i>

1467
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:15,400
<i>...before going to sleep now.</i>

1468
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:17,840
<i>When I eat spicy food,</i>
<i>I do not think about him.</i>

1469
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:22,160
<i>Even we go to our regular spots,</i>
<i>I do not think of him.</i>

1470
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:25,280
<i>Even though he supported me,</i>
<i>he pushed me down.</i>

1471
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:28,200
<i>Even though he helped me,</i>
<i>he gave me problems.</i>

1472
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:30,840
<i>I don't know if he made me</i>
<i>understand love...</i>

1473
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:33,720
<i>...or make me hate love.</i>

1474
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:37,320
<i>But he definitely played</i>
<i>a part in my growth.</i>

1475
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,160
<i>A big thanks to him for that.</i>

1476
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:43,200
<i>The good thing is that,</i>
<i>I don't feel a disaster...</i>

1477
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:46,000
<i>...has happened</i>
<i>in my life anymore.</i>

1478
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:48,800
<i>I take things as they come.</i>

1479
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:52,720
<i>Whether something</i>
<i>happens or not,...</i>

1480
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:55,560
<i>...I'm mature enough to accept</i>
<i>whatever that comes along.</i>

1481
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:58,760
<i>I only have space and energy for</i>
<i>the things that are meant for me.</i>

1482
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:01,560
<i>It's a huge change.</i>

1483
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:03,120
<i>I have courage</i>
<i>to do anything now.</i>

1484
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:07,120
<i>The courage to trust myself.</i>
<i>The courage to start all over.</i>

1485
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:10,080
<i>The courage to seek new love.</i>

1486
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:14,120
<i>I have a new vigour in me,</i>
<i>something new to me.</i>

1487
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,920
<i>It feels good.</i>

1488
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:27,880
Hey!
–Hey!

1489
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,680
Thank you so much.

1490
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:33,040
You are amazing.

1491
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:35,120
Just like Antonio said,
you are a goddess.

1492
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:37,640
Okay.
–Take care. Bye!

1493
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:39,760
Keep in touch.

1494
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:49,280
I'll miss you. Bye!
–Bye!

1495
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:57,000
<i>There was something</i>
<i>about Athena.</i>

1496
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:58,840
<i>It's not love.</i>

1497
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:01,840
<i>It's an experience</i>
<i>I won't forget in my life.</i>

1498
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,120
<i>I learnt about life from Shreya,</i>
<i>Revathi and Athena.</i>

1499
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:07,520
<i>I realise now that every</i>
<i>relationship should have...</i>

1500
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:10,640
<i>...an individual space.</i>
<i>I also know...</i>

1501
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:12,920
<i>...we must not force</i>
<i>our ideology on someone else.</i>

1502
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:16,480
<i>I look at everything</i>
<i>as lessons in my life.</i>

1503
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,200
<i>But one should</i>
<i>be open to learn from it.</i>

1504
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:22,240
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>I'm a much better person now.</i>

1505
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:25,200
<i>I've grown emotionally</i>
<i>and spiritually.</i>

1506
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:52,080
Hello!
–Hi, Shreya. How are you?

1507
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:58,280
I'm good. How are you?
–I'm good.

1508
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:01,360
Can we meet if you are free?

1509
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:05,840
Sure, we can meet.

1510
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:09,160
Okay, I'll tell you
when and where.

1511
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,800
Okay.

1512
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:19,920
How are you, Shreya?
–I'm good.

1513
02:02:20,040 --> 02:02:22,440
Things are better now.
–Nice.

1514
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:26,040
Things that shouldn't
happen have happened.

1515
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:30,120
I'm really sorry.
Lets not talk about the past.

1516
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:35,680
How are you?
–I'm great.

1517
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:40,200
I just got back from Goa.
–Goa?

1518
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,880
I wanted a break.

1519
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,400
I deserved one. Now I feel great.

1520
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:48,040
I feel really good.

1521
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:51,960
Excuse me.
–Yeah.

1522
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:57,720
Hi! Can I call you shortly?
Okay, bye.

1523
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:01,120
Was that your boyfriend?
–No.

1524
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,520
By the way you say no,
I know it is.

1525
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,840
But I'm happy
to see you like this.

1526
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:08,920
I'm actually happy for you.

1527
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:13,400
Do you like him?
–I think so.

1528
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:17,360
Have you told him?

1529
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:20,800
No, I'll take my time.

1530
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,480
I'm trying really hard
not to get hurt again.

1531
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:27,440
I hurt you a lot, right?

1532
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:32,160
I allowed you to hurt me.

1533
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:39,360
Bye! Keep in touch, okay?
–Bye!

1534
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:41,560
Sure, thanks for calling
and meeting up with me.

1535
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:45,560
It was nice meeting you. Bye.
–Bye.

1536
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:15,360
Feeling sad, dude.

1537
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:18,520
Me too, dude.
–I'll post this in Facebook.

1538
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:21,400
Make sure you like it.
–Why do you do this?

1539
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,680
I don't know if I will miss
this office, but I'll miss you.

1540
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:29,040
Put this as your status,
I'll like it. It's super.

1541
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:32,200
Get lost!

1542
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:35,120
Hey, at least say something.

1543
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,040
One minute.

1544
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:36,240
This is my ex–boyfriend.
–He is good looking.

1545
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:41,240
Yes, but it did not work out.
–Seriously.

1546
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:43,520
We broke up.

1547
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:49,080
Come on, what are you doing?
–Show me, I won't do anything.

1548
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:51,440
Don't do that, please!

1549
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:58,360
<i>Without you,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have noticed...</i>

1550
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:01,680
<i>...the beautiful</i>
<i>little things in life,...</i>

1551
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:05,160
<i>...I would have focused</i>
<i>in my career like anyone else...</i>

1552
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:08,160
<i>...without growing</i>
<i>spiritually and emotionally.</i>

1553
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:10,640
<i>That's nice to hear.</i>

1554
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:14,640
<i>I'm glad to be in touch</i>
<i>with you after a long gap.</i>

1555
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:17,440
<i>I thought I had missed you.</i>

1556
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:20,000
<i>There is no need for anyone</i>
<i>to miss their loved ones.</i>

1557
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:24,240
<i>Right, it has been ages.</i>
<i>–So, you missed me.</i>

1558
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:28,600
<i>So directly?</i>
<i>Yes. What about you?</i>

1559
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,120
<i>I'm in Sri Lanka</i>
<i>for an assignment.</i>

1560
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:34,440
<i>I'll be here for some time,</i>
<i>at least for a month.</i>

1561
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:38,640
<i>Sri Lanka?</i>
<i>Your life is always exciting.</i>

1562
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:42,120
<i>By the way, you have not</i>
<i>answered my question.</i>

1563
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:53,560
<i>I think our separation</i>
<i>was a blessing indeed.</i>

1564
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:57,200
<i>To make your life exciting</i>
<i>is in your hands.</i>

1565
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:03,280
<i>Are you still with HG?</i>
<i>–No, I left the job.</i>

1566
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:06,240
<i>But I'm not into fancy</i>
<i>adventure like I told you.</i>

1567
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:08,720
<i>I mean, I am doing sales,</i>
<i>but in another company.</i>

1568
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:12,360
<i>How can I let go of my career</i>
<i>which is successful?</i>

1569
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,640
<i>As long as you enjoy the job</i>
<i>you are doing, it is fine.</i>

1570
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:39,120
<i>Don't get me wrong, Rajeev.</i>
<i>Let's just chat for now.</i>

1571
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:45,040
<i>I don't want anything serious.</i>
<i>–Anyone in your life now?</i>

1572
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:50,480
<i>Maybe or maybe now.</i>
<i>–Why the secret?</i>

1573
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:58,360
<i>I don't wish to be in any serious</i>
<i>relationship for now.</i>

1574
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:01,880
<i>Now I can understand you.</i>

1575
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,120
<i>It feels good to be</i>
<i>chatting with you now.</i>

1576
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:06,840
<i>I'm happy I'm talking</i>
<i>to you again now.</i>

1577
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:09,720
<i>Will you be upset if you do not</i>
<i>receive any messages...</i>

1578
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:12,040
<i>...from me for 2 days?</i>
<i>Will you miss me?</i>

1579
02:08:13,880 --> 02:08:16,160
<i>If there are no messages,</i>
<i>I'll miss you.</i>

1580
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,080
<i>But I won't be confused.</i>

1581
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:21,600
<i>You could be busy</i>
<i>or may not have anything to say.</i>

1582
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:24,520
<i>But I know</i>
<i>you'll be waiting for me.</i>

1583
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:27,400
<i>I'm confident</i>
<i>that we'll stay in touch.</i>

1584
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:29,840
<i>It's new coming from you.</i>
<i>I didn't expect this.</i>

1585
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:34,680
<i>The old Rajeev</i>
<i>wouldn't have said this.</i>

1586
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:45,360
This is my living room.

1587
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:50,480
This is the view
from my living room.

1588
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:57,280
I'll show you someone.
Come here!

1589
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:03,880
This is my friend, Natasha.
I'm staying in her house.

1590
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:12,160
<i>When will you return to Chennai?</i>
<i>–In 3 weeks.</i>

1591
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:16,000
<i>That's not very long.</i>
<i>I don't think you'll meet...</i>

1592
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:18,720
<i>...someone like Dulquer Salmaan</i>
<i>within these 3 weeks.</i>

1593
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:22,520
<i>Where did this come from?</i>
<i>Look, you have not changed.</i>

1594
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:26,520
<i>You are the same Rajeev.</i>
<i>–Can't that happen?</i>

1595
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:30,440
<i>Fine, if it happens?</i>
<i>–I'll miss an excellent girl...</i>

1596
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:34,640
<i>...for the second time.</i>
<i>–Rajeev, don't start again.</i>

1597
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:37,440
<i>Can we not talk about love?</i>

1598
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:42,360
<i>Come what may, Rajeev.</i>

1599
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:44,360
<i>I hope you're not thinking</i>
<i>about me anymore.</i>

1600
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,280
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>I'll be thinking about you?</i>

1601
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,480
<i>Shut up, I know you very well.</i>

1602
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:53,920
<i>Someone said he has moved on.</i>
<i>–I'm not sure.</i>

1603
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:57,920
<i>To be frank, to say I do not</i>
<i>think about you at all is a lie.</i>

1604
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,480
<i>I'm open about</i>
<i>meeting other girls.</i>

1605
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:03,640
<i>I'm still meeting them.</i>

1606
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:07,720
<i>Don't look for me in them.</i>
<i>–How does she know?</i>

1607
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:12,840
<i>She knows me so well.</i>
<i>Why do you think I would do so?</i>

1608
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:14,760
<i>I know about you.</i>

1609
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:23,440
What are you doing here? 
–I'm going to Sri Lanka.

1610
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:26,680
Revathi is there. 
I want to surprise her.

1611
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:29,800
What is it? 
–Aren't you taking your guitar?

1612
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:32,560
Hey! 
–Your love is over.

1613
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:37,640
Right, but we're in touch again. 
I think she's the one for me.

1614
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:42,120
She's the flavour of the month. 
–I'm serious.

1615
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:43,920
You're going to Sri Lanka.

1616
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:45,720
Enjoy. 
–Where are you going?

1617
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:48,120
Bangkok.
–Bangkok? What for?

1618
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:51,560
Office annual review meeting.
Bangkok for that?

1619
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:54,960
And you're not happy.
–I'm waiting an hour.

1620
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:58,760
Won't you change?
–Heard you get it in Sri Lanka too.

1621
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:01,520
Really? Shall I call your wife?
–Go to the Buddhist temples.

1622
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:04,280
It will be great.
Don't tell my wife and fix me up.

1623
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:05,880
Bye!

1624
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:08,760
Okay, bye.
–Bye.

1625
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:15,800
<i>It's time to talk</i>
<i>the truth, Rev.</i>

1626
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:21,000
<i>You must speak your heart.</i>
<i>I know you still love me.</i>

1627
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:24,640
<i>One, you might be hiding it.</i>

1628
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:27,120
<i>Or you do not realise it.</i>

1629
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:31,120
<i>We have moved on</i>
<i>from our past relationship.</i>

1630
02:11:31,720 --> 02:11:34,200
<i>Now you must say</i>
<i>what you want.</i>

1631
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:04,920
Rajeev?

1632
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:06,920
You're Revathi's
ex–boyfriend, right?

1633
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:10,960
Yeah, Natasha?
Hi! Nice to meet you.

1634
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:13,280
You do look handsome.
–Thanks.

1635
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:17,080
Do you know where Revathi is?
–Even if I do, why must I tell you?

1636
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:21,960
Because I love her sincerely.
I came to Sri Lanka because of her.

1637
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:24,400
Do you know how tough
it was to find this place?

1638
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:27,200
That's so scary.

1639
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:30,000
I'm scared.
–Scared? Why?

1640
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,760
Both of you have phones.
You exchange messages.

1641
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:37,960
Then what?
–No, it's just a surprise.

1642
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:41,640
You need to respect her privacy.
If she wants to see you,...

1643
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:45,440
...she'll contact you.
–She'll be fine once she see me.

1644
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:49,600
I don't want to be part of it.
–Please, Natasha.

1645
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:54,040
Only you can do it.
–Okay.

1646
02:12:54,960 --> 02:13:00,400
She's at the bird sanctuary.
I don't why I'm telling you this.

1647
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:04,200
I shouldn't tell you.
Anyway, good luck.

1648
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:06,640
I wish you'll get her back.

1649
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:52,080
Hi, Rajeev.
–Hi!

1650
02:13:52,200 --> 02:13:55,600
What a surprise!
–Yes, I came to see you.

1651
02:13:56,240 --> 02:13:59,480
So good to see you.
–How did you find this place?

1652
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:17,720
It's late for me,
I've got to go.

1653
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:19,400
My boyfriend
will be waiting for me.

1654
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:22,520
Boyfriend? Are you
in a relationship already?

1655
02:14:24,240 --> 02:14:29,240
Even if I am not, what made you
think I'll come back to you?

1656
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:32,200
That won't happen.

1657
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:36,080
Bye!

1658
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:39,920
Take care, all the best.
–Bye.

1659
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:34,840
Would you like to join me
for a cup of coffee?

1660
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:39,000
Can we have coffee?
–What for?

1661
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:42,800
Nothing, I thought we could discuss
our country's economic policy.
